    "main_text": "Aristotelian Tenets, Platonic Tenets, and More || Miracles, Magic, and Physiognomy\n4.3 Miracles, Magic, and Physiognomy\n\nIn the Middle Ages authors like Pietro of Abano, Nicolas Oresme, and\nJohn Buridan argued that any phenomenon, in particular those which\nwere usually believed to be supernatural or miraculous, could be\nexplained according to natural principles as the result of hidden\ncauses. A number of Renaissance thinkers also adopted this approach,\nincluding Pietro Pomponazzi. In his De incantationibus,\nPomponazzi stated that men tend to consider phenomena wondrous when\nthey are not able to identify their causes as the work of demons or\nmiracles. Pomponazzi attributed apparently miraculous events to the\npower of imagination, to psychological states or to the influence of\nthe stars, since according to the Peripatetic paradigm the immutable\nfirst mover cannot have direct contact with the mutable sublunar\nworld, and therefore moves through secondary causes. Nonetheless,\ndespite his claim to speak purely secundum Aristotelem,\nPomponazzi relied on a wider range of readings, including Marsilio\nFicino. And in making these claims, Pomponazzi encroaches on very\nsensitive questions of religious faith. In his view, Christian\nmiracles can be understood in the context of a sort of philosophy of\nhistory, founded on the horoscope of religions: when a religion\nbegins, miracles occur, which are caused by starry influences, and\nwhen a religion declines, miracles disappear, because starry\ninfluences are weaker. This paradigm involved a rigid organization of\nthe universe, which left little or no space for free will. Pomponazzi\ntook this doctrine to its logical extreme in his De fato, a\nwork in which he claimed to endorse Stoicism, while in reality\nexposing the determinism embedded in the Aristotelian doctrine of\ncauses. Other Aristotelians who sought to avoid this determinism\nusually relied on the moderate position of Alexander of Aphrodisias,\nwho Pomponazzi attacked in the first part of his treatise. While\nPomponazzi reached these conclusions drawing on multiple sources,\nother authors, such as Gerardus Bucoldianus, Simone Porzio, and\nLudovico Boccadiferro preferred to rely solely on Aristotle in order\nto explain wondrous events like cataclysms or the appearance of\nmonstrous creatures, like those described by Ulisse Aldrovandi\n(1522\u20131605), who interpreted them as deviations from the course\nof nature, or Fortunio Liceti (1577\u20131657), who preferred to link\nthe appearance of monsters to ingenious experiments of nature.\n\nNevertheless, this approach, which reduced the supernatural to the\nnatural, was not always coupled with Aristotelianism. On the contrary,\nit was often directed against Peripatetic doctrines, particularly when\nit relied on experimental and empirical observations. The search for\nthe occult causes of things, which was often related to magical\nbeliefs and practices, effectively stimulated new empirical\napproaches: Giovanbattista della Porta (1535\u20131615) was among\nthose who offered natural explanations for exceptional events while\ndiscarding the Aristotelian paradigm in favor of direct experience, in\nworks such as the Magiae naturalis sive de miraculis rerum\nnaturalium. Della Porta insisted on the sympathy and the\nantipathy of things, which are influenced by celestial virtues, when\ndealing with topics like optics and magnetism. And the De\nmagnete of the anti-Aristotelian William Gilbert\n(1544\u20131603) mixed experimentation (aimed at the demonstration of\nthe rotation and the magnetism of earth) with the belief in the\nexistence of a soul belonging to the earth. The occult properties of\nthings were also explored by other disciplines, such as medicine. Jean\nFernel (1497\u20131558) and Girolamo Fracastoro argued that occult\nproperties could be used to explain diseases and contagions.\n\nThe knowledge of the secrets of nature was in fact central to magic, a\nfield which had an ambiguous relationship to natural philosophy. If a\nnatural philosopher wanted to describe and understand nature, a\npractitioner of magic wanted to investigate it and its occult\nproperties in order to master it. The Neoplatonic correspondences\nbetween macrocosmus\u2014the world\u2014and\nmicrocosmus\u2014man\u2014allow magic to exercise its power\non a reality which was seen in vitalistic and transcendental terms:\nthe book of nature for practitioners of magic was not the same one as\nthat of the Aristotelians or of Galileo, but it was written with signs\nand allusions. Magical doctrines had a wide circulation throughout the\nMiddle Ages, but were enriched in the fifteenth century by the\nrediscovery of the Corpus Hermeticum. The Corpus was\na collection of heterogeneous texts, dealing both with practical magic\nand the mystical teachings attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, an\nEgyptian sage who purportedly lived at the time of Moses and was first\nin the lineage of a tradition of wisdom (the so-called prisca\ntheologia). The alleged antiquity of the Corpus\nrepresented the strongest evidence of its authority and reliability,\nand thinkers like Marsilio Ficino in his De vita, and then\nCornelius Agrippa (1486\u20131535) in his De occulta\nphilosophia, proposed doctrines based on it. Their readers were\nencouraged to carve talismans and images, and surround themselves with\nprecise colors or herbs connected to planetary influences in order to\nexploit the conjunction of the whole, a living being of which man is\nboth part and lord. Magical treatises included recipes and empirical\ndescriptions, and in his De augmentis Scientiarum even\nFrancis Bacon described magic as an operative knowledge of hidden\nforms and the harmony of things, which displays the wonderful works of\nnature. The connection between micro and macrocosmus\nalso underlay medical practice\u2014as in the case of Ficino himself\nand later Paracelsus\u2014and disciplines like physiognomy, which was\nconsidered part of the Aristotelian natural encyclopedia. Della\nPorta\u2019s De physiognomia humana (1586), which was mainly\na collection of past authorities that included ethical problems and\nwas accompanied by illustrations, became the standard text on the\ntopic until Lavater. There were also expressly hermetic approaches to\nthe subject, including the one by Robert Fludd (1574\u20131637).\n",
