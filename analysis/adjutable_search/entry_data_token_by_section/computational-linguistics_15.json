One aspect of this\ntendency towards \u201cshorthand\u201d is seen in anaphora,\nthe phenomenon of coreference between an earlier, potentially more\ndescriptive NP and a later anaphoric pronoun or definite NP (with a\ndeterminer like the or\nthese). (The reverse sequencing, cataphora, is seen\noccasionally as well.)  Coreference is yet another source of ambiguity\nin language, scarcely noticeable by human language users (except in\nambivalent cases such as \u201cWhen Flight 77 hit the Pentagon's\nwall, it disintegrated\u201d), but problematic for machines.\nDetermining the (co)referents of anaphors can be approached in a\nvariety of ways, as in the case of semantic disambiguation. Linguistic\nand psycholinguistic principles that have been proposed include\ngender and number agreement of coreferential terms,\nC-command principles (e.g., an anaphor must be a pronoun if\nits referent is a sibling of one of its ancestors in the parse tree),\n(non)reflexive constraints (e.g., the subject and\nobject cannot be coreferential in a simple clause such as\n\n\u201cJohn blamed him for the accident\u201d),\nrecency/salience (more recent/salient referents are preferred), and\ncentering (the most likely term to be pronominalized in an\nutterance is the \u201ccenter of attention\u201d). An early\nheuristic algorithm that employed several features of this type to\ninterpret anaphors was that of Hobbs (1979).  But selectional\npreferences are important as well. For example, in the sentence\n\u201cHe bumped against the sauce boat containing the\nraspberry syrup, spilling it,\u201d the pronoun can be\ndetermined to be coreferential with the raspberry syrup\nrather than the sauce boat because\nspill prefers a liquid (or loose aggregate) as its\nobject. With the alternative continuation, \u201c\u2026 knocking\nit over,\u201d the choice of coreferent would be reversed,\nbecause knock over prefers something solid and upright as its\nobject. More subtle world knowledge may be involved as well, as in\nTerry Winograd's well-known example, \u201cThe city council\nrefused the women a parade permit because they\nfeared/advocated violence,\u201d where\nthey may refer to the city council or the women, depending on\nthe choice of verb and the corresponding stereotypes that are\nevoked. Another complication concerns reference to collections of\nentities, related entities (such as parts), propositions, and events\nthat can become referents of pronouns (such as they, this,\nand that) or of definite NPs (such as this situation\nor the door (of the house)) without having appeared\nexplicitly as a noun phrase. Like other sorts of ambiguity,\ncoreference ambiguity has been tackled with statistical techniques.\nThese typically take into account factors like those mentioned, along\nwith additional features such as antecedent animacy and prior\nfrequency of occurrence, and use these as probabilistic evidence in\nmaking a choice of antecedent (e.g., Haghighi & Klein 2010).\nParameters of the model are learned from a corpus annotated with\ncoreference relations and the requisite syntactic analyses.\nComing back briefly to nominal compounds of form N N, note that\nunlike conventional compounds such as ice bucket or ice\nsculpture\u2014ones approachable using an enriched lexicon,\nheuristic rules, or statistical techniques\u2014some compounds can\nacquire a variety of meanings as a function of context. For\nexample, rabbit guy could refer to entirely different things\nin a story about a fellow wearing a rabbit suit, or one about a rabbit\nbreeder, or one about large intelligent leporids from outer\nspace. Such examples reveal certain parallels between compound nominal\ninterpretation and anaphora resolution: At least in the\nmore difficult cases, N N interpretation depends on previously seen\nmaterial, and on having understood crucial aspects of that previous\nmaterial (in the current example, the concepts of wearing a rabbit\nsuit, being a breeder of rabbits, or being a rabbit-like creature). In\nother words N N interpretation, like anaphora resolution, is\nultimately knowledge-dependent, whether that knowledge comes from\nprior text, or from a preexisting store of background knowledge. A\nstrong version of this view is seen in the work of Fan et\nal. (2009), where it is assumed that in technical contexts, even\nmany seemingly conventional compounds require knowledge-based\nelaboration. For example, in a chemistry context, HCL\nsolution is assumed to require elaboration into something\nlike: solution whose base is a chemical whose basic structural\nconstituents are HCL molecules. Algorithms are provided (and\ntested empirically) that search for a relational path (subject to\ncertain general constraints) from the modified N to the modifying N,\nselecting such a relational path as the meaning of the N N\ncompound. As the authors note, this is essentially a\nspreading-activation algorithm, and they suggest more general\napplication of this method\n (see section 5.3 on integrated interpretive\nmethods).\nWhile anaphors and certain nominal compounds can be regarded as\nabbreviated encodings of semantic content, other forms of\n\u201cshorthand\u201d leave out semantically essential material\naltogether, requiring the reader or hearer to fill it in. One\npervasive phenomenon of this type is of course ellipsis, as\nillustrated earlier in sentences\n (2.5) and (2.6), or by the following\nexamples.\n\n(5.1)  Shakespeare made up\nwords, and so can you.  \n\n (5.2)  Felix is under more pressure than I am.\n\n\nIn (5.1), so is a place-holder for the VP make up words (in an\ninverted sentence),  and (5.2) tacitly contains a final predicate\nsomething like under amount x of pressure, where that amount\nx needs to be related to the (larger) amount of pressure\nexperienced by Felix.  Interpreting ellipsis requires filling in of\nmissing material; this can often be found at the surface level as a\nsequence of consecutive words (as in the gapping and bare ellipsis\nexamples 2.5 and 2.6), but as seen in (5.1) and (5.2),  may\ninstead (or in addition) require adaptation of the imported material\nto fit semantically into the new context. Further complications arise\nwhen the imported material contains referring expressions, as in the\nfollowing variant of (5.2):\n\n(5.2\u2032) \n Felix is under more pressure from his boss than I\nam.\n\nHere the missing material  may refer either to Felix's boss\nor my boss (called the strict and sloppy\nreading respectively), a distinction that can be captured by regarding\nthe logical form of the antecedent VP as containing only one, or two,\noccurrences of the lambda-abstracted subject variable, i.e.,\nschematically,\n     \n\u03bbx[x is under more pressure from Felix's boss], versus \n\u03bbx[x is under more pressure from x's boss].\n\nThe two readings can be thought of as resulting respectively from\nscoping his boss first, then\nfilling in the elided material, and the\nreverse ordering of these operations (Dalrymple et al. 1991; see also\nCrouch 1995; Gregory and Lappin 1997). Other challenging forms of\nellipsis are event ellipsis, as in (5.3) (where forgot stands for\nforgot to bring), entirely\nverbless sentences such as (5.4) and (5.5),\nand subjectless, verbless ones like (5.6) and (5.7):\n\n(5.3)  I forgot the keys\n\n(5.4)  Hence this proposal \n(5.5)  Flights from Rochester to Orlando, May 28?\n\n(5.6)  What a pity.\n(5.7)  How about the Delta\nflight instead?\n\n\nIn applications these and some other forms of ellipsis are handled,\nwhere possible, by (a) making strong use of domain-dependent\nexpectations about the types of information and speech acts that are\nlikely to occur in the discourse, such as requests for flight\ninformation in an air travel adviser; and (b) interpreting utterances\nas providing augmentations or modifications of domain-specific\nknowledge representations built up so far. Corpus-based approaches to\nellipsis have so far focused mainly on identifying instances of VP\nellipsis in text, and finding the corresponding antecedent material, as\nproblems separate from that of computing correct logical forms (e.g.,\nsee Hardt 1997; Nielsen 2004).\nAnother refractory missing-material phenomenon is that of implicit\narguments. For example, in the sentence\n\n(5.8)  Some carbon monoxide\nleaked into the car from the exhaust, but its\nconcentration was too low to pose any hazard,\n\nthe reader needs to conceptually expand its concentration\ninto its concentration in the air in the interior of the car,\nand hazard into\nhazard for occupants of the car.\nIn this example, lexical knowledge to\nthe effect that concentration (in the chemical sense)  refers to\nthe concentration of some substance in some medium could at least\nprovide the \u201cslots\u201d that need to be filled, and a similar comment\napplies in the case of hazard.\nHowever, not all of the fillers for\nthose slots are made explicitly available by the text\u2014the carbon\nmonoxide referred to provides one of the fillers, but the air in the\ninterior of the car, and potential occupants of the car (and that they\nrather than, say, the upholstery would be at risk) are a matter of\ninference from world knowledge.\nFinally, another form of  shorthand that is common in certain\ncontexts is metonymy, where a\nterm saliently related to an intended\nreferent stands for that referent. For example, in an airport context,\n\n(5.9)   Is this flight 574?\n\n\nmight stand for \n\u201cIs this the departure lounge for flight 574?\u201d\nSimilarly, in appropriate contexts cherry\ncan stand for cherry ice\ncream, and BMW can\nstand for BMW's stock market index:\n\n(5.10)  I'd like two scoops\nof cherry.\n(5.11) BMW rose 4 points.\n\n\nLike other types of underspecification, metonymy has been\napproached both from knowledge-based and corpus-based\nperspectives. Knowledge that can be brought to bear includes\nselectional preferences (e.g., companies in general do not literally\nrise),  lexical concept hierarchies (e.g., as provided by\nWordNet), generic knowledge about the types of metonymy relations\ncommonly encountered, such as part-for-whole, place-for-event,\nobject-for-user, producer-for-product, etc. (Lakoff and Johnson\n1980), rules for when to conjecture such relations (e.g., Weischedel\nand Sondheimer 1983), named-entity knowledge, and knowledge about\nrelated entities (e.g., a company may have a stock market index, and\nthis index may rise or fall) (e.g., Bouaud et al. 1996; Onyshkevych\n1998).  Corpus-based methods (e.g., see Markert and Nissim 2007) often\nemploy many of these knowledge resources, along with linguistic and\nstatistical features such as POS tags, dependency paths and\ncollocations in the vicinity of a potential metonym. As for other\nfacets of the interpretive process (including parsing), use of deep\ndomain knowledge for metonym processing can be quite effective in\nsufficiently narrow domains, while corpus-based, shallow methods scale\nbetter to broader domains, but are apt to reach a performance plateau\nfalling well short of human standards.\n",
