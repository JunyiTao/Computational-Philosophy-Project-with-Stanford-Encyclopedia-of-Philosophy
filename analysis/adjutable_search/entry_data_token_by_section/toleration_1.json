    "main_text": "Four Conceptions of Toleration\n2. Four Conceptions of Toleration\n\nThe following discussion of four conceptions of toleration is not to\nbe understood as the reconstruction of a linear historical succession.\nRather, these are different, historically developed understandings of\nwhat toleration consists in that can all be present in society at the\nsame time, so that conflicts about the meaning of toleration may also\nbe understood as conflicts between these conceptions (cf. Forst\n2013).\n\n1. The first one I call the permission conception. According\nto it, toleration is a relation between an authority or a majority and\na dissenting, \u201cdifferent\u201d minority (or various\nminorities). Toleration then means that the authority gives qualified\npermission to the minority to live according to their beliefs on\ncondition that the minority accepts the dominant position of the\nauthority or majority. So long as their being different remains within\ncertain limits, that is, in the \u201cprivate\u201d realm, and so\nlong as the minority groups do not claim equal public and political\nstatus, they can be tolerated on pragmatic or principled\ngrounds\u2014on pragmatic grounds because this form of toleration is\nthe least costly of all possible alternatives and does not disturb\ncivil peace and order as the dominant party defines it (but rather\ncontributes to it); and on principled grounds because one may think it\nis morally problematic to force people to give up certain deep-seated\nbeliefs or practices.\n\nThe permission conception is a classic one that we find in many\nhistorical writings and in instances of a politics of toleration (such\nas the Edict of Nantes in 1598) and that\u2014to a considerable\nextent\u2014still informs our understanding of the term. According to\nthis conception, toleration means that the authority or majority,\nwhich has the power to interfere with the practices of a minority,\nnevertheless \u201ctolerates\u201d it, while the minority accepts\nits inferior position. The situation or the \u201cterms of\ntoleration\u201d are hierarchical: one party allows another party\ncertain things on conditions specified by the first one. Toleration is\nthus understood as permissio negativa mali: not interfering\nwith something that is actually wrong but not\n\u201cintolerably\u201d harmful. It is this conception that Goethe\n(1829, 507, transl. R.F.) had in mind when he said: \u201cTolerance\nshould be a temporary attitude only: it must lead to recognition. To\ntolerate means to insult.\u201d\n\n2. The second conception, the coexistence conception, is\nsimilar to the first one in regarding toleration as the best means\ntoward ending or avoiding conflict and toward pursuing one\u2019s own\ngoals. What is different, however, is the relationship between the\nsubjects and the objects of toleration. For now the situation is not\none of an authority or majority in relation to a minority, but one of\ngroups that are roughly equal in power, and who see that for the sake\nof social peace and the pursuit of their own interests mutual\ntoleration is the best of all possible alternatives (the Augsburg\nPeace Treaty of 1555 is a historical example). They prefer peaceful\ncoexistence to conflict and agree to a reciprocal compromise, to a\ncertain modus vivendi. The relation of tolerance is no longer\nvertical but horizontal: the subjects are at the same time the objects\nof toleration. This may not lead to a stable social situation in which\ntrust can develop, for once the constellation of power changes, the\nmore powerful group may no longer see any reasons for being tolerant\n(cf. Rawls 1987, 11, Fletcher 1996).\n\n3. Different from this, the third conception of toleration\u2014the\nrespect conception\u2014is one in which the tolerating\nparties respect one another in a more reciprocal sense (cf. Weale\n1985, Scanlon 1996). Even though they differ fundamentally in their\nethical beliefs about the good and true way of life and in their\ncultural practices, citizens recognize one another as moral-political\nequals in the sense that their common framework of social life\nshould\u2014as far as fundamental questions of rights and liberties\nand the distribution of resources are concerned\u2014be guided by\nnorms that all parties can equally accept and that do not favor one\nspecific ethical or cultural community (cf. Forst 2002, ch. 2).\n\nThere are two models of the \u201crespect conception,\u201d that of\n\u201cformal equality,\u201d and that of \u201cqualitative\nequality.\u201d The former operates on a strict distinction between\nthe political and the private realm, according to which ethical (i.e.,\ncultural or religious) differences among citizens of a legal state\nshould be confined to the private realm, so that they do not lead to\nconflicts in the political sphere. This version is clearly exhibited\nin the \u201csecular republicanism\u201d of the French authorities\nwho held that headscarves with a religious meaning have no place in\npublic schools in which children are educated to be autonomous\ncitizens (cf. Galeotti 1993).\n\nThe model of \u201cqualitative equality,\u201d on the other hand,\nrecognizes that certain forms of formal equality favor those\nethical-cultural life-forms whose beliefs and practices make it easier\nto accommodate a conventional public/private distinction. In other\nwords, the \u201cformal equality\u201d model tends to be intolerant\ntoward ethical-cultural forms of life that require a public presence\nthat is different from traditional and hitherto dominant cultural\nforms. Thus, on the \u201cqualitative equality\u201d model, persons\nrespect each other as political equals with a certain distinct\nethical-cultural identity that needs to be respected and tolerated as\nsomething that is (a) especially important for a person and (b) can\nprovide good reasons for certain exceptions from or general changes in\nexisting legal and social structures. Social and political equality\nand integration are thus seen to be compatible with cultural\ndifference\u2014within certain (moral) limits of reciprocity.\n\n4. In discussions of toleration, one finds alongside the conceptions\nmentioned thus far a fourth one which I call the esteem\nconception. This implies an even fuller, more demanding notion of\nmutual recognition between citizens than the respect conception does.\nHere, being tolerant does not just mean respecting members of other\ncultural life-forms or religions as moral and political equals, it\nalso means having some kind of ethical esteem for their beliefs, that\nis, taking them to be ethically valuable conceptions that\u2014even\nthough different from one\u2019s own\u2014are in some way ethically\nattractive and held with good reasons. For this still to be a case of\ntoleration, the kind of esteem characteristic of these relations is\nsomething like \u201creserved esteem,\u201d that is, a kind of\npositive acceptance of a belief that for some reason you still find is\nnot as attractive as the one you hold. As valuable as parts of the\ntolerated belief may be, it also has other parts that you find\nmisguided, or wrong (cf. Raz 1988, Sandel 1989).\n\nTo answer the question which of these conceptions should be the\nguiding one for a given society, two aspects are most important. The\nfirst one requires an assessment of the conflicts that require and\nallow for toleration, given the history and character of the groups\ninvolved; and the second requires an adequate and convincing normative\njustification of toleration in a given social context. It is important\nto keep in mind that the (normatively dependent) concept of toleration\nitself does not provide such a justification; this has to come from\nother normative resources. And the list of such resources, speaking\nboth historically and systematically, is long.\n",
