In particular, they\nrequire the default conditional operator, \\(\\Rightarrow\\), to have\nwide scope in every formula in which it appears. Default conditionals\nare not allowed to be nested within other default conditionals, or\nwithin the scope of the usual Boolean operators of propositional logic\n(negation, conjunction, disjunction, material conditional). This is a\nvery severe restriction and one that is quite difficult to defend. For\nexample, in representing undercutting defeaters, it would be\nvery natural to use a negated default conditional of the form\n\\(\\neg((p \\amp q) \\Rightarrow r)\\) to signify that \\(q\\) defeats \\(p\\)\nas a prima facie reason for \\(r\\). In addition, it seems plausible\nthat one might come gain\ndisjunctive default information: for example, that either\ncustomers are gullible or salesman are wily.\n\nAsher and Pelletier (Asher and Pelletier 1997) have argued that, when\ntranslating generic sentences in natural language, it is essential\nthat we be allowed to nest default conditionals. For example, consider\nthe following English sentences:\n\n\nClose friends are (normally) people who (normally) trust one\nanother.\n\nPeople who (normally) rise early (normally) go to bed early.\n\n\nIn the first case, a conditional is nested within the consequent of\nanother conditional:\n\n\\(\\forall x \\forall y (\\textit{Friend}(x,y) \\Rightarrow \\forall z\n(\\textit{Time}(z) \\Rightarrow \\textit{Trust}(x,y,z)))\\)\n\nIn the second case, we seem to have conditionals nested within both\nthe antecedent and the consequent of a third conditional, something\nlike:\n\n\n\\(\\forall x (\\textit{Person}(x) \\rightarrow\\) \\(\\ \\ (\\forall\n  y(\\textit{Day}(y) \\Rightarrow \\textit{Rise-early}(x,y)) \\Rightarrow\n  \\forall z (\\textit{Day}(z) \\Rightarrow\n  \\textit{Bed-early}(x,z))))\\)\n\nThis nesting of conditionals can be made possible by borrowing and\nmodifying the semantics of the subjunctive or counterfactual\nconditional, developed by Robert Stalnaker and David K. Lewis (Lewis\n1973). For an axiomatization of Lewis\u2019s conditional logic, see\nthe following supplementary document:\n\nDavid Lewis\u2019s Conditional Logic\n\n\nThe only modification that is essential is to drop the condition of\nCentering (both strong and weak), a condition that makes modus ponens\n(affirming the antecedent) logically valid. If the conditional \\(\\Rightarrow\\)\nis to represent a default conditional, we do not want modus ponens to\nbe valid: we do not want \\((p \\Rightarrow q)\\) and \\(p\\)\nto entail \\(q\\) classically (i.e., monotonically). If Centering\nis dropped, the resulting logic can be made to correspond exactly to\neither a preferential or a rational defeasible entailment relation.\nFor example, the condition of Rational Monotony is the exact\ncounterpart of the CV axiom of Lewis\u2019s logic:\n\nCV: \n\\((p \\Rightarrow q) \\rightarrow [((p \\amp r) \\Rightarrow q) \\vee(p\n\\Rightarrow \\neg r )]\\)\n\n\nSomething like this was proposed first by James Delgrande (Delgrande\n1987), and the idea has been most thoroughly developed by Nicholas\nAsher and his collaborators (Asher and Morreau 1991; Asher 1995; Asher\nand Bonevac 1996; Asher and Mao 2001) under the name Commonsense\n Entailment.[7]\n Commonsense Entailment is a preferential (although not a rational)\nconsequence relation, and it automatically satisfies the Specificity\nprinciple. It permits the arbitrary nesting of default conditionals\nwithin other logical operators, and it can be used to represent\nundercutting defeaters, through the use of negated defaults (Asher and\nMao 2001).\n\nThe models of Commonsense Entailment differ significantly from those\nof preferential logic and the logic of extreme probabilities. Instead\nof having structures that contain sets of models of a\nstandard, default-free language, a model of the language of\nCommonsense Entailment includes a set of possible worlds,\ntogether with a function that assigns standard interpretation (a model\nof the default-free language) to each world. In addition, to each pair\nconsisting of a world \\(w\\) and a set of worlds (proposition) \\(A\\),\nthere is a function \\(*\\) that assigns a set of worlds \\({*}(w,A)\\) to\nthe pair. The set \\({*}(w,A)\\) is the set of most normal \\(A\\)-worlds,\nfrom the perspective of \\(w\\). A default conditional \\((p \\Rightarrow\nq)\\) is true in a world \\(w\\) (in such a model) just in case all of\nthe most normal \\(p\\) worlds (from \\(w\\)\u2019s perspective) are\nworlds in which \\(q\\) is also true. Since we can assign\ntruth-conditions to each such conditional, we can define the truth of\nnested conditionals, whether the conditionals are nested within\nBoolean operators or within other conditionals. Moreover, we can\ndefine both a classical, monotonic consequence relation for this class\nof models and a defeasible, nonmonotonic relation (in fact, the\nnonmonotonic consequence relation can be defined in a variety of\nways). We can then distinguish between a default conditional\u2019s\nfollowing with logical necessity from a default theory and\nits following defeasibly from that same theory.\nContraposition, for example \u2014 inferring \\((\\neg q \\Rightarrow\n\\neg p)\\) from \\((p \\Rightarrow q)\\) \u2014 is not logically valid\nfor default conditionals, but it might be a defeasibly correct\n inference.[8]\n\nThe one critical drawback to Commonsense Entailment, when compared to\nthe logic of extreme probabilities, is that it lacks a single, clear\nstandard of normativity. The truth-conditions of the default\nconditional and the definition of nonmonotonic consequence can be\nfine-tuned to match many of our intuitions, but in the end of the day,\nthe theory of Commonsense Entailment offers no simple answer to the\nquestion of what its conditional or its consequence relation are\nsupposed (ideally) to represent.\n\nLogics of extreme probability (beginning with the work of Ernest\nAdams) did not permit the nesting of default conditionals for this\nreason: the conditionals were supposed to represent something like\nsubjective conditional probabilities of the agent, to which the agent\nwas supposed to have perfect introspective access. Consequently, it\nmade no sense to nest this conditionals within disjunctions (as though\nthe agent couldn\u2019t tell which disjunct represented his actual\nprobability assignment) or within other conditionals (since the\nsubjective probability of a subjective probability is always trivial\n\u2014 either exactly 1 or exactly 0). However, there is no reason\nwhy the logic of extreme probabilities couldn\u2019t be given a\ndifferent interpretation, with \\((p \\Rightarrow q)\\)\nrepresenting something like the objective probability of\n\\(q\\), conditional on \\(p\\), is infinitely close to 1.\nIn this case, it makes perfect sense to nest such statements of\nobjective conditional probability within Boolean operators (either the\nprobability of \\(q\\) on \\(p\\) is close to 1, or the\nprobability of \\(r\\) on \\(s\\) is close to 1), or within\noperators of objective probability (the objective probability that the\nobjective probability of \\(p\\) is close to 1 is itself close to\n1). What is required in the latter case is a theory of\nhigher-order probabilities.\n\nFortunately, such a theory of higher-order probabilities is available\n(see Skyrms 1980; Gaifman 1988). The central principle of this theory\nis Miller\u2019s principle. For a description of the models of the\nlogic of extreme, higher-order probability, see the following\nsupplementary document:\n\nModels of Higher-Order Probability\n\n\nThe following proposition is logically valid in this logic,\nrepresenting the presence of a defeasible modus ponens rule:\n\n\\(((p \\amp(p \\Rightarrow q)) \\Rightarrow q)\\)\n\n\nThis system can be the basis for a family of rational nonmonotonic\nconsequence relations that include the Adams \\(\\varepsilon\\)-entailment\nsystem as a proper part (see Koons 2000, 298\u2013319).\n",
