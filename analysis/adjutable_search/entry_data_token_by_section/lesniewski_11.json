    "main_text": "Mature Systems\n5. Mature Systems\n\n \nThroughout the 1920s, Le\u015bniewski and his students worked hard\nto improve the logical systems by finding single axioms, shorter\naxioms, trying out new primitives, and generally seeking logical\nperfection. The work, and Le\u015bniewski\u2019s involvement in\nteaching, were so intense that for several years he published nothing.\nAs this became something of an embarrassment, since his results were\nbeing quoted without being in print, he resolved to postpone a fully\nsystematic exposition and present instead a more autobiographical\naccount of how the systems arose and were improved. This took the form\nof two series of articles from 1927\u201331. One series, \u2018O\npodstawach matematyki\u2019 [\u2018On the Foundations of\nMathematics\u2019] appeared in the premier Polish philosophy journal\nPrzegl\u0105d Filozoficzny, and, eschewing mathematical\nsymbolism, was dedicated to an up-to-date exposition of Mereology. The\nother series, \u2018Grundz\u00fcge eines neuen Systems der Grundlagen\nder Mathematik\u2019 [\u2018Fundamentals of a New System of the\nFoundations of Mathematics\u2019] began to appear in 1929 in the\nmathematical journal Fundamenta Mathematicae, and was\ndedicated to Protothetic. Its 81 pages and 11 sections ended with the\npromise \u2018Fortsetzung folgt\u2019, \u2018Continuation\nfollows\u2019, but it did not, because in the meantime Le\u015bniewski\nhad fallen out with the other editors of the journal over the status of\nset theory. The article did not get beyond the preliminaries of\nProtothetic, setting out the history, axioms, and rules (directives)\nfor extending the system, and outlining a number of variants, but not\nstarting the deductions proper. It was not until a new logic journal\nCollectanea Logica was set up in 1938 that Le\u015bniewski was\nable to continue. After a 60-page introduction to the continuation,\n\u2018Einleitende Bemerkungen zur Fortsetzung meiner Mitteilung u.d.T.\n\u201cGrundz\u00fcge eines neuen Systems der Grundlagen der\nMathematik\u201d \u2019, summarizing the earlier article and bringing\nthe story up to date, there followed another 83 pages comprising\nSection 12, and listing twelve definitions and 422 theorems of\nProtothetic, with skeletal information about how they are derived,\nexpressed in Le\u015bniewski\u2019s own idiosyncratic notation for the\nconnectives and quantifiers. The journal did not appear in print\nbecause of the outbreak of the Second World War: the printing plates\nfrom which offprints had fortunately been made were destroyed in the\nbombing of Warsaw in September 1939, by which time Le\u015bniewski was\nalready dead.\n\n Le\u015bniewski\u2019s own notation for Protothetic is explained in\n\u2018Supplementary Remark III\u2019 of the Introductory Remarks:\none-place connectives are made up of a horizontal bar\n\u2018\u2013\u2019 supplementable at either end by a vertical bar\n\u2018|\u2019. A bar at the right-hand end of the line signifies the\nconnective gives output value T(rue) for input value T, the absence of\na bar signifies the output value for input T is F(alse).  Similarly a\nbar at the left-hand end of the line signifies output value T for\ninput value F, the absence of a bar signifies output F for input\nF. The four extensional one-place connectives are thus systematically\nnotated, with negation, the most important, written as\n\u2018\\(\\vdash\\)\u2019. For two-place connectives bars are added\nradially as spokes to a circular central hub\n\u2018\\(\\circ\\)\u2019. As before the presence of a bar indicates an\noutput value T, its absence an output value F. The top position is for\nfirst and second inputs F, the bottom position for first and second\ninputs T, the left position for first input T and second input F, the\nright position for first input F and second input T. Thus all sixteen\npossibilities are catered for. For example the conjunction connective\nis written \u2018\\(\\koppa\\)\u2019. If one connective H is contained\ngeometrically in another G, the implication G\\((pq) \\rightarrow\\)\nH\\((pq)\\) holds, and merging two connectives gives a connective\nequivalent to their conjunction. While this notation is systematic and\nelegant, it has never caught on. Like \u0141ukasiewicz,\nLe\u015bniewski always puts the connective before its arguments, but\nhe encloses the arguments in parentheses, thus the conjunction of\n\\(p\\) and \\(q\\) is written \u2018\\(\\koppa(pq)\\)\u2019. The reason\nfor parentheses, which \u0141ukasiewicz could dispense with, will\nbecome clear. In this \u201cofficial\u201d notation, the only\nquantifier is the universal, written by placing the variables bound\nbetween lower corners, as for example \u2018 \\(\\llcorner\npqf\\lrcorner\\) \u2019, and placing the quantifier scope or matrix\nwithin upper corners, so for example \u2018\\(\\llcorner pqf\\lrcorner\n\\ulcorner \\koppa(f(pq)f(qp))\\urcorner\\)\u2019 is\nLe\u015bniewski\u2019s way of writing what we write as\n\u2018\\(\\forall pqf\\ulcorner f(pq) \\wedge f(qp)\\urcorner\\)\u2019. In\nhis everyday logical work and derivations however, Le\u015bniewski\nused a slightly modified version of Whitehead and\nRussell\u2019s Principia Mathematica notation.\n\n Among the variant versions of Protothetic Le\u015bniewski mentions in\nhis 1929 article, one is a single-axiom version containing 82 signs.\n(In 1945 Soboci\u0144ski produced a single axiom version with 54 signs\nonly.) The other and more interesting idea is an algorithmic or\n\u201ccomputative\u201d system of Protothetic, mentioned above in\nSection 8. This is in effect a way to formalize the idea of\ntruth-tables, but applied beyond truth-functions of sentences to more\ncomplex functors with arguments of first and higher order\ntruth-functions. Le\u015bniewski does not take the idea very far, but\nit was subsequently developed further by Owen Le Blanc (1991).\n\n To modern students of logic accustomed to streamlined methods of\nworking with propositional logic, Le\u015bniewski\u2019s Protothetic,\nespecially in its \u201cofficial\u201d versions, must appear very\ncumbersome and difficult to understand and work with. In part this is a\nquestion of the age of the systems and Le\u015bniewski\u2019s aversion\nto semantics (see above). However, Le\u015bniewski did not\nalways present his work so fiercely. For purposes of everyday\nderivation he employed what can only be described as a system of\nnatural deduction, making assumptions, following their consequences,\ncollecting them and inferring conditionals and biconditionals, in the\nmanner to which all students of logic have since become accustomed.\nAstonishingly, neither he nor any of his students thought fit to codify\nthese practices into a system of rules. This was done instead at\n\u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s suggestion by Stanis\u0142aw Ja\u015bkowski.\nThe discovery of natural deduction is generally attributed to others,\nbut there is a chance that Le\u015bniewski used it, in a recognizably\nmodern form, earlier than others. That he did not codify it probably\nresulted from his viewing it as a pedagogical device and a way of\nsketching out how a \u201cproper\u201d (i.e. axiomatic) proof was to\ngo. Another way to take some of the forbidding appearance out of\nProtothetic is to look for more readily comprehensible axioms. The\nfollowing two-axiom set based on implication as the primitive (an\nalternative Le\u015bniewski also looked at) is rather straightforward;\nthe result was again obtained by Tarski:\n\n\\[\\tag{P3}\n\\forall pq\\ulcorner p \\rightarrow(q \\rightarrow p)\\urcorner\n\\]\n\n\\[\\tag{P4}\n\\forall pqrf \\ulcorner f (rp) \\rightarrow \n(f (r (p \\rightarrow \\forall s\\ulcorner\\rs\\urcorner) ) \\rightarrow f (rq) )\n\\urcorner\n\\]\n\n\n \nThe first is the universal closure of a standard axiom of\npropositional calculus going back to Frege. Recalling that F(alse) can\nbe defined as \\(\\forall s\\ulcorner s\\urcorner\\) and negation as\n\\(p \\rightarrow\\) F, the second is the universal closure of\n\n\\[\nf (rp) \\rightarrow(f (r {\\sim}p) \\rightarrow f (rq))\n\\]\n\n\n \nwhich simply says that if \\(f (r\\) any truth-value) then\n\\(f(rq)\\) for arbitrary \\(q\\), and that it\nobviously correct. It can be (tediously) checked that the result is\nvalid for all sixteen extensional binary truth-functions substitutable\nfor \u2018\\(f\\) \u2019. Dragging the whole of Protothetic out\nof these simple beginnings is obviously much harder, and depends on\ncoming up with suitable definitions for the connectives.\n\n In Ontology, Le\u015bniewski and his students, particularly\nSoboci\u0144ski, worked on replacing the 1920 \u201clong\u201d\nsingle axiom by a shorter one, eventually arriving at the\nunshortenable\n\n\\[\\tag{OS}\n\\forall Aa\\ulcorner A \\isa a \\leftrightarrow \\exists B \\ulcorner A \\isa B \\wedge B \\isa a\\urcorner \\urcorner\n\\]\n\n\n \nThis axiom gives a much less obvious insight into the intended\nmeaning of \u2018\\(\\isa\\)\u2019 than the original 1920 axiom. For a\ndelicately balanced combination of brevity with clarity the following\nequivalent two-axiom set is perspicuous:\n\n\\[\\tag{OS1}\n\\forall Ab\\ulcorner A \\isa b \\rightarrow A \\isa A\\urcorner\n\\]\n\n\\[\\tag{OS2}\n\\forall ABc \\ulcorner(A \\isa B \\wedge B \\isa c) \\rightarrow A \\isa c\\urcorner\n\\]\n\n\n \nwhere notably the first axiom is precisely the one that\nLe\u015bniewski mentioned to Twardowski in 1919.\n\n Although Ontology is perhaps the most generally interesting of\nLe\u015bniewski\u2019s systems, it was known during his lifetime less\nthrough his own published work, which was confined to a short,\ntechnical and inaccessible memoir, but through a gentle and\nsympathetic exposition in Kotarbi\u0144ski\u2019s 1929 widely read and\ninfluential Warsaw textbook known simply as the\nElementy. Kotarbi\u0144ski explains how he had no need to\ncome up with a logical system of names and predicates, since he could\nget one ready-made from a firm with an excellent\nreputation. Le\u015bniewski was duly grateful for the plug.\n\n The fact that the basic sentence-module in Ontology is singular\ninclusion of the form \u2018\\(A \\isa b\\)\u2019\nhas misled some commentators into thinking that Le\u015bniewski turned\nhis back on the Fregean notion of predication as functional\napplication and instead reverted to a medieval \u201ctwo-name\u201d\naccount of predication. Indeed, except for the matter of tense,\nLe\u015bniewski\u2019s account of the truth-conditions of such singular\nsentences\u2014that they are true if and only if the subject term\ndenotes a single object and the predicate term denotes one or more\nobjects of which this is one\u2014is almost exactly the same as that\ngiven by the medieval nominalist William of Ockham. However, whether\nor not Ockham was a two-name theorist, Le\u015bniewski definitely was\nnot. The general form of the singular sentence is the same as that of\nany binary predication, \\(f(ab)\\), or in\nLe\u015bniewski\u2019s notation, \\(f\\{ab\\}\\). Singular\ninclusion is no syncategorematic copula: it is a special binary\npredicate. That it is chosen as the primitive is understandable but\nnot compulsory. Le\u015bniewski knew that other predicates than\n\u2018\\(\\isa\\)\u2019 could be taken as primitive, a fact emphasized\nlater by Lejewski.\n\n It was in Mereology, Le\u015bniewski\u2019s oldest system, that there were\nthe most varied developments. The 1927\u201330 article series on\nMereology as part of the foundations of mathematics rang the changes\nin possible primitives. After scathing attacks on Whitehead\u2019s and\nRussell\u2019s use/mention confusions in Principia, and on\nstandard set theories, he retraces the formal development of his 1916\npaper, noting in a long footnote the similarities with Whitehead\u2019s\ntheory of events, whose formal development he also criticises. He\nthen summarizes the development up to 1920, continuing with additional\nresults unpublished in 1916, taking the number of theorems up to\n198. Further chapters tidy up the axiomatization in terms of\n\u2018part\u2019, and show that \u2018ingredient\u2019 can be\ntaken as primitive. The theorems are taken up to 264, then\n\u2018exterior\u2019 is shown to be a possible primitive. There the\ndevelopment is arrested, and a final section discusses singular\npropositions of the form \u2018\\(A \\isa b\\)\u2019, with a note on how to understand propositions about\na thing which changes. Using the example \u2018Warsaw of 1830 is\nsmaller than Warsaw of 1930\u2019, Le\u015bniewski proposes to\nconsider \u2018Warsaw in 1830\u2019 and \u2018Warsaw in 1930\u2019\nas denoting time-slices of the temporally much longer object he calls\n\u2018Warsaw from the beginning to the end of its\nexistence\u2019. In this way he claims to bring many uses of\n\u2018is\u2019 in ordinary language within the scope of an analysis\nusing his Ontology. This four-dimensional understanding of ordinary\nobjects is now commonplace, but at that time it was something of a\nrarity. The discussion is one of the few places in Le\u015bniewski\u2019s\nmature work where he indulges in anything similar to the philosophical\nlogic of his early years. Otherwise, when not discussing formal\nsystems and proving theorems, his prose discussions tend to be\nintemperate though frequently justified criticisms of the statements\nof others, most especially the proponents of standard set theory.\n6. Personality and Legacy\n6.1 Le\u015bniewski as a Person\n\n \nNormally the character of an academic is of marginal relevance to his\nor her work. In the case of Le\u015bniewski there is reason to think\notherwise. The extreme rigor that he applied in logic, the\nunflinchingly high standards he set himself and others, his blank\nincomprehension of intellectual, formal and linguistic inexactness,\nand his willingness to let academic disagreement sour his\nrelationships with colleagues, all speak of an unusual rigidity. This\nseems to have been deeply anchored: of his school days we know little\nother than that he was intolerant of exceptions to any rule, whether\nor not the rule was sensible. After one of his early Polish essays was\ntypeset with a spelling mistake in the title\n(\u2018\u015brodku\u2019 instead of \u2018\u015brodka\u2019), he\nalways quoted the incorrect title, because to correct it would have\nbeen to break the rule that quotation must be literal and exact. In\nhis early years he nursed the project of translating Anton Marty\u2019s\nrambling and polemical 1908 treatise Untersuchungen zur\nGrundlegung der allgemeinen Grammatik und Sprachphilosophie\n[Investigations on the Founding of General Grammar and Philosophy\nof Language]. He never got beyond the second word of the title,\n\u2018zur\u2019, which is admittedly not easily captured in all its\nnuances\u2014it can mean \u2018toward\u2019 as well as\n\u2018on\u2019 or \u2018about\u2019. Having carried a copy of the\nbook around for some time and asked all his friends and colleagues how\nthey would translate \u2018zur\u2019, he gave up. No doubt his\ninterests shifted, but the incident demonstrates both his\npunctiliousness and his inflexibility.\n\nBiographical material about Le\u015bniewski is fairly sparse, and it\nis even harder to gain a clear idea of what he was like as a person. Jadacki (2016) contains much new information about Le\u015bniewski, his family, and his relationships with colleagues and contemporaries, but even here the man behind the words and (invariably unsmiling) photographs is not easily discernible.\nA photograph of him in Twardowski\u2019s seminar in 1913 shows a short,\ndapper man with a goatee and a flamboyant neckscarf, as described by\n\u0141ukasiewicz. In later photographs from the same period he lacks the\ngoatee but retains a moustache. Two well-known later photos show a\nstiffly-posed, stocky, clean-shaven man in a business suit with the\nslicked-back hair of the period, looking more like a bank manager than\na professor of logic, except for an intense stare. Le\u015bniewski was\nknown to be a fierce critic of what he considered unclear, which was\npretty well everything. His stock complaint was that he could not\nunderstand what speakers were saying, or writers were writing. In the\nlight of his pathological inability to see beyond the literal meaning\non the page to any intended but inaccurately expressed meaning this is\nunsurprising, but also unendearing. In the early 1920s Marjan\nBorowski, the editor of\nPrzegl\u0105d Filozoficzny, complained to Twardowski that\npeople were afraid to submit papers or give talks in Warsaw because\nthey were fearful of being criticised by Le\u015bniewski, though he\nadded with some glee that the scourge of God had risen up against him\nin the shape of one Tajtelbaum \u2013 the young Tarski. Even the\nphlegmatic Twardowski found his former student irritating: in a diary\nentry for 12 August 1930 he complains, \u201cIn general those who\nbehave according to Lesniewski\u2019s model ask very arbitrarily for\nanalysis where it is convenient to them\u2014if, however, one of them\nasks for analysis where it is not convenient to him, they turn to\nintuition. And if the opposer in the discussion sometimes tries to\nturn to intuition, they reply \u2018We don\u2019t understand what\nyou consider to be intuitively given\u2019.\u201d Twardowski\u2019s 1921\npaper \u2018Symbolomania and Pragmatophobia\u2019 is a plea for\nphilosophers not to put symbols above things, and while its ostensible target is the French physicist Henri Bouasse, it is clearly implicitly directed\nagainst \u0141ukasiewicz and Le\u015bniewski and their students.\n\n Le\u015bniewski was however not lacking in a certain heavy humor.\nLejewski reported that he once mocked a Warsaw Professor of Classics\nfor wearing sunglasses (then rather rare): \u201cIs the world too dazzling for\nhim?\u201d He was equably resigned to his lectures being sparsely\nattended because of their extreme technicality. One semester,\nunexpectedly many students turned up at the first lecture. He looked\naround the room in surprise and asked \u201cWhat are you all doing\nhere? I am not Bergson.\u201d For those who were just there for the\nsake of doing a course and clocking up their attendance he quietly\nsigned off their lecture books straight away, and told them not to\nworry about coming again. The few die-hards came for the sake of the\nlogic. Le\u015bniewski would enter the lecture room with a briefcase\nstuffed with papers, root around, find where he had got to and\ncarry on, writing formulas and explaining how they were derived. When\nQuine visited some of these lectures, he was able to follow them\ndespite knowing no Polish.\n Le\u015bniewski married in 1913: his wife Zofia Prewysz-Kwinto\ncame of a landed family from Kimborciszki (Kimbarti\u0161k\u0117) in rural\nLithuania. They had no children. Before World War I Le\u015bniewski\nseems to have had the means to travel around to different German\ncities to study, and to spend time after his doctorate in Paris, San\nRemo and St. Petersburg.\n\n Le\u015bniewski inspired devotion in a very small coterie of students,\na few of whom stayed fiercely loyal, but sooner or later he ended up\nalienating nearly everyone, either through his robust professional\nopinions, or his manner, or his political views. He started out as a\nradical socialist\u2014his decision to spend the war in Russia was\npartly personal and partly political\u2014but after the excesses of\nthe October Revolution and its aftermath he rejected socialism. From\nthe 1920s he supported the authoritarianism of J\u00f3zef\nPi\u0142sudski, but from about 1930 his views took on a darker\nanti-Semitic tinge. An unsavory letter written to Twardowski in 1935\ncomplains of \u201cfilthy tricks\u201d being played on him \u201cby\ncertain Jew-boys or their foreign friends\u201d, declares a personal\nantipathy to Tarski, whose career he would not obstruct, but admits he\n\u201cwould be extraordinarily pleased if some day I were to read in\nthe newspapers that he was being offered a full professorship, for\nexample in Jerusalem, from where he could send us offprints of his\nvaluable works to our great profit.\u201d Tarski had been passed over\nfor the chair in Lw\u00f3w, which went to Chwistek on the strength of\npraise from Russell, even though the Varsovians, including\nLe\u015bniewski, had supported Tarski. Tarski certainly felt aggrieved\nand no doubt suspected anti-Semitic motives, but like Le\u015bniewski\nhe was prickly and sensitive about matters of priority. It is in\nretrospect mildly grotesque to see how carefully Le\u015bniewski and\nTarski dance around each other in their prefaces and acknowledgements,\nneither wishing to give public offence to the other. Despite their\ndisagreements and suspicions however, they long continued to meet once a week,\nwith no one else present, to discuss logic.\n\n Le\u015bniewski\u2019s antipathy towards set theory was so vehement and\nhis criticisms so intemperate that it led to a break in relations with\nhis set-theoretically minded mathematical colleagues Sierpi\u0144ski\nand Kuratowski; he resigned from the editorial board of Fundamenta\nMathematicae, with the result that he was no longer able to\npublish his own work there. By the end of his life, Le\u015bniewski\u2019s\nonly surviving close friend was the saintly patient and faithful\nKotarbi\u0144ski, who alone of his colleagues visited him in hospital\nin his last illness. They had been born just days apart in\n1886. The cancer that killed Le\u015bniewski was no doubt exacerbated\nby smoking: cigars and a large pipe. During the operation he was\nconscious and without anaesthetic because of the dangers and he was\nallowed to smoke even then to distract himself from the pain. But he\ndid not recover, and died sitting in his favourite armchair, brought\nspecially into the hospital.\n6.2 Le\u015bniewski\u2019s Legacy\n\n \nOf the students that Le\u015bniewski had taught at Warsaw, some went\non to logical and philosophical careers of their own, most notably\nTarski, whom Le\u015bniewski correctly recognized as a genius, and who\nwent on to outshine his teacher. Among those who stayed fairly close\nto Le\u015bniewski\u2019s own views were Jerzy S\u0142upecki, Boles\u0142aw\nSoboci\u0144ski, Czes\u0142aw Lejewski, and Henry Hi\u017c. The first\nthree in particular contributed after World War II to the\nreconstruction of many of the logical results that had been lost in\n1944. Serendipitously recovered students\u2019 notes from\nLe\u015bniewski\u2019s lectures, translated and published in 1988, give\nsome idea of the detail of Le\u015bniewski\u2019s teaching, but his\nlectures ranged more widely than the extant works show. At all times\nhowever, Le\u015bniewski\u2019s logical position was a minority one, which\nwas respected while being rejected, and it won few converts after his\ndeath. The reasons for his sidelining have been analysed by\nGrzegorczyk (1955). Le\u015bniewski\u2019s work was developed in the 1920s\nwhen an axiomatic approach was standard, as in Hilbert\u2019s school, but\nhis negative attitude to semantics as a separable part of logic meant\nhe was unsympathetic to the shift towards a semantic approach\ninitiated by Tarski, and he would have remained opposed even had he\nlived longer. His vituperative rejection of set theory made him no\nfriends and many enemies among mathematicians, while his unwillingness\nand inability to find anything worthwhile in the works of philosophers\nlost him their sympathy. His obsessive concern for the minute detail\nof axiomatizations was unattractive to many when more streamlined\nmethods were available, and his radical nominalism made the\npresentation of logic according to his principles a matter of extreme\ninconvenience. Even Tarski, who was initially very much a follower,\nhad to admit that Le\u015bniewski\u2019s conception of logical systems as\nconcrete collections of inscriptions growing in time through the\naddition of new theses made them \u201cthoroughly unrewarding objects\nfor methodological and semantic research\u201d.\n\n In retrospect we can see Le\u015bniewski\u2019s obsession with the\nfine detail of axiomatics and his rejection of semantics as conditioned\nby his own idiosyncratic development and the predominant research\ninterests of the 1910s and 1920s. It is in fact possible to apply more\nstandard metalogical considerations to his systems, such as\ninvestigating them for consistency and completeness. However, the\ndifficulties and complications of working within the confines of a\nfully nominalistic attitude\u2014sans sets, sans\nabstract expression types\u2014have put off all but a very few, and\nthe relative ease with which results can be obtained when fewer\nontological scruples are in play makes Le\u015bniewski\u2019s systems\nand others like them interesting mainly to certain philosophers, while\nmathematicians and mathematical logicians have by-passed them.\n\n On the other hand, Le\u015bniewski\u2019s concerns for the proprieties\nof quotation and use/mention, the object-language/metalanguage\ndistinction, canons of correct definition, and his development of\nMereology as the dominant formal theory of part and whole have all\npassed into the mainstream, and the logical expertise he helped to\ninstil into a generation of Poles contributed in large part to making\nWarsaw the premier interbellum location for mathematical logic. In the\nentrance to the 1999 University of Warsaw Library building stand four\nconcrete pillars and sculptures by Adam Myjak, celebrating the\nphilosophical achievements of Poland. The figures represented are\nLe\u015bniewski\u2019s teacher Twardowski, his colleague\n\u0141ukasiewicz, his student Tarski, and Le\u015bniewski himself.",
