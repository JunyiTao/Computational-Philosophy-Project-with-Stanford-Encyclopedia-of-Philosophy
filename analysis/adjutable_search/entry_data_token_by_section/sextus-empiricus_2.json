    "main_text": "Works || Lost Works\n2.2 Lost Works\n\n\nThe ancients do not refer to their books using titles in the way we\ndo. Often, Sextus refers to the books we know as PH or\nM using other descriptions. For instance, at M VI 52\nhe says: \n \nthat sound is non-existent has been proved by us in our\nskeptical commentaries (en tois skeptikois\nhypomn\u00eamatois), from the evidence of the Dogmatists,\n \nwhich is pretty clearly a reference to M VIII 131, and at\nM VI 61 he says:\n \nthat time is nothing we have already\nestablished in our Pyrrhonian writings (en tois\nPyrrh\u00f4neiois)\u2019,\n \nwhich is either a reference to\nPH III 136\u201350 or M X 169\u2013247 (Brochard 1887: 319\u201320).\nMost of Sextus\u2019 references to his own works can be explained this\nway. However, a couple of times Sextus refers to his writings in ways\nwhich suggest that there are some treatises we no longer have (in\naddition to the part of M corresponding to PH I):\n\nM VII 202: \u2018medical commentaries\u2019\n(\u1f30\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u1f70 \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03bc\u03bd\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1); presumably\nthe same as M I 61: \u2018empiric commentaries\u2019\n(\u1f10\u03bc\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u1f70 \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03bc\u03bd\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1);\nM VI 55, \u2018the commentaries on the soul\u2019,\nand X 284 \u2018in the writings on the soul\u2019.\n\n",
