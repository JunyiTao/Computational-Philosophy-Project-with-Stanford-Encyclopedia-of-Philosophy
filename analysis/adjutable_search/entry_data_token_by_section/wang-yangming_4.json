    "main_text": "Metaphysics\n5. Metaphysics\nWang was not primarily interested in theoretical issues.  However,\nsome of his comments suggest a subtle metaphysical view that supports\nhis conception of ethics.  This metaphysics is phrased in terms of the\nPattern/qi framework (see Section 2, above), and also makes\nuse of the Substance/Function distinction.  Substance\n(t\u01d0), literally body, is an entity in itself, while\nFunction is its characteristic or appropriate activity or\nmanifestation: a lamp is Substance, its light is function; an eye is\nSubstance, seeing is its Function; water is Substance, waves are its\nFunction.  The Substance/Function distinction goes back to the Daoists\nof the Han dynasty (202 BCE\u2013220 CE) and became central among\nChinese Buddhists before being picked up by Neo\u2013Confucians.\nPart of the attraction of this vocabulary is that it gives\nphilosophers drawn to a sort of monism the ability to distinguish\nbetween two aspects of what they regard as ultimately a unity.  \nWang argues that the human mind is identical with the Pattern of\nthe universe, and as such it forms \u201cone body\u201d\n(y\u00ec t\u01d0, one Substance) with \u201cHeaven, Earth,\nand the myriad creatures\u201d of the world.  The difference between\nthe virtuous and the vicious is that the former recognize that their\nminds form one body with everything else, while the latter,\n\u201cbecause of the space between their own physical form and those\nof others, regard themselves as separate\u201d (Tiwald and Van Norden\n2014, 241).  As evidence for the claim that the minds of all humans\nform one body with the rest of the universe, Wang appeals to a thought\nexperiment first formulated by Mencius: \u201cwhen they see a child\n[about to] fall into a well, [humans] cannot avoid having a mind of\nalarm and compassion for the child\u201d (Tiwald and Van Norden 2014,\n241\u2013242; Mengzi 2A6).  Wang then anticipates a series\nof objections, and offers further thought experiments to motivate the\nconclusion that only some underlying metaphysical identity between\nhumans and other things can account for the broad range of our\nreactions to them:\n\nSomeone might object that this response is because the child belongs\nto the same species.  But when they hear the anguished cries or see\nthe frightened appearance of birds or beasts, they cannot avoid a\nsense of being unable to bear it. \u2026 Someone might object that\nthis response is because birds and beasts are sentient creatures.  But\nwhen they see grass or trees uprooted and torn apart, they cannot\navoid feeling a sense of sympathy and distress. \u2026 Someone might\nobject that this response is because grass and trees have life and\nvitality.  But when they see tiles and stones broken and destroyed,\nthey cannot avoid feeling a sense of concern and regret. \u2026 This\nshows that the benevolence that forms one body [with Heaven, Earth,\nand the myriad creatures] is something that even the minds of petty\npeople possess. (Tiwald and Van Norden 2014, 242)\n\nWang\u2019s first three thought experiments seem fairly compelling at\nfirst glance.  Almost all humans would, at least as a first instinct,\nhave \u201calarm and compassion\u201d if suddenly confronted with\nthe sight of a child about to fall into a well. In addition, humans\noften do show pity for the suffering of non\u2013human animals.\nFinally, the fact that humans maintain public parks and personal\ngardens shows some kind of concern for plants.  \nIt is not a decisive objection to Wang\u2019s view that humans often\nfail to manifest benevolence to other humans, non\u2013human animals,\nor plants.  Wang is arguing that all humans manifest these responses\nsometimes (and that this is best explained by his favored\nmetaphysics).  Like all Neo\u2013Confucians, Wang readily\nacknowledges that selfish desires frequently block the manifestation\nof our shared nature.  However, there are three lines of objection to\nWang\u2019s view that are harder to dismiss.  (1) There is considerable\nempirical evidence that some humans never manifest any\ncompassion for the suffering of others.  In the technical literature\nof psychology, these people are a subset of those identified as having\n\u201cAntisocial Personality Disorder\u201d as defined in\n DSM\u2013V.[10]\n (2) Wang asserts that when humans \u201csee tiles and stones broken\nand destroyed, they cannot avoid feeling a sense of concern and\nregret.\u201d This claim is important for Wang\u2019s argument, because he\ntakes this reaction to be evidence for the conclusion that our minds\nare ultimately \u201cone Substance\u201d with everything in\nthe universe, not merely with members of our species, or other\nsentient creatures, or other living things.  We can perhaps motivate\nWang\u2019s intuition by considering how we might react if we saw that\nsomeone had spray painted graffiti on Half Dome in Yosemite National\nPark.  The defacement of this scenic beauty would probably provoke\nsadness in those of us with an eye for natural beauty.  However, it is\ncertainly not obvious that everyone manifests even sporadic concern\nfor \u201ctiles and stones,\u201d which is what he needs for his\nconclusion. (3) Even if we grant Wang his intuitions, it is not clear\nthat the particular metaphysics he appeals to is the best explanation\nof those intuitions.  As Darwin himself suggested, our compassion for\nother humans can be explained in evolutionary terms.  In addition, the\n\u201cbiophilia hypothesis\u201d (Wilson [1984]) provides an\nevolutionary explanation for the human fondness for other animals and\nplants.  There is not an obvious evolutionary explanation for why\nhumans seem engaged by non\u2013living natural beauty, like mountain\npeaks, but as we have seen it seems questionable how common this trait\nis.\n",
