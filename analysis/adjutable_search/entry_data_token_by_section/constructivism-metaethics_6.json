    "main_text": "Aristotelian Constructivism\n4. Aristotelian Constructivism\n\nAristotelian constructivism is a metaethical view about the nature of\nnormative truths, according to which our true normative judgments\nrepresent a normative reality, but this reality is not independent of\nthe exercise of moral and practical judgment (LeBar 2008: 182;\n2013a,b). Like the Kantian varieties of constructivism, Aristotelian\nconstructivism appeals to constitutive features of practical reason:\n\n\n\npractical truth is constructed, not discovered, because it is activity\nin accordance with the norms of practical rationality, which are\nthemselves constitutive of agency. (LeBar 2008: 191) \n\n\nTo this extent, this metaethical view shares the ambitions of Kantian\nconstructivism to ground normative truths in features of rational\nagency. In contrast to Kantian models, however, Aristotelians hold\nthat the principles of sound practical reason are neither formal nor\nprocedural. Rather, they are grounded in a substantive account of the\ngood life, which is inspired by ancient eudaimonism. The wise and\nvirtuous agents form the standard of practical rationality through the\nexercise of their virtues of intellect and character (Aristotle\nNicomachean Ethics, II.6.\n\nThe negative case for Aristotelian constructivism consists in the\ncritique of the Kantian account of practical reasoning, its form,\nreach, and powers. Under attack is the claim that practical reasoning\nis law-like, i.e., governed by the requirement of universality.\nAccording to some critics, Kantians have a difficult time explaining\nhow to apply universal rational principles to concrete cases\n(H\u00f6ffe 1993; LeBar 2013b; Millgram 2005: chapter 6). In this\nrespect, the Aristotelians claim to have a significant advantage\nbecause Aristotelian constructivism allows practical reasoning to\nadapt to particular cases. Aristotelian constructivism works out a\nstory about the norms for success in judgment, which is considered a\nproblem for Kant and an unrecognized lacuna in contemporary Kantian\nethics (Millgram 2005: chapter 6). Because of its appeal to moral\nlaws, Kantian ethics is often criticized either for entailing rigorism\nor for empty formalism. In either case, Kantian ethics seems incapable\nof accounting for the relevance of circumstances for ethical\njudgments. This is a problem that Kantian constructivists address\n(O\u2019Neill 1975; Herman 1993), but inadequately, according to the\nAristotelians (LeBar 2013b.\n\nTo identify the substantive standards of practical reasoning,\nAristotelian constructivism starts with a study of the complexity of\nour rational animal nature, which excludes that the principles\nconstitutive of human rationality can be merely formal. In contrast to\nKantian self-legislation, Aristotelian constructivism emphasizes the\ninterplay between rational and animal nature, focusing especially on\ntraining and shaping the affective and sensitive aspects of our\nnature. In particular, it emphasizes the transformative effects of\nreflection on passions and desires, and the possibility of developing\na \u2018second nature\u2019, thanks to complex processes such as\nhabituation and education (LeBar 2008: 197). The key feature of this\naccount is the claim that practical rationality does not merely direct\nour affective responses toward adequate objects but also structurally\ntransforms our animal sensibility into character. The relevant norms\nand their applications to practical reasoning are the work of\npractical wisdom (phronesis), in conjunction with the\nexcellences of character, as Aristotle suggests (LeBar 2013a).\n",
