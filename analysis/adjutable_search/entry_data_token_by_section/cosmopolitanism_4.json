    "main_text": "Objections to Cosmopolitanism\n3. Objections to Cosmopolitanism\n\n\nOne of the most common objections to cosmopolitanism attacks a position\nthat is in fact made of straw. Often it is said that cosmopolitanism is\nmeaningless without the context of a world\u2013state or that\ncosmopolitanism necessarily involves the commitment to a world state.\nThese claims are historically uninformed, because cosmopolitanism as a\nconcept arose in the first instance as a metaphor for a way of life and\nnot in literal guise. Ever since, there have been cosmopolitans who do\nnot touch on the issue of international political organization, and of\nthose who do, very few defend the ideal of a world\u2013state. Furthermore,\neven those cosmopolitans who do favor a world-state tend to support\nsomething more sophisticated that cannot be dismissed out of hand, such as a\nthin conception of world government with layered sovereignty. \nAnother common objection to cosmopolitanism associates it with imperialism, colonialism, and paternalism. Some cosmopolitans, despite taking themselves to be opposed to imperialism, colonialism, and paternalism, are charged with focusing too narrowly on the responsibilities (and perspectives) of the affluent while conceiving of those living in poverty mainly as the passive recipients of their \u201caid.\u201d Such focus indeed shows little sensitivity to questions of epistemic justice and to the wide range of perspectives that merit being taken seriously (Flikschuh 2017). These charges are often internal to cosmopolitanism, however, as they do not so much call into question the cosmopolitan ideal itself as reject certain limited instantiations of it. Cosmopolitans can and do examine the entitlements of those living in poverty (Caney 2015) and argue in favor of poor-led social movements (Deveaux 2018) and alternative forms of cosmopolitanism \u201cfrom below\u201d (Bailey 2017). Others point to the relevance, for cosmopolitan theorizing, of poverty-driven labor migration and migrant activism as acts of world citizenship (Caraus and Paris 2018).\n\n\nThere are, however, serious and philosophically interesting challenges to\ncosmopolitanism itself, and they come in two main forms. The first calls into question\nthe possibility of realizing the cosmopolitan ideal, while the second\nqueries its desirability. We discuss these two challenges to the\ndifferent forms of cosmopolitanism in turn.\n",
