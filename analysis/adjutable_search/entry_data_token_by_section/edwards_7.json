    "main_text": "Epistemology\n4. Epistemology\n4.1 A Sense of the Heart\n\nBecause their hearts have been regenerated by the indwelling of the\nHoly Spirit, the saints love being in general. Their love is the basis\nof a new \u201cspiritual sense\u201d whose \u201cimmediate\nobject\u201d is \u201cthe beauty of holiness\u201d \u2014 a\n\u201cnew simple idea\u201d that can't \u201cbe produced by\nexalting, varying or compounding\u201d ideas \u201cwhich they had\nbefore,\u201d and that truly \u201crepresents\u201d divine reality\n(Religious Affections, 1746 and True Virtue, 1765;\nEdwards 1957\u2013, vol. 2, 205, 260, and vol. 8, 622).\n\nEdwards sometimes identifies true beauty with the pleasure that holy\nthings evoke in people with spiritual \u201cframes\u201d or\n\u201ctempers\u201d or with the tendency they have to evoke it. At\nother times he identifies it with the consent of being to being, i.e.,\nwith true benevolence or holiness. His view appears to be this. True\nbeauty is identical with benevolence or agreement in somewhat the same\nway in which water is identical with H2O or heat with\nmolecular motion. But benevolence is also the objective basis of a\ndispositional property, namely, a tendency to produce a new simple\nidea in the savingly converted. This idea is a delight or pleasure in\nbeing's consent to being which somehow \u201crepresents\u201d or is\na \u201cperception\u201d of it. Edwards' account of true beauty thus\nresembles some accounts of color or extension. Spiritual delight is a\nsimple idea or sensation like our ideas of color or extension. The\ndispositional property is a power objects have to produce these ideas\nin our understandings. Benevolence is the objective configuration\nunderlying this power and corresponds to the microstructure of bodies\nthat underlie their tendency to excite ideas of color or extension in\nminds like ours. Like simple ideas of redness, say, or extension, the\nnew spiritual sensation \u201crepresents\u201d or is a\n\u201cperception\u201d of its object. Just as \u2018red\u2019 or\n\u2018extension\u2019 can refer to the idea, the power, or the\nphysical configuration that is the basis of the power, so \u201ctrue\nbeauty\u201d can refer to the spiritual sensation, to the relevant\ndispositional property, or to benevolence.\n\nEdwards calls the new mode of spiritual understanding a\n\u201csense\u201d because the apprehension of spiritual beauty is\n(1) non-inferential and (2) involuntary, and Edwards, like Hutcheson,\nassociates sensation with immediacy and passivity. (3) It also\ninvolves relish or delight, and Edwards followed Locke and Hutcheson\nin thinking that, like a feeling of tactual pressure or an impression\nof redness, being pleased or pained is a kind of sensation or\nperception. Finally, (4) the new mode of understanding is the source\nof a new simple idea, and Edwards shared Locke's and Hutcheson's\nconviction that simple ideas come \u201cfrom experience.\u201d\n\nThe saints alone are in an epistemic position to discern truths of\nreligion that are dependent on the \u201cexcellency of divine\nthings\u201d. For example, a conviction of Christ's sufficiency as a\nmediator depends on an apprehension of his beauty and excellency. Or,\nagain, one must see the beauty of holiness to appreciate the\n\u201chatefulness of sin,\u201d and thus be convinced of the justice\nof divine punishment and our inability to make restitution. The new\nsense also helps us grasp the truth of the gospel scheme as a whole. A\nconviction of its truth is an immediate inference from a perception of\nthe beauty or splendor of what it depicts, namely, \u201cGod and\nJesus Christ\u2026the work of redemption, and the ways and works of\nGod\u201d (A Divine and Supernatural Light, 1734; Edwards\n1957\u2013, vol. 17, 413).\n\nEdwards' defense of the objectivity of the new spiritual sense has\nfour steps. (1) Benevolence agrees with the nature of things. The\nworld is an interconnected system of minds and ideas in which the only\ntrue substance and cause is an infinite and omnipotent love. Human\nbenevolence is thus an appropriate or fitting response to reality. (2)\nBenevolence is pleased by benevolence; it relishes it, or delights in\nit, for its own sake. Since benevolence is an appropriate response to\nreality, so too is benevolence's delight in benevolence. (3) But a\ndelight in benevolence just is a perception of its spiritual beauty.\nIt follows that (4) the redeemed's spiritual perceptions are veridical\n\u2014 \u201crepresentations\u201d of something \u201cbesides what\n[is] in [their] own minds\u201d (True Virtue, 1765; Edwards\n1957\u2013, vol. 8, 622).\n\nThere is also an implicit theological defense of the spiritual sense's\nobjectivity. \u201cTrue saving grace is no other than the very love\nof God; that is, God in one of the persons of the Trinity, uniting\nhimself to the soul of the creature as a vital principle, dwelling\nthere and exerting himself by the faculties of the soul of man in his\nown proper nature after the manner of a principle of nature.\u201d\nThe saints are thus \u201cnot only partakers of a nature that may in\nsome sense be called divine because \u2018tis conformed to the nature\nof God; but the very Deity does in some sense dwell in them\u201d\n(Treatise on Grace,; Edwards 1957\u2013, vol. 21, 194).\n(There were Puritan precedents for these claims.)\n\nEdwards is making two claims. First, the new spiritual disposition and\ntastes which God bestows on the soul are divine. The differences\nbetween God's love and joy and the love and joy that he bestows on his\nsaints is a difference of degree, not of nature or kind. Second, God\ndoes not act on the soul from without, but dwells within it \u201cas\na principle of a [new] nature,\u201d living, acting, and exerting\nhimself in the exercise of the soul's faculties. The\n\u201cmechanism\u201d underlying the new spiritual sense thus\nultimately turns out to be God himself. Hence, since God in some sense\nis reality or being itself, it follows that the spiritual\nsense is necessarily aligned with reality.\n4.2 Sanctified Reason\n\nEdwards thinks that reason can prove that God exists, establish many\nof his attributes, discern our obligations to him, and mount a\nprobable case for the credibility of scripture. But he also believes\nthat grace is needed both to help the natural principles\n\u201cagainst those things that tend to stupefy [them] and to hinder\n[their] free exercise,\u201d and to sanctify \u201cthe reasoning\nfaculty and\u201d assist \u201cit to see the clear evidence there is\nof the truth of religion in rational arguments\u201d\n(\u201cMiscellanies,\u201d nos. 626, 628; Edwards 1957\u2013, vol.\n18, 155, 156f).\n\nHis view is briefly this. \u201cActual ideas\u201d are ideas that\nare lively, clear, and distinct. Thought has a tendency to substitute\n\u201csigns\u201d (i. e., words or images) for actual ideas. While\nthis tendency is useful and normally quite harmless, it impedes\nreasoning when \u201cwe are at a loss concerning a connection or\nconsequence [between ideas], or have a new inference to draw, or would\nsee the force of some new argument\u201d (\u201cMiscellanies,\u201d\nno. 782; Edwards 1957\u2013, vol. 18, 457). Since accurate reasoning\nabout a subject matter requires attending to actual ideas of it, one\ncan't accurately reason about religion if one lacks the relevant actual\nideas. To have an actual idea of God, for example, one must have\nactual ideas of the ideas that compose it. But most of us don't. Those\nparts of the idea of God that everyone has (ideas of knowledge, power,\nand justice, for instance) either aren't attended to or, if they are,\nfail to elicit the appropriate affective reaction. In addition, we\ncan't fully understand ideas of affections which we haven't\nexperienced and so can't properly understand God's benevolence if we\naren't benevolent ourselves. And without the simple idea of true\nbeauty, one can understand neither God's holiness nor the facts that\ndepend on it.\n\nTrue benevolence remedies these deficiencies. Because the desires of\nthe truly benevolent are properly ordered, they attend to ideas of\nreligion and are suitably affected by the ideas of God's attributes\nand activities that everyone has. (They fear his wrath, for example,\nand are grateful for his benefits.) Furthermore, they understand God's\nbenevolence because their own benevolence mirrors it. Finally, the\ntruly benevolent delight in the benevolence in which holiness\nconsists, i.e., they \u201cperceive\u201d or \u201ctaste\u201d or\n\u201crelish\u201d its beauty. Edwards' claim, then, is that to\nreason accurately about God one must have an actual idea of him, and\nto have that one must be truly benevolent. Right reasoning about\nreligious matters requires right affections.\n\nEdwards is an evidentialist. Rational religious beliefs are either\nproperly basic or rest on good evidence. A belief that the gospel\nscheme exhibits true beauty is an example of the former. But most\nreligious beliefs depend on evidence. Sometimes this evidence includes\nthe idea of true beauty. Even when it does not, however, the right\naffections are needed to appreciate its force. In either case, only\nthose with properly disposed hearts can read the evidence\ncorrectly.\n5. The History of Redemption\n\nThe trustees of the College of New Jersey invited Edwards to become\nits third president in 1753. In his reply Edwards gave a number of\nreasons why he hesitated to accept their offer. Among these was the\nfear that doing so would interfere with the completion of \u201ca\ngreat work\u201d which he had long contemplated \u201cwhich I call a\nHistory of the Work of Redemption, a body of divinity in an\nentire new method, being thrown into the form of an history;\nconsidering the affair of Christian theology, as the whole of it, in\neach part, stands in reference to the great work of redemption by\nJesus Christ\u2026\u201d (Edwards 1957\u2013, vol. 16, 727f).\nAlthough Edwards' project was aborted by his untimely death, it would\nundoubtedly have been based on a sermon series delivered in 1739 which\ntraces the work of redemption \u201cfrom the fall of man to the end\nof the world.\u201d The proposed history would have been the\nculmination of the project begun in True Virtue and End\nof Creation. For creation and providence are subordinate to a\nredemption which is itself subordinate only to God's glory. The\nhistory of redemption is \u201cthe summum and\nultimum of all the divine operations and decrees,\u201d the\nmanifestation of God's internal glory in time (Edwards 1957\u2013,\nvol. 16, 728). Edwards' History would also have provided a\nfitting climax to his intellectual career as a whole. For it is in his\nwork of redemption that God's sovereignty, holiness, and splendor are\nmost fully displayed. \n\nIt is doubtful, however, that Edwards' work would have anticipated\nmodern historiography as some claim. For one thing, the sermon series\nis essentially a doctrinal work. (The section on Christ's\nearthly ministry, for instance, is a discussion of the incarnation and\natonement, not a life of Jesus.) For another, Edwards' sources include\nnot only biblical and \u201cprofane\u201d histories but biblical\nprophecy as well. Finally, Edwards doesn't restrict himself to natural\ncauses in explaining events but also appeals to divine decrees and\ntypology.\n\nWhatever novelty the sermon series possesses is literary and\ntheological. It partly consists in the rich skein of images Edwards\nuses to connect the events of redemption history. These include the\nmodel of a river and its tributaries, a tree and its branches, the\nconstruction of a building, the conduct of war, and \u201ca\nwheel,\u201d or \u201ca machine composed of wheels\u201d with its\nreminiscences both of Ezekiel's vision of the divine throne chariot\nand of clockwork (\u201cImages of Divine Things,\u201d no. 89;\nEdwards 1957\u2013, vol. 11, 86). It also consists in Edwards'\nextension of typology, the practice of interpreting things, persons,\nor events (the \u201ctype\u201d) as symbols or prefigurations of\nfuture realities (the \u201cantitype\u201d). Protestant divines had\ntended to restrict typology to figures, actions, and objects in the\nOld Testament which in their view shadowed forth Christ as their\nantitype. Edwards interprets the New Testament typologically as well,\narguing that relevant passages prefigure events in the church's later\nhistory. Most radically, Edwards construes nature typologically.\n(Whether this constitutes a step towards Emerson and Thoreau, as some\nclaim, is a moot point.) Finally, Edwards' emphasis on the objective\nside of God's act of redemption is comparatively rare in a Puritanism\nwhich tended to stress the redemption's application to individual\nsouls. (The subjective side is extensively treated in a number of\nworks of the 1730s and 1740s, however, the most important of which is\nReligious Affections.)",
