    "main_text": "Political Philosophy || The emergence of the general will: procedure, virtue and the legislator\n3.2 The emergence of the general will: procedure, virtue and the legislator\n\nIn The Social Contract Rousseau envisages three different\ntypes or levels of will as being in play. First, individuals all have\nprivate wills corresponding to their own selfish interests as natural\nindividuals; second, each individual, insofar as he identifies with\nthe collective as a whole and assumes the identity of citizen, wills\nthe general will of that collective as his or her own, setting aside\nselfish interest in favor of a set of laws that allow all to coexist\nunder conditions of equal freedom; third, and very problematically, a\nperson can identify with the corporate will of a subset of the\npopulace as a whole. The general will is therefore both a property of\nthe collective and a result of its deliberations, and a property of\nthe individual insofar as the individual identifies as a member of the\ncollective. In a well-ordered society, there is no tension between\nprivate and general will, as individuals accept that both justice and\ntheir individual self-interest require their submission to a law which\nsafeguards their freedom by protecting them from the private violence\nand personal domination that would otherwise hold sway. In practice,\nhowever, Rousseau believes that many societies will fail to have this\nwell-ordered character. One way in which they can fail is if private\nindividuals are insufficiently enlightened or virtuous and therefore\nrefuse to accept the restrictions on their own conduct which the\ncollective interest requires. Another mode of political failure arises\nwhere the political community is differentiated into factions (perhaps\nbased on a class division between rich and poor) and where one faction\ncan impose its collective will on the state as a whole.\n\nThe Social Contract harbors a further tension between two\naccounts of how the general will emerges and its relation to the\nprivate wills of citizens. Sometimes Rousseau favors a procedural\nstory according to which the individual contemplation of self interest\n(subject to the constraints of generality and universality and under\npropitious sociological background conditions such as rough equality\nand cultural similarity) will result in the emergence of the general\nwill from the assembly of citizens (see Sreenivasan 2000). In this\naccount of the emergence of the general will, there seems to be no\nspecial need for citizens to have any specifically moral qualities:\nthe constraints on their choice should be enough. However, Rousseau\nalso clearly believes that the mere contemplation of self interest\nwould be inadequate to generate a general will. This may partly\nconcern issues of compliance, since selfish citizens who can will the\ngeneral will might still not be moved to obey it. But Rousseau also\nseems to believe that citizen virtue is a necessary condition for the\nemergence of the general will in the first place. This presents him\nwith a problem for which his figure of the legislator is one supposed\nsolution. As a believer in the plasticity of human nature, Rousseau\nholds that good laws make for good citizens. However, he also believes\nboth that good laws can only be willed by good citizens and that, in\norder to be legitimate, they must be agreed upon by the assembly. This\nputs him in some difficulty, as it is unlikely that the citizens who\ncome together to form a new state will have the moral qualities\nrequired to will good laws, as those citizens will have been\npsychologically shaped by unjust institutions. The legislator\ntherefore has the function of inspiring a sense of collective identity\nin the new citizens that allows them to identify with the whole and be\nmoved to support legislation that will eventually transform them and\ntheir children into good citizens. In this story, however, the new\ncitizens at first lack the capacity to discern the good reasons that\nsupport the new laws and the lawgiver has to persuade them by\nnon-rational means to legislate in their own best interests.\n\nThe figure of the legislator is a puzzle. Like the tutor in\nEmile, the legislator has the role of manipulating the\ndesires of his charges, giving them the illusion of free choice\nwithout its substance. Little wonder then that many critics have seen\nthese characters in a somewhat sinister light. In both cases there is\na mystery concerning where the educator figure comes from and how he\ncould have acquired the knowledge and virtue necessary to perform his\nrole. This, in turn, raises a problem of regress. If the legislator\nwas formed by a just society, then who performed the\nlegislator\u2019s role for that society, and how was that legislator\nformed? How did the tutor acquire his education if not from a tutor\nwho, in turn, was educated according to Rousseau\u2019s program by an\nearlier tutor? At least in the case of the legislator, Rousseau might\npoint to some actual historical examples such as the Spartan,\nLycurgus, to argue that the idea is not entirely divorced from\nreality, but this seems a weak straw to clutch at.\n",
