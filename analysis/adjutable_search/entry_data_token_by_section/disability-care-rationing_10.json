    "main_text": "Disability as a systematic rationing consideration: ethical concerns || Health resource prioritization and the human right to health care\n3.4 Health resource prioritization and the human right to health care\n\nIs the ethical character of health care rationing fundamentally\naltered if we posit a human right to health care for persons with\ndisabilities, as has been recently done by the United Nations\nConvention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN\n2007: Articles 25 and 26)? Does human rights discourse strengthen the\nargument that health resource rationing cannot disadvantage persons\nwith disabilities? Does it put more pressure on the need to ethically\njustify the application of cost effectiveness to allocation decision\nmaking? Does it help us resolve the dilemma that disability poses for\nhealth care allocation?\n\nThe Convention explicitly asserts that all of its specific\nsubstantive rights\u2014to health care, education, employment and so\non\u2014are rooted in the protection of equality (or prohibition of\ndiscrimination) and human dignity. This would suggest that if health\nresource allocation was prejudicial or discriminatory against people\nwith disabilities, it would be a clear human rights violation. This\nassessment would hold whether the people with disabilities were\ndisadvantaged directly and individually from \u201cbedside\nallocation\u201d or indirectly because of the application of\notherwise disability-neutral private or public health care funding\narrangements, or health care allocation policies or strategies.\n\nUnfortunately, the language of human rights adds little to the\ndisability advocate\u2019s already strong argument against ex\nante prejudice or stigma in rationing decision-making, an\nargument that has no impact on the larger problem posed by the dilemma\nof whether disability should matter, and if so, how it should matter.\nIn the case of the UN Convention, the human rights posited\nare not special rights restricted to persons with disabilities, rights\nthat would, for example, directly impact health resource allocation so\nas to favor, or not disfavor, persons with disabilities. On the\ncontrary, the right to health resources is explicitly said to be a\nright to \u201cthe same range, quality and standard of care as\nprovided to other persons\u201d. As long as persons with disabilities\nare treated equally with everyone else in a rationing\nscheme\u2014subject to the same strategy of CEA or egalitarian\nprinciple and augmented with the same measure of benefit\u2014then,\narguably, no human right has been violated. In the context of\ninternational human rights, in short, equality of worth, dignity and\nrespect demands, not special treatment or even equal treatment, but\ntreatment as an equal. It would be as unfair, from this perspective,\nto say that the disability is determinative of health resource\nallocation as it would to say that disability is irrelevant. The\ndilemma, in short, remains.\n",
