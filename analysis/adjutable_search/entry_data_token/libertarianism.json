While\npeople can justifiably be forced to do certain things\u2014most\nobviously, to refrain from infringing the liberty of others\u2014they\ncannot be coerced to serve the good of other members of society, nor\neven their own personal good.\n\nWithin philosophical debates over justice, libertarian positions are\nmost controversial in the realm of distributive justice. In\nthis context, libertarians typically endorse something like a\nfree-market economy\u2014an economic order based on private property\nrights, freedom of contract, and voluntary cooperation. Libertarians\nusually regard contemporary democratic states\u2019 redistribution of\nwealth as an unjustified use of coercion that violates the rights of\nindividuals. The same is true of many forms of economic regulation.\nJust as people have strong rights to individual freedom in their\npersonal and social affairs, libertarians argue, they also have strong\nrights to freedom in their economic affairs. Thus, rights of freedom\nof contract and exchange, freedom of occupation, and private property\nare taken as seriously as rights to choose who to be friends with,\nwhat kind of clothes to wear, and which religion to follow, and so\nforth.\n\nIn respect to justice, libertarian theory inherits a political\nmorality from the classical (or proto-) liberal tradition, embodied by\nJohn Locke, David Hume, Adam Smith, and Immanuel Kant. These authors\nregard the moral function of the state to be the enforcement of a\nsystem of rights that facilitate socioeconomic cooperation, and little\nelse. Moreover, it inherits a political sociology from the\nradical\u2014individualist anarchist\u2014side of the liberal\ntradition associated with Benjamin Tucker, Thomas Hodgskin, and\nLysander Spooner. On their view, state action even when seemingly\nwell-intentioned, is largely an outcome of, or heavily conditioned by,\nthe dynamics of class. In its strongest form, this view takes\nthe state to be the vehicle by which a dominant class uses coercion to\nplunder the rest of society (an idea that was heavily drawn upon, and\naltered, by Karl Marx).\n\nThose engaged in marrying the contemporary libertarian approaches to\nrights and justice with radical critique of the class-state dynamics\nrefer to themselves as \u201cleft-libertarians1\u201d to\ncontrast themselves with a libertarian mainstream or\n\u201cright-libertarianism1\u201d that they take to be\nmore comfortable with actually-existing economic inequality as it\nexists under most capitalist systems, taking it to be an approximation\nof that which would occur in a truly free market. This is to be\ndistinguished from another school of thought known as\n\u201cleft-libertarianism2\u201d that occupies a position\nnarrowly within the contemporary debate over distributive justice.\nLeft-libertarianism2 endorse similar rights over the person\nbut differ with respect to how much people can appropriate in terms of\nunowned natural resources (land, air, water, minerals, etc.).\nRight-libertarianism2 holds that such resources may be\nappropriated, for example, by the first person who discovers them,\nmixes her labor with them, or merely claims them\u2014regardless of\nthe pattern of distribution of property across society this might\ngenerate. Left-libertarianism2, by contrast, holds that\nunappropriated natural resources belong to everyone in some\negalitarian manner. It can, for example, require those who claim\nrights over natural resources to make a payment to others for the\nvalue of those rights. This can provide the basis for a kind of\negalitarian redistribution.\n\nIt is popular to label libertarianism as a \u201cright-wing\u201d\ndoctrine. But this is mistaken. For one, on social\u2014rather than\neconomic\u2014issues, libertarianism tends to be\n\u201cleft-wing\u201d in advocating for radical social liberty in\nthe form of freedom of association, of cultural and religious\nexpression, and sexual liberation. On foreign policy it is also\naligned more with the left in opposing border restrictions and war.\nIts historical entanglement with both radicalism and reaction, as well\nas its approach to rights being used to endorse distributive\negalitarianism, means that it cannot be easily placed on a\ncontemporary left-right partisan spectrum. In a sense, the left-right\nspectrum is itself reiterated within libertarianism, given\nits internal diversity.\n\nLibertarianism is typically taken to be a variety of liberal political\ntheory, though some do contest this (Freeman 2001). The word\n\u201clibertarian\u201d was first used in the 18th\ncentury to refer to a metaphysical view regarding freedom of the will,\nand it was first used as a political term in 19th century\nFrance to refer to communist anarchists (for example, in the journal\nLe Libertaire: Journal du Mouvement Social, edited by Joseph\nD\u00e9jacque), and in the late 19th century it would be\nused by individualist anarchists (for example, in the journal\nLiberty, edited by Benjamin Tucker). In the\nmid-20th century, the label was adopted by liberals who\nwanted to resist certain political developments in many Western states\nfollowing World War 2. After the war, many of the worlds affluent\ndemocracies adopted greater amounts of state involvement in the\neconomy. The sexual revolution had generated significant support for\nsocial liberalism, but those who came to be known as\nclassical liberals and libertarians were concerned to safeguard\neconomic liberalism from a state engaging in more and more central\nplanning of the economy (see Hayek 1944). Whilst many who called\nthemselves liberals were in favour of the state taking a\nbigger role in the economy, those who opposed it called themselves\nclassical liberals or libertarians to\ndistance themselves from these former liberals, and perhaps to\nemphasize that they regarded their position as a purer form\nof liberalism.\n\nThe first and most important text that self-consciously defended\nclassical liberalism in this sense was F. A. Hayek\u2019s three\nvolume work Law, Legislation, and Liberty, with the first\nvolume being published in 1973 just after the publication of John\nRawls\u2019s defence of post-war, interventionist liberalism, A\nTheory of Justice (1971). Hayek is often referred to as a\nclassical liberal as opposed to a libertarian. The latter label is\noften associated particularly with the philosophical framework of\nnatural rights, whereas Hayek focusses on concepts of\npolitical economy and jurisprudence, with an implicitly\nrule-consequentialist normative overtone.\n\nNonetheless, libertarian political philosophy has a great deal to do\nwith Hayek in its concern with addressing an audience that it takes to\nalready be convinced of social liberalism, that economic liberalism\nlogically and normatively follows. Libertarianism, broadly speaking,\nis concerned with proving that just as freedom of association and\nexpression is the social and cultural order of a free people, so the\nfree market is the economic order of a free people.\n\nHayek was a leading figure of the Austrian School of\neconomics, within which Murray Rothbard, a generation younger than\nHayek, was also educated. Rothbard was the major voice of\nlibertarianism in the United States during and after his lifetime. He\nco-founded the libertarian think-tank The Cato Institute, the\nCentre for Libertarian Studies, and the Ludwig von Mises\nInstitute. He would also become a significant influence on Robert\nNozick when they met in New York City, who would then bring that very\nlibertarianism into academic philosophy.\n\nThe content of libertarian political philosophy, broadly speaking, is\na claim that the initiation of interpersonal force is unjust. This is\ncombined with an understanding of property rights as an essential\ncomponent of personal liberty, as well as an analysis of law, that\nrenders all state-made law on a moral par with any other threat of\nforce. On this basis, libertarians usually argue that almost all state\naction is unjust, and that state interventions in the economy are as\nmorally problematic as state interventions in our personal choices\nregarding our bodies and social lives.\n\nThere are a variety of moral foundations that libertarians draw upon\nfor their central normative claims. Within the discipline of\nphilosophy, libertarianism is most famously deontological (Rothbard\n1978, 1982, Nozick 1974, Mack 1981, 1989, 1990, 1998, 1999, 2010,\n2018, Steiner 1994), taking a cue from both John Locke and Immanuel\nKant. However, others are Aristotelian eudaimonists (Rasmussen and Den\nUyl 1991, 2005, 2016, 2020), contractualists of various kinds\n(Narveson 2011, Lomasky 1987, 2016, Gaus 2009, 2010, 2012), or\nrule-consequentialists (Epstein, 1995, 1998, 2015, Barnett 1998b).\nMany are implicitly rule-consequentialist, depending\nprimarily on economic arguments rather than moral philosophical ones\n(Friedman 1997, Pennington 2011, Tebble 2016). Note that whilst it is\nvery common for libertarians of all stripes to articulate their\npolitical philosophy in terms of rights, they will not all\nground those rights deontologically. For example, for Aristotelian\neudaimonists, rights are the metaethical framework that makes\nself-directed virtue possible in a social context; for\ncontractualists, sets of rights might be the output of a contractarian\nprocedure; for economists, rights might be an efficient legal\nframework, etc.\n", "toc": [{"#SelfOwneEconJust": "1.

Self-Ownership and Economic Justice\n\nThe publication of Robert Nozick\u2019s book, Anarchy, State, and\nUtopia (1974) was the first time mainstream academic philosophy\nwas forced to pay attention to libertarian ideas. Within philosophy,\ntherefore, libertarianism revolved heavily around this book\u2019s\nreception. G. A. Cohen was one of the most important of Nozick\u2019s\ncritics, but he nonetheless sympathized with what he took to be the\ncore commitment of justice in Nozick\u2019s theory \u2013\nself-ownership. He therefore made the connection between\nself-ownership and libertarian views regarding economic justice the\ncentral area of problematization, and the literature developed for\nsome decades in that way.\n\nSelf-ownership is the idea that all individuals have ownership rights\nover themselves, and therefore may do whatever they choose with\nthemselves so long as they do not violate the self-ownership of\nothers. Nozick believed, following Locke, that natural property rights\nover our own person could ground natural private property rights\nbeyond the person, and therefore indicate that a market-based economic\nsystem is just. Cohen, however, took it that self-ownership explained\nthe unjustly exploitative nature of capitalism. Following Karl Marx,\nCohen supposed that capitalists expropriate the fruits of\nworker\u2019s labour\u2014something that naturally belongs to the\nworker herself. Despite Nozick only mentioning self-ownership once,\nand developing a large number of arguments against redistributive\nconceptions of economic justice which do not explicitly invoke or rely\non the idea of self-ownership throughout part II of Anarchy,\nState, and Utopia, self-ownership became synonymous with\nlibertarianism.\n\nSelf-ownership means that individuals have a very stringent (perhaps\nthe most stringent possible) set of rights over their persons, giving\nthem the kind of control over themselves that one has over possessions\none holds as private property. This includes (1) control\nrights over the use of the entity: both a liberty-right to use it\nand a claim-right that others not use it without one\u2019s consent,\n(2) rights to transfer these rights to others (by sale,\nrental, gift, or loan), (3) immunities to the non-consensual\nloss of these rights, (4) rights to compensation if\nsomeone uses the entity without one\u2019s permission, and (5)\nenforcement rights (including rights of prior restraint if\nsomeone is about to violate these rights). Central to this idea of\nself-ownership is the right to control ourselves, and to exclude\nothers from making use of us. Self-ownership, in other words,\noffers protections against others doing things to us against our will\n(unless it is our will to violate someone else\u2019s self-ownership,\nof course).\n\nThe idea of self-ownership is attractive for many reasons. We\nrecognize people as self-owners when we recognize that there are\nthings that may not be done to a person without their consent, but\nwhich may be done with consent. As such, it is a way of explaining the\nso-called \u201cmoral magic of consent\u201d (cf. Barnett 1986a,\nAlexander 1996, Hurd 1996). Thus, we consider rape wrong because it\ninvolves a body being used against the will of the person to whom it\nbelongs, but not because there\u2019s something inherently wrong with\nsexual intercourse. We consider assault wrong for similar reasons, but\nallow voluntary boxing matches. We consider slavery wrong, but allow\nconsensual employment. There are also more theoretical reasons for\nself-ownership\u2019s attraction. The principle is a strong\nendorsement of the moral importance and sovereignty of the individual,\nand it expresses the refusal to treat people as mere things to use or\ntrade off against each other. It expresses the liberal notion\n(asserted by John Rawls against utilitarianism) of the moral\n\u201cseparateness of persons\u201d (Zwolinski 2008).\n\nIn many contexts, self-ownership may be intuitively very attractive.\nIt offers, for instance, a straightforward and unequivocal\ncondemnation of chattel slavery. It grounds the defense of\nwomen\u2019s rights over their bodies, including the right to\nterminate unwanted pregnancies (Thomson 1971, Long 1993) It explains\nwhy it is wrong to sacrifice the rights and freedoms of minorities\n(even a minority of one) for the sake of protecting the interests of\nthe majority. It offers a principled objection to paternalism. And so\non.\n\nSelf-ownership does, however, crowd out other moral considerations,\nincluding ones that are often thought relevant to justice. For\nexample, it rules out the view that individuals have an enforceable\nduty to come to the assistance of others, if when they are in serious\nor urgent need (accept as a result of prior wrongdoing). For persons\nto have such an enforceable duty would be for it to be, in principle,\njustified for A to threaten B with force in order to\nget her to assist C (C being in need of assistance).\nHowever, this threat of force would involve a violation of\nB\u2019s self-ownership by A, since\nB\u2019s self-ownership includes a right to exclude others\nfrom taking control of her body and her actions without her consent.\nAny inclusion of enforceable, positive duties will remove much of the\nprotective content of self-ownership (see Flanigan 2018).\n\nAn implication of this is that taxation for the purposes of giving\nassistance to other members of society is ruled out. Nozick argued\nthat since taxation siphons off part of people\u2019s earnings, which\nrepresent people\u2019s labor, and people initially have the right\nnot to be forced to work for certain ends. Therefore, Nozick argued,\nredistributive taxation is morally on a par with forced labor (1974,\nch. 7). Self-ownership does not say that is something wrong with\ncoming to the assistance of others, nor even necessarily with\nrelations of dependence. But it does say there is something very wrong\nwith using force to get people to provide such assistance or to enter\ninto such relations.\n\nNozick\u2019s point was that theories of economic justice face a\nchoice. One can (a) respect people as the primary controllers of their\nlives, labor, and bodies. This means working for whomever they want,\non the terms they consent to, and deciding for themselves what is to\nbe done with the fruits of their labour. Recognizing this leaves no\nroom for a conception of economic justice that requires a particular\npattern of distribution. The composition of each individual\u2019s personal\nchoices as to how to contract with others will undo any given pattern\nof distribution the state seeks, and the state would have to deny\npeople their respective choices that lead to interruptions to the\npattern. Or one can (b) endorse the enforcement of certain\ndistributions. But in that case, the theory must endorse taking what\npeople innocently produce through their own labor, redirecting their\nwork to purposes they did not freely choose. This latter option is\nunacceptable to anyone endorsing the idea of self-ownership. As Nozick\nwrote, it involves claiming a kind of control over the lives of others\nthat is similar to a claim of ownership in them (1974, p. 172).\n\nNozick was also pointing to an incoherence within theories of\ndistributive justice. The point of distributing things to people is so\nthat they can enjoy the benefits of owning those things. Most\nimportantly, so they can, through their choices, use those things to\nimprove their lives. Invariably this will involve using them in\neconomic transactions. If a theory of distributive justice does not\npermit people to actually do the things they choose with what they\nhave, then it undermines the point in them having them at all. (Long\n2002, also see Schmidtz 2011)\n\nSelf-ownership is a key libertarian idea not just conceptually, but\nrhetorically. It demonstrates the central libertarian preoccupation\nwith showing that a commitment to personal or social liberty directly\nentails economic liberty in the form of private property and\ncontractual freedom \u2013 that economic and social liberty cannot be\nseparated, as post-war liberalism attempted to do.\n\nHowever, liberal egalitarians following Cohen\u2019s critique of the\nconnection between self-ownership and world-ownership that\nlibertarianism depends upon, were keen to separate the two. Seeking to\nsquare self-ownership and natural private property rights with\negalitarian distributive justice, Hillel Steiner, followed by Peter\nVallentyne and Michael Otsuka, developed a theory that endorsed\nself-ownership alongside an egalitarian principle of world-ownership.\nThis approach to distributive justice became known as\n\u201cleft-libertarianism\u201d\n(left-libertarianism2\u2014to be distinguished from\nleft-libertarianism1 that will be discussed below). The\ntraditional approach that did not put a distributive constraint on\nworld-ownership therefore came to be known as\n\u201cright-libertarianism1\u201d.\n\nOthers sought a similar theory of economic justice, but that did not\ndepend upon intuitions regarding the initial egalitarian ownership of\nthe external world. On these views, self-ownership, along with all\nproperty rights, can be split into control-rights and\nincome-rights. They argue that these two rights need not be\nattached; having the right to control the disposition of an object\ndoes not presuppose a right to recoup the entire value of the income\nstream the object\u2019s disposition generates. On this view the\nintuitive appeal of self-ownership (the control rights) can be\nendorsed whilst the income rights be subject to social distribution.\n(Gibbard 1976, Christman 1994) Such views depend upon self-ownership\nrights and property rights generally to be decomposable (Grey 1980,\nAttas 2006, also see Honor\u00e9 1961) which property essentialists\ndeny (Stern 2017). Whilst right-libertarians2 do not\nnecessarily deny that ownership is a bundle of logically distinct\nrights, they deny that control rights and income rights can be\nnormatively separated in this way (see Wheeler 1980, Rothbard 1982,\nMack 1990, and Long 2012 [Other Internet Resources]) indeed, this is\none the central tasks Nozick sets himself.\n\nAn internal issue is a debate over whether self-ownership may permit\nvoluntary enslavement. Agents have, on this view, not only the right\nto control the use of their person, but also the right to\ntransfer that right (e.g., by sale or gift) to others.\nHowever, this is controversial among libertarians, some of whom deny\nthat such transfers are possible because others cannot control\none\u2019s will. Whilst our rights of self-ownership can be\nwaived they cannot be permanently alienated (Epstein\n1973, 1979, Evers 1977, Rothbard 1982; Smith 1997, Barnett 1998a,\n1998b, pp. 78\u201382, Kinsella 1998/1999). Some argue that in order\nfor a right to an object to be transferred, it must be possible for\nour possession of the object to be de facto surrenderable\n(Evers 1977, Rothbard 1982). This is not the case with ourselves as we\nalways have privileged, agent-type control over ourselves, through\nwhich third parties must act if they wish to control us. Such a view\nof contractual transfer is compatible with labour contracts in general\nbut not specific-performance contracts in particular.\n\nTheorists who endorse the possibility of voluntary enslavement usually\nargue that self-ownership is a theory about the moral right to control\npermissible use (by giving or denying permission), not about the\npsychological capacity to control (Block 2003). Thus, similarly, the\nright to exercise one\u2019s autonomy is more fundamental\nthan the protection or promotion of one\u2019s autonomy over\ntime (Vallentyne 1998; Steiner 1994). Others argue that such a\ntransfer would undermine our autonomy (Grunebaum 1987), or reject the\npermissibility of such a transfer on theological grounds (Locke 1690,\nOlsthoorn, 2020).\n\nA second internal concern of self-ownership points out its restrictive\nimplications. Full self-ownership might seem to condemn as wrongful\neven very minor infringements of the personal sphere, such as when\ninnocuous particles of pollution fall upon an unconsenting person.\nProhibiting all acts that can lead to such minor infringements poses\nan unacceptable limit on our right to actually engage in\nactivities\u2014seemingly, to the very liberty self-ownership is\nsupposed to safeguard. But from the point of view of self-ownership,\nthere is no principled difference between minor infringements and\nmajor infringements. Whilst they may require different degrees of\nenforcement and compensation, both are equally morally prohibited.\nThus, this objection goes, self-ownership places such strong\nprotections for our liberty, it makes us mutually unable to act on our\nliberty. Thus, it must be rejected as motivationally incoherent\n(Railton 2003, Sobel 2012)\n\nThis objection, however, presupposes an implausible conception of\nself-ownership that its defenders need not endorse. Suppose we\nunderstand the moral benefits that self-ownership confers along two\ndimensions: protections from unwanted uses of our bodies, and\nliberties to use our bodies. As the objection points out, it is not\npossible to simultaneously maximize the value of both dimensions: our\nprotections restrict our liberties by restricting the possible uses of\none\u2019s body, and vice versa. Since maximizing the\nprotection-dimension implausibly restricts the use-dimension, the\ncorrect response is not to reject self-ownership, but rather to loosen\nthe protection-dimension somewhat in order to enhance the\nuse-dimension. Doing this would allow minor infringements for the sake\nof self-ownership. As Eric Mack (2015) puts it, a good theory of\nself-ownership offers people some \u201celbow room.\u201d This is\nenabled by ensuring that our claim-rights (whose purpose is to\nsafeguard the exercise of our liberty-rights) are not made stronger\nthan they need to be.\n\nMoreover, this critique seems to be deploying a notion of\nself-ownership few if any libertarians in fact endorse. Indeed, in\nCohen\u2019s critique of Nozick\u2019s libertarianism, he developed\nthe idea of \u201cfull\u201d self-ownership and ascribed this view\nto Nozick (1985, 1986, 1995). Full self-ownership is simply the\nlogically strongest set of ownership rights over oneself. But\nthere is no need for self-ownership to be as logically strong\nas is possible, it needs to be strong enough to safeguard the values\nand principles is expresses, and so-called full self-ownership does\nnot appear to do that, and hence few if any libertarians support\nit.\n\nIt is noteworthy that under the common law understanding of private\nproperty and nuisance, minor and insensible physical boundary\ncrossings that do not interfere with normal use and enjoyment of the\nproperty in question, are not considered violations of a right of\nownership. Given that ordinary private ownership rights do not give us\nthe right to exclude minor physical boundary-crossings in this way,\nsome argue there is no reason self-ownership should either. Moreover,\nit is not clear why a notion of self-ownership that does not include\nit should thereby be considered any less \u201cfull.\u201d\n(Christmas 2021c, pp.48\u201351)\n\nMaking modifications to full self-ownership may be necessary to make\nit a plausible principle and to make it coherent alongside other\nvalues. This threatens the status of self-ownership as a foundational\nprinciple in libertarian theory. Presumably, foundational principles\nare not based on underlying values. For many libertarians, this is not\nmuch of a concession, however. If few endorse full self-ownership,\neven fewer endorse it as a foundational principle.\n2. Property Rights and Original Acquisition\n\nLibertarians conceive of distributive justice as largely (sometimes\nexclusively) historical in nature. To ask whether justice obtains in\nthe world is mainly to ask whether people have been justly treated,\nprincipally whether their rights to their persons and possessions have\nbeen respected. Libertarians generally see people\u2019s rightful\npossessions as whatever they acquired in legitimate (i.e.,\nrights-respecting) ways. As a result, they reject theories that\nconnect entitlement to outcomes or end-state distributions. In Kantian\nlanguage, libertarians believe distributive justice is\nexhausted by commutative justice. As long as no wrongs have\nbeen inflicted by one individual upon another at private law, the\noverall distribution is without moral remainder. There is no way of a\ndistribution to be unjust other than by it resulting from some sort of\nprivate law wrong(s).\n\nThe most common mode of just acquisition is through voluntary\ntransfer. This is why libertarians generally defend noncoerced\n(Christmas 2022a), nondeceptive (Ferguson 2018) market relations as\njust. Nozick\u2019s \u201centitlement theory\u201d of distributive\njustice consists entirely of these two modes of acquisition and a\nprinciple of rectification for their violation. Redistribution is\ntherefore in principle limited to when it is necessary to correct for\nwrongful takings (Byas 2022). However, for A\u2019s\nentitlement to some possession x to be legitimized by\nB\u2019s voluntary transfer of x to A,\nB\u2019s prior entitled to x needs to be\nestablished. There must, at least in principle, be a starting point;\nan original acquisition through which objects that are not\nowned by anyone \u2013 that no one in particular has unique\nentitlement to \u2013 come to be owned by some particular person\n(Christmas 2021c, pp. 3\u20134).\n\nLibertarians generally accept that individuals can carry out such acts\nof original acquisition. More precisely, they accept that individuals\ncan acquire unowned goods unilaterally, without there needing to be\nauthorization by some pre-existing political institution nor needing\nto obtain the consent of other people.\n\nThe most famous account of how unilateral original acquisition is\npossible remains Locke\u2019s labor theory. According to Locke, when\npeople work on previously unowned objects, subject to certain\nprovisos, they turn those objects into their private property. The\nprecise nature of Locke\u2019s argument, the relation between labor\nand acquisition, as well as the nature of the provisos, is hotly\ncontested. The most famous interpretation, again, seeks to ground\nproperty in the (prior) rights of self-ownership. On this view, when\npeople labor they quite literally extend their claims of\nself-ownership over external objects, thus drawing them into their\nrights-protected sphere. As Locke (1690, ch. 5) put it, since laboring\nmixes one\u2019s self-owned labor with something that is unowned, the\npreviously unowned thing becomes owned.\n\nSo stated, this argument suffers from well-known problems. For\ninstance, since laboring is an activity, the idea of mixing it with an\nobject seems at best a metaphor for something else (Hume 1739,\nIII.II.IIVI fn., Day 1966, Waldron 1983, 1988, pp. 184\u201391). But\nin that case, the argument is incomplete\u2014we still need to know\nwhat really grounds property rights. More importantly, it simply is\nnot true that mixing something owned with something unowned is\nsufficient for appropriation. As Nozick pointed out, if I pour a can\nof tomato juice that I own into the unowned ocean, I lose my tomato\njuice\u2014I do not gain an ocean (Nozick 1974, pp. 174\u20135).\nIndeed, Locke himself noted that acts of labour cannot acquire\nownership of the sea (though, they can acquire ownership of fish\ncaught in the sea) (1690 II.30) Third, when the object with which one\nmixes one\u2019s labour is already owned by someone else, this is\ntypically regarded as a way of dissipating or donating one\u2019s\nlabour (Thomson 1990, pp. 326\u2013327).\n\nThere are two prominent defences of a labour-based account of original\nacquisition. The first is Hillel Steiner\u2019s physicalistic version\n(1994, p. 233 fn). On this view we literally mix energy that\nwe own with unowned objects when we labour on them. The idea of mixing\nactivities with objects does not, therefore, need to enter. However,\nwe often expend our energy into all sorts of things that few want to\nclaim we thereby appropriate, often with no intention or volition in\ndoing so. We involuntarily transfer heat into the atmosphere, for\nexample. Moreover, attempts to appropriate things often do not involve\ntransfers of energy into that particular object, but rather our\npossession of the object is the result of our energy\ntransfers into other objects. For example, in capturing a wild animal.\nWhilst this rescues the metaphysical idea of labour-mixing as one in\nwhich ownership literally \u201cseeps over into the rest\u201d as\nNozick puts it (1974, p. 174), it raises serious questions over\nwhether labouring upon things is actually the way to acquire them\nsince it is neither necessary nor sufficient to mixing our energy with\nthem (Christmas 2021c, p. 74).\n\nThe second is an indirect account (van der Vossen 2021a, 2021b [Other\nInternet Resources]). On this view, unilateral acquisition enables us\nto come to own the fruits of our labour in an economic rather than a\nphysical sense. This approach seeks to tie considerations regarding\nthe material prosperity that systems of private property and contracts\nbring about into the justification of unilateral acquisition, without\nmaking the entire theory a merely rule-consequentialist one.\n\nThere is a broad and influential line of consequentialist argument\nthat ties the justification of property to the material prosperity and\nwell-being that it brings about. Rights of private property serve to\ndivide the external world into a number of discrete, individual parts,\neach exclusively controlled by its particular owner. Organizing the\nsocial world in this way is preferable to collective use or ownership\nbecause it helps avoid collective action problems. When things remain\nheld in open-access commons, we all have an incentive to use as much\nas we can, leading to a general pattern of use that ends up depleting\nthe resource, to everyone\u2019s detriment. Rights to private\nproperty not only avoid such a \u201ctragedy of the commons,\u201d\nthey also incentivize people to preserve their parts, increase their\nproductivity, and exchange what they own with others on mutually\nbeneficial terms (Schmidtz 1994; Buchanan 1993). The indirect\nlabour-mixing account incorporates these considerations in a\nnon-consequentialist way, as Nozick claimed to be trying to do (1974,\np. 177).\n\nMany have offered non-labour-based defenses of unilateral acquisition.\nOn such views, unilateral acquisition is taken to be a requirement of\nour being project pursuers or purposive agents (Lomasky 1987; Mack\n1990, 2010, Wendt 2022). Such accounts often argue for the\nimpossibility of separating our biomass from our tools; acquisition on\nthis view just being an entailment of making objects part of our\nactions and therefore inseparable from our bodily rights (Wheeler\n1980), and therefore presupposes no distinct power to create\nnew property rights. A common critique of approaches to libertarianism\ngrounded in a non-aggression principle (NAP) is that is assumes\nwithout argument that property rights violations constitute\naggressions against the person, when the connection of property to\nperson is precisely the point of contention (Zwolinski 2016).\nConnecting external property rights to personal or bodily rights\nvindicates the NAP-based approaches (Christmas 2018b).\n\nOther justifications depend neither on accepting a prior thesis of\nself-ownership, nor on the affiliated thesis that self-ownership\nrights can be extended outwardly through labor. Instead, these\narguments point to the moral importance of people having security over\nexternal resources. Sometimes this is understood in terms of support\nfor political and civil liberties (Friedman 1962, Gaus 2010). Since\nthese justifications of property do not rest on a prior principle of\nself-ownership, they are not committed to seeing property rights as\nabsolute as self-self-ownership advocates take those rights to be.\nThey therefore need not be as immune to regulation and taxation.\nDespite what is sometimes suggested (Freeman 2001), virtually all\nlibertarians that reject self-ownership as a starting point also\naccept that property rights need specification, can be instantiated in\nquite different, yet morally acceptable forms, and might be overridden\nby other moral considerations. Such views do not entail the\nimpossibility of unilateral original appropriation either.\n\nLibertarians and their critics are concerned with the issue of\noriginal appropriation primarily because it demarcates a major fault\nline in political philosophy. The libertarian\u2019s historical\nconception of justice, and the accompanying insistence that\ngovernments refrain from redistributive projects, require that\nproperty rights do not depend on the government, positive law, or the\nconsent of others for their moral validity. Such a view is viable if\none can establish the possibility of unilateral appropriation, without\nessential reference to the existence of the state or law.\n\nThe strongest objection to this area of libertarian thought comes from\nneo-Kantian legal and political philosophers who draw up Kant\u2019s\narguments that acquisition of property rights in a state of nature is\nconceptually incoherent at worst, and unjust at best. Neo-Kantians\nlargely agree with libertarians that the primary authorization for the\nuse of coercion in society is to secure freedom for all individuals,\nand such individual freedom is borne out in large part through\ncontractual freedom and private property rights. However, they\ndisagree with libertarians in that they believing that state authority\nis ontologically foundational to individual freedom.\n\nNeo-Kantians argue that property rights cannot be unilaterally\nacquired outside of a state\u2019s authorization for one or more of\nthree reasons: (1) Property rights in a state of nature would be\nindeterminate; leading not only to the high likelihood of\ninsoluble disputes (over boundaries and the like), but the\ninevitability of them. Without a state to lay down a judgement over\nwhat counts as whose property and enforce it, disputes have no\nprincipled answer, and therefore there is no fact of the matter about\nwhat rights and duties individuals have in these cases. (2)\nUnilateral acquisition and determination of property rights\nconstitutes the imposition of one person\u2019s will on all others.\nHaving the authority to create new duties and impose them on all\nothers by one\u2019s discretionary choice is not something one could\nhave among equals. Having the content of one\u2019s duties being\nsubject to another\u2019s arbitrary will is to be unfree and unequal\non the Kantian view. (3) In a state of nature, any putative rights are\nnot assured. Without a guarantee of some sort that our person\nand possessions be secured against violence, we are authorized to take\npre-emptive action against potential aggressors, and they against us,\nmeaning that no one is under any duty to abstain from using force\nagainst others. According to neo-Kantians, having a state provides a\nsolution to all these problems. Its geographical monopoly on the use\nof force means it can determinately lay down a scheme of rights and\nduties under law and credibly enforce it (overcoming problems 1 and\n3). Moreover, the state is not just another private actor, on this\nview, but rather has the capacity to act on behalf of all \u2013 it\nis an omnilateral actor rather than unilateral. Therefore its use of\ncoercion to secure rights does not subject us to any arbitrary will\n(solving problem 2). In short, property rights can only be created by\na public power. (Waldron 1996, 1999 part 2, Flikschuh 1999,\n2000 ch. 4, 2008, Varden 2008, 2010; Ripstein 2009 ch. 6, 2012, Stilz\n2009, ch. 2; 2011; 2012; Hodgson 2010; Pallikkathayil 2010; Sinclair\n2018).\n\nBecause of this, some neo-Kantians argue that since the state is\nontologically prior to property rights, there are limits to how much\nwork an historical entitlement theory can do in justifying particular\nholdings. There are no acts of original acquisition that vindicate a\nchain of transfers leading up to the present, but rather it is state\nauthority vindicates property rights. State redistribution, therefore,\ncannot be condemned on the basis that it violates property rights\n\u2013 it is the state\u2019s coercion that creates\nproperty rights. (Hasan 2018) In a state of nature, individuals can,\nat best, only acquire \u201cprovisional\u201d property rights,\nmeaning that they are at liberty to make use of these objects, but\nothers are not duty-bound to respect your claim, and neither would a\nstate once it is established be obligated to treat it as a\nfully-fledged property right. (Kant 1797, 6.255, Ripstein 2009 p. 165,\nStilz 2009 p.45, 2018, Hasan 2018, Messina 2019)\n\nLibertarian responses to these criticisms have taken the form of\narguing that unilateral acquisition is merely the specification of a\nright we already have rather than the creation of new rights through\nsome arbitrary power. It therefore does not presuppose any superior\nmoral status of the acquirer nor does it problematically subject third\nparties (van der Vossen 2009, 2015, Sazanov 2022). On this view,\noriginal acquisition (when done justly) is a case of duty-activation\nrather than duty-creation. Similarly, it has been argued that property\nrights can be made determinate by constitutive social conventions that\ndo not require any state authority, and so long as property rights are\ndeterminate, the other problems fall away (Christmas 2021a).\n\nLeft-libertarianism2 here can be seen to side-step the\nobjection in virtue of its commitment to an equal distribution of\nexternal property. So long as your unilateral acquisition cannot be\nsaid to be greater than your equal share, there is no moral remainder\n(Steiner 2017, 2000, cf. Sage 2012).\n3. Other Routes to Libertarianism\n\nAs noted above, there are a variety of moral foundations that\nlibertarians draw upon for their central normative claims. Whilst most\nlibertarians will articulate the structure of libertarianism in terms\nof rights, by no means do all libertarians believe rights to be\nfoundational in a deontological sense, let alone that the most\nvaluable articulation of them is in the form of universal\nself-ownership. In this section we will briefly discuss other moral\nand conceptual inputs that yield roughly libertarian outputs in\npolitical philosophy.\n\nSome libertarians ground their political philosophy in\nneo-Aristotelian eudaimonism. On this view, the moral life is\nfundamentally understood the flourishing of the individual in terms of\nfulfilling or perfecting their nature or telos, achieving a state of\neudaimonia. The unique way in which we each flourish requires\na community to flourish within and as a part of, but it also must be,\nat bottom, a self-directed process due to its uniqueness. Therefore,\nit is an ethical imperative to both live within a society, and to have\none\u2019s potential for individual practical reasoning protected.\nDouglas Rasmussen and Douglass Den Uyl (1991, 2005, 2016, 2020) argue\nthat individual rights to negative liberty render each person\u2019s\nflourishing compossible with others\u2019. These rights allow\nindividuals to participate in the community (or a variety of\ncommunities) as they deem fit in light of their practical reason, but\ndoes not allow anyone to pursue flourishing in a way that morally\ncannibalizes the flourishing of others. Rasmussen and Den Uyl argue\nthat rights, on this view, are metanormative principles that are\nnecessary for ordinary normativity to operate within a social context.\nLibertarian justice then is a sort of meta-virtue that enables a\ndiversity of other forms of virtue. Some argue that this approach must\nconverge with a certain kind of deontological approach (Christmas\n2018a), but Rasmussen and Den Uyl resist this (2018). Indeed, there is\na broader tradition of grounding natural rights in Aristotelian ethics\nwithin natural law theory, going back to St. Thomas Aquinas (1947,\nalso see Finnis 2011).\n\nOther libertarians deploy a contractualist or contractarian framework\nof moral reasoning in order to arrive at libertarian conclusions. For\nexample, Loren Lomasky argues from an egoistic rational choice\nframework that it is rational for individuals to adopt a framework of\nindividual, negative rights (2016, 1987, also see Narveson 2011).\nWhilst Gerald Gaus deploys the public reason framework to argue for a\nstate that is constitutionally constrained along libertarian lines\n(2009, 2010, 2012). What these views share is that whilst libertarian\nrights may be the most just ideal of rights, they must be discovered\nor constructed through a rational and social process, rather than\nderived logically from human nature or abstract reason.\n\nRule-consequentialist libertarians argue that social welfare is\noptimized by society adopting libertarian rules. Richard Epstein\nargues that legal rules that protect individual rights against one\nanother and against the state generate higher amounts of social\nwelfare than legal rules that permit significant amounts of\nexpropriation and coercion (Epstein, 1995, 1998, 2015, also see\nBarnett 1998b). On this view rights are justified to the extent that\nthey serve this welfare-enhancing role over time as part of a legal\nsystem, but have little or no intrinsic value in and of themselves.\nThis view therefore permits state-takings of private property where it\nis conducive to the general welfare (Epstein 1985). The methodology of\nlaw and economics is central to this school of thought. It\nseeks to use empirical research to investigate the economic efficiency\nof different legal arrangements. Ronald Coase\u2019s paper \u201cThe\nProblem of Social Cost\u201d (1960) is typically seen as the\ninaugural work in this vein.\n\nOther libertarians are more implicitly rule-consequentialist and\ndeploy economic arguments for the kinds of political and legal\narrangements libertarians favour \u2013 specifically, epistemic\narguments (Friedman 1997, Pennington 2011, Tebble 2016). They will\noften argue that institutions of private property and freedom of\ncontract, enforced by a constitutionally constrained state, are the\nbest way of ensuring social knowledge is deployed in pro-social ways,\nand will point to constraints on how far this knowledge can be\ncentralized by even a presumptively benevolent central planner. These\narguments are drawn explicitly from Hayek (cf. Boettke 2018) and the\nAustrian School of economic thought more broadly (see especially Mises\n1935, Hayek 1945, Kirzner 1997).\n\nA subtle approach that does not easily fit into the categories above\nfollows the work of Adam Smith, claiming that libertarian ideas are\ninherent in our ordinary moral psychology and how it interacts with\ncommercial society (cf. Otteson 2012, Schmidtz 2016, Cowen &\nGeloso 2021, Cowen 2021). Smith famously considered justice to be\nstrictly negative in nature \u2013 something we satisfy simply\nthrough abstaining from theft, coercion, and other violations of\nlibertarian rights. Thus, in The Theory of Moral Sentiments,\nSmith wrote that the rules that \u201ccall loudest for vengeance and\npunishment are the laws which guard the life and person of our\nneighbour; the next are those which guard his property and\npossessions; and last of all come those which guard what are called\nhis personal rights, or what is due to him from the promises of\nothers.\u201d (Smith 1976 [1759], p. 84) These are the only acts that\nare generally disapproved of in a way calling for punishment. (1976\n[1759], p. 78) Rule-following of this kind is desirable because\nit\u2019s conducive to the stability and effectiveness of society.\n(1976 [1759], p. 86) None of this means that people do not have\nobligations to assist others. Smith grounds his view in a deeply\nsocial view of moral psychology. Thus, benevolence along with justice\nis a pillar of society. However, we cannot expect or force people to\ncare for distant strangers in the same way as they care for\nthemselves. And trying to organize a society along these lines would\nlead to disaster. Smith was extremely skeptical about government\nofficials, writing about how they seek fame and power, think\nthemselves morally superior, and are more than willing to serve their\nown interests and those of well-connected businessmen rather than the\npublic good. (Smith 1976 [1776], pp. 266\u20137). And, perhaps\nforeshadowing Hayek, Smith argued that governments are generally\nincapable of knowing enough to guide large numbers of people. Human\nbeings make their own decisions and respond to circumstances, thus\nthwarting any systematic plans the government might lay out for them.\nThus, as a rule, it is more promising to appeal to people\u2019s\nself-interest through market exchange than to use state coercion.\nLibertarian arguments of this kind cast the state as an arbitrator, an\nimpartial agent that makes fair and productive cooperation between\ncitizens possible, much like a referee enables fair play by\nadministering the rules of the game. It is crucial, then, for the\nstate to remain impartial and not choose sides in society or the\neconomy. Once governments begin benefiting one party over another,\nwhether this be certain groups in society or business interests, such\ninvolvement is in principle off-limits and likely to backfire as it\nwill favor whoever is politically well-connected or favored at the\ntime. The minimal state, then, is the only state capable of\nstructuring complex and deeply interdependent societies in ways that\nare mutually beneficial.\n4. Libertarianism, Left and Right\n\nThere are two active ways in which libertarianism is self-consciously\ndeployed as a left-wing as opposed to a right-wing philosophy. There\nis a left/right paradigm in the broader history of libertarian thought\nthat hinges on whether or not, broadly speaking, it is deployed as a\nradical project or a reactionary one. The other is narrowly within the\ndebate over distributive justice, and hinges on principles concerning\nownership of external resources that are posited alongside\nself-ownership.\n\nWithin the first paradigm, left-libertarianism1 refers to\nan approach that takes its cue largely from the American individualist\nanarchism of figures such as Benjamin Tucker, Thomas Hodgskin, and\nLysander Spooner, and to a lesser extent, early radical French\nliberalism of Jean-Baptiste Say, Charles Comte, and Charles Dunoyer.\nThe chief contemporary advocates of left-libertarianism1\nare Gary Chartier and Roderick Long.\n\nLeft-libertarianism1 typically maintains the familiar\nnormative and deontological commitment to justice as constituted by\nstrong rights of all individuals to freedom of action, social\nassociation, and economic cooperation (understood as rights of\nproperty and contract). However, it couples that normative framework\nwith a set of descriptive commitments. Namely, it holds close to a\nclass-based view of political sociology developed by radical liberals\nsuch as Say, Comte, and Dunoyer (see Weinburg 1978, Hart 1990) as well\nas Franz Oppenheimer (1914, also see Rothbard 2009) that places the\nstate within a class-based analysis of human history. Coupled together\nthese commitments generate a radical critique of the state as the\nchief vehicle of plutocracy, and myriad other forms of domination that\nmake people unfree.\n\nLeft-libertarians1 regard the state as inherently unjust in\nvirtue of not being consented to (Tucker 1893, Spooner 1870, 1882,\n1886, Long 1995, Chartier 2011b, 2012). The state is also regarded as\ninstrumentally dangerous in that its monopoly on the use of force\nmakes it the play-thing of groups that seek to dominate and exploit\nother groups (Long 2008c, 2012 [Other Internet Resources], Chartier\n2011b). It does not regard the state as a mere epiphenomenon of\nplutocratic power, but rather as empirically instrumental to\nplutocratic power.\n\nModern advocates of left-libertarianism1 regard state\ncoercion as being both constitutively related to broader forms of\ndomination and instrumentally related to them (Christmas 2016).\nCrucially, left-libertarians1 typically regard the economic\nconditions of actually-existing capitalism as being largely an effect\nof state interventions on behalf of incumbent capitalist interests\n(Chartier & Johnson 2011). Some argue that a market freed of state\ninterference would be one in which there were more, smaller, more\ncooperatively organised, productive units, and in which inequality of\nincome would be lower. Some argue more strongly that it would be\nindistinguishable from anarchist socialism. For this reason, most\nleft-libertarians1 describe their position as\n\u201canti-capitalist\u201d. They maintain a strong distinction\nbetween a free market based political economy and\ncapitalist political economy where the latter involves either\nstate-capital partnership or capitalist domination of society, or both\n(Chartier 2011a, Long, 2008a). Some argue for these conclusions based\non the \u201ccost-principle\u201d of classical political economy\nthat said where there is a lack of monopoly, prices would tend toward\ncost, making cooperative enterprise the most efficient productive\nmodel (Carson 2007, 2008). Others argue for similar conclusions from\nmodern, marginalist economic theory (Long 2008a). Central to both\nanalyses is that monopoly power is responsible for aberrations from a\nmore egalitarian market equilibrium. And that monopoly power is, in\nturn, enabled by the state \u2013 the monopoliser of coercion itself,\nwhich is the chief enabler of all other monopolies (Tucker 1888).\n\nWhilst it may have been reasonable for the early American\nindividualist anarchists to believe that market forces were an\negalitarian, equilibrating force given the level of development around\nthem, critics of left-libertarianism1 argue that it ignores\nimportant developments in economic conditions (see Anderson 2017)\nsince then. Others argue that this view of market forces ignores\ndevelopments in economic theory since then, in particular, that it is\ngrounded in a fallacious labour theory of value (Rothbard 1965 [2000],\nMurphy 2006).\n\nLeft-libertarians1 also argue that libertarian commitment\nto justice sit coherently alongside egalitarian commitments outside of\nthe narrow scope of justice. Whilst individual rights to maximal\nfreedom of action, association, and economic cooperation describe the\nmoral limits to the interpersonal use of force, there is much morality\nof social and political interest that lies beyond justice but which is\nnot entirely separable from justice (Johnson 2008, Christmas 2017).\nOpposition to sexism (Long & Johnson 2004), racism, nationalism,\net al, are often taken to be part of a full package of human\nemancipation. Whilst these commitments are not logically deduced from\na commitment to libertarian justice, they are grounded in similar\nfirst-order intuitions regarding egalitarian individualism (Christmas\n2019). Critics of this aspect of the view argue that the libertarian\nview on justice derives part of its value from its transcendence of,\nand compatibility with, a variety of other views about the good (Block\n2010).\n\nThis paradigm of left-libertarianism1 is distinguished from\na right-libertarianism1, that, whilst radical in a sense of\nbeing strongly demanding upon the status quo, regards fewer aspects of\nthe status quo as a normative problem.\nRight-libertarianism1 takes the structure of\nactually-existing capitalism to be a closer proxy of what a free\nmarket would look like. Right-libertarianism1 may also be\ntaken to be part of a thicker bundle of moral and social commitments,\nbut not ones associated with individual emancipation beyond the narrow\nscope of libertarian justice. On this view it is allied with social\nconservatism favouring cultural homogeneity/segregation, patriarchy,\nand inequality (so long as these things can be sustained voluntarily,\nand therefore in a way consistent with libertarian rights for all)\n(Feser 2010, Hoppe 2018).\n\nA figure in whom these dual tendencies of libertarianism can be viewed\nto play out is Murray Rothbard. An economist who also wrote\nextensively in history and philosophy, who swung between these radical\nand reactionary tendencies over his lifetime (see Massimino 2020). For\nlibertarianism to be fully understood it must be taken seriously in\nboth its radical leftist and its reactionary right-wing forms, as well\nas when it combines aspects of both tendencies (Tomasi & Zwolinski\n2023).\n\nNarrowly within the scope of distributive justice, libertarianism is\ndescribed as being left- or right-wing depending on whether it demands\nan egalitarian pattern of property rights in external resources. Both\nleft- and right-libertarians2 within this paradigm agree on\nself-ownership. The question arises over what constraints (if any)\nexist on what external resources self-owners can appropriate.\nLeft-libertarians2 countenance a principle demanding that\nexternal resources be equally distributed among self-owners, whereas\nright-libertarians2 do not. Though there is variance on the\nkinds of constraints right-libertarians2 place on\nacquisition, none of them demand equal holdings.\n\nAt one end of the spectrum sits the maximally permissive view of\noriginal appropriation. This view holds that that there are no\nquantitative constraints on the appropriation of unowned and unused\nresources. (Rothbard 1978, 1982, Narveson 1988, ch. 7, 1999, Feser\n 2005, Christmas 2020)\n Whilst there are particular procedures through which one must acquire\ninitially unowned (for example, making ostensive use of the resource\nin question), there is no limit on how much property this procedure\ncan be used to acquire. The initial non-ownership of the external\nworld drives this view.\n\nMost libertarians accept something like the so-called Lockean\nproviso. This proviso holds that appropriation is permissible if\n\u201cenough and as good\u201d be left for others. There\u2019s an\nextensive debate over how exactly this proviso is to be understood.\nNozick interprets the proviso to require that no individual be made\nworse off by a particular appropriation of a natural resource. But\nthis interpretation is problematic for at least two reasons. First,\nsuch a welfare-based constraint on the exercise of people\u2019s\nnatural right to appropriate seems ill-motivated within Nozick\u2019s\ntheory. In general, the exercise of our rights is not usually\nconstrained by a non-worsening requirement. Second, Nozick\u2019s\nproviso is vulnerable to the objection that, as long as property\nowners compensate non-owners only slightly over the pre-appropriation\nbaseline (which is likely quite low), non-owners are not wronged\n(Cohen 1995). This seems to permit what intuitively seems like a\nproblematically unequal outcome in which one person could appropriate\nall property, so long as they compensate everyone else by a tiny\namount. On such a view, private property seems to only function to\nproduce welfare rather than giving each individual a sphere of\nindependence.\n\nOthers interpret the Lockean proviso as requiring something like a\nsufficientarian requirement, such that people must have access to an\nadequate share of natural resources (Lomasky 1987; Wendt 2017). This\nview might invoke differing conceptions of adequacy, such as\nwell-being or the ability to be self-governing (Simmons 1992, 1993).\nOr one might see the proviso as ensuring the ability to exercise\none\u2019s rights of self-ownership. (Mack 1995) Or one might see is\nas grounding the right of necessity that has been a core part\nof the general natural rights tradition from Thomas Aquinas to Hugo\nGrotius (Christmas 2021c, pp. 51\u201354) These views converge\nclosely with the no-proviso view in that they articulate the inherent\nrestrictions within the power of acquisition which is grounded in our\noriginal rights. Nozick does not explain how the power of acquisition\nis grounded in our original rights, and hence posits the proviso as an\nexternal principle so that the power of acquisition is not entirely\nuntethered.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, left-libertarians2 argue\nthat the external world is not initially unowned in the sense\npresupposed above but is owned in some egalitarian manner. Therefore,\nany private acquisition of it is strongly constrained in some\negalitarian way.\n\nOne version of this view leans on the equal freedom principle of Kant\nand Spencer (see Steiner 1974). The argument is that self-ownership\ndepends upon some amount of world-ownership. If we do not have the\nright to locate our body at some location in space over time, we have\nno right to exist and therefore cannot be said to be self-owners\n(Steiner 2009, p. 241, also see Spencer 1851, ch. 9). The mere\nconceptual possibility of one person coming to own all the land is\nincoherent alongside the principle of universal self-ownership. Since\nwe must all equally be self-owners as far as is conceptually possible,\nand ownership of natural resources is essential to our being\nself-owners, to truly be self-owners we must all equally own the\nexternal world. This does not mean private appropriation cannot take\nplace, but it does mean that all private appropriations are encumbered\nwith a tax liability to compensate all others who may have privately\nappropriated less than you. Viewed this way,\nleft-libertarianism2 therefore intimately connects a\nuniversal basic income to self-ownership and freedom (Steiner\n2016).\n\nAn alternative version of the argument is leans more closely on the\nlabour-based justification of property found in Locke and others. The\nargument is that whilst all self-owners own their labor, and are\ntherefore entitled to recoup the full fruits thereof, the external,\nnatural world is not the result of anyone\u2019s labor. Therefore,\nwhen we produce objects of value by laboring upon natural resources,\nwe can only claim a portion of the value it has, namely, the portion\ncontributed by our own labor. The only person that can be said to be\nentitled the natural value found in nature is all of humanity.\nTherefore, all owners of private property must pay a tax against the\nvalue of the natural resources they own to compensate those who are\nexcluded from it, whilst still being able to recoup the value they\nadd. Viewed this way, left-libertarianism2 intimately\nconnects land-value taxation to self-ownership and freedom, and as\nsuch continues the legacy of Henry George (1897). This view is,\nhowever, subject the critiques of labor-mixing views of property and\nof the labor theory of value, noted above.\n\nThe debates one finds within luck-egalitarian approaches to\ndistributive justice over the nature of luck- and\nresponsibility-sensitivity, the measurement of freedom and of welfare,\nenter left-libertarian2 debates over the Lockean proviso.\nFor example, Michael Otsuka proposes a welfarist rather than a\nvalue-based metric of equality of ownership (2003).\n\nAs an exegetical interpretation of Locke\u2019s requirement that\nappropriators leave \u201cenough and as good\u201d, however,\nleft-libertarian2 views are implausible. In his discussion\nof appropriation, Locke invokes the idea of distributive shares only\nthree times (sections 31, 37, and 46). All appear in the context of\nthe (quite different) prohibition on letting things spoil. In these\ncases, and in these cases alone, Locke sees appropriation as taking\nwhat belongs to other particular people.\n\nLeft-libertarians2 often claim intuitive support for an\negalitarian proviso. When multiple people are presented with a\npreviously undivided resource, equal division is the intuitively fair\napproach. An objection, however, is that such intuitions apply only to\ncircumstances that ignore relevant conditions. For instance, while\nOtsuka (2018) is correct to claim that if two persons are stranded\ntogether on an island, equal division is the intuitive solution, this\nmay not be true if one person arrived earlier and had already\ncultivated, say, two-thirds of the island, while leaving more than\nenough for the second person to independently make a living, is\nwilling to cooperate, trade, and so on. In that case, the latecomer\ninsisting that she has a right to half the island is not only\ncounter-intuitive, but probably unjust. The intuition of equal\ndivision becomes even less appealing if we imagine more than two\nparties, capable of production, trade, and cooperation, arriving at\ndifferent times. It remains true, of course, that such latecomers will\nbe entitled to something like an equally good shot at making use of\nthe world\u2019s resources. What such an equally good shot comes to,\nhowever, is much less clear. Others argue that the respective\nintuitions behind egalitarian ownership of the world and individual\nself-ownership are strictly incoherent (Risse 2004).\n5. Anarchism and the State\n\nLibertarians are highly skeptical of political authority and state\nlegitimacy. Where a state is understood to be an agency with an\nexclusive right to lay down and enforce laws within a territory, it is\nnot clear how it could do this without either the consent of all\npeople subject to it, or by violating all of the rights of its\ncitizens. Of course, all states fail to satisfy this requirement for\nmost of their subjects (Spooner 1867, Simmons 1976, 1993). Many\nlibertarians embrace, at least philosophical, anarchism, and are\nthereby deeply suspicious of social contract theory. Philosophical\nanarchists believe that we have no duty to obey the laws of the state\nsimply because they come from the state. Some laws reflect natural\nmoral precepts like \u201cdo not murder or steal,\u201d and so we\nshould obey those laws because they happen to be just, but not because\nthe state has made them just. The implication of this is that\nthe state\u2019s enforcement of the rest of their body of law is\nillegitimate, and amounts to little more than a large group of armed\nagents imposing their will on non-consenting third parties.\n\nThe strongest version of the libertarian critique of the state\u2019s\nauthority is articulated by Lysander Spooner: the laws of the state\neither reflect natural justice and are therefore superfluous, or they\ncontravene natural justice, and are illegitimate (1882). Libertarians\nare not necessarily political anarchists in that they may\nbelieve justice is not served by directly attempting to abolish the\nstate (e.g., Simmons 2000, ch. 6), though many are (e.g. Chartier\n2012, ch. 6) Libertarian anarchists tend to be optimistic about the\npossibility of anarchic provision of justice, and of public goods, and\noffer sophisticated, if radical, accounts of how a just, stateless\nsociety could operate (Barnett 1986b, 2014 chs 7\u20139, Molinari\n1849, Rothbard 1978, ch. 12, Friedman 1989, pt. 2, Hoppe 2009, Huemer\n2012, chs 10\u201312, Chartier 2012, chs 3\u20135, Leeson 2014, Long\n2008b, Murphy 2008, Skoble 2008, Tannehill & Tannehill 1970, pt.\n2). The right-libertarian1 version of this theory is known\nas anarcho-capitalism whereas the left-libertarian1\nversion is known as left market anarchism.\n\nEssential to the libertarian view of the state is the moral parity\nthesis which says that individual state actors \u2013 and\ntherefore, states as composite actors \u2013 have the same rights and\nduties as private citizens (Brennan 2016b, 2019, 2021). Libertarians\ntherefore sharply differ from, for example, neo-Roman republicans and\nneo-Kantians in rejecting any fundamental distinction between public\nand private action. For libertarians, only a person\u2019s consent\ncan give you the right to do things to them that would ordinarily be\nrights-violations. The purportedly special moral status of acting in a\npublic capacity is not something that libertarians can reconcile with\nnatural equality (Long 1995, 2001 [Other Internet Resources],\nChristmas 2019).\n\nEven though libertarians are generally quite hostile to state\nauthority, this does not mean that the state cannot permissibly\nundertake certain minimal activities. After all, if all persons are\nentitled to defend rights, then the state may undertake such actions\nas well. It has the same permission to enforce individual rights as\nanyone else. However, it does not have any prima facie right to stop\nothers from doing this too. These activities do not presuppose any\nspecial authority since such activities are permissible with or\nwithout people\u2019s prior consent (unless, of course, such\nactivities involve the violation of rights themselves). However, no\nagency that engages in rights-protection could force anyone to pay for\nits protection, and hence could not legitimately exercise a tax power.\nWithout the right to tax and to hold an exclusive right to use force\nto protect rights, the state is really just a private agency like any\nother.\n\nRobert Nozick offered a controversial and subtle argument that a\nstate, with strictly curtailed domain of activity, could exist without\nanyone\u2019s rights being violated. It is often known as an\n\u201cinvisible hand argument\u201d for the state (1974, pt 1). In a\nsituation in which rights were enforced by a plethora of protective\nassociations, where each association protects the rights of those who\nvoluntarily chose to become members and pay fees, there would be a\nsignificant advantage in being a member of that protective association\nwith the most members within your territory. The more people who are\nin the same protective association as you, the more people you can\nhave peaceful, predictable, low risk social and economic interactions\nwith. For this reason, Nozick believed one protective association\nwould come to dominate the market for protection and would be a de\nfacto monopoly. Those who are not members of the association, if\nand when they enter a dispute over rights with a member, will have no\nother choice but to be subjected to the dominant associations\nprocedures for determining wrongdoing. Whilst the dominant association\ndoes not claim any exclusive right to administer all disputes, it is,\nby a matter of fact, the only agency administering disputes (Bader\n2021).\n\nWhen there is a plurality of competing associations, each particular\nassociation has an interest in cooperating with others when a dispute\narises between its respective members. However, when there is one\ndominant association, Nozick argues that it serves its members by\noutlawing new competitors, given that it would introduce alternative\nand most importantly risky procedures into its system of\nadministering justice. In coercively prohibiting new entrance into the\nprotection market, it enforces its monopoly, and thereby becomes a\nde jure monopoly and not a merely de facto one.\n\nMoreover, Nozick argues that this association can even charge fees to\nthose who do not voluntarily become members, so long as it provides\nthem with protection that provides protection to their rights that\nleaves their rights as protected or more protected than if they did\nnot. So, out of anarchy, a state emerges without violating\nanyone\u2019s rights. Of course, if the state engaged in any further\nactivities, for example, redistributing wealth in a way that was not\nstrictly necessary to the protection if rights, it would be\nviolating rights and would be illegitimate. This state is therefore\nreferred to as the \u201cminimal state\u201d.\n\nThere are reasons to think that when it comes to enforcing justice, it\nis important that there be an agency whose decision is final. This, is\na matter of fact, is going to be the one with the greatest capacity\nfor coercion. Some therefore believe states as such can have\nlegitimacy so long as they primarily use their unique capacity for\ncoercion to secure justice (Renzo 2011, Christmas 2022b).\n\nNozick\u2019s argument is a potentially strong one as it uses\nanarchist premises to argue that a state could in principle emerge\nthrough just steps. Note also that it applies to both\nright-libertarian2 and left-libertarian2\ntheories, on the latter the state is just enforcing a different\nset of rights over external objects.\n\nWhilst the argument is sophisticated, it has come under attack from a\nvariety of angles. Anarchists argue that a de facto monopoly would not\nbe just in using force to prohibit anyone else from forming a new\nprotective association. Therefore any de facto monopoly remains merely\nde facto and challengers to the state would always be justified in\nprotecting people\u2019s rights in alternative ways so long as they\nwere consistent with justice (Chartier 2011, pp. 257\u2013262). They\nalso argue that a de facto monopoly is less likely to be a faithful\nguarantor of justice and the possibility of external challenge is\nnecessary to safeguard justice (Long 2008b).\n\nNon-libertarian liberals argue that even if the argument is internally\ncoherent in terms of showing that a de jure monopoly could emerge\njustly, it does not yield a state that wields public power,\nbut only a form of overwhelming private power, such as the states of\nfeudal Europe (Freeman 2001, Anderson 2017). To be a legitimate\ngovernment, a state must exercise power over all on behalf of\nall, and not simply be a nexus of private contracts between\nindividuals.\n\nAn additional problem with the argument is that Nozick presents the\nminimal state as if it were the terminus of the invisible hand\nprocesses rather than a moment on a continuum. Whilst he insists that\nanarchy would not be a stable equilibrium and a minimal state would\nemerge, he does not attempt to show that a minimal state is a stable\nequilibrium. Once it has succeeded in having a justified monopoly on\nrights protection, it may well continue to extent its power,\ninfluence, and wealth beyond that which is necessary to secure\nindividuals\u2019 rights.\n\nRelatedly, Nozick argues that taxation is only justified to the extent\nthat it is necessary to fund the protection of rights. This is often\ntaken to mean that the state would be \u201csmall\u201d and its\ntaxes \u201clow\u201d. However, there is an important difference\nbetween minimalism in terms of the quality justificatory grounds of\nstate power, and minimalism in the actual quantitative size of the\nstate. It is possible that due to empirical circumstances, a state\nthat is limited to only protecting rights, and only taxing so much as\nto fund such activities, nonetheless requires a vast bureaucratic\napparatus. If this turns out to be the case, questions arise as to how\nsuch a large organization should be internally organized in order to\nensure its efficient functioning. It may require elements of\nbureaucracy and administrative discretion, as well as democracy and\nopen-access. Therefore, the size and structure of government is not\ndetermined a priori by its functions being limited to the protection\nof rights. Whilst the courts and the police are the morally necessary\noutputs of the state apparatus, we cannot know a priori what\norganizational complexities are necessary for their stable and\nefficient functioning. Whatever they are, they seem to be consistent\nwith the normative foundations of the minimal state (Murphy 2023).\nNon-ideal libertarian theorizing along these lines converges with\nneoliberalism, insofar as it recognizes a reasonably strong state as\ninstrumentally essential to the maintenance of a market-based social\norder (Vallier 2021).\n\nDemocratic theorists often argue that state authority holds that\nstates can be legitimate if they are democratic, libertarians tend to\nbe skeptical about this view. A large body of empirical findings has\nshown that voters tend to be radically uninformed, ignorant, and\nbiased about political issues. And democratic deliberation does\nlittle, if anything, to improve this. Indeed, it seems like it is\nrational for people to remain ignorant about politics. Given that\none\u2019s causal influence on the quality of political decisions is\nnegligible, and it is costly in terms of time and effort to become\ninformed, it is rational for people to remain ignorant. Most people\nthus vote in ways that have more to do with signaling their\nideological allegiance or virtues, and less with the merits of the\nissues (Caplan 2008, Somin 2016, Brennan 2016a, Pincione &\nTes\u00f3n 2011).\n\nIn addition to voter ignorance, many libertarians fear the more\ngeneral dynamics of state power. Public choice theory points out that\nsince the best way to understand the behavior of political agents is\nalong roughly maximizing lines, there is little reason to think that\nthe state will generally behave in the public interest (Tullock &\nBuchanan 1962). Thus, many government policies impose widely dispersed\ncosts on the populace to confer localized benefits on a few, often\npolitically well-connected elites. Examples include the large-scale\nbailouts of financial companies and agricultural subsidies.\n\nWhere libertarians view of democracy positively it will therefore be\ninstrumental in general, and agonistic in particular.\nDemocracy\u2019s value will be cashed out in terms of its role in\nlimiting the excessing power of the state, rather than in any\npurported intrinsic value of citizens sharing positive control over\ngovernment (Levy 2017). Democratic regimes, whilst far from ideal on a\nlibertarian standard, tend to have a far better track record of\nsupporting individual rights to socioeconomic liberty than any other\nregime. Whilst voters do not turn out to vote for candidates favouring\nlibertarian reforms per se, the overall effect of democratic\ninstitutions seems to be a liberalizing force on government and a\nconstraint on state excess, on this view of democracy (Levy 2018).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Alexander, L., 1996, \u201cThe Moral Magic of Consent,\u201d\n<em>Legal Theory</em>, 2: 165\u2013174.", "Anderson, E.S., 2017, <em>Private Government: How Employers Rule\nOur Lives (and Why We Don\u2019t Talk About it)</em>, Princeton, NJ:\nPrinceton University Press.", "Attas, D., 2006, \u201cFragmenting Property,\u201d <em>Law and\nPhilosophy</em>, 25: 119\u2013149.", "Aquinas, T., [1947] <em>Summa Theologica</em>, trans.
