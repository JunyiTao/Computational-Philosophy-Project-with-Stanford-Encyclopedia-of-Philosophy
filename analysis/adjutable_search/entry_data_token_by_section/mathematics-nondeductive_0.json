    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nPhilosophical views concerning the ontology of mathematics run the\ngamut from platonism (mathematics is about a realm of abstract\nobjects), to fictionalism (mathematics is a fiction whose subject\nmatter does not exist), to formalism (mathematical statements are\nmeaningless strings manipulated according to formal rules), with no\nconsensus about which is correct. By contrast, it seems fair to say\nthat there is a philosophically established received view of the basic\nmethodology of mathematics. Roughly, it is that mathematicians aim to\nprove mathematical claims of various sorts, and that proof consists of\nthe logical derivation of a given claim from axioms. This view has a\nlong history; thus Descartes writes in his Rules for the Direction\nof the Mind (1627\u201328) that a mathematical proposition must\nbe \u201cdeduced from true and known principles by the continuous and\nuninterrupted action of a mind that has a clear vision of each step in\nthe process\u201d (47). An important implication of this view is that\nthere is no room, at least ideally, in mathematics for non-deductive\nmethods. Frege, for example, states that \u201cit is in the nature of\nmathematics always to prefer proof, where proof is possible, to any\nconfirmation by induction\u201d (1884, 2). Berry (2016) offers a more\nrecent defense of proof as promoting key virtues of shared enquiry\nwithin the mathematical community.\n\nIn the philosophical literature, perhaps the most famous challenge to\nthis received view has come from Imre Lakatos, in his influential\n(posthumously published) 1976 book, Proofs and\nRefutations:\n\nEuclidean Methodology has developed a certain obligatory style of\npresentation. I shall refer to this as \u2018deductivist\nstyle\u2019. This style starts with a painstakingly stated list of\naxioms, lemmas and/or definitions. The axioms and\ndefinitions frequently look artificial and mystifyingly complicated.\nOne is never told how these complications arose. The list of axioms\nand definitions is followed by the carefully worded theorems.\nThese are loaded with heavy-going conditions; it seems impossible that\nanyone should ever have guessed them. The theorem is followed by the\nproof.\n\n\nIn deductivist style, all propositions are true and all inferences\nvalid. Mathematics is presented as an ever-increasing set of eternal,\nimmutable truths.\n\n\nDeductivist style hides the struggle, hides the adventure. The whole\nstory vanishes, the successive tentative formulations of the theorem\nin the course of the proof-procedure are doomed to oblivion while the\nend result is exalted into sacred infallibility (Lakatos 1976, 142).\n\n\nBefore proceeding, it will be worthwhile to make a few distinctions in\norder to focus the topics of subsequent discussion.\n",
