    "main_text": "Feyerabend\u2019s Turn to Philosophy: The Vienna Circle, Popper, and Wittgenstein || Early Contact with Wittgenstein (1948\u20131952)\n3.2 Early Contact with Wittgenstein (1948\u20131952)\n\nFeyerabend\u2019s principal intellectual engagement in the late 1940s\nand early 1950s was in his capacity as student leader of the\n\u201cKraft Circle\u201d. Viktor Kraft was a former member of the\nVienna Circle, and became Feyerabend\u2019s dissertation supervisor.\nThe Kraft Circle was a philosophy club centred around Kraft, which\nconstituted another part of the Austrian College Society. Bela Juhos,\nWalter Hollitscher, Georg Henrik von Wright, Elizabeth Anscombe and\nWittgenstein were all visiting speakers. Feyerabend reports that the\nCircle held meetings from 1949 to 1952 or 1953 (SFS, p. 109),\nthat they set themselves the task of \u201cconsidering philosophical\nproblems in a nonmetaphysical manner and with special reference to the\nfindings of the sciences\u201d (\u201cHerbert Feigl: A Biographical\nSketch\u201d, in P. K.Feyerabend & G.Maxwell (eds.), Mind,\nMatter, and Method: Essays in Philosophy and Science in Honor of\nHerbert Feigl, (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press,\n1966), pp. 1\u20132) and that their main topics of discussion were\nthe questions of the reality of theoretical entities and of the\n\u201cexternal world\u201d. About Wittgenstein\u2019s lecture,\nFeyerabend recalls the following: \n\nNot even a brief and quite interesting visit by Wittgenstein himself\n(in 1952) could advance our discussion. Wittgenstein was very\nimpressive in his way of presenting concrete cases, such as amoebas\nunder a microscope\u2026 but when he left we still did not know\nwhether or not there was an external world, or, if there was one, what\nthe arguments were in favour of it. (Feyerabend & Maxwell ibid.,\np. 4. Note that Feyerabend must have got the date wrong, since\nWittgenstein died in April 1951).\n\n\nWittgenstein, who took a long time to make up his mind and then\nappeared over an hour late gave a spirited performance and seemed to\nprefer our disrespectful attitude to the fawning admiration he\nencountered elsewhere. (SFS, p. 109).\n\n\nIn 1949, Feyerabend was introduced to Bertolt Brecht, and Hollitscher\noffered him the opportunity to become one of Brecht\u2019s production\nassistants, but he turned it down, later describing this as one of the\nbiggest mistakes of his life (SFS, p. 114). In the\nautobiography, however, he retracts this statement, saying that he\nwould not have enjoyed being part of the closely knit group that\nsurrounded Brecht. (The reasons for his later defection from the\nPopperian camp seem to have been similar). \n\nThe University of Vienna\u2019s physicists were Hans Thirring, Karl\nPrzibram, and Felix Ehrenhaft. Feyerabend admired Thirring and\nEhrenhaft, and was influenced by Ehrenhaft, who had lectured on\nphysics there from 1947. Ehrenhaft was known as a fierce and\nindependent critic of all kinds of orthodoxy in physics, but was\nsometimes thought of as a charlatan. Feyerabend reports that he and\nhis fellow science students looked forward to exposing him as a fraud,\nbut in fact were treated, at the 1949 Alpbach seminar, to a battle\nbetween Ehrenhaft and the orthodox in which the former presented his\nexperiments but the latter defended their position by using strategies\nwhich Galileo\u2019s opponents would have been proud of, ridiculing\nEhrenhaft\u2019s phenomena as mere Dreckeffects. Feyerabend\ncommented that \u201cOnly much later did Ehrenhaft\u2019s lesson\nsink in and our attitude at the time as well as the attitude of the\nentire profession provided me then with an excellent illustration of\nthe nature of scientific rationality\u201d (SFS, p. 111).\nEhrenhaft did not convince the theoreticians, who protected themselves\nwith an iron curtain of dogmatic belief of exactly the same kind as\nthat deployed by Galileo\u2019s opponents. His audience remained\nstaunch empiricists, never doubting that science had to be adapted to\nfacts. Feyerabend commented that the day-to-day business of science,\nwhat Thomas Kuhn called \u201cnormal science\u201d, cannot exist\nwithout this kind of \u201csplit consciousness\u201d.\n\nAt the University of Vienna, although he had originally planned to\nsubmit a thesis on physics, Feyerabend swapped to philosophy when he\ngot nowhere with the electrodynamics problem he was calculating (the\nphilosopher of science as failed scientist?). He completed his\ndoctoral thesis, \u201cZur Theorie der\nBasiss\u00e4tze\u201d in 1951 under Kraft\u2019s supervision.\nThe subject of the thesis was \u201cbasic sentences\u201d, or\n\u201cprotocol sentences\u201d, i.e. the kind of sentences that, the\nLogical Positivists had theorised, comprise the foundations of\nscientific knowledge. He later reported that in his philosophical work\nhe had \u201cstarted from and returned to the discussion of protocol\nstatements in the Vienna Circle\u201d (\u201cConcluding\nUnphilosophical Conversation\u201d, in Mun\u00e9var (1991), p.\n526). This is unsurprising, given that Kraft was then the Vienna\nCircle\u2019s only survivor in Vienna. However, Kraft\u2019s\ninfluence on Feyerabend has only recently been emphasised. Much of the\nmaterial from Feyerabend\u2019s thesis was presented at (or gleaned\nfrom) meetings of the Kraft Circle, and also appears in his early\narticles, such as \u201cAn Attempt at a Realistic Interpretation of\nExperience\u201d (1958). The thesis itself was \u201ca condensed\nversion of the discussions in the Kraft Circle\u201d (p. 115).\n\nIn the early 1950\u2019s, Feyerabend published several German papers\non Wittgenstein, written as a result of having read the proofs of the\nPhilosophical Investigations, lent to him by Elizabeth\nAnscombe. Feyerabend first met Anscombe when lecturing on Descartes to\nthe Austrian College Society. Anscombe had come to Vienna to perfect\nher German in order to translate Wittgenstein\u2019s works.\n\nShe gave me manuscripts of Wittgenstein\u2019s later writings and\ndiscussed them with me. The discussions extended over months and\noccasionally proceeded from morning over lunch until late into the\nevening. They had a profound influence upon me though it is not at all\neasy to specify particulars. (SFS, p. 114).\n\n\nFeyerabend planned to study with Wittgenstein in Cambridge, and\nWittgenstein was prepared to take him on as a student, but he died\nbefore Feyerabend arrived in England. Karl Popper became his\nsupervisor instead. \n",
