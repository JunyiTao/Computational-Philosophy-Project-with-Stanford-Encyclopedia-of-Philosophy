    "main_text": "The Problem: Who Should be Elected?\n1. The Problem: Who Should be Elected? \n\nSuppose that there is a group of 21 voters who need to make a decision\nabout which of four candidates should be elected. Let the names of the\ncandidates be \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\) and \\(D\\). Your job, as a social\nplanner, is to determine which of these 4 candidates should win the\nelection given the opinions of all the voters. The first step\nis to elicit the voters\u2019 opinions about the candidates. Suppose that\nyou ask each voter to rank the 4 candidates from best to worst (not\nallowing ties). The following table summarizes the voters\u2019 rankings of\nthe candidates in this hypothetical election scenario. \n\n\n\n# VotersRanking\n3\\(A\\s B\\s C\\s D\\)\n5\\(A\\s C\\s B\\s D\\)\n7\\(B\\s D\\s C\\s A\\)\n6\\(C\\s B\\s D\\s A\\)\n\n\nRead the table as follows: Each row represents a ranking for a group of voters\nin which candidates to the left are ranked higher. The numbers in the first column\n indicate the number of voters with that particular\nranking. So, for example, the third row in the table indicates that\n7 voters have the ranking \\(B\\s D\\s C\\s A\\) which means that each of the 7 voters \nrank \\(B\\) first, \\(D\\) second, \\(C\\) third and \\(A\\) last.\nSuppose that, as the social planner, you do not have any personal\ninterest in the outcome of this election. Given the voters\u2019 expressed\nopinions, which candidate should win the election? Since the voters\ndisagree about the ranking of the candidates, there is no obvious\ncandidate that best represents the group\u2019s opinion. If there were\nonly two candidates to choose from, there is a very straightforward\nanswer: The winner should be the candidate or alternative that is supported\nby more than 50 percent of the voters (cf. the discussion below about\nMay\u2019s Theorem in Section 4.2). However, if there are more than two\ncandidates, as in the above example, the statement \u201cthe\ncandidate that is supported by more than 50 percent of the\nvoters\u201d can be interpreted in different ways, leading to\ndifferent ideas about who should win the election. \n\nOne candidate who, at first sight, seems to be a good choice to win\nthe election is \\(A\\). Candidate \\(A\\) is ranked first by more voters\nthan any other candidate. (\\(A\\) is ranked first by 8 voters,\n\\(B\\) is ranked first by 7; \\(C\\) is ranked first by 6; and\n\\(D\\) is not ranked first by any of the voters.) Of course, 13 people\nrank \\(A\\) last. So, while more voters rank \\(A\\) first than\nany other candidate, more than half of the voters rank \\(A\\) last.\nThis suggests that \\(A\\) should not be elected. \n\nNone of the voters rank \\(D\\) first. This fact alone does not rule out\n\\(D\\) as a possible winner of the election. However, note that\nevery voter ranks candidate \\(B\\) above candidate \\(D\\). While this\ndoes not mean that \\(B\\) should necessarily win the election, it does\nsuggest that \\(D\\) should not win the election. \n\nThe choice, then, boils down to \\(B\\) and \\(C\\). It turns out that  there are good\narguments for each of \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) to be elected. The debate about\nwhich of \\(B\\) or \\(C\\) should be elected started in the 18th-century\nas an argument between the two founding fathers of voting theory,\nJean-Charles de Borda (1733\u20131799) and M.J.A.N. de Caritat,\nMarquis de Condorcet (1743\u20131794). For a history of voting theory\nas an academic discipline, including Condorcet\u2019s and Borda\u2019s writings,\nsee McLean and Urken (1995). I sketch the intuitive arguments for the\nelection of \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) below.\n\nCandidate \\(C\\) should win. Initially, this might seem like\nan odd choice since both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) receive more first place\nvotes than \\(C\\) (only 6 voters rank \\(C\\)  first while 8 voters  rank \\(A\\) \nfirst  and 7 voters  rank \\(B\\) first). However, note \nhow the population would vote in the various two-way elections comparing \n\\(C\\) with each of the other candidates: \n\n\n# Voters\\(C\\) versus \\(A\\)\n\\(C\\) versus \\(B\\)\n\\(C\\) versus \\(D\\)\n\n3\\(\\bA\\s \\gB\\s \\bC\\s \\gD\\)\n\\(\\gA\\s \\bB\\s \\bC\\s \\gD\\)\n\\(\\gA\\s \\gB\\s \\bC\\s \\bD\\)\n\n5\\(\\bA\\s  \\bC\\s \\gB\\s \\gD\\)\n\\(\\gA\\s  \\bC\\s \\bB\\s \\gD\\)\n\\(\\gA\\s  \\bC\\s \\gB\\s \\bD\\)\n\n7\\(\\gB\\s \\gD\\s  \\bC\\s \\bA\\)\n\\(\\bB\\s \\gD\\s  \\bC\\s \\gA\\)\n\\(\\gB\\s \\bD\\s  \\bC\\s \\gA\\)\n\n6\\( \\bC\\s \\gB\\s \\gD\\s \\bA\\)\n\\( \\bC\\s \\bB\\s \\gD\\s \\gA\\)\n\\( \\bC\\s \\gB\\s \\bD\\s \\gA\\)\n\nTotals:\n13 rank \\(C\\) above \\(A\\)8 rank \\(A\\) above \\(C\\)\n11 rank \\(C\\) above \\(B\\)10 rank \\(B\\) above \\(C\\)\n14 rank \\(C\\) above \\(D\\)7 rank \\(D\\) above \\(C\\)\n\n\n\nCondorcet\u2019s idea is that \\(C\\) should be declared the winner since she beats\nevery other candidate in a one-on-one election. A candidate with this\nproperty is called a Condorcet winner. We can similarly define\na Condorcet loser. In fact, in the above example, candidate\n\\(A\\) is the Condorcet loser since she loses to every other candidate\nin  a one-on-one election.\n\nCandidate \\(B\\) should win. Consider \\(B\\)\u2019s performance in\nthe one-on-one elections. \n\n\n# Voters\\(B\\) versus \\(A\\)\n\\(B\\) versus \\(C\\)\n\\(B\\) versus \\(D\\)\n\n3\\(\\bA\\s \\bB\\s \\gC\\s \\gD\\)\n\\(\\gA\\s \\bB\\s \\bC\\s \\gD\\)\n\\(\\gA\\s \\bB\\s \\gC\\s \\bD\\)\n\n5\\(\\bA\\s  \\gC\\s \\bB\\s \\gD\\)\n\\(\\gA\\s  \\bC\\s \\bB\\s \\gD\\)\n\\(\\gA\\s  \\gC\\s \\bB\\s \\bD\\)\n\n7\\(\\bB\\s \\gD\\s  \\gC\\s \\bA\\)\n\\(\\bB\\s \\gD\\s  \\bC\\s \\gA\\)\n\\(\\bB\\s \\bD\\s  \\gC\\s \\gA\\)\n\n6\\( \\gC\\s \\bB\\s \\gD\\s \\bA\\)\n\\( \\bC\\s \\bB\\s \\gD\\s \\gA\\)\n\\( \\gC\\s \\bB\\s \\bD\\s \\gA\\)\n\nTotals:\n13 rank \\(B\\) above \\(A\\)8 rank \\(A\\) above \\(B\\)\n10 rank \\(B\\) above \\(C\\)11 rank \\(C\\) above \\(B\\)\n21 rank \\(B\\) above \\(D\\)0 rank \\(D\\) above \\(B\\)\n\n\n\nCandidate \\(B\\) performs the same as \\(C\\) in a head-to-head election\nwith \\(A\\), loses to \\(C\\) by only one vote and beats \\(D\\) in a\nlandslide (everyone prefers \\(B\\) over \\(D\\)). Borda suggests that we should\ntake into account all of these facts when determining which\ncandidate best represents the overall group opinion.   To do this, Borda \nassigns a score to each candidate that reflects  how much support he or she has \namong the electorate. Then, the\ncandidate with the largest score is declared the winner. One way to\ncalculate the score for each candidate is as follows (I will give an\nalternative method, which is easier to use, in the next section): \n\n\\(A\\) receives 24 points (8 votes in each of the three\nhead-to-head elections)\n\\(B\\) receives 44 points (13 points in the competition against\n\\(A\\), plus 10 in the competition against \\(C\\) plus 21 in the\ncompetition against \\(D\\))\n\\(C\\) receives 38 points (13 points in the competition against\n\\(A\\), plus 11 in the competition against \\(B\\) plus 14 in the\ncompetition against \\(D\\))\n\\(D\\) receives 20 points (13 points in the competition against\n\\(A\\), plus 0 in the competition against \\(B\\) plus 7 in the\ncompetition against \\(C\\))\n\n\nThe candidate with the highest score (in this case, \\(B\\)) is the one\nwho should be elected. \nBoth Condorcet and Borda suggest comparing candidates in\none-on-one elections in order to determine the winner. While Condorcet\ntallies how many of the head-to-head races each candidate wins, Borda\nsuggests that one should look at the margin of victory or loss.   \nThe debate about whether to elect the Condorcet winner or the Borda\nwinner is not settled. Proponents of electing the Condorcet winner\ninclude Mathias Risse (2001, 2004, 2005) and Steven Brams (2008);\nProponents of electing the Borda winner include Donald Saari (2003,\n2006) and Michael Dummett (1984).   See Section 3.1.1\nfor further issues comparing the Condorcet and Borda winners. \n\n\nThe take-away message from this discussion is that in many election\nscenarios with more than two candidates, there may not always be one\nobvious candidate that best reflects the overall group opinion. The\nremainder of this entry will discuss different methods, or procedures,\nthat can be used to determine the winner(s) given the a group of\nvoters\u2019 opinions. Each of these methods is intended to be an answer to\nthe following question: \n\nGiven a group of people faced with some decision, how should a central\nauthority combine the individual opinions so as to best reflect the\n\u201coverall group opinion\u201d?\n\n\nA complete analysis of this question would incorporate a number of\ndifferent issues ranging from central topics in political philosophy\nabout the nature of democracy and the \u201cwill of the people\u201d\nto the psychology of decision making. In this article, I focus on one\naspect of this question: the formal analysis of algorithms that aggregate \nthe  opinions of a group  of  voters (i.e., voting methods).  Consult, for \nexample, Riker 1982, Mackie 2003, and Christiano 2008 for a more comprehensive \nanalysis of the above question, incorporating many of the issues raised in \nthis article. \n",
