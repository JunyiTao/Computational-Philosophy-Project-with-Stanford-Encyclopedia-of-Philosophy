Ernst Mach famously reported\nstepping onto a bus and noticing a man who looked like a shabby\npedagogue. In fact, he was seeing himself in a large mirror at the far\nend of the bus (Mach 1914). Conversely, if we see a broken arm, we can\nmistake it for our own, although it is another person\u2019s arm that\nis mixed up with ours (Wittgenstein 1958). On the basis of such\nexamples, it is said that no judgement based on external senses is\nimmune to error through misidentification. There is a gap between\nvisually knowing that a body is F and visually knowing that it\nis my own body that is F. Consequently, when people discuss\nbodily awareness, they rarely mean the visual awareness one can have\nof one\u2019s body.\n\nSome, however, are opposed to such a contrast between external senses\nand body senses. For instance, the psychologist Gibson (1979) argues\nthat even while looking at the external world, our visual experiences\ncarry information about our own body: \n\n\nI maintain that all the perceptual systems are propriosensitive as\nwell as exterosensitive, for they all provide information in their\nvarious ways about the observer\u2019s activities\u2026 Information\nthat is specific to the self is picked up as such, no matter what\nsensory nerve is delivering impulses to the brain. (Gibson 1979: 115)\n\n\n\nThe fact is that when I have the visual experience of a tree in front\nof me, I cannot have the following doubt: \u201csomeone is standing\nin front of a tree, but is it I?\u201d (Evans 1982: 222). Evans\nconcludes that visual experiences of the external world from an\negocentric perspective guarantee the IEM of self-locating judgments\n(Cassam 1995; Berm\u00fadez 1998; Peacocke 2012; Schwenkler 2014).\nLikewise, one may argue that visual experiences of the body\ncould also guarantee IEM in some ecologically valid situations (Evans\n1982: 220 fn 26; Peacocke 2012).\nProprioception guarantees bodily IEM because of some biological facts\nabout the human body (i.e., the proprioceptive neural system is\nconnected only to one\u2019s own body). In the same vein, one may\nsuggest that there are some other basic biological facts that secure\nthe link between certain visual contents and one\u2019s own body. For\ninstance, I can see my nose if I close one eye and I cannot doubt that\nthis is my own nose when I see it from this specific angle. \n\nThe fact that the inside mode exclusively results from body senses,\nwith no influence from external senses, has also been questioned by\nrecent empirical evidence (Stein & Meredith 1993; Ernst 2006; van\nBeers et al. 1999; Welch & Warren 1980). Information from one\nmodality can affect information in another modality. Multisensory\neffects occur very early on in sensory processing and they are often\nautomatic and mandatory. Consequently, the \u2018normal\u2019 way of\ngaining bodily self-knowledge is not on the basis of body senses only,\nbut rather on the basis of their integration with vision. Take the\nrubber hand illusion, which results from the incorrect integration of\nsomatosensory information and visual information about the rubber\nhand. It induces not only a sense of ownership for the rubber hand,\nbut also proprioceptive drift (i.e., one mislocalizes one\u2019s hand\nin the direction of the location of the rubber hand) and referred\nsensation of touch (i.e., one feels touch on the rubber hand). It can\nbe explained by three major facts about the sensory systems. First,\noptimal estimates of bodily properties require combination of\ninformation from various sensory channels. Second, vision can dominate\nover proprioception and touch because it often offers more accurate\nand precise spatial information. Third, visual information can affect\nthe phenomenal content of bodily experiences. What we feel is\ndetermined not only by information from body senses, but also by\ninformation from external senses. Our access to the intrinsic\nproperties of our body is also partly based on vision. Although\nO\u2019Shaughnessy (1989: 56) claims that that our body image is\nnothing more than a collection of information from body senses, it has\nbeen found that blind individuals have a less accurate representation\nof the size of their body parts compared to sighted individuals\n(Kinsbourne & Lempert 1980: 37). The fact is that vision is the\nonly sensory modality that can directly and reliably (though not\nperfectly) process size information (Longo & Haggard 2010). As\nconcluded by the neurologist Schilder (1935: 38) a long time before\nmultisensory research had started to take off: \n\n\nIt is not the case that the schema of the body has two different\nparts, the one optic and the other tactile. It is in essence a\nsynaesthesia (\u2026) The synaesthesia, therefore, is the normal\nsituation.\n\n\nThe notion of multimodality has become of interest to philosophers\nonly recently (Bennett and Hill, 2014; O\u2019Callaghan 2020).\nUnfortunately, there is already little agreement in philosophy on the\nway to individuate the modalities themselves, let alone on how to\nunderstand multimodality. One crucial question is whether these\nmultisensory effects show that vision plays only a causal\nrole in fixing the spatial content of bodily experiences or whether\nbodily experiences are constitutively multimodal (Vignemont\n2014). One may also ask whether some features can be represented only\nthanks to multisensory integration (Briscoe forthcoming). A final\nquestion is whether multimodality comes at the cost of bodily IEM. If\nbodily self-ascriptions are grounded not only in the body senses,\nwhich secure IEM, but also in vision, which does not always guarantee\nIEM, then can one still claim that bodily self-ascriptions are immune\nto error?\n",
