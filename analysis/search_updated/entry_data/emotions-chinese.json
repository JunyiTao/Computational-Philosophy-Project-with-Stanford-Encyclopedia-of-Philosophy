    "preamble": "\n\nIn many schools of Western philosophy and psychology, emotions are\nunderstood as inner subjective feelings that are sharply contrasted\nwith the intellectual faculties of the mind. In Chinese philosophy,\nhowever, emotions are not fully explained by inner subjective feelings\nor inexplicable passions. Rather, they are understood as interactive,\nresponsive, and holistic affectivity that plays broad psychological,\ncognitive, and moral roles in one\u2019s understanding of the world\n(its objective reality, nature of things, and their situations and\ncircumstances) and one\u2019s dispositions and reactions to external\nstimulation. The present essay discusses the diverse conceptual\ndimensions, psychological orientations and moral significance of\nemotions discussed in major philosophical texts of ancient China from\nthe early sixth to the late first centuries BCE. Specifically, it\nfocuses on how early Chinese philosophers explained the nature of\nemotions and how they identified and categorized emotions. The essay\nconsists of the following sections. First, general philosophical\norientations of Chinese philosophy will be compared and contrasted\nwith Western approaches to emotions. Second, early Chinese notions of\nemotions will be identified through the lens of qing (\u60c5), a\nunique Chinese notion of affectivity (or onto-affectivity) that\nincludes such semantic elements as essence, nature, reality,\ndisposition, desire, and feelings. Third, the philosophical\ninterpretations and the semantic dimensions of qing in early\nChinese philosophy will be discussed. Fourth, terms and lists of\nemotions in early Chinese texts will be analyzed to illustrate how\nChinese philosophers categorized and individuated emotions. Fifth,\nearly Chinese philosophical texts and their theories of emotions will\nbe surveyed to explain how emotions and the broad domains of the\naffective mind (such as innate dispositions, psychological\ninclinations, subjective feelings, and desires) are discussed in\nancient Chinese texts.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Emotions, Affective Sensitivity, and Chinese Philosophy\n1.1 Emotions in Western Philosophy and Psychology\n\nIn Western philosophy and psychology, emotions are defined as inner\npsychological states with subjective feelings that are contrasted with\ncognitive states and processes of the mind. If one believes that\n\u20181+1=2\u2019, this cognitive state, in itself, does not come\nwith particular feelings, motivate specific actions, or facilitate\nobservable embodied expressions. Nor does it draw any evaluative\njudgments. Regardless of one\u2019s feelings or motivations, one can\nsimply believe that \u20181+1=2\u2019 is true. In addition, emotions\nare often associated with strong desires or passions that can conflict\nwith rational reasoning and reflective thinking. In his\nRepublic (Book IV), Plato argues that the soul\n(psyche) consists of three distinctive components, reason\n(logistikon), spirit (thumoeides), and appetite\n(epithumetikon). He puts reason against the affective\ncomponents of the mind. Stoic philosophers characterized emotions as\ninexplicable passion, uncontrollable urge, or irrational fear.\nAccording to Arius Didymus (a Stoic philosopher of the early Roman\nEmpire), emotional states are \u201cexcessive impulses which are\ndisobedient to reason\u201d (translated in Pomeroy 1999: 65A).\nDescartes (1649 [1989: 385]) believed that passion is internal\ndispositions and tendencies moved by external events that can go\nagainst rational understanding of the world. Although recent\npublications demonstrate strong academic interest in emotions in\nWestern philosophy and psychology (Damasio 1994; De Sousa 1987;\nGibbard 1990; Haidt 2001; Lutz 1988; Nichols 2004; Nussbaum 2001;\nPrinz 2004; Solomon 1984), emotions are still understood from the viewpoints of\nsubjectivity, phenomenality, motivation, passion and desire. \n1.2 Emotions in Chinese Philosophy\n\nIn Chinese philosophy, however, emotions are not necessarily or fully\nunderstood as subjective feelings. Nor is it characterized as an\nirrational or excessive urge of passion that disrupts or challenges\nrational thinking. Instead, emotions play broad psychological and\nmoral roles in the cultivation of virtue and the political order and\nstability of society. From this unique Chinese perspective, one can\nunderstand that one\u2019s affective interaction with the personal,\nsocial, and physical environments constitutes one\u2019s moral agency\nand an essential property of the interdependent and communal self. For\nexample, Confucius states that the duty of serving one\u2019s parents\n(filial piety) has no meaning if one does not have genuine affection\ntoward one\u2019s parents (Analects, 2.7) and ritual\npropriety becomes a blind rule following behavior if one does not have\ncaring heart for others (Analects, 3.3). Mozi (Mozi,\n13.1) states that a ruler cannot govern his or her state successfully\nwithout understanding the affective dispositions and circumstances of\npeople. That is, emotions are not simply inner subjective feelings but\ninteractive, perceptual, cognitive, motivational, and affective states\nof the mind in their constant dealings with the world that in itself\nis affectively constituted and embedded. As Vir\u00e1g (2017: 194)\nstates, emotions in early Chinese philosophy \u201cdid not simply\nrepresent the individual realm of subjective experience\u201d but\nconstitute \u201cthe crucial interface between self and the world,\nmind and cosmos\u201d. Cheng (2001: 79) captures this holistic and\ninteractive viewpoint with a broad notion of the mind in Chinese\nphilosophy. \n\n\nMind is not simply an intellectual entity or a mechanism for thinking\nor reasoning. It is rather an inter-linked entity of sensibility,\nfeeling, awareness, thinking and willing as testified by common\nexperience of reflective subjectivity of the self-identified as the\n\u201cI\u201d. \n\n\nTherefore, emotions, in Chinese philosophy, are understood as the\nholistic affectivity of the sensing, thinking, and feeling mind that\nis always related to and interactive with the world.\n1.3 Qing and Chinese Philosophy\n\nAt the center of this broad, interactive, and holistic understanding\nof the mind and emotions in Chinese philosophical traditions, one can\nobserve a unique notion of qing (\u60c5). Qing is\ncommonly understood, in modern Chinese, as affective states of the\nmind but, in classical Chinese philosophy, it is neither contrasted\nwith cognitive states nor distinguished from intellectual functions of\nthe mind (Marchal 2013; Perkins 2002; Wong 1991). Specifically, in\nearly Chinese philosophy, qing refers to a broad category of\nobjective properties of the world and their interaction with the mind\nresulting in diverse forms of psychological states such as feelings,\nmotivations, desires and hopes. It means nature, essence, reality,\nsituations, and circumstances, as well as affective dispositions and\ninteractive reactions (Bruya 2003; Eifring 2004b; Graham 1990;\nHarbsmeier 2004; Hansen 1995; Puett 2004; Seok 2013).\nQing\u2019s broad semantic scope can be summarized as\none\u2019s concrete understanding of the world, living sense of\nreality, and realization of the interdependent and interactive self\nthat resonates with others and their circumstances. That is,\nqing is not simply subjective feelings that resides in a\nprivate, solipsistic mind but a comprehensive mode of one\u2019s\nconative, cognitive, intentional and embodied dealings with the\nworld.\n\nMany Chinese philosophers discuss qing and its interactive\nresponsiveness and affective sensitivity as a core foundation of moral\nagency and the communal self. Confucius explains that the virtue of\nren (benevolence, compassion) is based on one\u2019s love\nfor others (one\u2019s other-caring emotion) and xiao\n(filial piety) comes out of one\u2019s genuine feeling for\none\u2019s parents (Analects, 2.7, 3.3). Mozi talks about\nimpartial caring (jian ai) (Mozi, 16.2). Laozi asks\nfor loving kindness and non-contention toward others (Laozi,\n67, 68) and Zhuangzi focuses on our inborn nature and spontaneous\naffective dispositions (Zhuangzi, 24.1). Mencius\u2019s four\nmoral sprouts (siduan \u56db\u7aef) are innate emotional\ninclinations deeply rooted in the moral mind (Mencius 2A6).\nXunzi\u2019s discussion of self-cultivation through ritual and music\nfocuses on the affective and interactive sensitivity of the mind\n(Xunzi, Chs. 19, 20; Sung 2012; Wang 2015). The same affective\napproach to the mind and morality can be witnessed in Neo-Confucian\nphilosophy and contemporary Chinese philosophy, for example, in Zhu\nXi\u2019s discussion of Mencius\u2019s moral sprouts\n(siduan) (Marchal 2013; Zhu 2011) and Wang Yangming\u2019s\ndiscussion of xin (\u5fc3the heart-mind) and liangzhi\n(moral awareness or conscience) (Lu 2019; Wang 1963). In his theory of emotion\nas foundational substance (qing benti lun \u60c5\u672c\u9ad4\u8ad6), a\nrenowned contemporary Chinese philosopher Li Zehou (1998) takes\nqing as the foundational substance (benti \u672c\u9ad4) of\nmorality and humanity.\n2. Emotions and Qing in Early Chinese Philosophy\n2.1 Emotions and Qing\n\nMany psychologists and philosophers report that emotions have\nparticular psychological properties such as phenomenology,\nintentionality, motivation, embodiment, and appraisal (Charland 2002;\nFehr & Russell 1984; Goldie 2002; Russell 1980). For example,\none\u2019s emotional state of anger against unfair discrimination can\nbe explained by one\u2019s feeling (distress, frustration),\nintentionality (unfair discrimination), motivation (complaint,\nprotest), embodiment (rapid heartbeat, high blood pressure), and\nappraisal (oppose, dislike). An emotional state, therefore, is a\npsychological complexity consisting of multidimensional or\nmultifactorial processes of the mind. On the basis of these\npsychological properties, one can easily understand Blackburn\u2019s\n(1996: 117) definition:\n\n\nThe typical human emotions include love, grief, fear, anger, joy. Each\nindicates a state of some kind of arousal, a state that can prompt\nsome activities and interfere with others. These states are associated\nwith characteristic feelings, and they have characteristic bodily\nexpressions.\n\n\nIn the Liji (\u79ae\u8a18 the Book of Rites), one of\nConfucian classics, one can find comparable categories (such as joy,\nanger, and love) and characteristics (such as feeling, arousal, and\nactivity) of emotions:\n\n\nWhat are the feelings [qing] of men? They are joy, anger,\nsadness, fear, love, disliking, and liking. These seven feelings\nbelong to men without their learning them. (Liji, 9.18; Legge\n1885a: 379)\n\nBefore the feelings of pleasure, anger, sorrow, and joy are aroused it\nis called equilibrium (chung [zhong], centrality,\nmean). When these feelings are aroused and each and all attain due\nmeasure and degree, it is called harmony. (Liji, 31.1;\nZhongyong, 1; Chan 1963: 98)\n\n\nIt seems that ancient Chinese notions of qing and feelings\nare comparable with the Western psychological categories and\ncharacterizations of emotions as illustrated in Blackburn\u2019s\ndefinition and the passages of the Liji. In many ancient\nChinese texts, however, this similarity does not hold. Qing\ndoes not always refer to inner feelings or emotional states. It refers\nto many different things, some of which have little to do with inner\npsychological states.\n2.2 Meanings of Qing\n\nQing, in modern Chinese, means emotions and subjective\nfeelings. \u611f\u60c5 (ganqing) means feeling and \u60c5\u7eea\n(qingxu) means affective mood. In early Chinese texts in the\npre-Han (500 to 200 BCE) period, however, the term qing does\nnot always refers to emotional states of the mind. It can mean real\nfacts, truth, or essence that does not seem to have any relation to\ninner subjective states of the mind. Graham (1990: 59\u201365) argues\nthat, in pre-Han literature, qing should not be understood as\n\u201cpassions\u201d. Instead, it should be understood as \u201cthe\nfacts\u201d or what is \u201cgenuine\u201d. Although in some texts,\nthe Xunzi, for instance, qing is used in the\ncontexts of feelings and emotions, in other texts, such as the\nMozi and the Sunzi bingfa (\u5b6b\u5b50\u5175\u6cd5 the Art\nof War), it means essence, nature, genuineness, situation, and\nreality with little semantic affinity to emotions or subjective\nfeelings. For this reason, many sinologists and comparative\nphilosophers (Bruya 2003; Eifring 2004b; Graham 1990; Hansen 1995;\nHarbsmeier 2004; Middendorf 2008; Puett 2004; Vir\u00e1g 2017)\ndiscuss the polysemy of qing in early Chinese texts and\nanalyze its peculiar patterns of emergence and development in the\npre-Han period. Regarding the meaning of qing in pre-Han\ntexts, Graham (1990: 59) states that \u201cAs a noun it\n[qing] means \u2018the facts\u2019\u2026, as an adjective\n\u2018genuine\u2019\u2026, as an adverb\n\u2018genuinely\u2019\u201d. By following Graham\u2019s (1990)\ninterpretation of qing, Eifring (2019: 190) develops a\nnon-psychological interpretation of qing (i.e., qing\nas nature, essence, or genuineness) in pre-Han Confucian and Daoist\ntexts. He states that \n\n\nqing is hardly used in the sense of \u2018emotion\u2019 at\nall\u2026The term itself has a number of different meanings, most of\nthem clearly related, and when the meaning \u2018emotion\u2019\ngradually emerges, some of these meanings still continue to vibrate\nalong, suggesting that emotions are genuine and that they belong to\nhuman nature. \n\n\nFollowing the same line of interpretation, Ivanhoe and Van Norden\n(2001: 391) define qing as \u201c\u2018the genuine\u2019,\n\u2018essence\u2019, or \u2018disposition\u2019\u201d. They state\nthat \n\n\nThe qing of something is what it genuinely is, as opposed to\nwhat it might appear to be. This is often conceived of in terms of how\nit would spontaneously behave and develop if given a proper\nenvironment and support. More specifically, some interpreters have\nargued that the qing of a thing can be the essential\ncharacteristics of that thing. Toward the end of the Warring States\nperiod, qing came to refer to human emotions or dispositions\n(perhaps because some thinkers regarded these as essential to human\nbeings). \n\n\nAdding more semantic details, Santangelo (2007: 296) states that the\nmost common Chinese term, qing is \n\n\na polysemous word that basically means: \u201cfeeling or affective\nstate of mind\u201d, \u201cinclination or desire\u201d,\n\u201ccircumstances\u201d, \u201cauthenticity\u201d. Even if we\nconsider the most common terms that are usually translated into\nEnglish as \u201cemotion\u201d, qinggan or\nganqing, in fact they express a semantic space different from\nthe English or Italian equivalents. \n\n\nAs these interpretations and reports show, qing, unlike the\ncommon meaning of emotion in modern Chinese, has non-psychological\nmeanings (nature, essence, reality etc.) in pre-Han Chinese texts that\nmay coexist with psychological meanings (feelings, inclinations,\ndesires, etc.) of qing. Seok (2013: 140), therefore, explains\nthe meanings of qing in three dimensions: ontological\n(dynamic nature, human existence), epistemological (sense of reality\nand experience), and psychological/moral (emotional expressions and\nfeelings) dimensions. He states that \n\n\ndifferent meanings of qing such as the essential identity of\nthings, affective states of the mind, and the concrete understanding\nof situation/reality are all related to the open interactive and\nembodied interaction between the self and the world. \n\n\nHarbsmeier (2004: 71) provides probably the most comprehensive list of\nqing\u2019s meanings. According to him, qing has\nfollowing meanings in the pre-Buddhist (before 1st century CE)\nChina.\n\n Factual: The basic facts of a matter. This particularly common in\nhistorical and \u201cscientific\u201d prose.\n Metaphysical: Underlying and basic dynamic factors. This is\nparticularly common in YI [Yijing, the Book of\nChanges] and philosophical writings.\n Political: Basic popular sentiments/responses. This occurs in\nwritings on political theory.\n Anthropological: General basic instincts/propensities. This is\nparticularly common in writings on ritual and philosophy.\n Positive: Essential sensibilities and sentiments, viewed as\ncommendable. This is particularly cultivated in Taoist writings.\n Personal: Basic motivation/attitude. This is particularly common\nin historical texts and texts on political philosophy. \n\n2.3 Semantic Dimensions of Qing\n\nUnderneath the polysemy of qing, there are two semantic\ndimensions: one is the ontological and objective dimension\n(qing as nature, essence, or reality) and the other is the\npsychological and subjective dimension (qing as inner\nfeelings or subjective emotions). Regarding the two semantic\ndimensions of qing, Bruya (2003: 157) states that \n\n\nqing carried a range of meaning, from mere facts on one end\nof a spectrum, to pure emotion on the other. \n\n\nThe two seemingly contrastive or even conflicting semantic dimensions\ncaught the academic interest of many sinologists and comparative\nphilosophers. Why does qing have the seemingly contrastive or\nconflicting meanings? Are the two semantic dimensions incompatible\nwith each other? What is the conceptual or philosophical foundation of\nqing\u2019s polysemy? The polysemy of qing will\nguide us to discover the underlying conceptual foundations of emotions\nin early Chinese philosophy, specifically its diverse viewpoints on\nthe affective nature of the mind.\n3. Interpretations of Qing\n\nVarious attempts have been made to explain the semantic, conceptual,\nhistorical, and philosophical relations among different meanings of\nqing, specifically the onto-objective (qing as\nessence, nature or reality) and the psycho-subjective (qing\nas inner subjective feelings) meanings that early Chinese philosophers\ndiscussed in their theories of the mind and morality.\n3.1 Qing as Nature, Essence or Genuineness\n\nGraham (1990: 59) argues that qing should never be\ninterpreted as feelings or passions (i.e., inner subjective states of\nthe mind) in early Chinese philosophy. According to him, the\ninternalized or psychologized meanings of qing became fully\nand explicitly available later in the Song dynasty (960 CE and after)\nwhen qing is paired with xing (\u6027 objective nature\nor essence) in Neo-Confucian metaphysics. He states that qing\nas a noun in the context of pre-Han literature means \u201c\u2019the\nfacts\u2019\u2026as an adjective \u2018genuine\u2019\u201d.\nHowever, he explains in the contexts of the Xunzi and the\nLiji how qing is associated with emotions as\nexpressions of genuine of human nature. He (1990: 64) states that \n\n\nIn these texts [the Xunzi and the Liji], but nowhere\nelse in pre-Han literature, the word [qing] refers only to\nthe genuine in man which it is polite to disguise, and therefore to\nhis feelings. \n\n\nAccording to him, Xunzi uses qing in the sense of the genuine\nor essential nature and explained its affective expressions from the\nviewpoint where the nature of human beings can be found in inner\naffective states. In this way, Graham defends his interpretation of\nqing as essence or genuineness even in the contexts of\nsubjective feelings in some early Chinese texts.\n3.2 Qing as the Inputs from Reality\n\nIn Hansen\u2019s non-belief or non-doxastic approach to Chinese\nphilosophy, specifically to Chinese epistemology and philosophy of\nmind in pre-Buddhist period, qing is an intriguing example of\nsemantic duality. He (1995: 182) discusses two different, almost\nopposite definitions of qing in a typical Chinese English\ndictionary. \n\n\nA typical Chinese-English dictionary\u2026has two entries under\nqingfeeling: The first is \u201caffections, the\nfeelings, desires\u201d; translations of character compounds under\nthis meaning include love, desire, emotion,\nand sentiment. The second definition is \u201ccircumstances;\nfacts of a case\u201d; examples of compounds under this meaning\ninclude truth, situation, reason,\norigin, real facts. \n\n\nHe (1995) characterizes this semantic duality of qing as an\nintriguing combination of the two contrastive properties of\nqing: qing is understood partially as a subjective\ninner state and partially as an objective and external state of\naffairs. He argues that the two meanings of qing poses a\nconceptual conflict only under the exclusive and dichotomous schemes\nof Western philosophy, i.e., the distinction between the\ninner-subjective-psychological mind and the outer-objective-material\nworld and the contrastive or confrontational relation between emotion\nand reason. He states (1995: 183) that \n\n\nChinese views of language, mind, and action do not center on an inner\nsubjectivity or a conception of a mental/intellectual world populated\nby mental/intellectual objects set off against an external world of\nphysical objects or matter. Nor do they make the familiar\nIndo-European faculty and functional distinction between cognitive and\naffective states. A single faculty/organ, the\nxinheart-mind, guides action rather than separate\nfaculties of heart and mind.\n\n\nFrom the viewpoint of these dichotomies, the semantic duality of\nqing becomes puzzling or confusing. However, if, as Hansen\nargues, Chinese philosophy does not subscribe the dichotomies of\nsubjectivity-objectivity and emotion-reason, one can find a way to\ncombine the two meanings of qing in a consistent and\nmeaningful manner. Following this unique Chinese approach to language,\nmind and action, Hansen explains how different meanings of\nqing coexist in Chinese philosophy. According to him (1995:\n196), qing, in early Chinese philosophy, should be understood\nas \u201cthe inputs from reality\u201d or \u201creality\ninduced discrimination or distinction-making reactions\u201d such as\ndark-light, left-right, sweet-sour-salty-bitter, and high-low pitch.\nThat is, qing refers to the inputs from our reaction or\ninteraction with reality. From this broad meaning of qing,\none can understand, as Hansen argues, how qing is discussed\nin early Chinese texts. On the basis of this interpretation of\nqing, he argues that the semantic transition from\nqingreality to qingemotion can\nbe explained by the introduction of Buddhism to Chinese philosophy. He\n(1995: 183) states that \n\n\nI implicitly accept the possibility that the introduction of Buddhism\nimported an Indo-European psychological theory and thus introduced new\ntheoretical roles for qingfeelings and\nyudesire. \n\n\nHansen argues that, with the introduction of Buddhism, Chinese\nphilosophers found a way to understand the mind from the perspective\nof the inner, subjective, representational states, and this\npsychological viewpoint of Buddhism facilitated the development of a\nnew semantic dimension of qing (i.e., qing as\nsubjective feelings) in Chinese philosophy.\n3.3 Qing as Mutual Arousal and Response among Things\n\nBruya (2003) reports that, in many pre-Han texts, qing refers\nto affective states of the mind. Although he does not disagree with\nGraham (1990) that qing, in some contexts of pre-Han\nliterature, means nature, essence, or genuineness of things, he points\nout that qing also means feelings or emotions in other\ncontexts. In fact, qing is closely related to affective\nstates in several pre-Han texts such as the Mencius and the\nXunzi. He states that \u201cthe defining of\n\u2018qing\u2019 in terms of emotions can be now be seen\nexplicitly as early as Mencius\u2026\u201d and argues that the\n\u201cimplicit early cosmology of spontaneous interrelation among\nthings (humans included)\u201d is in the background of the polysemous\nnature of qing (Bruya 2003: 163). He explains that\nqing has at least two different meanings, one being facts or\nsituations and the other being feelings and emotions. However the two\nmeanings, although contrastive or distinctive, are not necessarily\nincommensurable or incomparable to each other because qing\nhas \u201cimplicit emotional overtones in early usage\u201d and\nthese implicit connections between the two meanings became apparent\nand explicit in Chinese texts in the late Warring States period such\nas the Mencius and the Xunzi (Bruya 2003: 152n3).\nAccording to him, the gradual transition or perhaps transformation\nfrom the onto-objective pole (i.e., qing as nature or\nreality) to psycho-subjective pole (i.e, qing as an\ninteractive psychological state of the mind) of qing took\nplace in Mencius\u2019s period and clearly observed in the\nXunzi. He (2003: 169) states that \n\n\nqing is closely associated with mutual arousal and response,\nthe processes of transformation through interpenetration \n\n\nand this general (albeit vague and implicit) understanding of the\nuniverse and human affairs precedes the philosophical discussions of\nqing as an affective state of the mind in the Warring States\nperiod (Bruya 2003: 168\u2013169). For example, he (2003: 163) states\nthat \n\n\nthe defining \u201cqing\u201d in terms of emotions can now\nbe seen explicitly as early as Mencius, and its implicit content can\nbe seen as far back as the Shujing [\u66f8\u7d93 the Book of\nDocuments]. \n\n\nIt is important to note that, in Bruya\u2019s explanation, the\nsemantic transition or conceptual change of qing is not\nunderstood as a sudden shift of viewpoints from the external to\ninternal dimensions of qing. Rather, it is understood as a\ngradual process of the integration and interpenetration of the\nexternal and internal aspects of qing via a particular form\nof philosophical psychology, i.e., understanding of the mind and its\ninner states as a resonating and interactive flow that derives from\nthe generative and interpenetrative cosmological force.\n3.4 Semantic Transition and Transformation of Qing\n\nFollowing this semantic divide and transition from the onto-objective\nto psycho-subjective meanings of qing, one can understand the\npolysemy of qing and its semantic change in early Chinese\nphilosophy. First, qing had or acquired many different\nmeanings over several centuries in ancient Chinese philosophy. Second,\nthere are two major semantic dimensions (onto-objective and\npsycho-subjective dimensions) of qing. Third, the meanings of\nqing had been expanded from the first dimension to the second\ndimension. Fourth, regarding the period of the semantic transition or\nexpansion of qing, different views are proposed: the semantic\ntransition had occurred during the Warring States period (specifically\naround the time of Mencius and Xunzi, i.e., 300 BCE) (Bruya 2003),\nafter the introduction of Buddhism to China (the Han Dynasty around\n250 CE) (Hansen 1995) or during the Song dynasty (around 960 CE)\n(Graham 1990). Regardless of the exact timeline of the semantic\ntransition, Chinese philosophy is greatly influenced by its\nphilosophical reflection on the nature of qing through its\nbroad semantic spectrum of objective nature and subjective feelings.\nCai (2020: 424\u2013425) summarizes the polysemy and the semantic\ntransition of qing in the following way. \n\n\nThe Chinese thinking about qing basically follows an\nobjective-to-subjective trajectory. It begins with philosophical\ninvestigations into the nature of the myriad things or wanwu\n\u842c\u7269 (ten thousand things) during the late Spring and Autumn period\nand the early Warring States period (roughly the late sixth and fifth\ncentury BCE). This is followed by a shift of attention from the\nobjective nature of the things to the subjective nature of\nhumans\u2014their emotion and moral nature\u2014during the middle\nand late Warring States period (roughly fourth and third centuries\nBCE). From the Han onward, the locus of qing discussions\nshifts from philosophy to music and literature, with emotion being\nqing\u2019s core referent.\n\n4. Categories and Lists of Emotions in Early Chinese Texts\n\nAlthough qing does not always mean emotions and feelings in\nmany Chinese texts in the pre-Han period, it is sometimes discussed in\nthe context of cataloging or categorizing psychological states.\nProbably, the most common list of emotions in ancient Chinese texts is\nxi nu ai le (\u559c\u6012\u54c0\u6a02 joy, anger, sadness, and pleasure).\nThey appear in many Chinese texts as representative terms or\ncategories of inner affective states. There are other lists of\nemotions in early Chinese texts but they are somewhat similar to each\nother.\n4.1 Lists of Qing as Emotions\n\nThe following lists show the general scope of emotions in early\nChinese philosophy and how these emotions are compared against Western\ncategories of emotions such as those of Descartes\u2019s (1648\n[1989]) list of passions and Ekman\u2019s (1999) basic emotions.\n\nLiji (9.18) (Fourth Century BCE)\n\n\u559c\u6012\u54c0\u61fc\u611b\u60e1\u6b32\n\njoy, anger, sadness, fear, love, disliking (hate), and liking\n(desire).\nXunzi (17.4, 22.2) (Third Century BCE)\n\n\u597d\u60e1\u559c\u6012\u54c0\u6a02\n\nliking, disliking (hate), joy, anger, sadness, pleasure\nXunzi (22.5) (Third Century BCE)\n\n\u8aaa\u6545\u559c\u6012\u54c0\u6a02\u611b\u60e1\u6b32\n\npersuasions and reasons, joy and anger, sadness and pleasure, love and\ndislike (hate), liking (desire)\nZhuangzi (2.2) (Third Century BCE) \n\u559c\u6012\u54c0\u6a02 \u616e\u5606\u8b8a\u6179\n\u59da\u4f5a\u555f\u614b  joy, anger, grief, delight,\nworry, regret, fickleness, inflexibility, modesty, willfulness,\ncandor, insolence\nXing Zi Ming Chu [Human] Nature comes from the [Heavenly]\nDecree (1.1) (Fourth Century BCE)\n\n\u559c\u6012\u54c0\u60b2\n\njoy, anger, sadness, sorrow\nNei yei (Inward Training; Roth 1999: 51) (Fourth\nCentury BCE)\n\n\u6182\u6a02\u559c\u6012\u6b32\u5229\n\nworry, pleasure, joy, anger, desire, profit (material interest)\nBai Hu Tong (8.2) (First Century CE)\n\n\u559c\u6012\u54c0\uf95c\u611b\uf9b9\n\njoy, anger, sadness, pleasure, love, disliking (hate) \nThe Passions of the Soul (Les Passions de\nl\u2019\u00e2me) (Descartes 1649)\n\nwonder, love, hatred, desire, joy, sadness\n\u201cBasic Emotions\u201d (Ekman 1999)\n\njoy, anger, sadness, fear, disgust, surprise\n\n\nThese lists demonstrate that ancient Chinese philosophers used\ncategories of emotions that are comparable to those of Western\nphilosophy and psychology. In his The Passions of the Soul\n(Les Passions de l\u2019\u00e2me), Descartes (1649)\ndesignates six primitive passions: wonder, love, hatred, desire, joy,\nand sadness. Except wonder, one can see his primitive passions in\nearly Chinese texts. Ekman\u2019s (1999) list of the basic emotions\n(emotions that are universally perceived and recognized across\ncultures and societies, i.e., joy, anger, sadness, fear, disgust,\nsurprise) also overlap substantially with those of early Chinese\nphilosophers. Although the notion of qing is quite\nidiosyncratic and polysemous, the individuation of emotions in early\nChinese philosophy seems comparable to that of Western philosophy and\npsychology.\n4.2 Unusual Categories of Qing\n\nIn the Chinese lists of emotions, however, one can see some unusual\ncategories: \u201cpersuasion and reason\u201d (\u8aaa\u6545) in the\nXunzi (22.5) and profit (material interest) (\u5229) in the\nNei yei. They do not look like categories of emotions. In\naddition, it is unclear whether these lists of emotions refer to the\ndesignated emotions or the whole spectrum of emotions. For example,\nEifring (2019: 190) suggests that xi nu (\u559c\u6012 joy and\nanger), a pair of antonyms, should be understood broadly as the whole\nspectrum emotions, not simply as the two specific emotions (joy and\nanger). He states that xi nu \n\n\nis used as a simple two-character phrase\u2026usually referring to\nemotions in general rather than to these two specific emotions. \n\n\nIt is also unclear whether these lists provide a set of mutually\nexclusive or jointly exhaustive emotions. Since some of the lists\ninclude overlapping categories of emotions. For example, love\n(ai \u611b) and liking (hao \u597d) seem very similar to\neach other so that they have the same antonym, i.e., disliking\n(e \u60e1) in their contrastive pairs. In the Liji,\nai (love) is paired with e (disliking) but in the\nXunzi, hao (liking) is paired with e\n(disliking). In addition, motivational states such as desire\n(yu \u6b32) and liking (hao \u597d) seem to share some\ncommon psychological elements. Therefore, the lists and categories of\nemotions in early Chinese texts should not be understood as complete\nand exhaustive lists of emotions because they are composed of\noverlapping categories that are not mutually exclusive and jointly\nexhaustive. It make little sense to compare them directly against\nDescartes\u2019 primitive passions or Ekman\u2019s basic emotions\nalthough they have some similarities with the Western\ncounterparts.\n4.3 Terms of Emotions in Early Chinese Texts\n\nThese lists of emotions do not appear in ancient Chinese texts before\nthe Warring States period such as oracle bone inscriptions (\u7532\u9aa8\u6587,\njiaguwen) and bronze script of the Shang dynasty (second\nmillennium BCE). They began to show up in the mid to late Warring\nstates period. For example, the Analects and the\nMencius, although they discuss affective states of the mind,\ndo not list emotions in the form of xi nu (\u559c\u6012) or xi\nnu ai le (\u559c\u6012\u54c0\u6a02). The Xunzi and the\nZhuangzi, however, list emotions in various forms that\ninclude xi nu ai le (\u559c\u6012\u54c0\u6a02) (Bruya 2003; Eifring 2019;\nHarbsmeier 2004; Puett 2004). Harbsmeier (2004: 70) reports that terms\nthat refer to emotions such as xi (\u559c joy), nu (\u6012\nanger), ai (\u54c0 sadness), ju (\u61fc fear), ai\n(\u611b love), wu (\u60e1 disliking), and yu (\u6b32 desire)\nare not used in ancient Chinese oracle bone inscriptions. (Xi\n[\u559c] was only used as a proper name but not as a name for an\nemotion.) He also lists the following terms and points out that they\nare \u201cabsent in oracle bones and gradually emerge in the bronze,\nbamboo and silk inscriptions of later times\u201d (Harbsmeier 2004:\n70).\n\n\nxin \u5fc3 heart \nsi \u601d think of, long for \nnian \u5ff5 think about \nzhi \u5fd7 ambition, aspiration \nshen \u613c be careful about \nzhong \u5fe0 impartial, honest\ngong \u606d respect \nci \u6148 be loving \nwu \u609f understand \nwei \u6170 console\nmu \u6155 admire \nxu \u6064 show compassion \nyu \u611a be stupid\ndai \u6020 be lazy \nwang \u5fd8 forget \nhuo \u60d1 be confused\nji \u5fcc resent \nyuan \u6028 resent \nnu \u6012 be angry\nhui \u6094 regret \nbei \u60b2 be sad \ngan \u611f be moved\nkong \u6050 be terrified \nlian \uf98f love\n\n\n\nThe absence of these terms in the ancient Chinese inscriptions, as\nHarbsmeier (2004) explains, do not imply that ancient Chinese had no\nconceptions of emotions or other psychological states. Nor does it\nmean that these terms were not used in ancient China outside the\nrecord keeping purposes of the inscriptions. It simply means that the\nconception and the public discourse of emotions (including writing and\ncompiling texts with these psychological terms) had been changed and\nnew terms had been developed in ancient China, specifically during the\nWarring States period. It is important to note that some of the terms\nin this list (such as \u201cto be lazy\u201d and \u201cto be\nterrified\u201d) are related to behavioral or embodied states, i.e.,\nstates that are experienced by or manifested in the body. That is, in\nancient Chinese texts, the domain of the mind is not limited to the\ninternal or representational states. It is extended to bodily states\nas well.\n5. Emotions in Early Chinese Philosophical Texts\n\nMajor philosophical texts of early Chinese philosophy such as the\nAnalects, the Mozi, and the Laozi, were\nwritten in the Warring States period, the historical period known as\nthe period of the \u201cHundred Schools of Thought\u201d (\u767e\u5bb6).\nMany philosophical schools competed against one another for their\nvisions for personal happiness, virtue, ideal society, stable\ngovernment, and the peaceful world. Some of these schools of\nphilosophy developed inspiring and stimulating theories of the mind\nand emotions. The following sections will survey and explain how\nphilosophical texts of the Warring States period, specifically those\nof Confucianism, Daoism, and Mohism, describe and discuss emotions in\ntheir theories of the mind, morality, and human nature.\n5.1 The Analects\n\nIn many passages of the Analects, Confucius (551\u2013479\nBCE) states that true virtue comes out of a genuine affective state of\nthe mind. He emphasizes that carefully focused affective state is an\nessential component of Confucian virtue. Although Confucius does not\nmake any explicit connection between qing and emotions, his\ngeneral approach to emotions and virtue through the genuineness or\nsincerity of the mind makes an implicit connection between\nqing and emotions in the cultivation of virtue: virtue should\nreflect the affective genuineness that emerges from the essence\n(qing) of humanity. From this moral-psychological viewpoint,\none can understand how qing comes to include subjective\nfeelings and emotions and, at the same time, still refers to the\nessential human nature in early Confucian philosophy.\n\nFeelings and emotions are discussed in many passages of the\nAnalects. Confucius believes that having appropriate\nemotional states is essential in cultivating and perfecting ideal\nvirtues. True filial piety, according to him, is not just one\u2019s\nbehavior of supporting one\u2019s parents but sincere respect and\ncare for them (Analects, 2.7). What distinguishes true filial\npiety from a mere act of fulfilling one\u2019s duty to serve\none\u2019s parents is this inner state of sincere love for\none\u2019s parents. When Fanzi asked about ren (benevolence,\nthe central virtue of Confucianism), Confucius answered that\nren is to love others (Analects, 12.22). When Lin\nFang asked about ritual propriety, Confucius states that \n\n\nIn the ceremonies of mourning, it is better that there be deep sorrow\nthan a minute attention to observances. (Analects, 3.4; Legge\n1960a: 156) \n\n\nHe stresses an appropriate state of the mind, i.e., deep sorrow and\nsincere sadness, not the formal details of the ceremony in ritual\npropriety. At the foundation of Confucian virtues such as filial piety\n(xiao \u5b5d), benevolence (ren \u4ec1), and ritual\npropriety (li \uf9b6), one can always see genuine and\nappropriate emotional states with the fully dedicated mind.\n\nA diverse group of emotions such as le (\u6a02\njoy), ai (\u54c0 sorrow), hao (\u597d liking),\nand you (\u6182 worry) are discussed in\nthe Analects. Confucius always sees, underneath the\nobservable actions and behaviors, deep emotional flow as a critical\nelement of humaneness and moral excellence.\n\n\nThe Master said, \u201cHigh station filled without indulgent\ngenerosity; ceremonies performed without reverence; mourning conducted\nwithout sorrow (ai \u54c0 sorrow)\u2014wherewith should I\ncontemplate such ways?\u201d (Analects, 3.26; Legge 1960a:\n164)\n\nThe Master said, \u201cThey who know [zhi \u77e5] the truth are\nnot equal to those who love [hao \u597d liking] it, and they who\nlove it are not equal to those who delight [le \u6a02 joy] in\nit\u201d. (Analects, 6.20; Legge 1960a: 191)\n\n\nConfucius not only explains virtues through emotional states but also\nexpresses the excitement of cultivating and perfecting virtues through\nlearning (xue \u5b78). The beginning chapter of the\nAnalects starts with Confucius\u2019s excitement of\nlearning: \n\n\nIs it not pleasant [le \u6a02] to learn with a constant\nperseverance and application? Is it not delightful to have friends\ncoming from distant quarters? Is he not a man of complete virtue, who\nfeels no discomposure though men may take no note of him?\n(Analects, 1.1; Legge 1960a: 137) \n\n\nThe excitement and delight in this passage are not simple hedonic\nstates of the mind but a fully engaged sense of one\u2019s virtuous\nmind. Confucius also expresses his sadness when his beloved disciple\nYan Yuan died. Confucius \n\n\nbewailed him exceedingly, and the disciples who were with him said,\n\u201cMaster, your grief is excessive!\u201d \u201cIs it\nexcessive?\u201d said he. \u201cIf I am not to mourn bitterly for\nthis man, for whom should I mourn?\u201d (Analects, 11.10;\nLegge 1960a: 240). \n\n\nHe does not hide his naturally aroused emotions as expressions of his\ngenuine heart-mind. In the Analects, therefore, Confucius\nshows that emotions and feelings are essential components of virtue\nand self-cultivation, and highlights the affective nature of the moral\nmind.\n\nNone of these emotions and feelings, however, are explicitly linked to\nqing in the Analects. Qing appears twice in\nthe Analects, in the contexts where it means genuineness,\ntruthfulness, situations or circumstances. For example, there is no\ndirect connection between qing and emotions in the following\npassages of the Analects. \n\n\nIf he [a superior person] love good faith, the people will not dare\nnot to be sincere [qing, truthful]. (Analects, 13.4;\nLegge 1960a: 265)\n\nThe rulers have failed in their duties, and the people consequently\nhave been disorganized, for a long time. When you have found out the\ntruth [qing, situation] of any accusation, be grieved for and\npity them, and do not feel joy at your own ability.\n(Analects, 19.19; Legge 1960a: 345)\n\n\nIn these passages, qing means genuineness, truthfulness and\nobjective reality. It seems that when Confucius\u2019s teachings were\nrecorded around 500 BCE, qing had little relation to\nsubjective inner feelings even though Confucius discussed emotions and\nfeelings in the Analects. As Graham (1990) and Hansen (1995)\nargue, qing gets associated with emotions and feelings in the\nlater stages of Chinese philosophy. This does not mean that emotions\nare not important or not discussed in Chinese philosophy in the\nWarring States period. In fact, the Analects is filled with\nConfucius\u2019s teachings on emotions and feelings. Le (\u6a02\njoy) appears 23 times in the Analects when filial piety\n(xiao \u5b5d) and righteousness (yi \u7fa9) show up 14 and\n20 times respectively.\n5.2 The Mozi\n\nMozi\u2019s (480\u2013390 BCE) vision for the peaceful and\nprosperous world lies in his philosophy of jian ai (\u517c\u611b),\nimpartial caring or impartial concern for all. He believes that all\nthe major problems of the world such as war, violence, and poverty are\ncaused by the unregulated psychological tendency of partiality and the\nrelentless pursuit of self-interest. According to him, subjective\nfeelings or emotions for others, although they can promote love for\nothers and care for their wellbeing, can become partial and biased\nbecause emotions are typically aroused, expressed, and shared in small\ncommunities of personal relations and social networks. He believes\nthat spontaneously aroused emotions, because of their tendencies of\npartiality, inconsistency, and bias, do not help people to deal with\ntheir hardships and fix the calamities of the world. He states\nthat\n\n\nIt is things such as great states attacking small states, great\nfamilies wreaking havoc with lesser families, the strong robbing the\nweak, the many doing violence to the few, the clever deceiving the\nignorant, and the noble acting arrogantly toward the humble. These are\nsome of the great harms being done in the world. In addition, there\nare rulers who are not kind, ministers who are not loyal, fathers who\nare not loving, and children who are not filial. These too are some of\nthe great harms being done in the world\u2026. If we try to discover\nthe origin of these different harms, where do we find they come\nfrom?\u2026it is those who are partial in their dealings with others\nwho are the real cause of all the great harms in the world.\n(Mozi, 16.1; Ivanhoe and Van Norden 2001: 68)\n\n\nMozi proposes, therefore, jian ai, impartial caring i.e., a\nsense of broad, fair, and consistent moral interest for others\u2019\nwellbeing beyond one\u2019s narrow confinement of personal relations\nand local networks. Generally, ai (\u611b) means love or care.\nIn the context of Mozi\u2019s philosophy, however, it means universal\nlove, i.e., one\u2019s unbiased and impartial interest for\nothers\u2019 wellbeing. It is love, concern, or care without\naffective partiality such as one\u2019s strong feeling for\none\u2019s parents but lack of concern for strangers. For this\nreason, ai does not seem to be a typical emotion of care and\nconcern. Graham (1989: 31\u201332) states that it is\n\u201cunemotional will to benefit and avoid harming people\u201d.\nHowever, ai does not necessarily exclude the affective\nelements of caring or concern. As Shun explains (1997: 31), it can\ninclude \u201creacting affectively in response to negative conditions\nof the objects of concern\u201d. Vir\u00e1g (2017: 59) also points\nout that \n\n\nJian ai possesses a spectrum of meanings in the text [the\nMozi], from strong affection to a more detached concern for\nthe well-being of others. \n\n\nThe unique aspect of Mozi\u2019s jian ai is that it seems to\nbe an affective duty constructed out of his argument to overcome\npartiality and bias. If jian ai is an emotion, it is not a\nspontaneous feeling but a cultivated emotion, i.e., one\u2019s\ncarefully developed, unbiased, impartial, and affective interest for\nthe benefit of others and the world.\n\nMozi presents his famous argument for impartial love in the following\npassage.\n\n\nIf people were to regard others\u2019 states as they regard their own\nstate, then who would still mobilise their own state to attack the\nstates of others? They would regard others\u2019 [states] as they\nregard their own. If people were to regard the capital cities of\nothers as they regard their own capital city, then who would still\nraise their own capital city to strike at the capital cities of\nothers? They would regard others\u2019 [capital cities] as they\nregard their own. If people were to regard the houses of others as\nthey regard their own house, who would still stir their own house to\nbring disorder to the houses of others? They would regard\nothers\u2019 [houses] as they regard their own. Now if states and\ncities did not attack and strike at each other, and if people\u2019s\nhouses did not bring disorder to and damage each other, would this be\nharmful to the world? Or would it be beneficial to the world? This\nmust be beneficial to the world. For the moment let us think about the\norigin of these many benefits, what it is they arise from\u2026.We\nmust say that it is from loving people and benefiting people that they\narise. And, if we were to distinguish and name those in the world who\nlove people and benefit people, would it be as\n\u201cdiscriminating\u201d or as \u201cuniversal\u201d? We must\nsay it would be as \u201cuniversal\u201d. In this case, then, it is\n\u201cmutual and universal\u201d which gives rise to the\nworld\u2019s great benefits. (Mozi, 16.2; Johnston 2010:\n147\u2013149)\n\n\nMozi\u2019s argument, in this passage, does not seem to prove the\nexistence of an emotion of universal love and mutual caring. Instead,\nthe argument attempts to prove the importance of impartiality and the\nnecessity of an emotional dedication for the universal love. It is a\nrational justification that calls for a reciprocal and universal\nviewpoint where one should take equal interest for oneself and others.\nIn this context, one can suspect the psychological reality and\npractical effectiveness of Mozi\u2019s universal love. The main\ntheoretical challenge is to explain the motivation of impartial caring\non the basis of a reasoning that impartial caring is morally justified\nand a rationally right thing to do (Graham 1989: 31\u201332; Nivison\n1996: 84; Vir\u00e1g 2017: 61\u201362). Can the affective\nmotivation of jian ai come out of a rational argument or\ndoxastic moral justification? Although one does not need to\ndistinguish rationality and emotionality of jian ai and can\naccept the diverse forms of moral motivation (Fraser 2011; Robins\n2012), Mozi\u2019s approach to emotion is clearly different from that\nof Confucians, such as Confucius and Mencius. The Confucians believe\nthat natural or genuine emotional states can align themselves with\nmoral will and ideal virtues through the process of self-cultivation,\nlearning or other mental practices. Mozi seems to focus primarily on\nreasoning and rational justification for jian ai, although he\ndoes not completely reject or devalue the affective elements of\njian ai and the various means of its cultivation. According\nto him, jian ai makes rulers kind, ministers loyal, and\nfathers compassionate, and the gentleman carefully examining it and\ndiligently practicing it (Mozi, 16.2; Johnston 2010:\n165).\n\nQing appears 26 times in the Mozi but it does not\nrefer to inner affective states of the mind. Instead, it is used in at\nleast three different ways. Mozi states that\n\n\nEvery creature living between Heaven and earth and within the four\nseas partakes of the nature [qing \u60c5] of Heaven and\nearth and the harmony of the Yin and the Yang. Even the greatest sages\ncannot alter this. How do we know? When they taught about Heaven and\nearth, they dwelt on the upper and the lower spheres and the four\nseasons, the principles of Yin and Yang and human nature [ren\nqing \u4eba\u60c5], the phenomena of men and women, birds and\nanimals, and that of the sexes. Even the early kings could not escape\nfrom the fundamentals of nature. (Mozi, 6.8; Mei 1929:\n26).\n\n\nIn this passage, Mozi describes qing (\u60c5) as the firm\nand objective nature of the world (\u5929\u58e4\u4e4b\u60c5)\nincluding human nature (ren qing \u4eba\u60c5), that is\nunalterable and unmodifiable even by the sage kings. The whole passage\nexplains the natural order of the universe (time, space, living and\nnon-living things) and the natures of human beings and\nanimals. Here, qing has no relation to emotions or\nfeelings.\n\nIn another passage, Mozi uses qing to explain the\nsociopolitical environment of a state. He states that those rulers who\nunderstand the qing of common people will be successful\nleaders but those who do not understand the qing will bring\nchaos (Mozi, 13.1; Mei 1929: 70). Here qing means a\nbroad sociopolitical environment, specifically the living (economic,\ncultural, social and political) conditions of people. Mozi states that\nunderstanding people\u2019s qing is a critical element of\nsuccessful leadership. Rulers should carefully observe the\nsocio-political reality of their states and the living conditions and\nopinions of their people. This type of qing falls in the\nsemantic category of situations, circumstances, or reality. Cai (2020:\n403) interprets it as existential conditions of people and\nVir\u00e1g (2017: 56) takes it as sentiment or affective\ndispositions of people.\n\nQing also means truth or truthful in the Mozi\n(36.1). When Mozi explains the (epistemological) standard of\njudgments, he states that \n\n\nNow that the truth and error [qing wei \u60c5\u507d] (of a\ndoctrine) in the world is hard to tell, there must be three tests.\n(Mozi, 36.1; Mei 1929: 189) \n\n\nMei (1929) translates qing wei as truth and error but it can\nbe understood as genuine (truthful) and artifice (deceiving), i.e., a\ncontrastive pair of epistemological properties. Qing is also\nused adverbially. It means sincerely, earnestly, seriously, or really.\nMozi states that if \n\n\nthe rulers now really [qing \u60c5] desire gain and avert loss,\ndesire security and avert danger, they cannot but condemn offensive\nwars (Mozi, 18.4; Mei 1929: 104) \n\n\nAlthough, the adverbial meaning is related to qing\u2019s\nnounal meaning, i.e., genuineness, it reveals a unique way emotions\nrelate to their objects. Emotions, like beliefs and perceptions, have\ntheir own intentionality, i.e., their own way of referring to their\ntarget objects. For example, people are not just angry. They are angry\nabout certain things or events (someone stole their cars, for example)\nin certain ways (highly stressful and frustrating ways). Regarding\nthis unique form of affective intentionality, Bockover (1995: 174) states that \n\n\nthe difference between beliefs and emotions\u2026is that emotions\nentail distinctively affective ways of being conscious about things.\n\n\n\nIn its adverbial use in the Mozi, qing shows this\nunique aspect of affective intentionality. Emotions do not simply\nrelate to their targets: they can relate to their targets with diverse\nadverbial modes (i.e., strongly, weakly, sincerely, or superficially\netc.).\n5.3 The Mencius\n\nBy following Confucius\u2019s views on the genuineness of emotion in\nmoral virtues, Mencius (372\u2013289 BCE) develops a\nmoral-psychological explanation of the heart-mind (xin\n\u5fc3) and its innate moral foundations with spontaneous arousal\nand motivational purity. He puts moral emotions at the center of his\nphilosophy and argues that the affective genuineness of Confucian\nvirtues emerges from innately given affective inclinations. His four\nmoral sprouts (siduan \u56db\u7aef, the four\nmoral-psychological foundations of Confucian virtues) are the\nheart-mind of pity and compassion (\u60fb\u96b1), shame and\ndislike (\u7f9e\uf9b9), modesty and compliance (\u8fad\u8b93),\nand approve and disapprove (\u662f\u975e) (Mencius, 2A6,\n6A6). For example, one cannot bear to see the suffering of others and\nquickly develops empathic concern for them.  This naturally aroused\naffective inclination is the foundation of the Confucian virtue of\nbenevolence (ren) (Mencius, 2A6). He often compares\nthe cultivation of the moral sprouts to an agricultural process: the\nsprouts can grow naturally because of their inborn nature under the\nparticular external conditions (such as water, soil, and nutrition)\nfor their full maturation. From this onto-generative and innate\nviewpoint of moral emotions, one can see the moral-psychological\nconnection between qing and emotions.  Even though no\nexplicit connection between qing and emotions is made in\nthe Mencius, the genuineness of the human mind in Confucian\nvirtues such as ren (\u4ec1 benevolence), yi\n(\u7fa9 righteousness), li (\uf9b6 ritual propriety), and\nzhi (\u667a wisdom) is traced back to the inborn nature or\nessence, (i.e, qing) of humanity that manifests itself in\nsuch emotional reactions as buren (\uf967\u5fcd not bearing to see\nothers\u2019 suffering) or ceyin (\u60fb\u96b1 pity and\ncompassion).\n\n\nWhen I say that all men have the mind which cannot bear to see the\nsuffering of others, my meaning may be illustrated thus: Now, when men\nsuddenly see a child about to fall into a well, they all have a\nfeeling of alarm and distress, not to gain friendship with the\nchild\u2019s parents, not to seek the praise of their neighbors and\nfriends, nor because they dislike the reputation [of lack of humanity\nif they did not rescue the child]. From such a case, we see that a man\nwithout the feeling of commiseration is not a man; a man without the\nfeeling of shame and dislike is not a man; a man without the feeling\nof deference and compliance is not a man; and a man without the\nfeeling of right or wrong is not a man. (Mencius, 2A6; Chan\n1963: 65)\n\n\nAs one can see in Mencius\u2019s discussion of the four moral sprouts\nin this passage, Mencius\u2019s moral psychology of the heart-mind\nfocuses on the psychological and ontological foundation of moral\nemotions. According to him, Confucian virtues derive from the innate\nfoundations (siduan) and these foundations are naturally\ngiven affective moral inclinations. As Confucius stresses the\nsignificance of sincere emotions in the cultivation of virtues,\nMencius highlights their innate emotional foundations. However, these\nare not just psychological foundations. They are ontological\nfoundations, too. He (2A6) states, for example, lacking the heart-mind\nof ceyin means lacking the essence of humanity. This\nfoundational and ontological approach in Mencius\u2019s moral\nphilosophy provides a stimulating opportunity to connect emotions\n(affective inclinations) and qing (genuine nature) in the\ncontext of the four moral sprouts.\n\nAccording to Mencius, certain emotions are aroused by innately given\npsychological orientations of the mind that flow spontaneously from\nthe original nature of human beings. The four moral sprouts\n(siduan) are such emotions that deserve careful cultivation\nbecause their genuineness derives from human nature. Mencius (2A6,\n6A6) believes that emotions, like living organisms, have roots and\nfoundations, grows and expands, and reaches out to realize their\nnatural potential. They begin and grow like a fire that starts to\nspark and a spring that breaks out (2A6). They should not be\nobstructed or stopped. They should be developed and cultivated to\nrealize their full potential. This is Mencius\u2019s\nmoral-psychological nativism that highlights the affective and\ngenerative moral sprouts at the foundation of the heart-mind and human\nnature (Seok 2008).\n\nFlanagan (2014) characterizes Mencius\u2019s moral psychology of the\nfour moral sprouts as natural teleology because the moral emotions\nhave deep foundations in human nature with the designated endpoints,\ni.e., Confucian virtues. This ontological and teleological approach to\nemotions shows why emotions are important in Confucian philosophy and\nhow emotions and qing can relate to each other. For example,\nqing appears four times (3A4, 4B46, 6A6, 6A8) in the\nMencius and they mean nature/essence or situation/reality.\nGenerally, the semantic content of qing in the\nMencius follows that of the Analects: qing\nis not directly related to inner subjective feelings. Wu\nzhi qing (\u7269\u4e4b\u60c5) means nature of things (3A4)\nand ren zhi qing (\u4eba\u4e4b\u60c5) means the nature\nor natural disposition of human beings (6A8). In 6A6,\nhowever, qing is used to explain the goodness of human nature\nin the context of affective feelings, i.e., the four moral sprouts. He\nstates that \u201cFrom the feelings [qing] proper to it\n[nature], it is constituted for the practice of what is good\u201d\n(6A6; Legge 1960b: 402). In this passage, qing refers to the\nfoundation or root of the moral emotions. Mencius explains that all\nhumans, despite their individual differences, have the same foundation\nof goodness such as the four moral sprouts which are basically moral\nfeelings. These feelings are the foundational essences (qing)\nof humanity that can become virtuous through the process of\ncultivation and learning. Although\nqing in this passage does not refer to inner subjective\nstates of the mind, it means genuine and truthful dispositions of\nhuman beings such as the affective orientations of the mind that can\nbe observed in the four moral sprouts. In this passage, qing\n(nature/essence) comes close to emotions and feelings, not just random\nfeelings but certain feelings with specific innate inclinations that\nreflect underlying nature of human beings. Here, Mencius opens the\ndoor to emotional qing in his discussion of how human beings\ncan become virtuous through the innately given affective sprouts of\nmorality.\n\nOther than the four moral sprouts and their foundational nature,\nMencius discusses emotions and subjective feelings of love, concern,\nand sadness. For example, he discusses king Shun\u2019s (\u821c)\nemotions such as sorrow and love to his parents and brother and\nexplains true filial piety (5A1). Shun\u2019s parents and brother\ntried to kill him but he kept his sincere feelings for them. Like\nConfucius, Mencius believes that genuine emotions are critical\ncomponent of ideal moral virtues. He also points out how emotions\nchange our sense of appropriateness and motivate to adopt certain\nnorms. He states that\n\n\nAnciently, there was no rule for the size of either the inner or the\nouter coffin. In middle antiquity, the inner coffin was made seven\ninches thick, and the outer one the same. This was done by all, from\nthe sovereign to the common people, and not simply for the beauty of\nthe appearance, but because they thus satisfied the natural feelings\nof their hearts [ren xin \u4eba\u5fc3]. (Mencius, 2B16;\nLegge 1960b: 221)\n\n\nIt seems that the thickness of coffin has little to do with emotions\nor feelings but Mencius explains that our feelings for deceased people\nis the reason why the inner coffin has certain thickness. It is not\nbecause of an aesthetic consideration, a universal principle, or a\nsense of duty but because of an affective sense for others that\nmotivated the decision to adopt the particular thickness. From this\nperspective, one can easily understand Mencius\u2019s criticism (3B9)\nof Yang Zhu\u2019s and Mo Di\u2019s views (Yangism and Mohism).\nYang\u2019s view is egoism that promotes one\u2019s self-interest\nbut does not acknowledge the authority of one\u2019s ruler.\nMo\u2019s view is impartial caring that supports the benefit of\nothers but does not recognize one\u2019s feelings and respect for\none\u2019s parents. Mencius states that \u201cto acknowledge neither\nking nor father is to be in the state of a beast\u201d (3B9; Legge\n1960b: 282). It is important to note that what Mencius criticizes here\nis not simply their rejection of the authority of ruler and father.\nRather it is their denial of the caring heart at the center of\nmorality that renders humanity little more than bests. Mencius\nexplains why feelings and emotions for others, specifically for our\nparents, is important and why Yangism and Mohism fail: they propose\nuncaring ways of life. This is clearly presented in Mencius\u2019s\ncomment on Mohist thinker Yi Zhi\u2019s (\u5937\u5b50) view. Mencius\ndiscusses the following example.\n\n\nIn great antiquity there were some who did not bury their parents.\nWhen their parents died, they took them up and threw them into a\nditch. Later when they passed by them and saw foxes and wild cats\neating them and flies and gnats eating them, their perspiration\nstarted out upon their foreheads, they looked askance and could not\nbear to look straight. Now the perspiration was not for the sake of\nother people. It was something at the bottom of their hearts that\nshowed in their expressions. Their immediately went home and returned\nwith baskets and spades and covered the bodies. If it was indeed right\nto cover them, then there must be certain moral principles which made\nfilial sons and men of humanity inter their parents.\n(Mencius, 3A5; Chan 1963: 71)\n\n\nIn this passage, Mencius clearly states that the physical changes in\nthe body are not caused by one\u2019s deliberation or consideration\nof reputation and reward. They simply come out from the bottom of the\nheart (zhong xin \u4e2d\u5fc3\u2014the center or core of the\nheart-mind) in their feelings for others. He believes that Yangism and\nMohism miss this critical element of the affective moral mind.\nAccording to him, we are moral creatures because of the feelings and\nemotions that flow from our genuine nature in its caring heart-mind\nfor others.\n5.4 The Xunzi\n\nXunzi (310\u2013235 BCE) approaches emotions from the perspective of\nthe functions and processes of the mind. The mind, according to him,\nis a functional complexity consisting of diverse processes of feelings\nand its nature is not to draw upon the innate moral orientation but to\nmanifest affective sensitivity and reactivity in expressible forms. If\nthe mind has the spontaneous reactivity to external stimuli, emotions\nand feelings show how the mind interacts with or reacts to the world\n(Xunzi, 11.10). Therefore, his approach to emotions and\nfeelings, in comparison to Mencius\u2019s foundational and moral\napproach, is naturalistic and psychological. Unlike Mencius, he does\nnot investigate and analyze the innate foundations of Confucian\nvirtues. Instead, he discusses how emotions and feelings are aroused\nin the mind to serve particular perceptual, conative, and moral\nfunctions.\n\nXunzi focuses on naturally given inclinations of the mind without\nnecessarily implicating the underlying norms of ideal virtues. He\nstates that\n\n\nThe natural disposition [qing \u60c5] of people is that for food\nthey want meats, for clothes they want embroidered garments, for\ntravel they want chariots and horses, and moreover they want the\nriches of surplus wealth and accumulated goods. Even if provided these\nthings, to the end of their years they would never be satisfied; this\nis also the natural disposition [qing \u60c5] of people.\n(Xunzi, 4.11; Hutton 2014: 29)\n\n\nIn this passage, Hutton translates qing as \u201cthe natural\ndisposition\u201d. It is important to note that the meaning of\nqing as the natural disposition does not necessarily mean\nnormative or teleological sense of nature (i.e., nature as an ideal\nstandard or ultimate goal of human life) but spontaneous, unregulated\nand uncultivated tendencies of human behavior in Xunzi\u2019s\nphilosophy because human qing (\u4eba\u4e4b\u60c5) can\nbe disruptive and disorderly (Xunzi, 23).\n\nFrom this naturalistic viewpoint, Xunzi actively links qing\nwith psychological states and dispositions. In earlier Chinese texts\nsuch as the Mozi, for example, ren qing does not\nrefer to inner psychology or affective states. In the Xunzi,\nhowever, ren zhi qing (\u4eba\u4e4b\u60c5, qing of human\nbeings) or ren qing (\u4eba\u60c5, human qing) refers to\npsychological dispositions or affective states. Cai (2020: 407)\nreports that qing appears 119 times in the Xunzi and\n\n\n\nOf the 119 appearances of qing, fewer than 20 carry the\nneutral or positive import of \u201cthe nature of things\u201d. \n\n\nSpecifically, Xunzi connects qing with inner subjective\nstates. He states that \n\n\nThe feelings of liking and disliking, happiness and anger, and sadness\nand joy in one\u2019s nature are called the dispositions\n[qing \u60c5]. (Xunzi, 22.2; Hutton 2014: 236) \n\n\nAmong Chinese texts in the Warring States period, this is one of the\npassages where qing is discussed explicitly in the context of\ninner subjective feelings. However, the passage, in itself, does not\nnecessarily show that qing is understood or identified as\nemotions in Xunzi\u2019s philosophy. Instead, emotions can be\nunderstood as expressions, derivations, or one of the manifestations\nof the underlying nature or essence of human beings, as Graham (1990:\n64) suggests. Whether one takes Graham\u2019s interpretation or not,\nit is clear that Xunzi brings qing close to the affective\ndimension of the mind. In fact, the careful observation, modification,\nand cultivation of qing as an affective disposition is a key\nelement of Xunzi\u2019s moral philosophy as illustrated in his\nchapters on ritual and music. \n\nAccording to Xunzi, human qing has a distinctive inclination\nof yu (\u6b32 desire). People like to satisfy their desires for\nmaterial goods such as fancy food and fine clothes. \n\n\nThe natural disposition [\u60c5] of people is that for food they want\n[yu \u6b32] meats, for clothes they want embroidered\ngarments\u2026. (Xunzi, 4.11; Hutton 2014: 29) \n\n\nIn this passage, yu (\u6b32) means desire for material values\nand one\u2019s interest in maximizing one\u2019s self-interest.\nXunzi believes that yu is an inborn disposition of human\npsychology and human beings are self-interested individuals who seek\nto satisfy their desires that are not completely satisfied. As a\nresult, yu generates competitive struggle and violence. He\nstates that \n\n\nThey [people] are born with desires of the eyes and ears, a fondness\nfor beautiful sights and sounds. If they follow along with these, then\nlasciviousness and chaos will arise\u2026. (Xunzi 23.1;\nHutton 2014: 248) \n\n\nUnlike Mencius\u2019 optimistic approach to innate dispositions such\nas the four moral sprouts, Xunzi\u2019s approach to the natural\ndisposition of yu is cautious and despairing if not\ncompletely hopeless: yu is a major threat to the orderliness\nand stability of human living. Human nature is evil, he declares\n(Xunzi, 23.1), because of this natural but self-interested\npsychological disposition of the human mind.\n\nYu is typically understood as a conative state, a state of\nwanting or seeking (Xunzi, 4.11, 23.1). However, Xunzi\nexplains it in the context of perceptual states such as seeing,\nhearing, and tasting, i.e., how our sensory organs search for their\nobjects.\n\n\nAs for people\u2019s natural dispositions [qing \u60c5], their\neyes desire [yu \u6b32] the utmost in sights, their ears desire\nthe utmost in sounds, their mouths desire the utmost in flavors, their\nnoses desire the utmost in smells, and their bodies desire the utmost\nin comfort. These \u201cfive utmosts\u201d are something the natural\ndispositions [qing \u60c5] of people cannot avoid desiring.\n(Xunzi, 11.10; Hutton 2014: 104)\n\n\nIn this passage, Xunzi describes the way our sensory organs are\nrelated to their targets. Perceptual states have their objects, i.e.,\nwhat they see, hear, and smell. Yu describes this relational\nproperty (i.e., intentionality) of the mind in addition to its\noriginal function of desiring \u201cfive utmost objects\u201d. That\nis, yu is not just a natural tendency to satisfy one\u2019s\ndesires but also perceptual intentionality that resides at a\nfoundational (perceptual) level of the human mind. If intentionality,\nas Brentano (1874) explains, is a distinctive and an essential nature\nof the mind, Xunzi\u2019s yu and qing include this\nfoundational aspect of the mind (the relationality or about-ness of\nthe mind) from an affective viewpoint.\n\nThe relation between qing and yu, therefore, should\nbe understood at a deeper level of human nature or perhaps the nature\nof the universe. Xunzi provides such an explanation. He states\nthat\n\n\nHuman nature [xing \u6027 nature] is the accomplishment of\nHeaven [tian \u5929]. The dispositions [qing \u60c5\nnatural disposition or essential property] are the substance of the\nnature [xing \u6027 nature]. The desires [yu \u6b32] are\nthe responses of the dispositions [qing \u60c5] to things.\nViewing the objects of desire as permissible to obtain and seeking\nthem are what the dispositions [qing \u60c5] cannot avoid.\n(Xunzi, 22.15; Hutton 2014: 244)\n\n\nIn this passage, Xunzi explains that yu derives from\nqing and qing comes from xing (the\nfoundational nature of things). Against this broad process of\nderivation from tian (Heaven) to yu through\nxing and qing (as indicated in the schematic diagram\nbelow), yu can be understood as an unavoidable inborn\ndisposition of human beings. \n\n\nTian (\u5929 Heaven) \u2192 Xing (\u6027 nature) \u2192\nQing (\u60c5 natural disposition) \u2192 (Qing\u2019s\nResponse [Ying \u61c9] to external stimulation) \u2192\nYu (\u6b32 desire)\n\n\nThis cosmological process can help us understand how qing\ncame to include a new semantic dimension, i.e., psychological\ndisposition of desire or emotion from its original meaning of nature\nor essence. According to Xunzi, qing is related not only to\nobjective and essential nature of things (xing \u6027) but also\nto the psychological inclinations of human beings (yu \u6b32),\nbecause qing derives from xing (nature) and\ngenerates yu (desire). In this process of\nqing\u2019s origination and projection, one can understand\nthat qing does not simply refer to objective, static, and\neternal nature of things but also to the interactive and responsive\ndispositions of human beings. A similar approach to qing can\nbe found in Xing Zi Ming Chu\n(\u6027\u81ea\u547d\u51fa Human Nature comes from the\nMandate), an excavated Confucian text written in the mid-fourth to\nearly third century BCE. According to Xing Zi Ming\nChu, qing is aroused when xing (human nature)\nis stimulated by external objects. \n\n\nEmotional (xi, nu, ai, bei\n[delight, anger, grief, sadness]) qi [material force or\nphysical energy] is due to xing. When it manifests\nexternally, it is due to sensual contact with things (wu qu\nzhi \u7269\u53d6\u4e4b). (Xing Zi Ming Chu, 1.1;\nTang, Bruya, and Wen 2003: 275; Middendorf 2008: 152) \n\n\nFrom this broad perspective of foundational xing and\nresponsive qing, one can understand how the objective and\nsubjective aspects of qing are integrated in Xunzi\u2019s\nphilosophy through the interactive responsiveness or resonance among\nthings.\n\nXunzi\u2019s naturalistic and psychological approach, however, does\nnot imply that emotions are just subjective feelings and the mind is\nonly amoral or immoral. The genuineness of emotion is still important\nin Xunzi\u2019s moral psychology, as in Confucius\u2019s and\nMencius\u2019s. Xunzi discusses, for example, why it is important to\npay full respect to deceased people with loyalty, generosity and the\nfull decoration of coffins. He explains that people have genuine\nfeelings for deceased people because treating life and death with one\nand the same care is what people all wish for (Xunzi, 19.17;\nHutton 2014: 207). He also explains how genuine emotions can be\ncultivated through the affective transformation. According to him,\nemotional genuineness can be developed through various means of social\nand cultural activities such as ritual and music because affective\nstates, through careful adjustment and modification, can be enriched\nand refined to become sincere states of the mind. For example, people\nfind joy in music with their deep and affective resonance with musical\nperformance. Xunzi states that \u201cSounds and music enter into\npeople deeply and transform people quickly\u201d (Xunzi,\n20.5; Hutton 2014: 219). Even though emotions are influenced by the\nnatural disposition of yu, they can transform the heart-mind\nto follow the way of the sages through the process of responsive\nrefinement in music and ritual. Xunzi\u2019s philosophy shows this\ndevelopmental and transformative nature of emotions.\n5.5 The Laozi (Dao De Jing)\n\nThe Laozi (\uf934\u5b50), also known as Dao De\nJing (\u9053\u5fb7\u7d93, The Book of Dao and De),\nis a Daoist text in the Warring States period. Laozi (Lao-tzu or Lao\nDan) is believed to be its single author although many scholars today\nbelieve that it is a composite work by several authors and/or\neditors. In the\nLaozi, the term qing is not found. There is no\ndiscussion of particular natures and dispositions of human beings\nunder a single term such as qing (\u60c5) or xing\n(\u6027). However, individual emotions or affective states such as anger\n(nu \u6012), resentment (yuan \u6028) courage\n(yong \u52c7), loving kindness (ci \u6148) and desire\n(yu \u6b32) are discussed in the Laozi. Laozi believes\nthat emotions have lasting influence on human behavior and destructive\nemotions can threaten the wellbeing of people and damage their\nharmonious social interactions. Although he does not discuss seriously\nwhether emotions are genuine or superficial or whether they change or\ntransform the inner states of the mind as Mencius or Xunzi does, he\ndiscusses how emotions affect behaviors of people and motivate them to\nhelp or harm themselves and others.\n\nHe states that\n\n\nI have three treasures that I hold on to and preserve:\n\nThe first I call loving kindness [ci \u6148];\n\nThe second I call frugality [jian \u5109];\n\nThe third I call never daring to put oneself first in the world.\n\nThe kind can be courageous [yong \u52c7];\n\nThe frugal can be generous;\n\nThose who never dare to put themselves first in the world can become\nleaders of the various officials.\n\nNow to be courageous without frugality,\n\nTo put oneself first without putting oneself behind others,\n\nThese will lead to death. (Laozi, 67; Ivanhoe 2002:\n70)\n\n\nIn this passage, Laozi mentions loving kindness, frugality and not\nbeing self-interested or self-centered as the three treasures and\nexplains how they influence the success and failure of people. Among\nthem, loving kindness and courage are affective dispositions that help\nindividuals to be successful leaders but lacking them would lead to\nfailure and death.\n\nFollowing the same line of thinking, he explains that emotions can\nhelp or harm people depending on their circumstances. Like rain helps\npeople when the land is dry but harms people when the river is\nflooding, emotions should be carefully aroused and expressed. He\nstates that \n\n\nTo be courageous in daring leads to death, To be courageous in not\ndaring leads to life. These two bring benefit to some and loss to\nothers. (Laozi, 73, Ivanhoe 2002: 76) \n\n\nLaozi also warns us about harmful or destructive emotions. Some of\nthese are negative emotions, emotions that have negative valence such\nas anger and resentment. Laozi suggests that one should carefully deal\nwith anger and resentment. He states that one should \u201crepay\nresentment with Virtue [de \u5fb7]\u201d (Laozi, 63;\nIvanhoe 2002: 66) and \u201cThose good at attack are never enraged\n[nu \u6012]\u201d (Laozi, 68; Ivanhoe 2002: 71).\nSpecifically, he talks about confrontational or contentious attitudes\nand dispositions: they are antagonistic or hostile toward others and\ntheir interest by focusing exclusively on one\u2019s own interest. He\nstates that \n\n\nThose good at conquering their enemies never confront them. Those good\nat using others put themselves in a lower position. This is called the\nVirtue of noncontention. (Laozi, 68; Ivanhoe 2002: 71)\n\n\nOne of the frequently discussed emotions in the Laozi is\ndesire (yu \u6b32). Desire, specifically a natural tendency\nto satisfy one\u2019s basic needs, is not necessarily negative or\nevil but Laozi mentions it 26 times in this relatively short text and\ncarefully explain its potentially harmful effects because of its\nexclusive nature (its selfish or self-centered orientation that\nexcludes or disregards others\u2019 interests or viewpoints). Laozi\nstates that \u201cthe great Way [\u5927\u9053] is always without\ndesires [\u6b32]\u201d (Laozi, 34) and \u201cthose who\npreserve the Way [\u9053], do not desire [\u6b32]\nfullness\u201d. (Laozi, 16).  He emphasizes that one should\nminimize one\u2019s desire (Laozi, 1, 19) to understand and\nfollow the Way (dao). Vir\u00e1g characterizes\nLaozi\u2019s rather cautionary and reproving approach to emotions,\nspecifically desire, as one of the salient features of\nthe Laozi. She (Vir\u00e1g 2017: 76) states that\n\n\n\nOne of the salient features of this text [the Laozi] is its\nnegative account of emotions and desires as fundamentally contrary to\nthe realization of the perfected life\u2014a life in accordance with\nthe natural process of the cosmos.\n\n\nLaozi\u2019s reproving approach to desire, however, should be\ncarefully understood since he does not say that one should simply\nreject or suppress one\u2019s desire. In the first chapter of the\nLaozi, he makes a paradoxical statement about desire and\ndesirelessness in their relations to the ultimate Way:\n\n\nA Way that can be followed is not a constant Way.\n\nA name that can be named is not a constant Way.\n\nNameless, it is the beginning of Heaven and earth.\n\nNamed, it is the mother of the myriad creatures.\n\nAnd so,\n\nAlways eliminate desires in order to observe its [Way\u2019s]\nmysteries;\n\nAlways have desires in order to observe its [Way\u2019s]\nmanifestations.\n\n(Laozi, 1; Ivanhoe 2002: 1).\n\n\nLaozi, as he does in many chapters of the Laozi, presents an\nintriguing paradox of desire and desirelessness in this passage. The\npassage can be interpreted in many different ways. From a contextual\nviewpoint, desire (yu) can be beneficial or harmful, or\ncultivated or eliminated as courage (yong) can be beneficial\nor deadly in certain situations to certain people (Laozi,\n73). From a psychological viewpoint, certain aspects of desire (such\nas exclusive promotion of self-interest, sensual indulgence, or\nself-centered viewpoint) is harmful but others (such as a natural\ninclination to satisfy one\u2019s basic needs) are acceptable.\nHowever, considering the significance of this chapter, i.e., the\nbeginning chapter of the Laozi where the ultimate Way and the\nlinguistic or conceptual limitation of properly identifying and\ndescribing it are discussed, the paradox of desire and desirelessness\ncan be understood from the viewpoint of the intriguing relation\nbetween desire and the Way. The relation between the two can be\nexplained in two opposite ways: desire may distort the Way (in this\ncase, desirelessness is needed) but it helps us to initiate our\njourney toward the Way (in this case, desire is needed). These\nconflicting approaches to desire show both the limitation and the\nopenness of desire in our journey to understand the Way. Perhaps the\nrelation between the Way and desire can be characterized as a form of\naffective intentionality where emotions open up, guide, and change our\nemotional projection to the world and the Way. Regardless of these\ninterpretations of desire, it is clear that Laozi\u2019s view is not\nsimply ascetic and eliminative toward desire, even though he cautions\nagainst its potentially harmful and destructive nature, specifically\nthe exclusive pursuit of self-interest and self-centered viewpoint\nthat can generate the confrontational, narrow-minded and myopic\nunderstanding of the self and others.\n\nOverall, the Laozi develops a stimulating view on the nature\nof emotions and affective dispositions. It provides a seemingly\nnegative but cautiously practical and ingenuously encouraging\ndiscussion of how emotions affect people. Some emotions, specifically\nanger and desire, can be harmful and destructive in certain contexts,\nnot just because of their negative valance but because of the\nexclusive and self-oriented viewpoints. In addition, the\nLaozi focuses on how emotions interact with other emotions,\nhow they affect behaviors, and how they contribute to the wellbeing of\npeople and the stability of their communities.\n5.6 The Zhuangzi\n\nThe Zhuangzi is a Daoist text in the late Warring States\nperiod. It is believed to be written by a Daoist philosopher Zhuangzi\n(369\u2013286 BCE) but his authorship is debated especially in the\nouter chapters (wai pian \u5916\u7bc7, chapters 8 through\n22) and the miscellaneous chapters (za pian \u96dc\u7bc7,\nchapters 23 through 33) of the text. It consists of stories and\nanecdotes that deliver the insightful and intriguing messages of\nDaoism and the Daoist way of life. It also develops an inspiring\napproach to emotions and their foundations in the natural inclinations\nof the human mind.  Although qing refers to the essential\nnature of things in some passages of the Zhuangzi, in other\npassages it refers to the psychological foundation of affective\ndispositions. Therefore, it is important to see how he\nunderstands qing and how\nqing and emotions are related in the Zhuangzi.\n\nZhuangzi believes that emotions are natural phenomena like wind, rain,\nand thunder. As we cannot change wind, rain, and thunder, we cannot\navoid naturally arising feelings. He states that\n\n\nJoy, anger, grief, delight, worry, regret, fickleness, inflexibility,\nmodesty, willfulness, candor, insolence\u2014 music from empty holes,\nmushrooms springing up in dampness, day and night replacing each other\nbefore us, and no one knows where they sprout from. Let it be! Let it\nbe! (Zhuangzi, 2.2; Watson 2013: 8)\n\n\nIn this passage, Zhuangzi lists emotions along with natural events\nsuch as growing mushrooms and alternating day and night.\nZhuangzi\u2019s point in this passage is that, like natural\nphenomena, emotions are aroused spontaneously without any plans or\nforethoughts. This naturalistic approach, however, does not imply that\nemotions are unpredictable and unregulated chaos and one should not\nfeel or react to any emotions. Rather, it suggests that one should\nfeel emotions without any expectations or suppositions. Unlike early\nConfucian philosophers such as Mencius or Xunzi who searches for the\nontological or moral foundation of emotions in qing (\u60c5) or\nxin (\u5fc3 the heart-mind), Zhuangzi, in this passage, takes\nemotions as they are without relating them to their foundations or\nanalyzing them with their originations. He suggests that one should\nnot judge or inculcate them with social conventions or moral\nnorms.\n\nIt is, therefore, meaningless to feel emotions as positive, negative,\nattractive or repulsive as it is equally meaningless to describe day\nand night as positive or negative. Zhuangzi believes that developing\nlikes or dislikes (affective interpretations or evaluations of our\nsensory and perceptual interaction with the world) is an inappropriate\nway to feel or understand naturally arising emotions and can hurt\nindividuals who are caught by their likes and dislikes. Thus, he says\nthat one should not \u201cby his likes and dislikes do any inward\nharm to himself\u201d (Zhuangzi, 5.6). In the following\nconversation, he explains his thoughts on how one should approach\nfeelings and emotions.\n\n\nHuizi said to Zhuangzi, \u201cCan a man really be without feelings\n[qing]?\u201d\n\nZhuangzi: \u201cYes\u201d.\n\nHuizi: \u201cBut a man who has no feelings [qing] \u2014how\ncan you call him a man?\u201d\n\nZhuangzi: \u201cThe Way gave him a face; Heaven gave him a\nform\u2014why can\u2019t you call him a man?\u201d\n\nHuizi: \u201cBut if you\u2019ve already called him a man, how can he\nbe without feelings [qing]?\u201d\n\nZhuangzi: \u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean by feelings\n[qing ]. When I talk about having no [qing]\nfeelings, I mean that a man doesn\u2019t allow likes or dislikes to\nget in and do him harm. He just lets things be the way they are and\ndoesn\u2019t try to help life along\u201d. (Zhuangzi, 5.6;\nWatson 2013: 40\u201341)\n\n\nIn this passage, Zhuangzi distinguishes two different forms of\nqing. When he says \u201ca man has no feelings\u201d, he is\ntalking about the feelings of likes and dislikes. This type of\nfeelings can affect us and motivate us to accept and follow certain\nviewpoints, rules, or norms. However, natural feelings come to\none\u2019s mind without bringing in any suppositions or judgments of\nacceptance and rejection. In their analysis of this passage, Ma and\nvan Brakel (2021: 137) state by quoting Graham (1981 [2001: 82]) that\n\n\n\nZhuangzi himself says explicitly that Huizi\u2019s and his\nunderstandings of qing are different: \u201cYou are\nmisunderstanding what I mean by qing\u201d (Legge 1891:\n235); \u201cshifei\u201d [evaluative judgments such as\nlikings and dislikings] is what I mean by\n\u201cqing\u201d.\n\n\nHere one can see Zhuangzi\u2019s naturalistic or phenomenological\napproach to emotions. According to him, having no feelings does not\nmean that one should feel no emotions. Instead, he suggests that one\nshould take emotions simply as spontaneously and naturally arising\nfeelings so that sadness and pleasure cannot find a way in to disturb\nand hurt one\u2019s mind. Thus he states that \u201cIf you are\ncontent with the time and willing to follow along, then grief and joy\nhave no way to enter\u201d (Zhuangzi 3.5; Watson 2013: 21).\nZhuangzi, therefore, does not promote asceticism, fatalism, or apathy.\nInstead, he emphasizes one\u2019s full acceptance of naturally given\nqing (xing ming zhi qing\n\u6027\u547d\u4e4b\u60c5 naturally given affective\ndisposition). Emotions come and go like day and night and we should be\nhappy and sad as they show up and strike us with certain moods and\nfeelings.\n\nFor this reason, Zhuangzi warns about one\u2019s desire (yu\n\u6b32) to satisfy and extend one\u2019s likes and dislikes and\nemphasizes the importance of accepting and accommodating the naturally\narising feelings of emotion. He states that \n\n\nIf you try to fulfill all your appetites and desires and indulge your\nlikes and dislikes, then you will bring affliction to the true form of\nyour inborn nature and fate [xing ming zhi qing\n\u6027\u547d\u4e4b\u60c5, naturally\ngiven qing]. (Zhuangzi, 24.1; Watson 2013: 199) \n\n\nIn this passage, he argues that one\u2019s desire is the foundation\nof one\u2019s likes and dislikes that cause the deviance from or\ndistortion of naturally flowing emotions. Once one\u2019s likes and\ndislikes distort or mislead one\u2019s natural feelings, one is\nlikely to be caught by mental struggle and psychological illness such\nas frustration, depression, and stress. Therefore, he suggests one\nshould preserve and follow the spontaneous nature of the mind in\none\u2019s feelings and emotions. He states that \n\n\nPeople of today, when they come to ordering their bodies and\nregulating their minds, too often do it in a manner like that which\nthe border guard described. They turn their backs on the Heavenly\npart, deviate from the inborn nature, destroy the true form\n[qing], and annihilate the spirit, just to be doing what the\ncrowd is doing. (Zhuangzi, 25.6; Watson 2013: 220)\n\n\nPerhaps one of the stimulating ways to understand Zhuangzi\u2019s\nview on emotions and naturally given qing (xing ming zhi\nqing \u6027\u547d\u4e4b\u60c5) is to compare his approach to qing\nwith that of Xunzi\u2019s. Xunzi believes that qing can be\nperfected by ritual, music, or other means of self-cultivation. To\nZhuangzi, the whole idea of modifying or transforming qing\nthrough Confucian propriety and self-cultivation for the purpose of\nsocial order and moral edification misses critically important\nproperties of qing, i.e., its natural spontaneity and\nunbiased openness. According to him, our feelings and emotions are\nimportant to us not because they can be perfected or matured but\nbecause they help us to sense and feel things without any premeditated\nor predetermined viewpoints or biases imposed upon by social\nconventions and moral norms. He stresses that one should preserve\none\u2019s naturally given qing because one\u2019s\nachievement of the ultimate rightness consists in not losing\none\u2019s natural qing. (Zhuangzi, 8.1).\nTherefore, he criticizes Confucian virtues of benevolence\n(ren) and righteousness (yi) by stating that \n\n\nMy definition of expertness has nothing to do with benevolence and\nrighteousness; it means following the true form of your inborn nature\n[xing ming zhi qing \u6027\u547d\u4e4b\u60c5 naturally given\nqing]. (Zhuangzi, 8.3; Watson 2013: 63) \n\n\nHansen (1995: 21) explains these contrastive approaches to\nqing by stating that \n\n\nZhuangzi\u2026is normally positive about \u60c5\nqingreality responses. Xunzi is notoriously\nnegative. Zhuangzi is negative about Confucian traditions and\nconventions. Xunzi is positive about them. \n\n\nAs Hansen describes in his comparison between Xunzi\u2019s and\nZhuangzi\u2019s views, there are at least two contrastive approaches\nto emotions in early Chinese philosophy. According to Xunzi\u2019s\nConfucian approach, emotions are understood as the manifestations of\nhuman nature and the developmental potential of virtue. According to\nZhuangzi\u2019s Daoist approach, however, the ontological foundation\nand moral cultivation of emotions are neither important nor necessary\nin understanding and feeling emotions. Emotions are spontaneously and\nnaturally arising feelings that we should not attempt to judge and\nmodify for the sake of human nature, moral norms or social\nconventions.\n",
