    "main_text": "Criticism\n8. Criticism\n\n\nPhilosophical criticism of Buber tends to focus on three areas: [1]\nepistemological questions regarding the status of the I-Thou\nform of relationship and the status of the object-world delimited by\nthe I-It form of relationship, [2] hermeneutical questions\nregarding Buber\u2019s reading of Hasidic source material, and [3] doubts\nregarding the author\u2019s rhetoric and style that touch upon the\nphilosophy of language. All three lines of criticism have at their\ncore the problem of the conflict between realism and idealism,\nworld-affirmation and world-denial.\n\n\nThe nature of the world picture in Buber\u2019s magnum opus has\nalways been among the most contested aspects of Buber\u2019s\nphilosophy in the critical literature. I and Thou is\nconsidered to have inaugurated \u201ca Copernican revolution in\ntheology (\u2026) against the scientific-realistic attitude\u201d\n(Bloch [1983], p. 42), but it has also been criticized for its\nreduction of fundamental human relations to just two\u2014the\nI-Thou and the I-It. Writing to Buber after the\npublication of I and Thou, Rosenzweig would not be the last\ncritic to complain, \u201cIn your setting up the I-IT, you give the\nI-Thou a cripple for an opponent.\u201d He continued to rebuke,\n\u201cYou make of creation a chaos, just good enough to provide\nconstruction material (Baumaterial) for the new\nbuilding\u201d (Franz Rosenzweig, Briefe und Tageb\u00fccher,\npp. 824\u20135). In Jewish philosophical circles, it has been long argued\nthat Buber was unable to ward off the relativism, subjectivism, and\nantinomianism that are said to permeate non-realist epistemologies and\nontologies. Building on Rosenzweig\u2019s complaint against\nBuber\u2019s epistemology, Steven Katz called for a\n\u201crealism\u201d that affirms the rich world of stable objects\nextended in time and space. It is still widely assumed by his critics\nin Jewish philosophy that in his critique of Jewish law and the\nI-It form of relationship Buber rejected the world of\nobject-forms in toto.\n\n\nIn addition to hermeneutical arguments regarding historicism,\nanti-historicism, literary style and poetic license, arguments about\nthe picture of Hasidism that emerged out of Buber\u2019s research and\nwriting are also based upon the philosophical world picture as it took\nshape in Buber\u2019s philosophical universe. Against Buber\u2019s corpus of\nHasidica, the doyen of Kabbalah scholarship, Gershom Scholem, was one\nof the first to throw down the gauntlet. Scholem argued that Buber\u2019s\nfocus on the genre of folk-tales obscured the theoretical works within\nthe corpus Hasidic literature, where the phenomenon of (gnostic) world\ndenial was more pronounced than in the popular tales. Buber\u2019s later\ncollections of Hasidic tales in particular reflect a this-worldly\nethos at odds with important tenets of Hasidic mysticism. Whereas\nBuber\u2019s early, neo-romantic Hasidica assumed a more distant and even\nantagonistic relation to the world of time and space, critics, such as\nScholem, Katz, and Schatz-Uffenheimer, focused their critique almost\nexclusively on the later body of work, in which a this-wordly\ncosmology was more sharply articulated, in line with Buber\u2019s own\nrenewed interest, starting in the mid to late 1920s, with quotidian\nforms of existence.\n\n\nThe analytic philosopher Steven T. Katz, author of an important\nessay about the particularism of mystical language, articulated a range\nof criticisms directed against Buber\u2019s writings (Katz, 1985).\nMore recently, Katz revisited and mitigated some of these earlier\ncriticisms that included the charge of antinomianism, the lack of an\naccount for the enduring character of the I-Thou relation, and\nthe misrepresentation of Hasidic thought (Katz in Zank, 2006). What\nremains most objectionable in Buber is the tendency toward an\naestheticization of reality and the problem of Buber\u2019s often\nslippery poetic rhetoric. Walter Kaufmann, who produced a second\nEnglish translation of I and Thou, articulated his displeasure\nwith Buber most strongly. While he did not regard the lack of deep\nimpact of Buber\u2019s contributions to biblical studies, Hasidism, and\nZionist politics as an indication of failure, Kaufmann considered I\nand Thou a shameful performance in both style and content. In\nstyle the book invoked \u201cthe oracular tone of false\nprophets\u201d and it was \u201cmore affected than honest.\u201d\nWriting in a state of \u201cirresistible enthusiasm,\u201d Buber\nlacked the critical distance needed to critique and revise his own\nformulations. His conception of the I-It was a\n\u201cManichean insult\u201d while his conception of the\nI-Thou was \u201crashly romantic and ecstatic,\u201d and\nBuber \u201cmistook deep emotional stirrings for revelation.\u201d\n(Kaufmann [1983] pp. 28\u201333). The preponderance in Buber\u2019s writings of\nrhetorical figures, such as \u201cexperience,\u201d\n\u201crealization,\u201d \u201crevelation,\u201d\n\u201cpresence\u201d and \u201cencounter,\u201d and his\npredilection for utopian political programs such as anarchism,\nsocialism, and a bi-national solution to the intractable national\nconflict between Jews and Arabs in Palestine, are in line with a\nvagueness in his philosophical writing that often renders Buber\u2019s\nthought suggestive, but elusive. Similar criticisms apply to\nBuber\u2019s claim that language has the power to reveal divine\npresence or uncover Being.\n\n\nBuber\u2019s early Jugendstil rhetoric was a far cry from\nthe neue Sachlichkeit of the nineteen twenties (Braiterman,\n2007). While similarly inclined literary authors like Hermann Hesse\npraised Buber\u2019s German renditions of Hasidic lore and his Bible\ntranslation later gained popular praise among German theologians,\nothers, among them Franz Kafka, Theodor W. Adorno, and Siegfried\nKracauer, spoke of Buber\u2019s style disparagingly.\n\n\nOn a more biographical note, the\nphilosopher of the \u201cI and Thou\u201d allowed very few people to\ncall him by his first name; the theorist of education suffered no\ndisturbance of his rigorous schedule by children playing in his own\nhome; the utopian politician alienated most representatives of the\nZionist establishment; and the innovative academic lecturer barely\nfound a permanent position in the university he had helped to create\u2014the \nHebrew University of Jerusalem. Some of the most dedicated students\nof this inspiring orator and writer found themselves irritated by the\nconflict between their master\u2019s ideas and their own attempts at putting\nthem into practice. In the final analysis it seems as if Buber always\nremained the well-groomed, affected, prodigiously gifted, pampered\nViennese boy, displaced in a land of horses and chemists, whose best\ncompany were the works of his own imagination and whose self-staging\novertures to the outside world were always tainted by his enthusiasm\nfor words and for the heightened tone of his own prodigious voice.\n",
