    "main_text": "Embodied Cognition: Themes and Close Relations || Extended Cognition\n2.3 Extended Cognition\n\n\nClose kin to embedded cognition, extended cognition moves from the\nclaim that cognition is embedded to claim additionally that the\nenvironmental and social resources that enhance the cognitive\ncapacities of an agent are in fact constituents of a larger\ncognitive system, rather than merely useful tools for a cognitive\nsystem that retains its traditional location wholly within an\nagent\u2019s nervous system (Clark and Chalmers 1998; Menary 2008).\nSome interpret the thesis of extended cognition to mean that cognition\nactually takes place outside the nervous system\u2014within the\nextra-cranial resources involved in the cognitive task (Adams and\nAizawa 2001; 2008; 2009; 2010). Others interpret the thesis more\nmodestly, as claiming that parts of an agent\u2019s environment or\nbody should be construed as parts of a cognitive system, even if\ncognition does not take place within these parts, thus extending\ncognitive systems beyond the agent\u2019s nervous system (Clark and\nChalmers 1998; Wilson 1994; Wilson and Clark 2001).\n",
