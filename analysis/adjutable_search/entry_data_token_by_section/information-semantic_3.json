    "main_text": "Information, Modes of Presentation, and Meaning\n2. Information, Modes of Presentation, and Meaning\n\nTheories of meaning that turn on modes of presentation have been\ncommon in philosophy in one way or another since Frege\u2019s\nSense and Reference. The story is as follows. There must be\nmore to the meaning of a referring term than its referent, since terms\ncan co-refer. For example, James Newell Osterberg Jr. and\nIggy Pop both refer to the same individual. In spite of this\nthe intuition that they do not mean the same thing is strong.\n\u201cIggy Pop is Iggy Pop\u201d and \u201cIggy Pop is James Newell\nOsterberg Jr.\u201d do not seem to mean the same thing.\nSimilarly, it seems to be the case that \u201cAlice believes that\nIggy Pop was the singer in The Stooges\u201d might true, whilst\n\u201cAlice believes that James Newell Osterberg Jr. was the singer\nin The Stooges\u201d might be false, at least on one natural reading\nthat is in line with our intuitions with regard to meanings.\n\nFrege\u2019s well known response is that both the referent and the\nsense of a referring term play a role in specifying its semantic\ncontent. But what is the sense of a term? Frege\u2019s own way of\ncashing out the notion of sense is in terms of a mode of\npresentation (MOP), an idea used by many later philosophers. The\nMOP of a referring term is the way in which the putative referent of\nthe term is presented to us by our phenomenology. MOPs are what we\nwould use in an attempt to identify or locate the referent of a\nreferring term whose meaning we grasp. Many contemporary theories of\nmeaning that turn on information, incorporate MOPs in one way or\nanother. The reason for this is that although reducing the meaning of\na term to the information carried or transmitted by it alone is\nattractive, it has proven to be fraught.\n\nThe temptation to take meaning and information to amount to pretty\nmuch the same thing is a result of the following idea. The idea is\nthat the word \u2018cat\u2019 denotes the property of being a cat,\nand that it means cat because it expresses the concept cat,\nand the concept cat\nmeans cat. The concept cat means\ncat because it carries the information\n\\(\\langle\\)cat\\(\\rangle\\), and cat carries the\ninformation \\(\\langle\\)cat\\(\\rangle\\) because its instances or\ntokenings are caused, by and large, by cats. This is a nice idea. By\ntying meaning and information together and telling a causal\nstory about them, we have a naturalistic story to tell about the\ninformation that we get from our environment, and hence a naturalistic\nstory to tell about meaning. Such information-transmitting causal\nrelationships are information channels\u2014causal\nconnections that facilitate the flow of information between the source\nof information and the receiver. We should take care to note this\nstory is telling an informationally semantic story about\nsub-propositionally located pieces of information such as the\npredicate \u2018cat\u2019 and paradigmatic uses of singular terms.\nAs such it sits outside of the domain described by the theories of\nsemantic and strongly semantic information described above. In spite\nof this, we will see that a refinement of this story turns on tracking\naccuracy, if not truth itself.\n\nIn a series of influential works on this area of informational\nsemantics, Jerry Fodor (1990), and Fred Dretske (1981) proposed a\ntheory of semantics very much like the one outlined above (see the\nentry on\n causal theories of mental content).\n A noted problem for such an informational semantics has come to be\nknown commonly as the disjunction problem. The disjunction\nproblem is as follows. cat tokens are not\nalways caused by cats, they are sometimes caused by other things like\nsmall dogs for example (or by thoughts about balls of yarn or\nwhatever). Given this fact, if the story above is correct, then why\ndoes cat mean cat and not cat or\ndog? Fodor\u2019s (1990) response is in two stages.\n\nFirstly, Fodor\u2019s initial proposal is that non cat-caused tokens\nof cat are asymmetrically dependent on\ncat-caused tokens of cat. That is, there would\nnot be any non cat-caused tokens of cat had\nthere not been any cat-caused tokens of cat.\nSecondly, on Fodor\u2019s picture, meaning and information come\napart. The information carried by a token of a concept\ncovaries with its cause, whereas the meaning of a token is\nwhat all of the concept\u2019s tokenings have in common\u2014the\ninner vehicles of our cat tokenings, or their\nMOPs. Note that Fodor is not, strictly speaking, subsuming information\nas part of meaning, but rather teasing them apart. Our failure to\nappreciate that meaning and information come apart is, according to\nFodor, a consequence of the fact that firstly, they are very often\ncoextensive, and that secondly, \u2018means\u2019 is a homonym for\nboth semantic content (meaning) and information-carrying. Consider the\nfollowing two uses of \u201cmeans\u201d:\n\nSmoke means fire.\n\u2018Smoke\u2019 means smoke.\n\n\nOn Fodor\u2019s view, the first use is in the sense of\ninformation-carrying only. Smoke carries the information that there is\nfire, but that is not what it means semantically. What\n\u2018smoke\u2019 means, in the semantic sense, is smoke,\nand this is captured by the latter use of \u201cmeans\u201d above.\nOn Fodor\u2019s story, just as with \u2018cat\u2019 above,\n\u2018smoke\u2019 means smoke because it expresses smoke,\nand tokenings of smoke\nare caused paradigmatically (but not always!)\nby smoke itself. The \u201cnot always\u201d qualification is covered\nby the asymmetric dependence condition above. So far so good, but what\nabout non-existent objects such as bunyips? Non bunyip-caused bunyip\ntokens of bunyip cannot be asymmetrically\ndependent on bunyip-caused bunyip tokens of bunyip\nbecause there are no bunyips around to cause\nanything at all.\n\nIn light of non-existent objects such as bunyips, and the\nmeaningfulness of bunyip tokens in spite of\nthere being no bunyips, Fodor adjusts his proposal so that meaning now\nrests on asymmetrical dependences among nomological relations\namong properties\u2014the property of being a bunyip for\nexample\u2014as opposed to actual causal relations between\nindividuals. Nomological relations are cashed out in terms of\ncounterfactuals, so what we have now is an informational semantics\nalong the lines of the following\u2014bunyip\nmeans bunyip because if there were bunyips, bunyips\nwould be the cause of bunyip tokens\non which all other causes would depend asymmetrically.\n\nRecall again that Fodor is teasing meaning and information apart.\nGareth Evans (1982) formulates a similar informational theory of\nmeaning, but one where information and MOPs are both subsumed within\nthe semantic story itself. For Evans, a full story about the meaning\nof thoughts about particular objects that are\u2014putatively at\nleast\u2014in the world, needs to take account of both the causal\norigins of the thought, as well as the MOP engendered by it. Evans\ncalls such thoughts information based particular thoughts,\nand such thoughts will be well grounded if and only if the\nobject satisfying the MOP and the object at the source-end of the\ncausal route are one and the same thing.\n\nWhat the Fodor/Dretske and Evans theories of informational semantics\nhave in common, is that they recognise that the meaning or\ncontent/object of a thought is robust across causal variation:\n\n\nWe want to be able to say that two informational states (states of\ndifferent persons) embody the same information, provided that they\nresult from the same initial informational event. (Evans 1982:\n128\u2013129)\n\nInformational theories\u2026appeal to reliable covariances while\nquantifying over the causal mechanisms by which these covariances are\nsustained. By doing so, they explain why information (indeed, why the\nvery same information ) can be transmitted over so many different\nkinds of channels. (Fodor 1990: 100)\n\n\nMoreover, although Evans did not put things in quite these terms,\nFodor, Dretske, and Evans all recognise information channels\nas robust entities in their own right.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Recanati (2012, 2016), has proposed a detailed version\nof informational semantics, his mental files theory, within\nwhich information channels play a central role. Recanati\u2019s\nmental files are cognitive counterparts to singular terms, and as such\nare referring concepts. Recanati\u2019s view looks very similar to\nEvan\u2019s information based particular thoughts at first glance.\nHowever, on Recanati\u2019s view, metal files contain information\nin the form of MOPs of an object\u2014be they given directly\nand experientially, or indirectly via descriptions\u2014their\nreference is not fixed by the information that they contain/their\nmodes of presentation. Rather, the reference of a metal file is fixed\nby the relations on which this file is based, and the\nreferent of a mental file will be the entity or object with which we\nare acquainted correctly in virtue of such relations obtaining. So\nRecanati is allowing that MOPs contain information themselves, rather\nthan restrict the role of information to the reference fixing relation\nitself (as do Evans and Fodor). The feature that identifies these\nrelations is that they are epistemically rewarding (ER)\nrelations. For Recanati, a relation is an ER relation in virtue of the\nfact that it is the sort of relation that makes the flow of\ninformation possible. In other words, ER relations are\ninformation channels.\n\nRecanati\u2019s ER relations draw heavily on Lewis\u2019s (1983)\nrelations of \u201cepistemic rapport\u201d\u2014causal chains that\nwould permit information flow, or information channels under another\nname. Both Recanati and Lewis recognise the disjunction problem by\nallowing that both information and misinformation may be transmitted\nalong information channels. Recanati\u2019s take is that the\nreference of a mental file is fixed by the object that sits at the\ndistal end of the information channel that contributes to the\ninformation that the mental file contains, irrespectively of the\n\u201cfit\u201d. Fit may of course be bad on account of noisy\nchannels and/or misidentification on the agent\u2019s behalf. As\nRecanati puts it:\n\n\nThe role of a mental file based on a certain acquaintance relation is\nto store information acquired in virtue of that relation. The\ninformation in question need not be veridical; we can think of it in\nterms, simply, of a list of predicates which the subject takes the\nreferent to satisfy. The referent need not actually satisfy the\npredicates in question, since the subject may be mistaken. Such\nmistakes are possible because what determines the reference is not the\ncontent of the file but the relevant relation to the object. The file\ncorresponds to an information channel, and the reference is the object\nfrom which the information derives, whether that information is\ngenuine information or misinformation. (2012: 37\u201338)\n\n\nIt reads here as though Recanati is conflating a mental file on the\none hand, with the information channel that carries its informational\npayload. Indeed Recanati goes on to argue that there are two sensible\nand \u201cdistinct notions of file\u201d (p. 82). The first notion\nis simply a repository of evolving information that appears to be and\nmay be about a single distinct object. The second notion of file, what\nRecanati calls the \u201cproper notion\u201d, involves both\na specific relevant information channel, and the repository\nof information acquired via that channel.\n\nAlong with Fodor, Dretske, Evans, Recanati, and Lewis, Frank Jackson\n(2010) also articulates a semantic theory based upon information\nchannels that supervene on causal relations, along with MOPs.\nJackson\u2019s MOPs are identified with descriptions.\nJackson\u2019s description theory of reference for proper names turns\non information channels, which are articulated in terms of causal\nlinks that underpin information flow. Jackson\u2019s motivating idea\nis that names are by and large sources of information about the\nentities that they name. The descriptive dimension is a function of\ntheir (the descriptions) being specified in terms of\ninformation-carrying causal connections\u2014information\nchannels.\n\nFor Jackson, language is, in general, a representational system that\ntransmits information about the way that things are taken to be to\nthose who comprehend the language. When names are used in declarative\nsentences, speakers are representing things as being a certain way.\nThe use of names in such contexts is to deliver putative information\nabout the way things are to other speakers in the language community.\nAccording to Jackson, names do this as a function of their being parts\nof information channels that exist between users of the language, and\nthe world. In order for us to track the information channel itself for\nthe purposes of getting information from it, we must understand the\nstructured connection between linguistic items (words and sentences),\nand ways that the world might be. Names themselves facilitate this\npractice in virtue of their being elements in the information channels\nthat exist between us and the world. These channels are created by\nconventions of language use and established practices of baptism.\n\nGiven the ubiquity of information channels in the theories above, it\nis no surprise that information channels have become a topic of study\non their own terms. The theory of information channels has made\ncontributions to information-based analysis of natural language and\nformal semantics.\n",
