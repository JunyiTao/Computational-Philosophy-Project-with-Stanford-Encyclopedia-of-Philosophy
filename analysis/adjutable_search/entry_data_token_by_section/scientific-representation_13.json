    "main_text": "The Fiction View of Models\n6. The Fiction View of Models\n\nA recent family of approaches analyses models by drawing an analogy\nbetween models and literary fiction. This analogy can be used in two\nways, yielding two different version of the fiction view. The first is\nprimarily motivated by ontological considerations rather than the\nquestion of scientific representation per se. Scientific\ndiscourse is rife with passages that appear to be descriptions of\nsystems in a particular discipline, and the pages of textbooks and\njournals are filled with discussions of the properties and the\nbehaviour of those systems. In mechanics, for instance, the dynamical\nproperties of a system consisting of three spinning spheres with\nhomogenous mass distributions are the focus of attention; in biology\ninfinite populations are investigated; and in economics perfectly\nrational agents with access to perfect information exchange goods.\nTheir surface structure notwithstanding, no one would mistake\ndescriptions of such systems as descriptions of an actual\nsystem: we know very well that there are no such systems.\n\nThomson-Jones (2010: 284) refers to such a description as a\n\u201cdescription of a missing system\u201d. These descriptions are\nembedded in what he calls the \u201cface value practice\u201d (2010:\n285) the practice of talking and thinking about these systems as if\nthey were real. The face-value practice raises a number of questions.\nWhat account should be given of these descriptions and what sort of\nobjects, if any, do they describe? Are we putting forward\ntruth-evaluable claims when putting forward descriptions of missing\nsystems?\n\nThe fiction view of models provides an answer: models are akin to\nplaces and characters in literary fiction and claims about them are\ntrue or false in the same way in which claims about these places and\ncharacters are true or false. Such a position has been recently\ndefended explicitly by some authors (Frigg 2010a,b; Frigg and Nguyen\n2021; Godfrey-Smith 2006; Salis 2021), but not without opposition\n(Giere 2009; Magnani 2012). It does bear noting that the analogy has\nbeen around for a while (Cartwright 1983; McCloskey 1990; Vaihinger\n1911 [1924]). This leaves the thorny issue of how to analyse fictional\nplaces and characters. Here philosophers of science can draw on\ndiscussions from aesthetics to fill in the details about these\nquestions (Friend 2007 and Salis 2013 provide useful reviews).\n\nThe second version of the fiction view explicitly focuses on\nrepresentation. Most theories of representation we have encountered so\nfar posit that there are model systems and construe scientific\nrepresentation as a relation between two entities, the model system\nand the target system. Toon calls this the indirect view of\nrepresentation (2012: 43). Indeed, Weisberg (2007) views this\nindirectness as the defining feature of modelling (see also Knuuttila\nand Loettgers 2017). This view contrasts with what Toon (2012: 43) and\nLevy (2015: 790) call a direct view of representation. This\nview does not recognise model systems instead aims to explain\nrepresentation as a form of direct description. On this view, models\nprovide an \u201cimaginative description of real things\u201d (Levy\n2012: 741) such as actual pendula, and there is no such thing as a\nmodel system of which the pendulum description is literally true (Toon\n2012: 43\u201344).\n\nBoth Toon (2012) and Levy (2015) articulate the direct view by drawing\non Walton\u2019s (1990) theory of make-believe. At the heart of this\ntheory is the notion of a game of make-believe (see the SEP entry on\n imagination\n for further discussion). We play such a game if, for instance, when\nwalking through a forest we imagine that stumps are bears and if we\nspot a stump we imagine that we spot a bear. In Walton\u2019s\nterminology the stumps are props, and the rule that we\nimagine a bear when we see a stump is a principle of\ngeneration. Together a prop and principle of generation prescribe\nwhat is to be imagined. Walton considers a vast variety of different\nprops, including statues and works of literary fiction. Toon focuses\non the particular kind of game in which we are prescribed to imagine\nsomething of a real world object. A statue showing Napoleon on\nhorseback (Toon 2012: 37) is a prop mandating us to imagine, for\ninstance, that Napoleon has a certain physiognomy and certain facial\nexpressions. When reading The War of the Worlds (2012: 39) we\nare prescribed to imagine that the dome of St Paul\u2019s Cathedral\nhas been attacked by aliens and now has a gaping hole on its western\nside.\n\nThe crucial move is to say that models are props in games of make\nbelieve. Specifically, material models are like the statue of Napoleon\nand theoretical models are like the text of The War of the\nWorlds: both prescribe, in their own way, to imagine something\nabout a real object. A ball-and-stick model of a methane molecule\nprescribes us to imagine particular things about methane, and a model\ndescription describing a point mass bob bouncing on a perfectly\nelastic spring represents the real ball and spring system by\nprescribing imaginings about the real system. This provides the\nfollowing answer to the ER-problem (Toon 2012: 62):\n\nDirect Representation: \\(M\\) is a scientific representation\nof \\(T\\) iff \\(M\\) functions as prop in game of make-believe which\nprescribes imaginings about \\(T\\).\n\nThis account solves some of the problems posed in\n Section 1:\n Direct Representation is asymmetrical, makes room for\nmisrepresentation, and, given its roots in aesthetics, it renounces\nthe Demarcation Problem. The view absolves the Problem of Ontology\nsince models are either physical objects or descriptions, neither or\nwhich are problematic in this context. Toon remains silent on both the\nProblem of Style, and the applicability of mathematics.\n\nImportant questions remain. According to Direct\nRepresentation models prescribe us to imagine certain things\nabout their target system. The account remains silent, however, on the\nrelationship between what a model prescribes us to imagine and what a\nmodel user should actually infer about the target system, and so it\noffers no answer to the ER-problem. Levy (2015) identifies this as a\ngap in Toon\u2019s account and proposes to fill it by invoking\nYablo\u2019s (2014) notion of \u201cpartial truth\u201d, the idea\nbeing that a model user should take the imagined propositions to be\npartially true of their target systems. However, as Levy admits, there\nare other sorts of cases that don\u2019t fit the mould, most notably\ndistortive idealisations. These require a different treatment and\nit\u2019s an open question what this treatment would be.\n\nA further worry is how Direct Representation deals with\ntargetless models. If there is no target system, then what does the\nmodel prescribe imaginings about? Toon is well aware of such models\nand suggests the following solution: if a model has no target it\nprescribes imaginings about a fictional character (2012: 76). This\nsolution, however, comes with ontological costs, and one of the\ndeclared aims of the direct view was to avoid such costs by removing\nmodel systems from the picture. Levy (2015) aims to salvage\nontological parsimony and proposes a radical move: there are no\ntargetless models. If a (purported) model has no target then it is not\na model. There remains a question, however, how this view can be\nsquared with scientific practice where targetless models are not only\ncommon but also clearly acknowledged as such.\n",
