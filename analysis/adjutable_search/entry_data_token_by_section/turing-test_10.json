Perhaps it is intended to be tongue-in-cheek, though, if it is,\nthis fact is poorly signposted by Turing. Perhaps, instead, Turing was\ninfluenced by the apparently scientifically respectable results of J.\nB. Rhine. At any rate, taking the text at face value, Turing seems to\nhave thought that there was overwhelming empirical evidence for\ntelepathy (and he was also prepared to take clairvoyance, precognition\nand psychokinesis seriously). Moreover, he also seems to have thought\nthat if the human participant in the game was telepathic, then the\ninterrogator could exploit this fact in order to determine the\nidentity of the machine\u2014and, in order to circumvent this\ndifficulty, Turing proposes that the competitors should be housed in a\n\u201ctelepathy-proof room.\u201d Leaving aside the point that, as a\nmatter of fact, there is no current statistical support for\ntelepathy\u2014or clairvoyance, or precognition, or\ntelekinesis\u2014it is worth asking what kind of theory of the nature\nof telepathy would have appealed to Turing. After all, if humans can\nbe telepathic, why shouldn\u2019t digital computers be so as well? If\nthe capacity for telepathy were a standard feature of any sufficiently\nadvanced system that is able to carry out human conversation, then\nthere is no in-principle reason why digital computers could not be the\nequals of human beings in this respect as well. (Perhaps this response\nassumes that a successful machine participant in the imitation game\nwill need to be equipped with sensors, etc. However, as we noted\nabove, this assumption is not terribly controversial. A plausible\nconversationalist has to keep up to date with goings-on in the\nworld.)\n\nAfter discussing the nine objections mentioned above, Turing goes on\nto say that he has \u201cno very convincing arguments of a positive\nnature to support my views. If I had I should not have taken such\npains to point out the fallacies in contrary views.\u201d (454)\nPerhaps Turing sells himself a little short in this self-assessment.\nFirst of all\u2014as his brief discussion of solipsism makes\nclear\u2014it is worth asking what grounds we have for attributing\nintelligence (thought, mind) to other people. If it is plausible to\nsuppose that we base our attributions on behavioral tests or\nbehavioral criteria, then his claim about the appropriate test to\napply in the case of machines seems apt, and his conjecture that\ndigital computing machines might pass the test seems like a\nreasonable\u2014though controversial\u2014empirical conjecture.\nSecond, subsequent developments in the philosophy of mind\u2014and,\nin particular, the fashioning of functionalist theories of the\nmind\u2014have provided a more secure theoretical environment in\nwhich to place speculations about the possibility of thinking\nmachines. If mental states are functional states\u2014and if mental\nstates are capable of realisation in vastly different kinds of\nmaterials\u2014then there is some reason to think that it is an\nempirical question whether minds can be realised in digital computing\nmachines. Of course, this kind of suggestion is open to challenge; we\nshall consider some important philosophical objections in the later\nparts of this review.\n",
