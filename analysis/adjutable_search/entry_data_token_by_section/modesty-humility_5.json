    "main_text": "Doxastic Accounts || Ignorance\n2.1 Ignorance\n\n\nJulia Driver\u2019s account of modesty kicked off a modern revival in\nwork on the virtue. For Driver (1989 and 2001), the modest person is\nsomeone who is ignorant of their own good qualities in certain ways.\nThis was hinted at, but not developed, by Henry Sidgwick:\n\u201chumility prescribes a low opinion of our merits: but if our\nmerits are comparably high, it seems strange to direct us to have a\nlow opinion of them\u201d (1907/1981, 334). He later denies that\nthere is anything virtuous about having a low self-opinion, but Driver\ndevelops this idea and discusses a range of moral virtues that require\nignorance: blind charity (seeing the good in others while remaining\nignorant of the bad), impulsive courage, certain refusals to hold\ngrudges, some types of innocence, and of course, modesty.\n\n\nDriver\u2019s account is sometimes called an \u2018ignorance\u2019\naccount and other times an \u2018underestimation\u2019 account as\nthe modest person need not be completely ignorant of their own good\nqualities, just underestimate them. As she points out (1999, 828),\nthis need not require a low estimation as one can underestimate a good\nquality while still thinking it pretty good overall. The modest\nperson, on this account, is someone who wrongly believes that they are\nnot as good as they really are in some respect. This is taken to\nexplain the key features of modesty: it is a dependent virtue since\nthere is another quality one is ignorant of, it is not purely\nbehavioral so allows for false modesty, and it recognizes\nself-attribution strangeness, since modesty itself is a good\nquality.\n\n\nThis account is set against the background of a more general account\nof virtue. Driver defends a consequentialist account of virtue where\ntraits are virtuous when they, in general, produce good effects\n(Driver, 2001). This view of virtue makes it easy to accommodate\nmorally virtuous traits that involve epistemic defects since some\nepistemic defects might turn out to produce better effects in the long\nrun.\n Accounts of virtue inspired by Aristotle,\n however, make virtue a matter of\npractical wisdom which makes moral virtue incompatible with epistemic\ndefects. It\u2019s important to note that while Driver\u2019s early\nwork makes modesty require ignorance, the weaker claim that moral\nvirtue is compatible with ignorance is enough to make problems for\nAristotelian accounts of virtue (see Driver 1999). Accuracy accounts of\nmodesty and humility are largely responses to Driver that are typically\nmotivated to deny the idea that moral virtue can require, or even be\ncompatible with, ignorance and false belief.\n",
