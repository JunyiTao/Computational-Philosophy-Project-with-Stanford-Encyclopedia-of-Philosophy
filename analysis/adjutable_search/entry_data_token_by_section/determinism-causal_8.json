    "main_text": "The Epistemology of Determinism || Laws again\n3.1 Laws again\n\nAs we saw above, for determinism to be true there have to be\nsome laws of nature. Most philosophers and scientists since the\n17th century have indeed thought that there are. But in the\nface of more recent skepticism, how can it be proven that there are?\nAnd if this hurdle can be overcome, don\u2019t we have to know, with\ncertainty, precisely what the laws of our world are, in order\nto tackle the question of determinism\u2019s truth or falsity?\n\nThe first hurdle can perhaps be overcome by a combination of\nmetaphysical argument and appeal to knowledge we already have of the\nphysical world. Philosophers are currently pursuing this issue\nactively, in large part due to the efforts of the anti-laws minority.\nThe debate has been most recently framed by Cartwright in The\nDappled World (Cartwright 1999) in terms psychologically\nadvantageous to her anti-laws cause. Those who believe in the\nexistence of traditional, universal laws of nature are\nfundamentalists; those who disbelieve are\npluralists. This terminology seems to be becoming standard\n(see Belot 2001), so the first task in the epistemology of determinism\nis for fundamentalists to establish the reality of laws of nature (see\nHoefer 2002b).\n\nEven if the first hurdle can be overcome, the second, namely\nestablishing precisely what the actual laws are, may seem daunting\nindeed. In a sense, what we are asking for is precisely what\n19th and 20th century physicists sometimes set\nas their goal: the Final Theory of Everything. But perhaps, as Newton\nsaid of establishing the solar system\u2019s absolute motion,\n\u201cthe thing is not altogether desperate.\u201d Many physicists\nin the past 60 years or so have been convinced of determinism\u2019s\nfalsity, because they were convinced that (a) whatever the Final\nTheory is, it will be some recognizable variant of the family of\nquantum mechanical theories; and (b) all quantum mechanical theories\nare non-deterministic. Both (a) and (b) are highly debatable, but the\npoint is that one can see how arguments in favor of these positions\nmight be mounted. The same was true in the 19th century,\nwhen theorists might have argued that (a) whatever the Final Theory\nis, it will involve only continuous fluids and solids governed by\npartial differential equations; and (b) all such theories are\ndeterministic. (Here, (b) is almost certainly false; see Earman\n(1986),ch. XI). Even if we now are not, we may in future be in a\nposition to mount a credible argument for or against determinism on\nthe grounds of features we think we know the Final Theory must\nhave.\n",
