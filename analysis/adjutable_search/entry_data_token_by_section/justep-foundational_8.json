    "main_text": "Objections to Classical Foundationalism || The Threat of Skepticism\n3.4 The Threat of Skepticism\n\nAlthough opponents of classical foundationalism are not always eager\nto admit it, we suspect that the primary dissatisfaction with\nclassical foundationalism lies with the difficulty the view has\navoiding radical skepticism. On infallible belief, infallible\njustification, or direct acquaintance theories of foundational\njustification, there is precious little included in the foundations of\nknowledge. Most classical foundationalists reject the idea that one\ncan have noninferentially justified beliefs about the past, but the\npresent disappears into the past in the blink of an eye. How can one\neven hope to get back the vast body of knowledge one\npre-philosophically supposes one has, if one\u2019s epistemic base is\nso impoverished? If the second clause of the Principle of Inferential\nJustification were accepted, the problem is even more serious. One\nmight be able to convince oneself that one can know noninferentially\nthe principles of deductive reasoning, but deduction will not take one\nusefully beyond the foundations of knowledge and justified belief. As\nMill (1906: 126) argued, there is a very real sense in which one\ndoesn\u2019t advance one\u2019s knowledge significantly employing a\nform of reasoning that takes one only to conclusions that were\nimplicitly contained in the conjunction of one\u2019s premises. To\nadvance beyond foundations we will inevitably need to employ\nnon-deductive reasoning and according to PIJ that will ultimately\nrequire us to have noninferential knowledge of propositions describing\nprobability connections between evidence and conclusions that are not\nlogically implied by the evidence. It is not absurd on the face of it\nto suppose that one can have noninferential a priori\nknowledge of probabilistic connections, but it is perhaps an\nunderstatement to say that the view is not popular (see Russell 1948\nfor an excellent discussion of this issue).\n",
