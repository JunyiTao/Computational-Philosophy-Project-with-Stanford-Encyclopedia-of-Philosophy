    "main_text": "Conceptualizing and Measuring Access to Care\n2. Conceptualizing and Measuring Access to Care\n\nArguably, the goal of universal access to health care, as embodied in\nhealth systems in nearly all developed countries, is to secure equal\nor at least equitable access to needed care. How can we tell whether\nor not access to care is equal? What should we count as equitable\naccess, if this involves departures from equal access? We might hope\nthat it is relatively unproblematic to determine when access to care\nis equal, as it is, for example, with income, and that equitable\naccess would then consist of allowable or justifiable inequalities in\naccess. As we shall see in this Section, giving an account of equal\naccess, let alone equitable access, is not so easy.\n\nConceptualizing and measuring access to care is more complex a task\nthan it might seem at first. In part, this is because health care is\nnon-homogeneous in its function, for it does quite different things\nfor us. In addition, there is disagreement about the nature of health\ncare as a social good: some think it is just a commodity, to be\npurchased in a market like other commodities; others claim it has a\nspecial moral importance that distinguishes it from some other market\ngoods. If we are to make sense out of claims that we owe each other\nequal or at least equitable access to care, and this means we must\novercome various barriers to access to care that create inequitable\naccess, then we need to be clear how to determine when access is\nunequal or unjustifiably unequal.\n",
