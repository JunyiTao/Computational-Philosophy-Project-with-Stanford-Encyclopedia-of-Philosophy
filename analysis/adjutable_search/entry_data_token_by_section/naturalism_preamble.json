    "main_text": "\nThe term \u201cnaturalism\u201d has no very precise meaning in\ncontemporary philosophy. Its current usage derives from debates in\nAmerica in the first half of the last century. The self-proclaimed\n\u201cnaturalists\u201d from that period included John Dewey, Ernest\nNagel, Sidney Hook and Roy Wood Sellars. These philosophers aimed to\nally philosophy more closely with science. They urged that reality is\nexhausted by nature, containing nothing \u201csupernatural\u201d,\nand that the scientific method should be used to investigate all areas\nof reality, including the \u201chuman spirit\u201d (Krikorian 1944,\nKim 2003).\nSo understood, \u201cnaturalism\u201d is not a particularly\ninformative term as applied to contemporary philosophers. The great\nmajority of contemporary philosophers would happily accept naturalism\nas just characterized\u2014that is, they would both reject\n\u201csupernatural\u201d entities, and allow that science is a\npossible route (if not necessarily the only one) to important truths\nabout the \u201chuman spirit\u201d.\nEven so, this entry will not aim to pin down any more informative\ndefinition of \u201cnaturalism\u201d. It would be fruitless to try\nto adjudicate some official way of understanding the term. Different\ncontemporary philosophers interpret \u201cnaturalism\u201d\ndifferently. This disagreement about usage is no accident. For better\nor worse, \u201cnaturalism\u201d is widely viewed as a positive\nterm in philosophical circles\u2014only a minority of philosophers nowadays\nare happy to announce themselves as\n\u201cnon-naturalists\u201d.[1]\n This inevitably leads to a divergence in\nunderstanding the requirements of \u201cnaturalism\u201d. Those\nphilosophers with relatively weak naturalist commitments are inclined\nto understand \u201cnaturalism\u201d in a unrestrictive way, in\norder not to disqualify themselves as \u201cnaturalists\u201d,\nwhile those who uphold stronger naturalist doctrines are happy to set\nthe bar for \u201cnaturalism\u201d\nhigher.[2]\nRather than getting bogged down in an essentially definitional\nissue, this entry will adopt a different strategy. It will outline a\nrange of philosophical commitments of a generally naturalist stamp,\nand comment on their philosophical cogency. The primary focus will be\non whether these commitments should be upheld, rather than on whether\nthey are definitive of \u201cnaturalism\u201d. The important thing\nis to articulate and assess the reasoning that has led philosophers in\na generally naturalist direction, not to stipulate how far you need to\ntravel along this path before you can count yourself as a paid-up\n\u201cnaturalist\u201d.\nAs indicated by the above characterization of the\nmid-twentieth-century American movement, naturalism can be separated\ninto an ontological and a methodological component. The ontological\ncomponent is concerned with the contents of reality, asserting that\nreality has no place for \u201csupernatural\u201d or other\n\u201cspooky\u201d kinds of entity. By contrast, the methodological\ncomponent is concerned with ways of investigating reality, and\nclaims some kind of general authority for the scientific method.\nCorrespondingly, this entry will have two main sections, the first\ndevoted to ontological naturalism, the second to methodological\nnaturalism.\nOf course, naturalist commitments of both ontological and\nmethodological kinds can be significant in areas other than\nphilosophy.  The modern history of psychology, biology, social science\nand even physics itself can usefully be seen as hinging on changing\nattitudes to naturalist ontological principles and naturalist\nmethodological precepts. This entry, however, will be concerned solely\nwith naturalist doctrines that are specific to philosophy. So the\nfirst part of this entry, on ontological naturalism, will be concerned\nspecifically with views about the general contents of reality that are\nmotivated by philosophical argument and analysis. And the second part,\non methodological naturalism, will focus specifically on\nmethodological debates that bear on philosophical practice, and in\nparticular on the relationship between philosophy and science.\n",
