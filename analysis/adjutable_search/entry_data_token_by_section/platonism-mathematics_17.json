    "main_text": "Between object realism and mathematical platonism || Plenitudious platonism\n4.2 Plenitudious platonism\n\nOne lightweight form of object realism is the \u201cfull-blooded\nplatonism\u201d of Balaguer 1998. This view is characterized by a\nplenitude principle to the effect that any mathematical\nobjects that could exist actually do exist. For instance, since the\nContinuum Hypothesis is independent of the standard axiomatization of\nset theory, there is a universe of sets in which the hypothesis is\ntrue and another in which it is false. And neither universe is\nmetaphysically privileged (Hamkins 2012). By contrast, traditional\nplatonism asserts that there is a unique universe of sets in which the\nContinuum Hypothesis is either determinately true or determinately\n false.[15]\n\nOne alleged benefit of this plenitudinous view is in the epistemology\nof mathematics. If every consistent mathematical theory is true of\nsome universe of mathematical objects, then mathematical knowledge\nwill, in some sense, be easy to obtain: provided that our mathematical\ntheories are consistent, they are guaranteed to be true of some\nuniverse of mathematical objects.\n\nHowever, \u201cfull-blooded platonism\u201d has received much\ncriticism. Colyvan and Zalta 1999 criticize it for undermining the\npossibility of reference to mathematical objects, and Restall 2003,\nfor lacking a precise and coherent formulation of the plenitude\nprinciple on which the view is based. Martin (2001) proposes that\ndifferent universes of sets be amalgamated to yield a single maximal\nuniverse, which will be privileged by fitting our conception of set\nbetter than any other universe of sets.\n\nA different version of plenitudinous platonism is developed in Linsky\n& Zalta 1995 and a series of further articles. (See, for instance,\nLinsky & Zalta 2006 and other articles cited therein.) Traditional\nplatonism goes wrong by \u201cconceiv[ing] of abstract objects on the\nmodel of physical objects\u201d (Linsky & Zalta 1995, p. 533),\nincluding in particular the idea that such objects are\n\u201csparse\u201d rather than plenitudinous. Linsky & Zalta\ndevelop an alternative approach on the basis of the second\nauthor\u2019s \u201cobject theory\u201d. The main feature of object\ntheory is a very general comprehension principle which asserts the\nexistence of a plenitude of abstract objects: for any collection of\nproperties, there is an abstract object which \u201cencodes\u201d\nprecisely these properties. In object theory, moreover, two abstract\nobjects are identical just in case they encode precisely the same\nproperties. Object theory\u2019s comprehension principle and identity\ncriterion are said to \u201cprovide the link between our cognitive\nfaculty of understanding and abstract objects\u201d (ibid.,\np. 547). (See Ebert & Rossberg 2007 for critical discussion.)\n",
