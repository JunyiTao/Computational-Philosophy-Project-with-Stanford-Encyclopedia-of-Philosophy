Introduction: the many roles of analogy\n\nAnalogies are widely recognized as playing an important\nheuristic role, as aids to discovery. They have been\nemployed, in a wide variety of settings and with considerable success,\nto generate insight and to formulate possible solutions to problems.\nAccording to Joseph Priestley, a pioneer in chemistry and\nelectricity,\n\n\nanalogy is our best guide in all philosophical investigations; and all\ndiscoveries, which were not made by mere accident, have been made by\nthe help of it. (1769/1966: 14)\n\n\nPriestley may be over-stating the case, but there is no doubt that\nanalogies have suggested fruitful lines of inquiry in many fields.\nBecause of their heuristic value, analogies and analogical reasoning\nhave been a particular focus of AI research. H\u00e1jek (2018)\nexamines analogy as a heuristic tool in philosophy.\n\nAnalogies have a related (and not entirely separable)\njustificatory role. This role is most obvious where an\nanalogical argument is explicitly offered in support of some\nconclusion. The intended degree of support for the conclusion can vary\nconsiderably. At one extreme, these arguments can be strongly\npredictive. For example:\n\n\nExample 1.\nHydrodynamic analogies exploit mathematical similarities\nbetween the equations governing ideal fluid flow and torsional\nproblems. To predict stresses in a planned structure, one can\nconstruct a fluid model, i.e., a system of pipes through which water\npasses (Timoshenko and Goodier 1970). Within the limits of\nidealization, such analogies allow us to make demonstrative\ninferences, for example, from a measured quantity in the fluid model\nto the analogous value in the torsional problem. In practice, there\nare numerous complications (Sterrett 2006).\n\nAt the other extreme, an analogical argument may provide very weak\nsupport for its conclusion, establishing no more than minimal\nplausibility. Consider:\n\nExample 2.\n Thomas Reid\u2019s (1785) argument for the existence of life on\nother planets (Stebbing 1933; Mill 1843/1930; Robinson 1930; Copi\n1961). Reid notes a number of similarities between Earth and the other\nplanets in our solar system: all orbit and are illuminated by the sun;\nseveral have moons; all revolve on an axis. In consequence, he\nconcludes, it is \u201cnot unreasonable to think, that those planets\nmay, like our earth, be the habitation of various orders of living\ncreatures\u201d (1785: 24).\n\nSuch modesty is not uncommon. Often the point of an analogical\nargument is just to persuade people to take an idea seriously. For\ninstance:\n\n\nExample 3.\n Darwin takes himself to be using an analogy between artificial and\nnatural selection to argue for the plausibility of the latter:\n\n\nWhy may I not invent the hypothesis of Natural Selection (which from\nthe analogy of domestic productions, and from what we know of the\nstruggle of existence and of the variability of organic beings, is, in\nsome very slight degree, in itself probable) and try whether this\nhypothesis of Natural Selection does not explain (as I think it does)\na large number of facts\u2026. (Letter to Henslow, May 1860\nin Darwin 1903)\n\n\nHere it appears, by Darwin\u2019s own admission, that his analogy is\nemployed to show that the hypothesis is probable to some \u201cslight\ndegree\u201d and thus merits further investigation. Some, however,\nreject this characterization of Darwin\u2019s reasoning (Richards\n1997; Gildenhuys 2004).\n\n\nSometimes analogical reasoning is the only available form of\njustification for a hypothesis. The method of ethnographic\nanalogy is used to interpret\n\n\nthe nonobservable behaviour of the ancient inhabitants of an\narchaeological site (or ancient culture) based on the similarity of\ntheir artifacts to those used by living peoples. (Hunter and Whitten\n1976: 147)\n\n\nFor example:\n\nExample 4.\n Shelley (1999, 2003) describes how ethnographic analogy was used to\ndetermine the probable significance of odd markings on the necks of\nMoche clay pots found in the Peruvian Andes. Contemporary potters in\nPeru use these marks (called s\u00edgnales) to indicate\nownership; the marks enable them to reclaim their work when several\npotters share a kiln or storage facility. Analogical reasoning may be\nthe only avenue of inference to the past in such cases, though this\npoint is subject to dispute (Gould and Watson 1982; Wylie 1982, 1985).\nAnalogical reasoning may have similar significance for cosmological\nphenomena that are inaccessible due to limits on observation\n(Dardashti et al. 2017). See\n \u00a75.1\n for further discussion.\n\nAs philosophers and historians such as Kuhn (1996) have repeatedly\npointed out, there is not always a clear separation between the two\nroles that we have identified, discovery and justification. Indeed,\nthe two functions are blended in what we might call the\nprogrammatic (or paradigmatic) role of analogy: over\na period of time, an analogy can shape the development of a program of\nresearch. For example:\n\n\nExample 5.\n An \u2018acoustical analogy\u2019 was employed for many years by\ncertain nineteenth-century physicists investigating spectral lines.\nDiscrete spectra were thought to be\n\n\ncompletely analogous to the acoustical situation, with atoms (and/or\nmolecules) serving as oscillators originating or absorbing the\nvibrations in the manner of resonant tuning forks. (Maier 1981:\n51)\n\n\nGuided by this analogy, physicists looked for groups of spectral lines\nthat exhibited frequency patterns characteristic of a harmonic\noscillator. This analogy served not only to underwrite the\nplausibility of conjectures, but also to guide and limit\ndiscovery by pointing scientists in certain directions.\n\n\nMore generally, analogies can play an important programmatic role by\nguiding conceptual development (see\n \u00a75.2).\n In some cases, a programmatic analogy culminates in the theoretical\nunification of two different areas of inquiry.\n\nExample 6.\n Descartes\u2019s (1637/1954) correlation between geometry and\nalgebra provided methods for systematically handling geometrical\nproblems that had long been recognized as analogous. A very different\nrelationship between analogy and discovery exists when a programmatic\nanalogy breaks down, as was the ultimate fate of the acoustical\nanalogy. That atomic spectra have an entirely different explanation\nbecame clear with the advent of quantum theory. In this case, novel\ndiscoveries emerged against background expectations shaped by\nthe guiding analogy. There is a third possibility: an unproductive or\nmisleading programmatic analogy may simply become entrenched and\nself-perpetuating as it leads us to \u201cconstruct\u2026 data that\nconform to it\u201d (Stepan 1996: 133). Arguably, the danger of this\nthird possibility provides strong motivation for developing a critical\naccount of analogical reasoning and analogical arguments.\n\nAnalogical cognition, which embraces all cognitive processes\ninvolved in discovering, constructing and using analogies, is broader\nthan analogical reasoning (Hofstadter 2001; Hofstadter and Sander\n2013). Understanding these processes is an important objective of\ncurrent cognitive science research, and an objective that generates\nmany questions. How do humans identify analogies? Do nonhuman animals\nuse analogies in ways similar to humans? How do analogies and\nmetaphors influence concept formation?\n\nThis entry, however, concentrates specifically on analogical\narguments. Specifically, it focuses on three central epistemological\nquestions:\n\nWhat criteria should we use to evaluate analogical arguments?\nWhat philosophical justification can be provided for analogical\ninferences?\nHow do analogical arguments fit into a broader inferential context\n(i.e., how do we combine them with other forms of inference),\nespecially theoretical confirmation?\n\n\nFollowing a preliminary discussion of the basic structure of\nanalogical arguments, the entry reviews selected attempts to provide\nanswers to these three questions. To find such answers would\nconstitute an important first step towards understanding the nature of\nanalogical reasoning. To isolate these questions, however, is to make\nthe non-trivial assumption that there can be a theory of\nanalogical arguments\u2014an assumption which, as we shall\nsee, is attacked in different ways by both philosophers and cognitive\nscientists.\n2. Analogical arguments \n2.1 Examples\n\nAnalogical arguments vary greatly in subject matter, strength and\nlogical structure. In order to appreciate this variety, it is helpful\nto increase our stock of examples. First, a geometric example:\n\nExample 7\n (Rectangles and boxes). Suppose that you have established that of all\nrectangles with a fixed perimeter, the square has maximum area. By\nanalogy, you conjecture that of all boxes with a fixed surface area,\nthe cube has maximum volume.\n\nTwo examples from the history of science:\n\nExample 8\n (Morphine and meperidine). In 1934, the pharmacologist Schaumann was\ntesting synthetic compounds for their anti-spasmodic effect. These\ndrugs had a chemical structure similar to morphine. He observed that\none of the compounds\u2014meperidine, also known as\nDemerol\u2014had a physical effect on mice that was\npreviously observed only with morphine: it induced an S-shaped tail\ncurvature. By analogy, he conjectured that the drug might also share\nmorphine\u2019s narcotic effects. Testing on rats, rabbits, dogs and\neventually humans showed that meperidine, like morphine, was an\neffective pain-killer (Lembeck 1989: 11; Reynolds and Randall 1975:\n273).\n\nExample 9\n (Priestley on electrostatic force). In 1769, Priestley suggested that\nthe absence of electrical influence inside a hollow charged spherical\nshell was evidence that charges attract and repel with an inverse\nsquare force. He supported his hypothesis by appealing to the\nanalogous situation of zero gravitational force inside a hollow shell\nof uniform density.\n\nFinally, an example from legal reasoning:\n\nExample 10\n (Duty of reasonable care). In a much-cited case (Donoghue v.\nStevenson 1932 AC 562), the United Kingdom House of Lords found\nthe manufacturer of a bottle of ginger beer liable for damages to a\nconsumer who became ill as a result of a dead snail in the bottle. The\ncourt argued that the manufacturer had a duty to take\n\u201creasonable care\u201d in creating a product that could\nforeseeably result in harm to the consumer in the absence of such\ncare, and where the consumer had no possibility of intermediate\nexamination. The principle articulated in this famous case was\nextended, by analogy, to allow recovery for harm against an\nengineering firm whose negligent repair work caused the collapse of a\nlift (Haseldine v. CA Daw & Son Ltd. 1941 2 KB 343). By\ncontrast, the principle was not applicable to a case where a workman\nwas injured by a defective crane, since the workman had opportunity to\nexamine the crane and was even aware of the defects (Farr v.\nButters Brothers & Co. 1932 2 KB 606).\n2.2 Characterization\n\nWhat, if anything, do all of these examples have in common? We begin\nwith a simple, quasi-formal characterization. Similar formulations are\nfound in elementary critical thinking texts (e.g., Copi and Cohen\n2005) and in the literature on argumentation theory (e.g., Govier\n1999, Guarini 2004, Walton and Hyra 2018). An analogical argument has\nthe following form:\n\n\\(S\\) is similar to \\(T\\) in certain (known) respects.\n\\(S\\) has some further feature \\(Q\\).\nTherefore, \\(T\\) also has the feature \\(Q\\), or some feature\n\\(Q^*\\) similar to \\(Q\\).\n\n\n(1) and (2) are premises. (3) is the conclusion of the argument. The\nargument form is ampliative; the conclusion is not guaranteed\nto follow from the premises.\n\n\\(S\\) and \\(T\\) are referred to as the source domain and\ntarget domain, respectively. A domain is a set of\nobjects, properties, relations and functions, together with a set of\naccepted statements about those objects, properties, relations and\nfunctions. More formally, a domain consists of a set of objects and an\ninterpreted set of statements about them. The statements need not\nbelong to a first-order language, but to keep things simple, any\nformalizations employed here will be first-order. We use unstarred\nsymbols \\((a, P, R, f)\\) to refer to items in the source domain and\nstarred symbols \\((a^*, P^*, R^*, f^*)\\) to refer to corresponding\nitems in the target domain. In\n Example 9,\n the source domain items pertain to gravitation; the target items\npertain to electrostatic attraction.\n\nFormally, an analogy between \\(S\\) and \\(T\\) is a one-to-one\nmapping between objects, properties, relations and functions in \\(S\\)\nand those in \\(T\\). Not all of the items in \\(S\\) and \\(T\\) need to be\nplaced in correspondence. Commonly, the analogy only identifies\ncorrespondences between a select set of items. In practice, we specify\nan analogy simply by indicating the most significant similarities (and\nsometimes differences).\n\nWe can improve on this preliminary characterization of the argument\nfrom analogy by introducing the tabular representation found\nin Hesse (1966). We place corresponding objects, properties, relations\nand propositions side-by-side in a table of two columns, one for each\ndomain. For instance, Reid\u2019s argument\n (Example 2)\n can be represented as follows (using \\(\\Rightarrow\\) for the\nanalogical inference):\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nEarth \\((S)\\)\n\u00a0\nMars \\((T)\\) \n\n\\(\\leftarrow\\)vertical\\(\n\\rightarrow\\)\nKnown similarities:\n\n\norbits the sun\n\\(\\leftarrow\\)horizontal\\(\n\\rightarrow\\)\norbits the sun \n\nhas a moon\nhas moons \n\nrevolves on axis\nrevolves on axis \n\nsubject to gravity\nsubject to gravity \n\nInferred similarity:\n\n\n\u00a0\nsupports life\n\\(\\Rightarrow\\)\nmay support life  \n\n\nFigure 1.\n\n\nHesse introduced useful terminology based on this tabular\nrepresentation. The horizontal relations in an analogy are\nthe relations of similarity (and difference) in the mapping between\ndomains, while the vertical relations are those between the\nobjects, relations and properties within each domain. The\ncorrespondence (similarity) between earth\u2019s having a moon and\nMars\u2019 having moons is a horizontal relation; the causal relation\nbetween having a moon and supporting life is a vertical relation\nwithin the source domain (with the possibility of a distinct such\nrelation existing in the target as well).\n\nIn an earlier discussion of analogy, Keynes (1921) introduced some\nterminology that is also helpful.\n\n\nPositive analogy. Let \\(P\\) stand for a list\nof accepted propositions \\(P_1 , \\ldots ,P_n\\) about the source domain\n\\(S\\). Suppose that the corresponding propositions \\(P^*_1 , \\ldots\n,P^*_n\\), abbreviated as \\(P^*\\), are all accepted as holding for the\ntarget domain \\(T\\), so that \\(P\\) and \\(P^*\\) represent accepted (or\nknown) similarities. Then we refer to \\(P\\) as the positive\nanalogy.\n\nNegative analogy. Let \\(A\\) stand for a list\nof propositions \\(A_1 , \\ldots ,A_r\\) accepted as holding in \\(S\\),\nand \\(B^*\\) for a list \\(B_1^*, \\ldots ,B_s^*\\) of propositions\nholding in \\(T\\). Suppose that the analogous propositions \\(A^* =\nA_1^*, \\ldots ,A_r^*\\) fail to hold in \\(T\\), and similarly the\npropositions \\(B = B_1 , \\ldots ,B_s\\) fail to hold in \\(S\\), so that\n\\(A, {\\sim}A^*\\) and \\({\\sim}B, B^*\\) represent accepted (or known)\ndifferences. Then we refer to \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) as the negative\nanalogy.\n\nNeutral analogy. The neutral\nanalogy consists of accepted propositions about \\(S\\) for which it is\nnot known whether an analogue holds in \\(T\\).\n\n\nFinally we have:\n\n\nHypothetical analogy. The\nhypothetical analogy is simply the proposition \\(Q\\) in the\nneutral analogy that is the focus of our attention.\n\n\nThese concepts allow us to provide a characterization for an\nindividual analogical argument that is somewhat richer than the\noriginal one. \n\n\\[\\tag{4} \\text{Augmented tabular representation} \\\\\n\\begin{array}{ccc}\n \\text{Source } (S) & \\text{Target } (T) &  \\\\\n P & P^* & \\text{[positive analogy]} \\\\\n A & {\\sim}A^* & \\text{[negative analogy]} \\\\\n{\\sim}B & B^* &  \\\\\n Q & & \\\\\n\\hline\n   & Q^* & \\text{(plausibly)}\n\\end{array}\\]\n\n\nAn analogical argument may thus be summarized:\n\nIt is plausible that \\(Q^*\\) holds in the target, because of\ncertain known (or accepted) similarities with the source domain,\ndespite certain known (or accepted) differences.\n\nIn order for this characterization to be meaningful, we need to say\nsomething about the meaning of \u2018plausibly.\u2019 To ensure\nbroad applicability over analogical arguments that vary greatly in\nstrength, we interpret plausibility rather liberally as meaning\n\u2018with some degree of support\u2019. In general, judgments of\nplausibility are made after a claim has been formulated, but prior to\nrigorous testing or proof. The next sub-section provides further\ndiscussion.\n\nNote that this characterization is incomplete in a number of ways. The\nmanner in which we list similarities and differences, the nature of\nthe correspondences between domains: these things are left\nunspecified. Nor does this characterization accommodate reasoning with\nmultiple analogies (i.e., multiple source domains), which is\nubiquitous in legal reasoning and common elsewhere. To characterize\nthe argument form more fully, however, is not possible without either\ntaking a step towards a substantive theory of analogical reasoning or\nrestricting attention to certain classes of analogical arguments.\n\nArguments by analogy are extensively discussed within argumentation\ntheory. There is considerable debate about whether they constitute a\nspecies of deductive inference (Govier 1999; Waller 2001; Guarini\n2004; Kraus 2015). Argumentation theorists also make use of tools such\nas speech act theory (Bermejo-Luque 2012), argumentation schemes and\ndialogue types (Macagno et al. 2017; Walton and Hyra 2018) to\ndistinguish different types of analogical argument.\n\nArguments by analogy are also discussed in the vast literature on\nscientific models and model-based reasoning, following the lead of\nHesse (1966). Bailer-Jones (2002) draws a helpful distinction between\nanalogies and models. While \u201cmany models have their roots in an\nanalogy\u201d (2002: 113) and analogy \u201ccan act as a catalyst to\naid modeling,\u201d Bailer-Jones observes that \u201cthe aim of\nmodeling has nothing intrinsically to do with analogy.\u201d In\nbrief, models are tools for prediction and explanation, whereas\nanalogical arguments aim at establishing plausibility. An analogy is\nevaluated in terms of source-target similarity, while a model is\nevaluated on how successfully it \u201cprovides access to a\nphenomenon in that it interprets the available empirical data about\nthe phenomenon.\u201d If we broaden our perspective beyond analogical\narguments, however, the connection between models and\nanalogies is restored. Nersessian (2009), for instance, stresses the\nrole of analog models in concept-formation and other cognitive\nprocesses.\n2.3 Plausibility\n\nTo say that a hypothesis is plausible is to convey that it has\nepistemic support: we have some reason to believe it, even prior to\ntesting. An assertion of plausibility within the context of an inquiry\ntypically has pragmatic connotations as well: to say that a hypothesis\nis plausible suggests that we have some reason to investigate it\nfurther. For example, a mathematician working on a proof regards a\nconjecture as plausible if it \u201chas some chances of\nsuccess\u201d (Polya 1954 (v. 2): 148). On both points, there is\nambiguity as to whether an assertion of plausibility is categorical or\na matter of degree. These observations point to the existence of two\ndistinct conceptions of plausibility, probabilistic and\nmodal, either of which may reflect the intended conclusion of\nan analogical argument.\n\nOn the probabilistic conception, plausibility is naturally\nidentified with rational credence (rational subjective degree of\nbelief) and is typically represented as a probability. A classic\nexpression may be found in Mill\u2019s analysis of the argument from\nanalogy in A System of Logic:\n\n\nThere can be no doubt that every resemblance [not known to be\nirrelevant] affords some degree of probability, beyond what would\notherwise exist, in favour of the conclusion. (Mill 1843/1930:\n333)\n\n\nIn the terminology introduced in\n \u00a72.2,\n Mill\u2019s idea is that each element of the positive analogy boosts\nthe probability of the conclusion. Contemporary\n\u2018structure-mapping\u2019 theories\n (\u00a73.4)\n employ a restricted version: each structural similarity\nbetween two domains contributes to the overall measure of similarity,\nand hence to the strength of the analogical argument.\n\nOn the alternative modal conception, \u2018it is plausible\nthat \\(p\\)\u2019 is not a matter of degree. The meaning, roughly\nspeaking, is that there are sufficient initial grounds for taking\n\\(p\\) seriously, i.e., for further investigation (subject to\nfeasibility and interest). Informally: \\(p\\) passes an initial\nscreening procedure. There is no assertion of degree. Instead,\n\u2018It is plausible that\u2019 may be regarded as an epistemic\nmodal operator that aims to capture a notion, prima facie\nplausibility, that is somewhat stronger than ordinary epistemic\npossibility. The intent is to single out \\(p\\) from an\nundifferentiated mass of ideas that remain bare epistemic\npossibilities. To illustrate: in 1769, Priestley\u2019s argument\n (Example 9),\n if successful, would establish the prima facie plausibility\nof an inverse square law for electrostatic attraction. The set of\nepistemic possibilities\u2014hypotheses about electrostatic\nattraction compatible with knowledge of the day\u2014was much larger.\nIndividual analogical arguments in mathematics (such as\n Example 7)\n are almost invariably directed towards prima facie\nplausibility.\n\nThe modal conception figures importantly in some discussions of\nanalogical reasoning. The physicist N. R. Campbell (1957) writes:\n\n\nBut in order that a theory may be valuable it must \u2026 display an\nanalogy. The propositions of the hypothesis must be analogous to some\nknown laws\u2026. (1957: 129)\n\n\nCommenting on the role of analogy in Fourier\u2019s theory of heat\nconduction, Campbell writes:\n\n\nSome analogy is essential to it; for it is only this analogy\nwhich distinguishes the theory from the multitude of others\u2026\nwhich might also be proposed to explain the same laws. (1957: 142)\n\n\nThe interesting notion here is that of a \u201cvaluable\u201d\ntheory. We may not agree with Campbell that the existence of analogy\nis \u201cessential\u201d for a novel theory to be\n\u201cvaluable.\u201d But consider the weaker thesis that an\nacceptable analogy is sufficient to establish that a theory\nis \u201cvaluable\u201d, or (to qualify still further) that an\nacceptable analogy provides defeasible grounds for taking the theory\nseriously. (Possible defeaters might include internal inconsistency,\ninconsistency with accepted theory, or the existence of a (clearly\nsuperior) rival analogical argument.) The point is that Campbell,\nfollowing the lead of 19th century philosopher-scientists\nsuch as Herschel and Whewell, thinks that analogies can establish this\nsort of prima facie plausibility. Snyder (2006) provides a\ndetailed discussion of the latter two thinkers and their ideas about\nthe role of analogies in science.\n\nIn general, analogical arguments may be directed at establishing\neither sort of plausibility for their conclusions; they can have a\nprobabilistic use or a modal use.\n Examples 7\n through\n 9\n are best interpreted as supporting modal conclusions. In those\narguments, an analogy is used to show that a conjecture is worth\ntaking seriously. To insist on putting the conclusion in probabilistic\nterms distracts attention from the point of the argument. The\nconclusion might be modeled (by a Bayesian) as having a certain\nprobability value because it is deemed prima facie\nplausible, but not vice versa.\n Example 2,\n perhaps, might be regarded as directed primarily towards a\nprobabilistic conclusion.\n\nThere should be connections between the two conceptions. Indeed, we\nmight think that the same analogical argument can establish both\nprima facie plausibility and a degree of probability for a\nhypothesis. But it is difficult to translate between epistemic modal\nconcepts and probabilities (Cohen 1980; Douven and Williamson 2006;\nHuber 2009; Spohn 2009, 2012). We cannot simply take the probabilistic\nnotion as the primitive one. It seems wise to keep the two conceptions\nof plausibility separate.\n2.4 Analogical inference rules?\n\nSchema (4)\n is a template that represents all analogical arguments, good\nand bad. It is not an inference rule. Despite the confidence with\nwhich particular analogical arguments are advanced, nobody has ever\nformulated an acceptable rule, or set of rules, for valid analogical\ninferences. There is not even a plausible candidate. This situation is\nin marked contrast not only with deductive reasoning, but also with\nelementary forms of inductive reasoning, such as induction by\nenumeration.\n\nOf course, it is difficult to show that no successful analogical\ninference rule will ever be proposed. But consider the following\ncandidate, formulated using the concepts of schema (4) and taking us\nonly a short step beyond that basic characterization.\n\n(5) \n Suppose \\(S\\) and \\(T\\) are the source and target domains.\nSuppose \\(P_1 , \\ldots ,P_n\\) (with \\(n \\ge 1)\\) represents the\npositive analogy, \\(A_1 , \\ldots ,A_r\\) and \\({\\sim}B_1 , \\ldots\n,{\\sim}B_s\\) represent the (possibly vacuous) negative analogy, and\n\\(Q\\) represents the hypothetical analogy. In the absence of reasons\nfor thinking otherwise, infer that \\(Q^*\\) holds in the target domain\nwith degree of support \\(p \\gt 0\\), where \\(p\\) is an increasing\nfunction of \\(n\\) and a decreasing function of \\(r\\) and \\(s\\). \n\n\nRule (5) is modeled on the\n straight rule for enumerative induction\n and inspired by Mill\u2019s view of analogical inference, as\ndescribed in\n \u00a72.3.\n We use the generic phrase \u2018degree of support\u2019 in place of\nprobability, since other factors besides the analogical argument may\ninfluence our probability assignment for \\(Q^*\\).\n\nIt is pretty clear that (5) is a non-starter. The main problem is that\nthe rule justifies too much. The only substantive requirement\nintroduced by (5) is that there be a nonempty positive analogy.\nPlainly, there are analogical arguments that satisfy this condition\nbut establish no prima facie plausibility and no measure of\nsupport for their conclusions.\n\nHere is a simple illustration. Achinstein (1964: 328) observes that\nthere is a formal analogy between swans and line segments if we take\nthe relation \u2018has the same color as\u2019 to correspond to\n\u2018is congruent with\u2019. Both relations are reflexive,\nsymmetric, and transitive. Yet it would be absurd to find positive\nsupport from this analogy for the idea that we are likely to find\ncongruent lines clustered in groups of two or more, just because swans\nof the same color are commonly found in groups. The positive analogy\nis antecedently known to be irrelevant to the hypothetical analogy. In\nsuch a case, the analogical inference should be utterly rejected. Yet\nrule (5) would wrongly assign non-zero degree of support.\n\nTo generalize the difficulty: not every similarity increases the\nprobability of the conclusion and not every difference decreases it.\nSome similarities and differences are known to be (or accepted as\nbeing) utterly irrelevant and should have no influence whatsoever on\nour probability judgments. To be viable, rule (5) would need to be\nsupplemented with considerations of relevance, which depend\nupon the subject matter, historical context and logical details\nparticular to each analogical argument. To search for a simple rule of\nanalogical inference thus appears futile.\n\nCarnap and his followers (Carnap 1980; Kuipers 1988; Niiniluoto 1988;\nMaher 2000; Romeijn 2006) have formulated principles of analogy for\ninductive logic, using Carnapian \\(\\lambda \\gamma\\) rules. Generally,\nthis body of work relates to \u201canalogy by similarity\u201d,\nrather than the type of analogical reasoning discussed here. Romeijn\n(2006) maintains that there is a relation between Carnap\u2019s\nconcept of analogy and analogical prediction. His approach is a hybrid\nof Carnap-style inductive rules and a Bayesian model. Such an approach\nwould need to be generalized to handle the kinds of arguments\ndescribed in\n \u00a72.1.\n It remains unclear that the Carnapian approach can provide a general\nrule for analogical inference.\n\nNorton (2010, and 2018\u2014see Other Internet Resources) has argued\nthat the project of formalizing inductive reasoning in terms of one or\nmore simple formal schemata is doomed. His criticisms seem especially\napt when applied to analogical reasoning. He writes:\n\n\nIf analogical reasoning is required to conform only to a simple formal\nschema, the restriction is too permissive. Inferences are authorized\nthat clearly should not pass muster\u2026 The natural response has\nbeen to develop more elaborate formal templates\u2026 The familiar\ndifficulty is that these embellished schema never seem to be quite\nembellished enough; there always seems to be some part of the analysis\nthat must be handled intuitively without guidance from strict formal\nrules. (2018: 1)\n\n\nNorton takes the point one step further, in keeping with his\n\u201cmaterial theory\u201d of inductive inference. He argues that\nthere is no universal logical principle that \u201cpowers\u201d\nanalogical inference \u201cby asserting that things that share some\nproperties must share others.\u201d Rather, each analogical inference\nis warranted by some local constellation of facts about the target\nsystem that he terms \u201cthe fact of analogy\u201d. These local\nfacts are to be determined and investigated on a case by case\nbasis.\n\nTo embrace a purely formal approach to analogy and to abjure\nformalization entirely are two extremes in a spectrum of strategies.\nThere are intermediate positions. Most recent analyses (both\nphilosophical and computational) have been directed towards\nelucidating criteria and procedures, rather than formal rules, for\nreasoning by analogy. So long as these are not intended to provide a\nuniversal \u2018logic\u2019 of analogy, there is room for such\ncriteria even if one accepts Norton\u2019s basic point. The next\nsection discusses some of these criteria and procedures.\n3. Criteria for evaluating analogical arguments\n3.1 Commonsense guidelines\n\nLogicians and philosophers of science have identified\n\u2018textbook-style\u2019 general guidelines for evaluating\nanalogical arguments (Mill 1843/1930; Keynes 1921; Robinson 1930;\nStebbing 1933; Copi and Cohen 2005; Moore and Parker 1998; Woods,\nIrvine, and Walton 2004). Here are some of the most important\nones:\n\n(G1) \n The more similarities (between two domains), the stronger the\nanalogy. \n(G2) \n The more differences, the weaker the analogy. \n(G3) \n The greater the extent of our ignorance about the two domains,\nthe weaker the analogy. \n(G4) \n The weaker the conclusion, the more plausible the analogy. \n(G5) \n Analogies involving causal relations are more plausible than\nthose not involving causal relations. \n(G6) \n Structural analogies are stronger than those based on superficial\nsimilarities. \n(G7) \n The relevance of the similarities and differences to the\nconclusion (i.e., to the hypothetical analogy) must be taken into\naccount. \n(G8) \n Multiple analogies supporting the same conclusion make the\nargument stronger. \n\n\nThese principles can be helpful, but are frequently too vague to\nprovide much insight. How do we count similarities and differences in\napplying (G1) and (G2)? Why are the structural and causal analogies\nmentioned in (G5) and (G6) especially important, and which structural\nand causal features merit attention? More generally, in connection\nwith the all-important (G7): how do we determine which similarities\nand differences are relevant to the conclusion? Furthermore, what are\nwe to say about similarities and differences that have been omitted\nfrom an analogical argument but might still be relevant?\n\nAn additional problem is that the criteria can pull in different\ndirections. To illustrate, consider Reid\u2019s argument for life on\nother planets\n (Example 2).\n Stebbing (1933) finds Reid\u2019s argument \u201csuggestive\u201d\nand \u201cnot unplausible\u201d because the conclusion is weak (G4),\nwhile Mill (1843/1930) appears to reject the argument on account of\nour vast ignorance of properties that might be relevant (G3).\n\nThere is a further problem that relates to the distinction just made\n(in\n \u00a72.3)\n between two kinds of plausibility. Each of the above criteria apart\nfrom (G7) is expressed in terms of the strength of the argument, i.e.,\nthe degree of support for the conclusion. The criteria thus appear to\npresuppose the probabilistic interpretation of plausibility.\nThe problem is that a great many analogical arguments aim to establish\nprima facie plausibility rather than any degree of\nprobability. Most of the guidelines are not directly applicable to\nsuch arguments.\n3.2 Aristotle\u2019s theory\n\nAristotle sets the stage for all later theories of analogical\nreasoning. In his theoretical reflections on analogy and in his most\njudicious examples, we find a sober account that lays the foundation\nboth for the commonsense guidelines noted above and for more\nsophisticated analyses.\n\nAlthough Aristotle employs the term analogy (analogia) and\ndiscusses\n analogical predication,\n he never talks about analogical reasoning or analogical arguments\nper se. He does, however, identify two argument forms, the\nargument from example (paradeigma) and the\nargument from likeness (homoiotes), both closely\nrelated to what would we now recognize as an analogical argument.\n\nThe argument from example (paradeigma) is described\nin the Rhetoric and the Prior Analytics:\n\n\nEnthymemes based upon example are those which proceed from one or more\nsimilar cases, arrive at a general proposition, and then argue\ndeductively to a particular inference. (Rhetoric 1402b15)\n\nLet \\(A\\) be evil, \\(B\\) making war against neighbours, \\(C\\)\nAthenians against Thebans, \\(D\\) Thebans against Phocians. If then we\nwish to prove that to fight with the Thebans is an evil, we must\nassume that to fight against neighbours is an evil. Conviction of this\nis obtained from similar cases, e.g., that the war against the\nPhocians was an evil to the Thebans. Since then to fight against\nneighbours is an evil, and to fight against the Thebans is to fight\nagainst neighbours, it is clear that to fight against the Thebans is\nan evil. (Pr. An. 69a1)\n\n\nAristotle notes two differences between this argument form and\ninduction (69a15ff.): it \u201cdoes not draw its proof from all the\nparticular cases\u201d (i.e., it is not a \u201ccomplete\u201d\ninduction), and it requires an additional (deductively valid)\nsyllogism as the final step. The argument from example thus amounts to\nsingle-case induction followed by deductive inference. It has the\nfollowing structure (using \\(\\supset\\) for the conditional):\n\n\n\nFigure 2.\n\n\nIn the terminology of\n \u00a72.2,\n \\(P\\) is the positive analogy and \\(Q\\) is the hypothetical analogy.\nIn Aristotle\u2019s example, \\(S\\) (the source) is war between\nPhocians and Thebans, \\(T\\) (the target) is war between Athenians and\nThebans, \\(P\\) is war between neighbours, and \\(Q\\) is evil. The first\ninference (dashed arrow) is inductive; the second and third (solid\narrows) are deductively valid.\n\nThe paradeigma has an interesting feature: it is amenable to\nan alternative analysis as a purely deductive argument form.\nLet us concentrate on Aristotle\u2019s assertion, \u201cwe must\nassume that to fight against neighbours is an evil,\u201d represented\nas \\(\\forall x(P(x) \\supset Q(x))\\). Instead of regarding this\nintermediate step as something reached by induction from a single\ncase, we might instead regard it as a hidden presupposition. This\ntransforms the paradeigma into a syllogistic argument with a\nmissing or enthymematic premise, and our attention shifts to\npossible means for establishing that premise (with single-case\ninduction as one such means). Construed in this way, Aristotle\u2019s\nparadeigma argument foreshadows deductive analyses of\nanalogical reasoning (see\n \u00a74.1).\n\nThe argument from likeness (homoiotes) seems to be\ncloser than the paradeigma to our contemporary understanding\nof analogical arguments. This argument form receives considerable\nattention in Topics I, 17 and 18 and again in VIII, 1. The\nmost important passage is the following.\n\n\nTry to secure admissions by means of likeness; for such admissions are\nplausible, and the universal involved is less patent; e.g. that as\nknowledge and ignorance of contraries is the same, so too perception\nof contraries is the same; or vice versa, that since the perception is\nthe same, so is the knowledge also. This argument resembles induction,\nbut is not the same thing; for in induction it is the universal whose\nadmission is secured from the particulars, whereas in arguments from\nlikeness, what is secured is not the universal under which all the\nlike cases fall. (Topics 156b10\u201317)\n\n\nThis passage occurs in a work that offers advice for framing\ndialectical arguments when confronting a somewhat skeptical\ninterlocutor. In such situations, it is best not to make one\u2019s\nargument depend upon securing agreement about any universal\nproposition. The argument from likeness is thus clearly distinct from\nthe paradeigma, where the universal proposition plays an\nessential role as an intermediate step in the argument. The argument\nfrom likeness, though logically less straightforward than the\nparadeigma, is exactly the sort of analogical reasoning we\nwant when we are unsure about underlying generalizations.\n\nIn Topics I 17, Aristotle states that any shared attribute\ncontributes some degree of likeness. It is natural to ask when the\ndegree of likeness between two things is sufficiently great to warrant\ninferring a further likeness. In other words, when does the argument\nfrom likeness succeed? Aristotle does not answer explicitly, but a\nclue is provided by the way he justifies particular arguments from\nlikeness. As Lloyd (1966) has observed, Aristotle typically justifies\nsuch arguments by articulating a (sometimes vague) causal principle\nwhich governs the two phenomena being compared. For example, Aristotle\nexplains the saltiness of the sea, by analogy with the saltiness of\nsweat, as a kind of residual earthy stuff exuded in natural processes\nsuch as heating. The common principle is this:\n\n\nEverything that grows and is naturally generated always leaves a\nresidue, like that of things burnt, consisting in this sort of earth.\n(Mete 358a17)\n\n\nFrom this method of justification, we might conjecture that Aristotle\nbelieves that the important similarities are those that enter into\nsuch general causal principles.\n\nSummarizing, Aristotle\u2019s theory provides us with four important\nand influential criteria for the evaluation of analogical\narguments:\n\nThe strength of an analogy depends upon the number of\nsimilarities.\nSimilarity reduces to identical properties and\nrelations.\nGood analogies derive from underlying common causes or general\nlaws.\nA good analogical argument need not pre-suppose acquaintance\nwith the underlying universal (generalization).\n\n\nThese four principles form the core of a common-sense model\nfor evaluating analogical arguments (which is not to say that they are\ncorrect; indeed, the first three will shortly be called into\nquestion). The first, as we have seen, appears regularly in textbook\ndiscussions of analogy. The second is largely taken for granted, with\nimportant exceptions in computational models of analogy\n (\u00a73.4).\n Versions of the third are found in most sophisticated theories. The\nfinal point, which distinguishes the argument from likeness and the\nargument from example, is endorsed in many discussions of analogy\n(e.g., Quine and Ullian 1970).\n\nA slight generalization of Aristotle\u2019s first principle helps to\nprepare the way for discussion of later developments. As that\nprinciple suggests, Aristotle, in common with just about everyone else\nwho has written about analogical reasoning, organizes his analysis of\nthe argument form around overall similarity. In the terminology of\n section 2.2,\nhorizontal relationships drive the reasoning: the\ngreater the overall similarity of the two domains, the stronger the\nanalogical argument. Hume makes the same point, though stated\nnegatively, in his Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion:\n\n\nWherever you depart, in the least, from the similarity of the cases,\nyou diminish proportionably the evidence; and may at last bring it to\na very weak analogy, which is confessedly liable to error and\nuncertainty. (1779/1947: 144)\n\n\nMost theories of analogy agree with Aristotle and Hume on this general\npoint. Disagreement relates to the appropriate way of measuring\noverall similarity. Some theories assign greatest weight to\nmaterial analogy, which refers to shared, and typically\nobservable, features. Others give prominence to formal\nanalogy, emphasizing high-level structural correspondence. The\nnext two sub-sections discuss representative accounts that illustrate\nthese two approaches.\n3.3 Material criteria: Hesse\u2019s theory\n\nHesse (1966) offers a sharpened version of Aristotle\u2019s theory,\nspecifically focused on analogical arguments in the sciences. She\nformulates three requirements that an analogical argument must satisfy\nin order to be acceptable:\n\nRequirement of material analogy. The horizontal relations\nmust include similarities between observable properties.\nCausal condition. The vertical relations must be causal\nrelations \u201cin some acceptable scientific sense\u201d (1966:\n87).\nNo-essential-difference condition. The essential\nproperties and causal relations of the source domain must not have\nbeen shown to be part of the negative analogy.\n\n3.3.1 Requirement of material analogy\n\nFor Hesse, an acceptable analogical argument must include\n\u201cobservable similarities\u201d between domains, which she\nrefers to as material analogy. Material analogy is contrasted\nwith formal analogy. Two domains are formally analogous if\nboth are \u201cinterpretations of the same formal theory\u201d\n(1966: 68). Nomic isomorphism (Hempel 1965) is a special case\nin which the physical laws governing two systems have identical\nmathematical form. Heat and fluid flow exhibit nomic isomorphism. A\nsecond example is the analogy between the flow of electric current in\na wire and fluid in a pipe. Ohm\u2019s law \n\n\\[\\tag{6}\n\\Delta v = iR\n\\]\n\n\nstates that voltage difference along a wire equals current times a\nconstant resistance. This has the same mathematical form as\nPoiseuille\u2019s law (for ideal fluids): \n\n\\[\\tag{7}\n\\Delta p = \\dot{V}k\n\\]\n\n\nwhich states that the pressure difference along a pipe equals the\nvolumetric flow rate times a constant. Both of these systems can be\nrepresented by a common equation. While formal analogy is linked to\ncommon mathematical structure, it should not be limited to nomic\nisomorphism (Bartha 2010: 209). The idea of formal analogy generalizes\nto cases where there is a common mathematical structure between\nmodels for two systems. Bartha offers an even more liberal\ndefinition (2010: 195): \u201cTwo features are formally similar if\nthey occupy corresponding positions in formally analogous theories.\nFor example, pitch in the theory of sound corresponds to color in the\ntheory of light.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, material analogy consists of what Hesse calls\n\u201cobservable\u201d or \u201cpre-theoretic\u201d similarities.\nThese are horizontal relationships of similarity between properties of\nobjects in the source and the target. Similarities between echoes\n(sound) and reflection (light), for instance, were recognized long\nbefore we had any detailed theories about these phenomena. Hesse\n(1966, 1988) regards such similarities as metaphorical relationships\nbetween the two domains and labels them \u201cpre-theoretic\u201d\nbecause they draw on personal and cultural experience. We have both\nmaterial and formal analogies between sound and light, and it is\nsignificant for Hesse that the former are independent of the\nlatter.\n\nThere are good reasons not to accept Hesse\u2019s requirement of\nmaterial analogy, construed in this narrow way. First, it is apparent\nthat formal analogies are the starting point in many\nimportant inferences. That is certainly the case in mathematics, a\nfield in which material analogy, in Hesse\u2019s sense, plays no role\nat all. Analogical arguments based on formal analogy have also been\nextremely influential in physics (Steiner 1989, 1998).\n\nIn Norton\u2019s broad sense, however, \u2018material analogy\u2019\nsimply refers to similarities rooted in factual knowledge of the\nsource and target domains. With reference to this broader meaning,\nHesse proposes two additional material criteria.\n3.3.2 Causal condition\n\nHesse requires that the hypothetical analogy, the feature transferred\nto the target domain, be causally related to the positive\nanalogy. In her words, the essential requirement for a good argument\nfrom analogy is \u201ca tendency to co-occurrence\u201d, i.e., a\ncausal relationship. She states the requirement as follows:\n\n\nThe vertical relations in the model [source] are causal relations in\nsome acceptable scientific sense, where there are no compelling a\npriori reasons for denying that causal relations of the same kind may\nhold between terms of the explanandum [target]. (1966: 87)\n\n\nThe causal condition rules out analogical arguments where there is no\ncausal knowledge of the source domain. It derives support from the\nobservation that many analogies do appear to involve a transfer of\ncausal knowledge.\n\nThe causal condition is on the right track, but is arguably too\nrestrictive. For example, it rules out analogical arguments in\nmathematics. Even if we limit attention to the empirical sciences,\npersuasive analogical arguments may be founded upon strong statistical\ncorrelation in the absence of any known causal connection.\nConsider\n (Example 11)\n Benjamin Franklin\u2019s prediction, in 1749, that pointed metal\nrods would attract lightning, by analogy with the way they attracted\nthe \u201celectrical fluid\u201d in the laboratory:\n\n\nElectrical fluid agrees with lightning in these particulars: 1. Giving\nlight. 2. Colour of the light. 3. Crooked direction. 4. Swift motion.\n5. Being conducted by metals. 6. Crack or noise in exploding. 7.\nSubsisting in water or ice. 8. Rending bodies it passes through. 9.\nDestroying animals. 10. Melting metals. 11. Firing inflammable\nsubstances. 12. Sulphureous smell.\u2014The electrical fluid is\nattracted by points.\u2014We do not know whether this property is in\nlightning.\u2014But since they agree in all the particulars wherein\nwe can already compare them, is it not probable they agree likewise in\nthis? Let the experiment be made. (Benjamin Franklin\u2019s\nExperiments, 334)\n\n\nFranklin\u2019s hypothesis was based on a long list of properties\ncommon to the target (lightning) and source (electrical fluid in the\nlaboratory). There was no known causal connection between the twelve\n\u201cparticulars\u201d and the thirteenth property, but there was a\nstrong correlation. Analogical arguments may be plausible even where\nthere are no known causal relations.\n3.3.3 No-essential-difference condition\n\nHesse\u2019s final requirement is that the \u201cessential\nproperties and causal relations of the [source] have not been shown to\nbe part of the negative analogy\u201d (1966: 91). Hesse does not\nprovide a definition of \u201cessential,\u201d but suggests that a\nproperty or relation is essential if it is \u201ccausally closely\nrelated to the known positive analogy.\u201d For instance, an analogy\nwith fluid flow was extremely influential in developing the theory of\nheat conduction. Once it was discovered that heat was not conserved,\nhowever, the analogy became unacceptable (according to Hesse) because\nconservation was so central to the theory of fluid flow.\n\nThis requirement, though once again on the right track, seems too\nrestrictive. It can lead to the rejection of a good analogical\nargument. Consider the analogy between a two-dimensional rectangle and\na three-dimensional box\n (Example 7).\n Broadening Hesse\u2019s notion, it seems that there are many\n\u2018essential\u2019 differences between rectangles and boxes. This\ndoes not mean that we should reject every analogy between rectangles\nand boxes out of hand. The problem derives from the fact that\nHesse\u2019s condition is applied to the analogy relation\nindependently of the use to which that relation is put. What counts as\nessential should vary with the analogical argument. Absent an\ninferential context, it is impossible to evaluate the importance or\n\u2018essentiality\u2019 of similarities and differences.\n\nDespite these weaknesses, Hesse\u2019s \u2018material\u2019\ncriteria constitute a significant advance in our understanding of\nanalogical reasoning. The causal condition and the\nno-essential-difference condition incorporate local factors, as urged\nby Norton, into the assessment of analogical arguments. These\nconditions, singly or taken together, imply that an analogical\nargument can fail to generate any support for its conclusion, even\nwhen there is a non-empty positive analogy. Hesse offers no theory\nabout the \u2018degree\u2019 of analogical support. That makes her\naccount one of the few that is oriented towards the modal, rather than\nprobabilistic, use of analogical arguments\n (\u00a72.3).\n3.4 Formal criteria: the structure-mapping theory\n\nMany people take the concept of\n model-theoretic isomorphism\n to set the standard for thinking about similarity and its role in\nanalogical reasoning. They propose formal criteria for\nevaluating analogies, based on overall structural or syntactical\nsimilarity. Let us refer to theories oriented around such criteria as\nstructuralist.\n\nA number of leading computational models of analogy are structuralist.\nThey are implemented in computer programs that begin with (or\nsometimes build) representations of the source and target domains, and\nthen construct possible analogy mappings. Analogical inferences emerge\nas a consequence of identifying the \u2018best mapping.\u2019 In\nterms of criteria for analogical reasoning, there are two main ideas.\nFirst, the goodness of an analogical argument is based on the\ngoodness of the associated analogy mapping. Second, the\ngoodness of the analogy mapping is given by a metric that indicates\nhow closely it approximates isomorphism.\n\nThe most influential structuralist theory has been Gentner\u2019s\nstructure-mapping theory, implemented in a program called the\nstructure-mapping engine (SME). In its original form (Gentner\n1983), the theory assesses analogies on purely structural grounds.\nGentner asserts:\n\n\nAnalogies are about relations, rather than simple features. No matter\nwhat kind of knowledge (causal models, plans, stories, etc.), it is\nthe structural properties (i.e., the interrelationships between the\nfacts) that determine the content of an analogy. (Falkenhainer,\nForbus, and Gentner 1989/90: 3)\n\n\nIn order to clarify this thesis, Gentner introduces a distinction\nbetween properties, or monadic predicates, and\nrelations, which have multiple arguments. She further\ndistinguishes among different orders of relations and\nfunctions, defined inductively (in terms of the order of the relata or\narguments). The best mapping is determined by systematicity:\nthe extent to which it places higher-order relations, and items that\nare nested in higher-order relations, in correspondence.\nGentner\u2019s Systematicity Principle states:\n\n\nA predicate that belongs to a mappable system of mutually\ninterconnecting relationships is more likely to be imported into the\ntarget than is an isolated predicate. (1983: 163)\n\n\nA systematic analogy (one that places high-order relations and their\ncomponents in correspondence) is better than a less systematic\nanalogy. Hence, an analogical inference has a degree of plausibility\nthat increases monotonically with the degree of systematicity of the\nassociated analogy mapping. Gentner\u2019s fundamental criterion for\nevaluating candidate analogies (and analogical inferences) thus\ndepends solely upon the syntax of the given representations and not at\nall upon their content.\n\nLater versions of the structure-mapping theory incorporate refinements\n(Forbus, Ferguson, and Gentner 1994; Forbus 2001; Forbus et al. 2007;\nForbus et al. 2008; Forbus et al 2017). For example, the earliest\nversion of the theory is vulnerable to worries about hand-coded\nrepresentations of source and target domains. Gentner and her\ncolleagues have attempted to solve this problem in later work that\ngenerates LISP representations from natural language text (see Turney\n2008 for a different approach).\n\nThe most important challenges for the structure-mapping approach\nrelate to the Systematicity Principle itself. Does the value\nof an analogy derive entirely, or even chiefly, from systematicity?\nThere appear to be two main difficulties with this view. First: it is\nnot always appropriate to give priority to systematic, high-level\nrelational matches. Material criteria, and notably what Gentner refers\nto as \u201csuperficial feature matches,\u201d can be extremely\nimportant in some types of analogical reasoning, such as ethnographic\nanalogies which are based, to a considerable degree, on surface\nresemblances between artifacts. Second and more significantly:\nsystematicity seems to be at best a fallible marker for good\nanalogies rather than the essence of good analogical reasoning.\n\nGreater systematicity is neither necessary nor sufficient for a more\nplausible analogical inference. It is obvious that increased\nsystematicity is not sufficient for increased plausibility.\nAn implausible analogy can be represented in a form that exhibits a\nhigh degree of structural parallelism. High-order relations can come\ncheap, as we saw with Achinstein\u2019s \u201cswan\u201d example\n (\u00a72.4).\n\nMore pointedly, increased systematicity is not necessary for\ngreater plausibility. Indeed, in causal analogies, it may even weaken\nthe inference. That is because systematicity takes no account\nof the type of causal relevance, positive or negative. (McKay\n1993) notes that microbes have been found in frozen lakes in\nAntarctica; by analogy, simple life forms might exist on Mars.\nFreezing temperatures are preventive or counteracting causes;\nthey are negatively relevant to the existence of life. The\nclimate of Mars was probably more favorable to life 3.5\nbillion years ago than it is today, because temperatures were warmer.\nYet the analogy between Antarctica and present-day Mars is more\nsystematic than the analogy between Antarctica and ancient Mars.\nAccording to the Systematicity Principle, the analogy with\nAntarctica provides stronger support for life on Mars today than it\ndoes for life on ancient Mars.\n\nThe point of this example is that increased systematicity does not\nalways increase plausibility, and reduced systematicity does not\nalways decrease it (see Lee and Holyoak 2008). The more general point\nis that systematicity can be misleading, unless we take into account\nthe nature of the relationships between various factors and\nthe hypothetical analogy. Systematicity does not magically produce or\nexplain the plausibility of an analogical argument. When we reason by\nanalogy, we must determine which features of both domains are relevant\nand how they relate to the analogical conclusion. There is no\nshort-cut via syntax.\n\nSchlimm (2008) offers an entirely different critique of the\nstructure-mapping theory from the perspective of analogical reasoning\nin mathematics\u2014a domain where one might expect a formal approach\nsuch as structure mapping to perform well. Schlimm introduces\na simple distinction: a domain is object-rich if the number\nof objects is greater than the number of relations (and properties),\nand relation-rich otherwise. Proponents of the\nstructure-mapping theory typically focus on relation-rich examples\n(such as the analogy between the solar system and the atom). By\ncontrast, analogies in mathematics typically involve domains with an\nenormous number of objects (like the real numbers), but relatively few\nrelations and functions (addition, multiplication, less-than).\n\nSchlimm provides an example of an analogical reasoning problem in\ngroup theory that involves a single relation in each domain. In this\ncase, attaining maximal systematicity is trivial. The difficulty is\nthat, compatible with maximal systematicity, there are different ways\nin which the objects might be placed in correspondence. The\nstructure-mapping theory appears to yield the wrong inference. We\nmight put the general point as follows: in object-rich domains,\nsystematicity ceases to be a reliable guide to plausible analogical\ninference.\n3.5 Other theories\n3.5.1 Connectionist models\n\nDuring the past thirty-five years, cognitive scientists have conducted\nextensive research on analogy. Gentner\u2019s SME is just one of many\ncomputational theories, implemented in programs that construct and use\nanalogies. Three helpful anthologies that span this period are Helman\n1988; Gentner, Holyoak, and Kokinov 2001; and Kokinov, Holyoak, and\nGentner 2009.\n\nOne predominant objective of this research has been to model the\ncognitive processes involved in using analogies. Early models tended\nto be oriented towards \u201cunderstanding the basic constraints that\ngovern human analogical thinking\u201d (Hummel and Holyoak 1997:\n458). Recent connectionist models have been directed towards\nuncovering the psychological mechanisms that come into play when we\nuse analogies: retrieval of a relevant source domain,\nanalogical mapping across domains, and transfer of\ninformation and learning of new categories or schemas.\n\nIn some cases, such as the structure-mapping theory (\u00a73.4), this\nresearch overlaps directly with the normative questions that are the\nfocus of this entry; indeed, Gentner\u2019s Systematicity\nPrinciple may be interpreted normatively. In other cases, we\nmight view the projects as displacing those traditional\nnormative questions with up-to-date, computational forms of\n naturalized epistemology.\n Two approaches are singled out here because both raise important\nchallenges to the very idea of finding sharp answers to those\nquestions, and both suggest that connectionist models offer a more\nfruitful approach to understanding analogical reasoning.\n\nThe first is the constraint-satisfaction\nmodel (also known as the multiconstraint\ntheory), developed by Holyoak and Thagard (1989, 1995).\nLike Gentner, Holyoak and Thagard regard the heart of analogical\nreasoning as analogy mapping, and they stress the importance\nof systematicity, which they refer to as a structural\nconstraint. Unlike Gentner, they acknowledge two additional types of\nconstraints. Pragmatic constraints take into account the\ngoals and purposes of the agent, recognizing that \u201cthe purpose\nwill guide selection\u201d of relevant similarities.\nSemantic constraints represent estimates of the degree to\nwhich people regard source and target items as being alike, rather\nlike Hesse\u2019s \u201cpre-theoretic\u201d similarities.\n\nThe novelty of the multiconstraint theory is that these\nstructural, semantic and pragmatic\nconstraints are implemented not as rigid rules, but rather as\n\u2018pressures\u2019 supporting or inhibiting potential pairwise\ncorrespondences. The theory is implemented in a connectionist program\ncalled ACME (Analogical Constraint Mapping Engine),\nwhich assigns an initial activation value to each possible pairing\nbetween elements in the source and target domains (based on semantic\nand pragmatic constraints), and then runs through cycles that update\nthe activation values based on overall coherence (structural\nconstraints). The best global analogy mapping emerges under the\npressure of these constraints. Subsequent connectionist models, such\nas Hummel and Holyoak\u2019s LISA program (1997, 2003), have made\nsignificant advances and hold promise for offering a more complete\ntheory of analogical reasoning.\n\nThe second example is Hofstadter and Mitchell\u2019s\nCopycat program (Hofstadter 1995; Mitchell\n1993). The program is \u201cdesigned to discover insightful\nanalogies, and to do so in a psychologically realistic way\u201d\n(Hofstadter 1995: 205). Copycat operates in the domain of\nletter-strings. The program handles the following type of problem:\n\nSuppose the letter-string abc were changed to abd;\nhow would you change the letter-string ijk in \u201cthe same\nway\u201d?\n\nMost people would answer ijl, since it is natural to think\nthat abc was changed to abd by the\n\u201ctransformation rule\u201d: replace the rightmost letter with\nits successor. Alternative answers are possible, but do not agree with\nmost people\u2019s sense of what counts as the natural analogy.\n\nHofstadter and Mitchell believe that analogy-making is in large part\nabout the perception of novel patterns, and that such\nperception requires concepts with \u201cfluid\u201d boundaries.\nGenuine analogy-making involves \u201cslippage\u201d of concepts.\nThe Copycat program combines a set of core concepts pertaining to\nletter-sequences (successor, leftmost and so forth)\nwith probabilistic \u201chalos\u201d that link distinct concepts\ndynamically. Orderly structures emerge out of random low-level\nprocesses and the program produces plausible solutions. Copycat thus\nshows that analogy-making can be modeled as a process akin to\nperception, even if the program employs mechanisms distinct from those\nin human perception.\n\nThe multiconstraint theory and Copycat share the idea that analogical\ncognition involves cognitive processes that operate below the level of\nabstract reasoning. Both computational models\u2014to the extent that\nthey are capable of performing successful analogical\nreasoning\u2014challenge the idea that a successful model of\nanalogical reasoning must take the form of a set of quasi-logical\ncriteria. Efforts to develop a quasi-logical theory of\nanalogical reasoning, it might be argued, have failed. In place of\nfaulty inference schemes such as those described earlier\n (\u00a72.2,\n \u00a72.4), computational models substitute procedures\nthat can be judged on their performance rather than on traditional\nphilosophical standards.\n\nIn response to this argument, we should recognize the value of the\nconnectionist models while acknowledging that we still need a theory\nthat offers normative principles for evaluating analogical arguments.\nIn the first place, even if the construction and recognition of\nanalogies are largely a matter of perception, this does not eliminate\nthe need for subsequent critical evaluation of analogical inferences.\nSecond and more importantly, we need to look not just at the\nconstruction of analogy mappings but at the ways in which individual\nanalogical arguments are debated in fields such as mathematics,\nphysics, philosophy and the law. These high-level debates require\nreasoning that bears little resemblance to the computational processes\nof ACME or Copycat. (Ashley\u2019s HYPO (Ashley 1990) is one example\nof a non-connectionist program that focuses on this aspect of\nanalogical reasoning.) There is, accordingly, room for both\ncomputational and traditional philosophical models of analogical\nreasoning.\n3.5.2 Articulation model\n\nMost prominent theories of analogy, philosophical and computational,\nare based on overall similarity between source and target\ndomains\u2014defined in terms of some favoured subset of\nHesse\u2019s horizontal relations (see\n \u00a72.2).\n Aristotle and Mill, whose approach is echoed in textbook discussions,\nsuggest counting similarities. Hesse\u2019s theory\n (\u00a73.3)\n favours \u201cpre-theoretic\u201d correspondences. The\nstructure-mapping theory and its successors\n (\u00a73.4)\n look to systematicity, i.e., to correspondences involving complex,\nhigh-level networks of relations. In each of these approaches, the\nproblem is twofold: overall similarity is not a reliable guide to\nplausibility, and it fails to explain the plausibility of any\nanalogical argument.\n\nBartha\u2019s articulation model (2010)\nproposes a different approach, beginning not with horizontal\nrelations, but rather with a classification of analogical arguments on\nthe basis of the vertical relations within each domain. The\nfundamental idea is that a good analogical argument must satisfy two\nconditions:\n\nPrior Association. There must be a clear connection, in the\nsource domain, between the known similarities (the positive analogy)\nand the further similarity that is projected to hold in the target\ndomain (the hypothetical analogy). This relationship determines which\nfeatures of the source are critical to the analogical\ninference.\n\nPotential for Generalization. There must be reason to think\nthat the same kind of connection could obtain in the target domain.\nMore pointedly: there must be no critical disanalogy between\nthe domains.\n\nThe first order of business is to make the prior association explicit.\nThe standards of explicitness vary depending on the nature of this\nassociation (causal relation, mathematical proof, functional\nrelationship, and so forth). The two general principles are fleshed\nout via a set of subordinate models that allow us to identify critical\nfeatures and hence critical disanalogies.\n\nTo see how this works, consider\n Example 7\n (Rectangles and boxes). In this analogical argument, the source\ndomain is two-dimensional geometry: we know that of all rectangles\nwith a fixed perimeter, the square has maximum area. The target domain\nis three-dimensional geometry: by analogy, we conjecture that of all\nboxes with a fixed surface area, the cube has maximum volume. This\nargument should be evaluated not by counting similarities,\nlooking to pre-theoretic resemblances between rectangles and boxes, or\nconstructing connectionist representations of the domains and\ncomputing a systematicity score for possible mappings. Instead, we\nshould begin with a precise articulation of the prior association in\nthe source domain, which amounts to a specific proof for the result\nabout rectangles. We should then identify, relative to that proof, the\ncritical features of the source domain: namely, the concepts and\nassumptions used in the proof. Finally, we should assess the potential\nfor generalization: whether, in the three-dimensional setting, those\ncritical features are known to lack analogues in the target domain.\nThe articulation model is meant to reflect the conversations that can\nand do take place between an advocate and a critic\nof an analogical argument.\n3.6 Practice-based approaches Studies of analogical reasoning based on scientific\npractice provide valuable perspectives on criteria for evaluating\nanalogical arguments.\n\n3.6.1 Norton\u2019s material theory of analogy\n\nAs noted in\n \u00a72.4,\n Norton rejects analogical inference rules. But even if we agree with\nNorton on this point, we might still be interested in having an\naccount that gives us guidelines for evaluating analogical arguments.\nHow does Norton\u2019s approach fare on this score?\n\nAccording to Norton, each analogical argument is warranted by local\nfacts that must be investigated and justified empirically. First,\nthere is \u201cthe fact of the analogy\u201d: in practice, a\nlow-level uniformity that embraces both the source and target systems.\nSecond, there are additional factual properties of the target system\nwhich, when taken together with the uniformity, warrant the analogical\ninference. Consider Galileo\u2019s famous inference\n (Example 12)\n that there are mountains on the moon (Galileo 1610). Through his\nnewly invented telescope, Galileo observed points of light on the moon\nahead of the advancing edge of sunlight. Noting that the same thing\nhappens on earth when sunlight strikes the mountains, he concluded\nthat there must be mountains on the moon and even provided a\nreasonable estimate of their height. In this example, Norton tells us,\nthe the fact of the analogy is that shadows and other optical\nphenomena are generated in the same way on the earth and on the moon;\nthe additional fact about the target is the existence of points of\nlight ahead of the advancing edge of sunlight on the moon.\n\nWhat are the implications of Norton\u2019s material theory when it\ncomes to evaluating analogical arguments? The fact of the\nanalogy is a local uniformity that powers the inference.\nNorton\u2019s theory works well when such a uniformity is patent or\nnaturally inferred. It doesn\u2019t work well when the uniformity is\nitself the target (rather than the driver) of the\ninference. That happens with explanatory analogies such as\n Example 5\n (the Acoustical Analogy), and mathematical analogies such as\n Example 7\n (Rectangles and Boxes). Similarly, the theory doesn\u2019t\nwork well when the underlying uniformity is unclear, as in\n Example 2\n (Life on other Planets),\n Example 4\n (Clay Pots), and many other cases. In short, if\nNorton\u2019s theory is accepted, then for most analogical arguments\nthere are no useful evaluation criteria.\n3.6.2 Field-specific criteria\n\nFor those who sympathize with Norton\u2019s skepticism about\nuniversal inductive schemes and theories of analogical reasoning, yet\nrecognize that his approach may be too local, an appealing strategy is\nto move up one level. We can aim for field-specific \u201cworking\nlogics\u201d (Toulmin 1958; Wylie and Chapman 2016; Reiss 2015). This\napproach has been adopted by philosophers of archaeology, evolutionary\nbiology and other historical sciences (Wylie and Chapman 2016; Currie\n2013; Currie 2016; Currie 2018). In place of schemas, we find\n\u2018toolkits\u2019, i.e., lists of criteria for evaluating\nanalogical reasoning.\n\nFor example, Currie (2016) explores in detail the use of ethnographic\nanalogy\n (Example 13)\n between shamanistic motifs used by the contemporary San people and\nsimilar motifs in ancient rock art, found both among ancestors of the\nSan (direct historical analogy) and in European rock art (indirect\nhistorical analogy). Analogical arguments support the hypothesis that\nin each of these cultures, rock art symbolizes hallucinogenic\nexperiences. Currie examines criteria that focus on assumptions about\nstability of cultural traits and environment-culture relationships.\nCurrie (2016, 2018) and Wylie (Wylie and Chapman 2016) also stress the\nimportance of robustness reasoning that combines analogical arguments\nof moderate strength with other forms of evidence to yield strong\nconclusions.\n\nPractice-based approaches can thus yield specific guidelines unlikely\nto be matched by any general theory of analogical reasoning. One\ncaveat is worth mentioning. Field-specific criteria for ethnographic\nanalogy are elicited against a background of decades of methodological\ncontroversy (Wylie and Chapman 2016). Critics and defenders of\nethnographic analogy have appealed to general models of scientific\nmethod (e.g., hypothetico-deductive method or Bayesian confirmation).\nTo advance the methodological debate, practice-based approaches must\neither make connections to these general models or explain why the\nlack of any such connection is unproblematic.\n3.6.3 Formal analogies in physics\n\nClose attention to analogical arguments in practice can also provide\nvaluable challenges to general ideas about analogical inference. In an\ninteresting discussion, Steiner (1989, 1998) suggests that many of the\nanalogies that played a major role in early twentieth-century physics\ncount as \u201cPythagorean.\u201d The term is meant to connote\nmathematical mysticism: a \u201cPythagorean\u201d analogy is a\npurely formal analogy, one founded on mathematical similarities that\nhave no known physical basis at the time it is proposed. One example\nis Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s use of analogy\n (Example 14)\n to \u201cguess\u201d the form of the relativistic wave equation. In\nSteiner\u2019s view, Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s reasoning relies upon\nmanipulations and substitutions based on purely mathematical\nanalogies. Steiner argues that the success, and even the plausibility,\nof such analogies \u201cevokes, or should evoke, puzzlement\u201d\n(1989: 454). Both Hesse (1966) and Bartha (2010) reject the idea that\na purely formal analogy, with no physical significance, can support a\nplausible analogical inference in physics. Thus, Steiner\u2019s\narguments provide a serious challenge.\n\nBartha (2010) suggests a response: we can decompose Steiner\u2019s\nexamples into two or more steps, and then establish that at least one\nstep does, in fact, have a physical basis. Fraser (forthcoming),\nhowever, offers a counterexample that supports Steiner\u2019s\nposition. Complex analogies between classical statistical mechanics\n(CSM) and quantum field theory (QFT) have played a crucial role in the\ndevelopment and application of renormalization group (RG) methods in\nboth theories\n (Example 15).\n Fraser notes substantial physical disanalogies between CSM and QFT,\nand concludes that the reasoning is based entirely on formal\nanalogies.\n4. Philosophical foundations for analogical reasoning\n\nWhat philosophical basis can be provided for reasoning by analogy?\nWhat justification can be given for the claim that analogical\narguments deliver plausible conclusions? There have been several ideas\nfor answering this question. One natural strategy assimilates\nanalogical reasoning to some other well-understood argument pattern, a\nform of deductive or inductive reasoning\n (\u00a74.1,\n \u00a74.2). A few philosophers have explored the possibility of\na priori justification\n (\u00a74.3).\n A pragmatic justification may be available for practical applications\nof analogy, notably in legal reasoning\n (\u00a74.4).\n\nAny attempt to provide a general justification for analogical\nreasoning faces a basic dilemma. The demands of generality require a\nhigh-level formulation of the problem and hence an abstract\ncharacterization of analogical arguments, such as schema (4). On the\nother hand, as noted previously, many analogical arguments that\nconform to schema (4) are bad arguments. So a general justification of\nanalogical reasoning cannot provide support for all arguments that\nconform to (4), on pain of proving too much. Instead, it must first\nspecify a subset of putatively \u2018good\u2019 analogical\narguments, and link the general justification to this specified\nsubset. The problem of justification is linked to the\nproblem of characterizing good analogical arguments. This\ndifficulty afflicts some of the strategies described in this\nsection.\n4.1 Deductive justification\n\nAnalogical reasoning may be cast in a deductive mold. If\nsuccessful, this strategy neatly solves the problem of justification.\nA valid deductive argument is as good as it gets.\n\nAn early version of the deductivist approach is exemplified by\nAristotle\u2019s treatment of the argument from example\n (\u00a73.2),\n the paradeigma. On this analysis, an analogical argument\nbetween source domain \\(S\\) and target \\(T\\) begins with the\nassumption of positive analogy \\(P(S)\\) and \\(P(T)\\), as well as the\nadditional information \\(Q(S)\\). It proceeds via the generalization\n\\(\\forall x(P(x) \\supset Q(x))\\) to the conclusion: \\(Q(T)\\). Provided\nwe can treat that intermediate generalization as an independent\npremise, we have a deductively valid argument. Notice, though, that\nthe existence of the generalization renders the analogy irrelevant. We\ncan derive \\(Q(T)\\) from the generalization and \\(P(T)\\), without any\nknowledge of the source domain. The literature on analogy in\nargumentation theory\n (\u00a72.2)\n offers further perspectives on this type of analysis, and on the\nquestion of whether analogical arguments are properly characterized as\ndeductive.\n\nSome recent analyses follow Aristotle in treating analogical arguments\nas reliant upon extra (sometimes tacit) premises, typically drawn from\nbackground knowledge, that convert the inference into a deductively\nvalid argument\u2013\u2013but without making the source domain\nirrelevant. Davies and Russell introduce a version that relies upon\nwhat they call determination rules (Russell 1986; Davies and\nRussell 1987; Davies 1988). Suppose that \\(Q\\) and \\(P_1 , \\ldots\n,P_m\\) are variables, and we have background knowledge that the value\nof \\(Q\\) is determined by the values of \\(P_1 , \\ldots ,P_m\\). In the\nsimplest case, where \\(m = 1\\) and both \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) are binary\nBoolean variables, this reduces to \n\n\\[\\tag{8}\n\\forall x(P(x) \\supset Q(x)) \\vee \\forall x(P(x) \\supset{\\sim}Q(x)), \n\\]\n\n\ni.e., whether or not \\(P\\) holds determines whether or not \\(Q\\)\nholds. More generally, the form of a determination rule is\n\n\\[\\tag{9}\nQ = F(P_1 , \\ldots ,P_m), \n\\]\n\n\ni.e., \\(Q\\) is a function of \\(P_1,\\ldots\\), \\(P_m\\). If we assume\nsuch a rule as part of our background knowledge, then an analogical\nargument with conclusion \\(Q(T)\\) is deductively valid. More\nprecisely, and allowing for the case where \\(Q\\) is not a binary\nvariable: if we have such a rule, and also premises stating that the\nsource \\(S\\) agrees with the target \\(T\\) on all of the values\n\\(P_i\\), then we may validly infer that \\(Q(T) = Q(S)\\).\n\nThe \u201cdetermination rule\u201d analysis provides a clear and\nsimple justification for analogical reasoning. Note that, in contrast\nto the Aristotelian analysis via the generalization \\(\\forall x(P(x)\n\\supset Q(x))\\), a determination rule does not trivialize the\nanalogical argument. Only by combining the rule with information about\nthe source domain can we derive the value of \\(Q(T)\\). To illustrate\nby adapting one of the examples given by Russell and Davies\n (Example 16),\n let\u2019s suppose that the value \\((Q)\\) of a used car (relative to\na particular buyer) is determined by its year, make, mileage,\ncondition, color and accident history (the variables \\(P_i)\\). It\ndoesn\u2019t matter if one or more of these factors are redundant or\nirrelevant. Provided two cars are indistinguishable on each of these\npoints, they will have the same value. Knowledge of the source domain\nis necessary; we can\u2019t derive the value of the second car from\nthe determination rule alone. Weitzenfeld (1984) proposes a variant of\nthis approach, advancing the slightly more general thesis that\nanalogical arguments are deductive arguments with a missing\n(enthymematic) premise that amounts to a determination rule.\n\nDo determination rules give us a solution to the problem of providing\na justification for analogical arguments? In general: no. Analogies\nare commonly applied to problems such as\n Example 8\n (morphine and meperidine), where we are not even aware of\nall relevant factors, let alone in possession of a determination rule.\nMedical researchers conduct drug tests on animals without knowing all\nattributes that might be relevant to the effects of the drug. Indeed,\none of the main objectives of such testing is to guard against\nreactions unanticipated by theory. On the \u201cdetermination\nrule\u201d analysis, we must either limit the scope of such arguments\nto cases where we have a well-supported determination rule, or focus\nattention on formulating and justifying an appropriate determination\nrule. For cases such as animal testing, neither option seems\nrealistic.\n\nRecasting analogy as a deductive argument may help to bring out\nbackground assumptions, but it makes little headway with the problem\nof justification. That problem re-appears as the need to state and\nestablish the plausibility of a determination rule, and that is at\nleast as difficult as justifying the original analogical argument.\n4.2 Inductive justification\n\nSome philosophers have attempted to portray, and justify, analogical\nreasoning in terms of some well-understood inductive argument pattern.\nThere have been three moderately popular versions of this strategy.\nThe first treats analogical reasoning as generalization from a single\ncase. The second treats it as a kind of sampling argument. The third\nrecognizes the argument from analogy as a distinctive form, but treats\npast successes as evidence for future success.\n4.2.1 Single-case induction\n\nLet\u2019s reconsider Aristotle\u2019s argument from example or\nparadeigma\n (\u00a73.2),\n but this time regard the generalization as justified via induction\nfrom a single case (the source domain). Can such a simple analysis of\nanalogical arguments succeed? In general: no.\n\nA single instance can sometimes lead to a justified generalization.\nCartwright (1992) argues that we can sometimes generalize from a\nsingle careful experiment, \u201cwhere we have sufficient control of\nthe materials and our knowledge of the requisite background\nassumptions is secure\u201d (51). Cartwright thinks that we can do\nthis, for example, in experiments with compounds that have stable\n\u201cAristotelian natures.\u201d In a similar spirit, Quine (1969)\nmaintains that we can have instantial confirmation when dealing with\nnatural kinds.\n\nEven if we accept that there are such cases, the objection to\nunderstanding all analogical arguments as single-case induction is\nobvious: the view is simply too restrictive. Most analogical arguments\nwill not meet the requisite conditions. We may not know that we are\ndealing with a natural kind or Aristotelian nature when we make the\nanalogical argument. We may not know which properties are essential.\nAn insistence on the \u2018single-case induction\u2019 analysis of\nanalogical reasoning is likely to lead to skepticism (Agassi 1964,\n1988).\n\nInterpreting the argument from analogy as single-case induction is\nalso counter-productive in another way. The simplistic analysis does\nnothing to advance the search for criteria that help us to distinguish\nbetween relevant and irrelevant similarities, and hence between good\nand bad analogical arguments.\n4.2.2 Sampling arguments\n\nOn the sampling conception of analogical arguments, acknowledged\nsimilarities between two domains are treated as statistically relevant\nevidence for further similarities. The simplest version of the\nsampling argument is due to Mill (1843/1930). An argument from\nanalogy, he writes, is \u201ca competition between the known points\nof agreement and the known points of difference.\u201d Agreement of\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\) in 9 out of 10 properties implies a probability of 0.9\nthat \\(B\\) will possess any other property of \\(A\\): \u201cwe can\nreasonably expect resemblance in the same proportion\u201d (367). His\nonly restriction has to do with sample size: we must be relatively\nknowledgeable about both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). Mill saw no difficulty in\nusing analogical reasoning to infer characteristics of newly\ndiscovered species of plants or animals, given our extensive knowledge\nof botany and zoology. But if the extent of unascertained properties\nof \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is large, similarity in a small sample would not be\na reliable guide; hence, Mill\u2019s dismissal of Reid\u2019s\nargument about life on other planets\n (Example 2).\n\nThe sampling argument is presented in more explicit mathematical form\nby Harrod (1956). The key idea is that the known properties of \\(S\\)\n(the source domain) may be considered a random sample of all\n\\(S\\)\u2019s properties\u2014random, that is, with respect to the\nattribute of also belonging to \\(T\\) (the target domain). If the\nmajority of known properties that belong to \\(S\\) also belong to\n\\(T\\), then we should expect most other properties of \\(S\\) to belong\nto \\(T\\), for it is unlikely that we would have come to know just the\ncommon properties. In effect, Harrod proposes a binomial distribution,\nmodeling \u2018random selection\u2019 of properties on random\nselection of balls from an urn.\n\nThere are grave difficulties with Harrod\u2019s and Mill\u2019s\nanalyses. One obvious difficulty is the counting\nproblem: the \u2018population\u2019 of properties is poorly\ndefined. How are we to count similarities and differences? The ratio\nof shared to total known properties varies dramatically according to\nhow we do this. A second serious difficulty is the problem of\nbias: we cannot justify the assumption that the sample of known\nfeatures is random. In the case of the urn, the selection process is\narranged so that the result of each choice is not influenced by the\nagent\u2019s intentions or purposes, or by prior choices. By\ncontrast, the presentation of an analogical argument is always\npartisan. Bias enters into the initial representation of similarities\nand differences: an advocate of the argument will highlight\nsimilarities, while a critic will play up differences. The paradigm of\nrepeated selection from an urn seems totally inappropriate. Additional\nvariations of the sampling approach have been developed (e.g., Russell\n1988), but ultimately these versions also fail to solve either the\ncounting problem or the problem of bias.\n4.2.3 Argument from past success\n\nSection\n 3.6\n discussed Steiner\u2019s view that appeal to\n\u2018Pythagorean\u2019 analogies in physics \u201cevokes, or\nshould evoke, puzzlement\u201d (1989: 454). Liston (2000) offers a\npossible response: physicists are entitled to use Pythagorean\nanalogies on the basis of induction from their past success:\n\n\n[The scientist] can admit that no one knows how [Pythagorean]\nreasoning works and argue that the very fact that similar strategies\nhave worked well in the past is already reason enough to continue\npursuing them hoping for success in the present instance. (200)\n\n\nSetting aside familiar worries about arguments from success, the real\nproblem here is to determine what counts as a similar strategy. In\nessence, that amounts to isolating the features of successful\nPythagorean analogies. As we have seen (\u00a72.4), nobody has yet\nprovided a satisfactory scheme that characterizes successful\nanalogical arguments, let alone successful Pythagorean analogical\narguments.\n4.3 A priori justification\n\nAn a priori approach traces the validity of a pattern of\nanalogical reasoning, or of a particular analogical argument, to some\nbroad and fundamental principle. Three such approaches will be\noutlined here.\n\nThe first is due to Keynes (1921). Keynes appeals to his famous\nPrinciple of the Limitation of Independent Variety, which he\narticulates as follows:\n\n(LIV) \n The amount of variety in the universe is limited in such a way\nthat there is no one object so complex that its qualities fall into an\ninfinite number of independent groups (i.e., groups which might exist\nindependently as well as in conjunction) (1921: 258). \n\n\nArmed with this Principle and some additional assumptions, Keynes is\nable to show that in cases where there is no negative\nanalogy, knowledge of the positive analogy increases the\n(logical) probability of the conclusion. If there is a non-trivial\nnegative analogy, however, then the probability of the conclusion\nremains unchanged, as was pointed out by Hesse (1966). Those familiar\nwith Carnap\u2019s theory of logical probability will recognize that\nin setting up his framework, Keynes settled on a measure that permits\nno learning from experience.\n\nHesse offers a refinement of Keynes\u2019s strategy, once again along\nCarnapian lines. In her (1974), she proposes what she calls the\nClustering Postulate: the assumption that our epistemic\nprobability function has a built-in bias towards generalization. The\nobjections to such postulates of uniformity are well-known (see Salmon\n1967), but even if we waive them, her argument fails. The main\nobjection here\u2014which also applies to Keynes\u2014is that a\npurely syntactic axiom such as the Clustering Postulate fails\nto discriminate between analogical arguments that are good and those\nthat are clearly without value (according to Hesse\u2019s own\nmaterial criteria, for example).\n\nA different a priori strategy, proposed by Bartha (2010),\nlimits the scope of justification to analogical arguments that satisfy\ntentative criteria for \u2018good\u2019 analogical reasoning. The\ncriteria are those specified by the articulation model\n (\u00a73.5).\n In simplified form, they require the existence of non-trivial\npositive analogy and no known critical disanalogy. The scope of\nBartha\u2019s argument is also limited to analogical arguments\ndirected at establishing prima facie plausibility, rather\nthan degree of probability.\n\nBartha\u2019s argument rests on a principle of symmetry reasoning\narticulated by van Fraassen (1989: 236): \u201cproblems which are\nessentially the same must receive essentially the same\nsolution.\u201d A modal extension of this principle runs roughly as\nfollows: if problems might be essentially the same, then they\nmight have essentially the same solution. There are two\nmodalities here. Bartha argues that satisfaction of the criteria of\nthe articulation model is sufficient to establish the modality in the\nantecedent, i.e., that the source and target domains \u2018might be\nessentially the same\u2019 in relevant respects. He further suggests\nthat prima facie plausibility provides a reasonable reading\nof the modality in the consequent, i.e., that the problems in the two\ndomains \u2018might have essentially the same solution.\u2019 To\ncall a hypothesis prima facie plausible is to elevate it to\nthe point where it merits investigation, since it might be\ncorrect.\n\nThe argument is vulnerable to two sorts of concerns. First, there are\nquestions about the interpretation of the symmetry principle. Second,\nthere is a residual worry that this justification, like all the\nothers, proves too much. The articulation model may be too vague or\ntoo permissive.\n4.4 Pragmatic justification\n\nArguably, the most promising available defense of analogical reasoning\nmay be found in its application to case law (see\n Precedent and Analogy in Legal Reasoning).\n Judicial decisions are based on the verdicts and reasoning that have\ngoverned relevantly similar cases, according to the doctrine of\nstare decisis (Levi 1949; Llewellyn 1960; Cross and Harris\n1991; Sunstein 1993). Individual decisions by a court are\nbinding on that court and lower courts; judges are obligated\nto decide future cases \u2018in the same way.\u2019 That is, the\nreasoning applied in an individual decision, referred to as the\nratio decidendi, must be applied to similar future cases (see\n Example 10).\n In practice, of course, the situation is extremely complex. No two\ncases are identical. The ratio must be understood in the\ncontext of the facts of the original case, and there is considerable\nroom for debate about its generality and its applicability to future\ncases. If a consensus emerges that a past case was wrongly decided,\nlater judgments will distinguish it from new cases,\neffectively restricting the scope of the ratio to the\noriginal case.\n\nThe practice of following precedent can be justified by two main\npractical considerations. First, and above all, the practice is\nconservative: it provides a relatively stable basis for\nreplicable decisions. People need to be able to predict the actions of\nthe courts and formulate plans accordingly. Stare decisis\nserves as a check against arbitrary judicial decisions. Second, the\npractice is still reasonably progressive: it allows for the\ngradual evolution of the law. Careful judges distinguish bad\ndecisions; new values and a new consensus can emerge in a series of\ndecisions over time.\n\nIn theory, then, stare decisis strikes a healthy balance\nbetween conservative and progressive social values. This justification\nis pragmatic. It pre-supposes a common set of social values, and links\nthe use of analogical reasoning to optimal promotion of those values.\nNotice also that justification occurs at the level of the practice in\ngeneral; individual analogical arguments sometimes go astray. A full\nexamination of the nature and foundations for stare decisis\nis beyond the scope of this entry, but it is worth asking the\nquestion: might it be possible to generalize the justification for\nstare decisis? Is a parallel pragmatic justification\navailable for analogical arguments in general?\n\nBartha (2010) offers a preliminary attempt to provide such a\njustification by shifting from social values to epistemic values. The\ngeneral idea is that reasoning by analogy is especially well suited to\nthe attainment of a common set of epistemic goals or values. In simple\nterms, analogical reasoning\u2014when it conforms to certain\ncriteria\u2014achieves an excellent (perhaps optimal) balance between\nthe competing demands of stability and innovation. It supports both\nconservative epistemic values, such as simplicity and coherence with\nexisting belief, and progressive epistemic values, such as\nfruitfulness and theoretical unification (McMullin (1993) provides a\nclassic list).\n5. Beyond analogical arguments\n\nAs emphasized earlier, analogical reasoning takes in a great\ndeal more than analogical arguments. In this section, we examine two\nbroad contexts in which analogical reasoning is important.\n\nThe first, still closely linked to analogical arguments, is the\nconfirmation of scientific hypotheses. Confirmation is the process by\nwhich a scientific hypothesis receives inductive support on the basis\nof evidence (see\n evidence,\n confirmation, and\n Bayes\u2019 Theorem).\n Confirmation may also signify the logical relationship of\ninductive support that obtains between a hypothesis \\(H\\) and a\nproposition \\(E\\) that expresses the relevant evidence. Can analogical\narguments play a role, either in the process or in the logical\nrelationship? Arguably yes (to both), but this role has to be\ndelineated carefully, and several obstacles remain in the way of a\nclear account.\n\nThe second context is conceptual and theoretical development\nin cutting-edge scientific research. Analogies are used to suggest\npossible extensions of theoretical concepts and ideas. The reasoning\nis linked to considerations of plausibility, but there is no\nstraightforward analysis in terms of analogical arguments.\n5.1 Analogy and confirmation\n\nHow is analogical reasoning related to the confirmation of scientific\nhypotheses? The examples and philosophical discussion from earlier\nsections suggest that a good analogical argument can indeed provide\nsupport for a hypothesis. But there are good reasons to doubt the\nclaim that analogies provide actual confirmation.\n\nIn the first place, there is a logical difficulty. To appreciate this,\nlet us concentrate on confirmation as a relationship between\npropositions. Christensen (1999: 441) offers a helpful general\ncharacterization:\n\nSome propositions seem to help make it rational to believe other\npropositions. When our current confidence in \\(E\\) helps make rational\nour current confidence in \\(H\\), we say that \\(E\\) confirms \\(H\\).\n\nIn the Bayesian model, \u2018confidence\u2019 is represented in\nterms of subjective probability. A Bayesian agent starts with an\nassignment of subjective probabilities to a class of propositions.\nConfirmation is understood as a three-place relation:\n\n(11) \n Bayesian confirmation\n\n\\(E\\) confirms \\(H\\) relative to \\(K \\leftrightarrow Pr(H \\mid E \\cdot\nK) \\gt Pr(H \\mid K)\\). \n\n\n\\(E\\) represents a proposition about accepted evidence, \\(H\\) stands\nfor a hypothesis, \\(K\\) for background knowledge and \\(Pr\\) for the\nagent\u2019s subjective probability function. To confirm \\(H\\) is to\nraise its conditional probability, relative to \\(K\\). The shift from\nprior probability \\(Pr(H \\mid K)\\) to posterior\nprobability \\(Pr(H \\mid E \\cdot K)\\) is referred to as\nconditionalization on \\(E\\). The relation between these two\nprobabilities is typically given by Bayes\u2019 Theorem (setting\naside more complex forms of conditionalization): \n\n\\[\\tag{12}\nPr(H \\mid E \\cdot K) = \\frac{Pr(H \\mid K) Pr(E \\mid H \\cdot K)}{Pr(E \\mid K)}\n\\]\n\n\nFor Bayesians, here is the logical difficulty: it seems that an\nanalogical argument cannot provide confirmation. In the first place,\nit is not clear that we can encapsulate the information contained in\nan analogical argument in a single proposition, \\(E\\). Second, even if\nwe can formulate a proposition \\(E\\) that expresses that information,\nit is typically not appropriate to treat it as evidence because the\ninformation contained in \\(E\\) is already part of the\nbackground, \\(K\\). This means that \\(E \\cdot K\\) is equivalent to\n\\(K\\), and hence \\(Pr(H \\mid E \\cdot K) = Pr(H \\mid K)\\). According to\nthe Bayesian definition, we don\u2019t have confirmation. (This is a\nversion of the problem of old evidence; see\n confirmation.)\n Third, and perhaps most important, analogical arguments are often\napplied to novel hypotheses \\(H\\) for which the prior probability\n\\(Pr(H \\mid K)\\) is not even defined. Again, the definition of\nconfirmation in terms of Bayesian conditionalization seems\ninapplicable.\n\nIf analogies don\u2019t provide inductive support via ordinary\nconditionalization, is there an alternative? Here we face a second\ndifficulty, once again most easily stated within a Bayesian framework.\nVan Fraassen (1989) has a well-known objection to any belief-updating\nrule other than conditionalization. This objection applies to any rule\nthat allows us to boost credences when there is no new evidence. The\ncriticism, made vivid by the tale of Bayesian Peter, is that these\n\u2018ampliative\u2019 rules are vulnerable to a\n Dutch Book.\n Adopting any such rule would lead us to acknowledge as fair a system\nof bets that foreseeably leads to certain loss. Any rule of this type\nfor analogical reasoning appears to be vulnerable to van\nFraassen\u2019s objection.\n\nThere appear to be at least three routes to avoiding these\ndifficulties and finding a role for analogical arguments within\nBayesian epistemology. First, there is what we might call minimal\nBayesianism. Within the Bayesian framework, some writers\n(Jeffreys 1973; Salmon 1967, 1990; Shimony 1970) have argued that a\n\u2018seriously proposed\u2019 hypothesis must have a sufficiently\nhigh prior probability to allow it to become preferred as the result\nof observation. Salmon has suggested that analogical reasoning is one\nof the most important means of showing that a hypothesis is\n\u2018serious\u2019 in this sense. If analogical reasoning is\ndirected primarily towards prior probability assignments, it\ncan provide inductive support while remaining formally distinct from\nconfirmation, avoiding the logical difficulties noted above. This\napproach is minimally Bayesian because it provides nothing more than\nan entry point into the Bayesian apparatus, and it only applies to\nnovel hypotheses. An orthodox Bayesian, such as de Finetti (de Finetti\nand Savage 1972, de Finetti 1974), might have no problem in allowing\nthat analogies play this role.\n\nThe second approach is liberal Bayesianism: we can change our\nprior probabilities in a non-rule-based fashion. Something\nalong these lines is needed if analogical arguments are supposed to\nshift opinion about an already existing hypothesis without\nany new evidence. This is common in fields such as archaeology, as\npart of a strategy that Wylie refers to as \u201cmobilizing old data\nas new evidence\u201d (Wylie and Chapman 2016: 95). As Hawthorne\n(2012) notes, some Bayesians simply accept that both initial\nassignments and ongoing revision of prior probabilities\n(based on plausibility arguments) can be rational, but\n\nthe logic of Bayesian induction (as described here) has\nnothing to say about what values the prior plausibility assessments\nfor hypotheses should have; and it places no restrictions on how they\nmight change.\n\nIn other words, by not stating any rules for this type of probability\nrevision, we avoid the difficulties noted by van Fraassen. This\napproach admits analogical reasoning into the Bayesian tent, but\nacknowledges a dark corner of the tent in which rationality operates\nwithout any clear rules.\n\nRecently, a third approach has attracted interest: analogue\nconfirmation or confirmation via analogue simulation. As\ndescribed in (Dardashti et al. 2017), the idea is as follows:\n\n\nOur key idea is that, in certain circumstances, predictions concerning\ninaccessible phenomena can be confirmed via an analogue simulation in\na different system. (57)\n\n\nDardashti and his co-authors concentrate on a particular example\n (Example 17):\n \u2018dumb holes\u2019 and other analogues to gravitational black\nholes (Unruh 1981; Unruh 2008). Unlike real black holes, some of these\nanalogues can be (and indeed have been) implemented and studied in the\nlab. Given the exact formal analogy between our models for these\nsystems and our models of black holes, and certain important\nadditional assumptions, Dardashti et al. make the controversial claim\nthat observations made about the analogues provide evidence about\nactual black holes. For instance, the observation of phenomena\nanalogous to Hawking radiation in the analogue systems would provide\nconfirmation for the existence of Hawking radiation in black holes. In\na second paper (Dardashti et al. 2018, Other Internet Resources), the\ncase for confirmation is developed within a Bayesian framework.\n\nThe appeal of a clearly articulated mechanism for analogue\nconfirmation is obvious. It would provide a tool for exploring\nconfirmation of inaccessible phenomena not just in cosmology, but also\nin historical sciences such as archaeology and evolutionary biology,\nand in areas of medical science where ethical constraints rule out\nexperiments on human subjects. Furthermore, as noted by Dardashti et\nal., analogue confirmation relies on new evidence obtained\nfrom the analogue system, and is therefore not vulnerable to the\nlogical difficulties noted above.\n\nAlthough the concept of analogue confirmation is not entirely new\n(think of animal testing, as in\n Example 8),\n the claims of (Dardashti et al. 2017, 2018 [Other Internet\nResources]) require evaluation. One immediate difficulty for the black\nhole example: if we think in terms of ordinary analogical arguments,\nthere is no positive analogy because, to put it simply, we\nhave no basis of known similarities between a \u2018dumb hole\u2019\nand a black hole. As Crowther et al. (2018, Other Internet Resources)\nargue, \u201cit is not known if the particular modelling framework\nused in the derivation of Hawking radiation actually describes\nblack holes in the first place.\u201d This may not concern\nDardashti et al., since they claim that analogue confirmation is\ndistinct from ordinary analogical arguments. It may turn out that\nanalogue confirmation is different for cases such as animal testing,\nwhere we have a basis of known similarities, and for cases where our\nonly access to the target domain is via a theoretical model.\n5.2 Conceptual change and theory development\n\nIn\n \u00a73.6,\n we saw that practice-based studies of analogy provide insight into\nthe criteria for evaluating analogical arguments. Such studies also\npoint to dynamical or programmatic roles for\nanalogies, which appear to require evaluative frameworks that go\nbeyond those developed for analogical arguments.\n\nKnuttila and Loettgers (2014) examine the role of analogical reasoning\nin synthetic biology, an interdisciplinary field that draws on\nphysics, chemistry, biology, engineering and computational science.\nThe main role for analogies in this field is not the construction of\nindividual analogical arguments but rather the development of concepts\nsuch as \u201cnoise\u201d and \u201cfeedback loops\u201d. Such\nconcepts undergo constant refinement, guided by both positive and\nnegative analogies to their analogues in engineered and physical\nsystems. Analogical reasoning here is \u201ctransient, heterogeneous,\nand programmatic\u201d (87). Negative analogies, seen as problematic\nobstacles for individual analogical arguments, take on a prominent and\nconstructive role when the focus is theoretical construction and\nconcept refinement.\n\nSimilar observations apply to analogical reasoning in its application\nto another cutting-edge field: emergent gravity. In this area of\nphysics, distinct theoretical approaches portray gravity as emerging\nfrom different microstructures (Linneman and Visser 2018).\n\u201cNovel and robust\u201d features not present at the micro-level\nemerge in the gravitational theory. Analogies with other emergent\nphenomena, such as hydrodynamics and thermodynamics, are exploited to\nshape these proposals. As with synthetic biology, analogical reasoning\nis not directed primarily towards the formulation and assessment of\nindividual arguments. Rather, its role is to develop different\ntheoretical models of gravity.\n\nThese studies explore fluid and creative applications of analogy to\nshape concepts on the front lines of scientific research. An adequate\nanalysis would certainly take us beyond the analysis of individual\nanalogical arguments, which have been the focus of our attention.\nKnuttila and Loettgers (2014) are led to reject the idea that the\nindividual analogical argument is the \u201cprimary unit\u201d in\nanalogical reasoning, but this is a debatable conclusion. Linneman and\nVisser (2018), for instance, explicitly affirm the importance of\nassessing the case for different gravitational models through\n\u201cexemplary analogical arguments\u201d:\n\n\nWe have taken up the challenge of making explicit arguments in favour\nof an emergent gravity paradigm\u2026 That arguments can only be\nplausibility arguments at the heuristic level does not mean that they\nare immune to scrutiny and critical assessment tout court. The\nphilosopher of physics\u2019 job in the process of discovery of\nquantum gravity\u2026 should amount to providing exactly this kind\nof assessments. (Linneman and Visser 2018: 12)\n\n\nAccordingly, Linneman and Visser formulate explicit analogical\narguments for each model of emergent gravity, and assess them using\nfamiliar criteria for evaluating individual analogical arguments.\nArguably, even the most ambitious heuristic objectives still depend\nupon considerations of plausibility that benefit by being expressed,\nand examined, in terms of analogical arguments.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Achinstein, P., 1964, \u201cModels, Analogies and\nTheories,\u201d <em>Philosophy of Science</em>, 31:\n328\u2013349.", "Agassi, J., 1964, \u201cDiscussion: Analogies as\nGeneralizations,\u201d <em>Philosophy of Science</em>, 31:\n351\u2013356.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1988, \u201cAnalogies Hard and\nSoft,\u201d in D.H.
