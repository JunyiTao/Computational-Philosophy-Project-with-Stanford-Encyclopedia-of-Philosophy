Democracy Defined\n\nThe term \u201cdemocracy\u201d, as we will use it in this entry,\nrefers very generally to a method of collective decision making\ncharacterized by a kind of equality among the participants at an\nessential stage of the decision-making process. Four aspects of this\ndefinition should be noted. First, democracy concerns collective\ndecision making, by which we mean decisions that are made for groups\nand are meant to be binding on all the members of the group. Second,\nwe intend for this definition to cover many different kinds of groups\nand decision-making procedures that may be called democratic. So there\ncan be democracy in families, voluntary organizations, economic firms,\nas well as states and transnational and global organizations. The\ndefinition is also consistent with different electoral systems, for\nexample first-past-the-post voting and proportional representation.\nThird, the definition is not intended to carry any normative weight.\nIt is compatible with this definition of democracy that it is not\ndesirable to have democracy in some particular context. So the\ndefinition of democracy does not settle any normative questions.\nFourth, the equality required by the definition of democracy may be\nmore or less deep. It may be the mere formal equality of one-person\none-vote in an election for representatives to a parliament where\nthere is competition among candidates for the position. Or it may be\nmore robust, including substantive equality in the processes of\ndeliberation and coalition building leading up to the vote.\n\u201cDemocracy\u201d may refer to any of these political\narrangements. It may involve direct referenda of the members of a\nsociety in deciding on the laws and policies of the society or it may\ninvolve the participation of those members in selecting\nrepresentatives to make the decisions.\n\nThe function of normative democratic theory is not to settle questions\nof definition but to determine which, if any, of the forms democracy\nmay take are morally desirable and when and how. To evaluate different\nmoral justifications of democracy, we must decide on the merits of the\ndifferent principles and conceptions of human beings and society from\nwhich they proceed.\n2. The Justification of Democracy\n\nIn this section, we examine different views concerning the\njustification of democracy. Proposed justifications of democracy\nidentify values or reasons that support democracy over alternative\nforms of decision-making, such as oligarchy or dictatorship. It is\nimportant to distinguish views concerning the justification\nof democracy from views concerning the authority of\ndemocracy, which we examine in\n section 3.\n Attempts to establish democratic authority identify values or reasons\nin virtue of which subjects have a duty to obey democratic decisions.\nJustification and authority can come apart (Simmons 2001: ch.\n7)\u2014it is possible to hold that the balance of values or reasons\nsupports democracy over alternative forms of decision-making while\ndenying that subjects have a duty to obey democratic decisions.\n\nWe can evaluate the justification of democracy along at least two\ndifferent dimensions: instrumentally, by reference to the outcomes of\nusing it compared with other methods of political decision; or\nintrinsically, by reference to values that are inherent in the\nmethod.\n2.1 Instrumentalism\n2.1.1 Instrumental arguments in favor of democracy\n\nTwo kinds of in instrumental benefits are commonly attributed to\ndemocracy: (1) the production of relatively good laws and policies and\n(2) improvements in the characters of the participants.\n2.1.1.1 The production of relatively good laws and policies: responsiveness theories\n\nIt is often argued that democratic decision-making best protects\nsubjects\u2019 rights or interests because it is more responsive to\ntheir judgments or preferences than competing forms of government.\nJohn Stuart Mill, for example, argues that since democracy gives each\nsubject a share of political power, democracy forces decision-makers\nto take into account the rights and interests of a wider range of\nsubjects than are taken into account under aristocracy or monarchy\n(Mill 1861: ch. 3). There is some evidence that as groups are included\nin the democratic process, their interests are better advanced by the\npolitical system. For example, when African Americans regained the\nright to vote in the United States in 1965, they were able to secure\nmany more benefits from the state than previously (Wright 2013).\nEconomists argue that democracy promotes economic growth (Acemoglu et\nal. 2019). Several contemporary authors defend versions of this\ninstrumental argument by pointing to the robust empirical correlation\nbetween well-functioning democratic institutions and the strong\nprotection of core liberal rights, such as rights to a fair trial,\nbodily integrity, freedom of association, and freedom of expression\n(Gaus 1996: ch. 13; Christiano 2011; Gaus 2011: ch. 22).\n\nA related instrumental argument for democracy is provided by Amartya\nSen, who argues that \n\n\nno substantial famine has ever occurred in any independent country\nwith a democratic form of government and a relatively free press. (Sen\n1999: 152) \n\n\nThe basis of this argument is that politicians in a multiparty\ndemocracy with free elections and a free press have incentives to\nrespond to the expressions of needs of the poor.\n2.1.1.2 The production of relatively good laws and policies: epistemic theories\n\nEpistemic justifications of democracy argue that, under the right\nconditions, democracy is generally more reliable than alternative\nmethods at producing political decisions that are correct according to\nprocedure-independent standards. While there are many different\nexplanations for the reliability of democratic decision-making, we\noutline three of the most prominent explanations here: (1)\nCondorcet\u2019s Jury Theorem, (2) the effects of cognitive\ndiversity, and (3) information gathering and sharing. \n\nThe most prominent explanation for democracy\u2019s epistemic\nreliability rests on Condorcet\u2019s Jury Theorem (CJT), a\nmathematical theorem developed by eighteenth-century mathematician the\nMarquis de Condorcet that builds on the so-called \u201claw of large\nnumbers\u201d. CJT states that, when certain assumptions hold, the\nprobability that a majority of voters support the correct decision\nincreases and approaches one as the number of voters increases. The\nassumptions are (Condorcet 1785): \n\n each voter is more likely than not to identify the correct\ndecision (the competence assumption); \n voters vote for what they believe is the correct decision (the\nsincerity assumption); \n votes are statistically independent of one another (the\nindependence assumption). \n\n\nWhile Condorcet\u2019s original proof was restricted to decisions\nwith only two choices, more recent work argues that CJT can be\nextended to decisions with three or more choices (List & Goodin\n2001). The use of CJT to explain democracy\u2019s reliability\nis often thought to originate with Jean-Jacques Rousseau\u2019s claim\nthat \n\n\n[i]f, when a sufficiently informed populace deliberates, the citizens\nwere to have no communication among themselves, the general will would\nalways result from the large number of small differences, and the\ndeliberation would always be good. (Rousseau 1762: Book III, ch. IV)\n\n\n\nContemporary theorists continue to rely on CJT, or variants of it, to\njustify democracy (Barry 1965; Cohen 1986; Grofman and Feld 1988; Goodin & Spiekermann 2019).\n\nThe appeal of CJT for epistemic democrats derives from the fact that,\nif its underlying assumptions are satisfied, decisions produced by\neven moderately-sized electorates are almost certain to be correct.\nFor example, if the assumptions of CJT hold for an electorate of\n10,000 voters, and if each voter is 51 percent likely to identify the\ncorrect decision of two options, then the probability that a majority\nwill select the correct decision is 99.97 percent. The formal\nmathematics of CJT are not subject to dispute. However, critics of\nCJT-based arguments for democracy argue that the assumptions\nunderlying CJT are rarely, if ever, satisfied in actual democracies\n(see Black 1963: 159\u201365; Ladha 1992; Estlund 1997b; 2008: ch.\nXII; Anderson 2006). First, many have remarked that\nvoters\u2019 opinions are not independent of each other. Indeed, the\ndemocratic process seems to emphasize persuasion and coalition\nbuilding. Second, the theorem does not seem to apply to cases in which\nthe information that voters have access to, and on the basis of which\nthey make their judgments, is segmented in various ways. Segmentation\noccurs when some sectors of the society do not have the relevant\ninformation while others do have it. Modern societies and politics\nseem to instantiate this kind of segmentation in terms of class, race,\nethnic groupings, religion, occupational position, geographical place\nand so on. Finally, all voters approach issues they have to make\ndecisions on with strong ideological biases that undermine the claim\nthat each voter is bringing a kind of independent observation on the\nnature of the common good to the vote.\n\nAdvocates of CJT-based justifications of democracy generally respond\nto these sorts of criticisms by attempting to develop variations of\nCJT with weaker assumptions. These assumptions are more easily\nsatisfied in democracies and so the revised theorems may show that\neven moderately-sized electorates are almost certain to produce\ncorrect decisions (Grofman & Feld 1988; Austen-Smith 1992;\nAusten-Smith & Banks 1996).\n\nA second common epistemic justification for democracy\u2014which is\noften traced to Aristotle (Politics, Book II, Ch. 11; see\nWaldron 1995)\u2014argues that democratic procedures are best able to\nexploit the underlying cognitive diversity of large groups of citizens\nto solve collective problems. Since democracy brings a lot of people\ninto the process of decision making, it can take advantage of many\nsources of information and perspectives in assessing proposed laws and\npolicies. More recently, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Landemore (2013) has\ndrawn on the \u201cdiversity-trumps-ability\u201d theorem of Scott\nPage and Lu Hong (Hong & Page 2004; Page 2007)\u2014which states\nthat a random collection of agents drawn from a large set of\nlimited-ability agents typically outperforms a collection of the very\nbest agents from that same set\u2014to argue that democracy can be\nexpected to produce better decisions than rule by experts. Both Page\nand Hong\u2019s original theorem and Landemore\u2019s use of it to\njustify democracy are subject to dispute (see Quirk 2014; Brennan\n2014; Thompson 2014; Bajaj 2014).\n\nA third common epistemic justification for democracy relies on the\nidea that democratic decision-making tends to be more informed than\nother forms of decision-making about the interests of citizens and the\ncausal mechanisms necessary to advance those interests. John Dewey\nargues that democracy involves \u201ca consultation and a discussion\nwhich uncovers social needs and troubles\u201d. Even if experts know\nhow best to solve collective problems, they need input from the masses\nto correct their biases tell them where the problems lie (Dewey 1927\n[2012: 154\u2013155]; see also Anderson 2006; Knight & Johnson\n2011).\n2.1.1.3 Character-based arguments\n\nMany have endorsed democracy on the grounds that democracy has\nbeneficial effects on the characters of subjects. Many agree with Mill\nand Rousseau that democracy tends to make people stand up for\nthemselves more than other forms of rule do because it makes\ncollective decisions depend on their input more than monarchy or\naristocracy do. Hence, in democratic societies individuals are\nencouraged to be more autonomous. Relatedly, by giving citizens a\nshare of control over political-decision-making, democracy cultivates\ncitizens with active and productive characters rather than passive\ncharacters. In addition, it has been argued that democracy tends to\nget people to think carefully and rationally more than other forms of\nrule because it makes a difference to political outcomes whether they\ndo or not. Finally, some argue that democracy tends to enhance the\nmoral qualities of citizens. When they participate in making\ndecisions, they have to listen to others, they are called upon to\njustify themselves to others and they are forced to think in part in\nterms of the interests of others. Some have argued that when people\nfind themselves in this kind of circumstance, they can be expected\ngenuinely to think in terms of the common good and justice. Hence,\nsome have argued that democratic processes tend to enhance the\nautonomy, rationality, activity, and morality of participants. Since\nthese beneficial effects are thought to be worthwhile in themselves,\nthey count in favor of democracy and against other forms of rule (Mill\n1861 [1991: 74]; Elster 1986 [2003: 152]; Hannon 2020).\n\nSome argue in addition that the above effects on character tend to\nenhance the quality of legislation as well. A society of autonomous,\nrational, active, and moral decision-makers is more likely to produce\ngood legislation than a society ruled by a self-centered person or a\nsmall group of persons who rule over slavish and unreflective\nsubjects. Of course, the soundness of any of the above arguments\ndepends on the truth of the causal theories of the consequences of\ndifferent institutions.\n2.1.2 Instrumental arguments against democracy\n\nNot all instrumental arguments favor democracy. Plato argues that\ndemocracy is inferior to various forms of monarchy, aristocracy and\neven oligarchy on the grounds that democracy tends to undermine the\nexpertise necessary to the proper governance of societies (Plato 1974,\nBook VI). Most people do not have the kinds of intellectual talents\nthat enable them to think well about the difficult issues that\npolitics involves. But in order to win office or get a piece of\nlegislation passed, politicians must appeal to these people\u2019s\nsense of what is right or not right. Hence, the state will be guided\nby very poorly worked out ideas that experts in manipulation and mass\nappeal use to help themselves win office. Plato argues instead that\nthe state should be ruled by philosopher-kings who have the wisdom and\nmoral character required for good rule. He thus defends a version of\nwhat David Estlund calls \u201cepistocracy\u201d, a form of\noligarchy that involves rule by experts (Estlund 2003).\n\nMill defends a form of epistocracy that is sometimes referred to as\nthe \u201cplural voting\u201d scheme (1861: ch. 4). While all\nrational adults get at least one vote under this scheme, some citizens\nget a greater number of votes based on satisfying some measure of\npolitical expertise. While Mill identifies the relevant measure of\nexpertise in terms of formal education, the plural voting scheme is\nconsistent with other measures. This scheme might be thought to\ncombine the instrumental value of political expertise with the\nintrinsic value of broad inclusion.\n\nOne objection to any form of epistocracy\u2014the demographic\nobjection\u2014holds that any criterion of expertise is likely\nto select demographically homogeneous individuals who are be biased in\nways that undermine their ability to produce political outcomes that\npromote the general welfare (Estlund 2003).\n\nHobbes argues that democracy is inferior to monarchy because democracy\nfosters destabilizing dissension among subjects (Hobbes 1651: chap.\nXIX). On his view, individual citizens and even politicians are apt\nnot to have a sense of responsibility for the quality of legislation\nbecause no one makes a significant difference to the outcomes of\ndecision making. As a consequence, citizens\u2019 concerns are not\nfocused on politics and politicians succeed only by making loud and\nmanipulative appeals to citizens in order to gain more power, but all\nlack incentives to consider views that are genuinely for the common\ngood. Hence the sense of lack of responsibility for outcomes\nundermines politicians\u2019 concern for the common good and inclines\nthem to make sectarian and divisive appeals to citizens.\n\nMany contemporary theorists expand on these Platonic and Hobbesian\ncriticisms. A good deal of empirical data shows that citizens of\nlarge-scale democracies are ill-informed and apathetic about politics.\nThis makes room for special interests to control the behavior of\npoliticians and use the state for their own limited purposes all the\nwhile spreading the costs to everyone. Moreover, there is empirical\nevidence that democratic citizens often engage in motivated reasoning\nthat unconsciously aims to affirm their existing political identities\nrather than arrive at correct judgments (Lord, Ross, & Lepper\n1979; Bartels 2002; Kahan 2013; Achen & Bartels 2016). Some\ntheorists argue that these considerations justify abandoning democracy\naltogether, while modest versions of these arguments have been used to\njustify modification of democratic institutions (Caplan 2007; Somin\n2013; Brennan 2016). Relatedly, some theorists argue that rather than\nhaving beneficial effects on the characters of subjects as Mill and\nothers argue, democracy actually has deleterious effects on the\nsubjects\u2019 characters and relationships (Brennan 2016: ch.\n3).\n2.1.3 Grounds for instrumentalism\n\nPure instrumentalists argue that these instrumental arguments\nfor and against the democratic process are the only bases on which to\nevaluate the justification of democracy or compare it with other forms\nof political decision-making. There are a number of different kinds of\nargument for pure instrumentalism. One kind of argument proceeds from\na more general moral theory. For example, classical utilitarianism has\nno room in its monistic axiology for the intrinsic values of fairness\nand liberty or the intrinsic importance of an egalitarian distribution\nof political power. Its sole concern with maximizing\nutility\u2014understood as pleasure or desire\nsatisfaction\u2014guarantees that it can provide only instrumental\narguments for and against democracy. \n\nBut one need not be a thoroughgoing utilitarian to argue for\ninstrumentalism in democratic theory. There are arguments in favor of\ninstrumentalism that pertain directly to the question of democracy and\ncollective decision making generally. One argument states that\npolitical power involves the exercise of power of some over others.\nAnd it argues that the exercise of power of one person over another\ncan only be justified by reference to the protection of the interests\nor rights of the person over whom power is exercised. Thus no\ndistribution of political power could ever be justified except by\nreference to the quality of outcomes of the decision making process\n(Arneson 1993 [2002: 96\u201397]; 2003; 2004; 2009). Another sort of\nargument for instrumentalism proceeds negatively, attempting to show\nthat the non-instrumental values most commonly used in attempted\njustifications for democracy do not actually justify democracy, and\nthat an instrumental justification for democracy is therefore the only\navailable sort of justification (Wall 2007).\n\nOther arguments question the coherence of the idea of intrinsically\nfair collective decision making processes. For instance, social choice\ntheory questions the idea that there can be a fair decision making\nfunction that transforms a set of individual preferences into a\nrational collective preference. The core objection is that no general\nrule satisfying reasonable constraints can be devised that can\ntransform any set of individual preferences into a rational social\npreference. And this is taken to show that democratic procedures\ncannot be intrinsically fair (Riker 1982: 116). Ronald Dworkin argues that the idea of equality,\nwhich is for him at the root of social justice, cannot be given a\ncoherent and plausible interpretation when it comes to the\ndistribution of political power among members of the society. The\nrelation of politicians to citizens inevitably gives rise to\ninequality; the process of democratic deliberation inevitably gives\nthose with superior argument making abilities and greater willingness\nto participate more influence and therefore more power, than others,\nso equality of political power cannot be intrinsically fair or just\n(Dworkin 2000). In later\nwork, Dworkin has pulled back from this originally thoroughgoing\ninstrumentalism (Dworkin 1996).\n2.2 Non-instrumentalism\n\nFew theorists deny that political institutions must be at least in\npart evaluated in terms of the outcomes of having those institutions.\nSome argue in addition, that some forms of decision making are morally\ndesirable independent of the consequences of having them. A variety of\ndifferent approaches have been used to show that democracy has this\nkind of intrinsic value.\n2.2.1 Liberty\n\nOne prominent justification for democracy appeals to the value of\nliberty. According to one version of the view, democracy is grounded\nin the idea that each ought to be master of his or her life. Each\nperson\u2019s life is deeply affected by the larger social, legal and\ncultural environment in which he or she lives. Only when each person\nhas an equal voice and vote in the process of collective\ndecision-making will each have equal control over this larger\nenvironment. Thinkers such as Carol Gould conclude that only when some\nkind of democracy is implemented, will individuals have a chance at\nself-government (Gould 1988: 45\u201385). Since individuals have a\nright of self-government, they have a right to democratic\nparticipation. The idea is that the right of self-government gives one\na right, within limits, to do wrong. Just as an individual has a right\nto make some bad decisions for himself or herself, so a group of\nindividuals have a right to make bad or unjust decisions for\nthemselves regarding those activities they share.\n\nOne major difficulty with this line of argument is that it appears to\nrequire that the basic rule of decision-making be consensus or\nunanimity. If each person must freely choose the outcomes that bind\nhim or her then those who oppose the decision are not self-governing.\nThey live in an environment imposed on them by others. So only when\nall agree to a decision are they freely adopting the decision (Wolff\n1970: ch. 2). The trouble is that there is rarely agreement on major\nissues in politics. Indeed, it appears that one of the main reasons\nfor having political decision making procedures is that they can\nsettle matters despite disagreement.\n\nOne liberty-based argument that might seem to escape this worry\nappeals to an irreducibly collective right to self-determination. It\nis often argued that political communities have a right as a community\nto organize themselves politically in accordance with their values,\nprinciples, or commitments. Some argue that the right to collective\nself-determination requires democratic institutions that give citizens\ncollective control over their political and legal structure (Cassese\n1995). However, many\nargue democratic institutions are sufficient but not necessary to\nrealize the right to collective self-determination because political\ncommunities might exercise this right to implement non-democratic\ninstitutions (Altman & Wellman 2009; Stilz\n2016).\n2.2.2 Democracy as public justification\n\nAnother non-instrumental justification of democracy appeals to the\nideal of public justification. The idea behind this approach is that\nlaws and policies are legitimate to the extent that they are publicly\njustified to the citizens of the community. Public justification is\njustification to each citizen as a result of free and reasoned debate\namong equals.\n\nJ\u00fcrgen Habermas\u2019s discourse theory of deliberative\ndemocracy has been highly influential in the development of this\napproach. Habermas analyses the form and function of modern legal\nsystems through the lens of his theory of communicative action. This\nanalysis yields the Democratic Principle: \n\n\n[O]nly those statutes may claim legitimacy that can meet with the\nassent of all citizens in a discursive process of legislation that in\nturn has been legally constituted. (Habermas 1992 [1996: 110]) \n\n\nHabermas advances a conception of democratic legitimacy according to\nwhich law is legitimate only if it results from a free and inclusive\ndemocratic process of \u201copinion and will-formation\u201d. What\nmight such a process look like in a complex and differentiated\nsociety? Habermas answers by advancing a \u201ctwo-track\u201d model\nthat understands democratic legitimation in terms of the relationship\nbetween institutionalized deliberative bodies (e.g legislatures,\nagencies, courts) and informal communication in the public sphere,\nwhich is \u201cwild\u201d, and not centrally coordinated.\n\nOne possible objection to this view is that free and inclusive\ndemocratic procedures are insufficient to satisfy the demand for\ndeliberative consensus embodied in the Democratic Principle. This\ndemand is unlikely to be satisfied in diverse societies, since deep\ndisagreements about which laws ought to be enacted is likely to remain\nafter the relevant process of opinion and will-formation. The\nDemocratic Principle might thus be thought to embody an overly\nidealistic conception of democratic legitimacy (Estlund 2008: ch.10).\nAnother possible worry is that the Discourse Principle is not a\ngenuine moral principle, but a principle that embodies the felicity\nconditions of practical discourse. As such, the Discourse Principle\ncannot ground a conception of democratic legitimacy that yields robust\nmoral prescriptions (Forst 2016).\n\nDrawing on Habermas and John Rawls, among others, Joshua Cohen (1996\n[2003]) develops a conception of democracy in which citizens justify\nlaws and policies on the basis of mutually acceptable reasons.\nDemocracy, properly understood, is the context in which individuals\nfreely engage in a process of reasoned discussion and deliberation on\nan equal footing. The ideas of freedom and equality provide guidelines\nfor structuring democratic institutions.\n\nThe aim of Cohen\u2019s conception of democracy as public\njustification is reasoned consensus among citizens. But a serious\nproblem arises when we ask about what happens when disagreement\nremains. Two possible replies have been suggested. It has been urged\nthat forms of consensus weaker than full consensus are sufficient for\npublic justification and that the weaker varieties are achievable in\nmany societies. For instance, there may be consensus on the list of\nreasons that are acceptable publicly but disagreement on the weight of\nthe different reasons. Or there may be agreement on general reasons\nabstractly understood but disagreement about particular\ninterpretations of those reasons. What would have to be shown here is\nthat such weak consensus is achievable in many societies and that the\ndisagreements that remain are not incompatible with the ideal of\npublic justification.\n\nThe basic principle seems to be the principle of reasonableness\naccording to which reasonable persons will only offer principles for\nthe regulation of their society that other reasonable persons can\nreasonably accept. One only offers principles that others, who\nrestrain themselves in the same way, can accept. Such a principle\nimplies a kind of principle of restraint which requires that\nreasonable persons avoid proposing laws and policies on the basis of\ncontroversial moral or philosophical principles. When individuals\noffer proposals for the regulation of their society, they ought not to\nappeal to the whole truth as they see it but only to that part of the\nwhole truth that others can reasonably accept. To put the matter in\nthe way Rawls puts it: political society must be regulated by\nprinciples on which there is an overlapping consensus (Rawls 2005:\nLecture IV). This is meant to obviate the need for a complete\nconsensus on the principles that regulate society.\n\nHowever, it is hard to see how this approach avoids the need for a\ncomplete consensus, which is highly unlikely to occur in any even\nmoderately diverse society. The reason for this is that it is not\nclear why it is any less of an imposition on me when I propose\nlegislation or policies for the society that I must restrain myself to\nconsiderations that other reasonable people accept than it is an\nimposition on others when I attempt to pass legislation on the basis\nof reasons they reasonably reject. For if I do restrain myself in this\nway, then the society I live in will not live up to the standards that\nI believe are essential to evaluating the society. I must then live in\nand support a society that does not accord with my conception of how\nit ought to be organized. It is not clear why this is any less of a\nloss of control over society than for those who must live in a society\nthat is partly regulated by principles they do not accept. If one is a\nproblem, then so is the other, and complete consensus is the only\nsolution (Christiano 2009).\n2.2.3 Equality\n\nMany democratic theorists have argued that democracy is a way of\ntreating persons as equals when there is good reason to impose some\nkind of organization on their shared lives but they disagree about how\nbest to do it. Peter Singer argues that when people insist on\ndifferent ways of arranging matters properly, each person in a sense\nclaims a right to be dictator over their shared lives (Singer 1973:\n30\u201341). But these claims to dictatorship cannot all hold up.\nDemocracy embodies a kind of peaceful and fair compromise among these\nconflicting claims to rule. Each compromises equally on what he claims\nas long as the others do, resulting in each having an equal say over\ndecision making. In effect, democratic decision making respects each\nperson\u2019s point of view on matters of common concern by giving\neach an equal say about what to do in cases of disagreement (Singer\n1973; Waldron 1999: chap. 5).\n\nWhat if people disagree on the democratic method or on the particular\nform democracy is to take? Are we to decide these latter questions by\nmeans of a higher order procedure? And if there is disagreement on the\nhigher order procedure, must we also democratically decide that\nquestion? The view seems to lead to an infinite regress.\n\nAn alternative way of justifying democracy on the basis of equality is\nto ground democracy in public equality. Public equality is a principle\nof equality which ensures that people can see that they are being\ntreated as equals. This view arises from three ideas. First, there is\nthe basic egalitarian idea that people\u2019s interests ought to be\nequally advanced, or at least that they ought to have equal\nopportunities to advance them. Second, human beings generally have\nhighly fallible and biased understandings of their own and other\npeople\u2019s interests. Third, persons have fundamental interests in\nbeing able to see that they are being treated as equals. Public\nequality is an egalitarian principle that can be seen to be realized\namong persons despite the dramatically incomplete forms of knowledge\npeople have. It is not all of justice, but it is essential that the\nprinciple be realized in a pluralistic society. \n\nDemocracy is a uniquely publicly egalitarian way to make collective\ndecisions when there is substantial disagreement and conflict of\ninterest among persons about how to shape the society they share. Each\ncan see that the only plausible way of overcoming persistent\ndisagreement over how to shape the society they all live in, while\nstill publicly treating all persons as equals in the face of bias and\nfallibility, is to give each person an equal say in the process of\nshaping that society. Thus, democracy is necessary to the realization\nof public equality in a political society. Within the framework\ndetermined by this publicly realized equality, persons are permitted\nto attempt to bring about their more particular ideas about justice\nand the common good that they think are right.\n\nThe idea of public equality also grounds limits to democratic decision\nmaking. The thought is that a society cannot democratically decide to\nabolish the democratic rights of some of its members. Public equality\nalso requires that basic liberal and civil rights be respected as\nwell, by the democratic process and so serves as a limit to democratic\ndecision making (Christiano 2008; Valentini 2013).\n\nA number of worries attend this kind of view. First, it is generally\nthought that majority rule is required for treating persons as equals\nin collective decision making. This is because only majority rule is\nneutral towards alternatives in decision making. Unanimity tends to\nfavor the status quo as do various forms of supermajority rule. But if\nthis is so, the above view raises the twin dangers of majority tyranny\nand of persistent minorities, i.e., groups of persons who find\nthemselves always losing in majority decisions. Surely these latter\nphenomena must be incompatible with public equality. Second, the kind\nof view defended above is susceptible to the worry that political\nequality is not a coherent ideal in any modern state with a complex\ndivision of labor and the need for representation. This last worry\nwill be discussed in more detail in the next sections on democratic\ncitizenship and legislative representation. The first worry will be\ndiscussed more in the discussion on the limits to democratic\nauthority.\n\nA related approach grounds democracy in the ideal of relational\nequality. A concern with relational equality is a concern for\n\n\n\nhuman relationships that are, in certain crucial respects at least,\nunstructured by differences of rank, power, or status. (Scheffler\n2010: 225) \n\n\nNiko Kolodny argues that democratic institutions are an essential\ncomponent of relational equality (Kolodny 2014a,b). One line of\nKolodny\u2019s argument holds that political decisions involve the\nuse of coercive force. Inequalities in the power to use force\nundermine equal social status at least in part because the power to\nuse force is \u201cthe power that usually determines the distribution\nof other powers\u201d (Kolodny 2014b: 307). Individuals who have\nsuperior power to use force on others have a superior social status.\nAn egalitarian distribution of political power is thus essential for\nrealizing social equality. And only democratic institutions provide an\negalitarian distribution of political power. We will discuss the\nrelationship between relational equality and democracy further when we\ndiscuss the authority of democracy in Part 3 below.\n3. The Authority of Democracy\n\nSince democracy is a collective decision process, the question\nnaturally arises about whether there is any duty of citizens to obey\ndemocratic decisions when they disagree with it.\n\nThere are three main concepts of the legitimate authority of the\nstate. First, a state has legitimate authority to the extent that it\nis morally justified in coercively imposing its rule on the members.\nLegitimate authority on this account has no direct implications\nconcerning the obligations or duties that citizens may hold toward\nthat state. It simply says that if the state is morally justified in\ndoing what it does, then it has legitimate authority. Second, a state\nhas legitimate authority to the extent that its directives generate\nduties in citizens to obey. The duties of the citizens need not be\nowed to the state but they are real duties to obey. The third is that\nthe state has a right to rule that is correlated with the\ncitizens\u2019 duty to it to obey it. This is the strongest notion of\nauthority and it seems to be the core idea behind the legitimacy of\nthe state. The idea is that when citizens disagree about law and\npolicy it is important to be able to answer the question, who has the\nright to choose?\n3.1 Instrumentalist Conceptions of Democratic Authority\n\nInstrumental arguments for democracy give some reason for why one\nought to respect the democracy when one disagrees with its decisions.\nThere may be many instrumental considerations that play a role in\ndeciding on the question of whether one ought to obey. And these\ninstrumental considerations are pretty much the same whether one is\nconsidering obedience to democracy or some other form of rule.\n\nThere is one instrumentalist approach which is quite unique to\ndemocracy and that seems to ground a strong conception of democratic\nauthority. That is the epistemic approach inspired by the Condorcet\nJury Theorem, which we discussed in\n section 2.1.1.2\n above. There, we discussed a number of difficulties with the\napplication of the Condorcet Jury Theorem to the case of voting in\nelections and referenda in large-scale democracies, including lack of\nindependence, informational segmentation, and the existence of\nideological biases.\n\nOne further worry about the Jury Theorem\u2019s epistemic conceptions\nof authority is that it would prove too much since it undermines the\ncommon practice of the loyal opposition in democracies. If the\nbackground conditions of the Jury Theorem are met, a large-scale\ndemocracy majority is practically certain to produce the right\ndecisions. On what basis can citizens in a political minority\nrationally hold on to their competing views? The members of the\nminority have a powerful reason for shifting their allegiance to the\nmajority position, since each has very good reason to think that the\nmajority is right. The epistemic conception of authority based on the\nJury Theorem thus threatens to be objectionably authoritarian, since\nit looks like it demands not only obedience of action but obedience of\nthought as well. Even in scientific communities the fact that a\nmajority of scientists favor a particular view does not make the\nminority scientists think that they are wrong, though it does perhaps\ngive them pause (Goodin 2003: ch. 7).\n\nSome theories of democratic authority combine instrumental and\nnon-instrumental considerations. David Estlund argues that democratic\nprocedures have legitimate authority because they are better than\nrandom and epistemically the best of the political systems that are\nacceptable to all reasonable citizens (Estlund 2008). They must be better\nthan random because, otherwise, why wouldn\u2019t we use a fair\nrandom procedure like a lottery or coin flip? Democratic authority\nmust have an epistemic element. And the justification of democratic\nprocedure must be acceptable to all reasonable citizens in order to\nrespect their freedom and equality. Estlund\u2019s conception of\ndemocratic authority\u2014which he calls \u201cepistemic\nproceduralism\u201d\u2014 thus combines the ideal of public\njustification with a concern for the tendency of democracies to\nproduce good decisions.\n3.2 Intrinsic Conceptions of Democratic Authority\n3.2.1 Democracy as collective self-rule\n\nSome theorists argue that there is a special relation between\ndemocracy and legitimate authority grounded in the value of collective\nself-rule. John Locke argues that when a person consents to the\ncreation of a political society, they necessarily consent to the use\nof majority rule in deciding how the political society is to be\norganized (Locke 1690: sec. 96). Locke thinks that majority rule is\nthe natural decision rule when there is disagreement. He argues that a\nsociety is a kind of collective body that must move in the direction\nof the greater force. One way to understand this argument is as\nfollows. If we think of each member of society as an equal and if we\nthink that there is likely to be disagreement beyond the question of\nwhether to join society or not, then we must accept majority rule as\nthe appropriate decision rule. This interpretation of the greater\nforce argument assumes that the expression \u201cgreater force\u201d\nis to be understood in terms of the equal worth of each person\u2019s\ninterests and rights, so the society must go in the direction in which\nthe greater number of persons wants it to go.\n\nLocke thinks that a people, which is formed by individuals who consent\nto be members, could choose a monarchy by means of majority rule and\nso this argument by itself does not give us an argument for democracy.\nBut Locke refers back to this argument when he defends the requirement\nof representative institutions for deciding when property may be\nregulated and taxes levied. He argues that a person must consent to\nthe regulation or taxation of his property by the state. But he says\nthat this requirement of consent is satisfied when a majority of the\nrepresentatives of property holders consent to the regulation and\ntaxation of property (Locke, 1690: sec. 140). This does seem to be\nmoving towards a genuinely democratic conception of legitimate\nauthority.\n\nRousseau argues that when individuals consent to form a political\ncommunity, they agree to put themselves under the direction of the\n\u201cgeneral will\u201d (Rousseau 1762). The general will is not a\nmere aggregation of individuals\u2019 private wills. It is, rather,\nthe will of the political community as a whole. And since the general\nwill can only emerge as the product of a properly organized democratic\nprocedure, individuals consent to put themselves under the direction\nof a properly organized democratic procedure. On one interpretation of\nRousseau, democratic procedures are properly organized only when they\n(1) define rights that apply equally to all, (2) via a procedure that\nconsiders everyone\u2019s interests equally, and (3) everyone who is\ncoerced to obey the laws has a voice in that procedure.\n\nThere are at least two ways of understanding the idea of the general\nwill. On what might be called the constitutive\ninterpretation, the general will is constituted by the results of a\nproperly organized democratic procedure. That is, the results of a\nproperly organized democratic procedure are the general will in virtue\nof the fact that they emerge from a properly organized democratic\nprocedure, and not because they reflect some procedure-independent\ntruth about the common good. On what might be called the\nepistemic interpretation, the results of a properly organized\ndemocratic procedure are the way of tracking the procedure-independent\ntruth about the common good. As we discussed in\n section 3.1,\n Rousseau is often interpreted as appealing to Condorcet\u2019s Jury\nTheorem to support the epistemic credentials of a properly organized\ndemocratic procedure.\n3.2.2 Freedom and democratic authority\n\nAnna Stilz develops an account of democratic authority that appeals to\nthe value of \u201cfreedom as independence\u201d (Stilz 2009).\nFreedom as independence is freedom from being subject to the will of\nanother. In order not to be subject to the will of others, individuals\nneed property rights and a protected sphere of autonomy to pursue\none\u2019s plans. Drawing on Kant, Stilz argues that attempts by\nparticular individuals, no matter how conscientious, to define and\nsecure rights to property and autonomy in a state of nature will be\ninconsistent with freedom as independence. Such attempts unilaterally\nimpose new obligations on others through acts of private will in the\nface of competing claims. But even if individuals in a state of nature\ndo agree to a resolution of their competing claims, they are dependent\non the will of others to honor this agreement. Stilz thus argues that\njustice must be administered by an authoritative legal system which\ncan coercively impose one set of objective rules\u2014rules we must\nrespect even when we disagree\u2014to adjudicate our conflicting\nclaims. But if such a system is to be consistent with the freedom of\nsubjects, it cannot be imposed by the private wills of rulers. The\nsolution, Stilz argues, lies in Rousseau\u2019s idea of the general\nwill. When subjects obey the general will, they are not obeying the\nprivate will of any individual; they are obeying a will that arises\nfrom all and applies to all.\n\nOne worry with this account is that those who oppose\ndemocratically-enacted laws or policies can complain that those laws\nor policies are imposed against their will. Perhaps they are not\nsubject to the will of a particular individual, but they are subject\nto the will of a majority. This might be thought to constitute a\nsignificant threat to individuals\u2019 freedom as independence.\nAnother worry, which Stilz\u2019s view arguably inherits from\nRousseau, is that the conditions for the general will to emerge are so\ndemanding that the view implies that no state that exists or has\nexisted has legitimate political authority. Stilz\u2019s view might\nthus be thought to entail what A.J. Simmons calls \u201ca posteriori\nanarchism\u201d (Simmons 2001). \n3.2.3 Equality and authority\n\nAnother approach to democratic authority asserts that failing to obey\nthe decisions of a democratic assembly amounts to treating one\u2019s\nfellow citizens as inferiors (Christiano 2008:\nch. 6). In the face of disagreement about substantive law and policy,\ndemocracy realizes a kind of public equality by giving each individual\nan equal say in determining which laws or policies will be enacted.\nCitizens who skirt laws made by suitably egalitarian procedures act\ncontrary to the equal right of all citizens to have a say in making\nlaws. Those who refuse to pay taxes or respect property laws on the\ngrounds that they are unjust are affirming a superior right to that of\nothers in determining how the shared aspects of social life ought to\nbe arranged. Thus, they violate the duty to treat others publicly as\nequals. And there is reason to think this duty must normally have some\npre-eminence. Public equality is the most important form of equality\nand democracy is required by public equality. The other forms of\nequality in play in substantive disputes about law and policy are ones\nabout which people can have reasonable disagreements (within limits\nspecified by the principle of public equality). Citizens thus have\nobligations to abide by the democratic process even if their favored\nconceptions of justice or equality are passed by in the decision\nmaking process.\n\nDaniel Viehoff develops an egalitarian conception of democratic\nauthority based on the ideal of relational equality (Viehoff 2014; see\n section 2.2.3\n above for more on relational equality). Viehoff argues that\nrelational equality is threatened by \u201csubjection\u201d in a\nrelationship, which occurs when individuals have significantly\ndifferent power over how they interact with and relate to one another.\nAccording to Viehoff, obeying the outcomes of egalitarian democratic\nprocedures is necessary and sufficient for citizens to achieve\ncoordination on common rules without subjection. It is sufficient\nbecause democratic procedures distribute decision-making power\nequally, which ensures that coordination is not determined by unequal\npower advantages. It is necessary because parties must set aside the\nconsiderations of greater and lesser power to realize non-subjection\nin their relationship.\n\nFabienne Peter develops a fairness-based conception of democratic\nauthority that incorporates epistemic considerations (Peter 2008;\n2009). Drawing on insights from proceduralist epistemology,\nPeter\u2019s \u201cpure epistemic proceduralism\u201d holds that\nsuitably egalitarian democratic decisions are binding at least in part\nbecause they result from a fair procedure of knowledge-production.\nThis account differs from Estlund\u2019s epistemic proceduralism (see\n section 5.1\n above) because it does not condition the authority of democratic\nprocedures on their ability to produce decisions that track the\nprocedure-independent truth. Rather, the authority of democratic\nprocedures is grounded in their fairness. And it differs from pure\nprocedural accounts because the relevant notion of fairness is\nfairness in knowledge-production.\n3.3 Limits to the Authority of Democracy\n\nWhat are the limits to democratic authority? A limit to democratic\nauthority is a principle violation of which defeats democratic\nauthority. When the principle is violated by the democratic assembly,\nthe assembly loses its authority in that instance or the moral weight\nof the authority is overridden. A number of different views have been\noffered on this issue. We can distinguish between internal\nand external limits to democratic authority. An internal\nlimit arises from the constitutive requirements of the democratic\nprocess or from the principles that ground democracy. An external\nlimit arises from principles that are independent of the values or\nrequirements that ground democracy.\n\nExternal limits to democratic authority are rebutting limits, which\nare principles that weigh against\u2014and may sometimes outweigh the\nprinciples that ground democracy. So in a particular case, an\nindividual may see that there are reasons to obey the assembly and\nsome reasons against obeying the assembly and in the case at hand the\nreasons against obedience outweigh the reasons in favor of obedience.\nInternal limits to democratic authority are undercutting limits. These\nlimits function not by weighing against the considerations in favor of\nauthority, they undercut the considerations in favor of authority\naltogether; they simply short circuit the authority. When an\nundercutting limit is in play, it is not as if the principles which\nground the limit outweigh the reasons for obeying the democratic\nassembly, it is rather that the reasons for obeying the democratic\nassembly are undermined altogether; they cease to exist or at least\nthey are severely weakened.\n3.3.1 Internal limits to democratic authority\n\nSome have argued that the democratic process ought to be limited to\ndecisions that are not incompatible with the proper functioning of the\ndemocratic process. So they argue that the democratic process may not\nlegitimately take away the political rights of its citizens in good\nstanding. It may not take away rights that are necessary to the\ndemocratic process such as freedom of association or freedom of\nspeech. But these limits do not extend beyond the requirements for\nproper democratic functioning. They do not protect non political\nartistic speech or freedom of association in the case of non political\nactivities (Ely 1980: chap. 4).\n\nAnother kind of internal limit is a limit that arises from the\nprinciples that underpin democracy. And the presence of this limit\nwould seem to be necessary to making sense of the first limit because\nin order for the first limit to be morally important we need to know\nwhy a democracy ought to protect the democratic process.\n\nLocke gives an account of the internal limits of democracy in his idea\nthat there are certain things to which a citizen may not consent\n(Locke 1690: ch. XI). She may not consent to arbitrary rule or the\nviolation of fundamental rights including democratic and liberal\nrights. Since consent is the basis of democratic authority for Locke,\nthis account provides an explanation of the idea behind the first\ninternal limit, that democracy may not be suspended by democratic\nmeans but it goes beyond that limit to suggest that rights that are\nnot essentially connected with the exercise of the franchise may also\nnot be violated because one may not consent to their violation.\n\nMore recently, Ronald Dworkin has defended an account of the limits of\ndemocratic authority (Dworkin 1996). He argues that democracy is\njustified by appeal to a principle of self-government. He argues that\nself-government cannot be realized unless all citizens are treated as\nfull members of the political community, because, otherwise, they are\nnot able to identify as members of the community. Among the conditions\nof full membership, he argues, are rights to be treated as equals and\nrights to have one\u2019s moral independence respected. These\nprinciples support robust requirements of non-discrimination and\nof basic liberal rights. \n\nThe conception of democratic authority that grounds it in public\nequality also provides an account of the limits of that authority\n(Christiano 2008: ch. 6). Since democracy is founded in public\nequality, it may not violate public equality in any of its decisions.\nThe basic idea is that overt violation of public equality by a\ndemocratic assembly undermines the claim that the democratic assembly\nembodies public equality. Democracy\u2019s embodiment of public\nequality is conditional on its protecting public equality. To the\nextent that liberal rights are grounded in public equality and the\nprovision of an economic minimum is also so grounded, this suggests\nthat democratic rights and liberal rights and rights to an economic\nminimum create a limit to democratic authority. This account also\nprovides a deep grounding for the kinds of limits to democratic\nauthority defended in the first internal limit and it goes beyond\nthese to the extent that protection of rights that are not connected\nwith the exercise of the franchise is also necessary to public\nequality.\n3.3.2 The problem of persistent minorities\n\nThis account of the authority of democracy also provides some help\nwith a vexing problem of democratic theory. This problem is the\ndifficulty of persistent minorities. There is a persistent minority in\na democratic society when that minority always loses in the voting.\nThis is always a possibility in democracies because of the use of\nmajority rule. If the society is divided into two or more highly\nunified voting blocks in which the members of each group votes in the\nsame ways as all the other members of that group, then the group in\nthe minority will find itself always on the losing end of the votes.\nThis problem has plagued some societies, particularly those with\nindigenous peoples who live within developed societies. Though this\nproblem is often connected with majority tyranny it is distinct from\nthe problem of majority tyranny because it may be the case that the\nmajority attempts to treat the minority well, in accordance with its\nconception of good treatment. It is just that the minority never\nagrees with the majority on what constitutes proper treatment. Being a\npersistent minority can be highly oppressive even if the majority does\nnot try to act oppressively. This can be understood with the help of\nthe very ideas that underpin democracy. Persons have interests in\nbeing able to correct for the cognitive biases of others and to be\nable to make the world in such a way that it makes sense to them.\nThese interests are set back for a persistent minority since they\nnever get their way.\n\nThe conception of democracy as grounded in public equality can shed\nlight on this problem. It can say that the existence of a persistent\nminority violates public equality (Christiano 2008: chap. 7). In\neffect, a society in which there is a persistent minority is one in\nwhich that minority is being treated publicly as an inferior because\nit is clear that its fundamental interests are being set back. Hence\nto the extent that violations of public equality undercut the\nauthority of a democratic assembly, the existence of a persistent\nminority undermines the authority of the democracy at least with\nrespect to the minority. This suggests that certain institutions ought\nto be constructed so that the minority is not persistent.\n3.3.3 External limits to democratic authority\n\nOne natural kind of limit to democratic authority is the external kind\nof limit. Here the idea is that there are certain considerations that\nfavor democratic decision making and there are certain values that are\nindependent of democracy that may be at issue in democratic decisions.\nFor example, many theories recognize core liberal rights\u2014such as\nrights to property, bodily integrity, and freedom of thought and\nexpression\u2014as external limits to democratic authority. Locke is\noften interpreted as arguing that individuals have natural rights to\nproperty in themselves and the external world that democratic laws\nmust respect in order to have legitimate authority (Locke 1690).\n\nSome views may assert that there are only external limits to\ndemocratic authority. But it is possible to think that there are both\ninternal and external limits. Such an issue may arise in decisions to\ngo to war, for example. In such decisions, one may have a duty to obey\nthe decision of the democratic assembly on the grounds that this is\nhow one treats one\u2019s fellow citizens as equals but one may also\nhave a duty to oppose the war on the grounds that the war is an unjust\naggression against other people. To the extent that this consideration\nis sufficiently serious it may outweigh the considerations of equality\nthat underpin democratic authority. Thus one may have an overall duty\nnot to obey in this context. Issues of foreign policy in general seem\nto give rise to possible external limits to democracy.\n4. The Demands of Democratic Participation\n\nIn this section, we examine the demands of participation in\nlarge-scale democracies. We begin by examining a core challenge to the\nidea that democratic citizens are capable of governing a large and\ncomplex society. We then explore different proposed solutions to the\ncore challenge. Finally, we examine the moral duties of democratic\ncitizens in large-scale democracies in light of the core\nchallenge.\n4.1 The Problem of Democratic Participation\n\nA vexing problem of democratic theory has been to determine whether\nordinary citizens are up to the task of governing a large and complex\nsociety. There are three distinct problems here:\n\n1. First, Plato argued that some people are more intelligent and\ninformed about political matters than others and have a superior moral\ncharacter, and that those persons ought to rule (The\nRepublic, Book VI)\n2. Second, others have argued that a society must have a division\nof labor. If everyone were engaged in the complex and difficult task\nof politics, little time or energy would be left for the other\nessential tasks of a society. Conversely, if we expect most people to\nengage in other difficult and complex tasks, how can we expect them to\nhave the time and resources sufficient to devote themselves\nintelligently to politics?\n3. Third, since individuals have so little impact on the outcomes\nof political decision making in large societies, they have little\nsense of responsibility for the outcomes. Some have argued that it is\nnot rational to vote since the chances that an individual\u2019s vote\nwill a decide the outcome of an election (i.e., will determine whether\na candidate gets elected or not) are nearly indistinguishable from\nzero. For example, one widely accepted estimate puts the odds of an\nindividual casting the deciding vote in a United States presidential\nelection at 1 in 100 million. Many estimates put the odds much lower.\nWorse still, Anthony Downs has argued that almost all of those who do\nvote have little reason to become informed about how best to vote\n(Downs 1957: ch.13). On the assumption that citizens reason and behave\nroughly according to the Downsian model, either the society must in\nfact be run by a relatively small group of people with minimal input\nfrom the rest or it will be very poorly run. As we can see these\ncriticisms are echoes of the sorts of criticisms Plato and Hobbes\nmade.\n\n\nThese observations pose challenges for any robustly egalitarian or\ndeliberative conception of democracy. Without the ability to\nparticipate intelligently in politics one cannot use one\u2019s votes\nto advance one\u2019s aims nor can one be said to participate in a\nprocess of reasoned deliberation among equals. So, either equality of\npolitical power implies a kind of self-defeating equal participation\nof citizens in politics or a reasonable division of labor seems to\nundermine equality of power. And either substantial participation of\ncitizens in public deliberation entails the relative neglect of other\ntasks or the proper functioning of the other sectors of the society\nrequires that most people do not participate intelligently in public\ndeliberation.\n4.2 Proposed Solutions to the Problem of Democratic Participation\n4.2.1 Elite theory of democracy\n\nSome modern theorists of democracy, called elite theorists, have\nargued against any robustly egalitarian or deliberative forms of\ndemocracy in light of the problem of democratic participation. They\nargue that high levels of citizen participation tend to produce bad\nlegislation designed by demagogues to appeal to poorly informed and\noverly emotional citizens. They look upon the alleged uninformedness\nof citizens evidenced in many empirical studies in the 1950s and 1960s\nas perfectly reasonable and predictable. Indeed they regard the\nalleged apathy of citizens in modern states as highly desirable social\nphenomena.\n\nPolitical leaders are to avoid divisive and emotionally charged issues\nand make policy and law with little regard for the fickle and diffuse\ndemands made by ordinary citizens. Citizens participate by voting but\nsince they know very little they are not effectively the ruling part\nof the society. The process of election is usually just a fairly\npeaceful way of maintaining or changing those who rule (Schumpeter\n1942 [1950: 269]).\n\nOn Schumpeter\u2019s view, however, citizens do have a role to play\nin avoiding serious disasters. When politicians act in ways that\nnearly anyone can see is problematic, the citizens can throw the bums\nout.\n\nSo the elite theory of democracy does seem compatible with some of the\ninstrumentalist arguments given above but it is strongly opposed to\nthe intrinsic arguments from liberty, public justification and\nequality. To be sure, there can be an elite deliberative democracy\nwherein elites deliberate, perhaps even out of sight of the population\nat large, on how to run the society.\n\nA view akin to the elite theory but less pessimistic about\ncitizens\u2019 political agency and competence argues that a\nwell-functioning representative democracy can function as a kind of\n\u201cdefensible epistocracy\u201d (Landa & Pevnick 2020). This view holds that, under\nthe right conditions, elected officials can be expected to exercise\npolitical power more responsibly than citizens in a direct democracy\nbecause each official is far more likely to cast the deciding vote in\nlegislative assemblies (the \u201cpivotality effect\u201d) and\nofficials have more incentive to exercise power with due regard for\nthe general welfare (the \u201caccountability effect\u201d).\nMoreover, under the right conditions, representative democracy allows\nindividuals to assess the competence of candidates for office and to\nselect candidates who are best able to help the community pursue its\ncommitments.\n4.2.2 Interest group pluralism\n\nOne approach that is in part motivated by the problem of democratic\ncitizenship but which attempts to preserve some elements of equality\nagainst the elitist criticism is the interest group pluralist account\nof politics. Robert Dahl\u2019s early statement of the view is very\npowerful. \n\n\nIn a rough sense, the essence of all competitive politics is bribery\nof the electorate by politicians\u2026 The farmer\u2026 supports a\ncandidate committed to high price supports, the\nbusinessman\u2026supports an advocate of low corporation\ntaxes\u2026 the consumer\u2026votes for candidates opposed to a\nsales tax. (Dahl 1959: 69) \n\n\nIn this conception of the democratic process, each citizen is a member\nof an interest group with narrowly defined interests that are closely\nconnected to their everyday lives. On these subjects citizens are\nsupposed to be quite well informed and interested in having an\ninfluence. Or at least, elites from each of the interest groups that\nare relatively close in perspective to the ordinary members are the\nprincipal agents in the process. On this account, democracy is not\nrule by the majority but rather rule by coalitions of minorities.\nPolicy and law in a democratic society are decided by means of\nbargaining among the different groups.\n\nThis approach is conceivably compatible with the more egalitarian\napproach to democracy. This is because it attempts to reconcile\nequality with collective decision making by limiting the tasks of\ncitizens to ones which they are able to perform reasonably well. It is\nnot particularly compatible with the deliberative public justification\napproach because it takes the democratic process to be concerned\nessentially with bargaining among the different interest groups where\nthe preferences are not subject to further debate in the society as a\nwhole.\n4.2.3 Neo-liberalism\n\nA third approach inspired by the problem of participation may be\ncalled the neo-liberal approach to politics favored by public choice\ntheorists such as James Buchanan & Gordon Tullock (1962). Against\nelite theories, they contend that elites and their allies will tend to\nexpand the powers of government and bureaucracy for their own\ninterests and that this expansion will occur at the expense of a\nlargely inattentive public. For this reason, they argue for severe\nrestrictions on the powers of elites. They argue against the interest\ngroup pluralist theorists that the problem of participation occurs\nwithin interest groups more or less as much as among the citizenry at\nlarge. Only powerful economic interests are likely to succeed in\norganizing to influence the government and they will do so largely for\ntheir own benefit. Since economic elites will advance their own\ninterests in politics while spreading the costs to others, policies\nwill tend to be more costly (because imposed on everyone in society)\nthan they are beneficial (because they benefit only the elites in the\ninterest group.)\n\nNeo-liberals infer that one ought to transfer many of the current\nfunctions of the state to the market and limit the state to the\nenforcement of basic property rights and liberties. These can be more\neasily understood and brought under the control of ordinary\ncitizens.\n\nBut the neo-liberal account of democracy must answer to two large\nworries. First, citizens in modern societies have more ambitious\nconceptions of social justice and the common good than are realizable\nby the minimal state. The neo-liberal account thus implies a very\nserious curtailment of democracy of its own. More evidence is needed\nto support the contention that these aspirations cannot be achieved by\nthe modern state. Second, the neo-liberal approach ignores the problem\nof large private concentrations of wealth and power that are capable\nof pushing small states around for their own benefit and imposing\ntheir wills on populations without their consent.\n\nSomin (2013) also argues that government be significantly reduced in\nsize so that citizens have a lesser knowledge burden to carry. But he\ncalls for government decentralization so that citizens can vote with\ntheir feet in favor of or against competing units of government, in\neffect creating a kind of market in governments among which citizens\ncan choose.\n4.2.4 The self-interest assumption\n\nA considerable amount of the literature in political science and the\neconomic theory of the state are grounded in the assumption that\nindividuals act primarily and perhaps even exclusively in their\nself-interest narrowly construed. The problem of participation and the\naccounts of the democratic process described above are in large part\ndependent on this assumption. When the preferences of voters are not\nassumed to be self-interested the calculations of the value of\nparticipation change. For example, if a person is a motivated\nutilitarian, the small chance of making a difference is coupled with a\nhuge accumulated return to many people if there is a significant\ndifference between alternatives. It may be worth it in this case to\nbecome reasonably well informed (Parfit 1984: 74). Even more weakly\naltruistic moral preferences could make a big difference to the\nrationality of becoming informed, for example if one had a preference\nto comply with perceived civic duty to vote responsibly (see\n section 4.3.1 for discussion of the duty to\nvote). Any moral preference can be formulated in consistent utility\nfunctions.\n\nMoreover, defenders of deliberative democracy often claim that\nconcerns for the common good and justice are not merely given prior to\npolitics but that they can evolve and improve through the process of\ndiscussion and debate in politics (Elster 1986 [2003]; Gutmann &\nThompson 2004; Cohen 1989 [2009]). They assert that much debate and\ndiscussion in politics would not be intelligible were it not for the\nfact that citizens are willing to engage in open minded discussion\nwith those who have distinct morally informed points of view.\nEmpirical evidence suggests that individuals are motivated by moral\nconsiderations in politics in addition to their interests (Mansbridge\n1990).\n4.2.5 The Division of Democratic Labor\n\nPublic deliberation in any large-scale democracy will occur within a\ncomplex and differentiated \u201cdeliberative system\u201d, a \n\n\nwide variety of institutions, associations, and sites of contestation\naccomplish political work. (Mansbridge et. al. 2012) \n\n\nMoreover, the deliberative system of a complex democracy will be\ncharacterized by a division of democratic labor, with\ndifferent parts of the system making different contributions to the\noverall system. The question arises: what is the appropriate role for\na citizen in this division of labor? Philosophically, we should ask\ntwo questions. What ought citizens have knowledge about in order to\nfulfill their role? What standards ought citizens\u2019 beliefs live\nup to in order to be adequately supported? One promising view is that\ncitizens must think about what ends the society ought to aim at and\nleave the question of how to achieve those aims to experts (Christiano\n1996: ch 5). The rationale for this division of labor is that\nexpertise is not as fundamental to the choice of aims as it is to the\ndevelopment of legislation and policy. Citizens are capable in their\neveryday lives of understanding and cultivating deep understandings of\nvalues and of their interests. And if citizens genuinely do choose the\naims and others faithfully pursue the means to achieving those aims,\nthen citizens are in the driver\u2019s seat in society and they can\nplay this role as equals.\n\nTo be sure, citizens need to know who to vote for and whether those\nthey vote for are genuinely advancing their aims. This would appear to\nrequire some basic knowledge of about how best to achieve their\npolitical aims. How is this possible without extensive knowledge? In\naddition, there is empirical evidence that those who are better\ninformed have more influence on representatives (Erikson 2015). So, if this task requires\nsome kind of knowledge to do well, how can this be compatible with\nequality?\n\nOne promising response is that ordinary citizens do not need\nindividually to have a lot of knowledge of social science and\nparticular facts in order to make political decisions based on such\nknowledge. Recent research in cognitive science indicates the\nindividuals use \u201ccognitive shortcuts\u201d to save on time in\nacquiring information about the world they live in (Lupia &\nMcCubbins 1998). This use of shortcuts is common and essential\nthroughout economic and political life. In political life, we see part\nof the rationale for the many intermediate institutions between\ngovernment and citizens (Downs 1957: 221\u2013229). Citizens save\ntime by making use of institutions such as the press, unions and other\ninterest group associations, political parties, and opinion leaders to\nget information about politics. They also rely on interactions in the\nworkplace as well as conversations with friends and families.\nPolitical parties can connect ordinary citizens in various ways to\nexpertise because each one contains a division of labor within them\nthat mirrors that in the state. Experts in parties have incentives to\nmake their expertise intelligible to other members (Christiano 2012).\nIn addition, under favorable conditions, political parties stimulate\nthe development of citizens\u2019 normative perspectives and\nfacilitate a healthy public competition of political justifications\nbased on those perspectives (White & Ypi 2016).\n\nPeople are dependent on social networks in other ways in a democracy.\nPeople receive \u201cfree\u201d information (which they do not\ndeliberately seek out) about politics and law in school, through their\njobs, in discussion with friends, colleagues and family and\nincidentally through the media. And this can form a better or worse\nbasis on which to pursue other information. Institutions can make a\ndifference to the stream of free information individuals receive.\nEducation can be distributed in a more or less egalitarian way. The\ncircumstances of work can provide more or less free information about\npolitics and law. People who have jobs with a significant amount of\npower such as lawyers, business persons, government officials will be\nbeneficiaries of very high quality free information. They need to know\nabout law and politics to do their jobs properly. Those who hold low\nskilled and non-unionized jobs will receive much less free information\nabout politics at work. To the extent that we can alter the economic\ndivision of labor by for example giving more place to unions or having\ngreater worker participation, we might be able to reduce inequalities\nof information among citizens.\n4.3 The Moral Duties of Democratic Citizens\n\nWhat are the moral duties of democratic citizens in complex\ndemocracies? In this section, we discuss three important democratic\nduties: (1) the duty to vote, (2) the duty to promote justice through\nprincipled disobedience of the law, and (3) duties to accommodate\ndisagreement through compromise and consensus.\n4.3.1 The Duty to Vote\n\nIt is often thought that democratic citizens have a moral duty to vote\nin elections. But this is not obvious. Individual votes are a causally\ninsignificant contribution to the democratic process. In large-scale\ndemocracies, the chance that any particular citizen\u2019s vote will\ndecide the outcome of an election is minuscule. What moral reason do\ndemocratic citizens have to participate in politics even though\nthey\u2019re almost certain not to make the difference to who gets\nelected? Why shouldn\u2019t they seek to promote the good or justice\nin other ways?\n\nParfit develops an act-utilitarian answer to this question (Parfit\n1984: 73\u201375). Act-utilitarians hold that morally right actions\nmaximize the total expected sum of the utilities of all persons in the\nsociety. Parfit argues that voting might nonetheless maximize expected\nutility if one candidate is significantly superior to the other(s). If\nwe add the benefits to each member of the society of having the\nsuperior candidate win, we get a very large difference in value. So\nwhen we multiply that value by the probability of casting the deciding\nvote, which is often thought to be about 1/100,000,000 in a United\nStates presidential election, we might still get a reasonably high\nexpected value. When we subtract the cost to the voter and others of\nvoting, which is often quite low, from this number, we may still have\na good reason to vote. \n\nOne worry with Parfit\u2019s view is that it faces a version of what\nJason Brennan calls \u201cthe particularity problem\u201d (Brennan\n2011). This is the problem of explaining why citizens ought to promote\nvalue through political participation as opposed to through\nnon-political acts. Voting is just one way of promoting overall\nutility; we need to know the expected utility of the different acts\nthey might perform instead. Even if the argument above is correct, it\nmight be the case that many individuals maximize expected utility by\nnot voting and doing something even more beneficial with their\ntime.\n\nAlex Guerrero argues that citizens have moral reasons to vote because\ncandidates who win by a larger proportion of votes can claim a greater\n\u201cnormative mandate\u201d to govern (Guerrero 2010). Still each\nindividual vote makes only a tiny contribution to the proportion of\nvotes a candidate receives. So, we might doubt the strength of the\nreason to vote that Guerrero identifies. \n\nSome theorists argue that individuals have a moral duty to vote in\norder to absolve themselves of complicity in state injustices\n(Beerbohm 2012; Zakaras 2018). All states commit injustices\u2014they\nmake and enforce unjust laws, wage unjust wars, and much else. And\ncitizens of large-scale democracies have a kind of standing\nresponsibility, by paying taxes and obeying laws, for their\nstate\u2019s injustices of which they must actively absolve\nthemselves The complicity account argues that citizens avoid shared\nresponsibility for their state\u2019s injustices if they oppose those\ninjustices through voting and of public advocacy (Beerbohm 2012).\n\nOne worry is that it is unclear why voting and publicly advocating\nagainst injustice should be thought to absolve responsibility that is\nestablished by paying taxes and obeying laws. Another worry is that\none\u2019s concern to oppose injustice should derive from a more\ndirect concern for the wrongs suffered by victims of injustice rather\nthan a concern with keeping one\u2019s hands clean.\n\nOne sort of account that avoids this worry grounds the moral duty to\nvote in the importance of doing one\u2019s fair share of the demands\nof political justice consistent with public equality. The demands of\ncreating and sustaining just institutions distribute fairly among all\ncitizens (Maskivker 2019). If one fails to do one\u2019s fair share\nof these demands, then one fails to show due regard for the eventual\nvictims of injustice. Furthermore, voting provides citizens with a\nmechanism for doing their fair shares of the demands of making their\ninstitutions just in a way that is consistent with respecting the\npublic equality of fellow citizens. By showing up and casting a vote,\ncitizens can contribute to the collective achievement of justice while\nmaintaining equal decision-making power with fellow citizens.\n4.3.2 Principled Disobedience of the Law\n\nCivil disobedience has long been recognized as a central mechanism\nthrough which democratic citizens may legitimately promote political\njustice in their society. According to the standard view, civil\ndisobedience is a public, non-violent and conscientious breach of law\nthat aims to change laws or government policies. People who engage in\ncivil disobedience are willing to accept the legal consequences of\ntheir actions in order to show fidelity to the law (Bedau 1961; Rawls\n1971: ch. 55). The standard definition of civil disobedience has been\nsubjected to challenge. For example, some argue that the private acts\nin which the disobedient seeks to evade legal consequences can count\nas instances of civil disobedience (Raz 1979; Brownlee 2004, 2007,\n2012).\n\nPerhaps the most common way of justifying civil disobedience argues\nthat the same considerations that ground the pro tanto duty\nto obey the law sometimes make it appropriate to engage in civil\ndisobedience of the law (see, e.g., Rawls 1971: ch. 57; Sabl 2001;\nMarkovits 2005; Smith 2011). For example, Rawls argues that while\ncitizens of a \u201cnearly just\u201d society have a pro\ntanto duty to obey its laws in virtue of it being nearly just,\ncivil disobedience can be justified as a way of making the relevant\nsociety more just (Rawls 1971: ch. 57). Similarly, Daniel Markovits\nargues that members of a society with suitably egalitarian and\ninclusive democratic procedures have a general duty to obey its laws\nbecause they are produced by procedures that are suitably egalitarian\nand inclusive, but that civil disobedience can be justified as a way\nof making the relevant procedures more egalitarian or inclusive\n(Markovits 2005).\n\nIt is easy to see why this constitutes an attractive way of justifying\ncivil disobedience, since it justifies it by appeal to the same values\nthat ground the pro tanto duty to obey the law. On the other\nhand, as Simmons notes, if there is no general duty to obey the law,\nthere would seem to be no presumption in favor of obedience and thus\nno special need for a justification of civil disobedience; obedience\nand disobedience would stand equally in need of justification (Simmons\n2007: ch 4).\n\nAdvocates of the standard approach generally assume that only\ncivil disobedience can be justified in this way. However,\nsome argue civil disobedience does not enjoy a special normative\npresumption over uncivil disobedience. The core idea that\ninsofar as the values that ground a pro tanto duty to obey\nthe law\u2014for example, justice or democratic equality\u2014are\nsometimes best served by civil disobedience of the law, they are\nsometimes best served by covert, evasive, anonymous, or even violent\ndisobedience of the law (Delmas 2018; Lai 2019; Pasternak 2018).\n4.3.3 Accommodate Disagreement Through Compromise and Consensus\n\nDisagreement about what laws, policies, or principles ought to be\nimplemented is a persistent feature of democratic societies. It is\noften argued that citizens and officials have duties to moderate their\npolitical activity in order to accommodate the competing views of\nfellow citizens or officials. Two duties of accommodation are widely\ndiscussed in the literature: duties of compromise and duties of public\njustification.\n\nA compromise can be understood as an agreement between parties to\nadvance laws or policies that all regard as suboptimal because they\ndisagree about which laws or policies are optimal (May 2005). While it\nis widely accepted that there are sometimes compelling instrumental\nreasons to compromise, whether there are intrinsic moral reasons to\ncompromise is more controversial. Some defend intrinsic reasons to\ncompromise based on democratic values like inclusion, mutual respect,\nand reciprocity (Gutmann and Thompson 2014; Wendt 2016; Weinstock\n2013). However, Simon May argues that such arguments fail and that all\nreasons to compromise are pragmatic (May 2005).\n\nAdvocates of the public justification approach to democracy (see\nsection 2.2.2) often argue that democratic\ncitizens and officials have\nindividual moral duties of public justification. John Rawls argues for\na \u201cduty of civility\u201d that requires citizens and officials\nto be prepared to give mutually acceptable justifications for\nimportant laws when voting and engaged in public advocacy. Given the\ninevitability of disagreement about comprehensive moral and\nphilosophical truth in free democracies, the duty of civility requires\ncitizens to appeal to a reasonable \u201cpolitical\u201d conception\nof justice that can be the object of an \u201coverlapping\nconsensus\u201d between different comprehensive doctrines. While\ndifferent theorists motivate duties of public justification in\ndifferent ways, many appeal to the need for exercises of coercive\npolitical authority to respect citizens\u2019 freedom and\nequality.\n5. Democratic Representation\n\nRepresentation is an essential part of the division of labor of\nlarge-scale democracies. In this section, we examine two moral\nquestions concerning representation. First, what sort of\nrepresentative system is best? Second, by what moral principles are\nrepresentatives bound?\n5.1 What Sort of Representative System is Best?\n\nA number of debates have centered on the question of what kinds of\nrepresentative systems are best for a democratic society. What choice\nwe make here will depend heavily on our underlying moral justification\nof democracy, our conception of citizenship as well as on our\nempirical understanding of political institutions and how they\nfunction. The most basic types of formal political representation\navailable are single member district representation, proportional\nrepresentation and group representation. In addition, many societies\nhave opted for multicameral legislative institutions. In some cases,\ncombinations of the above forms have been tried.\n\nSingle member district representation returns single representatives\nof geographically defined areas containing roughly equal populations\nto the legislature and is prominent in the United States, the United\nKingdom, and India, among other places. The most common form of\nproportional representation is party list proportional representation.\nIn a simple form of such a scheme, a number of parties compete for\nelection to a legislature that is not divided into geographical\ndistricts. Parties acquire seats in the legislature as a proportion of\nthe total number of votes they receive in the voting population as a\nwhole. Group representation occurs when the society is divided into\nnon-geographically defined groups such as ethnic or linguistic groups\nor even functional groups such as workers, farmers and capitalists and\nreturns representatives to a legislature from each of them.\n\nMany have argued in favor of single member district legislation on the\ngrounds that it has appeared to them to lead to more stable government\nthan other forms of representation. The thought is that proportional\nrepresentation tends to fragment the citizenry into opposing\nhomogeneous camps that rigidly adhere to their party lines and that\nare continually vying for control over the government. Since there are\nmany parties and they are unwilling to compromise with each other,\ngovernments formed from coalitions of parties tend to fall apart\nrather quickly. The post war experience of governments in Italy\nappears to confirm this hypothesis. Single member district\nrepresentation, in contrast, is said to enhance the stability of\ngovernments by virtue of its favoring a two party system of\ngovernment. Each election cycle then determines which party is to stay\nin power for some length of time.\n\nCharles Beitz argues that single member district representation\nencourages moderation in party programs offered for citizens to\nconsider (Beitz 1989: ch. 7). This results from the tendency of this\nkind of representation towards two party systems. In a two party\nsystem with majority rule, it is argued, each party must appeal to the\nmedian voter in the political spectrum. Hence, they must moderate\ntheir programs to appeal to the median voter. Furthermore, they\nencourage compromise among groups since they must try to appeal to a\nlot of other groups in order to become part of one of the two leading\nparties. These tendencies encourage moderation and compromise in\ncitizens to the extent that political parties, and interest groups,\nhold these qualities up as necessary to functioning well in a\ndemocracy.\n\nIn criticism, advocates of proportional and group representation have\nargued that single member district representation tends to muffle the\nvoices and ignore the interests of minority groups in the society\n(Mill 1861; Christiano 1996). Minority interests and views tend to be\narticulated in background negotiations and in ways that muffle their\ndistinctiveness. Furthermore, representatives of minority interests\nand views often have a difficult time getting elected at all in single\nmember district systems so it has been charged that minority views and\ninterests are often systematically underrepresented. Sometimes these\nproblems are dealt with by redrawing the boundaries of districts in a\nway that ensures greater minority representation. The efforts are\ninvariably quite controversial since there is considerable\ndisagreement about the criteria for apportionment.\n\nIn proportional representation, by contrast, representatives of\ndifferent groups are seated in the legislature in proportion to\ncitizens\u2019 choices. Minorities need not make their demands\nconform to the basic dichotomy of views and interests that\ncharacterize single member district systems so their views are more\narticulated and distinctive as well as better represented.\n\nAdvocates of group representation, like Iris Marion Young, have argued\nthat some historically disenfranchised groups may still not do very\nwell under proportional representation (Young 1990: ch. 6). They may\nnot be able to organize and articulate their views as easily as other\ngroups. Also, minority groups can still be systematically defeated in\nthe legislature and their interests may be consistently set back even\nif they do have some representation. For these groups, some have\nargued that the only way to protect their interests is legally to\nensure that they have adequate and even disproportionate\nrepresentation.\n\nOne worry about group representation is that it tends to freeze some\naspects of the agenda that might be better left to the choice of\ncitizens. For instance, consider a population that is divided into\nlinguistic groups for a long time. And suppose that only some citizens\ncontinue to think of linguistic conflict as important. In the\ncircumstances a group representation scheme may tend to be biased in\nan arbitrary way that favors the views or interests of those who do\nthink of linguistic conflict as important.\n5.2 The Ethics of Representation\n\nWhat moral norms apply to representatives carrying out their official\nduties? We can get a better handle on possible answers by introducing\nHannah Pitkin\u2019s famous distinction between trustees and\ndelegates (Pitkin 1967). Representatives who act as trustees\nrely on their own independent judgments in carrying out their duties.\nNorms of trusteeship are supported in recognition that, given a\nnatural division of democratic labor, officials are in a much better\nposition to make well-reasoned and well-informed political decisions\nthan ordinary citizens.\n\nRepresentatives who act as delegates defer to the judgments of their\ncitizens. These norms might be thought to reflect the value of\ndemocratic accountability. Because the people authorize\nrepresentatives to govern, it is natural to think that representatives\nare accountable to the people to enact their judgments. If\nrepresentatives are not accountable in this way, citizens lose\ndemocratic control over their representatives\u2019 actions.\n\nWhich norms should win out when they conflict? Pitkin argues that the\nanswer varies by context. This seems plausible. For example, if we\ntake the view that citizens primarily have the role of determining the\naims of the society, we might think that representatives ought to be\ndelegates with regard to the aims, but trustees with regard to the\nways of realizing the aims (Christiano 1996). See Suzanne Dovi\u2019s\ndiscussion of representation for a deeper and more nuanced discussion\nof these issues.\n6. Social Choice and Democracy\n\nKenneth Arrow\u2019s impossibility theorem is thought by some to\nprovide a major set of difficulties for democratic theory (Arrow\n1951). William Riker, Russell Hardin, and others have thought that the\nimpossibility theorem shows that there are deep problems with\ndemocratic ideals (Riker 1982; Hardin 1999). Neither of these thinkers\nare opposed to democracy itself, they both think that there are good\ninstrumental reasons for having democracy. \n\nThe basic results of social choice theory are laid out in detail\nelsewhere in the encyclopedia (List 2013). Here we will simply\narticulate the basic result and an illustration. The question of\nArrowian social choice theory is: how do we determine a social\npreference for a society overall on the basis of the set of the\nindividual preferences of the members? Arrow shows that a social\nchoice function that satisfies a number of plausible constraints\ncannot be defined when there are three or more alternatives to be\nchosen by the group. He lays out a number of conditions to be imposed\non a social choice function. Unlimited domain: The social\nchoice function must be able to give us a social preference no matter\nwhat the preferences of the individuals over alternatives are. Non\ndictatorship: the social choice function must not select the\npreference of one particular member regardless of others\u2019\npreferences. Transitivity and completeness: The individual\npreferences orderings must be transitive and complete orderings and\nthe social preference derived from them must be transitive and\ncomplete. Independence of irrelevant alternatives: the social\npreference between two alternatives must be the result only of the\nindividual orderings between those two alternatives. Pareto\ncondition: if all the members prefer an alternative x over\ny, then x must be ranked above y in the social\npreference. The theorem says that no social choice function over more\nthan two alternatives can satisfy all of these conditions.\n\nA useful illustration of this idea involves an extension of majority\nrule to cases of more than two alternatives. The Condorcet rule says\nthat an alternative x wins when, for every other alternative, a\nmajority prefers x over that alternative. For example, suppose\nwe have three persons A, B and C and three\nalternatives x, y and z. A prefers\nx over y, y over z; B prefers\ny over z and z over x; C prefers\nx over z and z over y. In this case,\nx is the Condorcet winner since it beats y, and it beats\nz. The problem with this plausible sounding rule is the case of\na majority cycle. Suppose you have three persons A, B\nand C, and three alternatives, x, y and z.\nIn the case in which A prefers x over y and y\nover z, while B prefers y over z and\nz over x, and C prefers z over x\nand x over y, the Condorcet rule will yield a social\npreference of x over y, y over z and\nz over x. One can see here that the Condorcet rule\nsatisfies all the conditions except transitivity of social preference.\nOne way to avoid intransitivity is to restrict the domain of\npreferences from which the social preference arises. Another is to\nintroduce cardinal information that compares the how much people\nprefer alternatives (violating independence). Another might be to make\none person a dictator. So, this case nicely illustrates that one\ncannot satisfy all of the constraints simultaneously.\n\nRiker argues that the theorem shows that the idea that the popular\nwill can be the governing element in a society is false. If an\nexistence condition for a popular will is a restricted set of\npreferences the question naturally arises as to whether such a\ncondition is always or normally met in a moderately complex society.\nWe might wonder whether a highly pluralistic society with a very\ncomplex division of labor is likely to satisfy the restricted\npreference set condition necessary to avoid cycles or other\npathologies of social choice. Some have argued that we have empirical\nevidence to the effect that modern societies do normally satisfy such\nconditions (Mackie 2003). Others have argued that this seems unlikely\n(Riker 1982; Ingham 2019). This is not merely a defense of unlimited\ndomain. It is a defense of the thesis that normally the collections of\npreferences in modern societies are not likely to have the properties\nthat enable them to avoid cycles.\n\nThe fairness critique from social choice theory is based on the idea\nthat when a voting process meets requirements of fairness, the\nfairness of the process and the preferences may not generate\ndeterminate outcomes. If cycles are pervasive, the outcomes of\ndemocratic processes may be determined by clever strategies and not by\nthe fairness of the procedures (Riker 1982). Three remarks are in\norder here. First, it is compatible with the process being completely\nfair that the outcomes of the process are indeterminate. After all,\ncoin flips are fair. Second, there is some question as to how\nprominent the cycles are. Third, one might think that if the\nconditions which enable opposing sides to strategize effectively are\nthemselves roughly equal, then the concerns for fairness are fully\nmet. If resources for persuasion and organization are distributed in\nan egalitarian way, perhaps the fairness account is vindicated after\nall. This point can be made more compelling when we consider Sean\nIngham\u2019s account of political equality. He includes intensity of\npreference in his account of fairness. This is a departure from the\nArrowian approach, but it is in many ways a realistic one. The idea is\nthat majorities have equal control over policy areas when they are\nable to get what they want with the same amount of intensity of\npreferences. And equality holds generally when all groups of the same\nsize have the same control (Ingham 2019). There remains an extreme\ncase in which all majorities have equal intensity of preference and\nare caught in a majority cycle. But the chances of this happening are\nvery slim, even if the chances of majority cycles more generally are\nnot as small. Even if there are a lot of majority cycles, if the\nissues are resolved in such a way that those majorities that have most\nat stake in the conflict are the ones that get their way, then we can\nhave fairness in a quite robust sense even while having pervasive\nmajority cycles. \n7. The Boundary Problem: Constituting the Demos\n\nIf democratic societies allow members to participate as equals in\ncollective decision making, a natural question arises: who has the\nright to participate in making collective decisions? We can ask this\nquestion within a particular jurisdiction (ought all adults have the\nright to participation? Ought children have the right to\nparticipation? Ought all residents have such rights?). But we can also\nask what the extent of the jurisdiction ought to be. How many of the\npeople in the world ought to be included in the collective\ndecision-making? An easy, though slightly misleading, way of asking\nthis question is, what ought the physical boundaries of a particular\ninstitution of collective decision-making be? We see partially\ndemocratic societies within the confines of the modern nation-state.\nBut we might ask, why should we restrict the set of persons who\nparticipate in making decisions of the modern state just to those who\nhappen to be the physical inhabitants of those states? Surely there\nare many other persons affected by decisions made by democratic states\naside from those persons. For example, activities in one society\nA can pollute another society B. Why shouldn\u2019t the\nmembers of B have a say in the decisions regarding the\npolluting activities in A? And there can be many other effects\nthat activities in A can have on B.\n\nSome have suggested that the boundaries of a state ought to be\ndetermined through a principle of national self-determination. We\nidentify a nation as an ongoing group of persons who share certain\ncultural, historical and political norms and who identify with each\nother and with a piece of land. Then we determine the boundaries of\nthe territory by appeal to the size of the group of people and the\nland they cherish (Miller 1995; Song 2012). This is an appealing idea\nin many ways: shared nationality breeds a willingness to share the\nsacrifices that arise from collective decision making; it generates a\nsense of at-homeness for people. But it is hard to use as a general\nprinciple for dividing land among persons when one of the central\nfacts for many societies is that a diversity of nations, ethnic groups\nand cultures co-mingle on the very same land. \n\nIs there a democratic solution to the boundary problem? A number of\nideas have been suggested. The first idea is that the people ought to\ndecide what the boundaries are. But this suggestion, while it may be a\npragmatic resolution to the problem, seems to beg the question about\nwho the members are and who are not (Whelan 1983).\n\nA second theoretical solution that has some democratic credentials is\nto invoke the principle that all who are subjected to decision making,\nin the sense of who are coerced or have duties imposed upon them,\nought to have a say in the decision making (Abizadeh 2008). This\nprinciple is plausible enough, but it doesn\u2019t get at enough\ncases. The pollution case above is not a case of subjection.\n\nA third proposed theoretical solution is the all-affected principle.\nOne formulation is \u201call affected persons ought to have a say in\nthe decisions that affect them\u201d. This does suggest that when the\nactivities in one state affect those of another state, the people of\nthe other state ought to have a say in those activities. Some have\nthought that this principle tends to lead to a kind of politically\ncosmopolitan principle in support of world government (Goodin 2007).\n\n\nBut the all-affected principle is conceptually quite uncertain and\nmorally deeply problematic, and it provides very little, if anything,\nin the way of a solution to the boundary problem. \n\nFirst, \u201chaving a say\u201d is not clear. Does it require having\na vote in collective decision-making? Or is it also satisfied by a\nperson\u2019s being able to modify another\u2019s action by\nnegotiating with them, as we see when there is bargaining over an\nexternality? This latter version would undermine the idea that the\nall-affected principle has direct implications for the boundary\nproblem. When the United States permits activities that produce acid\nrain in Canada, Canada can negotiate with the United States to lessen\nthe production of acid rain and/or to compensate Canada for the harm.\nAs long as there is a fair and effective system of negotiation, this\nwould seem to satisfy the all-affected principle without giving\nCanadians a vote in American politics or Americans a vote in Canadian\npolitics.\n\nSecond, it is not clear what \u201cbeing affected\u201d means. One,\ndoes a person being affected just mean that there is a change in the\nperson\u2019s situation or must the effect involve the setting back\nof one\u2019s preferences, or interests, or legitimate interests, or\nexercise of one\u2019s capacities or one\u2019s good? Two, are\none\u2019s interests affected by a decision only when they are\nadvanced or set back relative to some baseline (either the present\nstate of affairs or some morally defined baseline like what you have\npromised me), or am I affected by decisions that could be to my\nadvantage or disadvantage but end up making no difference? For\nexample, if I am drowning in a pool and you are deciding whether to\nsave me or go buy yourself a candy bar, am I affected by your buying\nthe candy bar? If I am not affected when no change occurs, then who is\naffected by a decision often depends on who participates in the\ndecision and we have no solution to the problem of inclusion. If I am\naffected, then the principle has some quite extraordinary\nimplications. Now it turns out that impoverished persons in South Asia\nare affected by my buying a candy bar, since I could have sent the\nmoney to them (Goodin 2007).\n\nThe all-affected principle is a merely suggestive and rhetorically\neffective phrase. It is a conversation starter and a list of topics to\nbe discussed, not a genuine principle. For example, if I must include\neveryone possibly affected by my decision for every decision I make, I\nwill not be able to make many decisions and my decision making will no\nlonger enable me to give a shape to my own life and my relations with\nothers. My life becomes fragmented and lacks integrity (Williams\n1973). An analog of this problem would arise for political societies,\npresumably. Each society would have to include a variety of different\npersons in each decision. It is hard to see how any society could take\non any particular character if this is the case. \n\nA more plausible principle that encompasses some of the suggestions of\nthe all-affected principle is that a framework of institutions should\nbe set up so that people have power to advance and protect their\nlegitimate interests in life. \n\nBut if we understand the principle in this way, it is not clear that\nit helps us much with the boundary problem. First of all, there are\ndifferent ways in which people can be said to possess power over their\nlives. One kind of power is the power to participate as an equal in a\ncollective decision-making process. Another kind is to be able to\nadvance one\u2019s interests in a decentralized process like a market\nor a system of agreement making like international law. Recalling our\npollution problem above, we could give the state of which they are\nmembers power to negotiate with the polluting state terms that are\nmutually agreeable. Only the power to participate as an equal in\ncollective decision-making involves the boundaries of collective\ndecision-making. \n\nAnother solution to the boundary problem is a conservative one. The\nbasic idea is to keep the boundaries of states roughly as they are\nexcept if there is a pressing need to change them. Trying to alter the\nboundaries of political societies is a recipe for serious conflict\nbecause there is no institution that has the legitimacy or power\nactually to resolve problems at an international level and there is\nlikely to be a lot of disagreement on how to do it. States as we know\nthem, are by far the most powerful political entities in the\ninternational system. They have developed more effective practices of\naccountability of power than any other entity in the system. They have\ncreated unified societies with highly interdependent populations.\nFinally, states and the individuals in them can be made accountable to\nsome degree to other individuals and states through the process of\nnegotiation and international law making. The origin of these\nboundaries may be arbitrary, but it is not, for all that, irrelevant.\nTo be sure, there are clear cases where borders can be changed. One\nsource of pressing need is serious injustice within a country. Another\nmight be the existence of permanent minorities that are sectionally\ndefined. Here, we ask only how to revise boundaries and the basis of\nsuch revision is that it is a remedy for serious injustice (Buchanan\n1991).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Abizadeh, Arash, 2008, \u201cDemocratic Theory and Border\nCoercion: No Right to Unilaterally Control Your Own Borders\u201d,\n<em>Political Theory</em>, 36(1): 37\u201365.\ndoi:10.1177/0090591707310090", "Acemoglu, Daron, Suresh Naidu, Pascual Restrepo, and James A.\nRobinson, 2019, \u201cDemocracy Does Cause Growth\u201d, <em>Journal\nof Political Economy</em>, 127(1): 47\u2013100.\ndoi:10.1086/700936", "Achen, Christopher H. and Larry M.
