Cohen 1988: 3). The canonical text for this\ninterpretation being Marx\u2019s \u201c1859 Preface\u201d to A\nContribution to the Critique of Political Economy, which is\ntreated not as one piece of evidence amongst many, but as the text\nproviding the clearest theoretical statement of historical\nmaterialism.\n\nCohen presents Marx as committed to the following claims, amongst\nothers:\n\nFirst, the Development Thesis: which claims that the productive\nforces have an autonomous tendency to develop throughout history. The\nproductive forces are those facilities and devices\u2014means of\nproduction (including tools, raw materials, and premisses) and labour\npower (including strength, skill, and technical knowledge)\u2014used\nto productive effect in the process of production. Growth here can be\nmeasured by the decreasing amount of labour it takes with given forces\nto produce what is necessary to satisfy the basic physical needs of\nthe immediate producers.\nSecond, the First Primacy Thesis: which claims that the level of\ndevelopment of the productive forces in a given society explains the\neconomic structure (the set of relations of production) that obtain in\nthat society. The relations of production\u2014the sum total of which\nare said to constitute the economic structure (or \u201cbase\u201d)\nof a given society\u2014are the relations of power that people enjoy,\nor lack, over the productive forces, over means of production and\nlabour power (G. Cohen 1988: 4).\nThird, the Second Primacy Thesis: which claims that the\n\u201cbase\u201d, understood as the economic structure of a given\nsociety, explains the legal and political \u201csuperstructure\u201d\nin that society. \nFourth, the claim that the kind of explanation involved in both of\nthese two Primacy Theses is functional explanation (see\n section 3.3).\n\n\nTo put a little flesh on those abstract bones, consider the following\nelaboration of the First Primacy Thesis (Wright, Levine, & Sober\n1992: 19). A given level of development of the productive forces is\nonly compatible with a certain type (or with limited types) of\neconomic structure. Since forces of production tend to develop over\ntime (see the \u201cDevelopment Thesis\u201d), the forces eventually\nreach a level where they are no longer compatible with the relations\nof production under which they had previously developed. When such\nincompatibilities arise, the relations are said to\n\u201cfetter\u201d the development of the forces of production (G.\nCohen 1988: 109\u2013123). This fettering leads to revolution, in\nwhich social actors (classes) with the capacity to bring new relations\ninto effect emerge, and revolutionise the economic structure in ways\nthat restores growth in the productive forces.\n\nThis model of growing levels of productive power, and their associated\nforms of society, is said to generate a four-stage periodisation of\nprogressive epochs in human history (G. Cohen 1978: 197\u2013201). In\nthe first stage, the material position involves an absence of surplus,\nand the corresponding social form is a primitive classless society\n(productive power being too low to enable a class of non-producers to\nlive off the labour of producers). In the second stage, the material\nposition is a surplus large enough to support an exploiting class, but\ntoo small to sustain capitalist accumulation, and the corresponding\nsocial form is a pre-capitalist class society. In the third stage, the\nmaterial surplus is moderately high\u2014high enough to support\ncapitalist accumulation\u2014and the corresponding social form is\ncapitalist class society. Capitalism subsequently generates a growing\nsurplus such that it becomes itself unsustainable (for contested\nreasons), leading to a fourth and final stage, where, on the basis of\na precondition of a massive surplus, a modern classless society\nemerges.\n\nSuch an abbreviated summary ignores many interesting complexities and\nchanges in Cohen\u2019s views, but hopefully give some sense of its\ncharacter as a defence of a \u201ctraditional\u201d, even\n\u201cold-fashioned\u201d, conception of historical materialism\nattaching explanatory primacy to the forces of production (G. Cohen\n1978: x).\n\nThere is a huge critical literature on Cohen\u2019s reading of\nMarx\u2019s theory of history. A thorough survey is scarcely possible\nhere, but most criticisms tend to cluster around three main kinds of\nconcern.\n\nFirst, there are criticisms based on Cohen\u2019s treatment of what\nmight be called textual issues. For example, there is some\nsuspicion of what is seen as his over-reliance on the\n\u201c1859 Preface\u201d (critics sometimes utilising Printz\n1969). Or, to give another example, there are appeals to the lack of\nfit between Cohen\u2019s interpretation and some of the more concrete\naccounts of historical development found elsewhere in Marx\u2019s own\nwritings (Miller 1984: 188\u2013195).\n\nSecond, there are criticisms pressing on coherence issues arising from\nCohen\u2019s reconstruction of Marx\u2019s theory. For example,\nthere is some scepticism about whether the \u201cbase\u201d can be\ndistinguished from the \u201csuperstructure\u201d in the way that he\nrequires (F. Cohen & Acton 1970; Lukes 1982). Or, to give another\nexample, whether Cohen\u2019s distinction between social and material\nproperties is conceptually flawed in ways that undermine his claims\nabout the primacy of the productive forces (Coram 1989).\n\nThird, there are criticisms examining the empirical truth of\nthis account of Marx\u2019s theory. For example, there are doubts\nabout whether the historical record of pre-capitalist\nsocieties\u2014especially given cases such as the \u201clong\nperiod\u201d in Chinese history, or the \u201csecond serfdom\u201d\nin Poland\u2014offer support for the claim that there is little\nproductive regression in history (J. Cohen 1982: 266\u2013268). In\naddition, some historians are sceptical of whether, given\npre-capitalist relations, economic actors have the relevant incentives\nto act in the ways\u2014especially, in transforming property\nrelations\u2014that Cohen\u2019s theory seems to require (Brenner\n1985a, 1985b, and 1986). Or, to give a final empirical example, as\npart of a wider insistence that Cohen\u2019s early work is flawed by\nits lack of gender awareness, Paula Casal argues that his four-stage\nperiodisation of epochs (and associated producers) cannot survive\nserious reflection on the economic position of women (2020).\n\nThese, and many other, critical questions are not pursued further\nhere. Instead, the remainder of the section considers the explanatory\nscope of historical materialism.\n\nCohen accepts that Marx\u2019s theory makes some large and\ncontroversial claims, but comes to think that these may be less\ndemanding than is often thought. Cohen distinguishes two\ninterpretations of historical materialism. On an inclusive\nreading, the theory claims that material and economic developments\nexplain the principal features of other, non-economic developments.\nHowever, on a restricted reading, the theory commits itself\nto explaining non-economic phenomena only when, if they weren\u2019t\nso explained, they would seem to control material development. The\ntheory, on this \u201crestricted\u201d reading, limits itself to\nexplaining non-economic phenomena which possess \u201ceconomic\nrelevance\u201d (G. Cohen 1988: 173). It seems likely that Marx and\nEngels\u2014perhaps under the influence of Hegel\u2019s philosophy\nof history\u2014assumed an inclusive reading, but Cohen suggests that\nthe restricted reading is consistent with the \u201c1859\nPreface\u201d, and may offer a better fit with historical\nevidence.\n\nAn example can illuminate the difference between these two readings\n(G. Cohen 1988: 160\u2013165). Assume that the following increasingly\nWeberian-looking claims are all true: first, that Protestantism took\nhold and persisted for non-economic reasons; second, that\nProtestantism had important consequences for European religious life;\nand, third, that Protestantism had important consequence for European\neconomic life. Note that inclusive historical materialism is\nchallenged by both the conjunction of the first two claims, and the\nthird claim; whereas restricted historical materialism is challenged\nonly by the addition of the third claim to the first two. Moreover, on\nCohen\u2019s functionalist account, the latter can meet that\nchallenge: \n\n\nif the features of Protestantism in virtue of which it had economic\neffects arose because of their tendency to have such effects. (1988:\n176)\n\n\nCohen was subsequently persuaded (by Wright) that this distinction\nbetween restricted and inclusive historical materialism is\nbetter understood in the light of a \u201cprior\ndistinction\u201d between Marxist theory of history and Marxist\nsociology (G. Cohen 1988: 176\u2013177). Marxist theory of history is\nidentified with the restricted variant, and the familiar Marxist\nclaims that the latter refrained from affirming (about the economic\nexplaining the principal features of non-economic life) are now\nallocated to Marxist sociology. Where Marxist theory of history is\nconcerned with the issue of how social formations succeed one another,\nMarxist sociology is concerned with how the elements within a social\nformation are related. The latter, but not the former, insists that\nnon-economic structures and modes of consciousness are, in their broad\noutlines, explained by material and economic factors. The two theories\nare often conflated, but they are sufficiently distinct that they\nrequire independent assessment (G. Cohen 1988: 178).\n",
