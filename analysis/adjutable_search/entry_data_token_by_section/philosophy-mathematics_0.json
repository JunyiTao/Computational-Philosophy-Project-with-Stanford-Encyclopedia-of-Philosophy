Philosophy of Mathematics, Logic, and the Foundations of Mathematics\n\nOn the one hand, philosophy of mathematics is concerned with problems\nthat are closely related to central problems of metaphysics and\nepistemology. At first blush, mathematics appears to study abstract\nentities. This makes one wonder what the nature of mathematical\nentities consists in and how we can have knowledge of mathematical\nentities. If these problems are regarded as intractable, then one\nmight try to see if mathematical objects can somehow belong to the\nconcrete world after all.\n\nOn the other hand, it has turned out that to some extent it is\npossible to bring mathematical methods to bear on philosophical\nquestions concerning mathematics. The setting in which this has been\ndone is that of mathematical logic when it is broadly\nconceived as comprising proof theory, model theory, set theory, and\ncomputability theory as subfields. Thus the twentieth century has\nwitnessed the mathematical investigation of the consequences of what\nare at bottom philosophical theories concerning the nature of\nmathematics.\n\nWhen professional mathematicians are concerned with the foundations of\ntheir subject, they are said to be engaged in foundational research.\nWhen professional philosophers investigate philosophical questions\nconcerning mathematics, they are said to contribute to the philosophy\nof mathematics. Of course the distinction between the philosophy of\nmathematics and the foundations of mathematics is vague, and the more\ninteraction there is between philosophers and mathematicians working\non questions pertaining to the nature of mathematics, the better.\n",
