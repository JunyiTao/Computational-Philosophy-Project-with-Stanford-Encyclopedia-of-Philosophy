    "main_text": "Varieties of Content || Indexical Content\n3.4 Indexical Contents\n\nMany contentful experiences seem to have contents that must be\nspecified by the use of indexical expressions, such as\n\u2018over there\u2019, \u2018to the left\u2019,\n\u2018here\u2019, \u2018in front of/behind me\u2019, \u2018just a\nsecond ago\u2019, \u2018since a few second ago\u2019, and so on.\nFor instance, some auditory experiences seem to present sounds as\ncoming from a direction relative to the ears; some proprioceptive\nexperiences seem to present pressure sensations as located in specific\nparts of the body; visual experiences seem to present things in\nlocations relative to the eyes and the rest of the body. More\ngenerally, contentful experiences present the world from the\nsubject\u2019s perspective both in space and in time. If one tried to\ncharacterize the perspective aspect of contents in language, it would\nbe natural to use indexical expressions for spatial properties, for\nthe subject herself, and for times.\n\nTo begin with spatial content, suppose you hear a sound as coming from\nyour left. Someone else facing you, due to different orientation,\nhears the same sound as coming from the right. Moreover, a third\nperceiver situated halfway around the world could hear a qualitatively\nidentical sound as coming from her left. The area to the\nfirst perceiver\u2019s left is the very same spot as the area to the\nsecond perceiver\u2019s right, whereas the area to the left of the\nthird perceiver, who is very far away from the other two, is a\ncompletely different part of space. Now, if contents are to reflect\nwhich side of the perceiver the sound seems to come from,\nthen it is not enough simply to include the very area from which\nsounds are coming in the content. That would not reflect what\u2019s\nin common between you and the third perceiver, who is halfway around\nthe world. It would also fail to reflect what\u2019s different\nbetween you and the second perceiver, who is differently oriented than\nyou. So it seems that some more specific representation of location\nand direction is needed.\n\nIf locations and directions are represented in experience, then it\nseems they are represented relative to the subject, in which case\nthere has to be some way of representing the subject herself (or\nitself)\u2014or at least the perceptual organs or body parts that are\non the subject-side of the spatial relations. This suggests that\nbodily awareness of some sort may be involved in contentful\nexperiences, even when those experiences are otherwise visual or\nauditory, so that experiential attitudes may have to be cross-modal,\nrather than being individuated simply by sensory modality. Another\nquestion is how self-representation works in experience. Some forms of\nself-awareness are cognitively demanding; yet representation of\nperceiver-relative locations and directions are clearly involved in\nexperiential contents. There is a theoretical need, then, for an\naccount of self-representations that could be had by cognitively\nprimitive creatures, such as animals and human infants (for\ndiscussion, see Peacocke 1994).\n\nPeacocke has argued (1992 chapter 3) that to adequately reflect the\nspatial and first-personal perspectives in experience, a special kind\nof content is needed. He calls his sort of content scenario\ncontent. Scenario contents are ways of filling out the space\naround the perceiver, consistent with the experience being correct.\nThey include a point of origin and orientation on axes, in relation to\nwhich things are located. In our example, the sound comes from the\nleft, relative to the origin in the subject\u2019s body, which\nPeacocke proposes is the middle of the chest.\n\nIndexical contents (spatial, first-personal and temporal) require\nmodification or further specification of all three views about the\ncontents of experience mentioned so far. In the case of possible-world\ncontents, one way to have such an axis is to appeal to centered\npossible worlds: worlds centered on a subject, and possibly also a\ntime and/or a location. The further features of the worlds can then be\nspecified in relation to the point of origin: in the example, coming\nfrom the left of the center (or being such-and-such distance and\ndirection from it). (See discussion of Peacocke\u2019s\n\u2018positioned scenarios\u2019 in his 1992 ch. 3 and below.)\n\nSomewhat similarly, Russellian contents may be modified in order to\nreflect first-personal indexical contents by introducing contents that\nare akin to open sentences, with a gap in place of a component\ncorresponding to the subject. In the example involving the red cube,\nthe contents might be something like a structured proposition\ncontaining the cube, the non-locational properties it appears to have\n(e.g., being red, being cubical, and so on), and then a component\nexpressed by \u2018two feet in front of ____\u2019, where the gap\ncan be filled in with different subjects in different circumstances.\nTo assess this special semantic entity for accuracy, the gap would\nneed to have a value. Whether its gap is filled or not, this entity is\nsomething that in principle two experiences had by different subjects\ncould share. For discussion of these contents for experience, see Bach\n1997 (in the Other Internet Resources section below); for a Fregean\nversion of gappy contents see Burge 1991 and Schellenberg 2010; for a\nRussellian version of gappy contents for belief and utterances, see\nBraun 1993.\n\nHow to treat indexicality is one of the main challenges to Fregean\ncontents of utterances as Frege himself understood these. (See Perry\n1977, Evans 1990, Burge 1991.) One of the roles of modes of\npresentation according to Frege was to determine reference, so that\nany two expressions (or occurrences thereof) with the same sense would\nhave the same reference. Another role is to reflect cognitive\nsignificance of sentences such as \u201cNow it is 5pm, October 1st\n2005\u201d. The occurrence of \u201cnow\u201d and of \u201c5pm\nOctober 1st 2005\u201d seem to refer to the same time, yet an\nutterance of the sentence could be informative to someone who did not\nknow the date and time. One and the same time seems in some intuitive\nsense to have different \u2018modes of presentation\u2019: one\nexpressed by \u2018now\u2019, the other expressed by \u20185pm\nOctober 1st 2005\u2019.\n\nIn the case of indexical expressions, it is hard to see what feature\nof the meaning of \u2018now\u2019, if any, plays both of these two\nroles. This poses a problem for the Fregean doctrine of senses. Later\ntheorists have rejected the feature of sense or modes of presentation\nwhereby they determine reference, while retaining the idea a single\nobject or property can have multiple modes of presentation. (See\nChalmers 2002). In rejecting the idea that modes of presentation\ndetermine referents by themselves, they say that reference is\ndetermined by mode of presentation plus select facts about the\nenvironment in which the utterance or experience are had.\n\nProponents of these new Fregean modes of presentation invoke them to\naccount for indexical features of experience contents. In the example\nof sounds coming from one\u2019s left, the new Fregeans about\nexperience contents invoke a mode of presentation that is shared by\nthe experiences of the two perceivers in different places who hear the\nsound coming from their left, and a different mode of presentation for\nthe experience of the perceiver who hears the sound as coming from the\nright. The former mode of presentation (roughly the same, they would\nsay, as the mode of presentation associated with the expression\n\u2018to the left\u2019) refers to different places for each\nperceiver. The latter mode of presentation (roughly the same, they\nwould say, as the mode of presentation had by the expression \u2018to\nthe right\u2019), when it\u2019s in the contents of the experience\nof the perceiver who hears the sound coming from the right, refers to\nthe same place as the mode of presentation \u2018to the left\u2019\nwhen it is in the contents of the experience of the original\nperceiver.\n\nModifications would also be needed for Russellian, possible-worlds, or\nFregean contents of beliefs; and proponents of each of these\nviews have discussed what those might be in the case of belief. (For\ndiscussion of indexicals and Russellian contents, see Kaplan 1977,\nSchiffer 1981, Austin 1990, and the entry on\n indexicals;\n for discussion of indexicals and possible-worlds content, see\nStalnaker 1981; for discussion of indexical beliefs and Fregean\ncontents, see Perry 1977; Evans 1981, McDowell 1984.) It is an open\nquestion whether modifications that succeed for the case of belief can\nalso succeed for the case of experience. An influential approach that\nhas been developed for both beliefs and experiences appeals to a\nspecial kind of possible world: centered worlds, where these are\npossible worlds marked with a designated subject and perhaps a\ndesignated time or other parameters. The centered-world framework can\nprovide a level of content that can be shared by two perceivers who\nperceive qualitatively identical but numerically distinct cubes in\ndifferent locations as being nearby: each experience is true in worlds\nwhere there is a cube nearby the designated center of that world.\nFeatures such as being nearby the center are called\n\u201ccentering features\u201d (see Egan 2006a, 2006b, 2010), and\ncan be used to describe both the phenomena that indexicals are apt for\ndescribing, as well as perceptual constancies and secondary qualities.\nFor discussion see Brogaard 2010 and 2018, Chalmers 2006, Egan 2006a,\n2006b, 2010, GReenberg 2018. Centered worlds are implicit in\nPeacocke\u2019s 1992 discussion of scenario content.\n",
