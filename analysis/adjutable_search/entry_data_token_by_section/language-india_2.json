    "main_text": "General philosophical approaches to the status of Vedic scriptures\n3. General philosophical approaches to the status of Vedic scriptures\n\nEarly Vedic notions about the authorship of the Vedic hymns are\ndifferent from philosophical views. Vedic hymns use words like\nk\u0101ru (\u201ccraftsman\u201d) to describe the poet, and\nthe act of producing a hymn is described as (\u1e5agveda\n10.71.2): \u201cLike cleansing barley with a sieve, the wise poets\ncreated the speech with their mind\u201d. The poets of the Vedic\nhymns are also called mantrak\u1e5bt (\u201cmakers of\nhymns\u201d). Further, each hymn of the Veda is associated with a\nspecific poet-priest and often with a family of poet-priests. But,\nalready in the \u1e5agveda, there are signs of the beginning\nof an impersonal conception of the origin of the Vedas. For instance,\nthe famous Puru\u1e63a-hymn of the \u1e5agveda\ndescribes the hymns of the \u1e5agveda, the formulae of\nYajus and the songs of S\u0101man as originating from the primordial\nsacrifice of the cosmic being (\u1e5agveda 10.90.9). This\ntrend to ascribe impersonal origin to the Vedas gets further\naccentuated in the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as and the\nUpani\u1e63ads.\n\nLater Hindu notions about the Vedic scriptures and their authority are\nin part reflections of Hindu responses to the criticisms of the Vedas\nlaunched by the Buddhists and the Jains. The early Buddhist critique\nof the Vedas targets the authors of the Vedic hymns. Vedic sages like\nVasi\u1e63\u1e6dha, Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra, and Bh\u1e5bgu are\ndescribed as the ancient authors of the mantras\n(por\u0101\u1e47\u0101 mant\u0101na\u1e43\nkatt\u0101ro), but they are criticized as being ignorant of\nthe true path to the union with Brahm\u0101 (Tevijjasutta;\nD\u012bghanik\u0101ya; Suttapi\u1e6daka). So the\nVedas are depicted as being words of ignorant human beings who do not\neven recognize their own ignorance. How can one trust such authors or\ntheir words? The Buddhist and the Jain traditions also rejected the\nnotion of God, and hence any claim that the Vedas were words of God,\nand hence authoritative, was not acceptable to them. On the other\nhand, the Jain and the Buddhist traditions claimed that their leading\nspiritual teachers like Mah\u0101v\u012bra and Buddha were omniscient\n(sarvaj\u00f1a) and were compassionate toward humanity at\nlarge, and hence their words were claimed to be authoritative.\n\nBeginning around 200 bce, Hindu ritualists\n(M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas) and logicians\n(Naiy\u0101yikas and Vai\u015be\u1e63ikas) began to\ndefend their religious faith in the Vedas and in the Brahmanical\nreligion with specific arguments. Some of these arguments have\nprecursors in the discussions of the early Sanskrit grammarians,\nK\u0101ty\u0101yana and Pata\u00f1jali. The\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas accepted the arguments of the\nBuddhists and the Jains that one need not accept the notion of a\ncreator-controller God. However, the\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas attempted to defend the Vedas\nagainst the criticism that the ancient human sages who authored the\nhymns of the Vedas were ignorant, while the figures like the Buddha\nand Mah\u0101v\u012bra were omniscient. They contested the notion of\nan omniscient person (sarvaj\u00f1a), and argued that no\nhumans could be omniscient and free from ignorance, passion, and\ndeceit. Therefore, the Buddha and Mah\u0101v\u012bra could not be free\nfrom these faults either, and hence their words cannot be trusted. On\nthe other hand, the Vedas were claimed to be eternal and intrinsically\nmeaningful words, uncreated by any human being\n(apauru\u1e63eya). Since they were not created by human\nbeings, they were free from the limitations and faults of human\nbeings. Yet the Vedas were meaningful, because the relationship\nbetween words and meanings was claimed to be innate. The Vedas were\nultimately seen as ordaining the performance of sacrifices. The\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas developed a theory of\nsentence-meaning which claimed that the meaning of a sentence centers\naround some specific action denoted by a verb-root and an injunction\nexpressed by the verbal terminations. Thus, language, especially the\nscriptural language, primarily orders us to engage in appropriate\nactions.\n\nIn this connection, we may note that\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 and other systems of Hindu\nphilosophy developed a notion of linguistic expression as one of the\nsources of authoritative knowledge\n(\u015babdapram\u0101\u1e47a), when other more basic sources\nof knowledge like sense perception (pratyak\u1e63a) and\ninference (anum\u0101na) are not available. Particularly, in\nconnection with religious duty (dharma), and heaven\n(svarga) as the promised reward, only the Veda is available\nas the source of authoritative knowledge. For\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101, the Veda as a source of\nknowledge is not tainted by negative qualities like ignorance and\nmalice that could affect a normal human speaker.\n\nTo understand the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 doctrine of\nthe eternality of the Vedas, we need to note that eternality implies\nthe absence of both a beginning and an end. In Indian philosophy, two\nkinds of persistence are distinguished, namely the ever unchanging\npersistence (k\u016b\u1e6dastha-nityat\u0101), like\nthat of a rock, and the continuous and yet incessantly changing\nexistence of a stream like that of a river\n(prav\u0101ha-nityat\u0101). The persistence claimed\nfor the Vedas by the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas would appear to be of\nthe k\u016b\u1e6dastha (\u201cunchanging\npersistence\u201d) kind, while its continuous study from time\nimmemorial would be of the prav\u0101ha-nitya\n(\u201cfluid persistence\u201d) kind. Further, the meanings which\nthe words signify are natural to the words, not the result of\nconvention. M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 does not think that\nthe association of a particular meaning with a word is due to\nconventions among people who introduce and give meanings to the words.\nFurther, words signify only universals. The universals are eternal.\nWords do not signify particular entities of any kind which come into\nbeing and disappear, but the corresponding universals which are\neternal and of which the transient individuals are mere instances.\nFurther, not only are the meanings eternal, the words are also\neternal. All words are eternal. If one utters the word\n\u201cchair\u201d ten times, is one uttering the same word ten\ntimes? The M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas say that, if the word is not the\nsame, then it cannot have the same meaning. The word and the meaning\nboth being eternal, the relation between them also is necessarily so.\nAn important argument with which the eternality of the Vedas is\nsecured is that of the eternality of the sounds of a language. \n\nThe M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 conceives of an unbroken and\nbeginningless Vedic tradition. No man or God can be considered to be\nthe very first teacher of the Veda or the first receiver of it,\nbecause the world is beginningless. It is conceivable that, just as at\npresent, there have always been teachers teaching and students\nstudying the Veda. For the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas, the Vedas are\nnot words of God. In this view, they seem to accept the Buddhist and\nthe Jain critique of the notion of God. There is no need to assume\nGod. Not only is there no need to assume that God was the author of\nthe Vedas, there is no need to assume a God at all. God is not\nrequired as a Creator, for the universe was never created. Nor is God\nrequired as the Dispenser of Justice, for karman brings its own\nfruits. And one does not need God as the author of the Vedas, since\nthey are eternal and uncreated to begin with. The \u1e5a\u1e63is,\nVedic sages, did not compose the Vedas. They merely saw them, and,\ntherefore, the scriptures are free from the taint of mortality\nimplicit in a human origin. The M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101\nnotion of the authority of the authorless Veda also depends upon their\nepistemic theory, that claims that all received cognitions are\nintrinsically valid (svata\u1e25\npram\u0101\u1e47a), unless and until they are falsified by\nsubsequent cognitions of higher order.\n\nThe traditions of the Naiy\u0101yikas and the Vai\u015be\u1e63ikas\nstrongly disagreed with the views of the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas\nand they developed their own distinctive conceptions of language,\nmeaning, and scriptural authority. They agreed with the\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas that the Vedas were a source of\nauthoritative knowledge\n(\u015babda-pram\u0101\u1e47a), and yet they\noffered a different set of reasons. According to them, only the words\nof a trustworthy speaker (\u0101pta) are a source of\nauthoritative knowledge. They joined the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas in\narguing that no humans, including Buddha and Mah\u0101v\u012bra, are\nfree from ignorance, passion, etc., and no humans are omniscient, and\ntherefore the words of no human being could be accepted as infallible.\nHowever, they did not agree with the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas in\ntheir rejection of the notion of God. In the metaphysics of the\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika tradition, the\nnotion of God plays a central role. In defending the notion of God (as\nin the Ny\u0101yakusum\u0101\u00f1jali of Udayana), they\nclaimed that God was the only being in the universe that was\nomniscient and free from the faults of ignorance and malice. He was a\ncompassionate being. Therefore, only the words of God could be\ninfallible, and therefore be trusted. For the Naiy\u0101yikas and\nVai\u015be\u1e63ikas, the Vedas were words of God, and not the words\nof human sages about God. The human sages only received the words of\nGod in their meditative trances, but they had no authorship role.\n\nOn a different level, this argument came to mean that God only spoke\nin Sanskrit, and hence Sanskrit alone was the language of God, and\nthat it was the best means to approach God. God willfully established\na connection between each Sanskrit word and its meaning, saying\n\u201clet this word refer to this thing.\u201d Such a connection was\nnot established by God for vernacular languages, which were only\nfallen forms of Sanskrit, and hence the vernaculars could not become\nvehicles for religious and spiritual communication. The\nNaiy\u0101yikas argued that vernacular words did not even have\nlegitimate meanings of their own. They claimed that the vernacular\nwords reminded the listener of the corresponding Sanskrit words that\ncommunicated the meaning.\n",
