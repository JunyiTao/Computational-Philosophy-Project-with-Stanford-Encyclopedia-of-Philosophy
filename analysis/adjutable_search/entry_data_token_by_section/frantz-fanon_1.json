    "main_text": "Algeria\n2. Algeria\n\nFanon\u2019s move to Algeria in 1953 marks an important turning point\nin his thought. He continues to write on anti-blackness in select\nessays and occasions, but Fanon\u2019s shift is deep and meaningful.\nWhereas Black Skin, White Masks was concerned exclusively\nwith the structure of an anti-black world and how that world bears on\nthe body and psyche of the colonized, Fanon\u2019s time in Algeria\nand later travels to sub-Saharan Africa broaden his analysis. Instead\nof a question of blackness, colonialism becomes for Fanon a larger,\nmore general question of the oppressed in the global south. The\nWretched of the Earth is the boldest and most important\nexpression of this shift, but the time he spends analyzing Algeria on\nits own terms reveals Fanon\u2019s increasing sensitivity to\ndifference inside the colonial experience. Also, many of his\nmost important writings in this period were published in French\nlanguage newspapers across the continent of Africa, in particular the\nAlgerian National Liberation Front (FLN) newspaper El\nMoudjahid (for which he served on the editorial board), which\nhosts some of his most interesting reflections. This shift in his\nthinking, as well as some of the later points of emphasis and\ntheoretical transitions, bolster Ato Sekyi-Otu\u2019s argument in\nFanon\u2019s Dialectic of Experience (1997) that\nFanon\u2019s work ought to be read as a series of political\nexperiences or stages in and at the basis of an unfolding of a long,\ncomplex system of thought.\n Three essays are of particular significance in this period:\n\u201cAlgeria\u2019s European Minority\u201d (\u201cLa minorit\u00e9\neurop\u00e9enne d\u2019Alg\u00e9rie\u201d), \u201cAlgeria\nUnveiled\u201d (\u201cL\u2019alg\u00e9rie se d\u00e9voile\u201d), and\n\u201cThe Algerian Family\u201d (\u201cLa famille\nalg\u00e9rienne\u201d).\n\nFanon\u2019s reflections in \u201cAlgeria\u2019s European\nMinority\u201d offer an important and insightful example of applying\nthe anti-colonial dimensions of Black Skin, White Masks. The\nkey anti-colonial insight in that text was how measure\u2014the\nimperial function of whiteness in the Black psyche\u2014structures\nthe world. Liberation, in Black Skin, White Masks, looks a\nlot like displacing measure in the name of the questioning subject.\nMeasure, here, means simply the ideal or standard according to which\n\u201cthe human\u201d is evaluated. Fanon\u2019s argument in\nBlack Skin, White Masks is that \u201cthe human\u201d, an\nidea that comes from the European tradition, is a fundamentally racial\nidea deployed as a tool of alienation for the colonized. Liberation\nfrom measure means displacing the racialized idea of the human and\ninitiating a movement toward, then into, a new humanism. When\nthis notion travels to Algeria in \u201cAlgeria\u2019s European\nMinority\u201d, a critical essay addressing the possibility of\nrevolutionary Europeans in North Africa, we see how it also applies to\nthe white minority under colonialism. The revolution in Algeria is a\nmoment of decision for all Algerians, and pointedly so in the case of\nthe European minority who had lived there for generations and at an\nelevated social and political status. The default mode, of course,\nwould be to associate the European minority with the colonizing power:\nFrance. But Fanon argues that this is not necessarily the case and\nthat, in fact, revolutionary solidarity across racial-national lines\nis possible, even necessary (and, through examples in the text,\nactually practiced). Algeria, then, is revealed to be as much an\nideological category for identification with as it is a national,\nreligious, or racial category. The Wretched of the Earth will\nexplore these possibilities even further as a blueprint for the\ncolonized global South. But Fanon is particularly meticulous in\n\u201cAlgeria\u2019s European Minority\u201d, examining in detail\nhow each twist and turn of the psyche reflects possibilities and\nlimits, and in that meticulousness shows the enduring insight from the\nopening of Black Skin, White Masks \u2013 namely, that white\npeople are locked into whiteness, Black people into blackness.\n\u201cAlgeria\u2019s European Minority\u201d unpacks the process by\nwhich white people can unlock themselves in or be unlocked by\nanti-colonial struggle and revolutionary action. In that sense, the\ntext is an important study of how what comes to be called \u201crace\ntraitor\u201d politics can and should work in a revolutionary\ncontext.\n\nIn \u201cAlgeria Unveiled\u201d, Fanon explores the relationship\nbetween Islam, tradition, colonial rule, and revolutionary\nconsciousness. The veil puzzles Fanon and challenges his deepest\npolitical commitment: postcoloniality means an embrace of the\nnew. Revolution is absolute and radical, marking a break with the\npast rather than a return to a different version of the past. The\nfuture is the future, and so full of the unprecedented. What does that\nmean for traditions that have been suppressed by colonial rule, for\nexample the veil in Islamic cultural practice? In his work on\nblackness, Fanon was quite clear that a return to African\ncivilization\u2014the imperative of the N\u00e9gritude\nmovement\u2014represents a mirage and only doubles the loss of the\npast by losing black people in an illusion. But that is not the case\nwith his treatment of Islamic traditions in Algeria and other parts of\nthe Maghreb. The suppression of those traditions, on Fanon\u2019s\naccount, marginalize or push tradition into secret\u2014or, perhaps,\nkeep the tradition in the open, but always as backward, abject, and\ncontrary to modernity. This means tradition is still alive, not a\nmirage, and as alive also valued deeply by communities resisting\ncolonial rule. Such traditions can be instrumentalized for the sake of\nrevolutionary action, only to be evaluated after colonialism\nfor their suitability in a postcolonial nation and culture. The same\nlogic is elaborated in \u201cThe Algerian Family\u201d, where Fanon\nexplores the traditional structure of families in Algeria, in\nparticular how those families set gender identity, power, marriage,\nand reproduction in fixed roles. Revolutionary families, he argues,\nidentify these fixed roles and break with them while also\nmaintaining a conviction that their practices are Algerian\u2014that\nis, Algerian in the new sense.\n\nThese reflections on racial-national identification, religion, gender,\nand family all return to the same basic argument: revolution is about\nthe new. But that does not mean merely rejecting the past and\nsuspending all tradition. Rather, it means, for Fanon, identifying\nsites for transformation inside tradition, with emphasis on those\nsites which offer revolutionary or tactical possibilities. These\nessays and the many shorter companion pieces from the time show Fanon\npuzzling over his dual commitments\u2014to a revolution that is\nalways for the future and to \u201cthe people\u201d who are often\ndeeply committed to traditions. Thinking through that crossing of\ncommitments is the task of any revolutionary thought and Fanon\u2019s\ncareful thinking is exemplary.\n",
