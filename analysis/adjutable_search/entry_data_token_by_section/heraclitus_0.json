    "main_text": "Life and Work\n1. Life and Work\n\nLittle is known of Heraclitus\u2019 life; most of what has been\nhanded down consists of stories apparently invented to illustrate his\ncharacter as inferred from his writings (Diogenes Laertius\n9.1\u201317). His native Ephesus was a prominent city of Ionia, the\nGreek-inhabited coast of Asia Minor, but was subject to Persian rule\nin his lifetime. According to one account, he inherited the honorific\ntitle and office of \u201cking\u201d of the Ionians, which he\nresigned to his brother. He is generally considered to have favored\naristocratic government as against democracy, based on his own\npolitical observations. \n\nHis city lies close to Miletus, where the first thinkers recognized in\nlater tradition as philosophers lived; but there is no record of his\nhaving made the acquaintance of any of the Milesian thinkers (Thales,\nAnaximander, Anaximenes) or having been taught by them, or of his ever\nhaving traveled.\n\nHe is said to have written a single book (papyrus roll), and deposited\nit in the great temple of Artemis at Ephesus. The story is plausible\nenough: temples often served as depositories for money and other\nvaluables, and no libraries are known from the time of Heraclitus. The\nstructure of Heraclitus\u2019 book is controversial. It could have\nconsisted of a relatively coherent and consecutive argument. On the\nother hand, the numerous fragments (over one hundred) that have come\ndown to us do not easily connect with each other, even though they\nprobably constitute a sizable fraction of the whole. Thus it is\npossible and even likely that the book was composed more of sayings\nand epigrams than of continuous exposition. In its form, then, it\nmight have looked more like a collection of proverbs such as were\nascribed to the seven sages than like a cosmological treatise of the\nMilesians. Theophrastus, who knew his book, said that it seemed only\nhalf-finished, a kind of hodgepodge he attributed to the\nauthor\u2019s melancholy. Diogenes Laertius reports that the work was\ndivided (he does not say by whom) into three sections, one on\ncosmology, one on politics (and ethics), and one on theology\n(9.5\u20136). All these topics are treated in the extant fragments of\nHeraclitus, though it is often difficult to see what boundaries the\nwork might have drawn between them, since Heraclitus seems to see deep\ninterconnections between science, human affairs, and theology.\n\nUnlike most other early philosophers, Heraclitus is usually seen as\nindependent of the several schools and movements later students\n(somewhat anachronistically) assigned to the ancients, and he himself\nimplies that he is self-taught (B101). He has been variously judged by\nancient and modern commentators to be a material monist or a process\nphilosopher; a scientific cosmologist, a metaphysician, or a mainly\nreligious thinker; an empiricist, a rationalist, or a mystic; a\nconventional thinker or a revolutionary; a developer of logic or one\nwho denied the law of non-contradiction; the first genuine philosopher\nor an anti-intellectual obscurantist. No doubt the sage of Ephesus\nwill continue to remain controversial and difficult to interpret, but\nscholars have made significant progress in understanding and\nappreciating his work.\n",
