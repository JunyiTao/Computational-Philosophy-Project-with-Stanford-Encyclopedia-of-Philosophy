Whereas Virgil\nAldrich (1963) proclaims the term \u2018work of art\u2019 useful\nbecause of its ambivalence, others (e.g., Boas 1937) have found the\npervasive ambiguity in the discourse about artworks (starting with a\nprocess/product conflation) troublesome and in need of\nclarification. I. A. Richards famously wrote that people\n\u201cnaturally talk about poems (and pictures, etc.) in a way which\nmakes it impossible for anybody to discover what it is we are talking\nabout\u201d (1924, 176).  Evoking the \u201cvague\u201d and\n\u201cdiverse\u201d usage of the term, Francis Sparshott (1963)\nworried that the question about what sort of thing a work of art is\nmight have no precise answer.  Richard Shusterman concurs, and passes\nthe question of the identity of the work of art along to the\n\u201cpiecemeal efforts of practicing art critics\u201d (1980,\n543). Claudine Tercelin (2005) develops a Peircean perspective attuned\nto the possibility of an irreducible, ontic vagueness in art (and\nelsewhere).\n\n\nThomasson (2005) argues that the relevant sortals yield only vague and\nincomplete identity and persistence conditions. As a result, some\nquestions in the ontology of art admit of no precise answers. A good\nexample would be the question of just how faulty a performance of a\ndifficult composition can be and still count as a performance of the\nwork. She also holds that there is no justifiable response to the\nquestion of whether a poem has actually been created when the poet has\na complete sequence of words in mind but has never spoken it aloud or\nwritten it down (2005, 227). Thomasson\u2019s skepticism, however, is\na limited one: some art-ontological questions do have determinate\nanswers about which sufficiently well-informed practitioners in the\nworld of art could not be wrong. Thomasson reasons that competent\nusers of the discourse successfully refer to particular novels,\npaintings, and symphonies, so they must have reliable concepts when it\ncomes to the relevant art kinds. Thomasson does not, however, believe\nthat the same argument works for the more general concept, work of\nart.\n\n\nDominic McIver Lopes (2007) accepts the premise that art-ontological\nquestions find answers in sound art-appreciative practice, but\nconjectures, with reference to examples of Japanese architecture, that\nsuch practices vary significantly across cultures. Rafael De Clercq\n(2008) proposes an alternative explication of the Japanese examples;\nin a response to De Clercq, Lopes surveys the options and concludes\nthat they \u201call challenge some widespread philosophical doctrines\nabout the cultural invariance of ontology or reference\u201d (2008,\n196).\n\n\n\nPepper, who struggled with art-ontological issues for several decades,\nended up proclaiming in his (1952) that \u2018work of art\u2019 is\nbest understood as a \u201cportmanteau\u201d expression on which are\nhung significantly different conceptual garments. In his early\nwritings on the ontology of art (e.g., 1937b, 231; 1946), Pepper had\ndistinguished between the work of art and \u201cthe aesthetic\nwork.\u201d In response to published objections and queries (Nathan\nBerall 1951, James L. Jarrett 1952, Robert Hoffman 1962), he later\ndrew a distinction between what he proposed to call \u2018the control\nobject\u2019 (that he had previously referred to as the\n\u2018physical work of art\u2019 or \u2018the vehicle\u2019) and\nthe object of critical evaluation (previously, \u2018the aesthetic\nwork of art\u2019).\n\n\nVarious terms for a distinction in this vicinity have been\nemployed. Hermann Siebek (1875, 7) and von Hartmann (1888, vol. 2, 35,\n208) both used the term \u2018Vehikel\u2019 to refer to the\nmaterial or perceptible bases of aesthetic objects and works of\nart. Volkelt (1905, 11) used the term\n\u2018Ausserdinge\u2019 to refer to the non-psychological\nitems that make up what he called the \u201cpre-aesthetic basis of\nthe work of art.\u201d H. S. Goodhart-Rendel (1934) distinguished\nbetween the material of art, the artistic vehicle, and the work of\nart. His idea is that the vehicle is whatever is used to\n\u201cexternalize\u201d the work or to \u201cdisclose it to the\nworld\u201d (1934, 4). In the case of music, the sound is the\nvehicle; sound is not the artist\u2019s material, however, because\nsome musicians can compose in their heads, and on\nGoodhart-Rendel\u2019s usage, only those media that are necessary to\nworking in an art form are to be taken as materials. All that is\nstrictly necessary to musical composition is an idea or thought of a\nsequence of sounds.\n\n\nThe term \u2018vehicle\u2019 was taken up again by Harold Osborne,\nwho defined it as what \u201cenables the same organization of material\nto enter the experience of different persons at different times\u201d\n(1953, 96). A particular arrangement of pigments upon a canvas or\nsome other surface could be the vehicle of a work, but the work itself\nis distinct from its material component. The work is not the\nvehicle alone, but \u201can enduring possibility, often enshrined or\nrecorded in a material medium, of a specific set of sensory\nimpressions\u201d (1953, 100).\n\n\nFor those who dislike the medical and other connotations of the term\n\u2018vehicle\u2019, there are other options. Ruby Meager uses\nthe term \u2018manifestation\u2019, commenting that \u201ca poem is\nlike a universal in being capable of multiple manifestations of which\nno single one can count as the poem itself\u201d (1958\u201359, 52).\nMany writers have preferred the term \u2018instances\u2019.\nCurrie, for example, defines \u2018instance\u2019 as \u201call those\nconcrete things that we come into contact with when we experience a\nwork of art\u201d (1989, 5).\n\n\nWhy distinguish between the work of art and its vehicle,\nmanifestation, or control object? Various reasons have motivated such\ndistinctions. One line of thought is that a work is\n\u201cconstituted\u201d by a material object or vehicle, where the\nconstitution relation is not a matter of identity (for background, see\nthe entry on material constitution). Roger Pouivet (2000, 2010) has\nbrought such arguments to bear on a number of issues in the ontology\nof art. Simon J. Evnine (2009, 2016) develops a constitution theory as\nwell.\n\n\nJohn Dilworth (2005a) distinguishes between the concrete artifact or\nevent and the artwork. In his view the relation between them is\nrepresentational. The artifact or event represents the work, which in\nturn represents other content, namely, the subject matter of the\nwork.\n\n\nIn an analogy that some philosophers (e.g., Arthur C. Danto 1993,\n199\u2013200) have taken quite seriously, the vehicle is to the work\nas the body is to the person; for a very early remark in this vein,\nsee Johan Georg Sulzer (1792, vol. 4, 727), who declares that the work\nof art has both body (the artistic material or Stoff), and\nsoul or Geist (the representation\nor Darstellung). Another way of motivating the distinction in\naesthetics is to say, along with Pepper and others, that reference to\nthe vehicle or artistic structure alone does not suffice to identify\nthe object of critical evaluation, or what artistic and aesthetic\nappreciation is really about.\n\n\nThe next section evokes a commonly told story about the basis\nof a work-object distinction, indicating some ways in which this story\nis misleading.\n2.2.1 Indiscernibility and the story of Pierre Menard\n\n\nIn his widely cited 1964 paper, \u201cThe Artworld,\u201d Danto\ncleverly evoked ways in which perceptually indistinguishable painted\ncanvases could be the vehicles of strikingly different works of art\nbearing different titles and contrasting artistic and aesthetic\nqualities. It follows, Danto reasons, that the painted canvas\nalone is not the work of art, unless\u2018is\u2019has a special sense.\n\n\nIn a reply to questions raised by Sparshott (1976), Danto claimed to\nhave been \u201cloosely following a famous model in the philosophy of\nperception\u201d when he began to explore the implications of\nindiscernibles for issues in aesthetics (1976, 80). Yet at the\noutset of the second chapter of his 1981 book, The Transfiguration\nof the Commonplace, Danto commented: \u201cthe possibility was\nfirst recognized, I believe, in connection with literary works, by\nBorges, who has the glory of having discovered it in his masterpiece,\nPierre Menard, Symbolist Poet\u201d [sic]. \n\n\nIt is certainly the case that many philosophers have found inspiration\nin Jorge Luis Borges\u2019s 1939 story, \u201cPierre Menard, autor\ndel Quijote,\u201d an English translation of which first appeared in\n1962 (for more on this topic, see Livingston and Pettersson\n2016). This short story is not easy to summarize, but one relevant\npart of it concerns a French symbolist who sets out to create a novel\nby rewriting\u2014without simply copying\u2014the text of\nCervantes\u2019s masterpiece. The narrator of the story makes\nobservations about ways in which Menard\u2019s work would be\ndifferent from Cervantes\u2019s even if Menard somehow managed to\nproduce something \u201cverbally identical\u201d to what Cervantes\nhad written.\n\n\nIn English-language philosophical publications, the earliest reference\nto the tale and to its implications for the ontology of art appears in\nSavile\u2019s (1971) essay on Goodman\u2019s Languages of\nArt (for background, see the entry on Goodman\u2019s\naesthetics). Subsequent references to the story\u2019s philosophical\nimplications include Walton (1973), Wollheim (1978), Goodman (1978),\nDavid K. Lewis (1978), Levinson (1980a, 2012), Ben Tilghman (1982),\nSusan Wilsmore (1987), Currie (1989), Jean-Marie Schaefer (1989),\nMichael Wreen (1990), David Davies (1991, 2010), Christopher Janaway\n(1992), Lamarque (1998, 2010), Jacques Morizot (1999), and the papers\nin Petr Kot\u2019\u00e1tko and Karel Cisar (2004).\n\n\nSavile presented what he referred to as the\n\u201cBorges-paradox\u201d in order to contest some of\nGoodman\u2019s claims about the individuation of works of art.  More\nspecifically, Goodman had distinguished between\n\u201cautographic\u201d and \u201callographic\u201d works, where\nthe former, unlike the latter, are susceptible to forgery. Moving\nquickly, the thought is that while it is possible to make a more or\nless successful forgery of a particular painting, it is impossible to\nmake a deceptive copy of a work of literature because any verbally\nidentical instance of the text is a good copy of the work, or in\nGoodman\u2019s terms, an instance produced in conformity with a\nsystem of notation (for discussion of Goodman\u2019s distinction, see\nLevinson 1980b, Pillow 2003, and the entry on\n Goodman\u2019s aesthetics).\n\n\nSavile presents the Pierre Menard case as a counterexample to\nGoodman\u2019s thesis that the identity conditions of allographic\nworks are determined by a notational scheme.\n\n\nTwo numerically distinct tokens of the same \u201cverbally\nidentical\u201d text-type could be generated by different literary\nauthors\u2014Menard and Cervantes\u2014working in significantly\ndifferent artistic contexts. These could, then, be the texts of two\nartistically different works. Ergo, the work is not the text. Turning\nfrom literature to music, Savile asks us to imagine a case where\nStockhausen independently composes \u201can ode notationally and\nsemantically identical\u201d with a composition by Stamitz. Savile\nproposes that \u201cWe should certainly not say that they had\ncomposed the same work, for the way in which it would be appropriate\nto hear them would be quite different\u201d (1971, 23; cf. Levinson\n1980a).\n\n\nThe Borgesian narrator also floats the idea that one work could have\ntwo artistically different texts, which could be taken as reinforcing\na Borges-inspired assault on a text-to-work biconditional (Paisley\nLivingston 2005a). Generalizing, we end up with a broad distinction\nbetween works of art and their \u201cobjects\u201d or vehicles.\n\n\nThere has unsurprisingly been some skepticism about both\nthe distinction between vehicle and work, and the idea that cogent\nreasoning in favor of such a distinction is really to be found in the\nBorges story. Tilghman (1982), Currie (1989, 134 n. 19) and\nLamarque (2010), for example, raise questions about the intelligibility\nand coherence of that part of the Borges story that concerns Pierre\nMenard\u2019s unusual intentions and putative achievement with regard\nto the writing of \u201chis\u201d Quixote. What are we supposed\nto imagine about Menard\u2019s ambition in setting out to\n\u201crewrite\u201d but not copy the text of the novel by\nCervantes? Is this a psychologically coherent project? What\nis more, is there any good reason to think of his text as a new\nwork? For denials, see Goodman (1978) and Goodman and Catherine\nZ. Elgin (1988), who contend that Menard\u2019s text, if brought to\ncompletion, would only be a \u201creplica\u201d of\nCervantes\u2019s.\n\n\nWith regard to the text-work distinction and the more general\narguments given in support of it, various doubts have been\nraised. Wollheim (1993) challenges the evidentiary value of thought\nexperiments in a context where the concept in question\u2014in this\ncase, the one evoked by the expression \u2018work of\nart\u2019\u2014has no determinate conditions for its application,\nbut only some broad assumptions that can easily be\n\u201ctransgressed\u201d by the apparent results of a thought\nexperiment. Tilghman had complained a decade earlier that Danto did\nnot specify any criteria of work constitution. Tilghman (1982) added\nthat the ontological question of constitution is in any case not\ncrucial to questions about criticism and appreciation.\n\n\nIt can also be reasonably doubted whether the Borges story truly\nmerits the \u201cglory\u201d of discovery to which Danto\nalludes. Lamarque (1998, 2010) finds evidence of the key\ncontextualist insight, or at least closely related points, in passages\nfrom both Shakespeare and Kant.\n2.2.2 Carl Lange\u2019s indiscernibles\n\n\nAnother earlier and little-known contribution on our topic was made by\nthe Danish physician and neurologist, Carl Georg Lange\n(1834\u20131900). Lange\u2019s book of 1899, Bidrag til\nNydelsernes Fysiologi som grundlag for en rationel \u00e6stetik,\nthe title of which can be translated quite literally as\n\u2018Contribution to the Physiology of the Pleasures as Foundation\nfor a Rational Aesthetics\u2019, begins with a lengthy survey of the\nauthor\u2019s ideas about the nature of the various sources of\nenjoyment or pleasure, and then moves on to apply these ideas to the\narts and beauty.\n\n\nLange argues that the various sorts of enjoyments or pleasures [the\nDanish \u2018nydelser\u2019 is ambiguous between the two]\ngiven to us by works of art have a few basic sources, including\nvariety [afvekslingen] and the arousal of sympathy. He also\nstresses the art appreciator\u2019s admiration of the artist\u2019s manifest\novercoming of artistic difficulties in the creation of the work. The\nawareness that very few people, or perhaps even only a unique\nindividual [den Enkelte], could have brought about a particularly\ninnovative and difficult artistic achievement is a distinct source of artistic\nenjoyment. Lange wants to argue that this type of artistic enjoyment\ndepends upon the appreciator\u2019s awareness of aspects of the art\nobject\u2019s origins. One can only admire a work, in the special sense of\nartistic admiration or \u2018beundring\u2019 conceived of\nby Lange, to the extent that one can understand and evaluate the\nartistic difficulties the artist has overcome. Although Lange here\nrepeats a claim made in earlier aesthetic treatises (e.g. V\u00e9ron\n1878, 63), he takes the argument one step further. He turns to an\nimaginary indiscernibility example in an effort to make a point about\nthe relevant aspects \u201cin a work\u201d [i et\nV\u00e6rk] that can give rise to the special kind of enjoyment\nhe has in mind:\n\n\nThere are examples where people, and this includes even the experts,\ndisagree over which of two paintings is the original and which is a\ncopy. In such a situation one should think that the artistic\npleasures these two paintings occasion must be more or less the same,\nand indeed they are, up to the moment when the doubt is removed.\nOnce this happens the difference is very large, as history shows.\nNothing prevents us in any case from imagining a copy that so\nperfectly reproduces the original that there is no way to distinguish\nthem from each other. Yet there is all the difference in the\nworld between the enjoyments they occasion. The enjoyment value\nof the copy, and with it, its economic value, is negligible compared to\nthat of the original, and this notwithstanding the fact that they\nresemble each other like two drops of water (1899, 125\u2013126, my\ntrans.).\n\n\nLange holds, in other words, that one object of aesthetic admiration\nand enjoyment is the relational event of artist A in\ncontext C creating something sufficiently novel to provide an\naudience with a certain type of pleasure. Lange explicitly insists\nthat the kind of value he has in mind is \u201cin\u201d the work,\nbut not an intrinsic feature of the (tokens of) the visually identical\nimage type.\n\n\nAs will become apparent below, the debate between monisms and their\nrivals in the ontology of art continues.\n",
