    "preamble": "\n\n\nPhilip the Chancellor was an influential figure in a number of\ndifferent circles in the first half of the thirteenth century. He\nenjoyed a long though rather turbulent ecclesiastical career and was\nfamous for his sermons and his lyric poetry, the latter of which has\nreceived attention by a number of musicologists in recent years (see\nDronke 1987, Payne 1991, Traill 2003). In the areas of philosophy and\ntheology, his major work, Summa de bono, which was composed\nsometime in the 1220s\u20131230s, was a ground-breaking achievement\nin many ways. Philip was one of the first to organize a Summa\naround a central foundational principle, the notion of the\ngood. Summa de bono also contains most likely the earliest\ntreatment of a topic that rose to prominence in the later medieval\nperiod, the doctrine of the transcendentals. Elements of Philip\u2019s\ntheory of action drew comments from such later notables as Albert the\nGreat. Summa de bono was a well-respected and influential\nwork in the thirteenth century (see Keeler 1937, Callus 1941\u201343,\nPrincipe 1962). \n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Philip\u2019s Life\n\n\nPhilip was born in Paris probably in the 1160s, the exact date\nunknown.  He was a member of a prominent Parisian family; many of his\nrelatives held important positions, in service to the French kings or\nto the church. Several were bishops of prominent sees, in particular,\nhis uncle, Peter of Nemours, who was bishop of Paris from 1208 to 1218\nand who helped to foster Philip\u2019s career. Most likely, Philip\nreceived his education at the nascent University of Paris, where he\nalso taught.  Sometime in the early 1200s, he was appointed archdeacon\nof Noyon, a position he held even after becoming chancellor of the\nCathedral of Notre Dame in Paris in 1217. Philip died in 1236, most\nlikely on December 26. \n2. Philip\u2019s Career as Chancellor\n\n\nThe position of chancellor at the cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris was\none of some importance, although it was the lowest ranking office in\nthe administrative hierarchy of the chapter. Minor duties included\nkeeping the official seal of the chapter, executing the official\ndecrees of the administrative body, maintaining the non-musical books\nof the library, and serving in the liturgy of the daily office. His\nmost significant responsibility was in the area of education. The\nchancellor was originally the head of the cathedral school. As masters\nbegan to flock to Paris in the late twelfth and early thirteenth\ncenturies, especially to the Ile-de-la-Cit\u00e9, where Notre Dame\nis located, the chancellor\u2019s supervision was extended to include\nthese masters as well. His power lay in his authority to grant the\nteaching license, which was required in order to hold classes in one\nof the schools springing up on the Ile-de-la-Cit\u00e9. It was the\nchancellor\u2019s duty to evaluate candidates applying for this\nlicense. Moreover, the chancellor had the right to revoke the license\nshould a master prove unworthy or incompetent, as well as the\nresponsibility for maintaining order and discipline among the scholars\nwithin his jurisdiction. \n\n\nBy the time Philip became chancellor in 1217, the masters of the\nvarious schools in Paris had begun to seek autonomy from the cathedral\nchapter and had won a number of important concessions by papal decree.\nIn 1215, the papal legate, Robert of Cour\u00e7on, drew up a number\nof formal statutes, codifying the de facto practices\nregarding matters such as the examinations for teaching licenses,\naccepted dress and behavior, curriculum, and discipline of\nstudents. As a result, by the time that Philip became chancellor, at\nleast on paper, it appeared as if the power of his office had been\ngreatly reduced, even with respect to granting the teaching\nlicense. For although the chancellor retained the power to grant these\nlicenses, the statutes dictated that he could not turn down anyone the\nmasters deemed fit to teach. But in reality, a long struggle ensued\nbetween the masters and the chancellor, who sought to retain his\npower, beginning with Philip\u2019s predecessor (Stephen of Reims)\nand continuing into much of Philip\u2019s own tenure.  Finally, in\nthe late 1220s and early 1230s, Philip made his peace with the\nmasters, who had gone on strike and left Paris along with many of\ntheir students in response to a conflict with the secular authorities.\nNo doubt recognizing that their departure imperiled the continuing\nprestige of Paris as a center of education, as well as his own\nposition, Philip worked hard to convince the scholars to return to\nParis and reconvene their classes. His efforts were successful, and\nthe masters returned in 1231 (for more on Philip\u2019s life and\ncareer, see Payne 1991).\n3. Philip\u2019s Philosophical Significance\n\n\nIn his major philosophical work, Summa de bono, Philip uses\nthe notion of the good as an organizing principle for his study. He\ndivides the text roughly into four sections. Philip discusses first\nthe nature of good in general terms, and then the highest good and its\nrelationship to created goods. After this rather short introduction to\nthe notion of the good, Philip goes on to examine in some depth the\nvarious sorts of created goods. He divides his discussion of created\ngoods into three parts. First, he looks at the good retained by\ncreatures by virtue of their natures (bonum naturae). In\nturn, these goods fall into two categories: those goods that cannot be\ndiminished by evil and those goods that can be lost through evil. In\nhis discussion of the former, Philip focuses first on the angels and\ntheir properties, and then on human beings and their properties. Those\ngoods that can be affected by evil are discussed in conjunction with\nAdam\u2019s fall from grace in the Garden and its\nconsequences. Following the discussion of bonum naturae,\nPhilip considers what he calls bonum in genere. Although this\nsort of good has a rather peculiar title, the bonum in genere\nrepresents goods that come about as a result of an agent\u2019s\nactions. These goods have this title because what determines whether a\ngiven act is good depends not only on the sort of act it is (its\n\u201cform\u201d so to speak) but also what the act has to do with\n(its \u201cmatter\u201d so to speak), thus suggesting that these\nsorts of goods can be classified along the lines of genera and\nspecies.  Moreover, these sorts of generic goods contrast with the\nmeritorious goods brought about as the result of God\u2019s\ngrace. After discussing the\nbonum in genere, Philip goes on to look at the good that is\nassociated with grace. Here, he divides his treatment into the graces\nthat pertain to angels (as well as their ministries) and the graces\nthat pertain to human beings. Philip includes the virtues in his\ndiscussion of human graces. Although he denies that the virtues are a\ntype of grace, he includes them in this section because virtues come\nabout as a result of grace working within human beings. This idea is\nmost naturally associated with the theological virtues of faith, hope,\nand charity, and indeed, Philip discusses these virtues here at some\nlength. But he also includes in this section a lengthy discussion of\nthe cardinal virtues: prudence, fortitude, temperance (and the\nassociated virtues of modesty, sobriety, continence, and virginity),\nand justice, virtues which one might argue have no direct connection\nwith grace. Philip admits that strictly speaking cardinal virtues are\nnot divine virtues since they have to do with what is for the sake of\nthe end and not directly with the end itself (the end of course being\nGod). But he argues that justice has to do both with God and with human\ngovernance; perhaps because of this connection, he felt justified\nin including them in a broader discussion of grace.  Philip ends his\nwork with another source of grace, the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit.\nHis discussion of the good of grace in human beings occupies over\nhalf of Summa de bono with his unit on the virtues accounting\nfor a large portion of this section. \n\n\nPhilip\u2019s Summa de bono represents a significant innovation\nin medieval philosophical work. His use of the good as an organizing\nprinciple is a departure from the explicitly theological structure of\nother well-known texts of the time including Peter Lombard\u2019s\nSentences and William of Auxerre\u2019s Summa\naurea.  Philip is certainly concerned with theological issues;\nAertsen points out that in the prologue, Philip explicitly mentions\nthe need to provide a philosophical response to the Manichean heresy\nas part of his justification in developing an account of the good\n(Aertsen 2012). It is also true that Philip discusses the difference\nbetween God\u2019s goodness and created goodness. Nevertheless, these\ntheological notions do not provide the intellectual framework for\nPhilip\u2019s discussion. Unlike the\nSentences or Summa aurea, Philip devotes no\nsignificant sections of his work to topics such as God\u2019s nature, the\nIncarnation, or the sacraments. Whereas often William\u2019s or\nLombard\u2019s examination of a philosophical issue arises in the context of\na larger theological issue, this is not generally the case for Philip. For\nexample, in William\u2019s Summa aurea, the issues of human action\nand its freedom arise within a discussion of Adam\u2019s fall in the Garden.\nWilliam raises these issues here because he recognizes that holding\nAdam responsible for his sin requires that Adam acted freely. Philip\nplaces his treatment of free action within an examination of human\npsychology. It is not until after he discusses the character and\nthe powers of the human soul that he gets around to examining\ntheological issues such as the origin and the immortality of the soul.\nPhilip is one of the first major thinkers in the Latin West whose\nwork reflects the influence of the recent influx of newly translated\ntexts from Aristotle and his Arabic commentators, particularly in the\narea of metaphysics. This helps to explain the distinctive character\nof his work (see MacDonald 1992). His use of Aristotelian metaphysics\nis especially interesting given that many of Aristotle\u2019s\nmetaphysical treatises and work in natural philosophy were officially\nbanned at Paris during the time that he was working on Summa de\nbono. Philip\u2019s text greatly influenced that of his\ncontemporaries and successors, including Albertus Magnus, Alexander of\nHales, and even Thomas Aquinas (see MacDonald 1992, Houser 2004,\nLottin 1957).\n4. Philip\u2019s Innovative Theory of the Transcendentals\n\n\nPhilip\u2019s influence in the thirteenth century was especially felt\nin the area of the transcendentals and in action theory. In this\nsection, I will consider his theory of the transcendentals (although\nhe does not in fact use that term; see Aertsen 2012). I will examine\nhis theory of action in the following section. To some extent, the\ndoctrine of the transcendentals has its roots in the\nChristian-Platonic discussions of the relationship between created and\ndivine being and goodness, in particular, in Boethius\u2019s De\nhebdomadibus, which greatly influenced William of Auxerre\u2019s\ntreatment of goodness prefatory to his examination of the virtues\nin Summa aurea (see Aertsen 2012).  However, its more\nimmediate ancestor is Aristotle\u2019s doctrine of the categories\n(see MacDonald 1992). Certain properties fall into none of\nAristotle\u2019s categories; rather they are properties of all of the\nthings to which the categories are applicable. For this reason, these\nproperties are said to \u201ctranscend\u201d the\ncategories. Although there is some variation in what is counted as a\ntranscendental, the list generally included being, unity, truth, and\ngoodness. Thus, everything that falls into any of Aristotle\u2019s\ncategories is a being, has a certain sort of unity, and is true and\ngood to a certain extent. \n\n\nNot only do these properties transcend the categories and as a result,\napply to everything classified by the categories, but they are held to\nbe convertible with each other as well. This could mean one of two\nthings. The transcendentals could be coextensional, so that whatever\nhas being also has unity, truth, and goodness. This leaves open the\npossibility that the transcendentals are separate and distinct from\none another. The second option of the convertibility thesis involves a\nstronger claim, namely, the idea that the transcendentals differ from\none another only in concept, not in reality. Unity, truth, and\ngoodness add nothing to a particular being over and above what is\nalready there; everything that is a being is also one, true, and good\nin virtue of the very same characteristics. But to describe something\nas a being and to describe it as, say, good is to express two\ndifferent things about it since the concept of a being and the concept\nof a good are two very different concepts. Thus, while being and\ngoodness are extensionally equivalent, they are intensionally\ndistinct.\n\n\nPhilip adopts the second notion of convertibility. The various\ntranscendentals do not differ in reality, only in concept. The concept\nof being is fundamental in that the concepts of the other\ntranscendentals presuppose it. However, the concepts of all of the\nother transcendentals add a certain basic notion to the notion of\nbeing in order to differentiate them from being (see Aertsen 2012,\nMacDonald 1992). This basic notion is the notion of being that is\nundivided. Because this is a purely negative notion, it picks out no\nadditional property in reality. The addition of indivision alone\nyields the concept of unity. To derive the concepts of the true and\nthe good, one adds further the notion of the appropriate cause. The\nconcept of truth involves the idea of the formal cause, that is, the\ncause in virtue of which matter is enformed, and a thing becomes what\nit is. Things are true, that is, genuine instances of the kind of\nthing they are to the extent that they instantiate the form of things\nof that kind. Thus, the concept of truth is the concept of being that\nis undivided from a formal cause. Goodness, on the other hand, has to\ndo with being that is undivided from a final cause, that is, a cause\nthat has to do with goals or ends, especially those goals that have\nbeen brought to fulfillment. Everything has a particular nature, that\nis, properties that make that thing a thing of that type. But things\ncan exemplify those properties to a greater or lesser extent. Philip\nclaims that everything has as its goal its own perfection, which means\nthat things move toward exemplifying their specifying characteristics\nto the greatest extent possible. To the extent that a thing does so,\nthat thing will be good. But that thing will also have being to the\nsame extent. Thus, goodness and being in a given thing coincide in\nreality, and a thing\u2019s goodness adds nothing over and above the\nthing\u2019s being. But of course, goodness and being involve two\ndifferent concepts. Thus, being and goodness have the same extension\nwhile differing intensionally.\n\n\nIt has been argued (by Pouillion and others) that Philip\u2019s\ndiscussion of the transcendentals in Summa de bono represents\nthe earliest formal treatise on the transcendentals in the history of\nWestern philosophy (see Pouillion 1939, Aertsen 2012). About ten years\nearlier, William of Auxerre also discussed the relationship between\nbeing and goodness; he raises the issue of whether being and being\ngood are the same. But in resolving this issue, William never\nconsiders the central issue of the transcendentals, the idea that they\nare extensionally equivalent while intensionally different. It appears\nthat Philip is the first to do so.  MacDonald argues that\nPhilip\u2019s greater familiarity with the metaphysical works of\nAristotle and the Arabic commentators accounts for the startling\ninnovations of his work on the transcendentals (MacDonald 1992). It is\nlikely that Philip encountered the fundamental notion of extensional\nequivalence and intensional difference in the work of the Arabic\ncommentators of Aristotle; both Avicenna and Averroes argue that unity\nand being have the same extension while differing conceptually. Philip\nextends this idea to include not only being and unity, but also the\ntrue and the good. Philip\u2019s work in turn sets the stage for the\ndevelopment of this topic throughout the thirteenth century,\ninfluencing the work of such notable thinkers as Alexander of Hales,\nAlbert the Great, and Thomas Aquinas (see Aertsen 2012).\n5. Philip\u2019s Psychology\n\n\nAlthough not as well known, Philip\u2019s psychology also exhibits\nsome innovative features and influenced later thinkers, in particular,\nAlbert the Great. In the early thirteenth century, theorists accounted\nfor human abilities by arguing that in order to do what they do,\nagents must possess certain capacities or powers. Thus for every\nability, there must be a corresponding and separate power. Human\nbeings have the ability to think; therefore, they must have a\ncognitive power, often called intellect or reason. Medieval\nphilosophers also adopted Aristotle\u2019s distinction between\npractical intellect, which discerns what to do, and speculative\nintellect, which discerns the truth about the way things are. Human\nbeings have the capacity for desire; therefore, they must have\nappetitive powers. Medieval philosophers distinguish between two kinds\nof appetite; a rational appetite, called the will, that is responsive\nto the dictates of the intellect, and an appetite that is responsive\nto sensory apprehension, called the sensory appetite. Since activities\nsuch as thinking and desiring are different sorts of activities, most\ntheorists thought of their corresponding powers, the (practical)\nintellect and the will, as separate. However, on Philip\u2019s\naccount, the practical intellect and the will are not separate powers\n(see McCluskey 2001). He argues that with respect to the capacity for\nperforming actions, there is only one power with two separate acts.\nPhilip gives a number of arguments for this position. One of them is\nparticularly interesting because Philip uses the doctrine of the\ntranscendentals to establish his conclusion that the practical\nintellect and will are one and the same power. Philip first notes that\nthe intellect and the will have different ends. The intellect, even as\npractical intellect, has truth as its goal or end since its job, so to\nspeak, is to ascertain the way things are, to make judgments about the\nstate of reality, including what alternatives for action are available\nfor the agent. The will, on the other hand, is an appetite for the\ngood; it inclines the agent toward what she judges to be good. Thus,\nits end is the good. But according to the doctrine of the\ntranscendentals, the true and the good differ only intensionally, not\nextensionally. Philip thinks that if the ends of the powers do not\ndiffer extensionally, then the powers themselves do not differ\nextensionally as well. Thus, with respect to action, there is only one\npower with two different acts, acts of conceiving and judging on the\none hand, and acts of desiring (the good) and willing on the other.\nTalking about the will is merely shorthand for referring to acts of\nwilling or desiring. Talking about the intellect is merely shorthand\nfor referring to certain cognitive judgments about what to do or how\nto act. \n\n\nAlthough Philip denies that the practical intellect and the will are\nseparate powers, he argues for a distinction among the various\napprehensive powers (McCluskey 2001). Thus, he sees a genuine\ndistinction between the speculative intellect, the practical\nintellect, imagination, and the sensory apprehensive powers. This is\nbecause what is apprehended by each of these powers is different in\nnature. Philip denies that any such distinction is present among\nmotive powers. Insofar as the appetite is moved by a sensory\napprehension, we call it the sensory appetite. Insofar as the appetite\nis moved by the judgment of intellect, we call it the will. However,\nin reality, there is only one motive power to account for both of\nthese sorts of desires, according to Philip. Philip\u2019s position\non the inseparability of practical intellect and will does not appear\nto have convinced his thirteenth-century contemporaries or\nnear-contemporaries. Albert the Great in Summa de homine\n(circa 1245) addresses the arguments given by Philip for his\nposition although as was the custom of the time with respect to\none\u2019s contemporaries or near-contemporaries, he does not refer\nto Philip by name. Albert rejects Philip\u2019s position, but the\nfact that Albert examines the issue at all indicates something about\nthe esteem given to Philip\u2019s work.\n\n\nAn important part of thirteenth-century psychology was the development\nof a theory of free action. This was especially important both for\ntheology and for ethics. Medieval thinkers, beginning with Augustine,\nrecognized that moral responsibility requires freedom and so the\npossibility of that freedom needed to be explained. Along those same\nlines, they argued that unless human beings are able to act freely,\nGod is not justified in punishing sins. Furthermore, human freedom\nplays a major role in theodicy; for example, Augustine argues that God\nis not responsible for the evil found in the world because that evil\nis perpetrated by the free choices of human beings (De lib\narb). Thus, given this background and these commitments, it was\ncommon for medieval philosophers to examine the topic of freedom\nsomewhere in their writings. In the first half of the thirteenth\ncentury, it was customary to examine these issues in the context of a\ntreatise on what became known as liberum arbitrium (see Kent\n1995, McCluskey 2001). In medieval theories of action in the early\npart of the thirteenth century, \u201cliberum\narbitrium\u201d is a technical term. It is a placeholder for\nwhatever it is that enables human beings to act freely. The term\noriginates in the work of Augustine who wrote a treatise\nentitled De libero arbitrio.  The starting point for\nthirteenth-century treatises on liberum arbitrium was a\ndefinition taken from Peter Lombard\u2019s\nSentences: \u201cliberum arbitrium is a faculty of\nreason and will, by which good is chosen with the assistance of grace,\nor evil, when grace is not there to assist. And it is called\n\u2018liberum\u2019 with respect to the will, which can be\nturned toward either [good or bad], while [it is called]\n\u2018arbitrium\u2019 with respect to reason, as it has to\ndo with that power or faculty to which the discerning between good and\nevil belongs.\u201d Although Lombard\u2019s main discussion\nof liberum arbitrium is found in book two, distinction\ntwenty-five of his Sententiae in IV libris distinctae, this\ndefinition is found in the twenty-fourth distinction of book two,\nchapter three. This definition was commonly but mistakenly attributed\nto Augustine by commentators in the thirteenth century. Lombard\nhimself does not reveal his source.  References to Augustine dominate\nhis discussion of liberum arbitrium, which might account for\nthe association of the definition with Augustine.\n\n\nPhilosophers in the early thirteenth century faced the task of how\nto understand this definition. Although it is obvious from Lombard\u2019s\nformulation that both intellect and will have something to do with\nliberum arbitrium, their exact relationship is unclear. The\nphrase \u201cliberum arbitrium\u201d itself contributes to\nthe uncertainty (on this issue, see Korolec 1982, McCluskey 2001). The\nfirst part of the phrase, \u201cliberum,\u201d is\nuncontroversial; it simply means \u201cfree.\u201d Difficulties\narise with respect to the notion of \u201carbitrium.\u201d\nThis notion has both cognitive and appetitive connotations, for it can\nhave meanings as diverse as \u201cjudgment,\u201d\n\u201cdecision,\u201d \u201cwish,\u201d or\n\u201cinclination.\u201d It can also refer to a power or ability to\nmake judgments or decisions or to the very agent who makes these\njudgments or decisions. Thus, the term covers a lot of territory,\nterritory that has to do with both cognitive and appetitive\ncapabilities. Accordingly, it is natural to connect\nliberum arbitrium with both intellect and will. In writing\ntreatises on liberum arbitrium, thirteenth-century\nphilosophers sought to sort out the connections between intellect and\nwill on the one hand and the production and freedom of human action on\nthe other. Some of these philosophers argued that free action results\nfrom the interaction of intellect and will, while others argued that\nalthough the intellect is an important precondition for an action\u2019s\nbeing free, the will is the true instrument that brings about a free\naction. Still others argued that liberum arbitrium is a\nseparate faculty altogether although it is closely linked with and\ninteracts with the intellect and will in the production of a free\naction. The practice of writing treatises on liberum arbitrium\nbegan to die off toward the later decades of the thirteenth century\nwhen philosophers started examining the topic of voluntas\nlibera (free will) instead (see Kent 1995, Lottin 1957).\n\n\nIn his treatise on liberum arbitrium in Summa de\nbono, Philip adopts John Damascene\u2019s basic description of action.\nAccording to Damascene, an eighth-century patristic, a number of\ndifferent stages come together in the production of an action. These\nstages include desiring, considering the various courses of action that\nwill satisfy one\u2019s desires, deliberating over those courses of action,\njudging which one is to be performed, willing and choosing a particular\nalternative, and initiating the action. Since each of these activities\nare activities of the will or of the intellect, it follows that actions\nresult from the activities of the will and the intellect. Damascene\nalso claims that each of these stages are performed freely. Because\neach stage is performed freely, the resulting action is also free.\n\n\nPhilip modifies this position (McCluskey 2001). He thinks that only\nthe final activity of the intellect is performed freely, that is, the\nfinal judgment about what course of action to take. This is because\nPhilip thinks that with respect to the previous activities of the\nintellect, activities such as identifying possible courses of action\nand deliberating over them, the intellect suffers from certain\nconstraints.  These constraints have to do with the structure of the\nworld around us which in turn structures our beliefs. Beliefs play a\nrole in our deliberations over what to do; thus the constraints placed\nupon beliefs in turn constrain the intellect in its activities. But\naccording to Philip, the intellect retains some freedom for the final\njudgment about what to do is made freely. Thus, the intellect need not\njudge that a particular course of action be performed; it could have\njudged differently. In Philip\u2019s view, the will does not suffer\nfrom such constraints. The will is an appetite for the good so that\nwhatever it wills, it wills a good. But a thing\u2019s being a good\nis merely a necessary condition, not a sufficient one. A thing\u2019s\nbeing good does not compel the will\u2019s act. Moreover, no judgment\nof the intellect constrains the will\u2019s choice; the will is free\neither to will the alternative put forth by the intellect or to reject\nit and will something else. It is because of this capacity of the will\nthat Philip sees the will as the primary source of freedom in a human\nbeing. For in the final analysis, it is the will rather than the\njudgment of the intellect that determines the action the agent\nperforms. Because the will wills freely, the agent performs the action\nfreely. Thus, while both intellect and will have important roles to\nplay in the production of a free action, freedom is primarily a\nfunction of the will. Philip\u2019s theory of action helps to set the\nstage for the prominent voluntarist movement that rose later in the\nthirteenth century with thinkers such as Peter John Olivi and John\nDuns Scotus (see Kent 1995, McCluskey 2001).\n6. Philip\u2019s Discussion of Time and Eternity\n\n\nPhilip does not interpret his organizing principle of the good in an\nunduly narrow or restrictive manner. Among the goods of nature he\nconsiders not to be diminishable by evil are time and eternity. After\na discussion of whether good and evil are contraries and whether evil\ncan be a principle or a genus, Philip launches into a discussion of\nwhether the world is eternal and follows that by a comparison of time\nand eternity. The topic of eternity is one of some importance and was\nmuch discussed in the Middle Ages. Medieval philosophers in the\nChristian tradition to which Philip belonged believed that the world\nwas created\nex nihilo by God with a beginning and at some point in time\nwill end. It soon became apparent that the newly rediscovered Aristotle\ndid not share this commitment as he famously argues that the world is\neternal. Thus, this was an issue that medieval philosophers needed to\naddress.\n\n\nPhilip attempts to reconcile Aristotle\u2019s position with his own\ncommitments first by distinguishing the domain of philosophy from the\ndomain of theology, an approach that will appeal to later thinkers as\nwell (see Dales 1990). Not surprisingly, Philip argues that Aristotle\nshould be taken as a philosopher and not as a theologian. But Philip\nalso tries to reinterpret Aristotle\u2019s position so that it will\nbe compatible with his Christian commitments. He argues that strictly\nspeaking, Aristotle\u2019s argument establishes only that the world\nis perpetual, not that it is eternal (see Yarbrough 2015). Philip\ndefines the perpetual as that which is measured in the whole of time\nand mobility. Eternity, on the other hand, is such that it has no\nbeginning and will have no end. Thus, Philip\u2019s concept of the\nperpetual is compatible with the view that what is perpetual has a\nbeginning and an end. The world could have existed for all of time,\nbut since Philip thinks that time has a beginning and will at some\npoint have an end, such an understanding of the world is compatible\nwith the Christian doctrine of creation. Philip also defends his\nposition by arguing that Aristotle\u2019s task is to show that time,\nmotion, and what is movable are all co-equal and that it is not\nappropriate to the discipline of philosophy to demonstrate anything\nbeyond this claim.  Finally, Philip draws upon Averroes (referring to\nhim as the Commentator) to support his claim. He argues that according\nto Averroes\u2019 commentary on the eleventh book of\nAristotle\u2019s\nMetaphysics, Aristotle is describing the origin of motion from\nthe first mover. Thus, Aristotle is not discussing the origin of the\nworld as such, but rather what takes place once the world exists.\n\n\nIn his comparison between time and eternity, Philip argues that both\nhave duration and as a result are contained in the same genus. But\ntime differs significantly from eternity in a number of important\nrespects.  First, time has a beginning and an end while eternity does\nnot.  Secondly, time by nature has succession and thus, motion, while\neternity does not; it is entirely immobile and immutable. In fact,\nPhilip argues that eternity and the divine essence are the same in\nreality although conceptually distinct. Time of course for Philip is\nsomething created and so cannot be identified with God\u2019s\nessence, which is wholly uncreated. Finally although both time and\neternity involve the idea of \u201cnow,\u201d they do so in\ndifferent respects. The \u201cnow\u201d involves the past and the\nfuture, while the \u201cnow\u201d of time is defined by or comes\nabout in virtue of the past and the future.\n\n\nPhilip also considers the relationship between time and eternity. He\nis concerned with Plato\u2019s position, which he quotes, that\n\u201ctime is a part of eternity.\u201d This is a claim that Philip\nwishes to deny. Although time and eternity are found in the same\ngenus, they differ in character, as I noted above. Philip appeals to\nBoethius\u2019s definition of eternity from The Consolation of\nPhilosophy: \u201cEternity is the possession of unending life,\nwholly present and perfected.\u201d Philip argues that the notion of\n\u201cwholly present\u201d removes the idea of succession from the\nconcept of eternity while the notion of \u201cwholly perfected\u201d\nremoves the idea of division into parts from the concept of\neternity. Succession and division into parts are of course part of the\nnotion of time. Thus, it is incompatible with the nature of eternity\nthat time be a part of it. Rather, Philip views them as two separate\ndurations, each differing in character. No doubt Philip\u2019s\npositions on time and eternity and his interpretation of Aristotle\nraise a number of pressing questions and objections, but as Dales\nnotes, his distinctions greatly influenced thinkers later in the\nthirteenth and fourteenth centuries (Dales 1990).\n",
