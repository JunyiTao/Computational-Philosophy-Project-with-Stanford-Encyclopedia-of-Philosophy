    "main_text": "Arguments for Narrow Content || Arguments from Introspective Access\n3.2 Arguments from Introspective Access\n\nA somewhat different motivation for narrow content (Loar 1988) appeals\nto the idea that we have introspective access to the contents of our\nown thoughts. In particular, it seems that we should be able to\ndetermine introspectively whether two of our thoughts have the same\ncontent or not. But the kind of difference in content that\ndistinguishes Oscar\u2019s thoughts from Twin Oscar\u2019s thoughts\nseems to be the sort of difference that they could not in principle be\nintrospectively aware of. From the inside, so to speak, there is no\nway for Oscar and Twin Oscar to tell whether they are thinking\nXYZ-thoughts or H2O-thoughts. (Recall that they are unaware\nof what the microstructure of the substance they call\n\u201cwater\u201d is, although they assume that it has one.) The\ndifference in broad content between the beliefs of Oscar and Twin\nOscar seems to be a difference to which they themselves have no\naccess.\n\nIt is difficult to formulate this point precisely, however. For\ninstance, Oscar can think that water is wet and then think the\nmeta-level thought, \u201cthat thought I just had was about\nwater!\u201d, referring thereby to H2O and thus\nexpressing the very aspect of his original thought which distinguishes\nhis content from Twin Oscar\u2019s. Since neither Oscar nor Twin\nOscar has thoughts about the substance his twin has thoughts about, it\nis not clear what it means to say that they cannot introspectively\ndistinguish between these different thoughts. One way to try to\nclarify and reinforce the argument is to consider the phenomenon of\n\u201cslow switching\u201d (introduced in Burge 1988, and used by\nBoghossian 1989 to pose difficulties for self-knowledge). Suppose\nOscar moves to Twin Earth. Initially his water-thoughts will continue\nto be about water, but it seems that gradually, the longer he\ninteracts with XYZ and the longer he is out of touch with\nH2O, his thoughts will come to be about XYZ rather than\nH2O. If this is correct, then his\n\u2018water\u2019-thoughts will have come over time to have a\ndifferent broad content than they previously had. However, this change\nin content will be completely invisible to Oscar himself. From his own\nsubjective point of view, his thoughts appear to have exactly the same\ncontent as before. If there is a kind of mental content to which we\nhave introspective access, and if introspective access must include\nthe ability to recognize when contents are the same or different, then\nthe sort of content to which we have introspective access cannot be\nbroad content. This suggests that we need a concept of narrow content\nto capture the kind of content that we are immediately aware of.\n\nBurge\u2019s response to this sort of argument is to accept that we\nhave introspective knowledge of the contents of our own thoughts, but\ndeny that this entails that we can tell introspectively whether two\ncontents are the same or different (Burge 1988). In response, some\nsuggest that knowing that my thought is about water requires ruling\nout relevant alternative possibilities, and that in slow switching\ncases the possibility that my thought is instead about XYZ is in fact\na relevant alternative that we cannot rule out.
