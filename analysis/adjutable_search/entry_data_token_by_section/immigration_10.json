    "main_text": "Arguments for Open Borders || Libertarianism\n2.2 Libertarianism\n\n\nWhen one thinks of the individual rights which conflict with a\nstate\u2019s control over immigration, an outsider\u2019s right to\nfreedom of movement is likely to come to mind. As Joseph Carens\nreminds us, though, the rights of insiders are also limited when the\npolitical community as a whole has dominion over immigration. As\nhe explains, \u201cSuppose a farmer from the United States wanted to\nhire workers from Mexico. The government would have no right to\nprohibit him from doing this. To prevent the Mexicans from coming\nwould violate the rights of both the American farmer and the Mexican\nworkers to engage in voluntary transactions.\u201d (Carens 1987:\n253) Thus, a state\u2019s exclusive immigration policy is doubly\ndisrespectful of individual rights, because it interferes with both an\noutsider\u2019s freedom of movement and an insider\u2019s property\nright to unilaterally invite foreigners onto her land.\n\n\nThe libertarian is right to suggest that a state\u2019s dominion over\nimmigration is inconsistent with individuals having unlimited rights\nin this domain, but it is not clear why we should presume that the\nindividual\u2019s right must always prevail. Certainly the\nstate\u2019s right would be over-ridden if individual rights were\nalways perfectly general and absolute, but this construal of moral\nrights is implausible. A person\u2019s right to freedom of movement\ndoes not give her the right to enter my house without my permission,\nfor instance, so why must we assume that it gives her a right to enter\nmy country\u2019s territory without first getting the permission of\nthe political community as a whole? One could make a similar point\nabout a property owner\u2019s rights over her land. A property owner\nwould have the right to unilaterally invite foreigners onto her land\nif property rights were general and absolute, but most eschew this\naccount of property. Few would say that each property owner has a\nright to unilaterally enforce the criminal law on her own land, for\ninstance, and if property owners must defer to the state as a whole\nwhen it comes to the enforcement of criminal law, why must it be any\ndifferent for the immigration of foreigners?\n",
