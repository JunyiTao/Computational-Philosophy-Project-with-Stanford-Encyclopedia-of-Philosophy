    "main_text": "Cognitive Theory || Knowledge and Science\n6.3 Knowledge and Science\n\nAquinas uses a variety of terms to talk about knowledge, including\nscientia, cognitio and notitia. Often he\nseems to use these terms interchangeably, and he shows no interest in\ntrying to define anything like knowledge in its loose and popular\nsense. He is, however, very much interested in articulating what it\nwould be to have an ideal grasp of some subject, and he refers to such\na thing, speaking strictly, as scientia. This is what both\nthe theologian and the philosopher seek, which is to say that this is\nwhat Aquinas himself seeks. Each of these fields, theology and\nphilosophy, can be described as a single complex\nscientia\u2014that is, as a science. We can also refer to\nthe myriad individual conclusions obtained in these fields as\nscientiae\u2014that is, as items of scientific knowledge.\nPhilosophy itself, moreover, can be divided into various discrete\nfields of science: logic, physics, astronomy, biology, metaphysics,\nethics, and so on. Until the seventeenth century the physical sciences\nwere understood to be contained, in this way, within the field of\nphilosophy. Accordingly, the domains of scientia, conceived\nmost widely, were philosophy and theology.\n\nThe fundamentals of Aquinas\u2019s thinking about knowledge in this\nideal sense come from Aristotle\u2019s Posterior Analytics.\nIn particular, he takes the discussion in Book I chapter 2 to offer a\ndefinition of scientia (in Greek,\nepist\u0113m\u0113), which in his commentary he articulates\nas follows (quotations are from Comm. Post. An. I.4):\n\n\u201cto have scientia of something is to cognize it\nperfectly\u201d;\nto have scientia requires grasping the cause of the thing\nknown;\n\u201cscientia is a cognition with certainty of a\nthing\u201d;\nthe object of scientia is true and \u201ccannot stand\notherwise\u201d;\n\u201cto have scientia is the end or effect of a\ndemonstrative syllogism\u201d;\nthe premises of such a syllogism must be \u201ctrue, primary, and\nimmediate\u201d and must be \u201cbetter known, prior, and causes of\nthe conclusion\u201d;\nsuch premises must concern the universal natures of things.\n\n\nEach of these bullet points raises a host of further questions, but,\nin broad outline, Aquinas understands scientia as the\napprehension, with certainty, of an entity, event or proposition,\nbased on a demonstrative proof grounded in the essential nature of the\nthing in question. As befits intellectual understanding (\u00a76.2),\nscientia will concern universal truths. Because it concerns\nthe essences of things, it will concern necessary truths and will get\nat the underlying cause of a thing\u2019s being so (MacDonald\n1993).\n\nEventually, the demand that premises be \u201cbetter known\u201d\nleads back to the first principles of the science, which are\nself-evident (per se nota) in the sense that they are known\nto be true simply in virtue of their terms (Comm. Post.\nAnalytics I.7.8). Nothing could be better known than such a\nprinciple, but because these principles are self-evident there is also\nno need for any further demonstration. Each science has its own\nstarting points\u2014its own first principles\u2014which are not\nsusceptible to demonstration within that science. But not all such\nfirst principles are strictly self-evident. Within physics, for\ninstance, it is a first principle that there is motion, but that is\nneither absolutely necessary nor strictly self-evident. Accordingly,\nagain following Aristotle, Aquinas orders the various sciences\naccording to relations of \u201csubalternation\u201d, such that\nbiology is subalternate to physics, and physics to metaphysics. In\ngeneral, \u201cthe principles of a lower science are proved by the\nprinciples of a higher science\u201d (Comm. Post. Analytics\nI.17.5). Among the natural speculative sciences\u2014that is, setting\ntheology and ethics aside\u2014the preeminent science is metaphysics,\nor first philosophy, \u201cfrom which all the other sciences follow,\ntaking their principles from it\u201d (Comm. Boethius De\ntrin. 5.1c). (On the structure of the sciences see Maurer 1986;\nWippel 1995a; Dougherty 2004.)\n\nThis sort of foundationalist, infallibilist theory of knowledge is now\nthought of as Cartesian, but\n Descartes\n is simply following the Aristotelian tradition for which Aquinas\nbecame the preeminent spokesman. For Aquinas himself, however, the\naccount just described serves as an aspirational ideal rather than a\ndescription of something we have actually attained. In practice, even\nwhere we have demonstrative knowledge, we usually cannot trace the\nprinciples all the way back to ultimate first principles like the law\nof non-contradiction. Critical questions, like the non-eternity of the\nworld (\u00a73), are contingent on the free choice of God and so have\nto be taken on faith. Even in places where certainty is possible in\nprinciple, large gaps in our knowledge remain. In general, \u201cour\ncognition is so weak that no philosopher could have ever completely\ninvestigated the nature of a single fly\u201d (On the\nApostles\u2019 Creed [Collatio in symbolum\nApostolorum], proem). Accordingly, Aquinas distinguishes among\nvarious non-ideal cases. A demonstration that grasps the cause of a\nthing is a demonstration propter quid, but often\u2014as in\nproving God\u2019s existence\u2014the best we can have is a\ndemonstration quia, which tells us only that a thing\nis so. Much of what we know holds true only for the most part, and so\nfails to be necessary, and often the premises of an argument cannot be\ntraced back to self-evident principles, in which case our argument is\ndialectical rather than demonstrative, yielding a conclusion\nthat is merely plausible (probabilis) rather than\napodictic.\n\nIn all of this, Aquinas is following Aristotle and the later\nAristotelian tradition fairly closely, and thus the framework for\nscience and knowledge just sketched comes to be commonly accepted by\nthe later scholastic tradition all the way into the seventeenth\ncentury.\n",
