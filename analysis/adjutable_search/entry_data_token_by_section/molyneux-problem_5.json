Conclusion\n\nThe history of the issues surrounding Molyneux\u2019s question shows\nthat the question was not as easy to answer as Molyneux himself may\nhave assumed. On the contrary, there is no problem in the history of\nthe philosophy of perception that has provoked more thought than the\nproblem that Molyneux raised in 1688. In this sense, Molyneux\u2019s\nproblem is one the most fruitful thought-experiments ever proposed in\nthe history of philosophy, which is still as intriguing today as when\nMolyneux first formulated it more than three centuries ago.\n",
