    "main_text": "Proto-Metaphysical Background: The Mandate of Heaven\n2. Proto-Metaphysical Background: The Mandate of Heaven\n\nAs far as we know, explicit metaphysical discussions began in China in\nthe mid to late 4th century BCE with the Laozi\n(Daodejing) and associated texts. Before that, the two\ndominant philosophical movements were the Mohists and the Confucians\n(Ru). Both focused on political and ethical issues and showed little\ndirect concern with metaphysical questions, but their discussions of\nthe divine set the context for the emergence of metaphysical\ndebates.\n\nThe two most relevant concepts are tian \u5929 (heaven) and\nming \u547d (the command; fate). The idea of\ntianming \u5929\u547d (the \u201cMandate of\nHeaven\u201d) first came to prominence in rationalizing the conquest\nof the Shang dynasty by King Wen and King Wu, who founded the Zhou\ndynasty in the eleventh century BCE. Heaven is described in\nanthropomorphic terms as having awareness, preferences, and values.\nIts most fundamental concern is for the people, as expressed in a\nfamous line from the \u201cGreat Declaration\u201d chapter of the\nBook of Documents (Shangshu \u5c1a\u66f8):\n\u201cHeaven sees from where my people see; heaven hears from where\nmy people hear\u201d (quoted from Mengzi 5A5). As a\npolitical doctrine, the claim is that heaven will support rulers who\nhelp the people and will bring disaster on rulers who do not. On this\nview, the world works on consistent patterns that encompass ethical\nand political concerns. Human beings determine their own success or\nfailure based on these patterns rather than depending on divine whim.\nThe emergence of this view is commonly seen as a decisive moment in\nthe formation of Chinese philosophy.\n\nWhile heaven is presented as willful and anthropomorphic in the early\nparts of the Shangshu \u5c1a\u66f8, it was not\ntranscendent in the sense of being external to the system of nature.\nThe term tian simultaneously refers to the sky, the orderly\nmovement of the heavens, and something that covers all things equally.\nThe classical Chinese word for the \u201cworld\u201d or\n\u201crealm\u201d is literally what is \u201cunder-heaven\u201d,\ntianxia \u5929\u4e0b. Since the actions of heaven occur\nthrough the world, the two are often difficult to distinguish. The\nprimary expression of heaven\u2019s will is through human\nactions\u2014to lose heaven\u2019s mandate is to lose their support.\nThe eventual transition in conceptions of heaven from a willful deity\nto the causal patterns of nature was possible because heaven was never\nseparate from those patterns. Debates were about the nature of heaven\nrather than its existence, and heaven remained a central term for\nphilosophers holding widely different viewpoints.\n\nThe belief that heaven supported good rulers and punished the bad came\ninto question as the Zhou dynasty fell apart. Something like the\nclassical problem of evil arose as centuries of civil war and disaster\nmade it difficult to believe that the world was structured along\nethical lines (Perkins 2014). Three responses to this crisis can be\ndistinguished. One, exemplified by the Mohists, defended and theorized\nthe earlier view that heaven rewarded those who are good, defined as\nthose who care inclusively for other people. The second emphasized\nthat good and bad events come without reason and without concern for\njustice. This view was associated with a new meaning for\nming, taking it not as a command but as something more like\nblind fate. The third position argued for the regularity of natural\npatterns but took those patterns as amoral. On this view, human beings\nremain in control of their fate, but what brings success is not\nethical action, at least in a conventional sense. Versions of this\nview appears in the Laozi and in theories arising from\npractical arts like medicine or military strategy. While expressed in\ndifferent ways in different times, the belief that nature follows\nconsistent patterns that can guide human action became a dominant view\nacross Chinese philosophies, while the relationship between these\npatterns and humanistic values became one of the main points of\ndispute.\n",
