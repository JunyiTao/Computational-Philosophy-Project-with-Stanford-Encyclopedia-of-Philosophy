However, we need this level of mathematical rigor to\ndevelop Cantor\u2019s theory of ordinals and cardinals, which are\nwidely regarded as the most significant mathematical advance in our\nunderstanding of the infinite.\n\nAn insomniac, counting imaginary sheep to try to get to sleep, will\nnever run out of natural numbers to do the job: 1, 2, 3, \u2026.\nThere is no bound on the set of natural numbers. This is our first\ninfinite set. It is perhaps a natural thought that there is just one\ninfinity for counting infinite sets, which we might symbolise\n\u2018\\(\\infty\\)\u2019. The thought may seem even more natural when\nwe define an infinite set as one that has the same size (in a\nsense to be made precise shortly) as a proper subset of it. In fact,\nthe thought could hardly be more mistaken: as we will soon see,\naccording to mathematical orthodoxy\u2014namely contemporary set\ntheory and the attendant notion of cardinality of a set\u2014there\nare infinitely many infinities. This prompts a series of\nquestions: Is there a smallest one? Yes, as we will see. Is there a\nlargest one? No, as we will see. What can be said about the spacing\nbetween the infinities and how far infinities extend? Well, we will\nsee. We can also ask parallel questions about the infinitely\nsmall.\n\nRecall Galileo\u2019s paradox of infinity, based on the collision of\nthe part-whole intuition and the bijection intuition, and his\nconclusion that one cannot apply the relations of \u2018less\nthan\u2019, \u2018equality\u2019, and \u2018greater than\u2019 to\ninfinite collections. Modern mathematical orthodoxy, embodied in\ncontemporary set theory, rejects Galileo\u2019s conclusion. That\northodoxy is grounded in the bijection intuition, following Cantor\nrather than Euclid and Bolzano. When there is a bijection between two\nsets, we say that they have the same cardinality. The notion\nof cardinality does not respect the part-whole intuition. For example,\nthe squares of natural numbers are a proper subset of the natural\nnumbers, but they have the same cardinality since they can be put in\none-to-one correspondence.\n\nFoundational programs such as neo-logicism also start from a notion of\n\u201cequinumerosity\u201d based on the Cantorian bijection\nintuition. It was not until the early 2000s that a group of\nmathematicians working on non-standard analysis (Benci, di Nasso, and\nForti) developed a theory of \u201cnumerosities\u201d that agrees on\nfinite sets with Cantorian cardinality but that also upholds the\npart-whole intuition for infinite sets, and thus diverges from\nCantorian cardinalities. (See Benci and Di Nasso 2003, 2019; Benci, Di\nNasso and Forti 2006, 2007). One can consider numerosities as a\nrefinement of Cantorian cardinalities. Every two sets that have the\nsame numerosity have the same cardinality, but the converse does not\nhold. For instance, in this approach the set of squares has numerosity\nstrictly less than the set of natural numbers. See the\n\nSupplement on Theories of Numerosities.\n3.3.2 Set theory: \\(\\omega\\) and \\(\\aleph\\)\n\nThe sort of infinities that are most familiar to philosophers are\ninfinities used for counting. In the early 1820s, Bolzano arrived at\nthe idea that an infinite set is one for which there is a bijection\nbetween the set and a proper subset of it. (Recall Galileo\u2019s\nparadox.) Dedekind (1884) gave this as a definition of being\ninfinite. It is easy to prove that a Dedekind-infinite set must\ncontain a set that is just as large as the natural numbers. See\nthe\n\nSupplement on Proofs of Theorems.\n\nDedekind\u2019s definition is only one among several alternative\ndefinitions of infinite set (and correspondingly of finite set) that\nhave been proposed by him and after him. If one assumes the Axiom of\nChoice, these alternative definitions turn out to be equivalent. (This\naxiom says that for every set \\(A\\) of pairwise-disjoint non-empty\nsets, there exists a function that selects exactly one element from\neach set in \\(A\\).) But without the Axiom of Choice, the definitions\ncan be shown not to be equivalent and the foundational situation is\nrather delicate but well understood (see Moore 1982).\n\nThe modern theory of infinities of counting derives from Cantor\n(1932). He observed that a natural way to set up a bijection between\nfinite sets is to order the elements of each set, and pair the first\nelement of one set with the first of the other, the second of one set\nwith the second of the other, and so on. This sometimes works with\ninfinite sets\u2014for example, it gives the one-to-one\ncorrespondence between the natural numbers and the squares (considered\nunder their standard ordering). When there is a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between two sets, such that every pair of elements of\none set bears the same ordering as the corresponding pair of elements\nof the other set, the two ordered sets are said to have the same\norder type.\n\nBut for some infinite sets (notably the set of all integers,\nincluding the negative numbers, and also the set of rational numbers)\nthere is no first element under their standard ordering. In this case,\nit is possible to re-order the elements of the set so that every\nnon-empty subset has a first element, so that this process works. Such\nan ordering is called a well-ordering. (That every\nset can be well-ordered is, as Zermelo famously proved in 1904,\nequivalent to the Axiom of Choice.)\n\nWe can reorder the integers, alternating between positive and\nnegative: 0, -1, 1, -2, 2, -3, 3, \u2026. This ordering has the same\norder type as the natural numbers, and thus enables a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between the natural numbers and the integers. One of\nCantor\u2019s most striking early observations is that the same is\npossible with the positive rational numbers. Every positive rational\nnumber can be written uniquely in lowest terms as some fraction\n\\(p/q\\), where \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are positive integers with no common\nfactor. We can then order these fractions by first comparing the sum\n\\(p+q\\) of numerator and denominator, and then if the sum is equal for\ntwo fractions, put the one with lower numerator \\(p\\) first. This\nordering begins 1, 1/2, 2, 1/3, 3, 1/4, 2/3, 3/2, 4, 1/5, 5, 1/6, 2/5,\n3/4, 4/3, 5/2, 6, \u2026. (Note that fractions like 2/2, 2/4, 3/3,\n4/2, are missing from this list, because they are not written in\nlowest terms.) Every positive rational number must appear in this list\n(because it can be written in lowest terms with some particular finite\nsum of numerator and denominator), and only has finitely many\npredecessors (because there are at most \\(n+1\\) fractions whose sum of\nnumerator and denominator is \\(n\\)).\n\n\n\nThe ordering: 1, 1/2, 2, 1/3, 3, 1/4, 2/3, 3/2, \u2026. Every\nrational number is eventually included.\n\n\nHowever, Cantor also observed that different well-orderings of the\nsame infinite sets will produce a different order type. For instance,\nwe can define an ordering on the integers where every non-negative\ninteger comes before every negative integer, with any two integers of\nthe same sign being ordered by their absolute value. To approximately\nrepresent this ordering we could write it as \\(0, 1, 2, 3, \\dots, -1,\n-2, -3, \\dots\\). In this ordering, every non-empty subset still has a\nfirst element (the non-negative element of lowest absolute value if it\ncontains any non-negative elements, and the negative element of lowest\nabsolute value if it only contains negative elements). If we pair up\nthe first element of this ordering with the first of the standard\nordering on the natural numbers, and the second with the second, and\nthe third with the third, and so on, then the negative integers would\nnot be paired with any natural number. But we can put the natural\nnumbers into the same order type by declaring the odd numbers to be\nbefore the even numbers, and ordering them by size within these two\nsets: \\(1, 3, 5, \\dots, 0, 2, 4, \\dots\\). A single infinite set can be\ngiven orderings of many different order types, and also different\norderings of the same order type (for instance if we put the even\nnumbers first and the odd numbers second).\n\nCantor noted that for any two well-ordered sets, the initial positions\nin one ordering (the first, the second, the third, etc.) correspond to\nthe initial positions in the other, the way that they do for finite\nsets. In fact, he showed that all of the positions of one\nwell-ordering must correspond to initial positions in the other. (If\nthis weren\u2019t true, then the set of positions in one that\ndon\u2019t correspond to positions in the other would be non-empty\nfor each set, and the first elements of these sets would correspond,\nwhich would contradict the claim that these positions don\u2019t\ncorrespond.) Thus, there is a single list of all the possible\npositions in well-ordered sets, beginning with the first, second,\nthird, and so on, and these positions are called the ordinal\nnumbers. A well-ordered set can be said to have its own ordinal\nnumber, which is the first ordinal number that does not correspond to\na position in that set.\n\nA cardinal number (like \u201cone\u201d, \u201ctwo\u201d,\n\u201cthree\u201d)\u2014also called a\ncardinality\u2014represents how many elements a set has. Two\nsets have the same cardinal number if it is possible to come up with\nany correspondence at all between the members of one and the members\nof the other, even if this correspondence fails to respect the\nordering or any other structure of the sets. Two finite sets\nhave the same cardinal number if and only if they have the same\nordinal number. For infinite sets, if they are well-ordered and have\nthe same ordinal number, then they have the same cardinal number\n(because two sets well-ordered with the same order type have a unique\ncorrespondence between elements in corresponding positions of the\nordering). But they may have the same cardinal number without having\nthe same ordinal number: we have seen that sets of one cardinality can\nbe represented with many different order types.\n\nCantor used lowercase Greek letters to represent infinite ordinal\nnumbers, with \\(\\omega\\) representing the order type of the standard\nordering of the natural numbers. Addition of ordinal numbers\ncorresponds to the order type that results from taking an ordering of\nthe first type, followed by an ordering of the second type. Thus,\n\\(\\omega+\\omega\\) represents the order type of the integers with the\nnon-negative numbers first and the negative numbers afterwards, while\n\\(\\omega+1\\) represents the order type of the natural numbers with\njust one element put at the end. Note that \\(1+\\omega\\) is the order\ntype of a single element, followed by a copy of the natural numbers,\nwhich is in fact the same as the order type of the natural numbers!\nThus, \\(1+\\omega=\\omega\\), which is not equal to \\(\\omega+1\\). So\nordinal addition is not commutative.\n\nVon Neumann (1923) defined a canonical representation of ordinal\nnumbers, using the fact that the ordinals are themselves well-ordered.\nEach ordinal is represented by the set consisting of all smaller\nordinals. Thus 0 is represented by the empty set \\(\\emptyset\\), 1 by\nthe set containing the empty set \\(\\{\\emptyset\\}\\), 2 by the set\ncontaining both of those \\(\\{\\emptyset,\\{\\emptyset\\}\\}\\), and so on.\n\\(\\omega\\) is then the set containing all of these finite ordinals\n\\(\\{\\emptyset,\\{\\emptyset\\},\\{\\emptyset,\\{\\emptyset\\}\\},\\dots\\}\\),\n\\(\\omega+1\\) is the set containing it as well\n\\(\\{\\emptyset,\\{\\emptyset\\},\\{\\emptyset,\\{\\emptyset\\}\\},\\dots,\\omega\\}\\),\nand so on.\n\nMultiplication of ordinal numbers corresponds to replacing each\nelement of the second ordering by an entire ordering of the first\ntype. \\(\\omega\\cdot\\omega\\) represents the order type of an\n\\(\\omega\\)-sequence of \\(\\omega\\)-sequences, which we can have by\ntaking the positive rational numbers and sorting them first by\ndenominator, and then by numerator: 1, 2, 3, \u2026 1/2, 3/2, 5/2,\n\u2026, 1/3, 2/3, 4/3, 5/3, \u2026, 1/4, 3/4, 5/4, \u2026. Note\nthat \\(\\omega\\cdot 2\\) is 2 copies of \\(\\omega\\), while\n\\(2\\cdot\\omega\\) is \\(\\omega\\) copies of 2. \\(\\omega\\cdot 2\\) is thus\n\\(\\omega+\\omega\\), while \\(2\\cdot\\omega\\) is \\(2+2+2+\\dots\\), which is\n\\(\\omega\\). (This is the difference between the orderings 1, 2, 3,\n\u2026, \u22121, \u22122, \u22123, \u2026 and 1, \u22121, 2,\n\u22122, 3, \u22123, \u2026.) So again, ordinal multiplication is\nnot commutative.\n\n\n\n\nBut for any ordinal, one can generate another ordinal by putting one\nmore element at the end. And for any increasing sequence of ordinals,\nthere is a limit of that sequence. Cantor also defined a notion of\nexponentiation for ordinals, and this gives many different ordinal\nnumbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, \u2026 ,\\(\\omega,\\) \\(\\omega+1,\\) \\(\\omega+2,\\)\n\u2026, \\(\\omega+\\omega(=\\omega\\cdot 2),\\) \\(\\omega\\cdot 2+1,\\)\n\\(\\omega\\cdot 2+2, \\dots,\\) \\(\\omega\\cdot 3,\\) \\(\\omega\\cdot 4,\\)\n\u2026, \\(\\omega\\cdot \\omega(=\\omega^2),\\) \u2026, \\(\\omega^3,\\)\n\u2026, \\(\\omega^4,\\) \u2026, \\(\\omega^\\omega,\\)\n\\(\\omega^{\\omega+1},\\) \\(\\omega^{\\omega+2},\\) \u2026,\n\\(\\omega^{\\omega\\cdot\\omega}=\\omega^{\\omega^2},\\) \u2026,\n\\(\\omega^{\\omega^3},\\) \u2026, \\(\\omega^{\\omega^\\omega},\\)\n\\(\\epsilon_0\\) (defined as the limit ordinal for the sequence\n\\(\\omega,\\) \\(\\omega^\\omega,\\) \\(\\omega^{\\omega^\\omega},\\) \u2026).\nBut these ordinal numbers all correspond to the same cardinal number,\nwhich is that of the natural numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point, one might be forgiven for thinking that there is no\ncardinal number greater than that of the natural numbers, just as\nthere is no extended real number larger than \\(+\\infty\\). However,\nCantor\u2019s second striking result is that the cardinality of the\npositive real numbers is in fact greater than the cardinality of the\npositive integers, and his third striking result is that for every\nset, the set of all its subsets\u2014its power set\u2014has an even\ngreater cardinality. Although many different infinite sets of\ndifferent order types can all be put into one-to-one correspondence\nwith each other, there are some infinite sets that cannot. Sets whose\ncardinality is equal to that of the natural numbers (like the integers\nand the rationals) are said to be countably infinite or\ndenumerable, while infinite sets that are not countable (like\nthe reals, and the power set of the naturals) are said to be\nuncountable. See proofs of the results in the\n\nSupplement on Proofs of Theorems.\n\nThus, just as there is an infinite hierarchy of infinite ordinal\nnumbers, which Cantor represented with lowercase Greek letters, there\nis also an infinite hierarchy of infinite cardinal numbers, which\nCantor represented with Hebrew letters, and in particular aleph,\n\u201c\\(\\aleph\\)\u201d. The finite cardinals are 0, 1, 2, 3,\n\u2026. The first infinite cardinal, that of the natural numbers\n(and all countable sets), is \\(\\aleph_0\\). Cantor\u2019s\n\u201cwell-ordering principle\u201d, stating that every set can be\nput into some well-ordered form (and equivalent to the Axiom of\nChoice), implies that every cardinal number can be represented by an\nordinal number, and the definition of ordinal numbers ensures that for\nany non-empty set of ordinal numbers there is always a first. So the\ncardinals must in fact be well-ordered. So Cantor used ordinal numbers\nto designate each cardinal\u2019s position in their ordering.\n\\(\\aleph_1\\) is the first cardinal beyond \\(\\aleph_0\\), \\(\\aleph_2\\)\nis the next beyond that, and after \\(\\aleph_3\\), \\(\\aleph_4\\), and so\non, we eventually reach \\(\\aleph_\\omega\\), \\(\\aleph_{\\omega+1}\\),\n\\(\\aleph_{\\omega+2}\\), and so on with one cardinal for every\nordinal.\n\nBecause we have this one-to-one correspondence between the cardinals\nand the ordinals, one might be tempted to say that the set of\ncardinals and the set of ordinals have the same order type, and then\nask what the ordinal of this order type (and its cardinality) is.\nHowever, if there were such an ordinal, there would be a\nparadox\u2014it would have to contain, and thus be larger than, all\nordinals, including itself! This is the Burali-Forti paradox\n(see entry\n paradoxes and contemporary logic).\n\nRelatedly, since every set has a cardinality less than that of its\npower set, there can be no set that contains everything (since such a\nset would already include all its subsets, and thus be at least as\nlarge as its power set). The two results imply that there cannot be a\nset of all ordinals or a set of all sets. In a similar way one argues\nthat there cannot be a set of all cardinals. As a consequence of the\nabove results we can also answer some of the questions we raised at\nthe beginning: there are infinitely many cardinal numbers and\ninfinitely many ordinal numbers. However, there is neither a set of\nall cardinal numbers nor a set of all ordinal numbers. Thus, the\ninfinity of the cardinals and of the ordinals cannot be measured by a\ncardinal or an ordinal, for otherwise a paradox would ensue. (See also\nentry on\n Russell\u2019s paradox.)\n\nAlthough it took several decades from Cantor\u2019s work to find a\nsystem of axioms for set theory that avoids these paradoxes (see the\nentries on\n the early development of set theory\n and\n set theory),\n Cantor already saw, in this unreachability of the totality of all\nordinals or cardinals, a notion of \u201cabsolute infinity\u201d.\nAlthough in his system, there are many infinite sets that are\ntractable and graspable at many different levels, starting with the\nnatural numbers (which Aristotle had thought was merely potential\nrather than actual), he discovered an even greater Aristotelian\npotential infinity. This led to the distinction between a\n\u201cset\u201d as a totality that can be grasped in the relevant\nsense, and a \u201cproper class\u201d, which is too large even for a\nsystem that encompasses each of Cantor\u2019s many infinities.\n\nWe can define addition for cardinal numbers as the cardinality of a\nset that is the union of two disjoint sets of those cardinalities. We\ncan define multiplication for a pair of cardinal numbers as the\ncardinality of the set of all ordered pairs whose first elements are\ndrawn from a set of the first cardinality and whose second elements\nare drawn from a set of the second cardinality. But it turns out that\nthese operations are relatively trivial once we get beyond the finite\ncardinals\u2014just as we saw that the sum or product of two\ncountable ordinals was still countable, the sum or product of two\ninfinite cardinals is equal to whichever of the two is larger! (At\nleast this operation is commutative.) Thus, one can\u2019t get to\n\\(\\aleph_1\\) from \\(\\aleph_0\\) by means of addition or multiplication\n(as we saw when we considered order types achieved by addition and\nmultiplication).\n\nHowever, cardinal exponentiation is more powerful. It turns out to be\nnatural to define \\(2^\\kappa\\) as the cardinality of the power set of\na set whose cardinality is \\(\\kappa\\). (Greek letters \\(\\kappa\\) and\n\\(\\lambda\\) are traditionally used as variables to represent infinite\ncardinals, with letters \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) used for ordinals.)\nIt turns out that the cardinality of the set of real numbers\n(otherwise called the \u201ccontinuum\u201d for its role in\nrepresenting continuous space) is the same as that of the power set of\nthe natural numbers, \\(2^{\\aleph_0}\\), and Cantor showed that\n\\(2^{\\aleph_0}>\\aleph_0\\). Cantor conjectured that \\(2^{\\aleph_0}\\)\nwas in fact equal to \\(\\aleph_1\\), and this conjecture was called the\n\u201cContinuum hypothesis\u201d. (See the entry on\n the continuum hypothesis\n for more on this conjecture and why it hasn\u2019t been\nsettled.)\n\nJust as \\(\\aleph_1\\) is a cardinality that can\u2019t be reached by\nthe operations of ordinal addition, multiplication, or exponentiation,\neven in the limit, one might conjecture that even before one reaches\nthe Cantorian absolute infinity, there are further cardinalities that\ncan still be grasped in some sense, but can\u2019t be reached even by\nthe stronger operation of cardinal exponentiation, even in the limit.\nSuch conjectures have turned out to be surprisingly fruitful for the\nstudy of set theory and mathematical logic generally. (See the entry\non\n large cardinals and determinacy.)\n\nAlthough we have defined addition and multiplication for both ordinals\nand cardinals, their features make it hard to make sense of\nsubtraction or division. First, the non-commutativity of the ordinal\noperations, and the triviality of the cardinal operations, makes it\nhard to define meaningful inverses of these operations. (If it\u2019s\npossible to find an ordinal or cardinal that can be added or\nmultiplied to a first one to get a second one, then it is usually\npossible to find infinitely many that can.) But more importantly, the\nconceptual ideas of counting (whether by order type or by bijection)\ndon\u2019t really allow for negatives or fractions, the way that the\nconceptual ideas of measuring and geometry do (considered in section\n 3.2).\n Counting involves treating each element as discrete and unique, and\nthere is no way for multiple elements to combine to yield nothing (as\nsubtraction requires) or to yield a unit (as division does). However,\nmeasurement (e.g., of distance) involves a sort of structure on the\nthing being measured so that some measurements can be fractions of\nothers, or can point in the opposite direction, which yields\nmeaningful notions of division and subtraction.\n\nThis section has given just an introductory taste of the mathematics\nof ordinal and cardinal numbers\u2014it has come to be called\nCantor\u2019s Paradise. But we have already seen many\ncharacteristic features of these notions of infinity that\ndifferentiate them starkly from those discussed in the previous\nsection. Just as the differences between the natural numbers and the\nreal numbers demonstrate the differences between counting elements of\nsets, and measuring lengths, areas, and so on, the differences between\nCantor\u2019s cardinals and the extended reals further demonstrate\ndifferences between counting and measuring.\n\nFor further discussion of the kind of material presented in this\nsection, see the SEP entries on:\n set theory,\n the early development of set theory, and\n the axiom of choice.\n An excellent introduction to basic set theory is Enderton (1977); an\ninformal but still rigorous introduction is Sheppard (2014); more\nadvanced texts include Devlin (1993), Kunen (1983), and Jech (2006).\nFor the higher reaches, to which we will come back in section\n 4,\n see Kanamori (2003).\n\nSet theory provides a theory of cardinality that implements the idea\nthat \u201csameness of size\u201d upholds the bijection intuition.\nThe recent theory of numerosities, developed by Benci, Di Nasso, and\nForti, by contrast, upholds the part-whole intuition.
