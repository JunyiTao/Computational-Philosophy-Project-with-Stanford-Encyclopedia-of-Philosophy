    "main_text": "Applied Questions in Immigration || Irregular Migrants\n3.4 Irregular Migrants\n\n\nFollowing Joseph Carens (2013), I call those who have settled in a\nforeign country without authorization (who some label\n\u201cundocumented\u201d or \u201cillegal\u201d immigrants) \nirregular migrants. Irregular migrants pose vexing moral\nquestions even for those who are convinced that states have the right\nto control immigration, because many believe that over time an\nirregular migrant can gradually acquire a moral right to stay (and\nperhaps even to full and equal citizenship), despite the fact that she\nhad no right to migrate without authorization in the first place. \nCarens articulates this sentiment nicely when he writes:\n\n\nThe moral right of states to apprehend and deport irregular migrants\nerodes with the passage of time. As irregular migrants become\nmore and more settled, their membership in society grows in moral\nimportance, and the fact that they have settled without authorization\nbecomes correspondingly less relevant. At some point a threshold\nis crossed, and they acquire a moral claim to have their actual social\nmembership legally recognized. They should acquire a legal right\nof permanent residence and all the rights that go with that, including\neventual access to citizenship. (Carens 2013: 150)\n\n\nGiven the psychological importance of social membership and the fact\nthat (authorized or not) a migrant will typically become deeply\nsocially imbedded in her new society after a prolonged period, the\nappeal of this judgment is easy to appreciate. Critics might counter,\nhowever, that this account wrongly presumes that psychological\nattachment is sufficient to generate moral entitlement. To see why one\nmight doubt this, imagine that I grow incredibly attached to the Mona\nLisa during the ten years that it takes for the authorities to\ndiscover that I am the one who stole it from the Louvre. No matter how\nattached I become to the painting (and regardless of how\npsychologically difficult it will be for me to find happiness in my\nnew life without it), most would presumably deny that I have therefore\nacquired a right to retain the stolen painting. And given that we are\nso resistant to suppose that the right of authorities to reclaim the\nMona Lisa and return it to the Louvre erodes with the passage of time,\nperhaps we should similarly be suspicious of the notion that the\n\u201cmoral right of states to apprehend and deport irregular migrants\nerodes with the passage of time\u201d (as in the quote from Carens\nabove). \n\n\nOne exception to this line of thought may be the children of irregular\nmigrants who were brought to the new country at a very young\nage. After all, because they had no choice in their migration, they\nhave no culpability which needs to erode over time. Critics have room\nto resist even this case, however, because the crucial issue is\nentitlement, not culpability. Suppose that I pass\nthe Mona Lisa on to my son, Jackson (who has no idea that I stole it),\nand that he becomes incredibly attached to it over the course of\nseveral years. Despite the twin facts that (1) Jackson is in no way\nculpable for possessing the Mona Lisa and (2) he has gradually become\nvery attached to it, he does not seem entitled to keep the\npainting. And if we think the authorities would violate none of\nJackson\u2019s rights if they took the Mona Lisa from him and returned it\nto the Louvre, then why think that the authorities would violate the\nrights of an irregular migrant who at a young age had settled without\nauthorization in a foreign country with her parents? Just as Jackson\nshould not be punished for his possession of the painting, the child\nshould clearly not be punished for having entered a foreign country\nwithout authorization. But Jackson\u2019s right against being punished is\ndistinct from his right to retain the Mona Lisa, and the child\u2019s right\nnot to be punished for her family\u2019s migration is distinct from her\nright to remain in the new country. These objections do not show that\nirregular migrants do not gradually acquire a right to stay, but they\ndo suggest that advocates of this position who also believe in the\nstate\u2019s right to control immigration must do more than merely point to\nthe psychological costs to those who might be deported.\n",
