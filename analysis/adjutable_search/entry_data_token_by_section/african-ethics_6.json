    "main_text": "The Notion of the Common Good\n7. The Notion of the Common Good\n\n\nThe notion of the common good features manifestly in African ethics.\nIn Akan moral thought, the notion is expressed most vividly in an art\nmotif that shows a \u2018siamese\u2019 crocodile with two heads but a\nsingle (i.e., common) stomach. The part of the motif\nrelevant to moral thought is the single stomach, and it is to the\nsignificance of this that I wish to pay some attention. The common\nstomach of the two crocodiles indicates that at least the basic\ninterests of all the members of the community are identical. It\ncan therefore be interpreted as symbolizing the common good,\nthe good of all the individuals within a society.\n\n\nThe common good is not a surrogate for the sum of the various\nindividual goods. It does not consist of, or derive from, the goods and\npreferences of particular individuals. It is that which is essentially\ngood for human beings as such, embracing the needs that are\nbasic to the enjoyment and fulfillment of the life of each\nindividual. If the common good were the aggregate of individual goods,\nit would only be contingently, not essentially, common and, on that\nscore, it would not be achieved in a way that will benefit all the\nindividuals in a society. If the common good is achieved, then the\nindividual good is also achieved. Thus, there should be no conceptual\ntension or opposition between the common good and the good of the\nindividual member of the community, for the common good embraces the\ngoods\u2014the basic goods\u2014of all the members of the community. If\nthe common good were understood as the basic good\u2014as human good\u2014as\nsuch, there would be no need to think of it as a threat to individual\nliberty as touted by Western liberal (individualist) thinkers, for,\nafter all, individual liberty is held as one of the basic goods of the\nmembers of the society. The contents of the common stomach, in the\nsymbolic art of the \u2018siamese crocodile\u2019, would not conflict\nwith the interests and needs of either of the crocodiles.\n\n\nThe good, as discussed in an earlier section, is defined by\nthe traditional thinkers of the Akan society in terms of peace,\nhappiness or satisfaction (human flourishing), justice, dignity,\nrespect, and so on. The common good embraces these goods and more.\n\n\nThere is no human being who does not desire peace, security,\nfreedom, dignity, respect, justice, equality, and satisfaction. It is\nsuch a moral, not a weird, notion embracive of fundamental\ngoods\u2014goods that are intrinsic to human fulfillment and to which\nall individuals desire to have access\u2014that is referred to as the\ncommon good. The unrelenting support by people in a community for such\nmoral values as social justice and equality on the one hand, and the\nspontaneous, universal denunciation of acts such as murder and cruelty\non the other hand, are certainly inspired by beliefs in the common\ngood.\n\n\nSimilarly, the institutions of various kinds\u2014legal, political,\neconomic, moral and others\u2014are set up in pursuit of certain\ncommonly shared values and goals, that is, a common good which a human\nsociety desires to achieve for all of its members. The\ninstitution of government or legal system is surely based on a common\nunderstanding of the need for societal values of social order and\nsocial peace. It is, thus, pretty clear that the common good is that\nwhich inspires the creation of a moral, social, political, or legal\nsystem for enhancing the well-being of people in a community.\n\n\nThe common good is a notion that is conceptually affiliated to the\nnotion of community and, thus, to the notion of human society as such.\nThe common good is an essential feature of the ethics espoused by the\ncommunitarian African society. The pursuit of the good of all is the\ngoal of the communitarian society, which the African society is. A\nsense of the common good\u2014which is a core of shared values\u2014is the\nunderlying presupposition of African social morality.\n",
