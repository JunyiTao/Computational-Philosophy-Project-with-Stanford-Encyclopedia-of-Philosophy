Law can be an\nanchor to the past or an engine for the future. Each function has its\nplace. Feminist legal philosophy is an effort to examine and\nreformulate legal doctrine to overcome entrenched bias and enforced\ninequality of the past as it structures human concepts and\ninstitutions for the future.\n",
