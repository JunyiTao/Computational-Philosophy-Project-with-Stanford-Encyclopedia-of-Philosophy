Schoenfield interprets judgments about rationality,\nin cases like Aisha\u2019s, as plans. She points out that we\ncan evaluate plans in (at least) two different ways: by looking at\nwhat will happen if they are followed perfectly, and by looking at\nwhat will happen if they are made. If you need to leave the house at\n10:30, but are habitually running late, \u201cleave the house at\n10\u201d might be the best plan to make, even if \u201cleave the\nhouse at 10:30\u201d is the best plan to follow. This is similar to\nDiPaolo\u2019s suggestion in that the difference between the best\nplan to make and the best plan to follow depends on a person\u2019s\n(predicted) rational shortcomings: the best plan to make is one that\ntakes these shortcomings into account in a particular way. However,\nSchoenfield\u2019s view is not that higher-order evidence\nonly has rational import for non-ideal agents; rather, it has the\nimport it has for anyone who rationally believes that they\nare non-ideal.\n\nAn advantage of this approach is that it allows us to focus on\naccuracy as the primary target of epistemic rationality. Schoenfield\nframes both modes of evaluation in terms of accuracy: specifically,\nthe accuracy-related consequences of the plan. So if she is\nright that the best-plan-to-make/best-plan-to-follow distinction can\nexplain higher-order evidence, we would end up with a relatively\nuniform two-norm view. See Horowitz 2019 for two objections: first,\nthat focusing on consequences seems to open the door to non-epistemic\nplans, such as \u201chave a sandwich before reasoning\u201d; second,\nthat the best plan to make might differ among different believers, in\nwhich case this strategy would not yield anything like a general\ndefense of revising in response to higher-order evidence. This second\nworry also raises questions about DiPaolo\u2019s proposal and how\nuniversal we can expect a non-ideal rationality to be.\n",
