A Different Kind of Challenge: Voluntarism\n\nInformed consent requires that a patient be able to make a\nmeaningful decision for herself. But this is just the pre-requisite.\nIf the individual has capacity then he or she must be given all\nrelevant information, and then he or she must make a free or\nvoluntary decision. Voluntariness is complicated terrain, and\nmost of the discussion of voluntariness in informed consent has\nfocused on the sorts of illegitimate behaviors by other people that\ncan undermine voluntariness: force, coercion (threats) and undue\ninducement (Hawkins & Emanuel 2005).\n\nHowever, a more neglected question (at least in the literature on\ninformed consent) is the question of whether factors internal\nto the person can undermine voluntariness. If so, what are these\nfactors and how do we identify them? If such factors exist, then they\nmay most usefully be discussed in connection with decisional capacity\nas opposed to external topics like coercion. This is because questions\nabout internal psychological barriers bring us back once more to\nquestions about the particular abilities of the individual patient or\nsubject, and because if there are problems here, their presence and\nextent are most likely to be assessed by clinicians. Arguably, just as\nfailure to grasp the facts of the situation can make a choice\nmeaningless, something like addiction\u2014which in certain contexts\nalmost guarantees that the person will choose in a particular\nway\u2014may also thereby make choice meaningless (Charland 2002,\n2011).\n\nIn the early days of psychiatry, it was widely recognized that there\ncould be lesions of the will, just as there could be lesions of the\nunderstanding and affective capacities. Towards the end of the\nnineteenth century the French philosopher-psychologist Theodule Ribot\npublished a highly influential book on the topic, entitled Les\nmaladies de la volent\u00e9\u2014later translated as\nDiseases of the Will (Ribot 1883). Ribot argued that the\ncapacity for voluntary choice could sometimes be compromised,\nperverted, or even virtually obliterated, by disease, and that the\nvarious impairments that resulted deserved to be scientifically\nstudied and classified. While it is no longer popular to speak of\n\u201cdiseases of the will\u201d contemporary clinicians and\nresearchers do recognize that human will and agency can be impaired or\neven depleted (Baumeister et al. 1998) in various ways by diseases of\nmany sorts. But there is still little understanding of what such\ndeficits mean for the doctrine of informed consent.\n\nThose contemporary theorists who think we need to acknowledge the\npossibility of genuine psychological barriers to voluntariness tend to\nask questions about the decision-making ability of patients with\naddiction (Charland 2002, 2011) or obsessive-compulsive disorder\n(Ruissen 2015; Ruissen et al. 2016).\n\nUnfortunately, the literature has paid little attention to the\ndistinction made above between internal psychological barriers and\nexternal barriers. For example, Appelbaum, Lidz, and Klitzman (2009)\nset out to chart the domain of voluntariness, but ended up focusing\nexclusively on external factors such as coercion and undue inducement.\nThey are explicit that since the law has traditionally treated\nvoluntariness in an external fashion\u2014as the absence of force,\ncoercion or undue inducement\u2014they have sought to explain only\nthese kinds of phenomena. However, this begs the ethical question of\nwhether there really might be internal barriers to meaningful choice\nand if so, whether the law ought to recognize them even if it\ncurrently doesn\u2019t. Other theorists such as Laura Weiss Roberts\n(2002a,b) have explored a wider range of factors that might affect voluntariness, but with the\nresult that far too much is included (as opposed to too much\nbeing excluded, as above). Approaches like hers fail to make crucial\ndistinctions between strong, though understandable, feelings a person\nmight have in response to a situation (but which need not undermine\nthe voluntariness of a choice) and more plausible threats to\nvoluntariness such as addiction. The difficulty is precisely to\ndistinguish genuine impediments to voluntary choice from the many and\nvaried internal factors that can influence choice, and/or lead to\nimprudent or unwise choices. Much work remains to be done here. \n",
