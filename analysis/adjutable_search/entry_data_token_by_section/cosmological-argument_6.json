I answer that the\nuniting of these parts into a whole\u2026is performed merely by an\narbitrary act of the mind, and has no influence on the nature of\nthings. Did I show you the particular causes of each individual in a\ncollection of twenty particles of matter, I should think it very\nunreasonable should you afterwards ask me what was the cause of the\nwhole twenty. This is sufficiently explained in explaining the parts.\n(Hume 1779: part 9)\n\n\nHume contends that uniting the parts or individual constituents into a\nwhole is a mental act. In reality, all that exist are individual,\ncausally-related events, not whole sets of events. When we have\nprovided an account of each of these individual, causally-related\nevents we have explained the whole. We don\u2019t need anything\nmore.\n\nRowe objects to what he terms the Hume-Edwards principle\u2014that by\nexplaining the parts we have explained the whole:\n\n\nWhen the existence of each member of a collection is explained by\nreference to some other member of that very same collection,\nthen it does not follow that the collection itself has an explanation.\nFor it is one thing for there to be an explanation of the existence of\neach dependent being and quite another thing for there to be an\nexplanation of why there are dependent beings at all. (Rowe 1975:\n264)\n\n\nPruss (1999) expands on Rowe\u2019s argument. An explanation of the\nparts may provide a partial but not a complete explanation. The\nexplanation in terms of parts may fail to explain why these parts\nexist rather than others, why they exist rather than not, or why the\nparts are arranged as they are. Each member or part will be explained\neither in terms of itself or in terms of something else that is\ncontingent. The former would make them necessary, not contingent,\nbeings. If they are explained in terms of something else, they still\nremain unaccounted for, since the explanation would invoke either an\ninfinite regress of causes or a circular explanation. Pruss employs\nthe chicken/egg sequence: chickens account for eggs, which account for\nchickens, and so on where the two are paired. However, appealing to an\ninfinite chicken/egg regress or else arguing in a circle explains\nneither any given chicken nor egg.\n\nRichard Swinburne notes that an explanation is complete when\n\u201cany attempt to go beyond the factors which we have would result\nin no gain of explanatory power or prior probability\u201d (2004:\n89). However, explaining why something exists rather than something\nelse or than nothing and why it is as it is gives additional\nexplanatory power in explaining why a universe exists at all. Gale\n(1991: 257\u201358) concludes that if we are to explain the parts of\nthe universe and their specific concatenation, we must appeal to\nsomething other than those parts.\n",
