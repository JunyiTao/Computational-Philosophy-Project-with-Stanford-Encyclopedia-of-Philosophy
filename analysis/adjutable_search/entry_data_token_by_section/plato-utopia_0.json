    "main_text": "Authenticity and Chronology\n1. Authenticity and Chronology\n\nIn the more exuberantly speculative days of the 19th century, the\nauthenticity of the Laws was rejected by various figures:\neven the great Platonist, Ast, held that \u201cOne who knows the true\nPlato needs only to read a single page of the Laws in order\nto convince himself that it is a fraudulent Plato that he has before\n him.\u201d[1]\n Such skepticism is hard to understand, especially since Aristotle\nrefers to the Laws as a dialogue of Plato\u2019s in numerous\npassages and today no serious scholar doubts its authenticity.\n\nOn the question of chronology, two external references are\nhelpful:\n\nAristotle tells us that the Laws is later than the\nRepublic, (Pol. 2.6) and\nDiogenes Laertius (3.37) reports that it was unfinished at\nPlato\u2019s death (and the text of the Laws itself shows\nsome signs of incompleteness and lack of\n revision).[2]\n\n\nPlatonic scholars also frequently appeal to stylometry (that is, the\nquantitative study of the features of Plato\u2019s prose style) to\nhelp to date the dialogues. Although the usefulness of stylometry is\nsometimes questioned, it is widely accepted and the agreement of many\nsuch studies allows us to divide the dialogues, with some confidence,\ninto three\n groups.[3]\n\nGroup 3: Critias, Laws, Philebus,\nSophist, Statesman, and Timaeus\n\nGroup 2: Parmenides, Phaedrus, Republic,\nand Theaetetus\n\nGroup 1: the rest\n\n\nDrawing upon other evidence, it is reasonable to see the dialogues in\nGroup 3 as the latest. Given the length of the Laws (it is\nthe longest of the dialogues and is, roughly 20% longer than the\nRepublic), it seems likely that its composition overlapped\nwith the composition of at least some of the other dialogues in Group\n3.\n",
