In contrast, a posteriori knowledge depends on\nexperiences such as empirical observations and introspection of\none\u2019s conscious states. If a proposition can be known a\npriori, then we can somehow see that it is true just by thinking\nand reasoning about it (see entry on\n a priori justification and knowledge).\n Here are some paradigm examples of propositions one can know a\npriori:\n\n(1)\n that all bachelors are unmarried\n(2)\n that all three sided plane figures will also have three angles\n(3)\nthat 2 + 3 = 5.\n\n\nHere are some paradigm examples of moral propositions:\n\n(4)\nthat all murder is wrong\n(5)\nthat no person\u2019s good is any more important than the good of\nany other person\n(6)\nthat I ought to do some volunteer work with Habitat for Humanity\nthis weekend.\n\n\nMany philosophers think we can know some moral propositions a\npriori. Few deny that we can know (4) a priori or the\nproposition that if it would be wrong not to do something, one\nought to do it or other propositions that are obviously true\nbecause of definitions. But some philosophers claim we can know more\nsignificant moral propositions a priori.\n\nOn one familiar view, we can know a priori the fundamental\nmoral principle (or principles), e.g., the principle that one ought to\nperform the action that has the overall best consequences, or the\nprinciple that one ought to act in accordance with virtue, or whatever\nthe basic moral principle really is. Some hold we can know the\nprinciple via analysis or because it defines the moral term it is\nabout. We can then know every day moral propositions about particular\nactions or types of actions by inferring them from the fundamental\nprinciple in conjunction with empirical facts.\n\nHowever, some theorists claim we can know many more moral propositions\na priori, in particular, propositions that are not so closely\ntied to the meaning or reference of moral terms. Others go farther,\nclaiming that most or all moral claims can be known a priori,\nor even that moral claims can be known only a\npriori.\n\nIn this entry, we clarify the concept of a priori knowledge\n(and related concepts), as well as the relationship between a\npriori knowledge and analyticity. We then review Kant\u2019s\nview of moral knowledge, early 20th century versions of\nnon-naturalism, late 20th century versions of naturalism,\nparticularism, and finally some 21st century versions of\nintuitionism\u2014all with an eye to the role they afford to a\npriori knowledge.\n", "toc": [{"#Prel": "1.

Preliminaries\n1.1 A Priori Knowledge and Justification: The Standard View\n\nThe concept of the a priori is fundamentally a concept of\nindependence from experience. The a priori stands in\ncontrast to the a posteriori or empirical. Knowledge is\nempirical just in case it is derived from experience. What experience\nincludes is contested. Experience uncontroversially includes sense\nperception. It arguably also includes introspection and the testimony\nof others. Much of what we know is empirical: we know by sense\nperception or introspection or the testimony of others, etc. A\npriori knowledge\u2014if there is any\u2014would be independent\nof sense perception, introspection, etc. (see entry on\n rationalism vs. empiricism).\n A majority of epistemologists could probably agree that justification\nis necessary for knowledge if one interprets justification broadly\n(e.g., so that a belief might be justified in virtue of being produced\nby a reliable cognitive mechanism, or by an exercise of intellectual\nvirtue, or by having supporting evidence from good reasons). For the\npurposes of this entry, we will understand justification broadly and\nassume that in order to have a priori knowledge of a\nproposition one\u2019s belief in that proposition must be justified\n(see entries on\n the analysis of knowledge;\n foundationalist theories of epistemic justification;\n coherentist theories of epistemic justification;\n internalist vs. externalist conceptions of epistemic justification).\n\nSo on what we will call the standard view of a priori\nknowledge and\n justification,[1]\n being justified makes a very significant contribution to the\nepistemic status required for knowledge. Hence, for one\u2019s\nknowledge to be independent of experience, one\u2019s justification\nwould also have to be independent of experience. Such justification is\na priori.\n\nHowever, it is unlikely S could be justified in believing any\nproposition P in a way that is completely independent of\nexperience. For one thing, S must grasp or understand P\nbefore S could be justified in believing it. According to one\nfamiliar view, propositions involve properties and in order to\nunderstand a proposition, S must have or grasp concepts\ncorresponding to these properties. The majority of our concepts are\nempirical. Hence, without experience S could not believe, or\neven understand, most propositions; so without experience S\ncould not be justified in believing these propositions. For example,\nit is unlikely the concepts of marriage and bachelorhood are innate,\nso not even\n (1)\n is a proposition S could be justified in believing without any\nexperience at all. Hence, the sense in which a priori\njustification is independent of experience must be further specified:\nat the very least, experiences required to understand a proposition,\nincluding experiences necessary to grasp the relevant concepts, do not\ncount against being justified independently of experience.\n\nAccording to the standard view of a priori justification,\nonce S has the experiences needed to acquire the concepts of\nmarriage and bachelorhood and S understands\n (1),\n S has justification to believe\n (1).\n No additional experience is needed. Compare:\n\n(7)\n that all bachelors are untidy.\n\n\nIf S has the experiences needed to acquire the concepts of\nbachelorhood and untidiness, acquires these concepts, and understands\n(7), S will not have a justification to believe (7)\u2014even\nif we suppose, for the moment, that all bachelors are untidy. S\nwould have to observe many bachelors and their personal habits, or be\ntold about the personal habits of bachelors by others for (7) to be\njustified. As we\u2019ve already noted,\n (1)\n is different: once S understands\n (1),\n this proposition will be justified for S\u2014or so says the\nstandard view.\n\nSo far we have only a negative account of a priori\njustification; it is justification that does not depend on experiences\nbeyond those necessary for understanding. But in virtue of what could\nS be justified in believing something apart from experience?\nThe standard answer appeals to the special nature of the propositions\nthat can be a priori justified: they are supposed to be\nself-evident.\n\n(SE)\nA proposition P is self-evident just in case P is\nevident for any person S who understands P. (P is\nevident for S when S has a degree of justification\nfor P that, when combined with some other conditions, is\nsufficient for S to have knowledge of P.)\n\n\nThis definition of self-evidence may not be entirely satisfactory. One\nseeking a positive, informative account of how S could be\njustified in believing P simply in virtue of the fact that\nS understands P should not be satisfied when told that\nP is a special, self-evident proposition, when all this means\nis that P is justified to a high degree for everyone who\nunderstands it. Nevertheless, the lack of an explanation of the\nmechanism that brings something about is not a decisive reason for\nthinking it could not come about. We shall assume that (SE) correctly\ndefines self-evidence.\n\nEven though any person, S, who understands a self-evident\nproposition, PSE, will be justified in believing\nPSE to a degree sufficient for knowledge, we cannot\nsay that if S understands PSE and believes\nPSE, then S will know PSE.\nWe have not yet addressed the connection between self-evidence and\ntruth, but this is not the problem: self-evidence is taken to imply\ntruth. To explain why S could understand and believe\nPSE but fail to know PSE, it will\nbe helpful to distinguish between propositional justification and\ndoxastic justification.\n\nWe introduce the distinction in terms of having good reasons, but it\ncan be generalized to other ways of being justified. If S has\ngood reasons for believing a proposition, P, e.g., if S\nknows some propositions that straightforwardly entail P,\nS has a propositional justification for P. Note that\nP might be propositionally justified for S even though\nS does not believe P\u2014while S knows\npropositions that entail P, the proposition P might\nnever have even occurred to S. E.g., suppose S knows\nthat her only pets are two cats. This entails that she has no pet\nhippopotamus, so this proposition is propositionally justified for\nS. But unless S is a little odd, this is not a\nproposition S currently believes. The formulation\n\u201cP is propositionally justified for S\u201d\nleaves open whether S believes P. The formulation\n\u201cS is propositionally justified in believing\nP\u201d indicates that P is propositionally justified\nfor S and that S believes P.\n\nIf S believes P and does so on the basis of good\nreasons, then S\u2019s believing P is doxastically\njustified. Significantly, doxastic justification requires more than\npropositional justification plus belief. P could be\npropositionally justified for S and S could believe\nP, but not believe P on the basis of the good reasons\nthat constitute S\u2019s propositional justification for\nP. E.g., despite having excellent reasons to believe there are\nno vampires, Vlad believes he is safe from vampires only because he\neats lots of garlic and wears a special cross to repel vampires.\nVlad\u2019s belief that he is safe from vampires would be\npropositionally justified, but not doxastically justified. Unless\nnoted, when we use \u201cjustified\u201d and its cognates without\nqualification we will mean \u201cdoxastically justified\u201d.\nKnowledge requires basing the belief in the proposition on something\nthat justifies it. This goes for moral knowledge of self-evident moral\npropositions as well as it goes for any other kind of knowledge.\n\nSo far, the standard view may understand the class of a\npriori propositions too narrowly. Mathematics and logic are\nregarded as the paradigm a priori disciplines. But it is\ndoubtful that all the mathematical and logical truths we know are\nself-evident. Many of these truths require proof. When S\nbelieves such a proposition, S\u2019s belief will not be based\nsolely on understanding the proposition. S\u2019s experience\nof constructing the proof will play an important role in\nS\u2019s justification for believing the proposition proven.\nIf the proof is complex, S\u2019s justification will probably\nin part rely on memory, e.g., of lemmas proven along the way. The\nstandard view can extend the class of a priori propositions\nwithout compromising its basic approach by adding that if S\nbelieves P on the basis of proving it from self-evident\npremises by steps that are self-evidently valid, then S is\na priori justified in believing P.\n\nTo sum up, the standard view holds that a priori knowledge is\njustified independently of experience, where this means experience\nbeyond the experience required to understand the relevant proposition.\nThere are certain special, self-evident propositions that are\npropositionally justified for any person who understands them. If a\nperson believes a self-evident proposition solely on the basis of\nunderstanding it, the person will be doxastically justified in\nbelieving it. Such propositions are often referred to as a\npriori, which should be taken to mean that it is possible for one\nto be a priori justified in believing them. By extension,\npropositions are also a priori if they can be deduced from\nself-evident premises via steps that are self-evidently valid. A\nperson who believes such a proposition on the basis of such a proof\nwill be a priori justified in believing it. It is also\npossible to be empirically justified in believing an a priori\nproposition, but one cannot be a priori justified in\nbelieving empirical\n propositions.[2]\n\nBefore closing the presentation of the standard view, we should\nhighlight a potential problem already implicit in our presentation. As\nwe stressed, the basic concept of a priori justification is\nof justification that is independent of experience. The standard view\nrecognizes that one typically needs experience to understand a\nproposition, and interprets experience independent justification as\njustification that requires no additional experience. But consider an\nexperience like this. You believe a mathematical proposition is true,\nbut solely on a teacher\u2019s testimony. You do not know for\nyourself. But then after turning the proposition over in your mind for\na while, perhaps by thinking through some examples, you \u201cget\nit\u201d; you \u201csee\u201d that the proposition is indeed true\n(see Bealer 2000).\n\nWhat happens in such cases? Understanding alone does not seem to\njustify you in believing. To be justified in believing the\nproposition\u2014in a way that does not depend upon\ntestimony\u2014you need to \u201csee\u201d it for yourself. Such\n\u201cseeing\u201d has various names, e.g., \u201cintuition\u201d,\n\u201crational insight\u201d, \u201cclear and distinct\nperception\u201d. But whatever it is called, it is hard to deny it is\nan experience. So the standard view faces a problem: there is a\ndistinctive kind of experience apparently required for a\npriori justification in believing, and hence, a priori\nknowledge of, some propositions typically regarded as a\npriori and perhaps even self-evident. One might be led to\nquestion whether one who understands such a proposition but has not\nyet had the experience of \u201cseeing\u201d the proposition to be\ntrue even has propositional justification. Finally, one might be led\nto wonder whether this kind of \u201cexperience\u201d is always\nrequired for a priori knowledge and justification that does\nnot depend upon proof.\n\nThose who take the standard view might respond by accepting that\nrational intuition is an experience and distinguishing this experience\nfrom the experiences that are involved in empirical justification,\ni.e., perception, proprioception, introspection, and memory. This\nmodified standard view could then maintain that a priori\nknowledge and justification are independent of the latter experiences,\nbut not necessarily all experience; a priori justification\ncan be grounded in an experience of rational intuition\u2014perhaps\nit is always so grounded. Thus, on the modified standard view, the\nspecial role of understanding comes down to this: understanding an\na priori proposition is the only prerequisite for\nrational insight into its truth; understanding the proposition does\nnot guarantee that one will attain such insight, but it is the only\nthing that is necessary. Notice, on this modified standard view,\nself-evident propositions no longer play such a prominent role. It is\nnot an essential part of the view that there are special propositions,\nand anyone who understands one of these propositions has propositional\njustification. If one wants to think in terms of special propositions,\nthere will be propositions that are special only in an attenuated\nsense: it is possible for a person to have the experience of seeing\nthe propositions to be true simply by understanding and thinking about\nthem. Some might consider this modification too much of a departure\nfrom the spirit of the standard view.\n\nWhile it is not beyond criticism, we will proceed assuming the\nstandard view about a priori knowledge and justification is\ntrue.\n1.2 Analyticity and the A Priori\n\nAccording to Kant\u2019s original formulation, in analytic judgments\nthe concept of the predicate is contained in the concept of the\nsubject (1781 [1998]: A6\u20137).\n (1),\n that all bachelors are unmarried, provides a good illustration. On\none view, being a bachelor is a complex concept that is composed of\nbeing unmarried as well as being an adult male. So the concept of a\nbachelor \u201ccontains\u201d the concept of being unmarried. Hence,\npart of thinking of someone as a bachelor is thinking of him as\nunmarried. Compare this with the synthetic proposition\n (7),\n that all bachelors are untidy. The concept of being a bachelor is not\npartly composed of the concept of being untidy. Thinking of someone as\nuntidy is not part of thinking of him as a bachelor. So being a\nbachelor does not \u201ccontain\u201d being untidy. A more\ncontemporary understanding holds that sentences are analytic just in\ncase they can be converted into logical truths by replacing terms with\nterms that have equivalent meanings (Frege 1884 [1980]). The more\ncontemporary understanding counts more propositions as analytic than\nKant\u2019s original formulation: for example, all logical truths\nwill be counted as analytic, as well as a sentence such as \u201cif\nthere is blizzard, then there will be snow.\u201d\n\nOne might be tempted to think that all and only propositions expressed\nby analytic sentences can have a priori justification, and\nthat propositions expressed by synthetic sentences can only have a\nposteriori justification. We should resist this temptation. A\nnumber of philosophers, beginning with Kant, have claimed that some\nsynthetic propositions can have a priori justification. As we\nwill discuss below, Kant thought that all moral propositions were\nsynthetic but could be established only by reason. Moreover, if one\nconsiders what is fundamental to the two distinctions, there is no\nobvious reason to assume they would perfectly coincide. The\nanalytic/synthetic distinction fundamentally concerns conceptual or\nmeaning relations, specifically, whether the subject of a proposition\ncontains the predicate or whether the proposition is equivalent to a\nlogical truth. The a priori/a posteriori distinction\nis fundamentally epistemic, being concerned with whether experience is\nrequired for justification. Two such fundamentally different\ndistinctions could coincide, but it is not immediately apparent that\nthey do; it would take considerable work to show that they do.\n\nFinally, we must at least mention Quine\u2019s (1951) important\nattack on the coherence of the analytic/synthetic distinction. He\nargued that there\u2019s no clear way of distinguishing between\nanalytic sentences and sentences that merely express very strongly\naccepted propositions. Many philosophers have found Quine\u2019s\nargument persuasive, but the concept of analyticity has not been\nabandoned by all philosophers, indeed a majority still accept it (see\nentry on\n the analytic/synthetic distinction).\n We will make use of the of the analytic/synthetic distinction in this\nentry.\n1.3 Cognitivism and Non-Cognitivism\n\nWe can divide metaethical positions into two kinds: cognitivist and\nnon-cognitivist. Cognitivists hold that moral\nstatements\u2014statements such as \u201cLying is wrong\u201d and\n\u201cCourage is a virtue\u201d\u2014have truth-values, being\neither true or false. Cognitivists maintain that when one sincerely\nmakes a moral statement in an ordinary context, one believes the\nproposition expressed by the statement. Non-cognitivists hold that\nmoral statements are not truth-evaluable: moral statements are neither\ntrue nor false, being more akin to utterances such as (a)\n\u201cHaggis, YUCK!\u201d or (b) \u201cTake the haggis away!\u201d\nJust as, when one sincerely utters (a) or (b), one does not express a\nbelief, but does something else, non-cognitivists maintain that one\ndoes something other than express a belief when one makes a moral\nstatement. The early non-cognitivists A.J. Ayer (1936) and R.M. Hare\n(1952) maintained that moral statements were akin to utterances (a)\nand (b) respectively, that is, they express either emotive reactions\nor commands. Other forms of non-cognitivism propose different accounts\nof exactly what one does when one makes a moral statement (see entry\non\n moral cognitivism vs. non-cognitivism).\n Since non-cognitivism holds that we do not express beliefs when we\nmake moral statements, there is no reason for non-cognitivists to\nthink that there are any moral beliefs\u2014according to\nnon-cognitivism, even though moral statements typically have the form\nof declarative sentences, there are no moral propositions that\ncorrespond to them. If there are no moral beliefs or propositions,\nthere is no a priori moral justification or a priori\nmoral knowledge. So, the question of whether some moral propositions\ncan be justified a priori really comes up only in the context\nof cognitivism.\n\nHowever, many non-cognitivists want to vindicate as much of actual\nmoral thought and practice as possible, particularly quasi-realists\nsuch as Simon Blackburn (1993) and Alan Gibbard (2003). While denying\nthat there are, strictly speaking, moral propositions that are true or\nfalse (or moral beliefs, or moral arguments that are valid or\ninvalid), they would at the same time maintain that in the moral realm\nthere are things close enough to propositions, truth, belief, and\nvalidity that our practice of speaking of such things as moral beliefs\nand these beliefs being true or false makes sense. And such theorists\nwould certainly want to allow that moral beliefs can be better or\nworse in a way that closely corresponds to beliefs being more or less\nepistemically justified, strictly understood. So there are interesting\nquestions about whether there is something closely akin to a\npriori moral justification (and knowledge) on these views. But in\nthis entry we will limit ourselves to cognitivist theories.\n\nMoreover, serious questions regarding a priori moral\nknowledge and justification arise only for non-error-theoretic\nversions of cognitivism. Error theories, such as J.L. Mackie\u2019s,\nhold that moral statements express propositions, and hence are true or\nfalse, but that these propositions are all false. Moral propositions\nare systematically false because they presuppose something radically\nmistaken. Mackie claims they presuppose the existence of objectively\nprescriptive moral facts, when there are no such facts (1977: Ch. 1;\nbut see Berker 2019, which contests the standard interpretation of\nMackie presented here). A person could be justified in believing a\nfalse proposition, but one could not know it. And it is difficult to\nsee how one could even be justified a priori in believing a\nproposition of a type that is systematically false because it makes a\nradically mistaken presupposition. Thus, this entry focuses on\nnon-error-theoretic versions of cognitivism.\n\nHaving discussed some metaethical theories such as cognitivism and\nnon-cognitivism, we should pause to distinguish claims regarding a\npriori knowledge or justification of moral evaluations from\nclaims regarding a priori knowledge or justification of\nmeta-ethical propositions, such as that moral statements do not\nexpress propositions. Much meta-ethical theorizing is presented as an\nanalysis of moral language, and it seems likely that those involved\nthink of themselves as conducting an a priori inquiry. It\nwould be interesting to devote more specific attention to a\npriori meta-ethical epistemology, but we are concerned\nmostly with a priori knowledge or justification of moral\npropositions.\n\nWe focus almost exclusively on moral theories from the 20th\ncentury and later; the exception is Kant, with whom we begin. After\nbriefly discussing Kant, we move on to the non-naturalist moral\ntheories presented in the early part of the 20th century by\nMoore and Ross. We then consider naturalist moral theories developed\nmuch later in the 20th century, and close by considering\nparticularism and more recent versions of intuitionism that are\ndescendants of the positions developed by Moore and Ross.\n2. Kant\u2019s Synthetic A Priori Moral Truths\n\nFor Kant, there is a close connection between the nature of moral\ntruths\u2014in particular, their prescriptive content (i.e., what\nthey direct one to do), as well as their necessity and\nuniversality\u2014and the way in which we discover those truths,\nnamely, a priori. In his view, one can discover a maximally\ngeneral, fundamental moral principle. This is a principle that he\ncalls \u201cthe categorical imperative\u201d. Kant holds it can be\nknown through reason alone, specifically, via a transcendental\nargument (see entries on\n Kant\u2019s moral philosophy\n and\n transcendental arguments).\n He held that we could then deduce more specific, but still general\nmoral truths from this fundamental principle. Kant provides various\nformulations of the categorical imperative, the first being that one\nought to act only in accordance with a\n maxim[3]\n that one can at the same time will to become a universal\nlaw\u2014roughly, an act ought to be done by someone only if the\nperson could will, without contradiction, that everyone act as he or\nshe is acting. Examples of more specific principles he deduces from\nthe categorical imperative are that one ought not make lying promises\nor commit suicide. Kant\u2019s discussion of lying promises nicely\nillustrates how the categorical imperative works: A person in some\ndifficulty is considering making a promise he knows he cannot keep to\nescape the difficulty. To apply the categorical imperative, the person\nmust consider what would happen if everyone in some difficulty made a\nlying promise to escape. If so many lying promises were made, no one\nwould believe a person who promised to do something, so under these\nconditions one could not escape a difficulty by making a promise.\nHence, the person could not consistently will that his maxim be a\nuniversal law, since making it a universal law would frustrate his aim\nin making the lying promise. Therefore, one ought not escape a\ndifficulty by making a lying promise.\n\nIn Book II of the Groundwork (1785 [1996]) Kant claims the fundamental\nmoral truths are synthetic a priori because moral truths are\nprescriptive. Kant held that the categorical imperative is not\nanalytic, because although Kant thought the applicability of the\ncategorical imperative to any given individual is deducible from the\nassumption that the individual is rational, the concept of the\ncategorical imperative is not contained in the concept of a rational\nbeing. Kant thought the categorical imperative must be discovered\na priori\u2014through reason\u2014because, as a fundamental\nmoral law applying to all rational beings, it cannot be discovered\nthrough mere experience: one cannot learn how one should act\nfrom how people do act.\n\nMoreover, we can see why Kant may have thought that the necessity and\nuniversality of moral truths makes them impossible to discover a\nposteriori. Regarding necessity: observing how things actually go\nseems insufficient to find out how they must go. And regarding\nuniversality: if moral truths are universal in the sense that they are\ntrue in all contexts, then one could only verify the truth of a moral\nclaim by (a) experiencing all contexts and (b) perceiving the moral\ntruth in each one. But that is clearly impossible.\n\nThus, on a standard reading of Book II, the prescriptive content of\nmoral claims, along with their necessity and universality, led Kant to\nbelieve we know moral truths only a priori. However,\nsome interpret Kant as saying that if a moral truth is a\npriori, then it must also be necessary and universal (Dancy 2007:\n45). On this interpretation, if one knows P a priori,\nthen P must be necessary; after all, it\u2019s unclear how one\ncould know a contingent truth without experience. Moreover, if\nP is necessary, then P must also be universal; for if\nP must be true, then it is true in every actual case. So, on\nthis interpretation, Kant\u2019s views about moral epistemology\nmotivate his views about the content of moral claims, not vice\nversa. Regardless of which interpretation is correct, it\u2019s\nclear Kant thought there is a close relationship between the content\nof moral claims and how we come to know them.\n\nAs we will see, moral particularists deny there is any such\nrelationship between the content of moral claims and the means by\nwhich we know them. Particularists claim that we can have a\npriori moral knowledge, even though all moral truths are\ncontingent and particular.\n\nHow, specifically, does Kant think that one can establish the\ncategorical imperative a priori? The crucial premise is that\npractically rational beings are autonomous, in the sense that their\nwills can be determined by rules they give themselves. Kant holds that\nthe law that an autonomous agent gives to herself must tell her\nwhich ends to pursue and not merely which means to\nemploy in light of the ends the agent already has. Kant therefore\nrejects the more orthodox conception of practical reason as purely\ninstrumental, i.e., limited to discovering the means to ends dictated\nby something else, e.g., desire. The question then becomes,\n\u201cWhat rule or law could determine the rational will apart from\nany end?\u201d that is, \u201cWhat rule could possibly tell a\nrational agent which ends to pursue?\u201d Such a rule would have to\nbe formal, since it could not simply tell the agent what to do in\nlight of the ends she already has, and thus could not include any\nspecification of an end. This leads Kant to the categorical\nimperative, roughly: for an agent to perform a moral action, the maxim\nthe agent acts on must be one that the agent can consistently will to\ngovern everyone, regardless of their goals, as a necessary law.\n3. A Priori Justification and Early 20th Century Non-Naturalism\n3.1 The Naturalistic Fallacy and Intuitionism\n\nG.E. Moore reacted against views that provided naturalistic\ndefinitions of moral concepts, especially that of goodness\n(see entries on\n naturalism,\n and\n moral naturalism).\n One might question whether his targets actually held the view he\ncriticized, but let\u2019s set such worries aside and assume that as\nthe 19th-century drew to a close, philosophical ethics was\ndominated by hedonists who defined \u201cgood\u201d in terms of\npleasure, evolutionary ethicists who defined \u201cgood\u201d as the\nmost evolved, utilitarians who defined \u201cright\u201d as what\nproduces the most utility, and other naturalists. According to such\nviews, fundamental moral principles are analytic, and hence knowable\na priori. Since the fundamental principles defined moral\nconcepts in natural terms, one can infer whether some specific thing\nis good or action right from the principle conjoined with appropriate\npropositions about the natural properties of the thing or action, the\nlatter being knowable empirically. For example, one could infer that\nlistening to music is good from the analysis of \u201cgood\u201d as\nconducive to pleasure and the fact that listening to music is often\npleasant. In presenting Moore\u2019s response to such naturalistic\ndefinitions, we will focus on the position he took in Principia\nEthica (1903 [2003]) (although his views changed significantly\nover time).\n\nAccording Moore, all naturalistic analytic definitions of\n\u201cgood\u201d fail, committing what he called \u201cthe\nnaturalistic fallacy\u201d. To show all naturalistic analyses of\ngoodness fail, Moore presented the \u201copen-question\nargument\u201d. The basic idea is that if a definition of\n\u201cgood\u201d is correct, a morally competent person could not\nsensibly question whether something satisfying the definition is good.\nConsider a definable term: a triangle is a closed plane figure with\nthree angles. No person who understands the term can sensibly ask,\n\u201cX is a triangle, but is X three-angled?\u201d\nThe question is closed; an open question is one it\nmakes sense to ask. Moore claimed that for any naturalistic definition\nN of \u201cgood\u201d, the question \u201cX is\nN, but is it good?\u201d is open. For example, suppose someone\nanalyzes \u201cgood\u201d as conducive to pleasure. If the analysis\nwere correct, the question \u201cX is conducive to pleasure,\nbut is it good?\u201d should be closed. But the question is open; it\nis perfectly reasonable. One might, e.g., think of\nschadenfreude\u2014pleasure at another\u2019s\nmisfortune\u2014and wonder whether such pleasure is good. Hence,\nMoore would conclude, the analysis fails. Moore held that the argument\ncan be repeated for any proposed naturalistic analysis of\n\u201cgood\u201d, so \u201cgood\u201d cannot be analyzed in\nnatural terms. He concluded that goodness is non-natural (see entry on\n moral non-naturalism).\n Moore went further, holding that \u201cgood\u201d was unanalyzable,\nand that the property of goodness was simple and irreducible. These\nclaims about goodness do not follow from the failure of all\nnaturalistic analyses of \u201cgood\u201d, since it might\nbe possible to give a non-natural definition of\n\u201cgood\u201d, e.g., as what God approves. However, although he\ndoes not seem to have recognized it, at least in Principia\nEthica, the open question argument seems to work against nearly\nany definition of \u201cgood\u201d just as it works against natural\n definitions.[4]\n (For more on the open question argument and objections to it, see the\nentry on\n Moore\u2019s Moral Philosophy.)\n\nBecause of his views regarding moral concepts and properties, Moore\nconcluded that the fundamental moral principles are self-evident and\nthat moral knowledge can come only from moral \u201cintuition\u201d.\nSuperficially, his view seems to comport well with the standard\nconception of a priori knowledge. But consider how he\nexplains his position, quoted here at some length:\n\n\n[T]he fundamental principles of Ethics must be self-evident. But I am\nanxious that this expression should not be misunderstood. The\nexpression \u201cself-evident\u201d means properly that the\nproposition so called is evident or true, by itself alone;\nthat it is not an inference from some proposition other than\nitself. The expression does not mean that the proposition is\ntrue, because it is evident to you or me or all mankind, because in\nother words it appears to us to be true. That a proposition appears to\nbe true can never be a valid argument that true it really is. By\nsaying that a proposition is self-evident, we mean emphatically that\nits appearing so to us, is not the reason why it is true: for\nwe mean that it has absolutely no reason. It would not be a\nself-evident proposition, if we could say of it: I cannot think\notherwise and therefore it is true. For then its evidence or proof\nwould not lie in itself, but in something else, namely our conviction\nof it. That it appears true to us may indeed be the cause of\nour asserting it, or the reason why we think and say that it is true:\nbut a reason in this sense is something utterly different from a\nlogical reason, or reason why something is true. Moreover, it is\nobviously not a reason of the same thing. The evidence of a\nproposition to us is only a reason for our holding it to be\ntrue; whereas a logical reason, or reason in the sense in which\nself-evident propositions have no reason, is a reason why the\nproposition itself must be true, not why we hold it so to be.\nAgain, that a proposition is evident to us may not only be the\nreason why we do think or affirm it, it may even be a reason\nwhy we ought to think it or affirm it. But a reason, in this sense\ntoo, is not a logical reason for the truth of the proposition, though\nit is a logical reason for the rightness of holding the\nproposition\u2026. When, therefore, I talk of Intuitionistic\nHedonism, I must not be understood to imply that my denial that\n\u201cPleasure is the only good\u201d is based on my\nIntuition of its falsehood. My Intuition of its falsehood is indeed\nmy reason for holding and declaring it untrue; it is\nindeed the only valid reason for so doing. But that is just because\nthere is no logical reason for it; because there is no proper\nevidence or reason of its falsehood except for itself alone. It is\nuntrue, because it is untrue, and there is no other reason: but I\ndeclare it untrue, because its untruth is evident to me, and\nI hold that that is a sufficient reason for my assertion. We must not\ntherefore look on Intuition, as if it were an alternative to\nreasoning. Nothing whatever can take the place of reasons for\nthe truth of any proposition: intuition can only furnish a reason for\nholding any proposition to be true: this however it must do\nwhen any proposition is self-evident, when, in fact, there are no\nreasons which prove its truth. (1903 [2003]: 143\u2013144)\n\n\nNote first that Moore\u2019s conception of self-evidence is of\npropositions whose truth does not depend on anything else; these would\nbe propositions that express a sort of brute fact. Nothing obviously\nfollows about the epistemic status of such propositions or about\nbeliefs in such propositions. In this respect, Moore\u2019s\nconception of self-evidence differs from the standard conception.\nSecond, given his conception of self-evidence, Moore chooses an odd\nexample of a self-evident proposition. For that pleasure is not the\nonly good seems to follow from various propositions regarding\nwhat things are good, propositions that Moore accepted\u2014and that\nare apparently self-evident\u2014e.g., that appreciation of beauty is\ngood.\n\nFinally, to interpret Moore as holding that we are a priori\njustified in accepting fundamental moral principles, one must adopt\nthe modified standard view. And his position nicely illustrates the\nproblem that forces the modification of the standard view. Moore held\nthat what justifies one in believing a fundamental moral principle is\nthat the principle is self-evident and that it appears to be true,\ni.e., that one has an intuition of it. But this intuition, as an\nappearance of truth, is clearly a kind of experience, so it seems that\none\u2019s justification for an intuitive belief in a fundamental\nmoral principle will not be independent of experience. Hence, to\nregard this justification as a priori, one must make an\nexception for this specific kind of experience. While Moore famously\ndenied hedonism, this was because he denied that pleasure is the only\ngood. He accepted that pleasure is good, and this proposition nicely\nillustrates the tension inherent in the modified standard view of\na priori justification, and indeed the standard view, as well\nas Moore\u2019s a priori moral epistemology. Presumably one\nmust experience pleasure to acquire the concept of pleasure. But then\nhow exactly is it that one is justified in believing that pleasure is\ngood? Is it that once one has the concepts of pleasure and goodness,\none believes that pleasure is good simply on the basis of\nunderstanding this proposition? Or is it that once one understands\nthis proposition, one has a rational intuition of its truth? Or is it\ninstead that when one experiences pleasure one also experiences its\ngoodness? If something like the latter, the justification for our\nbelief that pleasure is good seems more empirical than a\npriori.\n\nContrasting Moore\u2019s view with Kant\u2019s might be helpful.\nKant viewed moral knowledge as fundamentally a priori in the\nsense that moral knowledge must be the result of careful reasoning\n(first transcendental, then deductive); one could discover through\nreason the fundamental moral principle, and then deduce from that\nprinciple more specific moral duties. Moore, on the other hand,\nexplicitly rules out reasoning to fundamental moral principles; since\nthese principles are self-evident, Moore denies that there are,\nproperly speaking, any reasons for them. Thus, we find in Moore a\ndistinctively intuitionist account of a priori knowledge, as\nopposed to Kant\u2019s rationalist account. Moore\u2019s account is\nintuitionistic because the reason why we believe, and ought to\nbelieve, fundamental moral principles is that they are self-evident\npropositions that appear true to us.\n\nMoore did not hold that all moral knowledge is intuitive. In the\nPrincipia he maintained that the utilitarian principle was\nanalytic, hence, knowledge of this principle would not require a\nspecial intuition. But he later acknowledged that one cannot define\n\u201cright\u201d, because the open question argument can be used\nagainst definitions of \u201cright\u201d, including the utilitarian\ndefinition. (\u201cThis action produces the most good consequences,\nbut is it right?\u201d is an open question. Corresponding open\nquestions count against efforts to define \u201cought\u201d, e.g.,\n\u201cThis action produces the most good consequences, but ought I do\nit?\u201d) So Moore was driven to hold that the utilitarian principle\nwas synthetic, and known a priori via intuition (Moore 1912).\nHowever, since Moore held that one ought to do what produces\nthe most good, one would have to engage in empirical investigation of\nthe consequences of various types of action to determine what one is\nobligated to do. So on Moore\u2019s view, one would not simply intuit\nthat one ought to keep promises or ought not to kill.\n\nA more interesting reason why Moore did not hold that all moral\nknowledge results from direct intuition was that he denied that\nintuition is infallible. On his view, it can appear to one that a\nfalse moral proposition is self-evidently\n true.[5]\n Thus, according to Moore, it is possible for the moral propositions\none intuits to conflict. One resolves any conflicts among the moral\nprinciples one intuits\u2014e.g., regarding which sorts of things are\ngood\u2014by considerations of coherence, with some intuitions\nregarding what is and is not good being rejected precisely because of\ntheir conflicts with other intuitions. So while a priori\nintuition plays a large role for Moore, he did not hold that one\nattains moral knowledge exclusively by carefully focusing one\u2019s\nattention on various moral propositions and then simply intuiting\nwhether or not they are true.\n3.2 Prima Facie Moral Principles and Intuitionism\n\nW. D. Ross (1930) is for many the paradigm intuitionist (see entry on\n William David Ross).\n He held both pluralism:\n\n(P)\nThere is no single, fundamental moral principle.\n\n\nand intuitionism:\n\n(I)\nWe can have intuitive, a priori knowledge of moral propositions.\n\n\nEven though (P) is not the focus of this entry, it might be useful to\nreview Ross\u2019s position on it. Ross provided principles\nspecifying various grounds of duty by using the concept of prima\nfacie duty. Ross thought of prima facie duty as a\ntendency to be a duty, not as a kind of duty. He held that we have\nprima facie duties to keep promises and tell the truth, to\nprovide reparation for harms we have done, to perform acts of\ngratitude, to insure just distributions, to benefit others, to improve\nourselves, and not to harm others. He held that an act is a prima\nfacie duty in virtue of some one component of its nature, e.g.,\nbeing a promise keeping. But a given act can have more than one\nmorally significant feature, and in virtue of some features it might\nbe prima facie right while also being prima facie\nwrong in virtue of other features. Imagine a mob enforcer has taken a\ncontract to kill someone. The act of fulfilling his contract would be\na prima facie duty in virtue of keeping a promise, but it\nwould be prima facie wrong in virtue of harming, indeed,\nkilling, a person. The act would be wrong all-things-considered.\nOne\u2019s all-things-considered duty, according to Ross, is\ndetermined by the entire nature of an action. Ross held that it is not\npossible to provide a general ranking of prima facie duties\naccording to their stringency, with more stringent duties always\ntrumping less stringent duties if they conflict. And he did not think\nit is possible to provide any other sort of general rule for\ndetermining which prima facie duty will take precedence in\ncases of conflict. Therefore, even if we had a set of principles\nidentifying every prima facie right making feature and every\nprima facie wrong making feature\u2014which Ross did not\nclaim to have provided\u2014and even if we had complete knowledge of\nthe non-moral features of all actions, we could not mechanically\ndeduce which actions we would be duty bound to perform.\n\nTurning now to (I): Ross held that his principles specifying prima\nfacie duties are self-evident. Here is a significant passage from\nRoss articulating his view:\n\n\nThat an act, qua fulfilling a promise, or qua\n\u2026, is prima facie right, is self-evident; not in the\nsense that it is evident from the beginning of our lives, or as soon\nas we attend to the proposition for the first time, but in the sense\nthat when we have reached sufficient mental maturity and have given\nsufficient attention to the proposition it is evident without any need\nof proof, or of evidence beyond itself. It is self-evident just as a\nmathematical axiom, or the validity of a form of inference, is\nevident\u2026. In our confidence that these propositions are true\nthere is involved the same trust in our reason that is involved in our\nconfidence in mathematics; and we should have no justification for\ntrusting it in the latter sphere and distrusting it in the former. In\nboth cases we are dealing with propositions that cannot be proved, but\njust as certainly need no proof. (1930: 29\u201330) \n\n\nRoss here not only provides some clarification of his notion of\nself-evidence, but also commits himself to a number of theses that are\ntypical of, or typically associated with, intuitionism (meaning (I)\nspecifically). By identifying these theses, we can begin to get a\nclearer picture of Ross\u2019s intuitionism.\n\nRoss claims that some propositions regarding prima facie\nduties are self-evident. However, as Ross understands the\nself-evidence of moral propositions, it is both stronger and weaker\nthan it is according to (SE).\n\nThe self-evidence Ross attributes to moral propositions is weaker in\nthat whereas on (SE) a self-evident proposition will be evident for\nany person who understands it, according to Ross a self-evident moral\nproposition is evident for any person who has attained sufficient\nmental maturity and given the proposition sufficient attention. Hence,\non Ross\u2019s conception, a self-evident proposition,\nPSE, might not be justified for some, and perhaps\neven many, who understand it; PSE may not be evident\nto persons who understand it if they either lack sufficient mental\nmaturity or have not considered PSE\n sufficiently.[6]\n Depending upon what is required for sufficient mental maturity and\nsufficient consideration, self-evident moral propositions might be\nevident, in virtue of their self-evidence, for precious few actual\nindividuals. Here\u2019s one way to think about it: Rossian\nself-evidence has less epistemic potency\u2014a person must satisfy\nmore conditions for a self-evident moral proposition to be evident\nthan merely understanding it.\n\nIf the requirements for sufficient maturity and consideration are\nminimal, then there will be little difference between self-evidence as\ndefined by Ross and (SE). But Ross\u2019s approach would include a\n\u201cfudge factor\u201d that might be useful. It could, e.g.,\nenable him to avoid purported counterexamples where S\nunderstands some self-evident moral proposition,\nPSE, but we are disinclined to grant that\nPSE is justified for S either because\nS suffers from some general cognitive deficiency, e.g.,\nexcessive credulity, or the circumstances in which S\nunderstands P are problematic for some reason, e.g., S\nis exhausted or distracted. Ross could simply point out that S\nlacks mental maturity or has failed to give PSE\nsufficient consideration, and thereby avoid having to say that\nS has a justification for PSE.\n\nRoss\u2019s more restricted conception of self-evidence has another\npotential advantage. We were all taught about morality. When children,\nwe were told, \u201cDon\u2019t hit!\u201d \u201cShare your\ntoys\u201d, \u201cYou ought not lie\u201d, etc. And when older,\nmost of us encountered situations where it was not clear to us what we\nshould do, so we sought the advice of someone we trusted. In some of\nthese cases the moral propositions at issue may have been\nself-evident, but at first the truth of these propositions was not\nobvious to us, so we believed on the basis of testimony. One might\naddress these moral cases in the way we\u2019ve suggested the\nstandard story could address analogous logical and mathematical cases.\nThat way of addressing the cases is not obviously mistaken, but one\nmight balk at the thought that a person who understands a self-evident\nproposition automatically has a justification for that proposition\neven before it is apparent to the person that the proposition is\ntrue.\n\nRoss\u2019s stronger requirements for self-evidence might provide a\nmore satisfactory account. Since on his view self-evident propositions\nare evident for any person who has attained sufficient mental maturity\nand given the propositions sufficient consideration, he could deny\nthat a child first being taught simple moral principles has a\njustification for these principles and deny that a math student who\nhas been introduced to an \u201cobvious\u201d truth, but has not yet\nhad a chance to give it any consideration, would have a justification\nfor the truth. Ross could make the more plausible claim that if we had\na justification for these propositions at first, it was only because\nof testimony. We did not, at first, have justifications for these\npropositions on our own. Later, when we were mature and had given\nthese propositions due consideration, they would be evident to us on\ntheir own.\n\nRoss\u2019s conception of self-evidence is stronger than the standard\nunderstanding because he held self-evident propositions are certain.\nIn the passage quoted, Ross does not explicitly claim that\nself-evident propositions are certain, but he suggests they\nare when he claims that self-evident moral propositions are like\nmathematical axioms and logical truths. And two paragraphs later he\nexplicitly claims that our judgments regarding prima facie\nduties are certain. (SE) asserts only that self-evident propositions\nare evident, not that they are certain.\n\nThree more elements of Ross\u2019s view deserve mention. First, the\nstandard story has it that self-evident propositions can be\njustified without additional evidence, but does not rule out being\njustified in believing a self-evident proposition on the basis of\nevidence or even proof. But Ross claims that self-evident propositions\ncannot be proved.\n\nSecond, Ross allowed that a person might come to be justified in\nbelieving one of his general principles regarding prima facie\nduties via what is sometimes called \u201cintuitive induction\u201d.\nOne recognizes prima facie duties in particular cases first,\nand then comes to apprehend the general principle. Thus, for example,\none intuits in a number of particular cases where one has promised,\nthat one has a prima facie obligation to do what one has\npromised, and then one \u201csees\u201d that one has a prima\nfacie obligation to keep promises. Intuitive induction is\nsupposed to produce a priori knowledge. When one knows on the\nbasis of an intuitive induction the justification for the general\nprinciple is not derived from one\u2019s justifications regarding the\nparticular cases, as one would be in a standard enumerative induction.\nSince Ross held that principles regarding prima facie duties\nare self-evident, he was committed to the claim that their\njustification does not depend upon anything else. So the idea must\ninstead be that thinking about the particular cases either enables one\nto truly understand the general principle or is involved in giving it\nsufficient consideration, whereupon one comes to see that it is\ntrue.\n\nThird, Ross denied that propositions regarding all-things-considered\nduties in particular cases are self-evident. Indeed, he denied that\none can know what one\u2019s all-things-considered duty is in any\nactual case; he held that this was a matter of \u201cprobable\nopinion\u201d. In Ross\u2019s view, a prima facie duty\nresults from some one property of an action, e.g., that it is a\npromise keeping or that it benefits some person. But one\u2019s\nall-things-considered duty results from the entire nature of an\naction. So one reason we cannot know our all-things-considered duty is\nthat we cannot know whether we have identified all the features of an\naction that are morally relevant. And even if we could, there is the\nadditional problem that prima facie duties can conflict, and\nit is not self-evident how such conflicts should be resolved.\n4. A Priori Justification and Late 20th Century Naturalism\n\nWhile hugely influential, Moore\u2019s open question argument is far\nfrom unassailable. One influential response points out that it\nimplausibly assumes any correct definition or analysis must be\nobvious. According to this response, the open question argument\nimplausibly assumes the correct response to the paradox of analysis is\nto deny that any analysis could be both correct and informative (see\nentry on\n analysis).\n So, the open question argument is no longer taken as decisive. In\naddition, a majority of philosophers do not want to admit non-natural\nentities into their ontologies. Finally, many judge that\nnon-cognitivist and anti-realist theories cannot really do justice to\nthe status of morality. It therefore is no surprise that naturalist\nethical theories, which hold that moral properties and facts just are\nnatural properties and facts, gained prominence towards the end of the\n20th century. One such view, analytic naturalism, directly\ncontradicts Moore by holding that all ethical terms have naturalistic\nanalyses. It might seem that a priori justification would\nplay a prominent role in at least those naturalistic theories that\noffer analyses of moral terms, but as we will see, this is\nnot so obvious (see entry on\n moral naturalism).\n\nWe will focus primarily on the role of the a priori in\nanalytic naturalism. However, perhaps a good entry point into the view\nis via comparison with a very different view: Cornell realism.\n4.1 Cornell Realism\n\nCornell realism (so named because its best known proponents are\nassociated with Cornell University) is a version of naturalistic\nrealism; it holds that there are moral properties (and thus moral\nfacts), but that moral properties are natural properties.\n\nEpistemologically, there are two significant features of Cornell\nrealism. First, it accepts a coherence theory of justification.\nSecond, it applies to moral epistemology the claim from the philosophy\nof science that observations are theory-laden. According to\ncoherentism, beliefs are not justified individually, but holistically,\nin virtue of their membership in a coherent system of beliefs.\nEspecially within ethics, a coherent system of beliefs is often\nreferred to as being in a state of \u201creflective\nequilibrium\u201d (see entry on\n reflective equilibrium).\n The term \u201creflective equilibrium\u201d is also used to refer\nto an idealized method via which inquirers bring their moral beliefs\ninto coherence by reflecting on their considered moral judgments and\ngeneral principles intended to capture these judgments, and\neliminating any conflicts that emerge by making adjustments to either\nthe considered judgments or the general principles. Neither considered\nmoral judgments nor general principles are always favored. What the\ninquirer revises in each case of conflict is determined by what seems\nmost likely to be true to the inquirer. A number of commentators on\nreflective equilibrium have observed that it is a sophisticated\ncontemporary version of intuitionism in which considered moral\njudgments, or more properly, the considered judgments and moral\nprinciples that seem most likely to be true, play essentially the same\nrole in determining the moral theory eventually accepted that\nself-evident moral intuitions did for earlier intuitionists.\nReflective equilibrium may allow for initially credible considered\njudgments and moral principles to be revised more than one would\nexpect to see traditionally understood intuitions being revised, but\nin the end what seems to be true upon reflection determines the system\nof judgments and principles accepted in reflective equilibrium. Hence,\none might be tempted to assume that those who accept reflective\nequilibrium, such as Cornell realists, are committed to a\npriori justification playing a significant role in moral\nepistemology even though what plays the role of intuitions is not\nassumed to be self-evident. As we will see, this temptation should be\nresisted.\n\nLet\u2019s begin by noting that one influential criticism of\nreflective equilibrium is that what seem to function as intuitions are\njust what seem to the inquirer to be true; there is not even the\npretense that these have some special status, such as self-evidence.\nEarlier intuitionists might be criticized for claiming propositions\nare self-evident when they are not. But reflective equilibrium may\nlead inquirers to do nothing more than build a coherent moral system\naround strongly held beliefs that in fact have no positive epistemic\nstatus. (We cannot pursue this criticism further but for an important\nearly response see Daniels 1979).\n\nObservation of the vapor tracks made by charged particles in a cloud\nchamber is a favorite example used to illustrate theory-laden\nobservation. A scientist could not observe, say, a positron, if the\nscientist did not already believe various theories, e.g., regarding\nsub atomic particles and how such particles will affect the medium in\nthe cloud chamber when they pass through it. But this does not mean\nthat experienced scientists make a theory-neutral observation of what\nhappens in a cloud chamber and then draw inferences regarding the sub\natomic particles from their theories and the theory-neutral\nobservation. That might have been what scientists had to do early on\nin the development of the cloud chamber and the relevant theories. But\nnow when experienced scientists watch what happens in a cloud chamber,\nthey will spontaneously and non-inferentially form beliefs about\npositrons, muons and the like; such spontaneous beliefs are real\nobservations. Experienced scientists make such observations in just\nthe way an ordinary person might observe a dog or cat in the front\nyard.\n\nCornell realists hold that the same thing happens in the moral realm.\nWe all hold what is in effect a moral theory. The reasons we come to\nhold the theory initially are not important, so long as the theory is\nclose enough to the truth. Richard Boyd (1988), for instance, suggests\nthat our background moral theory identifies moral goodness with those\nproperties that are conducive to the satisfaction of human needs, both\nphysical and psychological. Having internalized this theory, we are\nable to make moral observations. For example, when we see photographs\nof the prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison during the American\noccupation of Iraq we certainly recognize that treating persons in the\nways depicted frustrates some significant psychological needs. But\nthis will not be our primary reaction. When we view these photographs\nwe spontaneously judge that the treatment of the prisoners was wrong\nor abusive (where it should be emphasized that the latter involves a\nstrong moral component). This spontaneous moral belief may be\ndependent upon our background moral views; if we did not accept some\nmoral theory we would not have made it. But, according to the Cornell\nrealists, the belief is still an observation because it is\ntheory-laden rather than being inferred from a theory conjoined with\nvarious non-moral observations. It is what happens in science, and as\nin science, the fact that moral observations are theory-laden does not\nprevent them from helping to support our moral theory. As in science,\nexplanatory relations are important, e.g., the fact that the prisoners\nat Abu Ghraib were wrongly treated, where this fact of being wrongly\ntreated is something like the natural fact of their being seriously\nharmed, is part of the best explanation of our observing that what was\ndone to them was wrong. On this view, neither the moral theory nor the\nmoral observations are epistemologically prior; both are justified in\nvirtue of the coherence of the entire system of moral beliefs.\n\nThe interesting feature of Cornell realism, for our purposes, is that\ndespite the fact that spontaneous moral beliefs\u2014that some refer\nto as intuitions\u2014play a significant role, a priori\njustification plays no significant role in its moral epistemology.\nBoth our more particular moral beliefs and our moral theories will be\njustified in virtue of their coherence, not their self-evidence; the\nconsidered moral judgments that are significant members of the\ncoherent system of moral beliefs, and that some see as old-fashioned\nintuitions, are interpreted as observations, not rational insights.\nFor Cornell realism, the justification of our moral beliefs crucially\ndepends upon experience, specifically, moral observation.\n4.2 Analytic Naturalism\n\nCornell realism holds that moral properties cannot be a\npriori analyzed as any natural properties, though they can be\nempirically discovered to be identical to certain natural properties.\nIn contrast, analytic naturalism holds that moral properties can be\nanalyzed in terms of natural properties. One influential version of\nanalytic naturalism applies to moral properties a strategy that was\ndeveloped for dealing with mental properties, which is why the view is\nalso called moral functionalism, flagging the similarity to\nfunctionalism in the philosophy of mind. We will focus on this version\nof analytic naturalism, specifically Frank Jackson\u2019s (1998)\nexposition. (For another version see Stephen Finlay 2014.)\n\nTo a first approximation, analytic naturalism holds the following:\nThere are many statements containing moral terms that we find obvious\nor intuitive\u2014moral platitudes, if you will. These statements\nconstitute a sort of folk moral theory. Here are some examples:\n\u201cintentional killing is normally wrong\u201d, \u201cpain is\nbad\u201d, \u201cvirtuous people are more likely to do the right\nthing than vicious people\u201d, \u201ca person who judges that she\nought to do something normally feels some motivation to do it\u201d.\nCollectively, such statements fix the reference of moral terms, i.e.,\nthey determine what moral terms refer to. If a person denied enough of\nthese statements, we would conclude that the person did not use moral\nterms with the same meaning as the rest of us. According to analytic\nnaturalism, moral terms have their meaning holistically, as a result\nof the role they play in the system of moral statements that make up\nfolk morality. Significantly, many of these statements relate moral\nproperties to each other, as does the statement that virtuous people\nare more likely to do the right thing.\n\nThere is an immediate problem. Since current folk morality is made up\nof all the moral statements that many people find obvious, given the\nlevel of moral disagreement, folk morality is unlikely to be\nconsistent. If it contains inconsistent statements folk morality will\nnot be able to determine the reference of moral terms, since an\ninconsistent description does not apply to anything. Moreover, parts\nof it that seem obvious to many people are likely to be grounded in\nsuperstitions, depend upon empirical views that are mistaken, and in\nvarious other ways not be able to stand up to critical reflection. So\ncurrent folk morality must be cleaned up. One way to think about\ncleaning up folk morality is as trying to bring it into reflective\nequilibrium. But however it is done, the point is to mold current folk\nmorality into a coherent, reflectively defensible system of moral\nbeliefs: a mature folk morality. Analytic naturalism claims that the\nmeaning of moral terms is given by the role they occupy in the\nstatements that constitute mature folk morality.\n\nTo see more specifically how this works, imagine writing down all the\nstatements of mature folk morality as one long conjunction.\nSimplifying, suppose mature folk morality consists of only the first\nthree examples above:\n\n\nIntentional killing is normally wrong and pain is\nbad and virtuous people are more likely to do the right thing\nthan vicious people. \n\n\nWe can transform these statements so that they explicitly reference\nmoral properties and replace each moral property term with a distinct\nvariable:\n\n\nIntentional killings normally have the property w and\npain has the property b and people with the\nproperty v1 are more likely to perform actions\nhaving the property r than people having the property\nv2. \n\n\nWe then bind all these variables with existential quantifiers to\nget:\n\n\nThere exists a property w and a property b and a\nproperty v1 and a property r and a property\nv2 such that intentional killings normally have\nthe property w and pain has the property b\nand people with the property v1 are more likely\nto perform actions having the property r than people having the\nproperty v2. \n\n\nWe now have a sentence that says there are five properties that\nfulfill the roles played by the moral properties we began with. But\nthat\u2019s not good enough to single out moral properties by their\nplaying these roles, since there might be other properties that also\nplay these roles. To exclude this possibility, we need to add a claim\nsaying that only one property plays each role, i.e., a clause that\nstates that any property that makes all the statements containing\nw true is identical to w, any property that makes all\nthe sentences containing b true is identical to b, and\nso on. We can abbreviate this clause as Uniqueness. It is now\npossible to define any moral term using the complicated sentence we\nhave just constructed. For example:\n\n\nWrongness is the property w such that: there exists a property\nb and a property v1 and a property r\nand a property v2 such that intentional killings\nnormally have the property w and pain has the property\nb and people with the property v1\nare more likely to perform actions having the property r than\npeople having the property v2 and\nUniqueness. \n\n\nThe claim that this simple statement correctly analyzes wrongness is\nnot very plausible. But that is because we simplified, including only\nthree statements from mature folk morality. Analytic naturalism holds\nthat the extremely complex sentences constructed in the same way using\nall of mature folk morality provide analyses of moral terms.\nThis position is much more plausible, although still\ncontroversial.\n\nOne might at this point question why the analyses of moral terms\nanalytic naturalism constructs would be naturalistic, i.e., define\nmoral terms in purely \u201cdescriptive\u201d terms, given that the\nroles played by moral terms are partly determined by their relations\nto other moral terms. A crucial element of the view that we must now\nexplain addresses this question. Analytic naturalism holds that a\ncentral tenet of folk morality is that moral properties\nsupervene on natural properties. This means that it is\nimpossible for two situations to differ morally without there also\nbeing some natural difference. Jackson argues that the supervenience\nof the moral on the natural, or as he prefers, on the\n\u201cdescriptive\u201d, entails that moral properties are natural\nproperties.\n\nTake any ethical statement E. Since moral properties are\nsupervenient or consequent upon descriptive properties, no\npossible world where E is true can be made up only of moral\nfacts. There will also have to be descriptive facts about this world,\nso there will be a sentence, likely an extremely long and complex\nsentence, that completely specifies the descriptive facts about the\nworld. There will be such a purely descriptive sentence for every\npossible world where E is true. Let these sentences be\nD1, D2, D3,\n\u2026 We can disjoin all these descriptive sentences to get\nD = (D1 or D2 or\nD3 or \u2026). D will also be a descriptive\nsentence; it is made up entirely of descriptive sentences put together\nusing \u201cor\u201d, which is not a moral term.\n\nNow, although it is an odd sentence\u2014a very long\ndisjunction\u2014there is an important fact about D: it\nentails E and it is entailed by E. If E is true,\nthen one of the disjuncts of D must be true, because D\ncontains a disjunct describing every world where E is true;\nhence, D will be true as well. On the other hand, if D\nis true, then one of its disjuncts must be true, say it is\nDn. E could not be false in a world\ndescribed by Dn because\nDn is included as a disjunct of D.\nHence, if E were false in a world described by\nDn it would be possible for there to be two\nworlds that were exactly alike in all descriptive respects with the\nmoral statement E being true in one of these worlds but false\nin the other. The supervenience of the moral on the descriptive tells\nus that this cannot happen\u2014there can be no moral difference\nunless there is some descriptive difference. So D entails\nE.\n\nJackson concludes,\n\n\nThe same line of argument can be applied mutatis mutandis to\nethical and descriptive predicates and open sentences: for any ethical\npredicate there is a purely descriptive one that is necessarily\nco-extensive with it. \n\n\n\nIt follows that ethical properties are descriptive properties. (1998:\n122\u2013123) \n\n\nOne could question Jackson\u2019s assumption that necessarily\nco-extensive properties are the same, but we cannot here pursue that\nissue. What analytical naturalism offers so far is an analysis of\nmoral terms and an argument that moral properties are natural, or\ndescriptive. But exactly which descriptive properties are identical to\nthe moral properties? Analytic naturalism does not tell us this now.\nIt claims that once we have attained a mature folk morality, we will\nbe able to determine which natural properties fulfill (closely enough)\nthe roles of the various moral\n properties.[7]\n\nGiven that analytic naturalism provides analyses of moral\nterms\u2014more exactly, a procedure for constructing such analyses\nonce we have a mature folk morality\u2014one might conclude that\nvarious moral propositions will be a priori justified, most\nsignificantly, the definitions of moral terms. Jackson claims as much.\nExplaining the \u201ca priori\u201d supervenience of moral\non descriptive properties, e.g., he writes, \n\n\nIt is an implicit part \u2026 of our understanding of ethical terms\nand sentences that they serve to mark distinctions among the\ndescriptive ways things are. (1998: 125) \n\n\nHe also claims that the characterization of the role played by\nrightness and the other moral terms in mature folk morality is a\npriori while the identification of exactly which natural\nproperties play these roles is a posteriori, since this would\nrequire empirical investigation. Jackson describes mature folk\nmorality as \n\n\nthe best we will do by way of making good sense of the raft of\nsometimes conflicting intuitions about particular cases and general\nprinciples that make up current folk morality. (1998: 133) \n\n\nMature folk morality is just the result of subjecting current folk\nmorality to sustained critical reflection.\n\nIt is worth noting, however, that although Jackson\u2019s description\nof the status of the supervenience of the moral on the natural is\nsuggestive, he does not explicitly claim that even this is\nself-evident. Although his descriptions of folk morality, e.g., as\n\n\n\nthe network of moral opinions, intuitions, principles and concepts\nwhose mastery is part and parcel of having a sense of what is right\nand wrong, and of being able to engage in meaningful debate about what\nought to be done (1998: 130) \n\n\nsuggest that one could determine, a priori, the content of\nfolk morality, folk morality is also clearly something held by a\ncommunity of people rather than an individual. This suggests that\nempirical inquiry would be needed to determine what belongs to the\nfolk morality of a community, including even the community to which\none belongs. Finally, there is the critical reflection that produces\nmature folk morality. Jackson does not describe this reflection in\nmuch detail. He mentions reflective equilibrium as one example, but\nreflective equilibrium is understood in various ways, and most include\nempirical elements. So while there are some reasons to think\nanalytical naturalism allows for significant a priori moral\njustification and knowledge, there are also grounds for doubt. (For an\nargument that analytic naturalists must make use of a priori\nequivalences between moral and descriptive features, see Smith\n2000.)\n5. Moral Particularism and Justification\n\nMoral particularists accept some disambiguation of at least one of the\nfollowing two theses:\n\n There exist no true moral principles.\n One should not use moral principles in the course of moral\ndeliberation.\n\n\nIf any version of the first thesis is true, then a fortiori\nthere is no a priori knowledge of any moral principle, since\nthere are no true moral principles. Moreover, particularists who\naccept the first thesis are distinct from Rossians in that they reject\nthe existence of true pro tanto moral principles such as that\npromise-keeping is a pro tanto duty. (Contemporary\nparticularists, and moral philosophers more generally, tend to prefer\n\u2018pro tanto\u2019 to Ross\u2019s \u2018prima\nfacie\u2019, which even Ross admitted was unsatisfactory\nimmediately upon introducing it. The problem with \u2018prima\nfacie\u2019 is that it means at first glance, but a\nprima facie duty is not something that seems to be a duty at\nfirst glance, but something that would be a duty if it is not\noverridden in some way. \u2018Pro tanto\u2019 means to\nthat extent, and a pro tanto duty is something that\nwould be a duty sans phrase, if it were not overridden in\nsome way.) Thus, particularists believe that one cannot know a\npriori any pro tanto principle. However, as we\u2019ll\nsee, these particularists nevertheless think one can attain knowledge,\neven a priori knowledge, of particular moral facts.\n\nMost particularists also accept the second thesis. In some cases,\nparticularists accept the second thesis because they accept the first\n(Dancy 2005, McDowell 1979). In other cases, particularists reject the\nfirst thesis but accept the second: they admit that there are some\ntrue moral principles, but hold that those principles are nevertheless\nnot the sorts of things that should play a role in\ndeliberation (Guarini 2006). However, all particularists who accept\nthe second thesis tend to adopt a similar moral\nepistemology\u2014let\u2019s call the second thesis\n\u201cabstinence\u201d.\n\nThere are other particularists who accept the first thesis and reject\nthe second, and admit that there are some false moral\nprinciples\u2014distinct from pro tanto moral\nprinciples\u2014that are appropriate to use in some deliberative\nsituations (Little 2000). Let\u2019s call this view \u201crule of\nthumb\u201d particularism.\n5.1 Abstinence\n\nJonathan Dancy accepts versions of both the first and second thesis,\nand he accepts the second thesis in part because he accepts the first.\nDancy holds that there are two types of principles: absolute\nand contributory. An absolute moral principle specifies a\nsufficient condition for the instantiation of a moral property, while\na contributory moral principle specifies that a feature has an\nintrinsic moral valence (see entry on\n Dancy\u2019s moral particularism).\n Dancy holds that neither sort of true principle exists, and thus\nneither sort of principle can properly play a role in moral\ndeliberation\u2014after all, using false moral principles could lead\nus to act correctly for the wrong reasons, or to act incorrectly\n(Dancy 2005: 3).\n\nMoreover, Dancy holds that neither sort of principle is necessary for\nresponsible moral deliberation. In this respect, Dancy\u2019s view is\nsimilar to Moore\u2019s, albeit only on the level of particular moral\nfacts. According to Dancy, morally sensitive people can intuit the\nmorally relevant features in a context, thereby intuiting the moral\nreasons in that context, and reliably come to a correct moral\nconclusion about how they ought to act, even without the use of a\nprinciple that specifies how to weigh one\u2019s reasons. (In this\nlatter respect, Dancy\u2019s view is also similar to Ross\u2019s.)\nIn some cases, Dancy has suggested that we can understand this\ndeliberative process by looking to connectionist machines or Roschian\nprototype theory (Dancy 1999).\n\nParticularists rarely put their account of moral knowledge in terms of\njustification. But when particularists do put their view in terms of\njustification (see below) they claim that the justification involved\nis a priori. The thought seems to be this: if one can issue a\nmoral verdict in a particular case on the basis of the moral reasons\none is presented with in that case, then one must know what those\nreasons are, as well as how to weigh them to reach a verdict. But,\naccording to particularists, there are no principles one can use to\nknow those things; thus, one must see\u2014through the exercise of\nintuition\u2014what one\u2019s reasons are and how to weigh them\nagainst each other. That is, one must intuit propositions such as\nR is a reason to \u03c6 in this case and In this\ncase, on balance, the reasons support \u03c6-ing. Particularists\nseem committed to a version of the modified standard view of a\npriori justification. There is a distinct experience of rational\n\u201cseeing\u201d\u201d in virtue of which one is a\npriori justified in believing these propositions regarding a\nparticular case. If the propositions one is thereby justified in\nbelieving are self-evident, it seems that they are self-evident only\nin the attenuated sense that it is possible to have rational insight\ninto their truth, and hence possible to be justified in believing\nthem, solely on the basis of understanding them and thinking about\nthem. It is also worth taking note that the moral propositions\nparticularists hold that we are a priori justified in\nbelieving are relative to a particular context: what one can come to\nsee is that something is a reason to \u03c6 for a particular agent in a\nparticular situation or that the balance of reasons support \u03c6-ing\nfor this particular agent in this particular situation.\n\nThe role of past experience in present moral deliberation complicates\nthe particularist\u2019s claim that moral beliefs are justified a\npriori. On the one hand, particularists claim that past\nexperience plays an important role in deliberation, even for the\nmorally mature agent\u2014for instance, one often judges that\nR is a reason in the present context because R was a\nreason in a relevantly similar context in the past (see the entry on\n Dancy\u2019s moral particularism).\n But on the other hand, the belief one arrives at through this kind of\nreflection on past experience is nevertheless a priori,\naccording to particularists. How can we make sense of the conjunction\nof these two claims?\n\nPerhaps we can try to answer this question by looking at what\nabstinence particularists\u2014Dancy in particular\u2014have to say\nabout Kant. Dancy writes that particularists agree with Kant that\nmoral judgments are synthetic a priori. According to Dancy,\nKant inferred from this that moral judgments must also be necessary\nand universal (2007); but particularists reject this inference, and\nhold that moral judgments are synthetic a priori and yet are\ncontingent and particular. Dancy writes,\n\n\nDoes it follow from this [that moral facts are contingent and not\nuniversal] that they [moral facts] are not knowable a priori?\nI don\u2019t think so. After all, even when all the empirical\ninformation\u2014that is, the information that we think of as\nordinarily available to the senses\u2014is in, we still have to\ndetermine which aspects of the present situation, as revealed to us in\nexperience, count which way as reasons. That decision seems to take us\nbeyond anything that the senses can inform us about\u2026. Even if\nwe have the benefit of previous experience [that in the past, the fact\nthat I was dealing with someone in distress was a reason to go\ngently]\u2026, the most we can get out of that is the recognition\nthat her distress is probably a reason. Now this sort of\nknowledge would only be a posteriori if the evidence on which\nit is based is a posteriori. And that just returns us to the\nprimary question here: in a case where we don\u2019t have the benefit\nof previous experience, is the \u201cprocess\u201d by which we come\nto recognize that her distress is a reason, one that can be thought of\nas taking us from a posteriori knowledge (that she is in\ndistress) to another a posteriori knowledge (that her\ndistress is a reason to go gently)? And the answer seems to me to be\nno. If our decision that it is a reason is capable of counting as\nknowledge, then, it seems that it will have to be a priori\nknowledge that is at issue, since we only have two choices\u2014a\npriori and a posteriori\u2014and the latter is ruled\nout. (Dancy 2007) \n\n\nDancy appears to endorse this argument:\n\n If I come to know/justifiably believe a moral\nproposition, then I\u2019m either relying on past moral experience or\nI\u2019m not.\n If I\u2019m not relying on past moral\nexperience, then my conclusion is not known/justified a\nposteriori.\n An item of knowledge/a justified belief is either\nknown/justified a priori or a posteriori.\n Thus, if I\u2019m not relying on past moral\nexperience, then my conclusion is known/justified a priori.\n(2, 3)\n If I\u2019m relying on past experience and the past\nconclusions I\u2019m relying on are known/justified a\npriori, then my present conclusion is known/justified a\npriori.\n Thus, if I\u2019m relying on past moral experience,\nthen my conclusion is known/justified a priori. (4, 5)\n Thus, if I come to know/justifiably believe a moral\nproposition, my knowledge/justification is a priori. (1, 4,\n6)\n\n\nThe contentious premises in this argument are premises\n 5\n and\n 2.\n One might offer the following sort of counterexample to\n premise 5.\n Let\u2019s say that in the past, I\u2019ve added together many\npairs of even numbers; and in each of those cases, I\u2019ve\nknown/justifiably believed (a priori) that the sum of the two\nnumbers was also even. Then someone asks me: is it always the case\nthat the sum of two even numbers is itself even? Assume that, for\nwhatever reason, I\u2019m genuinely uncertain of the answer\u2014I\ndon\u2019t see the answer intuitively, or perhaps I doubt my more\ngeneral mathematical intuitions. Nevertheless, I realize that in the\npast, whenever I\u2019ve added two even numbers the sum has itself\nbeen even. Thus, I inductively infer that the hypothesis is correct:\nthe sum of two even numbers is always itself even.\n\nThis example seems like a paradigm case of one coming to\nknow/justifiably believe an a priori proposition a\nposteriori. So, with the distinction between an a priori\nproposition\u2014a proposition amenable to a priori\njustification\u2014and a priori justification/knowledge in\nplace, one might be tempted to reject\n premise 5.\n\nMoreover, more support is needed for\n premise 2.\n Many paradigm cases of a posteriori justification do not\nrely on past experience. Take, for example, your belief that the\ntraffic light is red. Past experience, in this case, only provides you\nwith the relevant concepts needed to understand the proposition\nthe traffic light is red. What justifies your belief is the\ncurrent experience of the traffic light\u2019s being red\u2014and\nsurely this yields a posteriori justification! Perhaps Dancy\ncould say something like this: if I infer a moral claim from an\nempirical matter of fact (as when I infer that the fact that I\u2019m\ndealing with someone in distress is a reason to go gently on the basis\nof my experience of her distress), then I\u2019m going beyond my\nempirical experience in a way that\u2019s different from when I infer\nthat the traffic light is red on the basis of my empirical experience.\nBut Dancy would need to say more about this distinction to explain why\nthe former is an example of a priori justification and the\nlatter an example of a posteriori justification. (For further\narguments against the particularist\u2019s claim that it\u2019s\npossible to have a priori knowledge of particular, contingent moral\nfacts, see McKeever and Ridge 2006, especially chapter 7.)\n\nNevertheless, Dancy\u2019s take on Kant, in spite of his\nargument\u2019s weaknesses, gives us some insight into how Dancy must\nsee the role of experience in a priori justification. Dancy\nmust think that when I infer on the basis of my current experience of\na particular situation that R is a reason to \u03c6, my\ninference is different from the kinds of inferences that yield a\nposteriori justification, and for this reason particularism is\ncompatible with moral knowledge being a priori.\n5.2 Rule of Thumb Particularism\n\nAccording to rule of thumb particularists, one need not give up the\nuse of all moral principles in moral deliberation, because there are\nsome false moral principles that are reasonable to employ. Margaret\nLittle, for instance, thinks that there are no true moral principles\n(not even principles that express pro tanto reasons or\nobligations), but that there are false, defeasible principles that can\nnevertheless provide presumptive epistemic warrant for moral beliefs.\nLittle holds that we can know with reasonable certainty\u2014on the\nbasis of experience and testimony\u2014what sorts of contexts\nwe\u2019re likely to encounter, as well as which features tend to\ncount as reasons (and for what) in those sorts of contexts. She\nwrites,\n\n\nThe judgement that a given principle such as \u201clying is\nwrong\u201d will help rather than mislead a moral novice reflects a\njudgment about the sorts of contexts she is likely to encounter, just\nas our agreement that it is better training to tell beginner drivers\n\u201cNever slam on the brakes\u201d instead of \u201cStomp on the\ngas whenever you see another car\u201d reflects a judgement that the\nstudent will most likely be facing our world of crowded highways and\nnot the post-apocalyptic world of Mad Max movies. (Little 2000: 295)\n\n\n\nThis view\u2014that there are defeasible moral principles we can\nlegitimately use in deliberation\u2014may seem at odds with the\nparticularist claim that there are no pro tanto moral\nprinciples. However, Little sees no such tension. The existence of a\nprinciple that expresses a pro tanto reason or obligation\nentails that certain features have intrinsic moral natures that give\nthem a default \u201cmoral valence\u201d. To say, \u201cLying is\npro tanto wrong\u201d, is to assert that lying has a default\nnegative moral valence, that the feature of being a lie in and of\nitself makes an action worse, even if that feature\u2019s moral\ncontribution could be outweighed by other considerations. However,\naccording to Little, the existence of defeasible generalizations\ndoesn\u2019t entail any such thing; it simply turns out that lying\ntends to be wrong in the contexts most humans tend to encounter, even\nthough lying, in and of itself, has no intrinsic moral valence. Since\nthe latter is (close to) a mere defeasible statistical generalization,\nits use can allow one to justifiably come to moral beliefs even though\n(a) it\u2019s strictly false and (b) it strictly says nothing about\nthe intrinsic moral nature of a property.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say that Little thinks this is the only way we\ncome to hold justified moral beliefs\u2014perhaps we could achieve\nmoral knowledge or justification by engaging in a cognitive process\nlike that described by Dancy (a process by which one intuits, in a\ncontext, what the reasons in the context are and how one ought to\nweight them against each other). But Little does think that\nparticularism will be too demanding if it requires that one form all\nmoral beliefs in the way Abstinence prescribes.\n\nTo sum up, rule of thumb moral particularism makes room for a\nposteriori moral knowledge and a posteriori moral\njustification. Although it leaves open the possibility that some moral\nknowledge and justification is a priori (in the way Dancy\ndescribes), it denies that all moral knowledge/justification is a\npriori; rule of thumb particularists hold that one can\njustifiably infer at least some moral conclusions from experience,\ntestimony, and (experience-supported) beliefs about the kinds of\ncontexts one is likely to encounter.\n6. A Priori Justification and Early 21st Century Intuitionism\n\nEthical intuitionism fell on hard times in the second half of the\n20th century. But as the century closed and moving into the\n21st century, a number of able defenders of the view came\nforward, e.g., Robert Audi (2004), Michael Huemer (2005), Russ\nShafer-Landau (2005), Ralph Wedgwood (2007) and John Bengstrom,\nTerence Cuneo, and Russ Shafer-Landau (2019). (For good introductions\nto the recent discussion of intuitionism see Stratton-Lake 2002 and\nthe entry on\n intuitionism in ethics.)\n Perhaps the resurgence of ethical intuitionism is in part a result of\nthe increased attention philosophers have been paying to the role of\nintuition in philosophical inquiry more broadly. (A good starting\npoint for this topic is provided by the essays in DePaul and Ramsey\n1998, and see the entry on\n intuition.)\n We will close with an examination of the version of this \u201cnew\nintuitionism\u201d presented by Audi\u2014which he calls\n\u201cmoderate rationalist intuitionism\u201d (Audi\n2020)\u2014focusing on the epistemological side of his position.\n\nAudi\u2019s version of intuitionism is very much in the spirit of the\nearlier intuitionism espoused by Moore and especially Ross. He\nmoderates a number of elements of their intuitionism, highlights\nothers, and arguably breaks with at least Ross on one significant\npoint. We will begin with two ways in which his intuitionism softens\nelements of theirs.\n\nFirst, earlier intuitionists did not consistently distinguish between\ntwo roles for necessity or self-evidence. Moral intuition might\nconsist in apprehending that some moral proposition is necessary, or\nthat it is self-evident. Or moral intuition might consist in just\napprehending some moral proposition\u2019s truth, while the\nproposition is in fact necessary or it is in fact self-evident. As a\nresult, the earlier intuitionists often suggest our knowledge of\nfundamental moral principles is grounded in recognition of either the\nnecessity or self-evidence of these principles. This imposes too\nstrong a requirement on the a priori justification of moral\nprinciples. We cannot expect ordinary people to possess technical,\nphilosophical concepts such as necessity and self-evidence. But there\nis no need to exclude ordinary people who lack these concepts from\nhaving a priori knowledge of ordinary moral propositions,\ne.g., that pain is bad or that promising to do something provides a\nmoral reason for doing it. And even if an ordinary person does have\nthe concepts of necessity and self-evidence, there is no reason to\ndeny that the person knows ordinary moral propositions a\npriori when she or he believes them on the basis of understanding\nthem, without noting their modal status (as necessary) or epistemic\nstatus (as self-evident). Doing so is not required by the standard\naccount of self-evidence. Audi is very clear about the distinction\nbetween apprehending the necessity or self-evidence of a proposition,\nand apprehending the truth of a proposition that is necessary or\nself-evident. He does not require the former in order to have a\npriori knowledge of fundamental moral principles (2004:\n41\u201345).\n\nAudi stresses a second point, one we mentioned when discussing Ross.\nThe earlier intuitionists held that there was no reason or evidence\nfor self-evident moral principles and that they could not be\nproven. Examining why they might have made such strong claims would\ntake us too far afield. It is sufficient to note that there is no need\nfor intuitionists to make them. What\u2019s important for their\noverall position is the possibility of being non-inferentially\njustified in believing fundamental moral principles. This does not\nrequire that it is impossible to provide reasons or evidence or even a\nproof for any moral principle. Audi\u2019s intuitionism takes the\nmore moderate position that self-evident moral principles can\nbe justified without reasons, evidence or proof (2004:\n51\u201354).\n\nThere is an important element of Ross\u2019s intuitionism that Audi\ndoes not moderate, but instead makes more of than Ross. We previously\nnoted that Ross\u2019s conception of self-evidence is more restricted\nthan the standard conception in that self-evident propositions are\nevident to those who have reached sufficient mental maturity and given\nthem sufficient attention, rather than to anyone who understands them.\nThe more restricted understanding allows an explanation of why people\nwho understand a self-evident proposition might nevertheless not have\na justification for believing it. On the plausible assumption that\nthere is a close connection between what is evident for a person and\nwhat a person believes, Ross\u2019s weaker conception also suggests\nan explanation of why some people who understand a self-evident\nproposition might believe it while others do not. Audi uses different\nterminology from Ross, formulating the relevant condition on\nself-evidence in terms of \u201cadequate understanding\u201d. But\nfor Audi adequate understanding requires rather more than mere\nsemantic comprehension, and, in the end, his view is probably quite\nclose to Ross\u2019s. Audi\u2019s view of adequate understanding\nemerges when he explains how reasonable people could disagree about\nself-evident moral propositions as well as how one might continue to\nbe justified in spite of disagreement (see 2015: 67\u201372). So Audi\ndevelops and does important work with the possibilities Ross\u2019s\nmore restricted conception of self-evidence opened up, but Ross did\nnot much explore.\n\nWe now come to the point where Audi arguably breaks with much earlier\nthought regarding intuitionism. A second element of the earlier\nintuitionism that Audi emphasizes concerns the connection between\nintuition and belief. Neither Moore nor Ross made much use of\n\u201cbelief\u201d and cognate terms. One can nevertheless make a\nfairly strong case that Moore probably would not have agreed that\nintuitions are beliefs. Ross is more difficult, but there is a strong\ntemptation to interpret him as holding that intuitions are beliefs\nwhen he writes, e.g., that \u201cthe moral convictions of thoughtful\nand well-educated people are the data of ethics\u201d (1930: 41).\nMany who have written about intuitions or intuitionism follow Ross so\ninterpreted, assuming that intuitions are beliefs. Audi follows the\nlead of a number of contemporary writers on intuition (beginning with\nBealer 1998) in recognizing the significance of what Audi calls\n\u201cepisodic intuitions\u201d. Episodic intuitions are\n\u201cintellectual seemings\u2014a phenomenal, attentional sense of\nthe truth of the proposition in question\u201d (Audi 2015: 61). When\nwe have an episodic intuition, we tend to believe the proposition\nintuited. But it is significant that one can have an episodic\nintuition without believing. Bealer illustrated the point with the\nna\u00efve comprehension axiom of set theory. He reports that when he\nconsiders this axiom on its own, it seems true to him. But he does not\nbelieve the axiom, because he knows that it leads to\n paradox.[8]\n Interestingly, the intuition persists in spite of the recognition\nthat the axiom is false. Many people share Bealer\u2019s experience.\nBealer notes that his example is a purely intellectual analog of the\nM\u00fcller-Lyer illusion: In spite of knowing that the lines in the\nillusion are equally long, they continue to\nseem\u2014visually\u2014to have different lengths.\n\nIt follows that episodic intuitions are not beliefs. Some writers hold\nthat episodic intuitions are dispositions or felt dispositions to\nbelieve (see, e.g., Sosa 1998 and Williamson 2007). Others hold that\nepisodic intuitions are sui generis propositional attitudes\n(see, e.g., Bealer 1998 and Huemer 2005). Audi seems to side with\nthose who hold episodic intuitions to be sui generis\npropositional attitudes.\n\nBealer\u2019s example shows that we can have episodic intuitions of\nfalse propositions and propositions that are not self-evident. Audi\nargues that one might adequately understand a self-evident proposition\nand fail to have an episodic intuition of it using as an example the\nproposition that \u201ca child can be borne by its grandmother\u201d\n(2015: 65). He claims that this proposition is self-evident\u2014to\nfigure out why it is true, think of Oedipus Rex\u2014but denies that\nit is intuitive, noting that some people even have an episodic\nintuition of its falsehood.\n\nAudi claims that Ross and other earlier intuitionists realized that\nnot all intuitions had self-evident propositions as their objects. It\nis not obvious that they did, but we cannot pursue the issue. They\ncertainly did not make a sufficient fuss about episodic intuitions to\navoid being widely interpreted as holding that the intuitions\nresponsible for our knowledge of morality are all beliefs in\nself-evident propositions. So Audi at the very least breaks with one\ncommon understanding of the earlier intuitionist position.\n\nEpisodic intuitions are epistemically and methodologically important\nfor Audi. Here is a representative passage: \n\n\nAn episodic intuition, as an experience, does not stand in need of\njustification and may confer it. Like sense experience, it is only a\nfallible indicator of truth; but much as we cannot navigate the\nphysical world without sense experience, we cannot adequately pursue\ntruth in ethics or elsewhere without intuition. (2015: 65) \n\n\nIt is very clear that on the earlier intuitionist view, the\njustification for fundamental moral principles was a priori.\nWhat about Audi\u2019s intuitionism? Since he does allow that some\nmoral principles are self-evident, and that when a person believes\nsuch a self-evident proposition on the basis of adequate\nunderstanding, the person knows, he recognizes a place for a\npriori moral knowledge. But what about beliefs in moral\npropositions that are not self-evident, but are formed on the basis of\nepisodic intuitions? Audi holds such beliefs can be justified, but is\nthe justification a priori? As is indicated by the analogy\nwith sense experience that Audi stresses, episodic intuitions are\ndecidedly experiences. When a belief formed on the basis of an\nepisodic intuition is justified, its justification depends upon the\nexperience and hence is not independent of experience except for the\nexperience necessary to acquire the relevant concepts. One can regard\nsuch beliefs as justified a priori only if one adopts the\nmodified standard view of the a priori, which holds a\npriori knowledge and justification to be independent of\nperceptual, introspective, memorial and all other\nexperiences\u2014except for the experience of rational\nintuition. (For a more recent treatment of these issues, see Audi\n2020.)\n\nIn closing, it is interesting to note that the version of contemporary\nintuitionism defended by Huemer (2005) also pushes one towards the\nmodified standard view. The epistemological side of Huemer\u2019s\nethical intuitionism is a natural outgrowth of his general\nepistemological position, which he calls phenomenological\nconservativism. According to phenomenal conservativism, if it seems to\none that a proposition is true, then one is prima facie\njustified in believing that proposition. Significantly, the specific\nkind of seeming\u2014perceptual, from memory, by reasoning, or\notherwise\u2014is irrelevant to the seeming\u2019s capacity to\njustify. Huemer\u2019s phenomenological conservativism holds that all\nour beliefs are based on how things seem, and hence that unless\nseeming true justifies us in believing, we could not be justified in\nbelieving anything. Phenomenal conservativism drives one to the\nmodified standard view of the a priori because the\nintellectual seeming is what justifies. One might be concerned that\nthe modified standard view understands the distinction between\nrational intuition and all other kinds of seemings to be very\nsignificant epistemically\u2014it is what marks the crucial\ndistinction between the a priori and the empirical\u2014but\nfor phenomenological conservativism it is all just seemings, with no\nkind of seeming playing any different epistemological role from any\nother kind of seeming. One might allay the concern by noting that the\nmodified standard view already admitted a role for experience in a\npriori justification, but distinguished the experience of\nrational intuition or intellectual seeming from all other kinds of\nexperience. Nevertheless, when considering contemporary versions of\nmoral intuitionism, especially when combined with phenomenological\nconservativism, it is hard not to notice that, if intuitive moral\nknowledge as these views conceive it is a priori, then the\noperative conception of the a priori has strayed a\nconsiderable distance from the old root idea of independence from\nexperience.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Audi, Robert, 2004, <em>The Good in the Right</em>, Princeton:\nPrinceton University Press.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2015, \u201cIntuition and Its Place in\nEthics\u201d, <em>Journal of the American Philosophical\nAssociation</em>, 1: 57\u201377.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2020, \u201cToward an Epistemology of\nMoral Principles\u201d, <em>Res Philosophica</em>, 97(1):\n69\u201392.", "Ayer, A.J., 1936, <em>Language, Truth and Logic</em>, London:\nVictor Gollancz, LTD.", "Bealer, George, 1998, \u201cIntuition and the Autonomy of\nPhilosophy\u201d, in DePaul and Ramsey 1998: 201\u2013239.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2000, \u201cA Theory of the A\nPriori\u201d, <em>Pacific Philosophical Quarterly</em>, 81:\n1\u201330.", "Bengson, John, Terence Cuneo, and Russ Shafer-Landau, 2020,\n\u201cTrusting Moral Intuitions,\u201d <em>No\u00fbs</em>, 54(4):\n956\u2013984.", "Berker, Selim, 2019, \u201cMackie Was Not an Error\nTheorist\u201d, <em>Philosophical Perspectives</em>, 33:\n5\u201325.", "Blackburn, Simon, 1993, <em>Essays in Quasi-Realism</em>, New\nYork: Oxford University Press.", "Boghossian, Paul and Christopher Peacoke (eds.), 2000, <em>New\nEssays on the A Priori</em>, Oxford: Clarendon Press.", "Boyd, Richard, 1988, \u201cHow to Be a Moral Realist\u201d, in\n<em>Essays on Moral Realism</em>, G.
