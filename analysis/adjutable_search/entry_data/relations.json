    "preamble": "\n\nThe world we inhabit isn\u2019t an undifferentiated bog. Everywhere\nthere\u2019s repetition and, importantly, we can even distinguish\ndifferent types of repetition. We see one cat and then\nanother cat. But we can also see that our cat is on top\nof the mat and subsequently notice that the cat from next door is\non top of the fence. Repetition in the first sense requires\nonly one thing and then another. By contrast, repetition in the second\nsense requires two (or more) things and then two (or more) other\nthings. Properties are typically introduced to account for repetition\nin the first sense, whereas relations are typically introduced to\naccount for repetition in the second sense. There\u2019s cat\nrepetition because there is more than one thing that has a certain\nproperty, the property of being a cat. There\u2019s above-and-below\nrepetition because there is more than one thing that bears a certain\nrelation to something else, the relation that holds between two things\nwhen one is on top of the other.\n\nIt\u2019s doubtful whether the distinction between properties and\nrelations can be given in terms that do not ultimately presuppose\nit\u2014the distinction is so basic. Nevertheless, there are\nelucidations on offer that may help us better appreciate the\ndistinction. Properties merely hold of the things that have\nthem, whereas relations aren\u2019t relations of anything,\nbut hold between things, or, alternatively, relations are\nborne by one thing to other things, or, another\nalternative paraphrase, relations have a subject of inherence\nwhose relations they are and termini to which they\nrelate the subject. More examples may help too. When we say that a\nthing \\(A\\) is black, or \\(A\\) is long, then we are asserting that\nthere is some property \\(A\\) has. But when we say that \\(A\\) is\n(wholly) inside \\(B\\) then we are asserting that there is a relation\nin which \\(A\\) stands to \\(B\\).\n\nBe careful though not to be misled by these examples. \\(A\\) can only\nbe (wholly) inside \\(B\\) if \\(A\\) is distinct from \\(B\\). So the\nrelation in which \\(A\\) stands to \\(B\\) if \\(A\\) is (wholly) inside\n\\(B\\) requires a distinct subject from terminus. By contrast, \\(A\\)\ncan be black without prejudice to anything else. But we cannot infer\nstraightaway that every relation holds between more than one thing\nbecause there may be some relations that a thing bears to itself, if,\nfor example, identity is a relation. So we cannot distinguish\nproperties from relations by appealing to the number of distinct\nthings required for their exhibition, since these may be the same,\nviz. one. Hence the plausibility of thinking that a relation differs\nfrom a property because a relation, unlike a property, proceeds\nfrom a subject to a terminus, even if the subject\nand terminus are identical.\n\nTheories of relations add to, subtract from or qualify this basic\npackage of ideas in various ways. But with the distinction between\nproperties and relations in hand we can already do some worthwhile\nconceptual geography, distinguishing four regions of logical space.\n(1) Rejection of both properties and relations. (2) Acceptance of\nproperties but rejection of relations. (3) Acceptance of relations but\nrejection of properties. (4) Acceptance of both properties and\nrelations. (1) amounts to a form of thoroughgoing nominalism and is\ntypically motivated by a blanket aversion to the doctrine that general\nwords like \u201cblack\u201d or \u201cbefore\u201d refer to\nworldly items, whether properties or relations. By contrast, (2), (3)\nand (4) amount to different forms of realism, whether about properties\nand/or relations. Typically they are motivated either by an especial\nantipathy toward relations (2) or, alternatively, an appreciation of\ntheir distinctive utility ((3) and (4)). Here we will focus upon what\nit is about relations in particular that makes philosophers either\nlove them or hate them.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Preliminary Distinctions\n\nTo understand the contemporary debate about relations we will need to\nhave some logical and philosophical distinctions in place. These\ndistinctions aren\u2019t to be taken for granted. Part of the\ndevelopment of the debate has consisted in the refinement of precisely\nthese distinctions. But you need to understand how, relatively\nspeaking, things got started.\n\nTo begin let\u2019s distinguish between the \u201cdegree\u201d or\n\u201cadicity\u201d or \u201carity\u201d of relations (see, e.g.,\nArmstrong 1978b: 75). Properties are \u201cone-place\u201d or\n\u201cmonadic\u201d or \u201cunary\u201d because properties are\nonly exhibited by particulars or other items, e.g., properties,\nindividually or one by one. Relations are \u201cmany-place\u201d or\n\u201c\\(n\\)-adic\u201d or \u201c\\(n\\)-ary\u201d (where \\(n\\gt 1)\\)\nbecause they are exhibited by particulars only in relation to other\nparticulars. A \u201c2-place\u201d or \u201cdyadic\u201d or\n\u201cbinary\u201d relation is exhibited by one particular only in\nrelation to another. A \u201c3-place\u201d or \u201ctriadic\u201d\nor \u201cternary\u201d relation is exhibited by one particular only\nin relation to exactly two others. And so on. Some examples. The\nrelation that \\(x\\) stands to \\(y\\) whenever \\(x\\) is\nadjacent to \\(y\\) is binary. This is because it takes two\nthings to be adjacent to one another. The relation that \\(x\\) stands\nto \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) whenever \\(x\\) is between \\(y\\) and \\(z\\)\nis ternary because it takes three things for one to fall between the\nother two.\n\nIn these terms, a relation can be distinguished from a\n\u201crelational property\u201d. Whereas a relation is borne by one\nthing to another thing (possibly, in certain cases, to the same\nthing), a relational property is the property of bearing a relation to\nsomething. Suppose \\(a\\) bears a relation \\(R\\) to \\(b\\). Then \\(a\\)\nhas the relational property of bearing \\(R\\) to \\(b\\) whilst \\(b\\) has\nthe property of \\(a\\)\u2019s bearing \\(R\\) to it. Here \\(R\\) is\nbinary whilst the relational properties are unary because they are had\nby single things, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) respectively. For example, marriage\nis a relation between two people but being married to Cleopatra is a\nrelational property had by Antony whilst being married to Antony is a\nrelational property had by Cleopatra.\n\nA \u201cunigrade\u201d relation \\(R\\) is a relation that has a\ndefinite degree or adicity: \\(R\\) is either binary or ternary\u2026\nor \\(n\\)-ary (for some unique \\(n\\)). By contrast a relation is\n\u201cmultigrade\u201d if it fails to be unigrade (the expression is\nowed to Leonard & Goodman 1940: 50). Putative examples include\ncausal, biological, physical, geometrical, intentional and logical\nrelations. Causation appears to be multigrade because a certain number\nof events may be required to bring about an effect on one occasion,\nand a different number of events may be required to bring about an\neffect on another. Similarly, entailment appears to be a multigrade\nrelation because a certain number of premises may be required to\nentail one conclusion but a different number of premises to entail\nanother. Whether there are any multigrade relations and exactly what\nit means to be multigrade is a fraught matter (see Armstrong 1978b:\n93\u20134, 1997: 85, 2010: 23\u20135 and Dixon 2019: 64\u20137 for\narguments against multigrade relations and Morton 1975, Fine 2000: 22,\nMacBride 2005: 569\u201393 and Hossack 2007: 45\u201355 for\narguments in favour of them).\n\nNext, let\u2019s draw a preliminary three-fold distinction between\nbinary relations in terms of their behaviour with respect to the\nthings they relate. A binary relation \\(R\\) is symmetric iff\nwhenever \\(x\\) bears \\(R\\) to \\(y\\), \\(y\\) bears \\(R\\) to \\(x\\). By\ncontrast, \\(R\\) is non-symmetric iff \\(R\\) fails to be\nsymmetric. Asymmetric relations are a special case of\nnon-symmetric ones: R is asymmetric iff whenever \\(x\\) bears \\(R\\) to\n\\(y\\) then \\(y\\) does not bear \\(R\\) to \\(x\\). So whilst all\nasymmetric relations are non-symmetric, not all non-symmetric\nrelations are asymmetric. Some examples. Whenever \\(x\\) is married to\n\\(y\\), \\(y\\) is married to \\(x\\). So the relation in which \\(x\\)\nstands to \\(y\\) when \\(x\\) is married to \\(y\\) is a symmetric\nrelation. But if \\(x\\) loves \\(y\\), it isn\u2019t guaranteed that\n\\(y\\) loves \\(x\\). Because, alas, sometimes love is unrequited. So the\nrelation in which \\(x\\) stands to \\(y\\) when \\(x\\) loves \\(y\\) is a\nnon-symmetric relation. But love doesn\u2019t have to go unrequited\notherwise far fewer people would get married, only cynics and gold\ndiggers. So this relation isn\u2019t asymmetric. By contrast, the\nrelation in which \\(x\\) stands to \\(y\\) when \\(x\\) is taller than\n\\(y\\) is asymmetric because if \\(x\\) is taller than \\(y\\) then \\(y\\)\nisn\u2019t taller than \\(x\\). This doesn\u2019t exhaust the logical\nclassification of relations. It\u2019s easy to see that further\ndistinctions will need be drawn. Consider, for example, the\nbetween relation. It\u2019s a ternary relation that is\nsymmetric in the sense that if \\(x\\) is between \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) then\n\\(x\\) is between \\(z\\) and \\(y\\). But the between relation\nisn\u2019t completely or strictly symmetric because\nit\u2019s not the case that if \\(x\\) is between \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) then\n\\(y\\) is between \\(x\\) and \\(z\\). So the distinction between symmetric\nand non-symmetric relations for \\(n\\)-ary relations, where \\(n \\gt\n2\\), will need to be qualified. (In what follows we restrict ourselves\nto the more straightforward cases discussed in the philosophical\nliterature on relations. But see Russell 1919: 41\u201352 for a more\nwide-ranging discussion of the logical variety of relations.)\n\nNevertheless, equipped with this three-fold distinction for binary\ndistinction we can now appreciate the significance of one contemporary\ndebate about relations. Our ordinary and scientific views of the world\nare replete with descriptions of things that are non-symmetrically or\nasymmetrically related. For this reason, Russell advocating admitting\nboth non-symmetric and asymmetric relations alongside symmetric ones\n(Russell 1903: \u00a7\u00a7212\u20136, 1914: 58\u20139, 1924: 339).\nBut, more recently, it has been questioned whether it is necessary to\nadmit non-symmetric and asymmetric relations at all, i.e., it has been\nargued that the world contains only symmetric relations by Armstrong\n1997: 143\u20134; Dorr 2004: 180\u20137; Simons 2010: 207\u20131,\nbut for counter-arguments see MacBride 2015: 178\u201394.\n\nNow non-symmetric relations, including asymmetric ones, are typically\ndescribed as imposing an order upon the things they relate; they admit\nof what is also called differential application (Fine 2000:\n8). This means that for any such non-symmetric \\(R\\) there are\nmultiple different ways in which \\(R\\) potentially applies to the\nthings it relates. Why? If the way that loves applies to\n\\(a\\) and \\(b\\) when \\(a\\) loves \\(b\\) were no different from the way\nthat loves applies to them when \\(b\\) loves \\(a\\), then the\nloves relation couldn\u2019t be non-symmetric, because\notherwise \\(a\\) couldn\u2019t love \\(b\\) without \\(b\\)\u2019s loving\n\\(a\\). So we have to distinguish between the two different ways that\nloves is capable of applying to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Similarly we\ncan distinguish the six different ways that the ternary\nbetween relation potentially applies to three things. By\ncontrast, we\u2019re not required by the same reasoning to\ndistinguish between the different ways in which a (strictly) symmetric\nrelation applies to the things it relates. There\u2019s no\ncorresponding necessity to distinguish the way that the\nadjacency relation applies to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) when \\(a\\) is\nadjacent to \\(b\\) from the way that the adjacency relation applies to\nthem when \\(b\\) is adjacent to \\(a\\) because \\(a\\) cannot be adjacent\nto \\(b\\) without \\(b\\) being adjacent to \\(a\\).\n\nPutting the ideas of the last three paragraphs together, philosophers\noften seek to capture what is distinctive about relations by\ndescribing them in the following manner. Unlike properties, binary\nrelations aren\u2019t exhibited by particulars but by pairs\nof particulars. Similarly ternary universals aren\u2019t exhibited by\nparticulars but by triples of particulars, etc. But, we have\nseen, non-symmetric relations, including asymmetrical ones, are\norder-sensitive. So the pairs, triples, etc., of objects that exhibit\nthese relations must be themselves ordered. It is only ordered pairs,\nordered triples, more generally, \\(n\\)-tuples or sequences that\nexhibit relations (Kim 1973: 222; Chisholm 1996: 53; Loux 1998:\n23).\n\nThere are a number of reasons we should be wary of characterising\nrelations in such quasi-mathematical terms. First, sequences\npresuppose order, the difference between a thing\u2019s coming first\nand thing\u2019s coming second, so cannot be used to explain order\nwithout our going around in a tight circle. Second, it\u2019s\nproblematic to try to explain a relation between two things in terms\nof another thing, a sequence, which is those two things put together\nin an order (MacBride 2005: 590\u20132). If a sequence \\(s\\)\n(\\(=\\langle x, y \\rangle\\)) is conceived as a \u201cone\u201d such\nthat a relation \\(R\\) is really only a monadic feature of it,\n\\(R(s)\\), then it\u2019s mysterious what \\(R\\)\u2019s holding of\n\\(s\\) has to do with \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) being arranged one way rather\nthan another with respect to \\(R\\). If you don\u2019t see the mystery\nstraightaway, reflect that \\(s\\) may have a monadic feature \\(F\\),\nwhich is, so to speak, only to do with \\(s\\) itself rather than its\nmembers. But if \\(R\\) and \\(F\\) are conceived alike, as monadic\nfeatures of \\(s\\), isn\u2019t it mysterious that the possession by\n\\(s\\) of \\(R\\) has consequences for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) whereas \\(F\\)\ndoesn\u2019t? If, alternatively, a sequence is conceived as a\n\u201cmany\u201d, just \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), such that \\(R\\) applies to\nthem directly, then it\u2019s unclear what the appeal to sequences\nhas achieved.\n\nWe cannot avoid the difficulties associated with sequences by\nappealing to the Kuratowski definition of sequences in terms of\nunordered sets (where, e.g., \\(\\langle x, y\\rangle = \\{\\{x\\}, \\{x,\ny\\}\\}\\)) (or Bergmann\u2019s Kuratowski inspired account of order in\nterms of \u2018diads\u2019, see his 1981: 147). There are\nindefinitely many other set-theoretic constructions upon which we may\nrely to model sequences, e.g., Wiener\u2019s, hence the familiar\nobjection that we cannot legitimately fix upon any one such\nconstruction as revelatory of the nature of sequences (see Kitcher\n(1978: 125\u20136) generalising upon a point originally made by\nBenacerraf (1965: 54\u201362)). But there is also the less familiar\nobjection that the Kuratowski definition cannot be used to analyse the\norder inherent in the sequence \\(\\langle x, y\\rangle\\). Compare: we\ncannot analyse personal identity in terms of memory because it\u2019s\nbuilt into the what we mean by memory that you can only remember\nyour own experiences, i.e., the very notion that we set out\nto explain, viz. personal identity, is presupposed by our analysans.\nSimilarly \\(\\{\\{x\\}, \\{x, y\\}\\}\\) only serves as a model of \\(\\langle\nx, y\\rangle\\) relative to the assumption that the thing that belongs\nto a singleton member, namely \\(\\{x\\}\\), of the first class comes\nfirst in the pair \\(\\langle x, y\\rangle\\), so the notion of order\nis presupposed (Hochberg 1981, 2001: 176\u20137).\n\nThe next idea that needs to be introduced is the idea of a\nconverse relation. For any given binary relation \\(R\\), the\nconverse of \\(R\\) may be defined as the relation \\(R^*\\) that \\(x\\)\nbears to \\(y\\) whenever \\(y\\) bears \\(R\\) to \\(x\\) (Fine 2000: 3; van\nInwagen 2006: 459). Note that the relationship between a relation and\nits converse isn\u2019t a matter of happenstance; there\u2019s no\npossibility of a converse of \\(R\\) floating free from \\(R\\) and\nholding between things independently of how \\(R\\) arranges them.\nRather it\u2019s a more intimate relationship which, if it holds,\nholds of necessity. For \\(x\\) to have one to \\(y\\) is, so to speak,\nfor \\(y\\) to have the other to \\(x\\); they neither exist nor can be\nobserved apart from one another but can only be distinguished in\nthought (Geach 1957: 33). Before and after,\nabove and below are prima facie examples of\nmutually converse relations. Non-symmetric relations, including\nasymmetric ones, are distinct from their converses (if they have\nthem). Suppose \\(R\\) is a non-symmetric relation which \\(x\\) bears to\n\\(y.\\) Then the converse of \\(R\\) is borne by \\(y\\) to \\(x\\). But\nsuppose that \\(R\\), as it may, fails to be borne by \\(y\\) to \\(x\\).\nThen something is true of the converse of \\(R\\) that isn\u2019t true\nof \\(R\\) itself, viz. that it is borne by \\(y\\) to \\(x\\).\nHence, the converse of \\(R\\) must be distinct from \\(R\\). More\ngenerally, whilst a binary non-symmetric relation has only one\nconverse, a ternary one has five mutual, distinct converses, a\nquadratic relation has 23 converses, etc. The issue of whether\nrelations have converses is another issue to which we will return\nlater.\n\nThe next distinction we will need, or more accurately, family of\ndistinctions, is between internal and external relations.\nWhat makes them members of a single family is that a relation is\ninternal if its holding between things is somehow fixed by the things\nthemselves or how those things are; external relations are relations\nwhose holding between things isn\u2019t fixed this way. Different\nversions of the internal-external distinction correspond to different\nexplanations of how internal relations are fixed (Ewing 1934:\n118\u201336; Dunn 1990: 188\u2013192; Hakkarainen, Kein\u00e4nen\n& Keskinen, 2019). We don\u2019t need to describe every version\nof the distinction but here are three that are essential to\nunderstanding the contemporary debate.\n\nThe first version of the distinction is owed to Moore. According to\nMoore\u2019s (1919: 47), a binary relation \\(R\\) is internal iff if\n\\(x\\) bears \\(R\\) to \\(y\\) then \\(x\\) does so necessarily. From the\ninternality of \\(R\\), in Moore\u2019s sense, it follows that if \\(x\\)\nexists at all then \\(x\\) indeed bears \\(R\\) to \\(y\\). But if\nit\u2019s possible that \\(x\\) exist whilst failing to bear \\(R\\) to\n\\(y\\), then \\(R\\) is external. The doctrine of the necessity of origin\nprovides one putative example of a relation that\u2019s internal in\nMoore\u2019s sense. If you essentially come from your biological\nparents then you could not have existed whilst failing to be their\noffspring, i.e., the relation of biologically originating\nfrom must be internal in Moore\u2019s sense.\n\nThe second version of the internal-external distinction is favoured by\nArmstrong (1978b: 84\u20135, 1989: 43, 1997: 87\u20139, van Inwagen\n1993: 33\u20134). According to Armstrong, a relation \\(R\\) is\ninternal iff it\u2019s holding between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is\nnecessitated by the intrinsic natures, i.e., non-relational\nproperties, of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\); otherwise \\(R\\) is external. The third\nversion is owed to Lewis. Lewis (1986: 62) advanced the view that an\ninternal relation is one that supervenes upon the intrinsic natures of\nits relata. But Lewis\u2019s definition of \u201cexternal\u201d is\nmore involved: \\(R\\) is external iff (1) it fails to supervene upon\nthe nature of the relata taken separately, but (2) it does supervene\non the nature of the composite of the relata taken together.\n\nSuppose that \\(x\\) is a cube and \\(y\\) is also a cube. It follows that\n\\(x\\) is the same shape as \\(y.\\) So the relation that \\(x\\) bears to\n\\(y\\) when \\(x\\) is the same shape as \\(y\\) is internal in\nArmstrong\u2019s sense. By contrast, spatio-temporal relations are\nexternal (in his sense) because the intrinsic characteristics of \\(x\\)\nand \\(y\\) don\u2019t necessitate how close or far apart \\(x\\) and\n\\(y\\) are. Lewis intends his distinction to classify the same way. If\n\\(x\\) is the same shape as \\(y\\), but \\(w\\) is not the same shape as\nz, then there must be some difference in intrinsic nature either\nbetween \\(x\\) and \\(w\\) or else between \\(y\\) and \\(z\\). So the\nrelation that \\(x\\) bears to \\(y\\) when \\(x\\) is the same shape as\n\\(y\\) is internal in Lewis\u2019s sense. Lewis also claims that the\ndistance between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is an external relation because the\nfollowing conditions are met: (1) \\(x\\) may be closer to \\(y\\) than\n\\(w\\) is to \\(z\\) even though \\(x\\) is an intrinsic duplicate of\n\\(w\\), i.e., shares all and only the same intrinsic characteristics,\nand \\(y\\) an intrinsic duplicate of \\(z\\); (2) the distance between\n\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) does supervene upon the nature of the composite\n\\(x+y\\). (We\u2019ll return in\n section 3\n to the question whether, as Lewis claims, distance relation supervene\nupon the nature of composites.) But the relation that \\(x\\) bears to\n\\(y\\) when \\(x\\) is the same shape as \\(y\\) isn\u2019t internal in\nMoore\u2019s sense because, let us suppose, \\(x\\) might have been\nspherical whilst \\(y\\) remained a cube; so it doesn\u2019t follow\nfrom the mere fact that \\(x\\) exists that \\(x\\) is the same shape as\n\\(y\\).\n\nThe final distinction, or rather, collection of distinctions, which\nwe\u2019ll introduce here and which needs to be borne in mind when\nconsidering the recent debate on relations, concerns the existence and\nidentity conditions for relations. Since Lewis it has become\ncommonplace to conceive relations as either \u201cabundant\u201d or\n\u201csparse\u201d: according to an abundant conception there is a\nrelation for every arbitrary pair (or triple, or ...) of things\nwhereas according to a sparse conception there are only as many\nrelations as are required to characterise the relational aspects of\nlikeness and difference (Lewis 1986: 61). But this binary distinction\ndoesn\u2019t do justice to the variety of different conceptions of\nthe existence and identity of relations that have been put forward.\nDistinguish, on the one hand, an a posterori view according\nto which relations exist only if they are instantiated and whether\nthey are instantiated is an empirical matter (Armstrong 1978a:\n76\u201377) from, on the other hand, an a priori view\naccording to which their existence is settled by purely logical\nprinciples, for example strong comprehension principles whereby every\nopen formula determines a corresponding property or relation (Zalta\n1988: 46\u20137; Williamson 2013: 226\u20137). Whereas the former\nview might admit space-time separation as a relation (or family of\nrelations) whose instantiation is confirmed by physics, the latter\nwould affirm the existence of a relation corresponding to the open\nformula \u201cx is a much funnier anarchist than\ny\u201d. Between these two extremes are views that allow\nsome relations, for example, relative velocities conceived as\nrelations between different things when one has a certain velocity\nrelative to another, to be uninstantiated for the purposes of\nrounding out scientific theory (Bigelow and Pargetter 1990: 77) and\nviews that allow logically complex relations (RvS, R&S\netc.) insofar as they are built up by logical operations from\nsimple relations (R, S etc.) found in nature (Bealer 1982:\n9\u201310).\n\nThere is a considerable variety of views concerning the identity\nconditions for relations. Distinguish, for example, a\n\u201ccoarse-grained\u201d conception, according to which relations\nare identical just in case they are necessarily equivalent,\ni.e. identical just in case, as a matter of necessity, they\nare exhibited by the same pairs, triples... of things, from a\n\u201cfine-grained\u201d conception, according to which relations\nare identical just in case they have the same analysis in terms of\nsimpler relations (Bealer 1982: 2\u20133, Menzel 1993: 62\u20134).\nAnother approach conceives relations as the same just in case they\nconfer the same causal powers on the pairs, triples... of things\nrelated by them. A further approach to relation identity says that,\nfor example, the dyadic relations R and S are\nidentical if their corresponding relational properties (bearing\nR to a, bearing S to a\netc.) are identical, where properties in general (which,\nrecall, are unary) are identical just in case, according to this view,\nthey are \u201cencodings\u201d of the same \u201cabstract\nobject\u201d. The sense of abstract object here is a specialised one:\nroughly speaking, an abstract object encodes a property by\nencapsulating what it is to exhibit the property in question (Zalta\n1988: 51\u201352). Even though these different conceptions of the\nexistence and identity conditions for relations yield different\nresults in different cases it is important to also bear in mind that\nthey need not invariably be seen as competing. It may be that they\nprovide different notions of relation relevant to different purposes,\nfor example, whether we are interested in relations because of their\nrole in causation, semantics, intentionality and so on (Lewis 1986:\n55\u201359).\n2. Eliminativism, External Relations and Bradley\u2019s Regress\n\nSome philosophers are wary of admitting relations because they are\ndifficult to locate. Glasgow is west of Edinburgh. This tells us\nsomething about the locations of these two cities. But where is the\nrelation that holds between them in virtue of which Glasgow is west of\nEdinburgh? The relation can\u2019t be in one city at the expense of\nthe other, nor in each of them taken separately, since then we lose\nsight of the fact that the relation holds between them\n(McTaggart 1920: \u00a780). Rather the relation must somehow share the\ndivided locations of Glasgow and Edinburgh without itself being\ndivided. This may sound peculiar if we assume that middle-sized things\nlike cities, which have locations in a relatively straightforward\nsense, set a standard for how entities in general ought to behave. But\nwhy shouldn\u2019t we admit other kinds of entity that have a\ndifferent kind of relationship to space and time from such readily\nlocated things. Or even go down the route of conceiving relations as\nabstract, i.e., as \u201cNowhere and nowhen\u201d (Russell 1912:\n55\u20136). As Lewis reflected, \u201cif the price is right, we\ncould learn to tolerate it\u201d (Lewis 1986: 68). But is the price\nright? Do the theoretical benefits of admitting relations outweigh the\ncost of offending pre-theoretic intuition?\n\nOther philosophers have been wary of admitting relations because, they\ncomplain, relations are unsatisfactorily characterised, \u201cneither\nfish nor fowl\u201d, i.e., neither substances nor attributes (Heil\n2012: 141, 2016: 130) or \"ontologically weird\" (Lowe 2016:\n111). Now it\u2019s certainly true that \\(n\\)-adic relations, where\n\\(n\\gt 1\\), cannot be characterised as either substances or (monadic)\nattributes. But it only follows that relations are unsatisfactorily\ncharacterised if we assume that substances and attributes provide the\nbenchmark for satisfactory characterisation. But we shouldn\u2019t\nassume this ahead of investigating whether the theoretical benefits of\nadmitting relations outweigh the costs. It\u2019s also been\ncomplained that relations are suspect because they depend\nupon the existence of substances that bear them (Campbell 1990:\n108\u20139) or, as Lowe makes the point, \u201cA \u2018relational\naccident\u2019, if there could be such a thing would not be\n\u2018in\u2019, to at least not be wholly \u2018in\u2019, any of\nits two or more \u2018subjects\u2019, nor even wholly\n\u2018in\u2019 the totality of them. I consequently find it hard to\nconceive what such an entity could really be\u201d (Lowe 2016:\n111\u20132). Of course it\u2019s true that in order for a relation\nto be borne by one thing to another thing, then those things must\nexist. But it doesn\u2019t follow that relations don\u2019t exist if\nnothing bears them. Moreover, it doesn\u2019t follow straightaway\nfrom the reflection that to be borne by something a relation needs\nthings to bear it, that relations are suspect. It doesn\u2019t follow\nany more than it follows from the reflection that to be had by\nsomething an attribute needs things to have it, that attributes are\nsuspect. If the price is right we should open our minds to the\npossibility of things which are neither fish nor fowl but vegetables,\ni.e., neither substances nor attributes but relations.\n\nIn light of the internal/external distinction introduced above, we can\ndistinguish two distinct questions here: (a) should we acknowledge\nexternal relations? (b) should we acknowledge internal relations? In\nthe present section our focus will be upon whether to accept or reject\nexternal relations, before turning to internal relations in the\nnext.\n\nF.H. Bradley regarded himself the nemesis of external relations, but\nnot only them. Famously, Bradley brought a vicious regress argument\nagainst external relations. In his original version (1893:\n32\u20133), Bradley presented a dilemma to show that external\nrelations are unintelligible. Here\u2019s the dilemma. Either a\nrelation \\(R\\) is nothing to the things \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) it\nrelates, in which case it cannot relate them. Or, it is\nsomething to them, in which case \\(R\\) must be related to\nthem. But for \\(R\\) to be related to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) there must be not\nonly \\(R\\) and the things it relates, but also a subsidiary relation\n\\(R'\\) to relate \\(R\\) to them. But now the same problem arises with\nregard to \\(R'\\). It must be something to \\(R\\) and the things it\nrelated in order for \\(R'\\) to relate \\(R\\) to them and this requires\na further subsidiary relation \\(R''\\) between \\(R'\\), \\(R\\), \\(a\\) and\n\\(b\\). But positing more relations to fix up the problem is only\nthrowing good money after bad. We fall into an infinite regress\nbecause the same reasoning applies equally to \\(R'\\) and however many\nother subsidiary relations we subsequently introduce\u2014this is\ncommonly called \u201cBradley\u201ds Regress\u2019. As Bradley\nlater summed up,\n\n\n\u201cwhile we keep to our terms and relation as external, no\nintroduction of a third factor could help us to anything better than\nan endless renewal of our failure\u201d (Bradley 1935: 643; van\nInwagen 1993: 35\u20136).\n\n\nSo whichever horn of Bradley\u2019s dilemma we choose, whether a\nrelation \\(R\\) is nothing or something to the things it relates, we\ncannot make sense of \\(R\\) relating them. Bradley concluded that we\nshould eliminate external relations from our ontology.\n\nIt is often claimed that Bradley\u2019s eliminativism may be\naddressed by positing a special category of entities, either (1) facts\n(Hochberg 1978: 338\u201340; Armstrong 1989: 109\u2013110, 1997:\n118\u20139; Hossack 2007: 41\u20135) or (2) tropes (Maurin 2010:\n321\u20133; Simons 2010: 201\u20133). The strategic idea they share\nis that we can embrace the second horn of Bradley\u2019s dilemma\nwithout being stymied by his regress argument. Bradley assumed\nexternal relations to be general entities, i.e., universals,\ncapable of relating different things from whatever things they happen\nto actually relate. It follows from this assumption that the mere\nexistence of \\(R\\) and the things it relates cannot suffice for \\(R\\)\nto relate them, because \\(R\\) might have been engaged elsewhere\nrelating other things, and this problem will persist however many\nsubsidiary (universal) \\(R\\)s we introduce. But, it is argued, this\nproblem can be avoided by either positing facts or tropes, which are\nparticular rather than general entities. Both of these purported\nsolutions are open to question. It seems that they presuppose what\nthey set out to show: the capacity of relations to relate (MacBride\n2011: 168\u201372). Why is this?\n\nFirst, take (1): Hochberg, Armstrong and Hossack argue that the fact\nthat \\(a\\Rel b\\) does indeed suffice for \\(R\\) to hold between \\(a\\)\nand \\(b\\), because the fact that \\(a\\Rel b\\) cannot exist unless \\(R\\)\ndoes hold between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So once the fact that \\(a\\Rel b\\)\nhas been admitted into our ontology, the later stages of\nBradley\u2019s regress either don\u2019t arise or they harmlessly\nsupervene upon the admission of this fact. But, MacBride counters,\nthis presupposes that Bradley\u2019s argument has already been\ndisarmed. Ask yourself: what is a fact? What distinguishes the fact\nthat \\(a\\Rel b\\) from the mere plurality of its constituents: \\(R\\),\n\\(a\\), \\(b\\)? Just this: that the constituents of the fact are\nrelated. But Bradley\u2019s argument is intended to\nestablish that we cannot understand how it is possible for things to\nbe related. So unless we have already established where\nBradley\u2019s argument goes wrong, we cannot appeal to the existence\nof facts because facts are cast into doubt by his argument too.\n\nNext, take (2). Maurin and Simons argue that if we reject\nBradley\u2019s assumption that relations are general entities, i.e.\nuniversals, and hold instead that relations are a special class of\nparticular entities, i.e., non-transferable tropes, then we can avoid\nBradley\u2019s Regress. What is a relation conceived as a\n\u201cnon-transferable trope\u201d? It\u2019s a relation \\(r_1\\)\nthat\u2019s borne essentially by the things it relates and which\ncould not have been borne by anything else (Simons 2002/3: 6). Suppose\n\\(r_1\\) is borne by \\(a\\) to \\(b\\). Then \\(r_1\\) is a trope in the\nsense that it is non-repeatable and so is not a \u201cone-over\nmany\u201d, not a universal. And \\(r_1\\) is non-transferable in the\nsense that it could not be transferred from one pair of particulars to\nanother, i.e., \\(r_1\\) could not be borne by \\(c\\) to \\(d\\) where \\(c\n\\ne a\\) and \\(d \\ne b\\). So, necessarily, if \\(r_1\\) exists then (i)\n\\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exist and (ii) \\(a\\mathbin{r_1} b\\). So in virtue of\nthe manner in which \\(r_1\\) depends upon the things it relates it\nfollows that the mere existence of \\(r_1\\) accounts for \\(a\\) and\n\\(b\\)\u2019s being related without having to go down the route of\nappealing to subsidiary relations to glue them together. But again,\nthis proposal assumes that relations really do relate, and therefore\nthat Bradley\u2019s regress has already been disarmed. By way of\nanalogy, consider the Problem of Evil: the difficulty of theoretically\nsquaring God\u2019s omnipotence, omniscience, omnibenevolence, etc.,\nwith the (apparent) fact of unnecessary evil in the world. Of course\nif God exists then there cannot be any unnecessary evil, i.e., there\nmust be a solution to the Problem of Evil. But we don\u2019t provide\na theoretical solution to the Problem by simply positing God. That\ndoesn\u2019t make any easier the theoretical task of squaring what\nappears to be unnecessary evil with the nature of an omnipotent,\nomniscient, omnibenevolent deity. Similarly we don\u2019t provide an\neffective theoretical response to Bradley\u2019s argument by simply\npositing relational tropes. Positing them doesn\u2019t provide an\nexplanation of how a relation can succeed in relating some things\nwithout requiring to be related by a further relation to them.\n\nBradley\u2019s problem with relations would be resolved if we could\nachieve a perspective whereby we appreciated that the bearing of a\nrelation isn\u2019t itself a relation or require a further relation,\nwhatever grammar may suggest (Armstrong 1978a: 106\u2013111; Grossman\n1983: 167\u20138; Lewis 2002: 6\u20137). But we won\u2019t achieve\nthat perspective until we can provide a diagnosis of Bradley\u2019s\nreasoning that relieves us of the temptation to think that the bearing\nof a relation is itself a relation.\n\nBertrand Russell dismissed Bradley\u2019s argument on the grounds\nthat philosophers who disbelieve in the reality of external relations\ncannot possibly interpret those numerous parts of sciences which\nappear to be committed to external relations (Russell 1924: 339).\nRussell\u2019s argument bears comparison to Quine\u2019s famous\nindispensability argument for mathematics: just as we cannot make\nsense of scientific discourse without taking seriously those portions\nirredeemably committed to, e.g., numbers, we cannot make sense of\nscientific discourse without taking seriously those portions committed\nto, e.g., spatio-temporal relations (Quine 1981: 149\u201350). From a\nmethodological point of view, Russell deemed it more likely that an\nerror is concealed somewhere in Bradley\u2019s argument than that\nmodern science should have incorporated so fundamental a falsehood,\ni.e., portrayed a world of spatio-temporal relations when really there\nare none. Of course even if we have good or even overwhelming reason\nto think that Bradley\u2019s argument must be wrong, this\ndoesn\u2019t relieve us of the philosophical responsibility of\ndetermining where exactly Bradley slipped up.\n3. Reductionism about Internal Relations\n\nWhat about internal relations? Do we need to acknowledge their\nexistence? We distinguished 3 senses of \u201cinternal\nrelation\u201d in our preliminary discussion: internal relations are\ndetermined by the mere existence of the things they relate, or\ninternal relations are determined by the intrinsic characters of the\nthings they relate, or internal relations supervene upon the intrinsic\ncharacters of the things they relate. So, in one sense or another, it\nsuffices for the obtaining of an internal relation that either the\nthings it relates exist or that the things it relates have\nsuch-and-such intrinsic characters. On this basis, some philosophers\nhave concluded that there is no need to admit internal relations as\nadditional pieces of furniture in the Universe (Fisk 1972:\n146\u20139; Armstrong 1978b: 86; Campbell 1990: 99\u2013101; Simons\n2010: 204\u20135; 2014: 314\u20135; Lowe 2013: 242, 2016:\n105\u20136; Heil 2009: 316\u20137, 2012: 144\u20136, 2016: 130,\nLowe 2016:102\u201311, Kein\u00e4nen 2020). Why do they think this?\nTruths about internal relations aren\u2019t necessarily equivalent to\ntruths about the things they relate or the intrinsic characters of the\nthings they relate. Nevertheless, all the truths about internal\nrelations are determined by the existence or the intrinsic characters\nof the things they relate, or supervene upon them. So internal\nrelations are variously declared to be \u201cno addition of\nbeing\u201d (Armstrong) or \u201cabsent from the fundamental\nontology\u201d (Heil) or, more clearly, \u201cthere are no such\nthings\u201d (Simons).\n\nConsider an example:\n\nBen Vorlich, a Scottish mountain, is taller than Ben Vane, its\nneighbour.\nBen Vorlich is 3094 ft high whilst Ben Vane is 3002 ft.\n\n\n(1) and (2) aren\u2019t necessarily equivalent because Ben Vorlich\nmight have been taller than Ben Vane even if Ben Vorlich and Ben Vane\nhad had different heights from the ones they actually have, i.e., (2)\ndoesn\u2019t follow from (1). Nevertheless, Ben Vorlich\u2019s being\ntaller than Ben Vane is determined by its having the height it does\n(3094 ft) and Ben Vane\u2019s having the height it does (3002 ft); it\nisn\u2019t possible for these mountains to have the heights they do\nwhilst Ben Vorlich fail to be taller than Ben Vane. So the being\ntaller than relation is internal in Armstrong\u2019s sense. This\nrelation is also internal in Lewis\u2019s sense which, recall, relies\nupon comparison between pairs of a relation\u2019s relata (Lewis\n1986: 62). Ben Lomond doesn\u2019t stand to Ben More as Ben Vorlich\ndoes to Ben Vane, because Ben Lomond is 3196 ft, Ben More, 3852 ft.\nHence Ben Vorlich\u2019s being taller than Ben Vane supervenes, in\nLewis\u2019s sense, upon the heights of Ben Vorlich and Ben Vane. So\nonce Ben Vorlich and Ben Vane have been bestowed with their respective\nheights there is no need to admit a further (internal) relation to\naccount for Ben Vorlich\u2019s being taller than Ben Vane (Campbell\n1990: 100, 103; Lewis 1994: 294).\n\nThis, broadly speaking, reductionist argument is open to question in a\nvariety of respects. Some philosophers have maintained that it cannot\nbe effective because we literally perceive proportions and other\ninternal relations (Mulligan 1991; Hochberg 2013: 232). These\nrelations must exist, otherwise we couldn\u2019t perceive them. So,\nthey conclude, something must have gone wrong with this argument\nbecause it leads to the mistaken conclusion that there aren\u2019t\nany internal relations out there to be perceived.\n\nMore generally, this reductionist argument assumes that if an internal\nrelation \\(R\\) isn\u2019t required to perform the role of determining\nthat \\(R\\) holds between the things it relates, because that role has\nalready been discharged by the intrinsic characteristics of the things\nit relates, then \\(R\\) doesn\u2019t exist at all or doesn\u2019t\nconstitute \u201can addition to the world\u2019s furniture\u201d\n(Armstrong 1997: 87). But from the fact that \\(R\\) doesn\u2019t\nfulfill one role it doesn\u2019t follow that it isn\u2019t required\nto fulfill another. It doesn\u2019t follow because there may still be\nother good reasons for us to believe that internal relations exist, or\nconstitute \u201can addition to the world\u2019s\nfurniture\u201d.\n\nTo bring the issues here into focus we will need to take on board two\nfurther distinctions. First, the distinction between\ntruth-making and ontological commitment. A\ntruth-maker for a statement \\(S\\) is (at least) something the\nexistence of which determines (necessitates) that \\(S\\) is true\n(Armstrong 2004: 5\u20137). By contrast, something \\(x\\) is an\nontological commitment of \\(S\\) if, roughly speaking, \\(S\\) could not\nbe true unless \\(x\\) existed (Quine 169: 95). Typically, a statement\n\\(S\\) incurs ontological commitment to an entity or some entities\nbecause we refer to it or quantify over them when we make the\nstatement. It\u2019s easy to run truth-making and\nontological commitment together but it\u2019s important to\nkeep them separate. A statement \\(S\\) cannot be true unless the\nentities to which \\(S\\) is ontologically committed exist. So\nit\u2019s a necessary condition of the truth of \\(S\\) that\nthe entities to which \\(S\\) is ontologically committed exist. By\ncontrast, it\u2019s a sufficient condition for the truth of\n\\(S\\) that a truth-maker for \\(S\\) exist because a truth-maker for\n\\(S\\) determines that \\(S\\) is true.\n\nArmed with the distinction between truth-making and ontological\ncommitment, we are now able to state a very general shortcoming of the\nargument. Let it be agreed that Ben Vorlich\u2019s being the height\nit is and Ben Vane\u2019s being the height it is together make true\nthe claim that Ben Vorlich is taller than Ben Vane; so no further\ntruth-makers are required for this claim to be true. But it\ndoesn\u2019t follow that we aren\u2019t ontologically committed to\nthe existence of an internal relation between Ben Vorlich and Ben Vane\nwhen we make this claim. We surely are ontologically committed to Ben\nVorlich and Ben Vane when we make the claim that one is taller than\nthe other even though they\u2019re not themselves truth-makers for\nthis claim. They\u2019re not truth-makers for this claim because they\nmight have existed even though Ben Vane was taller than Ben Vorlich or\nthe same height. But recognising that the class of ontological\ncommitments and the class of truth-makers for a given claim may be\ndifferent classes opens up the possibility that we may be\nontologically committed to an internal relation between Ben Vorlich\nand Ben Vane even though this relation isn\u2019t a truthmaker for\nthis claim either (MacBride 2011: 162\u20136).\n\nThe second distinction we need is between thick and\nthin relations (Mulligan 1998: 342\u20137). Some examples.\nThick relations: loves, kills, gives. Thin\nrelations: identity, resemblance, greater\nthan. Thick relations have more of a \u201cmaterial\u201d\ncontent and are less \u201cformal\u201d than thin relations. It\ncorrespondingly makes more sense to think of thick relations as\n\u201ctopic-neutral\u201d. Thin relations, by contrast to thick\nrelations, are typically internal (see Clementz 2014 and Johansson\n2014 for further discussion of the thick/thin distinction).\n\nWe are now equipped state another, more specific gap in the\nreductionist argument. Whilst Ben Vorlich and Ben Vane\u2019s having\nthe heights they do avoids the need to admit the existence of a thick\n(internal) relation that Ben Vorlich bears to Ben Vane, this\ndoesn\u2019t avoid the need to admit the existence of a thin\n(internal) relation. This is because we need to explain why Ben\nVorlich\u2019s having the height it does (3094 ft) and Ben\nVane\u2019s having the height it does (3004 ft) entails that Ben\nVorlich is taller than Ben Vane. The answer is that the thin relation\nbeing greater than holds between the number of feet in height\nthat Ben Vorlich has and the number of feet in height that Ben Vane\nhas (Russell 1903: \u00a7214; Bigelow & Pargetter 1990:\n55\u20136. So internal relations may not (in general) be required to\nperform the role of truth-makers for comparative claims. Nonetheless\nthin internal relations may perform an indispensable role in\nexplaining why the truth-makers for comparative claims are equipped to\nmake such claims true, rather than leaving this a matter of brute\ninexplicable necessity\u2014because, in this case, the heights of the\nmountains in question lie in a certain relation of proportion to one\nanother. Similarly Ben Vorlich\u2019s being taller than Ben\nVane\u2019s supervenes upon their heights but this is only\nintelligible because the height of Ben Vorlich is larger than the\nheight of Ben Vane.\n\nThis leaves us a choice. Either we can rewind the argument and admit\ninternal relations, whether thick or thin, as additions to the\nworld\u2019s furniture (Bigelow & Pargetter 1990: 56\u201360).\nOr we can adopt the more austere view that only admits thin (internal)\nrelations to hold amongst intrinsic characteristics (Mulligan 1998:\n347).\n\nThe situation may be summed up in schematic terms. There are true\ncomparative claims of the form \\(a\\Rel b\\) which are either determined\nto be true by, or supervene upon, the intrinsic natures of the things\nthey relate, \\(Fa \\amp Gb\\). Philosophers of a reductionist persuasion\nhave argued that this shows there is no need to admit an internal\nrelation \\((R)\\) over and above the intrinsic characteristics or\nmonadic foundations of the things related \\((F, G)\\). But the\nintrinsic characteristics of the things related only determine the\ntruth of the claim that \\(a\\Rel b\\), or the truth of the claim that\n\\(a\\Rel b\\) only supervenes upon \\(Fa \\amp Gb\\), because these\ncharacteristics stand in an internal relation themselves, \\(F \\fR G\\).\nBecause the monadic foundations, \\(Fa\\) and \\(Gb\\), are only empowered\nto determine that \\(a\\Rel b\\) because \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) lie in this\ninternal relation, \\(\\fR\\), it follows that internal relations still\nperform an indispensable role in our theorising about the world. One\nline of response to this argument is to deny that the ontological\ncommitments and the truth-makers for a claim might come apart by\ndefining ontological commitment in terms of truth making, by roughly\nspeaking, maintaining that to be is to be a truth-maker, but then an\nalternative theory of truth will need to be provided for ordinary and\nformal languages if quantificational structure is never ontologically\ncommitting and it unclear whether this can be done (Heil 2016: 129;\nMacBride 2018: 157).\n\nThe case against reductionism about internal relations has proceeded\nso far from a relatively a priori basis. But there\u2019s\nalso a case to be made against it on a posteriori grounds.\nGrant for the sake of argument the claim that if a relation is\ninternal then it doesn\u2019t count as an ontological addition. The\nsignificance of this claim, when it comes to providing an inventory of\nthe world\u2019s furniture, depends upon the extent to which\nrelational truths have monadic foundations. But relativity theory,\nquantum theory and even classical mechanics provide an a\nposteriori basis for doubting that there are very many, if any,\n\\(F\\)s and \\(G\\)s capable of serving as monadic foundations for target\n\\(R\\)s, i.e., intrinsic properties to which a significant range of\nrelations may be reduced.\n\nIt is often taken for granted by metaphysicians that the fundamental\nquantities of physics provide a ready source of monadic foundations\nbecause physical quantities are intrinsic characteristics. The vision\nof reality metaphysicians typically ascribe to physics is akin to\nLewis\u2019s doctrine of \u201cHumean Supervenience\u201d,\naccording to which there are intrinsic properties which need nothing\nbigger than a point to be instantiated and there\u2019s no difference\nwithout a difference in the arrangement of intrinsic properties over\npoints (Lewis 1986: ix\u2013xvi). And certainly some metaphysicians\nhave endeavoured to make good upon this vision, arguing, for example,\nthat velocity is an intrinsic property (Tooley 1988; Bigelow &\nPargetter 1990: 62\u201382). But not only is this view contentious,\nthere are many other notions in classical mechanics, such as force,\nstress, strain and elasticity, represented using vectors and tensors,\nthat belie the conception of fundamental physical quantities as\nintrinsic (Butterfield 2006, 2011).\n\nWhen we turn from classical mechanics to relativity theory and quantum\ntheory, the a posteriori case against conceiving physical\nquantities as intrinsic is even stronger. Consider mass and charge,\nmost metaphysicians\u2019 favourite and commonly relied upon examples\nof intrinsic properties of a piece of matter (in particular a point\nparticle). In relativity theory, mass is identified with energy\n(\u201cmass-energy\u201d). In a relativistic field theory, such as\nMaxwell\u2019s theory of electromagnetism, the all-pervading\nelectromagnetic field has mass-energy. It also has momentum, stress\nand other traditionally mechanical properties. So mass is no longer\nconceived as an intrinsic property of localized lumps of stuff, let\nalone of point particles. Furthermore, the attribution of mass,\nmomentum, stress, etc., to the electromagnetic field, or to a matter\nfield such as a continuous fluid, depends upon the metrical structure\nof spacetime. So these quantities are not intrinsic, but, rather,\nrelational properties. They are properties that the radiation or\nmatter field in question has in virtue of its relation to spacetime\nstructure (Lehmkuhl 2011).\n\nIn quantum theory there are even fewer candidates for intrinsic\nproperties. Even in elementary quantum mechanics, the closest analogue\nof a point particle as classically understood (\u201ca quantum\nparticle\u201d) is an all-pervading field, viz. an\nassignment, for each instant of time, of a (complex) number to every\npoint of space. Here, the mass of the quantum particle cannot be\nattributed to any single point of space, but must be associated with\nthe whole field, although not in the simple manner of \u201cspreading\nthe mass out\u201d as a classical mass density distribution. (The\nsame remark applies to the quantum particle\u2019s charge.) Turning\nto quantum field theory: here again, the notion of particle is\nradically changed from the idea of a classical point particle\nand from the idea of a quantum particle. There are not\nvarious quantum particles, each of them represented by a\ncomplex-valued field as above, and each of them, say, electrons.\nRather there is a single all-pervading electron field and\neach electron, as treated in elementary quantum mechanics, is replaced\nby a unit of energetic excitation of the electron field. The same goes\nfor other types of matter, such as quarks. According to quantum field\ntheory, quarks are really excitations of an all-pervading quark field.\nBesides, quantum field theory exhibits a second, and fundamentally\ndifferent, way in which mass and charge fail to be intrinsic\nproperties. This goes under the label of\n\u201crenormalization\u201d. In short, the mass and charge of a\nparticle \u00e0 la quantum field theory, i.e., a unit of\nexcitation of an all-pervading field, depends upon the length-scale at\nwhich you choose to describe, or to experimentally probe, the field\n(Butterfield 2014, 2015).\n\nSo, to sum up this case against reductionism about relations: there\nseem to be far fewer (if any) monadic physical properties than the\nreductionist view needs. But this it is not the only case that has\nbeen made. It has also been argued on the basis of quantum\nentanglement, the fact that the quantum states of entangled particles\ncannot be described independently of one another, that physics is\ncommitted to relations that don\u2019t supervene upon intrinsic\nproperties (Teller 1986). More radically, it has been argued that a\nconsideration of quantum entanglement pushes us towards the\nmetaphysical outlook that there are no intrinsic properties (Esfeld\n2004, 2016) or even that there are no objects but only relations\n(French & Ladyman 2003; Ladyman & Ross 2007: 130\u201389,\nLadyman 2016; for objections see Psillos 2001, 2006, Brince\u00f1o\n& Mumford 2016).\n\nConsider next the related suggestion that spatio-temporal relations\nare internal relations between, variously, space-time points, regions\nor events (Simons 2010: 207\u20138, 2014: 312\u20134; Simons 2016:\n2010: 207\u20138; Heil 2012: 147; Lowe 2016: 109\u2013111). General\nrelativity makes serious trouble for this suggestion. The thinking\nbehind the suggestion is that it belongs to the essential natures of\nspace-time points, etc., that they bear the catalogue of\nspatio-temporal relations they do. In philosophy of physics, the view\nis called \u201cmetrical essentialism\u201d, the doctrine that\npoints have their metrical properties and relations essentially\n(Maudlin 1988). From metrical essentialism it follows that the mere\nexistence of a point, etc., already suffices to determine that it\ninhabits this network of spatio-temporal relations. Hence, it is\nargued, there is no need to admit spatio-temporal relations, or at\nleast consider spatio-temporal relations as ontological additions to\nthe furniture of the Universe. But, as well as the a priori\nconcerns already aired, this argument for refusing to admit\nspatio-temporal relations as ontological additions is encumbered by\nthe a posteriori difficulties of the metrical essentialism it\npresupposes.\n\nThese difficulties for metrical essentialism arise from the fact that\nin general relativity space-time structure varies from one model,\ni.e., possible world, to another (Butterfield 1989: 16\u201327). We\ncannot leave points or regions to themselves to settle their internal\nrelations, because general relativity denies the idea of a\nspatial-temporal framework whose make-up is settled independently of\nthe matter or radiation. So there isn\u2019t a stable\nonce-and-for-all class of points or regions which once posited suffice\nfor the purposes of modern physics, hence no stable class of\ntruth-makers that suffice for making all the distance-duration claims\ntrue.\n\nIt may help to understand this debate about space-time points if we\nconsider the following line of response on behalf of metrical\nessentialism. According to metrical essentialism, points have their\nmetrical properties and relations, i.e., space-time framework,\nessentially. So if the space-time framework differs between models\nthen the points must differ between models too. But this view\nisn\u2019t compromised by the fact, as Butterfield (1989) points out,\nthat in general relativity the space-time framework varies from one\nmodel to another; it only follows that the points must vary between\nthese models too. What, however, this line of response fails to take\ninto account is how extremely fragile spatio-temporal relations must\nbe conceived to be when metrical essentialism is combined with general\nrelativity.\n\nTake a possible world which is truly described by a dynamical theory\nof space-time (i.e., described by general relativity and any likely\nsuccessor to it). Now take a second possible world which differs from\nthe first only with respect to a tiny change, on a millimeter scale as\nregards length, and on a milligram scale as regards mass. This\ninvolves altering spatio-temporal relations throughout the entire\nuniverse. Hence it\u2019s a consequence of metrical essentialism that\nin the second possible world, all space-time points are non-identical\nto those in the first. But surely it\u2019s implausible that such a\nsmall adjustment should add up to such a world-altering difference\n(thanks here to Jeremy Butterfield).\n\nWe are now in a position to evaluate David Lewis\u2019s claim that\nwhilst distance relations fail to supervene on the intrinsic\ncharacters of the things they relate, there is nevertheless a\ndifferent way in which relations of distance do supervene on intrinsic\ncharacter:\n\n\nIf, instead of taking a duplicate of the electron and a duplicate of\nthe proton, we take a duplicate of the whole atom, then it will\nexhibit the same electron-proton distance as the original atom.\nAlthough distance fails to supervene on the intrinsic nature of the\nrelata taken separately, it does supervene on the intrinsic nature of\nthe composite of the relata taken together \u2013 in this case the\ncomposite hydrogen atom. (1986: 62)\n\n\nThis remark has suggested to some philosophers that we can do away\nwith relations generally because we need only posit the composites\nupon whose intrinsic nature the relation supervenes (Parsons 2009:\n223\u20135). But Lewis\u2019s view and the more general form of\nreductionism inspired by it encounter a dilemma. Either (1) the\ncomposite is just the proton and electron taken together. But then the\ndistance between them fails to supervene upon the intrinsic character\nof the composite, because there are duplicates of the proton and\nduplicates of the electron that vary in distance. Or (2) the composite\nis more than just the proton and electron, i.e., the proton and\nelectron related together in some (external) way. But then we\nhaven\u2019t gotten rid of external relations in favour of internal\nones but only presupposed them.\n\nCan this dilemma for Lewis be sidestepped by the following manoeuvre?\nSuppose the composite is the mereological fusion of the proton and the\nelectron. Then can\u2019t we say that the fusion has its intrinsic\ncharacter, and the distance relation between the parts of the fusion\nsupervenes on this character?\n\nBut this can\u2019t be enough to say. We don\u2019t really have any\nidea of what the intrinsic properties of fusions are because the\naxioms of mereology are silent about the intrinsic characters of\nfusions. So we don\u2019t really have any idea of whether the\ndistance relations of their parts supervene upon their properties.\nPerhaps fusions don\u2019t have much, if any, intrinsic character!\nSince we don\u2019t know much about these things, we\u2019re not in\na position to rule out the possibility of a duplicate of Lewis\u2019s\nproton-electron fusion being a fusion that has parts which are a\ndifferent distance apart than the original proton and electron Lewis\ndescribed.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s no logical bar to putting forward a theory\nthat posits a rich supply of fusions whose intrinsic natures are such\nthat the distance relations that hold between the parts of these\nfusions supervenes upon their intrinsic characters. But why believe\nsuch a theory? It\u2019s difficult to see how the supervenience of\ndistance relations upon intrinsic characters of fusions could ever be\nexplained (\u2019superdupervenience\u2019), because it\u2019s\ndifficult to see how an intrinsic property \\(F\\) of one thing \\(X\\)\ncan intelligibly give rise to an external relation \\(R\\) between two\nother things \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), even if \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are parts of\n\\(X\\).\n\nFinally, in the light of the foregoing discussion, Lewis\u2019s view\nis open to an objection from physics: there is no absolute fact of the\nmatter about the distance between the electron and proton\nindependently of facts about the physical fields more generally, e.g.,\nthe electromagnetic field and the electron field, i.e., facts\nconcerning what is happening elsewhere. So the distance relation of\nthe electron and fusion cannot supervene upon the intrinsic character\nof the proton-electron fusion. It follows that distance relations\ncannot be external in Lewis\u2019s sense.\n4. The Nature of Relations: Order and Direction\n\nSupposing they exist, what is the nature of relations, whether\ninternal or external? It is the crucial feature of binary\nnon-symmetric relations, which distinguishes them from binary\nsymmetric relations, or, more generally, distinguishes relations which\nfail to be strictly symmetric from strictly symmetric ones, that they\nbestow order upon the things they relate. Non-symmetric relations do\nso, because they admit of differential application, i.e., for\nany such relation there are multiple ways in which it potentially\napplies to the things it relates. So, in particular, for every binary\nnon-symmetric \\(R\\), \\(a\\Rel b \\ne b\\Rel a\\). But can we say anything\nmore about how it is possible for non-symmetric relations to admit of\ndifferential application? More generally, can we say anything\ndiscursive about the origins of order?\n\nAccording to what is sometimes called the \u201cstandard\u201d\naccount of non-symmetric relations, we can (Russell 1903: \u00a794;\nGrossman 1983: 164; Paul 2012: 251\u20132). A non-symmetrical\nrelation \\(R\\) has a direction whereby it travels\nfrom one thing to another. What distinguishes\n\\(a\\Rel b\\) from \\(b\\Rel a\\) is that \\(R\\) runs from \\(a\\) to \\(b\\) in\nthe former case and \\(b\\) to \\(a\\) in the latter. So differential\napplication is possible because non-symmetric relations have\ndirection, i.e., because non-symmetric relations run one way, rather\nthan another, amongst the things they relate. (See Johansson 2011 for\nan argument that \u2018direction\u2019 is really a cluster term\ncovering different logical and intentional notions.)\n\nThe standard account faces the serious objection that it is liable to\nover-generate relations, specifically converse ones, giving\nrise to an over-abundance of states that results from the\nholding of converse relations (Fine 2000: 2\u20135; cf. Russell 1913:\n85\u20137; Casta\u00f1eda 1975: 239\u201340; Armstrong 1978b: 42,\n94; for related puzzles arising out of the commitments of Armstrong\n1997, see Hochberg 1999: 157\u201360, Cross 2000 and Newman 2002).\nEmploying the notion of direction that the standard account\nuses to explain order, we can define the converse of a non-symmetric\n\\(R\\) as the relation \\(R^*\\) that runs from \\(b\\) to \\(a\\) whenever\n\\(R\\) runs from \\(a\\) to \\(b\\). But once given this notion of a\n(distinct) converse, it is difficult to deny that \\(R\\) has a\nconverse. This is because it would be arbitrary to admit the existence\nof \\(R\\) whilst denying its converse (or vice versa). Hence,\nthe standard view is committed to the general principle,\n\n(Converses) Every non-symmetric relation has a distinct\nconverse.\n\nBut the admission of converse relations threatens to conflict with two\nplausible sounding principles about the number of states that arise\nfrom the holding of non-symmetric relations and their converses.\n\n(Identity) Any state that arises from the holding of a\nrelation \\(R\\) is identical to a state that arises from the holding of\nits converse \\(R^*\\).\n\n(Uniqueness) No one state arises from the holding of more\nthan one relation.\n\nSupport for Identity is garnered from intuitions: that the\ncat\u2019s being on top of the mat is the very same state as\nthe mat\u2019s being underneath the cat, that Obama\u2019s\nbeing taller than Putin is the very same state as\nPutin\u2019s being shorter than Obama, and so on.\nUniqueness is based upon more overtly theoretical grounds.\nStates are often conceived as complexes of things, properties and\nrelations. They are, so to speak, metaphysical molecules built up from\ntheir constituents, so states built up from different things or\nproperties or relations cannot be identical. Hence it cannot be the\ncase that the holding of two distinct relations give rise to the same\nstate.\n\nNow one problem with the standard view is that\nConverses, Identity and Uniqueness form an\ninconsistent triad, assuming there are non-symmetric relations. Take\nthe cat\u2019s being on top of the mat. Identity dictates\nthat this state is the very same state as the mat\u2019s being under\nthe cat. But if there is only one state in play here,\nUniqueness tells us that this state can only arise from the\nholding of one relation. So the relation that holds between the cat\nand the mat in virtue of which the cat is on top of the mat must be\nidentical to the relation that holds between the cat and the mat in\nvirtue of which the mat is underneath the cat. But this conflicts with\nConverses which tells us these relations are distinct.\n\nIn the face of this inconsistency a number of theoretical options are\nopen to us. If we wish to maintain the standard view that\nnon-symmetric relations have direction then something has to give. (1)\nEither we can give up Identity, Uniqueness, or both,\nor we can ditch Converses. Indeed it has been argued that\nConverses should be ditched anyway because it gives rise to a\nspecial kind of semantic indeterminacy: we cannot establish by our use\nof a sign for a binary non-symmetric relation \\(R\\) that we mean to\npick it out rather than its converse \\(R^*\\). This is because\nwe can shift the referent of a predicate from a given relation to its\nconverse whilst leaving undisturbed the truth conditions of the\nstatement in which the predicate occurs by making compensating\nadjustments to the manner in which the names flanking the predicate\nare interpreted (Williamson 1985: 252\u201355, 1987; van Inwagen\n2006: 458\u201368 but see Liebesman 2013 for a reply to Williamson).\nBut whether Converses is ditched to avoid semantic\nindeterminacy, or because Converses, Identity and\nUniqueness form an inconsistent triad, or for some other\nreason, the link between Converses and the standard view will\nhave to be broken. (2) Alternatively we can jettison\nConverses but throw out the standard view with it. But if\nthat\u2019s the option we choose, then we will have to go back to the\ndrawing board to provide a fresh account of differential application\nthat doesn\u2019t appeal to direction.\n\nThere is certainly room for development if we go down route (1). The\nintuitions that provide evidence for Identity are, like\nintuitions generally, considered by many philosophers to be relatively\nweak sources of evidence, because there may be all variety of\npsychological, historical and sociological forces responsible for our\nholding this or that view to be intuitive which have little to do with\nwhether the view is true or credible. There\u2019s also a tradition\nof conceiving states or facts as capable of being analysed into more\nthan one collection of constituents, i.e., a tradition that denies\nUniqueness (Frege 1884: \u00a764; Hodes 1982; see Macbride\n2007: 54\u201355 and Liebesman 2014 for counterarguments to\nFine\u2019s assumption; but see Leo 2013 for a view which denies\nuniqueness for states).\n\nAlternatively we may leave Identity and Uniqueness\nin place but question whether the standard view really does give rise\nto Converses. According to one line of thought (Russell 1913:\n86\u20137), it would be arbitrary for us to choose from the inside,\nso to speak, one binary non-symmetric relation at the expense of its\nconverse. But, it may be argued, this doesn\u2019t preclude nature\nchoosing for us from the outside, providing an externalist rather than\nan internalist foundation for admitting a non-symmetric relation but\nnot its converse. Nevertheless, even if Converses is ditched\nthere is another obstacle to the standard view, namely that it appears\nto give rise to questions about direction for which there are no\nsensible answers, even if doesn\u2019t over-generate converse\nrelations and states to house them (MacBride 2014: 5\u20137,\n9\u201310). Consider the states, (a) Antony is married to Fulvia and\n(b) Antony is to the left of Fulvia. If these states arise from their\nrespective relations travelling from one thing they relate to another,\nthen there must be a fact of the matter about which things proceed\nfrom and which to. So, we may ask, do they both proceed from the same\nthing or do they proceed from different things? It doesn\u2019t seem\nthat there could be a sensible answer to this question and so we\nshould avoid an account of differential application that commits us to\nthere being such recherch\u00e9 and undetectable facts of the\nmatter. (But note that whilst many philosophers have felt the pull of\nthese kind of intuitive considerations, others have argued that is is\nnecessary to introduce ordinal properties or relations to impose\nstructure upon relational facts. For example, Hochberg posits\n\u201cordering relations\u201d (Hochberg 1987, 1999: 180\u201381)\nwhilst Tegtmeier posits \u201cordinators\u201d, such as\n\u201ccoming first\u201d and \u201ccoming second\u201d in a fact\n(Tegtmeier 1990, 2004, 2016).)\n\nWhat are the options if we go down route (2)? Some philosophers have\nsuggested that if we ditch Converses then we will have to\ngive up non-symmetric relations altogether (van Inwagen 2006: 453).\nBut this presupposes that the only way to account for the distinctive\nfeature of non-symmetric relations, viz. differential\napplication, is to appeal to the standard view. However, philosophers\nthat go down this second route endeavour to account for differential\napplication by different means than direction and thereby\nearn the right to hold onto non-symmetric relations. We can\ndistinguish three broad strategies for explaining differential\napplication without direction, namely (1) positionalism, (2)\nanti-positionalism, and (3) primitivism, although\nthis does not exhaust the range of possibilities considered in the\nliterature (consider, for example, the view that relations are\nproperties of sequences discussed above (sec. 1).\n\nFirst, positionalism may be roughly sketched as the view that\nan \\(n\\)-ary relation has \\(n\\) argument positions, where argument\npositions are conceived as themselves entities, and, crucially, there\nis no intrinsic order to the argument places of a relation; neither\nargument position of a binary relation is the first or the second,\netc. (Casta\u00f1eda 1972, 1975; Williamson 1985: 257; Grossman\n1992: 57; Armstrong 1997: 90\u20131; Cross 2002: 219\u2013223, Fine\n2000: 10\u201316; Orilia 2011; Gilmore 2013). In the case of a binary\nnon-symmetric relation \\(R\\), this amounts to the idea that \\(R\\) is\nassociated with two further entities, % and #, its argument positions,\nand \\(R\\) holds between two given relata \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) relative to\nan assignment of objects to % and #. The difference between \\(a\\Rel\nb\\) and \\(b\\Rel a\\) (differential application) is then explained in\nterms of the different relative assignments of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) to %\nand #: \\(a\\) to % and \\(b\\) to # in one case, and \\(b\\) to % and \\(a\\)\nto # in the other. But since the argument positions do not themselves\nexhibit any significant order or direction, there is no basis here for\nintroducing converses, i.e., relations that differ only with respect\nto their direction of travel.\n\nDifferent versions of positionalism vary with regard to\n\\((i)\\) the nature of argument positions, crucially upon whether they\ncan be shared by different relations, and \\((ii)\\) the variety of\nargument positions, whether there are different kinds of position\nspecifically suited to different kinds of relata, and \\((iii)\\) the\ncomplexity of the relation whereby things are assigned to positions.\nAccording to Orilia\u2019s onto-thematic role view,\npositions are capable of recurring in different relations and suited\nby their nature to different sorts of filling (Orilia 2011, 2014,\nPaolini Paoletti 2016, 2018b sec. 2, and for an earlier version\ninspired by Leibniz, Orilia 2008). For example, the loves\nrelation has agent and patient roles, roles which also recur in the\nhates relation. Other more complex relations involve more and\ndifferent roles, for example, theme, location, instrument, goal\netc. Orilia\u2019s idea is that the schedule of ontological\nroles belonging to relations should be informed by the linguistic\nprogramme of identifying thematic roles in natural language because\nthis helps us to provide informative generalisations about what\ndifferent relations have in common (see Davis 2011 for a helpful\nintroduction to the thematic role literature in linguistics).\n\nBy contrast, other versions of positionalism conceive of\npositions as unique to the relations in which they figure. Some\npositionalists of this stripe conceives of each position as being\nassigned a unique occupant (Gilmore 2013). But others whilst sharing\nthe assumption that positions are unique to the relations in which\nthey figure, also maintain that it is a mistake to assume that there\nis a 1-1 correspondence between positions and their occupants. So this\nversion of positonalism conceives relations more liberally as having\npositions capable of being assigned several distinct occupants at once\n(see, for example, Armstrong 1997: 91, Yi 1999: 169; Fine 2000: 17,\nMacBride 2005: 588). Further sophistication is added by the idea that\npositions can be occupied by a number of things varying between fixed\nlimits (Hazen&Taylor 1992: 376, 390, Dixon 2018: 207) and by the\nsuggestion that the assignment of things to positions should also be\nrelative to a number to allow for one and the same thing to\nsimultaneously occur more than once in the same position (Dixon 2018:\n213\u20136).\n\nA different line is taken by Donnelly\u2019s relative\npositionalism, according to which positions are a kind of\n\u201crelative property\u201d (Donnelly 2016). Donnelly takes\nbeing north as an example of a relative property: a property\nbecause it is had by one thing but only relative to something else, in\nthis case a location. Her basic idea is that corresponding to each\nn-ary relation R is a package of relative properties\n(as many as n factorial properties) such that when n\nthings instantiate R they instantiate these properties relative to one\nanother (Donnelly 2016: 91). It is a distinctive feature of the view\nthat by positing for each relation a bespoke package of relative\nproperties which models the logical character of the relation in\nquestion, relative positonalism is able to handle relations\nof arbitrary complexity, including symmetric and partially symmetric\nrelations (Donnelly 2016: 88\u201396, Dixon 2019: 56\u201367). By\ncontrast, the onto-thematic role approach doesn\u2019t\nprovide a once and for all recipe for positing roles but takes this to\nbe a matter to be settled by systematic \u201contological\ninvestigation\u201d into the character of relations as we find them\n(Orilia 2014: 296\u2013301 but see objections from MacBride 2014:\n11\u201312, Ostertag 2019: 1492\u20135).\n\nThere are two immediate challenges faced by the different versions of\npositionalism. Can the account be generalized to cover all\nrelations? If, for example, the binary symmetric relation that holds\nbetween two things \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) whenever \\(a\\) is next to \\(b\\) has\ntwo argument positions, \u00a3 and $, then there should be two\npossible ways of assigning \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) to \u00a3 and $. But this\nmeans (absurdly) that there are two different ways for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)\nto be next to one another, i.e., symmetric relations admit of\ndifferential application too! Orilia\u2019s onto-thematic\nrole approach handles this kind of case by conceiving of thematic\nroles as \u201cintra-repeatable\u201d (Orilia 2014: 294), so there\nis only one role or position in play in this relation (\u00a3 = $)\nand so the possibility of different assignments to different roles or\npositions doesn\u2019t arise. Similarly, Dixon\u2019s\n\u201cpocket\u201d theory handles this case by conceiving the\nnext to relation as having only one pocket. But, as Fine\n(2000: 17\u201318, 2007: 58\u20139) and MacBride (2007: 36\u201344)\nargue, and as Dixon (2018: 31, n.21) acknowledges, this kind of\nstrategy doesn\u2019t straightforwardly extend to more complex\npartially symmetric relations such as being arranged clockwise in\na circle in that very order, or, playing-tug-of-war.\nAccordingly Orilia (2011: 6\u20139, 2014: 296\u2013301) proposes a\nprogramme of analysis whereby more complex relations are reduced to\nsimpler ones that the onto-thematic role approach can accommodate. By\ncontrast, relative positionalism can handle these kinds of\npartially symmetric relations without any analysis (Donnelly 2016:\n88\u201396, Dixon 2019: 56\u201367), but not multigrade relations\nwhich lack a fixed arity n, hence cannot be modelled by a\nn! package of relative properties (Donnelly 2016: 94, Dixon\n2019: 59) (For further criticisms of positionalism see\nHochberg 1999: 153, 2000: 40\u20131).\n\nThe more general challenge that faces the different versions of\npositionalism is whether we have a better understanding of positions\nand the assignment relation that the different versions of\npositionalism propose, than we do of the relations that positions and\nassignment are used to explain (Fine 2000: 16; MacBride 2014:\n11\u201312; Orilia 2014: 302\u20133). Consider, for example,\nDonnelly\u2019s claim that the application of n-ary\nrelations needs to be explained in terms of packages of n!\nrelative properties. One problem, acknowledged by Donnelly (2016: 98),\nis the ontological cost of having to trade in each relation for so\nmany properties. Another problem concerns why relative properties of a\ngiven package cannot be instantiated independently of one another but\nonly relative to other properties belonging to that package, even\nthough each relative property is meant to be unary. The obvious\nexplanation is that such properties aren\u2019t unary at all but to\nbe explained in terms of an underlying relation (Bigelow &\nPargetter 1990: 55, MacBride: 2000: 83). So saying that one thing\nx has a property relative to something else y having\nanother relative property etc is more perspicuously rendered\nby saying that x bears a relation to y.\n\nBoth the standard view and the different versions of\npositionalism assume that the differential application of a\nnon-symmetric relation \\(R\\) with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is to be\nexplained \u201clocally\u201d in terms of \\(R\\), whether its\ndirection or argument positions, and the things it relates, \\(a\\) and\n\\(b\\). Anti-positionalism is the doctrine, due to Kit Fine,\nwhich eschews direction and argument positions and explains\ndifferential application by abandoning the assumption that\ndifferential application is to be explained locally (Fine 2000:\n20\u201332). According to anti-positionalism, the difference between\n\\(a\\Rel b\\) and \\(b\\Rel a\\) arises from how these states are\ninter-connected with other states that arise from \\(R\\) holding of\nother relata. So order is not a feature of given state capable of\nbeing isolated, but only emerges over a totality of states to which\n\\(R\\) gives rise. What distinguishes \\(a\\Rel b\\) from \\(b\\Rel a\\) is\nthat inter-connectedness with other states such as \\(c\\Rel d\\). Pay\nspecial attention to the relative arrangement of the schematic names\nin the following sentence. Whereas the state \\(a\\Rel b\\) is a\ncompletion of \\(R\\) by \\(a, b\\) in the same manner as \\(c\\Rel d\\) is a\ncompletion of \\(R\\) by \\(c, d\\), the state \\(b\\Rel a\\) isn\u2019t.\nThe state \\(b\\Rel a\\) is a completion of \\(R\\) by \\(b\\), \\(a\\) in the\nsame manner as \\(c\\Rel d\\) is a completion of \\(R\\) by \\(c, d\\) (Fine\n2000: 21). However, Fine doesn\u2019t take the notion of two states\nbeing put together \u201cin the same manner\u201d as primitive, but\nexplains this in terms of a substitution relation. To say that a state\n\\(s\\) is a completion of relation \\(R\\) by \\(a_1, a_2 \\ldots, a_n\\) in\nthe same manner as a state \\(t\\) is completion of \\(R\\) by \\(b_1, b_2\n\\ldots, b_n\\) is to say that \\(s\\) is completion of \\(R\\) by \\(a_1,\na_2 \\ldots, a_n\\) that results from simultaneously substituting \\(a_1,\na_2 \\ldots, a_n\\) for \\(b_1\\), b\\(_2 \\ldots, b_n\\) in \\(t\\) (and\nvice versa) (Fine 2000: 25\u20136). Fine goes on to suggest\nthat the notion of simultaneous substitution of many objects may be\ndefined, under certain conditions, in terms of the single substitution\nof one object (Fine 2000: 26 n. 15). Converses is avoided\nbecause the notion of direction, in terms of which the distinction\nbetween converse relations is drawn, is eschewed. This is because\nsubstitution is doing all the work.\n\nFine\u2019s version of anti-positionalism has certain\nlimitations, including the assumption that states arising from a\nsingle relation have a unique composition and that substitution\noperates on objects rather than occurrences of objects. Leo (2013)\nprovides a more fully developed version of anti-positonalism\nthat addresses these limitations from a more formal point of view.\nAccording to Leo, relational complexes are structured perspectives on\nstates \u2018out there\u2019 in reality, relational complexes have\noccurrences of objects, and different complexes of the same relation\nmay correspond to the same state. It is key to this approach that\nsubstitution is a primitive operation taking a complex and an\nassignment of objects to the occurrences of objects in the complex as\ninput and returning another complex as output. For example, for the\ncomplex of Anthony\u2019s loving Cleopatra, substituting Abelard for\nthe occurrence of Anthony and Eloise for the occurrence of Cleopatra\nresults in the complex of Abelard\u2019s loving Eloise. Substitution\nis identified in terms of basic principles governing substitutions, in\nparticular a composition principle, which forms the heart of an\nantipositional theory of relations (Leo 2013: 363; for further\ndevelopments and defence of this version of\nanti-positionalism, see Leo 2008a, 2008b, 2010, 2014,\n2016).\n\nBy abandoning the assumption that differential application is to be\nexplained locally, anti-positionalism in effect tells us that\nwe\u2019re misconceiving the logical form of our ordinary relational\njudgements. Contrary to their surface form, relational judgements\nalways have a suppressed argument position for other states, by which\nmeans the state we are making a judgement about is implicitly compared\nto another. The following two objections arise (MacBride 2007:\n47\u201353). First of all, anti-positionalism presupposes a\nnon-symmetric relation of substitution to explain differential\napplication. But this suggests that the explanation anti-positonalism\nprovides involves a circularity because it uses a non-symmetric\nrelation, substitution, whose differential application is take for\ngranted. Take the state \\(a\\Rel b\\). The result of substituting \\(a\\)\nfor \\(b\\) is the state \\(a\\Rel a\\); where the result of substituting\n\\(b\\) for \\(a\\) is the state \\(b\\Rel b\\). The outcomes are different\nso the substitution relation must be order sensitive. Secondly,\nanti-positionalism entails that there cannot be lonely binary\nrelations, i.e., relations which only hold of exactly two things. But\nprima facie we should be able to distinguish \\(a\\Rel b\\) from\n\\(b\\Rel a\\) even if \\(R\\) holds between nothing except \\(a\\) and\n\\(b\\), Antony\u2019s loving Cleopatra from Cleopatra\u2019s loving\nAntony even if the world is otherwise loveless (see, for replies to\nthese objections, Fine 2007: 59\u201362, Wieland 2010: 487\u201393,\nLeo 2014: 279\u201381).\n\nThe third strategy, primitivism, seeks to avoid the\ndifficulties that threaten positionalism and\nanti-positionalism by taking the radical step of asking us to\nreconfigure our explanatory settings. It\u2019s a familiar thought\nthat we cannot account for the fact that one thing bears a relation\n\\(R\\) to another by appealing to a further relation \\(R'\\) relating\n\\(R\\) to them\u2014that way Bradley\u2019s regress beckons. To avoid\nthe regress we must recognise that a relation is not related to the\nthings it relates, however language may mislead us to think otherwise.\nWe simply have to accept as primitive, in the sense that it cannot be\nfurther explained, the fact that one thing bears a relation to\nanother. But, according to primitivism, it is not only the fact\nthat one thing bears a (non-symmetric) relation \\(R\\) to\nanother that needs to be recognised as ultimate and irreducible.\nHow \\(R\\) applies, whether the \\(a\\Rel b\\) way or the \\(b\\Rel\na\\) way, needs to be taken as primitive too (MacBride 2014:\n14\u201315). The difficulties encountered by attempts to provide an\nanalysis of differential application provide corroborative evidence\nfor primitivism. Does refraining from providing an analysis of\ndifferential application constitute shirking an obligatory task for\nsystematic philosophy? Hardly. Remember what Lewis correctly said\nabout predication: \u201cNot every account is an\nanalysis\u201d (Lewis 1983: 352). What we need, according to\nthis third strategy, is a form of realism committed to the existence\nof relations but which denies that the manner of their application,\ntheir differential application, can be further explained.\n\nOne of the most intriguing features of the debate about relations and\ndifferential application is that there is no single sense in which the\ndifferent views we have considered seek to \u201cexplain\u201d or\n\u201caccount\u201d for differential application. They all run on\ndifferent explanatory settings. Some think there is a genuine problem\nto do with the capacity of relations to differentially apply which\nneeds to be explained by any successful theory of relations. Hence,\nbecause he thinks there is a genuine problem here, Hochberg claims\nthat the question which any adequate theory of relations must answer\n\u201cis about how the order is ontologically grounded in\nfacts\u201d (Hochberg 2001: 178). But others think that there\nisn\u2019t a problem of differential application at all, much less\none that requires an ontological analysis of relations or facts. This\nmeans that the debate cannot be reduced to simply an exchange of\nopinions about which view explains the most at the least cost.\n\nFor example, positionalists typically maintain that their positing\nroles, slots, pockets and relative properties enables them to answer\nwhat they take to be obligatory questions about why each relation\napplies the way it can and why some relations are capable of applying\ndifferently from the ways others can (Dixon 2019: 68). So the\ndifferent ways that the relations between and\nadjacency are capable of applying is explained by\npositionalists in terms of the different ontological structures\nattributed to these relations, i.e. their number of roles or\npositions and the nature of the relation that assigns things to roles\nor positions. By contrast, anti-positionalists and primitivists deny\nthat such questions about why relations have the capacity to\ndifferentially apply need answering at all. As Fine describes his own\nversion of anti-positionalism, \u201cIt is a fundamental\nfact for [the anti-positionalist] that relations are capable of giving\nrise to a diversity of completions in application to any given relata\nand there is no explanation of this diversity in terms of a difference\nin the way the completions are formed from the relation and its\nrelata\u201d (Fine 2000: 19).\n\nHowever, the explanatory differences between the parties to the debate\nrun deeper than merely whether they think the capacity of relations to\ndifferentially apply is open to informative explanation. Whilst Fine\ntakes the capacity of relations to differentially apply as primitive,\nFine also holds that it is necessary to provide an account of wherein\nthe difference consists between two states which arise from the same\nconstituents: \u201cYet clearly the state of Anthony\u2019s loving\nCleopatra and the state of Cleopatra\u2019s loving Anthony are\ndistinguishable; they are not merely two indiscernible\n\u201datoms\u201c within the space of states. But if these states\nare not to be distinguished by how they derive from the given relation\nand its relata, then how are they to be distinguished?\u201d(Fine\n2000: 20). Fine\u2019s answer, as we have seen, is spelled out in\nterms of substitution. But Leo\u2019s version of anti-positionalism\nhas different explanatory settings again. He doesn\u2019t engage with\nmetaphysical questions about wherein the difference between states\nconsists and instead provides principles of substitution intended to\nexplicate rather than explain the differential application of\nrelations (Leo 2013: 361\u20138). And primitivism, we have seen,\ntakes the fact that relations admit of differential application as\nunanalysable too but also takes the difference between states arising\nfrom the same constituents as primitive (MacBride 2014: 8,\ncf. van Fraassen 1982). The dispute about relations and\ndifferential application continues because it remains to be\nestablished which questions about relations are genuine and which are\npseudo-problems.\n\nIn conclusion, it should be emphasised that nothing written here is\nintended to imply that there is just one problem of order\n(differential application). It\u2019s plausible that there are\nseveral problems in the vicinity, whether logical, metaphysical or\nepistemological and they will require different if co-ordinated\nsolutions.\n",
