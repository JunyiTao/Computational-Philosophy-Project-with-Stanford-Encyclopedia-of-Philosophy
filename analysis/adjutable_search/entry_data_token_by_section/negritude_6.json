N\u00e9gritude as epistemology\n\nIn the same 1939 essay in which he explored what he called the\n\u201crhythmic attitude\u201d by which we enter in profound\nconnection with the object of art, its reality or its sub-reality,\nSenghor wrote the statement which is probably the most controversial\nof all his formulations of the philosophy of N\u00e9gritude:\n\u201cEmotion is Negro, as reason is Hellenic\u201d\n(\u201cL\u2019\u00e9motion est n\u00e8gre, comme la raison\nh\u00e9ll\u00e8ne\u201d). (Senghor 1964, 288) The criticism\nwas that the formula was an acceptance of the ethnological discourse\nof the Levy-Bruhlian type making a distinction between western\nsocieties suffused with rationality and the colonized world of what he\nlabeled \u201cinferior societies\u201d, under the rule of\n\u201cprimitive mentality\u201d. While rationality is defined by the\nuse of the logical principles of identity, contradiction and excluded\nmiddle and the empirical notion of causality, primitive mentality\nfunctions according to a law of \u201cparticipation\u201d and\nmagical thinking. The law means that a person can be herself and at\nthe same time be \u2013or rather participate in the being\nof\u2014her totem animal ignoring (or rather indifferent to) the\nprinciple of contradiction, and magical thinking, superposing a\nsupernatural world to reality, allows for example action from distance\nin the absence of any causal link between two phenomena. (Levy-Bruhl\n1926) For his critics, Senghor\u2019s formula did ratify the view of\nLucien Levy-Bruhl, while the ethnologist himself eventually recanted\nthem in his Notebooks of Lucien Levy-Bruhl posthumously\npublished ten years after his death in 1939. Aim\u00e9\nC\u00e9saire\u2019s famous lines from The Notebook for a Return\nto the Native Land echo Senghor\u2019s formula:\n\nThose who have invented neither powder nor the compass\n\nThose who have tamed neither gas nor electricity\n\nThose who have explored neither the seas nor the skies\n\n\u2026\n\nBut they abandon themselves, possessed, to the essence of all things\n\nIgnoring surfaces but possessed by the movement of all things\n\nHeedless, taking no account, but playing the game of the world.\n\nTruly the elder sons of the world\n\nPorous to every breath of the world\n\nFlesh of the flesh of the world throbbing with the very movement of\nthe world.\n\n\nJean-Paul Sartre who quoted these verses in Black Orpheus,\n(1976, 43\u201344) immediately after made this remark: \u201cUpon\nreading this poem, one cannot help but think of the famous distinction\nwhich Bergson established between intelligence and intuition\u201d\n(1976, 44). That remark makes an important point:\n\u201cemotion\u201d and \u201cintuition\u201d as approaches to\nreality in N\u00e9gritude philosophy have more to do with Bergsonian\nphilosophy than with Levy-Bruhlian ethnology. Donna Jones rightly\nspeaks of Negritude as an \u201cAfro-Bergsonian epistemology\u201d.\n(Jones, 2010) Senghor did use the language of the author of\nPrimitive Mentality, (Levy-Bruhl 1923) for example when he\nwrote in his 1956 article on \u201cNegro African Aesthetics\u201d\nthat \u201cEuropean reason is analytical by utilization, Negro reason\nis intuitive by participation\u201d (1964, 203). But he also stated\nclearly, as early as in 1945, six years after the essay in which the\n(in)famous formula was written: \u201cBut are the differences not in\nthe ratio between elements more than in their nature? Underneath the\ndifferences, are there not more essential similarities? Above all, is\nreason not identical among men? I do not believe in\n\u2018prelogical mentality.\u2019 The mind cannot be prelogical, and\nit can even less be alogical\u201d (1964, 42). This affirmation is\nclearly directed at Levy-Bruhl. So the influence on his thinking\nclaimed by Senghor is rather Henri Bergson\u2019s. The poet often\nrefers to the importance of the \u201c1889 Revolution\u201d, in\nreference to the year of publication of Bergson\u2019s Essay on\nthe immediate data of consciousness. Bergson, for Senghor, has\ngiven a philosophical expression to a new paradigm which, unlike\nCartesianism and, even before it, Aristotelianism, makes room for a\ntype of knowledge which does not divide by analysis the subject from\nthe object and the object into its constitutive separated parts:\ndifferent from the reason-that-separates, says Senghor following\nBergson, there is a reason-that-embraces, which makes us experience\n\u201cthe lived identity of knowledge and the known, the lived and\nthe thought, the lived and the real\u201d (1971, 287). That approach\nof reality is the other side of our analytical intelligence: according\nto Bergson, the push of life in evolution, the \u00e9lan\nvital, has produced consciousness. Now \u201cconsciousness, in\nman, is pre-eminently intellect. It might have been, it ought, so it\nseems, to have been also intuition. Intuition and intellect represent\ntwo opposite directions of the work of consciousness: intuition goes\nin the very direction of life, intellect goes in the inverse\ndirection, and thus finds itself naturally in accordance with the\nmovement of matter. A complete and perfect humanity would be that in\nwhich these two forms of conscious activity should attain their full\ndevelopment\u201d (Bergson 1944, 291\u2013292). Clearly Bergson does\nnot see \u201cintuition\u201d and \u201cintelligence\u201d as\ndividing humanity into different types: he calls for their equal\ndevelopment in a fully accomplished humanity.\n\nTwo conclusions can be drawn from Senghor\u2019s Bergsonism. First,\nthe epistemology of N\u00e9gritude, what he calls a Negro way of\nknowing does not simply reproduce Levy-Bruhl\u2019s radical cognitive\ndualism which ultimately divides humanity into two categories, the\nEuropean and the non-European. It is rather a way of emphasizing the\nrole played by what Bergson has called \u201cintuition\u201d in the\nproduction of African cultural objects, more particularly African art.\nBecause, and this is the second conclusion, when he speaks of an\nAfrican epistemology in fact Senghor is still speaking about art and\naesthetics. He is speaking about art as knowledge, art as a particular\napproach to reality, art as the realm par excellence of intuitive\nknowledge or emotion. That concept is to be understood in relation to\nthe distinction made by Henri Bergson in his 1932 book on The two\nsources of morality and Religion between two opposed notions\nof \u201cemotion\u201d. One that is a reaction, a \u201cstirring of\nsensibility by representation\u201d (Bergson 1932 [1977, 43]), and one that\nis \u201ca cause and not an effect\u201d, that is \u201cpregnant\nwith representations\u201d (Bergson 1932 [1977, 44]). The first Bergson\ncalls \u201cinfra-intellectual\u201d while the second is\n\u201csupra-intellectual\u201d (Bergson 1932 [1977, 44]). Clearly,\nSenghor\u2019s \u201cemotion\u201d corresponds to the creative one,\nthe one \u201cpregnant with representations\u201d. Its\nmeaning in Senghor\u2019s formula is also consonant\nwith its definition by Jean-Paul Sartre as a way of seeing the\nworld as a \u201cnon-instrumental totality\u201d: \u201cin this\ncase, writes Sartre, the categories of the world will act upon\nconsciousness immediately. They are present to it without\ndistance\u201d (Sartre 1989, 52,90).\n\nWe can now conclude with a reexamination of Senghor\u2019s infamous\nformula, which he kept explaining again and again: \u201cEmotion is\nNegro as Reason is Hellenic\u201d. To pay attention to the context in\nwhich it was written is to recall that Senghor, in the late 1930s was\nabsorbing not only ethnological literature but also writings about\n\u201cart n\u00e8gre\u201d. In particular a book that he refers to\nin a simple footnote but which was very influential on his thinking:\nPrimitive Negro Sculpture by Paul Guillaume and Thomas Munro,\npublished in the US in 1926 and translated into French in 1929. One of\nthe main points made in the book was to contrast Greco-Roman statuary\nexpressing the ideal of the beautiful form as it exists in reality\neven if it is transfigured by art and African sculpture as a\nmanifestation of the life force beneath the appearances of things.\nWhen that context is taken into account, it becomes clear that\nSenghor\u2019s neatly crafted formula (it is an alexandrine in\nFrench) can be read as an analogy: Hellenic art is to analytic reason\nwhat African art is to emotion. And thus it becomes less scandalous as\nthe simple expression of the Nietzschean way in which Senghor\u2019s\nN\u00e9gritude has considered art as knowledge and aesthetics as\nepistemology. As Abiola Irele has rightly remarked:\n\u201cSenghor\u2019s theory of the African method of knowledge and\nhis aesthetic theory\u201d are not just \u201cintimately related\n[but] even coincide\u201d (Irele 1990, 75). Senghor considers that\nmethod, that form of vital knowledge, as \u201cthe way\nof the Africans\u201d and he declares that Bergsonism represents but\n\u201ca return\u201d to it (Senghor, 1993, 125).\n",
