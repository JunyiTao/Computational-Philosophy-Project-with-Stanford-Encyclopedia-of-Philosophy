The Range of Actions: From \u201cAutomatic\u201d to \u201cDecomplex\u201d\n\nIn the Observations, Hartley offers a conceptually novel\ntreatment of physical action\u2014a topic largely absent from other\ntreatises, or inquiries, devoted to \u201chuman nature\u201d or\n\u201chuman understanding.\u201d Even in James Mill\u2019s\nAnalysis of the Phenomena of the Human Mind, a work with an\nacknowledged debt to Hartley, bodily action is touched on only in the\nlast chapter of the book, on \u201cThe Will.\u201d But to an\nattentive \u201cobserver of man,\u201d it should be obvious that we\nlive by doing, by performing tasks that depend on repertoires of\nperfected movement, some (like walking) mastered in infancy, others\n(like typing) later in life.\n\nHartley invented to two words to describe physical movements:\n\u201cautomatic\u201d and \u201cdecomplex.\u201d\n\nHartley formed the adjective \u201cautomatic\u201d from an existing\nnoun, \u201cautomaton,\u201d to describe movements such as\n\u201cthe motions of the heart, and the peristaltic motion of the\nbowels\u201d (OM 1, Introduction). Such \u201coriginally\nautomatic\u201d motions are homeostatic: As a heart beats, the\nalternation of contraction and relaxation is maintained and modified\nin response to the needs and experiences of the organism (OM\n1, prop. 19).\n\nFollowing the discussion of \u201coriginally automatic\u201d motion\nis this theorem: \u201cIf any sensation A, idea B, or motion C, be\nassociated \u2026 with any other sensation D, idea E, or muscular\nmotion F, it will, at last, excite d, the simple idea belonging to\nsensation D, the very idea E, or the very muscular motion F\u201d\n(OM 1, prop. 20). Through the physical association or neural\nimpulses in the brain, any sensation, idea, or muscular motion can\nbecome the stimulus that excites any other idea or muscular motion.\nOne\u2019s heart beats faster at the sight, sound, or thought of\nsomething one has learned to fear.\n\nThe formation of such novel associations of stimuli to physiological\nresponses means that \u201coriginally automatic\u201d motions can\ntransform into motions that are \u201cvoluntary\u201d or\n\u201csecondarily automatic\u201d (OM 1, prop. 21).\n\nAn action is voluntary when its stimulus is an \u201cidea, or state\nof mind \u2026 which we term the will\u201d (OM 1, prop.\n21). To illustrate how ideas of the form \u201cthe will to\n\u2026\u201d derive from \u201coriginally automatic\u201d\nmotions, Hartley describes how a child gains motor control over parts\nand functions of her body. \u201cOriginally automatic\u201d motions\nare brought under control through a series of substitutions of the\ninitiating stimulus. An infant grasps the finger placed in her palm,\nand then the toy she sees, and then grasps at \u201cthe sound of the\nwords grasp, take hold, &c., the sight of the nurse\u2019s hand,\nin that state, the idea of a hand, and particularly the child\u2019s\nown hand.\u201d These and \u201cinnumerable other associated\ncircumstances \u2026 will put the child upon grasping, till, at\nlast, that idea, or state of mind which we may call the will to grasp,\nis generated and sufficiently associated with the action to produce it\ninstantaneously.\u201d\n\nIt is important to note that, in Hartley\u2019s account, the\nperformance of a voluntary movement is not a dualistic, two-stage\nprocess, with an executive \u201cfaculty\u201d of the Mind, the\nWill, first issuing an instruction that the body then carries out.\nRather, a movement becomes voluntary through the living being\u2019s\ninteraction with the \u201cinnumerable \u2026 associated\ncircumstances\u201d of its environment, which interactions bring\nabout a series of substitutions of the initiating stimulus. In this\nlight, \u201cwill\u201d does not name anything substantive: it is a\nword we use to describe an \u201cidea, or state of mind.\u201d And\nit is a word people often use to express bafflement as to what this\n\u201cstate of mind\u201d amounts to. Hartley notes that adults\nstart calling a child willful at the time he learns to walk, because\n\u201cthe child, in some cases, does not walk when desired, whilst\nyet the circumstances are apparently the same as when he does. For\nhere the unapparent cause of walking, or not walking, is\nwill\u201d (OM 1, prop. 77). But, he adds, \u201ca\ncareful observation \u2026 will always shew \u2026 that when\nchildren do different things, the real circumstances, natural or\nassociated, are proportionally different, and that the state of mind\ncalled will depends on the difference.\u201d\n\nSequences of substitutions transform originally automatic actions into\nvoluntary ones. Hartley recognizes that the process continues, so that\nvoluntary actions in turn become what he terms \u201csecondarily\nautomatic\u201d:\n\nAfter the actions, which are most perfectly voluntary, have been\nrendered so by one set of associations, they may, by another, be made\nto depend upon the most diminutive sensations, ideas, and motions,\nsuch as the mind scarce regards, or is conscious of; and which it can\ntherefore scarce recollect the moment after the action is over. Hence\nit follows, that association not only converts automatic actions into\nvoluntary, but voluntary ones into automatic. For these actions\n\u2026 are rather to be ascribed to the body than the mind, i.e. are\nto be referred to the head of automatic motions. I shall call them\nautomatic motions of the secondary kind, to distinguish them from\nthose which are originally automatic, and from the voluntary ones.\n(OM 1, prop. 21)\n\n\nThink of learning to type or play the piano. At first one develops a\nrepertoire of voluntary motions. But fluency requires that the motions\nbe secondarily automatic.\n\nTo his critics, notably Reid and the later Coleridge, Hartley\u2019s\ncommitment to \u201cmechanism\u201d impeached the \u201cfreedom of\nthe will\u201d and hence moral responsibility. But where such critics\nwere intent on affirming the adult self\u2019s executive control over\nthought and action, Hartley\u2019s concern is the opposite: he starts\nwith the infant and asks, How does a child gain control of the\noriginally automatic processes present in infancy? Gain motor control\nof her hands? Learn to walk, and dance? Play a musical instrument?\nTransform spontaneous burbling and crying into articulate speech?\nHartley\u2019s critics accuse him of reducing the human being to a\n\u201cmere mechanism.\u201d But from a Hartleian perspective, the\n\u201cmechanism\u201d of \u201csecondarily automatic\u201d actions\nis an achievement, not a given\u2014and a necessary achievement, if\none is to live a complete human life.\n\nMost human competencies, though voluntarily performed, rely upon\nextensive repertoires of secondarily automatic actions. Such\nperformances are not prespecified and inflexible routines. When people\nplay music, they add flourishes, and improvise if they are\nsufficiently skilled. When they do so, the actions they perform are\nwhat Hartley calls \u201cdecomplex.\u201d\n\nReaders of the Observations would have been familiar with the\nwords \u201cdecompound\u201d and\n\u201cdecomposite\u201d\u2014both from the late Latin\ndecompositus, a rendering of the Greek\nparasynthetos\u2014in which the \u201cde-\u201d prefix\nsignifies \u201crepeatedly\u201d or \u201cfurther.\u201d They\nwould also know the word \u201ccomplex,\u201d from Locke\u2019s\nEssay concerning Human Understanding: \u201cIdeas thus made\nup of several simple ones put together, I call Complex; such as are\nBeauty, Gratitude, a Man, an Army, the Universe\u201d (Locke [1690]\n1975, 2.12.1).\n\nAvailable to Hartley were both Locke\u2019s distinction between\n\u201csimple\u201d and \u201ccomplex\u201d and also instances in\nwhich the de- prefix meant \u201cfurther.\u201d On the analogy of\n\u201ccompound\u201d to \u201cdecompound,\u201d he wrote of ideas\nand actions being either \u201ccomplex\u201d or\n\u201cdecomplex.\u201d In Hartley\u2019s theory, the associations\nin a complex action or idea are synchronic, while the associations in\na decomplex action or idea are diachronic. In playing a piano, hitting\nthe D key at the sight of the printed note D is a complex movement,\nwhile playing a composition is a decomplex action.\n\nThe elements of a secondarily automatic, complex movement are tightly\nfused. In contrast, those in a decomplex action or idea are more\nloosely associated (OM 1, prop. 12); this looseness makes it\npossible to include a repertoire of secondarily automatic movements in\na variety of decomplex ones\u2014the same notes in an endless number\nof tunes. Hartley also observes that people find it impossible to\nperform decomplex actions\u2014play a tune, say a\nsentence\u2014backward.\n\nDecomplex actions draw on different kinds of complex movements,\ninvolving the association of movements with perceptions in one or more\nsensory modalities: at the sight of the notes on the staff, or the\nsound of the tones, the pianist hits the keys. As a person becomes\nproficient at a type of decomplex action, the guiding sensory modality\ncan change. When learning to dance, Hartley observes, at first\n\u201cthe scholar desires to look at his feet and legs, in order to\njudge by seeing when they are in a proper position,\u201d but\n\u201cby degrees he learns to judge of this by feeling\u201d\n(OM 1, prop. 77). Similarly, a practiced musician plays the\nharpsichord from \u201cthe connexion of the several complex parts of\nthe decomplex motions\u201d (OM 1, prop. 21). One\u2019s\nhands know the tune.\n\nHartley improvised with language in order to articulate a new\nunderstanding of human action. Use of the one word became \u2026\nautomatic. The other never made it into circulation. In a world in\nwhich \u201cdecompose\u201d means \u201cto rot,\u201d it was\ndoomed. Nonetheless, we lack a widely available word for the concept\nthat \u201cdecomplex\u201d names.\n\nHartley\u2019s account draws particular attention to the dependency\nof our capacities for intentionality, flexibility, and innovation in\nour decomplex actions upon the repertoires of actions we have made\nsecondarily automatic. It thus centers upon a key insight: \u201cAll\nour voluntary powers are of the nature of memory\u201d (OM\n1, prop. 90).\n",
