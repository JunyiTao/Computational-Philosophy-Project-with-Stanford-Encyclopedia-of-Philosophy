    "main_text": "Arguments Against Constructive Empiricism || Inference to the Best Explanation\n3.2 Inference to the Best Explanation\n\nInference to the Best Explanation is the controversial rule of\ninference which basically holds that, out of the class of potential\nexplanations we have of some phenomena, we should infer that the best\nexplanation is the true one. If Inference to the Best Explanation is a\nrule we do (or ought) to follow, then it looks as if scientific\nrealism is an accurate description (or prescription) of the aims of\nscience\u2014we should acknowledge the reality of the entities our\nbest explanatory theories postulate, even if those entities are\nunobservable.\n\nThe constructive empiricist might offer several responses to this\nchallenge:\n\nInference to the Best Explanation doesn\u2019t automatically win\nas a description of scientists\u2019 actual inferential practice,\nsince that practice may be equally well described by saying that\nscientists believe our best explanatory theories to be empirically\nadequate (rather than true) (van Fraassen 1980, 20\u201321). Note,\nthough, that the constructive empiricist does not actually endorse the\nrule that we should believe that the best explanation is empirically\nadequate (contrary to how van Fraassen, for instance, has sometimes\nbeen read; see, e.g., Bandyopadhyay 1997).\nThe scientific realist thinks that theories can only adequately\nexplain regularities in nature if we take the theories to be true. But\ntheories can explain if we merely take the theories to be empirically\nadequate. So even if we allow Inference to the Best Explanation as a\nlegitimate rule of inference, the realist has to offer some additional\nreason to think \u201cT is true\u201d is a better explanation than\n\u201cT is empirically adequate\u201d (van Fraassen 1980, 21).\nIt may be that all the potential explanations we have are bad, and\nhence we would be unwise to believe that one of those explanations is\nthe true one (van Fraassen 1989, 143\u2013145). It\u2019s plausible\nto think any argument is mistaken that suggests that we are privileged\nto hit on the right range of potential explanations to begin\nwith.\nAny probabilistic formulation of Inference to the Best Explanation\nis probabilistically incoherent. A Bayesian will coherently update in\nlight of new evidence, but then the proponent of Inference to the Best\nExplanation wants the Bayesian to unwarrantedly give extra\nprobabilistic weight to the hypothesis that is the best explanation\n(van Fraassen 1989, 160\u201370).\n\n\nIn sum, because the constructive empiricist rejects Inference to the\nBest Explanation, she is not moved by arguments for scientific realism\nthat make use of that rule of inference. (See the discussion of\nskepticism about inference to the best explanation in the entry on\n scientific realism\n for an elaboration of doubts about the use of inference to the best\nexplanation as a motivating consideration in favor of scientific\nrealism.)\n",
