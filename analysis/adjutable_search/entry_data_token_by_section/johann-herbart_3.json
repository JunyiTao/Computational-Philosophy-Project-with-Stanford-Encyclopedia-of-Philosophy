    "main_text": "Psychology || Rules of Representations\n3.2 Rules of Representations\nIt is Herbart\u2019s radical contention that consciousness is\nnothing more than the continuous stream of representations.\n[10] \nThese representations, he says cryptically, are the\n\u201cself-preservations of the soul [Selbsterhaltungen der\nSeele]\u201d (PsW: 171). That is, as we saw, because the soul\n(the terms, \u201cpsyche\u201d and \u201csoul\u201d, will be used\ninterchangeably in this article) is postulated to be simple and\n\u201coriginally an utter tabula rasa, without any life or\nthought\u201d (SW VI: 120), the evident multiplicity of conscious\nrepresentations generates a paradox (PsW: 171). Since the soul is by\nnature simple, the source of any psychic differentiation must be\nsought outside of it, viz., among the \u201cobjects\u201d that\naffect it through the senses (PsW: 132).  Thus, on the one hand, the\nworld impinges on and perturbs the soul\u2019s natural placidity\n(cf., e.g., the M\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d\u016bkya\nUpani\u1e63ad; PsW: 132\u20133; but see Felsch 1904: 196\u20137);\non the other hand, the soul resists these disturbances (i.e., the\nrepresentations themselves) by constantly seeking to reestablish a\nharmonious unity or equilibrium among them and thus\n\u201cpreserve\u201d, as far as possible, its own simplicity.\nPsychology\u2019s task, then, is to explain how the various\nrepresentations mutually resolve each other to attain maximal unity\n(Weiss 1928: 73). They do this in two ways. First, wherever there are\nseveral representations of the same kind, they \u201cmerge\u201d\ninto a single representational activity (\u201c\u2026 Ein\nintensives Thun\u201d, PsW: 171; Herbart 1811; Boudewijnse, et\nal. 1999: 170). On the other hand, if representations are of different\nor opposed kinds, they \u201cinhibit\u201d each other\n\u201cquantitatively\u201d (PsW: 129\u201330). Simply put, two\nrepresentations present in consciousness may either resemble each\nother or not. If the former, then they will merge into one, stronger\nrepresentation, and unity will be attained in this way. If they\ndiffer, then they will struggle against each other, each trying to\nnegate the other as far as possible. In the latter case, the\nrepresenting activity remains constant, its essential simplicity\nexpressing itself in each representation\u2019s endeavor to become\nthe sole object of consciousness.\nNow, as they struggle to negate each other, each of the two\nopposing representations is, as Herbart puts it, inhibited\n(gehemmt) by the other (PsW: 130; SW V: 274, f.). We may\nliken his conception of consciousness, then, to a single, general\npsychic activity\u2014call it\n\u201crepresenting\u201d\u2014which, like the surface of a pool in\na rainstorm, is disturbed by multitudinous sensory contact with\nrealia. Each disturbance has the effect of differentiating the\n\u201csurface\u201d; and since that surface just is the\nactivity of representing, each individual ripple takes part in that\nactivity. Which is to say: instead of a general, undifferentiated\nrepresenting activity of pure consciousness, we now have in each\ndisturbance a particular instance of representing, i.e., a\nrepresentation. Just as the ripples caused by two raindrops will\ninterfere and conflict with each other, they nevertheless share a\ncommon substrate\u2014the water\u2014that makes both their\nbeing and conflict possible in the first place: they are\nripples of water. So too each representation, as a ripple of\nconsciousness, shares in the latter\u2019s essence, viz., the\nactivity of representing (here the analogy to water breaks down,\nsince water is not per se an activity). This active nature\nhelps explain why Herbart often seems to suggest that individual\nrepresentations possess their own energy or\nwill[11] to\nsurvive and prevail over others. It is simply a manifestation of\nconsciousness\u2019s own activity and \u201cwill\u201d to maintain\nits essential simplicity, which is why he calls representations\n\u201cself-preservings of the soul\u201d.\nOn Herbart\u2019s view, rather than thinking\nof Vorstellungen as static, image-like things or products of\nan antecedent act of\n representing,[12]\n we should instead think of them as\nindividual conscious activities, i.e., atomic \nrepresent-ings.[13]\n Thus he can speak of the\nrepresentation\u2019s \u201cactivity\u201d persisting even when\nits \u201ceffect\u201d\u2014i.e., my awareness of\nit\u2014\u201cis held back by something alien to it\u201d. Now\nwhen an activity is held back or inhibited from expressing itself, we\ncall it a \u201cstriving\u201d (Streben). Therefore, since\nthe many competing representations striving one against the others\nare all ultimately the self-preservings of one\nconsciousness, one psyche, he groups them all together as\nsingle manifold within the same subject, as \u201cone\nstriving-to-represent [ein Streben, vorzustellen]\u201d\n(PsW: 130; cf. LPs: 370; SW V: 274, f.). Herbart\u2019s theory seems\nto be confirmed by the common experience of our ideas brightening\n(Erhellen: SW V: 279; cf. Boudewijnse, et al. 1999: 170) and\ndimming (Verdunkeln, lit., \u201cdarkening\u201d, PsW:\n130; cf. Boudewijnse, et al. 1999: 170), waning, vanishing, and\nsuddenly returning. But experience does not reveal the laws\naccording to which representations come and go in the mind. How can\nthey be rendered calculable, and thus susceptible to scientific\nunderstanding?\nHerbart proceeds as follows. As we have seen, insofar as\nrepresentations conflict with each other in their struggle to find a\nplace in consciousness, they inhibit\n(hemmen)[14]\n each other; an inhibited representation is\ncorrespondingly dimmed or obscured (verdunkelt); and to the\ndegree that a representation is inhibited from full expression, it is\ntransformed into a striving (Streben) (cf. esp.\nPsW: 133\u20134). Thus, it is reasonable, he argues, to think of the\ninterplay of representations as psychological analogues of physical\nforces (Kr\u00e4fte) (LPs: 369; cf. Boudewijnse, et\nal. 1999: 163; Weiss 1928: 74). When a representation dims, one can\nalso say that it \u201cfalls\u201d or \u201csinks\u201d from\nawareness; when it brightens, that it \u201crises\u201d into\nawareness (Weiss 1928: 75). It is important, however, to note that he\ndoes not say that a representation really is a\n\u201cforce\u201d.[15]\n Rather, several representations in\nopposition behave in force-like\nways.[16] A\nrepresentation, then, expresses force only to the degree to which it\nis inhibited; and it is inhibited by another representation only if\nthe latter is opposed to it in some way. Hence, just as this\nopposition does not belong essentially to either representation, so\ntoo their force-like behavior is only formal and contingent\n(\u201cGradweise\u201d, PsW: 134\u20135; cf. SW V:\n278).\nRepresentations oppose each other by degrees, as we see in the case\nof colors and tones (PsW: 135\u20136). This has important\nimplications.  Since the inhibitions immediately result from\nrepresentations\u2019 mutual opposition, these inhibitions, too, are\ngraduated, as are, consequently, the gradual dimming of the\n(represented) object and the transformation of a representation into a\nstriving-to-represent: all these phenomena are to be thought of as\ngraduated over a spectrum (PsW: 136). In short, the degree of\nopposition among representations sets one of two conditions for a\ndegree of dimming. The second condition is the intensity with which\neach representation initially appears in the psyche. That is,\nrepresentations\n\n\nmay originally be either weaker or stronger, even\nwithout inhibition; we originally ascribe to all of our perceptions a\ncertain degree [of native vivacity]. (SW V: 279)\nIn Herbart\u2019s conception of representations as opposing each\nother by degrees we find the cornerstone of his innovative application\nof mathematics to psychology, and thus of developing a\n\u201cphysics\u201d of mind. He writes: \n\nIf we now connect \u2026 the difference between representations in\nterms of their intensity \n[St\u00e4rke],[17]\n on the one hand, with the magnitude of their\nmutual opposition, on the other, then this yields in each case the\nmagnitude of the resulting dimming, inhibition, [and] striving; and\nso too [the magnitude] of the remaining actual representation. Here\ncalculation [Rechnung] finds its appropriate matter. (PsW:\n136; cf. SW V: 279)\nExtending his mathematical psychology by analogy to the theory of\nmotion, Herbart complements his psychic statics (PsW: 139), or\ndoctrine of representational equilibrium, with a psychic mechanics\n(PsW: 208), or doctrine of movement of these \u201cmental\nbodies\u201d over time (PsW: 137; cf. Boudewijnse, et al. 1999:\n163). It is to these that we now turn.\n",
