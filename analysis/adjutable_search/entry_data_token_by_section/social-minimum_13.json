    "main_text": "What can be said against the enactment of a social minimum? || The fairness objection\n3.2 The fairness objection\n\nA different objection focuses on the alleged risk of unfairness in\nenacting a social minimum. Specifically, the unfairness\nobjection is that public provision of a social minimum might lead\nsome people to make inadequate effort to help themselves and that this\nis unfair to those whose efforts ultimately make the necessary\nresources available. Note that the behavior allegedly caused by social\nminimum programs might also or alternatively be considered a bad thing\nbecause of its effect on the benefit recipient, rather than (just)\nbecause of any unfairness to others. This thought motivates what one\nmight call the dependency objection to enactment of a social\nminimum, in view of the alleged passivity or \u201cdependency\u201d\ninduced by reliance on welfare benefits (see, for example, Tocqueville\n1835, Murray 1984; see also Humboldt 1852). However, a good deal of\nwhat can be said in reply to the fairness objection also applies to\nthis dependency objection, and so we will not lose much by focusing\njust on the fairness objection for present purposes.\n\nLet\u2019s start by stating the fairness objection more precisely. One\nversion of the objection appeals to a principle of\nreciprocity. This says that if one willingly shares in the\nbenefits created through the efforts of others in society, notably\nthrough their work, then one has an obligation to reciprocate by\nmaking a contribution to producing these benefits oneself, as long as\none has the capacity and opportunity to do so (White 2003). The idea\nis not necessarily that you should produce in strict proportion to\nwhat you consume, but that one should try to \u2018do one\u2019s bit\u2019,\nunderstanding society as a cooperative scheme to which all should\ncontribute if they are able. Given this principle, the fairness\nobjection to enacting a social minimum is that this could somehow lead\nto some people enjoying goods and services without satisfying their\nreciprocity-based obligation to work. To prevent this, the argument\ngoes, we should not enact a social minimum.\n\nAs just stated, however, it seems like there is another obvious\nresponse to the fairness objection. Rather than not enacting a social\nminimum, we could instead enact a social minimum but include in the\nrules of the social minimum policy regime a work- or\ncontribution-related condition. For example, if one claims cash\nbenefits to assist with low income then eligibility for the benefits\ncan be made conditional on work-related activity. We might call this,\nthe principle of work-conditionality (for apparent\nendorsements of this principle, subject to widely varying degrees of\nqualification, see Anderson 1999: 321; Gutmann and Thompson 1996:\nchapter 8; Mead 1986, 1992, 1997; Rawls 2001: 179; White 2000, 2003,\n2005). To be clear, by work-conditionality we mean conditions that\nlink elements of the social minimum policy regime to some kind of\nemployment-related activity, such as active job search or retraining,\nnot necessarily to work itself. (\u2018Work\u2019 is, moreover, a broader\nconcept than \u2018employment\u2019, a point we shall return to below.)\n\nThis response to the fairness objection itself raises an important\nethical question. Should the social minimum be enacted in a way that\nreflects the principle of work-conditionality? Space permits us here\nto consider just two of the more important sets of arguments against\nthe principle of work-conditionality (for further, empirically\ninformed discussions, see Watts and Fitzpatrick 2018, Dwyer 2019,\nEleveld, Kampen and Arts 2020).\n3.2.1 Vulnerability, equity, and the relevance of background injustice\n\nA first important set of arguments against work-conditionality appeals\nto problems of vulnerability and equity in the application of\nwork conditions in a social minimum policy regime, and, under\nnon-ideal conditions, to the importance of considering the\nsignificance of background injustice.\n\nOne possible problem concerns vulnerability in the labor\nmarket. As we saw above in section\n 2.5,\n one rationale for having a welfare state to enact a social minimum is\nthat, by providing access to urgently needed goods independently of\nthe sale of labor-power, it can reduce the pressure on disadvantaged\nworkers to scramble into poor quality (exploitative or abusive) jobs.\nThere is a danger that work-conditionality rules undermine this\ndesirable effect. If, for example, the government tells an unemployed\nperson that they must look for a job and take any job offered by an\nemployer on whatever terms this employer states, or else lose all\nwelfare benefits, then this person will be under severe pressure to\nfind and take a job. They will clearly have much less power to refuse\njobs that involve exploitative or abusive treatment than if they\nreceived welfare benefits unconditionally. According to some critics,\nthis is the whole point of work-conditionality: to weaken the\nbargaining position of labor in the interests of business and the\nproperty-owning classes (see Piven and Cloward 1993). A distinct but\nrelated objection is that work-conditionality might place a burden of\n\u201cshameful revelation\u201d on those claiming transfers: to\nqualify for transfers, they have to show that they have looked for a\njob, but failed to get one, which is potentially damaging to\nself-respect (Wolff 1998).\n\nA second problem concerns the vulnerability of dependents. If\nsomeone is denied the full social minimum because they choose not to\nsatisfy a work-conditionality rule then this will not only hurt them,\nbut is likely also to hurt others who depend on them for an income\nsuch as their children (if they have children). Since these children\nare in no way responsible for their parents\u2019 decision to ignore\na work-conditionality rule, this hurt is surely unfair (and may\nundermine other social goals, such as achieving equality of\neducational opportunity for children from different social\nbackgrounds).\n\nA third problem is that work-conditionality rules may in practice lead\nto inequity between welfare recipients and other citizens.\nFor example, what about those who inherit large amounts of wealth?\nWhat can be done to get these wealthier citizens to meet their\nreciprocity-based obligation to work? If nothing is done, then there\nis apparently a failure to enforce a given social obligation equitably:\ncitizens who need welfare benefits will be forced to meet their\nobligation to work, but citizens who receive large inheritances will\nnot be forced to meet this obligation. There is also a danger of\ninequity in the treatment of different kinds of work. If we\nthink here of \u2018work\u2019 only as employment or market-facing work we will\nignore the non-market care work that many do for children and other\nfamily members and friends. Arguably, at least some of this work also\ncounts in satisfaction of the reciprocity-based obligation to \u2018do\none\u2019s bit\u2019 in society, and so there is an injustice if those doing\nthis work \u2013 in most real-world societies, these people will be\ndisproportionately women \u2013 are required also to do as much employment,\nmarket-facing work as others.\n\nAll of these points connect in turn to a basic, underlying question of\nhow just are the society\u2019s background economic structures. If\nsociety\u2019s economic structures are just in other respects, then it may\nseem reasonable to expect each citizen who is able to work to do so.\nIn a context of otherwise just social arrangements, then this seems\npart and parcel of fair social cooperation. But what if the background\nstructures of the economy are actually unjust in other respects? For\nexample, perhaps society\u2019s educational institutions fail to secure\nsufficient equality of opportunity, unfairly leaving some citizens\nwith limited job opportunities. Or perhaps the reward structure is\nunequal to an unfair extent, leaving some workers with unfairly low\npay for the work they do. In this context, it can be argued that the\nunderlying obligation to work, as an expression of fairness in social\ncooperation, does not in fact hold for those citizens who suffer\nunfair disadvantage. This point is made by Tommie Shelby in his\ndiscussion of the obligations of the Black ghetto poor in the USA:\n\n\u2026job opportunities for low-skilled workers are severely\nlimited and the jobs that are available are often menial, dead-end\nservice positions that pay wages too low to provide adequate economic\nsecurity for a family. Now it might be replied that if the ghetto poor\ndo not want to take these low-wage jobs they should develop their\nskills\u2026.As is widely known, however, the quality of education\navailable to ghetto residents is generally so substandard that most\ncannot get a basic education there, let alone proper preparation for\ncollege\u2026.This lack of equal educational opportunity, which in\nturn creates an unfair employment opportunity scheme, vitiates any\nobligation to work\u2026 (Shelby 2007, 146\u2013147; see also\nShelby 2016, chapter 6.)\n\nThe putative, reciprocity-based obligation to work does not exist for\nthose who are unjustly disadvantaged in the way described; hence,\nthere can be no question of justice requiring enforcement of this\nsupposed obligation. In addition, any attempt to enforce the\nnon-existent obligation is likely to make the unjust disadvantage\nworse, for example, in the contemporary US context, by reinforcing\ndegrading historical conceptions of Black people as people whom it is\nappropriate to force to work (see Shelby 2016, 197\u2013200).\n\nTaking these points on board, even some of those who have endorsed the\nprinciple of reciprocity and the basic idea of work-conditionality\nhave also cautioned against applying work-conditionality in a way that\nis insensitive to the background distribution of wealth and\nopportunity in society (see, for example, Gutmann and Thompson 1996:\nchapter 8; White 2003, 2005; see also Daniels 1981: 160\u2013162).\nThey argue that the principle of work-conditionality should be\nsuspended, or at least moderated, if the background distribution of\nwealth and opportunity is not sufficiently just. Indeed, given the\nrisks involved, and the complexity of creating the conditions for the\nfair enforcement of work obligations, there is a case for avoiding\nwork-conditionality altogether even if one accepts the underlying\nprinciple of reciprocity (White 2017).\n3.2.2 The inheritance argument against conditionality\n\nA further objection to making the social minimum work-conditional\ncomes from philosophers influenced by the left-libertarian tradition\nreviewed above (see section\n 2.3).\n As we saw above, left-libertarians believe that, ideally speaking,\nindividuals have a right to an equal share of resources that are an\ninheritance from nature or from past generations. Thus, imagine that\nten people arrive on an island and find that it contains a factory\ncontaining ten machines. The machines can be used to produce the food,\nclothing and shelter that the islanders need to survive. The\nleft-libertarian will argue that in principle each islander should\nreceive one machine\u2014that is, an equal share of the machines in\nthe inherited factory. Now suppose that one of the ten islanders, call\nthem Drew, decides not to work their machine but to rent it out to\nother islanders who are prepared to work it for a price. Drew does no\nwork, but simply lives off the rent that other islanders pay them for\nthe use of the machine that they have been allocated. Now, depending\non how high the rent is, Drew could conceivably be receiving an income\nclose to their society\u2019s social minimum, and they will be doing no\nwork in return for this income. But the left-libertarian will argue\nthat this is not unjust because Drew is only here making use of their\nrightful share of society\u2019s inherited goods. As we noted above, it is\ndifficult in practice to divide inherited resources up literally in\nthis way. But we can perhaps identify these resources, assess their\nmarket value, and give everyone a grant of income or wealth equivalent\nto a per capita share of the market value of these resources. Some\npeople might choose to live off this grant without doing any work (or\ndoing as little work as possible). But, according to the\nleft-libertarian, this is no different to Drew deciding to do no work\nand to live off the rent they can get from charging others to work on\ntheir machine: it is a legitimate use of one\u2019s rightful share of\nsociety\u2019s inherited resources. Subject to important nuances and\nvariations, a number of philosophers have employed this type of\nargument in recent years to defend the payment to each citizen of a\nuniversal basic income or a universal capital grant\n(see Steiner 1994; Van Parijs 1992, 1995; Ackerman and Alstott 1999;\nDworkin 2000; Birnbaum 2012; Widerquist 2013; Bidadanure 2019).\n\nThere are, however, some difficulties with the argument, understood as\nan attempt to defend the enactment of a full social minimum without\nany work condition.\n\nThe first difficulty, already flagged up in our discussion of\nleft-libertarianism in section\n 2.3,\n is that the grant which represents one\u2019s rightful share of society\u2019s\ninherited wealth might fall somewhat short of the value of the full\nsocial\n minimum.[8]\n\nHowever, a second issue is whether people do in fact have a right to\nan equal share of their society\u2019s inherited resources regardless\nof work effort. The basic issue is whether it is fair to use an\ninheritance, as Chris does in the example above, to extract a share of\nwhat other citizens produce while choosing not to make a productive\ncontribution of one\u2019s own in return.\n\nIt might be said that people like Drew do contribute to production \u2013\nthey do so by supplying their share of inherited resources for others\nto use for productive purposes. But a distinction can be made between\nthe contribution that the inherited resources putatively credited to\nDrew make to production, and Drew\u2019s own contribution. If Drew were not\non the island we imagined, the other islanders could still use the\ninherited resources that we have supposed are otherwise credited to\nDrew. They could work just as hard, and produce just as much, as they\ndo when Drew is there and is credited with an equal share of these\nresources. But they would be better off because they would not have to\ngive a portion of this product to Drew in return for using some of the\nisland\u2019s inherited wealth. This, so the argument runs, shows that Drew\nthemselves is not in any real sense contributing economically to the\nsociety. So is it fair for Drew to get an income without working\n(assuming that they could if they so choose)? Some argue that Drew has\nas much right to a share of the machines as anyone else and it is up\nto them what benefit they get from this (Van Parijs 1995, drawing on\nDworkin 1985, 2000; Birnbaum 2012). Others argue that cases like this\nshow that a just distribution of assets should be more sensitive to\nindividuals\u2019 own interest in making direct use of the assets (see van\nDonselaar 2009; see also Van der Veen 1998, White 2007).\n\nTo conclude, the concern for economic fairness (as reciprocity) does\nnot offer grounds for rejecting enactment of a social minimum. At\nmost, it supports making elements of a social minimum policy package\nwork-conditional. However, there are strong arguments for limiting\nwork-conditionality. One set of arguments appeals to the ways in which\nwork-conditionality can enhance the vulnerability of citizens to\nexploitation or other forms of injustice and/or generate or exacerbate\nother inequities between citizens. This set of arguments has\nadditional force in societies where background economic structures are\notherwise significantly unjust (Shelby 2007, 2016, White 2017).\nAnother kind of argument appeals to the idea that citizens have a\nright to a share of inherited assets that is not conditional with\nrespect to willingness to work, though the scope and precise nature of\nthis right remains disputed.\n3.3 The legitimacy objection\n\nA third objection to the enactment of a social minimum appeals to the\nvalue of legitimacy. A law or policy lacks legitimacy when the law or\npolicy is arbitrary in the eyes of those bound by the law or\npolicy\u2014that is, they are not given a sufficiently good and\naccessible reason to justify their subjection to this law or policy.\nThe absence of legitimacy signals a kind of alienation from the law or\npolicy, so that people are unable to identify with it as an expression\nof what they value and believe. Critics might argue that the\nestablishment of a social minimum policy regime creates distinctive\nproblems of legitimacy for a society; and they might further argue\nthat these problems make it undesirable, all things considered, to\nenact a social minimum. How might enactment of a social minimum\ngenerate problems of legitimacy? How can these problems be tackled? Do\nthe problems really discredit the case for enactment?\n\nOne potential legitimacy problem is the capability-list\nproblem that we noted above in section\n 1.2.\n To say what kind and level of resources are necessary for people to\nbe able to lead \u201ca minimally decent life in one\u2019s\nsociety\u201d, we must take a view about the functionings and\ncapabilities that are constitutive of a decent human life, and any\nsuch view is bound to be somewhat controversial, perhaps especially if\nwe are trying to define a social minimum transnationally or globally.\nSome people might not accept the capability-list used to determine the\nsocial minimum as the right list. We shall return briefly to this\nproblem towards the end of this section, but only after first give\nsome consideration to a second potential legitimacy problem which we\nalso briefly noted in section\n 1.1:\n the limit-setting problem. To recall the problem, consider\nonce again item (2) on Nussbaum\u2019s list of \u201ccentral human\nfunctional capabilities\u201d, as set out in section\n 1.2,\n the capability for bodily health. What kind and level of access to\nhealth-care resources must a society secure for its members for us to\nsay that this capability is satisfied to an extent that allows\neveryone to lead \u201ca minimally decent life\u201d? If we hold\nthat a society must ensure access to whatever health-care resources\nhave, say, a life-sustaining impact, then we may well be committing\nourselves to spending the vast bulk of a society\u2019s resources just on\nhealth-care. At some point limits must be set, or else the health-care\nsector will devour the whole social product (making it impossible, of\ncourse, to provide for other key capabilities). But, on the other\nhand, how can limits be set in a way that is fair and has legitimacy\nin the eyes of the people who will have to live with the consequences\nof these limit-setting decisions? How is it possible for communities\nto decide whether or not a new, expensive health-care treatment is in\nor out of the social minimum, and for this decision to have legitimacy\nin the eyes of the citizens?\n\nThese questions invite us to consider explicitly the political\nprocesses through which limit-setting (and other) decisions are\nmade. It considers what features these processes must have if they are\nto treat all those bound by the decisions fairly, and in a way that\nall those concerned can regard as legitimate.\n\nIn the health-care context, the issue of limit-setting is explored in\nan important paper by Norman Daniels and James Sabin (Daniels and\nSabin 1997). Daniels and Sabin argue that for limit-setting decisions\nin this context to have legitimacy, the decision-making process must\nsatisfy four conditions (see Daniels and Sabin 1997: 322\u2013325;\nalso Ham and Robert 2003: 2):\n\nPublicity. The rationales for limit-setting decisions\nmust be made public.\nReasonableness. The rationales for limit-setting\ndecisions should be reasonable; that is, they should appeal to reasons\nand principles that can be accepted as relevant by people who are\ndisposed to look for reasons and principles agreeable to all.\nContestability. There should be a mechanism through which\ndecisions can be challenged, with adequate opportunity to present new\narguments and evidence.\nEnforcement. There should be a mechanism for forcing the\nlimit-setting body to respect the first three conditions.\n\n\nThe idea is not that the people who are affected by a given\nlimit-setting decision will necessarily agree with this decision if\nthese conditions are met, e.g., agree with a decision to exclude a\nspecific medical treatment from the health-care package provided under\nthe social minimum policy regime. Rather, the idea is that all parties\nwill be able to regard the decision as legitimate, even if they\ndisagree with it and some of them continue to oppose it. The\nconditions of publicity and reasonableness work to ensure that a given\ndecision is grounded in reasons of a kind that affected parties can\nsee at least see as relevant. The contestability condition helps to\nensure that the reasonableness of the decision is robust, that all\nrelevant reasons and evidence have indeed been weighed by the\ndecision-making body in coming to its decision. In these\ncircumstances, even the person who \u201closes\u201d in such a case\ncan feel assured that their interests and point of view have not been\noverruled arbitrarily. In this sense, they are fairly treated and the\ndecision ought to have, even in their eyes, legitimacy, even if they\ncontinue to think it mistaken and oppose it.\n\nThe implication of the foregoing analysis is that those who wish to\nenact a social minimum need to give serious thought to the\ninstitutional structures through which limit-setting decisions are\nmade, with an eye to seeing that the conditions of publicity,\nreasonableness, contestability, and enforcement are met. This applies\nnot only in relation to health-care, but in relation to all the\nprograms that governments must typically have as part of enacting a\nsocial minimum, such as cash transfer programs, educational services,\nand so on.\n\nMoreover, this concern for appropriate procedure should arguably\ninform not only our response to the limit-setting problem, but to the\ncapability-list problem that we noted above. In a society where there\nis broad, but not perfect, consensus in support of a Nussbaum-style\nlist of \u201ccentral human functional capabilities\u201d, the\nlegitimacy of the final capability-list used to help specify the\nsocial minimum can be enhanced by subjecting the formulation of the\nlist to a process that has the characteristics of publicity,\nreasonableness, and contestability noted above (see Sen 1999: 110;\nNussbaum 1999: 47\u201349, for comments along these\n lines).[9]\n A similar focus on the importance of fair procedure in the\nspecification of the social minimum policy package can be found in\nNancy Fraser\u2019s work on the \u201cpolitics of need\ninterpretation\u201d (Fraser 1989, 1997), and in Amy Gutmann\u2019s and\nDennis Thompson\u2019s account of welfare state policy-making in a\n\u201cdeliberative democracy\u201d (Gutmann and Thompson 1996). The\nuse of conditionality, discussed in the previous section, is perhaps a\nparticularly important area in which to make sure that policy-making\nprocedures have these qualities of publicity, reasonableness, and\ncontestability. In societies where there is significant background\ninjustice, it will be very important also to ensure adequate voice in\nthe decision-making process for those who suffer unjust\ndisadvantage.\n\nA further and key question for consideration here is whether the\nstandard processes of representative democracy are adequate to meet\nthe demands of publicity, reasonableness, and contestability, or\nwhether, to achieve decisions that have legitimacy, these processes\nneed to be supplemented by other kinds of institutions that are more\ndeliberative and inclusive of the people who stand to be bound by\nlimit-setting, capability-listing, and conditionality-defining\ndecisions. Interesting developments in this respect include:\n\n(1) use of citizens\u2019 juries, deliberative opinion\npolls and Citizens\u2019 Assemblies to assist with\ndecision-making (on which, see Fishkin 1995, Coote and Lenaghan 1998,\nSmith and Wales 2000, Fung 2003, Smith 2009);\n\n(2) Participatory Budgeting, which originated in Brazil in\nthe 1990s and has since been taken up (in various forms) around the\nworld (de Sousa Santos 2007, Wampler 2007, Baiocchi, Heller and Silva\n2011, Fung 2011); and,\n\n(3) village parliaments (gram sabhas) that are\nconstitutionally mandated in rural areas in India and which have\nhelped to empower poorer citizens to exercise more control over\nprovision of local public goods (V\u00e9ron 2001, Parthasarathy and\nRao 2018, Parthasarathy, Rao and Palaniswamy 2019).\n\nIn view of the legitimacy problems discussed in this section, those\nwho support enactment of a social minimum should consider the\ncontribution of these and similar institutions in the specification\nand operation of social minimum policy regimes.\n4. Conclusion\n\nInstead of summarizing the arguments of the previous sections here, we\nclose by noting three further points which put our discussion into\nperspective.\n\nFirstly, we should note that as we move to enact the social minimum\nthere are a number of important policy design questions that arise\nthat our discussion thus far leaves unresolved. We have considered one\ndesign issue: the issue of how far access to the social minimum should\nbe work-conditional. But there is a huge range of other design issues\nthat we have not directly considered. For example, if we accept that\nthe government has a responsibility to its citizens to secure access\nto certain basic goods and services, to what extent should the\ngovernment itself directly produce these goods and services, e.g.,\nhealth-care? If we accept that the government must introduce\ntax-transfer schemes to enact the social minimum, what form should\nthese take? Should the government use \u201cmeans-testing\u201d to\ntarget transfers exclusively to the most needy, or should it seek to\nenact the social minimum through so-called \u201csocial\ninsurance\u201d programs to which all (or virtually all) citizens\ncontribute, and from which all receive\n benefits?[10]\n If the government provides citizens with assistance in meeting a\nspecific need, should it provide assistance in the form of\n\u201cin-kind\u201d benefits or in the form of\n cash?[11]\n These are all major design questions that arise in thinking about how\nto enact the social minimum. One cannot settle them merely by appeal\nto the basic idea of the social minimum. Although many of the ideas\nand considerations discussed here will be relevant in addressing these\nquestions, settling them requires further philosophical reflection\nand, indeed, a lot of empirical research.\n\nSecondly, it is important to emphasise again that much of our\ndiscussion has taken the scope of the social minimum to be that of a\nnation state, but we can and should also consider obligations to enact\na social minimum at transnational and global levels. A full discussion\nof this would need to draw on the growing body of literature on global\n justice.[12]\n\nThirdly, even when considering economic and social arrangements within\na given nation, we need to keep distinct the specific question of\nwhether and why a social minimum is justified from the broader\nquestion of what social justice consists in and demands of us.\nEnacting a social minimum may well be a demand of social justice.\nIndeed, it may well be one of the most urgent demands of social\njustice. But, challenging as this demand is, social justice might\nrequire much more of us than this.",
