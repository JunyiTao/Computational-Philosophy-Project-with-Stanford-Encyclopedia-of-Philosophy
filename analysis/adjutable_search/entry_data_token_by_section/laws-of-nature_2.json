    "main_text": "Universals\n3. Universals\n\nIn the late 1970s, there emerged a competitor for the systems approach\nand all other Humean attempts to say what it is to be a law. Led by\nArmstrong (1978, 1983, 1991, 1993), Dretske (1977), and Tooley (1977,\n1987), the rival approach appeals to universals (i.e., certain kinds\nof properties and relations) to distinguish laws from nonlaws.\n\nFocusing on Armstrong\u2019s development of the view, here is a\nconcise statement of the framework characteristic of the\nuniversals approach:\n\nSuppose it to be a law that Fs are Gs.\nF-ness and G-ness are taken to be universals. A\ncertain relation, a relation of non-logical or contingent\nnecessitation, holds between F-ness and G-ness. This\nstate of affairs may be symbolized as\n\u2018N(F,G)\u2019 (1983, 85).\n\n\nThis framework promises to address familiar puzzles and problems:\nMaybe the difference between the uranium-spheres generalization and\nthe gold-spheres generalization is that being uranium does necessitate\nbeing less than one mile in diameter, but being gold does not. Worries\nabout the subjective nature of simplicity, strength and best balance\ndo not emerge; there is no threat of lawhood being mind-dependent so\nlong as necessitation is not mind-dependent. Some think that the\nframework supports the idea that laws play a special explanatory role\nin inductive inferences, since a law is not just a universal\ngeneralization, but is an entirely different creature \u2014 a\nrelation holding between two other universals (Armstrong 1991, Dretske\n1977). The framework is also consistent with lawhood not supervening\non local matters of particular fact; the denial of Humean\nsupervenience often accompanies acceptance of the universals\napproach.\n\nFor there truly to be this payoff, however, more has to be said about\nwhat N is. This is a problem van Fraassen calls the\nidentification problem, which he couples this with a second\nproblem, what he calls the inference problem (1989, 96). The\nessence of this pair of problems was captured early on by Lewis with\nhis usual flair:\n\nWhatever N may be, I cannot see how it could be absolutely\nimpossible to have N(F,G) and Fa\nwithout Ga. (Unless N just is constant conjunction,\nor constant conjunction plus something else, in which case\nArmstrong\u2019s theory turns into a form of the regularity theory he\nrejects.) The mystery is somewhat hidden by Armstrong\u2019s\nterminology. He uses \u2018necessitates\u2019 as a name for the\nlawmaking universal N; and who would be surprised to hear\nthat if F \u2018necessitates\u2019 G and\na has F, then a must have G? But I\nsay that N deserves the name of \u2018necessitation\u2019\nonly if, somehow, it really can enter into the requisite necessary\nconnections. It can\u2019t enter into them just by bearing a name,\nany more than one can have mighty biceps just by being called\n\u2018Armstrong\u2019 (1983, 366).\n\n\nBasically, there needs to be a specification of what the lawmaking\nrelation is (the identification problem). Then, there needs to be a\ndetermination of whether it is suited to the task (the inference\nproblem): Does N\u2019s holding between F and\nG entail that Fs are Gs? Does its holding\nsupport corresponding counterfactuals? Do laws really turn out not to\nsupervene, to be mind-independent, to be explanatory? Armstrong does\nsay more about what his lawmaking relation is. He states in reply to\nvan Fraassen:\n\nIt is at this point that, I claim, the Identification problem has been\nsolved. The required relation is the causal relation, \u2026 now\nhypothesized to relate types not tokens (1993, 422).\n\n\nQuestions remain about the nature of this causal relation understood\nas a relation that relates both token events and universals.
