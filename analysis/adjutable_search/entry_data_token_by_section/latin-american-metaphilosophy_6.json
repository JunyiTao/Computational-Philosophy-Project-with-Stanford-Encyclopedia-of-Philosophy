    "main_text": "What Is Latin American Philosophy? || Middle-Way Theories\n2.3 Middle-Way Theories\n\nMiddle-way theories reject both strong universalism and strong\ndistinctivism. If successful, they would avoid the problems facing\neach of those extremes\u2014which, as we saw above, are skepticism\nabout Latin American philosophy (in strong universalism) and\nungrounded assumptions (in strong distinctivism). Here we\u2019ll\nbriefly consider three recent middle-way positions. The first two\nagree that it would be possible to provide examples of sufficient\nconditions for a work to count as Latin American philosophy. The\nposition discussed last undertakes the more ambitious project of\nproposing a set of conditions that are necessary and jointly\nsufficient.\n\n2.3.1 Gracia\u2019s Ethnic-Philosophy Account\n\nWhat we may call \u2018the ethnic-philosophy account\u2019\n(Gracia\u2019s 2003, 2008) is a neo-Wittgensteinian view holding that\nLatin American philosophy (and more broadly, Hispanic and Latino/a\nphilosophy) is\n\n[T]he philosophy of an ethnos, and insofar as it is so, and members of\nethne do not necessarily share features in common, then what the\nphilosophy of a particular ethnos is exactly will not require any\nfeatures in common with other philosophies outside the ethnos or even\nwithin the ethnos throughout its history. This, I claim, is the best\nway of understanding the unity of Latin American philosophy. (Gracia\n2008, p. 140)\n\n\nOn this account, being the philosophy of the Latin American ethnos is\nsufficient for counting as Latin American philosophy. At the same\ntime, the account holds that it is not possible to provide conditions\nthat are necessary and jointly sufficient for being an\ninstance of this ethnic philosophy. No such conditions are to be had,\neven in the case of \u2018Spanish philosophy,\u2019 another ethnic\nphilosophy for which no necessary and sufficient conditions of\ninclusion can be offered, even though it appears identifiable in\nnationality terms\u2014a conclusion suggested by the fact that\n\u2018Spanish philosophy\u2019 commonly includes figures such as\n\u201cSeneca and Averroes, philosophers who lived long before the\nSpanish nation was constituted as a political reality, and whose\nrelationship to this nation, as we have known it since the sixteenth\ncentury, is less than tenuous\u201d (Gracia 2003, p. 57).\n\nThis conception of Latin American philosophy as an ethnic philosophy\nis inspired by Wittgenstein\u2019s \u2018family resemblances\u2019\ntheory for concepts such as \u2018game\u2019 and\n\u2018funny.\u2019 For example, there is no distinguishing feature\nthat all games have in common in virtue of which they are games.\nRather, there are resemblances between activities we call\n\u2018games\u2019 that are like the resemblances between members of\na single family. Similarly, there are no distinguishing properties of\nan ethnic philosophy but numerous properties that would each be a\nsufficient condition for belonging to it. This seems to entail that\nthat an ethnic philosophy can be categorized in a variety of ways,\ngiven that its identity hinges at least in part on the adopted\n\u201cselective point of view\u201d with regard to its properties.\nSome cases illustrating the claim come readily to mind. Consider\nPicasso\u2019s works. They may be legitimately categorized as French\nunder one selective point of view, and as Spanish under another. Thus,\nwhether they fall under one or the other is at least in part\ncontingent upon a selective point of view (Gracia 2003, p. 65).\nLikewise, it is possible that certain philosophical works belong to\nLatin American philosophy under one selective point of view, but not\nunder another. Thus, whether Latin American philosophy turns out to be\nthin or robust would then itself be contingent, at least in part, upon\nwhich selective point of view one were to adopt. In short,\nsince the concept \u2018Latin American philosophy\u2019 is\nrelevantly analogous to concepts such as \u2018game\u2019 or\n\u2018funny,\u2019 there are no necessary and sufficient conditions\nfor individuating Latin American philosophy; but a variety of\nselective criteria are possible. Each such criterion would be\nlegitimate, provided that it captured a contextually determined,\nsufficient condition for being an instance of Latin American\nphilosophy. Here is how the ethnic-philosophy theorist spells out his\nview on this matter\n\nIn a context in which all texts are in English and have American\nauthors except for one, who is Uruguayan, the origin of the author\ncould be sufficient to identify the text as belonging to Latin\nAmerican philosophy. In a situation in which we have a series of Latin\ntexts published in Spain, but one of which was written by an author\nwho spent the greatest part of his life in Mexico, we could identify\nthis text as Latin American. (Gracia 2003, p. 64)\n\n\nOne of the advantages of this account is its flexibility. For it\nentails that Latin American philosophy can accommodate whatever works\nmeet an appropriate contextually determined condition, whether they be\nnonstandard works such as those of las Casas and Gutti\u00e9rrez, or\nmainstream ones such as those of Newton da Costa or C. Ulises Moulines\n(more on this below). The account is also capable of accommodating the\nfact that some works seem characteristically Latin American while\nothers have a universal import. Furthermore, it allows one to\nclassify, e.g., Kant\u2019s categorical imperative as German\nphilosophy in a context where an author\u2019s place of origin is\nrelevant, and as universal deontology in a context where birthplace is\nnot relevant.\n\nThe main challenge for this view is how to avoid an anything-goes form\nof metaphilosophical relativism. Gracia (2003, p. 66) has sought to\neliminate this threat by emphasizing that it is not only a\ncontextually determined, selective point of view that matters for\nindividuating ethnic philosophies. Reality also has a role, possibly\nin connection with history, which Gracia invokes to explain the nature\nof \u201cphilosophical texts.\u201d On his view, these are\n\u201chistorical entities, the product of historical beings in\nparticular times and places whose identities are linked to the context\nin which they were produced and which, for that reason, depend on\nthem\u201d (2003, p. 65). Metaphilosophical relativists can, however,\nwelcome this appeal to history, though they would further insist that\nit is not only philosophical texts but also the truth of philosophical\ntheories that\u2019s similarly contingent upon historical context. In\nfact, more than a mere logical possibility, relativism of this sort is\nby now a strong twentieth century tradition in the philosophy of\nscience (see, e.g., Kuhn 1962, especially chapter 10).\n\n2.3.2 Moulines\u2019s Compromise Account\n\nAlso a middle way between universalism and distinctivism is\nMoulines\u2019s 2010 position. Like Gracia\u2019s account, it\nvindicates only sufficient conditions for being an instance of Latin\nAmerican philosophy. But unlike Gracia\u2019s account,\nMoulines\u2019s does not argue against the possibility of conditions\nthat are both necessary and jointly sufficient. His positive proposal\nconsists of four sufficient conditions that, on his view, a number of\nrecent works meet\u2014namely, they are universal in the sense that\nthey use concepts and provide arguments that are intended to be\nuniversally valid; (2) they have been developed by Latin American\nauthors; (3) they have been originally devised, at least partially, in\nsome Latin American countries; and (4) they have found widespread\ninterest both in and outside Latin America.\n\nSatisfying (1) through (4) is considered sufficient for a work to be\n\u201can instantiation of \u2018Latin American\nphilosophy\u2019\u201d (Moulines 2010, p. 460). Moulines\u2019s\nsample of such instances includes several brands of theories and/or\nmethods developed by contemporary Latin American philosophers such as\nparaconsistent logic (by Brazilian Newton da Costa and his\ncollaborators), formal deontic logic (by Argentinean Carlos\nAlchourr\u00f3n and Eugenio Bulygin), belief revision (in part by\nAlchourr\u00f3n), scientific realism (by Argentinean Mario Bunge), a\nhistorical approach to the foundations of physics (by Chilean Roberto\nTorreti), and structuralist theory of science (by Venezuelan Moulines\nand his collaborators).\n\nAccording to Moulines, conditions (1) through (4) express an\nunderstanding of Latin American philosophy that is\n\u201c\u2018universalist\u2019 as much as\n\u2018distinctivist\u2019\u201d (2010, p. 460). A quick look at\nthem suggests that (1) is relevant to universalism, (2) and (3) to\ndistinctivism, and (4) to neither because it is neutral, though it\nbears on the external invisibility problem mentioned above. But note\nthat(2) and (3) are distinctivist only in terms of\n\u2018peculiarity\u2019\u2014which, as pointed out earlier, is the\ncheapest of the distinctive properties at issue on this debate.\n\n2.3.3 Nuccetelli\u2019s Applied-Philosophy Account\n\nAnother mid-way position to be considered here was developed in\nNuccetelli 2002 and 2009. It proposes a set of conditions that are\ntaken to be both necessary and jointly sufficient for being an\ninstance of a characteristically Latin American\nphilosophy\u2014namely, that any qualifying work must\n\nContain philosophical arguments or methods that are sufficiently\noriginal, and\nBe sensitive to a Latin America context.\n\n\nAny work satisfying (1) and (2) would count as characteristically\nLatin American in Nuccetelli\u2019s sense. She further contends that\nthere is a robust body of philosophical work in Latin America that\nsatisfies these conditions. It is mostly devoted to issues of moral,\nsocial, and political philosophy and includes the works of both,\nnon-academic and academic philosophers. Thus construed, Latin American\nphilosophy comes out as a branch of applied philosophy and its\nexistence is consistent with that of universal philosophy\u2014which\nis grounded in a variety of traditions of Western philosophy and\ndevoted to problems that have universal import such as knowledge and\nskepticism, the nature of consciousness, moral reasoning, and the\nexistence and attributes of God. A Latin American philosopher may\ncultivate either universal philosophy or some branch of applied\nphilosophy, including Latin American philosophy. From the time of the\nFounders to the present, there has been a long list of those who in\nfact did both.\n",
