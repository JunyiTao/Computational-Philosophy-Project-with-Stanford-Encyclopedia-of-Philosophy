    "main_text": "The Distinction Between Types and Tokens || What It Is Not\n1.2 What It Is Not\n\n\nAlthough the matter is discussed more fully in \u00a78 below, it should\nbe mentioned here at the outset that the type-token distinction is not\nthe same distinction as that between a type and (what logicians call)\nits occurrences. Unfortunately, tokens are often explained as\nthe \u201coccurrences\u201d of types, but not all occurrences of\ntypes are tokens. To see why, consider this time how many words there\nare in the Gertrude Stein line itself, the line type, not a\ntoken copy of it. Again, the correct answer is either three or ten, but\nthis time it cannot be ten word tokens. The line is an\nabstract type with no unique spatio-temporal location and therefore\ncannot consist of particulars, of tokens. But as there are only three\nword types of which it might consist, what then are we counting ten of?\nThe most apt answer is that (following logicians' usage) it is\ncomposed of ten occurrences of word types. See \u00a78 below,\nOccurrences, for more details.\n",
