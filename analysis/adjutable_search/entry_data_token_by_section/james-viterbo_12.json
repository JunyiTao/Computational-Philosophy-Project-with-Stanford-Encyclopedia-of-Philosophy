    "main_text": "Ethics || Connection of the Virtues\n7.2 Connection of the Virtues\n\nLike Albert the Great and Thomas Aquinas, James of Viterbo holds that\nthe moral virtues, considered as habits, i.e., virtuous dispositions\nor acts, are \u201cconnected.\u201d In other words, he believes that\none cannot have one of the virtues without having the others as well.\nThe virtues he has in mind are what he calls the \u201cpurely\u201d\nmoral virtues, that is, courage, justice, and temperance, which he\ndistinguishes from prudence, which is a partly moral, partly\nintellectual virtue. In his discussion in Quodl. II, q. 17\nJames begins by granting that the question is difficult and proceeds\nto expound Aristotle\u2019s solution to it, which he will ultimately\nadopt. As James sees it, Aristotle proves in Nicomachean\nEthics VI the connection of the purely moral virtues by showing\ntheir necessary relation to prudence, and this is to show that just as\nmoral virtue cannot be had without prudence, prudence cannot be had\nwithout moral virtue. The connection of the purely moral virtues\nfollows from this: they are necessarily connected because (1) each is\nconnected to prudence and (2) prudence is connected to the virtues\n(Quodl. II, q. 17, p. 187, 436 \u2013 p. 188, 441).\n",
