    "main_text": "The End of Morality\n5. The End of Morality\n\n\nBradley\u2019s excursion into moral psychology represents an\neffort to explain the process whereby one identifies one\u2019s\nsatisfaction with a particular ideal object, which is an essential\nelement in the structure of volitional action. He traces the\ntransitions from a very primitive state of mental life through to the\nsort of consciousness exhibited by a mature moral agent. From\nprimitive appetites which involve a precursor self that affirms itself\nthrough its desires we arrive at a variety of types of actions and of\nobjects of volition and different relations between the self and the\nobjects. Children move from the simple desire to possess the\nobject to the pleasure taken in the approval of others, to\nself-conscious moral action and its pleasures. These stages also reveal\nthe development of feelings and emotions and an increasing range of\ntypes of object that one might take pleasure in. In other words,\nthere is an extension of the individual\u2019s range of interests and\nthese move out beyond desired objects to an interest in other people\nand future events and so on. In this process the self is\ndeveloping its conception of itself and once it recognizes that its\nfate is tied to that of society we have a social self that does not see\nitself as being indifferent to the interests of others.\n\nAn important feature of this developmental process is gaining knowledge\nof good and bad and the capacity to will both. The need for this\narises, first, at the formal level of the structure of volitional\naction, which entails the dualism of inferior and superior selves (or\nconceptions of these). To get beyond formal necessary conditions\nto an account of specific actions this formal structure has to be\nfilled in with some determinate content which explains what the nature\nof these two selves is. At the level of social\nmorality this may involve no more than knowledge of what society\ndemands of me\u2014which I will identify as the superior, good self I\nshould be\u2014alongside my tendencies to go my own way which marks the\nbad self that opposes the social norms. But there must be more\nthan mere knowledge, for it is also necessary, psychologically, that we\nactually feel the tension produced by the conflicting tendencies to be\nboth good and bad. It is not simply that one fails to comprehend\nfully the nature of moral action without this, but that we also cannot\nfeel the contradictions that will move us to action, and without action\nthere is no morality. Hence, the common notion that moral agents\nare often viewed as having to expend a great deal of effort on the\ninternal struggle between the desire to be good and a propensity to do\nthings known to be bad is correct. In Bradley\u2019s theory the\nultimate moral end of self-realization presents two pictures of the\nself, labels one of these \u201csuperior\u201d and sets the moral\ntask as realizing that superior self in the face of the actual,\ninferior self. In this way moral conflicts are always internal\nstruggles. In acting morally I aim at realizing my good self,\nwhich I see as my true self. Yet I cannot in good faith say that\nmy bad self is not myself, with the result that, as Bradley rather\npicturesquely puts it, \u201cwhen I enter the lists against it, it is\nat my own breast that I lay my lance in rest\u201d (Ethical\nStudies, p. 277).\n\n\nUnfortunately, this also marks the final tension that renders\nmorality a self-contradiction. To the extent that people have both a\ngood and a bad self, they are a \u201cself-contradiction,\u201d and\nif these are necessary to morality as Bradley\u2019s suggests they are\nthen the ultimate moral end of action\u2014self-realization as an infinite\nwhole\u2014cannot be achieved. As he puts it, \u201cwe are a\nself-contradiction: we never are what we feel we really are; we really\nare what we know we are not; and if we became what we are, we should\nscarcely be ourselves\u201d (Ethical Studies, p. 234).\nMorality really seeks its own demise for were the ideal self realized\nthere would be nothing that remains to be actualized, at which point\nmorality is at an end. \u201cMorality aims at the cessation of\nthat which makes it possible\u201d (loc. cit.) This\nparallels Bradley\u2019s metaphysical position: if thought actually\nwere to capture the supra-relational unity that is Reality, thought\nwould have to have passed beyond itself, committing what Bradley calls\n\u201cthought\u2019s happy suicide.\u201d Because thought by\nits very nature analyzes and abstracts it cannot ever express the unity\nthat Reality is and which is only dimly felt in immediate\nexperience. Similarly for morality: \u201cit is the effort after\nnon-morality, and it presses forward beyond itself to a super-moral\nsphere where it ceases to exist as such\u201d (loc.\ncit.). Indeed, some writers think we can pass beyond\nmorality into the sphere of religion. One advantage of this is\nthat we might find an ideal moral type\u2014say the Jesus of Christianity\n- which provides an example of the ideal self we should be aiming\nat. In fact it could be claimed that in religion the self that is\nonly ideal in morality is actual in the religious experience. But at\nthe end of the day Bradley believes that the old moral dichotomy\nbetween good and bad will break out again, with \u2018sin\u2019\nreplacing the \u2018bad\u2019 of morality. Thus,\ndisharmony arises necessarily, and the moral self is not realized in\nreligious experience.\n\n\nNone of this should surprise us. Bradley\u2019s view is that\nevery study, whether it is of morality or the natural world or religion\nor whatever, begins from some working hypotheses. It is the job\nof metaphysics to lay bare these hypotheses and show how they all fit\ntogether. Were the final picture put together we would have an\nabsolute and finished view of reality. But attaining this\ncomprehensive and coherent view is impossible because of the nature of\nthought, and so the role of the notion of the Absolute\u2014a coherent,\ncomprehensive conception of Reality\u2014has the logic of a limiting\ncase. In morality we similarly seek an ideal self, one that is\nhomogeneous (coherent) but also fully specified (comprehensive),\nbut this is not attainable, as we have seen, thereby demonstrating that\nthe notion of an ideal self that is an infinite whole also has the\nlogic of a limiting case. It may guide our moral thinking and our\npractical reasoning, but it does not represent a condition anyone can\nachieve. Once we recognize that the end is not attainable,\nthat is the end of morality, and this is not a result of weakness on\nthe part of moral agents but a result of the logical structure of\nvolitional choice.\n",
