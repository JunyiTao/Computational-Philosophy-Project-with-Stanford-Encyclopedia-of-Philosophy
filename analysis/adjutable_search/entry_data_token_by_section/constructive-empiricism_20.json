    "main_text": "Arguments Against Constructive Empiricism || Observability of the Microscopic\n3.8 Observability of the Microscopic\n\nThe Hermeneutic Circle objection was prefaced on the claim that what\ncounts as observable is, according to the constructive empiricist,\ndetermined by scientific theory. Another worry based on that\npresupposition, raised by Alspector-Kelly (2004), is that scientific\ntheory determines much more to be observable than the constructive\nempiricist typically allows. On Alspector-Kelly\u2019s view, we\nshould countenance as observable whatever science says we can have\nreliable information about on the basis of perceptual experience, and\nscience says we can have reliable information about what is\nperceptually revealed to us via microscopes.\n\nThe electron microscope is a window on the microcosm because it\ngenerates reliable images\u2026 We know of that reliability in\nvirtue of knowing the science behind it, just as the constructive\nempiricist knows the limits of unaided human observation by knowing\nthe science behind the perceptual process. (Alspector-Kelly 2004, 347)\n\n\nGiven what it is for experience to provide us with information about\nthe world, electron microscopes and the rest do precisely that for our\ncommunity\u2026 even a relatively conservative estimation of our\nperceptual abilities, concerned with both reliability and\nfidelity, has them extending much farther into the microcosm\nthan the overly conservative constructive empiricist is willing to\nrecognize. (Alspector-Kelly 2004, 348)\n\n\nIn response to Alspector-Kelly, Kusch (2015) insists that the\nconstructive empiricist can rely on science to determine what counts\nas observable, without at the same time countenancing the\nmicroscopic as observable. That\u2019s because \u201cthe phenomenon\nof naked-eye observation calls for one (kind of) theory; the\nphenomenon of instrumentally-aided eye-use calls for at least two\n(kinds of) theories: the theory covering naked-eye observation and\ntheories of the instrument and its interaction with our naked\neyes\u201d (179). As noted earlier, constructive empiricists value\nepistemic modesty. If a constructive empiricist can rely on science to\ngive us an account of the kind of unaided observation in which all\nscience is grounded, without at the same time having to make use of\nscientific theories that go farther afield, then by the constructive\nempiricist\u2019s lights, that more modest invocation of science is\nto be preferred in deciding the question of observability.\n",
