    "main_text": "Vico\u2019s Life and Influence\n1. Vico\u2019s Life and Influence\n\nGiovanni Battista Vico was born in Naples, Italy, June 23 1668, to a\nbookseller and daughter of a carriage maker. He received his formal\neducation at local grammar schools, from various Jesuit tutors, and at\nthe University of Naples from which he graduated in 1694 as Doctor of\nCivil and Canon Law. As he reports in his autobiography (Vita di\nGiambattista Vico), however, Vico considered himself as\n\u201cteacher of\n himself,\u201d[1]\n a habit he developed under the direction of his father, after a fall\nat the age of 7 caused a three year absence from school. Vico reports\nthat \u201cas a result of this mischance he grew up with a melancholy\nand irritable temperament such as belongs to men of ingenuity and\ndepth\u201d (Vita, 111). Vico left Naples in 1686 for Vatolla where,\nwith occasional returns to his home city, he remained for the next\nnine years as tutor to the sons of Domenico Rocca. Vico returned to\nNaples in 1695 and four years later married Teresa Caterina Destito\nwith whom he had eight children. Of his surviving children (three of\nthem died), his younger son Gennaro was a favorite and went on to an\nacademic career; his daughter Lusia achieved success as a singer and\nminor poet, and Ignazio is known to have been a source of\ndisappointment to him. Of the others (Angela Teresa and Filippo)\nlittle is known. Vico was never rich, though he made a living, and the\nlegend of his poverty derives from Villarosa\u2019s embellishment of\nthe autobiography. He did, however, suffer bouts of ill-health, and\nfailed in his life-long ambition of succeeding to the chair of\nJurisprudence at the University of Naples, having to settle instead\nfor a lower and poorly paid professorship in Rhetoric. He retained\nthis position until 1741 at which time he was succeeded by his son\nGennaro. Vico died in Naples on January 22\u201323, 1744, aged\n75.\n\nIn his own time Vico\u2019s work was largely neglected and generally\nmisunderstood-he describes himself living as a \u201cstranger\u201d\nand \u201cquite unknown\u201d in his native city (Vita, 134)-and it\nwas not until the nineteenth century that his thought began to make a\nsignificant impression on the philosophical world. However,\nVico\u2019s thought never suffered from complete obscurity and its\ninfluence can be discerned in various traditions of European thought\nfrom the mid-eighteenth century\n onwards.[2]\n In Italy, Vico\u2019s impact on aesthetic and literary criticism is\nevident in the writings of Francesco De Sanctis and Benedetto Croce,\nand in jurisprudence, economics, and political theory, his influence\ncan be traced from Antonio Genovesi (one of Vico\u2019s own pupils),\nFerdinando Galiani, and Gaetano Filangieri. In Germany, Vico\u2019s\nideas were known to Johann-George Hamman and, via his disciple J.G.\nvon Herder, to Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich Heinrich\nJacobi. Vico\u2019s ideas were sufficiently familiar to Friedrich\nAugust Wolf to inspire his article \u201cG.B. Vico on Homer.\u201d\nIn France, Vico\u2019s thought was likely known to Charles de\nSecondat, baron de Montesquieu, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and some\nhave seen his influence in the writings of Denis Diderot, Etienne\nBonnot, abb\u00e9 de Condillac, and Joseph Marie, comte de Maistre.\nIn Great Britain, although Vichian themes are intimated in the\nphilosophical writings of the Empiricists and thinkers of the Scottish\nEnlightenment, there is no direct evidence that they knew of his\nwritings. The earliest known disseminator of Vico\u2019s views in the\nEnglish-speaking world is Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who was responsible\nfor much of the interest in Vico in the second half of the nineteenth\ncentury.\n\nVico\u2019s ideas reached a wider audience with a German translation\nof The New Science by W.E. Weber which appeared in 1822, and,\nmore significantly, through a French version by Jules Michelet in\n1824, which was reissued in 1835. Michelet\u2019s translation was\nwidely read and was responsible for a new appreciation of Vico\u2019s\nwork in France. Subsequently, Vico\u2019s views impacted the work of\nWilhelm Dilthey, Karl Marx, R.G. Collingwood, and James Joyce, who\nused The New Science to structure Finnegans Wake.\nTwentieth century scholarship has established illuminating comparisons\nwith the tradition of Hegelian idealism, and taken up the relationship\nbetween Vico\u2019s thought and that of philosophers in the western\ntradition and beyond, including Plato, Aristotle, Ibn Khaldun, Thomas\nHobbes, Benedict de Spinoza, David Hume, Immanuel Kant, and Friedrich\nNietzsche. Comparisons and connections have also been drawn between\nVichean themes and the work of various modern and contemporary\nthinkers, inter alia W.B. Yeats, Friedrich Froebel, Max\nHorkheimer, Walter Benjamin, Martin Heidegger, Hans-Georg Gadamer,\nJ\u00fcrgen Habermas, Paul Ricoeur, Jean-Francois Lyotard, and\nAlisdair MacIntyre. As a review of recent and current literature\ndemonstrates, an appreciation of Vico\u2019s thought has spread far\nbeyond philosophy, and his ideas have been taken up by scholars within\na range of contemporary disciplines, including anthropology, cultural\ntheory, education, hermeneutics, history, literary criticism,\npsychology, and sociology. Thus despite obscure beginnings, Vico is\nnow widely regarded as a highly original thinker who anticipated\ncentral currents in later philosophy and the human sciences.\n\n\n",
