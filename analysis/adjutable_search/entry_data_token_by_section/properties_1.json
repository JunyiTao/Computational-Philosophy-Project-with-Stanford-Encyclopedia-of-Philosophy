    "main_text": "Properties: Basic Ideas || How We Speak of Properties\n1.1 How We Speak of Properties\n\nProperties are expressed, as meanings, by\npredicates. In the past \u201cpredicate\u201d was often\nused as synonym of \u201cproperty\u201d, but nowadays predicates are\nlinguistic entities, typically contrasted with singular\nterms, i.e., simple or complex noun phrases such as\n\u201cDaniel\u201d, \u201cthis horse\u201d or \u201cthe President\nof France\u201d, which can occupy subject positions in sentences and\npurport to denote, or refer to, a single thing.\nFollowing Frege, predicates are verbal phrases such as\n\u201cis French\u201d or \u201cdrinks\u201d. Alternatively,\npredicates are general terms such as \u201cFrench\u201d,\nwith the copula \u201cis\u201d (or verbal inflection) taken to\nconvey an exemplification link (P. Strawson 1959; Bergmann 1960). We\nshall conveniently use \u201cpredicate\u201d in both ways.\nPredicates are predicated of singular terms, thereby\ngenerating sentences such as \u201cDaniel is French\u201d. In the\nfamiliar formal language of first-order logic, this would be rendered,\nsay, as \u201c\\(F(d)\\)\u201d, thus representing the predicate with a\ncapital letter. The set or class of objects to which a predicate\nveridically applies is often called the extension of the\npredicate, or of the corresponding property. This property, in\ncontrast, is called the intension of the predicate, i.e., its\nmeaning. This terminology traces back to the Middle Age and in the\nlast century has led to the habit of calling sets and properties\nextensional and intensional entities, respectively.\nExtensions and intensions can hardly be identified; this is\nimmediately suggested by paradigmatic examples of co-extensional\npredicates that appear to differ in meaning, such as \u201chas a\nheart\u201d, and \u201chas kidneys\u201d (see\n \u00a73.1).\n\nProperties can also be referred to by singular terms, or so it seems.\nFirst of all, there are singular terms, e.g., \u201cbeing\nhonest\u201d or \u201chonesty\u201d, that result from the\nnominalization of predicates, such as \u201cis honest\u201d\nor \u201chonest\u201d (some think that \u201cbeing \\(F\\)\u201d and\n\u201c\\(F\\)-ness\u201d stand for different kinds of property\n(Levinson 1991). Further, there are definite descriptions, such as\n\u201cMary\u2019s favorite property\u201d. Finally, though more\ncontroversially, there are demonstratives, such as \u201cthat shade\nof red\u201d, deployed while pointing to a red object (Heal\n1997).\n\nFrege (1892) and Russell (1903) had different opinions regarding the\nontological import of nominalization. According to the former,\nnominalized predicates stand for a \u201ccorrelate\u201d of the\n\u201cunsaturated\u201d entity that the predicate stands for (in\nFrege\u2019s terminology they are a \u201cconcept correlate\u201d\nand a \u201cconcept\u201d, respectively). According to the latter,\nwho speaks of \u201cinextricable difficulties\u201d in Frege\u2019s\nview (Russell 1903: \u00a749), they stand for exactly the same entity.\nMutatis mutandis, they similarly disagreed about other\nsingular terms that seemingly refer to properties. The ontological\ndistinction put forward by Frege is mainly motivated by the fact that\ngrammar indeed forbids the use of predicates in subject position. But\nthis hardly suffices for the distinction and it is dubious that other\nmotivations can be marshalled (Parsons 1986). We shall thus take for\ngranted Russell\u2019s line here, although many philosophers support\nFrege\u2019s view or at least take it very seriously\n(Casta\u00f1eda 1976; Cocchiarella 1986a; Landini 2008).\n",
