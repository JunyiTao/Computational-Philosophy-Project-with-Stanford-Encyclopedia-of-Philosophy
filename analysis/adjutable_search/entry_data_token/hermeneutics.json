Hermeneutics plays a role\nin a number of disciplines whose subject matter demands interpretative\napproaches, characteristically, because the disciplinary subject\nmatter concerns the meaning of human intentions, beliefs, and actions,\nor the meaning of human experience as it is preserved in the arts and\nliterature, historical testimony, and other artifacts. Traditionally,\ndisciplines that rely on hermeneutics include theology, especially\nBiblical studies, jurisprudence, and medicine, as well as some of the\nhuman sciences, social sciences, and humanities. In such contexts,\nhermeneutics is sometimes described as an \u201cauxiliary\u201d\nstudy of the arts, methods, and foundations of research appropriate to\na respective disciplinary subject matter (Grondin 1994, 1). For\nexample, in theology, Biblical hermeneutics concerns the general\nprinciples for the proper interpretation of the Bible. More recently,\napplied hermeneutics has been further developed as a research method\nfor a number of disciplines (see, for example, Moules inter alia\n2015).\n\nWithin philosophy, however, hermeneutics typically signifies, first, a\ndisciplinary area and, second, the historical movement in which this\narea has been developed. As a disciplinary area, and on analogy with\nthe designations of other disciplinary areas (such as \u2018the\nphilosophy of mind\u2019 or \u2018the philosophy of art\u2019),\nhermeneutics might have been named \u2018the philosophy of\ninterpretation.\u2019 Hermeneutics thus treats interpretation itself\nas its subject matter and not as an auxiliary to the study of\nsomething else. Philosophically, hermeneutics therefore concerns the\nmeaning of interpretation\u2014its basic nature, scope and validity,\nas well as its place within and implications for human existence; and\nit treats interpretation in the context of fundamental philosophical\nquestions about being and knowing, language and history, art and\naesthetic experience, and practical life.\n", "toc": [{"#InteExpe": "1.

Interpretive Experience\n\nThe topic of this article, then, is hermeneutics insofar as it is\ngrasped as the philosophy of interpretation and as the historical\nmovement associated with this area. In this, hermeneutics is\nconcerned, first of all, to clarify and, in turn, to establish the\nscope and validity of interpretive experience.\n1.1 Understanding as Educative\n\nIn hermeneutics, interpretive experience is typically clarified in\nreference to understanding. In this context, when we say that we\nunderstand, what we mean is that we have really gotten at something\nthrough an attempt at interpretation; and, when we say we do not\nunderstand, we mean that we have not really gotten anywhere at all\nwith our interpretation. For this reason, understanding can be\ndescribed as a \u2018success\u2019 of interpretation (even if, since\nHeidegger, understanding is more commonly described as a fulfillment,\nrealization, or enactment). In hermeneutics, such success of\nunderstanding is not measured by norms and methods typical of the\nmodern natural sciences and quantitative social sciences, such as\nwhether our understanding derives from a repeatable experiment, nor by\nnorms typical of much of modern philosophy, such as whether our\nunderstanding has indubitable epistemic foundations.\n\nNow, philosophers associated with hermeneutics describe the success of\nunderstanding in a number of manners. However else the success of\nunderstanding is described, though, it is typically also described as\nedifying or educative. Indeed, Hans-Georg Gadamer, the\nphilosopher perhaps most closely associated with hermeneutics in our\ntimes, closely connects interpretive experience with education. By\neducation, he has in mind the concept of formation (Bildung)\nthat had been developed in Weimar classicism and that continued to\ninfluence nineteenth-century romanticism and historicism in Germany\n(Truth and Method, Part\n I.1).[1]\n Education, as formation, involves more than the acquisition of\nexpertise, knowledge, or information; it concerns the enlargement of\nour person through formal instruction, especially in the arts and\nhumanities, as well as through extensive and variegated experience.\nAccordingly, the success of understanding is educative in that we\nlearn from our interpretive experience, perhaps not only about a\nmatter, but thereby also about ourselves, the world, and others.\n\nThat the success of understanding is educative in this manner can be\nclarified by an example, say, in reading a text such as\nThucydides\u2019 History of the Peloponnesian War. When we\nsay that we understand this text, we mean that our attempts to\ninterpret it (whether rigorously, as in scholarship, or more casually,\nas in evening reading) have gotten at something, perhaps: that in\npolitics, prudent reasoning is not always persuasive enough to stem\nthe tide of war. Certainly, we have not arrived at this understanding\nin result of repeatable scientific experiment or based on an\nindubitable epistemic foundation. But it is not for this reason any\nless educative. In this understanding, we have come to something that\nwe can agree or disagree with, something that in any case expands or\nchanges our views about the role of reason in politics (and no doubt\nthen also of public discourse and the causes of war), and, finally,\nsomething that can also teach us something about ourselves and the\nworld in which we find ourselves.\n1.2 Against Foundationalism\n\nHermeneutics may be said to involve a positive attitude\u2014at once\nepistemic, existential, and even ethical and political\u2014toward\nthe finitude of human understanding, that is, the fact that our\nunderstanding is time and again bested by the things we wish to grasp,\nthat what we understand remains ineluctably incomplete, even partial,\nand open to further consideration. In hermeneutics, the concern is\ntherefore not primarily to establish norms or methods which would\npurport to help us overcome or eradicate aspects of such finitude,\nbut, instead, to recognize the consequences of our limits.\nAccordingly, hermeneutics affirms that we must remain ever vigilant\nabout how common wisdom and prejudices inform\u2014and can\ndistort\u2014our perception and judgment, that even the most\nestablished knowledge may be in need of reconsideration, and that this\nfinitude of understanding is not simply a regrettable fact of the\nhuman condition but, more importantly, that this finitude is itself an\nimportant opening for the pursuit of new and different meaning. In\nview of this positive attitude toward the finitude of human\nunderstanding, it is no surprise that hermeneutics opposes\nfoundationalism.\n\nHermeneutics opposes what can be described as the\n\u2018vertical\u2019 picture of knowledge at issue in\nepistemological foundationalism, focusing, instead, on the\n\u2018circularity\u2019 at issue in understanding. In\nepistemological foundationalism, our body of beliefs (or at least our\njustified beliefs) are sometimes said to have the structure of an\nedifice. Some beliefs are distinguished as foundations, ultimately,\nbecause they depend on no further beliefs for their justification;\nother beliefs are distinguished as founded, in that their\njustification depends on the foundational beliefs (Steup and Neta\n2015, Section 4.1). This is a \u2018vertical\u2019 picture of human\nknowledge in that new beliefs build on established beliefs; new\nbeliefs are justified on the basis of already justified beliefs, and\nthese beliefs, in turn, are justified by still other beliefs, all the\nway down to the foundational beliefs. Inquiry, then, is an\n\u2018upward\u2019 pursuit, one that adds new \u2018floors\u2019\nto the edifice of what we already know.\n1.3 The Hermeneutical Circle\n\nIn hermeneutics, by contrast, the emphasis is on the\n\u2018circularity\u2019 of understanding. This emphasis is familiar\nfrom the concept of the hermeneutical circle. Central to hermeneutics,\nthis concept is not only highly disputed but has also been developed\nin a number of distinct manners. Broadly, however, the concept of the\nhermeneutical circle signifies that, in interpretive experience, a new\nunderstanding is achieved not on the basis of already securely founded\nbeliefs. Instead, a new understanding is achieved through renewed\ninterpretive attention to further possible meanings of those\npresuppositions which, sometimes tacitly, inform the understanding\nthat we already\n have.[2]\n Philosophers have described such hermeneutically circular\npresuppositions in different ways and, since Heidegger, especially in\nterms of presuppositions of the existential and historical contexts in\nwhich we find ourselves. This contemporary significance of\nhermeneutically circular presuppositions has origins in an older (and\nperhaps more commonly known) formulation, namely, that interpretive\nexperience\u2014classically, that of text\ninterpretation\u2014involves us in a circular relation of whole and\nparts. This formulation derives from antiquity and has a place in the\napproaches of nineteenth-century figures such as Schleiermacher and\nDilthey. On the one hand, it is necessary to understand a text as a\nwhole in order properly to understand any of its parts. On the other\nhand, however, it is necessary to understand the text in each of its\nparts in order to understand it as a whole.\n\nIn contemporary hermeneutics, the concept of the hermeneutical circle\nis rarely restricted to the context of text interpretation, and, too,\nthe circularity of interpretive experience is not necessarily cast in\nterms of the relation of whole and parts. Nevertheless, as Grondin\nsuggests, this older formulation can help to illustrate the circular\ncharacter of interpretive experience (2016, 299). In text\ninterpretation so conceived, our efforts to understand a text have no\nfirm foundation from which to begin. Rather, these efforts unfold\nalways in media res, through an interpretation of the whole\nof a text that proceeds from presuppositions about the parts; and, no\nless, through an interpretation of the parts that proceeds from\npresuppositions about the whole. Understanding, then, is not pursued\n\u2018vertically\u2019 by layering beliefs on top of foundations,\nbut rather \u2018circularly,\u2019 in an interpretive movement back\nand forth through possible meanings of our presuppositions that by\nturns allow a matter to come into view. In this, the pursuit of\nunderstanding does not build \u2018higher and higher;\u2019 it goes\n\u2018deeper and deeper,\u2019 gets \u2018fuller and fuller,\u2019\nor, perhaps \u2018richer and richer.\u2019\n2. Hermeneutics as Historical Movement\n\nHermeneutics, taken as a historical movement, is informed by a longer\nhistory that dates back to antiquity. The modern history of\nhermeneutics originates with figures in nineteenth- and early\ntwentieth-century German thought, especially Friedrich Schleiermacher\nand Wilhelm Dilthey. Contemporary hermeneutics is shaped, in turn,\nespecially by Martin Heidegger and Hans-Georg Gadamer, as well as by\nPaul Ricoeur and others (see Palmer 1969, Grondin 1994, L. Schmidt\n2006, Zimmerman 2015).\n2.1 The Art of Interpretation\n\nIn accord with a common account of the modern historical origins of\nhermeneutics, recognizably philosophical contributions to hermeneutics\noriginate with Friedrich\n Schleiermacher.[3]\n Closely associated with German romanticism, Schleiermacher developed\nhis hermeneutics in the first decades of the nineteenth century. He\nproposes a universal hermeneutics that pertains to all linguistic\nexperience, and not just to the interpretative concerns of specific\ndisciplines (Scholtz 2015, 68). Schleiermacher characterizes\nhermeneutics as the art of interpretation, maintaining that this art\nis called for not simply to avoid misunderstandings in regard to\notherwise readily intelligible discourses. Rather, the art of\ninterpretation is necessary for discourses, paradigmatically written\ntexts, in regard to which our interpretive experience begins in\nmisunderstanding (Schleiermacher, \u201cOutline,\u201d \u00a7\u00a7\n15\u201316). Schleiermacher\u2019s hermeneutics is multifaceted but\nkeyed to the idea that the success of understanding depends on the\nsuccessful interpretation of two sides of a discourse, the\n\u2018grammatical\u2019 and \u2018psychological\u2019\n(Schleiermacher, \u201cOutline,\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 5\u20136). By\nthe \u2018grammatical\u2019 side, he means the contributions to the\nmeaning of the discourse dependent on the general structure of the\nlanguage it uses. By the \u2018psychological\u2019 side, he has in\nview the contributions to the meaning of the discourse dependent on\nthe individual author\u2019s or creator\u2019s mind. Whereas the\n\u2018grammatical\u2019 side of a discourse is a matter of general\nlinguistic structures, the \u2018psychological\u2019 side finds\nexpression in linguistic forms that would traditionally be associated\nwith style.\n\nSchleiermacher indicates that discourses can be differentiated by\nwhether they are predominated by the \u2018grammatical\u2019 or\n\u2018psychological\u2019 and he develops methodological\nconsiderations appropriate to these sides. At the same time, though,\nhe recognizes that the interpretation of each side is reciprocally\ninformed by the other (see Schleiermacher, \u201cOutline,\u201d\n\u00a7 11, \u00a7 12). Interpretation aims at the\n\u201creconstruction\u201d of the meaning of a discourse, but, in\nthis, the task is \u201cto understand the discourse just as well or\neven better than its creator,\u201d a task which, accordingly, is\n\u201cinfinite\u201d (Schleiermacher, \u201cOutline,\u201d \u00a7\n18).\n2.2 Justification of the Human Sciences\n\nThe history of the modern origins of hermeneutics includes distinctive\ncontributions by Wilhelm Dilthey. Whereas Schleiermacher\u2019s\nhermeneutics is closely associated with German romanticism,\nDilthey\u2019s considerations may be grasped in connection with\nhistoricism. \u2018Historicism\u2019 refers to a nineteenth- and\nearly twentieth-century intellectual movement that no longer treated\n\u201chuman nature, morality, and reason as absolute, eternal, and\nuniversal,\u201d but sought, instead, to grasp these as\n\u201crelative, changing and particular,\u201d shaped by historical\ncontext (Beiser 2011, 1). Dilthey\u2019s overall (though never\ncompleted) project was to establish a critique of historical reason\nthat would secure independent epistemological foundations of research\nin the human sciences, that is, the sciences distinguished by their\nfocus on historical experience (Grondin 1994, 84\u201390; Bambach\n1995, 127\u2013185; Makkreel 2015). In this, Dilthey\u2019s concern\nis to defend the legitimacy of the human sciences against charges\neither that their legitimacy remains dependent on norms and methods of\nthe natural sciences or, to his mind worse, that they lack the kind of\nlegitimacy found in the natural sciences altogether.\n\nDilthey associates the purpose of the human sciences not with the\nexplanation of \u2018outer\u2019 experience, but, instead, with the\nunderstanding of \u2018lived experience\u2019 (Erlebnis).\nIn an important essay, \u201cThe Rise of Hermeneutics,\u201d Dilthey\naffirms that the understanding achieved in the human sciences involves\ninterpretation. But this means that hermeneutics, grasped as the\ntheory of the universal validity of interpretation, does more than lay\nout the rules of successful interpretive practice. Hermeneutics\nclarifies the validity of the research conducted in the human\nsciences. Indeed, he ventures that the \u201cmain purpose\u201d of\nhermeneutics is \u201cto preserve the general validity of\ninterpretation against the inroads of romantic caprice and skeptical\nsubjectivity, and to give a theoretical justification of such\nvalidity, upon which all the certainty of historical knowledge is\nfounded\u201d (Dilthey, \u201cThe Rise of Hermeneutics,\u201d\nSection V).\n\nWhile Schleiermacher and Dilthey are central for the modern historical\norigins of hermeneutics, hermeneutics has also been shaped by\ncontributions from other figures, such as Friedrich Ast. And\nhermeneutics has also been influenced by ideas about meaning, history,\nand language developed in the period by figures such as Johann\nGottfried Herder, Wilhelm von Humboldt, and Friedrich Schlegel (see\nGrondin 1994; Rush 2020).\n2.3 Contemporary Hermeneutics\n\nContemporary hermeneutics is demarcated from the modern historical\norigins of hermeneutics by the influence of a new use Heidegger makes\nof hermeneutics in his early phenomenological inquiries into human\nexistence. In turn, contemporary hermeneutics remains largely shaped\nby Hans-Georg Gadamer\u2019s \u2018philosophical\nhermeneutics,\u2019 which he describes as an attempt further to develop\nand expand on Heidegger\u2019s influential breakthrough. Contemporary\nhermeneutics also receives contour from Paul Ricoeur\u2019s\ncontributions to hermeneutics, from philosophical controversies with\ncritical theory and deconstruction, and from the emergence of\npostmodern hermeneutics. Further developments include innovations in\nhermeneutics made by some philosophers in the Anglo-American tradition\nand the development of hermeneutics in ethical and political\nphilosophy. Most recently, further developments include a renewal of\ninterest in normative dimensions of interpretive experience, and\nresponses in hermeneutics to a recent rise of interest in realism.\n3. Hermeneutics and Existence\n\nThe principal impetus for contemporary hermeneutics, then, is a new\nuse Heidegger makes of hermeneutics in his early phenomenological\ninquiries into what, in Being and Time, he calls the\n\u2018being\u2019 or also, the \u2018existentiality,\u2019 of\nhuman \u2018existence\u2019 (Heidegger, Being and Time,\n\u00a7 7, section C). Heidegger\u2019s philosophy is oriented by the\nquestion of the meaning, or, sense of being (die Frage nach dem\nSinn des Seins), but as he argues in Being and Time,\ninquiry into this question itself begins with inquiry into the sense\nin which human beings can be said to be or exist (Heidegger, Being\nand Time, \u00a7\u00a7 1\u20134). Heidegger defines inquiry into\nthe sense of the being of human existence as hermeneutical, that is,\nas a matter of self-interpretation. Within this context, Heidegger\nleaves behind the idea that hermeneutics is primarily concerned with\nthe methods or foundations of research in the arts and humanities.\nRather, as he argues, such hermeneutical research is itself only\npossible because human beings are, in their very being, interpretive.\nFor Heidegger, understanding is a mode or possibility of human\nexistence, and, indeed, one that is projective, oriented toward the\ninterpretive possibilities available to us in the situations in which\nwe find ourselves (see especially Heidegger, Being and Time,\n\u00a7\u00a7 31\u201332). Accordingly, inquiry into the sense of the\nbeing of human existence is enacted in our own attempts to understand\nour own being, as we may interpret our being through the course of our\naffairs.\n\nHeidegger\u2019s use of hermeneutics in the context of his early\nphenomenological inquiries into human existence can be described as a\nbreakthrough in the historical movement of hermeneutics (Gadamer,\nTruth and Method, Part II.3). But Heidegger\u2019s\nconsiderations also continue to be a subject of considerable\ndiscussion, and his insights remain at issue, to a greater or lesser\ndegree, in a range of current philosophers and debates.\nHeidegger\u2019s later works are important for hermeneutical\nconsiderations of history, language, art, poetry, and translation, as\nwell. As Heidegger develops, however, he comes to claim that his paths\nof thinking can no longer be served by hermeneutics, and his thought\ncomes to be characterized by new and different orientations.\n3.1 The Hermeneutics of Facticity\n\nHeidegger clarifies the role played by hermeneutics in his early\nphenomenological inquiries into human existence through a critical\nreconsideration of Husserl\u2019s classical phenomenology, or more\nspecifically, a critical reconsideration of the aspects of\nHusserl\u2019s phenomenology that rely on his transcendental and\neidetic\n methods.[4]\n In this, Heidegger opposes his own \u2018hermeneutical\u2019\nphenomenology against Husserl\u2019s \u2018transcendental\u2019\napproach.\n\nHusserl\u2019s phenomenology is guided by epistemological\nconsiderations, and his principal concern is to find a priori\nfoundations for research in the sciences. Husserl believes that modern\nscience, despite all methodological and technological sophistication,\nhas failed to account for the basic epistemic foundation on which it\nrelies. He maintains that this foundation may be discerned in\nconsciousness\u2014not, however, in any factual consciousness or ego,\nbut rather in the transcendental ego and its a priori eidetic\nstructures. He argues that phenomenological inquiry into these\nstructures proceeds methodologically on the basis of what he refers to\nas the \u2018epoch\u00e9.\u2019 The\nepoch\u00e9 is a universal suspension of the \u2018natural\nattitude,\u2019 that is, belief in the existence of objects. The epoch\u00e9 thereby allows us to redirect our awareness to objects in their\nappearance as such. In contrast with Cartesian methodological doubt,\nthe epoch\u00e9 is not a doubt about the existence of\nmind-independent reality, but, instead, a \u2018bracketing\u2019 of\nour belief in existence that frees us to focus on a priori\neidetic structures of appearance (see, for example, Husserl,\nIdeas I, \u00a7\u00a7 27\u201332).\n\nHeidegger\u2019s critical reconsideration of Husserl\u2019s\nphenomenology is guided not by epistemological concerns, but, instead,\nfundamental ontological ones. Heidegger agrees with Husserl that\nmodern science has failed to account for the grounds on which it\nrelies, and he also turns to phenomenology in order to bring these\ngrounds into focus. Yet, Heidegger believes that phenomenology\nconcerns an origin much deeper than consciousness, the transcendental\nego, and its eidetic structures. For him, phenomenology contributes to\nontology, first of all, by bringing into focus the being, or,\nontological structures, that comprise human existence itself. For the\nearly Heidegger, these structures involve what he calls\n\u2018facticity.\u2019 By this, he does not mean that human\nexistence is a fact. Rather, he means that the ontological structures\nthat comprise human existence are found not in consciousness, but,\ninstead, in our being in the world\u2014or, as he determines this\nterminologically, being-in-the-world (in-der-Welt-sein)\n(Heidegger, Being and Time, \u00a7 12 ff.). Thus, our\nattempts to understand ourselves (or, for that matter, to understand\nanything else) remain bound by structures of being in the world.\nSpecifically, our attempts to understand ourselves (or anything else)\nremain conditioned by pre-structures that determine in advance which\npossibilities of a situation we find significant, and by moods that\ndetermine in advance our attunement to a situation we are\n\u201cthrown\u201d into, that is, a situation that affects us even\nthough we have not chosen to be in it (Heidegger, Being and\nTime, \u00a7\u00a7 28\u201334).\n\nHeidegger, on the basis of his consideration of the facticity of human\nexistence, concludes that it would be a fool\u2019s errand for\nphenomenological inquiry to proceed on the basis of Husserl\u2019s\nepoch\u00e9. After all, the epoch\u00e9 merely\nallows us to reflect on a priori eidetic structures of\nconsciousness, when what we should be after are structures of our\nbeing in the world. Heidegger argues that phenomenological inquiry\nshould begin instead with consideration of these structures of being\nin the world as they come into view through our own individual\ninvolvement in the world. Heidegger\u2019s phenomenology proves to be\nself-interpretation, as it seeks to clarify the structure of being in\nthe world on the basis of nothing else than our own individual\nexperience of being in the world. Thus, phenomenology unfolds as the\nexplication of the structures of being in the world that, initially at\nleast, we experience more or less vaguely, more or less tacitly, in\nour own everyday involvements with things and others. In\nHeidegger\u2019s critical reconsideration of Husserl\u2019s\nphenomenology, hermeneutics is a possibility of human existence itself\nand, indeed, a possibility that aims at our explication of ourselves\nin our very existence.\n3.2 Difficulties of Self-Interpretation\n\nHeidegger maintains that such self-interpretation of existence is\nfraught with difficulties. One reason, he believes, is that structures\nof being in the world are made inconspicuous by the very involvement\nin the world that they enable. He famously makes this case in the\ncourse of his phenomenological considerations of the way we find human\nexistence \u201cinitially and for the most part,\u201d namely, in\nthe undifferentiated \u201caverageness\u201d of everyday existence\n(Heidegger, Being and Time, 43; \u00a7 20). In this\naverageness of everyday existence, Heidegger argues, the structure of\nthe world is given through the purposes we have, the referential\nrelations that comprise the situations in which we attempt to realize\nthese ends, and the things we employ in the service of these ends. In\nthe averageness of everyday existence, our access to this structure is\ngranted not through reflection on it but, instead, through our\nordinary affairs, as we cognize the structure indirectly through the\nthings (Zeuge, useful things or tools) that we employ to\ncarry out our projects (Heidegger, Being and Time,\n\u00a7\u00a7 14\u201318; see also Heidegger, Ontology,\n\u00a7 20). Yet, as he argues, in this form of cognizance,\n\u201ccircumspection\u201d (Umsicht), the structure of the\nworld itself recedes from view precisely by our absorption in those\nprojects (Heidegger, Being and Time, 69).\n\nHeidegger maintains that the self-interpretation of existence is made\ndifficult, moreover, because being in the world always also entails\nbeing with others. In this, Heidegger argues that in the averageness\nof everyday existence, we tend to interpret ourselves not by what\ndifferentiates us from others, but, instead, by what can be attributed\nindifferently to anyone. Such interpretations may be attractive\nbecause accessible to anyone, but they come at the price of being\ndistorting and reductive. In the averageness of everyday existence,\nthe sense of self that comes into focus through self-interpretation is\nnot a self in its singular possibilities to be. It is rather a sense\nof self characterized by circumscribed possibilities, which, for\nHeidegger, finds expression in the pronoun \u2018they,\u2019 or\n\u2018one\u2019 (das Man)\u2014so that we interpret our own possibilities\nrestrictively in terms of what \u2018one\u2019 thinks, what\n\u2018one\u2019 does, and no more (see Heidegger Being and\nTime, \u00a7 27; see also Heidegger, Ontology, \u00a7\n6).\n\nAnother, related difficulty of self-interpretation concerns the\nhistorical transmission of interpretations. In this, Heidegger\nmaintains that, as interpretations of existence are passed down from\ntradition, the \u201coriginal sources\u201d of concrete, existential\nconcern, come to be covered over (Heidegger, Ontology, 59).\nIndeed, for this reason, Heidegger calls for a\n\u201cdestruction\u201d or, perhaps, \u2018de-structuration\u2019\n(Destruktion) of interpretations of being and the being of\nexistence that have been passed down from the history of Western\nphilosophy (see Heidegger, Being and Time, \u00a76).\nThis, to be sure, is a call that has important implications for the\nstudy of the history of philosophy, one that has been influential for\nphilosophers such as Jacques Derrida, John Sallis, and Claudia\nBaracchi.\n4. Contemporary Hermeneutics\n\nContemporary hermeneutics is largely shaped by Hans-Georg\nGadamer\u2019s \u2018philosophical hermeneutics.\u2019\nGadamer\u2019s approach is guided by the insight that the success of\nunderstanding involves a distinctive experience of truth. Consider,\nonce more, the example of coming to understand something through an\ninterpretation of Thucydides\u2019 History of the Peloponnesian\nWar, namely, that in politics, prudent reasoning is not always\npersuasive enough to stem the tide of war. When I come to understand\nthis, so goes Gadamer\u2019s insight, I experience what I understand\nnot simply as a novel or enriching idea. Rather, I experience what I\nhave understood as something that makes a claim to be true. Thus, to\nunderstand something means to understand something as true. The chief\nissue of Gadamer\u2019s philosophical hermeneutics is to clarify that\nsuch a hermeneutical experience of truth is not only valid in its own\nright, but that it is distinct from, and even more original than, the\nsense of truth at issue in knowledge secured through the norms and\nmethods of modern science. Indeed, it is precisely this concern that\nGadamer\u2019s title of his magnum opus is meant to evoke:\nhis philosophical hermeneutics focuses on a hermeneutical experience\nof truth that cannot be derived from scientific\nmethod.\n4.1 Humanism and Art\n\nThe point de d\u00e9part for Gadamer\u2019s philosophical\nhermeneutics is the concern that the success of the scientific method\nhas alienated us from the validity of the truth at issue in\ninterpretive experience. Philosophical hermeneutics therefore begins\nwith an attempt to recover the sense of truth at issue in interpretive\nexperience by focusing our attention on motifs from the tradition of\nhumanism and on the ontology of art. Gadamer\u2019s considerations of\nmotifs from the tradition of humanism are oriented by Weimar\nclassicism and its legacy in nineteenth-century German intellectual\nlife. His account helps us to recover the validity of an experience of\ntruth that is not measured by scientific method but that, instead,\ndepends on our education, grasped as formation (Bildung)\nthrough formal education and experience, as well as the concordant\ncultivation of capacities, such as common sense\n(sensus communis), judgment, and taste (Gadamer,\nTruth and Method, Part I.1.B).\n\nGadamer\u2019s philosophical hermeneutics upholds that the primary\nexample of the hermeneutical experience of truth is found in our\nencounters with art. Gadamer believes this becomes clear once we\novercome modern assumptions about the subjectivity of aesthetic\nexperience, in which the being of art is reduced to that of an\nimmediately present object that, in turn, has the property of\nproducing affects, such as aesthetic pleasure, in a subject. In his\nhermeneutics, by contrast, the being of art is rather a matter of a\nrealization or \u201cenactment\u201d (Vollzug) that we\nparticipate in (Gadamer, Truth and Method, 103). The\nexperience of an artwork unfolds as an event of interpretation that,\nwhen it is a success, allows us to recognize something that purports\nor claims to be true.\n\nIn Gadamer\u2019s philosophical hermeneutics, the treatment of the\nexperience of art is expansive, but a synopsis of his definitive\nformulation from Truth and Method is instructive. Gadamer,\nfirst, introduces the theme of \u2018play,\u2019 or, of the\n\u2018game\u2019 (Spiel) to emphasize that the experience\nof art is an event of interpretation that exceeds the subjective\nintentions or interests of those involved in it (Gadamer, Truth\nand Method, Part I.II.1.A). Insofar as we agree to play a game,\nwe give ourselves over to the context of meaning that comprises the\ngame. We allow ourselves to be oriented by the norms that govern, and\nthus enable but never determine, thoughts and actions appropriate to\nthe playing of the game. Likewise, when we participate in an\nexperience of an artwork, we give ourselves over to the context of\nmeaning that comprises the work, and, thus, allow our interpretive\nexperience to be governed by the limits and possibilities of\ninterpretation appropriate to the work. When we experience a\nperformance of Athol Fugard, John Kani, and Winston Ntshona\u2019s\nThe Island, for example, we allow our interpretive experience\nto be governed by limits and possibilities of interpretation that have\nto do with apartheid-era South Africa, Robben Island Prison, and\nparallels with Sophocles\u2019 Antigone.\n\nGadamer maintains that in our experience of art, such play culminates\nin what he calls \u2018transformation into structure.\u2019 By this,\nhe means that our experience of art comes to be that of a work,\ngrasped in its \u2018ideality\u2019 or meaningfulness, in\ndistinction from the activities involved in its presentation (such as\nthe activity of actors presenting a drama). With our experience of\nsuch a \u2018transformation into structure,\u2019 the work of art\nallows us to recognize something as true (Gadamer, Truth and\nMethod, Part I.II.1.B). He describes this interpretive experience\nof truth as a process of mediation, by which a claim of truth at issue\nin an artwork comes into view through the repeated projection and\nsupersession of inadequate interpretations, until such mediation\nbecomes sufficient, or \u2018total.\u2019 There is, as anyone who\nhas experienced an artwork will confirm, no method to ensure the\nsuccess of this process of repeated projection and supersession; it\ndepends on the quality of our interpretive work, and, this quality can\nbe enlarged by our formation of our capacities such as common sense,\njudgment, and taste.\n4.2 Tradition and Prejudice\n\nGadamer\u2019s philosophical hermeneutics proceeds on the basis of\nthese considerations of humanism and art as an attempt to establish\nthe essential elements of the hermeneutical experience of\n truth.[5]\n In this, the hermeneutical experience of truth is conditioned by\ntradition and language.\n\nThe claim that the hermeneutical experience of truth is conditioned by\ntradition is not reducible to historicism or the historicist project\nof determining, say, what an artist or an author took to be\ntrue through a reconstruction of the historical context of the\nartwork or text under consideration. Quite to the contrary, the\nhermeneutical experience of truth concerns something that holds true\nfor our own existence. Rather, then, the hermeneutical experience of\ntruth is conditioned by tradition in the sense that it is limited and\nmade possible by the historical transmission of meaning. The claim\nthat the hermeneutical experience of truth is conditioned by tradition\nstresses the sense of the etymological origins of the word\n\u2018tradition\u2019 in the Latin tr\u0101diti\u014dn-\n(stem of tr\u0101diti\u014d), a handing over, delivery or\nhanding down of knowledge (OED 2020, \u201ctradition,\nn.\u201d). This claim also stresses the sense of Gadamer\u2019s\nGerman term for tradition, \u00dcberlieferung, which,\ntranslated literally, means a \u2018delivering over.\u2019 In this,\nthe hermeneutical experience of truth involves belonging to a\nhistorical tradition. Contrary to a common misconception of Gadamerian\nphilosophical hermeneutics, traditions are not monoliths. Traditions\nare more like processes\u2014idiomatic, dynamic, and\nevolving\u2014that, to borrow from Whitman, \u201ccontain\nmultitudes\u201d (Whitman, Song of Myself, Sec. 51).\nAccordingly, to belong to a tradition is not first to possess an\nidentity derived from a cultural or ethnic heritage; it is, rather, to\nbe a participant in a movement of handing down, delivering over.\n\nIn Gadamer\u2019s philosophical hermeneutics, the\nhermeneutical experience of truth, as conditioned by tradition, is\nthus a matter of prejudice. Gadamer clarifies the meaning of\n\u2018prejudice\u2019 in reference to the early Heidegger. Gadamer\nagrees with Heidegger that human existence is characterized by\nfacticity, so that understanding, or, our projection of possibilities,\nis oriented by \u2018pre-structures\u2019 that are a matter of thrownness. Yet, such \u2018pre-structures\u2019 are best described\nas \u2018prejudices\u2019 because they concern more than the\nindividual situations that comprise our existence. These\n\u2018pre-structures\u2019 are shaped by the larger context of\nhistorically inherited meanings that remain operative, or, in effect,\nin such situations of our individual existence in the first place\n(Gadamer, Truth and Method, Part II.II.1.A).\n\nTradition, so conceived, proves to be a legitimate source of authority\nfor the hermeneutical experience of truth. Gadamer\u2019s\nphilosophical hermeneutics thus comprises a counterpoint to the\nrejection of the authority of tradition in modern science. Gadamer\nassociates this rejection above all with the \u201cprejudice against\nprejudice\u201d developed in the European Enlightenment (Gadamer,\nTruth and Method, 270). In this, the motto of the\nEnlightenment is that we should think for ourselves, basing our\nbeliefs in our own use of reason and not the authority of tradition,\nwhether this authority is conceived in terms of superstition,\nreligious or aristocratic rule, or custom. Gadamer recognizes that the\nEnlightenment charge to think for ourselves is legitimate, but he does\nnot believe it follows from this that tradition cannot be a source of\ntruth. He writes,\n\nThe Enlightenment\u2019s distinction between faith in authority and\nusing one\u2019s own reason is, in itself, legitimate. If the\nprestige of authority displaces one\u2019s own judgment, then\nauthority is in fact a source of prejudices. But this does not\npreclude its being a source of truth, and that is what the\nEnlightenment failed to see when it denigrated all authority\n(Gadamer, Truth and Method, 279).\n\nIn Gadamer\u2019s philosophical hermeneutics, the experience of truth\ndoes not demand that we liberate ourselves from the authority of\ntradition, but, on the contrary, recognizes tradition as a possible\nsource of our claims of truth. To be sure, tradition is not therefore\na foundation of claims to truth. Tradition is, after all, a process of\ntransmission, which is ultimately \u201cungroundable\u201d and\n\u201cunderivable\u201d (Gadamer, Truth and Method, 254,\ntranslation\n modified).[6]\n Yet, even if it is not a foundation, tradition is a legitimate\ninterpretive wellspring, in the sense that it makes possible and\nshapes all understanding.\n4.3 Normative Implications\n\nThe hermeneutical experience of truth is, therefore, governed by the\n\u201cprinciple of history of effect\u201d (Gadamer, Truth and\nMethod, Part II.II.B.iv). This means that our attempts to\nunderstand are always guided more by tradition, and thus prejudice,\nthan we are able to make explicit to ourselves. This principle, as\nGadamer maintains, has important normative implications for\ninterpretive experience. These implications follow from the fact that\nit is impossible to become completely self-conscious of the prejudices\noperative in our attempts to understand. As Gadamer puts the point in\nan ontological register, \u201cto be historically means that\nknowledge of oneself can never be complete\u201d (Gadamer,\nTruth and Method, 302). Because of this, the experience of\ntruth leads not to self-certainty, but to the insight that we should\nproceed always with a Delphic self-knowledge of our limits.\n\nSuch Delphic self-knowledge should carry over to our assessment of\nknowledge secured by modern science, as well. For, as Gadamer puts the\npoint, \u201cwhen a na\u00efve faith in scientific method denies the\nexistence of effective history, there can be an actual deformation of\nknowledge\u201d (Gadamer, Truth and Method, 301). This is\nevident first of all from the humanistic study of the history of\nscience. After all, knowledge based on the best results of science\ntoday may well have the same fate as the discredited scientific\nknowledge of past times. It is also evident that we should carry over\nDelphic self-knowledge to our assessment of scientific knowledge from\nthe fact that scientific inquiry is always guided by more prejudice\nthan can be kept in check by any method: for example, in the selection\nof research questions, in hypothesis formation, and in any number of\nmetaphysical (or other) assumptions tacitly or unconsciously used to\ncharacterize objects of inquiry.\n\nGadamer maintains that the normative implications of the\n\u2018principle of history of effect\u2019 mean that in our\ninterpretive experience, we should attempt always to expand our\nhorizons. By horizon, Gadamer has in mind the \u201crange\u201d of\nour capacity to understand (Gadamer, Truth and Method, 302),\nas this is made possible and limited by the breadth and depth of what\nwe have already come to understand in our lives. In this concept of\nhorizon, it is not difficult to hear the echo of the humanistic\nsensibility that interpretive experience is educative. Our\nhorizon is the formation we have achieved through our interpretive\nexperience, both from our formal education and from our\nlife-experience. Thus, the normative demand of interpretive experience\nis always to become more educated.\n\nGadamer describes the expansion of our horizons as a \u201cfusion of\nhorizons\u201d (Gadamer, Truth and Method, 306). This term\nis perhaps misleading, however, because it can be mistaken to signify\nthat an interpreter has a distinct \u2018horizon\u2019 that is then\nexpanded through the assimilation of another distinct horizon, say,\nthat of a text we are interpreting. Really, though, what Gadamer means\nis that in interpretive experience, our attempts to understand can and\nshould lead us to recognize that our own horizon is not as insular or\nnarrow as we first thought. Rather, we can and should come to\nrecognize that our horizon belongs to a larger context of the\nhistorical transmission of meaning, so that when we come to understand\nsomething, we are thereby raised \u201cto a higher level of\nuniversality that overcomes not only our own particularity but also\nthat of the other\u201d (Gadamer, Truth and Method, 305). In\nthis, \u2018fusion\u2019 signifies something closer to the verbal\nform of Gadamer\u2019s Verschmelzung, that is\nverschmeltzen, to melt together. We expand our horizons\nthrough interpretive experience that melts away at the rigidity of our\nhorizon, so that we can see how it melts into and mixes with a larger\nmovement of transmission.\n4.4 Language\n\nThe hermeneutical experience of truth is conditioned by not only\ntradition but also language. In Gadamer\u2019s philosophical\nhermeneutics, the relation of truth to language is described in\nreference to being. Gadamer expresses this relation in a celebrated\nmotto, \u201cbeing that can be understood is language\u201d\n(Gadamer, Truth and Method,\n 474).[7]\n According to this motto, language is primarily a\n\u2018medium\u2019 that shows us the being, or meaningful order, of\nthe world and the things we encounter in it (Gadamer, Truth and\nMethod, Part\n III.1).[8]\n Thus, language is only secondarily an instrument that we use, among\nother things, to represent something, communicate about it, or make\nassertions about it. The experience of language as a medium takes\nplace in what Gadamer calls \u201chermeneutical\nconversation\u201d (Gadamer, Truth and Method, 388).\nThe primary example of such hermeneutical conversation is a\nconversation between interlocutors about something; but, he believes\nthat hermeneutical conversation also includes all interpretive\nexperience, so that the interpretation of artworks and texts is\nconceived as a conversation between the interpreter and work about the\nsubject matter of the work. In hermeneutical conversation,\ninterlocutors may, of course, use language to represent, communicate\nor make assertions. More originally, however, hermeneutical\nconversation concerns the being of the matter under consideration.\nHermeneutical conversation is thus an event of interlocution that aims\nto show something in its being, as it genuinely or truly is.\n\nThe hermeneutical experience of truth can be described as the success\nof conversation so conceived. But, in this, truth is not experienced\nas a matter of \u201ccorrectness,\u201d or as this may be clarified,\na matter of correct predication (Gadamer, Truth and Method,\n406). In the experience of truth as correct predication, truth is\ntypically conceived as the property of a proposition, statement or\nutterance that suitably connects a subject with a predicate. In the\nhermeneutical experience of truth, by contrast, the concern is not\nwith predication, that is, the connection of a subject with a\npredicate, but, instead, with conversation, grasped as an event of\ninterlocution concerned with the being of a subject itself. In such a\nconversation, truth is reached, if it is reached, not when a subject\nis suitably connected with something else, but, instead, when the\nsubject is sufficiently shown in its own being, as it truly is. The\nmeasure of such sufficiency is established not in advance, but is\nachieved in the course of conversation along with the claim of truth\nthat it measures.\n\nPhilosophical hermeneutics maintains that the experience of truth as\ncorrect predication is dependent on the hermeneutical experience of\ntruth. This is because in truth as correctness, the proper connection\nof subject and predicate depends in part on the being of the subject. In\npredication, the being of the subject is typically either left out of\naccount or is presumed already to be determined or interpreted. But,\nthe being of the subject\u2014what it truly is\u2014is a matter of\ninterpretation. In illustration, we may consider the fictional\nconversation presented by Plato in the Republic among\nSocrates, Glaucon and other interlocutors about justice. In conclusion\nof our interpretive experience, we may assert the proposition,\n\u2018justice is nearly impossible to achieve!\u2019 But, whether\nthis is so will depend on the being of justice, and the truth of the\nbeing of justice will depend, in turn, on an interpretation of it,\nwhether we derive it from Plato\u2019s text or otherwise. Truth as\ncorrectness, then, depends on the hermeneutical experience of truth,\nand such truth, in turn, is a matter of interpretation.\n\nFinally, in Gadamer\u2019s philosophical hermeneutics, it is claimed\nthat the hermeneutical experience of truth is \u2018universal.\u2019\nThis does not mean that the hermeneutical experience of truth takes\nplace every time we converse about something. Rather, it means that\nthe hermeneutical experience of truth remains always a problem,\nwhenever we wish to understand something, and even when a conversation\nculminates in an experience of truth. Each hermeneutical experience of\ntruth remains open to further interpretation (see Gadamer, \u201cThe\nUniversality of the Hermeneutical Problem\u201d).\n5. Symbol, Metaphor, and Narrative\n\nContemporary hermeneutics receives further contour from Paul\nRicoeur\u2019s considerations of language, and especially of\nlinguistic forms such as symbolism, metaphor, and narrative. Ricoeur\ntakes orientation from the claim of the early Heidegger\u2019s\nhermeneutical phenomenology that self-understanding is, in the end, to\nbe grasped in ontological terms: self-understanding is the\nself-interpretation of human existence, grasped as the enactment of\nthe distinctive possibility of such existence. Ricoeur, however,\nproposes a hermeneutical phenomenology that, as he puts it in an\nimportant early essay, \u2018grafts\u2019 hermeneutics to\nphenomenology in a different manner than Heidegger proposes (Ricoeur,\n\u201cExistence and Hermeneutics,\u201d 6). Heidegger believes that\nfor the self-interpretation of human existence, the interpretations of\nthe human condition found in the human sciences are derivative; what\nis called for is an analysis of the sense of being, or, the structures,\nof human existence as these are disclosed through our own individual\nbeing in the world. Ricoeur criticizes Heidegger\u2019s proposal as a\n\u201cshort route,\u201d or perhaps better, short cut, that bypasses\nthe significance for our self-interpretation of the multiple and even\nconflicting interpretations of the human condition found in other\ndisciplines and areas of philosophy (Ricoeur, \u201cExistence and\nHermeneutics,\u201d 6). He proposes, instead, a hermeneutical\nphenomenology that embraces a \u201clong route\u201d of\nself-interpretation, one that is mediated by passing through\nhermeneutical considerations of these multiple and conflicting\ninterpretations (Ricoeur, \u201cExistence and Hermeneutics,\u201d\n6).\n\nRicoeur\u2019s contributions are notoriously difficult to reduce to a\nspecific position or otherwise categorize, in part because he\npracticed what he preached. In his career, his route to\nself-understanding was influenced by reflexive philosophy, Husserl and\nHeidegger, French structuralism, as well as by contemporary\nAnglo-American philosophy (see Ricoeur \u201cOn\nInterpretation,\u201d 12\u201315). Moreover, his inquiries range\nover topics in areas as diverse as religion, anthropology, psychology,\nhistory, and literature. His contributions to hermeneutics are perhaps\nespecially characterized, however, by the concern for possibilities of\nthe mediating role of language to establish critical distance in\ninterpretive experience and by his focus on the significance of\ninterpretive experience for ethical and political agency.\n\nIn an early formulation of what he has in mind by the hermeneutical\n\u2018long route\u2019 to self-understanding, Ricoeur maintains that\nthe pursuit of self-understanding has to be mediated by hermeneutical\nconsiderations of semantic structures of interpretation that are\ncommon to research across the human sciences (Ricoeur,\n\u201cExistence and Hermeneutics,\u201d 11). In this,\nRicoeur\u2019s approach is \u201corganized around the central theme\nof meaning with multiple or multivocal senses\u2026\u201d or, what\nhe calls \u201csymbolic senses\u201d (Ricoeur, \u201cExistence\nand Hermeneutics,\u201d 11). This involves a novel conception of\ninterpretation itself. Traditionally in hermeneutics, the purpose of\ninterpretation is thought of as making apparent the single, unitary\nmeaning of something. Ricoeur, by contrast, stresses that the aim of\ninterpretation also includes making apparent the plurality of meanings\nat issue in a speech act or text. He writes,\n\u201cInterpretation\u2026is the work of thought which consists in\ndeciphering the hidden meaning in the apparent meaning, in unfolding\nlevels of meaning implied in the literal meaning\u201d (Ricoeur,\n\u201cExistence and Hermeneutics,\u201d 13).\n\nRicoeur explains that the itinerary of the hermeneutical long route to\nself-understanding passes through an analysis of a broad range of\nsymbolic forms, such as the \u201ccosmic\u201d symbolism revealed by\nthe phenomenology of religion, the symbolic character of\n\u201cdesire\u201d revealed by psychoanalysis, and the symbolic\nforms revealed by the study of literature and the arts (Ricoeur,\n\u201cExistence and Hermeneutics,\u201d 13). In his Freud and\nPhilosophy: An Essay on Interpretation, Ricoeur describes Freud,\nalong with Nietzsche and Marx, as a master of the \u2018hermeneutics\nof suspicion.\u2019 In this, interpretation, as a \u2018deciphering\nof hidden meaning in the apparent meaning,\u2019 takes on a critical\nfunction through the exposure of repressed or distorted meaning that\nlies beneath the surface of commonly accepted meaning.\n\nLater in his career, Ricoeur\u2019s considerations of the\nhermeneutical long route to self-understanding shift attention from a\nsemantics of symbols to considerations of metaphor and especially\nnarrative. Ricoeur\u2019s considerations of metaphor build from the\nclaim that metaphor should be grasped not first as the substitution of\none conventional name for a different one, but, instead, as a\n\u201cpeculiar predication,\u201d one \u201cconsisting in the\nattribution to logical subjects of predicates that are incompossible\nwith them\u201d (Ricoeur, \u201cOn Interpretation,\u201d 8).\nCrucial for Ricoeur is that metaphorical predication thus not only\nconcerns what Frege called \u2018sense\u2019 but also\n\u2018reference.\u2019 Metaphors are linguistic innovations that\nallow us to refer to aspects of reality for which words are otherwise\nunavailable (Ricoeur, \u201cOn Interpretation,\u201d 10).\n\nRicoeur maintains that narrative, too, concerns both sense and\nreference, but on a different scale. By narrative, he has in mind\n\u201cthe diverse forms and modes of the game of storytelling\u201d\n(Ricoeur, \u201cOn Interpretation,\u201d 2) and in his three-volume\ntreatise Time and Narrative, he focuses on the role of\nnarrative not only in literary fiction but also in the recounting of\nhistory. He argues that while there are a diversity of forms and modes\nof narrative, all narratives nevertheless perform a common function,\nnamely, they mark, organize, and clarify temporal experience (Ricoeur,\n\u201cOn Interpretation,\u201d 2). In this, he claims that in\nnarrative the work of such schematization of temporal experience is\nachieved by the composition of the plot, or, emplotment. Through\nnarrative emplotment, we make apparent the meaning of persons,\nrelations, and events that comprise human affairs\u2014say, in\nfiction, those that can happen, and in history, those that have\nhappened. Crucial for Ricoeur is that narrative emplotment is\nreferential; as he makes the point in regard to fiction, \u201cthe\nplots we invent help us to shape our confused, formless, and in the\nlast resort mute temporal experience\u201d (Ricoeur, \u201cOn\nInterpretation,\u201d 6).\n\nRicoeur maintains, however, that the referential function of narrative\nis not simply to assert something about the world but has implications\nfor ethical and political life. In fiction, narrative emplotment not\nonly helps us evaluate the meaning of human actions, but, moreover,\ncontributes to the creation of \u201cthe horizon of a new relating\nthat we may call a world\u201d (Ricoeur, \u201cOn\nInterpretation,\u201d 10; see also Ricoeur, \u201cImagination in\nDiscourse and Action\u201d). In so doing, fiction refers to\npossibilities of reality that can orient our agency and contribute to\nour efforts to reshape reality.\n6. Philosophical Controversies\n\nThe development of hermeneutics since Gadamer forwarded his\n\u2018philosophical hermeneutics\u2019 in Truth and Method\nhas been fostered by philosophical controversies about the\nconsequences of his project. The most significant of these\ncontroversies are about the consequences of philosophical hermeneutics\nin relation to critical theory and to\n deconstruction.[9]\n Although philosophical interest in these controversies is extensive,\nin each case, discussion arises in close connection with Gadamer\nhimself. In the case of the controversy in relation to critical\ntheory, discussion originates between J\u00fcrgen Habermas and Gadamer\nover the problem of critique, or, more specifically, the critique of\nideology. In the case of the controversy in relation to\ndeconstruction, discussion originates between Jacques Derrida and\nGadamer. While this discussion is itself layered and gives rise to new\nquestions over time, it concerns, in part, the question of whether the\nsuccess of understanding genuinely achieves a determination of\nmeaning.\n\nGadamer\u2019s engagements with Habermas and Derrida themselves are\nsometimes hailed as examples, or perhaps case studies, of his own\nconception of hermeneutical conversation. Gadamer has claimed that\nsuch conversation proceeds always from \u201crecognizing in advance\nthe possibility that your partner is right, even recognizing the\npossible superiority of your partner\u201d (Gadamer,\n\u201cReflections on My Philosophical Journey,\u201d 36). Gadamer\nfamously puts this belief into practice in his discussions with both\nHabermas and Derrida, and the legacy of these debates plays an\nimportant role in Gadamer\u2019s subsequent thinking.\n6.1 Hermeneutics and Critical Theory\n\nOne important controversy about the consequences of Gadamer\u2019s\nphilosophical hermeneutics, then, concerns whether it offers a basis\nfor the critique of ideology. This concern is raised with emphasis by\nthe critical theorist J\u00fcrgen Habermas. Habermas, building on\nHegel, Marx and Engels, as well as his original theory of recognition\nand communication, maintains that an ideology is a nexus of political\ndoctrines, beliefs, and attitudes that distort the political realities\nthey purport to describe. Accordingly, ideologies reinforce equally\ndistorted power relations that, in turn, prevent the openness of\ndiscussion that is necessary for legitimate democratic political\ndeliberation and decision-making (see Sypnowich 2019, Sec. 2). In view of\nthis, one purpose of critical theory is to establish a basis to\ncritique ideology. Habermas and other critical theorists sought a\nbasis of critique with the ability to expose even some of our most\ncherished political doctrines, beliefs, and attitudes as ideological\ndistortions that result from forms of domination passed down from\ntradition.\n\nHabermas raises the objection against Gadamer\u2019s philosophical\nhermeneutics that the hermeneutical experience of truth offers too\nlittle basis for such critique (see Habermas, \u201cThe Universality\nClaim of\n Hermeneutics\u201d).[10]\n Habermas raises the objection that philosophical hermeneutics, with\nits adherence to the authority of tradition, leaves no room for the\ncritique of ideologies entrenched in the historically transmitted\nprejudices on which our experience of truth relies. Moreover, as we\nmight accordingly worry, what Gadamer describes as the hermeneutical\nexperience of truth might not be an experience of truth at all, but,\nrather, a distorted communication that is complicit in ideology, since\nthe so-called truth results from a conversation that might not be\nopen, but oriented by prejudices that reinforce relations of\ndomination.\n\nWhile the influence of Habermas\u2019s objection is extensive,\nGadamer has mounted rejoinders on behalf of his philosophical\nhermeneutics (see \u201cReply to My Critics\u201d; see also\n\u201cWhat is Practice? The Conditions of Social Reason\u201d). The\nthrust of Gadamer\u2019s argument is, first, that it is actually\nHabermas\u2019s position, not his own, that remains uncritical, since\nit is na\u00efve to believe in the possibility of a basis of critique\nthat is somehow not subject to the authority of tradition. And,\nGadamer stresses, second, that the hermeneutical experience of truth\nis no blind acceptance of the authority of tradition. Rather, as he\nargues, interpretive experience remains critical, in that such\nexperience unfolds precisely though the questioning of our prejudices,\nand judgment about what aspects of our prejudices remain valid and\nwhich have become invalid for matters of concern to us now.\n6.2 Hermeneutics and Deconstruction\n\nA further important controversy about the consequences of\nGadamer\u2019s philosophical hermeneutics arises in the context of\nDerrida\u2019s project of deconstruction. While the relation between\nhermeneutics and deconstruction is complex, pivotal for the\ncontroversy is whether the success of understanding really achieves a\ndeterminate meaning. Gadamer, as we have seen, maintains that the\nsuccess of understanding is to understand something in its being, as\nit genuinely or truly is. Moreover, we experience such a truth as a\nclaim, one that we can agree or disagree with, and that purports to be\njustified by the interpretive experience which first gives rise to it.\nYet, as we may now observe, Gadamer\u2019s notion of the success of\nunderstanding thereby trusts in the authenticity of our own experience\nthat we really have come to understand something determinate, or, in\nany case, determinate enough that it makes a claim of truth.\nDerrida\u2019s deconstruction poses a challenge to this idea because\nDerrida argues that discursive experience is governed by an\noperation\u2014or, perhaps better, a structure of\ninoperativity\u2014that would preclude the possibility of\nunderstanding something with such determinacy (see Lawlor 2019).\n\nDerrida clarifies the character of this structure of inoperativity in\nterms of a number of concepts over the course of his career, but\nperhaps none are more influential than that of\n\u201cdiff\u00e9rance\u201d (see Derrida,\n\u201cDiff\u00e9rance\u201d). Derrida describes\ndiff\u00e9rance as a twofold structure of difference and\ndeferral. Building on terms from Saussure\u2019s linguistics,\ndiff\u00e9rance thus indicates, first of all, that in\ndiscursive experience, determining the meaning of\nsomething remains beyond our reach because linguistic signs\npresent what they are supposed to signify never per se but\nalways only heterogeneously through signifiers. And\ndiff\u00e9rance indicates, furthermore, that since this\nheterogeneity cannot be superseded, our attempts to determine the\nmeaning of something remain interminably in deferral (Derrida,\n\u201cDiff\u00e9rance\u201d). Because discursive experience is\nthus imbued with heterogeneity, our attempts to determine the meaning\nof something are not fully under our control but, instead, remain\nsubject to a free play of signs (see Derrida,\n\u201cDiff\u00e9rance,\u201d \u201cStructure, Sign and\nPlay\u201d).\n\nDerrida\u2019s deconstruction poses a challenge to Gadamer\u2019s\nnotion of the success of understanding as a hermeneutical experience\nof truth. Gadamer, as we have said, trusts that our experience of\ntruth really involves a determinate claim. Derrida\u2019s\nconsiderations suggest, however, that such trust is misplaced. If, in\nthe success of understanding, our experience purports to involve a\ndeterminate claim to truth, then our experience of this determinacy\nmust be misguided, since the possibility of determinacy is precluded\nin advance by diff\u00e9rance. As Derrida puts the point\nduring the 1981 initial meeting with Gadamer, \u201cI am not\nconvinced that we ever really have this experience that Professor\nGadamer describes, of knowing in a dialogue that one has been\nperfectly understood or experiencing the success of\nconfirmation\u201d (Derrida, \u201cThree Questions to Hans-Georg\nGadamer,\u201d 54). Indeed, in an important early essay, Derrida\nmaintains that the pursuit of success of such a kind is not merely\nmisguided, but a symptom of our suppression, perhaps repression, of an\nanxiety about the insuperable role of heterogeneity involved in all\ninterpretive experience (Derrida, \u201cStructure Sign and\nPlay,\u201d 292).\n\nGadamer takes up the challenge posed by Derrida\u2019s deconstruction\nnot primarily as an objection to his hermeneutics but, instead, as an\nimpetus to dedicate renewed attention to the role played by difference\nin interpretive experience. After all, even though philosophical\nhermeneutics does not involve the technical notion of\ndiff\u00e9rance, Gadamer\u2019s hermeneutics makes space\nfor difference in important regards. First, Gadamer certainly\nrecognizes that every determinate claim of truth remains open to\nfurther interpretation. And, second, he recognizes that the\nhermeneutical experience of a determine claim of truth is itself a\nlegacy of difference, since interpretive experience unfolds in the\nfree play of conversation. Gadamer\u2019s response to the challenge\nposed by deconstruction unfolds in attempts to expand and deepen these\nand related considerations of the role played by difference in\ninterpretive experience. Gadamer develops this response in a number of\nessays, and is led to develop hermeneutical considerations of a number\nof themes brought into focus by his encounter with Derrida, such as\nthe significance of what he calls the eminent text (see for example\nGadamer, \u201cHermeneutics Tracking the Trace,\u201d and\n\u201cText and Interpretation\u201d). Matters of central concern for\nthe philosophical controversy between hermeneutics and deconstruction\nhave also been further developed by several philosophers associated\nwith hermeneutics, such as John Caputo (1987), James Risser (1997),\nDonatella di Cesare (2003) and others.\n7. Postmodern Hermeneutics\n\nThe rise of postmodernism has proved to be an important impetus for\ndevelopments within hermeneutics. While \u2018postmodernism\u2019\nsignifies a number of things, of particular influence in philosophy is\nJean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard\u2019s definition of postmodernism as an\n\u201cincredulity toward metanarratives\u201d (Lyotard,\nPostmodern Condition, xxiv). By \u2018metanarrative,\u2019\nLyotard has in mind foundational stories of modern Western philosophy,\nespecially, as these foundational stories function to legitimate\ndiscourses in the sciences (Lyotard, Postmodern Condition,\n34). Examples of metanarratives include, say, stories about the\nobjectivity of science and the contribution that science makes to the\nbetterment of society.\n\nLyotard sees both a danger and a possibility in the postmodern\nrejection of metanarratives. Lyotard maintains that postmodern\nincredulity toward metanarratives has resulted, first, in the\nincreased danger that our valuation of knowledge will be reduced to\none, totalizing standard, namely, that of an \u201cinformation\ncommodity\u201d produced and exchanged for the accumulation of wealth\nand power (Lyotard, Postmodern Condition, 5). But, he\nbelieves, the postmodern incredulity toward metanarratives has\nresulted in a new possibility, too, of liberating the creation of\nnarrative meaning from the need to establish legitimating foundations.\nPhilosophers of postmodernism have sought to clarify such a postmodern\npossibility for the creation of meaning through the development of\nhermeneutics (see Vattimo, Beyond Interpretation, Gary\nMadison 1989, John D. Caputo 1987, 2018; for a creative intervention\nin postmodern hermeneutics, see Davey 2006). In this, hermeneutics\nplaces stress on the possibility of interpretive experience to produce\nnew meaning and shifts away from concerns about truth and\nexistence.\n\nProbably the most influential conception of postmodern hermeneutics is\nembodied in Gianni Vattimo\u2019s notion of \u2018weak\nthought.\u2019 Vattimo\u2019s hermeneutics is influenced not only by\nfigures such as Gadamer and Heidegger, but also Nietzsche, as well as\nthe important Italian philosopher Luigi Pareyson (see Benso, 2018). By\n\u2018weak thought,\u2019 Vattimo has in mind interpretive practices\nthat incrementally diminish the efficacy of narratives about the\npurported \u2018being\u2019 of things that have been passed down\nfrom the tradition of Western metaphysics. Vattimo embraces the\npostmodern possibility to liberate the creation of meaning from any\nneeds for foundation or legitimacy. Building on Heidegger and\nNietzsche, Vattimo argues that despite all postmodern incredulity,\nnarratives passed down about the purported \u2018being\u2019 of\nthings continue to be in effect, often tacitly, in a broad range of\nour current beliefs and practices. What is then called for are\ninterpretive practices that loosen the hold of these narratives, and\nthus expose that what they have to say about the \u2018being\u2019\nof things are not eternal verities but, instead, mockups that are\nsubject to interpretive revision. Vattimo, then, defines interpretive\nexperience not in Gadamerian terms of a conversation that brings\nsomething into focus in its being, as it genuinely is. Rather, he\nconceives of interpretive experience as a practice of recovery, even\nconvalescence (Verwindung), that weakens the effects of\ninterpretations of \u2018being\u2019 passed down from Western\nmetaphysics. Indeed, Vattimo associates the possibility to liberate\nmeaning through weak thought as the pursuit of what he calls\n\u2018accomplished nihilism,\u2019 in that weak thought seeks to\nunmask every sense of \u2018being\u2019 which purports to be more\nthan the result of an interpretation (see Vattimo, Beyond\nInterpretation, The End of Modernity).\n8. Further Developments\n\nResearch in hermeneutics is perhaps more diverse now than at any other\nperiod in the historical movement, and has also begun to expand\ninterest in hermeneutical considerations to contexts such as feminist\nphilosophy (see Warnke 2015), comparative philosophy (see, for\nexample, Nelson 2017), philosophy of embodiment (see, for example,\nKearney 2015), and Latin American philosophy (see, for example, Vallega\n2019). While it is impossible to gather all directions of current\nresearch in a short article, some further developments have received\nparticular attention.\n8.1 Hermeneutics in Anglo-American Philosophy\n\nHermeneutics, grasped as a historical movement, is typically\nassociated with continental European traditions of thought and the\nreception of these traditions in the global context. This reception\nhas included contributions to the development of hermeneutics made by\nnoteworthy Anglo-American philosophers. Hermeneutics has been adopted\nby Richard Rorty, has been connected with the later Wittgenstein and\nDavidson, and has also been taken up by philosophers associated with\nthe so-called \u2018Pittsburgh school,\u2019 Robert Brandom, and\nJohn\n McDowell.[11]\n\nRorty, in his now classic Philosophy and the Mirror of\nNature, presents a ranging critique of modern philosophy that\nfocuses on epistemology, especially the idea that knowledge is a\nrepresentation or mental \u2018mirroring\u2019 of mind-independent\nreality. Against epistemology, Rorty proposes hermeneutics, which he\ncharacterizes as \u201can expression of hope that the cultural space\nleft behind by the demise of epistemology will not be\nfilled\u2026\u201d (Rorty 1979, 315). Hermeneutics holds this void\nopen with what he calls \u2018conversation.\u2019 In this,\nconversation pursues not the truth, conceived as a correspondence of\nmind and mind-independent reality, but, instead, edification (Rorty\n1979, 318, 360, 378). Edification, itself Rorty\u2019s proposed\ntranslation of the German Bildung (Piercy 2016, 447) concerns\nnot truth, then, but instead the discovery of new and useful\npossibilities.\n\nPhilosophers associated with the University of Pittsburgh have also\ntaken up and developed themes in hermeneutics. Robert Brandom, for his\npart, has argued that his inferentialist approach in semantics is able\nto support major tenets of Gadamerian hermeneutics, thereby suggesting\nthat the traditions of inferentialism and hermeneutics can complement\none another (see Brandom 2002 and 2004; see also Lafont 2007). John\nMcDowell, in his Mind and World, also introduces a notion\nconnected with hermeneutics. In this text, McDowell wishes to resolve\nthe question of how the mind, ultimately, in the\n\u2018spontaneity\u2019 or freedom of reason, relates to the world.\nHe argues that the question itself is a symptom of naturalism, the\nidea typical of modern science that immutable laws govern everything\nin nature. In this, the worry about the place of the spontaneity of\nreason in nature arises precisely from our reductive conception of\nnature in the first place. McDowell resolves the question of the\nrelation of reason and nature, then, through the proposal of an\nalternative naturalism, one that treats reason as a \u2018second\nnature,\u2019 or, a process of the realization of potentials.\nMcDowell draws on notions of tradition and formation\n(Bildung) in order to clarify this second nature. He writes,\n\u201chuman beings are intelligibly initiated into this stretch of\nthe space of reasons by ethical upbringing, which instills the\nappropriate shape to their lives. The resulting habits of thought and\naction are second nature\u201d (McDowell 1994, 84).\n\nIt is an open question how consistent Rorty\u2019s, McDowell\u2019s\nand Brandom\u2019s reactions to hermeneutics are with views developed\nwithin the historical movement of\n hermeneutics.[12]\n Still, Rorty\u2019s and McDowell\u2019s respective critical stances\ntoward modern epistemology and science, their novel uses of the\nconcept of formation (Bildung), as well as Rorty\u2019s\nnovel use of the concept of conversation, place them in a productive\nexchange with continental philosophical scholars on themes more\ncustomarily associated with nineteenth- and twentieth-century German\nphilosophy generally as well as with the historical movement of\nhermeneutics. Moreover, Rorty\u2019s turn to edification and the\ndiscovery of novel possibilities it affords as an alternative to the\npursuit of truth places him in proximity to postmodern hermeneutics,\nin\n particular.[13]\n8.2 Hermeneutics in Ethical and Political Philosophy\n\nHermeneutics, since Heidegger at least, claims a special affinity with\npractical philosophy. Both Heidegger and Gadamer, for example, uphold\nAristotle\u2019s ethics as an important source for their respective\napproaches to interpretive\n experience.[14]\n Gadamer, in particular, develops the implications of his hermeneutics\nfor practical life. Although Gadamer provides no systematic ethical or\npolitical theory, he maintains the significance of interpretive\nexperience as a counter to the alienation produced in modern,\nbureaucratically managed society, he develops a hermeneutical approach\nto the ethical significance of friendship as well as a related\napproach to political solidarity (see Gadamer, \u201cFriendship and\nSolidarity\u201d; see Vessey 2005). Moreover, Paul Ricoeur has argued\nthat an important test of the universality of hermeneutics is the\nextension of hermeneutical considerations to the practical sphere. In\nthis, he clarifies that and how interpretive experience, especially\nthe interpretive experience of narrative, plays an important role no\nless in practical agency than political critique (see Ricoeur,\nFrom Text to Action).\n\nIt is therefore perhaps no surprise that several philosophers have\ndeveloped approaches and positions in ethical and political philosophy\nin connection with hermeneutics. In ethical philosophy, for example,\nDennis Schmidt has recently argued that Gadamer\u2019s philosophical\nhermeneutics comprises an \u2018original ethics,\u2019 in that\nGadamer clarifies normative implications of interpretive experience\nthat, however, are irreducible to any ethical system or principles\n(see D. Schmidt 2008, 2012 and 2016). In political philosophy, Richard\nBernstein\u2019s considerations of human rationality \u2018beyond\nobjectivism and relativism,\u2019 and the attention he gives to\nhermeneutics in this context, has been an important impetus (Bernstein\n1983). Relatedly, Genevieve Lloyd has invoked hermeneutic motifs to\nquestion norms of rationality from a feminist perspective (Lloyd\n1984). Fred Dallmayr\u2019s use of Gadamer\u2019s hermeneutics in\nhis considerations of political theory, comparative political theory,\nand inter-cultural dialogue (see for example Dallmayr 1987, 1996 and\n2009) have been likewise influential. Georgia Warnke has defended\nGadamer\u2019s hermeneutics as a middle path between subjectivism and\nconservatism, and, in turn, she has examined the significance of\nhermeneutics for democratic theory, theories of deliberative\ndemocracy, questions of race and identity, and solidarity (see for\nexample Warnke 1987, 1993, 2002, 2007 and 2012). Linda Mart\u03afn\nAlcoff has also drawn substantially on Gadamer\u2019s hermeneutics in\nconsiderations of race and gender identity (see Alcoff 2006). Lauren\nSwayne Barthold has drawn on hermeneutics to develop a feminist\napproach to social identity and, more recently, to examine the\nsignificance of civic dialogue to foster pluralistic, democratic\ncommunities (see Barthold 2016 and 2020).\n8.3 The Return of Normativity to Hermeneutics\n\nRecent research in hermeneutics has seen a rise of interest in the\nrole played in interpretive experience by a number of normative\nmatters. In this, some argue that the influence of Heidegger and\nGadamer over contemporary hermeneutics has led to a neglect of\nnormative considerations in current debate. To be sure, it is possible\nto defend Heidegger and Gadamer against the charge that their\napproaches leave too little room for normative considerations. When it\ncomes to Heidegger, Steven Crowell, for example, argues that\nphenomenology as conceived by Husserl and Heidegger can itself be\ngrasped as inquiry into a \u201cnormatively structured \u2018space\nof meaning\u2019\u201d (Crowell 2016, 238). Crowell, in his\nconsideration of Heidegger, focuses on Heidegger\u2019s analysis of\nhuman existence, arguing that Heidegger\u2019s view of the role\nplayed by care in human existence speaks to the possibility of being\nresponsive to norms as such (Crowell 2013). When it comes to Gadamer,\nattempts to defend his philosophical hermeneutics against charges that\nit neglects normative concerns have played an important role in debate\nsince Habermas first raised objections against Gadamer.\n\nRecent interest in the role played in interpretive experience by\nnormative considerations, though, has also led to a revival of\ninterest in these matters in hermeneutics before Heidegger. Kristin\nGjesdal, in her recent Gadamer and the Legacy of German\nIdealism, for example, recommends that we return to\nSchleiermacher in order to focus attention on\n\u201ccritical-normative standards in interpretation\u201d (Gjesdal\n2009, 7). Rudolf Makkreel, in his recent Orientation and Judgment\nin Hermeneutics, argues for the priority of judgment, and with\nit, reflection and criticism, in interpretive experience. Really,\nMakkreel\u2019s project is to develop an original position or\napproach within hermeneutics in its own right, one that takes up\nhermeneutical considerations in our contemporary, multi-cultural\ncontext, and that relies on a broad range of philosophers associated\nwith hermeneutics. But, he develops his view of judgment, and the\nnormative considerations involved in it, in reference to Kant and\nDilthey in particular.\n8.4 Hermeneutics and New Realism\n\nRecent developments in hermeneutics have arisen in response to\n\u2018new realism.\u2019 This school of thought is represented\nespecially by philosophers Maurizio Ferraris and Markus Gabriel, and\ninvites comparisons with the \u2018speculative realism\u2019 of\nphilosophers such as Quentin Meillassoux and Graham Harman (see\nFerraris 2012, Gabriel 2015, Gabriel 2020, Meillassoux 2008; Harman\n2018). The new orientation toward realism is characterized, first of\nall, by a rejection of a common thesis of postmodern and radical\nconstructivism: the position that our interpretations are constitutive\nof what we otherwise call reality. To this extent, the new interest in\nrealism is compatible with other forms of realism. Yet, new realism\nopposes not only radical constructivism but also a basic tenet of\nmetaphysical realism: the idea that reality is comprised exclusively\nof mind-independent things. One of the most influential approaches of\nsuch new-realist opposition against metaphysical realism is found in\nGabriel. He makes a distinction between metaphysics and ontology, and\nargues in his new realist ontology that what we usually associate with\nmind, namely, our descriptions or interpretations of things, are no\nless real than what they relate to. Such descriptions or\ninterpretations are rather distinguished by their function, which is\nto individuate (Gabriel 2015, 9\u201311).\n\nThe rise of this orientation toward realism has garnered significant\nattention in its own right. Especially important for contemporary\nhermeneutics, however, is that this new orientation toward realism has\nbeen an impetus for new developments. At one extreme, the rise of\nrealism has recently led Gianni Vattimo not only to defend his\npostmodern hermeneutics against realism, but, moreover to develop a\npolemical critique of the motivations, philosophical and otherwise, to\npursue realism. In this, Vattimo maintains that the rise of realism is\nmotivated, in part, by a conservative reactionism against the\nconsequences of postmodernism. He writes, for example, that among\nother roots of realism is \u201cthe fundamental neurosis that follows\nthe late-industrial society as the regressive reaction of defense\nagainst the postmodern Babel of languages and values\u201d (Vattimo\n2016, 77).\n\nOther developments within hermeneutics have been much more favorable\ntoward the renewed interest in realism. Some philosophers, such as\nG\u00fcnter Figal and Anton Koch, have discerned important affinities\nbetween hermeneutics and new realism, and, in turn, have developed\npositions that they have identified as \u2018hermeneutical\nrealism.\u2019 Hermeneutical realism opposes the postmodern view that\ninterpretations constitute reality, maintaining, by contrast, that\ninterpretive experience belongs to reality. Figal, in his\nhermeneutical realism, develops his realistic approach principally in\nterms of the phenomenological problem of appearance. In this, he\nfocuses on space, grasped as what first places us in referential\nrelations to objects, and, with this, makes available interpretive\npossibilities to determine the sense of them (Figal, 2009, 2010 and\n2015). Koch, for his part, develops his hermeneutical realism on the\nbasis of motifs found in German Idealism, arguing for the necessity of\nthe subject, grasped in its spatio-temporal, corporeal, and living\nsubjectivity, as what makes things interpretable (as he has it,\nreadable and translatable) (Koch 2016 and 2019). Thus, on his view,\nwhile real things are independent of individual interpretations, such\nthings are not independent of being interpretable in general.\n\nFinally, hermeneutical realism has also led to novel research on\nclassical figures in hermeneutics. Whereas Vattimo, for example, sees\nin Gadamer the seeds of his postmodern hermeneutics (see Vattimo,\n\u201cStory of a Comma\u201d), Figal, by contrast, brings into focus\nthe realism of Gadamer\u2019s concern for the substantiveness\n(Sachlichkeit) of interpretive experience (see Figal 2010, 2).\nMoreover, some philosophers have found that hermeneutical realism\nsheds light on central motifs of the later Heidegger (Keiling\n2018).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Alcoff, Linda Mart\u00edn, 2006, <em>Visible Identities: Race\nGender, and the Self</em>, New York: Oxford University Press.", "Bambach, Charles R., 1995, <em>Heidegger, Dilthey, and the Crisis\nof Historicism</em>, Ithica, NY: Cornell University Press.", "Barthold, Lauren Swayne, 2016, <em>A Hermeneutic Approach to\nGender and Other Social Identities</em>, New York: Palgrave\nMacmillan.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2020, <em>Overcoming Polarization in the\nPublic Square: Civic Dialogue</em>, New York: Palgrave MacMillan.", "Behler, Ernst, 1993, <em>German Romantic Literary Theory</em>,\nCambridge: Cambridge University Press.", "Beiser, Frederick C., 2011, <em>The German Historicist\nTradition</em>, Oxford: Oxford University Press.", "Benso, Silvia, 2018, \u201cLuigi Pareyson: A Master in Italian\nHermeneutics,\u201d in Benso, Silvia and Brian Schroeder (eds.),\n<em>Thinking the Inexhaustible: Art, Interpretation, and Freedom in\nthe Philosophy of Luigi Pareyson</em>, Albany: State University of New\nYork Press.", "Brandom, Robert, 2002, <em>Tales of the Mighty Dead: Historical\nEssays in the Metaphysics of Intentionality</em>, Cambridge, MA:\nHarvard University Press.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2004, \u201cHermeneutic Practice and\nTheories of Meaning,\u201d <em>SATS: Nordic Journal of\nPhilosophy</em>, 5 (1): 5\u201326.", "Caputo, John D., 1987, <em>Radical Hermeneutics: Repetition,\nDeconstruction, and the Hermeneutic Project</em>, Bloomington: Indiana\nUniversity Press.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2018, <em>Hermeneutics: Facts and\nInterpretation in the Age of Information</em>, London: Pelican\nBooks.", "Crowell, Steven, 2013, <em>Normativity and Phenomenology in\nHusserl and Heidegger</em>, Cambridge: Cambridge University\nPress.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2016, \u201cPhenomenology, Meaning, and\nMeasure: Response to Maxime Doyon and Thomas Sheehan,\u201d\n<em>Philosophy Today</em>, 60 (1): 237\u2013252.", "Dallmayr, Fred, 1987, <em>Critical Encounters: Between Philosophy\nand Politics</em>, Notre Dame, IN: Notre Dame University Press.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1996, <em>Beyond Orientalism: Essays on\nCross-Cultural Encounter</em>, Albany, NY: State University of New\nYork Press.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2009, \u201cHermeneutics and\ninter-cultural dialog: linking theory and practice,\u201d <em>Ethics\nand Global Practice</em> 2 (1): 23\u201329.", "Davey, Nicholas, 2006, <em>Unquiet Understanding: Gadamer\u2019s\nPhilosophical Hermeneutics</em>, Albany: State University of New York\nPress.", "Derrida, Jacques, 1967 [1978], \u201cLa structure, le signe et le\njeu dans le discours des sciences humaines,\u201d\nin <em>L\u2019\u00c9criture et la diff\u00e9rance</em>,\npp. 409\u201328, Paris: \u00c9ditions du Seuil.
