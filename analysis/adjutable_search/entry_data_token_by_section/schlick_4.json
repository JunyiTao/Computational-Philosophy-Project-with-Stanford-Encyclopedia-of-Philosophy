General Theory of Knowledge\n\n\nSchlick\u2019s earlier epistemological insights, as well as the\nconventionalist framework developed in his work on the Special Theory,\nset the stage for his thought in the two works which distinguish his\npre-Positivist era: General Theory of Knowledge (largely\ncomposed in 1916, with its first edition appearing in 1918 and the\nsecond edition in 1925) and Space and Time in Contemporary\nPhysics. (Engler 2009, 130 fn. 51)  (Space\nand Time \u2026 appeared for the first time in 1917 as an\nextended essay in the prestigious journal, Die\nNaturwissenschaften; soon it was re-issued in three more editions\nand eventually translated into eleven languages). Before\nexplaining how Schlick\u2019s epistemology embraced the new physics,\nit is necessary, first of all, to consider how he further developed his\nearlier epistemological insights.\n\nGeneral Theory is notable for a key innovation in its\ntreatment of concepts, for they are defined in terms of mathematical\nequations rather than reducing them to complexes of intuitive images\n(Schlick 2009, Sec. 5). In order to articulate his ideas about the\nnature of concepts and how they are formed, Schlick borrowed the idea\nof definition by axioms from recent work in the foundations of geometry\nby Moritz Pasch, David Hilbert, and Henri Poincar\u00e9. In their\nwork on alternative geometries, these mathematicians came to regard the\neffects of altering the axioms of geometry as changing the meaning of\ntheir constituent terms, thus re-defining the primitive geometric\nconcepts. The idea is ingenious in its simplicity, for it treats\nthe geometric primitives as defined by the relations they bear to one\nanother according to the axioms, so the meanings of the terms\n\u2018point\u2019, \u2018lies between\u2019, and \u2018lies\nupon\u2019 are fixed by the geometric axioms. The reason\nmathematicians adopted this method is to insure the certainty of\ngeometry by insuring that it was invulnerable to the criticism that its\nprimitive elements were defined by intuition.\n\n\nSchlick claimed the method of definition by axioms was implicit\nbecause, unlike explicit definition, occurrences of the defined term\ncannot necessarily be replaced by a combination of the expressions which define\nit. And he praised the method for its specification of\nmeanings independently of any intuitive content. Implicitly\ndefined terms possess a clarity and precision of scope which cannot be\nachieved by concepts defined by abstraction from\nexperience. Since, of course, axiomatic definitions\nstipulate the meanings of all their constituent concepts in terms of\nthe remaining ones, the axioms effectively define concepts by their\nrelations to one another. Thus implicit definitions are\nstructural definitions, and their constituent terms are structurally\ndefined (Schlick 2009, Sec. 7). The concepts thus defined are\nonly related to the other elements of the axiom system and are not\nrelated to anything external to the axiom system until the definition\nis coordinated with extra-linguistic things. In Schlick\u2019s\nearlier writings, he had stated that concepts themselves are functions\nwhich signify or designate the items with which they are coordinated or\nassociated. Accordingly, even implicitly defined concepts must be\ncoordinated with objects, elements of the class of things to which it\napplies (Schlick 1979a, 130; Schlick 2009, 23; Ryckman 1991,\nSec. 3). Of course, these objects, like the concepts which\ndesignate them, are distinguished by possession of the properties in\nterms of which the designating concepts are defined. Such\ncoordinations give empirical content to implicitly defined concepts,\ntransforming them into full-blooded concepts rather than empty\nplace-holders. Moreover, the concepts which dominate\nscientific thought at any given stage of its development must be\nmodified, revised, and supplemented as science advances. Then a\nconceptual characterization of a given phenomena which was used at an\nearlier stage may not be at a later stage as, for instance, the\njudgment \u2018A light-ray consists of a stream of moving\nparticles\u2019, drawn from Newtonian optics was later replaced by\n\u2018A light-ray consists of electromagnetic waves\u2019. \n\n\nSchlick\u2019s new understanding of concept-formation allows him to\nseriously address the question of how the respective intuitive spaces\nof each of the senses are coordinated in the construction of a general\nintuitive space, which is not specific to any particular sense\nmodality. The intuitive images of experience are spatially\nordered, since they exhibit relative locations as well as spatial\nextension. In addition, since experiences occur one after\nanother, they also exhibit an intuitive temporal order. This\nresults in a distinct spatio-temporal ordering for each of the sense\nmodalities, so that an intuitive order of smells, as well as an\nintuitive order of tastes (and so forth) are given in\nexperience. The first step in the advance from purely\nsubjective experiences to the transcendent reality of scientific\nobjects is to coordinate the spatio-temporal frameworks of the distinct\nsense modalities. Thus, when a sore spot on one\u2019s leg is\ntouched by one\u2019s forefinger, the feeling of the touch is\naccompanied by a visual image of the finger touching the leg. The\ncoincidence of these two separate and distinct types of sensory data\ncontributes evidence to the overall coordination of the spatio-temporal\norders of the different sense modalities. This is the\nmethod of point-coincidences which Schlick applied to characterize the\nadvance to knowledge of the transcendent world from the purely\nsubjective domain of qualitative images. Of course, the idea of\npoint-coincidences also plays a central role in General Relativity and\nit has generally been assumed that Schlick picked up the idea from his\nwork on the new physics. But recent scholarship has demonstrated\nthat, in fact, Schlick worked on the notion long before Einstein\npublished the General Theory and may well have been Einstein\u2019s\nsource of the notion (Engler 2009, 135ff). The important\npoint in the present context is that the coordination of a single\nindividual\u2019s sense modalities is but the first step in the\nconstruction of the transcendent order. The next phase consists\nof the coordination of point-coincidences among different\nindividuals. If an instructor wishes to draw attention to some\nfeature of a triangle on a blackboard at the front of a class, he\npoints to the feature, thus effecting a point-coincidence between the\ntip of his finger and the feature of the triangle. And even\nthough everyone witnessing the demonstration has a different\nperspective, what they all share is their observation of the\npoint-coincidence of finger-tip and the geometric feature. \nFurther, it is to be noted that not every sensory point-coincidence is\nan objective one and it is generally true that not every objective\npoint-coincidence is observed directly but is constructed or inferred\nfrom ones that are. Finally, all measurements, all determinations\nof space and time, are based on just such spatio-temporal\npoint-coincidences (Schlick 2009, Sec. 31).\n\n\nEarlier Schlick had argued that knowledge consists in the\nidentification of that which is known with that as which it is known\nor, in other words, knowledge consists in the relation of one\nthing to some other thing, as which it is known. And this is only\nachieved when one of the objects which is known is, in turn, related to\nstill others, as it is in the myriad spatio-temporal relations in which\nit stands to other objects. Ultimately, all these relations can\nbe known quantitatively by specifying a number of magnitudes, thus\nreducing the relations of the objective spatio-temporal order to\nquantities. Of course, this cannot be achieved within the\nqualitative order since the different relations of position and\ntemporal order are qualitatively different and cannot, for that very\nreason, be compared. But the entities populating the objective\nspatio-temporal order are wholly unlike the denizens of the subjective\nrealm which are the intuitive objects of experience, the immediately\ngiven sensory data. Both may be univocally designated by\nimplicitly defined concepts and both kinds of entities are, therefore,\nobjects of possible knowledge. As such, intuitive contents are\nattributed full reality and, in addition, the objects populating the\nspatio-temporal order, the entities of advanced theoretical science,\nare just as real as the contents of consciousness with which they are\ncorrelated.\n\n\nSchlick expended considerable effort discussing the differences between\nintuitive acquaintance and conceptual knowledge, insisting that, even\nthough intuitive images are real, acquaintance with them does not\nconstitute knowledge. This thesis directly confronts the idea,\nheld by a number of philosophers, that acquaintance with intuitive\ncontents is, indeed, a species of knowledge which is more direct and\nimmediate than conceptual knowledge. By comparison, scientific\nknowledge is regarded as a poor substitute, lacking the intimacy of\nintuitive acquaintance. Two champions of this belief are\n Henri Bergson,\nwho\nthought that direct access to intuitive contents could (somehow)\n\u2018unite\u2019 the knower with the object known, and\n Edmund Husserl,\nwho\nproposed that a genuinely philosophical intuition could become the\nbasis of a kind of scientific cognition in which the subject is in\ndirect contact with its object, without any symbolism or mathematics,\nany inferences or proofs (Bergson 1955; Husserl 1965). \nBergson called this intimate perception of objects\n\u2018intuition\u2019 and Husserl called it\n\u2018wesenschau\u2019. But the reason why intuition\ncan never constitute knowledge is, of course, quite obvious to\nSchlick. On his view, knowledge requires two terms: that which is\nknown and that, as which, it is known. But intuition, considered\nas an act of consciousness, involves only that which is intuited. \nIn short, the attempt to identify intuition as a form of knowledge is\nsimply a conflation of knowledge with acquaintance, of unelaborated,\ndirect perception or sensation with conceptual knowledge, of\nkennen with erkennen (Schlick 2009, Sec. 12).\n\n\nSchlick\u2019s discussion of the differences between intuition and\nknowledge laid the groundwork for his treatment of realism. He\ncautioned, at the outset of his discussion, that the question of\nrealism is not a philosophical problem, but an everyday one. And\nthe view that guides the comings and goings of ordinary life is\nna\u00efve realism, which assumes that reality consists simply of the\nobjects of sense perception. Of course, the demands of day-to-day\naffairs seldom require any distinction between the perception of an\nobject and the object perceived, until one encounters an illusion which\ndemands the differentiation of, say, a mirage from a puddle or\npond. Only then is a representation first distinguished from its\nobject. It is at this point that the ordinary person realizes\nthat the mirage was real but that the pond or puddle was not. \nThus refined, the na\u00efve criterion of reality is extended beyond\nthe reach of the senses once it is realized that, even when an object\nis not perceived, its effects provide a sufficient condition of its\nreality, as when a hunter finds a ravaged animal in the forest and\nconcludes that a predator is in the neighborhood. And it is in\nprecisely this way that na\u00efve realism is naturally extended to\ninclude, not just perceptions themselves as well as the objects\nperceived, but also the causal sources of observed effects. In\nthis way, na\u00efve realism naturally leads to classical causal\nrealism.\n\n\nThen it simply becomes useful to refer to those objects which are not\ngiven in sensory experience \u2013 or at least not presently given\n\u2013 as \u2018things-in-themselves\u2019 since they are, by the\ncausal criterion, real. Things-in-themselves are just the transcendent\nentities of the objective, three-dimensional world of everyday\nmaterial objects, as well as the unobservable, theoretical entities\npostulated by contemporary science. Unsurprisingly, the reality of\nthese entities is contested by a variety of related views, which\nSchlick classifies as \u2018immanence\u2019 philosophies. The most\nprominent immanence view is the kind of phenomenalism found in\nthinkers from John Stuart Mill to contemporaries like Joseph Petzoldt,\nErnst Mach, and (as Schlick added in the second edition of General\nTheory \u2026), Bertrand Russell. More curious, perhaps, is\nthat Schlick also indicted his intellectual forebear, Hermann von\nHelmholtz, as an immanence philosopher. Basically, these thinkers all\nrestrict reality to the given, so that reality consists exclusively of\ncolors, tastes, and smells, as well as other sensations, presented in\nconstantly changing combinations with one another. This is, of course,\njust to deny the reality of transcendent objects, thus abjuring the\ncausal realism implicit in everyday and scientific talk of\ntranscendent objects which exist and endure beyond momentary\nsensations. Instead, the immanence thinkers claim that all talk of\ntranscendent objects consists entirely of discourse about complexes of\nsensations which exhibit more stability and constancy than\nothers. Mach stated the common view of immanence philosophies that\nmaterial bodies do not produce sensations, because bodies are, at\nbottom, nothing more than complexes of sensations (Schlick 2009, Sec.\n25). Of course, immanence views differ among themselves in their\nefforts to identify which particular complexes of sensation are\nidentified with everyday material bodies and scientific entities,\nespecially when the latter are not perceived. \n\n\nThe classic immanence view is one which identifies material bodies\nwith the combinations of sensations which would appear, in a given\nsituation, if a perceiver were present. Of course, this is just\nJohn Stuart Mill\u2019s definition of bodies as \u2018permanent\npossibilities of sensation\u2019 \u2013 a treatment which persists in\nthe writings of many of his followers, in one form or another. \nFor instance, Bertrand Russell, in Our Knowledge of the External\nWorld, calls the stable combinations \u2018aspects\u2019,\ndeclaring that \u201cThings are those series of aspects which obey the\nlaws of physics\u201d (Russell 1922, 110). Specifically, Russell\nargued that so-called \u2018ideal aspects\u2019 \u2013 ones which are\nnot presently perceived \u2013 may be logically constructed from those which\nare. Their reality may then be readily assumed. But with\nthis assumption, any grounds of distinguishing between given aspects\nand assumed ones vanishes, nor is there any means of recovering them,\nwithout complicating the system beyond all recognition. Schlick\nnoted that, because of Russell\u2019s sheer audacity in pushing his\naccount to the limit, the result is not prone to the inconsistencies\nwhich plague other accounts. Indeed, it is undeniable that\nRussell\u2019s \u201cbold position\u201d is one of the most\nsuccessful efforts to carry out the immanence philosophy (Schlick\n2009, 502). In a different vein, Joseph Petzoldt acknowledged that\nesse is not the same as percipi, though he then\nendeavored to identify the existence of objects with some limited group\nof sensations, a different group for each perceiver. Despite the\ncountless problems this approach encountered, the critical point which\nPetzoldt missed is simply that it is impossible to simply identify any\nparticular sensation or group of sensations with a material body,\nwithout further conditions relating the sensation or sensations (as,\nfor instance, Russell provided) (Russell 1922, 106). And\nthat is because it is the lawful regularity among sensations which\nwarrants the collection of the series of changing sensations under a\nsingle material body. Mach very nearly realized this when, in\nThe Analysis of Sensation, he abandoned Mill\u2019s\n\u2018possibilities\u2019 and replaced them with the mathematical\nnotion of a functional relation. But such a purely\nmathematical idea can never be substituted for an empirically-based\nconcept of reality. Such efforts are, at bottom, attempts to\nconceptually embody a law, as epitomized in Helmholtz\u2019 \u201cThe\nConservation of Force: A Memoir\u201d (Kahl 1977, pp. 49\u201350). \nSpecifically, Helmholtz identified the objective power of a law with\nforce, thus reducing the reality of material bodies and scientific\nentities to a conceptual substitute. But concepts, according to\nSchlick, can never possess the reality of the contents of consciousness\nor transcendent things-in-themselves (Schlick 2009, Sec. 25). \n",
