    "main_text": "The Euthyphro Problem\n2. The Euthyphro Problem\n\nAccording to many, Socrates\u2019s position fits well with\nmorality\u2019s pretensions. It fits well also with the thought that\nwhatever standards humans might put in place are, one and all, liable\nto moral criticism. Of course, Socrates\u2019s position brings along\na suite of puzzles concerning the nature of these transcendent\nstandards. What is their origin and from where do they derive their\nauthority?\n\nMany have thought the right answers to these questions are found in an\nappeal to God. On their view, moral principles are the expression of\nGod\u2019s will\u2014they are His commands to us\u2014and they get\ntheir authority from their source. In important ways, though, this\nmerely shifts the puzzles back a step. Whatever problems one might\nhave making sense of eternal transcendent standards re-emerge when\ntrying to make sense of an eternal transcendent being who might issue\ncommands. And, as Plato emphasized in Euthyphro, one is also\nleft with the difficulty of explaining why God\u2019s commands are\nauthoritative.\n\nOne plausible answer might be that God\u2019s perfect knowledge of\nright and wrong, or God\u2019s own moral perfection, explains why his\ncommands serve legitimately as standards for us. But that answer\nassumes that standards of morality exist independently of God\u2019s\nwill (either as objects of his knowledge or as standards in light of\nwhich He counts as morally perfect), in which case speaking of\nmorality as consisting of God\u2019s commands will not explain the\norigin or nature of these independently existing standards.\n\nAlternatively, one might eschew an appeal to God\u2019s knowledge or\ngoodness and claim that there is no independent standard for\nGod\u2019s will and nature. But that leaves in place the puzzle\nconcerning the authority of moral principles. If we reject the idea\nthat God\u2019s commands reflect His knowledge of right and wrong,\nand reject the idea that there is an independent standard for\nGod\u2019s will and nature (in light of which we recognize Him as all\ngood), it seems reasonable to wonder why his commands have any special\n authority.[3]\n\nOne might here point to God\u2019s power to punish or to His role in\nour creation. But neither consideration seems to establish legitimate\nauthority on its own. In general, at least, the mere fact that one has\nthe power to enforce one\u2019s commands does not establish those\ncommands as legitimate, nor does it ensure that one has a right to\npunish those who fail to conform to one\u2019s commands. Similarly,\nin general, the mere fact that one created something does not\nestablish that one properly has absolute control over what one has\ncreated. Of course, room remains to argue that there is something\nspecial about God\u2019s power, or about His role as creator, that\nmakes his commands distinctively legitimate. What is needed is an\naccount of what is special. And, in this context, it needs to be an\naccount that explains how God\u2019s commands, as opposed to the\ncommands that others might issue, have an authority. Moreover, if\nappealing to God is to solve the metaethical puzzle posed by\nEuthyphro, the account offered must not itself rely on, or presuppose,\nthe sort of transcendent standards we have been attempting to\nexplain.\n",
