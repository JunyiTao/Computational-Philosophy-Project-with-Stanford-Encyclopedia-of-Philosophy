    "main_text": "Method and Nature of Philosophical Inquiry\n2. Method and Nature of Philosophical Inquiry\n\n\nCommentators and historians conventionally designate Gassendi as an\nearly modern thinker yet there is good reason to at least consider his\nwork as belonging to the tail end of the preceding period. One facet\nof his work that closely resembles Renaissance philosophy and science\nis the historical focus of his method of inquiry. For almost every\nphilosophical issue Gassendi deems worthy of discussion, he first\nintroduces a wide range of previous competing views, beginning with\nthe antique schools, which he considers as \u2018live\u2019\noptions. He engages with Aristotle and early (as well as late)\nAristotelianism, and allows great debts to Skeptic, Stoic, and\nEpicurean thought. The history of philosophy is for him a source of\nvitally important reasoning, the generally correct way to frame our\nquestions, and more occasionally, the answers to those questions. Thus\none principal attraction of atomism for Gassendi is that it suggests a\nway to think about causation among material objects which he finds an\nattractive alternative to Aristotelian views on one hand and\nnon-physicalist views on the other. In his theory of knowledge we find\none more instance of using ancient frameworks to model contemporary\nproblems: no criterion of truth, for example, is adequate unless it\nsatisfies the standard points made by the classical Skeptics. Some may\nsee this as evidence of Gassendi's modernism, but his broad concerns\nwith Skeptical thought certainly place him among good Renaissance\ncompany. (The Skepticist and anti-Aristotelian strains of his\nExercitationes are also thought to be influenced by his reading of\nnear-contemporaries, including Juan Luis Vives and Pierre\nCharron.)\n\n\nAnother Renaissance-type element of Gassendi's writings is his\nstylistic obsession with antiquity. His Latin is learned if a bit\nstultified, rife with quotations from Virgil, Horace, Cicero,\nTertullian, and others. An embroidered, ornate quality marks his few\nextant French writings, too. He quotes frequently and liberally from\nclassical sources, usually in Latin though sometimes in Greek, and his\ntranslation of Diogenes Laertius's Book X on the life of Epicurus is\nthe centerpiece of his 1649 Animadversiones. Gassendi does\nnot, as does Descartes, suggest his work is so modern as to have been\ninvented de novo. Rather, he constantly refers the reader to\na wide variety of other, generally classical writers as sources of\nboth like-minded and conflicting perspectives. Finally, the single\nmost time-consuming project of his career consists in his prodigious\nefforts towards reviving the works and reputation of one particular\nclassical figure, Epicurus.\n\n\nThese Renaissance trappings notwithstanding, there are also at least\ntwo reasons to think of Gassendi as very much among the moderns. For\none, he embraces the new empiricist's assessment of the old science:\nwhat is wrong with the Aristotelians' physics is its routine\npresentation, as well as grounding, in apriori theoretical\nclaims. He is not the only, or the first author of such a\nview. Galileo breaks with tradition in distinguishing a science of\nmotion that, in principle at least, makes use of observation and\nexperiment. Bacon and Descartes, for their part, also counsel (to\nvarying degrees) a scientific method which builds on experiential\nknowledge. But among the savants of the early seventeenth\ncentury, only Gassendi, whose awareness of empiricism's roots and\nimplications is evident across his intellectual pursuits, integrates\nphilosophy and science on what he believes to be strictly empiricist\ngrounds. This integration is a natural consequence of his suggestion\nthat we gain all knowledge\u2014outside of the theological\u2014from\nthe senses.\n\n\nA range of equally modern views follow from his proposed empiricist\nfoundations for the new science and its methods. He suggests a\nprobabilist notion of what counts as warranted empirical belief, and\ninsists that we may license beliefs about the sub- and\nsupra-perceivable but only if they are well-grounded in our beliefs\nabout the perceptually given. Further, he devises rules for accepting\nor rejecting hypotheses, and guidelines for directing empirical\ndiscoveries and our judgments of the same, where all such claims are\nsubject to the test of evidence from experiment or observation. It is\nfar from true that all, or even most, of his own claims about the\nnature of the physical world meet this test, but the modernity of\nGassendi's philosophy and science lies in his proposal that this is a\ngoal to be set, altogether.\n",
