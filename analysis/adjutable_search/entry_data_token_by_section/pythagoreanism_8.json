    "main_text": "Other Pythagoreans of the Sixth, Fifth and Fourth Centuries || Pythagorean Women\n3.3 Pythagorean Women\n\nWomen were probably more active in Pythagoreanism than any other\nancient philosophical movement. The evidence is not extensive but is\nsufficient to give us a glimpse of their role. At the end of the\ncatalogue of Pythagoreans in Iamblichus\u2019 On the Pythagorean\nLife, after the list of 218 male Pythagoreans, the names of 17\nPythagorean women are given (VP 267). Since this list is\nlikely to be based on the work of Aristoxenus, it probably represents\nwhat Aristoxenus learned from fourth-century Pythagoreans, although we\ncannot, of course, be certain that some names were not inserted into\nthe list after the time of Aristoxenus (see section 3.1 above). Eleven\nare identified as the wife, daughter or sister of a man but seven are\nsimply identified by their region or city-state of origin, although\nthe Echecrateia of Phlius listed seems likely to be connected to the\nEchecrates of Phlius who appears in Plato\u2019s Phaedo. We\nknow nothing else about most of the names on the list and thus cannot\nbe sure in individual cases whether they belong to the sixth, fifth or\nfourth century. For a speculative reconstruction of the role of women\nin the Pythagorean society see Rowett (2014, 122\u2013123), but this\nreconstruction partly depends on the speech that Iamblichus reports\nPythagoras gave to the women of Croton upon his arrival (VP\n54\u201357); however, while Pythagoras did give speeches to different\ngroups, including women, the text of the speech in Iamblichus is\nprobably a later fabrication (Burkert 1972a, 115; Zhmud 2012a, 70).\nThe Pythagoreans put particular emphasis on marital fidelity on the\npart of both men and women (Gemelli Marciano 2014, 145). There is also\nno reliable evidence for any writings by these women, although in the\nlater tradition works were forged in the names of some of them and of\nother Pythagorean women not on the list (see section 4.2 below). \n\nThe most famous name on the list is Theano who is here called the wife\nof Brontinus but who is elsewhere treated as either the wife, daughter\nor pupil of Pythagoras (Diogenes Laertius VIII 42; Burkert 1972a,\n114). The role of women in early Pythagoreanism and the centrality of\nTheano is further attested by Aristoxenus\u2019 contemporary,\nDicaearchus, who reports that Pythagoras had as followers not just men\nbut also women and that one of these, Theano, became famous (Fr. 40\nMirhday = Porphyry, VP 19). It is striking that Dicaearchus\ndoes not identify her as the wife of either Brontius or Pythagoras but\nsimply as a follower of Pythagoras. In the later tradition a number of\nworks were forged in her name (see section 4.2 below), but we have\nlittle reliable evidence about her (see Thesleff 1965, 193\u2013201,\nfor testimonia and texts; Delatte 1922, 246\u2013249; and Montepaone\n1993). The second most famous name on the list is Timycha who, when\nten months pregnant, reportedly bit off her own tongue so that she\ncould not, under torture, reveal Pythagorean secrets to the tyrant\nDionysius (Iamblichus, VP 189\u2013194). This story goes\nback to Neanthes, writing in the late fourth or early third century\nand may rely on local Pythagorean tradition (Schorn 2014, 310).\n",
