    "main_text": "History of social choice theory || Condorcet\n1.1 Condorcet\n\nThe two scholars most often associated with the development of social\nchoice theory are the Frenchman Nicolas de Condorcet (1743\u20131794)\nand the American Kenneth Arrow (1921\u20132017). Condorcet was a\nliberal thinker in the era of the French Revolution who was pursued by\nthe revolutionary authorities for criticizing them. After a period of\nhiding, he was eventually arrested, though apparently not immediately\nidentified, and he died in prison (see McLean and Hewitt 1994). In his\nEssay on the Application of Analysis to the Probability of\nMajority Decisions (1785), he advocated a particular voting\nsystem, pairwise majority voting, and presented his two most prominent\ninsights. The first, known as Condorcet\u2019s jury theorem,\nis that if each member of a jury has an equal and independent chance\nbetter than random, but worse than perfect, of making a correct\njudgment on whether a defendant is guilty (or on some other factual\nproposition), the majority of jurors is more likely to be correct than\neach individual juror, and the probability of a correct majority\njudgment approaches 1 as the jury size increases. Thus, under certain\nidealized conditions, majority rule is good at \u2018tracking the\ntruth\u2019 (e.g., Grofman, Owen, and Feld 1983).\n\nCondorcet\u2019s second insight, often called Condorcet\u2019s\nparadox, is the observation that majority preferences can be\n\u2018irrational\u2019 (specifically, intransitive) even when\nindividual preferences are \u2018rational\u2019 (specifically,\ntransitive). Suppose, for example, that one third of a group prefers\nalternative \\(x\\) to \\(y\\) to \\(z\\), a second third prefers \\(y\\) to\n\\(z\\) to \\(x\\), and a final third prefers \\(z\\) to \\(x\\) to \\(y\\).\nThen there are majorities (of two thirds) for \\(x\\) against \\(y\\), for\n\\(y\\) against \\(z\\), and for \\(z\\) against \\(x\\): a\n\u2018cycle\u2019, which violates transitivity. Furthermore, no\nalternative is a Condorcet winner, an alternative that beats,\nor at least ties with, every other alternative in pairwise majority\ncontests.\n\nCondorcet anticipated a key theme of modern social choice theory:\nmajority rule is at once a plausible method of collective decision\nmaking and yet subject to some surprising problems. Resolving or\nbypassing these problems remains one of social choice theory\u2019s\ncore concerns.\n",
