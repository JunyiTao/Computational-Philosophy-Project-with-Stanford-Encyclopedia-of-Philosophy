    "main_text": "Dilthey\u2019s Main Philosophical Works || The 1890s: Understanding as Structural Articulation\n2.2 The 1890s: Understanding as Structural Articulation\n\nThis new, more descriptive structural approach is inaugurated in the\nessay \u201cThe Origin of Our Belief in the Reality of the External\nWorld and Its Justification\u201d of 1890. Here Dilthey writes that\nthe structure of all psychic life consists of impressions\n\u201cevoking purposive reactions in the system of our drives and the\nfeelings connected with them\u201d (1890a/SW.II, 14). Rather than\nbasing our initial sense of an external world on theoretical\ninferences from effects to causes, he roots it in a felt resistance to\nthe will. But resistance must be internalized as a restraint of a\nvolitional intention for it to signify the existence of something\nindependent. Thus Dilthey is not merely replacing a representational\nphenomenalism with a direct perceptual realism. Each perceptual\nprocess has \u201can inner side\u201d that involves \u201can energy\nand affective tone deriving from inner strivings that connect it to\nour own life\u201d (1890a/SW.II, 14). All aspects of our own life are\nbrought into play as we respond to the world.\n\nIn 1894 Dilthey published his \u201cIdeas for a Descriptive and\nAnalytic Psychology\u201d and established how it differs from\ntraditional explanative psychologies. He admits that even a\ndescriptive psychology will seek to explicate the causal relationships\nof life, but that it must differ from explanative psychology by not\ntrying to \u201cderive a comprehensive and transparent cognition of\npsychological phenomena from a limited number of univocally determined\nelements\u201d (1894/SW.II, 116). Unlike the associationists, Dilthey\nwill not posit simple, stable impressions that are then combined into\nmore complex ideas. They introduce unnecessary hypothetical elements\ninto the foundation of psychology. \n\n\nIn psychology it is precisely the connectedness that is originally and\ncontinually given in lived experience: life presents itself everywhere\nonly as a continuum or nexus. (1894/SW.II, 119\u201320) \n\n\nIt is the task of a descriptive and analytic psychology to explicate\nhow different processes converge in the nexus of consciousness. This\nnexus is lived and must be distinguished from the overall acquired\npsychic nexus discussed earlier. The lived nexus is available to\nreflexive awareness and can be described as itself an ongoing process.\nAnalysis then shows this process to have a rather uniform\ncross-sectional structure. Almost every momentary state of\nconsciousness can be seen \u201cto simultaneously contain some kind\nof representing, feeling, and willing\u201d (1894/SW.II, 173).\n\nIf we were merely representational beings, the conditions of psychic\nlife would be merely causal. But we at the same time estimate the\nvalue of what we represent through feeling. \n\n\nOnce external conditions evoke a sense of pressure or intensification\nin the sphere of feeling, a striving comes about to either maintain or\nto modify a given state. (1894/SW.II, 177) \n\n\nThe interest of feeling that attaches to aspects of what is\nexperienced allows us to value them as either favorable or unfavorable\nto our existence and sets the stage for the will to possibly act on\ntheir basis.\n\n\nTo the extent that the parts [of the experiential nexus] are connected\nstructurally so as to link the satisfaction of the drives and\nhappiness and to reject suffering, we call this nexus purposive. It is\nsolely in psychic structure that the character of purposiveness is\noriginally given, and when we attribute this to an organism or to the\nworld, this concept is only transferred from inner lived experience.\nEvery relation of parts to a whole attains the character of\npurposiveness from the value that is realized in it. This value is\nexperienced only in the life of feelings and drives. (1894/SW.II,\n178)\n\n\nPsychic life is not constructed synthetically from discrete elements,\nbut is always already a continuum that is constantly differentiating\nitself from within. By describing and analyzing this continuum Dilthey\nbrings out the breadth and depth of its scope and articulates it as a\nstructural nexus. And as he considers the temporal development of this\nnexus, he further defines its purposiveness. Although the cognitive\nand volitional subsystems of mental life may posit external ends, the\naffective and overall psychic nexus displays what Kant called a\npurposiveness without a determinant purpose. The overall acquired\npsychic nexus exhibits a teleology that does not posit any final\ntelos to which all previous stages are to be subsumed. The\npurposiveness of mental life is immanent and adaptive rather than\nexternal and predetermined. Each stage of our life can be understood\nas an epoch with its distinctive value.\n\nNothing can be more erroneous than viewing maturity as the goal of the\ndevelopment that constitutes life and thus transforming the early\nyears into mere means. How could those years serve as means to a goal\nwhich in each case is so uncertain? Instead, it is part of the nature\nof life to strive to fill each moment with a richness of value.\n(1894/SW.II, 189)\n\n\nA further task of Dilthey\u2019s descriptive and analytic psychology\nis to show how the development of the psychic nexus produces the\nindividuation of human life. Individuality is not conceived in terms\nof unique qualities that we are endowed with, but as something that\neach of us acquires historically. It is embodied in what was referred\nto earlier as a subject\u2019s acquired psychic nexus and is only\ngradually articulated. Even when people share the same qualities their\nrelative intensity will differ. Sometimes qualities are present to\nsuch a small extent as to be, in effect, unnoticeable. Prominent\nqualities, however, tend to reinforce certain related qualities and\nsuppress others. Each individual can thus be understood as a\nstructural configuration of a set of dominant qualities in tension\nwith some subordinate qualities. This tension may be unresolved for a\nlong time until finally some articulation or Gestalt is\nreached that defines a person\u2019s character. Dilthey gives the\nexample of strong ambition leading someone to gradually overcome\nshyness in public. Once a person recognizes that low self-confidence\nwhen speaking in public stands in the way of an important goal being\nfulfilled, that person can begin to cultivate the requisite\nqualities.\n\nThe initial response to Dilthey\u2019s descriptive psychology was\nmixed. Hermann Ebbinghaus wrote an extended review which claimed that\nDilthey still relies on hypotheses and that the differences between\nexplanative and descriptive psychologies are minimal. Dilthey defended\nhis position by showing that he never meant to banish explanative\nhypotheses from psychology altogether, merely from its descriptive\nfoundations. Husserl later expressed his regret that the Ebbinghaus\nreview deflected him from reading this \u201cgenial\u201d\nanticipation of phenomenology until much later.\n\nAnother kind of criticism came from the Neo-Kantians, most of whom\nwanted to completely divorce philosophy from psychology. In 1894 the\nBaden School Neo-Kantian Wilhelm Windelband delivered a lecture in\nwhich he claimed that psychology has no real relevance for the\nhistorical sciences and should be considered a natural science rather\nthan a human science. Windelband sees psychology as searching for laws\njust as the natural sciences do and historical studies as interested\nin unique patterns. Thus he proposed that the natural sciences are\nnomothetic and the historical or cultural sciences ideographic.\nDilthey in turn rejected Windelband\u2019s distinction by showing\nthat many natural sciences have ideographic elements and many human\nsciences such as linguistics and economics have nomothetic aims.\nMoreover, Dilthey argued that the description of singular historical\ndata only becomes meaningful if understood in the framework of\nregularities: \u201cWhat is most characteristic of the systematic\nhuman sciences is the connection of the general and the\nindividual \u201d (1895\u20136/SW.II, 227). Not only is it the\ncase that universal considerations are as important as ideographic\nspecificity, but also the understanding of individuality is not\npossible without reference to some broader context.\n",
