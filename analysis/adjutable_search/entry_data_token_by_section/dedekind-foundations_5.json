    "main_text": "Other Mathematical Contributions || Algebraic Number Theory\n4.1 Algebraic Number Theory\n\nWhile historians of mathematics have long emphasized the influence\nthat Dedekind\u2019s contributions to algebraic number theory had on the\ndevelopment of twentieth-century mathematics, the philosophical\nsignificance of these contributions has only started to be probed\nrecently (with some early exceptions: Dugac 1976, Sinaceur 1979,\nEdwards 1980, 1983, Stein 1988). We should begin here by reviewing two\nrelated aspects: the roots of Dedekind\u2019s number-theoretic\ninvestigations in the works of Gauss, Dirichlet, and Ernst Kummer; and\nthe contrast between Dedekind\u2019s approach and that of Leopold\nKronecker.\n\nThe starting point for these number theorists is the solution of\nalgebraic equations, especially their solution in terms of integers. A\nfamous example is Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem, which concerns the\n(non-)solubility of the equation \\(x^n + y^n = z^n\\) by integers, for\ndifferent exponents \\(n\\). The approach to the problem developed by\nGauss, clarified and refined by Dirichlet, and pushed further by\nKummer involves considering extensions of the (field of) rational\nnumbers, as well as of the (ring of) \u201cintegers\u201d contained\nin such extensions. Thus, Gauss studied the \u201cGaussian\nintegers\u201d (\\(a + bi\\), where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are regular\nintegers and \\(i = \\sqrt{-1}\\)) within the field of all complex\nnumbers; Kummer considered more complicated \u201ccyclotomic\nintegers\u201d in corresponding cyclotomic number fields (Edwards\n1977, Stillwell 2000, Gray 2018).\n\nWhat became clear along such lines is that in some of these extensions\nthe Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic\u2014asserting the unique\nfactorization of all integers into powers of primes\u2014fails. If it\nhad been available generally, solutions to important problems would\nhave been within reach, including Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem. The question\nbecame, then, whether a suitable alternative to the Fundamental\nTheorem could be found. Kummer\u2019s response, obtained in a close study\nof certain particular cases, was to introduce \u201cideal\ndivisors\u201d in terms of which unique factorization could be\nrecovered. While this move led to striking progress, the precise\nnature of these new mathematical objects was left unclear, as were the\nbasis for their introduction and the range of applicability of the\ntechnique.\n\nBoth Dedekind and Kronecker knew this earlier work well, especially\nKummer\u2019s, and they tried to build on it. Kronecker\u2019s strategy was to\nexamine in concrete detail, and by exploiting computational aspects,\ncertain kinds of extensions. Crucial for him was to proceed\nfinitistically and constructively, thus in a self-consciously\nrestricted way. This led to his \u201cdivisor theory\u201d, an\nextension of Gauss\u2019 and Kummer\u2019s \u201ctheory of forms\u201d\n(Edwards 1980, 1990). Dedekind, in contrast, approached the issue in a\nmore encompassing and abstract way. He considered algebraic number\nfields in general, thereby introducing the notion of a\n\u201cfield\u201d for the first time (Edwards 1983, Haubrich 1992,\nStillwell 1996, 1999, Ullrich 2017, Gray 2018).\n\nDedekind also replaced Kummer\u2019s \u201cideal \nnumbers\u201d by his\n\u201cideals\u201d\u2014set-theoretically constructed objects\nintended to play the same role with respect to unique factorization.\nDedekindian ideals are infinite subsets of the number fields in\nquestion, or of the ring of integers contained in them, which again\ngives his approach an infinitary character. (An ideal I in a\nring R is a subset such that the sum and difference of any\ntwo elements of I and the product of any element of\nI with any element of R are also in I.)\nThis led him to introduce other fruitful notions as well, such as that of a\n\u201cmodule\u201d. A particular \nproblem Dedekind struggled with for\nquite a while, in the sense of finding a fully satisfactory solution,\nwas to specify a suitable version, not only of the notion of\n\u201cinteger\u201d, but also of \u201cprime number\u201d\n(Ferreir\u00f3s 1999, ch. 3, Avigad 2006, Haffner 2014).\n\nBoth Kronecker, with his divisor theory, and Dedekind, with his ideal\ntheory, were able to obtain important results. Each theory also had a\nstrong influence on later developments\u2014Dedekind\u2019s by shaping the\napproaches to modern algebra (field theory, ring theory, etc.) of\nHilbert, Emmy Noether, B.L. van der Waerden, Emil Artin, Nicolas\nBourbaki, and others (Alten et al. 2003, Corry 2004, McLarty 2006,\nGray 2008, 2018); Kronecker\u2019s by influencing Hilbert\u2019s work as well,\nand by being revived later in, among others, Andr\u00e9 Weil\u2019s and\nAlexander Grothendieck\u2019s work (class field theory, algebraic geometry)\n(Weil 1950, Edwards 1990, Reed 1995, Corfield 2003). The contrast\nbetween their approaches provides a clear example\u2014historically\nthe first significant example\u2014of the opposition between\n\u201cclassical\u201d and \u201cconstructivist\u201d conceptions\nof mathematics.\n\nNot infrequently this opposition is debated in terms of which approach\nis \u201cthe right one\u201d, \nwith the implication that only one of\nthem but not the other is legitimate. (This started with Dedekind and\nKronecker. We already noted that Dedekind explicitly rejected\nconstructivist strictures on his work, although he did not rule out\ncorresponding projects as illegitimate in themselves. Kronecker, with\nhis strong opposition to the use of set-theoretic and infinitary\ntechniques, went further in the other direction.) But another question\nis more basic: Can the contrast between the two approaches to\nalgebraic number theory, or to mathematics more generally, be captured\nmore sharply and insightfully; and in particular, what is its\nmethodological and epistemological significance?\n\nAn initial, rough answer to that question is already contained in our\ndiscussion so far: Dedekind\u2019s approach is set-theoretic and\ninfinitary, while Kronecker\u2019s is constructivist and finitary. However,\nthat leaves us with a deeper issue: What exactly is it that a\nset-theoretic and infinitary methodology allows us to accomplish that\nKronecker\u2019s doesn\u2019t, and vice versa? The specific strength of\na Kroneckerian approach is often summed up thus: It provides us with\ncomputational, algorithmic information (Edwards 1980, 1990, Avigad\n2008). But what is the characteristic virtue of a Dedekindian\napproach? Here an informative and articulate answer is harder to find,\nespecially one that is philosophically satisfying.\n\nWhat tends to get in the way is that the set-theoretic and infinitary\nmethodology Dedekind championed was so successful, and shaped\ntwentieth-century mathematics so much, that it is hard to reach the\nanalytic distance needed. Often all one gets, then, are platitudes:\nthat it is very \u201cgeneral\u201d and \u201cabstract\u201d. Or\none is left with negative characterizations: that it fails to be\nfinitistically and constructively acceptable. Beyond that, there is\nthe suggestion that Dedekind\u2019s approach is\n\u201cstructuralist\u201d. \nBut as this term is now used to\ncharacterize a methodology, rather than a metaphysical position, one\nwonders what exactly it involves. Before attempting a clarification and\nelaboration, let us briefly consider some of Dedekind\u2019s other\nmathematical works, since this will make certain crucial features\nstand out more.\n",
