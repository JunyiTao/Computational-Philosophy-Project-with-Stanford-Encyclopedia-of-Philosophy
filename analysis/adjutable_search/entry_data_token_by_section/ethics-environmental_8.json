    "main_text": "Wilderness, the Built Environment, Poverty and Politics\n6. Sustainability and Climate Change \n\nThe Convention on Biological Diversity discussed in the supplementary\ndocument on\n Biodiversity Preservation\n was influenced by\n Our Common Future,\n an earlier United Nations document on sustainability produced by the\nWorld Commission on Environment and Development (WCED 1987). The\ncommission was chaired by Gro Harlem Brundtland, Prime Minister of\nNorway at the time, and the report is sometimes known as the\nBrundtland Report. This report noted the increasing tide of evidence\nthat planetary systems vital to supporting life on earth were under\nstrain. The key question it raised is whether it is equitable to\nsacrifice options for future well-being in favour of supporting\ncurrent lifestyles, especially the comfortable, and sometimes lavish,\nforms of life enjoyed in the rich countries. As Bryan Norton puts it,\nthe world faces a global challenge to see whether different human\ngroups, with widely varying perspectives, can perhaps \u201caccept\nresponsibility to maintain a non-declining set of opportunities based\non possible uses of the environment\u201d. The preservation of\noptions for the future can be readily linked to notions of equity if\nit is agreed that \u201cthe future ought not to face, as a result of\nour actions today, a seriously reduced range of options and choices,\nas they try to adapt to the environment that they face\u201d (Norton\n2001: 419). Note that references to \u201cthe future\u201d need not\nbe limited to the future of human beings only. In keeping with the\nnon-anthropocentric focus of much environmental philosophy, a care for\nsustainability and biodiversity can embrace a care for opportunities\navailable to non-human living things.\n\nHowever, when the concept \u201csustainable development\u201d was\nfirst articulated in the Brundtland Report, the emphasis was clearly\nanthropocentric. In face of increasing evidence that planetary systems\nvital to life-support were under strain, the concept of sustainable\ndevelopment is constructed in the report to encourage certain globally\ncoordinated directions and types of economic and social development.\nThe report defines \u201csustainable development\u201d in the\nfollowing way:\n\n\nSustainable development is development that meets the needs of the\npresent without compromising the ability of future generations to meet\ntheir own needs. It contains within it two key concepts:\n\nthe concept of \u201cneeds\u201d, in particular the essential\nneeds of the world\u2019s poor, to which overriding priority should\nbe given; and\nthe idea of limitations imposed by the state of technology and\nsocial organization on the environment\u2019s ability to meet present\nand future needs.\n\n\nThus the goals of economic and social development must be defined in\nterms of sustainability in all countries\u2014developed or\ndeveloping, market-oriented or centrally planned. Interpretations will\nvary, but must share certain general features and must flow from a\nconsensus on the basic concept of sustainable development and on a\nbroad strategic framework for achieving it. (WCED 1987, Ch. 2,\nparagraphs 1\u20132)\n\n\nThe report goes on to argue that \u201cthe industrial world has\nalready used much of the planet\u2019s ecological capital. This\ninequality is the planet\u2019s main \u2018environmental\u2019\nproblem; it is also its main \u2018development\u2019 problem\u201d\n(WCED 1987, Overview, paragraph 17). In the concept of sustainable\ndevelopment the report combines the resource economist\u2019s notion\nof \u201csustainable yield\u201d with the recognition that\ndeveloping countries of the world are entitled to economic growth and\nprosperity. The notion of sustainable yield involves thinking of\nforests, rivers, oceans and other ecosystems, including the natural\nspecies living in them, as a stock of \u201cecological capital\u201d\nfrom which all kinds of goods and services flow. Provided the flow of\nsuch goods and services does not reduce the capacity of the capital\nitself to maintain its productivity, the use of the systems in\nquestion is regarded as sustainable. Thus, the report argues that\n\u201cmaximum sustainable yield must be defined after taking into\naccount system-wide effects of exploitation\u201d of ecological\ncapital (WCED 1987, Ch. 2, paragraph 11).\n\nThere are clear philosophical, political and economic precursors to\nthe Brundtland concept of sustainability. For example, John Stuart\nMill (1848, IV. 6. 1) distinguished between the \u201cstationary\nstate\u201d and the \u201cprogressive state\u201d and argued that\nat the end of the progressive state lies the stationary state, since\n\u201cthe increase of wealth is not boundless\u201d. Mill also\nrecognized a debt to the gloomy prognostications of Thomas Malthus,\nwho had conjectured that population tends to increase geometrically\nwhile food resources at best increase only arithmetically, so that\ndemand for food will ultimately outstrip the supply (see Milgate and\nStimson 2009, Ch. 7, and the discussion of Malthus in the Political\nEconomy section of the Spring 2016 version of the entry on\n Mill).\n Reflection on Malthus led Mill to argue for restraining human\npopulation growth:\n\nEven in a progressive state of capital, in old countries, a\nconscientious or prudential restraint on population is indispensable,\nto prevent the increase of numbers from outstripping the increase of\ncapital, and the condition of the classes who are at the bottom of\nsociety from being deteriorated (Mill 1848, IV. 6. 1).\n\n\nSuch warnings resonate with pessimism about increasing human\npopulation and its impact on the poorest people, as well as on loss of\nbiodiversity, fresh water scarcity, overconsumption and climate\nchange. In their controversial work The Population Bomb, Paul\nand Anne Ehrlich, argue that without restrictions on population\ngrowth, including the imposition of mandatory birth control, the world\nfaced \u201cmass starvation\u201d in the short term (Ehrlich 1968).\nThis prediction was not fulfilled. In a subsequent defence of their\nearly work, the Ehrlichs declared that the most serious flaw in their\noriginal analysis \u201cwas that it was much too optimistic about the\nfuture\u201d, and comment that \u201cSince The Bomb was written,\nincreases in greenhouse gas flows into the atmosphere, a consequence\nof the near doubling of the human population and the near tripling of\nglobal consumption, indicate that the results will likely be\ncatastrophic climate disruption caused by greenhouse heating\u201d\n(Ehrlich and Ehrlich 2009, 66). It was also in 1968 that Garrett\nHardin published his much cited article on the \u201ctragedy of the\ncommons\u201d arguing that common resources can always be subject to\ndegradation and extinction in the face of the rational pursuit of\nself-interest. For Hardin, the increasing pressure on shared\nresources, and increasing pollution, are inevitable results of the\nfact that \u201cthere is no technical solution to the population\nproblem\u201d (Hardin 1968). The problem may be analysed from the\nperspective of the so-called\n prisoner\u2019s dilemma\n (also see the entry on the\n free rider problem).\n Despite the pessimism of writers at the time, and the advocacy of\nsetting limits to population growth, there was also an optimism that\nechoes Mill\u2019s own view that a \u201cstationary state\u201d\nwould not be one of misery and decline, but rather one in which humans\ncould aspire to more equitable distribution of available and limited\nresources. This is clear not only among those who recognize limits to\neconomic growth (Meadows et al. 1972) but also among those who\nchampion the move to a steady state economy (Daly 1991) or at least\nwant to see more account taken of ecology in economics (Norgaard 1994,\nRees 2020).\n\nThe Brundtland report puts less emphasis on limits than do Mill,\nMalthus and later writers. It depicts sustainability as a challenge\nand opportunity for the world to become more socially, politically and\nenvironmentally fair. In pursuit of\n intergenerational justice,\n it suggests that there should be new human rights added to the\nstandard list, for example, that \u201cAll human beings have the\nfundamental right to an environment adequate for their health and well\nbeing\u201d (WCED 1987, Annexe 1, paragraph 1). The report also\nargues that \u201cThe enjoyment of any right requires respect for the\nsimilar rights of others, and recognition of reciprocal and even joint\nresponsibilities. States have a responsibility towards their own\ncitizens and other states\u201d (ibid., chapter 12, paragraph 83).\nSince the report\u2019s publication, many writers have supported and\ndefended the view that global and\n economics [normative] and economic justice\n require that nations which had become wealthy through earlier\nindustrialization and environmental exploitation should allow less\ndeveloped nations similar or equivalent opportunities for development\nespecially in term of access to environmental resources (Redclift\n2005). As intended by the report the idea of sustainable development\nhas become strongly integrated into the notion of environmental\nconservation. The report has also set the scene for a range of\nsubsequent international conferences, declarations, and protocols many\nof them maintaining the emphasis on the prospects for the future of\nhumanity, rather than considering sustainability in any wider\nsense.\n\nSome non-anthropocentric environmental thinkers have found the\nlanguage of economics used in the report unsatisfactory in its\nimplications since it already appears to assume a largely instrumental\nview of nature. The use of notions such as \u201casset\u201d,\n\u201ccapital\u201d and also the word \u201cresources\u201d in\nconnection with natural objects and systems has been identified by\nsome writers as instrumentalizing natural things which are in essence\nwild and free. The objection is that such language promotes the\ntendency to think of natural things as mere resources for humans or as\nraw materials with which human labour could be mixed, not only to\nproduce consumable goods, but also to generate human ownership\n(Plumwood 1993, Sagoff 2004). If natural objects and systems have\nintrinsic value independent of their possible use for humans, as many\nenvironmental philosophers have argued, then a policy approach to\nsustainability needs to consider the environment and natural things\nnot only in instrumental and but also in intrinsic terms to do justice\nto the moral standing that many people believe such items possess.\nDespite its acknowledgment of there being \u201cmoral, ethical,\ncultural, aesthetic, and purely scientific reasons for conserving wild\nbeings\u201d (WCED 1987, Overview, paragraph 53), the strongly\nanthropocentric and instrumental language used throughout the\nBrundtland report in articulating the notion of sustainable\ndevelopment can be criticised for defining the notion too narrowly,\nleaving little room for addressing sustainability questions directly\nconcerning the Earth\u2019s environment and its non-human\ninhabitants: should, and if so, how should, human beings reorganise\ntheir ways of life and the social-political structures of their\ncommunities to allow sustainability and equity not only for all humans\nbut also for the other species on the planet?\n\nThe concern for preserving nature and non-human species is addressed\nto some extent by making a distinction between weaker and stronger\nconceptions of sustainability (Beckerman 1995). Proponents of weak\nsustainability argue that it is acceptable to replace natural capital\nwith human-made capital provided that the latter has equivalent\nfunctions. If, for example, plastic trees could produce oxygen, absorb\ncarbon and support animal and insect communities, then they could\nreplace the real thing, and a world with functionally equivalent\nartificial trees would seem just as good\u2014from an economic\nperpective\u2014as one with real or natural trees in it. For weak\nsustainability theorists, the aim of future development should be to\nmaintain a consistently productive stock of capital on which to draw,\nwhile not insisting that some portion of that capital be natural.\nStrong sustainability theorists, by contrast, generally resist the\nsubstitution of human for natural capital, insisting that a critical\nstock of natural things and processes be preserved. By so doing, they\nargue, rivers, forests and biodiverse systems are maintained, hence\nproviding maximum options\u2014options in terms of experience,\nappreciation, values, and ways of life\u2014for the future human\ninhabitants of the planet (Norton 2005). The Brundtland report can\nalso be seen as advocating a form of strong sustainability in so far\nas it recommends that a \u201cfirst priority is to establish the\nproblem of disappearing species and threatened ecosystems on political\nagendas as a major resource issue\u201d (ibid., chapter 6,\nparagraph 57). Furthermore, despite its instrumental and economic\nlanguage, the report in fact endorses a wider moral perspective on the\nstatus of and our relation to nature and non-human species, evidenced\nby its statement that \u201cthe case for the conservation of nature\nshould not rest only with development goals. It is part of our moral\nobligation to other living beings and future generations\u201d (WCED\n1987, chapter 2, paragraph 55). Implicit in the statement is not only\na strong conception of sustainability but also a non-anthropocentric\nconception of the notion. Over time, strong sustainability came to be\nfocused not only on the needs of human and other living things but\nalso on their rights (Redclift 2004, 218). In a further development,\nthe discourses on forms of sustainability have generally given way to\na more ambiguous usage, in which the term \u201csustainability\u201d\nfunctions to bring people into a debate rather than setting out a\nclear definition of the terms of the debate itself. As globalization\nleads to greater integration of world economies, the world after the\nBrundtland report has seen greater fragmentation among viewpoints,\nwhere critics of globalization have generally used the concept of\nsustainability in a plurality of different ways (Sneddon, Howarth and\nNorgaard 2006). Some have argued that \u201csustainability\u201d,\njust like the word \u201cnature\u201d itself, has come to mean very\ndifferent things, carrying different symbolic meanings for different\ngroups, and reflecting very different interests (Redclift 2004, 220).\nFor better or for worse, such ambiguity can on occasion allow\ndifferent parties in negotiations to claim a measure of agreement. For\nexample, commenting on the connections between agricultural systems,\nsustainability and climate change, one writer has argued that there is\nexciting scope for negotiation across different world views in working\nout the conditions for a future sustainable form of agriculture\n(Thompson 2017).\n\nMeadows\u2019 and Daly\u2019s arguments about the need to recognize\nthat planetary resources are limited have continued to resonate with\nthinkers, especially those working in ecological economics (Daly and\nFarley 2011). As one author puts it, \u201cthe overriding aim [of\necological economics] ... is to seek viable responses to the biggest\ndilemma of our times: reconciling our aspirations for the good life\nwith the limitations and constraints of a finite planet\u201d\n(Jackson 2017, 3). While economic growth is a central focus of\nneoclassical economic theory (see the entry on\n philosophy of economics)\n a minority of thinkers have joined in supporting an agenda of\n\u201cde-growth\u201d (or \u201cdegrowth\u201d) as an alternative\nto what is sometimes called \u201cgrowthism\u201d (for a popular\noverview see Hickel 2020). From small beginnings in the late 20th\ncentury, the idea of de-growth developed from \u201ca political\nslogan with theoretical implications\u201d to become a significant\nchallenge to the idea of sustainable development considered as a kind\nof sustainable growth (Martinez-Alier et al. 2010).\nAdvocates of de-growth advocate that the transition to sustainability\nwill be aided by pursuing de-growth instead of economic growth\n(D\u2019Alisa et al. 2015, Khamara and Kronenbeg 2020). At the same\ntime some ecological economists argue for a rejection of the\nanthropocentrism they claim is central to neoclassical economics and\nsupport embracing a new ecological economics that explicitly\nincorporates an ecological ethic (Washington and Maloney 2020). Having\ndrawn attention to the huge impact of the human ecological footprint,\nRees has gone on to gloomily ponder the kind of economics needed to\ndeal with a situation in which \u201cwe are currently\n\u2018financing\u2019 economic growth by liquidating the biophysical\nsystems upon which humanity ultimately depends\u201d (Rees 2020, 1).\nHe concludes that \u201cthe mainstream fantasy\u2026...this\nobsession with growth, cannot end well\u201d (ibid., 6).\nAssuming that some forms of consumption are important to a satisfying\nhuman life, some writers have explored the idea that developing more\nmodes of virtual consumption, while reducing physical forms of\nconsumption, might be a significant contribution to sustainable\nlifestyles (Pike and DesRoches 2020).\n\nThe preservation of opportunities to live well, or at least to have a\nminimally acceptable level of well being, is at the heart of\n population ethics\n and many contemporary conceptions of sustainability. Many people\nbelieve such opportunities for the existing younger generations, and\nalso for the yet to arrive future generations, to be under threat from\ncontinuing environmental destruction, including loss of fresh water\nresources, continued clearing of wild areas, decreasing biodiversity\nand a changing climate thus raising questions not only about\nsustainability but also about environmental justice (see Gonzalez,\nAtapattu, and Seck 2021). Of these, climate change has come to\nprominence as an area of intense policy and political debate, to which\napplied philosophers and ethicists were slow to contribute (Heath\n2021). An early exploration of the topic by John Broome shows how the\neconomics of climate change could not be divorced from considerations\nof intergenerational justice and ethics (Broome 1992), and this has\nset the scene for subsequent discussions and analyses (see the entry\non\n climate justice).\n More than a decade later, when Stephen Gardiner analyses the state of\naffairs surrounding climate change in an article entitled \u201cA\nPerfect Moral Storm\u201d (Gardiner 2006), his starting point is also\nthat ethics plays a fundamental role in all discussions of climate\npolicy. But he argues that even if difficult ethical and conceptual\nquestions facing climate change (such as the so-called\n \u201cnon-identity problem\u201d\n along with the notion of\n historic injustices)\n could be answered, it would still be close to politically and\nsocially impossible to formulate, let alone to enforce, policies and\naction plans to deal effectively with climate change. This is due to\nthe multi-faceted nature of a problem that involves vast numbers of\nagents and players. At a global level, there is first of all the\npractical problem of motivating shared responsibilities (see the entry\non\n moral motivation)\n in part due to the dispersed nature of greenhouse gas emissions which\nmakes the effects of increasing levels of atmospheric carbon and\nmethane not always felt most strongly in the regions where they\noriginate. Add to this the fact that there is an un-coordinated and\nalso dispersed network of agents\u2014both individual and\ncorporate\u2014responsible for greenhouse gas emissions, and that\nthere are no effective institutions that can control and limit them.\nBut this tangle of issues constitutes, Gardiner argues, only one\nstrand in the skein of quandaries that confronts us. There is also the\nfact that by and large only the future (and perhaps the current\nyounger) generations will carry the brunt of the impacts of climate\nchange, explaining why so many people in the current generations seem\nnot to have strong enough incentive to act. Finally, he argues it is\nevident that mainstream political, economic, and ethical models are\nnot up to the task of reaching global consensus, and in many cases not\neven national consensus, on how best to design and implement fair\nclimate policies. Some consequentialist theorists, however, have\nargued that a form of\n rule consequentialism\n can take account of the interests of future generations who may be\ninhabiting a \"broken world\" (Mulgan 2011, 2017). Mulgan argues that by\nimagining a broken world of limited resources and precarious human\nsurvival, it may be possible to devise an ideal moral ooutlook that\ndiffers from the ideal code of many rule consequentialists who usually\npresuppose that the future will be just like the present.\n\nHowever, Gardiner takes a pessimistic view of the prospects for\nprogress on climate issues. His view includes pessimism about\ntechnical solutions, such as geoengineering as the antidote to climate\nproblems, echoing the concerns of others that large scale\ninterventions in\u2014and further domination of\u2014nature may turn\nout to be an even worse climate catastrophe (Gardiner 2011, ch 11,\nJamieson 1996 and see also the papers in Gardiner and McKinnon 2020).\nA key point in Gardiner\u2019s analysis is that the problem of\nclimate change involves a tangle of issues, the complexity of which\nconspires to encourage buck-passing, weakness of will, distraction and\nprocrastination, \u201cmak[ing] us extremely vulnerable to moral\ncorruption\u201d (ibid., 397; cf. Gardiner 2011; see also\nthe concept of \u201cwicked problem\u201d in Brennan 2004). Because\nof the grave risk of serious harm to current and future generations of\npeople and other living things, our failure to take timely mitigating\nactions on climate issues can be seen as a major moral failing,\nespecially in the light of our current knowledge and understanding of\nthe problem (IPCC 2021).\n\nIn a related reinterpretation of a classic study in psychology,\nRussell and Bolton re-examine Milgram\u2019s classic \u201cobedience\nstudies\u201d (see the entry on\n the concept of evil,\n section 4.5). In these experiments, Milgram explored the conditions\nunder which ordinary people would be disposed to perform evil actions\n(such as administering electric shocks to strangers). Russell and\nBolton argue that, when properly interpreted, Milgram\u2019s studies\nshow that political, administrative and bureaucratic structures can\nlead to a general and tacit agreement for those in an advantaged\nsituation to harm the interests of those less powerful. In Russell and\nBolton\u2019s new interpretation of the Milgram experiments, those\nwho are in the advantaged situation are those living comfortably in\nwealthy countries, while the powerless are distant strangers and\nmembers of future generations. Corporate structures and long\norganizational chains, Russell and Bolton argue, encourage inaction,\ndenial and diffusion of responsibility that typifies both the common\nresponses to climate change and also the behaviour of participants in\nMilgram\u2019s experiments. They conjecture that Milgram\u2019s work\nthus explains the phenomenon of what they call \u201cresponsibility\nambiguity\u201d that underlies hesitancy to take action on climate\nchange (Russell and Bolton 2019, and see also Rees 2020). While they\nmake no mention of the work of Hannah Arendt, their analysis recalls\nsome of Arendt\u2019s analysis of the banality of evil (see the entry\non\n the concept of evil,\n section 2.3). There appears to be scope for more empirical research\nand interdisciplinary study on topics such as the diffusion of\nresponsibility and denialism. A similar analysis might also apply to\ninaction in the face of declining biodiversity.\n\nJohn Broome tries to show some of the ways that one form of climate\ndenialism takes, when it uses ingenious but, Broome claims, flawed\nreasoning to depict individuals as making no significant contribution\nto climate change (Broome 2019, see also McKinnon 2014). A stronger\nform of denialism refuses to acknowledge the fact of anthropogenic\nclimate change at all. A puzzle remains over why much ingenuity is\nexpended on such denial in the face of the urgent problems that now\nconfront the world (see the entry on\n science and pseudo-science).\n In response, some argue that the persisting denialism over the\nreality of the environmental and climate crises may be a product of\nshame or guilt over the human treatment of natural things and systems\n(Aaltola 2021). These emotions may interfere with and block a\nmuch-needed and honest confrontation of a frightening\nsituation\u2014even if it is one humans have brought upon themselves.\nThere is also a well-known psychological phenomenon of \u201cknowing\nbut not knowing\u201d which can contribute, along with other factors,\nto denialism (Norgaard 2011, 404, and compare the classic studyof this\nin Cohen 2001, ch. 2). Many countries\u2019 initial and ongoing\nresponse to the 2020s COVID-19 pandemic, for example, appears to show\nthat denialism, typically accompanied by widespread misinformation and\nunfounded hypotheses about conspiracies, may be a very human way to\nreact in the face of a global catastrophe. Using factor analysis\nstudies, some psychologists have claimed to demonstrate that\nanti-scientific views have close association with beliefs in\ncreationism and animism. Further, they conjecture that purposive or\nteleological thinking is the gateway to such associations\n(Wagner-Egger et al. 2018). Note that the role of\n teleological notions in biology\n remains contested and subject to further research. Other research\nclaims to show that people simply reject scientific findings that make\nthem uncomfortable and threaten their worldviews (see Lewandowsky and\nOberauer 2016).\n\nWriters have also tried to make sense of why so much misinformation\nabout climate change and other catastrophes is so widespread. On the\npart of some theorists (see McIntyre 2018), the blame for the evils of\na \u201cpost-truth\u201d era has been laid at the feet of some\npostmodern thinkers who endorse\n social epistemology.\n But social constructionist writers have their own diagnosis of the\nsocial forces that have given rise to the \u201cnew climatic\nregime\u201d (Latour 2017), which combines science denialism and what\nhas be called \u201cout-of-this-world\u201d\u2014fanciful and\nover-optimistic\u2014thinking about the human prospects for escaping\nclimate catastrophe. One suggested remedy for these cognitve failings\nis to encourage the recognition that natural systems respond to human\naction and are not merely the material resources for economic\ndevelopment. It has been proposed that awareness that humans and the\nnatural systems that support them share a dwelling place might pave\nthe way to a new kind of \u201cterrestrial politics\u201d (Lenton\nand Latour 2018, Latour 2018). The shape of such a politics is still\nunder-theorized, and could take many forms (Mann and Wainwright 2018).\nMeanwhile, some animal ethicists blame \u201cspeciesist\nanthropocentrism\u201d (see the entry on\n the moral status of animals)\n for blinding humanity to the evils of its overpopulation and\ndenialism (Almiron and Tafalla 2019). Whatever the future holds, many\nthinkers insist that solving the problem of climate change is an\nessential ingredient of sustainability and that the alternative to\ndecisive action may result in the degrading not only of nature and\nnatural systems, but also of human dignity itself (see Nanda (ed.)\n2011, especially chapters by Heyd, Balafrej, Gutrich and Brennan and\nLo, see also section 3.4 of the entry on\n human rights).\n As humanity faces an uncertain future of declining biodiversity and\nincreasing extreme weather events driven by escalating planetary\nheating\u2014causing suffering and alienation for humans and\nnon-humans alike\u2014the moral challenges listed at the start of\nthis entry seem more pressing than ever.\n\nSupplementary Document:\n\nPathologies of Environmental Crisis: Theories and Empirical Research\n\n",
