    "main_text": "\n\nFrancisco Su\u00e1rez\n (1548\u20131617)[1]\n was a highly influential philosopher and theologian of the Second\nScholastic (or \u201cEarly Modern Scholasticism\u201d), that is, the\nrevitalized philosophical and theological inquiry of the sixteenth and\nseventeenth centuries, conducted within the tradition shaped by Thomas\nAquinas, Duns Scotus, and other medieval scholastics. While\nSu\u00e1rez is commonly praised for his comprehensive, exhaustive,\nand systematic exposition of more or less everything known in\nphilosophy up to his time (certainly, at any rate, in metaphysics),\nhis achievement in this regard should not be permitted to overshadow\nthe depth, power, and originality of his own ideas. He worked in a\ngreat variety of fields, including metaphysics, natural theology,\nphilosophy of mind, philosophy of action, ethics, political\nphilosophy, and law. In all these areas he made contributions the\ninfluences of which are so widespread and commonplace that they\nsometimes escape notice. Still, it is noteworthy that figures as\ndistinct from one another in place, time, and philosophical\norientation as Leibniz, Grotius, Pufendorf, Schopenhauer, and\nHeidegger, all found reason to cite him as a source of inspiration and\ninfluence. Grotius, for instance, praised the Jesuit doctor as a\ntheologian and philosopher of such depth, breadth, and penetration\nthat \u201che hardly had an equal\u201d (Grotius, Letter of 15\nOctober, 1633; 2001: 194).  See the entry on the\n School of Salamanca for\nmore context.\n",
