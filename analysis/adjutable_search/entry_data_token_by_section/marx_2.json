    "main_text": "Life and Writings || Brussels\n1.3 Brussels\n\nBetween early 1845 and early 1848, Marx lived in Brussels, the capital\nof a rapidly industrialising Belgium. A condition of his residency was\nto refrain from publishing on contemporary politics, and he was\neventually expelled after political demonstrations involving foreign\nnationals took place. In Brussels Marx published The Holy\nFamily (1845), which includes contributions from his new friend\nand close collaborator Friedrich Engels (1820\u20131895), continuing\nthe attack on Bruno Bauer and his followers. Marx also worked, with\nEngels, on a series of manuscripts now usually known as The German\nIdeology (1845\u201346), a substantial section of which\ncriticises the work of Max Stirner (1806\u20131856). Marx also wrote\nand published The Poverty of Philosophy (1847) which\ndisparages the social theory of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon\n(1809\u20131865). All these publications characteristically show Marx\ndeveloping and promoting his own views through fierce critical attacks\non contemporaries, often better-known and more established than\nhimself.\n\nMarx was politically active throughout his adult life, although the\nevents of 1848\u2014during which time he returned to Paris and\nCologne\u2014inspired the first of two periods of especially intense\nactivity. Two important texts here are The Communist\nManifesto (1848) which Marx and Engels published just before the\nFebruary Revolution, and, following his move to London, The Class\nStruggles in France (1850) in which Marx examined the subsequent\nfailure of 1848 in France. Between these two dates, Marx commented on,\nand intervened in, the revolution in Germany through the Neue\nRheinische Zeitung (1848\u201349), the paper he helped to\nestablish and edit in Cologne.\n",
