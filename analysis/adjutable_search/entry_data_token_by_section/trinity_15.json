    "main_text": "Three-self Theories || Material Monotheism\n2.6 Material Monotheism\n\nChristopher Hughes (2009) suggests a theory much like the Constitution\ntheory (section\n 2.1.2\n above) but without its controversial claim that there can be\nnumerical sameness without identity. On this picture,\n\n\u2026we have just one (bit of?) divine \u201cmatter,\u201d three\ndivine forms, and three (\u201cpartially overlapping,\u201d\nmaterially indiscernible but formally discernible divine hylomorphs\n[compounds of form and matter]. \u2026\u201cdivine person\u201d is\ntrue of the three hylomorphs, but\u2026 \u201cGod\u201d is true of\nthe (one and only) (bit of?) \u201cdivine matter.\u201d (2009, 309)\n\n\nOn this theory, \u201cThe Father is God,\u201d means that the Father\nhas God for his matter, or that the Father is \u201cmateriated\nby\u201d God, and \u201cThe Father is the same God as the Son\u201d\nmeans that these two are materiated by the same God\n(309\u201310).\n\nAn objection is that the one God of Christianity is not supposed to be\na portion of matter. Hughes replies that perhaps it is\northodox to say that God is a very unusual kind of matter (310).\n\nAlternately, Hughes suggests a retreat from matter terminology, and\nargues that Persons of the Trinity can\u2019t bear the same relation\nthey bear to one another that each bears to God. That is, it\ncan\u2019t be correct, for example, that Father and Son are\nconsubstantial, and that the Father and God are consubstantial. The\nreason is that for two things to be consubstantial is for there to be\nsomething which both are \u201csubstantiated\u201d or\n\u201censubstanced\u201d by. They are consubstantial\nbecause they both bear this other relation to a third,\nsubstantiating thing. Thus, e.g. \u201cThe Father is God\u201d means\n\u201cThe Father is (a person of the substance) God.\u201d Thus,\neven though Father and Son are numerically two, still it can be true\nthat \u201cThere is just one (substance) God\u201d (311).\n\nOn this alternate view, though, what does it mean to say that God is\nthe substance of a divine Person? Hughes suggests that the case is\nanalogous to material objects. A sweater and some wool thread are\n\u201cco-materiate\u201d in that both are \u201cmateriated\u201d\nor \u201cenmattered\u201d by one portion of matter, though they are\nnumerically distinct (311; cf. 313). Hughes suggests it is an open\nquestion whether this is a different theory, or just a restatement of\nthe first \u201cin more traditional theological terminology.\u201d\nIt will be the latter \u201cIf we can stretch the notion of\n\u2018matter\u2019 far enough to cover God, and stretch the notion\nof material substance (aka hylomorph) far enough to cover the divine\npersons\u201d (312). Hughes ends on a negative mysterian note (see\nsection\n 4.1\u00a0below),\n claiming that it is an advantage of this last account that\nensubstancement is \u201ca (very, though not entirely) mysterious\nrelation\u201d (313).\n\nLeftow (2018) objects that this theory features four things which are\ndivine, which is at least one too many. Further, on this account God\nhas but the Persons lack the divine attribute of aseity, which makes\nthe Persons \u201cat best only second-class deities\u201d (10).\n",
