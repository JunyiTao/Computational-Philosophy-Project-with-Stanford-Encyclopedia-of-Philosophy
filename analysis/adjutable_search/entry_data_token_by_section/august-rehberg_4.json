Dispute with Kant\n\n In the late 1780s, before his encounter with Reinhold, Rehberg took\npart in some of the heated debates surrounding Kant's critical\nphilosophy.  He was both an admirer and critic of Kant.  While he\ndefended Kant against the polemics of the Wolffians, he also wrote a\ncritical review of the second Kritik, which was widely read in\nhis\n day.[41]\n But the review of the second Kritik was\nonly the first skirmish of a greater battle.  Rehberg realized that\nhis case against revolutionary ideology could triumph only if he\ndefeated Kant.  For Kant's ethical rationalism gave a strong\nphilosophical foundation for the doctrines of Rousseau, which had been\nsuch an inspiration for the radicals in France.  Some of Kant's basic\nconcepts\u2014the categorical imperative and moral autonomy\u2014 seemed\npost facto rationalization for Rousseau's social contract\ntheory and republicanism.  What was only a feeling or intuition in\nRousseau became a concept or principle in Kant.  These implications of\nKant's doctrines became explicit in 1793 when Kant published his\nfamous \u2018Theory-Practice\u2019 essay in the Berlinische\n Monatsschrift.[42]\n Here Kant argued that there is no\ngap between theory and practice in politics, and that reason is\npractical in political as well as moral life.  He maintained that the\nprinciples of morality, which are determined by pure reason alone, are\nalso binding in politics, and that pure reason provides the basis for\na republican constitution involving the principles of liberty,\nequality and independence.  Kant's theses were a direct challenge to\nRehberg, who had made the gap between theory and practice the\nleitmotif of his critique of the Revolution.  Sooner or later,\nthen, he would have to reckon with the sage of K\u00f6nigsberg.  His\nreply to Kant duly appeared in the Berlinische\nMonatsschrift in February\n 1794.[43]\n\n\n Rehberg began his essay by expressing his agreement with the basic\nprinciples of Kant's moral philosophy.  Unlike many opponents of\nKant's moral theory, Rehberg was not an empiricist in ethics.  He\nflatly denied that utility could settle matters of\n right,[44]\n\nand he held that the first principles of morality have to be\nestablished independent of experience, apart from any knowledge of the\nconsequences of acting upon them.  It was Kant's great merit, Rehberg\ndeclares, to have shown that the first principle of morality\u2014\n\u2018Act so that the maxim of your will becomes a universal\nlaw\u2019\u2014is determinable by pure reason alone.  Where Rehberg\ndisagrees with Kant is in his attempt to establish specific\nmoral and political maxims from the first principle of morality.  Like\nmany later critics of Kant, Rehberg maintains that the categorical\nimperative is a purely formal principle, insufficient to determine the\ncontent of our specific duties.  The categorical imperative amounts to\nnothing more than the general demand that our principles be\nuniversalizable, that they hold for everyone alike without exception,\nor that we treat like cases alike (117-118).  As such it provides a\nmerely negative condition for accepting a moral principle; the problem\nis that it does not provide a positive criterion to distinguish\nbetween the many maxims that satisfy this condition.  The principle is\nstill compatible with many different maxims, all of which are\nuniversalizable.  \n\n But why is the categorical imperative such a formal principle?  Why\ncannot it derive any of our more specific duties?  Rehberg's argument\nhere becomes somewhat blurred and confused.  While his intention is to\nshow that the categorical imperative is a purely formal principle,\nsome of his arguments tend to demonstrate not its formality but the\nimpossibility of acting according to it in the real empirical world.\nIt is one thing to show that the categorical imperative is not\npractical because it cannot determine specific duties; it is another\nthing to show that it is not practical because no one in the real\nworld could act according to it, whether it derives specific duties or\nnot.  All told, Rehberg's polemic against Kant is an extraordinary\nmixture of insight and confusion.  We can best summarize it in the\nfollowing points:\n\nIf the categorical imperative is to derive any specific\nduties, it must tell us how to act in the empirical world.  Yet pure\nreason can never determine a priori anything regarding the empirical\nworld; hence the categorical imperative cannot determine any of our\nspecific duties.  Thus, for Rehberg, the dualism between the a priori\nand a posteriori in Kant's philosophy entails that the first principle\nof morality must be formal (119-120).\nYet this argument seems to suppose that because the categorical\nimperative cannot derive the content of a principle\u2014how we should act\nin specific circumstances\u2014it cannot determine its form\u2014whether it is\nobligatory, permissible or forbidden.  Kant always recognized,\nhowever, that the particular content of a maxim has to be derived from\nexperience.  All that must be derived a priori is its form. Hence on\nthis score Rehberg's critique missed its mark.\nKant is right to hold that the first principle of morality\nis that man ought to be treated as an end in himself.  However, once\nwe examine the presuppositions of this principle, it becomes clear\nthat it is severely limited in its application to the real world.\nThis principle presupposes that everyone has a physical body that is\ntheir exclusive possession, which they are the sole master of, and\nwhich cannot be used by others as means to their ends.  Yet such a\npresupposition is rarely, if ever, fulfilled in daily life.  To\npreserve our bodies, it is sometimes necessary for people to use one\nanother, to be means for one another's ends (118-119).  The Kantian\nprinciple of morality as an end in itself is true only for a nation of\nangels, but not for human beings in the real world who depend on one\nanother to survive.  \nIn his \u2018Theory-Practice\u2019 Essay Kant attempts to\nderive from the categorical imperative the idea of equality before the\nlaw, or what he calls \u201cthe principle of equality\u201d:\nEach member of a state has rights of coercion in relation to\nothers.  This means that everyone should enjoy equal protection\nbefore the law; in other words, if you violate my rights I can\nprosecute you as you can prosecute me if I violate your rights.\nRehberg points out, however, that such a principle does not imply the\nradical view that everyone has equal rights; it entails only that\neveryone's rights must be equally respected, whatever the differences\nbetween them might be.  The principle is indeed compatible with the\ngreatest divergence in the extent and kind of rights (124).  \nKant's principle of freedom \u2014 Everyone can seek\nhappiness in their own manner as long as they do not interfere with a\nsimilar quest by others \u2014 applies to us only insofar as we are\nperfectly free beings who can live in complete independence of one\nanother.  But we are not such beings, because we depend on others\nsimply to survive.  What should these relations of dependence be?\nKant's principles offer no concrete guidance (124).\nAll these difficulties with Kant's moral theory show, Rehberg\nconcluded, that there is a gap between theory and practice, morals and\npolitics after all.  Kant's principles are either too general, so that\nthey do not determine the specific maxims by which we should live, or\nthey are too idealistic, incapable of application at all to the real\nworld.  If we are to determine our specific duties in the concrete\nworld, and if we are to determine the best constitution for our\ncountry, we have no recourse but considerations of utility.  We have\nto consider the needs of people in specific circumstances to ascertain\nwhich laws and policies are most beneficial.  In some cases, however,\neven utility does not work, because we will have to decide between\npolicies where the utility is indeterminable, incommensurable or\nequally balanced.  In these cases we have no choice but to act\naccording to convention or tradition (127).[45] \n\n",
