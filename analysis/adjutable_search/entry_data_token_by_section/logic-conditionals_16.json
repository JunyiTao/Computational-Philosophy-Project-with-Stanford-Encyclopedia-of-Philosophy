    "main_text": "Probabilistic Logics || Probabilities for compound conditionals\n5.4 Probabilities for compound conditionals\n\nStalnaker\u2019s Thesis is consistent for simple conditionals, but\nfails for conditionals of arbitrary complexity. A challenge is to\nextend Stalnaker\u2019s Thesis to more or less extended classes of\ncompound conditionals. Several proposals have been made toward that\ngoal. The associated literature is quite technical, however, and we\ngive only a few landmarks here. Important is that all the resulting\nsystems mentioned here conservatively extend Adams\u2019s basic\nlogic, namely system P (i.e., they preserve the same\naxioms for simple conditionals, though not necessarily for compound\nconditionals).\n\nVan Fraassen (1976) extends Stalnaker\u2019s Thesis to right-nested\nconditionals of the form \\(A> (B>C)\\) in which \\(A, B,C\\) are\nBoolean, and to left-nested conditionals \\((A>B)>C\\) with the\nsame restriction, and he can also deal with specific conjunctions and\ndisjunctions of conditionals. Van Fraassen\u2019s proposal involves a\nproduct space construction, relying on so-called Stalnaker-Bernoulli\nmodels, allowing him to assign probabilities to infinite sequences of\nworlds based on standard Stalnaker models. The construction is used in\nStalnaker and Jeffrey (1994) and extended in S. Kaufmann (2009). One\nnoteworthy aspect of the construction is that the probability of\nright-nested conditionals of the form \\(A>(B>C)\\) is not in all\ncases identical to the probability of \\((A\\wedge B) > C\\). McGee\n(1989) on the other hand proposes a distinct construction that does\nnot permit left-nested conditionals, but which is intended to secure\nthe law of import-export for right-nested conditionals (famously, by\ngiving up Modus Ponens for nested conditionals). Both approaches have\nsome probabilistic principles in common, however, for instance\n\n\\[\\Pr(A\\wedge (A>B))=\\Pr(A\\wedge B)\\]\n\n\nholds in both theories. For both approaches, moreover, the associated\nlogics are semantically interpretable starting from Stalnaker\u2019s\npossible world semantics. Bradley (2012) builds on the\nJeffrey-Stalnaker and McGee approaches to show that for simple\nconditionals Adams Thesis can be derived by assigning probabilities to\npairs of worlds, instead of just worlds. The probability of a pair\n\\((w_0,w_1)\\) represents the probability that \\(w_0\\) is the actual\nworld, and that \\(w_1\\) is its selected alternative given the\nantecedent under discussion (note that one needs such probabilities\nfor all potential antecedents). A generalization of this property to\nnested conditionals is outlined, with philosophical emphasis on the\nidea that the probability of a conditional does not depend on a single\nworld, but also on the nonfactual relations of counterfactual\ndependence between worlds.\n\nA related approach to iterated conditionals is based on the so-called\ncoherence approach to probability, coming from de Finetti\u2019s\nbetting view of probability (see Coletti & Scozzafava 1999; Gilio\n2002; Gilio & Sanfilippo 2014; and Pfeifer 2014 for an\nintroduction). The idea is that probability degrees can be attached to\nconditional events so long as they do not violate certain coherence\nconstraints on those bets (no sure losses or \u201cDutch\nbooks\u201d). In this framework the probability of an event is\ndefined in terms of the technical notion of prevision. The prevision\n\\(x\\) attached to \\(A>C\\) corresponds to the fact that\n\n\nfor every real number \\(s\\), you are willing to pay (resp., to\nreceive) an amount \\(sx\\) and to receive (resp., to pay) \\(s\\), or\n\\(0\\), or \\(sx\\), according to whether \\(A\\wedge C\\) is true, or\n\\(A\\wedge\\neg C\\) is true, or \\(\\neg A\\) is true (bet called off),\nrespectively. (Sanfilippo, Gilio, Over, & Pfeifer (2020 notation\nadapted))\n\n\nDepending on independence assumptions concerning basic propositions,\nprevisions can be defined not only for conjunctions of conditionals,\nbut also for various nested conditionals. A recent overview of results\nin that domain appears in Sanfilippo et al. (2020).\n",
