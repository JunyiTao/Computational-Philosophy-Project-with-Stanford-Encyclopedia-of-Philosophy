    "main_text": "Some criticisms\n8. Counterpart theory\nSo far, this entry focused on the general shape of Lewis\u2019s\nmetaphysics. In this section, we turn to one of Lewis\u2019s more specific\nmetaphysical doctrines: counterpart theory. We will begin with an\noverview of the theory, review its motivation, some applications, and\nthen turn to criticism and objections. In a supplementary document, we\nreview \n Counterpart-theoretic Semantics for Quantified Modal Logic.\n\nCounterpart theory was originally introduced in Lewis (1968) as a\nformal theory about possible worlds and their inhabitants, but the\nlabel quickly came to be used for a loosely defined approach towards\ntrans-world identity and the interpretation of modal or temporal\ndiscourse. For the modal case, the central idea is that a de\nre modal claim like \u2018Joe Biden might be immaterial\u2019\nis understood as saying that at some possible world, someone who\nsufficiently resembles Joe Biden in certain\nrespects\u2014a counterpart of Biden\u2014is\nimmaterial. Accordingly, \u2018Biden is necessarily material\u2019\nis understood as saying that all of Biden\u2019s counterparts at all\nworlds are material.\n\nWhile counterpart theory was Lewis\u2019s invention, it was also a\nproduct of its time, the 1960\u2019s, when quantified modal logic was\n\u201cin the air\u201d and questions about essentialism and the\nso-called problem of\n transworld identity\n gained attention (e.g.  Quine 1953, Hintikka\n 1962).[7]\n The counterpart-theoretic approach does, however, bear a striking\nsimilarity to certain views of Leibniz concerning essential and\naccidental\n properties.[8]\n (See Mondadori (1973) for a counterpart-theoretic interpretation of\nLeibniz.)\n8.1 Motivation and applications\n\nLewis assumed that modal statements in ordinary language can be\nanalysed in terms of quantification over possible worlds and\nindividuals: \u2018it is possible that there are talking\ndonkeys\u2019 is analysed as \u2018there are possible worlds at\nwhich there are talking donkeys\u2019.  Lewis\u2019s modal realism\npromises to turn this into a reductive analysis of\nmodality. Statements about what is or is not the case at some possible\nworld are ultimately reduced to non-modal statements.  That there is a\nworld with talking donkeys, for example, means that there is a\nspatiotemporally isolated aggregate of things that has a genuine\ntalking donkey as part.\n\nA problem now arises for de re statements about what is\npossible or necessary for a particular individual. Since Joe Biden\nmight have had three arms, there should be a world where he has three\narms. But if Biden were part of another world, then that\nworld and our world would have a part in common. Lewis denies that\ndifferent worlds can share parts. Even if we allowed for overlapping\nworlds, it is hard to see how the other world could have a three-armed\nBiden as a part, given that this part is also part of our world, where\nBiden has two arms (compare Lewis 1986e, 199ff.). So \u2018Biden\nmight have had three arms\u2019 is not analysed as stating that there\nis a world which contains a three-armed Biden as part. Rather, it says\nthat there is a world that contains a three-armed\nrepresentative or counterpart of Joe Biden.\n\nWhat makes one object a counterpart of another? According to Lewis,\nthis is a matter of qualitative similarity in certain respects: a\ncounterpart of Biden is an individual that sufficiently resembles the\nactual Biden in relevant respects, and more so than any other object\nin its world. Sometimes Lewis drops the second clause (e.g. Lewis\n1968, 114\u2013115), and at one point he merely suggests (without\nexplanation) that counterparthood \u201cusually involve[s]\nsimilarity\u201d (Lewis 1986e, 8).\n\nThe relevant respects of resemblance need not match intuitive\njudgements of overall similarity (Lewis 1986e, 254f.), and they can be\nhighly extrinsic. For example, they might give high weight to\nsomeone\u2019s origin (Lewis 1986e, 244f. and 252), or to a causal\nconnection to an epistemic subject (Lewis 1983e).\n\nLewis does not think there is a once-and-for all correct answer to\nwhich respects of resemblance are relevant. He rejects the idea that\nthings have primitive essences which somehow determine or constrain\nwhat is possible for them. Rather, it is ultimately up to us which\nrespects of similarity we prioritize. Often this choice is not fully\nsettled, leaving the counterpart relation vague and context-sensitive\n(see Lewis 1971, 209\u201311; Lewis 1973b, 41; Lewis 1983d, 42\u20133;\nLewis 1986e, 251\u20135; Lewis 2003, 27\u20138).\n\nFor example, Lewis suggests that when we talk about people, we often\nrequire the counterparts to have a very similar origin, while allowing\nfor different careers and lifespan. In such a context, we might judge\nthat Biden might have died as an infant. In other contexts, however,\nwe may wonder what would have been the case if Biden had been born to\ndifferent parents, relaxing the requirement of similar origin (see\ne.g., Lewis 1973b, 41).\n\nSince the counterpart relation is determined by similarity, everything\nis its own counterpart. Other than that, Lewis imposes few general\nrestrictions on the counterpart relation. In Lewis (1968), he suggests\nthat nothing can be a counterpart of a different object in the same\nworld, but this assumption is later dropped (Lewis 1986e, 232,\nfn.22). Unlike strict trans-world identity, counterparthood is not\nassumed to be transitive, symmetric, or functional. An object can have\nmultiple counterparts at a world, and different objects can have a\ncommon counterpart.\n\nLewis delivered counterpart theory as part of his modal realism, but\nthe core idea can be separated from this background, and even from the\nassumption of world-bound agents. (See e.g. Stalnaker 1986,\nHeller 1998, Sider 2002, Wang 2015, Woodward 2017; also Lewis 1986e,\n237f. and 259f.) Many philosophers who reject modal realism have come\nto appreciate counterpart theory because of its explanatory and\npuzzle-solving power. We will give a few examples.\n\nFirst, counterpart theory promises to explain the widespread\nelusiveness and context-dependence of essentialist judgements (Lewis\n1983d, 42\u20133; Lewis 1986e, \u00a74.5; cf. Kaplan 1979,\n100\u20132). Could London have been located in Scotland? Could it have\nbeen founded in the 16th century? The answers aren\u2019t obvious.\nFor Lewis, this is not because we have imperfect access to\nLondon\u2019s true essence, but simply because we have not settled\nexactly which other-worldly cities should qualify as counterparts of\nLondon. A London counterpart is a city that sufficiently\nresembles London, but the relevant resemblance criteria are\noften vague and context-dependent.\n\nSecond, counterpart theory might offer an answer to certain puzzles\nabout identity. Is a statue identical to the piece of clay from which\nit is formed? Is a person identical to their body? Lewis says yes.\nHowever, intuitively persons and bodies, or statues and pieces of\nclay, seem to differ in their modal properties: the piece of clay\ncould survive squashing, the statue could not. According to Lewis, the\nexplanation is that when we refer to an object as a statue, we give\nmore weight to similarity with respect to shape than when we think of\nthe same object as a piece of clay (see Lewis 1971; Lewis 1986e,\n252ff.; Lewis 2003, 27\u20138; and Robinson 1982).\n\nIn this context, Lewis suggests that different ways of referring to an\nobject can \u201cevoke\u201d different similarity standards, and\nthereby different counterpart relations, even within a single context\n(cf. Lewis 1986e, 258ff; Lewis 2003). This idea also helps to\nmake sense of conditionals like \u2019If I were you, I\u2019d hate\nme\u2019, where \u2018I\u2019 and \u2018me\u2019 in the\nconsequent intuitively pick out different individuals in the imagined\nperson-swapping scenario, both of which somehow represent the speaker\n(see Lewis 1973b, 43; Kocurek 2018).\n\nThird, counterpart theory might offer an answer to puzzles involving\npossible fission or time-travel. These might be analysed as scenarios\nin which an individual has multiple counterparts relative to the same\ncounterpart relation. Lewis intuits that he \u201cmight have been\ntwins\u201d (Lewis 1973, 40\u20131), because the fetus from which he\ndeveloped might have undergone fission. (See also Schwarz 2014, Karmo\n1983.)\n\nFourth, counterpart theory offers a way to accept haecceitistic\nintuitions without subscribing to haecceitism. Lewis assumes that all\ntruths supervene on qualitative truths: no two worlds agree in all\nqualitative respects, while disagreeing with respect to who plays\nwhich roles. A world of two-way eternal recurrence might look like a\ncounterexample: intuitively, we could have lived in any of the epochs\nof such a world; these seem to be distinct possibilities, but they do\nnot correspond to any qualitative difference. Lewis suggests that the\ndifferent epochs really do represent different possibilities for us,\nbecause we have counterparts in each of them. Here, too, Lewis invokes\nmultiple counterparthood relative to the same counterpart relation.\n(See Lewis 1986e, 230\u20135.)\n\nFifth, the fact that the counterpart relation need not be an\nequivalence relation has also been used to diffuse certain puzzles.\nConsider an ordinary bicycle. Intuitively, such an object does not\nhave all its parts essentially: the bike could have had a different\nchain, for instance. On the other hand, arguably it could not have\nbeen composed of entirely different parts. A bike made of\nentirely different parts would have been a different bike. But this\ncreates a puzzle (see Chisholm 1967, Chandler 1976): if the bike had a\ndifferent chain, it would still be an ordinary bike that does not have\nall its parts essentially; it could have had a different saddle (say).\nIterating this line of thought, we can create a sequence that leads\nfrom the actual bike to a bike composed of entirely different parts.\nEach possible bike in the sequence could have been the next bike in\nthe sequence. But didn\u2019t we say that it is impossible that my\nbike is composed of entirely different parts? Counterpart theory\noffers a natural answer: a counterpart of a counterpart need not be a\ncounterpart (see Lewis 1968, 28f; Lewis 1986e, 243\u20136;\nRamachandran 2020).\nSo far, we have focused on metaphysical modality. The central idea\nof counterpart theory has also been applied to other intensional\nconstructions.\nFor example, Sider (1996, 2001) and Hawley (2001) argue for a\ntemporal application, on which \u2018Joe Biden won the election\u2019 is\nanalysed as saying that a past counterpart of Biden won the\nelection. The temporal counterpart relation is here assumed to relate\nshort-lived temporal \u201cstages\u201d (see Schwarz 2014 for an alternative),\nand is not a matter of qualitative similarity. As in the modal case,\nthis approach has been advertised as solving a range of puzzles, as\nwell as explaining the vagueness and context-dependence of temporal\njudgements. Williams (2008) considers adopting the same perspective on\nidentity across space.\nSeveral authors (including Lewis) have suggested applying\ncounterpart theory to epistemic modality. Consider the following\npuzzle from Ninan (2018). A lottery has only two tickets, one blue and\none red. The tickets are numbered 1 and 2, but we don\u2019t know\nwhich color goes with which number. We know that the blue ticket won,\nbut we don\u2019t know the number of the winning ticket.  So, ticket\n1 might be the winner, and likewise for ticket 2. Yet even though\none of them is the red ticket it doesn\u2019t seem to follow that the\nred ticket is such that it might be the winner. Ninan suggests that\ndiffering counterpart relations are evoked by different ways of\npicking out the tickets. (See also Lewis 1983e, Stalnaker 1986, Shaw\n2015, Rabern 2018, among others.)\nAn alternative to counterpart theory is to interpret terms for\nordinary individuals as denoting (partial) functions from worlds to\nindividuals, or aggregates of individuals at different worlds; a modal\npredication like \u2018Biden might have been three-armed\u2019 is then\ninterpreted as saying that the function assigned to \u2018Biden\u2019 has a\nthree-armed value for some world, or that the aggregate assigned to\n \u2018Biden\u2019 has a three-armed part located in some world. A temporal\nanalogue of this view (with aggregates) is Lewis\u2019s preferred account\nof temporal discourse. In Lewis (1986f, 244) he endorses a similar\nview for events\u2014but see Bernstein (2014), Kaiserman (2017), and\nMcDonnell (2016) for reasons to prefer a counterpart-theoretic\ntreatment.[9]\n\nThe counterpart-theoretic analysis is more flexible insofar as it\neasily allows for cases of multiple counterparts or asymmetric\ncounterparthood, which are difficult to model with trans-world\naggregates. Lewis argues that this added flexibility is more important\nin the modal case than in the temporal case (Lewis 1971, 209; Lewis\n1983d, 40\u20132; Lewis 1986e, 217\u201320).\n8.2 Reactions and criticisms\n\nSome early criticisms of counterpart theory seem to rest on\nmisunderstandings. For example, Plantinga (1974, 115f.) and Salmon\n(1981, 232\u201338) complain that according to Lewis, all things have all\ntheir properties essentially, since there is no world in which these\nvery things exist and have different properties. Kripke (1980)\nsimilarly complains that according to Lewis, when we say that Humphrey\nmight have won the election, we are \u201cnot talking about something\nthat might have happened to Humphrey, but to someone\nelse\u201d (45, fn. 13). In response, Lewis points out that\non his view it is indeed Humphrey himself who might have won, in\nvirtue of having a winning counterpart, cf. Lewis (1986e, 194\u20136,\n246; 1983d, 41\u20132). Properly understood, Lewis\u2019s analysis\ndoes not even deny that there are worlds at which Humphrey (himself)\nwon the election. What the analysis denies is only that there are\nother worlds that contain Humphrey himself as a (winning) part. (See\nalso Hazen 1979, 320\u20134.)\n\nOne possible limitation of Lewis\u2019s account is that his\ncounterpart relation is assumed to be a qualitative similarity\nrelation. Feldman (1971) points out that \u201cI could have been\nquite unlike what I in fact am\u201d is intuitively true, which seems\nto require having non-similar counterparts. Lewis responds that there\nare two similarity relations involved: at the relevant worlds, there\nis someone who is similar to me in some respect (perhaps with respect\nto origin), but dissimilar from me in other respects (see Lewis\n1983d, 43; Lewis 1986e, 230\u2013235). Heller (2005), Stalnaker\n(1986), and Fara (2009) offer further considerations against analysing\ncounterparthood in terms of qualitative similarity.\n\nAnother limitation of Lewis\u2019s original presentation is that it\ndoes not allow imposing constraints on the choice of counterparts for\ndifferent individuals. Suppose we hold that Elizabeth II is\nessentially the daughter of George VI, and suppose there are worlds at\nwhich both Elizabeth and George have multiple counterparts, perhaps in\ndifferent epochs of eternally recurring time. Some Elizabeth\ncounterpart will then not be the daughter of some George counterpart.\nBy Lewis\u2019s 1968 account, \u2018Elizabeth might not have been\nGeorge\u2019s daughter\u2019 then comes out true, contrary to our\nsupposition. This problem was raised in Hazen (1979). Hazen suggests a\nrevised analysis in terms of sets of counterpart functions. Lewis\n(1983d, 44\u20135) instead suggests that we should understand\n\u2018Elizabeth might not have been George\u2019s daughter\u2019 as\na de re claim about the pair (or fusion) of Elizabeth and George.\nHazen (2012) argues that neither proposal fully avoids the\nproblem.\n\nThe most common objection to counterpart theory is probably that it\ngives rise to a deviant and counter-intuitive modal logic. Lewis\n(1968) gives translation rules from the language of quantified modal\nlogic to an extensional first-order language. These translation rules\ninvalidate the \u201cnecessity of identity\u201d and the\n\u201cnecessity of distinctness\u201d, as well as familiar\nprinciples of modal logic such \u25a1(A \u2227 B) \u2192 \u25a1A.\nConversely, they do validate controversial principles such as the\nConverse Barcan Formula and the \u201cnecessity of existence\u201d.\nIt has also been argued that the rules can\u2019t be extended to a\nlanguage with a well-behaved \u2018actually\u2019 operator.\n\nWhether these are genuine problems is a matter of debate. In fact,\nauthors in mathematical logic have come to appreciate\ncounterpart-theoretic interpretations of modal logic as overcoming\ncertain problems of standard Kripke semantics. There are also ways of\nreformulating Lewis\u2019s translation rules so as to avoid the\nsupposedly problematic features. See the supplementary document:\n\nCounterpart-theoretic Semantics for Quantified Modal Logic\n\n\nfor further details.\n\nLewis himself had no interest in preserving traditional principles of\nmodal logic. He always remained skeptical about the prospects of\nformalising modal discourse with boxes and diamonds. (see\ne.g. Lewis 1983d, 45; Lewis 1986e, 12\u201313). He thus rejected\nthe presupposition in these objections, that \u201cthe language of\nboxes and diamonds affords a good regimentation of ordinary modal\nthought\u201d (Lewis 1986e, 12).\n",
