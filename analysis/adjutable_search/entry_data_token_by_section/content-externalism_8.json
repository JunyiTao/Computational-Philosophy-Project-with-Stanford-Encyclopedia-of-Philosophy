    "main_text": "Extended Mind || State-Oriented Extended Mind\n5.1 State-Oriented Extended Mind\n\nClark and Chalmers (1998) provide a canonical argument for\nstate-oriented extended mind. Otto is in the early stages of\nAlzheimer\u2019s, and to facilitate his engagement with the world he\nwrites down what he suspects will be useful information in a notebook.\nReading in a newspaper that there is a particular exhibition going on\nat the Museum of Modern Art, Otto looks in his notebook, and\nfinds the sentence, \u201cThe Museum of Modern Art is on\n53rd Street\u201d, and, desiring to see the exhibition,\nduly sets off to 53rd Street. Clark and Chalmers argue, or\nare commonly taken to argue, that the sentence should be regarded as\none of Otto\u2019s beliefs. Their argument is predicated on a\nfunctionalist conception of beliefs as individuated by their\nfunctional roles. The sentence plays a functional role in Otto\u2019s\npsychological economy that is, if not precisely identical, similar\nenough to the functional role of a belief in the psychology of an\nunimpaired subject for the sentence to qualify as a belief. If this is\ncorrect, it means that at least one of Otto\u2019s beliefs lies in\nthe notebook rather than in his head. As usually understood, this view\nqualifies as a form of state-oriented extended mind to the\nextent that it identifies a mental state (a belief) with an external\nstructure (a sentence).\n",
