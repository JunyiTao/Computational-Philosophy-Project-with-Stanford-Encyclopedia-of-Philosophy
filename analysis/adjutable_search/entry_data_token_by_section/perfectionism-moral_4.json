    "main_text": "Perfectionist Ethics || Consequentialism and Deontology\n2.1 Consequentialism and Deontology\n\n\nThe best life for a human being might be one that simultaneously\nbest perfects himself and best perfects others. But this\npossibility is unlikely. Even if the conflict between one\u2019s\nown good and the good of others is not as sharp as it is often taken to\nbe, there will, in all likelihood, be circumstances in which human\nbeings must choose between their own perfection and the perfection of\nothers.\n\n\nHow then should this conflict be adjudicated within perfectionist\nethics? Egoistic forms of perfectionism have a ready answer to this\nquestion.  One should promote the perfection of others only to the\nextent that the perfection of others furthers one\u2019s own\nperfection. Non-egoistic forms, by contrast, must find a way to\nbalance the conflicting demands. One natural response to this problem\nis straightforwardly consequentialist. Perfectionism, it can be said,\nrequires that we pursue the greatest development of all human beings\nat all times (Hurka 1993, 55\u201360). So understood, perfectionism\ngives each human being a shared comprehensive goal.  This makes\nperfectionism a very demanding moral theory. It is demanding in two\nrespects. First, it demands, other things being the same, that we\nweigh the perfection of others equally with our own\nperfection. Second, it demands that, to the extent left open by the\nfirst demand, that we maximize our own perfection.\n\n\nPerhaps this kind of consequentialist perfectionism asks too much of\nus. We can imagine forms of perfectionism that relax both of its\ndemands.\n\n\nConsider, for example, a perfectionist moral theory that includes an\nagent-centered prerogative. Such a theory could allow that\npersons can favor their own perfection, to some reasonable degree, over\nthe perfection of others and that persons need only pursue their own\nperfection up to some threshold level. This relaxed perfectionism\nwould depart from the main historical defenses of perfectionism (which\nemphasize maximization) and it would not well fit the term\nperfectionism (which connotes maximization). But the important\nquestion is whether a view of this type is nonetheless plausible.\n\n\nThe answer depends, in part, on whether human nature or objective\ngoods perfectionism is the favored view. If perfection is\nunderstood in terms of the development of human nature, then a view\nthat departs from the maximizing injunction will look less\npromising. A person who has extraordinary potential for\nexcellence, but who only achieves a threshold level of development does\nnot plausibly achieve perfection. Since she was capable of so\nmuch more, we should not be content with her modest achievements.\nIntuitively, we should judge that she has not fully lived up to the\nrequirements of perfectionist morality (Hurka 1993, 56).\nMoreover, on this version of perfectionism, an agent\u2019s\nprimary moral goal is to develop human nature, not to lead a rewarding\nor fulfilling life. But if the development of human nature is the\ngoal, then it is a bit of a mystery why each human being\u2019s own\ndevelopment should have special value for himself (Hurka 1993,\n62\u201363).\n\n\nMatters look different if perfection is understood in terms of the\nrealization of objective goods. For, on this version of\nperfectionism, it is plausible to hold that each human being has an\nagent-relative interest in leading a successful life, where success is\nunderstood in terms of the pursuit of valuable goals and the\nrealization of perfectionist goods. A successful life, so\nunderstood, plausibly requires only a threshold realization of certain\nperfectionist goods, such as friendship, knowledge, and aesthetic\nexperience. For these reasons, a non-maximizing injunction fits\nbetter with objective goods perfectionism than with human nature\nperfectionism.\n\n\nWhatever its merits, the introduction of an agent-centered\nprerogative into perfectionist morality would exacerbate a problem with\nstandard consequentialist versions of perfectionism. It would\nappear to give human beings a moral liberty to harm others if doing so\nwould promote their own\n perfection.[4]\nTrue, the problem is present even without the\nintroduction of the agent-centered prerogative. A pure\nconsequentialist perfectionism in principle could enjoin the sacrifice\nof those who had little potential for perfectionist achievement for\nthose who had great potential. But such a view would at least\nhave the virtue that those who were sacrificed would be contributing to\nthe goal of maximum perfectionist achievement\u2014a goal they\nshould share if they are consequentialist perfectionists. The\nsame is not guaranteed to hold true if the prerogative is\nintroduced.\n\n\nSince the worry here is one that confronts consequentialist accounts\nof morality in general, it might be thought that perfectionist morality\nshould take a deontological structure instead. Deontological\nperfectionism would hold that the goal of promoting human perfection is\nconstrained by the requirement to respect the perfection, or the\ncapacity to achieve it, in each human being. The structure of\nsuch a view can be glimpsed by considering the objective goods version\nof perfectionism. For it is plausible that the achievement of\ncertain objective goods, such as friendship or community with others,\nrequires that we treat others with respect. Requirements of\nrespect, it can be said, are constitutively necessary conditions for\nthe realization of many perfectionist goods.\n\n\nThis is not the place to explore the structure of such a view in\ndetail. Nor is it the place to discuss the extent to which it\nrepresents a genuine departure from consequentialism (Pettit and Smith\n2004). Instead, another possible response to the worry can\nbe mentioned. As Rawls pointed out, perfectionism is often taken\nto be merely one element of a general moral theory (Rawls 1971,\n325). The moral duty to maximize human perfection must be balanced\nagainst other moral principles. Deontological constraints and\nagent-centered prerogatives might limit the duty to promote human\nperfection, but they might do so because they are derived from\nindependent moral principles. On this mixed view, in which\nperfectionism is understood as merely one element of a general moral\ntheory, it is possible to recommend perfectionism as an agent-neutral\nmaximizing doctrine and avoid the unwanted implications that morality\nis excessively demanding and that it endorses the sacrifice of some for\nthe sake of greater overall human perfection.\n",
