Philosophical Themes in the Law of Contracts\n\nThe second part of this entry explores questions in the philosophy of\nlanguage (on meaning and interpretation), philosophy of action (the\nmetaphysics of intention), and moral and political philosophy (freedom\nand distributive justice) as they arise in contract law.\n \u00a72.1\n discusses work that brings tools from the philosophy of language to\nbear on questions of contract interpretation.\n \u00a72.2\n examines the concept of freedom in contract through the lens of\nestablished doctrine and philosophical work on autonomy.\n \u00a72.3\n explores how the pairing of orthodox contract theory with modern\ndoctrine generates a puzzle about the nature of contractual intent.\nFinally,\n \u00a72.4\n considers questions of distributive justice raised by private\nexchange.\n",
