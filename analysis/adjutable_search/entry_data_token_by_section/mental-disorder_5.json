    "main_text": "The Mental in Mental Disorder || Metaphysical Implications\n3.3 Metaphysical Implications\n\nMental disorders are conditions or states attributed to persons, but\nthis need entail neither that they are entirely non-physical in\nnature, nor that they must (or even can), be explained in solely\nneuro-scientific terms. Maintaining the separation between mental and\nphysical disorders is compatible with some forms of weak physicalism,\nallowing that mental or psychological processing involved in functions\nsuch as perception, reasoning and memory, are realized in the workings\nof the brain (see Schaffner 2016; Jefferson 2021 and the\n entry on health).\n Problems of both supervenience and emergence theories have been seen\nto argue towards the holistic \u201cnaturalistic dualism\u201d\nentailed in a biopsychosocial model (Bolton & Gillett 2019;\nO\u2019Leary 2021).\n",
