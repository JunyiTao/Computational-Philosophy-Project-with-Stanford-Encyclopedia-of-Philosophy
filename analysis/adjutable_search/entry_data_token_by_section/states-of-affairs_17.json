    "main_text": "The Unity of a State of Affairs || Internal Unification\n7. Conclusion\n\nDoes one need states of affairs in addition to facts and thoughts?\nYes, there seem to be good reasons to posit states of affairs as a\nsui generis category of object. If states of affairs are to\nbe useful (i) they must exist even if they do not obtain and (ii) must\ninvolve objects and properties (relations) directly. (i) is the basic\nfeature that distinguishes states of affairs from facts; (ii) the\nbasic feature that distinguishes them from thoughts. Therefore a\ntheory of states of affairs must answer the question how a state of\naffairs can \u201cinvolve\u201d objects and properties (relations)\nand combine them, if the objects don\u2019t exemplify the properties\n(stand in the relations). Although there are promising proposals to\nanswer it, this question is still open.\nAppendix: Some Historical Background\n\nSmith (1992: 1103\u20134) traces state affairs like entities back to\nAristotle and medieval philosophers. Important contributions to the\ntheory of states of affairs were made in particular in Austro-German\nPhilosophy. Stumpf (1907: 29\u201330) claimed that the notion of\nstates of affairs was introduced in Franz Brentano\u2019s lectures on\nlogic (1870\u20131885). Brentano distinguished between a mental act,\nits content and its object. When I think of Hesperus, my thinking, the\nact, has a particular content in virtue of which it\nis directed on the planet, the object. In his logic lectures\nBrentano extended this distinction to judgements (Brentano\n1870ff:13.020 [6]): when I judge that Hesperus is a planet, my judging\nhas a content and an object: the object is what is judged (\u201cdas\nGeurteilte\u201d). Stumpf (1907: 30) called the content of a\njudgement \u201cSachverhalt\u201d. This term is now translated as\n\u201cstate of affairs\u201d.\u00a0 However, Stumpf\u2019s states\nof affairs are rather close to thoughts or propositions (see also\nSmith 1992, 1105). For example, Stumpf (1907: 30) likened states of\naffairs to Bolzano\u2019s sentences-in-themselves. Sentences-in\nthemselves are supposed to be either true or false. This suggests that\nstates of affairs were also conceived as truth-value bearers by\nStumpf.\n\nAccording to Adolf Reinach (1911: 374, Fn.),\u00a0 Edmund Husserl, a\nstudent of Brentano, was the first to clarify the significance and\ndistinctive nature of states of affairs. Husserl (1901: V \u00a717,\n\u00a7 18) took the object and not the content of a judgement to be a\nstate of affairs. Every judgement has a content, in Husserl\nterminology \u201cmatter\u201d (Materie) in virtue of which\nit is directed on a state of affairs, its object. Different kinds of\nmental act can be directed on the same state of affairs.\u00a0 For\ninstance, when I wonder whether Rome was built in a day and when I\njudge that Rome was built in a day, I am directed on the same state of\naffairs, but once in the questioning, once in the assertoric mode. Can\njudgements that differ in their matter be directed on the same state\nof affairs? An answer to this question would help us to fix the\ndistinction between matter and content for judgements. But\nHusserl\u2019s answer to this question is difficult to reconstruct.\nHusserl 1900 connected states of affairs further to correct judgement,\nprobability and the laws of logic. For instance, a judgement is\nsupposed to be correct if, and only if, the state of affairs it is\ndirected on obtains (Husserl 1900: 13).\n\nReinach 1911 followed Husserl: states of affairs are the\n\u201ccorrelates\u201d of judgement and assertion (See Meinertsen\n2020 for a comparison between Reinach and Armstrongian states of\naffairs). If, for instance, a particular rose exists, a range of\nstates of affairs exists that depend on the rose, whether they obtain\nor not (see Reinach 1911: 340). If I judge that the rose is blue, I\njudge incorrectly, because the judged state of affairs exists, but\ndoes not obtain. The property of states of affairs to obtain or fail\nto obtain distinguishes them from facts. As we have seen in section 2,\nthe \u201cspace\u201d of states of affairs helps Reinach to clarify\nthe notions of modality and probability (see Reinach 1911:\n339\u201340).\u00a0 Reinach (1911: 338f) proposed, but did not argue\nin detail, that states of affairs are the relata of the\nground-consequence relation. If an event a causes an event\nb, the state of affairs that a occurs is the ground\nof the state of affairs that b occurs. States of affairs\nfigure prominently in Wittgenstein\u2019s Tractatus\nLogico-Philosophicus. Potter (2011, 106) speculates about the\ninfluence of Austrian philosophers on Wittgenstein in this\nrespect.\n",
