    "main_text": "The Private Language Argument Expounded || The Central Argument Continued\n3.4 The Central Argument Continued\n\nNow that we are clearer about what the connection is which has to be\nremembered right, we can return to the exposition of the argument. I\nam to imagine that I am a private linguist. I have a sensation, and\nmake the mark \u2018S\u2019 at the same time, as I might in\nan ordinary case introduce a sign by ostensive definition. Afterwards,\nI \u201cbelieve\u201d myself to have established a meaning for this\nsign \u2018S\u2019, and I now use it to judge that I am\nagain experiencing the same sensation. What do I mean by\n\u2018S\u2019 on this second occasion? Wittgenstein\nconsiders two possible answers.\nThe First Answer\n\nOne of the answers is that what I mean by \u2018S\u2019 is\njust the sort of sensation I am now having. Of this Wittgenstein says\nmerely:\n\n\u2026 whatever is going to seem correct to me is correct. And that\nonly means that here we can\u2019t talk about \u2018correct\u2019.\n\n\nThe point is highly condensed. Here is a more explicit version. For\nthere to be factual assertion, there must be the distinction between\ntruth and falsehood, between saying what is the case and saying what\nis not. For there to be the distinction between truth and falsehood,\nthere must be a further distinction between the source of the meaning,\nand the source of the truth, of what is said. Suppose that I confront\nsome object and say of it \u2018This is S\u2019. If I must\nalso appeal to this very object to make this utterance intelligible to\nmyself, I deprive it of any claim to the status of factual\nassertion\u2014it becomes, at best, ostensive definition. (The\n\u2018at best\u2019 is important here, for the same reason that the\ndiary example is not to be assumed genuinely possible.)\nThe Second Answer\n\nThe second answer Wittgenstein considers to the question of what I\nmean by \u2018S\u2019 is this: I mean by\n\u2018S\u2019, not this current sensation, but the\nsensation I named \u2018S\u2019 in the past. We have\nalready seen, in Kenny\u2019s rejection of the Orthodox reading of the\nargument, that scepticism about memory has no place in the discussion\nof \u201cprivate language\u201d; the text simply does not support\nit. But at this point we must break with Kenny too. For according to\nhis account the crucial claim becomes: \u2018If it is possible for me\nto misremember my previous ostensive definition of\n\u201cS\u201d, then I do not really know what\n\u201cS\u201d means.\u2019 (See, e.g., Kenny [1973] p.\n194.) This is just conventional scepticism about memory extended to\ninclude meanings as well as judgments. And it is an elementary point\nof epistemology that knowing something does not obviously entail just\nas a result of the definition of knowledge that it is\nimpossible for one to be wrong about that thing, only that\none is not in fact wrong.\n\nWhat has gone wrong? The answer is that Kenny\u2019s and the Orthodox\naccounts share an unnoticed assumption: that even in the circumstances\nof the \u201cprivate language\u201d there is actually an application\nof a sign to a private sensation by a private linguist. The problem as\nKenny then conceives it is one of later remembering this earlier\napplication in order that \u2018S\u2019 should have\nretained its meaning. The question then seems to be whether one\u2019s\nadmittedly fallible memory is adequate for the maintenance of meaning.\nBut why should this assumption be allowed? What entitles us to assume\nthat a private linguist could even ostensively define his sign to\nhimself in the first place? As we have seen, this is one of the\nmatters in question; and \u00a7\u00a7260 and 261 show that\nWittgenstein was not prepared to let an argument in favour of private\nlanguage proceed from this assumption. In these two sections\nWittgenstein reminds us that his arguments in the earlier sections\n(e.g., 33\u201335) of Philosophical Investigations showed\nthat ostensive definition was not achieved by any performance unless\ncertain circumstantial conditions are fulfilled; and nothing about the\ndiary case as so far described shows them to be fulfilled. It is only\nlater (\u00a7\u00a7270\u2013271) that Wittgenstein imagines a partial\nfulfilment of them, and the result there is to render the language\npublic.\n\nOne cause of the muddle is Wittgenstein\u2019s insistence that there must\nbe a distinction between obeying a rule and merely thinking that one\nhas. This does not result, as the Orthodox have supposed, in a demand\nfor, and eventual rejection of, \u2018memory-infallibility in a\nprivate language\u2019: demand and rejection being based respectively\non the grounds that without infallibility one could always be going\nwrong and would never know if one were, and with infallibility one\nwould collapse the distinction between obeying a rule and merely\nthinking one was obeying it. Rather, the argument is this. The private\nlinguist cannot legislate a meaning for a sign by \u201cprivate\nostensive definition\u201d merely\u2014for this has to\nestablish a technique of using the sign (\u00a7260). The technique\ncannot function by means of repeated \u201costensive\ndefinitions\u201d, as we saw in examining the first answer, since\nthis collapses the distinction between meaning and truth and thus\ndestroys the possibility of making factual judgments. So the so-called\n\u201cdefinition\u201d has on some other basis to establish a\nconstancy in use of the sign.\n\nBut this is just what is in question. What would be constancy\nhere? What would be using the sign in the same way as before?\nHow was the sign used in the first place? As there cannot be\nassumed to be a way of using the sign which the linguist succeeds even\nin determining, let alone establishing, and which is the correct way,\nindependent of the linguist\u2019s later impression of the correct way,\nthen a defender of \u201cprivate language\u201d would have to show\nthat there was. It might now seem as if one could show this by\nappealing to the private linguist\u2019s memory. He simply remembers how he\nused the sign before. And this looks straightforward enough, because\none thinks: he certainly did something before, for he remembers it.\nAnd we do not require his memory to be infallible. But the memory does\nat least have to be a memory: that is, accurate or not, it\nhas to be of something determinate which existed independently of the\nmemory of it; and the \u201cmemory\u201d alone cannot bring such a\nthing into existence.\n\nThis is the argument of \u00a7265, which has often been mistakenly\ngiven an epistemological interpretation. Again we cannot assume that\nthere has been an actual table (even a mental one) of meanings in the\ncase of the private linguist, a table which is now recalled and about\nwhich the linguist must rely on recall since the original has gone.\nRather, as \u00a7\u00a7260\u2013264 show, there may be nothing\ndeterminate other than this \u201cremembering of the table\u201d. So\nwhen we think that a private linguist could remember the meaning of\n\u2018S\u2019 by remembering a past correlation of the sign\n\u2018S\u2019 with a sensation, we are supposing what needs\nto be itself established\u2014that there was indeed some independent\ncorrelation to be remembered. Fallibility of memory, even of memory of\nmeaning, is neither here nor there: the point is not that there is\ndoubt now about the trustworthiness of memory, but that there\nwas doubt then about the status of what occurred. And this\noriginal, non-epistemological, doubt cannot later be removed\nby \u201crecollections\u201d of a status inherently dubious in the\nfirst place. That is, if there was no genuine original correlation in\nthe first place, a \u201cmemory\u201d will not create one. But if,\nalternatively, we do not suppose that there was something independent\nof the memory to be remembered, again \u2018what seems right is\nright\u2019; the \u201cmemory\u201d of the\n\u201ccorrelation\u201d is being employed to confirm itself, for\nthere is no independent access to the \u201cremembered\ncorrelation\u201d. (Not even the independent access that we have as\nposers of the example, since the question is, can we pose such an\nexample? The typical mistake commentators make here is to disguise the\nproblem by thinking of S in terms of some already established\nconcept, such as  pain, which they bring to the example\nthemselves.) This is why Wittgenstein says in \u00a7265, \u2018As if\nsomeone were to buy several copies of today\u2019s morning paper to assure\nhimself that what it said was true\u2019.\nThe Closing Stages\n\nSo far the argument has been conducted in terms of an \u2018I\u2019\nnot essentially related to body or related only to an inert body. At\n\u00a7269, however, it moves to examples where there is bodily\nbehaviour but despite this there is still the temptation to think of\nprivate meanings for words independent of their public use. This\nsuggests a further chance for a defender of the idea of a private\nlanguage: that a private linguist might secure a meaning for his sign\n\u2018S\u2019 by correlating its private use with some\npublic phenomenon. This would apparently serve to provide a function\nfor the noting of \u2018S\u2019 in the diary (\u00a7260)\nand thus give a place for ostensive definition, and would give as well\na guarantee that there is some constancy in the linguist\u2019s use of the\nterm \u2018S\u2019 independent of his impression of such\nconstancy. Wittgenstein uses the example of the manometer in\n\u00a7\u00a7270\u2013271 to consider this idea, and his criticism of\nit is in effect that this method of securing meaning works, but that\nthe secured meaning is public: the so-called \u201cprivate\nobject\u201d, even if there were such a thing, is revealed to be\nirrelevant to meaning. Presumably a defender of \u201cprivate\nlanguage\u201d would hope that the example would work like this: if I\nkeep saying, on the basis of my sensation, that my blood pressure is\nrising, and the manometer shows that I am right, then this success in\njudging my own blood pressure shows that I had in fact established a\nprivate meaning for the sign \u2018S\u2019 and was using\nthe sign in the same way each time to judge that my sensation was the\nsame each time. However, all the example really shows is that just\nthinking that I have the same sensation now as I had when my blood\npressure rose formerly, can be a good guide to the rising of my blood\npressure. Whether in some \u201cprivate sense\u201d the sensation\nwas \u201cactually the same\u201d or not becomes completely\nirrelevant to the question of constancy in the use of\n\u2018S\u2019\u2014that is, there is no gap between the\nactual nature of the sensation and my impression of it, and\n\u2018S\u2019 in this case could mean merely\n\u2018sensation of the rising of the blood pressure\u2019; indeed,\nfor all we are told of the sign\u2019s role, it could even mean just\n\u2018blood pressure rising\u2019.\n",
