    "main_text": "The Ars || The structure of the Ars\n5.1 The structure of the Ars\n\nThe Ars is structured to answer questions, which are\ninvariably found in the final sections of the different versions of\nthe Ars. These answers are usually a combination of terms\nconstituted by using the elements that form the Ars: terms,\nfigures, and alphabet.\n\nThe terms are the basic concepts of the Ars. For example, the\nDignities, such as Goodness, Beauty, Greatness, Eternity; or the\nprinciples, such as Difference, Concordance, Contrariety, etc.\n\nThe figures are graphical forms of different types, such as circles,\ntables, and triangles, which form the combinations of both the\ninternal elements and their combinations with other figures.\n\nFinally, the alphabet is used, above all, in the Ternary Period, and\nit is formed by nine letters whose meaning is not fixed, as it is\nunderstood according to the use of the figures and their\ncombinations.\n",
