A strong rationale for\nengaging in administrative purges is to signal that a political\ntransition is real and that the authoritarian past is being put to\nrest. Officials responsible for a transition want to signal that the\nemerging democratic polity will operate differently from its corrupt\nand dangerous predecessor. Such signaling is achieved, inter\nalia, by displacing those who were responsible for administering\nthe corrupt and vicious policies of the past. And surely, public trust\ndoes depend on communicating to ordinary citizens that a fresh\npolitical start has been made\u2014that a new and lawful polity has\nbeen launched. On the other hand, public trust also depends on the\nfunctionality and competence of government. The trains need to run,\nlicenses need to be issued or renewed, roads need to be maintained,\nand public order has to be kept. And if the bureaucratic class that\nknows how to do these things is subtracted from post war politics\nbecause of how it behaved under the previous regime, the daily\noperation of government is likely to suffer. And public trust is\nlikely to tumble accordingly (this is when we begin to hear that\n\u201cat least under Saddam the trains ran on time\u201d, etc.) The\nfirst dilemma of lustration,then, concerns its scope: how does one\nlustrate enough so that public trust (and retributive justice) are\nserved, without lustrating so much that the organs of government are\nundone and public trust is lost as a\n result?[35]\n\n\n\nIt goes without saying that different countries face different\npolitical circumstances when it comes to how much lustration they can\ncarry out: East Germany could afford to purge its civil service rather\nseverely, due to the availability of replacements from the West. Other\nnations, such as Poland and Czechoslovakia, did not have this luxury\nand had often to prioritize stability due to the exigencies and\ninherent dangers of the initial transition period.\nAnother complication impacting the scope of lustration arises from\nthe difficulty in fixing degrees of guilt under totalitarian regimes.\nHere the problem is not so much lustrating in a way that maintains\npublic trust but, rather, figuring out what counts, philosophically,\nas the appropriate degree of guilt to justify lustration in the first\nplace. Mid-level officials in a ruling party mechanism cannot be\nautomatically labeled as enthusiastic or even willing supporters of\nthe machinery of oppression. Some were, some passively found their way\ninto their roles and still others were coerced into them. A morally\nlegitimate policy of lustration must take into account such gradations\nof\n guilt.[36]\n\nBut the ability to determine degrees of culpability requires\nexpensive, lengthy investigations which are often beyond the means of\nthose orchestrating a transition.\n\n\nBeyond these problems of scope lies an epistemological difficulty:\nLustration purges and exclusions frequently, though not always, rely\non testimonials and security service files which are often of dubious\naccuracy. The files are often rife with human error, exaggerations,\nand omissions. The most valuable Communist informants and\ncollaborators were often missing from surviving secret police files\n(many were destroyed or \u201cdisappeared\u201d, probably into KGB\npossession) or were shielded during the process (Minow\n 2000).[37]\n On the other hand,\nemployees of the security services often embellished their accounts\nand added false informants in the period before an audit so that they\ncould meet or exceed their prescribed\n quota.[38]\n\n",
