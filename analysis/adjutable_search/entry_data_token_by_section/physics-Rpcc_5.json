    "main_text": "The Fork Asymmetry\n6. The Fork Asymmetry\n\nReichenbach\u2019s Direction of Time (1956) was centrally\nconcerned with temporally asymmetric phenomena. Much of the work is\ndevoted to the status of the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which says\nthat in a closed system, entropy can increase but will never decrease.\nBut Reichenbach also tried to define a macroscopic statistical\nasymmetry using the Common Cause Principle. Suppose that events\nA and B are correlated, i.e., that \\(p(A \\cap B) >\np(A)p(B)\\). If there is an event C that satisfies conditions\n (2)\u2013(5)\n above, Reichenbach called the trio ACB a conjunctive\nfork. If C occurs earlier than A and B, and\nthere is no event satisfying (2)\u2013(5) that occurs later than\nA and B, then ACB is said to form a conjunctive\nfork open to the future (see\n Figure 6(a)).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: (a) Conjunctive fork open to\nthe future. (b) Conjunctive fork open to the past. (c) Closed fork.\n[An\n extended description of figure 6\n is in the supplement.] \n\n\n Analogously, if there is a later event satisfying (2)\u2013(5), but\nno earlier event, we have a conjunctive fork open to the past\n (Figure 6(b)).\n If an earlier event C and a later event D both satisfy\n(2)\u2013(5), then ACBD forms a closed fork\n (Figure 6(c)).\n Reichenbach claimed that in our world, there are a great many forks\nopen to the future, but few or none open to the past. Moreover, he\nproposed that the direction from cause to effect could be grounded in\nthis statistical asymmetry.\n\nReichenbach saw his fork asymmetry as a macro-statistical analog of\nthe second law of thermodynamics. Suppose we have a system such as a\ngas that is made up of a large number of particles. Each particle can\nbe in one of many possible states \\(s_1,\\dots,s_n\\). Let \\(p_i\\) be\nproportion of the particles that are in state \\(s_i\\). Then one\nexpression for the entropy of the system is \\(S = {-}\\sum_i\np_i log(p_i)\\). This sum will reach a maximum when the particles are\nevenly distributed among the n states (or distributed as evenly\nas possible given constraints on the system). The second law of\nthermodynamics states that the entropy of a closed system can increase\nbut never decrease; hence it will evolve toward a state of maximum\nentropy. Reichenbach claims that if we find a closed system in a state\nof low entropy, we can infer that it was recently prepared in that\nstate, before being closed off from the rest of the environment.\n\nNow suppose that we have two events A and B, and a\nprobability distribution p over the four states \\(AB\\),\n\\(A\\overline{B}\\), \\(\\overline{A}B\\), \\(\\overline{A} \\overline{B}\\).\nWe can apply the formula for entropy to this probability distribution;\nholding the probability of A and B fixed, the entropy\nwill be highest when A and B are probabilistically\nindependent. Thus, when we find a correlation between A and\nB, this is like finding a system in a state of low entropy, and\nwe should look for some event in the past of A and B to\nexplain this correlation. This is only a formal analogy, but\nReichenbach attempted to show that the same basic principles that give\nrise to the second law of thermodynamics would also give rise to the\nCommon Cause Principle. For more discussion, see the entry on\n thermodynamic asymmetry in time.\n\nReichenbach\u2019s fork asymmetry has been subjected to numerous\ncriticisms. Horwich (1987) argues that our willingness to infer a past\ninteraction often has little to do with entropy. We may infer from a\npile of rubble that a city has been bombed. A pile of rubble\ncorresponds to higher entropy than intact buildings; but it is the\nformer, rather than the latter, that leads us to infer that a certain\nkind of interaction with the city has taken place.\n\n\n\nFigure 7:  \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) is the entire\nstate space. Three copies of \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) are shown, corresponding\nto times 0, t, and \\(t^\\prime > t\\). If the system is in state\ns at time 0, it will be in state \\(U_t(s)\\) at time t,\nand state \\(U_{t^\\prime}(s)\\) at time \\(t^\\prime\\). The set of states\ncorresponding to event C will evolve into \\(U_t(C)\\) and\n\\(U_{t^\\prime}(C)\\). [An\n extended description of figure 7\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nArntzenius (1990) points out that the fork asymmetry is highly\nproblematic in the context of classical statistical mechanics within\nwhich Reichenbach was working. Let \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) be a state-space\ncontaining all possible states of a physical system (see\n Figure 7).\n The state of a system s at a particular time t will\ninvolve the specification of parameters, such as the positions and\nmomenta of all the particles in the system. The system evolves\ndeterministically, so that for every time time t, if the system\nwas in state s at time 0, it will be in state \\(U_t(s)\\) at\ntime t, where each \\(U_t\\) is a one-one function from\n\\(\\mathcal{S}\\) into itself. An event such as C corresponds to\na subset of \\(\\mathcal{S}\\): the set of states in which C\noccurs. We can then define \\(U_t(C)\\) to be the set of states of the\nform \\(U_t(s)\\), where \\(s \\in C\\).\n\nA probability function p on \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) at time 0 can then\nbe extended to a probability distribution over trajectories through\n\\(\\mathcal{S}\\), yielding probabilities for events at later times.\n\nSuppose that C occurs at time 0, and A and B\noccur at later time t. Suppose, moreover, that ACB forms\na conjunctive fork. Then we can evolve the set of microstates in\nC forward to time \\(t^\\prime > t\\). Then \\(D =\nU_{t^\\prime}(C)\\) will occur after A and B, but stand in\nthe same probabilistic relationship to A and B that\nC does (see\n Figure 8).\n Thus ACBD will form a closed fork. Since this recipe is\nperfectly general, it seems that every conjunctive fork ACB\nwith C earlier than A and B must belong to a\nclosed fork ABCD.\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Event D at time\n\\(t^\\prime\\) results from evolving C forward from time 0 to\n\\(t^\\prime\\). It will stand in the same probabilistic relationship to\nevents A and B at time t that C did at\ntime 0. [An\n extended description of figure 8\n is in the supplement.] \n\n\nA natural response to this worry is to propose that the earlier set of\nstates C will be sufficiently coherent to form a natural event,\nwhile the later set of states D will be a heterogeneous\ncollection, having nothing in common except for the fact that they all\nevolved states in C. Such a heterogeneous collection of states\nwould not qualify as an event\u2014see, e.g., Lewis (1986)\nfor discussion of what qualifies as a genuine event. Hence, there is\nan earlier event that screens off A and B, but no later\nevent that does so. However, the framework of statistical mechanics\ngives us no principled reason for thinking that in all such cases, the\nearlier screening off event will be coherent enough to be a proper\nevent, while the later screener will not be. Moreover, Arntzenius\n(1990) offers a counterexample to one way of making this proposal\nprecise.\n\nWe will also see in Section 7 that the modern theory of causal\nmodeling does not use conjunctive forks to determine the direction of\ncausation, but rather uses a probabilistic pattern that is essentially\nthe exact opposite of a conjunctive fork.\n",
