    "main_text": "Evolutionary Metaethics || General Evolutionary Debunking Arguments\n4.1 General Evolutionary Debunking Arguments\n\nAs discussed in section 2, evolutionary accounts of the origins of our\ncapacity to be guided by moral judgments do not require any appeal to\nthe comprehension of moral truths by our hominin ancestors,\nor even to the existence of such truths. Such stories require only\nclaims about natural selection pressures having favored the\ndevelopment of such a capacity and tendency because of the positive\neffects such traits had on biological fitness (Kitcher 2006a, 176, and\n2011; Joyce 2006, 131, 184; Street 2006, 127 f.; Griffiths and Wilkins\n2015). Should this fact undermine our confidence in the existence of\nmoral truth or in the possibility of moral knowledge (at least if\nmoral truths are understood to be objective, i.e., independent of our\nevaluative attitudes)?\n\nProponents of epistemic \u2018evolutionary debunking arguments\u2019\nthink it should, arguing either that evolutionary considerations\nsupport moral skepticism (Joyce 2006, 2013, Forthcoming) or that they\nat least undermine traditional moral realism by providing a defeater\nfor our moral beliefs if correctness for moral beliefs is\nconstrued in a realist fashion as accurate representation of objective\nor independent moral truths (Street 2006, 2008). (For discussion of\nthese arguments, see Copp 2008, Kahane 2011, Enoch 2011, Skarsaune\n2011, Shafer-Landau 2012, Berker 2014, Fraser 2014, FitzPatrick\n2014a,b and 2017a,b, Vavova 2015, Rini 2016, Levi and Levi 2020, among\nmany others.)\n\nOn the face of it, the mere fact that natural selection would not have\n\u2018designed\u2019 our moral faculties to track moral truths\naccurately (as it plausibly designed our perceptual faculties to track\nfacts about medium sized objects in typical human environments) is not\nobviously problematic. There are, after all, lots of cases where we\nseem to be able to grasp genuine truths even though those truths play\nno role in the story of how our basic mental capacities evolved. We\nare able to grasp truths of quantum field theory or higher dimensional\ntopology or, for that matter, philosophy (or so we are assuming in\neven engaging in this debate) even though those truths had nothing to\ndo with why the basic mental capacities underlying these abilities\nevolved in our Pleistocene ancestors. Those capacities evolved in\nresponse to selection pressures in ancestral hunter-gatherer\nenvironments, and we have simply learned how to develop, train and\nexercise them in cultural contexts to discover truths that go far\nbeyond any that were relevant to the evolution of those underlying\ncapacities. Philosophers who endorse some form of moral realism have\ntypically believed that we\u2019ve done the same thing in grasping\nmoral truths (see sections 2.4\u20132.5).\n\nSuppose, however, that evolutionary influences not only did not design\nour faculties to track moral truths, but did positively shape\nthem in ways that have pervasively conditioned the content of\nour moral thought and feeling, through evolved emotional dispositions\nor \u201cdomain specific modules\u201d that provide us with\ninherited moral instincts that shape our beliefs. Debunkers have\nclaimed that this is the case and argued that it has deep metaethical\nimplications. Though there are a variety of formulations of such\narguments, with somewhat different targets (some attacking moral\nknowledge itself, others seeking only to undermine moral realism by\nshowing that it would saddle us with moral skepticism), a core\nargument based on the work of Sharon Street may be spelled out roughly\nlike this:\nEvolutionary Debunking Argument:\n\n\u201cOur system of evaluative judgments is thoroughly saturated with\nevolutionary influence,\u201d because of the role natural selection\nplayed in shaping our underlying psychological dispositions (Street\n2006, 114). But natural selection shaped those dispositions simply\naccording to which variations best contributed to the biological\nfitness of our hominin ancestors, rather than in ways that would be\nexpected to track independent moral truths as such, even if they\nexisted. That is, natural selection rewarded moral belief-forming\ndispositions that yielded whatever moral beliefs led to behaviors that\ncaused hunter-gatherers to out-reproduce their peers and propagate\ntheir genes more effectively, regardless of whether or not these\nbeliefs happened accurately to represent a realm of independent moral\ntruths. (The same would have been true for religious beliefs and\ntheological truths: all that mattered were the relevant effects on\ngenetic propagation, as through increased cooperation and rule\nfollowing based on belief in a watchful god, assuming the religious\nbelief-forming dispositions were under genetic control and subject to\nselection pressures. Theological truth or falsity was beside the\npoint.) But since realists do not understand moral truths simply to be\na function of what helped Pleistocene hunter-gatherers to maximize\ntheir reproductive output, it would be a sheer coincidence if\nour evolutionarily shaped moral beliefs happened to align with the\nmoral truths, accurately representing them. And we are not justified\nin thinking that any such sheer coincidence has taken place.\nTherefore, we cannot have any justified confidence that our moral\nbeliefs accurately represent independent moral truths of the sort\nposited by realists. That is, our justification for our moral beliefs\nwould be defeated by these evolutionary considerations, at least if\ntruth for moral beliefs consists in accurately representing\nindependent moral facts, as realists maintain. (Epistemic internalists\nmay deny that the facts cited above would by themselves render our\nmoral beliefs unjustified, even on a realist model. But even they\nshould agree that once we become aware of those facts our\nmoral beliefs would thereby be rendered unjustified, at least given a\nrealist model of what it would be for them to be true.) So realism\nsaddles us with skepticism. And if such skepticism is implausible,\nthen realism must be rejected in favor of an antirealist view (such as\nmoral subjectivism) that would still allow for justified moral beliefs\ndespite evolutionary influences and our awareness of them (Street\n2006, 2008).\n\nOne response to this argument, on behalf of naturalistic realism,\ngrants the claim of pervasive evolutionary influence on the contents\nof moral beliefs but challenges the claim that this should undermine\nour confidence in these beliefs. David Copp (2008), for example, has\nargued that on the conception of moral truths implied by his\nsociety-centered moral naturalism, it is plausible to suppose that a\nmoral psychology shaped by natural selection in social contexts would\nyield moral beliefs that track moral truths at least reasonably well\nas a first approximation. On such a view, moral truths are grounded in\nmoral standards having to do with codes that would enable societies to\nmeet their basic needs (continued existence, stable cooperation among\nmembers, internal harmony and peaceful relations with other\nsocieties). Given the account of the evolution of human moral\npsychology sketched in section 2.3, involving the evolution of a\ncapacity for normative guidance in connection with promoting social\nstability and cooperation (ultimately, of course, because of effects\non genetic propagation), and further contributions of cultural\nevolution toward the development of moral codes fostering those same\ngoals, many of our moral beliefs would naturally have to do with\nconditions for social stability and cooperation. Since on the proposed\nnaturalistic view this is just what moral truths are about, there\nwould thus be a tendency for our moral beliefs to have been shaped in\nways that do tend to track moral truths, especially combined with\ncontinued cultural developments for correcting beliefs or attitudes\nthat fail to contribute to these social goals.\n\nStreet (2008) has replied to this proposed way out of the problem, in\npart, by noting that Copp\u2019s strategy relies on his intuitions\nabout what the moral truths are, as reflected in his society-centered\nmoral theory. But those are precisely the intuitions of an\nevolved theorist, ex hypothesi influenced by the\nsame evolutionary factors that influenced the moral beliefs in\nquestion. So of course we can expect there to be a decent alignment\nbetween our evolutionarily shaped moral beliefs and the moral truths\ndescribed by a moral theory spun by the very same evolutionarily\nshaped mind. Such a move, she argues, therefore cannot really help the\nrealist. It would be different if God independently (and convincingly)\nrevealed to us what the moral truths are, so that we could then go\ncheck our moral beliefs against them and perhaps discover that they\nline up pretty well; but instead, all we\u2019re doing is comparing our\nmoral beliefs with a purported list of moral truths yielded by a\ntheory we find plausible precisely because it is appealing to our\nevolved sensibilities (though see Locke 2014 and FitzPatrick 2014b for\nsome complications here).\n\nSimilar and even worse worries arise for a subset of non-naturalists\nwho grant the debunkers\u2019 claims about pervasive evolutionary\ninfluence on our moral beliefs and also insist that moral properties\nand facts have played no role at any point in the formation of our\nmoral beliefs, which have instead been caused by some \u2018third\nfactor\u2019 that happens to have brought about the desired\ncorrelation (Wielenberg 2010, Enoch 2011). One can, of course, tell a\nstory about some such third factor: perhaps the \u2018evolutionary\naim\u2019, survival and reproduction, also happens to be good, so\nthat in giving us moral beliefs that promoted survival and\nreproduction evolution also happened to give us moral belief\ndispositions that are largely accurate (Enoch 2011). But the question\nis again how one is entitled to rely on moral intuitions (e.g., that\nsurvival and reproduction are good) in telling that story, even\nafter granting that those intuitions are simply the product\nof \u2018morally blind\u2019 causes, i.e., causes operating entirely\ninsensitively to moral properties and facts. There are also deeper\ndifficulties concerning oversimplifications in such accounts (e.g.,\nregarding the \u2018evolutionary aim\u2019) and the fact that on\nthis approach the correlations between moral beliefs and moral truths\nultimately rest on a mere accident, raising doubts about whether such\naccounts can really make sense of the kind of moral knowledge and\nunderstanding realists think we have (Bedke 2009, FitzPatrick\n2014b).\n\nRealists have further resources, however, which can be deployed to\nsupplement a move such as Copp\u2019s, in a way that blocks the above\ndialectical worry raised by Street. Street\u2019s objection to Copp,\nafter all, has teeth only if the realist has already granted the\nstrong claims about \u201ctremendous\u201d and pervasive\nevolutionary influence \u201csaturating\u201d our moral beliefs\nacross the board. It is far from clear, however, why realists should\naccept such strong claims to begin with. As discussed in section 2, it\nseems doubtful that the scientific evidence itself supports such\nstrong claims about the etiology of \u2018our\u2019 moral beliefs. Even\nif there is significant evolutionary influence on the content of many\nof our moral beliefs, it remains possible that many of our moral\nbeliefs are arrived at partly (or in some cases wholly) through\nautonomous moral reflection and reasoning, just as with our\nmathematical, scientific and philosophical beliefs.\n\nConsider how a moral realist will approach the above debunking\nargument. It is intended to show us that realism is untenable, which\nof course means that this conclusion cannot just be assumed\nfrom the start. Yet if we begin the argument allowing that there may\nbe independent moral truths, then why should we accept the initial\nclaim about the pervasive influence of evolutionary forces on the\ncontent of our moral thinking in the first place? If there are\nindependent moral truths, then we may plausibly have grasped many of\nthem through autonomous exercises of our capacities for moral\nreflection, whereby we have come to recognize good reasons for\nthinking certain moral propositions to be true, by correctly grasping\nthat certain features of actions are wrong-making, say.\n\nFor example, your belief that human trafficking is wrong is plausibly\nbest explained by citing your reasons for holding it: you believe\nit\u2019s wrong for the reasons you give, such as the fact that it\ncauses tremendous suffering and deprivation, violates the basic\ndignity and rights of its victims, and so on. From a realist\nperspective, these features you cite in giving your reasons for the\nbelief are in fact wrong-making features of human trafficking, i.e.,\nfeatures that make trafficking wrong and therefore make true\nthe moral proposition that human trafficking is wrong. On this\npicture, you therefore believe that trafficking is wrong because it\nis wrong and you\u2019ve come to recognize the moral fact that\nit is wrong by recognizing the reasons why it is wrong (FitzPatrick\n2016).\n\nUnless realism has already been rejected for other reasons,\nthen, this picture is an open possibility at the start of the debate,\nwhich means that the realist is entitled to hold that many of our\nmoral beliefs are in fact not merely caused by evolutionary and other\n\u2018morally blind\u2019 influences, but are instead well-grounded\nresponses to moral reality. That is, the realist need never grant the\ndebunker\u2019s strong claims to the effect that our moral beliefs\nacross the board are saturated with evolutionary influence (see\nsection 2). Perhaps some are and some aren\u2019t, and the proportions\nwill depend on the extent to which we\u2019ve successfully exercised\nautonomous reflection in arriving at our moral beliefs, which is a\nwide open question. If there are enough autonomous beliefs in the mix,\nand we can identify them, then the rest of the argument will not go\nthrough (FitzPatrick 2014a,b; 2016,\n 2017a,b).[12]\n\nThe debunking argument would be strengthened if we had good reason to\nbe skeptical about autonomous moral reflection. In this vein, Street\nclaims that whatever moral reflection and reasoning we engage in is\nlimited merely to assessing \u201cthoroughly contaminated\u201d\nevaluative beliefs using \u201ctools of rational reflection [that\nare] equally contaminated\u201d (Street 2006: 124). The problem,\nhowever, is that this claim is based upon the very premise in\nquestion: the tools of reflection are allegedly thoroughly\ncontaminated because of the \u201ctremendous\u201d\nevolutionary influence on the content of \u201cour\u201d moral\njudgments across the board; yet our question is why we should believe\nthe latter in the first place. Until we are given independent reason\nto discount the power of moral reflection so radically, treating it as\nnothing more than using some rotten apples to judge other rotten\napples, we seem to have little reason to dismiss the possibility of\nautonomous moral reflection, and therefore little reason to accept the\ninitial claim of pervasive \u201csaturation\u201d of our moral\nbeliefs with evolutionary influence.\n\nStreet actually casts her argument in terms of a \u201cDarwinian\ndilemma\u201d for realists, which centers around the following\nquestion: what is the relation between the evolutionary shaping of\nmoral judgments and the independent moral truths posited by realists?\n(Street 2006, 109). As already noted, the best scientific accounts\nsuggest that there would be no special relation here, even if such\nmoral truths existed. But if there is no special relation between this\nevolutionary shaping and independent moral truths, then we would have\nno reason to trust our moral beliefs, which are as likely to be\noff-track as on-track, leading to moral skepticism. So the realist\nseems to face a dilemma: reject the best available science or\nlose all justification for our moral beliefs.\n\nAs brought out above, one way out of the dilemma for a realist is\nsimply to deny that the evolutionary influence on the content of our\nmoral beliefs is as pervasive as Street claims. The realist can grant\nthat where such influence does exist we cannot assume that it would\nhave pushed our beliefs toward moral truth: it may accidentally have\ndone so in some cases (e.g., influencing us to think we have\nobligations to care for our children) and it might have been\ndistorting in others (e.g., influencing us to downplay obligations to\nthose who do not belong to our in-group). But this is not a problem if\nwe also have a culturally developed capacity for autonomous moral\nreflection and reasoning that allows us to attain moral knowledge\ndespite the presence of some unreliable influences. Realists\nwill claim that we don\u2019t need natural selection to have\ngiven us moral beliefs that track moral truths, any more than we need\nthis in science or philosophy: all we need is for natural selection to\nhave given us faculties that we can develop, train and use in ways\nthat reliably track moral truths, and enough freedom from\nevolutionarily given instincts that we can so exercise those\nfaculties.\n\nFinally, Street challenges the realist to specify what faculty or\ncapacity might ground our capacity to arrive at independent moral\ntruths, how the former evolved, and how the latter could plausibly\nhave arisen as a byproduct of it. She claims that there is no\nplausible story to be told here, since the capacity to grasp\nindependent moral truths would have to be \u201ca highly specialized,\nsophisticated capacity\u201d akin to the human eye, and no such\nentity could plausibly emerge \u201cas the purely incidental\nbyproduct of some unrelated capacity that was selected for on other\ngrounds entirely\u201d (Street 2006, 142\u201343). But the\nrealist\u2019s story needn\u2019t take that form. The claim will be just\nthat our capacity to grasp moral truths\u2014like our capacity to\ngrasp philosophical truths about metaphysical necessity, say\u2014is\nsimply a byproduct of our general capacities for critical reasoning,\ncombined with the evolved capacity for forming and employing normative\nconcepts in our thinking and decision-making.\n\nA related but somewhat different debunking argument focuses on the\norigins of moral concepts (Joyce 2006, chap. 6). It begins\nwith the claim that we have a complete non-moral\ngenealogy of our moral beliefs\u2014a complete explanation of how\nwe\u2019ve come to believe what we do, which does not require any\nappeal to moral truths. Instead, we explain the origins of\nour moral concepts\u2014such as fairness, justice, and guilt\u2014in\nevolutionary terms, recalling that natural selection would have\nrewarded genetic propagation, not the tracking of moral truths, in\nshaping them; and then we explain our beliefs employing those moral\nconcepts in familiar sociological and psychological terms. The claim\nis then that the existence of such a non-moral geneaology of moral\nbeliefs makes the notion of moral truths \u201cexplanatorily\nsuperfluous\u201d\u2014just as truths about witches are\nexplanatorily superfluous given a complete genealogy of beliefs about\nwitches that does not involve any appeal to truths about witches. And\nif moral truths are explanatorily superfluous, then we should not\nposit them, any more than we posit truths about witches: we should\nremain agnostic about moral truth and give up any claims to moral\nknowledge. In other words, evolutionary biology leads to moral\nskepticism.\n\nThe critical questions about this argument parallel those raised about\nthe previous one. Even if it is granted that crude versions of our\nconcepts of fairness or guilt originated through evolutionary\nprocesses in our hominin ancestors, independently of any connection to\nmoral truths, it remains possible that through cultural evolution we\nhave developed refined conceptions of fairness or guilt that\ncan be employed in epistemically respectable ways (FitzPatrick 2014a).\nRegardless of how and why the concept of fairness originated, why\nshould we doubt that we can today use a refined conception of fairness\nto state moral truths, such as the truth that race-based voting laws\nare unfair and wrong? If there are grounds of skepticism about this\nthey would have to lie in reasons to doubt the soundness of our\nfirst-order moral arguments about fairness, rather than in claims\nabout how and why a crude version of the concept first arose (Nagel\n1997).\n\nAbsent such doubts, it\u2019s not clear why the mere fact of historical\nevolutionary influence should undermine our confidence in our moral\nclaims. To draw an analogy, should a theist give up her belief just\nbecause crude, ancestral forms of religious belief can be causally\nexplained without appeal to theological facts? Perhaps she will if she\nfinds no good reasons for her own belief, and concludes that it is to\nbe explained along similar lines. But if she has reflected on the\nmatter and been persuaded by a \u201ccosmological argument from fine\ntuning,\u201d for example, then it seems she might reasonably\nmaintain her belief, taking her employment of the concept of a deity\nto be epistemically legitimate despite the fact that other employments\nare subject to debunking evolutionary, sociological and psychological\nexplanations.\n\nIn general, the worry about Joyce\u2019s debunking argument is similar\nto the worry about Street\u2019s: unless we start out already\nassuming (against the realist) that there are no knowable moral\ntruths, it is hard to see why we should accept Joyce\u2019s premise\nthat we possess a complete non-moral geneaology of\nmoral judgment, and hence that it is explanatorily superfluous to\nposit moral truths. Whether or not the non-moral geneaology is\ncomplete is precisely what is in question in ongoing metaethical\ndebates: realists, who posit knowable moral truths, can reasonably\nhold that the correct explanation for at least many of our moral\nbeliefs does appeal to moral truths or facts that we have\ngrasped, while anti-realists, who deny the existence of such truths,\nclaim that the correct explanation for all of our moral beliefs\ninvolves no such appeal. The issue remains controversial. So unless\none has independently settled that issue against realism, one is\nunlikely to accept the premise that there is a complete non-moral\ngenealogy of our moral beliefs: there may well be a partial\nnon-moral genealogy, for the sorts of reasons Joyce gives, but it will\nbe complete only if none of our moral beliefs are\nthe result of our having grasped moral truths; and this negative claim\nwill be very unlikely if there are in fact knowable moral truths\n(since we would plausibly have grasped some of them, and they would\nthus figure into the explanation of some of our moral beliefs). We\nshould therefore feel compelled to grant Joyce\u2019s premise that\nthere is such a complete non-moral genealogy only if we have\nalready given up on the idea of knowable moral truths. But\nthat makes it hard to see how the argument as a whole can be used to\npersuade anyone who doesn\u2019t already accept its conclusion.\n\nIt is worth noting that the appeal to evolution to support general\nskeptical worries about ethics is not in fact new: it goes all the\nback to Darwin himself. Consider the following provocative, fanciful\nreflection (later echoed closely by E.O. Wilson 1978, 204\u2013206),\nwhich at least suggests a skeptical argument closely related to the\ndebunking arguments examined above:\n\nIt may be well first to premise that I do not wish to maintain that\nany strictly social animal, if its intellectual faculties were to\nbecome as active and as highly developed as in man, would acquire\nexactly the same moral sense as ours. In the same manner as various\nanimals have some sense of beauty, though they admire widely different\nobjects, so they might have a sense of right and wrong, though led by\nit to follow widely different lines of conduct. If, for instance, to\ntake an extreme case, men were reared under precisely the same\nconditions as hive-bees, there can hardly be a doubt that our\nunmarried females would, like the worker-bees, think it a sacred duty\nto kill their brothers, and mothers would strive to kill their fertile\ndaughters; and no one would think of interfering. Nevertheless the\nbee, or any other social animal, would in our supposed case gain, as\nit appears to me, some feeling of right and wrong, or a conscience\n(Darwin 1871, 73).\n\n\nThe argument at least suggested by this passage is that our moral\nsense, which generates our moral beliefs, has the shape and content it\nhas because of the contingencies of human ecology; had creatures with\na very different ecology, such as bees, come to be rational, they\nwould thus have developed a very different moral sense suitable to\ntheir ecology. But then which of these very different moral senses\ncould be expected reliably to track moral truths (if they exist)? The\nanswer seems to be: neither (unless we simply relativize\nmoral truths to various possible ecologies, taking such truths to\nreduce to facts about effective genetic propagation\u2014though as we\nsaw in section 3, such a move has little moral plausibility). For\nmoral senses are contingent products of particular ecologies in a way\nthat cannot be expected to track independent and stable moral truths.\nWe and the hypothetical rational bees will thus have very different\nmoral outlooks, each of which is explicable in terms of our respective\necologies and will seem quite natural to those who occupy the relevant\necology (while the other\u2019s outlook will seem bizarre), but neither\nof which seems to have any claim to be a reliable guide to moral\ntruth (as usually conceived). This imaginary exercise in\nperspective thus seems to support moral skepticism: the very idea of\nindependent, stable moral truths will seem suspect (playing no role in\nthe explanation of the origins of various possible moral senses), and\nour confidence that our moral sense would track them in any case will\nseem unwarranted.\n\nWhat such an argument overlooks, however, is precisely the factor of\nautonomous moral reflection that the bees\u2019 imagined\nrationality would bring with it (see sections 2.4\u20132.5, and\nMcDowell 1995). True, we might expect relatively unreflective and\ntradition-bound bees to speak of \u201csacred duties\u201d to kill\nbrothers or fertile daughters, in a way that lines up with the\nrelevant genetic relations that figured into the evolution of their\ngiven moral senses. But we could equally expect more reflective bees\n(the buzzing philosophers among them) to raise the question whether\nthey really had good reason to do everything that their\nevolution has disposed them to do in the service of maximizing their\ngenetic propagation. These more philosophical bees might consider the\npossibility that some potential goods of bee life, in the context of\nongoing innovations in rational bee culture, might be available to\nthem if they resisted certain impulses and acted differently; and this\nmight lead to the development of at least partly autonomous moral\nnorms, and hence moral senses that are a complex mixture of inherited\ndispositions and rational judgment.\n\nIf bees became rational, then, there is no reason to suppose that\ntheir moral sensibilities would simply reflect their ecology any more\nthan human moral sensibilities simply reflect human ecology: to the\nextent that they are really rational, we should expect some autonomous\nreflection, and perhaps even significant overlap with autonomous human\nmoral reflection, as we both strive for something beyond the merely\nbiologically useful (FitzPatrick 2000, 355\u201356, and 2017b). This\nis not to suggest, of course, that moral truths or objective moral\nnorms, if they exist, will be exactly the same for human life and for\nrational bee life, or for actual human life and human life imagined\nunder vastly different ecological circumstances. On any plausible view\nof morality, there will be significant variation in moral principles\nand/or their applications where there is significant variation in the\nbasic facts of life. Just as we could never live just like bees, bees\ncould never live just like humans, and no reasonable morality would\ndemand such a thing. Even a realist, then, will grant a significant\ndegree of cross-species moral relativism (or counterfactual moral\nrelativism for deeply different courses of human evolution). But it\nneedn\u2019t be the extreme and implausible relativism linking true\nmoral standards simply and directly to ecology, and whatever moral\ntruths might obtain for each species might well be accessible to\nmembers of each species through autonomous moral reflection, with at\nleast some points of convergence.\n",
