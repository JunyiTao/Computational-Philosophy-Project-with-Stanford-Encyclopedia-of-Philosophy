    "main_text": "Medieval Theories of Language\n1. Medieval Theories of Language\n\nMedieval logicians and philosophers of language were principally\nconcerned with the relationship between utterances, concepts, and\nthings. Written language was only of secondary importance. They agreed\nthat spoken language was conventional, having its origin in\nimposition, or the decision to correlate certain sounds with certain\nobjects. Concepts, however, were natural, in the sense that all human\nbeings with similar experiences had the same concepts, without any\ndecision being involved. The key semantic notion was signification,\nrather than meaning, though translated sources tend to obscure this by\ntranslating \u2018significatio\u2019 as \u2018meaning\u2019. For a\nterm to signify is for it to function as a sign, to represent or make\nknown something beyond itself. A typical spoken term, such as\n\u2018horse\u2019 or \u2018dog\u2019, signifies in two ways. It\nsignifies or makes known the concept with which it has to be\ncorrelated in order to function significatively at all, and it also\nsignifies or makes known something external to and independent of the\nmind. Modifications were made to this simple scheme to cover the cases\nof special terms, including syncategorematic terms, such as\n\u2018every\u2019 and \u2018not\u2019, fictional terms such as\n\u2018chimera\u2019, and privative terms such as\n\u2018blindness\u2019; and modifications were also made to cover the\ncase of special predicates, such as \u201cis a genus\u201d, or\n\u201cis thought about\u201d, but we need not concern ourselves with\nthese modifications here.\n\nTheories of signification were complicated by the metaphysical problem\nof common natures. If we say that words signify not only concepts but\nthings external to and independent of the mind do we mean that\n\u2018human being\u2019 and \u2018tall\u2019 signify special\ncommon objects such as humanity or tallness, or do we mean that they\nsignify Socrates and his quality of being tall? For Aquinas, who did\nnot want to give common natures any kind of intermediary existence\nindependent of both concepts and actual things, the significate\n(significatum) of a term was the intellect\u2019s conception\n(whether simple or definitional) of the thing signified; the thing\nsignified (res significata) was usually the property or the\nnature characterizing individual external objects; and the referent\n(suppositum) was the individual external object itself,\nviewed as the bearer of the property or nature. However,\u2018human\nbeing\u2019 cannot be said to  signify  Socrates, since the\nmind cannot conceive physical individuals as such. In the fourteenth\ncentury, further developments took place. There was a new focus on the\nnotion of a mental language superior to spoken language, and concepts,\nas parts of this mental language, were themselves regarded as having\nsignification. Moreover, Scotists and nominalists agreed that, at\nleast in principle, physical individuals could be conceived as such.\nWilliam of Ockham and his followers not only denied the existence of\ncommon natures but insisted that spoken words did not signify\nconcepts. As a result, both spoken words and the concepts to which\nspoken words are subordinated have the same significates, namely\nindividual things and their individual properties, such as the\ntallness of Socrates. Other nominalists, notably Buridan, insisted\nthat spoken words did signify concepts as well as individuals, for\nconcepts are required to mediate between spoken words and individual\nthings.\n\nIn addition to having signification, terms were also said to have\nmodes of signifying (modi significandi). These modes of\nsignifying were related to the term\u2019s logical and grammatical\nfunctions, and include such essential features as being a noun, verb,\nor adjective, and such accidental features as time (which includes\ntense without being limited to it), gender, and case. More generally,\nthey included being abstract (e.g., justice) and concrete (e.g.,\njust). They also include modes of predication, related to\nAristotle\u2019s ten categories, such as substantial (e.g., horse),\nqualitative (e.g., brown), quantitative (e.g., square), relative and\nso on. The notion of modes of signifying was developed from the early\ntwelfth century on, though it was specially emphasized by the\nspeculative grammarians of the late thirteenth century.\n\nIt is important to recognize that medieval thinkers had a\ncompositionalist view of language signification, and so words were\nthought to be endowed as units both with their signification and with\nnearly all their modes of signifying in advance of the role they would\nsubsequently play in propositions. Moreover, the doctrine of common\nnatures suggested that terms, at least those terms which seem to fall\nwithin Aristotle\u2019s ten categories (substance, quality, quantity\nand so on), each correspond to a common nature and so have a\nsignification which is fixed and precise. This meant that questions of\nuse and context, though explored by medieval logicians especially\nthrough supposition theory, were not thought to be crucial to the\ndetermination of a term as equivocal, analogical or univocal. It also\nmeant that terms which did not fit into Aristotle\u2019s categorial\nframework needed a special account. This problem relates especially to\ntheology, because God was thought to transcend the categories in the\nsense that none of them apply to him, and also to metaphysics, because\nof the so-called transcendental terms, \u2018being\u2019,\n\u2018one\u2019, \u2018good\u2019. These transcend the categories\nin the sense that they belong no more to one category than to another,\nand they do not correspond to common natures.\n",
