    "main_text": "Principal Contributions || Metaphysics\n3.1 Metaphysics\n\nAlthough Maritain did not produce a text that provided a comprehensive\nstatement of his metaphysics, his major contributions to the area are\nfound in Sept le\u00e7ons sur l\u2019\u00eatre et les premiers\nprincipes de la raison sp\u00e9culative (1934, A Preface to\nMetaphysics: Seven Lectures on Being), the Court\ntrait\u00e9 de l\u2019existence et de l\u2019existant (1947,\nExistence and the Existent) , and De Bergson \u00e0\nThomas d\u2019Aquin, essais de m\u00e9taphysique et de morale\n(1944). Discussion of his metaphysics are also found in other works,\nsuch as Distinguer pour unir; ou, les degr\u00e9s du savoir\n(1932, The Degrees of Knowledge), Science et sagesse\n(1935, Science and Wisdom), Ransoming the Time\n(1941), and Raison et raisons (1948, The Range of\nReason).\n\nAs one might expect, Maritain\u2019s metaphysics follows in the\ntradition of Aquinas, but it is far from a restatement of\nAquinas\u2019s views. For Maritain, metaphysics in general is always\nin need of renewal and defense (see Dewan 2009), and Maritain saw his\ntask\u2014and the task of Thomism in general\u2014as being \u201cto\nrenovate\u201d Aquinas\u2019s thought, \u201ca task whose novelty\nmay well be greater than [Thomists] themselves realise\u201d\n(Preface to Metaphysics, 1934 [1939: 12\u201313]). \n\nFollowing Aquinas, Maritain holds that metaphysics deals with being as\nbeing (ens inquantum ens), i.e., it \u201cinvestigates the\nfirst principles of things and their highest causes\u201d\n(Preface to Metaphysics, 1934 [1939: 27]). And Maritain also\nholds that there are certain fundamental metaphysical questions to\nwhich Aquinas\u2019s responses are largely correct, though they may\nnot be complete as they stand. Maritain adopts, against John Duns\nScotus, Aquinas\u2019s general position on analogy, being, and on the\nneed for analogical terms and concepts. Again, in answer to the\nproblem of unity and plurality\u2014e.g., how can a thing be\nindividual and distinct and yet a member of a class of things of the\nsame kind?\u2014Maritain follows Aquinas: that we have to distinguish\nwhat a thing is (its nature or essence, which it shares with\nthings of the same kind) from the fact that it is (i.e., that\nit has its own \u2018act of existing\u2019). When it comes to the\nanalysis of the nature and the unity of sensible beings, including\nhuman beings, Maritain employs Aquinas\u2019s distinction between the\nform and the matter of a thing; nature or essence reflects the form,\nwhereas the individuality is determined by the matter.\n\nMaritain\u2019s distinctive contribution is not, however, to the\ndetails of Thomistic metaphysics, but to bringing it into relation\nwith modern science and philosophy, and to explaining its foundations.\n\n\nFor Maritain, all human enquiry has \u2018being\u2019 as its object;\nbeing, in other words, is the formal object of the intellect\n(Preface to Metaphysics, 1934 [1939: 25]). But\n\u2018being\u2019 can be grasped in different ways, and Maritain\ndistinguishes, for example, between sensible being (\u201cthe object\nfirst attained by the human intellect\u201d) and being as being\n(which is the object of metaphysics). The way in which he does so\ndistinguishes him from several of the other leading twentieth-century\nThomists, such as Gilson and Fabro (Contat 2008). It is because of\nthis difference in object that Maritain distinguishes (as he notes in\nhis epistemology and his philosophy of nature, discussed below) among\nthe activities of the empirical scientist, the mathematician, the\nphilosopher, the theologian, and the mystic.\n\nMetaphysical enquiry\u2014the enquiry into being as being\u2014is,\nMaritain says, a mystery; being is, for example, something that is\n\u201cpregnant with intelligibility\u201d and too \u201cpure for\nour intellect\u201d (Preface to Metaphysics, 1934 [1939:\n4]). Nevertheless, the mystery of being is an \u201cintelligible\nmystery\u201d (1934 [1939: 83]), and Maritain holds that, unless one\ndoes metaphysics, one cannot be a philosopher; \u201ca philosopher is\nnot a philosopher unless he is a metaphysician\u201d (Existence\nand the Existent, 1947 [1948: 29]).\n\nPhilosophical reflection on being begins with the intuition of being,\nand Maritain insists that one needs this \u201ceidetic\u201d\nintuition for any genuine metaphysical knowledge to be possible. The\nintuition of being that lies at the root of metaphysical enquiry is\nnot that of \u201cthe vague being of common sense\u201d (see\nPreface to Metaphysics, 1934 [1939: 78]), but an\n\u201cintellectual intuition\u201d (Existence and the\nExistent, 1947 [1948: 28]) or grasp of \u201cthe act of\nexisting\u201d. (This emphasis by Maritain on the intuition of being\ngoes beyond what we find in Aquinas\u2014some have argued that it is\naltogether foreign to him [Wippel 2014, Knasas 1992]\u2014and\narguably reflects Bergson\u2019s account of the intuition of\nduration. As noted earlier, some have argued that Maritain\u2019s\ndebt to Bergson overall is much greater than he himself held [Gwozdz\n2010].) \n\nThis intuition of being \n\n\nis a perception direct and immediate \u2026. It is a very simple\nsight, superior to any discursive reasoning or demonstration [\u2026\nof] a reality which it touches and which takes hold of it;\n(Preface to Metaphysics, 1934 [1939: 50\u201351]) \n\n\nit is, Maritain says, an awareness of the reality of one\u2019s\nbeing\u2014one which is decisive and has a dominant character. This\nview of intuition is not, then, that of a hunch or quick insight;\nneither is it (Maritain continues) the same as Bergson\u2019s. It has\nan intellectual character, is a grasp of something that is\nintelligible, and requires \u201ca certain level of intellectual\nspirituality\u201d (1934 [1939: 49]). Maritain claims that this\nintuition of being is something which escaped Kant (1934 [1939: 48])\nand many subsequent philosophers until, perhaps, the arrival of the\nexistentialists. \n\nThere are approaches that one may adopt in order to acquire this grasp\nor intuition, but there is no method that one may follow that\ndefinitely produces it. This grasp may, for example, be acquired by\nfocusing on something real and then reflecting on what lies behind it.\nThus, this \u201ceidetic intuition\u201d or \u201cideating\nvisualisation\u201d is one where we \u201clook \u2026 reality\n\u2026 in the face\u201d, in which \u201creality [is] stripped of\nits real existence outside the mind\u201d and discloses \u201cthe\nconditions of \u2026 an existence of intelligibility in act\u201d\n(Preface to Metaphysics, 1934 [1939: 58]). This metaphysical\nintuition is, then, an \u201cideating intuition\u201d of things in\nthe perspective of their \u201cintelligible values\u201d, rather\nthan in terms of the actual conditions of their \u201ccontingence and\nsingularity\u201d (Science and Wisdom, 1935 [1940: 108]).\n\n\nAlso distinctive in Maritain\u2019s account of metaphysics is the\nemphasis on \u201cthe act of existing\u201d. It is because of this\nthat Maritain has been called an \u2018existentialist\u2019; indeed,\nhis Existence and the Existent, is subtitled \u201can essay\non Christian existentialism\u201d, and he describes his view as an\n\u201cexistential intellectualism\u201d (Existence and the\nExistent, 1947 [1948: 70]). Maritain believes that such an\nemphasis is characteristic of any consistent Thomism; \n\n\nWhat distinguishes authentic Thomism \u2026 is precisely the primacy\nwhich [it] accords to existence and the intuition of existential\nbeing. (1947 [1948: 12]) \n\n\nThis \u2018existentialism\u2019, however, is quite distinct from the\nexistentialisms of Kierkegaard, Gabriel Marcel, or Jean-Paul Sartre.\nAn \u201cauthentic existentialism\u201d, Maritain writes, \n\n\naffirm[s] the primacy of existence, but as implying and preserving\nessences or natures, and as manifesting the supreme victory of the\nintellect and intelligibility. (1947 [1948: 13]) \n\n\nIt stands against the position of his contemporaries who abandoned\ntalk of natures or essences or of their intelligibility, but also\nagainst those who imagine that essences were created and then came to\nexist. (For Maritain, essences do not preexist existence; essences\nmight be better seen as \u201ccapacities to exist\u201d [1947 [1948:\n34]].)\n\nAs one has the intuition of being and pursues this investigation into\nbeing, one is led into the traditional questions of metaphysics and\nnatural theology. There are, Maritain holds, four basic principles of\nmetaphysics: the principles of identity, of sufficient reason, of\nefficient causality, and of finality (i.e., every agent acts for an\nend). Though the truth or the applicability of these principles does\nnot admit of direct proof, they are consistently confirmed by\nexperience and, Maritain holds, cannot be denied without contradiction\n(Preface to Metaphysics, 1934 [1939: 90]).\n\nMetaphysics, then, properly includes an investigation into the\ncause of being\u2014i.e., God, in whom the act of existing\nis subsistent. Some sympathetic scholars (e.g., Yves Floucat) have\nnevertheless questioned whether Maritain ultimately had a consistent,\nThomistic view of what was the core of metaphysics (Floucat 1996). In\nany case, since Maritain holds that being is something that is grasped\nthrough intuition, one is not surprised to see that he will argue that\none can attain knowledge of the existence of God not only through the\nThomistic five ways, but also through intuition. (This is discussed in\n section 3.4, \u2018Natural Theology and Philosophy of Religion\u2019, below.)\n",
