    "main_text": "The Reception and Critique of Philosophical Professionalism\n5. The Reception and Critique of Philosophical Professionalism\n\nThe philosophical model established in reaction to Positivism\nblossomed in the 1950s as a result of the activities of the Chilean\nSociety of Philosophy, the regular publication of the Revista de\nFilosof\u00eda, and the internationalization of the\nphilosophical community. The society was recognized by the\nInter-American Federation of Philosophical Societies, the Institut\nInternational de Philosophie, and the Fed\u00e9ration International\ndes Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s de Philosophie. Foreign faculty taught\nregularly at the major philosophy departments in the country, and in\n1956 the first international congress of the Inter-American Society of\nPhilosophy took place in Santiago, featuring such prominent figures as\nMiguel Reale, Eduardo Nicol, Risieri Frondizi, Francisco Romero,\nJos\u00e9 Gaos and Jos\u00e9 Ferrater Mora. Presenters in the\nfields of logic, philosophy of science and theory of knowledge\nincluded Willard Van Orman Quine, Roderick Chisholm, Mario Bunge,\nFrancisco Mir\u00f3 Quesada, and Juan David Garc\u00eda Bacca. The\nlocal philosophical community could celebrate with pride the\neffectiveness with which the discipline had become a recognized\nprofessional endeavor both nationally and internationally.\n\nInitially, a new generation of philosophers embraced the high\ninternational standards of philosophical work proclaimed by the\nChilean philosophical community. In addition to Jorge Millas, new\nnames appeared steadily in publications and other professional venues:\nF\u00e9lix Schwartzmann (1913\u20132014), Marco Antonio Allendes\n(1925\u20132000), Humberto Giannini (1927\u20132014), Juan de Dios\nVial Larra\u00edn (1924\u20132019), Gast\u00f3n G\u00f3mez Lasa\n(1926\u20132019), and Juan Rivano (1926\u20132015). However, not all\nthought that the professional model was the only, or indeed the most\nappropriate for the conditions of Chile at the time. Some had come\nfrom diverse disciplinary backgrounds or interests, and therefore\nbecame skeptical of a model of philosophical activity that appeared to\nbe excessively subservient to international (mainly European)\ncurrents, and perhaps even irrelevant for the country. Juan Rivano, in\nparticular, developed a devastating critique of the levels of\nabstraction he found in the philosophical community, and questioned\nthe distance of his colleagues from the concerns of the nation. Coming\nfrom the field of logic, he questioned the lack of consistency in the\nusage by his colleagues of several key philosophical concepts. He also\nintroduced the work of British neo-Hegelians such as Francis H.\nBradley and Harold Joachim, but soon moved to the study of Hegel and\nMarx in such works as Entre Hegel y Marx (1962) and Desde\nla religi\u00f3n al humanismo (1965). He advocated a type of\nphilosophical work that was both critical of social and economic\nconditions, and more responsive to the complex changes taking place in\nChile and Latin America.\n\nThe wider philosophical community rejected the claims of Rivano and\ndismissed his call for bringing the discipline in line with the needs\nof the nation. They not only reinforced the foundations of\nphilosophical professionalism but also proceeded to develop a spirited\ndefense of a university model that sheltered the work of professionals\nfrom the demands of the larger society. The rapid expansion of the\nelectorate, the emergence of strong parties of the Left, and the\nexpansion of higher education enrollments all introduced pressures for\nuniversity reform which the defenders of philosophical professionalism\nresisted. In terms of philosophical schools, they continued to engage\nphenomenological themes, and particularly the work of Martin\nHeidegger. The critique of modernity was the dominant theme among\nphilosophers in their specialized work.\n\nThe most articulate voice from the professionalist camp came from\nJorge Millas who, following the Spanish philosopher Jos\u00e9 Ortega\ny Gasset, was a strong critic of mass society. In such works as\nEnsayos sobre la historia espiritual de Occidente (1960) and\nEl desaf\u00edo espiritual de la sociedad de masas (1962),\nMillas reiterated the claim that spirituality occupied a higher place\nthan materialism, and especially Marxism, in the concerns of the\ndiscipline. What was new in the context of the 1960s was the\nconnection he made between the aims of the discipline and those of the\nuniversity: both had the obligation to resist the pressures of mass\nsociety. Others who followed this line of argument, like F\u00e9lix\nMart\u00ednez Bonati (1929), and Juan de Dios Vial Larra\u00edn,\nemphasized the role of the university in forming an intellectual elite\ninspired by the higher aims of philosophy. They anticipated, in many\nways, the arguments of Allan Bloom in The Closing of the American\nMind (1987).\n\nSuch debates on the nature of higher education and the responsibility\nof philosophers merged with political competition inside the most\nimportant universities of the country. Philosophers who claimed to be\napolitical or who opposed the encroachment of politics in university\ncampuses paradoxically became a part of openly political debates.\nSignificant university reforms were introduced in the latter half of\nthe 1960s but the debates on the nature of higher education and the\naims of philosophy did not diminish. What did diminish was the level\nof philosophical production, which dropped consistently through the\nyears of the Salvador Allende administration (1970\u20131973). The\nRevista de Filosof\u00eda ceased publication in 1970,\nclasses were frequently interrupted, and books of a philosophical\nnature were reduced to a trickle. Perhaps the most important\nexceptions are to be found in a handful of philosophers, especially\nJorge Millas, whose two-volume Idea de la filosof\u00eda\nwas published in 1970. The philosophical community was deeply divided\nas a result of political turmoil and disputes over the aims of the\nuniversity.\n",
