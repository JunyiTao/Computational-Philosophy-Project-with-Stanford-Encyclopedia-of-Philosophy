    "main_text": "The Nature of Intuitions || Intuitions as Sui Generis States\n1.3 Intuitions as Sui Generis States\n\nA final family of accounts holds that an intuition is a sui\ngeneris occurrent propositional attitude, variously characterized\nas one in which a proposition occurrently seems true (Bealer\n1998, 2002; Pust 2000; Huemer 2001, 2005), in which a proposition is\npresented to the subject as true (Chudnoff 2011a; Bengson\n2015), or which pushes the subject to believe a proposition\n(Koksvik 2011). Such views are united in denying that belief that\np is necessary or sufficient for an intuition that p and\nin rejecting dispositional analyses of intuition. The close connection\nbetween intuition that p and disposition to believe p is\nexplained by claiming that intuitions typically serve as the ground of\nthe disposition to believe p.\n\nAccording to proponents of accounts of this sort, when one has an\nintuition that p, one does not merely represent or believe or\nconsider p. Rather, p is the content of a distinctive\noccurrent conscious non-belief propositional attitude. Bealer, for\nexample, claims that\n\n\nWhen you have an intuition that A, it seems to you\nthat A. Here \u2018seems\u2019 is understood, not in its use\nas a cautionary or \u201chedging\u201d term, but in its use as a\nterm for a genuine kind of conscious episode. For example, when you\nfirst consider one of de Morgan\u2019s laws, often it neither seems\ntrue nor seems false; after a moment\u2019s reflection, however,\nsomething happens: it now just seems true. (Bealer 1998: 207)\n\n\nSome philosophers who endorse such views also hold that perceptual\n(and other) experiences have propositional contents and seek to\nprovide an account of the distinctive features of intuition,\nperception and other seemings or experiences.\n\nAccording to the \u201cseemings\u201d version of such a view, an\nindiscriminate account of intuition would be the following:\n\n[A6] S has the\nintuition that p if and only if it seems to S that\np.\n\n\nWhile this account seems fitting for much psychological work on the\ntopic of intuitions, it is insufficiently discriminating. If memorial\nor introspective seemings with propositional content exist, they are\nnot plausibly identified with intuitions of the sort with which this\nentry began. Moreover, when conjoined with the view that\nperceptual experience consists of a suitable seeming that\np, this view implies that there are perceptual intuitions.\nClarity is served by stipulating that such states are not intuitions\neven if they are all species of some common genus.\n\nA more discriminating account is the following:\n\n[A7] S has the\nintuition that p if and only if it intellectually seems to\nS that p.\n\n\nSome, however, have claimed that there is an important distinction\nbetween the intuitions of primary interest in philosophical inquiry\nand other states which involve intellectual seemings that p.\nBealer, for example, claims that philosophical inquiry typically\nrelies upon \u201ca priori intuitions\u201d which must be\ndistinguished from the \u201cphysical intuitions\u201d elicited by\nscientific thought experiments in that the latter do not present\nthemselves as necessary while the former do (1998: 165). Those who\nwish to distinguish the states involved in scientific thought\nexperiments from those typically involved in philosophical inquiry may\neither endorse [A7] and reject the suggestion that such physical\nintuitions involve the same intellectual seeming or impose further\nconditions on those intuitions of distinctive philosophical relevance\nas in the following accounts:\n\n[A8] S has the\nrational intuition that p if and only if it intellectually seems\nto S that necessarily p.\n[A9] S has the\nrational intuition that p if and only if either [A] (1) it\nintellectually seems to S that p and (2) if S\nwere to consider whether p is necessarily true, it would\nintellectually seem to S that necessarily p, or [B] it\nintellectually seems to S that necessarily\np.\n\n\n[A8] renders all rational intuitions overtly modal in content and, on\na view of concept possession according to which possessing the concept\nc at t requires the ability to deploy c in\nthought at t, requires a level of sophistication not obviously\nhad by the philosophical innocent who is, nonetheless, presumably\ncapable of having a rational intuition (Pust 2000: 38; Ludwig 2007:\n136). Moreover, possibility intuitions are also essential to\nphilosophical practice and if the proponent of [A8] wishes to include\npossibility claims as the contents of intuitions (rather than treating\nthem as inferentially justified by a rational intuition and the\nprinciple that what is necessarily possible is possible), then they\nmust treat such intuitions as possessed of an iterated modal\npropositional content.\n\n[A9] (see Pust 2000: 46) requires a single occurrent conscious\npsychological state in rational intuition and distinguishes that state\nfrom physical intuitions while allowing that a na\u00efve agent might\nhave a rational intuition even though not currently deploying the\nconcept of metaphysical necessity. It also does not require that a\npossibility intuition involve an occurrent iterated modal content.\nHowever, because it leaves the distinction between a rational and\nphysical (or other) intuitions sometimes dependent on dispositional\nrather than occurrent factors, [A9] may raise worries about our\nability to discern directly that we harbor a rational intuition.\n\nSome philosophers maintain that such sui generis\npropositional attitudes do not exist or are not part of their own\nmental life. For example, Williamson writes,\n\n\nFor myself, I am aware of no intellectual seeming beyond my conscious\ninclination to believe the Gettier proposition\u2026 . These\nparadigms provide no evidence of intellectual seemings, if the phrase\nis supposed to mean anything more than intuitions in Lewis\u2019s or\nvan Inwagen\u2019s sense. (2007: 217)\n\n\nProponents of such accounts must be concerned to explain the error of\ntheir opponents and, ideally, to enable them to locate the states in\nthemselves. (See Chudnoff 2011a and Koksvik 2011 for attempts to help\nsuch skeptics by describing carefully that which they should\nseek.)\n\nWilliamson (2007: 218\u2013219) argues against analyses of the sort\nnow under consideration and in favor of a more permissive belief or\ndispositional analysis by noting that a wide variety of propositions\nmay be properly called \u201ccounterintuitive\u201d and that this\nclass does not consist merely of the negations of propositions which\nare, according to more restrictive accounts of intuition, the contents\nof intuitions. For example, Williamson points out that philosophical\nviews which entail that there are no mountains are often thought, in\nvirtue of such entailments, to be highly counterintuitive. The\nproposition that there are mountains is, however, not the\ncontent of an intuition on any of the accounts in this family.\n\nOne possible rejoinder to Williamson\u2019s argument would be to\ncharacterize the counterintuitive claim as the claim that no suitable\narrangement of matter is metaphysically sufficient for the presence of\na mountain (i.e., that mountains are impossible) and there is no\nreason why the negation of this proposition cannot be, on more\nrestrictive accounts of intuition, the content of an intuition.\nAnother possible rejoinder would point out that we have extremely good\ngrounds for believing that there are mountains and to suggest that the\ncomplaint that p is counterintuitive is merely the claim that\nnot-p is extremely well-justified.\n",
