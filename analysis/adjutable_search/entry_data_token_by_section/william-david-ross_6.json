Ross holds\n\u2018both in mathematics and in ethics we have certain crystal-clear\nintuitions from which we build up all that we can know about the\nnature of numbers and the nature of duty\u2019 (FE 144). Our\nknowledge of the basic moral and axiological propositions which are\nthe object of moral intuitions is non-inferential (OJ 121, 123; RG 29,\n146; FE 144, 172, 262, 320). They are non-inferentially knowable\nbecause they are self-evident or knowable on the basis of an\nunderstanding of the self-evident proposition alone (RG 20n1, 29; FE\n320). For example, that we have a responsibility to keep our promises\nis self-evident (RG 29). It is by a process of reflection on this\nproposition that we come to apprehend we have this responsibility.\nRoss thinks we can trust our moral apprehensions, and since\napprehension is a matter of knowledge, and knowledge implies\ncertainty, he is certain we have the above responsibilities and that\ncertain things are intrinsically valuable (RG 146, 29, 30; KT 42;\nSkelton 2007; cf. Audi 2004).\n\nThat our responsibilities are self-evident does not entail they are\nobvious to everyone who reflects on them. Ross says a responsibility\nis self-evident \u2018not in the sense that it is evident from the\nbeginning of our lives, or as soon as we attend to the proposition for\nthe first time, but in the sense that when we have reached sufficient\nmental maturity and have given sufficient attention to the proposition\nit is evident without any need of proof, or of evidence beyond itself.\nIt is self-evident just as a mathematical axiom, or the validity of a\nform of inference, is evident\u2019 (RG 29; also 12, 32; KT 42).\n\nThe analogy with mathematics is instructive, for we acquire our moral\nknowledge in the same way we acquire knowledge of mathematical axioms.\nWe apprehend that 2+2 = 4 by apprehending 2+2 matches makes 4 matches\nand 2+2 balls makes 4 balls, and so on. We apprehend the algorithm in\nthe particular cases after exposure to particular instances of its\napplication, by a process of intuitive induction (FE 170). We\napprehend it is prima facie right to keep promises by\napprehending it is prima facie right to fulfill this or that\nparticular promise. \u2018What comes first in time is the\napprehension of the self-evident prima facie rightness of an\nindividual act of a particular type. From this we come by reflection\nto apprehend the self-evident general principle of prima\nfacie duty\u2019 (RG 33; also FE 170).\n\nHow do we decide or form epistemic attitudes about our actual\nobligation in a particular circumstance? What one ought to do in a\nparticular case, as we noted above, is that act \u2018of all those\npossible for the agent in the circumstances, [that has]\u2026the\ngreatest balance of prima facie rightness, in those respects\nin which they are prima facie right, over their prima\nfacie wrongness, in those respects in which they are prima\nfacie wrong\u2019 (RG 41; also RG 46). To figure out which, of\nthe acts open to you, has the greatest balance of prima facie\nrightness over prima facie wrongness you look at all the acts\nopen to you and determine all the ways in which they are prima\nfacie right and all the ways in which they are prima\nfacie wrong and then figure out in each case the balance of\nprima facie rightness over prima facie wrongness.\nYou then compare the acts open to you in terms of their balance of\nprima facie rightness over prima facie wrongness.\nThe act with the greatest balance of overall prima facie\nrightness is the one you ought all things considered to do and what\nyou ought all things considered to do is what you ought or it is right\nto do.\n\nWhat is the relationship between the prima facie\nresponsibilities we have and the \u2018actual or absolute duty to do\none particular act in particular circumstances\u2019 (RG 28)?  Our\nself-evident prima facie responsibilities are not\n\u2018principles by the immediate application of which our duty in\nparticular circumstances can be deduced\u2019 (FE 84; also 169, 171;\nOJ 122, 127). Instead, one determines one\u2019s actual duty or\none\u2019s duty proper, by reference to \u2018all the\nmorally significant kinds it [the act] is an instance of\u2019 (RG\n20; italics in original; also FE 84, 186; OJ 126\u2013127).\nOne\u2019s actual responsibility or duty \u2018belongs to an act in\nvirtue of its whole nature and of nothing less than this\u2019 (RG\n28; also 33, 132).\n\nRoss is not exactly right here, for one has to engage in a fair amount\nof comparison of rival acts open to one in terms of their balance of\nprima facie rightness over prima facie wrongness.\nThe idea is our prima facie principles provide moral\nconsiderations or factors of direct relevance to the morality of each\nof the acts open to us. We have to judge with respect to each act open\nto us to what extent prima facie rightness outweighs\nprima facie wrongness and then compare acts with each other\nin terms of their balance of prima facie rightness over\nprima facie wrongness and then determine which act has on\nbalance the greatest amount of prima facie rightness over\nprima facie wrongness. The act with the greatest balance of\nprima facie rightness over prima facie wrongness is\nwhat you ought all things considered to do and is therefore your\nactual obligation. The act which is one\u2019s actual duty is the one\nfor which one is most responsible or to which the weightier of\none\u2019s responsibilities attach of those acts open to one (FE 85;\nRG 41\u201342).\n\nUnsurprisingly, Ross says \u2018[t]his sense of our particular duty\nin particular circumstances, preceded and informed by the fullest\nreflection we can bestow on the act in all its bearings, is highly\nfallible, but it is the only guide we have to our [actual] duty\u2019\n(RG 42). We never know, then, what we actually ought to do in\na certain situation. Instead, we have a \u2018considered\nopinion\u2019 or \u2018probable opinion\u2019 regarding what we\nought to do in a particular situation (RG 19, 30, 31, 33; FE 189, 190,\n191; OJ 122, 123, 127). In the end, the decision regarding what to do\nsimpliciter, to use Aristotle\u2019s phrase, \u2018rests with\nperception\u2019 (RG 42; OJ 127; Aristotle1109b23, 1126b4). It is\nimportant to note all of the responsibilities have a valence, positive\nor negative, and this valence persists even when a responsibility is\noutweighed by weightier responsibilities. So if one\u2019s break a\npromise one owes compensation to the person to whom one has made the\npromise (RG 28).\n\nOne point of clarification. Ross says the act which is our actual duty\nor obligation in our situation is the one, out of the range of acts\nopen to us, with the greatest balance of prima facie\nrightness over prima facie wrongness. It is possible, of\ncourse, all acts open to us will have on balance a greater amount\nof prima facie wrongness over prima facie rightness.\nIn this case, one presumes, Ross will say our actual obligation is the\nact, of those open to us, with the least amount of prima\nfacie wrongness over prima facie rightness on\nbalance.\n\nIn addition, Ross seems not to have considered fully the possibility\nthat two acts open to us might be tied in terms of the amount of\nprima facie rightness over prime facie wrongness\nthey possess. If two or more acts are tied in this respect, there is\nno act of those open to us having the greatest balance of prima\nfacie rightness over prima facie wrongness. In such a\ncase there will appear to be a conflict of actual obligations. To\navoid saying this, Ross will have to modify his view to say our actual\nobligation in our situation is the act, of those open to us, with at\nleast as much prima facie rightness over prima facie\nwrongness as any other act open to us.\n\nRoss\u2019s epistemology may be attacked in a variety of different\nways.\n\nOne issue arises with respect to Ross\u2019s contrast between our\nknowledge of prima facie duties or responsibilities and our\nknowledge of our actual obligation in a situation. Ross thinks we have\ncertainty with respect to prima facie responsibilities (RG\n30), but only probable opinion of our actual duty. Our lack of\nknowledge of our actual duty is due in part to the difficulty of\ndetermining the precise weight of a prima facie duty or its\ndegree of obligatoriness (FE 188).\n\nOne may dissent from both the claim we have knowledge of or are\ncertain we have the prima facie responsibilities Ross says we\nhave and from the claim that we cannot know (in some perhaps lesser\nsense) our actual duty.\n\nIt is hard to believe we could ever be certain we have Ross\u2019s\nprima facie duties. Ross himself gives reasons for doubt. As\nnoted, in RG he says in his original discussion of prima\nfacie duties we have a prima facie duty of justice\n(pleasure apportioned to virtue) (RG 21). A duty of this sort would in\nsome way constrain our duty of beneficence. A few pages later he\nrevises his view and says justice is not a duty, but a good that ought\nto be promoted as a part of our obligation of beneficence in which\ncase it would not constrain our duty of beneficence (RG 27). But Ross\nis less than clear about exactly what he thinks. After it seems he has\nsettled on the idea justice is a good he seems to suggest he is not\nfully convinced saying again justice is a duty (RG 35; for the same\nview, see FE 71\u201372). This suggests uncertainty about a prima\nfacie duty justice. And we may have similar uncertainties about\nthe status of other duties, including the prima facie duty of\nfidelity to promises. We may be uncertain whether or not the duty to\nkeep one\u2019s promises constrains the duty of beneficence (for\ndiscussion, see Phillips 2019, 186\u201387).\n\nIn addition, it seems in some cases we can have quite a firm view of\nour actual duty. Consider a situation in which you have to acts open\nto you. You are walking to work to chat with a student you have\npromised to meet. On the way there you see a child drowning in a pond\nand only you can save her. If you save her, you will not be able to\nmeet your student; if you carry on to meet your student, the child\nwill drown. So, either you break a relatively trivial promise to meet\na student in your office hours or you save a drowning child. It seems\nclear to many that your actual obligation in this scenario is that you\nbreak the promise. True, it is likely that you cannot be certain of\nthis but you can be as certain of this as you can be of any prima\nfacie duty (for discussion, see Hurka, 2014, 124\u2013125; Phillips\n2019, 187\u201388; Price 1931, 344; Ross sometimes agrees; FE 191).\n\nAnother worry is there is very little agreement in intuitions or\nclaims to self-evidence. This suggests for some there is no fact of\nthe matter as to what has value or what one is responsible for. Ross\nconcedes there is a lot of disagreement. His response begins by noting\na lot of moral diversity rests not on \u2018disagreement about\nfundamental moral principles, but partly on differences in the\ncircumstances of different societies, and partly on different views\nwhich people hold, not on moral questions but on questions of\nfact\u2019 (FE 18). He thinks most of the differences concern\nmedia axiomata, i.e., attempts to apply general principles to\nparticular circumstances, which rest on different circumstances or\ndifferent factual beliefs (FE 18\u201319). About middle principles,\nhe says intuitionists must have an open mind (FE 190).\n\nMany differences cannot be explained away in this fashion, however (FE\n19). There are differences as to the \u2018comparative worth of\ndifferent goods\u2019 (FE 19) and as to the stringency of the\nresponsibilities Ross endorses (FE 186\u2013188). These disagreements\nshould not, he thinks, undermine our confidence that there is\nobjective moral truth. But it is very hard to see a resolution to\nthese problems. He says despite changes in scientific theories there\nis a sense science progresses toward the truth. The same is true in\nethics. There is no reason to \u2018doubt that man progresses fairly\nsteadily towards moral truth as he does towards scientific\u2019 (FE\n20). The difficulty with this response is whereas in scientific\nmatters there is an independent way of establishing progress, there is\nno such independent or seemingly independent way of establishing this\nin ethics. Recent research in the social sciences on moral judgement\nshould not leave us confident (Greene 2008; Singer 2005).\n\nThe problems with Ross\u2019s moral epistemology are compounded by\nthe fact he thinks the principles of his framework best reflect the\nmain elements of common-sense moral thinking, and that this is\nnecessary to an acceptable moral theory. This threatens to make his\nposition appear parochial (Hare 1971). He is aware of this worry. He\nreplies by saying the number of principles intuitionism endorses is\nsmall in number and general in content and this leaves room to reject\nmuch of what is commonly taken to be right (FE 190). He also insists\non the idea the list of duties (goods) he fixes on are a result of\nsober reflection on what we really think where this involves appeal to\nthought experiments and judgements about particular cases (for\ndiscussion, see Stratton-Lake 2002b, 114\u2013118). This seems like the\nright kind of move to make to avoid dogmatism.\n\nHowever, it puts him in a rather awkward position. If it really is\ntrue the number of principles is small and it is possible therefore to\nreject much of what is commonly recognized to be morally required, the\nposition has a more reformist edge, and to the extent it is reformist\nit is more rather than less like the other views Ross rejects. In this\ncase, it makes it much more difficult for him to fault his rivals for\nnot capturing common-sense morality or what the plain many thinks. If\nhe attempts to move more toward the plain man\u2019s view, then\nalthough he can more easily raise objections to ideal utilitarianism\nand other views, he is much more likely to lose his critical element\nand therefore less likely fend off the charge of parochialism. \n",
