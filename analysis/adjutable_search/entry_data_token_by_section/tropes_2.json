    "main_text": "The Nature of Tropes || Property or Object?\n2.1 Property or Object?\n\nIn philosophy, new posits are regularly introduced by being compared\nwith, or likened to, an already familiar item. Tropes are no exception\nto this rule. In fact, tropes have been introduced by being compared\nwith and likened to not one but two distinct but equally\nfamiliar kinds of things: properties and objects (Loux 2015). Up until\nvery recently, that tropes can be introduced in both of these ways was\nconsidered a feature of the theory, not a source of concern. Tropes,\nwas the idea, can be compared with and likened to both properties and\nobjects, because tropes are a bit of both. Recently, however,\nboth friends and foes of tropes have started to question whether\ntropes can be a bit of both. At any rate, this will depend on\nwhat being a property and being an object amounts\nto, an issue on which there is no clear consensus.\n\nLooking more closely at existing versions of the trope view, whether\none thinks of one\u2019s posit primarily as a kind of property or as\na kind of object certainly influences what one takes to be true (or\nnot) of it. To see this, compare the tropes defended by Williams with\nthose defended by Mulligan et al. Williams seems to belong to the camp\nof those who view the trope (primarily) as a kind of object. Tropes\nare that out of which everything else there is, is constructed. As a\nconsequence, names for tropes should not be understood as abbreviated\ndefinite descriptions of the kind \u2018the \u03a6-ness of\nx\u2019. Instead, to name a trope should be likened with\nbaptizing a child or with introducing a man \u201cpresent in the\nflesh\u201d, i.e., ostensively (Williams 1953a: 5). Mulligan\net al. (1984), on the other hand, seem to regard the trope more as a\nkind of property, and as a consequence of this, argue to the contrary\nthat the correct (in fact the only) way to refer to tropes is\nprecisely by way of expressions such as \u2018the \u03a6-ness of\nx\u2019. This, they claim (again pace Williams), is\nbecause tropes are essentially of some object, because they\nare ways the object is (cf. also Heil 2003: 126f).\nIn general, a theory which models its posit primarily on the property\nhence thinks of it as a dependent sort of entity, as of\nsomething else. And a theory which thinks of its tropes more as\nobjects\u2014as \u2018the alphabet of being\u2019\u2014thinks of\nthem as independent, either in the sense that they need not make up\nthe things they actually make up, or\u2014more radically\u2014in the\nsense that they need not make up anything at all (that they could be\nso-called \u2018free-floaters\u2019).\n\nHow one views the nature of properties and objects, respectively, also\nplays a role for some of the criticisms the trope view has had to\nface. So, for instance, does Jerrold Levinson think that tropes cannot\nbe a kind of property because having a property\u2014being\nred\u2014amounts to being in a certain condition, where conditions\nare not particular (Levinson 1980; 2006). The alternative is that\ntropes are what he calls \u2018qualities\u2019, by which he means\nsomething resembling bits of abstract stuff. However, since a theory\naccepting the existence of bits of abstract stuff would be both\n\u201contologically extravagant and conceptually outlandish\u201d\n(Levinson 2006: 564), abstract stuff most likely doesn\u2019t exist.\nWhich means that, according to Levinson, tropes are neither a\nkind of property nor a kind of object. A circumstance that\nmakes him conclude that tropes do not exist.\n\nArkadiusz  Chrudzimski, next, has argued that, although tropes\ncan be viewed either as a kind of property or as a kind of\nobject, they cannot be viewed as a bit of both (Chrudzimski 2002).\nWhich means that the theory loses its coveted\n\u2018middle-position\u2019, and with it any advantage it might have\nhad over rival views. For, he argues, to conceptualize the trope as a\nproperty\u2014a way things are\u2014means imputing in it a\npropositional structure (Levinson 1980: 107 holds a similar\nview). Not so if the trope is understood as a kind of object. But\nthen, although tropes understood as properties are suitable as\nsemantically efficient truthmakers, the same is not true of tropes\nunderstood as a kind of object. Conversely, although tropes understood\nas a kind of object are suitable candidates for being that from which\nboth concrete particulars and abstract universals are constructed,\ntropes understood as properties are not. Whichever way we conceive of\ntropes, therefore, the theory\u2019s overall appeal is severely\ndiminished.\n\nBoth Levinson\u2019s and Chrudzimski\u2019s pessimistic conclusions\ncan be resisted. One option is simply to refuse to accept that one\ncannot seriously propose that there are \u201cabstract stuffs\u201d.\nLevinson offers us little more than an incredulous stare in defense of\nthis claim, and incredulous stares are well-known for lacking the\nforce to convince those not similarly incredulous. Another option is\nto reject the claim that tropes understood as properties must be\npropositionally structured. Or, more specifically, to reject the claim\nthat complex truths need complex\u2014(again)\npropositionally structured\u2014truthmakers. Some truthmaker\ntheorists\u2014not surprisingly, Mulligan et al. (1984) are\namong them\u2014reject this claim. In so doing, they avoid having to\ndraw the sorts of conclusions to which Levinson and (perhaps\nespecially) Chrudzimski gesture.\n\nA more radical option, finally, is to simply reject the idea that\ntropes can be informatively categorized either as a kind of property\nor as a kind of object. Some of the features we want to attribute to\ntropes seem to cut across those categories anyhow. So, for instance,\nif you think \u2018being shareable\u2019 is essential to\n\u2018being a property\u2019, then, obviously, tropes are not\nproperties. Yet tropes, even if not shareable, can still be\nways objects are, and they can still essentially depend on\nthe objects that have them. Likewise, if \u2018monopolizing\none\u2019s position in space-time\u2019 is understood as a central\ntrait for objects, tropes are not objects. Yet tropes can still be the\nindependent building-blocks out of which everything else there is, is\nconstructed.\n\nAccording to Garcia (2015a, 2016), this is why we ought to\nframe our discussion of the nature(s) of tropes in terms of another\ndistinction. Rather than distinguishing between tropes understood as a\nkind of property, and tropes understood as a kind of object\u2014and\nrisk getting caught up in infected debates about the nature of objects\nand properties generally\u2014Garcia suggests we distinguish between\ntropes understood as \u2018modifiers\u2019 and tropes understood as\n\u2018modules\u2019. The main difference between tropes understood\nin these two ways\u2014a difference that is the source of a great\nmany further differences\u2014is that tropes understood as modifiers\ndo not have the character they confer (on objects), whereas tropes\nunderstood as modules do. With recourse to this way of distinguishing\nbetween different versions of the trope-view, Garcia argues, we can\nnow evaluate each version separately, independently of how we view\nobjects and properties,\n respectively.[7]\n",
