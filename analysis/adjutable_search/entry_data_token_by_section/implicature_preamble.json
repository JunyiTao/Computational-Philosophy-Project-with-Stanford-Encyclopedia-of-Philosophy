    "main_text": "\n\n\u201cImplicature\u201d denotes either (i) the act of meaning or\nimplying one thing by saying something else, or (ii) the object of\nthat act. Implicatures can be determined by sentence meaning or by\nconversational context, and can be conventional (in different senses)\nor unconventional. Figures of speech such as metaphor and irony\nprovide familiar examples, as do loose use and damning with faint\npraise. Implicature serves a variety of goals: communication,\nmaintaining good social relations, misleading without lying, style,\nand verbal efficiency. Knowledge of common forms of implicature is\nacquired along with one\u2019s native language.\n\nConversational implicatures have become one of the principal subjects\nof pragmatics. An important conceptual and methodological issue in\nsemantics is how to distinguish senses and entailments from\ngeneralized conversational implicatures. A related issue is the degree\nto which sentence meaning determines what is said. Historical\nlinguistics traces the evolution of conversational implicatures into\nidioms.\n\nH. P. Grice developed an influential theory to explain and predict\nconversational implicatures, and describe how they arise and are\nunderstood. The Cooperative Principle and associated maxims play a\ncentral role. Neo-Gricean theories modify Grice\u2019s principles to\nsome extent, and Relevance theories replace them with a principle of\ncommunicative efficiency. Problems for such principle-based theories\ninclude overgeneration, lack of determinacy, clashes, and the fact\nthat speakers often have other goals. An alternative approach\nemphasizes that implicatures can be explained and predicted in all the\nways intentional actions and conventions can be.\n",
