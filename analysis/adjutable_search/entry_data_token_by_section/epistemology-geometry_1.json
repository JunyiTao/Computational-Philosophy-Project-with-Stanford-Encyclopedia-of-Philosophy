    "main_text": "Epistemological issues in Euclid\u2019s geometry || The question of diagrammatic constructions\n1.1 The question of diagrammatic constructions\n\nEuclid\u2019s treatment of geometry has, through the ages, been\ncelebrated as a perfect deductive presentation of a science, and\ncertainly Euclid made great efforts to obtain a most careful logical\nchain of truths. Book I in particular is impressive (see Lambert 1786,\nMueller 1981). Yet his proof-method gives a central role to diagrams,\nfor which reason Euclid\u2019s work came under severe criticism in\nthe late nineteenth century. This is because, from the early\neighteenth century, there was a gradual dominance of algebraic methods\nand a process of de-geometrization of mathematics, which evolved into\nthe so-called \u201carithmetization\u201d of mathematics. Diagrams\nwere demoted to the role of mere auxiliaries in mathematical\nreasoning, and a careful logical presentation of axioms and proofs was\nimplemented. One result of this movement would be Hilbert\u2019s\nwork, examined below.\n\nIt seems nevertheless true that the origins of geometric thinking\nhave, in different cultures, always been associated with visuo-spatial\nreasoning, and in particular with figures and diagrams. This is a key\nreason for the celebrated beauty and appeal of geometry. Kant came\nclose to capturing the spirit of Euclid\u2019s style of work when he\ninsisted that mathematical proof is based on the \u201cconstruction\nof concepts\u201d in intuition. The geometer works with carefully\ndefined concepts, for which Euclid always shows how to construct\ninstances (thus, e.g., proposition 1 shows how to construct an\nequilateral triangle given a line segment, and prop. 31 how to\nconstruct a parallel to a given line). But, as Kant emphasized in a\nfamous passage of the Critique, logical analysis of the\nconcepts could never provide the means of proof \u2013 an appeal to\nthe construction (say, of a triangle) is required, offering a concrete\ninstance either in empirical intuition (an external representation) or\nin pure intuition. Next, on the basis of the postulates, new elements\nare incorporated into the construction, which make it possible to\ninterconnect concepts and obtain new results. So it is that one can\nprove diagrammatically, e.g., that the angles of a triangle add up to\n180\u00ba (which, by the way, requires an appeal to the parallel\npostulate).\n\nThe proof of prop. 1 has famously been objected for having a\ngap. Given a segment \\(AB\\), an equilateral triangle is constructed by\ndrawing two circles with \\(AB\\) as radius, one centered on \\(A\\) and\nthe other centered on \\(B\\). The objection is that Euclid has no\ncontinuity principle, hence the existence of point \\(C\\) (the intersection\nof both circles) is not warranted. But such an objection ignores the\nproper role of diagrammatic reasoning in Euclid.  Manders (2008) has\nprovided an insightful analysis of how information is obtained from\ntext and diagram in the first books of the Elements, in careful\ndistribution of roles, which led him to distinguish between exact\ninformation (from text only) and co-exact information (taken from the\ndiagram). Notice that a diagram is not just a figure, but a reasoning\ntool, a semiotic element with rules of manipulation \u2013 and,\naccording to Manders, careful (implicit) rules for the extraction of\ninformation. For further details on this topic, see the entry on\n diagrams, sections 4.2 and 4.3. \n\nIn this connection it is worth mentioning a famous fallacious proof\nthat all triangles are isosceles, which Klein made well known. One can\nshow that this pseudo-proof violates the rules of the game of Euclid,\nextracting exact information from the diagram, which is never allowed.\nOn the other hand, one should notice that Euclid\u2019s postulates\nare not so much axioms in the Hilbertian sense, as rules of\nconstruction that are applied in the elaboration and handling of\ndiagrams. Most of Euclid's postulates establish that certain\nconstructions can be performed, the drawing of a line or a circle, the\nmeeting of two lines under certain conditions (this last is Euclid's\nown formulation of postulate 5 \u201cof the parallels\u201d).  As\nfor the central role of such rules of construction in Ancient\ngeometry, it is interesting to remark that the Greeks said\n\u2018diagramma\u2019 to mean a mathematical proposition. \n\nBut geometric knowledge, which began close to visual thinking\n(Giaquinto 2007) and the practical manipulation of symbols, i.e.,\ndiagrams as concrete representations, gradually evolved to become a\nmore abstract edifice. Already with Euclid, Archimedes and Apollonius\nthere is an effort to give form to well-crafted concepts, which make\nprecise, ideal, and general what was suggested by intuition; likewise,\nthe way of handling diagrams is anything but naive (see e.g. prop. 10\nin Book III, but also props. 7, 14 or 27 in Book I). And in due\ncourse, a critical stage was attained, when the assumptions of\ngeometric knowledge were made explicit and subjected to scrutiny,\nlooking for deeper foundations and for alternatives. At this stage,\nrepresented above all by the nineteenth century, the diagram had to be\nrelegated in favor of more explicit, abstract, relational methods for\nthe analysis of theoretical assumptions and developments.\n",
