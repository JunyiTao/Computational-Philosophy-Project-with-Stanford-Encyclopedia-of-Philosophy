    "main_text": "\n1. Life and Philosophical Works\n\nGirolamo Cardano was born in Pavia in 1501 from Fazio and Chiara\nMicheri. Chiara delivered her baby in Pavia, in the house of family\nfriends, and not in Milan, to defuse a possible scandal concerning the\nillegitimate birth. Fazio would marry Chiara and recognize Girolamo\nonly later in 1524, just before his death. After a difficult\nchildhood, saddened by frequent illnesses and the harsh upbringing by\nhis overbearing father, Cardano enrolled at the University of Pavia to\nstudy medicine in 1520 against his father\u2019s wish. Fazio\n(1445\u20131524), a jurist and an accomplished practitioner of\nmathematics and natural philosophy (in 1480 he had published an\nedition of John Peckham\u2019s Perspectiva communis\n(\u201cGeneral Optics\u201d), written around 1265), wanted his son\nto undertake studies of law, but Girolamo felt more attracted to\nphilosophy and science. When, due to the ongoing war between France\nand Spain, the authorities in Pavia were forced to close the\nuniversity, Cardano resumed his studies at the University of Padua,\nwhere he graduated in medicine in 1526. For about six years, he\npractised as a physician in Saccolungo, a village close to Padua,\nwhere he met and married Lucia Bandareni (1531). Three children were\nborn from this marriage: Giovanni Battista (1534), Chiara (1537) and\nAldo (1543). In the meantime, Cardano had been trying several times to\nbecome a member of the College of Physicians in Milan, but his\napplications had always been turned down, adding to his professional\nfrustration and disappointment. Rejections notwithstanding, he moved\nback to Milan with his family in 1532. He divided his time between\npractising medicine in Gallarate, a town nearby Milan, and teaching\nmathematics in the Piattine schools of Milan, a charitable institution\nfounded by the nobleman Tommaso Piatti in 1501 to improve knowledge of\nGreek, logic, astronomy, and mathematics among Milanese students from\na poor background. Fazio, too, had previously taught in this school.\nIn the meantime, his reputation as a successful practitioner in\nmedicine began to spread among the important families of Milan. In\n1539 his application to become a member of the College of Physicians\nwas finally accepted. Discontinuously, from 1543 to 1551, he taught\nmedicine at the University of Pavia, until 1552, when he went to\nScotland to treat the Archbishop of Edinburgh, John Hamilton, who was\nsuffering from a particularly severe form of asthma. Back to Milan in\n1553, he resumed teaching in Pavia in 1559. In 1560 his son Giovanni\nBattista was executed charged with the murder of his wife, Brandona\nSeroni, whom, against his father\u2019s will, he had married in 1557.\nThis tragic event represented a turning point in Cardano\u2019s life\nand intellectual career. In 1562, he decided to leave Pavia, whose\nacademic environment had become increasingly hostile, to teach\nmedicine in Bologna. As a result of mounting suspicions that he was\nactively spreading heretical views, he was arrested on 6 October 1570\nand remained in prison until 22 December of the same year. In February\n1571, before the Sacred Congregation led by Antonio Baldinucci,\nCardano was required to acknowledge and reject his serious crimes\nagainst the faith (abiura de vehementi), having been declared\n\u201cvehemently suspect of heresy.\u201d He solemnly swore that he\nwould no longer teach and publish books until his death. In 1571 he\nwent to Rome to serve as personal physician to Pope Pius V and then\nPope Gregory XIII. After having been admitted to the College of\nPhysicians in 1575, he died in Rome, on 20 September 1576, devoting\nhis last energies (from September 1575 to May 1576) to write his\nautobiography, De vita propria, published posthumously by\nGabriel Naud\u00e9 in 1643.\n\nCardano wrote and published a vast amount of works, in the most\ndisparate fields of knowledge, especially medicine, mathematics,\nastrology and natural history. His strictly philosophical treatises\ninclude: De arcanis aeternitatis (\u201cThe Mysteries of\nEternity\u201d, began at the end of the 1530s and published partially\nin the posthumous Opera omnia in 1663); De\nconsolatione (\u201cOn Consolation\u201d, 1543); De\nsapientia (\u201cOn Wisdom\u201d, 1544); De animi\nimmortalitate (\u201cOn the Immortality of the Soul\u201d,\n1545); De subtilitate (\u201cOn Subtlety\u201d, 1550, 1554,\n1560), and its twin book De rerum varietate (\u201cOn the\nVariety of Things\u201d, 1557); Theonoston (\u201cDivine\nKnowledge\u201d, written in the middle of 1550s and published\nposthumously in 1617 and 1663); De utilitate ex adversis\ncapienda (\u201cOn Gaining Advantage from Misfortunes\u201d,\n1561); Encomium Neronis (\u201cPraise of Nero\u201d);\nDialectica (\u201cDialectic\u201d), De uno\n(\u201cOn the One\u201d), Tetim seu de humana conditione\n(\u201cTetim, or On the Human Condition\u201d), De minimis et\npropinquis (\u201cOn Those Things which are Smallest and Closest\nto Hand\u201d), De summo bono (\u201cOn the Highest\nGood\u201d) and Guglielmus, sive de morte\n(\u201cWilliam, or On Death\u201d), all published in 1562;\nAntigorgias dialogus sive de recta vivendi ratione\n(\u201cAnti-Gorgias, or On the Right Way to Live\u201d),\nHyperchen (\u201cBeing\u201d) and De Socratis\nstudio (\u201cOn the Earnestness of Socrates\u201d), published\nin 1566; Proxeneta seu de prudentia civili (\u201cThe\nMediator, or Civic Prudence\u201d, published posthumously in 1627 and\n1663); Paralipomena (\u201cSupplements\u201d, begun in 1561\nand published posthumously in 1663). Other works were published\nposthumously in the Opera omnia edited by the French\nphysician Charles Spon (1609\u20131684) in 1666: Hymnus seu\ncanticum ad Deum (\u201cA Hymn, or a Canticle to God\u201d);\nMnemosynon (\u201cMemorial\u201d); Norma vitae\nconsarcinata (\u201cA Patched-Up Rule of Life\u201d); De\noptimo vitae genere (\u201cOn the Noblest Kind of Life\u201d);\nDialogus Hieronymi Cardani et Facii Cardani ipsius patris\n(\u201cDialogue between Girolamo Cardano and His Father\nFazio\u201d); De natura liber unicus (\u201cA Single Book\non Nature\u201d).\n\nGenerally speaking, Cardano\u2019s philosophy is heavily influenced\nby characteristic trends of late scholastic Aristotelianism, with a\nstrong penchant for Averroist interpretations. Cardano shows a great\ninterest in Averroes\u2019 opinion that one intellect would perform\nintellective functions for all human beings. However, he tends to\nprovide a historicized version of this radical view, in that he looks\nat the one intellect as the varying amount of learning accumulated by\nmankind throughout the centuries rather than simply justifying it from\na purely epistemological point of view (seen as the one intellective\npower that actualizes the life and knowledge of the sublunary world as\na whole). Cardano\u2019s philosophy also displays clear traces of\nPlatonic influences, absorbed through the reading of Marsilio\nFicino\u2019s recent translations and commentaries, especially\nPlotinus and Iamblichus. Together with his impressive knowledge of\nastrological and medical literature, both scholasticism and Platonism\ngive a characteristically vitalistic slant to his cosmological views.\nCardano\u2019s philosophy has often been described as suggestive and\nrich in original intuitions, but cluttered and inconsistent as a\nwhole. In fact, his philosophical work is yet another example, common\nduring the Renaissance, of how different philosophical traditions\n(including not only Aristotelianism and Platonism, but also\nEpicureanism and Stoicism, and not only Graeco-Roman, but also\nChristian and Arabic views) could converge into one composite but\ncoherent picture. Throughout his life, from his early endeavours in\nthe 1540s (De animi immortalitate) to the last philosophical\nattempt (Dialogus Hieronymi Cardani et Facii Cardani and\nDe propria vita), Cardano demonstrated a distinctive\ncommitment to a certain number of philosophical issues: the\nrelationship between oneness and multiplicity, with the notable\ncorollaries dealing with order and disorder, determinism and chance,\nlife and decay; the view of the intellect as the ultimate principle of\nreality and knowledge; a general theory of celestial heat, described\nas the main formative agent in nature; the interplay of nature and the\nsoul in the organization of the universe; a general doctrine of the\nimmortality of the soul, seen as the foundation of both cognitive\nclarity and moral certitude. As a whole, the originality of\nCardano\u2019s eclecticism lies in the unique way in which he\ncharacterizes the interdependence of life, knowledge and matter, in\nwhich a pronounced sense of reality and truth is constantly being\nquestioned and jeopardized by a realistic view of human nature,\nmercilessly presented as prone to fear, delusion and deceit.\n2. Life, Knowledge, and Nature\n\nCardano\u2019s cosmological views belong to a long-established system\nof astro-biological doctrines whose origins go back to Aristotelian\nphysics, Hippocratic vitalism, and fundamental assumptions underlying\nthe tradition of astrological and meteorological learning, reshaped\nthrough a series of Hebrew and Arabic mediations. His account of the\nsupralunary world combines elements from Neoplatonic philosophy and\nChristian theology. In line with many of his contemporaries, Cardano\nmaintains that there is a clear division between the supralunary and\nsublunary world. The life of the universe is the result of varying\ndegrees of celestial energy overflowing from the One, i.e., God. From\nGod to matter, cohorts of the most disparate souls mediate between\nthese two extremes. From a material point of view, the connective\nelement between heaven and earth is celestial heat. The principal\nconstituents of the sublunary world are matter (earth, water and air),\ncelestial heat, and a wide variety of souls (spanning from demonic\nminds to substantial forms understood as specific principles of\nlife).\n\nIn line with the principles of Greek ontology (and showing an evident\ninterest in the Renaissance recovery of Parmenides\u2019 philosophy),\nCardano maintains that nothing comes out of nothing; rather, all\nthings derive from something, and this something cannot be infinite\n(Hyperchen, OO, I, 284b; De natura, OO, II, 284a).\nAristotle called this something \u201chyle or prime matter,\u201d\nbut Cardano prefers to discard this notion of an intermediate entity\nbetween being and non being, replacing it with the view of the\nelements (earth, water and air) as the material starting point and\ncelestial heat as the efficient active principle, \u201cfor otherwise\nthe elements would be completely redundant if there were prime\nmatter\u201d (De natura, OO, II, 284b). The elements, which\nrepresent the first level of organization in matter, are three (and\nnot four as demanded by Aristotelian and scholastic physics): earth,\nwater and air (De arcanis aeternitatis, OO, X, 9a). As for\nfire, Cardano considers this to be a product of celestial heat, which\nis one of the various streams of vital energy flowing from the\nsupralunary sources of life and knowledge and which pervade the\nuniverse as one living organism. Innate heat of a celestial origin is\nthe active element that mediates between the state of utter immobility\nwhich characterizes intelligible substances and the incessant mobility\nthat defines the life of material beings. Through an exercise in\nintrospective analysis, Cardano enumerates three principles that\nregulate both our inner life and the life of all created things: one\n\u201cis moved and does not move, resulting from the heavy\nelements;\u201d another \u201cmoves, and it is not moved, that is,\nthe soul;\u201d the third, finally, \u201cis moved by the\nsoul\u201d and moves the body, i.e., the innate heat\n(Theonoston, OO, II, 304b). To the question of whether the\nsoul can be identified with celestial heat, Cardano replies that,\nunlike the latter, the former is incorporeal, does not occupy any\nplace and therefore is never in motion. Also, that which is in motion\ndoes not have that level of self-stability that is necessary for a\nbeing to be able to perceive (sentire) or to think\n(intelligere) (Theonoston, OO, II, 304b).\n\nIn Cardano\u2019s metaphysics, matter and form are complementary, in\nthat in nature there cannot be matter without form, and forms are\nalways with a body. Forms represent the primordial stage in the\nprocess through which the created universe becomes one living being.\nThe difference between souls and forms is that souls, albeit involved\nin the animation of bodies, remain nevertheless unaffected by\ncorporeal reality. Up on a higher level, minds are souls that are\ncompletely independent of matter, bodies and motion. However, even\nwithin the ontological sphere of the minds, there are varying degrees\nof embodiment. While the highest celestial intelligences are wholly\nseparated from the material cosmos, demonic substances, albeit\nincorporeal, can affect the corporeal world through forces\n(vires) and influences (influxus) of various kind.\nOne of these is \u201cthat force which is connected to demons,\nregardless of whether this power is corporeal and depends on humours,\nor it is incorporeal.\u201d Cardano maintains that it is through\nforces of this nature that \u201cthe parts of the universe are\naroused by demons, stars or some other hidden cause\u201d\n(Paralipomena, in OO, X, 446b\u2013447a. See also De\nsubtilitate, OO, III, 670a). The principle that in a way collects\nand administers all these currents of celestial energy is the soul of\nthe world (anima mundi). In Cardano\u2019s system of\nastro-biological determinism, the universal soul keeps the whole\ncosmos together and performs paramount operations in accordance with\nthe original plan devised by God and implemented by the planetary\nintelligences, for \u201call things are influenced by the higher\nheaven and are moved at the command of the soul of the world.\u201d\nThe soul of the world, which \u201ccannot be understood without\nGod,\u201d directs the work of nature, and, \u201cin the process of\ngenerating things, produces supercelestial lives and\nmultiplicity\u201d (De arcanis aeternitatis, OO, X, 6a). In\nthe sublunary world, the major operations of life and generation are\nperformed by nature, understood as a source of teleological activity\nsupervised by the intellect and the soul of the world (De\nsubtilitate, OO, III, 360a; ed. Nenci, 63). The complex\nrelationship between soul and nature, and the role played by celestial\nforces, is a crucial point in Cardano\u2019s philosophy (On\nCardano\u2019s cosmological views, see Ingegno 1980, 1\u201378,\n209\u2013271; Maclean 1984; Grafton 1999).\n\nRegarding the hierarchical arrangement of the ontological principles,\nthere is a certain oscillation in the way Cardano distributes them\nalong the various degrees of being, but by and large we can say that\nGod understood as the One represents the ultimate source of order and\nactivity in the universe, and all the rest emanates from it in the\nform of increasingly more plural and less integrated entities, from\nintellects to souls, from the soul of the world to individual souls,\nfrom the soul to nature, from celestial to earthly animals, from forms\nto scattered matter. In De arcanis aeternitatis, Cardano\nlists fourteen genera of beings, a number that, in his opinion,\n\u201cmatches the structure of the universe:\u201d three elements\n(earth, water, air), celestial heat, stones, plants, living creatures\ngenerated from putrescent matter (animantia ex putredine),\nquadrupeds, birds, fish, reptiles, human beings, demons, and God\n(De arcanis aeternitatis, OO, X, 8b).\n\nHigher animals are divided into four main classes: quadrupeds, birds,\nfish and reptiles. In the diagram he attaches to his discussion,\n\u201cthe nature of the animals is connected to the human one only in\none point,\u201d which is located in the area corresponding to the\nquadrupeds. See Figure 1:\n\n\n\nFigure 1.\n\n\nHowever, the margin of interaction between human beings and the rest\nof living creatures is ampler. In keeping with a number of Renaissance\nphilosophers, Cardano maintains that man is at the centre of micro-\nand macro-cosmic exchanges within the universe: \u201csince the human\ncircle corresponds to each single part of the whole domain of living\nbeings, all the properties and natures that can be found in living\nbeings will also be present in human beings\u201d (De arcanis\naeternitatis, OO, X, 8a). In Paralipomena, Cardano\ndefines the human species as an amalgam of forms (tota humana\nspecies congeries quaedam est), a \u201cmass\u201d that is in\nconstant evolution (succrescitat que decrescit):\n\nthis excellent human matter conceals the forms of all animals: the\nforms of the ox (although they do not feed on hay); of the snake (but\nthey do not kill with their bite); of the lion (but they have no\nclaw). By all means, the characteristics of the soul are exactly the\nsame (perhaps even worse); however, since these animal forms\n[concealed in the human nature] lack their corresponding bodily\norgans, they do not really seem to be the same (Paralipomena,\nOO, X, 446a).\n\n\nHuman nature includes all the forms of nonhuman nature, but they lie\ndormant, as it were, in a state of virtual energy. Cardano always pays\nspecial attention to those aspects of human nature that seem to\nindicate a close link with animals and lower forms of life.\nUnsurprisingly, comparative analyses between humans and animals abound\nin his works. Among the questions dealing with the relationships\nbetween human and nonhuman animals, Cardano is particularly interested\nin exploring whether reason is an exclusive prerogative of human\nbeings or it should rather be seen as the result of biological\ndevelopment (De natura, OO, II, 283b\u2013284a).\n\nAbove nonhuman and human animals, Cardano posits a universe teeming\nwith the most diverse kinds of incorporeal minds. He acknowledges that\nto count the number of celestial substances populating the supralunary\nworld would go way beyond the power of reason; and yet Denis the\nPseudo-Areopagite, \u201crelying on Platonic arguments and the\nvisions of St Paul\u201d divided them into nine orders. Within these\norders Cardano identifies \u201cseven natures.\u201d The first\nnature is the \u201cthe infinite, or God,\u201d eternal in itself.\nThe second nature is \u201cthe soul of all things or lives,\u201d\nwhich represents the first breaking up of the original unity; then\ncomes the already mentioned soul of the world, whose loss of\nontological unity and independence begins to manifest itself, being\n\u201cone principle resulting out of many and eternal ones because of\nsomething else\u2019s intervention.\u201d The fourth nature is the\nsoul which moves the universe, the primum movens, not eternal\nin itself, but through eternal temporal succession. The fifth nature,\nthe souls of the various planets, derives from the combined action of\nthis primary mover and the soul of the world. Various orders of souls\nemanates from the fifth nature: \u201cheroic\u201d souls, minds that\nare capable of having sense perceptions (mentes sensiles) and\nthe soul that presides over all sentient lives (communis\nsensilis). This last type of soul divides itself not only into\nindividual beings, but also into parts, \u201cfor everything is\nalive.\u201d The next nature, therefore, the sixth one \u2013 the\n\u201ccommon and vital soul\u201d (anima communis atque\nvitalis) \u2013 belongs to plants, lower animals and the\nelements. The last order is \u201cthe soul conceived in\nmatter,\u201d which \u201cPlato called idea,\u201d and Cardano\nsimply characterizes as \u201clife.\u201d Relying on later Platonic\nauthors, from Iamblichus to Denis the Pseudo-Areopagite, Cardano\ndescribes the universe as one single entity, seamlessly interrelated\nthroughout its vital expanse, placed between the two extremes of God,\nabsolute eternity and unity, and matter, the domain of absolute\ntransience and multiplicity (De arcanis aeternitatis, OO, X,\n6ab).\n3. The Soul and the Order of Nature\n\nOne of the most complex questions in Cardano\u2019s philosophy as a\nwhole concerns the relationship between nature and the soul. This is a\npoint where Cardano\u2019s multiple allegiances (scholastic\nAristotelianism, Plotinian Platonism, medicine and astrology) come to\nthe fore. Inevitably, it is also an area where not a few frictions\namong different traditions come to the fore. Among Cardano\u2019s\ndesiderata there was the plan to devote a specific philosophical\ntreatise to the notion of nature. It is an unfinished work that in all\nlikelihood he sketched at the beginning of the 1560s, De natura\nliber unicus. It can be seen as part of a series of treatises\ndevoted to the exploration of the most recondite aspects of the\nnatural, supernatural and moral worlds (De libris propriis,\nOO, I, 119; ed. Maclean, 293). De natura demonstrates\nCardano\u2019s lifelong engagement with notions of naturalism,\nuniversal animation, and teleology. The discussion is opaque at times\nbecause of the topic\u2019s difficulty, the characteristic obscurity\nof Cardano\u2019s disjointed and elliptical writing, and the\nprecarious condition of the text, left unfinished, with several gaps\nand marks of typographical sloppiness (typos, mistakes, and missing\nwords). On the other hand, being a monographic treatment of the\nmeaning of nature, the treatise holds great significance, all the more\nso because, as Cardano explains, the investigation of nature\n(inquisitio naturae) sheds light on the very origin of\nthings, including human beings (De natura, OO, II, 283a). In\nthis sense, fragmentary as it may be, Cardano\u2019s De\nnatura is an attempt to outline the ultimate principles of\nreality (on the relationship between natural and supernatural\nphenomena in Cardano, see Siraisi 1997, 149\u2013173).\n\nCardano\u2019s notion of order has strong Platonic overtones. Unity\nis a mark of perfection, for all things rejoice in unity and they are\nin a better condition when they reach that level of unity that\nactualizes their potential nature. Unity gives structure and purpose\nto all the elements that make up the system of nature: \u201corder\nand fate, since they are one, and exist with respect to the One, are\ngood; disorder and luck are bad, for they do not strive towards\nunity\u201d (De uno, OO, I, 277b; ed. Garc\u00eda\nValverde, 4). As an expression of unity and goodness, order is so\npervasive that in fact accounts for even the most haphazard and\ndisorderly aspects of reality. Cardano maintains that multiplicity and\ndiversity can always be brought back to potentially ordered series of\nindividual elements (multitudo ordinata) (De uno,\nOO, I, 281ab; ed. Garc\u00eda Valverde, 24; De natura, OO,\nII, 283a). What we perceive as beauty (decus) and elegance\n(ornamentum) in nature is not due to scattered variety\n(multitudo), but to a principle of ordered unity, \u201cthe\none in the many,\u201d which produces feelings of harmony and\nsymmetry in us (De uno, OO, 280a; ed. Garc\u00eda Valverde,\n20). The same principle of order and unity applies to knowledge: we\ncan say that we really know something when we manage to relate all the\naspects and properties of this thing to one cause. According to\nCardano, Plotinus followed the same approach in moral philosophy, for\nhe described his notion of happiness as a return to the One (De\nuno, OO, I, 281b; ed. Garc\u00eda Valverde, 24).\n\nAmong the sources of unity and order in the universe, souls play a\nmost significant role. As we have seen in the previous section, souls\nare at the center of Cardano\u2019s cosmos. Being immaterial, they\nare \u201ca unitary principle that is not continuous, nor contiguous,\nbut exists of its own, not in a place, nor in a time.\u201d Unlike\nlife (vita), which is diffused everywhere and therefore\ncannot be said to be a real principium, souls have no spatial\nand temporal limitation and are nowhere (nullibi) to be found\nbecause of their incorporeal nature (De uno, OO, I, 279a;\nGarc\u00eda Valverde, 12). While souls are one and individual\neverywhere (\u201cour soul is no less here than in the sky, no less\nin Italy than in India\u201d), bodies are different and manifold\ndepending on material circumstances and vital urges, for\n\u201cdivision of bodies is determined by the needs of life\n(vitae commodum)\u201d (Paralipomenon, OO, X,\n446a). Given the central role assigned to the soul, in all its forms,\nCardano\u2019s philosophy of nature is inevitably exposed to charges\nof animism and anthropomorphism. The issue is accentuated by the fact\nthat the human being represents for Cardano a model of rationality and\nteleological activity.\n\nFor Cardano, human souls are individual principles of self-awareness.\nSelfhood is the principal argument in favour of their immortality.\nHowever, in defending the immortal character of human souls, Cardano\nalso relies on proofs of a more pragmatic and theological nature. Hope\nin \u201cthe immortality of the soul\u201d was implanted in human\nbeings by God, therefore it cannot be considered as a deluded\nexpectation. In common people God instilled this hope \u201cthrough\nreligions (leges),\u201d in wise people, \u201cthrough the\nhidden truths (arcana) of philosophy.\u201d However, when\nGod provided human beings with hope for immortal life, He decided to\ngive them a feeble certainty, always in need of confirmation. The\nreason, according to Cardano, is that a firm belief in the immortality\nof the soul would have created too wide a gap between humans and\nanimals, while leading man into arrogant delusions of grandeur. There\nhas always been and \u2013 \u201cas long as there is a world\u201d\n\u2013 there always will be an alternation (vicissitudo) of\nconfirmations and doubts concerning the immortality of the soul. It is\na \u201cvicissitude\u201d of hopes and despair that is part of the\nprovidential regime of the world established by God (De utilitate\nex adversis capienda, OO, II, 26a). Hope in the immortality of\nthe soul is also a fundamental postulate in Cardano\u2019s moral\nphilosophy. As we will see in the next section, Cardano maintains that\ntrue inner tranquillity depends, among other things, on virtue,\nwisdom, and \u201chope in the gods.\u201d Otherwise, what is passed\noff as tranquillity is in fact mere harshness and stiffness\n(duritia) (Theonoston, OO, II, 303b, 305b, 308a,\n312a).\n4. Moral Philosophy: The Two Levels of Wisdom\n\nThe One (God), the ordered variety of nature (multitudo\nordinata), and the soul represent the main ontological\ncoordinates in Cardano\u2019s view of the cosmos. The universe is\norganized according to a plurality of orders, arranged along\nhierarchical levels, but harmoniously attuned to each other. It is not\ncorrect, in Cardano\u2019s opinion, to say that everything is for the\nsake of everything else (non omnia propter omnia), but rather\nthat everything is for the sake of one thing (omnia propter\nunum). This means that the One toward which everything else\nconverges includes many orders, \u201cdifferent among each\nother.\u201d Nature, art and chance produce a variety of causal\nsequences that often intersect and are more or less perfect depending\non the extent to which the end to be actualized prevails over\nrefractory matter. With respect to natural causes, some are universal,\nothers specific. Among the universal causes of action, the most\nimportant are the stars, which act over the sublunary world through\ninfluences conveyed by light, heat and motion (De uno, OO, I,\n279, 281; ed. Garc\u00eda Valverde, 12, 26). More specific and\nindividual sources of natural agency are demonic and human minds,\nwhich add to the complexity of moral and political action.\n\nAt its deepest, the principle of unity and order coincides with God.\nGod is infinite, necessary, wholly undivided, therefore individual. In\nkeeping with the principles of theological Trinitarianism, God is\ndescribed by Cardano in terms of power (potestas), mind\n(mens), and love (amor), and these attributes are\nnot \u201cthree gods, as Plotinus thinks,\u201d but original divine\nattributes. The natural world is a constant reminder that God\u2019s\n\u201cthreefold and undivided life\u201d flows into each single\nthing, down to the smallest beings (ad minima usque) (De\narcanis aeternitatis, OO, X, 6a). However, for all the layers and\nmediations that characterize Cardano\u2019s universe, the distance\nbetween human beings and God remains unbridgeable. Man cannot\nreconcile the finite with the infinite, for \u201cno finite thing can\nbe transformed into an infinite nature.\u201d Cardano rules out that\n\u201cthis life of ours can get close to that which truly is,\u201d\nfor there is no proportion and no resemblance between the two levels\nof being. Echoing Cusanian motifs, he argues that \u201ceverything\nthat is understood by a finite being is finite, for the act of\nunderstanding (comprehensio) occurs through some proportion;\nbut there is no proportion between the infinite and the finite.\u201d\nLikewise, our eyes cannot grasp the direct light (lux) of the\nsun, but only a glimpse of its brightness (lumen) (De\narcanis aeternitatis, OO, X, 4b\u20135a). Such a powerful and\nall-encompassing view of divine and natural order, in which the\npresence of latent Platonic and Averroist motifs contributes to\nstrengthen the cogent organization of the whole universe, has\ninevitable repercussions concerning the meaning of moral action.\nDuring his life, Cardano devoted a considerable number of works to\nethical inquiries, surveying almost every aspect in the field:\ntheoretical ethics, applied ethics, prudential behaviour, consolation,\neducation, and the role of rhetoric. However, his most important\ncontribution to moral philosophy consists in his attempt to redefine\nthe relationship between the universal scope of practical reason and\nthe need for human beings to apply moral laws to the concrete\ncircumstances of their life. This characteristic tension between\nknowledge and application is particularly evident in two works:\nTheonoston (which Cardano began to write around 1555) and\nDe utilitate ex adversis capienda (published in 1561).\n\nCardano presents De utilitate and Theonoston as\ncomplementary treatises aimed at implementing two different approaches\nin moral philosophy, the former based on the ordinary circumstances of\nhuman life (humanitus), the latter assuming the existence of\nsupernatural conditions such as immortal individual souls and the\neffects of divine providence (divinitus). They outline two\ndifferent paths towards the achievement of the same end: lasting\nhappiness. While the ethical program devised in De utilitate\nis designed to face situations of obvious emergency (quae oculis\nipsis subjacent) concerning human affairs (humanae res),\nTheonoston provides an account of the immortality of the soul\n(enarratio immortalitatis animi) that has momentous ethical\nconsequences (De utilitate, OO, II, 8, 39a;\nTheonoston, OO, II, 299b). The same duplicity of levels is\nevident in the way Cardano examines the notion of\n\u201ctranquillity,\u201d which represents the highest point in\none\u2019s virtuous behaviour: one type of tranquillity is premised\non the attainment of a certain level of \u201chonorable and moderate\npleasure,\u201d the other secures a decent degree of happiness\n\u201ceven in the greatest calamities\u201d (Theonoston,\nOO, II, 310b). Here it is worth pointing out that Cardano\u2019s\npragmatic approach to questions of moral philosophy works on both\nlevels, the rational and the empirical. In the final analysis,\ntranquillity is for Cardano the most useful thing that may happen to a\nhuman being, for it provides inner joy, long life, and a more robust\nkind of wisdom.\n4.1 Divine Providence, Immortality of the Soul, and the Highest Good\n\nDespite the emphasis he places on the benefits of prudent action,\nCardano believes that real, lasting happiness can be possible only if\nwe demonstrate in a persuasive way that the human soul is immortal and\nthat God intervenes actively in the human world, sanctioning a\nprovidential regime of the world. Two principles, more than any other,\nunderlie Cardano\u2019s moral philosophy: that the human soul is\nimmortal, and that universal order, being a direct emanation of the\nOne, governs all aspects of reality. Everything that happens has been\nplanned by God, and all that God has established can only be good.\nRegarding the immortality of the soul, Cardano maintains that, in\norder to lead a meaningful existence and act accordingly, people need\nto know whether there is life after death and whether the nature of\ntheir afterlife will depend on the way they behaved in this world. In\nhis opinion, Aristotle and the Stoics took the value of virtue for\ngranted. In actual life, human beings will never be persuaded that\nvirtue should be pursued for its own sake, unless they are convinced\nthat their soul is immortal (De utilitate, OO, II, 3). In\nthis sense, Cardano defends the immortality of the soul on strong\npragmatic grounds. Referring to Seneca\u2019s renowned instructions\non how to cope with the thought of death, he points out that\nmeditating about death while maintaining that the soul is mortal is\nsimply absurd. In his eyes, Seneca is a bad rhetorician and an\nEpicurean in disguise, who exhorts us to die serenely while claiming\nthat there is nothing after death (De utilitate, OO, II, 10a;\nsee Giglioni 2012, 187).\n\nAs we have seen while examining his natural philosophy,\nCardano\u2019s moral views assign a central role to the soul:\n\u201cThe soul is the most important thing we own; everything refers\nto it, for riches, honors, and health are nothing without a sound\nsoul\u201d (De utilitate, OO, II, 10a). Mental\nself-awareness, in particular, is the principal argument through which\nCardano advocates the immortality of the soul, for a human being is\nthe same thing as his mind (homo animus est) (De\nutilitate, OO, II, 12; on Cardano\u2019s notion of the mind, see\nGiglioni 2005\u20132007; Garc\u00eda Valverde 2013). The same\nemphasis on mental awareness can be found in Cardano\u2019s moral\ninvestigations, for in his opinion human beings cannot understand what\nthe ends of their actions are if they lack a clear knowledge of\nthemselves (De utilitate, OO, II, 2). The highest good for\nthem can only lie in those attributes and activities that are part of\ntheir minds (quae animo coniuncta sunt) (De\nutilitate, OO, II, 27a). In this sense, the relationship between\ntranquillity and awareness is biunique: human beings can be peaceful\nonly when they know what the highest good is and know that they have\nattained it (Theonoston, OO, II, 303b). According to the\nHermit\u2019s definition of tranquillity in Theonoston,\ntranquillitas coincides with securitas, that is, a\ncondition of unbreakable inner peace, free from cares and anxiety, and\nit is a level of wisdom that would even suit God. In this respect,\ntrue tranquillity for human beings coincides with their being\n\u201cassimilated\u201d to God, so that, when this condition of\nserenity is reached, nothing is any longer felt as lacking in meaning\nand substance. This level of happiness is a \u201ckind of\npleasure\u201d that derives from the awareness of \u201cbeing in the\npossession of goods\u201d (Theonoston, OO, II, 302a; De\noptimo vitae genere, OO, I, 488b). Intellectual pleasure should\nnever be a monstrum, that is to say, a hybrid creature\nresulting from combining the goods of reason with those of the body\nand external luck (Theonoston, OO, II, 313b\u2013314a).\n\nBy doing so, Cardano provides a definition of happiness which is\ninclusive of both knowledge and pleasure. Happiness consists in a\n\u201cperception of pleasure\u201d that is great (magna),\nfull (plena), pure (pura), untroubled\n(secura), and safe (tuta) (De utilitate,\nOO, II, 37b; Theonoston, OO, II, 305b; De libris\npropriis, OO, I, 76b; ed. Maclean, 212\u2013213). In\nTheonoston, happiness is said to coincide with a kind of\ninner composure understood not in terms of lack of sensibility\n(indolentia), but as a condition of mental vigour stemming\nfrom the contemplation of the true nature of things. If tranquillity\nconsisted in mere refractoriness to unsettling experiences, the\nimpassive state of a stone should then be viewed as the best condition\n(Theonoston, OO, II, 299b, 305b, 313b). By contrast, ethical\npeace rests on a state of cognitive tension and focus. In ways that\nremind us of the sea and the air, undisturbed calm (tranquilla\nquies) is always accompanied by a current of \u201clight\nmotion,\u201d i.e., a state of balance between opposite conditions\n\u201cwhich does not unsettle, but delights us.\u201d\nCardano\u2019s tranquillitas is therefore not the same as\nabsolute rest: \u201cin its state of highest tranquillity, our soul\nis as it were tremulous and breathing\u201d (Theonoston, OO,\nII, 300a, 305b). The incessant vitality of our being demonstrates that\n\u201cthe matter we are made of, being of a celestial origin,\nproduced and entwined with motion, does not enjoy rest, but thrives on\nmotion,\u201d a motion that, in the final analysis, is no bodily\nactivity, but an expression of knowledge and intellect\n(Theonoston, OO, II, 304a). True tranquillity results from a\ncondition of inviolable self-fulfilment (securitas) based on\nresources that are in our power (in nostra potestate esse).\nCardano is not convinced by the Senecan view of tranquillity as a\nbalanced active life (vita actuosa), or by Socrates\u2019s\nkind of \u2018engaged\u2019 tranquillity; in both cases, their\nbehaviour is for Cardano symptomatic of ambition rather than being the\nindication of a truly committed philosophical life\n(Theonoston, OO, II, 306b). Finally, Cardano rejects the\nideals of tranquillity championed by Plutarch, Antoninus and Cicero,\nviewed as models of ethical escapism devised by men who in their life\nnever managed to reach a condition of stable serenity\n(Theonoston, OO, II, 305a).\n\nIn outlining his views about the nature of the good, Cardano is\nfollowing a deliberately eclectic approach. He combines the Stoic\nconception of virtue with Epicurus\u2019 emphasis on indifference\n(indolentia), Aristotle\u2019s notion of virtuous life with\nAverroes\u2019 characterization of happiness as the highest level of\nknowledge accessible to human beings. He justifies his eclectic\nposition by arguing that philosophers who were so clever in their\nfields are likely to have come up with closely related ideas and that\ntherefore \u201ctwo or more of their opinions can converge into\none\u201d (De utilitate, OO, II, 24b). From Socrates, for\ninstance, Cardano draws the principle that only wise people can be\ntruly happy because virtue lies in knowledge (De utilitate,\nOO, II, 90b). From medical authors, he borrows the view that pleasure\nalways follows release from a condition of tension or pain (De\nutilitate, OO, II, 28a). Following traditional argumentative\npatterns in moral philosophy, Cardano distinguishes among goods of the\nmind (virtues), goods of the body (health, longevity), and goods of\nfortune. Among the goods of fortune, Cardano lists finding the right\nwife, a lasting fame, and a painless death (De utilitate, OO,\nII, 19b). Goods of the body, such as enjoying good health and\nfollowing a healthy regimen, are also part of one\u2019s happiness\n(De utilitate, OO, II, 19a; on Cardano\u2019s notion of\nhealth, see Siraisi, 70\u201390).\n\nStrictly speaking, goods and ills are values. As such, they transcend\nthe level of nature and therefore cannot be treated as if they were\nnatural or against nature: \u201cGoods and ills reside in the soul;\nfaculties and defects in the body; helps and impediments in fortune\nand its occurrences\u201d (Theonoston, OO, II, 314b). In\ngeneral terms, Cardano defines the good as \u201cwhat is longed for\nby the majority of human beings,\u201d such as health, wealth,\nfriends, glory, offspring and wisdom. In a more specific sense\n(simpliciter), good is what is everlasting\n(perpetuum), safe (securum), and unchangeable\n(immutabile) (De utilitate, OO, II, 23ab). In order\nto achieve a stable condition of inner peace people need to commit to\na good that cannot be taken away from them. Ultimately, since only God\nhas all the requisites to be this kind of imperishable good, the more\ngenuine meaning of good is that which brings us closer to God or make\nus similar to Him (Theonoston, OO, II, 307b\u2013308a,\n313b). The difference between human beings and God is that in God the\ngood (bonum) coincides entirely with self-preservation\n(vita incolumis), whereas in human beings these two\nconditions are generally separate. Human beings need to take care of\ntheir life and aim at a life that is marked by reason. There cannot be\nany discourse on happiness where the primary requisites for life are\nlacking (due to mental illness or death) (Theonoston, OO, II,\n309b).\n\nGoods of the mind are virtues. By virtue, Cardano means the principle\nthat teaches human beings to behave in the best way towards God,\nanimals and our fellow human beings. Hence the key virtues are sense\nof duty (pietas), compassion (humanitas), and\nkindness (benignitas) (Theonoston, OO, II, 312ab).\nGiven their importance, virtues are among the foundations of human\naction: \u201cby its nature, virtue is eternal and a divine good in\nus; all the rest rots in time and depends on circumstances\u201d\n(De utilitate, OO, II, 21a. See ibid., 38b) . Emanating from\nthe innermost part of our rational soul, virtues have the power to\nretroact on our mind, thus fortifying and safeguarding its faculties.\nThe most prophylactic among virtues are fortitude, prudence and\nmoderation, and they result from the combined actions of nature, habit\nand reason, establishing a delicate balance between control of natural\nimpulses (impetus naturae), education, and the process of\ndecision making.\n\nAs already said, Cardano\u2019s moral philosophy rests on a series of\ninterrelated principles which also play a key foundational role in\nnatural philosophy: that the soul is immortal; that incorporeal lives\nare everlasting; and that mental awareness is the defining\ncharacteristic of the soul. Since the intellect is the only thing that\nhumans can boast about themselves as being truly immortal,\nintellectual self-knowledge is regarded by Cardano as the highest good\nthat a human being may ever attain. Inevitably, this assumption\nre-proposes the Averroist conundrum about whether the mind belongs to\nhumankind as a whole or it informs the life and knowledge of each\nindividual human being. Cardano seems to suggest that the mind\ntranscends individual human beings ([mens] superior est\nhomini), for happiness coincides with eternal life: \u201che who\ndoes not live long cannot be happy for long\u201d (De\nutilitate, OO, II, 23ab; on Averroism in Cardano, see\nGarc\u00eda Valverde 2013). There cannot be happiness in human life\nif there is no afterlife for the soul. On this point, Cardano follows\nSt Paul\u2019s argument in his Letter to the Romans (8:\n20\u201322):\n\nIf our soul did not survive death, we would be much unhappier than\nanimals are. For, besides the fact that no animal, apart from the\nhuman being, knows that it is going to die, all non human animals\n(bruta) enjoy some happiness for the very fact that they\nexist, since they live as if they were to live forever, and therefore\nthey participate in eternal bliss. Only human beings are separated\nfrom eternity, even in their thought, for not only do they know that\nthey can die, but they also are aware that they will inevitably die,\nand die within a pre-established time (De utilitate, OO, II,\n24a).\n\n\nCardano\u2019s reflections on mental happiness, assimilation to God,\nand universal intelligibility should be read against the background of\ncontemporary discussions about the Averroist notion of intellectual\nbeatitude. There is no doubt that, when Cardano characterizes the\nhighest good as the union of the soul with God, his definition is full\nof Aristotelian and Averroistic resonances. The summum bonum,\nhe argues in De utilitate ex adversis capienda, is \u201cto\nbe assimilated to the highest good,\u201d i.e., God. Unlike other\nkinds of love, love of God is \u201chonest\u201d and\n\u201csafe,\u201d for its object never deserts the seeking soul\n(De utilitate, OO, II, 6, 25a. 500a; De sapientia,\nOO, I, 500\u2013501; ed. Bracali, 30\u201336). Elsewhere,\nCardano\u2019s definition of summum bonum is suppler and\nimplies such components as wisdom (sapientia), virtue\n(especially fortitude and prudence), and progeny: wisdom is\ndistinctively human; expressions of fortitude and prudence can also be\nseen in several animals; to have children, finally, is a prerogative\nthat belongs to almost all living beings. It is a sort of pyramidal\nmodel of virtue, with fertility at the basis and wisdom at the top\n(only very few people can reach wisdom) (De utilitate, OO,\nII, 25b; Theonoston, OO, II, 302b; on Cardano\u2019s views\non virtue, see Ingegno 1980, 318\u201376).\n4.2 Prudence and Practical Wisdom\n\nThe characteristic oscillation between intellectual good and\nprosperous life is particularly evident in De utilitate ex\nadversis capienda. This work is meant to provide directions on\nhow to overcome difficult situations and lead a reasonably serene life\nrelying only on the material conditions of one\u2019s existence and\non the information that one can get from sensible experience. Contrary\nto the approach followed in Theonoston, in De\nutilitate Cardano focuses on the kind of happiness that one can\nreach in this life, advancing the hypothesis \u2013 to be understood\nin an experimental sense \u2013 that there is no survival of the soul\n(etiam sublata immortalitate) (De utilitate, II, 5).\nIn this case, the moral actor is confronted not so much with the goods\nattainable by the mind as with the ills that the mind needs to\ntransform into opportunities for inner exercise or practical gain.\nCardano divides ills (mala) into external and internal. They\nboth can be measured according to the impact they have on our lives\n(magnitudo) and the level of constraint they impose on our\nactions (necessitas). External ills depend on the variable\narrangement of external events (fortunae arbitrium) and on\nthe shifting states of the body. Although, properly speaking, the body\nis \u201cno part of ourselves,\u201d nevertheless, it communicates\nwith our mind. Internal ills are all those passions that can be hardly\neradicated from our soul, such as madness, anger, fear, and envy.\nSince they are located within the soul (animus), it is\nexceedingly difficult to turn them into something useful and\nproductive unless we undergo a radical transformation of our self\n(De utilitate, OO, II, 11b\u201312a, 13b).\n\nCardano claims that there can be five kinds of responses to calamities\nin one\u2019s life. The first two are \u201cparadoxical\u201d and\nhave nothing relevant to say about possible applications to the\npractical aspects of one\u2019s life. These are the Christian and the\nStoic responses: adversities are either good in themselves, or they\nhave absolutely no incidence in someone\u2019s happiness. The\nremaining three kinds of response are of a \u201cpragmatic\u201d\nnature, for they appeal to the human senses and have possible social\noutcomes. First, they teach us how to avoid misfortunes or mitigate\nthe impact they have on our life; second, in case they happen, they\ndirect our attention to ways of coping with misfortunes or escape\ndangerous consequences; third, they tell us how to gain \u201csome\ngood\u201d out of \u201cany kind of ill\u201d (De\nutilitate, OO, II, 10b, 27b, 39a). For Cardano, this ethical\nprogram in three stages is an approach that suits people involved in\nthe many activities of civic life and helps meet their social\ncommitments. The distinctive trait of prudent people is their ability\nto turn difficulties into opportunities of knowledge and moral\nbetterment (De utilitate, OO, II, 11a). Regarding the\n\u201cparadoxical\u201d attitudes to calamities displayed by Stoic\nand Christian sages, Cardano thinks that there is a great difference\nbetween the situation in which the wise man is deemed capable of\n\u201cbearing calamities with fortitude\u201d (the Stoic approach)\nand that in which he is supposed to look at them as part of\n\u201cone\u2019s goods\u201d (the Christian attitude). Even more\ndifferent, however, is to interpret calamities as useful and\nproductive means of experience, as suggested by Cardano. Otherwise, to\npraise the ills of life remains a futile rhetorical exercise, and for\nthis reason Cardano does not hesitate to place Erasmus\u2019 Laus\nstultitiae (\u201cPraise of Folly\u201d) in this category of\nedifying but useless rhetoric. With the exception of irreparable\nlosses, which can only be assuaged by resorting to a whole range of\nconsolatory techniques, Cardano maintains that any other ill can\nalways be turned into something useful and therefore no consolation is\nneeded. To sum up, he identifies different levels \u2013 rhetorical,\ncognitive, and pragmatic \u2013 within the domain of moral\nphilosophy: \u201cTo praise adversities is the eloquent\nrhetorician\u2019s task; to bear them with fortitude belongs to a\ngenerous soul or a person who knows divine truths; to draw useful\ninstruction from them is the mark of a prudent man\u201d (De\nutilitate, OO, II, 11a).\n\nAs in the case of intellectual happiness, relief from emergencies is\npredicated on knowledge. Cardano characterizes his method\n(ratio) for avoiding misfortunes and preparing against\ncalamities as based on a particular kind of knowledge\n(scientia) \u2013 both useful and necessary \u2013 which\n\u201cteaches us to recognize and obtain known goods, and once they\nare obtained, it tells us how to use them and how to protect us with\nthem against ills\u201d (De utilitate, OO, II, 17a). The\nambivalent role of animus in Cardano\u2019s moral philosophy\nis particularly evident in his directions on how to draw profit from\nmisfortunes, for both misery and happiness depend on awareness\n(\u201cthe fact that we know our condition\u201d) (De\nutilitate, OO, II, 88b). Our thinking activity is a key element\nin turning adversities into opportunities of growth in self-awareness.\nAny philosophical discussion of ethical matters presupposes that the\nethical subject is aware of his or her happiness or unhappiness:\n\u201cthe mind (animus) alone is the one who is happy or\nunhappy.\u201d We have previously noted how closely Cardano\u2019s\nnotion of the summum bonum is connected to the principle of\nsoul\u2019s awareness. In the same way, all forms of external goods\n(riches, physical beauty, health, friends, offspring, country, honors)\nare no part of happiness unless they are related to the mind\n(quatenus ad animum referuntur).\n\nThe principal resources through which human beings may learn to draw\nadvantages from adversities are fortitude, prudence, worldly knowledge\n(rerum experientia), and all sorts of helps\n(auxilia), such as material means, friends, authority, bodily\nstrength and practical experience (exercitatio) (De\nutilitate, OO, II, 12a). Among the resources provided by reason,\nCardano shares with Seneca the belief that meditating about\none\u2019s death (meditatio mortis) can trigger active and\npointed responses to everyday problems: \u201calthough death is a\nnecessary event, nevertheless, it contains in an eminent way, so to\nsay, all the reasons that sadden our life.\u201d Thinking about\ndeath, regardless of whether people may be sure that they are going to\nsurvive after death, \u201ccan dissolve almost any form of\nsorrow\u201d (De utilitate, OO, II, 17b). When methodically\nstructured, far from producing anxiety, the thought of death and of\nthe transient nature of all human affairs injects a sense of purpose\nand order into our existence, making us gradually adjusted to a\nuniverse in a constant flux. Cardano\u2019s method of drawing profit\nfrom adversities is based on the general principle that everything in\nnature is subject to incessant change: \u201cI usually compare human\naffairs, this whole sublunary frame (machina sublunaris) and\nall that happens in it to a mass of wax in which, while it is\ncompressed, protrusions become cavities and cavities protrude, all\nforms change, and now they change into similar ones, now into\ndissimilar ones, into charming or foul, horrible and pleasant\nones.\u201d The principle of the unremitting transformation of\nreality (vicissitudo rerum) is therefore the ontological\nrationale behind our belief that ills can be turned into goods (De\nutilitate, OO, II, 14b). Closely related to this principle is\nCardano\u2019s striking assumption that, when considered from the\npoint of view of happiness, all things are on a par (omnia\naequalia sunt): \u201cGod levelled the conditions not only for\nall human beings, but also for all things which are under the\nsky\u201d (De utilitate, OO, II, 18a, 24b).\n\nIt is while examining the essence of humane misfortune that Cardano\nreaches the important conclusion that loss and want are the ultimate\ncauses of one\u2019s hardships. The ability to anticipate and feel in\nadvance the effect of losing something or someone (sensus\namissionis) can therefore prepare us to face calamities in our\nlife (De utilitate, OO, II, 7). While Cardano insists that\nexperience of adversities in life (sensus calamitatum)\nprovides people with a richer sense of their happiness, however, he is\nalso well aware that there are limits in the human ability to process\nmisfortunes into material for inner transformation (De\nutilitate, OO, II, 38b). Material destitution is certainly one of\nthese limits. Among the circumstances that affect our perception of\nwant, penury prevents us from focusing on the improvement of our\nknowledge and level of awareness. When in his division of the goods\n(of the mind, of the body and of fortune) Cardano describes material\nmeans as a pre-condition for the exercise of virtue and happiness, he\ntakes special care in specifying that the ethical inconvenience in\nbeing poor does not lie in not having access to the advantages of\nmaterial prosperity, but in the inability to work towards one\u2019s\nown happiness: \u201cif someone does not have the means to raise his\nchildren, to look for wisdom or to practice justice, he will certainly\nbe unhappy, not because he is poor, but because he cannot practice the\nworks of happiness\u201d (De utilitate, OO, II, 26a). Mental\npain is another situation in which human ability to turn misfortunes\ninto positive experiences is tested to the limit. The way Cardano\ninsists on the severe reality of mental pain (molestia animi,\ndolor animi) is one of the most characteristic aspects of his\nmoral philosophy: \u201cNo disease, if there is not fear of death,\ncan equal mental pain (dolor animi)\u201d (De\nutilitate, OO, II, 18a).\n\nIn promoting (whenever possible) the value of happiness in all\ncircumstances of human life, Cardano does not intend to humour any\nhuman tendency to self-delusion. On the contrary, he sees his effort\nto dispel false beliefs and to curb proclivities to self-deception as\nhis main contribution to moral philosophy, for there is no greater\nmerit than \u201cto free mankind from false opinions\u201d (De\nutilitate, OO, II, 26a). Indeed, sometimes he goes so far as to\ncriticize Averroes\u2019 notion of mental happiness as a form of\nentertaining false hopes (in this case, the hope to achieve\nintellectual bliss). Cardano thinks that the principal task of a moral\nphilosopher should be that of freeing the mind from misapprehensions\nand prejudices: \u201cThere are many people who prefer to be happy in\na mistaken way rather than acknowledge the reality of their affairs\nand their condition\u201d (De utilitate, OO, II, 24b). As\nalready said, mental securitas cannot be premised on forms of\nself-distraction and self-delusion, which turn our mind away from the\ncauses of our discontent. A good physician would never try to assuage\nthe pain of the patient by recommending him to buy \u201cpaintings\nand precious stones\u201d (Theonoston, OO, II, 307a).\nCardano\u2019s method of drawing profit from adversities is therefore\nan attempt to promote endurance while insisting on a courageous\nacceptance of the human condition.\n\nThe clash between appearance and reality, which represents the\nhallmark of Cardano\u2019s ontology and theory of knowledge, has\ntherefore its obvious counterpart in his moral philosophy, where he\noften associates human misery with unrealistic ambitions triggered by\nhuman desires: \u201cSince human nature is driven to the infinite by\nappetites, it can never be satisfied, for it cannot contain the\ninfinite, indeed, not even a great part of what it desires.\u201d\nTherefore, he who is not capable of restraining his own appetites, be\nhe the greatest of the kings, will certainly be the unhappiest person\n(De utilitate, OO, II, 5; De sapientia, OO, I, 532a,\n544b\u2013545a; ed. Bracali, 135, 174\u2013175). To fight our\npropensity to cherish illusory dreams of happiness (somnium\numbrae and umbra somnii), Cardano recommends us to\nbecome more aware of the precarious nature of the human condition\n(humana fragilitas) and to increase our level of\nself-mastery. The combined action of self-knowledge (nosce te\nipsum) and self-control (impera te ipsum) contributes to\nnarrow the otherwise unmanageable scope of our desires\n(Theonoston, OO, II, 310b; De consolatione, OO, I,\n615a; De utilitate, OO, II, 89b-90a). Self-awareness and\nself-control contribute to create positive habits (mores) out\nof actions and passions. Unlike nonhuman animals (belluae),\nhuman beings are capable of disciplining themselves (imperare\nsibiipsis) and to shape their nature (et naturam et mores\nsibi formare) (Paralipomena, OO, X, 448a). They modify\ntheir behavior through thought (cogitatio), language\n(sermo), and action (actio). Actions are primarily\ndirected to what is useful for us and are ruled by the criterion of\ninterest (utile), by pleasure, nature, and habit. Thought\nconcentrates on what is either useful or harmful for us. Language\nadjusts our actions and thought to the variable circumstances that\npresent themselves from time to time (De utilitate, OO, II,\n19a, 20b; De minimis, I, 693a). Once we manage to strike a\nbalance between the scope of our desires and the reality in which we\nlive, two things become most necessary (maxime necessaria):\nto obtain what we wish to have (habere quod velis) and to\nknow how to use what we have (his quae habes uti commode\nscire) (De utilitate, OO, II, 1). To facilitate this\ntask, Cardano distinguishes between disciplines in which the\ntheoretical aspect is more prevalent (such as geometry and theology),\ndisciplines which are characterized by a balanced interplay of theory\n(scientia) and practice (usus), such as medicine and\nlaw, and finally disciplines in which practice (exercitatio)\nis essential, like moral philosophy. Cardano enumerates five\nrequisites that define the nature of an accomplished action (in terms\nof attaining the right means for the right end (adeptio),\nreadiness of execution (promptitudo), and completion\n(perfectio)). These requisites are nature, art, diligence,\npractice, and familiarity with the experts in the field (De\nutilitate, OO, II, 1\u20132; De sapientia, OO, I, 494b;\ned. Bracali, 15).\n5. Divination, Fate, and the Roman Inquisition\n\nAmong the most difficult periods of Cardano\u2019s tumultuous life\nwas his imprisonment and trial by the Inquisition. The episode is\nimportant for a number of reasons. The Roman Inquisition had taken its\nmodern form as a Counter-Reformation apparatus for doctrinal purity in\n1542. Cardano was arguably the most significant Catholic intellectual\ntargeted until Giordano Bruno in the 1590s and Galileo in the\nseventeenth century. His ordeal, then, is a key moment in the history\nof early modern censorship. Beyond that, censor reports reveal a\nnumber of themes central to Cardano\u2019s divinatory and\nastrological thought, even if they distort his actual views. Such\nthemes are essential to the whole of his philosophy and to an\nunderstanding of his general reception as one of the most influential\nastrologers of his time.\n\nThe Inquisition began to investigate Cardano in the spring and summer\nof 1570. On 6 October of that year, he was arrested and imprisoned by\nthe Inquisitor of Bologna, where he lived and was a professor of\nmedicine at the city\u2019s university. Among the documents preserved\nin the Inquisition archives is Cardano\u2019s desperate plea for\nrelease from prison, addressed to the dean of the Inquisition in Rome:\n\u201cToday is the forty-third day in prison [\u2026] I eat almost\nnothing because eating would drive me mad, not eating would drive me\nto death, which I consider the lesser evil\u201d (Baldini and Spruit,\nt. II, 1075). In December, he was transferred to house arrest, and,\nshortly thereafter, in February 1571, the Roman authorities rendered\ntheir judgment: he would abjure not as a formal heretic, but rather as\nvehemently suspected of heresy. Roughly sixty years later, Galileo\nwould be forced to do the same. Unlike Galileo, Cardano was released\nfrom house arrest soon after his abjuration, but he did not escape\nwithout consequences, having lost his professorship due to pressure\nfrom the Inquisition on the Bolognese government. In October, he\nrelocated to Rome. The following year, his non-medical works were\nforbidden by the Index of Prohibited Books. Censors both of the\nInquisition and the Index continued to produce reports on his\npublished writings until at least the 1590s, a testament to the\nenduring interest for him on the Italian peninsula well into the\nseventeenth century. Physicians, lawyers, ecclesiastics, and other\ninterested parties, frequently sought permission from the Church to\nread his banned works (Marcus 2020, 160\u2013163).\n\nGiven Cardano\u2019s heterodox views, the general freedom with which\nhe expressed himself, and his devotion to astrology, it is perhaps\nsurprising that he was not targeted earlier in his career. There is\nlittle doubt that his patrons and renown had provided some protection.\nThe Inquisitor of Bologna, notable for his zealous prosecution of\nheretics, even expressed a measure of concern about dealing with an\nauthor of Cardano\u2019s celebrity. Yet it also seems that Cardano,\ndespite his international fame, lived a somewhat solitary life in\nBologna, bereft of protectors capable of shielding him from local\nmachinations (Regier 2019). Larger forces were also at work. With the\nconclusion of the Council of Trent (1545\u20131563), the Church had\nbecome ever more intolerant of heterodox philosophies. Until the\nInquisition\u2019s archives were opened up in the 1990s, the\nconsensus among historians had been that Cardano had offended the\nChurch by printing a horoscope of Christ in his commentary on\nPtolemy\u2019s Tetrabiblos. The archival documents provide a\nfuller story. It was not Christ\u2019s horoscope that led directly to\nCardano\u2019s trial but rather his De rerum varietate\n(1557), an encyclopedic treatise of natural history. Nevertheless,\nastrology was at the center of the Inquisition\u2019s case from the\nbeginning. For the Inquisition to launch an investigation, an initial\naccusation was needed, and here it had come in the form of a letter\nfrom the Inquisitor of Como. A focal point of the letter\u2019s\nattention was a chapter of the De rerum varietate devoted to\nthe effects of the celestial bodies. According to the Inquisitor,\nCardano \u201cexaggerates\u201d the influence of celestial bodies\nand denies the possibility of God acting directly on sublunar nature.\nHe also, says the Inquisitor, holds the martyrs of the Church to be\nnothing more than madmen, driven to extreme and foolish religious\nbehavior by celestial influence. The Inquisitor also lists, rather\nvaguely, other offenses: contempt of clergy, denial of miracles and\ndemons, and teaching of divinatory superstitions (Baldini and Spruit,\nt. II, 1042\u20131043). This cluster of accusations, with astrology\nat the center, would prove to be the basis for subsequent censorship\nof Cardano. At the heart of censorial concerns was the accusation that\nhe naturalized what the Church believed outside the realm of nature:\nGod and providence, free will, and miracles. Hence, Cardano was not\ntargeted as an astrologer per se, but rather as an\nastrologizing philosopher in the vein of Pietro Pomponazzi\n(1462\u20131525). Censors seemed ready to impute to him the\nskepticism of miracles associated with Pomponazzi, and especially the\nlatter\u2019s embrace of determinism. Pomponazzi had laid out the\npossibility in his De fato, de libero arbitrio, praedestinatione,\nprovidentia Dei (1567) that free will was philosophically\nuntenable, that it could not be reconciled with God\u2019s nature\nunless we limited divine omnipotence and omniscience, and that it\ncould not be reconciled with the Aristotelian causality.\n\nWhile censor reports highlight themes in Cardano\u2019s thought that\nwere important at least to a subset of readers, they are of course\nneither balanced nor accurate portrayals (for more on Cardano\u2019s\ntrial and censorship, see Valente 2003 and 2017; Regier 2019 and\n2021). We might say that his works on divination endorse the consensus\nopinion among Christian astrologers, both medieval and Renaissance,\nthat celestial bodies act as instruments of providence, but that\nhumans can resist natural forces up to a point. He is something of a\nmoderate libertarian: free will exists, but it operates within a field\nof natural, social, and providential constraints. Following a long\ntradition with its origin in Boethius, he seems to recognize a fine\ndistinction between providence and fate: providence is the universal\norder experienced in the timeless present of God\u2019s mind, while\nfate is the manifestation of that order in the universe itself (De\narcanis aeternitatis, OO, X, 43a; Paralipomenon, OO, X,\n468b). Early in his career, he wrote a treatise specifically devoted\nto fate, De fato, which was subsequently lost, likely\ndestroyed by Cardano himself due to fears of the Inquisition (Cardano\n2004a, 53). We can, however, consult De fato\u2019s table of\ncontents, which survives in editions of De libris propriis\n(De libris propriis, OO, I, 62a-63b and 99a-100a; Cardano\n2004, 174\u2013177 and 236\u2013239). These chapter headings raise more\nquestions than they answer, however. Cardano built a sweeping\nargument, it seems, in favor of an all-encompassing fate that subsumed\neven accidental events. And, like Pomponazzi, he was ready to justify\nsuch a conception of fate as a dual consequence of God\u2019s nature\nand the nature of causality. At the same time, however, he devoted a\nchapter to the \u201cutility\u201d of free will.\n\nHow exactly free will was grounded in the lost De fato\nremains a mystery, as does Cardano\u2019s reference to its utility.\nHis writings on divination can help to answer the question, since\nthere he endeavors at moments to clarify the relationship between fate\nand free will. Indeed, an entire section of the De fato was\nto deal with divination, whose viability, according to a chapter\nheading, was based on the orderly unfolding of fate. In his commentary\non Ptolemy\u2019s Tetrabiblos, as in the\nTetrabiblos itself, medicine serves as the paradigm case for\ndivination. In Tetrabiblos I.3, Ptolemy compares astrology to\nmedicine: a physician identifies the course that nature will take if\nleft alone and then employs counteracting forces to bring about\nanother outcome; the astrologer does much the same. Commenting on this\nsection, Cardano agrees with the Arabic mathematician and astrologer\nAli ibn Ridwan (\u201cHaly\u201d in Latin) that Ptolemy here\n\u201cdemonstrated maximum wisdom in things divine and human\u201d\n(De astrorum iudiciis, OO, V, 112a). What Cardano means is\nthat astrology can estimate the force of future conditions, and so can\ndetermine which events can be deflected (declinari possint)\nand which will take place due to the divinely instituted\n\u201cnecessity of fate\u201d (fatali necessitate) (De\nastrorum iudiciis, OO, V, 112b). He has in mind inflection points\nin the providential design of history\u2014wars, great defeats and\nvictories, catastrophes, and political transformations. Yet even under\nthese circumstances, we are not completely powerless. Cardano turns to\nthe analogy of shipwreck to make his point: \u201cIt is as if a\nperson found himself in the sea during a tempest, and although he\nforesaw the danger he could not avoid it. The person skilled in\nswimming through heavy currents or practiced in handling the danger\nwill be saved, while another hardly so. The divine can be considered\nsimilarly, because it is entirely necessary, and because whatever is\naccomplished by the divine mind cannot be escaped\u201d (De\nastrorum iudiciis, OO, V, 112b). Prognostication in this sense\nalways implies an estimation of forces, followed by a consideration of\nthe appropriate response. Cardano proffers a two-tiered astrological\nsystem where princes of the world are more subject to astrological\neffects than their subjects; through astrological changes, the divine\ncan effectively seize the hearts of kings and steer history to its\ndetermined end. This is not to say that the individual outside the\nranks of power never experiences moments of unavoidable fate. In\nDe libris propriis, Cardano reflects on the signs that\nforetold his eldest son\u2019s execution, signs whose meaning only\nbecame clear when it was too late. Cardano asks himself why these\nsigns presented themselves when they were to be of no use. He\nconcludes that they function as Christian consolation, as proof of\nGod\u2019s existence, providential design, and so of the justice that\nreveals itself in the unfolding of history (De libris\npropriis, OO, I, 98a-b; Maclean 2004, 234-235).\n\nAcross a spectrum of works, Cardano depicts the course of a human life\nas the result of a dynamic between outward and inward inclinations,\nand the knowledge and force that we can muster to counter or\ncomplement them. Yet we are not dealing with a pure form of naturalism\nhere. The divine and supernatural, as Cardano understands them, are\nconstantly speaking about the future to humans through intermediaries,\nthrough nature itself (Regier 2023). In his monumental treatise on\ndream interpretation, Somniorum Synesiorum libri IV or De\nsomniis, he describes a universe where providential knowledge is\nrelayed from God to the celestial intelligences, then to humans. He\nwrites that when we sleep, we enter into a communion with God\u2019s\nmind, such that the future is entirely presented to our souls, but we\nrarely perceive the information due to the effects of bodily\nimbalance, daily worries, and general overstimulation. We are like\ndogs given food by their master; we are oblivious to the preparation\nthat went into it, to its significance (De somniis, OO, V,\n672a; Cardano 2021a, 515). The framework here is generally\nNeoplatonic: the soul has tremendous access to knowledge that stands\nabove the sensory realm, yet it is too bogged down by incorporeal\nthings\u2014indeed, one of the intellectual benefits of melancholy,\nto which Cardano assigns a variety of powerful effects, is that it can\ndistance the mind from daily and corporeal cares. As for the nature of\ndreams, the celestial influence uses our memories as if they were\nstones in a mosaic, assembling these memories into a composite with\nmeaning; for this reason, dreams are usually cryptic (De\nsomniis, OO, V, 598b; Cardano 2021a, 43).\n\nExcept in very rare cases (e.g., the dreams of perfect clarity that\nCardano calls idola), the future must be deciphered with\nimperfect results. The underlying cause is the nature of the infinite.\nSciences that concern the future, he writes, all run up against the\nsame problem, the \u201cinfinite nature of things, that is, of the\nsoul and of what can be seen; that which sees and that which can be\nseen are infinite in number. How then can the infinite be contained in\nbooks, however long and numerous?\u201d (De somniis, OO, V,\n671a; Cardano 2021a, 513). He warns his readers against philosophers\nlike Cicero who prefer clarity to nuance. Clarity is a rhetorical\ncheat; only the greatest of philosophers appreciate infinity and\nrecognize that clarity is the nemesis of accuracy. This discussion is\nmeant to explain the difficulty of dream interpretation, but it could\nbe extended to any other discipline. Knowledge and ignorance interact\nat the level of the cosmos, insofar as created beings cannot fully\nunderstand the providential knowledge that flows through them and\nmanifests in their actions. Galen, says Cardano, does not know how he\nmoves his finger back and forth, despite all his anatomical knowledge,\nbut he can do it anyway because of the natural framework divinely\nestablished. The celestial intelligences possess detailed knowledge of\ntheir influence over the sublunar world, yet they neither understand\nhow they received this knowledge from God, nor do they know how they\nreally move that world any more than Galen knows how he moves his\nfinger (De somniis, OO, V, 671b-672a; Cardano 2021a, 515).\nNature, in this way, is infused with knowledge\u2014knowledge of all\nthat has and will happen; yet even at the highest ontological level,\nsuch knowledge is accompanied by the ignorance of created beings in\nrelation to divine understanding.\n",
