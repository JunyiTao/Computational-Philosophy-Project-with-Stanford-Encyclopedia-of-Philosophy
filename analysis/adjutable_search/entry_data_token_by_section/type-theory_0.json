    "main_text": "Paradoxes and Russell\u2019s Type Theories\n1. Paradoxes and Russell\u2019s Type Theories\n\n\nThe theory of types was introduced by Russell in order to cope with\nsome contradictions he found in his account of set theory and was\nintroduced in \u201cAppendix B: The Doctrine of Types\u201d\nof Russell 1903. This contradiction was obtained by analysing a\ntheorem of Cantor that no mapping\n\n\\[\nF:X \\rightarrow \\Pow(X)\n\\]\n\n\n\n(where \\(\\Pow(X)\\) is the class of subclasses of a class\n\\(X)\\) can be surjective; that is, \\(F\\) cannot be such that\nevery member \\(b\\) of \\(\\Pow(X)\\) is equal to\n\\(F(a)\\) for some element \\(a\\) of \\(X\\). This\ncan be phrased \u201cintuitively\u201d as the fact that there are\nmore subsets of \\(X\\) than elements of \\(X\\). The proof of\nthis fact is so simple and basic that it is worthwhile giving it\nhere. Consider the following subset of \\(X\\):\n\n\\[\nA = \\{ x \\in X \\mid x \\not\\in F(x)\\}.\n\\]\n\n\n\nThis subset cannot be in the range of \\(F\\). For if \\(A = F(a)\\), for\nsome \\(a\\), then \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\na \\in F(a) &\\text{ iff } a \\in A \\\\\n &\\text{ iff } a \\not\\in F(a)\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n\nwhich is a contradiction. \n\n\nSome remarks are in order. First, the proof\ndoes not use the law of excluded middle and is thus valid\nintuitionistically. Second, the method that is used, called\ndiagonalisation was already present in the work of du\nBois-Reymond for building real functions growing faster than any\nfunction in a given sequence of functions. \n\n\nRussell analysed what happens if we apply this theorem to the case\nwhere A is the class of all classes, admitting that there is such a\nclass. He was then lead to consider the special class of classes that\ndo not belong to themselves\n\n\\[\\tag{*}\nR = \\{ w \\mid w \\not\\in w \\}.\n\\]\n\n\n\nWe then have\n\n\\[\nR \\in R \\text{ iff } R \\not\\in R.\n\\]\n\n\n\nIt seems indeed that Cantor was already aware of the fact that the\nclass of all sets cannot be considered itself to be a set.\n\n\nRussell communicated this problem to Frege, and his letter, together\nwith Frege\u2019s answer appear in van Heijenoort 1967. It is important\nto realise that the formulation (*) does not apply as it is to Frege\u2019s\nsystem. As Frege himself wrote in his reply to Russell, the expression\n\u201ca predicate is predicated of itself\u201d is not exact. Frege\nhad a distinction between predicates (concepts) and\nobjects. A (first-order) predicate applies to an object but\nit cannot have a predicate as argument. The exact formulation of the\nparadox in Frege\u2019s system uses the notion of the extension of\na predicate \\(P\\), which we designate as \\(\\varepsilon P\\).\nThe extension of a predicate is itself an object. The important axiom\nV is:\n\n\\[\\tag{Axiom V}\n\\varepsilon P = \\varepsilon Q \\equiv \\forall x [P(x) \\equiv Q(x)]\n\\]\n\n\n\nThis axiom asserts that the extension of \\(P\\) is identical to the\nextension of \\(Q\\) if and only if \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) are materially\nequivalent. We can then translate Russell\u2019s paradox (*) in\nFrege\u2019s system by defining the predicate\n\n\\[\nR(x) \\text{ iff } \\exists P[x = \\varepsilon P \\wedge \\neg P(x)]\n\\]\n\n\n\nIt can then been checked, using Axiom V in a crucial way, that \n\n\\[\nR(\\varepsilon R) \\equiv \\neg R(\\varepsilon R)\n\\]\n\n\n\nand we have a contradiction as well. (Notice that for defining the\npredicate \\(R\\), we have used an impredicative\nexistential quantification on predicates. It can be shown that the\npredicative version of Frege\u2019s system is consistent (see\nHeck 1996 and for further refinements Ferreira 2002).\n\n\nIt is clear from this account that an idea of types was already\npresent in Frege\u2019s work: there we find a distinction between objects,\npredicates (or concepts), predicates of predicates, etc. (This point\nis stressed in Quine 1940.) This hierarchy is called the\n\u201cextensional hierarchy\u201d by Russell (1959), and its\nnecessity was recognised by Russell as a consequence of his\nparadox.\n",
