    "main_text": "The conceptual issue\n1. The conceptual issue\n\nThe history of terrorism is probably coextensive with the history of\npolitical violence. The term \u201cterrorism\u201d, however, is\nrelatively recent: it has been in use since late 18th century. Its use\nhas repeatedly shifted in some significant respects. Moreover, in\ncontemporary political discourse the word is often employed as a\npolemical term whose strong emotional charge occludes its somewhat\nvague descriptive meaning. All this tends to get in the way of\nsustained rational discussion of the nature and moral standing of\nterrorism and the best ways of coping with it.\n",
