    "main_text": "Philosophy of Evolutionary Biology\n3. Philosophy of Evolutionary Biology\n\nPhilosophy of biology can also be subdivided by the particular areas\nof biology with which it is concerned. Until recently, evolutionary\nbiology has attracted the lion\u2019s share of philosophical attention.\nThis work has sometimes been designed to support a general thesis in\nthe philosophy of science, such as the \u201csemantic view\u201d or\nmodel-based view of theories (Beatty 1980; Lloyd 1988; Thompson 1988).\nBut most of this work is concerned with conceptual problems that arise\ninside the theory itself, and the work often resembles theoretical\nbiology as much as pure philosophy of science. For example, Elliott\nSober\u2019s classic study The Nature of Selection: Evolutionary Theory\nin Philosophical Focus (Sober 1984b) marks the point at which\nmany philosophers became aware of the philosophy of biology. Sober\nanalyzed the structure of population genetics via an analogy with\nNewtonian mechanics and the composition of forces, treating the actual\nchange in gene frequencies over time as the result of several\ndifferent \u201cforces\u201d, such as selection, random genetic\ndrift, mutation, and migration. Several philosophers of biology have\nchallenged this interpretation of evolutionary theory in favor of a\n\u201cstatistical\u201d approach (Sterelny & Kitcher 1988;\nMatthen and Ariew 2002; Walsh, Lewens, and Ariew 2002), and this\ndebate continues. Another instance of a conceptual problem in\nevolutionary theory concerns the nature of random genetic drift. How\nare selection and drift distinct (Beatty 1987)? We typically think of\ndrift occurring when there is random fluctuation of gene frequencies,\nbut selection in a changing environment can produce the very same\npattern. Thus, some philosophers of biology have argued we must\ndistinguish selection and drift as processes rather than just as\npatterns. One way to do this is through a distinction between\nindiscriminate and discriminate sampling processes (Millstein 2002;\nBrandon 2005; Millstein 2005). The question becomes whether the trait\nof interest is causally irrelevant or relevant to changes in gene\nfrequencies. These examples of careful, methodological analysis of\npopulation genetics, the mathematical core of traditional evolutionary\ntheory, continue to give rise to interesting results (Pigliucci and\nKaplan 2006; Plutynski 2006; Okasha 2007; Sarkar 2011).\n\nThe intense philosophical interest in evolutionary theory in the\n1980\u2019s can partly be explained by two controversies\n(Segerstr\u00e5le 2000). First, there was a controversy over\n\u201csociobiology\u201d that was provoked by the publications of\nE.O. Wilson\u2019s eponymous textbook (Wilson 1975) and his Pulitzer\nprize winning popular book (Wilson 1978). One extremely important\ncritique of this application of evolutionary biology to human social\nbehavior came from Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Lewontin (Gould and\nLewontin 1979). The debates over adaptationism turned out to involve a\ndiffuse set of worries about whether evolution produces adaptations,\nthe role of optimality models, and the methodology of evolutionary\ntheory (Amundson 1994; Orzack and Sober 1994; Brandon and Rausher\n1996; Godfrey-Smith 2001; Millstein 2007; Forber 2009; Potochnik 2009;\nLloyd 2015). Philosophical work has helped to distinguish these\nstrands in the debate and reduce the confusion seen in the heated and\npolemical biological literature for and against adaptationism (Orzack\nand Sober 2001). Second, there was the appearance of George\nWilliams\u2019 Adaptation and Natural Selection (Williams\n1966) and Richard Dawkins\u2019 The Selfish Gene (Dawkins\n1976). They claim that the unit of selection is the individual\nMendelian allele rather than the organism, group of organisms, or\nspecies. This created an explosion of early philosophical work on the\n\u201cunits of selection\u201d question (Brandon and Burian 1984).\nThe early debates concerned whether there was a determinate unit of\nselection and what criteria should be used for determining what it is\nin a given case (Hull 1980; Wimsatt 1980a, 1980b; Brandon 1982; Sober\n& Lewontin 1984; Lloyd 1988; Sterelny & Kitcher 1988). As\nmulti-level selection models and the Price equation appeared, close\nattention turned to how those models should be interpreted\n(Godfrey-Smith & Lewontin 1993; Godfrey-Smith & Kerr 2002;\nLloyd 2005; Waters 2005; Okasha 2006; Birch 2017). For example, for\nany group selection model, is there an empirically equivalent\nindividual selection model (similarly for genotypic and genic models)?\nIf so, do they represent the very same causal structure? Is kin\nselection a form of group selection? Arguably, philosophers made a\nsignificant contribution to the rehabilitation of some forms of\n\u201cgroup selection\u201d within evolutionary biology in the\n1990s, following two decades of neglect or contempt (Sober and Wilson\n1998).\n",
