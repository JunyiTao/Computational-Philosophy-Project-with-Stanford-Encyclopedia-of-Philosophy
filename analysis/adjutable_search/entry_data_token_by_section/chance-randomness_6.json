    "main_text": "Randomness || Schnorr\u2019s theorem: Kolmogorov and ML-randomness coincide\n2.3 Schnorr\u2019s theorem: Kolmogorov and ML-randomness coincide\n\n\nBoth plain and prefix-free Kolmogorov randomness provide\nsatisfactory accounts of the randomness of finite sequences. One\ndifficulty arises, as I suggested earlier, when we attempt to extend\nplain Kolmogorov randomness to the case of infinite sequences in the\nmost obvious way, that is, by defining an infinite sequence as\nKolmogorov random iff all finite initial segments are Kolmogorov\nrandom. It would then turn out that no infinite sequence is random.\nWhy? Because of the following theorem, which shows that there is no\nsequence such that all of its initial segments are random:\n\n\nTheorem 6 (Martin-L\u00f6f\n 1966). For any sufficiently long string, there will always \nbe some fairly compressible initial segments. (See also Li and Vit\u00e1nyi 2008:\n\u00a72.5.1 and Downey and\nHirschfeldt 2010: \u00a72.1.)\n\n\n [Proof]\n\n\nThis dip in complexity of an initial subsequence will occur infinitely\noften in even a random infinite sequence, a phenomenon known\nas complexity oscillation (Li and Vit\u00e1nyi 2008:\n\u00a72.5.1). This phenomenon means that \u2018it is difficult to\nexpress a universal sequential test precisely in terms\nof \\(C\\)-complexity\u2019 (Li and Vit\u00e1nyi 2008: 151), and\nthe best that can be precisely done is to find upper and lower bounds\nexpressible in terms of ordinary Kolmogorov complexity between which\nthe set of ML-random sequences falls (Li and Vit\u00e1nyi 2008:\n\u00a7 2.5.3). \n\n\nHowever, the phenomenon of complexity oscillation does not pose as\nsignificant a problem for prefix-free Kolmogorov\ncomplexity. Complexity oscillation does arise, but in fact the\ninefficiency of prefix-free encodings is a benefit here:\n\u2018\\(K\\) exceeds \\(C\\) by so much that the complexity of\nthe prefix does not drop below the length of the prefix itself (for\nrandom infinite \\(\\omega)\\)\u2019 (Li and Vit\u00e1nyi 2008:\n221). That is, while the complexity of some initial segments dips\ndown, it always remains greater than the length of the prefix. So it\ncan be that, uniformly, when \\(x\\) is an infinite sequence, for\nany of its initial subsequences \\(\\sigma , K(\\sigma) \\ge \n\\lvert\\sigma\\rvert\\). This suggests that we can extend prefix-free Kolmogorov\ncomplexity to the infinite case in the straightforward way: an\ninfinite sequence \\(x\\) is prefix-free Kolmogorov random iff\nevery finite initial subsequence is prefix-free Kolmogorov random.\n\n\nWith this definition in hand we obtain a very striking result. The\nclass of infinite prefix-free Kolmogorov random sequences is certainly\nnon-empty. Indeed: it is just the class of ML-random sequences!\n\n\nTheorem 7 (Schnorr). A sequence \n is ML-random iff it is prefix-free Kolmogorov random. \n\n\n [Proof]\n\n\nSchnorr\u2019s theorem is evidence that we really have captured the\nintuitive notion of randomness. Different intuitive starting points\nhave generated the same set of random sequences. This has been taken\nto be evidence that ML-randomness or equivalently (prefix-free)\nKolmogorov randomness is really the intuitive notion of randomness, in\nmuch the same way as the coincidence of Turing machines, Post\nmachines, and recursive functions was taken to be evidence\nfor Church\u2019s Thesis, the claim that any one of these notions\ncaptures the intuitive notion of effective computability. Accordingly,\nDelahaye (1993) has proposed the Martin-L\u00f6f-Chaitin\nThesis, that either of these definitions captures the intuitive\nnotion of randomness. If this thesis is true, this undermines at least\nsome sceptical contentions about randomness, such as the claim of\nHowson and Urbach (1993: 324) that \u2018it seems highly doubtful\nthat there is anything like a unique notion of randomness there to be\nexplicated\u2019.\n\nThere are some reasons to be suspicious of the Martin-L\u00f6f-Chaitin\nThesis, despite the mathematically elegant convergence between these\ntwo mathematical notions. For one, there is quite a bit of intuitive\nsupport for accounts of randomness which do not make it primarily a\nproperty of sequences, and those other accounts are no less able to be\nmade mathematically rigorous (see especially the\n\u2018epistemic\u2019 theories of randomness discussed in\n\u00a76.2, as well as theories of randomness as\nindeterminism discussed in \u00a77.2). The\nexistence of other intuitive notions makes the case of randomness\nrather unlike the supposedly analogous case of Church\u2019s Thesis, where\nno robust alternative characterisation of effective computability is\navailable. \n Even if we accept that randomness, like disorder, is at root a\nproduct notion, there are a number of candidates in the vicinity of\nthe set identified by Schnorr\u2019s thesis that might also deserve to be\ncalled the set of random sequences. Most obviously, there is Schnorr\u2019s\nown conception of randomness (\u00a72.1.2;\nsupplement B.1.2). Schnorr\n(1971) suggests that, for technical and conceptual reasons, Schnorr\nrandomness is to be preferred to Martin-L\u00f6f randomness as an\naccount of the intuitive notion. While results that parallel the\nconvergence of ML-randomness and Kolmogorov randomness have been given\n(Downey and Griffiths 2004), the relevant compressibility notion of\nrandomness for Schnorr randomness was not known until quite recently,\nand is certainly less intuitively clear than Kolmogorov\nrandomness. Moreover, since the set of ML-random sequences is a strict\nsubset of the set of Schnorr random sequences, any problematic members\nof the former are equally problematic members of the latter; and of\ncourse there will be Schnorr random sequences which fail some\nMartin-L\u00f6f statistical test, which might lead some to reject the\nviability of Schnorr\u2019s notion from the start.\nSchnorr\u2019s result showing the convergence between prefix-free\nKolmogorov complexity and Martin-L\u00f6f randomness is very\nsuggestive. As has become clear, the existence of other notions of\nrandomness\u2014incluing Schnorr randomness, as well as a number of\nother proposals (Li and Vit\u00e1nyi 2008: \u00a72.5; Porter 2016: 464\u20136)\u2014shows that\nwe should be somewhat cautious in yielding to its suggestion. \n\nThis is especially true in light of a recent argument by Porter (2016: 469\u201370). He considers a certain schematic characterisation of computable functions, something like this: for every computable function \\(f\\) with property \\(P_i, f\\) is differentiable at \\(x\\) iff \\(x\\) corresponds to a random\\(_i\\) sequence. It turns out that for each sense of randomness (ML randomness, Schnorr randomness, computable randomness, etc.), there is some corresponding property of computable functions. Most importantly, none of these properties look overwhelmingly more natural or canonical than the others. For example, computable functions of bounded variation are differentiable at the Martin-L\u00f6f random points, while nondecreasing computable functions are differentiable at the computably random points. The difficulty for the Martin-L\u00f6f-Chaitin Thesis is this: these results give us the notion of a typical sequence, with respect to the differentiability of various kinds of function. Unfortunately, these notions of typical sequence diverge from one another. Unlike Church\u2019s thesis, where all the notions of effective computability line up, here we have a case where various notions of a typical sequence do not line up with each other (though there is significant overlap). Porter concludes that \u2018no single definition of randomness can do the work of capturing every mathematically significant collection of typical points\u2019 (Porter 2016: 471). \n\n\nThat conclusion may well be justified. But we can largely sidestep the dispute over whether there is a single precise notion of\nrandomness that answers perfectly to our intuitive conception of\nrandom sequence. Kolmogorov-Martin-L\u00f6f randomness is a reasonable and\nrepresentative exemplar of the algorithmic approach to randomness, and it overlaps almost everywhere with any other plausible definition of randomness. It is adopted here as a useful working account of randomness for\nsequences. None of the difficulties and problems I raise below for the\nconnection between random sequences and chance turns in any material\nway on the details of which particular set of sequences gets counted\nas random (most are to do with the mismatch between the process notion\nof chance and any algorithmic conception of randomness, with\ndifferences amongst the latter being relatively unimportant). So while\nthe observations below are intended to generalise to Schnorr\nrandomness and other proposed definitions of random sequences, I will\nexplicitly treat only KML randomness in what follows.\n",
