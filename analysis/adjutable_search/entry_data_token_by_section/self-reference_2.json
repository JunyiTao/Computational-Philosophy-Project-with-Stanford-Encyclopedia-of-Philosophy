    "main_text": "Paradoxes of Self-Reference || Epistemic paradoxes\n1.3 Epistemic paradoxes\n\nThe most well-know epistemic paradox is the paradox of the\nknower. This paradox has many equivalent formulations, one of\nthem based on the sentence \u201cThis sentence is not known by\nanyone.\u201d Let us call this sentence the knower sentence,\nabbreviated \\(KS. KS\\) is obviously quite similar to the\nliar sentence, except the central concept involved is knowledge rather\nthan truth. The reasoning leading to a contradiction from \\(KS\\)\nis a bit more complex than in the liar paradox. First \\(KS\\) is\nshown to be true by the following piece of reasoning:\n\nAssume to obtain a contradiction that \\(KS\\) is not true. Then\nwhat \\(KS\\) expresses cannot be the case, that is, \\(KS\\)\nmust be known by someone. Since everything known is true (this is part\nof the definition of the concept of knowledge), \\(KS\\) is true,\ncontradicting our assumption. This concludes the proof that\n\\(KS\\) is true.\n\n\nThe piece of reasoning just carried out to prove the truth of\n\\(KS\\) should be available to any agent (person) with sufficient\nreasoning capabilities. That is, an agent should be able to prove the\ntruth of \\(KS\\), and thus come to know that \\(KS\\) holds.\nHowever, if \\(KS\\) is known by someone, then what it expresses is\nnot the case, and thus it cannot be true. This is a contradiction, and\nthus we have a paradox. The role of self-reference in this paradox is\nobvious, as it is based on a sentence, \\(KS\\), referring directly\nto itself.\n\nThe paradox of the knower is just one of many epistemic paradoxes\ninvolving self-reference. See the entry on\n epistemic paradoxes\n for further information on the class of epistemic paradoxes. A quite\nrecent epistemic paradox, cast in the setting of beliefs and\nassumptions in a two-player game, is the Brandenburger-Keisler paradox\n(Brandenburger & Keisler, 2006), described in detail in the entry\non\n epistemic foundations of game theory.\n For a detailed discussion and history of the paradoxes of\nself-reference in general, see the entry on\n paradoxes and contemporary logic.\n \n",
