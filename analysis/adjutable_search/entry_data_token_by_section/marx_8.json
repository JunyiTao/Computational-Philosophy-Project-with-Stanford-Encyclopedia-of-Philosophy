    "main_text": "Alienation and Human Flourishing || Remaining Questions\n2.5 Remaining Questions\n\nEven with these elaborations, many additional questions remain about\nMarx\u2019s account. Three concerns are briefly addressed here.\n\nFirst, one might worry about the place of alienation in the evolution\nof Marx\u2019s thought. The once-popular suggestion that Marx only\nwrote about alienation in his early writings\u2014his published and\nunpublished works from the early 1840s\u2014is not sustained by the\ntextual evidence. However, the theoretical role that the concept of\nalienation plays in his writings might still be said to evolve. For\nexample, it has been suggested that alienation in the early writings\nis intended to play an \u201cexplanatory role\u201d, whereas in his\nlater work it comes to have a more \u201cdescriptive or\ndiagnostic\u201d function (Wood 1981 [2004: 7]).\n\nA second concern is the role of human nature in the interpretation of\nalienation offered here. In one exegetical variant of this worry, the\nsuggestion is that this account of alienation rests on a model of\nuniversal human nature which Marx\u2019s (later) understanding of\nhistorical specificity and change prevents him from endorsing.\nHowever, there is much evidence against this purported later rejection\nof human nature (see Geras 1983). Indeed, the \u201cmature\u201d\nMarx explicitly affirms that human nature has both constant and\nmutable elements; that human beings are characterised by universal\nqualities, constant across history and culture, and variable\nqualities, reflecting historical and cultural diversity (McMurtry\n1978: 19\u201353). One systematic, rather than exegetical, variant of\nthe present worry suggests that we should not endorse accounts of\nalienation which depend on \u201cthick\u201d and inevitably\ncontroversial accounts of human nature (Jaeggi 2016). Whatever view we\ntake of that claim about our endorsement, there seems little doubt\nabout the \u201cthickness\u201d of Marx\u2019s own account of human\nflourishing. To provide for the latter, a society must satisfy not\nonly basic needs (for sustenance, warmth and shelter, certain climatic\nconditions, physical exercise, basic hygiene, procreation and sexual\nactivity), but also less basic needs, both those that are not always\nappreciated to be part of his account (for recreation, culture,\nintellectual stimulation, artistic expression, emotional satisfaction,\nand aesthetic pleasure), and those that Marx is more often associated\nwith (for fulfilling work and meaningful community) (Leopold 2007:\n227\u2013245).\n\nThird, we may ask about Marx\u2019s attitude towards the distinction\nsometimes made between subjective and objective alienation. These two\nforms of alienation can be exemplified separately or conjointly in the\nlives of particular individuals or societies (Hardimon 1994:\n119\u2013122). Alienation is \u201csubjective\u201d when it is\ncharacterised in terms of the presence (or absence) of certain beliefs\nor feelings; for example, when individuals are said to be alienated\nbecause they feel estranged from the world. Alienation is\n\u201cobjective\u201d when it is characterised in terms which make\nno reference to the beliefs or feelings of individuals; for example,\nwhen individuals are said to be alienated because they fail to develop\nand deploy their essential human characteristics, whether or not they\nexperience that lack of self-realisation as a loss. Marx seems to\nallow that these two forms of alienation are conceptually distinct,\nbut assumes that in capitalist societies they are typically found\ntogether. Indeed, he often appears to think of subjective alienation\nas tracking the objective variant. That said, Marx does allow that\nthey can come apart sociologically. At least, that is one way of\nreading a passage in The Holy Family where he recognises that\ncapitalists do not get to engage in self-realising activities of the\nright kind (and hence are objectively alienated), but\nthat\u2014unlike the proletariat\u2014they are content in\ntheir estrangement (and hence are lacking subjective alienation),\nfeeling \u201cat ease\u201d in, and even \u201cstrengthened\u201d\nby, it (MECW 4: 36).\n",
