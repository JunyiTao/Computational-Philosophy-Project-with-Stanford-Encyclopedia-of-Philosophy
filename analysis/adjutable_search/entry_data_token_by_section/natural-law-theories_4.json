And indeed there is no sufficient reason to follow him in\nrestricting the range of practical-theoretical reflection on what is\nneeded for a political society worthy of the self-restraints and\nacceptance of responsibilities that the law requires of those to whom\nit applies. For it is clear that the procedures and institutions of\nlaw are in the service of substantive purposes: the restriction of\nviolence, theft and fraud, the recovery of things misappropriated from\ntheir lawful owners or possessors, and of losses wrongfully imposed,\nprotection of intangible goods such as reputation against unwarranted\ndefamation, and of the immature, the mentally disabled and other\nvulnerable people against sexual or other exploitation, and so forth.\n\n\n\nThat portion of our positive law which consists of legal principles or\nrules giving effect to purposes such as those just listed was often\nnamed, by natural law theories, ius [or jus]\ngentium. Minted by jurists of classical Roman law such as\nGaius (c. 165 AD), this name\u2014literally \u201cthe law of\npeoples\u201d\u2014alludes to the set of rules and principles found\nin similar if not identical forms in virtually all legal systems. The\nreason for their ubiquity is, generally speaking, that any reasonable\nconsideration of what it takes for individuals, families and other\nassociations to live together in political society, tolerably well,\nwill identify these principles and rules as necessary. In modern law\nthey are picked out, in principle, by names such as \u201cthe general\nprinciples of law recognized by civilized nations\u201d (Statute of\nthe International Court of Justice, art. 38), ius\ncogens erga omnes (literally \u201claw that is\ncompelling [obligatory without agreement or enactment or other forms\nof adoption] in relation to [for/on, \u2018against\u2019]\neveryone\u201d), \u201chigher law\u201d, or \u201cfundamental\nhuman rights.\u201d In Aquinas\u2019s theory of law, they are referred to\nas conclusions (entailments) of the very highest-level, most\ngeneral moral principles. In the common law tradition, the legal\nwrongs picked out by such principles have been called mala in\nse, as distinct from mala prohibita\u2014things wrong\nin themselves as distinct from things wrong only because prohibited by\n(positive) law\u2014and this distinction remains, for good reason, in\nuse in judicial reasoning.\n\n\nSome legal theories speak of these principles and rules as belonging\nto law by a kind of \u201cconceptual\u201d necessity. Hart (1961)\ncan be so read. But even Hart\u2019s account, on closer examination,\nidentifies the relevant necessity not as conceptual or linguistic but\nas an instance of the rational necessity of means needed to secure\npurposes which are non-optional. It was for this reason that Hart\nspoke of them as constituting \u201cthe minimum content of natural\nlaw.\u201d He would have expressed his own meaning more perspicuously\nhad he spoken instead of \u201cthe minimum content of positive law,\nthe minimum set of principles which, because rationally necessitated\n\u2014given certain fundamental \u2018truisms\u2019 about human\nnature and the human predicament\u2014for the securing of purposes\nshared by all survivable human societies, can be called natural\nlaw.\u201d The fact is that these elements of our law are both\npositive (made and part of official practice) and natural (rationally\nrequired for at least minimal human flourishing).\n\n                 \nThese issues are discussed further in Section 3 below.\n",
