    "main_text": "\n\nAt the heart of the underdetermination of scientific theory by\nevidence is the simple idea that the evidence available to us at a\ngiven time may be insufficient to determine what beliefs we should\nhold in response to it. In a textbook example, if I know that you\nspent $10 on apples and oranges and that apples cost $1 while oranges\ncost $2, then I know that you did not buy six oranges, but I do not\nknow whether you bought one orange and eight apples, two oranges and\nsix apples, and so on. A simple scientific example can be found in the\nrationale behind the important methodological adage that\n\u201ccorrelation does not imply causation\u201d. If playing violent\nvideo games causes children to be more aggressive in their playground\nbehavior, then we should (barring complications) expect to find a\ncorrelation between time spent playing such video games and aggressive\nbehavior on the playground. But that is also what we would\nexpect to find if children who are prone to aggressive behavior tend\nto enjoy and seek out violent video games more than other children, or\nif propensities for playing violent video games and for aggressive\nplayground behavior are both caused by some third factor (like being\nbullied or general parental neglect). So a high correlation between\ntime spent playing violent video games and aggressive playground\nbehavior (by itself) simply underdetermines what we should\nbelieve about the causal relationship between the two. But it turns\nout that this simple and familiar predicament only scratches the\nsurface of the various ways in which problems of underdetermination\ncan arise in the course of scientific investigation.\n",
