    "main_text": "Substance and Definition\n9. Substance and Definition\n\nIn \u0396.10 and 11, Aristotle returns to the consideration of essence\nand definition left off in \u0396.6, but now within the hylomorphic\ncontext developed in \u0396.7\u20139. The main question these\nchapters consider is whether the definition of x ever\nincludes a reference to the matter of x. If some definitions\ninclude a reference to matter, then the link between essence and form\nwould seem to be weakened.\n\nAristotle begins \u0396.10 by endorsing the following principle about\ndefinitions and their parts: \u201ca definition is an account, and\nevery account has parts, and as the account is to the thing, so the\npart of the account is to the part of the thing\u201d\n(1034b20\u201322). That is, if y is a part of a\ndefinable thing x, then the definition of x will\ninclude as a part something z that corresponds to y.\nIndeed, z must stand to y in the same relation that\nthe definition of x stands in to x; that is,\nz is the definition of y. So, according to this\nprinciple, the definition of a thing will include the definitions of\nits parts.\n\nIn a way, this consequence of the principle seems very plausible,\ngiven Aristotle\u2019s idea that it is universals that are definable\n(\u0396.11, 1036a29). Consider as a definiendum a\nuniversal, such as man, and its definiens, rational\nanimal. The parts of this definiens are the universals\nrational and animal. If these parts are, in turn,\ndefinable, then each should be replaced, in the definition of\nman, with its own definition, and so on. In this way the\ncomplete and adequate definition of a universal such as man\nwill contain no parts that are further definable. All proper, or\ncompletely analyzed, definitions are ultimately composed of simple\nterms that are not further definable.\n\nBut the implication of this idea for the definitions of hylomorphic\ncompounds is obvious: since matter appears to be a part of such a\ncompound, the definition of the compound will include, as a part, the\ndefinitions of its material components. And this consequence seems\nimplausible to Aristotle. A circle, for example, seems to be composed\nof two semicircles (for it obviously may be divided into two\nsemicircles), but the definition of circle cannot be composed\nof the definitions of its two semicircular parts. For, as Aristotle\npoints out (1035b9), semicircle is defined in\nterms of circle, and not the other way around. His point is\nwell taken, for if circles were defined in terms of semicircles, then\npresumably semicircles would be defined in terms of the\nquarter-circles of which they are composed, and so on, ad\ninfinitum. The resulting infinite regress would make it\nimpossible to define circle at all, for one would never reach\nthe ultimate \u201csimple\u201d parts of which such a definition\nwould be composed.\n\nAristotle flirts with the idea of distinguishing between different\nsenses in which one thing can be a part of another\n(1034b33), but instead proposes a different solution: to\nspecify carefully the whole of which the matter is allegedly a part.\n\u201cAnd of the compound statue the bronze is a part, but of what is\nsaid to be a statue as form it is not a part\u201d\n(1035a6). Similarly, \u201ceven if the line, when divided,\npasses away into the halves, or the human into the bones, sinews, and\nflesh, it is not the case that because of this they are composed of\nthese as being parts of the substance\u201d\n(1035a17\u201320). Rather, \u201cwhat is divided into\nthese as into matter is not the substance but the compound\u201d\n(1035b20\u20131).\n\nIn restating his point \u201cyet more perspicuously\u201d\n(1035b4), Aristotle notes parenthetically another important\naspect of his theory of substance. He reiterates the priority of form,\nand its parts, to the matter into which a compound is divided, and\nnotes that \u201cthe soul of animals (for this is substance of the\nanimate) is the substance that is in accord with the account and is\nthe form and the essence\u201d (1035b14\u20135). The idea\nrecurs in \u0396.11, where he announces that \u201cit is clear too\nthat the soul is primary substance, whereas the body is matter\u201d\n(1037a5). It is further developed, in the\nMetaphysics, in \u0396.17, as we will see below, and\nespecially in De Anima. For more detail on this topic, see\nSection 3 of the entry on\n Aristotle\u2019s psychology.\n\nReturning now to the problem raised by the apparent need to refer to\nmatter in the definition of a substance, we may note that the solution\nAristotle offered in \u0396.10 is only partially successful. His point\nseems to be that whereas bronze may be a part of a particular statue,\nneither that particular batch of bronze nor even bronze in general\nenters into the essence of statue, since being made of bronze is no\npart of what it is to be a statue. But that is only because statues,\nalthough they must be made of some kind of matter, do not require any\nparticular kind of matter. But what about kinds of substances that do\nrequire particular kinds of matter? Aristotle\u2019s distinction\nbetween form and compound cannot be used in such cases to isolate\nessence from matter. Thus there may after all be reasons for thinking\nthat reference to matter will have to intrude into at least some\ndefinitions.\n\nIn \u0396.11, Aristotle addresses just such a case (although the\npassage is difficult and there is disagreement over its\ninterpretation). \u201cThe form of the human is always found in flesh\nand bones and parts of this sort,\u201d Aristotle writes\n(1036b4). The point is not just that each particular man\nmust be made of matter, but that each one must be made of matter of a\nparticular kind\u2014flesh and bones, etc. \u201cSome things,\u201d\nhe continues, \u201cpresumably are this in this\u201d\n(1036b23), i.e., a particular form in a particular kind of\nmatter, so that it is not possible to define them without reference to\ntheir material parts (1036b28). Nevertheless, Aristotle\nends \u0396.11 as if he has defended the claim that definition is of\nthe form alone. Perhaps his point is that whenever it is essential to\na substance that it be made of a certain kind of matter (e.g., that\nman be made of flesh and bones, and that one \u201ccould not make a\nsaw of wool or wood,\u201d \u0397.4, 1044a28) this is in\nsome sense a formal or structural requirement. A kind of matter, after\nall, can itself be analyzed hylomorphically\u2014bronze, for example,\nis a mixture of copper and tin according to a certain ratio or formula\n(logos), which is in turn predicated of some more generic\nunderlying subject. The reference to matter in a definition will thus\nalways be to a certain kind of matter, and hence to a predicate,\nrather than a subject. At any rate, if by \u2018matter\u2019 one has\nin mind the ultimate subject alluded to in \u0396.3 (so-called\n\u2018prime matter\u2019), there will be no reference to it in any\ndefinition, \u201cfor it is indefinite\u201d\n(1037a27).\n\n\n \u0396.12 introduces a new problem about definitions\u2014the\nso-called \u201cunity of definition.\u201d The problem is this:\ndefinitions are complex (a definiens is always some combination of\nterms), so what accounts for the definiendum being one thing,\nrather than many (1037b10)? Suppose that man is defined as\ntwo-footed animal; \u201cwhy, then, is this one and not\nmany\u2014animal and two-footed?\u201d\n(1037b13\u201314). Presumably, Aristotle has in mind his\ndiscussion in \u0396.4 of such \u201caccidental unities\u201d as a\npale man. The difference cannot be that our language contains a single\nword (\u2018man\u2019) for a two-footed animal, but no single word\nfor a pale man, for Aristotle has already conceded\n(1029b28) that we might very well have had a single term\n(he suggests himation, literally \u2018cloak\u2019) for a\npale man, but that would still not make the formula \u2018pale\nman\u2019 a definition nor pale man an essence\n(1030a2).\n\nAristotle proposes a solution that applies to definitions reached by\nthe \u201cmethod of division.\u201d According to this method (see\n Aristotle\u2019s logic),\n one begins with the broadest genus containing the species to be\ndefined, and divides the genus into two sub-genera by means of some\ndifferentia. One then locates the definiendum in one of the\nsub-genera, and proceeds to divide this by another differentia, and so\non, until one arrives at the definiendum species. This is a classic\ndefinition by genus and differentia. Aristotle\u2019s proposal is\nthat \u201cthe division should take the differentia of the\ndifferentia\u201d (1038a9). For example, if one uses the\ndifferentia footed to divide the genus animal, one\nthen uses a differentia such as cloven-footed for the next\ndivision. If one divides in this way, Aristotle claims, \u201cit is\nevident that the ultimate (or completing, teleutaia)\ndifferentia will be the substance of the thing and its\ndefinition\u201d (1038a19). For each \u201cdifferentia of\na differentia\u201d entails its predecessor (being cloven-footed\nentails being footed), and so the long chain of differentiae can be\nreplaced simply by the ultimate differentia, since it entails all of\nits predecessors. As Aristotle points out, it would be redundant to\ninclude any of the differentiae in the chain other than the ultimate\none: \u201cwhen we say footed two-footed animal \u2026 we shall be\nsaying the same thing several times over\u201d\n(1038a22\u201324).\n\nThis proposal shows how a long string of differentiae in a definition\ncan be reduced to one, but it does not solve the problem of the unity\nof definition. For we are still faced with the apparent fact that\ngenus + differentia constitutes a plurality even if the differentia is\nthe ultimate, or \u201ccompleting,\u201d one. It is not surprising,\nthen, that Aristotle\n returns to the problem of unity\n later (\u0397.6) and offers a different solution.\n",
