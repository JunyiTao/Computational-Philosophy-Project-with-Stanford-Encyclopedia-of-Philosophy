The Character of Auriol\u2019s Thought and Some Noteworthy Positions\n\nAuriol\u2019s thought is relentlessly systematic; one finds certain\nbasic ideas or devices that crop up time and again in extremely varied\nphilosophical and theological contexts. Given this, it seems clear\nthat at an early stage in his career Auriol settled on these basic\nideas and devices as those best representing his fundamental\nconvictions, and then applied them rigorously, so that his philosophy\nand theology emerge from them like spokes from a hub. As a\nconsequence, Auriol\u2019s thought has the appearance of being\nextremely unified.\n\nAuriol also exhibits throughout his works a pronounced historical\nbent. That is to say, when dealing with nearly every philosophical or\ntheological issue, he takes as his point of departure a detailed\nanalysis of earlier and contemporary ideas on the matter at hand,\noffering for the most part accurate summaries of other positions and\ngenerally perceptive critiques. On the basis of this analysis of\nearlier positions, Auriol\u2019s own thought often takes shape as he\nproposes positions that have the goal of avoiding the pitfalls he sees\nin his predecessors\u2019 ideas. A recent study of Auriol\u2019s\ncitation practice in his Scriptum (Schabel 2009) has shown\nthat the top five university authors explicitly cited are, in reverse\norder: Durand of St. Pourcain, Hervaeus Natalis, Henry of Ghent,\nThomas Aquinas, and John Duns Scotus. While these were the authors who\nclearly had the greatest impact on Auriol\u2019s thought, he\nresponded throughout his works to many other theologians, including\nWilliam of Ware, Godfrey of Fontaines, Bonaventure, Richard of\nMediavilla (Middleton), Thomas Wylton, and Giles of Rome. Moreover,\nAuriol is clearly extremely well-versed in ancient and Arabic thought.\n(See e.g., Duba 2001.)\n\nFinally, Auriol is well known for proposing unusual and sometimes\nradical solutions to traditional problems. This was one of the reasons\nwhy Auriol\u2019s thought was so provocative to his contemporaries\nand to readers right into the seventeenth century. Recent research has\npointed to several areas of Auriol\u2019s thought as particularly\ninnovative. Among these areas can be mentioned the following.\n",
