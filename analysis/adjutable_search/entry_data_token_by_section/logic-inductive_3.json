What we now\nrecognize as formal deductive logic rests on the meanings\n(i.e., the truth-functional properties) of the standard logical terms.\nThese logical terms, and the symbols we will employ to represent them,\nare as follows: \n\n\u2018not\u2019, \u2018\\({\\nsim}\\)\u2019; \n\u2018and\u2019, \u2018\\(\\cdot\\)\u2019; \n\u2018inclusive or\u2019, \u2018\\(\\vee\\)\u2019;\ntruth-functional \u2018if-then\u2019, \u2018\\(\\supset\\)\u2019;\n\n\u2018if and only if\u2019, \u2018\\(\\equiv\\)\u2019; \nthe quantifiers\n\n\n\u2018all\u2019, \u2018\\(\\forall\\)\u2019, and \n\u2018some\u2019, \u2018\\(\\exists\\)\u2019; \n and \nthe identity relation, \u2018=\u2019.\n\n\nThe meanings of all other terms, the non-logical terms such as names\nand predicate and relational expressions, are permitted to\n\u201cfloat free\u201d. That is, the logical validity of deductive\narguments depends neither on the meanings of the name and predicate\nand relation terms, nor on the truth-values of sentences containing\nthem. It merely supposes that these non-logical terms are meaningful,\nand that sentences containing them have truth-values. Deductive logic\nthen tells us that the logical structures of some\nsentences\u2014i.e., the syntactic arrangements of their logical\nterms\u2014preclude them from being jointly true of any possible\nstate of affairs. This is the notion of logical\ninconsistency. The notion of logical entailment is\ninter-definable with it. A collection of premise sentences\nlogically entails a conclusion sentence just when the\nnegation of the conclusion is logically inconsistent with\nthose premises.\n\nAn inductive logic must, it seems, deviate from the paradigm provided\nby deductive logic in several significant ways. For one thing, logical\nentailment is an absolute, all-or-nothing relationship between\nsentences, whereas inductive support comes in degrees-of-strength. For\nanother, although the notion of inductive support is\nanalogous to the deductive notion of logical entailment, and\nis arguably an extension of it, there seems to be no inductive logic\nextension of the notion of logical inconsistency\u2014at\nleast none that is inter-definable with inductive support in\nthe way that logical inconsistency is inter-definable with\nlogical entailment. Indeed, it turns out that when the\nunconditional probability of \\((B\\cdot{\\nsim}A)\\) is very nearly 0\n(i.e., when \\((B\\cdot{\\nsim}A)\\) is \u201cnearly\ninconsistent\u201d), the degree to which B inductively\nsupports A, \\(P[A \\pmid B]\\), may range anywhere between 0\nand 1. \n\nAnother notable difference is that when B logically\nentails A, adding a premise C cannot undermine the\nlogical entailment\u2014i.e., \\((C\\cdot B)\\) must logically entail\nA as well. This property of logical entailment is\ncalled monotonicity. But inductive support is\nnonmonotonic. In general, depending on what \\(A, B\\), and\nC mean, adding a premise C to B may substantially\nraise the degree of support for A, or may substantially lower\nit, or may leave it completely unchanged\u2014i.e., \\(P[A \\pmid\n(C\\cdot B)]\\) may have a value much larger than \\(P[A \\pmid B]\\), or\nmay have a much smaller value, or it may have the same, or nearly the\nsame value as \\(P[A \\pmid B]\\).\n\nIn a formal treatment of probabilistic inductive logic, inductive\nsupport is represented by conditional probability functions defined on\nsentences of a formal language L. These conditional probability\nfunctions are constrained by certain rules or axioms that are\nsensitive to the meanings of the logical terms (i.e.,\n\u2018not\u2019, \u2018and\u2019, \u2018or\u2019, etc., the\nquantifiers \u2018all\u2019 and \u2018some\u2019, and the identity\nrelation). The axioms apply without regard for what the other terms of\nthe language may mean. In essence the axioms specify a family of\npossible support functions, \\(\\{P_{\\beta}, P_{\\gamma}, \\ldots\n,P_{\\delta}, \\ldots \\}\\) for a given language L. Although each\nsupport function satisfies these same axioms, the further issue of\nwhich among them provides an appropriate measure of inductive\nsupport is not settled by the axioms alone. That may depend on\nadditional factors, such as the meanings of the non-logical terms\n(i.e., the names and predicate expressions) of the language.\n\nA good way to specify the axioms of the logic of inductive support\nfunctions is as follows. These axioms are apparently weaker than the\nusual axioms for conditional probabilities. For instance, the usual\naxioms assume that conditional probability values are restricted to\nreal numbers between 0 and 1. The following axioms do not assume this,\nbut only that support functions assign some real numbers as values for\nsupport strengths. However, it turns out that the following axioms\nsuffice to derive all the usual axioms for conditional probabilities\n(including the usual restriction to values between 0 and 1). We draw\non these weaker axioms only to forestall some concerns about whether the support\nfunction axioms may assume too much, or may be overly restrictive.\n\n\nLet L be a language for predicate logic with identity, and let\n\u2018\\(\\vDash\\)\u2019 be the standard logical entailment\nrelation\u2014i.e., the expression \u2018\\(B\n\\vDash A\\)\u2019 says\n\u201cB logically entails A\u201d and the expression \u2018\\(\\vDash\nA\\)\u2019 says\n\u201cA is a tautology\u201d. A support function is a\nfunction \\(P_{\\alpha}\\) from pairs of sentences of L to real\nnumbers that satisfies the following axioms:\n\n(1)\\(P_{\\alpha}[E\n\\pmid F] \\ne P_{\\alpha}[G \\pmid H]\\) for at\nleast some sentences \\(E, F, G\\), and H. \n\n\nFor all sentence \\(A, B, C\\), and D:\n\n(2) If\n\\(B \\vDash A\\), then \\(P_{\\alpha}[A \\pmid B] \\ge P_{\\alpha}[C \\pmid\nD]\\); \n(3)\n\\(P_{\\alpha}[A \\pmid (B \\cdot C)] = P_{\\alpha}[A \\pmid (C \\cdot B)]\\);\n\n(4) If\n\\(C \\vDash{\\nsim}(B \\cdot A)\\), then either \n\n\\[P_{\\alpha}[(A \\vee B) \\pmid  C] = P_{\\alpha}[A \\pmid  C] + P_{\\alpha}[B \\pmid  C]\\]\n\n \n\n or else \\[P_{\\alpha}[E \\pmid  C] = P_{\\alpha}[C \\pmid  C]\\] for every sentence E; \n(5)\n\\(P_{\\alpha}[(A \\cdot B) \\pmid C] = P_{\\alpha}[A \\pmid (B \\cdot C)]\n\\times P_{\\alpha}[B \\pmid C]\\). \n\n\n\nThis axiomatization takes conditional probability as basic, as seems\nappropriate for evidential support functions. (These\nfunctions agree with the more usual unconditional probability\nfunctions when the latter are defined\u2014just let \\(P_{\\alpha}[A] =\nP_{\\alpha}[A \\pmid (D \\vee{\\nsim}D)]\\). However, these axioms permit\nconditional probabilities \\(P_{\\alpha}[A \\pmid C]\\) to remain defined\neven when condition statement C has probability 0\u2014i.e.,\neven when \\(P_{\\alpha}[C \\pmid (D\\vee{\\nsim}D)] = 0\\).)\n\nNotice that conditional probability functions apply only to pairs of\nsentences, a conclusion sentence and a premise sentence. So, in\nprobabilistic inductive logic we represent finite collections of\npremises by conjoining them into a single sentence. Rather than say,\n\n\n\nA is supported to degree r by the set of premises\n\\(\\{B_1\\), \\(B_2\\), \\(B_3\\),\u2026, \\(B_n\\}\\), \n\n\nwe instead say that \n\n\nA is supported to degree r by the conjunctive premise\n\\((((B_1\\cdot B_2)\\cdot B_3)\\cdot \\ldots \\cdot B_n)\\),\n\n\nand write this as  \n\n\\[P[A \\pmid  ( ((B_1\\cdot B_2)\\cdot B_3)\\cdot \\ldots \\cdot B_n)] = r.\\]\n\n\nThe above axioms are quite weak. For instance, they do not say that\nlogically equivalent sentences are supported by all other sentences to\nthe same degree; rather, that result is derivable from these axioms\n(see\n result 6\n below). Nor do these axioms say that logically equivalent sentences\nsupport all other sentences to the same degree; rather, that result is\nalso derivable (see\n result 8\n below). Indeed, from these axioms all of the usual theorems of\nprobability theory may be derived. The following results are\nparticularly useful in probabilistic logic. Their derivations from\nthese axioms are provided in note\n 2.[2]\n\n\nIf \\(B \\vDash A\\), then \\(P_{\\alpha}[A \\pmid B] =\n1\\). \nIf \\(C \\vDash{\\nsim}(B\\cdot A)\\), then either\n\n\\[P_{\\alpha}[(A \\vee B) \\pmid  C] = P_{\\alpha}[A \\pmid  C] + P_{\\alpha}[B \\pmid  C]\\] \n\n or else \\(P_{\\alpha}[E \\pmid C] = 1\\) for every sentence\nE. \n\\(P_{\\alpha}[{\\nsim}A \\pmid B] = 1 - P_{\\alpha}[A\n\\pmid B]\\) or else \\(P_{\\alpha}[C \\pmid B] = 1\\) for every sentence\nC.\n\\(1 \\ge P_{\\alpha}[A \\pmid B] \\ge 0\\).\nIf \\(B \\vDash A\\), then \\(P_{\\alpha}[A \\pmid C] \\ge\nP_{\\alpha}[B \\pmid C]\\).\nIf \\(B \\vDash A\\) and \\(A \\vDash B\\), then\n\\(P_{\\alpha}[A \\pmid C] = P_{\\alpha}[B \\pmid C]\\).\nIf \\(C \\vDash B\\), then \\(P_{\\alpha}[(A\\cdot B)\n\\pmid C] = P_{\\alpha}[(B\\cdot A) \\pmid C] = P_{\\alpha}[A \\pmid\nC]\\).\nIf \\(C \\vDash B\\) and \\(B \\vDash C\\), then\n\\(P_{\\alpha}[A \\pmid B] = P_{\\alpha}[A \\pmid C]\\).\n\\(P_{\\alpha}[B \\pmid C] \\gt 0\\), then \n\n\\[P_{\\alpha}[A \\pmid  (B\\cdot C)] = P_{\\alpha}[B \\pmid  (A\\cdot C)] \\times \\frac{P_{\\alpha}[A \\pmid  C]}{P_{\\alpha}[B \\pmid  C]}\\]\n\n(this is a simple form of Bayes\u2019 theorem).\n \\(P_{\\alpha}[(A\\vee B) \\pmid C] = P_{\\alpha}[A\n\\pmid C] + P_{\\alpha}[B \\pmid C] - P_{\\alpha}[(A\\cdot B) \\pmid C]\\).\n\nIf \\(\\{B_1 , \\ldots ,B_n\\}\\) is any finite set of\nsentences such that for each pair \\(B_i\\) and \\(B_j, C\n\\vDash{\\nsim}(B_{i}\\cdot B_{j})\\) (i.e., the members of the set are\nmutually exclusive, given C), then either \\(P_{\\alpha}[D\n\\pmid C] = 1\\) for\nevery sentence D, or \n\n\\[\nP_{\\alpha}[((B_1\\vee B_2)\\vee \\ldots \\vee B_n) \\pmid  C] = \\sum ^{n}_{i=1} P_{\\alpha}[B_i \\pmid  C].\n\\]\nIf \\(\\{B_1 , \\ldots ,B_n , \\ldots \\}\\) is any\ncountably infinite set of sentences such that for each pair \\(B_i\\)\nand \\(B_j, C \\vDash{\\nsim}(B_{i}\\cdot B_{j})\\), then either\n\\(P_{\\alpha}[D \\pmid C] = 1\\) for every sentence D,\n or[3]\n \n\n\\[\n\\lim_n P_{\\alpha}[((B_1\\vee B_2)\\vee \\ldots \\vee B_n) \\pmid  C] =\n\\sum^{\\infty}_{i=1}\nP_{\\alpha}[B_i \\pmid  C].\n\\]\n\n \n\n\nLet us now briefly consider each axiom to see how plausible it is as a\nconstraint on a quantitative measure of inductive support, and how it\nextends the notion of deductive entailment. First notice that each\ndegree-of-support function \\(P_{\\alpha}\\) on L\nmeasures support strength with some real number values, but\nthe axioms don\u2019t explicitly restrict these values to lie between\n0 and 1. It turns out that the all support values must lie between 0\nand 1, but this follows from the axioms, rather than being assumed by\nthem. The scaling of inductive support via the real numbers is surely\na reasonable way to go.\n\nAxiom 1\n is a non-triviality requirement. It says that the support values\ncannot be the same for all sentence pairs. This axiom merely rules out\nthe trivial support function that assigns the same amount of support\nto each sentence by every sentence. One might replace this axiom with\nthe following rule:  \n\n\\[P_{\\alpha}[(A\\vee{\\nsim}A) \\pmid  (A\\vee{\\nsim}A)] \\ne P_{\\alpha}[(A\\cdot{\\nsim}A) \\pmid  (A\\vee{\\nsim}A)].\\]\n\n\nBut this alternative rule turns out to be derivable from axiom 1\ntogether with the other axioms.\n\nAxiom 2\n asserts that when B logically entail A, the\nsupport of A by B is as strong as support can possibly\nbe. This comports with the idea that an inductive support function is\na generalization of the deductive entailment relation, where the\npremises of deductive entailments provide the strongest possible\nsupport for their conclusions.\n\nAxiom 3\n merely says that \\((B \\cdot C)\\) supports sentences to precisely the\nsame degree that \\((C \\cdot B)\\) supports them. This is an especially\nweak axiom. But taken together with the other axioms, it suffices to\nentail that logically equivalent sentences support all sentences to\nprecisely the same degree.\n\nAxiom 4\n says that inductive support adds up in a plausible way. When\nC logically entails the incompatibility of A and\nB, i.e., when no possible state of affairs can make both\nA and B true together, the degrees of support that\nC provides to each of them individually must sum to the support\nit provides to their disjunction. The only exception is in those cases\nwhere C acts like a logical contradiction and supports all\nsentences to the maximum possible degree (in deductive logic a logical\ncontradiction logically entails every sentence).\n\nTo understand what\n axiom 5\n says, think of a support function \\(P_{\\alpha}\\) as describing a\nmeasure on possible states of affairs. Read each degree-of-support\nexpression of form \u2018\\(P_{\\alpha}[D \\pmid E] = r\\)\u2019 to say\nthat the proportion of states of affairs in which D is true\namong those states of affairs where E is true is r. Read\nthis way, axiom 5 then says the following. Suppose B is true in\nproportion q of all the states of affairs where C is\ntrue, and suppose A is true in fraction r of those\nstates where B and C are true together. Then A\nand B should be true together in what proportion of all the\nstates where C is true? In fraction r (the \\((A\\cdot\nB)\\) part) of proportion q (the B portion) of all those\nstates where C is true.\n\nThe degree to which a sentence B supports a sentence A\nmay well depend on what these sentences mean. In particular it will\nusually depend on the meanings we associate with the non-logical terms\n(those terms other than the logical terms not, and,\nor, etc., the quantifiers, and identity), that is, on the\nmeanings of the names, and the predicate and relation terms of the\nlanguage. For example, we should want  \n\n\\[P_{\\alpha}[\\textrm{George is not married} \\pmid  \\textrm{George is a bachelor}] = 1,\\]\n\n\ngiven the usual meanings of \u2018bachelor\u2019 and\n\u2018married\u2019, since \u201call bachelors are unmarried\u201d\nis analytically true\u2014i.e. no empirical evidence is required to\nestablish this connection. (In the formal language for predicate\nlogic, if we associate the meaning \u201cis married\u201d with\npredicate term \u2018M\u2019, the meaning \u201cis a\nbachelor\u201d with the predicate term \u2018B\u2019, and\ntake the name term \u2018g\u2019 to refer to George, then we\nshould want \\(P_{\\alpha}[{\\nsim}Mg \\pmid Bg] = 1\\), since \\(\\forall x\n(Bx \\supset{\\nsim}Mx)\\) is analytically true on this meaning\nassignment to the non-logical terms.) So, let\u2019s associate with\neach individual support function \\(P_{\\alpha}\\) a specific assignment\nof meanings (primary intensions) to all the non-logical terms\nof the language. (However, evidential support functions should not\npresuppose meaning assignments in the sense of so-called secondary\nintensions\u2014e.g., those associated with rigid designators across possible states of affairs. For, we should not want a confirmation function\n\\(P_{\\alpha}\\) to make  \n\n\\[P_{\\alpha}[\\textrm{This glass is full of H\\(_2\\)O} \\pmid  \\textrm{This glass is full of water}] = 1,\\]\n\n\nsince we presumably want the inductive logic to draw on explicit\nempirical evidence to support the claim that water is made of\nH2O. Thus, the meanings of terms we associate with a\nsupport function should only be their primary intensions, not their\nsecondary intensions.)\nIn the context of inductive logic it\nmakes good sense to supplement the above axioms with two additional\naxioms. Here is the first of them:\n\n(6) If\nA is an axiom of set theory or any other piece of pure\nmathematics employed by the sciences, or if A is\nanalytically true (i.e., if the truth of A depends\nonly on the meanings of the words it contains, where the specific\nmeanings for names and predicates are those associated with the\nparticular support function \\(P_{\\alpha})\\), then, for all sentences\nC, \\(P_{\\alpha}[A \\pmid C] = P_{\\alpha}[C \\pmid C]\\) (i.e.,\n\\(P_{\\alpha}[A \\pmid C] = 1)\\).\n\n\nHere is how axiom 6 applies to the above example, yielding\n\\(P_{\\alpha}[{\\nsim}Mg \\pmid Bg] = 1\\) when the meaning assignments to\nnon-logical terms associated with support function \\(P_{\\alpha}\\)\nmakes \\(\\forall x(Bx \\supset{\\nsim}Mx)\\) analytically true. From\naxiom 6 (followed by results 7, 5, and 4) we have  \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n1 & = P_{\\alpha}[\\forall x(Bx \\supset{\\nsim}Mx) \\pmid  Bg] \\\\\n& = P_{\\alpha}[(Bg \\cdot \\forall x(Bx \\supset{\\nsim}Mx)) \\pmid  Bg]\\\\\n& \\le P_{\\alpha}[{\\nsim}Mg \\pmid  Bg] \\\\\n& \\le 1;\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nthus, \\(P_{\\alpha}[{\\nsim}Mg \\pmid Bg] = 1\\). The idea behind axiom 6\nis that inductive logic is about evidential support for contingent\nclaims. Nothing can count as empirical evidence for or against\nnon-contingent truths. In particular, analytic truths should be\nmaximally supported by all premises C. \n\nOne important respect in which inductive logic should follow\nthe deductive paradigm is that the logic should not presuppose the truth of\ncontingent statements. If a statement C is contingent, then some other statements should be able to count as evidence against C. Otherwise, a support function \\(P_{\\alpha}\\) will take C and all of its logical consequences to be supported to degree 1 by all possible evidence claims.\nThis is no way for an inductive logic to behave. The whole idea of inductive logic is\nto provide a measure of the extent to which premise statements indicate\nthe likely truth-values of contingent conclusion statements. This idea\nwon\u2019t work properly if the truth-values of some contingent\nstatements are presupposed by assigning them support value 1 on every possible premise. Such probability assignments would make the inductive logic enthymematic\nby hiding significant premises in inductive support relationships.\nIt would be analogous to permitting deductive arguments to count as valid \nin cases where the explicitly stated premises are insufficient to logically entail the conclusion, but where the validity of the argument is permitted to depend on additional unstated premises. This is not how a\nrigorous approach to deductive logic should work, and it should not be a common\npractice in a rigorous approach to inductive logic.\n\nNevertheless, it is common practice for probabilistic logicians to\nsweep provisionally accepted contingent claims under the rug by\nassigning them probability 1 (regardless of the fact that no explicit\nevidence for them is provided). This practice saves\nthe trouble of repeatedly writing a given contingent sentence B\nas a premise, since \\(P_{\\gamma}[A \\pmid B\\cdot C]\\) will equal\n\\(P_{\\gamma}[A \\pmid C]\\) whenever \\(P_{\\gamma}[B \\pmid C] = 1\\).\nAlthough this convention is useful, such probability functions should\nbe considered mere abbreviations for proper, logically explicit,\nnon-enthymematic, inductive support relations. Thus, properly\nspeaking, an inductive support function \\(P_{\\alpha}\\) should not\nassign probability 1 to a sentence on every possible premise unless\nthat sentence is either (i) logically true, or (ii) an axiom of set\ntheory or some other piece of pure mathematics employed by the\nsciences, or (iii) unless according to the interpretation of the\nlanguage that \\(P_{\\alpha}\\) presupposes, the sentence is\nanalytic (and so outside the realm of evidential support).\nThus, we adopt the following version of the so-called \u201caxiom of\nregularity\u201d.\n\n(7) If,\nfor all C, \\(P_{\\alpha}[A \\pmid C] = P_{\\alpha}[C \\pmid C]\\)\n(i.e., \\(P_{\\alpha}[A \\pmid C] = 1\\)), then A must be a logical\ntruth or an axiom of set theory or some other piece of pure\nmathematics employed by the sciences, or A must be\nanalytically true (according to the meanings of the terms of\nL associated with support function \\(P_{\\alpha})\\).\n\n\nAxioms 6 and 7 taken together say that a support function\n\\(P_{\\alpha}\\) counts as non-contingently true, and so not subject to\nempirical support, just those sentences that are assigned probability\n1 by every premise.\n\nSome Bayesian logicists have proposed that an inductive logic might be\nmade to depend solely on the logical form of sentences, as is the case\nfor deductive logic. The idea is, effectively, to supplement axioms\n1\u20137 with additional axioms that depend only on the logical\nstructures of sentences, and to introduce enough such axioms to reduce\nthe number of possible support functions to a single uniquely best\nsupport function. It is now widely agreed that this project cannot be\ncarried out in a plausible way. Perhaps support functions should obey\nsome rules in addition to axioms 1\u20137. But it is doubtful that\nany plausible collection of additional rules can suffice to determine\na single, uniquely qualified support function. Later, in\n Section 3, we will briefly return to this issue,\n after we develop a more detailed account of how inductive probabilities\ncapture the relationship between hypotheses and evidence.\n",
