    "main_text": "Knowledge\n5. Knowledge\n\n\nIn The Problem of Knowledge (1956), Ayer defended a\ncontext-based account of knowledge that had as its essential\ningredients that some claim, p, counted as knowledge for a\nperson, A, iff p was true, A was sure that\np, and A had, in the relevant context, \u2018the\nright to be sure\u2019 about the truth of p. The contextual\nelement is apparent in the discussion after Ayer outlines what is\nrequired to have the \u2018right to be sure\u2019 in the\nmathematical case. One avenue to knowledge in this case lies in the\nability of the agent to provide a proof of the relevant\nproposition. In the case of perception, or memory, it is clear that it\nis impossible to possess such a proof, so a more relaxed standard is\nrequired. To state in general how strong the backing needs to\nbe for a believer to have the right to be sure that their belief is\ntrue is not possible; doing so would require drawing up a list of\nconditions \u201cunder which perception, or memory, or testimony, or\nother forms of evidence are reliable.\u201d (1956, p. 32.) Ayer\nthought this would be too complicated a task, if at all possible. The\n\u2018correct\u2019 standard to set for claims to knowledge is to be\ndecided pragmatically, on grounds of practical convenience. The\nskeptic\u2019s ploy of setting an impossible standard, one requiring the\nimpossibility of error, should be resisted, as one has the right to be\nsure even where error is possible.\n\n\nThe account offered was intended as an analysis of knowledge, but\nrevealingly Ayer did not require that believers be aware of how they\nhave the right to be sure. It was allowed that somebody who invariably\ncorrectly predicted the outcome of a lottery could be said to\nknow that their prediction was true, even though they, nor anyone\nelse, had any idea of how the predictions came to be reliable. Ayer\nadmitted that this case, and others like it, may cause some dispute:\nit was not clearly covered by the meaning of the term\n\u2018knowledge\u2019, and so left room for some stipulation.\n\n\nAyer\u2019s particular analysis, or one closely resembling it, came\nunder attack in a famous paper by Gettier (1963), in which\nsatisfaction of the three clauses (the truth of p, the belief\nin p, and the right to be sure that\np) was held to be insufficient for knowledge.  Gettier\u2019s\nargument requires that someone, A, could be justified in\nbelieving a false proposition, and that if A was justified in\nbelieving p and q is deducible from p, and\nA accepted q by deducing it from p, then\nA would be justified in believing q. An example used\nby Gettier has the following structure: (i) Jones owns a Ford. (ii)\nEither Jones owns a Ford or Brown is in Boston. Smith believes, and\nhas ample evidence for, (i). He deduces (ii) from (i), and so is\njustified in believing (ii), even though, in fact, he has no idea of\nwhere Brown is. It turns out that (i) is false, but (ii) is true\n\u2013 unbeknownst to Smith, Brown is indeed in Boston. Gettier\nconcluded that in this case all three clauses of the analysis of\nknowledge are satisfied, but that we should judge in this case that\nSmith did not know (ii). The suggestion was that additional clauses might be needed.\n\n\nThe literature spawned by the Gettier counter-examples is huge, nearly\nall of it attempting to pin down the elusive additional\nclause(s). Ayer himself did not think that any such additional clauses\nwere needed. The counter-examples, he thought, showed that what was\nneeded was a more careful account of what \u2018being\njustified\u2019 consisted in. He disputed Gettier\u2019s claim that any\ndeduction from a justified, but false, proposition preserves\njustification. We already knew, he claimed, that the notion of having\nevidence for a claim is very difficult to elucidate; Carl Hempel\u2019s\nparadoxes succeeded in showing that. Once we had managed to throw more\nlight on the justification relation, we would see that his proposed\nanalysis was sufficient for knowledge.\n6. Necessity, Causality, and Freedom\n\n\nWe have seen that in LTL Ayer maintained that all necessary\ntruths were true in virtue of the meanings of the terms used in\nexpressing them, this in turn depending on the conventions governing\nthe use of those terms. One can see in the expression of this early\nview unease about the source of logical necessity. He describes the\nnecessity of logical truths as dependent on the rules governing the\nuse of logical constants. Although such rules are neither true nor\nfalse, they elucidate the \u201cproper\u201d use of such constants,\na formulation suggesting that the source of the necessity is deeper\nthan mere linguistic usage.\n\n\nLater, cleaving (or perhaps clinging) to his \u201call necessity is\nde dicto\u201d starting point, he consistently refused to\ncountenance any de re necessities. He strenuously resisted\nthe essentialism that became fashionable following the work of Putnam\nand Kripke in the 1970s, but his reasons for doing so were not always\nto the point. In his argument against essence-based de re\nnecessities Ayer would say that \u201cCaesar is necessarily\nhuman\u201d is not true, since he could have called his dog\n\u201cCaesar\u201d. Here he lost sight of his own insistence (in the\nIntroduction to the 2nd. Edition of LTL) that\nnecessary truths were expressed in a language whose terms had already\nbeen assigned meaning and reference, so changing the reference of\n\u201cCaesar\u201d is irrelevant to the necessary truth of a\nsentence employing the term with its \u2018normal\u2019\nreference.\n\n\nOf greater relevance was his suspicion of the move from conceivability\nto possibility, and inconceivability to impossibility, thinking that\nanswers to questions about conceivability were dependent upon the\nstate of knowledge and imaginative powers of the person entertaining\nthem. Was it inconceivable that Caesar (the Julius of old) be\nnon-human? Ayer thought it consistent with everything he knew of\nCaesar (apart from his being human) that Caesar was a robot, so he\ncould \u201ceasily conceive of it as a possibility\u201d\n(\u201cReplies\u201d p. 308). On the other hand, if asked whether\nCaesar was a tortoise, he would suspect that the word\n\u201cCaesar\u201d was here used with a different reference in mind.\nAyer buttressed this thought by suggesting that the descriptions\nsecuring the referent of the term \u201cCaesar\u201d would normally\nmake it logically inconsistent that the satisfier of the descriptions\nbe a tortoise, but that this did not establish de re\nnecessities; it does not follow that the Caesar in question\nnecessarily satisfies the descriptions associated with the\nuse of the name. To the suggestion that something other than\ndescriptions might secure the proper reference, such as the causal\norigin of the use of the term, Ayer was dismissive: \u201c\u2026the\nidea \u2026that one can explain the nature of reference by saying\nthat what makes A\u2019s use of a sign s a\nreference to an object O is its causal derivation from\nsomeone\u2019s original use of s to refer to O is a\nmanifest absurdity. If one does not understand what it is for\ns to refer to O, one is none the wiser; and if one\ndoes, the causal flummery is otiose.\u201d (\u201cReplies\u201d\n1979 p. 309.)\n\n\nAyer\u2019s rejection of these kind of de re necessities was, at\nroot, a consequence of his epistemological approach to their\nevaluation. The senses of terms, he thought, were dependent on their\nassociated descriptions, these being dependent on what we knew of\ntheir reference, and these senses accounted for the presence or\nabsence of necessity. So it is identity of sense in \u201cHesperus is\nHesperus\u201d that makes that sentence necessarily true, whilst\nabsence of sense-identity renders \u201cHesperus is\nPhosphorous\u201d contingently true. He rejected the thought that\nnatural kind terms have their sense fixed by their internal\nconstitution on the grounds that many, if not most, users of natural\nkind terms are ignorant of the nature of the relevant internal\nconstitutions. In this he is in agreement with those who recognize the\nkind of necessity arising from primary intensions (Chalmers 2004) or\n\u2018A intensions\u2019 (Jackson 1998), such intensions\nbeing determined by (some) phenomenal properties of the kinds referred\nto.\n\n\nAyer also repudiated causal necessity. Following Hume, he\nthought causation could be reduced to regularity: \u201cc\ncauses e\u201d is equivalent to \u201cwhenever c\nthen e\u201d. This latter proposition is then a law of\nnature, which is just a generalization to which we have a certain\nattitude. So contingent generalizations and laws of nature are much\nthe same; they differ only in that we rely on the latter more than the\nformer, and are prepared to treat the law as though it possessed some\nstronger modality, though in fact it does not.\n\n\nThe lack of necessity attaching to causes made Ayer\u2019s acceptance of\nhuman freedom undemanding. Having denied the existence of any causal\nnecessity it was open to Ayer to be a compatibilist: determinism could\nbe true (all action could be caused), but one could still accept that\nthis left it open as to whether the agent could have done otherwise,\ngiven that the existence of the cause did not necessitate the\naction. Ayer argued that the relevant contrast to freedom was not\ncausality, but constraint, or compulsion, which are a\n\u2018special\u2019 sort of cause. So if our actions could be caused\nwhilst not being \u2018constrained\u2019 in any way, then\ndeterminism could be true and we could still be free. It was just as\nwell that this position was available, claimed Ayer, because being\nheld morally responsible for our actions required that these be not\nthe result of sheer chance.\n\n\nThis leaves, as Ayer recognized, a problem: if freedom is possible\nbecause causes don\u2019t necessitate, then am I ever unfree?\nAyer\u2019s reply was straightforward. It is only some causes that deprive\nus of freedom; if a robber puts a pistol to my head and demands my\nmoney, he has left me without a reasonable alternative, so I am not\nmorally responsible for the action I am made to do. So to say that I\ncould have done otherwise is just to say that I would have done\notherwise had I so chosen, that my action was voluntary in the way in\nwhich the kleptomaniac\u2019s isn\u2019t, and that nobody compelled me to\nact in the way that I did. (See \u201cFreedom and Necessity\u201d,\n1954). This \u2018resolution\u2019 of the problem remains\nunsatisfactory; Ayer\u2019s type of compatibilist does not have an\nacceptable account of why it is that some causes are sufficient to\nmake my action not free, whilst others contain no such threat. As he\nsays, all causes are equally necessitating \u2013 none of them\nnecessitate, not even the \u2018special\u2019 sort of causes that,\nhe alleges, threaten our freedom.\n7. Ethics\n\n\nThe emotivism espoused by Ayer in LTL was supported by his\nbelief in the distinction between fact and value. Given, he thought,\nthat there were no moral facts to be known, there could be no\nverification of such facts, and so moral utterances could have no\ncognitive significance. And given the connection between moral\n\u2018judgment\u2019 and motivation, and the connection between\nmotivation and feeling, it was natural to see moral utterances as\nhaving the function of expressing our feelings, or\n\u2018emoting\u2019. This view, Ayer was careful to point out, was\nnot that associated with subjectivism, that in making moral claims we\nare describing our feelings. This latter view would make\nmoral claims truth-evaluable, and Ayer\u2019s moral emotivism denied that\nthey were so evaluable. So when we say: \u201cCruelty towards\nchildren is wrong\u201d we are really expressing a negative attitude\ntowards killing children, and when we say \u201cBeing kind to old\npeople is good\u201d we are expressing positive feelings towards such\nacts of kindness. The expression of such positive or negative\nfeelings, he later thought, also contained a prescriptive element, so\nin such expressions we are also encouraging others to share those\nfeelings, and to act accordingly. As this makes clear, the attitudes\nexpressed were towards classes of acts, and not particular acts.\n\n\nEmotivism was thought by some to be the reductio ad absurdum\nof the verificationist theory of meaning, and indeed it was not the\npreferred metaethical position of other positivists, some of whom\npreferred a consequentialist approach, and so emotivism could be seen\nas separable from verificationism. In fact, in the\n\u201cIntroduction\u201d to the second edition of LTL Ayer\nstated that his commitment to emotivism would survive any demise of\nhis positivism, and it later became clear that it was because Ayer\nthought moral judgments to be not fact-stating that he concluded they\nwere unverifiable (see \u201cThe Analysis of Moral Judgments\u201d\nin Ayer 1954). Emotivism was given additional support by\nC.L.Stevenson, who had developed his ideas independently of Ayer, in\nhis book Ethics and Language (1944). In subsequent decades,\nit spawned a family of what came to be called\n\u201cexpressivist\u201d views in metaethics, which sought to state\nthe view with a sensitivity to the logical problems Ayer\u2019s\nformulation raised. \n\n\nIt has been suggested (Dreier 2004) that Ayer faced a particular\ndifficulty in defending this brand of non-cognitivism; the combination\nof affirming a redundancy theory of truth with the denial that moral\nclaims can be true looks suspicious. Although the two views are not\nincompatible (Ayer denied that moral claims were assertions, and the\nredundancy of the truth-predicate held only for assertions), the\ntension between the two is symptomatic of the worry that moral claims\nhave so many of the features of truth-evaluable assertions that one\nhas to be unjustifiably revisionist in construing them as\nnon-meaningful. They are, after all, typically expressed in indicative\nsentences, and people appear to dispute moral claims. This latter\npoint Ayer did respond to: moral disagreements were, he (and\nStevenson) claimed, either genuine disputes about non-moral facts, or\nsimply not genuine disagreements.  (For an examination of the trouble\nthat moral disagreement makes for emotivism, see Smith 1986.) There\nwas, however, a further, more troubling, point about the role of moral\nterms in arguments: moral terms can be used in arguments in which the\nmoral term appears in a conditional, and so is not there contributing\nto the expressive force of the utterance, so not expressing any\nemotion of the speaker. This latter point has been developed into a\nline of reasoning (called the \u201cFrege-Geach\u201d problem)\nagainst expressivism in general.  The problem for the expressivist is\nto make sense of simple arguments such as the following: (1) If John killed\nJane, he did something wrong. (2) John killed Jane. So (3) John did\nsomething wrong. The argument appears to be valid, and so not to\ninvolve any ambiguity, but the moral term can be construed as having\nexpressive force only in (3), not in (1).  Expressivism, and so\nemotivism, seems to introduce an unwarranted equivocation into the\nargument.\n\n\nIt is perhaps these \u2018surface\u2019 features of moral discourse,\nthose that make it look like moral claims are assertions, and hence\nexpressions of belief, and so truth-evaluable, and that moral\ndisagreement appears to be genuine moral disagreement, that\nlater tempted Ayer to consider Mackie\u2019s \u2018error\u2019 theory of\nmoral language (Mackie 1977) as closer to the truth (in Ayer\n1984). The details of emotivism tended to disappear from the\nmetaethical scene in the latter half of the twentieth century, but\nits guiding thoughts have remained very much alive in the expressivism\nof Blackburn 1984, 1998, and Gibbard 1990. (See Altham, 1979, for a\nsympathetic defense of these guiding thoughts, and Schroeder, 2010,\nfor a thorough treatment of the development of expressivism, with\nparticular attention paid to subsequent attempts to tackle the Frege-Geach\nproblem.)",
