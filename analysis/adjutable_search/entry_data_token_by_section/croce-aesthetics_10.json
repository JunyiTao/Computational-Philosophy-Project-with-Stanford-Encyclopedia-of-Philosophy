    "main_text": "The Identity of Art and Language\n8. The Identity of Art and Language\n\nThe title of the first great book of Croce\u2019s career was\n\u2018Aesthetic as a Science of expression and general\nlinguistic\u2019 (emphasis added). There are several\ninterconnected aspects to this.\n\nCroce claims that drawing, sculpting, writing of music and so on are\njust as much \u2018language\u2019 as poetry, and all\nlanguage is poetic; therefore \u2018Philosophy of language and\nphilosophy of art are the same thing\u2019 (Aes. 142;\nauthor\u2019s emphasis). The reason for this is that language is to\nbe understood as expressive; \u2018an emission of sounds which\nexpresses nothing is not language\u2019 (Aes. 143). From our\nperspective, we might regard Croce as arguing thus: (1) Referential\nsemantics\u2014scarcely mentioned by Croce\u2014necessarily involves\nparts of speech. (2) However:\n\nIt is false to say that a verb or noun is expressed in definite words,\ntruly distinguishable from others. Expression is an indivisible whole.\nNoun and verb do not exist in it, but are abstractions made by us,\ndestroying the sole linguistic reality, which is the\nsentence. (Aes. 146)\n\n\nIf we take this as asserting the primacy of sentence\nmeaning\u2014glossing over the anti-abstraction remark which is\ntantamount to a denial of syntactic compositionality\u2014then\ntogether with (3) a denial of what in modern terms would be\ndistinction between semantic and expressive meaning, or perhaps in\nFregean terms sense and tone, then it is not obvious that the\nresulting picture of language would not apply equally to, for example,\ndrawing. In that case, just as drawings cannot be translated, so\nlinguistic translation is impossible (though for certain purposes,\nnaturally, we can translate \u2018relatively\u2019; Aes.\n68).\n\nInterestingly, Croce does not think of all signs as natural\nsigns, as lightning is a sign of thunder; on the contrary, he thinks\nof \u2018pictures, poetry and all works of art\u2019 as equally\nconventional\u2014as \u2018historically conditioned\u2019\n(Aes. 125; authors emphasis).\n\nThere is no doubt that on this point Croce was inspired by his great\nprecursor, the Neapolitan Giambattista Vico (1668\u20131744).\nAccording to Croce (Aes. 220\u201334) Vico was the first to\nrecognise the aesthetic as a self-sufficient and non-conceptual mode\nof knowledge, and famously he held that all language is substantially\npoetry. The only serious mistake in this that Croce found was\nVico\u2019s belief in an actual historical period when all language\nwas poetry; it was the mistake of substituting a concrete history for\n\u2018ideal history\u2019 (Aes. 232).\n",
