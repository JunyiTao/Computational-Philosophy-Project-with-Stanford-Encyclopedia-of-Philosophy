    "main_text": "Types of Discrimination (in its Moralized Sense) || Indirect Discrimination\n2.2 Indirect Discrimination\n\n\nUnder many legal systems, an act that imposes a disproportionate\ndisadvantage on the members of a certain group can count as\ndiscriminatory, even though the agent has no intention to disadvantage\nthe members of the group and no other objectionable mental state, such\nas indifference or bias, motivating the act.  This form of\ndiscriminatory conduct is called \u201cindirect discrimination\u201d\nor, in the language of American doctrine, \u201cdisparate\nimpact\u201d discrimination. Thus, the European Court of Human Rights\n(ECHR) has held that \u201c[w]hen a general policy or measure has\ndisproportionately prejudicial effects on a particular group, it is\nnot excluded that this may be considered as discriminatory\nnotwithstanding that it is not specifically aimed or directed at that\ngroup\u201d (Shanaghan v. U.K. 2001: para. 129).\n\n\nIt should be noted that the ECHR says that policies with\ndisproportionate effects may be discriminatory even if that is\nnot the aim of the policies. So what criterion determines when a\npolicy with disproportionately worse effects on a certain group\nactually counts as indirect discrimination? There is no agreed\nupon answer.\n\n\nThe ECHR has laid down the following criterion: a policy with\ndisproportionate effects counts as indirect discrimination \u201cif\nit does not pursue a legitimate aim or if there is not a reasonable\nrelation of proportionality between means and aim\u201d (Abdulaziz et\nal. v. U.K., 1985: para. 721). The Human Rights Committee of the\nUnited Nations has judged that a policy with disproportionate effects\nis discriminatory \u201cif it is not based on objective and\nreasonable criteria\u201d (Moucheboeuf 2006: 100).  Under the British\nRace Relations Act, such a policy is discriminatory if the policymaker\n\u201ccannot show [the policy] to be justifiable irrespective of the\n\u2026 race \u2026 of the person to whom it is applied\u201d\n(Osin and Porat 2005: 900). And in its interpretation of the Civil\nRights Act of 1964, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that, in judging\nwhether the employment policies of private businesses are (indirectly)\ndiscriminatory, \u201c[i]f an employment practice which operates to\nexclude Negroes cannot be shown to be related to job performance, the\npractice is prohibited\u201d (Griggs v. Duke Power 1971:\n431).  Despite the differences, these criteria have a common thought\nbehind them: a disproportionately disadvantageous impact on the\nmembers of certain salient social groups must not be written off as\nmorally or legally irrelevant or dismissed as mere accident, but\nrather stands in need of justification. In other words, the impact\nmust not be treated as wholly inconsequential, as if it were\nequivalent, for example, to a disproportionate impact on persons with\nlong toe nails. Toe-nail group impact would require no justification,\nbecause it would simply be an accidental and morally inconsequential\nfeature of the act, at least in all actual societies. In contrast, the\nthought behind the idea of indirect discrimination is that, if an act\nhas a disproportionately disadvantageous impact on persons belonging\nto certain types of salient social groups, then the act is morally\nwrong and prohibited by anti-discrimination law unless it can meet\nsome suitable standard of justification.\n\n\nTo illustrate the idea of indirect discrimination, we can turn to the\nU.S. Supreme Court case, Griggs v. Duke Power (1971). A\ncompany in North Carolina used a written test to determine\npromotions. The use of the test had the result that almost all black\nemployees failed to qualify for the promotions. The company was not\naccused of direct discrimination, i.e., there was no claim that a\nracially discriminatory attitude was behind the decision of the\ncompany to use the written test. But the court found that the test did\nnot measure skills essential for the jobs in question and that the\nstate of North Carolina had a long history of deliberately\ndiscriminating against blacks by, among other things, providing\ngrossly inferior education to them. The state had only very recently\nbegun to rectify that situation. In ruling for the black plaintiffs,\nthe court reasoned that the policy of using the test was racially\ndiscriminatory, because of the test\u2019s disproportionate racial\nimpact combined with the fact that it was not necessary to use the\ntest to determine who was best qualified for promotion.\n",
