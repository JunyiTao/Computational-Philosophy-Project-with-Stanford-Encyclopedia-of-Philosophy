    "main_text": "Emotion Views || Love as Emotion Complex\n6. The Value and Justification of Love\n\nWhy do we love? It has been suggested above that any account of love\nneeds to be able to answer some such justificatory question. Although\nthe issue of the justification of love is important on its own, it is\nalso important for the implications it has for understanding more\nclearly the precise object of love: how can we make sense of the\nintuitions not only that we love the individuals themselves rather\nthan their properties, but also that my beloved is not\nfungible\u2014that no one could simply take her place without loss.\nDifferent theories approach these questions in different ways, but, as\nwill become clear below, the question of justification is primary.\n\nOne way to understand the question of why we love is as asking for\nwhat the value of love is: what do we get out of it? One kind of\nanswer, which has its roots in Aristotle, is that having loving\nrelationships promotes self-knowledge insofar as your beloved acts as\na kind of mirror, reflecting your character back to you (Badhwar,\n2003, p. 58). Of course, this answer presupposes that we cannot\naccurately know ourselves in other ways: that left alone, our sense of\nourselves will be too imperfect, too biased, to help us grow and\nmature as persons. The metaphor of a mirror also suggests that our\nbeloveds will be in the relevant respects similar to us, so that\nmerely by observing them, we can come to know ourselves better in a\nway that is, if not free from bias, at least more objective than\notherwise.\n\nBrink (1999, pp. 264\u201365) argues that there are serious limits to\nthe value of such mirroring of one\u2019s self in a beloved. For if\nthe aim is not just to know yourself better but to improve\nyourself, you ought also to interact with others who are not just like\nyourself: interacting with such diverse others can help you recognize\nalternative possibilities for how to live and so better assess the\nrelative merits of these possibilities. Whiting (2013) also emphasizes\nthe importance of our beloveds\u2019 having an independent voice\ncapable of reflecting not who one now is but an ideal for who one is\nto be. Nonetheless, we need not take the metaphor of the mirror quite\nso literally; rather, our beloveds can reflect our selves not through\ntheir inherent similarity to us but rather through the interpretations\nthey offer of us, both explicitly and implicitly in their responses to\nus. This is what Badhwar calls the \u201cepistemic\nsignificance\u201d of\n love.[16]\n\nIn addition to this epistemic significance of love, LaFollette (1996,\nChapter 5) offers several other reasons why it is good to love,\nreasons derived in part from the psychological literature on love:\nlove increases our sense of well-being, it elevates our sense of\nself-worth, and it serves to develop our character. It also, we might\nadd, tends to lower stress and blood pressure and to increase health\nand longevity. Friedman (1993) argues that the kind of partiality\ntowards our beloveds that love involves is itself morally\nvaluable because it supports relationships\u2014loving\nrelationships\u2014that contribute \u201cto human well-being,\nintegrity, and fulfillment in life\u201d (p. 61). And Solomon (1988,\np. 155) claims:\n\nUltimately, there is only one reason for love. That one grand\nreason\u2026is \u201cbecause we bring out the best in each\nother.\u201d What counts as \u201cthe best,\u201d of course, is\nsubject to much individual variation.\n\n\nThis is because, Solomon suggests, in loving someone, I want myself to\nbe better so as to be worthy of his love for me.\n\nEach of these answers to the question of why we love understands it to\nbe asking about love quite generally, abstracted away from details of\nparticular relationships. It is also possible to understand the\nquestion as asking about particular loves. Here, there are several\nquestions that are relevant:\n\nWhat, if anything, justifies my loving rather than not loving this particular person?\nWhat, if anything, justifies my coming to love this particular person rather than someone else?\nWhat, if anything, justifies my continuing to love this particular person given the changes\u2014both in him and me and in the overall circumstances\u2014that have occurred since I began loving him?\n\n\nThese are importantly different questions. Velleman (1999), for\nexample, thinks we can answer (1) by appealing to the fact that my\nbeloved is a person and so has a rational nature, yet he thinks (2)\nand (3) have no answers: the best we can do is offer causal\nexplanations for our loving particular people, a position echoed by\nHan (2021). Setiya (2014) similarly thinks (1) has an answer, but\npoints not to the rational nature of persons but rather to the\nother\u2019s humanity, where such humanity differs from\npersonhood in that not all humans need have the requisite rational\nnature for personhood, and not all persons need be humans. And, as\nwill become clear\n below,\n the distinction between (2) and (3) will become important in\nresolving puzzles concerning whether our beloveds are fungible, though\nit should be clear that (3) potentially raises questions concerning\n personal identity\n (which will not be addressed here).\n\nIt is important not to misconstrue these justificatory questions.\n Thomas (1991),\n for example, rejects the idea that love can be justified:\n\u201cthere are no rational considerations whereby anyone can lay\nclaim to another\u2019s love or insist that an individual\u2019s\nlove for another is irrational\u201d (p. 474). This is because,\nThomas claims (p. 471):\n\nno matter how wonderful and lovely an individual might be, on any and\nall accounts, it is simply false that a romantically unencumbered\nperson must love that individual on pain of being irrational. Or,\nthere is no irrationality involved in ceasing to love a person whom\none once loved immensely, although the person has not changed.\n\n\nHowever, as LaFollette (1996, p. 63) correctly points out,\n\nreason is not some external power which dictates how we should behave,\nbut an internal power, integral to who we are.\u2026 Reason does not\ncommand that we love anyone. Nonetheless, reason is vital in\ndetermining whom we love and why we love them.\n\n\nThat is, reasons for love are pro tanto: they are a part of\nthe overall reasons we have for acting, and it is up to us in\nexercising our capacity for agency to decide what on balance we have\nreason to do or even whether we shall act contrary to our reasons. To\nconstrue the notion of a reason for love as compelling us to love, as\nThomas does, is to misconstrue the place such reasons have within our\n agency.[17]\n\nMost philosophical discussions of the justification of love focus on\nquestion\n (1),\n thinking that answering this question will also, to the extent that\nwe can, answer question\n (2),\n which is typically not distinguished from\n (3).\n The answers given to these questions vary in a way that turns on how\nthe kind of evaluation implicit in love is construed. On the one hand,\nthose who understand the evaluation implicit in love to be a matter of\nthe bestowal of value (such as Telfer 1970\u201371; Friedman 1993;\nSinger 1994) typically claim that no justification can be given (cf.\n Section 4.2).\n As indicated above, this seems problematic, especially given the\nimportance love can have both in our lives and, especially, in shaping\nour identities as persons. To reject the idea that we can love for\nreasons may reduce the impact our agency can have in defining who we\nare.\n\nOn the other hand, those who understand the evaluation implicit in\nlove to be a matter of appraisal tend to answer the justificatory\nquestion by appeal to these valuable properties of the beloved. This\nacceptance of the idea that love can be justified leads to two\nfurther, related worries about the object of love.\n\nThe\n first worry is raised by Vlastos (1981) in a discussion Plato\u2019s\nand Aristotle\u2019s accounts of love. Vlastos notes that these\naccounts focus on the properties of our beloveds: we are to\nlove people, they say, only because and insofar as they are\nobjectifications of the excellences. Consequently, he argues, in doing\nso they fail to distinguish \u201cdisinterested\naffection for the person we love\u201d from\n\u201cappreciation of the excellences instantiated by that\nperson\u201d (p. 33). That is, Vlastos thinks that Plato and\nAristotle provide an account of love that is really a love of\nproperties rather than a love of persons\u2014love of a type\nof person, rather than love of a particular person\u2014thereby\nlosing what is distinctive about love as an essentially\npersonal attitude. This worry about Plato and Aristotle might\nseem to apply just as well to other accounts that justify love in\nterms of the properties of the person: insofar as we love the person\nfor the sake of her properties, it might seem that what we love is\nthose properties and not the person. Here it is surely insufficient to\nsay, as Solomon (1988, p. 154) does, \u201cif love has its reasons,\nthen it is not the whole person that one loves but certain aspects of\nthat person\u2014though the rest of the person comes along too, of\ncourse\u201d: that final tagline fails to address the central\ndifficulty about what the object of love is and so about love as a\ndistinctly personal attitude. (Clausen 2019 might seem to address this\nworry by arguing that we love people not as having certain properties\nbut rather as having \u201corganic unities\u201d: a\nholistic set of properties the value of each of which must be\nunderstood in essential part in terms of its place within that whole.\nNonetheless, while this is an interesting and plausible way to think\nabout the value of the properties of persons, that organic unity\nitself will be a (holistic) property held by the person, and it seems\nthat the fundamental problem reemerges at the level of this holistic\nproperty: do we love the holistic unity rather than the person?)\n\nThe second worry concerns the fungibility of the object of love. To be\nfungible is to be replaceable by another relevantly similar\nobject without any loss of value. Thus, money is fungible: I can give\nyou two $5 bills in exchange for a $10 bill, and neither of us has\nlost anything. Is the object of love fungible? That is, can I simply\nswitch from loving one person to loving another relevantly similar\nperson without any loss? The worry about fungibility is commonly put\nthis way: if we accept that love can be justified by appealing to\nproperties of the beloved, then it may seem that in loving someone for\ncertain reasons, I love him not simply as the individual he is, but as\ninstantiating those properties. And this may imply that any other\nperson instantiating those same properties would do just as well: my\nbeloved would be fungible. Indeed, it may be that another person\nexhibits the properties that ground my love to a greater degree than\nmy current beloved does, and so it may seem that in such a case I have\nreason to \u201ctrade up\u201d\u2014to switch my love to the new,\nbetter person. However, it seems clear that the objects of our loves\nare not fungible: love seems to involve a deeply personal commitment\nto a particular person, a commitment that is antithetical to the idea\nthat our beloveds are fungible or to the idea that we ought to be\nwilling to trade up when\n possible.[18]\n\nIn\n responding to these worries, Nozick (1989) appeals to the union view\nof love he endorses (see the section on\n Love as Union):\n\nThe intention in love is to form a we and to identify with it\nas an extended self, to identify one\u2019s fortunes in large part\nwith its fortunes. A willingness to trade up, to destroy the very\nwe you largely identify with, would then be a willingness to\ndestroy your self in the form of your own extended self. [p. 78]\n\n\nSo it is because love involves forming a \u201cwe\u201d that we must\nunderstand other persons and not properties to be the objects of love,\nand it is because my very identity as a person depends essentially on\nthat \u201cwe\u201d that it is not possible to substitute without\nloss one object of my love for another. However, Badhwar (2003)\ncriticizes Nozick, saying that his response implies that once I love\nsomeone, I cannot abandon that love no matter who that person becomes;\nthis, she says, \u201ccannot be understood as love at all rather than\naddiction\u201d (p.\n 61).[19]\n\nInstead, Badhwar (1987) turns to her robust-concern account of love as\na concern for the beloved for his sake rather than\none\u2019s own. Insofar as my love is disinterested \u2014\nnot a means to antecedent ends of my own\u2014it would be senseless\nto think that my beloved could be replaced by someone who is able to\nsatisfy my ends equally well or better. Consequently, my beloved is in\nthis way irreplaceable. However, this is only a partial response to\nthe worry about fungibility, as Badhwar herself seems to acknowledge.\nFor the concern over fungibility arises not merely for those cases in\nwhich we think of love as justified instrumentally, but also for those\ncases in which the love is justified by the intrinsic value of the\nproperties of my beloved. Confronted with cases like this, Badhwar\n(2003) concludes that the object of love is fungible after all (though\nshe insists that it is very unlikely in practice). (Soble (1990,\nChapter 13) draws similar conclusions.)\n\nNonetheless, Badhwar thinks that the object of love is\n\u201cphenomenologically non-fungible\u201d (2003, p. 63; see also\n1987, p. 14). By this she means that we experience our\nbeloveds to be irreplaceable: \u201cloving and delighting in [one\nperson] are not completely commensurate with loving and delighting in\nanother\u201d (1987, p. 14). Love can be such that we sometimes\ndesire to be with this particular person whom we love, not another\nwhom we also love, for our loves are qualitatively different. But why\nis this? It seems as though the typical reason I now want to spend\ntime with Amy rather than Bob is, for example, that Amy is funny but\nBob is not. I love Amy in part for her humor, and I love Bob for other\nreasons, and these qualitative differences between them is what makes\nthem not fungible. However, this reply does not address the worry\nabout the possibility of trading up: if Bob were to be at least as\nfunny (charming, kind, etc.) as Amy, why shouldn\u2019t I dump her\nand spend all my time with him?\n\nA somewhat different approach is taken by Whiting (1991). In response\nto the first worry concerning the object of love, Whiting argues that\nVlastos offers a false dichotomy: having affection for someone that is\ndisinterested\u2014for her sake rather than my\nown\u2014essentially involves an appreciation of her excellences as\nsuch. Indeed, Whiting says, my appreciation of these as excellences,\nand so the underlying commitment I have to their value, just\nis a disinterested commitment to her because these\nexcellences constitute her identity as the person she is. The person,\ntherefore, really is the object of love. Delaney (1996) takes the\ncomplementary tack of distinguishing between the object of\none\u2019s love, which of course is the person, and the\ngrounds of the love, which are her properties: to say, as\nSolomon does, that we love someone for reasons is not at all to say\nthat we only love certain aspects of the person. In these terms, we\nmight say that Whiting\u2019s rejection of Vlastos\u2019 dichotomy\ncan be read as saying that what makes my attitude be one of\ndisinterested affection\u2014one of love\u2014for the\nperson is precisely that I am thereby responding to her excellences as\nthe reasons for that\n affection.[20]\n\nOf course, more needs to be said about what it is that makes a\nparticular person be the object of love. Implicit in Whiting\u2019s\naccount is an understanding of the way in which the object of my love\nis determined in part by the history of interactions I have with her:\nit is she, and not merely her properties (which might be instantiated\nin many different people), that I want to be with; it is she, and not\nmerely her properties, on whose behalf I am concerned when she suffers\nand whom I seek to comfort; etc. This addresses the first worry, but\nnot the second worry about fungibility, for the question still remains\nwhether she is the object of my love only as instantiating certain\nproperties, and so whether or not I have reason to \u201ctrade\nup.\u201d\n\nTo\n respond to the fungibility worry, Whiting and Delaney appeal\nexplicitly to the historical\n relationship.[21]\n Thus, Whiting claims, although there may be a relatively large pool\nof people who have the kind of excellences of character that would\njustify my loving them, and so although there can be no answer to\nquestion\n (2)\n about why I come to love this rather than that person within this\npool, once I have come to love this person and so have developed a\nhistorical relation with her, this history of concern justifies my\ncontinuing to love this person rather than someone else (1991, p. 7).\nSimilarly, Delaney claims that love is grounded in\n\u201chistorical-relational properties\u201d (1996, p. 346), so that\nI have reasons for continuing to love this person rather than\nswitching allegiances and loving someone else. In each case, the\nappeal to both such historical relations and the excellences of\ncharacter of my beloved is intended to provide an answer to question\n (3),\n and this explains why the objects of love are not fungible.\n\nThere seems to be something very much right with this response.\nRelationships grounded in love are essentially personal, and it would\nbe odd to think of what justifies that love to be merely\nnon-relational properties of the beloved. Nonetheless, it is still\nunclear how the historical-relational propreties can provide any\nadditional justification for subsequent concern beyond that which is\nalready provided (as an answer to question\n (1))\n by appeal to the excellences of the beloved\u2019s character (cf.\nBrink 1999). The mere fact that I have loved someone in the past does\nnot seem to justify my continuing to love him in the future.\nWhen we imagine that he is going through a rough time and begins to\nlose the virtues justifying my initial love for him, why\nshouldn\u2019t I dump him and instead come to love someone new having\nall of those virtues more fully? Intuitively (unless the change she\nundergoes makes her in some important sense no longer the same person\nhe was), we think I should not dump him, but the appeal to the mere\nfact that I loved him in the past is surely not enough. Yet what\nhistorical-relational properties could do the trick? (For an\ninteresting attempt at an answer, see Kolodny 2003 and also Howard\n2019.)\n\nIf we think that love can be justified, then it may seem that the\nappeal to particular historical facts about a loving relationship to\njustify that love is inadequate, for such idiosyncratic and subjective\nproperties might explain but cannot justify love.\nRather, it may seem, justification in general requires appealing to\nuniversal, objective properties. But such properties are ones that\nothers might share, which leads to the problem of fungibility.\nConsequently it may seem that love cannot be justified. In the face of\nthis predicament, accounts of love that understand love to be an\nattitude towards value that is intermediate between appraisal and\nbestowal, between recognizing already existing value and creating that\nvalue (see\n Section 4.3)\n might seem to offer a way out. For once we reject the thought that\nthe value of our beloveds must be either the precondition or the\nconsequence of our love, we have room to acknowledge that the deeply\npersonal, historically grounded, creative nature of love (central to\nbestowal accounts) and the understanding of love as responsive to\nvaluable properties of the beloved that can justify that love (central\nto appraisal accounts) are not mutually exclusive (Helm 2010; Bagley\n2015).\n",
