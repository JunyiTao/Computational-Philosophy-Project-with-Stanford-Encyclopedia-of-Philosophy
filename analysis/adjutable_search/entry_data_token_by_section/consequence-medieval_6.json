    "main_text": "14th Century Theories of Consequence || Burley and Ockham\n3.2 Burley and Ockham\n\nWalter Burley is the author of the oldest treatise on consequence with\nknown authorship (edited by Brown in 1980), but it is in his later\nwork De Puritate, longer version, that one finds his fully\ndeveloped theory of consequence (Archambault 2018b). The shorter version of De\nPuritate is thought to have been composed before Ockham\u2019s\nSumma Logicae, and contains only a section on consequence and\na section on syncategoremata. The received view is that,\nafter becoming acquainted with Ockham\u2019s Summa Logicae, Burley\nabandoned the text of what is now known as the shorter version of\nDe Puritate and began to work on a new draft, which was to\nbecome the longer version (Spade 2000). The theory of consequence\npresented in the shorter version is based on ten basic principles,\nfour of which are clearly sentential/propositional, while the other\nsix take terms as the basic logical unit (Boh 1982). The only\ndistinction of consequence that Burley discusses is that between\nsimple and as-of-now consequence, a traditional distinction which\nremained popular in the 14th century:\n\nFirst therefore I assume a certain distinction, namely this one: One\nkind of [consequence] is simple, another kind is as-of-now (ut\nnunc). A simple [consequence] is one that holds for every time.\nFor example \u2018A man runs; an animal runs.\u2019 An as-of-now\n[consequence] holds for a determinate time and not always. For example\n\u2018Every man runs; therefore, Socrates runs\u2019. For that\n[consequence] does not hold always, but only while Socrates is a man.\n(Burley, De Puritate, 3)\n\n\nThis temporal understanding of the simple vs. as-of-now distinction is\nthe one adopted by most authors, both before and after Burley\n(however, see Pseudo-Scotus\u2019 formulation, discussed in the next\nsection), and is repeated verbatim in the longer version of On the\nPurity\u2026 (p. 146). Another interesting feature of the\nshorter version is the fact that it treats syllogisms under the\nconcept of consequence, thus illustrating the absorption of\nsyllogistic by theories of consequences in the 14th\ncentury. Burley\u2019s mature theory of consequence, as presented in the\nlonger version of De Puritate, is best discussed against the\nbackground of the theory of consequence presented in Ockham\u2019s\nSumma Logicae, so let us now turn to Ockham first.\n\nOckham\u2019s Summa Logicae is thought to date to the first years\nof the 1320s; section 3 of Part III is entirely dedicated to\nconsequences. In chapter 1 of III-3, Ockham presents a somewhat\nconfusing account of consequences based on nine distinctions,\nincluding the simple vs. as-of-now distinction; the distinction\nbetween formal and material consequence is the last one\n presented.[9]\n It seems that this important distinction was discussed systematically\nfor the first time in this very text (Martin 2005), but Ockham offers\nvirtually no justification for his use of the notions of form and\nmatter with respect to consequences. It is also possible that Ockham\ndeliberately ignores the well-entrenched distinction between natural\nand accidental consequences, given that he mentions nine\ndistinctions, but not this one. Here is how Ockham introduces the\nnotion of a formal consequence:\n\nFormal consequences are of two kinds. Some hold in virtue of an\nextrinsic middle, which concerns the form of propositions. For\nexample, such rules as \u2018from an exclusive to a universal, with\ntransposition of terms, is a good consequence\u2019; \u2018if the\nmajor premise is necessary and the minor premise is assertoric (de\ninesse), the conclusion is necessary\u2019. Others hold\nimmediately in virtue of an intrinsic middle, and mediately in virtue\nof an extrinsic middle regarding the general conditions of the\nproposition, [\u2026] such as in \u2018Socrates is not running,\ntherefore a man is not running.\u2019 (William of Ockham, Summa\nLogicae III-3, ch. 1, lines 45\u201354)\n\n\nThus, according to Ockham, formal consequences are those that hold in\nvirtue of middles, be they intrinsic or extrinsic. A\nconsequence holds immediately in virtue of an intrinsic middle when it\nholds in virtue of the truth of a different sentence formed from its\nterms. For example, \u2018Socrates is not running, therefore a man is\nnot running\u2019 holds in virtue of this middle: \u2018Socrates is\na man\u2019, since if \u2018Socrates is a man\u2019 is not true,\nthe consequence does not hold. These are typically enthymematic\nconsequences, i.e. consequences with a \u2018missing premise\u2019\n(with the additional premise, they become a valid syllogism). An\nextrinsic middle, by contrast, is a sentence not containing the terms\nthat form the antecedent and the consequent of the putative\nconsequence, but which is a general rule describing the\n\u2018fact\u2019 that warrants the passage from the antecedent to\nthe consequent (reminiscent of Boethius\u2019 maximal propositions), and\nwhich concerns the form of sentences. Ockham\u2019s example of a\nconsequence holding immediately in virtue of an extrinsic middle is\n\u2018Only a man is a donkey, therefore every donkey is a man\u2019,\nwhich holds in virtue of this general rule: \u2018an exclusive and a\nuniversal with transposed terms signify the same and are\nconvertible\u2019.\n\nNotice however that \u2018Socrates is not running, therefore a man is\nnot running\u2019 and \u2018Only a man is a donkey, therefore every\ndonkey is a man\u2019 are both formal consequences for\nOckham (since both hold in virtue of middles), whereas the former is\nclearly an enthymeme, not valid in all substitutional instances of the\nterms \u2018Socrates\u2019, \u2018man\u2019, and\n\u2018running\u2019, thus not satisfying (ST) (see (Crimi 2018) on the extensional discrepancy between Ockham\u2019s notion of formal consequence and Buridan\u2019s (ST)-based notion of formal consequence). The latter, on the\nother hand, is valid in all substitutional instances of\n\u2018donkey\u2019 and \u2018man\u2019, and indeed this seems to\nbe the case of most, if not all, of Ockham\u2019s formal consequences\nimmediately valid in virtue of extrinsic middles; he explicitly says\nfor example that syllogisms are of the latter kind. Effectively,\nformal consequences immediately valid in virtue of extrinsic middles\nsatisfy the (ST) criterion of being valid \u2018in all matter\u2019,\nbut the same does not hold of Ockham\u2019s (enthymematic) consequences\nvalid in virtue of an intrinsic middle.\n\nCuriously, while Ockham can be credited with having been the first to\nuse the terms \u2018formal consequence\u2019 and \u2018material\nconsequence\u2019 systematically, the content of his\ndistinction did not pass on to later authors. This is arguably because\nOckham\u2019s distinction is cast in terms of intrinsic and extrinsic\nmiddles, peculiar concepts belonging to the Boethian framework which\nwas already losing its influence by Ockham\u2019s time (Green-Pedersen\n1984). Indeed, one seldom encounters the concept of\n\u2018middles\u2019 in writings of the post-Ockham period, except\nfor texts under his direct influence.\n\nAs for material consequences, it is not entirely clear how exactly\nOckham intended to define this class of consequences. He says that\nmaterial consequences are those that hold in virtue solely of (the\nmeaning of) their terms (Ockham, Summa Logicae III-3, ch. 1,\nlines 55\u201357) but the two examples he gives are of a consequence\nwith an impossible antecedent and a consequence with a necessary\nconsequent. This suggests the reading that this category consists\nexclusively of consequences of this sort (ex impossibili and\nad necessarium consequences), but there is no conclusive\nevidence supporting this interpretation; in particular, he did not\noffer any explicit motivation for his use of the concept of\nmatter to characterize this class of\n consequences.[10]\n\nAs mentioned above, the longer version of Burley\u2019s De\nPuritate is thought to be largely a response to Ockham\u2019s\nSumma Logicae, not exclusively but also with respect to\nconsequence. Burley recovers the natural vs. accidental distinction\nwhich had been deliberately neglected by Ockham (Archambault 2018b), but in fact\nformulates it with a terminology similar to that used by Ockham for\nformal consequences, namely in terms of the concepts of intrinsic and\nextrinsic topics (rather than \u2018middles\u2019, but this appears\nto be above all a mere terminological difference):\n\nSimple [consequence] is of two kinds. One is natural. That happens\nwhen the antecedent includes the consequent. Such an inference holds\nthrough an intrinsic topic. An accidental inference is one that holds\nthrough an extrinsic topic. That happens when the antecedent does not\ninclude the consequent but the inference holds through a certain\nextrinsic rule. (Burley, De Puritate, 146)\n\n\nNotice again the reference to the idea that the antecedent may\ninclude/contain the consequent (in natural consequences). One may\nconjecture that Burley sought to neutralize Ockham\u2019s distinction\nbetween formal and material consequences in terms of intrinsic and\nextrinsic middles by formulating the traditional distinction between\nnatural and accidental consequences in terms of containment and\nintrinsic/extrinsic topics. Moreover, when discussing the notion of\nformal consequence later in the text (pp. 171\u2013173, replying to a\npossible objection), Burley seems to be criticizing Ockham\u2019s\ndefinition of material consequences as those which hold solely in\nvirtue of the meaning of terms:\n\nThus for a [consequence] to hold by reason of the terms can happen in\ntwo ways, either because it holds materially by reason of the terms,\nor because it holds formally by reason of the terms \u2014 that is,\nby the formal reason of the terms. (Burley, On the\nPurity, 173)\n\n\nIn other words, Burley seems to be saying that Ockham\u2019s formulation of\nthe distinction is ineffective and thus inadequate. The exact\nformulation of the distinction between formal and material\nconsequences presented by Ockham was indeed not adopted by later\nauthors, but it would be excessively speculative to attribute this\noutcome to Burley\u2019s criticism. In effect, even less of a Burleian\nlegacy is to be found in later authors specifically with respect to\nconsequence, in particular as the formal vs. material distinction\nbecame the main subdivision of consequence later on (albeit under\ndifferent formulations).\n",
