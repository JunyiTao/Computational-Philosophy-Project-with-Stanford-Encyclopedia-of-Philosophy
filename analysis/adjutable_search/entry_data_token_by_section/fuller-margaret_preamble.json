    "main_text": "\n\nMargaret Fuller (1810\u20131850), one of the most important American\nfeminists of her day, was a philosopher, journalist, and literary\ncritic. She belonged to the New England intellectual community called\nthe transcendentalists, who also included Ralph Waldo Emerson and\nHenry David Thoreau. Her most important written work is Woman in\nthe Nineteenth Century (1845), an expansion of her article\nentitled \u201cThe Great Lawsuit: Man versus Men, Woman\nversus Women\u201d (1843). Fuller is remembered not only for\nher writings, but also for her life: a series of undertakings to live\nup to her own ideal of transcending the then customary gender\ndifferentiations. This article will present a summary of her\nphilosophy and also take note of the various ways in which she sought\n(or did not seek) to implement her philosophical ideals.\n",
