    "main_text": "A complete worldview: metaphysics, taxonomies, cosmology || A reasoned anthropocentrism\n2.3 A reasoned anthropocentrism\n\nJaina thinkers excel in developing lengthy and highly technical\nclassifications. A core classification is the taxonomy that\ndistinguishes the types of embodied selves according to the number of\nsenses they possess. This taxonomy has retained its importance for\ncontemporary practitioners, notably because it defines the extent of\ndemerit acquired when one actually harms a living being.\n\nThere, the first category gathers all the living beings possessing\nonly one sense, namely that of touch. This concerns either plants, or\nthe elemental selves which gets embodied in an atom of earth, of\nwater, of fire, or of air, either gross or subtle. In consequence,\nthere are souls also in things such as stones and metals. However, it\nis not always the case that a self gets embodied in these atoms. When\nthere is no self in it, the atom is purely inanimate matter, unable to\nsuffer. In opposition to this, each plant or animal is necessarily the\nhost of a self, this is what makes it alive. Concerning plants, some\ncan also be the host of several selves, as in the case of moss. This\nalso concerns the most basic life form, called\n\u201cnigoda\u201d, \u201cidle\u201d, and which consists\nin clusters of minute beings with little hope for liberation. They can\nbe found everywhere, including in air, tissues of plants, or flesh of\nanimals. The offense must be strong for a self once embodied in a\nhuman being to get embodied as a nigoda. One famous example\nis that of Makkhali Go\u015b\u0101la, leader of the heretic\n\u0100j\u012bvika movement, who was disrespectful and challenged\nMah\u0101v\u012bra. Furthermore, if a plant dies, its self\ntransmigrates and gets re-embodied in another, more or less subtle,\nbody. In this case, the body of the plant is not alive anymore, but it\nis still inhabited by the selves of the bacteria that work towards its\ndecomposition. To conclude on one-sensed beings, they possess the\nsense of touch. This means that they cannot see, hear, smell, taste,\nnor think, but they have a minimal conscious activity in the form of\nthe tactile experience. Besides, even in a crude not developed way,\nthey can already experience pleasure and pain.\n\nNext to the one-sensed beings are all the animals. First, worms and\nevery being in their category, like leeches, mollusks, or a type of\nphytophagous beetles, are two-sensed beings, possessing both touch and\ntaste. Then, ants and all the beings in their category, like\nphytophagous insects, termites and millipedes, are three-sensed\nbeings, and are also able to smell. They are followed by the\nfour-sensed beings who can also see, like bees and similar beings as\nflies, mosquitoes, butterflies or scorpions. Finally, human beings and\nall the beings in their category, like fish, reptiles, birds,\nquadrupeds, demons and gods, are five-sensed beings, enjoying touch,\ntaste, smell, sight, and hearing. Amongst them, some also have an\nintellect (manas), considered by some authors as a sixth\nsense.\n\nIt is interesting to note that the English expression\n\u201canimal\u201d denotes what is animated, what has a soul. While\nin Jainism, what is animated, what has a soul (j\u012bva),\nalso includes the immobile plants and elemental beings. In this\nconception, the Sanskrit expression for animal is\n\u201ctirya\u00f1c-\u201d, \u201cwhat is able to cross a\nspatial area\u201d.\n\nIt is hard to understand what is not alive in this system. Therefore,\nacting in a non-harmful way is close to non-acting. In practice, while\nthe lay community should avoid harming the beings with two or more\nsenses, the monastic community is supposed to also avoid harming the\none-sensed beings. With such a norm of action, monks and nuns cannot\ncook, nor perform a range of acts necessary for their survival. From\nthis, a system of redistribution of merit and demerit is developed for\nthe lay people, who perform some violent acts for their survival, but\nare redeemed in providing the means to live to the monastic\ncommunity.\n",
