    "main_text": "\n\nMedieval theories of analogy were a response to problems in three\nareas: logic, theology, and metaphysics. Logicians were concerned with\nthe use of words having more than one sense, whether completely\ndifferent, or related in some way. Theologians were concerned with\nlanguage about God. How can we speak about a transcendent, totally\nsimple spiritual being without altering the sense of the words we use?\nMetaphysicians were concerned with talk about reality. How can we say\nthat both substances (e.g., Socrates) and accidents (e.g., the\nbeardedness of Socrates) exist when one is dependent on the other; how\ncan we say that both God and creatures exist, when one is created by\nthe other? Medieval thinkers reacted to these three problems by\ndeveloping a theory which divided words into three sorts,\nindependently of context. Some were univocal (always used with the\nsame sense), some were purely equivocal (used with quite different\nsenses), and some were analogical (used with related senses).\nAnalogical terms were thought to be particularly useful in metaphysics\nand theology, but they were routinely discussed in commentaries on\nAristotle\u2019s logic and in logic textbooks. The background to the\ndiscussion was given by what is often called the analogy of being or\nmetaphysical analogy, the doctrine that reality is divided both\nhorizontally into the very different realities of substances and\naccidents and vertically into the very different realities of God and\ncreatures, and that these realities are analogically related.\nNonetheless, the phrase \u201cmedieval theories of analogy\u201d as\nused here will refer to semantic analogy, a set of linguistic and\nlogical doctrines supplemented, at least from the fourteenth century\non, by doctrines about the nature of human concepts.\n\nThere were three main types of semantic analogy, each based on a type\nof metaphysical analogy. In the original Greek sense, analogy involved\na comparison of two proportions or relations. Thus\n\u2018principle\u2019 was said to be an analogical term when said of\na point and a spring of water because a point is related to a line as\na spring is related to a river. This type of analogy came to be called\nthe analogy of proportionality. In the second sense, analogy involved\na relation between two things, of which one is primary and the other\nsecondary. Thus \u2018healthy\u2019 was said to be an analogical\nterm when said of a dog and its food because while the dog has health\nin the primary sense, its food is healthy only secondarily as\ncontributing to or causing the health of the dog. This second type of\nanalogy became known as the analogy of attribution, and its special\nmark was being said in a prior and a posterior sense (per prius et\nposterius). A third type of analogy, sometimes used by\ntheologians, appealed to a relation of likeness between God and\ncreatures. Creatures are called good or just because their goodness or\njustice imitates or reflects the goodness or justice of God. This type\nof analogy was called the analogy of imitation or participation. Of\nthe three types, it is the analogy of attribution that is central to\nmedieval discussions.\n\nFrom the fourteenth century on discussions of analogy focused not so\nmuch on linguistic usages as on the nature of the concepts that\ncorresponded to the words used. Is there just one concept that\ncorresponds to an analogical term, or is there a sequence of concepts?\nIf the latter, how are the members of the sequence ordered and related\nto each other? Moreover, how far should we distinguish between\nso-called formal concepts (or acts of mind) and objective concepts\n(whatever it is that is the object of the act of understanding)? These\ndiscussions were still influential at the time of Descartes.\n",
