    "main_text": "Types of Argumentation || Conclusion\n3.5 Conclusion\n\nFrom these observations on different types of argumentation, a\npluralistic picture emerges: argumentation, understood as the exchange\nof reasons to justify claims, seems to have different applications in\ndifferent situations. However, it is not clear that some of the goals\noften attributed to argumentation such as epistemic improvement and\nreaching consensus can in fact be reliably achieved in many real life\nsituations. Does this mean that argumentation is useless and futile?\nNot necessarily, but it may mean that engaging in argumentation will\nnot always be the optimal response in a number of contexts.\n",
