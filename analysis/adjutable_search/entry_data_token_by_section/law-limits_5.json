The Morality of Legal Moralism\n\nAs we have seen, Devlin took homosexuality and animal cruelty to be\nmorally wrongful and therefore his reason for supporting the\ndecriminalization of the first and the continued criminalization of\nthe second was that they, respectively, ought to be tolerated and\nought not to be tolerated (see footnote 5). Notably neither Devlin nor\nHart addressed the question of why\u2014in virtue of what\u2014can\nit be asserted or denied that homosexuality is morally wrongful. For\nDevlin that is hardly to the point, for \u201cwhat the law maker has\nto ascertain is not the true belief but the common\nbelief\u201d(Devlin 1965: 94). By contrast Devlin\u2019s fellow\nlegal moralist, Moore, would take Devlin\u2019s support for\ndecriminalization of homosexual sex to be the right result for the\nwrong reason; homosexuality, not being in any way morally\nwrong, should not be criminalized for that straightforward reason; the\nquestion of toleration should never arise (Moore 1997: 756; Corvino\n2013; Pickett 2020).\n\nDevlin\u2019s account is a moral relativist one. He relativizes what\nis morally good to the beliefs of a given society (where \u201cdeeply\nfelt and not manufactured\u201d; Devlin 1965: 17). The attraction for\nDevlin of moral relativism was his belief that it would yield a\nmorality generally of the society subject to it, without\nconceding \u201cmoral expertise\u201d to any (elite) group of\npersons. He seemed to assimilate the \u201crationalist\nmorality\u201d he rejected to the views of an educated elite (Devlin\n1965:\n 91\u201392).[8]\n Since Hart\u2019s critique, few have found the relativist aspect of\nDevlin\u2019s account convincing (Hart 1963 [1982: 17\u201324]).\nDevlin\u2019s view appears to exemplify what Bernard Williams styled\nas \u201cvulgar and unregenerate\u201d relativism (B. Williams 1972:\n34, cf. Fricker 2013). Such relativism\u2014as Williams paints\nit\u2014is composed of three propositions:\n\n\n1.\n\u201cright\u201d means \u2026 \u201cright for a given\nsociety\u201d [also presumably by the same token: \u201cwrong\u201d\nmeans \u201cwrong for a given society\u201d];\n2.\nright[/wrong] \u201cfor a given society\u201d is to be\nunderstood in the functionalist sense\u2019 [i.e., for the\npersistence of that society]; and that\n3.\n(therefore) it is wrong for people in one society to condemn,\ninterfere with, etc., the values of another society.\n\u00a0\n(B. Williams 1972: 34\u201339, numbering added; cf. the\ndistinction between \u201cpositive morality\u201d and\n\u201ccritical morality\u201d in Hart 1963 [1982: 17\u201324])\n\n\n\nAs noted above, Devlin affirmed the first of William\u2019s\npropositions. In industrialized societies, Devlin tells us, it is\ngenerally true that monogamy \u201cis built into the house in which\nwe live and could not be removed without bringing it down\u201d\n(Devlin 1965: 10). But this is merely a contingent truth and if our\nhouses were built differently\u2014around polygamy\u2014the content\nof the law to be enforced could legitimately be the opposite of what\nit is (Devlin 1965: 114). As for the second, it is equally clear that\nDevlin understood wrongness \u201cfor a given society\u201d in\n\u201cthe functional sense\u201d of what threatened the persistence\nof that society. A society is constituted by its \u201ccommon\nmorality\u201d or \u201cmoral structure\u201d or \u201cpublic\nmorality\u201d and its morality is as necessary to it as \u201ca\nrecognised government\u201d, If a society\u2019s morality is not\nsufficiently enforced the society will \u201cdisintegrate\u201d; and\nthe society accordingly has a right to defend itself against attacks\non that morality (Devlin 1965: 10).\n\nDevlin\u2019s \u201cdisintegration argument\u201d appears fatally\nwounded by Hart\u2019s initial criticism of it. As Hart puts it,\nDevlin moves\n\n\nfrom the acceptable proposition that some shared morality is\nessential to the existence of any society to the unacceptable\nproposition that a society is identical with its morality as that is\nat any given moment of its history, so that a change in its morality\nis tantamount to a destruction of society. (Hart 1963 [1982: 51])\n\n\nThe former claim is plausible if restricted to what Hobbes and Hume\ncharacterized as the moral minimum essential for social life:\n\n\nrules restraining the free use of violence and minimal forms of rules\nregarding honesty, promise-keeping, fair dealing, and property. (Hart\n1967 [1983: 258])\n\n\nIf these ceased to be enforced, it is likely that a different and more\ndangerous state-of-affairs would ensue; one might well say the\noriginal society had disintegrated. Hart can afford to concede this.\nSuch a Hobbesian-Humean minimum is accounted for by the harm principle\nDevlin rejects. Devlin\u2019s argument, however, needs the\ndisintegration thesis to apply more widely, potentially to every crime\nof a community, be that to homosexuality, animal cruelty, bigamy,\nincest etc (to \u201cevery jot and tittle\u201d as Hart puts it:\nHart 1967 [1983: 258]). These need to be protected on pain of the\ndisintegration of society. Since Devlin gives no empirical evidence\nlinking the destruction of past societies with the non-enforcement of\ntheir rules, this appears not to be an empirical\n claim.[9]\n But as a conceptual argument it is highly dubious. For as Hart\nsays\n\n\nTaken strictly, it would prevent us saying that the morality of a\ngiven society has changed, and would compel us instead to say that one\nsociety had disappeared and another one taken its place (Hart 1963\n[1982: 51\u201352])\n\n\nOnly a claim of this strength seems able to support Devlin\u2019s\nbelief that any deviation from a society\u2019s shared\nmorality is an existential threat to it.\n\nA different objection is this: to assimilate right and wrong with the\nquestion of a society\u2019s survival assumes that the survival of a\nspecific society is necessarily good. It may be true that if certain\nsteps are not taken, the society will disintegrate. Apartheid in South\nAfrica disintegrated. What if by a more sustained enforcement of its\ncentral racist elements it had managed to persist longer? Would this\ncontinued existence be underwritten by a moral right? Does anyone now\nowe the society the duty to restore the system or did such a duty lie\nfor a period after its disintegration? The suggestions are absurd. The\npoint of course is that some societies are so lacking in legitimacy\nthat it may be for the best that they disintegrate and are replaced.\nDevlin goes too far when he says \u201cWhat is important is not the\nquality of the creed but the strength of the belief in it\u201d\n(Devlin 1965: 114). While his concern was the use of legal coercion\nwithin a specific society rather than with criticism of other\nsocieties, Devlin also appeared to hold to the third of\nWilliams\u2019 propositions above in seeking to exclude standards\nexternal to the beliefs of the society. Legal moralism, then, surely\nneeds foundations other than those Devlin sought to provide.\n\nThis impression is buttressed by another concern about his account.\nFor what is the status and basis of liberty and\nprivacy, for example, in Devlin\u2019s account? As we have seen he\ntook them to be powerful enough to override certain immoralities in\ndetermining what should be criminalized. But what if the ordinary jury\nmember or person on the Clapham omnibus just does not care that much\nabout privacy or liberty? What if, say, they take the view that\nadultery should be criminalized never mind the very high cost to\nprivacy? Should privacy and liberty be simply downgraded as a result?\nThere is no indication that Devlin would accept such a conclusion or\neven that the possibility occurred to him. Similarly, Devlin took it\nthat the law should be \u201cperfectly impartial in matters of\nreligion\u201d and this seems in no way sensitive to whether or not\nthe ordinary member of society endorses such impartiality (Devlin\n1965: 62). He appears to take liberty and privacy and other defeaters\nas safeguards applicable independently of whether ordinary people\nwould accept their validity. In this he appears to have been simply\ninconsistent.\n\nWhat alternative foundations could legal moralism have if\nDevlin\u2019s brand of moral relativism is to be rejected? In the\nlight of Devlin\u2019s stress on wrongdoing as a prima facie\nground for legal coercion, one possibility might be an ethics of\nprima facie duty associated with W.D Ross (Ross 1930; Skelton\n2012). And of course, any of the other numerous theories of what makes\nwrong action wrong\u2014consequentialist, Kantian, natural law,\nrights-based, virtue ethics\u2014could potentially form such a\nfoundation (Timmons\n 2013).[10]\n Michael Moore combines his legal moralism with a strong version of\nmetaphysical realism (Moore 1997). Presumably, however, such strong\nmetaethical commitments can be bracketed for the more specific\nquestions raised by legal moralism. Jeremy Waldron for example\nsuggests that an anti-realist or quasi-realist view, positing moral\ntruth, albeit based ultimately on subjective sources \u201cinside our\nown attitudes, desires, and natures\u201d, could serve as well as an\nout-and-out realist view of Moore\u2019s variety (Waldron 1999: 171).\nAgain, while a legal moralist must surely reject a\n\u201cvulgar\u201d relativist view of Devlin\u2019s stripe, it may\nnot follow that a more sophisticated moral relativist grounding for\nlegal moralism could not be attempted (Wong 2006; Rovane 2013;\nVelleman 2015; cf. Fricker 2013). Indeed Duff\u2019s legal moralism\nis alleged by others to contain moral relativist commitments, a claim\nhe himself rejects (Moore 2014: 199; Tadros 2016a: 121\u2013128; Duff\n2018: 232)\n",
