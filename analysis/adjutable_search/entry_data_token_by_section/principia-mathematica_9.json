    "main_text": "Volume II || Prefatory Statement of Symbolic Conventions\n5.1 Prefatory Statement of Symbolic Conventions\n\nThe writing of this preface delayed the publication of the second\nvolume of PM, as Whitehead and Russell struggled over the\ncomplications it raised. The difficulties arise from the typical\nambiguity of terms and formulas of the theory of types. Every\nconstant, such as those for the numbers \\(0,1, \\ldots, \\aleph_0\\) will\nhave a definition relative to each type. Without assuming the Axiom of\nInfinity for individuals, there is no guarantee that a given constant\ndesignates a non-empty class in a given type. The preface introduces\nthe notion of \u201cformal numbers\u201d, which are to be\ninterpreted as belonging to a type that makes them not identical with\nthe \\(\\emptyset\\) for that type. Volume II begins with Part III,\n\u201cCardinal Arithmetic\u201d. The notions of cardinal numbers are\ndeveloped in full generality, extending to infinite cardinals.\nConsequently the theory of natural numbers, which are called\n\u201cInductive Cardinals\u201d in PM, is introduced with a series\nof definitions of special cases of notions that are first introduced\nin a general form applying to any numbers or classes. For example,\naddition of natural numbers, as in the famous proof that \\(1 + 1 = 2\\)\nin \u2217110\u00b704 is proved  for the special\ncase of the addition of classes that applies to cardinal numbers,\n\u2018\\(+_c\\)\u2019. The Summary to section A introduces the notion\nof homogenous cardinals, which are classes of similar classes\nwhose members are all of the same type. It is possible to define\nsimilarity between two classes \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) of distinct\ntypes say \\(\\tau\\) and \\(\\tau '\\), and cardinals are classified as\ndescending and ascending as the domain of the\nrelevant similarity relation is of a higher type than the range, and\nwhen of a lower type, respectively. The theory of cardinal numbers is\nstraightforward with homogenous cardinals, however the exceptions must\nbe kept in mind, as is evidenced in \u2217100.\n",
