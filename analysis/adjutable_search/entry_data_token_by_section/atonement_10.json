    "main_text": "How to Atone || Punishment\n2.7 Punishment\n\nThe relationship between punishment and atonement has been highly\ndisputed. Part of the dispute results from divergent understandings of\npunishment. For instance, Anselm says that justice requires that\nhumans who sin against God must either repay the honor they have taken\nfrom God (i.e., offer satisfaction), or suffer punishment (Anselm\nCur Deus Homo, CDH hereafter, 13). But punishment,\nin this case, would result in eternal damnation and God doesn\u2019t\nwant that end for his creatures. Satisfaction thus provides a way for\natonement, but punishment does not. Aquinas, however, seems to think\nthat sin must be atoned through penal compensation and acts of penance\nand reparation count as penal because they are imposed for sin and are\ninvoluntary in themselves, although people voluntarily accept them in\nthe circumstances when they desire to atone (see ST\nI-II.87.6). Satisfactions are thus punishments, on this view, and thus\nat least some punishments atone.\n\nAccording to contemporary western views of punishment, for an act to\ncount as punishment it must\n\nimpose some cost or hardship (which could amount to the loss of an\nopportunity or privilege),\nbe done intentionally by the punisher,\nbe imposed in response to what is believed to be a wrong act,\nbe imposed as a way of expressing condemnation or censure of the\nact, and\nbe performed by a recognized authority (see the entry on\n punishment).\n\n\nIn this sense, most acts of penance and reparation\u2014unless\nimposed by a recognized authority\u2014will not amount to punishment.\nTypical punishments, on this notion, include: fines, prison sentences,\nthe death penalty, court ordered community service, and time-outs\ndeclared by parents.\n\nCan punishments, understood in this sense, atone? Once again,\npunishments that are impositions of reparation, penance, and apology\ncan atone, for all the same reasons that they can atone when done on\ntheir own, independently of being imposed as punishment. However,\nthese actions appear to have less value as acts of atonement when\nundertaken merely as punishment than when undertaken voluntarily from\nthe\n heart.[21]\n When an action is undertaken merely as punishment, it does not (or\ndoes not clearly convey) any repentance, contrition, or\nremorse\u2014unlike (typically) when it is undertaken voluntarily\nindependent of an imposition of punishment. Thus, an essential\ningredient of atonement for moral reconciliation is absent in the\nformer case. Even worse, acts undertaken merely as punishment can\nhinder atonement by producing resentment, anger, and other attitudes\nthat hinder\n reconciliation.[22]\n\nWhat about punishments such as jail time, the death penalty, and other\nforms of enforced suffering such as lashings\u2014can these\npunishments atone? Rashdall (1907; 1920) and others have argued that\nthese practices, typically justified on retributive grounds, do not\natone as they do no good to the wrongdoer or the victim (aside from\nprotection from future harm), and do nothing to bring about any sort\nof reconciliation between the wrongdoer and victim. Indeed, for the\nreasons mentioned above, punishment can hinder reconciliation.\n\nDefenders of certain retributivist theories of punishment, such as\nwhat Craig (2020: 178) calls positive retributivism, can resist\nRashdall\u2019s argument as follows: wrongdoers morally should be\npunished, and so to make amends they must be punished, and since\natoning requires making amends, being punished atones. This view faces\na challenge: how can punishment be a way of atoning if punishment\ndoesn\u2019t even aim at reconciliation? How does the wrongdoer being\nimprisoned (for example) aim for any sort of reconciliation between\nthe wrongdoer and the victim?\n\nGarvey (1999), drawing on expressivist theories of punishment, offers\none answer to this question. A wrong action both harms and wrongs the\nvictim.\n\n\nThe harm of a crime is the material loss it causes\u2026the wrong of\na crime is the message of disrespect or dishonor it conveys. (Garvey\n1999: 1821)\n\n\nPunishment is our conventional means to, as a society, counter this\nmessage. The counter-message of punishment can thus bring about moral\nreconciliation by removing or repudiating the insult delivered by the\nwrong action. Moral reconciliation between the victim and wrongdoer\nrequires more than that society send a counter-message; it\nrequires that the wrongdoer send the counter-message. By\nvoluntarily submitting to just punishment, the wrongdoer makes the\npublic message sent by punishment his\n own.[23]\n\nThis defense of the atoning value of punishment, however, seems to\nimply that punishment is not absolutely necessary for making atonement\nsince there are many other ways a wrongdoer could clearly communicate\na repudiation of the insult delivered by their wrong action. Indeed,\napology, reparation, and acts of moral improvement can\u2014perhaps\neven more clearly\u2014communicate a repudiation of the insult\n(Radzik 2009: 44). However, in some cases it may be conditionally\nnecessary to be punished in order to atone\u2014for instance, if\nthere is a clearly established set of punishments that are taken to be\nthe way people should express repudiation of their wrong actions. In\nthese cases, refraining from accepting a just punishment due to you\nwould communicate a lack of repudiation.\n",
