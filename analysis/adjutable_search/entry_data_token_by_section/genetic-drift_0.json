Origins of the Concept of Genetic Drift\n\nAlthough Charles Darwin invoked \u201cchance\u201d in various ways\nin the Origin of Species (Beatty 1984), he seems not to have\nincluded a concept of drift in his account. He does note in passing\nthat\n\n\n[v]ariations neither useful nor injurious would not be affected by\nnatural selection, and would be left either a fluctuating element, as\nperhaps we see in certain polymorphic species, or would ultimately\nbecome fixed, owing to the nature of the organism and the nature of\nthe conditions. (Darwin 1872: 63; see similar claims on p. 120 and p.\n176)\n\n\nAs the reader will see, this is tantalizingly similar to contemporary\nconceptions of drift. But Darwin does not develop the idea further; in\nparticular, he does not tell us why the distributions of such\nvariations would be fluctuating over time or how it is that they would\nultimately become fixed. The first serious (and mathematical)\ntreatments of drift are usually traced to two of the founders of\npopulation genetics, Sewall Wright and R.A. Fisher, although neither\nclaimed to have developed the ideas behind drift (Beatty 1992). Wright\n(1951) credits John Gulick (1873) with the genesis of the idea whereas\nFisher (1922b) first discussed the idea as derived from the work of\nA.C. and A.L. Hagedoorn (1921), although Wright (1931a) cites the\nHagedoorns too. It is unclear who first uses the term\n\u201cdrift\u201d in this context; it appears as early as Wright\n(1929). So, let us briefly examine Gulick and the Hagedoorns in order\nto understand the origins of the term \u201cdrift\u201d.\n\nGulick (1873) points out that with natural selection, one can assume\nthat where different forms are found, different external conditions\nwill also be found (with the different forms having adapted over the\ncourse of generations to the different external conditions). However,\nthere seem to be cases (e.g., among snails) where the external\nconditions are very similar, yet the organismic forms are very\ndifferent. He notes that these species tend to occupy very small\nareas, even though there is reason to believe it is not because they\nlack the ability to migrate further. He then postulates a scenario:\nSuppose some members of a species migrate to a new area where they are\nfree from competition and largely separated from the original\npopulation. New variations will arise in the new population, but\nunless they are \u201cdecidedly malformed\u201d, they will persist.\nThe new population will thus come to differentiate itself from the\noriginal population (e.g., with new shades of color or with variations\nof shape), perhaps rapidly if there is a \u201cpreexisting tendency\nto rapid variation\u201d.\n\nSome points to note here that become relevant in later discussions of\ndrift: 1) Drift is described in contrast to natural selection. 2) The\nvariations increasing in the population are those that are neutral, or\nat least not severely deleterious. (Note that 1 and 2 are also present\nin the quote from Darwin above). 3) Drift is associated with small\npopulations (although it is not fully clear why). 4) Drift is\nassociated with the founding of a new population in a new area. 5)\nChanges in the population are the result of movements of organisms and\ntheir tendency to produce new variations, both of which are physical\nprocesses and not purely mathematical constructs (something that\nbecomes an issue in later debates). 6) The changes described are of\norganisms in a population.\n\nHagedoorn and Hagedoorn (1921) similarly point out that some traits of\norganisms are \u201ctrivial\u201d, i.e., \u201ccannot possibly be\naccounted for as useful\u201d, such as \u201cthe shape and\narrangement of small hairs on the seeds of some cereals\u201d (p.\n107). They likewise maintain that such traits, which can be stable\n(\u201cpure\u201d, i.e., fixed) within a species, cannot be the\nproduct of natural selection; instead, the Hagedoorns assert, they\nmust be \u201cdue to some process which accompanies selection\u201d\n(p. 108). The Hagedoorns then proceed to describe several ways in\nwhich variability in a population can be reduced: a new population is\nfounded which lacks some of the variability of the original\npopulation; a population is split in half (with the variability in the\ndaughter populations differing from each other and from the original);\nand \u201crandom sampling\u201d where even though the size of the\npopulation remains relatively constant from year to year, only a small\nfraction successfully reproduce. On this last point, they state,\n\n\nThe group of organisms chosen by fate to become the parents of the\nnext generation is usually, but always occasionally, considerably\nsmaller than the number of individuals of their species. (1921:\n120)\n\n\nThus, the Hagedoorns endorse points 1\u20135 above, while describing\ntwo additional processes besides #4 (the founding of a new\npopulation), namely the splitting of a population and the random\nsampling of parents. They further explain the relevance of #3 (small\npopulations): \u201cthe smaller the group, the more limited its\npotential variability, the sooner it will be pure altogether\u201d\n(p. 123). And finally, they maintain that drift can produce fixation\n(\u201cpurity\u201d), or the complete loss of variation within a\npopulation, even in the absence of selection. Fisher (1922b) reads the\nHagedoorns as claiming that \u201crandom survival is a more important\nfactor in limiting the variability of species than preferential\nsurvival\u201d (p. 321), a claim that he challenged by attempting to\nshow that such a process would be too slow to overcome the rate of\nmutation (and thus the introduction of new variability\u2014but he\nseems to say otherwise in 1922a).\n\nAn essay published by Wright in 1931 provides what is perhaps one of\nthe earliest explicit characterizations of drift:\n\n\nIt has seemed to me that another factor should be much more important\nin keeping the system of gene frequencies from settling into\nequilibrium. This is the effect of random sampling in a\nbreeding population of limited size. The gene frequencies of one\ngeneration may be expected to differ a little from those of the\npreceding merely by chance. In the course of generations this\nmay bring about important changes, although the farther the\ndrift from the theoretical equilibrium, the greater will be\nthe pressure toward return. (Wright 1931b: 205; emphasis added)\n\n\nThe paper from which this quote is taken was meant to be a summary of\na longer paper, also published in 1931 (Wright 1986: 88). In the\nlonger paper (1931a), Wright specifies that the random sampling is of\ngametes. (Gametes are cells that fuse together during\nfertilization, such as an egg and a sperm). So, even though Wright\n(1931a) notes that the Hagedoorns had \u201curged the importance of\nsuch random fixation as a factor in evolution\u201d, and states that\nFisher (1922b) had analyzed the issue, has he changed the subject to\nbe random sampling of gametes rather than of\n\u201cparents\u201d (i.e., organisms)? In short, no: Wright (1932\nand elsewhere) makes it clear that he considers drift to encompass\nboth random sampling of gametes and random sampling of organisms. In\nother words, he has expanded the phenomena that the concept\nof drift is meant to cover from that discussed by Gulick, the\nHagedoorns, and Fisher. But Wright\u2019s 1932 paper also emphasized\nwhat would become a persistent confusion between drift and inbreeding;\nboth inbreeding and drift are more significant in small populations,\nso it can become easy to conflate them. But you can have random\nsampling of parents (say, through a population split) without\ninbreeding, and inbreeding without random sampling of parents. That\nalone shows that drift and inbreeding are not the same. So, not all of\nthe expansions of drift were productive ones.\n\nIt should be noted that while Wright and Fisher had numerous\nback-and-forth discussions and disagreements about each other\u2019s\nclaims concerning the role of drift in evolution (Provine 1986,\nSkipper 2002), they did not seem to disagree about what drift\nwas. Wright (1948) considered the following to be an\n\u201cacceptable statement\u201d of his view from Fisher and E.B.\nFord:\n\n\nGreat evolutionary importance has been attached by Sewall Wright\n(1931, 1932, 1935, 1940) to the fact that small shifts in the\ngene-ratios of all segregating factors will occur from generation to\ngeneration owing to the errors of random sampling in the process by\nwhich the gametes available in any one generation are chosen to\nconstitute the next. Such chance deviations will, of course, be\ngreater the smaller the isolated populations concerned. (Fisher and\nFord 1947)\n\n\nOn the other hand, Wright\u2019s later incorporation of fluctuations\nin mutation rate, fluctuations in migration, and fluctuations in\nselection (see, e.g., Wright 1949) as types of drift was challenged by\nCain and Currey, who asserted that \u201cthe worker on actual\nexamples must classify processes according to their biological\nsignificance\u201d and that such lumping together would produce\nconfusion and prevent proper analysis of actual situations (Cain &\nCurrey 1963: 59). They thus urged the use of the term \u201csampling\ndrift\u201d, which Wright adopted in the fourth volume of his 1978\nmagnum opus, Evolution and the Genetics of Populations.\n\nIn short, drift\u2019s founders exhibit a diversity of views about\ndrift, which John Beatty helpfully describes as follows:\n\n\ndrift is a heterogeneous category of evolutionary causes and effects,\nwhose overall significance relative to other modes of evolution\n(especially evolution by natural selection) has been greatly disputed.\n(Beatty 1992: 273)\n\n\nPotential causes invoked in the discussion above include sampling of\ngametes, sampling of parents, founding of new populations, splitting\nof populations, each of which is intensified when populations are\nsmall, while potential effects mentioned include fluctuations of gene\nfrequencies from one generation to the next, loss of variants from a\npopulation, and fixation of a (possibly non-adapted) type in a\npopulation. Are these causes and effects all drift? With that\nsort of confusing heterogeneity, there is little surprise that the\nconcept has drawn philosophical attention. But at least we have our\nstarting point for philosophical discussion (see Beatty 1992 and\nPlutynski 2007 for additional historical overview).\n",
