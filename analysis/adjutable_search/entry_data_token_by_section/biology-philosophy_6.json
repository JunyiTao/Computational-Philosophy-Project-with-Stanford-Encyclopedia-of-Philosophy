Philosophy of Ecology and Conservation Biology\n\nUntil recently this was an extremely underdeveloped field in the\nphilosophy of biology. This is surprising, because there is obvious\npotential for all three of the approaches to philosophy of biology\ndiscussed above. There is also a substantial body of philosophical\nwork in environmental ethics, and answering the questions that arise\nthere would require a critical examination of ecology and conservation\nbiology (Brennan 2014). Over the last twenty years, this field has\ndeveloped rapidly (Colyvan et. al. 2009).\n\nPhilosophers have started to remedy the neglect of ecology and a\nnumber of major books have appeared (Cooper 2003, Ginzburg and Colyvan\n2004, Sarkar 2005, MacLaurin and Sterelny 2008). The discussions have\nfocused on several topics including the complicated and sometimes\ntroubled relationship between mathematical models and empirical data\nin ecology (Shrader-Frechette & McCoy 1993; Ginzburg and Colyvan\n2004; Odenbaugh 2005; Weisberg 2012), whether there are distinctive\necological laws (Cooper 2003; Mikkelson 2003; Lange 2005; Eliot 2011b,\nLinquist et. al. 2016), the nature and reality of ecological\ncommunities and ecosystems (Sterelny 2006; Odenbaugh 2007; Eliot\n2011), the \u201crobustness\u201c of ecological principles\n(Odenbaugh 2003; Weisberg & Reisman 2008; Justus 2012), the idea\nof ecological stability and the \u201cbalance of nature\u201d\n(Odenbaugh 2001; Cooper 2003; Mikkelson 2001; Justus 2008), the\ndefinition of biodiversity (Sarkar 2005; MacLaurin and Sterelny 2008;\nSantana 2014), and the relationship between ecology and conservation\nbiology (Linquist 2008). Recently, there has been interesting work\ndone on functions in ecology as well (Jax, 2005; Odenbaugh 2010;\nNunes-Neto et. al. 2014; Dussault & Bouchard 2017). Most\necologists and evolutionary biologists do not think communities or\necosystems are units of selection, and thus the selected-effects\naccount of functions does not readily apply. So, philosophers of\necology have been exploring alternatives. \n",
