    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\nRichard Kilvington (we know almost seventy different spellings of his\nname) was born at the beginning of the fourteenth century in the\nvillage of Kilvington, Yorkshire. He was the son of a priest from the\ndiocese of York. He studied at Oxford, where he became Master of Arts\n(1324/25) then Doctor of Theology (ca. 1335) (for biographical\ndetails, see Kretzmann and Kretzmann 1990b, Jung-Palczewska 2000b).\nHis academic career was followed by a diplomatic and an ecclesiastical\none, working in the service of Edward III and taking part in\ndiplomatic missions. His career culminated in his appointment as Dean\nof St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral in London. Along with Richard Fitzralph,\nKilvington was involved in the battle against the mendicant friars, an\nargument that continued almost until his death in 1361.\n\nOther than a few sermons, all of Kilvington\u2019s known works stem\nfrom his lectures at Oxford. None is written in the usual commentary\nfashion, following the order of books in the respective works of\nAristotle. In accordance with the fourteenth-century Oxford practice,\nthe number of topics discussed was reduced to certain central issues,\nwhich were fully developed with no more than ten questions in each\nset. The reduction in the range of topics is counterbalanced by deeper\nanalysis in the questions chosen for treatment. Some of\nKilvington\u2019s questions cover fifteen folios, which in a modern\nedition yield about 120 pages. His philosophical works, the\nSophismata and Quaestiones super libros De generatione et\ncorruptione, composed before 1325, came from his lectures as a\nBachelor of Arts; the Quaestiones super libros Physicorum\n(1325/26) and Quaestiones super libros Ethicorum (1326/32)\ndate from his time as an Arts Master; after he advanced to the Faculty\nof Theology, he penned eight questions on Peter Lombard\u2019s\nSentences, composed before 1334.\n\nThe manuscript tradition of Kilvington\u2019s works is complex. The\nquestion on the Ethics and on the Sentences are\noften edited in different ways, with many omissions and corrections by\nscribes (Micha\u0142owska 2011b). The most complicated, however, is\nthe tradition of his questions on Aristotles\u2019 libri\nnaturales, that is, on the On generation and corruption\nand the Physics. It testifies perfectly well to the\ndispersion of these works, which probably occurred shortly after the\nquestions were written. The reconstruction of these commentaries was\npossible thanks to cross references to be found in the questions (Jung\n& Podko\u0144ski 2020: 16\u201317).\n",
