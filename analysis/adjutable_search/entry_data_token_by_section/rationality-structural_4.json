    "main_text": "What is Structural Rationality? || The Unity of Structural Rationality\n1.5 The Unity of Structural Rationality\n\nAs the above list makes clear, the instances of structural\nirrationality are a diverse bunch. One may reasonably wonder what, if\nanything, all these instances have in common. Some (e.g. Broome 2013)\nseem to think that it is enough simply to say that they are all\ncombinations of states that are jointly irrational, but others aspire\nto identify something deeper in virtue of which they share this\nproperty.\n\nOne way of trying to do this is to embrace the reductivist view\nmentioned in \u00a71.3 above. On this view, what structurally\nirrational states have in common is that they are all combinations of\nattitudes that cannot simultaneously be supported by one\u2019s\nreasons. However, as we saw, this view faces some important\nchallenges, such as accounting for the structural irrationality of\nsets of individually permissible attitudes. (It\u2019s worth noting\nthat there is another family of views that also, in a different way,\ntries to explain structural rationality in terms of reasons. On these\nviews, what unifies structurally irrational states is that they\ninvolve the agent\u2019s going against her beliefs about\nreasons (\u201ctransparency\u201d accounts), or her apparent reasons\n(\u201capparent reasons accounts\u201d). We discuss these views, and\nproblems with them, in \u00a73.3.)\n\nIn a similar but somewhat different vein, some explore the idea that\nattitudes are structurally irrational just in case they can\u2019t\nall \u201csucceed\u201d, or fulfil their \u201caim\u201d, where\nthis might be truth for beliefs and satisfaction or correctness for\nintentions or preferences (Fink forthcoming; Fullhart and Martinez\nforthcoming; see also Gibbard 2003; Brunero 2020: Ch. 7; Rosa 2022;\nSingh forthcoming). However, this proposal struggles to explain the\nincoherence of other mental states, such as credences. It is also far\nfrom obvious that akratic attitude combinations cannot be jointly\nsuccessful \u2013 after all, the beliefs involved in epistemic\nakrasia are logically consistent, and it is possible for a belief that\none ought to \\(\\Phi\\) to be true even if the corresponding intention\nis not satisfied. Proponents of this view are thus pressed to either\naccept certain revisionary implications, to introduce more substantive\nand hence more controversial success conditions for attitudes, or to\ngive up the ambition to provide a fully unifying account of structural\nirrationality.\n\nAnother at least partially unifying proposal is\n\u201ccognitivism\u201d, which aspires to reduce certain structural\nrequirements governing intention (such as that of means-end coherence)\nto certain structural requirements governing belief (such as that of\ndeductive closure) (Harman 1976; Velleman 1989; Wallace 2001; Setiya\n2007). This view is premised on a corresponding cognitivism about\nintention, on which, roughly, intending to \\(\\Phi\\) involves believing\none will \\(\\Phi\\). Given this, failures of means-end coherence (for\nexample) arguably result in one\u2019s violating closure \u2013\nspecifically, violating a modus ponens requirement by believing one\nwill \\(\\Phi\\), believing that one will \\(\\Phi\\) only if one\n\\(\\Psi\\)-s, but not believing that one will \\(\\Psi\\). As cognitivists\nrecognize (Setiya 2007), their account must be complicated or\nsupplemented to deliver this result. This is because even if intending\nto \\(\\Phi\\) involves believing that one will \\(\\Phi\\), it\ndoesn\u2019t follow that not intending to \\(\\Psi\\) involves\nnot believing that one will \\(\\Psi\\) (perhaps one believes\nthat one will unintentionally \\(\\Psi)\\). Moreover, the view that an\nintention to \\(\\Phi\\) involves believing one will \\(\\Phi\\) has been\ncriticized (e.g., Bratman 2009a). Further, even if cognitivists are\nright to think that means-end incoherence necessarily involves\ndoxastic incoherence, there are reasons to think that the former\ninvolves a distinctively practical mistake that cannot be reduced to a\nmistake in one\u2019s cognitive attitudes (e.g., Brunero 2020: Ch.\n6). And finally, in our context, it is an open question whether\ncognitivism can be a fully unifying theory of structural rationality,\nas it is unclear how, for example, practical akrasia can be understood\nas a violation of a purely doxastic structural requirements, or how\ncognitivism delivers unity within the class of doxastic\nstructural requirements.\n\nA proposal put forward by some formally-inclined philosophers is that\nstructurally irrational states are those that make one exploitable to\nloss through devices such as Dutch books or money\n pumps.[4]\n However, again, this proposal seems insufficiently general to capture\nall instances of structural irrationality: for example, there is no\nobvious way in which someone with (either epistemically or\npractically) akratic states is vulnerable to such loss. Moreover, even\nwhere structural irrationality and exploitability coincide, it is\ndubious whether it is the latter that explains the former, rather than\nvice versa. Numerous philosophers have argued that one\u2019s\nsusceptibility to Dutch books or money pumps merely reflects\nor brings out one\u2019s irrationality, rather than\ngrounding or explaining it, since it is unclear why vulnerability to\npurely hypothetical monetary loss (that can only be exacted by someone\nwith full knowledge of one\u2019s mental states, and is almost\ncertain not to actually occur) is the right sort of thing to\nmake one irrational (Lewis 1999: 404\u20135; Christensen\n2004: 109\u201324; Gaus 2008: 39; Levy 2014: 2).\n\nFinally, it has recently been proposed that structurally irrational\nstates are unified by the fact that it is in some way difficult to\nsustain them in full, reflective self-knowledge. On one version of\nthis proposal (Worsnip 2018b), this is because it is constitutive of\nthe mental states involved that to genuinely count as having these\nstates, one must have some disposition to revise them when these\nconditions of \u201cfull transparency\u201d are met. For example, if\none believes that to go shopping today one must get on one\u2019s\nbike now, and does not intend to get on one\u2019s bike now, and one\nis fully and consciously aware of both of these states and has no\ndisposition to revise them, then one arguably does not count as\nintending to go shopping today (cf. also Finlay 2009; Lee 2022).\nAgain, though, this proposal faces some challenges. In particular, it\nseems to force us to choose between denying that completely clear-eyed\npractical akrasia is possible and denying that practical akrasia is\nstructurally irrational. It may also struggle with examples of\nindividuals who hold logically inconsistent or even contradictory\nbeliefs but are not disposed to revise them because they subscribe to\nnon-classical logics.\n",
