    "main_text": "Theory and Theoretical Virtues || Theory Construction\n2.2 Theory Construction\n\nThere\u2019s been a long history of comparing moral theories to\nother sorts of theories, such as scientific ones. For example, in\nmeta-ethics one issue has to do with the nature of moral\n\u201cevidence\u201d on analogy with scientific evidence. \n On what Ronald Dworkin terms the \u201cnatural model\u201d the\ntruths of morality are discovered, just as the truths of science are\n(Dworkin 1977, 160). It is our considered intuitions that provide the\nclues to discover these moral truths, just as what is observable to us\nprovides the evidence to discover scientific truths. He compared\nthis model with the \u201cconstructive model\u201d in which the\nintuitions themselves are features of the theory being constructed and\nare not analogous to observations of the external world.\n\nYet, even if we decide that morality lacks the same type of\nphenomena to be accounted for as science, morality clearly figures into\nour normative judgments and reactions. One might view these\n\u2013 our intuitions about moral cases, for example \u2013 to\nprovide the basic data that needs to be accounted for by a theory on\neither model.\n\nOne way to \u201caccount for\u201d our considered intuitions would\nbe to debunk them. There is a long tradition of this in moral\nphilosophy as well. When scholars provided genealogies of\nmorality that explained our considered intuitions in terms of social\nor evolutionary forces that are not sensitive the truth, for example,\nthey were debunking morality by undercutting the authority of our\nintuitions to provide insight into it (Nietzsche 1887 [1998], Joyce\n2001, Street 2006). In this entry, however, we consider the ways in\nwhich moral theorists have constructed their accounts by taking the\nintuitions seriously as something to be systematized, explained, and\nas something that can be applied to generate the correct moral\ndecisions or outcomes.\n\nAlong these lines, one method used in theory construction would\ninvolve the use of reflective equilibrium and inference to the best\nexplanation. For example, one might notice an apparent inconsistency\nin moral judgements regarding two structurally similar cases and then\ntry to figure out what principle or set of principles would achieve\nconsistency between them. In this case, the theorist is trying to\nfigure out what best explains both of those intuitions. But one also\nmight, after thinking about principles one already accepts, or finds\nplausible, reject one of those intuitions on the basis of it not\ncohering with the rest of one\u2019s considered views. But full\ntheory construction will go beyond this because of the fully\ntheoretical virtues discussed earlier. We want a systematic account\nthat coheres well not only with itself, but with other things that we\nbelieve on the basis of good evidence.\n",
