    "main_text": "Negation and opposition in natural language || Negation in natural language: markedness and asymmetry\n1.2 Negation in natural language: markedness and asymmetry\n\nIt has often been observed that the logical symmetry of negative and\naffirmative propositions in logic belies a fundamental asymmetry in\nnatural language. It was Plato who first observed, in The\nSophist, that negative sentences are less valuable than\naffirmative ones, less specific and less informative. The ontological,\nepistemological, psychological, and grammatical priority of\naffirmatives over negatives is supported by Aristotle:\n\n\nThe affirmative proposition is prior to and better known than the\nnegative (since affirmation explains denial just as being is prior to\nnot-being) (Metaphysics 996b14\u201316)\n\n\nand St. Thomas Aquinas:\n\n\nThe affirmative enunciation is prior to the negative for three\nreasons\u2026 With respect to vocal sound, affirmative enunciation\nis prior to negative because it is simpler, for the negative\nenunciation adds a negative particle to the affirmative. With respect\nto thought, the affirmative enunciation, which signifies composition\nby the intellect, is prior to the negative, which signifies\ndivision\u2026 With respect to the thing, the affirmative\nenunciation, which signifies to be, is prior to the negative,\nwhich signifies not to be, as the having of something is\nnaturally prior to the privation of it. (St. Thomas, Book I, Lesson\nXIII, cited in Oesterle 1962, 64)\n\n\nNot only are negative statements (e.g., \u201cParis isn\u2019t the\ncapital of Spain\u201d) generally less informative than affirmatives\n(\u201cParis is the capital of France\u201d), they are\nmorphosyntactically more marked (all languages have negative markers\nwhile few have affirmative\n markers)[3]\n and psychologically more complex and harder to process (see Just and\nCarpenter 1971, 248\u20139; and other work reviewed in Horn 1989,\nChapter 3). Many philosophers, linguists, and psychologists have\nsituated this asymmetry in logic or semantics, as in the claim that\nevery negation presupposes a corresponding affirmative but not vice\nversa.\n\nThe strong asymmetricalist position leads to the \u201cparadox of\nnegative judgment\u201d: if a positive statement refers or\ncorresponds to a positive fact, to what state of affairs does a\nnegative statement refer or correspond? What in fact is a negative\nfact? For Bergson (1911, 289), negation is necessarily \u201cof a\npedagogical and social nature\u201d; for Wood (1933, 421) it is\n\u201cinfected with error and ignorance\u201d. According to\nWittgenstein (1953, \u00a7447), \u201cthe feeling is as if the\nnegation of a proposition had to make it true in a certain sense in\norder to negate it\u201d. Giv\u00f3n (1978, 70) points to the\ndiscourse presuppositionality of utterances like \u201cMy wife is not\npregnant\u201d. Psycholinguistic studies have shown that negation is\neasier to process when the denied proposition, if not already in the\ndiscourse model, is at least a plausible addition to it (e.g.,\n\u201cThe whale is not a fish/?bird\u201d; cf. Wason 1965; Horn\n1989, Chapter 3).\n\nBeyond its marked status, negation has also been analyzed variously as\na modality, a propositional attitude, and a speech act. The danger\nhere is putting the pragmatic cart before the semantic horse. For\nexample, not every negation is a speaker denial (in making this point,\nFrege points to the non-denial nature of embedded negation as in\n\u201cIf not-\\(p\\) then \\(q\\)\u201d), nor is every speaker denial a\nlinguistic negation. Given the repeated attempts over the centuries to\nliquidate or tame it\u2014negation as positive difference, as\ndissimilarity or incompatibility, as falsity, as an admission of\nepistemic impoverishment, as the speech act of denial\u2014and its\nresilience in surviving these attacks, negation qualifies as the\nRasputin of the propositional calculus.\n\nBut the prototypical use of negation is indeed as a denial of a\nproposition attributable to, or at least considered by, someone\nrelevant to the discourse context. While affirmation standardly\nintroduces a proposition into the discourse model, negation\u2014in\nits \u201cchief use\u201d (Jespersen 1917, 4), its \u201cmost\ncommon use\u201d (Ayer 1952, 39), its \u201cstandard and primary\nuse\u201d (Strawson 1952, 7)\u2014is directed at a proposition that\nis already in or that can be accommodated by the discourse model.\n",
