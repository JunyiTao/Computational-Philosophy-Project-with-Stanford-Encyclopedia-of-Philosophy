    "main_text": "What is a gene? || A proposal for a new concept, the process molecular gene concept\n4.4  A proposal for a new concept, the process molecular gene concept\n\n\nNeumann-Held (2001) proposes a new way to think about genes in the\ncontext of developmental genetics. She says that in this context,\ninterest in genes is largely focused on the regulated expression of\npolypeptides. She notes that textbook definitions of gene often\nacknowledge this interest and quotes the following definition from a\nscientific textbook:\n\n\n A combination of DNA segments that together constitute an expressible\nunit, expression leading the formation of one or more specific\nfunctional gene products that may lead to either RNA molecules or\npolypeptides. The segments of a gene include (1) the transcribed unit\n\u2026 and any regulatory segments included in the transcription\nunit, and (2) the regulatory sequences that flank the trancription\nunit and are required for specific expression. (Singer and Berg 1991,\np. 41). \n\n\nThis definition emphasizes that regulatory sequences as well as\ncoding regions are required for \u201cspecific\nexpression.\u201d Only a small proportion of coding sequences\nare transcribed in a given cell at a particular time, and whether a\nparticular sequence is transcribed depends in part on regulatory\nregions external to the coding region.\n\n\nNeumann-Held points out that if the aim is to specify what is\nnecessary for regulated synthesis of polypeptides, then one must\ninclude even more than what is located in the DNA. This follows from\nthe fact that processes such as differential splicing (and RNA editing\nprocesses such as methylation that I have not discussed in this\narticle) involve entities outside of DNA such as splicing agents.  She\nsuggests that it is appropriate, at least in the context of\ndevelopmental genetics, to reconceive genes as processes. She proposes\nthe following process molecular gene concept.\n\n\n\u201cGene\u201d is the process (i.e., the course of events) that\nbinds together DNA and all other relevant non-DNA entities in the\nproduction of a particular polypeptide. The term gene in this\nsense stands for processes which are specified by (1) the specific\ninteractions between specific DNA segments and specific non-DNA\nlocated entities, (2) specific processing mechanisms of resulting\nmRNA's in interactions with additional non-DNA located entities.\n(Neumann-Held 2001, p. 74).\n\n\n\n\nNeumann-Held argues that this conception provides the clearest basis\nfor understanding how DNA sequences are \u201cused in the processes\nof polypeptide production.\u201d She points out that the\nprocess molecular gene concept allows for the inclusion of coding\nsequences in DNA, regulatory sequences in DNA and also entities not\nlocated in DNA, all of which are causally involved in the production\nof polypeptides. Neumann-Held's concept excludes transcription\nprocesses and coding regions of DNA that lead to functional RNA\nmolecules that are not translated into polypeptides. Hence, according\nto her account, there are not process molecular genes for tRNA\n(transfer RNA), rRNA (ribosomal RNA) or snRNA (small nuclear\nRNA). This feature of Neumann-Held's definition does not match the\ntextbook definition that she quotes to motivate her account (presented\nabove). Furthermore, the exclusion of these coding regions does not\ntrack with recent discoveries about the important functions played by\nnon-coding RNA molecules such as snRNAs. Her definition could easily\nbe revised to accommodate these regions and processes. In any case,\nNeumann-Held believes using this concept in developmental genetics,\nrather than DNA-centered gene concepts, will help avoid the view that\n\u201cgenes are the most important explanatory factors in biology\nbecause of their unique causal powers\u201d (Neumann-Held 2001,\np. 80).\n",
