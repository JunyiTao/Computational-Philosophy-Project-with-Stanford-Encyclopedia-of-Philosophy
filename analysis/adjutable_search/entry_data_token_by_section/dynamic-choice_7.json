    "main_text": "Solving Dynamic Choice Problems || Rational Irrationality\n2.1 Rational Irrationality\n\nTwo strategies that we can sometimes use to solve (in the sense of\npractically deal with) dynamic choice problems are suggested in\nKavka\u2019s description of the toxin puzzle. One strategy is to use\ngimmicks that cause one to reason or choose in a way that does not\naccord with one\u2019s preferences. The other strategy involves the\narrangement of external incentives. Although such maneuvers are ruled\nout in Kavka\u2019s case, they can prove useful in less restrictive\ncases. This subsection considers the former strategy and the next\nsubsection considers the latter strategy.\n\nIf one accepts the common assumption that causing oneself to reason or\nchoose in a way that does not accord with one\u2019s preferences\ninvolves rendering oneself irrational, the former strategy can be\nthought of as aiming at rationally-induced irrationality. A fanciful\nbut clear illustration of this strategy is presented in Derek\nParfit\u2019s work (1984). In Parfit\u2019s example (which is\nlabeled Schelling\u2019s Answer to Armed Robbery because it\ndraws on Thomas Schelling\u2019s view that \u201cit is not a\nuniversal advantage in situations of conflict to be inalienably and\nmanifestly rational in decision and motivation\u201d (Schelling 1960,\n18)), a robber breaks into someone\u2019s house and orders the owner,\ncall him Moe, to open the safe in which he hoards his gold. The robber\nthreatens to shoot Moe\u2019s children unless Moe complies. But Moe\nrealizes that both he and his children will probably be shot even if\nhe complies, since the robber will want to get rid of them so that\nthey cannot record his getaway car information and get it to the\npolice (who will be arriving from the nearest town in about 15 minutes\nin response to Moe\u2019s call, which was prompted by the first signs\nof the break-in). Fortunately, Moe has a special drug at hand that, if\nconsumed, causes one to be irrational for a brief period. Recognizing\nthat this drug is his only real hope, Moe consumes the drug and\nimmediately loses his wits. He begins \u201creeling about the\nroom\u201d saying things like \u201cGo ahead. I love my children. So\nplease kill them\u201d (Parfit 1984, 13). Given Moe\u2019s current\nstate, the robber cannot do anything that will induce Moe to open the\nsafe. There is no point in killing Moe or his children. The only\nsensible thing to do now is to hurry off before the police arrive.\n\nGiven that consuming irrationality drugs and even hiring hypnotists\nare normally not feasible solutions to our dynamic choice problems,\nthe possibility of rationally inducing irrationality may seem\npractically irrelevant. But it may be that we often benefit from the\nnon-conscious employment of what is more or less a version of this\nstrategy. We sometimes, for example, engage in self-deception or\nindulge irrational fears or superstitions when it is convenient to do\nso. Many of us might, in toxin-type cases, be naturally prone to dwell\non and indulge superstitious fears, like the fear that one will\nsomehow be jinxed if one manages to get the million dollars but then\ndoes not drink the toxin. Given this fear, one might be quite\nconfident that one will drink the toxin if one gets the million; and\nso it might be quite easy for one to form the intention to drink the\ntoxin. Although this is not a solution to the toxin puzzle that one\ncan consciously plan on using (nor is it one that resolves the\ntheoretical issues raised by the case), it may nonetheless often help\nus effectively cope with toxin-type cases. (For a clear and compact\ndiscussion concerning self-deception, \u201cmotivationally biased\nbelief,\u201d and \u201cmotivated irrationality\u201d more\ngenerally, see, for example, Mele 2004.)\n",
