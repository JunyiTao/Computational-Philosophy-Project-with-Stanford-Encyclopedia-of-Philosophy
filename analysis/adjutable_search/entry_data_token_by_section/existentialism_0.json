    "main_text": "Nihilism and the Crisis of Modernity\n1. Nihilism and the Crisis of Modernity\nWe can find early glimpses of what might be called the\n\u201cexistential attitude\u201d (Solomon 2005) in the Stoic and\nEpicurean philosophies of antiquity, in the struggle with sin and\ndesire in St. Augustine\u2019s Confessions, in the intimate\nreflections on death and the meaning of life in Michel de\nMontaigne\u2019s Essays, and in the confrontation with the\n\u201cdreadful silence\u201d of the cosmos in Blaise Pascal\u2019s\nPens\u00e9es. But it was not until the nineteenth century that\nthe ideas began to coalesce into a bona fide intellectual movement. By\nthis time, an increasingly secular and scientific worldview was\nemerging and the traditional religious framework that gave pre-modern\nlife a sense of moral orientation and cohesion was beginning to\ncollapse. Without a north star of moral absolutes to guide us, the\nmodern subject was left abandoned and lost, \u201cwandering,\u201d as\nNietzsche writes, \u201cas if through an endless nothing\u201d (1887\n[1974], \u00a7125). But it wasn\u2019t just the rise of modern science\nand its cold mechanistic view of the world as a value-less aggregate of\nobjects in causal interaction that contributed to the anxiety and\nforlornness of the modern age. The rise of Protestantism also played a\nrole. With its rejection of hierarchical Church authority, this new\nform of Christianity emphasized subjective inwardness and created a\nunique social configuration grounded in principles of individualism,\nfreedom, and self-reliance. The result was the loss of a sense of\ncommunity and belongingness rooted in the close-knit social bonds of\ntraditional society. And the Protestant shift intensified the Christian\nattitude of contemptus mundi (\u201ccontempt for the\nworld\u201d), contributing to feelings of loneliness and creating a\nperception of public life as a domain that was fundamentally\ninauthentic and corrupt (Aho 2020; Guignon 2004; Taylor 1989).\nAlong with these historical developments, social transformations\nassociated with the Industrial Revolution and the formation of the\nmodern state were emerging. With newly mechanized working conditions\nand bureaucratic forms of administration, an increasingly impersonal\nand alienating social order was established. When Ortega y Gasset\nintroduces his notion of \u201cthe mass man,\u201d he captures the\nautomation and lifeless conformism of the machine age, where everybody\n\u201cfeels just like everybody else and is nevertheless not concerned\nabout it\u201d (1930 [1993, 15]). In their conceptions of \u201cthe\npublic\u201d (Kierkegaard), \u201cthe herd\u201d (Nietzsche), and\n\u201cthe They\u201d (Heidegger), existentialists offer powerful\ncritiques of the leveled down and routinized ways of being that\ncharacterize mass society. And the novels and short stories of\nDostoevsky, Camus, and Kafka capture the bourgeois emptiness and\nboredom of the managerial class and the paranoia and distrust that\nemerges when life is regulated and controlled by faceless\nbureaucrats.\nThese social transformations created the conditions for nihilism,\nwhere modern humanity suddenly found itself adrift and confused, unsure\nof which path to take or where to look for a stable and enduring sense\nof truth and meaning. The condition of nihilism involves the shocking\nrecognition that there is no overarching reason, order, or purpose to\nour existence, that it is all fundamentally meaningless and absurd. Of\nall the existentialists, Nietzsche was the most influential and\nprophetic in diagnosing and conceptualizing the crisis. With the death\nof God and the loss of moral absolutes, we are exposed to existence\n\u201cin its most terrible form \u2026 without meaning or\naim\u201d (Nietzsche 1887 [1974], \u00a755). And it is against this\nanomic background that the question of existence, of what it means to\nbe, becomes so urgent. But it is a question that requires taking a\nradically different standpoint than the one privileged by the\nphilosophical tradition. \n",
