The Weaknesses of Deontological Theories\n\nOn the other hand, deontological theories have their own weak spots.\nThe most glaring one is the seeming irrationality of our having duties\nor permissions to make the world morally worse. Deontologists need\ntheir own, non-consequentialist model of rationality, one that is a\nviable alternative to the intuitively plausible,\n\u201cact-to-produce-the-best-consequences\u201d model of\nrationality that motivates consequentialist theories. Until this is\ndone, deontology will always be paradoxical. There are several\ndistinct hurdles that the deontologist must overcome.\n\nOne hurdle is to confront the apparent fact that careful reflection\nabout the degrees of wrongdoing that are possible under any single\nmoral norm does not make it easy to see deontological morality as\nconsisting of general, canonically-formulated texts (conformity to\nwhich could then be said to constitute the distrinct form of practical\nrationality unique to deontological ethics); rather, such apparently\nsimple texts as, \u201cthou shalt not murder,\u201d look more like\nmere epistemic aids summarizing a much more nuanced and detailed (and\nthus less text-like) moral reality (Hurd and Moore\nforthcoming).\n\nA second hurdle is to find an answer to the inevitable question of\nauthority, assuming that there are such general texts. If it is\nrational to conform one\u2019s behavior and one\u2019s choices to certain\ngeneral texts, as deontology claims, it is always in point to demand\nthe reasons making such texts authoritative for one\u2019s\ndecisions. Deferring one\u2019s own best judgment to the judgment enshrined\nin some text is always prima facie paradoxical (see the entry on\n authority)\n and deontologists like everybody else need to justify such deference.\nHopefully they can do so other than by reference to some person-like\nbut omniscient Deity as the supposed source of such texts, because\nmany deontologists cannot accept such theism (Moore 1995). Moreover,\neven for those with theistic commitments, they may prefer to join\nKant\u2019s insistence that ethics proceed from reason alone, even in a\ntheistic world.\n\nThe third hurdle exists even if the first two are crossed\nadequately. This hurdle is to deal with the seeming demand of\ndeontological ethics that on occasion one\u2019s categorical obligations\nrequire one to preserve the purity of one\u2019s own moral agency at the\ncost of having one\u2019s actions make the world be in a morally worse\nstate of affairs\u2014at least, \u201cworse\u201d in the agent-neutral sense of\nthe word used by consequentialists. Patient-centered versions of\ndeontology cannot easily escape this problem, as we have shown. It is\nnot even clear that they have the conceptual resources to make agency\nimportant enough to escape this moral paradox. Yet even agent-centered\nversions face this paradox; having the conceptual resources (of agency\nand agent-relative reasons) is not the same as making it plausible\njust how a secular, objective morality can allow each person\u2019s agency\nto be so uniquely crucial to that person.\n\nMoreover, it is crucial for deontologists to deal with the conflicts\nthat seem to exist between certain duties, and between certain rights.\nFor more information, please see the entry on\n moral dilemmas.\n Kant\u2019s bold proclamation that \u201ca conflict of duties is\ninconceivable\u201d (Kant 1780, p.\u200925) is the conclusion\nwanted, but reasons for believing it are difficult to produce. The\nintending/foreseeing, doing/allowing, causing/aiding, and related\ndistinctions certainly reduce potential conflicts for the\nagent-centered versions of deontology; whether they can totally\neliminate such conflicts is a yet unresolved question.\n\nOne well known approach to deal with the possibility of conflict\nbetween deontological duties is to reduce the categorical force of\nsuch duties to that of only \u201cprima facie\u201d duties\n(Ross 1930, 1939). This idea is that conflict between merely prima\nfacie duties is unproblematic so long as it does not infect what\none is categorically obligated to do, which is what overall, concrete\nduties mandate. Like other softenings of the categorical force of\ndeontological obligation we mention briefly below (threshold\ndeontology, mixed views), the prima facie duty view is in\nsome danger of collapsing into a kind of consequentialism. This\ndepends on whether \u201cprima facie\u201d is read\nepistemically or not, and on (1) whether any good consequences are\neligible to justify breach of prima facie duties; (2) whether\nonly such consequences over some threshold can do so; or (3) whether\nonly threatened breach of other deontological duties can do so.\n\nThirdly, there is the manipulability worry mentioned before with\nrespect to agent-centered versions of deontology. To the extent\npotential conflict is eliminated by resort to the Doctrine of Double\nEffect, the Doctrine of Doing and Allowing, and so forth (and it is\nnot clear to what extent patient-centered versions rely on these\ndoctrines and distinctions to mitigate potential conflict), then a\npotential for \u201cavoision\u201d is opened up. Such avoision is\nthe manipulation of means (using omissions, foresight, risk,\nallowings, aidings, acceleratings, redirectings, etc.) to achieve\npermissibly what otherwise deontological morality would forbid (see\nKatz 1996). Avoision is an undesirable feature of any ethical system\nthat allows such strategic manipulation of its doctrines.\n\nFourth, there is what might be called the paradox of relative\nstringency. There is an aura of paradox in asserting that all\ndeontological duties are categorical\u2014to be done no matter the\nconsequences\u2014and yet asserting that some of such duties are more\nstringent than others. A common thought is that \u201cthere cannot be\ndegrees of wrongness with intrinsically wrong acts\u2026\u201d\n(Frey 1995, p. 78, n.3; also Hurka 2019). Yet relative\nstringency\u2014\u201cdegrees of wrongness\u201d\u2014seems forced\nupon the deontologist by one if not two considerations. First, duties\nof differential stringency can be weighed against one another if there\nis conflict between them, so that a conflict-resolving, overall duty\nbecomes possible if duties can be more or less stringent. Second, when\nwe punish for the wrongs consisting in our violation of deontological\nduties, we (rightly) do not punish all violations equally. The greater\nthe wrong, the greater the punishment deserved; and relative\nstringency of duty violated (or importance of rights) seems the best\nway of making sense of greater versus lesser wrongs (Hurd and Moore\nforthcoming).\n\nFifth, there are situations\u2014unfortunately not all of them\nthought experiments\u2014where compliance with deontological norms\nwill bring about disastrous consequences. To take a stock example of\nmuch current discussion, suppose that unless A violates the\ndeontological duty not to torture an innocent person (B),\nten, or a thousand, or a million other innocent people will die\nbecause of a hidden nuclear device. If A is forbidden by\ndeontological morality from torturing B, many would regard\nthat as a reductio ad absurdum of deontology.\n\nDeontologists have six possible ways of dealing with such \u201cmoral\ncatastrophes\u201d (although only two of these are very plausible).\nFirst, they can just bite the bullet and declare that sometimes doing\nwhat is morally right will have tragic results but that allowing such\ntragic results to occur is still the right thing to do. Complying with\nmoral norms will surely be difficult on those occasions, but the moral\nnorms apply nonetheless with full force, overriding all other\nconsiderations. We might call this the Kantian response, after Kant\u2019s\nfamous hyperbole: \u201cBetter the whole people should perish,\u201d\nthan that injustice be done (Kant 1780, p.\u2009100). One might also\ncall this the absolutist conception of deontology, because such a view\nmaintains that conformity to norms has absolute force and not merely\ngreat weight.\n\nThis first response to \u201cmoral catastrophes,\u201d which is to\nignore them, might be further justified by denying that moral\ncatastrophes, such as a million deaths, are really a million times\nmore catastrophic than one death. This is the so-called\n\u201caggregation\u201d problem, which we alluded to in\n section 2.2\n in discussing the paradox of deontological constraints. John Taurek\nfamously argued that it is a mistake to assume harms to two persons\nare twice as bad as a comparable harm to one person. For each of the\ntwo suffers only his own harm and not the harm of the other (Taurek\n1977). Taurek\u2019s argument can be employed to deny the existence of\nmoral catastrophes and thus the worry about them that deontologists\nwould otherwise have. Robert Nozick also stresses the separateness of\npersons and therefore urges that there is no entity that suffers\ndouble the harm when each of two persons is harmed (Nozick 1974). (Of\ncourse, Nozick, perhaps inconsistently, also acknowledges the\nexistence of moral catastrophes.) Most deontologists reject Taurek\u2019s\nradical conclusion that we need not be morally more obligated to avert\nharm to the many than to avert harm to the few; but they do accept the\nnotion that harms should not be aggregated. Deontologists\u2019 approaches\nto the nonaggregation problem when the choice is between saving the\nmany and saving the few are: (1) save the many so as to acknowledge\nthe importance of each of the extra persons; (2) conduct a weighted\ncoin flip; (3) flip a coin; or (4) save anyone you want (a denial of\nmoral catastrophes) (Broome 1998; Doggett 2013; Doucet 2013; Dougherty\n2013; Halstead 2016: Henning 2015; Hirose 2007, 2015; Hsieh et al.\n2006; Huseby 2011; Kamm 1993; Rasmussen 2012; Saunders 2009; Scanlon\n2003; Suikkanen 2004; Timmerman 2004; Wasserman and Strudler\n2003).\n\nThe second plausible response is for the deontologist to abandon\nKantian absolutism for what is usually called \u201cthreshold\ndeontology.\u201d A threshold deontologist holds that deontological\nnorms govern up to a point despite adverse consequences; but when the\nconsequences become so dire that they cross the stipulated threshold,\nconsequentialism takes over (Moore 1997, ch.\u200917). A\nmay not torture B to save the lives of two others, but he may\ndo so to save a thousand lives if the \u201cthreshold\u201d is\nhigher than two lives but lower than a thousand.\n\nThere are two varieties of threshold deontology that are worth\ndistinguishing. On the simple version, there is some fixed threshold\nof awfulness beyond which morality\u2019s categorical norms no longer have\ntheir overriding force. Such a threshold is fixed in the sense that it\ndoes not vary with the stringency of the categorical duty being\nviolated. The alternative is what might be called \u201csliding scale\nthreshold deontology.\u201d On this version, the threshold varies in\nproportion to the degree of wrong being done\u2014the wrongness of\nstepping on a snail has a lower threshold (over which the wrong can be\njustified) than does the wrong of stepping on a baby.\n\nThreshold deontology (of either stripe) is an attempt to save\ndeontological morality from the charge of fanaticism. It is similar to\nthe \u201cprima facie duty\u201d version of deontology\ndeveloped to deal with the problem of conflicting duties, yet\nthreshold deontology is usually interpreted with such a high threshold\nthat it more closely mimics the outcomes reached by a\n\u201cpure,\u201d absolutist kind of deontology. Threshold\ndeontology faces several theoretical difficulties. Foremost among them\nis giving a theoretically tenable account of the location of such a\nthreshold, either absolutely or on a sliding scale (Alexander 2000;\nEllis 1992; Moore 2019; Arneson 2019; Cole 2019; Alexander 2019). Why\nis the threshold for torture of the innocent at one thousand lives,\nsay, as opposed to nine hundred or two thousand? Another problem is\nthat whatever the threshold, as the dire consequences approach it,\ncounter-intuitive results appear to follow. For example, it may be\npermissible, if we are one-life-at-risk short of the threshold, to\npull one more person into danger who will then be saved, along with\nthe others at risk, by killing an innocent person (Alexander 2000).\nThirdly, there is some uncertainty about how one is to reason after\nthe threshold has been reached: are we to calculate at the margin on\nstraight consequentialist grounds, use an agent-weighted mode of\nsumming, or do something else? A fourth problem is that threshold\ndeontology threatens to collapse into a kind of consequentialism.\nIndeed, it can be perhaps shown that the sliding scale version of\nthreshold deontology is extensionally equivalent to an agency-weighted\nform of consequentialism (Sen 1982).\n\nThe remaining four strategies for dealing with the problem of dire\nconsequence cases all have the flavor of evasion by the deontologist.\nConsider first the famous view of Elizabeth Anscombe: such cases (real\nor imagined) can never present themselves to the consciousness of a\ntruly moral agent because such agent will realize it is immoral to\neven think about violating moral norms in order to avert disaster\n(Anscombe 1958; Geach 1969; Nagel 1979). Such rhetorical excesses\nshould be seen for what they are, a peculiar way of stating Kantian\nabsolutism motivated by an impatience with the question.\n\nAnother response by deontologists, this one most famously associated\nwith Bernard Williams, shares some of the \u201cdon\u2019t think about\nit\u201d features of the Anscombean response. According to Williams\n(1973), situations of moral horror are simply \u201cbeyond\nmorality,\u201d and even beyond reason. (This view is reminiscent of\nthe ancient view of natural necessity, revived by Sir Francis Bacon,\nthat such cases are beyond human law and can only be judged by the\nnatural law of instinct.) Williams tells us that in such cases we just\nact. Interestingly, Williams contemplates that such\n\u201cexistentialist\u201d decision-making will result in our doing\nwhat we have to do in such cases\u2014for example, we torture the\ninnocent to prevent nuclear holocaust.\n\nSurely this is an unhappy view of the power and reach of human law,\nmorality, or reason. Indeed, Williams (like Bacon and Cicero before\nhim) thinks there is an answer to what should be done, albeit an\nanswer very different than Anscombe\u2019s. But both views share the\nweakness of thinking that morality and even reason runs out on us when\nthe going gets tough.\n\nYet another strategy is to divorce completely the moral appraisals of\nacts from the blameworthiness or praiseworthiness of the agents who\nundertake them, even when those agents are fully cognizant of the\nmoral appraisals. So, for example, if A tortures innocent\nB to save a thousand others, one can hold that A\u2019s\nact is morally wrong but also that A is morally praiseworthy\nfor having done it.\n\nDeontology does have to grapple with how to mesh deontic judgments of\nwrongness with \u201chypological\u201d (Zimmerman 2002) judgments of\nblameworthiness (Alexander 2004). Yet it would be an oddly cohering\nmorality that condemned an act as wrong yet praised the doer of it.\nDeontic and hypological judgments ought to have more to do with each\nother than that. Moreover, it is unclear what action-guiding potential\nsuch an oddly cohered morality would have: should an agent facing such\na choice avoid doing wrong, or should he go for the praise?\n\nThe last possible strategy for the deontologist in order to deal with\ndire consequences, other than by denying their existence, as per\nTaurek, is to distinguish moral reasons from all-things-considered\nreasons and to argue that whereas moral reasons dictate obedience to\ndeontological norms even at the cost of catastrophic consequences,\nall-things-considered reasons dictate otherwise. (This is one reading\nof Bernard William\u2019s famous discussion of moral luck, where non-moral\nreasons seemingly can trump moral reasons (Williams 1975, 1981); this\nis also a strategy some consequentialists (e.g., Portmore 2003) seize\nas well in order to handle the demandingness and alienation problems\nendemic to consequentialism.) But like the preceding strategy, this\none seems desperate. Why should one even care that moral reasons align\nwith deontology if the important reasons, the all-things-considered\nreasons that actually govern decisions, align with\nconsequentialism?\n",
