Taking this thought to heart, one might hold that if\nJanet tries to get a yellow mango, then a yellow mango is what Janet\ndesires. But Janet can desire a yellow mango even when she is not\ntrying to get one (she might be struck by a craving while all out of\nmangoes, and not be willing to go shopping at that moment). So there is\nreason to want something more elaborate as a theory of desire. To deal\nwith Janet, it might seem simplest to hold that desires\ndispose us to action, without always bringing it about that we\nact. Although Janet is not trying to get a mango, she is disposed to\nget one\u2014and would, were it only more convenient to do so. This\nleads to a simple, action-based theory of desire.\n\n  For an organism to desire p is for the organism to be\n  disposed to act so as to bring about p.\n\n  \n\n\nThis sort of theory has been criticized for being insufficiently\nrestrictive, because it appears to attribute desires to organisms on\nthe basis of mere behavioral tics. For instance, if a woman has a\ntendency to stutter, then it follows from the theory above that she has\na desire to stutter\u2014simply because she is disposed to act so as\nto stutter. For such reasons, it is common to prefer a more\nsophisticated version of an action-based theory of desire.\n\n  For an organism to desire p is for the organism to be\n  disposed to take whatever actions it believes are likely to bring about\n  p.\n\n  \n\n\nAccording to this theory, for Janet to desire to have a yellow mango\nis just for her to be disposed to go to the fridge, or the store, or to\nask her friend, or to do whatever else she believes likely to get her a\nyellow mango. She need not actually do any of these things, for she\nmight desire to do something else even more, or might be asleep, or\ndrugged, or otherwise prevented from doing the things she is disposed\nto do, but she must be (at least to some extent) disposed to do them\nall else being equal. Likewise, for John to desire that Janet love him\nis for John to be disposed to take whatever actions he believes are\nlikely to make it the case that Janet loves him. And so on, for the\nvarious desires that people and other organisms are capable of having.\nMichael Smith has very clearly articulated this sort of theory of\ndesire in a number of works (Smith 1987; 1994).\n\n\nLike their less sophisticated counterparts, more sophisticated\naction-based theories of desire have been criticized for being\ninsufficiently restrictive. Dennis Stampe points out that a person who\nbelieves that serving just so will cause him to double fault in tennis\nmight thereby become disposed to serve just so and double fault (being\nnervous seems to have this effect quite often), but this would not show\nthat such a person desires to double fault (Stampe 1986). And a number\nof philosophers have suggested that desires are only one psychological\nstate able to initiate action, so that it is a mistake to identify\ndesires with psychological states disposing us to actions. Some of\nthese philosophers have focused on the negative point, that what might\nbe called \u2018true desires\u2019 do not exhaust the possible\nmotivational states (Davis 1986; Marks 1986). Others have focused on a\npositive alternative to desire as a motivating state, and these latter\nhave tended to focus on the idea that a judgment of what is good (or\nobligatory) is at least one further psychological state that can lead\nto action, independently of antecedent desire. In both the case of\ndesire and of belief in the good, being in such a state is being\ndisposed to take whatever actions are believed likely to bring about\nwhat is desired or what is judged good. But according to these\nphilosophers, desires and judgments of goodness are very different\nthings. Hence action-based theories of desire fail to make an important\ndistinction (e.g., McDowell 1978; Scanlon 1998).\n\n\nAn important variant of action-based theories of desire holds that\ndesires are mental states that have the function of producing actions,\nrather than mental states that merely dispose agents to act. On these\ntheories, a desire might or might not dispose an actor to satisfy the\ndesire, but causing that result is the job or purpose of the desire\n(the biological function of the desire), or bringing about the\nsatisfaction of the desire is how the action-production systems do\ntheir jobs or fulfill their purposes (Millikan 1984; Papineau 1987).\nWhile these variations do well with Stampe-type objections (because it\nis not the purpose of a belief that one is going to double fault to\ncause a double fault), they nonetheless would seem to be subject to\nobjections by those who think that beliefs in the good can also perform\ntheir functions by moving one to act.\n\n\nTo overcome these latter objections, the action-based theorist may\nfollow any of a number of lines of argument. The action-based theorist\nmay argue that mere beliefs in goodness cannot move agents to act,\ngiven an independently motivated theory of belief in general (a\nposition open to many philosophers of mind with complementary theories\nof belief and desire). Or he may argue that there is an incoherence in\nthe principles by which one should revise a belief in goodness and by\nwhich one should revise one's dispositions to act (see the\ndiscussion of Lewis below in section 1.3), so that there is something\nincoherent in the idea of a belief in goodness that also moves one to\nact. Or, in a more concessive spirit, he may allow that the\naction-based theory of desire should be supplemented with other\nelements (dispositions to pleasure, for instance) not characteristic of\nbeliefs in goodness.\n\n\nOne further difficulty for action-based theories of desire comes from\napparent desires for things that action is ill-suited to bring about\n(evidence, that is, that the action-based theory of desire is\nexcessively restrictive). For example, suppose it is possible for me\nto desire that pi be a rational number, or to desire that I had never\nbeen born, or to desire that a committee decide in my favor regardless\nof what I do (Schroeder 2004). These are desires that do not seem to\nexist in virtue of facts about dispositions to action, even facts\nabout what actions I would perform if I were so foolish as to believe\nthat I could fulfill my desires by actions. In response, the\naction-based theorist may hold that these attitudes are not true\ndesires at all but only related conative attitudes: wishes, perhaps. A\ndifferent line of response might be to hold that, even for such\ndesires, dispositions to act still exist, even if they are unlikely to\nbe acted upon in moderately reasonable people (Wall 2009).\n",
