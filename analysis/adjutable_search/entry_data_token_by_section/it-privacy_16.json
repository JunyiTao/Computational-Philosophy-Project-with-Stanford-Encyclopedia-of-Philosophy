    "main_text": "How can information technology itself solve privacy concerns? || Identity management\n4. Emerging technologies and our understanding of privacy\n\nIn the previous sections, we have outlined how current technologies\nmay impact privacy, as well as how they may contribute to mitigating\nundesirable effects. However, there are future and emerging\ntechnologies that may have an even more profound impact. Consider for\nexample brain-computer interfaces. In case computers are connected\ndirectly to the brain, not only behavioral characteristics are subject\nto privacy considerations, but even one\u2019s thoughts run the risk of\nbecoming public, with decisions of others being based upon them. In\naddition, it could become possible to change one\u2019s behavior by means\nof such technology. Such developments therefore require further\nconsideration of the reasons for protecting privacy. In particular,\nwhen brain processes could be influenced from the outside, autonomy\nwould be a value to reconsider to ensure adequate protection.\n\nApart from evaluating information technology against current moral\nnorms, one also needs to consider the possibility that technological\nchanges influence the norms themselves (Boenink, Swierstra &\nStemerding 2010). Technology thus does not only influence privacy by\nchanging the accessibility of information, but also by changing the\nprivacy norms themselves. For example, social networking sites invite\nusers to share more information than they otherwise might. This\n\u201coversharing\u201d becomes accepted practice within certain\ngroups. With future and emerging technologies, such influences can\nalso be expected and therefore they ought to be taken into account\nwhen trying to mitigate effects.\n\nAnother fundamental question is whether, given the future (and even\ncurrent) level of informational connectivity, it is feasible to\nprotect privacy by trying to hide information from parties who may use\nit in undesirable ways. Gutwirth & De Hert (2008) argue that it\nmay be more feasible to protect privacy by transparency \u2013 by\nrequiring actors to justify decisions made about individuals, thus\ninsisting that decisions are not based on illegitimate information.\nThis approach comes with its own problems, as it might be hard to\nprove that the wrong information was used for a decision. Still, it\nmay well happen that citizens, in turn, start data collection on those\nwho collect data about them, e.g. governments. Such\n\u201ccounter(sur)veillance\u201d may be used to gather information\nabout the use of information, thereby improving accountability\n(G\u00fcrses et al. 2016). The open source movement may also\ncontribute to transparency of data processing. In this context,\ntransparency can be seen as a pro-ethical condition contributing to\nprivacy (Turilli & Floridi 2009).\n\nIt has been argued that the precautionary principle, well known in\nenvironmental ethics, might have a role in dealing with emerging\ninformation technologies as well (Pieters & van Cleeff 2009; Som,\nHilty & K\u00f6hler 2009). The principle would see to it that the\nburden of proof for absence of irreversible effects of information\ntechnology on society, e.g. in terms of power relations and equality,\nwould lie with those advocating the new technology. Precaution, in\nthis sense, could then be used to impose restrictions at a regulatory\nlevel, in combination with or as an alternative to empowering users,\nthereby potentially contributing to the prevention of informational\noverload on the user side. Apart from general debates about the\ndesirable and undesirable features of the precautionary principle,\nchallenges to it lie in its translation to social effects and social\nsustainability, as well as to its application to consequences induced\nby intentional actions of agents. Whereas the occurrence of natural\nthreats or accidents is probabilistic in nature, those who are\ninterested in improper use of information behave strategically,\nrequiring a different approach to risk (i.e. security as opposed to\nsafety). In addition, proponents of precaution will need to balance it\nwith other important principles, viz., of informed consent and\nautonomy.\n\nFinally, it is appropriate to note that not all social effects of\ninformation technology concern privacy (Pieters 2017). Examples\ninclude the effects of social network sites on friendship, and the\nverifiability of results of electronic elections. Therefore,\nvalue-sensitive design approaches and impact assessments of\ninformation technology should not focus on privacy only, since\ninformation technology affects many other values as well.\n",
