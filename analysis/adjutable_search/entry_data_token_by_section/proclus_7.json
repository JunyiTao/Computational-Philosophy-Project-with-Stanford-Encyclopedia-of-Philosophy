    "main_text": "Philosophical views || Psychology and Epistemology\n3.3 Psychology and Epistemology\n\n\nProclus\u2019 epistemology is firmly rooted in his theory of the\nsoul. For Proclus, souls as self-moving principles represent the lowest\nlevel of entities that are capable of reverting upon itself (so called\nself-constituted beings [authypostata], see Elem.\nTheol. \u00a7 40\u201351). They are incorporeal, separable from\nbodies and indestructible/immortal (Elem.\nTheol. \u00a7 186\u20137). Yet, they are principles of life and of\nmovement of bodies (Elem. Theol. \u00a7 188). In accordance\nwith Proclus\u2019 general metaphysical principles (cf. above 3.1),\nfrom the unparticipated soul-monad proceed different kinds of\nparticipated soul: divine souls, daemonic souls, human souls, souls of\nanimals). As with other Platonists, Proclus frequently discusses the\nvexed question as to why a soul would descend into a body at all\n(\u2018fall of the soul\u2019) (see D\u00f6rrie / Baltes (2002.2)\n163\u2013218). Moreover, the Neoplatonist distinguishes between\naltogether three so-called vehicles (och\u00eamata) of the\nsoul. The rational soul is permanently housed in the luminous\nvehicle, while the non-rational soul is located in the pneumatic\nvehicle. By being incarnated in a human body, soul, or rather, the\nvegetative soul attains thus a (third) \u2018shell-like\u2019\nvehicle. The theory of the different vehicles or the psychic\n\u2018astral body,\u2019 familiar nowadays from modern theosophic theories,\nfulfils several crucial functions in Neoplatonic psychology: it\nexplains (a) how an incorporeal soul can be linked to a body, (b) how\nsouls can move in space, (c) how souls can be punished after death (cf.\nPlato\u2019s myths), (d) where certain faculties of\nthe soul such as imagination are located. Proclus distinguishes between two kinds\nof vehicles, one mortal and the other immortal (In\nTim. III 236.31 ff. and Elem. Theol. \u00a7\n207\u2013210). Proclus also adheres to the Platonic theory of\ntransmigration, but argues that human souls never enter animal bodies\nas their constitutive forms. For only animal souls can be organizing\nprinciples of animal bodies. If some rational souls are\n\u2018degraded\u2019 in the next life and forced to live in an animal\nbody because of their misdemeanour in this life, they are only\n\u2018relationally\u2019 (schesei) present to this animal\nbody.\n\n\nProclus distinguishes between the following faculties of soul: sense\nperception, imagination (phantasia), opinion, discursive\nthought, and intellection. While sense perception and imagination\nbelong to the non-rational soul, opinion forms the lowest level of\nrationality. The aim of epistemological ascent is to free oneself\neventually from the lower psychic faculties, including the lower\nrational ones, in order to enjoy a state of pure contemplation.\n\n\nAs with many other Platonists, Proclus\u2019 epistemology is based\non a theory of innate knowledge (in accordance with the\nPlatonic dictum that \u2018all learning is recollection\n[anamn\u00easis]\u2019). Proclus refers to the innate\ncontents of the soul as its reason-principles (logoi) or Forms\n(eid\u00ea). These innate reason-principles constitute the\nessence of soul. That is why they are called \u2018essential\nreason-principles\u2019 (logoi ousi\u00f4deis)\n(Steel 1997). The traditional translation reason-principles\nwas chosen on purpose, because on an ontological level these same\nlogoi serve as principles of all things. They are extended or\nunfolded images of the Forms that exist in intellect; and by means of\nthem the world-soul with the assistance of Nature brings forth\neverything. In other words, the psychic logoi are\ninstantiations of Platonic Forms on the level of soul as are the\nlogoi in Nature and the forms immanent in matter. According to\nthe fundamental Neoplatonic axiom panta en\npasin (\u2018all things are in all things\u2019), Forms\nexist on all levels of reality. But the logoi in soul also\noffer the principles of all knowledge and are the starting points of\ndemonstration. At In Parm. IV 894.3\u201318 (ed. Steel) Proclus\nargues that only with reference to these notions within the soul\npredication is possible (see Helmig 2008), since they are universal in\nthe true sense of the word. On the other hand, both transcendent\nPlatonic Forms and forms in matter are not taken to be universals\nproper by Proclus. The former are rather intelligible particulars, as\nit were, and cannot be defined (Steel 2004), while the latter are\nstrictly speaking instantiated or individualised universals that are\nnot shared by many particulars (see Helmig 2008, cf. above 3.1\u20132). For\nthis reason, it does not make much sense to talk about \u2018the\nproblem of universals\u2019 in Proclus.\n\n\nIt is another crucial assumption of Proclus\u2019 epistemology that\nall souls share the same logoi (Elem. Theol.\n\u00a7 194\u2013195). In terms of concept-formation this entails that\npsychic concepts, once they are grasped correctly, are universal,\nobjective, and shareable (see Helmig (2012) 13\u201324). Moreover, if all souls share the same\nlogoi, and these logoi are the principles of\nreality (see above), then by grasping the logoi souls come to\nknow the true principles or causes of reality. Already Aristotle had\nwritten that to know something signifies to know its cause\n(Met. A 3, 983a25\u201326 and An.\nPost. I 2, 71b9\u201312). In his Commentary on\nPlato\u2019s Timaeus, Proclus introduces an interesting\ndistinction. Taking his start from the problem of how we can recognise\ncertain objects, he considers the example of an apple. The different\nsenses tell us that there is something sweet, red, even, with a nice\nsmell. And while common sense (koin\u00ea\naisth\u00easis) can distinguish the different impressions of\nthe special senses, only opinion (doxa) is capable of saying\nthat the object there on the table is an apple. Doxa is able\nto do this, because it has access to the innate logoi of the\nsoul. However, as Proclus explains (In Tim. I 248.11\nff.), opinion only knows the \u2018that\u2019 (hoti), that\nis, it can recognize objects. Discursive thought (dianoia), on\nthe other hand, also knows the \u2018why\u2019 (dihoti),\nthat is, the causes of something. This distinction can also be\nrephrased in terms of concepts, implying a distinction between factual\nconcepts that allow us to identify or recognise certain objects, and\nconcepts that fulfil an explanatory role. On the whole, Proclus\u2019\nreading and systematisation of Plato\u2019s doctrine of learning as\nrecollection makes Platonic recollection not only concerned with higher\nlearning, since already on the level of object recognition we employ\nconcepts that originate from the innate logoi of the soul (Helmig (2012) 299\u2013333).\n\n\nProclus argues at length that the human soul has to contain innate\nknowledge. Therefore, one should not consider it an empty writing\ntablet, as Aristotle does (Aristotle, De anima III 4). He is\nwrong in asserting that the soul contains all things\npotentially. According to Proclus, the soul contains all things (i.e.,\nall logoi) in actuality, though due to the \u2018shock of\nbirth\u2019 it may seem as if the soul has fallen to\npotentiality. At In\nCrat. \u00a7 61, Proclus asserts that the soul does not\nresemble an empty writing tablet (agraphon\ngrammateion) and does not possess all things in potentiality,\nbut in act. In Eucl. 16.8\u201313 expresses the same\nidea: \u201cthe soul is not a writing tablet void of logoi,\nbut it is always written upon and always writing itself and being\nwritten on by the intellect.\u201d As with his philosophy of\nmathematics, Proclus presents a detailed criticism of the view that\nuniversal concepts are derived from sensible objects (by abstraction, induction, or\ncollection). In the fourth book of his Commentary on\nPlato\u2019s Parmenides and in the two prologues of the\nCommentary on Euclid we find the most comprehensive criticism\nof abstractionism in antiquity (see Helmig (2010) and (2012) 205\u2013221).\n",
