Skinner\u2019s Social Worldview\n\nSkinner is the only major figure in the history of behaviorism to\noffer a socio-political world view based on his commitment to\nbehaviorism. Skinner constructed a theory as well as narrative picture\nin Walden Two (1948) of what an ideal human society would be like if\ndesigned according to behaviorist principles (see also Skinner 1971).\nSkinner\u2019s social worldview illustrates his aversions to free\nwill, to homunculi, and to dualism as well as his positive reasons for\nclaiming that a person\u2019s history of environmental interactions\ncontrols his or her behavior.\n\nOne possible feature of human behavior which Skinner deliberately\nrejects is that people freely or creatively make their own\nenvironments (see Chomsky 1971, Black 1973). Skinner protests that\n\u201cit is in the nature of an experimental analysis of human\nbehavior that it should strip away the functions previously assigned\nto a free or autonomous person and transfer them one by one to the\ncontrolling environment\u201d (1971, p. 198).\n\nCritics have raised several objections to the Skinnerian social\npicture. One of the most persuasive, and certainly one of the most\nfrequent, adverts to Skinner\u2019s vision of the ideal human\nsociety. It is a question asked of the fictional founder of Walden\nTwo, Frazier, by the philosopher Castle. It is the question of what is\nthe best social or communal mode of existence for a human being.\nFrazier\u2019s, and therein Skinner\u2019s, response to this\nquestion is both too general and incomplete. Frazier/Skinner praises\nthe values of health, friendship, relaxation, rest, and so forth.\nHowever, these values are hardly the detailed basis of a social\nsystem.\n\nThere is a notorious difficulty in social theory of specifying the\nappropriate level of detail at which a blueprint for a new and ideal\nsociety must be presented (see Arnold 1990, pp. 4\u201310). Skinner\nidentifies the behavioristic principles and learning incentives that\nhe hopes will reduce systematic injustices in social systems. He also\ndescribes a few practices (concerning child rearing and the like) that\nare intended to contribute to human happiness. However, he offers only\nthe haziest descriptions of the daily lives of Walden Two citizens and\nno suggestions for how best to resolve disputes about alternative ways\nof life that are prima facie consistent with behaviorist principles\n(see Kane 1996, p. 203). He gives little or no serious attention to\nthe crucial general problem of inter-personal conflict resolution and\nto the role of institutional arrangements in resolving conflicts.\n\nIn an essay which appeared in The Behavior Analyst (1985), nearly\nforty years after the publication of Walden Two, Skinner, in the guise\nof Frazier, tried to clarify his characterization of ideal human\ncircumstances. He wrote that in the ideal human society \u201cpeople\njust naturally do the things they need to do to maintain themselves\n\u2026 and treat each other well, and they just naturally do a\nhundred other things they enjoy doing because they do not have to do\nthem\u201d (p. 9). However, of course, doing a hundred things humans\nenjoy doing means only that Walden Two is vaguely defined, not that\nits culturally instituted habits and the character of its institutions\nmerit emulation.\n\nThe incompleteness of Skinner\u2019s description of the ideal human\nsociety or life is so widely acknowledged that one might wonder if\nactual experiments in Walden Two living could lend useful detail to\nhis blueprint. More than one such social experiment has been\nconducted. Perhaps the most interesting (in part because the community\nhas evolved away from its Skinnerian roots) is the Twin Oaks Community\nin Virginia in the U.S.A., which can be indirectly explored via the\nInternet (see Other Internet Resources).\n",
