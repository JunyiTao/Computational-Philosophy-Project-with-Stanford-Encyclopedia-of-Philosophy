    "main_text": "Statistical Mechanics Requiring Information Processing || Demons exist\n3.6 Demons exist\n\n\nThere is, of course, another response to the Szilard engine, and\nMaxwell's demon in general. It is to argue that these demons do, in\nfact, exist. This has been suggested in recent years by Albert (2000)\nand developed by Hemmo and Shenker (2007). The principal argument\ndepends on the observation that, in macroscopically indeterministic\nprocesses, the Boltzmann entropy can go down. Adopting a Boltzmannian\npoint of view, Albert argued that the Boltzmannian entropy of the\nmacrostate that the system inhabits is the only meaningful measure of\nthermodynamic entropy. The fact that in indeterministic processes it\ncan be made to go down systematically is therefore just a fact of the\nworld. In the Szilard engine, inserting the partition in the centre of\nthe box is just such an indeterministic process that reduces the\nBoltzmann entropy regardless of which side the molecule is located. As\nthe demonless engines show, extracting the work from this reduction is\npossible, without the intervention of intelligence.\n\n\nHemmo and Shenker considered whether this work extraction requires a\nrecord to remain of the initial location of the molecule, as supporters\nof the Landauer-Penrose-Bennett resolution would suggest. They argue\nthat this is not necessary. Instead they perform an operation\nequivalent to \u2018erasure-by-destruction\u2019, on the auxiliary system. This\ndestroys any remaining macroscopic trace of the information about where\nthe molecule was located, without incurring any thermodynamic cost (see\nalso Maroney (2005), who considered similar processes from within a\nGibbsian framework), but leaves the auxiliary in one of several low\nBoltzmann entropy macrostates.\n\n\nHowever, it seems also clearly acknowledged in these arguments that\nthe reduction can only be achieved through macroscopically\nindeterministic processes. The system and auxiliary cannot\nboth be restored to their initial macrostate with certainty,\nwithout heat being generated. It would appear that the violation is\nstill constrained and the demon may be tame. Albert, at least, appeared\nto acknowledge this, and the corresponding possibility that a modified\nsecond law may still be possible.\n\n\nFinally, it may be noted that it is possible to conceive of untamed\nMaxwell's demons, that produce unconstrained violations of the second\nlaw, by simply modifying the microscopic laws in order to make it so.\nZhang and Zhang (1992) provided an example of this replacing the\npartition in the centre of Maxwell's box with a velocity dependant\npotential capable of creating a pressure difference in the gas. This\npotential is non-Hamiltonian, so Liouville's Theorem does not hold. The\nphase volume of the macrostate of the gas can then be compressed and\nboth the Boltzmann and Gibbs entropies can be systematically reduced\neven in macroscopically deterministic processes. Such examples, while\nnot necessarily being presented as candidates for demons that can be\nconstructed in the real world, are nevertheless useful in clarifying\nwhat attendant assumptions are being made when exorcisms are\nproposed.\n",
