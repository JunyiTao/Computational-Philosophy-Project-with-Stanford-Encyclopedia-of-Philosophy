    "main_text": "The Causal Mechanical Model || The CM Model and Complex Systems\n4.3 The CM Model and Complex Systems\n\nA second set of worries has to do with the application of the\nCM model to systems which depart in various respects from\nsimple physical paradigms such as the collision described above. There\nare a number of examples of such systems. First, there are theories\nlike Newtonian gravitational theory which involve \u201caction at a\ndistance\u201d in a physically interesting sense. Second, there are a\nnumber of examples from the literature on causation that do not\ninvolve physically interesting forms of action at a distance but which\narguably involve causal interactions without intervening\nspatio-temporally continuous processes or transfer of energy and\nmomentum from cause to effect. These include cases of causation by\nomission and causation by \u201cdouble prevention\u201d or\n \u201cdisconnection.\u201d[6]\n In all these cases, a literal application of the CM model\nseems to yield the judgment that no explanation has been\nprovided\u2014that Newtonian gravitational theory is unexplanatory\nand so on. Many philosophers have been reluctant to accept this\nassessment.\n\nYet another class of examples that raise problems for the CM\nmodel involves putative explanations of the behavior of complex or\n\u201chigher level\u201d systems\u2014explanations that do not\nexplicitly cite spatio-temporally continuous causal processes\ninvolving transfer of energy and momentum, even though we may think\nthat such processes are at work at a more \u201cunderlying\u201d\nlevel. Most explanations in disciplines like biology, psychology and\neconomics fall under this description, as do a number of\nstraightforwardly physical explanations.\n\nAs an illustration, suppose that a mole of gas is confined to a\ncontainer of volume \\(V_1,\\) at pressure \\(P_1,\\) and temperature\n\\(T_1\\). The gas is then allowed to expand isothermally into a larger\ncontainer of volume \\(V_2\\). One standard way of explaining the\nbehavior of the gas\u2014its rate of diffusion and its subsequent\nequilibrium pressure \\(P_2\\)\u2014appeals to the generalizations of\nphenomenological thermodynamics\u2014e.g., the ideal gas law,\nGraham\u2019s law of diffusion, and so on. Salmon appears to regard\nputative explanations based on at least the first of these\ngeneralizations as not explanatory because they do not trace\ncontinuous causal processes\u2014he thinks of the individual\nmolecules as causal processes but not the gas as a\n whole.[7]\n However, it is plainly impossible to trace the causal processes and\ninteractions represented by each of the \\(6 \\times 10^{23}\\) molecules\nmaking up the gas and the successive interactions (collisions) it\nundergoes with every other molecule. Even the usual statistical\nmechanical treatment, which Salmon presumably would regard as\nexplanatory, does not attempt to do this. Instead, it makes certain\ngeneral assumptions about the distribution of molecular velocities and\nthe forces involved in molecular collisions and then uses these, in\nconjunction with the laws of mechanics, to derive and solve a\ndifferential equation (the Boltzmann transport equation) describing\nthe overall behavior of the gas. This treatment abstracts radically\nfrom the details of the causal processes involving particular\nindividual molecules and instead focuses on identifying higher level\nvariables that aggregate over many individual causal processes and\nthat figure in general patterns that govern the behavior of the\ngas.\n\nThis example raises a number of questions. Just what does the\nCM model require in the case of complex systems in which we\ncannot trace individual causal processes, at least at a fine-grained\nlevel? How exactly does the causal mechanical model avoid the\n(disastrous) conclusion that any successful explanation of the\nbehavior of the gas must trace the trajectories of individual\nmolecules? Does the statistical mechanical explanation described above\nsuccessfully trace causal processes and interactions or specify a\ncausal mechanism in the sense demanded by the CM model, and\nif so, what exactly does tracing causal processes and interactions\ninvolve or amount to in connection with such a system? A fully\nadequate development of the CM model needs to address such\nquestions.\n\nThere is another aspect of this example that is worthy of comment.\nSuppose that a particular sample of gas expands in a way that meets\nthe conditions described above and that it is somehow possible to\nprovide an account that traces each of the individual molecular\ntrajectories of its component molecules. Such an account would\nnonetheless leave out information that seems explanatorily relevant.\nThis information has to do with the fact that there are a large number\nof alternative trajectories besides the actual trajectories followed\nby the component molecules on this particular occasion that would lead\nto the same final pressure \\(P_2\\) which is what we want to explain.\nModal information of this sort\u2014both about what would happen if\nthe molecules followed different trajectories consistent with the\ninitial conditions \\(P_1\\), \\(V_1\\) and \\(T_1\\) and what would happen if they instead followed initial conditions consistent trajectories consistent with different macroscopic initial conditions is better captured by a treatment in terms of upper level thermodynamic variables.\n",
