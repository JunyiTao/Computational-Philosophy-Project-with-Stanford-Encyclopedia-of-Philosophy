    "main_text": "Critical Reactions\n3. Critical Reactions\n\nCriticism of Dewey\u2019s aesthetics dates from even before Art\nas Experience. Curt Ducasse (1929), for example, believed that\nDewey\u2019s instrumentalism generates a strange theory which holds\nthat human life is a matter of tool-making, all tools are essentially\ntools for tool-making, and only satisfactions arising from tool-making\nshould be acknowledged (see Alexander 1998). He also criticized Dewey\nfor not allowing for meaningless satisfactions and anarchistic\npleasures. Aesthetic perception of colors and tones as such does not\nneed any presence of meaning; nor does appreciation of rainbows or\nsunsets. Meaning also need not be present in things of pure design. He\nagreed with Schopenhauer, contra Dewey, that aesthetic contemplation\nrequires not attending to meanings. Also, because the creation of art\nmay on occasion occur in one stroke, it too can be without meaning.\nFurther, it is only by accident that the feeling expressed in the\ncreation of art is due to the perceived situation. Emotions are not\nalways responses to concrete situations and many emotions are about\nnothing. Artistic expression of emotion should be distinguished from\nutilitarian expression. It is only the latter that deals with the\nobject of emotion.\n\nAnother early critic, Edna Shearer (1935a), thought that Dewey buried\nart under extraneous ethical and political considerations. She\nrejected the idea that all life ought to be like art in combining the\nconsummatory and the instrumental. Dewey\u2019s desire to overcome\nthe means/ends distinction is also problematic since a work of art\ndoes not seriously contain as ingredients the process that led to its\nproduction. The perfect amalgamation of means and ends is utopian.\nFurther, toil just cannot be eliminated from society or from the\ncreative process.\n\nArt as Experience early on had the misfortune of receiving\ntwo reviews that negatively impacted its reception. The first, by an\navowed follower, Stephen Pepper, complained that it was not truly\npragmatist and that Dewey had reverted to an earlier Hegelianism\n(Pepper 1939). The second, by Benedetto Croce, seemed to confirm this\n(Croce 1948). Croce, widely seen as Hegelian himself, saw so many\nsimilarities between Dewey\u2019s work and his own that he accused\nDewey of lifting his ideas. Dewey (1948) insisted otherwise, but the\nsense that there was something too Hegelian in Art as\nExperience remained. This did not stop many philosophers,\neducators, and other intellectuals from producing works in aesthetic\ntheory that were strongly influenced by Dewey. Even before Art as\nExperience Dewey\u2019s writings on aesthetics and art\ninfluenced, and were influenced by, such writers as Mary Mullen\n(1923), who taught seminars on aesthetics and was Associate Director\nof Education for the Barnes Foundation; Lawrence Buermeyer (1924), who\nwas another Associate Director of Education at the Barnes Foundation;\nAlbert Barnes himself (1928); and Thomas Munro (1928). After the\nbook\u2019s publication his followers included Irwin Edman (1939),\nStephen Pepper (1939, 1945, 1953), Horace Kallen (1942), Thomas Munro\nagain (numerous books) and Van Meter Ames (1947, 1953). Art historian\nMeyer Schapiro was one of his students.\n\nAfter the publication of Art as Experience there emerged a\nlong chain of both criticism and defense. Eliseo Vivas (1937) argued\nthat Dewey holds two theories about the emotions\u2019 role in\naesthetic experience, one that the esthetic object arouses emotion in\nthe spectator, and the other that the content of meaning of art,\nobjectively speaking, is emotion. But, he argued, experimental\naesthetics has shown that emotion is an accidental consequence of\naesthetic apprehension, and so should not be included in its\ndefinition. The same aesthetic object can arouse different emotional\nreactions in different spectators. Some trained persons in music even\ndeny that adequate aesthetic experience involves emotion. Dewey also\nhas not given an explanation of the means by which the object\nexpresses emotion. Vivas himself defined aesthetic experience in terms\nof rapt attention involving apprehension of the object\u2019s\nimmanent meanings.\n\nIn a second article (Vivas 1938), he asked: Are emotions attached to\nthe material? How is this consistent with the idea that emotion is not\nexpressed in the object? And how are these ideas consistent with the\nidea that emotion is aroused in the spectator? Vivas insisted that not\nall art arouses emotion in everyone who has effective intercourse with\nit. Music, for sophisticated listeners, is often not suggestive of\nemotions. When we find \u201csadness\u201d in music we would do\nbetter to call it an objective character of the music than an emotion.\nAnother problem for Dewey: if the self disappears in experience then\nhow can the object arouse emotion in the self or have emotion attached\nto it? Also, if the self disappears into harmony, how can there be the\nkind of disharmony associated with emotion?\n\nWe have already mentioned Pepper\u2019s objection that Dewey\u2019s\ntheory is not sufficiently pragmatic (Pepper 1939). His specific\nobjection was that Dewey\u2019s views were eclectic, incorporating\nelements both of pragmatism and of Hegelian organicism. Pepper\nbelieved that both theories, as well as formalism, can be valuable\nwhen taken separately, but that the mixture in Dewey hurts pragmatism.\nPepper identified organicism with the view that the ultimate reality\nis The Absolute. Dewey replied (1939) that he had based his aesthetic\ntheory on examination of the subject-matter and not on any a\npriori theory. Words he used, such as \u201ccoherence\u201d,\n\u201cwhole\u201d, \u201cintegration\u201d, and\n\u201ccomplete\u201d, were intended to have meaning consistent with\nhis pragmatic empiricism and did not by themselves indicate a\ncommitment to idealism. Moreover, it was one of his main points that\nalthough these terms were applicable to aesthetic matters\nthey could not, contra the idealists, be extended to the world as a\nwhole. The terms had a special sense applying only to experiences as\naesthetic. Dewey rejected any theory of a great cosmic harmony\nassociated with the Hegelian notion of the Absolute.\n\nIn a later work, Pepper (1945) agreed with Dewey that each reading of\na poem brings a new experience, but thought that, since there is also\nidentity of context that can make the differences minor, we can speak\nof an identical quality running through the different situations.\nPepper had many positive things to say about Dewey\u2019s\n\u201ccontextualism\u201d (his word for pragmatism in aesthetics),\nbut he insisted that there is much more permanence of aesthetic values\nin the world than Dewey would admit. A great work of art may be\nappreciated as long as the physical work exists and someone exists to\nperceive it, and insofar as it appeals to common instincts, it may\nappeal to people of varied cultures.\n\nIsabel Creed (1945) complained that Dewey leaves no place for works\nthat celebrate equilibrium achieved, or for works that result from the\nartist playing around with the medium. Nor does Dewey explain\naccidentally encountered aesthetic experiences of natural objects. She\nthought, contra Dewey, that struggle with our environment is not\nnecessary for aesthetic experience.\n\nCroce, mentioned earlier, rightly pointed out many similarities\nbetween his own and Dewey\u2019s thought (Croce 1948). There were,\nhowever, still three points of serious contention: (1) Croce placed\nsignificantly more importance on the universality of art than Dewey,\n(2) he still insisted that the material of art consists not of\nexternal things but of internal sentiments of human passions: a\ncharacteristically idealist position that Dewey vehemently rejected,\nand (3) whereas he believed that art gives knowledge of a higher\nreality, Dewey did not. Croce asserted that Dewey is still arguing\nagainst Hegelians of his youth who held, for example, to a notion of\n\u201cthe Absolute\u201d, which Croce had rejected. Dewey (1948), in\nresponding to Croce, argued that the list of shared beliefs Croce\nmentioned in his review were just ideas widely familiar to\naestheticians. He thought that because of Croce\u2019s idealism there\ncan be no common ground of discussion between them. In return, Croce\n(1952) argued that Dewey is too wedded to empiricism and pragmatism\nand that it is only because Dewey, contrary to his own claims, is\ncommitted to a kind of dualism, that he cannot understand\nCroce\u2019s identification of intuition and expression or recognize\nhow similar Croce\u2019s view is to his own. Frederic Simoni (1952)\nargued that neither Croce nor Dewey was Hegelian in the sense of\nbelieving in the Absolute. George Douglas (1970) agreed with Simoni,\nfinding many similarities between Dewey and Croce. However, Douglas\ndid agree with Pepper (1939) that Dewey never reconciled the\npragmatist and historicist (Hegelian) dimensions of his thought (cf.\nVittorio 2012, Copenhaver 2017).\n\nPatrick Romanell (1949) held that Croce and Dewey at least share the\nview that art is about aesthetic experience. However, Dewey\u2019s\ndefinition of the subject matter of philosophy of art as aesthetic\nexperience (which treats it as a special type of experience) is\ninconsistent with his definition of it as the aesthetic phase of\nexperience. Also, when Dewey speaks of aesthetic experience he is not\nfunctionalist and is not consistent with his pragmatism. Dewey should\nhave held that just as there is no such thing as religious experience,\nthere is no such thing as aesthetic experience. Dewey (1950) replied\nthat every normally complete experience is aesthetic in its\nconsummatory phase, that the arts and their experience are\ndevelopments of this primary phase, and that there is nothing\ninconsistent in this. Where Romanell saw incompatibility Dewey saw\ncontinuity of development. Van Meter Ames (1953), however, defended\nDewey against critics up to this point in time.\n\nGeorge Boas (1953) argued that Dewey yearns for universality in art\nwhere none can be found. He believed that Dewey wrongly takes the term\n\u201cart\u201d to have only one meaning where it has many.\nMoreover, while some art communicates, other art conceals: it is wrong\nto say that all art, or even that all great art, communicates\nuniversally. Also, not everyone who practices art is interested in\ncommunion and democracy. Some art is intended for communion with God,\nnot with humanity; some art is intended for communion with no one but\nthe artist him or herself.\n\nOne of the leading aestheticians of the time, Susanne Langer (1953)\nsaw pragmatism in general, and Dewey in particular, as guilty of\npsychologism and therefore unable to deal with the issues that really\nchallenge aestheticians. Pragmatism\u2019s assumption is that all\nhuman interests are manifestations of drives motivated by animal\nneeds, thus reducing human to animal psychology. Aesthetic values are\nthereby interpreted either as direct satisfactions or as instrumental\nto fulfilling psychological needs, making artistic experience no\ndifferent from ordinary experience. This misses the essence of art,\nwhat makes it as important as science or religion. Whereas Dewey held\nthat there is no essential difference between art experience and\nordinary experience Langer thought that the appreciative attitude\ntoward art is not at all like that toward a new car or a beautiful\nmorning. But Felicia Kruse (2007) argued that Langer misinterpreted\nDewey on several points and was actually much closer to Dewey than she\nthought.\n\nIn the 1950s there was an analytic revolution in English-speaking\naesthetics. Prior aesthetic theories were considered to be too\nspeculative and unclear. Dewey\u2019s work was caught up in this\ncondemnation. Arnold Isenberg, for instance, in a founding document of\nanalytic aesthetics, originally published in 1950, dismissed Art\nas Experience as a \u201chodgepodge of conflicting methods and\nundisciplined speculations\u201d, (1950 [1987: 128]) although he\nfound it full of profound suggestions. Dewey\u2019s theories of\nexpression and creativity were particular targets of analytic attack.\nHis was among the views singled out in a general critique of\nexpression as a defining characteristic of art, although often his own\ndistinctive theory was ignored in the process. A situation followed,\nand continued well into the 1980s, in which, according to one editor\nof The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, Dewey\u2019s\naesthetics was virtually ignored (Fisher 1989). While Monroe\nBeardsley, one of the most important late twentieth century\naestheticians, kept an interest in Dewey alive (1958, 1975, 1982),\nparticularly in his discussions of aesthetic experience, other major\nfigures, including Arthur Danto, Mary Mothersill and Richard Wollheim,\ncompletely ignored him. Nelson Goodman may be a partial exception\n(Freeland 2001). He certainly shared with Dewey a conviction that art\nand science are close in many ways. And, like Dewey, he replaced the\nquestion \u201cwhat is art?\u201d with \u201cwhen is art?\u201d\nThey also both took a naturalist approach to the arts. However,\nGoodman, who never refers to Dewey in his Languages of Art\n(1976), saw art in terms of languages and other symbol systems,\nwhereas Dewey saw it in terms of experience.\n\nEdward Ballard (1957), in a move characteristic of the rise of\nanalytic philosophy in aesthetics, asserted that Dewey rejects many\ndistinctions that are necessary for philosophy, and that this leads to\na kind of irrationalism which results in his depending on problematic\nmetaphors like \u201cfunding\u201d and \u201cenergy\u201d. He\nthought Dewey\u2019s avoidance of specific techniques in forming\ntheories, for example the technique of formal definition, to be\nanti-intellectual. Dewey\u2019s rejection of universals as illusions\nand his enthusiastic acceptance of nominalism must ultimately fail,\nfor theory requires logically inter-related propositions that refer to\nconcepts.\n\nCharles Gauss (1960), like Pepper before him, protested that\nDewey\u2019s organicism in Art as Experience disconnects\nfrom his earlier pragmatism. Pragmatism, unlike organicism, focuses on\ninteraction with a background that is partially inorganic. Also,\ncontra Dewey, he maintained that aesthetic enjoyment is not a\nparticular kind of enjoyment, but enjoyment of aesthetic\ncharacteristics.\n\nMarshall Cohen (1977, originally 1965) complained, also in the\nanalytic vein, about the vagueness of Dewey\u2019s terms. He\nespecially wondered whether unity can really distinguish\naesthetic from non-aesthetic experience. He reasoned that the\nexperience of being badly beaten can have as much unity as hearing a\nsonata. Moreover, aesthetic experience can often have the\ndiscontinuous character that Dewey ascribes only to practical\nexperience.\n\nContemporary American aesthetician Arnold Berleant began his career\n(1970) in a way that was much more sympathetic to Dewey. He has, in\nhis many writings, developed themes similar to Dewey\u2019s, for\nexample, in his concepts of the \u201caesthetic field\u201d and\n\u201cengagement\u201d (1970; 1991). His work on the aesthetics of\nthe environment had a strong influence on the recently emergent field\nof everyday aesthetics which we will discuss below.\n\nBy contrast, Roger Scruton (1974) objected mainly to Dewey\u2019s\nnaturalism. He interpreted Dewey as insisting that aesthetic need must\nunderlie all our interest in art, and believed that Dewey fails to\ncapture what we mean when we say that we are interested in a picture\n\u201cfor its own sake\u201d. Needs can be satisfied by many objects\nbut one cannot substitute pictures for one another. Unlike animal\nneed, interest in a picture involves thought of its object. As a\npolitical conservative, Scruton has been opposed to Dewey\u2019s\nviews on education. However, his work on architecture (Scruton 1979),\nwith its emphasis on context, unity, functionalism, and the relations\nbetween architecture and everyday aesthetics, is remarkably similar to\nDewey\u2019s views about art in general, although Dewey\u2019s name\nis never mentioned.\n\nJohn McDermott (1976), one of the leaders of the American Philosophy\ntradition in the later part of the twentieth century, followed Dewey\nin arguing that all experience is potentially aesthetic, where the\naesthetic sensibility refers to how we feel about our situation. Art\ntoday leads us to life. In order to achieve consummatory experience we\nneed to cooperate with our environment.\n\nAlthough Monroe Beardsley (1982) often spoke positively of\nDewey\u2019s notion of aesthetic experience, he thought that Dewey\nwas obsessed with the dangers of dualism and that he talked about\n\u201cseparation\u201d in a misleading way. Dewey thinks the\npractices of hanging paintings in special buildings would deny\ncontinuity between art and life. Yet Beardsley sees no real problem\nhere, for people who see a painting in a museum bring their culture\nwith them. Also, against Dewey\u2019s stress on continuity, Beardsley\nthought that discontinuity in nature and in culture is\nrequired for the emergence of genuine novelty in art. As opposed to\nDewey, Beardsley stressed the ways in which art is independent,\nrelatively self-sufficient, and autonomous to a degree. Alan Goldman\n(2005) argued that Beardsley borrows too much from Dewey\u2019s\nobscure discussion of experience, but articulates better than Dewey\nthe idea that aesthetic experience is a matter of complete engagement\nof our faculties with both instrumental and intrinsic benefits. More\nrecently, Goldman (2013) has developed what he calls \u201cthe broad\nview of aesthetic experience\u201d, whose similarities to\nDewey\u2019s view he readily acknowledges.\n\nJoseph Margolis (1980) is perhaps the most important contemporary\naesthetician coming out of the analytic school to take Dewey\nseriously, having a natural affinity to pragmatist ways of thought.\nHis idea that works of art are culturally emergent but physically\nembodied entities is Deweyan in spirit, as is his insistence on a\nrobust relativist theory of interpretation. However, Margolis seldom\nrefers to Dewey and, although he believes himself closer to\nDewey\u2019s \u201cHegelianism\u201d than to Peirce\u2019s\n\u201cKantianism\u201d, he finds Peirce more interesting. He also\nfaults Dewey for not being an historicist (1999).\n\nThe relative lack of interest in Dewey changed for several reasons in\nthe late 1970s. First, Richard Rorty turned analytic philosophy on its\nhead by advocating a return to pragmatism (Rorty 1979, 1982). In this,\nDewey was one of his avowed heroes. Unfortunately, Rorty was not a\nclose reader of Dewey\u2019s aesthetics.\n\nDewey\u2019s aesthetics finally received an excellent exposition in\nthe work of Thomas Alexander (1987). Alexander developed his ideas\nfurther in a book on eco-ontology and the aesthetics of existence\n(2013). Mark Johnson, in a project inspired by cognitive science, drew\non Dewey\u2019s anti-dualism to develop a theory of the aesthetics of\nhuman understanding (2007, 2018). Meanwhile, there has been a steady\ninterest in Dewey\u2019s aesthetics in the philosophy of education,\nwith articles appearing on a regular basis in such publications as the\nJournal of Aesthetic Education and Studies in the\nPhilosophy of Education and several books (Jackson 1998, Garrison\n1997, Greene 2001, Maslak 2006, Granger 2006). Ueno (2015) continued\nin this tradition, stressing the importance of aesthetics in\nDewey\u2019s theory of democracy and education during a period of\nurbanization and industrialization.\n\nDewey\u2019s renewed influence was due in part to increased interest\nin various continental aestheticians. The similarities between Dewey\nand Maurice Merleau-Ponty are the most striking (Ames 1953, Kestenbaum\n1977), but he also shares certain features with Hans-Georg Gadamer\n(Gilmour 1987, who also notes important differences, and Jeannot\n2001). Given his critique of capitalism, one can also find connections\nbetween his thinking and that of Marxist aestheticians, particularly\nTheodor Adorno (Lysaker 1998), although there are important\ndifferences, especially where Adorno advocates the autonomy of art\nwhile Dewey stresses continuity (Lewis 2005, Eldridge 2010).\n\nThere has also been some work on marked similarities between\nDewey\u2019s aesthetic thought and that of Taoism (Grange 2001),\nTranscendental Meditation (Zigler 1982), Dogen\u2019s version of Zen\n(Earls 1992), the great Indian aesthetician Abhinavagupta (Mathur\n1981), the Bhagavad-Gita (Stroud 2009), and Confucius (Shusterman\n2009, Man 2007, Mullis 2005, Grange 2004). Alexander has recently\ndiscussed relations between Dewey and Eastern aesthetics generally\n(Alexander 2009).\n\nAs mentioned earlier, many attacks on Dewey focused on his views on\nexpression. Tormey (1986) for example chided Dewey for assuming that\nan artist is always expressing something and that the expressive\nqualities in the work are the result of that act. He thought that\nDewey wrongly abandons the distinction between voluntary and\ninvoluntary expression, and in doing so, undermines paradigmatic\nexamples of expressive behavior. A work of art may possess expressive\nqualities of sadness but this is not necessarily the intended\nconsequence of the productive activity of the artist. For Alan Tormey,\nthe artist is not expressing him or herself: he/she is simply making\nan expressive object. Michael Mitias (1992) defended Dewey against\nthese criticisms.\n\nDavid Novitz (1992), who approved of Dewey\u2019s ideas that art\nderives from experiences of everyday life and that the artistic\nprocess infuses our daily lives, questioned the idea that fine art\nalways embodies consummatory or unified experiences. He thought Dewey\nhas an idealized view of art that borrows from the very aestheticist\ntheories he criticizes. Further, Dewey does not sufficiently question\nthe boundaries of art.\n\nRichard Shusterman (1992, etc., see bibliography) is the most widely\nknown advocate of Dewey\u2019s pragmatist aesthetics. He especially\nemphasized the possibilities of treating popular art as fine art with\nhis well-known example of rap as fine art. He also extended aesthetics\ninto the realm of everyday life with his concept of\n\u201csomaesthetics\u201d (2012). Shusterman strikingly contrasted\nDewey\u2019s approach to that of analytic aesthetics. Like Dewey, he\nstressed the idea that art and aesthetics are both culturally and\nphilosophically central. Some of his most trenchant comments involved\nsimilarities between Dewey\u2019s thought and that of such\ncontinental thinkers as Foucault and Adorno. However he also had his\ncriticisms of Dewey. He took Dewey to be redefining art in terms of\naesthetic experience, which he believed to be too slippery a concept\nto explain much. Moreover, he asserted that although Dewey has much to\nsay about aesthetic experience, Dewey also holds that it is\nindefinable, and this leads to problems with its being a criterion of\nvalue in art. On the other hand, Shusterman thought that Dewey sees\ndefining art in terms of experience as a matter of getting us to have\nmore and better experiences with art, and not of giving a definition\nin terms of necessary and sufficient conditions. So, although he\ndoubted that philosophical theory can redefine art, he suspected Dewey\nis not trying to do this anyway. Moreover, he thought it not only\npossible but valuable to make less dramatic classificatory changes, as\nfor example in legitimating rock music as fine art. He believed that\nwhereas Dewey sought a global redefinition of art, he was simply\ntrying to remedy certain limitations in art practice. Later, he said\nthat much art fails to generate Dewey\u2019s aesthetic experience\n(Shusterman 2000). He also observed that art cannot be redefined to be\nequivalent to aesthetic experience, as we are hardly going to\nreclassify an incredible experience of a sunset as art. Shusterman\nalso insisted on the value of aesthetic experiences that are\nfragmented and ruptured, contrary to Dewey\u2019s emphasis on unity,\nand noted that Dewey neglected the possibility of lingering reflection\nafter moments of consummation (Shusterman 2004). Paul C. Taylor\naddressed Shusterman\u2019s criticism of Dewey as trying to find a\ndefinition of art arguing that Dewey provides \n\n\na very different kind of definition, one offered in full view of its\nsociohistorical contingency and pragmatic fuzziness. (Taylor 2002: 24)\n\n\n\nThis strand of pro-Deweyan thinking was also pursued by Crispin\nSartwell in response to multi-culturalism and everyday aesthetics\n(Sartwell 1995, 2003). In the later instance Sartwell connected\neveryday aesthetics to Dewey in the ideas that art arises from non-art\nactivities and that the domain of aesthetics goes well beyond the fine\narts.\n\nSome contemporary feminist aestheticians have noted that Dewey shares\nmany of their concerns, for example their rejection of mind/body\ndualism, their democratic instincts, their contextualism, and their\ntendency to break down traditional distinctions (Seigfried 1996, Duran\n2001). Charlene Seigfried found several aspects in Dewey\u2019s\nthought that may enrich feminist exploration of women\u2019s\nexperiences, including his antidualism, his perspectivalism, his\nworking from concrete experience, his emphasis on the role of feeling\nin experience, his stress on doing and making, and his attack on the\ndivision between practice and theory. However, she noted that Dewey\nneglected sexism in his analysis, and sometimes made sexist\nassumptions.\n\nNo\u00ebl Carroll (2001) thought that Dewey\u2019s theory of art\nfails to cover many contemporary works which then act as\ncounterexamples to his definition of art as experience. For example,\nas Rothko\u2019s paintings can overwhelm us at one shot, their\nexperience may not have Dewey\u2019s requisite development and\nclosure. Carroll also thought that the view that experiences of art\nmust be unified is too narrow. Cage\u2019s\n4\u203233\u2033, which Carroll takes to obviously be a work\nof art, does not consummate or have qualitative unity. Finally, he\nthought that if experiences of everyday dispersion can be aesthetic\nthen Dewey\u2019s distinction between \u201can experience\u201d and\ndisconnected daily experience dissolves. This might be contrasted to\nPhilip Jackson\u2019s (1998) defense of Dewey against similar\ncriticisms, especially with respect to Cage\u2019s\n4\u203233\u2033 which he saw as fitting Dewey\u2019s\ndefinition nicely. For Jackson, it is the experience that\nrequires unity, not the physical product.\n\nGeorge Dickie (2001) said that Dewey sets forth an expression theory\nof art without any supporting argument. Lumping Dewey with\nCollingwood, he thought such theorists place art in the same domain\nwith the growl of a dog with a bone. They made the creation of art\nlike the bowerbird\u2019s production of bowers, i.e., a result of\ninnate natures without a plan in mind. For Dickie, expression of\nemotion is neither sufficient nor necessary for defining art. He\nthought these theories wrongly hold that psychological mechanisms in\nhuman nature are sufficient for the production of art, as if the\nproduction of artworks is teleologically determined by such.\n\nIn her popular introductory textbook, Cynthia Freeland (2001) observed\nthat Dewey held that art is the best window to another culture, that\nit is a universal language, and that we should try to experience\nanother culture as from within since barriers and prejudices can melt\naway when we enter into the spirit of another culture\u2019s art.\nAlthough this universalism seems similar to Clive Bell\u2019s\nformalism, Freeland noted that for Dewey art is defined not as form\nbut as expression of the life of a community. She thought, however,\nthat we must also know many external facts about the community, and\nthat we must recognize that no culture is homogeneous: there may not\nbe one viewpoint in a culture. She also gave a positive nod\nto Dewey\u2019s call for a revolution in which the values leading to\nintelligent enjoyment of art are incorporated into our social\nrelations. Finally, she classified Dewey\u2019s aesthetics as a\ncognitive theory since it focuses on art\u2019s role in helping\npeople to perceive and manipulate reality. Thus she found continuity\nbetween Dewey\u2019s and Goodman\u2019s approaches to art as a kind\nof language.\n\nDewey\u2019s thought in aesthetics has also sometimes been brought to\nbear in analysis of other aspects of his philosophy. Noteworthy is the\nethical work of Gregory Pappas (2008), especially his chapter titled\n\u201cThe Intelligent, Aesthetic, and Democratic Way of Life\u201d.\nHere he discusses Dewey\u2019s aesthetic notion of balance as it\napplies to ethics. Mark Johnson (1994) and Steven Fesmire (2003) also\nintroduce Dewey\u2019s aesthetic theories into discussion of ethics.\nScott Stroud (2011), previously mentioned, further develops the\nDeweyan idea of moral self-cultivation, while Nathan Crick (2010)\napplies Dewey\u2019s aesthetic ideas to a conception of rhetoric as\nan art which in a democracy promotes freedom.\n\nRecently there have been lively debates over the Deweyan tradition in\nthe aesthetics of everyday life. Most of the contestants are inspired\nby Dewey\u2019s valuation of everyday aesthetic experience but depart\nfrom him in various ways. Sherri Irvin (2008a) has argued that the\nfragmented character of everyday aesthetic experiences might, contra\nDewey\u2019s emphasis on consummation, be what gives them their\ndistinctive quality. She goes so far as to assert that even scratching\nan itch can be aesthetically appreciated (Irvin 2008b). Glenn Parsons\nand Allen Carlson (2008) contend that, although Dewey\u2019s\naesthetic theory may seem particularly appropriate to appreciating\neveryday objects since we interact with them in a more intimate and\nmulti-sensory way than with art objects, this approach, shared by\nKorsmeyer (1999), Brady (2005), Leddy (2005, 2012), Shusterman (2006,\n2012), and Saito (2007), fails to honor traditional distinctions\nbetween aesthetic and mere \u201cbodily\u201d pleasures. They might\nhave also mentioned Glenn Kuehn (2005) who takes an explicitly Deweyan\napproach to the aesthetics of food, and Katya Mandoki (2007) who takes\nDewey as one source of her everyday aesthetics. They think it wrong\nthat the pleasures of taking a bath, for example, could be considered\naesthetic. Rather, the objects of everyday aesthetics should be\nappreciated mainly for their functional beauty (pleasures of the\nproximal senses are not aesthetic, although they may still add some\nvalue to the overall experience), and knowledge of the function of\neveryday objects is required for their appropriate appreciation. Brian\nSoucek (2009) and Christopher Dowling (2010) raise criticisms against\neveryday aesthetics along similar lines. However, Kalle Puolakka\n(2014, 2015, 2017, 2018) defends a Deweyan approach to everyday\naesthetics drawing on Dewey\u2019s theory of imagination and on\nrecent work on Dewey and moral imagination.\n\nDewey continues to have influence with respect to particular art\nforms. For example David Clowney and Robert Rawlins (2014) use Dewey\nto argue that risk-taking and showmanship are integral to music as\nperformed, and Aili Bresnahan (2014) develops a Deweyan theory of\nperforming arts practice with a special view to dance.\n\nA significant recent development in philosophical aesthetics has been\nthe placing of more attention on biology. Along these lines, Alva\nNo\u00eb (2015) has taken a markedly Deweyan stance in discussion of\nart as strange tools. He writes that although we can take seeing as\nsomething that happens in the head, it is, in \u201cDewey\u2019s\nimage, a transaction of doing and undergoing\u201d (No\u00eb 2015:\n78). He agrees with Dewey that lives are not made up of a series of\nsensations, but are \n\n\ncomposed of experiences that demand to be named\u2014that dinner\nin Venice\u2026 [etc.]. (2015: 113) \n\n\nMost notably, he takes a quote from Dewey about how the existence of\nworks of art has become an obstruction to a theory about them as an\nepigraph to his book. He ends his book by noting that in Dewey\u2019s\nview we are all artists since we are all engaged in making\nexperiences. And yet, \n\n\ntrue artists don\u2019t only make experiences. They make\nobjects\u2026 that afford the opportunity for integral experience.\n(2015: 205)\n\n\nIt is a mark of the endurance and power of Dewey\u2019s aesthetic\ntheory that it has been so frequently criticized and defended from so\nmany different angles. Although many of these criticisms rest on an\nincomplete or distorted understanding of Dewey\u2019s thought, there\nare also many that should be answered by anyone who seeks to carry on\nDewey\u2019s legacy.\n",
