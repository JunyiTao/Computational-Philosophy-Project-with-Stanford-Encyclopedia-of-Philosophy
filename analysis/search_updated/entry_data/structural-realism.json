    "main_text": "\n1. Introduction\n\nScientific realism requires belief in the unobservable entities\nposited by our most successful scientific theories. It is widely held\nthat the most powerful argument in favour of scientific realism is the\nno-miracles argument, according to which the success of science would\nbe miraculous if scientific theories were not at least approximately\ntrue descriptions of the world. While the underdetermination argument\nis often cited as giving grounds for scepticism about theories of\nunobservable entities, arguably the most powerful arguments against\nscientific realism are based on the history of radical theory change\nin science. The best-known of these arguments, although perhaps not\nthe most compelling of them, is the pessimistic meta-induction,\naccording to which reflection on the abandonment of theories in the\nhistory of science supports the expectation that our best current\nscientific theories will themselves be abandoned, and hence that we\nought not to assent to them. (See\n \u00a72\n below and the entry on\n scientific realism\n for more on these arguments.)\n\nStructural realism was introduced into current philosophy of science\nby John Worrall in 1989 as a way to break the impasse that results\nfrom taking both arguments seriously, and have \u201cthe best of both\nworlds\u201d in the debate about scientific realism. With respect to\nthe case of the transition in nineteenth-century optics from\nFresnel\u2019s elastic solid ether theory to Maxwell\u2019s theory\nof the electromagnetic field, Worrall argues that:\n\n\nThere was an important element of continuity in the shift from Fresnel\nto Maxwell\u2014and this was much more than a simple question of\ncarrying over the successful empirical content into the new theory. At\nthe same time it was rather less than a carrying over of the full\ntheoretical content or full theoretical mechanisms (even in\n\u201capproximate\u201d form) \u2026 There was continuity or\naccumulation in the shift, but the continuity is one of form or\nstructure, not of content. (1989: 117)\n\n\nAccording to Worrall, we should not accept standard scientific\nrealism, which asserts that the nature of the unobservable objects\nthat cause the phenomena we observe is correctly described by our best\ntheories. However, neither should we be antirealists about science.\nRather, we should adopt structural realism and epistemically commit\nourselves to the mathematical or structural content of our theories.\nSince there is (says Worrall) retention of structure across theory\nchange, structural realism both (a) avoids the force of the\npessimistic meta-induction (by not committing us to belief in the\ntheory\u2019s description of the furniture of the world) and (b) does\nnot make the success of science (especially the novel predictions of\nmature physical theories) seem miraculous (by committing us to the\nclaim that the theory\u2019s structure, over and above its empirical\ncontent, describes the world).\n\nWorrall\u2019s paper has been widely cited in an extensive literature\nin which various varieties of structural realism are advocated or\ncriticised, and different notions of structure are discussed. These\ncontemporary debates recapitulate the work of some of the greatest\nphilosophers of science of the late nineteenth and early twentieth\ncenturies. The increasing mathematisation of physics through the\nnineteenth century, with electromagnetism and thermodynamics lacking\nmechanical and material models, and then the advent of quantum and\nrelativity physics, prompted a variety of structuralist responses.\nWorrall says he found his structural realism in Henri Poincar\u00e9\n(1902 [1905]; 1905 [1907]) whose structuralism was combined with\nneo-Kantian views about the nature of arithmetic and group theory, and\nwith conventionalism about the geometry of space and time. (The\nprevalence of Kantian themes in the literature on structural realism\nis discussed further below; for more on Poincar\u00e9 and structural\nrealism see Giedymin 1982; Gower 2000; and Zahar 1996, 2001, and\nbelow.) Ernan McMullin (1990) argues that Pierre Duhem was a realist\nabout the relations found in laws but not about explanations in terms\nof an ontology. According to Worrall (1989), Barry Gower (2000) and\nElie Zahar (2001), Duhem too was a kind of structural realist, though\nthere are passages in Duhem that more readily lend themselves to an\ninstrumentalist interpretation (see the entry on\n Pierre Duhem).\n Milena Ivanova (2015a) compares the thought of Duhem and\nPoincar\u00e9 in respect of conventionalism and structural realism,\nidentifying significant differences between their views as well as\nsimilarities. Gower\u2019s (2000) historical survey of structural\nrealism discusses how it figures in the thought of Ernst Cassirer,\nMoritz Schlick, Rudolf Carnap and Bertrand Russell. Stathis Psillos\n(1999) explores the connections between structuralism and the\nRamsey-sentence approach to scientific theory in the development of\nCarnap\u2019s philosophy from logical positivism to ontologically\nrelativist empiricism (Ramsey sentences are discussed in\n \u00a73.2\n below). Other important pioneers of structuralism about science\ninclude Arthur Eddington (see French 2003), Grover Maxwell (see\nLadyman 1998 and\n \u00a73.1\n below) and Hermann Weyl (see Ryckman 2005).\n\nLadyman (1998) distinguished epistemic and ontic forms of structural\nrealism in arguing for the latter. Many of those who have taken up\nstructural realism have been philosophers of physics who have\ndeveloped various forms of ontic structural realism, most notably\nSteven French. Others, including Worrall, have made it clear that\ntheir structural realism is a purely epistemological refinement of\nscientific realism. On the other hand, Bas van Fraassen (1997, 2006,\n2007, 2008) defends an empiricist and non-realist form of\nstructuralism about science, based on his view of scientific\nrepresentation and motivated by an illuminating reconstruction of the\norigins of structuralism in the debate about the epistemology of\nphysical geometry in the nineteenth century (see also Bueno 1999, 2000\non structural empiricism). Other kinds of structuralism abound in\ncurrent analytic philosophy. These include causal structuralism\nconcerning the individuation of properties, mathematical structuralism\nconcerning the nature of mathematical objects, and structuralism about\nlaws and dispositions. Following the debates about structural realism\nin the philosophy of science in the early twentieth century, the\nnotion of structure in general, and the idea of modal structure in\nparticular, have also become prominent in analytic metaphysics.\nClearly, there many different notions of structure, and many different\nkinds of structural realism. This article reviews the main issues and\nprovides a guide for further reading.\n2. The Best of Both Worlds?\n\nScientific realism became dominant in philosophy of science after the\ndemise of the forms of antirealism about science associated with the\nlogical positivists, namely semantic instrumentalism, according to\nwhich theoretical terms are not to be interpreted as referring to\nanything, and theoretical reductionism, according to which theoretical\nterms are disguised ways of referring to observable phenomena. These\nforms of antirealism rely upon discredited positivist ideas about\nscientific language, such as that it can be divided into theoretical\nand observational parts, that much of it should not be taken\nliterally, or that its empirically surplus content is redundant. Bas\nvan Fraassen (1980) revitalised the debate about scientific realism by\nproposing his constructive empiricism as an alternative. His\nantirealism is sceptical rather than dogmatic, and does not depend on\nthe distinction between theoretical and observational terms. He allows\nthat terms such as \u201csub-atomic particle\u201d and\n\u201cparticle too small to see\u201d are perfectly meaningful and\nshould be taken literally (the former term is theoretical and the\nlatter term is not but both purportedly refer to unobservable\nentities). On the other hand, he holds that it is perfectly rational\nto remain agnostic about whether there are any such particles, because\nhe argues that to accept the best scientific theories we have only\nrequires believing that they are empirically adequate, in the sense of\ncorrectly describing the observable world, rather than believing that\nthey are true simpliciter. (For more on constructive empiricism see\nMonton 2007.)\n\nHow then are we to decide whether to believe in the full theoretical\ntruth of scientific theories, including what they say about\nunobservable entities such as electrons and black holes, or whether to\nbelieve instead only that our best scientific theories are empirically\nadequate? Van Fraassen argues that since the latter belief is\nlogically weaker and yet as empirically contentful as the former\nbelief it is natural for an empiricist to go only as far as belief in\nempirical adequacy. On the other hand, many philosophers are moved by\nthe fact that belief in only the empirical adequacy of our best\nscientific theories leaves us unable to explain the phenomena that\nthey describe. Inference to the best explanation is widely believed to\nbe an important form of reasoning in science, and the production of\nexplanations of the world is often supposed to be one of the main\nsuccesses of science. When the target of explanation becomes science\nitself and its history of empirical success as a whole, we arrive at\nthe no-miracles argument famously presented by Hilary Putnam as\nfollows:\n\n\nThe positive argument for realism is that it is the only philosophy\nthat doesn\u2019t make the success of science a miracle. (1975:\n73)\n\n\nThe no-miracles argument is elaborated in terms of specific features\nof scientific methodology and practice. Richard Boyd (1985, for\nexample) argues that in explaining the success of science, we need to\nexplain the overall instrumental success of scientific methods across\nthe history of science. Alan Musgrave (1988) says that the only\nversion of the no-miracles argument that might work is one appealing\nto the novel predictive success of theories. Some realists, such as\nPsillos (1999), have gone so far as to argue that only theories which\nhave enjoyed novel predictive success ought to be considered as\nfalling within the scope of arguments for scientific realism.\n\nColin Howson (2000), P.D. Magnus and Craig Callender (2004), and Peter\nLipton (2004) argue that the no-miracles argument is flawed because in\norder to evaluate the claim that it is probable that theories enjoying\nempirical success are approximately true we have to know what the\nrelevant base rate is, and there is no way we can know this. Magnus\nand Callender argue that \u201cwholesale\u201d arguments that are\nintended to support realism (or antirealism) about science as a whole\n(rather than \u201cretail\u201d arguments that are applied to a\nspecific theory) are only taken seriously because of our propensity to\nengage in the \u201cbase rate fallacy\u201d of evaluating\nprobabilities without knowing all the relevant information. They think\nwe ought to abandon the attempt to defend scientific realism in\ngeneral rather than on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThis assumes that the wholesale arguments against scientific realism\ndo not work. Of these the underdetermination argument, according to\nwhich the existence of empirical equivalents to our best scientific\ntheories implies that we should withhold epistemic commitment to them,\nis is often dismissed by realists as generating doubt about\nunobservables that is no more worrying than doubting other minds or\nthe external world. They argue that since scientists find ways of\nchoosing between empirically equivalent rivals, philosophers ought not\nto make too much of merely in-principle possibilities that are\nirrelevant to scientific practice (see Laudan & Leplin 1991;\nLeplin & Laudan 1993; and Kukla 1998). (Kyle Stanford (2006)\ndefends an underdetermination argument called \u201cthe problem of\nunconceived alternatives\u201d with reference to the history of\nscience, so perhaps not all underdetermination arguments are a\npriori and theoretical.)\n\nThe power of the arguments against scientific realism from theory\nchange is that, rather than being a priori and theoretical,\nthey are empirically based and their premises are based on data\nobtained by examining the practice and history of science. Ontological\ndiscontinuity in theory change seems to give us grounds not for mere\nagnosticism but for the positive belief that many central theoretical\nterms of our best contemporary science will be regarded as\nnon-referring by future science. So-called \u201cpessimistic\nmeta-inductions\u201d about theoretical knowledge take many forms and\nare probably almost as ancient as scepticism itself. They have the\nbasic form:\n\n\nProposition p is widely believed by most contemporary\nexperts, but p is like many other hypotheses that were widely\nbelieved by experts in the past and are disbelieved by most\ncontemporary experts. We have as much reason to expect p to\nbefall their fate as not, therefore we should at least suspend\njudgement about p if not actively disbelieve it.\n\n\nMore precisely, Larry Laudan (1981) gave a very influential argument\nwith the following structure:\n\nThere have been many empirically successful theories\nin the history of science which have subsequently been rejected and\nwhose theoretical terms do not refer according to our best current\ntheories.\nOur best current theories are no different in kind\nfrom those discarded theories and so we have no reason to think they\nwill not ultimately be replaced as well.\n\n\nSo, by induction we have positive reason to expect that our best\ncurrent theories will be replaced by new theories according to which\nsome of the central theoretical terms of our best current theories do\nnot refer, and hence we should not believe in the approximate truth or\nthe successful reference of the theoretical terms of our best current\ntheories.\n\nThe most common realist response to this argument is to restrict\nrealism to theories with some further properties (usually, maturity,\nand novel predictive success) so as to cut down the inductive base\nemployed in\n (i)\n (see Psillos 1996). Moreover Peter Lewis (2001), Marc Lange (2002)\nand Magnus and Callender (2004) regard the pessimistic meta-induction\nas a fallacy of probabilistic reasoning. However, there are arguments\nfrom theory change that are not probabilistic. Note first that there\nare several cases of mature theories which enjoyed novel predictive\nsuccess, notably the ether theory of light and the caloric theory of\nheat. If their central theoretical terms do not refer, the\nrealist\u2019s claim that approximate truth explains empirical\nsuccess will no longer be enough to establish realism, because we will\nneed some other explanation for the success of the caloric and ether\ntheories. If this will do for these theories then it ought to do for\nothers where we happened to have retained the central theoretical\nterms, and then we do not need the realist\u2019s preferred\nexplanation that such theories are true and successfully refer to\nunobservable entities.\n\nLaudan\u2019s paper was also intended to show that the successful\nreference of its theoretical terms is not a necessary condition for\nthe novel predictive success of a theory (1981: 45), and there are\ncounter-examples to the no-miracles argument.\n\nSuccessful reference of its central theoretical terms is a\nnecessary condition for the approximate truth of a theory.\nThere are examples of theories that were mature and had novel\npredictive success but whose central theoretical terms do not\nrefer.\nSo there are examples of theories that were mature and had novel\npredictive success but which are not approximately true.\nApproximate truth and successful reference of central theoretical\nterms is not a necessary condition for the novel-predictive success of\nscientific theories\n\n\n\nSo, the no-miracles argument is undermined since, if approximate truth\nand successful reference are not available to be part of the\nexplanation of some theories\u2019 novel predictive success, there is\nno reason to think that the novel predictive success of other theories\nhas to be explained by realism.\n\n\nThere are two common (not necessarily exclusive) responses to\nthis:\n\n\n\nDevelop an account of reference according to which the abandoned\ntheoretical terms are regarded as successfully referring after\nall.\n\nRealists developed causal theories of reference to account for\ncontinuity of reference for terms like \u201catom\u201d or\n\u201celectron\u201d, even though the theories about atoms and\nelectrons have undergone significant changes. The difference with the\nterms \u201cether\u201d and \u201ccaloric\u201d is that they are\nno longer used in modern science. However, as C.L. Hardin and\nAlexander Rosenberg (1982) argue, the causal theory of reference may\nbe used to defend the claim that terms like \u201cether\u201d\nreferred to whatever causes the phenomena responsible for the\nterms\u2019 introduction. This is criticized by Laudan (1984) as\nmaking the reference of theoretical terms a trivial matter, since as\nlong as some phenomena prompt the introduction of a term it will\nautomatically successfully refer to whatever is the relevant cause (or\ncauses). Furthermore, this theory radically disconnects what a\ntheorist is talking about from what she thinks she is talking about.\nFor example, Aristotle or Newton could be said to be referring to\ngeodesic motion in a curved spacetime when, respectively, they talked\nabout the natural motion of material objects, and the fall of a body\nunder the effect of the gravitational force. \n\n\nRestrict realism to those parts of theories that play an essential\nrole in the derivation of subsequently observed (novel) predictions,\nand then argue that the terms of past theories which are now regarded\nas non-referring were non-essential and hence that there is no reason\nto deny that the essential terms in current theories will be retained.\nPhilip Kitcher says that: \u201c[n]o sensible realist should ever\nwant to assert that the idle parts of an individual practice, past or\npresent, are justified by the success of the whole\u201d (1993:\n142). \n\n\nThe most detailed and influential response to the argument from theory\nchange is due to Psillos (1999), who combines strategies\n (I)\n and\n (II).\n Hasok Chang (2003), Kyle Stanford (2003a,b), Mohammed Elsamahi\n(2005), and Timothy Lyons (2006) criticize Psillos\u2019s account.\nOther responses include Kitcher\u2019s (1993) model of reference\naccording to which some tokens of theoretical terms refer and others\ndo not. Christina McLeish (2005) criticizes Kitcher\u2019s theory by\narguing that there are no satisfactory grounds for making the\ndistinction between referring and non-referring tokens. McLeish (2006)\nargues that abandoned theoretical terms like \u201cether\u201d\npartially refer and partially fail to refer. Juha Saatsi (2005) denies\npremise (a) and claims that there can be approximate truth of the\ncausal roles postulated by a scientific theory without its central\nterms necessarily successfully referring (see also Chakravartty 1998).\nThere is no consensus among those defending standard realism in the\nface of theory change by adopting the selective approach of (II) with\nan account of reference.\n\nConsider again the much-discussed case of the ether. Psillos argues\nthat Fresnel\u2019s use of the term \u201cether\u201d was essential\nto his successful theorising, but that it referred to the\nelectromagnetic field. Worrall (1989) argues that the project of\ndefending realism by securing reference for abandoned theoretical\nterms is missing the point of the problem as well as the key to its\nsolution. It is plausible to take \u201cfield\u201d to be a new way\nof referring to what the ancients and early moderns termed\n\u201caether\u201d or \u201cether\u201d. Fields like the ether\npermeate all of space and are posited to explain optical, magnetic and\nother phenomena. Anaxagoras is said to have introduced the idea of the\nether to propel the planets, and subsequently there were many ethers\nto account for various things. Fresnel\u2019s optical ether was\nsupposed to be a solid and Maxwell\u2019s field behaves very\ndifferently and is said to be immaterial. However, from our current\nperspective the ether has much more in common with the field, than\natoms do with the indivisible particles of antiquity (Stein 1989), and\nso continuity of reference is not the issue. The reference of the term\n\u201cenergy\u201d at least overlaps in classical and quantum\ntheories because quantities in each coincide in the limit as the\nnumber of particles increases. This does not solve the problem that\nthe radical ontological and metaphysical differences between the\ntheories pose for the realist. Different theories often use the same\nterms, to say very different things about what the world is like. The\nquestion of which terms refer, does not settle the whether it is\nplausible to say that the metaphysics and ontology of the theory is\neven approximately true, because in many case the same theoretical\nterm is still used despite radical changes.\n\nThe argument from theory change threatens scientific realism because\nif what science now says is correct, then the ontologies of past\nscientific theories are far from accurate accounts of the furniture of\nthe world. If that is so even though they were predictively\nsuccessful, then the success of our best current theories does not\nmean they have got the nature of the world right either. The task of\nproviding an adequate theory of approximate truth that fits the\nhistory of science and directly addresses the problem of ontological\ncontinuity has hitherto defeated realists, but a much more tractable\nproblem is to display the structural commonalities between different\ntheories. Hence, a form of realism about the structure of theories\nmight not be undermined by theory change. Gerhard Schurz (2009) proves\na structural correspondence theorem showing that successive theories\nthat share empirical content also share theoretical content.\n\nThe structuralist solution to this problem is to take the metaphysical\nimport of successful scientific theories to consist in their giving\ncorrect descriptions of the structure of the world, where this\nstructure can be captured with different ontologies. Theories can be\nso different as to be contrary to each other, while both represent the\nsame structure in the phenomena. Consider the theory according to\nwhich combustion is the emission of phlogiston that was dominant in\nchemistry prior to the end of the eighteenth century. Despite their\nradical disagreement about the nature of combustion both phlogiston\ntheory, and the oxygen theory of Lavoisier that succeeded it, regard\ncombustion, respiration and the calcination of metals as the same kind\nof process, and reciprocal to another kind of process exemplified by\nthe smelting of ore. Furthermore there are tables of affinity that\nwere formulated by the phlogistonists that can be reinterpreted in\nterms of Lavoisian chemistry (see Schurz 2009 and Ladyman 2011).\nHence, even in this case there is continuity of structure despite the\ncentral entity of the old theory not existing at all according to the\nnew theory\n\nThere are numerous examples of continuity in the mathematical\nstructure of successive scientific theories. Indeed the principle that\nold ones should be recovered from new ones in some limit was\nexplicitly formulated by Niels Bohr as the methodological principle\nknown as the \u201ccorrespondence principle\u201d, according to\nwhich quantum-mechanical models ought to mathematically reduce to\nclassical models in the limit of large numbers of particles, or in the\nlimit of Planck\u2019s constant becoming arbitrarily small relative\nto the action of the system. There are many cases in quantum mechanics\nwhere the Hamiltonian functions that represent the total energy of\nmechanical systems imitate those of classical mechanics, but with\nvariables like those that stand for position and momentum replaced by\nHermitian operators. There is a now a large literature in philosophy\nof physics that considers different characterisations of the structure\nof theories, and how it relates to to the relations between them, and\ntheir empirical content. Simon Saunders (1993a) discusses the\nstructural continuities between classical and quantum mechanics and\nalso shows how much structure Ptolemaic and Copernican astronomy have\nin common. Harvey Brown (1993) explains the correspondence between\nSpecial Relativity and classical mechanics. Jonathan Bain and John\nNorton (2001) discuss the structural continuity in descriptions of the\nelectron, as does Angelo Cei (2005). Votsis (2011) considers examples\nof continuity and discontinuity in physics. Robert Batterman (2002)\ndiscusses many examples of limiting relationships between theories,\nnotably the renormalization group approach to critical phenomena, and\nthe relationship between wave and ray optics. Holger Lyre (2004)\nextends Worrall\u2019s original example of the continuity between\nwave optics and electromagnetism by considering the relationship\nbetween Maxwellian electrodynamics and Quantum Electrodynamics. Alisa\nBokulich (2008) considers the quantum-classical transition in detail\narguing for what she calls \u201cinterstructuralism\u201d as an\napproach to intertheory relations that emphasises structural\ncontinuities and correspondences. Zenker and G\u00e4rdenfors (2015)\nadopt a conceptual spaces approach to the continuity of theory\nstructure. Joshua Rosaler (2015) analyses intertheory relations in\nphysics arguing that local relations between models in different\ndomains must be considered as well as global relations between\ntheories. Manero (2022) argues for the stability of Lie algebras over\ntheory change in physics.\n\nThe most minimal form of structuralism focuses on empirical structure,\nand as such is best thought of as a defence of the cumulative nature\nof science in the face of Kuhnian worries about revolutions (following\nPost 1971). See Katherine Brading\u2019s and Elaine Landry\u2019s\n(2006) \u201cminimal structuralism\u201d, and Otavio Bueno\u2019s\n(1999, 2000) and van Fraassen\u2019s (2006, 2007, 2008) structural\nempiricism (Ryckman 2005 calls the latter \u201cinstrumental\nstructuralism\u201d). For a range of recent work on the problem of\ntheory change see Lyons & Vickers (eds.) 2021.\n3. Epistemic Structural Realism (ESR)\n\nStructural realism is often characterised as the view that scientific\ntheories tell us only about the form or structure of the unobservable\nworld and not about its nature. This leaves open the question of\nwhether the natures of things are posited to be unknowable for some\nreason or eliminated altogether. Hence, Ladyman (1998) considers\nwhether Worrall\u2019s structural realism should be understood as a\nmetaphysical or epistemological modification of standard scientific\nrealism. Worrall\u2019s paper is ambiguous in this respect. That he\nhas in mind only an epistemic constraint on realism\u2014commitment\nto the structure of our best scientific theories but agnosticism about\nthe rest of the content\u2014is suggested by his citation of\nPoincar\u00e9 who talks of the redundant theories of the past\ncapturing the \u201ctrue relations\u201d between the \u201creal\nobjects which Nature will hide forever from our eyes\u201d (1905\n[1907: 162]). So one way of thinking about structural realism is as an\nepistemological modification of scientific realism to the effect that\nwe only believe what scientific theories tell us about the relations\nentered into by unobservable objects, and suspend judgement as to the\nnature of the latter. (ESR is called \u201crestrictive structural\nrealism\u201d by Psillos 2001.) There are various forms this might\ntake. (See French & Ladyman 2011.)\n\nWe cannot know the individuals that instantiate the\nstructure of the world but we can know their properties and\nrelations.\nWe cannot know the individuals or their\nintrinsic/non-relational properties but we can know their first-order\nrelational properties.\nWe cannot know the individuals, their first-order\nproperties or relations, but we can know the second-order structure of\ntheir relational properties. Russell (1927) and Carnap (1928) took\nthis extreme view and argued that science only tells us about purely\nlogical features of the world.\n\n\nPsillos (2001) refers to the \u201cupward path\u201d to structural\nrealism as beginning with empiricist epistemological principles and\narriving at structural knowledge of the external world. The\n\u201cdownward\u201d path is to arrive at structural realism by\nweakening standard scientific realism as suggested by Worrall. Both\npaths are criticized by Psillos. Russell (1927) was led along the\nupward path by three epistemological principles: firstly, the claim\nthat we only have direct access to our percepts (Ayer\u2019s\n\u201cegocentric predicament\u201d); secondly, the principle that\ndifferent effects have different causes (which is called the\nHelmholtz-Weyl Principle by Psillos); and thirdly, that the relations\nbetween percepts have the same logico-mathematical structure as the\nrelations between their causes. This led him to the claim that science\ncan only describe the world up to isomorphism, and hence to\n (3)\n above since according to him we know only the (second-order)\nisomorphism class of the structure of the world and not the\n(first-order) structure itself. Russell\u2019s upward path is\ndefended by Votsis (2005). Beni (2017a) considers the upward path in\nthe light of the science of perception. Katherine Brading and Elise\nCrull (2017) explore the link between Poincar\u00e9\u2019s\nphilosophy of science and ESR, as does Ivanova (2015b) focusing on the\nconnection with conventionalism and neo-Kantianism. Beni (2018) takes\nthe downward path to ESR using information-theory.\n\nMost defenders of ESR assume that there must be individual objects and\nproperties that are ontologically prior to relational structure.\nMatteo Morganti (2004) differs from other epistemic structural\nrealists by arguing for agnosticism about whether there is a domain of\nindividuals over and above relational structure. Mauro Dorato argues\nfor ESR on the grounds that structural realism needs entity realism to\nbe plausible (2000) (but perhaps ontic structural realism can also be\nreconciled with entity realism to some extent (see below)).\n3.1 Kantian ESR\n\nAs mentioned above, Poincar\u00e9\u2019s structuralism had a\nKantian flavour. In particular, he thought that the unobservable\nentities postulated by scientific theories were Kant\u2019s noumena\nor things in themselves. He revised Kant\u2019s view by arguing that\nthe latter can be known indirectly rather than not at all because it\nis possible to know the relations into which they enter.\nPoincar\u00e9 followed the upward path to structural realism,\nbeginning with the neo-Kantian goal of recovering the objective or\nintersubjective world from the subjective world of private sense\nimpressions:\n\n\nwhat we call objective reality is\u2026 what is common to many\nthinking beings and could be common to all; \u2026 the harmony of\nmathematical laws. (1905 [1907: 14])\n\n\nHowever, he also followed the downward path to structural realism\narguing that the history of science can be seen as cumulative at the\nlevel of relations rather than objects. For example, between\nCarnot\u2019s and Clausius\u2019 thermodynamics the ontology changes\nbut the Second Law of Thermodynamics is preserved. While Worrall never\ndirectly endorses the Kantian aspect of Poincar\u00e9\u2019s\nthought, Zahar\u2019s structural realism is explicitly a form of\nKantian transcendental idealism according to which science can never\ntell us more than the structure of the noumenal world; the nature of\nthe entities and properties of which it consists are epistemically\ninaccessible to us (as in\n (2)\n above). Ivanova 2013 considers how Perrin\u2019s experiments\nconverted Poincar\u00e9 to atomism despite his previous opposition\nto it, but did not lead him to abandon his neo-Kantianism. Michela\nMassimi (2011) develops a different neo-Kantian perspective on\nstructural realism.\n\nFrank Jackson (1998), Rae Langton (1998), and David Lewis (2009) also\nadvocate views similar to ESR. Jackson refers to \u201cKantian\nphysicalism\u201d (1998: 23\u201324), Langton to \u201cKantian\nHumility\u201d, and Lewis to \u201cRamseyan Humility\u201d. Peter\nUnger (1979) also argues that our knowledge of the world is purely\nstructural and that qualia are the non-structural components of\nreality. Jackson argues that science only reveals the\ncausal/relational properties of physical objects, and that\n\n\nwe know next to nothing about the intrinsic nature of the world. We\nknow only its causal cum relational nature. (1998: 24)\n\n\nLangton argues that science only reveals the extrinsic properties of\nphysical objects, and both then argue that their intrinsic natures,\nand hence the intrinsic nature of the world, are epistemically\ninaccessible. Jackson points out that this inference can be blocked if\nthe natures of objects and their intrinsic properties are identified\nwith their relational or extrinsic properties, but argues that this\nmakes a mystery of what it is that stands in the causal relations.\nLewis\u2019 structuralism is based on the centrality he gives to the\nRamsey sentence reconstruction of scientific theories that is the\nsubject of the next section.\n3.2 ESR and Ramsey Sentences\n\nA position called structural realism, that amounts to an\nepistemological gloss on traditional scientific realism, was advocated\nby Grover Maxwell (1962, 1968 [1972], 1970a, 1970b). Maxwell wanted to\nmake scientific realism compatible with \u201cconcept\nempiricism\u201d about the meaning of theoretical terms, and he also\nwanted to explain how we can have epistemic access to unobservable\nentities. The problem as Maxwell saw it was that theories talk about\nall sorts of entities and processes with which we are not\n\u201cacquainted\u201d. How, he wondered, can we then know about and\nrefer to them and their properties? The answer that he gave, following\nRussell, was that we can know about them by description, that is we\ncan know them via their structural properties. In fact, he argues,\nthis is the limit of our knowledge of them, and the meanings of\ntheoretical terms are to be understood purely structurally. The way\nthat Maxwell explicates the idea that the structure of the theory\nexhausts the cognitive content of its theoretical terms, is to\nconsider the Ramsey sentence of the theory (Ramsey [1929] 1931).\nRamsey\u2019s method allows the elimination of theoretical terms from\na theory by replacing them with existentially quantified predicate\nvariables (or names in the case of the influential D. Lewis 1970). If\none replaces the conjunction of assertions of a first-order theory\nwith its Ramsey sentence, the observational consequences of the theory\nare carried over, but direct reference to unobservables is\neliminated.\n\nIf we formalise a theory in a first-order language: \n\\[\\Pi(O_1,\\ldots,O_n; T_1,\\ldots,T_m),\\]\n\n\nwhere the Os are the observational terms and the Ts\nare the theoretical terms, then the corresponding Ramsey sentence\nis \n\\[\\exists t_1,\\ldots,t_m \\Pi(O_1,\\ldots,O_n;t_1,\\ldots,t_m).\\]\n\n\nThus the Ramsey sentence only asserts that there are some objects,\nproperties and relations that have certain logical features,\nsatisfying certain implicit definitions. It is a higher-order\ndescription, but ultimately connects the theoretical content of the\ntheory with observable behaviour. However, it is a mistake to think\nthat the Ramsey sentence allows us to eliminate theoretical entities,\nfor it still states that these exist. It is just that they are\nreferred to not directly, by means of theoretical terms, but by\ndescription, that is via variables, connectives, quantifiers and\npredicate terms whose direct referents are (allegedly) known by\nacquaintance. Thus Maxwell (and Russell) claimed that knowledge of the\nunobservable realm is limited to knowledge of its structural rather\nthan intrinsic properties, or, as is sometimes said, limited to\nknowledge of its higher-order properties. It is arguable that this is\nthe purest structuralism possible, for the notion of structure\nemployed refers to the higher-order properties of a theory, those that\nare only expressible in purely formal terms.\n\nThis is an epistemological structural realism meant to vindicate and\nnot to revise the ontological commitments of scientific realism. On\nthis view the objective world is composed of unobservable objects\nbetween which certain properties and relations obtain; but we can only\nknow the properties and relations of these properties and relations,\nthat is, the structure of the objective world. However, there are\nserious difficulties with this view which were originally raised by M.\nH. A. Newman in 1928 and which have been recently discussed by\nDemopoulos and Friedman (1985 [1989]). The basic problem is that\nstructure is not sufficient to uniquely pick out any relations in the\nworld. Suppose that the world consists of a set of objects whose\nstructure is W with respect to some relation R,\nabout which nothing else is known. Any collection of things can be\nregarded as having structure W provided there is the right\nnumber of them. This is because according to the extensional\ncharacterisation of relations defined on a domain of individuals,\nevery relation is identified with some set of subsets of the domain.\nThe power set axiom entails the existence of every such subset and\nhence every such relation.\n\nAs Demopoulos and Friedman point out, if \u220f is consistent, and if\nall its purely observational consequences are true, then the truth of\nthe corresponding Ramsey sentence follows as a theorem of second-order\nlogic or set theory (provided the initial domain has the right\ncardinality\u2014and if it does not then consistency implies that\nthere exists one that does). The formal structure of a relation can\neasily be obtained with any collection of objects provided there are\nenough of them, so having the formal structure cannot single out a\nunique referent for this relation; in order to do so we must stipulate\nthat we are talking about the intended relation, which is to go beyond\nthe structural description. \u201cThus on this view, only cardinality\nquestions are open to discovery!\u201d (1985: 627 [1989: 188]);\neverything else will be known a priori.\n\nThis leads Demopoulos and Friedman to conclude that reducing a theory\nto its Ramsey sentence is equivalent to reducing it to its empirical\nconsequences, and thus that:\n\n\nRussell\u2019s realism collapses into a version of phenomenalism or\nstrict empiricism after all: all theories with the same observational\nconsequences will be equally true. (1985: 635 [1989: 195])\n\n\nSimilarly, Jane English (1973) argued, though on the basis of\ndifferent considerations, that any two Ramsey sentences that are\nincompatible with one another cannot have all their observational\nconsequences in common. Hence it seems that if we treat a theory just\nas its Ramsey sentence then the notion of theoretical equivalence\ncollapses onto that of empirical equivalence. (Demopoulos 2003 argues\nthat similar considerations show that structural empiricism also\ncollapses truth to empirical adequacy; he also discusses the\nrelationship between Newman\u2019s problem and Putnam\u2019s\nParadox. Votsis (2003) argues that the conclusion of the Newman\nargument doesn\u2019t undermine ESR after all. Gordon Solomon (1989)\ndefends Richard Braithwaite\u2019s claim that Eddington\u2019s\nstructuralism (see\n \u00a74.1\n below) is vulnerable to Newman\u2019s argument.)\n\nJeffery Ketland (2004) argues in detail that the Newman objection\ntrivialises the Ramsey sentence formulation of ESR. Worrall and Zahar\n(2001) argue that the cognitive content of a theory is exhausted by\nits Ramsey sentences but that, while the Ramsey sentence only\nexpresses the empirical content of the theory, the notion of empirical\ncontent in play here is sufficient for a form of realism. In his 2007\npaper, Worrall sets out an account and defense of epistemic structural\nrealism and responds to objections that have been raised to it,\nincluding the Newman problem. Cruse (2005) and Melia and Saatsi (2006)\ndefend the Ramsey sentence approach against model-theoretic arguments\nby questioning the assumption that all predicates which apply to\nunobservables must be eliminated in favour of bound variables. Mixed\npredicates such as \u201cextended\u201d are those that apply to both\nobservable and unobservable objects. The Newman objection does not go\nthrough if mixed predicates are not Ramsified, because a model of the\nRamsey sentence will not necessarily be one in which what is claimed\nregarding the mixed properties and relations holds. In response,\nDemopoulos (2011) points out that the Ramsey sentence of a theory with\nmixed predicates where the latter are not Ramsified will be true\nprovided the original theory is satisfied\u2014hence the claim that\nthe content of the Ramsey sentence is merely the observational content\nof the original theory plus a cardinality claim is still true when\nmixed predicates are considered. Melia and Saatsi (2006) also argue\nthat intensional notions, such as naturalness and causal significance,\nmay be applied to properties to save the Ramsey sentence formulation\nof ESR from triviality. (This recalls the defence of Russell\u2019s\nstructuralism against Newman discussed in Hochberg 1994.) Demopoulos\nalso raises two problems with this strategy: firstly, even non-natural\nrelations can have significant claims made about them in a theory, and\nsecondly, the cognitive significance of unramsified theories is\nindependent of a commitment to \u201creal\u201d or\n\u201cnatural\u201d relations. Hence, Demopoulos insists that the\nRamsey sentence of a theory and the theory itself are importantly\ndifferent (see also Psillos 2006b). Peter Ainsworth (2009) gives an\naccessible account of the Newman problem and the responses that have\nbeen given to it. Ladyman (1998) and Ladyman and Ross (2007) argue\nthat the Newman problem does not arise for ontic structural realism\nbecause it eschews an extensional understanding of relations.\n\nIn his 2011 paper, Demopoulos argues that there are three very\ndifferent views in the work of Russell, Ramsey, and Carnap\nrespectively, which have in common versions of a core structuralist\nthesis that he identifies. All the accounts he considers make use of\nRamsey sentences; Demopoulos investigates the logical properties of\nthe Ramsey sentence and arrives at an argument against the\nstructuralist thesis. Friedman (2011) argues that Carnap\u2019s\naccount of theoretical terms involving the Ramsey sentence approach is\nnot vulnerable to the Newman problem. The relationship between\nFriedman\u2019s views on the relativized a priori and\nstructural realism is interrogated in Ivanova (2011).\n\nStructural realism is supposed to help with the problem of theory\nchange. As Maxwell himself pointed out, his structural realism is a\npurely semantic and epistemological theory. The Ramsey sentence picks\nout exactly the same entities as the original theory. It does not\ndispense with reference, but it makes that reference a function of the\n(place of the theoretical terms in the) overall structure of the\ntheory, as manifested in the Ramsey sentence. Hence, Ladyman (1998)\nargues that in general epistemological forms of structural realism do\nnot significantly improve the prospects of standard scientific realism\nand that structural realism should be thought of as metaphysically\nrather than merely epistemically revisionary. The problem of\nontological discontinuity is arguably left untouched by simply\nadopting Ramsification. In fact, it seems even worse if contextualism\nabout the meaning of theoretical terms is adopted. Cei and French\n(2006) and Cruse (2005) also argue, on different grounds, that\nRamsification is of no help to the structural realist.\n\nVersions of ESR that employ the Ramsey sentence of a theory and the\ndistinction between observational and theoretical terms are embedded\nin the so-called \u201csyntactic\u201d view of theories that adopts\nfirst-order quantificational logic as the appropriate form for the\nrepresentation of physical theories. According to Zahar (1996: 14) the\ncontinuity in science is in the intension rather than the extension of\nits concepts. He argues that if we believe that the mathematical\nstructure of theories is fundamentally important for ontology, then we\nneed a semantics for theories that addresses the representative role\nof mathematics directly. Such an account of scientific representation\nis allegedly found in the so-called \u201csemantic\u201d or\n\u201cmodel-theoretic\u201d approach associated primarily with\nPatrick Suppes, Fred Suppe, Ron Giere and Bas van Fraassen, and more\nrecently da Costa and French (2003). The relationship between\nstructuralism and the semantic view is discussed by van Fraassen\n(1997, 2008), and Thomson-Jones (2011). Chris Pincock (2011)\ncriticises structural realism on the basis of an analysis of the role\nof mathematics in scientific representation. See also Beni (2019) for\nthe development of a form of structural realism together with an\naccount of representation in general. Wallace (2022) argues that the\nmathematics-first view of scientific representation of the semantic\nview leads naturally to ontic structural realism.\n4. Ontic Structural Realism (OSR)\n\nWorrall\u2019s statement of structural realism in his 1989 paper is\nnot explicitly epistemic, and some of his remarks prompt a different\ninterpretation:\n\n\nOn the structural realist view what Newton really discovered are the\nrelationships between phenomena expressed in the mathematical\nequations of his theory. (1989: 122)\n\n\nSome philosophers of physics had already more explicitly signalled a\nsignificant departure from traditional realist metaphysics. For\nexample, Howard Stein says:\n\n\n[O]ur science comes closest to comprehending \u201cthe real\u201d,\nnot in its account of \u201csubstances\u201d and their kinds, but in\nits account of the \u201cForms\u201d which phenomena\n\u201cimitate\u201d (for \u201cForms\u201d read \u201ctheoretical\nstructures\u201d, for \u201cimitate\u201d, \u201care represented\nby\u201d). (1989: 57)\n\n\nMichael Redhead (1999: 34) says: \u201cthe best candidate for what is\n\u2018true\u2019 about a physical theory is the abstract structural\naspect\u201d. Accordingly, Ladyman (1998) argues that structural\nrealism ought to be developed as a metaphysical position according to\nwhich, since the continuity in scientific change is of \u201cform or\nstructure\u201d, the success of science should be accounted for in\nterms of the representation of modal relations among phenomena, not in\nterms of continuity of reference to objects and properties. Giere\n(1985) first suggested that a form of structural realism results from\nconjoining modal realism with constructive empiricism to form a modal\nempiricism. The idea of modal structure is central to OSR in the work\nof French, Ladyman, Ross and others, and is an abstraction of causal\nstructure and nomological structure, that is intended to also include\nsymmetry principles and perhaps more (the structure of dispositions\ndescribed by Mumford (2004) and Psillos\u2019s (2002) idea of\nnomological structure are more restrictive ideas of modal structure).\nThe reason why it is claimed that some modal structure is retained on\ntheory change, as well as the approximate truth of empirical\nregularities, is that counterfactuals, explanations and predictions\nare retained in a limited domain or regime when an old theory is\nsuperseded. For example, the reason the same side of the Moon always\nfaces the Earth was explained by Newton in the third book of the\nPrincipia in terms of a gravitational tidal lock, and this explanation\nand related counterfactuals and predictions are retained in current\nphysics even though Newtonian gravitation has been superseded by\nGeneral Relativity. Nora Berenstain and Ladyman (2012) argue that a\ncommitment to natural necessity is implicit in arguments for\nscientific realism, and that all scientific realists should be\nrealists about modal structure as a form of natural necessity, and so\nshould reject Humean supervenience. However, Esfeld (2009) develops a\nHumean take on structural realism, as does Lyre (2010). Ruyant (2019)\nconsiders how to understand continuity of modal structure in the\nhistory of science in terms of a modalised Ramsey sentence which he\nargues supports modal empiricism as distinct from structural\nrealism.\n\nOSR has attracted most sympathy among some philosophers of physics and\nphysicists. This is natural since, while Worrall\u2019s motivation\nfor introducing structural realism was solely the need for a realist\nresponse to the pessimistic meta-induction, the proposal of OSR in\nLadyman (1998) and its development in French and Ladyman (2003a,b) and\ntheir subsequent work was also motivated by two other problems:\n\nidentity and individuality of quantum particles and\nspacetime points, and entanglement;\nscientific representation, in particular the role of\nmodels and idealisations in physics.\n\n\nTheir concern with\n (a)\n followed that of many of the pioneers of structuralism in\ntwentieth-century philosophy of science including Cassirer, Eddington\nand Weyl. (Russell\u2019s and Carnap\u2019s versions of\nstructuralism were more directly motivated by epistemological and\nsemantic problems than by ontological issues arising from physics.)\nFrench did seminal work on the identity and individuality of quantum\nparticles with Michael Redhead (French & Redhead 1988). In\nrelation to\n (b),\n Redhead also wrote a classic paper on theories and models (1980), and\nFrench and Ladyman (1999) defended and developed the model-theoretic\napproach to scientific theories; Ladyman and Ross (2007), Gordon\nMcCabe (2007), French (2014) and Wallace (2022) all defend OSR\nas a view that takes account of the ineliminability of mathematics in\nhow physics represents.\n\nOSR may be advocated as a response to current physics as a whole (for\nexample, see Tegmark 2008), or in part (see below). Karim\nTh\u00e9bault (2016) considers quantisation in order to formulate\nOSR. Dorato and Morganti (2022) consider structural realism as an\nontology for Rovelli\u2019s Relational Quantum Mechanics. Saunders\nand David Wallace have deployed structuralism to solve the problem of\nhow macroscopic objects with more or less determinate properties can\nbe recovered from the Everett interpretation of quantum states (the\nso-called preferred basis problem) (Saunders 1993b, 1995, and Wallace\n2003). Saeed Masoumi (2021b) defends OSR by considering how to break\nthe underdetermination of different forms of Newtonian physics.\n(Different versions of OSR are also elaborated and defended against\nvarious criticisms in Ladyman and Ross (2007), French and Ladyman\n(2011), Ladyman (2011), French (2014) and further sources cited\nbelow.)\n\nOntic structural realists argue that current physics teaches us that\nthe nature of space, time and matter are not compatible with standard\nmetaphysical views about the ontological relationship between\nindividuals, intrinsic properties and relations. On the broadest\nconstrual OSR is any form of structural realism incorporating an\nontological or metaphysical thesis that inflates the ontological\npriority of structure and relations. The attempt to make this precise\nsplinters OSR into different forms (three of these are discussed in\nAinsworth (2010) and he argues against two of them), and all of the\nfollowing claims have been advocated by some defenders of OSR at some\ntime (and some of them overlap, or differ largely or solely only in\nemphasis).\n\n(1)\nEliminativism: there are no individuals (but there is relational\nstructure).\n\n\nA crude statement of ESR is the claim that all we know is the\nstructure of the relations between things and not the things\nthemselves, and a corresponding crude statement of OSR is the claim\nthat there are no \u201cthings\u201d and that structure is all there\nis, and in particular there are no individual things. This is called\nand \u201celiminative structural realism\u201d by Psillos (2001) who\nobjects to the elimination of objects from ontology, and\n\u201cradical structuralism\u201d by van Fraassen (2006), who argues\nit collapses the distinction between abstract and concrete structure\nand between pure mathematics and physics. For a recent defence of an\nexplicitly eliminativist version of OSR see French (2010, 2016,\n2019a). For a form of eliminativism about individuals in metaphysics\ndeveloped without reference to structural realism see Dasgupta\n(2009).\n\nEliminativism is criticised on the grounds that there cannot be\nrelations without relata. This objection has been made by various\nphilosophers including Cao (2003b), Dorato (2000), Psillos (2001,\n2006a), Busch (2003), Morganti (2004) and Chakravartty (1998, 2003)\nwho says:\n\n\none cannot intelligibly subscribe to the reality of relations unless\none is also committed to the fact that some things are related. (1998:\n399)\n\n\nThe idea is that structure requires individuals, since structure is\nrelations, and relations require relata which are individuals. Even\nmany of those sympathetic to OSR object that it amounts to crediting\nrelations without relata (Esfeld & Lam 2008; Lyre 2004; Stachel\n2006; and Yaghmaie 2021).\n\nHowever, there are at least two ways to make sense of the idea of\nrelations without relata:\n\n\n\nThe idea of a universal. For example, when we refer to the relation\nreferred to by \u201clarger than\u201d, it is because we have an\ninterest in its formal properties that are independent of the\ncontingencies of its instantiation. To say that all that there is are\nrelations and no relata, is perhaps to follow Plato and say that the\nworld of appearances is not properly thought of as part of the content\nof knowledge. (See Esfeld & Lam 2008: 5, and the opening epigram\nin Psillos 2006a) This Platonic version of OSR is perhaps what Howard\nStein has in mind:\n\n\n\u2026 if one examines carefully how phenomena are\n\u201crepresented\u201d by the quantum theory\u2026 then\u2026\ninterpretation in terms of \u201centities\u201d and\n\u201cattributes\u201d can be seen to be highly dubious\u2026 I\nthink the live problems concern the relation of the Forms \u2026 to\nphenomena, rather than the relation of (putative) attributes to\n(putative) entities \u2026. (Stein 1989: 59)\n \n\n\nThe relata of a given relation always turn out to be relational\nstructures themselves on further analysis. As Stachel puts it,\n\u201cit\u2019s relations all the way down\u201d (although he\ndenies the claim, 2006). See Saunders (2003d: 129) and Ladyman and\nRoss (2007) for the idea that there may be no fundamental relata, and\nhence that it is relational structure all the way down. The idea that\nthere may be no fundamental level to reality is discussed in Schaffer\n(2003). Much discussion of OSR in ever form relates to issues of\nfundamentality and the relative ontological priority of objects,\nproperties and relations. Horgan and Potrc (2000) take the fundamental\nlevel to be the whole universe so that there are not really any\nrelations because there is only one thing. Schaffer 2010 argues that\nthere are no external relations, in the sense that all relations are\ninternal to the one thing that is everything. Other metaphysicians who\ndoubt, deny or downgrade relations include John Heil, E.J.Lowe and\nPeter Simons (see Marmodoro & Yates 2016). \n\n\nAnother response to the relations without relata objection is to argue\nthat OSR does not require that there be no relata, just that the\nrelata not be individuals. However, there is no unanimity about the\ndifference between individuals, objects, and entities among\nphilosophers. One way of putting the issue is to ask whether all\nobjects are individuals, or whether individuals are objects satisfying\nsome additional criteria (for example, having identity over time or\ntransworld identity, see Ladyman 2016). Clearly, debates about OSR are\nnot productive unless the terminology is univocal, and the\nphilosophical logic of individuals, objects and relations is explicit,\nand, given the extent of disagreement among philosophers about these\nmatters, the sources cited here and in general should be read with the\npossible differences in terminology in mind.\n\n(2)\nThere are relations (or relational facts) that do not supervene on\nthe intrinsic and spatio-temporal properties of their relata.\n\n\nThe interpretation of entangled states in quantum mechanics in terms\nof strongly non-supervenient relations is due to Carol Cleland (1984).\nHowever, the idea that there could be relations which do not supervene\non the non-relational properties of their relata runs counter to a\ndeeply entrenched way of thinking among some philosophers, whose\nconception of structure is usually based on predicate logic and set\ntheory. Hence, it is often assumed that a structure is fundamentally\ncomposed of individuals and their intrinsic properties, on which all\nrelational structure supervenes. The view that this conceptual\nstructure reflects the structure of the world is called\n\u201cparticularism\u201d by Paul Teller (1989) and \u201cexclusive\nmonadism\u201d by Dipert (1997). It has been endorsed by many\nphilosophers, including Aristotle and Leibniz.\n\nSpatio-temporal relations might be exempted from this prescription\nsince the idea that the position of an object is intrinsic to it is\nassociated with a very strong form of substantivalism. Hence, a\nstandard view is that the relations between individuals other than\ntheir spatio-temporal relations supervene on the intrinsic properties\nof the relata and their spatio-temporal relations. This is David\nLewis\u2019s Humean supervenience:\n\n\n[A]ll there is to the world is a vast mosaic of local matters of\nparticular fact, just one little thing and then another \u2026 We\nhave geometry: a system of external relations of spatio temporal\ndistance between points (of spacetime, point matter, aether or fields\nor both). And at these points we have local qualities: perfectly\nnatural intrinsic properties which need nothing bigger than a point at\nwhich to be instantiated \u2026 All else supervenes on that. (1986:\nx)\n\n\nTim Maudlin argues against this on the basis of quantum entanglement\nand argues that this means the end of ontological reductionism, and\nabandoning the combinatorial conception of reality that comes from\nthinking of the world as made of building blocks, each of which exists\nindependently of the others (1998: 59) and: \u201cThe world is not\njust a set of separately existing localized objects, externally\nrelated only by space and time\u201d (1998: 60). Similarly, advocates\nof OSR such as French and Ladyman emphasise that the non-supervenient\nrelations implied by quantum entanglement undermine the ontological\npriority conferred on individuals in most traditional metaphysics.\nSome relations are at least ontologically on a par with individuals,\nso either relations are ontologically primary, or neither is\nontologically primary or secondary. (Oliver Pooley 2006 and Esfeld\n& Lam 2008 hold the latter view, but Esfeld 2003, 2004 goes\nfurther and claims that if there are intrinsic properties they are\nontologically secondary and derivative of relational properties [see\nbelow].) Primitive nonsupervenient relations of entanglement are a\nform of primitive modal structure. As discussed above and below, many\nadvocates of OSR take the objective modal structure of the world to be\nontologically fundamental, in the sense of not supervening on the\nintrinsic and spatio-temporal properties of their relata. The\noperational theory research programme in physics considers quantum\nmechanics in a more general space of theories that is analogous to the\nspace of possible worlds of modal logic. Emily Adlam (2022) interprets\nthe different constraints placed on correlations in different\noperational theories as different specifications of modal structure.\nSee also Constructor Theory (Deutsch 2013), which is a formalism for\nphysical theories based on possible and impossible transformations of\nstates.\n\n(3)\nIndividual objects have no intrinsic natures.\n\n\nOn this view, individual objects of a particular kind are\nqualitatively identical. They are not individuated by an haecceity or\nprimitive thisness. Classical particles can be and often are so\nregarded, because if a principle of impenetrability is adhered to, no\ntwo such particles ever have all the same spatio-temporal properties.\nIf there are spatio-temporal properties that distinguish each thing\nfrom every other thing, the identity and individuality of physical\nobjects can be reduced to other facts about them. The bundle theory of\nindividuation was developed by empiricists to account for the\nindividuation of physical objects in terms of properties that are\nwithin the reach of natural science (such properties are called\n\u201cqualitative\u201d by Saunders).\n\nThis is a standard metaphysical position that implies nothing so\nradical as any version of OSR. It is relevant because it is often\ntaken to require the Principle of the Identity of Indiscernibles\n(PII), which states in contrapositive form that there are no distinct\nobjects having all the same properties (the discernibility of the\ndistinct). PII is trivially true if its scope is taken to include\nproperties that involve particular objects such as haecceities since\nclearly no two objects have the same haecceity, so it must be\nrestricted so that such properties are not in its scope. The problem\nwith PII is that prima facie in Quantum Mechanics entangled quantum\nstates of many particles attribute exactly the same intrinsic and\nrelational properties to each of them. For example, the famous singlet\nstate of two fermions, such as electrons, attributes to the pair the\nrelation that their spins in any given direction are opposite to each\nother, but does not attribute a definite spin in any direction to\neither particle alone. Given that they may also be attributed exactly\nthe same spatial wavefunction, as when they are both in the first\norbit of an atom, for example, then such particles would seem to\nviolate PII. This leads to a dilemma that was articulated by Steven\nFrench and Michael Redhead (1988); either quantum particles are not\nindividuals, or they are individuals but the principle of\nindividuation that applies to them must make reference to some kind of\nempirically transcendent haecceity, bare particularity or the\nlike.\n\nFrench and Krause (2006) argue that quantum particles and spacetime\npoints are not individuals, but that they are objects in a minimal\nsense, and they develop a non-classical logic according to which such\nnon-individual objects can be the values of first-order variables, but\nones for which the law of identity, \u201cfor all x,\nx is identical to x\u201d, does not hold (but\nneither does \u201cx is not identical to x\u201d).\nKatherine Brading and Alexander Skiles (2012) consider the\nplausibility of arguing for structural realism on the basis of this\nunderdetermination. The relationship between OSR and PII is assessed\nin Ainsworth (2011). The appeal to this problem of metaphysical\nunderdetermination is criticised by Chakravartty (2003), who argues\nthat it cannot be significant since it also obtains in the case of\neveryday objects. Morganti (2004) argues in favour of transcendental\nindividuation, and also points out that if quantum mechanics is not\ncomplete and there are hidden variables as in Bohm theory, the quantum\nparticles may be individuated by their intrinsic and spatio-temporal\nproperties after all. Saunders argues that there is no\nunderdetermination for reasons explained in\n (5)\n below.\n\n(4)\nThere are individual objects or things, but they do not have any\nirreducibly intrinsic properties.\n\n\nMichael Esfeld (2004) rejects\n (1)\n and argues that:\n\n\n(a) relations require relata\n\n\nbut denies that:\n\n\n(b) these relata must have intrinsic properties over and above the\nrelations in which they stand.\n\n\nAs mentioned above Esfeld holds that there are things and relations\nbut neither is ontologically primary or secondary. On this view, all\nthe properties of individual objects are relations to other objects.\nThis view is called \u201cmoderate structural realism\u201d by\nEsfeld (and Esfeld & Lam 2008, 2011 and see also Lam & Esfeld\n2012). It avoids the problems with\n (1)\n above, and is compatible with\n (2)\n and\n (3).\n Any version of\n (4)\n that is combined with (3) arguably makes individuals ontologically\ndependent on relational structure (see\n (6)\n below).\n\nBenacerraf (1965) argues that there cannot be objects possessing only\nstructural properties. The idea of such objects is denounced as\n\u201cmysticism\u201d by Dummett (1991), and criticised in the\ncontext of structural realism by Busch (2003). These objections go\nback to Russell:\n\n\n\u2026it is impossible that the ordinals should be, as Dedekind\nsuggests, nothing but the terms of such relations as constitute a\nprogression. If they are to be anything at all, they must be\nintrinsically something; they must differ from other entities as\npoints from instants, or colours from sounds. What Dedekind intended\nto indicate was probably a definition by means of the principle of\nabstraction\u2026But a definition so made always indicates some\nclass of entities having\u2026 a genuine nature of their own (1903:\n249 [ch. XXX, \u00a7 242]).\n\n\nOn the other hand, D.W. Mertz (1996) defends \u201cnetwork instance\nrealism\u201d and rejects the \u201ctyranny of the monadic\u201d\narguing that individuated relation instances are ontologically\nfundamental. McKenzie (2016) argues on the basis of considering\nfundamentality in particle physics that particles are not defined by\nintrinsic properties.\n\n(5)\nFacts about the identity and diversity of objects are\nontologically dependent on the relational structures of which they are\npart.\n\n\nSaunders (2003a, 2003b and 2006) argues that there is a notion of\ndiscernibility (discussed by Quine 1976) that is satisfied even by\nelectrons in the singlet state described above. Two objects are\n\u201cweakly discernible\u201d iff they satisfy some relation that\nis irreflexive in the pair of them. By the uncontentious converse of\nPII, sometimes known as \u201cLeibniz\u2019 law\u201d, namely the\nPrinciple of the Indiscernibility of Identicals (or contrapositively\nput, the Distinctness of the Discernible), if the relation\n\\(a\\mathbin{R}b\\) holds but the relation \\(b\\mathbin{R}a\\) does not,\nthen there must be distinct relata \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Electrons in the\nsinglet state stand in the relation of having opposite spin, and, an\nelectron cannot have an opposite spin to itself, so, argues Saunders,\nthey are weakly discernible. In this way the facts about the identity\nand diversity of objects are ontologically dependent on the\nqualitative relations they bear to each other.\n\nThis runs counter to the usual way of thinking according to which\nthere are individuals in spacetime whose existence is independent of\neach other, and facts about the identity and diversity of these\nindividuals are determined independently of their relations to each\nother (Stachel 2006 calls this \u201cintrinsic individuality\u201d).\nIt is widely held that relations between individuals cannot\nindividuate (account for the identity and diversity) of those same\nindividuals or, as it is often put, \u201crelations presuppose\nnumerical diversity and so cannot account for it\u201d. The argument\nis that without distinct individuals that are metaphysically prior to\na relation, there is nothing to stand in the relation irreflexively\nthat is supposed to confer individuality on the relata. The issue was\nfamously discussed by Russell (1911), and see also MacBride (2006).\nLadyman and Ross (2007), Saunders (2006) and Stachel (2006) argue that\nfacts about the identity and diversity of fermions are not intrinsic,\nand obtain only in virtue of the relations into which they enter. On\nthis view the individuality of quantum particles is ontologically on a\npar with, or secondary to the relational structure of which they are\nparts. Stachel (2006) calls this \u201ccontextual\nindividuality\u201d and he extends this to spacetime points (see\n \u00a74.3\n below).\n\nHannes Leitgeb and Ladyman (2007) note that in the case of\nmathematical structures there is nothing to rule out the possibility\nthat the identity and diversity of objects in a structure is a\nprimitive feature of the structure as a whole that is not accounted\nfor by any other facts about it (Ladyman (2007) also discusses such\nprimitive contextual individuality). One important question so far not\nmuch discussed is whether on the contextualist view the identity and\ndiversity of the objects depends on the whole structure or just part\nof it. Another important issue is which if either of identity and\ndiversity is primitive. Ladyman, Linnebo, and Pettigrew (2012) present\nsome results about the relative strengths of different forms of\ndiscernibility in languages with and without names and identity (see\nalso Ladyman 2015, 2016). In particular it turns out that weak\ndiscernibility in a language without names is equivalent to absolute\ndiscernibility in a language with names. In the light of this it is\nperhaps not surprising that in the recent literature the position that\nquantum particles can be absolutely discerned after all is defended in\ndifferent ways by various authors (see Bigaj 2022 for a recent and\ncomprehensive discussion of questions about the identity and\nindividuality of quantum particles). Bigaj (2014) interprets the\nontological dependence of objects on relational structures in terms of\ncounterfactual identification, not identity and diversity, to propose\nan essentialist version of non-eliminativist OSR. For criticism of\nnon-eliminative OSR in particular see Chakravartty (2012).\n\n(6)\nThere are no self-subsistent objects, and relational structure is\nontologically subsistent.\n\n\nThis claim is associated with quantum holism and holism more generally\n(see Horgan & Potrc 2000 and 2002). As mentioned above this is\narguably implied by the conjunction of\n (3)\n and\n (4),\n and also by\n (5).\n The basic idea of ontological self-subsistence is that of being able\nto exist without anything else existing. The notions of ontological\ndependence and ontological subsistence are often employed in\ndiscussions of structuralism, but are in need of clarification (see\nLinnebo 2007). Kerry McKenzie (2014) uses Fine\u2019s recent analyses\nof ontological dependence to argue against eliminativist OSR and in\nfavour of moderate structural realism based on a case study from\nparticle physics, and McKenzie (2020) formulates OSR in terms of\ndetermination. Vassallo, Naranjo, and Koslowski (2022) defend a\nmetaphysics of self-subsisting structures for classical mechanics.\n\n(7)\nIndividual objects are constructs\n\n\nFrench (1999) and French and Ladyman (2003a) maintain that individuals\nhave only a heuristic role. Poincar\u00e9 similarly argued that\n\u201cthe gross matter which is furnished us by our sensations was\nbut a crutch for our infirmity\u201d (1898: 41). Ladyman and Ross\n(2007) argue that objects are pragmatic devices used by agents to\norient themselves in regions of spacetime, and to construct\napproximate representations of the world. Anyone who defends\neliminativism as in\n (1)\n above must similarly offer a non-ad hoc account of the point\nand value of reference to and generalization over objects in science.\nFor example, cognitive science may show that we are not able to think\nabout certain domains without hypostatising individuals as the bearers\nof structure. This is a subject for further study.\n\nThe articles in Landry and Rickles (2012) explore some of the above\nissues. See McKenzie\u2019s (2013) review of the collection. See also\nthe collection Bokulich and Bokulich (2011). Jo Wolff (2012) considers\nthe relationship between objects and structures, arguing that the\nformer are not reducible to the latter, and suggesting that a form of\nontic structural realism may be defended in terms of the claim that\nobjects are ontologically dependent on structures.\n4.1 OSR and Group Theory\n\nA symmetry is a transformation of some structure or object which\nleaves it unchanged in some respect. A group of symmetry\ntransformations is a mathematical entity comprising the set of\ntransformations, including the identity transformation and an inverse\nof each transformation, and the operation of composing them, where the\nresult of two composed transformations is also itself in the original\nset. Mathematical objects can be characterised in terms of which\nsymmetry transformations leave them unchanged or invariant, and\nsymmetries of various kinds are associated with physical laws (see the\nentry on\n symmetry and symmetry breaking).\n Poincar\u00e9 first understood the Galilean and Lorentz\ntransformations as groups. These groups express fundamental features\nof reality, namely the dynamical symmetries of Newtonian and\nEinsteinian physics respectively. Poincar\u00e9 understands group\nstructure in Kantian terms as a pure form of the understanding in\naccordance with his epistemic form of structuralism.\n\nOther pioneers of structuralism shared his appreciation of the\nimportance of group theory in the metaphysics of physics. Cassirer\nheld that the possibility of talking of \u201cobjects\u201d in a\ncontext is the possibility of individuating invariants (1938 [1944]).\nSimilarly, Max Born says:\n\n\nInvariants are the concepts of which science speaks in the same way as\nordinary language speaks of \u2018things\u2019, and which it\nprovides with names as if they were ordinary things, (1953: 149)\n\n\nand:\n\n\nThe feature which suggests reality is always some kind of invariance\nof a structure independent of the aspect, the projection. (1953:\n149)\n\n\nHe goes so far as to say:\n\n\nI think the idea of invariant is the clue to a relational concept of\nreality, not only in physics but in every aspect of the world. (1953:\n144)\n\n\nEddington says:\n\n\nWhat sort of thing is it that I know? The answer is\nstructure. To be quite precise it is structure of the kind\ndefined and investigated in the mathematical theory of groups. (1939:\n147)\n\n\nThe idea then is that we have various representations of some physical\nstructure which may be transformed or translated into one another, and\nthen we have an invariant state under such transformations which\nrepresents the objective state of affairs. The group structure is\nprimary and the group representations constructed from this structure\nhave a derivative status. Representations are extraneous to physical\nstates but they allow our empirical knowledge of them. Objects are\npicked out by the identification of invariants with respect to the\ntransformations relevant to the context. Thus, on this view,\nelementary particles are hypostatisations of sets of quantities that\nare invariant under the symmetry groups of particle physics.\n\nFor example, one of the most fundamental distinctions between kinds of\nparticles is that between fermions and bosons. This was described\ngroup theoretically by Weyl and Wigner in terms of the group of\npermutations, and the former\u2019s approach to relativity theory was\nsimilarly group-theoretic. In the case of quantum mechanics Weyl\nasserts that:\n\n\nAll quantum numbers, with the exception of the so-called principal\nquantum number, are indices characterising representations of groups.\n(1928/1931 [1931: xxi])\n\n\nThe central point of philosophical relevance here is that the\nmathematical idea of invariance is taken by Weyl to characterise the\nnotion of objectivity. It is this that liberates physics from the\nparochial confines of a particular coordinate system. For Weyl\nappearances are open only to intuition (in the Kantian sense of\nsubjective perception) and therefore agreement is obtained by giving\nobjective status only to those relations that are invariant under\nparticular transformations.\n\nWeyl\u2019s views were revived by Sunny Auyang (1995) in an\nexplicitly neo-Kantian project which attempts to solve the problem of\nobjectivity in quantum mechanics and quantum field theory (QFT).\nAuyang seeks to extract the \u201cprimitive conceptual\nstructure\u201d in physical theories and she too finds it in what she\ncalls the \u201crepresentation-transformation-invariant\nstructure\u201d. This is essentially group-theoretic structure.\nAuyang, like Born and Weyl, thinks that such invariant structure under\ntransformations is what separates an objective state of affairs from\nits various representations, or manifestations to observers under\ndifferent perceptual conditions. According to her events are\nindividuated structurally.\n\nRyckman (2005) describes the history of relativity theory and\nWeyl\u2019s role in it. Ryckman argues that the work of Eddington and\nWeyl was profoundly influenced by the phenomenology of Husserl. The\nlatter also seems to have understood objectivity in terms of\ninvariance. (Ryckman calls Kantian structural realism\n\u201ctranscendental structuralism\u201d. OSR is what he calls\n\u201ctranscendent structuralism\u201d.) Group theory in the\ndevelopment of structuralism deserves further historical analysis. It\nplayed a crucial role in epistemological reflections on geometry in\nrelation to Klein\u2019s Erlanger programme (Birkhoff & Bennett\n1988). French (1998, 1999, 2000) and Castellani (1998a) have explored\nthe ontological representation of the fundamental objects of physics\nin terms of sets of group-theoretic invariants by Cassirer, Eddington,\nSchr\u00f6dinger, Weyl, Wigner, Piron, Jauch and others. See Bueno\n(2019), and Marquis (2020) for a recent discussion of structuralism in\nthe history of mathematics in which group theory played a prominent\nrole as it does in quantum field theory. On the other hand, Roberts\n(2011) criticizes the idea that structure can be understood as group\nstructure in the context of quantum physics. Others have used other\nparts of mathematics to understand structuralism. Hannes Leitgeb\n(2021) develops a non-eliminative structuralism about graphs. See\n \u00a74.2\n below for OSR and category theory, and\n \u00a74.4\n and\n \u00a76\n for OSR and information theory.\n4.2 OSR and Quantum Field Theory\n\nThere are states of quantum fields that can be identified with there\nbeing definite numbers of particular particles, but general states\ncannot. Particles are standardly thought of as particular excitations\nof the field sometimes called \u201cfield quanta\u201d. Hence, the\nproblem of metaphysical underdetermination raised by French and\nRedhead (1988) in the context of non-relativistic many particle\nquantum mechanics is obviated in the context of quantum field theory,\nbecause a particles-as-individuals view is not an option since, loose\nidentifications of particles and field quanta not withstanding, field\nquanta are not individual things (see Bigaj 2018). Redhead (1999)\nreviews the interpretative issues with QFT and argues for OSR in the\nlight of them. Much earlier, Cassirer rejected the Aristotelian idea\nof individual substances on the basis of physics, and argued that the\nmetaphysical view of the \u201cmaterial point\u201d as an individual\nobject cannot be sustained in the context of field theory. He offers a\nstructuralist conception of the field:\n\n\nThe field is not a \u201cthing\u201d, it is a system of effects\n(Wirkungen), and from this system no individual element can\nbe isolated and retained as permanent, as being \u201cidentical with\nitself\u201d through the course of time. The individual electron no\nlonger has any substantiality in the sense that it per se est et\nper se concipitur; it \u201cexists\u201d only in its relation\nto the field, as a \u201csingular location\u201d in it. (1936 [1956:\n178])\n\n\nCao in his book on quantum field theory sometimes sounds like an ontic\nstructural realist, because he denies that the structures postulated\nby field theories must be \u201contologically supported by\nunobservable entities\u201d (Cao 1997: 5). However, in his (2003a) he\nexplicitly criticises OSR and argues for a version of ESR in the\ncontext of a discussion of quantum field theory. Saunders (2003c and\nd) also criticises Cao for underestimating the difficulties with a\nnon-structuralist form of realism in the light of the history of\nquantum field theory. Berghofer (2018) argues that quantum fields have\nintrinsic properties and that this undermines OSR.\n\nIn gauge quantum field theories, which are our best current physical\ntheories of all the forces other than gravity, each field is\nassociated with a particular symmetry group, and the unification of\ntheories was achieved by looking for theoretical structures with the\nrelevant combined symmetry (U(1) for quantum electrodynamics, U(2) for\nthe electroweak theory and SU(3)/Z(3) for the strong interaction.)\nLyre argues for OSR in the interpretation of gauge symmetry. He argues\nthat\n\n\nthe traditional picture of spatiotemporally fixed object-like entities\nis undermined by the ontology of gauge theories in various ways and\nthat main problems with traditional scientific realism\u2026can be\nsoftened by a commitment to the structural content of gauge theories,\nin particular to gauge symmetry groups. (2004: 666)\n\n\nHe goes on to note that his favoured interpretation of gauge theories\n(in terms of non-separable holonomies) is one according to which the\nfundamental objects are ontologically secondary to structure because\nthe objects of a theory are members of equivalence classes under\nsymmetry transformations and no further individuation of objects is\npossible. Similarly, Kantorovich (2003) argues that the symmetries of\nthe strong force are ontologically prior to the particles that feel\nthat force, namely the hadrons, and likewise for the symmetries of the\nso-called \u201cgrand unification\u201d of particle physics in the\nStandard Model of particle physics (but see McKenzie (2014) for a\ndifferent view as cited above). However, There are \u201cunitarily\ninequivalent\u201d representations of the algebra of quantum field\ntheories, and Howard (2011) and Ruetsche (2011) argue that this poses\na problem for algebraic conceptions of structure. French (2012)\nresponds, while David Glick (2016) argues for pluralism about\nstructure in OSR on the basis of unitary inequivalence. McCabe (2007)\npresents the structure and interpretation of the Standard Model in\nontic structural realist terms saying:\n\n\nIn terms of structural realism...fibre bundle cross-sections can be\ntreated as the structures which lie beyond the empirical phenomena.\n(2007: 6)\n\n\nFrench (2019b) addresses the Standard Model in terms of his account of\nOSR. Federico Benitez (2023) distinguishes between framework theories\nand interaction theories in assssing structural realism in the context\nof the Standard Model.\n\nThe ontology of fields and especially the status of vacuua, virtual\nparticles and gauge fields is much contested. Malament (1996) and\nHalvorson and Clifton (2002), among others, argue that there is a\nfundamental conflict between relativistic quantum field theory and the\nexistence of localisable particles. Similarly, when it comes to\nquantum field theory in a curved spacetime, \u201ca useful particle\ninterpretation of states does not, in general, exist\u201d (Wald\n1994: 47, quoted in Stachel 2006: 58). Fraser (2008) argues that there\nare no particles in quantum field theory on the basis of a theorem in\nalgebraic quantum field theory (Haag\u2019s theorem). Wallace (2006,\n2011) adopts a different approach, considering the practice of\nLagrangian or \u201ceffective\u201d quantum field theory, which\nmakes explicit that the theory does not describe interactions at\ncertain energy and length scales, and arguing for a view of particles\nas scale-dependent emergent entities. Ladyman (2015) similarly argues\nthat the current scientific understanding of particles exemplifies the\nclaims of Ladyman and Ross (2007) that composition is dynamical, and\nthat ontology is scale-relative.\n\nIf fields are construed as properties of space-time points or regions\nand then the issue becomes whether the spacetime points are\nindividuals and this question is bound up with the debate about\nsubstantivalism in the foundations of General Relativity as discussed\nin the next section.\n4.3 OSR and Spacetime Physics\n\nThere has been much dispute about how General Relativity relates to\nrelationism and substantivalism about space and time. The main problem\nfor the latter is the general covariance of the field equations of\nGeneral Relativity: any spacetime model and its image under a\ndiffeomorphism (a infinitely differentiable, one-one and onto mapping\nof the model to itself) are in all observable respects equivalent to\none another; all physical properties are expressed in terms of\ngenerally covariant relationships between geometrical objects. Put\ncrudely, since the points of spacetime are intrinsically indiscernible\none from another, it makes no difference if we (smoothly) swap their\nproperties around so long as the overall structure remains the same.\nThis is made more apparent by the so-called \u201chole\nargument\u201d, which constructs diffeomorphic models such that if\nthey are regarded as physically distinct then there is a breakdown of\ndeterminism. John Earman and John Norton (1987) argue that\nsubstantivalists cannot just bite the bullet and accept this because\nthe question of determinism ought to be settled on empirical/physical\ngrounds and not a priori ones.\n\nThere have been a variety of responses to this problem. Lewis (1986)\nand Carol Brighouse (1994) suggest accepting haecceitism about\nspacetime points, but argue that it should not worry us that\nhaecceitistic determinism, that is determinism with respect to which\npoints end up with which metrical properties, fails. Melia (1999)\ncriticises the notion of determinism employed by Earman and Norton.\nNonetheless most philosophers of physics seem to have concluded that\nif spacetime points do have primitive identity, then the\nsubstantivalist who is committed to them must regard the failure of\nhaecceitistic determinism as a genuine failure of determinism. Hence,\nothers have sought to modify substantivalism. Carl Hoefer argues that\nthe problems for spacetime substantivalism turn on the\n\u201cascription of primitive identity to space-time points\u201d\n(1996: 11). Hence, it seems that interpreting spacetime in terms of an\nontology of underlying entities and their properties causes problems\nfor realism about spacetime.\n\nIn response various authors have adopted structural realism about\nspacetime. Robert DiSalle (1994) suggests that the correct response to\nthe hole argument is that the structure of spacetime be accepted as\nexistent despite its failure to supervene on the reality of spacetime\npoints. (Masoumi (2021a) also thinks that consideration of the hole\nargument supports OSR.) This is akin to the position developed by\nStein (1968) in his famous exchange with Gr\u00fcnbaum, according to\nwhich spacetime is neither a substance, not a set of relations between\nsubstances, but a structure in its own right. Similarly, Oliver Pooley\n(2007) argues that eliminativism about individual spacetime points can\nbe avoided without any tension with General Relativity, if it is\naccepted that the facts about their identity and diversity is grounded\nin relations they bear to each other. His sophisticated\nsubstantivalism allows that spacetime points be individuated\nrelationally and not independently of the metric field. This means\nembracing contextual individuality grounded in relational structure.\nSee also Cassirer who says:\n\n\nTo such a [spacetime] point also no being in itself can be ascribed;\nit is constituted by a definite aggregate of relations and consists in\nthis aggregate. (1936 [1956: 195])\n\n\nThe analogy between the debate about substantivalism, and the debate\nabout whether quantum particles are individuals made by Ladyman\n(1998), Stachel (2002 and 2006), and Saunders (2003a,b) is contested\nby Pooley (2006). He argues that there is no such analogy, or at least\nnot a very deep one, on the grounds that there is no metaphysical\nunderdetermination in GR. According to him the standard formulations\nof the theory are ontologically committed to the metric field, and the\nlatter is most naturally interpreted as representing \u201cspacetime\nstructure\u201d (90).\n\nOthers who have discussed structural realism and spacetime include,\nDorato (2000) who discusses spacetime and structural realism but\nrejects OSR, Esfeld and Lam (2008 and 2011) who argue for moderate\nontic structural realism about spacetime (as defined above), and Bain\n(2006), who says that:\n\n\nConformal structure, for instance, can be realised on many different\ntypes of \u201cindividuals\u201d: manifold points, twisters, or\nmultivectors \u2026What is real, the spacetime structuralist will\nclaim, is the structure itself and not the manner in which alternative\nformalisms instantiate it. (2006: 64)\n\n\nThere are interesting connections between spacetime structuralism and\nthe spacetime functionalism of Eleanor Knox (2019). Bain (2013) argues\nthat critics of radical ontic structural realism have implicitly\nrelied on a set-theoretic notion of structure and that a category\ntheoretic formulation of ontic structural realism is useful in\nexplicating the structure of physical theories, in particular, general\nrelativity. Lal and Teh (2017) respond to Bain downplaying the\nsignificance of category theory for structuralism, but their arguments\nare contested by Eva (2016). Quantum gravity and structuralism is\ndiscussed by philosophers and physicists in Rickles, French, and\nSaatsi (2006).\n4.4 OSR and the Special Sciences\n\nMuch of the work on ontic structural realism focuses on physics, but\nvarious authors have applied it much more widely. Gower (2000) argues\nthat structural realism seems less plausible about theories from\noutside of physics, and Mark Newman (2005) argues that structural\nrealism only applies to the mathematical sciences in therefore cannot\naccount for retention of theoretical commitments across theory change\nin, for example, biology. However, Sarkar (2020) is more optimistic\nabout the prospects for structural realism in biology if the focus is\non organisational structure rather than laws, and French (2011 and\n2014) also considers the implications of his form of ontic structural\nrealism for the ontology of biology. French (2016) defends eliminative\nOSR across the sciences. On the other hand, Ladyman and Ross (2007)\nargue for OSR as part of a form of realism about the sciences as a\nwhole, invoking the idea of real patterns due to Dennett and developed\nas part of Ross\u2019s \u201crainforest realism\u201d (see below).\nHarold Kincaid (2008) and Ross (2008) defend structural realist\napproaches to the social sciences. Tulodziecki (2016) considers the\nprospects of structural realism beyond physics. Ladyman (2008)\nconsiders the causal exclusion problem in the light of OSR, as does\nCordovil et al (2023). Beni (2019) develops a form of structural\nrealism for the cognitive sciences based on an analysis of\nrepresentation and the scientific understanding of the brain in terms\nof connectionist networks and activation patterns. Ryan Nefdt (2021,\n2023) develops a structural realist account of generative linguistics.\nPierpaolo Donati and Margaret Archer (2015) argue for a relational\nontology of individuals in sociology.\n\nThere are two ideas of general application to the special sciences\nassociated with OSR, namely, effective ontology and real patterns.\nTogether they provide for a degree of reconciliation of entity realism\nand structural realism in recent work, and both involve the idea of\nmodal structure which is of wider signficance. Arguably in all of\nscience except perhaps the ultimate physics, ontology is required only\nto be \u201ceffective\u201d in the sense of applying in some domain\nor regime which may be characterised in terms of the kinds of\nprocesses involved, or in terms of scales of energy, length and time.\nMost of physics is in fact like the special sciences in the sense of\nnot being fundamental, and not being applicable in all domains or\nregimes. For example, most of condensed matter physics \u2014 the\nstudy of all the properties of solids and liquids\u2014is not\napplicable to energy scales at which there is no ordinary matter, as\nin the heart of the sun or in the early universe. In physics,\nquasi-particles like phonons are taken to exist when their half-life\nis effectively infinite relative to the scale of the interactions that\nare being studied. As mentioned above, the quantum field theories of\nthe Standard Model of particle physics, and many other if not all\ntheories in physics are effective (see Wells 2012). In general,\nLadyman and Ross (2007) argue that ontology is scale-relative, in the\nsense that different energy levels and regimes, as well as different\nlength and time scales, feature different emergent structures of\ncausation and law, and that we should not assume that there is a\nfundamental level to reality.\n\nThe question of how the ontologies of the special sciences relate to\nmore fundamental theories obviously relates to structural realism\nbecause in many cases the strongly empirically successful theories of\nthe past are also the theories currently used in the relevant domain\n(see Robertson and Wilson forthcoming). For example, engineers and\nphysicists still use Newtonian forces and classical optics despite the\nfact the theories about them have more fundamental successors. The\nontology of such theories is effective as part of successful\nexplanations and predictions. The idea of effective ontology readily\nrelates to Dennett\u2019s idea of real patterns. A real pattern is,\nvery roughly, something that makes for a simplified description\nrelative to some background ontology. Real patterns are entities of\nwhatever ontological category that feature non-redundantly in\nprojectable regularities. For example, a wave on the beach is a real\npattern to a surfer, or a lifeguard, because it is taken as the basis\nfor prediction and explanation. Waves are ephemeral and fuzzy real\npatterns, and in general real patterns are more or less definite and\ndurable. David Wallace (2003) argues for the real-patterns account of\neffective emergent entities including worlds in the Everett\ninterpretation as well as quasi-particles. Seifert (forthcoming)\napplies the idea of real patterns to chemical bonds which must also be\nconsidered as part of effective ontology. The precise definition of\nreal patterns is a matter of debate. Ross sought to improve on\nDennett\u2019s original definition, Ladyman and Ross further refined\nit, and Su\u00f1\u00e9 and Mart\u00ednez (2021) criticise them\nand develop their own account. All agree that real patterns must be\nprojectable in the sense of supporting prediction and explanation and\nhence modal. It is natural to characterise this in\ninformation-theoretic term in terms of compressibility, though it may\nalso be thought about in terms of reduction in the effective number of\ndegrees of freedom needed to model the dynamics of the system\n(Millhouse 2021 argues that compressibility is not apt for capturing\nreal patterns that are coarse-grained with respect to the underlying\nontology).\n\nLadyman and Ross (2007) defend Rainforest Realism, which is realism\nabout the ontologies of the special sciences, by conjoining it with\nontic structural realism in the philosophy of physics. They adopt\nscientific realism about effective ontology, and use their account of\nreal patterns to provide a criterion of existence. According to the\nreal-patterns account old ontologies are retained in much of\nscientific practice because they continue to identify projectible\nregularities in their domains of applicability. Relatedly, David Glick\n(2021) argues that the basis of the structural realist\u2019s reply\nto the problem of theory change may be applied synchronically to allow\nfor a pluralist structural realism. The problems of vagueness of\ncomposition and identity over time, and hence of generation and\ncorruption all apply to both special science objects and everyday\nones. Composition is often dynamical, especially in science, but the\ntimescale of the interactions of the parts is very short compared to\nthe timescale characteristic of the whole. Generation and corruption\nare not events at the level of the parts, but real patterns can indeed\nbe created and destroyed by changes in the behaviour of other real\npatterns, and they can also persist over long time scales relative to\nthe scale of the interactions of their parts. Hence, the real-patterns\naccount of scale-relative ontology might provide a unified solution\nfor both problems (Ladyman 2017). Such an account could be interpreted\nas being of the pragmatics of an ultimately epistemological kind of\nemergence as perhaps for Wallace. However, if there is not, or might\nnot be, a fundamental level of reality, nor ultimate individuals of\nwhich everything else is made, then all real patterns are on a par. In\nthis or some other way, the structural realist, like all scientific\nrealists must give an account of the relationship between the\nontology, causation and law described by theories and models that\napply at different scales and so also in different sciences.\n5. Objections to Structural Realism\n\nAs explained above, there are many different forms of structural\nrealism and correspondingly, many different objections have been\nlevelled against it. Obviously, ESR and OSR attract very different\nkinds of criticism, and different forms of each also face distinctive\nchallenges. Varieties of structural realism and objections to it are\nalso reviewed in Frigg and Votsis (2011). Worrall (2020) defends his\nform of structural realism against objections. Some common objections\nnot already considered above are as follows:\n\n(1)\nStructural realism collapses into standard realism.\n\n\nPsillos (1995) argues that any form of structural realism must\npresuppose a distinction between the form and content of a theory,\nand/or a distinction between our ability to know the structure and our\nability to know the nature of the world. Both these distinctions are\nillusory according to Psillos because the scientific revolution\nbanished mysterious forms and substances that might not be fully\ndescribable in structural terms. For Psillos, properties in mature\nscience are defined by the laws in which they feature, and \u201cthe\nnature and the structure of a physical entity form a continuum\u201d\n(1995: 31). Hence, for Psillos, structural realism is either false or\ncollapses into traditional realism, echoing the response of Richard\nBraithwaite (1953: 463) to Eddington\u2019s structuralism. Similarly,\nDavid Papineau argues that \u201crestriction of belief to structural\nclaims is in fact no restriction at all\u201d (Papineau 1996a: 12),\nhence structural realism gains no advantage over traditional realism\nwith the problem of theory change because it fails to make any\ndistinction between parts of theories that should and should not enjoy\nour ontological commitment. Kyle Stanford (2003b: 570) also argues\nthat we cannot distinguish the structural claims of theories from\ntheir claims about content or natures. As discussed above, the real\npatterns account and the idea of effective ontology can be used to\nreconcile structural realism with entity realism to some extent at\nleast. Clearly, structural realism must be a form of scientific\nrealism, and how distinct the positions are may be a moot point, but\nif scientific realism is not taken to involve a commitment to natural\nnecessity then it is weaker than OSR characterised in terms of\ncommitment to modal structure. Positions such as Chakravartty\u2019s\nsemi-realism (2007) and Massimi\u2019s Perspectival Realism (2022)\nseem to agree with OSR that science describes modal structure.\nHowever, in the former case this is understood in terms of\ndispositions or powers which is too restrictive for most ontic\nstructural realists for whom modal structure must include nomological\nstructure, symmetry, equilibrium explanation and more (see French\n2013). In the case of Perspectival Realism, modal structure is somehow\ntied to epistemic perspectives, and while real patterns are defined in\nterms of perspectives in Ladyman and Ross (2007), their notion of\nperspective is different to that of Massimi.\n\n(2)\nNot all structure is retained on theory change.\n\n\nMany people\u2019s first response to structural realism is to point\nout that mathematical structure is often lost in theory change too\n(see, for example, Chakravartty 2004: 164; Stanford 2003b:\n570\u2013572). If structural realism is understood as a form of\nselective realism seeking to identify what will be retained in advance\nthen this makes it hopeless. However, the structural realist is not\nclaiming that all structure is retained on theory-change, just that\nrepresent the relations among, or structure of, the phenomena in some\ndomain, and in scientific revolutions the empirical content of the old\ntheory is recovered as a limiting case of the new theory (so\nstructural realism is not a form of selective realism, see Ladyman\n2021). Post claimed there are no \u201cKuhn-losses\u201d, in the\nsense of successor theories losing all or part of the well confirmed\nempirical structures of their predecessors (1971: 229). Well-confirmed\nrelations among phenomena must be retained by future theories. This\ngoes beyond mere belief in the empirical adequacy of our theories if\nwe suppose that the relations in question are genuine modal relations\nrather than extensional generalizations about actual phenomena.\nHowever, Newman (2010) argues that structuralism cannot deal with the\npessimistic meta-induction. McArthur (2011) argues that structural\nrealism eliminates both theory change in science and scientific\ndiscovery.\n\n(3)\nStructural realism is too metaphysically revisionary.\n\n\nConsiderations from physics and the history of science do not\nlogically compel us to abandon the idea of a world of distinct\nontologically subsistent individuals with intrinsic properties. The\nidentity and individuality of quantum particles could be grounded in\neach having a primitive thisness, and the same could be true of\nspacetime points. Physics does seem to tell us that certain aspects of\nsuch a world would be unknowable. The epistemic structural realist\nthinks that all we can know is structure, but it is the structure of\nan unknowable realm of individuals. An epistemic structural realist\nmay insist in a Kantian spirit that there being such objects is a\nnecessary condition for our empirical knowledge of the world. It may\nbe argued that it is impossible to conceive of relational structures\nwithout making models of them in terms of domains of individuals.\nCertainly, the structuralist faces a challenge in articulating her\nviews to contemporary philosophers schooled in modern logic and set\ntheory, which retains the classical framework of individual objects,\nand where a structure is just a particular set, namely a set of\nobjects, and a set of relations, where the latter are thought of\nextensionally as just sets of ordered pairs (or more generally\nn-tuples in the case of n-place relations), hence,\nsome structuralists favouring of category theory as noted above.\n\nPsillos (2001) argues that OSR is not \u201cworked out\u201d as a\nmetaphysics, and that a strong burden of proof is on those who would\nabandon traditional metaphysics (see also Chakravartty 2004 and\nMorganti 2011). McKenzie (2017) also complains in a survey of OSR that\nthe view has not been adequately articulated particularly in respect\nof the notions of individual, object and structure. The wealth of work\nreferred to above makes these charges harder to sustain now, and in\nany case it is not clear that OSR\u2019s rivals are \u201cworked\nout\u201d in any sense that OSR is not. There in no general agreement\namong philosophers that any of the metaphysical theories of, say,\nuniversals is adequate, and arguably metaphysical categories inherited\nfrom the ancient Greeks, the scholastics and the early moderns are not\nappropriate for contemporary science. Naturalists argue that we should\nreject metaphysical doctrines if they are not supported by science.\nMichael Esfeld (2004: 614\u2013616) argues against any gap between\nepistemology and metaphysics. Similarly Ladyman and Ross (2007) argue\nfor a kind of verificationism in metaphysics.\n\nA key motivation for OSR is summed up by Ernan McMullin:\n\n\n[I]maginability must not be made the test for ontology. The realist\nclaim is that the scientist is discovering the structures of the\nworld; it is not required in addition that these structures be\nimaginable in the categories of the macroworld. (1984: 14)\n\n\nHowever, of course many metaphysicians do not accept these claims.\n\n(4)\nStructuralists cannot account for causation.\n\n\nBusch (2003), Psillos (2006a) and Chakravartty (2003) all argue that\nindividual objects are central to productive rather than Humean\nconceptions of causation, and hence to any genuine explanation of\nchange. Objects are supposed to provide the \u201cactive\nprinciple\u201d of change and causation. French (2006) replies to\nthis charge invoking the idea of of modal structure discussed above.\nStructural realists think in terms of modal structure rather than\ncausal structure to the extant that physics and other sciences\ndescribe relationships among phenomena of necessity, possibility,\npotentiality, and probability the world in ways that are not readily\nparsed in causal, dispositional or nomological terms. However, Ladyman\nand Ross (2007) argue that causation is very often the pragmatically\nindispensable proxy for modal structure in the sciences. For\ndiscussion of these issues see the \u201cfinal section\u201d of\narticles on modality and causality in structural realism in Landry and\nRickles (2012).\n\n(5)\nWithout positing knowledge of individual objects we cannot explain\nwhy certain properties and relations tend to cohere.\n\n\nThis objection is due to Chakravartty (2003) who points out that\ncertain properties tend to be found together, for example, negative\ncharge and a certain rest mass, and then asks \u201ccoincidence or\nobject?\u201d. French (2006) replies arguing that for a structuralist\nobjects just are literally coincidences and nothing more. Once again\nthe challenge for the critic of structuralism is to show that more\nthan the minimal logical notion of an object is required, but there\nare many contexts in which this seems to be so. In response to this\nproblem, the theory of real patterns could be developed so that so\nthat triangulation among different modes of detection is required for\nontological commitment to objects as opposed to minimal real patterns,\nbut this is a subject for further work. O\u2019Conaill (2014) argues\nthat OSR cannot account for ordinary concrete objects. Saunders (2016)\naccounts for the emergence of macroscopic objects from the quantum in\nterms of decoherence.\n\n(6)\nStructural Realism collapses the distinction between the\nmathematical and the physical.\n\n\nMany structuralists are motivated by the thought that if mathematics\ndescribes its domain only up to isomorphism, if, in other words, it\nonly describes the structure of the domain, once the scientific\ndescription of the world becomes largely mathematical, then scientific\nknowledge too becomes structural knowledge. However, it may then be\nargued that if only the structure of mathematical theories is relevant\nto ontology in mathematics, and only structural aspects of the\nmathematical formalism of physical theories are relevant to ontology\nin physics, then there is nothing to distinguish physical and\nmathematical structure. Van Fraassen argues that the heart of the\nproblem with OSR is this:\n\n\nIt must imply: what has looked like the structure of\nsomething with unknown qualitative features is actually all there\nis to nature. But with this, the contrast between structure and\nwhat is not structure has disappeared. Thus, from the point of view of\none who adopts this position, any difference between it and\n\u201cordinary\u201d scientific realism also disappears. It seems\nthen that, once adopted, it is not to be called structuralism\nat all! For if there is no non-structure, there is no structure\neither. But for those who do not adopt the view, it remains startling:\nfrom an external or prior point of view, it seems to tell us that\nnature needs to be entirely re-conceived. (2006: 292\u2013293)\n\n\nThe essence of van Fraassen\u2019s objection here is that the\ndifference between mathematical (uninstantiated/abstract) structure,\nand physical (instantiated/concrete) structure cannot itself be\nexplained in purely structural terms. There is an analogy here with\nthe theory of universals and the problem of exemplification. A similar\ncomplaint is made by Cao (2003a,b) and discussed in his debate with\nontic structural realists. Esfeld (2013) uses this objection in the\ncontext of the interpretation of quantum mechanics to pose a dilemma\nfor ontic structural realism. Saunders (2003d) points out that there\nis no reason to think that ontic structural realists are committed to\nthe idea that the structure of the world is mathematical, just that it\nis described by it (see also French 2014). Tegmark (2008) explicitly\nembraces a Pythagorean form of OSR, but Ladyman and Ross (2007) argue\nthat no account can be given of what makes the world-structure\nphysical and not mathematical. If OSR is characterised in terms of\nmodal structure then the mathematical structure of a scientific theory\nis understood as representing the modal structure of its domain, not\nas being identical with it.\n\nThere are two main versions of mathematical structuralism: a realist\nview according to which mathematical structures exist independently of\ntheir concrete instantiations; and an eliminativist position according\nto which statements about mathematical structures are disguised\ngeneralisations about their instantiations that exemplify them (see\nShapiro 1997: 149\u2013150.) For an excellent survey see Reck and\nPrice (2000). The most well known advocates of realist structuralism\nin the philosophy of mathematics are Parsons (1990), Resnik (1997) and\nShapiro (1997). Important critiques include Hellman (2005) and\nMacBride (2005). The relationship between ontic structural realism and\nante rem structuralism has been explored by Psillos (2006a),\nBusch (2003), French (2006), Pooley (2006), and Ladyman (2007) among\nothers. Many questions about objects versus individuals and the\nontological priority of objects, properties and relations arise in\ndiscussions of structural realism and mathematical structuralism. Beni\n(2020) argues that the Benacerraf (1965) problem is a problem for\nOSR.\n\n(7)\nStructural realism lacks a clear notion of structure.\n\n\nArenhart and Bueno (2015) argue that the notion of structure is\nunclear, and that when made precise the position becomes indefensible\nmotivating structural empiricism. Kyle Stanford (2010) argues that the\nconsilience argument of Ladyman and Ross (2007) is based on the\nconflation of different kinds of structure. Lyons (2016) argues that\nthe notion of structure deployed in structural realism becomes\nexplanatorily vacuous when confronted with the history of celestial\nmechanics.\n6. Other Structuralisms\n\nAs discussed above, the information-theoretic real patterns approach\nto ontology has been taken up by many ontic structural realists.\nDunlap (2022) explores the connections between information-theoretic\ninterpretations of quantum mechanics and OSR. A different form of\ninformational structural realism in the context of the foundations of\ncomputer science is defended by Floridi (2008), and analysed in Bynum\n(2014) and Wheeler (2022). See also Beni (2016) and Long (2020) for\nthe idea of digital ontology. Bueno (2010) argues that informational\nstructuralism can be developed as a form of empiricist structuralism.\nStructuralism first became popular in analytic metaphysics in the form\nof causal essentialism. This is the doctrine that the causal relations\nthat properties bear to other properties exhaust their natures (see\nfor example, Shoemaker 1980 and Hawthorne 2001). Steven Mumford (2004)\ndefends a structuralist theory of dispositional properties, and\nAlexander Bird\u2019s (2007) theory of dispositions is in some ways\nstructuralist. Anjan Chakravartty\u2019s (2007) deploys dispositional\nessentialism in the defence of scientific realism. Michael Esfeld\n(2009) discusses structuralism about powers. Verity Harte (2002)\ndiscusses an interesting Platonic form of structuralism. Alistair\nIsaac (2014) argues for structural realism for secondary qualities.\nTed Sider (2020) develops a form of structuralism in his approach to\nmetaphysics and philosophical logic.\n",
