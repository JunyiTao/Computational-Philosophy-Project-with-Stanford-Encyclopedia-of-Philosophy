    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\n\nIbn Ezra was likely born in or around 1093 in Tudela, at that time\nwithin the northern reaches of Muslim Spain. There he passed the first\nfive decades of his life, apparently eking out his living as a poet.\nLike so many other Jews, he fled Spain in the face of the Almohade\nonslaughts of 1140. For the next three decades he wandered through\nEurope, spending time in Rome, Lucca, Rouen, London, and\nB\u00e9ziers. Nearly all of the substantial body of writing that he\nleft behind dates to this period. The names of a few of his students,\ncorrespondents, rivals, and patrons are known. We are rather\nwell-informed about Ibn Ezra\u2019s relationship with Judah Halevi; their\nexchanges are very instructive for the history of Jewish philosophy,\nand we will return to them below. On the other hand, none of his\ndisciples (who in any event do not seem to have been numerous) has\nclarified for us any of the \u201csecrets\u201d that Ibn Ezra is\nfond to refer to.\n\n\nIbn Ezra\u2019s literary legacy consists of short and extremely popular\nhandbooks in a wide variety of fields: grammar and poetics, astrology\nand arithmetic, astronomy and religious speculations, as well as both\nshort and lengthier biblical commentaries. Most of his astrological\ntracts circulate in at least two versions; their Latin versions played\na pivotal role in the spread of that art throughout Christian\nEurope. Manuscripts number in many dozens. The biblical commentaries\nare also found in very manuscripts, and they are included in the\nmargins of numerous printings. On the other hand, there are relatively\nfew critical editions of his writings.  This situation has been\nlargely rectified for his astrological writings, surely the most\nimportant part of his corpus, due to the untiring work of Shlomo\nSela. Moreover, Sela\u2019s highly praised editions, studies and translations have\nbrought to light even more texts, in both Hebrew and Latin. (For the\nmost recent inventory of primary sources and secondary studies, see\nSela and Freudenthal 2006; newer editions by Sela are listed in the\nbibliography.) Several long excursuses, for example to Exodus 3:15 or\nExodus 33:21, recap his statements on the main issues. Yesod Mora, a\nmonograph on the rationale underlying the biblical commandments\nwritten very late in his life, also contains a full statement of Ibn\nEzra\u2019s teachings.\n\n\nTwo other short treatises have each a peculiar focus. Sefer\nha-Shem is an enigmatic treatise on God\u2019s proper names\nwritten out with the Hebrew letters AHYH and YHWH. The basic idea is\nthat the special properties of the numbers associated with these\nletters, their phonetic qualities, grammatical functions and graphic\nrepresentations, all convey information about the godhead. Thus, for\ninstance, one (A, aleph) is the foundation of number, but not\na number itself; both five (H, heh) and six (W, waw)\nrepeat themselves as the final digit in all higher powers; and ten (Y,\nyod) is the beginning of the next order in the decimal\nsystem. All this seems to indicate the unchanging aspect of the divine\nin its successive manifestations. The same collection of ideas is\nfound in non-philosophical writings, for example, the grammatical\ntreatise Sefer Zahut.\n\n\nIndeed, if Ibn Ezra can be located within any of the major\nphilosophical traditions, his place is among the\nPythagoreans. Sefer ha-Ehad is Ibn Ezra\u2019s venture in\narithmology. Like the writings of Nicomachus of Gerasa and Philo, as\nwell as a relatively short list of medieval Muslim and Jewish\nauthors, Sefer ha-Ehad follows the Pythagorean tradition of\nlisting which natural, mathematical, and other items, come in two\u2019s,\nthree\u2019s, etc. As we have seen in the preceding paragraph, Ibn Ezra\npressed especially the theological implications of these arithmetic\nproperties.\n\n\nThe two most \u201cphilosophical\u201d of his writings are\nHayy ben Meqitz, a poetic visionary recital to be discussed\nin a separate section below, and Arugat ha-Bosem.  The latter\nis also poetic in style. The doctrine it presents, for example\natomism, is very much part and parcel of the kalam tradition, rather\nthan philosophy, strictly speaking. For that reason, Ibn Ezra\u2019s\nauthorship has been called into question (Greive 1973, 181\u2013189,\nincluding German translation of the entire text). However, even such a\ncommitted neoplatonist as Isaac Israeli had no compunction about\ncontributing to the kalam, and there is no reason a priori to think\nthat the situation would have been different for Ibn Ezra. Allegiances\nto streams of thought in that period were not necessarily\nexclusivist.\u00a0\n\n\nThe two strongest identifiable influences on Ibn Ezra\u2019s thought are the anonymous\ntract known as Sefer Yesira and Sa\u2018adiah Gaon. The\nformer is his acknowledged source for surveying reality according to\nthree parallel schemes: Hebrew letters, numbers, and the cosmos.\nSa\u2018adiah is cited very frequently, over thirty times in the\ncommentary to the Torah alone. Some medieval writers cite from a\ncommentary to Sefer Yesira that they ascribe to Ibn\nEzra. Paul Fenton (2001) has argued that the text in question\nis a Hebrew condensation of the commentary by Dunash Ibn Tam\u00eem,\noriginally written in Arabic, and that Ibn Ezra may indeed have\nprepared the Hebrew version. However, Dunash was a student of Isaac\nIsraeli, who strongly criticized Sa\u2018adiah\u2019s commentary to\nSefer Yesira. Thus Ibn Ezra may, unwittingly, have drawn most\nheavily upon two divergent streams of thought. As we have seen, this\nis not as shocking as it may seem. Ibn Ezra was interested in ideas,\nbut not in putting them all together into one tight and fully coherent\nsystem.\n\n\nA few other sources are named in Yesod Mora: Shi\u2018ur\nQoma, a cryptic writing that, like Sefer Yesira,\nnourished a good deal of speculation, much of it mystical, and a\ncertain Sefer ha-Yihud, which is not extant. These works date\nto the gaonic period which, in Jewish historiography, corresponds to\nvery late antiquity and the early Middle Ages. All in all, then, the\nsources that Ibn Ezra cites by name are a mix of gaonic kalam and\nproto-kabbalistic mysticism. Ibn Ezra adopted the literary format of\nearly gaonic texts for those of his writings that can be called\nphilosophical.  Yesod Mora and Sefer ha-Shem,\n\u201cThe Book of the [Divine] Name\u201d, are dense and cryptic,\nmuch like Sefer Yesira and Shi\u2018ur Qoma.\n\n\nIbn Ezra can be contextualized among the Andalusian philosophizing\nHebrew poets, especially Ibn Gabirol and Halevi. These poets were\nfamiliar in varying degrees with what has come to called Islamic\nneoplatonism; all sought support for their views in the Hebrew Bible,\nsuitably interpreted according to each one\u2019s preferences; and\nall were driven by a strong spiritual thirst. Hebrew poetry was the\nvehicle for expressing their deep religious thirst.\n\n\nThough far less schooled in the philosophical tradition, Ibn\nEzra\u2019s thoughts on emanation are similar to those of Ibn\nGabirol. Indeed, Ibn Gabirol is the only undeniably neoplatonic author\ncited by Ibn Ezra and may represent his only confirmed link to that\ntradition. Ibn Ezra is our only source for some Ibn Gabirol\u2019s\nallegorical readings of verses from Genesis.\n\n\nThroughout his life Ibn Ezra continued to write poetry in a wide\nvariety of styles. Some of his liturgies make use of concepts drawn\nfrom medieval psychology. However, it is not so much the display of\nterminology, as it is the deep, powerful and sincere longings for\nliberation and the divine that are instructive for an appreciation of\nhis thought. Ibn Ezra was no schoolman, but he certainly experienced,\nand expressed in rich and evocative Hebrew, a deep alienation from\nmundane reality and passionate longing to return to the spiritual\nrealm.\n",
