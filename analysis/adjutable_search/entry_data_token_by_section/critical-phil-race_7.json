    "main_text": "The Construction of Racial Identities\n3. The Construction of Racial Identities\n\nIn general, Critical Race Philosophers have started with the view,\nfollowing Alain Locke, that race, even though it is signified by\nphysical attributes, is basically a social kind rather than a natural\nkind (Harris 1989). Locke wrote: \u201cThe best consensus of opinion\nthen seems to be that race is a fact in the social or ethnic sense,\nthat it has been very erroneously associated with race in the physical\nsense\u2026that it has a vital and significant relation to social\nculture, and that it must be explained in terms of social and\nhistorical causes\u2026\u201d (Locke 1916 [1992, 192]). Locke also\nalluded to a contradiction still very much relevant to the debate over\neliminativism, which is how racial consciousness can be both desirable\nand dangerous: desirable in that it recognizes social and historical\nrealities, but dangerous in its potential to sanction prejudice and\noverplay division (Harris 1989, 203).\n",
