Gender and the Study of Mysticism\n\nSome feminist philosophers have criticized what they perceive as the\nandrocentric bias of male philosophers of mysticism. There are three\nmain objections:\n\n\n\nContemporary male philosophers treat mysticism as centered\non private psychological episodes of a solitary person. They\nbelieve these private experiences reveal the meaning and value of\nmysticism (Jantzen 1994 and 1995; also see Turner 1996). Instead,\nphilosophers should be studying the socio-cultural dimensions of\nmysticism, including its patriarchal failings. Sarah Coakley (2009)\nmaintains that the focus of mysticism should be on the ongoing\ncontemplative practice and all that entails. \n\n\nAt times. scholars of mysticism have systematically ignored or\nmarginalized much of women\u2019s mysticism. Closer attention to\nwomen would reveal the androcentric bias in mystical\nstudies (Jantzen 1995). Nancy Caciola (2000 and 2003)\nargues that the criteria the Christian church developed for authentic\nmystical experiences curtailed the power of women in the church. For\nexample, on the basis of theories about female physiology, women were\ndeemed more vulnerable to devil possession than men and so their\nexperiences were more suspect. Coakley (2009) also notes that while\nsome analytic philosophers attend to the mysticism of Teresa of Avila,\nthey do not do justice to the full content of her mystical writings,\npicking out experiences only. \n\n\nThe traditional male construction of God has determined the way male\nphilosophers think of theistic experiences. Thus, theistic experiences\nare conditioned from the outset by patriarchal conceptualizations\nand values, and by sex-role differentiation in the practice of\nreligion (Raphael 1994). \n\n\nUnder this view, men typically understand theistic\nexperience as a human subject encountering a being wholly distinct,\ndistant, and overpowering. A paradigm of this approach is the numinous\nexperience of a \u201cwholly other\u201d reality that is unfathomable\nand overpowering, engendering a sense of dread and fascination in\nwhich the mystic is \u201csubmerged and overwhelmed\u201d by his own\nnothingness (Otto 1957). Otto claims that this is the\nfoundational experience of religion. This approach, it is claimed, is\nmediated by the androcentrism of Otto\u2019s worldview, entrapped in\nissues of domination, atomicity, and submission. Some feminist\nthinkers deny the dichotomy between the holy and the creaturely that\nmakes Otto\u2019s analysis possible\n(Daly 1973, Goldenberg 1979). Feminist theologians\nstress the immanent nature of the object of theistic experiences, and\nbring to prominence women\u2019s experience of the holy in their\nfleshly embodiment, denigrated by androcentric attitudes.\n\nFeminists have also supported the constructivist position in the\nname of anti-essentialism and diversity of experience\n(Lanzetta 2005, chap. 1). Thinking that there is a\ncommon unconstructed essence to mystical experience has worked\nagainst the recognition of women\u2019s experiences as properly\nmystical.\n\nThe feminist critique poses a valuable corrective to unperceived\nandrocentric biases in mysticism and mystical studies. This critique\nshould help neutralize the conception of mysticism and mystical\nexperience as completely private, introduced to philosophy largely by\nWilliam James. Objection (2) has begun to produce scholarship\ndedicated to women\u2019s mysticism and its significance (e.g.,\nHurcombe 1987, Brunn and Epiney-Burgard 1989,\nBeer 1993, Borchert 1994, Hollywood 2002). Several\ncollections on women mystics have helped change the over-emphasis on\nmale mystics (in particular, Furlong 2013). Regarding (3):\nthe rich variegation of religious and mystical experience\namong men throughout history must also be considered. This\nincludes men\u2019s experiences of God\u2019s immanent closeness as\nwell as mystical \u201cunion\u201d with God, unlike Otto\u2019s dualistic\nnuminous experiences. \n\nThe principal impact of the feminist critique on philosophy of\nmysticism would be to give more reasons to expand the consideration of\nmysticism to more than episodic experiences.\n",
