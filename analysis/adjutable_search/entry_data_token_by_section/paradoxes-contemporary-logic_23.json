    "main_text": "A glance at present-day investigations || On the foundations of semantics, again\n6.5 On the foundations of semantics, again\n\nIn the final quarter of the last century a host of logical papers\narise from the discussion of the foundations of semantics, with a\nnumber of proposals which generalize or modify Tarski\u2019s\nsemantical conception of truth. Tarski notwithstanding, since 1975 the\nhierarchical approach has been somewhat superseded by new ideas that\nhave rendered the ideal of logical and semantical closure in many\nrespect accessible (especially by means of the fixed point methods\nused by Kripke 1975 and Martin-Woodruff; see Martin 1984). We also\nmention the approach stemming from Herzberger, Gupta and Belnap 1993\n(see the entry\n revision theory of truth),\n that has connections with non-elementary parts of definability\ntheory, set theory and higher recursion theory (Welch 2001, 2009,\n2011, 2019). This has led to the general axiomatic study of\nrevision-theoretic definitions and theories of circular\ndefinitions (see Bruni 2009, 2013b, 2015, 2019). In Standefer\n2015 a connection is established between Solovay type theorem and\ncircular definitions of revision theory and a particular modal logic\nRT (revision theory): a completeness theorem for this logic, analogous\nto Solovay\u2019s completeness theorem for GL, is proven. The modal\nlogic in question is built upon an operator that is naturally\nconnected with revision-theoretic construction (hence, the name), as\nexplained in Gupta and Standefer 2017. The proof theory of this system\nis studied in Standefer 2018.\n\nRecent advances on revision theory, have contributed to prove the\nfertility of the approach (in a direction related to the last part of\n\u00a76.4 of this entry): Gupta 2011 presents an application to the\nconcept of strategic rationality in a certain type of finite games\nthat is connected to a common way of understanding rational choice in\nstrategic contexts. Although developed independently, Gupta\u2019s\nstance is reminiscent of previous work by H. Gaifman about rationality\nbeing affected by paradoxes resembling the truth theoretic paradoxes\nlike the liar paradox (see Gaifman 1999). An extension of this\napproach to the class of all finite games is presented in Bruni and\nSillari 2018. The notable aspect of Gupta\u2019s application is that\nit makes use of only the finite part of revision theory (i.e., it does\nnot need the transfinite iteration of this construction), and it gets\nrid of the rule for dealing with stages corresponding to limit\nordinals. This limit rule, which is essential to address the concept\nof truth, turned out to be the most critical aspect of the\nrevision-theoretic approach to circular concepts from both the\ncomplexity, and the conceptual point of view (see Campbell-Moore 2019\nfor a recent, new approach to the topic).\n\nThe wealth and variety of semantical tools has triggered a sort of\nexperimenting with a number of mixed proposals. Refinements\nof revision theory and generalizations thereof can be found in Rivello\n2019a e 2019b where a new approach to a formal theory of truth is\ndeveloped, which implements features of Kripke\u2019s fixed point\ntheory with the Herzberger-Gupta revision theory. An analogous\ncombination, studied from a more proof-theoretic angle, was considered\nin Standefer 2017. Similarly, combinations of the possible worlds\nsemantics for the necessity predicate with Kripke\u2019s\nsupervaluational partial models for the truth predicate are also\nstudied by Nicolai 2018.\n\nField (2003, 2008) has proposed influential solutions of the\nsemantical paradoxes which combine Kripkean and revision theoretic\ntechniques. According to him, the present solutions to the paradoxes\nare not satisfactory because of the following points: (i) the lack of\na decent conditional (and biconditional); (ii) the failure of (some\ninstances of) the T-schema (A \u2194 T(\u2308A\u2309); (iii) the\nfailure of intersubstitutivity between A and T(\u2308A\u2309); (iv)\nthe impossibility of providing an internal analysis of the\ndefectiveness of the paradoxical sentences. Field (2008) has\nconsequently developed a theory of truth with a non-classical\nconditional operator, which allows to express a notion of\ndeterminate truth and to state that the Liar is not\ndeterminately true. Analysis of Field\u2019s construction requires\nsophisticated set-theoretic and recursion theoretic\ndevelopments (see Welch 2008, 2009, 2011). Moreover, the\npossibility of logically enriching Kripke\u2019s theory of truth with\nnovel conditionals has opened up new routes: e.g. Rossi\n(2016) provides an interesting method of incorporating a conditional\nconforming to \u0141ukasiewicz three-valued logic in a fixed-point\nconstruction for truth. In the same direction, a considerable\nattention has been directed in recent literature to the so called\nrevenge problem: typical solutions, say, of the Liar paradox,\nrely on notions that, if expressible in the object language, give rise\nto new versions of the paradox. So, the solution is only an illusion.\nThe revenge problem can be instantiated by the so-called Strengthened\nLiar: informally, once we have a model which makes the Liar\nsentence L itself neither true nor false, and we can express this\nvery fact, L is after all not true. But this is the claim made by L,\nand hence L is true. So the paradox seems to show up again (for more\ndetails, see the entry\n liar paradox and\n the collection of essays contained in Beall 2007).\n\n\u201cIndexical\u201d solutions of the Liar have been developed in\nseveral contributions, e.g., by Burge, Gaifman, Simmons. The idea is\nthat the Liar paradox does not involve sentences, but specific\noccurrences of sentences, i.e., sentence tokens (this idea is to\nbe found already in scholastic solutions). For the sake of historical\naccuracy, let us mention that in 1913 Lesniewski, later Tarski\u2019s\ndissertation advisor, had already advanced an indexical\nnominalistically inspired solution of the Liar in his paper A\nCritique of the Logical Principle of the Excluded Middle (see\nBetti 2004).\n\nBesides the model-theoretic side, axiomatic investigations of\ntruth and related paradoxes have become increasingly important\nsince the seminal papers of Friedman and Sheard 1987, Feferman 1991.\nSince the year 2000, this research thread has been intensively studied\nwith various aims, from proof-theoretic analysis to\nphilosophical discussion of minimalism (for a survey of the\nvarieties of truth theoretic systems and appropriate references, see\nthe entry on\n axiomatic theories of truth and\n the recent monographs of Halbach 2011, Horsten 2011; see also the\npapers Feferman 2008, Fujimoto 2010, Leigh and Rathjen 2010).\n\nLast but not least, the axiomatic study of epistemic notions has\ngreatly benefited from application of techniques used for proving\nincompleteness and indefinability results since the early sixties:\nthey have yielded negative results (Kaplan and Montague 1960, Montague\n1963, Thomason 1980) and established an interesting link with the\nsurprise test paradox. The situation may have also been changed by the\nstudy of possible world semantics for modal notions, conceived as\npredicates in Halbach, Leitgeb and Welch 2003. However this\nis open to debate and experimentation: for instance it is argued in\nHalbach and Welch 2009 that the predicate approach to necessity is a\nviable route \u2014 insofar as the expressive power is considered\n\u2014 provided one resorts to languages that involve both a\ntruth predicate and the necessity operator.\n",
