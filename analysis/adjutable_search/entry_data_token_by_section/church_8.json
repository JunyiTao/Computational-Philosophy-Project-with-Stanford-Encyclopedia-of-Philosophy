    "main_text": "Philosophy of Logic || Logic and Communication\n2.3 Logic and Communication\n\nWhen one is setting up a logistic system, the well-formed expressions,\naxioms and rules of inference must all be specified\neffectively in order that there can be an effective test of\nwhether a purported proof is really a proof. Intuitively, the\nrequirement is that one can test\u2014by looking at the symbols and\nfollowing a fixed set of instructions for performing concrete\noperations with symbols\u2014whether a given finite sequence of\nsymbols is a wff, or whether a given finite sequence of wffs is a\nproof of the last wff in the sequence. In the absence of such a\nmethod.\n\n\na proof would not necessarily carry conviction, the proposer of a\nproof could fairly be asked to give a proof that it was a\nproof\u2014in short the formal analysis of what constitutes a proof\n(in the sense of a cogent demonstration) would be incomplete (1959\n[BE: 477\u20138]).\n\n\nThe philosophy underlying Church\u2019s position is that mathematical\nproof and logical analysis\u2014as well as other attempts at precise\nreasoning\u2014should be public and communicable.\nJust as one should be able to convince an interlocutor that a\nmathematical proof is really a proof, so one should be able to\nconvince her that an argument more generally is cogent, which will\nalso require convincing her that meaningful assertions have been made.\nFurther, these questions should be addressed by the object\nlanguage in which one is speaking (although one will often have\nto look beyond the language to convince an interlocutor that\none\u2019s assertions are true):\n\n\nBut without the requirements of effectiveness, it might happen that\nsomeone confronted with a proof of a theorem (and admitting the axioms\nand rules of inference) might nevertheless continue to doubt the\ntheorem, because of doubt that the alleged proof actually is a\nproof\u2026. the proposer of the proof might be fairly asked to give\nsupplementary proof that it is a proof\u2014and for the purposes of\ndeductive logic, this supplementary proof ought then to be treated as\npart of the whole proof, and included with it when the process of\nproof is formalized by the logistic method. (1956\u201371 [BE:\n703])\n\n\nFor example, while there may be advantages to using the deduction\ntheorem as a primitive rule of inference, there is also reason to\navoid doing so, i.e., to obviate the need for supplementary proof\n(1956a: \u00a729 and fn. 181).\n\nFor Church, it is constitutive of a language that it provides the\nforegoing connection between reasoning and communication:\n\n\nFor, however indefinite or imprecisely fixed the common idea of a\nlanguage may be, it is at least fundamental to it that a language\nshall serve the purpose of communication. And to the extent that\nrequirements of effectiveness fail, the purpose of communication is\ndefeated. (1956a: \u00a707)\n\nTo say that an assertion has been made if there is a meaning evades\nthe issue unless an effective criterion is provided for the presence\nof meaning. An understanding of the language, however reached, must\ninclude effective ability to recognize meaningfulness (in some\nappropriate sense), and in the purely formal aspect of the language,\nthe logistic system, this appears as an effective criterion of\nwell-formedness. (1956a: fn. 120)\n\n\nIn short, an assertion can be recognized as meaningful only if there\nis an effective method for determining whether it is meaningful;\nChurch\u2019s logistic method provides such a method by way of\nwell-formedness. Further, since communication and conviction are at\nissue (as well as mere judgments of meaningfulness), one must also be\nable to tell which propositions have been asserted and, in\nparticular, which ones have been proved.\n\nHowever, some critics have questioned the cogency of Church\u2019s\nphilosophical arguments for his requirement of effectiveness (Anderson\n1998). Moreover, it should be noted that logical consequence is not in\ngeneral an effective notion. By Church\u2019s Theorem (1936a), there\nis no effective test for deciding the validity or provability of the\nwffs of first order logic or of logics of any higher order (as Church\nhimself notes; 1956\u201371 [BE: 703]). Further, as Church was\nacutely aware, there is a price to be paid for communicating and\nverifying proofs in a formalized language that meets the requirement\nof effectiveness. If the formalized language is sufficiently\nexpressive, it will be subject to G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness\ntheorems (see\n \u00a75.4).\n\nIt should also be noted that the question what exactly is an effective\nprocedure spurred Church\u2019s work on effective calculability and\nthe decision problem (see\n section 1).\n It is also motivated some of his other technical work such as his\nwork on constructive ordinals (1938).\n\nIn addition to the requirement of effectiveness, Church also demands\nthat proofs should be constructive. However, in later years his\nattitude became more ecumenical. See (1936b: fn. 10 added 1971 [BE:\n128]).\n",
