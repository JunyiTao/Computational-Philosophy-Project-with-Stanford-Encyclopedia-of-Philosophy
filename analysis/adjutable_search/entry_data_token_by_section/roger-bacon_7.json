    "main_text": "Bacon as an Aristotelian Commentator || Bacon on Universals and Individuation\n4.4 Bacon on Universals and Individuation\n\nBacon has two distinct treatments of universals and individuation: his\nearly works (1240s) and later in the Communia naturalium\n(1260s-70s). \n\nIn the works from the 1240s, Bacon distinguishes the real\nuniversal from the mental universal. Hence, the\nuniversal as the ultimate basis of predication is not the species as\nmental intention. Universals in the primary sense as the basis of\nscientific objectivity are extra-mental. Bacon\u2019s presentation of\nthis issue is complex. Certainly, he is not a complete Platonist in\nregard to universals. To the objection that since form is individuated\nthrough its matter and whatever exists in things must exist in matter\nas individuated, but the universal is not such a thing, he replies\nthat a universal is either in the mind or in things; if it is not in\nthe former, it has to be in the latter. A universal arises from common\nmatter and common form and so has no need of being immediately\nindividuated: \u201cAnd because the common matter and common form\nexist along with the proper matter and form of individuals, the\nuniversal is present in this way in singulars\u201d ([OHI, X]\n242\u2013243 = TTUM, 36). Hence, one cannot split apart the common\nmatter from the particular matter or the common form from the\nparticular form of a particular individual.\n\nIn one question, Bacon rejects the view that universals are\nconstituted only by the mind. He holds that the universal in and of\nitself is prior to the knowledge process: \u201cThis follows because\na universal is nothing other than a nature in which singulars of the\nsame (nature) agree; but particulars agree in this manner in a common\nnature predicable of them, without any act of the mind\u201d ([OHI,\nX], 242\u2013243 = TTUM, 36). This sounds Platonic, but in fact for\nBacon there are no Platonic universals in a separate world; rather,\nreal universals do exist, but they are found only in and with\nindividual things. There is a mutual interpenetration of common form\nand matter and proper form and matter such that there is just one\nindividual, and so the common nature is realized in this or that\nindividual. Bacon\u2019s answer to the possibility of a universal\nbeing present in a singular is stated as follows:\n\n\nOnly three kinds of being are imaginable: either [being] in and of\nitself, [being] in the mind, or [being] in things, but a universal is\nnot something that has being in and of itself and stands on its own,\nbecause then it would be a Platonic idea; neither [does it have being]\nin the mind, as we have seen\u2026 Again, a universal is a common\nnature in which particulars agree; but Socrates and Plato and [others]\nof this sort cannot agree in a common nature which is in them unless\nthe nature [be] in some way duplicated in them, because a universal is\nnothing other than a common nature extended into particulars and\nexisting in them as duplicated, in which all things truly exist. And\nthus, without them [the particulars] there can be no\nuniversals\u2026. ([OHI, VII, 243\u2013244 = TTUM, 37)\n\n\nFor Bacon, there are two kinds of particular, the determinate here and\nnow particular and the indeterminate particular.\n\nBacon treats the problem of individuation both in the early Parisian\nlectures and the later Communia naturalium. This has given\nrise to the issue of Bacon\u2019s realism or his proto-nominalism.\nItis addressed in the next section.\n",
