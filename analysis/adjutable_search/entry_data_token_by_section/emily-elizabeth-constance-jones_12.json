    "main_text": "The Dualism of Practical Reason\n8. Women in Early Analytic Philosophy\n\nJones was not the only woman approaching philosophical logic and\nethics from a broadly analytic perspective during this period:\nPeirce\u2019s student, Christine Ladd-Franklin (1847\u20131930), made\nsignificant contributions to logic and psychology (see Russinoff 1999\nfor Ladd-Franklin\u2019s contributions to the algebra of logic), and\nthe writings of Lady Victoria Welby (1837\u20131912) on meaning were\nwidely read. Indeed, Peirce wrote a joint review of her What is\nMeaning? and Russell\u2019s Principles of Mathematics\nfor The Nation. (Dale 1996 discusses Welby\u2019s role in\nthe development of the theory of meaning.) Later figures include the\nphilosopher of science, Dorothy Wrinch (1894\u20131976), a Girton\nstudent who went on to study under Russell, and Susanne Langer\n(1895\u20131985), who wrote a dissertation under Alfred North\nWhitehead at Radcliff in 1926. Wrinch, who published papers in\nMind on, among other things, the unity of the proposition and\nthe theory of relativity, later abandoned philosophy for chemistry,\nteaching for many years at Smith College. Langer, who would achieve\nprominence in the philosophy of art beginning in the 1940s, published\nseveral technical articles on type theory and related topics early in\nher career (Langer 1926, 1927; McDaniel 2017 is a useful guide to her\nearly work). Possibly the most prominent woman analytic philosopher of\nthe first half of the twentieth century, however, was another Girton\nstudent,\n L. Susan Stebbing\n (1885\u20131943), Professor of Philosophy at Bedford College,\nLondon, and co-founder of the journal Analysis. Stebbing,\nthrough her most successful student, Max Black, is responsible for one\nof the largest \u201cfamilies\u201d in Josh Dever\u2019s Philosophy\nFamily Tree (see Other Internet Resources).\n\nWaithe (1995) is an important resource for research into these women,\nas well as numerous minor figures; see also van der Schaar and\nSchliesser (2017). On the larger question of the erasure of women from\nthe history of philosophy, from antiquity to the French Revolution,\nEileen O\u2019Neill\u2019s essay, \u201cDisappearing Ink\u201d\n(O\u2019Neill 1998), remains indispensable.\n",
