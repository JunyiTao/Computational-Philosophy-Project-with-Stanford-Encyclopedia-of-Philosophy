    "main_text": "Deductive and Inductive Consequence\n1. Deductive and Inductive Consequence\n\nSome arguments are such that the (joint) truth of the premises is\nnecessarily sufficient for the truth of the conclusions. In\nthe sense of logical consequence central to the current\ntradition, such \u201cnecessary sufficiency\u201d distinguishes\ndeductive validity from inductive validity. In inductively\nvalid arguments, the (joint) truth of the premises is very likely\n(but not necessarily) sufficient for the truth of the conclusion.\nAn inductively valid argument is such that, as it is often put, its\npremises make its conclusion more likely or more reasonable (even\nthough the conclusion may well be untrue given the joint truth of the\npremises). The argument\n\nAll swans observed so far have been white.\n\nSmoothy is a swan.\n\nTherefore, Smoothy is white.\n\n\nis not deductively valid because the premises are not necessarily\nsufficient for the conclusion. Smoothy may well be a black swan.\n\nDistinctions can be drawn between different inductive arguments. Some\ninductive arguments seem quite reasonable, and others are less so.\nThere are many different ways to attempt to analyse inductive\nconsequence. We might consider the degree to which the premises make\nthe conclusion more likely (a probabilistic reading), or we\nmight check whether the most normal circumstances in which\nthe premises are true render the conclusion true as well. (This leads\nto some kinds of default or non-monotonic inference.) The field of\ninductive consequence is difficult and important, but we shall leave\nthat topic here and focus on deductive validity.\n\n(See the entries on\n inductive logic\n and\n non-monotonic logic\n for more information on these topics.)\n\nThe constraint of necessity is not sufficient to settle the\nnotion of deductive validity, for the notion of necessity may\nalso be fleshed out in a number of ways. To say that a conclusion\nnecessarily follows from the premises is to say that the argument is\nsomehow exceptionless, but there are many different ways to\nmake that idea precise.\n\nA first stab at the notion might use what we now call metaphysical\nnecessity. Perhaps an argument is valid if it is (metaphysically)\nimpossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion to be\nuntrue, valid if\u2014holding fixed the interpretations of premises\nand conclusion\u2014in every possible world in which the premises\nhold, so does the conclusion. This constraint is plausibly thought to\nbe a necessary condition for logical consequence (if it could\nbe that the premises are true and the conclusion isn\u2019t,\nthen there is no doubt that the conclusion does not follow from the\npremises); however, on most accounts of logical consequence, it is not\na sufficient condition for validity. Many admit the existence of a\nposteriori necessities, such as the claim that water is\nH\\(_2\\)O. If that claim is necessary, then the argument:\n\n\\(x\\) is water.\n\nTherefore, \\(x\\) is H\\(_2\\)O.\n\n\nis necessarily truth preserving, but it seems a long way from being\ndeductively valid. It was a genuine discovery that water is\nH\\(_2\\)O, one that required significant empirical investigation.\nWhile there may be genuine discoveries of valid arguments that we had\nnot previously recognised as such, it is another thing entirely to\nthink that these discoveries require empirical investigation.\n\nAn alternative line on the requisite sort of necessity turns\nto conceptual necessity. On this line, the conclusion of (3)\nis not a consequence of its premise given that it is not a conceptual\ntruth that water is H\\(_2\\)O. The concept water and the\nconcept \\(H_2O\\) happen to pick out the same property,\nbut this agreement is determined partially by the world.\n\nA similar picture of logic takes consequence to be a matter of what is\nanalytically true, and it is not an analytic truth that water\nis H\\(_2\\)O. The word \u201cwater\u201d and the formula\n\u201cH\\(_2\\)O\u201d agree in extension (and necessarily so)\nbut they do not agree in meaning.\n\nIf metaphysical necessity is too coarse a notion to determine logical\nconsequence (since it may be taken to render too many arguments\ndeductively valid), an appeal to conceptual or analytic necessity\nmight seem to be a better route. The trouble, as Quine argued, is that\nthe distinction between analytic and synthetic (and similarly,\nconceptual and non-conceptual) truths is not as straightforward as we\nmight have thought in the beginning of the 20th Century. (See the\nentry on the\n analytic/synthetic distinction.)\n Furthermore many arguments seem to be truth-preserving on the basis\nof analysis alone:\n\nPeter is Greg\u2019s mother\u2019s brother\u2019s son.\n\nTherefore, Peter is Greg\u2019s cousin.\n\n\nOne can understand that the conclusion follows from the premises, on\nthe basis of one\u2019s understanding of the concepts involved. One\nneed not know anything about the identity of Peter, Greg\u2019s\ncousin. Still, many have thought that (4) is not deductively valid,\ndespite its credentials as truth-preserving on analytic or conceptual\ngrounds. It is not quite as general as it could be because it is not\nas formal as it could be. The argument succeeds only because\nof the particular details of family concepts involved.\n\nA further possibility for carving out the distinctive notion of\nnecessity grounding logical consequence is the notion of\napriority. Deductively valid arguments, whatever they are,\ncan be known to be so without recourse to experience, so they must be\nknowable a priori. A constraint of apriority certainly seems\nto rule argument (3) out as deductively valid, and rightly so.\nHowever, it will not do to rule out argument (4). If we take arguments\nlike (4) to turn not on matters of deductive validity but something\nelse, such as an a priori knowable definition, then we must\nlook elsewhere for a characterisation of logical consequence.\n",
