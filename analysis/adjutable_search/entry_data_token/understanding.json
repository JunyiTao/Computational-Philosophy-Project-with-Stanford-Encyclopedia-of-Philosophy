Contexts\n\nThe concept of understanding has been sometimes prominent, sometimes\nneglected, and sometimes viewed with suspicion, across a number of\ndifferent areas of philosophy (for a partial overview, see Zagzebski\n2001). This section traces some of that background, beginning with the\nplace of understanding in Ancient Greek philosophy. It then considers\nhow the topic of understanding was lost and then\n\u201crecovered\u201d in contemporary discussions in epistemology\nand the philosophy of science.\n1.1 Ancient Philosophy\n\nThe ancient Greek word episteme is at the root of our\ncontemporary word \u201cepistemology\u201d, and among philosophers\nit has been common to translate episteme simply as\n\u201cknowledge\u201d (see, e.g., Parry 2003 [2020]).\n\nFor the last several decades, however, a case has been made that\n\u201cunderstanding\u201d is a better translation of\nepisteme. (For early influential arguments see, e.g.,\nMoravscik 1979; Burnyeat 1980, 1981; Annas 1981.) To appreciate why,\nnote that knowledge, as now commonly conceived, can apparently be\nquite easy to get. Thus it seems I can know a proposition such as\nthat it is raining outside just by opening my eyes. It also\nseems that items of knowledge can be in principle isolated or\natomistic. I can therefore apparently know that it is raining while\nknowing very little about other things, such as why it is raining, or\nwhat constitutes rain, or when it will stop.\n\nUnderstanding seems to be different than knowledge in both respects.\nFor one thing, understanding typically seems harder to acquire, and\nmore of an epistemic accomplishment, than knowledge (Pritchard 2010).\nFor another, the objects of understanding seem more structured and\ninterconnected (Zagzebski 2019). Thus the subject matters we try to\nunderstand are often highly complex (quantum mechanics, the U.S. Civil\nWar), and even when we try to understand isolated events (such as the\nspilling of my coffee cup), we typically do so by drawing connections\nwith other events (such as the jostling of the table by my knee).\n\nWith contrasts such as these in mind, it has seemed to several\nscholars of Ancient philosophy that episteme has more in\ncommon with what we would now call \u201cunderstanding\u201d than\nwhat we would now call \u201cknowledge\u201d. Thus Julia Annas notes\nthat, for Plato, the person with episteme has a\nsystematic understanding of things, and is not a mere\npossessor of various truths (Annas 1981: ch. 10). Jonathan Lear\nsimilarly claims that for Aristotle,\n\n\nTo have episteme one must not only know a thing, one must\nalso grasp its cause or explanation. This is to understand it: to know\nin a deep sense what it is and how it has come to be. (Lear 1988:\n6)\n\n\nGranted, what Greek philosophers had in mind by episteme\noften does not fully align with our contemporary ideas about\nunderstanding, because in the hands of philosophers such as Plato and\nAristotle episteme is an exceptionally high-grade epistemic\naccomplishment. For Plato, full episteme seems to require a\ngrasp of the basic elements of reality\u2014in its most complete\nform, a grasp that traces back to the Form of the Good itself (Schwab\n2016, 2020; Moss 2020). For Aristotle, it seems to require an\nappreciation of the deductive relationships that allegedly hold\nbetween natures or first principles and observable phenomena (Burnyeat\n1981). In our contemporary use, by contrast, we often happily ascribe\nunderstanding to quite low-grade cases, where forms or first\nprinciples do not seem to be grasped or even relevant\u2014as when we\ntake ourselves to understand why the coffee cup spilled. Still, with\nits stress on systematicity and interconnectedness, episteme\nplausibly has more in common with our contemporary concept\nunderstanding than our contemporary concept\nknowledge.\n\nIf an understanding-like state was of fundamental epistemic importance\nto the Greeks, it is interesting to ask why the focus of epistemology\nshifted over time, and why an interest in knowledge, especially\npropositional knowledge, came to predominate\u2014including and maybe\nespecially quite isolated bits of propositional knowledge, such as\nthat I am sitting in front of a fire, or that I have two\nhands.\n\nPerhaps the shift occurred in response to the rise of scepticism in\nHellenistic philosophy (Burnyeat 1980: 188; cf. Zagzebski 2001: 236).\nOr perhaps the modern focus on propositional knowledge was a response\nto the wars of religion in sixteenth and seventeenth century Europe,\nwhere it became increasingly important to distinguish good knowledge\nclaims from bad, even with respect to quite isolated claims. (For more\non the modern rise of interest in propositional knowledge, see Pasnau\n2010; 2017.) Regardless of why the shift occurred, a desire to grasp\n\u201chow things hang together\u201d undoubtedly remained a part of\nthe human condition. It is therefore unsurprising that a move to\nrevive understanding as a topic of philosophical inquiry eventually\nemerged.\n1.2 Epistemology & Philosophy of Science\n\nAlthough understanding as an epistemic good was largely neglected by\nmodern epistemologists in favor of theorizing about knowledge (or\nrelated epistemic properties, such as justification and rationality),\nit reappeared as a central object of concern at the end of the\ntwentieth century, for a few different reasons.\n\nCatherine Elgin, for one, influentially argued that we cannot make\nsense of some of our greatest intellectual accomplishments, especially\nthe accomplishments we associate with science and art, without\nappreciating the way they are often oriented not towards knowledge,\nbut rather understanding (see especially Elgin 1991, 1996). From the\nperspective of virtue epistemology, Linda Zagzebski claimed that if we\nthink of an intellectual virtue as an \u201cexcellence of the\nmind\u201d, attuned to a variety of epistemic goods, then there is\nsomething one-sided about focusing attention only on the good of\nknowledge, while neglecting other highly prized goods such as\nunderstanding and wisdom (see especially Zagzebski 1996: 43\u201350;\n2001). Finally, Jonathan Kvanvig forcefully argued that while\nunderstanding is distinctively valuable from an epistemic point of\nview\u2014i.e., more valuable than any of its proper parts, such as\ntruth, or justification, or a combination of the two\u2014knowledge\nis not (Kvanvig 2003). For all these thinkers, the spotlight of\nconcern within epistemology needed to be broadened so that goods such\nas understanding could be given their proper due, and their claims\nresonated with other epistemologists (for overviews, see Gordon 2017;\nHannon forthcoming).\n\nWhile the notion of understanding was often simply neglected in\nepistemology, in the philosophy of science it was for many years\nactively downplayed. A primary figure in this dynamic was Carl Hempel\n(see especially Hempel 1965). Although Hempel helped bring the notion\nof explanation back into respectability in the philosophy of science,\nhe had significant reservations about tying explanation too closely to\nthe notion of understanding.\n\nPart of this seemed to stem from the fact that the idea of\nunderstanding that prevailed in his day was highly subjective and\npsychological\u2014it emphasized more a subjective\n\u201csense\u201d of understanding, often tied to a felt sense of\nfamiliarity. As Hempel notes, however, poor explanations might excel\nalong this dimension because they might\n\n\ngive the questioner a sense of having attained some understanding;\nthey may resolve his perplexity and in this sense \u201canswer\u201d\nhis question.\n\n\n\u201cBut\u201d, he continues,\n\n\nhowever satisfactory these answers may be psychologically, they are\nnot adequate for the purposes of science, which, after all, is\nconcerned to develop a conception of the world that has a clear,\nlogical bearing on our experience and is thus capable of objective\ntest. (Hempel 1966: 47\u201348)\n\n\nThe goodness of an explanation therefore seems to have little obvious\nconnection to whether it manages to generate understanding in a\nparticular audience. A good explanation might do that. But then again,\nit might not. Patently poor explanations are also able to generate a\nrich \u201csense\u201d of understanding in some audiences (think of\nconspiracy theorists), despite their shortcomings.\n\nPhilosophers such as Michael Friedman responded to Hempel\u2019s\nconcerns by noting that simply because there seems to be a\npsychological element to understanding it does not follow that\nunderstanding is merely subjective or up for grabs (Friedman 1974).\nAfter all, knowledge has a psychological element, in light of the\nbelief condition, but few hold that knowledge is merely subjective or\nup for grabs. Others, such as Jaegwon Kim, argued that leaving\nconsiderations about understanding out of accounts of explanation was\ndeeply mistaken (Kim 1994 [2010]). After all, Kim claimed, we desire\nto explain things because we want to understand them.\n\nDespite the efforts of Friedman, Kim, and others, significant\nreservations about the notion of understanding continued to linger in\nthe philosophy of science (see, for example, Trout 2002). A notable\nshift occurred with Henk de Regt\u2019s distinction between the\n\u201cfeeling\u201d or phenomenology of understanding and genuine\nunderstanding (de Regt 2004, 2009: ch. 1; cf. de Regt and Dieks 2005).\nIn particular, he argued that the feeling is neither necessary nor\nsufficient for genuine understanding. De Regt\u2019s important\ndistinction helped pave the way for a new surge of work on the topic\nover the last two decades, and helped philosophers move beyond\nthinking of understanding mainly in terms of felt\n\u201caha!\u201d or \u201ceureka!\u201d\nexperiences.\n2. Theoretical Frameworks\n\nAs we look to particular accounts of understanding, it will help to\nconsider in turn:\n\nunderstanding\u2019s distinctive object (or objects),\nits distinctive psychology, and\nthe distinctive sort of normative relationship that needs to hold\nbetween the psychology of the person who understands and the object of\nhis or her understanding.\n\n\nBy way of comparison, consider the traditional \u201cjustified true\nbelief\u201d analysis of knowledge. On this view, knowledge involves\na distinctive object (roughly, the truth, or a true proposition), a\ndistinctive psychology (the psychological act of belief or assent),\nand a distinctive normative relationship that needs to hold between\nthe psychology of the believer and the thing believed (namely, that\none\u2019s belief in the true proposition needs to be justified, in\nsome sense).\n\nWhat can be said, in a parallel way, about the elements of\nunderstanding?\n2.1 Objects of Understanding\n\nAt least at first glance, the objects of understanding appear to be so\nvaried that it is not obvious where one might find a common thread.\nThus, we can understand fields of study, particular states of affairs,\ninstitutions, other people, and on and on (cf. Elgin\n1996: 123).\n\nIn line with the discussion in Ancient philosophy, and setting aside\nfor the moment special issues related to understanding other people\n(see Section 5), let us start with the generic view that the objects\nof understanding are something like \u201cconnections\u201d or\n\u201crelations\u201d. Following a distinction from Kim (1994\n[2010]), we can contrast two ways of thinking about these connections\nand relations\u2014i.e., these plausible objects of\nunderstanding.\n\nAccording to explanatory internalism, the connections or\nexplanatory relations one grasps are \u201clogico-linguistic\u201d\nrelations that hold among a person\u2019s beliefs or attitudes, or\nmore exactly the contents of those beliefs or attitudes (Kim 1994\n[2010]). What we grasp or see, when we understand some\nphenomenon, are how these various contents are logically or\nsemantically related to one another.\n\nKim argues that Hempel is a paradigm example of an explanatory\ninternalist (Kim 1994 [2010]; cf. 1999 [2010]). For instance, suppose\nthat one wants to explain and hence understand why a particular bar of\nmetal began to rust (McCain 2016: ch. 9). A good Hempelian explanation\nwould be one in which a sentence describing the rusting follows\ninferentially from (a) a statement of the initial conditions (the\nmoisture in the air, the constitution of the bar) and (b) a further\nlaw-like statement connecting the moisture, the constitution of the\nbar, and the onset of rust.\n\nThis Hempelian framework seems internalist because what you see or\ngrasp, when you understand the phenomenon, are connections among the\npropositions you accept\u2014more exactly, you see or grasp different\ninferential or probabilistic connections among the contents of your\nbeliefs that bear on the rusting. As Kim puts it:\n\n\nthe basic relation that generates an explanatory relation is a\nlogico-linguistic one that connects descriptions of events, and the\njob of formulating an explanation consists, it seems, in merely\nre-arranging appropriate items in the body of propositions that\nconstitute our total knowledge at a time. In explaining something,\nthen, all action takes place within the epistemic system, on\nthe subjective side of the divide between knowledge and the reality\nknown, or between representation and the world represented. (Kim 1994\n[2010: 171\u2013172])\n\n\nAn explanatory externalist by comparison holds that the basic\nconnections or relationship one grasps, when one understands, are not\nlogico-linguistic but metaphysical. What you grasp, when you\nunderstand why the metal began to rust, are not primarily\nrelationships among your beliefs or their contents. Rather, you\nprimarily grasp real, mind-independent relationships that obtain in\nthe world.\n\nTheorists who hold that the objects of understanding are\ninternal\u2014i.e., logico-linguistic relations, the grasp of which\nyields understanding\u2014vary somewhat about which relations count.\nAlthough it seems clear in Hempel that the objects are inferential\nrelationships of deductive and inductive support, epistemologists\noften appeal in a general way to relations of coherence. Thus\nCarter and Gordon write:\n\n\nWe think it is clear that objectual understanding\u2014for\nexample, as one attains when one grasps the relevant coherence-making\nrelations between propositions comprising some subject matter\u2014is\na particularly valuable epistemic good\u2026 Understanding wider\nsubject matters will tend to be more cognitively demanding than\nunderstanding narrow subject matters because more\npropositions must be believed and their relations grasped. (Carter\n& Gordon 2014: 7\u20138)\n\n\nKvanvig likewise points to the importance of coherence:\n\n\nCentral to the notion of understanding are various coherence-like\nelements: to have understanding is to grasp explanatory and conceptual\nconnections between various pieces of information involved in the\nsubject matter in question. Such language involves a subjective\nelement (the grasping or seeing of the connections in question) and a\nmore objective, epistemic element. The more objective, epistemic\nelement is precisely the kind of element identified by coherentists as\ncentral to the notion of epistemic justification or rationality, as\nclarified, in particular, by Lehrer (1974), BonJour (1985) and Lycan\n(1988). (Kvanvig 2018: 699)\n\n\nOther epistemologists similarly point to coherence relations as the\nobjects of understanding (e.g., Riggs 2003: 192). Since\n\u201ccoherence\u201d is presumably a relation that holds among the\ncontents of beliefs, and not among items out there in the world, these\nviews would qualify as internalist accounts of the objects of\nunderstanding, according to the Kimean framework. (For further\nexamples and criticism, see Khalifa 2017a.)\n\nFor externalists about the object of understanding, especially\nconcerning phenomena \u201cout there in the world\u201d, the\nproposed objects vary. For instance, there is some support for the\nidea that the objects are nomic relations, or relationships\naccording to which individual events and other phenomena are explained\nby laws, and upper-level laws are explained by lower-level or more\nfundamental laws (Railton 1978). Another view is that the objects are\ncausal relations (Salmon 1984; Lipton 1991 [2004]), or more\ngenerally dependence relations (Kim 1974, 1994; Grimm 2014,\n2017; Greco 2014; Dells\u00e9n 2020), where causation is usually\ntaken to be just one species of dependence.\n\nA variation on the \u201cdependence relationships\u201d idea is that\nthe objects of understanding are \u201cpossibility spaces\u201d (cf.\nle Bihan 2017). Indeed, on the plausible assumption that dependence is\nan essentially modal notion\u2014that is, fundamentally tied to ideas\nof possibility and necessity\u2014dependence relations ineliminably\ngive rise to or generate possibility spaces. This is in keeping with a\nsuggestion by Robert Nozick that\n\n\nexplanation locates something in actuality, showing its actual\nconnections with other things, while understanding locates it\nin a network of possibility, showing the connections it would have to\nother nonactual things or processes. (Nozick 1981: 12; cf. Grimm\n2008)\n\n\nNote that the distinction between internal and external explanation\nrelations is related to, but cross-cuts, another influential\ndistinction by Wesley Salmon, between ontic and epistemic accounts of\nexplanation (Salmon 1989; for discussion see Bechtel & Abrahamsen\n2005 and Craver 2014). Salmon\u2019s distinction has come in for\ncriticism (see, e.g., Illari 2013; Bokulich 2016, 2018), because among\nother things it is not clear why epistemic accounts should not be\nontic or world-involving; knowledge is an epistemic concept, after\nall, but it is ontic or world-involving in virtue of the truth\ncondition. The distinction between explanatory internalism and\nexternalism plausibly avoids this concern.\n\nSuppose in any case that the objects of understanding\u2014the\nconnections or relations we grasp when we understand\u2014are out\nthere in the world, and are not simply logico-linguistic items or\nelements of our psychology. According to a further important\ndistinction from John Greco (2014), it does not follow that these\nlogico-linguistic/psychological items\u2014or more generally these\nmental representations\u2014do not play a crucial role in\nour coming to understand, because the representations typically play\nthe role of vehicles of understanding, even if they are not\nthemselves understanding\u2019s object. More generally, Greco notes,\nit is important to distinguish between the object of\nunderstanding vs. the vehicle of understanding, i.e.,\n\u201cbetween the thing understood and its\nrepresentation\u201d (Greco 2014: 293).\n\nThus consider that a good map\u2014say, of Midtown Manhattan\u2014is\ntypically a vehicle of understanding rather than an object of\nunderstanding. When it is accurate, it allows the mind to grasp how\nthe streets and landmarks of Midtown are laid out, and to appreciate\nthe relationships they bear to one another. Or again, typically when\nyou take a look at your car\u2019s gas gauge and form the belief that\nthe tank is half empty, the gauge is the vehicle by which you\nform your belief about the gas, but it is not the object of\nyour belief (see Dretske 1981). Assuming that the gauge is functioning\nproperly, the object of your belief is the gas itself, while the gauge\nis simply the vehicle that represents the state of the gas to you.\n\n(Of course, either the map or the gauge could become an\nobject of understanding\u2014one could think about how the streets\nand landmarks are represented, e.g., the different colors or shapes or\nfonts the map uses to represent Midtown, or the length of the\ngauge\u2014but this would be to \u201cinvolve a representation of a\nrepresentation\u201d (Greco 2014: 293). And while the mind is capable\nof such an act, it represents an element of abstraction, and plausibly\na departure from our usual way of engaging with the world.)\n\nThis distinction between objects and vehicles of understanding leaves\nopen the possibility that mental representations might not be the only\nvehicles of understanding, or the only way of latching on to real\nrelations in the world. Perhaps a person might come to understand the\nworld by first manually manipulating it, thus noting the possibilities\nthat it affords and how its different elements are connected (cf.\nLipton 2009; Kuorikoski and Ylikoski 2015). This would be a way to\n\u201cdirectly\u201d grasp causal structure, a structure that could\nthen\u2014cognitively downstream, as it were\u2014be represented by\nthe mind, perhaps in the form of mental maps, or \u201cdependence\nmaps\u201d (see Section 2.2).\n\nAppreciating the contrast between vehicle of understanding and object\nof understanding helps to reveal that in addition to pure internalist\nviews about the object of understanding (where the objects of\nunderstanding are logico-linguistic relations), and pure externalist\nviews (where the objects are worldly), there are also possible hybrid\nviews.\n\nFor instance, on the sort of view we find in Michael Strevens\u2019s\nDepth (2008), what we grasp in the first instance are\nrelations that hold among the contents of our beliefs: relations of\ndeductive entailment or coherence or probabilistic support. This view\nis not simply internalist, however, because grasping these\nlogico-linguistic relationships, and in particular the relationships\nof deductive entailment, \u201cmirror\u201d the real relationships\nthat obtain in the world, and thus provide a vehicle for apprehending\nthose relationships (Strevens 2008: 72). Thus Strevens holds that his\ntheory is able to:\n\n\nshow how a deductive argument, or similar formal structure, can\nrepresent causal influence\u2026. When a deductive argument is of\nthe right sort to represent a causal process that has as a consequence\nthe state of affairs asserted to hold by the argument\u2019s\nconclusion, I say that the argument causally entails the\nconclusion. A derivation that causally entails its conclusion, then,\nis one that can be used to represent (whether truly or not) a causal\nprocess that has the concluding state of affairs as its consequence.\n(Strevens 2012: 449)\n\n\nOn this view, by grasping or appreciating the necessitating force of\nan entailment relation one thereby grasps or appreciates the\nnecessitating force of a causal relation\u2014or, at least, something\nimportantly like it.\n\nAccording to another hybrid approach, the internal logical or\nprobabilistic relationships do not mirror the relationships\nout there in the world, but rather provide evidence for the\nexistence of relationships out there in the world. Thus some hold that\nwhen things go well an appreciation or grasp of the probabilistic\nconnections among the various things we believe allows us to infer the\nexistence of real causal connections in the world (see\nSpirtes, Glymour, & Scheines 1993; Pearl 2000 [2009]). As\nWesley Salmon characterizes an earlier version of this idea,\n\n\nThe explanatory significance of statistical relations is indirect.\nTheir fundamental import lies in the fact\u2026 that they constitute\nevidence for causal relations. (Salmon 1984: 192)\n\n\nBearing in mind earlier distinctions, these would be accounts on which\none\u2019s appreciation of statistical relations is the vehicle\nthrough which one grasps real (external) causal relations in the\nworld.\n2.2 Psychology of Understanding\n\nWith respect to the psychology of understanding, recall that the\npsychological element of propositional knowledge is typically\nconstrued in terms of belief, where belief is taken to be a\nkind of assent or saying \u201cYes\u201d to the content of the\nproposition. Thus to believe that the sky is blue is to assent to the\nproposition that the sky is blue; it is \u201ctaking it to\nbe true\u201d that the sky is blue.\n\nWhen we turn to understanding, by contrast, some have claimed that a\nnew suite of cognitive abilities comes onto the scene, abilities that\nwe did not find in ordinary cases of propositional knowledge. In\nparticular, some philosophers claim that the kind of mental action\nverbs that naturally come to the fore when we think about\nunderstanding\u2014\u201cgrasping\u201d and \u201cseeing\u201d,\nfor example\u2014evoke mental abilities \u201cbeyond belief\u201d,\ni.e., beyond simple assent or taking-to-be-true (for an overview, see\nBaumberger, Beisbart, & Brun 2017).\n\nFor instance, Elgin, de Regt, and Wilkenfeld argue that those who\ngrasp how things are connected are able to cognitively\n\u201cdo\u201d things that others cannot\u2014they can apply their\nunderstanding to new cases, for example, and draw new inferences.\n(See, for example, Elgin 1996: 122\u201324; de Regt 2004, 2017;\nWilkenfeld 2013). Thus car mechanics who understand how engines work\nare able to make sense of engines that they have not encountered\nbefore, and to anticipate how changes in one part of the engine will\ntypically lead (or fail to lead) to changes in other parts.\n\nGrimm claims that the distinctive nature of these abilities flows from\nthe distinctive nature of the objects of understanding (Grimm 2017).\nSuppose that the connections or relations one grasps are complex\nenough to constitute what we might call\n\u201cstructures\u201d\u2014structures with parts that depend upon\none another in various ways. Arguably, for the mind to take up these\nstructures in the right way, it is not enough simply to assent to\ntheir existence. Rather, one needs to appreciate how the structure\n\u201cworks\u201d, or how changes in its various parts will lead, or\nfail to lead, to changes in other parts.\n\nFor instance, suppose the structures to be grasped are represented by\n\u201ccausal maps\u201d or \u201cdependence maps\u201d\u2014maps\nwith nodes representing variables that can take on different values\nand thus represent directions of dependence (Gopnik & Glymour\n2002; Gopnik et al. 2004). In the schematic image below, from Gopnik\net al. (2004), the map represents a system in which changes to the\nvalue of Z bring about changes to the value of S,\nchanges to the value of S bring about changes to the values of\nX and R, and so on.\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Grimm (2017), a striking feature of these maps is that\nthey are, as it were, \u201cmobile\u201d maps. That is, they are\ncognitive representations that by their very nature can adapt and\nchange as the variables represented by the map take on different\nvalues. Put another way, they are \u201cunsaturated\u201d maps, in\nthe sense that they are characterized in terms of unsaturated\nvariables that can become saturated by taking on different\nvalues. What this means in terms of cognitive uptake is important,\nGrimm argues, because if the maps are mobile or unsaturated in this\nway, then the mind that aptly takes them up must itself be mobile. In\nparticular, the mind that takes up causal maps in a way that yields\nunderstanding must be able to anticipate how varying or adjusting the\nvalue of one of the variables will lead (or fail to lead) to changes\nin the values of the other variables (cf. Woodward 2003).\n\nRelatedly, Alison Hills characterizes the distinctive psychological\nabilities that undergird understanding in terms of \u201ccognitive\ncontrol\u201d (Hills 2016). For example, Hills claims that in order\nto understand why it is right to give money to charity, it is not\nenough to simply believe the proposition that it is right to give\nmoney to charity because we owe assistance to the very needy\n(Hills 2016: 669), because I could accept a \u201cbecause\u201d\nclaim along these lines on the basis of testimony while having only a\nvery dim sense of how the two ingredient claims (that it is right to\ngive money and we owe assistance to the very needy) are related. What\nis needed in addition is an appreciation of the relationship between\nthese two claims. And what this involves, according to the cognitive\ncontrol view, is an ability to \u201cmanipulate\u201d the things\nstanding in relationship: for example, to be able to make a variety of\ninferences in light of the relationship (Hills 2016: 663).\n\nAlthough the views we have considered so far agree in thinking that\nthere is \u201csomething special\u201d from a psychological point of\nview about understanding, other accounts claim that there is nothing\nparticularly special about understanding\u2019s psychological\nprofile. More exactly, it is said that understanding does not appeal\nto any special abilities or capacities that we do not find in ordinary\ncases of knowledge.\n\nEmily Sullivan, for instance, claims that even if we grant that\nunderstanding involves abilities, it does not follow that there is\nsomething special about understanding from a psychological point of\nview, because ordinary propositional knowledge itself requires\nabilities (Sullivan 2018). Thus I can apparently only know that the\ntraffic light is red, in the actual world, if I would have gotten the\ncolor right in close possible worlds as well. More generally, knowing\nseems to require the ability to track the truth about the world, so\nthat when the world changes, my cognitive attitude about the world\nchanges with it. But this ability to be responsive to changing\nconditions is not obviously anything exotic, and it does seem to\nentail that the object of the mind is not a proposition (that the\ntraffic light is red seems like a paradigm example of a\nproposition, after all).\n\nAlong the same lines, Kareem Khalifa claims that abilities are\ninvolved in understanding, but holds that they are \u201cespecially\nunspecial\u201d (Khalifa 2017b: 56). For Khalifa, the modal character\nof abilities is evident in normal scientific practice, because as\nscientists evaluate explanations on the basis of testing they\nnaturally rule out inadequate explanations and gravitate towards\nwell-supported ones. But evaluating and testing hypotheses in this way\ndoes not appear to require anything exotic or special from a\npsychological point of view, or to entail that the object of\nunderstanding is not propositional.\n\nFinally, psychologists themselves have increasingly focused on\ncharacterizing the cognitive profile of understanding. Thus Tania\nLombrozo and colleagues have explored the question of why we seek\nunderstanding, and how activities such as offering explanations aid in\nthe acquisition and retention of understanding (Lombrozo, 2012;\nWilliams & Lombrozo, 2010, 2013; Lombrozo & Wilkenfeld 2019).\nPsychologists have also explored the empirical question of how good\n(or bad) we are at identifying real relationships and dependencies in\nthe world. According to Frank Keil, for example, we are not good at\nthis at all, and we frequently fall prey to illusions of understanding\n(Keil 2006; cf. Ylikoski 2009). For instance, we often think we\nunderstand how a helicopter achieves lift,\u00a0or how moving the\npedals on a bicycle help to propel the bike forward.\u00a0 But in both\ncases, we are often well wide of the mark (Keil 2006; cf. Grimm 2009;\nSloman & Fernbach 2017).\n2.3 Normativity of Understanding\n\nSuppose you accurately grasp that your house burned down because of\nfaulty wiring. You do not think it burned down because of a lightning\nstrike, or a stray cigarette. Faulty wiring was the cause, and you\naccurately grasp it as the cause (see Pritchard 2009, 2010 for more\ndetails on a case like this).\n\nIs that all there is to understanding why your house burned down? Or\ndoes it also matter, for example, how one comes to grasp this\nrelationship? These questions push us to ask about the normative\ndimension of understanding, and in particular to ask: Are there better\nand worse ways to come by one\u2019s grasp, and does this matter for\nthe acquisition of understanding? For example, are careful experiments\nor good evidence needed? Or can one come by one\u2019s grasp more or\nless by luck, and yet still in a way that generates understanding?\n\nA parallel question with respect to knowledge would ask: Supposing you\nhave a true belief, is that all there is to knowledge? And here most\nwould say \u201cno\u201d. In addition to the true belief, how\nyou came by that true belief is also important. Is it\nbased on good evidence, or a reliable process, or a well-functioning\ndesign plan? When it comes to knowledge, these further normative\nquestions clearly matter. It is therefore not surprising that the same\nsorts of questions have been asked with respect to understanding.\n\nWhile some argue that the normative profile of understanding is\nessentially the same as the normative profile of knowledge (Grimm\n2006; Khalifa 2013, 2017b; Greco 2014), others claim that they differ\nin important ways, and especially with respect to the way in which\nunderstanding, but not knowledge, seems compatible with luck.\nAmong theorists who see a difference between knowledge and\nunderstanding here, we can distinguish those who claim that\nunderstanding can be fully externally lucky from those who\nthink it can only be partly externally lucky.\n\nA leading advocate of the fully externally lucky view is\nJonathan Kvanvig, who argues that how one comes by one\u2019s\naccurate grasp matters\u2014what we might call the\n\u201cetiology\u201d of the accurate grasp\u2014but it does not\nmatter in all the same ways that we find in cases of knowledge (see\nespecially Kvanvig 2003). In particular, it matters that the grasp was\nacquired in a way that was internally appropriate\n(especially, in accord with the evidence in one\u2019s possession),\nbut it does not matter that the grasp was externally\nappropriate\u2014for example, that one came by one\u2019s\nevidence in a reliable way. Thus Kvanvig argues:\n\n\nWhat is distinctive about understanding has to do with the way in\nwhich an individual combines pieces of information into a unified\nbody. This point is not meant to imply that truth is not important for\nunderstanding, for we have noted already the factive character of both\nknowledge and understanding. But once we move past its facticity, the\ngrasping of relations between items of information is central to the\nnature of understanding. By contrast, when we move past the facticity\nof knowledge, the central features involve non-accidental connections\nbetween mind and world. (Kvanvig 2003: 197)\n\n\nFor instance, suppose you read a history book full of inaccurate facts\nabout the Comanche dominance of the Southern Plains in the nineteenth\ncentury, but your dyslexia miraculously transforms them all into\ntruths (Kvanvig 2009). For Kvanvig, despite the one-in-a-billion\nluckiness of your grasp\u2019s origins, you could nonetheless come to\nan understanding of this topic. So long as the accuracy and internal\nappropriateness conditions are satisfied, how you came by your\naccurate grasp is not important.\n\nOther philosophers have objected to Kvanvig\u2019s account. On their\nview, it is implausible to think you can come to understand the world\nthrough sheer external luck, or (perhaps worse) through being the\nvictim of massive deception (Grimm 2006; Pritchard 2010; Khalifa\n2017b: ch. 7; Kelp 2021). Thus Pritchard claims that one needs to\nacquire one\u2019s accurate grasp \u201cin the right fashion\u201d\n(Pritchard 2010: 108) or \u201cin the right kind of way\u201d\n(Pritchard 2010: 110)\u2014in other words, by means of a reliable\nsource or method. One\u2019s grasp therefore cannot be the result of\n\u201cGettier luck\u201d\u2014where, for instance, by sheer chance\na story intended to deceive you happens to be right (Pritchard\n2010).\n\nAt the same time, philosophers such as Pritchard and Alison Hills hold\nthat understanding does tolerate certain kinds of luck, and\nin a way that propositional knowledge does not (Pritchard 2010; Hills\n2016). They therefore hold that understanding can be\u00a0partly\nexternally lucky. Thus imagine your environment is filled with\nmisleading information about some event\u2014the fire that destroyed\nyour house, for example. Suppose that only Source X will offer\nyou the truth about the fire\u2014that faulty wiring was the\ncause\u2014while all of the other sources will offer plausible but\nmistaken accounts. If you luckily rely on Source X, that source\ncan enable you to understand why the event occurred, even though it\ncannot generate knowledge about why it occurred, due to the presence\nof what Pritchard calls \u201cenvironmental luck\u201d. The upshot,\non this view, is that while understanding is compatible with\nenvironmental luck, it is not compatible with Gettier luck. They\nconclude from this that since knowledge is compatible with neither\nGettier luck nor environmental luck, understanding is not a species of\nknowledge.\n\n(For recent empirical studies regarding the compatibility of judgments\nof understanding with luck, and finding mixed support for this\ncompatibility, see Wilkenfeld et al. 2018; Carter et al. 2019.)\n\nRegarding the normative profile of understanding and its relation to\nknowledge, others have argued that understanding is not vulnerable to\ndefeat, especially in the face of known counterevidence, in the way\nthat knowledge is (Hills 2016; Dells\u00e9n 2017). Dells\u00e9n\nfor instance argues that if I come to believe or grasp that a car\nengine works a certain way, and it really does work that way, then my\nunderstanding of how the engine works is secure even if I have\n(misleading) evidence that the person telling me about the engine is\nunreliable (Dells\u00e9n 2017). To these philosophers, this provides\nstill another reason for thinking that understanding is not a species\nof knowledge.\n3. Special Issues in Epistemology\n3.1 The Epistemic Value of Understanding\n\nAs part of what Wayne Riggs has called the \u201cvalue turn in\nepistemology\u201d, epistemologists have increasingly attempted to\nidentify the fundamental bearers of epistemic value (Riggs 2008). From\na purely epistemic point of view, is knowledge of just any sort\nvaluable? Or is the fundamentally valuable thing instead the ability\nto provide reasons, or to possess beliefs that are in some way\n\u201cGettier proof\u201d?\n\nInto this mix some have argued that the really valuable things from an\nepistemic point of view are \u201chigher grade\u201d cognitive\naccomplishments, such as understanding or wisdom (Riggs 2003; cf.\nBaehr 2014). Thus by nature we do not seem to have any desire to\nacquire trivial pieces of information, such as the name of the 589th\nperson in the 1971 Dallas phone book. But any instance of\nunderstanding might seem worth pursuing or in some way worthwhile;\nthus Riggs writes,\n\n\nit seems to me that any understanding, even of some subject matter we\nmay consider trivial or mundane, contributes to the epistemic value of\none\u2019s life. (2003: 217)\n\n\nUnderstanding might therefore be a better candidate for a\nfundamentally valuable epistemic state than knowledge or truth.\n\nJust why understanding might have this property is up for debate. Some\nproposals focus on the \u201cinternal\u201d benefits that\nunderstanding is alleged to provide. According to Zagzebski (2001),\nunderstanding has a kind of first-person transparency, tied to an\nability to articulate reasons, that we do not always find in cases of\nknowledge. Thus to say a chicken-sexer knows the sex of a\nparticular chicken without being able to cite his or her grounds is\none thing, but to say that someone understands some subject\nmatter\u2014say, the U.S. Civil War\u2014without being able to\nexplain it or to describe how the subject\u2019s different elements\ndepend upon and relate to one another seems like another, more\nimplausible step (cf. Pritchard 2010). Understanding therefore\narguably provides \u201ca more natural home\u201d (cf. Kvanvig 2003:\n1993) for internalist intuitions in epistemology than knowledge,\nbecause it seems to more naturally appeal to notions such as\ntransparency, articulacy, and reason-giving than knowledge. (For the\nview that understanding too can be inarticulate, see Grimm 2017.)\n\nAnother view, from Pritchard (2009, 2010), is that any instance of\nunderstanding is valuable because it counts as an achievement, and\nachievements are the kinds of things that are distinctively and\nfinally valuable. Instances of understanding count as achievements\n(and indeed what Pritchard calls strong achievements) either\nbecause they involve overcoming an obstacle or because they bring to\nbear \u201csignificant cognitive ability\u201d. For Pritchard,\nhowever, the same cannot be said for any instance of knowledge. For\nexample, in many cases I might come to believe the truth on the basis\nof testimony, but the credit for my true belief seems to belong more\nto the testifier than to me (cf. Lackey 2007). I do not reach the\ntruth on this question primarily because of my ability or skill, but\nbecause of the ability or skill of the testifier; such items of\nknowledge therefore do not count as achievements, and hence lack final\nvalue.\n\nAgainst this, some have objected that there are many cases of\n\u201ceasy understanding\u201d where no significant obstacle seems\nto be involved, and no significant cognitive ability at play (e.g.,\nLawler 2019). For instance, it seems I could come to understand why my\ntumble-dryer isn\u2019t working\u2014because it is\nunplugged\u2014quite easily and without bringing to bear any\nparticularly significant cognitive ability (Carter & Gordon 2014:\n5). It has therefore been claimed that not just any item of\nunderstanding is valuable, and particularly not just any item of\n\u201cunderstanding why\u201d. Rather, only so-called objectual\nunderstanding is distinctively valuable, where objectual\nunderstanding is said to concern \u201cwide\u201d subject matters\nthat involve \u201ca large network of propositions and relations\nbetween those propositions\u201d (Carter & Gordon 2014: 8; cf.\nKhalifa 2017b: ch. 8).\n\nA final proposal is that understanding is a better candidate for the\ngoal of inquiry than knowledge (Pritchard 2016; cf. Kvanvig\n2003: 202 and Kelp 2021). Suppose you learn from a reliable source\nthat the rising and falling of the tides are due to the moon\u2019s\ngravitational pull. You will then apparently have knowledge of why the\ntides rise and fall, but according to Pritchard this knowledge will\nnot properly close your inquiry or satisfy your curiosity.\n\n\nIndeed, one would expect our subject to continue asking questions of\nher informant until she gains a proper explanatory grip on how cause\nand effect are related; mere knowledge of the cause will not suffice.\n(Pritchard 2016: 34)\n\n\nOn this view, an explanation of how cause and effect are related is\nessential to understanding why, and one\u2019s inquiry will not reach\nits natural end until one resolves this question.\n3.2 Testimony\n\nA key issue in social epistemology is whether understanding, like\nordinary propositional knowledge, can be transmitted via\ntestimony. Thus it seems that I can transmit my knowledge to you that\nthe next train is arriving at 4:15, just by telling you. Transmitting\nunderstanding, however, does not seem to work so easily, if it is\npossible at all. According to Myles Burnyeat,\n\n\nUnderstanding is not transmissible in the same sense as knowledge is.\nIt is not the case that in normal contexts of communication the\nexpression of understanding imparts understanding to one\u2019s\nhearer as the expression of knowledge can and often does impact\nunderstanding. (Burnyeat 1980: 186)\n\n\nThus a teacher might try to convey her understanding of some subject\nmatter\u2014say, of how Type II Diabetes works\u2014but there is no\nguarantee that the understanding will in fact be transmitted,\nor that her students will come to see or grasp what she herself sees\nand grasps.\n\nSupposing that understanding cannot be transmitted by testimony, there\nare a few explanations for why this might be the case. For one,\nZagzebski argues that the kind of \u201cseeing\u201d or\n\u201cgrasping\u201d that seems integral to understanding is\nsomething a person can only do \u201cfirst hand\u201d\u2014it\ncannot be inherited from anyone else (Zagzebski 2008: ch. 6). For\nanother, and according to Hills, if we agree that understanding is a\nskill or ability, then understanding will be difficult or impossible\nto transmit because skills and abilities in general are difficult or\nimpossible to transmit (Hills 2009, 2020). It is therefore a specific\ncase of a more general phenomena.\n\nOthers have argued that understanding is not, in fact, so difficult to\ntransmit. Suppose I ask why you are late for our meeting, and you tell\nme \u201ctraffic\u201d. It then seems like you have transmitted your\nunderstanding to me quite directly\u2014apparently just as directly\nas when you communicate your knowledge to me that the next train is\ncoming at 4:15 (Grimm 2020). What seems required for successful\ntransmission of understanding is thus that the right conceptual\nscaffolding is in place, on the part of the recipient. But supposing\nthe scaffolding is in place, understanding can plausibly be\ntransmitted in much the way knowledge can (Boyd 2017; cf. Malfatti\n2019, 2020). Others argue that since something like propositional\nknowledge of causes entails at least a low degree of understanding, a\nlow degree of understanding can be transmitted via testimony in the\nsame way as knowledge can (Hu 2019).\n\nIt has also been pointed out that even if we agree that seeing or\ngrasping needs to be first-hand, and that others cannot do this for\nme, the same \u201cfirst-handedness\u201d apparently holds for\nbelief. That is, no one else can believe for me, because\nbelieving is a first-personal act (Hazlett forthcoming: sec. 2.3). But\njust as this fact about belief does not lead us to think that\npropositional knowledge cannot be transmitted, so too it should not\nlead us to think that understanding cannot be transmitted (Boyd\n2017).\n\nIn relation to moral testimony in particular, understanding has been\ninvoked to explain why it often seems odd or \u201cfishy\u201d to\ndefer to others about moral issues, such as whether eating meat is\nmorally wrong (for an overview, see Callahan 2020; cf. Riaz 2015). One\nexplanation of the fishiness is that the epistemic good we really want\nwith respect to moral questions is not mere knowledge but rather\nunderstanding. It is then said, for reasons tied to those just\nmentioned, that understanding cannot be easily (if at all) transmitted\nby testimony\u2014either because it is an ability, and abilities\ncannot easily be transmitted (Hills 2009, 2013, 2016) or because\ngenuine understanding in moral matters involves a suite of emotional\nand affective responses that cannot easily be transmitted by testimony\n(Callahan 2018). Deferring to moral testimony is therefore fishy, it\nis argued, because it does not get us the epistemic good we really\nwant\u2014moral understanding.\n\n4. Special Issues in the Philosophy of Science\n4.1 Explanation and Understanding\n\nWe seek explanations for an epistemic benefit, but how should we think\nabout that benefit? We noted above (Section 1.2) that philosophers\nsuch as Hempel have significant reservations about thinking about the\nbenefit in terms of understanding. As they point out, just as a\nmistaken explanation can generate a \u201cfeeling\u201d of\nunderstanding in some people, so too an accurate explanation might\nleave people cold.\n\nIn response to this concern, others note that the feeling of\nunderstanding (or the phenomenology of understanding) should not be\nconfused with the epistemic state itself, any more than the feeling of\nknowing should be confused with the epistemic state of knowledge (de\nRegt 2004, 2017). But even if this move is granted, and we think of\nunderstanding as a full-bodied epistemic state and not a mere feeling,\nthe relationship between explanation and understanding remains\ncontroversial.\n\nAccording to what we might call an \u201cunderstanding-first\u201d\napproach to the relationship, thinking about the epistemology of\nunderstanding is indispensable for thinking about what makes for a\ngood explanation. More exactly, because we seem to assess the goodness\nor badness of an explanation in terms of its ability to generate\nunderstanding, understanding is in some sense conceptually prior to,\nor more basic than, the notion of explanation. Thus intuitions about\nunderstanding are often taken to be diagnostic of the goodness (the\nexplanatoriness) of an explanation (Wilkenfeld 2013; cf. Wilkenfeld\n& Lombrozo 2020), and if we can think of a case where all of the\nconditions for the theory of explanation are met, but understanding\ndoes not result, that is a reason to reject the sufficiency of the\nconditions (see, e.g., Woodward 2003: 195, in diagnosing\nHempel\u2019s view). Similarly, if we have understanding in ways not\nsanctioned by the theory, that is reason to think the conditions are\nnot necessary. More generally, an advocate of the\n\u201cunderstanding-first\u201d approach would likely concur with\nPaul Humphreys\u2019s claim that:\n\n\nScientific understanding provides a far richer terrain than does\nscientific explanation and the latter is best viewed as a vehicle to\nunderstanding, rather than an end in itself. (Humphreys 2000: 267; cf.\nPotochnik 2017: ch. 5)\n\n\nAgainst understanding-first approaches, there are\n\u201cdebunking\u201d approaches according to which understanding is\nof little if any help to accounts of explanation. (More positively,\nthese might simply be considered \u201cexplanation-first\u201d\napproaches.) Thus Khalifa argues that attempts to revive understanding\nas a central notion in the philosophy of science have amounted to\nlittle more than a repackaging of existing models of explanation\n(Khalifa 2012, 2017b: ch. 3), and that strictly speaking all one needs\nfor a plausible account of understanding is a plausible account of\nwhat counts as a good or correct explanation, combined with a\nplausible account of knowledge. Understanding therefore amounts to\nknowing a correct explanation. But then nothing new or\nspecial is needed to theorize about understanding; our accounts of\nexplanation and our theories of knowledge do all the important\ntheoretical work (see especially Khalifa 2017b; cf. Kelp 2015).\n\nSimilarly, consider the following attempt, from Bradford Skow, to\ncharacterize the relationship between explanation and\nunderstanding:\n\n\nSomething E is an explanation of why Q only if\nsomeone who possesses E understands why Q. (Skow\n2018: 214)\n\n\nThis condition on explanation cannot help us as theorists, Skow\nargues, because it is not even true. Thus suppose we construe\n\u201cpossessing\u201d an explanation as knowing an\nexplanation. Plugged into the formula, the result is that one cannot\nknow an explanation of why Q unless that knowledge constitutes\nan understanding of why Q. But, plausibly, we can know an\nexplanation of why Q without understanding why Q. For\nexample, someone can know why the litmus paper turned\nred\u2014because it was dipped in acid\u2014without understanding\nwhy it turned red (Skow 2018: 215). This suggests it takes\nmore to understand why p than simply to know why p. In the\ncase of the litmus paper, Skow claims one also needs to appreciate\nhow the acid turns the paper red, or why it turns it\nred.\n\nOpinions differ about the force of such examples. According to some,\nto require that understanding why p involves knowledge of mechanisms\nor deeper processes in this way would annihilate most of our everyday\nunderstanding (Grimm 2019a). Thus I can apparently understand why my\neyes are watering\u2014because I am chopping onions\u2014without\nappreciating anything about the mechanism or connection that underlies\nthe watering. Others argue that there is indeed understanding in these\ncases, although perhaps not a lot (Sliwa 2015).\n4.2 Understanding and Idealization\n\nA longstanding puzzle in the philosophy of science concerns how\nidealized models and representations (\u201cidealizations\u201d, for\nshort) allow cognitive access to the world. The puzzle is that\nalthough idealizations seem to provide real epistemic benefits, the\nbenefits cannot apparently be identified with truth, because to the\nextent that they falsify or mispresent the world, idealizations often\nfail to reflect the truth. For example, idealizations often appeal to\nentities that do not and perhaps cannot exist\u2014fully rational\nagents, frictionless planes, etc. Or they subtract important worldly\nelements from their accounts\u2014e.g., long range inter-molecular\nforces.\n\nYet if idealizations provide epistemic benefits, and we cannot readily\nthink of the benefits in terms of truth, then how exactly should we\nthink about them? According to some philosophers, we should think not\nin terms of truth but rather in terms of understanding. Understanding\nis the epistemic benefit we receive from idealizations, and\nunderstanding and truth can come apart. On this view, understanding\n(unlike knowledge) can therefore be \u201cnon-factive\u201d (Elgin\n2004, 2017; Potochnik 2017; cf. Sullivan & Khalifa 2019).\n\nFor instance, Elgin asks us to consider a paint sample we might see in\na hardware store\u2014say, of the shade jonquil yellow (Elgin 2017:\n187). While the sample might in fact be subtly different than the\nactual shade, and hence in that sense misrepresent it, it nonetheless\nseems to provide epistemic access to the shade. Idealizations such as\nthe Ideal Gas Law or Snell\u2019s law work are then held to work in a\nsimilar way. They represent not by mirroring but rather by\nexemplifying certain aspects of the target system, and via the\nmechanism of exemplification enable understanding of the system (Elgin\n2017).\n\nOthers agree that idealizations enable scientists to understand the\nworld even though, strictly speaking, the\u00a0idealizations\nmisrepresent their target systems. According to Angela Potochnik\n(2017), this is because the systems studied by scientists are\nenormously complex networks of causal patterns and interactions.\nParticular interests and cognitive limitations will lead scientists to\nfocus on some of these causal patterns and neglect others, and they\nmight get those particular patterns right. In the process, however,\nthey will misrepresent the actual messy complexity of the target\nsystem, and the understanding of phenomena that results will thereby\nbe non-factive.\n\nFor Strevens, idealizations enable understanding because they draw\nattention to the difference makers that bring about the thing to be\nexplained (Strevens 2017). More exactly, idealizations help us to\nappreciate the factors that make a difference to bringing about the\nphenomena we want to explain, and to identifying the factors that do\nnot make a difference. The Ideal Gas Law helps us to understand the\nBoylean behavior of a gas, for example, even though the law imagines\nthat there are zero long-range forces at work, because the existence\nof those long-rage forces does not make a difference to the derivation\nof the Boylean behavior: they are insignificant enough that their\nvalues can be set to zero without loss.\n\nOne difference between theorists such as Strevens and Potochnik may\nlie in the nature of the explanandum. For Potochnik, it seems clear\nthat the thing to be explained is a concrete, coarse-grained\nphenomenon: the behavior of a gas in a container, for example. For\nStrevens, it is a more abstract, fine-grained, and high-level event:\nthe expansion of the gas. Thus for Strevens the thing to be explained\nis something along the lines of: that the gas expanded, not\nhow it expanded. If one were to hold the explanandum\nconsistent, there might be notable agreement between these views\n(though see Potochnik 2016 for further discussion).\n5. Humanistic Understanding\n\nTo this point we have mainly focused on what it takes to understand\nphenomena in the natural world, such as rusting metal bars, or the\nrising and falling of the tides, or the behavior of gases. A\nlongstanding question, however, especially in the Continental\ntradition of philosophy and especially in the philosophy of the social\nsciences, is whether understanding human beings and their artifacts\nrequires something different and distinctive from an epistemic point\nof view\u2014perhaps, for example, a distinctive set of abilities or\nmethodologies, tied to the distinctive objects (or, importantly,\nsubjects!) we are trying to understand.\n\nMoreover, a long string of influential thinkers\u2014starting roughly\nwith Giambattista Vico and continuing through figures such Wilhelm\nDilthey and R. G. Collingwood\u2014answer this question\naffirmatively. Distinctive abilities and perhaps methodologies\ndo come on the scene when we try to understand human beings,\nat least when we try to understand them in a particular way. In broad\nstrokes, the idea is that there is a kind of understanding of other\nhuman beings that we can only acquire by reconstructing their\nperspectives\u2014in some sense, \u201cfrom within\u201d those\nperspectives and according to their own terms (cf. Ismael 2018).\n\nSometimes this approach has been referred to as \u201cthe\nverstehen tradition\u201d\u2014in honor of its special\nroots in the German tradition, and leaving untranslated the German\nword for understanding (Martin 2000; Feest 2010). Alternative labels\nfor this approach include \u201cthe interpretative tradition\u201d,\n\u201cthe historicist tradition\u201d, \u201cthe hermeneutic\ntradition\u201d, and \u201cthe humanistic tradition\u201d (for\noverviews, see Hiley et al. 1992; Stueber 2012). For convenience, we\nwill refer to this as \u201cthe humanistic tradition\u201d.\nIt is not an essential part of this tradition that human beings can\nonly be understood by reconstructing their perspectives, but\nthe tradition does characteristically claim that there is special\nvalue in trying to do so. It also typically claims that taking up\nperspectives \u201cfrom within\u201d requires distinctive cognitive\nresources and perhaps distinctive methods\u2014resources and methods\nthat are not clearly needed when we attempt to understand natural\nphenomena.\n\nGiambattista Vico (1668\u20131744) was among the first to try to\narticulate how exactly understanding human beings differs from\nunderstanding the natural world (see especially Vico 1725 [2002].)\nAccording to Vico, just as we have a special scienza\n(knowledge or understanding) of things we have made or produced\nourselves, so too we can have special insight into things that other\nhuman beings have made or produced\u2014where the things made or\nproduced included not just physical artifacts but also human actions.\nVico further postulated a special ability\u2014fantasia, or\nreconstructive imagination\u2014by which we can enter into the minds\nof others and see the world through their eyes and in terms of their\ncategories of thought (Miller 1993: ch. 5).\n\nFurther north in Europe, Johann Gottfried Herder (1744\u20131803)\nheld that because human nature is not static, or fixed irrespective of\ntime and place, understanding alien cultures requires a process of\nEinf\u00fchlung\u2014a \u201cfeeling one\u2019s way\ninto\u201d\u2014the culture in question, in all its specificity and\nperhaps with an eye to its particular genius. In Herder\u2019s hands,\nhowever, Einf\u00fchlung was not a quasi-mystical or\nirrational attempt to leap into the minds of others. Instead, it was\noften a slow, methodical process that needed to be aided by careful\nhistorical-philological inquiry (Forster 2002: xvii). (For central\ntexts, see Herder 2002.)\n\nIn the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, Wilhelm Dilthey\n(1833\u20131911) became the most celebrated advocate of the idea that\nthe human sciences\u2014in German, the\nGeisteswissenschaften, such as history\u2014had a different\nfocus than the natural sciences, and centered on the idea of inner or\nlived experience. (See Dilthey 1883 [1989] for a\ncharacteristic work.) Someone\u2019s lived experience, moreover, was\nconstituted not only by their beliefs or attitudes, but also by their\nemotions and volitions. For Dilthey, as Frederick Beiser puts the\nidea,\n\n\nWe understand an episode in a person\u2019s life only when we see how\nit plays a role in realizing his basic values, his conception of what\nmakes life worth living. (Beiser 2011: 334)\n\n\nIn England, the humanistic approach was championed especially by R. G.\nCollingwood (1889\u20131943). According to Collingwood, what\ndistinguishes human history from, say, geological history, is that\nhuman history is suffused with thought\u2014i.e., it is a record of\nhuman aspirations, goals, beliefs, frustrations, and so on. We can,\nmoreover, have two possible stances towards these thoughts. We can try\nto map them from a third person point of view, and identify the\nvarious ways the thoughts depend upon and relate to one another. But\nwe can also try to \u201cre-enact\u201d or \u201crethink\u201d\nthem (D\u2019Oro 2000, 2004). Thus Collingwood held that,\n\n\nThe events of history are never mere phenomena, never mere spectacles\nfor contemplation, but things which the historian looks, not at, but\nthrough, to discern the thought within them. (Collingwood 1946 [1993:\n214])\n\n5.1 Perspective-taking and its Critics\n\nA central tenet of the humanistic tradition is that when an agent has\na first-person perspective on the world, there is value in trying to\n\u201ctake up\u201d or \u201cassume\u201d that perspective, rather\nthan simply trying to map that agent\u2019s perspective from a\ndetached, third-person perspective. Abraham Lincoln for instance,\ncould presumably be understood from a third-person, detached\nperspective by a psychologist adept at mapping the various ways in\nwhich Lincoln\u2019s beliefs and desires, hopes and fears, seemed to\ndepend upon and relate to one another. What the humanistic tradition\nsays is that even if the psychologist were to do this exquisitely, so\nthat all of these relationships were accurately plotted, there would\nstill be an important sort of understanding missing\u2014an\nunderstanding of what it was like to be Lincoln from the inside, or to\nregard the world as he regarded it, at least in part.\n\nPhilosophers differ about the epistemic value of this project of\nperspective-taking. Thus some claim that there are certain\nfacts that only show up from a first-person point of view\n(Nagel 1974), and hence can only be apprehended from that point of\nview. For instance, if I want to apprehend facts about \u201cwhat it\nis like\u201d to experience the world from your perspective, I\narguably need to try to place myself, somehow, in that perspective.\nOthers claim that certain concepts only show up for us from a\nfirst-personal, engaged perspective. For instance, perhaps the concept\nof chronic pain can only be acquired by someone who has experienced\nit, or the concept of romantic love, or racial bigotry. A related view\nis that while these concepts can perhaps be acquired without\nthe relevant first-person experience, they cannot be adequately\ngrasped or mastered without that experience. As Stephen Turner\nwrites:\n\nWhen a mother tells her 13 year old daughter that she does not know\nwhat \u201clove\u201d is, she is not making a comment about\nsemantics; she is pointing to the nonlinguistic experiential\nconditions that are bound up with the understanding of the term that\nthe daughter does not share. (Turner 2019: 254)\n\nThe thought here seems to be that while the daughter might have the\nconcept of love, her grasp of the concept will be extremely poor\nwithout the benefit of the first-person experience, and her attempts\nto apply it will be unreliable.\n\nIn fields such as anthropology, ethnography, and sociology, and in the\nphilosophical areas that reflect on these disciplines (primarily, the\nphilosophy of social science), questions related to the epistemic\nvalue of perspective-taking gave rise to debates about whether it is\nnecessary to immerse oneself in a society in order to understand it\nadequately. According to some, the answer is \u201cyes\u201d: if I\nwant to understand a society or culture, I need to understand it from\nthe participants\u2019 perspective, with special sensitivity to the\nconcepts and rules that guide the participants\u2019 perspective,\neven if only implicitly (see especially Winch 1958, 1964). It is then\nsometimes claimed that one can only really grasp or master these\nconcepts by participating in the relevant form of life. As the\nethnographer James Spradley writes:\n\n\nImmersion is the time-honored strategy used by most ethnographers. By\ncutting oneself off from other interests and concerns, by listening to\ninformants hours on end, by participating in the cultural scene, and\nby allowing one\u2019s mental life to be taken over by the new\nculture, themes [the implicit beliefs of a culture] often emerge\n\u2026 This type of immersion will often reveal new relationships\namong domains and bring to light cultural themes you cannot discover\nany other way. (Spradley 1980: 145; cf. Kampa 2019)\n\n\nAnother view is that immersion, while perhaps helpful, is not strictly\nnecessary. What is necessary is recognizing the priority of the\nparticipants\u2019 perspective, and using that perspective to\ncharacterize the activities that need to be understood in the first\nplace (Taylor 1971; McCarthy 1973). If we want to make sense of what\nlooks like (say) voting or praying in another culture, we need to\nadopt that culture\u2019s way of identifying what counts as voting or\npraying (which perhaps will turn out to be a distinct but closely\nrelated activity, such as voting* or praying*). Carving up the\nbehavior according to our own categories will only\nmisrepresent what is happening and lead to misunderstanding.\n\nPeter Winch, among others, further argues that it is hard or\nimpossible to try to adopt another culture\u2019s way of carving up\nthe world without somehow taking that culture on board in a holistic\nway, because it is hard or impossible to characterize particular bits\nof behavior in isolation (Winch 1958). To make sense of what a\nmedieval knight means by praying (or praying*), for example, I might\nneed to connect this with other concepts (perhaps such as honor, or\nduty, or salvation) that again might be quite different than my own.\nThe result might then be that one gradually acquires what Alasdair\nMacIntyre calls a \u201csecond first language\u201d, as one\u2019s\ngrasp of the relationships between different concepts and their\napplications increases (MacIntyre 1988: ch. 19).\n\nAgainst the push for perspective-taking as a source of understanding,\nespecially in the social sciences, at least three strains of criticism\narose: Positivist, Critical, and Gadamerian.\n\nThe Positivist critique\u2014associated with thinkers such as\nTheodore Abel (1948), Ernest Nagel (1953), and Richard Rudner\n(1966)\u2014had a number of prongs. For one thing, there were grave\ndoubts about the reliability of the processes associated with\nperspective taking. After all, it seems all too easy to project\none\u2019s own cares and concerns onto the minds of others. It was\nalso argued that reliving experiences, to the extent that this is\npossible, does not actually amount to an explanation of why the\nexperiences happened. I could, after all, have lived through a series\nof events myself, but not been able to explain or understand\nthem\u2014so why should imaginatively living through someone\nelse\u2019s experiences, to the extent this is possible,\nautomatically grant me understanding? (For an overview of these\nobjections, see Martin 2000; Fay 2016; Beiser 2019.)\n\nCritical Theorists have argued that the first-person perspective is\nnot the most theoretically or politically important perspective,\nbecause it often masks deeper and more significant sources of behavior\n(see Warnke 2019). The deeper sources might include an agent\u2019s\nown, unacknowledged motivations, or they might include the\npresuppositions, power dynamics, and economic conditions of the\nsociety that shaped the possibility spaces in which the agent moves.\nIt is thus what happens \u201cbehind the back\u201d of the subject\nthat is often crucial for truly understanding behavior\u2014the\nhidden impulses and power dynamics and systems of oppression that are\noften obscured from the perspective of the agent, sometimes in an\nunacknowledged way by the agent herself. (Here we also find\ninfluential Marxist and Feminist analyses and critiques. See Alcoff\n2005; Warnke 2014.)\u00a0A hybrid view, from Habermas, is that we need\nto be able to shift back and forth between the subject\u2019s\nperspective and the structural perspective, if we are to properly\nunderstand the reality of social life (Habermas 1981 [1984/1987]; for\nan overview, see Baynes 2016).\n\nThe Gadamerian critique, finally, is that we can never fully jump\noutside of our own cares and concerns in order to adopt the cares and\nconcerns of others. Reliving or re-experiencing\u2014 in the sense of\ntransposing ourselves out of our framework and into\nthe framework of other agents or cultures\u2014is thus an impossible\nideal. Instead, we always take our frameworks with us (Gadamer 1960\n[1989]). For Gadamer, what understanding others\u2014and especially\ntheir written or spoken words\u2014requires is not transposing\nourselves into their worldviews, but trying to fuse our worldviews in\nsome way (Horizontverschmelzung). Perhaps, for example, my\nconception of voting or prayer will become enlarged or modified by\nengaging with the conceptions I find in other cultures, and perhaps\nespecially through a dialogue with the texts of those cultures.\nWhether this fusion essentially amounts to a project of translation\n(from one worldview to another), or something else is a matter for\ndebate. (See Vessey 2009 for an overview.)\n5.2 Understanding as an Ontological Category\n\nAn additional question, especially in the Continental tradition, is\nwhether we should think of understanding primarily in epistemic terms.\nPerhaps it is better to think of understanding as an\nontological category\u2014a way of being in the\nworld\u2014rather than an epistemic one (for an overview, see\nFeh\u00e9r 2016).\n\nAccording to Heidegger\u2019s influential account, for instance,\nunderstanding is not a cognitive act that we might or might not\nperform. Rather, it is our fundamental way of living in the world, and\nwe are \u201calways already\u201d engaged in understanding. Thus he\nwrites that:\n\n\nUnderstanding is not an acquaintance derived from knowledge, but a\nprimordially existential kind of being, which, more than anything\nelse, makes such knowledge and acquaintance possible (123\u20134;\ntrans. by Wrathall 2013).\n\n\nJust as Descartes spoke of himself as a res cogitans\u2014a\nthinking thing\u2014so for Heidegger we are, fundamentally,\nunderstanding things. As Gadamer elaborates the Heideggerian idea:\n\n\nUnderstanding is\u2026 the original form of the realization of\nDasein, which is being-in-the-world. Before any differentiation of\nunderstanding into the various directions of pragmatic or theoretical\ninterest, understanding is Dasein\u2019s mode of being. (Gadamer 1960\n[1989: 259])\n\n\nOne central element of this view is that we are always projecting\npossibilities onto the world around us. Or rather, it is not as if the\nworld first presents itself as a bare thing empty of possibilities,\nand then we construe it as possessing these possibilities; instead,\nour experience of the world is from the first suffused with this sense\nof possibility. To take an example that Samantha Matherne (2019) uses\nto illustrate Heidegger\u2019s view: when I first apprehend the\nmartini in front of me, I take it as offering a variety of\npossibilities\u2014to be sipped, to be thrown, to be shaken, to be\nstirred. If I then take the martini as to be sipped, I am seizing on\none of these possibilities and interpreting the martini in light of\nthis specific possibility. But my experience of the drink was never\ndevoid of an apprehension of possibilities altogether.\n\nA further question is why, on the Heideggerian framework, the state of\nprojecting possibilities does not count as epistemic or\ntruth-evaluable, even if we allow that it is also in some sense\nontological. After all, the possibilities that we project onto the\nworld might not be genuine or grounded in reality. As Grimm (2008)\nnotes, someone might think that apparently solid things (like\nbaseballs) could not possibly pass through other apparently solid\nthings (like tables), but learning about quantum tunneling might call\nthis into question, and transform one\u2019s sense of possibility.\nThere thus seem to be facts about the possibilities that the world\naffords, and it seems like a mind could either track these facts\naccurately, or not. But this appears to be a topic of interest not\njust to ontologists or metaphysicians, but to epistemologists as well\n(cf. Westphal 1999).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Abel, Theodore, 1948, \u201cThe Operation Called\nVerstehen\u201d, <em>American Journal of Sociology</em>, 54(3):\n211\u2013218. doi:10.1086/220318", "Alcoff, Linda Mart\u00edn, 2005, <em>Visible Identities: Race,\nGender, and the Self</em>, New York: Oxford University Press.\ndoi:10.1093/0195137345.001.0001", "Annas, Julia, 1981, <em>An Introduction to Plato\u2019s\nRepublic</em>, New York: Oxford University Press.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1990, \u201cStoic Epistemology\u201d, in\n<em>Epistemology: Companions to Ancient Thought</em>, Stephen Everson\n(ed.), New York: Cambridge University Press, pp.184\u2013203.", "Baehr, Jason, 2014, \u201cSophia: Theoretical Wisdom and\nContemporary Epistemology\u201d, in Timpe and Boyd 2014:\n303\u2013323.", "Baumberger, Christoph, Claus Beisbart, and Georg Brun, 2017,\n\u201cWhat is Understanding?
