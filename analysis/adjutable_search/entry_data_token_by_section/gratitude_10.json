    "main_text": "Accounts of Gratitude || Gratitude as Reactive Attitude\n4.2 Gratitude as Reactive Attitude\n\nGratitude is sometimes described as a reactive\nattitude\u2014a term originally coined by P.F. Strawson (1974)\nto characterize certain natural responses we as humans have to the\ngoodwill, ill will or disregard other persons evince for us.\nResentment, for instance, is the fitting reactive attitude to a lack\nof goodwill, or presence of ill will, toward oneself from another\nperson. For Strawson, the reactive attitudes also include\nvicarious attitudes\u2014reactions to the ill will others\nevince toward third parties. The vicarious reactive analog to\nresentment, for instance, would be indignation. Reactive attitudes can\nbe had toward oneself as well, as in the guilt a wrongdoer might feel\nupon committing a resentment-worthy act of ill will or disregard. What\nthe reactive attitudes have in common, according to Strawson, is that\nthey \u201crest on\u201d and \u201creflect\u201d expectations and\ndemands for minimal levels of goodwill we make of others. In this way,\nthe reactive attitudes are expressed in (and perhaps constitutive of)\ntreating other agents as morally responsible. The reactive attitudes\nthus fundamentally differ from the \u201cobjective\u201d attitudes\nwe might take toward inanimate objects, or toward others\u2019\nbehavior that does not evince any ill will. Such events and behaviors\nmight make us angry or joyful; but only when they reflect a\nresponsible agent\u2019s goodwill or ill will as falling below or\nrising above a normative expectation is a reactive attitude, like\nresentment or gratitude, appropriate. To conceptualize gratitude as a\nStrawsonian reactive attitude, then, is to see it as the proper\nreaction to another person\u2019s exceeding minimum expectations of\ngoodwill toward oneself\u2014a reaction which is the positive\ncorrelate of resentment (Strawson 1974: 6); the second-personal analog\nof praise and pride; and the participant or reactive analog of the\nobjective attitudes of joy or appreciation.\n\nConceiving of gratitude within Strawson\u2019s framework of reactive\nattitudes fruitfully highlights certain distinctions and parallels\nthat are easily overlooked. For example, it nicely highlights the\ndistinction between gratitude proper (a response to the agency of\nanother person) and appreciation or joy (the objective counterpart to\nthe reactive attitude of gratitude), emphasizing that the former is a\nresponse to goodwill (see\n section 1\n above). It also highlights the fact that gratitude can sometimes,\nlike blame and resentment, play a complex communicative role: just as\nblame can both 1) recognize a person\u2019s conduct as blameworthy\nand 2) call for that person to hold herself accountable, gratitude can\n1) recognize a person\u2019s conduct as benevolent and 2) call for\nthe benefactor to recognize her benevolent act as worthy of\napprobation (Macnamara 2013). Treating gratitude within the\nStrawsonian framework also presents several theoretical challenges and\npitfalls. For instance, it may tempt us to overstate the similarities\nand overlook the asymmetries between gratitude and resentment, several\nprominent examples of which are pointed out by Justin Coates (2019).\nIn this vein, some philosophers have suggested that the traditional\nStrawsonian picture of gratitude is problematic insofar as it implies\nthat gratitude, like resentment, is an attitude through which we hold\nothers responsible (Bennett 1980: 42; Wallace 1994: 27). Strawson\n(1974) suggests that gratitude is a reactive attitude, and that the\nreactive attitudes have an essential connection to the practice of\nholding others to normative expectations. Resentment, indignation and\nguilt, for instance, are proper reactions when someone has fallen\nshort of such expectations. Pride, approval and gratitude, on this\nview, would be the proper reactions to an exceeded expectation (Martin\n2014: 120). Gratitude, however, may not always be called for in\nresponse to an exceeded expectation, and sometimes gratitude seems\ncalled for when no expectation has been exceeded (see\n section 2).\n If this is true, then gratitude is fundamentally different from\nresentment, indignation and guilt, in that gratitude is not\nconceptually tied to normative expectations. Instead, it may be\nconceptually tied to another form of interpersonal engagement, like\n\u201cnormative hope\u201d (Martin 2014).\n",
