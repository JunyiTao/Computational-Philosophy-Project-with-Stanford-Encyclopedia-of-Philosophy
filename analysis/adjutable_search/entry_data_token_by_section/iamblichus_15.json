    "main_text": "Logic and the Categories || Iamblichus\u2019 commentary work on Aristotle\n5.1 Iamblichus\u2019 commentary work on Aristotle\n\nIamblichus wrote an extensive commentary on the Categories,\nfragments of which have been preserved by Simplicius and Dexippus (a\nstudent of Iamblichus): in addition to literal quotes, Iamblichus is\nbehind much of Simplicius\u2019 extant exegesis of this treatise. We\nalso have evidence that Iamblichus wrote a commentary on\nAristotle\u2019s Prior Analytics and we know about his\nexegetical work on the De interpretatione and the De\ncaelo (see Opsomer 2015). From the first century BC onwards,\nPlatonist philosophers had been familiar with Aristotle\u2019s\nCategories: Platonists such as Eudorus of Alexandria and\nNicostratus raised objections against Aristotle\u2019s doctrine;\nPlotinus wrote a very important treatise On the Genera of\nBeing, where he critically discussed Aristotle\u2019s categories\n(Ennead VI, 1\u20133). To the best of our knowledge,\nhowever, no Platonist wrote a commentary on Aristotle\u2019s\nCategories before Porphyry, who was the author of two\ncommentaries on this treatise: a short and extant elucidation in a\nquestion-and-answer format and a very extensive commentary in seven\nbooks dedicated to someone called Gedalius, which is now lost. In\naddition, Porphyry wrote an introduction to logic, the\nIsagoge, which is closely connected to the\nCategories. With Porphyry, then, Aristotle\u2019s\nCategories became an integral part of the Platonist\ncurriculum and this was a crucial move for the subsequent history of\nLate Antique and medieval philosophy. As is often the case,\nIamblichus\u2019 exegetical work relies on Porphyry but introduces\nsome changes which are probably aimed to supplement (and possibly\nsupplant) Porphyry\u2019s approach. Simplicius informs us that\nIamblichus followed the great and now lost commentary written by\nPorphyry, while adding two distinctive features. First Iamblichus\n\u201capplied his Intellective Theory (noera the\u014dria)\neverywhere, to almost all of the chapter-headings\u201d (Simplicius,\nIn Categorias, 2.13\u201315 [DL-1972: Fr. 2], trans. Chase;\nsee Dillon 1997). Iamblichus employs the same expression, noera\nthe\u014dria in the opening section of the Reply to\nPorphyry (I, 2 [SS-2013: 4.16]), in a passage where he\ncharacterizes the mode of inquiry that is typical of theology.\nSecondly, Iamblichus took Archytas\u2019 treatise On the All\nto be Aristotle\u2019s source and he developed a thoroughly\nPythagorising interpretation of the Categories (Simplicius,\nIn Categorias, 2.15\u201325 [DL-1972: Fr. 2]; see Hoffmann\n1980). Archytas\u2019 treatise is actually a forgery which scholars\nnow date to the first century BC. Iamblichus, however, took it to be a\ngenuine work by Archytas and in doing so he claimed a Pythagorean\norigin for Aristotle\u2019s theory. To sum up, Iamblichus\u2019\nexegesis of the Categories was an integral part of his\nPythagorean philosophical programme and in interpreting the\nCategories Iamblichus made use of his metaphysical and\ntheological views. Apparently, Iamblichus pushed his reading of\nAristotle along Platonic/Pythagorean lines so far that (as later\nsources report) he did not refrain from assuming that Aristotle was\nnot opposed to Plato on the theory of Ideas (see Elias/David, In\nCategorias, 123.2\u20133).\n",
