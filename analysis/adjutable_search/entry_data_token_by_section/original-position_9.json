    "main_text": "The Arguments for the Principles of Justice from the Original Position || The Principles of Justice\n6.1 The Principles of Justice\n\nBefore turning to Rawls\u2019s arguments from the original position,\nit is helpful to have available the principles of justice and other\nprinciples that constitute Justice as Fairness.\n\nFirst Principle: \u201cEach person has an equal right to the\nmost extensive total system of equal basic liberties compatible with a\nsimilar system of liberty for all.\u201d (TJ 266)\n\nThe first principle was revised in 1982 to say \u201cEach person has\nan equal right to a fully adequate scheme of equal basic liberties\n\u2026\u201d (PL, 291) replacing \u201c\u2026 the most extensive\nscheme of equal basic liberties.\u201d) Notably, Rawls also\nintroduces in Political Liberalism, almost in passing, a\nprinciple of basic needs that precedes the first principle and\nrequires that citizens\u2019 basic needs be met at least to the\nextent that they can understand and fruitfully exercise their basic\nrights and liberties. (PL 7; JF 79n.) This social minimum is also said\nin Political Liberalism to be a \u201cconstitutional\nessential\u201d for any reasonable liberal conception of justice. (PL\n166, 228ff.; JF 47, n.7)\n\nThe basic rights and liberties protected by the first principle are\nspecified by a list (see TJ 53f., PL 291): liberty of conscience and\nfreedom of association, (TJ \u00a7\u00a733\u20134); freedom of\nthought and freedom of speech and expression (PL, pp.340\u2013363);\nthe integrity and freedom of the person and the right to hold personal\nproperty; equal rights of political participation and their fair value\n(TJ \u00a7\u00a736\u201337); and the rights and liberties protected\nby the rule of law (due process, freedom from arbitrary arrest, etc.\nTJ \u00a738). (Rawls says the right to ownership of means of\nproduction and laissez faire freedom of contract are not included\namong the basic liberties. TJ, 54 rev. Also freedom of movement and\nfree choice of occupation are said to be primary goods protected by\nfair equality of opportunity principle. PL 76, JF 58f.))\n\nSecond Principle: \u201cSocial and economic inequalities are\nto satisfy two conditions. First they must attach to offices and\npositions open to all under conditions of fair equality of\nopportunity; and second they must be to the greatest advantage of the\nleast advantaged members of society [the difference principle]\u201d\nconsistent with the just savings principle. (PL 281, JF 42\u201343,\nTJ 301/266 rev.)\n\nJust Savings Principle: Each generation should save for\nfuture generations at a savings rate that they could rationally expect\npast generations to have saved for them. (TJ \u00a744; JF\n159\u2013160)\n\nPrinciples for individuals, include (a) the natural\nduties to uphold justice, mutual respect, mutual aid, and not to\ninjure or harm the innocent (TJ \u00a7\u00a719, 51); and (b) the\nprinciple of fairness, to do one\u2019s fair share in just or\nnearly just practices and institutions from which one accepts their\nbenefits, (which grounds the principle of fidelity, to keep\none\u2019s promises and commitments. (TJ \u00a7\u00a718, 52).\n\nThe Priority Principles: the principles of justice are ranked\nin lexical order. (a) The priority of liberty requires that basic\nliberties can only be restricted to strengthen the system of liberties\nshared by all. (b) Fair equality of opportunity is lexically prior to\nthe difference principle. (c) The second principle is prior to the\nprinciple of efficiency and maximizing the sum of advantages. (TJ\n302/266 rev.)\n\nThe General Conception of Justice: \u201cAll social\ngoods\u2014liberty and opportunity, income and wealth, and the bases\nof self-respect, are to be distributed equally unless an unequal\ndistribution of any or all of these goods is to the advantage of the\nleast favored.\u201d TJ 1971, 302. Note: The general conception is\nthe difference principle generalized to all primary goods (TJ 1971,\n83); it applies in non-ideal conditions where the priority of liberty\nand opportunity is not sustainable.\n",
