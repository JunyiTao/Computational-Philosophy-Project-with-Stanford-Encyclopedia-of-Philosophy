    "main_text": "\n1. Life and works\n\nDu Bos was born in Beauvais on 14 December 1670. Little is known of\nhis family or childhood. He was educated in Paris, where he received a\nMaster of Arts in 1688 and a Bachelor of Theology in 1692. Although\nlater in life he was a titular abb\u00e9 and canon, he seems to have\nhad little interest in the ecclesiastical life. He was more interested\nin politics and in the life of a man of letters and he soon moved in\nleading intellectual circles. His friends included Nicolas\nBoileau-D\u00e9spreaux, an important poet and literary critic,\nCharles Perrault, another major poet, and Pierre Bayle, the famous\nphilosopher. He was a friend of Jean Jacques-Rousseau though, as was\noften the case with Rousseau\u2019s friendships, the friendship did\nnot endure. Du Bos was particularly closely associated with Bayle, who\nhad an important impact on Du Bos\u2019s thought. Du Bos traveled\nextensively in Europe in his capacity as a diplomat and in order to\nmeet the leading intellectuals of the day. Lombard (1913) remains the\nstandard account of his life.\n\nDu Bos\u2019s first book was Histoire de Quatre Gordiens,\nprouv\u00e9e et illustr\u00e9e par les M\u00e9dailles\n(History of the Four Gordians, Proven and Illustrated by\nMedallions) (1695). In this work, he argued, on the basis of\nnumismatic evidence, that there had been four, not three Gordian\nemperors. His hypothesis was quickly refuted by historians.\n\nDu Bos worked as a diplomat and was involved in negotiating a peace\ntreaty between the Netherlands and France. In this connection, he\nwrote Les Interests de l\u2019Angleterre mal entendus dans la\nguerre pr\u00e9sente (England\u2019s Interests in the\nPresent War Misunderstood) (1703).\n\nHis next book was L\u2019Histoire de la Ligue de\nCambray (History of the League of Cambrai). This was a\nclear and engaging history of the alliance, including France,\nassembled by Pope Julius II to wage war against the Venetian Republic\nbetween 1508 and 1516. The book was praised by, among others,\nVoltaire.\n\nDu Bos travelled to England in 1698 to meet John Locke at the request\nof their mutual friend Nicolas Toinard. Toinard wanted advice on the\npreparation of a translation of Locke\u2019s Essay concerning\nHuman Understanding. Locke and Du Bos became close friends and\nLocke asked his French friend to review the French translation of the\nEssay. The influence of Locke\u2019s empiricism is evident\nthroughout the Critical Reflections.\n\nIn 1719 Du Bos published R\u00e9flexions critiques sur la\npo\u00e9sie et sur la peinture (Critical Reflections on\nPoetry and Painting), the book on which his posthumous reputation\ndepends. Further editions appeared in 1732, 1733, 1740, 1746, 1755,\n1760, and 1770. The work was significantly expanded and revised for\nthe 1740 and subsequent editions. It was translated into German,\nDutch, and English. Largely on the basis of the Critical\nReflections, Du Bos was elected to the Acad\u00e9mie\nfran\u00e7aise in 1720. He became perpetual secretary of the\nAcad\u00e9mie in 1723.\n\nDu Bos\u2019s final major work was the Histoire critique de\nl\u2019\u00e9tablissement de la monarchie fran\u00e7aise dans les\nGaules (Critical History of the Establishment of the French\nMonarchy in Gaul) (1734). The book\u2019s thesis is that the\nFranks did not conquer Gaul. Rather, according to Du Bos, the Gauls\ninvited them to become the rulers of what became France. The book won\nthe praise of many, including Edward Gibbon, but it was effectively\ncriticized by Montesquieu in The Spirit of the Laws.\n\nBy all accounts, Du Bos was a pleasant and charming man. Many\naffectionate remembrances were published in the wake of his death on\n23 March 1742.\n2. Critical Reflections on Poetry and Painting\n\nCritical Reflections on Poetry and Painting begins with an\ninvestigation of the \u201cstriking pleasure (94)\u201d that humans\nreceive from the experience of poetry and painting. (All references to\nthe Critical Reflections are to pages of Du Bos 1719/2021.)\nThe book focuses on the two fine arts mentioned in the book\u2019s\ntitle, but Du Bos also discusses sculpture, engraving, dance, and\nmusic. According to Du Bos, we receive pleasure from the fine arts\nbecause works of art are imitations of objects in the world.\nPresumably, on Du Bos\u2019s view, the similarity between imitations\nand the objects imitated is responsible for the arousal of emotion.\nWhen we experience imitations, we receive emotions similar to, but\nless intense than, the emotions we feel when we experience the objects\nimitated. If these emotions are pleasing, Du Bos has an account of the\npleasure that humans receive from experience of the fine arts.\n\nDu Bos\u2019s account of the striking pleasure that we receive from\nthe fine arts commits him to the ancient view that the fine arts are\nimitative arts. This view is traceable to Plato and Aristotle and Du\nBos acknowledges these ancient sources. Although the view that the\nfine arts make up a coherent \u2018system\u2019 is sometimes\nattributed to Charles Batteux (Kristeller 1951; 1952), Du Bos\u2019s\nviews clearly anticipate those of Batteux (Young 2015).\n\nAccording to Du Bos, all arts are imitative, but the arts do not all\nrepresent in the same way. In the course of the Critical\nReflections, Du Bos makes a contribution to philosophy of\nlanguage by distinguishing between natural signs and the artificial\nsigns found in language. Natural signs, such as those found in\npainting, sculpture, and music, represent because they resemble their\nobjects. The artificial signs of language are arbitrary or\nconventional. They are employed in poetry (that is, literature).\n\nDu Bos asks which of the arts is best able to arouse emotions. He\nbelieves that painting has an advantage over poetry on the grounds\nthat natural signs affect us more effectively. He argues, however,\nthat poetry when combined with music or acting (or both, as in opera)\nhas an advantage over painting.\n\nDu Bos is aware that his account of the pleasure we receive from art\nfaces a serious objection. When the emotions we receive from viewing\nan imitation are positive, Du Bos\u2019s account has a prima facie\nplausibility. Sometimes, however, as he recognizes, we receive\nunpleasant emotions from the experience of artistic imitations. Du Bos\nconsiders, for example, an imitation of the sacrifice of\nJephthah\u2019s daughter and Le Brun\u2019s painting, Massacre\nof the Innocents. These works arouse negative emotions.\nNevertheless, we willingly, even enthusiastically, experience the\nworks. Our willingness to experience works that arouse negative\nemotions is often referred to as the paradox of tragedy.\n\nDu Bos tries to resolve the paradox by making two points. He begins by\nsaying that, although imitations of unpleasant events will arouse\nunpleasant emotions, these emotions are not as intense or as enduring\nas we receive from experience of the events themselves. This point\ncannot, by itself, resolve the paradox. Du Bos\u2019s second point is\nthat although the emotions aroused by imitations of unpleasant events\nare unpleasant, they are preferable to an emotion that we would\notherwise feel. According to Du Bos, we are constitutionally subject\nto a feeling of deep ennui. This ennui is not merely boredom. Rather\nit is a weariness of the human condition.\n\nIn \u2018On Tragedy,\u2019 Hume endorses Du Bos\u2019s solution to\nthe paradox, at least up to a point. Hume notes that, according to Du\nBos, \u201cnothing is in general so disagreeable to the mind as the\nlanguid, listless state of indolence, into which it falls upon the\nremoval of all passion and occupation.\u201d Hume then adds that,\nwhen a work of tragic art arouses an emotion \u201cLet it be\ndisagreeable, afflicting, melancholy, disordered; it is still better\nthan\u2026insipid languor\u201d (Hume 1757, 217). Some contemporary\nphilosophers have also found merit in Du Bos\u2019s approach to the\nparadox of tragedy (Livingston 2013).\n\nLater in the Critical Reflections Du Bos returns to the\nparadox of tragedy and gives a rather different solution. This later\npassage is apparently influenced by Aristotle\u2019s Poetics\nsince Du Bos speaks of the purging of emotions. He means by this,\nhowever, something other than Aristotle meant. According to Du Bos,\n\u201cThe faithful depiction of the passions suffices to make us\nafraid and make us resolve to avoid them with all of the determination\nof which we are capable\u201d (318). For example, we watch a\nperformance of Medea and we are horrified by the passion for\nvengeance and resolve not to indulge in it.\n\nThe concept of sentiments is crucial to Du Bos\u2019s thought. He\nseems to have been the writer who made talk of sentiments so\ncommonplace in eighteenth-century aesthetics. Du Bos never precisely\ndefines what he means when he speaks of sentiments. In what is,\nperhaps, the closest he comes to a definition he writes that,\n\u201cThe first ideas born in the soul, when it receives a lively\nstimulus,\u2026we call sentiments\u201d (237). According\nto Du Bos, sentiments are not produced by a special sort of aesthetic\nexperience. Rather, they are, as already indicated, ordinary emotional\nresponses. We can receive sentiments from experience of ordinary\nobjects and from experience of the imitations found in art. The\ndifference, as already noted, is that sentiments produced by art are\nfainter.\n\nDespite believing that sentiments are ordinary emotions or fainter\ncopies of them, Du Bos posits a sense of beauty. He writes that,\n\u201cWe have in us a sense intended to judge the value of works that\nimitate touching objects in nature\u201d and calls this a\n\u201csixth sense\u201d (519). Du Bos compares the sense of beauty\nto gustatory taste and seems to have been among the first writers to\ndo so.\n\nSince artistic imitations are intended to arouse emotions similar to\nthose aroused by the objects imitated, Du Bos values what he calls\nvraisemblance (verisimilitude). Painters, for example, must\n\u201cmake a painting consistent with what we know of the customs,\nhabits, architecture, and arms of the people that one intends to\nrepresent\u201d (226). A work can, however, be vraisemblable\nwithout being an imitation of the real world and historical events. A\nwork can be vraisemblable and yet be an example of what Du\nBos calls \u201cthe marvelous\u201d. An opera, for example, can be\nvraisemblable even though it depicts marvelous ancient Greek\ngods and goddesses. It must, however, depict them as existing in a way\nthat gods and goddesses can exist. Vraisemblance is not an\nend in itself as it was for some earlier thinkers. The real goal of\nthe arts is to arouse sentiments and vraisemblance is only a\nmeans of doing so.\n\nAccording to Du Bos, we judge artworks by means of our sentiments\nrather than by means of reason. He rejects the rationalist school of\ncriticism associated with writers such as Roland Fr\u00e9art de\nChambray (1606\u201476), the author of L\u2019Id\u00e9e de la\nperfection de la peinture demonstr\u00e9e par les principles de\nl\u2019art (1662) and Jean Terrasson, whose work\nDissertation critique sur l\u2019Iliade d\u2019Homere\nappeared in 1715. Terrasson wrote that the \u201cproper and natural\nprinciple by which we must judge a work of literature [belles\nlettres] is the real conformity that it must have with good\nreason and belle nature; this is philosophy\u201d (Terrason\n1715, iv). He adds that this philosophy comes from Descartes and\n\u201cthe spirit of our philosophy is not limited to works of natural\nscience [physique]; the pulpit, the courts and even poetry\nfeel it\u2026.[modern philosophy] submits everything to\nreason\u201d (Terrason 1715, lxi). In a similar vein, Bosse wrote\nthat the \u201cnoble art of painting must be based for the\nmost part on correct and rule-governed reasoning, which is to say,\ngeometrical and, consequently, demonstrative\u201d (Bosse 1649,\nsommaire). Du Bos mocks these writers as \u2018geometrical\ncritics.\u2019\n\nHe writes that the evaluation of art \u201cis not left to reason. It\nmust submit to the judgement that sentiment pronounces. Sentiment is\nthe competent judge of this issue.\u201d He goes on to compare the\nevaluation of an artwork to making a judgement about a ragout. Reason\nis of no use here. Rather, \u201cWe taste the ragout and\u2026we\nknow that it is good. It is the same with works of wit and pictures\nmade to please us by touching us\u201d (519).\n\nIn making sentiments the means by which artworks are judged, Du Bos\ngave rise to a question that he did not fully appreciate and certainly\ndid not solve. This is the question of providing a standard of taste.\nDu Bos is a subjectivist. He makes the value of an artwork a\nresponse-dependent property. A work of art is valuable if it arouses\ncertain valuable sentiments in audience members. Du Bos was aware that\ndifferent works will arouse different pleasing sentiments in different\npeople:\n\nTo want to persuade a man who prefers colour to expression, in\naccordance with his own feelings, that he is wrong, is to want to\npersuade him to take more pleasure in seeing Poussin\u2019s paintings\nthan Titian\u2019s. The matter depends no more on him than it does on\na man, whose palate is formed in such a way as to prefer champagne to\nSpanish wine, to change his taste and prefer the Spanish wine to\nFrench (345).\n\n\nThe problem, as Hume clearly recognized, was that not everyone\nreceives the same sentiments from a work of art. This leads to the\nconclusion that a work has value for some people and not for others.\nHowever, as Hume also recognized, thorough-going subjectivism is\ncounterintuitive. It seems that there is a fact that Milton is a\ngreater poet than Ogilby, even if some people prefer Ogilby.\n\nDu Bos was unaware of the full extent of the problem caused by\nsubjectivism. Likely this was because he believed that everyone has\nvery much the same sentiments. In fact, he believed that the general\npublic was the best judge of the value of artworks because their taste\nwas least corrupted by prejudice.\n\nDu Bos also proposes the test of time. When a work of art repeatedly\npleases audiences over a long period of time, this is conclusive\nevidence that it is a work of high value. Du Bos point out, for\nexample, that the reputations of the best Greek and Roman poets are\nfirmly established since they have pleased audiences through the\nages.\n\nSome writers, Du Bos was aware, believe that artworks can be valuable\nas a source of knowledge. At times Du Bos indicates that there is\nsomething to this, and that art is valuable as more than the source of\nvaluable sentiments. In the end, however, his considered opinion is\nthat, \u201cWe can acquire some knowledge by reading a poem, but this\nis scarcely the motive for opening the book\u201d (244).\n\nDu Bos speaks about audience members\u2019 states of mind but he also\nspeaks of the artist\u2019s state of mind. Artists, he believes, feel\nthe emotions that their works arouse in audience members. Indeed, the\nartist\u2019s \u201cgoal is to make us share his sentiments\u201d\n(354). The difference between the artist\u2019s state of mind, and\nthose of audience members, is that the artist\u2019s sentiments are\nmore intense. Artists must be in a state of \u201centhusiasm\u201d\nif they are to create successful works of art. This enthusiasm can\nborder on madness. Since Du Bos believes that artists convey their\nemotions to their audiences, he is an early advocate of an expression\ntheory of the arts.\n\nThe Critical Reflections make a contribution to the Quarrel\nof the Ancients and Moderns. This was a long running debate about the\nrelative merits of ancient and modern writers and artists. Du\nBos\u2019s contribution to the debate is judicious. He reaches the\nconclusion that modern sculptors have not surpassed their ancient\ncounterparts. With regard to painting, he says that it is difficult to\nreach a judgement since so few ancient paintings have survived.\nNevertheless, he thinks it unlikely that modern painters have\nsurpassed the ancients. Ancient poets have a significant edge over\nmodern ones. Du Bos allows that, in the natural sciences, modern\nscientists have eclipsed the ancients.\n\nMuch of Du Bos\u2019s book is devoted to an explanation of artistic\ngenius. He is particularly concerned to explain why certain eras (the\nGolden Age of Athens, the Rome of Augustus, the Italian Renaissance,\nand the era of Louis XIV) are more productive of geniuses. Although Du\nBos says, in passing, that a \u201cpoet needs divine\ninspiration\u201d (241), he decisively rejects the Platonic\nconception of genius. Instead, he believes that genius has physical\ncauses. In part, genius is to be explained by physiological\nconsiderations. According to Du Bos, a genius has a well-formed brain\nand other physiological advantages over other people. Most\nimportantly, he believes, genius is the result of certain\nenvironmental factors. These factors include climate, air quality,\nsoil, and diet. For example, England is supposedly unable to produce\npainters of the first rank because the climate is too cold. Although\nhighly influential in the eighteenth century, Du Bos\u2019s views on\ngenius have been supplanted. Nevertheless, Du Bos\u2019s views on\ngenius are noteworthy as an early effort to provide a scientific\nexplanation of genius.\n\nAlthough Du Bos was primarily concerned with poetry and painting, he\nmade a significant contribution to philosophy of music. He was an\nadvocate of the resemblance theory of musical expression. According to\nthis theory, music is expressive of emotions because it resembles\nhuman expressive behavior. This view is found, in the contemporary\nworld, in Davies (1994) and Kivy (1980). (See the article on\nPhilosophy of Music, 3.1.) Music can resemble either vocal or\nnon-vocal expressive behavior. It can resemble, for example, the\nplodding steps of a sad person or the joyful cries of a happy one.\nBecause music resembles such expressive behavior, it is heard as sad,\njoyful, or expressive of some other emotion.\n\nIn the Critical Reflections, the resemblance theory is\ncrucial in explaining how music can be, like painting and poetry, an\nimitative art. It does so by resembling and, consequently, imitating\n\u201cnatural signs of the passions\u201d. Du Bos also believes that\nmusic can imitate sounds in nature. He writes that \u201cThere is\ntruth in a symphony, composed to imitate a tempest, when the music of\nthe symphony, its harmony and its rhythm, make us hear a noise similar\nto the tumult of the wind and the roaring waves, which clash with each\nother or break against the rocks\u201d (323). (Here the word\n\u2018symphony\u2019 means instrumental music. It does not refer to\na symphony in the modern sense of the word.) Notice that, on Du\nBos\u2019s view, even purely instrumental music can be imitative.\n\nUnlike some modern advocates of the resemblance theory, Du Bos\nbelieves that the experience of musical imitations arouses emotion.\nMusic arouses emotions in very much the same way that poetry and\npainting do. The emotion aroused will be the emotion that would be\naroused by the object represented.\n\nDu Bos\u2019s prose is often execrable. Voltaire wrote, with\nreference to Du Bos and the Critical Reflections, that,\n\u201cthe judgement is good, the style bad. It is necessary to read\nhim, but re-reading him would be tiresome\u201d (Voltaire\nCorrespondence, letter 3917). An English translation of the\nCritical Reflections was published in the eighteenth century.\nThomas Nugent translated the book as Critical Reflections on\nPoetry, Painting and Music (Du Bos 1748). Unfortunately, this\ntranslation is inaccurate and preserves all of the problems of the\noriginal French. A new translation (Du Bos 1719/2021) recently\nappeared. \n3. Du Bos\u2019s impact on the development of aesthetics\n\nNo single person deserves to be credited as the inventor of modern\naesthetics. Several figures in the early eighteenth century\nindependently made contributions to criticism and philosophy that\nwould become modern aesthetics. In England, Shaftesbury\u2019s\nCharacteristicks of Men, Manners, Opinions, and Times (1711)\nand Joseph Addison\u2019s Pleasures of the Imagination\n(1712) laid some of the groundwork for aesthetics. On the Continent,\nJean-Pierre de Crousaz\u2019s Trait\u00e9 de beau (1715)\nand Christian Wolff\u2019s Rational Thoughts on God, the World,\nand the Soul of Man (1720) were pioneering contributions to\naesthetics. All of these works appeared in the second decade of the\neighteenth century, as did Du Bos\u2019s Critical\nReflections. Du Bos deserves to be recognized as among the\noriginators of modern aesthetics and philosophy of art. His importance\nwas widely recognized in the eighteenth century. Johann Georg Sulzer,\nin his General Theory of the Fine Arts (1771\u201374)\ndescribed Du Bos as \u201cthe first of modern critics to construct a\ntheory of art upon general principles\u201d (Baker and Christensen\n1995, 25).\n\nThe influence of Du Bos on aesthetics in France began with his impact\non Voltaire (Williams 1966). He described Du Bos as \u201ca very\nwise, very learned, and very esteemed man\u201d and, according to\nVoltaire, \u201cAll artists read with profit his Reflections\non poetry, painting, and music\u201d (Voltaire 1877\u201385, vol. 3,\n10; vol. 14, 66). Du Bos\u2019s influence is found at a number of\npoints in Voltaire\u2019s writings. He adopts Du Bos\u2019s\nsubjectivism, writing that, \u201cIn order to judge poets, it is\nnecessary to know how to feel\u201d (Voltaire 1877\u201385, vol. 8,\n319). Voltaire agreed with Du Bos that there have been four ages where\nthe arts particularly flourished and he agreed with Du Bos\u2019s\nassessment of which ages they have been. Voltaire also adopted one of\nDu Bos\u2019s controversial views: the belief that national character\nis affected by matters such as climate.\n\nDu Bos had a significant impact on the Encyclopaedia of\nDiderot and d\u2019Alembert. Louis, chevalier de Jaucourt was the\nauthor of many of this work\u2019s articles on the fine arts and he\ncites Du Bos in the articles on Painting, Modern Painting,\nInscription, Landscape Painting, and Landscape Painter. In fact, a\nlarge chunk of the article on Landscape Painting is lifted wholesale\nout of Critical Reflections, vol. 1, chapter\n6 (d\u2019Alembert et al. 2003).\n\nThe influence of Du Bos on Jean Jacques Rousseau has long since been\nestablished (Jones 1974). This influence is particularly apparent in\nthe Lettre \u00e0 mr d\u2019Alembert sur les spectacles\n(1758). Rousseau agrees with Du Bos that theatre does not aim to\narouse in audience members the sentiment that the characters\nrepresented feel. Rousseau agrees that, on the contrary, theatre\narouses quite opposed sentiments. For example, if a character in a\ntragedy is represented as feeling fear and despair, audience members\nwill have pity aroused in them.\n\nDu Bos seems to have been one of the important sources of the\nresemblance theory of musical expression in the eighteenth century.\nBatteux is known to have read the Critical Reflections and\nwas apparently influenced by Du Bos when he wrote that gestures and\nsounds are \u201cnatural means of expression\u201d that are\n\u201cespecially suited to the expression of emotion\u201d. He adds\nthat \u201cmusic is half-formed in the words that express some\nemotion. It takes only a little art to turn the words into music\n\u201d (Batteux 1746/2015, 129; 133). These passages from The\nFine Arts are little more than paraphrases of passages from the\nCritical Reflections.\n\nDu Bos had a significant influence on aesthetics in Britain. His\ninfluence is found, for example, in James Harris\u2019s Three\nTreatises, particularly in the second of these treatises,\n\u2018A Discourse on Music, Painting and Poetry\u2019 (Harris 1744).\nIn fact, this treatise is little more than a brief reprisal of central\nthemes from the Critical Reflections. Harris, like Du Bos,\ndistinguishes between the fine arts according to their means of\nexpression. Painting employs natural signs and poetry artificial ones.\nThey agree that this gives painting an advantage when it comes to the\narousal of emotion, but both believe that the power of poetry can be\nenhanced by music and staging to the point where it has the advantage\nover poetry. They agree that art owes its value to its capacity to\narouse sentiments.\n\nSince Jones (1982) it has been known that Du Bos had an impact on\nHume\u2019s thinking about art. Hume owned the 1732 edition of the\nCritical Reflections (Norton and Norton, 1996, 88). He must\nhave acquired it soon after his move to France to begin writing his\nTreatise.\n\nHume\u2019s discussion of Du Bos in \u2018Of Tragedy\u2019 has\nalready been noted, but Jones (1982) argues that Du Bos\u2019s\ninfluence is also apparent in \u2018Of the Standard of Taste\u2019.\nHume\u2019s views on art were influenced by several of his\ncontemporaries, including Francis Hutcheson, and it can be difficult\nto disentangle their contributions to his thought. (See the article on\nScottish Philosophy in the 18th Century, section 4 for a discussion of\nHutcheson\u2019s influence on Hume.) The difficulty is compounded by\nthe fact that the views of Hutcheson and Du Bos are similar in certain\nrespects. Nevertheless, Jones (1982) finds significance in the fact\nHume, like Du Bos, believed that we have an internal sense of beauty.\nBoth believe that this sense of beauty, not reason, is the means by\nwhich the beauty of work is determined. Moreover, there is an uncanny\nsimilarity between the ways in which they express these views. Du Bos,\nin the Critical Reflections, and Hume, in \u2018Of the\nStandard of Taste,\u2019 say that they are opposed to\n\u201cgeometrical\u201d criticism. Both believe that rules of\ncriticism can be given, but that they can be violated by great works\nof art. Both give Ariosto as an example of a poet who violates the\nrules of criticism.\n\nJones (1982) noted the impact of Du Bos on Hume\u2019s essays, but\ndid not remark on the impact of the Frenchman on Hume\u2019s\nTreatise. Norton and Norton, in their edition of the\nTreatise (Hume 1739\u201340 [2007]) noted some passages\nwhere Du Bos influenced Hume, but many more passages have recently\nbeen identified (Mazza and Mori 2016; Young and Cameron 2018).\nVirtually every passage in the Treatise where the fine arts\nare mentioned shows signs of Du Bos\u2019s influence. Young and\nCameron (2018) have argued that several passages in the\nTreatise so closely resemble passages in the Critical\nReflections that the similarity cannot be coincidental. For\nexample, both Du Bos and Hume agree that poetry and painting arouse\nthe same emotions that we feel in ordinary life, but that the emotions\naroused by the arts are fainter. Hume, like Du Bos, believes that\npassions that are displeasing when experienced in daily life can be\npleasing when aroused by art. A passage in the Treatise\n(2.2.4.4) refers to Du Bos\u2019s view that humans are plagued by\nennui and they seek to escape it by gaming and other activities. On\nthe other hand, Hume explicitly rejects Du Bos\u2019s view on the\ninfluence of climate on national character. Goldhaber (2021) argues\nthat Hume adopted a four humor psycholgy under the influence of Du\nBos. \n\nLombard (1913) judged that Du Bos\u2019s impact was greatest in\nGermany. Du Bos was responsible for a move away from a rationalist\napproach to criticism there as in France. His influence in Germany is\nfound as early as Johann Jakob Breitinger\u2019s Critische\nDichtkunst (1740). Subsequently, Baumgarten, Herder, Lessing,\nMendelssohn, and Winckelmann either adopted some of Du Bos\u2019s\nviews or argued against them. Lessing translated part of the\nCritical Reflections into German and was deeply influenced by\nhim. For a study of the relationship between Du Bos and Lessing see\nLeysaht (1874).\n4. Du Bos on epistemology and philosophy of science\n\nDu Bos\u2019s primary contributions to philosophy are in aesthetics\nbut he also contributed to the revolt against Cartesianism in France.\nCartesianism dominated French thinking about knowledge and science\nuntil well into the eighteenth century (Illiffe 2003, 269). Du\nBos\u2019s approach to philosophy of art was thoroughly empiricist\nand so was his attitude towards science. He deserves credit for\napplying Locke\u2019s empirical account of knowledge to scientific\nhypotheses.\n\nIn the first instance, Du Bos applied empiricism to the study of art,\nas we have seen. According to Du Bos, judgements of works of art must\nbe empirical. He writes that\n\nDo we use reason to determine whether a ragout is good or bad? Did you\never, after having applied geometrical principles to the flavour,\ndetermine the properties that each of the ingredients contributes, go\non to discuss the proportions preserved in their mixture, in order to\ndecide whether the ragout is good? You never have. We have a sense\nthat makes us recognize whether the cook has followed the rules of his\nart. We taste the ragout and, even without knowing these rules, we\nknow that it is good. It is the same with works of wit and pictures\nmade to please us by touching us (519).\n\n\nElsewhere Du Bos adds that\n\nif there is some matter where reason should fall silent in the face of\nexperience, it is certainly in questions that can be raised regarding\nthe value of a poem. It is when we want to know whether a poem is\npleasing or not; if, generally speaking, a poem is an excellent work\nor just average\u2026there are few general principles to rely on\nregarding the value of a poem (531).\n\n\nDu Bos stresses the importance of sentiments, that is, the feelings we\nhave in response to works of art.\n\nWhile Du Bos rejected rationalism in judgements about art, his\nempiricism did not end there. He was opposed to the a priori\nconstruction of scientific systems. He notes that\n\nThe two most famous philosophical organizations in Europe, the Academy\nof Sciences in Paris and the Royal Society in London, refuse to adopt\nor build a single general system of natural science. Agreeing with the\nview of Chancellor Bacon, they have espoused not a single one out of\nfear that having to justify it should draw attention from onlookers\nand make them see experiments not as they truly are, but as they\nshould be, in order to give weight to an opinion they try to pass off\nas true. Our two famous academies rest content to verify facts and\npublish them in their journals, persuaded that nothing is easier\naccording to reason and that they would stumble if they took two steps\nbeyond what they acquired from experience. These two organizations\nexpect a general system on the basis of first-hand\nexperience (527).\n\n\nIn another passage, Du Bos discusses Harvey\u2019s discovery of the\ncirculation of blood and makes clear that it could only have been\ndiscovered a posteriori. People have accepted Harvey\u2019s\nhypothesis, Du Bos writes, because\n\nthey know that it no longer relies on reasoning for its proof and that\nit is demonstrated by experience. To repeat, people have much more\nconfidence in those who tell them \u201cI have seen\u201d than in\nthose who tell them \u201cI have concluded\u201d (589).\n\n\nThis passage is clearly an endorsement of empiricism and a rejection\nof Cartesian rationalism.\n\nDu Bos makes a related claim in a discussion of physicians. A\nphysician may be a Cartesian while young, but he will end up as an\nempiricist. According to Du Bos,\n\nAt twenty-five, a doctor is as persuaded of the truth of his\nanatomical reasoning, which tries to discover the manner by which\ncinchona bark works to alleviate intermittent fevers, as he is by the\neffectiveness of the remedy. By age sixty, a doctor is persuaded by\nthe truth of a fact that he has seen multiple times, but he does not\nput any faith in the explanation of the effect of the remedy than\nby the piling up of examples, if it permitted to use that\nexpression. (530)\n\n\nExperience will transform the wise physician into an empiricist.\nElsewhere, Du Bos says something similar about engineering, navigation\nand related sciences. He considers four modern scientific discoveries\n(the discovery of air pressure, the invention of the compass, the\ndevelopment of the printing press, and the invention of the telescope)\nand observes that all of these discoveries were due to the acquisition\nof new experiences.\n\nWhen Du Bos investigates any scientific matter, he proceeds in an\nempirical fashion. For example, he examines the question of why\ncertain eras have produced more geniuses than other periods. He begins\nby considering the hypothesis that a social cause is responsible for\nthe production of geniuses. In particular, he considers the hypothesis\nthat the production of geniuses can be explained by reference to\ngenerous patrons. He refutes this hypothesis by giving examples of\neras when patrons abounded but geniuses were scarce. Having\nempirically refuted this hypothesis, he considers the hypothesis that\ngenius has a natural or physical cause. Du Bos supports this\nhypothesis by attempting to find a correlation between certain\nenvironmental, climatic, and dietary factors and the production of\ngenius. Du Bos\u2019s views on the origin of genius were widely\naccepted in the first two thirds of the eighteenth century. Herder,\nMontesquieu, Voltaire, and Winckelmann were among the important\nfigures to adopt Du Bos\u2019s views on climate and genius.\n\nDu Bos held that scientific investigation always involves some\nuncertainty. He wrote that \u201cI distrust physical explanations,\nsince the imperfection of this science almost always makes guesswork\nnecessary\u201d (362). According to Du Bos, a scientific hypothesis\nis only probable to some extent or another. He illustrates this view\nby reference to Harvey\u2019s hypothesis concerning the circulation\nof blood. Du Bos writes that, \u201cMost scholars of his\n[Harvey\u2019s] time were persuaded by his views. It was as firmly\nand widely established as a scientific truth as something that is not\ndirectly observed can be. That is, it was regarded as a view more\nprobable than the contrary opinion\u201d (588).\n",
