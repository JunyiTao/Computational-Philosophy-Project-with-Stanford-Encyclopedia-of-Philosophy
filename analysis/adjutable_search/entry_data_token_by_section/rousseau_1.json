    "main_text": "Conjectural history and moral psychology\n2. Conjectural history and moral psychology\n\nRousseau repeatedly claims that a single idea is at the centre of his\nworld view, namely, that human beings are good by nature but are\nrendered corrupt by society (see Melzer 1990; Cohen 2010, chapter 4).\nUnfortunately, despite the alleged centrality of this claim, it is\ndifficult to give it a clear and plausible interpretation. One obvious\nproblem is present from the start: since society, the supposed agent\nof corruption, is composed entirely of naturally good human beings,\nhow can evil ever get a foothold? It is also hard to see what\n\u201cnatural goodness\u201d might be. In various places Rousseau\nclearly states that morality is not a natural feature of human life,\nso whatever sense it is that human beings are good by nature, it is\nnot the moral one that the casual reader would naturally assume. In\norder, therefore, to address this puzzling central claim, it is best\nto look first at the details of Rousseau\u2019s moral psychology,\nespecially as developed in the Discourse on Inequality and in\nEmile.\n\nRousseau attributes to all creatures an instinctual drive towards\nself-preservation. Human beings therefore have such a drive, which he\nterms amour de soi (self love). Amour de soi directs\nus first to attend to our most basic biological needs for things like\nfood, shelter and warmth. Since, for Rousseau, humans, like other\ncreatures, are part of the design of a benevolent creator, they are\nindividually well-equipped with the means to satisfy their natural\nneeds. Alongside this basic drive for self-preservation, Rousseau\nposits another passion which he terms piti\u00e9\n(compassion). Piti\u00e9 directs us to attend to and\nrelieve the suffering of others (including animals) where we can do so\nwithout endangering our own self-preservation. In some of his\nwritings, such as the Discourse on Inequality,\npiti\u00e9 is an original drive that sits alongside\namour de soi, whereas in others, such as Emile and\nthe Essay on the Origin of Languages, it is a development of\namour de soi considered as the origin of all passions.\n\nIn the Discourse on Inequality Rousseau imagines a\nmulti-stage evolution of humanity from the most primitive condition to\nsomething like a modern complex society. Rousseau denies that this is\na reconstruction of history as it actually was, and Frederick\nNeuhouser (2014) has argued that the evolutionary story is merely a\nphilosophical device designed to separate the natural and the\nartificial elements of our psychology (for a contrasting view see\nKelly 2006). At each step of this imagined evolution human beings\nchange their material and psychological relations to one another and,\ncorrespondingly, their conception of themselves, or what Rousseau\ncalls the \u201csentiment of their existence.\u201d According to\nthis narrative, humans live almost entirely solitary lives in the\noriginal state of the human race, since they do not need one another\nto satisfy their material needs. The human race barely subsists in\nthis condition, chance meetings between proto-humans are the occasions\nfor copulation and reproduction, child-care is minimal and brief in\nduration. If humans are naturally good at this stage of human\nevolution, their goodness is merely a negative and amounts to the\nabsence of evil. In this story, human beings are distinguished from\nthe other creatures with which they share the primeval world only by\ntwo characteristics: freedom, and perfectibility. Freedom, in this\ncontext, is simply the ability not to be governed solely by appetite;\nperfectibility is the capacity to learn and thereby to find new and\nbetter means to satisfy needs. Together, these characteristics give\nhumans the potential to achieve self-consciousness, rationality, and\nmorality. Nevertheless, it will turn out that such characteristics are\nmore likely to condemn them to a social world of deception,\ndissimulation, dependence, oppression, and domination.\n\nAs human populations grow, simple but unstable forms of co-operation\nevolve around activities like hunting. According to Rousseau, the most\nimportant transitional moment in human history occurs at a stage of\nsociety marked by small settled communities. At this point a change,\nor rather a split, takes place in the natural drive humans have to\ncare for themselves: competition among humans to attract sexual\npartners leads them to consider their own attractiveness to others and\nhow that attractiveness compares to that of potential rivals. In\nEmile, where Rousseau is concerned with the psychological\ndevelopment of an individual in a modern society, he also associates\nthis new psychological feature with sexual competition and the moment,\npuberty, when the male adolescent starts to think of himself as a\nsexual being with rivals for the favours of girls and women.\n\nRousseau\u2019s term for this new type of self-interested drive,\nconcerned with comparative success or failure as a social being, is\namour propre (love of self, often rendered as pride or vanity\nin English translations). Amour propre make the need to be\nrecognized by others as having value and to be treated with respect\ncentral to the felt interests of each human being . The presentation\nof amour propre in the Discourse on\nInequality\u2014and especially in his note XV to that\nwork\u2014often suggests that Rousseau sees it as a wholly negative\npassion and the source of all evil. Interpretations of amour\npropre centered on the Discourse on Inequality (which,\nhistorically, are the most common ones (for example Charvet 1974)),\noften focus on the fact that the need for recognition always has a\ncomparative aspect, so that individuals are not content merely that\nothers acknowledge their value, but also seek to be esteemed as\nsuperior to them. This aspect of our nature then creates conflict as\npeople try to exact this recognition from others or react with anger\nand resentment when it is denied to them. More recent readings of both\nthe Discourse on Inequality, and especially of\nEmile, have indicated that a more balanced view is possible\n(Dent 1988, Neuhouser 2008, but see McLendon 2019 for pushback).\nAccording to these interpretations, amour propre is both the\ncause of humanity\u2019s fall as well as the promise of its\nredemption because of the way in which it develops humans\u2019\nrational capacities and their sense of themselves as social creatures\namong others. Although Rousseau held that the overwhelming tendency,\nsocially and historically, is for amour propre to take on\ntoxic and self-defeating (\u2018inflamed\u2019) forms, he also held\nthat there are, at least in principle, ways of organizing social life\nand individual education that allow it to take on a benign character.\nThis project of containing and harnessing amour propre finds\nexpression in both The Social Contract and Emile. In\nsome works, such as the Second Discourse, Rousseau presents\namour propre as a passion that is quite distinct from\namour de soi. In others, including Emile, he\npresents it as a form that amour de soi takes in a social\nenvironment. The latter is consistent with his view in Emile\nthat all the passions are outgrowths or developments of\namour de soi.\n\nAlthough amour propre has its origins in sexual competition\nand comparison within small societies, it does not achieve its full\ntoxicity until it is combined with a growth in material\ninterdependence among human beings. In the Discourse on\nInequality, Rousseau traces the growth of agriculture and\nmetallurgy and the first establishment of private property, together\nwith the emergence of inequality between those who own land and those\nwho do not. In an unequal society, human beings who need both the\nsocial good of recognition and such material goods as food, warmth,\netc. become enmeshed in social relations that are inimical both to\ntheir freedom and to their sense of self worth. Subordinates need\nsuperiors in order to have access to the means of life; superiors need\nsubordinates to work for them and also to give them the recognition\nthey crave. In such a structure there is a clear incentive for people\nto misrepresent their true beliefs and desires in order to attain\ntheir ends. Thus, even those who receive the apparent love and\nadulation of their inferiors cannot thereby find satisfaction for\ntheir amour propre. This trope of misrepresentation and\nfrustration receives its clearest treatment in Rousseau\u2019s\naccount of the figure of the European minister, towards the end of the\nDiscourse on Inequality, a figure whose need to flatter\nothers in order to secure his own wants leads to his alienation from\nhis own self.\n",
