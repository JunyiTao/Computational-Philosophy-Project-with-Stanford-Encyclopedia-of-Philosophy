    "main_text": "Liberty\n4. Liberty\n\nPrice distinguishes four different sorts of liberty all of which, he\nclaims, have a common theme.\n\n\n Physical liberty is \u201cthat principle of\nspontaneity, or self-determination, which constitutes us agents, or\nwhich gives us a command over our actions, rendering them properly\nours, and not effects of the operation of any foreign cause\u201d (P\n21\u20132).\n Moral liberty \u201cis the power of following, in all\ncircumstances, our sense of right and wrong, or of acting in\nconformity to our reflecting and moral principles, without being\ncontrouled by any contrary principles\u201d (P 22)\n Religious liberty \u201cis the power of exercising,\nwithout molestation, that mode of religion which we think best\u201d\n(P 22)\n Civil liberty \u201cis the power of a civil society\n\u2026 to govern itself by its own discretion, or by laws of its own\nmaking\u201d (P 22).\n\n\n\nThe first two concern the issue of free will and moral responsibility;\nthe second two concern issues of political governance. Nevertheless,\nPrice contends, they are all forms of liberty because \u201cthere is\none general idea that runs through them all; \u2026 the idea of\nself-direction or self-government\u201d (P 22)\n",
