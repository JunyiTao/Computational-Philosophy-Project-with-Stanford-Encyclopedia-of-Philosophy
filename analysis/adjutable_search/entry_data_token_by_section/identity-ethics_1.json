    "main_text": "Contemporary Accounts of Personal Identity\n2. Contemporary Accounts of Personal Identity\n\n\nThere are four general accounts of personal identity that have been\ntaken to have some relevance to ethics by contemporary theorists:\npsychological, biological, narrative, and a new one to be labeled\n\u201canthropological.\u201d After discussing these four, as well as\na fifth view that identity doesn't matter for ethics, we will evaluate\nthe views in light of a challenging thought experiment: fission. After\nthat, we will discuss the relevance of both souls and a\nfour-dimensionalist ontology to the issues at hand.\n",
