    "main_text": "Second Kind of Position in Feminist Environmental Philosophy: Ecofeminist Philosophy || Oppressive Conceptual Frameworks\n3.2 Oppressive Conceptual Frameworks\nA conceptual framework is a set of basic beliefs, values,\nattitudes, and assumptions that shape and reflect how one sees oneself\nand one's world (Warren 2000, 2005). Some conceptual frameworks\nare oppressive. An oppressive conceptual framework is one\nthat functions to explain, maintain, and \u201cjustify\u201d\ninstitutions, relationships and practices of unjustified domination\nand subordination. When an oppressive conceptual framework\nis patriarchal, it functions to justify the subordination of\nwomen by men.\nSexism, racism, classism, heterosexism, and ethnocentrism are\nexamples of what Warren calls unjustified \u201cisms of\ndomination\u201d (1990, 2000). Warren argues that these isms of\ndomination share conceptual roots in five features of an oppressive\nconceptual framework. The first feature is value-hierarchical,\nUp-Down thinking that attributes greater value to that which is\n\u201cUp\u201d than to that which is \u201cDown\u201d. In\ncanonical philosophy, value hierarchical thinking (typically) puts men Up and\nwomen Down, culture Up and nature Down. By attributing greater value\nto that which is higher, the Up-Down organization of reality serves to\nlegitimate inequality \u201cwhen, in fact, prior to the metaphor of\nUp-Down, one would have said only that there existed diversity\u201d\n(Elizabeth Dodson Gray 1981: 20)\n\n\nThe second feature is oppositional (rather than\ncomplementary) and mutually exclusive (rather than\ninclusive) value dualisms, which place greater value (status,\nprestige) on one disjunct over the other. In canonical Western\nphilosophy, the dualisms of male versus female and culture versus\nnature have historically done this; they have ascribed greater value\nto that which is identified with males or culture than to that which\nis identified with females or nature.  According to these value\ndualisms, it is better to be male or culture-identified than to be\nfemale or nature-identified.\nThe third and fourth features of oppressive conceptual frameworks\nare that they conceive of power and privilege in\nways that systematically advantage the Ups over the Downs (whether or\nnot the Ups choose to exercise that power and privilege). In a\nclassist society, wealthy people have the power and privilege to\nmobilize resources to self-determined ends. Sometimes this power and\nprivilege enables the wealthy to not notice the ways socioeconomic\nstatus is a significant challenge to equality of opportunity. For\nexample, poor people may be viewed as inferior, and thereby\nundeserving of the same opportunities or rights of the wealthy, often\non the grounds that their poverty is \u201ctheir own\nfault\u201d.\nThe fifth and philosophically most important feature of an\noppressive conceptual framework is the \u201clogic of\ndomination\u201d. This is the moral premise that superiority\njustifies subordination. The logic of domination provides the\n(alleged) moral justification for keeping Downs down. Typically this\njustification takes the form that the Up has some characteristic\n(e.g., reason) that the Down lacks and by virtue of which the\nsubordination of the Down by the Up is justified.\nNote that it is possible to have the first four features of an\noppressive conceptual framework yet not have a case of\noppression or unjustified domination. For example, responsible parents\nmay exercise legitimate power and privilege over their children (such\nas the power to decide when to put their child to bed or have the\nprivilege to drive), without thereby being involved in any sort of\noppressive parent-child relationship. Parent-child relationships are\nonly oppressive if the logic of domination is in place; it is what\nprovides the (alleged) justification for treating children as inferior\nand justifiably dominated.\nWarren argues that the five features of an oppressive conceptual\nframework spotlight some of the shared conceptual roots of the\nunjustified dominations of women, nonhuman animals, and nature. Many\necofeminist philosophers explore the ways these shared conceptual\nroots function in real life to keep intact unjustified institutions\nand practices of oppression and domination.\n",
