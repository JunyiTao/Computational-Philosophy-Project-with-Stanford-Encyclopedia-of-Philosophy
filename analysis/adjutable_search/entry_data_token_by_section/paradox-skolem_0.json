    "main_text": "Background\n1. Background\n\n\nTo understand Skolem's Paradox, we need to start by recalling two\ntheorems from classical\n logic.[1]\n The first comes from the late 19th century. In\n1873, Georg Cantor formulated a new technique for measuring the\nsize\u2014or cardinality\u2014of a set of objects. Cantor's\nidea was that two sets should have the same cardinality just in case\ntheir members can be put into one-to-one correspondence with each\nother. So, for instance, the set {1, 2, \u2026 , 26} can be put into\none-to-one correspondence with the set {A, B,\n\u2026 , Z } via the natural map which relates 1 to\nA, 2 to B, 3 to C, etc., etc.; similarly,\nthe set of natural numbers can be put into one-to-one correspondence\nwith the set of even numbers via the map: x\n\n 2x.\n\n\nWhen Cantor applied this conception of cardinality to infinite sets,\nhe came to the initially surprising conclusion that there are different\nkinds of infinity. There are relatively small infinite sets like the\nset of even numbers, the set of integers, or the set of rational\nnumbers. These sets can all be put into one-to-one correspondence with\nthe natural numbers; they are called countably infinite. In\ncontrast, there are much \u201clarger\u201d infinite sets like the\nset of real numbers, the set of complex numbers, or the set of all\nsubsets of the natural numbers. These sets are too big to be put into\none-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers; they are called\nuncountably infinite. Cantor's Theorem, then, is just the\nclaim that there are uncountably infinite sets\u2014sets which are, as\nit were, too big to count as\n countable.[2]\n\n\nOur second theorem comes from the early 20th century. In 1915,\nLeopold L\u00f6wenheim proved that if a first-order sentence has a\nmodel, then it has a model whose domain is\n countable.[3]\n In 1922, Thoralf Skolem\ngeneralized this result to whole sets of sentences. He proved that if a\ncountable collection of first-order sentences has an infinite model,\nthen it has a model whose domain is only countable. This is the result\nwhich typically goes under the name the L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem\nTheorem. Before moving on, it is useful to mention three, somewhat\nmore refined, versions of this\n theorem.[4]\n\n\nLet T be a countable collection of first-order sentences\nand let A be an infinite set. The Upward\nL\u00f6wenheim-Skolem Theorem says that if T has\nany infinite model, then T has a model whose domain\nhas the same size as A (indeed, we can assume without loss of\ngenerality that the domain of this second model just is\nA).[5]\nThe Downward L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem Theorem says that if\nN is a model of (infinite) cardinality \u03ba and if \u03bb is\nan infinite cardinal smaller than than \u03ba, then N has a\nsubmodel of cardinality \u03bb which satisfies exactly the same\nsentences as N itself\n does.[6]\n Finally, the Transitive\nSubmodel Theorem strengthens the downward L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem\ntheorem by saying that if our initial N happens to be\na so-called transitive model for the language of set theory,\nthen the submodel generated by the downward theorem can also be chosen\nto be\n transitive.[7]\n\n\nReturn, now, to the original version of the L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem\ntheorem\u2014the one which simply claimed that any theory which has\nan infinite model also has a model which is countably\ninfinite. Skolem's Paradox arises when we notice that the\nstandard axioms of set theory can themselves be formulated as\n(countable) collection of first-order sentences. If these axioms have a\nmodel at all, therefore, then the L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorem ensures\nthat they have a model with a countable\n domain.[8]\n But this seems quite\npuzzling. How can the very axioms which prove Cantor's theorem on the\nexistence of uncountable sets be satisfied by a model which is itself\nonly countable? How can a countable model satisfy the first-order\nsentence which \u201csays that\u201d there are uncountably many\nthings?\n\n\nThese questions can be made somewhat more concrete by considering a\nspecific case. Let T be a standard, first-order axiomatization\nof set theory. (For convenience, this entry will focus on the case\nwhere T is ZFC, but any standard axiomatization of set theory\nwould do equally well.) On the assumption that T has a model,\nthe L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorems ensure that it has a countable\nmodel. Call this model M. Now, as T\n \u22a2\u00a0\u2203x\u00a0\u201cx is\nuncountable,\u201d there must be some\n m\u02c6 \u2208\nM such that M\n \u22a8\u00a0\u201cm\u02c6\nis\nuncountable.\u201d But, as M itself is only\ncountable, there are only countably many m \u2208\nM such that M\n \u22a8\u00a0m \u2208\n m\u02c6 On the surface,\nthen, we seem to have a straightforward contradiction: from one\nperspective,\n m\u02c6 looks uncountable, while from another\nperspective,\n m\u02c6 is clearly countable.\n\n\nThis, then, gives us a fairly simple formulation of Skolem's\nParadox. Before turning to look at this paradox's solution, a point\nabout motivation is probably in order. From one perspective, there's\nnothing especially surprising about the fact that a particular\nmodel fails to accurately capture every feature of the reality of which\nit is a model. A mathematical model of a physical theory, for instance,\nmay contain only real numbers and sets of real numbers, even though the\ntheory itself concerns, say, subatomic particles and regions of\nspace-time. Similarly, a tabletop model of the solar system will get\nsome things right about the solar system while getting other things\nquite wrong. So, for instance, it may get the relative sizes of the\nplanets right while getting their absolute sizes (or even their\nproportional sizes) wrong; or it may be right about the fact that the\nplanets move around the sun, while being wrong about the mechanism of\nthis motion (e.g., the planets don't really move around the sun because\nsome demonstrator turns a crank!). Given all this, it may be unclear\nwhy we should even expect first-order models of set theory to\naccurately capture the distinction between countable and uncountable\nsets. Hence, it may be unclear why we should even think that Skolem's\nParadox looks paradoxical in the first place.\n\n\nAlthough we'll say more about this kind of issue later (see\nespecially sections\n 2.1\n and\n 3.1),\na few preliminary remarks are appropriate here. First, it's important\nto note that there are some set-theoretic concepts which\nfirst-order models do capture quite precisely. As we'll see in\nsection 3.1, first-order models capture finite cardinality\nnotions\u2014e.g., \u201cx is empty,\u201d\n\u201cx has two members,\u201d \u201cx has\nseventeen members,\u201d etc.\u2014quite nicely.[9]\n If we\nallow ourselves to use infinitely many formulas, then we can also\ncapture the more-general notion \u201cx is\n infinite.\u201d[10]\n Finally, if we fix our understanding of\nmembership\u2014i.e., if we restrict our attention to models which use\nthe real membership relation to interpret the symbol\n\u201c\u2208\u201d\u2014then we can also capture the general notion\n\u201cx is\n finite.\u201d[11]\n\n\nGiven all this, Skolem's Paradox shows that the line between\ncountable and uncountable sets is, in a fairly deep sense, the\nfirst place where our model theory loses the ability to\ncapture cardinality notions. This fact helps to explain why Skolem's\nParadox may continue to look paradoxical even after we've absorbed the\ngeneral points about models and model theory which were presented in\nthe second-to-last paragraph. In short: it's the very fact that we\ncan capture so many of the cardinality notions which live, as\nit were, below the countable/uncountable distinction which\nmakes our sudden inability to capture the countable/uncountable\ndistinction itself so initially surprising.\n\n\nSecond, Skolem's Paradox does not depend on the specific\naxiomatization of set theory that we happen to be working with.\nAny first-order axiomatization of set theory can have the\nL\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorems applied to it, so every such\naxiomatization is subject to Skolem's Paradox. This means, in\nparticular, that we can't resolve the paradox by simply choosing a new\naxiomatization of set theory (or adding some new axioms to the\naxiomatization that we're already using). The fact that Skolem's\nparadox is, in this way, intrinsic to the first-order\ncontext\u2014that it is an inescapable fact about first-order\naxiomatizations of set theory\u2014is another reason why Skolem's\nParadox may seem so initially puzzling.\n\n\nThis, then, gives us a first pass at formulating Skolem's Paradox.\nIn the next section, we explain why this simple version of the paradox\ndoesn't constitute a genuine contradiction, and we look at several\nmore-refined formulations of the paradox. In section\n 3,\n we turn to historical and philosophical issues. Section\n 3.1\n looks at Skolem's own understanding of his paradox.\nSections\n 3.2\u20133.4 look at\nsome more-recent attempts to argue that, even though the paradox\ndoesn't constitute a genuine mathematical contradiction, it still tells\nus something philosophically important about the nature of our\nunderstanding of set theory.\n",
