    "main_text": "Sense-datum theories || Problems for sense-datum theories\n2.2 Problems for sense-datum theories\n\nThe most important strength of sense-datum theories is that they are\ntailor-made for the peculiarities of pain experiences as well as other\nintransitive bodily sensations that we have discussed above. Indeed,\nthese theories seem to take the naive, perhaps somewhat confused but\nintuitive understanding of pain embedded in common sense and turn it\ninto a full-fledged philosophical theory supported on a general and\nindependent platform about what perception involves. In other words,\nthese theories seem to vindicate the act-object duality embedded in\ncommon-sense conception of pain.\n\nThere is irony in this. The irony is that sense-datum theories find\ntheir most natural home in intransitive bodily sensations like pain\nthat have been traditionally and historically contrasted with\nstandard exteroceptual experiences rather than co-classified\nwith them (for many, feeling pain is not a perceptual affair at all).\nThis is ironic for two reasons. First, the main proponents of\nsense-datum theories advanced these theories mainly as theories of\nexteroception, that is, perception of external physical reality.\nSecond, when applied to standard exteroception, sense-datum theories\ndon\u2019t seem to support the perceptual direct (naive) realism of\ncommon sense at all. Indeed, according to common sense, when I see a\nred apple on the table, I am directly seeing the apple (at least its\nsurface facing me) and its qualities like its redness. In short,\nalthough sense-datum theories that are explicitly advanced as theories\nof perception (exteroception) in general don\u2019t generate much\nconviction, they seem to be more convincing when applied to\nintransitive bodily sensations like pains that have not been\nusually thought to be perceptual.\n\nDespite the clash with common sense, various philosophers have\nadvanced powerful arguments for sense-datum theories about\nwhat perception in general involves (Moore 1903, 1939; Russell 1912;\nPrice 1950; Broad 1959; Jackson 1977, among others). There are also\npowerful arguments against sense-datum theories. Both sorts\nof arguments tend to be general arguments not directly related to\npain, so we won\u2019t cover them here (but see the entry on\n sense-data).\n Whatever the fate of sense-datum theories might be as general\ntheories of exteroception, their appeal as a model for understanding\npains and other intransitive bodily sensations is very strong. Indeed,\nas noted before, introspection seems to be the right mode of access\ninvolved in pain. So even if one finds the anti-sense-datum arguments\nconvincing and rejects indirect realism of this kind for standard\nexteroception, there may still be room for adopting a sense-datum\ntheory for intransitive bodily sensations and for pain in\nparticular.\n\nNevertheless, it is plausible to argue that this apparent strength of\nsense-datum theories of pain is also one of their main weaknesses, in\nthat their function seems to merely codify the conceptual\npeculiarities of pain into a theory rather than explain them. After we\nare told how the sense-datum theories treat pains and other bodily\nsensations, our understanding of these sensations don\u2019t seem to\nbe deepened or advanced significantly. Whatever puzzles we had at the\nstart with only the common-sense conception of pain at hand, they seem\nto be transformed into puzzles about what the theories themselves say\nor imply.\n\nFor instance, the question about what it is that we seem to attribute\nto or locate in our body parts when we claim to have pains in just\nthose parts is answered, on one version of the theory, by saying that\nwe literally locate mental objects with phenomenal qualities in those\nparts. But pains, even by the standards of sense-datum theories, are\nmind-dependent objects, and many have taken this to imply that pains\nare internal to one\u2019s consciousness or experience, and\nare epistemically transparent to their owners partly because of this\n(Perkins 1983,\n 2006).[8]\n If they were literally in physical space, does this mean that\none\u2019s mind spatially extends or overlaps with one\u2019s body?\nAlternatively, shouldn\u2019t it be possible for others, at least in\nprinciple, to \u201ccome across\u201d these pains, that is, access\nand interact with them physically? It is one thing to say that there\nis no logical inconsistency about pains literally being in physical\nspace, but it is another to make the view plausible. The latter\nrequires giving positive arguments showing why our intuitions to the\ncontrary might mislead us here.\n\nOn the other version of the theory, we are told that even though we\nseem to locate something in public space, appearances are misleading;\nrather, we are locating private mental objects in a private phenomenal\nspace, which is conceived to be a kind of space, not merely a\nrepresentation of real space.\u00a0 So, on this version, pains are\nnot, after all, located in body parts, ordinarily understood. But it\nis not clear how these two spaces are supposed to relate to or\ninteract with each other. Phenomenal space is not physical space, nor\nis it a subregion of that space. Thus the question of how they can\ncausally interact becomes an issue for two reasons. First,\nthere is the standard worry about how a physical event can influence\nor be influenced by a non-physical event in a non-physical space.\nSecond, these two spaces need to be systematically correlated with\neach other, but it is not clear whether a principled mapping function\ncan be defined for the correlation especially in the absence of\ncausation. At any rate, these constitute significant challenges for\nthe defenders of this view.\n\nApart from their strange consequences, sense-datum theories seem to\ncommit their defenders to anti-physicalism. A naturalist who is trying\nto understand pain phenomena within a physicalist framework could\nhardly admit the existence of phenomenal objects (Lycan 1987a, 1987b).\nIf there are sense-data, physicalism seems just false. A physicalist\ncannot admit actual objects, which are, say, literally colored,\nshaped, moving and so on, that one is directly aware of but are not\nidentical to the extramental objects of perception. So understood,\nthere seem to be no sense-data to be found in the physical world.\n",
