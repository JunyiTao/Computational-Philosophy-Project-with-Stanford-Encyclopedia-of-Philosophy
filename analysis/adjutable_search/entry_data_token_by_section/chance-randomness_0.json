    "main_text": "Chance\n1. Chance\n\n\nTo get clear on the connections and differences between chance and\nrandomness, it would be good first to have some idea of what chance and\nrandomness amount to. Interestingly, philosophical attention has\nfocussed far more on chance than randomness. This may well be a\nconsequence of the Commonplace Thesis. Whatever its source, we can\nappeal to a substantial consensus in the philosophical literature as to\nwhat kind of thing chance must be.\n\n\nCarnap (1945) distinguished between two conceptions of probability,\narguing that both were scientifically important. His\n\u2018probability\\(_1\\)\u2019 corresponds to an epistemic\nnotion, nowadays glossed either (following Carnap himself) as\nevidential probability, or as credence or degree of\nbelief. This is contrasted with Carnap\u2019s\n\u2018probability\\(_2\\)\u2019, which is the concept of a\nnon-epistemic objective kind of probability, better known as\nchance.\n\n\nThere are many philosophical accounts of what actually grounds\nchance, as part of the minor philosophical industry of producing\n\u2018interpretations\u2019\u2014really, reductive analyses or\nexplications\u2014of probability. In this vein we have at least the\nfrequency theory of Reichenbach (1949) and von Mises (1957)\n(and Carnap\u2019s own explication of probability\\(_2\\) was in terms\nof frequencies), the propensity theory of Popper (1959) and\nGiere (1973), as well as many more recent accounts, notably Lewis\u2019\n(1994) \u2018Best System\u2019 account of chance (see also Loewer\n2004). There is no agreement over which, if any, of these accounts are\nright; certainly both the accounts mentioned face difficulties in\ngiving an adequate account of chance. The consensus mentioned earlier\nis not over what actually plays the role of chance, but rather on the\nconstraints that determine what that role is.\n\n\nThere can be such a consensus because \u2018chance\u2019 is not a\ntechnical term, but is rather an ordinary concept deployed in fairly\nfamiliar situations (games of chance, complicated and unpredictable\nscenarios, large ensembles of similar events, etc.). There is\nwidespread agreement amongst native speakers of English over when\n\u2018chance\u2019 applies to a particular case, and this agreement\nat least indicates that there is a considerable body of ordinary belief\nabout chance. One needn\u2019t take the deliverances of folk intuition as\nsacrosanct to recognise that this ordinary belief provides the starting\npoint for philosophical accounts of chance. It may turn out that\nnothing fits the role picked out by these ordinary beliefs and\ntheir philosophical precisifications, yet even in that case we\u2019d be\ninclined to conclude that chance doesn\u2019t exist, not that our ordinary\nbeliefs about what chance must be are incorrect.\n\n\nBelow, some of the theoretical principles that philosophers have\nextracted from commonplace beliefs about chance will be outlined. (In\nso doing, we freely use probabilistic notation and concepts; see the\n entry on interpretations of probability,\n H\u00e1jek 2012:\n \u00a71,\n for background\nprobability theory required to understand these expressions.) Two such\nconstraints have been widely accepted since the early days of the\nphilosophy of probability. Firstly, it is required that the mathematics\nof chance should conform to some standard mathematical theory of\nprobability such as Kolmogorov\u2019s 1933 axiomatisation of the probability\ncalculus (or some recognisable variant thereof, like Popper\u2019s\naxiomatisation of conditional probability). Secondly, chance should be\nobjective: mind-independent and not epistemic or evidential. But a\nnumber of other constraints have been articulated and defended in the\nliterature. (Schaffer 2007: \u00a74 contains a useful discussion of\nthese and other constraints on the chance role.) While these principles\nhave been termed \u2018things we know about chance\u2019, this\nshouldn\u2019t be taken to preclude our discovering that there is no such\nthing as chance\u2014rather, the philosophical consensus is that if\nthere is any such thing as chance, it will (more or less) fit these\nconstraints.\n\n\n\n\nChance should regulate (that is, it is involved with norms\ngoverning) rational belief in line with Lewis\u2019 Principal Principle\n(Lewis, 1980), or his New Principle (Lewis, 1994; Hall, 2004). Where\n\\(C\\) is a reasonable initial credence function, and \\(E\\) is\nthe evidence, the Principal Principle (omitting some complications) is this:\n\n\n(PP)\n\\(C(p \\mid \\ulcorner\\Ch(p) = x\\urcorner \\wedge E) = x\\);\nThis principle says that rational initial credence should treat\nchance as an expert, deferring to it with respect to opinions about\nthe outcome \\(p\\), by adopting the corresponding chances as your\nown conditional degree of belief. The New Principle\u2014adopted to\ndeal with some problematic interactions between Lewis\u2019 metaphysics and\nthe PP\u2014advocates deferring to chance in a somewhat different\nway. This New Principle NP suggests (more or less) that rational initial credence\nshould treat chance as an expert with respect to the\noutcome \\(p\\), by adopting the conditional chances, on the\nadmissible evidence, as your conditional degrees of belief on that\nsame evidence, as in this principle (this claim corresponds to\nequation 3.9 in Hall 2004; see his discussion at pp. 102\u20135 for\nsome important qualifications, and the connection to the formulation\nof the NP in Lewis 1994):\n\n(Chance-Analyst)\n\\(C(p \\mid \\ulcorner\\Ch(p \\mid E) = x\\urcorner \\wedge E) = x\\).\n Non-reductionist views about chance, which take chances to be\nindependent fundamental features of reality, can follow PP.\nReductionists, who take the values of chances to be fixed entirely by\nother features of reality (normally frequencies and symmetries, but\nchance is typically constrained by them in a quite indirect manner),\n are for technical reasons (to do with undermining, see supplement\n A.1)\n ordinarily forced to adopt NP, and Chance-Analyst, as\nnorms on credence, though in many ordinary cases, NP and PP give\nvery similar recommendations. In either case, both formal principles\ngive content to the intuitively plausible idea that chances should\n guide reasonable\n credence.[1]\n\n\n\n\nChance should connect with possibility. Leibniz claimed that\nprobability was a kind of \u2018graded possibility\u2019, and more\nrecent authors have largely agreed. In particular, it seems clear that\nif an outcome has some chance of occurring, then it is possible that\nthe outcome occurs. This intuition has been made precise in the Basic\n Chance Principle (BCP) (See supplement\n A.2\n for further details on this\nprinciple):\n\n\nSuppose \\(x \\gt 0\\) and\n\\(Ch_{tw}(A) = x\\). Then\n\\(A\\) is true in at least one of those worlds \\(w'\\)\nthat matches \\(w\\) up to time \\(t\\) and for which\n\\(Ch_t (A) = x\\). (Bigelow\net al., 1993: 459)\n\n\nBut one needn\u2019t accept precisely this version of the BCP to endorse\nthe general thesis that chance and possibility must be linked\u2014for\nother versions of this kind of claim, see Mellor (2000); Eagle\n(2011) and the \u2018realization principle\u2019 of Schaffer\n(2007: 124).\n\n\n\n\nChance should connect with actual frequencies, at least to the\nextent of permitting frequencies to be good evidence for the values of\nchances. This may be through some direct connection between chance and\nfrequency, or indirectly through the influence of observed outcome\nfrequencies on credences about chances via the Principal Principle\n(Lewis, 1980: 104\u20136). But chance should not be identified with\nfrequency\u2014since a fair coin can produce any sequence of outcomes,\nthere is no possibility of identifying chance with observed frequency.\n(Though of course a fair coin is overwhelmingly likely to produce\nroughly even numbers of heads and tails when tossed often enough).\nMoreover, there can be a chance for a kind of outcome even when there\nare very few instances of the relevant process that leads to that\noutcome, resulting in the actual frequencies being misleading or\ntrivial (for example, if there is only a single actual outcome:\nH\u00e1jek 1997).\n\n\n\n\nWhen considering the connection between frequency and chance, not\njust any frequency will do. What is wanted is the frequency in\nrelevantly similar trials, with the same kind of experimental setup.\nThe relevance of frequencies in such trial is derived from the\nassumption that in such similar trials, the same chances exist:\nintra-world duplicate trials should have the same chances. This is\nclosely related to the \u2018stable trial principle\u2019 (Schaffer,\n2003: 37ff). Chances attach to the outcomes of trials, but the physical\ngrounds of the chance lie in the physical properties of the trial\ndevice or chance setup.\n\n\n\n\nMore details on all of these principles can be found in this\nsupplementary document:\n\nSupplement A.
