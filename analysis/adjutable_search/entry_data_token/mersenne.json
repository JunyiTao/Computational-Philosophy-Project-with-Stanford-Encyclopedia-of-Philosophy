His tireless activity certainly helped to create a new\nimage of a mathematical, mechanistic and experimental science in the\nmaking, based on the exchange of information and co-operation between\nEuropean scholars. Part of his fame is also due to his lifelong\nconnection to Descartes.

Life and Works\n\nMarin Mersenne was born on 8 September 1588 near Oiz\u00e9 in the\nFrench region of Haut-Maine (nowadays the Sarthe). He came from a\nfamily of merchants and small landowners. After studying at the\ncollege du Mans, he was sent in 1604 to the newly created Jesuit\ncollege of La Fl\u00e8che, where he received the established Jesuit\neducation, coupling humanist\u2014Ciceronian\u2014and Aristotelian\ntraditions (Dear 1988). He may have met there the young Ren\u00e9\nDescartes, who entered La Fl\u00e8che in 1606, although it is\nunlikely that their friendship started then, as Descartes was 8 years\nhis junior. When he left the college, Mersenne completed his training\nin theology, Greek and Hebrew in Paris at the Coll\u00e8ge Royal and\nat the Sorbonne where he was instructed by the Thomist theologians\nFran\u00e7ois Ysambert and Philippe de Gamache (see Coste 1648;\nArmogathe 1994). Attracted to the strict rule of the Minims, a\nFranciscan order recently introduced into France, he took the habits\nin 1611, and after periods of novitiate and teaching in Meaux, Paris\nand Never, was recalled to Paris in 1619 at the new house on the Place\nRoyale (the present Place des Vosges) where he remained permanently,\napart from a few trips to the French provinces, to the Netherlands in\n1630, and to Italy from 1644 to 1645.\n\nFrom the years 1620 onward, Mersenne deployed overflowing intellectual\nactivity. Through the mediation of Claude Fabbri de Pereisc whom he\nhad met in 1616, he was introduced to the Parisian intellectual elite,\nand later to Pierre Gassendi with whom he remained close friends. In\nParis, he associated with the mathematician Claude Mydorge, and,\nperhaps through him, renewed acquaintance with Descartes. Mersenne\ncalled on Descartes\u2019s mathematical expertise on questions of\noptics. His questions led Descartes to his first formulation of the\nlaw of refraction, which he was to publish later in his 1637\n\u201cDioptrics\u201d. Mersenne was among those attending the famous\nmeeting of 1628, at the residence of the apostolic nuncio, where\nDescartes, having revealed his project of founding the sciences on a\nnew method, had been encouraged to do so by the highest religious\nauthorities. After Descartes left for Holland, Mersenne remained in\nclose contact with him through correspondence. He was privy to most of\nDescartes\u2019s secret addresses, which made him the man one has to\nsee in order to get access to the French exile, to send him letters or\nquestions. Only four letters from Mersenne to Descartes are extant,\nbut 146 letters from Descartes\u2014about a quarter of his known\ncorrespondence\u2014testify to the intensity and continuity of the\nexchange. Mersenne endlessly provided Descartes with books, fresh\ninformation, and editorial services, requesting in exchange answers to\nqueries of all sorts. Acting as mediator in Descartes\u2019s\ncontroversies, with Fermat, Roberval, Beaugrand, Morin, or\nVo\u00ebtius, he sometimes caused quarrels himself, through his\nindiscretions, such as the one which made Descartes definitively fall\nout with his erstwhile mentor Isaac Beeckman. Mersenne also acted as\nintermediary for the edition of the Meditationes de prima\nphilosophiae, and was instrumental in the gathering of the six\nsets of objections that were added to the text with Descartes\u2019s\nresponses, including those of Hobbes and Gassendi. He contributed\nhimself to the objectiones, penning the second set (\u201cgathered by\nthe R. P. Mersenne from the mouth of various theologians and\nphilosophers\u201d, AT IX-1: 96; Buccolini 2019) and perhaps parts of\nthe sixth.\n\nMersenne\u2019s dealings with Descartes were only a small part of the\nnetwork of intellectual communication that he built up throughout his\ncareer. He was largely responsible for introducing Galileo into\nFrance, offering in 1630\u2014without receiving an answer\u2014to\npublish his future work on the Two Chief Systems of the\nWorld. In 1634, he published Les M\u00e9chaniques de\nGalil\u00e9e, a free translation of a manuscript on mechanics\nby the Florentine scholar, completed with ideas borrowed from\nGuidobaldo and Stevin, and with original comments of his own, and, in\n1639, the Nouvelles pens\u00e9es de Galil\u00e9e, a\ntranslation or adaptation of certain parts of the Discorsi a due\nnuove scienze, published in Italy one year earlier. Mersenne was\nalso in regular contact with English scholars. He translated into\nFrench the De Veritate of Herbert of Cherbury (although the\nbook had been placed in the Index, i.e., the list of prohibited books\npublished by the Catholic Church); in good terms with Hobbes (Baldin\n2020), he published one of his optical treatises, and\nSorbi\u00e8re\u2019s French translation of the De Cive. He\ncorresponded with Kenelm Digby and Lord Cavendish and others.\n\nIn Paris, a small scientific circle of mathematicians and physicists\ngradually formed around Mersenne. From 1633 or so, meetings were\norganized on Thursdays at the houses of one or another of his friends\nor protectors. This \u201cAcademia Parisiensis\u201d, as it came to\nbe called, brought together men such as \u00c9tienne Pascal,\nMydorge, Hardy, Roberval, Fermat. It was later to welcome the young\nBlaise Pascal, and Jacques Le Pailleur who was to become the\ngroup\u2019s leader when Mersenne died in 1648. Discussions were\nmostly \u201cmathematical\u201d (MC V: 209). Mersenne used to submit\nproblems of his own invention to his friends, and some were often\nremarkably stimulating and the origin of important discoveries such as\nthe \u201croulette\u201d problem, solved by Roberval in 1634; and\nthen more indirectly by Fermat and Descartes. Mersenne himself\nundertook to establish a first list of what will eventually be called\nthe \u201cMersenne primes\u201d, prime numbers that can be written\nin the form 2n \u2212 1 (for some integer n),\nwhose properties and determination are still topical questions in\ncontemporary mathematics. Mersenne envisaged his meeting group, and\nhis own net of correspondents, as the prototype for a larger\ninstitution that would bring scholars together in a pacified Europe,\nforeshadowing the foundation of the later Acad\u00e9mie des sciences\nin 1666, or the Royal Society in England (MC V: 301\u2013302, and\nGoldstein 2013)\n\nIn 1623 and 1625, Mersenne published three massive philosophical\nworks. The Questiones celeberrimae in Genesim (which covers\nalmost 1900 folio columns), a commentary on the six first chapters of\nthe book of Genesis, larded with long scientific and philosophical\ndigressions, was intended as an apology of Christian religion against\nall forms of \u201catheism\u201d. It contains attacks on various\nPlatonist, cabbalistic and hermetic authors such as Bernardino\nTelesio, Pietro Pomponazzi, Giordano Bruno, Jacques Gaffarel, or the\nEnglish hermetic author, Robert Fludd. The tone is virulent, sometimes\noffensive, and the book attracted several outraged answers. Fludd in\nparticular reacted in his Sophia cum moria certamen (1629)\nwhich itself drew a long reply from Gassendi, writing upon\nMersenne\u2019s request (Gassendi 1630). The same inspiration governs\nL\u2019Impi\u00e9t\u00e9 des D\u00e9istes, published\nin French the next year. It is a point-by-point refutation of the 106\nQuatrains du D\u00e9iste or Anti-Bigot, a long\nanonymous poem denouncing Christian revelation, bigoted superstition\nand belief in a personal God. Mersenne\u2019s response, written as a\ndialogue between a deist and a theologian, leads to the conversion of\nthe deist, to whom the existence, justice and mercy of the Christian\nGod are demonstrated. Dedicated to Richelieu, and perhaps written on\ncommand, the book may be seen as taking part in a larger campaign\norchestrated by the French state and the catholic church, at a time\nthat witnessed Vanini\u2019s execution in Toulouse, the trial of\nTheophile de Viau, and a strengthening of repressive measures against\nanti-Aristotelian philosophical novelties. La V\u00e9rit\u00e9\ndes sciences (1625) is a dialogue between an alchemist, a skeptic\nand a Christian philosopher, the latter opposing both the\nover-confidence of the first and the excessive doubts of the second.\nThe second, third and fourth parts of the book, dealing with\narithmetic and geometry, is an 800-page compilation of ancient and\nrecent achievements in the mathematical sciences, intended to show\nthat there are regions of human knowledge immune from doubt, and which\ndo not contradict Christian wisdom.\n\nBy the end of the 1620s, Mersenne\u2019s former animosity towards the\nanti-aristotelians authors withered, giving way to a more lenient if\nnot tolerant approach. Galileo whom he had listed among the dangerous\nones in 1623 is now the object of great praise. Mersenne seemed much\nless concerned with the proliferation of atheists and heretics, and he\nexpressed regrets about the offensive tone of his previous works\n(Letter to Rivet 12 nov. 1639, MC X: 599). His travel to Holland in\n1630 put him in contact with Protestant scholars, such as Andr\u00e9\nRivet and the Socinian Ruarus, who became regular correspondents.\nMersenne who used to vilify the heretics, was now taken to task for\nhis sympathies with the enemy, and he was sometimes dubbed the\n\u201cHuguenot monk\u201d. In any case the staunch defense of\northodoxy of the first works is nowhere to be found in\nMersenne\u2019s next publications, which, from 1634 onward, are\nalmost entirely devoted to the promotion of the mathematical sciences,\nbroadly conceived. It has been a question among biographers and\ncommentators whether these changes reflect a conversion to a new\nagenda or a new philosophical outlook. Robert Lenoble (1943: 38)\nconsiders that until 1634, Mersenne was still looking for a better\nphilosophy of nature and held provisionally to Aristotelianism,\n\u201cwhereas at that date he discovered what he had sought for many\nyears, namely Mechanism\u201d. Sylvie Taussig (2009b) considers that\nMersenne went through a serious crisis, both moral and intellectual,\nat the end of the 1620s, and that under the influence of Peiresc and\nGassendi he came to adopt a more skeptical outlook on philosophical\nand religious matters. Without denying Mersenne\u2019s change of tone\nand accent, Garber (2004) and Dear (1988) tend to underplay the extent\nand meaning of Mersenne\u2019s \u201cconversion\u201d to the new\nphilosophy, considering that his agenda of promoting mixed mathematics\nwas to him still compatible with a traditional philosophical\noutlook\u2014\u201cthe learning of the schools\u201d, that Dear\ndescribed as conjoining Christianized Aristotelianism, Renaissance\nhumanism and a skeptical or probabilistic approach to philosophical\nmatters. We shall come back to these issues in due course.\n\nThe five treatises published in a row in 1634 are representative of\nthe kind of intellectual productions Mersenne would henceforth offer.\nTwo of them (Questions inouyes, and Questions\nth\u00e9ologiques\u2026) are eclectic lists of\n\u201ccurious\u201d questions, intended for entertainment\n(r\u00e9cr\u00e9ation) as well as for instruction of the\nlearned: can one walk on water without miracle? How many grain of\nsands can be contained in the sphere of the earth ? From where does\nthe satisfaction come when one believes one has found a new\ndemonstration or truth? In these questions metaphysical, apologetic\nand even theological considerations are (in spite of the title of the\nsecond treatise) barely present. The Questions harmoniques\nand the Pr\u00e9ludes to the harmonie universelle prepare\nthe way for the publication of Mersenne\u2019s great achievement on\nmusical theory, The Harmonie Universelle (1636\u20137),\nwhere he offers what is still considered a major contribution to the\nscientific understanding of \u201cconsonance\u201d and acoustics.\nFinally the Mechaniques de Galil\u00e9e illustrate\nMersenne\u2019s constant interest in physico-mathematical questions\nof Galilean type, that is Archimedean mechanics stricto sensu, dealing\nwith basic machines, such as the lever, the wheel, the pulley, but\nalso the sciences of motion, free fall, ballistics, pneumatics,\nhydrostatics, and optics. Mersenne pursued these interests in the\n1640s, when he started to make his own campaigns of experiments in\norder to verify Galilean numerical data on free fall and on the\nvelocity of a cannon ball, especially during his journey to Italy\n(1644\u20131645) where he met Torricelli. These researches resulted\nin the publication of his Cogitate physico-mathematica (1644)\nand his Novarum observum physico-matheaticarum (1647), which\nincludes in its first part a treatise by Roberval on the system of the\nworld. A book on optics was to be published after Mersenne\u2019s\ndeath (L\u2019Optique et la catoptrique, 1651).\n2. Scientific Apologetics\n\nMersenne was indubitably an heir to the Thomistic view of a necessary\nsynthesis between Christian faith and philosophy. As expressed in the\npraefatium of the Quaestiones in Genesim, it is \u201ca duty\nof the learned to refute atheists\u201d, the tacit assumption being\nthat \u201ctrue philosophy never contradicts the teachings of the\nChurch\u201d (ID II: 490\u20131). This synthesis was vindicated in\nthe rather troubled political, and religious context of early\nseventeenth-century France, which still bore the scars of half a\ncentury of religious wars, and appeared exposed and vulnerable to what\nCatholics considered a severe crisis of orthodoxy, raging on all\nfronts. A rising tide of libertines, deists, skeptics, cabbalists,\nalchemists, and naturalist metaphysicians, all more or less\nconsciously in league with the Protestants, seemed to Mersenne on the\nverge of overwhelming the \u201ctrue\u201d Christian faith. Mersenne\noften pointed out the connection between Protestantism and the various\nforms of heterodoxy and atheism: the Calvinist belief in\npredestination insensibly drives men toward superstition and atheism,\nas it appears more difficult to believe that God wants our damnation,\nthan to represent Him as a \u201ccruel Saturn who devours his\nchildren\u201d, or simply to own that there is no God at all (ID II:\n589). So, Mersenne\u2019s early-interventions may be seen as taking\npart in the larger movement of \u201cre-catholization\u201d of the\nFrench state after the pacification allowed by the Edit de Nantes. In\nthis regard, Mersenne\u2019s advocacy of a harmonious conciliation of\nfaith and reason was not without similarities with a noted feature of\nGalileo\u2019s \u201ccultural program\u201d in the same years: both\nwanted to contribute to the Counter-Reformation, and both defended the\nspecific idea that Catholics should not leave to Protestant heretics\nthe monopoly of reason and scientific knowledge. Mersenne was however\nwary of any anti-Aristotelian philosophical novelties (including those\nof Galileo himself), as he saw them as ipso facto dangerously\nverging towards contesting religious truth. According to Garber\n(2004), the Aristotelian framework, particularly prominent in the\nfirst works, was adopted not so much for its philosophical virtues as\nsuch, but rather as a rampart of orthodoxy, as a tried doctrine, that\nhas long proved its ability to be harmoniously conjoined with\nChristian faith, and as it were to protect it. By contrast,\nalternative ways of thinking offered no such guarantee against heresy,\nas they were often defended with a zeal that was dangerously close to\nfanaticism. As Mersenne stated in the preface to the\nQuaestiones (1623):\n\n\nThese men who desire to found a new philosophy, and to demonstrate it\nfrom fundamental principles, never regard the glory of God. Rather\nthey strive with an ignorant obsessive zeal [cacozelia], by\nwhich they seek to shake up and overturn the Catholic religion, if\nthey are able to do it\u2014unless I am mistaken. (QG Praefatio,\ntranslated in Garber 2004: 141)\n\n\nThus it seems quite clear that the stakes of a book like the\nQuaestiones were not simply a defense of natural religion but\nalso, and perhaps primarily, a defense of catholic faith (and its\nmysteries) against the caricature conveyed in a growing number of\nwritings, that represented it as resulting from superstition and\nignorance:\n\n\nIt is appropriate to Catholics, and especially to theologians to know\nthe sciences and to scrutinize God\u2019s works, not only because we\nthus receive the meaning of His will as from the pages of a Book, but\nalso because we show how unfounded is the atheist\u2019s\nrepresentation of Catholics as melancholic, agitated with thousands\nscruples and superstitions. (QG: col 2 \u2013 translation here and\nelsewhere from the author, unless otherwise indicated)\n\n\nTo realize this aim, Mersenne\u2019s strategy was twofold: polemical\nand constructive. On the one hand he attacked his polymorph enemy with\nthe rhetorical instruments of a skilled debater, using the weapons of\nthe adversaries, or making one refute the other (as in the dialogue\nbetween the alchemist and the skeptic in the first book of La\nV\u00e9rit\u00e9 des sciences). Hermetic authors such as\nRobert Fludd, or cabbalistic Christians such as Giovanni Pico and\nJacques Gaffarel were vehemently denounced, as they availed themselves\nof spurious allegorical interpretations of the Bible. Even when their\nreading of the Bible is not wrong, they are dangerous as they make\npeople believe they can deduce a priori, or through divine\ninspiration, what can only be known a posteriori, through\nrevelation and experience. Heretic tendencies were pointed out in the\ndoctrines of the Alchemists, who, in the wake of Paracelsus\u2019s\nMysterium magnum, tried to give naturalist interpretations of\nChristian mysteries, such as the resurrection or the miracle of\nCreation. Mages, sorcerers, and adepts of esoteric mysteries such as\nthe Rosicrucians prosper on men\u2019s propensity to superstition.\nNaturalist metaphysicians\u2014Bruno, Campanella,\nPomponnazi\u2014who endowed nature with creative powers, verge\ndangerously toward pantheism, casting doubt on creation, on the\ntranscendence and freedom of God. A leading thread in all these\ncriticisms, is the idea that the Catholic belief in miracles and\nmysteries, far from being superstitious, is much more attuned to sound\nreason than the doctrines that are opposed to it. A light knowledge of\nphilosophy may induce some doubts, but the more one knows the\nsciences, the more these Catholic beliefs and mysteries are reinforced\nand may be vindicated against false religion and atheism. A smattering\nof knowledge in optics can for example cast doubt on the truth of\ndivine epiphanies, but a better knowledge of this same science allows\none to exclude the idea that miracles can be illusions caused by\nreflections or refractions and therefore makes more sensible their\ndivine origin (QG: col. 522, 538). This sort of negative argument\nshows that Mersenne\u2019s rationalist defense of religion allows for\ntruths beyond the capacity of men\u2019s reason. In this, Mersenne\nstand explicitly against the deist. Both allowed for \u201cnatural\nreligion\u201d, but whereas the deist denounced the superstition and\nanthropomorphism of popular belief, Mersenne reversed the attacks and\ndenounced the far worse anthropomorphism of one who measures God by\nhuman reason: \u201cit is feebleness of the mind, to believe that our\nfinite understandings can comprehend the divine attributes or\nacts\u201d (ID I: 318\u20139; see also ID I: 669\u201370, and\nBeaude 1980). This however should not be understood as revealing a\nsecret inclination towards fideism: religion teaches truths which\nsurpass reason, \u201cnot in destroying it, but rather in perfecting\nit\u201d (ID I: 680).\n\nMersenne\u2019s criticisms are based on a careful reading and\nexposition of the adverse doctrines, to the point that Mersenne has\nbeen sometimes taken to task for offering the enemies of religion a\nmuch too complacent advertisement. It has been remarked (Carraud 1994:\n152) that the discourse of others (le discours\nd\u2019autrui) holds a distinctive place in Mersenne\u2019s\nwritings: it is neither dismissed as in Descartes, nor deftly\nre-appropriated as in Leibniz, but rather faithfully produced and\nreported in order to be discussed on its own level and according to\nits own merits. This is the case, for example with the cabbalistic\n\u201csefirot\u201d and numerological methods which are\npatiently, almost sympathetically, expounded in the\nImpi\u00e9t\u00e9. The same holds for Giordano\nBruno\u2019s doctrine. However heretical the man was, his arguments in\nfavor of the infinity and plurality of the worlds (from his De\nInfinito) are not simply dismissed or brushed aside. The\nChristian philosopher reports them quite accurately in the second part\nof the Impi\u00e9t\u00e9 des d\u00e9istes, before\nanswering and criticizing them.\n\nApart from its polemical intent, Mersenne\u2019s \u201cscientific\napologetics\u201d may be seen as articulating a natural theology\ntogether with a \u201csacred physics\u201d or \u201csacred\nmathematics\u201d. On the one hand a host of rational\narguments\u2014some of them borrowed from the sciences, some from\ntraditional metaphysics\u2014are brought in to prove God\u2019s\nexistence and demonstrate His attributes. This natural theology is\nwhere Mersenne articulates his main ideas on metaphysics and we shall\ncome back to it in the next part of this article. On the other hand,\nscience is used as an instrument of exegesis. The Quaestiones in\nGenesim contains thus numerous scientific excursuses whose aim is\neither to give a scientific (mainly mathematical) exposition of a\nbiblical content\u2014as when Mersenne \u201ccalculates\u201d what\nshould be the size of Noah\u2019s ark, or suggests that our knowledge\nof architecture should help us to see the excellence of the temple of\nSolomon\u2014or to illustrate a Catholic mystery (such as the triadic\nunity of God or the miracle of the Creation) through a mathematical\nanalogy.\n\nThis edifying use of mathematics is perhaps the hallmark of\nMersenne\u2019s writings. It is still very much present in later\npublications (such as the Harmonie Universelle). The minim is\nliterally fascinated by the almost magical properties of numbers and\ngeometrical figures, where the most surprising and complicated objects\nand properties are generated from the simplest principles. This gives\nhim a general analogy for religious truths. There are \u201cthousands\nof things in the mysteries of faith\u201d that are\n\u201cincomprehensible to the pagan and to a peripatetic\nphilosopher\u201d, but that may be made understood by a\n\u201cChristian Euclid\u201d (un Euclide chr\u00e9tien) :\nMathematics makes the relation of the infinite to the finite sensible,\nshowing how an infinite motion can be made in a finite space. It can\nthus \u201cexplain\u201d the union of the two natures in the same\ndivine person. Although the mathematical point is the humblest object,\n\u201cthe minim of geometry\u201d (HU III: Livre de\nl\u2019Utilit\u00e9 de l\u2019Harmonie, 16), it is in a sense the\nclosest to God itself. Both are simple, without parts. The point\nengenders the line and together with the line, the surfaces, and with\nlines and surfaces the bodies. This gives us an insight on how God\nengenders the son, the son and God together, the holy spirit, and then\nall together the universe. Unity contains all numbers eminently, as\nGod contains all created acts and all creatures, etc (ibid. 16\u201317).\nMersenne also likes to suggest mathematical analogies illustrating, or\nsymbolizing moral virtues. Thus, as the height of a triangle is\nmeasured by a perpendicular line elevated from the basis, the goodness\nof our actions is measured by the righteousness of our intention\n(\u201cla droite intention\u201d, VS I: 12). Mixed mathematics,\noptics, music and mechanics are also mobilized in the moral use of\nmathematics. For example:\n\n\nmechanics teaches us to live well, either by imitating heavy bodies\nwhich always seek their center in the center of the Earth, just as the\nspirit of Man must seek his own center in the divine essence which is\nthe source of all our spirits, or by maintaining ourselves in that\nperpetual moral and moderate balance which consists of rendering all\nthat belongs to Him first of all to God and then to our neighbor. (MC\nIV: 208\u201309)\n\n\nThe philosophical value of Mersenne\u2019s apologetics may be\ndifferently assessed. Mersenne seemed to pay little attention to\ncontemporary arguments according to which the Bible is not to be taken\nliterally on questions dealing with nature (see, e.g., Galileo\u2019s\n1615 Letter to Christina). His exegesis indeed offers a rather rough\nexample of what will be later called \u201cconcordism\u201d, the\nconception that there cannot be any discrepancy between the teachings\nof the sciences and those of the Bible, taken in the most literal\nsense. However, the most distinctive aspect of Mersenne\u2019s\napologetics, the edifying use of mathematics, although sometimes\nna\u00efve in its formulations, did have philosophical influence.\nPascal, who does not spare his sarcasm on those who think they can\n\u201cprove God from the course of the moon and the planets\u201d\n(Pascal 1963: 599, fg. 781), is nevertheless quite faithful to\nMersenne\u2019s use of mathematics, when he discusses men\u2019s\ndisproportion and God\u2019s greatness from the mathematical model of\nthe infinite divisibility of space, or from a speculation on the two\ninfinites whose terms are reminiscent of similar passages from the\nImpi\u00e9t\u00e9.\n\nBesides, although Mersenne\u2019s \u201cscientific\napologetics\u201d was primarily conceived as a defense of religion\nagainst \u201catheists\u201d, where science is only a tool, it\nturned out to be also a defense of mathematical sciences against\nwhoever might think that they are vain curiosity and must be either\nrejected, or at least relativized as inessential knowledge\u2026\nThis is especially manifest in the later works, where Mersenne gave\nfree rein to his passion for mathematical sciences. Whereas natural\ntheology and anti-deistic polemic were no longer dominant themes, he\nstill vindicated the \u201cusefulness\u201d of mathematics, not only\nfor men\u2019s welfare, but for their edifying virtues. In the next\ndecades, one could find similar moves in defense of the\n\u201cusefulness of natural experimental philosophy\u201d in the\nworks of Robert Boyle.\n3. Metaphysical Issues\n3.1 Metaphysics as Rational Theology\n\nIn the Quaestiones, Mersenne offered a tripartition of the\ntheoretical sciences: metaphysics considers \u201ctrans-natural\nobjects, such as God and the angels, that are actually separated from\nall matter\u201d; doctrinal sciences\u2014that is\nmathematics\u2014deals with objects that are \u201cin truth\nmaterial, but considered abstracted from matter, such as the line and\nthe figure\u201d; natural sciences (physics) considers\n\u201cmaterial things as such, for example the heavens or the\nelements\u201d. (QG: col 92\u20133). In La\nV\u00e9rit\u00e9 (VS I: 50), Mersenne suggested that\nmetaphysics, although an abstract science, like logic and mathematics,\nis nevertheless closer to physics, in so far as their shared aim is to\nconsider \u201cthings as they are in themselves\u201d, and not\nsimply things as they appear to our senses\u2014in this both sciences\n\u201care rightly called sapience\u201d. He was later to revise this\ncoupling, suggesting in his Questions inou\u00efes (QI: 54)\nthat metaphysics is closer to mathematics, on account of the fact\nthat, contrary to physics, metaphysics and mathematics both consider\nimmutable and eternal objects, and are the only ones among the\nsciences capable of being really possessed by men here below.\n\nThe definition of metaphysics given in the Quaestiones is\nstrongly reminiscent of Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics E1\u2014where\n\u201cprime philosophy\u201d is conceived as strictly concerned with\nthe separated or immaterial substances, thus with the\n\u201ctheological\u201d realm. Jean-Luc Marion (1994) pointed out\nthat although Mersenne, in several places, acknowledges formally\nanother traditional object for metaphysics, that is the \u201cens\nquatenus ens\u201d (the abstracted Being as such, whose science\napplies indifferently to all beings, created or uncreated), he seemed\nreluctant to give this science (that we now call ontology) any\nsubstance. In a striking passage from the Quaestiones,\nMersenne said that \u201cBeing\u201d is a name that suits God better\nthan any of the creatures:\n\n\nAmong all names \u201cbeing\u201d is the one that we should ascribe\nto God, rather than all the other ones naming the perfections of\ncreatures\u2026 God could justly say \u201cI am all Being, as I\ncontains all things more perfectly than they can contain\nthemselves\u201d. This is why all creatures could say \u201cmy name\nis non-Being, or non-entity\u201d (Non Esse, seu non Ens),\nas, according to Plato, truly all things except God have non-being\nrather than being. (QG: col. 21)\n\n\nIn later works the specificity of ontology was quickly dissolved into\nlogic on the one hand (an abstract science which shares with ontology\nthe same principle of non-contradiction, see VS 52\u201355) and into\nrational theology on the other hand, the science of immaterial beings\nand first causes. This dissolution may be seen as anticipating\nDescartes\u2019s own reduction of metaphysics to \u201cprime\nphilosophy\u201d, and, according to Marion, this is a very\nsignificant (albeit a merely negative one) legacy of Mersenne\u2019s\nwork to the history of metaphysics.\n3.2 Proofs of God\u2019s Existence\n\nThe bulk of Mersenne\u2019s contribution to rational theology is\ncontained in the 700 or so first columns of his Quaestiones in\nGenesim, where no less than 35 proofs of God\u2019s existence\nare reckoned and detailed. The importance of rational demonstration is\ndirectly related to the apologetic project: one cannot simply be\ncontent with the idea that God is immediately known, as this could not\nshut the mouths of the atheists. The encyclopedic turn of the\nrecension is obvious, and Mersenne, ready to use all means available\nto contradict the atheists, was not taken aback by the fact that these\nproofs belong to various, and sometimes adverse, theological\ntraditions. After summoning the consensus of all creatures, and the\nconsensus of all men, Mersenne resorted to cosmological arguments,\narguing, from the contingency of our word, and the contingency of our\nown finite existence, that \u201cit is necessary that something\nexists by itself\u201d. Here Mersenne borrowed from Hugues of Saint\nVictor and Jean Damascene.\n\nHe also presented at some length the Anselmian argument, arguing that\nexistence should be attributed to God, on account of the fact that the\nvery idea of God (that even the insane atheist should have in his\nmind) obliges us to consider that nothing greater can exist, and that\nexistence in re is obviously a greater thing than existence\nin the mind. Mersenne, who did not mention Aquinas\u2019s criticisms,\nfound the argument \u201cexcellent and very pious\u201d (QG: col\n37). He also paid much credit to the Augustinian argument from\n\u201ceternal truths\u201d\u2014Mathematical truths in particular\nwould not be possible without the supposition of an eternal mind in\nwhich they reside:\n\n\nopen your mind\u2019s eyes, \u00f4 atheist, and see how numerous and\nstrong are the arguments through which arithmetic asks you to embrace\nthe divine unity, without which Arithmetic would not hold, as all\nmaterial unity or numerical is impossible without the supposition of\ndivine unity. \u2026 One objects to the atheist\u2019s geometry, if\never one listens to Plato who recognizes God from this very science,\nas he said that God never ceases to practice geometry. (QG Praefatio:\na2)\n\n\nIt is to be noted that the two a priori arguments (from\neternal truths and from the idea of a perfect being) are the only two\nthat are brought in in the Impi\u00e9t\u00e9 to dispel atheism. In\nthe Quaestiones however more than half of Mersenne\u2019s\narguments were a posteriori ones: from the creation ex\nnihilo, from the beauty of creatures, from the given natural law,\nfrom the harmony of the universe\u2026 All allowed lengthy\nscientific excursuses, demonstrating God\u2019s intelligence and\nprovidence through whatever the sciences can show of the order of\nthings. Among these arguments, Mersenne paid only lip service to the\nclassical Aristotelian and Thomist \u201cargument from motion\u201d,\nwhich states that the world needs an immutable first mover, probably\nbecause he is aware that the argument had been used in Paduan\nAristotelianism in order to defend the coeternity of the world and its\nfirst mover. In the other a posteriori proofs, the regressive\nmove from the creation to the creator was not as likely to subject the\ncreator to the creation.\n\nProminent in the Quaestiones and\nImpi\u00e9t\u00e9, rational theology tended to recede in\nimportance in subsequent works. Although in the Quaestiones,\nMersenne had hinted at another work (\u201cperfectum\nopus\u201d) to come, it was never written. After 1624 he became\nmore reluctant to consider proofs of God\u2019s existence, hinting in\nhis correspondence with Ruarus that it might not be possible to give a\ntruly demonstrative one, however sensible and approved by everyone was\nthe truth of God\u2019s existence. His doubts were now on a par with\nthe ones he came to entertain regarding demonstrations in physical\nmatters. In his Questions th\u00e9ologiques, he wrote in a\nsomewhat autobiographical tone, that everyone could see for themselves\nthat:\n\n\nfresh from the Philosophy and Theology courses, they used to imagine\nthat they could give a reason for everything, whereas 20 or 30 years\nlater they are compelled to confess that they know no reason that\nsatisfies them and is so evident and certain that they cannot doubt\nit. (QT: 10)\n\n\nThis may shed some light on Mersenne\u2019s role in the writing of\nthe second objections to Descartes\u2019s Meditations, where\ndoubts were cast on the demonstrative character of the Cartesian\nproofs of God\u2019s existence, and especially on the ontological\nproof, whose Anselmian version was so much favoured by Mersenne in his\nyounger years. It has been argued (Garber 2001), quite convincingly,\nthat Jean-Baptiste Morin, a member of the Mersenne circle, and the\nauthor of a booklet on God\u2019s existence written in a geometrical\nfashion (Morin 1635) had an important hand in the composition of the\nsecond objections and that he was probably the one who suggested the\nrequest of presenting the Meditations arguments in a geometrical\nmanner. Mersenne, however would have concurred with the reservations,\nimplicit in this demand, concerning Descartes\u2019s claim to the\nhigher certainty of metaphysical demonstrations over mathematical\nones.\n3.3 Voluntarism\n\nVoluntarism was an important feature in Mersenne\u2019s apologetics.\nAgainst what appeared to him dangerous necessitarian tendencies in\nRenaissance naturalist philosophies, he repeatedly advocated\nGod\u2019s essential freedom in regard His creation. God chooses to\nexert his efficient, transitive causality in whatever way he will.\nThis for instance explains why Mersenne always opposed the idea of an\ninfinite universe. An infinite world, of the kind postulated by\nGiordano Bruno, would be very close to a necessary emanation of God,\nbut it is neither required of God\u2019s infinite power, nor does it\nagree with the nature of a created thing :\n\n\nall that is produced is finite but God\u2019s potentia is without\nmeasure. No created object is adequate to it. (QG: col. 435)\n\n\nMersenne maintained that God is not constrained by His infinite power.\nAs a free cause, he can chose to create a finite universe:\n\n\nwhy would God make a finite world, if He could make an infinite one?\nThe answer is: God did not want to do anything else than what he\ndid\u2014this however will not prevent us from believing He is all\npowerful, as we distinguish in God the work and the will [le faire\net le vouloir]\u2026 it is bad reasoning to conclude an\ninfinite effect from an infinite cause when the cause is not acting\nnecessarily but freely. (ID II: 304)\n\n\nFor Mersenne the unique perfect egalitarian emanation of God would be\nan action ad intra, that is the action through which God\ncontemplates (and loves) Himself in the persons of the trinity. When\none comes to causality ad extra, such as creation, one has to\ndistinguish (ID II: 311\u20132) between divine power and divine will.\nThe first contains and addresses infinite possibilities, the second\nchooses, from among them, a finite assortment.\n\nVoluntarism concerning the nature and laws of creation may appear as\nan important common ground that Mersenne shared with orthodox\n(Thomist) scholasticism, and with Descartes. As Lenoble has shown, its\nassertion was an essential precondition for the establishment of a\nmechanical science, unifying the whole of nature under the contingent\nwill of God, his initial decisions regarding the distribution and laws\nof matter and motion. Mersenne\u2019s voluntarism implies that\nphysics is not about an eternal and immutable object, as God could\nhave ordered the word in various manners and with various laws. This,\nas we shall see, has important epistemological consequences:\nGod\u2019s freedom means that he is not compelled to create things in\nthe simplest fashion. This is evidenced in the reign of the grace,\nwhere one can clearly see that God did not chose the shortest way to\ndispense his grace, as he could have assured our salvation with a\nunique act of his will (cf. Questions Inou\u00efes, p.\n344\u20135] But this hold as well for scientific truths, and explains\nfor example why Mersenne never considered as decisive Galilean and\nCopernican arguments for the motion of the earth taken from the\nsimplicity of natural order. Mersenne\u2019s point was actually quite\nclose to the argument from divine omnipotence that Pope Urban VIII\nsuggested to Galileo in 1623, and that Galileo, somewhat ironically,\nput in the mouth of Simplicio in the concluding sentences of the 1632\nDialogo: Man cannot presume to know how the world really is,\nsince God could have brought about the same effects in ways unimagined\nby humans (see Galileo, 1890\u20131909, VII, 488).\n3.4 Mersenne and Descartes on Eternal Truths\n\nMersenne did not extend his voluntarism to mathematical truths, as\nDescartes did in a rather unconventional way. The confrontation of\nMersenne\u2019s and Descartes\u2019s positions on this theme has\nbeen the object of some discussions in the secondary\nliterature\u2014see especially Marion 1980; Dear 1988; Carraud 1994;\nFabbri 2008. Descartes first assertions on God\u2019s creation of\nmathematical truths appeared in a letter to Mersenne of April 15,\n1630. Descartes enjoined his correspondent to tell everyone aloud that\nthe mathematical truths that Mersenne called eternal were not\nindependent of God, but \u201chave been created by him and depend on\nhim entirely just as do all the other creatures\u201d (Descartes to\nMersenne, April 15, 1630, AT I: 145). God freely established them, and\nimpressed them in the minds of men, as a king would in his kingdom.\nThe statement seems to have surprised Mersenne. The Minim\u2019s own\nletters are lost, but this can be inferred from the fact that\nDescartes in May and June 1630, obviously answers repeated requests\nfor clarification:\n\n\nyou ask me in quo genere causae Deus disposuit aeternas\nveritates [in what kind of cause God has disposed the eternal\ntruths]. I reply to you that it is in eodem genere causae [in\nthe same kind of cause] that he has created everything, that is ut\nefficients et totalis causa [as efficient and total cause].\n(Descartes to Mersenne, May 27 1630, AT I: 151\u20132).\n\nYou ask what necessitated God to create these truths; and I reply that\nhe was free to make it not true that all the radii of the circle are\nequal\u2014just as free as he was not to create the world. (27 mai\n1630, AT I: 152)\n\n\nMersenne\u2019s own considerations on the status of eternal truths in\nGod\u2019s intellect explain why he should have had qualms about\nDescartes\u2019s puzzling doctrine (which might amount here to no\nless than making mathematical truths somehow contingent, depending on\nthe arbitrary will of God\u2014even though Descartes himself, who\noften points out the necessity of mathematical truths, never draws\nsuch consequence). Mersenne position seems closer to cardinal de\nBerulle\u2019s, and Augustine\u2019s exemplarism: eternal\ntruths are exemplar ideas present in God\u2019s intellect and\nilluminating our own. They proceed from God\u2019s nature as His\nVerb, but they are not similar to creatures, they are not\n\u201cfreely\u201d created.\n\nWhen Mersenne considers God\u2019s relation to eternal truth he often\nuses metaphors of light and the emanatist vocabulary of\nNeo-Platonism\u2014for example in the Trait\u00e9 de\nl\u2019harmonie Universelle:\n\n\nI consider, therefore the divine essence as an eternal and infinite\nsun, which darts an infinity of rays on which depend all our\nperfections: the goodness of God is one of these rays, whence come\nour good inclinations, our virtues and our good works, the other is\neternal truth, whence proceed all our truths and our sciences. (THU:\n59\u201360, English translation in Dear 1988: 58)\n\n\nOr in the Questions th\u00e9ologiques:\n\nthe sciences are like the rays of divinity, and it is just as\nblameable to try to know them without God, than try to know the nature\nof colours, without knowing the nature of light, which gives them\nbeing and subsistence. (QT: 202)\n\nThe kind of causality implied here is a causality ad intra:\neternal truths belong to God\u2019s nature. And in this regard, as\nthey are \u201cformally\u201d in God and so to speak coeternal with\nHim, they should be considered as uncreated and necessitated, as God\nhimself is not free towards His own nature:\n\n\nIt is patent that God is entirely free in regard everything that are\ncontained only eminently in him, to produce them or not, as He is\ndriven necessarily to whatever he embraces formerly as these things\nthat are God himself are infinite, eternal, independent. (QG: col\n436)\n\n\nThe idea that eternal truths exist necessarily in God, and do not\ndepend on God\u2019s causality was not new, and Mersenne here\nbelonged to a rather well established scholastic tradition. An\noriginal feature of Mersenne\u2019s position however is that he\nconsidered mathematical truths as the very paradigm of eternal truths.\nAs pointed by Dear, this was not a received doctrine. Mathematics used\nto be considered not really worthy of the dignity of true sciences, on\naccount of the inessential nature of their object and the non-causal\ncharacter of their demonstrations. Mersenne, in the wake of Biancani\n(1615) defended the contrary view: mathematics are not only true\nsciences, but the highest among them, because of their certainty.\nBesides, their demonstrations are truly causal ones, as Mersenne\nshowed with the example of numbers where unity appears to be the\n\u201cmaterial cause\u201d and the intellect, conjoining and\ncomposing unities, the \u201cefficient\u201d one (cf. VS II: 284).\nThus mathematics is able to describe the objects that God\u2019s\nintellect considered when He created the world, that is the possibilia\n(Lenoble 1943)\u2014or, better said, mathematics are the sciences of\nthe metaphysically necessary attributes of all things.\n\nOne important question that has been debated in the literature is\nwhether Mersenne\u2019s position amounts to the idea that\nmathematical truths are truly independent of God. The discussion is\nnot merely about the meaning one is willing to give to the word\n\u201cindependent\u201d whether it applies or not to something that\nis included in God\u2019s nature, but it engages deep issues in the\nhistory of metaphysical thought. According to Marion (1980), and\nCarraud (1994), the very fact that mathematical truths are considered\nas forming the essence of God\u2019s intellect means that they do not\ndepend anymore on God\u2019s will. Apparently endorsing a doctrine\nthat he found mentioned in Su\u00e1rez (1597, xxxi.12.40), Mersenne\nwrote in a much discussed passage of the Quaestiones:\n\n\nas other authors say, things are possible per se, independently of any\ncause, in virtue of the necessary connection and non-contradiction of\nterms. (col. 436)\n\n\nGod would be subjected to mathematical truths just as human intellects\nare. He would know them as we know them. This would be the sign that\nthe doctrine of univocity entered Mersenne\u2019s thought, perhaps\nunder the influence of Kepler, in an irretrievable fashion. This is\nalso deemed to explain the striking disappearance of rational theology\nin Mersenne\u2019s writings. Just as metaphysics had been entirely\nexhausted by natural theology in the first works, rational theology\nended up being entirely exhausted by mathematics. The latter are not\nanymore an analogical resource for theology, but indeed they furnish\nthe only possible non-analogical discourse on God, \u201cthe hidden\nobject of all mathematical discourse\u201d (Pessel 1987). As a\nconsequence, Mersenne\u2019s apologetics no longer needs to appeal to\nrational theology\u2014the mere promotion of mathematical sciences\nhas become the unique, or best, apology of Christian religion.\n\nPeter Dear criticized Marion\u2019s interpretation as implying\nsomething that he did not find in Mersenne, namely that mathematical\ntruths exist in a kind of platonic separateness, so that God and men\nwould be in the same relation to them, would see them the same way.\nThis would imply that God is no more the author of them than men,\nwhereas in Dear\u2019s view, Mersenne, always firmly maintained that\neternal truths causally depend on God, being true emanations of his\nnature. Accordingly, Mersenne would not so much insist on independence\nbut rather on co-implication and coeternity. Whereas Descartes used\nto\n\n\nsee the matter as straight choice between necessary truths holding\nsimply because God knew them (having willed them) or God\u2019s\nknowing them because they are independently true. (cf. Descartes\n\u00e0 Mersenne 6 mai 1630, Descartes AT I: 149, and Dear 1988:\n60)\n\n\nMersenne, a rather orthodox scholastic on this point, never recognized\nan alternative: both theses should hold together\u2014eternal truths\nare true because God knows them, and God knows them because they are\ntrue.\n4. Epistemological Issues\n4.1 Against the Skeptics\n\nMersenne\u2019s attitude towards skepticism was complex, changing\nover time and somewhat ambivalent. In L\u2019Usage de la\nraison\u2014a recently rediscovered booklet from 1623, whose\nauthorship does not seem questionable\u2014one finds arguments\nagainst the vanity of the sciences that are strongly reminiscent of\nthose expressed around the same time by \u201cChristian\nskeptics\u201d, such as Montaigne and Charron, or even Cornelius\nAgrippa, authors whom Mersenne sternly criticized in his next\npublications. Thus, in the \u201cDedicatory Epistle to Madame de\nVitry\u201d, the Minim suggested that our time is badly employed in\nstudying the sciences, which are plagued with insuperable\nuncertainty:\n\n\nwhenever we raise our eyes to the sky or incline it to the earth, we\nmust owe that everything is unknown to us\u2026 Who can claim to\nknow the number of the skies, their form, their matter, properties and\naccident? One can even find idle-dreamers Copernicans prepared to deny\nthe motion of the skies\u2026 Who can say if Alchemists are right in\ntheir promises.\n\n\nThis uncertainty of the \u201cmegalocosm\u201d goes together with an\nequal puzzlement concerning the littlest creature of the micro-world,\nas recent microscopes have shown to the eye that \u201cit is pure\nignorance to say that they are deprived of these several organs that\ncan be seen in larger creatures\u201d. Further, (UR: 37\u201338) the\nauthor condemned Pythagoras, Archimedes, the alchemists, the\nalgebraists, etc. for being so much attached to their inventions that\nthey forget to think of God, and eternal glory\u2026\n\nThe change of attitude in the next published works is striking. On the\none hand, in the Quaestiones and\nImpi\u00e9t\u00e9, skepticism was presented as a sequel\nto Calvinism; and the denunciation of human reason found in Charron\nand Montaigne, far from encouraging faith in the mysteries of\nChristian religion, was seen as inclining men towards atheism and\nlibertinism. On the other hand, Mersenne was no longer denouncing the\nsciences indistinctly as vain curiosity, his general attitude towards\nspeculative enquiry was much more positive, especially when one came\nto the mathematical sciences, whose apologetic virtues he wanted now\nto reveal. He maintained however that our reason is weak,\ncontradictory, particularly in regard philosophical (i.e., physical)\nissues:\n\n\nif our reasons were not deceitful, how would it come that there is not\nany one question in Philosophy, that does not raise diverse opinions\nwholly contrary on the same subjects, all of which have their reason\nand nevertheless there is only one that is true. (ID II: 672)\n\n\nIn La V\u00e9rit\u00e9 des sciences contre les sceptiques et\nles phyrroniens, the tone changed again. Skepticism was no longer\ncondemned as a seed of heterodoxy but only in so far as it discourages\nmen from the practice of mathematical sciences. The skeptical\ncharacter is obstinate, but he is no atheist nor heretic in the\ndisguise (see Descotes, in VS, Introduction), and in the first part of\nthe book, his arguments against the alchemist\u2019s dogmatism are\noften endorsed and even reinforced by the Christian philosopher.\n\nAgainst the epistemological optimism of the alchemist who considers\nhimself to be in possession of the perfect science, the skeptic\nresorts to the traditional arguments of the academic school,\nemphasizing that certainty is nowhere to be found, as we have only a\nvery partial and superficial knowledge of things. We perceive only the\neffects and not the profound nature nor the ultimate causes of things.\nThe true essences evade us. The simplest objects (such as a sheet of\npaper) cannot be completely known, because of the infinite number of\nrelations in which they are involved with other elements of the\nuniverse. It has been shown by G. Paganini that these arguments and\nexamples are almost verbatim borrowed from the \u201csecond\ndoubt\u201d of Campanella\u2019s Metaphysica, a manuscript\nthat was in Mersenne\u2019s hands at the time he wrote La\nV\u00e9rit\u00e9 des sciences, but that he did not mention as\nhis source (Paganini 2005 & 2008).\n\nIn chapter 11 and 12, the Christian philosopher presents the skeptical\narguments in a new and more radical form. He gives an account of the\nten skeptical tropes of Aenesideme, as Mersenne could have read them\nin Sextus Empiricus and Diog\u00e8ne Laertius. These tropes draw on\nthe varieties of animal constitution in regard pleasures and pains,\nthe idiosyncrasy of men, the disagreement of the senses, the varieties\nof circumstances and dispositions, such as health and disease, sleep\nand wakefulness, young age and old age. All show that the information\nof our senses is unreliable, just as the reasons we draw from\nthem.\n\nIn answer to these doubts, Mersenne\u2019s Christian philosopher\nresorts to an eclectic strategy. On the one hand, he adopts the usual\nAristotelian standpoint against skepticism regarding the senses: sense\nperception is trustworthy, provided that its exercise takes place in\n\u201cnormal\u201d and appropriate conditions. Errors occur only\nwhen the senses are affected by disease, or presented with objects\nwhose distance, illumination, intensity, etc. exceed the normal\nrange:\n\n\nAll the deceptions of senses that you object are of no use, for they\nonly prove what we concede, namely that each one of our senses, in\norder to judge its object rightly must have all that its nature and\nthe perfection of its operation require\u2014this granted, it never\nerrs. (VS I: 15)\n\n\nOn the other hand, just as senses are the right judges of their own\nproper sensible\u2014the eye of color and light, the ear of sound,\netc.\u2014human intellect also possesses an internal criterion which\nallows it to judge its own objects rightly. It has the use of \u201ca\nspiritual and universal light that it has of its own nature since the\ncommencement of its creation\u201d (VS: 193). Here the inspiration is\nclearly Augustinian, as it is for Descartes\u2019s parent conception\nof \u201clumi\u00e8re naturelle\u201d. The light of the soul does\nnot give men direct access to divine knowledge, knowledge of essences,\nas that would require an eternal glory and a supernatural light. But\nit still gives access to a number of evidentia, immediate\ncertainties, whose truth, Mersenne concedes, depends on God\u2019s\nillumination and God\u2019s veracity. Thus, in every realm of\nknowledge or human interests, there are truths that are not capable of\ndoubt, such as \u201cthe whole is greater than the part\u201d, or\n\u201cevil should be avoided\u201d.\n\nAnother Augustinian aspect of Mersenne\u2019s defense is the idea\nthat doubt itself can be turned into a source of knowledge. For\nexample, although there are differences in apprehension between\nvarious men, or between men and beasts, we do have the knowledge of\nsuch differences and this is something that cannot be doubted:\n\u201cat least one knows that the objects of the senses appear\ndifferently according to the diverse dispositions of the organs\u201d\n(VS: 193). Awareness of this sort of facts is what incites men to seek\nthe laws of appearances\u2014for example, the optical and geometrical\nrules that govern variations in perspective. In other terms, it\nprompts them to engage into physico-mathematical enquiries.\n\nOn a similar line of argument, one could say, following Augustine in\nDe Civitate Dei (1998, chapter XI, 26) that one cannot doubt\nthat one doubts, unless admitting an infinite regress:\n\n\nI do not believe you doubt that [that we can learn science, with great\ncontentment] because you experience this every day in yourself, and if\nyou doubt it I ask whether you know that you are doubting; if you know\nit, you must know something, and consequently you do not doubt\neverything; an if you doubt that you doubted, I shall force you to\nadmit infinite regress, which you say you reject, so that wherever you\ngo, you must confess that there is some truth, and consequently you\nmust say farewell to your Pyrrhonism. (VS I: 204)\n\n\nIn the next decade, reacting to the cogito argument in the\nDiscours de la M\u00e9thode, Mersenne pointed out to\nDescartes how close his use of radical doubt was to that Augustinian\nargument (see Gouhier 1978).\n4.2 Mitigated Skepticism and Probabilism\n\nRichard Popkin has remarked that the great originality of La\nV\u00e9rit\u00e9 des sciences resides not so much in its\narguments against the skeptics, as in the fact that this defense of\n\u201cthe truth of the sciences\u201d concedes so much to the\nskeptical outlook. Most of the skeptical claims that are propounded\neither by the skeptic or by the Christian philosopher are not really\nrefuted in the book. They are integrated in a novel view of what one\nshould expect of scientific enquiry, its true aims and prospects\n(Popkin 1956, 2003).\n\nThus, the Christian philosopher has no qualm with the skeptical\nrebuttal of the alchemist\u2019s claim to perfect knowledge in\nnatural matters. He freely admits that we cannot know everything, and\nespecially not the causes nor essences of physical things, that\nmen\u2019s capacity is limited by outward appearance and the surface\nof corporeal things. In the Questions inou\u00efes, Mersenne\nwent as far as to say that we cannot demonstrate the existence of the\nexternal world:\n\n\nAnd we do not have any demonstration by which we are able to persuade\nthe opinion of those who might maintain that the earth, the water, the\nstars, and all the bodies which we see are but appearances and\n\u201cspecies intentionales\u201d, supposing God might use these\nspecies or accidents to make all that we see appear to us. For one is\nnot able to say that one knows a single thing as one\nshould\u2014according to the laws and the notions which Aristotle and\nother philosophers give of science\u2014if one cannot demonstrate\nthat it is impossible that the reason which one supplies, or the thing\nwhich one proposes, be not true. That is enough to persuade those who\nuse reflection that there is nothing certain in physics and that there\nare so few certain things, that it is difficult to propound\nany\u2026 (QI XVIII: 53, translated in Mace 1970: 24\u201325)\n\n\nMersenne joins the skeptic in his condemnation of the\nAristotelian\u2019s far too optimistic view of science. What is\ndenounced is not so much Aristotle\u2019s physical doctrines or\nmethods (the Christian philosopher, for example, does not endorse the\nskeptical attacks against syllogistic) but rather a mistaken\nrepresentation of the epistemic aims of physics, which cannot aspire\nto perfect certainty. Bacon\u2019s experimental method received no\nmore favor in his eyes precisely on this account, as it serves a\nproject that is no less dogmatic (see Buccolini 2013):\n\n\nalthough one may anatomize, and dissolve bodies as much as one wishes,\nwhether by fire, by water, or by the force of the mind, one will never\narrive at the point of rendering our intellect equal to the nature of\nthings. That is why I believe that Verulam design is impossible. (VS\n212)\n\n\nMersenne did not think that our inability to understand the ultimate\ncause and intimate nature of things should be an object of lament. The\nmere knowledge of effects and appearances might be enough for human\nneeds. For one thing, it has enough pragmatic virtue, as it can serve\nus as a guide in our actions. Besides, as outwards appearances, crust\nand superficies may be rigorously described, through measurement and\nmathematics, the sort of knowledge that can be gained here is as\nperfect and certain as one could wish\u2014although not of the sort\ndogmatic physicians and metaphysicians are seeking.\n\nThus, according to Richard Popkin, Mersenne is not so much refuting\nskepticism as he is adopting an attenuated form of it. By openly\ndiscarding research on the causes and essences of phenomena, reducing\nthe whole of physical science to mathematical knowledge of accidents,\nthe study of external effects, and the establishment of the laws of\nappearances, he invents a \u201cmitigated skepticism\u201d, that\nPopkin considers as the first lucid expression of the modern\nscientific outlook, deemed to become dominant in the following\ncenturies. This outlook conjugates an entire confidence in the virtues\nof physico-mathematical sciences, with a complete positivism (that is,\na deliberate abstention) in regard metaphysical matters.\n\nRecent reappraisals of Mersenne\u2019s epistemological views tend to\ncontest, or at least qualify, Popkin\u2019s characterizations.\nAccording to Garber (2004), Mersenne\u2019s epistemological frame is\nold rather than new. The way he envisions the boundaries between\ndisciplines remains Aristotelian, and in particular his conception of\nthe \u201cphysico-mathematical\u201d sciences directly comes from\nthe Aristotelian definition of mixed or subaltern mathematics,\nsciences such as astronomy or optics, only dealing with accident and\nsurface properties of physical things. Far from offering a scientific\nsubstitute to Aristotelian physics, these sciences allow one to\napproach nature in a mathematical way \u201cwithout having to\nchallenge the full complex of Aristotelianism directly\u201d (2004:\n157) in ways that would be perceived as subversive of true religion\nand social order.\n\nDear\u2019s study (1988) similarly insists on the deliberately\n\u201cun-revolutionary\u201d character of Mersenne\u2019s\ncontribution to the \u201cscientific revolution\u201d. Mersenne\nnever chose to range himself against Aristotelianism, never cast\nhimself as an innovator. His agenda is formulated in a preexisting\nphilosophical idiom (the \u201clanguage of the schools\u201d), and\nhis ideas display a \u201cborrowed coherence\u201d rather than an\nintrinsic one. Mersenne was not a positivist avant la lettre;\nhe admitted that God knows what man cannot verify, that natural kinds\nexist in nature, that things do have essential definitions. His\n\u201cskeptical\u201d approach to physics is not so much a\nwatered-down Pyrrhonism intended to show the inconclusiveness of\nnatural philosophical demonstration, as it is an instrument to\nrecommend mathematical sciences as an anchor of certainty, where\nordinary natural philosophy stays in doubt and can only be defended in\na probabilistic way. When Mersenne confesses that many questions\ncannot he determined, he is not proposing to suspend judgment but\nrather to formulate a probable judgment by choosing the most\npersuasive opinions. This \u201cprobabilism\u201d is, according to\nDear, a legacy of humanist and Ciceronian dialectics, and it remained\nconstantly present in Mersenne\u2019s work, even though, on some\nquestions the weight of probabilities has changed. This was\nparticularly the case for the Copernican opinion. Judging it very\nunlikely in L\u2019Usage de la raison and in the\nQuaestiones, Mersenne eventually recognized that it was the\nopinion best suited to the phenomena observed and therefore the most\nprobable. However, God\u2019s freedom being never constrained,\nMersenne could accept with relative equanimity the final judgment of\nthe Church. In his Questions th\u00e9ologiques, he was to\npublish a French translation of the inquisitorial condemnation and of\nGalileo\u2019s abjuration.\n\nDeparting from Garber and Dear\u2019s view as well as from\nPopkin\u2019s, Buccolini (2019) presents Mersenne\u2019s\nepistemological reflection in La v\u00e9rit\u00e9 des\nsciences as resolutely anti-sceptical, and strongly connected\nwith the views expressed by the Jesuit mathematician, Guiseppe\nBiancani, in his dissertation on the nature of mathematics (Biancani\n1615), arguing for the certainty and scientific status of mathematics.\nAccording to Buccolini, Mersenne\u2019s doubts are directed not\nagainst science as such but against the Aristotelian doctrine of\ndemonstratio, his aim being to replace Aristotelian physics\nwith an entirely intelligible mathematical physics.\n4.3 Mechanism and Experimentalism\n\nAccording to Lenoble (1943), Mersenne\u2019s mature works, focusing\nalmost exclusively on \u201cphysico-mathematical\u201d sciences,\nwitnesses the \u201cbirth of mechanism\u201d. However, as the term\nis not an actor\u2019s category of the 17th century, one should be\ncareful in its use. Formulated in its own terms, Mersenne\u2019s\nstandpoint regarding explanations in physics is that we can only\nunderstand what we can do:\n\n\nwe only know the real reasons for things that we can create with our\nhand and our mind; \u2026 and of all the things made by God, we\ncannot create any, no matter how much subtlety and effort we apply.\n(NO: 8; Lenoble 1943: 384)\n\n\nThis indicates both the foundations and limits of mechanistic\nexplanations: finding reasons means showing how things can he produced\nby mechanical actions\u2014actions of the kind we are capable of when\napplying our bodies to external bodies. On the one hand, however, this\nmode of genetic explanation can provide only a very superficial\nclarification of created things, whose construction and complexity are\neither infinite, or go to details and minutiae that our senses are\nincapable of perceiving (OC: 89). On the other hand, these\nexplanations cannot bear the character of necessity since they focus\non objects that are fundamentally contingent and whose inner machinery\ncould have been constituted differently, had God so wanted:\n\n\none knows all but nothing in physics, if one follows the definition of\nscience Aristotle gave; for if it ought to be about eternal and\nimmutable objects, and God can change everything that is in physics,\none cannot make a science of it. (QT: 9)\n\n\nThe conjoined effects of Mersenne\u2019s epistemological pessimism\nand metaphysical voluntarism make his version of\n\u201cmechanism\u201d very different from the Cartesian, Hobbesian\nor Gassendist one. He never conceived mechanical explanations as a new\nscience of \u201ccauses\u201d, based on the adoption of new\nprinciples and elements intended to take the place of Aristotelian\nsubstantial forms\u2014such as Descartes\u2019s subtle matter or\nGassendi\u2019s atoms. Mechanics, as all other mixed-mathematics, was\nsimply concerned with establishing the laws of phenomena.\n\nThis reflection on nature and the limits of mechanistic science was\naccompanied by truly experimental activity. Mersenne was convinced\nthat mathematical sciences of nature cannot settle for common and\nvague observation. It urgently required \u201cwell-controlled and\nwell-performed experiments\u201d (HU I: 167), facts that were\nartificially generated and precisely measured. Mersenne was aware\nthat, even when rigorously performed, an experiment is not always\nenough to establish the law of phenomena: two series of experiments\ncan diverge very little and yet express very different laws.\nMeasurement can only be approximated, and this has a bearing on the\ncertainty of mixed mathematics, which is partially compromised to the\nextent that it deals with physical objects. Reason must therefore, as\nfar as possible, always accompany and discipline observation, without\nwhich one is vulnerable to considerable misunderstandings.\n\nMersenne made a considerable effort to do and redo experiments that\nhis predecessors (most notably Galileo) had not always had the sense\nto present precisely. Thus, on the subject of the increase in speed\nduring falling motion on an inclined plane, he conducted a precise\ncampaign of measurements that enabled him to criticize Galileo\u2019s\nnumerical results, and eventually express doubts on the validity of\nthe law itself (Palmerini 2010). As usual, he expressed his\nreservations concerning our capacity to determine with certainty the\ncauses of gravity: \u201cit is just as difficult to find the real\ncause as to demonstrate whether the earth is stable or mobile\u201d\n(Trait\u00e9 des mouvements) and he placed back-to-back the\nreasons put forward by his contemporaries\u2014positive and real\nquality, air pressure, magnetic attraction\u2014which could only\npartially account for the phenomenon in its precise numerical\ndimensions. As Peter Dear has shown, Mersenne\u2019s approach to the\nscience of motion was inductive in nature, not centered, as it was in\nGalileo, on the abstract physical process, but rather on \u201ca\ngeneralized description of cases, whose details and precise parameters\nheld an importance altogether lacking in Galileo\u201d (Dear\n1994).\n5. Music and Universal Harmony\n\nOf all the mixed-mathematical disciplines in which Mersenne took an\ninterest, music was undeniably the one to which he devoted the most\neffort and passion. His 1623 Quaestiones already included a\nlong musicological digression on the therapeutic power attributed to\nthe music of the Hebrews, and generally to the music of the Ancients,\nwhose harmonics he dreamed of restoring. The idea was taken up and\ndeveloped in the 1627 Trait\u00e9 de l\u2019harmonie\nuniverselle, published under the transparent pseudonym of\n\u201cSieur de Sermes\u201d. The science of intellectual music and\nthe understanding of the proportions that govern nature, lost through\nnegligence, must be restored and linked to the science of\n\u201csensual music\u201d, which addresses our hearing but which,\nseparated from the former, is no longer able to fulfill its true\nfunction: elevating the senses above material objects, rather than\nlinking them together. Mersenne\u2019s great work on musical theory,\nthe eight books of Harmonie Universelle, was published from\n1636 to 1637. It presents a great many editorial variants, as Mersenne\nnever ceased to work on it, annotating his own copy. The important\n\u201cTrait\u00e9 de la nature du son\u201d, which constitutes the\nfirst part of the work, focuses on the study, undertaken in a\nmechanistic spirit, of acoustic quantities, their physical nature and\ntheir effects on physiology and passions. Mersenne, drawing on Isaac\nBeeckman, establishes experimentally the laws connecting the\nvibration, the length and tension of the strings, making an important\ncontribution to acoustic science.\n\nEpistemological, metaphysical and aesthetic aspects are intertwined in\nMersenne\u2019s musical agenda. Music was to Mersenne a\nmixed-mathematical science, just as astronomy, whose primary aim was\nto \u201csave the phenomena\u201d through more or less plausible\nhypotheses. The musical phenomena par excellence is\n\u201cconsonance\u201d, that is the fact that certain sounds put\ntogether are agreeable to the ear. Recent musical practices, new\ninstruments and polyphonic music had disclosed new modes of consonance\nthat were previously unknown, and Mersenne saw his proper task in an\neffort to find the best physico-mathematical hypotheses that would be\nable to account for them, and could be used to invent more\n\u201cperfect\u201d musical pieces (chants). Seeking such\nhypotheses, Mersenne relentlessly asked his correspondents how they\ncould account for the fact that certain sounds put together are\nagreeable and others not. For example, in November 1627, he asked a\ncorrespondent in Rome:\n\n\nIf the said Galileus be at Rome or if you should know some other\nexcellent mathematician-musician, I pray you to find out from him why,\nof all the sounds put together, only those which form the octave, the\nfifth, the third, and the sixth and their replicas are agreeable to\nthe ear, and which of all the dissonances is the most disagreeable one\nand why. I have been told that the said Galilei knows this reason. (MC\nI: 603, translated in Mace 1970: 8)\n\n\nMersenne\u2019s own general hypothesis was that consonance was due to\nthe coincidence of the vibrations of the air, which itself depended on\ncertain exact ratios in the mechanical properties of the instrument,\ne.g., the length, tension and breadth of the strings. However, as\nconsonance was judged by the ear rather than directly by reason,\ndiscrepancies were found. For example, experiments showed that the ear\nhears an octave when the tensions of the strings are in a ratio of 1\nto 4.25, whereas the physico-mathematical, Pythagorean, hypothesis\nprescribed 1 to 4. So here one would have to find ways to correct, or\n\u201cdiscipline\u201d experience through reason, in a move that is\nquite typical of Mersenne\u2019s epistemology (see Dear 1988).\n\nIn spite of those discrepancies, Mersenne was truly fascinated by the\nfact that the human mind, in its musical appreciation, is so to speak\nattuned to mathematical harmonies. The perception of consonance\nalthough mediated (and perhaps distorted) by our feeling, is not mere\nsensual pleasure, as Descartes, for example, seemed to think. Properly\nunderstood, it has a rational dimension, as it discloses to men the\n\u201cuniversal harmony\u201d, the underlying mathematical order\nthat is present at every level of reality, and that connects them\ntogether. Mersenne could have found in Kepler\u2019s Harmonices\nmundi the idea of such an archetypal harmony, ordering each level\nof reality, and innate to the human mind. He did not accept however\nKepler\u2019s rather dismissive view of music, which had led him to\ndefine harmonics in purely geometrical terms, stripped from whatever\nis sensorial and \u201cacoustic\u201d in it.\n\nContrary to what is sometimes held, the seeming adoption of an\nintegral mechanism in the last musical works is no renunciation of the\nmetaphysical consideration in harmonics. According to De Buzon (1994:\n127, my translation), the causes and effects of consonance are indeed\ntreated physically, but the pleasure taken to harmonics, \u201calbeit\nan ordinary experience, is a phenomenon that is entirely\ntheological\u201d. Musical pleasure shows both our destination and\nour state in this world. It raises us to the contemplation of the\ndivine unity, which is so to speak embodied in musical unison:\n\n\nconsonances depend on the unison as lines on the point, number on\nunity, and creatures on God. That is why the more they approach it the\nsweeter they become; because consonances have nothing sweet nor\nagreeable but that which they borrow from union of their sounds, which\nis the greater as it approaches unison. (HU II: Livre Premier des\nconsonances, 15, translated in Mace 1970: 13)\n\n\nBut musical pleasure also reveals our imperfect and sensuous nature.\nThus, for instance, although \u201cunison\u201d is the simplest and\nmost divine harmony, we tend to prefer in this world other, less\nperfect consonances and even dissonance.\n\nIn considering the general interconnection of sciences, Mersenne\ngranted music an almost architectonic function. All the sciences\nborrow something from each other. As manifested in the encyclopedic\ncharacter of the Harmonie Universelle, music was for Mersenne\nas the connecting principle of the various disciplines, allowing for\ntheir exposition. A thorough investigation of musical properties\nrequires forays into theology, moral philosophy (the passions of the\nsoul), optics, arithmetic and geometry, and of course mechanics as\nsounds are motions of the air, that have to be accounted for in a\nmechanical way. Conversely, and at a deeper level, music may be seen\nas a total science, theoretically capable of representing the\nproportions that exist between all parts of the mechanical\nuniverse:\n\n\nit is also easy to conclude that one can represent everything in the\nworld and, consequently all the sciences, by means of Sound; for,\nsince everything consists in weight, number and measure, and sounds\nrepresent these three properties, they can signify anything one\nwishes, excluding metaphysics. (HU 1: 43)\n\n\nIn particular music may teach men how, through motions, objects\ncommunicate their properties to the senses, which themselves are like\ninstruments, more or less well attuned to the external motions of the\nsensible. Music would then become the general science of the\nproperties of the sensible, a kind of general aesthesis uniting mixed\nmathematics in one universal science, whose acquisition would make our\nelevation to the consideration of the first cause easier (QT:\n161).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Mersenne\u2019s works and abbreviations", "Other Primary sources", "Secondary sources"], "cat_ref_text": {"Mersenne\u2019s works and abbreviations": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "1623 [UR], <em>L\u2019Usage de la raison</em>, Paris.
