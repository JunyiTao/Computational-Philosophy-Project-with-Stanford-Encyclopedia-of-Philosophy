    "main_text": "Recognizing capacity, complexity\n5.   Recognizing capacity, complexity\nReflecting on the above, one can say that the extensions of the\nsyntactic calculus reviewed here are motivated by the desire to find a\nproper balance between expressivity and computational\ntractability: on the side of expressivity, an adequate\ntypelogical framework should be able to recognize patterns beyond the\nstrictly context-free; ideally, one would like to keep such\nexpressivity compatible with a polynomial derivability problem.  Among\ncontemporary \u2018lexicalized\u2019 grammar formalisms, there is a\nremarkable convergence on systems that meet these requirements: the\nso-called \u2018mildly context-sensitive\u2019 systems (Joshi,\nVijay-Shanker, and Weir 1991).  Where can we situate the typelogical\nsystems discussed here with respect to recognizing capacity and\ncomplexity?\nThe minimal system in the typelogical hierarchy NL has a\npolynomial recognition problem (see de Groote 1999, and Capelletti\n2007 for actual parsing algorithms), but it is strictly context-free\n(Kandulski 1988).  Extensions with global structural rules are\nunsatisfactory, both on the expressivity and on the complexity front.\nAs for L, Pentus (1993b, 2006) shows that it remains strictly\ncontext-free, whereas the addition of global associativity makes the\nderivability problem NP complete.  NP completeness already holds for\nthe product-free fragment of L (Savateev 2009).  Also\nfor LP, i.e., multiplicative intuitionistic linear logic, we\nhave NP completeness (Kanovich 1994).  With regard to recognizing\ncapacity, van Benthem (1995) shows that LP recognizes all\npermutation closures of context-free languages: a class which is too\nwide from the syntactic point of view.  As the logic of\nmeaning assembly, LP is a core component of the\ntypelogical inventory.  But as we saw in the discussion of the\nsyntax-semantics interface, we can restrict attention to the\nsublanguage of LP that forms the image of derivations in\nsyntactic calculi making interesting claims about word order and\nphrase structure.\nThe situation of the multimodal and symmetric extensions is more\nintricate. Expressivity here is directly related to the kind of\nrestrictions one imposes on structural resource management. At one end\nof the spectrum, multimodality without structural rules does not lead\nus beyond context-free recognition: J\u00e4ger (2003) shows that the\npure residuation logic for n-ary families of type-forming\noperations stays strictly context-free. If one requires structural\nrules to be resource-sensitive (no copying or deletion) and,\nfor the unary modalities, non-expanding, one obtains the full\nexpressivity of context-sensitive grammars, and the PSPACE complexity\nthat goes with it (Moot 2002). (PSPACE consists of those problems \nsolvable using some polynomial amount of memory space.  See the entry on \n computability and complexity.\n If one imposes no restrictions on structural rules (specifically, if\none allows copying and deletion operations), unsurprisingly, one\nobtains the expressivity of unrestricted rewriting systems (Carpenter\n1999). A controlled use of copying is used in the analysis of\nanaphora resolution in J\u00e4ger 2005.\nThe symmetric calculus LG without interaction\nprinciples is context-free, as shown in Bastenhof 2010.  For the\nsystem with the interaction principles of \u00a73.3, Melissen\n(2009) shows that all languages which are the intersection of a\ncontext- free language and the permutation closure of a context-free\nlanguage are recognizable in LG. In this class, we find\ngeneralized forms of MIX (the language consisting of an equal number\nof symbols a, b, c, in any order), with\nequal multiplicity of k alphabet symbols in any order, and\ncounting dependencies\n an1\u2026ank\nfor any number k of alphabet symbols.  Patterns of this type\nare recognized by Range Concatenation Grammars and Global Index\nGrammars; a comparison with these formalisms then might be useful to\nfix the upper bound of the recognizing capacity of LG, which is as yet\nunknown.\nWith respect to computational complexity, Moot (2008) establishes a\ncorrespondence between Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammars on the one\nhand, and categorial grammars with the multimodal extraction\npostulates of \u00a73.1 and a restricted set of LG grammars on\nthe other. For these grammars he obtains a polynomial parsability\nresult via a translation into Hyperedge Replacement Grammars.  In the\ncase of LG, the restriction requires the coimplications\n\u2298,\u29b8 to occur in matching pairs in lexical type\nassignments.  The lexicon of the generalized MIX construction of\nMelissen 2009, and the type assignment used for quantifier phrases in\nthe analysis of scope construal in Bernardi and Moortgat 2010, do not\nrespect this restriction. For the general case of LG with the\ninteraction principles of \u00a73.3, Bransen (2010) establishes\nNP-completeness.  The position of the discontinuous calculi of\n\u00a73.2 in this hierarchy has to be determined: they\nrecognize more than the context-free languages, but it is not clear\nwhether they stay within the mildly context-sensitive family.\n",
