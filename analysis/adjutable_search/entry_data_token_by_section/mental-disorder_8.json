    "main_text": "The Disorder in Mental Disorder || Suffering and Disability\n4.2 Suffering and Disability\n\nOther depictions of disorder rely on one or both of the groups of\ntraits around suffering, distress and psychic pain,\non the one hand, and, on the other hand, disability,\nincapacity and personal or behavioral dysfunction. These\nare the features noted in a series of influential prefatory remarks in\nthe diagnostic and statistical manuals (the DSMs and ICDs). The\nwording of the fifth edition of the DSM introduces a disjunction:\n\n\nMental disorders are usually associated with significant distress\nor disability in social, occupational, or other important\nactivities. (APA 2013 emphasis added)\n\n\nA very similar passage from the ICD-11 is comparably qualified:\n\n\n\u201cDisorder\u201d\u2026is\u2026a clinically recognizable set\nof symptoms or behavior associated in most cases with\ndistress and with interference with personal functions. (WHO\n2020, emphasis added)\n\n\nPsychodynamic or psychoanalytic presuppositions may posit underlying\ndistresses that are masked, or submerged within the psyche; and the\nelusive phenomenology of some conditions suggests the presence of\nnameless existential anxieties hidden from awareness (Ratcliffe 2008,\n2017). But such explanations aside, distress has been widely regarded\nas a ubiquitous feature of disorder. In symptom-focused accounts\nlaying stress on the consequences of the syndrome, distress\nbecomes prominent as a form of disabling dysfunction (Stein et. al.\n2010). Instead of separate criteria (and either singly or jointly\nsufficient for disorder, as in the respective DSM and ICD definitions\nabove), suffering and dysfunction are conjoined on a\n\u201cdistress-impairment\u201d analysis, where disorder status is\nassigned with (and defined as) distress that is \u201cunmanageable or\ndisabling\u201d (Bolton 2013). The plausibility of this analysis\nincreases with what have been called \u201cdistress related\nconditions\u201d, such as depression and anxiety, that are\n\u201cmore constitutive of the illness\u201d (Bolton 2012: 10; see\nalso\n \u00a74).\n\nTo accommodate exceptions that seem neither distressing nor disabling\n(such as manic states), mental disorder is sometimes characterized not\nby distress and dysfunction but by raised risk of such outcomes (Gert\n& Culver 2004). But risk of disorder is not disorder, and risk\nlanguage invites troubling ethical issues around over-diagnosis and\nfalse positives ((Schwartz 2008; Stein et al. 2010; Bolton 2013;\nBroome, Fugar-Poli, & Wuyts 2013; Radden 2018).\n\nLoosely understood, moreover, distresses such as these are an\ninescapable part of the human condition and normal responses to\nlife\u2019s vicissitudes. When and whether normal (and even\nappropriate) suffering reflects pathology has long been the source of\nphilosophical\u2014and societal\u2014disagreement (Wilkinson 2000;\nHorwitz & Wakefield 2007). In the discussions of \u201cnormal\nsadness\u201d that accompanied the revision of a fifth edition of the\nDSM, the grief exclusion that had (temporarily) exempted from\ndiagnosis the suffering around mourning and grief, was challenged, its\nproposed elimination charged with \u201cmedicalizing\u201d or\n\u201cpathologizing\u201d normal and appropriate human feelings\n(Zachar 2014; Wakefield 2012, 2020). The separation of normal from\npathological distress will be indicated by distress emanating from the\ndisorder itself, rather than from other contingencies. But presently,\ndistresses resulting from the stigma and discrimination that follow\ndiagnosis and treatment, as well as a host of other, frequently\nnegative, consequences in jarring and alarming disruptions to personal\nlives, selves, and relationships, prove difficult to disentangle\n(Tekin 2011).\n\nSome predict that biological markers will eventually allow us to\ndistinguish distress that is a symptom of depression, for example,\nfrom that which is a normal response to external contingencies\n(Horwitz & Wakefield 2007). Such biomarkers may be welcomed by\nthose decrying over-diagnosis, although an evaluative interpretation\nas to whether, and when, such biomarkers occur in healthy and\nunhealthy form will be required.\n\nSome argue that the subjective experience of distress and the extent\nof impairment of the person\u2019s day-to-day functioning are\nintrinsic properties of disorders like depression: conceptually,\ndisorder attributions are made on the basis of \u201cconsequences of\nthe syndrome as they manifest for the subject\u201d (Rashed &\nBingham 2014: 245). Psychological symptoms may constitute a\nmental disorder, even as it is caused by biological or social factors.\nIn the absence of known biomarkers, depression is attributed based on\npsychological symptoms alone; and were known biomarkers present\nwithout evidence of any psychological symptoms, our intuitions\nsuggest, disorder attribution would be withheld. These intuitions may\nshift with time, it is recognized, depending on how most people and\nmost psychiatrists now understand, define, diagnose, and\ntreat, depression. But today at least, disorder would be attributed on\nthe basis of the symptoms of depression with or without biomarkers.\n(See Cooper 2020).\n\nAnalyses characterizing felt distress as a property constitutive of\nsome given psychiatric condition (such as depression), are also\ncompatible with recent models focused on the causally interconnected\nstatistical networks making up symptom clusters. These clusters are\ndepicted as reinforced through feedback loops that serve to rope\ntogether assorted symptoms independent of any underlying, antecedent,\ncommon, cause. In the case of depression, a range of symptoms arise\nfrom diverse sources and, through their looping interactions, form,\nworsen, and maintain the disorder as a relatively stable entity and\nconceptual whole (Kendler, Zachar, & Craver 2011; Borsboom &\nCramer 2013; Borsboom 2017).\n\nSymptom-focused accounts may combine suffering with disability, as was\nnoted. But a conception in terms of what the affected person is\nprevented from doing, or unable to do as well as others, captured in\nthe ideas of disability, impairment, incapacity and personal or\nbehavioral dysfunction, offers an alternative characterization that\ncan acknowledge disorders without apparent personal suffering (notably\nmania, some personality disorders, and some addictions).\n\nDysfunction and disability have been allied, or treated as rough\nequivalents; but sometimes disability is placed in opposition to\ndysfunction. Instead of construed as internal to the person,\ndisabilities are often represented as conditional\nimpairments, dependent on context (including physical and social\narrangements). They impose limitations on the person\u2019s ability\nto perform everyday activities and participate as more typically-abled\npeople do and, on this view, call for appropriate accommodation\nanalogous to ramps for those using wheelchairs (Oliver 2004; Polvora\n2011). The analogies linking psychiatric with other disabilities may\nnot be complete, however, nor can accommodations be achieved as easily\nas installing ramps (see Amundson & Tresky 2007; Rashed 2019).\n\nLike disability, the deviance eliciting societal censure and\ncondemnation is also placed in contrast to dysfunction, although\nefforts to further characterize that contrast have thus far been\nincomplete (Aftab & Rashed 2021).\n",
