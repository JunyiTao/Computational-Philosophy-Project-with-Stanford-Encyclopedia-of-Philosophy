    "main_text": "Autonomy in Social and Political Philosophy || Autonomy and Political Liberalism\n3.5 Autonomy and Political Liberalism\n\nLiberalism is generally understood to arise historically out of the\nsocial contract tradition of political philosophy and hence rests on\nthe idea of popular sovereignty. The concept of autonomy, then,\nfigures centrally in at least one dominant strand in this tradition,\nthe strand the runs through the work of Kant. The major alternative\nversion of the liberal tradition sees popular sovereignty as basically\na collective expression of rational choice and that the principles of\nthe basic institutions of political power are merely instrumental in\nthe maximization of aggregate citizen welfare (or, as with Mill, a\nconstitutive element of welfare broadly considered). \n\nBut it is the Kantian brand of liberalism that places autonomy of\npersons at center stage. Rawls\u2019s Theory of Justice was\nseen as the contemporary manifestation of this Kantian approach to\njustice, where justice was conceived as those principles that would be\nchosen under conditions of unbiased rational decision-making (from\nbehind the veil of ignorance). The original position where such\nprinciples would be chosen was said by Rawls to mirror Kant\u2019s\nCategorical Imperative. That is, it is a device in which persons can\nchoose principles to impose upon themselves in a way which is\nindependent of contingencies of social position, race, sex, or\nconception of the good (Rawls 1971, 221\u201327). But as is well\nknown, the Kantian foundations of Rawls\u2019s theory of justice\nrendered it vulnerable to the charge that it was inapplicable to those\npopulations (all modern populations in fact) where deep moral\npluralism abounds. For under such conditions, no theory of justice\nwhich rests on a metaphysically grounded conception of the person\ncould claim full allegiance from members of a population whose deep\ndiversity causes them to disagree about metaphysics itself, as well as\nabout moral frameworks and conceptions of value related to it. For\nthis reason, Rawls developed a new (or further developed)\nunderstanding of the foundations of his version of liberalism, a\npolitical conception (Rawls 1993).\n\nUnder political liberalism, autonomy of persons is postulated, not as\na metaphysically grounded \u201cfact\u201d about moral personality\nor practical reason as such, but rather as one of several\n\u201cdevice[s] of representation\u201d under which diverse citizens\ncan focus on the methods of derivation (such as the original position)\nfor substantive principles of justice (Rawls 1999, 303\u201358).\nJustice is achieved only when an overlapping consensus among people\nmoved by deeply divergent but reasonable comprehensive moral views can\nbe attained, a consensus in which such citizens can affirm principles\nof justice from within those comprehensive views.\n\nPolitical Liberalism shifts the focus from a philosophical conception\nof justice, formulated abstractly and meant to apply universally, to a\npractical conception of legitimacy where consensus is reached without\npretension of deep metaphysical roots for the principles in question.\nMore than merely a \u201cmodus vivendi\u201d for the participating\nparties, justice must be affirmed in a way that finds a moral basis\nfor all participating citizens, albeit from different frameworks of\nvalue and moral obligation. The operation of public reason, then,\nserves as the means by which such a consensus might be established,\nand hence public discussion and democratic institutions must be seen\nas a constitutive part of the justification of principles of justice\nrather than merely a mechanism for the collective determination of the\nsocial good.\n\nBut the role of autonomy in the specification of this picture should\nnot be under- emphasized (or the controversies it invites ignored).\nFor such a consensus counts as legitimate only when achieved under\nconditions of free and authentic affirmation of shared principles.\nOnly if the citizens see themselves as fully able to reflectively\nendorse or reject such shared principles, and to do so competently and\nwith adequate information and range of options, can the overlapping\npolitical consensus step beyond the purely strategic dynamics of a\nmodus vivendi and ground legitimate institutions of political\npower.\n\nIndeed, the assumption that all those subject to political authority\nenjoy the developed capacity to reflectively accept their life path\nand the values inherent in it invokes a level of idealization that\nbelies the conditions of many victims of past and ongoing oppression.\nThis virtually ensures that such structural conditions of society as\nracial domination, profound inequality of power, and patterns of\nexclusion of groups from equal standing in social space will be\nassumed away as irrelevant to the question of legitimacy (Mills\n2005).\n\nTherefore, social conditions that hamper the equal enjoyment of\ncapacities to reflectively consider and (if necessary) reject\nprinciples of social justice, due, say, to extreme poverty,\ndisability, ongoing injustice and inequality, or the like, restrict\nthe establishment of just principles. Autonomy, then, insofar as that\nconcept picks out the free reflective choice operating in the\nestablishment of legitimacy, is basic to, and presupposed by, even\nsuch non-foundational (political) conceptions of justice.\n\nCritics of political liberalism arise from several quarters. However,\namong the objections to it that focus on autonomy are those that\nquestion whether a political conception of legitimacy that rests on\nshared values can be sustained without the validity of those values\nbeing seen as somehow objective or fundamental, a position that\nclashes with the purported pluralism of political liberalism.\nOtherwise, citizens with deeply conflicting worldviews could not be\nexpected to affirm the value of autonomy except as a mere modus\nvivendi (see, e.g., Wall 2009; cf. also Larmore 2008,\n146\u20136). A line of response to this worry that could be pursued\nwould be one that claimed that values that amount to autonomy (in some\nconceptualization of that idea) are already functional in the social\nstructures and cultural practices of otherwise defensible democratic\npractices (as well as some critical projects that emphasize oppression\nand domination, as we saw above). This point raises the issue, to\nwhich we now turn, of the connection between autonomy, political\nliberalism, and democracy.\n",
