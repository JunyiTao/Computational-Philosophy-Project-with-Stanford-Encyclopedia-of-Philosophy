    "main_text": "Other Revolution Claims and Examples || Some Alternative Conceptions of Scientific Revolution\n6.1 Some Alternative Conceptions of Scientific Revolution\n\nDo revolutions consist, according to Kuhn, of major new materials\n(experimental facts, theories, models, instruments, techniques)\nentering a scientific domain or, instead, of a major restructuring or\nrearrangement of materials, practices, and community affiliations\nalready present? Kuhn states that the relativity revolution might\nserve as\n\na prototype for revolutionary reorientation in the sciences. Just\nbecause it did not involve the introduction of additional objects or\nconcepts, the transition from Newtonian to Einsteinian mechanics\nillustrates with particular clarity the scientific revolution as a\ndisplacement of the conceptual network through which scientists view\nthe world. [1970, 102]\n\n\nThe reader may find this claim confusing, however, because in the\njust-preceding paragraphs Kuhn had emphasized the ontological and\nconceptual changes of precisely this revolution, e.g., the radical\nchange in the concept of mass. Einstein\u2019s masses are not\nNewtonian masses, he insisted. They are newly introduced entities;\nhence, we may infer, new content. Yet Kuhn surely does have a point\nworth saving, in that relativity theory still deals with most of the\nsame kinds of phenomena and problems as classical mechanics and\nemploys immediate successors to the classical concepts. But, if so,\nthen reorganization of familiar materials implies a disciplinary\ncontinuity through revolution that Kuhn minimized.\n\nThat reorganization dominates Kuhn\u2019s conception of revolutions\nis apparent throughout his work. As a young scholar he had an epiphany\nwhen Aristotle\u2019s seemingly radically false or unintelligible\nclaims suddenly came together for him as a coherent, comprehensive\nworldview. This experience became Kuhn\u2019s psychological model for\nrevolutionary transformation from one paradigm to its successor and\ninformed his later talk of Gestalt switches. But he also emphasized\nthat revolution involves social reorganization of the field\n(not merely the cognitive reorganization of an individual), from one\nform of scientific life to another, incompatible with it. By\nimplication, his structural or formal conception of revolution\nexcluded the alternative idea of revolution as extraordinary bursts in\nsubstantive content.\n\nIn Conceptual Revolutions, Paul Thagard (1992) retains\nsomething of Kuhn\u2019s idea of conceptual transformation and the\nmore specific idea of taxonomic transformation. He distinguishes two\nkinds of reclassification, in terms of the language of tree structures\nused in computer science: branch jumping and tree switching. Branch\njumping reclassifies or relocates something to another branch of the\nsame tree, e.g., reclassifying the whale as a mammal rather than a\nfish, the earth as a planet, or Brownian motion as a physical rather\nthan a biological phenomenon. New branches can appear and old branches\ncan be eliminated. Meanwhile, tree switching replaces an entire\nclassification tree by a different tree structure based on different\nprinciples of classification, as when Darwin replaced the static\nclassification tree of Linnaeus by one based on evolutionary genealogy\nand when Mendeleev replaced alternative classification systems of the\nchemical elements by his own table. Taking a computational approach to\nphilosophy of science, Thagard employs his computer program ECHO to\nreconstruct and evaluate several historical cases of alleged\nconceptual revolution and arrives at a tamer conception of\nrevolutionary breaks than Kuhn\u2019s.\n\nThe Cognitive Structure of Scientific Revolutions by Hanne\nAndersen, Peter Barker, and Xiang Chen (2006) also devotes a good deal\nof attention to cognition and categorization issues, in a defense of\nthe later Kuhn\u2019s approach. The work of cognitive psychologist\nLawrence Barsalou and of philosopher-historian Nancy Nersessian (the\nfounder of the \u201ccognitive historical\u201d approach to science)\nplays a significant role in their account. Nersessian herself (2003,\n2008) emphasizes model-based reasoning. These are no longer static\ncases or exemplars, for they possess an internal dynamic.\n\nHoward Margolis (1993) distinguishes two kinds of revolutions,\ndepending on which kinds of problems they solve. Those revolutions\nthat bridge gaps, he contends, differ from those that surmount or\npenetrate or somehow evade barriers. His focus is on barriers, a\nneglected topic even though it fits Kuhn\u2019s account of cognition\nwell. Margolis develops Kuhnian themes in terms of deeply ingrained\n\u201chabits of mind.\u201d While such habits are necessary for\nefficient scientific work within any specialty discipline, they\nconstitute barriers to alternative conceptions. More broadly, deeply\ningrained cultural habits of mind can close off opportunities that,\naccording to the perspective of later generations, were staring them\nin the face. Margolis is struck by the apparent fact that all the\nmaterials for Copernicus\u2019 new model of the solar system had been\navailable, in scattered form, for centuries. No new gap-crossing\ndevelopments were needed. He concludes that, rather than a gap to be\nbridged, the problem was a cognitive barrier that needed to be\nremoved, a barrier that blocked expert mathematical astronomers from\nbringing together, as mutually relevant, what turned out to be the\ncrucial premises, and then linking them in the tight way that\nCopernicus did. If Margolis\u2019 account of the Copernican\nRevolution is correct, it provides an example of revolution as\nholistic reorganization of available materials, hence the\nnon-piecemeal, noncumulative nature of revolutions. The developments\nthat lead to a barrier\u2019s removal can be minor and, as in the\ncase of Copernicus, even quite peripheral to the primary subject\nmatter that they ultimately help to transform. Here one thinks of a\nmodel popular with mystery writers, where an everyday observation\nleads to a sudden change in perspective.\n\nDavis Baird (2004) contends that there can be revolutions in practice\nthat are not conceptual revolutions. He emphasizes the knowledge\nembodied in skills and in instruments themselves. His central example\nis analytic chemistry.\n\nThere is little doubt that analytical chemistry has undergone a\nradical change. The practice of the analyst, who now deals with large,\nexpensive equipment, is different than it was in 1930. Modern\ninstrumental methods are by and large more sensitive and accurate,\nhave lower limits of detection, and require smaller samples; different\nkinds of analyses can be performed. Analytical chemistry is much less\na science of chemical separations and much more a science of\ndetermining and deploying the physical properties of substances.\n\u2026 The revolutionary phase of Thomas S. Kuhn\u2019s Structure\nof Scientific Revolutions starts with a crisis, a problem that the\nestablished methods of normal science cannot solve (Kuhn [1962] 1970;\n1996, ch. 5). There was no such crisis in analytical chemistry. While\none might imagine that analytical chemistry underwent a change of\nparadigm, there was no crisis that provoked this change. Pre-1930\nanalytical chemists did not bemoan the inability of their chemistry to\nsolve certain problems. Instead, new methods were developed that could\nsolve established \u201csolved\u201d problems, but solve them\nbetter: more efficiently, with smaller samples, greater sensitivity,\nand lower limits of detection. These changes in analytical chemistry\ndo not suffer from any kind of incommensurability: today, one can\neasily enough understand what analytical chemists were doing in\n1900\u2013although the idea that the analytical chemist is one who\ncan quantitatively manufacture pure chemicals is startling on first\nencounter. \u2026 The transformation in analytical chemistry passes\nall of Cohen\u2019s tests.\n\n\nRecently, Rogier De Langhe (2012, 2014a and b, 2017) has been\ndeveloping a broadly Kuhnian, two-process account of science from an\neconomics standpoint. Instead of doing a series of historical cases,\nDe Langhe and colleagues are developing algorithms to detect subtle\npatterns in the large citation databases now available. De Langue\nemploys economic arguments to illuminate such themes as the division\nof cognitive labor, models of scientific progress, and\nscientists\u2019 decisions about whether to specialize or to\ninnovate. \n",
