    "main_text": "Monism || Objections to Token Identity\n5.2 Objections to Token Identity\n\nThe token-identity thesis has been the subject of a number of\ninteresting criticisms. Many of them, however, are difficult to bring\nfully into contact with Davidson\u2019s own particular version of the\nthesis, primarily because Davidson\u2019s version is derived a\npriori from the other premises in his framework. So, for\ninstance, it has been argued that mental events do not bear the burden\nof the spatiotemporal precision of physical events that they would\nneed to if the former were genuinely identical to the latter (Hornsby\n1981; Leder 1985). For example, it would seem arbitrary to identify\nthe deduction of some conclusion from a chain of reasoning with some\nparticular neural event or set of neural events occurring at a\nspecific time and place in the brain\u2014especially given the\nmicro-precision of the neural framework. Compare attempting to provide\nphysical description for the action of paying back a debt\u2014how\ndoes one determine the spatial and temporal parameters with the\nprecision demanded by the language of physics? Distinguishing between\n\u201cthe\u201d physical event, as opposed to its causes and its\neffects, can seem daunting if not outright nonsensical (Leder 1985;\nsee also di Pinedo 2006). Further, it has been argued that the only\npossible empirical evidence for specific token-identity claims could\nbe type-identities between either those or other mental and physical\nproperties, because evidence needs to be drawn from variant cases in\norder to sort out merely coincident from identical events (Leder\n1985).\n\nSuch criticisms become difficult to evaluate given Davidson\u2019s\na priori procedure for establishing the token-identity\nthesis. He can respond that we already know, a priori, that\nany particular mental event must instantiate some physical property if\nit causally interacts with any mental or physical event, given the\ncause-law and anomalism principles. Questions about how this physical\nproperty, whatever it is, relates to properties currently invoked in\nneuroscience come later and are necessarily secondary to this monistic\nconclusion. And there is no guarantee (indeed, it is quite unlikely)\nthat neuroscientific properties currently in vogue are candidates for\nstrict-law properties. As we have just seen\n (5.1),\n Davidson eventually came to explicitly associate the physical\nproperties that cover mental events with broad descriptions covering\nlarge space-time regions. Further, it would confuse epistemology with\nmetaphysics to insist that, because we can only establish which\nphysical property some mental token event instantiates by leaning on\nsome type-correlations between other mental and physical properties,\ntoken-identity claims presuppose type-identity. How we discover the\nparticular physical properties is one thing; whether there can be\npsychophysical laws is quite another, and not settled by the method of\ndiscovery.\n\nWe also need to keep in mind that Davidson embraces the possibility of\nsubstantive mental-physical correlations (ceteris paribus\npsychophysical laws), which directly address these epistemological\nissues. More generally, Davidson\u2019s token-identity claim is that\nthe predicates that come to form the vocabulary of the as-yet unknown\nstrict-law science will be capable of being used to describe mental\nevents. While we cannot judge this claim by appealing to features of\ncurrent neuroscience, it also seems that it should be possible to\nadjudicate conceivability concerns. And, putting aside\nDavidson\u2019s later views, while we are not currently in the\nbusiness of assigning fine-grained spatiotemporal parameters to mental\nevents, it does not seem obvious that we couldn\u2019t come to accept\nsuch assignments on the basis of theoretical considerations without\nthereby committing ourselves to the existence of type-identities.\nHowever, Davidson\u2019s official position, early and late, has\nalways been that we do not need to be capable of making such\nassignments in order to assert token-identity\u2014there must simply\nbe such true assignments, and this is something we know on the basis\nof a purely a priori argument. (Davidson 1999b; for further\ndiscussion of this issue, see the supplement on\n Related Views\n (Bare Materialism); for a different criticism of token-identity, see\nthe supplement on\n Related Views\n (Other Positions). For a criticism based upon Davidson\u2019s own\ntreatment of causal explanation, see Horgan and Tye 1985. For\ndiscussion of the criticism that Davidson\u2019s monism is too weak\nto warrant the label \u2018materialism\u2019, see the supplement on\n Token-Identity and Minimal Materialism).\n5.3 Is Supervenience Consistent with Mental Anomalism?\n\nWe have seen that Davidson supplements his monism with a claim of\nsupervenience. There are many different conceptions of the\nsupervenience relation (see Kim 1993b), and Davidson ultimately came\nto identify his version with what is called \u201cweak\u201d\nsupervenience, in contrast to \u201cstrong\u201d and\n\u201cglobal\u201d supervenience. Briefly, the basic differences\nbetween these positions are as follows. Weak supervenience links\nspecific mental and physical properties within but not across possible\nworlds, while strong supervenience links those properties across\nworlds. Global supervenience links the class of mental properties as a\nwhole with the class of physical properties as a whole within but not\nacross worlds, but does not constrain relations between specific pairs\nof mental and physical properties. Weak supervenience comes down to\nthe view that mental properties depend upon those physical properties\nthey are correlated with within a particular possible world, but those\nvery same physical properties may, in another possible world,\ncorrelate with very different (or even no) mental properties. Weak\nsupervenience is thus stronger than global supervenience, in that it\nposits correlations between particular pairs of mental and physical\nproperties, but weaker than strong supervenience in that it recognizes\nthe possibility that these correlations can fail to obtain in other\npossible worlds. (It should be noted that Davidson never brought his\nviews on supervenience into contact with his later views, noted above,\nabout the broad nature of the physical properties that mental events\nmust instantiate according to Anomalous Monism. It is not at all clear\nwhether or how these views can be combined. In the following\ndiscussion of supervenience, this complication will be ignored, and it\nwill be assumed that the physical properties in question are not of\nthis broad nature, since this is how Davidson\u2019s own discussions\nof supervenience seem to proceed, and certainly what his critics\npresuppose.)\n\nThe puzzling aspect of Davidson\u2019s doctrine of supervenience\narises independently of fine points of the disagreement between the\ncompeting conceptions of supervenience sketched above. Whether the\ndependency is between particular mental and physical properties, or\nsets of the two, and whether or not the dependency holds only within\nor also across possible worlds, it appears that it entails that there\nwill exist strict laws on the basis of which mental events can be\npredicted and explained that were supposed to be ruled out by the\nanomalism principle. Davidson sometimes claims (Davidson 1995a, 266)\nthat supervenience is actually entailed by Anomalous Monism,\nin which case it would appear to follow that Anomalous Monism itself\nis an inconsistent theory\u2014entailing both that there cannot be\nany strict psychophysical laws (the anomalism principle) and that\nthere must be such laws (supervenience). But generally his position\nappears to be that Anomalous Monism is simply consistent with\nsupervenience (Davidson 1993, 7). If supervenience and Anomalous\nMonism are indeed inconsistent, and the former is rejected, the\nquestion of the plausibility of a materialist position with no\ndiscernible relation between mental and physical properties arises\n(see the supplement on\n Supervenience and the Explanatory Primacy of the Physical).\n (The caveat about the relation between Davidson\u2019s later views\nabout physical descriptions and supervenience noted at the end of\n 5.1.\n should be kept in mind here.)\n\nWhy does supervenience appear to generate strict laws? When Davidson\nfirst stated the supervenience claim, he articulated it in the\nfollowing terms: \u201cthere cannot be two events alike in all\nphysical respects but differing in some mental respects\u201d\n(Davidson 1970, 214)). This formulation appears to entail strict\npsychophysical laws of the form\n\u2018P1\u00a0\u2192\u00a0\nM1\u2019. Davidson later came to focus on the\ninversion of this formulation: \u201cif two events fail to share a\nmental property, they will fail to share at least one physical\nproperty\u201d (Davidson 1995a, 266). The advantage of this\nreformulation is that it brings out the fact that the requisite\nphysical differences need not be the same in each case of\nmental difference (see Davidson 1973a, 253\u20134). As Davidson says,\n\n\n\nalthough supervenience entails that any change in a mental property\np of a particular event e will be accompanied by a\nchange in the physical properties of e, it does not entail\nthat a change in p in other events will be accompanied by an\nidentical change in the physical properties of those other events.\nOnly the latter entailment would conflict with [Anomalous Monism].\n(Davidson 1993, 7)\n\n\nThere seem to be two problems here, however. First, the inverted\nreformulation actually entails the original thesis\u2014that if two\nevents share all physical properties they will share all mental\nproperties\u2014and so once again generates strict psychophysical\nlaws. Second, even if the accompanied physical changes can be\ndifferent, that simply generates more strict psychophysical\nlaws\u2014\u2018\nP1\u00a0\u2192\u00a0M1\u2019,\n\u2018P2\u00a0\u2192\u00a0M1\u2019,\nand so on. So it is hard to see why Davidson thinks that the second\nformulation is consistent with the anomalism principle.\n\nSome defenders of Davidson (Child 1992, 224; see also Davidson 1973,\n258) have responded to the apparent tension between supervenience and\nmental anomalism by emphasizing that the degree of detail that would\nhave to go into the formulation of such laws would make them useless\nfor prediction, since it is unlikely that the relevant initial\nconditions will repeat. But as we have seen\n (4.2.3),\n this seems to be true of any candidate for a strict law\u2014it must\ntake into account all possible interfering conditions, and doing so\nbecomes quite unwieldy for generating predictions. And in any case,\nsuch laws would still provide strict explanations of mental\nevents, contrary to Davidson\u2019s own formulation of mental\nanomalism. So the problem that supervenience \u2018laws\u2019 seem\nto pose for the anomalism principle remains.\n\nOther defenders of Davidson (see Macdonalds 1986) have responded to\nthis problem by arguing that the existence of strict supervenience\nlaws is compatible with mental anomalism so long as we are not\nactually able to state any such laws and thus be in a position to use\nthem to predict and explain actual mental events\u2014which is\ncertainly the case currently and likely for the foreseeable future.\nThis suggestion exploits a literal reading of Davidson\u2019s\nofficial statement of the anomalism principle, which denies the\npossibility of strict laws on the basis of which mental events can\nbe explained or predicted. But in doing so, it makes Anomalous\nMonism into a much weaker position, dependent on the cognitive\nlimitations of human beings. It in effect becomes a contingent\nepistemological position rather than the necessary metaphysical\ndoctrine it purports to be.\n\nDavidson in one place offers a very different suggestion in response\nto the problem. He claims that the supervenient relations between\nmental and physical predicates that he envisages are of a ceteris\nparibus nature. He accepts the requirement that any satisfactory\naccount of the relation between mental and physical properties must\npermit appeal to local correlations and dependencies between specific\nmental and physical properties (Davidson 1993, 9). But he blocks any\nentailment from this requirement to strict psychophysical laws,\nsuggesting that such \u2018correlations\u2019 and\n\u2018dependencies\u2019 are of a ceteris paribus form.\n\nSuch a ceteris paribus conception of supervenience has not\nbeen discussed in the extensive literature on the topic (its\npossibility is recognized and endorsed by Kim 1995, 136; however, see\nKim 1993, 24\u201325) and it is unclear whether it can deliver a\nsuitably strong notion of dependency to satisfy materialist\nintuitions. But it does seem to be an attractive way of reconciling\nsupervenience with mental anomalism so that Anomalous Monism remains a\nconsistent theory.\n",
