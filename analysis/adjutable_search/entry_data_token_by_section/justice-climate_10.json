    "main_text": "Responsibilities || The Political Action Question and First-Order and Second-Order Responsibilities\n5.3 The Political Action Question and First-Order and Second-Order Responsibilities\n\nAlthough much of the literature has focused on who should pay, there\nis another set of questions concerning responsibilities. To approach\nit, it is useful to distinguish between first-order and second-order\nresponsibilities, where a first-order responsibility in this context\nis a responsibility either (a) to mitigate climate change or\nfacilitate adaptation or (b) to bear the costs of mitigation or\nadaptation or both. A second-order responsibility, in this context, is\na responsibility to take action that ensures that others comply with\ntheir first-order (climate) responsibilities. (The distinction between\nfirst- and second-order responsibilities is made by Onora\nO\u2019Neill [2005: 428 & 433\u2013436] and is applied to the\ncase of climate change by Caney [2014a: 134\u2013147].) Second-order\nresponsibilities are responsibilities to change the social, economic\nand political environment so that agents comply with their first-order\nresponsibilities. They can include, for example,\ndisincentivising carbon-intensive options (through, say,\ncarbon taxes or quotas or mandatory regulations) thereby inducing\nagents to comply with a first-order responsibility to mitigate. Or\nthey can involve incentivising others to discharge their\nmitigation responsibilities by, for example, subsidising\nclean sources of energy or by designing the urban environment so that\npeople are more likely to walk or cycle or use public transport rather\nthan drive.\n\nA similar idea is advanced by Elizabeth Cripps who refers to what she\nterms \u201cpromotional duties\u201d (2013: 116 & chapter 6\n[esp. 140\u2013150]). These are \u201c[d]uties to attempt to bring\nabout the necessary collective action\u201d (2013: 116). What actions\nmight these involve? Cripps considers the promotional duties of\nindividuals and suggests that these involve campaigning, running for\nelection, signing petitions, sending letters to politicians, giving\nmoney to environmental organisations, and going on marches (2013:\n143). Walter Sinnott-Armstrong also suggests that citizens have a duty\nto campaign for their governments to implement climate legislation\n(2010: 344). One might also add to this list of second-order\nresponsibilities, duties to engage in civil disobedience and\nresistance against laws that result in unjustified emissions or\ninadequate levels of adaptation.\n\nTwo further points are worth noting. First, much of the focus has been\non what we might term \u201cpositive\u201d second-order\nresponsibilities. They are \u201cpositive\u201d because they require\nagents to take action. Given the arguments above, however, we also\nhave good reason to think that there are \u201cnegative\u201d\nsecond-order responsibilities as well. Whereas a positive second-order\nduty is a duty to take steps to ensure that others comply with their\nfirst-order responsibilities, a negative second-order duty would be a\nduty not to thwart or undermine initiatives to tackle climate change.\nThis is relevant given the argument that some organisations\u2014most\nnotably fossil fuel companies and electric utilities companies, as\nwell as some labour organisations\u2014have gone to considerable\nlengths to undermine attempts to combat climate change (Mildenberger\n2020; Oreskes & Conway 2010: chapter 6; Stokes 2020).\n\nSecond, the focus of many of those philosophers mentioned above has\nbeen on political institutions. While institutions are necessary they\nare likely to be insufficient. To arrive at a systematic and\ncomprehensive account of agents\u2019 second-order responsibilities\nit is worth starting with a political, social and economic analysis of\nwhy agents are not discharging responsibilities to mitigate and adapt.\nIf we start with this we can then work back from it and identify what\nneeds to be done by whom to bring about the necessary change. This is\nhighly likely to involve changing ideologies (for example, those that\nfoster fossil-fuel-driven growth), cultural practices, and social\nnorms, as well as institutions.\n",
