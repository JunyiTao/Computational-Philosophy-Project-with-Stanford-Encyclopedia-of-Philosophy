    "main_text": "Chance Without Randomness || Unrepresentative Outcome Sequences\n4.1 Unrepresentative Outcome Sequences\n\n\nIt is possible for a fair coin\u2014i.e., such that the chances of\nheads and tails are equal\u2014to be tossed infinitely many times, and\nto land heads on every toss. An infinite sequence of heads has, on the\nstandard probability calculus, zero chance of occurring. (Indeed, it\nhas zero chance even on most non-standard views of probability:\nWilliamson 2007.) Nevertheless if such a sequence of outcomes did\noccur, it would have happened by chance\u2014assuming, plausibly, that\nif each individual outcome happens by chance, the complex event\ncomposed by all of them also happens by chance. But in that case we\nwould have an outcome that happened by chance and yet the obvious\nsuitable sequence of outcomes is not KML-random. This kind of example\nexploits the fact that while random sequences are a measure one set of\npossible outcome sequences of any process, chancy or otherwise, measure\none does not mean every.\n\n\nThis counterexample can be resisted. For while it is possible that a\nfair coin lands only heads when tossed infinitely many times, it may\nnot be that this all heads outcome sequence is a suitable sequence. For\nif we consider the counterfactual involved in RCT\u2014what would\nhappen, if a fair coin were tossed infinitely many times\u2014we would\nsay: it would land heads about half the time. That is (on the standard,\nthough not uncontroversial, Lewis-Stalnaker semantics for\ncounterfactuals: Lewis 1973), though the all-heads outcome sequence is\npossible, it does not occur at any of the nearest possibilities in\nwhich a fair coin is tossed infinitely many times.\n\n\nIf we adopt a non-reductionist account of chance, this line of\nresistance is quite implausible. For there is nothing inconsistent on\nsuch views about a situation where the statistical properties of the\noccurrent sequence of outcomes and the chance diverge arbitrarily far,\nand it seems that such possibilities are just as close in relevant\nrespects as those where the occurrent outcome statistics reflect the\nchances. In particular, as the all-heads sequence has some chance of\ncoming to pass, there is (by BCP) a physical possibility sharing\nhistory and laws with our world in which all-heads occurs. This looks\nlike a legitimately close possibility to our own.\n\n\nProspects look rather better on a reductionist view of chance\n (Supplement\n A.3).\n On such a view, we\ncan say that worlds where an infinite sequence of heads does occur at\nsome close possibility will look very different from ours; they differ\nin law or history to ours. In such worlds, the chance of heads is much\ncloser to 1 (reflecting the fact that if a coin were tossed infinitely\nmany times, it might well land heads on each toss)\u2014the coin is\nnot after all fair. The response, then, is that in any situation where\nthe reductionist chance of heads really is 0.5, suitable outcome\nsequences in that situation or its nearest neighbours are in\nfact all unbiased with respect to outcome frequencies. That is\nto say, they at least satisfy the property of large numbers; and\narguably they can be expected to meet other randomness properties also.\nSo, on this view, there is no counterexample to RCT from the mere\npossibility of these kinds of extreme outcome sequences. This response\ndepends on the success of the reductionist similarity metrics for\nchancy counterfactuals developed by Lewis (1979a) and Williams (2008);\nthe latter construction, in particular, invokes a close connection\nbetween similarity and randomness. (Lewis\u2019 original construction is\ncriticised in Hawthorne 2005.)\n\n\nHowever, we needn\u2019t use such an extreme example to make the point.\nFor the same phenomenon exists with almost any unrepresentative outcome\nsequence. A fair coin, tossed 1000 times, has a positive chance of\nlanding heads more than 700 times. But any outcome sequence of 1000\ntosses which contains more than 700 heads will be compressible (long\nruns of heads are common enough to be exploited by an efficient coding\nalgorithm, and 1000 outcomes is long enough to swamp the constants\ninvolved in defining the universal prefix-free Kolmogorov complexity).\nSo any such outcome sequence will not be random, even though it quite\neasily could come about by chance. The only way to resist this\ncounterexample is to refuse to acknowledge that such a sequence of\noutcomes can be an appropriate sequence in RCT. This is implausible,\nfor such sequences can be actual, and can be sufficiently long to avoid\nthe analogue of the problem of the single case, certainly long enough\nfor the Kolmogorov definition of randomness to apply. The only reason\nto reject such sequences as suitable is to save RCT, but that is\nclearly question begging in this context. In this case of an\nunrepresentative finite sequence, even reductionism about chance\nneedn\u2019t help, because it might be that other considerations suffice to\nfix the chance, and so we can have a genuine fair chance but a biased\nand non-random outcome sequence.\n",
