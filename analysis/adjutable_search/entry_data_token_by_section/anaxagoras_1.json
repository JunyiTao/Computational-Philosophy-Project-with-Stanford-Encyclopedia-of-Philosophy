    "main_text": "Metaphysical Principles\n2. Metaphysical Principles\n\n\nAnaxagoras was influenced by two strains in early Greek\nthought. First, there is the tradition of inquiry into nature founded\nby the Milesians, and carried on by Xenophanes (Mourelatos 2008b) and\nby Heraclitus (Graham 2008).  The early Milesian\nscientist-philosophers (Thales, Anaximander, Anaximenes) sought to\nexplain the cosmos and all its phenomena, by appealing to regularities\nwithin the cosmic system itself, without reference to extra-natural\ncauses or to the personified gods associated with aspects of nature by\ntraditional Greek religion (Graham 2006, Gregory 2007 and 2013). They\nbased their explanations on the observed regular behavior of the\nmaterials that make up the cosmos (see White 2008 on the role of\nobservation and measurement in early Presocratic theories).\n\n\nSecond, there is the influence of Eleatic arguments, due to\nParmenides, concerning the metaphysical requirements for a basic\nexplanatory entity within this Milesian framework, and the\nmetaphysically proper way to go about inquiry (Curd, 2004, 2007; Sisko\n2003; for different views, see Palmer 2009, Sisko 2013).  Parmenides\ncan be seen as arguing that any acceptable cosmological account must\nbe rational, i.e., in conformity with the canons for proper inquiry,\nand must begin with metaphysically acceptable entities that are wholly\nand completely what they are; are not subject to generation,\ndestruction, or alteration; and are wholly knowable i.e., graspable by\nthought and understanding (Parmenides B2, B3, B7, B8; see Mourelatos\n2008a). Anaxagoras bases his account of the natural world on three\nprinciples of metaphysics, all of which can be seen as grounded in\nthese Eleatic requirements: No Becoming or Passing-Away, Everything is\nin Everything, and No Smallest or Largest.\n",
