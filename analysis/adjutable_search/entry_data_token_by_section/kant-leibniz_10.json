    "main_text": "Theology and Theodicy\n11. Ethics and Politics\n\nKant\u2019s ethics and political theory overlap with but also depart\nfrom Leibniz\u2019s. Leibniz argued that justice requires not only\nthat one forebear from harming others or giving them cause for\ncomplaint; justice also requires helping them by seeking their good\nand preventing evil when doing so is not too difficult. (Riley ed.\n53\u20135). He suggested a variety of social improvements and measures for\nthe remediation of poverty and anticipated the universalist\nformulations of Kant\u2019s maxim-test from the Groundwork.\n\u201cPut yourself in the place of another, and you will have the\ntrue point of view for judging what is just or not.\u201d Although it\nis \u2018impossible to act so that the whole world is content,\u2019\nthe affected ones can be made as content as possible (Riley ed. 56\u20137).\nKant\u2019s ethics by contrast does not make the enhancement of\nwelfare or the avoidance of harm criteria of moral goodness or\nrectitude, though some commentators would insist that his\nuniversalization test implicitly depends on such criteria. He\nacknowledges a traditional duty to benevolence but gives no\nsocio-political examples of welfare policies and shows himself\ndistinctly sceptical about what he considered exaggerated,\ntender-hearted utilitarianism (25:504\u20135). \n\nLeibniz considered some forms of slavery just, insofar as some humans\nwere similar to dumb, ineducable animals, and because slavery is\ncontingent and temporary because life is eternal (Riley, 78). Kant\ninsisted on a sharper animal-human divide, was not sure about\nimmortality, but he considered only the enslavement of criminals just\n(6: 332\u20133). American aboriginals and Africans are also described as\n\u2018fit only to be slaves\u2019 (XV:181). The inferior races would\ndie out or be exterminated ( (XV: 878). White, male, Christian\nEuropeans could, he hoped, in time bring civilization to the entire\nworld. Leibniz\u2019s early views were no more savoury;\n\u2018barbarians,\u2019 whom he considered \u2018beasts\u2019 (see\nPerkins, 111), could be destroyed in order to civilize them.\nLeibniz\u2019s racism reflects the snobbery of the courtier, which is\nat any rate courteous to women, while the Kantian tendency to\npathologize the other flowed rather from an excess of moral fervour\nand his vigorous antifeminism. True to his rejection of the Principle\nof Contradiction, Kant saw the human soul as the battleground of\nanimalistic instincts vs. moral duties. Self-indulgence, credulity,\nand indolence, which were unfortunately built into the character of\nwomen and nonEuropeans were to be combated by moral rectitude,\neducation and critique, and industry. \n\nYet the deprivations that had to be endured by a person of strong\nmoral fibre exercising a good will were, Kant recognized, real\ndeprivations. If the struggle for self-mastery and self-improvement\nthat he urged on his readers was not to seem, and indeed to be a\npointless exercise, then knowledge, as he expressed it in the Preface\nto the second edition of the Critique of Pure Reason, had to\nbe denied in order to make room for faith (B xxx). Alarmed by colonial\ndepredations, Kant nevertheless saw social and geopolitical conflict\nas necessary, at least until his second thoughts in his 1795 essay on\n\u2018Perpetual Peace\u2019. Like Leibniz, he tried to find\nredeeming aspects to group aggression and interracial conflict as\npreconditions of pacification, civilization, and progress. His own\nconcept of development, of the unfolding of latent potentials, is\ncentral to his anthropology and his philosophy of history. Development\nwas, however, as much of a duty as an inevitability. He accepted\nLeibniz\u2019s teleology of history: \u201cWe should be content with\nprovidence and with the course of human affairs as a whole, which does\nnot begin with good and then proceed to evil, but develops gradually\nfrom worse to better\u2026\u201d (8:123). In his 1795 work, he\narrived at the view that warfare was a scourge that would eliminate\nitself when exhausted and enlightened people would finally refuse to\nfinance the rivalries and glory of princes. Leibniz, too, even more\ndependent than Kant on the favour of rulers, seems to have abandoned\nhis earlier militarism in old age (see Wilson). \n\nFor Kant, philosophy is a stern discipline frequently calling for\ngraceless prose. After publishing several floridly written popular\nworks, and after acquiring his knowledge of physics through such\naccessible expositions as Bernard Fontenelle\u2019s Dialogues on\nthe Plurality of Worlds (1696), Emilie du Chatelet\u2019s\nInstitutions of Physics (1740), and Euler\u2019s Letters\nto a German Princess (1768\u201372) (7:229\u201330), Kant\ntraded literary charm for technicality, rigor, and repetition,\nespecially in the first two Critiques. The enchanting views\nof the Monadology which Leibniz himself may have regarded as\na jeu d\u2019esprit were antithetical to philosophy\u2019s true\npurpose. Yet Kant finally aestheticizes Leibniz, claiming that he\nmeant only to express a view of the world that is true in its own way.\nThe history of philosophy, Kant suggests, is not to be assessed in\nterms of right and wrong doctrines. To accuse Leibniz or Plato of\nerrors is to take them as authorities, as one takes Cicero as the\nstandard for Latin, and this is a confusion; for \u201cthere are no\nclassical authors in Philosophy\u201d (8: 218).\n",
