    "main_text": "Regulating Evolutionary Individuals\n9. The Evolution of Biological Individuality\n\nFinally, the evolution of biological individuality continues to be a\nlively topic (Okasha 2011; Calcott & Sterelny 2011; Bourrat 2015;\nClarke 2016b; O\u2019Malley & Powell 2016; Queller &\nStrassmann 2016; Herron 2017; Sterner 2017). The starting point here\nis the idea that the history of life is the history of the\nconstruction of more complicated biological individuals from simpler\nindividuals, with natural selection (operating at one or more levels)\nfacilitating the transitions between these individuals. Underlying\nthese ideas is the assumption that many or all biological individuals\nare hierarchically organized: earlier individuals provide the material\nbasis for later individuals. For example, prokaryotes, which are\nsingle-celled organisms without a nucleus, form the material basis for\nsingle-celled eukaryotes, which do have a nucleus; in turn,\nsingle-celled eukaryotes serve as the material basis for multicellular\neukaryotes.\n\nThe evolution of biological individuals from prokaryotes to\nsingle-celled eukaryotes around 2 billion years ago, and from those to\nmulticellular eukaryotes in the last 600\u2013800 million years, are\nestablished facts. In addition, there appear to be no counter-examples\nto this evolutionary trend. Yet speculation and controversy surround\nalmost everything else that has been said about these evolutionary\ntransitions. Consider three such issues on which there is a sort of\ndefault position in the literature that remains subject to ongoing\nphilosophical and empirical interrogation.\n\nFirst, it is common to view the evolution of individuality itself as\nthe evolution of complexity. There are, however, questions both about\nhow complexity itself should be measured or conceived and about what\nempirical evidence there is for viewing the complexity of individuals\nas increasing over evolutionary time (McShea 1991). Are the number of\ncell types that an individual has considered (Bonner 1988), the types\nof hierarchical organization it manifests (Maynard Smith 1988), or\nsome more taxa-specific criterion, such as the information required to\nspecify the diversity of limb-pair types (Cisne 1974)? Fossils\nconstitute a principal source for the criteria that have been proposed\nhere. Yet different kinds of organisms leave fossils with distinct\nkinds of features, and some kinds of organisms are more likely to\nleave fossils than are others.\n\nOne natural suggestion is that there may well be different kinds of\nhierarchies for the evolution of individuality, since kinds of\nindividuals can differ from one another in more than one way. Daniel\nMcShea (2001a, 2001b; McShea & Changizi 2003) has proposed a\nstructural hierarchy that is based on two components, the number of\nlevels of nestedness and the degree to which the highest individual in\nthe nesting is individuated or developed. McShea provides an\noverarching framework in which eukaryotic cells can be viewed as\nevolving from differentiated aggregations of prokaryotic cells that\nhave intermediate parts; multicellular eukaryotes as evolving from\ndifferentiated aggregations of single-celled eukaryotes; and colonial\neukaryotes as evolving from differentiated aggregations of\nmulticellular eukaryotes.\n\nBy contrast, Maynard Smith and Szathm\u00e1ry (1995) focus on\ndifferences in how genetic information is transmitted across\ngenerations, proposing eight major transitions in the history of life.\nThese start with the transition from replicating molecules to\ncompartmentalized populations of such molecules, and end with the\ntransition from primate societies to human societies. While Maynard\nSmith and Szathm\u00e1ry are interested in individuality and\ncomplexity, their eight transitions do not form a continuous,\nnon-overlapping hierarchy. Their discussion is focused primarily on\nexploring the processes governing each of the particular transitions\nthey propose in terms of changes in replicative control.\nO\u2019Malley and Powell (2016) have recently argued that not only\ndoes this perspective omit critical events\u2014such as the\nacquisition of mitochondria and plastids, in what those authors prefer\nto think of as turns rather than transitions in the evolution of\nliving things\u2014but also that what is needed is a \n\n\nsupplementary perspective that is less hierarchical, less focused on\nmulticellular events, less replication oriented, and in particular,\nmore metabolic. (O\u2019Malley and Powell 2016: 175)\n\n\nSecond, it is common to view the trend from prokaryotes to\nmulticellular eukaryotes as resulting from some type of directional\nbias, one that makes the trend a tendency supported by underlying\nmechanisms and constraints. Perhaps the tendency is underwritten by\nthermodynamic, energetic considerations, by facts about the generative\nentrenchment of developmental systems (Griffiths & Gray 2001), or\nby evolutionary advantages of increases in size (McShea 1998). But in\nsupposing that there is some type of directional bias, each of these\nhypotheses might be thought committed to the sort of Panglossianism\nabout adaptation that Gould and Lewontin (1979) are famous for\ncritiquing, or (more subtly) to a view of evolutionary change as\nprogressive or inevitable in some way. Gould has used his discussion\nof the Burgess Shale (Gould 1989) to challenge such views of\nevolution, arguing that the disparity of the fossils in that shale\nindicates that living things are significantly less different\nfrom one another than they once were. Gould argues that the range of\nbiological individuals now on the planet is largely the result of\nhighly contingent extinction events, and there should be wariness of\nimmediately assuming that observed trends or patterns are adaptive (or\nother) tendencies.\n\nThird, many authors have recognized that whatever trends or tendencies\nthere are in the evolution of individuals, there have also been\nchanges over evolutionary time in the social relations between\nindividuals (e.g., Frank 1998), and in the sorts of shared resources\nthat are available to the biological individuals that Douglas Erwin\nhas recently discussed while drawing on the economic concepts of\npublic goods and club goods (Erwin 2015, McInerney\n& Erwin 2017). Yet how sociality should be integrated into a view\nof the evolution of biological individuals remains under-theorized\n(for recent exceptions, see Birch 2017 and Okasha 2018). And however\nlimited fossil evidence for individual structures and ecological\nniches may be, such evidence for the kinds and extent of sociality is\nsignificantly more sparse. Much of the work to be done here seems\ndistinctly philosophical in that it concerns how sociality is\nconceptualized. Should one accept the simple aggregation of\nindividuals as a basic form of sociality? Does sociality essentially\ninvolve some form of cooperation, and if not, what is the relationship\nbetween \u201cprosocial\u201d sociality and antagonistic forms of\nsociality (e.g., competition or predation)? Although the\n\u201cevolution of sociality\u201d has been taken up by animal\nbiologists (especially by primatologists) and evolutionary\nanthropologists (where it is often viewed game-theoretically), this\nhas served to reinforce a view of sociality that seems somewhat\nnarrow, e.g., the view is not clearly applicable to structurally\nsimpler individuals. Perhaps the idea that sociality is not a\nrelatively recent addition to multicellular life needs to be taken\nseriously. Instead, sociality may be a more sweeping feature of many\nif not all biological individuals, with the evolution of individuality\nunderstood in tandem with the idea of changing, shared, public and\nclub goods. This would make for a more dynamic and cyclical view of\nthe history of life than has been assumed in past thinking about\nbiological individuals.\n",
