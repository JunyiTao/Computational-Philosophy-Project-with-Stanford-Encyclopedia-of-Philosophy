    "main_text": "An Experiential Meaning of Not-Two || Zen\u2019s No-Thought and No-Image\n6.1 Zen\u2019s No-Thought and No-Image\n\nUpon hearing the phrase \u201cno-thought and no-image,\u201d one may\nwonder if there could be such a thing. To properly respond to this\nquestion, Zen thinks it important to determine whether it is posed\nwith a practical concern or a theoretical concern in mind. The\ndifference allows a Zen master to determine the ground out of which\nthis question is raised, for example, to determine if the inquirer is\nanchored in the everyday standpoint or in a meditational standpoint.\nIn the case of the former, for instance, Zen would respond by saying\nthat as long as the inquirer poses this question from within the\neveryday standpoint with a theoretical interest, relying on either-or\nlogic, the inquirer cannot understand the meaning of \u201cno-thought\nand no-image,\u201d as intended by Zen. This is because to formulate\nthe question, \u201cIs there or is there not\nno-thought and no-image?\u201d linguistically drives the inquiry into\na contradiction, for one cannot predicate \u201cis\u201d on\n\u201cno-thought\u201d or \u201cno-image.\u201d Only insofar as\n\u201cno-thought\u201d or \u201cno-image\u201d is treated as an\nidea in a linguistic space without consideration for its referent, can\none ask if \u201cthere is\u201d or \u201cthere is not\u201d such a\nthing as \u201cno-thought.\u201d In response, Zen maintains that\nwhen \u201cthere is\u201d or \u201cthere is not\u201d is\ntopicalized in its tradition, it is not the same as \u201cthere\nis\u201d or \u201cthere is not\u201d as understood from within the\neveryday standpoint. Zen claims that neither \u201cno-thought\u201d\nnor \u201cno-image\u201d can be linguistically or logically\napprehended from this standpoint. \n\nWhy does Zen insist on this? Zen explains that both \u201cthere\nis\u201d and \u201cthere is not\u201d (or more generally\n\u201cbeing\u201d and \u201cnon-being\u201d) are intellectually\nframed from within the everyday standpoint by accepting the\noppositional ontology where the meaning of \u201cis\u201d\nis predicated on the meaning of \u201cis not,\u201d and vice versa.\nTherefore, Zen maintains that to understand \u201cno-thought\u201d\nor \u201cno-image\u201d we need an experiential dimension that goes\nbeyond the oppositional thinking of the everyday standpoint. \n",
