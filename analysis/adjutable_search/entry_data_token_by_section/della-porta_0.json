    "main_text": "Life and works\n1. Life and works\n\nBorn into a noble Neapolitan family in 1535, Porta published his\nMagiae naturalis libri IIII in 1558. The immediate success of this\nbook firmly established Porta\u2019s reputation as a learned magus\nand professor of secrets in the European world. The book saw sixteen\nLatin editions; six Italian, seven French and two Dutch versions\nappeared by 1588 alone (Balbiani 2001), although in 1583 the book\nended up on the Madrid Index of Prohibited Books due to Porta\u2019s\nnaturalistic approach to witchcraft (Ernst 1990). A second version in\n1589 was enlarged to twenty books. Due to severe difficulties with\necclesiastical censorship (the Roman Holy Office had begun legal\nproceedings against Porta in the early 1570s), he remained under\nlife-long surveillance by the inquisition (Valente 1999).\n\nPorta\u2019s many difficulties with the inquisition\u2014censors\ndisapproved of his works on divinatory arts such as physiognomonics,\nthe art of predicting character traits from the faces of\nhumans\u2014were compounded by the distrust of more orthodox\nintellectuals such as Jean Bodin (1529/30\u20131596), who would have\nloved to see Porta burn at the stake for naturalizing the\nWitches\u2019 Sabbath, because Porta\u2014like Girolamo Cardano\n(1501\u20131576)\u2014had divulged a recipe for the infamous\nwitch\u2019s unguent (Magia 1558: lib.2, ch. 26; Ernst 1990; Balbiani\n2001).\n\nEarly in his life, Porta apparently founded an academy of secrets\ndedicated to the study of natural phenomena. Its members could only be\nappointed if they had discovered a hitherto unknown segreto (Badaloni\n1959/60). The meetings seem to have been held in Porta\u2019s\nNeapolitan palace. This was by no means uncommon, for by the middle of\nthe sixteenth century there existed at least six such academies in\ntown (Eamon 2017). There also exists some intriguing archaeological\nevidence for special subterranean meeting rooms under Porta\u2019s\nvilla in Vico Equense, then a village just outside Naples (Balbiani\n2008). After 1558, Porta travelled widely, stopping in Apulia,\nCalabria, Lombardy, Venice, and Paris. In Spain he seems to have\nvisited the court of Philip II, a renowned patron of alchemy who\nsought miraculous medicines for himself and his family\u2019s\nailments.\n\nThe Magia Naturalis is, unsurprisingly, dedicated to this important\npatron. Porta presented Philip II with another book on ciphers (De\nfurtivis litterarum notis vulgo de ziferis libri IV 1563), followed by\nL\u2019arte del ricordare (1566), a treatise on the art of memory (a Latin\nversion appeared in 1602 under the title Ars reminsicendi). In 1579\nand during the following years, Porta was repeatedly invited to Rome\nby Cardinal Luigi D\u2019Este (1538\u20131586), ostensibly to pursue his\nresearch into the secrets of nature, but perhaps more importantly to\nenjoy some protection in his household during his trial before the\ninquisition (Perfetti 2001). 1580 found Porta overseeing the\nconstruction of a parabolic mirror in Venice, where he met Paolo Sarpi\n(1552\u20131623) (Reeves 2008).\n\nHaving sold parts of his Neapolitan palazzo in the preceding year,\nPorta returned to Naples in 1582 and began researching the\nphilosopher\u2019s stone at the behest of Cardinal D\u2019Este. In the\nfollowing two years he published two treaties on agriculture (Pomarium\n1583, Olivetum 1584) and his richly illustrated Humana physiognomia\n(1584). In 1586 Porta was probably again summoned before the\nNeapolitan Inquisition, perhaps together with Luigi Tansillo\n(1510\u20131568), an influential poet (and a close acquaintance of\nGiordano Bruno (1548\u20131600)). Porta was instructed to abstain\nfrom publishing on divinatory and magical arts and write comedies\ninstead.\n\nThat same year Porta returned to Rome under the protection of Cardinal\nD\u2019Este, who died a couple of years later. In 1588 and back in Naples,\nPorta published a physiognomony of plants (Phytognomonica) and a\ntranslation of the first book of Ptolemy\u2019s Almagest. The\nfollowing year saw the publication of the second, much enlarged\nedition of the Magia naturalis and the comedy Olimpia, which may have\nbeen staged in the presence of viceroy Don Juan de Zu\u00f1iga\n(1551\u20131608). In 1590, Porta met Tommaso Campanella\n(1568\u20131639); in the next year he published the tragicommedia\nPenelope, followed in 1592 by the comedy Fantesca as well as Villae, a\ntreatise on agriculture.\n\nThe Venetian Inquisition prohibited the publication of the Italian\nversion of the Human Physiognomony. The ban was reinforced in 1593,\nwhen De refractione, a treatise on optics, came out. In 1596\nTrappolaria\u2014another comedy\u2014was printed. Now famous across\nall Europe, in 1598 Porta dared to defy the inquisitional ban and\npublished Della fisionomia del\u2019huomo under the pseudonym\nGiovanni de Rosa. For the following three years Porta seems to have\nkept a deliberately low profile; his tragicomedies Fratelli rivali and\nCintia came out only in 1601. Porta then had the Latin version of his\ntreatise on the art of memory printed, as well as Penumaticorum libri\ntres (on the vacuum and how to lift up liquids) and Curvilinearum\nelementorum libri duo (on mathematics), two treatises that reappeared\nin enlarged versions as I tre libri spiritali (1606) and Elementorum\ncurvilineorum libri tres (1608). In 1603 Porta outlined a naturalized\nform of divinatory astrology and physiognomics in the Coelestis\nphysiognomonia. Federico Cesi (1585\u20131630), a young Roman\nnobleman with a passion for natural philosophy who founded the famous\nAcademia dei Lincei, visited Porta in 1604. Sorella was published in\nthe same year. Between 1606 and 1607 the comedies Astrologo, Turca,\nCarnbonaria and Moro were published. The short treatise De\ndistillationibus (1608) became another of Porta\u2019s bestsellers,\nbut this success was overshadowed by the death of Gianvincenzo Porta,\nhis brother and collaborator. De munitione, a treatise on military\nfortifications and on firearms, came out in 1608; in the following\nyear two comedies (Furiosa and Chiappinaria) were published. 1609 also\nmarked the beginning of Porta\u2019s dispute with Galileo Galilei\n(1564\u20131642) (another famous member of the Academy of the Lynx)\nover who had first invented the telescope. The Lincei reopened in\n1610, due to the death of Cesi\u2019s father, who had disapproved of\nFederico\u2019s scientific endeavours; Porta\u2019s discovery of the\ntelescope was acknowledged by the Academy, and he became director of\nits Naples branch (which, however, never opened, Freedberg 2002). Even\nso, Porta\u2019s role and influence on Cesi seems to have been\nconsiderable (Torrini 2018). The Holy Office prohibited the\npublication of Porta\u2019s treatise on palmistry, De ea naturalis\nphysiognomoniae parte quae ad manuum lineas spectat. In 1611 Porta\nopened the academy of the Otiosi, an institution dedicated to letters\nand to science; some of his plays may have been staged there. Porta\nseems to have worked simultaneously on the telescope and the\nphilosopher\u2019s stone. These endeavours resulted in the draft for\nhis last and largely unfinished work on (more or less) natural magic,\nthe Criptologia and the Thaumatologia, which was to be dedicated to\nRudolf II. This text testifies to Porta\u2019s systematic interest in\ndemonology and Neoplatonic magic (Maggi 2015). Needless to say, it was\nnever to obtain an imprimatur by the ecclesiastical authorities. The\ntragedy Gregorio (1611) was published, as well as the comedy\nTabernaria (1612) the following year; in 1613 Porta was honored by the\nLincei with a medal cast by Francesco Stelluti (1577\u20131653).\nAnother comedy, Fratelli simili, and the tragedy Ulisse were published\nin 1614. In February 1615 Porta died in the house of his daughter\nCinzia: there are no records of Porta\u2019s wife, whose name is\nunknown (for Porta\u2019s biography in general, see Clubb 1964, Romei\n1989; Piccari 2007, Eamon 2017, Verardi 2018).\n",
