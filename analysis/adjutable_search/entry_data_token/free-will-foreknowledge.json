Theological fatalism is the thesis that infallible\nforeknowledge of a human act makes the act necessary and hence unfree.\nIf there is a being who knows the entire future infallibly, then no\nhuman act is free.\n\nFatalism seems to be entailed by infallible foreknowledge by the\nfollowing informal line of reasoning:\n\nFor any future act you will perform, if some being infallibly believed\nin the past that the act would occur, there is nothing you can do now\nabout the fact that he believed what he believed since nobody has any\ncontrol over past events; nor can you make him mistaken in his belief,\ngiven that he is infallible. Therefore, there is nothing you can do\nnow about the fact that he believed in a way that cannot be mistaken\nthat you would do what you will do. But if so, you cannot do otherwise\nthan what he believed you would do. And if you cannot do otherwise,\nyou will not perform the act freely.\n\nThe same argument can be applied to any infallibly foreknown act of\nany human being. If there is a being who infallibly knows everything\nthat will happen in the future, no human being has any control over\nthe future.\n\nThis theological fatalist argument creates a dilemma for anyone who\nthinks it important to maintain both (1) there is a deity who\ninfallibly knows the entire future, and (2) human beings have free\nwill in the strong sense usually called libertarian. But it has also\nfascinated many who have not shared either of these commitments,\nbecause taking the argument\u2019s full measure requires rethinking\nsome of the most fundamental questions in philosophy, especially ones\nconcerning time, truth, and modality. Those philosophers who think\nthere is a way to consistently maintain both (1) and (2) are called\ncompatibilists about infallible foreknowledge and human free will.\nCompatibilists must either identify a false premise in the argument\nfor theological fatalism or show that the conclusion does not follow\nfrom the premises. Incompatibilists accept the incompatibility of\ninfallible foreknowledge and human free will and deny either\ninfallible foreknowledge or free will in the sense targeted by the\nargument.\n", "toc": [{"#ArguForTheoFata": "1.

The argument for theological fatalism\n\nThere is a long history of debate over the soundness of the argument\nfor theological fatalism, so its soundness must not be obvious. Nelson\nPike (1965) gets the credit for clearly and forcefully presenting the\ndilemma in a way that produced an enormous body of work by both\ncompatibilists and incompatibilists, leading to more careful\nformulations of the argument.\n\nA precise version of the argument can be formulated as follows: Choose\nsome proposition about a future act that you think you will do freely,\nif any act is free. Suppose, for example, that the telephone will ring\nat 9 am tomorrow and you will either answer it or you will not. So it\nis either true that you will answer the phone at 9 am tomorrow or it\nis true that you will not answer the phone at 9 am tomorrow. The Law\nof Excluded Middle rules out any other alternative. Let T\nabbreviate the proposition that you will answer the phone tomorrow\nmorning at 9, and let us suppose that T is true. (If\nnot-T is true instead, simply substitute not-T in\nthe argument below).\n\nLet \u201cnow-necessary\u201d designate temporal necessity, the type\nof necessity that the past is supposed to have just because it is\npast. This type of necessity plays a central role in the argument and\nwe\u2019ll have more to say about it in sections\n 2.4,\n2.5,\n2.7,\n and\n 5,\n but we can begin with the intuitive idea that there is a kind of\nnecessity that a proposition has now when the content of the\nproposition is about something that occurred in the past. To say that\nit is now-necessary that milk has been spilled is to say nobody can do\nanything now about the fact that the milk has been spilled.\n\nLet \u201cGod\u201d designate a being who has infallible beliefs\nabout the future, where to say that God believes p infallibly\nis to say that God believes p and it is not possible that God\nbelieves p and p is false. It is not important for\nthe logic of the argument that God is the being worshiped by any\nparticular religion, but the motive to maintain that there is a being\nwith infallible beliefs is usually a religious one.\n\nOne more preliminary point is in order. The dilemma of infallible\nforeknowledge and human free will does not rest on the particular\nassumption of foreknowledge and does not require an analysis\nof knowledge. Most contemporary accounts of knowledge are fallibilist,\nwhich means they do not require that a person believe in a way that\ncannot be mistaken in order to have knowledge. She has knowledge just\nin case what she believes is true and she satisfies the other\nconditions for knowledge, such as having sufficiently strong evidence.\nOrdinary knowledge does not require that the belief cannot be\nfalse. For example, if I believe on strong evidence that classes begin\nat my university on a certain date, and when the day arrives, classes\ndo begin, we would normally say I knew in advance that classes would\nbegin on that date. I had foreknowledge about the date classes begin.\nBut there is nothing problematic about that kind of foreknowledge\nbecause events could have proven me wrong even though as\nevents actually turned out, they didn\u2019t prove me wrong.\nOrdinary foreknowledge does not threaten to necessitate the future\nbecause it does not require that when I know p it is not\npossible that my belief is false. The key problem, then, is the\ninfallibility of the belief about the future, and this is a problem\nwhether or not the epistemic agent with an infallible belief satisfies\nthe other conditions required by some account of knowledge, such as\nsufficient evidence. As long as an agent has an infallible belief\nabout the future, the problem arises.\n\nUsing the example of the proposition T, the argument that\ninfallible foreknowledge of T entails that you do not answer\nthe telephone freely can be formulated as follows:\nBasic Argument for Theological Fatalism\n\n(1)\nYesterday God infallibly believed T. [Supposition of infallible\nforeknowledge]\n(2)\n If E occurred\nin the past, it is now-necessary that E occurred then.\n[Principle of the Necessity of the Past]\n (3) It is now-necessary\nthat yesterday God believed T. [1, 2]\n (4) Necessarily, if\nyesterday God believed T, then T. [Definition of\n\u201cinfallibility\u201d]\n (5) If p is\nnow-necessary, and necessarily (p \u2192 q), then\nq is now-necessary. [Transfer of Necessity Principle]\n (6) So it is now-necessary\nthat T. [3,4,5]\n (7) If it is now-necessary\nthat T, then you cannot do otherwise than answer the\ntelephone tomorrow at 9 am. [Definition of\n\u201cnecessary\u201d]\n (8) Therefore, you cannot\ndo otherwise than answer the telephone tomorrow at 9 am. [6, 7]\n (9) If you cannot do\notherwise when you do an act, you do not act freely. [Principle of\nAlternate Possibilities]\n(10) Therefore, when you\nanswer the telephone tomorrow at 9 am, you will not do it freely. [8,\n9]\n\n\nThis argument is formulated in a way that makes its logical form as\nperspicuous as possible, and there is a consensus that this argument\nor something close to it is valid. That is, if the premises are all\ntrue, the conclusion follows. The compatibilist about infallible\nforeknowledge and free will must therefore find a false premise. There\nare four premises that are not straightforward substitutions in\ndefinitions: (1), (2), (5), and (9). All four of these premises have\ncome under attack in the history of discussion of theological\nfatalism. Aristotle\u2019s concern about future contingent truth has\nmotivated an increasing number of compatibilists to challenge premise\n(1). Boethius and Aquinas also denied premise (1), but on the grounds\nthat God and his beliefs are not in time, a solution that has always\nhad some adherents. William of Ockham rejected premise (2), arguing\nthat the necessity of the past does not apply to the entire past, and\nGod\u2019s past beliefs are in the part of the past to which the\nnecessity of the past does not apply. This approach to the problem was\nrevived early in the debate stirred up by Pike\u2019s article, and\nhas probably attracted more attention, in its various incarnations,\nthan any other solution. There are more radical responses to (2) as\nwell. Premise (5) has rarely been disputed and is an analogue of an\naxiom of modal logic, but it may have been denied by Duns Scotus and\nLuis de Molina. Although doubts about premise (9) arose relatively\nlate in the debate, inspired by contemporary discussions of the\nrelation between free will and the ability to do otherwise, the denial\nof (9) is arguably the key to the solution proposed by Augustine. In\naddition to the foregoing compatibilist solutions, there are two\nincompatibilist responses to the problem of theological fatalism. One\nis to deny that God (or any being) has infallible foreknowledge. The\nother is to deny that human beings have free will in the libertarian\nsense of free will. These responses will be discussed in section\n 3.\n The relationship between theological fatalism and logical fatalism\nwill be discussed in section\n 4.\n In section\n 5\n we will consider whether the problem of theological fatalism is just\na theological version of a more general problem in metaphysics that\nisn\u2019t ultimately about God, or even about free will.\n2. Compatibilist responses to theological fatalism\n2.1 The denial of future contingent truth\n\nOne response to the dilemma of infallible foreknowledge and free will\nis to deny that the proposition T can be true, on the grounds\nthat no proposition about the contingent future is true: such\npropositions are either false (given Bivalence), or neither true nor\nfalse. This response rejects the terms in which the problem is set up.\nSince God wouldn\u2019t believe a proposition unless it were true,\npremise (1) is, on this account, a non-starter. The idea behind this\nresponse is usually that propositions about the contingent future\nbecome true when and only when the event occurs that the proposition\nis about. If the event does not occur at that time, then the\nproposition becomes false. This seems to have been the position of\nAristotle in the famous Sea Battle argument of De\nInterpretatione IX, where Aristotle is concerned with the\nimplications of the truth of a proposition about the future, not the\nproblem of infallible knowledge of the future. But some philosophers\nhave used Aristotle\u2019s move to solve the dilemma we are\naddressing here.\n\nThis approach to the problem had already been endorsed, three years\nbefore Pike\u2019s seminal article, by A.N. Prior (1962), but it\nreceived little initial attention. John Martin Fischer\u2019s first\nanthology of essays on the problem (1989) does not contain a single\npaper advocating this solution. It wasn\u2019t until the 1980s, when\nit was defended by Joseph Runzo (1981), Richard Purtill (1988), and\nJ.R. Lucas (1989), that it began to gain traction in the debate. More\nrecently, Alan Rhoda, Gregory Boyd, and Thomas Belt (2006) have argued\nfor the \u201cPeircean\u201d semantics favored by Prior (1967,\n113\u201336), on which the predictive use of the word\n\u2018will\u2019 carries maximal causal force and all future\ncontingents turn out false, while Dale Tuggy (2007) has defended the\nposition that future contingents are neither true nor false. A\ncritique of both Rhoda et al. and Tuggy may be found in Craig\nand Hunt (2013). Another supporter of the\nall-future-contingents-are-false solution to the problem of\ntheological fatalism is Patrick Todd (2016a), whose recent book (2021)\noffers a vigorous defense of this approach against various objections.\nMany (but not all) of those who reject future contingent truth base\ntheir position, at least in part, on presentism, according to which\nonly the present exists. Statements about the future, especially the\ncontingent future, would then arguably lack the grounding necessary\nfor truth. D.K. Johnson (2009) has taken up this solution to both\nlogical and theological fatalism, as has Dean Zimmerman (2008). A\nmeasure of how much the debate has shifted in this direction is that\nFischer\u2019s second anthology (Fischer and Todd 2015) contains an\nentire section on \u201cThe Logic of Future Contingents.\u201d The\nconnection between this solution and \u201copen theism\u201d will be\ndiscussed in section\n 3.\n\nWhile there is considerable prima facie appeal to the idea that\nstatements about the contingent future aren\u2019t yet true,\nand that they become true only when the future arrives, both\nthe semantic and the metaphysical justifications for this idea can be\nchallenged. A semantics that collapses truth into necessity and\nfalsehood into impossibility, at least for propositions about the\nfuture, may appear insufficiently attentive to people\u2019s actual\nuse of the predictive \u2018will\u2019, not to mention logically\nproblematic. The true futurist theory (\u201cthe thin red\nline\u201d), allowing for future contingent truth, is defended by\n\u00d8hrstr\u00f8m (2009) and by Malpass and Wawer (2012).\nPresentist opponents of future contingent truth, for their part, need\nto explain how there can be contingent truths about the past but not\nabout the future, given that, on presentism, the past is no more real\nthan the future. (This is not a problem on the growing block theory.)\nRhoda (2009) and Zimmerman (2010), for example, have independently\nsuggested that truths about the past could be grounded in God\u2019s\npresent beliefs about the past; but if this move is allowed, it would\nseem just as legitimate to assume God has present beliefs about the\nfuture and use this to ground truths about the contingent future. The\nsemantic and metaphysical issues surrounding future contingent truth\nare complex and highly contested, so it isn\u2019t possible to do\nmore than note them here.\n\nIt is not clear, however, that the denial of future contingent truth\nis sufficient to avoid the problem of theological fatalism. Hunt\n(2020) suggests that future contingents that fail to be true for\npresentist reasons alone might nevertheless qualify as\n\u201cquasi-true\u201d (Sider 1999, Markosian 2004), and argues that\nthe quasi-truth of God\u2019s beliefs about the future is enough to\ngenerate the problem. The following consideration tends in the same\ndirection. According to the definition of infallibility used in the\nbasic argument, if God is infallible in all his beliefs, then it is\nnot possible that God believes T and T is false. But\nthere is a natural extension of the definition of infallibility to\nallow for the case in which T lacks a truth value but will\nacquire one in the future: If God is infallible in all his beliefs,\nthen it is not possible that God believes T and T is\neither false or becomes false. If so, and if God believes T,\nwe get an argument for theological fatalism that parallels our basic\nargument. Premise (4) would need to be modified as follows:\n\n(4\u2032) Necessarily,\nif yesterday God believed T, then T will become\ntrue. \n\n\n(6) becomes:\n\n(6\u2032)\n It is now-necessary that T will become true. \n\n\nThe modifications in the rest of the argument are straightforward.\n\nIt is open to the defender of this solution to maintain that God has\nno beliefs about the contingent future because he does not infallibly\nknow how it will turn out, and this is compatible with God\u2019s\nbeing infallible in everything he does believe. It is also compatible\nwith God\u2019s omniscience if omniscience is the property of knowing\nthe truth value of every proposition that has a truth value. But\nclearly, this move restricts the range of God\u2019s knowledge, so it\nhas religious disadvantages in addition to its disadvantages in\nlogic.\n2.2 God\u2019s knowledge of future contingent truths\n\nIf T is true, there is still the question how God could come\nto believe T rather than not-T, and believe it\nwithout any possibility of error, given that T concerns the\ncontingent future. T is contingent only insofar as it is\nstill possible for you to refrain from answering the phone at 9\ntomorrow morning, though we\u2019re supposing for the sake of\nargument that you will answer the phone at 9. But then\nit\u2019s still possible for T to turn out false (though it\nwon\u2019t), and still possible for the belief that T to be\nincorrect (though it isn\u2019t). This is hard to square with the\nclaim in premise (1) that God\u2019s belief that T was\ninfallible.\n\nThis problem for infallible belief about a contingent future parallels\na problem for God\u2019s knowledge of a contingent future. Though the\nargument for theological fatalism rests only on divine belief rather\nthan knowledge (since the additional conditions for knowledge, beyond\ntrue belief, don\u2019t play any role in the argument), God\nnevertheless wouldn\u2019t believe without knowing. But it\u2019s\nunclear what could have been cognitively available to God yesterday,\nwhen your answering the phone at 9 am tomorrow was still future and\ncontingent, to raise his belief that T from a correct guess\nto genuine knowledge. Prior (1962) held this to be a further problem\nfor premise (1), beyond the nonexistence of future contingent truths.\nFor William Hasker (1989, 186\u201388), Richard Swinburne (2006,\n22\u201326), and Peter van Inwagen (2008), who maintain (contrary to\nPrior) that there are future contingent truths, the impossibility of\nforeknowing them is the problem with premise (1). This\n\u201climited foreknowledge\u201d view has been critiqued by Arbour\n(2013) and Todd (2014a), among others.\n\nDefenders of divine foreknowledge need something to say in response to\nskeptical questions about how such knowledge could be available to\nGod. One possible response is that it\u2019s a conceptual truth that\nGod is omniscient, and his knowledge, including his knowledge of\nfuture contingent truths, is simply innate (Craig 1987). Skeptics\nmight regard this response as closer to a non-response. But others\nhave offered detailed if speculative proposals. These include Ryan\nByerly (2014), whose book-length treatment of the issue grounds\nGod\u2019s infallible foreknowledge in a divine \u201cordering of\ntimes\u201d that is supposed to leave human free will intact.\n\nIt is relatively easy to see how God can know what is (contingently)\n\u201cgoing to\u201d happen if this refers to the present tendency\nof things. All it takes is exhaustive knowledge of the present. But\nwhat is \u201cgoing to\u201d happen can change, as the present\ntendency of things changes, and what God foreknows on this basis (his\nknowledge of what is going to happen) will change along with\nthis change in present tendencies. This \u201cmutable future\u201d\nposition, defended by Peter Geach, has been revived by Patrick Todd\n(2011, 2016b). On the \u201cGeachian\u201d view, God\u2019s beliefs\nabout the contingent future constitute genuine knowledge, because they\ntrack the changing truth about where the future is headed. What this\nview doesn\u2019t provide is the infallibility required by premise\n(1).\n\nFischer (2016, 31\u201345) tries to fill the gap with his\n\u201cboot-strapping\u201d account of divine foreknowledge. Even\nhuman beings are sometimes in a \u201cknowledge-conferring\nsituation,\u201d or KCS, with respect to the contingent future. Since\nGod would be aware of all the evidence and other knowledge-conferring\nfactors that human beings are aware of in such situations, God is in a\nposition to know (some) future contingents in the same way that human\nbeings can know them: by being in the appropriate KCS. But this\npresupposes a fallibilist theory of knowledge. What accounts for the\ninfallibility of God\u2019s beliefs? Fischer argues that God can\n\u201cbootstrap\u201d his way to certainty by combining his beliefs\nabout the contingent future with self-knowledge of his own\ninfallibility. Hunt (2017b) objects that the account is circular, and\nthat it couldn\u2019t support anything close to exhaustive\nforeknowledge, since most future contingent truths will lack\nKCS\u2019s at any given time. Fischer (2017, and forthcoming)\nelaborates and defends the view.\n\nThe most straightforward account of the matter, accommodating the\ninfallibility of God\u2019s beliefs, is that he simply\n\u201csees\u201d the future. If God is in time, this requires that\nhe be equipped with something like a \u201ctime telescope\u201d that\nallows him to view what is temporally distant. A hurdle faced by time\ntelescopes is that they probably involve retrocausation. If God is not\nin time, however, he wouldn\u2019t need a time telescope to view the\nfuture along with the present and past. This brings us to the next\nsolution.\n2.3 The eternity solution\n\nA third challenge to premise (1), independent of the first two, is\nthat it misrepresents God\u2019s relation to time. What is denied\naccording to this solution is not that God believes infallibly, and\nnot that God believes the content of proposition T, but that\nGod believed T yesterday. This solution probably\noriginated with the 6th century philosopher Boethius, who\nmaintained that God is not in time and has no temporal properties, so\nGod does not have beliefs at a time. It is therefore a mistake to say\nGod had beliefs yesterday, or has beliefs today, or will have beliefs\ntomorrow. It is also a mistake to say God had a belief on a certain\ndate, such as June 1, 2004. The way Boethius describes God\u2019s\ncognitive grasp of temporal reality, all temporal events are before\nthe mind of God at once. To say \u201cat once\u201d or\n\u201csimultaneously\u201d is to use a temporal metaphor, but\nBoethius is clear that it does not make sense to think of the whole of\ntemporal reality as being before God\u2019s mind in a single\ntemporal present. It is an atemporal present in which God has\na single complete grasp of all events in the entire span of time.\n\nAquinas adopted the Boethian solution as one of his ways out of\ntheological fatalism, using some of the same metaphors as Boethius.\nOne is the circle analogy, in which the way a timeless God is present\nto each and every moment of time is compared to the way in which the\ncenter of a circle is present to each and every point on its\ncircumference (SCG I, 66). In contemporary philosophy an\nimportant defense of the Boethian idea that God is timeless was given\nby Eleonore Stump and Norman Kretzmann (1981), who applied it\nexplicitly to the foreknowledge dilemma (1991). Recently it has been\ndefended by Katherin Rogers (2007a, 2007b), Kevin Timpe (2007),\nMichael Rota (2010), Joseph Diekemper (2013), and Ciro De Florio\n(2015).\n\nMost objections to the timelessness solution to the dilemma of\nforeknowledge and freedom focus on the idea of timelessness itself,\narguing either that it does not make sense or that it is incompatible\nwith other properties of God that are religiously more compelling,\nsuch as personhood (e.g., Pike 1970, 121\u2013129; Wolterstorff 1975;\nSwinburne 1977, 221). Zagzebski has argued (1991, chap. 2 and 2011)\nthat the timelessness move does not avoid the problem of theological\nfatalism since an argument structurally parallel to the basic argument\ncan be formulated for timeless knowledge. If God is not in time, the\nkey issue would not be the necessity of the past, but the necessity of\nthe timeless realm. So the first three steps of the argument would be\nreformulated as follows:\n\n(1t) God timelessly\nknows T.\n(2t) If E is\nin the timeless realm, then it is now-necessary that\nE.\n(3t) It is\nnow-necessary that T.\n\n\nPerhaps it is inappropriate to say that timeless events such as\nGod\u2019s timeless knowing are now-necessary, yet we have\nno more reason to think we can do anything about God\u2019s timeless\nknowing than about God\u2019s past knowing. The timeless realm is as\nmuch out of our reach as the past. So the point of (3t) is that we\ncannot now do anything about the fact that God timelessly knows\nT. The rest of the steps in the timeless dilemma argument are\nparallel to the basic argument. Step (5t) says that if there is\nnothing we can do about a timeless state, there is nothing we can do\nabout what such a state entails. It follows that we cannot do anything\nabout the future.\n\nThe Boethian solution does not solve the problem of theological\nfatalism by itself, but since the nature of the timeless realm is\nelusive, the intuition of the necessity of the timeless realm is\nprobably weaker than the intuition of the necessity of the past. The\nnecessity of the past is deeply embedded in our ordinary intuitions\nabout time; there are no ordinary intuitions about the realm of\ntimelessness. One possible way out of this problem is given by K.A.\nRogers, who argues (2007a, 2007b) that the eternal realm is like the\npresent rather than the past, and so it does not have the necessity we\nattribute to the past.\n\nIf God\u2019s timeless knowledge doesn\u2019t threaten free will,\nthere\u2019s still the question whether it can be confined to the\ntimeless realm; if not, it might still cause trouble for free will.\nVan Inwagen (2008) argues against the Boethian solution on the grounds\nthat a timeless deity could still bring about the existence in time of\na \u201cFreedom-denying Prophetic Object,\u201d for example, a stone\nslab on which are inscribed the words, \u201cPeter van Inwagen will\nanswer the phone at 9:00 am on May 27, 2034.\u201d An interesting\npuzzle for Christian defenders of the Boethian solution is the problem\nof whether the knowledge of Jesus Christ during his time on earth was\ninfallible. The problem here is that the incarnate Christ was in time\neven if God is timeless. A particular problem discussed by Timothy\nPawl (2014a, 2014b) is whether Christ had infallible foreknowledge of\nhis own future choices, and if so, whether his created will was free.\nPawl defends the compatibility of Christ\u2019s infallible\nforeknowledge and the freedom of his created will.\n2.4 God\u2019s forebeliefs as \u201csoft facts\u201d about the past\n\nThe next solution is due to the fourteenth century philosopher William\nof Ockham, and was revived in the contemporary literature by Marilyn\nAdams (1967). This solution rejects premise (2) of the basic argument\nin its full generality. Following Ockham, Adams argues that premise\n(2) applies only to the past strictly speaking, or the\n\u201chard\u201d past. A \u201csoft\u201d fact about the past is\none that is in part about the future. An example of a soft fact about\nthe past would be the fact that it was true yesterday that a certain\nevent would occur a year later, or the fact that you saw Paris for the\nlast time. Adams argues that God\u2019s existence in the past and\nGod\u2019s past beliefs about the future are not strictly past\nbecause they are facts that are in part about the future.\n\nAdams\u2019s argument was unsuccessful since, among other things, her\ncriterion for being a hard fact had the consequence that no fact is a\nhard fact (Fischer 1989, introduction), but it led to a series of\nattempts to bolster it by giving more refined definitions of a\n\u201chard fact\u201d and the type of necessity such facts are said\nto have\u2014what Ockham called \u201caccidental necessity\u201d\n(necessity per accidens). The resulting formulations became\nso refined and elaborate, in an effort to avoid possible\ncounterexamples, that they risked becoming detached from the simple\nintuition they were intended to capture. Recent discussions of the\nhard fact/soft fact distinction may be found in Todd (2013) and\nPendergraft and Coates (2014). Plantinga (1986) argued that a\nsuccessful Ockhamist response to theological fatalism needn\u2019t\nawait the definitive formulation of necessary and sufficient\nconditions for soft facthood, because paradigm examples of soft\nfacts--facts that are surely soft, if any facts are soft--are enough\nfor the job. It\u2019s clear that proposition T, for\nexample--that you will answer the phone tomorrow at 9 am--does not\nexpress a hard fact about the past. (It doesn\u2019t express a fact\nabout the past at all.) But if God is necessarily existent and\nessentially omniscient, this fact about what you will do tomorrow both\nentails, and is entailed by, God\u2019s yesterday believing\nT. Assuming that hard and soft facthood are closed under\nlogical equivalence, it follows that God\u2019s having believed\nT is not a hard fact about yesterday, a conclusion that\ndoesn\u2019t rely on any particular answer to the general question\nhow the hard fact/soft fact distinction is to be articulated.\nResponses to this defense of Ockhamism may be found in Brant (1997)\nand Hunt (2002).\n\nThere was considerable debate over Ockhamism in the eighties and\nnineties. Some of the defenses in this period appear in Freddoso\n(1983), Kvanvig (1986), Plantinga (1986), Wierenga (1989), and Craig\n(1990). Some of the criticisms appear in Fischer (1983, 1985a, 1991),\nHasker (1989), Widerker (1990), Zagzebski (1991), and Pike (1993). The\nOckhamist strategy, relying as it does on the distinction between\nfacts about the past that are really about the past and facts about\nthe past that are really (at least in part) about the future, is\nintertwined with work on the reality of the past and future. Finch and\nRea (2008) have argued that the Ockhamist solution requires the\nrejection of presentism.\n\nPerhaps the toughest obstacle confronting the Ockhamist solution is\nthat it is very difficult to give an account of the necessity of the\npast that preserves the intuition that the past has a special kind of\nnecessity in virtue of being past, but which has the consequence that\nGod\u2019s past beliefs do not have that kind of necessity. The\nproblem is that God\u2019s past beliefs seem to be as good a\ncandidate for something that is strictly past as almost anything we\ncan think of, such as an explosion that occurred last week. If\nGod\u2019s past beliefs about the future are soft facts, but the past\nexplosion is a hard fact, that must be because of something special\nabout God\u2019s past beliefs that is intuitively plausible apart\nfrom the attempt to avoid theological fatalism. Perhaps God\u2019s\ndoxastic states are best understood in terms of \u201cwide\ncontent\u201d or a functionalist account of the mental (Zemach and\nWiderker 1987); perhaps divine omniscience is dispositional rather\nthan occurrent (Hunt 1995), or doesn\u2019t involve beliefs at\nall (Alston 1986). If God\u2019s foreknowledge is special in any of\nthese ways, premise (2) is arguably false. But there are theological\ncosts to these conceptions of divine omniscience. The appeal to\nPutnam\u2019s point that \u201cmeanings ain\u2019t in the\nhead\u201d conflicts with the \u201cincompatibilist\nconstraint\u201d in Fischer (1983); see also Hasker (1988) for a\nresponse to Alston, and Hughes (1997) for a response to Hunt. Since\nthese accounts of divine foreknowledge aren\u2019t independently\nplausible, however interesting they might be theoretically, it is hard\nto avoid the conclusion that the Ockhamist solution is ad\nhoc.\n2.5 The dependence solution\n\nOne of the best-known Ockhamist proposals after Adams was made by\nAlvin Plantinga (1986), who defined the accidentally necessary in\nterms of lack of counterfactual power. For someone, Jones, to have\ncounterfactual power over God\u2019s past beliefs, the following must\nbe true:\n\n(CPP) It was within\nJones\u2019 power at t2 to do something such that\nif he did it, God would not have held the belief he in fact held at\nt1.\n\n\nPlantinga argued that counterfactual power over God\u2019s past\nbeliefs about human free choices is coherent and if it occurs, these\nbeliefs are not accidentally necessary; they do not have the kind of\nnecessity the past is alleged to have in premise (2) of the basic\nargument.\n\nNotice that counterfactual power over the past is not the same thing\nas changing the past. Under the assumption that there is only one time\nline, changing the past is incoherent since it amounts to there being\none past prior to t2 in which God has a certain\nbelief at t1, and then Jones does something to\nmake a different past. That requires two pasts prior to\nt2, and that presumably makes no sense. What (CPP)\naffirms instead is that there is only one actual past, but there would\nhave been a different past if Jones acted differently at\nt2. (CPP) also does not require the assumption\nthat what Jones does at t2 causes God to have the\nbelief he has at t1. There is much debate about\nthe way to analyze the causal relation, but it is generally thought\nthat causation does not reduce to a counterfactual dependency of an\neffect on its cause. The dependency of God\u2019s belief on\nJones\u2019 act need not be a causal dependency. (CPP) is therefore\nweaker than the claim that Jones\u2019 act at t2\ncauses God\u2019s belief at t1. A discussion of\nthe counterfactual dependence of God\u2019s past belief on human\nfuture acts is given in Zagzebski (1991, chap 4).\n\nThe idea that God\u2019s past beliefs depend upon our future free\nacts has been enlivened by Trenton Merricks (2009), who argues that\nthe idea appears in Molina (see section 2.6). There is some question\nhow distinct Merricks\u2019 approach is from classic Ockhamism:\nFischer and Todd (2011, 2013) argue that Merricks\u2019 solution is\nsimply a form of Ockhamism and suffers from the same defects, while\nMerricks (2011) replies that the dependency relation between\nGod\u2019s past beliefs and human acts is different from the one at\nwork in Ockham\u2019s approach. The idea, in any case, is that the\ndependence of God\u2019s foreknowledge of future contingents on the\nforeknown events themselves, including future exercises of human free\nwill, along with the independence of human actions from\nGod\u2019s foreknowledge of them, is the key to defending the\ncompatibility of divine foreknowledge and human freedom. This\n\u201cDependence Solution\u201d has gained sufficient currency that\nit deserves a section of its own, regardless of its relationship to\nthe original Ockhamist strategy.\n\nThe Ur-text for this approach is the following passage in\nOrigen of Alexandria\u2019s Commentary on the Epistle to the\nRomans:\n\nit will not be because God knows that an event will occur that it\nhappens; but, because something is going to take place it is known by\nGod before it happens.\n\n\nThe because-relationship in question is stronger than counterfactual\ndependence, because it can be absent even when counterfactual\ndependence is present, as in the case of divine foreknowledge. (Though\nyou won\u2019t answer the phone tomorrow at 9 am because God\nforeknew you would do so, your answering it at 9 tomorrow is\nnevertheless counterfactually dependent on God\u2019s foreknowledge:\nwere God to have believed yesterday that you won\u2019t answer the\nphone at 9 tomorrow, you wouldn\u2019t answer the phone at 9\ntomorrow, and were God to have believed that you will answer at 9, you\nwould answer at 9.) What\u2019s needed is the stronger relationship\nof explanatory dependence.\n\nFischer and Tognazzini (2014), in a response to Merricks (2009, 2011),\nMcCall (2011), and Westphal (2011), ask how the dependence point alone\nshows that the hard past isn\u2019t fixed. That would require that\nthe agent upon whose action the past depends really can act otherwise,\nand this is just asserted rather than argued. After all, this is the\nvery point at issue, so simply assuming it is to beg the question. Cyr\nand Law (forthcoming) defend the dialectical appropriateness of the\nassumption that doing and refraining are both open to the agent.\n\nTodd (2013) challenges the courage of dependence theorists\u2019\nconvictions with a scenario in which, instead of simply foreknowing\nthat you will perform a certain action tomorrow, God prepunished you\nfor it yesterday. The explanatory relations are the same in the two\ncases, but your undergoing that punishment yesterday is surely a fixed\nfact about the past, and your performing that action tomorrow is\nsurely unavoidable. We have no less reason to think that God\u2019s\nforeknowledge belongs to the fixed past and that foreknown actions are\nunavoidable. Swenson (2016) and Law (2020) dispute the moral Todd\ndraws from his prepunishment case, appealing to time travel scenarios\nin which some fact about the past depends on what might yet happen in\nthe future, where our intuitions are supposedly more open to the\npossibility that the past isn\u2019t entirely fixed.\n\nSwenson (2016) argues that what\u2019s fixed isn\u2019t the past\nin toto, but so much of the past as isn\u2019t dependent on\nthe future. Rather than modifying the principle of the fixity of the\npast, Law (2020) advocates junking it altogether and replacing it with\nthe principle of the fixity of the independent. Law (2021) continues\nthe case for replacing the fixity of the past with the fixity of the\nindependent by arguing that the former, insofar as the past\nis fixed, is derivative from the latter. In two recent\npapers, Ryan Wasserman stakes out positions that differ from most\nother defenders of the dependence solution. After reviewing modal,\ncounterfactual, metaphysical, and logical analyses of explanatory\ndependence, and taking in lessons from time travel cases, Wasserman\n(2021) concludes that causal dependence is the best model for\nunderstanding how God can foreknow what you will do because\nyou will do it, and in Wasserman (forthcoming) he argues that the\ndefense of libertarian freedom against theological fatalism is best\nserved by emphasizing the independence of future actions from\nGod\u2019s foreknowledge rather than the dependence of God\u2019s\nforeknowledge on the foreknown actions.\n\nThe dependence solution redirects attention from the temporal to the\nexplanatory order, in which divine foreknowledge depends on future\nevents while future events do not depend on divine foreknowledge. It\nthen proposes that what\u2019s relevant to assessing libertarian\nagency is the explanatory order--the temporal order is relevant only\ninsofar as it follows the explanatory order, and (when it does follow\nit) because it follows it. Thus a fact about the past, such\nas God\u2019s believing yesterday that T, is irrelevant to\nthe libertarian status of a future action if that fact does not\nexplain, and is instead explained by, that future action. This much is\nconsistent with the past\u2019s being fixed and necessary in just the\nway that premise (2) requires, and consistent with the solution\nwe\u2019ll look at in\n 2.8.\n What the dependence solution adds is that openness in the explanatory\norder overrides the necessity of the past: any facts about the past\nthat aren\u2019t yet explanatorily fixed, aren\u2019t yet temporally\nfixed either. So (2) isn\u2019t true in its full generality, and\ndivine foreknowledge is one of the exceptions, blocking the inference\nto (3).\n\nWhether this additional move is plausible depends on the strength of\none\u2019s intuitions about the necessity of the past. If the police\nare already on the way, summoned by the tachyonic alarm system the\nbank teller is about to activate, not everyone will share the\nintuition that the teller still has the option not to press the alarm\nbutton.\n2.6 The transfer of necessity\n\nThe next premise in the argument is (5), the principle that licenses\nthe \u201ctransfer\u201d of necessity from (3) to (6) via (4).\nOckhamists and Dependence Theorists both allow that the necessity of\nthe past, when applicable to past events, transfers to the future.\nWhether this transfer principle is valid depends on the modality being\ntransferred and the modality effecting the transfer. Logical\nnecessity, for example, is validly transferred by entailment:\n\u25a1p, \u25a1(p \u2283 q), \u2234\n\u25a1q. But some modalities, like non-accidentality (Slote\n1982), are not closed under entailment. How about the necessity of the\npast? A much-discussed transfer principle, playing the same role in\nPeter van Inwagen\u2019s Consequence Argument that (5) plays in the\nargument for theological fatalism, is rule \u03b2 (van Inwagen 1983).\nThe necessity-operator featured in this principle is\nN, where Np is to be read,\n\u201cp, and no one has, or ever had, any choice about\nwhether p.\u201d Rule \u03b2 states that, given\nNp and N(p \u2283\nq), it follows that Nq.\nCounterexamples to rule \u03b2 were soon discovered, e.g., by McKay\nand Johnson (1996). But it was easy to amend the Consequence Argument\nto rest on Np, \u25a1(p \u2283\nq), \u2234 Nq, and this principle\nappears to have no counterexample. The parallel principle for\ntheological fatalism is \u25a1tp,\n\u25a1(p \u2283 q), \u2234\n\u25a1tq, where \u25a1tp is\nto be read, \u201cp is fixed, accidentally necessary, no longer\navoidable, etc., relative to time t.\u201d This principle,\ntoo, seems to have no counterexample.\n\nDuns Scotus (Kenny 1979, 56\u201358) appears to have challenged this\nprinciple. Fischer (1985b) responds to the challenge. But the theory\nof divine omniscience that has been most closely associated with the\ndenial of (5) is the doctrine of Middle Knowledge. This doctrine was\nvehemently debated in the 16th century, with the version of\nLuis de Molina, referred to as \u201cMolinism,\u201d getting the\nmost attention in the contemporary literature. Recently the doctrine\nhas received strong support by Thomas Flint (1998) and Eef Dekker\n(2000). Unlike the other compatibilist solutions we are considering,\nwhich aim only at showing that infallible foreknowledge and human\nfreedom are compatible, Molinism provides an account of how\nGod knows the contingent future, along with a strong doctrine of\ndivine providence. Middle knowledge is called \u201cmiddle\u201d\nbecause it is said to stand between God\u2019s knowledge of necessary\ntruths and his knowledge of his own creative will. The objects of\nMiddle Knowledge are so-called counterfactuals of freedom:\n\nIf person S were in circumstances C, S\nwould freely do X.\n\nMiddle knowledge requires that there are true counterfactuals of this\nform corresponding to every possible free creature and every possible\ncircumstance in which that creature can act freely. These propositions\nare intended to be contingent (a claim that has been disputed by some\nobjectors), but they are prior to God\u2019s creative will. God uses\nthem in deciding what to create. By combining his Middle Knowledge\nwith what he decides to create, God knows the entire history of the\nworld.\n\nThere are a number of objections to Middle Knowledge in the\ncontemporary literature. Robert Adams (1991) argues that Molinism is\ncommitted to the position that the truth of a counterfactual of\nfreedom is explanatorily prior to God\u2019s decision to create us.\nBut the truth of a counterfactual to the effect that if I were in\ncircumstance C I would do A is strictly inconsistent\nwith my refraining from A in C, and so my refraining\nfrom A in C is precluded by something prior in the\norder of explanation to my act in C. This is inconsistent\nwith my acting freely in C. Climenhaga and Rubio\n(forthcoming) clarify the nature of explanatory priority and in so\ndoing affirm the essential correctness of Adams\u2019 analysis. There\nare a number of other objections to Middle Knowledge in the\nliterature, as well as replies by its defenders. William Hasker (1989,\n1995, 1997, 2000) has offered a series of objections and replies to\nWilliam Craig, who defends Middle Knowledge (1994, 1998). Yet other\nobjections have been proposed by Walls (1990) and Gaskin (1993).\nRecent critical discussions of Molinism appear in Fischer (2008),\nGuleserian (2008), and Fales (2010). Defenses of Molinism appear in\nBr\u00fcntrup & Schneider (2011) and Kosciuk (2010), and a\ncritique in Shieber (2009). Perszyk (2011) is a collection of essays\nexamining Molinism and its future direction, while Perszyk (2013)\nprovides a survey of the recent literature.\n\nLet us assume, for the sake of argument, that the doctrine of Middle\nKnowledge is defensible. How does that avoid the conclusion of the\nargument for theological fatalism? Middle Knowledge does not entail\nthe falsehood of any premise of the basic argument. Freddoso (1988,\n53\u201360) argues that Molina rejects the closure of accidental\nnecessity under entailment, but for reasons closer to those inspiring\nthe Dependence Solution (though Molina does not dispute the necessity\nof the past). Flint (1998) rejects some of the steps of the fatalist\nargument in addition to defending Middle Knowledge, and more recently\nblends of Ockhamism and Molinism have been defended (Kosciuk 2010),\nwhich suggests that even though the theory of Middle Knowledge is a\npowerful theory of divine knowledge and providence, it is neither\nnecessary nor sufficient to avoid theological fatalism by itself.\n2.7 The necessity and the causal closure of the past\n\nDoubts about premises (2) and (5) can be combined into a more radical\ncritique of the argument. We have already discussed the Ockhamist\nresponse, which accepts (2) as applied to what is strictly past, but\nrejects it as applied to that part of the past that is not wholly or\nstrictly past. It is worth asking, however, whether there is any such\nthing as the necessity of the past at all. What do we mean when we say\nthat the past, the strict past, is necessary? When people\nsay, \u201cThere is no use crying over spilled milk,\u201d they\npresumably mean that there is nothing anybody can do now about the\nspilled milk; the spilling of the milk is outside the realm of our\ncausal control. But it is not at all clear that pastness per\nse puts something outside the realm of our causal control.\nRather, it is pastness in conjunction with the metaphysical law that\ncauses must precede their effects. If we decided that effects can\nprecede their causes, it\u2019s quite possible that we would no\nlonger speak of the necessity of the past.\n\nSo the necessity of the past may simply be the principle that past\nevents are outside the class of causable events. There is a temporal\nasymmetry in causability because everything causable is in the future.\nBut some of the future is non-causable as well. Whether or not\ndeterminism is true, there are some events in the future that are\ncausally necessary. If a future event E is necessary, it is\ncausable, and not E is not causable. But if the necessity of\nthe past is the non-causability of the past, it would be odd to pick\nout the class of propositions about the past as possessing an\nallegedly distinct kind of necessity since some of the future has that\nsame kind of necessity.\n\nThis leads to a deeper problem in the idea of the necessity of the\npast. Zagzebski (2014) argues that the interpretation of the necessity\nof the past as a purely temporal modality is confused. What people\ngenerally mean by the necessity of the past is that the past is\ncausally closed, meaning the past is neither causable nor preventable.\nUnderstood that way, the necessity of the past is not a purely\ntemporal modality, and it is not a form of necessity. The categories\nof causability and non-causability do not correspond to the standard\nmodal categories of the necessary, possible, and impossible. The\nattempt to assimilate the causal categories to modal categories is a\nmistake.\n\nLet us see what happens to the argument for theological fatalism if\nthe necessity of the past is understood as the causal closure of the\npast.\n\nLet us begin with a definition of causal closure:\n\nE is causally closed =df There is nothing now that\ncan cause E, and there is nothing now that can cause not\nE.\n\nTo use this principle in an argument for fatalism, the principle of\nthe necessity of the past will need to be replaced with the following\nprinciple:\n\nPrinciple of the Causal Closure of the Past:\n\nIf E is an event in the past, E is causally\nclosed.\n\nWe will then need to replace the transfer of necessity principle by\nthe following:\n\nTransfer of Causal Closure Principle:\n\nIf E occurs and is causally closed, and necessarily (if\nE occurs then F occurs), then F is causally\nclosed.\n\nTo recast the argument for theological fatalism, let us again consider\nthe proposition that you will answer the telephone tomorrow at 9am and\ncall it T:\n\n(1) Yesterday God\ninfallibly believed T. [Supposition of infallible\nforeknowledge]\n(2) If E is an\nevent in the past, E is causally closed (Principle of the\ncausal closure of the past). \n(3) God\u2019s\nbelieving T yesterday is now causally closed. [1, 2]\n\n(4) Necessarily, if\nyesterday God believed S will answer the telephone tomorrow\nat 9am, then S will answer the telephone tomorrow at 9am.\n[Definition of infallibility]\n(5) If E\noccurs and is causally closed, and necessarily (if E occurs\nthen F occurs), then F is causally closed. [Transfer\nof causal closure principle]\n(6) S\u2019s\nact of answering the telephone tomorrow at 9am is now causally closed.\nThere is nothing now that can cause S to answer the telephone\ntomorrow and there is nothing now that can cause S not to\nanswer the telephone tomorrow. [1, 4, 5]\n\n\nBut (6) denies that there are causes of the future. Certainly we\nbelieve that something now, whether agents or events, can cause future\nevents, and the fatalist does not deny that. What the fatalist denies\nis that we can cause something other than what we cause. So\nthe relevant half of the principle of the causal closure of the past\nis as follows:\n\nPrinciple of the Unpreventability of the Past:\n\nIf E is an event in the past, nothing now can cause not\nE.\n\nTo use this principle in a fatalist argument, we need the\nfollowing:\n\nTransfer of Unpreventability Principle:\n\nIf E occurs and it is not now causable that E does\nnot occur, and necessarily (if E occurs, then F\noccurs), then it is not now causable that F does not\noccur.\n\nThis principle is virtually identical to the transfer of\nunpreventability principle proposed by Hugh Rice (2005), and is\nsimilar to a strengthened form of the well-known principle Beta first\nproposed by Peter van Inwagen (1983).\n\nUsing this principle, we get the following argument for theological\nfatalism:\n\n(1) Suppose that\nyesterday God infallibly believed T. \n\n\nFrom the Principle of the unpreventability of the past we get:\n\n(2) There is nothing\nnow that can cause God not to have believed T\nyesterday.\n\n\nFrom the definition of divine infallibility we get:\n\n(3) Necessarily, if God\nbelieved yesterday that S will answer the telephone at 9am tomorrow,\nthen S will answer the telephone at 9am tomorrow.\n\n\nFrom 2, 3, and the transfer of unpreventability principle we get:\n\n(4) There is nothing\nnow that can cause S not to answer the telephone at 9am\ntomorrow.\n\n\nFrom a variation of the Principle of Alternate Possibilities, we\nget:\n\n(5) If nothing can\ncause S not to answer the telephone at 9am tomorrow, then\nS does not answer the telephone freely. \n\n\nFrom (4) and (5), we get:\n\n(6) S does not\nanswer the telephone freely.\n\n\nThis argument for theological fatalism is better than the standard\nargument if a purely temporal necessity is problematic. The second\npremise of the above argument is only the principle that the past is\nunpreventable, not a questionable premise that the past has a special\nkind of necessity distinct from the causal structure of the universe\nsimply in virtue of being past. But since the unpreventability of the\npast is not a form of necessity in the formal sense, then the transfer\nprinciple licensing the crucial inference to (4) is not a transfer of\nnecessity. Unlike the transfer of temporal necessity principle in our\noriginal argument, it is not a variation of an axiom of logic, and is\nfar from indisputable. This suggests that the idea of the necessity of\nthe past may be confused. On the one hand, we have inherited from\nOckham the idea that the past has a kind of necessity for which we can\nformulate an analogue of the formal principles of logical necessity.\nBut the intuitions supporting such a form of necessity are largely\nintuitions about causability, and the modalities of\ncausability/non-causability do not parallel necessity, possibility,\nand impossibility. If this is correct, then if there is a true\ntransfer of causability or non-causability principle, it is not\nbecause it is like logical necessity in its formal structure. The\nproblem, then, is that the fatalist argument needs a kind of necessity\nthat the past has and which is also transferred to the future via a\nvalid transfer of necessity principle. In section\n 5\n we will look at how this is a general problem that extends beyond the\nissue of fatalism.\n2.8 The rejection of the Principle of Alternate Possibilities (PAP)\n\nCompatibilists who hold that it\u2019s possible for an agent to do\notherwise, in the sense required for free will, even if her action is\ncausally determined, will probably be untroubled by an argument\npurporting to show that no one can do otherwise, given divine\nforeknowledge. The relevant interlocutors for the argument for\ntheological fatalism are those who endorse a libertarian conception of\nfree will (Alston 1985).\n\nWith that in mind, let us now look at premise (9). This is a form of\nthe Principle of Alternate Possibilities (PAP), a principle that has\nbecome well-known in the literature on free will ever since it was\nattacked by Harry Frankfurt (1969) in some interesting thought\nexperiments. The point of Frankfurt\u2019s paper was to drive a wedge\nbetween responsibility and alternate possibilities, and to thereby\ndrive a wedge between responsibility and libertarian freedom. In\ngeneral, those defending libertarian freedom also defend PAP, and\nthose attacking PAP, like Frankfurt, defend determinism, but some\nphilosophers have argued that PAP is false even if we have libertarian\nfree will. The literature that clearly distinguishes the claim that\nfree will requires alternate possibilities from the claim that free\nwill requires the falsehood of determinism is contemporary. The former\nis a thesis about events in counterfactual circumstances, whereas the\nlatter is a thesis about the locus of causal control in the actual\ncircumstances. Aside from the foreknowledge literature, support for\nthe rejection of PAP from the perspective of an incompatibilist about\nfree will and determinism can be found in Stump (1990, 1996), Hunt\n(1999b), Zagzebski (1991, 2000), Pereboom (2000), and Shabo (2010).\nThis view was originally called hyper-incompatibilism by John Martin\nFischer, but has recently been called source incompatibilism. For a\nrecent critique of this version of incompatibilism for solving the\nforeknowledge problem, see Werther (2005) and Talsma (2013).\n\nHere is an example of a typical Frankfurt case intended to show that\nan agent can act freely even when she lacks alternate\npossibilities:\n\nBlack, an evil neurosurgeon, wishes to see Smith dead but is\nunwilling to do the deed himself. Knowing that Mary Jones also\ndespises Smith and will have a single good opportunity to kill him,\nBlack inserts a mechanism into Jones\u2019s brain that enables Black\nto monitor and to control Jones\u2019s neurological activity. If the\nactivity in Jones\u2019s brain suggests that she is on the verge of\ndeciding not to kill Smith when the opportunity arises, Black\u2019s\nmechanism will intervene and cause Jones to decide to commit the\nmurder. On the other hand, if Jones decides to murder Smith on her\nown, the mechanism will not intervene. It will merely monitor but will\nnot affect her neurological function. Now suppose that when the\noccasion arises, Jones decides to kill Smith without any\n\u201chelp\u201d from Black\u2019s mechanism. In the judgment of\nFrankfurt and most others, Jones is morally responsible for her act.\nNonetheless, it appears that she is unable to do otherwise since if\nshe had attempted to do so, she would have been thwarted by\nBlack\u2019s device.\n\nMost commentators on examples like this agree that the agent is both\nmorally responsible for her act and acts freely in whatever sense of\nfreedom they endorse. They differ on whether she can do otherwise at\nthe time of her act. Determinists generally interpret the case as one\nin which she exercises compatibilist free will and has no alternate\npossibilities. Most libertarians interpret it as one in which she\nexercises libertarian free will and has alternate possibilities,\ncontrary to appearances. As mentioned above, some philosophers have\ninterpreted it as a case in which she exercises libertarian free will\nbut does not have alternate possibilities. If Frankfurt cases can be\nsuccessfully interpreted in this third way, then they can be used to\nshow the compatibility of infallible foreknowledge and libertarian\nfreedom. Hunt (1999a) argues that this is essentially the solution put\nforward by Augustine in On Free Choice of the Will\nIII.1\u20134, though Augustine\u2019s own considered position on\nfree will was not libertarian.\n\nBut there is another way Frankfurt cases can be used to argue for the\ncompatibility of foreknowledge and freedom. There is an important\ndisanalogy between a Frankfurt case and infallible foreknowledge that\nmight lead one to doubt whether an agent really lacks alternate\npossibilities when her act is infallibly foreknown. A crucial\ncomponent of the standard Frankfurt case is that the agent is\nprevented from acting freely in close possible worlds. That aspect of\nthe case is not in dispute. Black\u2019s device is counterfactually\nmanipulative even if it is not actually manipulative. In contrast,\ninfallible foreknowledge is not even counterfactually manipulative.\nThere is no close possible world in which foreknowledge prevents the\nagent from acting freely. Of course, if theological fatalism is true,\nnobody ever acts freely, but the point is that there is no\nmanipulation going on in other possible worlds in the foreknowledge\nscenario. The relation between foreknowledge and human acts is no\ndifferent in one world than in any other. But it is precisely the fact\nthat the relation between the Frankfurt machine and Mary\u2019s act\ndiffers in the actual world from what it is in other close worlds that\nis supposed to make the Frankfurt example work in showing the falsity\nof PAP.\n\nTo make this point clear, let us look at how the standard Frankfurt\ncase would have to be amended to make it a close analogy to the\nsituation of infallible foreknowledge. As Zagzebski has argued (1991,\nchap. 6, sec. 2.1), the device implanted in Mary\u2019s brain would\nhave to be set in such a way that no matter what Mary did, it never\nintervened. It is not even true that it might have\nintervened. Any world in which Mary decides to commit the murder is a\nworld in which the device is set to make her commit the murder should\nshe not decide to do it, and any world in which she does not decide to\ncommit the murder is a world in which the device is set to prevent her\nfrom deciding to do it if she is about to decide to do it. Now of\ncourse this might be an impossible device, but it would have to be as\ndescribed to be a close analogy to the foreknowledge scenario. And our\nreactions to this amended Frankfurt case are very different from\ntypical reactions to the standard Frankfurt case. In the standard case\nit at least appears to be true that the agent cannot do otherwise,\nwhereas in the case amended to be parallel to the foreknowledge case\nthere is a very straightforward sense in which the agent can do\notherwise because her will is not thwarted by Black in any reasonably\nclose possible world. The machine is ready to manipulate her, but it\ndoes not manipulate her, nor might it have manipulated her since it\ndoes not even manipulate her in counterfactual circumstances. We might\nthink of the machine as a metaphysical accident\u2014an extraneous\naddition to the story that plays no part in the sequence of events in\nany possible world. Possibly it is not clear in the amended story\nwhether or not Mary has alternate possibilities. What the story shows,\nthen, is that alternate possibilities are not always relevant to the\npossession of libertarian freedom.\n\nDisanalogies between the cases are relevant, however, only if the\nprospects for exempting divine foreknowledge from PAP depend on how\nclosely it mimics Frankfurt-type counterexamples. That assumption may\nbe unwarranted. Augustine\u2019s counterexample to PAP was divine\nforeknowledge itself, not a proto-Frankfurtian thought experiment\nfeaturing a counterfactual intervener. Since God infallibly believed\nyesterday that you will answer the phone at 9:00 am tomorrow, there is\nno alternative possibility on which you fail to answer the phone at\n9:00 tomorrow morning; but since \u201ca man does not therefore sin\nbecause God foreknew that he would sin\u201d (CG\nV.10) and, more generally, \u201cGod\u2019s foreknowledge does not\nforce the future to happen\u201d (FCW III.4), we can still\nregard your action as free, even in the libertarian sense. So PAP is\nfalse, for the same reasons Frankfurt pronounced it false in his story\nabout Black, Smith and Jones: God\u2019s foreknowledge, no less than\nBlack\u2019s mechanism, played no role at all in leading the agent to\nperform the action, could have been subtracted from the situation\nwithout making any difference to what happened or why it happened, and\nis completely irrelevant to understanding why the agent acted as she\ndid (Frankfurt 1969, 836\u20137). Divine foreknowledge constitutes\nits own counterexample to PAP (Hunt 2003).\n\nIf this is correct, the following dilemma critique of theological\nfatalism becomes available (Hunt 2017a). Either the argument fails\nsomewhere along the way to (8), or it succeeds up through (8). If it\nfails at one of these earlier steps, it fails full stop. That\u2019s\nthe obvious horn of the dilemma. But if it reaches step (8)\nsuccessfully, and reaches it for those reasons, we have a\ncase in which you cannot do otherwise than answer the phone tomorrow\nmorning, but you are presumptively free in doing so, since you are\nacting on your own, and the circumstances that deprive you of\nalternatives do not in any way explain your action. So (9) is false,\nand it\u2019s falsified by (8). Whether (1)-(8) succeeds or fails,\nthen, the fatalistic inference to (10) is blocked.\n\nNote that this solution shares an intuition with the dependence\nresponse surveyed in 2.5, namely, that God\u2019s foreknowledge is\nexplanatorily dependent on future events, and not the other way\naround. The difference is that the Dependence Solution retains PAP by\ndenying the general necessity of the past, while the\nAugustinian/Frankfurtian approach is to abandon PAP and stick with the\nnecessity of the past.\n3. Incompatibilist responses to the argument for theological fatalism\n\nEver since the dilemma of this article was identified, there have been\nphilosophers who thought that something like our basic argument\nsucceeds in demonstrating that infallible foreknowledge is\nincompatible with human free will. If they are incompatible, one of\nthem must be given up. It\u2019s possible to give up both, of course,\nbut that\u2019s more than the argument requires, and one reason the\ndilemma has attracted so much attention in the history of philosophy\nis that both the belief in a being with infallible foreknowledge and\nbelief in the existence of libertarian free will are strongly\nentrenched in the world view of many philosophers. To give up either\nof these beliefs is difficult and often has many ramifications for\none\u2019s other beliefs.\n\nThe denial of libertarian freedom has always had many supporters. The\nidea of making causal determinism the focal point of discussions of\nfree will is modern in origin, and some philosophers think that the\nmodern framing of the issue is confused. Philosophers who deny\nlibertarian freedom may affirm a type of free will compatible with\ndeterminism, or they may instead simply accept the consequence that\nhuman beings lack free will. It is worth noting, however, that theists\nwho deny libertarian freedom are typically theological\ndeterminists rather than fatalists; it\u2019s\nprimarily considerations of divine omnipotence or sovereignty, rather\nthan foreknowledge, that motivate them. When Augustine, for example,\nrejected human freedom apart from divine control\u2014\u201cI tried\nhard to maintain the free decision of the human will, but the grace of\nGod was victorious\u201d (Retractationes 2.1)\u2014it\nwasn\u2019t because of the fatalist argument from divine\nforeknowedge, which (as we\u2019ve seen) he regarded as a complete\nfailure. Jonathan Edwards, on the other hand, based his Calvinist\ndenial of libertarian freedom, in part, on a sophisticated version of\nthe argument for theological fatalism (FW II.12).\n\nThe other incompatibilist position is to affirm libertarian free will\nalong with the principle of alternate possibilities (premise 9), and\nto deny the possibility of infallible foreknowledge. This position has\nrecently come into prominence through its association with \u201copen\ntheism\u201d (Pinnock et al. 1994). Open theists reject\ndivine timelessness and immutability, along with infallible\nforeknowledge, arguing that not only should foreknowledge be rejected\nbecause of its fatalist consequences, but the view of a God who takes\nrisks, and can be surprised and even disappointed at how things turn\nout, is more faithful to Scripture than the classical notion of an\nessentially omniscient and foreknowing deity (Sanders 1998, Boyd\net al 2001, 13\u201347). See Rhoda et al\n(2006) for an argument that the key issue in the open theism debate is\nthe nature of the future, and Tuggy (2007) for an overview of the\ndifferent positions open theists can take on this question. A reply to\nboth Rhoda et al. and Tuggy may be found in Craig and Hunt\n(2013). Fischer, Todd and Tognazzini (2009) offers a wide-ranging\nappraisal of responses to Pike's argument, paying special\nattention to open theism and issues in the philosophy of time. For an\nargument that open theism necessitates the view that propositions\nabout the future lack truth value, see Arbour (2013). Todd disagrees\non behalf of the open theist, defending (but without endorsing) the\nmutability of the future (2016a), and arguing that future contingents\nare all false rather than truth-valueless (2016b). Boyd (2015)\nattempts to turn the tables against critics on the grounds that the\nopenist God\u2019s knowledge of all the ways the future\nmight go represents more knowledge than the\nclassical theistic God\u2019s knowledge of the way the future\nwill go. Arbour (2019) is a recent collection of commisioned\nessays criticizing open theism on philosophical grounds.\n\nOne influential argument that open theists use against defenders of\nforeknowledge who do not also accept Molinism is that foreknowledge\nwithout middle knowledge is useless for divine providence. In a number\nof papers (1993, 1997, 2009), David Hunt has defended the providential\nutility of foreknowledge without middle knowledge, describing cases in\nwhich foreknowledge enhances God\u2019s providential prospects\nwithout generating the \u201cmetaphysical problem\u201d of\nexplanatory circles, and arguing that the \u201cdoxastic\nproblem\u201d of agential impotence when one already knows what one\nis going to do rests on a principle that is in fact false. Responses\nto Hunt include Kapitan (1993), Basinger (1993), Robinson (2004a,\n2004b), and Hasker (2009). Zimmerman (2012) is friendlier to\nHunt\u2019s position.\n\nA related objection to foreknowledge without middle knowledge is that\nprophecy requires middle knowledge. See Pruss (2007) for a defense of\na foreknowledge-only account of prophecy. Another issue related to\ndivine providence is the efficacy of past-directed prayers. Kevin\nTimpe (2005) argues that adherents of simple foreknowledge or timeless\nknowledge and Molinists have the resources to explain the efficacy of\nprayers about the past, but open theism does not.\n4. Logical fatalism\n\nA form of fatalism that is even older than theological fatalism is\nlogical fatalism, the thesis that the past truth of a proposition\nabout the future entails fatalism. Aristotle discusses this form of\nfatalism in his famous Sea Battle Argument, mentioned in section\n 2.1\n above. A clearer and more sophisticated form of the argument was\nproposed by Diodorus Cronus, whose argument is remarkably similar in\nform to our basic argument for theological fatalism. The logical\nfatalist argument parallels our basic argument as follows:\nArgument for logical fatalism\nLet S = the proposition that there will be a sea battle\ntomorrow.\n\n(1L) Yesterday it was\ntrue that S. [assumption]\n(2L) If some\nproposition was true in the past, it is now-necessary that it was true\nthen. [Form of the Necessity of the Past]\n(3L) It is\nnow-necessary that yesterday it was true that S. [1,\n2]\n(4L) Necessarily, if\nyesterday it was true that S, then now it is true that\nS. [omnitemporality of truth]\n(5L) If it is\nnow-necessary that p and if necessarily (p then\nq), then it is now-necessary that q. [Transfer of Necessity\nPrinciple]\n(6L) Therefore, it is\nnow-necessary that now it is true that S. [3L, 4L,\n5L]\n(7L) If it is\nnow-necessary that now it is true that S, no alternative to\nthe truth of S is now-possible. [definition of\n\u201cnecessary\u201d]\n(8L) So no alternative\nto the truth of S is now-possible [6L, 7L] \n(9L) If no alternative\nto the truth of a proposition about the future is now-possible, then\nwhat the proposition is about will not be brought about by free human\nchoice. [Version of Principle of Alternate Possibilities]\n(10L) Hence, the sea\nbattle tomorrow will not be brought about by free human choice. [8L,\n9L]\n\n\nUnlike the argument for theological fatalism, the argument for logical\nfatalism has few defenders. One reason is that (2L) is less plausible\nthan (2). (3L) is a soft fact about the past, if anything is.\nNevertheless, some philosophers, like Susan Haack (1974) and William\nLane Craig (1987), have maintained that theological fatalism is just a\ngussied up version of logical fatalism, and that the former is no more\nimpressive than the latter once one looks past the theological\nwindow-dressing. This seems to be Merricks\u2019 (2009) position as\nwell, since he holds that theological fatalism fails for essentially\nthe same reason as logical fatalism. Warfield (1997) has argued for\nthe equivalence of the two forms of fatalism if God is necessarily\nexistent and essentially omniscient. Responses have been given by\nHasker (1998) and Brueckner (2000), and Warfield (2000) offers a\nrejoinder to both. Hunt (2002) links Warfield\u2019s argument with\nPlantinga\u2019s (1986), discussed in\n 2.4,\n inasmuch as both exploit the logical equivalence of propositions\nabout the contingent future with God\u2019s believing those\npropositions, and argues that they both fall prey to the same\nreductio: the closure principles they invoke (closure of consistency\nunder logical equivalence for Warfield, closure of hard/soft facthood\nunder logical equivalence for Plantinga) would equally support the\ncompatibility of free will with divine determinism, an unacceptable\nresult for a libertarian. Peter Graham (2008) argues that the\nconsensus about consistency to which Warfield appeals emerged against\nthe backdrop of an assumption that there is no necessarily existent\nbeing, and is therefore question-begging.\n5. Beyond theological fatalism\n\nThere\u2019s more at stake here than the coherence of libertarian\ntheism, as evidenced by the many non-libertarians and non-theists who\nhave contributed to the debate. A comparison might be helpful.\nThere\u2019s more at stake in Zeno\u2019s Achilles paradox than the\nfleetness of Achilles and the torpidity of tortoises. If that\u2019s\nall there was to it, the discovery that Achilles was actually a\nquadraplegic, or that the tortoises of ancient Greece were as fast as\njack rabbits, would resolve the puzzle. But that would simply exempt\nAchilles and/or the tortoise from complicity in the problem; it would\ndo nothing to address the real issues presented by Zeno\u2019s\nargument. The situation is arguably the same when it comes to the\nargument for theological fatalism (Hunt 2017a). If the argument\ngets God wrong by assuming that he\u2019s in time when he\nisn\u2019t, the problem possibly goes away for God, once the mistake\nis corrected, but it\u2019s easily reinstated by replacing God with\nGud, an infallibly omniscient being who exists in time. If the\nargument gets human beings wrong by assuming that they have\n(libertarian) free will when they don\u2019t, the problem can be\nreformulated in terms of Gud\u2019s infallible beliefs about the\nfuture actions of Eleutherians, a race of extraterrestrials stipulated\nto possess libertarian freedom. This is to understand the argument for\ntheological fatalism as a thought experiment. Whether or not divine\nforeknowledge and libertarian freedom are real, we\u2019re being\nasked, what if? Could libertarian freedom really be incompatible with\ndivine foreknowledge for the reasons given in the argument?\nThe answer to this question may involve rethinking more than God and\nfree will.\n\nZagzebski has argued that the dilemma of theological fatalism is\nbroader than a problem about free will. The modal or causal asymmetry\nof time, a transfer of necessity principle, and the supposition of\ninfallible foreknowledge are mutually inconsistent. (1991, appendix).\nIf there is a distinct kind of necessity that the past has\nqua past, and which is not an implicit reference to the lack\nof causability of the past, then it is temporally asymmetrical. The\npast has it and the future does not. The necessity of the past and the\ncontingency of the future are two sides of the same coin. To say that\nthe future is contingent in the sense of temporal modality does not\nimply that we have causal control over the entire future, of course.\nWe lack control over part of the future because part (or even all) of\nit is causally necessary. But if the necessity of the past is distinct\nfrom the lack of causability, and is a type of necessity the past has\njust because it is past, the future must lack that particular kind of\nnecessity.\n\nThe idea that there is temporally asymmetrical modality is\ninconsistent with the transfer of necessity principle and the\nsupposition of infallible foreknowledge of an essentially omniscient\ndeity. The inconsistency can be demonstrated as follows:\n\nDilemma of Foreknowledge and Modal Temporal Asymmetry\n\nAgain, let T = the proposition that you will answer the\ntelephone tomorrow at 9 am.\n\n(1f) There is (and was\nbefore now) an essentially omniscient foreknower (EOF) [Assumption for\ndilemma]\n\n\n(1f) and the Principle of the Necessity of the Past tells us that\n\n(2f) Either it is\nnow-necessary that the EOF believed T before now or it is\nnow-necessary that the EOF believed not T before now.\n\n\n\nFrom (1f) and the definition of an EOF it follows that\n\n(3f) Necessarily (The\nEOF believed before now that T \u2192 T), and\nnecessarily (The EOF believed before now that not T \u2192\nnot T). \n\n\nBy the Transfer of Necessity Principle (TNP), (2f) and (3f) entail\n\n(4f) Either it is\nnow-necessary that T or it is now-necessary that not\nT.\n\n\n(4f) is logically equivalent to\n\n(5f) Either it is not\nnow-possible that T or it is not now-possible that not\nT.\n\n\nFrom the Principle of the Contingency of the Future we get\n\n(6f) It is now-possible\nthat T and it is now-possible that not\nT.\n\n\nBut (6f) contradicts (5f).\n\nThe inconsistency shown in this argument has nothing to do with free\nwill or fatalism. In fact, the problem is even more general than this\nargument illustrates. The reason essential omniscience conflicts with\ntemporal modality and the transfer principle is that the existence of\nan EOF requires that a proposition about the past entails a\nproposition about the future. But it straightforwardly follows from\nTNP that a proposition that is now-necessary cannot entail a\nproposition that is not now-necessary. So if the past is now-necessary\nand the future is not, a proposition about the past cannot entail a\nproposition about the future. The conclusion is that if asymmetrical\ntemporal modality is coherent, it can obey TNP, or it can permit a\nproposition about the past to entail a proposition about the future,\nbut not both.\n\nThe root of the problem, then, is that it is impossible for there to\nbe a type of modality that has the following features:\n\n(a) The past and future\nare asymmetrical in that the past qua past is necessary with respect\nto this type of modality, whereas the future qua future is contingent\nwith respect to this type of modality.\n(b) There are\npropositions about the past that entail propositions about the future.\n\n(c) TNP\nobtains.\n\n\nSo the problem of the alleged incompatibility of infallible\nforeknowledge and free will is a special case of a more general\nproblem about time and necessity. It was suggested in section\n 2.6\n that the problem may be (a) above. There is no temporally\nasymmetrical necessity. But regardless of what one thinks of fatalist\narguments, the general problem in the logic of time and causation\nneeds to be addressed. Both the alleged modal asymmetry of time and\nthe causal asymmetry should be examined in more detail.\n\nThe problem of foreknowledge and fatalism has been around for a long\ntime, but the amount of philosophical attention it has attracted since\n1965 is truly remarkable. The literature on this problem is enormous,\nand it continues to grow. \n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Adams, Marilyn, 1967, \u201cIs the Existence of God a\n\u2018Hard\u2019 Fact?\u201d <em>Philosophical Review</em>, 76(4):\n492\u2013503.", "Adams, Robert Merrihew, 1991, \u201cAn Anti-Molinist\nArgument,\u201d <em>Philosophical Perspectives</em> (Volume 5:\nPhilosophy of Religion), James Tomberlin (ed)., Atascadero, CA:\nRidgeview, pp. 343\u2013354.", "Alston, William P., 1985, \u201cDivine Foreknowledge and\nAlternative Conceptions of Human Freedom,\u201d <em>International\nJournal for Philosophy of Religion</em>, 18(1): 19\u201332.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1986, \u201cDoes God Have Beliefs?\u201d\n<em>Religious Studies</em>, 22 (Sept/Dec): 287\u2013306.", "Aquinas, St. Thomas, <em>Summa Theologica</em>, Ia, q. 14, art\n13.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, <em>Summa Contra Gentiles</em> I, chap.\n66.", "Arbour, Benjamin H., 2013, \u201cFuture Freedom and the Fixity of\nTruth: Closing the Road to Limited Foreknowledge Open Theism,\u201d\n<em>International Journal for Philosophy of Religion</em>, 73(3):\n189\u2013207.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013 (ed.), 2019, <em>Philosophical Essays\nAgainst Open Theism</em>, London: Routledge.", "Augustine, <em>The City of God</em>, trans.
