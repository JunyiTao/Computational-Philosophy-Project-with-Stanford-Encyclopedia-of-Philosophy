    "main_text": "Normative Power Theory || Ancient Views\n1.1 Ancient Views\n\nRepresentative of the ancient view, for Aristotle promise-keeping is\ndirectly mandated by the virtues, in particular those of justice, as\nwell as liberality in cases of purely gratuitous promises:\n\n\nLet us discuss them both, but first of all the truthful man. We are\nnot speaking of the man who keeps faith in his agreements, i.e., in\nthe things that pertain to justice or injustice (for this would belong\nto another excellence[this would be the virtue of justice]), but the\nman who in the matters in which nothing of this sort is at stake is\ntrue both in word and in life because his character is such. But such\na man would seem to be as a matter of fact equitable. For the man who\nloves truth, and is truthful where nothing is at stake, will still\nmore be truthful where something is at stake; he will avoid falsehood\nas something base, seeing that he avoided it even for its own sake;\nand such a man is worthy of praise. He inclines rather to understate\nthe truth; for this seems in better taste because exaggerations are\nwearisome. (Nicomachean Ethics, iv. vii,\n1127a\u20131127b)\n\n\nThe Roman Jurists like Cicero and Gaius developed this sort of view\nfurther, crucially conceiving of a specific moral duty to keep\npromises, and a specific (and for Cicero particularly Roman)\nvirtue of fidelity to promises (see Cicero, De Officiis 1.8)\nas well as formalizing promissory obligations, by reference to a\nspecific procedure called the stipulatio or stipulating:\n\n\nA verbal obligation is created by question and answer in such form as:\n\u201cDo you solemnly promise conveyance? I solemnly promise\nconveyance\u201d; \u201cWill you convey? I will convey\u201d;\n\u201cDo you promise? I promise\u201d; \u201cDo you promise on your\nhonour? I promise on my honour\u201d; \u201cDo you guarantee on your\nhonour? I guarantee on my honour\u201d; \u201cWill you do? I will\ndo\u201d (Gaius, Inst. 3.92, cited in Swain 2013)\n\n",
