    "main_text": "Theoretical Options for Natural Law Theorists || Knowledge of the basic goods\n2.2 Knowledge of the basic goods\n\nAnother central question that the natural law tradition has wrestled\nwith concerns our knowledge of the basic goods. How can we come to\nknow these fundamental goods?\n\nReturn to Aquinas\u2019s paradigmatic natural law position. His\naccount of our knowledge of the fundamental goods has been understood\nin different ways (Murphy 2001, ch. 1). Some have understood Aquinas\nas affirming a theory of our knowledge of the fundamental precepts of\nthe natural law that we can label \u2018derivationism.\u2019\u00a0\nThe idea here is that we can derive from a metaphysical study of human\nnature and its potentialities and actualizations the conclusion that\ncertain things are good for human beings, and thus that the primary\nprecepts of the natural law bid us to pursue these things (cf. Lisska\n1996). One can imagine a Hobbesian version of this view as well. One\nmight say that by a careful study of the human being\u2019s\ndesire-forming mechanisms, one can see that there are certain things\nthat would be necessarily desired by biologically sound human beings,\nand thus that the human good includes these items. (Hobbes in fact\nproduces such arguments at [EL], I, 7.)\u00a0 While a natural law\ntheorist might downplay the importance of derivationist knowledge of\nthe natural law, it is hard to see how a consistent natural law\ntheorist could entirely reject the possibility of such\nknowledge, given the view that we can provide a substantial account of\nhow the human good is grounded in nature: for to show that the human\ngood is grounded in nature is to show that human nature explains why\ncertain things are goods, and it is hard to see how one could affirm\nthat claim while entirely rejecting the possibility of derivationist\nknowledge of the human good (see Murphy 2001, pp. 16\u201317). Some\nhave thought, echoing criticisms of natural law theory by those\nentirely hostile to it, that derivationist theories of practical\nknowledge fall prey to \u2018Hume\u2019s Law,\u2019 that it is\nimpossible to derive an \u2018ought\u2019 from an \u2018is,\u2019\nthat is, any normative truth from any set of nonnormative truths. The\nmost that this can show, though, is that the natural law theorist\nneeds an account of those bridge truths that enable us to move between\nclaims about human nature and claims about human goods.\n\nIt must be conceded, however, that a consistent natural law theorist\ncould hardly hold that derivationist knowledge of the human good is\nthe only such knowledge possible. For it is part of the paradigm\nnatural law view that the basic principles of the natural law are\nknown by all, and the sort of arguments that would need to be made in\norder to produce derivationist knowledge of the human good are\ncertainly not had (or even have-able) by all. (Recently Jensen (2015)\nhas offered a thorough defense of a derivationist account that aims to\ntake such worries into account.) Another way that Aquinas\u2019s\naccount of knowledge of the fundamental goods has been understood\n\u2014 and it is an understanding better able to come to grips with\nthe widespread knowledge of fundamental goods \u2014 can be labeled\n\u2018inclinationism.\u2019\u00a0 On this view, one\u2019s explicit\ngrasp of the fundamental goods follows upon but is not derived from\none\u2019s persistent directedness toward the pursuit of certain\nends, which directedness involves an implicit grasp of these items as\ngood. So human beings exhibit a tendency to pursue life, and\nknowledge, and friendship, and so forth; and reflection on this\ntendency occasions an immediate grasp of the truth that life, and\nknowledge, and friendship, and so forth are goods. The affirmation of\nthe claims \u2018life is good,\u2019 \u2018knowledge is\ngood,\u2019 \u2018friendship is good,\u2019 etc. makes intelligible\nthe persistent pursuit of these ends by rational beings like us.\n\nWhile inclinationism and derivationism are distinct methods, they are\nby no means exclusive: one can hold that knowledge of fundamental\ngoods is possible in both ways. Indeed, it may well be that one way of\nknowing can supplement and correct the other. There may be some goods\nthat are easier to recognize when taking the speculative point of\nview, the point of view of the observer of human nature and its\npotentialities, and some that are easier to recognize when taking the\npractical point of view, the point of view of the actively engaged in\nhuman life. Indeed, by connecting nature and the human good so\ntightly, the natural law view requires that an account of the good\nreconcile these points of view.\n\nThere are, of course, reasons to be worried about both of these ways\nof knowing basic goods \u2014 worries that go beyond general\nskeptical doubts about how we could know any normative truths at\nall.\u00a0 Derivationists have to explain how we come to know what\ncounts as an actualization of a human potency, and have to explain how\nwe connect these via bridge principles with human goods.\nInclinationists have their own troubles. In particular, they need to\ndeal with the fact that, even if they are not in the business of\nderiving goods from inclinations or identifying the goods precisely\nwith what we tend to pursue, they take as their starting point human\ndirectedness.\u00a0\u00a0 And it has been rightly noted that human\ndirectedness is not always a lovely thing. Power and prestige seem to\nbe a matter of human directedness \u2014 at least as much so as,\nsay,\u00a0 aesthetic enjoyment and speculative knowledge \u2014 but\nthey do not make it to the natural law theorist\u2019s catalog of\ngoods (though they do appear to be part of the good in\nAristotle\u2019s picture; cf. the discussion in Hare 2001, p. 14).\nWhile these difficulties persist for inclinationist and derivationist\naccounts of knowledge of the basic goods, they may well be eased if\none affirms both accounts: one might be able to use inclinationist\nknowledge to provide some basis for bridge principles between\nknowledge of human nature and knowledge of human goods, and one might\nbe able to use derivationist knowledge to modify, in a non-ad-hoc way,\nthe objectionable elements of the account that one might be bound to\ngive if proceeding on an inclinationist basis alone. (Reconciling the\ninclinationist and derivationist approaches is a theme in Murphy 2001\nand Wall 2010.)\n\nThe dialectic between inclinationist and derivationist accounts of\nknowledge of the first principles of the natural law is central to\nnatural law epistemology, but there are other accounts of knowledge of\nthe natural law that focus on its social dimension. Alasdair MacIntyre\nhas argued, for example, that the first precepts of the natural law\nare to be understood as those that make possible communal inquiry into\nthe nature of the good: both the positive and the negative precepts\nare enabling rules, norms that enable humans to engage in common\npursuit of knowledge of what is valuable. The norms of the natural law\npreclude our acting toward other potential partners in inquiry in way\nthat would undermine the possibility of common pursuit of the good\n(MacIntyre 1994, 183\u2013184). To come to know the primary precepts\nof the natural law, then, is a matter of coming to know what sorts of\nsocial relationships make possible common pursuit of common goods.\n\n\nA distinct sort of social emphasis on knowledge of the natural law\nasks why we should think of knowledge of the natural law as arising\nexclusively or even predominantly either from one\u2019s own\nimmediate rational insight into what is implicit grasped or from some\nsort of derivation from the fact that one\u2019s own inclinations of\nthe will have certain determinate objects. One might hold that we have\nexcellent reason to believe that knowledge of the natural law unfolds\nhistorically. Jean Porter, for example, argues that by close attention\nto the various sorts of social structure exhibited cross-culturally,\nwe can extract the necessary \u201cstarting points\u201d (Porter\n2005, p.  132) to begin assessing various proposed norms of\naction. And Jonathan Crowe emphasizes knowledge of the natural law as\nthe outcome of the attempt to interpret human practices, and will be\nan historically-extended process that will be necessarily an\nunfinished task (Crowe 2019, pp. 6-7; there is also discussion of\ninterpretation of social practices as a means to knowing the natural\nlaw in Murphy 2007).\n",
