Both texts have been translated and annotated along with the\noriginal Chinese characters by A. Charles Muller (2015) in\nKorea\u2019s Great Buddhist-Confucian Debate, as well as the\nrebuttal of Hamh\u01d2 Kihwa (1376\u20131433), an erudite Confucian\ntrained Buddhist, in his treatise entitled\nHy\u01d2nj\u01d2ng-non (\u986f\u6b63\u8ad6) [The\nExposition of the Correct].\n\nCh\u014fng, while investigating the phenomenological issues concerning\nhuman nature and their ethical implications, was completely unwilling\nto acknowledge any conceptual dependence on Buddhist doctrines, while\nreinforcing the staunch position of Neo-Confucians in Korea to link\nphilosophical principles to one\u2019s social reality (see Muller\n2015: introduction). For Confucians, Buddhists had cut themselves off\nfrom both social and filial obligations. His ideas, therefore,\n\u201cprovide grounded guidelines for individuals as social beings\nwho faced daily challenges\u201d and this is exemplified by the\nrecent translation of his writings as Seeking Order in a\nTumultuous Age (Robinson (trans.) 2016: here 5). These writings\nreflect the need to help the people, as well as the need to rectify\nthe mind of the ruler, but also the obligation to rectify oneself\nbefore trying to rectify others (Robinson (trans.) 2016:\n128\u2013129). They also recount the practical reasons behind his\nphilosophical attack of Buddhism:\n\n\nthe bulk of the Finance Commission is spent on Buddhism and deities.\nThere is no greater waste of fiscal resources. (trans. in Robinson\n2016: 53)\n\n\nThese are ideas that later scholars might refer to as \u201cpractical\nlearning\u201d or Sirhak, often described as a trend that\nemerged after the Hideyoshi invasions of the late sixteenth century,\nyet here we have very practical guidance from Ch\u014fng at the start\nof the Chos\u014fn dynasty, or rather the beginnings of a practical\nform of \u201csage\u201d learning applied to issues directly related\nto daily life.\n\nCh\u014fng\u2019s shorter rebuttal of Buddhism, On Mind, Material\nForce and Principle (Simgiri p\u2019y\u014fn:\n45\u201353), already highlights this intellectual nexus which\ndominates Neo-Confucianism in Korea. It introduces the main\nmetaphysical issues that were of great importance in Korea at this\ntime, namely, the mind (\u5fc3; also referred to in literature as\nthe heart-and-mind), the material force (\u6c23), and of course\nPrinciple (\u7406), which he describes as \u201cthe\ninherent virtue of the mind and that through which material force is\nproduced\u201d, and clearly states that \u201conly after there is\nprinciple is there material force\u201d (Simgiri\np\u2019y\u014fn: 50). He discusses what he considers to be the\nmisinterpretation and application of ideas in the teachings of the\nBuddhists and Daoists, vindicating his rebuttal with quotes from the\nMencius, the Analects, and the writings of Zhu Xi,\nas well as the Book of Rites. Ch\u014fng\u2019s arguments\nculminate in a radical espousal of Confucianism as an exclusivistic\ndiscourse, and he lauds the practical and direct social implications\nof these metaphysical ideas, juxtaposed to Buddhist and Daoist\nemphasis on emptiness and vacuity, which he considers to be devoid of\nmeaning when related to matters of the mundane world (Simgiri\np\u2019y\u014fn: 53). The philosophical implications of\nCh\u014fng\u2019s ideas are related to this-worldly affairs and not\nspeculative spiritual proclivities of other traditions, which he\nsuggests depended on deities who could then reward or punish.\nCh\u014fng asserts the need to investigate one\u2019s human nature\nand the mind for oneself, and not to rely on teachings that call upon\nspirits to do so, advocating the Confucian practice of preserving what\nis good in the mind and nourishing the material force to control\nbodily desires through proper Confucian education (Simgiri\np\u2019y\u014fn: 51). This bifocal approach would become greatly\nelucidated by later Neo-Confucian philosophers who would advocate an\napproach to fully develop the humanity (K. in) that our minds\nwere \u201cnaturally\u201d endowed with by Principle.\n\nCh\u014fng\u2019s Pulssi Chappy\u014fn is translated by\nMuller (2015) under the title An Array of Critiques of\nBuddhism. The text lists 19 critiques, which Ch\u014fng\nsystematically treats in turn, including important Buddhist doctrines,\nsuch as transmigration and karma. The goal of Confucianism, being\nfirmly focused on this life, was not interested in idle speculation\nabout an afterlife. Initially, Ch\u014fng (Pulssi\nChappy\u014fn: 59\u201361) sets out to critique the Buddhists\ninterpretations of the mind (K. sim), and human nature (K.\ns\u014fng), and criticises the Kory\u014f monk Chinul of\n\u201cnebulous supposition\u201d, lacking \u201chard facts\u201d,\naccusing Buddhists of \u201cword play\u201d, while lacking a\ndefinitive doctrine. Ch\u014fng explains that the Confucians consider\nthe mind to be made of the material force that \u201cone takes from\nheaven at birth\u201d, while the mind itself is endowed by\none\u2019s human nature through Principle at birth\n(Pulssi Chappy\u014fn: 59). He reinforces the\n\u201cconcrete\u201d aspect of the \u201cfunction\u201d of\nConfucianism in reality, which the Buddhists consider completely\nillusory, and refers to Cheng Yi\u2019s dictum,\n\n\nThe study of the Buddhists includes reverence to correct the internal,\nbut does not include justice to straighten the external. (Pulssi\nChappy\u014fn: 63)\n\n\nCheng Hao had similarly added that \u201cThe Buddhist way of internal\nand external life is incomplete\u201d (SB-Chan: 538). This Confucian\nrationale underpins Ch\u014fng\u2019s arguments in his\n\u201cCritique of the Buddhists\u2019 Abandonment of the Basic Human\nRelationships\u201d and the \u201cBuddhist Notion of\nCompassion\u201d, initiating his discourse (Pulssi\nChappy\u014fn: 64\u201367) on the Confucian virtue of humanity\n(K. in), which functions through social interactions,\nmanifested through \u201cThe Five Relationships\u201d. Furthermore,\nCh\u014fng denounces Buddhists for rejecting filial piety, adding that\nthey \u201cregard their most intimate family members like passers-by\non the street\u201d, despite having inherited their material force\nfrom their parents, illustrating how Neo-Confucians now used\nmetaphysics to validate their moral \u201creality\u201d (Pulssi\nChappy\u014fn: 66).\n\nAs Buddhists could take refuge in the Buddha, thereby rely on\nsomething external, the point is excoriated by Ch\u01d2ng in his\ncritique of S\u014fn Buddhists and their teachings (Pulssi\nChappy\u014fn: 72\u201373), who he insinuates,\n\n\ntook nothingness [\u7a7a, K. kong; this was the translation\nof the Sanskrit term \u015a\u016bnyat\u0101] as their cardinal\nteaching and abandoned the obligations of society,\n\n\ncontrasting it greatly with the practical \u201cway\u201d of\nConfucianism, further emphasised in his, \u201cCritique of the\nEquivalence and Differences between Confucianism and Buddhism\u201d\n(Pulssi Chappy\u014fn: 73\u201377). Ch\u014fng accuses\nBuddhists of being \u201cmasters of glibness, lewdness, trickiness,\nand evasiveness\u201d (Pulssi Chappy\u014fn: 77). In\ncontrast, the role of the Confucian \u201csage\u201d is also acutely\nheralded as a pragmatic pathway that has use for governing, to plan\nfor the welfare of the people and to \u201cavoid activities that\nwould bring harm to [them]\u201d, ideas that are also emphasised in\nhis practical handbook for governance, Seeking Order in a\nTumultuous Age, discussed above (Robinson (trans.) 2016: 81).\n\nCh\u014fng\u2019s text draws together multiple quotes by renowned\nConfucian scholars to fuel his arguments and support his overall view\nthat Buddhism had no practical social worth. As Muller (1999: 185)\nunderscores, such ideas were closely linked to the Confucian\nunderstanding that \u201cBuddhists regarded existence as illusory and\nthat only mind was real\u201d, hence they \u201cscorned human\nrelationships\u201d, while \u201conly quiet meditative inner\ncultivation was valued\u201d. The most important retort to this\ndiatribe would come from the monk Hamh\u01d2 Kihwa, who skillfully\ncounter-charges Ch\u014fng\u2019s caustic attack using Confucian\nideas and texts, while encouraging a much more inclusivistic, hence\nless divisive, approach. Kihwa (Hy\u01d2nj\u01d2ng-non:\n110\u2013111), argued for the \u201cunity of the Three\nTeachings\u201d, giving a valid piece of advice about what not to do\nthat is useful for us to hear today:\n\n\nHolding stubbornly onto one\u2019s own opinion while ignoring the\npositions of others, arbitrarily affirming this and rejecting\nthat.\n\n",
