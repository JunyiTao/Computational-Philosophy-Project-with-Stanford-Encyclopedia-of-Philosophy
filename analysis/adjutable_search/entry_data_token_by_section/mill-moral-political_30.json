    "main_text": "Sexual Equality || Millian Feminism\n5.4 Millian Feminism\n\nThis is a significant blemish on Mill\u2019s feminist credentials. He\nsometimes assumed that a traditional sexual division of labor was\nnatural in the sense that it was likely to emerge in a culture of\nequal opportunity for all. Given Mill\u2019s recognition that the\nexisting division of labor was produced and sustained in conditions of\nsexual discrimination and unequal opportunity, there is no basis for\nsupposing that this division of labor would survive a culture of\nequality. However, it is Mill himself that supplies the resources for\ncriticizing his assumption. That ought to provide partial mitigation\nof his mistake.\n\nOtherwise, Mill\u2019s feminist credentials are strong. He is a keen\ncritic of domestic and social forms of inequality, recognizing the\nharm such practices cause women and the ways in which they deform the\nlives of boys and men too. Victorian marriage law, the denial of the\nfranchise, and lack of social and economic opportunities violate\nhigher-order interests of women. These rights violations are a matter\nof serious social injustice. The corollary of these criticisms is that\nMill is a staunch defender of equal opportunity for women and an\neloquent spokesman for the way in which a culture of equality would\ntransform the lives of girls and women, liberating their creative\npotential and emotional sensibilities, and make possible more\nproductive social cooperation and friendships among equals.\n\nMill\u2019s discussion of sexual equality is one place where the\nperfectionist underpinnings of his liberal principles play an\nimportant role and add to the depth of his criticisms of sexual\ndiscrimination and his case for sexual equality. His defense of sexual\nequality highlights the genuinely progressive aspects of his\nutilitarian and liberal commitments.\n",
