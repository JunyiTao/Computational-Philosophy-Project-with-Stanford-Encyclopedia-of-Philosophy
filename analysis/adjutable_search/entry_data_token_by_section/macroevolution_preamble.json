    "main_text": "\n\nMacroevolution refers (most of the time, in practice) to evolutionary\npatterns and processes above the species level. It is usually\ncontrasted with microevolution, or evolutionary change within\npopulations. This customary way of drawing the macro/micro distinction\nis not perfect, however, because species sometimes consist of multiple\npopulations. Some evolutionary processes, such as the spread of a\ntrait from one population to another, might count as within-species\nprocesses but not within-population processes.\n Population genetics (see entry),\n which emerged during the modern synthesis of the early- to\nmid-twentieth century, explains within-population microevolutionary\nchange in terms of\n natural selection,\n genetic drift, mutation, and migration.\n\nOne question that looms over philosophical work on macroevolutionary\ntheory is how macroevolution and microevolution are related. One view,\nwhich is closely associated with the modern synthesis, is that\nmacroevolutionary patterns are fully explicable in terms of\nmicroevolutionary processes. On this view, macroevolution is\n\u201cnothing but\u201d successive rounds of microevolution (a\nformulation due to Grantham 2007). Stephen Jay Gould pejoratively\nreferred to this kind of view as \u201cextrapolationism\u201d (Gould\n2002). This issue links up with more general philosophical questions\nabout the potential reduction of higher-level biological phenomena to\nlower levels (Oppenheimer & Putnam 1958; Fodor 1974; Kitcher 1984;\nSarkar 1992, Rosenberg 1997).\n\nDuring the paleobiological revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, a number\nof paleontologists sought to establish paleontology\u2019s status as\nan evolutionary discipline, with something to say about evolutionary\ntheory. This shift was reflected in the decision to use the term\n\u2018paleobiology\u2019 (Sepkoski & Ruse 2009). For some of these\nscientists of the 1970s\nand 1980s, the disciplinary autonomy of paleobiology was closely\nlinked to ideas about macroevolution. As Steven Stanley (1975) put it,\ntheir thought was that macroevolution is \u201cuncoupled\u201d from\nmicroevolution, and that macroevolutionary patterns sometimes require\nexplanation in terms of macro-level processes. One early move in this\ndirection was the construction of the MBL model (Gould, Raup,\nSepkoski, Schopf, and Simberloff 1977), a computer simulation of\nmacroevolutionary processes that explicitly ignored microevolutionary\nfactors such as natural selection (Sepkoski 2012). Today, this\napproach is sometimes known as the \u201chierarchical\nexpansion\u201d of evolutionary theory, and it remains the focus of\nquite a bit of theoretical work (see, e.g., Eldredge, Pievani,\nSerrelli, & Temkin 2016).\n\nSince the 1970s, theorizing about macroevolution has focused on\nseveral important ideas: punctuated equilibria, species selection,\nhierarchical theory, historical contingency, passive vs. driven\nevolutionary trends, major evolutionary transitions, and more recently\nthe zero-force evolutionary law (or ZFEL) defended by McShea\nand Brandon (2010). One philosophical challenge is to understand the\nrelationships among these ideas; another is to work out what they\nmight mean for the relationship between macro- and microevolution.\n\nThe fossil record is the chief source of empirical evidence concerning\nmacroevolutionary patterns, and so macroevolutionary theory is closely\nassociated with paleontology. In addition to questions of\nmacroevolutionary theory per se, there are also\nepistemological questions about how paleontologists infer pattern from\nprocess, and how they correct for biases in the fossil data (Bokulich\nforthcoming). In addition, the distinction between macroevolution and\nmicroevolution sometimes mirrors the distinction between paleontology,\nwith its focus on the fossil record, and neontology, with its focus on\nobservable, extant populations. For this reason, metaphysical\nquestions about the relationship between macro- and microevolution are\nsometimes difficult to disentangle from epistemological questions\nabout what sorts of things can be inferred from different evidence\nbases.\n",
