    "main_text": "Creation and the big bang || Should the theist look for confirmation from scientific cosmology?\n2.2 Should the theist look for confirmation from scientific cosmology?\n\nAccording to traditional Christian theism, creation ex nihilo\nis miraculous\u2014something which the laws of nature cannot explain.\nBut then why should a theist expect to be able to derive creation\nex nihilo from the laws of nature? Compare with other\nsupposed miracles, e.g., within Christianity the claim that Jesus\nchanged water into wine. Do Christian theists claim that chemistry\nshould predict that water can transform into wine? Of course not: God\nis supposed to be able to transcend the laws of nature, and the laws\nof nature are defeasible when it comes to describing what actually did\nhappen (since God could have intervened). But then couldn\u2019t the\nbest (most explanatory, most elegant) cosmological theory posit an\ninfinite past, whereas in reality God created it some finite time in\nthe past?\n\nThe puzzle we have just encountered trades on the special status of\ncosmology as a historical, yet law-based science, with only one actual\nmodel. While theists would certainly not expect the laws of chemistry\nto predict that water can transform into wine, they do believe that an\naccurate historical account would include reference to those miracles\nthat did occur. So, is cosmology more like history, or more like\nchemistry? If God did create the universe, should a cosmological\ntheory report (or predict or entail) such a fact? Or should cosmology\nonly be required to provide laws for universes, laws which might in\nfact have been broken in our universe?\n",
