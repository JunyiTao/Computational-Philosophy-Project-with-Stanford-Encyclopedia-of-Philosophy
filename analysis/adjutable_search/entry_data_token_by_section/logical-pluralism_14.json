    "main_text": "Further Kinds of Logical Pluralism || Pluralism Regarding the Set of Logical Constants\n5.1 Pluralism Regarding the Set of Logical Constants\n\nAchille Varzi (2002) points out that one way to generate competing\nrelations of logical consequence is to vary the set of expressions\nthat we treat as logical constants. If we take \u201c=\u201d to be a\nlogical constant, then the following argument will be valid:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{l}\nFa\\\\\na=b\\\\ \\hline\nFb\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n\nBut if the set of logical constants does not include \u201c=\u201d\nthen it will not be valid, since our models will now include those\nthat assign non-reflexive relations to \u201c=\u201d, and these can\ngenerate counter-examples.\n\nShould \u201c=\u201d be treated as a logical constant? Tarski\nhimself endorsed the view that any expression in the language\nmight be taken to be logical:\n\n\nThe division of all terms of the language discussed into logical and\nextra-logical\u2026 is certainly not quite arbitrary. If, for\nexample, we were to include among the extra-logical signs the\nimplication sign, or the universal quantifier, then our definition of\nthe concept of consequence would lead to results which obviously\ncontradict ordinary usage. On the other hand no objective grounds are\nknown to me which permit us to draw a sharp boundary between the two\ngroups of terms. It seems to me possible to include among the logical\nterms some which are usually regarded by logicians as extra-logical\nwithout running into consequences which stand in sharp contrast to\nordinary usage\u2026 In the extreme case we could regard all terms\nof the language as logical. (Tarski 1936 [1956: 418\u2013419])\n\n\nVarzi is inclined to endorse Tarski\u2019s liberalism with respect to\nthe choice of logical constants:\n\n\nThe relevant claim is that all (or any) terms of the language could in\nprinciple be regarded \u201cas logical\u201d\u2014and I agree with\nthat. (Varzi 2002: 200)\n\n\nThe result is that on his view there is more than one correct relation\nof logical consequence, since that relation is relative to the choice\nof logical constants, and there is more than one equally correct set\nof these, resulting in different, equally correct logics.\n\nThe Tarksi/Varzi view is controversial. Varzi defends it in his paper\nof 2002 and there is useful discussion in the entry on\n logical constants.\n",
