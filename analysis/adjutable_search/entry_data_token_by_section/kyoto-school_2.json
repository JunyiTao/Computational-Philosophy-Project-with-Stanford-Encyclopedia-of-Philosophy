    "main_text": "Identity and Membership: Who Belongs to What? || The Question of Definition\n2.2 The Question of Definition\n\nAt the start of the twenty-first century, two important volumes\nappeared in Japanese with the name \u201cKyoto School\u201d in their\ntitles: The Philosophy of the Kyoto School, edited by Fujita\nMasakatsu (2001; translated into English as Fujita 2018), which\nconsists of an anthology of texts by eight Kyoto School thinkers\ntogether with an essay on each one by a contemporary scholar; and\nThe Thought of the Kyoto School, edited by \u014chashi\nRy\u014dsuke (2004), which contains five essays detailing the\ncontroversial history of the name \u201cKyoto School\u201d as well\nas seven essays on potential contributions of their thought to various\nfields of contemporary philosophy. While the two books complement one\nother in many respects, they nevertheless suggest somewhat different\napproaches to defining the school.\n\nFujita agrees with Takeda Atsushi\u2019s working definition of the\nKyoto School as: \u201cthe intellectual network that was centered on\nNishida and Tanabe, and mutually formed by those who were directly\ninfluenced in both a personal and scholarly manner by them\u201d\n(Fujita 2001, ii and 234\u201335). Accordingly, Fujita\u2019s book\nfeatures such thinkers as Tosaka and Miki, as well as unanimously\naccepted figures such as Hisamatsu Shinichi (1889\u20131980) and\nNishitani. As Fujita points out, the relatively open definition of the\nKyoto School as such a scholarly and interpersonal\n\u201cnetwork\u201d has the advantage of highlighting the mutuality\nof the flow of influence between its members, as well as the fact that\n\u201cmembership\u201d in the unofficial group did not preclude\nserious disagreement with the thought of Nishida or Tanabe. While\ncritical exchanges did sometimes lead to severed personal relations\n(e.g., Nishida and Tanabe infamously stopped speaking to one another),\nthis was not always the case (e.g., Nishitani and Tosaka remained on\ngood personal terms despite their political and philosophical\ndifferences). In either case mutual criticism was philosophically\ntaken seriously, and it frequently provided impetus to further\ndevelopments in each member\u2019s thought. In this sense, according\nto Fujita, an acceptance of mutual criticism could well be considered\none of the defining characteristics of the School.\n\nOne point made by Tosaka early on, a point often repeated today, is\nthat without Tanabe\u2019s critical appropriation of\nNishida\u2019s thought there would be no tradition of the Kyoto\nSchool; we would have only successors of \u201cNishidian\nPhilosophy\u201d and not a genuine school of mutually related yet\nindependent thinkers. The question remains, however, just how\nindependent a thinker can be with respect to Nishida\u2019s thought\nand still be considered a member of the School. For even when\nsubsequent figures in the School sharply questioned certain aspects of\nNishida\u2019s thought, they tended at the same time to appropriate\nand creatively develop other shared concepts and motifs. A movement of\nself-critical development can in fact be seen in the ceaseless\nprogression of Nishida\u2019s own thinking. Nishida considered\nhimself to be a \u201cminer of ore\u201d who never managed to stay\nput in one stage of development long enough to refine the ideas he had\nunearthed (Nishida 1958, vii; on the development of Nishida\u2019s\nthought, see Fujita 2020 and the entry on Nishida Kitar\u014d).\n\nHence the Kyoto School, like many other vibrant schools of thought,\nshould be seen as a cluster of original thinkers who, while not\nuncritically subscribing to any prescribed dogma, nevertheless came to\nshare, and debate, a number of common motifs as well as basic concepts\nand terminology. As we shall see, the most fundamental of their shared\nand disputed concepts is that of \u201cabsolute nothingness,\u201d a\nconcept that has, in fact, most often been used as a thematic axis for\ndefining the School.\n\nIn contrast to Fujita, \u014chashi explicitly questions the\nappropriateness of defining the Kyoto School merely in terms of a\nnetwork of personal and scholarly relations. According to \u014chashi,\nin order for a group of thinkers to form a genuine\n\u201cschool\u201d of philosophy, \u201cthere must be the common\npossession or formation of a thought\u201d (\u014chashi 2004, 9). For\n\u014chashi, this common thought of the Kyoto School is that of\nabsolute nothingness, and he accordingly suggests the following as a\ndefinition of the School: \u201ca group of philosophers spanning\nseveral generations who developed their thought in several areas of\nphilosophy with the idea of \u2018nothingness\u2019 as a\nbasis\u201d (ibid., 10; see \u014chashi 2001, 13). While he does\ninclude Hattori Kenji\u2019s essay on the \u201cleft wing of the\nKyoto School\u201d as the opening chapter of his The Thought of\nthe Kyoto School, previously \u014chashi explicitly excluded Miki\nfrom the School on account of his principally Marxists orientations\n(\u014chashi 1990, 12). However, we should note that while Miki did\nnot maintain a strict adherence to Marxism (see Curley 2020 and\nKrummel\u2019s introduction to Miki 2024), he did maintain a close\nrelationship with Nishida, with whom he published several dialogues in\nthe 1930s. Not only was Miki one of the former students who inspired\nNishida to take an interest in Marxism during this period, but\nMiki\u2019s own mature philosophical anthropology and philosophy of\nsociety and history remained influenced by Nishida. Indeed, in his\nunfinished magnum opus, The Logic of Imagination (Miki 2024),\nwhile explicitly engaging with the texts of Dewey, Hume, and\nespecially Kant, Miki sets forth the Nishida-inspired idea that a\ncreative \u201cnothingness is what transcends the subjective and the\nobjective and envelopes them\u201d (quoted in Fujita 2011, 315).\n\nAmong Western scholars, John Maraldo has most thoroughly probed the\nquestion of Kyoto School identity and membership. He isolates six\ncriteria that scholars have used to include and exclude thinkers from\nthe Kyoto School: (1) connection with Nishida; (2) association with\nKyoto University; (3) stance toward Japanese and Eastern intellectual\ntraditions; (4) stance toward the interrelated matters of Marxism, the\nnation state, and the Pacific War; (5) stance toward Buddhism and\ntoward religion in general; and (6) stance toward the notion of\nabsolute nothingness. Maraldo shows how each one of these criteria\nhave been used in various ways, consciously or unconsciously, since\nthe 1930s to either promote the philosophical significance or\ndisparage the political ideology of the Kyoto School (Maraldo 2005,\n33\u201338).\n\nI would add two more related and interrelated criteria. One is an\nessentially ambivalent stance (i.e., neither simple rejection\nnor simple acceptance) toward Western philosophy and the West in\ngeneral. For example, Nishida and others undertake a critical\nreception of Western ontology in order to develop an Eastern\nmeontology or \u201clogic of nothingness,\u201d and attempt to\ncombine a Western \u201clogic of things\u201d with an Eastern\n\u201clogic of heart-mind.\u201d I will discuss such issues in\nsection 3 of this article.\n\nAnother criterion that could be used to define the School is an\nessentially ambivalent attitude toward Western modernity (or\ntoward modernization as Westernization). A critical stance toward a\nunilateral globalization of Western modernity, a stance which at the\nsame time accepts in part its unavoidability and in some respects even\naffirms its necessity, was expressed with the idea being discussed at\nthe time of \u201covercoming modernity.\u201dAccording to Kyoto\nSchool philosophers, this overcoming would take place not by\nretreating from Western modernity (as some romantic and conservative\nthinkers asserted), but rather by going through and beyond\nit. This going through and beyond, moreover, would not simply be a\nmatter of going further down the road of linear progress; it would\nentail a hermeneutical as well as ultimately a (me)ontological and\nexistential re-gress, a radical \u201cstep back.\u201d For Kyoto\nSchool philosophers such as Nishitani, a critical and creative\nretrieval of the traditions of East Asia, those of East Asian\nMah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism in particular, is thought to enable the\nradical religious and philosophical \u201ctrans-descendence\u201d\nnecessary to move through and beyond the limits and problems of\nWestern modernity (see Nishitani 2008; Nishitani 1990, 173\u201381;\nDavis 2004).\n\nThis idea of \u201covercoming modernity\u201d has proven to be both\none of the more provocative and controversial aspects of their\nthought. For some it promises to contribute an important East Asian\nperspective to debates over postmodernism in philosophy and\npostcolonialism in culture studies. Yet because the Kyoto\nSchool\u2019s ideas of \u201covercoming modernity\u201d developed\nin conjunction with their wartime political theories, theories which\ntypically saw the nation of Japan as playing a key role in the\nhistorical movement through and beyond Western modernity, it has also\nproven to be one of the most criticized aspects of their thought. (It\nis noteworthy in this regard that many postwar Japanese proponents of\n[Western] postmodernism eschewed making the connection between their\nadoption of recent Western self-criticism of modernity/Eurocentrism\nand the Kyoto School\u2019s earlier critique of these. A noteworthy\nexceptions is Nakamura Y\u016bjir\u014d, and the neo-Marxist\nphenomenologist Hiromatsu Wataru also surprised Japanese academia by\nreviving interest in this aspect of the Kyoto School\u2019s legacy.)\nIn any case, it is true that even after the Kyoto School ceased\nformulating the idea of overcoming modernity in political terms,\nelements of the idea live on in their postwar philosophies of religion\nand culture. Hence, a radical problematization of Western modernity\ncan be considered an important aspect of their identity as a school of\nthought.\n\nAnother significant Western contributor to the question of the Kyoto\nSchool\u2019s identity is James Heisig, who succeeded Jan Van Bragt\nas the head of the Nanzan Institute for Religion and Culture in\nNagoya, an institute which has for several decades now been at the\ncenter of international research on the Kyoto School. In his book,\nPhilosophers of Nothingness: An Essay on the Kyoto School,\nHeisig suggests that we follow the lead of Takeuchi Yoshinori\n(1913\u20132002) and define the School by \u201ctriangulating\u201d\nit around the three leading figures of Nishida, Tanabe, and Nishitani\n(Heisig 2001, 3\u20137 and 275\u201378).\n\nIt is indeed these three figures that form the core of what has become\nknown as the Kyoto School, and in this article I will accordingly\nfocus my attention primarily on them, as well as at times on Ueda\nShizuteru, the leading figure of the third generation of the School.\nIt should nevertheless be kept in mind that these are only four of a\nmuch wider group of original thinkers, some squarely within and some\nmore or less on the periphery of the Kyoto School.\n",
