    "main_text": "A Second Form of Philosophical Anarchism || The Consent Theory of Political Authority: The Argument from Personal Reasons\n4.5 The Consent Theory of Political Authority: The Argument from Personal Reasons\n\n\nOne argument for consent theory essayed by Simmons asserts that a\nperson ought to be free to act on the basis of personal reasons as\nopposed to impersonal reasons. So even if the state does help each\nperson act more on the basis of impersonal reasons that apply to them\nindependent of the state, a person may refuse, on the basis of personal\nreasons, to accept the directives of the state. And so, it is argued,\nthe state's imposition of duties on the individual may occur only if\nthe individual has consented to the state's authority (Simmons\n2001).\n\n\nThe idea that one can have personal reasons not to obey the commands\nof a reasonably just state is unclear. It might be referring to the\nidea that each person has a kind of personal prerogative that permits\nhim to avoid the demands of morality generally. This idea was proposed\nby critics of utilitarianism as a way to avoid the excessive\ndemandingness of utilitarianism while keeping most of the view intact.\nUtilitarianism supplies exclusively impersonal reasons for action to\nindividuals. These seem to undermine the personal projects and\ninterests of individuals. Some have proposed that utilitarianism be\nmodified to accommodate the projects of individuals by including a\npersonal prerogative to act on the basis of personal reasons. Others\nhave argued that there ought to be a personal prerogative to ignore the\nimpersonal reasons of any set of moral requirements.\n\n\nBut this role for personal reasons does not seem to provide much in\nthe way of defense of the consent theory. One reason for this is that\nthese are reasons to avoid some of the demands of morality. But the\nissue at stake in the justification of authority is whether morality\ndemands obedience or not. If we think of these personal reasons as part\nof the structure of morality, on the other hand, then it would seem\nthat these personal reasons are best protected by a reasonably just\nstate that protects individual freedom. So the response to the claim\nthat individuals have personal reasons to evade the commands of the\nstate seems to fall prey to the same argument that undermines the\nnatural right approach.\n",
