Pornography\n1.1 Why Do Feminists Single Out Pornography?\n\nAnne Eaton argues that pornography shows the subordination of women to\nbe sexually pleasurable and, for this reason, it is more effective\nthan other representational materials in shaping viewers\u2019\nattitudes and desires (Eaton 2007: 680). Pornography engages and\ntrains us to be sexually aroused at images depicting women as social\ninferiors, and thereby reinforces the \u201cmechanisms, norms, and\nmyths\u201d that sustain women\u2019s unequal social status (679).\nEaton acknowledges that not all pornography eroticizes inequality and\nfocuses her critique on \u201cinegalitarian pornography\u201d. She\nhypothesizes that the harms caused by exposure to inegalitarian\npornography range from increasing rates of sex discrimination, sexual\nharassment and assault to degrading the status of women. Eaton\nrecognizes that her causal model requires empirical support, and that\nthe studies needed to confirm or refute it have not yet been done.\nBecause inegalitarian pornography is not the only kind of mass culture\nthat promotes sexist attitudes and behavior, it can be difficult to\nseparate out the effects of sexist materials that are sexually graphic\nfrom those that are not.\n\nIn the early years of the second-wave feminist movement, activists\ncampaigned against all violent and sexist popular media. Carolyn\nBronstein argues that the shift from condemning violent and sexist\nmedia images to condemning only pornography (even nonviolent porn)\ninvolved two main factors. First, radical feminists began to view the\nproliferation of hardcore pornography as part of the wider backlash to\nadvances in women\u2019s equality. The saturation of society with\nPlayboy, Hustler, Deep Throat, adult bookstores, and eventually cable\ntelevision and video pornography in the 1960s and 1970s was\ninterpreted by some activists as an orchestrated campaign to keep\nwomen in their assigned social sphere. Some feminists accused their\nopponents of disseminating uniquely seductive and powerful misogynist\npropaganda that falsely and maliciously depicted women as desiring and\ndeserving of coercive and degrading sexual use. Second, Bronstein\nalleges that, by targeting pornography as the culprit rather than\nsexism in the media, the feminist anti-pornography movement took\nadvantage of the conservative climate of the 1980s. Religious social\nconservatives, in particular, had become increasingly critical of the\nsexual revolution of 1960s, and they saw the growth of the pornography\nindustry as evidence of their country\u2019s cultural shift. The\nconvergence of aims among feminists and some conservatives enabled the\nformer to garner financial support from non-feminist, and even\nanti-feminist organizations (Bronstein 2011: 322).\n\nThe anti-pornography movement\u2019s groundwork culminated in the\ndevelopment of a new approach for restricting pornography, which did\nnot rely on the government\u2019s censorship of obscene speech.\nCatharine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin wrote a model anti-pornography\nordinance, which was soon adopted by the city of Indianapolis with the\nhelp of evangelical Christian organizations (Bronstein 2011: 324). The\nordinance defined pornography as the \u201csexually explicit\nsubordination of women, graphically depicted, through pictures and/or\nwords\u201d, and it allowed potential victims to bring civil lawsuits\nagainst the producers and distributors of materials with the specified\ncontent. In response, many free speech activists organized to\nchallenge this new law, and similar ones proposed in cities around the\ncountry. In 1986, the Supreme Court found the Indianapolis ordinance\nto be unconstitutional and, not long after, the feminist\nanti-pornography movement fell into disarray.\n\nAlthough the second-wave feminist anti-pornography movement has now\nevolved into the third-wave sex-positive feminist movement, a number\nof feminist academics are attempting to revive societal opposition to\npornography (Eaton 2007; Langton 2009; Hornsby 1995; Brison 1998). By\nutilizing the tools of philosophical analysis and empirical social\nscience, feminist academics aim to strengthen the intellectual\nfoundations of the anti-pornography movement. With a better\nunderstanding of the impact of pornography on individuals and society,\nand the psychological and social mechanisms that can explain its\ninfluence, communities can mobilize more effective responses to its\nproduction, distribution, and consumption. Now that the Internet\nenables pornography to reach wider audiences, its impact may be\ngreater than ever.\n\nHelen Longino was one of the first feminist philosophers to articulate\na theory of how pornography harms women. She argued that pornography\nshows men and women taking pleasure in activities that objectify women\nand treat women as less than human. By depicting female subjects as\ndehumanized objects, pornography promotes the idea that women can be\ntreated without moral regard (i.e., raped and subjugated). Longino\nwrites\n\n\nWhat\u2019s wrong with pornography, then, is its degrading and\ndehumanizing portrayal of women, and not its sexual content.\nPornography, by its very nature, requires that women be subordinate to\nmen and mere instruments for the fulfillment of male fantasies\n(Longino 1980: 45)\n\n\nFollowing the philosopher Immanuel Kant, Longino assumes that sex is\nmorally problematic because it is difficult, if not impossible, to\nhave sex without treating another person as a \u201cmere means\u201d\nto our own satisfaction. Sexual desire is irrational and leads us to\nreduce others to their sexual body parts, and thus is objectifying,\ndehumanizing, and degrading. Longino adds a feminist element to Kant\nby arguing that, because men have greater social power than women, men\nare able to use women as instruments to satisfy their sexual ends.\nPornographic depictions of heterosexual sex, then, glorify and promote\nthe immoral and subordinating treatment of women by men.\n\nCatharine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin\u2019s well known analysis of\npornography similarly incorporates a Kantian model of sexual morality\nwith a feminist spin (Shrage 2005). Heterosexual acts are inherently\nviolent to women in that they involve men treating women as\ninterchangeable objects whose integrity and boundaries are not\nrespected. Ordinary heterosexual acts, for Dworkin, involve men\ninvading and occupying women\u2019s bodies (Dworkin 1987).\nPornography, then, is equated with visual evidence and documentation\nof the abuse of particular women, and those who view it collaborate in\ntheir violation. According to MacKinnon, women in patriarchal\nsocieties are not free to refuse sex with men, and therefore their\nparticipation in sex with men is not fully consensual. Sex with\npersons incapable of giving genuine consent, made into a public\nspectacle via pornography, expands the temporal and spatial parameters\nof the crime. When women view pornography they often relive their own\nviolation and public humiliation. Therefore, pornography has the power\nto repeatedly traumatize women and does not merely record a past\nabuse, according to MacKinnon and Dworkin. Adult pornography is\nsimilar to child pornography, which records and amplifies the abuse of\nmolested children. Both allow others to participate in and exploit\nsomeone\u2019s victimization for sadistic pleasure. Moreover,\nMacKinnon contends that adult pornography is a tool that can be used\nto obtain a woman\u2019s cooperation with her abuser, just as child\npornography can with a child. She writes that pornography is used by\nmen \u201cto train women to sexual submission\u201d (MacKinnon 1987:\n188).\n\nMacKinnon also claims that \u201cspecific pornography does directly\ncause some assaults. Some rapes are performed by men with\npaperback books in their pockets\u201d (MacKinnon 1987: 184). And\nbecause \u201cpornography conditions male orgasm to female\nsubordination\u201d (MacKinnon 1987: 190), it indirectly and\nsubconsciously elicits from men controlling sexual behaviors.\nPornography shapes both female and male sexual desire into\nvictim/abuser roles, and represents predatory sexual behaviors as\nnatural forms of sexual and gender expression. Pornography is\ntherefore harmful to men who consume it, as well as to women who have\nsexual contact with men, on and off screen. In MacKinnon\u2019s\nwords, pornography represents\n\n\nsex forced on real women so that it can be sold at a profit to be\nforced on other real women; women\u2019s bodies trussed and maimed\nand raped and made into things to be hurt and obtained and accessed,\nand this presented as the nature of women; the coercion that is\nvisible and the coercion that has become invisible\u2014this and more\nbothers feminists about pornography \u2026 pornography causes\nattitudes and behaviors of violence and discrimination that define the\ntreatment and status of half of the population. (MacKinnon 1987:\n147)\n\n\nFor these reasons, anti-pornography feminists generally hold that\npornography is not simply a sexist nuisance that can be addressed by\ncalls for consumer boycotts and corporate responsibility. Instead,\npornography \u201cnourishes sexism\u201d (Longino 1980: 54) and\ndisrespect for women in ways that eventuate in violations of\nwomen\u2019s basic moral and civil rights.\n\nLongino argues that pornography should not be given the same legal\nprotection as other expressive materials. Along with MacKinnon, she\nproposes that pornography should be restricted, not as a form of\nobscene expression, but as a product that can cause serious injuries\nto women, individually and as a group. Longino contends that liberal\ntoleration of pornography constitutes acceptance of the immoral\ntreatment of women (Longino 1980: 48). MacKinnon and Dworkin take this\nargument a step further and allege that pornography often records acts\nof criminal rape and, therefore, its dissemination further compounds\nthe injuries of such criminal acts (MacKinnon 1987: 128, 148\u201349;\nDworkin 1979: 201). Toleration for pornography disempowers all women\nbecause it perpetuates a climate in which women constantly feel\nthreatened by rape, which makes it impossible for them to exercise the\nformal rights they have won. MacKinnon and Dworkin\u2019s model\nordinance sought to make \u201cpornography actionable as a civil\nrights violation\u201d so that women would have legal recourse when\npornographic materials prevent the exercise of their rights or cause\npersonal injuries (MacKinnon 1993: 22, 121, n. 32). By protecting the\nspeech of pornographers and shielding them from liability, according\nto MacKinnon, the state fails to protect women\u2019s equality and\ncivil rights.\n\nMacKinnon and Dworkin offer only anecdotal empirical support for their\nclaims about the harmfulness of pornography. But their work inspired a\nnumber of social scientists to conduct controlled studies to find more\nempirical support for their claims. Reviewing the social science\nliterature available at the time, Diana Scully writes\n\n\nthe proliferation of cultural products, like pornography, intensifies\nthe quantity and quality of violence in men\u2019s fantasies.\nFurther, particularly when women are depicted as receiving pleasure\nfrom the violence directed at them, pornography trivializes rape and,\nthus, may encourage more men to act on their fantasies. Armed with the\nmyths celebrated in violent pornography, such as women secretly want\nto be raped, men who rape can and do believe that their behavior is\nwithin the normative boundaries of the culture. (Scully 1990: 155)\n\n\nScully\u2019s own research compares the consumption of pornographic\nmaterials by convicted rapists with a control group of felons.\nAlthough she notes some problems with her research design, she\nconcludes that her\n\n\ndata do establish that the majority of convicted rapists were familiar\nwith pornography and that their use of such material was somewhat\ngreater than that of other felons. (Scully 1990: 154)\n\n\nIn their review of pornography research, Neil Malamuth, Tamara\nAddison, and Mary Koss report that\n\n\nThe current findings do suggest that for the majority of American men,\npornography exposure (even at the highest levels assessed here) is not\nassociated with high levels of sexual aggression\u2026But among\nthose at the highest \u201cpredisposing\u201d risk level for sexual\naggression (a little above 7% of the entire sample), those who are\nvery frequent pornography users (about 12% of this high risk group)\nhave sexual aggression levels approximately four times higher than\ntheir counterparts who do not very frequently consume pornography.\n(Malamuth, Addison, and Koss 2000: 85)\n\n\nIn a more recent review of the social science literature, Christopher\nFerguson and Richard Hartley report that\n\n\nEvidence for a causal relationship between exposure to pornography and\nsexual aggression is slim and may, at certain times, have been\nexaggerated by politicians, pressure groups and some social\nscientists. Some of the debate has focused on violent pornography, but\nevidence of any negative effects is inconsistent, and violent\npornography is comparatively rare in the real world. Victimization\nrates for rape in the United States demonstrate an inverse\nrelationship between pornography consumption and rape rates. Data from\nother nations have suggested similar relationships. (Ferguson and\nHartley 2009)\n\n\nAlthough Ferguson and Hartley do not discuss studies that consider\nonly inegalitarian pornography, as Eaton\u2019s work suggests, they\ndiscuss a 2004 study that \u201cfound that pornography protects\nagainst negative attitudes toward women\u201d, and a 2007 study that\n\u201cfound no relationship between pornography consumption and\nnegative attitudes toward women\u201d. However, the 2004 study\nindicates, \u201cpornography consumers may be more prone to\nbenevolent sexism, which involves beliefs that women should be\nprotected from harm\u201d (2009: 326). Contrary to Longino and\nMacKinnon, pornography does not seem to \u201cnourish sexism\u201d\nin its malevolent forms.\n\nDeborah Cameron and Elizabeth Frazer question whether any accounts of\nthe causal properties of pornography are helpful or illuminating. They\nargue that such accounts assume a deterministic model of human\nbehavior, in which men lose control over their behavior and respond\nsomewhat mindlessly to pornographic stimuli (Cameron & Frazer\n2000: 248\u2013251). The idea that men simply imitate what they see\nin pornography, or are conditioned to behave in certain ways through\nexposure to pornography, implies that men are not able to creatively\nand critically interpret pornographic materials. Although some men may\nunthinkingly copy what they see, or may even become\n\u201caddicted\u201d to sexual violence through pornography, these\nmen are the exception, not the rule (Cameron & Frazer 2000: 243).\nBy treating sexual violence as a product of exposure to pornography,\nfeminists promote a view that relieves sexual predators of\nresponsibility for their actions, and blames their actions instead on\nexpressive materials or the pathological conditions they allegedly\ncause. Although causal theories invoking the loss of individual\ncontrol through \u201cimitation\u201d and \u201caddiction\u201d\nmay be useful to defendants in sexual assault and murder cases,\nCameron and Frazer point out that these theories undermine the\nfeminist goal of showing that sexual violence is a function of\ncultural norms and structural inequalities, rather than mental\ndebilitation or disease (Cameron & Frazer 2000: 248). Ironically,\ncausal models may engender social sympathy for the perpetrators of\nsexual violence and make it difficult to punish them (Cameron and\nFrazer 2000: 247). Cameron and Frazer conclude that feminists can be\ncritical of \u201cthe discourses which inform sexual practice\u201d\nand imagine alternative discourses, without promoting problematic\nmodels of human behavior (Cameron & Frazer 2000: 253).\n\nNot all feminist philosophers concur with the feminist critique of\npornography. While agreeing that the content of pornography condones\nthe objectionable treatment of women, Ann Garry was one of the first\nto question whether pornography should be held responsible for\npervasive gender-based violence and discrimination. Garry writes\n\n\nMuch of the research on the effects of pornography indicates that\nany effect it has\u2014positive or negative\u2014is short\nlived. (Garry 1978: 404)\n\n\nGarry also questions whether treating a woman as a sex object is\nalways bad, and suggests that pornography succeeds in harming women,\nin part, because viewers assume that sex is generally harmful to women\n(Garry 1979: 136\u201337; see also Garry 2001). Garry encourages\nfeminists to support the production of non-sexist pornography rather\nthan try to suppress pornographic materials.\n1.2 Do Pornographic Works Silence and Subordinate Women?\n\nMacKinnon and Dworkin\u2019s model ordinance captured the prevailing\nfeminist view that pornography is a form of hate speech against women,\nwhich not only triggers sexual aggression in men but also desensitizes\nothers to the suffering of the victims. MacKinnon writes, \u201cWomen\nwho charge men with sexual abuse are not believed. The pornographic\nview of them is: they want it; they all want it\u201d (MacKinnon\n1987: 191). When they communicate their unwillingness to participate\nin a sexual activity, their interlocutors will infer that they are\nmisreporting their desires. In this way, pornography silences women,\nbecause it reinforces the prejudice that women are dishonest or coy\nwhen they express little or no sexual interest in men who pursue\nsexual contact with them. Similarly, when a juror listens to the\ntestimony of a sexual assault victim, his perception of her sincerity\nwill be skewed by his exposure to pornography (Langton 2009: 297). On\nthis view, pornography is a mechanism that can be wielded to deny\nwomen their equal right to free speech, social respect, and personal\nsecurity, and thus subordinates and silences them.\n\nRae Langton deploys the tools of speech act theory to elaborate\nfurther how pornography silences and subordinates women (Langton 1995:\n215). Langton points out that pornographic words and images, like\nutterances in general, are a form of social action. The literal\ncontent (locutionary force) of a pornographic work includes the\nrepresentation of a particular sex acts, which have the effect\n(perlocutionary force) of arousing some viewers and shaping their\nattitudes toward women. The illocutionary force of a pornographic work\npertains to the social actions performed in depicting sex and women,\nsuch as informing, commanding, entertaining, approving, and so forth.\nFor example, a posted sign with the words \u201cWhites Only\u201d\nperforms the social act of commanding and enforcing racial segregation\nin a context with certain kinds of formal or informal social rules\ninvolving racial status. Similarly, a pornographic work may perform\nthe function of recommending or approving certain sexually predatory\nbehaviors in a context with certain kinds of social rules about the\nstatus and entitlements of the character types shown. The\nillocutionary force of a particular speech act, sign, or expressive\nwork depends on a variety of factors, including the intentions of the\nauthor and the linguistic and social conventions that link words with\nparticular meanings and social practices. A \u201cWhites Only\u201d\nsign placed on a laundry basket performs a different illocutionary act\nthan one placed on a drinking fountain or bus seat. A successful\nspeech act, where an audience gets what a speaker intends to\ncommunicate or do, depends on various historical, legal, and other\nfeatures of the context of use (Saul 2006b; Bianchi 2008; Mikkola\n2008). Langton argues that there are good, though not conclusive,\nreasons to think that the background factors that enable pornographic\ntexts to endorse, recommend, or command hostile acts against women are\nin place. However, she also suggests that the illocutionary force of\npornography may be blocked effectively by the speech acts of its\ncritics, rather than by censorship (Langton 1995: 216).\n\nJennifer Hornsby also deploys speech act theory to explain how\npornography silences women. Hornsby maintains that pornographic\nmaterials reinforce ideas about women that deprive their utterances of\ntheir ordinary illocutionary meaning (Hornsby 1995: 227). For example,\npornographic works may convey the idea that the women whom men find\nsexy are eager to satisfy their sexual appetites, so that when these\nwomen say \u201cno\u201d, their utterance constitutes not an act of\nrefusal but an act of teasing. In this way, pornography reinforces\nsocial codes that allow men to systematically misread and discount\nwomen\u2019s speech. Women may be silenced, then, not by having their\nspeech suppressed but by changes to the background conditions\nnecessary for successful speech acts, such as refusal. If pornography\ninterferes with the ability of women to communicate, then women cannot\ncontest the harm of pornography with more speech, but only by\nsuppressing pornographic materials.\n\nOne implication of the claim that pornography causes men to misread\nwomen\u2019s communicative acts is that it potentially offers a\ndefense to sexual predators who claim they sincerely believed their\nvictims intended to convey something opposite to the ordinary meaning\nof their utterances. Mari Mikkola argues that this worry does not\nundermine Langton\u2019s and Hornsby\u2019s analysis of pornography.\nInstead, this consequence of their account should force us to rethink\nhow much a conviction in a rape case should depend upon the accused\nhaving malicious motives or intentions (Mikkola 2011). Mary Kate\nMcGowan et al. argue that\n\n\neven if consuming pornography causes some men to believe that women\nare consenting (when they are not), this is insufficient to show that\nthese beliefs are reasonable. Mere belief in consent does nothing to\nundermine a rapist\u2019s responsibility (in most jurisdictions\nanyway) unless that belief is also reasonable. (McGowan et al. 2011:\n145)\n\n\nYet, if pornography can disable or frustrate ordinary communication,\nhow should reasonable and moral people ensure that their sexual acts\nare consensual? Campaigns against sexual assault that propose simple\nrules, such as \u201cno means no\u201d and \u201cyes means\nyes\u201d, essentially instruct us to equate the illocutionary force\nof an utterance with its literal meaning during a sexual encounter. If\npornography has the power to rob speech of its ordinary meanings, then\na cautious and reasonable way to secure consent for a sexual act might\nrequire defaulting to literal interpretation, with the implication\nthat those who do not will be subject to criminal charges and\npunishment.\n\nSusan Brison explores the subordination thesis and contends that\npornography is a form of group libel that may undermine the autonomy\nof the target group. By spreading falsehoods about women, pornography\nnarrows the range of social options and opportunities that women have\navailable to them. Members of groups that are socially vilified by\nhate literature have a more difficult journey pursuing their aims or\nattempting to perform particular social roles (Brison 1998). Langton\nargues that, even if pornography is about fantasy and is to be\nunderstood as fictional, it can misinform. According to Langton,\npornography projects the beliefs and fantasies of those who are\nsocially powerful, and because those with less social power may\nconform their behavior to those beliefs, the beliefs become\nself-fulfilling. In this way, pornographic speech harms women by\nchanging the world it appears to describe (Langton 2009: 301\u20139).\nMcGowan similarly argues that pornography functions as \u201can\nerroneous but authoritative judgment about women\u2019s\nnatures\u201d, in the way an umpire\u2019s call establishes the\nfacts about the events of a game (McGowan 2005: 43). Abigail Levin\nclaims that \u201cpornography and hate speech are the voice of\nmajority hegemonic power\u201d and thereby operate to privilege and\nvindicate the interests of the powerful majorities and dominant groups\n(Levin 2009: 371\u20132).\n\nLouise Antony challenges Langton's use of speech act theory to\nexplain the apparent self-verifying nature of pornography. Antony\nargues that a speech act cannot both describe a state of affairs and\nbring that state of affairs into being. Langton's account, Antony\nargues, conflates \"power\" with \"authority,\" and\nwhile pornography may have the power or ability to impact the world,\nit is not vested with the authority to do so. Antony points out that\nauthority comes about through social agreement or conventions, and\npornography does not, in this sense, have the authority of an umpire\n(or the law) to impose its commands or view of reality, though it may\nat times succeed in influencing the beliefs or behavior of viewers\n(Antony 2017; see also Stewart 2019).\n\nNadine Strossen challenges the notion that pornographic works have\nsingular authoritative meanings that are inherently sexist or\nmisogynist. She writes\n\n\nProcensorship feminists may well view a woman\u2019s apparent\nwelcoming of sex with a man as degrading, but this is because of their\nnegative attitudes toward women\u2019s ability to make sexual\nchoices. Other viewers are likely to see such a scene as positive and\nhealthy. (Strossen 1995: 162)\n\n\nFurthermore, according to Strossen\n\n\nAmbiguous and positive interpretations apply to the full range of\nsexual speech, including violent imagery and imagery that might well\nbe labeled \u201csubordinating\u201d or \u201cdegrading,\u201d\nsuch as rape scenes and scenes dramatizing the so-called rape\nmyth\u2014namely that women want to be raped. (Strossen 1995:\n146)\n\n\nTo illustrate that pornographic texts can produce divergent responses,\nStrossen examines opposing reactions to a variety of popular media,\nincluding films that depict rape, controversial images of women in\nmainstream advertisements, and Andrea Dworkin\u2019s own sexually\ngraphic novels. Strossen claims that the effect on some viewers,\nincluding women, may be positive:\n\n\nPornography, including pornographic rape scenes, may serve another,\nintensely political end for women who read or see them: they go\nagainst the grain, thus allowing viewers to express rebellion and\nindividuality. In this sense, too, words or images that literally\ndepict a woman\u2019s powerlessness may well have an empowering\nimpact on female viewers. (Strossen 1995: 174)\n\n\nThe existence of divergent interpretations and responses to\npornographic works challenges the idea that pornography has any\nsingle, harmful impact on the background conditions of communication.\nIn short, pornographic works can invite or provoke viewers to\nchallenge oppressive social norms, rather than merely conform to them.\nAt the very least, such materials make troubling aspects of human\nsexuality available for public debate and critique (Strossen 1995:\n176).\n\nGeorgia Warnke turns the tables on the silencing hypothesis by\nsuggesting that\n\n\nantipornography feminism silences women\u2019s differing sexual\nself-expressions by condemning those with which it disagrees as false\nconsciousness \u2026 [and] by promoting legislation that would\nsuppress materials through which women can discover different views of\nan authentic sexuality and, indeed, different ways of being sexual.\n(Warnke 1999: 124)\n\n\nConsuelo Concepcion argues that antiporn feminism\n\n\nshows little respect for women\u2019s differing sexual practices, be\nthey heterosexual intercourse or lesbian sadomasochism. This form of\nuniversalization denies women sexual agency because it assumes that\nour ideas about sexuality have no legitimacy and would be co-opted by\nthe patriarchy. \u2026 [and it] delegitimates women\u2019s\ndissenting sexual voices; consequently, it can depict our sexualities\nas a form of moral deviance. (Concepcion 1999: 98)\n\n\nIn sum, not all women are traumatized or silenced by pornography. Some\nwomen enjoy pornography as consumers in ways that transgress or defy,\nrather than reinforce, social norms or erroneous beliefs about\nwomen\u2019s nature. Antiporn feminists overlook and marginalize\nunconventional and diverse forms of sexual expression that some women\nenjoy.\n\nAmy Allen critiques feminist debates about pornography for reducing\nthe idea of power to the capacity to subordinate someone or resist\nsubordination. Anti-pornography feminists understand\npornography\u2019s influence only in terms the subordination of women\nby men, and in this way treat all women as victims and overlook the\nforms of social power some women have by virtue of their race,\nnationality, or class. Pro-sex feminists view pornography as a tool\nfor subverting sexual norms, and empowering women by enabling them to\nresist sexual repression and sexist constructions of feminine\nrespectability. Following Foucault, Allen argues that the power to\noppress or resist are interconnected, in that both are shaped by\ncommon understandings of human needs and desires that can be\ncontrolled by others or liberated. Allen writes\n\n\npornography does not have the power to construct our social reality\nthat MacKinnon and Dworkin claim it has, nor do we as individuals have\nthe power to decide to construe pornography as necessarily subversive.\nSuch a transformation of the impact of pornography can be brought\nabout, if at all, only by a collective social movement. (Allen 2001:\n528)\n\n\nOn this view of pornography\u2019s influence, its capacity to uphold\nor subvert dominant social norms is conditioned by a third form of\npower, which is the capacity to act in solidarity with others.\n1.3 Does Pornography Sexually Objectify Women?\n\nAlison Assiter employs Hegel\u2019s dyadic understanding of\ndomination and resistance to critique pornography. She writes\n\n\nthe Master-Slave dialectic seems to capture the relation between\npeople in pornographic eroticism. In much pornography, people, usually\nwomen, become objects for another \u2026 In the case of pornography,\nwhat happens is that the one person becomes a body desired by the\nother, but this is not reciprocated. (Assiter 1988: 65)\n\n\nTo treat someone as merely a body for another\u2019s use, without\nrecognizing that she too is a subject with desires, is to treat\nsomeone as a slave, as a subhuman creature or object, and therefore\nviolates her dignity as a human being. Assiter explains that, for\nHegel\n\n\n\u201cthe Master-Slave dialectic\u201d is a phase in the development\nof world history\u2014in the progression towards freedom of the\n\u201cSpirit\u201d that controls historical change. In fact, the\nrelation is disadvantageous both for the slave and for the master,\n(Assiter 1988: 65)\n\n\nfor neither gains the forms of recognition necessary for\nself-conscious awareness and emotional fulfillment.\n\nHarry Brod argues that pornography harms men individually even while\nit augments men\u2019s collective power (Brod 1992: 158). Brod\napplies Kantian, Hegelian, and Marxist moral concepts and writes\n\n\nThe female is primarily there as a sex object, not sexual subject. Or,\nif she is not completely objectified, since men do want to be desired\nthemselves, hers is at least a subjugated subjectivity. But one needs\nanother independent subject, not an object or a captured subjectivity,\nif one either wants one\u2019s own prowess validated, or if one\nsimply desires human interaction. Men functioning in the pornographic\nmode of male sexuality, in which men dominate women, are denied\nsatisfaction of these human desires. (Brod 1992: 154)\n\n\nOn Brod\u2019s account, pornography enhances men\u2019s political\npower over women, while diminishing the quality of men\u2019s\nintersubjective relationships with women, and thereby contributes to\nthe loss of positive human interaction and self-realization. Brod also\nargues that pornography contributes to the commodification of\nsexuality, which enhances men\u2019s powers as consumers, although\nnot necessarily their genuine autonomy and freedom.\n\nCatharine MacKinnon also utilizes Kant\u2019s moral philosophy to\narticulate the problem with pornography:\n\n\nA person, in one Kantian view, is a free and rational agent whose\nexistence is an end in itself, as opposed to instrumental. In\npornography women exist to the end of male pleasure.\n(MacKinnon 1987: 158)\n\n\nFor MacKinnon, pornography involves men treating women as mere\ninstruments in order to satisfy their sexual desires. Such treatment,\nat best, fails to recognize women as free and equal persons and, at\nworst, dehumanizes women and encourages their victimization. In\nresponse to MacKinnon, Martha Nussbaum questions whether sexual\nobjectification always involves treating someone as a mere means to\nanother\u2019s ends, or whether it only does so in certain contexts\n(Nussbaum 1999: 214).\n\nNussbaum identifies seven distinct kinds of actions that may or may\nnot be part of objectification in any given instance: instrumentality,\ndenial of autonomy, inertness, fungibility, violability, ownership,\nand denial of subjectivity (Nussbaum 1999: 218). Some of these actions\nare always morally problematic, but some of them are acceptable when\nthey are part of a larger relationship involving mutual respect.\nNussbaum writes\n\n\nDenial of autonomy and denial of subjectivity are objectionable if\nthey persist throughout an adult relationship, but as phases in a\nrelationship characterized by mutual regard they can be all right, or\neven quite wonderful \u2026 In a closely related way, it may at\ntimes be splendid to treat the other person as passive, or even inert.\nEmotional penetration of boundaries seems potentially a very valuable\npart of sexual life, and some forms of physical boundary penetration\nalso, though it is less clear which ones these are. Treating as\nfungible is suspect when the person so treated is from a group that\nhas frequently been commodified and used as a tool, or a prize;\nbetween social equals these problems disappear \u2026. (Nussbaum\n1999: 238\u201339)\n\n\nIn other words, some actions in which we enjoy another\u2019s body\nsexually are consistent with recognizing the person so used as an end\nin herself, and do not involve treating her as a mere object in the\nKantian sense. But Nussbaum concludes that most conventional\npornography, such as Playboy, fails to meet the Kantian moral\nstandard, and\n\n\ndepicts a thoroughgoing fungibility and commodification of sex\npartners and, in the process, severs sex from any deep connection with\nself-expression or emotion. (Nussbaum 1999: 234)\n\n\nNussbaum therefore concurs with MacKinnon that mainstream pornography\ntreats women as mere objects or trophies\u2014things that enhance\nmen\u2019s status or are exchangeable on demand for the next\nattractive body.\n\nAlthough Nussbaum is sympathetic to MacKinnon and Dworkin\u2019s\nanalysis of pornography, she offers four reservations in regard to\nordinances aimed at making pornographers legally liable for the\nalleged harms caused by their materials. First, the justification for\nthe ordinance fails to distinguish between moral wrongs that are\nlegally actionable and those that are not. Second, violence against\nwomen has a variety of causes and it is difficult to isolate the\ndistinct contribution of pornography. Third, making authors\nresponsible for the criminal actions that their work may inspire is\nlikely to have a chilling effect on valuable expression. And fourth,\nofficials and courts are likely to misapply such ordinances to\ncontroversial but not harmful speech (Nussbaum 1999: 248\u2013249).\nNussbaum\u2019s critique avoids invoking an unlimited or overly broad\nright to free speech, as she notes that not all speech is protected by\nthe First Amendment (Nussbaum 1999: 247). She also notes that makers\nof other vice-type products, such as tobacco, can be held liable for\nthe damaging effects of their products, and that other Western\ndemocratic countries permit restrictions on hate speech. Nevertheless,\nNussbaum suggests that the harms of pornography can be addressed\nthrough moral dialogue and cultural analysis. Similarly, Langton, who\nis highly sympathetic to MacKinnon\u2019s analysis of pornography,\nsees it as primarily a moral issue and a philosophical problem\nregarding what it means to live a good life (Langton 2009: 24).\n\nLinda LeMoncheck challenges the view that pornography involves\nunacceptable forms of sexual objectification by arguing that the\nsexual fantasies depicted in pornography imply that women\u2019s\nsubjectivities are recognized by the consumers of this material\n(LeMoncheck 1997: 133). The fantasy of overcoming a woman\u2019s will\nassumes that she has a will to overcome (LeMoncheck 1997: 131), and\nthe fantasy that women enjoy being sexually exploited assumes that\nthey have desires that men\u2019s sexual use fulfills (LeMoncheck\n1997: 133). LeMoncheck writes\n\n\nsex work is not merely about treating a woman as an object nor merely\nabout dehumanizing her. Sex work is a complex dialectic between\nsubject and object in which a woman\u2019s dehumanization is\nsuccessful precisely because she is perceived as a person whose will,\nseductiveness, and power is properly subordinate to men. (LeMoncheck\n1997: 134)\n\n\nOn this view, pornographic materials and porn consumers recognize\nwomen\u2019s agency while imagining subduing it. Women are thus\nrecognized as subjects with ends of their own and are not depicted as\nmere subhuman objects. Susan Bordo similarly recognizes that women are\nconstructed as subjects in pornography, but she argues that they are\nsubjects whose agency expresses itself only as a desire to please the\nprojected male viewer. She writes\n\n\nan essential ingredient in porn \u2026 is the depiction of a\nsubjectivity (or personality) that willingly contracts its\npossibilities and pleasure to one\u2014the acceptance and\ngratification of the male \u2026 The woman in porn abdicates her\nwill, her sexual discrimination, her independence, but not to become a\nmute body for the man. (Bordo 1994: 276)\n\n\nFor Bordo, there is a mind inside the pornographic female body, but it\ncommunicates only a limited range of nonthreatening desires, and\ntherefore it exists as a truncated self.\n\nShrage contests the Kantian notion that sex is morally problematic\nbecause it inevitably involves using another as a mere instrument. The\nagency of sexual actors does not have a greater potential to immorally\nobjectify others than the agency of employers, consumers, and numerous\nagents who exploit human capacities to achieve their own ends. Shrage\nargues that the use of others involved in pornography is not immorally\nobjectifying as long as consumers and producers respect the ends of\nthe actors and models employed. These ends include the desire to\neconomically benefit from their sexual attractiveness within the\nconventional boundaries set by various genres of sexual representation\nand entertainment. The relationship between porn stars and consumers\nof their work are market relationships and should be held to the norms\nof those relationships, not the norms of friendships and romance\n(Shrage 2005). Similarly, Patricia Marino argues that respect for\nanother\u2019s autonomy and consent are what is crucial for avoiding\nimmoral sexual objectification, and not whether the sexual use is\nmutual or whether it takes place within an ongoing adult relationship.\nA person avoids treating another as a mere object or instrument if he\nis attentive to whether his partner is giving, tacitly or overtly,\nongoing consent to the type of use and the particular instance of it.\nMoreover, the background conditions must be such that the person who\nis used as a means to another\u2019s ends can be judged to be\nvoluntarily and genuinely consenting. When these criteria are met in a\none-sided commercial or casual exchange, then the instrumental use is\nnot immoral (Marino 2008).\n\nJennifer Saul explores the possible connection between\nobjectification\u2014treating people as things\u2014and\npersonification\u2014treating things as people. Saul critiques\nearlier feminist claims that men\u2019s use of pornographic images\ninvolves treating pieces of paper like women, and therefore involves\nconflating women with inanimate instruments (Saul 2006a, 49\u201350).\nMelinda Vadas, for example, argues that the production of objects that\ncan be used, like women, to satisfy sexual appetites places women and\ntheir pornographic substitutes in a single ontological\ncategory\u2014e.g., the category of entities that can arouse and\nsatisfy sexual desire. This reinforces the sexist idea that all that\nfemale and alluring things, whether persons or not, are sexually\nconsumable without consent, or that is, rapeable (Vadas 2005). Saul\nargues that personification and objectification are only linked in\ntroubling ways if some conditions for morally problematic\nobjectification are already met. Saul draws on Rachel Maines\u2019s\nhistorical work on the development of a device now known as the\npersonal vibrator and contends that women\u2019s use of vibrators to\nachieve sexual pleasure and orgasm represents a form of\npersonification. For some women, vibrators eventually replaced a\nservice that had been provided by doctors (and midwives and spas). Yet\nthis is not a troubling form of personification\u2014one linked to\ntroubling forms of objectification\u2014because doctors are not\nlikely to be confused with sex toys as a result of women\u2019s\nmasturbatory use of vibrating technology. Doctors have other\nacknowledged medical uses, as well as ends of their own. Therefore,\nthe transformation of their historical role in treating sexually\nfrustrated (or \u201chysteric\u201d) women, by both new\nunderstandings of women\u2019s reproductive and sexual health and\nadvancements in vibrator technology, does not contribute to the\noppression of doctors. Saul\u2019s discussion of the possible\nequation of people and things, and the background circumstances that\nmay permit this, is useful for considering some new technological\ndevelopments in pornography. New digital imaging and personal computer\ntechnologies enable users to interact and \u201chave sex\u201d with\nplaymate animations on one\u2019s computer screen. Computer-mediated\ninteractions with digitally-simulated but fictional people can\nsometimes be difficult to distinguish from computer-mediated online\ninteractions with real people. Yet such pornographic possibilities do\nnot necessarily involve morally troubling objectification or\npersonification, as long as the social background conditions require\nus to differentiate flesh and blood, non-virtual humans from passive\nobjects and treat the former as subjects, or as active and autonomous\nagents.\n\nNancy Bauer appeals to Beauvoir\u2019s ideas regarding the social\nconstruction of femininity, and suggests that women are to some degree\nresponsible for self-objectification, and are not mere passive agents\nacted upon by men. Bauer critiques contemporary feminist philosophers,\nsuch as Langton, for failing to illuminate contemporary sexual\ncultures and practices in ways that might lead to genuine\nself-criticism and self-awareness. Philosophical speech, like\npornographic speech, is a form of social action, and Bauer\u2019s\nbook urges feminist philosophers to consider what kinds of social\naction they engage in when they offer technical linguistic analyses of\npornography\u2019s influence (Bauer 2015). Do their communicative\nacts serve as action-guiding social commentary, or as theoretical\nexegeses within the insular world of academic philosophy? Can an\nanalysis of pornography\u2019s causal properties tell us what to do\nwith it, or about it?\n\nAnn Cahill argues that the notion of \u2018objectification\u2019 is\nthe wrong tool for analyzing different forms of sex work. Accounts\nthat rely on this concept construe respect for the subjectivity and\nautonomy of persons as a moral duty, while treating a person as a\nphysical thing or a body is morally impermissible. In this way, such\naccounts privilege the mind over the body, and treat the bodily\ncomponents of the self as less important or dignified. Feminists and\nother moral theorists whose critiques of sex work build on the alleged\nwrongs of objectifying persons cannot \u201cexplain how the\nexperience of being treated as a sexually appealing body can actually\nenhance rather than undermine one\u2019s sense of self\u201d (Cahill\n2014: 842). Cahill proposes that we degrade others when we recognize\nin another subject only those aspects of their subjectivity important\nto ourselves. \u201cDerivatized subjects\u201d are often reduced to\nthe roles they fulfill for another subject (e.g., waiter, mother,\netc.), and are only valued for the traits suitable to these roles.\nDerivatization degrades people not by treating them as a mere body,\nbut by treating people such that their subjective qualities and\nidentities are determined by the needs of others. Cahill contends that\nsex work is problematic when it involves derivatizing sex workers\n(defining them in terms of the demands of their clients), but that sex\nwork does not inherently involve this kind of degradation. She\nsuggests that derivatization is especially morally problematic when it\nreflects and reproduces unjust social privileges.\n1.4 Does Some Pornography Serve Feminist Ends?\n\nSome feminist theorists argue that pornography is about voyeurism, and\nthat some women (and some men) take pleasure in looking at depictions\nof sex. To explore women\u2019s use of pornography, feminist scholars\nhave studied soft-core pornographic genres that are marketed to women,\nsuch as pulp romance fiction (Radway 1991). Some have studied lesbian\npornography to challenge the idea that pornography always involves men\nsubordinating women (Ross 2000). In 1986, a group of feminists\npublished Caught Looking: Feminism, Pornography, and\nCensorship, which argues that feminists have targeted pornography\nout of frustration with their lack of progress in reducing violence\nagainst women. The book showcases a variety of pornographic imagery in\norder to illustrate the types of materials that may be restricted\nunder feminist-supported legal regulations (Duggan, Hunter, &\nVance 1986). In the introduction, Kate Ellis, Barbara O\u2019Dair and\nAbby Tallmer argue that\n\n\nthe feminist movement must not be drawn, in the name of protecting\nwomen, into the practice of censoring \u201cdeviant\u201d sexual\nrepresentation or expression \u2026 Women had to learn, with the\nsupport of other women, to articulate experiences that lay outside the\nproper sphere of the \u201cnice girl,\u201d to acknowledge our\nfantasies, and to be proud of our sexual choices \u2026 We must\nspeak out when we are victims, but also acknowledge what excites us,\nand support women who make their living providing that excitement to\nmen and to ourselves. (Ellis et al. 1986: 6)\n\n\nAnn Snitow advocates recentering feminist sexuality discussions on\n\u201cthe right to demand a sexuality more centered on female\npleasure\u201d, instead of focusing on controlling male sexuality\n(Snitow 1986: 11).\n\nIn Caught Looking, Lisa Duggan, Nan Hunter, and Carole Vance\nquestion the political strategies of anti-pornography feminists. They\nask \u201chow can feminists be entrusting the patriarchal state with\nthe task of legally distinguishing between permissible and\nimpermissible sexual images?\u201d (73). Any non-normative form of\nsexual expression, such as consensual BDSM or lesbian erotica, could\nbe targeted by MacKinnon/Dworkin style ordinances. Gayle Rubin\nelaborates\n\n\nThe scapegoating of pornography will create new problems, new forms of\nlegal and social abuse, and new modes of persecution. A responsible\nand progressive political movement has no business pursuing strategies\nthat will result in witch-hunts. (Rubin 1993: 38)\n\n\nDuggan, Hunter, and Vance provide three further reasons for opposing\nanti-pornography laws:\n\n\nfirst, the sexual images in question do not cause more harm than other\naspects of misogynist culture; second, sexually explicit speech, even\nin male-dominated society, serves positive social functions for women;\nand third, the passage and enforcement of antipornography laws such as\nthose supported in Minneapolis and Indiana are more likely to impede,\nrather than advance, feminist goals. (Duggan Hunter, & Vance 1986:\n80\u201381)\n\n\nDrucilla Cornell criticizes MacKinnon and Dworkin\u2019s model\nordinance for its tendency to enshrine an old stereotype of woman in\nthe law\u2014woman as vulnerable and in need of protection. She\nalleges that the ordinance approach relies on the law to enforce\nsocial norms and thus fails to struggle \u201cbeyond those symbolic\nforms that have been deeply inscribed in and by the structures of\ngender\u201d, as new forms of erotica sometimes do (Cornell 2000a:\n554).\n\nJudith Butler examines the role of fantasy in feminist politics and\nargues for maintaining conditions that permit diverse representations\nof women. Butler writes, \u201cfeminist theory relies on the capacity\nto postulate through fantasy a future that is not yet\u201d (Butler,\nJ. 2000: 487). According to Butler, antipornography feminists\nuncritically assume a representational realist ontology in which\n\u201cdepictions\u201d imitate and can causally disrupt some\npreexisting reality. Butler argues for a more complex understanding of\nthe relation between representations and their referents, focusing on\nhow representations can call into question the ontological status of\nentities and on how \u201cthe real\u201d is produced through social\naction. Curtailing representations will produce new forms of social\naction rather than protect some undisturbed, preferred version of\nreality. In Butler\u2019s words\n\n\ncertain kinds of efforts to restrict practices of representation in\nthe hopes of reigning in the imaginary, controlling the phantasmatic,\nend up reproducing and proliferating the phantasmatic in inadvertent\nways, indeed, in ways that contradict the intended purposes of the\nrestrictions itself. (Butler, J. 2000: 490)\n\n\nButler points out that efforts to censor homoerotic images have led to\ntheir greater production and exposure. She concludes that\n\n\nFeminist theory and politics cannot regulate the representation of\n\u201cwomen\u201d without producing that very\n\u201crepresentation\u201d: and if that is in some sense a\ndiscursive inevitability of representational politics, then the task\nmust be to safeguard the open productivity of those categories,\nwhatever the risk. (Butler, J. 2000: 503)\n\n\nButler concurs with feminists who hold that noxious speech can, in\nmost instances, be addressed through action that involves critical and\nthoughtful speech. For instance, disturbing depictions of \u201creal\nsex\u201d can be contested by insightful commentary and by new kinds\nof erotic imagery. Cornell develops this approach by arguing that\n\u201cPolitical action, not legal action, should be the main mode of\nintervention in the production of pornography\u201d (Cornell\n2000a: 551). By political action, Cornell means that feminists should\nform alliances with feminists in the pornography industry to create\nrepresentations of sexuality that will benefit women. Like Snitow,\nCornell argues that feminist activism should focus \u201con\nunleashing the feminine imaginary, rather than on constraining\nmen\u201d (Cornell 2000a: 553). Cornell examines the film and\nperformance work of Candida Royalle, Ona Zee, and Annie Sprinkle to\nshow how \u201cfemme\u201d and feminist pornography challenges the\nways that conventional pornography captures women and sex. Like\nButler, Cornell emphasizes the importance of fantasy for realizing\ntransformative feminist projects. She writes \u201cWithout new images\nand new words in which to express our sexuality, we will be unable to\ncreate a new world for women\u201d (Cornell 2000a: 564).\n\nAnne Eaton explores the production and marketing of feminist\npornography and argues that, just as conventional pornography shapes\nour erotic tastes in ways that reinforce patriarchal values, it can\nand should be co-opted for feminist purposes. Pornography can be\nproduced so that it eroticizes sexual practices and relationships that\nreflect egalitarian values (Eaton 2017; see also Stewart 2019). Robin\nZheng explores the work of women of color in the pornography industry,\nand considers the capacity of pornography to both reinforce and resist\nracist stereotypes and aesthetic values. Countering the arguments of\nthose who allege that risks of participating in the porn industry\noutweigh the benefits, Zheng writes \u201cif we must wait until the\npatriarchy is ... dismantled for morally pure sexual pleasures, then\nwe will be allowed no pleasures at all. Moreover, we will not be\nengaged in the sort of experimentation and play\u2014which, to be\nsure, may initially lead to more mistakes than successes\u2014that\nwill ultimately lead to the transformative pornography that feminists\nhave so longed for. While we can certainly critique particular\nelements and works of pornography, pornographies as market industries\nand forms of cultural production will continue to play an important\nrole in facilitating the development and cultivation of the active\nsexual selves that we wish to be\u2026\u201d (Zheng 2017).\n2. Prostitution\n2.1 Should Some Sex Markets Be Prohibited?\n\nMarkets that subvert or erode fundamental moral and political values\nshould be suppressed, according to Debra Satz. These markets tend to\nexploit the social vulnerabilities of others, lack informational\ntransparency, pose unacceptably high risks for some participants, or\ncontribute to the social marginalization of some groups. For example,\nmarkets in sexual services that (i) seek providers from stigmatized or\ndisempowered social classes, (ii) fail to create conditions for\ninformed consent, (iii) damage the health of participants, or (iv)\nreinforce pernicious stereotypes about women or other groups, are of\nquestionable value. Although these features of markets are usually\ncontingent, when they persist, states are justified in restricting or\nregulating such markets, especially if they can do so without\nproducing more harm than good (Satz 2010). Anne Phillips contends that\nmarkets in sexual services arise only under conditions of social\ninequality. She writes, \u201cthe inequality that attends such\nmarkets is not just contingent; it is an intrinsic feature\u201d\n(Phillips 2011: 738). People offer sexual intimacy, or bodily organs\nor substances, primarily as acts of compassion, and do not in ordinary\ncircumstances commoditize such bodily capacities. Phillips points out\nthat few customers in such markets would be willing to enter as\nsellers. Those who do market their sexual, reproductive, or other\nbasic bodily capacities do so only when background circumstance compel\nthem to do so.\n\nCarole Pateman argues that the work of a female prostitute is\ndifferent from other jobs, as it expresses the inferior social and\npolitical status of women. Moreover, because people\u2019s bodies and\nsexual capacities are an integral part of their identity as men and\nwomen, the woman who works as a prostitute sells her womanhood and\ntherefore herself (Pateman 1988: 207). Christine Overall similarly\nargues that prostitution is a transaction in which one person must be\ndefined as a social subordinate who caters to the desires of another.\nShe claims that the prostitute\u2019s work differs from that of other\nlow-status workers in that it is a form of labor that cannot be\nreciprocated (Overall 1992: 718). Elizabeth Anderson develops this\nidea and argues that the good of sex is\n\n\nrealized only when each partner reciprocates the other\u2019s gift\nin kind, offering her own sexuality in the same spirit in\nwhich she received the other\u2019s\u2014as a genuine offering of\nthe self. The commodification of sexual \u201cservices\u201d\ndestroys the kind of reciprocity required to realize human sexuality\nas a shared good,\n\n\nand may corrupt non-market sexual relationships by promoting the\nvaluation of women in terms of their market worth (Anderson 1993:\n154\u201355; see also Radin 1996: 133).\n\nAlthough Phillips, Pateman, Overall, and Anderson regard marketing\none\u2019s sexual capacities as inherently degrading and oppressive,\nother feminist theorists contend that these features of the work are\ncontingent. Shrage argues that sex markets, like other markets, often\nexploit sexist ideas that relegate women to subservient roles, and\ntheir existence in this form can perpetuate pernicious social myths\nthat stigmatize women. Yet, the background conditions of such markets\ncan change, especially as the norms of gender and sexuality evolve in\nways that are less sexist (Shrage 1989: 357). Debra Satz writes\nthat\n\n\nIf prostitution is wrong it is because of its effects on how men\nperceive women and on how women perceive themselves. In our society,\nprostitution represents women as the sexual servants of men. (Satz\n1995: 78)\n\n\nSatz suggests that the negative image of women promoted by\nprostitution \u201cshapes and influences the way women as a whole are\nseen\u201d (Satz 1995: 79). However, if the industry were\nrestructured to be less sexist, then its impact on society would be\ndifferent.\n\nMartha Nussbaum questions whether the sale of sexual services\ngenuinely damages the persons who provide them or women as a whole.\nNussbaum points out that, two centuries ago, the use of one\u2019s\nartistic talents for pay, such as singing or acting, was regarded as a\nform of prostitution (Nussbaum 1999: 277). Nussbaum acknowledges that\nsex workers are currently stigmatized for their profession, but\nquestions whether the stigma that attaches to their work is justified.\nBy tracing this stigma both to aristocratic prejudice toward waged\nlaborers and to moralistic attitudes and anxieties regarding female\nsexual expression, Nussbaum challenges the rational basis of this\nsocial stigma (Nussbaum 1999: 278\u201379, 286\u201388). She\nconcludes that feminists should oppose the stigmatization of sex work,\nrather than oppose sex work for its contribution to the stigmatization\nof women. Nussbaum also questions seven common claims against\nprostitution: that it involves excessive risks, the prostitute has\nlittle autonomy, it violates the prostitute\u2019s bodily integrity,\nprostitution has a destructive effect on non-commercial intimate\nrelationships, prostitution violates a person\u2019s inalienable\nright to her sexuality, it contributes to a male-dominated social\norder, and it relies on the economic coercion of workers. Nussbaum\nargues that the problems associated with prostitution are components\nof many other kinds of work and social practices, and that these\nproblems are not inherent to the work but are often a function of the\nprostitute\u2019s working conditions and treatment by others\n(Nussbaum 1999: 288\u201397, see also Moen 2012).\n\nScott Anderson resists the move to treat prostitution like other forms\nof work. He argues that normalizing prostitution undermines a\nperson\u2019s right to sexual autonomy, which is an important value\ndefended by radical feminists. Prostitutes waive their right to sexual\nautonomy because their jobs place them under contractual obligations\nto have sex, and thus diminish their control over when and with whom\nthey have sex. Anderson acknowledges that all jobs, to some degree,\ndiminish various forms of autonomy. He contends that sexual autonomy\nshould be valued differently from other forms, such as a\nperson\u2019s control over when and to whom they serve food, provide\na massage or dance, offer expert advice, or talk philosophy. He\nwrites\n\n\na person\u2019s sexuality almost always figures prominently as an\naspect of his or her self-conception, status in society, and economic\nand social prospects\u2026It is because sex plays such a pivotal\nrole in the lives of most adults\u2026that it creates its own\nspecial\u2026realm within which one can be more or less autonomous.\n(Anderson 2006: 386)\n\n\nAnderson here echoes Pateman\u2019s contention that our sexual\ncapacities and practices are an integral part of who we are as men and\nwomen. For this reason, a person\u2019s sexual autonomy should be\nnon-alienable, because to alienate it is to destroy a person\u2019s\nwholeness or integrity.\n\nIn response to Anderson, Hallie Liberto distinguishes three ways of\nalienating a right or good. First, one can waive a right to x (in\na weak sense) by granting someone access to x with the\nunderstanding that, at any moment, permission to use x can be\nrevoked. Second, one can waive a right to x (in a strong sense) by\ngranting someone access to x for a duration of time, with the\nunderstanding that permission to use x cannot be revoked during\nthis period (presumably if other terms of the lease are met). Third,\none can relinquish a right to x by transferring that right, as\nthrough a sale or gift. In this case, permission to use x is\ngranted permanently and cannot be revoked if other terms of the\ntransfer are met. Liberto points out that those who consider the\nmarketing of sexual services a legitimate form of work assume that the\nsex worker, like other workers, will only be alienating her right of\ncontrol over her body and sexual labor in a weak sense (Liberto 2009:\n141\u201343; see also Schwarzenbach 1991: 112). In a society in which\nany form of forced labor is prohibited (e.g., slavery, indentured\nservitude), workers are generally permitted to back out of labor\ncontracts, although in doing so they typically relinquish all expected\nbenefits (Shrage 2016).\n\nSex worker activists and advocates have long argued that they are not\npermanently alienating (selling) their sexual capacities, but rather\nare exchanging sexual labor for benefits (Schwarzenbach 1991:\n112\u201314). A sex worker\u2019s right to sexual autonomy is not\nundermined in contexts where she retains the right to withdraw from\nher labor contracts at any time (Tuana and Shrage 2003: 33; Shrage\n2016). Carol Leigh and Norma Jean Almodovar suggest that\nanti-prostitution laws undermine sexual autonomy by not allowing\nadults to enter mutually advantageous sexual agreements (Leigh 2004;\nAlmodovar 2002). Peter de Marneffe argues for limiting sex worker\ncontracts in ways similar to other forms of dangerous and potentially\nharmful work. Restricting and regulating prostitution would balance\nrespect for the autonomy of service providers (and consumers of sexual\nservices) with society\u2019s interest in protecting its members from\nharm (de Marneffe 2010).\n2.2 Can We Distinguish Human Trafficking from Consensual Sex Work?\n\nSome markets in sexual services exploit providers who manifest weak\nagency (Satz 2010), such as people who are young, homeless, drug\naddicts, poor, oppressed minorities, migrants, undocumented, and so\non. Gerda Lerna argues that to understand how prostitution evolved\nhistorically, we need to understand \u201cits relationship to the\nsexual regulation of all women in archaic states and its relationship\nto the enslavement of females\u201d (Lerner 1986: 124). Lerner\nwrites\n\n\nIt is likely that commercial prostitution derived directly from the\nenslavement of women and the consolidation and formation of classes.\nMilitary conquest led, in the third millennium B.C., to the\nenslavement and sexual abuse of captive women. As slavery became an\nestablished institution, slave-owners rented out their female slaves\nas prostitutes, and some masters set up commercial brothels staffed by\nslaves. (Lerner 1986: 133)\n\n\nLerner speculates that prostitutes and concubines were used by rulers\nas symbols of wealth and power, and this practice was then emulated by\nother men of wealth and status (Lerner 1986: 133). Paupers were often\nforced to sell children, adding to the supply of labor for this\npurpose. Furthermore, as women\u2019s social respectability and\nmarriageability became tied to their chastity, \u201ccommercial\nprostitution came to be seen as a social necessity for meeting the\nsexual needs of men\u201d, (Lerner 1986: 134). In short, women who\nbecame prostitutes in ancient societies were typically enslaved,\ncaptive, or poor.\n\nGayle Rubin traces the origins of modern prostitution to the rise of\npatriarchal kinship systems in which women are exchanged as gifts\namong families to cement social bonds (Rubin 1975: 175). Rubin\nwrites\n\n\nIf women are the gifts, then it is men who are the exchange partners.\nAnd it is the partners, not the presents, upon whom reciprocal\nexchange confers its quasi-mystical power of social linkage. The\nrelations of such a system are such that women are in no position to\nrealize the benefits of their own circulation. As long as the\nrelations specify that men exchange women, it is men who are the\nbeneficiaries of the product of such exchanges\u2014social\norganization. (Rubin 1975: 174)\n\n\nIn other words, in the very creation of society, women were allegedly\nsubordinated through ritual exchange in order to create bonds of\nkinship among men as the foundation of the social order. Rubin\nwrites\n\n\nThe \u201cexchange of women\u201d is a seductive and powerful\nconcept. It is attractive in that it places the oppression of women\nwithin social systems, rather than biology. Moreover, it suggests that\nwe look for the ultimate locus of women\u2019s oppression within the\ntraffic in women, rather than within the traffic in merchandise.\n(Rubin 1975: 175)\n\n\nTrafficking in women to create social bonds among men, on\nRubin\u2019s account, explains women\u2019s social subordination as\nwives and ultimately, and as nonfamilial sexual servants.\n\nBoth Lerner\u2019s and Rubin\u2019s accounts link the rise of\nprostitution to the subordination of women, and overlook the\nenslavement and prostitution of men, both in ancient and modern\nsocieties. Lerner\u2019s account fails to explain why female slaves\nwere sexually exploited more than male slaves. Rubin does not explain\nwhy women, rather than men or opposite-sex pairs, were exchanged or\n\u201ctrafficked\u201d in early kinship systems, and thus her\naccount begs the question in regard to the rise of patriarchal kinship\nand political systems (Shrage 1994: 105, 131\u201332). While\nconsumers of commercial sexual services have been predominantly male\nthroughout history, factors other than gender subordination have\ninfluenced whose sexual labor was bartered or sold, such as\ncolonialism and racial subordination (Kempadoo 1999). By trying to\nexplain contemporary sex commerce in terms of the subordination of\nwomen, these accounts overlook important historical and cultural\ndiscontinuities. For example, commercial sex providers have not always\nbeen regarded as ineligible for marriage and have, in some places,\nbeen integrated into their communities to a high degree (Shrage 1994:\n109, 115; White 1990: 19; Rossiaud 1988: 70).\n\nCarol Pateman deploys the concepts of liberal political theory to\nexplain the existence of prostitution in modern societies. She argues\nthat the social contract, which establishes the rights and freedoms of\nmen in a liberal political order, also establishes the terms of\nwomen\u2019s subjection. In particular, the patriarchal social order\nincludes an implicit agreement among men that grants them sexual\naccess to women (Pateman 1988: 2). Men acquire sexual rights to\nparticular women through marriage and prostitution. In other words,\nmen have a class privilege\u2014a right to sexual relief from\nwomen\u2014which they can exercise by asserting their rights as\nhusbands or johns. Like Lerner and Rubin, Pateman challenges the\nnotion that prostitution results from men\u2019s biologically driven\nbehavior, and instead explains prostitution as the incorporation of a\nparticular conception of masculinity into modern political and social\nstructures (Pateman 1988: 198\u201399). In this way, modern\nprostitution represents the survival of some aspects of older\nilliberal social orders within the modern liberal state. Both\ntraditional marriage and prostitution, for Pateman, Lerner, and Rubin,\ngive men access to and control over the sexual capacities of\nwomen.\n\nKamala Kempadoo argues that \u201cthe global sex trade cannot be\nsimply reduced to one monolithic explanation of violence to\nwomen\u201d (Kempadoo 2001: 28). Kempadoo claims that older feminist\nmodels, which see prostitution as reflection of male power backed up\nby a monopoly on the use of physical force, are \u201cinadequate to\ncapture the various histories, oppression, and experiences of women of\ncolor\u201d (Kempadoo 2001: 35, 37). Kempadoo examines how histories\nof racism, colonialism, militarism, and globalization structure the\nchoices of first and third-world women of color. Although Kempadoo\nurges feminists to understand prostitution in terms of a broader range\nof social forces, she maintains that feminist theorizing about\nprostitution should avoid overlooking the agency of women of color by\ntreating them as mere passive victims of oppression (Kempadoo 2001:\n43). Kempadoo writes\n\n\nThe agency of Brown and Black women in prostitution has been avoided\nor overlooked and the perspectives arising from these experiences\nmarginalized in dominant theoretical discourse on the global sex trade\nand prostitution. Our insights, knowledges, and understanding of sex\nwork have been largely obscured or dominated by white radical\nfeminist, neo-Marxist or Western socialist feminist inspired analyses\nthat have been either incapable or unwilling to address the\ncomplexities of the lives of women of color. (Kempadoo 2001: 40)\n\n\nRather than conceptualize prostitution in terms of the sexual\nexploitation and degradation of women, Kempadoo advocates\nunderstanding prostitution as a kind of labor that is often performed\nby marginalized people (Kempadoo 2001: 45; Kempadoo and Doezema 1998:\n4\u20135; see also Leigh 1997). In this way, prostitution is similar\nto labor performed in other industries, such as agriculture,\nmanufacturing, or transportation. By analyzing prostitution as a form\nof labor, rather than a form of social decay or evil, feminists can\navoid unrealistic abolitionist approaches (Kempadoo and Doezema 1998;\nWhite 1990; Shrage 1996).\n\nA number of feminist theorists analyze prostitution and trafficking in\nterms of neoliberal and neocolonial economic relationships, in which\nwomen from poor countries in the global south are conscripted to\nprovide \u201ccomfort and recreation\u201d for military personnel\nand other men from rich nations in the global north. Sometimes social\nelites in poor nations tolerate and promote their own \u201csex\ntourism\u201d enterprises, in which local women provide sexual labor\nto attract foreign capital (Enloe 1989: 36, 86; O\u2019Connell\nDavidson 1998: 75; Bishop and Robinson 1998). Laura Agust\u00edn\ncautions feminists not to conflate voluntary (though illegal) migrants\nwho are seeking more lucrative forms of sex work with trafficked women\n(Agust\u00edn 2007). Although poor, third-world (and second-world)\nwomen are often exploited by traffickers, some may be choosing to\nmigrate and work in sex businesses over other occupations available to\nthem (factory or domestic work) both in their home and target\ncountries. Harsh laws against trafficking often exacerbate the plight\nof voluntary migrant sex workers who may be undocumented and working\nillegally (Kotiswaran 2011; Rajan 2003; Kempadoo and Doezema 1998).\nAnti-trafficking and anti-prostitution efforts should focus on\neliminating forced work and migration, child labor, exploitative\nworking conditions, and hostile legal environments for migrants and\nsex workers (Kotiswaran 2011: 47\u20138).\n\nBecause sex workers often come from marginalized social groups, their\nbasic rights as workers and citizens are frequently violated (Butler,\nC. 2015). Feminist theorists who recognize sex work as a legitimate\nchoice that some people make, among a constricted set of opportunities\nin order to earn a living, also recognize that sex markets can take\nmany forms. In some cases those who supply the labor are relatively\nfree and empowered agents, and in other cases they are not. The\nchallenge is to devise policies that prevent the recruitment of\nchildren and socially vulnerable people as providers, and that also\nprotect the rights of those who enter such markets even with informed\nconsent.\n2.3 Can Markets in Sexual Services Be Effectively Regulated?\n\nTrafficking in persons (human slavery) for any purpose, including sex\ncommerce, is universally condemned and rightly so. Feminists disagree\nabout whether all sex markets involve forced labor and sex. Those who\nregard commerce in sex categorically as a form of involuntary\nservitude and violence against women generally support laws that\npunish people who exchange money for sex in all circumstances\n(Jeffreys 1998; Barry 1996; Stark and Whisnant 2004). Feminists who\nhold that some sex work is performed by people who exert autonomy and\nmoral agency generally support policies that permit exchanges of sex\nfor money among consenting adults (Shrage 1996; Nussbaum 1999; Ditmore\n2005; Leigh 2004). Having such policies is consistent with vigorous\nefforts to stop human trafficking.\n\nPeter de Marneffe distinguishes four approaches to laws governing\nprostitution. (1) Prohibition involves criminalizing both the\nsale and purchase of sexual services, along with related activities,\nsuch as soliciting or operating a brothel. (2) Abolition\ninvolves criminalizing only the purchase of sexual services, along\nwith related activities such as curb (\u201ckerb\u201d) crawling or\nprocuring. (3) Regulation (legalization) involves\ngovernmental licensing and regulating of sex work businesses. (4)\nDecriminalization involves removing criminal prohibitions for\nacts of purchasing or selling sex among consenting adults (de Marneffe\n2010: 28\u201330; see also Kotiswaran 2011: 16). According to de\nMarneffe, one can defend decriminalization by appealing to the moral\nright to self-sovereignty, without supporting legalization, especially\nof large scale enterprises (de Marneffe 2013).\n\nMost feminists who oppose all sex commerce support abolition rather\nthan prohibition, because the abolition approach treats the provider\nof sexual services as a victim rather than a criminal. To prosecute\nwomen for selling sex, some argue, just compounds their victimization\nand oppression. Sweden was the first country to adopt this approach\n(Watson 2019). Other feminists support regulation, because abolition\ncan endanger sex workers by forcing their work underground in order to\nprotect customers. The Netherlands and Germany have adopted some form\nof regulation, which basically aims to reduce the harms of\nprostitution rather than eliminate it. Some feminists support\ndecriminalization (the approach now taken in New Zealand) because most\nregulatory approaches (e.g., mandatory registration and health checks\nfor providers, restricting work sites through zoning and brothels,\netc.) aim to protect customers and third parties, not sex workers, and\ncontribute to the stigmatization of prostitutes as diseased and sinful\n(Nagle 1997; Kempadoo and Doezema 1998; Almodovar 2002; Leigh 2004).\nBy contrast, regulationists worry that a laissez-faire\napproach leaves sex workers vulnerable to extreme exploitation, and\nsome explore how employment law and policy can protect sex workers, as\nwell as clients and third parties (Davis 2015; Shrage 1994 and\n1996).\n\nIn the U.S., many sexual service providers work for escort agencies,\nand thereby manage to get around anti-prostitution laws. Because the\nclient pays the agency for the escort\u2019s time and the provider\ndoes not take money directly from the client but only from the agency,\nsex between a professional escort and her client is often ignored by\nlaw enforcers. When agencies become aggressive and brazen in their\nadvertising or business practices, they are sometimes prosecuted as\nfronts for prostitution. Yet, the full force of anti-prostitution laws\ntends to be felt by women who are destitute, drug-addicted, or just\namateurs, who solicit customers directly or in public places. Under\nregimes of prohibition, anti-prostitution laws are often used against\npeople who engage in survival sex, such as homeless women or minors\nwho are not able to work in safer venues. Rarely are they used against\nmiddle class women who serially date men in pursuit of expensive\ngifts, college tuition, or living expenses (Shrage 2015).\nAnti-prostitution laws are also used to prosecute men who sexually and\ncommercially exploit women (e.g., customers and pimps), but they are\nsometimes used to prosecute the boyfriends and co-workers of\nprostitutes with whom they have consensual and supportive\nrelationships (Almodovar 1993). Police practices in the U.S.,\nhistorically, have focused on arresting and prosecuting prostitutes,\nespecially street workers, who may receive enhanced penalties if they\nknow they are HIV positive. Women make up the majority of prostitutes\nand the majority of those arrested, and minority women are\noverrepresented among those arrested (Marganski 2012).\n\nOver the past few decades, a few countries have moved toward\ntoleration and regulation of the work activities of prostitutes, yet\nthe larger trend has been toward criminalization, often with increased\npenalties for customers and pimps (see\n 100 Countries and Their Prostitution Policies).\n Feminist campaigns against prostitution and trafficking have\nmobilized to win approval for abolitionist policies. Essentially, the\nfeminist anti-pornography movement of the 1970s and 1980s has evolved\ninto the feminist anti-trafficking movement of the 21st\ncentury. Both movements treat markets in sexually explicit materials\nand services as a form of violence against women, and claim that\ntolerating them perpetuates the social subordination of women. Like\nthe anti-pornography movement in the 1980s, the anti-trafficking\nmovement is finding common ground with social conservatives who have\nreligious objections to non-marital sex, and, more recently, with\npolitical conservatives who want to keep economic migrants out of\ntheir countries.\n\nIn response to these and earlier efforts to block sex markets, an\ninternational sex workers\u2019 rights movement has formed to\nadvocate for decriminalizing consensual adult sex work. Sex worker\nactivists, many of whom are also feminists, have challenged scholarly\nresearch about their lives and work, and argue that criminalization\nrenders them less able to protect their health and exercise their\nrights (Almodovar 1993; Pendleton 1997; Highleyman 1997; Queen 1997;\nSprinkle 1998; Quan 2001; Bernstein 2000; Leigh 2004). Sex worker\norganizations are forming alliances with queer activists, labor\nunions, and human rights advocates to advance their political goals\n(Beloso 2012). In 2015, an influential human rights organization,\nAmnesty International, approved a resolution calling upon countries to\ndecriminalize adult consensual sex work, which represents a huge\nvictory for the sex workers rights movement.\n\nAdrienne Davis argues that the abolitionist movement has had more\npolitical victories because this side is more united in their aims. By\ncontrast, feminists supporting sex worker rights are deeply divided\nover whether to support regulation or decriminalization. Davis shows\nthat advocates for regulation exaggerate the similarities of sex work\nwith other types of work, while advocates for decriminalization\nexaggerate the differences. Davis proposes a \u201csexual\ngeographies\u201d approach to sex work, which recognizes that the\npotential harms depend on where and how the work is performed. Virtual\nsex work, where providers are relatively anonymous and meet with\ncustomers only online, is relatively safe. Outcall work, where sex\nworkers meet with customers in private spaces, such as hotel rooms,\nand have physical contact with their customers is significantly more\nrisky. Exotic dancers, who perform in public venues, such as bars and\nclubs, and have limited physical contact with customers, face an\nintermediate level of risk. Health and safety regulations need to\nencompass different kinds of work sites and risks, and include\nappropriate measures for each.\n\nDavis notes where current employment law in the U.S. is insufficient\nto address some of the risks that sex workers face, such as assault by\ncustomers and co-workers and invidious discrimination (Davis 2015).\nEmployment regulations typically offer greater protection for injuries\nacquired in the course of doing one\u2019s job than for incidental\nviolence and attacks. Davis also points out that sexual harassment\nwill be more difficult to define in sex work contexts. Furthermore,\nbecause preferences for race, like gender, may be built into\ncustomers\u2019 sexual tastes and fantasies, employers and courts\nmight view generally irrelevant personal characteristics as bona\nfide occupational qualifications. Nevertheless, Davis favors\ndecriminalization with regulation, and challenges feminists to improve\nemployment regulation so that there are better safeguards for sex\nwork, and other work performed in non-traditional and diverse work\nsites.\n\nIn her theoretically nuanced and fair-minded overview of both radical\nfeminist opposition to prostitution and liberal feminist advocacy of\nsex worker rights, Prabha Kotiswaran carves out a \u201cmiddle\nground\u201d feminist position. Middle ground feminism pays attention\nto the empirical realities of various sex trades and the efforts of\nsex worker organizations to protect the civil and economic rights of\ntheir members. Middle ground feminists are aware of how the sex\nindustry is gendered and, at times, critically and respectfully engage\nwith the proposals of sex worker advocates. For example, they may be\nskeptical of the alleged needs of men that the sex industry aims to\nserve, while recognizing that sex workers are not passive dupes but\nagents who exploit less than ideal background conditions. Middle\nground feminists do not treat sex commerce as monolithic, but pay\nattention to the different ways that labor and capital are organized\nin different trades. They recognize that much of sex work, like other\nlow status service work, is menial and sometimes unpleasant, but it is\nnot work that is inherently degrading or violent to those who\nvoluntarily perform it. They also recognize that sex work is\ncontinuous with much of the caregiving work women perform, as wives,\nmothers, nurses, teachers, nannies, and domestics, and do not single\nout the sex industry for assigning to women a disproportionate share\nof caregiving work in society. In this way, they do not treat sex work\nas exceptional in terms of its risks, difficulty, and larger societal\neffects. And finally, middle ground feminists are less likely to make\ncommon cause with anti-feminist sexual moralists and anti-immigrant\nconservatives, and are more likely to find common cause with unions of\nsex workers that are grappling with challenging working conditions and\neconomic realities (Kotiswaran 2011).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Works Cited", "Other Important Works"], "cat_ref_text": {"Works Cited": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Agust\u00edn, L., 2007, <em>Sex at the Margins: Migration,\nLabour Markets, and the Rescue Industry</em>, London: Zed Books.", "Allen, A., 2001, \u201cPornography and Power\u201d, <em>Journal\nof Social Philosophy</em>, 32: 512\u201331.", "Almodovar, N.J., 1993, <em>From Cop to Call Girl: Why I Left the\nLAPD to Make an Honest Living as a Beverly Hills Prostitute</em>, New\nYork: Simon and Schuster.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2002, \u201cFor Their Own Good: The\nResults of the Prostitution Laws as Enforced by Cops, Politicians, and\nJudges\u201d, in <em>Liberty for Women</em>, W.
