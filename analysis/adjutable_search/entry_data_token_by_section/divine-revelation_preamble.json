    "main_text": "\n\n\u201cRevelation\u201d (lat. revelatio) is a translation of\nthe Greek word apokalypsis, which means the removal of a veil\nso that something can be seen. Many religions appeal to purported\ndivine revelations in order to explain and justify their\ncharacteristic beliefs about God, and revelation has usually been\nunderstood as an epistemic\n notion.[1]\n Paradigmatically, it refers to alleged instances of divine speaking\nor special divine acts in history, although in a more general sense\n\u201crevelation\u201d can denote any means of divine\nself-disclosure, for example through nature. The topic of divine\nrevelation has been a long-standing and central focus in theology, and\nphilosophical discussions have often taken their cues from Christian\ntheological\n debates.[2]\n This entry will treat theological perspectives only in so far as they\nare relevant for philosophical questions about the purported nature\nand means of divine revelation and the justification of revelatory\nclaims. \n",
