    "main_text": "\n\nNativism and Empiricism are rival approaches to questions about the\norigins of knowledge.  Roughly speaking, Nativists hold that important\nelements of our understanding of the world are innate, that they are\npart of our initial condition, and thus do not have to be learned from\nexperience.  Empiricists deny this, claiming that all knowledge is\nbased in experience.  Different Nativist and Empiricist views spell\nout the details in different ways, depending on which elements of our\nknowledge are at issue, what counts as understanding, what is meant by\nthe initial condition, how learning is to be understood, what it is\nfor knowledge to be based in experience, and so on.  There continues\nto be lively philosophical debate about whether there is any\nsatisfactory general account of what it is for something to be innate\n(for a review of some recent work see Gross & Rey 2012).  The\nNativist views discussed here differ in many respects, but all share\nthe broad commitments of the approach.  It should be noted that the\ncommonplace opposition of Empiricism to Rationalism reflects back on\n17th and 18th century philosophical debates in which Nativism was a\ncentral plank in the Rationalist position.  The contemporary Nativist\nviews we consider here are independent of most of the broader Rationalist\ncommitments (see the entry on \n rationalism vs. empiricism), but we note some important and often-ignored connections in section 3.3 of this entry. \n Although it is misleading, it is not uncommon for the\nterms \u2018Nativism\u2019 and \u2018Rationalism\u2019 to be used\ninterchangeably (see the entry on the\n  historical controversies surrounding innateness).\n\nUp until the 1950s, there were no active research programs that were\nlooking for the innate factors in knowledge and cognition that had\nbeen hypothesized and argued for by Nativist thinkers since Plato. It\nwas widely agreed that the centuries-old battles between Empiricists\nand Nativists were over, and that the Empiricists had decisively won.\nThe Nativist situation was actually worse than that: innateness claims\nwere seen as not only wrong, but as ultimately unscientific approaches\nto mind and perhaps incoherent as well.  The prevailing research\nagenda for scientists and philosophers interested in how the mind\nworks was to show how our knowledge and abilities could be fully\naccounted for on the basis of our sensory experiences and the general\nlearning mechanisms that operate on them. \n\nBut a number of developments have led to a resurgence of Nativism,\nbeginning with Chomsky\u2019s revolutionary work in linguistics in the\n1950s and 1960s.  This entry places this resurgence in its scientific\nand philosophical context, and will discuss a few important areas of\nresearch to give a taste of the kinds of experimental approaches,\nhypotheses, and theories that have been advanced. A word about the\nfocus of this entry. Most philosophical discussions about innateness\nbegin with careful analyses of the variety of meanings innateness\nclaims can have, consider the sorts of entities that might be at issue\nin such claims (beliefs, ideas, concepts, knowledge, etc.), discuss\nthe epistemological standing of these innate elements, and so\non. These questions are no doubt interesting\u2014and sometimes the\nanswers are interesting too\u2014and such work has its place. But the\nreal action for philosophers is more in the details of the current\nempirical research, and less in the philosophical bookkeeping.\nCognitive scientists are beginning to reveal some of the basic, or one\nmight say \u2018primal\u2019, patterns of human cognition. They are\nusing experimental evidence to paint a detailed picture of how we\nhuman beings understand the world\u2014both the physical world around\nus, and ourselves and other selves that are parts of that\nworld. Developmental scientists are trying to figure out to what\nextent and in what ways we are built by nature to arrive at these\nunderstandings. Those we identify as Nativists accord a significant\nrole to our natures, and lean towards the view that we are not built\nto be initially neutral about the world we encounter, in the way that\nclassical Empiricism would lead us to expect. This growing body of\nscientific thinking is of general interest, as evidenced by the\nattention of science magazines and newspapers like the NY Times. But\nthe character of our primal understandings and their innate bases are\nintimately connected to the central concepts and questions that\nphilosophers have always been most interested in. Getting clear on how\nwe naturally think and how we come to think that way is, arguably, a\ncritical element in our understanding of human beings.\n\n\nThe entry has three main sections. In the first section,\ncurrent Nativist developments are put in recent historical context,\nespecially the connections between Chomsky\u2019s linguistic\ninnovations and current cognitive science research. The second,\nand longest section, takes up three areas of current research on\nchildren\u2019s early concepts and understanding\u2014of physical\nobjects, number, and mind/agency\u2014to give a sense of the type of\nempirical work being conducted and to highlight some of the promising\nresults that are\n emerging.[1]\nA third section reviews some recent work in\nthe study of development that is close to the Empiricist side of the\ntraditional divide.\n",
