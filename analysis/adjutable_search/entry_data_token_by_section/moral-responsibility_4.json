    "main_text": "Some Approaches to Moral Responsibility || Reasons-Responsiveness Views\n2.3 Reasons-Responsiveness Views\n\nAs noted in\n \u00a71,\n one of the lasting influences of Harry Frankfurt\u2019s defense of\ncompatibilism was to draw attention to the actual causes of\nagents\u2019 behavior, and particularly to whether an\nagent\u2014even a causally determined agent\u2014acted for her own\nreasons. Reasons-responsiveness approaches to responsibility have been\nparticularly attentive to these issues. These approaches ground\nresponsibility by reference to agents\u2019 capacities for being\nappropriately sensitive to the rational considerations that bear on\ntheir actions. Interpreted broadly, reasons-responsiveness approaches\ninclude a diverse collection of views, such as David Brink and Dana\nNelkin (2013), John M. Fischer and Mark Ravizza (1998), Ishtiyaque\nHaji (1998), Michael McKenna (2013), Dana Nelkin (2011), Carolina\nSartorio (2016), R. Jay Wallace (1996), and Susan Wolf (1990). Fischer\nand Ravizza\u2019s Responsibility and Control (1998), which\nbuilds on Fischer (1994), offers the most influential articulation of\nthe reasons-responsiveness approach.\n\nFischer and Ravizza begin with a distinction between regulative\ncontrol and guidance control. Regulative control involves the\npossession of a dual power: \u201cthe power freely to do some act\nA, and the power freely to do something else instead\u201d\n(1998: 31). Guidance control, on the other hand, does not require\naccess to alternatives: it is manifested when an agent guides her\nbehavior in a particular direction (and regardless of whether it was\nopen to her to guide her behavior in a different direction). Since\nFischer and Ravizza take Frankfurt cases\n (\u00a71)\n to show that access to behavioral alternatives is not necessary for\nmoral responsibility, they conclude that \u201cthe sort of control\nnecessarily associated with moral responsibility for action is\nguidance control\u201d and not regulative control (1998: 33;\nemphasis in original).\n\nA number of factors can undermine guidance control. If a\nperson\u2019s behavior is brought about by hypnosis, brainwashing, or\ngenuinely irresistible urges, then that person may not be morally\nresponsible for her behavior since she does not reflectively guide it\nin the way required for responsibility (Fischer & Ravizza 1998:\n35). More specifically, an agent in the above circumstances is not\nlikely to be responsible because he \u201cis not responsive to\nreasons\u2014his behavior would be the same, no matter what reasons\nthere were\u201d (1998: 37). Thus, Fischer and Ravizza characterize\npossession of guidance control as (partially) dependent on\nresponsiveness to reasons. In particular, guidance control depends on\nwhether the psychological mechanism that issues in an\nagent\u2019s behavior is responsive to reasons. (Guidance control\nalso requires that an agent owns the mechanism on which she\nacts. According to Fischer and Ravizza, this requires placing\nhistorical conditions on responsibility; see\n \u00a73.3.3.)\n\nFischer and Ravizza\u2019s focus on mechanisms is motivated by the\nfollowing reasoning. In a Frankfurt case, an agent is responsible for\nan action even though his so acting is ensured by external factors.\nBut the presence of these external factors means that the agent in a\nFrankfurt case would have acted the same no matter what reasons he was\nconfronted with, which suggests that the responsible agent in a\nFrankfurt scenario is not responsive to reasons. This is a problem for\nFischer and Ravizza\u2019s claim that guidance control, and thus\nreasons-responsiveness, is necessary for responsibility. Fischer and\nRavizza\u2019s solution is to argue that while the agent in\na Frankfurt case may not be responsive to reasons, the agent\u2019s\nmechanism\u2014\u201cthe process that leads to the relevant upshot\n[i.e., the agent\u2019s action]\u201d\u2014may well be responsive\nto reasons (1998: 38). In other words, the agent\u2019s\ngenerally-specified psychological mechanism might have responded\n(under counterfactual conditions) to considerations in favor of\nomitting the action that the agent actually performed (and that he was\nguaranteed to perform, regardless of reasons, since he was in a\nFrankfurt-type scenario).\n\nFischer and Ravizza thus arrive at the following provisional\nconclusion: \u201crelatively clear cases of moral\nresponsibility\u201d\u2014that is, those in which an agent is not\nhypnotized, etc.\u2014are distinguished by the fact that \u201can\nagent exhibits guidance control of an action insofar as the mechanism\nthat actually issues in the action is his own, reasons-responsive\nmechanism\u201d (1998: 39). But how responsive to reasons\ndoes an agent\u2019s mechanism need to be for that agent to have the\ntype of control over his behavior associated with moral\nresponsibility? A strongly reasons-responsive mechanism would\nboth recognize and respond to any sufficient\nreason to act otherwise (1998: 41). (In Fischer and\nRavizza\u2019s terminology, such a mechanism is strongly\n\u201creceptive\u201d and \u201creactive\u201d to reasons). But\nstrong reasons-responsiveness cannot be required for guidance control\nsince many intuitively responsible agents\u2014i.e., many garden\nvariety wrongdoers\u2014fail to attend to sufficient reasons to do\notherwise. On the other hand, weak reasons-responsiveness is\nnot enough for guidance control. An agent with a weakly\nreasons-responsive mechanism will respond appropriately to\nsome sufficient reason to do otherwise, but the pattern of\nresponsiveness revealed in the agent\u2019s behavior might be too\narbitrary for the agent to be credited with the kind of control\nrequired for responsibility. A person\u2019s pattern of\nresponsiveness to reasons would likely seem erratic in the relevant\nway if, for example, she would forego purchasing a ticket to a\nbasketball game if it cost one thousand dollars, but not if it cost\ntwo thousand dollars (Fischer & Ravizza 1998: 66).\n\nFischer and Ravizza settle on moderate reasons responsiveness\nas the sort that is most germane to guidance control (1998:\n69\u201385). A psychological mechanism that is moderately responsive\nto reasons exhibits regularity with respect to its receptivity to\nreasons: that is, it exhibits \u201can understandable\npattern of (actual and hypothetical) reasons-receptivity\u201d\n(Fischer & Ravizza 1998: 71; emphasis in original). Such a pattern\nwill indicate that an agent understands \u201chow reasons fit\ntogether\u201d and that, for example, \u201cacceptance of one reason\nas sufficient implies that a stronger reason must also be\nsufficient\u201d (Fischer & Ravizza 1998: 71). (In addition, a\npattern of regular receptivity to reasons will include receptivity to\na range of moral considerations (Fischer & Ravizza 1998:\n77). This will rule out attributing moral responsibility to non-moral\nagents; see Todd and Tognazzini 2008 for criticism of Fischer and\nRavizza\u2019s articulation of this condition.) However, a moderately\nresponsive mechanism may be only weakly reactive to reasons\nsince, as Fischer and Ravizza put it (somewhat mysteriously),\n\u201creactivity is all of piece\u201d such \n\n\nthat if an agent\u2019s mechanism reacts to some incentive\nto\u2026[do otherwise], this shows that the mechanism can\nreact to any incentive to do otherwise. (1998: 73; emphasis\nin original)\n\n\nFischer and Ravizza\u2019s account has generated a great deal of\nattention and criticism. Some critics focus on the contrast (just\nnoted) between the conditions they impose on receptivity to reasons\nand those they impose on reactivity to reasons (McKenna 2005, Mele\n2006a, Watson 2001). Additionally, many are dissatisfied with Fischer\nand Ravizza\u2019s presentation of their account in terms of the\npowers of mechanisms as opposed to agents. This has led some authors\nto develop agent-based reasons-responsiveness accounts that address\nthe concerns that led Fischer and Ravizza to their mechanism-based\napproach (Brink & Nelkin 2013, McKenna 2013, Sartorio 2016).\n",
