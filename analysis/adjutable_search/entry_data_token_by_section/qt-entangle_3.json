Quantum Cryptography\n\nSuppose Alice and Bob are separated and want to communicate a secret\nmessage, without revealing any information to Eve, an eavesdropper.\nThey can do this in a classical world if they share a \u2018one-time\npad,\u2019 a cryptographic key represented by a sequence of random\nbits at least as long as the number of bits required to communicate\nthe message. In fact, this is the only secure way to achieve perfect\nsecurity in a classical world. To send a message to Bob, Alice\ncommunicates which bits in the key Bob should flip. The resulting\nsequence of bits is the message. In addition, they would need to have\nsome way of encoding messages as sequences of bits, by representing\nletters of the alphabet and spaces and punctuation symbols as binary\nnumbers, which could be done by some standard, publicly available\nscheme.\n\nThe problem is that messages communicated in this way are only secret\nif Alice and Bob use a different one-time pad for each message. If\nthey use the same one-time pad for several messages, Eve could gain\nsome information about the correspondence between letters of the\nalphabet and subsequences of bits in the key by relating statistical\nfeatures of the messages to the way words are composed of letters. To\nshare a new key they would have to rely on trusted couriers or some\nsimilar method to distribute the key. There is no way to guarantee the\nsecurity of the key distribution procedure in a classical world.\n\nCopying the key without revealing that it has been copied is also a\nproblem for the shared key that Alice and Bob each store in some\nsupposedly secure way. But the laws of physics in a classical world\ncannot guarantee that a storage procedure is completely secure, and\nthey cannot guarantee that breaching the security and copying the key\nwill always be detected. So apart from the key distribution problem,\nthere is a key storage problem.\n\nQuantum entanglement provides a way of solving these problems through\nthe \u2018monogamy\u2019 of entangled state correlations: no third\nparty can share entanglement correlations between Alice and Bob.\nMoreover, any attempt by Eve to measure the quantum systems in the\nentangled state shared by Alice and Bob will destroy the entangled\nstate. Alice and Bob can detect this by checking a Bell\ninequality.\n\nOne way to do this is by a protocol originally proposed by Artur\nEkert. Suppose Alice has a collection of photons, one for each\nentangled pair in the state \\(\\ket{0}\\ket{0} + \\ket{1}\\ket{1}\\)\n(ignoring the equal coefficients, for simplicity), and Bob has the\ncollection of paired photons. Alice measures the polarization of her\nphotons randomly in directions, \\(0, \\pi/8, 2\\pi/8\\) with respect to\nsome direction \\(z\\) they agree on in advance, and Bob measures the\npolarizations of his photons randomly in directions \\(\\pi/8, 2\\pi/8,\n3\\pi/8\\). They communicate the directions of their polarization\nmeasurements publicly, but not the outcomes, and they divide the\nmeasurements into two sets: one set when they both measured\npolarization in the direction \\(\\pi/8\\), or when they both measured\npolarization in the direction \\(2\\pi/8\\), and one set when Alice\nmeasured polarization in directions \\(0\\) or \\(2\\pi/8\\) and Bob\nmeasured polarization in directions \\(\\pi/8\\) or \\(3\\pi/8\\). For the\nfirst set, when they measured the polarization in the same direction,\nthe outcomes are random but perfectly correlated in the entangled\nstate so they share these random bits as a cryptographic key. They use\nthe second set to check a Bell inequality, which reveals whether or\nnot the entangled state has been altered by the measurements of an\neavesdropper. (See Ekert, 1991.)\n\nWhile the difference between classical and quantum information can be\nexploited to achieve successful key distribution, there are other\ncryptographic protocols that are thwarted by quantum entanglement. Bit\ncommitment is a key cryptographic protocol that can be used as a\nsubroutine in a variety of important cryptographic tasks. In a bit\ncommitment protocol, Alice supplies an encoded bit to Bob. The\ninformation available in the encoding should be insufficient for Bob\nto ascertain the value of the bit, but sufficient, together with\nfurther information (supplied by Alice at a subsequent stage when she\nis supposed to reveal the value of the bit), for Bob to be convinced\nthat the protocol does not allow Alice to cheat by encoding the bit in\na way that leaves her free to reveal either 0 or 1 at will.\n\nTo illustrate the idea, suppose Alice claims the ability to predict\nadvances or declines in the stock market on a daily basis. To\nsubstantiate her claim without revealing valuable information (perhaps\nto a potential employer, Bob) she suggests the following\ndemonstration: She proposes to record her prediction, before the\nmarket opens, by writing a 0 (for \u2018decline\u2019) or a 1 (for\n\u2018advance\u2019) on a piece of paper, which she will lock in a\nsafe. The safe will be handed to Bob, but Alice will keep the key. At\nthe end of the day\u2019s trading, she will announce the bit she\nchose and prove that she in fact made the commitment at the earlier\ntime by handing Bob the key. Of course, the key-and-safe protocol is\nnot provably secure from cheating by Bob, because there is no\nprinciple of classical physics that prevents Bob from opening the safe\nand closing it again without leaving any trace. The question is\nwhether there exists a quantum analogue of this procedure that is\nunconditionally secure: provably secure by the laws of physics against\ncheating by either Alice or Bob. Bob can cheat if he can obtain\nsome information about Alice\u2019s commitment before she\nreveals it (which would give him an advantage in repetitions of the\nprotocol with Alice). Alice can cheat if she can delay actually making\na commitment until the final stage when she is required to reveal her\ncommitment, or if she can change her commitment at the final stage\nwith a very low probability of detection.\n\nIt turns out that unconditionally secure two-party bit commitment,\nbased solely on the principles of quantum or classical mechanics\n(without exploiting special relativistic signaling constraints, or\nprinciples of general relativity or thermodynamics) is impossible. See\nMayers 1997, Lo and Chau 1997 and Lo\u2019s article \u201cQuantum\nCryptology\u201d in Lo, Popescu, and Spiller 1998 for further\ndiscussion. (Kent 1999 has shown that one can implement a secure\nclassical bit commitment protocol by exploiting relativistic signaling\nconstraints in a timed sequence of communications between verifiably\nseparated sites for both Alice and Bob.) Roughly, the impossibility\narises because at any step in the protocol where either Alice or Bob\nis required to make a determinate choice (perform a measurement on a\nparticle in the quantum channel, choose randomly and perhaps\nconditionally between a set of alternative actions to be implemented\non the particle in the quantum channel, etc.), the choice can delayed\nby entangling one or more ancilla particles with the channel particle\nin an appropriate way. By suitable operations on the ancillas, the\nchannel particle can be \u2018steered\u2019 so that this cheating\nstrategy is undetectable. In effect, if Bob can obtain no information\nabout the committed bit, then entanglement will allow Alice to\n\u2018steer\u2019 the bit to either 0 or 1 at will. \n\nIn 2022 the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)\nannounced a suite of encryption protocols designed to be secure\nagainst attacks by a quantum computer:\n NIST Announces First Four Quantum-Resistant Cryptographic Algorithms. \n",
