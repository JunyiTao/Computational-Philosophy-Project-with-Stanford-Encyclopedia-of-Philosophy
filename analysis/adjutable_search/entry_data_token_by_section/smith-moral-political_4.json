    "main_text": "Smith\u2019s Political Philosophy\n5. Smith\u2019s Political Philosophy\n\nIt is clear from the end of TMS that Smith intended to complement it\nwith a system of political philosophy, and it is clear from the\nAdvertisement to the last edition of TMS that WN represents the\npartial but not complete fulfillment of that plan. Strikingly, what\ngot left out was the part of political philosophy that most concerned\nSmith at the end of TMS, and that has most concerned other moral\nphilosophers who turn to politics: a systematic account of justice.\nSmith\u2019s lectures on jurisprudence dealt with this topic, and\nfrom the notes we have on those lectures, he seems to have hoped to\nbuild a comprehensive, universally-applicable theory of justice out of\nimpartial-spectator judgments about property, contract, punishment,\netc. But the manuscript drawn from these lectures was never finished,\nand he had it burned at his death. Some scholars speculate that the\nfailure of this project was fore-ordained: the moral theory of TMS is\ntoo particularist to sustain a universally-applicable theory of\njustice (see Griswold 1999, pp. 256\u20138 and Fleischacker 2004,\nchapter 8). Others have tried to re-construct such a theory for Smith\n(see Haakonssen 1981 and 1996).\n\nIn any case, Smith concluded his lectures on jurisprudence with some\nextended remarks on \u201cpolice\u201d\u2014public policy\n\u2014and this he did, of course, work up into a book of its own. It\nis unclear, however, how much WN has to do with his philosophical\nconcerns. Smith became increasingly interested in political economy\nafter completing TMS, and WN can be seen as the fruition simply of a\nnew direction in his research, unconnected to his moral system. He did\ncome to a comprehensive, one might say philosophical, view of\npolitical economy: from his understanding of the workings of\neconomics, he thought that states could foster the productiveness of\ntheir economies only by the rule of law, accompanied by a few\nlimitations on banking practices, and should otherwise lift measures\nthat restrict or encourage particular enterprises. The practical point\nof his treatise on economics was to urge this restrained, modest\napproach to economic intervention on governing officials. Smith did\nnot favor as hands-off an approach as some of his\nself-proclaimed followers do today\u2014he believed that states could\nand should re-distribute wealth to some degree, and defend the poor\nand disadvantaged against those who wield power over them in the\nprivate sector (see Fleischacker 2004, \u00a7 57)\u2014but he\ncertainly wanted the state to end all policies, common in his\nmercantilist day, designed to favor industry over agriculture, or some\nindustries over others. Smith believed strongly in the importance of\nlocal knowledge to economic decision-making, and consequently thought\nthat business should be left to businesspeople, who understand the\nparticular situations in which they work far better than any\ngovernment official (on this Hayek understood Smith well: see Hayek\n1978 [1976] and C. Smith 2013). By the same token, governance should be kept\nout of the hands of businesspeople, since they are likely to\nuse it to promote their particular interests, and not be concerned for\nthe well-being of the citizenry as a whole: Smith\u2019s opposition\nto the East India Company is based on this principle (see Muthu\n2008).\n\nSmith\u2019s political views tend more generally towards a minimalist\nstate. He did not want the state to micro-manage the economy, and he\nalso did not want it to promote religion or virtue. He was suspicious\nof the motives and skills of politicians, and their ability, even when\nwell-meaning, to change society (see Fleischacker 2004, chapter 11).\nAnd he did not believe that the political life was the crown of the\nmoral life, or that law or political institutions can help people\ndevelop virtue.\n\nOne might therefore wonder whether there is any connection between his\npolitics and his moral philosophy. Aside from the construction of\ntheories of justice\u2014which, as we have noted, Smith wound up\nnot doing\u2014there are three main reasons why moral\nphilosophers write political theories. Some, like Aristotle, see\nmorality as the cultivation of virtuous character and believe that the\nstate can help people with this cultivation. Others, like Jeremy\nBentham, see morality as maximizing human pleasure and believe that\nlegal and political reform can contribute significantly toward that\nend. And still others, like Hegel, see morality as the expression of\nfreedom and believe that states can embody the highest expression of\nfreedom. But Smith believes none of these things. His conception of\nmorality is quite Aristotelian, but for him the state can do little to\nhelp people achieve virtuous character. He shares neither\nBentham\u2019s reduction of the good life to the pleasurable life nor\nBentham\u2019s optimism about the likely effectiveness, for moral or\nhedonic purposes, of even much-reformed governments. And he never\ndescribes the state as an expression of freedom.\n\nThat leaves us with the possibility that Smith tries in WN precisely\nto try to cure his readers of the illusion that states have a moral\nfunction. There is a strong Stoic component to TMS, and we might say,\nin Stoic vein, that in WN Smith wants to help us see how much the\nsociety around us is out of our control. WN shows us the great degree\nto which social institutions and policies have unintended\nconsequences, the central role, in particular, of unforeseeable\nfactors in the workings of the market, and the fact that uncontrolled\nmarkets on the whole do well by all their participants. This allows us\nto become reconciled to allowing markets, and other social\ninstitutions, to run unfettered.\n\nSmith is more of an Enlightenment progressive than this reading\nsuggests, more of a believer that an enlightened understanding of\ntheir circumstances can help people improve those circumstances, but\nhe had less faith in this notion than did most of his contemporaries.\nThere are deep roots in his thought for a sceptical attitude towards\nprogressivism. His belief in local knowledge leads him to be\nsuspicious of large-scale plans for the reform of society. He also\nprovides a number of reasons for doubting whether we can successfully\nset for ourselves clear goals for such reform. For most enlightenment\nthinkers, including Smith\u2019s predecessors Hutcheson and Hume,\nwhat human beings desire seemed fairly obvious. For Smith, this is not\nso obvious. Smith believes that it is very difficult for us to know\nour true intentions (TMS 156\u20139), and that our desires are\nheavily shaped by social interaction. He also casts doubt on the\ndegree to which we seek things that are truly useful to our ends. In a\nfamous passage, he says that we are more interested in a thing\u2019s\napparent conduciveness to utility than in its actual\nutility (179\u201380). This observation serves as the jumping-off\npoint for his first foray into economics. The \u201cpoor man\u2019s\nson, whom heaven in its anger has visited with ambition\u201d pursues\nwealth without knowing what it is really like, because it\nseems\u2014falsely\u2014to be useful (181\u20133). In\nseveral ways, then, Smith pictures human desires and aims as more\nopaque than do most other Enlightenment thinkers. This picture informs\nhis distinctive account of society and history, moreover, according to\nwhich unintended consequences tend to be more important than intended\nones and the course of history is correspondingly unknowable in\nadvance. On such a view, it is futile for politicians to try to\ndetermine the future development of their societies. They do better\nrestricting their activities to protecting individual liberty against\nviolence\u2014to defense and the administration of justice.\n\nWe might call this the libertarian reading of Smith, and it certainly\ncaptures an important element of his political philosophy. Smith gives\njustice priority over the other virtues in TMS (86), he begins his\nlectures on jurisprudence by saying that the maintenance of justice is\n\u201cthe first and chief design of every system of government\u201d\n(Smith 1978, p. 5), and he brings in justice as a constraint on\neconomic activity many times in WN (e.g., WN 157, 539, 687). But he\ndoes not say that the enforcement of justice is the sole job of\ngovernment. The third of the tasks he gives to government in WN\nconsists in \u201cmaintaining and erecting\u201d a broad range of\n\u201cpublick works and \u2026 publick institutions\u201d for the\ngood of the whole society (WN 687\u20138). In TMS, the chapter often\nquoted as claiming that justice is the only virtue that may be\nenforced actually maintains only that \u201ckindness or beneficence,\n\u2026 cannot, among equals, be extorted by force\u201d\n(TMS 81). In a state \u201cantecedent to the institution of civil\ngovernment,\u201d Smith says, no impartial spectator would approve of\none person\u2019s using force to make another act beneficently. But\nonce civil government has been established, people may legitimately be\nforced to carry out at least the greatest and most obvious duties of\nbeneficence. Smith says that\n\n\n[t]he civil magistrate is entrusted with the power not only of\n\u2026 restraining injustice, but of promoting the prosperity of the\ncommonwealth, by establishing good discipline, and by\ndiscouraging every sort of vice and impropriety; he may prescribe\nrules, therefore, which not only prohibit mutual injuries among\nfellow-citizens, but command mutual good offices to a certain degree.\n(81, emphasis added)\n\n\nSmith warns against taking this license for a general promotion of\nvirtue too far\u2014that, he says, would be \u201cdestructive of all\nliberty, security, and justice\u201d\u2014but he also says that\nneglecting it will lead \u201cto many gross disorders and shocking\nenormities\u201d (TMS 81). These enormities may well include the\nmisery of the poor, a central concern of Smith\u2019s in WN. Smith\nhad no principled objections to government power being used to help\nthe poor, and indeed proposed a number of policies with that in mind.\nIt should be remembered that the idea that governments might massively\nre-distribute wealth out of fairness to the poor was not on the agenda\nin Smith\u2019s time. Only in the 1790s, after Smith died, did Jeremy\nBentham and Tom Paine offer their groundbreaking poverty programs; the\nsocialism of Robert Owen and Charles Fourier lay another generation in\nthe future. Until the late eighteenth century, most writers on the\nrole of government vis-\u00e0-vis the poor maintained that\ngovernments should keep the poor in poverty, so that they show proper\nrespect to their superiors and not waste money on drink. Smith had\nmore influence than anyone else in changing this attitude\u2014he was\none of the earliest and most fervent champions of the rights and\nvirtues of the poor, arguing against wage caps and other constraints\nthat kept the poor from rising socially and economically (see Baugh\n1983 and Fleischacker 2004, chapter 10).\n\nSmith also had a more restricted conception of individual rights than\ndo contemporary libertarians. Taxation does not count as any sort of\nthreat to property rights, for him\u2014he indeed describes paying\ntaxes as \u201ca badge \u2026 of liberty\u201d (WN 857)\u2014nor\ndoes the government\u2019s mere support for certain ideas and values\ncount as an infringement of the right to conscience. Although it may\nbe inefficient and otherwise unwise, it is not unjust for the\ngovernment to intervene in the economy on behalf of one or another\ncommercial interest, to spread propaganda for one or another\nconception of virtue, or even to establish a religion. Smith of course\nopposes economic intervention of this kind and thinks it better if\ngovernments do not establish religions, but his views on these issues\nstem from concerns other than justice. Moreover, he favors militia\ntraining to instill courage in people, state incentives urging people\nto study science and philosophy, and state encouragement for secular\namusements\u2014the latter two as an \u201cantidote to the poison of\n[religious] enthusiasm and superstition.\u201d (WN 796) So\nSmith\u2019s state is not a neutral one, in the modern sense, and it\nis not wholly uninterested in the promotion of virtue.\n\nWhy, then, does Smith recommend such a minimal state? The\ninterventions just listed are practically the only ones he urges in\nWN, and even in those cases, Smith calls for limited state action. Why\nallow governments to go so far, and no farther?\n\nThe first answer to that is that Smith did not think government\nofficials were competent to handle much beside the needs of defense\nand the administration of justice. Smith\u2019s writings are\npermeated by a lack of respect for the sorts of people who go into\npolitics: for the vanity that leads them to seek fame and power, for\nthe presumption by which they regard themselves as morally superior to\nothers, and for the arrogance by which they think they know the\npeople\u2019s interests and needs better than the people do\nthemselves. He also believes that politicians tend to be manipulated\nby the preaching of merchants who do not have the good of the nation\nas a whole at heart (WN 266\u20137), and that they can rarely know\nenough to guide large numbers of people. Correlatively, Smith has a\ngreat respect for the competence and virtue of common people. He shows\nno trace of the thought, common at the time and strongly held by\nHutcheson, that a class of wise and virtuous people ought to rule over\nthe common herd.\n\nIn addition, Smith holds that social sanctions can do a better job at\nmany tasks that other thinkers expected of political sanctions. His\nrich account in TMS of the way that spectators around us shape us\nmorally enables him to hold that governments need not teach\nvirtue. Society, independent of governmental power, will do that on\nits own. Thus sumptuary laws are unnecessary because the desire to\nmaintain or increase one\u2019s social status will keep most people\nprudent and frugal (WN 341\u20136). Thus religious groups that\nspontaneously arise without government assistance do a better job of\ninculcating virtues than their government-supported counterparts (WN\n792\u20136). And thus\u2014implicitly\u2014the civic republican\nobsession with a citizen militia is overwrought because the habits of\nself-command inculcated by military service can also be achieved, for\nmost people, by the social interactions of the market (see\nFleischacker 1999, pp. 153\u20136, 169\u201372).\n\nFinally, Smith limits the activities of governments because he\nconsiders it crucial to the development of virtue that people have\nplenty of room to act, and shape their feelings, on their own.\nBecoming a good human being is ultimately a task that each individual\nmust take up for him or herself. People develop better moral judgment\nby actually making moral judgments (WN 782\u20133, 788), and virtue\nrequires the practice of virtue (TMS 324); we cannot achieve these\nthings simply by following the say-so of an authority. So exercises of\npower tend to be inimical to moral development, and governments should\nuse their power mostly to minimize the degree to which power gets\nexercised elsewhere. \n\nIndeed, for Smith, governments can best encourage virtue precisely by\nrefraining from encouraging virtue. In TMS, the person who\nmerely tries to appear virtuous, whether out of fear of the law or out\nof fear of social disapproval, is not really virtuous. But there is a\nsliding scale here. One who acts virtuously out of concern for the\npraise and blame of her neighbors is not as virtuous as one who is\nconcerned to be praise-worthy in the eyes of an impartial spectator,\nbut one who acts virtuously out of concern for legal sanctions is\nworse than either of the other two. As long as neighbors know each\nother reasonably well, their approval and disapproval will normally\ntake into account the particular circumstances, the peculiar history\nand psychology, of the individuals they judge\u2014their judgments\nwill reflect, say, the difference in gratitude due to a loudly\nself-pitying parent as opposed to a truly long-suffering one. Legal\nsanctions are blunt instruments that cannot attend to such subtleties.\nSo social approval is more likely than legal approval to pick out the\nright sort of actions to mark for moral worth. Furthermore, since\nsocial sanctions are milder than legal sanctions\u2014it is much\neasier to ignore a neighbor\u2019s disapproval than a threat of\nimprisonment\u2014people who care about social sanctions display\nbetter character than people who can be motivated to good action only\nby the law. The pressure of social sanctions is more like, and more\nlikely to draw one towards, the pressure of conscience. Even if\nconcern for social approval is not the ideal motivation for moral\naction, therefore, it is at least some sign of good character, and a\nstep along the way to the motivations of the fully virtuous person.\nLegal sanctions by contrast affect our physical well-being and social\nstanding so severely that they drive out all thought of the sanctions\nof conscience. A government concerned to foster virtue in its citizens\nshould therefore aim as much as possible to remove its own sanctions\nfrom the pursuit of virtue. Governments foster virtue best where they\nrefuse, directly, to foster virtue at all: just as they protect\neconomic development best where they refuse, directly, to protect that\ndevelopment. This ironic conception of government power runs through\nSmith\u2019s political thinking. Accordingly, his main\npolitical object in writing WN is to instill modesty in policy-makers,\nto urge them to take on only very limited, well-defined tasks, and to\nrecognize that the flourishing of their society does not, on the\nwhole, much depend on them.\n\nIn sum, if Smith\u2019s political philosophy looks like\nlibertarianism, it is a libertarianism aimed at different ends, and\ngrounded in different moral views, than that of most contemporary\nlibertarians. Today, many libertarians are suspicious of the notion\nthat individuals ought to develop virtues expected of them by others:\nbeyond, at least, those virtues that are needed for the functioning of\nthe market and the liberal state themselves. Smith does not share this\nattitude. He is far from an agnostic about what a good human life\nlooks like, let alone an enthusiast for a conception of the good life\nthat eschews virtue in favor of preference-satisfaction. He is not a\npositivist sceptical of the significance of moral argument, like\nMilton Friedman, nor a hedonist, like Bentham and his followers, nor a\nradical individualist, like the followers of Ayn Rand. Any decent\nhuman life, he believes, requires certain virtues, and depends on a\nrespect and love of individuals for the people around them. If he\nencourages governments, nevertheless, to refrain from promoting\nvirtue, that is because he thinks that social forces can effectively\nachieve that end without government help, and that legal sanctions are\nin any case useless or counter-productive for the promotion of virtue.\nSo he may arrive at some libertarian conclusions, but not in the way\nthat most libertarians do.\n",
