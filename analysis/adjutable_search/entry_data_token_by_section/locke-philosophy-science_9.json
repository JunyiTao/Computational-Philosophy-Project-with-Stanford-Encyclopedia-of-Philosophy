    "main_text": "Locke and Newton\n4. Locke and Newton\n\nLocke and Newton probably first met in 1689 (though the exact date is\nnot known; Westfall 1980, p. 488; Rogers 1982, p. 219), and their main\nworks were written independently of one another; Locke\u2019s\nEssay,though published subsequently, was essentially complete\nby the time he read the Principia. A noticeable intellectual\naffinity may nevertheless be seen in those works, and the opportunity\nfor mutual influence followed as they established a friendship,\nexchanging views on a wide variety of subjects, not least certain\nunorthodox theological convictions (see Westfall 1980, 490\u201391).\nThe influence did not run in one direction alone; in a draft passage\nprobably penned shortly after the Principia\u2019s second\nedition, for example, Newton adopts a Lockean tone as he denies that\nany ideas are\n innate.[25]\n As for Newton\u2019s influence upon Locke, the best-known example\nconcerns action at a distance, as noted below, though there are deeper\nquestions about methodology.\n",
