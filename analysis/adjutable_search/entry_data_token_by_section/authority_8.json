    "main_text": "The Puzzle of Political Authority: Philosophical Anarchism || A Worry about the Instrumentalist Account of Practical Reason\n3.2 A Worry about the Instrumentalist Account of Practical Reason\n\n\nThe power of this account of political authority and the duty to\nobey depends essentially on the account of practical reasoning that\nlies at its base. Many have argued that this conception of practical\nreasoning is flawed. They have worried that the indirect form of\npractical reasoning that it requires is not legitimate. The worry can\nbe stated fairly easily. The form of practical reasoning this account\nof authority includes requires that we ignore the reasons that apply\ndirectly to the action we are about to undertake even though sometimes\nthose reasons will count against the action. The question arises, when\nare the reasons that directly apply to the action so strongly opposed\nto the action that we must override the preemptive reason?\n\n\nIn the case of rule following, we sometimes encounter particular\ninstances in which following the rule is counterproductive. How do we\ndetermine when we ought to follow the rule and when we ought not to\nfollow the rule? Does such determination involve the very deliberation\nabout particular instances that was meant to be excluded by the rule?\nSome have argued that rule following cannot be rational since it cannot\nbe rational to ignore the particular facts of each case (Hurd\n2001).\n\n\nRaz's main response to this criticism has been to say that we look\nfor clear cases in which the rule is to be overridden and ignore the\nother cases and that only by doing this do we best comply with reason.\nLimiting exceptions to the rule to clear cases obviates the need for\ndeliberation in every case.\n",
