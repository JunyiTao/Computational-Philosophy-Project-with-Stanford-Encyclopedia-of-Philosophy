African Words for Ethics (or Morality)\n\n\nWe would begin with an inquiry into African moral language, in\nsearch specifically of the word for \u2018ethics\u2019 in a few\nAfrican languages. Such an inquiry will give some insight into the\nbasic conception and understanding of ethics or morality. It must be\nnoted right from the outset that a substantial number of Sub-Saharan\nAfrican languages do not have words that can be said to be\ndirect equivalents of the word \u2018ethics\u2019 or\n\u2018morality\u2019. Here are some interesting results of inquiries\nmade from native speakers of a few African languages and how\nstatements about a person's ethical or moral conduct are expressed in\nthose languages, including two of the prominent languages in Ghana,\nAkan (the author's native language) and Ewe.\n\nWhen a speaker of the Akan language wants to say, \u201cHe has\nno morals\u201d, or, \u201cHe is immoral\u201d, or \u201cHe is\nunethical\u201d, \u201cHis conduct is unethical\u201d, he would\nalmost invariably say, \u201cHe has no character\u201d\n(Onni suban).\nThe statement, \u201cHe has no morals\u201d, or \u201cHe is\nunethical\u201d, is expressed by a speaker of the Ewe language as,\nnonomo mele si o (which means \u201cHe has no\ncharacter\u201d).\nIn Yoruba language and thought the word iwa means both\ncharacter and morality (it also means \u2018being\u2019 or\n\u2018nature\u2019).\nIn Igbo language of Eastern Nigeria, the word agwa,\nmeaning character, is used in such a statement as \u201che has no\nmorals\u201d (onwe ghi ezi agwa).\nIn Shona, the language spoken by a substantial majority of the\npeople of Zimbabwe, the word tsika means \u2018ethics\u2019\nor \u2018morality\u2019. But when they want to say of a person that\n\u201cHe has no morals\u201d, or \u201cHe is unethical\u201d, they\nwould often use the word hunhu which directly means\n\u2018character\u2019. Thus, Haana hunhu means \u201cHe has\nno character\u201d, \u201cHe is not moral\u201d, \u201cHe is\nunethical\u201d.\nIn South Sotho, a language spoken widely in Lesotho and southern\nZimbabwe (Matebeleland), there are no words that are the direct\nequivalents of \u2018ethics\u2019 or \u2018morality\u2019.\nReferences to the moral or ethical life or behavior are made using\nwords that mean behavior or character. Thus, moral statements such as\n\u201che has no morals\u201d or \u201chis action is unethical\u201d\nwill be expressed by words such as maemo\u2014which means\ncharacter or behavior: thus, maemo a mabe means \u201che has\na bad character\u201d, \u201chis behavior (action) is\nunethical.\u201d When a person behaves (or acts) in ways that are\nmorally right, they would say \u201che has a good character\u201d,\nusing the words lokileng or boitswaro, both of which\nmean good character or good behavior.\n\n\n\nThus, the inquiries into the moral language of several African\npeoples or cultures indicate that in these languages the word or\nexpression that means \u2018character\u2019 is used to refer to what\nothers call \u2018ethics\u2019 or \u2018morality\u2019. Discourses\nor statements about morality turn to be discourses or statements\nessentially about character. In Islamic moral philosophy the word used\nfor \u2018ethics\u2019, namely, akhlaq, means character. The\nimplication here is that ethics or morality is conceived in terms\nessentially of character. It is noteworthy that the Greek word\nethike, from which the English word \u2018ethics\u2019\nderives means \u2018character.\u2019 (ethos) What we call\n\u2018ethics\u2019 Aristotle calls \u2018the study (or, science) of\ncharacter\u2019, he ethike. For the Greek, as for the\nAfrican and the Arab, the character of the individual matters most in our moral\nlife and thought. \n",
