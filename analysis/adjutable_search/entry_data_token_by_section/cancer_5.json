    "main_text": "Explaining Cancer: Theories, Models and Mechanisms || Complicating the Mechanistic Picture: Tissue Organization, Stem Cells and Systems Theory\n2.2 Complicating the Mechanistic Picture: Tissue Organization, Stem Cells and Systems Theory\n\nCritics of the somatic mutation theory and the search for mechanisms\nof cancer at the cell and molecular level have raised a variety of\nobjections, some methodological, some conceptual, and some empirical.\nIndeed, some critics combine all three. In the late 1990s, and early\n2000s, Soto and Sonnenschein proposed an alternative to the\n\u201csomatic mutation theory\u201d (SMT), the Tissue Organization\nField Theory (or, TOFT) (Sonnenschein & Soto 2000). They object\nnot only to reductionist methodology of advocates of SMT, but also to\nthe empirical claim that mutations are in fact causes of cancer. They\nargue instead that cancer is a product of \u201calterations in the\ncommunication among cells and tissues that affect tissue\narchitecture\u201d (2013, p. 90). On this view, mutations do not\n\u201clead the way\u201d in cancer, but instead follow upon\ndisruptions to tissue organization. It is these alterations of\npatterns of interaction between cells that leads to \u201cdownward\ncausation effects\u201d on cells and cellular components, inducing\naneuploidy and mutations (Soto & Sonnenschein 2006; Sonnenschein\n& Soto 2008). Let us address their arguments, turning first to\nmethodological concerns about warranted inference from cell culture or\nmodel organism work to general claims about cancer etiology.\n\nGiven that the development of cancer is an immensely complex causal\nprocess that cannot be observed directly, many scientific claims about\ncancer\u2019s causes are based on indirect inference, using model\norganisms or cells in culture. For instance, tumors are grown in nude\nmice using xenotransplantation, or tumors are observed to grow in mice\nin which \u201cdriver genes\u201d are \u201cknocked out.\u201d\nSoto and Sonnenschein have argued that these artificial experimental\ncircumstances render judgments about the causal efficacy of mutations\nin cancer suspect. They are raising methodological questions about the\nscope and limitations of model organism work. Soto and Sonnenschein\nfurther argue that there are other equally adequate explanations of\ncancer\u2019s emergence, and these explanations can accommodate\nphenomena that the SMT cannot. For instance, they claim that cancer\ncells\u2019 normalization when placed in healthy tissue cannot be\nexplained by the SMT. Tissue organization, on their view, exerts\n\u201cdownward causation\u201d on cancer cells, preventing or\npromoting their development into a tumor. Their claims about\n\u201cdownward causation\u201d have led philosophers to weigh in on\nthe debate (Malaterre 2011; Bertolaso 2016; Green 2021). Malaterre\n(2011) argues that advocates of TOFT need not commit to downward\ncausation (interpreted as an appeal to non-reductive physicalism, or\nemergent properties). Instead, he argues, dynamic relationships\nbetween variables that supervene over molecular and cellular\nactivities can do the same work, via a \u201chigher level,\u201d or\nless granular explanation of cancer etiology.\n\nDo such cases genuinely count as downward causation in, for instance,\nKim\u2019s (2000) sense? After all, strictly speaking, the idea that\ncausation is synchronic across the whole and part of the same entity\nseems contradictory. Soto and Sonnenschein propose that the kind of\ncausation they are invoking is not synchronic, but \u201cdiachronic\nemergence\u201d: \u201ccellular and tissue events occurring before\nthe expression of a particular set of genes takes place may act\ndownwardly modifying the expression of these genes at a later\ntime\u201d (Soto, et al. 2008, 271). This, however, seems to be not\nas radical a metaphysical thesis as talk of downward causation may\ninitially suggest. This seems instead a form of constraint. Green\n(2021) takes \u201cdownward causation\u201d in such contexts to\nrefer to : \u201cthe role of solid-state tissue properties in tumor\nprogression \u2026 understood as constraining relations between\ntissue-scale and micro-scale variables\u201d (p. 1). While this\nsuggestion is \u201ca \u2018weaker\u2019 form of downwards\ncausation than the one Kim (2000) and others oppose,\u201d and so\ndeparts from standard use of the expression, the advantage of this\nweaker notion that it better captures what scientists have in mind\nwhen arguing for the \u201cnecessity of higher-scale features for the\nrealization and understanding of biological phenomena.\u201d\nSimilarly, Bertolaso (2016) argues that cancer is an instance of\nsynchronic reflexive emergence\u2014\u201ca different mode of\ncausation. In such a mode, effects are not expressed in terms of a\nprogression of events, but of maintenance of states at different\nlevels of biological organization\u201d (Bertolaso 2016, p. 95).\n\nIt seems that each of these authors is pointing to an important role\nfor structural organization of tissues in the maintenance of\nhomeostasis or conversely in carcinogenesis. It seems such examples do\nnot point to \u201cdownward causation,\u201d in Kim\u2019s sense,\nbut instead suggest that we simply cannot predict or explain cancer\nsolely in terms of properties of \u201cmicro-\u201d level parts but\nneed to expand our understanding of the causes of cancer to include\nmaintenance of tissue integrity. That is, the case of cancer seems to\nrequire a richer, more integrative and interdisciplinary approach to\ninvestigating causation at multiple levels.\n\nIt seems that each of these authors is pointing to an important role\nfor structural organization in the maintenance of homeostasis as\nplaying an important role in carcinogenesis. Indeed, evidence provided\nby Bissell\u2019s lab (Weaver, et al. 1997, 2002) seems to indicate\nthat structural features of the extracellular matrix somehow either\nprevent the emergence of disease, or can accelerate it (on\nBissell\u2019s lab, see Plutynski 2018b). It seems such examples do\nnot point to \u201cdownward causation,\u201d but instead suggest\nthat we need to expand our understanding of the causes of cancer to\ninclude maintenance of tissue integrity. That is, the case of cancer\nseems to require a richer, more integrative and interdisciplinary\napproach to investigating cancer.\n\nSoto, Sonnenschein, and others have argued that the SMT and TOFT are\nmutually incompatible and cancer research needs a paradigm shift\n(Bizzarri and Cuccina, 2016). Others argue that they can be fruitfully\nintegrated (Bertolaso, 2011; Marcum 2005; Malaterre, 2007; Bedessem\nand Ruphy, 2015; Baxendale, 2019). Today, SMT and TOFT represent two\nextremes along a continuum of views about the central causal role of\ngenetic mutations in cancer. Most researchers grant that mutations are\none among many other causal factors in cancer.\n\nFor instance, the tumor microenvironment (TME) is now considered\nanother key factor (see Maman and Witz, 2018 for a historical review).\nHowever, there are some open questions about what falls within the\nTME\u2019s spatial and temporal boundaries, and what causal relevance\nspatial organization and temporal order have for cancer (Rondeau et\nal. 2019; Laplane et al., 2018, 2019b). Some interesting ambiguous\ncases are provided by nutrition (Sholl 2022) and by the microbiota\n(Sholl et al. 2022). Increasingly, there are indications that changes\nin the microbiome (both of cancer, and of the organism as a whole) may\nplay an important role in cancer initiation and progression,\nsuggesting that data about the microbiome may be relevant to\ndiagnosis, prognosis, and choice of therapies (Sholl et al. 2022).\nMoreover, given that microbes can be transmitted vertically (during\ncell division) as well as horizontally (between neighboring cells),\nand are themselves subject to evolution, Sepich-Poore et al. (2022)\nsuggest reconsidering clonal evolution in cancer as a multispecies\nprocess. Experimental study of the role of microbes in cancer is\ndifficult, however, raising several questions about pragmatic and\nepistemic trade-offs. The complexity and heterogeneity on both sides\nof the microbiome-cancer relationship makes generating robust causal\nhypotheses difficult (Parke and Plutynski, 2023).\n\nAnother major research program that in some ways challenges a\nmechanistic picture of cancer is the \u201ccancer stem cell\u201d\ntheory (CSC). Fagan (2016) characterizes the notion of a cancer stem\ncell, as well as the current state of the field, as follows:\n\nCancer stem cells (CSCs) are thought to be a small subpopulation of\nself-renewing stem cells within a tumor or blood-borne cancer, which\nare responsible for maintaining and growing the malignancy. This idea\nhas significant clinical implications. If the CSC model is correct,\nthe current clinical strategy of seeking to eradicate all\ncancer cells should be revised, to specifically target CSC.\n\n\nThe cancer stem cell theory in part is descended from the view that\ncancers are in several ways akin to ordinary tissue (though\ndistorted), containing a mixture of proliferating stem cells and their\nmore differentiated progeny. This view played an important role in\ncancer research in the 1960s and 1970s and is sometimes called the\n\u201cdevelopmental\u201d theory of cancer, in light of the fact\nthat it takes cancer to be a disease of \u201cdevelopment,\u201d or\ncellular differentiation in particular (Pierce & Speers 1988,\nMorange 2015, Laplane 2014). This model of cancer etiology was revived\nin the 90s, when Lapidot, Bonnet, and Dick identified \u201cleukemic\nstem cells\u201d (Lapidot, et al. 1994, Bonnet and Dick 1997), and\nwas expanded upon in the early 2000s with the identification of an\nanalogous cell population in breast cancer, suggesting that CSCs are a\ngeneral feature of all cancers (Al-Hajj, et al. 2003). The notion that\nthere are subpopulations of cells within a tumor that play a\ndistinctive role\u2014either in initiating a cancer, or in seeding\nnew cancers, has been influential in current research, suggesting new\navenues for both treatment and prevention.\n\nHistorically the cancer stem cell theory (CSC) was framed in\nopposition to the somatic mutation theory and the clonal evolution\nmodel, according to which cancer cells diversify and evolve through\nthe acquisition of mutations (e.g. Reya, et al. 2001; Wicha, et al.\n2006; Shipitsin, et al. 2007). But soon it appeared that rather than\nsee the two theories as mutually exclusive, we might see the two as\ncomplementary, in the process of integration, or overlapping models.\nFagan (2016) argues that on a \u201cmodel-based\u201d approach,\nit\u2019s not clear that these two theories are inconsistent. Laplane\n(2018) has pointed out how the CSC can serve to supplement the\nevolutionary perspective. The presence and number of cancer stem cells\ncan affect the rate and nature of evolutionary change in a population\nof cancer cells. Essentially, if all cells in a tumor are descended\nfrom one or a few cancer stem cells, this restricts population size,\nand thus suggests that to a large extent cancer progression is driven\nby drift, rather than selection. Lyne et al. (2021) develop this\nargument with a mathematical model, and question the ubiquitous\nassumption that linear evolution, in which each new clone arises from\nthe latest one and tend to almost outcompete it, is the output of\nnatural selection. Such inference can only be warranted if the number\nof contributing stem cells is high enough to prevent clonal evolution\nby drift.\n\nThere are several open questions about the causal role of stem cells\nin both preventing and promoting cancer. Cairns (1975) originally\nproposed the hypothesis that the hierarchical organization of tissues,\nwith the tissue stem cells producing all the other cells, may prevent\ncancer, by allowing only a few relatively protected cells to serve as\nprogenitors in somatic cell division, thus reducing the risk of\naccumulated mutations (Cairns 1975). More recently, a similar idea led\nto the claim that the risk of cancer is mostly a matter of bad luck,\nproportional to the number of stem cell divisions in each tissue\n(Tomasetti and Vogelstein 2015; Tomasetti et al. 2017). This has led\nto a vivid debate on the explanatory relevance of the variation in the\nnumber of stem cell divisions by tissues in the variation of the\nlifetime risk of cancer in these tissues. However, the lack of\nconceptual clarity and argumentative consistency of the initial papers\nand its critics has hindered the debate (Plutynski 2021b). \n\nDiscussion of the role and nature of cancer stem cells, however, is\ncomplicated by the fact that there is a great deal of dispute around\nwhat counts as a cancer stem cell (for questions about what counts as\na stem cell, outside of cancer, see Fagan\u2019s work, especially\nFagan 2013 and Fagan 2021). Laplane (2016), Fagan (2016), and Germain\n(2014) draw attention to the fact that the concept of cancer stem cell\nis multiply ambiguous, in at least the following ways:\n\nFirst, when we speak of cancer stem cells, we may be referring to\ntheir capacities, or to their historical role or genealogy, i.e., to\nthe fact that they were the cells from which other cancer cells\noriginate. That is, some take cancer stem cells to be defined in terms\nof their distinctive capacities and some in terms of their\nrelationship to other cells\u2014in particular, to their\nancestor-descendent relationships in a population of cells in a tumor.\nThe \u201ccancer stem cell model\u201d is sometimes simply taken to\nrefer to any model of a tumor that treats the population of cells as\nhaving a hierarchical relationship, where one or a few cells propagate\nthe tumor, whether or not those cells have distinctive properties that\ncause them to stand in that relationship.\nSecond, there are several different kinds of historical role that\nCSCs might play: They may be all and only those cells that initiate a\ncancer under natural conditions, they may be those cells which\npropagate a cancer in situ, or they may be those cells that are\ncapable of propagating a cancer in an experimental animal.\nXenotransplantation experiments used to assess CSCs are \u201chighly\nartificial\u201d contexts, that may or may not warrant the\nconclusions researchers claim to establish. Xenotransplantation, for\ninstance, has been used to articulate and test hypotheses about\n\u201cintrinsic tumorigenicity\u201d of CSCs. The problem with using\nthese tools, however, is that the matter of when and whether a cell is\n\u201ctumorigenic\u201d varies across different backgrounds. For\nexample, CSCs may develop tumors in some mouse models and not others,\ndepending on their immune deficiency. Which experimental context is\nrelevant to understanding how and why cancer is caused by CSCs thus\ndepends upon which causes we wish to isolate, and how.\nThird, some take the concept of CSC to be restricted to normal\nstem cells, which some believe are the most likely precursors to\ncancer. Others hold that cells that originate a tumor have stem-like\nproperties but may or may not derive from normal stem cells.\n\n\nWhat\u2019s clear is that some populations of cells in a tumor appear\nto have \u201cstemness\u201d properties\u2014the ability to renew\noneself. What is less clear is whether these capacities are context\nsensitive, and how and by which cells they may be acquired. The\nplasticity of many types of cancer cells suggests that they may\nacquire a stemness phenotype, and even shift back to non-stem\nphenotype. Given this, it appears that the CSC is just one of a\ncontinuum of general views, some of which take only specific types of\ncells to be precursors to cancer and others which grant that many\ndifferent types of cells have the potential to develop such\nproperties. That is, the real question at issue is whether the cells\nthat initiate a tumor are in some way distinctive or require\ndistinctive precursors, and how properties of stemness are acquired.\nWhether stemness is intrinsic or acquirable, niche-dependent or\nindependent, moreover, will drastically change the therapeutic\nstrategy. The CSC model (the idea that CSC are at the origin of cancer\ndevelopment, resistance to treatment, and relapse) might be true and\nyet CSC-targeting strategy might fail. Indeed, what kind of property\n\u201cstemness\u201d is may vary across cancers, and even over time\nwithin a cancer (Laplane and Solary 2019a; Laplane 2016).\n\nIn sum, there appear to remain several open questions about the nature\nof cancer stem cells, and more generally, how to best intervene upon\ncancer to successfully eradicate the disease. According to the model\nof the disease inherited from the latter third of the 20th Century,\nsomatic mutations, acquired over a lifetime, to the acquisition of\ncancer\u2019s \u201challmarks.\u201d So, the best strategy for\nintervention may be targeting specific pathways associated with these\nhallmarks. In contrast, according to the TOFT, changes in tissue\norganization yield carcinogenesis. Thus, the best strategy for\nintervention might be finding ways to intervene in the tissue\nmicroenvironment, so as to create an environment less hospitable to\nthe growth of cancer cells. According to the cancer stem cell theory,\ncancer arises in cells that have distinctive properties: continuous\nrenewal, and indefinite growth, permitting the emergence of new\ndisease. On this view, eradicating these stem cells seems essential to\ncancer treatment. Philosophical work on cancer causation and\nexplanation can better illuminate the competing presuppositions of\ndifferent approaches, clarify their commitments, and offer insights\ninto fruitful integration of new data. It is already clear that\nphilosophical discussions of ambiguities in how we define and measure\nstemness is essential to understanding how best to prevent recurrence\nand treat the disease (Clevers 2016).\n",
