    "main_text": "Philip\u2019s Career as Chancellor\n2. Philip\u2019s Career as Chancellor\n\n\nThe position of chancellor at the cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris was\none of some importance, although it was the lowest ranking office in\nthe administrative hierarchy of the chapter. Minor duties included\nkeeping the official seal of the chapter, executing the official\ndecrees of the administrative body, maintaining the non-musical books\nof the library, and serving in the liturgy of the daily office. His\nmost significant responsibility was in the area of education. The\nchancellor was originally the head of the cathedral school. As masters\nbegan to flock to Paris in the late twelfth and early thirteenth\ncenturies, especially to the Ile-de-la-Cit\u00e9, where Notre Dame\nis located, the chancellor\u2019s supervision was extended to include\nthese masters as well. His power lay in his authority to grant the\nteaching license, which was required in order to hold classes in one\nof the schools springing up on the Ile-de-la-Cit\u00e9. It was the\nchancellor\u2019s duty to evaluate candidates applying for this\nlicense. Moreover, the chancellor had the right to revoke the license\nshould a master prove unworthy or incompetent, as well as the\nresponsibility for maintaining order and discipline among the scholars\nwithin his jurisdiction. \n\n\nBy the time Philip became chancellor in 1217, the masters of the\nvarious schools in Paris had begun to seek autonomy from the cathedral\nchapter and had won a number of important concessions by papal decree.\nIn 1215, the papal legate, Robert of Cour\u00e7on, drew up a number\nof formal statutes, codifying the de facto practices\nregarding matters such as the examinations for teaching licenses,\naccepted dress and behavior, curriculum, and discipline of\nstudents. As a result, by the time that Philip became chancellor, at\nleast on paper, it appeared as if the power of his office had been\ngreatly reduced, even with respect to granting the teaching\nlicense. For although the chancellor retained the power to grant these\nlicenses, the statutes dictated that he could not turn down anyone the\nmasters deemed fit to teach. But in reality, a long struggle ensued\nbetween the masters and the chancellor, who sought to retain his\npower, beginning with Philip\u2019s predecessor (Stephen of Reims)\nand continuing into much of Philip\u2019s own tenure.  Finally, in\nthe late 1220s and early 1230s, Philip made his peace with the\nmasters, who had gone on strike and left Paris along with many of\ntheir students in response to a conflict with the secular authorities.\nNo doubt recognizing that their departure imperiled the continuing\nprestige of Paris as a center of education, as well as his own\nposition, Philip worked hard to convince the scholars to return to\nParis and reconvene their classes. His efforts were successful, and\nthe masters returned in 1231 (for more on Philip\u2019s life and\ncareer, see Payne 1991).\n",
