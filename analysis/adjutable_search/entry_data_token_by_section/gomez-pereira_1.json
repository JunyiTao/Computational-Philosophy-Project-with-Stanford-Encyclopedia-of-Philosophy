Epistemology and Nominalism\n\nLike some other figures of his time, G\u00f3mez Pereira took great\ninterest in exposing the shortcomings and difficulties he encountered\nin scholastic natural philosophy. The Aristotelian scheme seemed to\nhim insufficient, so he directed severe criticism at it for being\nunclear or even contradictory in some essential respects, especially\nthose which had to do with the explanation of life and the\ncontroversial issue of the nature and origin of the soul.\n\nAbout his own vision of empirical method and scientific research, the\nPrologues of his books provide us with enlightening information. In\nhis Novae veraeque medicinae Pereira proclaims that the duty\nof a scientist is to use the instruments of logic and experience to\nreach the truth, without becoming entangled in the subtleties of\nlanguage and sterile sophistry. In this sense, Pereira denounces\nErasmus and his followers for having wasted the intelligence of many\nyoung people who could have devoted themselves to science (NVM: 1a).\nAlso, at the beginning of the Antoniana Pereira rejects the\nprinciple of authority if it is used to replace rational\ndemonstration. Against those who base their doctrines in Aristotle,\nPereira says: \n\n\nwriters of this kind would have had more respect for their readers if\nthey had demonstrated what they believed to be true by means of solid\nreasoning. (AM: I.193) \n\n\nAs we shall see, the epistemology formulated by Pereira in\nhis Antoniana was built on a deep criticism of the philosophy\nof Aristotle and scholastic realism.\n\nThe Antoniana begins by denouncing the incoherencies that\nPereira finds if we admit that animals and humans share sensory\nperception. These inconsistencies are based on an erroneous analysis\nof the process that leads from the images to the mental concept. In\nthis process two elements need to be present. First, we receive some\nspecies from the external objects through our own\nsense-organs. However, these species are not yet properly\nsensations; to get these last some animadversio is also\nnecessary: \n\n\nOnce our sensory organs have been fashioned, in accordance with what\nis due to happen, by a visual image or something corresponding to a\nvisual image, human beings should still not be called\n\u2018sentient\u2019 unless they turn the acuteness of their mind\nupon the object they want to recognise. (AM: I.273) \n\n\nFrom sensation thus configured, the mind which pays attention\nto those species builds, at a higher cognitive level, the\nnotio of the object (AM: I.275).\n\nNow, Pereira emphasized that all this is a process in which multiple\ninstances can be differentiated only conceptually; there is a unique\nsubject of this process: the entire soul, which first pays attention\nto an object and later constructs the notion of it. What is more, the\nattention of the soul is nothing other than the soul itself, which\nfocuses on one object rather than on any other and does it\nspontaneously. In other words, its own attention is not accidental,\nbut what Pereira himself called a mode of being: so, the act\nof knowing is not realiter anything other than the soul\nitself (AM: I.295). In this conception, the body does not participate\nin knowledge, nor is knowledge different from the soul\n(Gonz\u00e1lez Vila 1975: 28\u201329). It is likely that\nnominalism, during its ephemeral implantation in Spain in the first\nhalf of the sixteenth century, had a decisive influence on\nPereira\u2019s thought; he certainly aimed at contradicting the\nRealistic notion of St. Thomas about the soul, which assumed that the\nsoul\u2019s faculties are diversified by their acts and, in turn,\ntheir acts are diversified by their objects (Thomas Aquinas, Summa\nTheologiae, I, q. 77, a. 3). Against this conception, the Spanish\nauthor affirmed that the soul is always equivalent to its acts, so he\nultimately criticized Aristotle for having turned to a group of\ndifferentiated faculties in his description of the cognitive process:\nsuch a plurality was unnecessary.\n\nAn example of this criticism can be found at the moment when the\nexistence of the common sense is rejected in the Antoniana\n(AM: I.371\u2013373). This is the faculty responsible for processing\nthe so-called common sensibles, that is, those common objects\nof perception which are co-incidental to the exclusive objects of each\nsense (i.e., motion, rest, number, figure etc.; see Aristotle, De\nAnima, III, 1\u20132). In opposition to Aristotle, Pereira\nargued that, if the common sense is an organic faculty, so that it\nperceives what has been previously perceived by the senses, it would\nmake the latter unnecessary and we should be obliged to conclude that\nnature has created many organs to do what it could with fewer, which\ngoes against its own principles. It is, therefore, better to maintain\nthat it is the soul itself, as an indivisible unity, which perceives,\njudges and differentiates all the sensibles: the soul is present, in\neffect, in all parts of the living body and is affected in a similar\nway by all the sense organs.\n\nFor Pereira there is no real difference between the sensory and\nintellectual faculties. Neither must they be understood as two\ndifferent accidents of one unique substance, i.e., the soul,\nbecause such a diversity would make impossible to explain how, if the\nobjects of both sense and intellect are different realiter,\nthey can converge on a single object: it would then be necessary to\nappeal for a third power or faculty which would analyze both objects\nand, finally, link them. In addition, the unity of the soul would be\nbroken, because it would be divisible according to the various objects\nit can perceive and understand; in this case one could not explain how\nit is possible that, since those different objects are processed by\ndifferent cognitive faculties, knowledge is always a simultaneous and\nindivisible achievement. Pereira emphasized that this is only because\nthe subject that reaches this knowledge is necessarily one and\nindivisible (AM: I.379\u2013381).\n\nSimilarly, because of the unity and indivisibility of the soul, the\nauthor rejected the existence of intelligible species. For\nhim, these species may not be extracted from\nphantasmata since these have a corporeal constitution, while\nintelligible species are immaterial by definition; but our\nintellect is unable to generate a spiritual substance from a material\none: God alone is endowed with such a power (AM: I.409). Almost a\ncentury after Pereira had formulated this argument, Descartes resorted\nto a very similar one to support his own rejection of intelligible\nspecies as well as of the possibility that ideas can be caused by\nbodies (see, for example, Descartes, Meditationes AT, p. 41;\nabout the historical precedents of Descartes\u2019 theory see Spruit\n1995, vol. II, pp. 379\u2013386: unfortunately, Spruit did not have\naccess to the Antoniana, so he could not introduce Pereira\namong the possible influences that Descartes received from earlier\nphilosophy). For the Spanish doctor it was then much more efficient to\nexplain the intellectual process on the basis of considering that all\ncognitive activity, whether sensory or intelligible, not only depends\non the soul but, in fact, identifies with it.\n\nA new question then emerges: what is the difference between sensory\nperception and understanding? Pereira\u2019s answer was that there\nare not diverse instances of knowledge but rather a unique process\nthat progressively reaches various stages of refinement. Basing\nhimself on the Preface of Aristotle\u2019s\nPhysics, he examined these various stages through which the\nuniversal concept would pass (AM: I.439\u2013441). This concept can\nbe confused or distinct: the confused concept is that which covers a\ncomplete genus without any distinction of the species\ncontained therein, while the distinct one is precisely that which\ndefines the designated object with all the categories that belong to\nit. There are then two forms of knowledge: one of them is less subtle\nbecause it rests upon the mere assertion of the existence of an\nobject, and the other is subtler because it distinguishes with clarity\nall the elements that are present in it. Given the nature of our own\ncognitive potentiality, it is always easier to have access to the\nfirst type of universal cognition; only through effort and exercising\nshall we be able to achieve a greater determination in our own\nunderstanding.\n\nTo illustrate this cognitive progression, Pereira explained how we can\nachieve the abstract notion of substance: \n\n\nIf I want to understand the substance of a square white wall, I turn\nmy mind away from thinking about whiteness, and quantity, and shape,\nand location, and when it was built, and all the other individual\ncircumstances connected with the wall, every one of which I had\nrecognised beforehand, either by means of my external senses, or\nconceived earlier abstractly in my imagination, and I draw forth\ncognition of something I have never perceived sensorily, namely, the\nsubject of these things. (AM: I.445) \n\n\nThis process is accomplished by us spontaneously. Pereira said that it\nis simply a quality that belongs to our soul by nature and allows us\nto extract species from genera. We do all this by ourselves and in\nourselves, since, as he repeatedly emphasized, the intellect, the act\nof thinking, and the object thought are the same, i.e., the unique and\nindivisible human soul (AM: I.455; see Gonz\u00e1lez Vila 1975:\n28\u201330).\n\nPereira\u2019s nominalist position rests on this basis. The question\nof whether universals are or not substances is elucidated by\nexplaining the universal concept as a connotative term which exists\nonly in the sentences formulated by our own mind. The soul understands\nthat the singular elements that can constitute a genus or a species\nhave similar characteristics, and thus it regards them all as a unity\nand this unity as a universal concept. Applying this doctrine, Pereira\ndirected his criticism to certain metaphysical concepts that were\nmeaningless and unnecessary for him. Such is the case, for example, of\nthe scholastic difference between essence and existence. Against St.\nThomas, he affirmed that these two concepts are not different\nrealiter but only conceptually, and this because \n\n\u2026 aut essentia erit ens, et sic ens et essentia non\ndistinguentur, quod probare nisi sumus. Aut non erit ens, et sic non\nens intrasset entis compositionem, quod implicat. (AM: I.490)\n\nThat is:\n\n\u2026 either essence will be a being, and thus a being and essence\nwill not be different from one another, (which [we cannot] prove\nunless we exist) or it will not be a being, and thus a being would not\nhave entered the make-up of the thing it is embracing. (AM: I.491)\n\n\nNor did G\u00f3mez Pereira accept the concept of prime matter. The\nprocedure which Aristotle followed to conceive this concept was none\nother than analogy, because prime matter is not accessible to the\nsenses. It is something that remains as an immutable subject in the\ntransition from one form to another one; for instance, if a new form\nmust be induced during the process of generation, then the natural\ndispositions required for the formation of the new living being must\nbe precedent and remain during all this process; those dispositions,\ninaccessible to sensory perception, are prime matter, which lacks any\npositive nature. Hence Aristotle pointed out in Metaphysics\nVII that it is not a quid or a quantum, or any other\ngenre of predicates (see Metaphysica, VII, 3,\n1029a6\u201329). Against this theory, the author of the Antoniana\nMargarita argued that in the process of natural generation it is\nobserved not only that the material part of the compound disappears,\nbut also the formal one, so if the sentence ex nihilo nihil\nfieri is adopted by the Aristotelians for affirming the necessary\npermanence of matter, the same should be said with respect to the\nform, since neither the form nor matter can turn into nothing or be\ngenerated from nothing: this means then that also the form would exist\nin a temporal continuum (AM: I.549). In Pereira\u2019s opinion, this\nproblem can be easily solved if we consider that the elements are the\nbasic materials of nature. They can perfectly play the role of matter,\nand there is no problem in the fact that the elements are also subject\nto mutation and even annihilation, because, ultimately, they are under\nthe influence of qualities which are contrary to their own\nconsistency: so when these qualities have a strong presence in them,\nthis always leads to their destruction; but, on the contrary, whenever\nthe primary qualities appear in the right proportion, the same\nelements are generated again.\n",
