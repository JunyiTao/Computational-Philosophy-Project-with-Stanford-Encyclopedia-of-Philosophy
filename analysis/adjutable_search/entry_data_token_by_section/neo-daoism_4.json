    "main_text": "Capacity and Nature, Words and Meaning, and the Debate on Naturalness\n6. Concluding Remarks\n\nIn the early fourth century, the Jin dynasty was forced to flee its\ncapital and to rebuild in south China. As the literati settled in a\nnew land, they looked back to the time of He Yan and Wang Bi as the\ngolden age of Xuanxue. Although Pure Conversation continued\nwith undiminished rigor, it did not introduce many new ideas. In the\nsouthern court, the senior statesman Wang Dao (276\u2013339) is\nreported to have said that he would only talk about \u201cnourishing\nlife,\u201d \u201cwords and meaning,\u201d and Ji Kang\u2019s\ntheory of music (Shishuo xinyu 4.21). Throughout the Jin\nperiod and beyond, as another early source relates, whether\n\u201csounds do not have sorrow or joy\u201d and the \u201cfour\nroots of capacity and nature\u201d remained the stuff of\nphilosophical discussion (Nan Qi shu [History of the Southern\nQi Dynasty] 33).\n\nAs Neo-Daoism entered its last phase, another Daoist work, the\nLiezi, came to rival the \u201cThree Great Works on the\nProfound.\u201d Zhang Zhan (ca. 330\u2013400) wrote an important\ncommentary on the work\u2014indeed, some would argue that Zhang had a\nhand in the formation of the Liezi itself\u2014in which he\nrecapitulated many of the ideas that spanned the entire spectrum of\nNeo-Daoist philosophy. What is of particular interest is that Zhang\nexplicitly introduced Buddhist ideas into Xuanxue.\n\nBuddhism had entered China long before the Jin period. Given the\nsimilarity between the Daoist concept of wu and the Buddhist\nemphasis on \u201cemptiness,\u201d it has been suggested that\nNeo-Daoism was influenced by Buddhist philosophy from the start.\nThough possible, there is so far no strong evidence linking He Yan,\nWang Bi and other early Neo-Daoists to Buddhism. On the contrary, it\nis clear that Xuanxue had exerted considerable influence on\nthe development of Chinese Buddhism. From the fourth century onward,\nBuddhist masters frequently engaged in Pure Conversation and\nchallenged Xuanxue scholars at their own game. For example,\nthe Shishuo xinyu (4.32) reports that the monk Zhi Dun\n(314\u2013366) challenged the \u201cXiang-Guo\u201d\u2014i.e.,\nXiang Xiu and Guo Xiang\u2014interpretation of the Zhuangzi,\narguing that only the enlightened sage could truly experience\ntranscendental freedom. In another episode, we find Zhi Dun taking\npart in a debate on the \u201cfour roots of capacity and\nnature\u201d (4.51). During the Northern and Southern Dynasties that\nfollowed the Jin, Xuanxue reached the pinnacle of its\ninfluence when it was admitted into the official curriculum of the\nimperial academy. At the same time, however, Neo-Daoism also began to\nlose its vitality. As the early medieval period drew to a close, it\nwas Buddhism and religious Daoism that commanded the attention of the\nliterati.\n\nXuanxue or Neo-Daoism occupies a key place in the history of\nChinese philosophy. Arriving on the Chinese scene at a point of\nrupture, it redefined the classical tradition and brought into\ncurrency new ideas in metaphysics, ethics, hermeneutics, and other\nareas of philosophical concern, which facilitated the reception of\nBuddhist philosophy and laid the foundation for the Neo-Confucian\nmovement later. To recapitulate, mainstream Neo-Daoism is not a\npartisan Daoist school. Properly understood, Confucius, Laozi, and\nZhuangzi converge in their understanding of Dao. Secondly,\nXuanxue cannot be divorced from the goal of \u201cgreat\npeace.\u201d The philosophy of nothingness and naturalness does not\ngive rise to pessimism or renunciation. Even Ji Kang and Ruan Ji did\nnot abandon the promise of renewal. Although many scholars had found\nin the figure of the ancient recluse a source of inspiration, and\ndespite the fact that it was common for the literati to refuse office,\nthere was an optimism that naturalness and nonaction would in the end\nbring about harmony and peace. Finally, it should be emphasized that\nNeo-Daoism is not monolithic. The concept of nothingness, for example,\nmay have been central to the Xuanxue project, but it is\nsubject to debate and interpretation. Toward the end of the third\ncentury, for example, Pei Wei (267\u2013300) composed a treatise\nprovocatively titled \u201cExtoling [the Philosophical Primacy of]\nBeing\u201d (Chongyou lun), which should give an indication\nof the vibrancy of the Learning in the Profound.\n",
