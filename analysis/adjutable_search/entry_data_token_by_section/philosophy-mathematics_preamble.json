    "main_text": "\n\nIf mathematics is regarded as a science, then the philosophy of\nmathematics can be regarded as a branch of the philosophy of science,\nnext to disciplines such as the philosophy of physics and the\nphilosophy of biology. However, because of its subject matter, the\nphilosophy of mathematics occupies a special place in the philosophy\nof science. Whereas the natural sciences investigate entities that are\nlocated in space and time, it is not at all obvious that this is also\nthe case for the objects that are studied in mathematics. In addition\nto that, the methods of investigation of mathematics differ markedly\nfrom the methods of investigation in the natural sciences. Whereas the\nlatter acquire general knowledge using inductive methods, mathematical\nknowledge appears to be acquired in a different way: by deduction from\nbasic principles. The status of mathematical knowledge also appears to\ndiffer from the status of knowledge in the natural sciences. The\ntheories of the natural sciences appear to be less certain and more\nopen to revision than mathematical theories. For these reasons\nmathematics poses problems of a quite distinctive kind for philosophy.\nTherefore philosophers have accorded special attention to ontological\nand epistemological questions concerning mathematics.\n",
