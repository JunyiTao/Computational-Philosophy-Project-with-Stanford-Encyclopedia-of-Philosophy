    "main_text": "Philosophical ideas || Psychology\n5. Influence\nBecause of all these differences between Plotinus and the Arabic Plotinus\u2014and only a few of the most important have been mentioned here\u2014it is worth bearing in mind that it was this reworked version used by later authors in the Arabic tradition. In light of the Aristotelianizing tendencies of the Arabic version, it is appropriate that the Theology is cited in the Harmony of the Two Sages, Plato and Aristotle, a work ascribed to al-Farabi. The Harmony cites the Theology in support of the compatibility of Platonic and Aristotelian metaphysics, on the issues of the a-temporal creation of the universe and the existence of Platonic Forms (Adamson 2021). When al-Farabi refers here to the Theology, he evidently has in mind a more capacious work than our Theology of Aristotle, because he includes propositions from the Arabic Proclus under this title.\nWhether or not the Theology was by Aristotle, it was destined to become the key source for Neoplatonic ideas in Arabic. We see its influence over a period of many centuries, starting immediately with other versions of Greek texts produced in the ninth century. As mentioned above (\u00a73) it was a chief influence on the Book of Causes, the Kindi circle adaptation of Proclus\u2019 Elements of Theology. It also seems to have influenced the roughly contemporaneous version of Aristotle\u2019s De Anima, and the treatment of the soul\u2019s immateriality by the ninth-century Christian author Qus\u1e6d\u0101 Ibn L\u016bq\u0101 (Giommoni 2019).\nThe high-water mark of its influence may have been the tenth century, about one century after it was probably written. During this period, several Isma\u2018ili authors, such as Abu Ya\u2018qub al-Sijistani and al-Kirmani, adapt Plotinus\u2019 hierarchy for their own Neoplatonizing metaphysics, and associate the levels of the hierarchy with elements of Islamic theology. Al-Sijistani goes the negative theology of the Arabic Plotinus one better, insisting that when speaking of God we must negate even negation (see further Walker 2005). Around the same time, Neoplatonic authors like al-\u2018Amiri and Miskawayh were influenced, directly or indirectly, by the Arabic Plotinus. The Shorter Healing (al-Fawz al-Asghar) of Miskawayh is full of terminology and doctrine from the Arabic Plotinus (see Adamson 2007b), and a compilation of philosophical material produced in his circle draws on the text too (Wakelnig 2014). Al-\u2018Amiri, meanwhile, is one of the authors to transmit the Plotinian version of materials from Proclus (see Wakelnig 2006). Neoplatonic ideas related to our text also appear in authors like Abu Sulayman al-Sijistani and his circle (on whom see Kraemer 1986). Somewhat earlier in the tenth century the Jewish philosopher Isaac Israeli drew on the Arabic Plotinus, as well as works by al-Kindi himself (see Altmann and Stern 1958).\nPerhaps during this same period, a text was written which re-worked the Theology much in the way that the Theology re-worked Plotinus. This is the so-called \u2018Long Version\u2019 of the Theology, which may emanate from an Isma\u2018ili context. It introduces yet further philosophical ideas to the text, postulating for instance a logos or \u2018word\u2019 that mediates between God and the first intellect. (On the Longer Version see Stern 1983, Fenton 1986 and Zimmermann 1986.) The Longer Version was the basis for the Latin translation of the Theology, which was produced in the sixteenth century.\nContrary to what one might expect, the Theology\u2019s status as an Aristotelian work was not necessarily the key to its influence and transmission. Avicenna, for instance, expressed some doubt as to its authenticity, yet he also composed a set of notes commenting on the text. These are based on our shorter version (for the notes see Badawi 1947, 37\u201384, translated into French in Vajda 1951 and discussed in Adamson 2004a and 2004b). The text went on to be influential in post-Avicennan philosophy. The twelfth-century thinker Suhrawardi ascribes material clearly drawn from the Theology to Plato, most likely because Plato is prominently mentioned in the Theology itself, at the end of the first chapter (D\u2019Ancona 2004). Slightly later, the twelfth-thirteenth century author \u2018Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi provides us with the chief evidence for the original \u2018metaphysics file\u2019 that contained the Arabic Plotinus (see Zimmermann 1986 and above, \u00a73). He paraphrased several works from this collection including the Book of Causes (see further Martini Bonadeo 2013).\nFinally, we can mention the influence of the Theology in the Safavid period. Many of our manuscripts of the work were produced in Iran under the Safavids and Qajars. It seems to have been read eagerly from early in the Safavid age, as we can tell from a preface added to the text by the important early sixteenth-century philosopher Ghiyat-al-Din Dashtaki, who may also have written a commentary to the text (Di Branco 2014). It was also used by al-Nayrizi, a student of Dashtaki (on him see Pourjavady 2011). Commentaries to the text were written by later Safavid thinkers: the famous Mulla Sadra (for a work drawing on the Arabic Plotinus see Nasr 2014), and the seventeenth century by Sa\u2018id al-Qummi (for the latter see Rizvi 2007).\n",
