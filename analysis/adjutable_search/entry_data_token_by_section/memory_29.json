    "main_text": "The Ethics of Memory || The duty to remember\n10.2 The duty to remember\n\nSome researchers have argued that we may have a moral duty to\nremember. Margalit (2002), for example, argues that we have a\nduty to remember the victims of radical evil. Such an\nobligation\u2014which, as Blustein (2008) points out,\nmight hold either at the individual or the collective\nlevel\u2014would be consistent with the spirit behind\ntruth and reconciliation commissions and similar institutions (Neumann\n& Thompson 2015). But the existence of a duty to\nremember is controversial, with some maintaining that there is no general\nduty to remember the past and even that there may in some cases be a duty\nto forget (Rieff 2016).\n",
