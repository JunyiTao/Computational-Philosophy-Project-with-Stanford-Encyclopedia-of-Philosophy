    "main_text": "\n1. Different Kinds of Luck\n\nLuck is a pervasive feature of human life (Williams 1981, 21). It\nappears to arise in (at least) four main ways (Nagel 1979; Statman\n1993, 11). First, the outcomes of our actions are affected by luck\n(resultant luck). Some months before the Russian invasion of Ukraine\nin 2022, it may have seemed prudent to invest in stocks. Someone who\ndid so may rightly see the ensuing reduction of her wealth as bad\nresultant luck. Second, the circumstances in which one acts introduce\nluck (circumstantial luck). A person who is offered proper incentives\nand plenty of time to deliberate may make a wiser decision than she\nwould under less favorable conditions; it may be by accident that she\nfinds herself in the favorable conditions and hence makes the wiser\ndecision (but see Pritchard 2005, 254\u2013261). Third, luck affects\nthe kind of person you are (constitutive luck). Genetically, some\npeople are at greater risk of cancer through smoking than others, and\nbecause of this it makes sense to say that some smokers are lucky to\navoid cancer. Finally, there is luck in the way one\u2019s actions\nare determined by antecedent circumstances (antecedent causal luck).\nChildren who grow up in a stimulating environment perhaps become more\nmotivated than they would in a duller setting; yet children rarely\ndetermine the time and place in which they are raised. When we add up\nresultant, circumstantial, constitutive, and antecedent causal luck,\nthe area of life that is free of luck seems to shrink \u201cto an\nextensionless point\u201d (Nagel 1979, 35; compare Parfit 1995,\n10\u201312; Lang 2021; Levy 2014).\n\nLuck that does not affect a person\u2019s interests is irrelevant\nfrom the point of view of justice. But luck that does\u2014whether\nthe interests are characterized in terms of welfare, resources,\nopportunities, capabilities to achieve functionings, or in some other\nway\u2014certainly seems relevant. People who end up less well (or\nbetter) off than others as a result of luck often ask \u201cWhy\nme?\u201d (Otsuka 2004, 151\u2013152). For instance, many affluent\npeople, reflecting on the situation of poor people in poor countries,\nwould be inclined to think that it is simply the latter\u2019s bad\nluck to have been born in such countries. They would further assume\nthat it is their own good luck to have been born in affluent\ncountries, that they do not deserve their favorable starting position,\nand that this makes the inequality unjust. If those who live in poor\ncountries were in the situation they find themselves in through their\nown fault, and not victims of bad luck, no question of distributive\njustice would arise. But they are not, and it seems unfair and unjust\nthat some people\u2019s prospects are worse than others\u2019 simply\nin virtue of birthplace (Caney 2005, 122; for opposing considerations\nsee Miller 2007, 56\u201375). The underlying assumption seems to be\nthat luck-affected differential standings are morally undesirable or\nunjust (Arneson 1989, 85; Tan 2012, 149\u2013185; Temkin 1993, 200);\nbut this assumption calls for philosophical clarification. Given the\npervasiveness of luck, such clarification appears to be required\nwhenever people end up unequally well off.\n2. Distributive Justice\n\nIt is commonplace to distinguish between retributive justice and\ndistributive justice. In both cases the issue of bad luck arises, and\noffhand it seems that the role one ascribes to luck in one area will\nconstrain the role one can ascribe to luck elsewhere: if luck raises\nquestions about the significance of desert in the sphere of\ndistributive justice, it will probably have similar repercussions\nvis-a-vis desert and retributive justice (Sandel 1982, 91\u201392;\nScheffler 1992, 306). In the present entry, however, we shall focus on\nrelations between luck and distributive justice.\n\nIn fact it will be useful to narrow the focus further to a particular\nfamily of theories of distributive justice\u2014namely, those\ninvolving an end-result principle of justice (Nozick 1974,\n153\u2013155). End-result principles entail that one can judge\nwhether a certain distribution of goods is desirable without knowing\nhow it came about. The following are well-known principles of this\nkind and/or theories giving a central role to them. (a) Crude\negalitarianism, given which it is bad or unjust if some people are\nworse off than others. (b) Crude sufficientarianism, given which it is\nbad or unjust if some people do not have enough of whatever is the\nrelevant currency of distributive justice (Frankfurt 1988,\n134\u2013158; see also Axelsen and Nielsen 2015; Casal 2007; Huseby\n2010; Shields 2012, 2016). (c) Prioritarianism, given which we should\nmaximize the sum of welfare that is weighted to ensure that benefits\nat lower levels of welfare have more weight than those at higher\nlevels (Holtug 2010, 202\u2013243; Adler and Holtug 2019). (d) The\ndifference principle, given which it is unjust if the worst off are\nless well off than they could be. (Strictly speaking, Rawls himself\nsays that the difference principle applies to the basic structure of\nsociety (Scheffler 2006, 102\u2013110; compare Cohen 2000,\n134\u2013147; Cohen 2008, 116\u2013180), so for Rawls it applies\nonly indirectly to outcomes. On this understanding, the difference\nprinciple is not, in any straightforward sense, an end-state\nprinciple. Here we prefer to treat the difference principle as one\nthat applies directly to outcomes.) Finally, there is (e)\nutilitarianism, given which we should maximize the sum of welfare.\n\nThere are two reasons for narrowing the focus in this way. First, some\nend-result principles have been defended on the basis of\nconsiderations about luck. Thus it is often suggested that\nconsiderations about neutralizing luck favor the difference principle\nover \u2018historical\u2019 principles of justice, i.e., principles\ndefining justice in terms of the way a distribution of goods comes\nabout. No such suggestion has been made on behalf of non-end-result\nprinciples. Take Nozick\u2019s entitlement view. On this view, it may\nbe a matter of luck what people are entitled to, and yet Nozick\nexplicitly claims that this does not erode the relevant entitlements\n(Nozick 1974, 225). Second, many have inserted into end-result\nprinciples clauses that allow for deviations from the prescribed\nend-result provided that these deviations do not reflect luck. For\ninstance, most contemporary egalitarians believe that an unequal\ndistribution that is not a matter of bad luck for the worse off could\nbe just. Luck plays no comparable role in historical principles. The\nimportant conceptual point is that, as Arneson puts it, we should\ndistinguish the \u201cluckist\u201d element in a theory of\ndistributive justice from the end-result favored by the theory, when\nsetting aside \u201cluckist\u201d concerns (Arneson 2006;\nLippert-Rasmussen 2018; for different views on how these two\ncomponents (do not) cohere, see Miller 2015; Elford 2017).\n\nJohn Rawls\u2019 work explains why the concept of luck has had a\ncentral place in discussions of justice over the last 40 years. In an\nimmensely influential section of his A Theory of Justice he\nintroduced the metaphors of the social and natural lotteries (for a\nbrief overview over Rawls\u2019 appeal to luck and the legacy of this\nappeal, see Knight and Stemplowska 2011, 2\u20139). The underlying\nidea is that every person\u2019s starting point in society is the\noutcome of a social lottery (the political, social, and economic\ncircumstances into which each person is born) and a natural lottery\n(the biological potentials each person is born with). Rawls says that\nthe outcome of each of person\u2019s social and natural lottery is,\nlike the outcomes of ordinary lotteries, a matter of good or bad\n\u201cfortune\u201d or \u201cluck\u201d (Rawls 1971, 74, 75).\nHence, since one cannot possibly merit, or deserve, an outcome of this\nkind, people\u2019s starting positions cannot be justified by appeal\nto merit or desert (Rawls 1971, 7, 104). It can be seen, then, that\nRawls\u2019 social and natural lotteries provide negative support for\nhis theory of justice. They undermine alternative theories in which\ndistributions of social and economic benefits deviating from that\nprescribed by the difference principle are tolerated (Nozick 1974,\n216; Arneson 2001, 76). They also underpin Rawls\u2019 claim that a\nsystem of natural liberty\u2014one in which formal equality of\nopportunity obtains in that \u201call have at least the same legal\nrights to all advantaged social positions\u201d (Rawls 1971, 72) and\napplicants are assessed on their merits alone\u2014is unjust because\n\u201cit permits distributive shares to be improperly influenced\nby\u201d the outcomes of the social and natural lottery.\n\nLuck also plays an important positive role in Rawls\u2019 work. Since\nwe can regard people\u2019s natural talents as a matter of luck, it\nis appropriate, Rawls thinks, to regard their distribution as a\n\u201ccommon asset and to share in the benefits of this distribution\nwhatever it turns out to be.\u201d This means that \u201c[t]hose who\nhave been favored by nature\u2026. may gain from their good fortune\nonly on terms that improve the situation of those who have lost\nout\u201d (Rawls 1971, 101 \u2013 this point is put somewhat less\nstrongly in the second edition of A Theory of Justice). This\nis exactly what the difference principle, in one of its versions,\nsays.  Moreover, if we assume an independently plausible principle of\nredress which says that \u201cundeserved inequalities\u2026 are to\nbe compensated for\u201d, and if people\u2019s lives are shaped by\nundeserved outcomes of the social and the natural lottery, then we can\nsay that the difference principle \u201cdoes achieve some of the\nintent of the [principle of redress]\u201d (Rawls 1971, 101). (While\nit is undeniable that luck plays a role in A Theory of\nJustice, and that the considerations described above are\ncongenial to luck-egalitarians, some commentators argue that this role\nis exaggerated and misconceived when Rawls is understood in\nluck-egalitarian fashion (Scheffler 2003, 8\u201312, 24\u201331;\nScheffler 2005; Scheffler 2006; Freeman 2007, 111\u2013142; Mandle\n2009, 24\u201329; Forst 2020). In Section 8, we ask whether the\nluck-neutralizing aim can play a positive role in justifying equality,\nan issue that is, of course, distinct from the question whether it has\nbeen widely thought to be capable of playing such a role.)\n\nLuck has been examined closely in the writings of successive\negalitarians (Arneson 1989; Arneson 2011; Cohen 2008; Cohen 2011;\nDworkin 2000; Nagel 1991; Rakowski 1991; Roemer 1993; Roemer 1996;\nRoemer 1998; Temkin 1993). (While the philosophers mentioned here are\noften referred to as \u201cluck egalitarians\u201d, not all of them\nfavor this label (e.g., Dworkin 2003, 192; cp. Arneson 2018)). Ronald\nDworkin holds that differences in wealth generated by differences\n\u201ctraceable to genetic luck\u201d (Dworkin 2000, 92) are unfair.\nHe describes a hypothetical insurance device which, on the one hand,\nneutralizes \u201cthe effects of differential talents\u201d (Dworkin\n2000, 91) and, on the other hand, is insensitive to the different\nambitions people have in their lives (Kymlicka 2002, 75\u201379).\nSimilarly, G. A. Cohen writes that \u201canyone who thinks that\ninitial advantage and inherent capacity are unjust distributors thinks\nso because he believes that they make a person\u2019s fate depend too\nmuch on sheer luck\u201d (Cohen 2011, 30). In his view, \u201cthe\nfundamental distinction for an egalitarian is between choice and luck\nin the shaping of people\u2019s fates\u201d (Cohen 2011, 4).\n\nGenerally speaking, sufficientarians do not incorporate a\n\u201cluckist\u201d element into their views about distributive\njustice (see, however, Casal 2007, 322). A sufficientarian theory that\ndoes so might say, e.g., that it is unjust if some people do not have\nenough through no fault or choice of their own\n(\u201cluck-sufficientarianism\u201d, we might call this view). The\nreason sufficientarians tend not to endorse some such view is that\nthey believe that people are entitled to a certain minimum, however\nthey exercise their responsibility.\n\nLuck is also appealed to by some who believe that benefits matter\nmore, morally speaking, the worse off those to whom the benefits\naccrue are. Thus Richard J. Arneson has defended a version of\nprioritarianism accommodating the \u201cgeneric egalitarian\nintuition\u201d that \u201cfortunate individuals should give up\nresources to improve the life prospects of those whose initial\nconditions are unpropitious [i.e., the upshot of bad luck]\u201d\n(Arneson 1999, 227). According to this view, \u201cthe moral value of\nachieving a gain (avoiding a loss) for a person\u201d is\n\u201cgreater, the lower the person\u2019s lifetime expectation of\nwell-being prior to receipt of the benefit (avoidance of the\nloss)\u201d and \u201cgreater, the larger the degree to which the\nperson deserves this gain (loss avoidance)\u201d (Arneson 1999,\n239\u2013240).\n\nFinally, while no one has argued that utilitarianism is grounded in\nreflections on luck, it has certainly been argued that non-luck\nconsiderations qualify our obligation to maximize welfare.\nFred Feldman, for instance, defends a version of consequentialism that\nadjusts utility for justice on the basis that a pleasure is more\nvaluable if it is deserved and less valuable, or perhaps even\ndisvaluable, if it is undeserved (Feldman 1997). Given an appropriate\naccount of desert, this position might be looked upon as\nluck-utilitarianism (or luck-consequentialism). On one version of this\nkind of view (one differing from Feldman\u2019s), the moral value of\nan outcome always increases with increasing welfare for individuals.\nBut as is the case with Arneson\u2019s responsibility-sensitive\nprioritarianism, on this view the moral value of an extra unit of\nwelfare to a person is \u201cgreater, the larger the degree to which\nthe person deserves this gain (loss avoidance).\u201d\n3. Thin Luck\n\nThe concept of luck is a curious one (Dennett 1984, 92; see also\nPritchard 2005, 125\u2013133; Pritchard and Whittington 2015). To\navoid various pitfalls, it helps to distinguish thin and thick notions\nof luck (as suggested by Hurley 2002, 79\u201380; Hurley 2003,\n107\u2013109; Vallentyne 2006, 434). To say that\nsomething\u2014whether a choice or an outcome (other than choice)\n(Olsaretti 2009; Scheffler 2003, 18\u201319)\u2014is a matter of\nthin luck for someone is to say merely that this person does\nnot stand in a certain moral relationship to a certain object, where\nsuch moral relationship essentially involves this individual in his or\nher capacity as a rational agent. To say that something is a matter of\nthick luck is to say this and to commit oneself to a certain\naccount of the non-moral properties in virtue of which this moral\nrelationship obtains. Accordingly, a thick concept of luck is a more\nspecific version of the corresponding thin concept of luck. In either\ncase, to say that something is a matter of luck for someone, in the\nsense of \u201cluck\u201d that is relevant to justice, is to imply\nthat it affects this person\u2019s interests for good or bad (see,\nhowever, Sher\u2019s discussion (2014, 20\u201334) of whether the\nrelevant objection to luck applies to people\u2019s absolute or\ncomparative distributive positions).\n\nThere are several varieties of thin notions of luck. One is the\nfollowing kind of responsibility luck:\n\nY is a matter of luck for X if, and only if,\nX is not morally responsible for Y.\n\n\nIn this definition, like those set out below, \u201cX\u201d\nranges over individuals and \u201cY\u201d ranges over items\nthat can be a matter of luck for an individual, e.g., events, states\nof affairs, personality traits, actions, omissions, and much else. A\nnumber of views about what makes an agent responsible for something\nhave been taken (for overviews, see Matravers 2007, 14\u201364;\nTalbert 2019). On responsibility for actions (and omissions), (a) some\nemphasize the role of the ability to act otherwise (Ayer 1982; Moore\n1912), (b) others focus on whether an act is appropriately related to\nthe agent\u2019s real self (Frankfurt 1988; Watson 1982), and (c) yet\nothers think that what matters is whether the agent acted from a\nsuitable reasons-sensitive mechanism (Fischer and Ravizza 1998;\nFischer 2006). To say that an outcome conforms to (1) is to remain\nneutral on which of these accounts is correct. (It has become common\nto distinguish between attributive and substantive responsibility\n(Scanlon 1999, 248\u2013251; Scanlon 2006, 72\u201380). The former\nconcerns what comprises a suitable basis for moral appraisal of an\nagent. The latter concerns what people are required to do for one\nanother. While the issue of luck arises in relation to both senses of\nresponsibility, ultimately it is the latter which, ultimately, is\ncrucial to distributive justice, even though moral appraisal of people\nand their actions might have implications for what they owe one\nanother.)\n\nThin notions of luck need not be notions of responsibility luck. Thus\nthe following notion of desert luck is thin:\n\nY is a matter of thin luck for X if, and only\nif, it is not the case that X deserves Y.\n\n\nAs with responsibility, a number of views about what makes an agent\ndeserving are possible (Kagan 2012, 6\u20137; Sher 1987, 7). Some\naccounts hold the basis of desert to be the value of one\u2019s\ncontribution, while others hold the desert basis to be one\u2019s\nlevel of effort. People who think that justice should neutralize the\nluck specified by (2) can disagree over these accounts.\n\nIt is worth emphasizing that thin responsibility luck and thin desert\nluck are independent of one another. First, X may be\nresponsible for Y and yet not deserve Y. Thus a man\nwho heroically throws himself on to a grenade to save his comrades,\nthereby losing his life, is responsible for his own death\u2014indeed\nthis is what makes his act praiseworthy\u2014even if he did not\ndeserve to die. Second, X may deserve Y without\nbeing responsible for Y. Thus a poor saint who stumbles,\nentirely fortuitously, upon a gold nugget might deserve (in the wider\nscheme of things) to be enriched by his discovery even though he is\nnot responsible for making it.\n\nOther thin notions of luck can be described, but thin desert luck and\n(especially) thin responsibility luck have received the lion\u2019s\nshare of attention in the literature on distributive justice. While\nclearly different, they are occasionally conflated (as pointed out in\nHurley 2003, 191\u201395).\n4. Thick Luck\n\nThe claim that something is a matter of thin responsibility luck can\nbe combined with various accounts of responsibility and thus various\naccounts of luck. It is these latter accounts\u2014thick\naccounts of responsibility luck\u2014that tell us what makes a person\nresponsible for something. On the thick, control-based account of\nresponsibility luck:\n\nY is a matter of luck for X if, and only if, (i)\nX is not responsible for Y; and (ii) X is\nnot responsible for Y if, and only if, X does not\nand did not control Y (Otsuka 2002, 40; Sher 2014,\n22\u201323; Zimmerman 1993, 219).\n\n\nA competing thick, choice-based account of responsibility luck\nsays:\n\nY is a matter of luck for X if, and only if, (i)\nX is not responsible for Y; and (ii) X is\nnot responsible for Y if, and only if, Y is not, in\nan appropriate way, the result of a choice made by X (cf.\nCohen 2011, 13).\n\n\nTo see how these control-based and choice-based notions diverge,\nconsider a Frankfurtian scenario in which Y comes about as a\nresult of X\u2019s choice, but X did not control\nwhether Y came about because had X not chosen to\nbring about Y, then Y would have been realized\nthrough some alternative causal means (Frankfurt 1988). Conversely, in\na case in which X fails to make up his mind whether to\nprevent Y coming about and then finds he can no longer\ncontrol the outcome, it might be said that Y does not come\nabout as a result of X\u2019s choice even if X\ncontrolled Y.\n\nOften it makes a crucial difference which items Y ranges over\n(see Cohen 2011, 25, 93; Price 1999). Suppose, for instance, that a\nperson deliberately, and in full control, cultivates a preference for\nspending leisure hours driving about in her car reasonably foreseeing\nthat the prices of gas will stay low (Arneson 1990, 186).\nUnfortunately, and unpredictably, the price of gas skyrockets and her\npreference becomes very costly. In this case, the fact that this\nperson prefers to spend her leisure hours driving her car is neither\nbad control luck, nor bad choice luck. However, the fact that she is\nworse off as a result of her preference may be both, since she neither\nchose to act in such way to make this fact obtain, nor controlled\nwhether it did. We might say of this person that she had \u201cbad\nprice luck\u201d\n\nIt has been argued that both the control-based and choice-based thick\nnotions of luck are too broad. Most people neither control nor choose\ntheir religion, yet it seems odd to ask for compensation for feelings\nof guilt engendered by religious belief on the grounds that it is a\nmatter of bad luck that one holds those beliefs (Scanlon 1975; Cohen\n2011, 33\u201337). To accommodate this intuition G. A. Cohen\nintroduces the notion of counterfactual choice. One can\nexplain this notion with the following claim:\n\nY is a matter of luck for X if, and only if, (i)\nX is not responsible for Y; and (ii) X is\nnot responsible for Y if, and only if, Y is not the\nresult of a choice made by X and X would not choose\nY if X could.\n\n\nGiven the opportunity to do so, the theist would not choose to be free\nof the feelings of guilt engendered by his religious convictions.\nTherefore, it is not a matter of luck that he has such feelings and so\njustice does not require him to be compensated for the feelings. As\nCohen says, the costs of the unchosen and uncontrolled commitments of\nthe religious believer \u201care so intrinsically connected with his\ncommitments that they\u201d are not bad luck (Cohen 2011, 36; compare\nCohen 2011, 88; Sher 2014, 64\u201366).\n\nJust as there are different accounts of thick responsibility luck,\nthere are different accounts of thick desert luck (for a recent\ndiscussion of the relation between luck egalitarianism and desert, see\nBrouwer and Mulligan 2019). These correspond to competing accounts of\nthe basis of desert. One notion is that of thick, non-comparative\ndesert luck, which can be elaborated as follows:\n\nY is a matter of luck for X if, and only if, (i)\nit is not the case that X deserves Y; and (ii)\nX deserves Y if, and only if, it is fitting that\nX has Y given the moral or prudential merits of\nX.\n\n\nThe notion fleshed out here contrasts with that of thick, comparative\ndesert luck:\n\nY is a matter of luck for X if, and only if, (i)\nit is not the case that X deserves Y; and (ii)\nX deserves Y if, and only if, it is fitting that\nX has Y given the relative moral or prudential\nmerits of X and Z and given what Z\nhas.\n\n\nIt may be a matter of bad thick, non-comparative desert luck that the\ncrops of a talented, hard-working farmer are destroyed by cold\nweather. If, however, the crops of a farmer who is even more\nhard-working and talented are also destroyed, it will not be a matter\nof bad thick, comparative desert luck that the first farmer\u2019s\ncrops are destroyed.\n\nThe list of thick notions of luck mentioned so far is not intended to\nbe exhaustive, and each notion may of course be developed in several\ndirections. Clearly, thick luck is quite complex.\n5. Independent Notions of Luck\n\nSome accounts of luck are neither thin accounts of luck nor aim at\ncapturing a general moral notion such as responsibility or desert.\nInstead they appeal to an independent conception of luck. Lottery luck\nis arguably one example:\n\nY is a matter of luck for X if Y, from\nthe perspective of X, is the outcome of a lottery.\n\n\nThe underlying idea here is that there is a sense in which the outcome\nof a (fair) lottery is a matter of luck for the person who\nparticipates in it whether or not he is responsible for it\u2014as\nsome accounts of responsibility imply and others do not. It can be\nmaintained that justice is concerned with this notion of luck\nindependently of how it relates to responsibility and desert. Thus an\negalitarian may think that it is bad if people are unequally well off\nas a result of differential lottery luck even if he has not made up\nhis mind whether people are responsible for differential lottery luck.\nHe might add that it would be illegitimate for the state to enforce\nequality in face of inequality resulting from a fair lottery to which\nall parties consented. Also, lotteries might be excellent means of\nmaking outcomes independent of the unjust biases of distributors\n(compare Stone 2007, 286\u2013287), even if outcomes might be unjust\ndespite the fact such biases played no role in their genesis.\n\nIn principle, one could also care about choice and control luck\nindependently of how these relate to thin luck, e.g., responsibility\nand desert. However, philosophers who think that justice is a matter\nof eliminating differential luck have studied choice and control\nmainly because they assume that the absence of choice and control\nnullifies responsibility or desert.\n6. How Much Luck is There?\n\nAccounts of responsibility or desert affect how much luck there is in\nthe world. If, on the one hand, one accepts a hard deterministic\naccount of responsibility, everything is a matter of responsibility\nluck. A hard deterministic account of responsibility says that\nresponsibility and determinism are incompatible, that determinism is\ntrue, and, hence, that no one is ever responsible for anything. Most\nbelieve that, if hard determinism is true, extensionally speaking,\nluck-egalitarianism collapses into straight equality of outcome (e.g.,\nSmilansky 1997, 156; but see Stemplowska 2008). If, on the other hand,\none accepts a compatibilist, reason responsiveness account of\nresponsibility, many outcomes will not be a matter of responsibility\nluck, at least for some agents. A compatibilist, reason responsiveness\naccount of responsibility for outcomes says that an agent is\nresponsible for outcomes that he or she brings about in the right sort\nof way through the agent\u2019s actions (or omissions) where these\nissue from an action-generating process that is sufficiently sensitive\nto practical reasons, e.g., normal human deliberation, and that\nactions may issue from such mechanisms whether or not determinism\nobtains (Fischer and Ravizza 1998). Still, agents who act from reason\nresponsive mechanisms may face choice situations that differ much in\nterms of how favorable they are in which case inequalities reflecting\nsuch differences may not be just, even if they obtain between agents\nwho are responsible for the choices they made. For this reason (among\nothers), it is open for compatibilist luck-egalitarians to think that\nlittle inequality can be justified by differential exercises of choice\n(see Barry 2005).\n\nOne issue which has received quite a lot of attention in the debate\nabout justice and luck is the regression principle governing luck:\n\nIf the causes of Y are a matter of luck for X,\nso is Y.\n\n\nIf this principle is coupled with control or choice accounts of luck,\neverything turns into luck. For if we couple (9) with, say, the thick,\nchoice-based account of responsibility luck, it follows that for my\npresent reckless driving not to be a matter of (bad) luck, it will\nhave to be the case that I am responsible for, and hence have chosen,\nthe causes of my present reckless driving. In turn, for me to be\nresponsible for these causes I will in turn have to be responsible\nfor, and hence have chosen, the causes of these causes of my reckless\ndriving; and so on. Obviously, at some point, moving back through the\ncausal chain (e.g., prior to my coming into existence, if not long\nbefore that), choice, and thus responsibility, will peter out. So it\nwill follow that I am not responsible for my present reckless driving:\nit is my bad luck that I drive my car in a totally irresponsible way.\nGeneralizing this sort of reasoning, no one would ever be responsible\nfor anything\u2014that everything would be a matter of responsibility\nluck. As Thomas Nagel writes \u201cEverything seems to result from\nthe combined influence of factors, antecedent and posterior to action,\nthat are not within the agent\u2019s control. Since he cannot be\nresponsible for them, he cannot be responsible for their\nresults\u201d (Nagel 1979, 35; compare Strawson 1994; Watson 2006,\n428).\n\nThe view that everything is a matter of responsibility (and desert)\nluck obviously flies in the face of our everyday ascriptions of\nresponsibility. Accordingly, this implication of the regression\nprinciple is often deployed in a corresponding reductio ad absurdum\n(Hurley 1993, 183; Hurley 2003; Nozick 1974, 225; Sher 1997,\n67\u201369; Zaitchik 1977, 371\u2013373). However, this reductio is\nperhaps too hasty. It has been argued that the principle (applied to\ncontrol) is not simply a matter of \u201cgeneralization from certain\nclear cases.\u201d Rather, it is a condition that we \u201care\nactually being persuaded\u201d is correct when we apply it to cases\n\u201cbeyond the original set\u201d, where, on reflection, we find\nthat \u201ccontrol is absent\u201d (Nagel 1979, 26\u201327). If\nthis is right, it seems we need an alternative explanation of why\nmoral responsibility is absent in those cases where control of causes\nis absent. So, for instance, if we agree that a person who offends, as\nan adult, as a result of childhood deprivation is not responsible for\nhis action, we need to explain what, here, nullifies responsibility if\nnot lack of control over causes of the agent\u2019s actions. That is,\nwe need to explain why certain kinds of causal background to action\nthreaten control while others do not even if we are dealing with cases\nwith the shared feature that the agent does not control the early\nparts of those causal backgrounds.\n\nAddressing this problem, Fischer and Ravizza suggest that a\n\u201cprocess of taking responsibility is necessary for moral\nresponsibility\u201d (Fischer and Ravizza 1998, 200). They add that,\nsince processes are necessarily historical, it follows that their\naccount of responsibility attends to an action\u2019s genesis or\norigins. With the same problem in mind, Susan Hurley suggests that\nresponsibility requires that the process \u201cby which\nreason-responsive mechanisms and self-perceptions in relation to these\nmechanisms are acquired\u201d (Hurley 2003, 51) is one in which the\nagent is equipped with mechanisms that are sufficiently responsive to\nobjective reasons (Hurley 2003, 51\u20132). That is, the reasons for\nwhich the agent acts must match the reasons for action that there in\nfact are sufficiently well, although this match need not be perfect.\nWhether either of these suggestions accommodates cases where,\ninitially, responsibility seems to be undermined by lack of control of\ncauses, remains to be seen. \n\nFor a brief discussion of the notion of constitutive luck see the\nfollowing supplementary document:\n Constitutive Luck.\n7. Option Luck Versus Brute Luck\n\nMost observers agree that not all bad luck is unjust.\nLuck-egalitarians, for example, often separate option luck and brute\nluck and deny that instances of differential option luck are\nunjust.\n\nCanonically, Ronald Dworkin explains option luck as follows:\n\u201cOption luck is a matter of how deliberate and calculated\ngambles turn out\u2014whether someone gains or loses through\naccepting an isolated risk he or she should have anticipated and might\nhave declined\u201d (Dworkin 2000, 73). Brute luck is \u201ca matter\nof how risks fall out that are not in that sense deliberate\ngambles\u201d (Dworkin 2000, 73). If I suddenly go blind as a result\nof a genetic condition, my brute luck is bad, but if I buy a lottery\nticket and win, my option luck is good.\n The availability of insurance provides a link between brute and\noption luck. For \u201cthe decision to buy or reject [\u2026]\ninsurance is a calculated gamble\u201d (Dworkin 2000, 74). This means\nthat a person may suffer bad brute luck, and for that reason end up\nworse off than others, and yet the resulting inequality might reflect\ndifferential option luck (see, however, Otsuka 2002, 43\u201351).\nRoughly, this will be so if the person who ends up worse off could\nhave insured against the sort of bad brute luck that she later\nsuffered but declined to do so (Dworkin 2000, 74, 77). So although it\nmay be bad brute luck that I suddenly go blind as a result of a\ngenetic condition, since the risk of this outcome happening is not one\nthat I \u201cmight have declined\u201d, the fact that I end up worse\noff as a result of going blind (if this occurs) will reflect bad\noption luck, since suitable insurance was available to me and,\naccordingly, I might have declined the risk of going blind, becoming\nbadly off as a result. (This is not to say that suitable insurance\nagainst the risk of becoming blind is possible. I am neither denying\nnor affirming that no amount of money can compensate one for the loss\nof one\u2019s ability to see; nor am I denying, or affirming, that\nalthough some, presumably large, amount of money can compensate one\nfor becoming blind, the required insurance policy will be unreasonably\nexpensive. If suitable insurance against the risk of becoming blind is\nnot possible or possible but unreasonably expensive, it follows that\nending up worse off as a result of this is, to some extent at least, a\nmatter of bad brute luck.)\n\nDworkin\u2019s distinction needs to be clarified, amended, and\nqualified in certain ways (Bognar 2019; Lippert-Rasmussen 2001;\nVallentyne 2002; Vallentyne 2008; Sandbu 2004, 294\u2013299: Otsuka\n2002, 45; Steiner 2002, 349; see also Dworkin 2002, 122\u2013125).\nFirst, consider a case where I can choose between two alternatives.\nOne involves a 75% chance of having one\u2019s crop destroyed by cold\nweather. The other one involves a 70% chance of having one\u2019s\ncrop destroyed by flooding. In one sense, obviously, either risk is\navoidable. Yet, if one were to go for the first alternative, and if\none\u2019s crops were destroyed by cold weather, it would seem odd to\nsay that the full extent to which one becomes worse off as a result of\nthat choice is a matter of bad option luck. After all, the chances of\nbecoming just as badly off via a different causal route, had I chosen\nthe other alternative, were almost as great. So it seems we should\noften think of a given piece of luck as a mixture of brute luck and\noption luck where the exact mixture depends on the extent to which one\ncould influence the expected value of the outcome of one\u2019s\nchoice (see Knight 2021). In the present case, I could only marginally\ninfluence the expected value of the outcome. Hence the disadvantages\nresulting from my choice should be seen as mostly a matter of bad\nbrute luck.\n\nSecond, suppose I am morally required to perform a certain action,\nsay, to save someone from a burning house thereby risking some\nmoderate burns in the process. Let us also suppose that I am worse off\nthan the person I save and that my doing so happens to make me even\nworse off than this person, since I do get burned in a way that\nrequires expensive medical attention. While the extra inequality that\nresults from my doing what I am morally required to do, on\nDworkin\u2019s definition, reflects bad option luck on my part, the\nview that the resulting extra inequality is in no way unjust is\nimplausible. In fact, the same conclusion would seem to apply to cases\nwhere the risk of severe burns is so high that one\u2019s\nintervention is supererogatory and one ends up worse off as a result\nof one\u2019s choosing to engage in a supererogatory rescue mission\n(Eyal 2007, 4; but see Lazenby 2010; Temkin 2003(b), 144).\n\nThird, suppose you and I face a prisoners\u2019 dilemma. I know that\nthere is some chance that you may defect in which case I will end up\nworse off. However, because I do not want to exploit you by defecting\nmyself in case you do not, I cooperate. As it happens you defect and I\nend up worse off. Again, since I am now worse off as a result of a\ncalculated gamble, I am worse off through bad option luck. Yet, it\nseems plausible to hold that the inequality that results from your\nexploiting my resistance to exploiting you is unjust\n(Lippert-Rasmussen 2011; for a different, but, related problem, see\nSeligman 2007).\n\nSetting aside refinements to it, in what way does Dworkin\u2019s\ndistinction matter from the point view of justice? We can split this\nquestion into two, one concerning brute luck and one concerning option\nluck (cp. Sher 2014, 1). Most egalitarians believe that justice\nrequires the nullification of all differential effects of brute luck\n(Cohen 2011, 5, 29; Rakowski 1991; for a critique, see\nElford 2013), feeling that it cannot be just that some people are\nworse off than others simply because they have been unfortunate, say,\nto have been born with bad genes. Not all egalitarians, however, take\nthis position. Peter Vallentyne believes that while it is true that\njustice requires compensation for congenital dispositions to develop\nserious diseases, this is because justice requires not the\nneutralization of bad brute luck but equality of initial prospects\n(Vallentyne 2002, 543). This equality obtains between two people when\nat some early stage in their development\u2014say, the time at which\nthey become sentient\u2014their prospects are equally good. A genetic\ndefect, at this point in time, would limit one\u2019s opportunities,\nand so such defects will often provide grounds for compensation.\nHowever, if two people face the same initial risk of developing\nmalaria and have equally good initial opportunities, justice does not\nrequire us to compensate the one who gets malaria as a result of bad\nbrute luck.\n\nIt is an advantage of Vallentyne\u2019s approach (over brute luck\nneutralizing egalitarianism) that it avoids the costs incurred in\nneutralizing the effects of differential brute luck. Of course, such\ncosts may lower everyone\u2019s ex ante prospects. Hence, brute luck\negalitarians are committed implausibly, in such cases, to worsening\neverybody\u2019s prospects\u2014or, at least, to saying that it\nwould be better to do so from the point of view of equality even if it\nmay not be better tout court. However, as Vallentyne concedes, initial\nequality of opportunity also raises problems. Suppose we live in a\ncaste society but make sure that babies are assigned starting\npositions in that society by a fair lottery. This society may well\nrealize initial equality of opportunity, yet it does not seem just\n(Barry 1989, 224n). Indeed, it is far from clear that the lottery\nreduces the injustice of this society at all.\n\nTurning now to option luck, three positions should be noted. First,\nsome believe that justice requires the differential effects of option\nluck not to be nullified. Dworkin takes this view (Dworkin 2000;\nRakowski 1991, 74; cp. Sher 2014, viii. Dworkin 2002, 114\u2013115\nseems to mitigate his Dworkin 2000 position). He thinks it would be\nunjust if the state were to compensate people who suffer bad option\nluck by taxing people who enjoy good option luck:\n\u201c\u2026people should pay the price of the life they have\ndecided to lead, measured in what others give up in order that they\ncan do so\u2026 But the price of a safer life, measured in this way,\nis precisely foregoing any chance of the gains whose prospect induces\nothers to gamble\u201d (Dworkin 2000, 74). Crucial to this claim is\nthe notion of the price of one\u2019s choices, one reason being that\nthis might vary considerably depending on the context within which\none\u2019s choice is made.\n\nOthers believe that justice permits but does not require the\nnullification of the effects of differential option luck. Peter\nVallentyne defends this position. According to him, justice requires\ninitial equality of opportunity, and this can be achieved through a\nscheme that provides equality of initial opportunities for advantage\nand no compensation for bad option outcome luck. However, initial\nequality of opportunity can also be achieved if the state, say, taxes\nall good option outcome luck (and all good brute luck) and compensates\nall bad option outcome luck (as well as all bad brute luck). This, in\neffect, will deprive people of the opportunity to gamble and hence\nensure that everyone ends up equally well off. In Vallentyne\u2019s\nview, the latter is required by justice when, and only when, this\nincreases the value of people\u2019s initial opportunities, and when\nthe scheme is introduced publicly and proactively so that people know\nthe rules of the game before it starts (Vallentyne 2002, 549, 555).\nThe first of these conditions may be met where people are very risk\naverse and the transaction costs involved in the tax scheme are not\nvery great.\n\nIn a third position, justice requires the nullification of some or all\neffects of differential option luck (e.g. Barry 2008). This view comes\nin several versions. In one, justice requires compensation in some but\nnot all cases of bad option luck. For instance, Marc Fleurbaey argues\nthat justice has a sufficientarian component such that it requires\ndifferential option luck outcomes where some people are left very\nbadly off to be eliminated. Suppose, for instance, that someone\ndecides to use his motorcycle without wearing a helmet, knowing the\nrisks involved, and ends up in a traffic accident in which he is\nseriously hurt as a result. According to Fleurbaey, justice requires\nus to help this person (Fleurbaey 1995, 40\u201341; Fleurbaey 2001,\n511; Fleurbaey 2008, 153\u2013198; see also Huseby 2018; Segall 2007;\nStemplowska 2009, 251\u2013254; Voigt 2007). Those attracted by\nDworkin\u2019s position on bad option luck will reply that we confuse\nan obligation of justice with an obligation of charity. It would be\nunfair for the motorcycle driver to impose costs on us simply because\nhe prefers to take the gamble of driving without helmet without\ninsurance. He should pay the price of his decisions (which, of course,\nis not to say that he deserves his bad fate). By contrast, friends of\nVallentyne\u2019s view might urge that there is nothing unjust about\na system that publicly and proactively declares that bad outcome\noption luck will be compensated by means of taxing away good option\nluck. Hence, while a refusal to assist the unlucky motorcyclist need\nnot be unjust, the imposition of assistance costs on others, under the\ncircumstances mentioned, would not be unjust either.\n\nA more extreme egalitarianism\u2014\u201call-luck\negalitarianism\u201d to use an apt phrase coined by Shlomi Segall\n(2010, 46; for a recent defense, see Knight 2021)\u2014has it that\n\u201cdifferential option luck should be considered as unjust as\ndifferential brute luck\u201d (Segall 2010, 47; cp. Segall 2013,\n64\u201382). For if what really drives egalitarians is the conviction\nthat people should not be worse off than others as a result of causes\nfor which they are not responsible, then, arguably, it follows that\ndifferential option luck is unjust. After all, a gambler is not\nresponsible for the outcome of her gamble being what it is rather than\nsomething else it could have been. This view does not commit its\nadvocates to the position that the state (or, for that matter, anyone\nelse) should prevent conduct that might lead to inequalities\nreflecting differential option luck: advocates of the view may care\nabout welfare too and rightly think that welfare is promoted when the\noutcomes of gambles are allowed to stand, or they might distinguish\nbetween legitimacy\u2014\u201cthe property something has when... no\none has a just grievance against it\u201d (Cohen 2011, 125) and\njustice and think that state intervention to eliminate differential\noption luck would be ilegitimate even if it would thereby bring about\na less unjust distribution. Again, the claim that differential option\nluck is bad is consistent with the view that, given that people do\nchoose to gamble, it is better, all things considered, if differential\noption luck is not eliminated, even if it would be better,\njustice-wise, if people had chosen not to gamble in the first place\n(Lippert-Rasmussen 2001, 576; compare Cohen 2011, 124\u2013143;\nPersson 2006).\n8. Neutralizing Luck and Equality\n\nMany passages in the luck egalitarian literature suggest that justice\nis luck-neutralization, not luck-amplification, not luck-mitigation\n(Mason 2006), and not luck-equalization. Consider, for instance,\nRawls\u2019 remark that \u201cIntuitively, the most obvious\ninjustice of the system of natural liberty is that it permits\ndistributive shares to be improperly influenced by these factors\n[i.e., social circumstances and such chance contingencies as accident\nand good fortune] so arbitrary from a moral point of view\u201d\n(Rawls 1971, 71). On the admittedly disputable assumption that Rawls\nthinks that factors that are \u201carbitrary from a moral point of\nview\u201d and affect people\u2019s interests are a matter of luck,\none might read this passage as saying that under a just distribution,\nluck does not influence distributive shares (Rawls 1971, 72). As we\nsaw in Section 2 a similar passage can be found in Cohen\u2019s work:\n\u201canyone who thinks that initial advantage and inherent capacity\nare unjust distributors thinks so because he believes that they make a\nperson\u2019s fate depend too much on sheer luck\u201d (Cohen 1989,\n932). This passage can be read as suggesting that the aim of\nneutralizing luck justifies equality and that realizing equality will\neliminate luck.\n\nSuch passages can, however, be read in other ways. Thus Rawls might\nsimply mean to say that, while luck influences distributive shares\nunder a just distribution, it does not do so improperly. Likewise,\nCohen might be saying that, while people\u2019s fates depend on luck\nunder a just distribution, they do not depend on sheer luck. And the\nfact that there is room for these different readings encourages us to\nask exactly what role luck-neutralization can play in relation to a\ntheory of distributive justice.\n\nAddressing this question, Susan Hurley distinguishes between a\nspecificatory and a justificatory role for the aim of\nluck-neutralization. In the first role, the aim specifies what\negalitarianism \u201cis and what it demands\u201d (Hurley 2003,\n147). In the second, it provides a justification for favoring\negalitarian over non-egalitarian theories of distributive justice.\nHurley believes that the luck-neutralizing aim fails in both roles. If\nthe aim were to play either role, it would have to be the case that\nthe favored distribution\u2014e.g., equality, utility maximization,\nor maximizing the position of the worst off\u2014limits the influence\nof luck on outcomes. However, there is no clear sense in which this is\nthe case (compare Parfit, 1995, 12). For the sake of simplicity,\nsuppose the favored distribution is an equal one. Suppose also that\nthe inequality that we are concerned with exists between two people\nwho have each been stranded on a small island. Through sheer good\nluck, the first person\u2019s island is lush and fertile, and through\nsheer bad luck the other person\u2019s island is arid. It does not\nfollow from the fact that this unequal outcome is the result of luck\nthat, if we eliminate the inequality, the resulting equal outcome will\nnot to the same degree be the result of luck, i.e., will not be one in\nwhich factors for which people are not responsible play no (or a\nsmaller) causal role in bringing about the outcome. To see this,\nassume we are dealing with thick, control-based responsibility luck\nand imagine that a powerful egalitarian intervener dumps a shipload of\nfertilizer on the second island so that equality in the Robinson\nCrusoe-like setting is realized. Since neither of the two people\ncontrolled what happened, the resulting equality here is just as much\na matter of luck for them as the prior inequality was. Since we can\nimplement equality without eliminating luck, this shows that we can\nneither justify equality as a means of neutralizing luck, nor specify\nwhat equality requires as neutralizing luck. The same applies to other\nend-result principles (Hurley 2003, 146\u201380).\n\nIn response to this important point, it might be argued that when\nluck-egalitarians write about \u201cneutralizing luck\u201d, this is\nreally short-hand for something like \u201celiminating the\ndifferential effects on people\u2019s interests of factors which from\ntheir perspective are a matter of luck.\u201d This is no different\nfrom saying that affirmative action in favor of women is a way of\nneutralizing the effects of sexist discrimination. In saying this, we\ndo not imagine that affirmative action removes sexist discrimination\nand all its effects; we mean merely that the affirmative action\nprogram eliminates the differential effects on men and women of sexist\ndiscrimination (e.g., in university admissions). On this reading,\nconsiderations about luck serve, not to justify equality, but to\nselect the appropriate egalitarian view from among the large family of\nviews that ascribe intrinsic significance to equality. As Arneson puts\nit: \u201cThe argument for equal opportunity rather than straight\nequality is simply that it is morally fitting to hold individuals\nresponsible for the foreseeable consequences of their voluntary\nchoices\u201d (Arneson 1989, 88). Equality is the default position,\nmorally speaking. It is not justified by appeal to luck. Such an\nappeal, however, explains why some deviations from this default\nposition need not be bad from an egalitarian point of view, for in the\nrelevant deviations it is not a matter of luck that some people are\nworse off than others. In response to Hurley\u2019s point, Cohen\noffers a related reply: \u201cThat it extinguishes the influence of\nluck is no more of an argument for egalitarianism than that it\npromotes utility is an argument for utilitarianism and in each case\nfor the same reason, to wit, that the cited feature is too definitive\nof the position in question to justify the position in question\u201d\n(Cohen 2006, 441\u2013442; see also Vallentyne 2006, 434; Hurley\n2006, 459\u2013465). In fact, he goes on to offer something which is\nmore radical than the short-hand description of the luck-egalitarian\naim offered in the opening sentence of this paragraph. Since\nluck-egalitarians are opposed to luck \u201cin the name of\nfairness\u201d (compare Temkin 2003(a), 767) and since, no less than\ninequality, equality is unfair when \u201cin disaccord with\nchoice\u201d, equality might be unjust for exactly the same reason as\ninequality might (Cohen 2006, 444; cf. Segall 2012). Pragmatic, not\nprincipled, reasons explain why unjust equalities tend to not to be\nmentioned by luck-egalitarians.\n\nFor a further discussion of the notion of bad and good luck, see the\nfollowing supplementary document:\n Bad Luck Versus Good Luck.\n9. Non-Separability of Luck and Effort\n\nA number of luck egalitarian accounts suggest that how much talent\npeople have is a matter of luck, whereas their levels of effort are\nnot. Metaphorically speaking, the first is a matter of the cards one\nhas been dealt, whereas the latter is a matter of how one chooses to\nplay them. To be sure, it will often be plausible to say that\none\u2019s present level of talent reflects past effort, and that\none\u2019s level of effort is a matter of good or bad luck (Rawls\n1971, 74). Partly for the sake of simplicity, and partly because the\nproblem about separability will arise whichever way we make the cut\nbetween luck and non-luck with regard to talents and efforts, let us\ninitially assume that while talents are wholly a matter of luck,\none\u2019s levels of effort are wholly a matter of non-luck.\nAccordingly, people who have different levels of talent, but the same\nlevel of effort should end up equally well off if we neutralize the\neffects of luck, whereas people who have the same levels of talent but\ndifferent levels of effort should end unequally well off. More\ngenerally, differences in effort should be reflected in differences in\nreward, but differences in talent should not. Under these assumptions\nwe can easily identify a luck-neutralizing distribution under the\nassumption of a constant sum of rewards in the following four-person\ncase:\n\nTable 1.\n\n\nActual level of talents\nActual level of efforts\nActual distribution of rewards\nLuck-neutralizing distribution of rewards \n\nAdam\nLow\nLow\n10\n17.5 \n\nBeatrice\nHigh\nHigh\n30\n22.5 \n\nClaude\nLow\nHigh\n20\n22.5 \n\nDorothy\nHigh\nLow\n20\n17.5 \n\n\nThis distribution neutralizes luck (not necessarily uniquely: there\nmay be other luck-neutralizing distributions). Adam and Dorothy, who\ndespite different levels of talent put in the same amount of effort,\nget the same level of reward. The same is true of Beatrice and Claude.\nBeatrice and Claude\u2019s levels of reward are higher than Adam and\nDorothy\u2019s, reflecting their higher level of effort.\n\nAssume next that level of effort is non-separable from level of\ntalent. That is, assume that if a group of people\u2019s levels of\ntalent had been different from what they actually are, so would their\nlevels of effort. Assume that in our four-person case above the facts\nare as follows:\n\nTable 2.\n\n\nActual level of talents\nActual level of efforts\nCounter-\n\nfactual level of talents\nCounter-\n\nfactual level of efforts\nActual distri-\n\nbution of rewards\nLuck-neutral-\n\nizing distri-\n\nbution of rewards \n\nAdam\nLow\nLow\nHigh\nHigh\n10\n? \n\nBeatrice\nHigh\nHigh\nLow\nLow\n30\n? \n\nClaude\nLow\nHigh\nHigh\nHigh\n20\n? \n\nDorothy\nHigh\nLow\nLow\nLow\n20\n? \n\n\nIt no longer is clear which distribution neutralizes luck. Two\nresponses seem possible, both of which may have unattractive\nimplications.\n\nFirst, suppose we insist that counterfactual levels of effort are\nsimply irrelevant to luck-neutralization: ex hypothesi,\none\u2019s actual levels of effort are not a matter of luck, and a\nluck-neutralizing distribution should fit the distribution of actual\nefforts. This view may fail to capture the full range of\nluck-egalitarian intuitions. After all, Adam\u2014if for a moment we\ndisregard problems about knowledge and indeterminacy in counterfactual\nchoices (Hurley 2001, 66\u201369; Hurley 2003,\n164\u2013168)\u2014might correctly say that his case is identical to\nBeatrice\u2019s, and that he was merely unlucky not to be talented.\nAnd given that the cause of their putting in different levels of\neffort is simply a matter of luck, how can Beatrice\u2019s higher\nlevel of effort justify a higher level of reward for her? In not being\ntalented, Adam may have suffered from bad circumstantial luck. That is\nto say, the circumstances in which he decided on his levels of\neffort\u2014his particular skills not being much in demand\u2014may\nhave ensured that those decisions were less prudent than they would\nhave been in different contexts. Alternatively, Adam may have suffered\nfrom bad constitutive luck in that he could have been differently\nconstituted, and had he been so he would have made greater effort.\n\nSecond, we might say that actual as well as counterfactual levels of\neffort matter (compare Zimmerman 1993, 226). Rewards should match\naverage effort across different possible worlds. Since Claude\u2019s\nlevels of effort are high whatever his level of talent,\nDorothy\u2019s are low whatever her level of talent, and Adam\u2019s\nand Beatrice\u2019s levels of effort varies with their level of\ntalent, a luck-neutralizing distribution would leave Claude best off,\nAdam and Beatrice second-best off, and Dorothy worst off. The problem\nnow is that people who actually make the same efforts, i.e., Adam and\nDorothy and Beatrice and Claude, are rewarded differently. Beatrice\nmight complain that her level of effort is as high as Claude\u2019s,\nand yet he gets rewarded more\u2014and he does so, moreover, not\nsolely as a consequence of how he actually conducted himself, but\npartly as a result of how he would have conducted himself had his\nlevel of talent been different from what it in fact is. When we focus\non thick, responsibility control luck or thick, responsibility choice\nluck, it becomes unclear whether this is the right way to neutralize\nluck. For, on many accounts of responsibility, what I am responsible\nfor depends on properties of the actual sequence of events and not on\nwhat I would have done in some counterfactual sequence of events in\nwhich my personality differs from the way it actually is. It appears\nthat, to reconcile such thick accounts of luck with neutralizing luck\non the basis of counterfactual levels of effort, we would need to\nendorse a regressive conception of responsibility on which to be\nresponsible for something one has to be responsible for its causes.\nThis would solve the problem of accounting for which distribution\nneutralizes luck in that, as argued above, it now seems that the only\ndistribution that neutralizes luck is an equal one. However, it would\nalso prevent luck-egalitarians from claiming that people with\ndifferent levels of talent should be rewarded differently. Hence,\nwhile the non-separability of talent and effort does not refute\nluck-egalitarianism, two ways of resolving the issues it raises\ngenerate further problems (see also Elford 2017b; Miller 2014).\n10. Relational Egalitarianism and the Critique of Luck-Egalitarianism\n\nMost egalitarians want to compensate people for bad brute luck but not\nfor bad option luck. Moreover, they have tended to assume that this is\nessentially what justice is about. Recently, this attitude has been\ncriticized as either leaving out of the picture an important\nnon-distributive egalitarian concern, to wit, an egalitarian concern\nfor the nature of social relations, or, more radically, as being a\ncomplete misconstrual of egalitarian justice (Anderson 1999; Anderson\n2010; Anderson 2012; Scanlon 2018; Scheffler 2003; Scheffler 2005;\nSchemmel 2021; for an overview see Fourie et. al. (eds.) 2015).\n\nJonathan Wolff defends the moderate position that while distributive\nconcerns about bad brute luck are part of what justice is about, that\nis not the whole story: \u201cDistributive justice should be limited\nin its application by other egalitarian concerns\u201d (Wolff 1998,\n122; cp. Scheffler 2015), for the ideal of justice also includes the\nview that we should respect one another as equals. According to Wolff,\nthis introduces a reason not to strive for perfect equality of\nopportunity. For making people equally well off in terms of\nopportunity would require \u201cshameful revelations\u201d on the\npart of people who must, for instance, pass on to others (and thus\nthemselves come to terms with) the information that they have no\ntalent (for a discussion, see Albertsen and Nielsen 2020; Elford\n2017a; Hinton 2001; Inoue 2022; Lang 2009, 329\u2013338; Preda and\nVoigt 2022; Wolff 2010).\n\nWolff\u2019s point is well made, but luck-egalitarians may be able to\naccommodate it. First, insofar as they accept Wolff\u2019s factual\nobservation, they may think that this points to a strong (welfarist)\nluck-egalitarian reason not to implement equality of opportunity: we\ncan know in advance that collecting the relevant information is likely\nto make some of those who are already worse off through bad luck even\nworse off. Of course, this would not show that if we could\ncollect the relevant information without bad side effects, we should\nnot aim to compensate bad brute luck alone. Additionally,\nluck-egalitarians may simply concede that the pursuit of the\nluck-egalitarian ideal is constrained by, or otherwise balanced\nagainst the pursuit of, other ideals, including that of equal respect.\nIn any case, luck-egalitarians are unlikely to claim that\nluck-neutralization is the only ideal, as that would imply that a\nworld where everyone lives miserable lives is better, all things\nconsidered, than a world where half the people live tremendous lives\nand the other half live even better lives.\n\nLike Wolff, Elizabeth Anderson argues that egalitarians believe people\nshould live in communities based on principles that \u201cexpress\nequal respect and concern for all citizens\u201d (Anderson 1999, 289;\ncompare Scheffler 2003, 22,31). Unlike Wolff, however, Anderson makes\nthe more radical claim that (true) egalitarians have, in a way, no\nnon-instrumental concern about distribution at all: they are concerned\nabout distribution only indirectly, their direct concern being that\nmembers of the community should stand as equals (compare Scheffler\n2003, 22; Anderson 2010). No doubt, to achieve this, large scale\nredistribution of income, wealth, etc., might be required, but the\nelimination of differential brute luck or for that matter distributive\ninequalities per se is not. What is required is the ability of all to\nfunction as equal human beings in civil society and in political\ndecision making.\n\nLuck-egalitarians, inter alia, question whether this picture is\ncorrect (Barry 2006; Knight 2005; Gheaus 2018; Knight 2009,\n122\u2013166; Navin 2011; Tan 2008; Miklosi 2018; but see Kaufman\n2004). First, they might dispute the very way in which Anderson\ndescribes the disagreement. They might do so because they think social\nstanding can be seen as a good, which, setting aside considerations\nabout responsibility, should be distributed equally from a luck\negalitarian point of view (Lippert-Rasmussen 2015a,b;\nLippert-Rasmussen 2018). If so, luck egalitarianism might be able to\naccommodate many of Anderson\u2019s concerns. Or they might think\nthat (most) luck egalitarians and critics like Anderson simply address\ndifferent questions. The former ask what constitutes a fair\ndistribution, whereas the latter asks what we owe one another\n(Vallentyne 2015). These are different (though possibly related)\nquestions, because, arguably, distributions might be unfair even if no\none has failed to do what they owe others, say, if some die young and\nothers die old, and there is nothing anyone could do to prevent this\nfrom being so (cp. Lippert-Rasmussen 2018; Moles and Parr 2019).\nSecond, suppose resources are distributed in such a way that equal\nfunctioning in civil society and in political decision making is\nassured. Suppose, moreover, that we can choose between two\ndistributions: one that benefits those who are worse off in terms of\nhow well their lives go, and another that benefits those who are best\noff in terms of how well their lives go. Since this choice will not\naffect democratic equality, these options are equally good on\nAnderson\u2019s account. To many, this is an unattractive implication\nof her view. Of course, if the threshold of equal functioning is very\nhigh the problem becomes less serious. However, with high thresholds a\ndifferent problem becomes more serious. For if people should be\nassured of equal functioning at a very high level irrespective of\nwhether they act (perhaps repeatedly) in irresponsibly foolish ways,\nit will not seem fair to impose the cost of their choices on\nothers\u2014i.e., the cost of bringing them up to the appropriate\nthreshold of equal functioning (Arneson 2000, 347\u2013348; for a\nreply, see Anderson (Other Internet Resources, 2(e)). Intuitively,\nthen, the complaint is that democratic equality ascribes no\nsignificance to the fact that responsibility can negate luck. It is\nfar from clear that concern about equal status overturns the pivotal\nbelief that justice is concerned with compensation for bad luck (see,\nhowever, Scheffler 2003; Scheffler 2005; Scheffler 2015). Indeed, the\npresent line of thought suggests that luck-ist versions of the\nrelational ideal might be more plausible than non-luckist versions.\nWhile much of the relational egalitarian critique of luck\negalitarianism has focused on the weight it gives to considerations\nconcerning luck, the issue of how this question is resolved is a\ndifferent issue from the issue of whether justice concerns\ndistributions or relations (or both). This is reflected in the fact\nthat two possible views are outcome egalitarianism and luckist\nversions of relational egalitarianism, according to which to relate as\nequals the way in which we treat one another must reflect differential\nchoice, responsibility etc. On the latter view I might not relate to\nothers as equals if I expect them to bear the costs of my\nirresponsible choices.\n",
