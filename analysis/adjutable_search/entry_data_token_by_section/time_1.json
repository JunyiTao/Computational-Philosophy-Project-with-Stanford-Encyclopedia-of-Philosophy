    "main_text": "Reductionism and Platonism with Respect to Time\n2. Reductionism and Platonism with Respect to Time\n\nWhat if one day things everywhere ground to a halt? What if birds\nfroze in mid-flight, people froze in mid-sentence, and planets and\nsubatomic particles alike froze in mid-orbit? What if all change,\nthroughout the entire universe, completely ceased for a period of,\nsay, one year? Is such a thing possible?\n\nIf the answer to this last question is \u201cyes\u201d\u2014if it\nis possible for there to be time without change\u2014then time is in\nsome important sense independent of the events within time. Other ways\nof investigating whether time is independent of the events within time\ninclude asking whether all of the physical processes that happen in\ntime could happen at a faster or slower rate, and asking whether all\nevents could have happened slightly earlier or later in time. After\nall, if every physical process could suddenly happen twice as fast, or\nif every event could take place slightly earlier or later in time,\nthen it follows that in some important sense time can remain the same\neven if the way that events are distributed in time changes\nwholesale.\n\nAristotle and Leibniz, among others, have argued that time is not\nindependent of the events that occur in time. This view is typically\ncalled either \u201creductionism with respect to time\u201d or\n\u201crelationism with respect to time\u201d, since according to\nthis view, all talk that appears to be about time can somehow be\nreduced to talk about temporal relations among things and events. The\nopposing view, normally referred to either as \u201cPlatonism with\nrespect to time\u201d or \u201csubstantivalism with respect to\ntime\u201d or \u201cabsolutism with respect to time\u201d, has been\ndefended by Plato, Newton, and others. On this view, time is like an\nempty container into which things and events may be placed; but it is\na container that is independent of what (if anything) is placed in\nit.\n\nAnother way to present this distinction is to say that those like\nPlato and Newton who think that time is independent of the events that\noccur in time believe in \u201cabsolute time\u201d. Those like\nAristotle and Leibniz, who think that time is not independent of the\nevents that occur in time, deny the existence of absolute time, though\nthey still endorse \u201crelative time\u201d, where relative time is\nnothing over and above the temporal relations between events.\n\nThese views about time are closely connected to views about space and\nabout motion. Most obviously, these views about time have\nstraightforward spatial analogues\u2014one may be a substantivalist\nabout space (and thus endorse the existence of absolute space in\naddition to spatial relations between things), or one may be a\nrelationist about space (and thus deny the existence of absolute\nspace). Substantivalism and relationism about time have traditionally\nbeen taken to stand or fall with their spatial counterparts. In\naddition, the choice between substantivalism and relationism about\nspace and time has consequences for your theory of motion. If you are\na relationist about space and time then you must also be a relationist\nabout motion: all motion is motion relative to something. If you are a\nsubstantivalist about space and time, you will endorse, in addition to\nrelative motion, the notion of absolute motion, where absolute motion\nis motion relative to absolute space and time. If you are a\nsubstantivalist, in addition to facts about whether and how fast a\ntrain car is moving relative to the track, whether and how fast it is\nmoving relative to the cars, and so on, there will also be a fact\nabout whether and how fast the train car is really\nmoving\u2014whether and how fast it is moving relative to absolute\nspace and time.\n\nWhy would someone endorse the existence of absolute time? One reason\nis that the empty container metaphor has a lot of intuitive appeal.\nAnother reason is that some philosophers have thought that there must\nbe such a thing as absolute motion\u2014as opposed to merely relative\nmotion\u2014in order to explain certain physical phenomena, like the\nforces felt during acceleration. Newton had an especially famous\nargument along these lines involving a spinning bucket of\nwater\u2014the entry on\n Newton\u2019s views on space, time,\n and motion has a careful discussion of this argument.\n\nWhy would someone deny the existence of absolute time? Some\nrelationists have put forward arguments that are supposed to show that\nabsolute space and time are philosophically problematic in some\nimportant way. Perhaps most famously, Leibniz argued that the\nexistence of absolute space or time would lead to violations of the\nprinciple of sufficient reason and violations of the identity of\nindiscernibles.\n\nIn order to see why, consider two ways of describing the way things\ncould be. On the one hand, everything is as it actually is. On the\nother, every event happens one second later than it actually does, but\nis otherwise exactly the same. If there is such a thing as absolute\ntime then these two descriptions would pick out distinct possible\nworlds. But this, Leibniz claimed, would violate the principle of\nsufficient reason. For given that the actual world and the\none-second-late world are exactly the same except for where things are\nlocated in absolute time, there could not (at least according to\nLeibniz) be any reason why one exists rather than the other. Moreover,\nLeibniz claimed, the actual world and the one-second-late world are\nindistinguishable; so if they were in fact distinct possible worlds,\nthat would violate the principle that if two things are\nindistinguishable, then they are identical.\n\nLeibniz\u2019s arguments are examples of arguments that attempt to\nidentify something philosophically problematic with absolute time and\nspace. Perhaps more generally, many philosophers have been moved by\nthe idea that even if absolute time and space are not problematic in a\nway that makes them unacceptable, they are still the kinds of things\nthat we should do without if we can. This kind of attitude can be\nmotivated by a straightforward kind of parsimony\u2014we should\nalways make do with the fewest types of entities possible. Or it can\nbe motivated by a more specific worry about the nature of absolute\nspace and time. You might, for instance, be especially loath\u00a0to\nadmit unobservable entities into your ontology\u2014you are willing\nto admit them if you must, but you would rather eliminate them\nwherever possible. As absolute space and time are unobservable,\nsomeone who endorses this attitude will be inclined to think there are\nno such things.\n\nSuggestions for Further Reading: Alexander 1956;\nAriew 2000; Arntzenius 2012; Coope 2001; Mitchell 1993; Newton,\nPhilosophical Writings; Newton-Smith 1980; Shoemaker\n1969.\n",
