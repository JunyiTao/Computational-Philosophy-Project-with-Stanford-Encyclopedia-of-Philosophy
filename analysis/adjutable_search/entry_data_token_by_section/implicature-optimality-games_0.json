    "main_text": "Bidirectional Optimality Theory || Bidirectional OT and Quantity implicatures\n1.1 Bidirectional OT and Quantity implicatures\n\nOptimality Theory (OT) is a linguistic theory which assumes that\nlinguistic choices are governed by competition between a set of\ncandidates, or alternatives. In standard OT (Prince & Smolensky,\n1993) the optimal candidate is the one that satisfies best a set of\nviolable constraints. After its success in phonology, OT has also been\nused in syntax, semantics and pragmatics. The original idea of\noptimality-theoretic semantics was to model interpretation by taking\nthe candidates to be the alternative interpretations that the hearer\ncould assign to a given expression, with constraints describing\ngeneral preferences over expression-interpretation pairs. Blutner\n(1998, 2000) extended this original version by taking also alternative\nexpressions, or forms, into account that the speaker could have used,\nbut did not. The reference to alternative expressions/forms is\nstandard in pragmatics to account for Quantity implicatures.\nOptimization should thus be thought of from two directions: that of\nthe hearer, and that of the speaker. What is optimal, according to\nBlutner\u2019s Bidirectional-OT (Bi-OT), is not just interpretations\nwith respect to forms, but rather form-interpretation pairs. In terms\nof a \u2018better than\u2019 relation \u2018\\(\\gt\\)\u2019 between\nform-interpretation pairs, the pair \\(\\langle f,i\\rangle\\) is said to\nbe (strongly) optimal iff it satisfies the following\ntwo conditions: \n\n\\[\\begin{align} \\neg \\exists i' &: \\langle f,i'\\rangle \\gt \\langle f,i\\rangle \\\\ \\neg \\exists f' &: \\langle f', i\\rangle \\gt \\langle f,i\\rangle \\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThe first condition requires that \\(i\\) is an optimal interpretation\nof form \\(f\\). In Bi-OT this condition is thought of as optimization\nfrom the hearer\u2019s point of view. Blutner proposed that \\(\\langle\nf,i'\\rangle \\gt \\langle f,i\\rangle\\) iff \\(i'\\) is a more likely, or\nstereotypical, interpretation of \\(f\\) than \\(i\\) is: \\(P(i'\\mid\n\\llbracket f\\rrbracket) \\gt P(i\\mid \\llbracket f \\rrbracket)\\) (where\n\\(\\llbracket f\\rrbracket\\) denotes the semantic meaning of \\(f\\), and\n\\(P(B\\mid A)\\) the conditional probability of \\(B\\) given \\(A\\),\ndefined as \\(P(A\\cap B)/P(A))\\). The second condition is taken to\ninvolve speaker\u2019s optimization: for \\(\\langle f,i\\rangle\\) to be\noptimal for the speaker, it has to be the case that she cannot use a\nmore optimal form \\(f'\\) to express \\(i. \\langle f',i\\rangle \\gt\n\\langle f,i\\rangle\\) iff either (i) \\(P(i\\mid \\llbracket f'\\rrbracket)\n\\gt P(i\\mid \\llbracket f\\rrbracket)\\), or (ii) \\(P(i\\mid\\llbracket\nf'\\rrbracket = P(i\\mid\\llbracket f\\rrbracket)\\) and \\(f'\\) is a less\ncomplex form to express \\(i\\) than \\(f\\) is.\n\nBi-OT accounts for classical Quantity implicatures. A convenient\n(though controversial) example is the\n\u2018exactly\u2019-interpretation of number terms. Let us assume,\nfor the sake of example, that number terms semantically have an\n\u2018at\n least\u2019-meaning.[1]\n Still, we want to account for the intuition that the sentence\n\u201cThree children came to the party\u201d is normally interpreted\nas saying that exactly three children came to the party. One\nway to do this is to assume that the alternative expressions that the\nspeaker could use are of the form \u201c(At least) \\(n\\)\nchildren came to the party\u201d, while the alternative\ninterpretations for the hearer are of type \\(i_n\\) meaning that\n\u201cExactly \\(n\\) children came to the\n party\u201d.[2]\n If we assume, again for the sake of example, that all relevant\ninterpretations are considered equally likely and that it is already\ncommonly assumed that some children came, but not more than four, the\nstrongly optimal form-interpretation pairs can be read off the\nfollowing table:\n\n\n\\(P(i\\mid \\llbracket f\\rrbracket)\\)\n\\(i_1\\)\n\\(i_2\\)\n\\(i_3\\)\n\\(i_4\\) \n\n\u2018one\u2019\n\\(\\Rightarrow\\)\u00bc\n\u00bc\n\u00bc\n\u00bc \n\n\u2018two\u2019\n0\n\\(\\Rightarrow \u2153\\)\n\\(\u2153\\)\n\\(\u2153\\) \n\n\u2018three\u2019\n0\n0\n\\(\\Rightarrow\\) \u00bd\n\u00bd \n\n\u2018four\u2019\n0\n0\n0\n\\(\\Rightarrow 1\\) \n\n\nIn this table the entry \\(P(i_3 \\mid\n\\llbracket\\)\u2018two\u2019\\(\\rrbracket) = \u2153\\) because\n\\(P(i_3 \\mid \\{i_2,i_3,i_4\\}) = \u2153\\). Notice that according to\nthis reasoning \u2018two\u2019 is interpreted as \u2018exactly\n2\u2019 (as indicated by an arrow) because (i) \\(P(i_2 \\mid\n\\llbracket\\)\u2018two\u2019\\(\\rrbracket) = \u2153\\) is higher than\n\\(P(i_2 \\mid \\llbracket\\)\u2018\\(n \\textrm{'} \\rrbracket)\\) for any\nalternative expression \u2018\\(n\\)\u2019, and (ii) all other\ninterpretations compatible with the semantic meaning of the numeral\nexpression are blocked: there is, for instance, another\nexpression for which \\(i_4\\) is a better interpretation, i.e., an\ninterpretation with a higher conditional probability.\n\nWith numeral terms, the semantic meanings of the alternative\nexpressions give rise to a linear order. This turns out to be crucial\nfor the Bi-OT analysis, if we continue to take the interpretations as\nspecific as we have done so far. Consider the following alternative\nanswers to the question \u201cWho came to the party?\u201d:\n\nJohn came to the party.\nJohn or Bill came to the party.\n\n\nSuppose that John and Bill are the only relevant persons and that it\nis presupposed that somebody came to the party. In that case the table\nthat illustrates bidirectional optimality reasoning looks as follows\n(where \\(i_x\\) is the interpretation that only \\(x\\) came):\n\n\n\\(P(i\\mid \\llbracket f\\rrbracket)\\)\n\\(i_j\\)\n\\(i_b\\)\n\\(i_{jb}\\) \n\n\u2018John\u2019\n\\(\\Rightarrow \u00bd\\)\n0\n\\(\u00bd\\) \n\n\u2018Bill\u2019\n0\n\\(\\Rightarrow \u00bd\\)\n\\(\u00bd\\) \n\n\u2018John and Bill\u2019\n0\n0\n\\(\\Rightarrow 1\\) \n\n\u2018John or Bill\u2019\n\\(\u2153\\)\n\\(\u2153\\)\n\\(\u2153\\) \n\n\nThis table correctly predicts that (1) is interpreted as saying that\nonly John came. But now consider the disjunction (2).\nIntuitively, this answer should be interpreted as saying that either\nonly John, or only Bill came. It is easy to see, however, that this is\npredicted only if \u2018John came\u2019 and \u2018Bill came\u2019\nare not taken to be alternative forms. Bi-OT predicts that in case\nalso \u2018John came\u2019 and \u2018Bill came\u2019 are taken to\nbe alternatives, the disjunction is uninterpretable, because the\nspecific interpretations \\(i_j, i_b\\), and \\(i_{jb}\\) all can be\nexpressed better by other forms. In general, one can see that in case\nthe semantic meanings of the alternative expressions are not linearly,\nbut only partially ordered, the derivation of Quantity implicatures\nsketched above gives rise to partially wrong predictions.\n\nAs it turns out, this problem for Bi-OT seems larger than it really\nis. Intuitively, an answer like (2) suggests that the speaker has\nincomplete information (she doesn\u2019t know who of John or Bill\ncame). But the interpretations that we considered so far are world\nstates that do not encode different amounts of speaker knowledge. So,\nto take this into account in Bi-OT (or in any other analysis of\nQuantity implicatures) we should allow for alternative interpretations\nthat represent different knowledge states of the speaker. Aloni (2007)\ngives a Bi-OT account of ignorance implicatures (inferences, like the\nabove, that the speaker lacks certain bits of possibly relevant\ninformation), alongside indifference implicatures (that the\nspeaker does not consider bits of information relevant enough to\nconvey). Moreover, it can be shown that, as far as ignorance\nimplicatures are concerned, the predictions of Bi-OT line up with the\npragmatic interpretation function called \u2018Grice\u2019\nin various (joint) papers of Schulz and Van Rooij (e.g., Schulz &\nVan Rooij, 2006). In these papers it is claimed that Grice\nimplements the Gricean maxim of Quality and the first maxim of\nQuantity, and it is shown that in terms of it (together with an\nadditional assumption of competence) we can account for many\nconversational implicatures, including the ones of (1) and (2).\n",
