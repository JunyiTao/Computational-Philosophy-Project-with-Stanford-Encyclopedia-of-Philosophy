    "main_text": "Principles and Theories || The Independence Constraint\n2.2 The Independence Constraint\n\nA large part of the appeal of wide reflective equilibrium is its\nappeal to deeper background theories. For example, my principles of\njustice may depend in part on my views of individual agency; and my\nviews on agency may in turn depend on my views about free will and\ncausation. But isn\u2019t there a danger that this broad coherence is\nbought at the cost of circularity?\n\nSuppose, for instance, that I have the conviction that no one should\nbe very badly off. This judgment might support a sufficientarian\nprinciple of justice requiring that no one is very badly off (e.g.,\nFrankfurt 1987). But suppose I now claim that this principle is also\nsupported by the combination of the luck egalitarian background theory\nthat no one should be badly off through no genuine choice of their own\n(Cohen 1989) with the hard determinist background theory that no one\nis responsible for their choices, and my basis for the latter theory\nis the original judgment no one should be very badly off. In such a\ncase it seems that the background theories give no independent support\nfor the sufficientarian principle, i.e., no support that was not\nalready there in the bare judgment that no one should be very badly\noff. If it were not for that judgment, I would not have a basis for my\nhard determinist background theory, and the luck egalitarian\nbackground theory alone would not support the sufficientarian\nprinciple, as it is consistent with some being very badly off due to\nchoice.\n\nIn response to such cases we can utilize an independence\nconstraint (Daniels 1996: 22\u201324). Suppose we\ndistinguish principle judgments, which support the\nprinciples, from background judgments, which support the\nbackground theories. The independence constraint requires that\nprinciple judgments are not also background judgments. Background\ntheories must draw on their own judgments and cannot\n\u201crecycle\u201d principle judgments. As Daniels puts it,\n\n\n[t]he background theories in (c) should show that the moral principles\nin (b) are more acceptable than alternative principles on grounds to\nsome degree independent of (b)\u2019s match with relevant considered\nmoral judgments in (a). If they are not in this way independently\nsupported, then there seems to be no gain over the support the\nprinciples would have had in a corresponding narrow equilibrium, where\nthere never was any appeal to (c). (Daniels 1996: 22)\n\n\nHe applies this to Rawls\u2019 theory of justice, arguing that\nRawls\u2019 theories of the person and the role of morality are not\njust redescriptions of the judgments that support Rawls\u2019 two\nprinciples of justice and thereby satisfy the constraint (Daniels\n1996: 23\u201324, 50\u201362).\n\nSome commentators consider the independence constraint objectionable,\nfor instance suggesting that it encourages holding back some principle\njudgments so they can be used as background judgments to create a wide\nreflective equilibrium (Haslett 1987: 307\u2013308). Yet the\nindependence constraint doesn\u2019t allow judgments to be held back\nin this way\u2014if they support the principles they are necessarily\nprinciple judgments and cannot be used as background judgments (Knight\n2006: 211).\n\nOthers argue that the constraint is superfluous, as\n\n\n[a] person who explicitly cooked up all her relevant background\nbeliefs on the basis of her considered moral judgments would not be\nfollowing the method of reflective equilibrium in the first place.\n(DePaul 1993: 15)\n\n\nBut perhaps the more serious problem the constraint addresses is not\ndeliberate circularity. We want to ensure that our moral principles\nare not merely \u201caccidental generalizations\u201d of\n\u201cmoral facts,\u201d and we can do this by independently testing\nthem against background theories, just as scientific generalizations\nthat inadvertently correspond to observations can be distinguished\nfrom scientific laws by their lack of coherence with connected theory\n(Daniels 1996: 22). Critics suggest accidental generalizations might\nalternatively be weeded out simply by considering a sufficiently large\nnumber of cases (DePaul 1993: 15). A combination of the two approaches\nmay be preferable (Holmgren 1989: 59).\n",
