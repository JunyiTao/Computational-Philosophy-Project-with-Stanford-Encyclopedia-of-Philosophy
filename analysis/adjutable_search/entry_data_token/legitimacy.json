This entry will survey the main answers\nthat have been given to the following questions. First, how should\nlegitimacy be defined? Is it primarily a descriptive or a normative\nconcept? If legitimacy is understood normatively, what does it entail?\nSome associate legitimacy with the justification of coercive power and\nwith the creation of political authority. Others associate it with the\njustification, or at least the sanctioning, of existing political\nauthority. Authority stands for a right to rule\u2014a right to issue\ncommands and, possibly, to enforce these commands using coercive\npower. An additional question is whether legitimate political\nauthority is understood to entail political obligations or not. Most\npeople probably think it does. But some think that the moral\nobligation to obey political authority can be separated from an\naccount of legitimate authority, or at least that such obligations\narise only if further conditions hold.\n\nNext there are questions about the requirements of legitimacy. When\nare political institutions and the decisions made within them\nappropriately called legitimate? Some have argued that this question\nmust be answered primarily on the basis of procedural features of\npolitical decision-making. Others argue that legitimacy\ndepends\u2014exclusively or at least in part\u2014on the substantive\nvalues that are realized. And on what grounds is the procedure versus\nsubstance question to be settled, is it on moral grounds\u2014\nrelating to values such as freedom or equality\u2014or is it on\nepistemic grounds\u2014relating to the epistemic merits of how\npolitical decisions are made? A related question is: does political\nlegitimacy demand democracy or not? Insofar as democracy is seen as\nnecessary for political legitimacy, when are democratic decisions\nlegitimate? Can that question be answered with reference to procedural\nfeatures only, or does democratic legitimacy depend both on procedural\nvalues and on the quality of the decisions made? And what is the role\nof epistemic considerations in this regard? Finally, there is the\nquestion which political institutions are subject to the legitimacy\nrequirement. Historically, legitimacy was associated with the state\nand institutions and decisions within the state. The contemporary\nliterature tends to judge this as too narrow, however. This raises the\nquestion how the concept of legitimacy may apply\u2014beyond the\nnation state and decisions made within it\u2014to the international\nand global context.\n", "toc": [{"#DescNormConcPoliLegi": "1.

Descriptive and Normative Concepts of Political Legitimacy\n\nIf legitimacy is interpreted descriptively, it refers to\npeople\u2019s beliefs about political authority and, sometimes,\npolitical obligations. In his sociology, Max Weber put forward a very\ninfluential account of legitimacy that excludes any recourse to\nnormative criteria (Mommsen 1989: 20, but see Greene 2017 for an\nalternative reading). According to Weber, that a political regime is\nlegitimate means that its participants have certain beliefs or faith\n(\u201cLegitimit\u00e4tsglaube\u201d) in regard to it: \u201cthe\nbasis of every system of authority, and correspondingly of every kind\nof willingness to obey, is a belief, a belief by virtue of which\npersons exercising authority are lent prestige\u201d (Weber 1964:\n382). As is well known, Weber distinguishes among three main sources\nof legitimacy\u2014understood as the acceptance both of authority and\nof the need to obey its commands. People may have faith in a\nparticular political or social order because it has been there for a\nlong time (tradition), because they have faith in the rulers\n(charisma), or because they trust its legality\u2014specifically the\nrationality of the rule of law (Weber 2009 [1918]; 1964). Weber\nidentifies legitimacy as an important explanatory category for social\nscience, because faith in a particular social order produces social\nregularities that are more stable than those that result from the\npursuit of self-interest or from habitual rule-following (Weber 1964:\n124).\n\nIn contrast to Weber\u2019s descriptive concept, the normative\nconcept of political legitimacy refers to some benchmark of\nacceptability or justification of political power or authority\nand\u2014possibly\u2014obligation. On one view, held by John Rawls\n(1993) and Arthur Ripstein (2004), for example, legitimacy refers, in\nthe first instance, to the justification of coercive political power.\nWhether a political body such as a state is legitimate and whether\ncitizens have political obligations towards it depends on whether the\ncoercive political power that the state exercises is justified. On a\nwidely held alternative view, legitimacy is linked to the\njustification of political authority. On this view, political bodies\nsuch as states may be effective, or de facto, authorities,\nwithout being legitimate. They claim the right to rule and to create\nobligations to be obeyed, and as long as these claims are met with\nsufficient acquiescence, they are authoritative. Legitimate authority,\non this view, differs from merely effective or de facto\nauthority in that it actually holds the right to rule and creates\npolitical obligations (e.g., Raz 1986). On some views, even legitimate\nauthority is not sufficient to create political obligations. The\nthought is that a political authority (such as a state) may be\npermitted to issue commands that citizens are not obligated to obey\n(Dworkin 1986: 191). Based on a view of this sort, some have argued\nthat legitimate political authority only gives rise to political\nobligations if additional normative conditions are satisfied (e.g.\nWellman 1996; Edmundson 1998; Buchanan 2002).\n\nThere is sometimes a tendency in the literature to equate the\nnormative concept of legitimacy with justice. Some explicitly define\nlegitimacy as a criterion of minimal justice (e.g., Hampton 1998;\nBuchanan 2002). Someone might claim, for example, that while political\ninstitutions such as states are often unjust, only a just state is\nmorally acceptable and legitimate in this sense. Unfortunately, there\nis sometimes also a tendency to blur the distinction between the two\nconcepts, and a lot of confusion arises from that. Rawls (1993, 1995)\nclearly distinguishes between the two concepts. In his view, while\njustice and legitimacy are related\u2014they draw on the same set of\npolitical values\u2014they have different domains and legitimacy\nmakes weaker demands than justice (1993: 225; 1995: 175ff.). Political\ninstitutions may be legitimate but unjust, but the converse is not\npossible: just political institutions are necessarily legitimate (see\nalso Langvatn 2016 on this). On other views, legitimacy and justice\nhave different normative foundations (e.g., Simmons 2001; Pettit 2012).\nAccording to Pettit (2012: 130ff), a state is just if it imposes a\nsocial order that promotes freedom as non-domination for all its\ncitizens. It is legitimate if it imposes a social order in an\nappropriate way. A state that fails to impose a social order in an\nappropriate way, however just the social order may be, is\nillegitimate. Vice versa, a legitimate state may fail to impose a just\nsocial order.\n\nRealist political theorists criticize any tendency to blur the\ndistinction between legitimacy and justice (e.g., Rossi and Sleat\n2014). They diagnose it as a sign of misplaced \u201cpolitical\nmoralism\u201d (Williams 2005; Horton 2010), or, relatedly, as a\nmisleading interpretation of political theory as a branch of applied\nethics (e.g., Honig 1993). But they also want to carve out an\nalternative to a purely descriptive interpretation of legitimacy.\nBernard Williams\u2019s claim (2005: 4ff) that political institutions\nare subject to a \u201cbasic legitimation demand\u201d has been very\ninfluential in this regard. According to Williams, the first political\nquestion is how a state provides basic political goods such as\nsecurity and stability and the conditions for cooperation. That it\nprovides these goods is a necessary requirement for legitimacy, but it\nis not sufficient. A state is also under the normative expectation to\njustify how it provides these goods. That normative expectation is the\ndistinctively political basic legitimation demand.\n\nBy interpreting the concept of political legitimacy along those lines,\npolitical realists lend support to those who have questioned a sharp\ndistinction between the descriptive and normative concepts of\nlegitimacy (e.g., Habermas 1979; Beetham 1991; Horton 2012). The\nobjection to a strictly normative concept of legitimacy is that it is\nof only limited use in understanding actual processes of legitimation.\nThe charge is that philosophers tend to focus too much on the general\nconditions necessary for the justification of political institutions\nbut neglect the historical actualization of the justificatory process.\nIn J\u00fcrgen Habermas\u2019 words (Habermas 1979: 205):\n\u201cEvery general theory of justification remains peculiarly\nabstract in relation to the historical forms of legitimate domination.\n\u2026 Is there an alternative to this historical injustice of\ngeneral theories, on the one hand, and the standardlessness of mere\nhistorical understanding, on the other?\u201d The objection to a\npurely descriptive concept such as Weber\u2019s is that it neglects\npeople\u2019s second order beliefs about legitimacy\u2014their\nbeliefs, not just about the actual legitimacy of a particular\npolitical institution, but about the justifiability of this\ninstitution, i.e. about what is necessary for legitimacy. According to\nBeetham, a \u201cpower relationship is not legitimate because people\nbelieve in its legitimacy, but because it can be justified in\nterms of their beliefs\u201d (Beetham 1991: 11). As Tommie\nShelby (2007) has highlighted, from the point of view of oppressed\nminorities political institutions often lack legitimacy because they\n(rightly) perceive the social order to be unjust.\n\nA key claim of political realism is that while legitimacy is a\nnormative property of political institutions or decisions, its\nnormativity is not (just) moral (e.g., Rossi 2012, Sleat 2014). In\nsupport of this claim, some realists argue that the basic legitimation\ndemand can\u2019t be satisfied just by appeal to moral arguments, for\nexample because political processes are necessary to forge political\nagreements (Stears 2007). Others focus on the role of epistemic\nnormativity (see the discussion in Burelli and Destri 2022). But, as\nLeader Maynard and Worsnip (2018) ask, is there a distinct political\nnormativity that political realists could resort to? Or does normative\npolitical philosophy have resources to address the realists\u2019\nworries? A possible reply to these questions is that realist political\ntheory is less concerned with the nature of normativity than with\ndrawing attention to neglected topics in political theory (Baderin\n2014; Jubb 2019). But this raises the further question whether there\nis a unified project at the core of political realism, or whether it\nis better seen as the intersection of different projects motivated by\na range of meta-normative, normative, and political concerns.\n2. The Function of Political Legitimacy\n\nThis section lays out the different ways in which legitimacy,\nunderstood normatively, can be seen as relating to political\nauthority, coercion, and political obligations.\n2.1 Legitimacy and the Justification of Political Authority\n\nThe normative concept of political legitimacy is often seen as related\nto the justification of authority. The main function of political\nlegitimacy, on this interpretation, is to explain the difference\nbetween merely effective or de facto authority and legitimate\nauthority.\n\nJohn Locke put forward such an interpretation of legitimacy.\nLocke\u2019s starting-point is a state of nature in which all\nindividuals are equally free to act within the constraints of natural\nlaw and no individual is subject to the will of another. As Rawls\n(2007: 129) characterizes Locke\u2019s understanding of the state of\nnature, it is \u201ca state of equal right, all being kings.\u201d\nNatural law, while manifest in the state of nature, is not\nsufficiently specific to rule a society and cannot enforce itself when\nviolated, however. The solution to this problem is a social contract\nthat transfers political authority to a civil state that can realize\nand secure the natural law. According to Locke, and contrary to his\npredecessor Thomas Hobbes, the social contract thus does not create\nauthority. Political authority is embodied in individuals and\npre-exists in the state of nature. The social contract transfers the\nauthority they each enjoy in the state of nature to a particular\npolitical body.\n\nWhile political authority thus pre-exists in the state of nature,\nlegitimacy is a concept that is specific to the civil state. Because\nthe criterion of legitimacy that Locke proposes is historical,\nhowever, what counts as legitimate authority remains connected to the\nstate of nature. The legitimacy of political authority in the civil\nstate depends, according to Locke, on whether the transfer of\nauthority has happened in the right way. Whether the transfer has\nhappened in the right way depends on individuals\u2019 consent:\n\u201cno one can be put out of this estate and subjected to the\npolitical power of another without his own consent\u201d (Locke 1980\n[1690]: 52). Anyone who has given their express or tacit consent to\nthe social contract is bound to obey a state\u2019s laws (Locke 1980\n[1690]: 63). Locke understands the consent criterion to apply not just\nto the original institutionalization of a political\nauthority\u2014what Rawls (2007: 124) calls \u201coriginating\nconsent\u201d. It also applies to the ongoing evaluation of the\nperformance of a political regime\u2014Rawls (2007: 124) calls this\n\u201cjoining consent\u201d.\n\nAlthough Locke emphasises consent, consent is not, however, sufficient\nfor legitimate authority because an authority that suspends the\nnatural law is necessarily illegitimate (e.g., Simmons 1976). On some\ninterpretations of Locke (e.g., Pitkin 1965), consent is not even\nnecessary for legitimate political authority; the absence of consent\nis only a marker of illegitimacy. Whether an actual political regime\nrespects the constraints of the natural law is thus at least one\nfactor that determines its legitimacy.\n\nThis criterion of legitimacy is negative: it offers an account of when\neffective authority ceases to be legitimate. When a political\nauthority fails to secure consent or oversteps the boundaries of the\nnatural law, it ceases to be legitimate and, therefore, there is no\nlonger an obligation to obey its commands. For Locke\u2014unlike for\nHobbes\u2014political authority can thus not be absolute.\n\nThe contemporary literature has developed Locke\u2019s ideas in\nseveral ways. John Simmons (2001) uses them to argue that we should\ndistinguish between the moral justification of states in general and\nthe political legitimacy of actual states. We will come back to this\npoint in section 3.2. Joseph Raz links legitimacy to the justification\nof political authority. According to Raz, political authority is just\na special case of the more general concept of authority (1986, 1995,\n2006). He defines authority in relation to a claim\u2014of a person\nor an agency\u2014to generate what he calls pre-emptive reasons. Such\nreasons replace other reasons for action that people might have. For\nexample, if a teacher asks her students to do some homework, she\nexpects her say-so to give the students reason to do the homework.\n\nAuthority is effective if it gets people to act on the reasons it\ngenerates. The difference between effective and legitimate authority,\non Raz\u2019 view, is that the former merely purports to change the\nreasons that apply to others, while legitimate authority actually has\nthe capacity to change these reasons. Legitimate authority satisfies a\npre-emption thesis: \u201cThe fact that an authority requires\nperformance of an action is a reason for its performance which is not\nto be added to all other relevant reasons when assessing what to do,\nbut should exclude and take the place of some of them\u201d (Raz\n1986: 46). (There are limits to what even a legitimate authority can\nrightfully order others to do, which is why it does not necessarily\nreplace all relevant reasons.)\n\nWhen is effective or de facto authority legitimate? In other\nwords, what determines whether the pre-emption thesis is satisfied?\nRaz\u2019 answer is captured in two further theses. The\n\u201cdependence thesis\u201d states that the justification of\npolitical authority depends on the normative reasons that apply to\nthose under its rule directly, independently of the authority\u2019s\ndirectives. Building on the dependence thesis, the \u201cnormal\njustification thesis\u201d then states that political authority is\njustified if it enables those subject to it to better comply with the\nreasons that apply to them anyway. In full, the normal justification\nthesis says: \u201cThe normal way to establish that a person has\nauthority over another involves showing that the alleged subject is\nlikely to better comply with the reasons which apply to him (other\nthan the alleged authoritative directive) if he accepts the directives\nof the alleged authority as authoritatively binding and tries to\nfollow them, rather than by trying to follow the reasons which apply\nto him directly\u201d (Raz 1986: 53). The normal justification thesis\nexplains why those governed by a legitimate authority ought to treat\nits directives as binding. It thus follows as a corollary of the\nnormal justification thesis that such an authority generates a duty to\nbe obeyed. Raz calls his conception the \u201cservice\nconception\u201d of authority (1986: 56). Note that even though\nlegitimate authority is defined as a special case of effective\nauthority, only the former is appropriately described as a serving its\nsubjects. Illegitimate\u2014but effective\u2014authority does not\nserve those it aims to govern, although it may purport to do so.\n\nWilliam Edmundson formulates this way of linking authority and\nlegitimacy via a condition he calls the warranty thesis: \u201cIf\nbeing an X entails claiming to F, then being a\nlegitimate X entails truly claiming to\nF.\u201d (Edmundson 1998: 39). Being an X here\nstands for \u201ca state\u201d, or \u201can authority\u201d. And\n\u201cto F\u201d stands for \u201cto create a duty to be\nobeyed\u201d, for example. The idea expressed by the warranty thesis\nis that legitimacy morally justifies an independently existing\nauthority such that the claims of the authority become moral\nobligations.\n2.2 Justifying Power and Coercion\n\nThose who link political legitimacy to the problem of justifying\nauthority tend to think of political coercion as only a means that\nlegitimate states may use to secure their authority. As Leslie Green\nputs it: \u201cCoercion threats provide secondary, reinforcing\nmotivation when the political order fails in its primary normative\ntechnique of authoritative guidance\u201d (Green 1988: 75). According\nto a second important view, held by Rawls (1993), for example, the\nmain function of legitimacy is precisely to justify coercive power.\n(For an excellent discussion of the two interpretations of legitimacy\nand a defense of the coercion-based interpretation, see Ripstein 2004;\nsee also Hampton 1998.) On coercion-based interpretations, the main\nproblem that a conception of legitimacy aims to solve is how to\ndistinguish the rightful use of political power from mere coercion.\nWhether a political body such as a state is legitimate and whether\ncitizens have political obligations towards it depends, on this view\non whether the coercive political power that the state exercises is\njustified. Again, there are different ways in which this idea might be\nunderstood.\n\nIn Thomas Hobbes\u2019 influential account, political authority is\ncreated by the social contract. In the state of nature,\neveryone\u2019s self-preservation is under threat, and this makes it\nrational for all to consent to a covenant that authorizes a sovereign\nwho can guarantee their protection and to transfer their rights to\nthis sovereign\u2014an individual or a group of individuals. When\nthere is no such sovereign, one may be created by a\ncovenant\u2014Hobbes calls this \u201csovereignty by\ninstitution\u201d. But political authority may also be established by\nthe promise of all to obey a threatening power (\u201csovereignty by\nacquisition\u201d; see Leviathan, chapter 17). Both manners\nof creating a sovereign are equally legitimate. And political\nauthority will be legitimate as long as the sovereign ensures the\nprotection of the citizens, as Hobbes believes that the natural right\nto self-preservation cannot be relinquished (Leviathan,\nchapter 21). Beyond that, however, there can be no further questions\nabout the legitimacy of the sovereign. In particular, there is no\ndistinction between effective authority and legitimate authority in\nHobbes\u2019 thought. It might even be argued that Hobbes fails to\ndistinguish between legitimate authority and the mere exercise of\npower (Korsgaard 1997: 29; see chapter 30 of Leviathan,\nhowever, for an account of the quality of the sovereign\u2019s\nrule).\n\nAnother way in which the relation between legitimacy and the creation\nof authority may be understood is that the attempt to rule without\nlegitimacy is an attempt to exercise coercive power\u2014not\nauthority. Such a view can be found in Jean-Jacques Rousseau\u2019s\nwork. Legitimacy, for Rousseau, justifies the state\u2019s exercise\nof coercive power and creates an obligation to obey. Rousseau\ncontrasts a legitimate social order with a system of rules that is\nmerely the expression of power. Coercive power is primarily a feature\nof the civil state. While there are some forms of coercive power even\nin the state of nature\u2014for example the power of parents over\ntheir children\u2014Rousseau assumes that harmful coercive power\narises primarily in the civil state and that this creates the problem\nof legitimacy. In the first chapter of the first book of On\nthe Social Contract he remarks that while \u201c[m]an\nis born free\u201d, the civil state he observes makes everyone a\nslave. Rousseau\u2019s main question is under what conditions a civil\nstate, which uses coercive power to back up its laws, can be thought\nof as freeing citizens from this serfdom. Such a state would be\nlegitimate. As he puts it in the opening sentence of the Social\nContract, \u201cI want to inquire whether there can be some\nlegitimate and sure rule of administration in the civil order, taking\nmen as they are and laws as they might be.\u201d\n\nRousseau\u2019s account of legitimacy is importantly different from\nLocke\u2019s in that Rousseau does not attach normativity to the\nprocess through which a civil state emerges from the state of nature.\nLegitimate political authority is created by convention, reached\nwithin the civil state. Specifically, Rousseau suggests that\nlegitimacy arises from the democratic justification of the laws of the\ncivil state (Social Contract I:6; cf. section 3.3.\nbelow).\n\nFor Immanuel Kant, as for Hobbes, political authority is created by\nthe establishment of political institutions in the civil state. It\ndoes not pre-exist in individuals in the state of nature. What exists\nin the pre-civil social state, according to Kant, is the moral\nauthority of each individual qua rational being and a moral obligation\nto form a civil state. Establishing a civil state is \u201cin itself\nan end (that each ought to have)\u201d (Kant, Theory and\nPractice 8:289; see also Perpetual Peace, Appendix I).\nKant regards the civil state as a necessary first step toward a moral\norder (the \u201cethical commonwealth\u201d). It helps people\nconform to certain rules by eliminating what today would be called the\nfree-riding problem or the problem of partial compliance. By creating\na coercive order of public legal justice, \u201ca great step is taken\ntoward morality (though it is not yet a moral step), toward being\nattached to this concept of duty even for its own sake\u201d (Kant,\nPerpetual Peace 8:376, notes to Appendix I; see also Riley\n1982: 129f).\n\nThe civil state, according to Kant, establishes the rights necessary\nto secure equal freedom. Unlike for Locke and his contemporary\nfollowers, however, coercive power is not a secondary feature of the\ncivil state, necessary to back up laws. According to Kant, coercion is\npart of the idea of rights. The thought can be explained as follows.\nCoercion is defined as a restriction of the freedom to pursue\none\u2019s own ends. Any right of a person\u2014independently of\nwhether it is respected or has been violated\u2014implies a\nrestriction for others. (cf. Kant, Theory and Practice, Part\n2; Ripstein 2004: 8; Flikschuh 2008: 389f). Coercion, in this view, is\nthus not merely a means for the civil state to enforce rights as\ndefenders of an authority-based concept of legitimacy claim. Instead,\naccording to Kant, it is constitutive of the civil state. This\nunderstanding of rights links Kant\u2019s conception of legitimacy to\nthe justification of coercion.\n\nLegitimacy, for Kant, depends on a particular interpretation of the\nsocial contract. For Kant, the social contract which establishes the\ncivil state is not an actual event. He accepts David Hume\u2019s\nobjection to Locke that the civil state is often established in an act\nof violence (Hume \u201cOf the Original Contract\u201d). Kant\ninvokes the social contract, instead, as the test \u201cof any public\nlaw\u2019s conformity with right\u201d (Kant Theory and\nPractice 8:294). The criterion is the following: each law should\nbe such that all individuals could have consented to it. The social\ncontract, according to Kant, is thus a hypothetical thought\nexperiment, meant to capture an idea of public reason. As such, it\nsets the standard for what counts as legitimate political authority.\nBecause of his particular interpretation of the social contract, Kant\nis not a social contract theorist in the strict sense. The idea of a\ncontract is nevertheless relevant for his understanding of legitimacy.\n(On the difference between voluntaristic and rationalistic strands in\nliberalism, see Waldron 1987.)\n\nKant, unlike Hobbes, recognizes the difference between legitimate and\neffective authority. For the head of the civil state is under an\nobligation to obey public reason and to enact only laws to which all\nindividuals could consent. If he violates this obligation, however, he\nstill holds authority, even if his authority ceases to be legitimate.\nThis view is best explained in relation to Kant\u2019s often\ncriticized position on the right to revolution. Kant famously denied\nthat there is a right to revolution (Kant, Perpetual Peace,\nAppendix II; for a recent discussion, see Flikschuh 2008). Kant\nstresses that while \u201ca people\u201d\u2014as united in the\ncivil state\u2014is sovereign, its individual members are under the\nobligation to obey the head of the state thus established. This\nobligation is such that it is incompatible with a right to revolution.\nKant offers a transcendental argument for his position (Kant\nPerpetual Peace, Appendix II; Arendt 1992). A right to\nrevolution would be in contradiction with the idea that individuals\nare bound by public law, but without the idea of citizens being bound\nby public law, there cannot be a civil state\u2014only anarchy. As\nmentioned earlier, however, there is a duty to establish a civil\nstate. Kant\u2019s position implies that the obligation of\nindividuals to obey a head of state is not conditioned upon the\nruler\u2019s performance. In particular, the obligation to obey does\nnot cease when the laws are unjust.\n\nKant\u2019s position on the right to revolution may suggest that he\nregards political authority as similarly absolute as Hobbes. But Kant\nstresses that the head of state is bound by the commands of public\nreason. This is manifest in his insistence on freedom of the pen:\n\u201ca citizen must have, with the approval of the ruler himself,\nthe authorization to make known publicly his opinions about what it is\nin the ruler\u2019s arrangements that seems to him to be a wrong\nagainst the commonwealth\u201d (Kant Theory and Practice\n8:304). While there is no right to revolution, political authority is\nonly legitimate if the head of state respects the social contract. But\npolitical obligations arise even from illegitimate authority. If the\nhead of state acts in violation of the social contract and hence of\npublic reason, for example by restricting citizens\u2019 freedom of\npolitical criticism, citizens are still obligated to obey.\n\nIn 2004, Ripstein argued that much of the contemporary literature on\npolitical legitimacy has been dominated by a focus on the\njustification of authority, rather than coercive political power\n(Ripstein 2004). In the literature since then, it looks as if the\ntables are turning, especially if one considers the debates on\ninternational and global legitimacy (section 5). But prominent earlier\ncoercion-based accounts include those by Nagel (1987) and by\ncontemporary Kantians such as Rawls and Habermas (to be discussed in\nsections 3.3. and 4.3., respectively).\n\nLet me briefly mention other important coercion-based interpretations.\nJean Hampton (1998; drawing on Anscombe 1981) offers an elegant\ncontemporary explication of Hobbes\u2019 view. According to her,\npolitical authority \u201cis invented by a group of people who\nperceive that this kind of special authority as necessary for the\ncollective solution of certain problems of interaction in their\nterritory and whose process of state creation essentially involves\ndesigning the content and structure of that authority so that it meets\nwhat they take to be their needs\u201d (Hampton 1998: 77). Her theory\nlinks the authority of the state to its ability to enforce a solution\nto coordination and cooperation problems. Coercion is the necessary\nfeature that enables the state to provide an effective solution to\nthese problems, and the entitlement to use coercion is what\nconstitutes the authority of the state. The entitlement to use\ncoercion distinguishes such minimally legitimate political authority\nfrom a mere use of power. Hampton draws a further distinction between\nminimal legitimacy and what she calls full moral legitimacy, which\nobtains when political authority is just.\n\nBuchanan (2002) also argues that legitimacy is concerned with the\njustification of coercive power. Buchanan points out that this makes\nlegitimacy a more fundamental normative concept than authority. Like\nHampton, he advocates a moralized interpretation of legitimacy.\nAccording to him, \u201can entity has political legitimacy if and\nonly if it is morally justified in wielding political power\u201d\n(2002: 689). Political authority, in his approach, obtains if an\nentity is legitimate in this sense and if some further conditions,\nrelating to political obligation, are met (2002: 691). Anna Stilz\n(2009) offers a coercion-centered account of state legitimacy that\ndraws on both Kant and Rousseau.\n2.3 Political Legitimacy and Political Obligations\n\nHistorically speaking, the dominant view has been that legitimate\npolitical authority entails political obligations. Locke, for example,\nwrites: \u201cevery man, by consenting with others to make one body\npolitic under one government, puts himself under an obligation to\nevery one of that society to submit to the determination of the\nmajority, and to be concluded by it; or else this original compact,\nwhereby he with others incorporates into one society, would signify\nnothing, and be no compact if he be left free and under no other ties\nthan he was in before in the state of nature\u201d (Locke 2009\n[1690]: 52f).\n\nWhile this is still the view many hold, not all do. Some take the\nquestion of what constitutes legitimate authority to be distinct from\nthe question of what political obligations people have. Ronald Dworkin\n(1986: 191) treats political obligations as a fundamental normative\nconcept in its own right. What he calls \u201cassociative\nobligations\u201d arise, not from legitimate political authority, but\ndirectly from membership in a political community. (For a critical\ndiscussion of this account, see Simmons 2001; Wellman 1996.)\n\nArthur Applbaum (2019) offers a conceptual argument to challenge the\nview that legitimate political authority entails an obligation to\nobey. Applbaum grants that legitimate political authority has the\ncapacity to change the normative status of those under its rule, as\nRaz (1986), for example, has influentially argued, and that this\ncapacity should be interpreted as a moral power in Hohfeld\u2019s\nsense, not as a claim right to rule. But, Applbaum argues, Hohfeldian\npowers, unlike rights, are not correlated with duties; they are\ncorrelated with liabilities. On Applbaum\u2019s view, legitimate\npolitical authority thus has the capacity to create a liability for\nthose under its rule, but not an obligation. To be liable to\nlegitimate political authority means to not be free from the\nauthority\u2019s power or control. To be sure, the liability might be\nto be subject to a duty, but to be liable to be put under a duty to\nobey should not be confused with being under a duty to obey (see also\nPerry 2013 on this distinction).\n\nViews that dissociate legitimate authority from political obligation\nhave some appeal to those who aim to counter Robert Paul Wolff\u2019s\ninfluential anarchist argument. The argument highlights what today is\nsometimes called the subjection problem (Perry 2013): how can\nautonomous individuals be under a\ngeneral\u2014content-independent\u2014obligation to subject their\nwill to the will of someone else? A content-independent obligation to\nobey the state is an obligation to obey a state\u2019s directives as\nsuch, independently of their content. Wolff (1970) argues that because\nthere cannot be such a general obligation to obey the state, states\nare necessarily illegitimate.\n\nEdmundson (1998) has a first response to the anarchist challenge. He\nargues that while legitimacy establishes a justification for the state\nto issue directives, it does not create even a prima facie duty to\nobey its commands. He claims that the moral duty to obey the commands\nof legitimate political authority arises only if additional conditions\nare met.\n\nSimmons (2001) has a different response to Wolff. Simmons draws a\ndistinction between the moral justification of states and the\npolitical legitimacy of a particular, historically realized, state and\nits directives. According to Simmons, the state\u2019s justification\ndepends on its moral defensibility. If it can successfully be shown\nthat having a state is morally better than not having a state (Simmons\n2001: 125), the state is justified. But moral justification is only\nnecessary, not sufficient, for political legitimacy, according to\nSimmons. The reason is that our moral obligations are to everyone,\nincluding citizens of other states, not to the particular state we\nlive in. A particular state\u2019s legitimacy, understood as the\ncapacity to generate and enforce a duty to obey, depends on\ncitizens\u2019 actual consent. While there is no general moral duty\nto obey the particular state we live in, we may have a political\nobligation to obey if we have given our prior consent to this state.\nThe absence of a general moral duty to obey the state thus does not\nimply that all states are necessarily illegitimate (Simmons 2001:\n137).\n3. Sources of Political Legitimacy\n\nInsofar as legitimacy, understood normatively, determines which\npolitical institutions and which decisions made within them are\njustified or acceptable, and, in some cases, what kind of obligations\npeople who are governed by these institutions incur, there is the\nquestion of what makes political institutions and political decisions\nlegitimate. As we\u2019ll see, this question has both a normative and\na meta-normative dimension (see Peter 2023 for more on this\ndistinction). This section briefly reviews different accounts that\nhave been given of the sources of legitimacy.\n3.1 Consent\n\nWhile there is a strong voluntarist line of thought in Christian\npolitical philosophy, it was in the 17th century that\nconsent came to be seen as the main source of political legitimacy.\nThe works of Hugo Grotius, Hobbes, and Samuel Pufendorf tend to be\nseen as the main turning point that eventually led to the replacement\nof natural law and divine authority theories of legitimacy (see\nSchneewind 1998; Hampton 1998). The following passage from\nGrotius\u2019 On the Law of War and Peace expresses the\nmodern perspective: \u201cBut as there are several Ways of Living,\nsome better than others, and every one may chuse which he pleases of\nall those Sorts; so a People may chuse what Form of Government they\nplease: Neither is the Right which the Sovereign has over his Subjects\nto be measured by this or that Form, of which divers Men have\ndifferent Opinions, but by the Extent of the Will of those who\nconferred it upon him\u201d (cited by Tuck 1993: 193). It was\nLocke\u2019s version of social contract theory that elevated consent\nto the main source of the legitimacy of political authority.\n\nRaz helpfully distinguishes among three ways in which the relation\nbetween consent and legitimate political authority may be understood\n(1995: 356): (i) consent of those governed is a necessary condition\nfor the legitimacy of political authority; (ii) consent is not\ndirectly a condition for legitimacy, but the conditions for the\nlegitimacy of authority are such that only political authority that\nenjoys the consent of those governed can meet them; (iii) the\nconditions of legitimate political authority are such that those\ngoverned by that authority are under an obligation to consent. There\nis a question, however, whether versions of (ii) and (iii) are best\nunderstood as versions of a consent theory of political legitimacy, or\nwhether they are versions of an alternative justificationist theory\n(Stark 2000; Peter 2023).\n\nLocke and his contemporary followers such as Robert Nozick (1974) or\nSimmons (2001), but also Rousseau and his followers defend a version\nof (i)\u2014the most typical form that consent theories take. Amanda\nGreene (2016) defends a version of this view she calls the quality\nconsent view. One question that all versions of (i) must address is\nwhether consent must be explicit or whether tacit consent, expressed\nby residency, is sufficient (see Puryear 2021 for a defence of the\nlatter).\n\nVersions of (ii) appeal to those who reject actual consent as a basis\nfor legitimacy, as they only regard consent given under ideal\nconditions as binding. Theories of hypothetical consent, such as those\narticulated by Kant or Rawls, fall into this category. Such theories\nview political authority as legitimate only if those governed would\nconsent under certain ideal conditions (cf. section 3.2).\n\nDavid Estlund (2008: 117ff) defends a version of hypothetical consent\ntheory that matches category (iii). What he calls \u201cnormative\nconsent\u201d is a theory that regards non-consent to authority,\nunder certain conditions as invalid. Authority, in this view, may thus\nbe justified without actual consent. Estlund defines authority as the\nmoral power to require action. Estlund uses normative consent theory\nas the basis for an account of democratic legitimacy, understood as\nthe permissibility of using coercion to enforce authority. The work\nthat normative consent theory does in Estlund\u2019s account is that\nit contributes to the justification of the authority of the democratic\ncollective over those who disagree with certain democratically\napproved laws.\n\nAlthough consent theory has been dominating for a long time, there are\nmany well-known objections to it. As we will explain more fully in the\nnext section, Simmons (2001) argues that hypothetical consent theories\n(and, presumably, normative consent theories, too) conflate moral\njustification with legitimation, and that only actual consent can\nlegitimize political institutions. Other objections, especially to\nLockean versions, are about as old as consent theory itself. David\nHume, in his essay \u201cOf the Original Contract\u201d, and many\nafter him object to Locke that consent is not feasible, and that\nactual states have almost always arisen from acts of violence. The\nattempt to legitimize political authority via consent is thus, at\nbest, wishful thinking (Wellman 1996). What is worse, it may obscure\nproblematic structures of subordination (Pateman 1988). Hume\u2019s\nown solution to this problem was, like Bentham later, to propose to\njustify political authority with reference to its beneficial\nconsequences (see section 3.3).\n3.2 Public Justification and Political Participation\n\nAn important legacy of consent theory in contemporary thought is\nmanifest in accounts that attribute the source of legitimacy either to\nan idea of public reason\u2014taking the lead from Kant\u2014or to a\ntheory of democratic participation\u2014taking the lead from\nRousseau. Theories of deliberative democracy combine elements of both\naccounts.\n\nPublic reason accounts tend to focus on the problem of justifying\npolitical coercion. The solution they propose is that political\ncoercion is justified if it is supported on the basis of reasons that\nall reasonable persons can share. Interest in public reason accounts\nstarted with Rawls\u2019 Political Liberalism, but Rawls\ndeveloped the idea more fully in later works. Rawls\u2019\nstarting-point is the following problem of legitimacy (Rawls 2001:\n41): \u201cin the light of what reasons and values \u2026 can\ncitizens legitimately exercise \u2026 coercive power over one\nanother?\u201d The solution to this problem that Rawls proposes is\nthe following \u201cliberal principle of legitimacy\u201d:\n\u201cpolitical power is legitimate only when it is exercised in\naccordance with a constitution (written or unwritten) the essentials\nof which all citizens, as reasonable and rational, can endorse in the\nlight of their common human reason\u201d (Rawls 2001: 41; see\nMichelman 2022 for an extensive discussion of constitutional\nessentials).\n\nRawls\u2019 idea of public reason, which is at the core of the\nliberal principle of legitimacy, rests on the method of\n\u201cpolitical\u201d\u2014as opposed to\n\u201cmetaphysical\u201d\u2014justification that Rawls has\ndeveloped in response to critics of his theory of justice as fairness\n(Rawls 1993). This means that public reason should be\n\u201cfreestanding\u201d in the same way as his theory of justice\nis. Public reason should involve only political values and be\nindependent of\u2014potentially controversial\u2014comprehensive\nmoral or religious doctrines of the good. This restricts the content\nof public reason to what is given by the family of what Rawls calls\npolitical conceptions of justice (Rawls 2001: 26). Rawls recognizes\nthat because the content of the idea of public reason is restricted,\nthe domain to which it should apply must be restricted too. The\nquestion is: in what context is it important that the restriction on\nreason is observed? Rawls conceives of the domain of public reason as\nlimited to matters of constitutional essentials and basic justice and\nas applying primarily\u2014but not only\u2014to judges, government\nofficials, and candidates for public office when they decide on\nmatters of constitutional essentials and basic justice.\n\nSimmons (2001) criticizes Rawls\u2019 approach for mistakenly\nblurring the distinction between justifying the state and political\nlegitimacy (see also section 2.3.). A Rawlsian could reply, however,\nthat the problem of legitimacy centrally involves the justification of\ncoercion, and that legitimacy should thus be understood as what\ncreates\u2014rather than merely justifies\u2014political authority.\nThe following thought supports this claim. Rawls\u2014in\nPolitical Liberalism\u2014explicitly focuses on the\ndemocratic context. It is a particular feature of democracy that the\nright to rule is created by those who are ruled. As Hershovitz puts it\nin his critique of the Razian approach to political legitimacy, in a\ndemocracy there is no sharp division between the \u201cbinders\u201d\nand the \u201cbound\u201d (2003: 210f). The political authority of\ndemocracy is thus entailed by some account of the conditions under\nwhich citizens may legitimately exercise coercive power over one\nanother (see Viehoff 2014 and Kolodny 2023 on this question). But even\nif Simmons\u2019 objection can be refuted in this way, a further\nproblem for public reason accounts is whether they can successfully\nshow that some form of public justification is indeed required for\npolitical legitimacy (see Enoch 2015).\n\nRecent public reason accounts have developed Rawls\u2019 original\nidea in different ways (see also the entry on public reason). Those\nfollowing Rawls more closely will understand public reasons as reasons\nthat attract a\u2014hypothetical\u2014consensus. On this\ninterpretation, a public reason is a reason that all reasonable\npersons can be expected to endorse. The target of the consensus is\neither the political decisions themselves or the procedure through\nwhich political decisions are made. On a common reading today, the\nRawlsian idea of public reason is understood in terms of a\nhypothetical consensus on substantive reasons (e.g., Quong 2011;\nHartley and Watson 2018). On those conceptions, the use of political\ncoercion is legitimate if it is supported by substantive reasons that\nall reasonable persons can be expected to endorse. The problem with\nthis interpretation of public reason is that the demand for a\nconsensus on substantive reasons in circumstances of moral and\nreligious pluralism and disagreement either relies on a very\nrestrictive characterization of reasonable persons or ends up with a\nvery limited domain for legitimate political coercion.\n\nRawls\u2019 conception of political legitimacy can also be understood\nin terms of procedural reasons (Peter 2008). On this interpretation,\nthe domain of public reason is limited to the justification of the\nprocess of political decision-making, and need not extend to the\nsubstantive (as opposed to the procedural) reasons that justify a\ndecision. For example, if public reason supports democratic\ndecision-making, then the justification for a decision is that it has\nbeen made democratically. Of course, a political decision that is\nlegitimate in virtue of the procedure in which it has been made may\nnot be fully just. But this is just a reflection of the fact that\nlegitimacy is a weaker idea than justice.\n\nAn alternative interpretation of the public reason account focuses on\nconvergence, not consensus (Gaus 2011; Vallier 2011; Vallier and\nMuldoon 2020). A political decision is legitimized on the basis of\npublic reason, on this account, if reasonable persons can converge on\nthat decision. They need not agree on the\u2014substantive or\nprocedural\u2014reasons that support a decision. Instead, it is\nargued, it is sufficient for political legitimacy if all can agree\nthat a particular decision should be made, even if they disagree about\nthe reasons that support this decision. Note that the convergence\nneeds not be actual; it can be hypothetical.\n\nAccounts that emphasize political participation or political influence\nregard a political decision as legitimate only if it has been made in\na process that allows for equal participation of all relevant persons.\nThey thus see political legitimacy as dependent on the participation\nor influence of all, to paraphrase Bernard Manin\u2019s (1987)\nexpression, not on the will of all, as consent theories do, or on a\njustification all can access, as public reason accounts do. Older\naccounts of this kind focus on democratic participation (Pateman\n1970). Newer accounts include deliberative democracy accounts (Manin\n1987), Philipp Pettit\u2019s equal control view (Pettit 2012), and\nLafont\u2019s theory of democratic legitimacy (Lafont 2019).\n\nRousseau\u2019s solution to the problem of how to explain the\nlegitimacy of political decisions has influenced many contemporary\ndemocratic theorists (see section 4.3.). One of the important\ndepartures from Locke\u2019s version of social contract theory that\nRousseau proposes is that tacit consent is not sufficient for\npolitical legitimacy. Without citizens\u2019 active participation in\nthe justification of a state\u2019s laws, Rousseau maintains, there\nis no legitimacy. According to Rousseau, one\u2019s will cannot be\nrepresented, as this would distort the general will, which alone is\nthe source of legitimacy: \u201cThe engagements that bind us to the\nsocial body are obligatory only because they are mutual\u2026 the\ngeneral will, to be truly such, should be general in its object as\nwell as in its essence; \u2026 it should come from all to apply to\nall; and \u2026 it loses its natural rectitude when it is directed\ntowards any individual, determinate object\u201d (Rousseau,\nSocial Contract, II:4; see also ibid. I:3 and Rawls\n2007: 231f).\n\nRousseau distinguishes among a citizen\u2019s private will, which\nreflects personal interests, a citizen\u2019s general will, which\nreflects an interpretation of the common good, and the general will,\nwhich truly reflects the common good. A democratic decision is always\nabout the common good. In democratic decision-making, citizens thus\ncompare their interpretations of the general will. If properly\nconducted, it reveals the general will. This is the legitimate\ndecision.\n\nActive participation by all may not generate a consensus. So why would\nthose who oppose a particular decision be bound by that decision?\nRousseau\u2019s answer to this question is the following. On\nRousseau\u2019s view, citizens can\u2014and will want to\u2014learn\nfrom democratic decisions. Since the democratic decision, if conducted\nproperly, correctly reveals the general will, those who voted against\na particular proposal will recognize that they were wrong and will\nadjust their beliefs about what the general will is. In this ingenious\nway, individuals are only bound by their own will, but everyone is\nbound by a democratic decision.\n3.3 Normative Facts and Epistemic Advantage\n\nThe theories of political legitimacy reviewed in the previous two\nsections take the citizens\u2019 will, whether expressed through\ntheir actual consent, supported by shared or converging reasons, or\nestablished through processes of political participation, as the\nground of political legitimacy. While such will-based conceptions have\ndominated the philosophical literature on political legitimacy, they\nare not the only conceptions on offer. There are two main\nalternatives, as well as hybrid conceptions (see Peter 2023). A first\nalternative are fact-based conceptions of political legitimacy,\naccording to which the legitimacy of political institutions and\ndecisions depends on whether they accord with normative facts.\nUtilitarian theories, which focus on the beneficial consequences of\npolitical institutions and the decisions made within them, are a good\nexample. According to belief-based conceptions, as articulated in\nepistocratic conceptions and in some epistemic theories of democracy,\nthe source of political legitimacy is some form of epistemic advantage\nthat supports the justification of political decisions. In this\nsection, we expand on the two main alternatives to will-based\nconceptions of political legitimacy.\n\nIn the utilitarian view, legitimate political authority should be\ngrounded on the principle of utility. The relevant normative facts are\nfacts concerning the maximization of happiness or utility. Christian\nThomasius, a student of Pufendorf and contemporary of Locke, may be\nseen as a precursor of the utilitarian approach to political\nlegitimacy, as he rejected voluntarism and endorsed the idea that\npolitical legitimacy depends on principles of rational prudence\ninstead (Schneewind 1998: 160; Barnard 2001: 66). Where Thomasius\ndiffers from the utilitarians, however, is in his attempt to identify\na distinctively political\u2014not moral or legal\u2014source of\nlegitimacy. He developed the idea of \u201cdecorum\u201d into a\ntheory of how people should relate to one another in the political\ncontext. Decorum is best described as a principle of \u201ccivic\nmutuality\u201d (Barnard 2001: 65): \u201cYou treat others as you\nwould expect them to treat you\u201d (Thomasius, Foundations of\nthe Law of Nature and of Nations, quoted by Barnard 2001: 65). By\nthus distinguishing legitimacy from legality and justice, Thomasius\nadopted an approach that was considerably ahead of his time.\n\nJeremy Bentham (in Anarchical Fallacies) rejects the\nHobbesian idea that political authority is created by a social\ncontract. According to Bentham, it is the state that creates the\npossibility of binding contracts. The problem of legitimacy that the\nstate faces is which of its laws are justified. Bentham proposes that\nlegitimacy depends on whether a law contributes to the happiness of\nthe citizens. (For a contemporary take on this utilitarian principle\nof legitimacy, see Binmore 2000.)\n\nA well-known problem with the view that Bentham articulates is that it\njustifies restrictions of rights that liberals find unacceptable. John\nStuart Mill\u2019s answer to this objection consists, on the one\nhand, in an argument for the compatibility between utilitarianism and\nthe protection of liberty rights and, on the other, in an\ninstrumentalist defense of democratic political authority based on the\nprinciple of utility. According to Mill, both individual freedom and\nthe right to participate in politics are necessary for the\nself-development of individuals (Mill On Liberty and\nConsiderations on Representative Government, see Brink 1992;\nTen 1998).\n\nWith regard to the defense of liberty rights, Mill argues that the\nrestriction of liberty is illegitimate unless it is permitted by the\nharm principle, that is, unless the actions suppressed by the\nrestriction harm others (On Liberty, chapter 1; for a\ncritical discussion of the harm principle as the basis of legitimacy,\nsee Wellman 1996; see also Turner 2014). Mill\u2019s view of the\ninstrumental value of (deliberative) democracy is expressed in the\nfollowing passage of the first chapter of On Liberty:\n\u201cDespotism is a legitimate mode of government in dealing with\nbarbarians, provided that the end be their improvement and the means\njustified by actually effecting that end. Liberty, as a principle, has\nno application to any state of things anterior to the time when\nmankind have become capable of being improved by free and equal\ndiscussion.\u201d Deliberation is important, according to Mill,\nbecause of his belief in the power of ideas\u2014in what Habermas\nwould later call the force of the better argument (Habermas 1990:\n158ff). Deliberation should keep partisan interests, which could\nthreaten legitimacy by undermining the general happiness, in check:\n\u201cThe representative system ought \u2026 not to allow any of\nthe various sectional interests to be so powerful as to be capable of\nprevailing against truth and justice and the other sectional interests\ncombined. There ought always to be such a balance preserved among\npersonal interests as may render any one of them dependent for its\nsuccesses, on carrying with it at least a large proportion of those\nwho act on higher motives, and more comprehensive and distant\nviews\u201d (Mill, Collected Works XIX: 447, cited by Ten\n1998: 379).\n\nMany are not convinced that such instrumentalist reasoning provides a\nsatisfactory account of political legitimacy. Rawls (1971:175ff) and\nJeremy Waldron (1987: 143ff) object that the utilitarian approach will\nultimately only convince those who stand to benefit from the felicific\ncalculus, and that it lacks an argument to convince those who stand to\nlose.\n\nCan fact-based conceptions of political legitimacy address this\nproblem? Fair play theories offer one solution to this problem (see\nKlosko 2004 and the entry on\n political obligation).\n Wellman\u2019s (1996) samaritan account of political legitimacy is\nalso an attempt to overcome this problem. In his account, a\nstate\u2019s legitimacy depends on it being justified to use coercion\nto enforce its laws. His suggestion is that the justification of the\nstate can be grounded in the samaritan duty to help others in need.\nThe thought is that \u201cwhat ultimately legitimizes a state\u2019s\nimposition upon your liberty is not merely the services it\nprovides you, but the benefits it provides\nothers\u201d (Wellman 1996: 213; his emphasis). Wellman\nargues that because \u201cpolitical society is the only vehicle with\nwhich people can escape the perils of the state of nature\u201d\n(Wellman 1996: 216), people have a samaritan duty to provide to one\nanother the benefits of a state. Associated restrictions of their\nliberty by the state, Wellman claims, are legitimate.\n\nPerfectionist theories offer another alternative. Perfectionist\nconceptions can be found in ancient Chinese philosophy (see Chan 2013;\nJiang 2021). The best-known perfectionist theory in contemporary\nWestern political philosophy is Raz\u2019 service conception of\nlegitimate authority (section 2.1). Raz tries to show how an account\nof legitimacy based on beneficial consequences is compatible with\neveryone having reasons to obey the directives of a legitimate\nauthority. According to Raz (1995: 359), \u201c[g]overnments decide\nwhat is best for their subjects and present them with the results as\nbinding conclusions that they are bound to follow.\u201d The\njustification for this view that Raz gives (\u201cthe normal\njustification thesis\u201d) is, as explained above, that if the\nauthority is legitimate, its directives are such that they help those\ngoverned to better comply with reasons that apply to them. (For\ncriticisms of this approach, see Hershovitz 2003 and 2011, Nussbaum\n2011, and Quong 2011).\n\nPerfectionist theories are often cast as versions of fact-based\nconceptions of political legitimacy. But, as Plato highlighted in the\nRepublic, there isn\u2019t just the question of what the\nright political decisions are, whether construed as those that\nmaximize utility, honor our duties, or realize some perfectionist\nideal. There is also the question of who should be in charge. And the\nanswer that Plato gave to that second question echoes a belief-based\nconception of political legitimacy: it\u2019s those who know best and\nwho are capable of ruling accordingly (Estlund 2003). Seen in that\nlight, even Raz\u2019 service conception of political legitimacy\nappears as a belief-based conception. It holds that \u201cepistemic\nabstinence\u201d is not an option (Raz 1995) and that political\nauthority is legitimate if held by those who know best what reasons\napply to all citizens and exercised accordingly (see Peter 2023 for\nthis interpretation of Raz\u2019 service conception).\n\nBelief-based conceptions of political legitimacy span versions of\nepistocracy as well as versions of epistemic democracy. I\u2019ll\nhave more to say about epistemic democracy in section 4, so let me\nfocus on epistocratic conceptions here. Epistocratic conceptions of\npolitical legitimacy are best understood in opposition to the\ndemocratic commitment to strict political equality among the citizens\n(see section 4). The idea is captured by Jason Brennan\u2019s\n\u201cantiauthority tenet\u201d (Brennan 2016: 17), which echoes\nDavid Estlund\u2019s \u201cauthority tenet\u201d (2008: 30):\n\u201cWhen some citizens are morally unreasonable, ignorant, or\nincompetent about politics, this justifies not permitting them to\nexercise political authority over others.\u201d\n\nEpistocratic conceptions of political legitimacy can support the\nlegitimacy of authoritarianism, assuming that there is an\nauthoritarian elite that has the right kind of political knowledge and\nis able to effectively rule on that basis. We should not equate\nepistocracy with authoritarianism, however, as epistocracy is also\ncompatible with a Millian plurality voting scheme and similar\npolitical regimes. Still, as highlighted by Ross Mittiga (2022) and\nFabienne Peter (2023), the question has to be addressed whether\nnon-democratic political decision-making can be legitimate in\ncircumstances where the threats to citizens\u2019 lives are enormous\n(through climate change, for example, or pandemics), the evidence for\nwhat needs to be done is sufficiently robust, and the democratic\nprocess is failing to address the issues.\n\nAn important objection to belief-based conceptions of political\nlegitimacy is that they conflate political authority and epistemic\nauthority (Estlund 2008, Darwall 2010, Lafont 2019; see also section 4\nbelow). Raz (2010) rejects this objection, arguing that it only shows\nthat epistemic authority is not sufficient for political authority,\nnot that it is not necessary. Peter (2023) argues that even if this\nobjection can be refuted, belief-based conceptions of political\nlegitimacy often (but not necessarily always) fail because political\ndecision-making remains epistemically underdetermined.\n4. Political Legitimacy and Democracy\n\nThis section takes a closer look at the relationship between democracy\nand political legitimacy. In contemporary political philosophy, many,\nbut by no means all, hold that democracy is necessary for political\nlegitimacy. Democratic instrumentalism is the view that democratic\ndecision-making procedures are at best a means for reaching just\noutcomes, and whether or not legitimacy requires democracy depends on\nthe outcomes that democratic decision-making brings about. Thomas\nChristiano (2004) helpfully distinguishes between monistic conceptions\nof political legitimacy and non-monistic ones. Democratic\ninstrumentalism is a monistic view. It reduces the normativity of\npolitical legitimacy to a single dimension: only the quality of the\noutcomes a particular political regime generates is relevant for\npolitical legitimacy. The main alternative in contemporary political\nphilosophy is a form of proceduralism according to which democracy is\nnecessary for political legitimacy, independently of its instrumental\nvalue (Buchanan 2002). Some such proceduralist conceptions of\ndemocratic legitimacy are also monistic. What is commonly called pure\nproceduralism is an example of a monistic view. According to pure\nproceduralism only procedural features of decision-making are relevant\nfor democratic legitimacy. Many philosophers are drawn to non-monistic\nconceptions of democratic legitimacy. Such mixed conceptions of\ndemocratic legitimacy combine conditions that refer to the quality of\noutcomes of democratic decision-making with conditions that apply to\nprocedural features.\n4.1 Democratic Instrumentalism\n\nDemocratic instrumentalism is sometimes used to argue against\ndemocracy. According to arguments of this kind, some ideal of good\noutcomes, however defined, forms the standard that determines\npolitical legitimacy (see section 3.3). If democracy does not\ncontribute to better outcomes than an alternative decision-making\nprocedure, it is not necessary for political legitimacy. The\ninstrumentalist accounts of Richard Arneson (2003) and Steven Wall\n(2007), for example, refer to some ideal egalitarian distribution. In\ntheir view, the legitimacy of political institutions and the decisions\nmade within them depends on how closely they approximate the ideal\negalitarian distribution. If sacrificing political equality allows for\na better approximation of equality overall, so their argument goes,\nthen this does not undermine legitimacy.\n\nOne problem with this view is that it treats political equality as\nless important than the other kinds of equality that inform the\nperfectionist standard. This is implausible to those who take\npolitical equality to be one of the most important egalitarian values\n(e.g., Rawls 1993; Buchanan 2002; Christiano 2008). In addition,\nanti-democratic instrumentalism is at odds with the view that many\ndemocrats hold\u2014that democratic procedures create or constitute\npolitical authority (Viehoff 2014, Kolodny 2023).\n\nInstrumentalist defenses of democracy aim to show that democratic\ndecision-making procedures are legitimate because they are best able\nto produce the right outcomes. Many of those arguments for the\nlegitimacy of democracy focus on the (instrumental) epistemic value of\ndemocratic decision-making procedures. I\u2019ll discuss these in a\nmoment. But, first, it\u2019s important to note that not all do. A\nfact-based version of democratic instrumentalism holds that democratic\ndecision-processes are legitimate to the extent that they, in fact,\npromote morally good or just outcomes. Amartya Sen\u2019s finding\nthat democracies prevent famines illustrates the idea (Sen 1999).\nBrinkmann (2019) argues that there is an indirect version of\ninstrumentalism about political legitimacy, which ties legitimacy to\njustice, but that is less vulnerable to standard objections against\ninstrumentalism. This indirect instrumentalism, he argues, can support\nthe legitimacy of democratic procedures.\n\nEpistemic justifications of democracy do not always target the\nlegitimacy of democracy. Some just aim to add to our overall\nunderstanding of the justification of democracy, without claiming that\nthe epistemic argument provided is sufficient to establish the\nlegitimacy of democracy. Some pragmatist epistemic defences of\ndemocracy, which need not be instrumentalist, are best interpreted\nalong those lines (e.g., Misak 2004, Talisse 2009). But to the extent\nthat they do target legitimacy, epistemic instrumentalist defenses of\ndemocracy rely on what Estlund calls a \u201ccorrectness theory of\ndemocratic legitimacy\u201d (Estlund 2008: 99). According to this\ntheory, democracy is necessary for legitimacy to the extent that it\ngenerates political decisions that are correct or more likely to be\ncorrect.\n\nThe best-known epistemic instrumentalist defense of democracy draws on\nthe Condorcet jury theorem (see Goodin and Spiekermann 2019 for a\ncomprehensive recent discussion). In its original formulation, the\nCondorcet jury theorem assumes that there are two alternatives and one\nof them is the correct outcome, however defined. Take the latter to be\nthe legitimate outcome. The theorem says that if each voter is more\nlikely to be correct than wrong, then a majority of all is also more\nlikely to be correct than wrong. In addition, the probability that a\nmajority will vote for the correct outcome increases with the size of\nthe body of voters. Since democracy has a greater constituency than\nany other regime, the theorem gives an argument for why democracy is\nbest able to generate legitimate outcomes. Bernard Grofman and Scott\nFeld (1988) interpret the Condorcet jury theorem as an explanation of\nRousseau\u2019s theory of how a democratic decision reflects the\ngeneral will.\n\nIn addition to arguments based on the Condorcet jury theorem, there\nare other ways to defend the instrumental epistemic value of\ndemocracy. The main alternative to the jury theorem is a\ndiversity-based mechanism. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Landemore (2012, 2020)\ndraws on work by Lu Hong and Scott Page (2004) to argue that by\nbringing together diverse perspectives, democratic decision-making can\noutperform decision-making by less diverse groups, e.g., groups of\nexperts.\n\nCristina Lafont (2019) objects that such epistemic instrumentalist\narguments misconstrue the grounds of political legitimacy, echoing\nobjections against epistocracy (section 3.3). According to Lafont,\nepistemic arguments for democracy imply that citizens ought to defer\nonce the correct decision is identified. But, Lafont argues, the\nunique legitimacy of democracy stems from honoring each\ncitizen\u2019s equal political authoritativeness and seeing each\ncitizen as an addressee of political justification, not as a\nco-supplier of information for tracking a correct answer to a\nquestion. This blocks a requirement to blindly defer to others \u2013\na point she argues is lost in epistemic instrumentalist theories of\ndemocratic legitimacy.\n4.2 Pure Proceduralist Conceptions of Democratic Legitimacy\n\nAccording to pure proceduralist conceptions of democratic legitimacy,\ndemocratic decisions are legitimate as long as they are the result of\nan appropriately constrained process of democratic decision-making.\nThese views place all the normative weight on the democratic\nprocedure.\n\nThere are several ways in which pure proceduralism might be\nunderstood. On an account of aggregative democracy\u2014which takes\nthe aggregation of individual preferences, for example through voting,\nto be the key feature of democracy\u2014pure proceduralism implies\nthat democratic decisions are legitimate if the aggregative process is\nfair. Kenneth May\u2019s defense of majority rule (May 1952) relies\non a view of this sort (see also Dahl 1956).\n\nOn a deliberative account of democracy, legitimacy depends, at least\nin part, on the process of public deliberation (Manin 1987; Bohman\n1996; Gutmann and Thompson 1996). Thomas Christiano has a good\ncharacterization of what pure proceduralism entails in an account of\ndeliberative democracy: \u201cdemocratic discussion, deliberation,\nand decisionmaking under certain conditions are what make the outcomes\nlegitimate for each person. \u2026 [W]hatever the results of\ndiscussions, deliberation, and decisionmaking \u2026, they are\nlegitimate. The results are made legitimate by being the results of\nthe procedure\u201d (Christiano 1996: 35). The idea is that while\ndemocratic deliberation helps sorting through reasons for and against\nparticular candidates or policy proposals, and perhaps even generates\nnew alternatives, the legitimacy of the outcomes of such a process\nonly depends on the fairness of the decision-making process, not on\nthe quality of the outcomes it produces. The justification for\nconceptions of democratic legitimacy of this kind is that there is no\nshared standard for assessing the quality of the outcomes\u2014deep\ndisagreement about reasons for and against proposals will always\nremain. A fair way to resolve such disagreements is thus the only\nsource of the legitimacy of the outcomes (Waldron 1996; Gaus 1997;\nChristiano 2008).\n\nEstlund (2008) has raised a challenge against fairness-based versions\nof democratic proceduralism. He points out that other decision-making\nprocedures\u2014flipping a coin, for example\u2014also satisfy a\nfairness requirement. An argument from fairness is thus insufficient\nto establish the superior legitimacy of democratic decision-making.\nPure proceduralists can respond to this challenge by pointing to the\ndistinctive fairness of democratic decision-making procedures. They\ncan argue that the legitimacy of democratically made decisions stems\nfrom the kind of political equality realized only by democracy.\nAccording to Christiano (2008), only in a democracy are people\npublicly treated as equals. According to Viehoff (2014) and Kolodny\n(2023), only a democracy secures the kind of relational equality that\navoids subordinating some citizens to the decisions of others.\n\nAnother response to Estlund\u2019s challenge against fairness-based\narguments is to focus on the kind of freedom that democracy offers,\nrather than on egalitarian considerations. Pettit\u2019s equal\ncontrol view, already mentioned in sections 1 and 3.3, rests on this\nstrategy. Pettit\u2019s republican theory defends democracy as\nuniquely able to secure the non-domination of the citizens. Lafont\n(2019) defends the legitimacy of democracy on the basis of its link to\nself-governance (see the discussion of her view in section 4.1).\n\nA different proceduralist response to Estlund\u2019s challenge is to\npoint to the procedural epistemic values that the democratic process\nrealizes\u2014on how inclusive it is, for example, or how thoroughly\nthe knowledge claims on which particular proposals rest have been\nsubjected to criticism. The thought is that political legitimacy may\nbe jeopardized not just by unequal access to political, social and\neconomic institutions, but also by unjustified epistemic privilege.\nWhat Peter calls pure epistemic proceduralism is a conception of\ndemocratic legitimacy according to which political decisions are\nlegitimate if they are the outcome of a deliberative democratic\ndecision-making process that satisfies some conditions of political\nand epistemic fairness (Peter 2008).\n4.3 Alternative Conceptions of Democratic Legitimacy\n\nSome conceptions of democratic legitimacy seek to reconcile\ninstrumentalist and non-instrumentalist considerations. What we may\ncall rational proceduralist conceptions of democratic legitimacy add\nconditions that refer to the quality of outcomes to those that apply\nto the procedural properties of democratic decision-making.\n\nAs is the case with pure proceduralist conceptions, rational\nproceduralist conceptions of democratic legitimacy also vary with the\nunderlying account of democracy. A version of rational proceduralism\nis implicit in Arrow\u2019s approach to aggregative democracy (Arrow\n1963; see Peter 2008 for a discussion). The problem he poses is: are\nthere methods of democratic decision-making that are based on equal\nconsideration of individual interests and are conducive to rational\nsocial choice? As is well known, his impossibility theorem shows a\nproblem with finding such decision-making mechanisms. Arrow\u2019s\nway of posing the problem\u2014which contrasts with May\u2019s\n(1952)\u2014suggests that the possible irrationality of majority rule\nundermines its legitimacy, even if it respects certain procedural\nvalues. His view implies that democratic legitimacy only obtains if\nthe outcomes themselves satisfy certain quality\nconditions\u2014specifically, he postulated that they should satisfy\ncertain rationality axioms.\n\nThe default conception of democratic legitimacy that many deliberative\ndemocrats favor is also a version of rational proceduralism.\nHabermas\u2019 conception of democratic legitimacy is an example.\nDrawing on discourse ethics, Habermas (1990; 1996) argues that\npeople\u2019s participation in the justificatory processes of\ndeliberative democracy is necessary for political legitimacy.\nAccording to him, \u201cthe procedures and communicative\npresuppositions of democratic opinion- and will-formation function as\nthe most important sluices for the discursive rationalization of the\ndecisions of an administration bound by law and statute\u201d (1996:\n300). The legitimacy of democratic decisions, then, depends on both\nprocedural values and on the substantive quality of the outcomes that\nthese deliberative decision-making procedures generate. As Habermas\nputs it: \u201cDeliberative politics acquires its legitimating force\nfrom the discursive structure of an opinion- and will-formation that\ncan fulfill its socially integrative function only because citizens\nexpect its results to have a reasonable quality\u201d\n(Habermas 1996: 304; see also Benhabib 1994; Knight and Johnson 1994;\nCohen 1997a,b; Bohman 1997). In his view, only deliberative democratic\ndecision-making can produce a decision everyone has reasons to\nendorse.\n\nEstlund objects to both pure proceduralist and the versions of\nrational proceduralism just discussed that they unduly neglect\nepistemic considerations. But he also objects to epistemic\ninstrumentalist accounts that they fail to give a sufficient\nexplanation for why those who disagree with the outcome of the\ndemocratic decision-making process ought to treat it as binding. To\ncorrect for that, Estlund\u2019s alternative conception of democratic\nlegitimacy puts more emphasis on procedures while still giving weight\nto epistemic considerations. The conception of legitimacy that he\nadvocates \u201crequires that the procedure can be held, in terms\nacceptable to all qualified points of view, to be epistemically the\nbest (or close to it) among those that are better than random\u201d\n(Estlund 2008: 98). By privileging what he calls the \u201cqualified\nacceptability requirement\u201d (2008: 40ff) over epistemic\nconsiderations, Estlund avoids the worry about political deference\nthat drives Lafont\u2019s (2019) rejection of epistemic theories of\ndemocratic legitimacy.\n\nAs we saw, worries about political deference are an important source\nfor scepticism about both epistocratic and epistemic democracy\ntheories of legitimacy (see also van Wietmarschen 2019, Lillehammer\n2021, and Brinkmann 2022 on political deference). Peter (2023), by\ncontrast, argues that these principled worries about political\ndeference are overstated and that legitimate political decision-making\nmay be compatible with a requirement to politically defer, even in a\nsystem that is overall democratic.\n5. Legitimacy and Political Cosmopolitanism\n\nPolitical cosmopolitanism about political legitimacy is the view that\nnational communities are not the exclusive source of political\nlegitimacy in the global realm. This is a minimal characterization. It\nis compatible with a system in which nation states and their\ngovernments remain the main political agents, as long as there is some\nattribution of legitimate political authority to international\nconventions. For even if states and their governments are the main\npolitical entities, there is still the question about appropriate\nrelations among national actors. When should nation states recognize\nanother political entity as legitimate? And what are appropriate\nsanctions against entities that do not meet the legitimacy criteria?\nCall this the problem of international legitimacy.\n\nPolitical cosmopolitanism is also compatible with the much more\ndemanding idea of replacing nation states and national\ngovernments\u2014at least in certain policy areas\u2014by global\ninstitutions. Examples of relevant policy areas are trade or the\nenvironment. The associated global institutions may include both\nglobal rules (e.g., the rules of the WTO treaty) and global political\nagents (e.g., the UN General Assembly). This raises the question of\nwhat conditions such global governance institutions have to satisfy in\norder to qualify as legitimate. Call this the problem of global\nlegitimacy.\n5.1 Political Nationalism\n\nThe more familiar, contrasting position is political nationalism. It\nis the view that only the political institutions of nation states pose\nand can overcome the legitimacy problem and hence be a source of\npolitical legitimacy. Political nationalism is usually defended on the\ngrounds that there is something unique either about the coercion\ndeployed by states or about the political authority which states\npossess which needs justification (see Stilz 2019 and Sadurski, Sevel,\nand Walton 2019 for recent explorations of these issues).\n\nPolitical nationalism has had much influence on debates on global\njustice. Some have argued that because moral cosmopolitan commitments\ntrump commitments to (national) legitimacy, a conception of global\njustice can be detached from concerns with legitimacy (Beitz 1979a,b,\n1998; Pogge 2008). Others have argued\u2014again assuming political\nnationalism\u2014that legitimate authority at the level of the nation\nstate is necessary to pursue moral cosmopolitan goals (Ypi 2008\nprovides an empirical argument). Yet others have argued against the\nidea of global justice altogether, on the grounds that political\nlegitimacy ties obligations of justice to nation states (Blake 2001;\nNagel 2005). What these approaches to global justice have failed to\naddress is the possibility of sound political cosmopolitan conceptions\nof political legitimacy. Nicole Hassoun (2012) takes this issue as her\nstarting-point. She argues that the coercive power of global\ngovernance institutions raises a legitimacy problem of its own and,\nturning the arguments of Michael Blake (2001) and Thomas Nagel (2005)\non their heads, that securing the legitimacy of those institutions\nentails obligations of global justice. (See also Aytac 2022 on this,\nwho approaches the issue from political realist perspective.)\n5.2 Political Cosmopolitanism\n\nThere are two main approaches to both international and global\nlegitimacy: the state-centered approach and the people-centered\napproach. The former takes appropriate relations among states as\nbasic. As Charles Beitz characterizes this approach:\n\u201cinternational society is understood as domestic society writ\nlarge, with states playing the roles occupied by persons in domestic\nsociety. States, not persons, are the subjects of international\nmorality, and the rules that regulate their behavior are supposed to\npreserve a peaceful order of sovereign states\u201d (1979b: 408; see\nalso Beitz 1998). Locke, Bentham, and Mill, among others, approached\nthe issue of international legitimacy in this way. Among contemporary\nthinkers, Michael Walzer (1977, 1980) defends a state-based\u2014or\nas he calls it\u2014community-based approach. The most important\ncriterion of international legitimacy that he proposes is the\ncriterion of non-interference. (For discussions of Walzer\u2019s\nproposal, see Beitz 1979a, b). Others have put forward conceptions\nbased on state consent. Rawls advocates a conception based on the\nconsent of \u201cwell-ordered\u201d (either \u201cliberal\u201d or\n\u201cdecent\u201d) peoples (Rawls 1999; for critical discussions,\nsee e.g., Buchanan 2000; Wenar 2002; Cavallero 2003).\n\nThe second approach takes features of individuals\u2014their\ninterests or their rights\u2014as basic for legitimacy. At present,\nthe most comprehensive contemporary philosophical treatment of\ninternational legitimacy of this kind is probably Allen\nBuchanan\u2019s Justice, Legitimacy, and Self-Determination\n(2003). As mentioned above (section 2.2.), Buchanan advocates a\nmoralized conception of legitimacy, according to which entities are\nlegitimate if they are morally justified to wield political power.\nSpecifically, political legitimacy requires that a minimal standard of\njustice is met.\n\nOn the basis of this moralized conception of legitimacy, Buchanan\nargues against the state-based conception and against state consent\ntheories of legitimacy in particular. State consent, Buchanan claims,\nis neither necessary nor sufficient for legitimacy. It is not\nsufficient because it is well-known that states tend to be the worst\nperpetrators in matters of human rights and there is thus need for an\nindependent international standard of minimal justice to obtain\nlegitimacy. It is not necessary, because international law recognizes\nmany obligations as binding even without the consent of acting\ngovernments. As long as these obligations are compatible with the\nminimal standard of justice, they are legitimate even if they have\narisen without state consent.\n\nBuchanan also rejects the idea that the source of a legitimacy deficit\nat the international level is the inequality among states. He does not\nbelieve that states need to have equal weight in international\ninstitutions. What he regards as the main problem of legitimacy at the\ninternational level is, instead, that \u201ca technocratic elite,\nlacking in democratic accountability to individuals and nonstate\ngroups, is playing an increasingly powerful role in a system of\nregional and global governance\u201d (2003: 289). The more efficient\nremedy for this problem, he argues, is protecting basic human rights\nand improving democratic accountability.\n\nBuchanan uses his conception of legitimacy to answer the question when\na political entity\u2014as formed, for example, by secession or by\nunion\u2014should be recognized as legitimate. He lists three\ncriteria (Buchanan 2003: 266ff). The first is a \u201cminimal\ninternal justice requirement\u201d. It specifies how political\nentities should treat those upon whom it wields political power.\nSpecifically, it requires that basic human rights are protected. This\nrequirement includes a demand for minimal democracy. But not all\npolitical entities that satisfy this requirement deserve to be\nrecognized as legitimate. They also need to be formed in the right\nway. The second criterion is thus a criterion of procedural justice\nand requires that a political entity has not come about through\nusurpation (\u201cnonusurpation requirement\u201d). Finally, there\nis a \u201cminimal external justice requirement\u201d. It contains\nconditions about how political entities should interact with one\nanother.\n\nSofia N\u00e4sstr\u00f6m (2007) uses the people-centered approach to\npush against the tendency to associate state legitimacy with the\nlegitimacy of governments. The more fundamental question, she argues,\nis what makes the constitution of a people legitimate. And it would be\na mistake to think that the constitution of a people is a historical\nissue or an empirical given. What makes the constitution of a people\nlegitimate is a normative question in its own right that must be asked\nbefore we can ask about the legitimacy of the government of a\npeople.\n\nThe question N\u00e4sstr\u00f6m articulates, which is also discussed\nin the literature on the constitution of the demos (Goodin 2007), is\nimportant for the debate on the ethics of immigration. What is the\nscope for legitimate border controls? Do states have a unilateral\nright to control their borders or do potential immigrants have a right\nto participate in the determination of immigration policies? Abizadeh\n(2008) has argued, on the basis of the claim that the constitution of\nthe demos is not a historical given, that a commitment to a democratic\ntheory of domestic political legitimacy implies that one ought to\nreject the unilateral domestic right to control and close the\nstate\u2019s boundaries. His key claim is that state borders are\ncoercive to potential immigrants. In light of this, and because, in a\ndemocracy, the exercise of coercive political power requires some form\nof democratic justification, he concludes that both citizens and\nforeigners should have say in the determination of border policies.\n(See Miller 2008 for a critical discussion of this argument.)\n\nConceptions of global legitimacy broaden the scope of legitimate\nauthority to global governance institutions. One of the precursors of\nglobal legitimacy is Kant. Kant is often read as advocating a\nconception of international legitimacy based on a loose \u201cleague\nof nations\u201d\u2014especially in Perpetual Peace. But\nSharon Byrd and Joachim Hruschka (2008) argue that Kant, especially in\nThe Doctrine of Right, can also be read as favoring, a\n\u201cstate of nation states\u201d as the right approach to global\nlegitimacy. This conception, while stopping short of requiring a\nsingle world state, confers more coercive political power to the\nglobal level than the league of nations, which essentially leaves\nuntouched the sovereignty of nation states.\n\nThe philosophical literature on global legitimacy is very much work in\nprogress. But most proposals favor a multilevel system of governance\nin which global legitimacy is to be achieved through an appropriate\ndivision of labor between nation states and issue-specific global\ngovernance institutions (e.g., Caney 2006; Valentini 2012).\n\nAny successful theory of global legitimacy has to cover the following\nthree issues. First, what are global governance institutions and in\nwhat ways can and should they be thought of as taking over roles from\nstates or their governments? This is a question about the subject of\nglobal legitimacy (Hurrell and MacDonald 2012). Second, what is the\nlegitimacy problem that such governance institutions face? And, third,\nhow can they solve this problem of legitimacy and what are legitimacy\ncriteria that apply to them? How, if at all, do these criteria differ\nfrom those that apply at the level of nation states?\n\nIn response to the first question, Buchanan and Keohane (2006) argue\nthat global governance institutions such as the WTO or the IMF\n\u201care like governments in that they issue rules and publicly\nattach significant consequences to compliance or failure to comply\nwith them\u2014and claim authority to do so\u201d (Buchanan and\nKeohane 2006: 406). These institutions are set up to handle certain\nissues in similar fashion as national political agencies would. Just\nlike national political institutions, they are coordination devices.\nOnly they are created to solve problems that arise at the global\nlevel.\n\nJoshua Cohen and Charles Sabel (2005) have a slightly broader account\nof global governance institutions\u2014one that is not limited to\nthem being coordination devices, but that emphasizes coercion instead.\nAccording to Cohen and Sabel 2005: 765), \u201c[t]o a substantial and\ngrowing extent \u2026 rulemaking directly affecting the freedom of\naction of individuals, firms, and nation states (and the making of\nrules to regulate this rulemaking) is taking place \u2026 in global\nsettings created by the world\u2019s nations but no longer under\ntheir effective control.\u201d In their answer to the second\nquestion, they relate the legitimacy problem of global governance\ninstitutions to the absence of political authority, understood as\nlegitimate exercises of coercive political power, at the global level.\nTo overcome this problem, they argue, new modes of governance must be\ncreated, with their own structures of accountability. These structures\nare necessary to properly deal with the coercive power that these\ninstitutions exercise.\n\nBuchanan and Keohane agree that the attempt to rule without legitimacy\nis an unjustified exercise of power. They also argue that the attempt\nto rule without legitimacy raises not only a normative problem, but\nhas direct practical consequences, as institutions that appear\nunjustified will not be effective. The problem of legitimacy that\nglobal governance institutions face is that even when there is\nwidespread agreement that global institutions that can take on the\nrole of co-ordination devices are necessary, there will be widespread\ndisagreement about which particular institutions are necessary and\nwhat rules they should issue (Buchanan and Keohane 2006: 408ff).\n\nIn answer to the third question, Buchanan and Keohane (2006) propose a\nmoralized conception of legitimacy: legitimacy \u201cis the right to\nrule, understood to mean both that institutional agents are morally\njustified in making rules and attempting to secure compliance with\nthem and that people subject to those rules have moral,\ncontent-independent reasons to follow them and/or to not interfere\nwith others\u2019 compliance with them\u201d (2006: 411).\nSubstantively, they propose that an institution is morally justified\nin this way if it does not contribute to grave injustices\n(\u201cminimal moral acceptability\u201d), if there is no obvious\nalternative that would perform better (\u201ccomparative\nbenefit\u201d), and if it respects its own guidelines and procedures\n(\u201cinstitutional integrity\u201d) (Buchanan and Keohane 2006:\n419ff).\n\nAn important question for political cosmopolitanism is to what extent\ninternational and global legitimacy require democracy\u2014either at\nthe level of national states and governments or at the level of global\ngovernance institutions. Many writers on the subject have tended to\ntake a cautiously positive stance on this issue (e.g., Beitz 1979b,\n1998; Held 1995, 2002; Buchanan 2003; Buchanan and Keohane 2006). An\nexception is Rawls in The Law of Peoples, however,\nwho advocates a conception of international legitimacy that demands\nthat peoples and their states are well-ordered, but does not associate\nwell-orderedness with democracy.\n\nThere are two worries that tend to underlie the cautious attitude. One\nis feasibility: it is often argued that democracy at the international\nlevel, let alone at the level of global governance institutions, is\nutopian and cannot be realized. The second worry is of a moral nature:\ndemocracy should not be imposed on people and peoples who endorse a\ndifferent set of values (see Valentini 2014 for a discussion).\n\nIn response to the second worry, Christiano (2015) argues that a human\nright to democracy is compatible with a right to self-determination\nand that, properly understood, the right to self-determination\npresupposes the human right to democracy. Christiano\u2019s work\noffers the most comprehensive defense of a human right to democracy at\nthe domestic level (Christiano 2011; 2015). Christiano\u2019s\ninstrumental argument aims to show that democracies offer better\nprotection of a range of human rights than non-democracies. His\nintrinsic argument for a human right to democracy builds on an\nargument discussed earlier (section 4.2), namely that democracies are\nuniquely able to realize the value of publicly treating people as\nequals.\n\nCohen and Sabel (2005) seek to rescue an ideal of global democracy\nfrom more skeptical tendencies in the literature. They respond to\nthese considerations by advocating a notion of global democracy that\nemphasizes the deliberative aspect. Granting to skeptics that\ndemocratic decision-making mechanisms might be problematic for both\nfeasibility reasons and moral reasons, they argue that some form of\ndeliberation is primarily what is needed to address the legitimacy\ndeficit that global governance institutions face (see also Appiah\n2007; List and Koenig-Archibugi 2010).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Abizadeh, Arash, 2008. \u201cDemocratic Theory and Border\nCoercion No Right to Unilaterally Control Your Own Borders,\u201d\n<em>Political Theory</em>, 36(1): 37\u201365.", "Anscombe, G.E.M., 1981. \u201cOne the Source of Authority of the\nState,\u201d <em>Ethics, Religion, and Politics</em> (Collected\nPhilosophical Papers: Volume 3), Oxford: Blackwell, pp.\n130\u2013155.", "Appiah, Anthony, 2007. <em>Cosmopolitanism</em>, London:\nPenguin.", "Applbaum, Arthur, 2019. <em>Legitimacy: The Right to Rule in a\nWanton World</em>, Cambridge: Harvard University Press.", "Arendt, Hannah, 1992. <em>Lectures on Kant\u2019s Political\nPhilosophy</em>, Chicago: University of Chicago Press.", "Arneson, Richard, 2003. \u201cDefending the Purely Instrumental\nAccount of Democratic Legitimacy,\u201d <em>Journal of Political\nPhilosophy</em>, 11(1): 122\u2013132.", "Arrow, Kenneth, 1963. <em>Social Choice and Individual\nValues</em>, New Haven: Yale University Press.", "Aytac, Ugur, 2022. \u201cGlobal Political Legitimacy and the\nStructural Power of Capital,\u201d <em>Journal of Social\nPhilosophy</em>, first online 11 March 2022. doi:10.1111/josp.12464", "Baderin, Alice, 2014. \u201cTwo Forms of Realism in Political\nTheory,\u201d <em>European Journal of Political Theory</em>, 13(2):\n132\u2013153.", "Barnard, Frederick M., 2001. <em>Democratic Legitimacy: Plural\nValues and Political Power</em>, Montreal: McGill-Queen\u2019s\nUniversity Press.", "Beetham, David, 1991. <em>The Legitimation of Power</em>,\nBasingstoke: Palgrave.", "Beitz, Charles, 1979a. <em>Political Theory and International\nRelations</em>, Princeton: Princeton University Press.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1979b. \u201cBounded Morality: Justice and\nthe State in World Politics,\u201d <em>International\nOrganization</em>, 33: 405\u2013424.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1998. \u201cInternational Relations,\nPhilosophy of,\u201d in Edward Craig (ed.), <em>Routledge\nEncyclopedia of Philosophy</em>, London: Routledge,\npp.455\u2013456.", "Benhabib, Seyla, 1994. \u201cDeliberative Rationality and Models\nof Democratic Legitimacy,\u201d <em>Constellations</em>, 1(1):\n25\u201353.", "Bentham, Jeremy, 1987 [1843]. \u201cAnarchical Fallacies,\u201d\nin Waldron, Jeremy (ed.), <em>Nonsense upon Stilts</em>, London:\nTaylor and Francis, pp. 46\u201369.", "Binmore, Ken, 2000. \u201cA Utilitarian Theory of\nLegitimacy,\u201d in <em>Economics, Values, and Organization</em>,\nBen-Ner, Avner and Louis G.
