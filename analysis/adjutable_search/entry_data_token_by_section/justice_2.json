    "main_text": "Justice: Mapping the Concept || Justice, Charity and Enforceable Obligation\n1.2 Justice, Charity and Enforceable Obligation\n\nSecond, Justinian\u2019s definition underlines that just treatment is\nsomething due to each person, in other words that justice is\na matter of claims that can be rightfully made against the agent\ndispensing justice, whether a person or an institution. Here there is\na contrast with other virtues: we demand justice, but we beg for\ncharity or forgiveness. This also means that justice is a matter of\nobligation for the agent dispensing it, and that the agent wrongs the\nrecipient if the latter is denied what is due to her. It is a\ncharacteristic mark of justice that the obligations it creates should\nbe enforceable: we can be made to deliver what is due to\nothers as a matter of justice, either by the recipients themselves or\nby third parties. However it overstates the position to make the\nenforceability of its requirements a defining feature of justice (see\nBuchanan 1987). On the one hand, there are some claims of justice that\nseem not to be enforceable (by anyone). When we dispense gifts to our\nchildren or our friends, we ought to treat each recipient fairly, but\nneither the beneficiaries themselves nor anyone else can rightfully\nforce the giver to do so. On the other hand, in cases of extreme\nemergency, it may sometimes be justifiable to force people to do more\nthan justice requires them to do \u2013 there may exist enforceable\nduties of humanity. But these are rare exceptions. The obligatory\nnature of justice generally goes hand-in-hand with enforceability.\n",
