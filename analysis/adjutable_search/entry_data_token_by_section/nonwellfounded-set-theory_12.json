    "main_text": "Using AFA || Collection circularity in ZFA\n3.4 Collection circularity in ZFA\n\n The fact that AFA allows us to solve various kinds of\nsystems of set equations is only the beginning.  When we discussed\ninfinite trees in\n Section 1.2,\n we noted that the collection Tr of infinite trees\nshould satisfy (7), repeated below: \n\nTr\u00a0\u00a0 =\u00a0\u00a0\n {x, y} \u222a ({\u2022} \u00d7 Tr) \u222a\n  ({*} \u00d7 Tr \u00d7 Tr).\n \n\nA similar equation should hold of streams from \nSection 1.1:\n\n\nN\u221e\u00a0\u00a0 =\u00a0\u00a0  N \u00d7\nN\u221e .\n \n\nFor that matter,  the universe V\nof sets should satisfy\n \n\nV\u00a0\u00a0 =\u00a0\u00a0\u2118V\n\n\nAssuming the Power Set Axiom and the formulation of \n\u2118 as an operator\non classes, the universe \nV does satisfy this equation.\n\n\nWe are free to step back and think of these as equations which\nwe hope to solve.   For example, we could take the set N as known,\nregard N\u221e as a variable, and then consider an equation like\nX = N\u00d7X.    \nHowever, the  none of these is the kind of equation that we could hope to\nsolve in a perfectly general way using AFA: the right-hand sides are \nnot given in terms of sets of objects on the left.\nSolving more complicated systems takes special additional  work.\nHere is what is known on this.\n\n\nFirst, under FA,  \nthe first two of our three equations each have a unique\nsolution: the empty set.   Under AFA, they have many solutions.\nFor example, for the stream equation, the set of streams corresponding to\nfunctions which are eventually  0 is a solution.   \nHowever, the largest solutions are of special interest.   \nFor these, one can prove that the largest solutions are in one-to-one correspondence\nwith what we have called the unraveled forms.   And for other reasons which we\nshall see, there is a good reason to accept the claim that the largest solutions\nare good mathematical models of the intuitive concepts. \n\n\nUnder AFA, things are different.   Here is the general picture:\nAn operator on sets F is  monotone if whenever\na \u2286 b,\nthen also Fa \u2286 Fb.\n    This is a very common feature\nfor operators on sets.   The polynomial operators on sets\nare the smallest collection containing the constant operators, \nand closed under cartesian product, disjoint union, and functions from\na fixed set.    For example, if A and B are fixed sets, then \nFs  = (A \u00d7 s)  +\n B(s + A) is a polynomial operator on sets.\nIf one also allows the power set operator to occur, then we\nget the power polynomial operators.   Every power polynomial operator\nis\nmonotone.    And now, we have the following results due to  Aczel:\n\n\n\nProposition. Then \n every monotone operator  F on\nsets has a least fixed point F*   and a\n greatest fixed point  F*.    In particular, \n every polynomial operator on classes has least \n and greatest fixed points.      On classes, the same is true for\n the  larger collection of power polynomial operators.\n \n\n\nAssuming FA, the fixed points are unique; frequently they are the \nempty set.   \nWith AFA, the greatest fixed points usually have non-wellfounded \nmembers.    We shall study this in more detail when we turn to coalgebra.\nFor now,  we return to the last of the example equations\nat the top of this section, \nV\u00a0\u00a0 =\u00a0\u00a0\u2118V.\n This equation has no solutions\nin sets due to \nCantor\u2019s Theorem.\nHowever, in terms of classes, this equation does have solutions, as we\nknow.   The universal class  V\n is a solution, as we have seen.   \nAnd the class WF of well-founded sets is a solution.   This is the \nsmallest solution \u2118*, and \n V  is the largest.    Under FA, \n\u2118*\n = V\n   = \u2118*.   Under AFA, \n \u2118*\n  and \u2118* are\ndifferent: \n\u2118*  = WF, and \n\u2118* =  V\n and thus contains \nsets such as  \u03a9= {\u03a9}.\n\n4. Comparing Foundation and Anti-Foundation\n\nThe purpose of this section is to compare FA and AFA in a \ntechnical way, using ideas from category theory.    That is, the \nlanguage of category theory and especially its \nbuilt-in feature of duality are used to say something insightful\nabout the relation between FA and AFA.    Further, the dual\nstatements about the axioms\n suggest a much more systematic and thoroughgoing \nduality about a host of other concepts.    This deeper point is\nnot a strictly mathematical result but rather more of a research program,\nand so the final subsection here will detail some of what is known\nabout it.\n\n\nAs we said, our work here begins to use category theory.\nWe realize that not all readers will be familiar with that subject\nat all.    \nSo we shall \ntry to make this section as accessible as possible.\nIn particular, we\u2019ll \nonly present those notions from category theory that we actually\nneed in our work of this section.      We also illustrate all of the \ndefinitions on a few categories which will be of interest.  And as we go\non in future sections, we\u2019ll develop only the background that we \nneed.[11]\n\n\nOur use of category theory is mainly for the terminology and intuition.   \nWe know that there are philosophical issues connected with the use\nof category theory as a foundation for mathematics.     This entry does not\ndeal  with any of these issues in a head-on way.\n\n\nInitial and final objects.\n\n\nWe need a definition from category theory.\nFix a category C.\nAn object x  is initial if for every object y\nthere is exactly one morphism \nf\u2009:\u2009x \u2192 y \nDually, an object x  is final if for every object y\nthere is exactly one morphism\nf\u2009:\u2009y \u2192 x.\n\n\nIn  Set, the empty set is an initial object; for every set y,\nthe empty function is the only function from  \u2205 to y.\nIn addition, the empty set is the only initial object.\n\n\nAs for final objects, every singleton {x} is a final object.\nFor every set y, the constant function with value x is the only\nfunction from y  to x.    And the singletons are the only final objects \nin the category.\n\n\nProposition\nLet C be a category, and  a\n and b\nbe initial objects.\nThen a and b are\nisomorphic objects: there are \nmorphisms\nf\u2009:\u2009a \u2192 b \nand \ng\u2009:\u2009b \u2192 a \nand  \n such that\n  g\u22c5f = ida\nand \n f\u22c5g = idb.\n\n\nProof\nBy initiality, we get (unique) morphisms f and g as in our statement.\nNote that\ng\u22c5f is a morphism from\na to itself.   And since \na is initial\nand ida\n is also such a morphism, we see that \n g\u22c5f \n   = ida.\nSimilarly for  b.\n\n",
