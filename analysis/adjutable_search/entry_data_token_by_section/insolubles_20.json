    "main_text": "The Second Quarter of the Fourteenth Century || Albert of Saxony\n3.9 Albert of Saxony\n\nMuch closer to Bradwardine\u2019s theory than to Buridan\u2019s is\nthat of another Paris logician, Albert of Saxony, who arrived in Paris\nsometime before 1351 and taught there until around 1362. His view of\nthe insolubles is similar to Buridan\u2019s early view, arguing in a\nsimilar way that every proposition signifies its own truth. But there\nis reason to doubt whether Albert was a student or even follower of\nBuridan, for Buridan belonged to the Picardian Nation at the\nUniversity, whereas Albert was in the English (or by then\n\u201cAnglo-German\u201d) Nation, and in general his outlook follows\nthe English logical tradition from earlier in the century. What is\nperhaps most impressive, and enjoyable, about Albert\u2019s treatise\non Insolubles (Albert of Saxony, [AS-I]), the first part of\nthe sixth treatise of his Perutilis Logica (A Really\nUseful Logic), is the extensive list of insolubles treated, and\ntheir variety. For example, we find there a paradox much discussed in\nthe recent literature on paradoxes under the title\n\u2018V-Curry\u2019, closely related to\n Curry\u2019s paradox.\n In fact, in its contemporary form it appears in Dumbleton\u2019s\ndiscussion of the insolubles (see above,\n Section 3.6)\n and in Heytesbury\u2019s Sophismata Asinina ([H-SA}:\nsophism 18, p. 413): consider the inference with sole premise\n\u2018This inference is valid\u2019 and conclusion \u2018A man is\nan ass\u2019. Albert contraposes it, inferring \u2018This inference\nis invalid\u2019 from the premise \u2018God exists\u2019. The text\ntranslated in \u201cInsolubles\u201d ([AS-I]: XIV, p. 368) follows\nthe Venice 1522 edition. As given in [AS-L] (p. 1158), following the\nmanuscripts, the text should read:\n\n\nLet this inference be A, its premise [\u2018God exists\u2019]\nB, and its conclusion [\u2018This inference is invalid\u2019]\nC, and let \u2018this\u2019 indicate the inference itself.\nThen I put forward inference A, and I ask whether inference\nA is valid or not.\n\n[i] If one says that it is valid, then, since its premise is true, it\nfollows that its conclusion is true. And if its conclusion is true,\nthen things are as its conclusion signifies. But the conclusion\nsignifies that inference A is not valid. Therefore, inference\nA is not valid.\n\n[ii] But if one says that inference A is not valid\u2014on the\ncontrary: If inference A is not valid, it is possible that\nB be true while C is false. But that is false, which I\nprove as follows. For if A is not valid, then C is true,\nand so A is valid, since B is not true unless C\nis true. So if A is not valid, A is valid. The premise\n[\u2018If A is not valid then C is true\u2019] is\nclear, for if A is not valid, things are as C signifies,\nbecause C signifies that A is not valid; and,\nconsequently, C is true. The first inference is evident, for in\norder that A be valid it is enough that B cannot be true\nwithout C, if it is formulated. The last inference holds\n\u201cfrom the first to the last\u201d.\n\n\nIn a nutshell, Albert\u2019s argument in [ii] is that if A is\ninvalid, it must be possible for B to be true and C\nfalse. But if A is invalid, C is true. So it is\nimpossible for B to be true and C false. So even if\nA is invalid, it is valid, and so A is valid. But by\n[i], if A is valid it is invalid. So it is\nboth\u2014paradox.\n\nDumbleton\u2019s response to the paradox was to deny that the premise\n(of his version, \u2018This inference is valid\u2019) constitutes a\nproposition, given the regressive reference of its subject\n(\u2018this inference\u2019\u2014which inference?\u2014\u2018this\ninference\u2019, \u2026; see\n 3.6 John Dumbleton).\n Albert\u2019s response, however, in line with his general approach\nto the insolubles, is to agree that his inverted inference is indeed\ninvalid, but to deny that it follows that C (\u2018This\ninference is invalid\u2019) is true, for C signifies more than\njust that A is invalid. Thus the premise (\u2018God\nexists\u2019) can be true without the conclusion being true, and so\nthe inference really is invalid.\n",
