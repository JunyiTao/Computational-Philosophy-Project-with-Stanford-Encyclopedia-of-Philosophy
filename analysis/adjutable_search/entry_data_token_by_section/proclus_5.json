    "main_text": "Philosophical views || Metaphysics and Theology\n3.1 Metaphysics and Theology\n\n\nIn late antiquity, Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics was considered to\nbe a theological work, because Aristotle investigates in this treatise\nthe first principles of all being:\n\n\nThis discipline may be called theology, because the\nprinciples of beings and the first and most perfect causes of things\nare what is most of all divine. (Asclepius, In Metaph.\n4.1\u20133)\nIndeed, there is precedent for this in Aristotle himself, for\nin Metaphysics VI, 1, 1026a15ff, he classifies \u201cfirst\nphilosophy,\u201d or metaphysics, as theology.\n\n\nProclus himself often uses the term \u2018theology\u2019 in this\nmetaphysical sense for the study of the first (\u2018divine\u2019)\nprinciples of all things. His Elements of Theology can in\nfact be considered an introduction to his metaphysics.  The work is a\nconcatenated demonstration of 217 propositions, which may be divided\ninto two halves: the first 112 propositions establish the One, unity\nwithout any multiplicity, as the ultimate cause of reality and lay\ndown basic metaphysical concepts/structures such as causality,\nparticipation, the relation of wholes to parts, infinity, and\neternity. The second half deals with the three kinds of true causes\nwithin reality recognized by Proclus: gods (which he calls henads or\n\u201cunities,\u201d see below), intellects, and souls.  This\nelaborate metaphysical framework makes it possible for Proclus to\ndevelop a scientific theology, i.e., a demonstration of the procession\nand properties of the different classes of gods. In what follows we\nwill only discuss some characteristic features of Proclus\u2019 metaphysics\n(see further Steel 2011).\n\n\nOn the whole, Proclus\u2019 doctrine of first principles is a further\ndevelopment of Plotinus\u2019 innovative interpretation of Platonic\nphilosophy. With Plotinus, Proclus recognizes three fundamental levels\nof reality called \u2018hypostases\u2019 (or self-subsistent\nentities): One, Intellect, and Soul. However, following a concern of\nhis predecessor Iamblichus for greater precision in the relationship\nand distinction between the One and Intellect, Proclus distinguishes\nbetween the intelligible Being (to no\u00eaton\u2014what is\nthe object of intellectual intuition) and the intellective (to\nnoeron\u2014what is intelligizing), and introduces between both,\nas an intermediary level, the\nno\u00eaton-noeron (what is being intelligized and\nintelligizing). These three ontological levels thus correspond to the\ntriad of Being, Life, and Intellect, which already play an important\nrole in Plotinus\u2019 and Porphyry\u2019s speculations about the procession or\n\u2018emanation\u2019 of the intelligible world from the One,\nwithout, however, being hypostasized. Since Zeller (influenced by\nHegel) the application of the triadic structure to reality has been\nseen as the characteristic feature of Proclus\u2019 system, but see Dodds\n19632, pp. xxii and 220, on possible sources of the doctrine.\n\n\nAlthough the distinction of aspects of reality as distinct\nhypostases and the multiplication of triads might suggest a\nloss of Plotinus\u2019 intuition of the unity of reality, it is\nimportant to stress that each part of the triad of Being, Life and\nIntellect, mirrors within itself their triadic relationship.  This\nredoubled triadic structure must be understood as expressing an\nintrinsic and essential relation between successive levels of\nbeing. The intimate relation between Being, Life, and Intellect is the\norigin of the basic structure uniting all causes to their effects,\nnamely the relation of immanence, procession and reversion\n(mon\u00ea-prohodos-epistroph\u00ea, see Elem.\nTheol. \u00a7 35). This triad has been called the \u201ctriad of\ntriads,\u201d the underlying principle of all triadic structures:\n\nEvery effect remains in its cause, proceeds from it, and reverts upon\nit. For if it should remain without procession or reversion, it would\nbe without distinction from, and therefore identical with, its cause,\nsince distinction implies procession. And if it should proceed without\nreversion or immanence [sc. in the cause], it would be without\nconjunction or sympathy with its cause, since it would have no\ncommunication with it. And if it should revert without immanence\n[sc. in the cause] or procession, how can that which has not received\nits being from the higher revert existentially upon a principle thus\nalien? [Elem. Theol. \u00a7 35, transl.  E.R. Dodds]\n\n\nAnother fundamental triad is the triad\nUnparticipated-Participated-Participating\n(amethekton-metechomenon-metechon). Plato\u2019s theory of\nparticipation, which explains the relation between the intelligible\nworld and the sensible reality it grounds, raised many problems,\nseveral of which Plato himself brings up in the first part of\nhis Parmenides. Most pressing was the puzzle: How can a Form\nbe at the same time one and the same and exist as a whole in many\nparticipants? (see Plato, Parmenides 131a-b). The basic idea\nof the triad of participation, which can also be seen as responding to\nAristotle\u2019s criticism of participation, is to maintain the\ntranscendence, and hence, the unity of the Form, while allowing for\nits presence in the participants.  Thanks to the existence of an\n\u2018unparticipated\u2019 principle, that is, one that is not such\nas to be participated in by anything, to which the\n\u2018participated\u2019 entities, the ones that are participated in\nby something, are connected by means of \u201cthe triad of\ntriads\u201d (Elem. Theol. \u00a7 23), the universal nature\nof the Form can be safeguarded.\n\n\nProclus, however, also applies this principle to explain the most\ndifficult problem facing Neoplatonic metaphysics, namely, how to\nunderstand the procession of the manifold from the One. How can the\nOne be wholly without multiplicity, when it must somehow be the cause\nof any and all multiplicity? The One remains in itself absolutely\nunparticipated; the many different beings proceeding from it\nparticipate in a series of participated henads or unities (gods).\nAccording to some scholars it was Iamblichus who introduced this\ninnovative doctrine, others attribute it to Proclus\u2019 teacher\nSyrianus. Even if the doctrine does not originate as such from\nIamblichus himself, the existence of the divine henads somehow follows\nfrom his law of mean terms. This law states that \u201cevery\nproducing cause brings into existence things like to itself before the\nunlike.\u201c (Elem. Theol. \u00a7 28).  Thus there are no leaps in\nthe chain of being, but everything is linked together by similar\nterms. The henads fulfill this function, for as participated unities\nthey bridge the gap between the transcendent One and everything that\ncomes after it. The doctrine of the henads can thus be seen as a way\nof integrating the traditional gods of Greek polytheistic religion\ninto the Neoplatonic metaphysics of the One.\n",
