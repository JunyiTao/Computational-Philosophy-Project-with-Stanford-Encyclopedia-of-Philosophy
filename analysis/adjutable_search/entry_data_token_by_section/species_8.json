    "main_text": "Species Pluralism || Older Responses to Pluralism\n3.2 Older Responses to Pluralism\n\nNot everyone is willing to accept species pluralism. Monists have\nlaunched a number of objections to species pluralism. (for example,\nSober 1984, Ghiselin 1987, Hull 1987, de Queiroz 1999, Mayden 2002,\nBrigandt 2003, Pigliucci 2003, Wilkins 2003, and Richards 2010) One\nobjection centers on the type of lineage that should be accepted as\nspecies. Some monists allow the existence of different types of base\nlineages but contend that only one type of lineage should be called\n\u2018species\u2019 (Ghiselin 1987). For instance, supporters of the\nBiological Species Concept believe that lineages of interbreeding\nsexual organisms are much more important in the evolution of life on\nthis planet (Eldredge 1985, Lee 2003, Coyne and Orr 2004). They argue\nthat only the Biological Species Concept, or some interbreeding\nconcept, should be accepted.\n\nHowever, adopting only an interbreeding approach to species has its\ncosts: it would exclude all asexual organisms from forming species.\nInterbreeding requires the genetic contributions of two sexual\norganisms. Asexual organisms reproduce by themselves, either through\ncloning, vegetative means, or self fertilization. Some reptiles and\namphibians reproduce asexually. Many insects reproduce asexually. And\nasexuality is rampant in plants, fungi and bacteria. In fact, asexual\nreproduction is the prominent form of reproduction on Earth (Hull\n1988, Templeton 1989). If one adopts an interbreeding approach to\nspecies, then most organisms do not form species. This seems a high\nprice to pay for species monism.\n\nAnother objection to species pluralism is that pluralism is an overly\nliberal position (Sober 1984, Ghiselin 1987, and Hull 1987).\nPluralists allow a number of legitimate species concepts, but how do\npluralists determine which concepts should be accepted as legitimate?\nShould any species concept proposed by a biologist be accepted? What\nabout those concepts proposed by non biologists? Without criteria for\ndetermining the legitimacy of a proposed species concept, species\npluralism boils down to a position of anything goes.\n\nSpecies pluralists respond to this objection by suggesting criteria\nfor judging the legitimacy of a proposed species concept (Dupr\u00e9\n1993, Ereshefsky 2001). Such criteria can be used to determine which\nspecies concepts should be accepted into the plurality of legitimate\nspecies concepts. Candidate criteria are the epistemic virtues that\nscientists typically use for determining the scientific worthiness of\na theory. For example, in judging a species concept, one might ask if\nthe theoretical assumptions of a concept are empirically testable. The\nBiological Species Concept relies on the assumption that interbreeding\ncauses the existence of stable lineages. It also assumes that\norganisms that cannot interbreed do not form stable lineages. Whether\ninterbreeding and only interbreeding causes the existence of stable\nlineages is empirically testable. So the Biological Species Concept\nhas the virtue of empirical sensitivity. Other criteria for judging\nspecies concepts include intertheoretic coherence and internal\nconsistency. Pluralists can provide criteria for discerning which\nconcepts should be accepted as legitimate. Thus the \u2018anything\ngoes\u2019 objection can be answered.\n\nAnother response to species pluralism is de Queiroz\u2019s (1999,\n2005, 2007) General Lineage Concept. De Queiroz suggests that despite\ndifferences among various species concepts, all such concepts agree on\none thing: species are \u201cseparately evolving metapopulation\nlineages\u201d (2005, 1263). De Queiroz writes that this conception\nof species is the \u201csingle, more general, concept of\nspecies\u201d that reconciles all other species concepts (2007, 880).\nWhat is the relationship between the General Lineage Concept and those\nconcepts? De Queiroz suggests that the General Lineage Concept\nprovides the necessary criterion for being a species. The properties\nthat other species concepts disagree over, for example, a\nlineage\u2019s occupying a unique niche, being monophyletic, or being\nreproductively isolated, are contingent properties of species. They\nare \u201csecondary\u201d properties of species (de Queiroz 2005,\n1264). All species taxa must be metapopulation lineages, but they can\nvary in their secondary properties. De Queiroz contrasts the necessary\nproperty of species from their secondary properties in another way.\nWhereas the necessary property cited by the General Species Concept\ncaptures the fundamental nature of species, the secondary properties\nof species are merely \u201coperational criteria\u201d (2007, 882)\nfor \u201cinferring the boundaries and numbers of species\u201d\n(2005, 264). According to de Queiroz, disagreements among other\nspecies concepts merely concern operational and evidential issues.\nProponents of other species concepts are confusing\n\u201cmethodological\u201d disagreements with\n\u201cconceptual\u201d ones (de Queiroz 2005, 1267).\n\nOne concern one might have about de Queiroz\u2019s attempt to unify\nthe species category is that proponents of other species concepts\nwould disagree with de Queiroz\u2019s assertion that their\ndisagreements are merely over evidence for the numbers and boundaries\nof species. Proponents of the interbreeding, ecological and\nphylogenetic approaches believe that they are identifying different\ntypes of lineages (interbreeding lineages, ecological lineages,\nphylogenetic lineages), not merely disagreeing over evidence for the\nsame type of lineage. For example, when supporters of the\ninterbreeding approach say that asexual organisms do not form species\nthey are making a conceptual or ontological claim, not an operational\nclaim. De Queiroz\u2019s unified approach seems to mischaracterize\ndisagreements among proponents of other species concepts.\n\nAnother potential problem is how the General Lineage Concept\ndistinguishes species from higher taxa. According to de Queiroz,\nspecies are single lineages whereas higher taxa are clades of multiple\nlineages. What, then, distinguishes a single lineage from a branch\nwith multiple lineages according to the General Lineage Concept? De\nQueiroz (2005, 1265) writes that the General Lineage Concept does not\nneed to cite the secondary properties mentioned in other species\nconcepts to answer this. However, de Queiroz offers no alternative\ncriteria for determining when a single lineage becomes a branch of\nmultiple lineages. Moreover, the secondary properties of other species\nconcepts are commonly used to make that determination. Therein lies a\npotential problem with the General Lineage Concept\u2019s attempt to\nunify the species category. According to the General Lineage Concept,\nspecies are lineages. But to determine what is a lineage we must turn\nto other species concepts, and in doing so the heterogeneity of the\nspecies category rears its head again. De Queiroz attempts to unify\nthe species category by asserting that all and only lineages are\nspecies. But that just masks the heterogeneity of the species category\nbecause what constitutes a lineage has multiple answers, and those\nanswers vary according to which species concept one adopts.\n",
