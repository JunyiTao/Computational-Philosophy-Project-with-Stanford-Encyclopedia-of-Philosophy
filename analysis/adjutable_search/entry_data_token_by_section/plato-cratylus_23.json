Coda: The \u201cPower\u201d of Names (435d\u2013440e)\n\nAs soon as Socrates has concluded his investigation of the correctness\nof names, he turns to a different (if closely related) topic and asks\nCratylus what the \u201cpower\u201d (dynamis) of names is.\nCratylus answers that names have the power to teach (435d). While this\nis reminiscent of Socrates\u2019 earlier contention that names are\ninstruments for teaching (388b\u2013c), it soon turns out that\nCratylus has something more radical in mind. What he wants to defend\nis the claim that analysing names is the only way of gaining knowledge\nabout their referents\u2019 being. For him, philosophical etymology\n(see\n section 6.1)\n and mimetological studies are thus not a, but the\npath to knowledge. Socrates objects by making an observation that is\nillustrated well by his earlier etymological and mimetological\ndiscussions: that examining names will at the very best lead one to\nthe opinions of the ancient lawgivers who have introduced the names,\nand that these opinions can be wrong (436a\u2013b). Cratylus has a\nresponse: He argues that the opinions of the ancient lawgivers are\ncoherently Heraclitean in character, and that this coherence\nguarantees their truth (436b\u2013c). Unimpressed, Socrates retorts\nthat coherence does not guarantee truth (436c\u2013d) and that there\nare also some cases in which the analysis of names suggests that the\nancient lawgivers held decidedly un-Heraclitean opinions\n(436d\u2013437d). He also points out that the knowledge that Cratylus\nascribes to the ancient lawgivers cannot\u2014on pain of\nregress\u2014have resulted from an examination of names\n(438a\u2013d).\n\nAll in all, Socrates presents a very compelling case against\nCratylus\u2019 conviction that one needs to analyse names in order to\nlearn anything about reality. But he also draws a positive conclusion\nfrom his reflections: It must be possible \u201cto learn about the\nbeings without names\u201d (438e). The purport of this conclusion is\nnot immediately clear. One might think that Socrates means to\nadvertise some sort of intuitive, non-linguistic understanding (see,\ne.g., Derbolav 1972: 201\u2013207; Silverman 2001: 25f.). But that\nseems implausible; for Socrates will soon go on to use names to gain\ninsight into the nature of reality. According to a more plausible\ninterpretation, Socrates wants to claim that one should examine things\ninstead of names, but not that one should refrain from using names\nwhen investigating (Sedley 2003: 162; Ademollo 2011: 445). He might\nalso have a special mode of inquiry in mind when he says that it must\nbe possible to learn without names: He might be thinking of a broadly\ntranscendental inquiry that aims at ascertaining how reality must be\norganized if language and knowledge are to be possible (Thomas\n2008).\n\nWhatever Socrates\u2019 exact theoretical point is when he suggests\nan \u201cinquiry without names\u201d\u2014he very soon starts his\nown investigation into the nature of reality, arguing that Heraclitus\ncannot be right when he claims that everything is in flux. His case\nagainst this claim is based on the presupposition that there are not\nonly beautiful or good things, but also the beautiful itself or the\ngood itself (439c\u2013d)\u2014Platonic forms, it would seem. As\nSocrates points out, four absurd consequences follow if one assumes\nthat even these entities are in constant flux:\n\nOne could not make true statements about them, because they would\nchange while one speaks (439d);\nthey would not be anything, because being something presupposes\nstaying in the same state for some time (439d\u2013e);\nthey would not be knowable, because they would change before one\ncould get to know them (439e\u2013440a); and\nthere would be no knowledge, because knowledge itself would be in\nconstant flux (440a\u2013b).\n\n\nThese arguments against Heraclitus\u2019 theory of flux are very\ncompressed and leave open many questions. Fittingly, Socrates admits\nthat he is not sure whether he has really established that Heraclitus\nis wrong in claiming that everything is in flux and declares that the\nissue should be investigated more thoroughly without relying on\nphilosophical etymology (440c\u2013d). Cratylus, on the other hand,\nis still convinced that Heraclitus is right (440d\u2013e).\nAccompanied by Hermogenes, he leaves for the countryside\u2014and\nends the dialogue that bears his name.\n",
