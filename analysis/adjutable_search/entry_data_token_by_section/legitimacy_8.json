    "main_text": "Sources of Political Legitimacy || Normative Facts and Epistemic Advantage\n3.3 Normative Facts and Epistemic Advantage\n\nThe theories of political legitimacy reviewed in the previous two\nsections take the citizens\u2019 will, whether expressed through\ntheir actual consent, supported by shared or converging reasons, or\nestablished through processes of political participation, as the\nground of political legitimacy. While such will-based conceptions have\ndominated the philosophical literature on political legitimacy, they\nare not the only conceptions on offer. There are two main\nalternatives, as well as hybrid conceptions (see Peter 2023). A first\nalternative are fact-based conceptions of political legitimacy,\naccording to which the legitimacy of political institutions and\ndecisions depends on whether they accord with normative facts.\nUtilitarian theories, which focus on the beneficial consequences of\npolitical institutions and the decisions made within them, are a good\nexample. According to belief-based conceptions, as articulated in\nepistocratic conceptions and in some epistemic theories of democracy,\nthe source of political legitimacy is some form of epistemic advantage\nthat supports the justification of political decisions. In this\nsection, we expand on the two main alternatives to will-based\nconceptions of political legitimacy.\n\nIn the utilitarian view, legitimate political authority should be\ngrounded on the principle of utility. The relevant normative facts are\nfacts concerning the maximization of happiness or utility. Christian\nThomasius, a student of Pufendorf and contemporary of Locke, may be\nseen as a precursor of the utilitarian approach to political\nlegitimacy, as he rejected voluntarism and endorsed the idea that\npolitical legitimacy depends on principles of rational prudence\ninstead (Schneewind 1998: 160; Barnard 2001: 66). Where Thomasius\ndiffers from the utilitarians, however, is in his attempt to identify\na distinctively political\u2014not moral or legal\u2014source of\nlegitimacy. He developed the idea of \u201cdecorum\u201d into a\ntheory of how people should relate to one another in the political\ncontext. Decorum is best described as a principle of \u201ccivic\nmutuality\u201d (Barnard 2001: 65): \u201cYou treat others as you\nwould expect them to treat you\u201d (Thomasius, Foundations of\nthe Law of Nature and of Nations, quoted by Barnard 2001: 65). By\nthus distinguishing legitimacy from legality and justice, Thomasius\nadopted an approach that was considerably ahead of his time.\n\nJeremy Bentham (in Anarchical Fallacies) rejects the\nHobbesian idea that political authority is created by a social\ncontract. According to Bentham, it is the state that creates the\npossibility of binding contracts. The problem of legitimacy that the\nstate faces is which of its laws are justified. Bentham proposes that\nlegitimacy depends on whether a law contributes to the happiness of\nthe citizens. (For a contemporary take on this utilitarian principle\nof legitimacy, see Binmore 2000.)\n\nA well-known problem with the view that Bentham articulates is that it\njustifies restrictions of rights that liberals find unacceptable. John\nStuart Mill\u2019s answer to this objection consists, on the one\nhand, in an argument for the compatibility between utilitarianism and\nthe protection of liberty rights and, on the other, in an\ninstrumentalist defense of democratic political authority based on the\nprinciple of utility. According to Mill, both individual freedom and\nthe right to participate in politics are necessary for the\nself-development of individuals (Mill On Liberty and\nConsiderations on Representative Government, see Brink 1992;\nTen 1998).\n\nWith regard to the defense of liberty rights, Mill argues that the\nrestriction of liberty is illegitimate unless it is permitted by the\nharm principle, that is, unless the actions suppressed by the\nrestriction harm others (On Liberty, chapter 1; for a\ncritical discussion of the harm principle as the basis of legitimacy,\nsee Wellman 1996; see also Turner 2014). Mill\u2019s view of the\ninstrumental value of (deliberative) democracy is expressed in the\nfollowing passage of the first chapter of On Liberty:\n\u201cDespotism is a legitimate mode of government in dealing with\nbarbarians, provided that the end be their improvement and the means\njustified by actually effecting that end. Liberty, as a principle, has\nno application to any state of things anterior to the time when\nmankind have become capable of being improved by free and equal\ndiscussion.\u201d Deliberation is important, according to Mill,\nbecause of his belief in the power of ideas\u2014in what Habermas\nwould later call the force of the better argument (Habermas 1990:\n158ff). Deliberation should keep partisan interests, which could\nthreaten legitimacy by undermining the general happiness, in check:\n\u201cThe representative system ought \u2026 not to allow any of\nthe various sectional interests to be so powerful as to be capable of\nprevailing against truth and justice and the other sectional interests\ncombined. There ought always to be such a balance preserved among\npersonal interests as may render any one of them dependent for its\nsuccesses, on carrying with it at least a large proportion of those\nwho act on higher motives, and more comprehensive and distant\nviews\u201d (Mill, Collected Works XIX: 447, cited by Ten\n1998: 379).\n\nMany are not convinced that such instrumentalist reasoning provides a\nsatisfactory account of political legitimacy. Rawls (1971:175ff) and\nJeremy Waldron (1987: 143ff) object that the utilitarian approach will\nultimately only convince those who stand to benefit from the felicific\ncalculus, and that it lacks an argument to convince those who stand to\nlose.\n\nCan fact-based conceptions of political legitimacy address this\nproblem? Fair play theories offer one solution to this problem (see\nKlosko 2004 and the entry on\n political obligation).\n Wellman\u2019s (1996) samaritan account of political legitimacy is\nalso an attempt to overcome this problem. In his account, a\nstate\u2019s legitimacy depends on it being justified to use coercion\nto enforce its laws. His suggestion is that the justification of the\nstate can be grounded in the samaritan duty to help others in need.\nThe thought is that \u201cwhat ultimately legitimizes a state\u2019s\nimposition upon your liberty is not merely the services it\nprovides you, but the benefits it provides\nothers\u201d (Wellman 1996: 213; his emphasis). Wellman\nargues that because \u201cpolitical society is the only vehicle with\nwhich people can escape the perils of the state of nature\u201d\n(Wellman 1996: 216), people have a samaritan duty to provide to one\nanother the benefits of a state. Associated restrictions of their\nliberty by the state, Wellman claims, are legitimate.\n\nPerfectionist theories offer another alternative. Perfectionist\nconceptions can be found in ancient Chinese philosophy (see Chan 2013;\nJiang 2021). The best-known perfectionist theory in contemporary\nWestern political philosophy is Raz\u2019 service conception of\nlegitimate authority (section 2.1). Raz tries to show how an account\nof legitimacy based on beneficial consequences is compatible with\neveryone having reasons to obey the directives of a legitimate\nauthority. According to Raz (1995: 359), \u201c[g]overnments decide\nwhat is best for their subjects and present them with the results as\nbinding conclusions that they are bound to follow.\u201d The\njustification for this view that Raz gives (\u201cthe normal\njustification thesis\u201d) is, as explained above, that if the\nauthority is legitimate, its directives are such that they help those\ngoverned to better comply with reasons that apply to them. (For\ncriticisms of this approach, see Hershovitz 2003 and 2011, Nussbaum\n2011, and Quong 2011).\n\nPerfectionist theories are often cast as versions of fact-based\nconceptions of political legitimacy. But, as Plato highlighted in the\nRepublic, there isn\u2019t just the question of what the\nright political decisions are, whether construed as those that\nmaximize utility, honor our duties, or realize some perfectionist\nideal. There is also the question of who should be in charge. And the\nanswer that Plato gave to that second question echoes a belief-based\nconception of political legitimacy: it\u2019s those who know best and\nwho are capable of ruling accordingly (Estlund 2003). Seen in that\nlight, even Raz\u2019 service conception of political legitimacy\nappears as a belief-based conception. It holds that \u201cepistemic\nabstinence\u201d is not an option (Raz 1995) and that political\nauthority is legitimate if held by those who know best what reasons\napply to all citizens and exercised accordingly (see Peter 2023 for\nthis interpretation of Raz\u2019 service conception).\n\nBelief-based conceptions of political legitimacy span versions of\nepistocracy as well as versions of epistemic democracy. I\u2019ll\nhave more to say about epistemic democracy in section 4, so let me\nfocus on epistocratic conceptions here. Epistocratic conceptions of\npolitical legitimacy are best understood in opposition to the\ndemocratic commitment to strict political equality among the citizens\n(see section 4). The idea is captured by Jason Brennan\u2019s\n\u201cantiauthority tenet\u201d (Brennan 2016: 17), which echoes\nDavid Estlund\u2019s \u201cauthority tenet\u201d (2008: 30):\n\u201cWhen some citizens are morally unreasonable, ignorant, or\nincompetent about politics, this justifies not permitting them to\nexercise political authority over others.\u201d\n\nEpistocratic conceptions of political legitimacy can support the\nlegitimacy of authoritarianism, assuming that there is an\nauthoritarian elite that has the right kind of political knowledge and\nis able to effectively rule on that basis. We should not equate\nepistocracy with authoritarianism, however, as epistocracy is also\ncompatible with a Millian plurality voting scheme and similar\npolitical regimes. Still, as highlighted by Ross Mittiga (2022) and\nFabienne Peter (2023), the question has to be addressed whether\nnon-democratic political decision-making can be legitimate in\ncircumstances where the threats to citizens\u2019 lives are enormous\n(through climate change, for example, or pandemics), the evidence for\nwhat needs to be done is sufficiently robust, and the democratic\nprocess is failing to address the issues.\n\nAn important objection to belief-based conceptions of political\nlegitimacy is that they conflate political authority and epistemic\nauthority (Estlund 2008, Darwall 2010, Lafont 2019; see also section 4\nbelow). Raz (2010) rejects this objection, arguing that it only shows\nthat epistemic authority is not sufficient for political authority,\nnot that it is not necessary. Peter (2023) argues that even if this\nobjection can be refuted, belief-based conceptions of political\nlegitimacy often (but not necessarily always) fail because political\ndecision-making remains epistemically underdetermined.\n",
