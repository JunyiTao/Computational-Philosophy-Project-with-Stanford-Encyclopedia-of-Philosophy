    "main_text": "The Limits of Criminal Law\n4. The Limits of Criminal Law\n\n\nNo-one denies that some things should not be criminalized. What is\nless clear is how we are to work out what these things are. One\napproach is to seek constraints on permissible\ncriminalization. Even if the values that justify having criminal law\ncount in favour of criminalization, our reasons to do so may be\ndefeated by reasons that count against. A constraint identifies\nconditions under which the latter reasons always win. Consider, for\nexample, the wrongfulness constraint:\n\n(W)\nIt is only permissible to criminalize \\(\\phi\\)ing if \\(\\phi\\)ing\nis morally wrongful conduct.\n\n\n\nPrinciples like (W) give us a line we can draw without reference to\n(at least some) morally salient particulars. Conduct that falls\noutside the line may not be criminalized come what may. Imagine we are\nconsidering whether to make it a crime to possess guns. Doing so will\nprevent a great deal of harmful wrongdoing that cannot be prevented\notherwise. This is a powerful moral reason to criminalize. But if (W)\nis sound, and gun possession is not morally wrongful, that powerful\nreason is irrelevant to the decision with which we are faced. We are\nnot permitted to criminalize, however much harm criminalization would\nprevent (Moore 1997, 72\u201373; Simester and von Hirsch 2011,\n22\u201323; Duff 2014b, 218\u2013222).\n\n\nSome suspect that all purported constraints on criminalization fail\n(Duff et al 2014, 44\u201352; Tadros 2016, 91\u2013107). This is not\nto say that anything goes. It is rather to say that we cannot use a\nline like that drawn by (W) to work out what is permissibly\ncriminalized. To trace the limits of the criminal law, we must engage\nin a more complex normative exercise: we must consider all morally\nsalient particulars of proposed criminal laws\u2014giving those\nparticulars due weight in our deliberations\u2014and thereby\ndetermine whether each proposal should be enacted. The limits of the\ncriminal law cannot be traced in advance of this exercise. Instead,\nthey are determined by it.\n\n\nThe constraint to which most attention has been paid is the so-called\nharm principle. It is nowadays widely recognised that there is no\nsingle such principle. Rather, there are many harm principles (Tadros\n2011a; Tomlin 2014b; Edwards 2014). One important distinction is\nbetween the harmful conduct principle (HCP) and the\nharm prevention principle (HPP):\n\n(HCP)\nIt is only permissible to criminalize \\(\\phi\\)ing if \\(\\phi\\)ing\nis harmful conduct, or conduct that unreasonably risks harm.\n(HPP)\nIt is only permissible to criminalize \\(\\phi\\)ing if criminalizing\n\\(\\phi\\)ing is necessary to prevent harm, and if the harm done by\ncriminalization is not disproportionate to the harm prevented.\n\n\n\nThese principles have very different implications. That conduct is\nharmful, or unreasonably risks harm, does not show that we will\nprevent a proportionate amount of harm by criminalizing\nit. Conversely, we may be able to prevent harm only by criminalizing\nconduct that is harmless, and that does not unreasonably risk\nharm.\n\n\nTo see the first point, consider the use of drugs. Criminalizing use\nmay turn a drug into forbidden fruit that is more attractive to\npotential consumers, and place production in the hands of criminal\ngangs who make consumption ever more harmful. Users may become less\nwilling to seek medical treatment for fear of exposing their\ncriminality, and may end up with criminal records that lead to social\nexclusion, and damage their employment prospects for years to come\n(United Nations 2015). Where criminalization does have these effects,\nthe harm it does is out of all proportion to any harm prevented. Even\nif (HCP) is satisfied, (HPP) is not.\n\n\nTo see the second point, consider the possession of guns. Possessing a\ngun is not itself harmful. And many possess guns without unreasonably\nrisking harm. If one endorses (HCP), one must either weaken\none\u2019s chosen principle or accept that gun possession cannot be\ncriminalized.  If one endorses (HPP), things are different. What\nmatters is not the effect of each instance of gun possession, but the\neffect of criminalizing all of them: if criminalizing possession will\nprevent harm that would not otherwise be prevented\u2014and do so at\na not disproportionate cost\u2014the fact that some owners possess\nguns safely is beside the point. Whether or not (HCP) is satisfied,\n(HPP) is.\n\n\nConstraints like (W), (HCP), and (HPP) require clarification. To\napply (W) we need to know what makes something morally wrongful.\nPlausibly enough, it is morally wrongful to \\(\\phi\\) only if there is\ndecisive reason not to \\(\\phi\\). But while this is necessary, it may not\nbe sufficient. I have decisive reason not to go out in the rain without\nmy umbrella. But it does not seem morally wrongful to do so (Tadros\n2016, 11\u201346). Whatever the correct criterion, we must ask how\nlaw-makers are to apply it. Are law-makers to ask whether most members\nof society believe \\(\\phi\\)ing to be morally wrongful\u2014a\nmatter of conventional morality\u2014or are they to ask whether this\nis what members would ideally believe\u2014a matter of critical\nmorality (Hart 1963; Devlin 1965)? We must also ask whether just any\nmorally wrongful act will do. Some wrongful acts also violate rights,\nsuch that those who commit them wrong others. On one view, it is only\nwhen \\(\\phi\\)ing meets this additional test that it is permissible to\ncriminalize \\(\\phi\\)ing (Feinberg 1984; Stewart 2010).\n\n\nSome crimes are mala in se\u2014they criminalize conduct\nthat is morally wrongful independently of the law. Most crimes are\nmala prohibita\u2014they criminalize conduct that, if morally\nwrongful at all, is morally wrongful partly in virtue of the fact that\nit is unlawful. Is (W) compatible with the existence of mala\nprohibita? That depends on the extent to which changes in the law\ncan produce changes in morality. The rules of the road are the classic\ncase. Apart from the law, it is morally wrongful to drive dangerously.\nSuch conduct is malum in se. What we should do to conform to\nthis moral norm is not always obvious. To help, the law puts in place\nrules that tell us which side of the road to drive on, when to stop,\nand how fast we may go. Imagine we obey these rules. In doing so, we\ndrive more safely than we otherwise would have: we better conform to\nthe moral norm that prohibits dangerous driving. One proposal is that\nit is morally wrongful to violate legal norms that have this effect:\nthat help us better conform to moral norms that exist independently of\nthe law (Gardner 2011, 19\u201321). Mala prohibita of this kind\nwould then be compatible with (W). Of course, things are not so\nstraightforward. Even if legal conformity generally improves\nour moral conformity, there may be exceptional cases in which it does\nnot\u2014in which we can violate the rules of the road without putting\nanyone in danger, or in which violation helps keep everyone safe. And\nthere may be people for whom even the generalization is not\ntrue\u2014whose expertise enables them to systematically violate legal\nnorms without creating risks any greater than those created by the rest\nof us. Can an explanation be given of why these violations are\nnonetheless morally wrongful? If not, (W) implies that even morally\nbeneficial mala prohibita\u2014like the rules of the\nroad\u2014must ultimately be removed from the criminal law (Husak\n2008, 103\u2013119; Simester and von Hirsch 2011, 24\u201329; Wellman 2013).\n\n\n\nTo apply (HCP) and (HPP) we need a conception of harm. Most views\nare comparative: we are harmed by some event if and only if that event\nrenders us worse off in some way relative to some baseline. One\nchallenge is to identify the relevant baseline. Are we harmed by an\nevent if we are worse than we would have been if things had been\ndifferent? If so, different how? Are we harmed if we are worse off than\nwe were immediately beforehand? Or should we focus not on the position\nwe were or would have been in, but on the position we should have been\nin morally speaking (Holtug 2002; Tadros 2016, 187\u2013200)? A second\nchallenge is to determine in what way we must be worse off. The wider\nour answer to this question, the more likely it is that harm principles\ncollapse into their supposed rivals. Some say we are harmed when our\ninterests are set back (Feinberg 1984, 31\u201364). But it is plausible to\nthink that we have interests in avoiding disgust, annoyance, and dismay.\nMany people are disgusted, annoyed, or dismayed by what they take to be\nmorally wrongful. On an interest-based view, they are also harmed. Any\nharm principle that uses this notion of harm thus threatens to permit\ncriminalization of much conventional immorality (Devlin 1965). A\nnarrower view has it that we are harmed only if our future prospects\nare reduced, because we are deprived of valuable abilities or\nopportunities (Raz 1986, 413\u2013414; Gardner 2007, 3\u20134; Simester and von\nHirsch 2011, 36\u201337). Disgust, annoyance, and offence need not\u2014and\noften do not\u2014have this effect. So they need not be\u2014and\noften are not\u2014harmful. But as blinding pain also need not reduce\none\u2019s prospects in life, it is arguable that this view avoids\ncollapse only at the cost of underinclusion (Tadros 2016, 179\u2013180).\n\n\nWhatever view of harm we take, we must also decide whether all harms\ncount for the purposes of a given harm principle. People sometimes harm\nthemselves, they are sometimes harmed by natural events, and harm is\nsometimes done consensually. Recall that if we endorse (HPP), we must\ndecide whether the harm criminalization prevents is proportionate to\nthe harm it does. Can we include all the aforementioned harms in our\ncalculations? Or must we only include harm done to others without their\nconsent (Mill 1859; Dworkin 1972; Feinberg 1986; Coons and Weber 2013)?\nSome point out that whatever law-makers\u2019 aims, most criminal laws\nwill prevent some non-consensual harm (Feinberg 1986, 138\u2013142;\nTadros 2016, 103). Be that as it may, whether we take into account\nother harms remains important: where the scales would otherwise point\nagainst criminalization, giving weight to a wider range of harms may\ntip the balance decisively in its favour.\n\n\nAs well as asking how constraints might be clarified, we must ask how\nthey might be defended. One type of defence proceeds from within\nour theory of ideals. A theory of ideals includes an account\nof the values that bear upon how we should act, and of the priority\nrelations between those values (Hamlin and Stemplowska 2012). To see\nhow such a theory might generate constraints, consider (W). One\nargument for that principle is the argument from conviction\n(Simester and von Hirsch 2011, 19\u201320):\n\n(1)\nTo criminally convict \\(D\\) of \\(\\phi\\)ing is\n    to censure \\(D\\) for having \\(\\phi\\)ed;\n(2)\nTo censure \\(D\\) for having \\(\\phi\\)ed is to\n    convey that \\(D\\)\u2019s \\(\\phi\\)ing was morally wrongful;\n(3)\nIt is morally defamatory to send false messages about the moral\n    status of \\(D\\)\u2019s conduct;\n\u2234(4)\nIt is impermissible to criminalize conduct\n    that is not morally wrongful.\n\n\n\nA second argument is the argument from punishment (Husak\n2008, 92\u2013103):\n\n(1)\nTo criminally punish \\(D\\) is to intentionally harm\n                      \\(D\\), and expose \\(D\\) to social stigma;\n(2)\nWe have a right not to be intentionally harmed\n                      in a way that exposes us to such stigma;\n(3)\nThat right is permissibly infringed only if we \n                      are punished for wrongful conduct;\n\u2234(4)\nIt is impermissible to criminalize \n                      conduct that is not morally wrongful.\n\n\n\nOne response to these arguments is that criminal law does not always\ncensure or stigmatize. Another is that the arguments rely on priority\nclaims that cannot be sustained. The argument from conviction depends\non our accepting that moral defamation cannot be justified. The\nargument from punishment depends on our accepting that those who do\nnot act wrongly have an absolute right not to be punished. These\nclaims may be too strong. To test the second, think again about\npossession of guns. Imagine that we criminalize possession, and that\nwe have good reason to think that we can thereby save many\nlives. \\(D\\) possesses a gun safely because \\(D\\) likes how it looks\nhanging on the wall. We can grant that \\(D\\) would act wrongly if\n\\(D\\)\u2019s conduct risked harm to others, or prevented the state\nfrom saving others\u2019 lives. But as \\(D\\)\u2019s possession is\nsafe, and the state has in fact criminalized possession, neither is\nthe case. Would the state violate \\(D\\)\u2019s rights if it punished\n\\(D\\)? It is plausible to think not. \\(D\\) could very easily have\nrefrained from possessing the gun. And if the state were to refrain\nfrom punishing safe possessors like \\(D\\), more people would be likely\nto possess guns in the mistaken belief that this was safe. This would\nlikely result in some lives being lost. The fact that not punishing\nsafe possessors would probably have this effect is a good reason to\nthink that safe possessors lack a valid complaint if they are\npunished.  It is a good reason to think that it sometimes is\npermissible to punish the morally innocent. If it is, premise (3) of\nthe argument from punishment is false (Tadros 2016,\n329\u2013333).\n\n\nNow consider (HPP). We can imagine a world in which we could flick a\nswitch, sending an electronic signal to \\(D\\)\u2019s brain, the only\neffect of which would be that \\(D\\) would not act wrongly. Whatever one\nthinks of this means of prevention, it is not the means we utilize when\nwe make use of criminal law. Absent perfect compliance, criminal law\nprevents wrongs by publicly making accusations, condemning people as\nwrongdoers, and punishing them for their wrongs. Public accusations\noften stick even if nothing comes of them. Punishment is harmful by its\nvery nature. The lives of \\(D\\)\u2019s family and friends are collateral\ndamage as \\(D\\)\u2019s prospects are reduced. Some claim that we can\njustify causing such harm\u2014at least when the state does the\nharming\u2014only if this is a necessary and proportionate means of\npreventing people being harmed. So it is impermissible to criminalize\nwhen this condition is not satisfied. Hence (HPP) (Raz 1986, 418\u2013420;\nEdwards 2014, 259\u2013262).\n\n\nOne might reply that the harm internal to justified punishment is\nharm we lack reason not to impose. Leaving this aside, it is\nfar from obvious that harm has lexical priority over other values. The\nabove argument for (HPP) seems to depend on this claim. But there is\nwrongdoing that is both serious and harmless. Imagine \\(D\\) violates the\nbodily integrity or sexual autonomy of an unconscious \\(V\\), but this is\nnever discovered and has no further effects (Gardner and Shute 2000;\nRipstein 2006, 218\u2013229). It is plausible to think that the value of\npreventing such wrongs, even when this does not prevent harm, is at\nleast sometimes capable of justifying the harm done by criminalization\n(Tadros 2016, 106\u2013107).\n\n\nA second defence of constraints proceeds from within non-ideal\ntheory: from our account of what should be done when some people\nwill not act as they should. One might say that all criminal\nlaw theory is part of non-ideal theory\u2014that we have reason to\nhave criminal law precisely because people will (otherwise) act\nwrongly. Be that as it may. As well as fallible agents who (would\notherwise) commit crimes, there are fallible agents who make, apply, and\nenforce criminal laws. Any non-ideal theory must also take account of\nthe errors the latter are disposed to make. Some are errors of\napplication and enforcement\u2014errors made when police officers\narrest, prosecutors charge, and courts punish the innocent. More\nimportant for present purposes are the errors law-makers are disposed\nto make when creating crimes. These errors matter here for the\nfollowing reason. Prescriptive norms are often justified on the grounds\nthat they prevent/mitigate errors that would be made in their absence\n(Schauer 1991, 135\u2013166). If followed, speed limits prevent some drivers\nfrom driving in ways that are impeccable in isolation. But the limits\nare justified if they prevent/mitigate errors that drivers would make\nif we did without speed limits, and if preventing/mitigating the errors\nis worth the cost of preventing some driving that is otherwise\nimpeccable. Let us grant that, when followed, constraints like (W) or\n(HPP) prevent some law-makers from criminalizing in ways that are\nimpeccable in isolation. The constraints may be justified if they\nprevent/mitigate errors law-makers would make if they did without them,\nand if preventing/mitigating the errors is worth the cost of preventing\ncriminalization that is otherwise impeccable.\n\n\nMany defenders of (HPP) offer defences that proceed in the manner\njust described. One error is that of underestimating the value in lives\nvery different from our own: of mistaking the virtues required to\nsucceed in those lives for vices, and of concluding that these supposed\nvices ought to be suppressed (Raz 1986, 401\u2013407; Gardner 2007,\n118\u2013120). A second error is that of underestimating the value of\ntoleration. That value includes making space for experiments in living,\nwhich both help combat prejudice by exposing people to the unfamiliar,\nand help people develop deliberative faculties by exposing them to that\nwith which they disagree (Mill 1859; Brink 2013). A third error is that\nof underestimating the harm one\u2019s policies do to those who live\nin very different circumstances (Green 2013b, 202). If the main effects\nof criminalizing drug use are felt in communities the affluent shun, it\nis not hard to see how law-makers could be blind to the amount of\ndamage criminalization does. Law-makers who make each of these errors\nwill be tempted to create criminal laws that are anything but\nimpeccable\u2014laws designed to suppress activities the value in\nwhich has been missed, which do much more harm than their designers\nanticipated. The case for (HPP) is that it stands in the way of this\ntemptation. Those who follow it must tolerate conduct\u2014however\noffensive or immoral they deem it to be\u2014unless they can show that\ncriminalization is a necessary and proportionate means of preventing\nharm.\n\n\nHarm-based arguments are nowadays ubiquitous when proposed criminal\nlaws are discussed. Some think this shows that (HPP) is no constraint\nat all (Harcourt 1999). But it is no surprise that those who merely pay\nlip service to a principle are not constrained by it. The argument of\nthe previous paragraph was an argument that (HPP) should be\nfollowed. To follow that principle is to take seriously the\nneed for an empirical showing\u2014grounded in adequate\nevidence\u2014that a given law is necessary to prevent a proportionate\namount of harm. A better objection is that the error-based argument is\nincomplete. How widespread would error be if law-makers took themselves\nto be free of (HPP)? When are the benefits of following (HPP)\u2014in\nerrors prevented\u2014worth the costs\u2014in otherwise impeccable\ncriminal laws? Might there be some other rule that brings us those\nbenefits at a lower cost than (HPP)? We need answers to all these\nquestions, and more, to know if an argument from within non-ideal\ntheory can support (HPP) (Tadros 2016, 94\u201396).\n\n\nA number of other possible constraints on the criminal law have been\nproposed (Dan-Cohen 2002, 150\u2013171; Ripstein 2006). As mentioned\nearlier, some are skeptical of all such principles. To determine the\nlimits of the criminal law, they think, we must refer to a \u2018more\ndisorderly set of considerations\u2019, none of which gives us\nanything as simple as a (set of) constraint(s): the resulting account\nof criminal law\u2019s limits will be \u2018messier\u2019 than its\nrivals; but this is \u2018what the messy worlds in which we live\nrequire\u2019 (Duff et al 2014, 51\u201352). The correct response to\nthis skepticism remains unclear. One possibility is that a defensible\ngeneral line can indeed be found. The question is where the line is,\nand how it is to be defended against objections like those sketched\nabove. A second possibility is that we need the \u2018messier\u2019\ntheory. If so, we must ask what shape that theory ought to take, and\nhow lofty should be the ambitions of those who construct it. We need\nto know how much order can be imposed, at the theoretical level, on\nthe \u2018disorderly set of considerations\u2019 with which we are\nconfronted (for one answer, see Tadros 2016, 159\u2013172). As the\ncriminal law\u2019s scope in many jurisdictions continues to expand\nat a dizzying pace, these remain the most urgent questions facing\ntoday\u2019s philosophers of criminal law.\n",
