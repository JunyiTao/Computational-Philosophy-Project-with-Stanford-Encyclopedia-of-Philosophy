    "main_text": "Current Views on Thought Experiments || Experimentalism\n4.5 Experimentalism\n\nWhat we might term \u201cexperimentalism\u201d encompasses a wide\nrange of different approaches which all advance the view that thought\nexperiments are a \u201climiting case\u201d of ordinary experiments.\nExperimentalism was proposed first by Ernst Mach (1897 and 1905). He\ndefines experimenting in terms of its basic method of variation and\nits capacity to destroy prejudices about nature. According to Mach,\nexperimenting is innate to higher animals, including humans. The\nthought experiment just happens on a higher intellectual level but is\nbasically still an experiment. At the centre of thought experimenting\nis a \u201cGedankenerfahrung\u201d, an experience in thought. Such\nan experience is possible because thought experiments draw from\n\u201cunwillk\u00fcrliche Abbildungen von Tatsachen\u201d\n(non-arbitrary images of facts) acquired in past experiences of the\nworld. Some thought experiments are so convincing in their results\nthat an execution seems unnecessary; others could be conducted in a\nreal-world experiment, which is the most natural trajectory of a\nscientific thought experiment. In any case thought experiments can\nresult in a revision of belief, thereby demonstrating their\nsignificance for scientific progress. Mach also appreciates the\ndidactic value of thought experiments: they help us to realize what\ncan be accomplished in thinking and what cannot.\n\nIn the spirit of Mach, Sorensen (1992) has offered an aspiring version\nof experimentalism that accounts for thought experiments in science\nand philosophy, and tackles many of the central issues of the topic.\nSorensen claims that thought experiments are \u201ca subset of\nunexecuted experiments\u201d (1992, p. 213). By their logical nature\nthey are paradoxes that aim to test modal consequences of\npropositions. The origin of our capacity of thought experimentation is\nexplained in terms of Darwinian evolution (as in Genz 1999, pp.\n25\u201329), though the explanation has been criticized to be only\nlittle more than a \u2018just so story\u2019 that fails, on a\nposteriori grounds, to epistemically underwrite that capacity (see\nMaffie 1997). Others are more optimistic (see Shepard 2008).\n\nExperimentalism does not have to take a naturalistic turn as it does\nin Sorensen\u2019s case. In a number of contributions Marco Buzzoni\nhas defended a Neo-Kantian version of experimentalism (see Buzzoni\n2004, 2007, 2008, 2011, 2011b, 2013, 2013b). Buzzoni (2008) argues for\nthe dialectical unity of thought experiments and real-world\nexperiments. Thought experiments and real-world experiments are\nclaimed to be identical on the \u201ctechnological-operational\u201d\nlevel, and at least in science, one is impossible without the other:\nwithout thought experiments there wouldn\u2019t be real-world\nexperiments because we would not know how to put questions to nature;\nwithout real-world experiments there wouldn\u2019t be answers to\nthese questions or experience from which they could draw. Given the\nmany scientific thought experiments that cannot be realized in the\nreal-world, Buzzoni might be conflating thought experiments with\nimagined experiments to be carried out in the real-world (see Fehige\n2012, 2013b; and Buzzoni 2013b).\n\nIdealizations are common in both real experiments and thought\nexperiments. So-called Aristotelian idealization might ignore, say,\nthe colour of a falling object. Galilean idealizations ignore some\nphysical aspects, such as air friction, to get at the underlying\nphysics (McMullin 1985). So-called Platonic idelization goes beyond\nthis and ignores what would be actually seen even in a Galilean\nidealization. For instance, a rapidly moving object in special\nrelativity would not look contracted, but rather would look rotated\n(surprisingly, this phenomenon is not well known). This rotation is\nignored as an irrelevant optical phenomenon to yield the correct\nthought experiment visualization, which is the well-known Lorentz\ncontraction (Brown 2013).\n",
