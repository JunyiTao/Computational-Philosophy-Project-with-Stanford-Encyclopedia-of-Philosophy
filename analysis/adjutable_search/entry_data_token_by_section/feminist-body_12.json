Biology and the New Materialisms\n\nButler\u2019s (1993) thinking together of the material and the\ndiscursive, has, however, been criticized, for not allowing the body\nmore of a drag on signification (Alaimo and Hekman 2008; Lennon and Alsop 2019). Such a \u201cflight from\nthe material\u201d according to Alaimo and Hekman, has foreclosed\nattention to \u201clived material bodies and evolving corporeal\npractices\u201d (2008: 3). To correct such a deficit, in the\nframework of what is termed the new materialism, what is stressed\ninstead is that, although \u201clanguage structures how we apprehend\nthe ontological, it doesn\u2019t constitute it\u201d (2008: 98). The\ninsight of the new materialist discussions has been to ensure that\nmatter, the material, is accorded an active role in this relation.\n\nFor Grosz, there is: \n\n\nan elision of the question of nature and of matter in Butler\u2019s\nwork. Mattering becomes more important than matter! Being\n\u201cimportant\u201d, having significance, having a place,\nmattering, is more important than matter, substance or materiality.\n(interview with Ausch, Doane, and Perez 2000) \n\n\nIn Grosz\u2019s own work such materiality is conceived of in terms of\n\u201cactive forces\u201d. The body is involved in a process of\nactive \u201cbecoming\u201d which outruns any account which might be\noffered of it within culture. In the same interview she claims:\n\u201cNature is \u2026 is openness, resource, productivity\u201d.\nHere the body is not simply a materiality which outruns any attempt to\nconceptualize it; it is actively involved in processes of change and\ntransformation. Grosz\u2019s recent work (1999 [2008]), exploring\nbiology and its relationship to culture, shows an increasing interest\nin unravelling the nature/culture opposition by a stress on \u201cthe\nvirtualities, the potentialities, within biological existence that\nenable cultural, social, and historical forces to work with and\ntransform that existence\u201d (1999 [2008: 24]). Returning to the work of\nDarwin, she sees in his work \u201cthe genesis of the new from the\nplay of repetition and difference within the old\u201d (2008: 28).\nNonetheless she draws some problematic conclusions which are not\nendorsed by current feminist biologists (Fausto-Sterling 2000; Fine\n2012, 2017). In embracing natural selection she appears to give it a\nfoundational explanatory role so that \n\n\nlanguage, culture, intelligence, reason, imagination memory, -terms\ncommonly claimed as defining characteristics of the human and the\ncultural-are all equally effects of the same rigorous criteria of\nnatural selection. (Grosz 1999 [2008: 44]) \n\n\nMoreover within this process a binary sexual difference is required,\nas, \u201cone of the ontological characteristics of life\nitself\u201d (1999 [2008: 44]). And this sexual differentiation and the\nsexual selection with which, for her, it is interwoven, is then\ninvoked to ground racial and other forms of bodily differences.\n\nGrosz\u2019s endorsement of a biology which renders the sexual binary\nunassailable, has been criticized for going beyond recognizing the\nimportance of the material, to privilege a particular biological\naccount of matter (Jagger 2015). The history of sex difference research show\nthat the biological theories, which give an account of sex\ndifferences, are the products of particular historical and culturally\nspecific moments of production. Such a recognition has allowed\nbiological accounts of sex differences to be revisited with an eye as\nto where cultural assumptions about gender have influenced them. Of\nkey importance in this regard has been the assumption that there are\nsimply two sexes, male and female, a model which has come\nincreasingly under challenge. Fausto-Sterling points out the range of\ninter-sex bodies that are forced into a binary classificatory system\n(1992, 2000). She points out that \u201cthe varieties are so diverse\n\u2026 that no classificatory scheme could do more than suggest the\nvariety of sexual anatomy encountered in clinical practice\u201d\n(1993: 22). Oudshoorn (1994), in a genealogy of the emergence of the\ntheory of sex hormones, shows how a model of binary sex differences\nprevailed, in a context in which dualistic notions of male and female\ncould have been abandoned (see entry\n feminist philosophies of biology\n and also Fausto-Sterling 1992, 2000; Fine 2012, 2017). Lane argues\nthat \n\n\nmobilizing a reading of biology as open-ended and creative, supports a\nperspective that sees sex and gender diversity as a continuum, rather\nthan a dichotomy\u2014put simply, \u201cnature\u201d throws up all\nthis diversity and society needs to accept it. (2009: 137) \n\n\nLane, as a trans theorist, is confronting what is seen as an\nanti-biologism within performative gender theory, and exploring the\ncomplex interpellation of biological and cultural factors in the\naetiology of trans subjectivity, without treating Grosz\u2019s\nbiological account as authoritative (see entry on\n feminist perspectives on trans issues).\n\nThis is not to deny that there is something independent of our\nconceptualizations which sets constraints on what can be said about\nit. What we cannot do is disentangle the bit which is given\nfrom our ways of thinking about it. What needs addressing according to\nBarad is \u201cthe entanglement of matter and meaning\u201d (Barad\n2007), the inter-implication of the discursive and the material in\nwhich no priority is given to either side. Barad explores this\nentanglement with particular reference to the work of physicist Niels\nBohr. Viewing matter as an active \u201cagent\u201d ensures that\nmatter and meaning are mutually articulated. Importantly, however,\nalthough the empirical world of matter takes an active part this does\nnot involve according it some sort of immediate givenness, or a\nstraight-forwardly determining role. In her approach Barad is\nfollowing in the footsteps of Haraway. In 1985, prior to\nButler\u2019s Gender Trouble, Haraway had published her\n\u201cCyborg Manifesto\u201d (1985 [1991]). Haraway\u2019s project\nhad some overlap with that later articulated by Butler. She wished to\novercome the binary between nature and culture, replacing the two\nterms with nature/culture, in which different elements cannot\nbe disentangled. She was also concerned to draw attention to the\ncomplex factors which go into constituting what is to count as nature\nfor us. Most crucially she was concerned to undermine the supposed\nnaturalness of certain binaries; insisting on a breaching of\nboundaries between human and animal and between animal and machine. So\ncame her invocation of the cyborg: a creature\n\u201csimultaneously animal and machine\u201d populating a world\n\u201cambiguously natural and crafted\u201d (1985 [1991: 149]). In\npointing to the cyborg as the figure which captures our \u201cbodily\nreality\u201d, Haraway is resisting any appeal to a pure nature which\nis supposed to constitute our bodily being. There is no clear boundary\nbetween what is natural and what is constructed. In Haraway\u2019s\npicture, however, the body, along with the rest of the natural world,\nhas what she calls \u201ca trickster quality that resists categories\nand projects of all kinds\u201d (1997: 128). In this and her later\nwork (Haraway 2003, 2008), her account of the quirkiness and agency which, in\nButler, is primarily discussed as a feature of discursive practices,\nis as much a feature of nature. Nature is viewed as an agent, actively\ncontributing to the indivisible nature/culture with which we\nare faced. \u201cWe must find another relationship to nature besides\nreification, possession, appropriation and nostalgia\u201d (2008:\n158). This other relation is to view nature as \u201ca partner in the\npotent conversation\u201d (2008: 158), in which we attempt to\nconstitute it. What is so notable about her work is the careful\nrespect shown to the concreteness of bodily existence and to the\nbiological narratives, alongside narratives of historical and cultural\nkinds.\n",
