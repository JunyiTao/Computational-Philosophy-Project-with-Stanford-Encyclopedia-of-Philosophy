    "main_text": "Theory of Decoherence || Comparison\n1.3 Comparison\n\nWork on environmental decoherence and that on decoherent histories tend to\nbe unfortunately rather separate. In comparing the two, we shall need\nto look both at cases that can be described by both formalisms (and\nask whether or not the two descriptions are equivalent), and at cases\nwhere only the more abstract formalism of decoherent histories\napplies.\n\nWith regard to the latter, there are of course cases in which the\ndecoherence functional vanishes just by numerical coincidence. But\nthere are also systematic cases of vanishing of interference\neven without environmental monitoring, namely in the presence of\n\u2018conservation-induced\u2019 decoherence (see e.g. Halliwell\n2010). As an example, take an isolated system (say, with discrete\nenergy levels), and consider histories composed of projections onto\nits energy states at arbitrary times. Because energy is conserved, in\nthe energy basis each individual component is following the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation without interfering with the other\ncomponents, and the corresponding histories decohere. While some\nauthors in the decoherent histories literature take\nconservation-induced decoherence to be a significant novelty of the\ntheory, it should be noted that it lacks the robustness of\nenvironment-induced decoherence, since it lacks a mechanism that\nactively suppresses interference.\n\nWith regard to the former case, environmental decoherence can be\neasily described also in terms of decoherent histories. One needs to\ntake times that are separated by intervals larger than the decoherence\ntime scale, and projections onto the preferred states. Then the\nenvironmental monitoring ensures that the resulting histories\ndecohere. (In case of a continuous set of preferred states, one might\nneed to generalise the histories formalism slightly, using\n\u2018effects\u2019 rather than projections; see e.g. Kent 1998.) In\nthis sense, environmental decoherence can be seen as a special case of\ndecoherent histories, but the descriptions given by the two formalisms\nare somewhat different. While decoherent histories define\nmulti-time distributions over the preferred states (at discrete\ntimes), models of environmental decoherence essentially describe\nsingle-time distributions over the preferred states. While they\nhave the advantage of being well-defined at all times, these\nsingle-time distributions do not explicitly describe any temporal\nevolution at the level of the individual components. \n\nIn a number of models of environmental decoherence, however, it is\nobvious what the dynamical behaviour should be even at the level of\nindividual components. Specifically, in models where the preferred\nstates are coherent states, comparison of the master equation for the\nreduced state of the system with the evolution of a classical\nLiouville distribution suggests that the trajectories of individual\ncomponents in fact approximate surprisingly well the corresponding\nNewtonian trajectories. Intuitively, one can explain this by noting\nthat the preferred states (which are wave packets that are narrow in\nposition and remain so because they are also narrow in momentum) are\nthe states that tend to get least entangled with the environment.\nTherefore they will tend to follow the Schr\u00f6dinger equation more\nor less undisturbed. But, as a matter of fact, narrow wave packets\nfollow approximately Newtonian trajectories, at least if the external\npotentials in which they move are uniform enough across the width of\nthe packets (results of this kind are known as \u2018Ehrenfest\ntheorems\u2019). Thus, the resulting trajectories will be close to\nNewtonian ones (on the relevant\n scales).[11]\n\nThis picture cannot be exact, because as soon as a localised\nwave packet has spread enough, it will be decohered into new more\nlocalised packets, so that intuitively one will get some kind of\n\u2018fanning out\u2019 of trajectories. In fact, such deviations\nfrom Newtonian behaviour are due both to the tendency of the\nindividual components to spread and to the localising effect of the\ninteraction with the environment, which further enhances the\ncollective spreading of the components (because a narrowing in\nposition corresponds to a widening in momentum). See Rosaler (2016)\nfor a very nice treatment (that uses an \u2018open systems\u2019\nversion of Ehrenfest). A vivid example are the observed trajectories\nof \\(\\alpha\\)-particles in a cloud chamber, which are indeed extremely\nclose to Newtonian ones, except for additional tiny\n \u2018kinks\u2019.[12]\n\nIn other models, e.g. when the electromagnetic field privileges the\nstationary states of an atom, there is no such comparison with\nclassical equations, and the lack of multi-time distributions becomes\na limitation of the model. Such limitations might be overcome by\ncombining models of environmental decoherence with more\nphenomenological models of \u2018continuous measurement\u2019 (as\ndone in a different example by Bhattacharya, Habib and Jacobs 2000).\nAs shown by Brun (2002), the dynamics of stationary states (quantum\njumps!) can be obtained from first principles in the decoherent\nhistories formalism. \n",
