    "main_text": "A Democratic Conception of Legitimate Political Authority || Limits to Democratic Authority\n8. Legitimate Political Authority in International Institutions\n\n\nInternational Institutions have acquired political authority over the\nlast half century or so.  They are quite diverse in character.  For\nsome, their authority has a somewhat different form than the authority\nassociated with the organs of the state.  And the grounds of the\nauthority of international institutions may be distinct as\nwell. Overall, these are complex institutions with a number of parts\nand so different principles may apply to the different parts.  For\nexample, with regard to the World Trade Organization, some principle\nof state consent may be the ultimate basis of the legitimacy of its\nlaw making function, while a very different kind of standard would be\nrelevant to judging the legitimacy of the dispute settlement\nmechanism.\n\n\nBecause global institutions operate in the context of a lack of\noverarching and centralized political power, the form and grounds of\nauthority are likely often to be distinct.  As I noted above, some of\nthe most powerful global institutions have powers to create\npermissions rather than duties as in Security Council of the United\nNations authorizations of the use of force. Another example is when\nthe World Trade Organization's dispute settlement mechanism rules that\na state may restrict trade with another state in what would normally\nbe a violation of their agreements in order to retaliate against a\nstate that has violated the trade agreements.\n\n\nAnother interesting feature of international institutions is that\nstate consent appears to be a possible basis for the legitimacy of\ninternational institutions.  To be sure many would argue that\ninternational institutions ought to be evaluated solely on an\ninstrumental basis and others would argue that only democratic\ninternational institutions can be legitimate.  But state consent does\nhave a fighting chance of playing a large role in underpinning these\ninstitutions.  The international system is highly decentralized and\nstates are by far the most important instruments for making power\naccountable to persons that we know of.\n\n\nTo be sure, the state consent doctrine raises many questions.  For one\nthing, we must ask whether the consent of states that do not represent\ntheir peoples is a genuinely legitimating act.  Second, we must ask\nabout the fairness of the conditions under which consent is given.  If\nthe conditions are unfair and more powerful states take advantage of\nthe vulnerabilities of the weaker state, what impact does this have on\nthe legitimacy of the state?  Third, what normative weight, if any,\nattaches to a state's refusal of consent when it's cooperation is\nnecessary to the achievement of morally mandatory aims such as the\nprevention or mitigation of global warming?\n",
