    "main_text": "Deflationism || The redundancy theory\n5.1 The redundancy theory\n\nDeflationist ideas appear quite early on, including a well-known\nargument against correspondence in Frege (1918\u201319). However,\nmany deflationists take their cue from an idea of Ramsey (1927), often\ncalled the equivalence thesis:\n\n\\(\\ulcorner \\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner\\)\nis true \\(\\urcorner\\) has the same meaning as \\(\\phi\\).\n\n\n(Ramsey himself takes truth-bearers to be propositions rather than\nsentences. Glanzberg (2003b) questions whether Ramsey\u2019s account\nof propositions really makes him a deflationist.)\n\nThis can be taken as the core of a theory of truth, often called the\nredundancy theory. The redundancy theory holds that there is\nno property of truth at all, and appearances of the expression\n\u2018true\u2019 in our sentences are redundant, having no effect on\nwhat we express.\n\nThe equivalence thesis can also be understood in terms of speech acts\nrather than meaning:\n\nTo assert that \\(\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner\\) is true is\njust to assert that \\(\\phi\\).\n\n\nThis view was advanced by Strawson (1949; 1950), though Strawson also\nargues that there are other important aspects of speech acts involving\n\u2018true\u2019 beyond what is asserted. For instance, they may be\nacts of confirming or granting what someone else said. (Strawson would\nalso object to my making sentences the bearers of truth.)\n\nIn either its speech act or meaning form, the redundancy theory argues\nthere is no property of truth. It is commonly noted that the\nequivalence thesis itself is not enough to sustain the redundancy\ntheory. It merely holds that when truth occurs in the outermost\nposition in a sentence, and the full sentence to which truth is\npredicated is quoted, then truth is eliminable. What happens in other\nenvironments is left to be seen. Modern developments of the redundancy\ntheory include Grover et al. (1975).\n",
