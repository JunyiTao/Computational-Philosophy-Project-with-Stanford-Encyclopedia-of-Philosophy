    "main_text": "The Inferential Conception\n5. The Inferential Conception\n\nThe core idea of the inferential conception is to analyse scientific\nrepresentation in terms of the inferential function of scientific\nmodels. In the previous accounts discussed, a model\u2019s\ninferential capacity dropped out of whatever it was that was supposed\nto answer the ER-problem (or SR-problem): proposed morphisms or\nsimilarity relations between models and their targets for example. The\naccounts discussed in this section reverse this order and explain\nscientific representation directly in terms of surrogative\nreasoning.\n",
