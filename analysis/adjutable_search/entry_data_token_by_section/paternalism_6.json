These interests are defined in terms of\nthe things that make a person\u2019s life go better; in particular\ntheir physical and psychological condition. It is things like death or\nmisery or painful emotional states which are in question. Sometimes,\nhowever, advocates of state intervention seek to protect the moral\nwelfare of the person. So, for example, it may be argued that\nprostitutes are better off being prevented from plying their trade\neven if they make a decent living and their health is protected\nagainst disease. They are better off because it is morally corrupting\nto sell one\u2019s sexual services. The interference is justified,\ntherefore, to promote the moral well-being of the person. This then\ncan be called moral paternalism. Still another distinction within\nmoral paternalism is between interferences to improve a person\u2019s\nmoral character, and hence her well-being, and interferences to make\nsomeone a better person\u2014even if her life does not go better for\nher as a result. \n\nFinally, it is important to distinguish paternalism, whether welfare\nor moral, from other ideas used to justify interference with persons;\neven cases where the interference is not justified in terms of\nprotecting or promoting the interests of others. In particular moral\npaternalism should be distinguished from legal moralism, i.e., the\nidea that certain ways of acting are morally wrong or degrading and\nmay be prohibited. So, for example, the barroom \u201csport\u201d of\ndwarf tossing (where dwarfs who are paid, and are protected with\nhelmets, etc. participate in contests to see who can throw them\nfurthest) might be thought to be legitimately prohibited. Not because\nthe dwarf is injured in any way, not because the dwarf corrupts\nhimself by agreeing to participate in such activities, but simply\nbecause the activity is wrong.\n\nTo be sure it is not always easy to distinguish between legal moralism\nand moral paternalism. If one believes, as Plato does, that acting\nwrongly damages the soul of the agent, then it will be possible to\ninvoke moral paternalism rather than legal moralism. What is important\nis that there are two distinct justifications that are possible; one\nappealing to the mere immorality of the conduct interfered with, the\nother to the harm done to the agent\u2019s character.\n",
