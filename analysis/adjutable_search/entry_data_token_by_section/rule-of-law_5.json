    "main_text": "History of the Rule of Law || Montesquieu\n3.3 Montesquieu\n\nMontesquieu\u2019s work on the Rule of Law is best known in\nconnection with his insistence on the separation of\npowers\u2014particularly the separation of judicial power from\nexecutive and legislative authority (see Montesquieu 1748: Bk. 11, Ch.\n6). The judiciary has to be able to do its work as the mouthpiece of\nthe laws without being distracted from fresh decisions made in the\ncourse of its considerations by legislators and policy-makers.\nMontesquieu\u2019s views on the separation of powers had a profound\neffect on the American founding, particularly in the work of James\nMadison (Federalist Papers, \u00a747).\n\nElsewhere in The Spirit of the Laws, Montesquieu developed a\ntheory of the value of legalism. Noting that despotic governments tend\nto have very simple laws which they administered peremptorily with\nlittle respect for procedural delicacy, Montesquieu argued that legal\nand procedural complexity tended to be associated with respect for\npeople\u2019s dignity. He associated this sort of respect with a\nmonarchy ruling by law, as opposed to despotism:\n\n\nIn monarchies, the administering of a justice that hands down\ndecisions not only about life and goods, but also about honor,\nrequires scrupulous inquiries. The fastidiousness of the judge grows\nas more issues are deposited with him, and as he pronounces upon\ngreater interests. (Montesquieu 1748: Bk. VI, ch. 1, p. 72)\n\n\nThis emphasis on the value of complexity\u2014the way in which\ncomplicated laws, particularly laws of property, provide hedges\nbeneath which people can find shelter from the intrusive demands of\npower\u2014has continued to fascinate modern theorists of the rule of\nlaw (e.g., Thompson 1975: 258\u201369).\n\nIn the modern debate we also hear echoes of the doctrine propounded in\nThe Spirit of the Laws (1748: Bk. 26, ch. 15, p.510) that\n\u201cthings that depend on principles of civil right must not be\nruled by principles of political right\u201d. \u201cCivil\nright\u201d\u2014Montesquieu\u2019s word for what we call private\nlaw\u2014is, he said, \u201cthe palladium of property\u201d, and it\nshould be allowed to operate according to its own logic, not burdened\nwith the principles of public or political regulation. A failure of\nthe Rule of Law in this regard is likely to lead to the impoverishment\nof an economy, as expectations collapse, and owners\u2019 incentives\nfor production and enterprise are undermined (Montesquieu 1748: Bk. V,\nch. 14, p. 61).\n",
