    "main_text": "The Lockean Legacy || Animalism and the Human/Person Distinction\n2.2 Animalism and the Human/Person Distinction\n\nIt should be emphasized at this point that animalists do not deny that\nthere is a distinction to be drawn between human animals and persons.\nThis, in part, is why the formulation of (1) that is sometimes\nascribed to animalists\u2014\u201cpersons are human\nanimals\u201d\u2014is misleading. In fact, there are several aspects\nof Locke\u2019s discussion that animalists uphold.\n\nFor example, animalists often ally their answer to the persistence\nquestion with Locke\u2019s identity criteria for human animals (e.g.,\nOlson 2007: 28). Of course, since organic animalists affirm and\nsomatic animalists deny that being alive is a necessary condition of\nour persistence, Locke cannot be an ally to both camps. For his part,\nD. Mackie (1999b: 235\u201339) classifies Locke as an organicist.\nHowever, enough passages from the Essay suggest otherwise\n(some of which Mackie himself acknowledges\u2014e.g., in\nII.xxvii.4\u20135) that the more circumspect conclusion may be that\nLocke was either inconsistent or just ambivalent on the matter.\nAnimalists are also sympathetic to Locke\u2019s account of\npersonhood\u2014albeit with a different understanding of the type of\nconcept person is\u2014and this alternative understanding\nallows animalists to endorse element (d) above.\n\nWhat animalists reject is Locke\u2019s claim that\n\u2018person\u2019 names a sortal concept (e.g., Snowdon 2014: ch.\n3). Rather, following Olson (1997: ch. 2), most animalists insist that\n\u2018person\u2019 names only a phase sortal concept (or\nstatus concept, see Hacker 2007). (The idea of a\n\u201cphased sortal\u201d, as he called them, is due to Wiggins\n[1967, 2001].) Unlike a sortal concept, which determines the\npersistence conditions of its instances, a phase sortal concept is a\nconcept to which its instances belong temporarily, for only a phase of\ntheir existence (e.g., teenager). Simply by reaching a\nparticular age, for example, something that was not a teenager can\nbecome a teenager without ceasing to exist. Likewise, something that\nwas a teenager can cease to be a teenager without ceasing to exist. So\ntoo, animalists say, with person. Personhood, they claim, is\na phase that something begins upon acquiring the psychological\ncapacities that Locke identifies (self-consciousness and rationality)\nand concludes upon losing those capacities. In this way, being a\nperson is a matter of what something can do, rather than what\nsomething is. In Olson terminology, person is a\n\u201cfunctional kind\u201d, akin to locomotor (1997:\n31\u201337). A locomotor is anything that is able to move about under\nits own power, be it a garden slug or a ballistic missile. Likewise,\nOlson argues (following Locke), a person is anything that is able to\nthink in certain ways\u2014anything that \u201cis rational, \u2026\nordinarily conscious and aware of itself as tracing a path through\ntime and space, \u2026 [and] morally accountable for its\nactions\u201d (1997: 32). Many things besides human animals can be\npersons on this view: an angel, a god, a machine, an animal, an\nimmaterial soul, an alien, etc.. In the case of human animals, we\nordinarily become persons not at conception or at birth, but around\nthe age of two. And while it is possible for a human animal to go out\nof existence at the same moment that she ceases to be a person (e.g.,\nif she steps on an active landmine), it is also possible for a human\nanimal to continue existing long after he has ceased to be a person\n(e.g., if he lapses into a persistent vegetative state).\n",
