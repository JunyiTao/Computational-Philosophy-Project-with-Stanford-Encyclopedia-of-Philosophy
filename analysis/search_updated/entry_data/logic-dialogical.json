    "preamble": "\n\nDialogical logic is a dialogue-based approach to logic and\nargumentation rooted in a research tradition that goes back to\ndialectics in Greek Antiquity, when problems were approached through\ndialogues in which opposing parties discussed a thesis through\nquestions and answers. The dialogical framework was first worked out\nin its modern form by Paul Lorenzen and Kuno Lorenz in the context of\nconstructive mathematics and logic, and inspired many\n\u201cdialogical logics\u201d that follow more or less the initial\nprogram, thus creating what can be called traditions in dialogical\nlogic. This entry focuses on the developments of dialogical logic in\nthe Lorenzen and Lorenz tradition, which developed in the 1990s and\n2000s into a fruitful framework for the study, comparison, and\ncombination of various non-classical systems, giving rise to what has\nbeen called dialogical pluralism. References to the other\ntraditions will nonetheless be provided.\n\nIn the Lorenzen and Lorenz tradition, dialogical logic uses concepts\nof both game and argumentation theory to provide a pragmatist approach\nto meaning and reasoning constituted during the interaction of two\nplayers arguing on a given thesis. The game rules allow these players\nto challenge the other\u2019s statements or defend their own\nstatements in such a way that one player wins and the other loses\nafter a finite number of moves. The meaning of the logical constants\nis provided by a set of interaction rules (the local rules) and the\ndialogical equivalent of a demonstration is a construction of plays\nthrough which it is shown that one player may win whatever the other\nplayer\u2019s moves may be (winning strategy). Thus, both the\ndialogical meaning of the logical constants and the dialogical\nconception of demonstration are constituted by interaction.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. A Brief Overview of Dialogical Logic\n\nIn the dialogical framework the meaning of an expression is explained\nin game-theoretic terms, as opposed to the main-stream model-theoretic\nsemantics. In this fashion, the meaning of the logical constants is\nexplained by means of rules prescribing how to use these constants in\nargumentation games. Various traditions can be distinguished in the\ngame-theoretical approach (see also Rahman & Keiff 2005):\n\n\n\nThe constructivist tradition of Paul Lorenzen and Kuno Lorenz.\n\nThis is the main tradition of dialogical logic and the present entry\nwill focus on it and its recent developments. Dialogical logic is\nconsidered (especially by Lorenz) as a semantic project, and was\ninitially developed in order to overcome the limitations of operative\nlogic (Lorenzen 1955; see also Schroeder-Heister 2008). Dialogues are\nfinitary games about an initial formula, which is said to be\nvalid if, and only if, the proponent has a winning\nstrategy for it (see\n Section 2.1.2).\nExpanding this tradition, Shahid Rahman and collaborators have made dialogical logic a framework for expressing various logics other than the initial intuitionistic logic, as presented in \n Section 2.2\n (see in particular Rahman 1993, Rahman and R\u00fcckert 2001, Rahman and Keiff 2005).  \n\nWalter Felscher (1985) follows a common method for writing winning strategies\n(Lorenzen & Lorenz 1978; Lorenz 1981) that uses the semantic\ntableaux of Beth (1955), and his technical achievements have strongly\ninfluenced some logicians when working with the dialogical framework\nor some variation of it, notably S\u00f8rensen and Urzyczyn (2007);\nAlama et al. (2011); Uckelman et al. (2014); Dutilh Novaes (2015; 2020);\nDutilh Novaes and French (2018); French (2021). Another author which\nhad considerable influence for these works is Christian Ferm\u00fcller, for\nexample Ferm\u00fcller (2003). \n\n\nThe game-theoretical tradition of Jaakko Hintikka (1968), called GTS\n(see the\n entry on independence friendly logic).\n\nThis tradition shares the game-theoretical tenets of dialogical logic\nfor logical constants, but switches to standard model theory at the\nlevel of elementary statements, for which standard truth-functional\nformal semantics comes into play. \n\n\nThe argumentation theory tradition of Else Barth and Erick Krabbe\n(1982; see also Gethmann 1979).\n\nThis tradition links dialogical logic with informal logic (or critical\nreasoning), which originated in the work of Perelman and\nOlbrechts-Tyteca (1958), and studies the underlying logical\nregularities of concrete dialogues. In this tradition figures\nToulmin\u2019s argumentation theory (Toulmin 1958), Barth and\nKrabbe\u2019s theory of dialogue (Barth & Krabbe 1982), Douglas\nWalton (1984), Ralph Johnson (1999), Woods\u2019 argumentation theory\n(Woods 1989; Woods et al. 2000), and critical thinking (Anand\nJayprakash Vaidya 2013, among others). \n\n\nThe ludics tradition of Jean-Yves Girard (2001).\n\nThis tradition provides an overall theory of proof-theoretical meaning\nbased on interactive computation. Andreas Blass (1992) proposed a\ndialogical semantics (in the sense of tradition 1) for linear logics,\nto which ludics is often associated. \n\n\nThe recent developments of dialogical logic in constructive\nmathematics.\n\nNew developments in this field are becoming more and more important\nand it can safely be called a full-fledged tradition. Nowadays, these\ndevelopments are deeply related to the links between dialogical logic\nand constructive type theory, and have even started to make\ninteresting connections with new programs in Philosophy of Mathematics\nsuch as Homotopy Theory. Prominent works related to this field are for\ninstance Coquand (1995) and Sterling (2021). \n\n\nThese traditions sometimes share common features, sometimes challenge\nfeatures of other traditions, sometimes try to make links with other\ntraditions. Thus, traditions 1 and 3 share an epistemic and\nproof-theoretical background. Traditions 2 and 3 challenge the\ndialogical conception of logic of tradition 1 in order to bring about\na framework in which meaning is not reduced to a formal approach, but\nis understood as setting out content. Recent works claim to answer\nthis kind of challenge while still staying within tradition 1 (see\n Section 3.2).\n Other recent efforts have tried to link traditions 1 and 3: Prakken\n(2005), for example, focuses on logical analysis in the context of\nlegal reasoning and non-monotonic reasoning; more recent and quite\ndifferent perspectives explore substructural approaches to paradoxes\nin terms of natural argumentation and its treatment in a\ngame-theoretical setting inspired by tradition 1 (French 2015; Dutilh\nNovaes & French 2018; Dutilh Novaes 2020). The present entry focuses on the original\nwork of Lorenzen and Lorenz (tradition 1) with its developments during\nthe last decades. Historical remarks on the relations between logic\nand dialogues can be found in\n the entry on logic and games,\n and in Lorenz (2001).\n\nSection 2\n presents the essential features of the standard dialogical framework,\nand how it can accommodate various logics.\n Section 3\n presents two variations on the standard framework: a first that\nendeavors to stay within tradition 1; a second that emancipates itself\nfrom tradition 1 while stressing the merits of such a dialogical\napproach for dealing with problems of philosophy of logic.\n2. The Standard Dialogical Framework of the Lorenzen and Lorenz Tradition\n\nAs hinted by its name, the dialogical framework studies dialogues; but\nit also takes the form of dialogues. In a dialogue, two parties\n(players) argue on a thesis (a certain statement that is the subject\nof the whole argument) and follow certain fixed rules in their\nargument. The player who states the thesis is the proponent, called\nP, and his rival, the player who challenges the\nthesis, is the opponent, called O. In challenging the\nproponent\u2019s thesis, the opponent is requiring that the proponent\ndefends his statement.\n\nThe two players are thus rivals during the play, they have opposing\ngoals, but the opposition does not necessarily have to go any further.\nIndeed, as spelled out by Marion (2006; 2009; 2010) and Keiff (2007),\nthe dialogues are a kind of \u201cgame of giving and asking for\nreasons\u201d (Brandom 1994, see also Sellars 1997), and this kind of\ngame can be for a common goal (e.g., figuring out the truth). There\ndoes not seem to be a consensus on whether the framework does allow\ncooperation or not. Some, like Dutilh Novaes (2015; 2020), have argued that\nthe original dialogical framework is only adversarial and does not\nconsider cooperation games. However, others have argued on the\ncontrary that even the original framework is actually not entirely\nadversarial: Hodges (2001), for example, considers that some attacks\nin these games actually amount to helping the adversary.\n\nActions in a dialogue are called moves; they are often understood as\nspeech-acts involving declarative utterances (statements) and\ninterrogative utterances (requests). The rules for dialogues thus\nnever deal with expressions isolated from the act of uttering them; by\ndefining the appropriate interactions in a dialogue, these rules\ndefine the meaning of the expressions. Such an approach to meaning\nfinds its roots in Wittgenstein\u2019s observation that in language,\nthere is no exterior perspective that would allow one to determine the\nmeaning of something and how it links to syntax. In other words,\nlanguage is unavoidable, one cannot go beyond it (this is\nWittgenstein\u2019s \u201cUnhintergehbarkeit der\nSprache\u201d). Accordingly, language is studied with and\nthrough language-games; these language-games need to acknowledge the\nfact that they are part of their object of study. In this respect, all\nthe speech-acts pertaining to the meaning and \u201cformation\u201d\nof an expression are made explicit in the dialogical framework. We are\nthus far from the metalinguistic perspective constitutive of the\nmodel-theoretic conceptions of meaning (see Lorenz 1970: 109; Sundholm\n1997; 2001).\n2.1 Intuitionistic logic in the standard dialogical framework\n\nThis section presents the general features of what may be called the\n\u201cstandard\u201d dialogical framework (as opposed to the more\nrecent developments presented in\n Section 3.2).\n\nThe word \u201cstandard\u201d here does not mean that the\npresentation below strictly follows in all its details the initial\npresentation of dialogical logic as introduced by Lorenzen and Lorenz.\nAs a matter of fact, there has been a lot of variations on terminology\nand presentation throughout the years (in the works of Felscher,\nKrabbe, Rahman, Ferm\u00fcller to mention but a few). Still, despite\nall the different variations in the literature, there are some\nfundamental features which this Section presents.\n\nAs mentioned above, the two players in a dialogue argue on a thesis\n(the statement that is the subject of the whole argument). They\nchallenge and defend statements according to rules, which spell out\nthe play\u2019s progress and the meaning of statements in terms of\npossible interaction between players. There are two kinds of game\nrules that need to be distinguished: particle rules\n(Partikelregeln) and structural rules\n(Rahmenregeln). Particle rules determine what kind of move\neach player is allowed to make during a play, whereas the structural\nrules determine the structure of the play: how it starts, ends, and\nwhat special rules apply to players. The game rules are detailed in\n Section 2.1.1.\n\nThe game rules (particle rules and structural rules) constitute what\nis called the play level of the dialogical\napproach\u2014constituting the backbone of dialogical logic in the\nLorenzen and Lorenz tradition\u2014which should be distinguished from\nthe strategy level, the dialogical counterpart to\ndemonstration (see\n Section 2.1.2).\n The play level is constituted by individual plays developed according\nto the game rules, whereas the strategy level consists in a certain\nperspective on all the possible plays regarding the same initial\nthesis. Validity belongs to the strategy level, but the meaning of\nstatements and determining what logic is currently being used both\nbelong to the play level through the game rules. Most non-dialogical\nframeworks focus on the level dealing with validity, and some\ndialogical ones also, following in this regard Felscher.\n\nThe constitutive role of the play level for developing a meaning\nexplanation has been stressed by Kuno Lorenz\u2019s definition of a\nproposition (Lorenz 2001: 258):\n\n\nfor an entity to be a proposition there must exist a dialogue game\nassociated with this entity, i.e., the proposition A, such\nthat an individual play of the game where A occupies the initial\nposition, i.e., a dialogue \\(D(A)\\) about A, reaches a final\nposition with either win or loss after a finite number of moves\naccording to definite rules: the dialogue game is defined as a\nfinitary open two-person zero-sum game. Thus, propositions will in\ngeneral be dialogue-definite, and only in special cases be either\nproof-definite or refutation-definite or even both which implies their\nbeing value-definite.\n\n\nHere, \u201cdefinite\u201d refers to Lorenzen\u2019s search for a\nconcept which is both characteristic of propositions and\ndecidable, which is one of the main reasons why he abandoned his\noperative logic and introduced dialogical logic (see Lorenz, 2001:\n257\u2013258). That a proposition is always\n\u201cdialogue-definite\u201d means that there is always a finite\ndialogue for this proposition ending with victory or loss for a\nplayer. On the other hand, a proposition is not in general\n\u201cproof-\u201d or \u201crefutation-definite\u201d since there\nis no decidable provability or unprovability predicate for arbitrary\npropositions.\n\nWinning and losing a play (play level) yields propositional content,\nwithout saying anything about the truth or falsity of the proposition.\nAn immediate consequence is that the dialogical notion of validity\n(strategy level) will not be defined truth-functionally (see\n Section 2.1.2).\n The dialogical perspective on propositions is that of the perspective\nof the inside (\u201clocal\u201d) view of the development of a\nplay.\n2.1.1 The rules of the game: the play level\n\nFor the remainder of this section, \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) is a first-order\nlanguage built as usual upon the propositional connectives, the\nquantifiers, a denumerable set of individual variables, a denumerable\nset of individual constants and a denumerable set of predicate symbols\n(each with a fixed arity). This first-order language is then extended\nwith two labels O and P, standing\nfor the players of the game, and the two symbols\n\u201c\\(\\state\\)\u201d and \u201c\\(\\rqst\\)\u201d standing\nrespectively for statements and requests.\n\nAs mentioned above, in the standard dialogical framework, there are\ntwo kinds of rules called the particle rules and the\nstructural rules, which will now be introduced. The rules of\nthe game determine which sequences of moves are\nplays\u2014i.e., which sequences are legal. Hence the name\n\u201cplay level\u201d for the level governed by these rules. First,\nthe particle rules will be presented and an example will be provided.\nThen, the structural rules will be presented and three examples will\nbe commented.\nParticle rules\n\nParticle rules (Partikelregeln), or rules for logical\nconstants, determine the legal moves in a play and regulate\ninteraction by establishing the relevant moves constituting\nchallenges and defences, depending on the main\nlogical constant in the expression at stake. The appropriate\nchallenges and defences (interaction) are the appropriate ways of\nasking for reasons and of giving them, and are specific to each kind\nof statement.\n\nFor instance, if the statement is a conjunction, there are two\nappropriate challenges, one for each conjunct, which consist in\nrequesting that the other player states the chosen conjunct. There is\none appropriate defence for each challenge, which consists in stating\nthe requested conjunct. The particle rules define both the meaning of\nconnectives and the statement based on its form. These particle rules\nexplicit the meaning of statements in terms of the players\u2019\nvarious commitments and entitlements regarding each\nstatement\u2014i.e., what moves are allowed.\n\nThese rules govern what is called the local level of meaning\n(distinguished from the global level provided by the structural\nrules): each kind of statement (e.g., conjunction, disjunction,\nuniversal quantification) receive its meaning through the appropriate\nchallenges and defences, which are spelled out by the particle rules.\nThus, the meaning of the statements are constituted in a dynamic way\nthrough the appropriate interaction during a dialogical game.\n\nAccordingly, the meaning of the statements in a dialogue does not lie\nin some external semantic, but is immanent to the dialogue itself,\ni.e., in the specific and appropriate way the players interact. (This\nis linked to the Wittgensteinian conception of meaning as use.) The\nrules are the same for the two players and the meaning of the\nconnectives is therefore independent of who uses them. This is why the\nrules are formulated using the variables \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) and\n\\(\\mathbf{Y}\\). Recall that the symbols \u201c!\u201d and\n\u201c?\u201d are used for statements and requests,\nrespectively.\n\nFor the benefit of those who are new to the dialogical framework, let\nus start with two particle rules, conjunction and implication.\n\nThe particle rules for a conjunction are the following: when a player\n\\(\\mathbf{X}\\) (either P or O)\nstates a conjunction, the other player \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) may challenge\nthe conjunction by choosing one of the conjuncts (the left one\n\\(L^{\\land}\\) or the right one \\(R^{\\land}\\)) and requesting it (? in\nfront of the chosen conjunct). The first player \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) defends\nthe conjunction by stating the requested conjunct.\n\n\n\nStatement\nChallenge\nDefence  \n\n\n\\(\\mathbf{X}\\ {\\state \\varphi\\land\\psi}\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{Y}\\ {\\rqst L^{\\land}}\\) or \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\ {\\rqst\nR^{\\land}}\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{X}\\ {\\state \\varphi}\\) respectively \\(\\mathbf{X}\\\n{\\state \\psi}\\)  \n\n\nThe particle rules for the implication are the following: when\n\\(\\mathbf{X}\\) states an implication, \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) may challenge it\nby stating the antecedent, and \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) defends it by stating\nthe consequent.\n\n\n\nStatement\nChallenge\nDefence  \n\n\n\\(\\mathbf{X}\\ {\\state \\varphi\\supset\\psi}\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{Y}\\ {\\state \\varphi}\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{X}\\ {\\state \\psi}\\)  \n\n\nHere is an example, which uses the structural rules that will be\npresented below. Let us consider propositional logic in this case. In\norder to build a play for \\(((p \\land q) \\supset p)\\), one must first\nset up a table which will record the moves (utterances) of each\nplayer, P and O, in their respective\ncolumns.\n\n\n\nO\nP  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\nAdd an outer column (A) in which the number of\nthe move will be recorded, and an inner column\n(B) in which the number of the challenged move will\nbe recorded.\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n\nO\nP\n\n\nmove\nstatement\nchallenge to move\nchallenge to move\nstatement\nmove  \n\n\nA\n\nB\nB\n\nA \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nNext, write the thesis, here \\(((p \\land q) \\supset p)\\), as\nthe first statement of the play, marked \u201c!\u201d and made by\nP. It is move 0, so 0 is written in the outer column\non P\u2019s side.\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\nO\nP \n\nmove\nstatement\nchallenge to move\nchallenge to move\nstatement\nmove  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\state((p\n\\land q) \\supset p)\\)\n0\n \n\n\nIt is now O\u2019s turn to play. She challenges the\nimplication. She must state the antecedent, here \\((p \\land q)\\). It\nis move 1 (outer column), and she challenges move 0 (inner\ncolumn).\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\nO\nP\n\n\nmove\nstatement\nchallenge to move\nchallenge to move\nstatement\nmove  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\state((p \\land q) \\supset\np)\\)\n0 \n\n1\n\\(\\state(p \\land\nq)\\)\n(0)\n\n\n  \n\n\nIt is now P\u2019s turn. He can either defend the\nchallenge on the implication, or challenge O\u2019s\nstatement (move 1). If he defends the implication, he must state the\nconsequent (here \\(p\\)). If he challenges the conjunction, he must\nchoose one of the conjuncts and request it.\n\nP challenges the conjunction (see below the\nFormal Rule SR2 \nwhich compels him to do so).

This move 2 is a challenge\non move 1 (inner column), and is a request (question mark before what\nis requested).\n\nIt is now O\u2019s turn. She must defend her\nconjunction (there is no other available move left) and state the\nrequested conjunct.

In the rules\nfor quantifiers, individual constants are numbered with an index \\(i\\)\nfrom the positive integers.\nSee below for examples of plays using these rules.\n\n\n\n\nStatement\nChallenge\nDefence  \n\n\nConjunction\n\\(\\mathbf{X}\\state \\varphi\\land\\psi\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{Y}\\rqst L^{\\land}\\) or \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\rqst\nR^{\\land}\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{X}\\state \\varphi\\) (resp.) \\(\\mathbf{X}\\state\n\\psi\\) \n\nDisjunction\n\\(\\mathbf{X}\\state \\varphi\\lor\\psi\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{Y}\\rqst_{\\lor}\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{X}\\state \\varphi\\) or \\(\\mathbf{X}\\state \\psi\\)\n\n\nImplication\n\\(\\mathbf{X}\\state \\varphi\\supset\\psi\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{Y}\\state \\varphi\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{X}\\state \\psi\\) \n\nNegation\n\\(\\mathbf{X}\\state \\neg\\varphi\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{Y}\\state \\varphi\\)\n\\(--\\) \n\nUniversal quantification\n\\(\\mathbf{X}\\state \\forall x\\varphi(x)\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{Y}\\rqst [x/a_{i}]\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{X}\\state \\varphi(x/a_{i})\\) \n\nExistential quantification\n\\(\\mathbf{X}\\state \\exists x\\varphi(x)\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{Y}\\rqst_{\\exists}\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{X}\\state \\varphi(x/a_{i})\\)  \n\n\nThe choices involved in the rules defining logical constants are\nimportant. The difference between a conjunction and a disjunction for\ninstance is that in the case of a conjunction, it is the challenger\nwho may choose the conjunct that will be defended, whereas in the case\nof a disjunction, it is the defender who may choose the disjunct. The\nnotion of choice has a similar importance for the meaning of the\nquantifiers. The meaning of logical constants, therefore, is not\ncaptured only in terms of which propositions are stated or requested:\nchoices are an essential part of the interaction process as they\ndetermine the local meaning of expressions.\nStructural rules\n\nStructural rules (Rahmenregeln) determine the general course\nof a dialogue game, such as how it is initiated, how to play it, how\nit ends, and so on. The point of these rules is not to spell\nout the meaning of the logical constants by specifying how to act in\nan appropriate way (this is the role of the particle rules); it is\nrather to specify the structure according to which interactions take\nplace. It is one thing to determine the meaning of the logical\nconstants as a set of appropriate challenges and defences (as above),\nit is another to define whose turn it is to play and when a player is\nallowed to play a move. One could indeed have the same local meaning\n(i.e., particle rules) and change a structural rule, saying for\ninstance that one of the players is allowed to play two moves at a\ntime instead of simply one: this would considerably change the game\nwithout changing the local meaning of what is said. This is actually\none of the main ways the dialogical framework can be used in order to\ndeal with other logical systems, and some examples are discussed in\n Section 2.2.\n\nIt should be noted that in some works\u2014e.g., S\u00f8rensen and\nUrzyczyn (2006); Dutilh Novaes and French (2018); Dutilh Novaes (2020); French\n(2021)\u2014game rules come from another framework such as sequent\ncalculus or a \u201csequent perspective on natural deduction\u201d\n(Dutilh Novaes & French 2018: 135). What is called\n\u201cstructural rules\u201d then refers to rules like weakening or\ncontraction. In this regard, these are rather variations on the\nstandard dialogical framework. See\n Section 3.3\n for an example of this kind.\n\nThere are four basic structural rules in the standard dialogical\nframework, defining which conditions must be respected for a given\nsequence of moves to constitute a legitimate play.\n\nSR0: Starting Rule A play starts with\nthe proponent stating a proposition called the thesis. After\nthe thesis has been stated, the opponent chooses a positive integer\nwhich will be her repetition rank during the play. Then the\nproponent chooses his own repetition rank.\n\n\nNotice that the identity of the players is established by this rule:\nP is the player who states the thesis, whereas\nO is the one who chooses her repetition rank first.\nAccording to a generalized version of this rule, a play may begin with\nthe opponent stating initial concessions before the thesis is stated.\nThis generalized version will be used in\n Section 3.2\n whereas, for the sake of simplicity,\n Section 2\n only considers the rule just presented.\n\nSR1i: Intuitionistic Game-playing Rule\nAfter the repetition ranks have been chosen, each move is a challenge\nor a defence in reaction to a previous move, in accordance with the\nparticle rules shown previously. Each player can challenge the same\nprevious move at most \\(\\mathtt{n}\\) times\u2014where \\(\\mathtt{n}\\)\nis the player\u2019s repetition rank\u2014or defend against the\nadversary\u2019s last unanswered challenge.\n\n\nThe repetition rank of the player applies to the number of challenges\nhe is able to make against a given statement of the adversary. As for\nthe number of defences he is able to make, the constraint is actually\nstronger: each challenge can be answered at most once, and only if it\nis the last unanswered challenge. This constraint is called the\nLast Duty First rule. See\n example 3, on the law of Excluded Third.\n\nRepetition ranks ensure that plays are finite. This allows defining a\nsimple winning condition for plays (see the Winning Rule). Different\npresentations of the framework have had different approaches of\nfiniteness of plays. Some like Krabbe (1985) have introduced other\nmeans to ensure it, while others like Felscher (1985) decided to allow\ninfinite plays (see also Hodges 2001 [2019 with\nV\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen]), often for the sake of generality. But it is\nclear from Lorenz\u2019s quote above that the framework originally\ndefines individual plays as finite. It should be noted that, because\nof how the\n Winning Rule SR3\n below defines victory, the fact that plays are always finite means\nthat victory in a play is decidable. However, it is well-known that\nfirst-order logic is undecidable. This immediately shows that the\nnotion of victory in a play is not the dialogical counterpart of\nvalidity.\n Section 2.1.2\n goes into further details on that topic.\n\nIt is worth noticing that the relation between repetition ranks and\nvictory is not as liberal as one may think at first. That is, victory\nwill not in general be ensured simply by choosing a large repetition\nrank in order to overcome the adversary with more repetitions. In the\ncase of challenges, a large repetition rank does little since the\nrepetition rank of the adversary applies to his defences against each\nparticular challenge. So if player \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) is able to answer a\nspecific challenge once, he will also be able to answer repetitions of\nthat same challenge. In the case of defences, a large repetition ranks\nalso does little because players have to answer to the last\nunanswered challenge. While there may be some special cases\nwhere the repetition rank has a slightly more significant influence on\nvictory, they are not the main factor. Clerbout (2014b) discusses the\nrelations between repetition ranks, victory, validity, and\ndecidability.\n\nSR2: Formal Rule (also known as Copy-Cat\nRule) P can play an atomic formula (e.g.,\n\\(\\Pa\\)) only if O has stated it previously in the\nplay.\n\n\nSR3: Winning Rule The play ends when it\nis a player\u2019s turn to make a move but he has no available move\nleft. That player loses and the other player wins.\n\n\nThe Formal Rule is often described as an essential aspect of the\ndialogical framework, and rightly so. It is, for example, one of the\nmost salient differences between the dialogical approach and\nHintikka\u2019s Game-Theoretical Semantics. Contrary to the other\nrules, the Formal Rule is not \u201canonymous\u201d: it does not\napply equally to both players since it puts a restriction on the moves\nthe proponent is allowed to play. Thus, the opponent is not concerned\nby exactly the same rules as the proponent.\n\nThe Formal Rule accounts for analyticity: the proponent, who brings\nthe thesis forward, will have to defend it without bringing any\nelementary statement (i.e., without introducing any new atomic\nformula) of his own in the play. His defence of the thesis will have\nto rely only on the elementary statements of the opponent. What is\nmore, everything the opponent states comes only from her challenges of\nthe proponent\u2019s statements (especially the thesis), so that the\nopponent\u2019s statements proceed from the meaning of the thesis\n(or, in some cases, her own initial concessions\u2014see\n Section 3.2\n for examples of dialogues with concessions).\n\nThis rule is also importantly connected to the topic of the dialogical\naccount of formality\n (Section 2.1.3)\n and, for that reason, to some critics against the framework on the\nrelation between formality and content which are discussed in\n Section 3.\n In the standard dialogical framework, the only elements whose meaning\nis left unspecified in formal plays are the elementary statements. The\nFormal Rule ensures that, in order to back the thesis, the proponent\nis not bringing in any elementary statement that the opponent might\nnot agree with: the proponent can only back his thesis with elementary\nstatements that the opponent herself has already stated. Recent\ndevelopments of the framework, as discussed in\n Section 3.2,\n allow the opponent to challenge elementary statements; the proponent\nthen needs to specify on what ground he makes this statement, thus\ngiving rise to material dialogues where the meaning of\nelementary statements is analysed more deeply than in the standard,\nformal dialogues.\n\nNote. It is possible to add rules for the\nIdentity predicate, but in general these are not included in works on\nthe standard dialogical framework. The reason for this is that no\nconsensus on the appropriate kind of rule can seem to be reached: should\nthere be special particle rules, thus fully embracing the idea that\nthis predicate is a logical constant of the vocabulary? or should\nthere be special clauses in the Formal Rule for this predicate because\nit is the rule that deals with elementary statements? Either way, the\nrules have the effect of capturing the reflexivity, transitivity, and\nsymmetry of the Identity predicate as well as the principle of\nsubstitution of identicals.\n\nHere is an example that liberalizes the Formal Rule so as to give\nspecial permissions to players when elementary statements involve the\n\\(\\Id\\) predicate. Each player is allowed to play \\(\\Id(c_i,c_i)\\).\nMoreover, each player is allowed to state \\(\\Id(c_j,c_i)\\) if\n\\(\\Id(c_i,c_j)\\) has been stated previously, as well as\n\\(\\Id(c_i,c_k)\\) if both \\(\\Id(c_i,c_j)\\) and \\(\\Id(c_j,c_k)\\) have\nbeen stated previously. Finally, if \\(\\Id(c_i,c_j)\\) and\n\\(\\varphi(c_i)\\) have been stated previously, they are allowed to\nstate \\(\\varphi(c_j)\\).\n\nAs a side note, the Immanent Reasoning framework presented in\n Section 3\n provides the means for delving into the meaning of the Identity\npredicate and distinguish it from other forms of equalities. It is not\npossible to give all the details in this entry, but some basic\nexplanations will be given together with the relevant\nbibliography.\nThree examples\n\nThree simple examples of plays will allow to see how the rules\noperate.\n\nExample 1.\n\nPlay for \\((\\Pa\\supset(\\Pa\\lor\\Qa))\\)\n\n\n\nMoves 0\u20132: in accordance with the\n Starting Rule SR0,\n the play starts with the proponent stating the thesis at move 0.

Because of the\n Formal Rule SR2,\n he is not allowed to choose \\(\\Qa\\) because the opponent has not\npreviously stated it. However, P is allowed to choose\n\\(\\Pa\\) because O stated it at move 3.\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\nO\nP\n\n\nmove\nstatement\nchallenge to move\nchallenge to move\nstatement\nmove  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\state\n(\\Pa\\supset(\\Pa\\lor{}\\Qa))\\)\n0 \n\n1\n\\(\\mathtt{n} :=\\rank{1}\\)\n\n\n\\(\\mathtt{m}:=\\rank{1}\\)\n2 \n\n3\n\\(\\state \\Pa\\)\n(0)\n\n\\(\\state (\\Pa\\lor{}\\Qa)\\)\n4 \n\n5\n\\(\\rqst_{\\lor}\\)\n(4)\n\n\\(\\state \\Pa\\)\n6 \n\nP wins\nthe play.  \n \n\n\nThe opponent has no further possible move. Because her repetition rank\nis \\(\\rank{1}\\), she cannot challenge again the proponent\u2019s\nmove, as established in the \n Game-playing Rule SR1i. \nNotice that moves\n3 to 6 follow the rule SR1i: after the repetition ranks have been\nchosen, each move is a challenge or a defence in reaction to a\nprevious move. Since O cannot make any move after\nmove 6, the proponent wins the play according to the\n Winning Rule SR3.\n\n\nExample 2.\n\nThe next example involves a quantifier: \\((\\forall\nxPx\\supset{}\\Pa)\\)\n\nThis example illustrates the importance of keeping track of the order\nof the moves (outer columns).\n\n\n\nMoves 0\u20133: similarly to the previous example,\nthe play starts with P stating the thesis and both\nplayers choosing their repetition ranks, in accordance with\n SR0.\n Then O challenges the thesis at move 3 by stating\nthe antecedent while applying the particle rule for the material\nimplication.\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\nO\nP\n\n\nmove\nstatement\nchallenge to move\nchallenge to move\nstatement\nmove  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\state (\\forall\nxPx\\supset{}\\Pa)\\)\n0 \n\n1\n\\(\\mathtt{n} :=\\rank{1}\\)\n\n\n\\(\\mathtt{m}:=\\rank{1}\\)\n2 \n\n3\n\\(\\state \\forall\nxPx\\)\n(0)\n\n\n  \n \n\n\nMove 4: in order to defend himself, the proponent\nwould need to play an elementary statement which has not yet been\nstated by the opponent. Because of the \n Formal Rule, this is not\nallowed. But there is something else the proponent can do: he can\nchallenge the statement O made at move 3.\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\nO\nP\n\n\nmove\nstatement\nchallenge to move\nchallenge to move\nstatement\nmove  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\state (\\forall\nxPx\\supset{}\\Pa)\\)\n0 \n\n1\n\\(\\mathtt{n} :=\\rank{1}\\)\n\n\n\\(\\mathtt{m}:=\\rank{1}\\)\n2 \n\n3\n\\(\\state \\forall\nxPx\\)\n(0)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n(3)\n\\(\\rqst [x/a]\\)\n4  \n\n\nNote that move 4 does not appear in front of move 3 since it is\nnot a defence against that move: it is a new challenge. With his\nchallenge, the proponent applies the particle rule for universal\nquantification and chooses the individual constant \\(a\\).\n\n\n\nMoves 5\u20136: O defends her\nuniversal quantification by instanciating her statement with\nP\u2019s choice of instance (see the\nparticle rule).\nBy doing so, she states the elementary statement that the proponent\nneeded in order to answer to move 3: he does so with move 6, which is\nwritten in front of the corresponding challenge.

There is nothing P can challenge, since\nO\u2019s only statement is elementary. He loses the\nplay.\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\nO\nP\n\n\nmove\nstatement\nchallenge to move\nchallenge to move\nstatement\nmove  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\state \\Pa\\lor\\neg{}\\Pa\\)\n0 \n\n1\n\\(\\mathtt{n} :=\\rank{1}\\)\n\n\n\\(\\mathtt{m}:=\\rank{2}\\)\n2 \n\n3\n\\(\\rqst_{\\lor}\\)\n(0)\n\n\\(\\state \\neg{}\\Pa\\)\n4 \n\n5\n\\(\\state \\Pa\\)\n(4)\n\n\n \n\nO wins\nthe play.  \n \n\n\nWhat about answering a second time to the opponent\u2019s move 3?\nEven though his repetition rank is \\(\\rank{2}\\) and the opponent\nstated \\(\\Pa\\) at move 5, the proponent cannot answer a second time to\nmove 3 by choosing the first disjunct. This is because move 3 is no\nlonger the last unanswered challenge made by the opponent: at this\npoint, move 5 is the last one. Thus, the proponent has no further\npossible move and he loses the play. Notice that, unlike the\nproof-theoretic account of intuitionistic logic, the meaning of the\nExcluded Third does not amount to knowing what could count as having a\nproof of it but to the fact that it can constitute the thesis of a\nplay that ends with one of the players winning or losing. The\nproof-theoretic account of knowing what counts as having a proof\nmanifests itself, in a dialogical setting, in terms of having a\nwinning strategy. See\n Section 2.2.1\n for classical dialogical games which have rules that allow\nP to win.\n\n2.1.2 The strategy level\n\nThe level of strategies is the level at which one can study games in\nterms of collections of plays rather than staying at the level of\nindividual plays. There may be various reasons to do so. The main\nreason is that one may thus determine whether a player can win no matter\nhow his adversary would play, and not just whether that player happens\nto win a particular play. This distinction is important for validity.\nTo understand the distinction, consider first the following play:\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\nO\nP\n\n\nmove\nstatement\nchallenge to move\nchallenge to move\nstatement\nmove  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\state\n(\\Pa\\land(\\Pa\\supset{}\\Pa))\\)\n0 \n\n1\n\\(\\mathtt{n} :=\\rank{1}\\)\n\n\n\\(\\mathtt{m}:=\\rank{1}\\)\n2 \n\n3\n\\(\\rqst R^{\\land}\\)\n(0)\n\n\\(\\state\n(\\Pa\\supset{}\\Pa)\\)\n4 \n\n5\n\\(\\state \\Pa\\)\n(4)\n\n\\(\\state \\Pa\\)\n6 \n\nP wins\nthe play.  \n\n\nExplanations\n\n\n\nMoves 0\u20133: P states the thesis\nand the players choose their repetition rank. O\nchallenges the thesis, which is a conjunction, by requesting the right\nconjunct. \n\n\nMoves 4\u20136: P states the right\nconjunct, it is an implication. O challenges it by\nstating the antecedent, and P defends it by stating\nthe consequent. \n\n\nThe proponent wins this play. But one may wonder if there is not\nsomething that the opponent could do in order to win. In fact, this\nquestion arises quite naturally if one is curious about the\nrelationship between winning a play and proving the validity of a\nthesis in a dialogical setting. In the play above, the proponent\nhappens to win a play for a formula that is clearly not valid. Now, it\nis quite easy to see that, in fact, the opponent had a way to win by\nmaking another choice at move 3:\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\nO\nP\n\n\nmove\nstatement\nchallenge to move\nchallenge to move\nstatement\nmove  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\state\n(\\Pa\\land(\\Pa\\supset{}\\Pa))\\)\n0 \n\n1\n\\(\\mathtt{n} :=\\rank{1}\\)\n\n\n\\(\\mathtt{m}:=\\rank{1}\\)\n2 \n\n3\n\\(\\rqst\nL^{\\land}\\)\n(0)\n\n\n \n\nO wins\nthe play.  \n\n\nIn this play, the opponent chooses the left part of the conjunction\nwhen challenging the thesis. In order to defend, the proponent must\nbring forward an elementary statement. But since the opponent has not\nstated it previously, the Formal Rule prevents the proponent from\ndefending the thesis. Since the proponent has no other available move,\nhe loses the play, as established by the\n Winning Rule (SR3).\n\nThus, it is possible for the proponent to win merely because the\nopponent has played poorly.

But at move 4 the proponent was\nable to choose which disjunct to state in order to defend.

There are various equivalent ways to define\nstrategies, though in the Lorenzen and Lorenz tradition, winning\nstrategies can be built from plays through a procedure that allows to\ncheck if every possible choice of P has been taken\ninto account. However, in the context of results connecting the\ndialogical framework with other frameworks, it is useful and quite\ncommon to identify strategies with their extensive forms. Here are the\nrelevant definitions.\n\nSimply put, a strategy for player \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) in a\ndialogical game is a complete conditional plan of action. It is\nconditional in the sense that the strategy informs how \\(\\mathbf{X}\\)\nplays depending on the moves of the adversary. It is complete in the\nsense that it must inform how \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) plays for every possible\nchoice of move by the adversary. Given a formula \\(\\varphi\\), a\nstrategy for \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) in the game for \\(\\varphi\\) can be\ndescribed as a function that assigns an \\(\\mathbf{X}\\)-move \\(M\\) to\nevery non-terminal play \\(\\Delta\\) ending with a \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\)-move\nsuch that extending \\(\\Delta\\) with \\(M\\) results in a play for\n\\(\\varphi\\). Such a strategy is winning if all terminal plays\nresulting from it are \\(\\mathbf{X}\\)-terminal (i.e., won by\n\\(\\mathbf{X}\\)). In other words, a winning strategy for a player is a\ncomplete conditional plan of action leading to the player\u2019s\nvictory no matter how the adversary plays.\n\nThe extensive form of a dialogical game\n\\(\\mathcal{D}(\\varphi)\\) for \\(\\varphi\\) is simply the tree\nrepresentation of the game, where each path represents a play and\nbranches represent terminal plays. Thus, the extensive form\n\\(\\mathfrak{E}_{\\varphi}\\) of \\(\\mathcal{D}(\\varphi)\\) is the tree\n(\\(T\\), \\(\\ell\\), \\(S\\)) such that:\n\nEvery node \\(t\\in{}T\\) is labelled with a move \\(M\\) in\n\\(\\mathcal{D}(\\varphi)\\)\n\\(\\ell: T\\longrightarrow\\mathbb{N}\\)\n\\(S\\subseteq{}T^{2}\\) such that:\n\n\nThere is a unique \\(t_{0}\\in{}T\\) labelled with the thesis of\n\\(\\mathcal{D}(\\varphi)\\) and such that \\(\\ell(t_{0})=0\\),\nFor every \\(t\\neq{}t_{0}\\) there is a unique \\(t'\\) such that\n\\(t'St\\),\nFor every \\(t\\), \\(t'\\in{}T\\), if \\(tSt'\\) then\n\\(\\ell(t')=\\ell(t)+1\\),\nFor every play \\(\\Delta\\in\\mathcal{D}(\\varphi)\\), if move \\(M'\\)\nimmediately follows move \\(M\\) in \\(\\Delta\\) then there are nodes\n\\(t\\) and \\(t'\\) in \\(T\\) such that \\(\\ell(t')=\\ell(t)+1\\), \\(t\\) is\nlabelled with \\(M\\) and \\(t'\\) is labelled with \\(M'\\).\n \n\n\nBeing identified with its extensive form, a strategy for player\n\\(\\mathbf{X}\\) in \\(\\mathcal{D}(\\varphi)\\) is the fragment \\(S_{x}\\)\nof \\(\\mathfrak{E}_{\\varphi}\\) such that each path in \\(S_{x}\\)\nrepresents a play resulting from the \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) strategy. In other\nwords: (i) for every node \\(t\\) in \\(\\mathfrak{E}_{\\varphi}\\) labelled\nwith an \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) move, every successor of \\(t\\) in\n\\(\\mathfrak{E}_{\\varphi}\\) appears in \\(S_{x}\\) whenever \\(t\\) is in\n\\(S_{x}\\); and (ii) for every node \\(t\\) in \\(\\mathfrak{E}_{\\varphi}\\)\nlabelled with a \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) move, if there is at least a successor\nfor \\(t\\) in \\(\\mathfrak{E}_{\\varphi}\\) then there is a unique \\(t'\\)\nlabelled with an \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) move such that \\(t'\\) is the successor\nof \\(t\\) in \\(S_{x}\\) and \\(t'\\) is the move prescribed by the\nstrategy. Thus, in an \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) strategy the ramifications\ncorresponding to \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) having multiple choices are not kept\n(since a given strategy selects one \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) move) but\nthe ones corresponding to \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\)\u2019s choices are kept\n(since the strategy must consider all possible moves of\n\\(\\mathbf{Y}\\)).\n\nHere are some examples of results which pertain to the level of\nstrategies. For details on the proofs of most of these results, see\nClerbout (2014a):\n\n\n\nWinning P strategies and leaves. Let \\(S_{p}\\) be a\nwinning P strategy in the game for \\(\\varphi\\). Then\nevery leaf in \\(S_{p}\\) is labelled with a P\nelementary statement. \n\n\nDeterminacy. There is a winning \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) strategy in the game\nfor \\(\\varphi\\) if and only if there is no winning \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\)\nstrategy in this game. \n\n\nSoundness/Completeness of Tableaux. Felscher (1985) showed that there\nis a tableau proof for \\(\\varphi\\) if and only if there is a winning\nP strategy in the intuitionistic dialogical game for\n\\(\\varphi\\). This being the first correct and complete proof, it is\nvery influential in some dialogical traditions, despite the fact that\nFelscher\u2019s rules do not guarantee finiteness of plays.\n\nClerbout (2014a) showed that tableaux for classical logic (Smullyan\n1968) are sound and complete for classical dialogical games as defined\nin\n Section 2.2.1,\n i.e., with repetition ranks. By soundness and completeness of the\ntableau method with respect to model-theoretic semantics, it follows\nthat existence of a winning P strategy coincides with\nvalidity: There is a winning P strategy in the game\nfor \\(\\varphi\\) if and only if \\(\\varphi\\) is valid.\n\nThe correspondence between the dialogical approach and other\nframeworks such as tableaux is to be found at the level of strategies,\nand more precisely of strategies for the proponent. So, from the\ndialogical point of view, tableaux rules are limited to how (particle)\nrules are applied in the context of a P-strategy;\nthey are thus insensitive to the play level (where semantics is\ndefined in terms of interaction). In fact, in the demonstration of the\nequivalence it is made clear how transforming a winning\nP-strategy into a tableau proof supposes getting rid\nof most elements constitutive of interaction (such as most challenges)\nuntil the player labels O and P\nbecome nothing more than an alternative way of writing the usual\ntableau signatures \\(T\\) and \\(F\\). \n\n2.1.3 Formality\n\nAs pointed out when presenting the structural rule in\n Section 2.1.1,\n the \n Formal Rule\nis one of the most salient features of the dialogical\nframework. With this rule the dialogical approach comes with an\ninternal account of elementary propositions in terms of interaction\nonly, without depending on metalogical meaning explanations for the\nnon-logical vocabulary. More prominently, this means that the\ndialogical account does not rely\u2014contrary to Hintikka\u2019s\nGTS games\u2014on the model-theoretic approach to meaning for\nelementary propositions. Hence, just as Lorenz (2001) clearly stated,\nthe dialogical notion of proposition does not assume truth-conditional\nsemantics.\n\nJust like the particle rules for logical constants, the Formal Rule\nsets the meaning of elementary statements purely in terms of\ndialogical interaction. This has clear roots in the Ancient Greek\ntradition of logic, most particularly in Plato and Aristotle. Lorenzen\nalluded to Greek dialectics in his 1960 paper. On this matter, Marion\nand R\u00fcckert (2016) discuss how the dialogical framework can\ndirectly be related with this Platonist and Aristotelian conception.\nPlato\u2019s Gorgias (472b\u2013c), for example, expresses\nan idea which can be freely summed up with the following\nstatement:\n\n\nthere is no better grounding of an assertion within an argument\nthan indicating that it has already been conceded by the opponent or\nthat it follows from these concessions.\n\n\nThe dialogical account of formality is rooted in this idea.\nIndeed:\n\nformality is understood as a kind of interaction;\nand\nformal reasoning should not be understood as devoid of\ncontent and reduced to purely syntactic moves.\n\n\nIn the case of the\n Formal Rule\n seen in\n Section 2.1.1,\n point 1 is clearly accounted for. Point 2, however, is maybe less\nobvious and some objections against the dialogical framework are\ndirectly related to the topic on content. These objections are\nsometimes collectively referred to as \u201cthe content\nchallenge\u201d (see\n Section 3.1).\n Indeed, in the standard dialogical framework there is no way of\nasking for reasons for elementary statements and giving them: in this\nsense, the form of interaction differs notably from the one defined\nfor statements having logical constants. As a consequence, some\ninterpretations of standard dialogical logic did understand plays in a\npurely syntactic manner. Thus, the standard formulation seems\nparticularly prone to the frequent criticism against formal reasoning\nand logic according to which they are reduced to syntactic\nmanipulation devoid of content. Various answers have been provided,\nsee\n Section 3.\n2.2 Other logics in the dialogical framework: dialogical pluralism\n\nIn the 1990s and the 2000s, the original ideas of the dialogical\napproach were developed by Shahid Rahman and collaborators into a\nconceptual framework that proved useful for studying, comparing and\neven combining non-classical logics (R\u00fcckert 2011). These\ndevelopments led to dialogical pluralism (see in particular\nRahman & Keiff 2005 and Keiff 2007). In a nutshell, this pluralism\nstudies the semantic and logical consequences of modifying the\nstructural rules or extending the set of logical constants. The\ngeneral idea is that different logics involve different ways to deal\nwith information in (sub)plays (a subplay is simply a sequence of\nmoves within a play; this notion is particularly useful when comparing\nplays which have a common initial segment but differ in two different\nsubplays resulting from a player\u2019s choice). The task is then to\ndetermine what information gets transferred from one play to another\nand how this transfer operates. Two general cases may be\ndistinguished:\n\n\n\nThe information-transfer is regulated by means of specific structural\nrules (global level); in some cases, however, these additional rules\ncan be prompted by operators.\n\nExample 1: in classical logic the specific structural rule is not\nrelated to special additional operators. Example 2: modal logics are a\ncase where the specific structural rules are related to the modal\noperators whose local meaning gets defined by particle rules.\n\n\n\nThe information-transfer is already regulated with the particle rules\nfor special operators (local level).\n\nExample: the dialogical approach to linear logic. This is\nGirard\u2019s point in distinguishing additives from multiplicatives,\nas they should not (as in the standard approach to modal logic) be\ndefined through structural rules (global level) but through particle\nrules (local level) as two different connectives (or operators) of\ninteraction. \n\n\nThis section presents with more details the examples of classical and\nbasic modal logics within the dialogical framework. The section ends\nwith some literature relevant to the dialogical approaches of various\nlogics and to dialogical pluralism.\n2.2.1 Dialogues for classical first-order logic\n\nSection 2.1\n presented the dialogical framework for intuitionistic logic.\nClassical logic results when a structural rule is modified: the\n Game-playing Rule SR1. \nIn the dialogical setting, the logical\nconstants have the same local meaning, which manifests itself by the\nfact that the particle rules are the same. The difference between\nclassical and intuitionistic logic appears as a difference in the\nstructural rules (namely in SR1). Structural rules are mainly\nprocedural rules for the development of a dialogue and, although these\nprocedural rules may have an effect on how the local meaning\nof logical constants is implemented in the course of a play,\nthis does not amount to a change in the local meaning of the logical\nconstants. In other words, the development of a play, for both\nintuitionistic and classical logic, assumes that the interaction\nfollows the same particle rules (local meaning) for the logical\nconstants.\n\nFor Classical dialogical games, the following structural rule\n SR1c\n replaces\n SR1i\n provided in\n Section 2.1.1.\n\nSR1c: Classical Game-playing Rule After\nrepetition ranks have been chosen, each move is a challenge or a\ndefence in reaction to a previous move, in accordance with the\nparticle rules shown previously. Each player can challenge the\nsame previous move, or defend against the same previous challenge, at\nmost n times, where n is that player\u2019s\nrepetition rank.\n\n\nThis rule is a liberalized version of the\n Intuitionistic Game-Playing Rule\n insofar as the Last Duty First constraint disappears. The\nrest of the rule is identical to the rule from the previous Section.\nAs a result of the liberalization, information that would maybe not be\navailable to players in some subplays in intuitionistic dialogical\ngames (due to the intuitionistic constraint) becomes available. Thus,\nclassical logic results from allowing more information to be available\nbetween different parts of a play. Notice that this availability of\ninformation does not suppose changing to a truth-functional concept of\nproposition: the dialogical definition of proposition remains\nunchanged since availability of elementary statements in an\nargumentative debate does not commit to their being true.\n\nTo see the difference with intuitionistic dialogical games, consider\nthe following example. This is a play for a thesis we have seen at the\nend of\n Section 2.1.1,\n but played this time with the\n Classical Game-Playing Rule (SR1c).\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\nO\nP\n\n\nmove\nstatement\nchallenge to move\nchallenge to move\nstatement\nmove  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\state \\Pa\\lor\\neg{}\\Pa\\)\n0 \n\n1\n\\(\\mathtt{n} :=\\rank{1}\\)\n\n\n\\(\\mathtt{m}:=\\rank{2}\\)\n2 \n\n3\n\\(\\rqst_{\\lor}\\)\n(0)\n\n\\(\\state \\neg{}\\Pa\\)\n4 \n\n5\n\\(\\state \\Pa\\)\n(4)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\state \\Pa\\)\n6 \n\nP wins\nthe play.  \n\n\nExplanations\n\n\n\nMoves 0\u20135: the play develops exactly as in the\nintuitionistic dialogical game for the same thesis. \n\n\nMove 6: This time, the proponent is not restricted by\nthe \n Last Duty First SR1i rule. \nSince his repetition rank is\n\\(\\rank{2}\\), he is allowed to answer a second time to the\nopponent\u2019s challenge made at move 3. And since\nO played the elementary statement \\(\\Pa\\) at move 5,\nP is able to choose it and play it at move 6. The\nopponent has no other possible move and the proponent wins this\nplay. \n\n2.2.2 Dialogues for basic modal logic\n\nIn the case of modal logic, the information transfer between subplays\nis regulated by structural rules which are related to the modal\noperators, introduced in the object-language, which get their local\nmeaning through corresponding particle rules. This is the general\ndialogical tenet on modal logic. The differences between distinct\nnormal modal systems (such as K, T,\nB, etc.) manifest as differences in the dedicated\nstructural rules while the local meaning of the operators remains\nunchanged.\n\nThe case of modal logics is probably one in which the process of\ndistinguishing between subplays is made the most explicit. The idea of\nthe dialogical approach to modal logics is to add a further element to\nthe information about moves: in addition to the player who performs\nthe move, and the nature of the move (statement or request), each move\ncomes with a label indicating in which dialogical context it is\nperformed. The particle rules for modal operators define how changes\nof dialogical contexts are triggered. The result is the generation of\ndifferent subplays which are distinguished by the dialogical contexts\nassigned to them. Accordingly, and given the usual definition of the\nbasic modal language, the particle rules are:\n\n\n\n\nStatement\nChallenge\nDefence  \n\n\nConjunction\n\\(\\mathbf{X}\\state A\\land{}B - c_{i}\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{Y}\\rqst L^{\\land} - c_{i}\\) or \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\rqst\nR^{\\land} - c_{i}\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{X}\\state A - c_{i}\\) (resp.) \\(\\mathbf{X}\\state B -\nc_{i}\\) \n\nDisjunction\n\\(\\mathbf{X}\\state A\\lor{}B - c_{i}\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{Y}\\rqst_{\\lor} - c_{i}\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{X}\\state A - c_{i}\\) or \\(\\mathbf{X}\\state B -\nc_{i}\\) \n\nImplication\n\\(\\mathbf{X}\\state A\\supset{}B - c_{i}\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{Y}\\state A - c_{i}\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{X}\\state B - c_{i}\\) \n\nNegation\n\\(\\mathbf{X}\\state \\neg{}A - c_{i}\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{Y}\\state A - c_{i}\\)\n\\(--\\) \n\nNecessity operator\n\\(\\mathbf{X}\\state \\square A - c_{i}\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{Y}\\rqst [c_{j}/c_{i}]\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{X}\\state A - c_{j}\\) \n\nPossibility operator\n\\(\\mathbf{X}\\state \\lozenge A - c_{i}\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{Y}\\rqst_{\\lozenge}\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{X}\\state A - c_{j}\\)  \n\n\nThe particle rules for propositional connectives are like those in\n Section 2.1.1,\n with an additional indication concerning the dialogical context\n(denoted \\(c_{i}\\)), which, however, does not modify the current\ncontext. Propositional connectives are thus unlike unary connectives\nsuch as modal operators, which provoke a dialogical context change\naccording to the particle rules. In this regard, the only difference\nbetween the possibility operator and the necessity operator pertains\nto which player may choose the new context (in the rule for the\nnecessity operator, \u201c\\(c_{j}/c_{i}\\)\u201d is read as the\nrequest to substitute \\(c_j\\) for \\(c_i\\)). This point illustrates\nonce again the key role of choice in the dialogical approach to\nmeaning built through the game rules.\n\nThis integration of the \u201clocal\u201d perspective of the\nplayers into the framework is an important proposal. Dialogical\ncontexts are labels used to identify different parts (subplays) of a\ngiven dialogue and thus keep track of the information flow between\nthese parts. This can be seen as a step towards hybridation\n(having syntactical tools to name states or worlds). Patrick Blackburn\n(2001) argued, however, that a thorough discussion of the benefits of\nsuch an integration advocates for a complete hybridation and that the\nidea behind dialogical modal logics should be pursued to its fullest.\nThus, from a model-theoretic perspective, dialogical contexts will\ncorrespond to (names of) possible worlds. But one important difference\nis that in the dialogical framework the contexts are explicitly part\nof the players\u2019 interaction through particle rules and through\nthe special structural rule introduced below.\n\nThe way information is transferred from one subplay to another is\nmanaged at the level of structural rules, which need to be updated in\norder to account for the presence of dialogical contexts in the moves.\nThe rules seen in\n Section 2.1.1\n remain, although relativized to dialogical contexts. An additional\nspecial rule is added about context changes.\n\n\n\nSR0: Starting Rule A play starts with the proponent\nP stating a proposition, called the thesis, at\ncontext \\(c_{1}\\).\n\nAfter the thesis has been stated, the opponent O\nchooses a positive integer which will be her repetition rank during\nthe play. Then the proponent P chooses his own\nrepetition rank. Repetition ranks are chosen at context\n\\(c_{1}\\). \n\n\nSR1: Game-playing Rule After repetition\nranks have been chosen, each move is a challenge or a defence in\nreaction to a previous move, in accordance with the particle rules.\nEach player can challenge the same previous move, or defend against\nthe same previous challenge, at most n times, where\nn is that player\u2019s repetition rank.\n\n\nNotice that it is possible to play with the intuitionistic version of\nthis rule and, thus, to combine aspects from intuitionistic dialogical\nlogic and modal dialogical logic.\n\nSR2: Formal Rule (also known as Copy-Cat\nRule) P can state an elementary statement\nat some context \\(c_{i}\\) only if O stated\nit beforehand in the play at this context \\(c_{i}\\).\n\n\nThis relativization of the Formal Rule to contexts is an essential\npart of the dialogical approach to modal logic. Close attention should\nbe paid to how information is transferred between subplays: it is\ncrucial to know clearly what elementary statements P\nis allowed to make at any given context.\n\nSR3: Winning Rule The play ends\nwhen it is a player\u2019s turn to make a move but he has no\navailable move left. That player loses and the other player wins.\n\n\nIn addition to these familiar rules, an extra rule is needed to give\nan account of how new contexts may be generated by means of the\nparticle rules for modal operators. This, combined with the Formal\nRule relativized to dialogical contexts, is the way in which the\ntransfer of information is regulated in dialogical games for modal\nlogics.\n\nDifferent constraints on the transfer of information (that is to say,\nultimately, on the generation of new contexts) mean different possible\nversions of a rule regulating it. A first example is the following\none:\n\nSRK: K-availability of contexts Whenever\nhe is to choose a context when applying the particle rule of a modal\noperator, P can choose context \\(c_{j}\\) at \\(c_{i}\\)\nonly if O chose \\(c_{j}\\) at \\(c_{i}\\)\nbeforehand.\n\n\nLike the Formal Rule, this rule is asymmetrical: it puts restrictions\non the proponent\u2019s ability to choose new contexts. Both rules\nspecify how information\u2014about elementary statements or\ncontexts\u2014becomes available to P only if\nO has previously provided it.\n\nThis structural rule SRK embodies the dialogical definition of the\nmodal system K. Various versions of this rule can be\nused to account for other (normal) modal systems. In this fashion, the\n(normal) modal systems\u2019 differences are manifested in the\ndialogical approach through different constraints on context\ninformation available to P (Rahman & Keiff 2005).\nHere is an example of a play resulting from the rules seen so far\n(i.e., with SRK):\n\n  \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\nO\nP\n\n\nmove\ncontext\nstatement\nchallenge to move\nchallenge to move\nstatement\ncontext\nmove  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\state\n\\square(p\\supset{}q)\\supset(\\square{}p\\supset\\square{}q)\\)\n\\(c_{1}\\)\n0 \n\n1\n\\(c_{1}\\)\n\\(\\mathtt{n} :=\\rank{1}\\)\n\n\n\\(\\mathtt{m}:=\\rank{2}\\)\n\\(c_{1}\\)\n2 \n\n3\n\\(c_{1}\\)\n\\(\\state\n\\square(p\\supset{}q)\\)\n(0)\n\n\\(\\state\n\\square{}p\\supset\\square{}q\\)\n\\(c_{1}\\)\n4 \n\n5\n\\(c_{1}\\)\n\\(\\state \\square{}p\\)\n(4)\n\n\\(\\state \\square{}q\\)\n\\(c_{1}\\)\n6 \n\n7\n\\(c_{1}\\)\n\\(\\rqst [c_{2}/c_{1}]\\)\n(6)\n\n\\(\\state q\\)\n\\(c_{2}\\)\n14 \n\n9\n\\(c_{2}\\)\n\\(\\state p\\supset{}q\\)\n\n(3)\n\\(\\rqst [c_{2}/c_{1}]\\)\n\\(c_{1}\\)\n8 \n\n11\n\\(c_{2}\\)\n\\(\\state p\\)\n\n(5)\n\\(\\rqst [c_{2}/c_{1}]\\)\n\\(c_{1}\\)\n10 \n\n13\n\\(c_{2}\\)\n\\(\\state q\\)\n\n(9)\n\\(\\state p\\)\n\\(c_{2}\\)\n12 \n\nP wins\nthe play.  \n\n\nThe constraints on contexts available to P can be\nmade stronger or weaker, as the following rules for other well-known\nmodal systems illustrate.

Helge\nR\u00fcckert\u2019s book includes a dialogical approach to\nmultivalued logics, which is a topic that has been studied in a\ndifferent way by Ferm\u00fcller (2008) and Ferm\u00fcller and Roschger\n(2014). An important development on the relations between dialogical\nlogic and constructive mathematics was made in Coquand (1995). Keiff\n(2004) and Keiff (2007) are other works on the dialogical approach to\nmodal logic. Fiutek et al. (2010) studied the dialogical approach to\nbelief revision. The framework has been used to propose fruitful\nreconstructions of various logical traditions such as, among others,\nmedieval obligationes (Dutilh Novaes 2007; Popek 2012), Jain\nlogic (Clerbout et al. 2011), or Aristotle\u2019s syllogistic\n(Crubellier et al. 2019). Redmond (2011) developed a dialogical\napproach to fiction, building on previous works on free logics. The\nbook of Fontaine (2013) deals with intentionality, fiction and\ndialogues, the book of Magnier (2013) deals with dynamic epistemic\nlogic and legal reasoning in a dialogical framework, while the work of\nShafiei (2018) gives dialogical foundations to the phenomenological\napproach to meaning, intentionality, and reasoning.\n\nA different take on dialogical pluralism is hinted at by Dutilh Novaes\nand French (2018), Dutilh Novaes (2020), and French (2021), in which pluralism stems from the\ndialogical reading of the structural rules of sequent calculus or\nnatural deduction. An important recent work on the relations between\nsequent calculus and the dialogical approach is Ferm\u00fcller\n(2021).\n3. Variations on the Standard Dialogical Framework\n\nThe previous section presented the standard dialogical framework in\nthe Lorenzen and Lorenz tradition. Different logics can be expressed\nwithin this framework, they can thus also be compared (e.g., classical\nand intuitionistic logic, and modal logics). Different objections have\nbeen raised against the standard framework, as the three objections\npresented below attest; various answers have been given by logicians\ninterested in the dialogical perspective, often abandoning the\nLorenzen and Lorenz tradition 1 in order to build a framework most\nappropriate to their own purposes (for other objections and their answer, see R\u00fcckert 2001).\n\nIn this section two variations of the standard framework are briefly\nconsidered, with their answers to objections made to the standard\nframework: the Immanent Reasoning framework maintains itself in the\ninitial tradition, whereas the Built-In Opponent (BIO) framework\ndistances itself from the standard approach.\n3.1 Objections against the standard dialogical framework\n\nThe standard dialogical framework is too formal. A\nrecurrent objection made to the standard dialogical framework is that\nit is too formal, in the sense that the dialogues in this\n\u201cdialogical\u201d logic are not real dialogues, with actual\ncontent, they only deal with the logical constants. See for instance\nHintikka (1973: 77\u201382), Peregrin (2014: 100, 106), Trafford\n(2017: 86\u201388), and Dutilh Novaes and French (2018: 131).\n\nAt least two options adopted provide an answer to this objection: one,\nwhich is not in the Lorenzen and Lorenz tradition, consists in linking\ndialogues with empirical social interaction in line with argumentation\ntheory (Barth & Krabbe 1982; Gethmann 1979, for example); the\nother intends to stay in the Lorenzen and Lorenz tradition and go all\nthe way with dialogues, which supposes providing content through\ndialogical means. The Immanent Reasoning framework\u2019s\nmaterial dialogues is a proposal to deal with this contentual\naspect, especially regarding elementary propositions. Such a project\nis consistent with the work of Lorenz (1970; 2009; 2010; 2011), which\ndeals with predication from a dialogical perspective, discussing the\ninteraction between perceptual and conceptual knowledge.\n\nMaterial dialogues have in fact been included in the dialogical\nframework from the start, as Krabbe (1985: 297) points out. Material\ndialogues indeed had priority over formal dialogues in Lorenzen and\nLorenz\u2019s work (Kamlah & Lorenzen 1967 [1972]; Lorenz 1961,\n1968). However, Krabbe further points out that the standard dialogical\nframework developed thereafter did not focus on the material\ndialogues; he interprets this fact as a sign that formal dialogues\nhad, after all, priority over material dialogues in the dialogical\nframework.\n\nThe reasons are not explicit in the standard dialogical\nframework. It may be objected to the standard dialogical\nframework that it claims to be a \u201cgame of giving and asking for\nreasons\u201d, but that these reasons are implicit. One way to answer\nthis challenge is proposed in the Immanent Reasoning framework which\nprovides \u201clocal\u201d and \u201cstrategic\u201d reasons to\nanswer this objection.\n\nThe standard dialogical framework is not completely\ndialogical. The original project of the dialogical framework\nwas to have language games that link meaning and use so tightly\ntogether that no extra theoretic construction would be required for\nthese games (Lorenz 1970: 109): syntax and meaning are dealt with at\nthe level of the language games, without necessitating any metalogical\napproach (which would deprive the signs from their meaning). But could\nthis project be carried out? The standard dialogical framework does\nnot require any metalogical reasoning at the level, say, of the\nparticle rules, but it does presuppose for example that the players\nuse well-formed formulas (wff) for statements. The well\nformation can be checked at will, but only with the usual meta\nreasoning by which one checks that the expression does indeed observe\nthe definition of a wff.\n\nSo can the dialogical framework be entirely based on language games,\nwithout any metalogical recourses? Or does it need at some point to\ncall on devices outside dialogues themselves? A typology of dialogical\napproaches to logic can be sketched according to their degree of\ndependency on non-dialogical frameworks:\n\ncomplete dependency (exits the Lorenzen and Lorenz tradition):\ne.g., the Built-In Opponent conception of deduction, which depends on\nanother framework, usually Natural Deduction (Dutilh Novaes &\nFrench 2018; French 2021);\nlimited dependency: the standard dialogical framework, which\ndepends on metalogical considerations for checking that the statements\nare syntactically well formed;\nno dependency: the Immanent Reasoning framework, in which 1. the\nmeaning of the logical constants, 2. the syntactic formation of the\nstatements, and 3. the content of the elementary statements, are all\ntaken in charge through dialogues and their rules.\n\n3.2 Immanent Reasoning\n\nAn outline of the Immanent Reasoning framework will here be sketched,\nwith an emphasis on the elements answering to the three objections\nmentioned above\n (Section 3.1),\n and which constitute major amendments to the standard dialogical\nframework. The framework is extensively presented and discussed in\nRahman et al. (2018).\n\nFirst, the local reasons will be introduced, which answer the second\nobjection that the reasons are not explicit in the standard framework.\nThen the synthesis and analysis of local reasons, and the structural\nrules are briefly mentioned, which replace the particle and structural\nrules of the standard framework. A detailed example follows,\nillustrating how dialogues in the Immanent Reasoning framework are\ncarried out. The formation dialogues are then introduced (answering\nthe third objection), and finally the material dialogues, which can\ndeal with content at the elementary level, and with empirical\npropositions (answering the first objection).\n3.2.1 Making everything explicit using local reasons\n\nDialogues are games of giving and asking for reasons; yet, in the\nstandard dialogical framework, the reasons for each statement are left\nimplicit and do not appear in the notation of the statement.\nStatements of the form\n\n\\(\\mathbf{X} \\state A\\)\n\nwhere \\(A\\) is an elementary proposition, are to be read as\n\n\\(\\mathbf{X}\\) states \\(A\\).\n\nThese statements do not give any information on the reasons\nbacking this statement.\n\nThe Immanent Reasoning framework imports Martin-L\u00f6f\u2019s 1984\nConstructive Type Theory (CTT) form of a judgement in order to make\nthese reasons explicit. Fully developed, statements thus have the\nfollowing form:\n\n\\(\\mathbf{X} \\ a : A\\)\n\nwhere \\(A\\) is a proposition and \\(a\\) its local reason,\ni.e., the particular, circumstantial reason that entitles one to state\n\\(A\\), which is read as\n\n\\(\\mathbf{X}\\) states that \\(a\\) provides evidence for \\(A\\).\n\nIn this fashion, the reasons one has for making a statement are\nspecified at the object-language level. The Immanent Reasoning\nframework distinguishes local reasons and strategic\nreasons. Local reasons are brought forth in particular plays, whereas\nstrategic reasons are a recapitulation of all the possible plays:\nlocal reasons provide relevant and sufficient means for winning a\nplay, but in general a local reason does not provide the appropriate\nground for constituting a winning strategy. Strategic reasons entitle\nto make assertions, i.e.,\u2006 provide relevant and sufficient means\nfor constituting a winning strategy justifying an assertion. The word\n\u201cstatement\u201d is used for the posits that have not yet\nreached the level of a justified assertion.\n\nWhen the reason is not explicit, the exclamation mark \u201c!\u201d\nmarks the presence of an implicit reason. Thus, in the\nstandard dialogical framework, each statement has an implicit reason\nbacking it: \\(\\mathbf{X} \\state A\\). This implicit reason may be made\nexplicit in the Immanent Reasoning framework (but it does not have\nto). To make this point more palatable, take for instance the\nstatement\n\n\\(\\mathbf{X} \\state\\) Bachir Diagne is from Senegal.\n\nThis statement has an implicit reason, which is the piece of evidence\nfor stating the proposition that Bachir Diagne is from\nSenegal. This piece of evidence can be a passport, for instance.\nBy expliciting the (empirical) local reason, the statement\nbecomes:\n\n\\(\\mathbf{X}\\) passport : Bachir Diagne is from\nSenegal.\n\nTaking inspiration in Martin-L\u00f6f\u2019s CTT goes with adopting\nan enriched language which aims at making everything explicit within\nthe language itself. For example, quantification is always restricted\nto a particular specified set, so that the formula \\((\\forall x: A)Px\\\n[A: set]\\) reads For all \\(x\\) in \\(A\\) \\(Px\\), where \\(A\\) is a\nset. Expressions such as \\(A: set\\) are added to the elementary\nstatements. Importantly, this does not mean that set-theoretic\nsemantics is suddenly introduced in the framework: CTT is in fact\nbased on the proposition-as-type principle or Curry-Howard\ncorrespondence (see the entry on Intuitionistic Type Theory). Other\nworks about the relation between game-based approaches to logic and\nMartin-L\u00f6f\u2019s CTT have been made with different perspectives\nand aims, starting with Ranta (1994). Recent works have provided\nimportant results on the use of game-based approaches to CTT for\nconstructive mathematics, inspired by Coquand (1995); see for instance\nSterling (2021).\n3.2.2 Local rules and an example\n\nThe particle rules determining the possible interaction of logically\nconstant terms and modal operators in the standard framework (see\n Section 2)\n are replaced in the Immanent Reasoning framework by synthesis and\nanalysis rules in order to take the local reasons into account. The\nrules for the logical constants presented here will determine\ninteraction for producing local reasons appropriate to the\nlogical constant at stake (synthesis rules), or for\nextracting local reasons embedded in more complex local\nreasons in a way that is characteristic of the constant at stake\n(analysis rules).\nSynthesis and analysis of local reasons (equivalent of particle rules)\n\nRules that prescribe how to explicitly bring forward local reasons are\ncalled the synthesis rules for local reasons. They are\nplayer-independent rules. A statement with an implicit reason\n(\u201c!\u201d) is challenged, and through this interaction the\nimplicit local reasons are made explicit. For instance, the synthesis\nof local reasons for an implication (\\(\\varphi \\supset \\psi\\)) is a\nchallenge on the implication with implicit reason, where the\nchallenger (\\(\\mathbf{Y}\\)) states the antecedent (\\(\\varphi\\)) with\nan explicit reason of his choice (\\(p_1)\\), and the defender\n(\\(\\mathbf{X}\\)) states the consequent (\\(\\psi)\\) with an explicit\nreason of his choice (\\(p_2)\\):\n\n\n\nStatement\nChallenge\nDefence  \n\n\n\\(\\mathbf{X}\\ {\\state {\\varphi \\supset \\psi}}\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{Y}\\ p_1 : \\varphi\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{X}\\ p_2 : \\psi\\)  \n\n\nThe synthesis of local reasons for universal quantification requires\nthat the challenger provides an element of the set (an instance, which\nis also a local reason), the one he wishes (here \\(p_1\\)), and the\ndefender provides a local reason (\\(p_2\\)) for the quantified\nproposition, in which the variable (\\(x\\)) is replaced by the\nchallenger\u2019s instance (\\(p_1\\)):\n\n\n\nStatement\nChallenge\nDefence  \n\n\n\\(\\mathbf{X}\\state {(\\forall x:A) \\varphi(x)}\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{Y}\\ p_1 : A\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{X}\\ p_2 : \\varphi(p_1)\\)  \n\n\nThe complete and precise definition of the synthesis of local reasons\nis given by rules for the statements depending on their form (like the\ntwo examples above). The complete table of synthesis rules can be\nfound in Rahman et al. (2018).\n\nOnce the local reasons are explicit, statements can be further\nchallenged and defended in accordance to another set of rules called\nthe analysis rules for local reasons which prescribe how to\ndecompose the local reason associated with a statement in such a way\nthat the component(s) render the local reasons prescribed by the\nsynthesis rules. They require instructions, which are\nprocedures that need to be carried out (the resolution of\ninstructions), and the successive application of this process will\neventually yield local reasons for elementary statements. For example,\nin the case of an implication, the local reason is actually a\ncomplex \u201clocal\u201d reason: there is a reason for the\nantecedent, and a reason for the consequent. The instructions are\nprocedures that isolate these parts of a complex reason: the left\ninstruction (here \\(L^{\\supset}(p)\\)) takes the reason for the\nantecedent, and the right instruction (here \\(R^{\\supset}(p)\\)) takes\nthe reason for the consequent:\n\n\n\nStatement\nChallenge\nDefence  \n\n\n\\(\\mathbf{X}\\ p : \\varphi \\supset \\psi\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{Y}\\ L^{\\supset}(p) : \\varphi\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{X}\\ R^{\\supset}(p) : \\psi\\)  \n\n\nThe resolution of instructions is defined by a structural rule. Both\nplayers are entitled to request that the other player resolves his\ninstructions and provides a proper local reason, as showcased in moves\n6 and 9 of the example below.\n\nThe analysis and synthesis of local reasons replace the particle rules\nof the standard framework and enable to deal with explicit local\nreasons.\nStructural rules for Immanent Reasoning\n\nThe structural rules in the Immanent Reasoning framework are modified\nto allow for the explicit mention of reasons, for the use of initial\nconcessions, for inserting formation dialogues, for the resolution of\ninstructions, for challenging and defending elementary statements, and\nfor making explicit the equalities that are used in the\nstandard framework\u2019s Formal Rule (\u201cmy reasons for stating\n\\(A\\) are the same as yours\u201d). The latter two points (about\nelementary statements and equalities) are defined by the Socratic\nRule which replaces the Formal Rule of the standard framework.\nInstead of providing all the rules for this framework in details, we\nwill illustrate them in a commented example below. But let us give\nsome basic information about the Socratic Rule:\n\n\n\nAn elementary statement is a move of the form \\(\\mathbf{X}\\state\n\\varphi(c_i)\\) or \\(\\mathbf{X}\\,a:\\varphi(c_i)\\), where\n\\(\\varphi(c_i)\\) is an atomic formula; \n\n\nThere is a synthesis rule for elementary statements: from a move\n\\(\\mathbf{X}\\state \\varphi(c_i)\\), player \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) can request\n\\(\\mathbf{X}\\) to make the local reason for the atomic formula\nexplicit; \n\n\nThere are analysis rules for elementary statements: players can\nchallenge moves of the form \\(a:\\varphi(c_i)\\). The defences involve\ntracking the origin of local reasons in a play in terms of equalities\nbetween local reasons or, in the case of resolution of instructions,\nbetween local reasons and instructions. For the precise formulation of\nthese rules, see Rahman et al. (2018). \n\n\nExample: play for \\((\\forall x:A)(B(x)\\supset B(x))\\), with\nexplanations\n\n\n\nMoves 0\u20134: the proponent states the thesis, the\nplayers choose their repetition ranks. The opponent challenges the\nthesis using the synthesis rule for universal quantification\nand the proponent defends by instantiating his universal claim.\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\nO\nP\n\n\nmove\nstatement\nchallenge to move\nchallenge to move\nstatement\nmove  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\state\n(\\forall x:A)(B(x)\\supset B(x))\\)\n0 \n\n1\n\\(\\mathtt{n} :=\\rank{1}\\)\n\n\n\\(\\mathtt{m}:=\\rank{2}\\)\n2 \n\n3\n\\(p_1 : A\\)\n(0)\n\n\\(p_2 : B(p_1)\n\\supset B(p_1)\\)\n4 \n\n \n\n\nMove 5: the opponent challenges the implication with\nlocal reason (analysis rule). A local reason for an implication is\ncomplex: it has a left part for the antecedent, and a right part for\nthe consequent. She thus uses an instruction to take only the left\npart of \\(p_2\\) as the reason for the antecedent.\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\nO\nP\n\n\nmove\nstatement\nchallenge to move\nchallenge to move\nstatement\nmove  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\state (\\forall\nx:A)(B(x)\\supset B(x))\\)\n0 \n\n1\n\\(\\mathtt{n} :=\\rank{1}\\)\n\n\n\\(\\mathtt{m}:=\\rank{2}\\)\n2 \n\n3\n\\(p_1 : A\\)\n(0)\n\n\\(p_2 : B(p_1) \\supset\nB(p_1)\\)\n4 \n\n5\n\\(L^{\\supset}(p_2)\n: B(p_1)\\)\n(4)\n\n\n  \n \n\n\nMoves 6\u20137: before answering the\nopponent\u2019s challenge, the proponent requests that she resolves\nthe instruction in move 5, i.e., that she gives a proper local reason\ninstead of an instruction (structural rule, resolution of\ninstructions).

Accordingly, additional dialogical rules\nexplain the formation of statements involving logical constants. The\nformation of elementary propositions is governed by the Socratic Rule\n(like the use of elementary statements was governed by the\nFormal Rule in the standard framework).\n\nIn this way, the opponent may (but does not have to) examine the well\nformation of the thesis with the challenge\n\u201c\\(\\rqst_{\\bprop}\\)\u201d before starting to ask for reasons.\nThe formation rules for logical constants and for\nfalsum are given in the following table. Notice that a\nstatement \u201c\\(\\bot: \\bprop\\)\u201d (which reads \\(\\bot\\) is\na proposition) cannot be challenged; this is the dialogical\naccount for falsum \u201c\\(\\bot\\)\u201d being by definition a\nproposition.\n\n\n\n\nStatement\nChallenge\nDefence  \n\n\nConjunction\n\\(\\mathbf{X}\\,A\\land{}B: \\bprop\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{Y}\\rqst F_{\\land{}1}\\) or \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\rqst\nF_{\\land{}2}\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{X}\\,A: \\bprop\\) (resp.) \\(\\mathbf{X}\\,B: \\bprop\\)\n\n\nDisjunction\n\\(\\mathbf{X}\\,A\\lor{}B: \\bprop\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{Y}\\rqst F_{\\lor{}1}\\) or \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\rqst\nF_{\\lor{}2}\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{X}\\,A: \\bprop\\) (resp.) \\(\\mathbf{X}\\,B: \\bprop\\)\n\n\nImplication\n\\(\\mathbf{X}\\,A\\supset{}B: \\bprop\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{Y}\\rqst F_{\\supset{}1}\\) or \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\rqst\nF_{\\supset{}2}\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{X}\\,A: \\bprop\\) (resp.) \\(\\mathbf{X}\\,B: \\bprop\\)\n\n\nUniversal quantification\n\\(\\mathbf{X}\\,(\\forall{}x: A)B(x): \\bprop\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{Y}\\rqst F_{\\forall{}1}\\) or \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\rqst\nF_{\\forall{}2}\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{X}\\,A: \\bset\\) (resp.) \\(\\mathbf{X}\\,B(x): \\bprop{}[x:\nA]\\) \n\nExistential quantification\n\\(\\mathbf{X}\\,(\\exists{}x: A)B(x): \\bprop\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{Y}\\rqst F_{\\exists{}1}\\) or \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\rqst\nF_{\\exists{}2}\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{X}\\,A: \\bset\\) (resp.) \\(\\mathbf{X}\\,B(x): \\bprop{}[x:\nA]\\) \n\nFalsum\n\\(\\mathbf{X}\\,\\bot: \\bprop\\)\n\\(--\\)\n\\(--\\)  \n\nExample of a formation dialogue\n\nThe thesis is \\((\\forall x:A)(B(x)\\supset B(x))\\).

See below for\nmaterial dialogues\n (Section 3.2.4).\n In order to avoid (for whatever reason) these material\nconsiderations, initial concessions may be added to the\nthesis in square brackets, for instance \\(A: \\bset\\). When accepting\nto play, the opponent also accepts these concessions for the sake of\nthe argument.\nExample of a formation dialogue with initial concessions\n\nThe thesis is the same as the previous one, with the added initial\nconcessions \\(A: \\bset\\) and \\(B(x) : \\bprop \\, [x : A]\\).\n\n\\[(\\forall x:A)(B(x)\\supset B(x))\\quad \\big[ A: \\bset \\,;\\, B(x) : \\bprop{} \\,[x : A]\\big]\\]\n\n\nThe proponent states the thesis (move 0), the opponent starts playing:\nshe accepts the concessions (0.1 and 0.2) and chooses her repetition\nrank (move 1).

In the context of the Immanent Reasoning\nframework, this is explained as stemming from shortcomings of the\nstandard approach, and it is argued that this can be overcome when\nlocal reasons are expressed. The claim is then that by doing so it is\npossible to fulfill this original intention of the dialogical\nframework.\n\nThe point of material dialogues is that each elementary sentence\ninvolving a set such as \\(a: A\\)\u2014where \\(A:set\\)\u2014requires\na special adaptation of the Socratic Rule (i.e., the rule about\nelementary sentences which replaces the standard Formal Rule). This\nspecial Socratic Rule prescribes, for each elementary statement, what\na player is committing to when making that statement. Note that these\nrules are not player independent, they belong to the\nstructural rules. This amounts to the following general points.\n\n\n\nMaterial dialogues must include synthesis rules for elementary\nstatements. \n\n\nWhen O states an elementary statement, she can be\nasked to produce the local reason specific to that elementary\nstatement, according to the suitable synthesis rule or equality rule.\nThe specific rules depend on the elementary statements at stake: for\nexample, the rules for statements about some object being a natural\nnumber will be different from the ones for statements about some\nindividual being French, and so on. Rahman et al. (2018) introduce\nsome examples, including the rules for elementary statements involving\nthe identity predicate. \n\n\nOnly when the previous step has been accomplished can\nP take over in order to fulfill his duty of defending\nthe same elementary statement. \n\nExample: natural numbers\n\nTake for instance the statements about natural numbers, e.g.,\n\n\n\n\\(\\mathbf{X}~ 0 : \\mathbb{N}\\) (\\(\\mathbf{X}\\) states that 0 is a\nnatural number) \n\n\n\\(\\mathbf{X}~ s(0) : \\mathbb{N}\\) (\\(\\mathbf{X}\\) states that the\nsuccessor of 0 is a natural number) \n\n\n\\(\\mathbf{X}~ n : \\mathbb{N}\\) (\\(\\mathbf{X}\\) states that \\(n\\) is a\nnatural number) \n\n\nThese are all elementary statements. The rules for elementary\nstatements concerning natural numbers are the following: if a player\n\\(\\mathbf{X}\\) states that \\(n\\) is a natural number, \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\)\nmay request that \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) states that \\(s(n)\\) is a natural\nnumber.\n\n\n\n\nStatement\nChallenge\nDefence  \n\n\n\\(\\mathbf{X}~ n:\\mathbb{N} \\)\n\\(\\mathbf{Y}\\rqst s(n)\\)\n\\(\\mathbf{X}~ s(n):\\mathbb{N}\\)\n\n\n\n\nThe special Socratic Rule for natural numbers establishes a set of\nnominal definitions (defiendum \\(\\equiv_{df}\\)\ndefiniens): \n\n\\[\\begin{align} \n1 & \\equiv_{df} s(0)\\\\ \n2 & \\equiv_{df} s(s(0))\\\\ \n& \\vdots\\\\ \nn & \\equiv_{df} s(s(\\ldots s(0)\\ldots )). \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nWhat is more, O may challenge a statement\nP \\(n:\\mathbb{N}\\) by requesting (O\n\\(\\rqst n\\)) that P provides one of the accepted\nnominal definitions above (P \\(s(s(\\ldots s(0)\\ldots\n)) \\equiv_{df} n : \\mathbb{N}\\)). However, P may\nprovide such a nominal definition only if O has\npreviously stated the definiens (here \\(s(s(\\ldots s(0)\\ldots\n))\\)).\nExample of material play for the thesis \\(2:\\mathbb{N} ~ [0:\\mathbb{N}]\\).\n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\nO\nP\n\n\nmove\nstatement\nchallenge to move\nchallenge to move\nstatement\nmove  \n\n\n0.1\n\\(0:\\mathbb{N}\\)\n\n\n\\(2:\\mathbb{N} ~\n[0:\\mathbb{N}]\\)\n0 \n\n1\n\\(\\mathtt{n} :=\\rank{1}\\)\n\n\n\\(\\mathtt{m}:=\\rank{2}\\)\n2 \n\n3\n\\(\\rqst 2\\)\n(0)\n\n\\(2 \\equiv_{df}\ns(s(0)) : \\mathbb{N}\\)\n8 \n\n5\n\\(s(0) : \\mathbb{N}\\)\n\n(0.1)\n\\(\\rqst s(0)\\)\n4 \n\n7\n\\(s(s(0)): \\mathbb{N}\\)\n\n(5)\n\\(\\rqst s(s(0))\\)\n6 \n\nP wins\nthe play.  \n\n\nExplanations\n\n\n\nMove 0: P states the thesis: 2 is a\nnatural number, provided that 0 is a natural number. \n\n\nMoves 0.1\u20133: O states the\ninitial concession, that 0 is a natural number; the players choose\ntheir repetition ranks and O challenges\nP\u2019s thesis by requesting that he justifies his\nclaim that 2 is a natural number. \n\n\nMoves 4\u20135: before answering\nO\u2019s challenge, P challenges\nO\u2019s concession (move 0.1), and requests that\nO states that the successor of 0 is a natural number.\nO complies. \n\n\nMoves 6\u20137: P proceeds in the\nsame way for the successor of 0, O complies. Thus,\nO has stated the required definiens for\nP\u2019s thesis. \n\n\nMove 8: P is able to answer\nO\u2019s pending challenge (move 3) by stating the\nnominal definition that 2 is the successor of the successor of 0, thus\njustifying his thesis that 2 is a natural number. O\nhas no available move left, so she loses. \n\n3.3 The Built-In Opponent\n\nAs mentioned in\n Section 1,\n the present entry focuses on the Lorenzen and Lorenz tradition of\ndialogical logic (tradition 1). It may however be of use to outline\nthe general ideas of the Built-In Opponent (BIO) conception of\ndeduction, even though Catarina Dutilh Novaes stresses in her work\nthat this approach is distinct from the Lorenzen and Lorenz dialogical\ntradition (e.g., Dutilh Novaes 2015: 600; 2020: 37; Dutilh Novaes & French\n2018: 135).\n\nThe BIO conception of deduction is a rational reconstruction of\ndeductive reasoning inspired by certain historical considerations (see\nfor example Dutilh Novaes, 2016). In this regard, it claims neither\nhistorical nor factual accuracy, but it is a rational\nreconstruction of deductive reasoning, historically\ninspired. The purpose of this framework is to provide a\ndialogical interface\u2014in the sense of a junction\npoint\u2014between actual reasoning (deduction understood as a social\npractice, not as a logical norm) and formal logic. The BIO interface\ndeals mostly with people\u2019s actual reasoning patterns (Dutilh\nNovaes 2013) and informal logic (Dutilh Novaes & French 2018:\n131), bringing the general features of logic and argumentation to the\nfore. Thus,\n\n\nthe main claim is that, rather than comprising the canons for correct\nthinking, the traditional principles of deduction reflect\nrules for engaging in certain kinds of dialogical practices.\n(Dutilh Novaes 2015: 599)\n\n\nThis interface thus allows to approach empirical studies concerning\nthe way people actually reason with a dialogical model in mind, and\nthus explain the greater or lesser magnitude (across cultures and\nwithin a culture) with which people\u2019s reasoning patterns diverge\nfrom the norms of classical logic, by the greater or lesser\nfamiliarity these people have with certain types of dialogues they\nengage in. Thus, for instance, familiarity with testing situations\ncommon in school would greatly help people understand what is expected\nof them during the questioning process the empirical studies use for\nobtaining their data (Dutilh Novaes 2013).\n\nBut this BIO interface also allows to approach logical\nconsiderations from a dialogical perspective, either by considering\ndeduction as a very specialized social practice, or by putting\nGentzen\u2019s Natural Deduction or Sequent Calculus into a\ndialogical setting (French 2015; Dutilh Novaes & French 2018;\nFrench 2021). Deduction in itself is considered as an essentially\ndialogical matter (Dutilh Novaes 2013; 2015; 2016; 2020), where the role of\nthe interlocutor (the Opponent or Skeptic) has been\n\u201cinternalized\u201d over time, in the sense that the deductive\nmethod has integrated its role, which is not apparent anymore (Dutilh\nNovaes 2015: 600). In this regard, when a mathematician or a logician\nspells out a proof, they adopt both roles, the proponent\u2019s and\nthe opponent\u2019s. This is the idea behind the \u201cBuilt-In\nOpponent\u201d expression which was inspired by G\u00f6ran\nSundholm\u2019s lectures and talks on assertion, by the year 2000,\nwhen suggesting the idea that elimination rules can be read as the\nmoves of an opponent aimed at testing the thesis. Another work dealing\nwith the connexion between Natural Deduction and the dialogical\napproach in the sense of tradition 1 is Rahman et al. (2009) which was\nalso directly influenced by Sundholm\u2019s suggestion, and where the\nbranches in the inference rules are said to incarnate the\nchoices of the players as they appear in the extensive form of a\nstrategy. The BIO conception shares this inspiration but developed in\nits own, proper dialogical conception and its proper objectives.\n\nThe BIO interface mostly takes the form of Prover-Skeptic games\ninspired from S\u00f8rensen and Urzyczyn (2006), which developed a\ndialogical framework motivated by questions in the study of\ncomputation. In the BIO, the Prover (or proponent) is the player who\nproves that the conclusion of the deduction follows from the premises,\nand the Skeptic (or opponent) is the player who doubts each step of\nthe proof and who will raise objections if he can. The game starts\nwith Prover asking Skeptic to grant the premises, which Skeptic\naccepts for the sake of the argument. Then Prover states what\nnecessarily follows from these premises, and Skeptic\u2019s role is\nto make sure that each new statement made by Prover clearly follows\nfrom the previous statements. Prover can thus provide counter-examples\nto a statement or ask clarifications (\u201cwhy does this\nfollow?\u201d). Skeptic\u2019s role is thus to check that the proof\nis compelling. The play is asymmetric, since Prover defends and\nSkeptic attacks.\n\nFrom this informal structure, the BIO interface can import traditional\nNatural Deduction, with the introduction and elimination rules, or\neven a \u201c\u2018structurally explicit\u2019 sequent to sequent\nstyle\u201d version (French 2021: section 3.1) in the fashion of\nDummett (1977). Prover then brings forth sequents for Skeptic to\naccept, and Prover is entitled to state sequents that follow in virtue\nof the introduction and elimination rules or in virtue of\n\u201cstructural\u201d rules.\n\nAs mentioned above, \u201cstructural rules\u201d may refer to two\nthings: either to the standard dialogical structural rules presented\nin Section 2, or, as it is here the case, to rules imported from\nanother framework (which would be called \u201cstrategic\u201d rules\nin the standard framework). In the BIO approach, Prover can thus\nproduce sequents that follow from others in virtue of rules such as\ncontraction or weakening. The aim of this kind of dialogical approach\nis to understand the \u201cstructural\u201d properties of\ndeduction.\n\nWhen concerned with formal logic, the BIO interface thus has purely\nstrategic considerations, and is not much concerned by the play level.\nIn this respect, the disappearance of the opponent in deductive proofs\nis justified through the strategic focus: Prover does not actually\nneed Skeptic if Prover is careful enough in carrying out the deductive\nmethod (making gap-free proofs).\n",
