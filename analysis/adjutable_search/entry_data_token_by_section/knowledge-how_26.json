    "main_text": "Knowledge-How and Skill || The Nature of Skilled Action\n10. Knowledge-How and Other Related Topics\n\nKnowledge-how is related to but distinct from practical\nknowledge (Anscombe 1957). Practical knowledge is occurrent\nduring intentional action: when one intentionally acts, one knows what\none is doing while knowing it. While being capable of practical\nknowledge might require knowledge-how, knowing how to perform an\naction does not entail performing that action, and so does not entail\npractical knowledge (Setiya 2008; Schwenkler 2019; Small 2020). Some\nhave argued knowledge-how is the norm of intention (Habgood-Coote\n2018b), so that one can properly intend to perform an act only if one\nknows how to perform it. \n\nAn important question is whether knowledge-how is connected to\ndistinctive kinds of epistemic injustice (Fricker 2007; Dotson 2011;\nCollins 1990, 1998; Medina 2011). Hawley (2011) discusses the\nphenomena whereby people ascribe less knowledge-how and ability to\nfemale musicians (Goldin & Rouse 2000) and whereby standards for\njudgments of success due to ability rather than luck or\n\u201cinstinct\u201d tend to be higher for women and non-white men\n(Biernat & Kobrynowicz 1997). In these cases, agents may be\ntransmitting knowledge by being direct sources of information, rather\nthan by testifying to the truth of a proposition. If so, the harms\nthat they suffer might call for a different account than standard\ncases of epistemic injustices like Fricker\u2019s (2007), which focus\non testimonial transmission of knowledge-that.\n\nA final topic of interest is the relation between knowledge-how and\nfaith. While most views on faith focus on its doxastic aspect, Sliwa\n(2018) argues that faith essentially involves agents acting in the\nright way with respect to the object of their faith. Having faith in a\nperson, for instance, requires knowing how to interact with them so as\nto trust them, help them, and ensure their autonomy in general.\nReligious faith, similarly, requires faithful agents to know how to\nenact the relevant practices like going to mass, declaring one\u2019s\nfaith, and praying.\n",
