    "main_text": "Ethics || Distress (lup\u0113)\n8.3 Distress (lup\u0113)\nGalen\u2019s approach to the path\u0113 is not systematic, nor aimed at giving a detailed classification, as were some Stoic approaches; however, he does share with the Stoics some classificatory tendencies. He identifies what seems to be an over-arching category of pathos, that of distress (lup\u0113). Distress has relevance to a whole range of individual path\u0113: grief at loss, envy of another\u2019s greater success or wealth, annoyance at a servant\u2019s careless behaviour, all may be considered either as instances of distress or as giving rise to distress. The ethical project of controlling the path\u0113 can thus to a large extent, it seems, be understood as the project of avoidance of distress. \u201cFreedom from distress\u201d (alupia)\u2014the title of a recently-discovered work which discusses personal experiences and approaches to the problem in vivid detail (Ind.)\u2014thus begins to look quite similar to the Stoic aim of \u201cunaffectedness\u201d (apatheia). Such unaffectedness \u2013 with the caveats already made as to its achievability in all cases\u2014does indeed seem to be a part of Galen\u2019s ethical project. The desire to free oneself from distress, it is also suggested, may provide a practical starting-point for the ethical project, for the simple reason that no one actually wishes to live with distress (whereas people may be happy to live with vices which do not immediately cause this negative experience). (Further on Galen\u2019s ethics as expounded in Ind. see Kaufman 2014; Singer 2019c.)\n",
