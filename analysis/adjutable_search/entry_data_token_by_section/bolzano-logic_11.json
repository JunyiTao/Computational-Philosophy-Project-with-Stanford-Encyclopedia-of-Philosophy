    "main_text": "Bolzano\u2019s logic of variation || Conditional probability\n6.4 Conditional probability\n\nAccording to Bolzano\u2019s definition, deducibility requires\ncompatibility. This gives rise to some complications, e.g.,\ndeducibility is not reflexive, and from the fact that \\(B\\) is\ndeducible from \\(A\\) with respect to \\(i, j, \\ldots\\) we can conclude\nthat not-\\(A\\) is deducible from not-\\(B\\) only if \\(B\\) is not\nuniversally valid with respect to \\(i, j, \\ldots.\\) But it also brings\nan important benefit, namely, it allows him to integrate a relation of\nrelative probability directly into his system. In TS, \u00a7\n161, he defines the conditional probability (or relative\nvalidity) of a proposition M(i) with respect\nto a class of premises or hypotheses\nA(i) with variables\ni, as the ratio of the number of cases in which all\nthe propositions of the class as well as\nM(i) are true to the number of cases in\nwhich the propositions A(i) are all\ntrue. In other words, it is the ratio of the number of true variants\nof A(i) and\nM(i) to the number of true variants of\nA(i). Bolzano\u2019s conditional\nprobability is objective, an sich. \n\nBecause for each objectual idea there are infinitely many other\nequivalent ones, we cannot determine relative probabilities simply by\ncounting variants. It could be done, however, if the class of\nsubstitutions were restricted as in the case of relative validity by\nonly allowing one idea among all those equivalent to a given one to be\nincluded in the class of substituends, provided that the resulting\nclasses were finite (Bolzano sets out a different proposal in\nTS, \u00a7161, no. 7).\n\nFor example, consider the premises [The number of eggs in the nest is\nbetween 1 and 10] and [The number of eggs in the nest is odd], along\nwith the conclusion [The number of eggs in the nest is prime], in\nwhich only the idea [the number of eggs in the nest] is considered\nvariable in each of the propositions. Of the admissible substitutions,\nfour make both premises true and, of those four, three make the\nconclusion true as well. Thus the degree of validity of the conclusion\nrelative to the premises and the specified variable is .75. We can\nalso think of this as a relation between the forms \u2018A is\nbetween 1 and 10\u2019, \u2018A is odd\u2019, and\n\u2018A is prime\u2019. \n\nOne can immediately see why the premises of a probable deduction must\nbe compatible: the probability of M(i)\nrelative to A(i) is defined only if the denominator\nof the fraction is not zero, which means that the premises\nA(i) are compatible. On the other\nhand, the number of ideas that make both\nA(i) and\nM(i) true cannot be greater than the number\nof ideas that make true M(i); as a\nconsequence, the conditional probability of\nM(i) cannot be greater than 1. It is equal\nto 1 when the number of ideas that make true both\nA(i) and\nM(i) is equal to the number of ideas that\nmake true A(i) alone, which means\nthat all substitutions of ideas that make true\nA(i) also make true\nM(i), i.e., if\nM(i) is deducible from\nA(i). In other words, if\nM(i) is deducible from\nA(i), its probability relative to\nA(i) is equal to 1, which means that\nthe probability equals certainty. The probability is zero if no ideas\nmake both A(i) and\nM(i) true, i.e., if\nA(i) and\nM(i) are incompatible. Incompatibility and\ncertainty are thus two extreme cases of probability with values of 0\nand 1.\n\nThough some details remain rough, this is still an extraordinary\nachievement. Bolzano\u2019s approach yields the first logical\ndefinition of probability. For the first time deductive logic and\ninductive logic are united in a global theory and the former appears\nas a limit case of the latter. It is possible that in his\nTractatus 5.15, Wittgenstein took over Bolzano\u2019s\ntreatment of probability, perhaps through the mediation of the 1st\nedition of the Philosophical Propedeutic of R. Zimmermann\n(1853). Carnap\u2019s regular confirmation functions, too, are\nstrongly reminiscent of Bolzano\u2019s approach.\n\nBolzano adds proofs of a number of standard theorems, and also defines\nsubjective probability and different important probabilistic notions\nsuch as the degree of confidence, the credibility of a witness, etc.\nHe gives the formula of the degree of credibility of an event reported\nby independent testimonies as a function of the number of witnesses,\nof the number of testimonies, and of the number of true and false\npropositions stated by each witness. All these concepts play an\nimportant role in the chapter \u201con the nature of historical\nknowledge, particularly concerning miracles\u201d in Bolzano\n1834.\n\nBoth the class-logical relations and the relations between\npropositions are constructed from the initial relation of\ncompatibility by adding specific conditions to previously defined\nrelations. Compatibility is thus the basic relation of Bolzano\u2019s\nextensional logic. It is embedded in the very foundations of his\nsystem and all other relations (with the exception of different cases\nof disjunction, TS II, \u00a7160), deducibility included, are\nspecial cases of it.\n",
