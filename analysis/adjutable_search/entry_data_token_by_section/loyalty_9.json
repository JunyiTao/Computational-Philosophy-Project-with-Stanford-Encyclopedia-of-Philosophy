    "main_text": "Loyalty as a virtue\n4. Loyalty as a virtue\n\nMark Twain (1935) and Graham Greene (\u201cthe virtue of\ndisloyalty,\u201d 1973) notwithstanding, there is greater agreement\nthat disloyalty is a vice than that loyalty is a virtue (Kleinig,\nforthcoming). Perhaps the frequency with which the demand for\nloyalty is used to \u201cjustify\u201d engagement in unethical\nconduct has led to cynicism about its value. There is a certain\nresonance to the saying that \u201cwhen an organization wants you to\ndo right, it asks for your integrity; when it wants you to do wrong,\nit demands your loyalty.\u201d What might it be about loyalty that\nmakes it vulnerable to such uses?\n\nThere are those who, on the basis of their particular theory of\nvirtue, deny that loyalty could be a virtue. R.E. Ewin, for example,\nargued that because loyalty can be badly placed (as in the case of the\nloyal Nazi) and because, once formed, it requires us not merely to\nsuspend our own judgment about its object but even to set aside good\njudgment (Ewin, 1992, 403, 411), its pretensions to the status of a\nvirtue are undermined, for the virtues are, he argued, internally\nlinked to some idea of good judgment. The worth of any particular\nloyalty is thus reducible to judgments about the worth of the\nassociations to which loyalty is given or the legitimacy of what is\ndone as a result of them and is not due to loyalty in general being a\nvirtue.\n\nThere are two problems with this account. First, the understanding of\nthe virtues may be thought too restrictive. As with loyalty,\nconscientiousness and sincerity can be directed to unworthy objects,\nbut conscientiousness and sincerity do not for that reason fail as\nvirtues. It is arguable that had Ewin given consideration to the view\nthat virtues operate, as Philippa Foot puts it, \u201cat a point at\nwhich there is some temptation to be resisted or deficiency of\nmotivation to be made good\u201d (Foot, 1978, 8)\u2014he might have\nbeen able to accommodate them within a catalogue of virtues.\nPerseverance in human associations often requires individuals to make\nsacrifices for the good of the individual or group with whom the\nindividual associates, sacrifices that self-interest naturally tempts\nus not to make.\n\nThe second problem has to do with the idea that loyalty requires us to\nset aside good judgment. No doubt something of that kind is attempted\nby those who seek to exploit loyalty (and other virtues such as\ngenerosity and kindness). But the well-established idea of a\n\u201cloyal opposition\u201d should give pause to the suggestion\nthat loyalty requires complaisance or servility (see section 6,\nLimiting Loyalty). Further, if the setting aside of good judgment is\nsought, there is nothing to stop a person\u2014albeit with a heavy\nheart\u2014from questioning whether the object of loyalty may have\nforfeited claims to it. The trust that tends to accompany loyalty need\nnot encompass gullibility and credulity. In the ordinary course of\nevents, the trust that accompanies loyalty has a judgment of\ntrustworthiness as its background.\n\nEwin\u2019s challenge does, nevertheless, raise the important\nquestion whether judgments about the worth of loyalty are reducible to\njudgments about the worth of the associations to which loyalty is\ngiven or the legitimacy of what is done as a result of them. Does\nloyalty have any value independent of the particular associational\nobject with which it is connected or is its value bound up exclusively\nwith the object of loyalty? There is disagreement on this (paralleling\ndisagreements about the obligatoriness of promise keeping). Some argue\nthat loyalty is virtuous or vicious depending on what is done out of\nloyalty. Others argue that loyalty is always virtuous, albeit\noverridden when associated with immoral conduct. In the case of a\nloyal Nazi whose loyalty expresses itself in anti-semitic forms, we\ncould respond in one of two ways. On the one hand, we could point to\nthe fact that the loyalty is likely to aggravate the harm caused. On\nthe other hand, were such a Nazi to act disloyally by allowing Jews\nwho bribed him to escape, we could argue that he is doubly\ndeficient\u2014self-serving and defective in his capacity to form\nclose bonds. Certainly the value of particular associations is of\nimportance to how we value loyalty to those associations; but it is\ndoubtful whether the value of loyalty is simply reducible to the value\nof the association in question. A person without loyalty or incapable\nof forming loyalties would seem to be defective as a person.\n\nIf loyalty is a virtue, what kind of virtue is it? The virtues are a\nmixed bag, conceptually and normatively. There are, for example, moral\nand intellectual virtues, Christian and pagan virtues. In the instant\ncase, there is a distinction between substantive and executive\nvirtues. The substantive virtues include compassion, fellow-feeling,\nkindness, and generosity, whereas the executive virtues include\nsincerity, courage, industriousness, and conscientiousness.\nSubstantive virtues motivate us to act well, that is, to do good, and\nare critical to our moral relations with others (and, in the case of\nprudence, to our own interests as well). The executive virtues, or, as\nthey are sometimes known, virtues of the will, are important to the\nimplementation of what the substantive virtues require of\nus\u2014sincerity in our compassion, courage in our kindness,\nconscientiousness in our generosity. They help us to surmount\nobstacles to our doing good. Loyalty, like sincerity, is an executive\nvirtue, and its worth in a particular case is especially sensitive to\nthe value of its object. Like other executive virtues, it can become\nattached to unworthy objects\u2014one may be a loyal Nazi or sincere\nracist. But that does not make their virtuousness merely contingent or\noptional. A world or person without sincerity or conscientiousness or\nloyalty would be a seriously deficient one. The capacity and ability\nto persevere in human associations that may require sacrifices from us\nare important to develop and exercise, and are what the virtue of\nloyalty consists in. Thus, insofar as we express loyalty in particular\nloyalties, we should distinguish the assessment of whether someone has\nthe virtue of loyalty from assessments of the worth of particular\nloyalties.\n\nThe executive virtues are an important ingredient in human excellence,\nbut, like all virtues, they should not be cultivated in isolation from\nthe substantive ones. When Aristotle discussed the virtues, he argued\nfor the importance of phronesis or practical wisdom in the\napplication of the virtues so that they would not be deficient,\nexcessive, or misplaced. In the fully virtuous person, the virtues\nwere never meant to be possessed in isolation but as an integrated\ncluster\u2014one of the things the ancients were plausibly getting at\nwhen they spoke of the unity of the virtues.\n\nThere is sometimes a further question about whether loyalty, even if a\nvirtue, should be seen as a moral virtue. Loyalty may be thought\nexcellent to have\u2014even a component of a good life\u2014but is\nit essentially a moral disposition? The divisions among virtues (say,\nintellectual, moral, personal, and social) are, however, at best\nunclear and probably overlapping. Kindness is almost always morally\ncommendable, but imaginativeness (often said to be an intellectual\nvirtue), courage (usually categorized as a personal virtue) and\nreliability (sometimes called a social virtue) may be shown on the\nsports field or by enemy soldiers as well as in contexts that render\nthem morally commendable. There may be no great value in attempts to\ndifferentiate loyalty (and other virtues) into rigid and exclusive\ncategories. What is almost certainly arguable is that a person who is\ncompletely devoid of loyalties would be deficient as a person\nunderstood inter alia as a moral agent.\n",
