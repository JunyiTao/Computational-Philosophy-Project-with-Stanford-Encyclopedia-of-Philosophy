    "main_text": "Planned Orders Are Inferior || Law As An Ecological Niche\n3.2 Law As An Ecological Niche\n\nIn nature, for biological adaptation to culminate in better-adapted\npopulations over time, the niche to which a population is adapting\nmust be relatively stable. Likewise, under a rule of law, the aim of\ngovernment is not to win but to provide a stable ecological niche that\nenables the game\u2019s true players to evolve strategies apt for\nsuccess within that niche. An elaborate crystal structure cannot form\nunless the medium in which crystals form is left undisturbed.\nHayek\u2019s ideal is a legal \u201cmedium\u201d of society,\nliberal enough to permit creativity, stable enough\nto reward creativity, and constraining enough (in the right\nways) to steer creativity away from zero-sum and negative-sum games\nand toward positive-sum games: that is, wealth creation, not wealth\ncapture.\n\nHere, then, in a few sentences, is one way of understanding\nHayek\u2019s point. Not everything that happens in an evolving\ncommunity is foreseen or intended. Actions have more than one\nconsequence, and more than the intended consequence. This is\nespecially so when there is more than one decision maker. No one\nfollows a planner\u2019s plan simply because the planner intends that\nthey do so. People adjust to the planner\u2019s plan in service of\ntheir own plans rather than those of the planner, and the result is\ntoo chaotic to be safely predictable. Further, the rule of law itself\nis an evolving product of ongoing decision making, so it likewise\ntakes a shape not intended by any legislator. Does this mean that\nevery order is tautologically a spontaneous order? The answer: it is a\nuniversally true empirical generalization, not a tautology, that every\nsocial organization, even a dictatorship, is partly an\nongoing product of ordering processes that are to some degree\nspontaneous. However, while the degree to which outcomes are\nunintended is a continuum, there remains a point in categorizing\ncommunities as centrally planned versus spontaneous. A central plan is\ndesigned to yield an end-state. The plan aims to bring about\nparticular outcomes\u2014what roles people will play, what they will\nachieve in those roles, and what they will win by so achieving. By\ncontrast, in what we should call spontaneous order, government\nprovides a stable and known framework of rules, aiming not to realize\na particular outcome so much as to realize a particular process (Hayek\n1944, 113). Although this ideal can never be fully achieved in\npractice, a government under rule of law acts as referee and provider\nof the rule book (Hayek 1960, 114) and operates as much as possible by\nan ideal of \u201cletting the players play.\u201d\n\nIs letting the players play good? Necessarily good? Adam Smith might\nhave said no, as might Hayek. A praiseworthy rule of law\u2014a\npraiseworthy market process\u2014 facilitates mutually\nbeneficial trade by internalizing externalities, by minimizing\ntransaction cost (especially when it comes to acquiring information),\nby minimizing opportunities to acquire people\u2019s goods without\ntheir consent (thereby encouraging people to trade on\nagreeable\u2014thus typically beneficial\u2014terms), and by being\nextremely cautious about trying to do more than that. When a\ngovernment succeeds in doing that much, and further succeeds in\nrestraining itself from trying to do more, progress is the likely\nresult, which is not to say progress is guaranteed. \n\nHayek had no particular complaint about providing public education or\nthe minimal elements of a welfare state, but not because such\ninstitutions are essential. Hayek would simply have said that such\ninstitutions need not devolve into central planning and thus need not\nbe antithetical to a free society. Issuing vouchers, for example, to\nsubsidize the purchase of epipens or education would to some extent\ndistort markets in the subsidized products (having an inflationary\nimpact on prices for those products) but it would not distort to the\nextent that price controls would.\n",
