    "main_text": "God\u2019s Relation to Creatures || Against the Manichees\n6.2 Against the Manichees\n\nRegarding the procession of creatures from God, William is concerned\nto attack a range of errors. In On the Universe Ia-Iae he\nattacks the error of the Manichees. Though he refers to Mani, the\nthird-century originator of the Manichee sect, he seems chiefly\nconcerned with the Cathars of his day. The Manichees deny God is the\nultimate source of all things and instead posit two first principles,\none good and one evil. Only in this way, they think, can we explain\nthe presence of both good and evil in the world. William thinks a\nfundamental motivation for this view is the principle that \u201cfrom\none of two contraries the other cannot come of itself\u201d (OO I,\n602a; Teske 1998a, 54), and hence that evil cannot come from good but\nmust stem from its own first principle. He replies that although one\ncontrary cannot of itself (per se) be from the other, it is\nperfectly possible for it to be from the other incidentally (per\naccidens), and he gives everyday examples to illustrate. Thus,\n\u201cdrunkenness comes from wine. In that case it is evident that an\nevil comes from a good, unless one would say that wine is not\ngood\u201d (OO I, 602a; Teske 1998a, 54). Likewise, there is a sense\nin which evil is ultimately from God, though incidentally and not as\nsomething God aims at or intends as such. The evil of sin, for\nexample, is a consequence of God\u2019s creating creatures with free\nwill and permitting their misuse of it.\n\nWilliam offers a host of arguments against the possibility of two\nfirst principles. On metaphysical grounds, for example, he objects\nthat a first principle must be a being necessary through itself, and\nthat he has shown that a plurality of such beings is impossible. And\nhe gives arguments to the effect that the notion of a creative first\nevil principle is incoherent. Such a being, for example, could not do\ngood for anything, and hence could not have created anything, for in\ndoing so it would have done good for what it created (see also\nBernstein 2005 and Teske 1993a).\n",
