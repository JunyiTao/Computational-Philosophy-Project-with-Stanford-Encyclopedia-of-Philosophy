In the most basic sense of the term,\nself-consciousness is not something that comes about the moment one\nattentively inspects or reflectively introspects one\u2019s\nexperiences, or recognizes one\u2019s specular image in the mirror,\nor refers to oneself with the use of the first-person pronoun, or\nconstructs a self-narrative. Rather, these different kinds of\nself-consciousness are to be distinguished from the prereflective\nself-consciousness which is present whenever I am living through or\nundergoing an experience, e.g., whenever I am consciously perceiving\nthe world, remembering a past event, imagining a future event,\nthinking an occurrent thought, or feeling sad or happy, thirsty or in\npain, and so forth.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Prereflective self-consciousness\n\nOne can get a bearing on the notion of prereflective\nself-consciousness by contrasting it with reflective\nself-consciousness. If you ask me to give you a description of the\npain I feel in my right foot, or of what I was just thinking about, I\nwould reflect on it and thereby take up a certain perspective that was\none order removed from the pain or the thought. Thus, reflective\nself-consciousness is at least a second-order cognition. It may be the\nbasis for a report on one\u2019s experience, although not all reports\ninvolve a significant amount of reflection.\n\nIn contrast, prereflective self-consciousness is pre-reflective in the\nsense that (1) it is an awareness we have before we do any reflecting\non our experience; (2) it is an implicit and first-order awareness\nrather than an explicit or higher-order form of self-consciousness.\nIndeed, an explicit reflective self-consciousness is possible only\nbecause there is a prereflective self-awareness that is an on-going\nand more primary kind of self-consciousness. Although phenomenologists\ndo not always agree on important questions about method, focus, or\neven whether there is an ego or self, they are in close to unanimous\nagreement about the idea that the experiential dimension always\ninvolves such an implicit prereflective self-consciousness. In line\nwith Edmund Husserl (1959, 189, 412), who maintains that consciousness\nalways involves a self-appearance\n(F\u00fcr-sich-selbst-erscheinens), and in agreement with\nMichel Henry (1963, 1965), who notes that experience is always\nself-manifesting, and with Maurice Merleau-Ponty who states that\nconsciousness is always given to itself and that the word\n\u2018consciousness\u2019 has no meaning independently of this\nself-givenness (Merleau-Ponty 1945, 488), Jean-Paul Sartre writes that\nprereflective self-consciousness is not simply a quality added to the\nexperience, an accessory; rather, it constitutes the very mode of\nbeing of the experience:\n\nThis self-consciousness we ought to consider not as a new\nconsciousness, but as the only mode of existence which is possible\nfor a consciousness of something (Sartre 1943, 20 [1956, liv]).\n\n\nWe find the same view, to mention just one more thinker, in Roman\nIngarden, who writes that I don\u2019t need any kind of introspection\nor reflection in order to gain acquaintance with my experiential life\nsince the first-order experience is already characterized by a\nparticular kind of conscious self-penetration (Ingarden 1992,\n155\u2013156). And as he then points out, the original mode of being of\nconscious life is precisely to be in the form of being self-conscious.\nIn the absence of such self-consciousness, an experience would not be\nan experience (Ingarden 1992, 156). In short, unless a mental process\nis prereflectively self-conscious there will be nothing it is like to\nundergo the process, and it therefore cannot be a phenomenally\nconscious process (Zahavi 1999, 2005, 2014). An implication of this is\nobviously that the self-consciousness in question is so fundamental\nand basic that it can be ascribed to all creatures that are\nphenomenally conscious, including various non-human animals.\n\nAs just noted, the notion of prereflective self-consciousness is\nrelated to the idea that experiences have a subjective\n\u2018feel\u2019 to them, a certain (phenomenal) quality of\n\u2018what it is like\u2019 or what it \u2018feels\u2019 like to\nhave them. As it is usually expressed outside of phenomenological\ntexts, to undergo a conscious experience necessarily means that there\nis something it is like for the subject to have that experience (Nagel\n1974; Searle 1992). This is obviously true of bodily sensations like\npain. But it is also the case for perceptual experiences, experiences\nof desiring, feeling, and thinking. There is something it is like to\ntaste chocolate, and this is different from what it is like to\nremember or imagine what it is like to taste chocolate, or to smell\nvanilla, to run, to stand still, to feel envious, nervous, depressed\nor happy, or to entertain an abstract belief.\n\nAll of these different experiences are, moreover, also characterized\nby their distinct first-personal character. The what-it-is-likeness of\nphenomenal episodes is properly speaking a\nwhat-it-is-like-for-me-ness. This for-me-ness doesn\u2019t\nrefer to a specific experiential quality like sour or soft, rather it\nrefers to the distinct first-personal givenness of experience. It\nrefers to the fact that the experiences I am living through are given\ndifferently (but not necessarily better) to me than to anybody else. I\nmay see that you are sad, but my seeing your sadness is qualitatively\ndifferent from my living through my sadness. It could consequently be\nclaimed that anybody who denies the for-me-ness of experience simply\nfails to recognize an essential constitutive aspect of experience.\nSuch a denial would be tantamount to a denial of the first-person\nperspective. It would entail the view that my own mind is either not\ngiven to me at all\u2014I would be mind- or self-blind\u2014or is\npresented to me in exactly the same way as the minds of others.\n\nWe can distinguish two uses of the term \u2018conscious\u2019, a\ntransitive and an intransitive use. On the one hand, we can speak of\nour being conscious of something, be it x, y, or\nz. On the other, we can speak of our being conscious\nsimpliciter (rather than non-conscious). For some time a\nwidespread way to account for intransitive consciousness in cognitive\nscience and analytic philosophy of mind has been by means of some kind\nof higher-order theory. The distinction between conscious and\nnon-conscious mental states has been taken to rest upon the presence\nor absence of a relevant meta-mental state (e.g., Armstrong 1968;\nCarruthers 1996, 2000; Lycan 1987, 1996; Rosenthal 1997). Thus,\nintransitive consciousness has been taken to depend upon the mind\ndirecting its intentional aim at its own states and operations. As\nPeter Carruthers puts it, the subjective feel of experience\npresupposes a capacity for higher-order awareness: \u201csuch\nself-awareness is a conceptually necessary condition for an organism\nto be a subject of phenomenal feelings, or for there to be anything\nthat its experiences are like\u201d (1996, 152). But for Carruthers,\nthe self-awareness in question is a type of reflection. In his view, a\ncreature must be capable of reflecting upon, thinking about, and hence\nconceptualizing its own mental states if those mental states are to be\nstates of which the creature is aware (1996, 155, 157).\n\nOne might share the view that there is a close link between\nconsciousness and self-consciousness and still disagree about the\nnature of the link. And although the phenomenological view might\nsuperficially resemble the view of the higher-order theories, we are\nultimately confronted with two quite different accounts. The\nphenomenologists explicitly deny that the self-consciousness that is\npresent the moment I consciously experience something is to be\nunderstood in terms of some kind of higher-order monitoring. Rather\nthan involving an additional mental state, it should rather to be\nunderstood as an intrinsic feature of the primary experience. That is,\nin contrast to higher-order accounts of consciousness that claim that\nconsciousness is an extrinsic or relational property of those mental\nstates that have it, a property bestowed upon them from without by\nsome further state, the phenomenologists would typically argue that\nthe feature in virtue of which a mental state is conscious is an\nintrinsic property of those mental states that have it. Moreover, the\nphenomenologists also reject the attempt to construe intransitive\nconsciousness in terms of transitive consciousness, that is, they\nreject the view that a conscious state is a state we are conscious of\nas object. To put it differently, not only do they reject the view\nthat a mental state becomes conscious by being taken as an object by a\nhigher-order state, they also reject the view (generally associated\nwith Brentano) according to which a mental state becomes conscious by\ntaking itself as an object (cf. Zahavi 2004; 2014).\n\nThat prereflective self-consciousness is implicit, then, means that I\nam not confronted with a thematic or explicit awareness of the\nexperience as belonging to myself. Rather we are dealing with a\nnon-observational self-acquaintance. Here is how Heidegger and Sartre\nput the point:\n\nDasein [human existence] as existing, is there for itself, even when\nthe ego does not expressly direct itself to itself in the manner of\nits own peculiar turning around and turning back, which in\nphenomenology is called inner perception as contrasted with outer. The\nself is there for the Dasein itself without reflection and without\ninner perception, before all reflection. Reflection, in the\nsense of a turning back, is only a mode of self-apprehension,\nbut not the mode of primary self-disclosure (Heidegger 1989, 226\n[1982, 159]).\n\nIn other words, every positional consciousness of an object is at the\nsame time a non-positional consciousness of itself. If I count the\ncigarettes which are in that case, I have the impression of disclosing\nan objective property of this collection of cigarettes: they are a\ndozen. This property appears to my consciousness as a property\nexisting in the world. It is very possible that I have no positional\nconsciousness of counting them. Then I do not know myself as counting.\nYet at the moment when these cigarettes are revealed to me as a dozen,\nI have a non-thetic consciousness of my adding activity. If anyone\nquestioned me, indeed, if anyone should ask, \u201cWhat are you doing\nthere?\u201d I should reply at once, \u201cI am counting.\u201d\n(Sartre 1943, 19\u201320 [1956, liii]).\n\nWhat arguments support the phenomenological claims, however?\nPhenomenologists don\u2019t simply appeal to a correct\nphenomenological description but provide additional, more theoretical,\narguments. One line of reasoning found in virtually all of the\nphenomenologists is the view that the attempt to let (intransitive)\nconsciousness be a result of a higher-order monitoring will generate\nan infinite regress. On the face of it, this is a rather old idea.\nTypically, the regress argument has been understood in the following\nmanner. If all occurrent mental states are conscious in the sense of\nbeing taken as objects by occurrent second-order mental states, then\nthese second-order mental states must themselves be taken as objects\nby occurrent third-order mental states, and so forth ad\ninfinitum. The standard response to this objection is that the\nregress can easily be avoided by accepting the existence of\nnon-conscious mental states. This is precisely the position adopted by\nthe defenders of higher-order theory. For them a second-order\nperception or thought does not have to be conscious. It would be\nconscious only if accompanied by a (non-conscious) third-order thought\nor perception (Rosenthal 1997, 745). The phenomenological reply to\nthis solution is rather straightforward, however. The phenomenologists\nwould concede that it is possible to halt the regress by postulating\nthe existence of non-conscious mental states, but they would maintain\nthat such an appeal to the non-conscious leaves us with a case of\nexplanatory vacuity. That is, they would find it quite unclear why the\nrelation between two otherwise non-conscious mental processes should\nmake one of them conscious. Or to put it differently, they would be\nquite unconvinced by the claim that a state without subjective or\nphenomenal qualities can be transformed into one with such qualities,\ni.e., into an experience with first-personal character, by the mere\naddition of a non-conscious meta-state having the first-state as its\nintentional object.\n\nThe phenomenological alternative avoids both vacuity and regress. As\nSartre writes: \u201c[T]here is no infinite regress here, since a\nconsciousness has no need at all of a reflecting [higher-order]\nconsciousness in order to be conscious of itself. It simply does not\nposit itself as an object\u201d (1936, 29 [1957, 45]). That is,\nprereflective self-consciousness is not transitive in relation to the\nstate (of) which it is aware. It is, as Sartre puts it, the mode of\nexistence of consciousness itself. This does not mean that a\nhigher-order meta-consciousness is impossible, but merely that it\nalways presupposes the existence of a prior non-objectifying,\nprereflective self-consciousness as its condition of possibility. To\nquote Sartre again, \u201cit is the non-reflective consciousness\nwhich renders the reflection [and any higher-order representation of\nit] possible\u201d (1943, 20 [1956, liii]).\n\nThere are also lines of argumentation in contemporary analytical\nphilosophy of mind that are close to and consistent with the\nphenomenological conception of prereflective self-consciousness.\nConsider for instance the following quotes from Alvin Goldman and\nHarry Frankfurt:\n\n[Consider] the case of thinking about x or attending to\nx. In the process of thinking about x there is\nalready an implicit awareness that one is thinking about x.\nThere is no need for reflection here, for taking a step back from\nthinking about x in order to examine it\u2026When we are\nthinking about x, the mind is focused on x, not on\nour thinking of x. Nevertheless, the process of thinking\nabout x carries with it a non-reflective self-awareness\n(Goldman 1970, 96).\n\n\n\nAn instance of exclusively primary and unreflexive consciousness would\nnot be an instance of what we ordinarily think of as consciousness at\nall. For what would it be like to be conscious of something without\nbeing aware of this consciousness? It would mean having an experience\nwith no awareness whatever of its occurrence. This would be,\nprecisely, a case of unconscious experience. It appears, then, that\nbeing conscious is identical with being self-conscious. Consciousness\nis self-consciousness. The claim that waking consciousness is\nself-consciousness does not mean that consciousness is invariably dual\nin the sense that every instance of it involves both a primary\nawareness and another instance of consciousness which is somehow\ndistinct and separable from the first and which has the first as its\nobject. That would threaten an intolerably infinite proliferation of\ninstances of consciousness. Rather, the self-consciousness in question\nis a sort of immanent reflexivity by virtue of which every\ninstance of being conscious grasps not only that of which it is an\nawareness but also the awareness of it. It is like a source of light\nwhich, in addition to illuminating whatever other things fall within\nits scope, renders itself visible as well (Frankfurt 1988,\n161\u2013162).\n\n\nA related view has been defended by Owen Flanagan, who not only argues\nthat consciousness involves self-consciousness in the weak sense that\nthere is something it is like for the subject to have the experience,\nbut also speaks of the low-level self-consciousness involved in\nexperiencing my experiences as mine (Flanagan 1992, 194). As Flanagan\nquite correctly points out, this primary type of self-consciousness\nshould not be confused with the much stronger notion of\nself-consciousness that is in play when we are thinking about our own\nnarrative self. The latter form of reflective self-consciousness\npresupposes both conceptual knowledge and narrative competence. It\nrequires maturation and socialization, and the ability to access and\nissue reports about the states, traits, dispositions that make one the\nperson one is. Other philosophers who have defended comparable views,\ninclude Jos\u00e9 Luis Berm\u00fadez (1998), who has argued that\nthat there are a variety of nonconceptual forms of self-consciousness\nthat are \u201clogically and ontogenetically more primitive than the\nhigher forms of self-consciousness that are usually the focus of\nphilosophical debate\u201d (1998, 274), and Uriah Kriegel (2009) who\nhas argued that there is a type of self-consciousness that is\nintrinsic to and inherent in phenomenal consciousness. We will return\nto Kriegel\u2019s self-representationalism in a section 2. Across a\nvariety of philosophical studies, then, one finds support for the\nphenomenological conception of prereflective self-consciousness.\n2. Philosophical issues and objections\n\nThe concept of prereflective self-consciousness is related to a\nvariety of philosophical issues, including epistemic asymmetry,\nimmunity to error through misidentification and the possibility of\nself-reference. Let us examine these issues in turn and also consider\nsome recent objections.\n\nIt seems clear that the objects of my visual perception are\nintersubjectively accessible in the sense that they can in principle\nbe the objects of another\u2019s perception. A subject\u2019s\nperceptual experience itself, however, is given in a unique way to the\nsubject herself. Although two people, A and B, can\nperceive a numerically identical object, they each have their own\ndistinct perceptual experience of it; just as they cannot share each\nother\u2019s pain, they cannot literally share these perceptual\nexperiences. Their experiences are epistemically asymmetrical in this\nregard. B might realize that A is in pain; he might\nsympathize with A, he might even have the same kind of pain\n(same qualitative aspects, same intensity, same proprioceptive\nlocation), but he cannot literally feel A\u2019s pain the\nsame way A does. The subject\u2019s epistemic access to her\nown experience, whether it is a pain or a perceptual experience, is\nprimarily a matter of prereflective self-consciousness. If\nsecondarily, in an act of introspective reflection I begin to examine\nmy perceptual experience, I will recognize it as my perceptual\nexperience only because I have been prereflectively aware of it, as I\nhave been living through it. Thus, phenomenology maintains, the access\nthat reflective self-consciousness has to first-order phenomenal\nexperience is routed through prereflective consciousness, for if we\nwere not prereflectively aware of our experience, our reflection on it\nwould never be motivated. When I do reflect, I reflect on something\nwith which I am already experientially familiar.\n\nThe ease with which we self-ascribe experiences is partially to be\nexplained by appeal to prereflective self-consciousness. It is\nimportant to emphasize, however, that prereflective self-consciousness\nis only a necessary and not a sufficient condition for reflective\nself-ascription and first-person knowledge. Many animals who possess\nprereflective self-consciousness obviously lack the cognitive\nresources needed for reflective self-ascriptions (see, e.g., Bekoff\n2003).\n\nWhen I experience an occurrent pain, perception, or thought, the\nexperience in question is given immediately and noninferentially. I do\nnot have to judge or appeal to some criterion in order to identify it\nas my experience. There are no free-floating experiences;\neven the experience of freely-floating belongs to someone. As William\nJames (1890) put it, all experience is \u201cpersonal.\u201d Even in\npathological cases, as in depersonalization or schizophrenic symptoms\nof delusions of control or thought insertion, a feeling or experience\nthat the subject claims not to be his is nonetheless experienced by\nhim as being part of his stream of consciousness. The complaint of\nthought insertion, for example, necessarily acknowledges that the\ninserted thoughts are thoughts that belong to the subject\u2019s\nexperience, even as the agency for such thoughts are attributed to\nothers. This first-person character entails an implicit experiential\nself-reference. If I feel hungry or see my friend, I cannot be\nmistaken about who the subject of that experience is, even if I can be\nmistaken about it being hunger (perhaps it\u2019s really thirst), or\nabout it being my friend (perhaps it\u2019s his twin), or even about\nwhether I am actually seeing him (I may be hallucinating). As\nWittgenstein (1958), Shoemaker (1968), and others have pointed out, it\nis nonsensical to ask whether I am sure that I am the one who\nfeels hungry. This is the phenomenon known as \u201cimmunity to error\nthrough misidentification relative to the first-person pronoun.\u201d\nTo this idea of immunity to error through misidentification, the\nphenomenologist adds that whether a certain experience is experienced\nas mine, or not, does not depend upon something apart from the\nexperience, but depends precisely upon the prereflective givenness\nthat belongs to the structure of the experience (Husserl 1959, 175;\nHusserl 1973a, 28, 56, 307, 443; see Zahavi 1999, 6ff.).\n\nSome philosophers who are inclined to take self-consciousness to be\nintrinsically linked to the issue of self-reference would argue that\nthe latter depends on a first-person concept. One attains\nself-consciousness only when one can conceive of oneself\nas oneself, and has the linguistic ability to use the\nfirst-person pronoun to refer to oneself (Baker 2000, 68; cf. Lowe\n2000, 264). On this view, self-consciousness is something that emerges\nin the course of a developmental process, and depends on the\nacquisition of concepts and language. Accordingly, some philosophers\ndeny that young children are capable of self-consciousness (Carruthers\n1996; Dennett 1976; Wilkes 1988; also see Flavell 1993). Evidence from\ndevelopmental psychology and ecological psychology, however, suggests\nthat there is a primitive, proprioceptive form of self-consciousness\nalready in place from\n birth.[1]\n This primitive self-awareness precedes the mastery of language and\nthe ability to form conceptually informed judgments, and it may serve\nas a basis for more advanced types of self-consciousness (see, e.g.,\nButterworth 1995, 1999; Gibson 1986; Meltzoff 1990a, 1990b; Neisser\n1988; and Stern 1985). The phenomenological view is consistent with\nsuch findings.\n\nDoes prereflective self-consciousness contain a reference to self? As\nalready mentioned, our experiential life isn\u2019t distinguished\nmerely by its qualitative features but also by its\nsubjective character. Intentional experiences are\nJanus-faced. They are of something other than the subject and\nthey are like something for the subject. When feeling a\nstomach-ache, I am not faced with a two-step process in which the\npresence of an unpleasant experience is first detected, and I then\nwonder whose experience it might be. To put it differently, in virtue\nof their self-presentational character experiences are neither\nanonymous nor impersonal, they are precisely\nfirst-personal.\n\nOn a standard metaphysical conception of the self, the self is viewed\nas an enduring substance (say a physical brain or an immaterial soul)\ndistinct from its changing experiences but capable of retaining its\nidentity across those experiences. In contrast, some phenomenologists\nhave argued that one can define a (minimal) form of selfhood in\nprocessual and experiential terms as the very first-personal mode of\nexperiencing (Zahavi 2005, 2014). The French phenomenologist Michel\nHenry argued that the most basic form of selfhood is the one\nconstituted by the very self-manifestation of experience (Henry 1963:\n581; 1965: 53), i.e., self-consciousness is not something that the\nself has, but what the self is. It is not a thing that has experiences\nbut is the very subject(ivity) of experience, which is something no\nexperience can lack, neither metaphysically nor\nphenomenologically.\n\nOn this construal, the self is something that is necessarily present\nin each experience. It is present, not as a separately existing\nentity, i.e., as something that exists independently of, in separation\nfrom or in opposition to the stream of consciousness. Nor is it given\nas an additional experiential object or as an extra experiential\ningredient, as if there were a distinct self-quale, next to and in\naddition to the quale of the smell of burnt hay or roasted almonds.\nNo, the claim is that all experiences regardless of their object and\nregardless of their attitudinal character are necessarily subjective\nor self-involving in the sense that they feel like something for\nsomeone, they necessarily involve a point of view.\n\nTo be self-aware, on this account, is not to capture a pure self or\nself-object that exists separately from the stream of experience,\nrather it is to be conscious of one\u2019s experience in its\nintrinsic first-person mode of givenness. Accordingly, we should not\nthink of the self, in this most basic sense, as a substance, or as\nsome kind of ineffable transcendental precondition, or as a social\nconstruct that gets generated through time; rather it is an integral\naspect of conscious life and involves this immediate experiential\ncharacter.\n\nAt this point it will be clarifying to compare the phenomenological\nnotion of prereflective self-consciousness with the one defended by\nBrentano. According to Brentano as I listen to a melody I am aware\nthat I am listening to it. He acknowledges that I do not have two\ndifferent mental states: my consciousness of the melody is one and the\nsame as my awareness of perceiving it; they constitute one single\npsychical phenomenon. On this point, and in opposition to higher-order\nrepresentation theories, Brentano and the phenomenologists are in\ngeneral agreement. But for Brentano, by means of this unified mental\nstate, I have an awareness of two objects: the melody and my\nperceptual experience.\n\nIn the same mental phenomenon in which the sound is present to our\nminds we simultaneously apprehend the mental phenomenon itself. What\nis more, we apprehend it in accordance with its dual nature insofar as\nit has the sound as content within it, and insofar as it has itself as\ncontent at the same time. We can say that the sound is the primary\nobject of the act of hearing, and that the act of\nhearing itself is the secondary object (Brentano 1874,\n179\u2013180 [1973, 127\u2013128]).\n\nHusserl disagrees on just this point, as do Sartre and Heidegger: my\nawareness of my experience is not an awareness of it as an\n object.[2]\n My awareness is non-objectifying in the sense that I do not occupy\nthe position or perspective of a spectator or in(tro)spector who\nattends to this experience in a thematic way. That a psychological\nstate is experienced, \u201cand is in this sense conscious, does not\nand cannot mean that this is the object of an act of consciousness, in\nthe sense that a perception, a presentation or a judgment is directed\nupon it\u201d (Husserl 1984a, 165 [2001, I, 273]). In prereflective\nself-awareness, experience is given, not as an object, but precisely\nas subjective experience. For phenomenologists, intentional experience\nis lived through (erlebt), but does not appear in an\nobjectified manner. Experience is conscious of itself without being\nthe intentional object of consciousness (Husserl 1984b, 399; Sartre\n1936, 28\u201329). The more general claim that has been made is that\nobject-consciousness necessarily entails an epistemic divide between\nthat which appears and that to whom it appears, between the object and\nthe subject of experience, and that this is why object-consciousness\nmight be singularly unsuited as a model for basic self-consciousness\n(Zahavi 1999; Legrand 2011, 207). Again, this is not meant to suggest\nthat we cannot direct our attention towards our experiences, and\nthereby take them as objects of reflection (Husserl 1984b, 424), but\nthis mode of objectifying self-consciousness has a non-objectifying\nprereflective self-consciousness as its condition of possibility.\n\nThe notion of prereflective self-consciousness is much more accepted\ntoday than it was 20 years ago and has become part of the standard\nrepertoire in philosophy of mind. The notion\u2019s increasing\npopularity not surprisingly has also led to an increasing amount of\ncriticism. One criticism that has been directed against the\nphenomenological proposal precisely turns on the alleged\nnon-objectifying character of the awareness. Uriah Kriegel has for the\npast twenty years done much to revitalize Brentano\u2019s account and\nhas defended a form of self-representationalism that can be described\nas neo-Brentanian. For Kriegel, a conscious perception of a tone is a\nmental state with a twofold representational content, it has an\noutward-directed content (the tone) and an inward-directed content\n(the perception). For that reason, prereflective self-consciousness\nmust be viewed as a species of object-consciousness, and Kriegel\nexplicitly argues that the non-objectifying alternative, or as he\nlabels it, the reference to a sui generis intrinsic glow\n(Kriegel 2009: 102), should only be considered as a last resort, since\nit remains too mysterious. It is noticeable, however, that Kriegel\nhimself eventually admits that the relationship between the inner\nawareness and what it is aware of is far more intimate that the\nstandard relationship between a representation and what it represents\n(Kriegel 2009: 107\u20138), and that self-representation consequently\nconstitutes a very unusual form of object-awareness. At that point,\none might wonder whether the difference between a highly unusual form\nof object-awareness and a non-objectifying form of awareness is all\nthat\n substantial.[3]\n\nAnother line of attack has focused on what might be called the\nuniversality question. Is it truly the case that all conscious mental\nstates involve prereflective self-consciousness, for-me-ness, or what\nis sometimes referred to as a sense of mineness or sense of ownership?\nDoes the link hold by necessity such that it characterizes all\nexperiences, however primitive or disordered they might be, or might\nit, for instance, be something that only holds true for a more limited\ngroup of experiences, say, normal, adult, experiences (Lane 2012;\nDainton 2016; Guillot 2017; Howell & Thompson 2017). Whether\ninfantile or pathological or meditative or hallucinogenic experiences\nconstitute relevant exceptions, i.e., experiences that lack\nprereflective self-consciousness, for-me-ness and sense of ownership,\nis to a large extent dependent upon how robustly one interprets these\nnotions. If prereflective self-consciousness is interpreted simply as\na non-inferential awareness of the experience one is having rather\nthan as an awareness of some self-object, and if for-me-ness and sense\nof ownership are interpreted not as involving an awareness of the\npossessive relation between oneself and the experience, but rather as\nthe distinct perspectival givenness or first-personal presence of\nexperience, it is far from obvious that there really are exceptions to\nbe\n found.[4]\n\nFinally, some critics have also claimed that the sense of ownership is\nan inflationary by-product of reflective or introspective processes\n(e.g., Berm\u00fadez 2011; 2018; Dainton 2007). They insist that\nthere is nothing like a prereflective sense of ownership that is\n\u201csomething over and above the changing stream of thought,\nperception, volition, emotion, memory, bodily sensation, and so\non\u201d (Dainton 2007, 240; emphasis added). But as should already\nbe clear, phenomenologists do not claim that prereflective\nself-consciousness or the sense of ownership is something \u201cover\nand above\u201d experience, something extra that is added as a second\nexperience. Rather, the claim is that it is an intrinsic feature of\nexperience itself. In this respect, the phenomenological claim is as\ndeflationary as the critics would want (Gallagher 2017a).\n3. Temporality and the limits of reflective self-consciousness\n\nOne advantage of the phenomenological view is that it is capable of\naccounting for some degree of diachronic unity, without having to\nposit the self as a separate entity over and above the stream of\nconsciousness. Although we live through a number of different\nexperiences, the experiencing itself remains a constant in regard to\nwhose experience it is. This is not accounted for by a substantial\nself or a mental theater. On this point Hume was right. There is no\npure or empty field of consciousness upon which the concrete\nexperiences subsequently make their entry. The field of experiencing\nis nothing apart from the specific experiences. Yet we are naturally\ninclined to distinguish the strict singularity of an experience from\nthe continuous stream of changing experiences. What remains constant\nand consistent across these changes is the sense of for-me-ness (or\nperspectival ownership) constituted by prereflective\nself-consciousness. Only a being with this sense of ownership could go\non to form concepts about herself, consider her own aims, ideals, and\naspirations as her own, construct stories about herself, and plan and\nexecute actions for which she will take responsibility.\n\nAccording to Husserl\u2019s analysis, experience of any sort\n(perception, memory, imagination, etc.) has a common temporal\nstructure such that any moment of experience contains a retentional\nreference to past moments of experience, a current openness (primal\nimpression) to what is present, and a protentional anticipation of the\nmoments of experience that are just about to happen (Husserl 1966; see\nGallagher 1998). The retentional structure of experience, that is, the\nfact that when I am experiencing something, each passing moment of\nconsciousness does not simply disappear at the next moment but is kept\nin intentional currency, constitutes a coherency that stretches over\nan experienced temporal duration. Husserl\u2019s favorite example is\na melody. When I experience a melody, I don\u2019t simply experience\na knife-edge presentation (primal impression) of one note, which is\nthen completely washed away and replaced with the next discrete\nknife-edge presentation of the next note. Rather, consciousness\nretains the sense of the first note as just past, as I hear the second\nnote, a hearing that is also enriched by an anticipation (protention)\nof the next note (or at least, in case I do not know the melody, a\nsense that there will be a next note, or some next auditory event).\nHusserl claims that we actually do perceive melodies\u2014in\nopposition to an earlier view propounded by Brentano, viz., that with\nthe help of our imagination or recollection we construct or\nreconstruct such unities out of a synthesis of mental acts. That we\nactually perceive melodies (without first constructing them using\nmemory and imagination) is possible only because consciousness is so\nstructured to allow for this temporal presentation.\n\nImportantly, the temporal (retentional-impressional-protentional)\nstructure of consciousness not only allows for the experience of\ntemporally extended objects or intentional contents, but also entails\nthe self-manifestation of consciousness, that is, its prereflective\nself-consciousness. The retention of past notes of the melody is\naccomplished, not by a \u201creal\u201d or literal re-presentation\nof the notes (as if I were hearing them a second time and\nsimultaneously with the current note), but by an intentional retaining\nof my just past experience of the melody as just past. This\nmeans that this retentional structure gives me an immediate awareness\nof my ongoing experience in the ongoing flow of experience, a\nself-awareness that is implicit in my experience of the object. At the\nsame time that I am aware of a melody, for example, I am co-aware of\nmy ongoing experience of the melody through the retentional structure\nof that very experience\u2014and this just is the prereflective\nself-consciousness of experience (see Zahavi 1999, 2003).\n\nThe temporal structure that accounts for prereflective\nself-consciousness is also the structural feature that accounts for\nthe limitations imposed on reflective self-consciousness. Reflective\nself-consciousness yields knowledge of prereflective subjectivity that\nis always after the fact. Reflective self-consciousness, which takes\nprereflective experience as its object, is itself (like any conscious\nexperience) characterized by the same temporal structure. In\nprinciple, however, the retentional-impressional-protentional\nstructure of reflection cannot overlay the\nretentional-impressional-protentional structure of prereflective\nexperience in complete simultaneity. There is always a slight delay\nbetween reflection and the prereflective object of reflection. One\nmight say that the prereflective experience must first be there if I\nam to turn my reflective attention to it and make it an object of\nreflection. Husserl writes: \u201cWhen I say I, I grasp\nmyself in a simple reflection. But this self-experience\n[Selbsterfahrung] is like every experience\n[Erfahrung], and in particular every perception, a mere\ndirecting myself towards something that was already there for me, that\nwas already conscious, but not thematically experienced, not\nnoticed\u201d (Husserl 1973b, 492\u2013493). This delay is one of\nthe reasons why there remains a difference or distance between the\nreflecting subject and the reflected object, even though the reflected\nobject is my own experience. As a reflecting subject, I never fully\ncoincide with myself.\n\nAs Merleau-Ponty puts it, our temporal existence is both a condition\nfor and an obstacle to our self-comprehension. Temporality contains an\ninternal fracture that permits us to return to our past experiences in\norder to investigate them reflectively, but this very fracture also\nprevents us from fully coinciding with ourselves. There will always\nremain a difference between the lived and the understood\n(Merleau-Ponty 1945, 76, 397, 399, 460). Self-consciousness provides\nus with the sense that we are always already in play. This leads some\nphenomenologists to note that we are born (or \u201cthrown\u201d\ninto the world) and not self-generated. We are caught up in a life\nthat is in excess of our full comprehension (Heidegger 1986). There is\nalways something about ourselves that we cannot fully capture in the\nmoment of self-conscious reflection.\n\nPervasive prereflective self-consciousness is consequently not to be\nunderstood as complete self-comprehension. One can accept the notion\nof a pervasive self-consciousness and still accept the existence of\nthe unconscious in the sense of subjective components which remain\nambiguous, obscure, and resistant to comprehension. Thus, one should\ndistinguish between the claim that consciousness is characterized by\nan immediate first-person character and the claim that consciousness\nis characterized by total self-transparency. One can easily accept the\nfirst and reject the latter (Ricoeur 1950, 354\u2013355).\n\nIf reflective self-consciousness is limited in this way, this should\nnot prevent us from exercising it in an adequate way for attaining\nmoral self-responsibility, as Husserl points out. Reflection is a\nprecondition for self-critical deliberation. If we are to subject our\ndifferent beliefs and desires to a critical, normative evaluation, it\nis not sufficient simply to have immediate first-personal access to\nthe states in question.\n\nWe take as our point of departure the essential ability for\nself-consciousness in the full sense of personal self-inspection\n(inspectio sui), and the ability that is based on this for\ntaking up positions that are reflectively directed back on oneself and\none\u2019s own life, on personal acts of self-knowledge,\nself-evaluation, and practical acts of self-determination,\nself-willing, and self-formation. (Husserl 1988, 23).\n\n\nSelf-consciousness is, therefore, not epiphenomenal. Our ability to\nmake reflective judgments about our own beliefs and desires also\nallows us to modify them.\n\nOne might see the position of Husserl, Sartre and Merleau-Ponty as\nbeing situated between two extremes. On the one hand, we have the view\nthat reflection merely copies or mirrors prereflective experience\nfaithfully, and on the other hand we have the view that reflection\ndistorts lived experience. The middle course is to recognize that\nreflection involves a gain and a loss. For Husserl, Sartre, and\nMerleau-Ponty, reflection is constrained by what is prereflectively\nlived through. It is answerable to experiential facts and is not\nconstitutively self-fulfilling. At the same time, however, they\nrecognized that reflection qua thematic self-experience does not\nsimply reproduce the lived experiences unaltered and that this is\nprecisely what makes reflection cognitively valuable. The experiences\nreflected upon are transformed in the process, to various degrees and\nmanners depending upon the type of reflection at work. Subjectivity\nconsequently seems to be constituted in such a fashion that it can\nand, at times, must relate to itself in an \u201cothering\u201d\nmanner. This self-alteration is something inherent to reflection; it\nis not something that reflection can overcome.\n4. Bodily self-awareness\n\nMuch of what we have said about self-consciousness may still seem\noverly mentalistic. It is important to note that for phenomenologists\nlike Husserl and Merleau-Ponty, pre-reflective self-awareness is both\nembodied and embedded in the world. The first-person point of view on\nthe world is never a view from nowhere; it is always defined by the\nsituation of the perceiver\u2019s body, which concerns not simply\nlocation and posture, but action in pragmatic contexts and interaction\nwith other people. Prereflective self-consciousness includes aspects\nthat are both bodily and intersubjective.\n\nThe claim is not simply that the perceiver/actor is objectively\nembodied, but that the body is in some fashion experientially present\nin the perception or action. Phenomenologists distinguish the\nprereflective body-awareness that accompanies and shapes every spatial\nexperience, from a reflective consciousness of the body. To capture\nthis difference, Husserl introduced a terminological distinction\nbetween Leib and K\u00f6rper, that is, between the\nprereflectively lived body, i.e., the body as an embodied first-person\nperspective, and the subsequent thematic experience of the\nbody as an object (Husserl 1973a, 57). Prereflective body-\n(Leib-) awareness is not a type of object-perception, but it\nis an essential element of every such perception. If I reach for a\ntool, I don\u2019t first have to find my hands; I know where to reach\nbecause I have a sense of where the tool is in relation to myself. I\nalso sense that I will be able to reach it, or that I will have to\ntake two steps towards it. My perception of the tool must involve\nproprioceptive and kinaesthetic information about my bodily situation\nand the position of my limbs, otherwise I would not be able to reach\nfor it or use it. If in such cases, we want to say that I have an\nawareness of my body, such bodily awareness is quite different from\nthe perception that I have of the tool. I may have to look or feel\naround in order to find where the tool is; but, under normal\ncircumstances, I never have to do that in regard to my body. I am\ntacitly aware, not only of where my hands and feet are, but also of\nwhat I can do with them. This tacit awareness of my body always\nregisters as an \u201cI can\u201d (or \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d\nas the case may be). Primarily, my body is experienced, not as an\nobject, but as a field of activity and affectivity, as a potentiality\nof mobility and volition, as an \u201cI do\u201d and \u201cI\ncan.\u201d\n\nThe body provides not only the egocentric spatial framework for\norientation towards the world, but also the constitutive contribution\nof its mobility. Perception does not involve a passive reception, but\nan active exploration of the environment. Husserl calls attention to\nthe importance of bodily movements (the movements of the eye,\nmanipulations by the hand, the locomotion of the body, etc.) for the\nexperience of space and spatial objects. He further claims that\nperception is correlated to and accompanied by\nproprioceptive-kinaesthetic self-sensation or self-affection (Husserl\n1973c). Every visual or tactile appearance is given in correlation to\na kinaesthetic experience. When I touch a shaped surface, it is given\nin conjunction with a sensation of finger movements. When I watch the\nflight of a bird, the moving bird is given in conjunction with the\nkinaesthetic sensations of eye movement and perhaps neck movement.\nSuch kinaesthetic activation during perception produces an implicit\nand pervasive reference to one\u2019s own body. The implicit\nself-awareness of the actual and possible movements of my body helps\nshape the experience that I have of the world. To be clear, however,\nbodily self-awareness is not an awareness of the body in isolation\nfrom the world; it is embedded in action and perception. We do not\nfirst become aware of the body and subsequently use it to engage with\nthe world. We experience the world bodily, and the body is revealed to\nus in our exploration of the world. Primarily, the body attains\nself-awareness in action (or in our dispositions to action, or in our\naction possibilities) when it relates to something, uses something, or\nmoves through the\n world.[5]\n\nBodily self-awareness, like self-consciousness more generally, has\nlimitations. I am never fully aware of everything that is going on\nwith my body. Indeed, my body tends to efface itself as I perceive and\nact in the world. When I jump to catch a ball that is thrown over my\nhead, I certainly have a sense of what I can do, but I am not aware of\nmy precise movements or postures\u2014for example, that my right leg\nbends at a certain angle as I reach with my left hand. I can execute\nmovements without being explicitly conscious of them, and even what I\nam tacitly aware of is somewhat limited\u2014for example, I am not\naware of the shape of my grasp as I reach to grab the ball. Although I\nmay not be aware of certain details about my bodily performance, this\ndoes not mean however that I am unconscious of my body. Rather it\nmeans that the way that I am aware of my body is fully integrated with\nthe intentional action that I am performing. I know that I am jumping\nto catch the ball, and implicit in that, as an immediate sense rather\nthan an inference, I experience my body jumping to catch the ball.\n\nFurthermore, experiential aspects of my embodiment permeate my\nprereflective self-consciousness. There is something it is like to\njump to catch a ball, and part of what it is like is that I am in fact\njumping. There is something different about what it is like to sit and\nimagine (or remember) myself jumping to catch the ball, and at least\npart of that difference has to do with the fact that I am sitting\nrather than jumping, although none of this may be explicit in my\nexperience.\n\nAnother way to think of the self-awareness involved in action is to\nconsider the sense of agency that is normally an aspect of\nprereflective self-consciousness in action. If, as I am walking down\nthe street, I am pushed from behind, I am instantly aware of my body\nmoving in a way that I did not intend. The fact that I feel a loss of\ncontrol over my actions suggests that there had been an implicit sense\nof agency or control in my walking prior to being pushed. In voluntary\naction, I experience the movements of my body as my own actions, and\nthis is replaced by a feeling of loss of bodily control in the case of\ninvoluntary movement. Voluntary actions feel different from\ninvoluntary actions, and this difference depends respectively, on the\nexperience of agency or the experience of a lack of agency\u2014as\nthe case may be if my body is being moved by someone\n else.[6]\n\nHubert Dreyfus has famously argued that in the case of expert\nperformance we are not self-conscious, but rather \u201cusually\ninvolved in coping in a mindless way\u201d (Dreyfus 2007a, 356). On\nhis account, our immersed bodily life is so completely and totally\nworld-engaged that it is entirely oblivious to itself. Indeed, in\ntotal absorption, one ceases being a subject altogether (Dreyfus\n2007b, 373). It is only when this bodily absorption is interrupted\nthat something like self-consciousness emerges. Dreyfus consequently\ndoesn\u2019t deny the existence of self-consciousness, but he\ndefinitely wants to see it as a capacity that is only exercised or\nactualized on special occasions. Moreover, when this capacity is\nexercised it necessarily disrupts our coping and radically transform\nthe kind of affordances that are given to it (Dreyfus 2005, 61; 2007,\n354). A number of theorists, however, have taken issue with this\ncharacterization of expert performance and have argued that in the\nperforming arts (e.g., in dance, musical performance) and in athletics\n(e.g., baseball, cricket) expert performers may employ an enhanced but\nstill prereflective awareness (Legrand 2007), a heedful consciousness\nof the situation (e.g., Sutton et al. 2011), or even a skillful\nreflective monitoring (Montero 2010; 2014), or some variable\ncombination of these (H\u00f8ffding 2018), and that such\nconsciousness does not impede performance but improves it.\n\nBodily self-awareness is not influenced only by action-oriented\nmovement or motor control processes; it is also modulated by various\naffective (emotional), autonomic and interoceptive processes that are\ncontingent on current bodily states and closely related to\nenvironmental variations. What Dainton (2007) calls background\nsensations, as well as what Matthew Ratcliffe (2008) calls existential\nfeelings, are part of a mix of sensory processes that can provide what\nWilliam James (1890) terms the \u201cwarmth and intimacy\u201d of\nbodily sensations, or what Thomas Fuchs (2013) calls \u201cthe\nfeeling of being alive.\u201d\n5. Intersubjective and social forms of self-consciousness\n\nA focus on embodied self-experience inevitably leads to a decisive\nwidening of the discussion. The externality of embodiment puts me, and\nmy actions, in the public sphere. Self-consciousness, which involves\nan ability to make reflective judgments about our own beliefs and\ndesires, is always shaped by others and what we have learned from\nothers. This intersubjective or social influence can also affect\nprereflective self-consciousness, including my sense of embodied\nagency.\n\nI can become aware of myself through the eyes of other people, and\nthis can happen in several different ways. Thus, embodiment brings\nintersubjectivity and sociality into the picture, and draws attention\nto the question of how certain forms of self-consciousness are\nintersubjectively mediated or how they may depend on one\u2019s\nsocial relations to others. My awareness of myself as one person among\nothers, an awareness that I may frame from the perspective of others,\nattempting to see myself as they see me, involves a change in the\nattitude of self-consciousness. Within this attitude, judgments that I\nmake about myself are constrained by social expectations and cultural\nvalues. This kind of social self-consciousness is always\ncontextualized, as I try to understand how I appear to others, both in\nthe way I look, and in the meaning of my actions. I find myself in\nparticular contexts, with specific capabilities and dispositions,\nhabits and convictions, and I express myself in a way that is\nreflected off of others, in relevant (socially defined) roles through\nmy language and my actions.\n\nThe role of the other in this mode of self-consciousness is not\nunessential. According to Husserl, I become aware of myself\nspecifically as a human person only in such intersubjective relations\n(Husserl 1973b, 175; 1952, 204\u201305; see Hart 1992, 71; Zahavi\n1999, 157ff. Also see Taylor 1989, 34\u201336 for a similar idea).\nThus Husserl distinguishes the subject taken in its bare formality\nfrom the personalized subject and claims that the origin and status of\nbeing a person must be located in the social dimension. I am a person,\nsocially contextualized, with abilities, dispositions, habits,\ninterests, character traits, and convictions, all of which have been\ndeveloped through my interactions with others. When considering the\nfullness of human selfhood, the idea of an isolated, pure and formal\nsubject of experience is an abstraction (Husserl 1968, 210). Given the\nright conditions and circumstances, the self acquires a personalizing\nself-apprehension, i.e., it develops into a person and as a person\n(cf. Husserl 1952, 265). And this development depends heavily upon\nsocial interaction (Husserl 1973b, 170\u2013171).\n\nThis kind of self-consciousness also opens up the possibility of\nself-alienation, famously explicated by Sartre in terms of the\nother\u2019s gaze. For Sartre, because \u201cour being, along with\nits being-for-itself, is also for-others; the being which is revealed\nto the reflective consciousness is for-itself-for-others\u201d (1956,\n282). On this view, the primary experience of the other is not that I\nperceive her as some kind of object in which I must find a person, but\nI perceive the other as a subject who perceives me as an object. My\nexperience of the other is at the same time an experience that\ninvolves my own self-consciousness, a self-consciousness in which I am\nprereflectively aware that I am an object for another. This experience\ncan further motivate a reflective self-consciousness as I consider how\nI must appear to the other.\n\nMerleau-Ponty (1945, 415) suggests that the other\u2019s gaze can\nmotivate this kind of self-consciousness only if I already have a\nsense of my own visibility to the other. This sense of my own\nvisibility, however, is immediately linked with the prereflective,\nproprioceptive-kinaesthetic sense of my body, an insight that goes\nback to Husserl\u2019s analysis (mentioned above). Merleau-Ponty\nnotes its connection to the infant\u2019s capability for imitation,\nand this is carried forward to more recent advances in developmental\npsychology (see Merleau-Ponty, 1945, 165, 404\u2013405; 2010;\nGallagher and Zahavi 2021; Zahavi 1999, 171\u201372). Indeed,\nalthough much emphasis has fallen on vision and the gaze of the other\nin phenomenological accounts of self-consciousness, proprioceptive and\ntactile experiences have a developmental primacy and emerge in the\npre-natal environment in ways that allow for very basic relational\nexperiences of self-movement versus movement of the mother\u2019s\nbody (Lymer 2010; 2014; Ciaunica & Crucianelli 2019; Ciaunica\n& Fotopoulou 2016), and continue to play a significant role in\nembodied interactions with caregivers during early infancy. In this\nrespect, the claim is that intersubjective/intercorporeal experiences\ncan affect prereflective self-consciousness Kyselo 2016; Ratcliffe\n2017). This complicates any claim that the prereflective experience of\nbody ownership is primarily for self-preservation (Ciaunica &\nCrucianelli 2019; de Vignemont 2018).\n\nThis is not the place to enter into a detailed discussion of these\nrich and complex issues, issues that extend to analyses of phenomena\nsuch as empathy, shame, guilt, and so on (see Zahavi 2010, 2014). But\nit is important to realize that self-consciousness is a multifaceted\nconcept. It is not something that can be exhaustively analyzed simply\nby examining the inner workings of the mind.\n6. Conclusion\n\nThe notion of self-consciousness has been the subject of a rich and\ncomplex analysis in the phenomenological tradition. Aspects of the\nphenomenological analysis also show up in other areas of research,\nincluding feminism (Stawarska 2006; Young 2005; Hein\u00e4maa 2003),\necological psychology (Gibson 1966), and recent analyses of enactive\nperception (Gallagher 2017b; No\u00eb 2004; Thompson 2008). The\nrecognition of the existence of a primitive form of prereflective\nself-consciousness is an important starting point for an understanding\nof more elaborate forms of self-consciousness that are concept- and\nlanguage-dependent. Phenomenological analyses show these processes to\nbe more than purely mental or cognitive events since they integrally\ninvolve embodiment and intersubjective dimensions.\n",
