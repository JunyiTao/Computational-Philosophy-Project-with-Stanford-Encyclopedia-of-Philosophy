    "main_text": "Normative Accounts, Content-Directed || Norms of assertion\n5.1 Norms of assertion\n\nMost of the discussion on assertion during the past twenty years has\nconcerned norms of assertability. Simply put, philosophers aim to\ndetermine under which conditions it is epistemically permissible (or\nproper, warranted, correct, appropriate) to make an assertion.\n5.1.1 Modern approaches: correctness and warranted assertability\n\nPhilosophers have long been interested in analyzing what we mean when\nwe characterize an assertion as \u201ccorrect\u201d,\n\u201cjustified\u201d, \u201cproper\u201d,\n\u201cwarranted\u201d, \u201cassertible\u201d, or\n\u201cwarrantedly assertible\u201d. The latter notion was taken on\nboard in pragmatism, and in later forms of anti-realism. Dewey (1938)\nseems to have been the first to characterize truth in terms of\nassertoric correctness, with his notion of warranted\nassertibility, even though this idea had a clear affinity with\nthe verifiability principle of Moritz Schlick (1936). Dewey, following\nPeirce, regarded truth as the ideal limit of scientific inquiry (1938:\n345), and a proposition warrantedly asserted only when known\nin virtue of such an inquiry. Warranted assertibility is the property\nof a proposition for which such knowledge potentially exists\n(1938: 9). Dewey was later followed by, notably, Dummett (1976) and\nPutnam (1981). Common to them is the position that there cannot be\nanything more to truth than being supported by the best available\nevidence. In these early discussions, the strategy was that of getting\na handle on truth by means of an appeal to the notion of the\ncorrectness of an assertion, which was taken as more fundamental. On\nDummett\u2019s view, we do get a notion of truth distinct\nfrom the notion of a correct assertion only because of the\nsemantics of compound sentences (1976: 50\u201352). The\nquestion of what the correctness of an assertion consists in was not\nitself much discussed in earlier work, but became subject of\ndiscussion already in the 1980s, with the work of Boghossian and\nothers.\n5.1.2 Contemporary approaches: the norm of assertion\n\nThe contemporary wave of discussion about assertoric normativity is\nalmost exclusively content-directed; the norms concern the epistemic\nrelation between the speaker and the content of their\n assertion.[18]\n Williamson (1996, 2000) initiated this debate by proposing that\nassertion is governed by a single norm, of the format:\n\n(N)\nOne must: assert p only if p has\nC.\n\n\nAccording to this hypothesis, you are entitled to assert a proposition\nonly if that proposition has a certain unspecified property\nC. The (N)-schema formalizes the key philosophical question\nabout assertability: which epistemic property C that makes a\nproposition assertable?\n\nWilliamson\u2019s answer is that property C must be\nknowledge, i.e., being known by the speaker. If this is\nright, you can properly assert only what you know: assertion is\ngoverned by the knowledge-norm\n (KNA):\n\n(KNA)\nOne must: assert p only if one knows p.\n\n\n(Williamson 2000: 243). (KNA) is proposed as part of an account of\nassertion. Other norms have been proposed: the most prominent\nalternatives are the truth norm (TNA), the justification norm (JNA)\nand the belief norm (BNA):\n\n(TNA)\nOne must: assert p only if p.\n(JNA)\nOne must: assert p only if one is epistemically justified\nin believing p.\n(BNA)\nOne must: assert p only if one believes p.\n\n\nDetermining which of these norms governs assertion depends (at least\nin part) on what we mean by hypothesizing that assertion is governed\nby a simple norm by N. In the next section\n (5.1.3),\n we clarify what philosophers typically mean when they say that\nN governs assertions. In the subsequent section\n (5.1.4),\n we review the various accounts of which specific norm governs\nassertion (i.e., the different views as to which property\nC makes a proposition assertable).\n5.1.3 What kind of norm?\n\nWilliamson\u2019s initial framing of the debate on the norm of\nassertion takes for granted a number of assumptions: for instance,\nthat there is a single norm, that it is constitutive of assertion,\nthat all and only assertions are subject to it. In subsequent work,\nsome of these assumptions have been questioned. Here we limit\nourselves to list each assumption (ignoring the numerous objections\nthat affect them). The interested reader will find a discussion of the\ncase for and against each assumption in the supplementary document\n Which Kind of Norm?.\n\n(A1)\nSpecificity: N applies specifically to\nassertion: only assertions are subject to N.\n(A1*)\nDirectness: Assertions are subject to N\ndirectly, qua assertions.\n\n\nBy Specificity, N is a norm that regulates only one\nspecies of action: asserting. In this sense, it is specific to\nassertion. It governs the making of assertions in general, and nothing\nelse. Directness is closely connected to\nSpecificity. It clarifies that assertions are subject to\nN only in virtue of the fact that they are assertions.\n\n(A2)\nUniqueness: There is only one norm of assertion:\nassertion is only subject to N\n(A2*)\nIndirectness: Assertions are subject to other normative\nstandards, but only indirectly (not in virtue of the fact that they\nare assertions).\n\n\nThe \u201cuniqueness assumption\u201d holds that assertion is\nsubject to a single norm. Indirectness specifies that\nUniqueness is compatible with recognizing that there are\nother norms that apply to assertion, albeit only indirectly\n(Williamson 1996: 489). For instance, an assertion can follow\nN (e.g., satisfy the Justification Norm JNA) and violate\nstandard of politeness, morality, legality, etc. Unlike N,\nthese other normative standards are not specific to assertion, since\nthey apply also to other actions (questions, orders, as well as\nnon-linguistic actions).\n\nAn important corollary of Indirectness is that whether an\nassertion is all-things-considered permissible or not may depend on\nfactors that are independent of N. When you say something\noffensive, or reveal a secret that you agreed to keep, you may follow\nN and yet make an (all-things-considered) impermissible\nassertion. And when you lie to save a life, you may violate N\nand make an assertion that is (all-things-considered) permissible.\n\n(A3)\nIndividuation: N uniquely identifies assertion:\nassertion is the only speech act that is only subject to\nN.\n\n\nAccording to the Individuation assumption, the norm of\nassertion is individuating: assertion can be defined as the unique\nspeech act who is subject to this unique norm (Williamson 2000: 241;\nGoldberg 2015: 25; Montminy 2013a). It should be emphasized here that\nit is being subject to the norm that characterizes assertion,\nnot conforming to the norm. An assertion that violates the\nnorm is still an assertion. A definition of assertion in terms of its\nnorm would read as:\n\n(D)\nS asserts that p iff in saying p,\nS is subject to the obligation imposed by N.\n\n\nIf\n (A3)\n holds, an important motivation for identifying N is that it\nwill provide us with a definition of assertion. Once we determine what\nN is (say, JNA), we can disambiguate the content of this\ndefinition (say, \u201cthe only speech act who is only subject to\nJNA\u201d).\n\n(A4)\nEssentiality: Being subject to N is essential to\nassertion as an action type: Necessarily, assertion is subject to\nN.\n\n\nThe Essentiality assumption goes beyond\nIndividuation: Individuation allows that assertion\nis only actually individuated by N, and that it could have\nbeen governed by some other norm. By contrast,\n (A4)\n holds that assertions could not exist and be governed by a different\nnorm: if assertion were subject to a different norm, it would be a\ndifferent speech act. Nothing but an assertion could violate the norm,\nif the\n (A3)\n and\n (A4)\n properties hold.\n\n(A5)\nPermissibility: N establishes a condition for\npermissible assertion: p is permissible to assert only if\np meets C.\n\n\nBy\n (A5),\n an assertion is permissible (appropriate, epistemically proper,\nwarranted, correct\u2014depending on one\u2019s favorite\nterminology) only if it meets condition C, and impermissible\nif it does not meet C. Permission is related to the negative\nevaluation of assertions: assertions who violate N are\nprima facie faulty, and criticizable (qua violations of\nN). Permissibility only establishes what is\nnecessary for permissible assertion, not what is\n sufficient.[19]\n\nMost theorists take for granted that N is the\n\u201cconstitutive\u201d norm of assertion, and some explicitly\nadvocate\n (A6).[20]\n\n(A6)\nConstitutivity: N is the constitutive norm of\nassertion.\n\n\nHowever, there is substantial (and often unacknowledged) disagreement\nabout what constitutivity amounts to (for more the debate surrounding\neach of these assumptions, see the supplementary document\n Which Kind of Norm?).\n5.1.4 Which Norm of Assertion?\n\nFor the most part, the literature on norms of assertion has concerned\nthe question of which specific norm governs assertion, and\nwhat are the reasons for favoring one candidate norm over another.\nBelow, we briefly go through the main candidates from the\nliterature.\nThe knowledge norm\n\n(KNA)\nOne must: assert p only if one knows p.\n\n\nOver and above Williamson,\n (KNA)\n has been favored by DeRose (2002), Reynolds (2002), Adler (2002:\n275), Hawthorne (2004), Stanley (2005), Engel (2008), Schaffer (2008),\nand Turri (2010), among others.\n\nIn addition to direct intuitions about the appropriateness of specific\nsentences, proponents of the knowledge norm have adduced indirect\nevidence in the form of intuitions about conversational patterns,\nclaiming that these patterns are best explained by the acceptance of\nthe knowledge norm. Williamson himself appeals to such patterns, such\nas those arising from Moorean Assertions\n (26),\n Lottery Assertions\n (27),\n and Challenges\n (28):\n\n(26)\nIt is raining, but I don\u2019t know that it is raining.\n(27)\nYour ticket did not win.\n(28)\nHow do you know that?\n\n\nConcerning the first, Williamson (2000: 253) claims that an utterance\nof\n (26)\n is just as odd as any ordinary Moorean sentence involving belief,\nsuch as\n (25)\n above. The oddity of\n (26)\n can be explained by appeal to the knowledge norm, and this is taken\nby supporters of\n (KNA)\n to be a datum in its favor. By\n (KNA),\n (26) is proper only if the speaker knows that the proposition\nexpressed by\n (26)\n is true. Since knowledge distributes over conjunction, this means\nthat the speaker should know that it is raining and also that she does\nnot know that it is raining. Since knowledge is factive, this\ngenerates a contradiction: it follows that an assertion of\n (26)\n cannot be proper, and this explains its oddity.\n\nSimilarly,\n (KNA)\n seems well positioned to explain the oddity of asserting\n (27)\n merely on probabilistic grounds. Suppose that a (fair) lottery with a\nlarge number of tickets has been held; only one ticket has won.\nB has a ticket, but neither A nor B knows\nthe result. A asserts\n (27)\n on merely probabilistic grounds. Although the probability that the\nticket has won is very low (and one can get it arbitrarily low, short\nof zero, by increasing the number of tickets in the lottery), it is\nintuitively incorrect for A to tell\n (27)\n to B (Williamson 2000: 246\u2013249). No probability short\nof 1 seems to authorize A\u2019s utterance of\n (27).\n Since A does not know that\n (27)\n is true,\n (KNA)\n explains the unacceptability of A\u2019s utterance.\n\nFinally, in standard contexts, it is perfectly appropriate to\nchallenge an assertion with questions like\n (28),\n but\n (28)\n presupposes that the speaker knows that what she says is true.\n (KNA)\n is well positioned to explain why this presupposition is appropriate:\nif speakers are only entitled to assert what they know, then it is\nwithin the hearer\u2019s conversational rights to assume (and\npresuppose) that the speaker knows that what they say is true. Further\nconversational patterns supporting\n (KNA)\n have been proposed, e.g., by Benton (2011).\n\nThe claim that\n (KNA)\n is supported by these conversational patterns has been extensively\ncriticized. The most common line is that the available data can be\nexplained equally well (if not better) by competing accounts. For\ninstance, several authors argue that the oddity of Moorean Assertions\nand Lottery Assertions can be explained by appeal to a justification\n norm.[21]\n Others have noted that these conversational patterns may be explained\nby appealing to more general principles, rather than assertoric norms\nspecifically. For instance, it has been argued that Lottery Assertions\nand Moorean Assertions are improper because they violate more general\n(Gricean) conversational\n principles.[22]\n\nA different criticism comes from Sosa (2009), who notes that\n (KNA)\u2019s\n explanation of Moorean assertions fails to generalize as it should,\nbecause\n (KNA)\n is unable to explain \u201cdubious assertions\u201d: cases in which\nthe speaker asserts p while admitting that he doesn\u2019t\nknow whether he knows that p (but see Benton 2013, Montminy\n2013a). Finally, several authors have questioned the assumption that\nit is always improper to assert that one\u2019s ticket is a loser on\npurely probabilistic\n grounds.[23]\n\nThe argument from challenges like\n (28)\n is surely the least compelling. First, to meet the challenge raised\nby\n (28),\n it would be sufficient for the speaker to show that she has good\nreasons to believe that what she said is true (Lackey 2007:\n610; Kvanvig 2009: 143; McKinnon & Turri 2013). It does not seem,\nby contrast, that the speaker has to prove that she knows (rather than\nmerely believe) that what she said is true. Second, taking the\nargument seriously proves too much. Consider\n (29):\n\n(29)\nAre you sure?\n(30)\nHow can you be certain?\n\n\nSince\n (29)\n and\n (30)\n are also natural ways to challenge an assertion, by the same logic,\nwe should conclude that assertion is also governed by a certainty\nrule. We could extend this to other challenges (Is that true?). So the\nchallenge argument doesn\u2019t seem to show a primacy of knowledge\nover alternative rules.\n\nA general problem with the appeal to conversational patterns is that\nthey don\u2019t seem to favor specifically normative views over\ncorresponding non-normative views. For instance, it appears that any\nlinguistic phenomenon that can be explained by appeal to a knowledge\nnorm can be equally well explained by appeal to the view that\nasserters represent themselves as knowing what they say, although\nthere is no norm (cf. Pagin 2016b; D. Black 2018). Combine this with\nextraneous, non-assertion-specific norms. That A\u2019s lottery\nassertion\n (27)\n is bad can then be explained by appeal to self-representation of\nknowledge, together with the general moral norm that it is wrong to\nmislead hearers.\n\nMany objections against\n (KNA)\n are based on the idea that its requirements are too strong. First,\nGettiered assertions. Suppose that you have a justified true\nbelief that falls short of knowledge. For instance, you walk into a\ncaf\u00e9, look at the clock, and conclude that it\u2019s 4.35; but\nyour belief is only accidentally true because (unbeknownst to you) the\nclock has been stuck at 4.35 for several days. If someone asks you the\ntime, it seems perfectly appropriate for you to respond \u201c4.35\npm\u201d. However, by making such an assertion, you would be\nviolating\n (KNA),\n which intuitively speaks against it (Lackey 2007: 596; Kvanvig 2009:\n146\u20137; Coffman 2014: 36).\n\nSimilar objections arise in relation to the intuitive permissibility\nof unlucky assertions: assertions that you have excellent\nreasons to believe to be true, but that happen to be false. Since the\nproblem with unlucky assertions is that\n (KNA)\n entails\n (TNA)\n (it only allows true assertions), we will discuss it below, as we\nconsider objections to\n (TNA).\n\nLackey objects that\n (KNA)\n fails to accommodate selfless assertions. She presents\nseveral examples: one involves a teacher, Stella, who firmly believes\nin creationism, but is aware that the scientific consensus is that\nhumans evolved from apes. Stella recognizes that Darwinism is\nsupported by stronger empirical evidence, but this is not enough to\nshake her firm belief in creationism. Suppose that she tells her\nstudents:\n\n(31)\nHomo sapiens evolved from Homo erectus.\n\n\nIntuitively, it would be appropriate for Stella, as a teacher, to\nassert\n (31).\n However,\n (KNA)\n predicts that\n (31)\n is incorrect, because Stella does not believe, and therefore does not\nknow, that\n (31)\n is true. Selfless assertion have generated a lively debate, mostly\ninvolving attempts to explain their propriety within a\n (KNA)-framework\n (see Montminy 2013a, Turri 2015, Mili\u0107 2017).\n\nFurther objections concern so-called unsafe assertions, where\nthe speaker does know what is asserted, but would easily have made the\nassertion in a similar situation without\n knowledge.[24]\n\nA few authors who sympathize with\n (KNA)\n have emphasized the role of the hearer. Their proposals are similar\nto\n (KNA),\n but set the condition in relation to the transmission of knowledge to\nthe hearer. An example is Garc\u00eda-Carpintero (2004:\n156):\n\n(KNA-T)\nOne must: assert p only if one\u2019s audience comes\nthereby to be in a position to know that p.\n\n\nSimilar norms have also been proposed by Pelling (2013a) and by\nHinchman (2013). Garc\u00eda-Carpintero suggests that his version is\npreferable to Williamson\u2019s because it brings out the social,\ncommunicative function of language (but see Willard-Kyle forthcoming\nfor objections to KNA-T).\n[25]\nThe truth norm\n\nMost alternatives to the knowledge norm that are weaker than\n (KNA):\n they require less than knowledge for proper assertion. Weiner (2005)\nand Whiting (2013, 2015) propose a truth norm (cf. also Alston\n2000):\n\n(TNA)\nAssert that p only if p is true.\n\n\nJust like the knowledge norm, the truth norm is factive: both entail\nthat you can assert a proposition only if it is true. This generates a\nproblem concerning the intuitive appropriateness of unlucky\nassertions. To illustrate, imagine that you have had a cat for\nseveral years. During a conversation, a friend asks you if you have\nany pets at home, and you reply:\n\n(32)\nI have a cat at home.\n\n\nUnbeknownst to you, however, some thieves broke into your house and\nstole everything you have, including your cat. Since you could not\npossibly have foreseen the eventuality of such an absurd theft, it\nseems that your assertion is appropriate: in response to your\nfriend\u2019s question,\n (32)\n is simply the right thing to say. However,\n (KNA)\n and\n (TNA)\n give a different verdict: they predict that\n (32)\n is an inappropriate response. What\u2019s more,\n (TNA)\n (but not\n (KNA))\n predicts that the appropriate reply would have been to assert the\nnegation of\n (32),\n namely that you don\u2019t have a cat at home. But again, such a\n\u201clucky assertion\u201d would be intuitively inappropriate:\nsince you have no reason to believe that your cat was stolen, in\nsaying that you don\u2019t have a pet you would be\n lying.[26]\n\nProponents of\n (KNA)\n and\n (TNA)\n tend to concede that unlucky assertions (and Gettiered\nassertions) are intuitively appropriate, and that lucky assertions are\nintuitively inappropriate. Their standard defense strategy is to\ninvoke some distinctions that explain away their incorrect\npredictions. Williamson (2000: 256\u2013257) suggests that making\nunlucky and Gettiered assertions is reasonable, and this is why\nassertions like\n (32)\n usually don\u2019t warrant criticism. However, here the prediction\nthat uttering\n (32)\n is reasonable is made by general observations about rationality, and\nnot by\n (KNA)\n itself. If\n (KNA)\u2019s\n job is to tell us which assertions are appropriate and which are not,\nit is not clear how these observations really help its case, since\nthere are other norms (such as\n (JNA))\n that are able to make this prediction without appeal to independent\nepistemic standards.\n\nA parallel solution has been delineated by DeRose, who draws a\ndistinction between primary and secondary propriety. Primary\npropriety is just what a rule says: when a rule prescribes to\nf only if C, it is primarily proper to f if\nC, and primarily improper to f if not C.\nSecondary propriety is dictated by whether you have reasons to think\nyou are following the rule. If you f because you reasonably\nbelieve that C, but C is accidentally false, your\naction is primarily improper but secondarily proper, and doesn\u2019t\ndeserve blame. If you f although you reasonably believe that\nC is false, but C is accidentally true, your\nassertion is primarily proper but secondarily improper, and\ndoesn\u2019t deserve praise. This strategy helps defend\n (TNA)\n and\n (KNA)\n against the devised counterexamples. Unlucky and Gettiered assertions\nare primarily improper but secondarily proper, and that\u2019s why\nthey don\u2019t deserve blame. Lucky assertions are primarily proper\nbut secondarily improper, and that\u2019s why they don\u2019t\ndeserve praise.\n\nSeveral authors reject this distinction between primary and secondary\n propriety.[27]\n Most of them think that this distinction is spurious. If the job of\nan epistemic norm is to identify the one epistemic standard C\nfrom which it is appropriate to assert, then it is not clear that\nappealing to secondary propriety, epistemic excuses or reasonableness\nis a legitimate move, given that more economic alternatives are\navailable. Reasonably thinking that you are in C (secondarily\nfollowing the rule) is itself an epistemic state; if being in such a\nstate epistemically entitles you to assert, such permissibility should\nbe built into the\n norm.[28]\n\nAccepting the distinction between primary and secondary propriety\ninduces a problem for the intuitive support for the various theories.\nA large part of the intuitions that serve to support one or the other\nnorm theory relies on raw intuitions about what one should or\nshouldn\u2019t assert in some situation, or what is proper or\nimproper to assert there. If there are several ways an assertion can\nbe proper or improper, then it is not easy to see which concept of\npropriety is being tracked by these intuitions. The idea is that a\nparticular intuition that seems to disconfirm a particular normative\ntheory can be explained away by saying that it does not in fact track\nthe primary propriety, but instead only some secondary propriety.\nSince intuitions don\u2019t come labeled as \u201cprimary\u201d and\n\u201csecondary\u201d, there is a risk of a substantial\nunderdetermination of theory by data (stressed by Pagin 2016b): two\ntheorists need not agree about whether or not an intuition about a\nparticular case supports a certain theory.\n\nA problem persists even if we reject the primary/secondary\ndistinction. As noted, everyone agrees that assertions are governed by\nvarious norms: moral, prudential, conversational, rules of etiquette.\nWhen does an intuition track the intended notion of a proper\nassertion, and when something else altogether? Kvanvig (2011: 235) and\nEngel (2008: 52\u201354) have drawn attention to this. According to\nKvanvig, intuitions typically concern whether assertions are\nall-things-considered appropriate. But an assertion may be\n\u201call-things-considered appropriate\u201d without being\n\u201cepistemic appropriate\u201d (or the other way around). Since\nwe do not have a reliable method for telling apart intuitions about\n\u201coverall appropriateness\u201d from intuitions about\n\u201cepistemic appropriateness\u201d, it is often unclear to which\nextent a given set of intuitions supports or undermines a given theory\n(cf. Hawthorne & Stanley 2008: 585\u20136). To address this\nproblem, Greenberg (forthcoming) proposes to reframe the debate in\nterms of epistemic norms constraining action, rather than\nassertion.\n\nComplex refinements of\n (TNA)\n have been proposed, too. MacFarlane (2014: 103) adopts a truth norm,\nbut requires it to be qualified as being reflective. This\nmeans, in the context of MacFarlane\u2019s relativism, that\nthe proposition should be true in the context of utterance, as\nassessed from the same context of\n utterance.[29]\n According to MacFarlane, the truth norm needs to be complemented by a\nretraction rule that enjoins the speaker to retract the\nassertion if it turns out not be true (cf. Dummett 1991: 165), in a\ncontext of assessment:\n\n(RNA)\nRetract an (unretracted) assertion if it turns out not to be\ntrue.\n\n\nThis rule is also stated in the context of MacFarlane\u2019s\nrelativism, with respect to a context of use and a context of\nassessment. According to the resulting view, assertion is governed\njointly by the (reflective) truth norm and the retraction rule.\nRescorla (2009a), who defends a commitment account of assertion (see\n section 6.1),\n argues there is no norm at all for proper making of\nassertions. There are only norms that govern later reactions. He\nproposes three alternatives to\n (RNA),\n which share the idea that when a speaker is challenged with respect\nto an assertion he has made, he must either defend the assertion or\nelse retract it (Rescorla 2009a: 103\u2013105; cf. Rescorla\n2009b).\nThe justification norms\n\nSeveral authors have argued that assertability requires justification,\nrather than belief or knowledge. A standard formulation would be:\n\n(JNA)\nAssert only that for which you have proper justification.\n\n\nWhat \u201cjustification\u201d is taken to refer to varies between\nauthors. Douven (2006, 2009) and Lackey (2007, 2008) argue for a norm\nof rational belief. Note that\n (JNA)\n does not require that you believe what you say: all that it\nrequires is that it is (or would be) rational for you to\nbelieve it. As such,\n (JNA)\n classifies selfless assertions (which are disbelieved, but\nrational to believe) as appropriate, a prediction that Lackey (2007)\ntakes to be a crucial advantage of\n (JNA).\n\nDifferent conversational contexts may require different degrees of\njustification. For instance, suppose that you are serving your friend\na curry that you just defrosted. You remember that you prepared it for\na vegan dinner over a month ago, but you\u2019re not absolutely sure.\nIf your friend has a mild dislike for cheese,\n (33)\n may be an appropriate thing to say; not so much if your friend has a\ndeadly allergy to lactose:\n\n(33)\nThere is no cheese in this curry.\n\n\nTo accommodate this sort of intuitions, some authors have proposed\ncontext-sensitive versions of\n (JNA).\n Gerken (2012, 2014, 2017) says that an assertion must be based\n\u201con a degree of discursive justification for believing that\np that is adequate\u201d relative to the conversational\ncontext. He also argues that the notion of justification is best\nunderstood in internalist terms: a speaker asserting p is\njustified only if they would be able to consciously articulate their\nreasons in support of p. McKinnon (2013, 2015) also defends a\nversion of\n (JNA)\n that is context-sensitive. She argues that one may assert that\np only if (i) the speaker has supportive reasons for\np, and (ii) the relevant conventional and pragmatic elements\nof the context of assertion are present. On this view, the pragmatic\nfeatures of the context have an effect on which epistemic support is\nneeded. Pragmatic features can regard the stakes involved\n(how much depends practically on the truth of what is asserted) or\npedagogical requirements (in case the speaker is a teacher\nwho is required to teach what is rational to believe; McKinnon 2015:\nSection 4.4).\n\nIf justification comes in degrees, perhaps some propositions are more\nassertable than others. According to an influential view (Jackson\n1974, 565, cf. Lewis 1976, 297), the degree to which a proposition is\nassertable is a function of its probability. But Sam Carter\n(forthcoming) shows that this view makes systematically incorrect\npredictions. He suggests that assertability is a matter of\nnormality instead: \u201casserting p is more\nappropriate than asserting q, for a speaker in evidential\nstate E, iff amongst the worlds compatible with E, p is more\nnormal than q\u201d (in turn, normality has to do with what\nis compatible with our evidence-based expectations; cf. Carter\nforthcoming: \u00a75 for a formal definition).\n\n(JNA)\n does not explicitly forbid insincere assertions (assertions that are\nbelieved to be false). Some find this feature unattractive, and prefer\nto amend\n (JNA)\n so as to introduce a belief-requirement, as in\n (JBNA):\n\n(JBNA)\nAssert that p only if you justifiably believe that\np.\n\n\nSince\n (JBNA)\n requires both justification and belief, it entails that both\n (JNA)\n and\n (BNA)\n are true. But how should we characterize justification for\nthe purpose of this more demanding norm? For Kvanvig (2009, 2011), the\nrelevant notion is knowledge-level justification: \u201cthe kind [of\njustification] that is sufficient for knowledge in the presence of\nungettiered true belief\u201d (2009: 156); a stronger version of this\nrequirement (would-be-knowledge) is defended by Coffman (2014).\n\nA datum that justification rules may have trouble explaining is the\nwrongness of false assertions. There seems to be something inherently\ndefective about false assertions, and there is clearly a sense in\nwhich true, justified assertions are more valuable than false, equally\njustified ones. But\n (JNA)\n and\n (JBNA)\n have no resources to explain what is defective about falsity. In\nresponse, Marsili (2018) notes that proponents of non-factive accounts\ncan avail themselves of the notion of an assertion\u2019s aim: when\nwe make an assertion, we purport to describe the world as it is; our\nassertion\u2019s purported goal is met only if the assertion is true.\nOn this view, false assertions are not impermissible, but are still\ndefective, because they fail to meet their purported aim.\n\nThere are views that come very close to justification rules. Maitra\nand Weatherson (2010: 112) propose what they call The Evidence\nResponsiveness Rule: that one assert that p only if\none\u2019s attitude towards p is properly responsive to the\nevidence (they also propose to complement it with an action\nrule, that it is proper to assert that p only if acting\nas if p is \u201cthe thing for you to do\u201d). Smithies\n(2012) defends the view that p is assertable only if you have\na justification to believe that you are in a position to know that\np (cf. Koethe 2009, Rosenkranz forthcoming). This version of\n (JNA)\n restores a guiding normative role for knowledge, while accommodating\nmany of the intuitions that motivate a preference for\n (JNA)\n or\n (KNA)\n (for a critique, see M. Smith 2012).\nOther proposals\n\nBelief norms are the weakest norms on the market:\n\n(BNA)\nAssert only what you believe.\n\n\nThe belief norm is explicitly stated by Hindriks (2007) and Bach\n(2008: 77). If one substitutes \u2018say\u2019 for\n\u2018assert\u2019, this is close to a reformulations of\nGrice\u2019s second submaxim of Quality (\u201cDo not say what you\nbelieve to be false\u201d (Grice 1989: 27).\n\nIntuitively,\n (BNA)\n is too permissive: it allows us to assert whatever we believe, even\nif we have no evidence but a hunch to support our claim. To explain\naway this prediction, advocates of\n (BNA)\n typically add that while\n (BNA)\n is the only norm that is specific to assertion (and regulates\nassertion directly, cf.\n (A1)\n and\n (A2)),\n it is not the only norm that regulates it. Since assertions\nnecessarily express a belief, and appropriate belief (and/or\npractical action) is allegedly governed by a knowledge-norm,\n (KNA)\n ultimately determines which assertions all-things-considered\nappropriate (Hindriks 2007; Bach 2008; Montminy 2013a).\n\nAll the alternatives to the knowledge norm considered so far require\nless than knowledge for proper assertion. A stronger\nrequirement has been suggested by Stanley (2008):\n\n(EC-A)\nAssert only what is epistemically certain.\n\n\nHere one is epistemically certain of a proposition p\n\n\nif and only if one knows that p (or is in a position to know\nthat p) on the basis of evidence that gives one the highest\ndegree of justification for one\u2019s belief that p. (2008:\n35)\n\n\nAccording to Stanley, since the certainty norm requires more than just\nknowledge, everything that can be explained by appeal to the knowledge\nnorm can also be explained by appeal to the certainty\n norm.[30]\n\nGoldberg (2015) argues that the norm of assertion hypothesis can\nexplain why we have a (pro tanto) epistemic entitlement believe what\nwe are told. He identifies some requirements that are needed to meet\nthis desideratum. One is that the norm of assertion is robustly\nepistemic, and strong enough to warrant testimonial belief (2015: 96).\nAnother is that it must be common knowledge between speaker\nand hearer that the speaker\u2019s assertion is subject to this norm.\nA further requirement (2015: 8) is that the speaker\nauthorizes the hearer to defer back to the speaker the\nresponsibility of meeting challenges to the assertion. Together, these\nassumptions should be able to explain why beliefs based on testimony\nare pro tanto justified.\nExperimental evidence\n\nMost authors who write about the norm of assertion appeal to their own\nintuitions. However, this is an area where experimental data is highly\nrelevant. If the aim is to describe a real-word communicative act,\nrather than a purely idealized philosopher\u2019s construct, it\nfollows a good theory of assertion should make predictions that are\nconsistent with our actual practice: it should deem appropriate the\nassertions that ordinary speakers deem appropriate, and inappropriate\nthe ones that they criticize as inappropriate. If this is right,\ncompeting accounts can be tested empirically against the intuitions of\ncompetent speakers of the language.\n\nEmpirical research on the norm of assertion was initiated by Turri.\nHis (2013) study aims to determine whether people\u2019s\nassertability judgments are better predicted by a factive norm, like\n (KNA)\n or\n (TNA),\n or a non-factive one, like\n (JNA)\n or\n (BNA).\n Turri reports the results of six experiments, primarily investigating\njudgments about unlucky assertions (false assertions that the speaker\nreasonably believes to be true). In the first experiment, Maria\nincorrectly thinks that she has a 1990 Rolex in her watch collection,\nbecause this is what her inventory says. When a friend asks Maria if\nshe has that particular Rolex, participants are asked: \u201cShould\nMaria tell her guest that she has a 1990 Rolex in her\ncollection?\u201d [Yes/No]. Participants overwhelmingly selected the\nnegative option (No), even when different factors were manipulated\n(the control questions, what is at stake, the response options, etc.),\napparently providing robust evidential support for factive accounts.\nTurri has since conducted several more studies, accumulating an\nimpressive body of evidence supporting factive accounts of assertion\nin general and the knowledge-norm in particular (for a review, see\nTurri 2017), including studies on other potential counterexamples to\n (KNA),\n like selfless assertions (2015a), and Gettiered\nassertions (2016).\n\nIt seemed that the debate was settled in favor of the knowledge rule,\nuntil new studies came out that pointed in the opposite direction.\nReuter and Br\u00f6ssel (2019) argue that two factors likely skewed\nthe results in favor of factive accounts in Turri\u2019s (2013)\nseminal study. First, the protagonist (Maria) has a defeater against\nher belief: she is aware that her inventory is occasionally\nmistaken. Second, participants were asked what Maria should\nsay, but it would seem more appropriate to ask whether her assertion\nwas permissible. Manipulating these factors reverted the\nresults: a majority of participants gave responses aligning with\nnon-factive accounts. The authors then conducted new experiments\ninvolving both lucky assertions (true, but not justified) and\nunlucky assertions (false, but justified), finding that\n (JNA)\n was reliably a better predictor of assertability than any of its\nfactive rivals\n (TNA,\n KNA).\n\nKneer (2017) also found solid evidence that\n (JNA)\n is a better predictor of assertability judgments than\n (KNA),\n TNA, and\n (BNA).\n In a first experiment, he tested Gettiered assertions and\nunlucky assertions, measuring assertability with different\nprompts: he asked whether the protagonist \u201cshould say\np\u201d, whether she \u201cis permitted to say\np\u201d, and if saying p is\n\u201cappropriate\u201d. In both the Gettiered condition\nand the unlucky condition, the overwhelming majority of\nparticipants considered p assertable, but not known. Kneer\nconcludes that \u201cknowledge quite clearly doesn\u2019t constitute\nthe norm of assertion\u201d. The other experiments were therefore\ndesigned to verify whether\n (JNA) makes\n more reliable predictions. Experiments 2 and 3 found robust evidence\nthat\n (JNA) is\n a better predictor of assertability judgments than\n (KNA),\n both in Gettier assertions and unlucky assertions,\neven when different factors (like the response options or the kind of\nepistemic support) are manipulated. Experiment 4 shows that\n (JNA) is\n a better predictor of assertability judgments than\n (BNA):\n people judge that \u201chaving a hunch\u201d that p is\ntrue is not good enough ground to assert p. Like Reuter and\nBr\u00f6ssel, Kneer concludes that\n (JNA),\n rather than\n (KNA),\n is better supported by the empirical evidence. In a subsequent study,\nKneer (2021) found that these results are stable across different\ncultures.\n\nThese results are at odds with the initial findings by Turri and\ncolleagues. Given the contrasting data available, how can we determine\nwhich account is best supported by empirical evidence? To answer this\nquestion, Marsili and Wiegmann (2021) note that, in all their\ndifferences, Turri\u2019s studies share a central methodological\naspect: they explore laypeople intuitions by asking a sample of\nsubjects to judge what a particular agent should do in a\ngiven scenario, before the protagonist makes the assertion;\nKneer, Reuter and Br\u00f6ssel adopt instead different prompts and\ntense structures. Marsili and Wiegmann argue that the divergent\nresults are the predictable bi-product of a flaw in the questioning\nmethod employed in the former set of studies. They note that\n\u201cshould\u201d can be interpreted in two ways:\nteleologically (or instrumentally), when it indicates what\nyou should do to achieve your aims, and deontologically, when\nit indicates what you should do to live up to some norms or\nobligations. The authors found experimental evidence that participants\nin Turri\u2019s studies interpreted the test questions\nteleologically, which undermines a factive interpretation of the\nresults. Furthermore, they identify measures that can be introduced to\nprompt the intended (deontological) reading of the test question,\nfinding that when these measures are implemented into Turri\u2019s\nvignettes, participants\u2019 judgments overwhelmingly align with\nnon-factive views like\n (JNA).\n\nIt would therefore seem that the latest studies have tipped the scale\nin favor of non-factive views like\n (JNA).\n However, further research will be needed to settle the disagreement\non empirical grounds.\n5.2 Conventions\n\nAustin held that illocutionary acts as opposed to perlocutionary acts\nare conventional, in the sense that they can be made explicit\nby the so-called performative formula (Austin 1962: 103). According to\nAustin, one can say \u201cI argue that\u201d or \u201cI warn you\nthat\u201d but not \u201cI convince you that\u201d or \u201cI\nalarm you that\u201d. Presumably, the idea was that a speech act type\nis conventional just if there exists a convention by which an\nutterance of a sentence of a certain kind ensures (if uptake is\nsecured) that a speech act of that type is performed. Austin probably\nthought that in virtue of the performative formulas this condition is\nmet by illocutionary but not by perlocutionary act types.\n\nThe more general claim that illocutionary force is correlated by\nconvention with sentence type has been advocated by Dummett (1973\n[1981: 302, 311]). On this view, it is a convention that declarative\nsentences are used for assertion, interrogative for questions and\nimperative for commands and requests. Similar views have been put\nforward by Searle (1969) and Kot\u2019\u00e1tko (1998), and the\nidea has been more recently defended by K\u00f6lbel (2010). According\nto Searle (1969: 38, 40), illocutionary acts are conventional, and the\nconventions in question govern the use of so-called force-indicating\ndevices (Searle 1969: 64) specific to each\n language.[31]\n\nHowever, the view that illocutionary acts types are conventional in\nthis sense has met with much opposition. Strawson (1964:\n153\u2013154) objected early on that ordinary illocutionary acts can\nbe performed without relying on any convention to identify the force,\nfor instance when using a declarative sentence like \u201cThe ice\nover there is very thin\u201d for a warning. This kind of criticism,\ndirected against Dummett, has later been reinforced by Robert J.\nStainton (1996, 2006), stressing that in appropriate contexts,\nsub-sentential phrases like \u201cJohn\u2019s father\u201d\n(pointing at a man) or \u201cvery fast\u201d (looking at a car) can\nbe used to make assertions, and gives linguistic arguments why not all\nsuch uses can be treated as cases of ellipsis (that is, as cases of\nleaving out parts of a well-formed sentence that speaker and hearer\ntacitly aware of). If Strawson and Stainton are right, convention\nisn\u2019t necessary for making assertions.\n\nMoreover, Davidson (1979, 1984) stressed that no conventional sign\ncould work as a force indicator in this sense, since any conventional\nsign could be used (and would be used) in insincere utterances, where\nthe corresponding force was missing, including cases of deception,\njokes, impersonation and other theatrical performances. Basically the\nsame point is made by Bach and Harnish (1979: 122\u2013127). If\nDavidson, and Bach and Harnish are right, then conventions are also\nnot sufficient (but see K\u00f6lbel 2010 for an argument against this\nview).\n\nWilliamson (1996, 239) has argued that that speech acts defined by\nconstitutive rules (like assertion, in his own view) cannot be\nconventional. However, Garc\u00eda-Carpintero (2019) has shown that\nthis position is controversial. The situation is complicated by the\nfact that the general question of when a convention, or rule of any\nkind, is in force for a speaker, is substantial and complex\n(for more on the relation of assertion to convention, Green\n2020a).\n6. Normative Accounts, Hearer-Directed\n6.1 Commitment\n\nMaking an assertion has normative consequences. To characterize the\nsocial dimension of assertion, some authors focus on the distinctive\nresponsibilities\n (\u201ccommitments\u201d[32])\n that a communicator takes on when they claim that something is the\ncase. We shall begin by reviewing two main ways to understand what\nassertoric commitment is.\n\nA first view, that we may call \u201ccommitment as\naccountability\u201d, focuses on the sanctions that speakers\naccept to face if what they claimed turns out to be false. This\ncharacterization of assertion was first developed by Peirce:\n\n\nan act of assertion [\u2026] renders [the speaker] liable to the\npenalties of the social law (or, at any rate, those of the moral law)\nin case [the asserted proposition] should not be true, unless he has a\ndefinite and sufficient excuse. ([CP]: 2.315)\n\n\nWilliam P. Alston (2000: 55) presents the idea as follows: a speaker\naccepts responsibility for a content p being true iff the\nspeaker\n\n\nknowingly [takes] on the liability to ([lay] herself open to) blame\n(censure, reproach, being taken to task, being called to account), in\ncase of\n not-p.[33]\n\n\nThe notion of liability at play here is normative: when you\nassert that p, your audience acquires a (defeasible) right to\ncriticize you if what you say is false. On this view, to assert is\nakin to signing a contract by means of which you take responsibility\nfor something (what you said) being true, and accept to pay the\nconsequences\n otherwise.[34]\n\nTo emphasize this, some authors write that assertions\nguarantee (Peirce [CP]: 5.543; Watson 2004: 66),\nassure (Moran 2005, Hinchman 2013) or warrant\n(Carson 2006) that their content is true. However, it is not obvious\nthat what assertions guarantee is that their content is true.\nIt may be that an assertor instead accepts the responsibility for\nbeing justified in believing that one knows that the\nproposition is true (Green 2009), or that they know that the\nproposition is true.\n\nAn alternative way to characterize the responsibilities generated by\nassertions is to focus on what the speaker is expected to do,\nin virtue of making an assertion. Assertoric responsibility can be\nunderstood as a commitment to act in a certain way. When you\nmake an assertion, you generate an expectation that you will behave in\ncertain ways and not in others, especially in relation to what you\nwill say\n next.[35]\n To take a simple example, once you assert that p, it becomes\ninappropriate for you to make statements that blatantly contradict\np (Hamblin 1970b), or to behave in ways that are sharply at\nodds with accepting p as true (Geurts\n 2019).[36]\n\nFurthermore, making an assertion commits you to respond to\npeople\u2019s questions and challenges in certain ways, as the\nconversation evolves. Brandom (1994: 173\u2013175) emphasizes this,\nand argues that asserting achieves two different social results at the\nsame time: (i) it commits the speaker to defend her claim in response\nto legitimate challenges; and relatedly (ii)\nauthorizes the hearer to claim anything that follows from\nwhat the speaker asserted. MacFarlane (2003: 14\n [Other Internet References])\n summarizes (and revises) the underlying idea as follows:\n\n\nTo assert a sentence S (at a context U) is\n(inter alia) to commit oneself to providing adequate grounds\nfor the truth of S (relative to U), in response to\nany appropriate challenge, or (when appropriate) to defer this\nresponsibility to another asserter on whose testimony one is relying.\nOne can escape this commitment only by withdrawing the assertion.\n\n\nSeveral technical notions are at play here. One is the notion of\nchallenge. To challenge an assertion is to question its\nveracity (or, at least, the speaker\u2019s entitlement to make the\nassertion). An interlocutor can challenge an assertion by means of\nquestions, such as (Q),  or explicit denials, like (D):\n\n(Q)\nHow do you know that?\n(D)\nThat\u2019s not true!\n\n\nChallenges like (Q) and (D) \n are usually appropriate, but not always. For instance, they may be\ninappropriate if in the conversaation it is already settled that what\nthe speaker said is\n true.[37]\n Asserting only commits you to respond to appropriate\nchallenges \u2013 or else retract your assertion (on norms of\nretraction, see\n section 5.1.4.)\n\nIt is often argued that there is a whole family of speech acts\n(\u201cassertives\u201d or \u201crepresentatives\u201d) that\n\u201ccommit the speaker (to varying degrees) to something\u2019s\nbeing the case\u201d (Searle 1979: 12): illocutionary acts such as\nwarning, denying, reminding, arguing, deducing, and so forth.\nThese speech acts differ in the strength of the commitments they\ngenerate (e.g., swearing that p involves a stronger\ncommitment than plain assertion), and in the conditions required for\ntheir felicitous performance (e.g., warning about p is only\nappropriate if p involves a risk or danger for the\ninterlocutor). If a speech act involves a stronger commitment than\nassertion and/or extra felicity conditions, we can say that it is\n\u201cstronger\u201d than assertion. Searle and Vanderveken (1985)\nnote that whenever you perform the stronger speech act, you have also\nmade an assertion. For example, it would not be incorrect to report\n (34)\n or\n (35)\n by saying that the speaker has claimed, asserted,\nor affirmed that she is a certified forklift operator:\n\n(34)\nI swear that I am a certified forklift operator.\n(35)\nI warn you that I am a certified forklift operator.\n\n\nIf this is right, the term \u201cassertion\u201d does not designate\na single illocutionary act, but rather a class of them: it denotes\nevery speech act that is normatively stronger than (or equal to)\nassertion. This seems to lose track of a narrower meaning of the term\n\u201cassertion\u201d, one that sets plain assertions apart from\nstronger assertives. A strategy to rescue this narrow meaning while\nacknowledging assertion\u2019s close ties with other assertives is\nfound in Green (2013, 2017, 2020b: 8). Green, (like Brandom)\nunderstands commitment as a responsibility to defend your claim, and\nargues that an assertion commits you to a greater justificatory burden\nthan weaker assertives, and lesser than stronger assertives (for an\nalternative, like-minded solution, Marsili 2015: 123\u2013127).\nLabinaz (2018) outlines some difficulties for extending the Brandomian\nframework to assertive speech acts, and proposes to adopt an\nalternative approach to degrees of commitment that rather owes to the\nwork of Austin (cf. also Labinaz & Sbis\u00e0 2014:\n\u00a73).\n\nWe have seen that assertions differ from other speech acts in terms of\nthe commitments that they engender. It has also been noted that\nassertions themselves can differ in terms of the commitments that they\ngenerate: not all assertions generate commitment of the same\nstrength.\n\nUsing expressions like \u201cI think that A is\nB\u201d, \u201cProbably/Perhaps A is\nB\u201d, or \u201cA is quite B\u201d, a\nspeaker can mitigate their assertion that A is\nB. And using intensifiers like \u201cI know that A\nis B\u201d, \u201cSurely A is B\u201d,\nor \u201cA is absolutely B\u201d, the speaker can\nstrengthen or boost their assertion that A\nis B. These expressions modulate the degree of the\ncommitment engendered by the assertions in which they occur: they can\nbe used to undertake more or less responsibility\ntowards the content of the assertion, and more generally to modulate\nthe force and of the resulting speech\n act.[38]\n\nThe commitments generated by assertions have often been compared to\nthose generated by promises. For instance, by saying\n (36)\n to a friend, a speaker will typically commit herself to calling the\nrepair shop at 8.\n\n(36)\nI promise to call the repair at 8.\n\n\nIn a standard context, as a result of uttering\n (36),\n both the speaker and the addressee will regard the speaker as having\nincurred an obligation to the addressee.\n\nIn the literature, the standard view is that assertions and promises\ngenerate commitments of different kinds, so that they belong to\ndifferent families (e.g., Searle 1969, 1979). The relation between\nasserting and promising is discussed in detail in Watson (2004), who\nintroduces a distinction between primary and\nsecondary commitments. Assertions and promises differ in the\nprimary commitments that they generate. When you promise to\n\u03c6, your primary commitment is to (intend to)\nact so as to make \u03c6 happen. By contrast,\nwhen you assert that p, your primary commitment is to facts\nthat are independent of your actions: namely, for Watson, the\ndefensibility of p (Watson 2004: 68). Furthermore,\nboth assertions and promises also involve a secondary commitment to\nact in certain ways \u201cif one is queried or if things go\nwrong\u201d (2004: 67). The speaker\u2019s commitment to defend the\nassertion if challenged is on this view a secondary commitment, that\nfollows from the primary one (2004: 70).\n\nSome authors maintain a stronger connection between promising and\nasserting. Marsili (2016) argues that promising that you will\n\u03c6 \u201cillocutionary entails\u201d\nasserting that you will \u03c6. The idea is that\npromises behave like the \u201cstrong assertives\u201d discussed\nabove (swearing, confessing, guaranteeing, etc.), whose performance\ncommits the speaker to having made an assertion. For instance, if Pepa\nutters\n (36),\n it would be appropriate to say that Pepa has asserted,\naffirmed or claimed that she will call the repair shop.\nAnd if Pepa does not believe that she will call the repair shop, it\nwould be appropriate to say that Pepa has lied. In this sense,\npromising that you will do something entails asserting that you will\ndo\n it.[39]\n\nHawley (2019) also draws a strong connection between asserting and\npromises, but in the opposite direction: she analyses assertion in\nterms of promising (cf. also Carson 2006). Hawley suggests that\nwhenever you make an assertion about p, you also promise to\nspeak truthfully as to whether p. This means that whenever\nyou assert, your promise to speak truthfully is simultaneously made\nand either fulfilled or broken (depending on whether you are speaking\ntruthfully or not). However, this view has trouble explaining an\nimportant difference between asserting and promising: assertions can\nbe mitigated (\u201cMaybe I will do it\u201d is perfectly fine) but\npromises cannot (\u201cI promise that maybe I will do it\u201d is\nnot a genuine promise).\n\nCommitment-making is central to some \u201cmixed\u201d accounts of\nassertion\u2014that is, accounts that incorporate insights from\ndifferent theories of assertion. For Peirce, commitment is central to\nassertion, but not alone in characterizing it. In his view, asserting\nalso involves belief-expression: it \u201cconsists in the furnishing\nof evidence by the speaker to the hearer that the speaker believes\nsomething\u201d (Peirce [CP]: 2.335). Furthermore, for Peirce\nassertion is necessarily accompanied by an intention to convince the\nhearer: \u201cevery assertion involves an effort to make the intended\ninterpreter believe what is asserted\u201d (Peirce [CP]: 5.547). In\nshort, Peirce\u2019s view is that in asserting that p, you\nattempt to convince your audience that p is true by providing\nthem with evidence that you believe that p, thereby becoming\ncommitted to (i.e., accountable for) the truth of\n p.[40]\n\nAnother mixed account is defended by Searle (1969) (cf. also Searle\n1975b: 322 and Searle & Vanderveken 1985). Searle\u2019s\ncharacterization of assertion varies slightly throughout his writings,\nbut the central idea is that assertion can be identified on the basis\nof its distinctive rules\u2014the rules for uttering an assertion\n\u201csuccessfully\u201d and \u201cnon-defectively\u201d (i.e.,\nfelicitously). They are presented as rules for the use of\nforce-indicating devices (Searle 1969: 62\u20134). The rules can be\nsummarized as follows. Here S is the speaker and H\nthe hearer:\n\n(Searle)\n\n\n1.\nThe propositional content rule: what is to be expressed is any\nproposition p\n2.\nFirst preparatory rule: S has evidence (reasons etc.) for\nthe truth of p.\n3.\nSecond preparatory rule: It is not obvious to both S and\nH that H knows (does not need to be reminded of,\netc.) p.\n4.\nSincerity rule: S believes p.\n5.\nConstitutive rule: Counts as an undertaking to the effect that\np represents an actual state of affairs.\n \n\n\nThe fifth rule is the crucial one, and is held to be\nconstitutive of assertion. Searle contrasts constitutive\nrules with regulative\n rules.[41]\n Constitutive rules, according to Searle, are like definitions: they\ndefine what it is to engage in a certain activity: for instance,\n\u201cattacking the king in such a way that no move will leave it\nunattacked counts as checkmate\u201d (Searle 1969: 33).\n\nSearle seems to adopt a notion of \u201ccommitment\u201d that\ninvolves both a responsibility to respond to challenges (\u00e0 la\nBrandom) and a liability to sanctions (\u00e0 la Peirce): the\nassertor is expected to \u201cbe able to provide reasons for the\noriginal statement [\u2026] and can be held publicly responsible if\nit turns out to be false\u201d (Searle 2010: 82). Like Peirce, also\nSearle (1969: 65) integrates commitment with belief-expression: the\nspeaker expresses the state required by the sincerity rule, i.e., in\nthe case of assertion, whose sincerity rule is (4), the speaker\nexpresses a belief. Finally, the speaker implies that the preparatory\nconditions are met\u2014so that Searle\u2019s view has the odd\nconsequence that in asserting p, you imply that p is\nnot obviously true.\n\nA third \u201cmixed\u201d account is defended by Green (1999, 2000,\n2007, 2013, 2017, 2020a). Green distinguishes three different\nnormative notions in terms of which assertions (and other assertive\nspeech acts) can be characterized:\n\nFidelity\nLiability\nFrankness\n\n\nThe first component, fidelity, tracks commitment: one\u2019s\nresponsibility to respond to legitimate challenges. More specifically,\nfor Green, being assertorically committed to p means\nbeing responsible to provide \u201cstrong justification if\nchallenged\u201d (2017). Here \u201cstrong\u201d is used in\ncontrast to weaker assertives, like conjectures, for performing which\nis sufficient to be able to provide some (non-conclusive)\njustification if challenged.\n\nThe second component is liability to error:\n\n\none who asserts that P is liable to be right or wrong on the\nissue of P\u2019s truth exactly as P turns out to\nbe true or false. (2020a: 350)\n\n\nThis is a feature that assertion has in common with weaker assertives:\nalso in guessing or hypothesizing that p, you may be right or\nwrong depending on whether p is actually true. This relates\nto Dummett\u2019s idea that \u201can assertion is a kind of gamble\nthat the speaker will not be proved wrong\u201d (1976: 84).\n\nThe third component, frankness, has to do with sincerity:\n\u201cassertion is sincere just in case the speaker believes the\ncontent she has asserted\u201d (Green 2020a: 350). This requirement\nsets assertion aside from other assertives (such as educated guesses\nand conjectures) that do not require belief for sincere performance\n(but rather, e.g., some reasons to think the content true).\n\nA full account of assertion has to provide necessary and\nsufficient conditions for asserting. But is commitment to\nwhat you say sufficient for asserting? That is, if you say that\np and thereby also commit to the truth of p, does it\nfollow that you have asserted that p? Pagin (2004) offers a\nnegative response. The reason is that one can construct an utterance\ntype that isn\u2019t assertoric, but that would be assertoric\naccording to envisaged sufficiency view. A simple example is given\nby\n\n(37)\nI hereby commit myself to the truth of the proposition that there\nare black swans.\n\n\nWhoever utters\n (37)\n felicitously incurs a commitment to the truth of the proposition that\nthere are black swans. However, intuitively\n (37)\n would not be an assertion that there are black swans; at most, it is\na declaration of the speaker\u2019s intent to be committed to that\nproposition. What is said here does not entail that there are black\nswans (it may be accurate even if there are no black swans). If this\nis right, then incurring a commitment is not sufficient for asserting.\nThis objection puts pressure on any \u201chearer-directed\u201d\naccount, including all the ones discussed in section 4, because\nparallel constructions can be derived from any hearer-directed view;\nfor instance (against belief-expression views) by letting the speaker\ndeclare that she is representing herself as believing a given\nproposition.\n\nSome authors have questioned whether this test really undermines\ncommitment accounts of assertion (and social accounts more\ngenerally). Pegan (2009) argues that the counterexamples can be\nblocked by carefully amending the theory; see Pagin (2009) for a\nresponse. MacFarlane (2011) and Garc\u00eda-Carpintero (2013)\nsuggest that if we distinguish between what is said\nand what is asserted, we can\nregard (37) as an assertion that all swans are\nblack. Marsili & Green (2021) argue that this sort of test is\nunreliable, questioning some key assumptions needed for\n(37) to work as a\ncounterexample. They acknowledge, nonetheless, that assertions are not\nfully reducible to their social effects.",
