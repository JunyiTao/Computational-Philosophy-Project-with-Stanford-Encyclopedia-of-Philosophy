    "main_text": "Peer Disagreements || The Justificationist View\n5.3 The Justificationist View\n\n\nOn the spectrum of views of the epistemic significance of\ndisagreement, the Justificationist View lies somewhere in between the\nEqual Weight View and the Steadfast View. In defending the\nJustificationist View, Jennifer Lackey agrees with the Equal Weight\nView\u2019s verdicts in cases like the Restaurant Check Case, but\nthinks that not all cases should be handled in this way. Along these\nlines she gives the following:\n\nElementary Math.  Harry and I, who have been colleagues for\nthe past six years, were drinking coffee at Starbucks and trying to\ndetermine how many people from our department will be attending the\nupcoming APA. I, reasoning aloud, say, \u2018Well, Mark and Mary are\ngoing on Wednesday, and Sam and Stacey are going on Thursday, and\nsince 2+2=4, there will be four other members of our department at\nthat conference.\u2019 In response, Harry asserts, \u2018But 2+2\ndoes not equal 4.\u2019 (Lackey 2010a, 283.)\n\n\nIn Elementary Math, Lackey finds it implausible that she should\nbecome less confident that 2+2=4, never mind to split the difference\nwith her interlocutor and suspend judgment about the matter. In other\nwords, the claim is that the Equal Weight Views gives the wrong\nverdicts in what we might call cases of \u2018extreme\ndisagreement\u2019. What justifies treating Elementary Math\ndifferently than the Restaurant Check Case? According to Lackey, if\nprior to discovering the peer disagreement you are highly justified in\nbelieving the soon to be disputed proposition, then upon discovering\nthe peer disagreement little to no conciliation is called for. So,\nsince Lackey is highly justified in believing that 2+2=4 prior to\ntalking to her colleague, not conciliation is called for, but since\nChristensen was not highly justified in believing that the shares are\n$43 prior to discovering the disagreement, a great deal of conciliation\nis called for. According to the Justificationist View, one\u2019s\nantecedent degree of justification determines the rational response to\npeer disagreement. Strong antecedent justification for believing the\ntarget proposition matters since when coupled with the discovered\ndisagreement you now have reasons to believe your interlocutor is not\nyour peer after all. In Elementary Math, Lackey should significantly\nrevise her views about her colleague\u2019s epistemic position\nregarding elementary math. In contrast, the Restaurant Check Case calls\nfor no similar demotion. This difference is explained by the differing\ndegrees of antecedent justification.\n\n\nApplied to our framework, the Justificationist View denies\nIndependence. In cases where you first-order evidence strongly\nsupports believing p, this fact can be used to reassess your\ninterlocutor\u2019s epistemic credentials. Independence only\npermitted information from \u2018outside\u2019 the disagreement to\naffect assessment of peerhood credentials, but here, the fact that your\ninterlocutor disagrees with something you are highly justified in\nbelieving give you a reason to discount his opinion on the matter.\n\n\nLackey defends the legitimacy of such a demotion due to the\nexistence of personal information. In any case of peer disagreement, I\nwill have information about myself that I simply lack (or lack to the\nsame extent) regarding my interlocutor. I will always be more aware of\nmy alertness, sincerity, open-mindedness, and so forth, than I will be\nof my interlocutor. A similar claim is defended in Benjamin 2015. This\nasymmetry, when coupled with my high antecedent justification for\nbelieving the disputed proposition makes it rational to demote my\nalleged peer. Since in extreme disagreements one party is severely\nmalfunctioning, my personal information makes the best explanation of\nthis fact that it is my peer who is malfunctioning.\n\n\nThe Justificationist View has been criticized in several ways. Some\nobject that high antecedent justification for believing the target\nproposition can make the relevant difference (see Christensen 2007,\nVavova 2014a, 2014b). Consider the following case:\n\nLucky Lotto. You have a ticket in a million-ticket\nlottery. Each ticket is printed with three six-digit numbers that,\nwhen added, yield the seven-digit number that is entered into the\nlottery. Given the odds, I am highly justified in believing that your\nticket is a loser, but I nevertheless add the numbers on your ticket\njust for fun. Having added the numbers and comparing the sum to the\nwinning number \u2013 no match \u2013 I thereby become even more\njustified in believing that you did not win. Meanwhile, you are adding\nup your numbers as well, and comparing them to the winning number. You\nthen exclaim \u2018I won!\u2019 (Christensen 2007,\n200.)\n\n\nIn this case, I have very high antecedent justification for\nbelieving that your ticket is not a winner. Nevertheless, upon hearing\nyou exclaim that you won, the rational response is not to downgrade\nyour epistemic credentials. Even high antecedent justification can be\ndefeated by new information.\n\n\nOthers have agreed that personal information can act as symmetry\nbreaker giving the subject some reason to privilege their own view but\ndeny that such an advantage would be had in suitably idealized cases of\npeer disagreement (Matheson 2015a). The use of personal information to\ndiscount your interlocutor\u2019s opinion would not violate\nIndependence, so the defender of the Equal Weight View\nneedn\u2019t disagree on this score.\n",
