Philosophy and Identity\n\nFrom this brief examination of how identity politics fits into the\npolitical landscape it is already clear that the use of the\ncontroversial term \u201cidentity\u201d raises a host of\nphilosophical questions. Logical uses aside, it is likely familiar to\nphilosophers from the literature in metaphysics on personal\nidentity\u2014one\u2019s sense of self and its persistence. Indeed,\nunderlying many of the more overtly pragmatic debates about the merits\nof identity politics are philosophical questions about the nature of\nsubjectivity and the self (Taylor 1989). Charles Taylor argues that the\nmodern identity is characterized by an emphasis on its inner voice and\ncapacity for authenticity\u2014that is, the ability to\nfind a way of being that is somehow true to oneself (Taylor 1994).\nWhile doctrines of equality press the notion that each human being is\ncapable of deploying their practical reason or moral sense to live\nan authentic life qua individual, the politics of difference has\nappropriated the language of authenticity to describe ways of living\nthat are true to the identities of marginalized social groups. As Sonia\nKruks puts it:\n\nWhat makes identity politics a significant departure from earlier,\npre-identarian forms of the politics of recognition is its demand for\nrecognition on the basis of the very grounds on which recognition has\npreviously been denied: it\nis qua women, qua blacks, qua lesbians\nthat groups demand recognition. The demand is not for inclusion within\nthe fold of \u201cuniversal humankind\u201d on the basis of shared\nhuman attributes; nor is it for respect \u201cin spite of\u201d\none\u2019s differences. Rather, what is demanded is respect for\noneself as different (2001: 85).\n\nFor some proponents of identity politics this demand for\nauthenticity includes appeals to a time before oppression, or a culture\nor way of life damaged by colonialism, imperialism, or even genocide.\nThus for example Taiaiake Alfred, in his defense of a return to\ntraditional Indigenous values, argues that:\n\nIndigenous governance systems embody distinctive political values,\nradically different from those of the mainstream. Western notions of\ndomination (human and natural) are noticeably absent; in their place we\nfind harmony, autonomy, and respect. We have a responsibility to\nrecover, understand, and preserve these values, not only because they\nrepresent a unique contribution to the history of ideas, but because\nrenewal of respect for traditional values is the only lasting solution\nto the political, economic, and social problems that beset our people.\n(Alfred 1999: 5)\n\nWhat is crucial about the \u201cidentity\u201d of identity\npolitics appears to be the experience of the subject, especially their\nexperience within social structures that generate injustice, and the\npossibility of a shared and more authentic or self-determined\nalternative. Thus identity politics rests on the connection between a\ncertain undergoing and the subject-position to which it is attributed,\nand hence on unifying claims about the meaning of politically laden\nexperiences to diverse individuals. Sometimes the meaning given to a\nparticular experience will diverge from that of its subject: thus, for\nexample, the victim of sexual violence who is told they caused their\nown fate by taking risks, when they believe their attacker is culpable.\nMaking sense of such interpretive gaps depends on methods that\nrecognize the divergence between dominant epistemic accounts and\nsubjugated knowledges (Alcoff 2018). Thus concern about this aspect of\nidentity politics has crystallized around the transparency of\nexperience, and the univocality of its interpretation. Experience is\nnever, critics argue, simply epistemically available prior to\ninterpretation (Scott 1992); rather it requires a theoretical\nframework\u2014implicit or explicit\u2014to give it meaning (Heyes\n2020). Moreover, if experience is the origin of politics, then some\ncritics worry that what Kruks (2001) calls \u201can epistemology of\nprovenance\u201d will become the norm: on this view, political\nperspectives gain legitimacy by virtue of their articulation by\nsubjects of particular experiences. This, critics charge, closes off\nthe possibility of critique of these perspectives by those who\ndon\u2019t share the experience, which in turn inhibits political\ndialogue and coalition-building. Nonetheless, skepticism about the\npossibility of experience outside a hermeneutic frame has been\njuxtaposed (or even reconciled) with phenomenological attempts to\narticulate a ground for experience in the lived body (Alcoff 2000; see\nalso Oksala 2004 and 2011; Stoller 2009; Heyes 2020), or in related\naccounts of complex embodiment (Siebers 2017). Recent work in Black\nfeminist philosophy has also returned to identity political language by\nseeking to ground political perspectives in storytelling: for example,\nKristie Dotson (2018) argues that a Black feminism starting from\npersonal narrative provides a practice that can undercut unknowing in\nsettler colonial contexts.\n\nFrom these understandings of subjectivity, it is easy to see how\ncritics of identity politics, and even some cautious supporters, have\nwondered how it can meet the challenges of intersectionality\n(Hill Collins and Bilge 2016). Intersectionality is both an ontology\nand a method, with origins in women of color feminisms, especially\nBlack feminisms (Crenshaw 1989, 1990; Cho, Crenshaw, and McCall 2013;\nHancock 2016). Its central tenet is that no axis of identity can be\nunderstood as separable from others\u2014whether in terms of\nindividual experience or the political structures that underlie social\nstratification. To speak of \u201cpeople of color\u201d without\ndistinguishing between class, gender, sexuality, national and ethnic\ncontexts, for example, is to risk representing the experience of only\nsome of the group\u2019s members\u2014typically those who are most\nprivileged. To the extent that identity politics urges mobilization\naround a single axis, it will put pressure on participants to identify\nthat axis as their defining feature, when in fact they may well\nunderstand themselves as integrated selves who cannot be represented so\nselectively or reductively (Carastathis 2017). Generalizations made\nabout particular social groups in the context of identity politics may\nalso come to have a disciplinary function within the group, not just\ndescribing but also dictating the self-understanding that its members\nshould have. Thus, the supposedly liberatory new identity may inhibit\nautonomy, as Anthony Appiah puts it, replacing \u201cone kind of\ntyranny with another\u201d (1994: 163). Just as dominant groups\nin the culture at large insist that the marginalized integrate by\nassimilating to dominant norms, so within some practices of identity\npolitics dominant sub-groups may, in theory and practice, impose their\nvision of the group\u2019s identity onto all its members.\n\nFor example, a common narrative of U.S. feminist history points to\nuniversalizing claims made on behalf of women during the so-called\n\u201csecond wave\u201d of the feminist movement in the late 1960s\nand 1970s. The most often discussed (and criticized) second wave\nfeminist icons\u2014women such as Betty Friedan or Gloria\nSteinem\u2014are white, middle-class, and heterosexual, although this\nhistorical picture itself too often neglects the contributions of\nlesbian feminists, feminists of color, and working-class feminists,\nwhich were less visible in popular culture, perhaps, but equally\ninfluential in the lives of women. For some early radical feminists,\nwomen\u2019s oppression as women was the core of\nidentity politics and should not be diluted with other identity issues.\nFor example, Shulamith Firestone, in her classic book The\nDialectic of Sex, argued that \u201cracism is sexism\nextended,\u201d and that the Black Power movement represented\nonly sexist cooptation of Black women into a new kind of subservience\nto Black men. Thus for Black women to fight racism (especially among\nwhite women) was to divide the feminist movement, which properly\nfocused on challenging patriarchy, understood as struggle between men\nand women, the foundational dynamic of all oppressions (Firestone 1970:\nesp. 103\u2013120).\n\nSuch claims about the universality of gender have therefore been\nextensively criticized in feminist theory for failing to recognize the\nspecificity of their own constituencies. Friedan\u2019s famous\nproposition that women needed to get out of the household and into the\nprofessional workplace was, bell hooks pointed out, predicated on the\nexperience of a post-war generation of white, middle-class married\nwomen limited to housekeeping and child-rearing by their professional\nhusbands (Friedan 1963; hooks 1981). Many women of color and\nworking-class women had worked outside their homes (sometimes\nin other women\u2019s homes) for decades; some\nlesbians had a history of working in traditionally male occupations or\nliving alternative domestic lives without a man\u2019s \u201cfamily\nwage.\u201d Theorizing the experience of hybridity for those whose\nidentities are especially far from norms of univocality, Gloria\nAnzald\u00faa, for example, writes of\nher mestiza identity as a Chicana, American, raised\npoor, a lesbian and a feminist, living in the metaphoric and literal\nBorderlands of the American Southwest (1999 [1987]). Some women from\nthe less developed world have been critical of Northern feminist theory\nfor globalizing its claims. Such moves construct \u201cThird\nWorld\u201d women, they argue, as less developed or enlightened\nversions of their \u201cFirst World\u201d counterparts, rather than\nunderstanding their distinctively different situation (Mohanty 1991\n[1984]); or, they characterize liberation for Northern women in ways\nthat exacerbate the exploitation of the global poor\u2014by supporting\neconomic conditions in which increasing numbers of western women can\nabuse migrant domestic workers, for example (Anderson 2000). The\nquestion of what a global feminism should make of identity political\nclaims, or how it should conceive solidarity among women from massively\ndifferent locations within the global economic system remains open\n(Weir 2008).\n\nFurther complicating intersectional methods, the very categories of\nidentity that are taken to intersect may themselves be thought of as\nhistorically contingent and variable. To take the example of\n\u201crace,\u201d despite a complex history of biological\nessentialism in the presentation of racial typologies, the notion of a\ngenetic basis to racial difference has been largely discredited; the\ncriteria different societies (at different times) use to organize and\nhierarchize \u201cracial formations\u201d are political and\ncontingent (Omi and Winant 1994 [1986]). While some human physical\ntraits are in a trivial sense genetically determined, the grouping of\ndifferent persons into races does not pick out any patterned\nbiological difference. What it does pick out is a set of social\nmeanings with political ramifications (Alcoff 1997, 2006). The most\nnotorious example of an attempt to rationalize racial difference as\nbiological is the U.S. \u201cone-drop rule,\u201d under which an\nindividual was characterized as Black if they had \u201cone\ndrop\u201d or more of \u201cBlack blood.\u201d Adrian Piper points\nout that not only does this belief persist into contemporary readings\nof racial identity, it also implies that given the prolonged history\nof racial mixing in the US\u2014both coerced and voluntary\u2014very\nsignificant numbers of nominally \u201cwhite\u201d people in the\nU.S.  today should be re-classified as \u201cBlack\u201d (Piper\n1996). In those countries that have had official racial\nclassifications, individuals\u2019 struggles to be re-classified\n(almost always as a member of a more privileged racial group) are\noften invoked to highlight the contingency of race, especially at the\nborders of its categories. And a number of histories of racial groups\nthat have apparently changed their racial identification\u2014Jews,\nItalians, or the Irish, for example\u2014also illustrate genealogical\ntheses (Ignatiev 1995). The claim that race is \u201csocially\nconstructed,\u201d however, does not in itself mark out a specific\nidentity politics. Indeed, the very contingency of race and its lack\nof correlation with categories that have more meaning in everyday life\n(such as ethnicity or culture) may circumscribe its political\nusefulness: just as feminists have found the limits of appeals to\n\u201cwomen\u2019s identity,\u201d so Asian-Americans may find with\nethnicities and cultures as diverse as Chinese, Indian, or Vietnamese\nthat their racial designation itself provides little common ground.\nThat a US citizen of both Norwegian and Ashkenazi Jewish heritage will\ncheck that they are \u201cwhite\u201d on a census form says\nrelatively little (although in a post-Trump U.S., it arguably says\nmore [Jardina 2019]) about their experience of their identity, or\nindeed of their very different relationship to anti-Semitism. Tropes\nof separatism and the search for forms of authentic self-expression\nare related to race via ethno-cultural understandings of identity: for\nexample, the U.S.  Afrocentric movement appeals to the cultural\nsignificance of African heritage for Black Americans (Asante\n2000).\n\nCritical engagement with the origins and conceptualization of\nsubjectivity also informs poststructuralist challenges to identity\npolitics. They charge that it rests on a mistaken view of the subject\nthat assumes a metaphysics of substance\u2014that is,\nthat a cohesive, self-identical subject is ontologically (if not\nactually) prior to any form of social injustice (Butler 1999 [1990]).\nThis subject has certain core essential attributes that define her or\nhis identity, over which are imposed forms of socialization that cause\nher or him to internalize other nonessential attributes. This position,\nthey suggest, misrepresents both the ontology of identity and its\npolitical significance. The alternative view offered by\npoststructuralists is that the subject is itself always already a\nproduct of discourse, which represents both the condition of\npossibility for a certain subject-position and a constraint on what\nforms of self-making individuals may engage in. There is no real\nidentity\u2014individual or group-based\u2014that is separable from\nits conditions of possibility, and any political appeal to identity\nformations must engage with the paradox of acting from the very\nsubject-positions it must also oppose. Central to this position is the\nobservation that any claim to identity must organize itself around a\nconstitutive exclusion:\n\nAn identity is established in relation to a series of differences\nthat have become socially recognized. These differences are essential\nto its being. If they did not coexist as differences, it would not\nexist in its distinctness and solidity. Entrenched in this\nindispensable relation is a second set of tendencies, themselves in\nneed of exploration, to conceal established identities into fixed\nforms, thought and lived as if their structure expressed the true order\nof things. When these pressures prevail, the maintenance of one\nidentity (or field of identities) involves the conversion of some\ndifferences into otherness, into evil, or one of its numerous\nsurrogates. Identity requires differences in order to be, and it\nconverts difference into otherness in order to secure its own\nself-certainty. (Connolly 2002: 64)\n\nThe danger of identity politics, then, is that it casts as authentic\nto the self or group a self-understanding that in fact is defined by\nits opposition to a dominant identity, which typically represents\nitself as neutral. Reclaiming such an identity as one\u2019s own\nmerely reinforces its dependence on this Other, and further\ninternalizes and reinforces an oppressive hierarchy. This danger\nis frequently obscured by claims that particular identities are\nessential or natural, as we saw with race. For example, some early\ngay activists emphasized the immutable and essential\nnatures of their sexual identities. They were a distinctively\ndifferent natural kind of person, with the same rights as (white,\nmiddle-class) heterosexuals (another natural kind) to find fulfillment\nin marriage and family life, property ownership, personal wealth\naccumulation, and consumer culture. This strand of organizing\n(associated more closely with white, middle-class gay men) with its\ncomplex simultaneous appeals to difference and to sameness has a\ngenealogy going back to pre-Stonewall homophilic activism (see\ndiscussion in Terry 1999, esp. 353\u20137). While early lesbian\nfeminists had a very different politics, oriented around liberation\nfrom patriarchy and the creation of separate spaces for\nwoman-identified women, many still appealed to a more authentic,\ndistinctively feminist womanhood. Heterosexual feminine identities were\nproducts of oppression, yet the literature imagines a utopian\nalternative where woman-identification will liberate the lesbian within\nevery woman (e.g., Radicalesbians 1988 [1970]). The paradigm shift that\nthe term \u201cqueer\u201d signals, then, is a shift to a model in\nwhich identities are more self-consciously historicized, seen as\ncontingent products of particular genealogies rather than enduring or\nessential natural kinds (Phelan 1989 and 1994; Blasius 2001). Michel\nFoucault\u2019s History of Sexuality famously argues\nthat \u201chomosexuality appeared as one of the forms of\nsexuality when it was transposed from the practice of sodomy onto a\nkind of interior androgyny, a hermaphrodism of the soul. The sodomite\nhad been a temporary aberration; the homosexual was now a\nspecies\u201d (Foucault 1978: 43). Although Foucault is the most\noften cited as the originator of such genealogical arguments about\nhomosexuality, other often neglected writers contributed to the\nemergence of this new paradigm (e.g., M. McIntosh 1968). Such theories\nstill co-exist uneasily with popularized essentialist accounts of\ngender and sexual identity, which purport to look for a particular\ngene, brain structure, or other biological feature that is\nnoninteractive with environment and that will explain gender-normative\nbehavior (including sometimes trans identity) and same-sex sexual desire.\n\nAt stake are not only epistemological and metaphysical questions about\nhow we can know what kind of thing \u201csexual orientation\u201d\nmight be, but also a host of moral and political questions. Some gay\nactivists thus see biological explanations of sexuality as offering a\ndefense against homophobic commentators who believe that gay men and\nlesbians can voluntarily change their desires.  Indeed, much of the\nintuitive hostility to genealogical or poststructuralist accounts of\nsexuality within gay and lesbian communities even today seems to come\nfrom the dual sense of many individuals that they could not have been\nother than gay, and that anything less than a radically essentialist\nview of sexuality will open the door to further attempts to\n\u201ccure\u201d them of their homosexuality (through\n\u201cconversion therapy,\u201d for example).  Nonetheless, it is\nperfectly possible to argue that the experience of one\u2019s bodily\nfeelings and concomitant sense of self having an origin solely inside\noneself is both deeply felt and in this sense real, and an experience\nwith a history larger than the individual (Heyes 2007; Salamon\n2010). Furthermore, as Eve Sedgwick argues, no specific form of\nexplanation for the origins of sexual preference will be proof against\nthe infinitely varied strategies of homophobia (Sedgwick 1990:\nesp. 22\u201363). That sexual orientation takes on a metaphysical\nlife of its own elides the fact that it is generally sexual\nbehavior\u2014not an abstract \u201cidentity\u201d\u2014that is\nthe object of moral disapprobation. Queer politics, then,\nworks to trouble the categories \u201cgay\u201d and\n\u201clesbian,\u201d as well as \u201cheterosexual\u201d (or\nindeed other categories of social thought in general), and point out\nthat the homo/hetero dichotomy, like many others in western\nintellectual history that it arguably draws on and reinforces, is not\nonly mutually implicated, but also hierarchical (heterosexuality is\nsuperior, normal, and originary, while homosexuality is inferior,\ndeviant, and derivative) and masquerades as natural or\ndescriptive.\n\nThese conflicting positions within gender and sexual politics are\nexemplified in the history of the expansion of gay and lesbian\norganizing to those with other queer affiliations. Those describing\nthemselves as \u201cgay\u201d and \u201clesbian\u201d wondered if\nbisexual and transgender (and then intersex, Two Spirit, asexual, and\nmore) people shared sufficiently similar experience and interests to\nmake an identity political movement. Indeed, this suspicion sometimes\nworked in the opposite direction: not all trans or intersex people have\nunderstood themselves to be queer, or to share the same political goals\nas gay and lesbian organizers, for example. The debate finds a parallel\nin a form of challenge to the inclusion of transwomen in women-only\nspaces (or indeed, their identification as \u201cwomen\u201d in the\nfirst place). The possibility of feminist solidarity across cis and\ntrans lines hinges on the centrality of sex and gender\nidentities\u2014and how those are understood\u2014to political spaces\nand organizing (Heyes 2003). Traditions of trans, mestiza, and cyborg\nfeminist politics have resisted the claim of sameness and recommended\nmodels that embrace the historicity of subject-positions and\nintrasubjective plurality (Stone 1991; Haraway 1991; Lugones 1994; see\nBettcher 2014 for an overview).\n\nWhile the common charge that identity politics promotes a victim\nmentality is often made glibly, Wendy Brown offers a more sophisticated\ncaution against the dangers of ressentiment (the\nmoralizing revenge of the powerless). She argues that identity politics\nhas its own genealogy in liberal capitalism that relentlessly\nreinforces the \u201cwounded attachments\u201d it claims to\nsever: \u201cPoliticized identity thus enunciates itself, makes\nclaims for itself, only by entrenching, restating, dramatizing, and\ninscribing its pain in politics; it can hold out no future\u2014for\nitself or others\u2014that triumphs over this pain\u201d (Brown 1995:\n74). The challenge that identity politics retains attachments to\nhierarchized categories defined in opposition to each other and\nover-identifies with artifactual wounds has been met with more\ndiscussion of the temporality of identity politics: can an\nidentification be premised on a forward-looking solidarity rather than\na ressentiment-laden exclusion (see Zerilli 2005; Weir\n2008; Bhambra and Margee 2010)? It also invites consideration of\nwhether pain is always a regressive, fixed ground of identity claims,\nor whether it might be a legitimate reality for mobilization, as Tobin\nSiebers suggests of disability (2017: 322\u20133). Some proponents of\nidentity politics have suggested that poststructuralism is politically\nimpotent, capable only of deconstruction and never of action (Hartsock\n1998: 205\u2013226). There are, however, political projects motivated\nby poststructuralist theses. For example, Judith Butler\u2019s famous\narticulation of performativity as a way of\nunderstanding subject-development suggests to her and others the\npossibility of disarticulating seamless performances to subvert the\nmeanings with which they are invested (Butler 1999 [1990]). Drag maybe\nconstituted such a disarticulation, although other critics have\nsuggested other examples; Adrian Piper\u2019s conceptual art seeks to\ndisrupt the presumed self-identity of race by showing how it is\nactively interpreted and reconstituted, never determinate and\nself-evident. Linda Zerilli discusses the \u201cworld-building\u201d\nwork of the Milan Women\u2019s Bookstore Collective\u2014a feminist\ngroup that rejects a subject-centred view of women\u2019s injured\nstatus in favor of a protensive practice of freedom (2005: chapter\n3).\n",
