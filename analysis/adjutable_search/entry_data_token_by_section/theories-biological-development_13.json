    "main_text": "Twentieth-Century Genetics: A New Predeterminism || The genetic program\n9.2 The genetic program\n\nIn his influential book What is Life (1944)? Erwin\nSchr\u00f6dinger speculated that development is controlled by \u201ca\ncode-script structure\u201d localized to chromosomes,\ninformation-patterns\n\n\ninstrumental in bringing about the development they\nforeshadow\u2026architect\u2019s plan and builder\u2019s craft all\nin one. (1944: 18\u201319)\n\n\nTwentieth-century triumphs in genetics bolstered this idea. The main\nchallenge for such theories is how invariant genes, the same in every\ncell of an organism, can control the process of diversification of\nthose cells, their temporally-orchestrated movements and organization\ninto tissues, bodily structures, and complex organs. Frank Lillie\n(1927) put the point starkly (discussed in Burian 2005):\n\n\nThe essential problem of development is precisely that differentiation\nin relation to space and time within the life-history of the\nindividual which genetics appears implicitly to ignore\u2026 Those\nwho desire to make genetics the basis of physiology of development\nwill have to explain how an unchanging complex can direct the course\nof an ordered developmental stream. (1927: 365\u2013367)\n\n\nResponses to what Burian has labelled \u201cLillie\u2019s\nparadox\u201d hinge on differences in gene expression among cells and\ntissues. Chromosomal DNA is a linear template for an mRNA transcript,\nwhich is in turn a template for a sequence of amino acids making up a\nprotein. Cell phenotype depends on which genes are transcribed and\nthen translated. But DNA does not express itself. The challenge then\nis to account for gene expression in a way that preserves genetic\ncontrol of development. The concept of a \u201cgenetic program for\ndevelopment\u201d responds to this challenge.\n\nThe idea was forcefully articulated by Fran\u00e7ois Jacob and\nJacques Monod:\n\n\nDuring embryonic development, the instructions contained in the\nchromosomes of the egg are gradually translated and executed\u2026\nThe whole plan of growth, the whole series of operations to be carried\nout, the order and the site of syntheses and their coordination are\nall written down in the nucleic-acid message. (Jacob 1970 [1973:\n313])\n\n\nJacob and Monod\u2019s view was grounded on their pioneering work on\nbacterial gene expression (1961a, 1961b). Their key result, the operon\nmodel, explains how gene expression in E. coli bacteria is\nregulated by environmental signals. Briefly, the model represents\ninteractions among various components: protein-encoding DNA sequences,\nregulatory DNA sequences, the \u201coperator region\u201d of DNA\nlocated near the start of protein-encoding genes, repressor protein,\nand small molecules (e.g., allolactose). If a repressor binds the\noperator region, this blocks protein synthesis at nearby coding\nsequences. Small molecules like allolactose bind the repressor,\ninhibiting its inhibition, so the protein-encoding genes associated\nwith the \u201cde-repressed\u201d operator are expressed. Those\ngenes encode enzymes involved in metabolizing the small molecules,\nneatly closing the regulatory loop. Jacob and Monod singled out DNA as\nthe controlling molecule of this regulatory system. Furthermore, as\nMichael Morange (2000) discusses, they extrapolated the E.\ncoli operon model to gene regulation in general, positing that\nall organismal development is controlled by a small set of regulatory\ngenes.\n\nJacob and Monod\u2019s subsequent work emphasized molecular genetic\nreductionism and the idea of a genetic program for development. For\nexample, Jacob began The Logic of Life (1970 [1973]) with\nreflections on \u201cThe Programme\u201d:\n\n\n\u2026 the structure of macromolecules is determined down to the\nlast detail by sequences of four chemical radicals contained in the\ngenetic heritage. What are transmitted from generation to generation\nare the \u201cinstructions\u201d specifying the molecular\nstructures: the architectural plans of the future organism. They are\nalso the means of executing those plans and of coordinating the\nactivities of the system. In the chromosomes received from its\nparents, each egg therefore contains its entire future: the stages of\nits development, the shape and the properties of the living being\nwhich will emerge. The organism thus becomes the realization of a\nprogramme prescribed by its heredity. (1970 [1973: 1\u20132])\n\n\nHowever, extrapolation from bacterial gene regulation to development\nin multicellular organisms proved unfounded. Limitations of the operon\nmodel soon became evident. In eukaryotic, multicellular organisms,\ngene expression is far more complex. Fifty years of molecular biology\nhave revealed a menagerie of mechanisms implicated in the complex\ncellular machinery of gene expression (see the entry on\n molecular biology).\n And this is not to mention interactions among cells and tissues,\nabout which classic molecular biology was silent. Brian Goodwin, a\nstudent of Waddington\u2019s, charted an alternative theoretical path\nthat skirted these limitations. In the 1960s, he developed equations\nto model genetic oscillation, building on Jacob and Monod\u2019s\noperon model (Goodwin 1965). But his subsequent theorizing about\ndevelopment emphasized self-organization due to chemical gradients and\nmechanical strain in cytoplasm, presaging dynamic and physical\ntheories that gained prominence around the turn of the millennium\n(Goodwin & Trainor 1985, see\n Section 10.2\n and the entry on\n systems and synthetic biology).\n\nThe next experimental milestone for theories of genetic control of\ndevelopment was Christiane N\u00fcsslein-Volhard and\ncollaborators\u2019 painstaking characterization of mechanisms of\nbody patterning and polarity in Drosophila (e.g., Driever &\nN\u00fcsslein-Volhard 1988). They distinguished three regions along\nthe early embryo\u2019s anteroposterior body axis (anterior,\nposterior, and terminal), the basic patterns and structures of which\nare controlled by distinct sets of maternal genes. A few such genes\nhave long-range \u201corganizing\u201d effects. Notably, Driever and\nN\u00fcsslein-Volhard (1988) showed that bicoid protein acts as a\nmorphogen, controlling formation of a fly\u2019s anterior (including\nhead and thorax) in accordance with its concentration gradient.\nSignificantly, their experimental manipulations were DNA sequence\nmutations (known to effect anterior body plan development or bicoid\ncopy number). The experiments thereby charted a causal pathway from\nDNA to mRNA to protein to cell differentiation to morphogenesis. This\ndemonstration of changes in body-plan correlated with maternal genetic\nmutations was powerful vindication of the idea that genes control\ndevelopment. Moreover, central concepts of the organicist alternative\n(gradients and positional information) were brought under the rubric\nof that theory. N\u00fcsslein-Volhard\u2019s gene-based approach\nremains influential in developmental biology (see the entry on\n developmental biology).\n",
