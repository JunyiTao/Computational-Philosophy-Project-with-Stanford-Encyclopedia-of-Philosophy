    "main_text": "Atomism in the Seventeenth Century || Atomism and the Mechanical Philosophy\n2.1 Atomism and the Mechanical Philosophy\n Influential versions of Greek atomism were formulated by a range\nof philosophers in the seventeenth century, notably Pierre Gassendi\n(Clericuzio, 2000, 63\u201374) and Robert Boyle (Stewart, 1979 and\nNewman 2006). Neither the content of nor the mode of argument for\nthese various versions were identical. Here the focus is on the\nversion articulated and defended by Robert Boyle. Not only was Boyle\none of the clearest and ablest defenders of the mechanical philosophy\nbut he was also a leading pioneer of the new experimental science, so\nhis work proves to be particularly illuminating as far as\ndistinguishing philosophical and empirical aspects of atomism are\nconcerned.\n\n\nThe mechanical philosophy differed from the atomism of the Greeks\ninsofar as it was intended to apply to the material world only and not\nto the spiritual world. Apart from that major difference, the\nworld-views are alike. Fundamentally there is just one kind of matter\ncharacterised by a property that serves to capture the tangibility of\nmatter and distinguish it from void. Boyle chose absolute\nimpenetrability as that property. There are insensibly small portions\nof matter that, whilst they are divisible in thought or by God, are\nindivisible as far as natural processes are concerned. Boyle,\nmisleadingly drawing on another tradition that will be discussed in a\nlater section, referred to these particles as minima\nnaturalia or prima naturalia. Here they are referred to\nas atoms, a terminology only very rarely adopted by Boyle\nhimself. Each atom has an unchanging shape and size and a changeable\ndegree of motion or rest.  All properties of the material world are\nreducible to and arise as a consequence of the arrangements and\nmotions of the underlying atoms. In particular, properties possessed\nby macroscopic objects, both those detectable directly by the senses,\nsuch as colour and taste, and those involved in the interaction of\nbodies with each other, such as elasticity and degree of heat, are to\nbe explained in terms of the properties of atoms. Those properties of\natoms, their shape, size and motion, together with the impenetrability\npossessed by them all, are the primary ones in terms of which the\nproperties of the complex bodies that they compose, the secondary\nones, are to be explained. Such explanations involve the fundamental\nlaws of nature that govern the motions of atoms.\n\n\nNot all of the mechanical philosophers were mechanical atomists.\nDescartes provides a ready example of a mechanical philosopher who was\nnot an atomist insofar as he rejected the void and held that particles\nof matter could be broken down into smaller particles. The mechanical\nphilosophers were divided on the question of the existence of the\nvoid, some sharing the opinion of the Greek atomists that void was a\npre-requisite for motion but others, like Descartes, rejecting the\nvoid as unintelligible and hence regarding all motion as involving the\nsimultaneous displacement of closed loops of matter whether that\nmatter be continuous or particulate. Arguments at the most general\nlevel for the intelligibility of the void and its relation to the\npossibility of motion were inconclusive. In addition to the question\nof the void, there is the question of whether matter is particulate\nand whether there are indivisible particles called atoms. Once again,\ngeneral a priori philosophical arguments were hardly able to settle\nthe question.\n\n\nBoyle, along with his fellow mechanical philosophers, argued for his\nposition on the grounds that it was clear and intelligible compared to\nrival systems such as Aristotelianism and those developed in chemical\nand related contexts by the likes of Paracelsus. The argument operated\nat the level of the fundamental ontology of the rival philosophies.\nBoyle insisted that it is perfectly clear what is intended when shape,\nsize and degree of motion are ascribed to an impenetrable atom and\nwhen arrangements are ascribed to groups of such atoms. That much can\nsurely be granted. But Boyle went further to insist that it is\nunintelligible to ascribe to atoms properties other than these primary\nones, that is, properties other than those that atoms must necessarily\npossess by virtue of being portions of matter, such as the forms and\nqualities of the Aristotelians or the principles of the\nchemists. \u2018Nor could I ever find it intelligibly made\nout\u2019, wrote Boyle, \u2018what these real qualities may be, that\nthey [the scholastics] deny to be either matter, or modes of matter,\nor immaterial substances\u2019 (Stewart, 1979, 22). If an atom is\nsaid to possess elasticity, for example, then Boyle is saying that the\nontological status of whatever it is that is added to matter to render\nit elastic is mysterious, given that it cannot be material. This is\nnot to claim that attributing elasticity and other secondary\nproperties to gross matter is unintelligible. For such properties can\nbe rendered intelligible by regarding them as arising from the primary\nproperties and arrangements of underlying atoms. Secondary properties\ncan be ascribed to the world derivatively but not primitively. So the\nstark ontology of the mechanical philosopher is established a priori\nby appealing to a notion of intelligibility.\n",
