    "main_text": "Defining Perceptual Learning || Perceptual Learning as Long-Term Perceptual Changes\n1.1 Perceptual Learning as Long-Term Perceptual Changes\n\nPerceptual learning involves long-term changes in perception.\nThis criterion rules out short term perceptual changes due to sensory\nadaptation (for more on sensory adaptation see Webster 2012). In the\nwaterfall illusion, for instance, a person who looks at a waterfall\nfor a minute, and then looks away at some rocks, sees the rocks as\nmoving even though they are not. This is a short-term change in\nperception, lasting perhaps for fifteen to thirty seconds. Since it is\nnot a long-term change in perception, however, it does not count as\nperceptual learning. In another short term adaptive change, a person\nwho goes indoors after walking through a blizzard may have trouble as\nher eyes adjust to the new lighting. There is a change in her\nperception as a result of her experience in the blizzard. But it is\nnot a long-term change, and so it does not count as perceptual\nlearning.\n\nWhile there are clear cases of long-term experience-induced perceptual\nchanges and clear cases of short-term experience-induced perceptual\nchanges, there may be intermediary cases where it is difficult to tell\nwhether they count as long-term or not. In such cases, in order to\ndetermine whether the case is a genuine case of perceptual learning,\nit may be necessary to look at the mechanisms involved (see\n section 2\n below on the mechanisms of perceptual learning). If the mechanisms\ninvolved are characteristic of other cases of perceptual learning,\nthen that is a reason to count the case as an instance of perceptual\nlearning. If the mechanisms involved are uncharacteristic of\nperceptual learning, then that is a reason not to count the case as an\ninstance of perceptual learning.\n",
