    "main_text": "Building Blocks of Modern Theories of Information || Languages\n3.1 Languages\n\nOne of the most elaborate proposals for a universal\n\u201cphilosophical\u201d language was made by bishop John Wilkins\n(Maat 2004): \u201cAn Essay towards a Real Character, and a\nPhilosophical Language\u201d (1668). Wilkins\u2019 project consisted\nof an elaborate system of symbols that supposedly were associated with\nunambiguous concepts in reality. Proposals such as these made\nphilosophers sensitive to the deep connections between language and\nthought. The empiricist methodology made it possible to conceive the\ndevelopment of language as a system of conventional signs in terms of\nassociations between ideas in the human mind. The issue that currently\nis known as the symbol grounding problem (how do arbitrary\nsigns acquire their inter-subjective meaning) was one of the most\nheavily debated questions in the eighteenth century in the context of\nthe problem of the origin of languages. Diverse thinkers as Vico,\nCondillac, Rousseau, Diderot, Herder and Haman made contributions. The\ncentral question was whether language was given a priori (by\nGod) or whether it was constructed and hence an invention of man\nhimself. Typical was the contest issued by the Royal Prussian Academy\nof Sciences in 1769:\n\n\nEn supposant les hommes abandonn\u00e9s \u00e0 leurs\nfacult\u00e9s naturelles, sont-ils en \u00e9tat d\u2019inventer\nle langage? Et par quels moyens parviendront-ils\nd\u2019eux-m\u00eames \u00e0 cette invention? \n\nAssuming men abandoned to their natural faculties, are they able to\ninvent language and by what means will they come to this\n invention?[1]\n\n\nThe controversy raged on for over a century without any conclusion and\nin 1866 the Linguistic Society of Paris (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de\nLinguistique de Paris) banished the issue from its arena.\n [2]\n\nPhilosophically more relevant is the work of Leibniz (1646\u20131716)\non a so-called characteristica universalis: the notion of a\nuniversal logical calculus that would be the perfect vehicle for\nscientific reasoning. A central presupposition in Leibniz\u2019\nphilosophy is that such a perfect language of science is in principle\npossible because of the perfect nature of the world as God\u2019s\ncreation (ratio essendi = ration cognoscendi, the\norigin of being is the origin of knowing). This principle was rejected\nby Wolff (1679\u20131754) who suggested more heuristically oriented\ncharacteristica combinatoria (van Peursen 1987). These ideas\nhad to wait for thinkers like Boole (1854, An Investigation of the\nLaws of Thought), Frege (1879, Begriffsschrift), Peirce\n(who in 1886 already suggested that electrical circuits could be used\nto process logical operations) and Whitehead and Russell\n(1910\u20131913, Principia Mathematica) to find a more\nfruitful treatment.\n",
