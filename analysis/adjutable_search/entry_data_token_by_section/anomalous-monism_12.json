    "main_text": "Premise III: The Anomalism Principle || The Causal Definition Argument\n4.3 The Causal Definition Argument\n\nWe have been looking at different ways of making sense of and\njustifying Davidson\u2019s claim that mental anomalism stems from the\nconstitutive role of rationality in mental ascription. In\nDavidson\u2019s writings, however, another line of argument often\nsurfaces which focuses less on the rational nature of mental events\nand more on their causal nature. As we have already seen, in his\nearliest work on action Davidson argued that reasons explain actions\nby causing them, and he later came to emphasize that what makes mental\nstates and events what they are is determined in part by their causes\nand effects. Particular psychological explanations are causal (they\ninvoke causes\u2014Davidson 1963), and are formulated in terms of\ncausally defined concepts (for propositional attitudes, see Davidson\n1987b, 41; for mental contents, see Davidson 1987a, 44). In later work\nhe frequently notes the anomic nature of causal concepts and causal\nexplanations, and how mental properties and reasons explanations are\nanomic because of this\u2014\u201creason-explanations\u2026are in\nsome sense low-grade; they explain less than the best explanations in\nthe hard sciences because of their heavy dependence on causal\npropensities\u201d (Davidson 1987b, 42; see also Davidson 1991, 162).\nIf mental concepts are causally defined, and strict laws do not employ\ncausally defined concepts, then mental anomalism appears to follow\nstraight away, without need of any detour through issues concerning\nthe rationality of mental concepts.\n\nExtending this reasoning, Davidson writes that\n\n\n[m]ental concepts\u2026appeal to causality because they are\ndesigned, like the concept of causality itself, to single out from the\ntotality of circumstances which conspire to cause a given event just\nthose factors that satisfy some particular explanatory interest.\n(Davidson 1991, 163)\n\n\nThis appears to ground the causal definition of anomic properties\n(whether mental or otherwise) in the fact that they answer to\nparticular explanatory interests. This is contrasted with the case of\n\u2018ultimate physical\u2019 properties: \u201cExplanation in\nterms of the ultimate physics, though it answers to various interests,\nis not interest relative\u201d (Davidson 1987b, 45). This seems to\ncollapse the distinction between psychology and all the other special\nsciences with respect to the question of anomalism. All of the latter\nanswer to particular explanatory interests, and are thus\nselective with respect to the total sufficient condition for\nan effect-type (see Davidson 1987b, 45); the causal definition, and\nthus anomalism, of their vocabularies is owed to this\ninterest-relativity and selectivity. \u2018Ultimate physics\u2019,\non the other hand, \u201ctreats everything without exception as a\ncause of an event if it lies within physical reach (falls within the\nlight cone leading to the effect)\u201d (Davidson 1987b, 45).\n\nDavidson repeats these sorts of claims about the anomic nature of\ncausally defined properties in a number of places in later writings,\nbut at no point does he clearly bring them into contact with his early\nremarks concerning the constitutive role of rationality in\npsychological ascription. And he never provides argument in support of\nthis general thesis concerning causality. It is natural to wonder why,\ngiven this general thesis about causally defined concepts, rationality\nshould be thought to underwrite mental anomalism. And it becomes\nimperative to know why that general thesis is plausible (for\ndiscussion, see Yalowitz 1998a).\n\nWith regard to the first issue, there is some evidence that Davidson\nis confusing two distinct questions: why mental concepts cannot stand\nin lawlike relation to physical concepts, and why mental concepts\ncannot be eliminated in favor of physical concepts in the explanation\nof human behavior. Given the general thesis about causally defined\nproperties, we have an understanding of why mental concepts are\nanomic. But this leaves open the question whether we ought to continue\nto traffic in anomic concepts generally, and mental concepts in\nparticular. Why not eliminate them in favor of the nomic physical\nconcepts? Here, the rationality of mental concepts may be thought to\nprovide an answer. If we wish to understand why an agent performed the\naction that she did, as opposed to having a full sufficient causal\nexplanation of why her body moved as it did, we are interested in a\nselective explanation\u2014that part of the total sufficient\ncondition that satisfies the particular explanatory interests behind\nreasons-explanations (Davidson 1991, 163). Those interests highlight\nthe normative nature of reason and action\u2014their responsiveness\nto the principle of charity and ideal of rationality. Rationality, on\nthis line of thinking, does not account for mental anomalism; but it\ndoes speak to the question of mental realism (see further\n 6.2).\n (For further discussion of the anomic nature of causally defined\nconcepts and its bearing on Anomalous Monism, see Yalowitz 1998a. For\nmore on the relation between rational explanation and mental realism,\nsee the supplement on\n Explanatory Epiphenomenalism.\n For discussion of issues closely related to the causal definition\nargument, see\n 6.3\n and the supplement on\n Related Issues\n (Mental Anomalism and Semantic Externalism).\n",
