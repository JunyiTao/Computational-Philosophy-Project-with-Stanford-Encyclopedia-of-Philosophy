    "main_text": "Conceptual Matters\n1. Conceptual Matters\n\nSeveral terms are used to denote extra-constitutional rejection of an\nexisting government\u2019s authority, either tout court or\nin some particular domain: resistance, rebellion, secession,\nrevolution. Resistance need not be total; it can instead involve\ndisobeying some particular law or laws or efforts to thwart only some\nof a government\u2019s policies or the government\u2019s attempt to\nperform particular actions; and resistance can take a number of forms,\nincluding acts of disobedience that are not only public but designed\nto achieve maximal publicity (as in the case of civil disobedience),\nas well as covert acts of noncompliance; and it may also be either\npeaceful or nonviolent and disruptive or not. Rebellion, usefully\ndistinguished from resistance, involves a wholesale rejection of\ngovernment\u2019s authority. But the government\u2019s authority\ncould be rejected for quite different reasons: to do away with\ngovernment altogether (the anarchist\u2019s goal), to establish a new\ngovernment with the same domain of territorial authority, to create a\nnew territorial unit out of part of the territory ruled by the\nexisting government (secession), or to sever part of the territory of\nthe government and join it to another existing state (irredentist\nsecession).\n\nRevolution is commonly understood to have two components: rejection of\nthe existing government\u2019s authority and an attempt to replace it\nwith another government, where both involve the use of forceful\nextra-constitutional means. On this reading, revolution and rebellion\nshare a negative aim, the wholesale rejection of a government\u2019s\nauthority, but revolution includes in addition a positive aim, to\ninstitute a new government in place of the one it has destroyed. Note\nthat on our use of the term, \u201cconstitution\u201d is meant to\nrefer to something broader than foundational legal principles or a\nfoundational legal document. Rather, we understand a constitution to\nexist when there is coordination among a sufficient number of members\nof some group on some basic rules for collective decision-making. On\nour understanding, then, a bargain struck among military elites\ndefining roles in a society run by a military junta counts as a\nconstitution, and a popular militant uprising that aimed at displacing\nsuch a regime would thus count as a revolution.\n\nSome important empirical work relevant to the morality of\nrevolutionary war is to be found in studies of civil war. The latter\nis sometimes defined as a large-scale armed conflict between state\nforces and one or more nonstate parties. This definition may be too\nrestrictive, however, since it would exclude a large-scale armed\nconflict between two or more nonstate parties under conditions in\nwhich the government had disintegrated entirely or still existed but\nwas not capable of fielding forces. A broader understanding of civil\nwar that would encompass that kind of case would be simply that of a\nlarge-scale intrastate armed conflict.\n\nThe preceding terms are not always used in this way in actual\npolitical discourse. For example, the government of the United States\nlabeled the secession of the Southern states from the Union a\nrebellion, while many Confederates called their enterprise the Second\nAmerican Revolution; and the American colonists who strove to secede\nfrom the British Empire tended to call themselves revolutionaries, not\nsecessionists or rebels. (It may be that the Americans avoided the\nterm \u201crebel\u201d because they thought it had negative\nconnotations). Similarly, the Algerian secession from France is often\nreferred to as the Algerian Revolution and wars of colonial liberation\nare rarely called secessionist conflicts, though their goal is\nsecession from a political order centered on a metropolitan state\nwhose territory is not adjacent to the colony. In what follows, the\nterm \u201crevolution\u201d will be reserved for\nextra-constitutional attempts to destroy an existing national\ngovernment and replace it, to the full extent of its territorial\nauthority, with a new government. On this way of sorting out the\nvarious terms, secessionists and revolutionaries are necessarily\nrebels, while rebels need be neither secessionists nor revolutionaries\n(they may be anarchists), and secessionists as such are not\nrevolutionaries.\n\nSometimes the term \u201crevolution\u201d is used in a stronger\nsense, as denoting not just an extra-constitutional attempt to replace\none government with another, but also to effect a fundamental change\nin the type of government, as in a revolution to replace an autocracy\nwith a democracy. Thus some scholars on the Left have contended that\nthe so-called American Revolution was not really a revolution, because\nit did not create or even aim at anything other than a new form of the\nbourgeois state\u2014a state controlled by and in the interest of the\nclass that controls the means of production (Zinn 1980, Jennings\n2000). Many American historians have concluded otherwise, asserting\nthat it was a revolution in the stronger sense because it replaced a\nmonarchy with a republic (Nash 2005; Wood 1993). On this stronger\nunderstanding of revolution as involving a fundamental change in the\ntype of government, secessionists would also be revolutionaries, if\nthe new government they attempt to establish in part of the territory\nof the state would be of a fundamentally different type. For the\nremainder of the discussion, we will use \u201crevolution\u201d in\nthe weaker sense, with the understanding that it can also encompass\nrevolutions in the stronger sense. It is worth noting, however, that\nthe morality of revolution in the stronger sense is, if anything, more\ncomplex than that of the weaker sense, because the former involves not\nonly the extra-constitutional overthrow of the existing government but\nalso the extra-constitutional establishment of a new type of\ngovernment.\n\nOne more distinction is needed. Revolutions may be violent or\nnonviolent and may begin nonviolently and become violent. This\ndistinction, though obviously important, is not so crisp as one might\nthink, because what counts as violence may be disputed. For example,\nattempts to overthrow a government by disruptive techniques (for\nexample conducting general strikes, disabling power grids, or blocking\nmain transportation routes) are not violent in the way in which\ndischarging firearms or detonating explosives is, but they may\nnonetheless cause lethal harms. The chief topic of this entry is\nviolent revolution where \u201cviolence\u201d is understood in the\nmost robust way and as occurring on a large scale; in other words, the\ntopic is revolutionary war as \u201cwar\u201d is usually understood\n(Singer & Small 1994: 5).\n\nIt is well worth noting, however, that there is a position on\nrevolution that obviates the need for a theory of just revolutionary\nwar, namely, the view that large-scale revolutionary violence is never\nmorally justified because the risks of such an endeavor are so great\nand because nonviolent revolution is more efficacious. Some empirical\npolitical scientists have argued that there is good evidence that\nnonviolent revolution is more likely to achieve its ends than\nrevolutionary war (Chenoweth & Stephan 2011). Even if that is true\nas a generalization, the question remains as to whether there are\nexceptions\u2014cases where nonviolence is not likely to achieve the\naims of just revolution or would only achieve them with undue costs in\nterms of human well-being\u2014and whether they can be identified\nex ante. If there are any such cases, there is a need for a\ntheory of just revolutionary war.\n",
