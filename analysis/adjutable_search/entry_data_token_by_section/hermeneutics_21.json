Further Developments\n\nResearch in hermeneutics is perhaps more diverse now than at any other\nperiod in the historical movement, and has also begun to expand\ninterest in hermeneutical considerations to contexts such as feminist\nphilosophy (see Warnke 2015), comparative philosophy (see, for\nexample, Nelson 2017), philosophy of embodiment (see, for example,\nKearney 2015), and Latin American philosophy (see, for example, Vallega\n2019). While it is impossible to gather all directions of current\nresearch in a short article, some further developments have received\nparticular attention.\n",
