    "main_text": "Issues raised by convention || Social convention\n1.1 Social convention\n\n\nThis concept is the target of David Lewis\u2019s celebrated analysis in\nConvention (1969). A social convention is a regularity widely\nobserved by some group of agents. But not every regularity is a\nconvention. We all eat, sleep, and breathe, yet these are not\nconventions. In contrast, the fact that everyone in the United States\ndrives on the right side of the road rather than the left is a\nconvention. We also abide by conventions of etiquette, dress, eating,\nand so on.\n\n\nTwo putative social conventions commonly cited by philosophers are\nmoney and language. Aristotle mentions the former\nexample in the Nicomachean Ethics (V.5.II33a):\n\n\nMoney has become by convention a sort of representative of demand; and\nthis is why it has the name \u201cmoney\u201d\n(\u201cnomisma\u201d)\u2014because it exists not by nature\nbut by law (nomos) and it is in our power to change it and\nmake it useless,\n\n\nand the latter example in De Interpretatione (16a.20\u201328):\n\n\nA name is a spoken sound significant by convention\u2026 I say\n\u201cby convention\u201d because no name is a name naturally but\nonly when it has become a symbol.\n\n\nDavid Hume mentions both examples in the Treatise of Human\nNature (p. 490):\n\n\n[L]anguages [are] gradually establish\u2019d by human conventions\nwithout any explicit promise. In like manner do gold and silver become\nthe common measures of exchange, and are esteem\u2019d sufficient\npayment for what is of a hundred times their value.\n\n\nAlthough Hume analyzed money at some length in the 1752 \u201cOf\nMoney,\u201d it now receives systematic attention mainly from\neconomists rather than\n philosophers.[1]\n In contrast, philosophers still lavish great attention upon the\nextent, if any, to which language rests upon convention. David Lewis\noffers a theory of linguistic conventions, while Noam Chomsky and\nDonald Davidson argue that convention sheds no light upon\nlanguage. See section 7,\n Conventions of language.\n\n\nFor many philosophers, a central philosophical task is to elucidate how\nwe succeed in \u201ccreating facts\u201d through our conventions. For\ninstance, how does convention succeed in conferring value upon money or\nmeaning upon linguistic items? Ideally, a satisfying answer to these\nquestions would include both an analysis of what social conventions\nare and a description of the particular conventions underlying\nsome range of \u201cconventional\u201d facts. Hume\u2019s theory of\nproperty and Lewis\u2019s theory of linguistic meaning serve as\nparadigms here.\n\n\nWhat are social conventions? A natural first thought is that they are\nexplicit agreements, such as promises or contracts, enacted\neither by parties to the convention or by people suitably related to\nthose parties (such as their ancestors). This conception underwrites at\nleast one famous conventionalist account: Thomas Hobbes\u2019s theory\nof government as resulting from a social contract, into which\nagents enter so as to leave the state of nature. However, it\nseems clear that the vast majority of interesting social phenomena,\nincluding government, involve no explicit historical act of agreement.\nSocial conventions can arise and persist without overt convening.\n\n\nPartly in response to such worries, John Locke emphasized the notion\nof a tacit agreement. A tacit agreement obtains if there has\nbeen no explicit agreement but matters are otherwise as if an\nexplicit agreement occurred. A principal challenge here is explaining\nthe precise respects in which matters are just as if an explicit\nagreement occurred. Moreover, many philosophers argue that appeal even\nto \u201cas if\u201d agreements cannot explain linguistic meaning.\nWhat language would participants in such an agreement employ when\nconducting their deliberations? Bertrand Russell observes that\n\u201c[w]e can hardly suppose a parliament of hitherto speechless\nelders meeting together and agreeing to call a cow a cow and a wolf a\nwolf\u201d (1921, p. 190). As W. V. Quine asks, then, \u201cWhat is\nconvention when there can be no thought of convening?\u201d (1969, p.\nxi). Some philosophers take this argument to show that language does\nnot rest upon convention. Others, such as Lewis, take it as impetus to\ndevelop a theory of convention that invokes neither explicit nor tacit\nagreement.\n",
