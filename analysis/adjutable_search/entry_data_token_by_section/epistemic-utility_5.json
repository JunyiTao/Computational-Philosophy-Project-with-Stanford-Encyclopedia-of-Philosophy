    "main_text": "Epistemic Utility Arguments concerning Outright Beliefs || Expected Epistemic Utility and the Lockean Thesis\n4.2 Expected Epistemic Utility and the Lockean Thesis\n\nDominance is a very weak norm of rational choice, but there are\nstronger ones. Among them is one of the most popular norms of decision\ntheory, which says you should maximize expected utility from the point\nof view of your credences.\n\n\nMaximize Subjective Expected Utility If one option\nhas greater expected utility than another from the point of view of\nyour credences, then rationality requires that you should not choose\nthe second.\n\n\nThe expected utility of an option relative to your credences is\nobtained by taking its utility at each state, weighting that by your\ncredence in that state, and summing up these credence-weighted\nutilities. For instance, suppose \\(p\\) is your credence in a\nproposition and \\(1-p\\) is your credence in its negation. Then the\nexpected epistemic utility of believing that proposition from the\npoint of view of your credences is\n\n\\(p \\times \\text{epistemic utility of believing a truth} + (1-p)\\\n\\times\\)\n\n\\( \\text{epistemic utility of believing a falsehood} = pR +\n(1-p)(-W)\\)\n\n\nNow we can ask when believing a proposition maximizes expected utility\nfrom the point of view of your credences.\n\n\nExpectation Theorem for the Lockean Thesis (Hempel 1962;\nEaswaran 2016; Dorst 2017) Suppose your credence in \\(X\\) is\n\\(p\\). Then:\n\nIf \\(p \\gt \\frac{W}{R+W}\\), then believing \\(X\\) uniquely\nmaximizes expected epistemic utility. (That is, believing has strictly\ngreater expected utility than suspending.)\nIf \\(p = \\frac{W}{R+W}\\), then believing \\(X\\) and suspending\njudgment on \\(X\\) both maximize expected epistemic utility. (That is,\nbelieving has the same expected utility as suspending.)\nIf \\(p \\lt \\frac{W}{R + W}\\), then suspending judgment on \\(X\\)\nuniquely maximizes expected epistemic utility. (That is, believing has\nstrictly less expected utility than suspending.)\n\n\n\nEaswaran and Dorst both appeal to this result to argue for the Lockean\nThesis, which is the most well-known norm that connects credences and\noutright beliefs. It takes its name from passages in John\nLocke\u2019s (1689 [1975]) An Essay on Human Understanding\nin which he suggests that belief is nothing more than sufficiently\nhigh credence, but it was formulated explicitly by Richard Foley\n(1992). In fact, the Lockean Thesis is a family of putative norms:\neach member of the family is distinguished by the threshold above\nwhich it demands belief, below which it demands suspension, and at\nwhich it permits either.\n\n\nThe Lockean Thesis with threshold \\(t\\) Suppose\nyour credence in \\(X\\) is \\(p\\). Then\n\n\nIf \\(p \\gt t\\), you are rationally required to believe \\(X\\);\nIf \\(p = t\\), you are rationally permitted to believe \\(X\\) and\nrationally permitted to suspend on \\(X\\);\nIf \\(p \\lt t\\), you are rationally required to suspend on\n\\(X\\).\n\n\n\nThen we have the following argument:\n\n\nJamesian Epistemic Utility\n \\(0 \\lt R, W\\).\n\nMaximize Subjective Expected Utility\n\nTherefore,\n\nThe Lockean Thesis with threshold \\(\\frac{W}{R+W}\\)\n\n4.2.1 Expected Epistemic Utility, the Uniqueness Thesis, and Epistemic Permissivism\n\nThomas Kelly (2014) has pointed out that this argument has an\ninteresting consequence for the debate in epistemology between those\nwho argue for the Uniqueness Thesis and those who side with Epistemic\nPermissivism. Given a sort of epistemic state, the Uniqueness Thesis\nfor that sort of state runs as follows:\n\n\nThe Uniqueness Thesis Given an agenda, the following\nholds: for any body of evidence, there is a unique epistemic state of\nthe given sort concerning the propositions in that agenda that\nrationality requires you to have if that body of evidence is your\ntotal evidence.\n\n\nEpistemic Permissivism is simply the negation of the Uniqueness\nThesis. So, for instance, the Uniqueness Thesis for credences says\nthat, for any agenda and any body of evidence, there is a unique\ncredence function over that agenda that rationality requires you to\nhave in response to that evidence, while Epistemic Permissivism says\nthat there is at least one body of evidence for which there is more\nthan one credence function it is rational to have in response to that\nevidence.\n\nNow, suppose you subscribe to the Uniqueness Thesis about credences.\nBut you also think that rationality permits different ways in which\nyou might set the utility \\(R\\) of believing a truth and the utility\n\\(-W\\) of believing a falsehood. For instance, you might think \\(R =\n1, W = 2\\) is permitted, but so is \\(R = 2, W = 3\\). And suppose the\nunique rational credence in proposition \\(X\\) is 0.65. Maximizing\nexpected epistemic utility with \\(R = 2, W = 3\\) entails the Lockean\nThesis with threshold \\(\\frac{3}{2+3}\\), and this requires that you\nbelieve \\(X\\), since \\(0.65 \\gt \\frac{3}{2+3}\\); but maximizing\nexpected epistemic utility with \\(R = 1, W = 2\\) entails the Lockean\nThesis with threshold \\(\\frac{2}{1+2}\\), and this requires that you\nsuspend on \\(X\\), since \\(0.65 \\lt \\frac{2}{1+2}\\). And so we have\nEpistemic Permissivism about outright beliefs, even though we have the\nUniqueness Thesis for credences. Which beliefs rationality requires\nyou to have depends not only on your evidence, but also on your\nepistemic utilities. In general, the smaller the ratio of \\(R\\) to\n\\(W\\), the higher your credence in a proposition must be for you to\nbelieve it.\n4.2.2 Expected Epistemic Utility and Consistency\n\nAnother interesting consequence of the\n Expectation Theorem for the Lockean Thesis\n is that it shows that we can\u2019t give an argument from\n Dominance\n to the natural generalization of\n Consistency\\(_2\\)\n to arbitrarily many propositions; and we can only give the\ngeneralizations to \\(n\\) propositions, for some given \\(n\\), by\nbecoming increasingly conservative in our epistemic utilities\n(Fitelson & Easwaran 2015; Easwaran 2016).\n\nSay that a set of propositions is inconsistent if the propositions in\nit cannot all be true together. Then we have the following two\nnorms:\n\n\nConsistency\\(_n\\) If A is an\ninconsistent set of \\(n\\) or fewer propositions, then rationality\nrequires that you should not believe each proposition in\nA.\n\n\n\nConsistency If A is an inconsistent\nset of finitely many propositions, then rationality requires that you\nshould not believe each proposition in A.\n\n\nTake any \\(n\\) and suppose there is a lottery with \\(n\\) tickets in\nwhich each ticket is equally likely to be the winner. Let \\(L_i\\) be\nthe proposition that says the \\(i^\\mathrm{th}\\) ticket will lose. Then\nthe set of propositions \\(\\{L_1, \\ldots, L_n\\}\\) is inconsistent.\nNonetheless, if my credence in each \\(L_i\\) is \\(1 - \\frac{1}{n}\\), as\nit should be, and the Lockean threshold \\(t\\) is below \\(1 -\n\\frac{1}{n}\\), then the\n Lockean Thesis\n with threshold \\(t\\) says I must believe each member of this\nincoherent set. What\u2019s more, we know that believing each\nmaximizes expected epistemic utility from the point of view of those\ncredences, providing \\(\\frac{W}{R + W}\\) is less than \\(1 -\n\\frac{1}{n}\\). And we also know that no strongly dominated option can\never maximize expected utility. So, if \\(W \\lt (n-1)R\\), and therefore\n\\(\\frac{W}{R + W} \\lt 1 - \\frac{1}{n}\\), then it\u2019s possible to\nhave an inconsistent set of beliefs in \\(n\\) propositions that is not\ndominated. And this shows in turn that there can be no argument from\n Dominance\n to\n Consistency.\n For any \\(W \\gt R \\gt 0\\), there is some \\(n\\) such that\n\\(\\frac{W}{R+W} \\lt 1 - \\frac{1}{n}\\). On the other hand, if \\(n \\lt\n\\frac{R+W}{R}\\), then we can at least argue from\n Dominance\n to\n Consistency\\(_n\\),\n since the maximum epistemic utility of believing each of \\(n\\)\ninconsistent propositions is \\((n-1)R - W\\), which is always less than\nzero if \\(n \\lt \\frac{R+W}{R}\\).\n",
