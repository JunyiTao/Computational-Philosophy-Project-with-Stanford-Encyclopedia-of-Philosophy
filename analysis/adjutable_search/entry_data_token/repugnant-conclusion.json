Arriving at the Repugnant Conclusion\n\nParfit is not the first philosopher to have noticed that influential\nmoral views may have implications of the sort outlined in the\nRepugnant Conclusion. Henry Sidgwick was close to acknowledging the\nimplication when he pointed out that \u201c\u2026 the point up to\nwhich, on utilitarian principles, population ought to be encouraged to\nincrease, is not that at which the average happiness is the greatest\npossible\u2014as appears to be often assumed by political economists\nof the school of Malthus\u2014but that at which the happiness reaches\nits maximum\u201d (Sidgwick 1907 p. 418; for other early sources, see\nBroad 1930 pp. 249\u2013250; McTaggart 1927 pp. 452\u201353;\nNarveson 1967). However, it is Parfit who has brought the conclusion\nto recent philosophical attention both by stressing the importance of\nthe conclusion and by showing how difficult it is to avoid it (Parfit\n1984).\n\nParfit was led to the Repugnant Conclusion by his considerations\nconcerning how we ought to act in cases where our decisions have an\nimpact on who will exist in the future. Consider the following two\nscenarios (see Parfit 1984 chapter 16):\n\nA pregnant mother suffers from an illness which, unless she\nundergoes a simple treatment, will cause her child to suffer a\npermanent handicap. If she receives the treatment and is cured her\nchild will be perfectly normal.\nA woman suffers from an illness which means that, if she gets\npregnant now, her child will suffer from a permanent handicap. If she\npostpones her pregnancy a few months until she has recovered, her\nchild will be perfectly normal.\n\n\nWhat ought the women to do in the two cases? In case (1) the obvious\nanswer is that the mother ought to undergo the treatment since her\nchild will thereby get a better life. However, when we turn to case\n(2), it is problematic to appeal to the improved life of some child as\nthe reason for taking action (i.e., postponing the pregnancy). If the\nwoman postpones her pregnancy, then the child that is brought into\nexistence will not be identical to the child she would have had, had\nshe decided to become pregnant while she was ill (it will not be the\nsame ovum and sperm that meet). Hence, the alternative for the child\nbrought into existence during the mother\u2019s illness is\nnon-existence, and to claim that it would have been better for this\nchild if the mother had postponed pregnancy is tantamount to claiming\nthat the child\u2019s non-existence would have been better for the\nchild. Assuming that the child would have a life worth living, this\nseems wrong if not nonsensical. Indeed, in case (2), there are two\nhypothetical children and whether or not the mother postpones the\npregnancy, neither child will have a \u201cbetter life\u201d as a\nresult of the mother\u2019s action. For both hypothetical children,\nthe alternative is nonexistence. If the mother postpones her pregnancy\nwhile ill, the first child wouldn\u2019t exist, and if she\ndoesn\u2019t postpone, the second child wouldn\u2019t exist. (For a\ndiscussion, see Narveson 1967, Parfit 1984, appendix G; Adler 2012;\nBykvist 2007c, 2015; Arrhenius & Rabinowicz 2015, McMahan 1981,\n2009, 2013; Rabinowicz 2009; Holtug 2010; Fleurbaey & Voorhoeve\n2015). \n\nHow, if at all, should a change in the identity of the involved\nparties in the compared outcomes affect our moral evaluation? Parfit\nrefers to this as \u201cthe Non-Identity Problem\u201d (see the\nentry on\n the nonidentity problem).\n Following what would probably strike most people as the most\nplausible answer Parfit favors what he calls the \u201cNo-Difference\nView\u201d (1984 p. 367), which implies that a change in identity\nshould not affect the answer: the woman in case (2) ought to postpone\nher pregnancy, just as the woman in case (1) ought to undergo the\ntreatment. A straightforward way of capturing the No-Difference View\nis total utilitarianism according to which the best outcome is the one\nin which there would be the greatest quantity of whatever makes life\nworth living (Parfit 1984 p. 387). However, this view implies that any\nloss in the quality of lives in a population can be compensated for by\na sufficient gain in the quantity of a population; that is, it leads\nto the Repugnant Conclusion. Consider the following diagram:\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\nThe blocks above represent two populations, A and Z. The\nwidth of each block shows the number of people in the corresponding\npopulation, the height shows their quality of life or lifetime\nwelfare. All the lives in the above diagram have lives worth living.\nPeople\u2019s quality of life is much lower in Z than in\nA but, since there are many more people in Z, there is a\ngreater quantity of welfare in Z as compared to A.\nConsequently, although the people in A lead very good lives and\nthe people in Z have lives only barely worth living, Z\nis nevertheless better than A according to total\nutilitarianism. Thus, the attempt to provide a plausible solution to\nthe Non-Identity Problem has led to a seemingly unacceptable\nconclusion.\n\nLeaving the Non-Identity Problem aside, there are other arguments\nestablishing that the Repugnant Conclusion is not easily avoided.\nParfit has developed an argument to this effect. Consider the three\npopulation scenarios indicated in Fig. 2.\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\nIn population A, everybody enjoys a very high quality of life.\nIn population A+ there is one group of people as large as the\ngroup in A and with the same high quality of life. But\nA+ also contains a number of people with a somewhat lower\nquality of life. In Parfit\u2019s terminology A+ is generated\nfrom A by \u201cmere addition\u201d. Comparing A and\nA+ it is reasonable to hold that A+ is better than\nA or, at least, not worse. The idea is that an addition of\nlives worth living cannot make a population worse. Consider the next\npopulation B with the same number of people as A+, all\nleading lives worth living and at an average welfare level slightly\nabove the average in A+, but lower than the average in\nA. It is hard to deny that B is better than A+\nsince it is better in regard to both average welfare (and thus also\ntotal welfare) and equality. However, if A+ is at least not\nworse than A, and if B is better than A+, then\nB is also better than A given full comparability among\npopulations (i.e., setting aside possible incomparabilities among\npopulations). By parity of reasoning (scenario B+ and C,\nC+ etc.), we end up with a population Z in which all\nlives have a very low positive welfare. Thus, the final conclusion is\nthat Z is better than A, which is the Repugnant\nConclusion. By what apparently constitute sound steps of reasoning we\nhave arrived at an absurd conclusion. This is paradoxical. Thus, is\n\u2018mere\u2019 addition innocuous, as is here assumed? Well, if it\nis thought to be suspicious, there is a way of avoiding it by starting\nwith a population like the one in A and adding new people\nliving at a slightly lower level than the people in A in a\nmanner that increases the well-being of existing people. You\nthen proceed down the moral alphabet by levelling out the well-being\nbetween the best and worst off in a manner that gives more to those\nwho are worst off than you take from those who are best off; in each\nstep new people are added, in order to make this change of the\nsituation possible (Parfit 1984; T\u00e4nnsj\u00f6 2002). Moreover,\nthere are other abstract arguments leading in the same direction, some\nof them presented by Parfit himself (see section 2.5 and 2.7). It\nseems then that the Repugnant Conclusion is very hard to get\naround.\n\nThe main challenge which Parfit presented in his celebrated work\nReasons and Persons is to develop a theory of\nbeneficence\u2014theory X he calls it\u2014which is able to solve\nthe Non-Identity problem, which does not lead to the Repugnant\nConclusion and which thus manages to block the Mere Addition Paradox,\nwithout facing other unacceptable conclusions. However, Parfit\u2019s\nown conclusion was that he had not succeeded in developing such a\ntheory.\n\nIt might be tempting for people who have little sympathy with\nutilitarian thought to try to set the problems raised by the Repugnant\nConclusion to the side, thinking that it constitutes a problem only\nfor utilitarians. However, most people tend to believe that we have\nsome obligation to make the world a better place, at least if\nwe can do so without violating any deontological constraints, and at a\nnot too high cost to ourselves. Clearly all who think along these\nlines, even without being utilitarians, are faced with the problem of\nthe Repugnant Conclusion. We can assume that other values and\nconsiderations are not decisive for the choice between populations\nA and Z in Figure 1 (e.g., promises, rights). The\nRepugnant Conclusion is a problem for all moral theories which hold\nthat welfare at least matters when all other things are equal.\n2. Eight Ways of Dealing with the Repugnant Conclusion\n\nSeveral philosophers have taken up the challenge from Parfit and have\nengaged in considerations as to what would constitute a satisfactory\npopulation ethics. Some theorists have done so by accepting the\nframework Parfit has set for the investigation; that is, they have\ncarried on the work of developing an ethical theory that succeeds in\nmeeting Parfit\u2019s minimal requirements for adequacy. Other\ntheorists have been less willing to accept the scenery as set by\nParfit and have more or less radically challenged his requirements for\na plausible theory. The Repugnant Conclusion has been placed at the\ncentre of this discussion. The suggestions in the literature on how to\ndeal with the Repugnant Conclusion can roughly be divided into eight\ncategories: (1) introducing new ways of aggregating welfare into a\nmeasure of value; (2) questioning the way we can compare and measure\nwelfare; (3) counting welfare differently depending on temporal or\nmodal features; (4) revising the notion of a life worth living; (5)\nrejecting transitivity; (6) appeal to other values; (7) accepting the\nimpossibility of a satisfactory population ethics; (8) accepting the\nRepugnant Conclusion.\n2.1 Introducing new ways of aggregating welfare into a measure of value\n2.1.1 The average principle\n\nOne proposal that easily comes to mind when faced with the Repugnant\nConclusion is to reject total utilitarianism in favor of a principle\nprescribing that the average welfare per life in a population\nis maximized. Average utilitarianism and total utilitarianism are\nextensionally equivalent in the sense that they yield the same ranking\nwhen the compared populations are of the same size. They may differ\nsignificantly in different-number cases, however. This is easily seen\nwhen the average approach is adopted in the comparison of the\npopulations in Figure 1 and Figure 2. That the average well-being is\nall that matters implies that no loss in average well-being can be\ncompensated for by a gain in total well-being. Thus in Figure 1,\nA is preferable to Z, i.e., the Repugnant Conclusion is\navoided. In Figure 2, A is preferable to A+, i.e., the\nMere Addition Paradox is blocked at the very first step.\n\nDespite these advantages, average utilitarianism has not obtained much\nacceptance in the philosophical literature. This is due to the fact\nthat the principle has implications generally regarded as highly\ncounterintuitive. For instance, the principle implies that for any\npopulation consisting of very good lives there is a better population\nconsisting of just one person leading a life at a slightly higher\nlevel of well-being (Parfit 1984 chapter 19). More dramatically, the\nprinciple also implies that for a population consisting of just one\nperson leading a life at a very negative level of well-being, e.g., a\nlife of constant torture, there is another population which is better\neven though it contains millions of lives at just a slightly less\nnegative level of well-being (Parfit 1984). That total well-being\nshould not matter when we are considering lives worth ending is hard\nto accept. Moreover, average utilitarianism has implications very\nsimilar to the Repugnant Conclusion (see Sikora 1975; Anglin\n1977).\n2.1.2 Variable value principles\n\nAn attempt to produce a compromise between a total principle and an\naverage principle is provided by a variable value principle. The idea\nbehind this view is that the value of adding worthwhile lives to a\npopulation varies with the number of already existing lives in such a\nway that it has more value when the number of these lives is small\nthan when it is large (Hurka 1983, Ng 1989; Sider 1991). Taking this\nview, Noah\u2019s obligation to procreate after the Deluge was much\nstronger than our obligation today. Variable value principles are\nsometimes called \u201ccompromise theories\u201d since they can be\nsaid to be a compromise between total and average utilitarianism (for\na version that is sensitive to more aspects regarding welfare, see\nTemkin 1997, 2012). With small populations enjoying high welfare, a\nvariable value principle behaves like total utilitarianism and assigns\nmost of the value to the total sum of welfare. For large populations\nwith low welfare, the principle mimics average utilitarianism and\nassigns most of the value to average welfare. This property is what\nmakes it possible to avoid the Repugnant Conclusion. If the value of\nextra lives decreases asymptotically, then there may exist an upper\nlimit to the total value of a population (exactly as the sum of the\ninfinite series 1+1/2+1/4+ \u2026 has the upper limit 2). As long as\npopulation A in Fig. 1 has a total value above this limit this\npopulation will be preferable no matter how populous the low quality\npopulation Z is (Hurka 1983, Ng 1989; Sider 1991; Temkin 1997,\n2012).\n\nDepending on how precisely various different value principles are\nworked out they have different implications, which critics have\nregarded as devastating. For instance, on Ng\u2019s explication of\nthis view (Ng 1989) according to which the value of a population is\ndetermined by the product of the average welfare and a concave\ntransformation of the number of lives, it follows that it can be\nbetter to add people with negative welfare rather than positive\nwelfare to a population. More exactly, Ng\u2019s theory implies the\n\u201cSadistic Conclusion\u201d (Arrhenius 2000a): For any number of\nlives with any negative welfare (e.g. tormented lives), there are\nsituations in which it would be better to add these lives rather than\nsome number of lives with positive welfare. Moreover, even if it might\nbe reasonable to hold that the value of extra lives with positive\nwelfare decreases asymptotically towards a limit, the analogous\nassumption about lives with negative welfare isn\u2019t very\nattractive. Hence, given the reasonable assumption that the negative\nvalue of adding extra lives with negative welfare does not decrease\nrelatively to population size, a proportional expansion in the\npopulation size can turn a good population into a bad one\u2014a\nversion of the so-called \u201cAbsurd Conclusion\u201d (Parfit\n1984). A population of one million people enjoying very high positive\nwelfare and one person with negative welfare seems intuitively to be a\ngood population. However, since there is a limit to the positive value\nof positive welfare but no limit to the negative value of negative\nwelfare, proportional expansions (two million lives with positive\nwelfare and two lives with negative welfare, three million lives with\npositive welfare and three lives with negative welfare, and so forth)\nwill in the end yield a bad population.\n2.1.3 Critical level principles\n\nAnother way of modifying total utilitarianism is to introduce a\ncritical level (Kavka 1982, Parfit 1984; Locke 1984; Blackorby et\nal. 1997, 2004, 2005; Broome 2004). As is the case with the\nvariable value view, a critical level view is based on a split between\nprudential and moral value. However, in this case the split is even\nmore radical. The idea is that a person\u2019s life contributes\npositively to the value of a population only if the quality of the\nperson\u2019s life is above a certain positive critical level. Below\nthis level the contributive value of a life is neutral (Kavka 1982),\nnegative (Blackorby et al. 1997, 2004, 2005; cf.\nFeldman\u2019s theory below), or introduces incommensurability or\nvagueness in the ordering of populations (Blackorby et al.\n2005; Broome 2004; Rabinowicz 2009; cf. Parfit 2016), even though the\nperson leads a life worth living. In its simplest form, the critical\nlevel view is a modified version of total utilitarianism. The\ncontributive value of a person\u2019s life is her welfare minus a\npositive critical level. The value of a population is calculated by\nsumming these differences for all individuals in the population. The\ncritical level view thereby succeeds in avoiding the Repugnant\nConclusion. Assuming the critical level is higher than the individual\nwelfare levels in population Z, the Repugnant Conclusion is\nblocked since the value of Z is negative, and thus worse than\nA, according to the critical level view.\n\nAn obvious challenge to critical level thinking is to make clear what\nconstitutes the appropriate critical level. On the one hand, the level\nhas to be high enough to avoid versions of the Repugnant Conclusion;\non the other, the level has to be low enough not to rule out additions\nof clearly good lives (for an attempted answer to this challenge see\nBlackorby et al. 1997; Broome 2004). Critics have also been\nsceptical to the idea that the addition of lives worth living (albeit\nbelow the critical level) contribute negatively to the value of a\npopulation. Finally, it has been shown that this view leads to the\nSadistic Conclusion (see above).\n2.2 Questioning the way we can compare and measure welfare\n\nThe Repugnant Conclusion may seem to rely on a certain view about\nwelfare. It treats welfare on an additive scale, where low numbers, if\nadded to themselves often enough, must become larger than any initial\nlarger number. This is like the Archimedean property of the real\nnumbers: For any positive numbers x and y, there is\na natural number n such that nx is greater than\ny. Any finite number of lives in population A can\ntherefore be outweighed by a sufficiently large number of lives in\nZ because the gain in the quantity of lower values outweighs\nthe loss of certain higher values. However, some\ntheorists\u2014including Parfit\u2014have suggested that this\naxiological assumption is mistaken. (Parfit 1986, 2016; Griffin 1986;\nRachels 2001; Crisp 1988, 1992; Glover 1977; Edwards 1979; Lemos 1993;\nSkorupski 1999; Klint Jensen 1996; Portmore 1999; Riley 1993, 1999,\n2008, 2009). The idea is that one type of good \u03b1 can be superior\nto another type of good \u03b2, in the sense that any amount of\n\u03b1 is better than any amount of \u03b2 or that some amount of\n\u03b1 is better than any amount of \u03b2. Suppose that what happens\nas we move down the alphabet from the high-quality population A\nto the low-quality population Z is that the best things in life\nare gradually lost. For instance, as Parfit has suggested, the first\nstep from A to B involves the loss of Mozart\u2019s\nmusic; in the move from B to C Haydn\u2019s music is\nlost; in the move to D Venice is destroyed; and so on down the\nalphabet. All that is left in the final move to Z is\n\u201cmuzak and potatoes\u201d. The claim is that the lives in the\nbeginning of the sequence involve goods that are superior to the goods\ninvolved in the lives at the end of the sequence. The loss of the most\nworthwhile things in life cannot be compensated for by any gain in the\nquantity of muzak and potatoes. Consequently, whatever the number of\npeople in population Z, there will be less welfare, or less\nvaluable welfare, in this world as compared to population A and\nthus the Repugnant Conclusion is blocked.\n\nThis suggested way of blocking the Repugnant Conclusion obviously\npresupposes that the superiority view is justified in the first place\n(for a recent effort, see Parfit 2016). However, even if this is the\ncase, critics have suggested that this view may still be consistent\nwith some versions of the Repugnant Conclusion (e.g., Ryberg 1996b).\nMoreover, the superiority view has other implications that might be\nhard to accept. Assume that there are days of different qualities and\nthat these can be arranged in a descending sequence of goodness or how\nmuch they would contribute to the well-being of a life. It seems\nplausible that there can be such a sequence where the difference in\nquality of any two adjacent days in the sequence is marginal. For\nexample, consider two days of a life that only differ in respect to\none pin-prick in the left thumb. Assume now, as Parfit suggests, that\nthere are days of such quality that some number of these are better\nthan any number of days eating potatoes and listening to muzak. One\ncan then show (Arrhenius 2005; Klint Jensen 2008) that there must be\ntwo types of days, call them \u03b1-days and \u03b2-days, such that\nsome number of \u03b1-days is better than any number of \u03b2-days\nalthough the difference in quality between these days is only\nmarginal.\n2.3 Counting welfare differently depending on temporal or modal features\n\nAnother approach to the problems in population ethics has been the\nsuggestion that the crux of the problem resides in an all too\n\u201cimpersonal\u201d morality and that the problems of population\nethics can be solved by a shift to a so-called\n\u201cperson-affecting\u201d morality (Narveson 1967, 1976, 1978;\nRoberts 1998, 2002, 2004, 2007, 2011). This move has been especially\npopular in the context of medical ethics where many of the problems of\npopulation ethics are actualised. Examples are embryo or egg\nselection, pre-implantation genetic testing, assisted reproduction\nprograms, abortion, to mention just a few. The idea behind this\napproach is the contention\u2014sometimes referred to as \u201cthe\nperson-affecting restriction\u201d or simply \u201cthe\nslogan\u201d\u2014that an outcome can only be better (or worse) than\nanother if it is better (or worse) for someone (Narveson 1967: Glover\n1977; Temkin 1993a). If a quite strict interpretation of this\nrestriction is combined with the assumption that non-existence and\nexistence are incomparable in value for a person, we may derive a view\ncalled comparativism: We should disregard the welfare of\nuniquely realisable people, that is, people who only exist in one of\nthe compared outcomes (Heyd 1988; Bykvist 1998). A person-affecting\nmorality so understood deviates from impersonal morality in important\nrespects. If there is an overlap between the populations in A\nand Z, then A is ranked as better than Z since\nthe people existing in both populations are worse off in Z as\ncompared to A and since we should disregard the welfare of\nuniquely realisable people. However, if there are different people in\nthe involved populations, such as two future populations, then the two\npopulations are ranked as equally good or as incomparable in value,\nwhich is not a very satisfactory solution to the Repugnant Conclusion.\nMoreover, comparativism implies that any very huge loss in welfare for\nuniquely realisable people is compensated by any very small gain for\nnon-uniquely realisable people. Less strict interpretations of the\nperson-affecting restriction and comparativism can to a certain extent\navoid these problems, but at the price of implying the Repugnant\nConclusion again (Arrhenius 2009a; Holtug 2004).\n\nThe comparativist interpretation of the distinction between\n\u201cimpersonal\u201d and \u201cperson-affecting\u201d theories\nis not the only one proposed in the literature. What the different\ntheories that have been proposed under the banner of a\nperson-affecting morality have in common, however, are that they are\nwelfarist theories that count people\u2019s welfare differently\ndepending on the temporal location or the modal features of their\nlives. Apart from comparativists, we have presentists who\ndraw a distinction between presently existing people and non-existing\npeople (Narveson 1973; Heyd 1988); necessitarians who\ndistinguish between people who exist or will exist irrespective of how\nwe act and people whose existence is contingent on our choices (Singer\n1993); and actualists who differentiate between people that\nhave existed, exist or who are going to exist in the actual world, on\nthe one hand, and people who haven\u2019t, don\u2019t, and\nwon\u2019t exist, on the other (Bigelow and Pargetter 1988; Warren\n1978; Parson 2002; for a critical discussion of actualism, see Carlson\n1995; Arrhenius 2000b; Bykvist 1998, 2007b; Hare 2007; Howard-Snyder\n2008). These theories, apart from problems of their own, run into\nproblems analogous to the problems of comparativism discussed above.\nFor instance, presentism, in its strict guise according to which we\nonly take into account the welfare of presently existing people,\nimplies that any very small gain for present people outweighs any loss\nfor future people, irrespective of how big it is. Again, a less strict\ninterpretations of presentism (Dasgupta 1988, 1994) can to a certain\nextent avoid this and related problems, but at the price of implying\nthe Repugnant Conclusion again.\n\nActually, it is unclear whether presentism, necessitarianism, or\nactualism can escape any of the problems discussed above in connection\nwith \u201cimpersonal\u201d theories, and in particular the\nRepugnant Conclusion. For example, assume that A is a\npopulation of present people (for example, the present people in\ncountry x) enjoying very high welfare and that B is a\nlarger population of present people (for example, the present\npopulation in country y) with very low welfare but with\nhigher total welfare than A. Which population is the better one\naccording to presentism? It all depends on which method the presentist\nselects for determining better, worse and equally good in regard to\nthe welfare of present people. Since this case involves only present\npeople, all the problems discussed above will reappear in the search\nof this method. Likewise for necessitarianism and actualism. Moreover,\nthe restriction might not help us avoid the Repugnant Conclusion but\nrather imply it given some other attractive conditions (Arrhenius\n2015).\n2.4 Revising the notion of a life worth living\n\nThe above discussion of the Repugnant Conclusion presumes that there\nare possible lives with a very high quality of life. However,\nChristoph Fehige (1998) and David Benatar (2006) have suggested that\nthere are no lives enjoying positive welfare. Benatar claims that it\nis always worse for a person to begin to exist than never to have\nexisted. According to Fehige, only frustrated preferences count, and\nthey count negatively, whereas satisfied preferences have no positive\nvalue. These \u201cSchopenhauerian\u201d theories imply that there\nare no possible lives with positive welfare. On the contrary, most\nlives have negative welfare and the best possible lives only have\nneutral welfare.\n\nWould the truth of such a theory of welfare make the Repugnant\nConclusion acceptable? Yes in a way, since it would neutralise the\nRepugnant Conclusion by making it an empty truth. If there are no\npossible lives with a very high quality of life, then the Repugnant\nConclusion is vacuously true, since the antecedent\u2014\u201c[f]or\nany possible population \u2026 with a very high quality of\nlife\u201d\u2014is false of every possible population. Consequently,\ntotal utilitarianism would only imply the Repugnant Conclusion in a\ntrivial and uninteresting sense.\n\nHowever, the logic of Benatar\u2019s theory has been challenged\n(Bradley 2010) and a theory of welfare that denies the possibility of\nlives worth living is quite counter-intuitive (Ryberg 1996a).\nFehige\u2019s theory, for example, implies that a life of one year\nwith complete preference satisfaction has the same welfare as a\ncompletely fulfilled life of a hundred years, and has higher welfare\nthan a life of a hundred years with all preferences but one satisfied.\nMoreover, the last life is not worth living.\n2.5 Rejecting transitivity\n\nWhat makes the Repugnant Conclusion so perplexing is that strong\narguments can be given which apparently force one into accepting the\nconclusion. In fact, several arguments to this effect\u2014with\naffinity to the mere addition reasoning outlined above\u2014have been\npresented (see e.g. Parfit 1986; Arrhenius 2000b; Kitcher 2000;\nT\u00e4nnsj\u00f6 2002; Rachels 2004). Roughly, the arguments share\nthe following structure: in comparison between three population\nscenarios the second scenario is considered better than the first and\nthe third better than the second, leading to the conclusion that the\nthird scenario is better than the first. By iterated application of\nthis line of reasoning one ends up with the Repugnant Conclusion (that\nZ is better than A). One of the more radical approaches\nto such arguments has been to reject the transitivity of the relation\n\u201cbetter than\u201d (or \u201cequally as good as\u201d).\nAccording to transitivity, if p is better than q,\nand q is better than r, then p is better\nthan r. However, if transitivity of \u201cbetter than\u201d\nis denied then the reasoning leading the Repugnant Conclusion is\nblocked (Temkin 1987, 2012; Persson 2004; Rachels 2004).\n\nOne of the questions raised by this radical proposal is whether\narguments like the mere addition paradox themselves justify the\nrejection of transitivity or whether further arguments are needed\nsince transitivity seems to be part of the meaning and logic of the\nrelation \u201cbetter than\u201d (Broome 2004). However, it has been\nsuggested that there are two \u201cbetter than\u201d-concepts, one\nbased on intrinsic value and one based on the stance that one ought to\ntake towards the evaluated objects (Arrhenius 2004; Rabinowicz 2012).\nThe former is transitive in virtue of its meaning whereas the latter\nis non-transitive over different alternative sets, just like\n\u201cought to be chosen\u201d. Moreover, Temkin (2012) argues that\nit is the latter \u201cbetter than\u201d-concept which is the\nimportant one for practical reasoning. This raises the question of the\nmore general implications of this proposal for morality and practical\nreasoning and some worry that giving up the transitivity of\n\u201cbetter than\u201d would demand a major revision of our notion\nof practical reasoning (Temkin 1987, 2012). A transitive preference\nordering has usually been assumed as part of the definition of a\nrational agent in economic and rational choice theory. For example, it\nseems that an agent with a non-transitive preference ordering can be\nexploited by a so-called \u2018money-pump\u2019 (see Section 5.1 of\nthe entry on the\n philosophy of economics).\n The main problem with non-transitive value orderings in moral theory,\nhowever, is that such an ordering cannot form the basis of a\nsatisfactory answer to the question of what one ought to choose.\nCoupled with the standard formulation of consequentialism (an action\nis right if and only if its outcome is at least as good as the\noutcomes of all the alternative actions, see the entry on\n consequentialism),\n for example, we get the counterintuitive result that no action is\nright in the mere addition paradox. Moreover, it has been shown that\nthe mere addition argument and the like can be reconstructed on the\nnormative level, in terms of what one ought to choose, without an\nappeal to transitivity (Arrhenius 2004). Instead of an non-transitive\nordering of populations, one gets a situation in which all of the\navailable actions are forbidden, i.e., a moral dilemma. Hence, it\ndoesn\u2019t look like we can exorcise the paradoxes of population\nethics by giving up some formal condition like the transitivity of\n\u201cbetter than\u201d.\n2.6 Appeal to other values\n\nFred Feldman has proposed a desert-adjusted version of utilitarianism,\n\u2018justicism\u2019 which he claims avoids the Repugnant\nConclusion (Feldman 1997). In justicism, the value of an episode of\npleasure is determined not only by the hedonic level but also by the\nrecipient\u2019s desert level. Feldman\u2019s proposal is that there\nis some level of happiness that people deserve merely in virtue of\nbeing people. He assumes that this level corresponds to 100 units of\npleasure and that people with very low welfare enjoy only one unit of\npleasure. He suggests that the life of a person who deserves 100 units\nof pleasure and receives exactly that amount of pleasure has an\nintrinsic value of 200, whereas the life of a person deserving 100\nunits but who only receives one unit of pleasure has an intrinsic\nvalue of \u221249. It follows that any population consisting of\npeople with very low welfare and desert level 100 has negative value,\nwhereas any population with very high welfare has positive value.\nConsequently, it seems as if justicism avoids the Repugnant\nConclusion. Moreover, the intuition behind Feldman\u2019s explanation\nof the unacceptability of the Repugnant Conclusion\u2014that there is\nsome level of welfare that people deserve merely in virtue of being\npeople\u2014is compelling and probably widely shared and could give\nsupport to ideas such as the critical level view discussed above.\n\nIt has been pointed out, however, that Feldman\u2019s reasoning\ninvolves a questionable interpretation of the ceteris paribus\nclause in the repugnant conclusion (Arrhenius 2003). He implicitly\nassumes that the ceteris paribus clause is satisfied whenever\nthe people in the compared populations have the same desert level. A\nmore plausible reading of the ceteris paribus clause is that\nit is satisfied if and only if the compared populations are (roughly)\nequally good in regard to all other axiologically relevant aspects\napart from welfare, including their \u201cdesert value\u201d. Hence,\nto satisfy the ceteris paribus clause, the compared\npopulations should be equally good in regard to desert, that is,\nequally good in regard to the contributive value of the fit between\nwhat people deserve and what they get. Given this interpretation of\nthe ceteris paribus clause, justicism does imply the\nrepugnant conclusion. If A and Z are equally good in\nregard to desert, then justicism ranks Z as better than\nA since Z has greater total well-being.\n\nOne might also try to solve the Mere Addition Paradox by an appeal to\negalitarian considerations. Consider population A and A+\nin figure 2 again. According to a well-known principle, Maximin, we\nshould rank populations according to the welfare of the worst off: The\nlower the welfare of the worst off, the worse the population. Maximin\nranks A+ as worse than A and thus stops the Mere\nAddition Paradox in its first step. However, Maximin has a number of\nother counterintuitive implications in population ethics since it\nimposes a kind of dictatorship of the worst off according to which the\nslightest gain in welfare for one of the worst of person outweighs a\nvery large loss for any number of better off people.\n\nStill, A+ is clearly more unequal than A, and it\nisn\u2019t unreasonable to claim that A+ is in this respect\nworse than A. For example, according to Temkin (1993a, p. 200),\n\u201cthe ultimate intuition underlying egalitarianism is that it is\nbad \u2026 for some to be worse off than others through no fault of\ntheir own\u201d. Clearly, this is the case in A+ since the\nextra people have not done anything to deserve to be worse off than\nthe better off people. Moreover, as suggested by Temkin, one might\nhold the view that the greater the number of worst off, the worse the\ninequality. (Temkin 1993a, p. 200\u20132). Consequently, since the\nnumber of worse off extra people in the Mere Addition Paradox has to\nbe enormous to reach the Z population (see figure 1) by\nredistribution of welfare, the inequality involved would be\nconsiderable. Hence, there seems to be a prima facie case that\negalitarian concerns can solve the Mere Addition Paradox. \n\nThe crucial question, however, is whether inequality makes A+\nworse than A all things considered. Since A+ is clearly\nbetter than A in respect to total welfare, the pluralist\negalitarian has to limit the importance of total welfare relative to\nthe importance of inequality to reach this judgement. There are some\npromising ways the pluralist egalitarian could do this albeit it is as\nyet unclear whether these proposals will stand up to further scrutiny.\nMore problematic for the egalitarian approach, however, is that the\nRepugnant Conclusion can be derived from conditions to which an\negalitarian has no decisive objections (T\u00e4nnsj\u00f6 2008;\nArrhenius 2009b). \n2.7 Accepting the impossibility of a satisfactory population ethics\n\nEven though Parfit, despite his thorough investigations in Reason\nand Person, did not succeed in finding the sought-after ethical\nTheory X that would avoid the Repugnant Conclusion and other equally\nunattractive conclusions, this did not seem to destroy his hopes that\nsuch a theory could be found (Parfit 1984 p. 451). However, other\ntheorists have regarded the search for this theory as having more\ngloomy prospects. This pessimism has been given a more formal content.\nIt has been held that it can be proven that there is no population\nethics that satisfies a set of apparently plausible adequacy\nconditions on such a theory. In fact, several such proofs have been\nsuggested (Arrhenius 2000b, 2011). What such a theorem would show\nabout ethics is not quite clear. Arrhenius has suggested that an\nimpossibility theorem leaves us with three options: (1) to abandon\nsome of the conditions on which the theorem is based; (2) to become\nmoral sceptics; or (3) to try to explain away the significance of the\nproofs\u2014alternatives which do not invite an easy choice (cf.\nTemkin 2012).\n2.8 Accepting the Repugnant Conclusion\n\nWhen confronted with the Repugnant Conclusion, many share the view\nthat the conclusion is highly counterintuitive. However, it has been\nsuggested that it is premature to conclude from this that the\nconclusion is morally unacceptable. Two sorts of reasons can be given\nin favor of the view that the conclusion should be accepted. According\nto the first, while it is correct that the conclusion is\ncounterintuitive, there are nevertheless certain theoretical\nconsiderations outweighing this intuition to such an extent that we\nshould accept it. The claim that no plausible theory can avoid the\nRepugnant Conclusion or that the rejection of the conclusion would\nforce one into rejecting claims which it is hard to get\naround\u2014e.g. such as the premises of the Mere Addition\nParadox\u2014may constitute such considerations (T\u00e4nnsj\u00f6\n2002; Holtug 2004; Huemer 2008). According to the second, the source\nof the unacceptability of the conclusion is the fact that we are\ndeluded by our intuition (Sikora 1978, 2004; Mackie 1985;\nT\u00e4nnsj\u00f6 1992, 1998, 2002; Hare 1993; Ryberg 1996a, 2004).\nOnce we fully understand what the conclusion amounts to, we will cease\nto find it counterintuitive. For instance, it might be suggested that\nthe repugnance, at least partly, is due to our limited apprehension of\nlarge numbers (T\u00e4nnsj\u00f6 2002; Broome 2004). We cannot imagine\nwhat it would be like for there to exist billions upon billions of\npeople, and hence our intuition is not based on a sound picture of the\nmoral significance of population Z (for a critical discussion\nof these kind of arguments, see Temkin 2012 and Pummer 2013).\nMoreover, several theorists have suggested that our intuition is\nmisguided by a misapprehension of what it is like to lead a life in\nZ, i.e., a life that is barely worth living. The idea is that\nonce we realize that such a life is not terrible but perhaps a life\nnot much different from a normal privileged one, the conclusion loses\nits sting (Mackie 1985; T\u00e4nnsj\u00f6 1992; Ryberg 1996a). Thus,\non both views, though population ethics may constitute a complicated\narea of ethical research, it is at least devoid of what is\ntraditionally regarded as one of the cardinal challenges.\n\nHowever, this conclusion might not be much of a comfort since there\nare other impossibility results that do not rely on avoidance of the\nRepugnant Conclusions as one of its adequacy condition but on\navoidance of the intuitively even more unacceptable Very Repugnant\nConclusion: For any perfectly equal population with very high positive\nwelfare, and for any number of lives with any very negative welfare,\nthere is a population consisting of the lives with negative welfare\nand lives with very low positive welfare which is better than the high\nwelfare population, other things being equal (Arrhenius 2011). This\nconclusion seems much harder to accept than the Repugnant Conclusions.\nHere we are comparing one population where everybody enjoys very high\nquality of life with another population where people either have very\nlow positive welfare or very negative welfare (any level of horrible\nsuffering). Even if we were to accept the Repugnant Conclusion, we are\nnot forced to accept the Very Repugnant Conclusion. We might, for\nexample, accept the former but not the latter because we give greater\nmoral weight to suffering than to happiness. Hence, to exorcise the\nparadoxes of population ethics, it is not sufficient to show that our\nintuition about the Repugnant Conclusion is wrong or epistemically\nunreliable. We also have to show that this is true of the Very\nRepugnant Conclusion, which might strike many as quite a tall\norder.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Adler, M., 2012, <em>Well-Being and Fair Distribution: Beyond\nCost-Benefit Analysis</em>, Oxford: Oxford University Press.", "Anglin, B., 1977, \u201cThe Repugnant Conclusion,\u201d\n<em>Canadian Journal of Philosophy</em>, 7 (4): 745\u2013754.", "Arrhenius, G., 2000a, \u201cAn Impossibility Theorem for\nWelfarist Axiology\u201d, <em>Economics and Philosophy</em>, 16:\n247\u2013266.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2000b, <em>Future Generations: A Challenge\nfor Moral Theory</em>, F.D.
