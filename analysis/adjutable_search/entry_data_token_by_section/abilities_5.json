    "main_text": "Two fundamental distinctions || Abilities and ability-ascriptions\n2.2 Abilities and ability-ascriptions\n\nMuch philosophical discussion of ability has taken place in the\nformal, as opposed to the material, mode. Thus we are often asked to\ndistinguish senses of \u2018ability\u2019, or to think\nabout what \u2018can\u2019 means. This subtle shift between\ndiscussing ability and discussing the ascription of ability is often\nharmless. Nonetheless, it is important to bear in mind the distinction\nbetween these questions, and to mark this distinction explicitly at\nthe outset.\n\nOn the one hand, there are questions about ability itself. The central\nquestion here to give an account of what an ability is, in the sense\nforegrounded at the outset. Subsidiary questions here include, for\nexample, whether abilities may exist when they are unexercised,\nwhether abilities are intrinsic or extrinsic features of their\nbearers, and whether agents have abilities in deterministic worlds.\nThese are, broadly speaking, questions about the metaphysics of\nability.\n\nOn the other hand, there are questions about ability-ascriptions.\nAbilities are characteristically ascribed (in English) with sentences\ninvolving the modal auxiliaries \u2018can\u2019 and \u2018is able\nto.\u2019 Accordingly, the central question here is to give a\nsemantics for sentences involving those expressions. Subsidiary tasks\ninclude resolving certain open problems in the semantics of these\nexpressions, such as the \u2018actuality entailment\u2019 observed\nin (Bhatt 1999), and integrating a semantics for agentive modals with\na semantics for modal expressions more generally. These are, broadly\nspeaking, questions about the semantics of agentive modality.\n\nOn certain conceptions of the philosophical enterprise, the project of\ngiving a theory of ability and that of giving a semantics for\nability-ascriptions are closely connected, and even collapse into each\nother. Nonetheless, there is at least a methodological distinction to\nbe marked here. Having marked that distinction, this discussion will\nprimarily be concerned with the first of these projects, the project\nof giving a theory of ability. Nonetheless, the project of giving a\nsemantics for ability-ascriptions will also frequently be relevant. As\nwith the distinction between general and specific abilities, this is\nfor two reasons, one of coverage and one more properly\nphilosophical.\n\nThe first reason, that of coverage, is the following. Many of the most\nprominent theories of ability defended in the philosophical literature\nhave in fact been, in the first place, theories of\nability-ascriptions. Indeed, the central thought in much work on\nability in the analytic tradition has been a kind of semantic\ndeflationism, on which we may give a semantics for ability-ascriptions\nthat does not quantify over abilities themselves. This is arguably the\nmain theme of the hypothetical theories to be considered in Section 3,\nand the modal theories to be considered in Section 4. Given this\ntendency in thinking about ability, an overview of philosophical work\non ability that neglected the role of ability-ascriptions would be\nseriously incomplete.\n\nThere is also the second, more philosophical, reason. Any account of\nabilities owes us, among other things, an account of\nability-ascriptions. This is perhaps true of philosophical topics\ngenerally, but it is true of ability in particular. Even philosophers\nwho are explicit in their \u2018refusal to take language as a\nstarting point in the analysis of thought and modality\u2019 (Lewis\n1986, xi) are prone to make explicit appeal to language when the topic\nturns to ability, as occurs in (Lewis 1976) or (Taylor 1960). This is\nfor any number of reasons, but perhaps especially because it is\ndifficult to even identify the topic under consideration without using\nor mentioning certain phrases, notably \u2018can\u2019 and \u2018is\nable to.\u2019\n\nHappily, the topic of ability-ascriptions is one on which linguists\nand philosophers have made significant progress. While there has long\nbeen considerable philosophical interest expressions such as\n\u2018can\u2019 and \u2018is able to,\u2019\u00a0there is nothing\nrecognizable as a rigorous semantic theory of such terms prior to the\nfoundational work of Angelika Kratzer, recently revised and collected\nin (Kratzer 2012). Kratzer\u2019s work has been central to natural\nlanguage semantics, and its significance for philosophical work is\nstill being appreciated. The question of whether it is correct as an\naccount of the semantics of agentive modality is an open one:\nimportant challenges include (Hackl 1998) and, more recently,\n(Mandelkern, Schultheis, and Boylan, 2017), (Schwarz 2020), and\n(Willer forthcoming). The Kratzer semantics, and a view of ability on\nwhich that semantics plays a foundational role, will be considered in\nsome detail in Section 4. The more methodological point being made\nhere is that any adequate account of ability ought to provide an\naccount of ability-ascriptions, and as such may want to reckon with\nthis ongoing debate in the semantics of modal expressions.\n",
