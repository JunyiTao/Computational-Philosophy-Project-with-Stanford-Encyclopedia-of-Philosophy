    "main_text": "Neuroscience of Generic Consciousness: Unconscious Vision as Case Study || Unconscious Vision and the Intentional Action Inference\n4.3 Unconscious Vision and the Intentional Action Inference\n\nBlindsight and DF show that damage to specific regions of the brain\ndisrupts normal visual processing, yet subjects can access visual\ninformation in preserved visual circuits to inform behavior despite\nfailing to report on the relevant visual contents. The received view\nis that these subjects demonstrate unconscious vision. One implication\nis that the normal processing in the ventral stream, tied to normal V1\nactivity, plays a necessary role in normal conscious vision. Another\nis that dorsal stream processing or visual stream processing that\nbypasses V1 via subcortical processing yields only unconscious visual\nstates. This points to a set of networks that begin to provide an\nanswer to what makes visual states conscious or not. An important\nfurther step will be to integrate these results with the general\ntheories noted earlier\n (section 3).\n\nStill, the complexities of the empirical data bring us back to\nmethodological issues about tracking consciousness and the following\nquestion: What behavioral data should form the basis of attributions\nof phenomenal consciousness? The intentional action inference is used\nin a variety of cases to attribute conscious states, yet the results\nof the previous sections counsel us to be wary of applying that\ninference widely. After all, some intentional behavior might be\nunconsciously guided.\n\nIn the case of DF, we noted that unlike many other visual agnosics,\nshe can direct motor actions towards stimuli that she cannot\nexplicitly report and which she denies seeing. In her case, we\nprioritize introspective reports over intentional action as evidence\nfor unconscious vision. Yet, one might take a broader view that vision\nfor action is always conscious and that what DF vividly illustrates is\nthat some visual contents (dorsal stream) are tied directly to\nperformance of intentional motor behavior and are not directly\navailable to conceptual capacities deployed in report. In contrast, other\naspects of conscious vision, supported by the ventral stream, are directly available to\nguide reports. This functional divergence is explained by the\nanatomical division in cortical visual processing.\n\nFor some time now, these striking cases have been taken as clear cases\nof unconscious vision and if this hypothesis is correct, the work has\nbegun to identify visual areas critical for creating seeing, sometimes\nconscious and sometimes not. The neuroanatomy demonstrates that\nvisually-guided behavior has a complex neural basis involving cortical\nand subcortical structures that demonstrate a substantial level of\nspecialization. Understanding consciousness and unconsciousness in\nvision will need to be sensitive to the complexities of the underlying\nneural substrate.\n",
