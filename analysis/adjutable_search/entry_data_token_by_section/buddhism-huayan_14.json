    "main_text": "Later Developments and Influence || Neo-Confucianism\n8.2 Contemporary Huayan\n\nHuayan Buddhism has largely died out as a distinct religious movement\nin China, Korea, and Japan; however, Huayan texts continue to be\nstudied and have been particularly influential on Chan Buddhism (Jap.\nZen). Huayan has also had a substantial influence on other\nphilosophies. The so-called \u201cNew Confucian Manifesto\u201d\nadvocates the \u201crounded and spiritual wisdom\u201d of the East\nas opposed to the \u201csquare\u201d wisdom of the West (see Harris\n(trans.), Part 11, Other Internet Resources). Although they identify\nthe ultimate source of this distinction as the Classic of\nChanges, their description of it is reminiscent of the\n\u201cround\u201d wisdom advocated by\npanjiao theorists. In addition, Mou Zongsan, one of the\nco-authors of the \u201cManifesto,\u201d wrote extensively and\nsympathetically about Huayan. Among contemporary philosophers, Graham\nPriest (2015) has shown how to formalize the ontology of Huayan using\nnon-standard set theory. \n",
