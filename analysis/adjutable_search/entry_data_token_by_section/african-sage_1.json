    "main_text": "The African Sage Tradition and Eurocentric Bias\n2. The African Sage Tradition and Eurocentric Bias\n\nFirst, Oruka was concerned about the picture created under colonialism\nthat, while the sayings of numerous Greek sages such as Thales,\nAnaximander, Heraclitus, and other pre-Socratics, were regarded as\n\u201cphilosophical,\u201d those of traditional African sages were\nnot. This bias arises out of the implicit belief that philosophy is\nthe privileged activity of certain races. He believed that this\nunjustified belief had further led to the image of philosophy as the\nrestricted property of Greeks, or Europeans, and, even more\nexclusively, the property of white males. Partly concerned with\nexposing the falsehood of this Eurocentric attitude, he recognized\nthat what had raised the apparently simple sayings of the\npre-Socratics to the status of philosophy was the subsequent sustained\ncommentaries by later philosophers. He maintained that the ideas\nexpressed by indigenous African sages were no different from those by\nthe earlier Greeks. When recorded later in books, the sayings of Greek\nsages came to be widely regarded as \u201cphilosophical,\u201d and\nthe people who produced them as \u201cphilosophers.\u201d Given such\na scenario, Oruka was led to wonder, why would the sayings of Akoko,\nor those of Chaungo, for example, not be similarly regarded after they\nare committed to writing by a professional philosopher?\n\nOruka supports his comparison of indigenous African sages with the\npre-Socratics by citing two methods that have contributed to the\ngrowth of philosophy in the West, beginning with its Greek roots. One\ndirect method of using dialogues is exemplified in the early Platonic\nworks. Socrates asks primary questions upon which the exposition of\nideas by his interlocutor is based. Oruka viewed his own dialogues\nwith the sages as an example of this practice in the African context.\nSocrates regarded himself as a \u201cmid-wife\u201d of sorts,\nbecause he merely helped those with the knowledge to bring it out. He\nbrought out what was in each case really the property of his\ninterlocutors, not his own. Oruka meant his dialogues, in similar\nfashion, to capture both this method and its outcome. He maintained\nthat the sages he and his disciples interviewed were the owners of\ntheir own ideas. The Western-trained philosopher, he says,\n\u201cplays the role of philosophical provocation\u201d (Sage\nPhilosophy, p. 47). The other method, exemplified in the later\nPlatonic works, involves indirect engagement with the sayings of the\nsages through a commentary on their ideas \u2014 derived from these\ndialogues, or from general acquaintance with the sages\u2019 views. Oruka\nbelieved that, by these two methods, the growth of African philosophy\ncan take place in a manner similar to the growth of Western\nphilosophy. Underlying Oruka\u2019s position was his hope that trained\nphilosophers, regardless of their origins, could take on the sages on\ntheir claims in their commentaries and critiques as this is how\nadvancement and growth of knowledge partly takes place. This is to\nsay, in hindsight, that even in Oruka\u2019s own view the sayings of the\nsages were not free of critique.\n",
