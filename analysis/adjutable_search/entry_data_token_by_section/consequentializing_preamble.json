    "main_text": "\n\nAct-consequentialism is one of today\u2019s leading moral theories.\nBroadly construed, it holds that the ultimate right-making feature of\nan act is that its outcome is not evaluatively outranked by that of\nany available alternative. To evaluatively rank (hereafter, simply\n\u201crank\u201d) a set of outcomes is to rank them along some\nevaluative dimension, such as their overall goodness, their goodness\nfor the agent, their goodness for others besides the agent, or some\ncombination of such things. And when we combine act-consequentialism\nwith different ways of ranking outcomes, we get different versions of\nact-consequentialism. For instance, Benthamite utilitarianism (Bentham\n1789) combines act-consequentialism with the view that outcomes are to\nbe ranked in terms of their overall goodness and that the overall\ngoodness of an outcome is simply a function of the intensities and\ndurations of the pleasures and pains that it contains. On this theory,\nagents must always maximize hedonic utility\u2014the net\nbalance of pleasure over pain for all concerned. By contrast, ethical\negoism (Shaver 2002 [2021]) is an act-consequentialist theory that\nranks outcomes in terms of how good they are for the agent.\nIt holds that one outcome outranks another if and only if it is better\nfor the agent. And, so, ethical egoism implies that an agent ought to\nproduce the outcome that\u2019s best for themself even if it\u2019s\nworse overall. In contrast to these two, self/other utilitarianism\n(Sider 1993: 128) holds that one outcome outranks another if and only\nif it outranks the other both in terms of how good it is and in terms\nof how good it is for others besides the agent. On this view, an agent\nmay perform an act whose outcome is worse than that of some available\nalternative so long as that outcome is worse only for themself. And\nthese three are but a few of the possibilities.\n\nAlthough there are many ways to rank outcomes and, consequently, many\nversions of act-consequentialism, Benthamite utilitarianism\n(hereafter, simply \u201cutilitarianism\u201d) is its archetypal and\nprototypical form. The problem is that few are willing to accept it\ngiven its counterintuitive implications, including the following:\n\nwe ought to lobotomize people if this would maximize hedonic\nutility by enabling them to enjoy simple bodily pleasures free of\nintellectual discontent,\nwe are required to sacrifice our own lives to save the lives of\nothers even if this would produce only slightly more hedonic utility\noverall, and\nwe are permitted to maim, torture, and even kill innocent people\nso long as doing so would produce more (perhaps, only slightly more)\nhedonic utility.\n\n\nYet, despite such counterintuitive implications, utilitarianism tends\nto haunt even those of us who refuse to accept it, for there seems to\nbe something quite compelling about its act-consequentialism (Berker\n2013: 364; Foot 1985: 196; Korsgaard 1993 [1996: 225]). Of course,\nwhat exactly, if anything, is so compelling about it is controversial\nand, thus, something that we\u2019ll need to consider below.\n\nGiven this putative tension between the attractiveness of\nact-consequentialism and the unattractiveness of its archetype\u2019s\nimplications, a potentially promising research project is to come up\nwith a version of act-consequentialism that avoids\nutilitarianism\u2019s counterintuitive implications. Given that many\nstandard versions of non-consequentialism (including standard versions\nof Kantianism, virtue ethics, and theological voluntarism) avoid many,\nif not all, of utilitarianism\u2019s counterintuitive implications,\nwe could do this by constructing a ranking of outcomes that, when\ncombined with act-consequentialism, yields the same (or nearly the\nsame) deontic verdicts that one of these non-consequentialist theories\ndelivers. This is to consequentialize that\nnon-consequentialist theory. (Note that deontic verdicts are verdicts\nsuch as \u201cright\u201d, \u201cobligatory\u201d,\n\u201cpermissible\u201d, \u201csupererogatory\u201d, \u201cought\nto be performed\u201d, etc. Unlike evaluative verdicts such as\n\u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbetter\u201d, which are directly\nnormative only for what we should desire/prefer, deontic verdicts are\nalso directly normative prospectively for what we should do/intend and\nretrospectively for whom we should blame/praise.)\n\nTo illustrate, consider theological voluntarism\u2014the view that\nthe ultimate right-making feature of an action is that it accords with\nGod\u2019s will. And let\u2019s consider the version that holds that\nGod wills that we abide by the Ten Commandments. To consequentialize\nthis non-consequentialist theory, we need to replace its account of\nthe ultimate right-maker with one that holds instead that the ultimate\nright-making feature of an act is that its outcome is not outranked by\nthat of any available alternative and that one outcome outranks\nanother if and only if the agent refrains from violating the Ten\nCommandments in the one but not the other. This act-consequentialist\ncounterpart theory yields the same set of deontic verdicts that this\nversion of theological voluntarism delivers\u2014e.g., that\nit\u2019s obligatory to honor your parents and wrong to both lie and\ncommit murder. But this counterpart theory is a version of\nact-consequentialism as opposed to theological voluntarism because it\nholds that the feature of lying that ultimately makes it wrong is, not\nthat God wills us to refrain from lying, but that the outcome in which\nthe agent lies is outranked by the outcome in which they neither lie\nnor violate any other commandment.\n\nThus, to consequentialize a non-consequentialist theory, we combine\nact-consequentialism with a ranking of outcomes such that the\nresulting act-consequentialist counterpart theory yields, in every\npossible world, the same (or nearly the same) deontic verdicts that\nthe target non-consequentialist theory yields. Historically, this has\nmost often been done in the hopes of coming up with a version of\nact-consequentialism that avoids most, if not all, of\nutilitarianism\u2019s counterintuitive implications. And this project\nis often called \u201cthe consequentializing project\u201d\n(Portmore 2007; S. A. Schroeder 2017; Suikkanen 2020). But, as\nwe\u2019ll see below, some contemporary philosophers consequentialize\nfor other reasons. Indeed, there are three different types of\nconsequentializing and, consequently, three distinct\nconsequentializing projects. And, so, when we consider various\nobjections to consequentializing below, we\u2019ll need to be careful\nnot to conflate them, as many of these objections apply only to\ncertain types of consequentializing.\n",
