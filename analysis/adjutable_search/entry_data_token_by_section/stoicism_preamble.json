The name derives from the porch (stoa\npoikil\u00ea) in the Agora at Athens decorated with mural\npaintings, where the first generation of Stoic philosophers\ncongregated and lectured. The school of thought founded there long\noutlived the physical Athenian porch and notably enjoyed continued\npopularity in the Roman period and beyond. This entry introduces the\nmain doctrines and arguments of the three parts of Stoic philosophy\n\u2013 physics, logic, and ethics \u2013 emphasizing their\ninterlocking structure. We also review the history of the school, the\nextant sources for Stoic doctrine, and the Stoics\u2019 subsequent\nphilosophical influence.\n",
