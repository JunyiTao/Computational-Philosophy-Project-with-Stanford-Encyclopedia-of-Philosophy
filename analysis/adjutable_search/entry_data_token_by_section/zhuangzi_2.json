    "main_text": "A Modern Philosophical Interpretation || Relativism: It depends on \u2026\n4.5 Relativism: It depends on \u2026\nThe Zhuangzi emphasizes the plurality of natural stances\nor points of view from which one may see paths of possible behavior as\n\u201cnatural.\u201d For one of the paths to be available for\nme will be dependent on where I am and my given\ntrajectory in the network. All the appeals to\nti\u0101nnature as an authority are right in\ninsisting their d\u00e0os are natural, but mistaken in\nusing that as a reason to deny a similar status to the\nd\u00e0os of rival normative thinkers. Ti\u0101n\ncannot serve as an arbiter of which rival norm is correct since it\nequally \u201cpuffs\u201d all of them out. This allows each to claim\ntheir choices are of ti\u0101nnatural\nd\u00e0os but does not allow them the corollary that their\nrival\u2019s choices violate ti\u0101n. They, like us,\nconform with ti\u0101n\u2019s constancies in being committed\nto their d\u00e0os.  \n\nAny\nsh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis:right judgment concerning\na d\u00e0o may be either a \u56e0\ny\u012bndependent sh\u00ec, based on\nprior or enacted commitments, gestalts orientations, and inner\nprocesses or it may be an arbitrary posited (\u70ba\nw\u00e8ido:deem) sh\u00ec. Dependency\narises from past (ch\u00e9ngfixed) commitments\nto the d\u00e0o structures through which we worked our way\nto our here-now. We always encounter such choices as we are\nalready engaged in walking along some d\u00e0o. Those past\nd\u00e0o commitments bring us to a normative stance from\nwhich successive judgments of sh\u00ec-f\u0113i and\n\u53ef k\u011bpermissible vs. not\nk\u011b arise.  Zhuangzi\u2019s pivotal illustration pairs\n\u662f sh\u00ecthis with \u5f7c\nb\u01d0that as near and far indexicals. His use of\nanother indexical here signals his view that \u662f\nsh\u00ecthis:right used normatively as opposite\nto \u975e f\u0113inot-that:wrong is relative to\na commitment index.\n\nLocal justifications for having\nsh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that or\nk\u011bassertible are delivered in accordance our\nch\u00e9ngfixed commitment momentum along the\nd\u00e0os that guided us to this point. This relativity of\nnormative dependence underpins Zhuangzi\u2019s mildly ironic,\nskepticism of special or extraordinary normative statuses we give to,\ne.g., sages. The skepticism must apply even to the quietist posture that\nsh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that judgments are\n\u201cbad\u201d or unnatural. We should doubt any transcendent or\nallegedly perfect, totalistic epistemic access to nature\u2019s\ninexpressible normative know-how. There are no naturally ideal\nobservers.\n\n\nWill the eventual result be there is both \u662f\nsh\u00ecthis:right and \u5f7c\nb\u01d0that?\u00a0 Will the eventual result be there is\nneither sh\u00ec nor b\u01d0? We can call the situation of neither\nsh\u00ec nor f\u0113i finding its opposite the\n\u201cpivot of \u9053 d\u00e0oguides.\u201d\nThe pivot sets the start of the center of a sphere from which there\nare inexhaustible responses\u2014inexhaustible sh\u00ec\nand inexhaustible f\u0113i.\u00a0 Hence the saying\n\u201cnothing matches \u660e\nm\u00edngdiscernment.\u201d (Ibid., HY\n4/2/30\u201331)\n\nThis cautious skepticism undergirds Zhuangzi\u2019s departure from\nthe primitivists\u2019. He neither thinks we should conclude that we\nmust not issue sh\u00ec-f\u0113i judgments nor that we must\nreject or deny our natural, situational inclinations to\nsh\u00ec-f\u0113i. We should, however, adopt an attitude of\nepistemic modesty in making our perspective based choices and\nrecommending our interpretations to others.  That modesty arises from\nm\u00edngdiscerning that their perspectives,\nlike ours, arise from within a immensely complex and complicated\nnatural d\u00e0o structure. Epistemic modesty also\nundergirds Zhuangzi\u2019s openness and willingness to interact with\nothers.  If nature has a point of view, it is that one in which all\nactual d\u00e0os of sh\u00ec-f\u0113i-ing in\nnature are available as natural guiding structures. Hence nature makes\nno choice that implies a more absolute, or superior normative status\non either perspective. Nature makes them possible candidate guiding\nd\u00e0os for us to choose and walk. \n\nA question implicitly and repeatedly left to the reader is what\nZhuangzi means by \u660e\nm\u00edngdiscerning. Does it amount to taking\nthe view of nature but of nowhere in particular or\nis it a naturally occurring, perspective on perspectives, a\nrecognition of the plurality of natural perspectives? He usually\nrecommends to our attention insights gained from realizing that our\nchoice is one among a wide range of naturally available\nd\u00e0os. He provokes us to realize that we may make\nprogress and improve our guiding perspective by simulating the guiding\nperspectives of others. Some tales, by contrast, warn us not to expect\nthe d\u00e0os of others to mesh with our capacities and\ncharacter\u2014as with the boy from Shouling who goes to learn the\n Handan way of walking, which \u201ccripples\u201d\nhis original ability. Still a third outcome of the interaction, as\nwith violent gangsters, reminds us simply to keep our distance. \n\nHowever, in the standard cases, we learn from simulating others\u2019\nperspectives, choices and interpretations of the natural\nd\u00e0o-structures either from projecting or\ncommunicating\u2014sharing methods and techniques we did not grasp\nbefore (new ways to use gourds or hand-salve or find ways to\naccommodate and interact while \u201cwalking two ways\u201d).  New\naccumulated insights about natural structures may improve our range of\noptions, from our own point of view. Learning can also help us see how\nto walk in the natural paths together without getting in the other\u2019s\nway.\n\nIn understanding other\u2019s trajectories along their\nd\u00e0os, we may judge them as correct or\nincorrect. First, we do this from our own present perspective. We\nneither judge all to be right nor all to be wrong\u2014nor even that all\nare equal. Certainly, not all are equally worthy of our\nchoice. We need not judge that all are good choices for those\nfollowing them\u2014only that the grounds of their choice may be\ndifferent from ours. They might still be dogmatic, careless, or\nunwarranted even given the situational grounds of their\nchoice. Nothing about the naturalness of such choices arising\nmakes them right. All this is compatible with recognizing others as\nnatural creatures guided by natural inner processes along natural\nguiding d\u00e0os.\n We neither seek to follow all at once or each equally\u2014as Hui\nShi seems to suggest. Nor do we resolve to follow none\u2014as Shen\nDao suggests. We do judge that we might gain from being aware of and\nengaging in open exchanges\u2014as in Zhuangzi\u2019s dialogues.  We are more\ninclined to follow a path, and given our similarities, think we might\npursue it with benefit when we know some natural being like us found\nand followed it. And Zhuangzi clearly does ridicule the social\nmoralists (Confucians and Mohists) as well as Hui Shi for the\nnarrowness of their range of choices\u2014their failure to appreciate\nthe richness and complexity of alternative ways of life. \n\nOur tendency to appreciate and share others\u2019 values, to mirror their\nbehavior cooperatively, together with our awareness of the wide\nvariety of perspectives, many of which we judge to be worthless,\nmistaken, or dangerous, makes it hard to treat any projected\ntranscendental, comprehensive viewpoint as the single answer.\nZhuangzi\u2019s \u201cpivot of\nd\u00e0os,\u201d his \u201cview from nowhere,\u201d\nis not a final sh\u00ec-f\u0113i judgment.  It is the point\nprior to any sh\u00ec-f\u0113i and from which all\ndiverge. Each commitment propels us down a different path at a\nch\u00e9ngfixed momentum. We rely on\nch\u00e9ngfixed commitments to prior\nsh\u00ec-f\u0113i in all\nsh\u00ec-f\u0113i judgment. All\nsh\u00ec-f\u0113i are indexed within the\nnetwork. The judgment from no-where-when is no-judgment. \n\nWe learn from openness and exchange because we acquire commitments\nfrom simulating others\u2019 path following behavior. That we progress in\nsuch exchanges is something we ourselves judge, not the cosmos. No\njudgment comes from some point outside of or everywhere in the network\nof d\u00e0os. We are naturally influenced by others\u2019\nevaluations, their judgments of our choices and their behavioral\nvirtuosity\u2014especially when the others are our parents, perceived\nsuperiors and respected models. These, again, are the \u56e0\ny\u012bndependencies on which present judgments\ndepend.\n\nThis gives Zhuangzi\u2019s indexical relativism a different contour\nfrom Hui Shi\u2019s. The latter structures his analysis mainly on\ncomparatives. This leads him to a version of normative \u2018error\ntheory\u2019 \u2013the conclusion that we should abandon normative\nsemantic distinctions as all wrong.  Since the \u8faf\nbi\u00e0ndistinctions on which they are based\nare relative, they are unreal. Ergo, there are no real distinctions\nand the world is actually one. Any distinction making judgment, any\nsh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that, unnaturally\ndivides what is naturally one. Hui Shih\u2019s Tenth Thesis is:\nFlood concern on all the 10,000 thing-kinds; The cosmos is\none \u9ad4 t\u00edunit. (HY\n93/33/74)\nGraham, relying on his hypothesis that Zhuangzi frequently\nconsiders positions which he later rejects, had already targeted the\nstereotype view of Zhuangzi as agreeing with Hui Shi\u2019s\nmonism. Graham\u2019s translation reveals the reductio that puts\nmonism in a \u201cconsidered and rejected\u201d category. It amounts\nto the self-rebutting anti-language stance targeted by the Later\nMohists\u2014the error Zhuangzi\u2019s naturalism of all\nperspectives (the \u201cpipes of\nheaven\u201d) was intended to avoid.\n \u201c[H]eaven and earth were born together with me\nand the myriad things and I are one.\u201d\n\nNow that we are one, can I still say anything? Now that I have called\nus one, did I succeed in not saying something? One and the saying make\ntwo, two and one make three. Proceeding from here even an expert\ncalculator cannot get to the end of it, much less a plain\nman. (HY5/2/52\u201354)\n4.6 Zhuangzi on Language\nZhuangzi\u2019s relativism expresses choice, commitment, and\ninterpretive performance on analogy to natural processes involved in\nfollowing a path. Commitment is setting off along a path. We have\nmomentum and a trajectory. The shape of the path combines with these\nand commits us to walk on or continue in a way that depends\non the discernible shape of the path. Walking a path involves staying\nmostly within its physical boundaries. \nThis account allows us\nto capture the flavor of Zhuangzi\u2019s discussion which does not employ\nthe familiar Western sentence-based metaphors of laws, rules,\nprinciples with norms of obedience, belief or\npropositional desire.  Using the Western idiom, along with the\nassociated practical syllogism of belief-desire explanation would give\nZhuangzi the basis for a distinction between a cause and a\nreason\u2014a distinction he seems not to draw in his talk of\n\u56e0 y\u012bndependence. There is a kind of\ninference from d\u00e0os of choice, interpretation etc. of\na path and an internal feedback d\u00e0o (our \u5fb7\nd\u00e9 virtuosity at)\n\u201creading\u201d external paths to guide behavior. \nZhuangzi\nwould not make that point in terms of deduction from a normative\npremise or principle. The internal and external paths themselves have\na causal and normative relation to our walking behavior. A more\nsentential focus would similarly mean describing the outcome as an\naction rather than an extended course of  walking/following\nbehavior. A sentence would state the action or the intent\u2014rather like\nthe conclusion of a practical syllogism rather than, as as fits in\nthis metaphorical space, as performing a role in a play or or part in\na symphony.\n\nZhuangzi\u2019s use of the path metaphor did extend to the\nunderstanding of language but, again, not with a focus on sententials. Rather\nthan constructing d\u00e0os in sentential form, Zhuangzi\nconstrues language in d\u00e0o form. The focus of ancient\nChinese theory was on names on the analogy of path markers: \u201cgo\npast the tree, turn right and then down to the water.\u201d Names\ntake on importance as sign-posts along physical structures. Confucian\nsocial versions emphasized the names of social roles and statuses more\nthan of natural kinds. Primitivist opposition to social\nd\u00e0os led them into the sweeping anti-naming postures\nthat Later Mohists showed to be self-condemning. \n\nGraham\u2019s interpretation of Zhuangzi\u2019s\n pipes of nature gave him a way to evade\nthis anti-language abyss. Human language is a natural sound. Hui\nShi\u2019s using relativist premises about names to derive an\nabsolutist monism which threatened to collapse to the primitivist\nanti-distinction, anti-naming quietism. Making everything one is\nequivalent to denying \u8faf\nbi\u00e0ndistinctions thereby denying any real\nbasis for the sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis way-not that\nstatuses implicit in all\n\u540d m\u00edngnames\u00a0 and\ny\u00e1nwords:language.\nZhuangzi\u2019s naturalism is\nanti-dogmatic, it neither denies nor asserts any particular set of\ndistinctions as authentic. Distinctions arise from indexed here-now\npoints in the actual network of d\u00e0o\nperspectives\u2014by travelers on a trajectory along one of the\nd\u00e0os choosing\n\u662f\u975e sh\u00ec-f\u0113i this-not that\nfrom among multiple possible courses of behavior afforded by the\ncosmos. The cosmos does not select which way to make the choice. \n\nZhuangzi\u2019s analogy of language and wind, however, had its own\nproblems. Graham had noted that Zhuangzi returns to the metaphor\nnearer the middle of the dialogue, noting that here Zhuangzi seems to\nbe taking back some of its implications. Having disposed of\nMencius\u2019s appeal to intuition and Hui Shi\u2019s attempt to\nmake everything normatively equal, he here addresses a more\nchallenging position. The Later Mohists advocated a version of\npragmatic-semantic realism. The Later Mohists had also argued that\nwhen a \u8faf bi\u00e0ndistinction was\nformulated as a sh\u00ec-f\u0113i, e.g., one of the\ndisputants calls it \u201cox\u201d and the other\n\u201cnot-ox\u201d, one of them must \u52dd\nsh\u00e8ngwin i.e., \u7576\nd\u0101nghit on it. \n\nThe Later Mohists\u2019 version of common-sense realism incorporated social\nconventions. Conventions set out what\n\u7269 w\u00f9natural-kind each term\n\u201cselects out\u201d or\nbi\u00e0ndistinguishes from the rest. We then\nextend that distinction to pick out new objects based on their\nobjective similarity or difference (those accessible to \u201ceyes\nand ears\u201d of ordinary people). This is the basis of a social\nstandard of correct word use enshrined in past practice.\nHui Shi,\nhowever, had undermined that simple version of realism with his observation that\nbetween any two \u7269 w\u00f9natural-kinds we\ncan find some similarity and some difference. The\nworld, in effect, gives us many ways of establishing conventional\ndistinctions and assigning names. The Later Mohists had failed to find\nan adequate account of what similarities would and would not lead to\nwhat they called \u72c2\u8209 ku\u0101ngj\u01d4wild\npicking out . Zhuangzi\u2019s analogy of language to the noises\nmade by wind had seemed to echo Hui Shi\u2019s normlessness about\nlanguage. In this later passage, however, he revisits the wind\nanalogy, and retreats, accepting the Mohist insight that language is\nmore than a \u201cnatural sound.\u201d\n\n\n  Language is not blowing; those who use\nlanguage, have language. (Graham translates: \u201cSaying is\nnot blowing breath, saying says something.) That which it languages is\ndecidedly not yet fixed. Is the eventual result that they have (there\nis) language? Or there has never been language? Deeming it as\ndifferent from bird calls: does that mark a distinction?\u00a0 Or is\nthere no distinction?\u201d (HY4/2/23\u20134) (This passage is followed by\nthe passage cited in the \u201cIntuition\u201d sub-section\n above)\n\n\nThis frustrating vagueness and signature indecision in the text\nleaves interpreters to philosophize about what Zhuangzi\u2019s\nimplicit answer (\u660e m\u00edngdiscern:clear) might\nbe. However, the analogy with bird calls is a fortuitous suggestion.\nWe arrange, adapt and modulate the elements of our language to fit our\nenvironment, abilities, and opportunities (e.g., mating). Would\nZhuangzi have guessed the same about birds?\nThe claim following that\nconcurs that the \u201caboutness\u201d of a language exists but\naboutness is not fixed. This can be explicated with the\n above discussion of the indexicals \u662f\nsh\u00ecthis:right and \u5f7c\nb\u01d0that. Zhuangzi carries the diectic\ncharacter over to his treatment of the ubiquitous\nsh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that that undergird\nthe norms guiding how to use names (words). We endorse and recommend\n(sh\u00ec this:right) our guiding terms,\nlanguage and linked behavior. We may base that on our correctly\nfollowing prior commitments to d\u00e0os of word\nuse\u2014relying on a Confucian traditional standard, the past and\nexisting practices of our linguistic community.\n In one passage, Zhuangzi allows this appeal to past or existing\ncommon practice but does not endorse it as right\u2014merely as\nuseful. Conventions are useful because they facilitate\ncommunication. He he adds a tone of \u201cthat is all\u201d hinting\nwe need not regard them as plausible candidates for being absolutely\nright\u2014a single transcendent standard of use. \nOnly those who \u201cbreak through\u201d know how to\ncommunicate with it as a \u201cone.\u201d Because of this, we\ndon\u2019t use that strategy and instead locate things in the\nconventional realm. The\nconventional is useful; the useful, communicable, and the communicable\nachievable. If you hit on the achievable, you are almost there and\ndependent sh\u00ecs end. (Ibid.,  HY 4/2/36\u201337)\n \nZhuangzi describes our past sh\u00ecs of this kind as\n\u201clike an oath or treaty.\u201d (Ibid., HY 3/2/11) They\nhave \u201cenactment force\u201d committing us to a\nd\u00e0o governing their later use. We may conform to\n(correctly follow) and further construct our transmitted linguistic\nd\u00e0o in expressing or performing (\u70ba\nw\u00e9ideeming) other things as\nsh\u00ec-f\u0113i. Our trajectory along our paths\nincorporates these accumulated commitments to prior practices of\nlanguage use. As our d\u00e0os now bring us to new\nsituations, how do we know to project the correct indexed choice from\nthe prior history of differently-indexed behavior? That actual language behavior commits us to a linguistic d\u00e0o-type, but it\u2019s not clear what the commitment entails at this choice point.  The\nMohists and Confucians are both claiming, from their different\ndirectional perspectives, to be following similar commitments to existing\nd\u00e0os of practice.\n\nMozi\u2019s recommending naturally or empirically available\nd\u00e0os for reforming shared linguistic practice was\nitself, Mozi thought, following existing natural practice. He even\nnoticed that our ongoing linguistic practice rejects treating\nsomething\u2019s merely being a shared past practice as automatically making\nit right.  Our existing evaluation practices remind us that shared and\nunquestioned past practices can be wrong. \n\nMozi appealed to what he would also have regarded as a purely natural\npractice. Practical efficiency (l\u00ec\nbenefit) is a standard accessible to all ordinary people\u2019s\n\u201ceyes and ears.\u201d Each time we apply some natural, empirically guided interpretation in practice, we participate in\nshaping evolving normative practices (both linguistic and behavioral\npractices). Each such decision commits us and others to a\nd\u00e0o of interpreting our social d\u00e0o. We\nunderstand our commitment to that d\u00e0o as a commitment\nto practice and transmit it correctly\u2014where the standard of\n\u2018correct\u2019 is itself either enshrined in a past practice or\nin natural utility. This is the basis for Zhuangzi\u2019s claim that\nsocial d\u00e0os, including linguistic\nd\u00e0os, are natural d\u00e0os\u2014and there\nare many of them. Further, as the Laozi would later famously\nobserve, d\u00e0os can be interpretively guided. They are\nchangeable d\u00e0os.\u00a0 \n Humans, in finding ways to walk and walking them, initiate the\nconstruction of social paths, naturally and perhaps unintentionally,\nby leaving prints in the natural world. Zhuangzi links the path\nmetaphor to a society\u2019s linguistic practice thus:\n That which we treat as \u53ef k\u011bassertible\nis \u53ef k\u011bassertible;\nthat which we treat as not assertible is not\nassertible. D\u00e0os are made by walking them; thing-kinds\nare made \u7136 r\u00e1nso so by\nbeing called \u2018so\u2019. (Ibid., HY 4/2/33)\n\nThis sense of the immense complexity and the fluid nature of\nnormative commitments to a d\u00e0opath underlie\nZhuangzi\u2019s skeptical\nthemes. \u660e M\u00edngclear:discerning seems\nlinked to the gestalt in which we accept ourselves as embedded, along\nwith others similarly situated, in nature\u2019s endlessly complex\nevolution of guiding structures. How do we know either that our past\npractice was correct or that we are correctly following them in this\nnew situation, here and now, based solely on our eyes and ears?\n4.7 Skepticism\nZhuangzi\u2019s stance toward Mohist formal realism (if we\ndisagree on a sh\u00ec-f\u0113i, one party must \u52dd\nsh\u00e8ngwin) becomes clearer now. The Mohists\ndid not specify any objective mechanism of \u201cwinning\u201d\nbeyond some vague suggestion of tipping a balance. However Zhuangzi\u2019s\npoint in response appears to track the warning function of a\nnorm of truth (even when justified by our best available judging\nstandards, we may still be wrong). Zhuangzi takes\nsh\u00e8ngwinning as a vague primitive in\narguing that we cannot finally settle skeptical doubts by appeal to\nwinning disputes. The main mechanism Zhuangzi discusses is appeal to a\njudge or authority. We appreciate that all judges will also use terms\nlike sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that indexed by\ntheir acquired commitment momentum. Their judgments, like ours,\nexpress their momentum along a d\u00e0o of using\nthese words here, now and projecting the usage to\nthat, there, then. \n Given that you and\nI have been brought to \u8faf\nbi\u00e0ndispute and you win me over and I\ndon\u2019t win you over, in such a case is your distinction\nsubstantively \u662f Sh\u00ecthis:right? Mine\nsubstantively \u975e f\u0113i? If I win you over and\nyou don\u2019t win me over; is mine substantively right? And yours?;\nsubstantively wrong? Are they partly right and partly wrong? Or\njointly right and jointly wrong? You and I cannot know between\nourselves, so another human inherently inherits our obscurity and\ndoubt. To whom can we go to correct us?  Employing someone who agrees\nwith you, given that they are like you, how can they correct the\nsituation? Employing someone who agrees with me, given that they are\nlike me, how can they correct it? Employ someone different from both\nme and you to correct it, given that they are different from us both,\nhow can they correct it? Employ someone who is like both of us to\ncorrect it, given that they are like us both, how can they correct it?\nSo you and I and others cannot know, and in these condition on what\nother can we rely? The changing sounds\u2019 mutual dependence is like their\nconjoint autonomy. Harmonize them with glances at nature and make them\ndependent on eventual consensus and with that exhaust the\nyears. (Ibid., HY 7/2/84\u201392) \n\nIt is not clear if the conclusion is supposed to be a solution to the\nskeptical problem posed or merely a way to cope constructively with\ncomplexity and uncertainty. The passage rules out any appeal to a\nspecial authority of any other point of view\u2014while giving equal\nauthority in the construction to all. Even where we all share some\n\u201cconventional wisdom\u201d it does not have special\nauthority\u2014say over other creatures. This, was  implicit in Mozi\u2019s rejection of socially agreed\nd\u00e0os. Zhuangzi\u2019s notorious toying with the perspectives of\nanimals expanded it (for naturalists).\n.\n Gap-tooth asked\nKingsley, \u201cDo you know that which all natural kinds agree in\nsh\u00ecendorse-ing?\u201d He answers\n\u201cHow would I know that?\u201d \u201cThen, do you know of\nwhat you don\u2019t know?\u201d \u201cAnd how could I know\nthat?\u201d \u201cSo, does no natural kind know\nanything?\u201d \u201cAnd how would I know that? Nonetheless,\nlet me try to put it in language. How would I know that what I call\n\u2018knowing\u2019 is not not-knowing? And what I call\n\u2018not-knowing\u2019, is knowing.\u201d\n\nAnd let me try a question on you. If people sleep in the damp, they\nget pains and paralysis; would eels? If in a tree, they tremble in\nfear; would monkeys? Of the three, does any know the correct place to\nlive? \u2026 From where I see it, the origins of goodness and\nmorality, painting things as \u2018this/right\u2019 or\n\u2018not-that/wrong\u2019 are, as boundaries, both confused and\ncomplicated; how could I know how to distinguish them?\n(Ibid., HY 6/2/64\u201370)\n\n\nThis passage reinforces the conclusion that norms of correct word use\nis Zhuangzi\u2019s core skeptical target. So we may indeed know how\nto act, according to some norms of using \u2018know how\u2019 and\nnot if judged by some other d\u00e0o of correct usage of\nthe knowing/ignorant distinction. Linguistic skepticism easily\nmetastasizes to virtually any commitment. According to which\nd\u00e0o of projecting past practice should we\njudge this linguistic behavior as conforming to our commitment or\nnot. Normative skepticism, in a use-theory is hard to\ncontain\u2014especially when the model of all judgments is as some indexed\n\u662f \u975e sh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that\nassignment. It sweeps in metaphysics, epistemics, and semantics.\n\nA consequence is that Zhuangzi\u2019s skepticism is broad but weak. Broad\nbecause it infects so many judgments, but weak not merely in the usual\nsense of denying absolute certainty, but in failing to imply that we\nshould stop or refuse to make the judgment. It does not rest on any\ntheory of the probability of an error, but that the concept of an\nerror is subject to the same concerns as the original judgment. It\nneither undermines nor give us reason to withdraw our\njudgments. Appreciating that others reach their views as naturally as\nwe do only removes our status to claim that our judgment is\nauthentically and uniquely correct. \nTemporally, Zhuangzi\u2019s\nskepticism is buttressed by reminding us of our own past experiences\nof learning, of acquiring new gestalts, of realizing that what we had\nconsidered the way, was subject to reconsideration and\nimprovement. The skepticism does not target any specific failure in my\nepistemic process. It does not advise me to abandon my present\ncourse. It reminds me only to remain open to the further possibility\nof learning more\u2014about what? About the world? We can do that by\nlearning more about other natural ways of processing and how they work\nin the world\u2014other d\u00e0os.  It counts as\nskepticism because it reminds us that we normally err on the side of\noverestimating than underestimating our epistemic security. We think\nwe know and do not more often than we think we don\u2019t know and we\ndo. And that is because we underestimate the range of possible\nalternative d\u00e0os. Hence the pragmatic upshot of his\nskepticism is to remind us to engage with more other points of\nview.\n\nZhuangzi\u2019s skepticism is weak because it acknowledges that we\nmay apply different concepts of \u2018knowing\u2019 in different\nsituations. Implicitly, it does not deny that we could meet\nsome particular standard of knowing, but that we could know\nfor every situation which standard is the right one. What standard is\nthe right one to use for acknowledging or denying someone knows well\nenough to satisfy, for example, the correct d\u00e0o of\nassertion? \n\nThis feature of Zhuangzi\u2019s skepticism lies at the heart of the famous\ndebate between Zhuangzi and Hui Shi about the fish-pleasure in which\nZhuangzi defends a claim to know against Hui Shi\u2019s\nchallenge. Zhuangzi makes an assertion and Hui Shi initiates the\nskeptical challenge. His challenge implies that there is a favored or\ncorrect standard of knowing that turns out to be impossibly\nstrict. All knowledge must come from inside. It\u2019s impossibly strict\nbecause it doesn\u2019t allow Hui Shi to issue the challenge in this\nconversation. \n\n  Zhuangzi and\nHui Shi wandered over the Hao River bridge. Zhuangzi said,\n\u201cthose mini-fish coming from there and cruising around, relaxed\nand unhurried, are fish at leisure.\u201d Hui Shi said \u201cYou are\nnot a fish; from whence do you know the leisure of fish?\u201d Zhuangzi\nretorted, \u201cYou are not me, from what perspective do you know my\nnot knowing fish at leisure?\u201d Hui Shi responds, \u201cI\u2019m\nnot you, of course I don\u2019t know about you; You are not a fish\nand that\u2019s enough to count as you\u2019re not knowing\nfish\u2019s leisure.\u201d Zhuangzi concludes, \u201cLet\u2019s\nreturn to where we started. When you said \u2018from what perspective\ndo you know fish at leisure\u2019, you clearly knew my knowing it as you\nasked me. I knew it here above the Hao.\u201d  (Ibid., HY\n\u00a045/17/87\u201391)\n \nGraham drew our attention to the role of perspective in this\npassage, noting that Hui Shi\u2019s challenge to Zhuangzi\u2019s assertion\ndoes not use the normal question form, (\u4f55\nh\u00e9how do you know?) but a locative question word\n(\u5b89 \u0101nwhence?). This brings the debate into\nalignment with Zhuangzi\u2019s concern about the various perspectives\nfrom which to deploy a d\u00e0o of word use. Here, as\n above, the word is \u77e5\nzh\u012bknow. The norm of asserting, as in\nEnglish, involves answering the challenge \u201chow do you\nknow?\u201d What normative conditions allow me, here and now,\ncorrectly to use the term zh\u012bknow\u2014hence\nto make the assertion about these fish below me? Hui Shi both knew\nZhuangzi was relying on a d\u00e0o of using\n\u2018know\u2019 \u201cfrom zhuangzi\u2018s here\u201d and\nHui Shi knew Zhuangzi\u2019s situation from his own relevantly\nsimilar \u201chere-now\u201d and relying on the same \u9053\nd\u00e0onorm of claiming to know from a distinct\nperspective. Hui Shi cannot consistently insist that a speaker can\nonly use \u77e5 zh\u012bknow when he\noccupies the perspective of the thing known.\n4.8 Perspectives on Perspectives\nNotice, the argument about the fish implies we have a perspective\non the perspectives of others. So skepticism grounded in dependence or\nrelativity of perspective need not be predominantly\nnegative. Zhuangzi, here, uses it to justify a way of claiming to\nknowing. In many other parables, he addresses the kind of knowing that\ncomes with a gestalt shift, especially when we see our own and\nothers\u2019 points of view as similar\u2014see ourselves as others\nsee us. This is the more comprehensive perspective Zhuangzi urges on\nus. We experience such gestalt shifts especially when we come\nappreciate we had been wrong before and now view things\ndifferently. We are confident from our own \u201cnow\u201d that we\nhave made epistemic progress\u2014our new awareness seems\n\u201crelatively\u201d improved to us now. We reach a state where we\njudge our former perspective to be inferior to our present one. It\nincludes insight into our relative situations. Evidently, this\nawareness of one\u2019s own perspective as one of many, equally\nnatural points of view motivates us to wonder if we have made the\nfinal correction. This enhanced awareness of ourselves as one of many\nperspectives is an intelligible candidate reading of Zhuangzi\u2019s\n\u660e m\u00edngclarity. It is harder to\nconstruct a coherent narrative for mystical and/or dogmatic\nreadings\u2014those that jump from an improved perspective to a\nperfect one.\n This kind of gestalt shift leads us to reflect on how narrow our\npast perspective had been. It features prominently in the \u201cAutumn\nFloods\u201d Chapter 17. The Earl of the Yellow River, having thought\nhimself as the ultimate, discovers the North Sea and announces his\nformer error and newfound awareness of his lesser significance in\n\u201cthe greater path.\u201d The North Sea Overlord tells him that\nhe too sees himself as situated in a modest status in a still greater\nscheme and rejects the River Earl\u2019s attempts to identify the\nNorth Sea\u2019s as ultimate. He casts doubt on there being a final,\nultimately small or large.\n The lord of He river said, \u201cSo can I consider\ncosmos \u2018large\u2019 and the tip of a hair as\n\u2018small\u2019?\u201d North Sea Ruo replied, \u201cNo! Thing\nkinds have unlimited measurement (ways of measuring); Time has no end;\ndistinctions have no constancy, beginning and ending no inherent\ncause. Because of this great knowing is viewed within a range of\ndistant and close. \u2026We calculate that what humans know is never\nas great as what they do not know, their temporal extent of life is\nnot as great as not as much as the time before life, and from the very\nsmall to try to take in the scope of the very large, is an invitation\nto confusion and disorder and not that from which we can\ngain. (Ibid., HY 42/17/14\u201320) \n\nCan we describe Zhuangzi\u2019s m\u00edng as \u201chaving\na sense of our limited perspective?\u201d Credulous, dogmatic and\nimperious absolutists do not appreciate themselves as being in one of\na variety of natural perspectives. Broad open-mindedness and mild\nskepticism come together in the m\u00edngclarity\nZhuangzi encourages in us. It has a dual nature\u2014an epistemically\nmodest perspective on ourselves that arises from improving our\nepistemic status and encourages us to continue. It helps us appreciate\nthat we are still as naturally situated and others with whom we may\ndisagree and still grow. Further improvement can come from further\nexchange of perspectives. \n\nThe na\u00efve Confucian-Mohist advocates of imposing a single social\nd\u00e0o thus disrupt the natural process by which social\nd\u00e0os evolve in real time as we seek a harmony guided\nby \u201cglances at nature.\u201d Seeing things from another\u2019s\nperspective both alerts us to how we could be wrong and makes us feel\nthat we now understand things better than with our former, narrower\nperspective. Yet, the Zhuangzi repeatedly reminds us not to\nabandon epistemic modesty when we make epistemic progress. That we now\nsee things from a perspective in common with another does not make us\nboth right. Yet, the more comprehensive our perspective, the\n\u201cclearer\u201d the new gestalt should seem. \n The search for this kind of perspective on ourselves and others\nseems to motivate Zhuangzi\u2019s willingness to engage and interact\nwith others, seeking to understand their perspective as having a\nnatural status and role for them as ours does for us. This is partly\nillustrated by common sense examples of our judging from our own\ncurrent perspective that theirs \u201cadds something\u201d enriching\nour own perspective by our own lights. Sometimes it\u2019s dangerous\nto try to mix others\u2019 perspectives with your own. \nAnd have you alone not\nheard tell of those from Shou-ling who studied walking with those in\nHandan? They never mastered the country\u2019s skill and lost their\noriginal way of walking, and stumbled and crawled\nback. (Ibid., HY45/17/79\u201380) \n Aside from its frequent usefulness from our point of view, the\nmain benefit from the self-recognition as a natural creature embedded\nas are others at a perspective-point within a natural network\nstructure is to encourage being open-minded.  Part of the value is the\nhumbling of our epistemic pride, mildly disrupting our judgment\nequilibrium. Without such an occasional perspective on ourselves, we\ntoo easily fall into exaggerating our epistemic exceptionalism. The\nreminder that we are intermingled with others in a web of natural\nperspectives gives us an appropriate, realistic correction.  A\nZhuangzi story illustrates such a moment.\n\nZhuangzi was wandering in Diaoling fields when he glimpsed a\n  weird magpie-like-thing flying in from the south. It had a wingspan of\n  over seven-feet and passed so close his forehead, he could feel\n  it. Then it gathered its wings and settled in a chestnut\n  grove. Zhuangzi thought \u201cwhat bird is that?\u00a0 Massive\n  wings of such power and eyes so large it couldn\u2019t see\n  me.\u201d He hiked up his robe and hurriedly tiptoed closer holding his\n  cross-bow at the ready. Then he spotted a cicada settling in the\n  shaded shelter without a worry for itself, but a preying mantis\n  opened its pincers about to grab it, also focused on its gain and\n  ignoring its own bodily danger. The strange magpie burst out and\n  harvested them both\u2014similarly unaware of the natural dangers he\n  faced.\n\nBut Zhuangzi was suddenly seized with this thought, \u201cWe natural\nkinds are all interconnected! We two different species are mutually\nseeing things in our own ways.\u201d He dismantled his crossbow and\nfled, himself now himself pursued by the game warden shouting out his\ncrimes. (Ibid., HY 54/20/61\u20135)\n\nOverall, Zhuangzi clearly recommends open-minded flexibility as\nwhen he scolds Hui Shi for being tied to conventional thinking about\nhow to use giant gourds. He illustrates it again with his story about\ndifferent uses of a salve that prevents chapping. He models such\nopenness in his conversations with cripples (righteously shunned by\nConfucians), freaks, thieves, strange creatures, the wind, a shadow\nand a skull. He imagines many other conversations illustrating the\ndifferences of perspectives, capacities and needs. \n\nWhile we cannot help making our own judgments and commitments, he\nseems to see tolerance and accommodation as values that follow from\nappreciating other natural perspectives:\n A monkey keeper says (to the monkeys) \u201cI\u2019ll\ngive you three [rations] in the morning and four in the\nevening.\u201d The monkeys seemed angry. \u201cOk, I\u2019ll give\nyou four in the morning and three in the evening.\u201d The monkeys\nwere happy.  So with no substantive loss, he could change their anger\nto happiness. This is an example of a sh\u00ec judgment\nbeing dependent on circumstances. So the sage uses\nsh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that judgments to\nharmonize and rests in the natural balance. And we can call this\nwalking as pairs. (Ibid., HY 5/2/38\u201340) \n We are, as it happens, capable of understanding the perspectives\nof others well enough to accommodate and cooperate with them, to\nborrow insights and to reach agreements. However, the\nZhuangzi seems skeptical that we can extrapolate from this\nordinary capacity to broaden our perspective to having some absolute\nor comprehensive insight\u2014as it were from all points of\nview. Nor, as we saw above, can we assume that because the two\ndisputants come to a resolution or agreement, it constitutes knowing\nfrom a cosmically or absolutely higher perspective.  Hui Shi\u2019s\nrelativism, recall, does point to such an infinite expansion ending in\na single universal point of view. Here, however, we are reminded that\nwhile we experience a gestalt broadening of perspective as revealing\nsomething real and significant (like waking from a dream), we cannot\nextrapolate from that to the claim to be able to know the final result\nof such gestalt leaps to broader perspectives.\n\nEven though North Sea Lord denies there is any final or ultimately\nbroad perspective from which we can make\nsh\u00ec-f\u0113ithis-not that judgments, the\nparable suggests a progressive path toward broader perspectives with\nthose further along having the epistemic status to guide those with\nless comprehensive perspectives. However, arguments in Chapter 2\nsuggest that progress must always be judged from a moving frame of\nreference along a d\u00e0o that is already\nch\u00e9ngfixed in our\nx\u012bnheart-mind that shoots-out the\nsh\u00ec-f\u0113i.\nOur location and trajectory makes us\nreceptive to some and not other avenues of learning. The boy was\nunable to master the Handan way of walking\nbecause of the way he had already learned to walk. The monkey keeper\ncould accommodate the monkeys, but still disagreed with them about the\nimportance of the breakfast-dinner choice. That someone understands\nand agrees with both of us does not make his judgment correct. The\nfinal skepticism concerns whether these paths of progress of\nperspectives must or will converge on a single outcome. \n\nThe epistemic modesty implicit in Zhuangzi\u2019s skepticism targets\nmainly the paternalistic, superior attitude toward other points of\nview exemplified by Confucian and Mohist moralistic posture. When we\nhave an accommodation (you and I come to a common agreement) you and I\nmay both rate it as progress. However, it does not imply we have moved\nto a higher state of overall insight along an absolute scale\u2014or from\nany arbitrary third point of view. Exchange of points of view can be\nvaluable to each (perhaps in different ways) and broadening\nperspective in this way can make us wiser\u2014but always as judged\nfrom our already operative \u6210\nch\u00e9ngfixed d\u00e0os . We can\nadvise and recommend our normative perspective on others, but their\nbeing able to appreciate and use it depends on their capacities,\noptions and situation. \n\nAt this point, Zhuangzi starts to draw an analogy of dreaming and\nwaking up to the shift in gestalt that comes when we leap to a more\ncomprehensive perspective. At awakening, we immediately appreciate the\nunreality of the dream, yet within the dream, we can have a similar\ngestalt shift and dream of having dreamed and interpreted that deeper\ndream. \nHow do I know that loving life is not a form of ignorance?\nHow do I know disliking death is not a weak farewell of the sort when\nwe don\u2019t know about the return? Miss Li Zhi cries when she is\nbetrothed to someone\u2019s son, and when she first goes off to the Jin\nstate soaks her clothing with her tears; but then she arrives at the\nkings abode, sleeps with the king in his bed, eats  fattened\nlivestock and then starts to regret her tears. How do I know the dead\ndo not regret their former clinging to life, We dream of eating and\ndrinking and on awaking cry bitterly, we dream of weeping and wailing\nand awake in a good mood to go off hunting. When we dream, we don\u2019t\nknow it as a dream, and in our dreams, judge something else as a\ndream. On awakening, we know it was a dream, and there could be\nanother greater awakening in which we know a greater dream, and under\nthese the conditions the ignorant think they are as enlightened as if\nthey had learned it by an investigation. Gentlemen to shepherds\ninherently do this! (Ibid., HY 6/2/78\u201383) \nSo, is there an ultimate or final possible such shift in\ngestalt\u2014some final state of knowing what to do? Zhuangzi\u2019s\nrelativism is mildly skeptical because he cannot know either that\nthere is not nor that there is a final or ultimate\n\u201cawakening\u201d\n\nThe dream theme is memorably carried over to the story of Zhuangzi\ndreaming a butterfly and/or vice versa. It seems to suggest that the\ngestalt sense of liberation from error may even be reciprocal. Perhaps\nour subsequent perspective is one from which most would move to our\nformer perspective. Adolescent conversion can be to or from a\nreligion. \n Once before, Zhuangzi dreamt of being a butterfly, gaily\nbutterflying and himself embodied in this sense of purpose! He knew\nnothing of Zhuangzi.  Suddenly awakening, he then is rooted in\nZhuangzi. He doesn\u2019t know if Zhuangzi dreamt being a butterfly\nor a butterfly is dreaming being Zhuangzi\u2014though there must be a\ndifference. This is called \u201cthings change.\u201d (Ibid.,\nHY7/2/94) \n Elaborating the complexity this way makes Zhuangzi\u2019s\nproposals seem disappointing as solutions. They amount to mildly\nsuggesting that we allow the exchange of views to go on without the\ndomination of any dogma and with some vague \u201cglances at natural\nconstancies\u201d and see what comes out \u201cin the long\nrun.\u201d\n\nZhuangzi\u2019s conception of d\u00e0os in nature, from a\nhere-now to a there-then, differs from a Mohist (broadly utilitarian)\nnaturalism. Utilitarianism is a natural constraint, an allegedly\nsingle naturally correct way for all of us to choose our course. In\neffect, Zhuangzi is more of a natural pluralist, with the natural\noutcome of morality the product of ongoing individual and social\nconstruction.\nD\u00e0os are in nature but not choices of\nnature for us. So the discussion, competition, and even strife between\nd\u00e0os and their advocates are factors in an ongoing\nnatural \u9053 d\u00e0oguiding process. We and\nour circumstances change as we each find, choose and walk different\nnaturally evolving paths.\n\nThis does not entail we should not advocate our own way. Such\nexchanges are part of the natural process of construction of \u9053\nd\u00e0ospaths and making them available to\nothers. Such a dialogue of competing d\u00e0os constitutes\nthe natural evolutional d\u00e0o of guidance. Realizing\nthis, we should not flatter ourselves, posing as the Confucian father\nshaping his child\u2019s character, but as a contributor in this\ncompetition among similarly natural ways. We express perspectives\nlocated in a real world of indexed points from which we choose\nbehavioral paths.\nSome characters in Zhuangzi\u2019s dialogues wonder\nabout exceptional figures who allegedly have abilities that justify\nthat paternal posture\u2014the capacity to transcend our location in\npoints of view and to lecture all of us from a privileged\nperspective. The Zhuangzi\u2019s response typically remind\nthem that such idealized points of view are neither intelligible to us\nnor relevant to what we should do. Either these exceptional\nobservers have their own naturally\nch\u00e9ngfixed frames of reference in the\nnatural world, or they are outside of the natural world in some\nunrealistically free realm. If the latter, then their views are both\nunintelligible and irrelevant to us. What they would do in our\nsituation does not constitute helpful advice to us. To advocate\nfollowing the advice of these ideal observers is to speak practical\nnonsense to non-ideal, actual actors.\n\nGap Tooth, following Kingsley\u2019s skeptical formulation\n above says:\n\nSo you don\u2019t know what is beneficial or harmful, does the\n\u201cfully arrived human\u201d necessarily not know them?\u00a0\nKingsley replied, \u201cthe fully arrived person becomes pure\nsapience, he could be in a blazing forest and not be able to feel any\nheat, the rivers of our civilization could freeze and he\ncouldn\u2019t feel any chill, devastating lighting could pulverize\nmountains and the wind raise a tidal wave and he could not experience\nsurprise. Someone like that could ride on clouds and air, straddle the\nsun and moon, and wander beyond the four oceans.\u00a0 Death and life\nare not different for him, much less the inclinations of benefit and\nharm.\u201d\n\nMaster Ju Que asked master Zhang Wu, \u201cI\u2019ve heard from\nmy teacher that a sagely man does not find social dealings worth\nengaging, doesn\u2019t pursue utility, doesn\u2019t avoid harm,\ndoesn\u2019t take delight in striving, doesn\u2019t follow\nd\u00e0os, in silence says things, and in saying things is\nsilent, and roams outside the nitty-gritty of the actual world. Master\nregarded this as romantic fantasy but I deem it the execution of a\nmysterious d\u00e0o. My kind sir what do you say of\nthis?\u201d\n\nZhang Wu replied, \u201cThis is something that, were the yellow\nemperor to hear, it would be like buzzing, and so how could the likes\nof Confucius come to know it? Furthermore, you have jumped to\nconclusions\u2026 . I\u2019ll give you some absurd talk and you absurdly\nlisten.\u201d (Ibid., HY 6/2/71\u20137)\n\n However, in later chapters, Zhuangzi himself seems to recommend to\nus examples of such spectacular capacities\u2014the most beautifully\nand elaborately expressed of which is the passage celebrating Butcher\nDing.\nButcher Ding carved an ox for Lord Wen Hui; his point\nof contact, the way he inclined his torso, his foot position, the\nangle of his knee \u2026 gliding, flowing! The knife sang\n\u201cwhuaa\u201d with nothing out of tune. It was as if he were\ndancing the Faun Ballet or directing an opera. \nLord Wen Hui exclaimed \u201cOle! Splendidly done! Can talent\nextend even to this?.\n\nButcher Ding gestured with his knife, explaining, \n\n\u201cWhat your\nservant pursues is d\u00e0o; which is what skill aims\nat. When I began to carve oxen, what I saw was nothing but the\noxen. After three years, I had ceased seeing them as wholes, and now\nmy sapience mingles so that I don\u2019t see with my eyes, Sensory\nknow-how ends and my sapient desires take over my performance. I rely\non natural guiding structures, separate out the great chunks and steer\nthrough empty gaps depending on the anatomy. I evade places where\ncords and filaments intertwine, much less the large bones. \nA good cook gets a new knife every year; he chops! Mediocre cooks\nchange knives monthly; they hack. My knife now has 19 years on it;\nit\u2019s carved several thousand oxen and the edge is as if I had\njust taken it from the sharpener.\n\n  Those joints have gaps, and the knife\u2019s edge no thickness, to\nput something infinitesimally thin in an empty space?! Effortless! It\neven allows the edge wander in with ample room to play. That is why,\nwith 19 years on it, this knife\u2019s edge is grindstone\nfresh.\u201d\n(Ibid., 7/3/2\u20138)\n The Zhuangzi plays several variations on this theme.\nSometimes the virtuoso performer catches cicadas on a sticky rod,\nanother crafts chariot wheels, there are musicians, debaters, and\nthieves. The theme extends to animals, millipedes with their expertise\nin coordinating their limbs while maintaining a smooth flow, snakes\nflashing by while slithering on their stomachs, One implicit example\nis Zhuangzi\u2019s own relation with his relativist rival and buddy,\nHui Shi. Bemoaning his loss while visiting his sidekick\u2019s grave,\nZhuangzi spins a tale of a virtuoso ax-thrower who sliced specks off\nthe nose of his crony, but lost his \u201cknack\u201d when his\nco-performer passed away. (Ibid., HY 66/24/48\u201351)\n The tales often highlight the tranquil state that accompanies\nbehavior that skillfully follows a natural path. The performances look\nand feel effortless. The spontaneity of the flow along a natural path\ngives performers the sense that their behavior is\n\u201cworld-guided\u201d rather than internally controlled.  These\nbehaviors become second-nature. We move beyond anything like\nsub-vocalizing instructions, deliberating or reflecting\u2014and yet we\nare concentrating intently on the behavior. The range of his examples\nreminds us that such satisfying states of performance can be\nexperienced in even the most low caste and mundane of activities,\nincluding butchering, criminal skills, as well as in the finest of\narts, and philosophy. \n\nAnother feature of this theme is the observation that such expertise\nin performance always comes with some kind of limitation\u2014not\nleast that each example is a different person with a different\nknack. There is no shortcut d\u00e0o that gives you a knack\nat every activity. Cook Ding \u201ccomes to a hard place;\u201d the\ncicada catcher tries to balance two coins on his stick\u2014if he is\nnot calm enough, he will have a bad night. The wheelwright could not\nteach his son the art; the musician cannot play all the notes and only\nreaches true perfection when he dwells in silence. And above all, the\nvalorization of this kind of specialization in an art pulls in the\nopposite direction of Zhuangzi\u2019s encouragement to broaden and\nenlarge our perspectives and scope of appreciation. \n\nThis theme of the limits of virtuosity is pursued explicitly in the Zhuangzi\u2019s\ndiscussion of the necessary connection of\n\u6210 ch\u00e9ngcompletion:success and\n\u8667 ku\u012b failure:deficiency. The theme of\nthis weak skeptical relativism plays out smoothly into the classical\nChinese focus on paths as the model of normativity and the objects of\nknowledge. Paths are everywhere, but guide natural kinds from particular space-time\nlocations and can guide a wide range of behavior types, normative\nsubject matters. Each leads to subsequent choices among\nd\u00e0ospaths.\nZhuangzi does not ground his\nskepticism in an account of specifically human epistemic\ndeficiencies. We are one among many natural creatures with different\ncapacities choosing paths from their indexed point in space and time.\nThe skeptical theme is the wide range of our different\nperspectives. We are limited mainly in the sense that there is no\nbehavior from the point of view of the whole\u2014there is no omniscient\nperspective on the path structure. We may wonder if we have discovered\nall the available \u9053 d\u00e0ospaths. And\nwe may always wonder if our judgment about which is best now is about\nthe best in the long run. All we can substitute for this global\nperspective is some local consensus.\nSubstantively, in the end, is there success and defect?\nSubstantively, in the end, is there neither success nor defect?....If\nwe can call these successful, then even I am also successful. If they\ncannot be called successful, then neither I nor any other thing may be\ncalled successful. For this reason, illumination of slippery doubt is\nthat which sages target. For this reason, we do not use it and let\nthings rest in the conventional. (Ibid., HY\n5/2/42\u201347)\n\nThe weak skeptical conclusion is most strikingly expressed in the\nobservation that introduces the chapter with the story of Cook\nDing. \n My life is limited and know-how is unlimited. To pursue\nthe unlimited with the limited is dangerous. (Ibid., HY\n7/3/1)",
