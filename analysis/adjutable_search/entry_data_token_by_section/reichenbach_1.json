    "main_text": "Causality and Probability || Doctoral Thesis\n2.1 Doctoral Thesis\n\nReichenbach\u2019s doctoral thesis, The Concept of Probability in\nthe Mathematical Representation of Reality (1915b), contains many\nof the themes that concerned him throughout his life, and anticipated\nin some detail 21st century philosophical discussions of\nprobability relations between microscopic and macroscopic systems.\nIndeed, the development of his ideas about causality and probability\nfrom 1915 until the end of his life can be seen as a series of\nreexaminations and reformulations of issues the thesis implicitly\nposed and the solutions it explicitly offered. \n\nThe thesis develops an account of probability appropriate for\nscientific inference. It presents an argument to supplement what\nReichenbach understands to be Kant\u2019s transcendental principle of\ncausality with a transcendental principle of probability. In\nReichenbach\u2019s reading of Kant, the \u201cprinciple of\ncausality\u201d asserts that every event is preceded by a cause that\ndetermines it according to some universal law (see the discussion of\nKant\u2019s principle in Section 2 of the entry on\n Kant and Hume on Causality).\n The principle is \u201ctranscendental\u201d because it cannot be\nempirically established, but is instead a precondition for the very\npossibility of empirical knowledge. Reichenbach\u2019s claim is that\nthere is a principle of probability that has an equal status: it\ncannot be empirically established, but it is a precondition of\nempirical knowledge. It states that events are governed by a\nprobability distribution.\n\nReichenbach considers, and rejects, the subjective interpretation of\nprobability advocated by the then prominent philosopher and\npsychologist Carl Stumpf (1892a, b), and, less emphatically, the\nattempt at an objective interpretation advocated by Johannes von Kries\n(1886), a physiologist who had studied with Hermann von Helmholtz.\nAccording to Reichenbach, von Kries\u2019s account of probability\nneeds to be freed from the principle of insufficient reason\u2014that\nmutually exclusive events of which we have no knowledge that would\ndetermine differential probability are equally probable. As a\nsubjective principle, Reichenbach claimed, it had no place in science.\nReichenbach insists on an \u201cobjective\u201d interpretation of\nprobability\u2014in the Kantian sense as about the world of\nexperience\u2014for which probability statements are synthetic, but\nnot verifiable, claims about the empirical world. His task, as he sees\nit, is to demonstrate that probabilistic statements are supported by a\nclaim\u2014the \u201cexistence of a probability\nfunction\u201d\u2014which is a transcendental principle that is\nnecessary, and in combination with causal principles sufficient, for\nempirical knowledge. \n\nReichenbach\u2019s technical argument is an adaptation of Henri\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s results on probability functions and what have\nsince come to be called \u201cstrike ratios\u201d (Poincar\u00e9,\n1912, pp. 148\u2013150). By considering events collected in a\nhistogram, in which alternate equally narrow columns are black and\nwhite, Reichenbach argues that as the number of (independent) events\nincreases (and the width of the columns decreases) the ratio of black\nto white events within any interval of the abscissa will approximate\n1. Reichenbach\u2019s general idea is that if a variable X\nis divided into two or more classes of very small intervals of equal\nwidth (in X units) juxtaposed in a definite order and\nproportion, then there will be a probability for the occurrence of a\nvalue of X within any particular class that is invariant over\nall Riemann integrable probability distributions for X. (The\nRiemann integral of a function describing a curve is defined as the\nlimit of the sum of rectangles touching the curve as their width\napproaches 0.)\n\n\n\n\nReichenbach extends the analysis to error probabilities for physical\nmeasurements. He then argues that since all physical measurements are\nsubject to error, knowledge of natural laws is possible only if errors\noccur subject to a probability distribution, a proposition that is\nsynthetic but cannot be established empirically. Empirical knowledge\nthus requires both an a priori principle of causality for individual\nevents and an a priori principle of probability to ensure that\nindividual events can be aggregated into general laws. No explicit\ninterpretation of probability is forwarded, although Reichenbach\nimplies that probability claims are about frequencies of causally\nindependent events\u2014a notion for which probability theorists\nwould later substitute the idea of independent, identically\ndistributed events (see the entry on\n probabilistic causation)\u2014\n in observed and unobserved collections of cases. \n\nFurther Reading. The thesis with an introduction to the\narguments can be found in Reichenbach (2008). Re-statements and slight\nvariations of the arguments in the thesis can also be found in\nReichenbach (1920c), Reichenbach (1920e) and to a lesser extent in\nReichenbach (1930g) and chapter 9 of Reichenbach (1949f). A synopsis\nis also given in Padovani (2011), while Eberhardt (2011) provides a\ncritical assessment of the thesis.\n",
