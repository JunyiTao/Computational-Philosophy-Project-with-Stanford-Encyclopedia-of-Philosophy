    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\nAccording to ancient reports, Democritus was born about 460 BCE (thus,\nhe was a younger contemporary of Socrates) and was a citizen of\nAbdera, although some reports mention Miletus. As well as his\nassociate or teacher Leucippus, Democritus is said to have known\nAnaxagoras, and to have been forty years younger than the latter (DK\n68A1). A number of anecdotes concern his life, but their authenticity\nis uncertain.\n\nThe work of Democritus has survived only in secondhand reports,\nsometimes unreliable or conflicting: the reasoning behind the\npositions taken often needs to be reconstructed. Much of the best\nevidence is that reported by Aristotle, who regarded him as an\nimportant rival in natural philosophy. Aristotle wrote a monograph on\nDemocritus, of which only a few passages quoted in other sources have\nsurvived. Democritus seems to have taken over and systematized the\nviews of Leucippus, of whom little is known. Although it is possible\nto distinguish some contributions as those of Leucippus, the\noverwhelming majority of reports refer either to both figures, or to\nDemocritus alone; the developed atomist system is often regarded as\nessentially Democritus\u2019.\n\nDiogenes Laertius lists a large number of works by Democritus on many\nfields, including ethics, physics, mathematics, music and cosmology.\nTwo works, the Great World System and the Little World\nSystem (see the entry on\n doxography of ancient philosophy),\n are sometimes ascribed to Democritus, although Theophrastus reports\nthat the former is by Leucippus (DK 68A33). There is more uncertainty\nconcerning the authenticity of the reports of Democritus\u2019 ethical\nsayings. Two collections of sayings are recorded in the fifth-century\nanthology of Stobaeus, one ascribed to Democritus and another ascribed\nto an otherwise unknown philosopher \u2018Democrates\u2019. DK\naccepts both as relating to Democritus, but the authenticity of\nsayings in both collections is a matter of scholarly discussion, as is\nthe relationship between Democritus\u2019 atomism and his ethics.\n",
