Fitness as a Propensity and the Principle of Natural Selection\n\n\nThe Pence-Ramsey proposal holds out the prospect of dealing with a\nserious difficulty that long daunted the probabilistic propensity\ndefinition of fitness. For the counterexamples it deals with made\nimpossible any attempt to turn a generic probabilistic schema for\nfitness into a complete general definition that is both applicable and\nadequate to the task of vindicating the truth of the principle of\nnatural selection (PNS):\n\n\nPNS : If \\(x\\) is fitter than \\(y\\), then probably \\(x\\) will have\nmore descendants than \\(y\\).\n\n\nNote that if we cannot give anything more than a generic schema for\n\u2018\\(x\\) is fitter than \\(y\\)\u2019, then the PNS cannot be\nexpressed as a synthetic proposition with a truth-value and so cannot\nfigure as a general law. These problems had suggested to some\nphilosophers that we need to rethink the cognitive status of the\ntheory of natural selection altogether.\n \n\nBrandon, for example, has argued that the theory of natural selection\nshould not be viewed as a body of general laws, but as the\nprescription for a research program. As such its central claims need\nnot meet standards of testability, and fitness need not be defined in\nterms that assure the nontriviality, testability, and direct\nexplanatory power of the theory of natural selection. In that sense,\nBrandon makes common cause with the later Popper. Popper originally\nargued the claim that the theory of natural selection was\nunfalsifiable pseudoscience. Later he came to hold that theory of\nnatural selection was a scientifically respectable but nevertheless\nuntestable organizing principle for biological science (Brandon 1990,\n139\u2013140).\n\n\nOn this view, in each particular selective scenario a different\nspecification of the schematic propensity definition of fitness\nfigures in the antecedent of a different and highly restricted\nprinciple of natural selection that is applicable only in that\nscenario. Properly restricted to the right function and the right set\nof statistical features of its reproductive rate for a given\nenvironment, this version will be a highly specific claim about\nnatural selection for the given population in the given\nenvironment.\n\n\nThe notion that there is a very large family of principles of natural\nselection, each with a restricted range of application, will be\nattractive to those biologists uncomfortable with a single principle\nor law of natural selection, and to those philosophers of science who\ntreat the theory of natural selection as a class of models. On the\n\u201csemantic approach\u201d to the theory of natural selection,\neach of the substitution instances of the schematic principle of\nnatural selection generated by a particular specification of the\npropensity definition of fitness is treated as a definition of a\ndifferent Darwinian system of population change over time. See Lloyd\n1994, Beatty 1981, and Thompson 1989 for exposition of this\nposition. The evolutionary biologist\u2019s task is to identify which\ndefinition is instantiated by a population in an environment.\n \n\nFor every such definition instantiated by a population, there is the\nsynthetic truth that the members of the population, or all of its\nsubpopulations, instantiate the definition, and the further broader\ntruth that many populations of otherwise diverse species instantiate a\nsmall sub-set of the models, and the yet broader truth that all\npopulations instantiate one of this set of really quite similar\nmodels. Presumably, all these statements of varying degrees of\ngenerality need explanation. Consequently, those who resist the\n\u201csemantic interpretation\u201d of theories argue that we might\nas well treat each as a substitution instance of the principle of\nnatural selection generated by a different probabilistic propensity\nmeasure of fitness as a distinct empirical generalization to begin\nwith instead of a model-theoretic definition. But, one will want to\nask, does this set of generalizations with similar antecedents and\nidentical consequents have something in common, which in turn explains\nand unifies them, or are they the fundamental principles of the theory\nof natural selection? The question is obviously rhetorical. For each\nof the members of the set of functions that turn the definition-schema\nfor fitness into a complete property is a measurement of the fitness\nof some actual or potential individuals or populations. Each is a\nmeasurement appropriate to its particular environmental circumstances,\na measurement inappropriate for the same or different individuals at\ndifferent locations or times in the same environment.\n\n\nOne alternative is to allow that the PNS is a necessary truth but\ncontinue to hold that it has explanatory content, and can figure in\ncausal explanations of evolutionary outcomes. This is a view advanced\nby Sober (see Sober 2002) and examined in Lange and Rosenberg\n(2011). As we shall see in the next section, another possibility is to\nrelativize reproductive rates in favor of another universal measure of\nfitness.\n",
