    "main_text": "\n\nThe Andalusian philosopher, physician and judge Ibn Rushd\n(1126\u20131198) is one of the great figures of philosophy within the\nMuslim contexts, and a foundational source for post-classical European\nthought.\n\nThe hallmarks of Ibn Rushd\u2019s work are his convictions that\nphilosophy is capable of demonstrative certainty in many domains, that\nit is Aristotle who should be our preeminent guide in philosophy, and\nthat philosophy should play a central role within religious inquiry,\nrather than being an alternative to religion. But part of what gives\nhis ideas their enduring interest is the subtle way in which he\npromotes other methods of reasoning and persuasion in contexts where\nthe rigors of Aristotelian demonstration are not a practical option.\nTo grasp Ibn Rushd\u2019s thought in full requires attending not only\nto the Aristotelian commentaries where he attempts to develop\nphilosophy as a demonstrative science, but also to areas like\nreligion, medicine, and law, where constraints of both subject-matter\nand audience require other argumentative and rhetorical\ntechniques.\n\nOften improperly referred to as Averroes\u2014the corrupted form his\nname took in Latin\u2014Ibn Rushd quickly achieved such prominence in\nlater European thought as to rival the influence of Aristotle himself,\nwhose works Ibn Rushd tirelessly championed. Most modern scholarship\norients itself around his reception in Christian Europe, where he was\nknown simply as \u201cthe Commentator,\u201d and so fails to\nappreciate Ibn Rushd\u2019s own distinctive philosophical\nachievements.\n",
