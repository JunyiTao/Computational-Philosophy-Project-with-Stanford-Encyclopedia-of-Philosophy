They all have in common that they provide evidence that\nindividuals make some voluntary contributions to public\ngoods. What they investigate are the factors that affect the sizes of\nthe contributions and the mechanisms used to encourage people to\ncontribute.\n\nField studies have been used to examine the relationship\nbetween an individual\u2019s contributions to a public good and\nothers\u2019 contributions. Depending on what one thinks\nindividuals\u2019 primary motivations are, one would expect an\nindividual\u2019s and others\u2019 contributions to be substitutes\nor complements. If an individual is primarily motivated by altruism,\nhe or she will care about the consumption of others and therefore\ncontribute less when others or the government already contribute\nenough. In this case we would expect the two kinds of contributions to\nbe substitutes. If, by contrast, an individual is primarily motivated\nmy social norms such as fairness and reciprocity, he or she will\ncontribute when others do their bit. In that case, we would expect the\ntwo kinds of contributions to be complements. Whether they are on\naverage substitutes or complements is an issue that is difficult to\ndetermine in laboratory experiments due to the relatively small sample\nsizes and because the mix of motivations may differ between experiment\nand field.\n\nA field experiment involving an on-air fundraising campaign for a\npublic radio station found support for the complementarity hypothesis\n(Shang & Croson 2009). Specifically, if social information is\nprovided about a high contribution of another donor, pledges increase\nand the likelihood that a donor contributes again next year goes up.\nThe same has been found in a study of voluntary contributions to an\ninformation good (a newsletter) on the Internet (Borck et al. 2006).\nThere have also been field studies of alternative provision\nmechanisms, comparing a voluntary contribution mechanism for a pure\npublic environmental good to a green tariff mechanism, which can be\ninterpreted as an impure public good (Kotchen & Moore 2007).\n\nThe substitutes-vs-complements issue has also been investigated in\nobservational studies. That contributions are perfect\nsubstitutes, i.e., that government contributions or other private\ncontributions crowd out an individual\u2019s contribution completely\nis widely rejected. \u201cComplete crowding out\u201d here would\nmean that every dollar spent on a public good by the government\nreduces private spending by the same amount. Most studies find either\nno crowding out, or a merely a small amount. For example, Kingma 1989\nand Kingma & McClelland 1995, focusing on public radio, found only\na limited amount of crowding out between 12% and 19% of government\nexpenditures on public radio (i.e., one dollar spent by government\nreduces private contributions by 12\u201319 cents).\n\nThere are a number of historical case studies as well. Ronald\nCoase\u2019s study of the provision of lighthouses in nineteenth\ncentury Britain has already been mentioned. Cowen 1992 contains a\nnumber of further case studies that look closely at contracts between\nbee keepers and apple growers (exchanging the public good pollination)\nin Washington State, fire protection, leisure and recreation in the\nUnited States, species conservation in the Cayman Islands, and\neducation in Great Britain before large-scale state subsidies. In each\nof these cases, the authors point to private solutions to the public\ngoods problem. A historical review of publicly financed public goods\nis provided in Desai 2003.\n",
