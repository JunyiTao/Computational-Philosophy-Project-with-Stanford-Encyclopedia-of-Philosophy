    "main_text": "Metaphysical Supervenience and Ethical Realism\n4. Metaphysical Supervenience and Ethical Realism\n\nThe Blackburn-inspired argument against ethical realism relies\ncrucially on the assumption that ethical supervenience is a conceptual\ntruth. For thesis (2) was crucial to that argument:\n\n2. No specific naturalistic description of an action\nconceptually entails an ethical description\u2026.\n\n\nWhile many find (2) plausible, fewer would be prepared to accept a\npurely metaphysical version of this thesis, such as:\n\n2*. No base way a world could be metaphysically\nnecessitates that world being a certain ethical way.\n\n\nThis is precisely because thesis (2*) is inconsistent with the strong\nmetaphysical supervenience of the ethical, which very many\nphilosophers accept. This means that a purely metaphysical variant of\nBlackburn\u2019s argument will not be plausible.\n\nThis does not mean, however, that treating ethical supervenience as a\nnon-conceptual truth renders it dialectically inert. This section\nconsiders the significance of metaphysical supervenience for ethical\nrealism: does it pose a challenge to ethical realism? If so, how can\nwe best understand this challenge? And what resources do different\nsorts of ethical realist have to meet the challenge?\n\nTo focus our discussion, assume this metaphysical variant of Strong\nIntuitive (cf. Rosen 2020):\n\nIntuitive Metaphysical\n\nIf two metaphysically possible entities are alike in all base\nrespects, they are alike in all ethical respects.\n\n\nIntuitive Metaphysical might pose a challenge to the ethical realist\nin light of one of at least two background ideas. First, some\nphilosophers have argued that there are no necessary connections\nbetween \u201cdistinct existences,\u201d a claim that is sometimes\ncalled Hume\u2019s dictum. If Hume\u2019s dictum is correct, then\nthe ethical realist will be committed to the ethical not being\ndistinct in the relevant sense from what it supervenes on. The\nmetaphysical use of Hume\u2019s dictum faces at least two formidable\nchallenges. The first is to clarify the dictum in such a way that it\nis both interesting and a plausible candidate for truth. To see this,\nnote that many non-identical properties are necessarily connected: for\nexample, a surface\u2019s being scarlet entails that it is red, but\nbeing scarlet is not identical to being red. Red and scarlet, then,\nmust not count as distinct in the sense relevant to a plausible form\nof the dictum. This raises the question: what does distinctness amount\nto? If we use necessary connection as a criterion, then Hume\u2019s\ndictum turns out to be a trivial way of tracking this way of using the\nword \u2018distinct\u2019. Second, Hume\u2019s dictum is usually\ndefended on directly intuitive grounds. This raises a deep\nmethodological question: if we notice a conflict between Hume\u2019s\ndictum and another intuitively plausible claim, why should we retain\nHume\u2019s dictum and jettison the other claim? (For helpful\ndiscussion of Hume\u2019s Dictum, see Wilson 2010).\n\nConsider a second way of developing a challenge to the ethical\nrealist, inspired by the Sidgwickian motivation for accepting ethical\nsupervenience, introduced in\n Section 2.\n According to this motivation, we should accept an ethical\nsupervenience thesis because doing so rules out the implausible\nhypothesis of brute ethical contingency. Intuitive Metaphysical\nclearly satisfies this motivation: it permits no brutely contingent\nethical variation. However, suppose that it was not possible to\nexplain why the ethical properties supervene on the base properties.\nThen the very thesis that we used to explain why there was no brute\nethical contingency would turn out to be something arguably even more\npeculiar. It would be a metaphysically necessary connection that\nnonetheless has what Sidgwick might call an \u201carbitrary element\nin which we have to acquiesce;\u201d in a slogan: a brute\nnecessity.\n\nA natural way of thinking about the significance of brute necessity\nbegins with the assumption that we are entitled to a default\ncombinatorial assumption about modality: that for any pair of\nproperties F and G, it is possible that there is an\nx that is both F and G, that x is\nonly one and not the other, and that there is an x that is\nneither F nor G. The next step is to suggest that\nthis default assumption can be defeated. Consider red and scarlet: on\none view, to be red just is to be scarlet or crimson or cherry red\nor\u2026 The thesis that this is what it is to be red, if true,\nwould provide a straightforward explanation of why the combinatorial\nassumption is defeated here: it is not possible for something to be\nscarlet but not red precisely because of what it is to be red. Where\nwe take there to be no such explanation however, we should be loathe\nto accept an alleged necessary connection (cf. McPherson (2012); for a\nsimilar idea in a different context, compare Levine and Trogdon 2009).\nCall this constraint on our metaphysical theorizing\nanti-brutalism.\n\nBoth Hume\u2019s dictum and anti-brutalism put us in a position to\npose a conditional challenge to the ethical realist. If the realist\nthinks that the ethical properties are distinct from the base\nproperties, they must reject either metaphysical supervenience or\nHume\u2019s dictum. And if they think the supervenience of the\nethical is a brute necessity, they need to explain why such brutalism\nis not objectionable. Different variants of ethical realism have\ndifferent resources available to address this challenge. The remainder\nof this section examines some of these resources.\n",
