    "main_text": "The Moral Debate || Populism and a new face of nationalism\n3.4 Populism and a new face of nationalism\n\n\u201cPopulism\u201d is an umbrella term, covering both right-wing\nand left-wing varieties. This section will pay attention to right-wing\npopulist movements, very close to their traditional nationalist\npredecessors. This corresponds to the situation in the biggest part of\nEurope, and in the US, where nationalist topics are being put forward\nby the right-wing\n populist.[27]\n\nHowever, it has become quite clear that nationalism is only one of the\npolitical \u201cisms\u201d attracting the right-wing populists. The\nmigration crisis has brought to the forefront populist\nself-identification with linguistic-cultural communities (\u201cwe,\nFrench speaking people\u201d for the former, \u201cwe\nChristians\u201d for the later) that goes beyond nationalism.\n\nJan-Werner M\u00fcller (2016) and Cas Mudde (2007) note that the form\ncommon to all sorts of populism is quite simple and describe it as\n\u201cthin\u201d. Mudde explains: \u201cPopulism is understood as a\nthin-centered ideology that considers society to be ultimately\nseparated into two homogeneous and antagonistic groups, \u2018the\npure people\u2019 versus \u2018the corrupt elite\u2019, and which\nargues that politics should be an expression of the volont\u00e9\ng\u00e9n\u00e9rale (general will) of the People\u201d (2007:\n23). Populism, so defined, has two opposites: elitism and pluralism.\nFirst, there is the elite vs. people (\u201cunderdog\u201d)\ncontrast. Second, it is possible to distinguish two ways of\ncharacterizing \u201cthe people\u201d: either in terms of social\nstatus (class, income-level, etc.) or in terms of ethnic and/or\ncultural belonging (see also de Cleen 2017).\n\n\n Elite\n\u2193\n\nSocial (class)\n \u2190\n People \n \u2192 \n ethnic, cultural\n\n\n\nThe second, horizontal dimension distinguishes the predominantly\nleft-wing from the predominantly right-wing populisms and leaves a\nplace for a centrist populist option. Take classical strong ethnic\nnationalism. The relation between right-wing populism and such a\nnationalism is very tight. This has led some theoreticians (Taguieff\n2015) to present \u201cnationalist populism\u201d as the only kind\nof populism. The term captures exactly the synthesis of populism and\nthe strong ethnic nationalism or nativism. From populism, it takes the\ngeneral schema of anti-elitism: the leader is addressing directly the\npeople and is allegedly following the people\u2019s interest.  From\nnationalism, it takes the characterization of the people: it is the\nethnic community, in most cases the state-owing ethnic community, or\nthe ethno-nation. In his work, Mudde documents the claim that purely\nright-wing populists claim to represent the true people who form the\ntrue nation and whose purity is being muddied by new entrants. In the\nUnited States, one can talk about populist and reactionary movements,\nlike the Tea Party, that have emerged through the recent experience of\nimmigration, terrorist attacks, and growing economic polarization. We\nhave to set aside here, for reasons of space, the main populist\nalternative (or quasi-alternative) to national populism. In some\ncountries, like Germany, some populist groups-parties (e.g., German\nAfD party (Alternative for Germany)), appeal to properties much wider\nin their reach than ethno-national belonging, typically to religious\naffiliations. Others combine this appeal with the ethno-national\none. This yields what Riva Kastoryano (2006) calls \u201ctransnational\nnationalism\u201d.\n\nInterestingly, liberal nationalism is not very attractive to the\npopulists. On the theoretical side one can note that Tamir (2019) sees\nher liberal nationalism as a good recipe against the threat of\ndemagogues like Trump and Boris Johnson (she avoids the use of the\nlabel \u201cpopulist\u201d, e.g., 2019: 31).\n\nThe rise of populism is changing the political playfield one must work\nwith. The tolerant (liberal nationalist or anti-nationalist) views are\nconfronting new problems in the populist age marked by migration\ncrisis, etc. The dangers traditionally associated with military\npresence are gone; the national populists have to invent and construct\na presumed danger that comes into the country together with foreign\nfamilies, including those with children. In short, if these\nconjectures hold, the politicians and theoreticians are faced with a\nchange. The traditional issue of the contrast between\npatriotism/nationalism and cosmopolitanism has changed its profile:\nthe current drastic contrast is between the populist aversion to the\nforeigners-migrants and a more generous attitude of acceptance and\nSamaritan help. Finally, the populist understanding of \u201cour\npeople\u201d (\u201cwe-community\u201d) encompasses not only\nnationalist options but also goes way beyond it. The important element\nis the promiscuous character of the populist choices. It is probable\nthat the future scholarship on nationalism will mainly focus on this\nnew and challenging playfield, with an aim to address the new contrast\nand locate kinds of nationalism in relation to\n it.[28]\n",
