    "main_text": "Proofs for the existence of God (Allah) || An argument from necessity/possibility (wuj\u016bb/imk\u0101n)\n2.2 An argument from necessity/possibility (wuj\u016bb/imk\u0101n)\n\nCertainly, one of the most discussed arguments for the existence of\nGod in the medieval Islamic world was Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s\nBurh\u0101n al-Sidd\u012bq\u012bn, which can be translated as\n\u2018the demonstration of the truthful\u2019 (Avicenna\nal-Naj\u0101t, 261\u20135 & 271\u20133 = MR07:\n211\u201316 & ITN1: 4.16\u201320; see also Morewedge 1979; Mayer\n2001; McGinnis 2010b: 163\u20138; Byrne 2019 and Zarepour 2022). Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101\u2019s proof is unique in that it does not appeal to\nthe impossibility of infinite causal series, as most cosmological\narguments, and even entertains the possibility of an actual infinity\nof causes existing simultaneously, although the argument ultimately\nshows that such a causal series is impossible. Additionally, it shows\nthat the world is causally dependent upon God for its existence at\nevery moment that it exists, even infinitely into the past.\n\nThe proof is embedded within Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s own modal\nmetaphysics (see entry on\n Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s metaphysics).\n He began by laying out the logical space when considering existents,\nand conceptually distinguishes between a necessary existent through\nitself (w\u0101jib al-wuj\u016bd bi-dh\u0101tihi) and a\npossible or contingent existent through itself (mumkin\nal-wuj\u016bd bi-dh\u0101tihi). The necessary existent through\nitself would be an entity whose existence is self-explaining and so\nexists simply on account of what it is\u2014it cannot not exist. In\ncontrast, a possible existent in itself exists on account of something\nother than itself (bi-ghayrihi)\u2014it can not exist, and\nso there is something other that explains why it exists when it does.\nAgain, these distinctions are merely the logically possible ways of\nthinking of existents. We can safely take it that at least some\nthings, perhaps all things, are possible existents in themselves, for\ncertainly most things around us, considered in themselves, are\nindifferent to whether they exist or do not exist. The question is\nwhether the conceptual space of the necessary existent through itself\nis empty or occupied.\n\nTo this question, Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 begins by considering what would\neven count as such an existent. At least one feature of such an\nentity, Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 argues, is that it must be absolutely\nsimple. His argument assumes two modest mereological claims: one, a\nwhole (jumla) exists through its parts and, two, parts are\nother than the whole. Now assume that the whole of the necessary\nexistent through itself is not simple and so consists of parts. On the\nbasis of the first mereological assumption, if the whole of the\nnecessary existent through itself consisted of parts, then its\nnecessary existence would be through those parts; however,\nfrom the second assumptions those parts are other than the\nwhole. Consequently, the whole of the necessary existent through\nitself would be necessary through another. To be \u2018through\nanother\u2019, however, is to be through what is not itself.\nWe have a contradiction: the whole of the necessary existent\nthrough itself exists through not itself. Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101 concludes, the necessary existent through itself,\nshould it exist, must be simple. Again, Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 is not\nclaiming that anything meets this description. He is merely describing\nwhat would count as a necessary existent through itself. It is still\nan open question whether anything exists as absolutely simple and\nnecessary through itself.\n\nWith these preliminaries in place, we turn to Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101\u2019s proof proper. Clearly, something, x,\nexists, and so must be either a necessary or a possible existent\nthrough itself\u2014these exhaust the possibilities. If x is\na necessary existent through itself, the argument is complete. If\nx is a possible existent through itself, then Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101 asks us to consider x along with all and only\nthe other possible existents through themselves, y,\nz \u2026 n, which currently exist. Let the whole of all and\nonly things that are possible existents in themselves be W.\nSince W currently exists, it itself must be either a\nnecessary or possible existent in itself, given Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101\u2019s modal ontology. W cannot exist as\nnecessary through itself, since it consists of the parts x,\ny, z \u2026 n, which are possible\nexistents, and as seen what is a necessary existent through itself\ncannot have parts but is absolutely simple. Consequently, W\nis possible through itself but exists through another. This other,\no, either is included within W or is outside of\nW. If o is within W, then, because\no exists, it is either a necessary or a possible existent\nthrough itself. It cannot be a necessary existent through itself,\nsince only possible existents were included in W,\nand so there would be a contradiction. Likewise, o cannot be\na possible existent through itself, for it is through o that\nW and so all the members of W exist, which includes\no. Thus, o would exist through itself, and so would\nbe a necessary existent through itself. Even if one allowed circular\ncausation, which Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 subsequently rebuts, o\nultimately, albeit indirectly, still would be necessary through\nitself. We assumed, however, that o was a possible existent\nthrough itself, a contradiction. Since o cannot exist in\nW either as a necessary or as a possible existent through\nitself on pain of contradiction, and yet those are the only\nconceptually possible ways something can exist, o must exist\noutside of W. Since W included all and only possible\nexistents through themselves, the only thing outside of W is\nthe Necessary Existent through itself, which Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\nidentified with God.\n",
