    "main_text": "Further Philosophical Issues || Setting the Stage: Candidate Ontologies\n5.1 Setting the Stage: Candidate Ontologies\n\n\nOntology is concerned with the most general features, entities and\nstructures of being. One can pursue ontology in a very general sense\nor with respect to a particular theory or a particular part or aspect\nof the world. With respect to the ontology of QFT one is tempted to\nmore or less dismiss ontological inquiries and to adopt the following\nstraightforward view. There are two groups of fundamental fermionic\nmatter constituents, two groups of bosonic force carriers and four\n(including gravitation) kinds of interactions. As satisfying as this\nanswer might first appear, the ontological questions are, in a sense,\nnot even touched. Saying that, for instance the down quark is a\nfundamental constituent of our material world is the starting point\nrather than the end of the (philosophical) search for an ontology of\nQFT. The main question is what kind of entity, e.g., the down quark\nis. The answer does not depend on whether we think of down quarks or\nmuon neutrinos since the sought features are much more general than\nthose ones which constitute the difference between down quarks or muon\nneutrinos. The relevant questions are of a different type. What are\nparticles at all? Can quantum particles be legitimately understood as\nparticles any more, even in the broadest sense, when we take, e.g.,\ntheir localization properties into account? How can one spell out\nwhat a field is and can \u201cquantum fields\u201d in fact be\nunderstood as fields? Could it be more appropriate not to think of,\ne.g., quarks, as the most fundamental entities at all, but rather of\nproperties or processes or events?\n5.1.1 The Particle Interpretation\n\n\nMany of the creators of QFT can be found in one of the two camps\nregarding the question whether particles or fields should be given\npriority in understanding QFT. While Dirac, the later Heisenberg,\nFeynman, and Wheeler opted in favor of particles, Pauli, the early\nHeisenberg, Tomonaga and Schwinger put fields first (see Landsman\n1996). Today, there are a number of arguments which prepare the\nground for a proper discussion beyond mere preferences.\n5.1.1.1 The Particle Concept\n\n\nIt seems almost impossible to talk about elementary particle\nphysics, or QFT more generally, without thinking of particles which\nare accelerated and scattered in colliders. Nevertheless, it is this\nvery interpretation which is confronted with the most fully developed\ncounter-arguments. There still is the option to say that our classical\nconcept of a particle is too narrow and that we have to loosen some of\nits constraints. After all, even in classical corpuscular theories of\nmatter the concept of an (elementary) particle is not as unproblematic\nas one might expect. For instance, if the whole charge of a particle\nwas contracted to a point, an infinite amount of energy would be\nstored in this particle since the repulsive forces become infinitely\nlarge when two charges with the same sign are brought together. The\nso-called self energy of a point particle is infinite.\n\n\nProbably the most immediate trait of particles is their\ndiscreteness. Particles are countable or \u2018aggregable\u2019\nentities in contrast to a liquid or a mass. Obviously this\ncharacteristic alone cannot constitute a sufficient condition for\nbeing a particle since there are other things which are countable as\nwell without being particles, e.g., money or maxima and minima of the\nstanding wave of a vibrating string. It seems that one also\nneeds individuality, i.e., it must be possible to say that it\nis this or that particle which has been counted in order to account\nfor the fundamental difference between ups and downs in a wave pattern\nand particles. Teller (1995) discusses a specific conception of\nindividuality, primitive thisness, as well as other possible\nfeatures of the particle concept in comparison to classical concepts\nof fields and waves, as well as in comparison to the concept of field\nquanta, which is the basis for the interpretation that Teller\nadvocates. A critical discussion of Teller\u2019s reasoning can be found\nin Seibt (2002). Moreover, there is an extensive debate on\nindividuality of quantum objects in quantum mechanical systems of\n\u2018identical particles\u2019. Since this discussion concerns QM\nin the first place, and not QFT, any further details shall be omitted\nhere. French and Krause (2006) offer a detailed analysis of the\nhistorical, philosophical and mathematical aspects of the connection\nbetween quantum statistics, identity and individuality. See Dieks and\nLubberdink (2011) for a critical assessment of the debate. Also\nconsult the entry on\n quantum theory: identity and individuality.\n\n\n\nThere is still another feature which is commonly taken to be pivotal\nfor the particle concept, namely that particles are localizable in\nspace. While it is clear from classical physics already that the\nrequirement of\nlocalizability need not refer to point-like localization, we\nwill see that even localizability in an arbitrarily large but still\nfinite region can be a strong condition for quantum particles. Bain\n(2011) argues that the classical notions of localizability and\ncountability are inappropriate requirements for particles if one is\nconsidering a relativistic theory such as QFT.\n\n\n\nEventually, there are some potential ingredients of the particle\nconcept which are explicitly opposed to the corresponding (and\ntherefore opposite) features of the field concept. Whereas it is a\ncore characteristic of a field that it is a system with an infinite\nnumber of degrees of freedom, the very opposite holds for\nparticles. A particle can for instance be referred to by the\nspecification of the coordinates \\(\\mathbf{x}(t)\\)\nthat pertain, e.g., to its center of mass\u2014presupposing\nimpenetrability. A further feature of the particle concept is\nconnected to the last point and again explicitly in opposition to the\nfield concept. In a pure particle ontology the interaction between\nremote particles can only be understood as an action at a\ndistance. In contrast to that, in a field ontology, or a\ncombined ontology of particles and fields, local action is\nimplemented by mediating fields. Finally, classical particles are\nmassive and impenetrable, again in contrast to (classical) fields.\n5.1.1.2 Why QFT Seems to be About Particles\n\n\nThe easiest way to quantize the electromagnetic (or: radiation) field\nconsists of two steps. First, one Fourier analyses the vector\npotential of the classical field into normal modes (using periodic\nboundary conditions) corresponding to an infinite but denumerable\nnumber of degrees of freedom. Second, since each mode is described\nindependently by a harmonic oscillator equation, one can apply the\nharmonic oscillator treatment from non-relativistic quantum mechanics\nto each single mode. The result for the Hamiltonian of the radiation\nfield is\n\n\\[\\tag{5.1}\nH_{\\text{rad}} = \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}} \\sum_{r}\n\\hslash \\omega_{\\mathbf{k}} (a_{r}^{\\dagger}(\\mathbf{k})\\cdot a_r (\\mathbf{k}) + 1/2),\n\\]\n\n\n\nwhere \\(a_{r}^{\\dagger}(\\mathbf{k})\\)\nand \\(a_r (\\mathbf{k})\\) are operators which\nsatisfy the following commutation relations\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\tag{5.2} \n  [a_r (\\mathbf{k}), a_s^{\\dagger}(\\mathbf{k}')] &= \\delta_{rs}\\delta_{\\mathbf{kk}'} \\\\\n  [a_r (\\mathbf{k}), a_s (\\mathbf{k}')] &= [a_{r}^{\\dagger}(\\mathbf{k}), a_{s}^{\\dagger}(\\mathbf{k}')] = 0.\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n\nwith the index \\(r\\) labeling the polarisation. These\ncommutation relations imply that one is dealing with a bosonic field.\n\n\n\nThe operators \\(a_{r}^{\\dagger}(\\mathbf{k})\\)\nand \\(a_r (\\mathbf{k})\\)\nhave interesting physical interpretations as so-called particle\ncreation and annihilation operators. In order to see this, one has to\nexamine the eigenvalues of the operators\n\n\\[\\tag{5.3}\n N_r (\\mathbf{k}) = a_{r}^{\\dagger}(\\mathbf{k})\\cdot a_r (\\mathbf{k})\n\\]\n\n \n\nwhich are the essential parts in \\(H_{rad}\\). Due to\nthe commutation relations (5.2) one finds that the eigenvalues of\n\\(N_r (\\mathbf{k})\\) are the integers\n\\(n_r (\\mathbf{k}) = 0, 1, 2,\\ldots\\) and the\ncorresponding eigenfunctions (up to a normalisation factor) are \n\n\\[\\tag{5.4}\n|n_r (\\mathbf{k})\\rangle = [a_{r}^{\\dagger}(\\mathbf{k})]^{n_r (\\mathbf{k})}|0\\rangle\n\\]\n\n\n \nwhere the right hand side means that \\(a_{r}^{\\dagger}(\\mathbf{k})\\)\noperates \\(n_r (\\mathbf{k})\\) times on \\(|0\\rangle\\), the state vector\nof the vacuum with no photons present.  The interpretation of these\nresults is parallel to the one of the harmonic\noscillator. \\(a_{r}^{\\dagger}(\\mathbf{k})\\) is interpreted as\nthe creation operator of a photon with momentum \\(\\hslash\n\\mathbf{k}\\) and energy \\(\\hslash \\omega_{\\mathbf{k}}\\) (and a\npolarisation which depends on \\(r\\) and \\(\\mathbf{k})\\).  That is,\nequation (5.4) can be understood in the following way. One gets a\nstate with \\(n_r (\\mathbf{k})\\) photons of momentum \\(\\hslash\n\\mathbf{k}\\) and energy \\(\\hslash \\omega_{\\mathbf{k}}\\) when the\ncreation operator \\(a_{r}^{\\dagger}(\\mathbf{k})\\) operates \\(n_r\n(\\mathbf{k})\\) times on the vacuum state \\(|0\\rangle\\). Accordingly,\n\\(N_r (\\mathbf{k})\\) is called the number operator and \\(n_r\n(\\mathbf{k})\\) the \u2018occupation number\u2019 of the mode that is\nspecified by \\(\\mathbf{k}\\) and \\(r\\), i.e., this mode is occupied by\n\\(n_r (\\mathbf{k})\\) photons. Note that Pauli\u2019s exclusion\nprinciple is not violated since it only applies to fermions and not to\nbosons like photons. The corresponding interpretation for\nthe annihilation operator \\(a_r (\\mathbf{k})\\) is parallel:\nWhen it operates on a state with a given number of photons this number\nis lowered by one.\n\n\nIt is a widespread view that these results complete \u201cthe\njustification for interpreting \\(N(k)\\) as the number\noperator, and hence for the particle interpretation of the quantized\ntheory\u201d (Ryder 1996: 131). This is a rash judgement,\nhowever. For instance, the question of localizability is not even\ntouched while it is certain that this is a pivotal criterion for\nsomething to be a particle. All that is established so far is that\ncertain mathematical quantities in the formalism are\ndiscrete. However, countability is merely one feature of particles and\nnot at all conclusive evidence for a particle interpretation of\nQFT yet. It is not clear at this stage whether we are in fact\ndealing with particles or with fundamentally different objects which\nonly have this one feature of discreteness in common with\nparticles.\n\nTeller (1995) argues that the Fock space or \u201coccupation number\u201d representation does support a particle ontology in terms\nof field quanta since these can be counted or aggregated,\nalthough not numbered. The degree of excitation of a certain mode of\nthe underlying field determines the number of objects, i.e., the\nparticles in the sense of quanta. Labels for individual particles like\nin the Schr\u00f6dinger many-particle formalism do not occur any more,\nwhich is the crucial deviation from the classical notion of\nparticles. However, despite of this deviation, says Teller, quanta\nshould be regarded as particles: Besides their countability another\nfact that supports seeing quanta as particles is that they have the\nsame energies as classical particles. Teller has been criticized for\ndrawing unduly far-reaching ontological conclusions from one\nparticular representation, in particular since the Fock space\nrepresentation cannot be appropriate in general because it is only\nvalid for free particles (see, e.g., Fraser 2008). In order to avoid\nthis problem Bain (2000) proposes an alternative quanta interpretation\nthat rests on the notion of asymptotically free states in scattering\ntheory. For a further discussion of the quanta interpretation see the\nsubsection on inequivalent representations below.\n\nThe vacuum state \\(|0\\rangle\\) is the energy ground state, i.e., the\neigenstate of the energy operator with the lowest eigenvalue. It is a\nremarkable result in ordinary non-relativistic QM that the ground\nstate energy of e.g., the harmonic oscillator is not zero in\ncontrast to its analogue in classical mechanics. In addition to this,\nthe relativistic vacuum of QFT has the even more striking\nfeature that the expectation values for various quantities do not\nvanish, which prompts the question what it is that has these values or\ngives rise to them if the vacuum is taken to be the state with no\nparticles present. If particles were the basic objects of QFT how can\nit be that there are physical phenomena even if nothing is there\naccording to this very ontology? Eventually, studies of QFT in curved\nspace-time indicate that the existence of a particle number operator\nmight be a contingent property of the flat Minkowski space-time,\nbecause Poincar\u00e9 symmetry is used to pick out a preferred\nrepresentation of the canonical commutation relations which is\nequivalent to picking out a preferred vacuum state (see Wald\n1994).\n\nBefore exploring whether other (potentially) necessary requirements\nfor the applicability of the particle concept are fulfilled let us see\nwhat the alternatives are. Proceeding this way makes it easier to\nevaluate the force of the following arguments in a more balanced\nmanner.\n\n5.1.2 The Field Interpretation\n\nSince various arguments seem to speak against a particle\ninterpretation, the allegedly only alternative, namely a field\ninterpretation, is often taken to be the appropriate ontology of\nQFT. So let us see what a physical field is and why QFT may be\ninterpreted in this sense. A classical point particle can be\ndescribed by its position \\(\\mathbf{x}(t)\\) and its\nmomentum \\(\\mathbf{p}(t)\\), which change as the\ntime \\(t\\) progresses. So there are six degrees of freedom for\nthe motion of a point particle corresponding to the three coordinates\nof the particle\u2019s position and three more coordinates for its\nmomentum. In the case of a classical field one has an independent\nvalue for each single point \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) in space, where this\nspecification changes as time progresses. The field value \\(\\phi\\) can be\na scalar quantity, like temperature, a vectorial one as for the\nelectromagnetic field, or a tensor, such as the stress tensor for a\ncrystal. A field is therefore specified by a time-dependent mapping\nfrom each point of space to a field value\n\\(\\phi(\\mathbf{x},t)\\). Thus a field is a system with\nan infinite number of degrees of freedom, which may be restrained by\nsome field equations. Whereas the intuitive notion of a field is that\nit is something transient and fundamentally different from matter, it\ncan be shown that it is possible to ascribe energy and momentum to a\npure field even in the absence of matter. This somewhat surprising\nfact shows how gradual the distinction between fields and matter\ncan be.\n\n\nThe transition from a classical field theory to a quantum field theory\nis characterized by the occurrence of operator-valued quantum\nfields \\(\\hat{\\phi}(\\mathbf{x},t)\\), and corresponding conjugate\nfields, for both of which certain canonical commutation relations\nhold. Thus there is an obvious formal analogy between classical and\nquantum fields: in both cases field values are attached to space-time\npoints, where these values are specified by real numbers in the case\nof classical fields and operators in the case of quantum fields. That\nis, the mapping \\(\\mathbf{x} \\mapsto \\hat{\\phi}(\\mathbf{x},t)\\) in QFT\nis analogous to the classical mapping \\(\\mathbf{x} \\mapsto\n\\phi(\\mathbf{x},t)\\).  Due to this formal analogy it appears to be\nbeyond any doubt that QFT is a field theory.\n\n\n\nBut is a systematic association of certain mathematical terms with all\npoints in space-time really enough to establish a field theory in a\nproper physical sense? Is it not essential for a physical field theory\nthat some kind of real physical properties are allocated to\nspace-time points? This requirement seems not fulfilled in QFT,\nhowever. Teller (1995: ch. 5) argues that the expression quantum\nfield is only justified on a \u201cperverse reading\u201d of\nthe notion of a field, since no definite physical values whatsoever\nare assigned to space-time points. Instead, quantum field operators\nrepresent the whole spectrum of possible values so that they rather\nhave the status of observables (Teller: \u201cdeterminables\u201d)\nor general solutions. Only a specific configuration, i.e., an\nascription of definite values to the field observables at all points\nin space, can count as a proper physical field.\n\n\nThere are at least four proposals for a field interpretation of QFT,\nall of which respect the fact that the operator-valuedness of quantum\nfields impedes their direct reading as physical fields.\n\n(i) Teller (1995) argues that definite physical quantities emerge when\nnot only the quantum field operators but also the state of the system\nis taken into account. More specifically, for a given state \\(|\\psi \\rangle\\)\none can calculate the expectation values\n\\(\\langle \\psi |\\phi(x)|\\psi \\rangle\\) which yields an ascription of\ndefinite physical values to all points x in space and thus\na configuration of the operator-valued quantum field that may\nbe seen as a proper physical field. The main problem with proposal\n(i), and possibly with (ii), too, is that an expectation value is the\naverage value of a whole sequence of measurements, so that it does not\nqualify as the physical property of any actual single field system, no\nmatter whether this property is a pre-existing (or categorical) value\nor a propensity (or disposition).\n\n\n(ii) The vacuum expectation value or VEV interpretation,\nadvocated by Wayne (2002), exploits a theorem by Wightman\n(1956). According to this reconstruction theorem all the information\nthat is encoded in quantum field operators can be equivalently\ndescribed by an infinite hierarchy of \\(n\\)-point vacuum\nexpectation values, namely the expectation values of all products of\nquantum field operators at \\(n\\) (in general different)\nspace-time points, calculated for the vacuum state. Since this\ncollection of vacuum expectation values comprises only definite\nphysical values it qualifies as a proper field configuration, and,\nWayne argues, due to Wightman\u2019s theorem, so does the equivalent set of\nquantum field operators. Thus, and this is the upshot of Wayne\u2019s\nargument, an ascription of quantum field operators to all space-time\npoints does by itself constitute a field configuration, namely for the\nvacuum state, even if this is not the actual state.\n\nBut this is also a problem for the VEV interpretation: While it shows\nnicely that much more information is encoded in the quantum field\noperators than just unspecifically what could be measured, it still\ndoes not yield anything like an actual field\nconfiguration. While this last requirement is likely to be too strong\nin a quantum theoretical context anyway, the next proposal may come at\nleast somewhat closer to it.\n\n(iii) In recent years the term wave functional interpretation\nhas been established as the name for the default field interpretation\nof QFT. Correspondingly, it is the most widely discussed extant\nproposal; see, e.g., Huggett (2003), Halvorson and M\u00fcger (2007),\nBaker (2009) and Lupher (2010). In effect, it is not very different\nfrom proposal (i), and with further assumptions for (i) even\nidentical. However, proposal (ii) phrases things differently and in a\nvery appealing way. The basic idea is that quantized fields should be\ninterpreted completely analogously to quantized one-particle states,\njust as both result analogously from imposing canonical commutation\nrelations on the non-operator-valued classical quantities. In the case\nof a quantum mechanical particle, its state can be described by a wave\nfunction \\(\\psi\\)(x), which maps positions to probability amplitudes,\nwhere \\(|\\psi(x)|^2\\) can be interpreted as the\nprobability for the particle to be measured at\nposition \\(x\\). For a field, the analogue of positions are\nclassical field configurations \\(\\phi(x)\\), i.e., assignments of\nfield values to points in space. And so, the analogy continues, just\nas a quantum particle is described by a wave function that maps\npositions to probabilities (or rather probability amplitudes) for the\nparticle to be measured at \\(x\\), quantum fields can be\nunderstood in terms of wave functionals\n\\(\\psi[\\phi(x)\\)] that map functions to numbers, namely\nclassical field configurations \\(\\phi(x)\\) to probability\namplitudes, where \\(|\\psi[\\phi(x)]|^2\\) can be\ninterpreted as the probability for a given quantum field system to be\nfound in configuration \\(\\phi(x)\\) when measured. Thus just as\na quantum state in ordinary single-particle QM can be interpreted as a\nsuperposition of classical localized particle states, the state of a\nquantum field system, so says the wave functional approach, can be\ninterpreted as a superposition of classical field configurations. And\nwhat superpositions mean depends on one\u2019s general interpretation of\nquantum probabilities (collapse with propensities, Bohmian hidden\nvariables, branching Everettian many-worlds,\u2026). In practice,\nhowever, QFT is hardly ever represented in wave functional space\nbecause usually there is little interest in measuring field\nconfigurations. Rather, one tries to measures \u2018particle\u2019 states and\ntherefore works in Fock space.\n\n\n(iv) For a modification of proposal (iii), indicated in Baker (2009:\nsec. 5) and explicitly formulated as an alternative interpretation by\nLupher (2010), see the end of the section \u201cNon-Localizability\nTheorems\u201d below.\n\n5.1.3 Ontic Structural Realism\n\nThe multitude of problems for particle as well as field\ninterpretations prompted a number of alternative ontological\napproaches to QFT. Auyang (1995) and Dieks (2002) propose different\nversions of event ontologies. Seibt (2002) and H\u00e4ttich (2004)\ndefend process-ontological accounts of QFT, which are scrutinized in\nKuhlmann (2002, 2010a: ch. 10). In recent years, however, ontic\nstructural realism (OSR) has become the most fashionable ontological\nframework for modern physics. While so far the vast majority of\nstudies concentrates on ordinary QM and General Relativity Theory, it\nseems to be commonly believed among advocates of OSR that their case\nis even stronger regarding QFT, in light of the paramount significance\nof symmetry groups (also see below)\u2014hence the name group\nstructural realism (Roberts 2010). Explicit arguments are few\nand far between, however.\n\n \nOne of the rare arguments in favor of OSR that deal specifically\nwith QFT is due to Kantorovich (2003), who opts for a Platonic version\nof OSR; a position that is otherwise not very popular among\nOSRists. Kantorovich argues that directly after the big bang\n\u201cthe world was baryon-free, whereas the symmetry of grand\nunification existed as an abstract structure\u201d (p. 673). Cao\n(1997b) points out that the best ontological access to QFT is gained\nby concentrating on structural properties rather than on any\nparticular category of entities. Cao (2010) advocates a\n\u201cconstructive structural realism\u201d on the basis of a\ndetailed conceptual investigation of the formation of quantum\nchromodynamics. However, Kuhlmann (2011) shows that Cao\u2019s position\nhas little to do with what is usually taken to be ontic structural\nrealism, and that it is not even clear whether it should at least be\nrated as an epistemic variant of structural realism.\n\n The central significance of gauge theories in modern physics may\nsupport structural realism. Lyre (2004) offers a case study concerning\nthe \\(\\mathrm{U}(1)\\) gauge symmetry group, which characterizes\nQED. Recently Lyre (2012) has been advocating an intermediate form of\nOSR, which he calls \u201cExtended OSR (ExtOSR)\u201d, according to\nwhich there are not only relational structural properties but also\nstructurally derived intrinsic properties, namely the invariants of\nstructure: mass, spin, and charge. Lyre claims that only ExtOSR is in\na position to account for gauge theories. Moreover, it can make sense\nof zero-value properties, such as the zero mass of photons.\n\n\nCategory theory could be a promising framework for OSR in general and QFT in particular, because the main reservation against the radical but also seemingly incoherent idea of relations without relata may depend on the common set theoretic framework. Bain (2013) offers a category theoretic formulation of such a radical OSR, Lam and W\u00fctrich (2015) a critique and Eva (2016) a defense. \nSee SEP entries on \n\nstructural realism \n\n(4.2 on OSR and QFT) and on \n\ncategory theory. \n\n\n\n5.1.4 Trope Ontology\n\nKuhlmann (2010a) proposes a Dispositional Trope Ontology (DTO)\nas the most appropriate ontological reading of the basic structure of\nQFT, in particular in its algebraic formulation, AQFT. The term\n\u2018trope\u2019 refers to a conception of properties that breaks\nwith tradition by regarding properties as particulars rather than\nrepeatables (or \u2018universals\u2019). This new conception of\nproperties permits analyzing objects as pure bundles of\nproperties/tropes without excluding the possibility of having\ndifferent objects with (qualitatively but not numerically) exactly the\nsame properties. One of Kuhlmann\u2019s crucial points is that (A)QFT\nspeaks in favor of a bundle conception of objects because the net\nstructure of observable algebras alone (see section \u201cBasic Ideas\nof AQFT\u201d above) encodes the fundamental features of a given\nquantum field theory, e.g., its charge structure.\n\nIn the DTO approach, the essential properties/tropes of a trope bundle\nare then identified with the defining characteristics of a\nsuperselection sector, such as different kinds of charges, mass and\nspin. Since these properties cannot change by any state transition\nthey guarantee the object\u2019s identity over time. Superselection\nsectors are inequivalent irreducible representations of the algebra of\nall quasi-local observables. While the essential properties/tropes of\nan object are permanent, its non-essential ones may change. Since we\nare dealing with quantum physical systems many properties are\ndispositions (or propensities); hence the name dispositional\ntrope ontology.\n\nA trope bundle is not individuated via spatio-temporal co-localization\nbut because of the particularity of its constitutive tropes. Morganti\n(2009) also advocates a trope-ontological reading of QFT, which refers\ndirectly to the classification scheme of the Standard Model.\n\n",
