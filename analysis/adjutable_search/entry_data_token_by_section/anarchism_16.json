    "main_text": "Objections and Replies || Anarchy Will Always Evolve Back into the State\n4.2 Anarchy Will Always Evolve Back into the State\n\nObjection: This objection holds that anarchism is\ninherently unstable. Hobbes and other early modern social contract\ntheories maintain that the state emerges as a necessary response to\nnatural anarchy which keeps order and protects our interests. A\ndifferent theory comes from Nozick, who argues that the\n\u201cnight-watchman state\u201d would emerge out of anarchy by an\ninvisible hand process: as people will exercise their liberty and\npurchase protection from a protection agency, which would eventually\nevolve into something like a minimal state.\n\nReply: Anarchists may argue that the state of nature\nis simply not a state of war and so that Hobbes\u2019s description is\nfalse. Some anarcho-primitivists will argue that things were much\nbetter for human beings in the original state of nature in small\ncommunities living close to the land. Other anarchists might argue\nthat the disadvantages of state organizations\u2014the creation of\nhierarchies, monopolies, inequalities, and the like\u2014simply\noutweigh the benefits of state structures; and that rational agents\nwould choose to remain in anarchy rather than allow the state to\nevolve. Some anarchists may argue that each time a state emerges, it\nwould have to be destroyed. But others will argue that education and\nhuman development (including technological development) would prevent\nthe reemergence of the state.\n",
