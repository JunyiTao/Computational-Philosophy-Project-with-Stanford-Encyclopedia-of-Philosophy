    "main_text": "Deontological Pacifism || Killing Combatants and Killing \u201cThe Guilty\u201d\n4.1 Killing Combatants and Killing \u201cThe Guilty\u201d\n\nOne aspect of the deontological condemnation of war focuses on the\nkilling of combatants, although the killing of combatants has also\nbeen connected to contingent pacifism by way of just war\ntheory\u2019s proportionality constraint (Bazargan 2014). A pacifist\nmight argue that it is wrong to kill enemy combatants because killing\nis always wrong. Such an argument runs counter to the just war ideal\nthat combatants can be killed. Critics will argue that pacifism thus\nfails to distinguish between \u201cinnocence\u201d and\n\u201cguilt.\u201d As Anscombe puts this, \u201cpacifism teaches\npeople to make no distinction between the shedding of innocent blood\nand the shedding of any human blood\u201d (Anscombe 1981a, 58) The\njust war tradition holds that it is permissible to kill enemy\ncombatants because these combatants are, in some sense, no longer\ninnocent. Those who claim that it is acceptable to kill enemy\ncombatants claim that enemy soldiers deserve to die; or at least that\nit is not wrong to kill them. There are open questions in just war\ntheory about how this notion of desert functions. One of the problems\nis that young conscripted soldiers may not fully support the war into\nwhich they are drafted; and thus it may seem odd to claim that such\nsoldiers are guilty for or deserve to be killed in a war for which\nthey hold no personal responsibility (see McMahan 2009). But the most\nobvious way to justify killing combatants is to link such killing to\nthe notion of self-defense. In war, soldiers are confronted with enemy\ncombatants who will kill them and their comrades, if they aren\u2019t\nkilled first. In the language of just war theory, an enemy combatant\nis guilty of the crime of aggression; and in the context of war, this\ncrime is punishable by death.\n\nThis notion of killing as punishment can easily be connected to the\nissue of the death penalty. For deontological proponents of the death\npenalty, murderers can be executed because the nature of their crime\nmerits death. While consequentialists add in other considerations such\nas the deterrent value of the death penalty, the deontological\napproach focuses on the moral desert that is connected to the guilt of\nthe murderer. This notion of guilt\u2014as a moral quality that\nadheres to an individual in light of his past actions\u2014is also\nfound in the idea that enemy combatants may be killed. Those\nindividuals who are engaged in fighting have done something (or have\nadopted some characteristic) that makes it permissible to kill\nthem.\n\nAbsolute and maximal versions of deontological pacifism maintain that\nkilling is never permitted, even the killing of enemy soldiers. They\nmay also claim that the death penalty is wrong; and they may deny that\nkilling in self-defense is ever justifiable. Opponents of war may also\ndeny that international aggression is punishable by death.\n\nA more subtle argument along these lines will claim that it is wrong\nto kill enemy combatants because enemy combatants are occasionally (or\nusually\u2014depending on the strength of this particular claim) not\nresponsible for their participation in war. This is especially true of\nconscript armies who are forced to fight. A pacifist might want to\nmake an exception for killing soldiers who have malicious intent; but\nthey may argue that it is immoral to kill soldiers who are forced to\nfight.\n",
