    "main_text": "Philosophical Controversies || Hermeneutics and Critical Theory\n6.1 Hermeneutics and Critical Theory\n\nOne important controversy about the consequences of Gadamer\u2019s\nphilosophical hermeneutics, then, concerns whether it offers a basis\nfor the critique of ideology. This concern is raised with emphasis by\nthe critical theorist J\u00fcrgen Habermas. Habermas, building on\nHegel, Marx and Engels, as well as his original theory of recognition\nand communication, maintains that an ideology is a nexus of political\ndoctrines, beliefs, and attitudes that distort the political realities\nthey purport to describe. Accordingly, ideologies reinforce equally\ndistorted power relations that, in turn, prevent the openness of\ndiscussion that is necessary for legitimate democratic political\ndeliberation and decision-making (see Sypnowich 2019, Sec. 2). In view of\nthis, one purpose of critical theory is to establish a basis to\ncritique ideology. Habermas and other critical theorists sought a\nbasis of critique with the ability to expose even some of our most\ncherished political doctrines, beliefs, and attitudes as ideological\ndistortions that result from forms of domination passed down from\ntradition.\n\nHabermas raises the objection against Gadamer\u2019s philosophical\nhermeneutics that the hermeneutical experience of truth offers too\nlittle basis for such critique (see Habermas, \u201cThe Universality\nClaim of\n Hermeneutics\u201d).[10]\n Habermas raises the objection that philosophical hermeneutics, with\nits adherence to the authority of tradition, leaves no room for the\ncritique of ideologies entrenched in the historically transmitted\nprejudices on which our experience of truth relies. Moreover, as we\nmight accordingly worry, what Gadamer describes as the hermeneutical\nexperience of truth might not be an experience of truth at all, but,\nrather, a distorted communication that is complicit in ideology, since\nthe so-called truth results from a conversation that might not be\nopen, but oriented by prejudices that reinforce relations of\ndomination.\n\nWhile the influence of Habermas\u2019s objection is extensive,\nGadamer has mounted rejoinders on behalf of his philosophical\nhermeneutics (see \u201cReply to My Critics\u201d; see also\n\u201cWhat is Practice? The Conditions of Social Reason\u201d). The\nthrust of Gadamer\u2019s argument is, first, that it is actually\nHabermas\u2019s position, not his own, that remains uncritical, since\nit is na\u00efve to believe in the possibility of a basis of critique\nthat is somehow not subject to the authority of tradition. And,\nGadamer stresses, second, that the hermeneutical experience of truth\nis no blind acceptance of the authority of tradition. Rather, as he\nargues, interpretive experience remains critical, in that such\nexperience unfolds precisely though the questioning of our prejudices,\nand judgment about what aspects of our prejudices remain valid and\nwhich have become invalid for matters of concern to us now.\n",
