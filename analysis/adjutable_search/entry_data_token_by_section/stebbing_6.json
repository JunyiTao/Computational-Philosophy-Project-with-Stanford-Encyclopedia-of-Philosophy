    "main_text": "Last Work and Legacy\n7. Conclusion\n\nStebbing played a major role in the development of analytic philosophy\nin the 1930s, writing what was in effect the first textbook of\nanalytic philosophy, A Modern Introduction to Logic (1930).\nAlthough she was a leading member of the Cambridge School of Analysis,\nwith Moore the strongest influence upon her, she also sought to engage\nwith logical positivism and thereby helped to bring the two together\ninto the wider movement that we now know as analytic philosophy. In\nher later writings she sought to show the relevance of her logical and\nanalytic work to everyday thinking and to social and political debate.\nPhilosophy and the Physicists (1937) and Thinking to Some\nPurpose (1939), her two most important books addressed to a more\ngeneral audience, can also be regarded as among the first books of\ncritical thinking, anticipating developments in sociolinguistics,\npragmatics and critical discourse analysis. Both her governing idea of\n\u201cpurposive thinking\u201d and the emphasis she placed on\nclarity of thought and expression were manifested in all her writing,\nwhich was also characterized\u2014as indeed, were her teaching and\norganizational activities\u2014by an exceptional degree of\nintellectual honesty and moral integrity.\n",
