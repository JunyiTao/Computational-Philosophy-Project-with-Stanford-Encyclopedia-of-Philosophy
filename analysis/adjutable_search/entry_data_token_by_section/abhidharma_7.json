    "main_text": "Causation: existence as functioning\n6. Epistemology: Perception and the theory of the consciousness process\n\nIn attempting to account for what effects liberating insight and what\nmakes up the awakened mind, Abhidharma inquiries extended into the\nfield of epistemology. We have seen that the Abhidharma\u2019s\nanalysis of sentient experience reveals that what we perceive as a\ntemporally extended, uninterrupted flow of phenomena is, in fact, a\nrapidly occurring sequence of causally connected consciousness moments\nor cittas (i.e., assemblages of citta and\ncaitta/cetasika), each with its particular object. The mature\nAbhidharma thus assimilates the analysis of\nphenomena-in-time-as-constituted-by-consciousness with a highly\ncomplex description of the consciousness process, dissolving the\ncausal relations between ordered successions of consciousness moments\ninto the activity of perception. As previously noted in section 2, for\nthe Abhidharma, as in Buddhist epistemology in general, sensory\nperception is the paradigm of perceptual, sentient experience. Like\nevery instance of consciousness, sensory perception is intentional,\nencapsulated in the interaction among the sense faculties, their\ncorresponding types of discriminative consciousness, and their\nappropriate sense objects. Different Buddhist schools, however, held\ndifferent positions on the distinctive nature of perceptual\nexperience, and on the specific roles of the sense faculties and\nstatus of sense objects in it. The Therav\u0101da Abhidhamma and the\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da-Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika both espouse a view that\nproposes a direct contact between perceptual consciousness and its\nsense objects, the latter being understood as sensibilia, for\nwhat we perceive are not objects of common sense but their sensible\nqualities. We may characterize this view as phenomenalist realism\n(Dreyfus 1997, 331 & 336).\n\nThe Therav\u0101da Abhidhamma sets out its theory of the consciousness\nprocess (citta-v\u012bthi) in its commentaries and manuals,\nmainly in the works of Buddhaghosa, Buddhadatta (5th century CE), and\nAnuruddha (10th or 11th century CE), based on earlier descriptions in\nthe Dhammasa\u1e45ga\u1e47i and the\nPa\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na (Vism XIV 111\u2013124,\nXVII 126\u2013145; Dhs-a 82\u2013106 & 267\u2013287;\nVibh-a 155\u2013160; Abhidh-s 17\u201321). The\ntheory is not separate from the dhamma taxonomy and the\nanalysis of citta as previously outlined in section 2.\nRather, in congruency with the notion of existence (whether categorial\nor ontological) as functioning, it analyzes sensory perception as\nresulting from particular functions that are performed by the\neighty-nine citta types revealed by the foregoing taxonomy.\nAccording to this analysis, the specific functions in the\nconsciousness flow occur at particular instants of that continuum, as\nthe normal flow of consciousness involves the mind picking up and\nputting down sense objects by means of successive sets of associated\nmental factors. The result is a fairly static account of mental and\nmaterial phenomena as they arise in consciousness over a series of\nconsciousness\n moments.[16]\n\nRestricting the account to the consciousness process of ordinary\nbeings, two types of process are described: five-sense-door processes\n(pa\u00f1cadv\u0101ra) and mind-door processes\n(manodv\u0101ra). These may occur in succession, or mind-door\nprocesses may occur independently. Five-sense-door processes account\nfor sensory perception as information is directly received from the\nfields of the five physical sense faculties. Mind-door processes\ninternalize the information received through the sense faculties and\ncharacterize the mind that is absorbed in thought or memory. Objects\nat the \u201cdoor\u201d of the mind, which is treated in Buddhist\nthought as a sixth sense faculty, may be past, present, or future,\npurely conceptual or even transcendent. Normally, however, the object\nat the mind door will be either a past memory or a concept. If there\nis no perceptual activity, as is the case in deep, dreamless sleep,\nthe mind is in a state of rest called inactive mode\n(bhava\u1e45ga). Throughout one\u2019s life, the same type\nof citta performs this function of the inactive mind that is\nthe natural mode to which the mind reverts. The mind switches from its\ninactive mode to a simple mind-door process when a concept or memory\noccurs and no attention is directed to the other five sense fields.\nThe simplest mind-door process is a succession of the following\nfunctions: 1) adverting to the object of thought: a function that\nlasts one moment and becomes internalized as an object support; 2)\nimpulsion: occurs for up to seven moments and performs the function of\nthe mind\u2019s responding actively to the object with wholesome or\nunwholesome karma; 3) retaining: holding on to the object of the\nconsciousness process for one or two moments.\n\nThe mind switches from its inactive mode to any of the five-sense-door\nprocesses when an object occurs at the \u201cdoor\u201d of the\nappropriate sense faculty. This process of sensory perception involves\na greater number of functions: 1) disturbed inactive mind: a function\nthat arises due to the stimulus of the sense object. It lasts for two\nmoments, during which sensory contact takes place, i.e., a physical\nimpact of the sense object on the physical matter of the appropriate\nsense faculty; 2) adverting: lasts one moment, during which the mind\nturns towards the object at the appropriate sense \u201cdoor;\u201d\n3) perceiving: lasts one moment and is the sheer perception of the\nsense object with minimal interpretation; 4) receiving: lasts one\nmoment and performs the intermediary role of enabling transit to and\nfrom the appropriate discriminative consciousness, whether visual,\nauditory, etc.; 5) investigating: lasts one moment and performs the\nrole of establishing the nature of the sense object and of determining\nthe mind\u2019s response to that object that has just been\nidentified; 6) impulsion: same as in the mind-door process; 7)\nretaining: same as in the mind-door process. As an example, visual\nperception involves not only seeing itself, but also a succession of\nmoments of fixing of the visual object in the mind, recognition of its\ngeneral features, and identification of its nature. In both the\nmind-door and five-sense door processes, the sense faculty and its\nsense object condition the arising of a present moment of a\ncorresponding apprehending consciousness, that is, perception here is\nmodeled on simultaneous conditioning. And in both the mind-door and\nfive-sense door processes, when the retaining function ceases, the\nmind reenters its inactive mode.\n\nThe consciousness types that perform most of the functions that make\nup the mind-door and the five-sense-door processes fall into the\ncategory of resultant cittas, that is, those that are the\nresult of past actively wholesome or unwholesome consciousness. This\nmeans that the experience of the sense data presented to one\u2019s\nmind is determined by one\u2019s previous actions and is beyond of\none\u2019s immediate control. Whenever one remembers or\nconceptualizes, sees, hears, smells, tastes, or touches something that\nis desirable or pleasing, one experiences a result of previous\nwholesome consciousness. And vice versa with objects that are\nundesirable or unpleasing and previous unwholesome consciousness\nrespectively. Only in the final stage of the consciousness process,\nwhen the mind has chosen to respond actively to its object in some\nway, actively present wholesome or unwholesome consciousness operates\nand constitutes karma that will bear future results. The Abhidhamma\nthus \u201cprovides an exact small-scale analysis of the process of\ndependent arising\u201d (Gethin 1998, 216).\n\nThe Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da-Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika proposes a similar\naccount of sensory perception, but argues that the sensory object\nexists as a real entity. The Sautr\u0101ntika theory of perception,\nhowever, is rather different. It rests on the Sautr\u0101ntika radical\nview of momentariness, according to which there is no real duration\nbut only a succession of infinitesimal moments, and on its view of\ncausation, according to which causes cease to exist when their effects\ncome into existence. The application of these principles to sensory\nperception makes it difficult to explain how perception directly\napprehends sense objects, for it implies that objects have ceased when\ntheir apprehending consciousness arises. The Sautr\u0101ntika reply is\nthat consciousness does not have direct access to its sense objects.\nBy contrast to phenomenalist realism, the Sautr\u0101ntika view of\nperceptual consciousness may be characterized as representationalism:\nit sees perception as apprehending its objects indirectly, through the\nmediation of aspects (\u0101k\u0101ra) representative of\ntheir objects (Dreyfus 1997, 335 & 380\u2013381).\n\nWhat is common to all the three main Abhidharma\ntraditions\u2014Therav\u0101da, Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da, and\nSautr\u0101ntika\u2014is that they manifest a somewhat similar\nparadigm shift towards reducing the phenomenal, causally conditioned\nworld into the activity of cognition and consciousness. This shift was\npart of a broader movement in Indian philosophy in which Hindu, Jain,\nand Buddhist thinkers turned away from traditional metaphysical\nquestions about the nature of the external world and the self, and\nfocused instead on the study of epistemology, logic, and language.\nTheir purpose was to provide systematic accounts of the nature and\nmeans of valid cognition. Within Buddhist circles, this\nepistemological turn saw the rise of thinkers such as Asa\u1e45ga and\nVasubandhu, the founders of the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra (400\u2013480 CE),\nand, most notably, Dign\u0101ga and Dharmak\u012brti (around 500 CE)\nwho developed sophisticated logical and philosophical systems\n(ibid, 15\u201319). The Abhidharma, then, sets the stage for\nthis epistemological turn. The new emphasis becomes dominant from the\nperiod of the vibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101 compendia onward and is\nevident in a shift in the terminology used by the Abhidharma to\ndescribe the nature of dharmas. This terminological shift is\nindicated by the terms \u201cparticular inherent\ncharacteristic\u201d (Skt., svalak\u1e63a\u1e47a, Pali,\nsalakkha\u1e47a) and \u201cgeneral characteristic\u201d\n(Skt., s\u0101m\u0101nyalak\u1e63a\u1e47a, Pali,\ns\u0101m\u0101nyalakkha\u1e47a).\n\nThe term lak\u1e63a\u1e47a/lakkha\u1e47a means a mark, or\na specific characteristic that distinguishes an indicated object from\nothers. The Logicians use this term in the sense of\n\u201cdefinition\u201d of a concept or logical category. The\nAbhidharma applies it to the practice of the discernment of\ndharmas, distinguishing between multiple generic\ncharacteristics a dharma shares with other dharmas\nand (at least) one particular inherent characteristic that defines a\ndharma as that very individual occurrence distinct from any\nother instances of its type. The post-canonical Abhidharma thus\nassimilates the concept of the particular inherent characteristic with\nthat of intrinsic nature. \u201cDhammas,\u201d the\nTherav\u0101din commentarial literature states, \u201care so called\nbecause they bear their particular inherent characteristics\u201d\n(Vibh-a 45; Vibh-m\u1e6d 35; Pa\u1e6dis-a\nI 79; Vism XV 3), and a particular characteristic \u201cis\nthe intrinsic nature that is not held in common by other\ndhammas\u201d (Vism-mh\u1e6d II 137). Used in\nconjunction or interchangeably with intrinsic nature, the particular\ninherent characteristic constitutes a dhamma\u2019s unique\ndefinition (Vism VI 19, 35). It is an epistemological and\nlinguistic determinant of a dhamma as a knowable instance\nthat is defined by a distinct verbal description.\n\nThe Mah\u0101vibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101 of the\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da-Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika similarly distinguishes\nbetween a dharma\u2019s particular inherent and generic\ncharacteristics and identifies the former with intrinsic nature, thus\ndiscriminating \u201clevels in the apprehension or discernment of\ndharmas that serve to clarify the ambiguity encountered in\nthe application of the term svabh\u0101va to both individual\ndharmas and to categorial groups\u201d (Cox 2004A, 575). The\ndifference between the analytical description of dharmas in\nterms of their intrinsic nature or their characteristics, notes Cox\n(ibid, 576), is that \u201cwhereas intrinsic nature acquires\nits special significance in the context of exegetical categorization,\nthe starting point for the characteristics lies in perspectivistic\ncognition. Ontology is a concern for both systems, but the shift in\nterminology from intrinsic nature to the characteristics reflects a\nconcurrent shift from a category-based abstract ontology to an\nepistemological ontology that is experientially or cognitively\ndetermined.\u201d This new epistemological emphasis looms in through\na modified definition of existence proposed by the mature\nSarv\u0101stiv\u0101da exegesis that sees the causal efficacy\nunderlying all existence as cognitive. Representing this development\nin the history of Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da thought is Sa\u1e45ghabhadra\n(fifth century CE), who states in his\nNy\u0101y\u0101nus\u0101ra: \u201cto be an object-field that\nproduces cognition (buddhi) is the true characteristic of\nexistence\u201d (ibid). This means that dharmas as\nthe constituents of our experiential world are objectively\nidentifiable through cognition.\n\nIn sum, the Abhidharma project, as evident by the dharma\ntheory and its supporting doctrines, is, at bottom, epistemologically\noriented. Yet the project also intends to ascertain that every\nconstituent of the experiential world is knowable and nameable, and\nthat the words and concepts used in the discourse that develops around\nthe discernment of these constituents uniquely define their\ncorresponding referents. The dharma analysis therefore paves\nthe way for conceptual realism: a worldview that is based on the\nnotion of truth as consisting in a correspondence between our concepts\nand statements, on the one hand, and the features of an independent,\ndeterminate reality, on the other hand. Conceptual realism does not\nnecessarily have implications for the ontological status of this\nreality as externally existing. But to espouse such a position is to\nmake a significant move away from the earliest Buddhist teaching that\npresents the Buddha\u2019s view of language as\n conventional.[17]\n",
