    "main_text": "The measurement problem || Extended Wigner\u2019s friend scenarios as a source of no-go theorems\n4.3 Extended Wigner\u2019s friend scenarios as a source of no-go theorems\n\nAs mentioned, quantum theory, as standardly formulated, employs a\ndivision of the world into a part that is treated with the theory, and\na part that is not. Both von Neumann and Heisenberg emphasized an\nelement of arbitrariness in the location of the division. In some\nformulations, the division was thought of as a distinction between\nobserver and observed, and it became common to say that quantum\nmechanics requires reference to an observer for its formulation.\n\nThe founders of quantum mechanics tended to assume implicitly that,\nthough the \u201ccut\u201d is somewhat moveable, in any given\nanalysis a division would be settled on, and one would not attempt to\ncombine distinct choices of the cut in one analysis of an experiment.\nIf, however, one thinks of the cut as marking the distinction between\nobserver and observed, one is led to ask about situations involving\nmultiple observers. Is each observer permitted to treat the other as a\nquantum system?\n \nThe consideration of such scenarios was initiated by Wigner\n(1961).  Wigner considered a hypothetical scenario in which a friend\nconducts an observation, and he himself treats the joint system,\nconsisting of the friend and the system experimented upon, as a\nquantum system. For this reason, scenarios of this sort have come to\nbe known as \u201cWigner\u2019s friend\u201d scenarios.  Wigner was\nled by consideration of such scenarious to hypothesize that conscious\nobservers cannot be in a superposition of states corresponding to\ndistinct perceptions; the introduction of conscious observers\ninitiates a physical collapse of the quantum state; this involves,\naccording to Wigner, \u201ca violation of physical laws where\nconsciousness plays a role\u201d (Wigner 1961, 294 ;167, 181).  \n \nFrauchiger and Renner (2018) initiated the discussion of scenarios\nof this sort involving more than two observers, which have come to be\ncalled \u201cextended Wigner\u2019s friend\u201d scenarios. Further\nresults along these lines include Brukner (2018), Bong et al. (2020),\nand Gu\u00e9rin et al. (2021). The strategy of these investigations\nis to present some set of plausible-seeming assumptions (a different\nset, for each of the works cited), and to show, via consideration of a\nhypothetical situation involving multiple observers, the inconsistency\nof that set of assumptions. The theorems are, therefore, no-go\ntheorems for approaches to the measurement problem that would seek to\nsatisfy all of the members of the set of assumptions that has been\nshown to be inconsistent.\n\nAn assumption common to all of these investigations is that it is\nalways permissible for one observer to treat systems containing other\nobservers within quantum mechanics and to employ unitary evolution for\nthose systems. This means that collapse is not regarded as a physical\nprocess. It is also assumed that each observer always perceives a\nunique outcome for any experiment performed by that observer; this\nexcludes Everettian interpretations. Where the works cited vary is in\nthe other assumptions made.\n\n\nIt should be noted that each of the major avenues of approach to the\nmeasurement problem is capable of giving an account of goings-on in\nany physical scenario, including the ones considered in these works.\nEach of them, therefore, must violate some member of the set of\nassumptions shown to be inconsistent. These results do not pose\nproblems for existing approaches to the measurement problem; rather,\nthey are no-go theorems for approaches that might seek to satisfy all\nof the set of assumptions shown to be inconsistent. As the assumptions\nconsidered include both unitary evolution and unique outcomes of\nexperiments, and the scenarios considered involved situations\ninvolving superpositions of distinct experimental outcomes, these\nresults concern theories on which the quantum state, as given by the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation, is not a complete description of reality,\nas it fails to determine the unique outcomes perceived by the\nobservers. These preceptions could be thought of as supervening on\nbrain states, in which case there is physical structure not included\nin the quantum state, or as attributes of immaterial minds. On either\ninterpretation, the sorts of theories ruled out fall under the first\nhorn of Bell\u2019s dilemma, mentioned in section 4.2, and these\nno-go results in part reproduce, and in part extend, no-go results for\ncertain sorts of modal interpretations (see entry on\n modal interpretations of quantum mechanics).\n\nThese results involving extended Wigner\u2019s friend scenarios have engendered\nconsiderable philosophical discussion; see Sudbery (2017, 2019),\nHealey (2018, 2020), Dieks (2019), Losada et al. (2019), Dascal\n(2020), Evans (2020), Fortin and Lombardi (2020), Kastner (2020),\nMuci\u00f1o & Okon (2020), Bub (2020, 2021), Cavalcanti (2021),\nCavalcanti and Wiseman (2021), and \u017bukowski and Markiewicz\n(2021).\n",
