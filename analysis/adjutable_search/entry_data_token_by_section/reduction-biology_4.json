    "main_text": "Models of (Epistemic) Reduction || Explanatory Reduction\n3.2 Explanatory Reduction\n\nA variety of explanatory reasoning patterns used by life scientists\nare now under scrutiny in philosophy of biology and theory reduction\nis no longer the primary focus. Various models of explanatory\nreduction focus on reductive explanation and differ from theory\nreduction (which is also a kind of explanation on the\ndeductive-nomological notion of explanation) in two important\nways:\n\n(a) Whereas theory reduction assumes that reduction is a relation\nbetween theories, models of explanatory reduction permit other\nfeatures as the relata of a reductive explanation, such as fragments\nof a theory, generalizations of varying scope, mechanisms, and even\nindividual facts. One approach pursued along these lines is due to\nKenneth Waters (1990, 1994, 2000). Instead of construing theory\nrelations in terms of the Nagel-Schaffner model, he identifies a key\nprinciple of inference operating in classical genetics and molecular\ngenetics: the \u201cdifference making principle\u201d (gene\ndifferences cause differences in phenotypes). This principle can be\nascribed to\n genes\n in both classical and molecular genetics. An explanatory reduction is\nachieved between them because their causal roles correspond. Waters\n(2008) extends this account by emphasizing how the investigative\npractices of classical genetics were \u201cretooled\u201d by\ndevelopments in molecular genetics, which accounts for the success of\nthe corresponding explanations.\n\nAnother example of explanatory reduction is due to Marcel Weber\n(2005). In line with models of theory reduction, Weber maintains that\nbiochemical (\u201cphysico-chemical\u201d) laws carry the\nexplanatory force, but that a fact or basic generality about\nbiological mechanisms (rather than a genuine law or a whole theory),\nsuch as the mechanism of action potentials in neurotransmission, is\nwhat is explained. By permitting reference to higher level structures\nin the explanans, such as axons, he does not require that a\nreductive explanation contain exclusively biochemical expressions.\n\n(b) A characteristic difference between theory reduction and\nexplanatory reduction stems from the fact that the\nformer\u2014focusing on the epistemic notion of logical\ndeduction\u2014does not incorporate the historically ubiquitous\nontological idea that a reduction explains the whole in terms of its\nparts (see, e.g., Winther 2011). Models of explanatory reduction\ntypically assume that reductive explanation is\n causal explanation,\n where a higher level feature is explained by the interaction of\nconstituent parts. Stuart Kauffman (1971) gave an early expression of\nthe idea that the search for explanations in experimental biology\nproceeds by decomposing an overall system into interacting parts.\nWimsatt (1976b) also recognized that this mapped more naturally onto\nthe language of biologists, especially the practice of discovering and\nelucidating mechanisms (see also Bechtel and Richardson 1993).\nMechanism approaches have now developed into a robust alternative to\ntheory reduction (see\n Section 5).\n Since many philosophers of biology and neuroscience conceive of\nexplanation as the description of\n mechanisms,\n accounts of explanatory reduction can rely on the notion of a\nmechanistic explanation (e.g., Delehanty 2005).\n\nModels of explanatory reduction avoid several problems facing theory\nreduction (see\n Section 3.1).\n Since explanatory reduction is not committed to the relata of an\nexplanation being theories involving laws, it can defend the\npossibility of reduction without formally reconstructing a clearly\ndelineated theory of molecular biology or classical genetics. Its\nfocus on reduction as explanation of a whole in terms of its parts\ncaptures a feature of actual molecular explanations. Whereas accounts\nof theory reduction have to acknowledge that reduction (in this sense)\nhas not yet been achieved and must appeal to its \u201cin\nprinciple\u201d possibility, accounts of explanatory reduction\ncomport well with the piecemeal nature of actual scientific research.\nExperimental and molecular biology can offer reductive explanations\neven if many facts remain unexplained and existing explanations still\nrequire more details to be filled in. Current biology effectively\nexplains individual facts and generalities of smaller scope, and the\nexplanans can be a mere fragment of a theory (see, e.g.,\nSchaffner 2006 on \u201cpatchy and fragmentary\u201d reductions).\nFinally, given that mechanistic explanations in experimental biology\nare preceded by and closely tied to the discovery of mechanisms\n(Craver and Darden 2013), explanatory reduction provides an account of\nreduction that can be related to scientific discovery, while\napproaches of theory reduction have to separate the context of\njustification (reduction and explanation) from the context of\ndiscovery.\n\nAn early model of explanatory reduction due to William Wimsatt (1976b)\nassumes that reduction is the causal explanation of an individual\nevent (rather than a generality), involving a\n\u201ccompositional redescription\u201d of a higher level state of\naffairs into some of its component features. This model is related to\nWesley Salmon\u2019s (1971) account of statistical explanation, which\nuses the notion of\n screening off\n to explicate the idea of one property being statistically more\nrelevant (and thus more explanatory) than another one. Wimsatt\nreplaces Salmon\u2019s statistical relevance with the idea of causal\nrelevance (as explanatory reduction in biology involves the search for\ncausally relevant factors), and he develops the notion of\n\u201ceffective screening off\u201d. Compositional redescription and\nexplanation in terms of lower level properties can have a greater\n\u201ccost\u201d of explanation (e.g., by being more complicated)\nthan the description in terms of the higher level property that is\neffectively screened off. A consequence of the epistemic\n\u201ccost\u201d requirement is that an explanatory reduction that\neffectively screens off a described higher level feature does not make\nit irrelevant and thus eliminable (as in Salmon\u2019s account)\nbecause it can be retained for pragmatic purposes.\n\n Sahotra\n Sarkar\u2019s (1998) detailed discussion of reductionism and\ngenetics offers several relevant conceptual clarifications. Focusing\non substantive issues about reduction in genetics (especially\nrepresentation, see\n Section 4.3),\n rather than formal considerations in a theory of reduction, Sarkar\ndevelops a view of explanatory reduction that is not committed to a\nparticular account of explanation. Two such basic types of reduction\nare \u201cabstract hierarchical reduction\u201d and \u201cstrong\nreduction\u201d (or spatial hierarchical reduction), where the\nlatter\u2014unlike abstract hierarchical reduction\u2014requires\nthat entities of a lower hierarchical level are physical parts of\nhigher level entities. (Each type of reduction can come in stronger\nand weaker forms as different kinds of approximations are involved in\ndifferent explanations.) Sarkar argues that explanations in\nclassical genetics, which explain phenotypic patterns in\nterms of classical genes, are abstract hierarchical reductions. The\nentities involved in this case are alleles, loci, linkage groups,\ngenotypes, and phenotypes, which stand in hierarchical relations\n(e.g., alleles \\(A\\) and \\(a\\) form genotype \\(Aa)\\), with individual\nalleles occupying the lowest level. However, this is an abstract\nrather than a spatial hierarchy; the assumption that \\(A\\) and \\(a\\)\nmap to \\(Aa\\) at the next higher level does not require \\(Aa\\) to be a\nphysical entity that has \\(A\\) and \\(a\\) as its spatial\nparts. Furthermore, the genotypic entities in this hierarchy are\ngoverned by various transformations and regularities (principles of\ninheritance), such as segregation, linkage, and mutation, which help\nto explain phenotypic patterns of inheritance. Although this abstract\nhierarchy can be interpreted as a spatial hierarchy by viewing\nclassical genes as being parts of chromosomes, Sarkar\u2019s point is\nthat the various practices in classical genetics, such as segregation\nand linkage analysis, did not require a physical interpretation of\ngenetic maps, and that explanations in terms of an abstract hierarchy\ncan be genuine reductions since they invoke a lower and thus more\nfundamental hierarchical level.\n\nRegarding spatial hierarchical reduction, Sarkar argues that this\nregularly occurs in molecular biology, where certain cellular\nfeatures are explained by macromolecular physics. The various\ncomponents of cells form nested part-whole relations, resulting in a\nspatial hierarchy. Many mechanisms of classical genetics can be\nreductively explained by the physical principles governing the\nbehavior of macromolecules (though approximations are still\nnecessary). Explanatorily relevant principles for the physics of\nmacromolecules include weak interactions, hydrogen bonding,\nhydrophobic bonding, allosteric transformations, lock-key fit, and the\nidea that structure determines function. Sarkar\u2019s central tenet\nis that the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of replication,\nrecombination, and cell division provide reductive explanations of the\nprinciples of classical genetics. Even though classical genetics\noffered an account of gene transmission and could rely on cytological\nexplanations, these accounts did not yield a complete explanation of\nhow and why recombination occurs. Molecular biology filled in this gap\nand corrected classical genetics.\n\nOther models of explanatory reduction have been put forward by\nphilosophers, many with an explicit eye to capturing how reduction\noccurs in scientific practice (e.g., Bickle 2003, 2006, 2008). In some\nways the most unique defense of explanatory reduction is found in the\nwork of Alex Rosenberg (2006), which departs from his earlier critical\nfocus on theory reduction (1978, 1985, 1994). First, according to his\nposition, strict laws (universal, exceptionless, spatio-temporally\nunrestricted) are required for explanation and the only candidate law\nin biology is the principle of natural selection (PNS). Second,\nwhy-necessary explanations are better than how-possible explanations\nin historical sciences such as biology, but why-necessary explanations\nare only available at the molecular level because structure becomes\ndecoupled from function above this level. Therefore, all how-possible\nexplanations in \u201cfunctional biology\u201d (i.e., non-molecular\nbiology), even those invoking the PNS, and any descriptions from\nfunctional biology involving higher levels of organization get\nexplained (why-necessarily) by the PNS operating on the molecular\nlevel (often occurring at some relatively distant point in\nevolutionary\n history).[6]\n\nMarie Kaiser (2011, 2015) has offered a thorough analysis of reductive\nexplanation, including a systematic treatment of metaphilosophical\nissues that underlie different approaches (see 2015, Chapter 2).\nInstead of arguing for or against reduction, she both articulates the\nadvantages of an explanation being reductive and indicates that many\nbiological phenomena cannot be explained in this way. On\nKaiser\u2019s account, an explanation is reductive if it has three\ncharacteristics: (1) lower-level, (2) internal, and (3)\nparts-in-isolation. \u201cLower-level\u201d means that the\nexplanation relies only on features that are at a lower level than the\nphenomenon being explained. Similar to Sarkar\u2019s hierarchical\naccount, a reduction does not have to be a molecular or lowest-level\nexplanation because Kaiser wants to capture reductive explanations\nthroughout biology, including ecology. Explanations with this\ncharacteristic provide an epistemically important unidirectional\n\u201cflow\u201d of explanation from the lower to the higher level,\neven if some of the relevant lower-level entities are not spatial\nparts of the explanandum phenomenon. However, Kaiser also\nrequires that reductive explanations appeal only to physical parts\n(\u201cinternal\u201d) of the explanandum phenomenon or\nsystem. Additionally, to fully qualify as reductive, an explanation\nmust represent each part it invokes in isolation\u2014not in\nisolation from any context, but rather in isolation from a\npart\u2019s original complex context. This\n\u201cparts-in-isolation\u201d characteristic is associated with a\nsystem being near-decomposable; upon decomposition, the actual\nfunctioning of a part can be understood in isolation. The whole\nsystem\u2019s operation then can be recomposed from the parts\ninteracting in a largely sequential and linear fashion (Bechtel and\nRichardson 1993, Bechtel and Abrahamsen 2009). Using these three\ncharacteristics, one can classify different explanations and\ndistinguish a reductive explanation from a mechanistic explanation or\nfrom a part-whole explanation (Kaiser 2015, ch. 6).\n",
