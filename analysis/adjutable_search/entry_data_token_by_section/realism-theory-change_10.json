    "main_text": "Scientific Realism and the Pessimistic Induction || Structural Realism\n2.7 Structural Realism\n\nAn instance of the divide et impera strategy is structural\nrealism. This view has been associated with John Worrall (1989), who\nrevived the relationist account of theory-change that emerged in the\nbeginning of the twentieth century. In opposition to scientific\nrealism, structural realism restricts the cognitive content of\nscientific theories to their mathematical structure together with\ntheir empirical consequences. But, in opposition to instrumentalism,\nstructural realism suggests that the mathematical structure of a\ntheory represents the structure of the world (real relations between\nthings). Against PI, structural realism contends that there is\ncontinuity in theory-change, but this continuity is (again) at the\nlevel of mathematical structure. Hence, the \u2018carried over\u2019\nmathematical structure of the theory correctly represents the\nstructure of the world and this best explains the predictive success\nof a\n theory.[8]\n\nStructural realism was independently developed in the 1970s by Grover\nMaxwell (1970a, 1970b) in an attempt to show that the Ramsey-sentence\napproach to theories need not lead to instrumentalism.\nRamsey-sentences go back to a seminal idea by Frank Ramsey (1929). To\nget the Ramsey-sentence \\(^{R}T\\) of a (finitely axiomatisable) theory\nT we conjoin the axioms of T in a single sentence,\nreplace all theoretical predicates with distinct variables \\(u_i\\),\nand bind these variables by placing an equal number of existential\nquantifiers \\(\\exists u_i\\) in front of the resulting formula. Suppose\nthat the theory T is represented as T\n(\\(t_1\\),\u2026, \\(t_n\\); \\(o_1\\),\u2026, \\(o_m\\)), where\nT is a purely logical \\(m+n\\)-predicate. The Ramsey-sentence\n\\(^{R}T\\) of T is: \n\n\\[\\exists u_1 \\exists u_2\\ldots \\exists u_{n} T (u_1,\\ldots ,u_{n}; o_1,\\ldots,o_{m}).\\]\n\n\nThe Ramsey-sentence \\(^{R}T\\) that replaces theory T has\nexactly the same observational consequences as T; it can play\nthe same role as T in reasoning; it is truth-evaluable if\nthere are entities that satisfy it; but since it dispenses altogether\nwith theoretical vocabulary and refers to whatever entities satisfy it\nonly by means of quantifiers, it was taken to remove the issue of the\nreference of theoretical terms/predicates. \u2018Structural\nrealism\u2019 was suggested to be the view that: i) scientific\ntheories issue in existential commitments to unobservable entities and\nii) all non-observational knowledge of unobservables is structural\nknowledge, i.e., knowledge not of their first-order (or\nintrinsic) properties, but rather of their higher-order (or\nstructural) properties. The key idea here was that a Ramsey-sentence\nsatisfies both conditions (i) and (ii). So we might say that, if true,\nthe Ramsey-sentence \\(^{R}T\\) gives us knowledge of the structure of\nthe world: there is a certain structure which satisfies the\nRamsey-sentence and the structure of the world (or of the relevant\nworldly domain) is isomorphic to this structure.\n\nThough initially Worrall\u2019s version of structural realism was\ndifferent from Maxwell\u2019s, being focused on\u2014and motivated\nby\u2014Poincar\u00e9\u2019s argument for structural\ncontinuity in theory-change, in later work Worrall came to adopt the\nRamsey-sentence version of structural realism (see appendix IV of\nZahar 2001).\n\nA key problem with Ramsey-sentence realism is that though a\nRamsey-sentence of a theory may be empirically inadequate, and hence\nfalse, if it is empirically adequate (if, that is, the\nstructure of observable phenomena is embedded in one of its models),\nthen it is bound to be true. For, as Max Newman (1928) first noted in\nrelation to Russell\u2019s (1927) structuralism, given some\ncardinality constraints, it is guaranteed that there is an\ninterpretation of the variables of \\(^{R}T\\) in the theory\u2019s\nintended\n domain.[9]\n\nMore recently, David Papineau (2010) has argued that if we identify\nthe theory with its Ramsey-sentence, it can be argued that past\ntheories are approximately true if there are entities which satisfy,\nor nearly satisfy, their Ramsey-sentences. The advantage of this move,\naccording to Papineau, is that the issue of referential failure is\nbypassed when assessing theories for approximate truth, since the\nRamsey sentence replaces the theoretical terms with existentially\nbound variables. But as Papineau (2010: 381) admits, the force of the\nhistorical challenge to realism is not thereby thwarted. For it may\nwell be the case that the Ramsey-sentences of most past theories are\nnot satisfied (not even nearly\n so).[10]\n",
