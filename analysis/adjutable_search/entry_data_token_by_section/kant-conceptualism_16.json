    "main_text": "Points of Dispute || Imagination, Perception, and Images\n5.7 Imagination, Perception, and Images\n\nKant famously describes the imagination (Einbildungskraft) as\na necessary ingredient of perception itself (A120n). This claim has\nplayed an important role in several contemporary interpretations of\nKant\u2019s theory of experience, in both his sense (Young 1988,\n1992; Makkreel 1990; Gibbons 2002; Kneller 2007; Horstmann 2018;\nTolley 2019) and in our modern English sense (see Strawson 1970;\nSellars 1978; Matherne 2015).\n\nThere are at least three important questions regarding the Imagination\nthat are of particular note with respect to the debate between\nIntellectualism and Sensibilism. First, how imagination is to be\nunderstood as a faculty\u2014i.e., as spontaneous or receptive, as\nsensory or intellectual (Hanna 2008: 62). Second, whether imaginative\nactivity is a form of mental activity that does not require synthesis\nin the \u201cpart-to-whole\u201d sense (see especially Waxman 1991,\n2014; Land 2014; Williams 2018). Third, whether the role of\nimagination in the formation of images, and the necessary role of such\nimage formation in cognition (A121) indicates a way in which an\nIntellectualist conception of perception (as opposed to\nintuition) might find a plausible footing (Matherne 2015; Gomes 2017a;\nStephenson 2017; Tolley 2019).\n\nDiscussion of imagination\u2019s role in perception (in Kant\u2019s\nsense) and image formation is an area which could stand further\nattention. In particular, it seems clear that Kant conceives of images\nas, in some sense, sensory representations. But what kind of sensory\nrepresentations? Are they intuitions? If so, how do images differ from\n\u2018immediately given\u2019 intuitions? If, as Kant sometimes\nsuggests (e.g., A120-1), image formation is a necessary intermediate\nstage between given sensory states and constructed intellectual\nstates, how might the structure or content of an image possess\nfeatures that make it more than a \u201cmere\u201d sensory state,\nwhile being nevertheless different from judgment (Tracz 2020)?\nMoreover, in what sense does image formation require a\n\u201cschema\u201d and in what sense does such schematization\npresent an intermediary between the sensible and the intellectual?\nKant\u2019s notion of a schema is itself much contested, but it seems\nclearly relevant to the case of perception (Longuenesse 2000;\nGr\u00fcne 2009; Dunlop 2012; Williams 2012; Matherne 2015; Tolley\n2019).\n",
