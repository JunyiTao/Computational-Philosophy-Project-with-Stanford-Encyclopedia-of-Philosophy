The Case of R\u016bm\u012b\n\nMu\u1e25ammad Jal\u0101l al-D\u012bn Balkh\u012b, better known as\n\u201cR\u016bm\u012b,\u201d is regarded by many to be one of the\ngreatest Sufi poets of the Islamic tradition. In his magnum opus,\nMathnaw\u012b, which has been called by some\n\u201cThe Persian Qur\u2018an,\u201d R\u016bm\u012b scorns\ndiscursive thought and ridicules philosophers for walking on wobbly\nstilts:\n\nRationalists\u2019 legs are just like stilts;\n\nHow unfixed and stolid are feet of wood! (Nicholson, I: 2127)\n\n\nNevertheless, he became an influential figure in the tradition of\npost-Avicennian philosophical Sufism.\n\nR\u016bm\u012b\u2019s critique of Peripatetic philosophy is closer to\nGhazz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s critique of rationalism than an outright\nrejection of it. Advocating \u201cepistemological humility,\u201d\nR\u016bm\u012b offers a critique of such traditional epistemological\ntheories as truth by correspondence, authority, and reasoning while\nallowing for a more experiential aspect of truth.\n\nIn his Mathnaw\u012b, R\u016bm\u012b criticizes the\nreliability of truth claims based on sensory perception as well:\n\nAll the senses of man are impermanent\n\nFor in the presence of the light of the Day of Resurrection\nthey\u2019re naught.\n\nThe light of the senses and spirits of our fathers\n\nIs not totally evanescent and naught like plants (Nicholson, IV:\n431\u201333)\n\n\nWhile the senses provide us with some knowledge, it is not a type of\nknowledge that can lead to the discovery of spiritual and existential\ntruth.\n\nR\u016bm\u012b also rejects the idea of \u201ctruth by\nauthority\u201d and alludes to the dangers of blindly following those\nwho claim to know the truth. His critique is particularly aimed at\nMuslim jurists who adhere to the Divine command theory.\n\nA myriad servile conformists who follow conjecture\n\nAre cast down into the lowest depths, struck by scruples.\n\nFor the speculative following of precedent and logical supposition\n\nIs their foundation and the very feather and wing of their flight.\n\nTheir inner devil arouses doubts and specious arguments in them\n\nTill benightedly they plummet headlong down like blind folk\n(Nicholson, IV: 2125\u201327)\n\n\nAs to the application of reason, which is at the heart of\nphilosophical enterprise, R\u016bm\u012b divides the intellect into\nuniversal intellect (\u2018aql-i kull\u012b) and particular\nintellect (\u2018aql-i juz\u2019\u012b). Whereas the\nuniversal\u00a0intellect attends to the affairs of the Divine realm,\nthe particular intellect\u2019s scope is restricted to this world. In\nresponse to the Muslim rationalists (Mu\u2018tazilites),\nR\u016bm\u012b states:\n\nThe difference among intellects was intrinsic in origin \u2013\n\nYou should hear the doctrine according to the traditionalists\n\n\u2014Contrary to the opinion of the Mu\u2018tazilites,\n\nWho maintain all intellects in their origin were basically equal,\n\nBut by experience and learning, minds increase or decrease\n\nSo one is made more knowledgeable than the other one \u2013\n\nTheir doctrine is false because even a boy\u2019s counsel\n\nWho has no experience in any course of action\n\n\u2014From that young child a thought will spring up\n\nWhich a wise old sage with manifold experience has no inkling\n(Nicholson, III: 1539\u201343)\n\n\nAnd again R\u016bm\u012b asserts:\n\nThe animal man who by deceit and cunning knows\u2026\n\nThe intricacies of the science of geometry\n\nOr astronomy, medicine and philosophy\n\nWhich are concerned with this world\n\nIs barred from finding the way to seventh heaven.\n\nAll those sciences are fit for building a stable;\n\nThey serve as columns for the abode of camels and cows.\n\nTheir purpose is but to let the animal survive a day or two\n\nAnd yet these imbeciles call those sciences \u201cmysteries\u201d\n(Nicholson, IV: 1519\u20131516)\n\n\nHaving criticized theories of truth by correspondence, authority, and\nreasoning, R\u016bm\u012b advocates a more existential understanding\nof truth which he, along with many Islamic Philosophers, refer to as\nthe universal intellect. He tells us:\n\nThe other intellect is a gift from God,\n\nWhose source is like a spring within the soul.\n\nWhen the water of knowledge gushes forth from the heart,\n\nIt neither becomes fetid, grows old nor wilts.\n\nIf its path where it flows is blocked, why worry?\n\nFor like a spring it gushes forth from the house constantly.\n\nThe acquired intellect is like a water sluice\n\nRunning down into houses from the hills;\n\nIf the path of water is obstructed, it\u2019s undone:\n\nSeek the spring from within yourself (Nicholson, IV: 1964\u201368)\n\n\nPhilosophers\u2019 reliance on reason alone clashes with the validity\nof knowledge by intuition and divine revelation according to\nR\u016bm\u012b:\n\nThe philosopher through thought and surmise is in denial \u2013\n\nTell him go and smash his head against this wall.\n\nThe language of water, of earth and mire\n\nIs comprehensible to the senses of the heart\u2019s adepts.\n\nThe philosopher who is sceptical about the moaning\n pillar[1]\n\nIs himself estranged from the senses of the sages.\n\nSuch things are, he says, but a reflection of melancholic passions\n\nWhich generate these wild fantasies in people\u2019s heads\n(Nicholson, I: 3278\u201381)\n\n\nWhere R\u016bm\u012b and some philosophers agree upon is the existence\nof the very faculty of intuition, which is often associated with the\nuniversal intellect. According to R\u016bm\u012b, this faculty, which\nmust be \u2018awakened\u2019 by practicing the arduous process of\nthe mystical path, leads to the awakening of the five internal\nspiritual senses that complement the five external\nphysical senses. All the ten senses are controlled by the symbolic\n\u201cheart\u201d\u2014the organ of supersensory perception.\n\n\nThere are five [spiritual] senses besides these five [physical] senses\n\nThe former are like red gold and the latter like copper.\n\nIn the marketplace where the expert connoisseurs are busy\n\nHow should the copper and golden senses be priced the same?\n\nThe physical senses\u2019 nutriment is murky and tenebrous;\n\nThe spiritual sense sups and dines on the sun (Nicholson, II:\n49\u201351)\n\nBe silent, be silent, drink silently.\n\nVeil yourself, veil yourself for you are the hidden treasure.\n\nSpeak not, speak not of this exposition of my heart\n\nSo you be not bewildered, so you do not remain perplexed\n\n(Kulliy\u0101t-i Shams, vol. 2, ghazal 637, vv. 6649,\n6653)\n\n\nR\u016bm\u012b\u2019s impact on Islamic philosophy can be seen in\nvarious commentaries on philosophical gnosticism that were influenced\nby R\u016bm\u012b\u2019s works. The tradition of writing commentaries\nor quoting R\u016bm\u012b, which appears in the works of Mull\u0101\n\u1e62adr\u0101, L\u0101hij\u012b, and Sabziw\u0101r\u012b continues\nwell into the modern era.\n",
