    "main_text": "Quantum Observables\n10. Quantum Observables\n\nOrthodox quantum theory supplies us with probabilities not merely for\npositions but for a huge class of quantum observables. It might thus\nappear that it is a much richer theory than Bohmian mechanics, which\nseems exclusively concerned with positions. Appearances are, however,\nmisleading. In this regard, as with so much else in the foundations of\nquantum mechanics, Bell made the crucial observation: \n\n\n[I]n physics the only observations we must consider are position\nobservations, if only the positions of instrument pointers. It is a\ngreat merit of the de Broglie-Bohm picture to force us to consider\nthis fact. If you make axioms, rather than definitions and theorems,\nabout the \u201cmeasurement\u201d of anything else, then you commit\nredundancy and risk inconsistency. (Bell 1982, reprinted 1987c: 166)\n\n\n\nConsider classical mechanics first. The observables are functions on\nphase space, functions of the positions and momenta of the particles.\nThe axioms governing the behavior of the basic\nobservables\u2014Newton\u2019s equations for the positions or\nHamilton\u2019s for positions and momenta\u2014define the theory.\nWhat would be the point of making additional axioms, for other\nobservables? After all, the behavior of the basic observables entirely\ndetermines the behavior of any observable. For example, for classical\nmechanics, the principle of the conservation of energy is a theorem,\nnot an axiom. \n\nThe situation might seem to differ in quantum mechanics, as usually\nconstrued. Here there is no small set of basic observables having the\nproperty that all other observables are functions of them. Moreover,\nno observables at all are taken seriously as describing objective\nproperties, as actually having values whether or not they are or have\nbeen measured. Rather, all talk of observables in quantum mechanics is\nsupposed to be understood as talk about the measurement of the\nobservables.\n\nBut if this is so, the situation with regard to other observables in\nquantum mechanics is not really that different from that in classical\nmechanics. Whatever quantum mechanics means by the measurement of (the\nvalues of) observables\u2014that, we are urged to believe,\ndon\u2019t actually have values\u2014must at least refer to some\nexperiment involving interaction between the \u201cmeasured\u201d\nsystem and a \u201cmeasuring\u201d apparatus leading to a\nrecognizable result, as given potentially by, say, a pointer\norientation. But then if some axioms suffice for the behavior of\npointer orientations (at least when they are observed), rules about\nthe measurement of other observables must be theorems, following from\nthose axioms, not additional axioms.\n\nIt should be clear from the discussion\n towards the end of Section 4\n and at the\n beginning of Section 9\n that, assuming the quantum equilibrium hypothesis, any analysis of\nthe measurement of a quantum observable for orthodox quantum\ntheory\u2014whatever it is taken to mean and however the\ncorresponding experiment is performed\u2014provides ipso facto at\nleast as adequate an account for Bohmian mechanics. The only part of\northodox quantum theory relevant to the analysis is the\nSchr\u00f6dinger evolution, and it shares this with Bohmian\nmechanics. The main difference between them is that orthodox quantum\ntheory encounters\n the measurement problem\n before it reaches a satisfactory conclusion while Bohmian mechanics\ndoes not. This difference stems of course from what Bohmian mechanics\nadds to orthodox quantum theory: actual configurations.\n\nThe rest of this section will discuss the significance of quantum\nobservables for Bohmian mechanics. (It follows from what has been said\nin the three preceding paragraphs that what we conclude here about\nquantum observables for Bohmian mechanics holds for orthodox quantum\ntheory as well.)\n\nBohmian mechanics yields a natural association between experiments and\nso-called generalized observables, given by\npositive-operator-valued measures (Davies 1976), or POVMs, \\(O(dz)\\),\non the value spaces for the results of the experiments (Berndl,\nDaumer, et al. 1995). This association is such that the probability\ndistribution of the result \\(Z\\) of an experiment, when performed upon\na system with wave function \\(\\psi\\), is given by \\(\\langle \\psi |\nO(dz)\\psi \\rangle\\) (where \\(\\langle | \\rangle\\) is the usual\n inner product\n between quantum state vectors).\n\nMoreover, this conclusion follows immediately from the very meaning\nof an experiment from a Bohmian perspective: a coupling of system to\napparatus leading to a result \\(Z\\) that is a function of the final\nconfiguration of the total system, e.g., the orientation of a pointer.\nAnalyzed in Bohmian mechanical terms, the experiment defines a map\nfrom the initial wave function of the system to the distribution of\nthe result. It follows directly from the structure of Bohmian\nmechanics, and from the fact that the quantum equilibrium distribution\nis quadratic in the wave function, that this map is bilinear (or, more\nprecisely, sesquilinear, in that its dependence on one factor of the\nwave function is antilinear, involving complex conjugation, rather\nthan linear). Such a map is equivalent to a POVM.\n\nThe simplest example of a POVM is a standard quantum observable,\ncorresponding to a self-adjoint operator \\(A\\) on the Hilbert space of\nquantum states (i.e., wave functions). For Bohmian mechanics, more or\nless every \u201cmeasurement-like\u201d experiment is associated\nwith this special kind of POVM. The familiar quantum measurement axiom\nthat the distribution of the result of the \u201cmeasurement of the\nobservable \\(A\\)\u201d is given by the spectral measure for\n\\(A\\) relative to the wave function (in the very simplest cases just\nthe absolute squares of the so-called probability amplitudes)\nis thus obtained.\n\nFor various reasons, after the discovery of quantum mechanics it\nquickly became almost universal to speak of an experiment associated\nwith an operator \\(A\\) in the manner just sketched as a\nmeasurement of the observable \\(A\\)\u2014as if the\noperator somehow corresponded to a property of the system that the\nexperiment in some sense measures. It has been argued that this\nassumption, which has been called naive realism about\noperators, has been a source of considerable confusion about the\nmeaning and implications of quantum theory (Daumer et al. 1997a).\n",
