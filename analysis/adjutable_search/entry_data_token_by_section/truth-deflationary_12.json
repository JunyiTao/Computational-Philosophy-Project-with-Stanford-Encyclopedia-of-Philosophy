    "main_text": "Objections to Deflationism || Truth-Value Gaps\n4.4 Truth-Value Gaps\n\nAccording to some metaethicists\n (moral non-cognitivists\n or expressivists), moral claims \u2013 such as the injunction that\none ought to return people\u2019s phone calls \u2013 are neither\ntrue nor false. The same situation holds, according to some\nphilosophers of language, for claims that presuppose the existence of\nsomething which does not in fact exist, such as the claim that the\npresent King of France is bald; for sentences that are vague, such as\n\u2018These grains of sand constitute a heap\u2019; and for\nsentences that are paradoxical, such as those that arise in connection\nwith the\n Liar Paradox.\n Let us call this thesis the gap, since it finds a gap in the\nclass of sentences between those that are true and those that are\nfalse.\n\nThe deflationary approach to truth has seemed to be inconsistent with\nthe gap, and this has been thought by some (e.g., Dummett 1959 [1978,\n4] and Holton 2000) to be an objection. The reason for the apparent\ninconsistency flows from a natural way to extend the deflationary\napproach from truth to falsity. The most natural thing for a\ndeflationist to do is to introduce a falsity schema like:\n\n(F-sent)\n\u2018\\(p\\)\u2019 is false iff \\({\\sim}p.\\)\n\n\nFollowing Holton (1993, 2000), we consider (F-sent) to be the relevant\nschema for falsity, rather than some propositional schema, since the\nstandard understanding of a gappy sentence is as one that does not\nexpress a proposition (cf. Jackson, et al. 1994).\n\nWith a schema like (F-sent) in hand, deflationists could say things\nabout falsity similar to what they say about truth: (F-sent) exhausts\nthe notion of falsity, there is no substantive property of falsity,\nthe utility of the concept of falsity is just a matter of facilitating\nthe expression of certain generalizations, etc.\n\nHowever, there is a seeming incompatibility between (F-sent) and the\ngap. Suppose, for reductio, that \u2018S\u2019 is a\nsentence that is neither true nor false. In that case, it is not the\ncase that \u2018S\u2019 is true, and it is not the case that\n\u2018S\u2019 is false. But then, by (ES-sent) and (F-sent), we can\ninfer that it is not the case that S, and it is not the case that\nnot-S; in short: \\({\\sim}\\)S and \\({\\sim}{\\sim}\\)S, which is a\nclassical contradiction. Clearly, then, we must give up one of these\nthings. But which one can we give up consistently with\ndeflationism?\n\nIn the context of ethical non-cognitivism, one possible response to\nthe apparent dilemma is to distinguish between a deflationary account\nof truth and a deflationary account of truth-aptitude (cf.\nJackson, et al. 1994). By accepting an inflationary account\nof the latter, one can claim that ethical statements fail the robust\ncriteria of \u201ctruth-aptitude\u201d (reidentified in terms of\nexpression of belief), even if a deflationary view of truth still\nallows the application of the truth predicate to them, via\ninstances of (ES). In the case of\n vagueness,\n one might adopt epistemicism about it and claim that vague sentences\nactually have truth-values, we just can\u2019t know them (cf.\nWilliamson 1994. For an alternative, see Field 1994b).\n\nWith respect to the Liar Paradox, the apparent conflict between\ndeflationism and the gap has led some (e.g., Simmons 1999) to conclude\nthat deflationism is hobbled with respect to dealing with the problem,\nsince most prominent approaches to doing so, stemming from the work of\nSaul Kripke (1975), involve an appeal to truth-value gaps. One\nalternative strategy a deflationist might pursue in attempting to\nresolve the Liar is to offer a non-classical logic. Field 2008 adopts\nthis approach and restricts the law of the excluded middle. JC Beall\n(2002) combines truth-value gaps with Kleene logic (see the entry on\n many-valued Logic)\n and makes use of both weak and strong\n negation.\n Armour-Garb and Beall (2001, 2003) argue that deflationists can and\nshould be\n dialetheists\n and accept that some truthbearers are both true and not true (see\nalso, Woodbridge 2005, 152\u20133, on adopting a\n paraconsistent logic\n that remains \u201cquasi-classical\u201d). By contrast, Armour-Garb\nand Woodbridge (2013, 2015) develop a version of the\n\u201cmeaningless strategy\u201d with respect to the Liar (based on\nGrover 1977), which they claim a deflationist can use to dissolve that\nparadox and semantic pathology more generally, without accepting\ngenuine truth-value gaps or giving up classical logic.\n",
