    "main_text": "The Paradoxes Reconsidered || The Ship of Theseus Paradox\n4.5 The Ship of Theseus Paradox\n\nIn this case, the relativist, as so far understood, may seem to enjoy\nno advantage over the absolutist. The problem is not clearly one of\nreconciling LL with ordinary judgments of identity, and the advantage\nafforded by RI does not seem applicable. Griffin (1977), for example,\nrelying on RI, claims that the original and remodeled ship are the\nsame ship but not the same collection of planks, whereas the\nreassembled ship is the same collection of planks as the original but\nnot the same ship. This simply doesn\u2019t resolve the problem. The\nproblem is that the reassembled and remodeled ships have, prima\nfacie, equal claim to be the original and so the bald claims that\nthe reassembled ship is not\u2014and the remodeled ship is\u2014the\noriginal are unsupported. The problem is that of reconciling the\nintuition that certain small changes (replacement of a single part or\nsmall portion) preserve identity, with the problem illustrated by the\nsandals example of \u00a72.5. It turns out, nevertheless, that the\nproblem \\(is\\) one of dealing with the excesses of LL. To resolve the\nproblem, we need an additional level of relativity. To motivate this\ndevelopment, consider the following abstract counterpart of the\nsandals example:\n\nOn the left there is an object \\(P\\) composed of three parts, \\(P_1,\nP_2\\), and \\(P_3\\). On the right is an exactly similar but\nnon-identical object, \\(Q\\), composed of exactly similar parts, \\(Q_1,\nQ_2\\), and \\(Q_3\\), in exactly the same arrangement. For the sake of\nillustration, we adopt the rule that only replacement of (at most) a\nsingle part by an exactly similar part preserves identity.\nSuppose we now interchange the parts of \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\). We begin by\nreplacing \\(P_1\\) by \\(Q_1\\) in \\(P\\) and replacing \\(Q_1\\) by \\(P_1\\)\nin \\(Q\\), to obtain objects \\(P^1\\) and \\(Q^1\\). So \\(P^1\\) is\ncomposed of parts \\(Q_1,\\) \\(P_2,\\) and \\(P_3\\), and Q\\(^1\\) is\ncomposed of parts \\(P_1,\\) \\(Q_2,\\) and \\(Q_3\\). We then replace\n\\(P_2\\) in \\(P^1\\) by \\(Q_2\\), to obtain \\(P^2\\), and so on. Given our\nsample criterion of identity, and assuming the transitivity of\nidentity, \\(P\\) and \\(P^3\\) are counted the same, as are \\(Q\\) and\n\\(Q^3\\). But this appears to be entirely the wrong result.\nIntuitively, \\(P\\) and \\(Q^3\\) are the same, as are \\(Q\\) and \\(P^3\\).\nFor \\(P\\) and \\(Q^3\\) are composed of exactly the same parts put\ntogether in exactly the same way, and similarly for \\(Q\\) and \\(P^3\\).\nFurthermore, \\(Q_3 (P_3)\\) can be viewed as simply the result of\ntaking \\(P (Q)\\) apart and putting it back together in a\nslightly different location. And this last difference can be\neliminated by switching the locations of \\(P^3\\) and \\(Q^3\\) as a last\nstep in the process.\n\nSuppose, however, that we replace our criterion of identity by the\nfollowing more complicated rule: \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are the same\nrelative to z, if both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) differ from \\(z\\) at\nmost by a single part. (This relation is transitive, and is in fact an\nequivalence relation.) For example, relative to \\(P\\), \\(P,\nP^1, Q^2\\), and \\(Q^3\\) are the same, but \\(Q, Q^1, P^2\\) and \\(P^3\\),\nare not. Of course, replacement by a single part is an artificial\ncriterion of identity. In actual cases, it will be a matter of the\ndegree or kind of deviation from the original (represented by\nthe third parameter, \\(z)\\). The basic idea is that identity through\nchange is not a matter of identity through successive, accumulated\nchanges\u2014that notion conflicts with both intuition (e.g., the\nsandals example) and the Kripkean argument: Through successive changes\nobjects can evolve into other objects. The three-place\nrelation of identity does not satisfy LL and is consistent with the\noutlook of the relativist. Gupta (1980) develops a somewhat similar\nidea in detail. Williamson (1990) suggests a rather different\napproach, but one that, like the above, treats identity through change\nas an equivalence relation that does not satisfy LL.\n",
