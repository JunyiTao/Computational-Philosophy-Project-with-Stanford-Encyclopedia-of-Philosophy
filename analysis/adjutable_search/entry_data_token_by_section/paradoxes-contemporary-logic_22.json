    "main_text": "A glance at present-day investigations || From paradoxes to incompleteness\n6.4 From paradoxes to incompleteness\n\nIn standard metamathematics, an important role for a thorough\nunderstanding of the second incompleteness theorem is played by\nL\u00f6b\u2019s theorem (L\u00f6b 1955). The proof of the\ntheorem is related to Curry\u2019s paradox (see this entry,\nand\n Curry\u2019s Paradox)\n and to an informal argument due to Geach 1955. Furthermore,\nL\u00f6b\u2019s theorem is essential for defining mathematical\nstructures, which are adequate for providing versions of\nself-reference and incompleteness (see the so-called Magari\nalgebras and the modal analysis of formal provability, Boolos\n1993). In the same direction, there are applications of\nBerry\u2019s paradox. For instance, in 1966 Vopenka proved\nthe second incompleteness theorem for the Bernays-G\u00f6del theory of\nsets and classes using a form of the same paradox. Boolos 1989\nexploits a Berry-type argument to prove incompleteness in the form\n\u201cthere is no algorithm whose output contains all true\nstatements of arithmetic and no false ones\u201d without\nappealing to diagonalization. The Berry paradox has been related to\nthe incompleteness phenomena also because of work (going back to the\nsixties and the seventies) in the so-called Kolmogorov complexity and\nalgorithmic information theory. In particular, Chaitin has\nshown in a number of papers how to exploit randomness to prove certain\nlimitations of formal systems (see Chaitin 1995). In connection with\nChaitin\u2019s results, Kritchman and Raz 2011 gives a proof of the\nsecond incompleteness theorem, which is based on an argument\nresembling the surprise-test paradox (see\n epistemic paradoxes).\n In turn, this paradox can be explicitly related to Solovay\u2019s\ncompleteness theorem of provability logic (see Montagna\n1994), and more recently Egr\u00e9 2005, De Voos, Kooj and Verbrugge\n2018 applied provability logic to solving the Knower\u2019s\nparadox. It is worth recalling that \u2013 again on the side of\nepistemic logic \u2013 self-reference is applicable in order to prove\nincompleteness in belief models. Brandenburger and Keisler\n(2006) identified a paradox of self-reference in beliefs in games,\nwhich yields a game-theoretic impossibility theorem akin to\nRussell\u2019s Paradox. An informal version of the paradox is that\nthe following configuration of beliefs is impossible: Ann believes\nthat Bob assumes that Ann believes that Bob\u2019s assumption is\nwrong. This is formalized to show that any belief model of a certain\nkind must have a \u2019hole\u2019. An interpretation of the result\nis that \u201cif the analyst\u2019s tools are available to the\nplayers in a game, then there are statements that the players can\nthink about but cannot assume.\u201d Also, the mere fact of\nparadoxes like this one, with a distinct logical\n\u201cflavour\u201d, but arising out of treatments involving\nepistemic notions, is notable, as it can be regarded as an indication\nfor a direction of work that, hinging upon the many examples already\navailable in the literature, is likely to expand and become systematic\nin the future thanks to the application of formal methods (see also\nthis entry, \u00a76.5 on this). Although not directly connected with\nthe incompleteness phenomenon, there are indeed several accounts of\nantinomies affecting what appear to be sets of apparently legitimate,\nnatural postulates involving certain epistemic notions. Let Leitgeb\n2021 work as an ultimate example of sources of this sort, presenting a\nsolution to the lottery paradox (see Kyburg 1961 and\n epistemic paradoxes)\n that affects principles relating categorical belief to graded belief\n(see also Douven 2021 that contains the former source).\n",
