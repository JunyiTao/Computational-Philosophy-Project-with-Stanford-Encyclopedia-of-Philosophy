    "main_text": "Creation, Eternity, Time and Being\n6. Creation, Eternity, Time and Being\nAs a Christian, Grosseteste believed that God created the world\nwith a beginning; indeed, he thought, as some sketchy arguments in the\nHexa\u00e6meron 1.9.7 indicate, that the beginning of the\nworld could be proved. But his primary contribution to the medieval\ndebate over the beginning of the world was his interpretation and\nrefutation of Aristotle\u2019s arguments in Physics 8 for a\nbeginningless or \u201ceternal\u201d world (see Dales 1986).  In this connection\nGrosseteste was at odds with some of his early thirteenth-century\ncontemporaries, such as Alexander of Hales, who thought that Aristotle did not mean to deny the\nbeginning of the world but only that it had a natural\nbeginning.  Let those who adopt such an interpretation, he writes\nin his Hexaemeron, \u201cnot deceive themselves and pointlessly try\nto make a Catholic of Aristotle, thereby wasting their time and mental\npowers and, in making a Catholic of Aristotle, make heretics of\nthemselves\u201d (Dales and Gieben 1982, 61)\n Grosseteste takes up Aristotle\u2019s arguments for a beginningless\nworld in his  Hexa\u00e6meron and, in greater detail, in the\nclosely related treatise On the Finitude of Movement and Time.\nIn both works he holds that Aristotle was led to propose his erroneous\narguments as a result of a failure to adequately grasp simple\neternity.  Grosseteste is prepared to grant that Aristotle and other\nphilosophers proved that God exists and is unchangeable and\nnon-temporal and that they indeed had some grasp of simple\neternity. Even so, their incomplete understanding of simple eternity\nmeant that they did not really understand what they proved.  This lack\nof understanding was due to a disordering of their affectus or\nwill, rather than of their aspectus or reason. This distinction\nbetween affectus and aspectus, which appears to derive\nfrom Augustine, is characteristic of Grosseteste\u2019s thought (see Smith 2018). According\nto Grosseteste, genuine understanding requires that one\u2019s will or\ndesires be directed away from the sensible world to the unchanging\neternal realm, but Aristotle and the other philosophers, being\npreoccupied with the sensible world, could not achieve true\nunderstanding.\nSimple eternity is God\u2019s eternity, the\nnon-temporal mode of being enjoyed by God.  Like\nAugustine before him in Confessions 12.40, Grosseteste thinks we can speak\nof eternity as before time and of time as after eternity, provided we\nbear in mind that the terms \u201cbefore\u201d and\n\u201cafter\u201d are in this connection employed in non-temporal\nsenses.  According to Grosseteste, if Aristotle had more fully grasped\nsimple eternity he would have realized his arguments for the eternity\nof the world rest on a failure to recognize non-temporal notions of\nbefore and after. Aristotle, he thinks, assumes in two of his\narguments for the eternity of the world that a first movement would have\nto have been preceded by a potentiality for this movement and thus by\ntime. But since, according to Aristotle, time requires movement and a\npotentiality for something can only be exercised through a movement,\nthere follows the absurdity that the first movement would not be the\nfirst movement. Thus time and movement must be without a beginning.\nGrosseteste objects that although the first movement exists after not\nexisting and that there was indeed a potential for that movement before\nit, in this context \u201cwas\u201d and \u201cbefore\u201d\nrefer to the relation of eternity to time and are used in a\nnon-temporal sense. The first movement was preceded by a potentiality\nfor itself, not in time, but in God\u2019s eternity, and the actualization\nof this potentiality involves no movement or change in God. As for\nAristotle\u2019s third argument that there cannot be a first instant, hence\nnor a beginning of time or change, because an instant is a link\nbetween past and future, Grosseteste responds that this conception of\nan instant will appeal only to someone already committed to the\neternity of time and change.\n According to Grosseteste, the notion of eternity is key also to\nunderstanding the nature of time. In his commentary on the\nPhysics he takes Aristotle\u2019s conception of time as a number of\nchange in respect of before and after to be the result of a\nsuperficial discussion, adequate as far as the natural philosopher is\nconcerned but inadequate as an account of time\u2019s true essence, an\ninadequacy, he thinks, Augustine had also seen. But Grosseteste is not\nattracted to what he takes to be Augustine\u2019s subjectivist conception\nof time and instead seeks an account of the true essence of time as an\nobjective phenomenon.\n According to Grosseteste, time is \u201cthe privation of the\nat-once of eternity from the totality of being\u201d (Dales 1963a,\n96).  He means that for there to be time there must be items whose\nexistence does not adhere as a whole, as he puts it, with the\nat-once of eternity, that is, whose existence is not\ninstantaneous.  Eternity, is, as it were, a fixed point subject to a\ncontinuous succession of the adherences of instantaneous bits of the\ntotality of existence, one bit adhering to eternity only continuously\nto be replaced by another; this continuous replacement constitutes the\nflow of time. Grosseteste defines the instant, by which he means the\nnow, as this adherence of being with the at-once of eternity,\nand likewise defines past and future in terms of this adherence. He\nrealizes that his use of tenses in his explanations of these notions\nrenders them ultimately circular, but asks that he not be criticized\n\u201cfor making these differences known in terms, as it were, of\nthemselves, for it does not come to mind, or does not do so easily,\nhow they could otherwise be made known\u201d (Dales 1963a, 98).\n \nGrosseteste\u2019s account of time appears to be closely related to his\nconception of existence, as presented in his commentaries on the\nPosterior Analytics and Physics and in On\nTruth (Rossi 1981, 290\u2013291; Dales 1963a, 7; Baur 1912,\n141; see also Lewis 2009).  Grosseteste holds that a created thing\u2019s\nexistence just is its dependence on God.  Thus, a thing does not\ndepend on God for its existence; its dependence on God is its\nexistence.  Grosseteste appears to equate this relation of dependence\nwith the relation of adherence to the  at-once of eternity\nmentioned in his account of time. He remarks that \u201csomething no\nmore partakes of actual existence except insofar as it adheres to the\nfirst being that is all at once\u201d (Dales 1963a, 96\u201397).  He\ndoes not seem to realize that the relata of the relation of adherence\nin his account of time and of the relation of dependence in his\naccount of being are different: in his account of time it is an\ninstantaneous bit of a thing\u2019s existence that adheres, while\nin his account of existence it is the thing itself that is dependent\nand existence is itself treated as a relation, not as the term of a\nrelation.\n",
