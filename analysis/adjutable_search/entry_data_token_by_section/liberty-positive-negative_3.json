    "main_text": "Two Attempts to Create a Third Way || Positive Liberty as Content-neutral\n3.1 Positive Liberty as Content-neutral\n\nMuch of the more recent work on positive liberty has been motivated by\na dissatisfaction with the ideal of negative liberty combined with an\nawareness of the possible abuses of the positive concept so forcefully\nexposed by Berlin. John Christman (1991, 2005, 2009, 2013), for\nexample, has argued that positive liberty concerns the ways\nin which desires are formed \u2014 whether as a result of rational\nreflection on all the options available, or as a result of pressure,\nmanipulation or ignorance. What it does not regard, he says, is the\ncontent of an individual\u2019s desires. The promotion of\npositive freedom need not therefore involve the claim that there is\nonly one right answer to the question of how a person should live, nor\nneed it allow, or even be compatible with, a society forcing its\nmembers into given patterns of behavior. Take the example of a Muslim\nwoman who claims to espouse the fundamentalist doctrines generally\nfollowed by her family and the community in which she lives. On\nChristman\u2019s account, this person is positively unfree if her\ndesire to conform was somehow oppressively imposed upon her through\nindoctrination, manipulation or deceit. She is positively free, on the\nother hand, if she arrived at her desire to conform while aware of\nother reasonable options and she weighed and assessed these other\noptions rationally. Even if this woman seems to have a preference for\nsubservient behavior, there is nothing necessarily freedom-enhancing\nor freedom-restricting about her having the desires she has, since\nfreedom regards not the content of these desires but their mode of\nformation. On this view, forcing her to do certain things rather than\nothers can never make her more free, and Berlin\u2019s paradox of\npositive freedom would seem to have been avoided.\n\nThis more \u2018procedural\u2019 account of positive liberty allows\nus to point to kinds of internal constraint that seem too fall off the\nradar if we adopt only negative concept. For example, some radical\npolitical theorists believe it can help us to make sense of forms of\noppression and structural injustice that cannot be traced to overt\nacts of prevention or coercion. On the one hand, in agreement with\nBerlin, we should recognize the dangers of that come with promoting\nthe values or interests of a person\u2019s \u2018true self\u2019 in\nopposition to what they manifestly desire. Thus, the procedural\naccount avoids all reference to a \u2018true self\u2019. On the\nother, we should recognize that people\u2019s actual selves\nare inevitably formed in a social context and that their values and\nsenses of identity (for example, in terms of gender or race or\nnationality) are shaped by cultural influences. In this sense, the\nself is \u2018socially constructed\u2019, and this social\nconstruction can itself occur in oppressive ways. The challenge, then,\nis to show how a person\u2019s values can be thus shaped but without\nthe kind of oppressive imposition or manipulation that comes not only\nfrom political coercion but also, more subtly, from practices or\ninstitutions that stigmatize or marginalize certain identities or that\nattach costs to the endorsement of values deviating from acceptable\nnorms, for these kinds of imposition or manipulation can be just\nanother way of promoting a substantive ideal of the self. And this was\nexactly the danger against which Berlin was warning, except that the\ndanger is less visible and can be created unintentionally (Christman\n2013, 2015, 2021; Hirschmann 2003, 2013; Coole 2013).\n\nWhile this theory of positive freedom undoubtedly provides a tool for\ncriticizing the limiting effects of certain practices and institutions\nin contemporary liberal societies, it remains to be seen what kinds of\npolitical action can be pursued in order to promote content-neutral\npositive liberty without encroaching on any individual\u2019s\nrightful sphere of negative liberty. Thus, the potential conflict\nbetween the two ideals of negative and positive freedom might survive\nChristman\u2019s alternative analysis, albeit in a milder form. Even\nif we rule out coercing individuals into specific patterns of\nbehavior, a state interested in promoting content-neutral positive\nliberty might still have considerable space for intervention aimed at\n\u2018public enlightenment\u2019, perhaps subsidizing some kinds of\nactivities (in order to encourage a plurality of genuine options) and\nfinancing such intervention through taxation. Liberals might criticize\nthis kind of intervention on anti-paternalist grounds, objecting that\nsuch measures will require the state to use resources in ways that the\nsupposedly heteronomous individuals, if left to themselves, might have\nchosen to spend in other ways. In other words, even in its\ncontent-neutral form, the ideal of positive freedom might still\nconflict with the liberal idea of respect for persons, one\ninterpretation of which involves viewing individuals from the outside\nand taking their choices at face value. From a liberal point of view,\nthe blindness to internal constraints can be intentional (Carter\n2011a). Some liberals will make an exception to this restriction on\nstate intervention in the case of the education of children, in such a\nway as to provide for the active cultivation of open minds and\nrational reflection. Even here, however, other liberals will object\nthat the right to negative liberty includes the right to decide how\none\u2019s children should be educated.\n\nIs it necessary to refer to internal constraints in order to make\nsense of the phenomena of oppression and structural injustice? Some\nmight contest this view, or say that it is true only up to a point,\nfor there are at least two reasons for thinking that the oppressed are\nlacking in negative liberty. First, while Berlin himself equated\neconomic and social disadvantages with natural disabilities, claiming\nthat neither represented constraints on negative liberty but only on\npersonal abilities, many theorists of negative liberty disagree: if I\nlack the money to buy a jacket from a clothes shop, then any attempt\non my part to carry away the jacket is likely to meet with preventive\nactions or punishment on the part of the shop keeper or the agents of\nthe state. This is a case of interpersonal interference, not merely of\npersonal inability. In the normal circumstances of a market economy,\npurchasing power is indeed a very reliable indicator of how far other\npeople will stop you from doing certain things if you try. It is\ntherefore strongly correlated with degrees of negative freedom (Cohen\n1995, 2011; Waldron 1993; Carter 2007; Grant 2013). Thus, while the\npromotion of content-neutral positive liberty might imply the transfer\nof certain kinds of resources to members of disadvantaged groups, the\nsame might be true of the promotion of negative liberty. Second, the\nnegative concept of freedom can be applied directly to disadvantaged\ngroups as well as to their individual members. Some social structures\nmay be such as to tolerate the liberation of only a limited number of\nmembers of a given group. G.A. Cohen famously focused on the case\nproletarians who can escape their condition by successfully setting up\na business of their own though a mixture of hard work and luck. In\nsuch cases, while each individual member of the disadvantaged group\nmight be negatively free in the sense of being unprevented from\nchoosing the path of liberation, the freedom of the individual is\nconditional on the unfreedom of the majority of the rest of the group,\nsince not all can escape in this way. Each individual member of the\nclass therefore partakes in a form of collective negative unfreedom\n(Cohen 1988, 2006; for discussion see Mason 1996; Hindricks 2008;\nGrant 2013; Schmidt 2020).\n",
