Philosophy of Education\n\nIt is probably fair to say that, around the world, Dewey remains as\nwell know for his educational theories (see\n entry on philosophy of education, section Rousseau, Dewey, and the progressive movement)\n as for his philosophical ones. However, a closer look at\nDewey\u2019s body of work shows how often these theories align. Dewey\nrecognized this, reflecting that his 1916 magnum opus in education,\nDemocracy and Education (DE, MW9) \u201cwas for\nmany years that [work] in which my philosophy, such as it is, was most\nfully expounded\u201d (FAE, LW5: 156). DE argued\nthat philosophy itself could be understood as \u201cthe general\ntheory of education\u201d. In lieu of philosophy\u2019s increasing\ntendencies to become hyper-specialized and technical, he urged a\ngreater investment in the problems affecting everyday life. In effect\nthis was a call to see philosophy from the standpoint of education.\nDewey wrote,\n\n\nEducation offers a vantage ground from which to penetrate to the\nhuman, as distinct from the technical, significance of philosophic\ndiscussions\u2026.The educational point of view enables one to\nenvisage the philosophic problems where they arise and thrive, where\nthey are at home, and where acceptance or rejection makes a difference\nin practice. If we are willing to conceive education as the process of\nforming fundamental dispositions, intellectual and emotional, toward\nnature and fellow-men, philosophy may even be defined as the\ngeneral theory of education. (DE, MW9: 338)\n\n\nDewey was active in education his entire life. Besides high school and\ncollege teaching, he devised curricula, established, reviewed and\nadministered schools and departments of education, participated in\ncollective organizing, consulted and lectured internationally, and\nwrote extensively on many facets of education. He established the\nUniversity of Chicago\u2019s Laboratory School as an experimental\nsite for theories in instrumental logic and psychological\nfunctionalism. This school also became a site for democratic\nexpression by the local community.\n",
