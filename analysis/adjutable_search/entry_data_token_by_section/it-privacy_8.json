This is not only data\nexplicitly entered by the user, but also numerous statistics on user\nbehavior: sites visited, links clicked, search terms entered, etc. Data\nmining can be employed to extract patterns from such data, which can\nthen be used to make decisions about the user. These may only affect\nthe online experience (advertisements shown), but, depending on which\nparties have access to the information, they may also impact the user\nin completely different contexts.\n\nIn particular, big data may be used in profiling the user (Hildebrandt\n2008), creating patterns of typical combinations of user properties,\nwhich can then be used to predict interests and behavior. An innocent\napplication is \u201cyou may also like \u2026\u201d, but,\ndepending on the available data, more sensitive derivations may be\nmade, such as most probable religion or sexual preference. These\nderivations could then in turn lead to inequal treatment or\ndiscrimination.  When a user can be assigned to a particular group,\neven only probabilistically, this may influence the actions taken by\nothers (Taylor, Floridi, & Van der Sloot 2017). For example,\nprofiling could lead to refusal of insurance or a credit card, in\nwhich case profit is the main reason for discrimination. When such\ndecisions are based on profiling, it may be difficult to challenge\nthem or even find out the explanations behind them. Profiling could\nalso be used by organizations or possible future governments that have\ndiscrimination of particular groups on their political agenda, in\norder to find their targets and deny them access to services, or\nworse.\n\nBig data does not only emerge from Internet transactions. Similarly,\ndata may be collected when shopping, when being recorded by\nsurveillance cameras in public or private spaces, or when using\nsmartcard-based public transport payment systems. All these data could\nbe used to profile citizens, and base decisions upon such profiles.\nFor example, shopping data could be used to send information about\nhealthy food habits to particular individuals, but again also for\ndecisions on insurance. According to EU data protection law,\npermission is needed for processing personal data, and they can only\nbe processed for the purpose for which they were obtained. Specific\nchallenges, therefore, are (a) how to obtain permission when the user\ndoes not explicitly engage in a transaction (as in case of\nsurveillance), and (b) how to prevent \u201cfunction creep\u201d,\ni.e. data being used for different purposes after they are collected\n(as may happen for example with DNA databases (Dahl & S\u00e6tnan\n2009).\n\nOne particular concern could emerge from genetics and genomic data\n(Tavani 2004, Bruynseels & van den Hoven, 2015). Like other data, genomics can be used to make predictions, and in particular could predict risks of diseases.\nApart from others having access to detailed user profiles, a\nfundamental question here is whether the individual should know what\nis known about her. In general, users could be said to have a right to\naccess any information stored about them, but in this case, there may\nalso be a right not to know, in particular when knowledge of the data\n(e.g. risks of diseases) would reduce the well-being \u2013 by causing\nfear, for instance \u2013 without enabling treatment. With respect to\nprevious examples, one may not want to know the patterns in one\u2019s own\nshopping behavior either.\n",
