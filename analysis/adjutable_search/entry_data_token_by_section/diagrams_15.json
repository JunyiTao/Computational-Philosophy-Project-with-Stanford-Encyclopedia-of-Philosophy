    "main_text": "Diagrams and Cognition, Applications || Some other Diagrammatic Systems\n5.1 Some other Diagrammatic Systems\n\nIt is worth noting that many mathematicians and philosophers proposed\ndiagrammatic systems, often with a didactic motivation. Some systems,\nlike Lewis Carroll\u2019s in \u201cThe Game of Logic\u201d\n (1896)\n are variants on the proposals of Euler and Venn. Others, like Frege\n (1879),\n used lines rather than plane regions. (For a description of\nFrege\u2019s notation, see the section on Complex Statements and\nGenerality in the entry on\n Gottlob Frege.\n See also Englebretsen\n 1992.)\n Carroll\u2019s system supersedes Venn\u2019s in that the\ncomplements of sets are explicitly represented as regions of the\ndiagram, rather than being left as the background region against which\nthe circles appear. This means that Carroll\u2019s system is able to\ndraw inferences about relations between complements of properties, at\nthe expense of representing some properties as disjoint (i.e.,\nnon-connected) regions. This shift closely mirrors the shift in logic\nfrom subject-predicate argumentation to a function-argument\nrepresentation (Stenning\n 1999).\n\nPeirce, a founder of modern quantified logic, also invented a\ngraphical system, called Existential Graphs, which is logically\nequivalent to predicate logic. Along with Don Robert\u2019s\npioneering work on Existential Graphs and John Sowa\u2019s creative\napplication of Peirce\u2019s graphs, recently a group of diagrammatic\nresearchers provided more diverse approaches to Existential Graphs in\na broader theoretical context (Shin\n 2003).\n \n\nOn a more practical theme, AI researchers, one of whose main concerns\nis the heuristic power of representation systems in addition to their\nexpressive power, have been debating about different forms of\nrepresentation for decades (Sloman\n 1971,\n 1985,\n 1995).\n Hence, they have welcomed discussions of the distinct role of visual\nreasoning and have recently hosted interdisciplinary symposiums on\ndiagrammatic reasoning at AI\n conferences.[11]\n At the same time, realizing that human beings adopt different\nrepresentation forms depending on the kinds of problems they face,\nsome AI researchers and design theorists have practiced\ndomain-specific approaches to bringing in problem-tailored\nrepresentation\n forms.[12]\n\nFor instance, Harel\n (1988)\n invented higraphs to represent system specifications in computer\nscience. This idea has been taken up in industrial applications (e.g.,\nUML, in Booch et al.\n 1998).\n Barker-Plummer & Bailin\n (1997)\n present a case study in developing computers which can carry out the\nkind of analogical reasoning that humans perform when proving certain\nmathematical theorems. More recently, an interesting result has been\npresented by Mateja Jamnik of Alan Bundy\u2019s Mathematical\nReasoning Group at Edinburgh (Jamnik\n 2001).\n Jamnik shows how a semi-automatic formal proof system can perform\nsome of the perceptual inferences which humans find so natural. For\ninstance, that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is\nn squared is easily seen by decomposing an n\n\u00d7 n grid into\n\u201cells\u201d (Jamnik et al.\n 1999).\n\nScholars at the University of Brighton has been carrying out\ninteresting projects both in developing diagrammatic systems and in\napplying visual tools in software development, see the link in the\n Other Internet Resources section.\n\nIt should also be mentioned that scientists such as chemists and\nphysicists also use diagrams in order to perform certain computations.\nFeynman diagrams, for example, are used to perform calculations in\nsub-atomic physics. More recently, formal diagrammatic reasoning has\nbeen developed for quantum theory (Coecke & Kissinger\n 2017).\n In Knot Theory (which has applications in physics, Kauffman\n 1991)\n the three Reidemeister Moves are diagrammatic operations which make\nup a complete calculus for proving knots equivalent. Not surprisingly,\nKnot diagrams have attracted interest from researchers (De Toffoli\n& Giardino\n 2014).\n The crucial role of diagrams and diagrammatic reasoning in the\nabstract mathematics of category theory has also been investigated\n(Halimi\n 2012;\n De Toffoli\n 2017).\n \n",
