    "main_text": "Definitional Skepticism\n2. Definitional Skepticism\n\nNearly everybody agrees there is a distinction between life and\nnon-life, typically understood as a difference in kind rather than one\nof degree. Furthermore, most people involved accept that life is some\nsort of natural kind, rather than a human psychological concept. That\nsaid, a common theme in recent philosophical work has been to express\nskepticism of life definitions as a goal. The literature on the\ndefinition of life is vast, repetitive, and utterly inconclusive.\nPhilosophers have disagreed as to the ultimate source of the lack of\nconsensus, citing unstated assumptions in either the definer\u2019s\napproach or the question itself. Note that many scientists are less\nlikely to be skeptical of the goal of defining life, though also more\nresistant to engaging in the philosophical debate.\nOne skeptical view has arisen from the observation that theoretical\ndefinitions of life presume a theory of life (Cleland and Chyba 2002,\nBenner 2010, Cleland 2019). Although it is not obvious that the authors\nallude to the theory-theory of concepts, described in section 1, a\ncommon analogy is to early chemical theory. According to this analogy,\nearly alchemists likened the alchemists\u2019 Aqua regia\n(\u201croyal water\u201d) and Aqua fortis (\u201cstrong\nwater\u201d). Development of atomic theory revealed, Cleland argues,\nthat the true nature of water was H2O, while the other\n\u2018waters\u2019 were  HNO3 + 3 HCl and\nHNO3, respectively. Cleland advocates avoiding definitions altogether,\nfearing they will blind us to new instances of life, and instead opts\nfor tentative criteria, which she believes avoid the implicit dogma of\neven operational definitions.\nOther authors have pointed out that the explanandum of life is\nitself up for debate (Tsokolov 2009, Mix 2020, Parke 2020). According\nto Emily Parke, some accept life as applying to individuals, whereas\nother definitions apply to collectives first (including entire planets)\nand individuals derivatively. Relatedly, most believe life is some kind\nof entity rather than some kind of relation or process (but see\nNicholson and Dupr\u00e9 2018). Parke also points out that some\ndefinitions seek a material basis, perhaps limiting life\u2019s\nsubstrate to the biochemistry we know on Earth, while others are\nfunctional. Sagan famously worried about biochemical definitions\nbecause they were prone to \u2018Earth Chauvinism\u2019 for\nprivileging our own biochemistry (1970). Other authors take our\nbiochemistry to be independently justified as universal (Pace 2001,\nBenner et al. 2004, but see Bains 2004). Finally, Parke distinguishes\nbetween those that seek clean boundaries and those that accept the\npossibility of a continuum of \u2018lifelikeness.\u2019\nOther authors have advocated a kind of quietism about definitions,\nmaintaining that folk concepts need not match up with scientific ones\n(Machery 2011), any definitions would not change scientific practice\n(Szostak 2012), advocated a radical conceptual rethinking (Mariscal\n& Doolittle 2020), or denied the distinction between life & non-life entirely (Jabr 2013).\nThis last position of eliminativism could be expanded as it helps\nillustrate all other life skeptical positions. Cowie 2009 classifies\neliminativist goals as either linguistic or ontological. Ontological\neliminativists don\u2019t believe the objects they are eliminating\ntruly exist. We\u2019re all eliminativists about something, perhaps\nghosts or fairies. Linguistic/conceptual eliminativists, on the other\nhand are merely suspicious of theoretical terms or concepts, what\nRamsey 2020 calls \u2018category dissolution\u2019 or \u2018conceptual fragmentation.\u2019 In essence, it\u2019s not that\nthere aren\u2019t living things, it\u2019s just that the category life is heterogeneous rather than a natural kind. According to Cowie, one can deny that anything matching our theoretical definition of life\nactually exists in the world while still accepting it as a useful fiction. Conversely, one may think scientific theories about life are fruitless or that the term is too vague and confused to be useful, without doubting life exists. If we accept any of these\nalternatives, we should perhaps avoid ever using the term\n\u2018life\u2019 in isolation and instead reference Metabolic Life and Evolutionary Life and all the other conceptions.\n At play in these various forms of skepticism are several\nunderlying assumptions. Among other disagreements, researchers disagree\nabout what life is, whether it is a natural kind with an essence or a\nhuman construct; they disagree as to the purpose of defining life,\nespecially if it will not change scientific practice; and they disagree\nas to the features of life that are relevant and the ones that are mere\nconsequences. When researchers hold unstated assumptions such as these,\nthey are liable to mistake the source of their disagreement.\n",
