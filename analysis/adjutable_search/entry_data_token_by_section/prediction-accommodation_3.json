    "main_text": "A Predictivist Taxonomy\n4. A Predictivist Taxonomy\n\nGlobal predictivism holds that predictions are always superior to\naccommodations, while local predictivism holds that this only holds in\ncertain cases. Strong predictivism asserts that prediction is\nintrinsically superior to accommodation, whereas weak predictivism\nholds that predictive success is epistemically relevant because it is\nsymptomatic of other features that have epistemic import. The\ndistinction between strong and weak predictivism cross classifies with\nthe distinctions between different types of novelty. For example, one\ncould maintain that temporal predictions are intrinsically superior to\ntemporal accommodations (strong temporal predictivism) or that\ntemporal predictions were symptomatic of some other good-making\nfeature of theories (weak temporal predictivism; Hitchcock and Sober\n2004: 3\u20135). These distinctions will be further illustrated\nbelow.\n",
