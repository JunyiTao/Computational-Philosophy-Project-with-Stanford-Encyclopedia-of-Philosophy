    "main_text": "Major Themes in Fuller\u2019s Philosophy || Feminism and Conversations\n2.3 Feminism and Conversations\n\nMargaret Fuller\u2019s \u201cConversations\u201d in Boston became\nfamous among early American feminists. They commenced in 1839 and\ncontinued until April 1844. Each would last would last thirteen weeks\nin a pre-announced time and place (usually the parlor of her friend\nElizabeth Peabody). The \u201cconversants\u201d paid to\nparticipate\u2014usually ten dollars for the series, about what\nEmerson and other transcendentalists charged for a set of their\nlectures. Most of the Conversations were for women only and had about\ntwenty-five participants. Fuller herself led off each two-hour weekly\nsession with a talk, which the audience were then encouraged to\ndiscuss and question. The women who attended were generally well-read,\nusually Unitarian in practice or background, often wives or relatives\nof male transcendentalists. Fuller conceived of her Conversations as\nessential supplements to the educational opportunities then available\nto middle- and upper-class New England women. These might include\nliterature, classics, and fine arts, simply decorative or recreational\nin purpose. Fuller would lead off with such subjects, but then use\nthem to press her participants to address serious questions about\nwomen\u2019s lives, roles, and purposes. She was applying a\nconversational method she had learned from Plato\u2019s dialogues and\nseen exemplified by her fellow transcendentalist and Plato disciple\nBronson Alcott. Her concern was not so much to teach as to provoke\nothers to think more deeply than usual (see Capper 1987). \n\nAmong the many women who attended Fuller\u2019s Conversations a\nnumber would go on to prominence in feminist and other reform causes,\nsuch as Lydia Maria Child, Elizabeth Peabody, Caroline Sturgis, Sophia\nRipley, Julia Ward Howe, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lydian Emerson (wife\nof Ralph Waldo Emerson), Ann Terry Phillips (wife of Wendell\nPhillips), Mary Peabody Mann (wife of Horace Mann), and Mary Channing\n(daughter of William Ellery Channing) (see Capper 2007: 110).\n\nIn these Conversations Fuller sought for a while to avoid discussing\nsocial reform causes other than feminism, such as antislavery, even\nthough some of her participants were already getting involved in them.\nThe British feminist Harriet Martineau, who visited America,\ncriticized her repeatedly for this policy. Eventually Fuller changed\nher mind about this. The Conversations, though she intended them to\nstimulate the thinking of others, also stimulated her own.\n\nIn July 1843, The Dial published as its lead article the\nfruits of Fuller\u2019s new position, \u201cThe Great Lawsuit: Man\nversus Men, Woman versus Women\u201d. Despite its\ntitle, the article was not framed as a lawsuit. It postulates that\nManhood (\u201cMan\u201d) and Womanhood\n(\u201cWoman\u201d) are transcendent ideals that individuals should\nstrive to realize, and that each ideal contains both masculine and\nfeminine qualities. There is no \u201cwholly masculine man; no purely\nfeminine woman\u201d (1843: 14; also in Fuller 1845: 103). But\nbecause men have greater access to the means of self-development, the\nideals of manhood have been more fully realized in practice than those\nof womanhood. This needs to be corrected for the benefit of all\nhumanity. \n\nFuller embraces in this article both Romantic and Enlightenment ideals\nof democracy and scorns America\u2019s cant about democracy while\nbetraying it in practice. \u201cI need not speak of what has been\ndone towards the red man, the black man\u201d (1843: 8; 1845: 14),\nshe comments in disgust. Now she views feminism as expressing a\nparallel objective with the abolition of slavery: both causes labor on\nbehalf of the individual seeking to realize personal potential (as do\nother reform causes like temperance and public education for children\nand the mentally retarded). Only after her move to Europe, however,\nwould her commitment to radical social change become complete.\n\nIn the meantime, Fuller\u2019s embrace of the feminist cause was\nexplained more fully in the enlargement of her \u201cGreat\nLawsuit\u201d article into her book, Woman in the Nineteenth\nCentury, the work for which she is chiefly remembered. She\ncompleted the book in November of 1844. Since the end of her\n\u201cConversations\u201d, she had concluded that feminism was one\nof a number of worthy causes for human emancipation women should\nsupport. The book endorses freedom for Ireland and the return of Jews\nto Palestine, adding an emphatic warning against the annexation of\nTexas because that would strengthen the institution of slavery (Fuller\n1845: 90\u201391).\n\nModern readers will be surprised that Fuller\u2019s book\ndoesn\u2019t mention woman suffrage, which was not then a public\nissue\u2014though of course it was clearly implied by her insistence\non equal rights for women, and Susan B. Anthony did acknowledge Fuller\nas a precursor of the women suffrage movement. Fuller usually\naddresses problems with popular culture rather than legal issues. She\ndoes stress the need for women to have a wider range of occupations\navailable. \n\n\nYou ask me what offices they may fill; I reply\u2014any. I do not\ncare what case you put; let them be sea-captains, if you will. (Often\nmisquoted as \u201clet them be sea-captains, if they will\u201d)\n\n\n\nA greater variety of occupations would help women to realize their\npotential, to \u201crouse their latent powers\u201d, as she put it\n(Fuller 1845: 95). Most often, Fuller addresses the need to transform\nthe marriage relationship. Instead of the woman belonging to the man,\nmarriage should enable the two partners to ally and form a whole\ntogether. Ideally, marriage would be a \u201cpilgrimage toward a\ncommon shrine\u201d (Fuller 1845: 42).\n\nAt the end, her book cries out for an individual woman to be an\nexample to the world: \n\n\nAnd will she not soon appear? The woman who shall vindicate their\nbirthright for all women; who shall teach them what to claim, and how\nto use what they obtain? (Fuller 1845: 97) \n\n\nOnce she had gone to Europe, Margaret Fuller herself would undertake\nthis role.\n\nOne can find fault with Fuller\u2019s book. It does not consistently\naddress its issue with logical development; it rambles, flowing from\none thought to another. She assumes her reader possesses her own wide\nrange of literary and classical learning, frequently making allusions\nthat few readers will actually recognize (especially nowadays).\nFuller\u2019s book anticipated the first women\u2019s rights\nconvention, which would occur in July 1848 at Seneca Falls in upstate\nNew York and demanded women\u2019s suffrage, though even some\nfeminists of the time felt reluctant to endorse such a drastic\nmeasure. The book proved quite popular, not only in the U.S. but also\nin Britain, where it was pirated at a time before publishers were\nrequired to observe international copyright. Hers was the feminist\nbook of its time, analogous to Simone de Beauvoir\u2019s The\nSecond Sex in the mid-twentieth century.\n",
