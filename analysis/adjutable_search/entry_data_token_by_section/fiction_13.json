Truth Through Fiction\n\nAfter his discussion of truth in fiction, Lewis acknowledged in\nPostscript B that some people value fiction \u201cmostly as a means\nfor the discovery of truth, or for the communication of truth\u201d\n(Lewis 1983: 278), that is, genuine truth, not merely fictional truth.\nIt is possible that Lewis simply meant that sentences like \u201cIn\nthe Holmes stories, Holmes is a detective\u201d are really, and not\njust fictionally, true, for this fact captures the sense in which it\nis really true, say, that Holmes is a detective and really false that\nhe is a rockstar. But the problem of whether fiction-involving\nsentences communicate truths does not end here. There are various\nother ways of understanding how fiction might make such a\ncontribution. To begin with, some statements true in a work of fiction\nare also genuine truths, included because the author wanted an\nappropriately realistic setting for the work (e.g., historical\nstatements in works of historical fiction) or in order to acquaint\nreaders with facts that the author regards as morally or politically\nsignificant (consider, for example, the fiction of Charles Dickens,\nUpton Sinclair, or Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn). Whatever the reason, such\ncases suggest that fiction can serve as a means for readers to\ndiscover genuine truths. \n\nPhilosophers and literary theorists by and large agree with this claim\n(Friend 2006; Lamarque & Olsen 1994). Even on imagination-based\ntheories of fiction, there is nothing to prevent statements that\nreaders are invited to imagine as true from also being known as\nfact. This is consistent, however, with acknowledging that learning\nfrom fiction is not always easy, since it requires an ability to tell\nwhether an apparently factual claim in a work of fiction has been\nincluded in the fiction because of its truth or for other\nreasons. More generally, a number of psychological studies suggest\nthat readers often lack the ability to tell truth from falsehood in\nfiction, failing to adequately scrutinize information when engaging\nwith fiction while being more careful in the case of non-fiction (see,\nfor example, Prentice & Gerrig 1999; Wheeler et al. 1999; Butler\net al. 2012). While this propensity on the part of readers\ndoesn\u2019t show that they are never able to gain factual knowledge\nrather than mere (true) belief from engaging with works of fiction, it\nmay make it harder than it first appears. One plausible suggestion is\nthat where there is knowledge rather than mere belief, this happens\nbecause readers have acquired a competence at reliably discriminating\ntruth from falsity in works of that genre (Friend 2014).\n\nBut learning factual truths is not what philosophers and literary\ntheorists usually have in mind when they think of fiction as a means\nfor the discovery, or communication, of truth. They have in mind truth\nthat has deeper human significance, like the universals that Aristotle\nclaims in The Poetics to find in the works of poets, or the\nkind of truth about human nature, for example, that Samuel Johnson\nfinds in Shakespeare (\u201che has not only shewn human nature as it\nacts in real exigencies, but as it would be found in trials, to which\nit cannot be exposed\u201d; Johnson 1765). Many philosophers thus\nembrace what is commonly called (literary) cognitivism, which claims\nthat literary fiction can contribute to readers\u2019 knowledge in a\nway that adds to the literary or aesthetic value of a work (Davies\n2007; Gaut 2005). \n\nBut knowledge in what sense? Like Aristotle, a number of cognitivists\nthink that literature can form the basis of propositional knowledge,\neven if there is dispute about what kind of propositions can be known\nand how they are known (Novitz 1987; McCormick 1988; Carroll 2011;\nKieran 2004; Kivy 1997; Elgin 2007; Mikkonen 2013). A common claim is\nthat literature provides knowledge about moral values, especially\nabout the particular moral requirements of concrete situations\n(cf. the appeal in Nussbaum 1990 to the later novels of Henry\nJames). Some think literature can also provide a kind of conceptual\nknowledge, such as insight into a moral concept like sympathy (John\n1998). Others have thought it can even teach deep psychological truths\nor truths about our place in the world. In many cases, however, the\n\u201ctruths\u201d readers claim to find in literature will be quite\ncontestable, with different works presenting different points of view.\nEven then, however, it might be argued that readers at least acquire\nknowledge of possibilities. Consider, for example, a work like\nC\u00e9line\u2019s Journey to the End of Night (1932),\nwhose underlying hypothesis is that all humans and their institutions\nare abhorrent. Even Putnam, who is broadly sympathetic to cognitivism,\nagrees that all we really learn from C\u00e9line\u2019s work is how\nthe world looks to someone who accepts that hypothesis, which is\nmerely \u201cknowledge of a possibility\u201d (Putnam 1978). \n\nMany cognitivists, however, think that the knowledge we acquire from\nliterary fiction is not centrally a kind of propositional or even\nconceptual knowledge, but a kind of practical knowledge. For example,\nliterature can cause us to attend to the world in a more focused way,\nenriching our perceptual experience and emotional and moral\nunderstanding (Diamond 1995; Nussbaum 1985, 1990, 2001; Gibson 2007;\nRobinson 1995 [1997]). One way it might do this is by being a source\nof what Davies calls categorial understanding (2007: 146),\nyielding new categories through which to understand the world, for\nexample quixotic and Kafkaesque (Goodman 1978:\nch. 4). It can also provide phenomenal knowledge: knowledge of what it\nis like to be a certain kind of person or be in a certain kind of\nsituation, and so knowledge that can be put to use in planning or to\nhelp us understand other people or the moral complexity of situations\n(Kieran 1996; Currie 1998; Putnam 1978; Carroll 2002; Swirski\n2007). \n\nMany are sceptical. Anti-cognitivists think that, whether or not a\nwork\u2019s aesthetic or literary value would be enhanced by\ncontributing knowledge. Echoing Plato\u2019s famous charge in The\nRepublic, Jerome Stolniz (1992) has argued that there is no\nproper domain of artistic knowledge: significant truths found in\nliterary works are the proper subject of other areas of enquiry, not\nliterature. Even if one does acquire beliefs from literary works, the\nworks themselves don\u2019t supply the warrant for the beliefs, and\nso can scarcely be said to yield knowledge.  Furthermore, to the\nextent that we do learn from literature it is either hard to\narticulate what we learn, or the truths turn out to be cognitively\ntrivial; Pride and Prejudice (1813), for example, may teach\nus little more than the banal \u201cStubborn pride and ignorant\nprejudice keep attractive people apart\u201d (Stolniz 1992:\n193). Others have raised doubts about the ability of literary fiction\nto yield the kind of substantial practical knowledge that is often\nclaimed for it. Reading Styron\u2019s historical novel, The\nConfessions of Nat Turner (1967) may make us think we know what\nit was like to be a black slave in early nineteenth century Virginia,\nbut it is surely more likely that exposure of this kind simply\ngenerates the illusion of knowledge (Harold 2016).\n\nCognitivists have fought back in a number of ways. Propositional\ncognitivists have argued that literature does offer support for its\nknowledge claims, say by taking them as live hypotheses to be tested\n(Kivy 1996, Novitz 1987) or by allowing readers to draw on latent\nmemories and other available resources (Carroll 2011) as well as\nargumentative resources explicitly found in the text (Mikkonen 2013).\nAnd both propositional and non-propositional cognitivists have\nacknowledged that there is no certain route to knowledge through\nliterature; as in the case of our acquiring factual beliefs on the\nbasis of reading fiction, literary works can make us less\nknowledgeable (believe falsely or behave unwisely) as well as more\nknowledgeable.\n\nA final point. As we have seen above, literary cognitivists think that\na work of literary fiction can contribute to readers\u2019 knowledge\nin a way that adds to the value of the work; anti-cognitivists deny\nthat it can contribute the kind of knowledge cognitivists focus\non. More radically, however, one of the best-known concerns about\nliterary cognitivism is that, even if literary works do provide\nreaders with knowledge, the knowledge they yield doesn\u2019t\ncontribute to their literary value. Such a non-cognitivist\nview is associated in particular with the work of Lamarque and Olsen,\nwho have offered an influential argument for a \u201cno-truth\u201d\ntheory of literary fiction (Lamarque & Olsen 1994). On this view,\nwhile we may well be able to learn from literature, the truth of a\nclaim made by a literary work is never relevant to the work\u2019s\nliterary value; all that is relevant is a work\u2019s theme and how\nit is presented.  Not surprisingly, this view has also proved highly\ncontentious, with many commentators critical of the separation of\ntheme and truth (see, for example, Rowe 1997; Gaut 2005; Kivy\n2011).\n",
