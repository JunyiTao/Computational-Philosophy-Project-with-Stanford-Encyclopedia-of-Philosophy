    "main_text": "Range of Meanings and Uses || Limiting retributivism\n3.4 Limiting retributivism\n\n\u201cLimiting retributivism\u201d is not so much a conception of\nretributivism as it is retributivism with the addition of skepticism\nabout our ability to make any but the most general statements about\nproportionality (see N. Morris 1982: 182\u201387, 196\u2013200;\nFrase 2005: 77; Slobogin 2009: 671). It is, therefore, a view about\nhow much influence retributivism can have in the practice of\npunishment. Consequentialist considerations, it is proposed, should be\nconsulted to fill in the gap left by the supposed vagueness of\nproportionality. For example, while murder is surely a graver crime\nthan robbery, the range of acceptable punishment for murder may\noverlap with that for robbery. If so, a judge may cite the\nimportance of incapacitation to sentence a robber who seems likely to\nbe a recidivist to a longer sentence than a murderer who, for whatever reason, seems to pose little danger to others in the future.\n\nThis view may move too quickly to invoke consequentialist\nconsiderations. Even if our ability to discern proportionality\nconstraints is crude in absolute terms, comparative proportionality\nmay leave relatively little leeway with regard to what punishments are\nmorally defensible in a given jurisdiction (Robinson 2003; von Hirsch\n& Ashworth 2005: 180\u2013185; von Hirsch 2011: 212; and section\n2 of the supplementary document\n Challenges to the Notion of Retributive Proportionality).\n Nonetheless, insofar as the constraints of proportionality seem\ninherently vague, retributivists may have to make some sort of peace\nwith the thesis of limiting retributivism.\n",
