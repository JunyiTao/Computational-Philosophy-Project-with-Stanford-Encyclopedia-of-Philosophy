    "main_text": "Understanding Music\n4. Understanding Music\n\nA central topic in the understanding of narrative art forms, such as\nliterature and film, is what constitutes an acceptable interpretation\nof a work. One debate concerns whether there is a single correct\ninterpretation of any work or multiple acceptable interpretations.\nAnother concerns the constraints on acceptable interpretations, e.g.,\nthe extent to which the artist\u2019s intentions may or should be\ntaken into account.\n\nThough these questions seem equally applicable to musical works (S.\nDavies 2002a; Dubiel 2011), most of the literature on understanding\nmusic has focused on two more specifically musical topics: first, our\nunderstanding of basic musical features, such as pitch and rhythm and,\nsecond, interpretations of works of the sort given by music theorists.\n(For more detailed introductions to these and other topics in musical\nunderstanding, see S. Davies 2011c and Huovinen 2011.)\n\nBefore we turn to those topics, it is worth noting that two distinct\nactivities go by the name of \u201cinterpretation\u201d in music\n(and other performance arts): what might be called\nperformative and critical interpretation (Levinson\n1993). While a critical interpretation of a musical work (often called\nan analysis) is roughly equivalent to an interpretation of a\nnovel\u2014typically expressed linguistically\u2014a performative\ninterpretation is a way of playing or singing the work, typically\nexpressed in a performance of it. It is not easy to clarify the\nrelationship between these two kinds of musical interpretation, but\nsee Levinson 1993, Maus 1999, Thom 2007, Neufeld 2012, and Dodd\n2020a.\n",
