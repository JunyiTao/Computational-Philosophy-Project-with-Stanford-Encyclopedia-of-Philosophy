    "main_text": "General Theories of the Law of Contracts || Bare promissory duties\n1.1 Bare promissory duties\n\nThe law of contracts prominently employs the language of\npromise-making and promissory obligation. The Restatement (Second) of\nContracts [henceforth: \u201cR2\u201d] defines a contract as\n\n\na promise or a set of promises for the breach of which the law gives a\nremedy, or the performance of which the law in some way recognizes as\na duty. (\u00a71)\n\n\nContracting parties are regularly referred to as\n\u201cpromisor\u201d and \u201cpromisee\u201d. Where there are\nmultiple parties to a contract, the Restatement provides that\n\u201csome or all of them may promise jointly as a unit, or some or\nall of them may each promise severally\u201d. Although the\nRestatement does not state what a promise is, it defines offer and\nacceptance, the pair of acts through which contractual obligations\ncharacteristically arise, in terms that involve an exchange of\npromises. An \u201coffer\u201d is\n\n\nthe manifestation of willingness to enter into a bargain, so made as\nto justify another person in understanding that his assent to that\nbargain is invited and will conclude it. (R2: \u00a724)\n\n\nTo establish a contract, the offer must be met with an appropriate\n\u201cacceptance\u201d, typically\n\n\na manifestation of assent to the terms [of the offer] made by the\nofferee in a manner invited or required by the offer. (\u00a750)\n\n\nBoth formulations closely track conventional philosophical accounts of\npromising, in which a promise arises when a person\n\n\ncommunicates \u2026 an intention to undertake by the very act of\ncommunication an obligation to perform an action and invest the\naddressee with a right to its performance. (Raz 1977:\n210\u2013211)\n\n\nSeveral theorists connect such language to the view that contract law\nenforces promissory morality\u2014that is, moral duties incurred by\npromising. In Contract as Promise, Charles Fried (1981; 2014:\n20) argues that the \u201ccentral organizing moral and doctrinal\nprinciple of contracts is the promise principle\u201d, according to\nwhich \u201ca promise is a kind of moral invention\u2026 [that]\nallows persons to create obligation where there was none\nbefore\u201d. While the importance of realizing such ends as\ninterpersonal trust and coordination may be part of what explains the\nvalue in enforcing promises, on Fried\u2019s view, promissory\ncompliance is \u201can end in itself\u201d. Likewise, Seana Shiffrin\n(2007: 721) invokes contract law\u2019s \u201cexplicit\nself-representation\u201d as a law of promissory obligation as a\nreason for evaluating the law based on the standards of promissory\nmorality.\n\nThe promise-conception finds support in the prevailing remedial scheme\nfor breaches of contract. The standard remedy for breach is money\ndamages that approximate the promisee\u2019s valuation of the\npromised performance. The law calls the remedy \u201cexpectation\ndamages\u201d (R2: \u00a7344 cmt. A). The expectation remedy does not\nsimply \u201cundo\u201d harms suffered by the promisee through\nreliance on the promisor. Rather, the promisor must affirmatively\nvindicate the promisee\u2019s expectation of performance by putting\nthe promisee in as good a position as the promisee would have enjoyed\nhad the promisor performed. To illustrate, if S promises to\nsell B widgets for $4 that B expects to resell at\n$10 for a $6 profit and S fails to deliver the widgets, then\nB\u2019s expectation interest is $6 so long as B\nhasn\u2019t yet paid for the widgets. If B has already made\nthe $4 payment to S, then the expectation interest is $10.\nSince the law opts for expectation over \u201creliance\u201d\ndamages\u2014an alternative measure that returns the parties to their\npre-contractual state\u2014it enforces promissory duties indirectly\nby requiring the promisor to insure the promisee\u2019s value of\nperformance. This feature of contract law distinguishes it from tort\nlaw, where the remedial aim is very much that of restoring a\nstatus quo ante disturbed by a wrong.\n\nThe role that fault plays in breach reinforces contract\u2019s\nconnection to promise and its difference from tort. Whereas tort\nliability is typically fault-based\u2014most torts require intent or\nnegligence\u2014contractual liability is strict and can arise without\nany fault in a promisor. A person might take all reasonable care to\navoid making promises she cannot keep and might make every\ncost-justified effort to keep whatever contractual promises she has\nmade. Yet (with only a few exceptions under narrow doctrines, such as\nimpossibility or frustration of purpose) when the promisor makes and\nbreaks a contractual promise, she remains liable even if performance\nbecomes unexpectedly burdensome or she is unable to perform because of\nthe actions of a third party. Standard accounts of contract therefore\nemphasize that the duty to vindicate the promisee\u2019s expectations\nis legally robust and not easily excused; though for an opposing view\non the significance of fault in contract, see Hillman (2014).\n\nThe contract-as-promise view confronts challenges along three\ndimensions:\n\nwhether promissory morality is a legitimate ground for state\ncoercion;\nwhether the moral assumptions underwriting the view are plausible;\nand\nwhether a promise-based theory can account for certain prominent\nand well-established doctrines of contract law.\n\n\nFirst, it is unclear why a liberal state would be justified in\npromoting promissory virtue for its own sake, which seems a far more\ncontroversial end for the state to adopt than various others that\nmight justify enforcing promises (such as preventing harm to promisees\nor efficient coordination; see below). Raz (1982: 937) argues that\n\u201cenforcing voluntary obligations is not itself a proper goal for\ncontract law\u201d because \u201c[t]o enforce voluntary obligations\n[for their own sake]\u201d would be \u201cto enforce morality\nthrough the legal imposition of duties on individuals\u201d. Raz\nadds, \u201c[i]n this respect, [enforcing promissory morality] does\nnot differ from the legal proscription of pornography\u201d. This\nchallenge is aligned with neutralist conceptions of liberalism. A\nstate that aims at relative neutrality on contested moral claims and\nrestraint in the exercise of power must connect the enforcement of\ncontracts to ends that are widely embraced as worthwhile.\n\nSecond, the moral assumptions about promising that the view imports\nappear questionable. Proponents of the promise-conception endorse what\nRaz (2014) calls the \u201cbare reasons\u201d of promising. The view\nentails that an act of promising generates a moral reason to keep\none\u2019s promise that is independent of (a) the moral desirability\nof the promised acts, (b) whether or not the promisee relied on the\npromise and might be harmed or disappointed by its breach, and (c) the\nvalue in having a mechanism that allows us to bind ourselves. Of\ncourse, this \u201cbare\u201d reason to keep one\u2019s promise\nmight be overridden by competing considerations. Additionally, a\npromise may not generate reasons unless certain conditions are\nsatisfied, including conditions related to the promisor\u2019s\nfreedom from coercion (for the legal analogue of this moral\nrequirement, see R2: \u00a7175), their capacity to promise (cf.\n\u00a7\u00a714, 15, 16), and the promise\u2019s content falling\nwithin certain moral bounds (compare with the illegality doctrine:\n\u00a7178). Still, provided key enabling conditions are met, the\npromise-conception proposes that even bare promises\u2014promises\nwhose breach will not undermine anyone\u2019s trust or cause any\nreliance-based harms\u2014generate moral obligations. But it is\npuzzling why such obligations should arise. The puzzle is clearest if\nobligations are grounded in people\u2019s interests. It is difficult\nto say what interest might support the duty to keep a bare promise,\nsince the ordinary interests that might be in play\u2014associated\nwith reliance and expectations\u2014have been excluded by\nconstruction. Thoughts like these led David Hume to worry that\npromissory obligations purport to \u201carise[] from our mere will\nand pleasure\u201d and to compare such obligations to the mystery of\ntransubstantiation, insofar as both involve intentions that purport to\n\u201cchange[] entirely the nature of an external object, and even of\na human creature\u201d (A Treatise of Human Nature, Bk. III,\nPt. 2, Ch. v).\n\nThe contract-as-promise view must defend bare promissory reasons\nagainst such skepticism. A proposal owing to Owens (2006) treats the\nbreach of a promissory duty as a \u201cbare wronging\u201d, one that\nneedn\u2019t set back any \u201cnon-normative interest\u201d of the\npromisee\u2014for example, their general interest in\nwellbeing\u2014but does set back the promisee\u2019s\n\u201cnormative interest\u201d in having a measure of authority over\nthe promisor. This view may be subject to a circularity challenge. The\nclaim that promisees have normative interests appears to presuppose\nthe fact that needs to be explained\u2014namely, that promises have\nthe relevant authority-conferring effects. For a broader discussion of\nthese and related issues, see the general entry on\n promises,\n bearing in mind that not just any moral theory of promising can be\nslotted into the contract-as-promise view. The view is not\u2014and\ncannot\u2014be neutral on the nature of promissory obligation, given\nthe character of the views it opposes.\n\nFinally, a central challenge for the promise conception is the\ndivergence of well-established legal rules from the rules of\npromissory morality. Shiffrin (2007) offers examples of divergence to\ncriticize the law. For instance, contract law only enforces promises\nthat are supported by adequate \u201cconsideration\u201d. The\nconsideration doctrine, in its modern form, requires a promise to be\npart of a bargain. The Restatement states that\n\n\n[a] performance or return promise is bargained for if it is sought by\nthe promisor in exchange for his promise and is given by the promisee\nin exchange for that promise. (R2: \u00a771)\n\n\nContracts, in other words, arise out of an exchange of promises where\neach party\u2019s promise triggers the other\u2019s, in what Oliver\nWendell Holmes (1881 [1991: 293\u2013294]) calls \u201creciprocal\nconventional inducement\u201d. In exceptional circumstances, a\ngratuitous promise may be enforced in the absence of consideration.\nCertain promises (especially concerning contract modifications) made\namong merchants are enforceable without consideration, as are promises\nto make charitable subscriptions (R2 \u00a790(2); Uniform Commercial\nCode [\u201cUCC\u201d] \u00a7 2-209). More generally, the doctrine\nof promissory estoppel enforces promises that are detrimentally relied\non when considerations of justice demand it (R2 \u00a790). But\npromissory estoppel is in practice narrowly construed and rarely\ninvoked by courts (for a leading case applying the rule in the context\nof pre-contractual bargaining, see Hoffman v. Red Owl Stores,\nInc. [1965], and for a survey of the law that shows\nHoffman\u2019s exceptional status, see Schwartz and Scott\n[2007]).\n\nThe consideration doctrine presents a challenge for the\ncontract-as-promise theory because the rules of promissory morality do\nnot limit obligations in any analogous way. Other limits on contract\nlaw\u2019s willingness to enforce promises\u2014for instance,\ndoctrines relating to fraud and duress\u2014 might track analogous\nlimits in the morality of promising. But there is no obvious reason to\nsuppose that a gratuitous promise\u2014to collect a friend from the\nairport, to give a child a coveted treat, or to keep a friend\u2019s\nsecret\u2014cannot generate moral obligations. The challenge is\nbolstered by the fact that the consideration requirement remains\nentrenched in the common law of contracts despite repeated academic\ncriticism. Even civil law, which includes no formal analog to\nconsideration, nevertheless favors legal enforcement of exchange\npromises in a number of ways.\n\nA second doctrinal challenge to the theory resides in the law\u2019s\nacceptance\u2014and apparent encouragement\u2014of \u201cefficient\nbreach\u201d. As noted above, the standard remedy for breach of\ncontract, expectation damages, vindicates contractual rights through\nsubstitutionary relief: it provides disappointed promisees with a\nmoney award equal to their value of performance. The remedy of\n\u201cspecific performance\u201d\u2014a court injunction ordering\nthe promisor to do as she promised\u2014would more directly enforce\nthe duty to perform. Yet specific performance is not the primary or\nusual judicial remedy. Moreover, the expectation remedy\u2014in fact\nand perhaps also by design\u2014encourages contractual promisors to\nbreach when the costs of performance (including the opportunity costs\nof diverting performance to higher-valuing third parties) exceed the\nvalue of the promisee\u2019s performance. If S promises to\nsell a widget for $10 to B, who values the widget at $15, and\nC offers to buy the same widget from S for $16, then\nthe expectation remedy gives S an incentive to sell to\nC, pay B $5 in expectation damages, and pocket the\nadditional dollar. The breach is efficient insofar as the widget ends\nup in the hands of the party that values it most, and this efficiency\nis cited (both in legal theory and by courts) as a reason for denying\nspecific performance (N. Ind. Pub. Serv. Co. v. Carbon County\nCoal (1986)). By contrast, morality gives promisors no equivalent\nflexibility. This has dismayed some theorists who are attracted to\ncontract as promise (Friedmann 1989). Others deny that there is any\nfundamental conflict, reinterpreting the expectation remedy in terms\nof an implied promise in the alternative, which allows promisors the\nchoice of performing by trading a good for its price or by\ntransferring money equal to the promisee\u2019s value of trade\n(Markovits & Schwartz 2011). Sophisticated parties have good\nreason to make contractual promises in this way, as doing so maximizes\ntheir gains from trade. But unsophisticated parties may think\ncontracts require simple performance and view the legal option of\nsubstituting damages for performance as immoral.\n\nShiffrin and others take departures from promissory morality to be\nreasons for law reform. However, given that theoretical work in this\narea proceeds on the assumption that the normativity of contract law\nis worth engaging with on its own terms, there is reason for desiring\na theory that is not too revisionary. While the contract-as-promise\ntheory is explanatorily powerful and morally appealing, its adequacy\nin the final analysis turns on whether it can plausibly explain away\nthe tensions it perceives in contract law, a question that remains\nvery much unsettled.\n",
