    "main_text": "Necessity\n8. Necessity\n\nPhilosophers have generally held that some contingent truths are (or\ncould be) laws of nature. Furthermore, they have thought that, if it\nis a law that all Fs are Gs, then there need not be\nany (metaphysically) necessary connection between F-ness and\nG-ness, that it is (metaphysically) possible that something\nbe F without being G. For example, any possible\nworld that, as a matter of law, obeys the general principles of\nNewtonian physics is a world in which Newton\u2019s first law is\ntrue, and a world containing accelerating inertial bodies is a world\nin which Newton\u2019s first law is false. The latter world is also a\nworld where inertia is instantiated but does not necessitate zero\nacceleration. Some necessitarians, however, hold that all\nlaws are necessary truths. (See Shoemaker 1980 and 1998, Swoyer 1982,\nFales 1990, Bird 2005. See Vetter 2012 for criticism of Bird 2005 from\nwithin the dispositional essentialist camp.) Others have held\nsomething that is only slightly different. Maintaining that some laws\nare singular statements about universals, they allow that some laws\nare contingently true. So, on this view, an\nF-ness/G-ness law could be false if F-ness\ndoes not exist. Still, this difference is minor. These authors think\nthat, for there to be an F-ness/G-ness law, it must\nbe necessarily true that all Fs are Gs. (See\nTweedale 1984, Bigelow, Ellis, and Lierse 1992, Ellis and Lierse 1994,\nand Ellis 2001, 203\u2013228; 2009, 51\u201372.)\n\nTwo reasons can be given for believing that being a law does not\ndepend on any necessary connection between properties. The first\nreason is the conceivability of it being a law in one possible world\nthat all Fs are Gs even though there is another\nworld with an F that is not G. The second is that\nthere are laws that can only be discovered in an a posteriori\nmanner. If necessity is always associated with laws of nature, then it\nis not clear why scientists cannot always get by with a\npriori methods. Naturally, these two reasons are often\nchallenged. The necessitarians argue that conceivability is not a\nguide to possibility. They also appeal to Saul Kripke\u2019s (1972)\narguments meant to reveal certain a posteriori necessary\ntruths in order to argue that the a posteriori nature of some\nlaws does not prevent their lawhood from requiring a necessary\nconnection between properties. In further support of their own view,\nthe necessitarians argue that their position is a consequence of their\nfavored theory of dispositions, according to which dispositions have\ntheir causal powers essentially. So, for example, on this theory,\ncharge has as part of its essence the power to repel like charges.\nLaws, then, are entailed by the essences of dispositions (cf., Bird\n2005, 356). As necessitarians see it, it is also a virtue of their\nposition that they can explain why laws are counterfactual-supporting;\nthey support counterfactuals in the same way that other necessary\ntruths do (Swoyer 1982, 209; Fales 1990, 85\u201387).\n\nThe primary worry for necessitarians concerns their ability to sustain\ntheir dismissals of the traditional reasons for thinking that some\nlaws are contingent. The problem (cf., Sidelle 2002, 311) is that they\ntoo make distinctions between necessary truths and contingent ones,\nand even seem to rely on considerations of conceivability to do so.\nPrima facie, there is nothing especially suspicious about the judgment\nthat it is possible that an object travel faster than light. How is it\nany worse than the judgment that it is possible that it is raining in\nParis? Another issue for necessitarians is whether their essentialism\nregarding dispositions can sustain all the counterfactuals that are\napparently supported by laws of nature (Lange 2004).\n",
