    "main_text": "The Spirit of the Laws\n4. The Spirit of the Laws\n\n\nMontesquieu's aim in The Spirit of the Laws is to explain human\nlaws and social institutions. This might seem like an impossible\nproject: unlike physical laws, which are, according to Montesquieu,\ninstituted and sustained by God, positive laws and social institutions\nare created by fallible human beings who are \"subject ... to ignorance\nand error, [and] hurried away by a thousand impetuous passions\" (SL\n1.1). One might therefore expect our laws and institutions to be no\nmore comprehensible than any other catalog of human follies, an\nexpectation which the extraordinary diversity of laws adopted by\ndifferent societies would seem to confirm.\n\n Nonetheless, Montesquieu believes that this apparent chaos is much\nmore comprehensible than one might think. On his view, the key to\nunderstanding different laws and social systems is to recognize that\nthey should be adapted to a variety of different factors, and cannot\nbe properly understood unless one considers them in this\nlight. Specifically, laws should be adapted \"to the people for whom\nthey are framed..., to the nature and principle of each government,\n... to the climate of each country, to the quality of its soil, to its\nsituation and extent, to the principal occupation of the natives,\nwhether husbandmen, huntsmen or shepherds: they should have relation\nto the degree of liberty which the constitution will bear; to the\nreligion of the inhabitants, to their inclinations, riches, numbers,\ncommerce, manners, and customs. In fine, they have relations to each\nother, as also to their origin, to the intent of the legislator, and\nto the order of things on which they are established; in all of which\ndifferent lights they ought to be considered\" (SL 1.3). When we\nconsider legal and social systems in relation to these various\nfactors, Montesquieu believes, we will find that many laws and\ninstitutions that had seemed puzzling or even perverse are in fact\nquite comprehensible.\n\n Understanding why we have the laws we do is important in\nitself. However, it also serves practical purposes. Most importantly,\nit will discourage misguided attempts at reform. Montesquieu is not a\nutopian, either by temperament or conviction. He believes that to live\nunder a stable, non-despotic government that leaves its law-abiding\ncitizens more or less free to live their lives is a great good, and\nthat no such government should be lightly tampered with. If we\nunderstand our system of government, and the ways in which it is\nadapted to the conditions of our country and its people, we will see\nthat many of its apparently irrational features actually make sense,\nand that to 'reform' these features would actually weaken it. Thus,\nfor instance, one might think that a monarchical government would be\nstrengthened by weakening the nobility, thereby giving more power to\nthe monarch. On Montesquieu's view, this is false: to weaken those\ngroups or institutions which check a monarch's power is to risk\ntransforming monarchy into despotism, a form of government that is\nboth abhorrent and unstable.\n\n Understanding our laws will also help us to see which aspects of them\nare genuinely in need of reform, and how these reforms might be\naccomplished. For instance, Montesquieu believes that the laws of many\ncountries can be made be more liberal and more humane, and that they\ncan often be applied less arbitrarily, with less scope for the\nunpredictable and oppressive use of state power. Likewise, religious\npersecution and slavery can be abolished, and commerce can be\nencouraged. These reforms would generally strengthen monarchical\ngovernments, since they enhance the freedom and dignity of\ncitizens. If lawmakers understand the relations between laws on the\none hand and conditions of their countries and the principles of their\ngovernments on the other, they will be in a better position to carry\nout such reforms without undermining the governments they seek to\nimprove.\n",
