    "main_text": "Physical Substance || The Metaphysics of Number (sa\u1e43khy\u0101)\n2.3 The Metaphysics of Number (sa\u1e43khy\u0101)\n\nThe Navya-Ny\u0101ya account of number has been likened in content and\nsophistication to that of Frege, and is indeed fascinating. The\nManual of Reason says only that numbers are qualities\n(gu\u1e47a-s), that they are the ground for numerical\njudgements, and that they range from 1 to a very high number called\npar\u0101rdha (1014. Note here again discomfort with the idea\nof infinity). The view that numbers are qualities is in fact\nassociated with old Vai\u015be\u1e63ika, and turned out to be\nirreconcilable with the structure of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika\nontological system. We may speak of there being three horses in the\nfield, but also of there being 24 qualities in the\nVai\u015be\u1e63ika system. Yet a quality cannot by definition reside\nin another quality\u2014hence numbers cannot be qualities. This\nproblem led the Navya-Naiy\u0101yikas to develop a new account of\nnumbers, based on a new type of relation called the\npary\u0101pti or \u2018completing\u2019 relation.\n\nHere is a summary of their theory. Consider the following pair of\nsentences:\n\nThe table has wooden legs\nThe table has four legs.\n\n\nThe similarity between (1) and (2) suggests that we think of\nnumber-words as akin to other adjectives, i.e. as attributing some\nproperty to the object/s they qualify. The Ny\u0101ya say that, in\n(1), the property of being wooden resides in the legs of the table by\nthe relation of inherence. Can we analyse (2) the same way, as stating\nthat a universal property four-hood inheres in the legs? The new\nNy\u0101ya (esp. Raghun\u0101tha and Jagad\u012b\u015ba) answer in the\nnegative. For note that (1) entails\n\nEach leg is wooden.\n\n\nHowever, (2) does not entail,\n\nEach leg is four.\n\n\nThe solution offered is to postulate a new relation,\n\u2018completion\u2019, which relates the property fourhood to the\nfour legs jointly, but not to each leg individually.\nRaghun\u0101tha remarks that \u201cthe \u2018completion\u2019\nrelation, whose existence is indicated by constructions such as\n\u2018This is one pot\u2019 and \u2018These are two\u2019, is a\nspecial kind of self-linking relation.\u201d His commentator\nJagad\u012b\u015ba adds:\n\nIt might be thought that the \u2018completion\u2019 relation is\nnothing but inherence\u2026So Raghun\u0101tha states that\n\u2018completion\u2019 is a another relation\u2026.In a sentence\nlike \u201cThese are two pots\u201d, \u2018completion\u2019\nrelates the property two-hood by delimiting it as a property which\nresides in both pots. Otherwise, it would follow that there is no\ndifference between saying \u201cThese are two\u201d and \u201cEach\none possesses two-hood\u201d.\n\n\nThe proposal is that number properties are related jointly to objects\nby the many-one relation \u2018completion\u2019. I think we can\nsimplify this proposal a little without losing its essential\nstructure. Rather than saying, in a sentence like \u201cMars is a\nplanet\u201d, that the property planethood resides in Mars by the\ninherence relation, we would now say that the predicate\n\u201c\u2026is a planet\u201d is true of Mars, so to speak\nbuilding the inherence relation (or copula) into the predicate. In an\nentirely analogous way, we can build the completion relation into the\nnumber-predicate, which then becomes, if the number is n, an\nn-place relation. Thus the sentence \u201cVenus and Mars are\ntwo\u201d asserts of Venus and Mars that they stand in a certain\n2-place relation, the relation which is the number 2. The Ny\u0101ya\nidea, then, is that number-adjectives are n-place relational\npredicates, and that numbers are n-place relations holding\njointly between n distinct objects. It in no way follows from\nthe statement that the relation 2 holds between Venus and Mars, that\nit holds just with Venus, any more than it follows from the statement\nthat X is to the left of Y, that X is to\nthe left, full stop. On the Ny\u0101ya proposal, then, it looks as\nthough the troublesome inference is blocked because its conclusion is\nnot even well-formed, since the phrase \u201cVenus is two\u201d,\nlike the phrase \u201cX is to the left\u201d, is an\nincomplete or unsaturated expression.\n\nThe Ny\u0101ya, we have seen, distinguish two relations, the inherence\nand completion relations. Their motive is, as we might now say, to\naccount for the distinction between collective and distributive\nproperties. For the recognition that the inference from \u201cThese\nare two pots\u201d to \u201cEach pot is two\u201d is invalid is\njust the recognition that the predicate two does not distribute over\nplural subjects. The Ny\u0101ya idea is to analyse collective\npredicates like \u2018\u2026are two\u2019, not as one-place\npredicates of aggregates or sets, but as n-place relational\npredicates, true of n objects jointly. But since such relational\npredicates still take objects as subjects, this indeed shows that\nrecognising the distinction between distributive and collective\npredicates does not force us to abandon the adjectival view. The\nNy\u0101ya, indeed, have a term for collective properties: they call\nthem vy\u0101sajya-v\u1e5btti-dharma or \u2018properties\nwhich occur jointly\u2019.\n\n",
