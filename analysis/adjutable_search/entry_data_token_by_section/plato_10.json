    "main_text": "The historical Socrates: early, middle, and late dialogues\n11. The historical Socrates: early, middle, and late dialogues\n\nMany contemporary scholars find it plausible that when Plato embarked\non his career as a philosophical writer, he composed, in addition to\nhis Apology of Socrates, a number of short ethical dialogues\nthat contain little or nothing in the way of positive philosophical\ndoctrine, but are mainly devoted to portraying the way in which\nSocrates punctured the pretensions of his interlocutors and forced\nthem to realize that they are unable to offer satisfactory definitions\nof the ethical terms they used, or satisfactory arguments for their\nmoral beliefs. According to this way of placing the dialogues into a\nrough chronological order\u2014associated especially with Gregory\nVlastos\u2019s name (see especially his Socrates Ironist and\nMoral Philosopher, chapters 2 and 3)\u2014Plato, at this point\nof his career, was content to use his writings primarily for the\npurpose of preserving the memory of Socrates and making plain the\nsuperiority of his hero, in intellectual skill and moral seriousness,\nto all of his contemporaries\u2014particularly those among them who\nclaimed to be experts on religious, political, or moral matters. Into\nthis category of early dialogues (they are also sometimes called\n\u201cSocratic\u201d dialogues, possibly without any intended\nchronological connotation) are placed: Charmides,\nCrito, Euthydemus, Euthyphro,\nGorgias, Hippias Major, Hippias\nMinor, Ion, Laches, Lysis, and\nProtagoras, (Some scholars hold that we can tell which of\nthese come later during Plato\u2019s early period. For example, it is\nsometimes said that Protagoras and Gorgias are\nlater, because of their greater length and philosophical complexity.\nOther dialogues\u2014for example, Charmides and\nLysis\u2014are thought not to be among Plato\u2019s\nearliest within this early group, because in them Socrates appears to\nbe playing a more active role in shaping the progress of the dialogue:\nthat is, he has more ideas of his own.) In comparison with many of\nPlato\u2019s other dialogues, these \u201cSocratic\u201d works\ncontain little in the way of metaphysical, epistemological, or\nmethodological speculation, and they therefore fit well with the way\nSocrates characterizes himself in Plato\u2019s Apology: as a\nman who leaves investigations of high falutin\u2019 matters (which\nare \u201cin the sky and below the earth\u201d) to wiser heads, and\nconfines all of his investigations to the question how one should live\none\u2019s life. Aristotle describes Socrates as someone whose\ninterests were restricted to only one branch of philosophy\u2014the\nrealm of the ethical; and he also says that he was in the habit of\nasking definitional questions to which he himself lacked answers\n(Metaphysics 987b1, Sophistical Refutations 183b7).\nThat testimony gives added weight to the widely accepted hypothesis\nthat there is a group of dialogues\u2014the ones mentioned above as\nhis early works, whether or not they were all written early in\nPlato\u2019s writing career\u2014in which Plato used the dialogue\nform as a way of portraying the philosophical activities of the\nhistorical Socrates (although, of course, he might also have used them\nin other ways as well\u2014for example to suggest and begin to\nexplore philosophical difficulties raised by them, see Santas 1979,\nBrickhouse and Smith 1994).\n\nBut at a certain point\u2014so says this hypothesis about the\nchronology of the dialogues\u2014Plato began to use his works to\nadvance ideas that were his own creations rather than those of\nSocrates, although he continued to use the name \u201cSocrates\u201d\nfor the interlocutor who presented and argued for these new ideas. The\nspeaker called \u201cSocrates\u201d now begins to move beyond and\ndepart from the historical Socrates: he has views about the\nmethodology that should be used by philosophers (a methodology\nborrowed from mathematics), and he argues for the immortality of the\nsoul and the existence and importance of the forms of beauty, justice,\ngoodness, and the like. (By contrast, in Apology Socrates\nsays that no one knows what becomes of us after we die.)\nPhaedo is often said to be the dialogue in which Plato first\ncomes into his own as a philosopher who is moving far beyond the ideas\nof his teacher (though it is also commonly said that we see a new\nmethodological sophistication and a greater interest in mathematical\nknowledge in Meno). Having completed all of the dialogues\nthat, according to this hypothesis, we characterize as early, Plato\nwidened the range of topics to be explored in his writings (no longer\nconfining himself to ethics), and placed the theory of forms (and\nrelated ideas about language, knowledge, and love) at the center of\nhis thinking. In these works of his \u201cmiddle\u201d\nperiod\u2014for example, in Phaedo, Cratylus,\nSymposium, Republic, and\nPhaedrus\u2014there is both a change of emphasis and of\ndoctrine. The focus is no longer on ridding ourselves of false ideas\nand self-deceit; rather, we are asked to accept (however tentatively)\na radical new conception of ourselves (now divided into three parts),\nour world\u2014or rather, our two worlds\u2014and our need to\nnegotiate between them. Definitions of the most important virtue terms\nare finally proposed in Republic (the search for them in some\nof the early dialogues having been unsuccessful): Book I of this\ndialogue is a portrait of how the historical Socrates might have\nhandled the search for a definition of justice, and the rest of the\ndialogue shows how the new ideas and tools discovered by Plato can\ncomplete the project that his teacher was unable to finish. Plato\ncontinues to use a figure called \u201cSocrates\u201d as his\nprincipal interlocutor, and in this way he creates a sense of\ncontinuity between the methods, insights, and ideals of the historical\nSocrates and the new Socrates who has now become a vehicle for the\narticulation of his own new philosophical outlook. In doing so, he\nacknowledges his intellectual debt to his teacher and appropriates for\nhis own purposes the extraordinary prestige of the man who was the\nwisest of his time.\n\nThis hypothesis about the chronology of Plato\u2019s writings has a\nthird component: it does not place his works into either of only two\ncategories\u2014the early or \u201cSocratic\u201d dialogues, and\nall the rest\u2014but works instead with a threefold division of\nearly, middle, and late. That is because, following ancient testimony,\nit has become a widely accepted assumption that Laws is one\nof Plato\u2019s last works, and further that this dialogue shares a\ngreat many stylistic affinities with a small group of others:\nSophist, Statesman, Timaeus,\nCritias, and Philebus. These five dialogues together\nwith Laws are generally agreed to be his late works, because\nthey have much more in common with each other, when one counts certain\nstylistic features apparent only to readers of Plato\u2019s Greek,\nthan with any of Plato\u2019s other works. (Computer counts have\naided these stylometric studies, but the isolation of a group of six\ndialogues by means of their stylistic commonalities was recognized in\nthe nineteenth century. See Brandwood 1990, Young 1994.)\n\nIt is not at all clear whether there are one or more\nphilosophical affinities among this group of six\ndialogues\u2014that is, whether the philosophy they contain is\nsharply different from that of all of the other dialogues. Plato does\nnothing to encourage the reader to view these works as a distinctive\nand separate component of his thinking. On the contrary, he links\nSophist with Theaetetus (the conversations they\npresent have a largely overlapping cast of characters, and take place\non successive days) no less than Sophist and\nStatesman. Sophist contains, in its opening pages, a\nreference to the conversation of Parmenides\u2014and perhaps\nPlato is thus signaling to his readers that they should bring to bear\non Sophist the lessons that are to be drawn from\nParmenides. Similarly, Timaeus opens with a reminder\nof some of the principal ethical and political doctrines of\nRepublic. It could be argued, of course, that when one looks\nbeyond these stage-setting devices, one finds significant\nphilosophical changes in the six late dialogues, setting this group\noff from all that preceded them. But there is no consensus that they\nshould be read in this way. Resolving this issue requires intensive\nstudy of the content of Plato\u2019s works. So, although it is widely\naccepted that the six dialogues mentioned above belong to\nPlato\u2019s latest period, there is, as yet, no agreement among\nstudents of Plato that these six form a distinctive stage in his\nphilosophical development.\n\nIn fact, it remains a matter of dispute whether the division of\nPlato\u2019s works into three periods\u2014early, middle,\nlate\u2014does correctly indicate the order of composition, and\nwhether it is a useful tool for the understanding of his thought (See\nCooper 1997, vii\u2013xxvii). Of course, it would be wildly\nimplausible to suppose that Plato\u2019s writing career began with\nsuch complex works as Laws, Parmenides,\nPhaedrus, or Republic. In light of widely accepted\nassumptions about how most philosophical minds develop, it is likely\nthat when Plato started writing philosophical works some of the\nshorter and simpler dialogues were the ones he composed:\nLaches, or Crito, or Ion (for example).\n(Similarly, Apology does not advance a complex philosophical\nagenda or presuppose an earlier body of work; so that too is likely to\nhave been composed near the beginning of Plato\u2019s writing\ncareer.) Even so, there is no good reason to eliminate the hypothesis\nthat throughout much of his life Plato devoted himself to writing two\nsorts of dialogues at the same time, moving back and forth between\nthem as he aged: on the one hand, introductory works whose primary\npurpose is to show readers the difficulty of apparently simple\nphilosophical problems, and thereby to rid them of their pretensions\nand false beliefs; and on the other hand, works filled with more\nsubstantive philosophical theories supported by elaborate\nargumentation. Moreover, one could point to features of many of the\n\u201cSocratic\u201d dialogues that would justify putting them in\nthe latter category, even though the argumentation does not concern\nmetaphysics or methodology or invoke\nmathematics\u2014Gorgias, Protagoras,\nLysis, Euthydemus, Hippias Major among\nthem.\n\nPlato makes it clear that both of these processes, one preceding the\nother, must be part of one\u2019s philosophical education. One of his\ndeepest methodological convictions (affirmed in Meno,\nTheaetetus, and Sophist) is that in order to make\nintellectual progress we must recognize that knowledge cannot be\nacquired by passively receiving it from others: rather, we must work\nour way through problems and assess the merits of competing theories\nwith an independent mind. Accordingly, some of his dialogues are\nprimarily devices for breaking down the reader\u2019s complacency,\nand that is why it is essential that they come to no positive\nconclusions; others are contributions to theory-construction, and are\ntherefore best absorbed by those who have already passed through the\nfirst stage of philosophical development. We should not assume that\nPlato could have written the preparatory dialogues only at the\nearliest stage of his career. Although he may well have begun his\nwriting career by taking up that sort of project, he may have\ncontinued writing these \u201cnegative\u201d works at later stages,\nat the same time that he was composing his theory-constructing\ndialogues. For example although both Euthydemus and\nCharmides are widely assumed to be early dialogues, they\nmight have been written around the same time as Symposium and\nRepublic, which are generally assumed to be compositions of\nhis middle period\u2014or even later.\n\nNo doubt, some of the works widely considered to be early really are\nsuch. But it is an open question which and how many of them are. At\nany rate, it is clear that Plato continued to write in a\n\u201cSocratic\u201d and \u201cnegative\u201d vein even after he\nwas well beyond the earliest stages of his career: Theaetetus\nfeatures a Socrates who is even more insistent upon his ignorance than\nare the dramatic representations of Socrates in briefer and\nphilosophically less complex works that are reasonably assumed to be\nearly; and like many of those early works, Theaetetus seeks\nbut does not find the answer to the \u201cwhat is it?\u201d question\nthat it relentlessly pursues\u2014\u201cWhat is knowledge?\u201d\nSimilarly, Parmenides, though certainly not an early\ndialogue, is a work whose principal aim is to puzzle the reader by the\npresentation of arguments for apparently contradictory conclusions;\nsince it does not tell us how it is possible to accept all of those\nconclusions, its principal effect on the reader is similar to that of\ndialogues (many of them no doubt early) that reach only negative\nconclusions. Plato uses this educational device\u2014provoking the\nreader through the presentation of opposed arguments, and leaving the\ncontradiction unresolved\u2014in Protagoras (often\nconsidered an early dialogue) as well. So it is clear that even after\nhe was well beyond the earliest stages of his thinking, he continued\nto assign himself the project of writing works whose principal aim is\nthe presentation of unresolved difficulties. (And, just as we should\nrecognize that puzzling the reader continues to be his aim even in\nlater works, so too we should not overlook the fact that there is some\nsubstantive theory-construction in the ethical works that are simple\nenough to have been early compositions: Ion, for example,\naffirms a theory of poetic inspiration; and Crito sets out\nthe conditions under which a citizen acquires an obligation to obey\ncivic commands. Neither ends in failure.)\n\nIf we are justified in taking Socrates\u2019 speech in Plato\u2019s\nApology to constitute reliable evidence about what the\nhistorical Socrates was like, then whatever we find in Plato\u2019s\nother works that is of a piece with that speech can also be safely\nattributed to Socrates. So understood, Socrates was a moralist but\n(unlike Plato) not a metaphysician or epistemologist or cosmologist.\nThat fits with Aristotle\u2019s testimony, and Plato\u2019s way of\nchoosing the dominant speaker of his dialogues gives further support\nto this way of distinguishing between him and Socrates. The number of\ndialogues that are dominated by a Socrates who is spinning out\nelaborate philosophical doctrines is remarkably small:\nPhaedo, Republic, Phaedrus, and\nPhilebus. All of them are dominated by ethical issues:\nwhether to fear death, whether to be just, whom to love, the place of\npleasure. Evidently, Plato thinks that it is appropriate to make\nSocrates the major speaker in a dialogue that is filled with positive\ncontent only when the topics explored in that work primarily have to\ndo with the ethical life of the individual. (The political aspects of\nRepublic are explicitly said to serve the larger question\nwhether any individual, no matter what his circumstances, should be\njust.) When the doctrines he wishes to present systematically become\nprimarily metaphysical, he turns to a visitor from Elea\n(Sophist, Statesman); when they become cosmological,\nhe turns to Timaeus; when they become constitutional, he turns, in\nLaws, to a visitor from Athens (and he then eliminates\nSocrates entirely). In effect, Plato is showing us: although he owes a\ngreat deal to the ethical insights of Socrates, as well as to his\nmethod of puncturing the intellectual pretensions of his interlocutors\nby leading them into contradiction, he thinks he should not put into\nthe mouth of his teacher too elaborate an exploration of ontological,\nor cosmological, or political themes, because Socrates refrained from\nentering these domains. This may be part of the explanation why he has\nSocrates put into the mouth of the personified Laws of Athens the\ntheory advanced in Crito, which reaches the conclusion that\nit would be unjust for him to escape from prison. Perhaps Plato is\nindicating, at the point where these speakers enter the dialogue, that\nnone of what is said here is in any way derived from or inspired by\nthe conversation of Socrates.\n\nJust as we should reject the idea that Plato must have made a\ndecision, at a fairly early point in his career, no longer to write\none kind of dialogue (negative, destructive, preparatory) and to write\nonly works of elaborate theory-construction; so we should also\nquestion whether he went through an early stage during which he\nrefrained from introducing into his works any of his own ideas (if he\nhad any), but was content to play the role of a faithful portraitist,\nrepresenting to his readers the life and thought of Socrates. It is\nunrealistic to suppose that someone as original and creative as Plato,\nwho probably began to write dialogues somewhere in his thirties (he\nwas around 28 when Socrates was killed), would have started his\ncompositions with no ideas of his own, or, having such ideas, would\nhave decided to suppress them, for some period of time, allowing\nhimself to think for himself only later. (What would have led to such\na decision?) We should instead treat the moves made in the dialogues,\neven those that are likely to be early, as Platonic\ninventions\u2014derived, no doubt, by Plato\u2019s reflections on\nand transformations of the key themes of Socrates that he attributes\nto Socrates in Apology. That speech indicates, for example,\nthat the kind of religiosity exhibited by Socrates was unorthodox and\nlikely to give offense or lead to misunderstanding. It would be\nimplausible to suppose that Plato simply concocted the idea that\nSocrates followed a divine sign, especially because Xenophon too\nattributes this to his Socrates. But what of the various philosophical\nmoves rehearsed in Euthyphro\u2014the dialogue in which\nSocrates searches, unsuccessfully, for an understanding of what piety\nis? We have no good reason to think that in writing this work Plato\nadopted the role of a mere recording device, or something close to it\n(changing a word here and there, but for the most part simply\nrecalling what he heard Socrates say, as he made his way to court). It\nis more likely that Plato, having been inspired by the unorthodoxy of\nSocrates\u2019 conception of piety, developed, on his own, a series\nof questions and answers designed to show his readers how difficult it\nis to reach an understanding of the central concept that\nSocrates\u2019 fellow citizens relied upon when they condemned him to\ndeath. The idea that it is important to search for definitions may\nhave been Socratic in origin. (After all, Aristotle attributes this\nmuch to Socrates.) But the twists and turns of the arguments in\nEuthyphro and other dialogues that search for definitions are\nmore likely to be the products of Plato\u2019s mind than the content\nof any conversations that really took place.\n",
