All things\nconsidered, everything boils down to a few clear theoretical theses\nthat had far\u2013reaching repercussions throughout both philosophy\nand society. This work had three different editions: 1785, 1789, and\n1819. The first edition opens with Goethe\u2019s poem \u2018das\nG\u00f6ttliche\u2019. It proceeds to a short report of the\ncircumstances that led Jacobi to contact Mendelssohn, followed by the\npresentation of the first letter Jacobi sent to him in 1783. A second\npoem by Goethe, \u2018Prometheus\u2019, follows, suggesting that\nhere the first section of the book has come to an end, establishing\nthe core subject of the controversy: rationality displaying its\nfundamental proposition with the principle a nihilo nihil fit\n(Jacobi, 1994 (2): 187 and JWA 1,1: 16\u201317).\n\nThis principle offers a glimpse of an approach to knowledge, according\nto which everything is necessarily and sufficiently determined by its\nground (Grund). For this, the principle of the ground\ninscribes all instances within a system of references that supports\ntheir determination (Sandkaulen, 2000; Della Rocca, 2015). Thus, the\nprinciple of the ground may be a crucial topic in metaphysics, as it\nprovides the guidelines for both epistemology and ontology (Fine,\n2012). Jacobi\u2019s critical view of systematic knowledge pivots\naround this principle, although he does not imply that systematic\nknowledge should be rejected without reservation. Systematic knowledge\nmeets a rational need, as it seems to pose a perfect balance between a\nuniversal design and singular entities. Jacobi contends that a closer\nreading, however, uncovers that those singular entities, when\ninscribed in that universal design, lose their identity and substance.\nReality, as conceived through the principle of the ground, is merely\nan all\u2013devouring whole that does not provide any room for\nindividuals.\n\nIf we examine the arch that extends from the first poem to the second\n(from \u2018das G\u00f6ttliche\u2019 to \u2018Prometheus\u2019),\nit is easy to decipher Jacobi\u2019s twofold intention: on one side,\nhe celebrates the human capacity to transcend systematic determinism\n(\u2018das G\u00f6ttliche\u2019); on the other, he faces the\nappalling truth that rationality appears to call for a deterministic\nuniverse that is dominated by a blind fate that disregards individuals\n(\u2018Prometheus\u2019). The only Promethean way out is to rise\nagainst this systematic determination of reality in a rebellion that\nshould be based upon a different understanding of rationality and\nreality. In fact, it must be stressed, Jacobi does not provide an\nalternative to philosophical determinism out of a poetic illusion.\nInstead, he calls for a rational, not poetic, alternative to\nrationalism.\n\nAfter being accused of defending Spinoza, due to his great regard for\nSpinoza\u2019s philosophy, and then being blamed for not reading\nSpinoza accurately enough, Jacobi provides to Mendelssohn a solid,\nthough synthetic, analysis of Spinoza\u2019s \u2018Ethics\u2019. In\nthis text, Jacobi not only displays his accuracy in analysis (at least\ntaking into account the general framework of Spinoza\u2019s\n\u2018Ethics\u2019) but also his insight in interpretation (Jacobi,\n1994 (2): 217\u2013228 and JWA 1,1: 92\u2013112). Spinoza should be\nconsidered, according to Jacobi, the pinnacle of rationalism and the\nultimate outcome of a coherent evolutionary narrative of the\ntraditional metaphysics inaugurated by Aristotle (Jacobi, 1994 (2):\n227 and JWA 1,1: 110\u2013111). Nevertheless, Jacobi adds, that very\nsame rationalism is also the cause of a thorough disregard for the\nexistence of concrete individuals, which is grounded upon their\npractical certitude (true freedom) (Jacobi, 1994 (2): 229 and 234 and\nJWA 1,1: 113 and 120\u2013125). Jacobi\u2019s critique of\nrationalism implies his counterproposal, providing a new platform for\nnotions that could rationally support individual existence (Jacobi,\n1994 (2): 233\u2013234 and JWA 1,1: 120\u2013125). Jacobi considers\nthat individuality must be conceived together with the profile of a\nfree human being, an existent that is precisely the prime victim of\nSpinozism (Jacobi, 1994 (2): 193 and JWA 1,1: 27\u201328). However,\nbecause Jacobi\u2019s notion of freedom represents a necessary basis\nfor all existence, the eradication of any rational justification of\nfree human beings not only erases the notion of true freedom but also\neradicates existence in general (Jacobi, 1994 (2): 212 and JWA 1,1:\n78\u201379).\n\nJacobi urges philosophers embroiled in metaphysical rationalism to\nperform a salto mortale (i.e., a somersault,\njumping\u2013head\u2013over\u2013heels) to redress their position\nin the face of reality (Jacobi, 1994 (2): 195 and JWA 1,1: 30).\nInstead of an illusory purity of a self\u2013contained system of\nexplanations, true knowledge must be grounded upon an immediate\nrecognition of an I that acts upon and reacts to a world that is\nexternal to it (Sandkaulen, 2000: 11\u201322). Jacobi\u2019s\nUnphilosophie does not merely contradict systematic\nknowledge. More precisely, it intends to amend systematic knowledge by\nproviding its missing footing: only when we assume the concrete\nexistence are we justified with regard to any other claim concerning\nreality. Explanations are thus not entirely a bad habit. It is only\nthat they come second, after the subject has assumed its own existence\nas paradigm of existence as such. What Jacobi is really rejecting here\nis the thesis according to which the system of explanations is\nself\u2013sufficient. The only issue here is that the first\nassumption of our knowledge (existence) is and must be immediate; if\nit were mediated and explained, then the basis for the mediation would\nfall into the system of explanations that eradicates all true\nexistence. The salto mortale would thus be nothing more than\nthe logical act that any philosopher must perform, taking into account\nthe total annihilation of substantiality yielded by systematic\nknowledge. Instead of pure discursive thinking, Jacobi combines the\nlogical act of the salto mortale with the epistemology of the\nGlaube (Jacobi, 1994 (2): 234 and 270\u2013303 and JWA 2,1:\n27\u201367), referring to the immediate assumption of an existence\ngranted by a practical I. This higher knowledge, often associated with\nspecific faculties, such as Gef\u00fchl and Sinn,\nlabels both Jacobi\u2019s fundamental contribution to epistemology\nand his most controversial teaching (Bowman, 2021).\n\nNotwithstanding that his notion of faith (Glaube) does not\nhave any religious underpinning, some unfortunate, final references to\nJ.K. Lavater and K.W. Jerusalem expose Jacobi\u2019s \u2018Spinoza\nBriefen\u2019 to the charge of irrationalism and fideism. These\naccusations were not arbitrary though. Jacobi\u2019s use of the terms\nGlaube (faith) and Offenbarung (revelation) to\npresent his reformed epistemology did avert suspicion. The publication\nof the \u2018David Hume Dialogue\u2019 was in fact a direct\nconsequence of his need to clear himself of both charges.\n",
