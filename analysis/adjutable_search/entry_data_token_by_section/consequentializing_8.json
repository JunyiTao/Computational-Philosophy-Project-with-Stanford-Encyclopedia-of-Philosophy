    "main_text": "Objections to Consequentializing || Some Key Features of Commonsense Morality Cannot Be Consequentialized\n4.2 Some Key Features of Commonsense Morality Cannot Be Consequentialized\n\nSome argue that it\u2019s not possible to consequentialize every\nplausible non-consequentialist theory (see, e.g., Brown 2011). As\nwe\u2019ll see below, their being correct would be a problem for both\nnotional consequentializers and pragmatic consequentializers, but not\nnecessarily for earnest consequentializers.\n\nBoth the notational consequentializer and the pragmatic\nconsequentializer are committed to what\u2019s known as the\nExtensional Equivalence Thesis: for every plausible\nnon-consequentialist theory, there is an act-consequentialist\ncounterpart theory that yields, in every possible world, the same set\nof deontic verdicts that it yields (Dreier 2011: 98). The notational\nconsequentializer is committed to this, for it is just the first\npremise in their assimilation argument for consequentializing. And the\npragmatic consequentializer is committed to this, for the second\npremise in their pragmatic argument for consequentializing assumes\nthat, in consequentializing a non-consequentialist theory, we can\nfaithfully represent its extension.\n\nNevertheless, the Extensional Equivalence Thesis is controversial. For\ninstance, Campbell Brown (2011) has argued that the consequentializer\ncannot accommodate prohibition dilemmas: situations in which every\navailable act is impermissible. Now, whenever there are certain\ndeontic verdicts that the act-consequentialist supposedly cannot\naccommodate, there are two options for proponents of the Extensional\nEquivalence Thesis. One option is to concede that the\nact-consequentialist cannot accommodate such verdicts but argue that\nany non-consequentialist theory that includes such verdicts is\nimplausible. This is what Dreier does concerning prohibition dilemmas\n(see Dreier 2011: 105\u20136). The other option is to argue that,\ndespite appearances, there\u2019s a way for the act-consequentialist\nto accommodate these deontic verdicts. Some argue, for instance, that\nthe consequentialist can accommodate prohibition dilemmas by adopting\na cyclic ranking of outcomes (Peterson 2010: 158). Thus, if the target\nnon-consequentialist theory holds that all three of an agent\u2019s\noptions\u2014say, A, B, and C\u2014are\nimpermissible, then the consequentialist can just adopt a ranking\nwhere A\u2019s outcome outranks B\u2019s outcome,\nB\u2019s outcome outranks C\u2019s outcome, and\nC\u2019s outcome outranks A\u2019s outcome. Since\neach outcome is outranked by that of some available alternative, each\navailable act is impermissible. But, of course, this assumes, as noted\nabove, that the act-consequentialist can adopt an intransitive ranking\nof outcomes, which Brown contests.\n\nWhereas pragmatic consequentializing and notational consequentializing\nwill succeed only if the resulting act-consequentialist counterpart\ntheory yields the same set of deontic verdicts that the target\nnon-consequentialist theory yields, earnest consequentializing can\nsucceed even without such perfect coextension (cf. Tenenbaum 2014:\n233). After all, the success of earnest consequentializing requires\nonly that the resulting act-consequentialist counterpart theory is\nbetter overall than both utilitarianism and standard versions of\nnon-consequentialism; it doesn\u2019t require that it can yield all\nthe same deontic verdicts that any plausible non-consequentialist\ntheory can. Given the earnest consequentializer\u2019s goal of coming\nup with an act-consequentialist theory that is more intuitively\ncompelling than both utilitarianism and standard versions of\nnon-consequentialism, they eschew the Footian Procedure. For although\nemploying the Footian Procedure ensures that the resulting\nact-consequentialist counterpart theory will be perfectly co-extensive\nwith the target non-consequentialist theory, it doesn\u2019t\nguarantee that it will be more intuitively compelling than that\nnon-consequentialist theory. For it could be that the\nact-consequentialist would have to accept some very implausible\nrankings of outcomes to ensure its perfect co-extension with the\ntarget non-consequentialist theory. And, as we\u2019ll see below,\nthis is indeed what some philosophers have argued (e.g., Emet 2010 and\nC. Howard 2021).\n\nIn any case, the earnest consequentializer adopts a different\nprocedure for consequentializing: what\u2019s known as the\nCoherentist Procedure (Portmore 2011: 113). On this procedure, we\ndon\u2019t just adopt whatever ranking of outcomes is necessary to\nensure that the resulting act-consequentialist counterpart theory will\nbe perfectly co-extensive with the target non-consequentialist theory.\nInstead, we hold constant the idea that one act is morally better than\nanother if and only if its outcome outranks that of the other while\nrevising, in light of each other and in light of our various\nbackground beliefs, both our pre-theoretical judgments about whether\none outcome outranks another and our pre-theoretical judgments about\nwhether the act that produces the one is morally better than the act\nthat produces the other. And we do this until we reach wide reflective\nequilibrium\u2014a state in which we have arrived at an acceptable\ncoherence among our entire set of beliefs (see Daniels 2003 [2020]).\nAnd it may be that, to reach wide reflective equilibrium, we must\nreject some of the target non-consequentialist theory\u2019s deontic\nverdicts rather than adopt the ranking of outcomes needed to\nconsequentialize them.\n\nAdmittedly, no one has pre-theoretical judgments about the ranking of\noutcomes in the abstract. But these are evaluative rankings,\nand arguably such evaluative rankings concern what the agent ought (or\nwhat it is fitting for the agent) to desire/prefer (see Portmore 2011:\n59\u201362 and 112\u2013114). Hence, the earnest consequentializer\nholds that the judgment that one outcome outranks another is just the\njudgment that the agent ought (or that it is fitting for the agent) to\nprefer the one to the other. And we clearly have judgments both about\nwhich outcomes an agent ought to prefer and about which outcome it\nwould be fitting for them to prefer\u2014but I\u2019ll talk only of\nwhat they ought to prefer in the remainder. Many would, for instance,\njudge both that, if my child has fallen into the sea, I ought to\nprefer that she does not drown and that, if Sergio can rescue only one\nof two groups of people drowning, I ought to prefer that Sergio\nrescues the group that includes my child even if the other group is\nsomewhat larger. And these judgments seem to be independent of our\njudgment about what Sergio ought to do, for we may judge that,\nalthough Sergio ought to save the larger group, I ought, nevertheless,\nto prefer that Sergio saves the smaller group\u2014that being the\ngroup that includes my child. And, in some instances, the Coherentist\nProcedure may call for revising such pre-theoretical judgments. For\nsuppose that the target non-consequentialist theory holds that my\nturning in my daughter to police is morally better than my refraining\nfrom doing so but our pre-theoretical judgment is that I ought to\nprefer the outcome in which I refrain from turning her in to the\noutcome in which I turn her in. In that case, the act-consequentialist\ncounterpart theory must either deny that my turning her in is morally\nbetter than my not doing so (and, thus, give up being perfectly\nco-extensive with the target non-consequentialist theory) or reject\nthe intuitive judgment that I ought to prefer the outcome in which I\nrefrain from turning her in to the outcome in which I turn her in.\nBut, even so, it could be that the resulting act-consequentialist\ncounterpart theory is more intuitively plausible than both\nutilitarianism and standard versions of non-consequentialism.\n\nBut even if the earnest consequentializer doesn\u2019t need to\naccommodate every deontic verdict that every plausible\nnon-consequentialist theory can accommodate, they do need to\nconsequentialize a good number of them. Moreover, they need to do so\nwithout sacrificing whatever the Compelling Idea is. And whether they\ncan do that depends on what the Compelling Idea is. To illustrate,\nsuppose that we take the Compelling Idea to be\n Best Outcome.\n Since the best outcome is the outcome that\u2019s best from what\nSidgwick (1907) described as \u201cthe point of view of the\nuniverse\u201d, it seems that we must abandon this idea if we want to\nconsequentialize certain deontic verdicts, such as those stemming from\nagent-centered restrictions (but see Dougherty 2013; N. R. Howard\n2022; and Setiya 2018 for a contrary position). And this is why many\nearnest consequentializers reject\n Best Outcome\n in favor of\n Best-Relative-to,\n Most Reason to Desire, or\n Reasons for Preferring Ground Deontic Statuses.\n",
