    "main_text": "The DN Model || The Role of Laws in the DN Model\n2.2 The Role of Laws in the DN Model\n\nThe notion of a sound deductive argument is (arguably) relatively\nclear (or at least something that can be regarded as antecedently\nunderstood from the point of view of characterizing scientific\nexplanation). But what about the other major component of the\nDN model\u2014that of a law of nature? The basic intuition\nthat guides the DN model goes something like this: Within the\nclass of true generalizations, we may distinguish between those that\nare only \u201caccidentally true\u201d and those that are\n\u201claws\u201d. To use Hempel\u2019s examples, the\ngeneralization\n\n(1)\n All members of the Greensbury School Board for 1964 are bald\n\n\nis, if true, only accidentally so. In contrast,\n\n(2)\n All gases expand when heated under constant pressure\n\n\nis a law. Thus, according to the DN model, the latter\ngeneralization can be used, in conjunction with information that some\nparticular sample of gas has been heated under constant pressure, to\nexplain why it has expanded. By contrast, the former generalization\n (1)\n in conjunction with the information that a particular person n\nis a member of the 1964 Greensbury school board, cannot be used to\nexplain why n is bald.\n\nWhile this example may seem clear enough, what exactly is it that\ndistinguishes true accidental generalizations from laws? This has been\nthe subject of a great deal of philosophical discussion, most of which\nmust be beyond the scope of this\n entry.[2]\n For reasons explained in\n Section 1,\n Hempel assumes that an adequate account must explain the notion of\nlaw in terms of notions that lie outside the modal\n family.[3]\n He considers (1965b) a number\nof familiar proposals having this\n character[4]\n and finds them all wanting, remarking that the problem of\ncharacterizing the notion of law has proved \u201chighly\nrecalcitrant\u201d (1965b: 338). It seems fair to say, however, that\nhis underlying assumption is that, at bottom, laws are just\nexceptionless generalizations describing regularities that meet\ncertain additional distinguishing conditions that he is not at present\nable to formulate. In subsequent decades, a variety of criteria for\nlawhood have been proposed. Of these the so-called best systems\nanalysis (Lewis 1973) is\nprobably the most popular, but no single account has won general\nacceptance. Finding an adequate characterization of lawhood is thus an\nongoing issue for the DN model. \n\nOne point at which this issue is particularly pressing concerns the\nexplanatory status of the so-called special sciences\u2014biology,\npsychology, economics and so on. These sciences are full of\ngeneralizations that appear to play an explanatory role and yet fail\nto satisfy many of the standard criteria for lawfulness. For example,\nalthough Mendel\u2019s law of segregation (M) (which states that in\nsexually reproducing organisms each of the two alternative forms\n(alleles) of a gene specifying a trait at a locus in a given organism\nhas 0.5 probability of ending up in a gamete) is widely used in models\nin evolutionary biology, it has a number of exceptions, such as\nmeiotic drive. A similar point holds for the principles of rational\nchoice theory (such as the generalization that preferences are\ntransitive) which figure centrally in economics. Other widely used\ngeneralizations in the special sciences have very narrow scope in\ncomparison with paradigmatic laws, hold only over restricted\nspatio-temporal regions, and lack explicit theoretical\nintegration.\n\nThere is considerable disagreement over whether such generalizations\nare laws. Some philosophers (e.g., Woodward 2000) suggest that such\ngeneralizations satisfy too few of the standard criteria to count as\nlaws but can nevertheless figure in explanations; if so, it apparently\nfollows that we must abandon the DN requirement that all\nexplanations must appeal to laws. Others (e. g., Mitchell 1997),\nemphasizing different criteria for lawfulness, conclude instead that\ngeneralizations like (M) are laws and hence no threat to the\nrequirement that explanations must invoke laws. In the absence of a\nmore principled account of laws, it is hard to evaluate these\ncompeting claims and hence hard to assess the implications of the\nDN model for the special sciences. At the very least,\nproviding such an account is an important item of unfinished business\nfor advocates of the DN model.\n",
