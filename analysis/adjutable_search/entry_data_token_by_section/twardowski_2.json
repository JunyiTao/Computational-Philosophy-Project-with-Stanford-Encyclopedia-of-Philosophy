    "main_text": "The Vienna Years: 1891\u20131895 || On the Content and Object of Presentations (1894): Context, Influence and Historical Background\n2.1 On the Content and Object of Presentations (1894): Context, Influence and Historical Background\n\nIn Content and Object, Twardowski shares a number of Brentano's\nfundamental theses. Five of them are particularly relevant here.\nAccording to the first and most important thesis, the essential\ncharacteristic of mental phenomena, and what demarcates them from\nphysical phenomena, is intentionality. We can sum it up as\nfollows:\n\nBrentano's Thesis:\n\nEvery mental phenomenon has an object towards which it is directed.\n\n\nMental phenomena, also called mental acts, fall into three\nseparate classes (second thesis): presentations\n(Vorstellungen), judgments, and phenomena of love and hate. In\nthe mental act of presentation, an object is presented; in a judgment,\njudged; in love and hate, loved or\n hated.[3]\n Next (third thesis), mental phenomena are either presentations or are\nbased on presentations. We need to present an object in order to judge\nit or appreciate it (though we do not need to judge or appreciate an\nobject that we might just present). Importantly, however (fourth\nthesis), a judgment is not a combination of presentations, but a\nmental act sui generis that accepts or rejects the object given\nby the presentation at its basis (see\n Brentano's Theory of Judgment).\n In keeping with this idea, all judgments (fifth thesis) can be aptly\nexpressed in the existential form \u2018A is\u2019 (positive\njudgment) or \u2018A is not\u2019 (negative judgment)\n(alternatively, \u2018A exists\u2019 or \u2018A does\nnot exist\u2019). In both cases, the judgment has a so-called\n\u2018immanent\u2019 object, given by the presentation, which is\nsimply A.\n\nBoth the notion of an object \u2018immanent\u2019 in a mental act,\nas well as, in all generality, the term \u2018object\u2019 in\nBrentano's Thesis, have an ambiguous character. Are the objects of\nmental acts fully inside us or not? To correctly judge that the aether\ndoes not exist means, in Brentanian terms, rejecting the aether which\nis given to one's consciousness by a presentation. But if the aether\nis an object immanent in me, fully inside my consciousness, what does\nit mean, then, that I reject it? Is it some mental entity\ninside my consciousness that I reject? But how could that possibly be\ncorrect? In this case I most certainly have something in my head, and\nthat something exists. So it cannot be correct that I reject\nit\u2014for, if that is the aether I reject, the\njudgment that the aether does not exist cannot be true. The aether\nshould be a physical space-filling substance, outside my\nconsciousness: that is what I am rejecting. But if that is what I\nreject, it seems something must be there for me to be able to affirm\nthat it is not there. This is very puzzling. It was fundamentally due\nto difficulties of this kind that Brentano's theory of judgment was\nsubjected, from 1889 onwards, to continuous objections by philosophers\nsuch as Sigwart and Windelband. Brentano engaged in the debate in his\ndefense, as did his pupils Marty and Hillebrand. It is in this context\nthat Twardowski's Habilitationsschrift was conceived.\nTwardowski saw that notions such as \u2018the object of a\npresentation\u2019 and \u2018immanent object\u2019 were ambiguous\nbecause in Brentano's writings the object of a presentation was\nidentified with that of content of a presentation (Twardowski 1926,\n10). In Content and Object, Twardowski set out to clarify\nexactly the relationship between the two, with far-reaching\nimplications for Brentano's original position.\n\nThe distinction between content and object of a presentation was not\nnew in Twardowski's time. It was the most fundamental element of\nBolzano 1837; it was later present in works of Bolzanian inspiration\n(Zimmermann 1853, Kerry 1885\u20131891; on Zimmermann see Winter\n1975, Morscher 1997, Raspa 1999); and it was also mentioned in works\nof Brentanian inspiration (H\u00f6fler and Meinong 1890, Hillebrand\n1891, Marty 1884\u20131895: article 5, 1894). Nevertheless, the\ndistinction was by no means common lore. In particular, before\nTwardowski, no Brentanian had endorsed the distinction between content\nand object in a way that offered a basis for solving the problems of\nBrentano's theory, nor had anyone among the Brentanians devoted any\nin-depth study to the issue, although the differences between\nBolzano's and Brentano's theories are such that reworking the\ndistinction in a Brentanian framework raises philosophical problems\nthat are by no means trivial. A major difference concerns the role of\nthe content of a presentation and its ontological status, since for a\nBrentanian the content of a presentation can only be something\nactually existing in one's mind. No Brentanian had thus realised in\nfull the implications that reinterpreting the Bolzanian distinction in\na Brentanian key would have. Carrying out this task, and thus helping\nBrentano's theory out of its most pressing troubles, was Twardowski's\noriginal contribution. He drew inspiration from arguments in favor of\nthe content-object distinction present in Bolzano, but he\nreinterpreted them in a Brentanian framework to sustain conclusions\nthat were opposite to Bolzano's and that were new for the Brentanians.\nOne such conclusion, and a major implication of Twardowski's theory of\nintentionality, is that there are no objectless presentations,\npresentations without an object, no matter how strange and improbable\nthat object\n is[4].\n Even presentations of contradictory objects have both content and\nobject. It is this thesis and the conclusions that Twardowski drew\nfrom it that have had a major impact on the development of Brentanian\ntheories of intentionality and that opened the way to ontologies as\nrich as that of Alexius Meinong. On the other hand, this position,\ntogether with Twardowski's identification of meaning with\npsychological content, prompted Husserl's critical reactions and led\nHusserl to the theory of intentionality set out in the Logical\nInvestigations (1900/01) where Twardowski's distinction between\ncontent and object is taken up (on this, see Schuhmann 1993; on\nTwardowski's influence and \u2018triggering effect\u2019 on Husserl,\nsee Cavallin 1990, especially 28f). Twardowski's ideas were not only\ninfluential on the continent. Via G. F. Stout, who published an\nanonymous review of Content and Object, in Mind,\nTwardowski's ideas had an influence on Moore and Russell's transition\nfrom idealism to analytic philosophy (van der Schaar 1996). \n",
