    "main_text": "The Ontology of Fictional Entities || Semantical Arguments for and Against Realism\n2.1 Semantical Arguments for and Against Realism\n\nObviously the important division at the ontological level lies between\nthose who believe that there are fictional\nentities\u2014fictional realists\u2014and those who believe\nthat there are no such entities\u2014fictional antirealists.\nFor a long time, the battlefield between those two parties has been\nordinary language. Realists have always been fascinated by the fact\nthat there are sentences in language that seem to commit one to\nfictional entities. Antirealists have instead insisted that such\nappearances are deceptive: whenever a sentence seems to commit one to\nfictional entities, one can always provide a paraphrase which has the\nsame truth-conditions as the original sentence but is not so\ncommitted. Realists in turn try to show either that those paraphrases\nare inadequate or that there are still further sentences for which no\nadequate paraphrases can be found. Antirealists will reply that,\ndespite appearances, these sentences can also be paraphrased in\nnoncommittal terms; and so the game goes on.\n2.1.1 Russell\u2019s anti-realism\n\nFrege (1892) is often taken to be the first champion of fictional\nantirealism within analytic philosophy, in so far as he held that in\ndirect (gerade) contexts such as \u201cOdysseus came\nashore\u201d the fictional name \u201cOdysseus\u201d has a sense\nbut no reference. But Frege also held that in oblique\n(ungerade) contexts such as \u201cJohn believed that\nOdysseus came ashore\u201d and \u201cThe author of the\nOdyssey says that Odysseus came ashore\u201d this sense\nbecomes the new referent of the fictional name. If senses of this type\ncan model the notion of a fictional entity, then Frege can be\nconstrued as a kind of fictional realist (K\u00fcnne 1990); otherwise,\nhe can\u2019t. (Parsons (1982) is doubtful; Zalta may be more\nsympathetic, since he thinks his abstract objects can model both the\nnotion of sense (Zalta 2001) and the idea of a fictional object.)\n\nThe modern form of the realism-antirealism debate, however, did not\noriginate with anything Frege said on the matter, but with a dispute\nbetween Meinong (1904) and Russell (1905a). Consider a sentence\nlike:\n\n(6) Apollo is\nyoung.\n\n\nAccording to Meinong, considered here as the paradigmatic realist, the\nvery meaningfulness of this statement commits one to a (broadly)\nfictional entity\u2014the deity of the Greek myths\u2014on the\ngrounds, roughly, that the thought expressed by the statement is\ndirected at this entity, and so requires there to be such an entity.\nThe statement itself expresses a truth rather than a falsehood about\nthis entity. For Russell, however, appearances in this case were\ndeceptive. First of all, he thought that \u201cApollo\u201d, like\nany other ordinary proper name, is short-hand for a definite\ndescription\u2014say, \u201cthe sun-god\u201d. Secondly, following\nhis discovery of the theory of definite descriptions Russell held that\na sentence containing a definite description has to be analyzed in\nterms of another sentence in which the description is eliminated in\nfavor of quantifiers, predicates, logical connectives, and genuine\nproper names. What (6) says on this account is given by a paraphrase\nin which the definite description for which \u201cApollo\u201d is\nshort-hand, namely \u201cthe sun-god\u201d, has disappeared on\nanalysis:\n\n(6R) There is\nat least one sun-god and at most one sun-god and every sun-god is\nyoung.\n\n\n(Put more simply: There is a unique sun-god, and he is young.)\n\nThirdly, there is no longer even the appearance of a singular term\n(\u201cApollo\u201d) that must designate something for the\nparaphrase to be meaningful. In fact, Russell saw that this result\nshowed the original statement to be both meaningful (because able to\nbe analyzed in this way) and false (given obvious facts). Say that a\ndefinite description has a Russellian denotation when the\nRussellian conditions for the description to have a denotation are\nfulfilled; that is, when there is at least one individual satisfying\nthe relevant predicate, but no more than one. Then we can say that the\ndefinite description for which \u201cApollo\u201d is short-hand does\nnot have a Russellian denotation since (6R)\u2019s first conjunct,\nnamely:\n\n(7) There is\nat least one sun-god\n\n\nis false. Far from making\n (6)\n meaningless, the absence of a denotation in this Russellian sense\nwhen taken in conjunction with Russell\u2019s eliminative strategy\nshows (6) to be false. Russell thought that his theory of definite\ndescriptions allowed him to show that all fictional names lacked\ndenotation in this way, and that sentences containing fictional names\nwere therefore true or false rather than meaningless.\n2.1.2 Metafictional sentences and \u201cin the fiction\u201d operators\n\nLet us accept, for argument\u2019s sake, that the adoption of\nRussell\u2019s theory of descriptions allows us to avoid ontological\ncommitment to such \u2018bizarre\u2019 entities as nonexistent\nfictional and mythological entities. (Although this is a widely\naccepted view, there is in fact reason to doubt it: David Kaplan\nargues that it is \u201cone of [the] virtues\u201d of\nRussell\u2019s theory that the theory is \u201cessentially neutral\nwith respect to ontological commitment\u201d, that it permits\ndescriptions to denote nonexistent entities if there are such entities\n(Kaplan 2005: 975\u20136; cf. also Voltolini 2006: 139ff.). Even if\nRussell\u2019s theory is ontologically potent in this way, however,\nthe theory as formulated faces a simple and seemingly devastating\nobjection: many intuitively true sentences come out as false\non their Russellian paraphrases. Consider sentence\n (6)\n again. If we use Russell\u2019s theory to dispense with an entity\nlike Apollo, it follows that (6) is false, insofar as its Russellian\nparaphrase is false. This is widely acknowledged to be\ncounterintuitive. Presented with (6), most would say that it is\nintuitively true, unlike, say:\n\n(8) Apollo is\na rock-star.\n\n\nAs it turns out, the antirealist who follows Russell has an easy way\nof circumventing this problem. She will point out that the reason why\n (6),\n but not (8), seems to be true is that in the Greek myth\nthings are exactly as (6) says. The impression that (6) is true can\nthen easily be accommodated by taking (6) to be elliptical for a\nlonger sentence, namely:\n\n(6I)\nAccording to the Greek myth, Apollo is young.\n\n\nHere the locution \u201caccording to the Greek myth\u201d works as\nan intensional operator, whereas the sentence following that operator,\nwhich is nothing but (6) itself, has to be analyzed in Russellian\nfashion:\n\n(6IR)\nAccording to the Greek myth, there is a unique sun-god and he is\nyoung.\n\n\n(A caveat. It would be more proper to say that it is a use of\n (6)\n that is taken to be elliptical for (6IR), rather than (6) itself. For\n(6) is a case of a fictional sentence, namely a sentence that\ncould easily occur in the body of a narrative (a myth, in this case).\nSuch sentences have a use on which they have merely fictional\ntruth-conditions, that is, truth-conditions from the stand-point of\nthe narrative or work of fiction, and on this kind of use even their\ntruth-values are merely fictional. Following Evans (1982), who here\nborrows a Quinean terminology, we may call this the conniving\nuse of such sentences: the use on which the utterer is engaged in\npretense or make-believe. But there is another use of the same\nsentences\u2014what Evans calls the non-conniving\nuse\u2014on which we take them to have real truth-conditions, hence\nreal truth-values: the kind of use on which we take\n (8),\n unlike (6), to express a real falsehood. A case in point would be an\nutterance of (8) in response to a request for information about Apollo\nin an exam on Greek mythology. We shall call sentences of the form\n (6I),\n even reshaped as (6IR), internal metafictional sentences,\nfor they purport to say how things stand in, or according to, a\ncertain fiction. They are meant as sentences that capture the\nnon-conniving use of fictional sentences like (6).)\n\nLet us now go back to the amendment to Russellianism we were\nconsidering. On the view being discussed, an expression like\n\u201caccording to the Greek myth\u201d is, qua intensional\noperator, a circumstance-shifting operator, one that shifts the\ncircumstance of evaluation of the sentence following it. Suppose, for\nthe sake of argument, that a sentence of the form \u201cAccording to\nstory S, p\u201d is true in the actual world if and\nonly if \u201cp\u201d is true at the closest possible\nworlds to the actual world in which S is true (cf. Lewis\n1978). Now, any sentence that this operator embeds has to be analyzed\nin Russellian terms if it contains a singular term. In that case, a\nsentence like\n (6I)\n is true in the actual world if and only if\n (6),\n i.e.,\n (6R),\n is true at the closest possible worlds in which the Apollo-myth is\ntrue. Insofar as (6R) is indeed true at such worlds, the singular term\nin question\u2014\u201cApollo\u201d, that is, \u201cthe\nsun-god\u201d\u2014has a (Russellian) denotation in those worlds,\neven though it lacks a denotation in the actual world. Hence, we again\nget the result Russell desired: the whole sentence is true although\nthe relevant singular term has no actual denotation but only a\npossible one. Thus, no commitment to fictional entities arises out of\nthe truth of that sentence.\n\nOr rather, no such commitment arises from Russell\u2019s theory on\nits own. If we assume Lewis\u2019s modal realism, then saying as we\ndid that a description has a possible denotation entails an\nontological commitment to fictional objects as possibilia.\nNormally, however, this intensionalist approach is taken in an\nantirealist sense (cf., e.g., Lamarque & Olsen 1994; Orenstein\n2003; Rorty 1982). For the Russellian, central to this antirealist\nunderstanding is the fact that a sentence like\n (6I)\n should be given a de dicto, not a de re, reading:\nwhat is said to be true in the fiction is a certain dictum or\nproposition, not the claim, about some given thing or res\nx, that x has a certain property. On Russell\u2019s\nway of understanding this distinction, the description \u201cthe\nsun-god\u201d for which \u201cApollo\u201d is short-hand should be\ninterpreted as having a secondary, not a primary, occurrence in the\nsentence, or, which is the same, the existential quantifier occurring\nin the Russellian paraphrase of the sentence should be assigned\nnarrow, not wide, scope. (6I), that is, should be read as:\n\u201cAccording to the Apollo-myth, there is exactly one sun-god, and\nhe is young\u201d rather than as \u201cThere is a unique sun-god,\nand according to the myth he is young\u201d. The reason for this is\nevident. If we adopt the wide-scope reading of the quantifier, the\nsentence turns out to be false, not true (given that there is no\nsun-god); and it is the truth of a sentence like (6I) that the\nRussellian aims to capture.\n\nSuppose that the Russellian amendment works for fictional sentences on\ntheir non-conniving use. Intuitively, however, there are many\nsentences that talk of fictional characters even though they do not\neven implicitly mention stories. Let us call these\nexternal metafictional sentences (some other commentators\ntalk of \u201ctransfictive\u201d or \u201ccritical\u201d\nsentences).\n (4)\n and\n (5)\n above are typical examples. Clearly, (4) and (5) cannot be taken as\nelliptical for internal metafictional sentences such as:\n\n(4I)\nAccording to the Disney stories, Mickey Mouse is a pop culture\nicon\n(5I)\nAccording to Anna Karenina, Anna Karenina is a fictional\ncharacter.\n\n\nFor unlike\n (4)\n and\n (5),\n the latter sentences are simply false even on their de dicto\nreading (a point already stressed by Lewis (1978: 38)): Mickey Mouse\nhas the status of a pop culture icon in the actual world, not in the\nDisney stories; and according to Anna Karenina, Anna is a\nwoman, not a fictional character. Many realists, especially\ncreationists, have concluded that sentences of this kind really do\nestablish that we are committed to fictional characters. They argue\nthat even though fictional sentences on their non-conniving use can be\nparaphrased as internal metafictional sentences on their de\ndicto reading and thus do not commit us to fictional characters,\nexternal metafictional sentences cannot be paraphrased in this way,\nand their truth really does commit us to fictional characters (see,\nfor example, Schiffer 1996 and Thomasson 2003b).\n\nOne possible antirealist solution to this problem\u2014although not\none that Russellians themselves have promoted\u2014is to invoke a\nkind of fictionalism about fictional characters. On this strategy,\nsentences like (4) and (5) should be thought of as implicitly prefixed\nby another intensional \u201cin the fiction\u201d operator,\nso that even in this case the impression of reference to a fictional\nentity would turn out to be baseless. In cases of this type, the\noperator would appeal not to a story but rather to the realist\npresumption that such an impression seems to support. The suggestion,\nthen, is that external metafictional sentences are to be read as\nimplicitly prefixed by an operator like \u201caccording to the\nfiction of realism\u201d or \u201caccording to the realist\u2019s\nhypothesis\u201d:\n\n(4F)\nAccording to the realist\u2019s hypothesis, Mickey Mouse is a pop\nculture icon.\n(5F)\nAccording to the realist\u2019s hypothesis, Anna Karenina is a\nfictional character.\n\n\nOnce external metafictional sentences are read this way, any apparent\ncommitment to fictional entities seems to disappear, provided once\nagain that the resulting complex sentences are read de dicto\n(for such a move, see Brock 2002, Phillips 2000).\n2.1.3 The descriptivist problem for theories of fictional names\n\nThe appeal to intensional \u201cin the fiction\u201d operators is a\nwell-known strategy for dealing with the apparent truth of statements\nlike\n (6),\n and because it is available to Russell this may seem like good news\nfor Russell\u2019s antirealism, especially given the way the strategy\nmight be extended to external meta-fictional statements like\n (4)\n and\n (5).\n But such an amended version of Russellianism faces a problem already\nfaced by the unamended version of Russell\u2019s view. If such a\nRussellianism is to provide the correct analysis of sentences like\n(6), one has to assume that proper names are synonymous with definite\ndescriptions. This is because the strategy used in arriving at a\nsentence like (6IR) involves replacing a proper name\n(\u201cApollo\u201d) with an equivalent definite description\n(\u201cthe sun-god\u201d). But there are well-known, and widely\naccepted, arguments against such a descriptivist view of proper names\n(Donnellan 1972, Kripke 1972 [1980], 2013). In particular,\ndescriptions of the sort that speakers or communities standardly\nassociate with a name might simply fail to fit what the name really\nrefers to (in the actual world and relative to other possible worlds).\nOne response to this objection as far as fictional names like\n\u201cApollo\u201d, \u201cHolmes\u201d, etc., are concerned is to\nreject descriptivism about ordinary names but endorse it for fictional\nnames (see, for example, Currie 1990: 158\u2013162). On the surface,\nhowever, this looks like an unpromising move: for one thing, it is\npossible to attempt to engage in conversation about Apollo, believing\nhe is real, before coming to the realization that he is merely a\nmythological figure, a possibility that is hard to explain if ordinary\nnames and fictional names have entirely different sorts of\nmeanings.\n\nThis descriptivist problem presents itself as a potential challenge to\nany antirealist view that endorses a de dicto reading of\nsentences like\n (6I)\n and\n (4F)\n /\n (5F).\n For how else, if not in terms of some kind of descriptivist view of\nnames like Russell\u2019s, are we to understand such de\ndicto readings? If names are instead taken to be directly\nreferential\u2014that is, if they are taken to be terms that do not\nsecure their reference by means of descriptive meanings\u2014there\nseems to be no room left for a de dicto as opposed to a\nde re reading of such sentences, and, consequently, no room\nfor the thought that sentences containing (allegedly) empty names like\n\u201cApollo\u201d even have truth-conditions.\n\nA particularly stark form of this dilemma is faced by what is perhaps\nthe most widely accepted post-Kripkean alternative to descriptivism,\nnamely Millianism, which holds that what a name contributes\nsemantically to the propositions expressed through the use of\nsentences containing the name is just the name\u2019s referent. The\ncombination of Millianism and the antirealist view that fictional\nnames like \u201cApollo\u201d lack reference (and so make no\ncontribution to the expression of propositions) appears to imply that\nsentences like\n (6I)\n don\u2019t express any proposition, let alone true propositions.\nThere is now a lively industry devoted to finding Millianism-friendly\nsolutions to this quandary. Some Millians argue that what we see as\nmeaningful and even true concerns what is implicated rather than\nsemantically expressed by such sentences (e.g., Taylor 2000). Others\nappeal to gappy or unfilled propositions. These are proposition-like\nentities expressed by sentences containing empty names that can fail\nto be true because of the gaps (see Braun 1993, 2005; Adams et al.\n1997). Both Braun and Adams et al. argue that such gappiness\ndoesn\u2019t prevent internal metafictional sentences such as\n\u201cIn the Holmes stories, Holmes is a detective\u201d from\nexpressing truths. But they disagree about external metafictional\nsentences like \u201cHolmes is a fictional character\u201d, with\nAdams et al. insisting that these too can be true despite the names\nbeing non-referring, and Braun (2005) arguing that such statements\ncall for a creationist position on which the names in such sentences\nrefer to genuine, created fictional entities.\n\nMillians are not the only ones to have grappled with the implications\nthat the Kripke-Donnellan attack on descriptivism has for the\nsemantics of fictional names. Michael Devitt, for example, another\nearly critic of descriptivism, has used the problem of fictional and\nother empty names to argue against Millianism and in favor of his\nversion of a causal-historical theory of reference (cf. Devitt 1989).\nAnd Mark Sainsbury argues in Sainsbury 2005 that names, including\nfictional names, have singular but non-descriptive meanings that can\nbe specified in a Davidson-style truth theory whose background logic\nis a Negative Free Logic (that is, a logic that counts simple or\natomic sentences containing empty names as false). Given the role\nassigned to Negative Free Logic, it is scarcely surprising that the\ngreatest challenge for such a framework is again the problem of\nexternal metafictional sentences such as\n (4):\n\n(4) Mickey Mouse is a\npop culture icon.\n\n\nThe latter has the appearance of an atomic sentence and so should,\nimplausibly, count as false on such a logic. In (2009) and (2011),\nSainsbury uses the idea of presupposition- / acceptance-relative truth\nto deal with such problems, an idea that is related to ideas found in\nthe popular pretense-theoretic approach to fictional names. That is\nthe approach we turn to next.\n2.1.4 Pretense Theory\n\nFor the antirealist, the semantics of names presents an important\nhurdle to attempts to accommodate the truth of internal and external\nmetafictional sentences featuring fictional names. Such difficulties\nhave suggested the need to look in a completely different direction.\nAs we saw before, it is important to acknowledge the role of pretense\nin fictional talk and writing. A fictional sentence has a conniving\nuse when it is uttered within the context of a certain pretense\ninvolving the telling of a story. Call such a context a\nfictional context. Note that a sentence considered as uttered\nin such a context does in a sense carry ontological commitments: it\ncarries pretend ontological commitments. For within the\ncontext of the relevant pretense, the singular terms involved do refer\nto things. For instance, to utter\n (6)\n in the context of telling the Greek myth is to utter a sentence in\nwhich, from the perspective of the relevant pretense, the name\n\u201cApollo\u201d refers to a god. Consequently, the sentence has\nfictional truth-conditions in that context (the sentence is\ntrue in the world of that context just if the entity referred to as\n\u201cApollo\u201d in that context is young in that world) and has\nalso a fictional truth-value (considered as uttered in that\ncontext, the sentence is true, for in the world of that\ncontext\u2014the world of the Greek myth\u2014there is a god,\nApollo, who is indeed young). Outside that context,\nhowever\u2014that is, in a real context where there is no\npretense that the Greek myth is fact\u2014a name like\n\u201cApollo\u201d refers to nothing. No endorsement of\ndescriptivism is here required. Quite simply, if the singular terms in\nquestion are directly referential (currently the most popular view of\nnames), then a sentence containing a fictional proper name\nwill have no real truth-conditions, hence no real truth-value, since\nany such term is really empty. Take the case of \u201cApollo\u201d,\nwhich on this view has no referent when uttered in a real,\nnon-fictional context of utterance. Assuming it is a directly\nreferential term, it makes no truth-conditional contribution to\nsentences that contain it. Hence, when uttered in a real context (6)\nwill have no truth-conditions, hence no truth-value. (The kernel of\nthis proposal is in Walton 1990; see Recanati 2000 and Everett 2013\nfor refinements.)\n\nSo far, so good. Remember, however, that the intuition that a sentence\nlike\n (6)\n is really, not just fictionally, true\u2014hence, that it has real,\nnot just fictional, truth-conditions\u2014is a powerful one. How can\na pretense antirealist account for this intuition?\n\nAs a first attempt, a pretense antirealist may try to combine the\nvirtues of the pretense account with the virtues of the intensionalist\napproach. That is, she may first stick to the idea that on its\nnon-conniving use a sentence like (6) has to be taken as elliptical\nfor an internal metafictional sentence like\n (6I).\n But she may also insist that the \u201caccording to the story\u201d\noperator should be taken as a context-shifting operator, not\nsimply (like the familiar intensional operator \u201cIt is necessary\nthat\u201d) as a circumstance-shifting operator. That is, she may\ninsist that it is an operator that shifts not only the circumstances\nof evaluation of the sentence it embeds, but also the context relevant\nfor the interpretation of such sentence\u2014typically, the context\nof its utterance. More precisely, if we take a fictional sentence\n\u201cp\u201d on its non-conniving use as elliptical for\n\u201cAccording to the story S, p\u201d, then\n\u201cp\u201d so understood is true in the actual world if\nand only if \u201cp\u201d, taken as uttered in the context\nof the story S (that is, a fictional context), is true in the\nworld of that context.\n\nThe antirealist merits of this account are clear. It allows a proper\nname like \u201cApollo\u201d to be both genuinely empty, carrying no\ncommitment to any fictional entity, but also genuinely\nnon-descriptive. The embedded sentence containing the name ((6), say)\nis understood as being uttered in a fictional context, and in that\ncontext the name directly refers to an individual, the individual\nexisting in the world of the relevant pretense. Since this reference\noccurs only in that fictional context, not in a real context, the name\nreally does remain empty. (This proposal can be traced back to Walton\n1990; see also Adams et al. 1997.)\n\nDespite these virtues, the suggestion faces a well-known criticism.\nKaplan calls such context-shifting operators \u2018monsters\u2019,\nand claims that \u201cnone can be expressed in English (without\nsneaking in a quotation device)\u201d (1989a: 511). In the case of\nindexicals, for example, \u201cno operator can control \u2026 the\nindexicals within its scope, because they will simply leap out of its\nscope to the front of the operator\u201d (1989a: 510). To see how\nthis worry applies to a fictional sentence containing an indexical,\nconsider the famous first line of Proust\u2019s In Search of Lost\nTime:\n\n(9) For a long\ntime I used to go to bed early.\n\n\nWithin the fictional context mobilized by Proust\u2019s telling his\nstory, the first person pronoun \u201cI\u201d refers to the person\nnarrating the events that constitute the imaginary world of\nProust\u2019s Recherche\u2014an individual who exists only\nin that world, not the actual world. Now, suppose we want to capture\nthe sense in which (9) is really true by reporting that the claim\nexpressed by (9) is true according to In Search of Lost Time.\nOn the above pretense-intensionalist approach, we might formulate this\nsuggestion as:\n\n(9PI)\nAccording to In Search of Lost Time, for a long time I used\nto go to bed early.\n\n\nHowever, this equivalence clearly does not work. Assuming that you are\nthe person who utters (9PI), the sentence says that you used to go to\nbed early for a long time in the imaginary world of Proust\u2019s\nRecherche. But this is false, since you are not an inhabitant\nof this world.\n\nIt may be possible to obviate Kaplan\u2019s problem in some way, for\ninstance by claiming that the context-shift affects the whole\nsentence, not just the embedded one (Recanati 2000); but then one has\nto show how such sentences may nonetheless have real truth-conditions,\nand not merely fictional ones. Or the problem may turn out to be\nrestricted to the case of embedded indexicals, or even certain types\nof indexicals. Predelli, for example, has argued that there are\nexamples of discourse about fiction using modal and temporal\nindexicals that are best analyzed in terms of such context-shifting\nKaplanesque \u2018monsters\u2019 (Predelli 2008).\n\nBe that as it may, one might try to simplify the pretense-theoretical\nproposal by reversing the order of explanation. Rather than taking the\nfictional sentence on its non-conniving use as elliptical for an\ninternal metafictional sentence, we might take the internal\nmetafictional sentence to be really true just when the fictional\nsentence (on its non-conniving use) is really true. We might, that is,\nfollow Walton in treating the fictional sentence as\n\u201cprimary\u201d; cf. 1990: 401\u20132). It is in fact\nrelatively easy to discern the sense in which the fictional sentence\non its non-conniving use is really true. It is really true just in\ncase there is a pretense of a certain kind relative to which the\nsentence on its conniving use is fictionally true. In short, the\nfictional sentence is really true on its non-conniving use if and only\nif it is fictionally true (for this formulation, see Crimmins 1998:\n2\u20138). (Walton\u2019s 1990 own formulation of the point is\nweaker, for it gives the proposal a pragmatic twist: by being\nfictionally true, a sentence may be taken to assert, or to\nconvey, a real truth. See also Everett 2013.)\n\nOne advantage of such an antirealist move is that it can be used for\nboth fictional sentences and external metafictional sentences. For\nWalton, what distinguishes the two cases is simply the kind of\npretense that makes the relevant sentence fictionally true. In the\nformer case, the game of make-believe that the relevant fictional\ncontext singles out is an authorized one; that is, it is a\ngame authorized by what serves as a prop in that game (in the case of\na literary game of make-believe, the text written or narrated by the\nstoryteller); the prop dictates how things go in the world of that\ngame. In the latter case, the relevant game of make-believe is an\nunofficial, albeit standard, one (1990: 417); in this case,\nthere may be no constraints\u2014none, at least, provided by the\nprop\u2014that dictate how things stand in the world of that game\n(cf. Walton 1990: 51, 406, 409).\n\nTake (6) again. In order for (6) to be fictionally true, and hence for\nit to be really true on its non-conniving use, the world of the Greek\nmyth must contain a god (Apollo) who is young. This is a consequence\nof the fact that this is the way the myth is told. The myth-telling\nfunctions as a prop constraining how the \u201cApollo\u201d game of\nmake-believe has to be played; a person who makes believe that Apollo\nis a rock-star is not playing the game correctly, or is perhaps\nplaying another game. But now consider\n (4).\n In order for an utterance of (4) to be fictionally true, hence for it\nto be really true on its non-conniving use, it must allude to a game\nin which there is a fictional character named \u201cMickey\nMouse\u201d who has the special property of being a pop culture\nicon\u2014a \u2018Meinongian\u2019 pretense, as Recanati\n(2000) calls it. Now, such a game is not constrained by any text;\nthere is no Mickey Mouse story that describes Mickey Mouse in these\nterms. The game in question is instead one where facts about the\nimportant place occupied in popular culture by the Mickey Mouse\nstories are what make it fictionally true in the game that Mickey\nMouse has the special property of being a pop culture icon.\nTo that extent the game is an unofficial one.\n\nOn this account, then, external metafictional sentences enjoy no\nspecial status; in particular, they don\u2019t provide us with a\nreason for assuming the existence of fictional entities. Our final\nexample returns us to Pirandello\u2019s Six Characters in Search\nof an Author. Consider an utterance of:\n\n(10) The\nFather is a fictional character.\n\n\nOn the one hand, this is an external metafictional sentence of the\nvery same kind as (5), a sentence that the speaker uses to describe\nthe metaphysical status of one of the protagonists of\nPirandello\u2019s work. On the other hand, (10) may also be taken as\na fictional sentence, since Pirandello\u2019s play is characterized\nby the fact that its protagonists are not ordinary concrete\nindividuals but fictional characters. In such a case, the sentence has\ntwo distinct non-conniving uses. On its use as a fictional sentence it\nis allegedly equivalent to:\n\n(10\u2032)\nAccording to Six Characters in Search of an Author, the\nFather is a fictional character.\n\n\nIn this case,\n (10)\n is really true in so far as it is fictionally true relative to a game\nauthorized by the work Six Characters in Search of an Author.\nIn the other case, it is really true in so far as it is fictionally\ntrue relative to an unofficial game in which some entities count as\n\u2018real people\u2019 and some as \u2018fictional\ncharacters\u2019, with the Father correctly singled out as one of the\nlatter because \u2018he\u2019 originated in a work of fiction.\n\nWalton\u2019s pretense-based version of antirealism has been very\ninfluential (for a development of the view, see Everett 2013), but it\nhas also attracted a great deal of criticism. Some have doubted that a\nsentence\u2019s fictional truth on its conniving use can ground a\nsense in which it is really true on its non-conniving use (cf.\nVoltolini 2006), a move that is crucial to his antirealism. Others\nhave doubted that Walton\u2019s appeal to unofficial games of\nmake-believe can yield appropriate antirealist paraphrases for\nmetafictional sentences in general, perhaps because these critics deny\nthat such sentences involve either explicit or implicit appeals to\npretense (Thomasson 1999, van Inwagen 2003).\n2.1.5 Quantificational arguments for realism\n\nOf course, to show that some antirealist paraphrases of\nfictional sentences do not work does not mean that no such\nparaphrases will work. Perhaps it is always possible to find new\nparaphrases that do not raise any of the problems hitherto pointed\nout, whether such paraphrases are based on a new version of the\npretense-theoretic approach or on some other approach. To take this\npoint into account, some realists have pursued a different\nlinguistically-based strategy. To be, as Quine said, is to be the\nvalue of a variable (Quine 1948). Hence if we can locate existentially\nquantified discourse involving quantification over fictional\nentities\u2014either directly, as external metafictional sentences\nthat can themselves be used as premises to derive other metafictional\nsentences, or indirectly, as a result of a valid inference from\nexternal metafictional sentences\u2014then it seems that such\nontological commitment is unavoidable. In this connection, consider\nthe sentence:\n\n(11) There is\na fictional character who, for every novel, either appears in that\nnovel or is a model for a character who does.\n\n\nNot only can such a sentence be inferred from, say:\n\n(12) Sancho\nPanza is a model for at least one character in every novel, apart from\nthe novel Don Quixote, in which he himself\nappears,\n\n\nbut it also legitimizes an inference to:\n\n(13) If no\ncharacter appears in every novel, then some character is modelled on\nanother character\n\n\n(cf. van Inwagen 2000: 243\u20134).\n\nNow, it is certainly true that insisting on the need to preserve the\nvalidity of the above inferences in any account of external\nmetafictional sentences is a good antidote to the antirealist\n\u2018paraphrase\u2019 strategy. For there is no guarantee that\nvalidity is preserved once the above sentences are paraphrased (say,\nin a pretense-theoretic manner \u00e0 la Walton). This\nsuggests that such antirealist paraphrases may not capture the meaning\nof the original sentences, leaving the field to realist construals of\nsuch sentences (cf. again van Inwagen (ibid.); for\nWalton\u2019s response, see Walton 1990: 416ff.).\n\nStill, this may not be enough to show that antirealism should be\nrejected. For while existential sentences like (11) that quantify over\nfictional characters are common enough, there are other existential\nclaims with the same logical features as (11) that philosophers are\nfar less likely to take as evidence of realism. Thus consider:\n\n(14) While\nthere is an imaginary emperor who Nathan Salmon imagined took over\nFrance, there certainly is no imaginary emperor who Nathan Salmon\nimagined took over Canada.\n\n\nThis sentence is suggested by Nathan Salmon\u2019s account of\nallegedly empty names in Salmon 1998. Salmon suggests that while\nfictional names in general stand for abstract created fictional\nentities, certain other terms are thoroughly non-referring or empty.\nIn this connection, he contemplates the possibility of there being an\narmed fanatic who has just taken over the government of France by\ndeclaring himself emperor, and then stipulates that the name\n\u201cNappy\u201d is to refer to whoever is the present emperor of\nFrance if there is such a person (as there would be if this\nimaginative scenario were actual), and to nothing if there\nisn\u2019t. Such a name, he thinks, is clearly empty. Note, however,\nthat in Salmon\u2019s imaginative scenario,\n\n(15) Nappy is\na French emperor\n\n\nis true, but that there is no similar scenario involving a present\nemperor of Canada. A sentence like\n (14)\n is a natural way of recording this fact. But now we face a problem.\nAs Caplan (2004) points out, taking\n (11)\n as an evidence for the genuine existence of what van Inwagen calls\ncreatures of fiction suggests that we should, by parity of\nreasoning, take (14) as evidence for the genuine existence of sui\ngeneris creatures of the imagination. Or, to put the point the\nother way round, if we don\u2019t think that linguistically-based\nreasons such as the availability of an (apparently) true quantified\nsentence like (14) commit us to bizarre entities like Nappy, we should\nnot think that such reasons commit us to fictional entities either.\nFor variants of the problem and complications, see Kroon (2011, 2013,\n2015).\n\nNote that we do not even need quantificational locutions to see the\nproblem. If one thinks that the truth of the external metafictional\nsentence (5) commits us to the existence of a fictional character,\nAnna Karenina, then it is hard to resist the thought that the truth of\nthe non-quantified sentence:\n\n(16) That\nlittle green man is just a trick of the light\n\n\nuttered by someone who wants to describe the mistake made by those\naround him who think that they see a little green man, similarly\ncommits us to the existence of a certain creature of the imagination,\none who has the property of being a trick of the light (cf.\nKroon 1996: 186). Many would resist such an easy road to realism about\ncreatures of the imagination.\n2.2 Ontological Arguments for and Against Realism\n\nThe problems that one thus encounters in trying to let\nsemantic-linguistic arguments ground a commitment to fictional objects\ngive one reason to think that there is no semantical shortcut\navailable to the realist. That is to say, if a realist wants to claim\nthat our prima facie commitment to fictional entities is\njustified, she has to provide a genuine ontological argument to that\neffect.\n\nIn her 1999 book, Thomasson tried to provide just such an argument.\nHer argument claims that we cannot reject fictional objects if we\nadmit fictional works: given that fictional objects and fictional\nworks belong to the same genus of entities (the genus of created,\nartifactual objects) it would be false parsimony to accept the one and\nreject the other.\n\nThis argument has several problems. For one thing, it postulates an\nidentity of kind between fictional works and fictional entities that\nis far from intuitively clear. As Thomasson herself seems to admit\n(1999: 65), fictional works are syntactical-semantic entities, unlike\nfictional entities. But there is a similar argument that does not rely\non a parallelism between fictional works and fictional characters, but\non the fact that the identity conditions of the fictional works refer\nto fictional characters. In brief: if we admit a certain kind of\nentity, we cannot but admit all the other kinds of entities that\nfigure in the identity conditions of such an entity; we admit\nfictional works; so we cannot but also admit fictional objects because\nthey figure in the identity conditions of fictional works (cf.\nVoltolini 2003, 2006).\n\nIf the antirealist wants to challenge the realist on directly\nontological grounds, she has to discredit such arguments, and, better\nstill, provide an argument for the conclusion that there\ncannot be any fictional entities. Curiously enough, Russell,\nwho is usually remembered for having originated the\n\u2018paraphrase\u2019 strategy for eliminating apparent reference\nto nonexistent entities (see 2.11 above), also used\nnon-linguistically-based ontological arguments against admitting such\nentities. In fact, there is good reason to believe that he took his\nmain argument against Meinong to be that Meinongian entities\nare apt to violate the law of noncontradiction (cf. Russell\n(1905a,b)). In his (2005) and (2013), Everett reprises and extends\nRussell\u2019s ontological criticisms so that they become a critique\nof fictional entities in particular. He provides a number of arguments\nthat are intended to show that, first, such entities may violate some\nbasic logical laws\u2014not only the law of noncontradiction, but\nalso the symmetry of identity\u2014and, second, they may be\nproblematically indeterminate with respect to both their existence and\nidentity. These arguments are based on odd but intelligible stories in\nwhich, for example, one individual is both identical to and distinct\nfrom another, or in which it is indeterminate whether a certain\nindividual exists. The link to fictional characters is provided\nthrough certain bridging principles (more refined versions of such\nprinciples are provided in his 2013):\n\n(P1) If the world of a story concerns a creature a, and if\na is not a real thing, then a is a fictional\ncharacter.\n\n(P2) If a story concerns a and b, and if a\nand b are not real things, then a and b are\nidentical in the world of the story if and only if the fictional\ncharacter of a is identical to the fictional character of\nb.\n\nEverett\u2019s critique is interesting and innovative, and (given the\nworries expressed about language-focused arguments) in some ways a\nmodel of how an antirealist should really pursue the battle against\nwhat she believes are ontological illusions. But, not surprisingly,\nthe debate has not ended there. Although at least one influential\n(erstwhile) realist has conceded the power of Everett\u2019s\nargument, proposing an antirealist notion of assumption-relative truth\n(Howell 2011, 2015) in place of the realist absolute notion he\nchampioned earlier (Howell 1979), some other realists think that\nEverett underestimates the conceptual resources available to them.\n\n\nTake, for example, the case that seems to have exercised creationists\nthe most \u2014 the argument for indeterminate identity \u2014 and\nconsider an example like the following made-up nursery rhyme (from\nSchnieder & von Solodkoff 2009: 139):\n\nBah-Tale:\n\nThere once was a man called Bahrooh\n\nThere once was a man called Bahraah\n\nBut nothing determined if Bahraah was Bahrooh\n\nOr if they were actually two.\n\nGiven that \u201cBahraah\u201d and \u201cBahrooh\u201d are\nfictional names, it follows from (P1) and (P2) that it is\nindeterminate whether the fictional character Bahrooh is identical to\nthe fictional character Bahraah, contrary to philosophical consensus\nthat indeterminate identity is incoherent (see especially Evans 1980\nand the ensuing literature).\n\nPhilosophers of fiction have not been slow to respond to this\nargument. Few have been willing to accept fiction-generated ontic\nindeterminacy (Thomasson 2011 and Paganini 2023 are among the\nexceptions). Schnieder & von Solodkoff (2009) suggest that (P2)\nitself is to blame, and that there is a better default principle of\nidentity that lets story-relative ontic indeterminacy suffice for\ndeterminate ontic distinctness. Such a variation on (P2) would block\nBah-Tale from implying ontic indeterminacy, although some, siding with\nEverett, think the variation is ad hoc (Caplan & Muller\n2014). Others challenge the role played by principles of identity. Lee\n(2022), for example, argues that the identity of fictional characters\nis (usually) to be settled by appeal to authorial intentions rather\nthan principles of identity, and that this is enough to disarm alleged\nexamples of ontic determinacy. But even if we stress the importance of\nprinciples of identity, what such principles show may not be all that\nclear. One popular line of argument holds that Everett-style cases\nonly generate semantic, not ontic, indeterminacy (Thomasson 2011,\nCameron 2013, Woodward 2017). Some even think that an appeal to more\nor less familiar neo-Meinongian distinctions between i) predicative\nand propositional negation and ii) modes of predication\n(alternatively, kinds of property) is enough to block the inference to\nontic indeterminacy (Voltolini 2010). Of course, antirealists take\nsuch distinctions to be poorly understood and part of what makes\nrealism an unattractive option in the first place (they may also be\nunusable in complex fiction-involving sentences; see again Everett\n2013; for a reply, cf. Voltolini 2015b)). Hence even if such rebuttals\nare successful on their own terms, this is not likely to settle the\nrealism-antirealism debate.",
