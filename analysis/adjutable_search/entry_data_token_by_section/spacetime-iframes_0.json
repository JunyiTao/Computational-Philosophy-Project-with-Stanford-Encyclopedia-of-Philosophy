    "main_text": "Relativity and reference frames in classical mechanics || The origins of Galilean relativity\n1.1 The origins of Galilean relativity\n\nThe term \u201creference frame\u201d was coined in the\n19th century, but it has a long prehistory, beginning,\nperhaps, with the emergence of the Copernican theory. The significant\npoint was not the replacement of the earth by the sun as the center of\nall motion in the universe, but the recognition of both the earth and\nthe sun as merely possible points of view from which the motions of\nthe celestial bodies may be described. This implied that the basic\ntask of Ptolemaic astronomy\u2014to represent the planetary motions\nby combinations of circular motions\u2014could take any point to be\nfixed, without sacrificing predictive power. Therefore, as Copernicus\nsuggested in the opening arguments of On the Revolutions of the\nHeavenly Spheres, the choice of any particular point required\nsome justification on grounds other than mere successful astronomical\nprediction. The most persuasive grounds, seemingly, were physical: we\ndon\u2019t perceive the physical effects that we would expect the\nearth\u2019s motion to produce. Copernicus himself noted, however, in\nreply, that we can indeed undergo motions that are physically\nimperceptible, as on a smoothly moving ship (1543, p.6). At least in\nsome circumstances, we can easily treat our moving point of view as if\nit were at rest. \n\nAs the basic programme of Ptolemy and Copernicus gave way to that of\nearly classical mechanics as developed by Galileo, this equivalence of\npoints of view was made more precise and explicit. Galileo was unable\nto present a decisive argument for the motion of the earth around the\nsun. He demonstrated, however, that the Copernican view does not\ncontradict our experience of a seemingly stable earth. He accomplished\nthis through a principle that, in the precise form that it takes in\nNewtonian mechanics, has become known as the \u201cprinciple of\nGalilean relativity\u201d: mechanical experiments will have the same\nresults in a system in uniform motion that they have in a system at\nrest. Arguments against the motion of the earth had typically appealed\nto experimental evidence\u2014e.g., that a stone dropped from a tower\nfalls to the base of the tower, instead of being left behind as the\nearth rotates during its fall. But Galileo argued persuasively that\nsuch experiments would happen just as they do whether the earth were\nmoving or not, provided that the motion is sufficiently uniform. (See\nFigure 1.) Galileo\u2019s account of this was not precisely the\nprinciple that we call \u201cGalilean relativity\u201d; he seems to\nhave thought that a system in uniform circular motion, such as a frame\nat rest on the rotating earth, would be indistinguishable from a frame\ntruly at rest. The principle was named in his honor because he had\ngrasped the underlying idea of dynamical equivalence: he understood\nthe composition of motion, and understood how individual motions of\nbodies within a system\u2014such as the fall of a stone from a\ntower\u2014are composed with the motion of the system as a whole.\nThis principle of composition, combined with the idea that bodies\nmaintain their uniform motion, formed the basis for the idea of\ndynamically indistinguishable frames of reference. \n\n\n\nFigure 1: Galileo\u2019s Argument If\nthe earth is rotating sufficiently uniformly, a stone dropped from the\ntower will fall straight to the base, just as a stone dropped from the\nmast of a uniformly moving ship will fall to the foot of the mast. In\nboth cases the stone\u2019s vertical motion will be smoothly composed\nwith its horizontal motion. Hence a sufficiently uniform motion will\nbe indistinguishable from rest.\n\n",
