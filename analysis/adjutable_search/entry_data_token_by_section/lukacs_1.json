Early Writings\n\nLuk\u00e1cs\u2019s early writings\u2014before his turn to Marxism in\n1918\u2014are animated by concerns that are also present, albeit\ntransformed, in his later political thought. In this period,\nLuk\u00e1cs formulates a sophisticated aesthetic theory and critique\nof modern culture, which he diagnoses as being characterized by an\ninsurmountable abyss between objective cultural forms and the richness\nof \u201cgenuine life.\u201d\n\nHe takes up the issue of the relationship between \u201cform\u201d\nand \u201clife\u201d in three different but closely interconnected\ndiscussions. First, there is the question of how the element of\n\u201cform\u201d distinguishes art as a separate sphere of value.\nThis is most explicitly discussed in his two attempts at a systematic\nphilosophy of art. Second, there is the sociological-historical\nquestion about the relation between (individual and collective) life\nand aesthetic and ethical forms in modern bourgeois society. This\ntopic is dominant both in the History of the Modern Drama\n(1909) and in the Theory of the Novel (1916). A third strand\nconcerns existential and ethical questions, most explicitly discussed\nin Soul and Form and in the essay \u201cOn Poverty of\nSpirit.\u201d\n\nAlongside \u201cform\u201d, two central concepts in\nLuk\u00e1cs\u2019s early thought are \u201ctotality\u201d and\n\u201clife.\u201d By \u201ctotality\u201d Luk\u00e1cs means a\nwhole set of elements that are meaningfully interrelated in such a way\nthat the essence of each element can only be understood in relation to\nthe others. \u201cLife\u201d denotes the intrinsic richness and\npotentiality of experiences and actions. Both individual and social\nlife are in principle capable of forming an integrated totality.\nHowever, this is only the case if the essential properties of life\u2019s\nelements are intelligible in terms of their relations to other\nparticulars of life. Luk\u00e1cs claims that this was the case in\nHomeric Greece, where a totality of meaning was immanent to life\nitself. This immanence of meaning and the totality it constituted were\nlost in subsequent historical developments, however, as form became\nexternal to life.\n\nIn regard to the relation between form and life, we can distinguish\nbetween forms that are forms of life itself, produced by that\nlife, and abstract forms which are imposed onto life from the outside.\nWhen a form is imposed on life that is not a form of that specific\nmode of life (or if the form in question cannot be realized in\nempirical life), such an imposition always runs the risk of distorting\nthe meanings of the particular actions or persons. But at the same\ntime, form is necessary for life to become intelligible and unified\n(see Bernstein 1984: 77\u201380). Within the sphere of individual\nagency, persons face this dilemma in regard to the choice of either\nauthentically expressing the particular meanings of their own life,\nrisking the loss of form and, consequently, the loss of intelligible\naccess to these meanings, or of imposing an external form as a\nnormative demand on their life, risking distortion, inauthenticity and\neven the denial of life itself.\n",
