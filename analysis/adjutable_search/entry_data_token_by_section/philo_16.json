    "main_text": "Transcendental Ethics || From passions to virtue\n5.2 From passions to virtue\n\nPhilo\u2019s general vision of mankind is often pessimistic. In\nIos. 30, he uses the Stoic metaphor of the world as a huge\ncity, but a city ruled by violence and hatred. The main cause of this\ndisaster is the reign of passion, a theme very often evoked in the\nphilosophy of his time. In his exegesis of the Biblical passages\nrelating to human errors, Philo uses many philosophical terms and\nmetaphors. Sometimes, he uses a Platonizing description of passion,\nrecalling the description of the winged team of horses in\nPhaedrus 253 c\u2013e. At the same time, in many texts, he\nrefers to the Stoic division of passions, with four bad passions\n(path\u00ea): desire, fear, sadness, and pleasure, and three\ngood passions, joy, caution, and will. But his use of this Stoic\ndivision is not strictly faithful to the original. In his allegorical\ninterpretation of Det. 119\u2013120, Philo contrasts bad and\ngood passions, but he introduces hope and repentance, biblical\nvirtues, among the latter. It was not simply a terminological change,\nbut the sign of a deep ontological change. In Stoic doctrine, only the\npresent exists. To be a sage means to understand that the past and the\nfuture have no real existence, but are mainly spaces of projection for\npassions. By introducing hope and repentance among good passions,\nPhilo, without renouncing a complete, or at least as complete as\npossible, control of bad passions, opened a path going from psychology\nto transcendentalist ethics. \n\nPhilo, without giving a precise and irreversible definition of the\nnature of soul, recommends the radical excision of passions in\nLeg. 3.129, arguing that no moderation of them could be\nsatisfactory. The model is a medical one of major surgery, which will\nalso be used by Seneca. In the fight against passions,\nenkrateia (self-control) and karteria (endurance)\nplay a decisive role. However, only the sage can live without any\npassion in Stoicism, and everyone knows that the Stoic sage is\nextremely rare in the history of mankind. It was impossible for Philo\nto admit that a human being could be perfect. However, it is said in\nDeus 67 that Moses aimed at the disappearance of the\npassions, but did he succeed in it? There are many similarities\nbetween Philo\u2019s attitude towards passions and that of the\nStoics, but there is also a fundamental difference. For him it is\nimpossible to become free from passion without divine Grace. That does\nnot mean that one has to become passive and wait for God\u2019s\nintervention. Enkrateia and karteria are individual\nqualities that are encouraged by the rules of life included in the\nlaws of Moses. However, even before the Law was given to Moses, faith\nwas the condition sine qua non to escape the process of\npassion. When Abraham received the order to sacrifice his son, he\nobeyed without any emotion. \u201cHe admitted no swerving of body nor\nmind\u201d (Abr. 175). His faith was so absolute that at no\nmoment did he try to revolt. But there is yet another difference with\nStoicism. In this doctrine, the sage cannot lose his perfection, and\nhe remains always in his apatheia (perfect serenity) even if\nhe has reflex reactions (propatheiai) of which his judgment\nis not responsible. On the contrary, at the death of Sarah, Abraham\navoids the two attitudes considered erroneous by Philo. He did not\ngrieve over-bitterly nor did he assume indifference\n(apatheia) as if nothing painful had occurred. On this\noccasion, the patriarch chose the metriopatheia, the middle\nway, which, in philosophy, corresponds to Aristotelian doctrine.\nUnlike the Stoics, Philo does not try to present apatheia as\na kind of ethical heroism. Unlike the Peripatetics, he does not think\nthat ethics always requires reasonable aims. He considers the human\nbeing able to transform bad passions into good ones and affirms that\nthere are no natural limits to his perfectibility when he accepts to\nsubmit himself to the power of God.\n",
