    "main_text": "History\n1. History\n\nAttempts to understand the mind and its operation go back at least to\nthe Ancient Greeks, when philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle\ntried to explain the nature of human knowledge. The study of mind\nremained the province of philosophy until the nineteenth century, when\nexperimental psychology developed. Wilhelm Wundt and his students\ninitiated laboratory methods for studying mental operations more\nsystematically. Within a few decades, however, experimental psychology\nbecame dominated by\n behaviorism,\n a view that virtually denied the existence of mind. According to\nbehaviorists such as J. B. Watson, psychology should restrict itself\nto examining the relation between observable stimuli and observable\nbehavioral responses. Talk of consciousness and mental representations\nwas banished from respectable scientific discussion. Especially in\nNorth America, behaviorism dominated the psychological scene through\nthe 1950s.\n\nAround 1956, the intellectual landscape began to change dramatically.\nGeorge Miller summarized numerous studies which showed that the\ncapacity of human thinking is limited, with short-term memory, for\nexample, limited to around seven items. He proposed that memory\nlimitations can be overcome by recoding information into chunks,\nmental representations that require mental procedures for encoding and\ndecoding the information. At this time, primitive computers had been\naround for only a few years, but pioneers such as John McCarthy,\nMarvin Minsky, Allen Newell, and Herbert Simon were founding the field\nof\n artificial intelligence.\n In addition, Noam Chomsky rejected behaviorist assumptions about\nlanguage as a learned habit and proposed instead to explain language\ncomprehension in terms of mental grammars consisting of rules. The six\nthinkers mentioned in this paragraph can be viewed as the founders of\ncognitive science.\n",
