History\n\nAlthough environmental aesthetics has developed as a sub-field of\nWestern philosophical aesthetics only in the last forty years, it has\nhistorical roots in eighteenth and nineteenth century European and\nNorth American aesthetics. In these centuries, there were important\nadvances in the aesthetics of nature, including the emergence of the\nconcept of disinterestedness together with those of the sublime and\nthe picturesque, as well as the introduction of the idea of positive\naesthetics. These notions continue to play a role in contemporary work\nin environmental aesthetics, especially in the context of its\nrelationship to environmentalism. (See also Section 5.1 below.)\n",
