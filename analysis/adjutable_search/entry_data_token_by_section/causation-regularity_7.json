    "main_text": "Inferential Theories of Causation || Ranking Functions\n2.2 Ranking Functions\n\nSpohn (2006, 2012) expounds a broadly Humean analysis of causation.\n\\(C\\) is a cause of \\(E\\) iff\n\n(i)\n\\(C\\) and \\(E\\) occur,\n(ii)\n\\(C\\) precedes \\(E\\), and\n(iii)\n\\(C\\) \u201craises the metaphysical or epistemic status\u201d of\n\\(E\\), given the circumstances of the causal scenario (Spohn 2006:\n97).\n\n\n(iii) says that \\(C\\) is a reason for \\(E\\), given the circumstances.\nThis relation is analysed in terms of ranking functions. Spohn views\nthis analysis as an alternative to counterfactual approaches. At the\nend of this section, we will understand why the analysis qualifies as\nan inferential approach to causation.\n\nSpohn develops the ranking-theoretic analysis in two steps. First, he\nexplains what it is for a proposition to be a reason for another\nproposition. Second, causal relations are characterized as specific\ntypes of reason relations. Let us go a bit further into details. As\nregards notation, we follow Spohn (2006). The notation in Spohn (2012)\nis more refined, but slightly more complex as well.\n\nA ranking function represents a belief state. More specifically, a\nranking function \\(\\kappa\\) assigns each possible world a non-negative\nnatural number such that \\(\\kappa(w)=0\\) for at least one possible\nworld \\(w\\). Intuitively, the rank \\(\\kappa(w)\\) of a possible world\n\\(w\\) expresses a degree of disbelief. \\(\\kappa(w)=0\\) means that the\ndegree of disbelief is zero. \\(w\\) is not disbelieved in this case.\nOtherwise, it is disbelieved with rank \\(\\kappa(w)=n > 0\\). A\nranking function thus defines a Grovian system of spheres, used to\nrepresent AGM belief revision operators (Alchourr\u00f3n,\nG\u00e4rdenfors, & Makinson 1985; Grove 1988). A Grovian system of\nspheres is basically a set of nested sets. At the center of the system\nis its smallest member, a non-empty set of worlds. The smallest set is\nsurrounded by its supersets, as shown in\n Figure 3.\n\n\n\nFigure 3\n\n\nThe ranks 0, 1, 2, 3,\u2026 are understood as cardinal numbers. For\nexample, if world \\(w_1\\) has rank 5 and world \\(w_2\\) rank 10, then\n\\(w_2\\) is disbelieved to a degree twice as much as \\(w_1\\) is\ndisbelieved. Some ranks may even be empty in the sense that there is\nno world that has a specific rank \\(n\\). For example, ranks 3 and 4\nmay be without any possible worlds, while there are possible worlds at\nranks 0, 1, 2, and 5. The cardinal interpretation of the ranks is\nneeded for certain arithmetical operations, such as lifting the ranks\nby a certain cardinal number, applied to all possible worlds of a\ncertain subset. Because of the possibility of empty ranks, a Grovian\nsystem of spheres does not define a unique ranking function.\n\nAt each possible world, either a proposition or its negation is true.\nWe call a world at which a proposition \\(A\\) is true an \\(A\\)-world,\nand identify the proposition \\(A\\) with the set of \\(A\\)-worlds. The\nrank \\(\\kappa(A)\\) of a proposition \\(A\\) is the rank of those\npossible worlds \\(w\\) whose rank \\(\\kappa(w)\\) is minimal among the\n\\(A\\)-worlds. In\n Figure 3,\n the rank of \\(A\\) is thus \\(0\\) and the rank of \\(\\neg A\\) is \\(1\\).\nA proposition \\(A\\) is believed iff \\(\\kappa(\\neg A)>0\\).\n\nRanking functions cannot only be used to express degrees of disbelief,\nbut also to express degrees of belief. This is accomplished by the\nbelief function \\(\\beta\\). Where \\(A\\) is a proposition,\n\n\\[\\beta(A)= \\kappa(\\neg A) - \\kappa(A).\\]\n\n\nThat is, \\(\\beta(A)\\) is the difference between the minimal rank of\nthe \\(\\neg A\\)-worlds and the minimal rank of the \\(A\\)-worlds. For\nexample, if \\(\\kappa(\\neg A)\\) is rather high, we strongly believe\n\\(A\\). \\(\\beta(A)>0\\) means that \\(A\\) is believed to be true, and\n\\(\\beta(A)<0\\) that \\(A\\) is believed to be false. \\(\\beta(A)=0\\)\nmeans that \\(A\\) is neither believed nor disbelieved. In the latter\ncase, we have both \\(A\\)- and \\(\\neg A\\)-worlds whose rank is\nzero.\n\nWe are almost done with the core of ranking theory. It remains to\nexplain conditionalization. Conditionalization of a ranking\nfunction on a proposition represents the belief change upon coming to\nbelieve the proposition. The conditionalization of \\(\\kappa\\) on \\(A\\)\nis defined as follows: \n\n\\[\\kappa(w\\mid A)= \\kappa(w) - \\kappa(A)\\]\n\n\nfor all worlds \\(w\\) at which \\(A\\) is true, while \\(\\kappa(w\\mid A)=\n\\infty\\) for all worlds \\(w\\) where \\(A\\) is false. In less formal\nterms, if our agent comes to believe \\(A,\\) then the ranks of all\n\\(A\\)-worlds are lowered by the rank of \\(A\\). And the rank of all\n\\(\\neg A\\)-worlds is set to infinity, which means that she definitely\ndisbelieves those worlds. The conditionalization of a belief function\n\\(\\beta\\) is defined analogously: \n\n\\[\\beta(B\\mid A) = \\kappa(\\neg B \\: |\\: A) - \\kappa(B \\: |\\: A).\\]\n\n\nThese ranking-theoretic concepts at hand, Spohn defines what it is for\na proposition to be a reason for another proposition. \\(A\\) is a\nreason for \\(B\\) in the context \\(C\\)\u2014relative to\n\\(\\beta\\)\u2014iff \n\n\\[\\beta(B \\: |\\: A \\cap C) > \\beta(B \\: |\\: \\neg A \\cap C).\\]\n\n\nMoreover, he introduces subtle distinctions between an additional, a\nsufficient, a necessary, and a weak reason. These distinctions give\nrise to the notions of an additional, a sufficient, a necessary, and a\nweak cause. We leave out these subtleties for simplicity.\n\nNow that we know what a ranking-theoretic reason is, it remains to\nexplain which types of reasons are causes. In essence, \\(C\\) is a\ndirect cause of \\(E\\) at the possible world\n\\(w\\)\u2014relative to the belief function \\(\\beta\\)\u2014iff\n\n(i)\n\\(C\\) and \\(E\\) are true at \\(w\\),\n(ii)\nthe event expressed by \\(C\\) precedes the event expressed by\n\\(E\\), and\n(iii)\n\\(C\\) is a reason for \\(E\\) in the context \\(K\\), which is given\nby the past of \\(E\\), excluding information about \\(C\\).\n\n\nSpohn thinks that we should understand causation relative to small\nworlds such that the context is given in a certain frame\nof possible events, but not by the global past of \\(E\\). Causation is\nthus doubly relative to an epistemic perspective. First, it is\nrelative to a belief function, and second to a frame of possible\nevents.\n\nA final step is needed to also capture non-direct causal relations.\n\\(C\\) is a cause of \\(E,\\) possibly non-direct, iff the ordered pair\n\\((C,E)\\) is in the transitive closure of the relation of direct\ncausation. That is, \\(C\\) is a cause of \\(E\\) iff there is a sequence\n\\(\\langle C, C_1, \\ldots, C_n, E \\rangle\\) \\((n\\geq 0)\\) such that\neach element of the sequence is a direct cause of the successor (if\nthere is one).\n\nMost notably, the ranking-theoretic account of causation is able to\nsolve the problem of spurious causation, arising from common cause\nscenarios. The solution is quite subtle. Suppose \\(C\\) is a common\ncause of \\(E\\) and \\(F,\\) where \\(F\\) precedes \\(E\\). The crucial\nquestion then is whether or not \\(F\\) is a reason for \\(E\\) in the\ncontext \\(C\\). Spohn (2006: 106) argues that it is not. Recall that\n\\(F\\) is a reason for \\(E\\) in the context \\(C\\) iff \n\n\\[\\beta(E\\mid C \\cap F) > \\beta(E\\mid C \\cap \\neg F),\\]\n\n\nwhere \n\n\\[\\beta(E\\mid C \\cap F)=\\kappa(\\neg E\\mid C \\cap F) - \\kappa( E\\mid C \\cap F),\\]\n\n\nand \n\n\\[\\beta(E\\mid C \\cap \\neg F)=\\kappa(\\neg E\\mid C \\cap \\neg F) - \\kappa( E\\mid C \\cap \\neg F).\\]\n\n\nSpohn determines the difference between the ranks \\(\\kappa(\\neg E \\mid\nC \\cap F)\\) and \\(\\kappa( E\\mid C \\cap F)\\) by the difference in the\nnumber of violations of causal regularities between the world where\n\\(\\neg E \\land C \\land F\\) is true and the world where \\(E \\land C\n\\land F\\) is true. In the former world, the causal regularity between\n\\(C\\) and \\(E\\) is violated, while the causal regularity between \\(C\\)\nand \\(F\\) is respected. No causal regularity is violated in the world\nwhere \\(E \\land C \\land F\\) is true. Hence, \n\n\\[\\beta(E\\mid C \\cap F)=1.\\]\n\n\nAs for the calculation of \\(\\beta(E\\mid C \\cap \\neg F),\\) we have two\nviolations of a causal regularity in the world of \\(\\neg E \\land C\n\\land \\neg F\\), but only one such violation in the world of \\(E \\land\nC \\land \\neg F\\). Hence, \n\n\\[\\beta(E\\mid C \\cap \\neg F)=1.\\]\n\n\nIt therefore holds that \n\n\\[\\beta(E\\mid C \\cap F) = \\beta(E\\mid C \\cap \\neg F).\\]\n\n\nHence, \\(F\\) is neither a reason nor a cause of \\(E\\). It is easy to\nshow that \\(C\\) is a reason for \\(E\\), as desired.\n\nSpohn (2006, 2012) considers a number of further causal scenarios, and\nso he offers ranking-theoretic solutions to the problems of\noverdetermination, trumping, and various scenarios of preemption. The\naccount of overdetermination parallels probabilistic accounts of this\ntype of causal scenario. Spohn does not explicitly address singular\ncausal relations that lack a corresponding regularity. But there might\nbe a way to argue that a collision of the Earth with a huge\nmeteor\u2014at the time when dinosaurs were roaming the\nEarth\u2014raises the ranks of those worlds where dinosaurs are\nalive. Such a raise amounts to believing that dinosaurs could have\ndied because of such a collision.\n\nWhy is Spohn\u2019s analysis of causation inferential? Recall that a\nranking function represents the epistemic state of an agent, which\nimplies that it determines which beliefs are held by the agent.\nMoreover, the conditionalization of a ranking function defines how\nsuch a function changes if the agent comes to believe a certain\nproposition. Hence, conditionalization defines an inference relation\nthat maps a set of propositions to a powerset of propositions. The\nintended meaning of this inference relation is that, if we come to\nbelieve a certain proposition, then it is rational to believe a set of\npropositions. In other words, proposition \\(B\\) is inferable from\nproposition \\(A\\) in the context of a ranking function \\(\\kappa\\) iff\n\\(\\beta(B\\mid A)>0\\), where \\(\\kappa\\) is underlying the belief\nfunction \\(\\beta\\). Put into symbolic notation: \n\n\\[A \\infd_\\kappa B \\;\\text{ iff }\\; \\beta(B\\mid A)>0.\\]\n\n\nThis notation is not used by Spohn (2012), but may be helpful to grasp\nthe inferential nature of Spohn\u2019s condition that a cause must be\na reason for its effect. Notice that \\(\\infd_\\kappa\\) is an\nenthymematic inference relation in the sense that certain premises are\nhidden in the background.\n\nThe inferential nature of the condition that a cause must be a\nranking-theoretic reason for its effect can also be seen from the\nfollowing two results. First, the conditionalization of a belief\nfunction \\(\\beta\\) defines a belief revision scheme (Spohn 1988). Such\na scheme tells us how a rational agent should change his or her\nbeliefs in light of new information (G\u00e4rdenfors 1988). Second,\nany belief revision scheme\u2014in the sense of the AGM theory by\nAlchourr\u00f3n, G\u00e4rdenfors, and Makinson (1985)\u2014defines\na nonmonotonic and enthymematic inference relation (G\u00e4rdenfors\n1991). This result motivates the above definition of the inference\nrelation \\(A \\infd_\\kappa B\\).\n\nSpohn\u2019s theory of causation is first expounded in terms of\nranking functions which model the epistemic states of some agents.\nHowever, it should be noted that Spohn (2012: Ch. 14) aims to spell\nout the objective counterpart to ranking functions. He seeks to\nobjectify ranking functions by saying what it means that a\nranking function represents objective features of the world. The\nnotion of truth may serve as an introductory example. Given \\(w\\) is\nthe actual world, a ranking function \\(\\kappa\\) is an objective\nrepresentation of this world iff \\(\\beta(A)>0\\) for all\npropositions \\(A\\) such that \\(w\\in A\\). (Proposition \\(A\\) is\nconstrued as a set of possible worlds; \\(\\beta\\) is the belief\nfunction of \\(\\kappa\\), as defined above.) This explanation, however,\ndoes not yet capture modal and causal features of our world. And so\nSpohn goes on to explain how modal and causal properties\u2014defined\nby a given ranking function \\(\\kappa\\)\u2014can be understood as\nobjectives features of the world. The details are intricate and\ncomplex. They are spelled out in (2012: Ch. 15); the basic ideas are\nsummarized in Spohn (2018). Suffice it to say that Spohn\u2019s\nobjectification of ranking functions is not only a promising attempt\nfor an objective account of causation and modality, but also a way to\nresolve the tension between an epistemic and non-epistemic theory of\ncausation.\n",
