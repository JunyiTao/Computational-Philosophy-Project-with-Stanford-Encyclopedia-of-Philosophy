    "main_text": "Confucian Feminism: A Hybrid Feminist Theory || Friendship as Spousal Relationship\n7.2 Friendship as Spousal Relationship\n\nReplacing spousal relationship with friendship will enable us to\naddress the many problematics associated with the gender-based\ndivision of labor; furthermore, we will be able to accommodate the\nexpanded institution of marriage to include same-sex couples. This new\nconceptual paradigm of marriage is both Confucian and feminist. It is\nfeminist, since it discards gender-based restrictions/hierarchy in the\ndivision of labor. It is also Confucian, since it utilizes one of the\nfive Confucian social relations (father-son, husband-wife, siblings,\nruler-minister, friends). Friendship is a corridor bridging the\nfamilial and the world at large, in much the same way, marriage serves\nas a pathway through which two strangers become family. The\nidyllically enduring spousal bond till death do us part is also\ncharacteristic of true friendship in good times and bad. In sum,\nfriendship and spousal relationship are not only compatible, but also\noftentimes mirror one another in form and in content.\n\nThe advantage of using our Confucian friendship-based model of\nmarriage is that it provides us with a flexible approach to household\nmanagement and child-rearing as an alternative to the 50/50 equal\nsplit prevalent among liberal feminists (Okin 1989) or the call for\nthe abolition of the institution of family and marriage advocated by\nsome radical feminists (Allen 1984 [1993]; Card 1996, 2007). Compared\nto the liberal 50/50 equal split, the Confucian friendship model is\nmuch more attainable and, unlike the radical call for abolition, the\nConfucian model addresses instead of evading the problems of family\nand marriage. For the vast majority of women (and men) who continue to\nopt to enter the marriage institution and to propagate, the call for\nabolition provides no applicable guidance. Furthermore, the liberal\ntemplate of absolute equality in intimate relationships is not\nattainable since favors done for one\u2019s loved ones are not\nusually tracked on a scoresheet. Nor is this desirable. In a good\nrelationship of any kind, there must be a sense of reciprocity, but\nunlike in a contractual transaction, in a good marriage or friendship,\nreciprocity is not marked by numerical equality.\n\nFor what is especially appealing about friendship is the penetrating\nunderstanding that two good friends have of one another, and that\nfaithful understanding of one another is what enables friends to\ntranscend the temporal needs to repay in kind and in a timely manner\nthat an ordinary dealing in everyday life demands. Friends are\nfaithful to one another, not in a sense of blind obedience, but in a\nway that insists on the enduring goodness in one another, both actual\nand potential. By being faithful to one another in this way, friends\nnot only see what is good in one another, but also help realize what\nelse is possible through thick and thin. Looking at marriage in this\nway, to mandate a 50/50 equal split makes marriage seem not only\ntransactional, but also contrary to what is required in an enduring\nfriendship.\n",
