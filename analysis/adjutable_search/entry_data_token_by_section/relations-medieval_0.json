    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\n\nAll theorizing about relations in the Middle Ages begins with\nAristotle\u2019s short treatise, the Categories. Due to\nhistorical circumstances, this Aristotelian text was one of the very\nfew pieces of ancient Greek philosophy available in the Latin west\nbetween the seventh and twelfth centuries, and the only one to contain\na systematic philosophical treatment of relations. In the\nCategories, Aristotle identifies relations as one of the ten\nhighest kinds or categories (one of the so-called summa\ngenera), and he devotes an entire chapter\u2014the seventh\nchapter of the treatise\u2014to distinguishing its members from those\nof the other categories (most notably, substance, quantity, and\n quality).[1]\n On the standard medieval interpretation of this chapter, Aristotle is\nattempting to characterize relations at least partly on the basis of\nsemantic or logical considerations\u2014that is, on the basis of the\ndifferences between statements containing relational (or\n\u2018relative\u2019) terms and those containing only non-relational\n(or \u2018absolute\u2019) terms. As we shall see, this approach to\ncharacterizing relations helps to shape the way medieval philosophers\nunderstand them, and gives rise to the common medieval distinction\nbetween relations merely according to speech (relationes secundum\ndici) and relations according to nature or being (relationes\nsecundum esse).\n\n\nIn addition to defending a particular characterization of relations in\nthe Categories, Aristotle also suggests a general model or\nparadigm for analyzing what we shall call \u2018relational\nsituations\u2019\u2014that is, the situations or states of affairs\nthat explain the truth of genuinely relational statements. According\nto this Categories model, whenever two (or more) substances\nare related, this is to be explained by certain monadic properties or\naccidents inhering in the\n relata.[2]\n Thus, if Socrates is similar to Theaetetus (i.e., resembles him with\n respect to some\n quality),[3]\n this is not to be explained by an entity to which Socrates and\nTheaetetus are somehow jointly attached (namely, the dyadic or\ntwo-place property, being-similar-to). On the contrary, it is\nto be explained by a pair of accidents, one of which inheres in\nSocrates and relates him to Theaetetus, and the other of which inheres in\nTheaetetus and relates him to\n Socrates.[4]\n\n\nThis Aristotelian model exercises enormous influence during the Middle\nAges, and until at least the fourteenth century, medieval philosophers\ndevelop their own analysis of relational situations in terms of it. In\nthis context, the most important medieval debates concern the precise\nnature of the properties or accidents that relate particular\nsubstances. Some philosophers, such as Peter Abelard and William\nOckham, adopt a form of reductionism, according to which\nthe properties in question are accidents falling under categories\nother than relation. Thus, according to Abelard and Ockham, when\nSocrates is similar to Theaetetus, this is to be explained in terms of\nparticular qualities, say, their respective colors. Other\nphilosophers, however, such as Albert the Great and John Duns Scotus,\nreject this form of reductionism, maintaining instead that relations\nare accidents of a sui generis type. Thus, according to\nAlbert and Scotus, when Socrates is similar to Theaetetus, this is to\nbe explained by a pair of accidents whose members are distinct from,\nand irreducible to, their respective colors.\n\n\nAlthough the analysis of relational situations that Aristotle suggests\nin the Categories is perfectly general, it is clear from his\nlater writings that he does not think that all relational situations\nconform to it. Thus, in the Metaphysics he claims that there\nare relational situations (such as Simmias\u2019s thinking about Socrates)\nin which substances are related not in virtue of a pair of\naccidents, but rather in virtue of a single accident\npossessed by just one of the substances. \u201cAn object of thought\n[e.g., Socrates]\u201d he says at one point \u201cis said to be\nrelated because something else [e.g., Simmias] is related to\n it\u201d.[5]\n And his point just appears to be that some relational situations are\ngrounded in a single property or accident of a single\nrelatum.\n\n\nAristotle\u2019s Metaphysics did not become available to\nphilosophers in the Latin west until the mid-twelfth century, and it\ndid not circulate widely before the thirteenth. Nonetheless,\nphilosophers throughout the medieval period denied that all relational\nsituations conform to the Categories\nparadigm. Unlike Aristotle, however, the basis of the medievals\u2019\ndenial was largely theological in nature. Considerations associated\nwith the doctrine of creation, for example, led them to accept\nrelational situations in which two (or more) substances are related by\na single property or accident. And considerations associated with the\nChristian doctrine of the Trinity forced them to admit that, in\ncertain relational situations, even substances themselves can qualify as\n relations.[6]\n Prior to the fourteenth century, however, these sorts of situations\nwere regarded as special cases, rare exceptions to a general\nrule. Indeed, prior to this time, most philosophers worked hard to\nshow that even these sorts of situations conform, at least to some\nextent, to the paradigm of the Categories. This effort, as we\nshall see, helps to explain the pervasiveness in late medieval\nphilosophy of the distinction between so-called real relations\n(relationes reales) and mere relations of reason\n(relationes rationis).\n\n\nAs the above remarks suggest, the fourteenth century marks an\nimportant turning point in the medieval discussion of relations. After\nthis point, there is a noticeable shift away from the\nCategories paradigm, with the result that many philosophers\ncome to regard those situations in which substances are related by\nvirtue of their accidents as the exception rather than the rule. Part\nof the explanation is due, perhaps, to a gradual waning of\nAristotle\u2019s influence, but part of it is also due to substantive\ndoctrinal changes. By the fourteenth century, it is common to deny the\nexistence of any real distinction between substances and most of their\naccidents, and hence philosophers are increasingly willing to say that\nsubstances themselves provide the ontological grounding for relational\nsituations. Again, due to important semantic innovations around the\nsame time, and the subsequent emergence of late-medieval nominalism,\nphilosophers also begin to depart from the traditional Aristotelian\ncharacterization of relations. Thus, instead of thinking of relations\nas the items responsible for relating two or more substances, they now\nbegin to think of them as items existing only in the mind\u2014that\nis, as mere beings of reason or concepts. With respect to both of\nthese developments, as we shall see, Ockham is an important\ntransitional figure.\n",
