    "main_text": "Immanental Themes and Methods || The Webbed Relations of Language, Experience, Power, and Discourse\n5.4 The Webbed Relations of Language, Experience, Power, and Discourse\n\nPoststructuralist criticism as it studies the webbed relations of\nlanguage, experience, power, and discourse still leaves some open and\nuntheorized space in the links among these terms. Mary McClintock\nFulkerson\u2019s Changing the Subject: Women\u2019s Discourses and Feminist\nTheology (1994), fills those gaps and challenges three inadequate\nnotions of language, gender, and power: (1) the idea that linguistic\nsigns re-present the thing; (2) the Cartesian assumption of the\nsubjective consciousness as the origin of meaning; and (3) the\nunderstanding of power only in terms of external, unidirectional, and\nnegative oppression. Poststructuralist method also critiques the\nliberal logic of inclusion that appeals to \u201cwomen\u2019s\nexperience\u201d or \u201cwomen\u2019s religious experience\u201d as\nthough it is an unproblematic or uncoded content of some kind. All\nsuch strategies and methods, Fulkerson shows, fail to recognize and\naccount for the multiplicity of differences among myriad subject\npositions. In contrast to the liberal humanist goal of accommodating\nas many \u201cdifferent voices\u201d as possible, discourse analysis\nseeks a more radical reading of the ways \u201cvoice\u201d itself is\nproduced and knowledge is power. Taking into account the inextricable\nand multiplicative character of the link between knowledge and the\nsocial relations out of which knowledge emerges changes the question,\nas well as the subject, according to Fulkerson. The question is not,\nfor example, whether a given religious belief system is oppressive or\nliberating to women. Such generic and wholesale frames need to be\nreplaced by more complex appreciation of the construction of multiple\nidentities according to different locations in the social formation of\npatriarchal capitalism.\n\nFleshing out the multiple orderings that create differences in women\u2019s\npositions should result in a clarification of what is at stake in\nappeals to \u201cwomen\u2019s experience\u201d, often taken as a\n\u201csource\u201d and/or \u201cnorm\u201d for feminist thought in\nan earlier generation of texts. Rather than as a \u201ccontent\u201d\nthat is representative of a natural realm of women\u2019s consciousness,\nreligious or otherwise, \u201cwomen\u2019s experience\u201d should be\nunderstood as constructed from \u201cconverging discourses, their\nconstitution by differential networks, and their production of certain\npleasures and subjugations\u201d (Fulkerson, 115) Experience is not\nthe origin of (feminist) philosophy of religion in the sense of\noffering evidence for its claims, but the very reality that needs to\nbe explained. Similarly, in theorizing the link, for example, between\nthe maleness of divine imagery and the legitimation of male dominance,\nwhat needs to be explained is how the maleness of divine imagery gets\ndistributed and interrelated with material realities, and how the\ndiscourse itself carries out the oppression of women.\n\nOnce the false universal of \u201cwomen\u2019s experience\u201d or\n\u201chuman experience\u201d is replaced with an \u201canalytic of\nwomen\u2019s discourses\u201d, feminist philosophers of religion can begin\nto consider the specific productions of positions for women, asking\nsuch questions as: \n\n\nWhat discourses construct the middle-class white churchwoman\u2019s\npositions? The poor Pentecostal woman preacher\u2019s? The liberal academic\nliberation feminist\u2019s? \n\n\nIn her investigations of Appalachian Pentecostal women preachers\u2019\ndiscourse and of the discourse of Presbyterian women\u2019s groups,\nFulkerson sees two very diverse women\u2019s subject positions wrestling\nwith a religious tradition in ways both liberating and constraining.\nApproaching the world of faith as a system of discourses, rather than\nas representational interpretations or cognitive belief claims, she\ndisplays how women\u2019s faith positions can be constitutive of their\nemancipatory practices. The call stories and worship performances of\npoor Pentecostal women ministers, accompanied by ecstatic and bodily\ndisplays of joy, produce particular forms of resistance to patriarchal\nconstraints, just as the faith practices of middle class Presbyterian\nhousewives produce other possibilities for transgression, pleasure,\nand desire.\n\nOne merit of this methodology for feminist philosophy of religion is\nits exposure of the complexity of gender discourse, the constraints\nand resistances found in faith practices, and the social conditions of\nsignification. It creates space in which it is possible to ask what\nphilosophy of religion has occluded from its angle of vision by virtue\nof the abstract and distanced discourse that has characterized it.\n\nOne drawback of poststructuralist accounts of discourse, according to\nsome feminists, is that it rules out the possibility that claims can\nbe validated outside of particular communities and their languages.\nFulkerson appeals to nonfoundationalism, the position that eschews the\nsearch for justifying beliefs or experiences that can in turn support\nother beliefs derived from them. She says that she does not find it\nnecessary to offer reasoned arguments for the faith claims she\ninvokes. The pertinent discursive practices she analyzes are those of\nresistance, survival, agape, and hope\u2014practices, she freely\nadmits, that assume the existence of God rather than problematize it.\nWhat remains an open question for this avenue of feminist philosophy\nof religion is how far discourse analysis can go toward ever\nsubverting the belief structures of Pentecostal women ministers or\nPresbyterian housewives, indeed, how it could even be theoretically\npossible for it to do so.\n",
