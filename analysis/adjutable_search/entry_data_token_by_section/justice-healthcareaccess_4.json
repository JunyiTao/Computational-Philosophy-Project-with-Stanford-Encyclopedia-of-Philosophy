Does Justice Require Universal Access to Health Care?\n\nIn this Section we shall examine three lines of argument that aim to\nshow that universal access to (at least some forms of) health care is\na requirement of justice. If one or more of these views establishes\nits claim, then the practice we have noted in many countries of\nfinancing institutions aimed at providing such access can be construed\nas an effort to meet, however imperfectly, a requirement of justice.\nWe shall not spend time, however, assessing views that deny such\nclaims altogether\u2014noting only that some libertarian accounts of\njustice would reject redistributive efforts to promote health just as\nthey would redistributive efforts to promote other social\nobjectives.\n",
