He\nargued that formal accounts of reduction and explanation are\nimpossible for general theories because they cannot accommodate the\ndevelopment of incommensurable concepts in the course of scientific\nadvance. Feyerabend used the notion of incommensurability to\ncharacterize the relation between two successive fundamental,\nuniversal scientific theories interpreted realistically; i.e. as\npurported descriptions of reality. By limiting incommensurability to\nuniversal theories, Feyerabend meant only those that apply to all\nobjects in the universe. By limiting incommensurability to fundamental\ntheories, Feyerabend meant those that have ontological implications;\ni.e., those that have implications about the very nature of reality.\nUniversal, fundamental scientific theories can be incommensurable only\nif they are interpreted realistically, according to Feyerabend,\nbecause otherwise they cannot compete as the one true theory, and are\nthus not mutually exclusive. By calling two such theories\nincommensurable, Feyerabend meant that they were conceptually\nincompatible: The main concepts of one could neither be defined on the\nbasis of the primitive descriptive terms of the other, nor related to\nthem via a correct empirical statement (1962, 74, 90). As a\nconsequence, it is impossible to reduce incommensurable theories\nformally.\n\nIn 1962, Feyerabend illustrated the incommensurability of scientific\ntheories with a comparison of six pairs of central concepts drawn from\nthree episodes of fundamental theory change in the course of\nscientific advance: (1) The dynamical characterization of impetus in\nthe impetus theory of motion and the concept of force in the\nconceptual apparatus of Newtonian mechanics, (2 & 3) the concepts\nof temperature and entropy in the transition from phenomenological\nthermodynamics to kinetic theory, and (4, 5 & 6) the concepts\nmass, length and time in the transition from Newtonian to relativistic\nmechanics. Feyerabend subsequently added the example of geometrical\noptics and wave optics (1965b, 227). In 1962, Feyerabend also claimed\nthat incommensurability occurs between traditional, fundamental\ntheories in philosophy, and consequently arises in the discussions of\nthe mind-body problem, the problem of the reality of the external\nworld, and the problem of other minds (1962, 31, 90). Feyerabend\nargued that such age-old philosophical problems have not been solved\nbecause the disputants resist the kind of meaning change necessary for\ntheir dissolution. Concepts are incommensurable, according to\nFeyerabend, because they belong to mutually exclusive theoretical\nperspectives. These perspectives are mutually exclusive because they\ngive incompatible accounts of the nature of reality. Feyerabend argued\nthat because the meanings of their terms are provided by the theories\nto which they belong, when there is theoretical change, there are\nmeaning changes (1962, 68, 94). Feyerabend argued that these changes\nin meaning affect our theoretical and observational terms, as well as\nour conception of the nature of reality. When this occurs, there is\nincommensurability; or as Feyerabend later characterized his view:\n\u201ca theory is incommensurable with another if its ontological\nconsequences are incompatible with the ontological consequences of the\nlatter\u201d (1981a, xi). The idea is intended to capture conceptual\nincompatibility due to changes of meaning that occur in theoretical\ntransitions that affect our ontological beliefs. Two fundamental\ntheories are incommensurable because the meanings of their terms are\ndetermined by the theoretical principles that govern their use, and\nthese principles are qualitatively incompatible (1962, 58).\n\nFeyerabend used the idea of incommensurability to attempt to expose a\ndogmatic element that contemporary empiricists share with school\nphilosophies such as Platonism and Cartesianism (from whom empiricists\nhad tried to distance themselves by insisting on an empirical\nfoundation for scientific knowledge). The dogmatic element is due to\nthe assumption that the meanings of empirical terms remain stable\nthrough theoretical transitions; or what Feyerabend called the\nprinciple of meaning invariance (1962, 30). Feyerabend argued that\nthis principle is inconsistent with the existence of incommensurable\nconcepts. Feyerabend drew two main consequences from the insight that\nsome pairs of successive scientific theories are incommensurable.\nFirst, successive scientific theories that are incommensurable have no\nlogical relations: \u201cThe order introduced into our experiences by\nNewton\u2019s theory is retained and improved by relativity. This\nmeans that the concepts of relativity theory are sufficiently rich to\nallow us to state all the facts which were stated before with the help\nof Newtonian physics. Yet these two sets of categories are completely\ndifferent and bear no logical relation to each other\u201d\n(1962, 88\u201389). Because their concepts have different meanings,\nthey cannot be brought into formal logical relations. Second, a\nrevision in the logical empiricist conception of scientific advance is\nrequired. Older theories, and the concepts used to state them, are not\ncorrected and absorbed, and thereby legitimised. Rather, they are\nrejected and replaced, having been falsified. In this way, the logical\nempiricists\u2019 conceptually conservative (or retentive) accounts\nof reduction and explanation are undermined. They cannot accommodate\nthe development of incommensurable concepts in the course of\nscientific advance.\n\nIn 1965, Feyerabend attempted to clarify his notion, claiming that two\ntheories are incommensurable when the meanings of their main\ndescriptive terms depend on mutually inconsistent principles (1965c,\n227; 1975, 269\u2013270, 276). He also claimed that two theories are\nincommensurable if a new theory entails that all the concepts of the\npreceding theory have zero extension or if it introduces rules that\nchange the system of classes itself (1965a, 268). On this account, in\norder for there to be incommensurability, the \u201csituation must be\nrigged in such a way that the conditions of concept formation in one\ntheory forbid the formation of the basic concepts of the other\u201d\n(Feyerabend 1978, 68; cf. 1975, 269; 1981b, 154). Still later, he\nclaimed that with the term \u201cincommensurability\u201d he always\nmeant \u201cdeductive disjointedness, and nothing else\u201d (1977,\n365). These subsequent formulations were all intended to capture the\nsame idea.\n",
