    "main_text": "Moral Objections || Moral Deliberation\n6.1 Moral Deliberation\n\nOne criticism is that theists who accept skeptical theism should\ndeliberate about acting in problematic ways (see Almeida and Oppy\n2003: 505\u20137; Piper 2007: 71ff; Rancourt 2013). More\nspecifically, they should reason that they should never intervene in\npreventing seemingly unjustified evils, even if it would be easy for\nthem to do so. For (as theists) they believe that for any seemingly\nunjustified evil, there is a justifying reason for it. They might fail\nto identify the justifying reason for some seemingly unjustified evil.\nBut (as skeptical theists) they do not regard this failure as\nproviding prima facie justification that the justifying\nreason does not exist. So they should reason that they should not\nintervene in preventing seemingly unjustified evils. But, the\nobjection goes, it is clearly unreasonable\u2014and\nimmoral\u2014to reason that we should never prevent a\npotential seemingly unjustified evil.\n\nThis basic objection can be extended. For instance, theists who are\nskeptical theists frequently believe that they have been commanded by\nGod to act in various ways. Thus, in some concrete situation, a theist\nwho is a skeptical theist may believe both that she should\nnot prevent the suffering (because of her skeptical theism)\nand that she should prevent the suffering (because of her\ntheism). The combination of her views leads to a kind of moral\nparalysis or aporia (see Piper 2007: 72\u20133). (Again, for\nthe reasons mentioned in section IV.3, atheists and theists who are\nnot skeptical theists have straightforward ways of resisting these\nobjections.)\n\nSkeptical theists have offered a number of responses. Some skeptical\ntheists who are theists claim that God has commanded them to act in\nvarious ways. Therefore, when deliberating about how to act, it is\nreasonable to prevent evils since they have been commanded by God to\nprevent evils (compare Bergmann and Rea 2005: 244\u20135, Schnall\n2007). This response requires knowledge or reasonable belief of\nGod\u2019s commands; but some critics of skeptical theism claim that\nskeptical theists who are theists do not have knowledge of God\u2019s\ncommands (see previous section).\n\nOther skeptical theists argue that the objection misrepresents their\nposition (Anderson 2012). Specifically, it neglects a distinction\nWykstra drew (1984: 75\u20136) between different justifications for\npermitting evil (cf. Alston 1991 [1996: 101]). God may be justified in\npermitting an evil because the evil itself is necessary for some\ngreater good. But it may be that God is justified in permitting an\nevil because the possibility of the evil\u2014that is, not preventing\nit\u2014is necessary for some good, such as developing moral\ncharacter. A parenting analogy is apt here. A parent is able to\nprevent an embarrassingly low score on her child\u2019s school work\nby forcing her child to do the homework. But by permitting the\npossibility of that low score, the parent gives her child an\nopportunity to achieve something of value\u2014a more responsible\ncharacter. In this case, the suffering\u2014the embarrassingly low\nscore\u2014is not necessary for any further good; rather, the\nparent\u2019s permission of it is necessary for a further good,\nnamely, increased responsibility. Thus, some skeptical theists reject\nthe claim that for any evil, there is a greater good that outweighs\nthat evil. Rather, God may permit some evil may occur, not because\nthat evil is necessary for some greater good, but because God\u2019s\npermission of it is.\n",
