    "main_text": "The Return\n5. The Return\n\nAfter tawh\u00eed, the remaining two principles of Islamic\nfaith are prophecy (nubuwwa) and the Return\n(ma\u2018\u00e2d), a word that is often translated loosely\nas eschatology. For both philosophers and Sufis, discussion of\nprophecy focused on human deiformity, and the issues they raised led\ntheologians and jurists to accuse them of claiming to be greater than\nthe prophets; Ibn \u2018Arab\u00ee in particular was the center of a\nlong controversy over the relative merits of prophet and saint\n(Chodkiewicz 1993b).\n\nBoth schools of thought also had a great deal to say about the Return,\nwhich was viewed in two respects: compulsory and voluntary. From the\nstandpoint of the compulsory Return, the cosmos unfolds following its\nown ineluctable laws, and human beings go back to God in a series of\nstages that mirror the stages of cosmogenesis. From the standpoint of\nthe voluntary Return, free will allows human beings to play a role in\ndetermining the trajectory of their own becoming. To a certain degree\nthey are co-creators of their own souls and the posthumous realms,\nwhich are experienced in karmic terms, that is, as the result of a\nchain of causality set in motion by their own individual\nunderstandings, character traits, and activities. Ibn\n\u2018Arab\u00ee marks a watershed in the discussion of both sorts\nof Return, not least because his explications of the mundus\nimaginalis allowed him to provide rational arguments for issues\nlike bodily resurrection that, according to Avicenna, could not be\nunderstood by reason but can only be accepted on the basis of faith\n(Avicenna, al-Shif\u00e2\u2019, 347\u201348; Avicenna,\nal-Naj\u00e2t, 3:291). Ibn \u2018Arab\u00ee\u2019s leads\nwere expanded on by later thinkers, most exhaustively by Mull\u00e2\nSadr\u00e2 in the fourth book of his magnum opus, al-Asf\u00e2r\nal-arba\u2018a, on the topic of the soul and its unfolding\n(Mull\u00e2 Sadr\u00e2 2008).\n",
