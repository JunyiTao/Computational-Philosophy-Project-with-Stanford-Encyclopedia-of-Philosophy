    "main_text": "Solidarity in Practice || National Solidarity\n2.3 National Solidarity\n\nThe nineteenth-century nationalist takes over the term from the\nsocialists to describe the unity of a nation in its struggle about\nexternal forces. For the nationalist, solidarity is anchored in shared\nidentification with an \u201cimagined community\u201d where\nmembership is defined not in terms of class or social position, but in\nterms of an underlying way of life characterized by common folkways,\nmores, and a shared history of struggle. In 1882, Ernest Renan claimed\nthat the nation is an expression of a \n\n\ngreat solidarity (une grande solidarit\u00e9), constituted\nby a sense of the common sacrifices that have been made and that one\nis disposed to make again. (Renan 1882: 29)\n\n\n\nAnd Giuseppe Mazzini, whose version of liberal-republican nationalism\nwas to have such a great influence on nationalist movements across the\nworld, writes in 1871:\n\n\nThe individual\u2019s means and his thirty or forty years of adult\nlife are but a tiny drop in the vast Ocean of existence. As soon as he\nbecomes aware of this, he ends up discouraged and abandons the entire\nundertaking. If he is a good man, he will now and again engage in\nsimple charity. If he is evil, he will isolate himself in complete\nselfishness. But give this man a Country [patria] and\nestablish a link of solidarity [solidariet\u00e0] between\nhis individual efforts and the efforts of all subsequent generations;\nplace him in association with the labors of 25 to 30 million men who\nspeak the same language, have similar habits and beliefs, profess\nfaith in the same goal, and have developed specific tools for\ntheir work as required by the general conditions of their land, and\nthe problem will change for him at once: his strengths will be greatly\nmultiplied, allowing him to feel up to the task. (\u201cNazionalismo\ne Nazionalit\u00e0\u201d 1871 [2009: 63])\n\n\nOn this understanding, the nation is understood primarily as a project\nin which each participates over time and across generations. This same\nunderstanding has carried over to contemporary nationalists. For\nthem,\n\na common history, territory, and shared bonds of belonging give rise\nto a commitment to a common project, namely to reproduce and defend\nthe patria. As in workers\u2019 movements, the struggle,\nfurthermore, requires a preparedness to come to each other\u2019s aid\nin realizing the project.\n",
