    "main_text": "Who, or What, Can Dominate? || Can Non-Agents Dominate?\n2.2 Can Non-Agents Dominate?\n\nThat agents alone can be dominated is rarely disputed; but can agents\nalone dominate? What about non-agents like institutions or systems or\nideologies? Vaclav Havel\u2019s (1991: 136\u2013138) example of a\ngrocer in Soviet-era Czechoslovakia recurs in the literature as a\npossible example of domination by a system, where particular agents\nare merely conduits (Lovett 2010; Krause 2013; Blunt 2015). The grocer\nposts slogans favorable to the regime in the window of his shop. By\nposting the slogans, he both signals his cooperation with power and\nextends its reach. Similarly, Sharon Krause (2013: 194) recalls her\nmother\u2019s insistence that she take smaller, more\n\u201cladylike\u201d, steps and overcome her natural stride. Perhaps\nthe ideology Krause\u2019s mother both obeys and enforces is what\ndominates, rather than any particular agent or agents (see also\nFoucault 1975 [1977: 26\u201327]). Workers who have deeply imbibed\nthe values of capitalism might be another example (see Thompson 2013,\n2018): e.g., someone who accepts whatever meaningless work is\navailable because their sense of self-worth depends on not being a\n\u201cslacker\u201d. While it may be that the values of capitalism\nare a social construct produced over time by agents for their own\nbenefit, if what motivates the worker is their own corrupted sense of\nself-worth, it makes sense to think that they might be dominated by an\nideology rather than other agents.\n\nThe central question is whether we can understand possible examples of\ndomination by systems or ideologies as instances of domination\nby agents through systems or ideologies. An\naffirmative answer is more often assumed than argued for in the\nliterature, but Frank Lovett tries to motivate it with this\nexample:\n\n\nImagine a society in which the law of property recognizes the\npossibility of ownership in human beings, but in which it just happens\nthat there are as yet no slaves. After some time, however, slaves are\nimported, and the law duly supports their masters\u2019 rights of\nownership. Later still, the masters repent, and manumit their slaves.\n(2010: 48\u201349)\n\n\nLovett thinks we will agree that domination occurs only during the\nperiod after slaves are imported and before their manumission: the\nlegal system that allowed property in slaves enabled\ndomination but did not dominate.\n\nThe proposed lesson of another thought experiment\u2014this one from\nGwilym David Blunt (2015: 17\u201318)\u2014is that domination without\nagents is conceivable but impracticable, at least in the near term.\nSuppose, a legislator organized a dominating regime and died soon\nafter, but not before programming \u201ca series of automatons\n\u2026 that cannot be reprogrammed\u201d to enforce his will\nagainst a subordinate group in the name of a privileged group. If this\nis domination, it cannot be domination by the deceased legislator (on\nthe assumption that the dead have no agency), or by the automatons\n(who are assumed to be not sophisticated enough to count as agents),\nor by the privileged population (who did not write the laws and cannot\ncontrol the automatons); therefore, it must be the system itself that\ndominates.\n\nIn general, the disagreement about whether agents alone dominate\ntracks the division between theories directly influenced by\nneorepublicans and those descended from other traditions. The\nneorepublican preoccupation with the master/slave relation makes it\nnatural to focus on domination by agents: to be dominated by a master\nis, obviously, to be dominated by an agent. Working from this central\nexample, the republican tradition tends to see institutions, systems,\nand ideologies as sources of power that make mastery possible rather\nthan as standalone sources of domination without agents. If, instead,\nour attention is focused on the ways power can shape the consciousness\nof those under its sway, domination by, e.g., patriarchy itself\nbecomes more plausible, even without the looming presence of\nparticular patriarchs.\n",
