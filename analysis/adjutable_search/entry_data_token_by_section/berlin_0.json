    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\nIsaiah Berlin was born in 1909 in Riga (then capital of the Govenorate\nof Livonia in the Russian Empire, now capital of Latvia), the only\nsurviving child (after a stillborn daughter) of Mendel Berlin, a\nprosperous Russian Jewish timber merchant, and his wife Marie,\nn\u00e9e Volshonok. In 1915 the family moved to the forestry town of\nAndreapol (then in Russia\u2019s Pskov Govenorate), and in 1916 to\nPetrograd (now St Petersburg), where they remained through both\nRussian Revolutions of 1917, which Isaiah would remember witnessing.\nDespite early harassment by the Bolsheviks, the family was permitted\nto return to Riga with Latvian citizenship in 1920; from there they\nemigrated, in 1921, to Britain. They lived first in suburban and then\nin central London; Isaiah attended St Paul\u2019s School and Corpus\nChristi College, Oxford, where he studied Greats (classical languages,\nancient history, and philosophy) and PPE (philosophy, politics and\neconomics), taking Firsts in both. In 1932 he was appointed to a\nlectureship at New College, and shortly afterwards became the first\nJew to be elected to a Prize Fellowship at All Souls, considered one\nof the highest accolades in British academic life.\n\nThroughout the 1930s Berlin was deeply involved in the development of\nwhat became known as Oxford philosophy, or ordinary language\nphilosophy; his friends and colleagues included J. L. Austin, A. J.\nAyer and Stuart Hampshire, all of whom met regularly (with others) in\nBerlin\u2019s rooms to discuss philosophy. However, he also evinced\nan early interest in a more historical approach to philosophy, and in\nsocial and political theory, reflected in his lectures and reviews of\nthe 1930s, as well as in his intellectual biography of Karl Marx\n(1939), still in print, in its fifth edition (2013), over eighty years\nlater.\n\nDuring the Second World War Berlin served in British Information\nServices in New York City (1940\u20132) and at the British Embassy in\nWashington, DC (1942\u20136), where he was responsible for drafting\nweekly reports on the American political scene. For four months in\n1945\u20136 he visited the Soviet Union: his meetings there with\nsurviving but persecuted members of the Russian intelligentsia,\nparticularly the poets Anna Akhmatova and Boris Pasternak, reinforced\nhis staunch opposition to Communism, and had a formative influence on\nhis future intellectual agenda. After the war he returned to Oxford.\nAlthough he continued to teach and write on philosophy throughout the\nlater 1940s and into the early 1950s, his interests had shifted to the\nhistory of ideas, particularly Russian ideas, Marxist and other\nsocialist theories, and the Enlightenment and its critics. He also\nbegan to publish widely-read articles on contemporary political and\ncultural trends, political ideology, and the internal workings of the\nSoviet Union. In 1950, election to a research fellowship at All Souls\nallowed him to devote himself more fully to his historical, political\nand literary interests, which lay well outside the mainstream of\nphilosophy as it was then practised and taught at Oxford. He was,\nhowever, one of the first of the founding generation of Oxford\nphilosophers to make regular visits to American universities, and\nplayed an important part in spreading \u2018Oxford philosophy\u2019\nto the USA.\n\nIn 1957, a year after he had married Aline Halban (n\u00e9e de\nGunzbourg), Berlin was elected Chichele Professor of Social and\nPolitical Theory at Oxford (his inaugural lecture, delivered in 1958,\nwas Two Concepts of Liberty). Later in 1957 he was knighted.\nHe resigned his chair in 1967, the year after becoming founding\nPresident of Wolfson College, Oxford (which he essentially created), a\npost from which he retired in 1975. In his later years he hoped to\nwrite a major work on the history of European Romanticism, but this\nhope was unfulfilled. From 1966 to 1971 he was also a visiting\nProfessor of Humanities at the City University of New York, and he\nserved as President of the British Academy from 1974 to 1978.\nCollections of his writings, edited by Henry Hardy (sometimes with a\nco-editor), began appearing in 1978: there are, to date, fourteen such\nvolumes (plus new editions of four works published previously by\nBerlin), as well as an anthology, The Proper Study of\nMankind, and a four-volume edition of his letters. Berlin\nreceived the Agnelli, Erasmus and Lippincott Prizes for his work on\nthe history of ideas, and the Jerusalem Prize for his lifelong defence\nof civil liberties, as well as numerous honorary degrees. He died in\n1997.\n",
