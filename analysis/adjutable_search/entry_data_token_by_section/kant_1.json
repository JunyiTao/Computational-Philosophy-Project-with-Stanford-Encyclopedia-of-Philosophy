Kant\u2019s project in the Critique of Pure Reason\n\nThe main topic of the Critique of Pure Reason is the\npossibility of metaphysics, understood in a specific way. Kant defines\nmetaphysics in terms of \u201cthe cognitions after which reason might\nstrive independently of all experience,\u201d and his goal in the\nbook is to reach a \u201cdecision about the possibility or\nimpossibility of a metaphysics in general, and the determination of\nits sources, as well as its extent and boundaries, all, however, from\nprinciples\u201d (Axii. See also Bxiv; and 4:255\u2013257). Thus\nmetaphysics for Kant concerns a priori knowledge, or knowledge whose\njustification does not depend on experience; and he associates a\npriori knowledge with reason. The project of the Critique is\nto examine whether, how, and to what extent human reason is capable of\na priori knowledge.\n",
