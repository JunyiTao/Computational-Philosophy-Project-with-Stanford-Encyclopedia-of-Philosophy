    "main_text": "Discourse on scientific method || Scientific method in the court room\n6.3 Scientific method in the court room\n\nPhilosophical positions on the scientific method have also made it\ninto the court room, especially in the US where judges have drawn on\nphilosophy of science in deciding when to confer special status to\nscientific expert testimony. A key case is Daubert vs Merrell Dow\nPharmaceuticals (92\u2013102, 509 U.S. 579, 1993). In this case,\nthe Supreme Court argued in its 1993 ruling that trial judges must\nensure that expert testimony is reliable, and that in doing this the\ncourt must look at the expert\u2019s methodology to determine whether\nthe proffered evidence is actually scientific knowledge. Further,\nreferring to works of Popper and Hempel the court stated that\n\n\nordinarily, a key question to be answered in determining whether a\ntheory or technique is scientific knowledge \u2026 is whether it can\nbe (and has been) tested. (Justice Blackmun, Daubert v. Merrell Dow\nPharmaceuticals; see Other Internet Resources for a link to the\nopinion)\n\n\nBut as argued by Haack (2005a,b, 2010) and by Foster & Hubner\n(1999), by equating the question of whether a piece of testimony is\nreliable with the question whether it is scientific as indicated by a\nspecial methodology, the court was producing an inconsistent mixture\nof Popper\u2019s and Hempel\u2019s philosophies, and this has later\nled to considerable confusion in subsequent case rulings that drew on\nthe Daubert case (see Haack 2010 for a detailed exposition).\n",
