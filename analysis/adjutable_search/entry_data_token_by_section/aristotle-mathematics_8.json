The language and practice of mathematicians is legitimate\nbecause we are able to conceive of perceptible magnitudes in ways that\nthey are not. The only basic realities for Aristotle remain substances,\nhowever we are to conceive them. A primary characteristic of substances\nis that they are separate. Yet we are able to speak of a triangle, a\nfinite surface, merely the limit of a body, and hence not separate, as\nif it were separate (h\u00f4s kekh\u00f4rismenon). It is a\nsubject in our science (in our discourse in the science). The mental\nand logical mechanism by which we accomplish this is the core of\nAristotle's strategy in diffusing platonisms.\n",
