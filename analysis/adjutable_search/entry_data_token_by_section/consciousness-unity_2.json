Many schemes for dividing it up exist in the\nliterature. Tye (2003: 11\u20135), for example, distinguishes object\nunity, neurophysiological unity, spatial unity, subject unity,\nintrospective unity, and, finally, phenomenal unity. The latter is the\nnotion that he explicates in terms of contents being experienced\ntogether, entering into the same phenomenal content, and is the notion\non which he focuses. \n\nSimilarly, Bayne and Chalmers (2003: 24\u20137) distinguish objectual\nunity (a matter of two conscious experiences of one object, so\ndifferent from Tye\u2019s object unity), spatial unity, subject\nunity, and subsumptive unity, the last a matter of two or more\nconscious states becoming aspects of a single conscious state. Then\nwithin subsumptive unity, they distinguish between access unity and\nphenomenal unity. We just examined their definition of the latter. As\nis true of Tye, it is what mainly interests them. Two conscious states\nare phenomenally unified \u201cif there is something it is like for\nthe subject to be in both conscious states simultaneously\u201d. \n\nKant and philosophers in the Kantian tradition break phenomenal unity\ndown. The division usually follows the traditional division of\nexperience into subject, representation, and object or content,\nassigning to each its own form of unified consciousness. Thus there\nwill be unified consciousness of individual objects, of multiples of\nobjects, of acts of experiencing, and of oneself as the subject of\nsuch experiencing. (A fifth form can be distinguished, too, as we will\nsee.) Few contemporary theorists break phenomenal unity down at all,\nso this division is of some interest.\n\nThe first three forms of unified consciousness in the Kantian\ntradition can be expressed in terms of the notion of joint\nconsciousness just introduced. First, unified consciousness of\nindividual objects. This is Tye\u2019s object unity; Bayne and\nChalmers\u2019 objectual unity is at least a related notion. The\nprocess at work here is now commonly called binding (Hardcastle 1998;\nRevonsuo 1999). Binding is the process of tying various features of a\nvisual scene such as colour, shape, edges, and contours, features\ndetected in various places in the visual cortex, together into an\nexperience of a unified, three-dimensional object. Binding may be\nnecessary for consciousness of individual objects but it does not seem\nto be sufficient. We must, it seems, also be jointly conscious of the\nvarious elements to have unified consciousness of an object. \n\nNext, unified consciousness of contents. In unified\nconsciousness of contents, if an experience that one is having\nprovides consciousness of any object or content, then it provides\nconsciousness of other objects or contents and of at least some of the\nitems as a group. Here \u2018object\u2019 and \u2018item\u2019\ncover objects, properties, events\u2014anything of which one can be\nconscious. (We speak of experiences rather than representations in\ndeference to those who doubt that we experience in representations, or\nneed do so: we wish to be neutral on this issue.)\n\nThis distinction between unified consciousness of individual objects\nand of multiples of objects corresponds closely to two kinds of\nsynthesis distinguished by Kant (1781/7, First Division, Book 1,\nChapter 2). Kant distinguishes between the kind of acts of synthesis\nneeded to attain consciousness of individual objects and the kind of\nacts of synthesis needed to attain consciousness of a number of\nobjects at the same time as a single array of objects experienced by a\nsingle subject (Brook 1994: 123). He builds his argument for necessary\ncausal connectedness on the latter.\n\nUnified consciousness of contents appears to be central to our kind of\nconsciousness. For example, suppose that one is conscious of\none\u2019s computer and also of the car sitting in one\u2019s\ndriveway. If consciousness of these two items were not unified, an\nimportant, indeed probably the most important, way of comparing them\nwould not be available. One could not answer questions such as, Is the\ncar the same colour as the WordPerfect icon?, or even, Is the car to\nthe left or to the right of the computer? That is what unified\nconsciousness does for us: it allows us to make such comparisons.\nSince relating item to item in this and related ways is fundamental to\nour kind of cognition, unified consciousness is fundamental to our\nkind of cognition. As we will see in\n Section 4.1,\n there are disorders of consciousness in which this ability to compare\nseems to be lost. These disorders leave people with a massive\ncognitive impairment. \n\nMost theorists outside of philosophy and many within accept that there\nis a second form of conscious unity related to unified consciousness\nof contents, namely, unified consciousness of acts of\nexperiencing. It is present when, for the current acts of\nexperiencing that one is doing, consciousness of one act of\nexperiencing (consciousness of how one is experiencing something, for\nexample seeing it, imagining it, \u2026) provides consciousness of other\nacts of experiencing. (This explication is structured to be neutral as\nto whether unified conscious states include a multiplicity of\nconscious states. We speak of \u2018consciousness of acts of\nexperiencing\u2019 rather than \u2018consciousness of an\nexperience\u2019 for the same reason.)\n\nNot all theorists accept that this second form of unified\nconsciousness exists. Those who promote the so-called transparency\nthesis, the claim that we are not directly conscious of our own\nexperiencings, deny that we have any such form of consciousness\n(Dretske 1995; Tye 2003). Tye, for example, says that when we hear\nsomething, we are not conscious of the auditory experience, just what\nit represents. If one tries to be conscious of the experience, at best\none is aware only of \u201cthe auditory qualities that the experience\nrepresents\u201d (2003: 33).\n\nMany theorists have also had a fourth thing in mind when they speak of\nthe unity of consciousness, namely, unified consciousness of\noneself, the thing that has the experiences. Here, one is or\ncertainly seems to be (see the discussion of Rosenthal in\n Section 3.1)\n conscious of oneself not just as subject but, in Kant\u2019s words\n(A350), as the \u2018single common subject\u2019 of many or all the\naspects of the unified experience that one is now having and of a\nnumber of similar experiences past and, in anticipation, still to\ncome. (Mutatis mutandis, the same holds for the single common\nagent of various bits of deliberation and action.) One has unified\nconsciousness of self when one is conscious of oneself as the single\ncommon subject of experiences of many items in many acts of\nexperiencing. \n\nThe unified consciousness here seems not to be a matter of joint\nconsciousness. When one is conscious of oneself as the common subject\nof one\u2019s current unified acts of experiencing and of unified\nacts of experiencing past and to come, one is not conscious of a\nnumber of objects, nor a number of acts of experiencing either.\n(Indeed, if Kant is right, when one is conscious of oneself as\nsubject, one need not be conscious of oneself as an object at\nall (A382, A402, B429).) However, something similar might be at work.\nOne seems to be conscious of one and the same thing as one and the\nsame thing, namely, oneself, via a number of acts of\nexperiencing.\n\nUnified consciousness of self has been argued to have some very\nspecial properties, for example that the reference to oneself as\noneself by which one achieves consciousness of oneself as subject must\nbe indexical and cannot make use of \u2018identification\u2019\n(Casta\u00f1eda 1966; Shoemaker 1968; Perry 1979). Generalizing the\nlatter notion, it has been claimed that reference to self does not\nproceed by way of attribution of properties or features to oneself at\nall (Brook 2001). One argument for this view is that one is or could\nbe conscious of oneself in the same way as the subject of each and\nevery one of one\u2019s conscious experiences. If so, one would not\nbe conscious of oneself as one kind of thing rather than another. As\nBennett (1974: 80) once put it, consciousness of self would not be\n\u2018experience-dividing\u2019\u2014statements expressing it would\nhave \u201cno direct implications of the form \u2018I shall\nexperience C rather than D\u2019\u201d. And if that is\nso, one\u2019s consciousness of self might not be gained via being\nconscious of features of oneself at all\n\nSome theorists especially in the empirical literature hold that a\nfifth form of phenomenal experience should attract the label,\n\u2018unified consciousness\u2019. We might call it unity of\nfocal attention. It differs from the other forms of unified\nconsciousness that we have delineated. In the others, consciousness\nranges over either many experienced items (unified consciousness of\ncontents), experiencings of many objects (unified consciousness of\nexperiencing), or multiple acts of access to oneself as subject of\nmany experiencings (unified consciousness of self). Unity of focus\npicks out something within these unified \u2018fields\u2019. Wilhelm\nWundt captured what we have in mind in his distinction between the\nfield of consciousness (Blickfeld) and the focus of\nconsciousness (Blickpunkt; Wundt [1874] 1893: Vol. II, 67).\nThe consciousness of a single item on which one is focussing is\nunified because one is conscious of many aspects of the item\nin one state or act of consciousness (especially relational aspects,\ne.g., any dangers it poses, how it relates to one\u2019s goals,\netc.), and of many different considerations with respect to that item\n(one\u2019s goals, how well one is achieving them with respect to\nthis object, etc.), in the same state or act of consciousness. In\nunified focal attention, one integrates a number of cognitive\nabilities and applies them to an object. Bayne and\nChalmers\u2019 objectual unity is a related notion (2003:\n24\u201325). Note that, if there are forms of unified consciousness\ndifferent from focal attention, then, contrary to Posner (1994) and\nothers, attention is not a component of all forms of consciousness\n(Hardcastle 1997). \n\nAll five of the forms of phenomenal unity can, to one degree or\nanother, be attributed to Kant. The first four are clearly Kantian but\nthere is a connection to him even with respect to the fifth. He\ndidn\u2019t speak of attention very often but he did speak of it.\nSee, for example, B156n.\n\nSince Hume ([1739] 1962: 252) and Rosenthal (2003) deny that we have\nsuch unified consciousness of self and Dennett (1991, 1992) says at\nminimum that we have much less of it than we think, it is perhaps\npertinent to say again that in this section we are merely trying to\nsay what the various forms of unity would be like if they exist.\nWhether they do exist is the topic of\n Section 3.\n",
