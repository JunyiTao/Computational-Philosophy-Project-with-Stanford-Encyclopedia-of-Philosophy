    "main_text": "Theories of Unity || The Co-Ownership Theory\n7.4 The Co-Ownership Theory\n\nFinally, there is a model that holds that unity of conscious states\nconsists in their ownership by a single subject, Bayne\u2019s (2004)\nco-ownership. Is co-ownership meant to be necessary, or sufficient, or\nboth? The idea that unified conscious experience must be had by a\nsingle subject could be trivially true, as it would be if the subject\nat a time is just defined as a set of unified contents. For the thesis\nto become interesting, advocates of it would have to offer a richer\nconception of the subject than that. On such a conception, the claim\nthat experiences are had by the same subject would involve\ntheir attribution to the same extra-phenomenal substrate or bearer of\nexperiences, one that can be individuated independently of what is to\nbe found in experience, and thus independently of the notion of a\nunified field of conscious contents. Stated thus, the thesis would not\nbe trivial and may well state a necessary condition of unified\nconsciousness.\n\nHowever, if co-ownership is necessary, is it also sufficient? It seems\nthat is is possible for items that are not unified with one\nanother to be simultaneously presented to one and the same subject.\nThis seems to happen, for example, in split brain cases, or fictional\nvariations thereof\u2014e.g., Parfit\u2019s example of a single\nsubject who is able simultaneously to try out two alternative\napproaches to solving a math problem (1984: 246\u2013248). This state\nof affairs would seem to be a case of parallel but nonunified\nsets of conscious states had by the same subject, in some\ngood sense of the term \u2018same subject\u2019. The same would seem\nto hold of the contents of a subject who switches back and forth\nbetween lobes who lacked memory of earlier contents. If so,\nco-ownership would appear not be sufficient for unity. A\nfortiori, co-ownership would appear not to capture what is\ndistinctive about unified consciousness. Put differently, if\nthere is a requirement here of any kind, more than co-ownership seems\nto be needed. The subject must have a certain kind of relationship to\nthe material. As Kant put it, the material must be something to the\nsubject (A116)\u2014and this requires a subject to whom things can be\nsomething. Mere ownership by itself would appear to fall short (Brook\n1994: 135\u20139, discusses these issues in connection with\nKant).\n\nThought insertion may pose another problem for the co-ownership\nthesis. In thought insertion, the alien states are unquestionably\nco-owned with the avowed ones but there seems to be less than full\nunity of consciousness.\n\nIn\n Section 5.2,\n we examined Kant\u2019s claim that instances of diachronic unified\nconsciousness are able to extend beyond one person (by any criterion\nfor being one person other than unified consciousness). If so,\ndiachronic unity is not sufficient for singleness of person. On the\nstandard account, brain bisection cases suggest roughly the reverse\nclaim about synchronic unity; where there seem to be two instances of\nunity in one body, by many criteria there is just one person\n(remember, there is no question about singleness of person outside the\nlaboratory). If so, singleness of person is not sufficient for\nsynchronic unity. \n",
