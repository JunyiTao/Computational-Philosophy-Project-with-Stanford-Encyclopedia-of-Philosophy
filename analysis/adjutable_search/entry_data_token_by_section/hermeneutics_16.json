    "main_text": "Symbol, Metaphor, and Narrative\n5. Symbol, Metaphor, and Narrative\n\nContemporary hermeneutics receives further contour from Paul\nRicoeur\u2019s considerations of language, and especially of\nlinguistic forms such as symbolism, metaphor, and narrative. Ricoeur\ntakes orientation from the claim of the early Heidegger\u2019s\nhermeneutical phenomenology that self-understanding is, in the end, to\nbe grasped in ontological terms: self-understanding is the\nself-interpretation of human existence, grasped as the enactment of\nthe distinctive possibility of such existence. Ricoeur, however,\nproposes a hermeneutical phenomenology that, as he puts it in an\nimportant early essay, \u2018grafts\u2019 hermeneutics to\nphenomenology in a different manner than Heidegger proposes (Ricoeur,\n\u201cExistence and Hermeneutics,\u201d 6). Heidegger believes that\nfor the self-interpretation of human existence, the interpretations of\nthe human condition found in the human sciences are derivative; what\nis called for is an analysis of the sense of being, or, the structures,\nof human existence as these are disclosed through our own individual\nbeing in the world. Ricoeur criticizes Heidegger\u2019s proposal as a\n\u201cshort route,\u201d or perhaps better, short cut, that bypasses\nthe significance for our self-interpretation of the multiple and even\nconflicting interpretations of the human condition found in other\ndisciplines and areas of philosophy (Ricoeur, \u201cExistence and\nHermeneutics,\u201d 6). He proposes, instead, a hermeneutical\nphenomenology that embraces a \u201clong route\u201d of\nself-interpretation, one that is mediated by passing through\nhermeneutical considerations of these multiple and conflicting\ninterpretations (Ricoeur, \u201cExistence and Hermeneutics,\u201d\n6).\n\nRicoeur\u2019s contributions are notoriously difficult to reduce to a\nspecific position or otherwise categorize, in part because he\npracticed what he preached. In his career, his route to\nself-understanding was influenced by reflexive philosophy, Husserl and\nHeidegger, French structuralism, as well as by contemporary\nAnglo-American philosophy (see Ricoeur \u201cOn\nInterpretation,\u201d 12\u201315). Moreover, his inquiries range\nover topics in areas as diverse as religion, anthropology, psychology,\nhistory, and literature. His contributions to hermeneutics are perhaps\nespecially characterized, however, by the concern for possibilities of\nthe mediating role of language to establish critical distance in\ninterpretive experience and by his focus on the significance of\ninterpretive experience for ethical and political agency.\n\nIn an early formulation of what he has in mind by the hermeneutical\n\u2018long route\u2019 to self-understanding, Ricoeur maintains that\nthe pursuit of self-understanding has to be mediated by hermeneutical\nconsiderations of semantic structures of interpretation that are\ncommon to research across the human sciences (Ricoeur,\n\u201cExistence and Hermeneutics,\u201d 11). In this,\nRicoeur\u2019s approach is \u201corganized around the central theme\nof meaning with multiple or multivocal senses\u2026\u201d or, what\nhe calls \u201csymbolic senses\u201d (Ricoeur, \u201cExistence\nand Hermeneutics,\u201d 11). This involves a novel conception of\ninterpretation itself. Traditionally in hermeneutics, the purpose of\ninterpretation is thought of as making apparent the single, unitary\nmeaning of something. Ricoeur, by contrast, stresses that the aim of\ninterpretation also includes making apparent the plurality of meanings\nat issue in a speech act or text. He writes,\n\u201cInterpretation\u2026is the work of thought which consists in\ndeciphering the hidden meaning in the apparent meaning, in unfolding\nlevels of meaning implied in the literal meaning\u201d (Ricoeur,\n\u201cExistence and Hermeneutics,\u201d 13).\n\nRicoeur explains that the itinerary of the hermeneutical long route to\nself-understanding passes through an analysis of a broad range of\nsymbolic forms, such as the \u201ccosmic\u201d symbolism revealed by\nthe phenomenology of religion, the symbolic character of\n\u201cdesire\u201d revealed by psychoanalysis, and the symbolic\nforms revealed by the study of literature and the arts (Ricoeur,\n\u201cExistence and Hermeneutics,\u201d 13). In his Freud and\nPhilosophy: An Essay on Interpretation, Ricoeur describes Freud,\nalong with Nietzsche and Marx, as a master of the \u2018hermeneutics\nof suspicion.\u2019 In this, interpretation, as a \u2018deciphering\nof hidden meaning in the apparent meaning,\u2019 takes on a critical\nfunction through the exposure of repressed or distorted meaning that\nlies beneath the surface of commonly accepted meaning.\n\nLater in his career, Ricoeur\u2019s considerations of the\nhermeneutical long route to self-understanding shift attention from a\nsemantics of symbols to considerations of metaphor and especially\nnarrative. Ricoeur\u2019s considerations of metaphor build from the\nclaim that metaphor should be grasped not first as the substitution of\none conventional name for a different one, but, instead, as a\n\u201cpeculiar predication,\u201d one \u201cconsisting in the\nattribution to logical subjects of predicates that are incompossible\nwith them\u201d (Ricoeur, \u201cOn Interpretation,\u201d 8).\nCrucial for Ricoeur is that metaphorical predication thus not only\nconcerns what Frege called \u2018sense\u2019 but also\n\u2018reference.\u2019 Metaphors are linguistic innovations that\nallow us to refer to aspects of reality for which words are otherwise\nunavailable (Ricoeur, \u201cOn Interpretation,\u201d 10).\n\nRicoeur maintains that narrative, too, concerns both sense and\nreference, but on a different scale. By narrative, he has in mind\n\u201cthe diverse forms and modes of the game of storytelling\u201d\n(Ricoeur, \u201cOn Interpretation,\u201d 2) and in his three-volume\ntreatise Time and Narrative, he focuses on the role of\nnarrative not only in literary fiction but also in the recounting of\nhistory. He argues that while there are a diversity of forms and modes\nof narrative, all narratives nevertheless perform a common function,\nnamely, they mark, organize, and clarify temporal experience (Ricoeur,\n\u201cOn Interpretation,\u201d 2). In this, he claims that in\nnarrative the work of such schematization of temporal experience is\nachieved by the composition of the plot, or, emplotment. Through\nnarrative emplotment, we make apparent the meaning of persons,\nrelations, and events that comprise human affairs\u2014say, in\nfiction, those that can happen, and in history, those that have\nhappened. Crucial for Ricoeur is that narrative emplotment is\nreferential; as he makes the point in regard to fiction, \u201cthe\nplots we invent help us to shape our confused, formless, and in the\nlast resort mute temporal experience\u201d (Ricoeur, \u201cOn\nInterpretation,\u201d 6).\n\nRicoeur maintains, however, that the referential function of narrative\nis not simply to assert something about the world but has implications\nfor ethical and political life. In fiction, narrative emplotment not\nonly helps us evaluate the meaning of human actions, but, moreover,\ncontributes to the creation of \u201cthe horizon of a new relating\nthat we may call a world\u201d (Ricoeur, \u201cOn\nInterpretation,\u201d 10; see also Ricoeur, \u201cImagination in\nDiscourse and Action\u201d). In so doing, fiction refers to\npossibilities of reality that can orient our agency and contribute to\nour efforts to reshape reality.\n",
