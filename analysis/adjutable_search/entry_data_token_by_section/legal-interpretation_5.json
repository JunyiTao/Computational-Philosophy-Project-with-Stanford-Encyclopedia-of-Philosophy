Overview of Methods of Legal Interpretation\nThis section provides a brief overview of several well-known methods of legal interpretation. The goal is to introduce readers to standard formulations, not to offer in-depth analysis of what the methods actually come to. The section therefore sketches the way in which proponents typically gloss their methods, without attempting to look behind these characterizations.\n\nTextualism\nTextualists give priority in statutory and constitutional interpretation to the relevant texts.[13] Textualism is typically formulated in opposition to intentionalism or purposivism, as it rejects the search for legislative intentions or more general statutory purposes \u2013 at least to the extent that they are not enacted in the text. If the meaning of a text is taken to be clear, textualists reject the appeal to other sources to modify or depart from that meaning, even when the meaning of the text seems to be in tension with apparent legislative purposes. (Eskridge 1990, 686; Scalia 1997, 17\u201323; Manning 2001, 7, 17; 2006, 92\u201393, 110\u201311). A prominent feature of contemporary textualism is a rejection of appeals to legislative history, which textualists regard as unreliable and manipulable (Scalia 1997, 29\u201337; Scalia and Garner 2012, 376\u201378; Easterbrook 1990, 448\u201349; 1994, 65; 2017, 90\u201391; Manning 2011, 123\u201324).\nIntentionalism\nIntentionalists maintain that the primary or exclusive role of the interpreter is finding the intentions of the enacting legislature or of the constitutional framers or ratifiers (Bork 1971; Alexander and Prakash 2004; Knapp and Michaels 2005; Fish 2005; 2008; Michaels 2009; Alexander 2013). Although the meaning of the text is an important guide to the relevant intentions, intentionalism contemplates that other evidence of intentions, including legislative history, may override the evidence of the text. The discussion of intentionalism below will distinguish between several kinds of legislative intentions that are frequently conflated in the legal interpretation literature. These distinctions yield several kinds of intentionalism. See below section 4.1.\n\nPurposivism\nOne important strand of intentionalism has come to be called purposivism. According to the seminal account, interpreters should \u201cdecide what purpose ought to be attributed to the statute and to any subordinate provision of it which may be involved\u201d on the assumption that the legislature consisted of \u201creasonable persons pursuing reasonable purposes reasonably.\u201d (Hart and Sacks 1994, 1374, 1378). This formulation makes clear that the relevant purpose is not a psychological state of any actual person or body, but an \u201cobjectified\u201d purpose that is imputed to the provision based on an idealization (though some writers understand purposivism as making an empirical assumption about actual intentions). (On \u201cobjectified\u201d intentions, see section 4.1.) For purposivists, the meaning of the words is to be subordinated to, and interpreted in light of, the purpose of the provision.\nOriginalism\nOriginalism comprises the family of theories of constitutional interpretation that give primacy to some aspect of the Constitution at the time it was ratified. This original aspect is variously taken to be the intentions of the framers or ratifiers of the Constitution, the meaning of the text, the way in which the text would have been understood by the ratifiers of the Constitution, or well-established practices at the time.[14] See entry on Constitutionalism. Originalism thus includes both intentionalist and non-intentionalist theories of interpretation. What the various forms of originalism have in common is their taking the correct interpretation of the Constitution to be fixed by a particular feature of the Constitution at the time of ratification. It promotes clarity to frame this core idea in terms of the Constitution\u2019s contribution to the content of the law (though originalists do not always do so): that contribution is fixed by the relevant aspect of the Constitution at the time of ratification and does not change thereafter.\nThe intentionalist approach to constitutional interpretation, which takes the relevant aspect of the Constitution to be the framers\u2019 or ratifiers\u2019 intentions, flourished for a time in the second half of the 20th century (fading in the 1980s), but, in recent decades, originalists have shifted their focus to original meaning (see Whittington 2013, 379\u201382; Kesavan and Paulsen 2003, 1134\u201348). Contemporary originalism tends to focus on \u201coriginal public meaning,\u201d by which originalists mean, roughly speaking, the way in which reasonable readers of the Constitution would have understood its meaning at the time it was ratified. See section 4.2 below.\nNew Originalism\nA prominent camp of public meaning originalists are the new originalists (Whittington 2004; 2013; Barnett 1999; 2013; Solum 2010; 2013a; 2013b; 2015; see also Goldsworthy 1997).\nIn addition to the focus on public meaning, as mentioned in the previous section, a characteristic position of the new originalists is an emphasis on \u2013 in their vocabulary \u2013 a distinction between \u201cconstitutional interpretation\u201d and \u201cconstitutional construction.\u201d As the new originalists draw this distinction, constitutional interpretation involves ascertaining the \u201cpublic meaning\u201d of the Constitution at the time it was ratified. (On \u201cpublic meaning,\u201d see section 4.2.) Constitutional construction, as defined by some of the new originalists, involves constitutional adjudication in cases where the original meaning \u201cruns out,\u201d \u201cfails to provide a unique rule of law,\u201d or does not \u201cdictate a unique application\u201d. Barnett 2013, 619; 1999, 645\u201346; Whittington 1999a, 7. In such cases, the new originalists think that \u201can act of creativity beyond interpretation\u201d \u2013 \u201cthe construction of meaning\u201d \u2013 is required. Whittington 1999a, 7. Solum (2010) and Barnett (2011) draw the distinction importantly differently, taking constitutional construction to be the ascertaining of the \u201clegal effect\u201d of a provision, including both its contribution and its application to particular cases (see Berman and Toh 2013 564\u201370).\nNon-originalism\nNon-originalism and living constitutionalism are terms used for positions that deny that the proper interpretation of the Constitution is fixed at the time of ratification (e.g., Eisgruber 2001; Breyer 2005; Strauss 2010). See entry on Constitutionalism. Aleinikoff 1988 and Eskridge 2005 are examples of non-originalist theories of statutory interpretation.\nNotice that it is consistent with some versions of originalism that the correct application of constitutional norms may be different from the way in which the Constitution was originally intended and expected to apply. In one kind of case, the correct application of the Constitution changes over time as a result of changes in circumstances. The commerce clause, for example, specifies that Congress shall have power over \u201ccommerce among the several states\u201d (U.S. Constitution, Article I, section 8, clause 3). If the relevant original aspect of the Constitution is the meaning of the words or the framers\u2019 intention about what legal rule to adopt (on such intentions, see section 4.1), then, without any change in constitutional law, changes in the country\u2019s economy may have the effect that types of businesses that were formerly not within the scope of Congress\u2019s power over interstate commerce may now be within the scope of the power. (Greenberg and Litman 1998).\nIn a second kind of case, original intentions about the application of a provision were based on beliefs now understood to be false. If the relevant original aspect of the Constitution is, say, the rule that the framer\u2019s intended to enact, the correct application of the Constitution will be governed by the best understanding of what falls under that rule, not the original false beliefs. To take a simple example, consider someone who, at the time of ratification, was believed to be ineligible to be president because he was incorrectly believed to have been born in a foreign country and therefore not \u201ca natural born Citizen\u201d (U.S. Constitution Article II, section 1, clause 5). In this case, the way in which the provision was originally understood to apply was incorrect even at the time of ratification (Whittington 2013, 384).\nDespite this point, it is common to classify a theory as non-originalist if it allows that the application of the Constitution should be governed by the best available understanding of what falls under broad language of the Constitution \u2013 especially when that language includes moral terms. For example, a theory that allows that punishments not considered cruel at the time the Constitution was ratified may violate the eighth amendment because they are in fact cruel would standardly be considered a non-originalist theory. See entry on Constitutionalism, section 9. Such a position is, however, consistent with the Constitution\u2019s contribution to the law\u2019s being fixed by the original linguistic meaning of the text or by certain kinds of original intentions (see Whittington 2004, 610\u201311). There is thus an anomaly in the use of the originalism and non-originalism labels: positions that meet the definition of originalism given by its own proponents are standardly treated by both sides of the debate as non-originalist (see Eisgruber 2001, 27).\nBecause non-originalism is simply defined as the denial of originalism, it does not pick out a distinctive method of interpretation, but encompasses several different positions. For example, common-law constitutionalism holds that courts develop constitutional law based on a body of precedents and past practices in much the same way that they develop common law (Strauss 1996; 2010; Waluchow 2007). I now turn to several other non-originalist positions \u2013 Ronald Dworkin\u2019s view, pluralism, and pragmatism \u2013 that also apply to statutory interpretation.\nDworkin\u2019s Law as Integrity\nRonald Dworkin\u2019s influential work yields a distinctive account of legal interpretation. Two points are critical to an understanding of Dworkin\u2019s contribution. First, Dworkin begins from a general theory of creative (as opposed to conversational and scientific) interpretation \u2013 one that encompasses, for example, literature, art, and non-legal social practices (1986, 50-51). According to this theory, an interpreter tries to show the object of interpretation in its best light, all things considered, by imposing a point or purpose on it. The best interpretation of an object is the one that makes it the best of its type or genre that it can be. (Dworkin 1986, chapter 2). Dworkin uses the term constructive interpretation for this distinctive type of interpretation (Dworkin, 1986, 52).\nSecond, Dworkin\u2019s law as integrity theory is primarily a theory of law \u2013 of how the content of the law is determined (metaphysically) \u2013 rather than a theory of legal interpretation. (See the entry on legal interpretivism.) According to law as integrity, the content of the law is constituted by the best constructive interpretation of the legal system (as well as more specific consequences that follow from those principles) (Dworkin 1986, chap. 7). Thus, Dworkinian constructive interpretation figures centrally in his account of what determines the content of the law. Dworkin further argues that the best interpretation of the legal system is the set of principles that best fits and justifies the legal practices, including constitutional provisions, statutes, regulations, and judicial decisions (1986, chaps. 4\u201310). And he offers a well-known account of the dimensions of fit and justification (1986, especially chapter 7).\nThus, despite the importance of interpretation in Dworkin\u2019s work, his focus is on the theory of law, not on legal interpretation as it is understood here. He seems to take for granted that there is little or no space between a theory of law and a theory of legal interpretation. (On the issue of how such theories may come apart, see section 5.2.) Consequently, he assumes that, if he is right that the content of the law is constitutively determined by constructive interpretation, then the best way to ascertain a provision\u2019s contribution is to ask which principles best fit and justify the enactment or ratification of the provision.\nDworkin\u2019s work has inspired other theories of constitutional interpretation. A notable example is Sager\u2019s (2004) justice-seeking theory of constitutional interpretation.\nPluralism\nJudges, lawyers, and legal academics are commonly pluralists, relying on many different kinds of sources, methods, and modes of reasoning, including, for example, textual analysis, purposive reasoning, consideration of historical sources, precedent-based reasoning, forward-looking assessment of consequences, and appeals to moral values such as fairness, democracy, and rule of law (e.g., Fallon 1987; Eskridge and Frickey 1990; Breyer 2005; see Berman 2018, 1341\u201342).\nPhilip Bobbitt, the best-known pluralist theorist of constitutional interpretation, distinguished six modalities of constitutional argumentation. These include, for example, structural, ethical, and prudential argumentative modalities. (Bobbitt 1982; 1991). Bobbitt\u2019s work is neither merely descriptive of existing practice, nor based on a larger underlying theory, e.g., of what determines the content of the law. Instead, Bobbitt takes constitutional practices generally to legitimate the use of the different modalities, though in some instances he offers criticisms of existing practices (Bobbitt 1982; 1991).\nPluralism is probably the approach to interpretation employed by a majority of practitioners and legal academics (though often not under that name). (See Berman 2011, 413\u2013414; Griffin 1994, 1758\u201361.) (It is more difficult to say whether it is the most commonly endorsed approach among scholars who explicitly theorize about statutory and constitutional interpretation.) [15]\nAn obvious question for pluralism is how to resolve conflicts between different interpretive sources and methods. For the most part, pluralist theorists have not tried to give a rigorous answer to this question (Berman 2011, 414; Griffin 1994, 1764\u201365; but see Berman 2018).\nPragmatism\nPragmatism is most prominently associated with Judge Richard Posner (Posner 1998; 2003; 2008).[16] The basic idea is to resolve cases in the way that produces the best results. Constitutional provisions, statutes, judicial decisions, and the like are relevant only to the extent that paying attention to them will yield better results. According to Posner, pragmatism seeks \u201cthe best decision having in mind present and future needs, and so does not regard the maintenance of consistency with past decisions as an end in itself, but only as a means for bringing about the best results in the present case\u201d (Posner 1998, 238).\nAlthough the pragmatist judge will take into account authoritative texts, he or she does not regard them as binding, but merely as factors that are relevant to what will produce the best results. Given this emphasis on producing the best results going forward, pragmatism gives more weight to empirical matters, including both the specific facts of the controversy and empirical \u2013 especially economic \u2013 theory than to the authoritative texts (Posner 1998, 238\u2013241). Pragmatism\u2019s attitude towards legal rights and duties thus bears comparison with consequentialist approaches to moral rights and duties. (See the entry on consequentialism.)\nPragmatism as I have explicated the position is almost never endorsed by judicial opinions and has few advocates among theorists of legal interpretation, though, as Berman (2011, 415) notes, some pluralists who emphasize the importance of results, classify themselves as pragmatists (e.g., Eskridge and Frickey 1990).\nThis chapter will focus on a few of the positions sketched above, especially textualism, intentionalism, purposivism, and original public meaning originalism. One reason for this focus is that the debate between textualism and intentionalism or purposivism has dominated recent theoretical discussion in the statutory field. And, in the constitutional field, originalism has set the terms of debate. (As explained below, original intent originalism will be included in the discussion of intentionalism and public meaning originalism will be included in the discussion of textualism.) Space constraints do not permit in-depth exploration of all of the positions in the field, and the focus adopted here provides a natural and topical way of introducing many of the fundamental issues concerning legal interpretation.\n",
