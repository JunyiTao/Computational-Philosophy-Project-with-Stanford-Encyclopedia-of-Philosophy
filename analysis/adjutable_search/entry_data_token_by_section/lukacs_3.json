    "main_text": "Early Writings || Neo-Kantian Aesthetics\n2.2 Neo-Kantian Aesthetics\n\nWhile Luk\u00e1cs\u2019s cultural criticism seeks to capture\ndistinctively modern phenomena, its claims are backed up by an\naesthetic theory that aims to discover transcendental conditions of\nthe aesthetic that are immune to historical variability. Even though\nLuk\u00e1cs\u2019s early work draws on Georg Simmel\u2019s theory of\nculture and on the Nietzschean idea of an intrinsic tension between\nlife and form, its central anchoring point is a Neo-Kantian framework\n(for a detailed discussion of the influence of Emil Lask in\nparticular, see Kavoulakos 2014). This framework is most clearly\nevident in his two systematic attempts to produce a philosophy of art\nin Heidelberg (GW 16 and 17). Here, Luk\u00e1cs seeks to\nprovide a philosophical explanation of the conditions of the\npossibility of art that takes the work of art as the\nfundamental locus of aesthetic meaning, rather than deriving this\nmeaning from either artistic creation or aesthetic experience.\n\nIn his early aesthetic thought, Luk\u00e1cs\ndistinguishes\u2014taking up Neo-Kantian terminology\u2014between\ndifferent spheres of reality. The most immediate sphere is the\n\u201creality of experience,\u201d in which everything appears as an\nobject of qualitative experience, or (in the 1916 version) as having a\ngiven object character (Gegenst\u00e4ndlichkeit) that is\nfundamentally heterogeneous. Luk\u00e1cs envisages two arguments\nconcerning the role that art can play in relation to this sphere: in\nthe 1912 Philosophy of Art, he argues that any adequate\ncommunication of meaning between people must appear impossible from\nwithin the experiential sphere, since the infinite qualitative\nparticulars of experience cannot ever be successfully communicated.\nHowever, the desire to communicate meaning drives people to adopt\ndifferent means of communication that, although inadequate for\nexpressing the reality of experience, enable them to overcome their\nseparateness by relating to each other in terms of other spheres of\nreality (for example, the sphere of logical validity). While logic and\nethics constitute \u201cpure\u201d spheres of communicable meaning,\nhowever, the categories of the aesthetic cannot be fully separated\nfrom experience.\n\nIn the 1916 Aesthetics, Luk\u00e1cs adopts a more radical\nversion of this Neo-Kantian argument: whereas the reality of everyday\nlife is characterized by a heterogeneity of forms of objects, the\naesthetic sphere of validity is characterized by a distinct form of\nobjectivity that is legislated as a norm by experience\nitself. Thus, the contrast between everyday life and art is not one\nbetween experience and validity but one between the heterogeneity of\neveryday life and the homogeneous form that is appropriate to the\nautonomy of experience (GW 17: 36). Consequently, in\ncomparison to the logical and ethical spheres of validity, aesthetics\nhas a distinct status. While in these other spheres of validity\nobjective norms and subjective attitudes are fully separable, the\nautonomy of experience legislates a normative standard that involves a\nspecific relationship between subjective experience and objective\nnorm.\n\nThe value that defines the aesthetic sphere, Luk\u00e1cs claims, can\nonly be derived from the concept of the work of art since this concept\nis presupposed by all descriptions of artistic production or aesthetic\nexperience. Even though neither production nor reception is\nconstitutive of the value of works of art, they can still serve as a\nbasis for reconstructing the independent normative status of\naesthetics. The result of this analysis is a conception of the work of\nart as an ideal homogeneous unity of form and material. In\nthe 1912 Philosophy of Art, this unity is characterized in\nterms of the experiential content\u2019s becoming completely communicable\nand containing all possible aspects of a possible experience, thus\nforming a \u201cconcrete totality\u201d (GW 16: 83, 91, 112\nand GW 17: 110) of its own world within itself. By contrast,\nin the 1916 Aesthetics, it is brought about through a process\nin which the constitutive function of experience becomes completely\nautonomous, determining both form and content. Such an ideal work of\nart is, in virtue of this harmony, a Utopian fulfillment of the\nattitudes that are already operative in the ordinary world of\nexperience (GW 16: 82).\n\nWorks of art therefore present us with an \u201cimmanent\nutopia\u201d of experience, that is, with the vision of a form of\nexperience that is ordered and unified by a constitutive\n\u201cstandpoint\u201d (GW 16: 82) such that form and\ncontent are completely appropriate for each other. Because of these\nfeatures, such an experience embodies a maximum of objectivity in the\nsubject\u2019s relation to an object that is completely appropriate to\nits subjectivity (GW 17: 100). This finally answers the\nquestion regarding the a priori conditions of art: as an\nideal of a particular kind of possible experience, the work of art is\nalways historically specific. However, both the potential to\nbecome a totality in virtue of their form and the normative\ndemand to do so are timeless, a priori conditions of\nthe possibility of works of art in the Neo-Kantian sense (GW\n16: 168).\n",
