Philosophers and scientists have debated the\nrelative merits of these methods for understanding animal minds. A\ncentral method in ethology is fieldwork on wild animals, for instance,\nwhile experimental psychology relies primarily on laboratory studies\non captive animals. Wild and captive animals often lead different\nkinds of lives. For example, captive chimpanzees tend to have regular\naccess to food, extensive experience with human objects (including\nobjects designed for enrichment), and live in a relatively small\nspace. Wild chimpanzees typically live in territories that are many\nsquare kilometers in size, spend much time foraging, and must overcome\nlife-threatening problems not typically found in captivity, such as\ncompetition with neighboring groups and predators (Boesch 2022). In\ncomparative cognition, many researchers stress the importance of\nobserving animals in their natural environment. From an ethological\nperspective, this is crucial for understanding how animal minds\nevolved because \u201cit is in this situation that natural selection\nacts\u201d (Healy & Hurly 2003: 326).\n\nOther researchers note that control conditions like those found in the\nlaboratory are necessary for investigating animal minds. For example,\nHeyes and Dickinson (1990) argue that identifying the mental states\nresponsible for a given action requires determining\n\n\nwhat the animal would have done if its circumstances had been\ndifferent in certain, specifiable respects from those in which the\naction actually occurred. (1990: 88; but see Allen & Bekoff 1997:\nchapter 9)\n\n\nObserving animals in their natural environment often precludes varying\nthe environment in systematic ways, while laboratory studies are\ndesigned to control for alternative explanations and nuisance\nvariables (see\n section 2).\n Some researchers also argue that \u201cunnatural\u201d environments\nmight direct development and learning in ways that supports the\nemergence of new or enhanced cognitive capacities. Captive great apes,\nfor example, develop problem-solving and communicative abilities not\nfound in their wild conspecifics, such as tool use, pointing, and sign\nlanguage (Tomasello & Call 2008; Bandini & Harrison 2020).\nStudying animals outside of their natural environment might provide\ninsight into their cognitive potential when appropriately scaffolded\nby the environment.\n\nOverall, most researchers acknowledge that a plurality of methods is\nneeded for understanding animal minds. For example, Michael Tomasello\nand Josep Call write regarding primate cognition research that,\n\n\nfieldwork is primary. It tells us what animals do; it sets the\nproblem. But then if we wish to figure out what is the nature of the\ncognitive skill, if any, underlying some activity in the wild, we need\nexperiments. (2008: 451)\n\n\nKristin Andrews documents different possible sources of bias in the\nfield and laboratory. For example, in the field, ethograms might lead\nto confirmation bias, while in the laboratory, the importance of the\nrelationships between human experimenters and study participants is\noften underemphasized (see Andrews 2020: 42\u201361). Andrews\nconcludes that comparative psychologists should aim to employ and\nintegrate a variety of methods for studying animal minds, rather than\nseek to eliminate bias. Colin Allen and Marc Bekoff (1997) similarly\nemphasize the need for an interdisciplinary approach:\n\n\nScience is not likely to make complete contact with the nature of\nanimal minds at any single point\u2014many methods will be useful,\nand competing hypotheses should be evaluated. (1997: 180)\n\n",
