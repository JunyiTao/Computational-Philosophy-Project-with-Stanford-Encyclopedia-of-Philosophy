    "preamble": "\n\nA dialetheia is a sentence, \\(A\\), such that both it and its\nnegation, \\(\\neg A\\), are true. If falsity is assumed to be the truth\nof negation, a dialetheia is a sentence which is both true and false.\nSuch a sentence is, or has, what is called a truth value\nglut, in distinction to a gap, a sentence that is\nneither true nor false. (We shall talk of sentences throughout this\nentry; but one could run the definition in terms of propositions,\nstatements, or whatever one takes as one\u2019s favourite\ntruth-bearer: this would make little difference in the context.)\n\nDialetheism is the view that there are dialetheias. If we\ndefine a\n contradiction\n as a couple of sentences, one of which is the negation of the other,\nor as a conjunction of such sentences, then dialetheism amounts to the\nclaim that there are true contradictions. As such,\ndialetheism opposes\u2014contradicts\u2014the Law of\nNon-Contradiction (LNC), sometimes also called the Law of\nContradiction. The Law can be expressed in various ways; fixing the\nprecise formulation is itself a topic of debate (Priest et al 2004,\nPart II). Thomas Reid put the LNC in the form \u2018No proposition is\nboth true and false\u2019. A strong (modal) statement of the LNC is:\nfor any \\(A\\), it is impossible that both \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\) be\ntrue. \n\nIn Book \\(\\Gamma\\) of the Metaphysics, Aristotle introduced\n(what was later to be called) the LNC as \u201cthe most certain of\nall principles\u201d (1005b24)\u2014firmissimum omnium\nprincipiorum, as the Medieval theologians said. Since Aristotle,\nthere have been few sustained attempts to defend the law. The\nLNC has been an (often unstated) assumption, felt to be so fundamental\nto rationality that some claim it cannot be defended, e.g.\nDavid Lewis 1999. As a challenge to the LNC, therefore, dialetheism\nassails what most philosophers take to be unassailable common sense,\ncalling into question the rules for what can be called into question\n(cf. Woods 2003, 2005; Dutilh Novaes 2008). \n\nSince the advent of\n paraconsistent logic\n in the second half of the twentieth century, dialetheism has been\ndeveloped as a view in philosophical logic, with precise formal\nlanguage. Dialetheism has been most famously advanced as a response to\n logical paradoxes,\n in tandem with a paraconsistent logic. The view has been gaining, if\nnot acceptance, the respect of other parties in the debate; one critic\nwrites that dialetheists have shown,\n\nas clearly as anything like this can be shown, that it is coherent to\nmaintain that some sentences can be true and false at the same time.\n\u2026 [A]nd that perhaps is a radical conclusion, and a major\nadvance in our understanding of the issues (Parsons 1990).\n\n\nIn this article, 1) we will start by explaining the connection between\ndialetheism and other important related concepts, such as the ones of\ntrivialism and paraconsistency. Next, we will describe 2) the history\nof dialetheism and 3) the motivations for contemporary dialetheism,\namong which the logical (semantic and set-theoretic) paradoxes figure\nprominently, though not exclusively. We will then 4) indicate and\ndiscuss some of the objections to dialetheism, and 5) its connections\nwith the notion of rationality. Finally, 6) we will point at some\npossible themes for further inquiry concerning the connections between\ndialetheism, realism and antirealism in metaphysics.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Some Basic Concepts\n\nThe word \u2018dialetheism\u2019 was coined by Graham Priest and\nRichard Routley (later Sylvan) in 1981 (Priest et al 1989, p.\nxx). The inspiration for the name was a passage in\nWittgenstein\u2019s Remarks on the Foundations of\nMathematics, concerning\n Russell\u2019s paradox\n (see also below):\n\nWhy should Russell\u2019s contradiction not be conceived of as\nsomething supra-propositional, something that towers above the\npropositions and looks in both directions like a Janus head? The\nproposition that contradicts itself would stand like a monument (with\na Janus head) over the propositions of logic (1978, III.59).\n\n\nA dialetheia is a two-way truth, facing both truth and falsity like a\nJanus-headed figure. Unfortunately, Priest and Routley forgot to agree\nhow to spell the \u2018ism\u2019, and versions with and without the\n\u2018e\u2019 appear in print. \n\nIn philosophy, there tends not to be a distinction between a view\nbeing inconsistent and being incoherent. Both are\nunacceptable. Since dialetheism claims that some inconsistency can be\nmaintained without incoherence, these two concepts must be\ndisentangled. For a start, dialetheism should be distinguished from\nso-called trivialism, that claim that all sentences\nare true, and hence all contradictions are true too (Kabay 2010).\nDialetheism is the view that some contradictions are true. A\ntrivialist must be a dialetheist, since a trivialist accepts every\nclaim. But since \u2018some\u2019 does not imply \u2018all\u2019,\nthe converse is not the case: a dialetheist typically claims that only\nsome (and, usually, very specific) sentences are dialetheias, not that\nall of them are. Trivialism is by all accounts incoherent, and so is\nminimally what counts as unacceptable even for someone who thinks that\nsome contradictions are true.\n\nHow to allow inconsistency without incoherence is one of the main\ntopics of dialetheim. A standard solution consists in subscribing to\nthe view that deductive logical consequence is\n paraconsistent.\n A logical consequence relation \\(\\vdash\\) is explosive if,\naccording to it, a contradiction entails everything (ex\ncontradictione quodlibet: for all \\(A\\) and \\(B\\): \\(A,\\neg A\n\\vdash B\\)). It is paraconsistent if and only if (iff) it is not\nexplosive. By adopting a paraconsistent logic, a dialetheist can\ncountenance some contradictions without being thereby committed to\ncountenancing everything and, in particular, all contradictions. The\ndevelopment of paraconsistent logics has contributed to the most\nrecent developments (and acceptance of the legitimacy) of\ndialetheism.\n\nDialetheism should, however, be clearly distinguished from\nparaconsistency. Whereas dialetheists must embrace some paraconsistent\nlogic or other to avoid trivialism, paraconsistent logicians need not\nbe dialetheists: they may subscribe to a non-explosive view of\nentailment for other reasons. Within paraconsistency, one may\ndistinguish (at least) four grades of paraconsistent involvement\n(Beall and Restall 2006, p.80): \n\n Gentle-strength paraconsistency is simply the rejection\nof explosion with respect to logical consequence.\nFull-strength paraconsistency has it that there are\ninteresting or important theories that are inconsistent but not\ntrivial.\nIndustrial-strength paraconsistency has it that some\ninconsistent but non-trivial theories are possibly true.\nDialetheic paraconsistency has it that some inconsistent\nbut non-trivial theories are true.\n\n\nMost people working on paraconsistent logics have commitments at the\nlower grades of the spectrum. The unifying thought behind\nparaconsistency is gentle-strength: logical consequence should not\nvalidate arbitrary conclusions following indiscriminately from\ninconsistent premises. This may simply be because entailment must\npreserve more than just truth, e.g., information content, topicality,\nor some meaningful connection between premises and conclusion.\nCarnielli and Rodrigues (2019) advance an explicitly anti-dialetheic\ninterpretation of paraconsistent logic, where there may be epistemic\ncontradictions\u2014inconsistencies in evidence or belief\u2014but\nno true contradictions. Or it may be that a paraconsistent logician\nsimply need not assume anything about truth in order to provide a\nworking treatment of inconsistency as it may arise in databases, legal\nsituations, works of fiction, theory change, belief-revision, etc.\n\n\nStepping up, full-strength paraconsistentists treat inconsistent\nmodels, in which contradictions hold, as useful mathematical tools\nwithout committing to them as representing real\npossibilities. \n\nAnd stepping up again, industrial-strength paraconsistentists may hold\nthat, though truth at the actual world is consistent, still entailment\nmust preserve what holds in peculiar non-actual situations, some of\nwhich may be inconsistent (see Berto, 2007a, Ch. 5, and Priest, Beall\nand Armour-Garb, 2004, p. 6). The first three levels appear to be\nindependent of dialetheism. (But for reason to worry that there is a\n\u2018slippery slope\u2019 from gentle to dialetheic\nparaconsistency, see Priest 2000. For particular worries about model\ntheory, see Asmus 2012, and in the modal case, Martin 2015.) \n\nAt the top of the spectrum, dialethiec paraconsistency holds that some\ncontradictions are, in some sense, true in the actual world.\nEven among full-fledged dialetheists, differences remain, for example,\nin what is meant by \u201ctrue\u201d, e.g., on whether they\nsubscribe to a\n deflationary theory of truth,\n a\n correspondence view,\n a view in which true contradictions are merely semantic, or something\nelse. We will come back to this point in\n section 6\n below.\n\nWe said at the outset that dialetheism challenges the LNC.\nNow this claim needs some qualification, since forms of the LNC are,\nin fact, accepted as a general logical law in dialetheism, at least in\nversions based in e.g. the paraconsistent logic LP. Dialetheism as set\nout by Priest takes all instances of the schema \\(\\neg(A \\wedge \\neg\nA)\\) to be true, as well as taking as true some sentences that are\ninconsistent with it, namely, true sentences whose negations are true:\ndialetheias. According to such versions of dialetheism, all\ncontradictions are false and some are true: dialetheism is itself a\ndialetheia (\u2018Concluding self-referential postscript\u2019 to\nPriest 1979, p. 203). \n\nMuch of the ongoing discussion about dialetheism involves not just the\nLNC but its dual, the Law of Excluded Middle (LEM). (See\n section 3.2\n below.) The LEM says (informally) that for every sentence \\(A\\),\neither \\(A\\) or \\(\\neg A\\) is true (we bracket here views that\ndisentangle the LEM from Bivalence). Dialetheism is the thesis that\nthere are truth value gluts, challenging the LNC; the dual position,\nchallenging the LEM, is that there are truth value gaps. It is a\nsubtle issue, which we will not discuss here, whether a gap should\ncount as lacking any\n truth value,\n or as having a non-classical value distinct from both truth and\nfalsity, and similarly whether a glut has two truth values, or some\nthird \u2018glutty\u2019 value. In any case, these dual approaches\nare nowadays labelled paracomplete versus (paraconsistent)\ndialetheic theories of truth. (The paraconsistent/paracomplete\nterminology is not entirely happy: see Ripley 2015a, footnote 1; but\nis now standard.) Priest\u2019s logic includes the LEM and he rejects\nthe existence of gaps in Priest 1987/2006, ch.1. Other approaches are\nboth paracomplete and paraconsistent; they include a place for both\ngaps and gluts. The case for and against dialetheism turns as much on\nthe status of the LEM as the LNC; see Beall and Ripley 2018.\n2. Dialetheism in the History of Philosophy\n\nWhile the word \u2018dialetheism\u2019 is relatively new, the idea\nis not. In this section we note some points in the history of\nphilosophy where true contradictions appear salient, either explicitly\nor implicitly. (Much of this scholarship is due originally to Priest\nand Routley 1983, and Priest 1995/2002.) Then we address\nmethodological issues to do with historical interpretation, and give a\nquick sketch of more recent history. For another history of\ndialetheism, see Ficara 2021. (Note that Ficara, following\nd\u2019Agostini\u2019s interpretation of Hegel, takes dialetheism to be the view\nthat there are non-explosive true contradictions, and distinguishes\nthis from glut theory, the view that there can be true and false\npropositions. This diverges from the way we\u2019ve set things out here,\nand merits further discussion in itself.)\n2.1 Dialetheism in Western Philosophy\n\nAristotle takes a number of the Presocratics to endorse dialetheism,\nand with apparent justification. For example, in Fragment 49a,\nHeraclitus says: \u201cWe step and do not step into the same rivers;\nwe are and we are not\u201d (Robinson, 1987, p. 35). Protagorean\nrelativism may be expressed by the view that man is the measure of all\nthings; but according to Aristotle, since \u201cMany men hold beliefs\nin which they conflict with one another\u201d, it follows that\n\u201cthe same thing must be and not be\u201d (1009a10\u201312).\nThe Presocratic views triggered Aristotle\u2019s attack in\nMetaphysics, Book \\(\\Gamma\\). Chapter 4 of this Book contains\nAristotle\u2019s defence of the LNC. As we said above, historically\nAristotle was almost completely successful: the LNC has been orthodoxy\nin Western Philosophy ever since.\n\nAs an aside, and as mentioned above, there is an often-remarked upon\nduality between truth-value gaps and truth-value gluts (Parsons 1990).\nAnd yet, it is perhaps worth noting that in Metaphysics\n\\(\\Gamma\\) (Chapter 7) Aristotle also defends the dual of the LNC, the\nLaw of Excluded Middle, LEM, particularly in the version which has\nnowadays been distinguished as the Law of Bivalence: for any \\(A\\), it\nis necessary for (at least) one of \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\) to be true.\nBut the LEM has often had a less secure place in Western Philosophy\nthan the LNC, in spite of the numerous obvious dualities between the\ntwo principles. Aristotle himself, at least according to one\ninterpretation, appears to attack the Law in De\nInterpretatione, Chapter 9, when he comes to the famous subject\nof\n future contingents.\n\nDespite the orthodoxy about the LNC since Aristotle, during the Middle\nAges the problem of seemingly true contradictions surfaced in\nconnection to the paradoxes of divine omnipotence\u2014for instance:\ncan God make a stone too heavy for Him to lift? (See Cotnoir 2018.) We\nfind St. Pier Damiani getting close to dialetheism in the De\ndivina omnipotentia, by blaming St. Girolamus for having claimed\nthat God cannot overturn the past and twist what happened into\nsomething that didn\u2019t happen. Since God lives an eternal\npresent, denying Him power over the past equates to denying Him power\nover current and future events, which is blasphemous. So God must have\nthe power of making what is done undone. Later on, Nicholas of Cusa\nplaced at the core of his book De docta ignorantia the idea\nthat God is coincidentia oppositorum: as a truly infinite\nbeing, He includes all opposite and incompatible properties, therefore\nbeing all things, and none of them: God has all properties, including\ncontradictory ones (Heron, 1954, I.4).\n\nIn the Critique of Pure Reason, Kant argues that some\ncontradictions, the antinomies of pure reason (concerning time, space,\nand other categories), are produced by an illicit use of pure\nconcepts; nevertheless, he also holds such an illicit use to be a\n\u201cnatural and inevitable illusion\u201d (Kant, 1781, p.\n300)\u2014a side effect of reason\u2019s pursuit of completeness in\nknowledge. Reasoning about the world as a whole, a totality which is\nnever given to us as such, can lead us to apparently dialetheic\nconclusions: e.g. that it has a beginning in time and a limit in\nspace, and that it has no beginning nor limits in space, that it is\ninfinite in space and time. Both horns assume the opposite thesis and\nseemingly perform a reductio. (In Kantian terms, the\n\u201ctranscendental illusion\u201d begins when we turn what should\njust be a regulative ideal into a limit-object.) According to Kant, at\nleast in one way of resolving the antinomies, the fallacy lies in\ntreating the world as a whole as an object\u2014in mistaking a\nsubjective \u201ccondition\u201d, as Kant says, for an objective\nreality.\n\nNow, according to Hegel such a conception has something to be said for\nit as well as against it. Kant has a point in showing, via the\nantinomies, that dialectics is \u201ca necessary function of\nreason\u201d, and in defending \u201cthe necessity of the\ncontradiction which belongs to the nature of thought\ndeterminations\u201d (Hegel, 1831, p. 56). However, Kant takes from\nthis only the familiar result that reason is incapable of knowing the\nAbsolute, that is, actual reality. A dialetheic interpretation holds\nthat, on the contrary, we should abandon such \u201ctenderness for\nthe things of this world\u201d, and the idea that \u201cthe stain of\ncontradiction ought not to be in the essence of what is in the world;\nit has to belong only to thinking reason\u201d (Hegel, 1830,\np. 92). On a dialetheic interpretation, contrary to what Kant held,\nthe Kantian antinomies are not a reductio of the illusions of\nreason; they are perfectly sound arguments, deducing the dialetheic\nnature of the world. (For a reconstruction of this Kantian-Hegelian\ndebate, see Part II of Priest 2002.) Hegel himself has been\ninterpreted as being a dialetheist. Notably, d\u2019Agostini argues that\nwhile Hegel held that some conjunctions of contradictory sentences are\ntrue, he did so without the further commitment that either of the two\ncontradictory terms are separately true; see d\u2019Agostini 2021.\n2.2 Dialetheism in East Asian Philosophy\n\nIn non-Western traditions, there are more overt examples of what\nappears to be dialetheic thought. In ancient Indian logic/metaphysics,\nthere were standardly four possibilities to be considered on any\nstatement at issue: that it is true (only), false (only), neither true\nnor false, or both true and false. Some logicians added a fifth\npossibility: none of these. Both positions were, arguably, called\ncatushkoti (Priest 2002, ch.16; Deguchi et al 2008; Tillemans\n2009.) The Jains went even further and advocated the possibility of\ncontradictory values of the kind: true (only) and both true and false\n(see Smart 1964). \n\nContradictory utterances are a commonplace in Daoism, perhaps most\nfamously in Laozi (Lao-Tsu): on one translation,\n\nThe Way that can be spoken of is not the true Way\u2026 (Daodejing\nI)\n\n\na statement which appears to be speaking about the true Way. The\nZhuangzi says: \u201cThat which makes things has no boundaries with\nthings, but for things to have boundaries is what we mean by saying\n\u2018the boundaries between things\u2019. The boundaryless boundary\nis the boundary without a boundary\u201d (Mair, 1994, p. 218). When\nBuddhism and Daoism fused to form Chan (or Zen, to give it its\nJapanese name), a philosophy arose in which contradiction plays a\ncentral role. The very process for reaching enlightenment (Prajna) is\na process, according to Suzuki (1969, p. 55), \u201cwhich is at once\nabove and in the process of reasoning. This is a contradiction,\nformally considered, but in truth, this contradiction is itself made\npossible because of Prajna.\u201d\n\nRecent discussions of dialetheism have centered on Buddhist thought in\nparticular, where some interpreters argue that texts invoke outright\ncontradictions. For example, in the Mahayana tradition, Nagarjuna\npresents many passages similar in form to:\n\nEverything is real and not real, both real and not real, neither real\nnor not real. This is the Lord Buddha\u2019s teaching (Garfield 1995,\nXVIII:8).\n\n\nOn a dialetheic interpretation, advocated by Priest, Garfield, and\nDeguchi (see Priest 2002 ch.16, Deguchi et al 2008), readers should\ntake Nagarjuna and others in the Madhyamaka school at their\nword\u2014not as invoking some sort of mysticism, but as affirming\nthe nature of reality. This is most salient in Nagarjuna\u2019s\ndoctrine of emptiness (sunyata), that all things are empty or lacking\nindependent existence (svabhava). Since all things are empty, it\nfollows that emptiness is empty too; or, more prosaically, \u201cThe\nultimate truth is that there is no ultimate truth\u201d (Siderits\n2007, p.182; Priest 2002, p.260). These utterances, if true, would\nappear to be self-contradictory, and therefore dialetheias. See Priest\n2018.\n\nFor work on dialetheism in Buddhism, see the collections Garfield et\nal 2009 and Tanaka et al 2015. For discussion as to whether\ndialetheism is the appropriate way to interpret Buddhist texts, see\nthe papers in Tanaka 2013. For more general difficulties see the entry\non\n comparative philosophy: Chinese and Western.\n2.3 On interpretation of history\n\nInterpreting the philosophers we have mentioned is a sensitive issue.\nMany commentators have suggested that the seemingly contradictory\nutterances of the philosophers in question are not really\ncontradictory. There are a number of standard devices that may be\nemployed to block a dialetheic interpretation. One is to question, in\nthe case of non-English sources, whether the apparently contradictory\ntranslation is correct. Another is to claim that the contradictory\nutterance is to be taken as having some non-literal form of meaning,\ne.g., that it is a metaphor, or a way of pointing towards some higher,\nineffable truth. Another is to claim that the contradictory assertion\nis ambiguous in some way, and that it is true on one disambiguation or\nrespect, false in another.\n\nThis last technique is called parameterisation: when one is\nconfronted with a seemingly true contradiction, \\(A \\wedge \\neg A\\),\ntreat the suspected dialetheia \\(A\\), or some of its parts, as having\ndifferent meanings, and hence as ambiguous (maybe just\ncontextually ambiguous). For instance, if one claims that\n\\(P(a) \\wedge \\neg P(a)\\), parameterisation holds that one is in\neffect claiming that \\(P_1 (a) \\wedge \\neg P_2 (a)\\) (e.g. elephants\nare big and not big, because they are big in the context of land\nanimals on Earth, but not big in the context of stars and planets). In\nthe Metaphysics, Aristotle hints that a critic of the LNC is\nplaying with the equivocal meanings of some words: \u201cfor to each\ndefinition there might be assigned a different word\u201d (1006b\n1\u20132).\n\nNo one would dispute that contradictory utterances are sometimes best\nconstrued parametrically. (Again, dialetheists do not claim that\nall contradictory statements are true.) The question is\nwhether parameterisation is the best approach in the case of the\nphilosophers we have mentioned; answering this in a dialetheic context\nis a matter for detailed case-by-case consideration. A defender of the\ndialetheic interpretation would say that consistent parameterisation\nproduces an inaccurate and distorted version of the views of the\nphilosopher in question. In any case, even if parameterisation is\nalways possible, this does not impact arguments for or against the\nLNC. An a priori claim that contradictions can\nalways be avoided by parameterisation does not show, without begging\nthe question, the correctness of such interpretations:\nsometimes parameterisation may be the best thing to do, but\nindependent justification should be given on each occasion.\n2.4 Modern Dialetheism\n\nIn the second half of the twentieth century, with the rapid\ndevelopment of paraconsistent logics, came the modern form of\ndialetheism. In 1966, Asenjo published a short note, \u201cA Calculus\nof Antinomies\u201d, based on his 1954 PhD dissertation; the opening\nline reads\n\nLet us assume that atomic propositions have either one or two truth\nvalues (Asenjo 1966, p.103).\n\n\nHere, having two truth values would mean being both true and\nfalse, a glut, or what Asenjo calls (following Kant) an antinomy.\nAsenjo simply seems to assume without further ado that there are\nantinomies, and in Asenjo and Tamburino 1975 asserts that they are\n\u201cuseful logical entities\u201d, especially for dealing with\nparadoxes in mathematical contexts. Born in Buenos Aires, Asenjo came\nto the University of Pittsburg in 1963 as a professor in the\nmathematics faculty, where he was in contact with logicians such as\nBelnap, Anderson, their student Dunn (who thanks Asenjo in his 1966\nPhD thesis, that also toys with true contradictions), and nearby,\nMeyer. By the mid-1970s, Richard Routley (Sylvan), in collaboration\nwith Meyer, was developing a \u2018dialectical\u2019 position that\nrebukes what they call \u201cthe consistency hypothesis\u201d and\naccepts some statements as both true and false (Routley and Meyer\n1976; Routley 1977, 1979). In 1979, Priest\u2019s paper \u201cThe\nLogic of Paradox\u201d, developed eventually into the book In\nContradiction (1987/2006), presented what are now the most famous\narguments for dialetheism. In the collaboration between Priest and\nRoutley, the contemporary dialetheic program was launched. Much of\nPriest and Routley\u2019s early joint work is summarised in Priest et\nal 1989 (also available as Priest and Routley 1983). More recent\ndevelopments are canvassed below. \n3. Motivations for Dialetheism\n3.1 The Paradoxes of Self-Reference\n\nProbably the master argument used by modern dialetheists invokes the\nlogical\n paradoxes of self-reference.\n It is customary to distinguish between two families of such\nparadoxes: semantic and set-theoretic. The former family typically\ninvolves such concepts as truth, denotation,\ndefinability, etc; the latter, such notions as\nmembership, cardinality, etc. After\nG\u00f6del\u2019s and Tarski\u2019s well known formal procedures to\nobtain non-contextual self-reference in formalized languages, it is\ndifficult to draw a sharp line between the two families, among other\nthings, because of the fact that Tarskian semantics is itself framed\nin set-theoretic terms. Nevertheless, the distinction is commonly\naccepted within the relevant literature.\n\nRussell\u2019s paradox\n is the most famous of the set-theoretic paradoxes; it arises when one\nconsiders the set of all non self-membered sets, the Russell\nset.\n Cantor\u2019s paradox\n arises in connection with the universal set. The most famous of the\nsemantic paradoxes is the\n Liar paradox.\n Although cases for the existence of dialetheias can be made from\nalmost any paradox of self-reference, we will focus only on the Liar,\ngiven that it is the most easily understandable and its exposition\nrequires no particular technicalities.\n3.2 A Simple Case Study: the Liar\n\nIn its standard version, the Liar paradox arises by reasoning on the\nfollowing sentence:\n\n(1): (1) is false \n\nwhere the number to the left is the name of the sentence to the right.\nAs we can see, (1) refers to itself and tells us something about (1)\nitself. Its truth value? Let us reason by cases. Suppose (1) is true:\nthen what it says is the case, so it is false. Then, suppose (1) is\nfalse: this is what it claims to be, so it is true. If we accept the\naforementioned Law of Bivalence, that is, the principle according to\nwhich all sentences are either true or false, both alternatives lead\nto a contradiction: (1) is both true and false, that is, a dialetheia,\ncontrary to the LNC.\n\nThe paradox can also be produced without any direct self-reference,\nbut via a short-circuit of sentences. For instance, here is a looped\nLiar:\n\n(2a): (2b) is true\n\n(2b): (2a) is false\n\nIf what (2a) says is true, then (2b) is true. However, (2b) says that\n(2a) is false \u2026. And so on: we are in a paradoxical loop. This\nis as old as Buridan (his Sophism no. 9: Plato saying \u2018What\nSocrates says is true\u2019; Socrates replying \u2018What Plato\nsays is false\u2019). \n\nParadoxes of this kind have been known since antiquity (the standard\nLiar is attributed to the Greek philosopher Eubulides, probably the\ngreatest paradox-producer of antiquity). But they were thrown into\nprominence by developments in the foundations of mathematics around\nthe turn of the twentieth century. In the case of each paradox, there\nappears to be a perfectly sound argument ending in a contradiction. If\nthe arguments are sound, then dialetheism is true. Of course, many\nhave argued that the soundness of such arguments is merely an\nappearance, and that subtle fallacies may be diagnosed in them. Such\nsuggestions were made in ancient and medieval logic; but many more\nhave been made in modern logic\u2014indeed, attacking the paradoxes\nhas been something of a leitmotiv of modern logic. And one\nthing that appears to have come out of this is how resilient the\nparadoxes are: attempts to solve them often simply succeed in\nrelocating the paradoxes elsewhere, as so called\n\u2018strengthened\u2019 forms of the arguments show. Let us have a\nlook.\n\nA radical solution, which never won big consensus but has been\nrevitalised in recent times (Pleitz 2018), has it that there just\ncannot be meaningful self-rererential sentences. Various works\n(notably Martin 1967, van Fraassen 1968, Kripke 1975, Field 2008) have\nproposed to solve the Liar paradox by dismissing Bivalence, whereby\nsome sentences are neither true nor false, and the Liar is one such\ntruth value \u2018gap\u2019. Truth value gaps, and the inclusion of\nthe Liar among them, are differently motivated in the various\napproaches. But the common core thought is the following: even though\nthe Liar is a sentence such that, if it were true, it would be false,\nand vice versa, no explicit contradiction according to which\nit is both true and false need follow. We can avoid the contradiction\nby rejecting the idea that truth and falsity are the only two options\nfor a sentence: the Liar is neither. For a comparative survey of the\ntwo kinds of approach, see Beall and Ripley 2018.\n\nThese approaches face difficulties with the so-called\n\u2018strengthened\u2019 Liars\u2014sentences such as the\nfollowing:\n\n(3): (3) is not true.\n\n(4): (4) is false or neither true nor false.\n\nNow these sentences should be, on the gappy theorist\u2019s\nnon-bivalent approach, either true, or false, or neither. But, for\ninstance, if (3) is true, then things are as it claims they are;\ntherefore, (3) is not true (either false or truth-valueless). If (3)\nis false, or neither true nor false, in both cases it is not true; but\nthis is precisely what it claims to be; therefore, it is true. We seem\nto have to conclude that (3) is both true and not true, contrary to\nthe LNC. A similar line of reasoning goes for (4).\n\nAccording to Priest the strengthened Liars show that a single feature\nof the semantic paradox underlies its different formulations. The\ntotality of sentences is divided into two subsets: the true ones, and\ntheir \u2018bona fide complement\u2019\u2014call it the\nRest. Now the essence of the liar is \u201ca particular\ntwisted construction which forces a sentence, if it is in the bona\nfide truths, to be in the Rest (too); conversely, if it is in the\nRest, it is in the bona fide truths\u201d (Priest 1987, p. 23). The\nstandard Liar, \u2018This sentence is false\u2019, is just a\nparticular instance of this, producing a contradiction within the\nbivalent framework, in which the Rest is identified with the set of\nthe false sentences. We can try to resolve the problem by admitting\nsentences that are neither true nor false, so that the false ones\nbecome a proper subset of the Rest. However, the strengthened Liars\nshow that we can use the notions introduced to solve the previous\nparadox to re-describe the Rest. Once the set of sentences is\npartitioned into a trichotomy (true, false, and neither true nor\nfalse), the disjunctive \u2018This sentence is false or neither true\nnor false\u2019 embraces the whole Rest, i.e. the new(ly described)\ncomplement of the set of the true sentences. What about adding more\nvalues? If there is some fourth thing that a sentence can be, besides\ntrue, false, and neither true nor false, we can always take the notion\nfourth thing and produce another strengthened Liar:\n\n(5): (5) is false, or neither true nor false, or the fourth thing.\n\n\nSee Kirkham 1992, pp. 293\u20134. These strengthened liars are also\ncalled revenge liars, and the general phenomenon we have just\nwitnessed has become known as revenge; see Beall 2007, e.g.\nthe introduction, and Cook 2007, among other essays. \n\nThere is no generally agreed upon solution to the semantic paradoxes.\nOne typical way out attempted by the supporters of truth value gaps,\nfor instance, consists in denying that the notion of gap, or\ndefective sentence, or sentence whose truth value is\nindeterminate, can be fully expressed in the language for which\nthey are proposing their theory of truth. The strengthened paradoxes\nthen seem to force the consistent theorist to admit that the proposed\ntheory was formulated in a language different from, and expressively\nmore powerful than, the one whose semantics it was supposed to\nexpress. This entails a limitation of the Tarskian T-schema\ncharacterising truth, i.e., of the equivalence \n\\[\nTr\\langle A\\rangle \\leftrightarrow A\n\\]\n\n\nwhere \u2018\\(Tr\\)\u2019 is the truth predicate for the relevant\nlanguage, and \\(\\langle A\\rangle\\) is the appropriate name of sentence\n\\(A\\). This approach makes a rigid distinction between an object\nlanguage and its metalanguage. Such a distinction was introduced by\nTarski to expel the Liar paradox from formalized languages\u2014but\nTarski himself insisted that his solution is inapplicable to natural\nlanguages, which do not appear to depend upon some metalanguage for\ntheir semantics. As Kripke admits at the end of Outline of a\nTheory of Truth, \u201cthe ghost of the Tarski hierarchy is\nstill with us\u201d (scil. the paracompletists: see Kripke 1975, p.\n80).\n\nTarski, in short, identified the cause of the semantic paradoxes to be\nsemantic closure\u2014the fact that natural languages such\nas English satisfy the T-schema. Tarski took this to mean that there\ncan be no consistent formalization of a semantically complete\nlanguage, only a approximation thereof stratified into metalanguages.\nDialetheists agree, but draw the conclusion in the other direction:\nthe appropriate formalization of a language such as ours, because it\nis semantically closed and is not hierarchically stratified, will be\ninconsistent (Priest 1987, ch.1, Beall 2009, ch.1).\n\nThese two features\u2014a claimed immunity to revenge/strengthened\nliars, and dispensing with the object-language/metalanguage\ndistinction\u2014are argued to give dialetheism about the paradoxes\nof self-reference some of its major appeal. As Shapiro (in a critical\nnote) puts it, dialetheists offer that we\n\ndo not need to keep running through richer and richer meta-languages\nin order to chase our semantic tails.\u2026 We embrace some\ncontradictions in the semantics, and get it all from the start\n(Shapiro 2002, p. 818).\n\n\nThe simplicity of a dialetheic theory of truth, then, is\nclaimed as an additional further feature. The two most prominent such\ntheories to date are presented in Priest 1987, and Beall 2009. In the\nformer, the truth predicate \\(Tr\\) for the relevant formal language,\nmodelling the behaviour of truth in English, is simply characterized\nby the unrestricted T-schema, \\(Tr\\langle A\\rangle \\leftrightarrow\nA\\), which, as stressed by many philosophers, is an overwhelmingly\nintuitive\u2014perhaps even analytic\u2014principle concerning\ntruth. It is admitted that some sentences\u2014notably, the\nLiars\u2014are truth value gluts, that is, both true and false (the\nconstruction may also sustain sentences which are both true and not\ntrue, although not all dialetheias need be of this kind); and no\nhierarchy of metalanguages or further epicycles are needed.\n\nBeall\u2019s 2009 theory allows a fully transparent truth\npredicate: one such that for any sentence \\(A\\), \\(Tr\\langle\nA\\rangle\\) and \\(A\\) can be replaced with each other in all\n(non-opaque) contexts salva veritate, that is, producing\nsentences logically equivalent to the sentences one started with. Then\nthe unrestricted T-schema follows from transparency (and the fact that\n\\(A \\rightarrow A\\) is a logical truth) as a special case. In\nBeall\u2019s theory, all sentences \\(A\\) that are\ndialetheias are not only true and false, i.e. (given that falsity is\ntruth of negation), \\(Tr\\langle A\\rangle \\wedge Tr\\langle \\neg\nA\\rangle\\); they are also true and untrue, \\(Tr\\langle A\\rangle \\wedge\n\\neg Tr\\langle A\\rangle\\): this again follows from the transparency of\ntruth. Beall\u2019s theory is based on a (relevant) paraconsistent\nlogic, whose modal semantics employs so-called\n non-normal worlds.\n \n\nOverall, such paradoxes as the Liar provide some evidence for the\ndialetheist\u2019s claim that some contradictions are\nprovably true, in the sense that they are entailed by plain\nfacts concerning natural language and our thought processes. Extended\nLiar paradoxes like \u2018This sentence is not true\u2019 are spelt\nin ordinary English. Their paradoxical characteristics, dialetheists\nargue, are due exactly to the intuitive features of ordinary language:\nunavoidable self-reference; the failure of metalinguistic hierarchies,\nwhich only produce languages that are expressively weaker than\nEnglish; and the obvious presence of a truth predicate for English,\n\u2018is true\u2019, which is characterized, at least extensionally,\nby either the Tarskian T-schema or rules amounting to the transparency\nof truth. For a sustained critical engagement with paraconsistent\ndialetheism as a solution to the semantic paradoxes, see Field 2008,\npart 5 (chapters 23\u201326).\n3.3 Other Paradoxes of Self-Reference\n\nIn the larger family of paradoxes of self-reference beyond the\nsemantic, dialetheism affords a treatment of the set-theoretic\nparadoxes. These paradoxes arise in set theories based on an\nunrestricted \u2018comprehension schema\u2019 for sets: for any\ncondition or property, including paradoxical ones like\nnon-self-membership, there exists a corresponding set. In particular,\ninconsistent sets like Russell\u2019s are admitted; analogously to\nthe Liar, the Russell set is and is not a member of itself. As with\nthe truth schema, the set comprehension principle seems very natural\nand intuitive, and such contradictions do not give rise to triviality\ndue to the paraconsistent logic underlying the formal theories. Though\nthe issue is too technical to be addressed here, and more\nappropriately dealt with in the entries on\n paraconsistent logic\n and\n inconsistent mathematics,\n the reader can consult Routley 1979, Brady 1989, for inconsistent set\ntheories, and Weber 2012. See also Mortensen 1995. For different\napproaches to dialetheic set theory, see Restall 1992 and Ripley\n2015b.\n\nSince dialetheism appears to resolve both the semantic and set\ntheoretic paradoxes at once and in the same sort of way (namely,\naccept the contradictory outcomes as true), this has been presented as\nanother major strong point for dialetheism. Priest argues that the\nparadoxes share an underlying structure (which he calls the Inclosure\nSchema in Priest 2002). This is used in tandem with what Priest dubs\nthe principle of uniform solution (\u201csame kind of\nparadox, same kind of solution\u201d) to urge that, since all the set\ntheoretic and semantic paradoxes are of a kind, then dialetheism\npresents a uniquely unified solution. For a detailed pursuit of a\ndialetheic response to the paradoxes in general, see Weber 2021. \n\nA point of dispute about the dialetheic approach to the paradoxes of\nself-reference concerns the\n Curry paradox.\n This is produced by a self-referential sentence claiming \u2018If I\nam true, then \\(\\bot\\)\u2019, where \\(\\bot\\) is a constant (what\nlogicians usually call the falsum) which is or entails\nsomething that is also dialetheically unacceptable, say \\(\\bot =\\)\n\u2018Everything is true\u2019, the incoherent trivialist claim.\nPrima facie, this does not involve negation, nor a falsity\npredicate. However, many logicians think that Curry\u2019s paradox is\nvery similar to the Liar, and therefore by the principle of uniform\nsolution that it should be handled in the same way. A dialetheist,\nthough, cannot simply accept that the Curry sentence is both true and\nfalse, because if it is true then \\(\\bot\\) follows. Dialetheists need\na different treatment of Curry. A standard dialetheic strategy to deal\nwith the Curry paradox has consisted in exploiting paraconsistent\nlogics with a \u2018noncontractive\u2019 conditional (see again\nPriest 1987, Ch, 6, Beall 2009, Ch. 2), which do not validate the\nContraction (or Absorption) Law, i.e., the rule: from \\(A\n\\rightarrow(A \\rightarrow B)\\) infer \\(A \\rightarrow B\\), or the\nso-called pseudo-modus ponens principle \\((A \\wedge(A\n\\rightarrow B)) \\rightarrow B\\). Stronger forms of the paradox,\nthough, validity curry, seem to show that dropping these\nprinciples is not enough (Beall and Murzi 2013). This leads to\ncontraction-free logics within the broader family of\n substructural logics\n (Restall 2000, Priest 2015), and indeed substructural dialetheic\napproaches that drop principles other than contraction, such as\ntransitivity (Ripley 2012). Curry\u2019s paradox puts pressure on the\ndialetheic story about uniform solution to the paradoxes. Beall\n(2014a, 2014b) urges this point; Weber et al 2014 is a reply. \n3.4 Other Motivations for Dialetheism\n\nDialetheias produced by the paradoxes of self-reference are confined\nto the abstract realm of notions such as set or to semantic\nconcepts such as truth. However, the paradoxes of\nself-reference are not the only examples of dialetheias that have been\nmooted. Other cases involve contradictions affecting concrete objects\nand the empirical world, and include the following.\n\n(1) Transition states: when I exit the room, I am inside the\nroom at one time, and outside of it at another. Given the continuity\nof motion, there must be a precise instant in time, call it \\(t\\), at\nwhich I leave the room. Am I inside the room or outside at time \\(t\\)?\nFour answers are available: (a) I am inside; (b) I am outside; (c) I\nam both; and (d) I am neither. There is a strong intuition that (a)\nand (b) are ruled out by symmetry considerations: choosing either\nwould be completely arbitrary. (This intuition is not at all unique to\ndialetheists: see the article on\n boundaries\n in general.) As for (d): if I am neither inside not outside the room,\nthen I am not inside and not-not inside; therefore, I am either inside\nand not inside (option (c)), or not inside and not-not inside (which\nfollows from option (d)); in both cases, a dialetheic situation. Or so\nit has been argued. For a description of inconsistent boundaries using\nformal mereology, see Weber and Cotnoir 2015.\n\n(2) Some of Zeno\u2019s paradoxes concerning a\nparticular\u2014though, perhaps, the most basic\u2014kind of\ntransition, that is, local motion: a moving arrow is both\nwhere it is, and where it is not. In any given instant, argues Zeno,\nit cannot move to where it is, since it is already there, and it\ncannot move to somewhere else, because there isn\u2019t time for it\nto get there. The orthodox way out of the paradoxical situation, as\nformulated, e.g., by Russell 1903, has it that motion is the mere\noccupation of different places at different times. But one could argue\nthat this is denial of the phenomenon itself, that is, of the\nactuality of motion: Russell\u2019s solution entails that motion is\nnot an intrinsic state of the (allegedly) moving thing, for,\nat each instant, the arrow is not moving at all. Can a going-somewhere\nbe composed by an (even continuum-sized) infinity of going-nowheres?\nAn alternative, dialetheic account of motion, which takes at face\nvalue the aforementioned Hegelian idea that \u201cSomething moves,\nnot because at one moment it is here and another there, but because at\none and the same moment it is here and not here, because in this\n\u2018here\u2019, it at once is and is not\u201d, is exposed in\nPriest 1987, Ch. 12.\n\n(3) Borderline cases of vague predicates. Popular approaches\nto\n vagueness\n and the\n sorites paradox,\n such as the ones based on many-valued logics, or supervaluations,\nrequire some under-determinacy of reference, and/or the rejection of\nBivalence: if an adolescent, \\(m\\), is a borderline case of adultness,\n\\(A\\), then \\(A(m)\\) may turn out to have an intermediate truth value\nbetween truth and falsity, or no truth value at all. But it may be\nconjectured that a borderline object like \\(m\\), instead of satisfying\nneither a vague predicate nor its negation, satisfies them both: an\nadolescent both is and is not an adult. Given the obvious dualities\nbetween the LEM and the Law of Bivalence on the one side, and\n(respectively, syntactic and semantic formulations of) the LNC on the\nother, it is not too difficult to envisage a\n\u2018sub-valuational\u2019 semantic approach, dual to the\nsupervaluation strategy. Sub-valuational paraconsistent semantics have\nbeen proposed by Hyde (1997), and Varzi (1997). Other\n\u2018glutty\u2019 approaches to vagueness have been proposed by\nColyvan (2009), Weber (2010), Priest (2010), Ripley (2013), and\nCobreros et al (2010, 2015), motivated on both theoretical and\nempirical grounds. If inconsistencies due to vague predicates and\nborderline objects are taken to be due to merely semantic under- and\nover- determination of ordinary language (de dicto), then\nthis is further evidence for dialetheism about semantics. If the\naforementioned phenomena are taken to be not just about words but\nthings (de re), then actually inconsistent objects are\nadmitted, together with vague objects. And this spreads inconsistency\nall over the empirical world: if borderline cases can be inconsistent,\ninconsistent objects are more or less everywhere, given how pervasive\nthe phenomenon of vagueness notoriously is: adolescents, borderline\nbald men, etc. Inconsistency is observable (Beall and Colyvan\n2001). Beall argues against the approach in Ch. 5 of Beall 2009, and\nBeall 2014a.\n\n(4) Multi-criterial predicates. We may assume that the\nsemantics of a predicate is specified by means of its criteria of\napplication. Now ordinary language hosts predicates with different,\nand occasionally conflicting, criteria of application (e.g.,\n\u2018left wing\u2019): some criteria for applying a predicate \\(P\\)\n(e.g., caring about social welfare, raising minimum wages) may entail\nthat object \\(m\\) (e.g., a political party) is in the extension of the\npredicate, some others (promoting nationalism, oppressing immigrants),\nthat \\(m\\) is in its anti-extension, or negative extension. Criteria\ncan in some cases be encoded by such things as meaning postulates (or\nother similar, albeit more sophisticated, semantic devices); but\nconflicting meaning postulates may be embedded in our standard\nlinguistic practices, and difficult to detect and identify. If the\nextensions of our ordinary predicates are constrained by our\nintuitions, and such intuitions turn out to be inconsistent, a good\nsemantic account of the situation may well have to reflect this fact\n(accepting, in our example, that a party counts as both left and right\nwing), instead of destroying it by means of some regimentation (e.g.\nvia the usual parameterisation, or distinction of respects). As Priest\n1987, pp 67\u20139, clarifies, it is also hard to analyse such\nsituations as cases of vagueness (so that a party has to be understood\nas being left wing to some degree, and right wing to some degree).\n\n(5) Certain legal situations, such as inconsistent bodies of\nlaw. Suppose, for instance, that some norm states that a marriage\nperformed by the captain of a ship counts as a legal marriage only if\nthe ship was in open water throughout the ceremony. It turns out,\nthen, that some other law has established that such a marriage is\nvalid also if the ceremony has only begun with the ship in open water,\nbut has ended with the ship in the port. Then someone may turn out to\nbe both a married man and not a married man. (Since it does not appear\nto follow that he is not a man anymore, or both a man and not a man,\nwe have another putative counterexample to ex contradictione\nquodlibet). If one accepts the plausible view that statements\nconcerning legal rights, obligations, and statuses, can be truth-value\napt, we seem to have a dialetheia. Of course, legal systems sometimes\nhave mechanisms that can be used to remove such inconsistencies (e.g.,\nby ordering different kinds of laws in a hierarchy from customary\nlaws, to established jurisprudence, to ordinary legislation, to\nconstitutional norms, etc.; or via the lex posterior\nprinciple, giving priority to the more recent norm in case of\nconflict). But this is not always the case: the inconsistent laws may\nbe of the same rank, enacted at the same time, etc. For a recent\ndiscussion, see Beall 2016.\n\n(6) In post-Kantian metaphysics, a movement sometimes dubbed\n\u2018new realism\u2019 or \u2018speculative realism\u2019 has\ndeveloped, in various work by Quentin Meillassoux, Graham Harman,\nMarkus Gabriel, and others. The idea is that much of philosophy since\nKant, especially in the continential tradition, has been lost in\npostmodernist concern with thought and language, and that a return to\nthe \u201cGreat Outdoors\u201d is overdue. The return to realism\nthough is speculative in the sense that it continues to take seriously\nepistemic concerns: in Harman\u2019s case at least, mind-independent\nobjects will be radically resistant to knowledge and almost impossibly\nremoved from us. If such a realism involves specifying objects or\nmaking knowledge claims about them that the theory itself seems to\npreclude, then, much as with the paradoxes at the limit of thought\n(presented in section 2.1 above), this may crucially involve\ncontradiction. Some practitioners in this area have explicitly\nendorsed dialetheism, e.g. Morton 2012. Cogburn has identified in this\napproach what he dubs the \u2018object oriented ontology\u2019\nparadox (as fitting Priest\u2019s inclosure schema): \u201cTo the\nextent that object-oriented ontologists really are offering\nspeculative systems of metaphysics, they seem to be trying to do what\nthey themselves take to be impossible\u201d (Cogburn 2017, chapter 3;\nsee 3.3 above).\n\n(7) It has long been recognized that theology may involve\nparadoxes. In traditional Western monotheism, various divine\nattributes appear to be logically inconsistent. Famously, the question\nof whether an omnipotent God can create a stone so heavy He Himself\ncannot lift seems to lead to a contradiction\u2014something that is\nboth possible and not possible for God. Cotnoir 2018 explores whether\ndialetheism and the tools of paraconsistent logic provide a plausible\nresponse to these paradoxes, namely, to accept their conclusions.\nBeall 2021 focuses more specifically on Christianity and the apparent\ncontradiction that Jesus Christ was both mortal (and limited) but also\ndivine (and so immortal and unlimited), with the suggestion that this\ncan best be accommodated as a truth glut. Weber 2019 expresses\ndisagreement with theological applications of dialetheism. \n\nEach of the above topics undoubtedly call for further development. See\nPriest 1987 or Ficara 2014. This list is also not exhaustive. For\nexample, some\n connexive logics\n are contra-classical (they validate classically invalid arguments)\nand are even contradictory in their propositional fragment. That is,\nwhereas most motivations for dialetheism come from non-logical\nsources, connexive logic is dialetheic at the most basic logical\nlevel; see Omori and Wansing 2019. Or, for both a motivation and\napplication of dialetheism, Casati 2021 argues for a dialetheic\ninterpretation of the late Heidegger in which Being itself is both an\nentity and not an entity, and that this can be made sense of through\nmereology and metaphysical grounding. \n4. Objections to Dialetheism\n\nWe now turn to arguments against dialetheism. The most prominent\nsustained defence of the LNC in the history of philosophy is, as\nmentioned,\n that given by Aristotle\n in Chapter 4 of Metaphysics, \\(\\Gamma\\). A critical analysis\nof Aristotle\u2019s arguments is given point-for-point by Priest\n(1998b/2006 ch.1), who finds them to often conflate dialetheism with\ntrivialism (that is, conflating the claim that some contradictions are\ntrue, and the one that all contradictions are). We will look at some\nmore modern arguments against dialetheism.\n4.1 The Argument from Explosion\n\nA standard argument against dialetheism is to invoke the logical\nprinciple of Explosion, in virtue of which dialetheism would entail\ntrivialism. Granted that trivialism is absurd (though see Priest\n2000a, Priest 2006, Ch. 3, and Kabay 2010), dialetheism must be\nrejected. Since this argument assumes that explosion is logically\nvalid, it will carry no weight against a dialetheic\nparaconsistentist.\n\nInterestingly enough, while Aristotle\u2019s defence of the LNC may\nslide between attacking dialetheism and trivialism, Aristotelian\nsyllogistic\u2014the first formally articulated logic in Western\nphilosophy\u2014is not explosive. Aristotle held that some syllogisms\nwith inconsistent premises are valid, whereas others are not (An. Pr.\n64a 15). Just consider the inference:\n\n(P1) Some logicians are intuitionists;\n\n(P2) No intuitionist is a logician;\n\n(C) Therefore, all logicians are logicians.\n\nThis is not a valid syllogism, despite the fact that its premises are\ninconsistent. The principle of Explosion had a certain tenure at\nplaces and times in Medieval logic, but it became well-established\nmainly with the Fregean and post-Fregean development of what is now\ncalled classical logic. For the logical aspects of denying explosion,\nsee the article on paraconsistent logic.\n4.2 The Argument from Exclusion\n\nThere are several objections to dialetheism involving the notion of\nexclusion. The very rough idea is that dialetheists have let\nin more truths than non-dialetheists, but subsequently now\nhave trouble keeping enough falisity out. This objection, in\none form or another, has been a recurring theme in criticisms of\ndialetheism. \n\nA version of the argument from exclusion against dialetheism found,\nfor instance, in McTaggart 1922 (see Berto 2006, 2012) is as follows.\nA sentence is meaningful only if it rules something out. But if the\nLNC fails, \\(A\\) does not rule out \\(\\neg A\\), or, a\nfortiori, anything else. Hence meaningful language presupposes\nthe LNC.\n\nThere are problems one may find with this argument. One is that even\nthough a dialetheia does not rule out its negation, it still may rule\nout several other things. A bigger trouble is that the first premise\nlooks to be simply false. Consider again the sentence\n\u2018Everything is true\u2019. This entails everything, and so\nrules out nothing. Yet it is meaningful. It is something that\neveryone, except a trivialist, rejects.\n\nOne might attempt a more sophisticated explanation of the notion of\nruling out, for instance in terms of information theory, or\nperhaps possible worlds. One may claim that a statement \u2018rules\nout\u2019 something insofar as there are situations, or worlds, at\nwhich it fails. In this sense, \u2018Everything is true\u2019 does\nrule something out. But now, it is this account of propositional\nmeaning which can be challenged in general. If mathematical truths\nhave a strictly necessary status (which may safely be assumed here),\nFermat\u2019s Last Theorem rules out nothing: being a necessary\ntruth, it holds at all possible worlds. But it is perfectly\nmeaningful; people wondered whether it was true or false for\ncenturies; and its proof by Andrew Wiles was a substantial\ndiscovery.\n\nOne argument from exclusion, with a more ad hominem twist,\nclaims that the dialetheist has trouble with expressing\ndisagreement with rival positions in debates (see Parsons 1990,\nShapiro 2004, Littman and Simmons 2004). For when the dialetheist\nutters \u2018\\(\\neg A\\)\u2019, this is in itself insufficient to\nrule out that \\(A\\) is the case, given that, in a dialetheic world, it\nmay well be that both \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\). Similarly, \u2018\\(A\\) is\nfalse\u2019 and even \u2018\\(A\\) is not true\u2019 might not do the\ntrick, since for the dialetheist some \\(A\\)\u2019s being false, or\nuntrue, does not rule out its being true. As Parsons puts it,\n\nSuppose that you say \u2018\\(A\\)\u2019 and Priest replies\n\u2018\\(\\neg A\\)\u2019. Under ordinary circumstances you would think\nthat he had disagreed with you. But then you remember that Priest is a\ndialetheist, and it occurs to you that he might very well agree with\nyou after all\u2014since he might think that \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\) are\nboth true. How can he indicate that he genuinely disagrees\nwith you? The natural choice is for him to say \u2018\\(A\\) is not\ntrue\u2019. However, the truth of this assertion is also consistent\nwith \\(A\\)\u2019s being true\u2014for a dialetheist, anyway (Parsons\n1990, p. 345).\n\n\nElaborations and repetitions of this line of thought have come to be\nknown in the literature as the \u2018just true\u2019 or \u2018true\nonly\u2019 problem, e.g. Rossberg 2013. (Young 2015, however, argues\nthat the exclusion problem is distinct from the just-true problem.)\n\n\nTo this, the dialetheist has various replies. Priest has argued that\nthe logical operation of negation should be distinguished from the\nspeech acts of denial and the cognitive state of rejection. So, contra\nFrege, assertion of a negation is not the same as denial. The idea is\nthat exclusion is expressed via a primitive notion of\nrejection: to reject \\(A\\) is to positively refuse to believe\nthat \\(A\\). That the notion is taken as primitive means, in\nparticular, that it is not reducible to the acceptance of negation: it\nis a sui generis act. The linguistic counterpart of rejection\nis the speech act of denial. Then the dialetheist can rule out that\n\\(A\\) is the case by denying \\(A\\); and this does not amount to the\nassertion of \\(\\neg A\\) (Priest 2006, Ch. 6). More simply, one can\noften express denials by uttering ordinary language negations:\n\u2018not\u2019 is, in this sense, pragmatically ambiguous.\nWe will come back below to how, and why, rejection-denial may not be\nreducible to the acceptance-assertion of any negation.\n\nAnother way in which the dialetheist may express the exclusion that\n\\(A\\) is the case is by uttering \u2018\\(A \\rightarrow \\bot\\)\u2019,\nwhere again \\(\\bot\\) is \u2018Everything is true\u2019. Similarly, a\ndialetheist may try to fix that \\(A\\) is consistent by saying\n\u2018if \\(A\\) is both true and false, then \\(\\bot\\)\u2019.\nConsiderations by e.g. Field (2008, Ch. 27), Murzi and Carrara (2013),\nand Berto (2014), however, cast doubt on whether\n\u2018arrow-falsum\u2019 can work as a dialetheic\nexclusion-expressing device in all cases. One reason is due to\nside-effects of the aforementioned Curry paradox. Another is that\n\u2018arrow-falsum\u2019 is very strong; a mundane sentence\nlike \u2018Alice had spaghetti for dinner\u2019 may be false-only\n(she didn\u2019t), but if it were true too, that wouldn\u2019t be\nabsurd. Cf. Beall 2013, proposing exclusion via non-logical,\ntheory-specific rules of the form \\(A,\\neg A \\vdash \\bot\\)\nfor each sentence \\(A\\) we take to be consistent; Scharp 2018 suggests\npossible problems for this approach. \n\nThe exclusion problem gets its strength from some background\nassumptions. Specifically, it seems to presuppose that the content of\na proposition is given in terms of splitting all possible situations,\nor worlds, into those where the proposition holds and those where it\ndoes not. Even accepting this presupposition, though, would not affect\na dialetheic challenge to the LNC. For a given \\(A\\) to be a\ndialetheia, putting things in these terms, it is sufficient that there\nbe overlap between the worlds where \\(A\\) holds, and those where its\nnegation holds. And this is compatible with the idea of propositional\ncontent as splitting the totality of worlds\u2014but now with\noverlap. The tenability of such an overlap, though, requires\ndiscussing the account of negation from classical logic, to which we\nnow turn.\n4.3 The Argument from Negation\n\nArguments against dialetheism are often focused on the concept of\nlogical negation. The main one goes as follows. The truth conditions\nfor negation are: \\(\\neg A\\) is true iff \\(A\\) is not true. Hence, if\n\\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\) were true, \\(A\\) would be both true and not true,\nwhich is impossible.\n\nWhat to make of this argument? First, the truth conditions for\nnegation employed here are contentious. An alternative view has it\nthat \\(\\neg A\\) is true iff \\(A\\) is false, and \\(\\neg A\\) is false\niff \\(A\\) is true\u2014and in the semantics of many paraconsistent\nlogics (for instance, the logic of First Degree Entailment), truth and\nfalsity may overlap. Such an account preserves our intuition that\nnegation is the operator which (truth-functionally) switches truth and\nfalsity. It also preserves our intuition on contradictoriness, in the\nform: \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are contradictories iff, if \\(A\\) is true, \\(B\\)\nis false, and if \\(A\\) is false, \\(B\\) is true. What has to go, on\nthis proposal, is the assumption that truth and falsity are exclusive\nin all cases: there exist dialetheias, that is, sentences falling\nsimultaneously under both categories.\n\nSecondly, a dialetheist can point out that the argument against\ndialetheism based on the truth conditions for (classical) negation\nbegs the question at its last step: why should we assume that it is\nimpossible for \\(A\\) to be both true and not true? Well, because it is\na contradiction. But that is precisely what is at issue; the critic\nwas supposed to be arguing for the impossibility of any contradiction\nholding to begin with. In fact, the dialetheist may even\naccept a characterisation of the truth conditions for\nnegation as: \u2018\\(\\neg A\\) is true iff \\(A\\) is not true\u2019.\nFor if the \u2018metalanguage\u2019 in which the characterisation is\nexpressed can be inconsistent in its turn, as a thoroughgoing\ndialetheist is likely to allow (as in Weber et al 2016), then there is\nno guarantee that the \u2018not\u2019 in that clause behaves\nconsistently. So the debate comes back to the basic question of\nwhether or not consistency can be presupposed.\n\nA variant on the anti-dialetheic argument from negation comes from a\nQuinean conception of logical vocabulary. It goes as follows. Even\ngranting that there is an operator, say, \\(*\\), which behaves as\ndialetheists claim (namely, such that in particular in some cases\n\\(A\\) is true together with \\(*A)\\), it is still perfectly possible to\ndefine a negation with all the properties of classical\nnegation; in particular, the property of being explosive. And since\nclassical negation is the standard operator in logic, it is misleading\nto translate anything non-classical as \u2018not\u2019: such a\ntranslation risks simply calling \u2018negation\u2019 something\ndifferent. A change in logical vocabulary is a \u201cchange of\nsubject\u201d, as the Quinean slogan goes. A version of this\nobjection to dialetheism is due to Slater (1995); see also Restall\n1993.\n\nOne line of reply to the Quinean objection available to the\ndialetheist is that the objection is confused between a logical theory\nand what the theory is a theory of. There are many different and\nwell-worked out logical theories of negation (minimal negation,\nintuitionistic negation, De Morgan negation, etc.). Insofar as each\none of them characterizes its own theoretical object, there is no\nrivalry between logics. Rivalry begins when we wonder whether some\naccount or other captures the meaning and functioning of negation as\nit is used in the vernacular. An applied account of negation is a\ntheory of something, and the theoretical object has to fit\nthe real object. Now, to assume beforehand that the classical account\nof negation is the correct one, in the sense that it captures how\nnegation works in the vernacular, again begs the question against the\ndialetheist (and, indeed, against most non-classical logicians): it is\ncircular just to assume that classical negation gets it\nright. People who propose a treatment of negation alternative to the\nclassical one are not thereby proposing to revise negation,\nbut to revise an account of it, which they consider incorrect.\n\nIf it is agreed that a fair discussion between dialetheists and\nnon-dialetheists cannot presuppose one account of negation over the\nother, then this suggests a simpler reply from dialetheists to the\njust-true/exclusion problems from 4.2 above. The reply now is to demur\nfrom the presuppositions of the just-true/exclusion objections.\nWithout begging any questions one way or the other, this reply goes,\nall agree that for a sentence to be just-true amounts to it being true\nand not false, and just-false being false and not true. Then as Priest\nputs it (Priest 1987, p.291 of 2006 edition),\n\nA dialetheist can express the claim that something, \\(A\\), is not\ntrue\u2014in those very words, \\(\\neg Tr\\langle A \\rangle\\). What she\ncannot do is ensure that the words she utters behave consistently:\neven if \\(\\neg Tr\\langle A\\rangle\\) holds, \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg Tr\\langle\nA\\rangle\\) may yet hold.\n\n\nIn the exclusion objection, it appears that the dialetheist is being\nasked to ensure that the words she utters behave\nconsistently\u2014which is exactly what is at issue. (See Restall\n2010 and the reply in Beall et al 2011 for one round of this sort of\ndiscussion.) A dialetheist goes on to question why one should think\nthat commitment to an explosive logic is, in itself, a guard against\ncontradiction, and therefore why dialetheists are supposed to be in\nspecial difficulty with respect to the exclusion question any more\nthan a non-dialetheist. Filling in the details here will vary, but the\nreply, in short, is for a dialetheist as with anyone else,\n\u2018just-true\u2019 is just \u2018true\u2019 (Beall 2009, p.\n54). For elaboration of a dialetheic solution to the \u2018just\ntrue\u2019 problem see Omori and Weber 2019. \n\nOne final way this same sort of objection is expressed is by asking\ndialetheists for some way to sort the true-only sentences from the\ntrue-and-false sentences:\n\nI often find myself being asked the following question: \u2018Since\nyou believe some contradictions, but not all, you must have a\ncriterion for deciding between those that are true and those that are\nnot. What is it?\u2019 In reply I usually point out that the\nquestioner believes some things are true, but not all, and ask them\nwhat criterion they have for deciding between those things that are\ntrue and those that are not. The answer, I think, is the same in both\ncases. Nice as it would be to have a criterion of truth, to expect one\nwould seem utopian. One has to treat each case on its merits, whether\nthe proposition concerned is a contradiction or some other thing\n(Priest 2006 p. 56).\n\n\nPriest\u2019s suggestion is that dialetheists are working with truth\nand falsity, just like non-dialetheists. Accounts of negation differ,\nbut this on its own does not create any special obligations on the\npart of dialetheists.\n5. Dialetheism and Rationality Let us turn from some basic objections to dialetheism to\nconcerns that arise in relation to pragmatics and rationality.\n\n5.1 Consistency and Other Epistemic Virtues\n\nSome have felt that what is wrong with dialetheism is not so much\nviolation of the LNC itself, as that an acceptance of the LNC is a\nprecondition for rationality. For example, it is often suggested that\nit could not possibly be rational to accept a contradiction.\n\nIt is a matter of ongoing debate what the conditions are under which\nit is rational to accept something. Nevertheless, it is commonly\nagreed that, as Hume put it, the wise person \u201cproportions his\nbeliefs to the evidence\u201d (1955, p. 118). If this is right, then\nif a sufficient case can be made out for a contradiction, it will be\nrational to believe it. And sometimes this does seem possible. We have\nseen that a seemingly compelling argument can be made in favour of the\ntruth of the strengthened Liar sentence, \u2018This sentence is not\ntrue\u2019. Whether or not one takes the argument in question to be\ncompletely persuasive, it suggests that there is nothing in principle\nimpossible about the existence of good arguments for true\ncontradictions. Of course, if there were conclusive evidence for the\nLNC, then no case for a contradiction could be strong enough. But\nconclusive evidence for any philosophical position is difficult to\nachieve.\n\nA more persuasive worry about dialetheism, relating to rationality, is\nthe claim that if a person could legitimately accept a contradiction,\nthen no one could be forced, rationally, to abandon any view\nheld. For if a person accepts \\(A\\) then, when an argument for \\(\\neg\nA\\) is put up, they could simply accept both \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\).\n\nA dialetheist can reply that, again, not all contradictions are equal.\nEach sentence, including each contradiction, is evaluated on its\nmerits. While a case can be made for the claim that the Liar sentence\nis both true and false, but this in no way shows that a case can also\nbe made for Brisbane being and not being in Australia. (Of course, if\none subscribes to the claim that entailment is explosive, a case for\none contradiction is a case for all; but if entailment is\nparaconsistent, this argument is of no use.) \n\nAs orthodox philosophy of science indicates, there are, in fact, many\ndifferent considerations that speak for or against the rational\nacceptability of a theory or a view. Among the epistemic virtues of a\ntheory are: its adequacy to the data; its simplicity, cleanness and\nelegance; its unity and freedom from ad hoc hypotheses; its\nexplanatory and predictive power; etc. Not only do these (and other)\ncriteria come in degrees, but they may also be orthogonal to each\nother. In the end, the rational evaluation of a view must balance it\nagainst all criteria of this kind (of which, consistency is, arguably,\none), each, on its own, being defeasible. \n\nDialetheism asks us to consider the possibility that a theory lacking\nthe virtue of consistency may still overcomes its rivals in all or\nmost of the other respects. According to dialetheists, this is\nactually the case with the dialetheic account of the semantics of\nordinary language, whose advantages with respect to consistent\naccounts have already been shortly suggested above. And conversely, of\ncourse, an inconsistent theory may well be trumped by a consistent\ntheory, all things considered. So it may be rational to reject an\ninconsistent position, even if it is logically possible that it is\ntrue. Rationality considerations are dealt with at length in Priest\n2006. \n5.2 Accepting and Asserting Dialetheias\n\nIf some contradictions are true, it is natural to expect that a\ndialetheist will sometimes accept, or believe in, contradictions, and\nassert them. Priest (2006, p. 109) adopts the following Rationality\nPrinciple:\n\n(RP) If you have good evidence for the truth of \\(A\\), you ought to\naccept \\(A\\). \n\nBelief, acceptance, and assertion have a point: when we\nbelieve and assert, what we aim at is believing and asserting what is\nthe case or, equivalently, the truth. Therefore, the dialetheist will\naccept and, sometimes, assert both \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\), if she has\nevidence that \\(A\\) is a dialetheia.\n\nNotice that this need not entail that the dialetheist both accepts\nand rejects \\(A\\) at the same time. We now come back to the\nissue flagged in Section 4.2, on the irreducibility of rejection to\nnegation. That rejecting \\(A\\) is tantamount to accepting its negation\nis a common view, famously endorsed and defended (more precisely in\nterms of the corresponding speech acts of assertion and denial) by\nFrege and Peter Geach. But dialetheists have argued that this fusion\nis a confusion (see Berto 2008 on this issue). The point can be made\nindependently of the issue of dialetheism: a paracompletist may well\nwant to deny \\(A\\), but it would be unfair to take such a denial as\nequivalent to the assertion of \\(\\neg A\\), since if \\(A\\) is\ntruth-valueless, \\(\\neg A\\) is normally considered truth-valueless,\ntoo, not a truth, and so not to be asserted. A dual position can hold\nfor dialetheism: given that accepting \\(\\neg A\\) is different from\nrejecting \\(A\\), a dialetheist can do the former and not the\nlatter\u2014exactly when she thinks that \\(A\\) is a dialetheia.\n\nDoes this show that dialetheism is compatible with rationality? The\nstory about assertion and denial, acceptance and rejection has been\nchallenged from several directions. We will just mention a few. \n\nRestall (2015) argues that the the acceptance/rejection issue makes\ngappy and glutty approaches symmterical: gap theorists cannot assert\nsome true claims about paradoxes, but glut theorists cannot reject\nsome false claims about non-paradoxes; see also Restall 2013, Jenny\n2017. In a note by Laura Goodship (1996), she suggests that the\nproposal of separating denial from assertion of negation runs into\nproblems related, again, to Curry\u2019s paradox. Her proposal is, in\neffect, that it would be more natural for dialetheists to both accept\nand reject things after all. Focusing on the phenomenon of\ndisagreement in natural language, Ripley (2015a) argues that\ndialetheists (and paracompleteists) should rejoin classical logicians\nin taking negation to embed denial, and denial to express\ndisagreement. Ripley proposes that dialetheists simply admit that (1)\nagreement and disagreement are incompatible\n(\u201cit\u2019s incoherent to do both\u201d, p. 306), but (2) in\nsome cases, assert and deny the same thing. The result would be what\nRipley calls paracoherentism, which (in echo of\nparaconsistency) would try to allow local incoherence without global\nincoherence. How this could be done is an open question. Ripley\nsuggests dropping the transitivity of logical consequence. Goodship\nherself ultimately recommends dropping modus ponens, a proposal that\nhas been dubbed the \u2018Goodship project\u2019 (Beall 2015, Omori\n2016, Priest 2017). \n\nThere certainly are various other arguments against dialetheism in the\nphilosophical market (see papers in Priest et al. 2004). For example,\nZalta (2004, p. 432) argues that preserving \u201cour pretheoretic\nunderstanding of what it is to exemplify or instantiate a\nproperty\u201d requires us to preserve the LNC. This entry has\npresented only some of the most immediate issues that arise in\nobjections and replies.\n6. Themes for Further Research\n\nSince dialetheism is simply a claim about truth, it can play a role in\nany area\u2014say in traditional or mainstream philosophy\u2014where \ntruth is involved. Among such topics, a prominent one is the\ndebate between\n realists\n and\n anti-realists\n (for example, idealists and constructivists) in metaphysics. Very\nroughly, to be a realist about entities of some kind is to\nmaintain that such entities objectively exist apart from, and\nantecedently to, anyone\u2019s thought of them; and, therefore, that\nour thoughts, beliefs and theories concerning such entities are made\nobjectively true or objectively false by them, apart from what we\nthink of them (more refined definitions of realism and anti-realism\nare certainly available; but this characterization will suffice for\nour purposes).\n\nIt has been claimed (Priest 2000b, Priest 2006, Ch. 2) that\ndialetheism is not by itself committed to a specific conception of\ntruth (deflationist, semantic, correspondentist, coherentist,\nconstructivist, etc.).\n\nIf something is true, there must be something that makes it so. Call\nthis the world. If some contradictions are true, then the world must\nbe such as to make this the case. In this sense, the world is\ncontradictory. What it is in the world that makes something true is\nanother matter (Priest, 2006, p.299).\n\n\nNevertheless, if we accept even a mild form of realism,\nthe truth of some contradictions entails the existence of inconsistent\nobjects and/or states of affairs: those that make the contradictions\ntrue (Berto 2007b). One may claim that it makes no sense to talk of\ninconsistent objects, situations, or states of affairs. The world is\nall there, all together: how could some pieces of it\ncontradict some other pieces? Consistency and inconsistency\nmight be taken as properties of sentences, or theories (sets of\nsentences closed under logical consequence), or propositions (what\nsentences express), or maybe thoughts, or (sets of) beliefs, etc.\nContradiction (Widerspruch, the Latin contradictio)\nhas to do with discourse (diction, sprechen,\ndicere). The world, with its non-mental and non-linguistic\ninhabitants\u2014armchairs, trees, people\u2014is not the right\nkind of thing that can be consistent or inconsistent, and\nascribing such properties to (a part of) the world is, to use Gilbert\nRyle\u2019s terminology, a category mistake.\n\n\nThese considerations might drive dialetheism towards an anti-realist\ninterpretation of the claim that there are dialetheias, true\ncontradictions; and anti-realist dialetheic theories of truth have, in\nfact, been proposed (see e.g. Beall\u2019s \u2018constructive\nmethodological deflationism\u2019, in Beall 2004). But other options\nare available to a dialetheist who wants to embrace some form of\nmetaphysically robust realism about truth. For instance, she can\nstress that consistency and inconsistency can be ascribed to (pieces\nof) the world in a derived sense: to say that the world is\n(locally) inconsistent just is to say that some true purely\ndescriptive sentences about the world have true negations.\nConsequently, and not accidentally, it is quite common in the current\nliterature both for and against dialetheism to straightforwardly speak\nof inconsistent objects, states of affairs, and entire inconsistent\nworlds. A dialetheic correspondence theory of truth might be\ncommitted, in particular, to negative facts (requiring the\nsimultaneous existence of truth-makers both for \\(A\\) and for its\nnegation, when \\(A\\) is a dialetheia); but these may be not too\ndifficult to handle (see e.g. Priest 2006, pp. 51\u20133).\n\nThere are further intermediate positions. One is \u2018semantic\ndialetheism\u2019 which accepts true contradictions without\ninconsistent objects or states of affairs as their truth-makers. This\nposition has been explored in the literature (Kroon 2004, Mares 2004).\nBeall\u2019s view, expressed in his transparent truth theory in Beall\n2009, may also be seen as a form of semantic dialetheism. Transparency\ncan be naturally paired with a\n deflationary view of truth.\n For suppose the truth predicate is a merely semantic device, coined,\nas Quine famously stressed, for expressive,\n\u2018disquotational\u2019 purposes. Then dialetheias such as the\nLiar(s) may well be semantic side-effects (\u2018spandrels\u2019, in\nBeall\u2019s terminology) of the introduction of such device, not\ninvolving any metaphysically committing contradiction in a language-\nand mind- independent world. Woodbridge and Armour-Garb (2013) argue\nthat a deflationary view of truth is best understood in terms of\nsemantic pretense (a hermeneutic fictionalist perspective), and on\nthat basis offered a pretense account of the semantic paradoxes.\nWansing (2022) advances a view called dimathematism, where\nthere may be contradictions in information (information being\n\u201cwhat is left from knowledge when you subtract, justification,\ntruth, and belief\u201d as Dunn puts it) again distinct from\ncontradictions in truth. \n\nDebates on realism and anti-realism quickly spill over into questions\nconcerning the nature of reality in general. Thus the dialetheic\nprogramme looks to metaphysical issues: if reality is dialetheic, how\nshould the ontology of a dialetheic world be spelt out? If metaphysics\nshould be placed (once again) at the very core of philosophy, the\ndebate on the possibility of dialetheias occupies a central place in\nthe core. This was, after all, Aristotle\u2019s view, too: he decided\nto speak on behalf of the unconditional validity of the LNC, not in\nhis Organon (his writings on the subject of logic), but in\nthe Metaphysics, for this was for him an issue to be\naddressed ontologically, not (only) via formal logical tools. For work\nin dialetheic metaphysics see Priest 2014, which grounds the very\nunity of objects in an inconsistent theory of parthood and boundary,\nand applies it to classic problems such as the One and the Many, and\nthe instantiation of universals.\n7. Conclusion\n\nSince Aristotle, the assumption that consistency is a requirement for\ntruth, validity, meaning, and rationality, has gone largely\nunchallenged. Modern investigations into dialetheism, in pressing the\npossibility of inconsistent theories that are nevertheless meaningful,\nvalid, rational, and true, call that assumption into question. If\nconsistency does turn out to be a necessary condition for any of these\nnotions, dialetheism prompts us to articulate why; just by pushing\nphilosophers to find arguments for what previously were undisputed\nbeliefs renders a valuable service (Scharp 2007, p. 544). And if\nconsistency turns out not to be an essential requirement for all\ntheories, then the way is open for the rational exploration of areas\nin philosophy and the sciences that have traditionally been closed\noff. \n",
