    "main_text": "\n\nWe believe that we have free will and this belief is so firmly\nentrenched in our daily lives that it is almost impossible to take\nseriously the thought that it might be mistaken. We deliberate and\nmake choices, for instance, and in so doing we assume that there is\nmore than one choice we can make, more than one action we are able to\nperform. When we look back and regret a foolish choice, or blame\nourselves for not doing something we should have done, we assume that\nwe could have chosen and done otherwise. When we look forward and make\nplans for the future, we assume that we have at least some control\nover our actions and the course of our lives; we think it is at least\nsometimes up to us what we choose and try to do.\n\nDeterminism is a highly general claim about the universe: very\nroughly, that everything that happens, including everything you choose\nand do, is determined by facts about the past together with the laws.\nDeterminism isn\u2019t part of common sense, and it is not easy to\ntake seriously the thought that it might, for all we know, be true.\nThe incompatibilist believes that if determinism turned out to be\ntrue, our belief that we have free will would be false. The\ncompatibilist denies that the truth of determinism would have this\ndrastic consequence. According to the compatibilist, the truth of\ndeterminism is compatible with the truth of our belief that we have\nfree will. The philosophical problem of free will and determinism is\nthe problem of deciding who is right: the compatibilist or the\nincompatibilist.\n\nMuch of the philosophical interest in the free will/determinism\nproblem is motivated by concerns about moral responsibility because,\nit is generally agreed, having free will is a necessary condition of\nbeing morally responsible. So if determinism precludes free will, it\nalso precludes moral responsibility. But it\u2019s important to\ndistinguish questions about free will (whether we have it, what it\namounts to, whether it is compatible with determinism, whether it is\ncompatible with other things we believe true) from questions about\nmoral responsibility. Someone might believe that we have free will and\nthat free will is compatible with determinism while also believing,\nfor other reasons, that no one is ever morally responsible. And\nsomeone might believe that we don\u2019t have free will (because of\ndeterminism or something else) while also believing, against\nconventional wisdom, that we are nevertheless morally responsible.\nWhat one believes about determinism and moral responsibility will\ndepend, in large part, on what one believes about various matters\nwithin the scope of ethics rather than metaphysics. Among other\nthings, it will depend on what one takes moral responsibility to be\n(P. Strawson 1962; G. Strawson 1986, 1994; Scanlon 2008; Watson 1996,\n2004; Wolf 1990). For these reasons it is important not to conflate\nthe question of the compatibility of free will and determinism with\nthe question of whether moral responsibility is compatible with\ndeterminism.\n\nIt must be acknowledged that a change in definitions has crept into\nthe literature, and many contemporary theorists understand\n\u2018compatibilism\u2019 and \u2018incompatibilism\u2019 as\nclaims about moral responsibility (or \u201cmoral freedom\u201d or\nthe freedom that \u201cgrounds\u201d or \u201cexplains\u201d \u201cmoral\nresponsibility\u201d) rather than claims about free will (Pereboom\n1995, 2001, 2014. See Vihvelin 2011 for discussion). This entry will\nnot follow that usage.\n\nThis encyclopedia entry is about the free will/determinism problem;\nmore specifically, it is about arguments for the claim that free will\nis incompatible with determinism. Since so much of the contemporary\nfree will literature is dominated by concerns about moral\nresponsibility, some of the arguments considered will be arguments for\nthe thesis that if determinism is true, we are never morally\nresponsible because we never satisfy the \u201cfreedom\nrequirement\u201d for being morally responsible for our actions. But\nthe focus, in this entry, will be on the question of whether free will\n(or acting with free will) is compatible with determinism.\n",
