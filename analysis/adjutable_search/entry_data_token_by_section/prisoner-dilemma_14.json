    "main_text": "Iteration With Error\n15. Iteration With Error\n\nIn a survey of the field several years after the publication of the\nresults reported above, Axelrod and Dion, chronicle several successes\nof TFT and modifications of it. They conclude that\n\u201cresearch has shown that many of Axelrod's findings\u2026can\nbe generalized to settings that are quite different from the original\ntwo-player iterated prisoner's dilemma game.\u201d But in several\nreasonable settings TFT has serious drawbacks. One\nsuch case, noted in the Axelrod and Dion survey, is when attempts are\nmade to incorporate the plausible assumption that players are subject\nto errors of execution and perception. There are a number of ways this\ncan be done. Bendor, for example, considers \u201cnoisy\npayoffs.\u201d When a player cooperates while its opponent defects,\nits payoff is \\(S+e\\), where \\(e\\) is a random variable whose expected\nvalue is \\(0\\). Each player infers the other's move from its own\npayoff, and so if \\(e\\) is sufficiently high its inference may be\nmistaken. Sugden (pp. 112\u2013115) considers players who have a\ncertain probability of making an error of execution that is apparent\nto them but not their opponents. Such players can adopt strategies by\nwhich they \u201catone\u201d for mistaken defections by being more\ncooperative on later rounds than they would be after intended\ndefection. Assuming that players themselves cannot distinguish a\nmistaken move or observation from a real one, however, the simplest\nway to model the inevitability of error is simply to forbid completely\ndeterministic strategies like TFT, replacing them\nwith \u201cimperfect\u201d counterparts, like \u201cimitate the\nother player's last move with 99% probability and oppose it with 1%\nprobability.\u201d Imperfect TFT is much less\nattractive than its deterministic sibling, because when two\nimperfect TFT strategies play each other, an\n\u201cerror\u201d by either one will set off a long chain of moves\nin which the players take turns defecting. In a long iterated game\nbetween two imperfect TFT's with any probability\n\\(p\\) of error, \\(0 \\lt p \\lt \\tfrac{1}{2}\\), players will approach\nthe same average payoffs as in a game between two strategies that\nchoose randomly between cooperation and defection, namely\n\\(\\tfrac{1}{4}(R+P+S+T)\\). That is considerably worse than the payoff\nof \\(R\\), that results when \\(p=0\\).\n\nThe predominant view seems to be that, when imperfection is\ninevitable, successful strategies will have to be more forgiving of\ndefections by their opponents (since those defections might well be\nunintended). Molander 1985 demonstrates that strategies that mix\nTFT with \\(\\bCu\\) do approach a payoff of \\(R\\) as\nthe probability of error approaches zero. When these mixes play each\nother, they benefit from higher ratios of \\(\\bCu\\) to\nTFT, but if they become too generous, they risk\nexploitation by \u201cstingy\u201d strategies that mix\nTFT with defection. Molander calculates that when the\nmix is set so that, following a defection, one cooperates with\nprobability \\(g(R, P, T, S) = \\min\\{1-(T-R)/(R-S), (R-P)/(T-P)\\}\\),\nthe generous strategies will get the highest score with each other\nthat is possible without allowing stingy strategies to do better\nagainst them than TFT does. Following Nowak and\nSigmund, we label this strategy generous TFT, or\nGTFT. When payoffs have the common values 5,3,1,0 (as\nin Axelrod 1984), GTFT cooperates after every\ninstance of an opponent's cooperation and after 25% of an opponent's\ndefections.\n\nThe idea that the presence of imperfection induces greater forgiveness\nor generosity is only plausible for low levels of imperfection. As the\nlevel of imperfection approaches \\(\\tfrac{1}{2}\\), Imperfect\nTFT becomes indistinguishable from the random strategy, for\nwhich the very ungenerous \\(\\bDu\\) is the best reply. A simulation by\nKollock seems to confirm that at high levels of imperfection, more\nstinginess is better policy than more forgiveness. But Bendor, Kramer\nand Swistak note that the strategies employed in the Kollock\nsimulation are not representative and so the results must be\ninterpreted with caution.\n\nA second idea is that an imperfect environment encourages strategies\nto observe their opponent's play more carefully. In a tournament\nsimilar to Axelrod's (Donninger) in which each player's moves were\nsubject to a 10% chance of alteration, TFT finished\nsixth out twenty-one strategies. As might have predicted on the\ndominant view, it was beaten by the more generous\nTit-for-Two-Tats, aka TFTT (which\ncooperates unless defected against twice in a row). It was also\nbeaten, however, by two versions of Downing, a\nprogram that bases each new move on its best estimate how responsive\nits opponent has been to its previous moves. In Axelrod's two original\ntournaments, Downing had ranked near the bottom third\nof the programs submitted. Bendor (1987) demonstrates deductively that\nagainst imperfect strategies there are advantages to basing one's\nprobability of defection on longer histories than does\nTFT.\n\nOne clever implementation of the idea that a strategies in an\nimperfect environment should pay attention to their previous\ninteractions is the family of \u201cPavlovian\u201d strategies\ninvestigated by Kraines and Kraines. For each natural number \\(n\\),\n\\(n\\)-Pavlov, or \\(\\bP_n\\), adjusts its probability of cooperation in\nunits of \\(\\tfrac{1}{n}\\), according to how well it fared on the\nprevious round. More precisely, if \\(\\bP_n\\) was cooperating with\nprobability \\(p\\) on the last round, then on this round it will\ncooperate with probability \\(p\\,[+]\\tfrac{1}{n}\\) if it received the\nreward payoff on the previous round, \\(p\\,[-]\\tfrac{1}{n}\\) if it\nreceived the punishment payoff, \\(p\\,[+]\\tfrac{2}{n}\\) if it received\nthe temptation payoff, and \\(p\\,[-]\\tfrac{2}{n}\\) if it received the\nsucker payoff. \\([+]\\) and \\([-]\\) are bounded addition and\nsubtraction, i.e., \\(x\\,[+]\\,y\\) is the sum \\(x+y\\) unless that number\nexceeds one, in which case it is one (or as close to one as the\npossibility of error allows), and \\(x\\,[-]\\,y\\) is similarly either\n\\(x-y\\) or close to zero. Strictly speaking, \\(\\bP_n\\) is not fully\nspecified until an initial probability of cooperation is given, but\nfor most purposes the value of that parameter becomes insignificant in\nsufficiently long games and can be safely ignored. It may appear that\n\\(\\bP_n\\) requires far more computational resources to implement than,\nsay, TFT. Each move for the latter depends on only on\nits opponent's last move, whereas each move for \\(\\bP_n\\) is a\nfunction of the entire history of previous moves of both players.\n\\(\\bP_n\\), however, can always calculate its next move by tracking\nonly its current probability of cooperation and its last payoff. As\nits authors maintain, this seems like \u201ca natural strategy in the\nanimal world.\u201d One can calculate that for \\(n \\gt1\\), \\(\\bP_n\\)\ndoes better against the random strategy than does\nTFT. More generally, \\(\\bP_n\\) does as well or better\nthan TFT against the generous unresponsive strategies\nCp that always cooperate with fixed probability \\(p\n\\ge \\tfrac{1}{2}\\) (because an occasional temptation payoff can teach\nit to exploit the unresponsive strategies.) In these cases the\n\u201cslow learner\u201d versions of Pavlov with higher values of\n\\(n\\) do slightly better than the \u201cfast learners\u201d with low\nvalues. Against responsive strategies, like other Pavlovian strategies\nand TFT, \\(\\bP_n\\) and its opponent eventually reach\na state of (almost) constant cooperation. The total payoff is then\ninversely related to the \u201ctraining time,\u201d i.e., the number\nof rounds required to reach that state. Since training time of\n\\(\\bP_n\\) varies exponentially with \\(n\\), Kraines and Kraines\nmaintain that \\(\\bP_3\\) or \\(\\bP_4\\) are to be preferred to other\nPavlovian strategies, and are close to \u201cideal\u201d IPD\nstrategies. It should be noted, however, that when (deterministic)\nTFT plays itself, no training time at all is\nrequired, whereas when a Pavlovian strategy plays TFT\nor another Pavlov, the training time can be large. Thus the cogency of\nthe argument for the superiority of Pavlov over\nTFT depends on the observation that its performance\nshows less degradation when subject to imperfections. It is also worth\nremembering that no strategy is best in every environment, and the\ncriteria used in defense of various strategies in the IPD are vague\nand heterogeneous. One advantage of the evolutionary versions of the\nIPD discussed in the next section is that they permit more careful\nformulation and evaluation of success criteria.\n",
