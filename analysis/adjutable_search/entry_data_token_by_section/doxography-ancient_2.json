    "main_text": "Objections to Diels\u2019 theory: the Aristotelian background\n3. Objections to Diels\u2019 theory: the Aristotelian background\n\nUsener\u2019s influence is also the cause of a fatal blind spot in\nDiels. He failed to acknowledge that Theophrastus, too, had a sort of\nDoktorvater, namely Aristotle. Aristotle, in his treatises,\nas a rule lists and discusses the opinions (doxai) of men in\ngeneral and of the experts (who often are philosophers) in particular,\nconcerning an issue in metaphysics, or physics, or psychology, and\nsometimes ethics, before embarking on his own investigations. These\nopinions are ordered according to the method of diaeresis, or\ndivision: a classification according to sets, sub-sets and\nsub-sub-sets with specific differences. Aristotle checks to what\nextent these opinions are in agreement among themselves or contradict\neach other, and then tries to establish to what extent one of the\navailable options may prove acceptable, at least as the starting-point\nfor further inquiry, or whether some option may be available which\nothers have failed to consider. We call these exegetical and\nevaluative overviews \u2018dialectical\u2019, in the Aristotelian\nsense of the word of course. An overview of this nature should\nestablish which genus, or set, is at issue, that is to say\nwhether we are faced with a theoretical discipline, such as physics\n(and then with what species, or sub-set, e.g., zoology), or\nwith a non-theoretical discipline such as poetics. This approach\nshould also be applied to the sub-sets, or particular objects of\ninquiry, embraced by a particular sub-set. According to Posterior\nAnalytics 2.1 various aspects should (or may) be treated\nseparately, viz.: (1) does the object of the inquiry possess a\nparticular property or attribute, or not; (2) the reason why it does\npossess this attribute; (3) the existence or non-existence of the\nobject (for instance: do gods exist?\u2014a question one does not\nneed to ask when humans, or the sun, are at issue); and (4), the\nsubstance or definition of the object. Here an important part is\nplayed by the Aristotelian so-called categories and other kinds of\npredicates, because it is of major importance to establish to what\ncategory (viz. substance, or quality, or quantity, or place, or doing\nand being-affected etc.) a given object of inquiry and/or its\nattributes belong, or whether and in what sense for instance motion\n(or rest) may be predicated of it. These four different primary\nquestions, or types of questions, may moreover be formulated in\nrespect of each category (viz., not only of substance, but also of\nquality, etc.). Take the objects of mathematics. According to\nAristotle these do not belong to the category of substance but to that\nof quantity. But within this latter category one may formulate\nquestions about properties, or attributes, which may belong to them;\nenquire whether they exist, and if so, in what way; ask whether they\nmove or not; and so on.\n\nIn his treatise on dialectic and its methods, the Topics\n(1.14), Aristotle provides instructions on how to select and classify\npropositions (protaseis) and problems\n(probl\u00eamata):\n\n\nWe should also make selections from the literature and include these\nin separate lists for each set, with separate headings, for instance\n\u2018On the Good\u2019, or \u2018On the Living\nBeing\u2019\u2014that is to say the Good as a whole, starting with\n(the question) \u2018what is it?\u2019 One should cite the\ndoxai [opinions, tenets] of individual thinkers, e.g., that\nEmpedocles said that the elements of bodies are four in number\n[\u2026].\n\nOf propositions and problems there are\u2014to comprehend the matter\nin outline\u2014three sets: some are ethical, others physical, others\nagain logical. Ethical: for instance (the problem) whether one should\nobey one\u2019s parents or the law, when these disagree with each\nother. Logical: for instance (the problem) whether the knowledge of\nopposites is the same, or not. Physical: for instance (the problem)\nwhether the cosmos is eternal or not.\n\n\nConsequently, propositions and problems can be, and therefore in some\ncases should be, elucidated by means of tenets, or opinions:\ndoxai. As there are three sets of propositions, so there are\nthree sets of doxai: physical, ethical, and\n\u2018logical\u2019 (i.e., general). An example of such a diaeresis,\nor division, of a sub-set which is of fundamental importance for\nAristotle is found at the beginning of his Physics. This\ndivision pertains to two categories and one predicate of a different\nsort: the number (category of quantity), nature (category of\nsubstance) and motion vs. rest (category of doing and being-affected)\nof the principles (archai) and elements (stoicheia)\nposited by Aristotle\u2019s predecessors in the field of natural\nphilosophy. In line with the rule formulated in the Topics\nnames of philosophers are added to some of the doxai.\nNumerous other examples of this ingredient of the dialectical method\nare to be found in Aristotle\u2019s writings.\n\nThe above-cited passage from the Topics, and\nAristotle\u2019s general practice, help to determine and explain the\ntitle of the Theophrastean treatise Diels believed to be foundational:\nit should be Physikai Doxai, i.e., \u2018Tenets in [the\nvarious fields of] Natural Philosophy\u2019. And one of the rare\nextant fragments of this treatise not only proves (because of the\nformulation in Greek of the title as quoted) that this title really is\n\u2018Physical Tenets\u2019, but also demonstrates that such tenets\nwere criticized according to the rules of dialectic. Theophrastus, we\nare informed, cited a tenet of Plato\u2019s and then formulated\n\u2018the objections\u2019 against it. The Greek word for\n\u2018objections\u2019 found in this fragment, enstaseis,\nis a technical term in Aristotle\u2019s Topics. Physical\ntenets are tenets, or theses, in the fields of natural philosophy in\nthe largest sense, ranging from the principles, via cosmology,\nastronomy and meteorology etc., to human psychology (including\nphilosophy of mind), biology, and even nosology or the theory of\ndiseases. Physical tenets are not only formulated by\nphysikoi, natural philosophers, but also by physicians and\nastronomers. A\u00ebtius indeed contains a number of\n medical[4]\n and astronomical doxai, the oldest of which may derive from\nsources that can perhaps be attributed to some of Aristotle\u2019s\ncollaborators.
