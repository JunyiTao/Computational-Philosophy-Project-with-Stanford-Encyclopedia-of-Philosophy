Some abilities are so\nwidespread that many who have them take them for granted, such as the\nability to walk, or to write one\u2019s name, or to tell a hawk from a\nhandsaw. Others are comparatively rare and notable, such as the\nability to hit a Major League fastball, or to compose a symphony, or\nto tell an elm from a beech. In either case, however, when we ascribe\nsuch abilities to one another we have the impression that we are\nmaking claims that, whether they are worth saying or not, are at least\nsometimes true. The impression of truth exerts a pressure towards\ngiving a philosophical theory of ability. It is not an option, at\nleast at the outset, to dismiss all our talk of ability as fiction or\noutright falsehood. A theory of ability can be reasonably expected to\nsay what it is to have an ability in a way that vindicates the\nappearance of truth. Such a theory will deserve the name\n\u2018philosophical\u2019 insofar as it gives an account, not of\nthis or that range of abilities, but of abilities generally.\n\nThis article falls into three parts. The first part, Sections 1 and 2,\nstates a framework for discussing philosophical theories of ability.\nSection 1 will say more about the distinction between abilities and\nother powers of agents and objects. Section 2 will make some formal\ndistinctions that are helpful for framing any theory of ability. The\nsecond part, Sections 3\u20135, surveys theories of ability that have\nbeen defended in the philosophical literature. Section\u00a03 concerns\nthe most prominent kind of theory, on which abilities are to be\nunderstood in terms of a hypothetical relating an agent\u2019s actions\nto her volitions. Section 4 concerns theories that are not\nhypothetical in this way, but that nonetheless retain the basic\nreductive orientation of hypothetical theories. Section 5 then\ndiscusses various alternative theories of ability that have been\nproposed in the recent literature. The third part, Section 6, turns to\nthe relationship between a theory of ability and the free will\ndebates. Such debates often involve claims about agents\u2019\nabilities, and many have hoped that getting clearer on abilities\nthemselves could resolve, or at least shed light on, such debates. The\naim of this last section will be to assess whether these hopes are\nreasonable ones.\n", "toc": [{"#Tax": "1.

A taxonomy\n\nWhat is an ability? On one reading, this question is a demand\nfor a theory of ability of the sort described above. On\nanother reading, however, this question simply asks for a rough guide\nto what sort of things we are speaking of when we speak of\n\u2018abilities\u2019. So understood, this question is not asking\nfor a theory of ability, but for an explanation of what exactly a\ntheory of ability would be a theory of. This section will\noffer an answer to this question on this second, more modest,\nreading.\n1.1 Dispositions and other powers\n\nIt will be helpful to begin by considering a topic that is related to,\nbut nominally distinct from, abilities: dispositions.\n\nDispositions are, at first pass, those properties picked out by\npredicates like \u2018is fragile\u2019 or \u2018is soluble\u2019,\nor alternatively by sentences of the form \u2018x is\ndisposed to break when struck\u2019 or \u2018x is disposed\nto dissolve when placed in water.\u2019\u00a0Dispositions so\nunderstood have figured centrally in the metaphysics and philosophy of\nscience of the last century (Carnap 1936 & 1937, Goodman 1954),\nand also in influential accounts of the mind (Ryle 1949). They are\nlike abilities in many significant respects, in particular in the fact\nthat they are properties of things that can exist even when not\nmanifested: as a glass may be fragile even when it is not broken, so\nmay a person have the ability to raise her arm even when she is not\nraising her arm.\n\nWhile dispositions have been central to contemporary philosophical\ndiscussions, they do not exhaust the range of the possibilities\ninherent in things. Especially notable, for present purposes, are\nthose that are intimately connected to agency. These include the\nsusceptibility of things to be acted on in certain ways \u2014 such\nas the edibility of an apple, or the walkability of a trail \u2014\nthat the psychologist J.J. Gibson called affordances (Gibson, 1979).\nThese include also the powers of action that we ascribe to things, of\nthe kind observed by Thomas Reid: \u2018Thus we say, the wind blows,\nthe sea rages, the sun rises and sets, bodies gravitate and\nmove\u2019 (Reid 1788/2010, 16; Reid himself regarded these locutions\nas \"misapplications\" of active verbs, based on erroneous\nviews of the grounds of powers). Finally, and crucially, these include\nthe powers of agents themselves.\n\nIn light of this ontological diversity, it will be useful to have a\nterm that encompasses all the possibilities inherent in things and in\nagents. Let us reserve the word \u2018power\u2019 for that general\nclass. Dispositions, as defined above, are a proper subset of powers\nmore generally. Affordances, as sketched above, are another one. And\nabilities, in a sense still to be defined, are yet another.\n\nIt may yet be that dispositions are especially privileged among the\npowers. For instance, they might be more fundamental than the other\npowers, in the sense that other powers may be reduced to them. It has\nbeen proposed, for instance, that affordances may be reduced to\ndispositions (Scarantino 2003). And we will consider in some detail,\nin Section 5.1, the proposal that abilities themselves may be reduced\nto dispositions. But our initial hypothesis is that dispositions are\nsimply one member of the broader family of powers, albeit one that has\nreceived a great measure of attention in the philosophical\nliterature.\n1.2 Demarcating abilities\n\nAbilities, then, are a kind of power. What kind of power, precisely,\nis an ability? As the term will be understood here, there are two\nadditional conditions that a power must meet in order for it to be an\nability. First, abilities are distinguished by their subjects.\nAbilities are properties of agents, rather than of things that are not\nagents. Objects have dispositions and affordances \u2014 as a glass\nis disposed to break when struck, or affords the drinking of liquid\n\u2014 but they do not have abilities. Being a power of an agent is\nnot, however, a sufficient condition for being an ability. This is\nbecause agents have powers that are not abilities. Therefore, second,\nabilities need to be distinguished by their objects: abilities relate\nagents to actions.\n\nSome examples may make the need for this second condition clear. Some\npowers, though properties of agents, do not intuitively involve any\nrelation to action. Consider the power of understanding language.\nUnderstanding a sentence, while it is not wholly passive or arational,\nis not typically an action. In contrast, speaking a sentence is. Thus\nthe power to understand French will not be an ability, on the present\ntaxonomy. In contrast the power to speak French will be an ability,\nsince it involves a relation to action. (See van Inwagen 1983,\n8\u201313.)\n\nSo, as the term will be understood here, an ability is a power that\nrelates an agent to an action. This way of demarcating abilities,\nwhile serviceable for our purposes, is not unproblematic. For it\ninherits the problems involved in drawing the distinction between\nactions and non-actions. First, there is the problem that the domain\nof action is itself a contentious matter. Second, there is the problem\nthat, even if we have settled on an account of action, it is plausible\nthat the domain of action will be vague, so that there are\nsome events that are not definitely actions, but that are not\ndefinitely not actions either. Arguably both of these points about\naction apply, also, to the property of being an agent. If this is\nright, then the present account of ability, which is cashed out in\nterms of agency and action, will be correspondingly contentious and\nvague. Borderline cases may, in the end, generate problems for the\ntheory of ability. But such problems will not be central here. For\ngiving such a theory will be difficult enough even when we focus on\nparadigm cases of agency and action, and so on paradigm cases of\nability.\n\nNote there is a similarity between the present category of ability, as\ndistinct from other powers, and the traditional category of active\npowers, where active powers are those that essentially involve the\nwill (Reid 1788/2000). But it is not clear that these distinctions\noverlap exactly. For example, the power to will itself will clearly be\nan active power. It is less clear whether it will count as an ability,\nfor the answer to that question will turn on the contentious question\nof whether willing is itself an action.\n1.3 \u2018Know how\u2019 and the intelligent powers\n\nSome will expect that an account of ability would also be an account\nof what it is to know how to perform an action, on the\nsupposition that one knows how to perform a certain action just in\ncase one has the ability to perform that action. This supposition,\nwhich we may call the Rylean account of know how (since it is\nmost explicitly defended in Ryle 1949, 25\u201361), has been called\ninto question by Jason Stanley and Timothy Williamson (Stanley and\nWilliamson 2001). Let us briefly consider Stanley and Williamson\u2019s\nargument and how it bears on the theory of ability.\n\nStanley and Williamson argue, on broadly linguistic grounds, that our\ndefault view of know how ought to be rather different from Ryle\u2019s.\nPart of the argument for this is that standard treatments of embedded\nquestions (\u2018know who\u2019, \u2018know where\u2019, and so\nforth; see Karttunen 1977) suggest a rather different treatment. On\nthis treatment, to know how to A is to know a certain\nproposition. At first pass, in Stanley and Williamson\u2019s\npresentation, for S to know how to A is for\nS to know, of some contextually relevant way of acting\nw, that w is a way for S to A.\nStanley and Williamson develop and defend such a treatment, and offer\nindependent considerations for rejecting Ryle\u2019s own arguments for\nthe Rylean view. On their view, then, to know how to A is\nnot to have an ability.\n\nStanley and Williamson\u2019s arguments are far from widely accepted\n(see No\u00eb 2005), but they tell at the very least against simply\nassuming that an account of ability will also be an account\nof know how. So we will leave questions of know how to one side in\nwhat follows. It is also reasonable to hope that an account of\nability, while it may not simply be an account of know how,\nwill at least shed light on disputes about know how. For so long as we\nlack a theory of what an ability is, the precise content of the Rylean\nview (and of its denial) remains unclear. So it may be that getting\nclear on abilities may help us, perhaps indirectly, to get clear on\nknow how as well. (Additional discussion of these questions may be\nfound in Stanley\u2019s book-length development of his and\nWilliamson\u2019s initial position (Stanley 2011), as well as the\npapers collected in (Bengson and Moffett 2011).\n\nWhatever our view of ability and know how, there is a further question\nat the intersection of these topics that bears consideration. This is\nhow to accommodate those powers of agents that appear to be especially\nclosely connected to practical intelligence, such as skills and\ntalents \u2014 which we might collectively call the intelligent\npowers. Are the intelligent powers simply a species of ability,\nor do they demand an independent treatment? There are a number of\nrecent proposals to be considered here. (Robb forthcoming) proposes a\ndispositionalist theory of talent, on which a talent is a disposition\nto maintain and develop a skill. (McGeer 2018) emphasizes the\nsignificance of a distinctive kind of intelligent power, which she\n(following Ryle) calls an \u2018intelligent capacity,\u2019 and of\nwhich she too offers a broadly dispositionalist account. These\nproposals suggest a more general program of dispositionalism about the\nintelligent powers, which has suggestive parallels to the\ndispositionalism about ability that we will consider in Section 5.1.\nStill more generally, accurately accounting for the nature of the\nintelligent powers, and the relationship of these to abilities and to\nthe powers more generally, remains an open and intriguing problem.\n2. Two fundamental distinctions\n\nIf one wants to give a theory of ability of the sort described at the\noutset, it is helpful for that theory to observe some formal\ndistinctions that have been marked in the literature. This section\ncanvasses two of the most important formal\u00a0distinctions.\n2.1 General and specific ability\n\nThe previous section was primarily concerned with distinguishing\nabilities from other powers. But there is also a distinction to be\nmade within the class of abilities itself. This is the distinction\nbetween general and specific abilities\n(Honor\u00e9 1964, Mele 2002).\n\nThe distinction between general and specific abilities may be brought\nout by way of example. Consider a well-trained tennis player equipped\nwith ball and racquet, standing at the service line. There is, as it\nwere, nothing standing between her and a serve: every prerequisite for\nher serving has been met. Such an agent is in a position to\nserve, or has serving as an option. Let us say that such an\nagent has the specific ability to serve.\n\nIn contrast, consider an otherwise similar tennis player who lacks a\nracquet and ball, and is miles away from a tennis court. There is\nclearly a good sense in which such an agent has the ability to hit a\nserve: she has been trained to do so, and has done so many times in\nthe past. Yet such an agent lacks the specific ability to\nserve, as that term was just defined. Let us say that such an agent\nhas the general ability to serve.\n\nThe concern of this article will be general abilities in this sense,\nand unqualified references to \u2018ability\u2019 should be read in\nthat way. But specific abilities will also be at issue. This is for at\nleast two reasons.\n\nThe first is one of coverage: many of the proposals that are relevant\nto the understanding of ability, especially the classical\n\u2018conditional analysis\u2019 (discussed in Section 3.1 below),\nare naturally read as proposals about specific ability in the present\nsense, and a suitably broad conception of ability lets us keep these\nproposals within our domain of discussion.\n\nThe second reason is more properly philosophical. If we accept the\ndistinction between general and specific abilities, then we want for\nour account of ability to accommodate both of them, and ultimately to\nexplain how they are related to each other. For this distinction is\nnot plausibly diagnosed as mere ambiguity; it rather marks off\nsomething like two modes of a single kind of power. There are at least\ntwo kinds of proposals one may make here. One, arguably implicit in\nmany of the \u2018new dispositionalist\u2019 approaches to ability,\nis that general ability is in some sense prior to specific ability: to\nhave a specific ability is simply to have a general ability and to\nmeet some further constraint, such as having an opportunity. Another\nproposal (suggested in Maier 2015) is that specific ability is in some\nsense prior to general ability: to have a general ability is simply to\nhave a specific ability under a certain range of circumstances.\n\nThe idea that there is some sort of bipartite distinction to be made\nbetween abilities has been a prominent theme in contemporary work on\nability. It has been endorsed and developed, in different contexts, by\nGlick (2012), Vihvelin (2013), and Whittle (2010). It is an open\nquestion whether the bipartite distinctions in ability introduced by\nthese authors are the same as one another, or the same as the one\nintroduced here. It could be that there are several bipartite\ndistinctions to be made in this area, or that we simply have one\ndistinction under several names.\n2.2 Abilities and ability-ascriptions\n\nMuch philosophical discussion of ability has taken place in the\nformal, as opposed to the material, mode. Thus we are often asked to\ndistinguish senses of \u2018ability\u2019, or to think\nabout what \u2018can\u2019 means. This subtle shift between\ndiscussing ability and discussing the ascription of ability is often\nharmless. Nonetheless, it is important to bear in mind the distinction\nbetween these questions, and to mark this distinction explicitly at\nthe outset.\n\nOn the one hand, there are questions about ability itself. The central\nquestion here to give an account of what an ability is, in the sense\nforegrounded at the outset. Subsidiary questions here include, for\nexample, whether abilities may exist when they are unexercised,\nwhether abilities are intrinsic or extrinsic features of their\nbearers, and whether agents have abilities in deterministic worlds.\nThese are, broadly speaking, questions about the metaphysics of\nability.\n\nOn the other hand, there are questions about ability-ascriptions.\nAbilities are characteristically ascribed (in English) with sentences\ninvolving the modal auxiliaries \u2018can\u2019 and \u2018is able\nto.\u2019 Accordingly, the central question here is to give a\nsemantics for sentences involving those expressions. Subsidiary tasks\ninclude resolving certain open problems in the semantics of these\nexpressions, such as the \u2018actuality entailment\u2019 observed\nin (Bhatt 1999), and integrating a semantics for agentive modals with\na semantics for modal expressions more generally. These are, broadly\nspeaking, questions about the semantics of agentive modality.\n\nOn certain conceptions of the philosophical enterprise, the project of\ngiving a theory of ability and that of giving a semantics for\nability-ascriptions are closely connected, and even collapse into each\nother. Nonetheless, there is at least a methodological distinction to\nbe marked here. Having marked that distinction, this discussion will\nprimarily be concerned with the first of these projects, the project\nof giving a theory of ability. Nonetheless, the project of giving a\nsemantics for ability-ascriptions will also frequently be relevant. As\nwith the distinction between general and specific abilities, this is\nfor two reasons, one of coverage and one more properly\nphilosophical.\n\nThe first reason, that of coverage, is the following. Many of the most\nprominent theories of ability defended in the philosophical literature\nhave in fact been, in the first place, theories of\nability-ascriptions. Indeed, the central thought in much work on\nability in the analytic tradition has been a kind of semantic\ndeflationism, on which we may give a semantics for ability-ascriptions\nthat does not quantify over abilities themselves. This is arguably the\nmain theme of the hypothetical theories to be considered in Section 3,\nand the modal theories to be considered in Section 4. Given this\ntendency in thinking about ability, an overview of philosophical work\non ability that neglected the role of ability-ascriptions would be\nseriously incomplete.\n\nThere is also the second, more philosophical, reason. Any account of\nabilities owes us, among other things, an account of\nability-ascriptions. This is perhaps true of philosophical topics\ngenerally, but it is true of ability in particular. Even philosophers\nwho are explicit in their \u2018refusal to take language as a\nstarting point in the analysis of thought and modality\u2019 (Lewis\n1986, xi) are prone to make explicit appeal to language when the topic\nturns to ability, as occurs in (Lewis 1976) or (Taylor 1960). This is\nfor any number of reasons, but perhaps especially because it is\ndifficult to even identify the topic under consideration without using\nor mentioning certain phrases, notably \u2018can\u2019 and \u2018is\nable to.\u2019\n\nHappily, the topic of ability-ascriptions is one on which linguists\nand philosophers have made significant progress. While there has long\nbeen considerable philosophical interest expressions such as\n\u2018can\u2019 and \u2018is able to,\u2019\u00a0there is nothing\nrecognizable as a rigorous semantic theory of such terms prior to the\nfoundational work of Angelika Kratzer, recently revised and collected\nin (Kratzer 2012). Kratzer\u2019s work has been central to natural\nlanguage semantics, and its significance for philosophical work is\nstill being appreciated. The question of whether it is correct as an\naccount of the semantics of agentive modality is an open one:\nimportant challenges include (Hackl 1998) and, more recently,\n(Mandelkern, Schultheis, and Boylan, 2017), (Schwarz 2020), and\n(Willer forthcoming). The Kratzer semantics, and a view of ability on\nwhich that semantics plays a foundational role, will be considered in\nsome detail in Section 4. The more methodological point being made\nhere is that any adequate account of ability ought to provide an\naccount of ability-ascriptions, and as such may want to reckon with\nthis ongoing debate in the semantics of modal expressions.\n3. Hypothetical theories of ability\n\nThe bulk of theories of ability that have been defended in the\nhistorical and contemporary literature have been what we might call\nhypothetical theories. On such views, to have an ability is\nfor it to be the case that one would act in certain ways if\none were to have certain volitions. One arrives at different theories\ndepending on how one understands the volitions in question and how\nexactly these actions would hypothetically depend on them, but\nnonetheless these views constitute something like a unified family.\nGiven their prominence and unity, it is natural to begin our survey of\ntheories of ability with them.\n3.1 The conditional analysis\n\nThe most prominent hypothetical theory of ability is what has come to\nbe called the \u2018conditional analysis\u2019. In this section, we\nwill survey that form of analysis, the problems for it, and\nalternatives to it that are supposed to overcome those problems.\n\nThe conditional analysis of ability has at least two aspects. First,\nS has an ability to A just in case a certain\nconditional is true of her. Second, that conditional has the following\nform: S would A if S were to have a certain\nvolition. The precise form such an analysis will take will depend on,\nfirst, how we interpret this conditional and, second, which volition\nfigures in the antecedent.\n\nIt has been standard in the literature, when this first question has\nbeen raised, to understand the conditional as a subjunctive\nconditional (Ginet 1980), and we will assume in what follows that this\nis the best form of the conditional analysis. There has been some\ndisagreement about whether it is a might or a would\nconditional that is relevant (for an account of this distinction, see\nLewis 1973, 21\u201324), as well as about which volition is relevant.\nIn the following, we will take the relevant conditional to be a\nwould conditional, and the relevant volition to be\ntrying, though nothing will hang on these selections, and the\npoints to be raised would apply also to other forms of conditional\nanalysis, mutatis mutandis.\n\nWe thus arrive at the following form of the conditional analysis:\n\n(CA)\nS has the ability to A iff S would\nA if S tried to A.\n\n\nIf (CA) were true, it would constitute a theory of ability in that it\nwould say under exactly what conditions some agent has the ability to\nperform some action without making reference to the idea of ability\nitself. (Note that a variant on (CA) that is sometimes discussed,\naccording to which S has the ability to A iff\nS could A if S tried to\nA, would not meet this standard, since the\n\u2018could\u2019 seems to make a claim about S\u2019s\nabilities. So such a view is not really a conditional\nanalysis. Indeed, it is not even clear that it involves a\ngenuine conditional, for reasons discussed in Austin 1970\n(211\u2013213).\n\nThe conditional analysis so understood has been subject to a fair\namount of criticism, which will be reviewed in the following section.\nIt bears noting, however, just how apt an account of ability it seems\nat first pass. It satisfies, at least at first approximation, the\nextensional constraints: there are many actions with respect to which\na typical agent satisfies the relevant conditional, and also many\nactions with respect to which she does not, and these roughly\ncorrespond to her abilities. This imposes a demand even on those who\nwish to reject (CA), namely to explain why, if (CA) is simply\nfalse, it so closely approximates to the truth about abilities.\n\nIts approximate satisfaction of the extensional constraints is also\nplausibly a reason why something like (CA) has found so many\nthoughtful advocates. It is at least strongly suggested, for example,\nby the following remarks from Hume\u2019s Enquiry:\n\nFor what is meant by liberty, when applied to voluntary actions? We\ncannot surely mean that actions have so little connexion with motives,\ninclinations, and circumstances, that one does not follow with a\ncertain degree of uniformity from the other, and that one affords no\ninference by which we can conclude the existence of the other. For\nthese are plain and acknowledged matters of fact. By liberty, then, we\ncan only mean a power of acting or not acting, according to the\ndeterminations of the will; this is, if we choose to remain at rest,\nwe may; if we choose to move, we also may. Now this hypothetical\nliberty is universally allowed to belong to every one who is not a\nprisoner and in chains. (8.1; Hume 1748, 72)\n\n\nOf course, Hume and many of those who have followed him have been\nattempting to do something rather more than to offer a theory\nof ability. Hume\u2019s intent was to show that disputes over\n\u2018question of liberty and necessity, the most contentious\nquestion of metaphysics\u2019 have been \u2018merely verbal\u2019\n(8.1; Hume 1748, 72). Whatever we may think of this striking claim,\nhowever, there is a dialectical gap between it and the alleged truth\nof (CA). To anticipate a theme that will be central in what follows,\nwe must be careful to distinguish between, on the one hand, the\nadequacy of various views of ability and, on the other, the more\ncontentious metaphysical questions about freedom to which they are\ndoubtlessly related. It is the former that will be our concern in this\nsection.\n3.2 Problems for the conditional analysis\n\n(CA) says that satisfying a certain conditional is both sufficient and\nnecessary for having a certain ability. There are two kinds of\ncounterexamples that may be brought against (CA): counterexamples to\nits sufficiency, and to its necessity. Let us take these in turn.\n\nCounterexamples to the sufficiency of (CA) have been most\nprominent in the literature. Informally, they are suggested by the\nquestion: \u2018but could S try to A?\u2019 There\nare a variety of ways of translating this rhetorical question into a\ncounterexample. We may distinguish two: global\ncounterexamples, according to which (CA) might always get the\nfacts about ability wrong, and local counterexamples,\naccording to which (CA) might sometimes get the facts about\nability wrong.\n\nBegin with global counterexamples. Let us say that\ndeterminism is true at our world. Familiar arguments purport\nto show that, if this is the case, then no one has the ability to do\nanything, except perhaps for what she actually does (for several\ndevelopments of such an argument, see van Inwagen 1983, 55\u2013105).\nBut if (CA) is true, then agents would have the ability to perform\nvarious actions that they do not actually perform. For it is plausible\nthat the conditionals in terms of which (CA) analyzes ability would\nstill be true in a deterministic world. But then, since it makes false\npredictions about such a world, which for all we know may be our own,\n(CA) is false.\n\nThe difficulties involved in this sort of counterexample are clear.\nThe proponent of (CA) will reject the arguments for the\nincompatibility of ability and determinism as unsound. Indeed, it is\nprecisely her thought that such arguments are unsound that has\ntypically led her to take ability to be analyzed in terms like those\nof (CA). So global counterexamples, while they may be successful, are\ndialectically ineffective relative to the range of questions\nthat are at issue in the debates over ability.\n\nIt seems, however, that we can show that (CA) is false even relative\nto premises that are shared between various disputants in the free\nwill debates. This is what is shown by local counterexamples\nto (CA). One such example is given by Keith Lehrer:\n\nSuppose that I am offered a bowl of candy and in the bowl are small\nround red sugar balls. I do not choose to take one of the red sugar\nballs because I have a pathological aversion to such candy. (Perhaps\nthey remind me of drops of blood and \u2026 ) It is logically\nconsistent to suppose that if I had chosen to take the red sugar ball,\nI would have taken one, but, not so choosing, I am utterly unable to\ntouch one. (Lehrer 1968, 32)\n\n\nSuch an example shows that (CA) is false without assuming anything\ncontentious in debates over freedom. It turns rather on a simple\npoint: that psychological shortcomings, just as much as external\nimpediments, may undermine abilities. (CA), which does not recognize\nthis point, is therefore subject to counterexamples where such\npsychological shortcomings become relevant. We may, if we like,\ndistinguish \u2018psychological\u2019 from\n\u2018non-psychological\u2019 ability, and claim that (CA) correctly\naccounts for the latter (this sort of strategy is suggested, for\nexample, by Albritton 1985). But our ordinary notion of ability, that\nof which we are attempting to give a theory, seems to involve\nboth psychological and non-psychological requirements. And if\nthat is correct, then Lehrer\u2019s example succeeds as a\ncounterexample to (CA) as a theory of our ordinary notion of\nability.\n\nCounterexamples to the necessity of (CA) have been less\nfrequently discussed (though see Wolf 1990), but they also raise\nimportant issues about ability. Consider a case where a good golfer\nmisses an easy putt. Given that this golfer tried to make the putt and\nfailed to, it is false that she would have made the putt if she had\ntried to; after all, she did try it and did not make it.\n(This thought is vindicated by standard views of subjunctive\nconditionals; see Bennett 2003, 239). But, as a good golfer, she\npresumably had the ability to make the putt. So this seems to be a\ncase where one can have an ability without satisfying the relevant\nconditional, and hence a counterexample to the necessity of (CA).\n\nHere the defender of (CA) might avail herself of the distinction\nbetween specific and general abilities. (CA), she might say, is an\naccount of what it is to have a specific ability: that is, to actually\nbe in a position to perform an action. The golfer does lack\nthis ability in this case, as (CA) correctly predicts. It is\nnonetheless true that the golfer has the general ability to\nsink putts like this. But (CA) does not purport to be an analysis of\ngeneral ability, and as such is compatible with the golfer having that\nsort of ability. Again, the plausibility of this response will hang on\nthe viability of the distinction between specific and general\nabilities.\n\nWe have seen that (CA) faces serious problems, especially as a\nsufficient condition for ability, even once we set to one\nside contentious claims about freedom and determinism. If this is\ncorrect, then (CA) must either be modified or rejected outright. Let\nus first consider the prospects for modification.\n3.3 The conditional analysis: some variations\n\nThe guiding idea of hypothetical accounts is that abilities are to be\ndefined in terms of what someone would do were he in certain\npsychological conditions. There are a number of ways of developing\nthis idea that do not fit into the form of (CA). At least two such\nproposals deserve attention here.\n\nDonald Davidson takes concerns about the sufficiency of (CA),\nespecially as developed in Chisholm 1964, to tell decisively against\nit. More specifically, he takes the lesson of this problem to be is\nthat:\n\nThe antecedent of a causal conditional that attempts to analyze\n\u2018can\u2019 or \u2018could\u2019 or \u2018free to\u2019 must\nnot contain, as its dominant verb, a verb of action, or any verb\nwhich makes sense of the question, Can someone do it?\n(Davidson 1980, 68)\n\n\nDavidson suggests that we may overcome this difficulty at least by\nendorsing:\n\nA can do x intentionally (under the description\nd) means that if A has desires and beliefs that\nrationalize x (under d), then A does\nx. (Davidson 1980, 68)\n\n\nDavidson proceeds to consider a number of further problems for this\nproposal and for the causal theory of action generally, but he takes\nit to suffice at least to overcome standard objections to the\nsufficiency of (CA).\n\nThe trouble is that it is not at all clear it does so. For these\nobjections did not essentially depend on a verb of action figuring in\nthe antecedent of the analyzing conditional. Consider Lehrer\u2019s\ncase again. It seems true that if Lehrer\u2019s imagined agent\nhas desires and beliefs that rationalized that action under the\ndescription \u2018eating a red candy\u2019\u2014namely, adopting\nthe analysis of Davidson 1963, a desire for a red candy and a belief\nthat this action is a way of eating a red candy\u2014she would eat a\nred candy. But the trouble is precisely that, in virtue of her\npsychological disability, she is incapable of having this desire, and\nso cannot perform this action intentionally. For this reason it does\nnot seem that Davidson\u2019s proposal successfully overcomes the\nsufficiency problem, at least not on Lehrer\u2019s way of developing\nthat problem.\n\nA second and rather different approach to modifying (CA) has been\ntaken in recent work by Christopher Peacocke. Peacocke accepts that\n(CA) is insufficient in light of counterexamples like Lehrer\u2019s.\nBut he argues that we might supplement (CA) in order to\novercome these difficulties. In the terms of the present discussion,\nPeacocke\u2019s proposal is: S has the ability to A\njust in case: (i) (CA) is true of S and (ii) the\npossibility in which S tries to A is a\n\u2018close\u2019 one. The closeness of a possibility as it figures\nin (ii) is to be understood, at first pass, in terms of what we can\nreasonably rely on: a possibility is a distant one just in\ncase we can reasonably rely on it not obtaining; otherwise it is a\nclose one (Peacocke 1999, 310). To modify one of Peacocke\u2019s\nexamples, the possibility of toxic fumes being released into a train\ncar that is safely insulated is a distant one; on the other hand, the\npossibility of toxic fumes being released into a train car where they\njust happen to be blocked by a fortuitous arrangement of luggage is a\nclose one.\n\nPeacocke\u2019s thought is that this suffices to overcome the\nsufficiency objection: though Lehrer\u2019s agent satisfies (i), she\ndoes not satisfy (ii): given the facts about his psychology, the\npossibility that he tries to A is not a close one. The\ntrouble, however, is that Peacocke\u2019s proposal is subject to\nmodified versions of Lehrer\u2019s counterexample. Consider an agent\nwhose aversion to red candies is not a permanent feature of her\npsychology, but an unpredictable and temporary \u2018mood\u2019.\nConsider the agent at some time when she is in her aversive mood. This\nagent satisfies (i), for the same reason as above, and she also\nsatisfies (ii): given the fragility of her mood, the possibility of\nher trying is a close one in the relevant sense. Yet such an agent\nlacks the ability to eat a red candy, in precisely the same way as she\ndoes in Lehrer\u2019s original example.\n\nIt is an interesting question how we might develop other\n\u2018supplementation\u2019 strategies for (CA) (such strategies are\nalso suggested by Ginet 1980), though the track record of this method\nof analysis in other domains (for instance, the project of\n\u2018supplementing\u2019 the analysis of knowledge in terms of\njustified true belief, in response to (Gettier 1963)) does not inspire\nconfidence.\n4. Modal theories of ability\n\nThere is a surprising disconnect between the way abilities have been\ndiscussed in the philosophical literature in the tradition of Hume and\nthe way that they have been approached in more recent work in logic\nand linguistics. Here, ability claims are understood as categorical\npossibility claims: claims about what some agent does in some\nnon-actual state of affairs (or \u2018possible world\u2019). Let a\nmodal theory of ability be any theory on which claims about\nan agent\u2019s abilities are understood in terms of claims about\nwhat that agent in fact does at some possible world (or set of\nworlds). The idea that some such modal theory of ability must be true\nis a presumption of much formal work on ability and\nability-ascriptions. Yet there are serious challenges to the idea that\nability is in this sense a modality.\n4.1 The modal analysis\n\nIntuitively, claims about ability are claims about possibility. It is\nin some sense a truism that someone is able to perform some act just\nin case it is possible for her to perform it.\n\nTo develop this purported truism, begin with the thought that for\nS to have an ability to A it is necessary, but not\nsufficient, that it be possible that S does A. This\nclaim will be contentious for various more specialized sorts of\npossibility, such as nomic possibility. But if we may help\nourselves to the idea of possibility simpliciter\n(\u2018metaphysical possibility,\u2019\u00a0on at least one reading\nof that phrase), then this claim appears plausible. (We will survey\nsome historical and contemporary challenges to it below in Section\n4.2.) On the other hand it seems implausible that this sort of\npossibility is a sufficient condition: there are any number of acts\nthat that are metaphysically possible to perform that an agent might\nnonetheless not be able to perform.\n\nThis suggests a natural hypothesis. To have an ability is for it to be\npossible to A in some restricted sense of\npossibility. As nomic possibility is possibility relative to the laws\nof nature, and epistemic possibility is possibility relative to what\nan agent knows, so may ability be possibility relative to some\nindependently specifiable set of conditions.\n\nTo render this hypothesis precisely, we may help ourselves to the\nformal framework of \u2018possible worlds,\u2019 which offers an\nelegant and powerful semantics for modal language. On this framework,\na proposition is possible just in case it is true at some possible\nworld. We can then say an agent is able to A just in case she performs\nthat act at some world (or set of worlds) that satisfy some\nindependently specifiable set of conditions.\n\nWe thus arrive at the modal analysis of ability:\n\n(MA) S has the ability to A iff S\ndoes A at some world (or set of worlds) satisfying condition\nC.\n\n\n(MA) is actually not itself an analysis but rather a template for a\ngeneral family of analyses. Different members of this family will be\ndistinguished by the different candidates they might propose for C, as\nwell as whether they quantify over individual worlds or sets of\nworlds. Nonetheless, these analyses demonstrate sufficient theoretical\nunity that they may be viewed, at an appropriate level of abstraction,\nas a single approach to the analysis of ability.\n\nTwo points about (MA) bear noting. First, \u2018modal\u2019 here is\nbeing used in a relatively strict and narrow way. Sometimes\n\u2018modal\u2019 is used loosely to describe phenomena that are\nconnected to possibility (and necessity) in some way or other. As\nnoted above, it is a truism that there is some connection between\nability and necessity, and so that ability is in this loose sense\n\u2018modal.\u2019 The proponent of (MA) is concerned with modality\nin a stricter sense: she proposes that ability may be analyzed in\nterms of the precise framework of propositions and possible worlds\njust adumbrated. The opponent of (MA), in turn, grants that ability\nhas something to do with possibility but denies that any such analysis\nsucceeds.\n\nSecond, while (MA) has been presented as an alternative to (CA), (CA)\nis arguably just one particular version of (MA). For, as noted above,\n(CA) appeals to a subjunctive conditional, and the standard semantics\nfor the subjunctive conditional (developed in slightly different ways\nin Stalnaker 1968 and Lewis 1973) is told in terms of quantification\nover possible worlds. Specifically (on Stalnaker\u2019s version) a\nsubjunctive conditional is true just in case its consequent is true at\nthe world where its antecedent is true that is otherwise maximally\nsimilar to the actual world. In these terms, (CA) is roughly\nequivalent to the following:\n\n(CAmodal) S has the ability to A\niff S does A at a world at which S tries\nto A that is otherwise maximally similar to the actual world.\n\n\nThis is patently a version of (MA), with \u2018S tries\nto A and is otherwise maximally similar to the actual\nworld\u2019 serving as condition C.\n\nIf this is correct, then most discussions of the analysis on ability\nin the twentieth century have focused on a special and somewhat\nidiosyncratic case of a much broader program of analysis, namely the\nprogram of giving a modal analysis of ability. The considerations\nbrought forth in the remainder of this section, in contrast, are\nconcerned with the general case.\n4.2 The modal analysis: logical considerations\n\nThere are two questions that might be raised for this proposal about\nability. First, does ability indeed admit of some kind of modal\nanalysis? Second, if it does, how exactly are we to spell out the\ndetails of that analysis \u2014 in particular, how are we to\narticulate condition C? Let us begin with the first, more basic,\nquestion.\n\nAccording to (MA), performing an act at some possible world (or set of\nworlds) is both necessary and sufficient for having the ability to\nperform that act. One way of challenging this claim is to deny the\nnecessity claim: that is, to argue that it is sometimes the case that\nan agent is able to perform an act that she does not perform at any\npossible world.\n\nThis is an argument that has in fact been made by several authors.\nDescartes, for one, appears to have argued that God is such an agent\n(Curley 1984). A genuinely omnipotent being, one might argue, should\nbe able to perform any act whatsoever, even the impossible ones. This\nview of omnipotence is contentious, but it is not clear that it should\nbe ruled out formally, by the very analysis of ability, as (MA) does.\nSpencer (2017) argues that even non-omnipotent agents may sometimes\nhave the ability to perform acts that they do not perform at any\npossible world.\n\nLet us grant, however, that the possibility of performing an act is a\nnecessary condition for performing that act, and that in this sense an\nattribution of ability entails a possibility claim. One might\nnonetheless resist the view that ability admits of a modal analysis in\nthe manner suggested by (MA).\n\nThat is the kind of argument developed in a prescient discussion by\nAnthony Kenny (Kenny 1975; the presentation of Kenny here is indebted\nto the discussion in Brown 1988). Kenny argues that, if something like\n(MA) is indeed true, then ability should obey the principles that\ngovern the possibility operator in standard modal logics. Kenny claims\nthat ability\u00a0fails to satisfy the following two principles:\n\n(1) \\(A \\to \\Diamond A.\\)\n\n\nInformally, (1) expresses the principle that if an agent performs an\naction, then she has the ability to perform this action. This is,\nKenny argues, false of ability.\n\n(2) \\(\\Diamond(A \\lor B) \\to (\\Diamond A \\lor \\Diamond B).\\)\n\n\nInformally, (2) expresses the principle that if an agent has the\nability to perform one of two actions, then she has the ability to\nperform either the first action or the second action. This is, Kenny\nargues, false of ability.\n\nLet us begin with (1). Kenny claims that this principle is false in\nlight of cases like the following: \u2018A hopeless darts player may,\nonce in a lifetime, hit the bull, but be unable to repeat the\nperformance because he does not have the ability to hit the\nbull\u2019 (Kenny 1975, 136). This kind of \u2018fluky\nsuccess\u2019 has been extensively discussed in the philosophical\nliterature \u2014 perhaps most famously in Austin (1956) \u2014 in\norder to make a variety of points. Kenny\u2019s insight is to observe\nthat these simple cases tell against the modal analysis of ability, as\nthey violate an axiom of many modal logics, namely any system as\nstrong as the system T.\n\nA simple response to this point is to deny that T (or\nany stronger logic) is the correct logic for ability. To deny this is\nstill to allow for a treatment of ability within the framework of\npossible worlds. Notably, the modal logic K is one\nthat fails to validate (1). A natural response to Kenny\u2019s first\npoint, then, is to say that K, rather than\nT or some stronger system, is the correct modal logic\nof ability.\n\nThis response is not available, however, in response to Kenny\u2019s\nsecond objection. Recall that objection was that (2) is true of\npossibility but not of ability. Here the retreat to weaker modal\nlogics will not work, since (2) is provable on the weakest standard\nmodal logic, namely K. Yet the parallel claim does\nnot seem true of ability. Kenny gives the following example:\n\nGiven a pack of cards, I have the ability to pick out on request a\ncard which is either black or red; but I don\u2019t have the ability to\npick out a red card on request nor the ability to pick out a black\ncard on request. (Kenny 1975, 137)\n\n\nThis then appears to be a case where S has the ability to\nA or B but lacks the ability to A and lacks\nthe ability to B. So it appears that (2) is false of ability.\nIn light of this Kenny concludes that \u2018if we regard possible\nworlds semantics as making explicit what is involved in being a\npossibility, we must say that ability is not any kind of\npossibility\u2019 (Kenny 1975, 140).\n\nTo appreciate Kenny\u2019s conclusion, it is instructive to work\nthrough why precisely this is a counterexample to (MA). Consider an\nagent S who has the ability to pick a red card or a black\ncard, but does not have the ability to pick a red card or the ability\nto pick a black card. According to (MA), S has the ability\nto A iff S does A at some world (or set of\nworlds) satisfying condition C. Consider the case where (MA)\nappeals to a single world, not a set of worlds. If S has the\nability to pick a red card or pick a black card, then by (MA) there is\na world w satisfying condition C where S\npicks a red card or black card. Then either S picks a red\ncard at w or S picks a black card\nat w. Then, applying (MA) now in the other\ndirection, S has the ability to pick a red card or S\nhas the ability to pick a black card.  But that, by assumption, is not\nthe case. Since (MA) is the only substantive premise appealed to that\nargument, (MA) must be rejected.\n\nNote that this argument turned essentially on adopting the version of\n(MA) which appealed to a single world, rather than a set of worlds. So\none way of responding to this objection is by appealing to sets of\nworlds in the modal analysis of ability. This is precisely the\nproposal of Mark Brown, who argues that, if we take accessibility\nrelations to hold between a world and a set of worlds, then\u00a0we\nmay capture talk of ability within a possible worlds framework that is\nbroadly in the spirit of standard views (Brown 1988; see also Cross\n1986). Alternatively, we may take this sort of point to militate in\nfavor of a return to hypothetical theories of ability, since, at least\non Lewis\u2019s view of subjunctive conditionals, it may be that a\ndisjunction follows from a counterfactual claim without either of its\ndisjuncts following from that claim (Lewis 1973, 79\u201380). Modal\naccounts that appeal to sets of worlds are \u2018non-normal\u2019 in\nthe sense that they do not satisfy the axiom K, but\nthey remain true to the letter of (MA) as well as the spirit of modal\nanalyses generally, insofar as they avail themselves only of possible\nworlds and quantification thereover.\n4.3 The modal analysis: linguistic considerations\n\nIn the material mode, the modal analysis gives an account of what it\nis to have an ability in terms of quantification over possible worlds.\nIn the formal mode, it gives a semantics for the ascription of ability\n\u2014 paradigmatically, sentences involving \u2018can\u2019 or\n\u2018is able to\u2019 \u2014 in terms of quantification over\npossible worlds.\n\nThis formal aspect of the modal analysis has been prominent in the\nphilosophical and linguistic literature because the standard semantics\nfor ability ascriptions is an explicitly modal one. This is the view\ndeveloped in a series of papers by Angelika Kratzer (Kratzer 2012).\nKratzer treats expressions such as \u2018S\ncan A\u2019 and \u2018S is able\nto A\u2019 as possibility claims. That is, \u2018S\nis able to A\u2019 is true just in case there is a possible\nworld w meeting certain conditions at which S\ndoes A. The conditions are that (i) w be accessible\ngiven some contextually-specified set of facts (the\nmodal base) and (ii) that w be at least as good,\naccording to a contextually-specified ranking of worlds\n(the ordering source), as any other accessible world. The\nKratzer semantics is thus an instance of the modal analysis on its\nsemantic formulation:\n\n(MAsemantic) \u2018S is able to A\u2019\nis true iff S does A at some world (or set of\nworlds) satisfying condition C.\n\n\nA number of objection have been brought against the modal analysis in\nthis latter, formal, aspect.\n\nOne objection prominent in the recent literature (Mandelkern et al.\n2017; Schwarz 2020) is that Kratzer\u2019s semantics, or any analysis\nof the form of (MAsemantic), appears to have trouble\nmarking an intuitive distinction between what someone is able to do\nand what it is possible for her to do. Let us say that an unskilled\ndarts-player is about to throw a dart. She utters:\n\n(3) I am able to hit the bullseye\n\n\nIntuitively, what she says is false: she is not able to hit the\nbullseye, as she is a poor darts-player. Yet there is an accessible\nand perfectly good possible world w at which she hits the\nbullseye \u2014 which is just to say, in the object language, that it\nis possible for her to hit the bullseye.\n\nThis case suggests the Kratzer semantics lacks the resources to\ncapture the distinctively agentive force of a sentences such as (3).\nThere are, in addition, a number of other outstanding empirical\nproblems for Kratzer\u2019s semantics for ability modals. One is the\nproblem of accounting for \u2018compulsion\u2019 modals such as\n\u2018I cannot but tell the truth\u2019 (Mandelkern et al. 2017).\nAnother is that of accommodating the \u2018actuality\nentailment\u2019 whereby, in many languages, certain ability\nsentences entail that the act in question was actually performed\n(Bhatt 1999; see also Hacquard 2009). Whatever our verdict on\n(MAsemantic), the semantics of ability-ascriptions remains\nan unresolved and potentially rich issue at the boundary of\nlinguistics and the philosophy of action.\n5. New approaches to ability\n\nThe foregoing has indicated serious concerns about the adequacy of the\northodox approaches to ability and its ascription: the conditional\nanalysis (CA), and the modal analysis (MA), of which (CA) is arguably\njust a special case. This raises the question of what a\nnon-hypothetical and non-modal account of ability and its ascription\nmight look like.\n\nSince abilities are, as noted in Section 1.1, a kind of power, one\nnatural idea is to analyze abilities in terms of some other kind of\npower. This appeal may proceed in different ways. One is by appealing\nto dispositions, and by analyzing abilities in terms of this\npurportedly better-understood kind of power. Another is by departing\nmore radically from the standard ontology of recent metaphysics, and\nanalyzing ability in terms of some new and distinctive variety of\npower. We will consider these approaches in turn in Sections 5.1 and\n5.2. Finally, in Section 5.3, we will turn to miscellaneous\nalternative approaches to ability, which reject the conditional and\nmodal analyses, but which do not purport to analyze abilities in terms\nof powers either.\n5.1 The \u2018new dispositionalism\u2019\n\nIn recent years several authors have revisited the thought that we may\ngive a broadly hypothetical account of ability, without endorsing the\nproblematic claim (CA). This is the view of ability that has been\ndefended by Smith (2003), Vihvelin (2004, 2013), and Fara\n(2008). Following Clarke (2009), we may label this view the\n\u2018new dispositionalism.\u2019\n\nWhat unifies the new dispositionalists is that they return to the\nconditional analysis of ability in light of two thoughts. The first\nthought is one already noted: that there is a variety of power,\ndispositions, that is similar in many respects to abilities. The\nsecond thought is that there are well-known problems of giving a\nconditional analysis of dispositions, in light of which many\nauthors have been inclined to reject the long-assumed link between\ndispositions and conditionals. Taken together, these thoughts yield a\npromising new line on abilities: that though we ought to reject the\nconditional analysis of abilities, we may yet defend a\ndispositional account of abilities.\n\nWhy ought we reject the conditional analysis of dispositions? Consider\nthe following analysis of the disposition to break when struck:\n\n(CD) x is disposed to break when struck iff S would\nbreak if S were struck.\n\n\nDespite the intuitive appeal of (CD), there appear to be at least two\nkinds of counterexamples to it. First, consider a crystal glass that,\nif it were about to be struck, would transform into steel. This glass\nis disposed to break when struck, but it is not true that it would\nbreak if struck\u2014the transformation renders this false. This is a\ncase of finking, in the language of Martin 1994. Second,\nconsider a crystal glass stuffed with styrofoam packaging. This glass\nis disposed to break when struck, but it is not true that it would\nbreak if struck\u2014the packaging prevents this. This is a case of\nmasking, in the language of Johnston 1992. In light of such\ncases, it seems we ought to reject (CD).\n\nThe bearing of these points on our earlier discussion of the\nconditional analysis is the following. There appear to be quite\ngeneral problems for giving a conditional analysis of powers.\nSo it may be that the failures of the conditional analysis of ability\nwere not due to any fact about abilities, but rather to a shortcoming\nof conditional analyses generally. One way of overcoming this problem,\nif this diagnosis is correct, is to analyze abilities directly in\nterms of dispositions.\n\nSuch an analysis is proposed by Fara 2008, who argues:\n\nS has the ability to A in circumstances C\niff she has the disposition to A when, in circumstances\nC, she tries to A. (Fara 2008, 848)\n\n\nThe similarity of this analysis to the hypothetical analyses canvassed\nearlier are clear. This raises several immediate questions, such as\nwhether this analysis can overcome the problem of sufficiency that\nplagued those approaches (see Fara 2008, 851\u2013852 for an\naffirmative answer, and Clarke 2009, 334\u2013336 for some doubts).\nWhat is most striking about the new dispositionalists, however, is how\nthey bring this sort of account of ability to bear on certain familiar\ncases.\n\nConsider how the new dispositionalism bears on so-called\n\u2018Frankfurt cases.\u2019\u00a0These are cases due to Frankfurt\n1969, where an agent chooses to and performs some action A\nwhile at the same time there is some other action B such\nthat, had the agent been about to choose B, an\n\u2018intervener\u2019 would have altered the agent\u2019s brain so\nthat the agent would have chosen, and performed, A instead.\nOne question about such cases is whether the agent, in the actual\nsequence of events, had the ability to B. Frankfurt\u2019s\nintuition, and that of most others, is that she did not. Given the\nfurther claim that the agent is nonetheless morally responsible for\ndoing A, this case appears to be a counterexample to the what\nFrankfurt calls the Principle of Alternative Possibilities (PAP): an\nagent is morally responsible for Aing only if she had the\nability to perform some action other than A.\n\nThe new dispositionalists disagree. Let us focus on Fara\u2019s\ndiagnosis of the case. The question of whether the agent had the\nability to B turns, for Fara, on the question of whether she\nwas disposed to B when she tried to B. Fara\nclaims\u00a0that she does have such a disposition. The\npresence of the intervener is, on Fara\u2019s view, like the\naforementioned styrofoam packaging in a crystal glass. It\nmasks the disposition of the glass to break when struck, but\ndoes not remove that disposition. Similarly, Fara argues, the\npresence of the intervener masks the agent\u2019s disposition\nto B when she tries to B, but does not\nremove that disposition. (There is some disagreement among\nthe new dispositionalists about whether this is a case of finking or\nmasking; see Clarke 2009, 340 for discussion). So, pace\nFrankfurt, the agent does have the ability to B after all.\nAnd so we have, in this case at least, no counterexample to PAP.\n\nA natural worry at this point is that the new dispositionalist has\nsimply changed the subject. For it seems clear that,\u00a0in\na perfectly ordinary sense of ability, Frankfurt\u2019s agent\nlacks the ability to do otherwise. An account of ability\nwhich denies this seems to be speaking of some other concept\naltogether. One way of bringing out what is missing is the idea that\nthere seems to be a connection between my abilities, in the sense of\nability that is relevant to free will, and what is up to me.\nClarke claims\u00a0that this sort of connection fails on the new\ndispositionalist view of ability:\n\nAlthough the presence of a fink or mask that would prevent one\u2019s\nAing is compatible with having a general capacity (the\nunimpaired competence to A), there is an ordinary sense in\nwhich in such circumstances an agent might well be unable to\nA \u2026 If there is something in place that would prevent\nme from Aing should I try to A, if it is not up to\nme that it would so prevent me, and if it is not up to me that such a\nthing is in place, then even if I have a capacity to A, it is\nnot up to me whether I exercise that capacity. (Clarke 2009, 339)\n\n\nThus the objection is that, while the new dispositionalist has perhaps\noffered a theory of something, it is not a theory of\nability.\n\nHow should the new dispositionalist respond? One thought is that we\nare here again encountering the distinction between general and\nspecific abilities. The new dispositionalist might contend that, while\nthe agent in a Frankfurt case may lack the specific ability to do\notherwise, she has the general ability to do otherwise, and that it is\nthis general ability of which the new dispositionalist is giving an\naccount.\n\nThis response, however, postpones a crucial and much broader question.\nThe question is this: should \u2018ability\u2019 in (PAP) be\nunderstood as general ability, or specific ability? If general ability\nis what matters, then Frankfurt cases may indeed not tell against\n(PAP), for the agent retains the general ability to do otherwise. If\nit is specific ability that matters, however,\u00a0the challenge to\n(PAP) stands (see also Whittle 2010). This is a vital question for\nunderstanding the purported connection between agents\u2019 abilities\nand questions of moral responsibility, whatever our verdict on new\ndispositionalism itself. (See Cyr and Swenson 2019\u00a0for a helpful\nrecent discussion of these issues).\n5.2 Abilities as distinctive powers\n\nAs noted in Section 1.1, dispositions are simply one member of the\nbroader family of powers, albeit one that has figured prominently in\nrecent metaphysics. An alternative account of abilities might give an\naccount of abilities in terms of some other kind of power, perhaps one\nbetter-suited to the distinctive aspects of abilities.\n\nOne account of this kind is developed in a series of works by Barbara\nVetter (especially Vetter 2015). Vetter proposes that our basic modal\nnotion should be potentiality. On a traditional view (which\nVetter rejects) dispositions involve a dyadic relation between a\nstimulus and a manifestation (for example: a glass is disposed to\nbreak when struck). In contrast, potentials involve a monadic relation\nto a manifestation (for example: a glass has the potential to break).\nThis makes potentials especially well-suited to give an account of\nabilities, which also appear to involve a monadic relation to an act,\nnamely the act denoted by the complement of an ability-ascription (for\nexample: I am able to play tennis). To have an ability, Vetter argues,\nis simply to have a certain kind of potentiality. Vetter also provides\nan explicit semantics for agentive modality in terms of the ascription\nof potentiality (Vetter 2013), which constitutes a systematic\nalternative to (MA).\n\nYet another view is suggested by recent work by Helen Steward\nemphasizing the traditional idea of a \u2018two-way power\u2019\n(Steward 2012, Steward 2020; see also Alvarez 2013). Steward argues\nthat actions are exercises of two-way powers \u2014 \u2018powers\nwhich an agent can exercise or not at a given moment, even holding all\nprior conditions at that moment fixed\u2019 (Steward 2020, 345).\nThese are to be contrasted with one-way powers, which manifest\nwhenever their manifestation conditions are realized, as a fragile\nglass breaks whenever it is struck. Unlike both the new\ndispositionalists on the one hand and Vetter on the other, Steward\nsees a fundamental asymmetry between agents, who are bearers of\ntwo-way powers, and mere objects, who are are bearers only of one-way\npowers. It is natural then to think that what it is to have an ability\nis to have a two-way power of a certain kind, and that a theory of\nability should follow from an account of agency and the two-way\npowers.\n\nWe thus have at least three \u2018power-based\u2019 views of\nabilities: the new dispositionalism, Vetter\u2019s potentiality-based\nview, and Steward\u2019s two-way power-based view. It is instructive\nto consider how these three accounts differ with respect to two larger\nphilosophical projects.\n\nOne is the project of giving an analysis of modal language, including\nability-ascriptions, in terms of possible worlds. The new\ndispositionalist rejects (CA) and (MA) but she is still, in principle,\nsympathetic with that project, insofar as she allows that disposition\nascriptions themselves may be ultimately understood in terms of\nquantification over possible worlds. This kind of view is explicitly\nendorsed, for instance, by Smith (2003). In contrast, Vetter is\nexplicitly opposed to this project, while Steward\u2019s view appears\nneutral on this question.\n\nAnother is the project of arguing that agents\u2019 abilities are, or\nare not, compatible with the possibility of determinism. This is a\nquestion we touched on briefly in Section 5.1. As noted there, the new\ndispositionalists are motivated, in part, by the project of arguing\nfor compatibilism. In contrast, Steward is explicitly concerned to\ndefend incompatibilism. (Vetter appears to be neutral on this\nquestion.) The question of how the analysis of ability bears on the\nfree will debates looms over many of these discussions, and we will\nconfront it directly and at some length below in Section 6.\n5.3 Other approaches\n\nStill other approaches to ability reject (CA) and (MA) while rejecting\nalso the thought that some appeal to power \u2014 be it a\ndisposition, a potentiality, or a two-way power \u2014 is needed to\naccount for abilities.\n\nOne recurrent thought is that, despite the various challenges that\nhave been brought against it, ability is still intimately connected to\nsome kind of relation between an agent\u2019s volitions (tryings,\nintendings) and her actions. One semantically sophisticated\ndevelopment of this thought is Mandelkern et al, 2017, which proposes\nto take as basic a notion of \u2018practically available\nactions,\u2019 and to develop in terms of these a semantics for\nagentive modality, one on which conditionals linking volitions to\nactions continue to play an essential role. Another approach, in a\nrecent book-length treatment of ability (Jaster 2020), proposes that\nabilities should be thought of in terms of proportions of cases where\nan agent successfully does what she intends to do (compare the\napproach to dispositions advocated in Manley and Wasserman 2008). Both\nof these approaches are explicit in their denial of (CA), but they\nshare \u2014 with the new dispositionalists \u2014 the thought that\nthe analysis of ability should somehow appeal to a pattern of\ndependence between volition and action.\n\nThis is not surprising. The conditional analysis is a redoubtable\nproposal, endorsed by many of the major figures in English-language\nphilosophy. In light of that, it seems reasonable to try to discard\nthe letter of (CA), but retain its spirit. For it may be that the\nhistorical failure of (CA) is due to difficulties and oversights that\nour perhaps firmer grasp of technical issues allows us to overcome.\nThis is a sensible and well-motivated project, though it remains to be\nseen whether it will be, in the end, a successful one.\n\nThere remain still other accounts that do not fit easily into the\ntaxonomy provided here. These include primitivist proposals, which\ntake ability or some closely related notion as analytically\nfundamental. One development of this idea is Maier 2015, who proposes,\ncontrary to most authors, that specific ability is fundamentally prior\nto general ability. He argues that we should give an account of\ngeneral ability in terms of specific abilities, which he calls\n\u2018options\u2019: roughly, an agent has the general ability to A\niff she normally has A as an option. Options, in turn, are primitives.\nMuch here will hang on saying more about options, and in what sense\nthey figure as primitives in the theory of agency.\n\nFinally, an outline of a proposal by David Lewis (dated to 2001 but\nonly recently published as Lewis 2020) offers an altogether different\napproach to ability. Lewis is motivated, like many proponents of (CA),\nby the goal of defending compatibilism, but he takes (CA) to be\nunsatisfactory. He therefore proposes a non-conditional analysis of\nability. His analysis, roughly, is that S has the ability to\nperform an action B just in case there is some basic\naction A such that (i) S\u2019s doing A\nwould cause or constitute S\u2019s doing B and (ii)\nthere is no obstacle to S\u2019s doing A. The\nproblem of giving a theory of ability then becomes the problem of\ngiving a theory of obstacles, something at which Lewis, in his\noutline, makes a beginning. (See\u00a0Beebee et al 2020\u00a0for\nadditional discussion).\n\nLewis\u2019s proposal is an inspiration for further research in at\nleast two ways. First, it indicates that Lewis, a systematic philosopher of modality, saw the\nproblem of giving an analysis of ability as a significant outstanding\nproject. Second, it demonstrates that genuinely novel approaches to\nability remain available, and the project of giving a theory of\nability may yet be in its early stages.\n6. Abilities and the free will debates\n\nThus far our questions about abilities have been formal ones: we have\nbeen asking what it is to have an ability without concerning ourselves\nwith the substantive work that a theory of ability might have to do.\nBut there is much work to be had for a theory of ability: abilities\nhave figured as unexplained explainers in a range of philosophical\ntheories, for example in accounts of concepts (Millikan 2000), of\nknowledge (Greco 2009, Sosa 2007), and of \u2018knowing what it\u2019s\nlike\u2019 (Lewis 1988). Perhaps the most prominent substantive role\nfor a theory of ability\u00a0has been the uses to which accounts of\nability have been put in the free will debates. So let us close with a\nbrief survey of what work a theory of ability might be expected to do\nin those debates.\n\nQuestions about abilities have figured most prominently in debates\nover compatibilism. \u2018Compatibilism\u2019 is used in many ways,\nbut let us understand it here as the thesis that the ability to\nperform actions one does not perform is compossible with the truth of\ndeterminism, which we may take to be the view that the facts about the\npast and the laws jointly determine the facts about the present and\nall future moments. (We should sharply distinguish this view, which we\nmight call classical compatibilism, from more recent views\nsuch as the \u2018semi-compatibilism\u2019 of Fischer and Ravizza\n1998). Insofar as compatibilism, so understood, has been explicitly\ndefended, these defenses have made appeal to theories of ability,\nnotably the conditional analysis and its variants, as well as the\ndispositionalist analysis favored by the new dispositionalists.\n\nIn the discussion of the conditional analysis, we distinguished\nbetween global and local counterexamples to\nhypothetical theories of ability, where the former appealed to the\nfact that any such theory would render ability compatible with\ndeterminism which, according to the objector, it is not. There we\nnoted the dialectical limitations of such counterexamples, namely the\ncontentiousness of their main premise. But compatibilists have often\nbeen guilty of what seems to be the opposite mistake. Namely, they\nhave offered theories of ability which show abilities to be compatible\nwith determinism, and have argued from this to the claim that\nsuch abilities are indeed compatible with determinism.\n\nThe shortcomings of this strategy are nicely diagnosed by Peter van\nInwagen. After surveying the local counterexamples that arise for\nvarious hypothetical theories of ability, van Inwagen imagines that we\nhave arrived at the best possible hypothetical theory of ability,\nwhich he labels \u2018the Analysis\u2019. van Inwagen then\nwrites:\n\nWhat does the Analysis do for us? How does it affect our understanding\nof the Compatibility Problem? It does very little for us, so far as I\ncan see, unless we have some reason to think it is correct.\nMany compatibilists seem to think that they need only present a\nconditional analysis of ability, defend it against, or modify it in\nthe face of, such counter-examples as may arise, and that they have\nthereby done what is necessary to defend compatibilism. That is not\nhow I see it. The particular analysis of ability that a compatibilist\npresents is, as I see it, simply one of his premisses; his central\npremiss, in fact. And premisses need to be defended. (van Inwagen\n1983, 121)\n\n\nvan Inwagen\u2019s point is that, provided the incompatibilist has\noffered arguments for the claim that such abilities are\nincompatible with determinism\u2014as, in van Inwagen\u2019s\npresentation, the incompatibilist has\u2014the production of an\nanalysis is as yet no answer to those arguments. For those arguments\nare also arguments, inter alia, against the\ncompatibilist\u2019s favored account of ability.\n\nThere are, then, several obstacles for the compatibilist who wishes to\nappeal to an account of ability in defense of compatibilism. First,\nthere is the general difficulty of actually giving an extensionally\nadequate theory of ability. In addition, we have now turned up a\ncouple of more specific challenges to the compatibilist. There is van\nInwagen\u2019s point just outlined, namely that arguments for the\nincompatibility of abilities and determinism are, inter alia,\narguments against any theory of ability that is congenial to the\ncompatibilist. And, finally, there is the point that we encountered in\nour discussion of the new dispositionalism in Section 5.1, which is\nthat certain platitudes about ability \u2014 in particular, those\ninvolved in certain judgments about moral responsibility \u2014 may\nbe recalcitrant to compatibilist treatments. Taken together, these\npoints seem to pose a serious obstacle to any theory of ability that\nis both compatible with determinism and in accord with our ordinary\njudgments about what ability requires.\n\nWhat is the compatibilist to say in light of these obstacles? One\nresponse is to make a distinction between two kinds of compatibilist\nproject. (Compare Pryor 2000 on responses to skepticism). One project\nis to convince someone moved by the incompatibilist\u2019s\narguments to retreat from her position. Call this ambitious\ncompatibilism. For precisely the reasons van Inwagen gives, it is\ndoubtful that any theory of ability will suffice for a defense of\nambitious compatibilism. There is another project, however, that the\ncompatibilist might be engaging in. Let us say that, for some reason\nor other, she herself is not convinced by the incompatibilist\u2019s\nargument. She is still left with an explanatory burden, namely to\nexplain, if only to her own satisfaction, how it could\nbe that abilities are compatible with the truth of determinism.\nHere the compatibilist\u2019s aim is not to convince the\nincompatibilist of the error of her ways, but simply to work out a\nsatisfactory conception of compatibilism. Let us call this\nmodest compatibilism. This distinction is not often made, and\nit is not always clear which of these projects classical\ncompatibilists are engaged in. If the latter project is indeed part of\nclassical compatibilism, then we may grant many of the above points\nwhile still granting the theory of ability a central place in defenses\nof compatibilism. For it may be that, though a theory of ability is of\nno use to the ambitious compatibilist, it has a crucial role to play\nin the defense of modest compatibilism.\n\nEven these compatibilist aspirations, however, may be overly\noptimistic, or at least premature. For in surveying theories of\nability we have turned up serious difficulties, for both hypothetical\nand non-hypothetical approaches, which do not appear to turn on issues\nabout determinism. So it may be that the best hope for progress is to\npursue theories of ability while setting to one side the problems\nraised in the free will debates. For given the difficulties posed by\nabilities, and given the significance of theories of ability for areas\nof philosophy quite removed from the free will debates, there is\nsomething to be said for pursuing a theory of ability while embracing,\nif only temporarily, a certain quietism about the puzzles that\ndeterminism may pose.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Albritton, Rogers, 1985. \u201cFreedom of Will and Freedom of\nAction,\u201d <em>Proceedings and Addresses of the American\nPhilosophical Association</em>, 59: 239\u2013251.", "Alvarez, Maria, 2013. \u201cAgency and Two-Way Powers,\u201d\n<em>Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society</em>, 113:\n101\u2013121.", "Austin, J.L., 1956. \u201cIfs and Cans,\u201d <em>Proceedings of\nThe British Academy</em>, 42: 107\u2013132.", "Beebee, Helen, Whittle, Ann, and Svedberg, Maria, 2020.\n\u201cNihil Obstat: Lewis\u2019s Compatibilist Account of\nAbilities,\u201d <em>The Monist</em>, 103: 245\u2013261.", "Bengson, John and Moffett, Marc (eds.), 2011. <em>Know How: Essays\non Mind, Knowledge, and Action</em>, Oxford: Oxford University\nPress.", "Bennett, Jonathan, 2003. <em>A Philosophical Guide to\nConditionals</em>, Oxford: Oxford University Press.", "Bhatt, Rajesh, 1999. <em>Covert Modality in Non-Finite\nContexts</em>, Ph.D. Dissertation, University of Pennsylvania.\n[<a href=\"http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1033&amp;context=ircs_reports\" target=\"other\">Bhatt 1999 available online</a>]", "Brown, Mark, 1988. \u201cOn The Logic of Ability,\u201d\n<em>Journal of Philosophical Logic</em>, 17: 1\u201326.", "Carnap, Rudolf, 1936 &amp; 1937. \u201cTestability and\nMeaning,\u201d <em>Philosophy of Science</em>, 3: 419\u2013471,\n4:1\u201340.", "Cartwright, Nancy, 1994. <em>Nature\u2019s Capacities and Their\nMeasurement</em>, Oxford: Oxford University Press.", "Clarke, Randolph, 2009. \u201cDispositions, Abilities to Act, and\nFree Will: The New Dispositionalism,\u201d <em>Mind</em>, 118:\n323\u2013351.", "Curley, Edward, 1984. \u201cDescartes on the Creation of the\nEternal Truths,\u201d <em>The Philosophical Review</em>, 93:\n569\u2013597.", "Cyr, Taylor and Swenson, Philip, 2019. \u201cMoral Responsibility\nwithout General Ability,\u201d <em>The Philosophical Quarterly</em>,\n69: 22\u201340.", "Davidson, Donald, 1963. \u201cActions, Reasons, Causes,\u201d in\nDavidson 1980: 3\u201319", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1973. \u201cFreedom to Act,\u201d in\nDavidson 1980: 63\u201381.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1980. <em>Essays on Actions and\nEvents</em>, Oxford: Oxford University Press.", "Fara, Michael, 2008. \u201cMasked Abilities and\nCompatibilism,\u201d <em>Mind</em>, 117: 843\u2013865.", "Fischer, John Martin, 1979. \u201cLehrer\u2019s New Move:\n\u2018Can\u2019 in Theory and Practice,\u201d <em>Theoria</em>, 45:\n49\u201362.", "Fischer, John Martin and Ravizza, Mark, 1998. <em>Responsibility\nand Control: A Theory of Moral Responsibility</em>, Cambridge:\nCambridge University Press.", "Frankfurt, Harry, 1969. \u201cAlternate Possibilities and Moral\nResponsibility,\u201d <em>The Journal of Philosophy</em>, 66:\n829\u2013839.", "Gettier, Edmund, 1963. \u201cIs Justified True Belief\nKnowledge?\u201d, <em>Analysis</em>, 23: 121\u2013123.", "Gibson, James J., 1979. <em>The Ecological Approach to Visual\nPerception</em>, Boston: Houghton Mifflin.", "Ginet, Carl, 1980. \u201cThe Conditional Analysis of\nFreedom,\u201d in van Inwagen (ed.), <em>Time and Cause: Essays\nPresented to Richard Taylor</em>, Dordrecht: D.
