    "main_text": "The logic of definitions || Vicious-Circle Principle\n2.8 Circular definitions\n\nThe paradoxes can also be used to motivate a conclusion that is the\nvery opposite to Russell\u2019s. Consider the following definition of\na one-place predicate \\(G\\): \n\\[\\tag{24} \\begin{align*}\nGx \\eqdf x = \\text{Socrates} &\\vee (x = \\text{Plato} \\amp Gx) \\\\\n &\\vee (x = \\text{Aristotle} \\amp {\\sim}Gx). \n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\nThis definition is essentially circular; it is not reducible to one in\nnormal form. Still, intuitively, it provides substantial guidance on\nthe use of \\(G\\). The definition dictates, for instance, that Socrates\nfalls under \\(G\\), and that nothing apart from the three ancient\nphilosophers mentioned does so. The definition leaves unsettled the\nstatus of only two objects, namely, Plato and Aristotle. If we suppose\nthat Plato falls under \\(G\\), the definition yields that Plato does\nfall under \\(G\\) (since Plato satisfies the definiens), thus\nconfirming our supposition. The same thing happens if we suppose the\nopposite, namely, that Plato does not fall under \\(G\\); again our\nsupposition is confirmed. With Aristotle, any attempt to decide\nwhether he falls under \\(G\\) lands us in an even more precarious\nsituation: if we suppose that Aristotle falls under \\(G\\), we are led\nto conclude by the definition that he does not fall under \\(G\\) (since\nhe does not satisfy the definiens); and, conversely, if we suppose\nthat he does not fall under \\(G\\), we are led to conclude that he\ndoes. But even on Plato and Aristotle, the behavior of \\(G\\) is not\nunfamiliar: \\(G\\) is behaving here in the way the concept of truth\nbehaves on the Truth Teller (\u201cWhat I am now saying is\ntrue\u201d) and the Liar (\u201cWhat I am now saying is not\ntrue\u201d). More generally, there is a strong parallel between the\nbehavior of the concept of truth and that of concepts defined by\ncircular definitions. Both are typically well defined on a range of\ncases, and both display a variety of unusual logical behavior on the\nother cases. Indeed, all the different kinds of perplexing logical\nbehavior found with the concept of truth are found also in concepts\ndefined by circular definitions. This strong parallelism suggests that\nsince truth is manifestly a legitimate concept, so also are concepts\ndefined by circular definitions such as (18). The paradoxes, according\nto this viewpoint, cast no doubt on the legitimacy of the concept of\ntruth. They show only that the logic and semantics of circular\nconcepts is different from that of non-circular ones. This viewpoint\nis developed in the revision theory of definitions.\n\nIn this theory, a circular definition imparts to the defined term a\nmeaning that is hypothetical in character; the semantic value\nof the defined term is a rule of revision, not as with\nnon-circular definitions, a rule of application. Consider\n(18) again. Like any definition, (18) fixes the interpretation of the\ndefiniendum if the interpretations of the non-logical\nconstants in the definiens are given. The problem with (18) is that\nthe defined term \\(G\\) occurs in the definiens. But suppose that we\narbitrarily assign to \\(G\\) an interpretation\u2014say we let it be\nthe set \\(U\\) of all objects in the universe of discourse (i.e., we\nsuppose that \\(U\\) is the set of objects that satisfy \\(G)\\). Then it\nis easy to see that the definiens is true precisely of Socrates and\nPlato. The definition thus dictates that, under our hypothesis, the\ninterpretation of \\(G\\) should be the set \\(\\{ \\text{Socrates},\n\\text{Plato}\\}\\). A similar calculation can be carried out for any\nhypothesis about the interpretation of \\(G\\). For example, if the\nhypothesis is \\(\\{\\text{Xenocrates}\\}\\), the definition yields the\nresult \\(\\{\\text{Socrates}, \\text{Aristotle}\\}\\). In short, even\nthough (18) does not fix sharply what objects fall under \\(G\\), it\ndoes yield a rule or function that, when given a hypothetical\ninterpretation as an input, yields another one as an output. The\nfundamental idea of the revision theory is to view this rule as a\nrevision rule: the output interpretation is better than the\ninput one (or it is at least as good; this qualification will be taken\nas read). The semantic value that the definition confers on the\ndefined term is not an extension\u2014a demarcation of the universe\nof discourse into objects that fall under the defined term, and those\nthat do not. The semantic value is a revision rule.\n\nThe revision rule explains the behavior, both ordinary and\nextraordinary, of a circular concept. Let \\(\\delta\\) be the revision\nrule yielded by a definition, and let \\(V\\) be an arbitrary\nhypothetical interpretation of the defined term. We can attempt to\nimprove our hypothesis \\(V\\) by repeated applications of the rule\n\\(\\delta\\). The resulting sequence, \n\\[ V, \\delta(V), \\delta(\\delta(V)), \\delta(\\delta(\\delta(V))),\\ldots, \\]\n\n\nis a revision sequence for \\(\\delta\\). The totality\nof revision sequences for \\(\\delta\\), for all possible initial\nhypotheses, is the revision process generated by \\(\\delta\\).\nFor example, the revision rule for (18) generates a revision process\nthat consists of the following revision sequences, among others:\n\n\\[ U, \\{\\text{Socrates}, \\text{Plato}\\}, \\{\\text{Socrates}, \\text{Plato}, \\text{Aristotle}\\}, \\{\\text{Socrates}, \\text{Plato}\\},\\ldots \\]\n \n\\[ \\{\\text{Xenocrates}\\}, \\{\\text{Socrates}, \\text{Aristotle}\\}, \\{\\text{Socrates}\\}, \\{\\text{Socrates}, \\text{Aristotle}\\},\\ldots \\]\n\n\nObserve the behavior of our four ancient philosophers in this process.\nAfter some initial stages of revision, Socrates always falls in the\nrevised interpretations, and Xenocrates always falls outside. (In this\nparticular example, the behavior of the two is fixed after the initial\nstage; in other cases, it may take many stages of revision before the\nstatus of an object becomes settled.) The revision process yields a\ncategorical verdict on the two philosophers: Socrates\ncategorically falls under \\(G\\), and Xenocrates categorically falls\noutside \\(G\\). Objects on which the process does not yield a\ncategorical verdict are said to be pathological (relative\nto the revision rule, the definition, or the defined concept). In\nour example, Plato and Aristotle are pathological relative to (18).\nThe status of Aristotle is not stable in any revision sequence. It is\nas if the revision process cannot make up its mind about him.\nSometimes Aristotle is ruled as falling under \\(G\\), and then the\nprocess reverses itself and declares that he does not fall under\n\\(G\\), and then the process reverses itself again. When an object\nbehaves in this way in all revision sequences, it is said to be\nparadoxical. Plato is also pathological relative to \\(G\\),\nbut his behavior in the revision process is different. Plato acquires\na stable status in each revision sequence, but the status he acquires\ndepends upon the initial hypothesis.\n\nRevision processes help provide a semantics for circular\n definitions.[14]\n They can be used to define semantic notions such as\n\u201ccategorical truth\u201d and logical notions such as\n\u201cvalidity.\u201d The characteristics of the logical notions we\nobtain depend crucially on one aspect of revision: the number of\nstages before objects settle down to their regular behavior in the\nrevision process. A definition is said to be finite iff,\nroughly, its revision process necessarily requires only finitely many\nsuch\n stages.[15]\n For finite definitions, there is a simple logical calculus,\n\\(\\mathbf{C}_{0}\\), that is sound and complete for the revision\n semantics.[16]\n With non-finite definitions, the revision process extends into the\n transfinite.[17]\n And these definitions can add considerable expressive power to the\nlanguage. (When added to first-order arithmetic, these definitions\nrender all \\(\\Pi^{1}_{2}\\) sets of natural numbers definable.) Because\nof the expressive power, the general notion of validity for non-finite\ncircular definitions is not axiomatizable (Kremer 1993). We can give\nat best a sound logical calculus, but not a complete one. The\nsituation is analogous to that with second-order logic.\n\nLet us observe some general features of the revision theory of\ndefinitions. (i) Under this theory, the logic and semantics of\nnon-circular definitions\u2014i.e., definitions in normal\nform\u2014remain the same as in the traditional account. The\nintroduction and elimination rules hold unrestrictedly, and revision\nstages are dispensable. The deviations from the traditional account\noccur only over circular definitions. (ii) Under the theory, circular\ndefinitions do not disturb the logic of the ground language. Sentences\ncontaining defined terms are subject to the same logical laws as\nsentences of the ground language. (iii) Conservativeness holds. No\ndefinition, no matter how vicious the circularity in it, entails\nanything new in the ground language. Even the utterly paradoxical\ndefinition \n\\[ Gx \\eqdf {\\sim}Gx \\]\n\n\nrespects the Conservativeness requirement. (iv) Eliminability fails to\nhold. Sentences of the expanded language are not, in general,\nreducible to those of the ground language. This failure has two\nsources. First, revision theory fixes the use, in assertion and\nargument, of sentences of the expanded language but without reducing\nthe sentences to those of the ground language. The theory thus meets\nthe Use criterion, but not the stronger one of Eliminability. Second,\nin this theory, a definition can add logical and expressive power to a\nground language. The addition of a circular definition can result in\nthe definability of new sets. This is another reason why Eliminability\nfails.\n\nIt may be objected that every concept must have an extension, that\nthere must be a definite totality of objects that fall under the\nconcept. If this is right then a predicate is meaningful\u2014it\nexpresses a concept\u2014only if the predicate necessarily demarcates\nthe world sharply into those objects to which it applies and those to\nwhich it does not apply. Hence, the objection concludes, no predicate\nwith an essentially circular definition can be meaningful. The\nobjection is plainly not decisive, for it rests on a premiss that\nrules out many ordinary and apparently meaningful predicates (e.g.,\n\u2018bald\u2019). Nonetheless, it is noteworthy because it\nillustrates how general issues about meaning and concepts enter the\ndebate on the requirements on legitimate definitions.\n\nThe principal motivation for revision theory is descriptive. It has\nbeen argued that the theory helps us to understand better our ordinary\nconcepts such as truth, necessity, and rational choice. The ordinary\nas well as the perplexing behavior of these concepts, it is argued,\nhas its roots in the circularity of the concepts. If this is correct,\nthen there is no logical requirement on descriptive and explicative\ndefinitions that they be non-circular.\n\nFor more detailed treatments of these topics, see Gupta 1988/89, Gupta\nand Belnap 1993, and Chapuis and Gupta 1999. See also the entry on the\n revision theory of truth.\n For critical discussions of the revision theory, see the papers by\nVann McGee and Donald A. Martin, and the reply by Gupta, in Villanueva\n1997. See also Shapiro 2006.\n",
