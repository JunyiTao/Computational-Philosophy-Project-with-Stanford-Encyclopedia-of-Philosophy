    "main_text": "Epistemology || Open-Mindedness\n4.4 Open-Mindedness\n\n\nOpen-mindedness raises similar issues to modesty and humility in\nthat it involves taking a special attitude to oneself. Some deny this;\nHare (1985), for example, argues that open-mindedness is nothing more\nthan treating evidence in an impartial way. Others take it to be\nstrongly related to one\u2019s own epistemic position: Adler (2004)\nsees it as a way of responding to counter-evidence to one\u2019s own\nbeliefs, Riggs (2010) sees it as a type of self-knowledge and\nself-monitoring, and Baehr (2011) sees it as involving a detachment\nfrom one\u2019s default point of view because one wants to get to the\ntruth.\n\n\nThough it is often talked about as an epistemic view (see Zagzebski\n1996), it is also discussed as a moral virtue too. Arpaly (2011) sees\nit as a disposition to change our beliefs without being opinionated out\nof moral concern. McRae (2016) also sees it as involving moral concern\nbut also a willingness to consider alternate self-narratives, linking\nit with equanimity in the Buddhist tradition. This casts\nopen-mindedness as a freedom from certain mental habits involving the\nself and its place in the world.\n",
