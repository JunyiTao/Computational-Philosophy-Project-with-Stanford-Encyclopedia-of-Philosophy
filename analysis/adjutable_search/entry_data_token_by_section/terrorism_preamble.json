    "main_text": "\n\nBefore the terrorist attacks in the United States on 11 September\n2001, the subject of terrorism did not loom large in philosophical\ndiscussion. Philosophical literature in English amounted to a few\nmonographs and a single collection of papers devoted solely, or\nlargely, to questions to do with terrorism. Articles on the subject in\nphilosophy journals were few and far between; neither of the two major\nphilosophy encyclopedias had an entry. The attacks of September 11 and\ntheir aftermath put terrorism on the philosophical agenda: it is now\nthe topic of numerous books, journal articles, special journal issues,\nand conferences.\n\nWhile social sciences study the causes, main varieties, and\nconsequences of terrorism and history traces and attempts to explain\nthe way terrorism has evolved over time, philosophy focuses on two\nfundamental\u2014and related\u2014questions. The first is\nconceptual: What is terrorism? The second is moral: Can terrorism ever\nbe morally justified?\n\nPhilosophers have offered a range of positions on both questions. With\nregard to the problem of defining terrorism, the dominant approach\nseeks to acknowledge the core meaning \u201cterrorism\u201d has in\ncommon use. Terrorism is understood as a type of violence. Many\ndefinitions highlight the experience of terror or fear as the\nproximate aim of that violence. Neither violence nor terror is\ninflicted for its own sake, but rather for the sake of a further aim\nsuch as coercion, or some more specific political objective. But there\nare also definitions that sever the conceptual connection of terrorism\nwith violence or with terror. With regard to the moral standing of\nterrorism, philosophers differ both on how that is to be determined\nand what the determination is. Consequentialists propose to judge\nterrorism, like everything else, in light of its consequences.\nNonconsequentialists argue that its moral status is not simply a\nmatter of what consequences, on balance, terrorism has, but is rather\ndetermined, whether solely or largely, by what it is. Positions on the\nmorality of terrorism range from justification when its consequences\non balance are good, or when some deontological moral requirements are\nsatisfied, to its absolute, or almost absolute, rejection.\n\nPhilosophers working in applied philosophy have also sought to\ncomplement the discussions of terrorism in general with case\nstudies\u2014studies of the role and rights and wrongs of terrorism\nin particular conflicts, such as \u201cthe Troubles\u201d in\nNorthern Ireland (George 2000; Simpson 2004; Shanahan 2009), the\nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict (Ashmore 1997; Gordon and Lopez 2000; Primoratz 2006;\nKapitan 2008; Law (ed.) 2008), and the bombing of German cities in\nWorld War II (Grayling 2006; Primoratz 2010).\n",
