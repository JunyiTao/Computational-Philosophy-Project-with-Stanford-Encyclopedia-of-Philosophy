    "main_text": "Points of Dispute || Experience & Justification\n5.1 Experience & Justification\n\nA central reason for pursuing an Intellectualist reading of Kant is\nthat such a reading is taken (most notably by Sellars and McDowell) to\nbe the best or even only way to secure an explanation of how\nperception can play a justificatory rather than merely causal role in\nthe adoption of empirical belief. If intuition is autonomous of\nintellectual capacities, so the objection goes, it cannot play a\njustificatory role in the acquisition or adoption of empirical belief.\nVersions of this objection have often, since Wilfred Sellars\u2019\nfamous paper (Sellars 1956, reprinted in Sellars 1963), gone under the\nmoniker of the \u201cMyth of the Given\u201d (McDowell 1996, 1998,\n2007b, 2008). While it is not straightforward as to how Kant\u2019s\ntexts or arguments yield any substantive connection with the concerns\narticulated by Sellars and McDowell, this entry examines three\npossible ways of understanding such a connection.\n\nThe exact nature of objections to a supposedly mythical\n\u201cGiven\u201d vary, as do their putative connections to\nKant\u2019s arguments (Watkins 2008, 2012). One objection made by\nSellars is that justifiers for belief must have a compositional,\nfact-like structure that mirrors the propositional structure of\nbelief. Sensory experiences (understood as sensations), on\nSellars\u2019 view, are particulars rather than facts and so cannot\nplay any justificatory role (Sellars 1963: 128; cf. BonJour 1985: ch.\n4). Thus, the view goes, if the belief caused by an experience (such\nas the belief you might have that there is a computer screen before\nyou) and thereby adopted by you is also to be justified by that\nexperience, then the experience itself must be able to function as a\npremise in an argument for which the relevant belief is the\nconclusion. This is the \u201cpremise principle,\u201d as it has\nbeen called in contemporary epistemology (Pryor 2005). Acceptance of\nthe premise principle thus plays a significant role in motivating the\nposition that sensory experience without propositional (i.e.,\nconceptual) content cannot justify belief.\n\nA passage in Kant typically adduced in support of this point is the\n\u201csame function\u201d passage at A79/B104\u20135 (e.g., Sellars\n1968: 4\u20135; McDowell 2004: 79; Haag 2007: 150\u2013151, 199, and\nch. 8; Kalderon 2011: 235\u2013236; cf. Pippin 1982: 99\u2013101;\nHeidegger 1997: 45\u201346; Longuenesse 1998: 200; Gr\u00fcne 2009:\n107\u2013111). On this reading of Kant, sense experience would have\nthe requisite proposition-like structure, and thus be capable of\nstanding in justificatory relations to beliefs, only if the same\ncapacities that structure the contents of judgment for Kant (viz. the\nlogical forms) would also structure sensory experience (via\napplication of the categories). While such interpreters are surely\ncorrect that Kant\u2019s aim, as exemplified in that passage, is to\nshow that the very same cognitive capacities that connect\nrepresentations in a mental act of judging are also in play in the\nconnection of representations in a sensory experience, it is not\nobvious how the passage directly supports any argument concerning the\nepistemic significance of sensory experience to empirical belief and\nknowledge. What is particularly unclear is whether Kant endorses the\npremise principle in the substantive manner required for the\nSellars/McDowell position. Hence, further work needs to be done to\nshow that Kant actually (or even counterfactually) endorses the\npremise principle.\n\nA second objection against the Given, which might also be attributed\nto Kant, is that the mere occurrence of a sensory experience cannot\njustify any particular belief that is the causal result of that\nexperience. Instead, sensory experience can only play its\njustificatory role against a background of concepts possessed by the\nexperiencing subject (Sellars 1963: 170; McDowell 1998:\n435\u2013436). Though this position is often taken to support some\nform of Intellectualism (e.g., McDowell 1996; Ginsborg 2006b), it is\nalso compatible with forms of Sensibilism that construe the conditions\nfor empirical knowledge as resting at least in part on the possession\nof intellectual capacities, even if such capacities are not necessary\nfor perceptual intentionality as such (e.g., Hanna 2001: 46\u201365;\n2005: 256\u2013257; Bird 2006: 193\u2013207; Watkins 2008, 2012;\nAllais 2009: 392\u2013394; Tolley 2013: 125\u2013127; McLear 2015:\n98\u2013106, 2020a; Golob 2016a, forthcoming).\n\nThird, both Sellars and McDowell claim that it is simply a mistake to\nthink that mental states that are purely the upshot of causal\ninteractions with the world could themselves stand as reasons for\nempirical belief. Sellars (1963) remarks that such a mistake is\n\u201cof a piece with the so-called \u2018naturalistic\nfallacy\u2019 in ethics\u201d (146). Sellars himself gives no clear\nargument for this claim. McDowell focuses on the distinction between\nthe kind of mental state for which its bearer is in some way\nresponsible, such as a belief, and the kind of state that simply\nhappens to one, like a headache (McDowell 1996: chs. 1\u20132; 1998:\n433\u2013434; 2004: 80\u201385; cf. Engstrom 2006: 8\u201313). The\nsuggested parallel in an Intellectualist reading of Kant is that if\nintellectual capacities are necessary for the occurrence of perceptual\nexperience, then experience is not merely something that causally\nhappens to the subject but rather is something for which the subject\nherself is at least partially responsible, in much the same way that\nshe is responsible for her endorsement in belief of the content of a\npropositional judgment. It is certainly a centrally held tenet of\nKant\u2019s critical view that the intellect, including understanding\nand reason, actively contributes to the content of cognition and the\nacquisition of knowledge (Paton 1947: 218; Pippin 1987; Allison 1990,\n1996: chs. 4, 7 and 9; Willaschek 2006; McLear 2020b). As Kant\nfamously says,\n\n\n[O]ne cannot possibly think of a reason that would consciously receive\ndirection from any other quarter with respect to its judgments; since\nthe subject would then attribute the determination of his judgment,\nnot to his reason but to an impulse. Reason must regard itself as the\nauthor of its principles independently of alien influences.\n(Groundwork 4:448)\n\n\nBut it is not at all clear whether appreciation of this point requires\nIntellectualism. For example, perhaps sensory experiences do not\nthemselves stand as reasons on Kant\u2019s view, but rather provide\naccess to the reasons or evidence for holding a particular\nbelief (McLear 2016a: \u00a78.5), knowledge of the successful\nreference of the concepts constituting the content of that belief\n(McLear 2016b: 127\u2013134), or reference \u00fcberhaupt\n(Allais 2015: ch. 11). Moreover, if Kant does not accept the premise\nprinciple or something like it then there is even more potential for\nSensibilism to maneuver.\n",
