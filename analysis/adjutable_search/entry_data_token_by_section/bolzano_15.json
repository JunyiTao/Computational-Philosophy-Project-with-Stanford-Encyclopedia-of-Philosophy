    "main_text": "Epistemology and Philosophy of Science || Judgments A Priori and A Posteriori\n4.3 Judgments A Priori and A Posteriori\n\nUsing the distinction between intuitions and other ideas, Bolzano is\nnow able to draw an important epistemological distinction among\npropositions and in particular also among true propositions: A\nproposition is a conceptual proposition iff it does not\ncontain any intuition but consists exclusively of concepts, such as\nthe propositions [God is omnipotent], [Gratefulness is a duty], or\n[\\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is irrational]; all the other propositions are called\n\u2018empirical propositions\u2019 (or also\n\u2018perceptual propositions\u2019) by Bolzano, e.g. [That is a\nflower], or [Socrates was an Athenian] (WL II, 33 f.). There is no\nproblem in transferring this distinction from the sphere of\npropositions to the sphere of judgments, since (as already mentioned)\nby every judgment a certain proposition is uniquely determined (via\nrelation \\(\\mathbf{G})\\) as its \u201cmaterial\u201d (WL III,\n115).\n\nAt first glance, this objective distinction among propositions seems\nto be far away from the Kantian distinction between judgments a\npriori and a posteriori. Nevertheless, the two\ndistinctions are closely interrelated, and they almost coincide (WL\nII, 36); hence, Bolzano warns against confusing them (WL IV, 451 f.).\nThe close relationship of the two distinctions becomes obvious as soon\nas we ask ourselves how to discover of a conceptual or an empirical\nproposition whether or not it is true: In the case of conceptual\npropositions, it is mere reflection, i.e., an inner\n\u201cinspection\u201d of our subjective concepts, without any\nexperience, that is required to find out whether or not it is true,\nwhereas in the case of an empirical proposition experience is\nindispensable for judging its truth or falsity (WL II, 36). This\nKantian distinction of the different ways of recognizing the truth or\nfalsity of such judgments, however, as important as it is, must be\nbased on the more fundamental objective distinction between conceptual\nand empirical propositions on Bolzano\u2019s view.\n\nEmpirical propositions contain at least one intuition. Most important\nare those empirical propositions whose subject idea is an intuition.\nThese are propositions about perceptions or sensations, i.e., in\nBolzano\u2019s words, about certain changes in our minds, caused by\nother inner events or by external sensory stimuli. The subject idea of\na \u201cprivate\u201d empirical proposition of this kind is usually\nexpressed by a word such as \u2018that\u2019, denoting, e.g., a\ncertain color sensation. No wonder that the indexicals\n\u2018that\u2019 and \u2018I\u2019 play such a prominent role in\nBolzano\u2019s epistemology (in WL III) although they do not have a\nplace in his logical World 3 (cf. section 3.4). The reason for this\nseems to be that our empirical knowledge is based on immediate\nperceptual judgments, i.e., judgments that \u201cgrasp\u201d (in the\nsense of \\(\\mathbf{G})\\) a certain kind of an empirical proposition.\nThe subjective subject idea of such an immediate perceptual judgment\nis a subjective intuition for whose expression an indexical such as\n\u2018that\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019 seems to be indispensable.\n\nBolzano quite clearly faced the problem of how to get from these\nimmediate perceptual judgments, whose objects are completely\n\u201cprivate\u201d phenomena which we usually denote by means of\nindexicals, to an objective description of our world. His epistemology\ntherefore reminds us in many respects of the discussions concerning\nprotocol sentences among the representatives of phenomenalism and\nphysicalism in the Vienna Circle, and even more of Bertrand\nRussell\u2019s program in his Inquiry into Meaning and Truth\n(1940). The highly interesting similarities between Bolzano\u2019s\nand Russell\u2019s program still await further investigation.\n",
