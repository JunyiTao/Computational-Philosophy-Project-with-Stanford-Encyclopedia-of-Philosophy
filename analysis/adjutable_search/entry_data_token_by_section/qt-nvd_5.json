The \\(\\delta\\) function was used by physicists before\nDirac, but it became a standard tool in many areas of physics only\nafter Dirac very effectively put it to use in quantum mechanics. It\nthen became widely known by way of his textbook (Dirac 1930), which\nwas based on a series of lectures on quantum mechanics given by Dirac\nat Cambridge University. This textbook saw three later editions: the\nsecond in 1935, the third in 1947, and the fourth in 1958. The fourth\nedition has been reprinted many times. Its staying power is due, in\npart, to another innovation that was introduced by Dirac in the third\nedition, his bra-ket formalism. He first published this formalism in\n(Dirac 1939), but the formalism did not become widely used until after\nthe publication of the third edition of his book. There is no question\nthat these tools, first the \\(\\delta\\) function and then the bra-ket\nnotation, were extremely effective for physicists practicing and\nteaching quantum mechanics both with regards to setting up equations\nand to the performance of calculations. Most quantum mechanics\ntextbooks use \\(\\delta\\) functions and plane waves, which are key\nelements of Dirac\u2019s formal framework, but they are not included\nin von Neumann\u2019s rigorous mathematical framework for quantum\nmechanics. Working physicists as well as teachers and students of\nquantum mechanics often use Dirac\u2019s framework because of its\nsimplicity, elegance, power, and relative ease of use. Thus, from the\nstandpoint of pragmatics, Dirac\u2019s framework is much preferred\nover von Neumann\u2019s. The notion of a rigged Hilbert space placed\nDirac\u2019s framework on a firm mathematical foundation.\n",
