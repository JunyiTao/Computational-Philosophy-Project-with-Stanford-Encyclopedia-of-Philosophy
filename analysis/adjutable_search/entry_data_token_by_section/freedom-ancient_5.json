Voluntary Action, Moral Responsibility, and What is \u201cUp to Us\u201d\n\nAncient Greek philosophers considered when we are rightly held\naccountable for our actions, and these discussions overlap\nconsiderably with contemporary debates about free will and\ndeterminism. But we should be cautious about framing these debates in terms of their views on free will and determinism.\nFirst of all, there is no phrase in the ancient texts that should\nobviously be translated as \u201cfree will\u201d. (The later\nEpicurean Lucretius uses the Latin phrase libera voluntas,\nwhich is often translated as \u201cfree will\u201d, but whether\nlibera voluntas is the same as \u201cfree will\u201d is far\nfrom obvious\u2014see section\n 2.4.1\n below.) Instead of talking about whether humans possess a faculty of\nwill, and what the conditions are for that will to be free, they talk\nabout when actions are voluntary, and what must obtain in order for\nour actions or states of character to be \u201cup to us\u201d\n(eph\u2019 hemin) or to \u201cdepend on us\u201d\n(par\u2019 hemas). Secondly, the ancient discussions do not\nhave at their center the question of whether causal determinism is\ncompatible with our having control over our actions\u2014in\nparticular, whether it is compatible with the ability to do\notherwise\u2014although they do raise this issue.\n",
