The locus of style\n\nIn a book entitled \u201cIntroducci\u00f3n al estilo\nmatematico\u201d (1971) the Spanish philosopher Javier de Lorenzo\nattempted to write a history of mathematics (admittedly partial) in\nterms of style. Although by 1971 Granger\u2019s work, to be discussed\nin section 5, had already appeared, de Lorenzo was not aware of it and\nthe only source on style he uses is Chevalley\u2019s article. Indeed\nthis book is merely an extension of Chevalley\u2019s study to include\nmany more \u2018styles\u2019 that have appeared in the history of\nmathematics. The list of mathematical styles studied by de Lorenzo is\nthe following:\n\nGeometric style;\nPoetic style;\nCossic style;\nCartesian-algebraic style;\nThe style of indivisibles;\nOperational style;\nEpsilon style;\nSynthetic vs analytical styles in geometry;\nAxiomatic style;\nFormal style.\n\n\nThe general set up reminds one much of Chevalley\u2019s approach and\none would look in vain in de Lorenzo\u2019s book for a satisfactory\naccount of what style is. It is true that there are some interesting\nobservations about the role of language in determining a style but a\ngeneral philosophical analysis is missing. There is however an\nimportant point to be emphasized concerning the treatment given by\nChevalley and de Lorenzo, which seems to point to an important feature\nof the use of \u2018style\u2019 in mathematics.\n\nIn his paper \u201cDe la cat\u00e9gorie de style en histoire\ndes sciences\u201d (Gayon 1996), and in the later Gayon 1999,\nJean Gayon presents the different usages of \u2018style\u2019 in the\nhistoriography of science as falling between two camps (in a way he\nfollows Hacking 1992 here). First, there is the usage of\n\u2018scientific style\u2019 on the part of those who pursue a\n\u2018local history of science\u2019. Usually this type of analysis\nfocuses on \u2018local groups or schools\u2019 or on\n\u2018nations\u2019. For instance, this type of history deemphasizes\nthe universal component of knowledge and stresses the difficulties\ninvolved in translating experiments from one setting to another. Such\ndifficulties are shown to depend on the \u2018local\u2019\ntraditions, which include specific technical and theoretical know-how\nwhich is \u201cfundamental to setting-up, realizing, and analyzing\nthe outcome of those experiments\u201d (Corry 2004b) Secondly, there\nis the use of \u2018scientific style\u2019 exemplified in works such\nas Crombie\u2019s 1994 \u2018Styles of Scientific Thinking in the\nEuropean Tradition\u2019. Crombie enumerates the following scientific\nstyles:\n\npostulation in the axiomatic mathematical sciences\nexperimental exploration and measurement of complex detectable\nrelations\nhypothetical modelling\nordering a variety by comparison and taxonomy\nstatistical analysis of populations, and\nhistorical derivation of genetic development (quoted from Hacking\n1996, 65)\n\n\nGayon remarks that this latter notion of \u2018style\u2019 could be\nreplaced by \u2018method\u2019 and that \u2018the styles discussed\nhere have nothing to do with local styles\u2019. He also remarks that\nwhen it comes to local styles the groups that act as sociological\nsupport for such analyses are either \u2018research groups\u2019 or\n\u2018nations\u2019. There has been much emphasis in recent history\nof the experimental sciences on such local factors (see, for instance,\nGavroglu 1990 for the \u2018styles of reasoning\u2019 of two low\ntemperature laboratories, that of Dewar (London) and that of\nKamerlingh Onnes (Leiden)).\n\nHistorians of mathematics are now attempting to apply such\nhistoriographical approaches also to pure mathematics. A recent\nattempt in this direction is the work of Epple in terms of\n\u2018epistemic configurations\u2019 such as his recent article on\nAlexander and Reidemeister\u2019s early work in knot theory (Epple\n2004; but see also Rowe 2003 and 2004, and Epple 2011). The support\ngroups for such investigations are not referred to as\n\u2018schools\u2019 but rather as \u2018mathematical\ntraditions\u2019 or \u2018mathematical cultures\u2019.\n\nWhat about the \u2018methodological\u2019 notion of style \u00e0\nla Crombie? Have historians of mathematics made much use of this?\nApart from numerous treatments of the first style (axiomatic method),\nthere is not much in this area but an interesting historical\ncontribution is Goldstein\u2019s work on Frenicle de Bessy (2001).\nShe argues that the pure mathematics as practiced by Frenicle de Bessy\nhad much in common with the Baconian style of experimental science.\nPerhaps one should mention here that experimental mathematics is now a\nblossoming field which might soon find its historian (see Baker 2008\nfor a philosophical account of experimental mathematics and\nS\u00f8rensen 2016 for an analysis in terms of mathematical\ncultures). This tends to be a topic of high interest for philosophers,\nas it impinges on issues of mathematical method. The problem can be\nsimply put as follows: in addition to what Crombie lists as\nmethodological style (a) [axiomatic], what other styles are pursued in\nmathematical practice? Corfield 2003 touches upon the problem in the\nintroduction to his book \u201cTowards a philosophy of\n\u2018real\u2019 mathematics\u201d when he, referring to the\nCrombie list above, says:\n\nHacking applauds Crombie\u2019s inclusion of (a) as \u2018restoring\nmathematics to the sciences\u2019 (Hacking 1996) after the logical\npositivists\u2019 separation, and extends the number of its styles to\ntwo by admitting the algorithmic style of Indian and Arabic\nmathematics. I am happy with this line of argument, especially if it\nprevents mathematics been seen as an activity totally unlike any\nother. Indeed, mathematicians also engage in styles (b) (see chapter\n3), (c) and (d) [7] and along the lines of (e) mathematicians are\ncurrently analyzing the statistics of the zeros of the Riemann zeta\nfunction. (Corfield 2003, 19)\n\n\nIn note 7 Corfield mentions John Thompson\u2019s comment to the\neffect that the classification of finite simple groups is an exercise\nin taxonomy.\n\nIt is not the goal of this essay to address squarely the vast set of\nissues that emerge from the previous quotes. But it should be pointed\nout that these issues represent a fresh and stimulating territory for\na descriptive epistemology of mathematics and that some work has\nalready been carried out in this direction (see Etcheverr\u00eda\n1996; van Bendegem 1998; Baker 2008).\n\nFinally, how to put together the \u2018local\u2019 and\n\u2018methodological\u2019 styles with what is found in Chevalley\nand de Lorenzo? In the case of mathematics there is good evidence that\nthe most natural locus for \u2018styles\u2019 falls, so to speak, in\nbetween these two categories. Indeed, by and large, mathematical\nstyles go beyond any local community defined in simpler sociological\nterms (nationality, direct membership in a school etc.) and are such\nthat the support group can only be characterized by the specific\nmethod of enquiry pursued. On the other hand, the method is not so\nuniversal as to be identifiable as one of the six methods described by\nCrombie or in the extended list given by Hacking. Here are some\npossible examples, where the names attached to each position should\nnot mislead the reader into thinking that one is merely dealing with\n\u2018individual\u2019 styles.\n\nDirect vs. indirect techniques in geometry (Cavalieri and\nTorricelli vs. Archimedes)\nAlgebraic vs. geometrical approaches in analysis in the\nseventeenth and the eighteenth century (Euler vs. McLaurin)\nGeometrical vs. analytical approaches in complex analysis in the\nnineteenth century (Riemann vs. Weierstrass)\nConceptual vs. computational approaches in algebraic number theory\n(Dedekind vs. Kronecker)\nstructural vs intuitive styles in algebraic geometry (German\nschool vs. Italian school)\n\n\nOf course, it might just be the case that also in history and\nphilosophy of science there are \u2018intermediate\u2019 levels of\nstyle such as the ones being described here (one example that comes to\nmind is \u2018Newtonian style\u2019 in mathematical physics) but the\nfact that Jean Gayon did not detect them as central seems to point to\nthe fact that the situation in history and philosophy of mathematics\nis quite different, as these \u2018intermediate\u2019 styles are\nthose that have been more thoroughly discussed and that correspond to\nthe styles analyzed by Chevalley and de Lorenzo. Moreover, discussions\nof local mathematical cultures tend to do without the concept of\nstyle.\n",
