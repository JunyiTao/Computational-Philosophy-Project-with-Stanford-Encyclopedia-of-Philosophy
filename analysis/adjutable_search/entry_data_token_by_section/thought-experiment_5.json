    "main_text": "Current Views on Thought Experiments || The Intuition\u2013Based Account\n4.2 The Intuition\u2013Based Account\n\nWhat we term the \u201cintuition\u2013based account\u201d of\nthought experiments comes in a naturalistic version (see Brendel 2004;\nGendler 2007), and in a Platonic version (see Brown 1991a [2011]). We\nbegin with a discussion of the latter. Brown holds that in a few\nspecial cases we do go well beyond the old empirical data to acquire a\npriori knowledge of nature (see also Koyr\u00e9 1968). Galileo\nshowed that all bodies fall at the same speed with a brilliant thought\nexperiment that started by destroying the then reigning Aristotelian\naccount. The latter holds that heavy bodies fall faster than light\nones (H > L). But consider Figure 6, in which a\nheavy cannon ball (H) and light musket ball (L) are\nattached together to form a compound object (H+L);\nthe latter must fall faster than the cannon ball alone. Yet the\ncompound object must also fall slower, since the light part will act\nas a drag on the heavy part. Now we have a contradiction:\nH+L > H and H >\nH+L. That\u2019s the end of Aristotle\u2019s\ntheory. But there is a bonus, since the right account is now obvious:\nthey all fall at the same speed (H = L =\nH+L).\n\n\n\nFigure 6. Galileo: \u201cI don\u2019t\neven have to look\u201d\n\n\nBrown claims this is a priori (though still fallible) knowledge of\nnature, since there are no new data involved, nor is the conclusion\nderived from old data. Moreover, is it some sort of logical truth (for\na technical challenge of this claim see Urbaniak 2012). This account\nof thought experiments can be further developed by linking the a\npriori epistemology to accounts of laws of nature that hold that laws\nare relations among objectively existing abstract entities. It is thus\na form of Platonism, not unlike Platonic accounts of mathematics such\nas that urged by Kurt G\u00f6del.\n\nThe two most often repeated arguments against this sort of Platonism\nare: it does not identify criteria to distinguish good from bad\nthought experiments, and it violates the principle of ontological\nparsimony. These seem weak objections. Perhaps they find widespread\nacceptance because Platonism seems to be unfashionable these days (see\nGrundmann 2018), given the general popularity of various forms of\nnaturalism. If intuitions really do the job in a thought experiment,\nthe first objection is weak because neither rationalists nor\nempiricists have a theory about the reliability of intuitions. So the\nobjection should be that intuitions probably just do not matter in\nhuman cognition. However, there are good reasons to question the truth\nof this claim (see Myers 2004). This is not to marginalize the\nproblems that arise when admitting intuitions as a source of knowledge\nand justification, especially in philosophy (see Hitchcock 2012).\n\nAs for the second objection, the appeal to Occam\u2019s razor is in\ngeneral problematic when it is employed to rule out a theory. Whatever\nwe eliminate by employing the principle of parsimony, we can easily\nreintroduce it by an inference to the best explanation (see Meixner\n2000). And this is exactly what a Platonist contends his or her\nPlatonism about thought experimenting to be, while conceding that the\nPlatonic intuition appears miraculous. But are they really more\nmiraculous than sense perception, which seems similar in many respects\nto Platonic intuition? One might want to say yes, because supposedly\nwe have no clue at all how Platonic intuition works but we do have\nsome idea about the nature of sense perception. We know that if an\nobject is far away it appears smaller in vision, and under certain\nlight conditions the same object can look quite different. However, is\nit really impossible to state similar rules to capture the nature of\nPlatonic intuition? If you are drunk or lack attention you most\nprobably will not be very successful in intuiting anything of\nphilosophical value.\n\nA review of the relevant psychological literature will reveal further\ncriteria that could be employed to identify good and bad conditions\nfor Platonic intuition while thought experimenting. Yet, proponents of\nthe naturalistic version of the intuition\u2013based account wonder\nhow necessary Platonism is once this move is entertained in defence of\nthe reliability of intuitions (see Mi\u0161\u010devi\u0107 2004).\nElke Brendel defines intuitions as mental propositional attitudes\naccompanied with a strong feeling of certainty. In her view, we can\ntell two stories to make sense of their cognitive power and\nplasticity. One story relates to our biological constitution and\nevolutionary past. The other is about membership in specialized\ncommunities. Brendel\u2019s account raises many questions, but it is\ndifficult to resist its appeal. A universal set is appealing to anyone\nnot trained in logic because most things we are familiar with can come\nin sets, such as books, tables, and philosophers. A set of all sets\nseems intuitively plausible. The intuition disappears once you worked\nyourself through the problems arising from the idea of a set of all\nsets. Brendel is quick to insist that such relativity of our\nintuitions doesn\u2019t imply that they are cognitively useless.\nWithout intuitions, we probably wouldn\u2019t have knowledge, and\nthought experiments are sometimes the only way to access the\nintuitions that guide us in our cognitive lives (see Brendel\n2004).\n",
