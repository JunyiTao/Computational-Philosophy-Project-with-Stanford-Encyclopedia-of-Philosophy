How do we know what it will take\nto get our product to whomever wants or needs it most? Maybe we take\nbids. As we (and our rivals) take bids for x, x\ncomes to have a price. As with language, prices enable people to form\nmutual expectations. Free-floating prices help people coordinate in\nintricate and mutually considerate ways as they individually decide\nwhat to produce or consume. To think that an authority needs to decide\nwhat the price of rice ought to be is like thinking that an authority\nneeds to decide what sound people should make when they want to refer\nto rice.\n\nIt is a mundane yet intriguing fact that price signals induce people\nto respond to information they do not possess: such as the changing\ncost of drilling, or the discovery of a cheap substitute, or that\npolitical unrest has made a key input harder to acquire. Having no\ninkling of those variables, buyers nevertheless respond to them in a\nrational way, because they know the one thing they need to know:\nnamely, the price (Hayek 1978a, 4).\n\n\nAssume that somewhere in the world a new opportunity for the use of\nsome raw material, say, tin, has arisen, or that one of the sources of\nsupply of tin has been eliminated. It does not matter for our\npurpose\u2014and it is very significant that it does not\nmatter\u2014which of these two causes has made tin more scarce. All\nthat the users of tin need to know is that some of the tin they used\nto consume is now more profitably employed elsewhere and that, in\nconsequence, they must economize tin (Hayek 1945, 526).\n\n",
