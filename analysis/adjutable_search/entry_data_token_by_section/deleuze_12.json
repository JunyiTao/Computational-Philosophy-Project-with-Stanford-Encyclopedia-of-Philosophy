    "main_text": "The Reception of Deleuze || Deleuze and science\n6.3 Deleuze and science\n\nDeleuze was aware of the finitist revolution in the history of the\ndifferential calculus, despite Sokal and Bricmont\u2019s 1999\nintimations otherwise. He writes in Difference and\nRepetition, \u201cit is a mistake to tie the value of the symbol\ndx to the existence of infinitesimals; but it is also a\nmistake to refuse it any ontological or gnoseological value in the\nname of a refusal of the latter. In fact, there is a treasure buried\nwithin the old so-called barbaric or pre-scientific interpretations of\nthe differential calculus, which must be separated from its\ninfinitesimal matrix. A great deal of heart and a great deal of truly\nphilosophical naivety is needed in order to take the symbol\ndx seriously \u2026\u201d (170). It seems obvious here\nthat Deleuze\u2019s treatment of early forms of the differential\ncalculus is not meant as an intervention into the history of\nmathematics, or an attempt at a philosophy of mathematics, but as an\ninvestigation seeking to form a properly philosophical concept of\ndifference by means of extracting certain forms of thought from what\nhe clearly labels as antiquated mathematical methods. (For positive\nviews of Deleuze\u2019s use of mathematics as provocations for the\nformation of his philosophical concepts, see the essays in Duffy\n2006.)\n\nMassumi 1992 and DeLanda 2003 attempt to show that Deleuze\u2019s\nepistemology and ontology can be brought together with the results of\ncontemporary dynamical systems theory (popularly known as\n\u201cchaos\u201d and \u201ccomplexity\u201d theory). Bell 2006\nfollows up on this work. Protevi 2001 looks at the accompanying\nnotions of hylomorphism and self-organization in the history of\nphilosophy; Bonta and Protevi 2004 treat Deleuze and dynamic systems\ntheory with regard to its potentials for geographical work. For other\nissues on Deleuze and science, see the essays in Marks 2006. Finally,\nAnsell Pearson 1999 brought attention to Deleuze and biology; see also\nToscano 2006 in this regard.\n",
