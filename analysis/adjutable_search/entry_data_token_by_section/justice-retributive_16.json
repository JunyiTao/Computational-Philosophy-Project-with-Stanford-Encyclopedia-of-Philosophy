    "main_text": "Range of issues || Proportionality\n4.4 Proportionality\n\nRetributive justice holds that it would be unjust to punish a\nwrongdoer more than she deserves, where what she deserves\nmust be in some way proportional to the gravity of her crime.\nInflicting disproportionate punishment wrongs a criminal in much the\nsame way as, even if not quite as much as, punishing an innocent\nperson wrongs her (Gross 1979: 436).\n\nOne might wonder how a retributivist can be so concerned with\ndisproportionately punishing while also tolerating the known\ninfliction of excessive suffering (see\n section 4.3.3).\n But there is an important difference between the two: an agent\ninflicting punishment may come to know that a particular individual is\nsuffering more than most would from a particular punishment, but she\nshould see that as just an unfortunate side effect of inflicting a\nproportional punishment; she must aim, however, at inflicting only a\nproportional punishment.\n\nThe possibility of punishing less than deserved is also\nnormatively significant, but it provides a much weaker constraint.\nFirst, it does not seem to wrong anyone in particular (see\nDuus-Otterstr\u00f6m 2013: 472\u2013475). One might think that the\nvictims of crime are wronged if wrongdoers are not punished. But the\nview that it wrongs victims not to punish wrongdoers confuses\nvengeance, which is victim-centered, with retributivism, which is\nagent-centered: concerned with giving the wrongdoer the punishment\nshe deserves (see Paul Robinson's 2008 contrast between\nvengeful and deontological conceptions of deserved punishment).\nSecond, it is clear that in any criminal justice system that allows\nplea-bargaining, intentional deviations below desert will have to be\ntolerated. Russell Christopher (2003) has argued that retributivists\ncannot accept plea-bargaining. But he bases his argument on a number\nof unsound assumptions, including that \u201c[r]etributivism imposes\nan absolute duty to punish culpable wrongdoers whenever the\nopportunity arises\u201d (2003: 101), and that punishing a wrongdoer\nless than she deserves violates her \u201cright to punishment\u201d\n(2003.: 128\u2013129). Both of these have been rejected above.\nChristopher correctly notes that retributivists desire to treat\nequally culpable people alike (2003: 131). But this could be simply\nbecause they desire to give people the treatment they deserve in some\nnon-comparative sense (Alexander and Ferzan 2018: 181), not because\nthey care about equality per se.\n\nThis leaves two fundamental questions that an account of\nproportionality must address: how should we measure the gravity of a\nwrong, and how can a punishment be \u201cproportional\u201d to it?\nThese are addressed in the supplementary document:\n Challenges to the Notion of Retributive Proportionality.\n",
