    "main_text": "Moral Personhood\n4. Moral Personhood\n\nLet me start the analysis of moral personhood in African moral\nphilosophy with a statement made by Ifeanyi Menkiti, an African\nphilosopher from Nigeria:\n\n The various societies found in traditional Africa routinely accept\nthis fact that personhood is the sort of thing which has to be\nattained, and is attained in direct proportion as one participates in\ncommunal life through the discharge of the various obligations defined\nby one's stations.  It is the carrying out of these obligations\nthat transforms one from the it-status of early child-hood, marked by\nan absence of moral function, into the person-status of later\nyears, marked by a widened maturity of ethical sense\u2014an ethical\nmaturity without which personhood is conceived as eluding\none. (Ifeanyi Menkiti, 1984: 176)\n\n\nMenkiti's statement adumbrates a conception of moral personhood, which\nwill now be discussed in some detail. The concept of a person in\nAfrican thought embodies ethical presuppositions. The word used for\n\u201cperson\u201d in the Akan language (undoubtedly the most widely\nspoken language in Ghana) is onipa. But the word\nonipa also means \u201chuman being\u201d and the plural form\nof it means \u201cpeople\u201d. Thus, the word onipa is an\nambiguous word. In the Akan society, when an individual's conduct\nvery often appears cruel, wicked, selfish, ungenerous or unsympathetic,\nit would be said of that individual that \u201che is not a\nperson\u201d (onnye onipa).\n\n\nIn Yoruba language the word eniyan means a person. Even\nthough the word is used in a normative as well as non-normative (or,\nordinary) sense, \u201cgreater emphasis is placed on the normative\ndimension of eniyan\u201d (Gbadagesin, 1991: 27). It can be\nsaid of some human individual that \u2018he or she is not a person\u2019\n(Ki i se eniyan). Such a comment is a \u201cjudgment of the\nmoral standing of the human being who is thus determined to fall short\nof what it takes to be recognized as such\u201d (Gbadagesin, 1991:\n27).\n\n\nThe Akan statement onnye onipa and the Yoruba statement\nKi i se eniyan both underline a conception of moral\npersonhood. The two statements are significant in two ways. The first\nis that, even though that individual is said not to be a\nperson, he is nonetheless acknowledged as a human being, not a\nbeast or fish. It is pretty clear that the statement implies a\ndistinction between the concept of a human being and the concept of a\nperson: an individual can be a human being without being a\nperson.\n\n\nThe second significant thing the statements imply is the assumption\nthat there are certain fundamental norms and ideals to which the\nconduct of a human being, if he is a person, ought to conform,\nthat there are moral virtues that an individual has the capacity to\ndisplay in his conduct and ought to display them, if he is a person.\nThe reason for the judgment that an individual is not a person if he\nbehaves or does not behave in a certain way is that that\nindividual's actions and behavior are considered as falling short\nof the ideals and standards of personhood. But it does not imply at all\nthat an individual considered \u201cnot a person\u201d loses his\nrights as a human being or as a citizen or that people in the community\nshould cease to demonstrate a moral concern for him or display the\nappropriate moral virtues in their treatment of him; only that he is\nnot considered a morally worthy individual.\n\n\nNow, the judgment that a human being is \u201cnot a person\u201d,\nmade in the wake of that individual's persistent unethical\nbehavior, implies that the practice of moral virtue is considered\nintrinsic to the conception of a person held in Akan or Yoruba moral\nthought. The position here is this: for any p, if p\nis person, then p ought to display in his behavior the moral\nnorms and ideals of personhood. When the behavior of a human being\nfails to conform to the acceptable moral principles or standards, or\nwhen a human being fails to display the expected moral virtues in his\nconduct, he is considered to be \u201cnot a\nperson.\u201d\n\n\nThe evaluative judgment opposite to the one we have been considering\nis \u201che is a person\u201d (oye onipa). This judgment is\nnot a descriptive judgment at all, even though it can be used\ndescriptively, as when in a forest one hunter made that judgment to his\ncolleague hunter who thought he saw a beast and was about to shoot it:\nthe judgment \u201che is a person\u201d (oye onipa) would in\nthat context be used descriptively by the other hunter to distinguish a\nhuman being from a beast. Thus, a descriptive use of that judgment\nwould be obvious and easily understood.\n\n\nWhat I am concerned to point up in the present circumstance is the\nnormative form of the judgment. Used normatively, the\njudgment, \u201che is a person,\u201d means \u2018he has a good\ncharacter\u2019, \u2018he is generous\u2019, \u2018he is\npeaceful\u2019, \u2018he is humble,\u2019 \u2018he has respect for\nothers.\u2019 A profound appreciation of the high standards of the\nmorality of an individual's behavior would elicit the judgment,\n\u201che is truly a person,\u201d (oye onipa paa!). A rider\nwould be in place here: while children are actual human beings and are\nmembers of the human community, they are not actual persons yet; they\nare persons only potentially and will attain the status of personhood\nin the fullness of time when they are able to exercise their moral\ncapacity and make moral judgments.\n\n\nNow, the denial of personhood to a human being on the grounds that\nhis actions are not in accord with certain fundamental norms and ideals\nof personhood or that that individual fails to display certain\nvirtues in his behavior is morally significant and worth noting. It\nmeans that human nature is considered in Akan metaphysical and moral\nthought to be essentially good, not depraved or warped by some original\nsin; that the human being is capable of doing good. It does not mean,\nhowever, that personhood, in this model of humanity, is innate but is\nearned in the ethical arena: it is the individual's moral\nachievement that earns him the status of a person. Every individual is\ncapable of becoming a person inasmuch as he has capacity for\nvirtue\u2014for performing morally right actions\u2014and should be treated (at\nleast potentially) as a morally responsible agent.\n\n\nIn this connection, let us pay some attention to the Akan belief\nembedded in a maxim that says, \u201cGod created every human being\n(to be) good\u201d (Onyame boo obiara yie). The view\nexpressed in this proverb seems to be at variance with the notion of\nthe moral-neutrality of the human being discussed earlier in\nconnection with character (section 3). The meaning of the maxim\n\u201cGod created every human (to be) good\u201d is not too clear;\nit may be interpreted in two ways. First, it may be taken as implying\nthat God created the human being actually to do good, that is, to\nactually behave virtuously and to always make the appropriate moral\nchoices. Second, it may be interpreted as meaning that God made the\nhuman being capable of moral choice, that is, that the human being was\nmerely endowed by his creator with the moral sense to distinguish\nbetween good and evil, right and wrong. The first interpretation\nimplies that the human being has been determined to be\ngood\u2014to actually pursue virtue: thus, the human being's\nmoral status is a settled matter. If the human being were created or\ndetermined actually and always to do good, there would never have been\na concept of evil or vice (bone) in Akan moral language,\nsince no human being would, in that kind of moral context, commit a\nvicious or evil act. In light of the evil and unethical actions of\nindividual human beings, the first interpretation which implies that\nthe human being is resiliently good cannot be accepted as the correct\nmeaning of the maxim, for it is plainly contradicted by our putative\nmoral experience. The first interpretation also subverts\nmoral-neutrality, a consequence that eliminates moral choice\u2014basic to\nthe notion of a moral person.\n\n\nThe second interpretation of the view that the human being was created\ngood (or, to be good), implies that the human being merely has the\ncapacity for virtue: that is, could pursue good, but could also pursue\nevil.  This means that the human being is endowed with moral sense\nand, so, has the capacity for both virtue and vice; his judgment on\nsome moral issue could go either direction: direction of the good or\ndirection of the evil. Thus, the notion of moral neutrality is\npreserved. The human being can then be held as a moral agent: not that\nhis virtuous character is a settled matter, but that he is capable of\nvirtue, and hence, of moral achievement, and can, thus, achieve\npersonhood.\n\n\nThe correctness of the second interpretation of the view that the\nhuman being was created good, as argued in the foregoing paragraphs,\ncan have an anchor also in the Akan notion of tiboa:\nconscience, moral sense\u2014a sense of right or wrong. This is a\nconception of an inner urge relevant to moral practice. Tiboa\nis held, among other things, as creating a sense of guilt in the\nindividual, convicting him or her of wrong deeds. Since response to a\nmoral rule is ultimately an individual or private affair, the notion of\ntiboa (conscience) is of great importance to our moral life.\nIt is by virtue of tiboa that the notion of self-sanctioning\nin moral conduct becomes intelligible. Because of its power to induce a\nsense of guilt, tiboa is held to influence the\nindividual's moral choice, decision, response, and attitude. The\nreality or phenomenon of moral choice is a rejection of the notion of a\nfixed or settled moral character of an individual that derives from the\npresupposition\u2014albeit false\u2014that the human being is born\nvirtuous. The activity of tiboa is in line with the\nmoral neutrality of the human being at birth. The activity of\ntiboa assists moral achievement and, thus, moral\npersonhood.\n\n\nLike the Akan people and others, the Rwanda (or, Ruanda) people also\nhave the concept of conscience. \u201cThe Rwanda word for conscience,\nkamera, means something that is internally felt. It is\nsituated in the heart\u201d (J. J. Maquet in Forde, 1954: 183). There\nindeed are external social sanctions which are useful as deterrents\nfrom prohibited behavior; but in moral motivation feelings of moral\nguilt and shame are traceable also to kamera or\ntiboa.\n",
