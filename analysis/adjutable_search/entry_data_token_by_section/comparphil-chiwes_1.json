    "main_text": "Metaphysical and Epistemological Commensurability\n2. Metaphysical and Epistemological Commensurability\n\nOne common portrait of the difference between the Chinese and Western\ntraditions posits a radical incommensurability on the very nature of\nphilosophical inquiry. Chinese philosophy is \u201cwisdom\u201d\nliterature, composed primarily of stories and sayings designed to move\nthe audience to adopt a way of life or to confirm its adoption of that\nway of life. Western philosophy is systematic argumentation and\ntheory. Those who identify philosophy with the latter will commonly\nassert that Chinese thought has no philosophy (see DeFoort, 2001; and\nVan Norden, 2017 for discussion of this aspect of the controversy). Is\nthere such a difference? One reason to think so is the fairly\nwidespread wariness in Chinese philosophy of a discursive rationality\nthat operates by deduction of conclusions about the particular from\nhigh-level generalizations. The seventeenth chapter of the\nZhuangzi notes that the sage-king Yao looked for a suitable\nsuccessor, found the perfect candidate in Shun, and then abdicated so\nthat Shun could take over the throne. The result was glorious.\nHowever, when Kuai imitated Yao the result was disastrous. Tang and Wu\nwere kings who fought and conquered. But Duke Bo also acted on that\nrule, fought, and lost. That is why it is impossible to establish\n\u201cany constant rule.\u201d Inspired by the achievement of\ninsight or wisdom in some particular cases, we create general rules\nthat we believe will work for many other cases in the future. The\nunfortunate result is that our original insights and wisdom are\nmagnified beyond the scope of their applicability. Confucians are more\nwilling to articulate their teachings in the form of principles, but\nsuch principles seem to function as designators of values or general\nconsiderations that ought to be given weight in judgments about what\nto do. Never lost is recognition of the necessity for the exercise of\ndiscretion in judgment according to the particular circumstances at\nhand. The best rules lose applicability in unusual circumstances.\nRules and values conflict in many circumstances, and there are no\n\u201csuper-principles\u201d to supply ready answers. The\nappropriate resolution to each conflict depends very much on the\nsituation. In Mencius 7A35, Mencius is asked what the\nlegendary sage-king Shun would have done if his father had killed a\nman. Mencius replies that the only thing to do would be to apprehend\nhim. Shun could not interfere with the judge, who was acting on the\nlaw. However, Mencius continues, Shun would then have abdicated and\nfled with his father to the seacoast. As Mencius portrays it, then,\nShun\u2019s actions strike a balance between the different values in\ntension with one another. The refusal to interfere with the judge is a\nway of acknowledging the necessity of impartially administering a\nsocial order. At the same time, fleeing with one\u2019s father is\nhonoring the value of greater loyalty to family. Shun manages to honor\nboth values at different moments in his dealing with the situation.\nDeduction from a principle could not yield such a balance. We are\nexpected, however, to learn from stories such as Shun\u2019s,\nprecisely because they function as concrete paradigms for\njudgment-making in the future. When we encounter situations that pose\nsimilar-looking conflicts between impartial concern and familial\nloyalties, we have Shun\u2019s judgment as a resource and a model.\nThat model is not the same as a general principle that would\ndeductively yield a judgment about what to do in the present\nsituation. We must exercise judgment in determining whether new\nsituations are similar enough to the case of Shun, and we must\nexercise judgment as to what actions would be parallel to Shun\u2019s\nactions.\n\nNaes and Hanay (1972) have characterized Chinese philosophy as\n\u201cinvitational\u201d in its method of persuasion, meaning that\nit portrays a way of life in a vivid fashion so as to invite the\naudience to consider its adoption. The Analects, for example,\nportrays the ideal of the junzi (often translated as\n\u201cgentleman\u201d but perhaps more accurately glossed as the\nnoble person) as realized by persons of genuine substance who are\nundisturbed by the failure of others to recognize their merits (1.1:\n\u201cTo be undisturbed by others yet not complain, is this not the\nmark of the junzi?\u201d). In the Mencius\n(2A2), such a person possesses a kind of equanimity or heart\nthat is unperturbed by the prospects of fame and success. This\nunperturbed heart corresponds to the cultivation of one\u2019s\nqi (vital energies) by uprightness. One might be able to see\nsuch passages as appealing to experiences the audience might have in\nits encounters with persons who do seem to possess special strength,\nsubstance, and tranquility through identification with and commitment\nto a cause they perceive to be far greater than themselves. One need\nnot interpret such sayings as attempting to persuade by the pure\nemotive effect of certain words, as in propaganda. Rather, they may\ncorrespond to a way of doing philosophy that attempts to say something\nabout values in life that can be supported by experience, even if not\nall testimony will agree (Kupperman, 1999). The Daoists recommend a\nway of life that they explicitly characterize as one that cannot be\nargued for, but their recommendation receives some support through\ncommonly shared experience. Consider again the notion of\nwuwei and its illustrations in the Zhuangzi through\nstories of exemplary craft. Most famously, Zhuangzi\u2019s Cook Ding\ncuts up an oxen so smoothly and effortlessly that his knife never\ndulls, and it is if he is doing a dance with his knife as it zips\nthrough the spaces between the joints. He does this not through\n\u201cperception and understanding\u201d but through the\nqi, the vital energies of the body. His marvelous skill is\nknowledge of how to adjust his own movements to the spaces within oxen\nso that he and the oxen form seamless wholes. Similarly, Woodcarver\nQing has learned to prepare for carving his marvelous bellstands in\nsuch a way that he clears his mind of all distraction and sees the\nstand within the timber he has selected. Suggested here is a portrait\nof acting in the world that consists of complete and full attention to\npresent circumstances so that the agent can act with the grain of\nthings (the Cook Ding passage refers to tianli or heavenly\npatterns). Such a portrait does resonate with the actual experience of\ncraftspeople, artists, athletes, musicians and dancers who have\nadvanced beyond self-conscious technique and rule-following, who\nbecome fully absorbed in the experience of working with the material,\nthe instruments or in the movement of their bodies, and who experience\ntheir actions as an effortless flow and in fact perform at very high\nlevels. In such ways, Chinese thinkers draw a picture of the world\nthat must in the end be evaluated by explanatory power in some very\nbroad sense. We must ask whether the picture helps make sense of our\nexperience of the world (again in a broad sense of\n\u2018experience\u2019 not limited to quantifiable observations in\nreplicable experiments) and whether it preserves features of that\nexperience that we think are prima facie genuine. Much of\nWestern philosophy must be judged according to the same standard. \n\nSo then, is it right to say that Chinese philosophy is invitational\nwhile Western philosophy is argumentative? One answer is that there is\na difference but that it is more a matter of degree than an absolute\ncontrast. It was Aristotle, after all, who said that discussions about\nthe good in human life cannot be properly assimilated by the young\nbecause they do not have enough experience of life (Nichomachean\nEthics I.3). And Plato despite his insistence on the centrality\nof argumentation to philosophy, dispatches the short analytical\narguments presented in Book I of the Republic in favor of\nlengthy expository portraits of the ideal city-state and the\nharmonious soul for the rest of that work. Those portraits sometimes\npresent only the thinnest of arguments for crucial premises, and at\nother times no argument at all. Some of his claims, about the divisive\neffects of family loyalties and the ill-effects of democracy,\nobviously appeal to experience, even if not all testimony will agree.\nIn fact, it is hard work to find an acknowledged great in the Western\ntradition to whom such characterizations do not apply, at\nleast to some degree. Sometimes, as in Spinoza (The Ethics),\nthe contrast is glaring between the aspiration to prove points by way\nof deductive argument from self-evident axioms and the obvious source\nof those points from experience of life and at best some mix of theory\nand intuition. It is true that much Western philosophy, especially of\nthe late modern variety, and most especially emanating from the United\nKingdom and North America, attempts to establish its claims through\nargumentation that is more rigorous than appeals to experience and\nexplanatory power in the broad sense. But it must also be noted that\nthere is argument in Chinese philosophy. Chad Hansen (1992) has\npointed out the pivotal role of the philosopher Mozi, who criticized\nthe Confucians for an uncritical acceptance of tradition and who\nexplicitly introduced standards for the evaluations of belief. This\nintroduction of argumentation required response in kind. Mencius gives\na Confucian response to to the Mohists and argues on behalf of his\ntheory of human nature as containing the germs or sprouts of the\nethical virtues, in the form of natural dispositions to have certain\nkinds of feeling and judging reactions to situations, such as\ncompassion for a child about to fall into a well (2A6, and see Shun,\n1997 for an extensive analysis of argumentation in the\nMencius text). He defends himself against the arguments of\nrival theorists who hold that human nature has no innate ethical\npredispositions but is neutral (6A). Xunzi, a later Confucian thinker,\nattempts to give a refutation of Mencius\u2019s theory in favor of\nhis own theory that human nature has dispositions that get us into\ntrouble and that ethical norms are an invention designed to avoid that\ntrouble (Xunzi, chapter 23). Methods of argumentation reach\ntheir most sophisticated state of development in Xunzi (See Cua,\n1985).\n\nDifferences in the way philosophy is conceived may reflect differences\nin the interests philosophy is meant to satisfy. Chad Hansen (1992)\npoints to another possible difference in interests \u2013 this time\nin interests that language is meant to satisfy, arguing that the\nclassical Chinese thinkers did not conceive of the primary function of\nlanguage to be descriptive and as attempting to match propositions\nwith states of affairs, but rather as a pragmatic instrument for\nguiding behavior. In fact, Hansen sees the Chinese tradition as\ncentrally concerned with the conflict of daos, which he\ndefines as sets of behavior-guiding practices, including discourses.\nWestern interpreters have been unable to see this, argues Hansen,\nbecause they have imposed their own concerns with correspondence truth\nand metaphysics on the Chinese tradition. They have as a result\nimposed upon Daoism an irrational mysticism focused on a\nmetaphysically absolute Dao. Michael LaFargue (1992) also\nargues that the Daodejing is not to be interpreted as as\nconcerning some metaphysical entity called the Dao, but is\nrather concerned with self cultivation that allows one to have a\ntransforming experience of deep and peaceful stillness within\none\u2019s personal center. Wuwei is the style of action\nthat is rooted in such an experience. David Hall and Roger Ames (1987)\ngive a related interpretation of Confucius, in part reacting against\nHerbert Fingarette\u2019s (1972) influential interpretation of\nConfucius\u2019 Dao as an ideal normative order transcending\nthe contingencies of time, place, history, and culture. Hall and Ames\nargue Confucius\u2019s Dao was not conceived as a tradition\nand language-independent reality against which linguistically\nformulated beliefs were to be measured as reliable or unreliable, but\nin fact a cumulative creation of individuals working from within a\ncontext provided by a society\u2019s tradition, consisting of\ncustoms, conventions, conceptions of proper behavior and good manners,\nconceptions of right conduct and of what is of ultimate value and of\nwhat lives are worth living.\n\nThese interpretations perform valuable functions in questioning what\nis sometimes an unreflective imposition of Western philosophical\nagendas on Chinese thinkers. The debate will go on, however.\nConcerning Confucius, it is true that the Analects often\ndisplays an attitude of tolerance and flexibility in judging where the\nDao lies. On the other side, it can be pointed out that in\nsayings such as 1.2 (filial piety and brotherly love are at the root\nof the virtue of ren or humanity), there is no indication\nthat the claim is limited to Chinese culture but extended to human\nbeings generally. One way to understand it is to take it as saying\nthat human beings have to learn to respond to a kind of authority that\nis not based on force and coercion, but respect and care. Or consider\nthe consistent Confucian theme that rulers cannot hold power simply on\nthe basis of law and punishment. There is no sign such judgments are\nmeant to be limited in scope to one\u2019s own time and place.\nConcerning the Daodejing, it is clear that there are very\nstrong practical concerns underlying the text. A way of life is being\nrecommended (as in Hansen), and perhaps that way of life is rooted in\na certain kind of transforming experience (as in LaFargue). On the\nother side, it could be argued that such practical and experiential\nconcerns do not exclude metaphysical concerns. Consider chapter four\nof that text where Dao is described as being empty, as\nseeming something like the ancestor of the myriad of things, as\nappearing to precede the Lord (di). For something that at\nleast looks metaphysical in the Mencius, consider\naforementioned 2A2, concerning the unperturbed heart that can be\nachieved by cultivating one\u2019s floodlike qi. Such\nqi is vast and unyielding, and if cultivated with uprightness\nwill fill up the space between tian (Heaven) and earth.\nPerhaps the lesson to draw is not that Chinese thinkers lacked\nmetaphysical concerns but that they did not separate practical from\nmetaphysical concerns in the way that contemporary Western thinkers\nmight.\n\nHowever this issue is resolved with respect to the classical Chinese\nthinkers, few have disputed that classical concepts such as that of\nnonbeing eventually acquired frankly metaphysical meanings in\nthe Chinese tradition, where it refers at the least to an\nindeterminate ground in which the determinate \u201cten thousand\nthings\u201d are incipient (Neville, 1989). This embrace of an\nindeterminate ground of the determinate may reflect the decision to\ngive the phenomenon of change a fundamental place in ontology, rather\nthan an absolutely stable being as in Parmenidean ontology and as\nlater reflected in Aristotelian and Cartesian notions of substance\n(Cheng, 1989, 1991). The revival of interest in Chinese metaphysics\nhas partly been fueled by the perception that twentieth century\nphysics has in fact undermined the strategy of giving determinate\nbeing ontological primacy (Zukov, 1979). \n\nThe Neo-Confucian Zhu Xi (Zhuzi yulei) reinterpreted ethical\nthemes inherited from the classical thinkers and reframed them within\na cosmology and metaphysics that was deeply influenced by Daoism and\nBuddhism, even as he asserted the ethical superiority of Confucianism\nover these other philosophies. On his conception of ren as an\nall inclusive virtue, it constitutes the Dao and consists of\nthe fact that the mind of Heaven and Earth to produce things is\npresent in everything, including the mind of human beings. Li\n(not the word for ritual or ritual propriety),the principles or\npatterns of the universe, runs through all things. It runs through the\nmind of human beings and enables them to form \u201cone body\u201d\nwith all things, including a sensitivity to harm that comes to them\nthat is like the response we have to harm to comes to ourselves (see\nShun, 2020). Another great Neo-Confucian, Wang Yang-Ming (Quan\nxilu) is known for his view that genuinely moral knowledge is\ninherently practical and motivated. Knowing goodness is to know to\nlove it (see Huang, 2017). In comparison to Zhu, Wang showed little\ninterest in the sort of empirical investigation of things prescribed\nin the Great Learning but rather a rectification of the mind\nwith evil thoughts. Nevertheless, there are metaphysical commitments\nin Wang that are intimately related to his ethical commitments (see\nIvanhoe, 2017).\n\nWithin the Chinese tradition, Confucian, Daoist and Buddhist\napproaches to understanding the world are broadly similar in their\ntendencies to understand things in terms of their relationships to\nother things and ultimately to the wholes that contain them. Rather\nthan seeing the world as composed of plural substances causally\ninteracting in a linear fashion on the model of a billiard ball\nhitting another billiard ball and setting it into motion, there is a\ntendency to think of systems or wholes, the structures of which are\nconstituted by the relationships between their parts. The paradigms\nhere are biological or organic systems (Wang, 2013). The mode of\nthinking about these relationships in Confucianism and Daoism, has\nbeen termed \u201ccorrelative.\u201d Eminent sinologists have meant\nsignificantly different things by these terms (see Granet, 1934;\nNeedham, 1954; Graham, 1989; Hall and Ames, 1998), but they all seem\nto be pointing to a species of analogical thought identifying\ncorrespondences between kinds (lei). These kinds might be\ndifferentiated according to functions within a structure of\nrelationships, such that those having similar functions in similar\nstructures would be of the same kind. The most general of kinds came\nto be identified as yin and yang, where yin\nis the tendency to contract and yield (associated with darkness and\nthe feminine), and yang is the tendency to expand and\ndominate associated with light and the masculine). A thing that is\nyin has a relationship with something that is yang.\nNatural patterns displayed by interactions within wholes, whether they\nbe the universe or the human body, involve the interaction of things\nthat are yin and yang, and this interaction can\ninvolve opposition, complementarity, and cyclical alternation (Wang,\n2013). \n\nThough the nature of the interactions is sometimes described as\nnon-causal, the contrast is most plausibly made with reference to\nmechanical and linear notions of causation in which the effect (like\nthe second billiard ball hit by the first) is purely passive and\ninert. The interactions envisioned in Chinese thought are not\nnecessarily incompatible with notions of causation in which the cause\n\u201cworks with the tendencies of the thing affected\u201d\n(Perkins, 2019). This is in keeping with the paradigm of wholes being\nthe biological and the organic. A significant example of the more\ndynamic and complex notion of causation is Mencius\u2019 conception\nof the development of moral sprouts in human nature (mentioned in\nsection 1 above and further discussed in section 3 below). To become\nvirtuous is to grow one\u2019s moral sprouts (such as a natural\ncompassion for others\u2019 suffering) into a mature and vigorous\nplant (such as the full virtue of ren or humanity) through\nreflecting on their importance to one\u2019s flourishing as a person\nunder the environmental conditions of secure material livelihood and\nethical education (Mencius 1A7, 6A7, 6A14\u201315). Cultivation of\na person\u2019s virtue, then, is an instance of factors (in this case\nsome external and some internal to the person) interacting with the\ntendencies affected. It is not writing on a blank slate nor is it\ndiscovering something that is already fully there.\n\nTrying to understand something in terms of its relationships to a\nlarger whole has been said to be a characteristic of Chinese (and more\ngenerally East Asian) thought (Nisbett, 2004) and this more holistic\napproach may be contrasted with an analytic approach that begins with\nthe parts and tries to understand the whole in terms of their\nrelationships. These two approaches are not necessarily mutually\nexclusive, and both approaches may be employed at different stages of\ninquiry or to different aspects of the subject matter. If there is a\ndifference between the very broad and internally diverse traditions of\nEast Asia and the West, it is one of the degree and frequency of\ndominance of one approach versus the other. \n\nThe relational approach in Confucian and Daoist philosophies is\napparent in their conceptions of what it is to be a person. The\nConfucian conception of the person is that of a profoundly social\nbeing. Hall and Ames (1998) use the language of the individual\u2019s\nbeing the focal point of an interlocking \u201cfield\u201d of\nrelationships. Henry Rosemont, Jr. (1991b) identifies the individual\nwith the sum total of their social roles. One issue here is whether a\nperson\u2019s identity is wholly constituted by their\nrelationships and how this can be compatible with what Shun (2004) has\nidentified in Confucianism as the capacity to step back from an\nestablished social setup, to criticize it and possibly to reject and\nseparate oneself from it. Hall and Ames, furthermore, want to affirm\nas part of Confucianism the belief in the individual\u2019s power to\ncontribute creatively to the constitution of social roles in the\n\u201cfield,\u201d and the question is how such a power co-exists\nwith being wholly constituted by the field (Wong 2004b). However one\nends up resolving that question, it seems clear that a good part of a\nperson\u2019s identity on the Confucian view must lie in their\nrelationships to other persons, and even the reasons for distancing\nthe self from the established social setup would involve a critical\nethical stance toward that setup based on rightness and humanity\ntogether with realization that these values could not be fully\nrealized in one\u2019s lifetime.\n\nWhereas early Confucianism tends to find the relational elements of\npersonhood in the human social world, early Daoism tends to find them\nin the world at large, especially beyond the human social world.\nReturning to the theme of correlative thinking, Daoism invites human\nbeings to find their most fundamental being in the natural patterns\nthat are more clearly evidenced in the nonhuman natural world and that\ntend to be obscured by developed human social orders and the\nconceptual oppositions embedded in them. People are invited to find\ntheir identities in harmonizing with natural forces. The\nneo-Confucians, in trying to establish the primacy of Confucianism\nover Daoism and Buddhism, incorporated some of the most powerful\nthemes from these rival philosophies, as illustrated by Wang\nYang-Ming\u2019s declaration that human beings form one body with\nHeaven and Earth and the myriad things.\n\nIn Chinese Buddhism, we get an explicit, metaphysical deconstruction\nof the human self in the Buddha\u2019s view of it as a floating\ncollection of various psychophysical reactions and responses with no\nfixed center or unchanging ego entity. He did not deny that we think\nof the self as a fixed and unchanging center, but considered such a\nself a delusion. Our bodily attributes, various feelings, perceptions,\nideas, wishes, dreams, and in general a consciousness of the world\ndisplay a constant interplay and interconnection that leads us to the\nbelief that there is some definite \u2018I\u2019 that underlies and\nis independent of the ever-shifting series. But there is only the\ninteracting and interconnected series. This metaphysical concern, of\ncourse, had deep practical implications for the Buddha. It points\ntoward the answer to human suffering, which ultimately stems from a\nconcern for the existence and pleasures and pains of the kind of self\nthat never existed in the first place. The recognition that none of\nthe \u201cthings\u201d of ordinary life are fixed and separate\nentities, anymore than the self is, leads to a recognition of all of\nlife as an interdependent whole and to the practical attitude of\ncompassion for all of life. In a comparative perspective, one cannot\nhelp but be struck by the similarity between the Buddhist view of the\nself and David Hume\u2019s doubts about the existence of a unitary\nand stable self (Treatise of Human Nature, 1.4.6). Consider\nalso Derek Parfit\u2019s (1984) point that acceptance of a Humean or\na Buddhist view of the self can lead to sense that one is less\nseparate from other selves and to a wider concern when\n\u201cmy\u201d projects seem not so absolutely different from\n\u201cyour\u201d projects. However one might regard the argument for\nimpersonal concern from such a view of the self, the view itself may\nseem to have a claim to our renewed attention. It certainly fits\nbetter with a naturalized conception of human beings as part of this\nworld and not as Cartesian thinking substances that somehow operate\napart from the rest of nature. Siderits (2003) Flanagan (2013) have\nbrought Buddhism into dialogue with naturalistic analytic philosophy\nin sophisticated and productive ways that benefit both sides.\n\nGoing back to the issue of the relative differences between Chinese\nand Western philosophy, it would be fair to say that the former is\nmore consistently focused on the question of how to live one\u2019s\nlife, even when the topic is the metaphysics of the world or of the\nself. This makes a difference to the way philosophy is done. As argued\nabove, Chinese philosophy has argumentation and the ambition to\nexplain through theory, but its commitment to the ethical and the\npractical in general has led to a tighter connection between\napproaches to how to live one\u2019s life and what it is to do\nphilosophy. Chinese philosophy is done in ways that have significantly\nnon- or extra-discursive dimensions. Jenco (2007) has pointed out that\neven when Western philosophers have discussed the ills of\nethnocentrism, they have typically framed their critiques in concepts\nand language from Western discourses, such as Marxism and\npoststructuralism. They have called for cross-cultural dialogue as a\nway of countering ethnocentrism without raising the question of\nwhether the exclusive use of dialogue itself might be a form of\nethnocentrism. Dialogue tends to focus our attention on texts and\nleaves out of focus practices such as memorization, recitation,\nmeditation, imitation, ritual, and dance (Jenco, 2007; Kalmonson,\n2017). It is not as if the texts are left out of one\u2019s\nattention. It is rather that these non-discursive practices become\npart of one\u2019s attempt to interpret and live the meaning of the\ntexts in one\u2019s personal experience. To fully engage in\ncross-cultural philosophy may require an openness to and\nexperimentation in these non-discursive practices. At a time when the\nboundaries between reason and emotion and body and mind are being\ncalled into question, and when the operations of reason and\ndecision-making have increasingly been found by cognitive psychology\nand science to depend on the state of the emotions and the body, it\nseems appropriate to consider that meditation and ritual practices may\nalter for the better the emotional and somatic basis of effective\nthinking and acting.\n",
