    "main_text": "Indexical Belief and Indexical Semantics || A Descriptivist Theory of Indexicals and Indexical Belief\n4.2 A Descriptivist Theory of Indexicals and Indexical Belief\n\n\nThe above objections resemble Frege\u2019s puzzles of cognitive\nsignificance for proper names. (See the entries on \n Gottlob Frege and\n propositional attitude reports.) \nOne traditional response to problems of cognitive significance for\nproper names is to adopt a descriptivist theory of proper\nnames.  There are parallel descriptivist theories of indexicals.\n\n\nOn some traditional descriptivist theories of proper names, the\ncontent of a proper name can be expressed by a purely\nqualitative definite description, which is a definite description\nthat does not contain any directly-referential terms (such as proper\nnames and indexicals, if these are directly-referential). For example,\non some views of this type, the content of the name \u2018Benjamin\nFranklin\u2019, in some speakers\u2019 idiolects, is the same as that\nof the definite description \u2018the person who invented\nbifocals\u2019.\n\n\nSimilarly, according to some descriptivist theories of indexicals,\nevery indexical, in every context, has a purely qualitative descriptive\ncontent. This content determines the indexical\u2019s referent with\nrespect to the world of the context (and any other world). A single\nindexical can have different descriptive contents in different\ncontexts, and so can have different referents in different contexts.\nThe descriptive content expressed by an indexical in a context is\ndetermined by the thoughts and intentions of the agent/speaker of the\ncontext. For example, when John utters \u2018he\u2019, he may mean\nthe man who is \\(F\\), where the property of being a man and\n\\(F\\) is a purely qualitative property that suffices to determine\na particular man independently of any context. The object determined by\nthis descriptive content is the object to which \u2018he\u2019\nrefers, with respect to John\u2019s context. If John utters \u2018He\nis making a mess\u2019, then the proposition that John believes and\nasserts is the proposition that the man who is \\(F\\) is making a\nmess.\n\n\nAn advocate of this purely qualitative descriptivist theory of\nindexicals could analyze the example of the messy shopper, in outline,\nas follows. When John first spots the messy shopper at\n\\(t_0\\), and utters \u2018He is making a mess\u2019,\nhe begins to believe the descriptive proposition that the man who is\n\\(F\\) is making a mess, where \\(F\\) is a purely qualitative\nproperty. Later, at \\(t_1\\), when John utters \u2018I\nam making a mess\u2019, he begins to believe that the man who is\n\\(G\\) is making a mess, where \\(G\\) is a purely qualitative\nproperty different from \\(F\\). Therefore, John begins to believe a\nproposition that he did not previously believe, contrary to what\ndirect-reference theories entail. Consider also the slightly modified\ncase in which John utters both \u2018He is making a mess\u2019 and\n\u2018I am not making a mess\u2019 when he first looks in\nthe mirror at \\(t_0\\). On a descriptivist analysis, John\nat that moment believes both the proposition that the man who is\n\\(F\\) is making a mess and the proposition that the man who is\n\\(G\\) is not making a mess. The second proposition is not\nthe negation of the first, so John is perfectly rational to believe\nboth. Thus the purely qualitative descriptivist theory seems to avoid\nthe above problems for direct reference theories.\n\n\nBut Hector-Neri Casta\u00f1eda (1966, 1967), John Perry (1977,\n1979), and Kaplan (1989a) have presented a number of compelling\nobjections to purely qualitative descriptivist theories. Versions of\nsome of these objections appear below.\n\n\nOn the above descriptivist theory, John contemplates a purely\nqualitative descriptive content when he utters \u2018He is making a\nmess\u2019. Yet if John were asked to whom he was referring with\n\u2018he\u2019, it is unlikely that he would respond with a purely\nqualitative definite description. Rather, he would probably respond\nwith a description like \u2018the man I see in that mirror\u2019,\nwhich is not purely qualitative unless John is contemplating purely\nqualitative properties when he utters \u2018I\u2019 and \u2018that\nmirror\u2019. Perhaps if John thought very hard, he could formulate a\npurely qualitative description that he thinks refers to the man he\nsees, such as the description \u2018the man wearing a green shirt, red\ntrousers, and white shoes who is pushing a shopping cart\u2019. But if\nhe has to think hard to find such a description, then he probably did\nnot entertain the content of that description when he first uttered\n\u2018He is making a mess\u2019.\n\n\nWaiving that objection, suppose that John does answer with a purely\nqualitative description, such as \u2018the man wearing a green shirt,\nred trousers, and white shoes who is pushing a shopping cart\u2019.\nStill, the description he uses may fail to refer to the person to whom\nJohn referred when he uttered \u2018he\u2019. Imagine that the mirror\nhas distorted the color of the trousers that John sees: the trousers he\nsees (namely, his own trousers) appear red to him in the mirror, but\nthey are in fact purple. So the preceding description does not pick out\nJohn. Now suppose further that there is a man who does fit the\ndescription perfectly, but he is in a grocery store far from John, and\nis not making a mess. Then the purely qualitative descriptivist theory\nentails that \u2018He is making a mess\u2019 is false in John\u2019s\ncontext. But the sentence John utters is true in his context, contrary\nto the theory.\n\n\nKaplan (1989a) gives modal arguments against purely qualitative\ndescriptivist theories of indexicals. Here is a modified version of one\nof his objections. Suppose, again, that the descriptive content of\n\u2018he\u2019 in John\u2019s context is the content of \u2018the\nman wearing a green shirt, red trousers, and white shoes who is pushing\na shopping cart\u2019. Then the following sentence expresses a\nnecessary truth in John\u2019s context: \u2018He is wearing a green\nshirt, if he exists\u2019. But that sentence expresses a contingent\ntruth, not a necessary truth, in John\u2019s context.\n",
