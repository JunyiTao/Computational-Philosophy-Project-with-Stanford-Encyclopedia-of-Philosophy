    "main_text": "Time\n10. Time\n\nAccording to Aristotle, motion and time are not the same but time\ncannot be isolated from motion, and. if we are not conscious of any\nchange, we are not aware of time. He tells of the men in the fable who\nslept with the heroes in Sardinia; when they awoke, to them no time\nseemed to have elapsed (Phys. IV.11, 218b21\u201325).\nAverroes read the story in the Arabic translation but he adapted it to\nthe Islamic context, and those men became the \u201cPeople of the\nCave\u201d mentioned in the Qur\u2019an 18:9\u201326 (LC 178B T97).\nHowever, the SC keeps the Aristotelian example (SC 58:\n10\u201311).\n\nMore significant is Averroes\u2019 interpretation of time as an\naccident of motion (Trifogli 2001, 62). Since motions are many, he\nwants to identify that motion the accident of which time is (LC 178G\nT98). If we assume that time is the accident of the celestial motion,\nthose who do not perceive this motion, \u201clike those of whom Plato\nsays that they have been incarcerated underground since their\nchildhood\u201d (Republic 7, 514a\u2013517a) will not\nperceive time at all. And if time is an accident of any motion, there\nwill be as many times as kinds of motion. Averroes solves the dilemma\nmaking a double interpretation of time. Our perception of time in so\nfar as we are beings undergoing change is the primary perception of\ntime, and\n\n\nit is evident that we only perceive that we are in a changing being\n(transmutabili, LC 179B) because of the change of the\nheavenly body.\n\n\nAnd he adds that if the heavenly body would be at rest, we would have\nthe nature of an unchanging being, in esse non transmutabili.\nThis perception follows time essentially, while our perception of time\nin relation to any motion otherwise is only accidental. Averroes\nadmits to have arrived at this opinion after long enquiry, post\nmagnum tempus, since in earlier times he followed the\ncommentators (LC 179G).\n\nTime is defined by Aristotle as the number of motion in respect of\nbefore and after (Phys. IV.11, 219b1\u20132). Averroes\nexpounds that \u2018number\u2019 is like the logical genus and\n\u2018before and after\u2019 the specific difference (LC 181F\nTC101). The definition was subject to discussion among Greek and Arab\ncommentators, and Averroes refers to Alexander of Aphrodisias and\nThemistius, and to al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b. For Averroes the\ndefinition of time about which there is no doubt is that \u201ctime\nis the numerable one of the before and after existing in motion\u201d\n(numeratum prioris et posterioris) (LC 181H TC101), that is,\nbefore and after is a condition existing in motion, and its\nnumerability is time. Averroes has the same explanation in his Short\nCommentary: \u201cWhen Aristotle says that time is the number of the\npreceding and the following he means that time is the numerable one\n(ma\u0559d\u016bd) of preceding and following that exists in\nmotion\u201d (SC 61: 12).\n\nBecause time numbers and measures, it is similar to the numbers we use\nin counting (assimilatur, LC 182B TC102). When Aristotle\nlater says that motion and time number and measure each other\n(Phys. IV.12, 220b14\u201332), Averroes gives his view: time\nnumbers and measures motion essentially (per se) and it is\nnumbered and measured by motion accidentally \u201cbecause the\nsubstance of time is number of motion\u201d (LC 188D TC112). By\nemploying the term substantia to time several times Averroes\nshows that he sees time as a certain entity in itself.\n\nTime measures also things that are at rest because they exist in time\n(221b8\u20139). The Arabic translation does not insert\n\u201cincidentally\u201d to restrict \u201cmeasures\u201d\n(\u1e6cab\u012b\u02bba [1964: 456: 4\u20135]). In his\ncommentary (LC 192F TC118; MC Wolfson 647), Averroes shows first his\nconcern for things that are eternally in motion like the universe and\nthings that are eternally at rest like the earth: he says that they\ncannot be measured by time (LC 192L). Therefore, time measures motion\nand rest; it measures motion essentially and primarily, and it\nmeasures rest incidentally and secondarily, i.e., \u201cas it is\ndeprivation of motion\u201d (LC 193L); the solution fits in with\nAverroes\u2019 way of thinking.\n\nShould we look at the processes of coming-to-be and passing-away we\nmeet with similar interpretation. The elements change one into\nanother; water exists for a while and then turns into air, for\ninstance. In particular, individual living beings have a limited life\nspan; thus a linear dimension extends to them while the whole\nundergoes a continuous cycle of coming-to-be and passing-away, and its\ndimension is circular. Time measures the limited duration of sublunary\nbeings, and the eternal motion of the spheres makes cycles eternal. To\nlink both dimensions, Averroes introduces the motion of the sun along\nthe ecliptic, the inclined circle that marks the sun\u2019s\n path.[9]\n\n\nFor this circle, as Aristotle says, in addition to the continuity and\nperpetuity of the motion in it, has the added feature of possessing a\nduality of movements, one of approach and one of retreat.
