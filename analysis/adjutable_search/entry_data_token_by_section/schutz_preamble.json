    "main_text": "\n\nAlfred Schutz (b. 1899, d. 1959), more than any other phenomenologist,\nattempted to relate the thought of Edmund Husserl to the social world\nand the social sciences. His Phenomenology of the Social\nWorld supplied philosophical foundations for Max Weber\u2019s\nsociology and for economics, with which he was familiar through\ncontacts with colleagues of the Austrian school. When Schutz fled\nHitler\u2019s Anschluss of Austria and immigrated to the\nUnited States in 1939, he developed his thought further in\nrelationship to the social sciences, American pragmatism, logical\nempiricism, and to various other fields of endeavor such as music and\nliterature. His work has been influential on new movements in\nsociological thought such as ethnomethodology and conversation\nanalysis.\n",
