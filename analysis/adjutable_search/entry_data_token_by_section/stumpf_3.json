    "main_text": "The Classification of Sciences\n4. The Classification of Sciences\n\nThe starting point of Stumpf\u2019s classification is the cardinal\ndistinction made in Brentano\u2019s Psychology from an\nEmpirical Standpoint between two classes of phenomena, physical\nphenomena and mental phenomena, or what Stumpf calls sensory phenomena\nand psychical functions. (R. Rollinger, 2008b) The domain of psychical\nfunctions, to which internal perception gives access, belongs to\ndescriptive psychology which constitutes the foundation of one of the\ntwo branches of Stumpf\u2019s classification of sciences, namely the\nhuman sciences (Geisteswissenschaften). Human sciences such\nas aesthetics and ethics, are closely related to the major classes of\nthe simple functions such as the class of emotions in ethics, for\ninstance, and are defined as the sciences of complex functions.\n(Stumpf, 1906a, p. 21) The other branch is that of the natural\nsciences and it is based on physics. In the perspective of\nStumpf\u2019s Erfahrungsphilosophie, physics takes as its\nstarting point the phenomena of external perception, and its task is\nto explain the regularity of phenomena by using the laws of physics.\nBut Stumpf is not a phenomenalist as he advocates instead a form of\ncritical realism that he conceives as the antithesis of phenomenalism\nsuch as that which he attributes to classical empiricism and to E.\nMach. Nevertheless, Stumpf agrees with the latter that all concepts,\nincluding the concept of causality, originate from the contents of\nsensory experience and are the result of a process of abstraction.\nHowever, Stumpf clearly distinguishes the question of the origins of\nconcepts, belonging to descriptive psychology, from the question of\nthe origins and justification of knowledge, which falls within the\ntheory of knowledge. This distinction is at the heart of his\nhabilitation thesis and we shall have the opportunity to return to\nthis important issue.\n\nFrom these two main classes, Stumpf distinguished within his\nclassification three neutral sciences whose task is to study the\nstructure of the contents of psychical functions and sense phenomena\nin general. Stumpf claims that they represent three different fields\nof research, corresponding to three distinct sciences: phenomenology\nas the science of phenomena, eidology which studies formations, and\nthe general theory of relations understood as the science of relations\nas a whole. These three new sciences are said to be\n\u201cneutral\u201d with regard to existing sciences and they are\n\u201cpropaedeutic sciences\u201d in that their field of study\nrepresents the raw material and the starting point of the natural\nsciences as well as the social sciences. To use Stumpf\u2019s terms,\nthey are the atrium and the organon of all sciences\nand of philosophy.\n\nWhat he calls phenomenology in his two Academy treatises of 1906 is a\nfield of study to which he dedicated many works, from his early work\non the origins of space perception up to his 1926 book on vowels and\nphonetics. The field of phenomenology in Stumpf\u2019s sense is\nlimited to phenomena and their properties and is defined narrowly as\nthe science of phenomena. The study of formations and of objects of\nthought in general belongs to the second neutral science which Stumpf\ncalls \u201ceidology,\u201d an expression that he borrowed from\nHerbart. Stumpf first introduced the notion of formation\n(Gebilde) in 1902 in order to characterize the specific\ncontents of functions or what he also calls the objective correlates\nof a psychical function. Formations are contents that enter into\nconsciousness through carrying out specific functions in the sense\nthat to every class and subclass of acts there corresponds a certain\ncontent specific to each and every act. All psychical functions, from\nthe simplest to the most complex, have their specific contents:\nconcepts, states of affairs and values, to name only the most\nimportant. For example the act of abstraction, which is responsible\nfor the formation of concepts, notably the concept of space, has a\nconcept as its own specific content. States of affairs are contents of\njudgment, and they are comparable to Meinong\u2019s\n\u201cobjectives\u201d, Husserl\u2019s \u201cobjectivity\u201d or\nto Bolzano\u2019s \u201cproposition in itself\u201d; they play a\ncentral role in Stumpf\u2019s logic as we shall see later. (G.\nFr\u00e9chette, 2015; A. Chrudzimski, 2015) These are\n\u201ccorrelates\u201d of thought and, in contrast to individual\nacts, they have an objective character. The objectivity of formations,\nhowever, is not to be understood in terms of intentional inexistence\n(Brentano) or in the sense of Platonic realism (Bolzano and Frege),\nbecause any formation is logically dependent of the act that produces\nit, and the existence of states of affairs is logically linked to that\nof the act of judgment. They are therefore abstracted in the sense\nthat they cannot exist independently from the acts by which\nthey are produced. The same rule can be found in the field of more\ncomplex functions such as emotions, desires, and voluntary actions,\nwhose specific contents are values. The very possibility of a neutral\nscience such as eidology shows that we can study values in themselves,\nindependently of any function; yet Stumpf claims that it is not\npossible to dissociate formations from their original functions.\n\nRelations form the group of objects whose study belongs to the general\ntheory of relations. This theory represents an important part of logic\nand formal ontology, and its task in fact lies in the study of the\nlaws governing the formal relations between objects and parts of\nobjects. This aspect of the general theory of relations is comparable\nto Husserl\u2019s pure logic. The relations of structure between\npsychical functions and the hierarchy within the domain of simple and\ncomplex functions obey what Stumpf refers to as the \u201claws of\nstructure\u201d between parts or aspects of a whole. Its task is to\nestablish relations between phenomena, functions, and formations and\nto investigate the origins of complex relations in simple relations,\nfixed by means of definition, and to determine the structural laws to\nwhich they obey. To these Grundverh\u00e4lnisse or\nfundamental relations belong, namely, the concepts of analogy,\nequality and fusion that Stumpf examines succinctly in the second\nvolume of Tonpsychologie, as being the relations of logical\nand real dependency, the part-whole relations as well as the relations\nof real dependency between psychical functions. These relations are\nimmanent to phenomena and are noticeable directly and without\nintermediary. Sensory contents are noticed or remarked in themselves,\nand each of these relations is, to again use the Scholastic\nexpression, an ens rationis cum fundamento in re. The notion\nof fusion designates one of the forms of relations that structure the\nsensory material. It is defined as the relation between two phenomena\n(or contents of sensation) by virtue of which they do not merely form\na sum, but a whole. Stumpf argues that the elements which fuse into\nthe whole, for example quality and intensity of sounds in a melody,\nare not changed, but this relation of fusion establishes between these\ncontents a narrower unity which is perceptible as a Gestalt. To use\nthe well-known case of the melody, moments of quality and of intensity\nform in that case a unitary whole which is perceptible as a\n\u201cquality of form,\u201d and it is precisely the unitary\ncharacter of this perception, the fact that it is perceptible in one\nstroke and immediately as unitary form, that Stumpf tries to account\nfor with the aid of the notion of relation of fusion.\n",
