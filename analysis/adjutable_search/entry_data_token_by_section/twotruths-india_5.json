    "main_text": "Sautr\u0101ntika || Conventional truth\n2.2 Conventional truth\n\nDharmak\u012brti defines conventional truth, in his [PVK], as dharma\nwhich is \u201cconventionally existent\u201d and he identifies\nconventional truth with the \u201cuniversal\u201d\n (s\u0101m\u0101nya-lak\u1e63a\u1e47a)[7]\n just as he identifies ultimate truth with unique particular\n(Tshad ma ce 118b). When a Sautr\u0101ntika philosopher\ndescribes a certain entity as a universal, he means a conceptual\nentity not apprehended by virtue of its own being. He means a general\nproperty that is conceptually constructed, appearing to be something\ncommon amongst all items in a certain class of objects. Unlike\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika view where universals are regarded as\nobjectively real and eternal entities inhering in substances,\nqualities and particulars, universals, for the Sautr\u0101ntika are\npure conceptual constructs. Sautr\u0101ntika holds the view known as\nnominalism or conceptualism\u2014the view that denies universals any\nindependent extramental objective reality existing on their own apart\nfrom being mentally constructed.\n\nWhile unique particulars exist independently of linguistic convention,\nuniversals have no reality in isolation from linguistic and conceptual\nconventions. Thus, universals and ultimate reality are mutually\nexclusive. Universals are therefore only conventionally real, lacking\nany intrinsic nature, whereas unique particulars are ultimately real,\nand exist intrinsically.\n\nThe Sautr\u0101ntika defends the claim that universals\n(s\u0101m\u0101nya-lak\u1e63a\u1e47a) are only conventional reality\nfor the following reasons (tshad ma ce 118b):\n\nUniversals are domains of inferential cognition since they are\nexhaustively grasped by conceptual mind by means of language and\nthought (Dharmak\u012brti, Ny\u0101yabindu, tshad ma\nce 231a).\nUniversals are objects of the apprehending cognition which arises\nsimply out of having beliefs about the objects without the need to see\nany real object.\nUniversals are causally inefficient. By \u201ccausal\ninefficiency,\u201d the Sautr\u0101ntika, according to Dharmottara\u2019s\nNy\u0101yabindu\u1e6d\u012bk\u0101, (Tshad ma we\n45ab) means three things: (a) universals are purely conceptually\nconstructed, hence unreal; (b) universals are unable to serve a\npragmatic purpose as they do not fulfil life\u2019s objectives; and (c)\ncognitive images produced by universals are independent of the\nproximity between objects and their cognitions since production of\nimage does not require seeing the object as it is in the case of\nperception and unique particulars.\nUniversals are products of unifying or mixing of language and\ntheir referential objects (unique particulars), and thus appearing\nthem to conceptual minds as generalities, unified wholes, unity,\ncontinuity, as phenomena that appear to conceptual mind to having\nshared properties linking with all items in the same class of\nobjects.\nUniversals, consequently, obscure the individualities of unique\nparticulars from being directly apprehended. This is because, as we\nhave already seen, universals, according to Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s [PVK]\n(Tshad ma ce 97ab) and [PVT] (Tshad ma ce 282ab),\nare only conventionally real since they are conceptual constructs\nfounded on unifying and putting together the distinct individualities\nof unique particulars as having one common property being shared by\nall items in the same class.\n\n\nAccording to the Sautr\u0101ntika philosophy, language does not\ndescribe reality or unique particulars positively through real\nuniversals as suggested by the Naiy\u0101yikas. The Sautr\u0101ntika\ndeveloped an alternative nominalist theory of universal called the\napoha-theory in which language is seen to engage with reality\nnegatively by means of elimination or exclusion of the other\n(any\u0101poha / gzhan sel). On this theory, the function of language,\nspecifically naming, is to eliminate object from the class of\nthose objects to which language does not apply.\n\nIn brief the Sautr\u0101ntika\u2019s theory of the two truths rests on\ndichotomising objects between unique particulars, which are understood\nas ultimately reals, dynamic, momentary, causally effective, the\nobjective domain of the direct perception; and universals, which are\nunderstood as only conventionally reals, conceptually constructed,\nstatic, causally ineffective and the objective domain of the\ninferential cognition.\n",
