    "main_text": "Political Obligation in Historical Perspective || Socrates on Obeying the Law\n1.1 Socrates on Obeying the Law\n\nIn 399 BCE an Athenian jury found Socrates guilty of impiety and\ncorrupting the morals of the youth, for which crimes the jury\ncondemned him to death. According to Plato\u2019s account, Socrates\u2019\nfriends arranged his escape, but he chose to stay and drink the fatal\nhemlock, arguing that to defy the judgment against him would be to\nbreak his \u201cagreements and commitments\u201d and to\n\u201cmistreat\u201d his friends, his country, and the laws of\nAthens (Crito, 54c; Trial and Death, p. 54).\nSocrates\u2019 arguments are sketchy, and Crito, his interlocutor, does\nlittle to challenge them, but they are nevertheless suggestive of the\ntheories of political obligation that have emerged in the two and a\nhalf millennia since his death.\n\nThese arguments fall into at least four categories. First, Socrates\nmaintains that his long residence in Athens shows that he has entered\ninto an agreement with its laws and committed himself to obey them\n\u2013 an argument that anticipates the social contract or consent\ntheory of political obligation. Second, he acknowledges that he owes\nhis birth, nurture, and education, among other goods, to the laws of\nAthens. Together with the explicit analogy he draws between a\nfather\u2019s rightful claim to his children\u2019s obedience and\nAthens\u2019 rightful claim to her citizens\u2019 obedience, these\nobservations point toward a membership or associative account of\npolitical obligation. Third, Socrates appeals to what is now known as\nthe argument from fairness or fair play when he suggests that to\ndisregard his legal sentence would be to free-ride on his fellow\ncitizens, enjoying the benefits provided by their complying with the\nlaw while refusing to bear the cost of doing so himself. As he asks\nCrito, \u201cif we leave here without the city\u2019s permission,\nare we mistreating people whom we should least mistreat?\u201d (50a)\nFinally, there is a trace of utilitarian reasoning when Socrates\nimagines \u201cthe laws and the state\u201d confronting him with\nthis challenge: \u201cdo you think it possible for a city not to be\ndestroyed if the verdicts of its courts have no force but are\nnullified and set at naught by private individuals?\u201d (50b) None\nof these arguments is fully developed, but their presence in the\nCrito testifies to the staying power of intuitions and\nconcepts \u2013 commitment and agreement, gratitude, fair play, and\nutility \u2013 that continue to figure in discussions of obligation\nand obedience.\n\nPlato\u2019s Crito is noteworthy not only as the first\nphilosophical exploration of political obligation but also as the last\nto appear for centuries. To be sure, the Cynics and others did\nquestion the value of political life, and indirectly the existence of\nan obligation to obey the law, but they left no record of a discussion\nof the subject as sustained as even the five or six pages in the\nCrito. When the morality of obedience and disobedience next\nbecame a much discussed issue, it was a religious as much as a\nphilosophical discussion.\n",
