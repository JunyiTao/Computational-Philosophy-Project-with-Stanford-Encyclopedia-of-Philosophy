    "main_text": "Alliance with Bentham\n2. Alliance with Bentham\nIn late 1807 or early 1808 James Mill met Jeremy Bentham, with whom he soon formed a political and philosophical alliance. The two were in some respects kindred spirits. Both wished and worked for religious toleration and legal reform; both favored freedom of speech and press; both feared that the failure to reform the British political system\u2014by, among other things, eliminating rotten boroughs and extending the franchise\u2014would give rise to reactionary intransigence on the one hand, and revolutionary excess on the other. But the two men were of vastly different temperaments and backgrounds. Bentham, a wealthy bachelor, was an eccentric genius and closet philosopher. The poor, harried and hard-working Mill was the more practical and worldly partner in that peculiar partnership. He was also a much clearer writer and more persuasive propagandist for the Utilitarian cause.\nBentham believed that the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain were the twin aims of all human action. His philosophy, Utilitarianism, held that self-interest\u2014understood as pleasure or happiness\u2014should be \u201cmaximized\u201d and pain \u201cminimized\u201d (Bentham, incidentally, coined both terms). And, as with individual self-interest, so too with the public interest. According to Bentham, the aim of legislation and public policy was to promote \u201cthe greatest happiness of the greatest number.\u201d Mill agreed, after a fashion. Formerly a dour Scots Presbyterian and still something of a Platonist, he took a dim view of unalloyed hedonism. Like Plato, he ranked the pleasures in a hierarchy, with the sensual pleasures subordinated to the intellectual ones.\nDespite their differences, Mill proved to be Bentham\u2019s most valuable ally. A better writer and abler advocate, Mill helped to make Bentham\u2019s ideas and schemes more palatable and popular than they might otherwise have been. But he also influenced Bentham\u2019s ideas in a number of ways. For one, Mill led Bentham to appreciate the importance of economic factors in explaining and changing social life and political institutions; for another, he turned Bentham away from advocating aristocratic \u201ctop-down\u201d reform into a more popular or \u201cdemocratic\u201d direction. For a time their partnership proved fruitful. With Mill\u2019s energy and Bentham\u2019s ideas and financial backing, Utilitarian schemes for legal, political, penal, and educational reform gained an ever wider audience and circle of adherents. This circle included, among others, Francis Place (\u201cthe radical tailor of Charing Cross\u201d), the Genevan Etienne Dumont, the historian George Grote, the stockbroker-turned-economist David Ricardo, and\u2014certainly not least\u2014the young John Stuart Mill. Each in his own way enlisted in the Utilitarian cause. The cause was furthered by the founding of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge and, later, by the launching of the Westminster Review and the founding of University College London (where Bentham\u2019s body, stuffed and mounted in a glass case, can still be seen today). This small band of \u201cphilosophic radicals\u201d worked tirelessly for political changes, several of which were later incorporated into the Reform Act of 1832. But Bentham and Mill became increasingly estranged. Bentham was irascible and difficult to work with, and Mill on more than one occasion swallowed his pride by accepting financial support and suffering personal rebuke from his senior partner.\nIn 1818, after twelve years\u2019 work, Mill\u2019s massive History of British India was published. Early in the following year he was appointed Assistant Examiner at the East India Company. His financial future finally secured, Mill no longer needed Bentham\u2019s largesse. The two men saw less and less of each other. Their political alliance continued even as their personal relationship cooled. Their uneasy friendship effectively ended some years before Bentham\u2019s death in 1832.\nBesides being a tireless reformer and prolific writer, James Mill supplied his son John with one of the most strenuous educations ever recorded in the annals of pedagogy. The elder Mill gave young John daily lessons in Latin, Greek, French, history, philosophy, and political economy. Literature and poetry were also taught, although with less enthusiasm (James Mill, like Plato, distrusted poets and poetry). John was in turn expected to tutor his younger brothers and sisters in these subjects. Each was examined rigorously and regularly by their unforgiving father, and the nine children, like their mother, lived with in fear of his rebuke. As John Stuart Mill later wrote, \u201cI \u2026 grew up in the absence of love and in the presence of fear\u201d (J.S. Mill 1873, 612).\nMill\u2019s strained relations with his wife and children stand in stark contrast with his warm and cordial relations with others, and most especially the young men who sought him out for the pleasure of his company and the vigor of his conversation. As John Black, the editor of the Morning Chronicle, recalled on the occasion of Mill\u2019s death in 1836:\nMr. Mill was eloquent and impressive in conversation. He had a great command of language, which bore the stamp of his earnest and energetic character. Young men were particularly fond of his society \u2026 No man could enjoy his society without catching a portion of his elevated enthusiasm \u2026 His conversation was so energetic and complete in thought, so succinct, and exact \u2026 in expression, that, if reported as uttered, his colloquial observations or arguments would have been perfect compositions (quoted in Bain 1882, 457).\nUnfortunately the same cannot be said of Mill\u2019s writings, which tend to be both dry and didactic.\n",
