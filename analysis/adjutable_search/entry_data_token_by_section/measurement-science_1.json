Quantity and Magnitude: A Brief History\n\nAlthough the philosophy of measurement formed as a distinct area of\ninquiry only during the second half of the nineteenth century,\nfundamental concepts of measurement such as magnitude and quantity\nhave been discussed since antiquity. According to Euclid\u2019s\nElements, a magnitude\u2014such as a line, a surface or a\nsolid\u2014measures another when the latter is a whole multiple of\nthe former (Book V, def. 1 & 2). Two magnitudes have a common\nmeasure when they are both whole multiples of some magnitude, and are\nincommensurable otherwise (Book X, def. 1). The discovery of\nincommensurable magnitudes allowed Euclid and his contemporaries to\ndevelop the notion of a ratio of magnitudes. Ratios can be\neither rational or irrational, and therefore the concept of ratio is\nmore general than that of measure (Michell 2003, 2004a;\nGrattan-Guinness 1996).\n\nAristotle distinguished between quantities and qualities. Examples of\nquantities are numbers, lines, surfaces, bodies, time and place,\nwhereas examples of qualities are justice, health, hotness and\npaleness (Categories \u00a76 and \u00a78). According to\nAristotle, quantities admit of equality and inequality but not of\ndegrees, as \u201cone thing is not more four-foot than another\u201d\n(ibid. 6.6a19). Qualities, conversely, do not admit of equality or\ninequality but do admit of degrees, \u201cfor one thing is called\nmore pale or less pale than another\u201d (ibid. 8.10b26). Aristotle\ndid not clearly specify whether degrees of qualities such as paleness\ncorrespond to distinct qualities, or whether the same quality,\npaleness, was capable of different intensities. This topic was at the\ncenter of an ongoing debate in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries\n(Jung 2011). Duns Scotus supported the \u201caddition theory\u201d,\naccording to which a change in the degree of a quality can be\nexplained by the addition or subtraction of smaller degrees of that\nquality (2011: 553). This theory was later refined by Nicole Oresme,\nwho used geometrical figures to represent changes in the intensity of\nqualities such as velocity (Clagett 1968; Sylla 1971). Oresme\u2019s\ngeometrical representations established a subset of qualities that\nwere amenable to quantitative treatment, thereby challenging the\nstrict Aristotelian dichotomy between quantities and qualities. These\ndevelopments made possible the formulation of quantitative laws of\nmotion during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries (Grant\n1996).\n\nThe concept of qualitative intensity was further developed by Leibniz\nand Kant. Leibniz\u2019s \u201cprinciple of continuity\u201d stated\nthat all natural change is produced by degrees. Leibniz argued that\nthis principle applies not only to changes in extended magnitudes such\nas length and duration, but also to intensities of representational\nstates of consciousness, such as sounds (Jorgensen 2009; Diehl 2012).\nKant is thought to have relied on Leibniz\u2019s principle of\ncontinuity to formulate his distinction between extensive and\nintensive magnitudes. According to Kant, extensive magnitudes are\nthose \u201cin which the representation of the parts makes possible\nthe representation of the whole\u201d (1787: A162/B203). An example\nis length: a line can only be mentally represented by a successive\nsynthesis in which parts of the line join to form the whole. For Kant,\nthe possibility of such synthesis was grounded in the forms of\nintuition, namely space and time. Intensive magnitudes, like warmth or\ncolors, also come in continuous degrees, but their apprehension takes\nplace in an instant rather than through a successive synthesis of\nparts. The degrees of intensive magnitudes \u201ccan only be\nrepresented through approximation to negation\u201d (1787: A\n168/B210), that is, by imagining their gradual diminution until their\ncomplete absence.\n\nScientific developments during the nineteenth century challenged the\ndistinction between extensive and intensive magnitudes. Thermodynamics\nand wave optics showed that differences in temperature and hue\ncorresponded to differences in spatio-temporal magnitudes such as\nvelocity and wavelength. Electrical magnitudes such as resistance and\nconductance were shown to be capable of addition and division despite\nnot being extensive in the Kantian sense, i.e., not synthesized from\nspatial or temporal parts. Moreover, early experiments in\npsychophysics suggested that intensities of sensation such as\nbrightness and loudness could be represented as sums of \u201cjust\nnoticeable differences\u201d among stimuli, and could therefore be\nthought of as composed of parts (see\n Section 3.3).\n These findings, along with advances in the axiomatization of branches\nof mathematics, motivated some of the leading scientists of the late\nnineteenth century to attempt to clarify the mathematical foundations\nof measurement (Maxwell 1873; von Kries 1882; Helmholtz 1887; Mach\n1896; Poincar\u00e9 1898; H\u00f6lder 1901; for historical surveys\nsee Darrigol 2003; Michell 1993, 2003; Cant\u00f9 and Schlaudt 2013;\nBiagioli 2016: Ch. 4, 2018). These works are viewed today as\nprecursors to the body of scholarship known as \u201cmeasurement\ntheory\u201d.\n",
