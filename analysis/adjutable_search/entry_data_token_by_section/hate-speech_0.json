It also functions as\nan evaluative term judging its referent negatively and as a candidate\nfor censure. Thus, defining this category carries serious\nimplications. What is it that designates hate speech as a distinctive\nclass of speech? Some claim the term \u2018hate speech\u2019 itself\nis misleading because it wrongly suggests \u201cvirulent dislike of a\nperson for any reason\u201d as a defining feature (Gelber 2017, 619).\nThat is not, however, the way in which the term is understood among\nmost legal theorists and philosophers. Perhaps it would be useful to\nstart with some examples.\n\nBhikhu Parekh (2012) lists the following instances as examples\ndifferent countries have either punished or sought to punish as hate\nspeech:\n\nShouting \u201c[N-words] go home,\u201d making monkey noises,\nand chanting racist slogans at soccer matches.\n\u201cIslam out of Britain. Protect the British\npeople.\u201d\n\u201cArabs out of France.\u201d\n\u201cServe your country, burn down a mosque.\u201d\n\u201cBlacks are inherently inferior, lecherous, predisposed to\ncriminal activities, and should not be allowed to move into\nrespectable areas.\u201d\n\u201cJews are conspiratorial, devious, treacherous, sadistic,\nchild killers, and subversive; want to take over the country; and\nshould be carefully watched.\u201d\nDistribution by a political party of leaflets addressed to\n\u201cwhite fellow citizens\u201d saying that, if it came to power,\nit would remove all Surinamese, Turks, and other \u201cundesired\naliens\u201d from the Netherlands.\nA poster of a woman in a burka with text that reads:\n\u201cWho knows what they have under their sinister and ugly looking\nclothes: stolen goods, guns, bombs even?\u201d\nSpeech that either denies or trivializes the holocaust or other\ncrimes against humanity.\n\n\nRobert Post\u2019s four bases for defining hate speech might help us\norganize the features of Parekh\u2019s list:\n\nIn law, we have to define hate speech carefully to designate the forms\nof the speech that will receive distinctive legal treatment. This is\nno easy task. Roughly speaking, we can define hate speech in terms of\nthe harms it will cause\u2014physical contingent harms like violence\nor discrimination; or we can define hate speech in terms of its\nintrinsic properties\u2014the kinds of words it uses; or we can\ndefine hate speech in terms of its connection to principles of\ndignity; or we can define hate speech in terms of the ideas it\nconveys. Each of these definitions has advantages and disadvantages.\nEach intersects with the first amendment theory in a different way. In\nthe end, any definition that we adopt must be justified on the ground\nthat it will achieve the results we wish to achieve. (Herz and Molnar\n2012, 31)\n\n\nThe four definitional bases are in terms of: (1) harm, (2) content,\n(3) intrinsic properties, i.e., the type of words used, and (4)\ndignity. One could also attempt a hybrid definition by combining the\nways mentioned. But, as is made clear in Post\u2019s remarks,\ndefinitions of this sort are relative to the interests of the definer;\n\u201cWe must evaluate the status of \u2018hate speech\u2019 so\ndefined in order to determine whether it achieves what we wish to\naccomplish and whether the harms of the definition will outweigh its\nadvantages\u201d (Herz and Molnar 2012, 31). The upshot is a\nrejection of a univocal definition that captures \u201cthe\nessence\u201d of hate speech as a phenomenon.\n\nIt is important to note that many definitions of hate speech will not\nfall squarely within the categories Post outlines. For instance, the\nUN\u2019s International Convention on the Elimination of All\nForms of Racial Discrimination identifies hate speech both in\nterms of its content and its harmful consequences. Most definitions\ntend to characterize hate speech in multiple ways.\n\nHarm-based definitions conceive of hate speech in terms of the harms\nto which targets are subjected. Things like discrimination or\nlinguistic violence are candidates, though some (Gelber, 2017) argue\nthat hate speech can harm one\u2019s ability to participate in\ndemocratic deliberation. Susan Brison (1998a) offers a disjunctive\ndefinition that centers on a kind of abuse to targets. She defines\nhate speech as \u201cspeech that vilifies individuals or groups on\nthe basis of such characteristics as race, sex, ethnicity, religion,\nand sexual orientation, which (1) constitutes face-to-face\nvilification, (2) creates a hostile or intimidating environment, or\n(3) is a kind of group libel\u201d (313). \u2018Harm\u2019 as used\nby Brison refers to what Joel Feinberg describes \u201cas a wrongful\nsetback to (or invasion of) someone\u2019s interests\u201d (Brison,\n1998b, 42).\n\nPerhaps an immediate reaction to disjunctive definitions of the sort\nBrison offers is skepticism about the definitiveness of the purported\nlist. When we go to test the definition\u2019s application, we\ninvariably find contestable inclusions and exclusions. Recall the\nexamples from Parekh at the start of this section. Something like\n\u201cArabs out of France\u201d might be included as an instance of\nhate speech on Brison\u2019s account on the grounds that it creates a\nhostile or intimidating environment. Should statements that\ncommunicate a similar message in a less abrasive manner also be\nincluded? Suppose \u201cOnly French Nationals should occupy\nFrance\u201d is roughly equivalent content-wise to \u201cArabs out\nof France.\u201d If the former is indeed a less abrasive presentation\nthough communicating the same content as the latter, what are we to\nmake of its status? Many will find the statement odious; many will\nnot. And since it is certainly not a face-to-face vilification or form\nof group libel, classifying it as hate speech will depend on how\nlikely it is to create an intimidating or hostile environment.\n\nThe previous objection might entice one to opt for a content-based\nview. Content-based views define hate speech as that which\n\u201cexpresses, encourages, stirs up, or incites hatred\nagainst a group of individuals distinguished by a particular feature\nor set of features such as race, ethnicity, gender, religion,\nnationality, and sexual orientation\u201d (Parekh, 2012, 40). This\nversion makes it easier to conceive of semantically equivalent\nstatements that differ in manner of presentation as instances of hate\nspeech.\n\nContent-based accounts face the challenge of determining which\ncontents meet this standard. If the content that distinguishes hate\nspeech from other types of speech must express, encourage, or incite\nhatred towards groups or individuals based on certain features, then\nthe proponent of this view will need an account of expression. Is the\nspeech in view that which signals the presence of a particular mental\nstate in the speaker (i.e., hate) or that which is likely to prime\nfeelings of animosity in a specific audience?\n\nAnother issue facing content-based approaches concerns distinguishing\nbetween speech that \u201crespects \u2018the decencies of\ncontroversy\u2019\u201d and that \u201cwhich is outrageous and\ntherefore hate inducing\u201d (Post, 2009, 128). The ability to\nexpress a wide range of views, even contentious ones, is a cherished\naspect of democratic societies. Failure to observe this distinction\nwould broaden the scope of what counts as hate speech perhaps too\nmuch. In order to make this distinction, one could follow Post in\ntying it to \u201cambient social norms\u201d that distinguish\noutrageous and respectful behavior. One challenge though is in\ndetermining the content of those social norms. For instance, a\nminority group whose opinions have little impact on the makeup of\nnorms are unjustifiably excluded from influencing the shape of their\nsociety\u2019s civility norms.\n\nDefinitions of hate speech based on intrinsic properties generally\nrefer to those that emphasize the type of the speech uttered. What is\nat issue is the use of speech widely known to instigate offense or\ninsult among a majority of society. Explicitly derogatory expressions\nlike slurs are paradigmatic examples of this type of view. In general,\nthe type of speech identified on this account is inherently\nderogatory, discriminatory, or vilifying.\n\nThough attractive at first glance, classifying hate speech along these\nlines might prove to fall short in two ways. First, defining hate\nspeech in this way might be too constricting. Some of the examples in\nour initial list would seem not to count as hate speech since they\narguably lack the intrinsic features. \u201cArabs out of\nFrance,\u201d for example, does not contain explicitly slurring\nterms. And second, this definition might prove too expansive. In cases\nwhere slurs are reappropriated by members of the target group or where\nartists incorporate them into a creative work, it would appear odd to\ncount these as instances of hate speech. The concern is tied\nspecifically to locating the issue in the terms themselves, as opposed\nto the use to which the terms are put.\n\nPerhaps a final challenge to intrinsic property views can be derived\nfrom the work of Judith Butler (1997). On Butler\u2019s account, hate\nspeech is a kind of performative that is \u201calways delivered\ntwice-removed, that is, through a theory of the speech act\nthat has its own performative power\u201d (96). More specifically,\n\u201c[w]hat hate speech does \u2026 is to constitute the subject\nin a subordinate position\u201d (19). Butler locates the trouble with\nhate speech in its perlocutionary effects, a concept\nintroduced by J.L. Austin that refers to the effects a speech act can\nhave on its audience. An example of a perlocutionary effect is feeling\namused at a joke or frightened from the telling of a ghost story.\nUnlike with intrinsic property definitions, Butler shifts focus to the\nnature of the acts performed rather than the terms in use. (For a\ncritical look at Butler\u2019s account, see Schwartzman (2002).)\n\nLastly, dignity-based conceptions focus primarily on the role of harms\nto the dignity of targets of hate speech. For instance, both Steven\nHeyman (2008) and Jeremy Waldron (2014) appeal to dignity in their\naccounts. Broadly speaking, hate speech on this kind of conception\namounts to speech that undermines its target\u2019s \u201cbasic\nsocial standing, the basis of [their] recognition as social equals and\nas bearers of human rights and constitutional entitlements\u201d\n(Waldron, 2014, 59). This conception of hate speech will also include\ncharacterizations in terms of group defamation or group libel. Section\n130 of Germany\u2019s penal code is an example of legislation that\nincorporates a dignity-based conception of hate speech, prohibiting\n\u201cattacks on human dignity by insulting, maliciously maligning,\nor defaming part of the population\u201d (see Waldron, 2014,\n8).\n\nWorries about application follow dignity-based conceptions as well.\nFirstly, there may be questions about how we, in particular instances,\nare to distinguish between false statements about a group as a whole\nand those about a particular member of a group (Brown, 2017a).\nPresumably, only the former is consistent with an understanding of\nhate speech as a group-based phenomenon. Secondly, an implication of\nthe view appears to be that it expands the range of things that would\ncount as hate speech. Any speech that calls into question the basic\nstanding of certain groups falls under this notion, which may make it\nmore difficult to distinguish between contentious political speech and\nhate speech.\n\nPerhaps a lesson to draw from the profusion of disjunctive definitions\nis a general skepticism about a definitive description of hate speech.\nWe might concur with Alexander Brown that \u2018hate speech\u2019 is\nan equivocal term denoting a family of meanings (Brown 2017b, 562).\nAccording to Brown, \u2018hate speech\u2019 isn\u2019t just a term\nwith contested meanings, but rather, it is \u201csystematically\nambiguous; which is to say, it carries a multiplicity of different\nmeanings\u201d (2017b, 564). Because the expression is what is\ntypically referred to as an essentially contested term, the hunt for a\nunivocal or universal definition is futile.\n",
