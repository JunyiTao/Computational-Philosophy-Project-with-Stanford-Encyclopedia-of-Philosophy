    "main_text": "Events and Other Categories || Events vs. Objects\n1.1 Events vs. Objects\n\nAlthough not undisputed, some standard differences between events and\nphysical objects are commonplace in the philosophical literature.\nFirst, there would seem to be a difference in their respective modes\nof being: material objects such as stones and chairs are said to\nexist; events are said to occur or happen\nor take place (Hacker 1982a; Cresswell 1986). Second, there\nwould seem to be differences in the way objects and events relate to\nspace and time. Ordinary objects are supposed to have relatively crisp\nspatial boundaries and vague temporal boundaries; events, by contrast,\nwould have relatively vague spatial boundaries and crisp temporal\nboundaries. Objects are said to be invidiously located in\nspace\u2014they occupy their spatial location; events\ntolerate co-location much more easily (Quinton 1979; Hacker 1982b).\nObjects can move; events cannot (Dretske 1967). Finally, objects are\nstandardly construed as enduring continuants\u2014they are\nin time and persist through time by being wholly present at every\ntime at which they exist; events are perduring occurrents\u2014they\ntake up time and persist by having different parts or\n\u201cstages\u201d at different times (Johnson 1921; Mellor 1980;\nSimons 2000).\n\nThe last distinction is perhaps the most controversial. On the one\nhand, there are philosophers\u2014from Whitehead (1919), Broad\n(1923), and Russell (1927) to Quine (1950), Lewis (1986c), Heller\n(1990), Sider (2001) and many others\u2014who conceive of objects as\nfour-dimensional entities that extend across time just as they extend\nacross space. Some such philosophers would accordingly draw no\nmetaphysically significant distinction between objects and events,\ntreating both as entities of the same kind: an object would simply be\na \u201cmonotonous\u201d event; an event would be an\n\u201cunstable\u201d object (Goodman 1951). More generally, the\nrelevant distinction would be one of degree, and while\n\u2018event\u2019 is standardly applied to things that develop and\nchange fast in time, \u2018object\u2019 would apply to those things\nthat strike us as \u201cfirm and internally coherent\u201d (Quine\n1970). On the other hand, there are also philosophers who reject the\ndistinction on the side of events, by construing at least some such\nentities\u2014e.g., processes\u2014as continuants: what is present\nat any moment when an apple is decaying or a person is walking down\nthe street is the whole enduring process, not just part of it (Roberts\n1979; Stout 1997, 2003, 2016; Galton 2006a,b, 2008; Galton &\nMizoguchi 2009; Kassel 2019). This view, in turn, admits of several\nvariants and alternatives, e.g. based on different ways of\nunderstanding the notion of a continuant (Steward 2013, 2015) or its\nrelation to the stuff of which a continuant is composed (Crowther\n2011, 2018).\n\nIf a metaphysical distinction between objects and events is granted,\nthen a question arises as to the relation between the entities in the\ntwo categories. Objects are prime actors in events; objectless events\nare uncommon. But so are eventless objects; events make up the lives\nof objects. In a radical mood, however, one may think of the entities\nin one category as being metaphysically dependent on entities in the\nother. For instance, it has been claimed that events supervene on\ntheir participants (Lombard 1986; Bennett 1988) as it has been claimed\nthat objects depend for their existence on the events in which they\nparticipate (Deleuze 1969; Parsons 1991), or that they exist at any\ngiven time just insofar as they participate in some events occurring\nat that time (Costa 2017). In a more moderate way, one can grant\nobjects and events an equal ontological status but maintain that\neither objects or events are primary in the order of thought. Thus, it\nhas been argued that a pure event-based ontology would not be\nsufficient for the success of our re-identifying practices, which\nrequire a stable frame of reference of the sort that is adequately\nprovided only by objects (Strawson 1959). A similar asymmetry between\nobjects and events seems to be endorsed by natural language, which has\nexpressions such as \u2018the fall of the apple\u2019 but not\n\u2018the pomification of the fall\u2019. However, these asymmetries\nmay be attenuated to the extent that objects, too, may and sometimes\nmust be identified via reference to events. For example, if we track\ndown the father of Sebastian or the author of Waverley, it is\nby identifying certain events in the first place\u2014of fathering\nand of writing, respectively (Moravcsik 1965; Davidson 1969; Lycan\n1970; Thalberg 1978; Tiles 1981).\n",
