As the example of morality already suggests, egoists are\nlikely to find themselves in conflict with some cherished social\ninstitutions and practices. Stirner consistently associates\n(non-egoistic) society with relationships of \u201cbelonging\u201d,\nwhich he treats as involving the subjugation of individuals. For\nexample, he maintains that \u201cthe forming of family ties binds a\nman\u201d (102). Stirner never seriously considers the possibility\nthat belonging might, at least potentially or in some cases, have more\npositive associations; for example, of being at home or of feeling\nsecure. Confronted with the conflict between egoism and\n\u201csociety\u201d, Stirner is not prompted to re-examine his\ncommitment to, or understanding of, self-rule, but instead confidently\ndenies the legitimacy of those conventional institutions and\npractices. Two examples of this radical response may noted here.\n\nOn Stirner\u2019s account, there is a necessary antipathy between the\negoistic individual and the state. This inevitable hostility is based\non the conflict between Stirner\u2019s conception of autonomy and any\nobligation to obey the law. \u201cOwn will and the state\u201d, he\nwrites, \u201care powers in deadly hostility, between which no\n\u2018perpetual peace\u2019 is possible\u201d (175). Since\nself-rule is incompatible with, and valued more highly than, any\nobligation to obey the law, Stirner rejects the legitimacy of\npolitical obligation. Note that this rejection stands irrespective of\nthe foundation of that political obligation, and whatever the form of\nthe state. \u201cEvery state\u201d, Stirner insists, \u201cis a\ndespotism, be the despot one or many\u201d (175). Even in the\nhypothetical case of a direct democracy in which a collective decision\nhad been made unanimously, Stirner denies that the egoist would be\nbound by the result. To be bound today by \u201cmy will of\nyesterday\u201d, he maintains, would be to turn my\n\u201ccreature\u201d, that is \u201ca particular expression of\nwill\u201d, into my \u201ccommander\u201d; it would be to freeze my\nwill, and Stirner denies that \u201cbecause I was a fool yesterday I\nmust remain such\u201d (175).\n\nPromise-keeping is another early victim of this commitment to, and\nunderstanding of, self-rule. Stirner associates the institution of\npromising with illegitimate constraint, since the requirement that\nduly made promises be kept is incompatible with his understanding of\nindividual autonomy. Stirner rejects any general obligation to keep\npromises as just another attempt to bind the individual. The egoist,\nhe suggests, must embrace the heroism of the lie, and be willing to\nbreak even his own word \u201cin order to determine himself instead\nof being determined\u201d (210). Note that Stirner\u2019s enthusiasm\nfor lying excludes those who break their word in the service of some\nlarger goal \u2014 as Luther, for example, became unfaithful to his\nmonastic vows for God\u2019s sake \u2014 and is reserved only for\nthose individuals who are willing to break their word for their own\nsake.\n\nAs well as a negative account of the institutions and practices that\negoists must reject as incompatible with autonomy, The Ego and Its\nOwn also contains some positive suggestions about the possible\nshape of egoistic relationships which do not conflict with individual\nself-rule. In particular, Stirner provides a brief sketch of what he\ncalls the \u201cunion of egoists [Verein von\nEgoisten]\u201d (161).\n\nThe egoistic future is said to consist not of wholly isolated\nindividuals but rather in relationships of \u201cuniting\u201d, that\nis, in impermanent connections between individuals who themselves\nremain independent and self-determining. The central feature of the\nresulting \u201cunion of egoists\u201d is that it does not involve\nthe subordination of the individual. The union is \u201ca son and\nco-worker\u201d (273) of autonomy, a constantly shifting alliance\nwhich enables individuals to unite without loss of sovereignty,\nwithout swearing allegiance to anyone else\u2019s \u201cflag\u201d\n(210). This union of egoists constitutes a purely instrumental\nassociation whose good is solely the advantage that the individuals\nconcerned may derive for the pursuit of their individual goals; there\nare no shared final ends and the association is not valued in itself.\nIn his reply to \u201cStirner\u2019s Critics\u201d, he imagines two\npleasingly familiar street scenes to illustrate this model of egoistic\nunion: in the first, children happen upon each other and spontaneously\nengage in the \u201ccomradeship of play\n[Spielkameradschaft]\u201d; and, in the second, Moses Hess\n(one of the critics in question) bumps into friends before all decide\nto adjourn for a drink, not out of loyalty, but in the expectation of\npleasure (Stirner 1914: 295\u20136).\n\nStirner sometimes seems torn as how best to elucidate this basic\naccount of egoistic social relations. At least, in The Ego and Its\nOwn, his elaboration of egoistic relations can appear to\nequivocate between: on the one hand, downplaying the social and\npsychological impact of a shift to egoistic relationships, and on the\nother hand, acknowledging and defending the dramatic and perturbing\nconsequences of such a move.\n\nIn the first, and less predominant, of these moods, Stirner strives to\nmoderate the suggestion that his views might have radical and\nunforeseen consequences. More precisely, he suggests that certain\nfamiliar and worthwhile relationships \u2014 such as\n\u201clove\u201d \u2014 can continue into the egoistic future. This\nsuggestion is presumably aimed at making that egoistic future appear\nless disruptive and more attractive, not least to those attached to\nthese familiar and worthwhile relationships.\n\nThat said, it is far from certain that all of the relevant\nrelationships would survive intact from their reincarnation in\negoistic form. Consider, for example, Stirner\u2019s contrast between\ntwo different kinds of love: the \u201cbad case\u201d where\n\u201cownness\u201d is sacrificed, and the good case of egoistic\nlove in which self-rule is retained. Egoistic love allows the\nindividual to deny themself something in order to enhance the pleasure\nof another, but only because their own pleasure is enhanced as a\nresult. The object of egoistic love, in other words, remains the\nindividual themself. The egoist will not sacrifice their autonomy and\ninterests to another, but rather loves only as long as \u201clove\nmakes me happy\u201d (258). At one point, Stirner characterises this\nrelationship as one in which the individual \u201cenjoys\u201d the\nother (258). The description is a revealing one, since enjoying\nanother person and loving them would appear to be rather different\nmatters. Loving another person in the conventional (and non-egoistic)\nsense might be thought to include the desire to promote the welfare of\nthat person, even when it is not in our interests, or when it\nconflicts with our own wants and happiness. In this respect, it stands\nat some distance from Stirner\u2019s account of egoistic love. The\npoint here is not a terminological one\u2014Stirner rightly cares\nlittle whether we call egoistic love \u201clove\u201d and\n\u201chence stick to the old sound\u201d (261) or whether we invent\na new vocabulary\u2014but rather that a world without this experience\nwould be an unfamiliar and impoverished one. Stirner has not obviously\nsucceeded in establishing that this particular familiar and worthwhile\nrelationship would survive reestablishment on egoistic premises. (For\na more positive verdict, see Cleary 2015.)\n\nIn the second, and more predominant, of these moods, Stirner\ncelebrates the radical and unfamiliar consequences of adopting an\negoistic order. Indeed, in places, he seems to revel in the clam that\nhis views have startling consequences from which few of his readers\nwill take any solace. This is one of the sources of the melodramatic\nand provocative tone that permeates many parts of The Ego and Its\nOwn.\n\nStirner describes the appropriate relation between the egoist and\ntheir objects \u2014 which include, of course, other persons as well\nas things \u2014 as a property relation. The egoist properly stands\nin a relation of \u201cownership\u201d to the wider world. This\nnotion of \u201cegoistic property\u201d is not to be confused with\nmore familiar juridical concepts of ownership (such as private\nproperty or collective ownership). These more familiar forms of\nproperty rest on notions of right, and involve claims to exclusivity\nor constraints on use, which Stirner rejects. Egoistic property is\nrather constituted by the \u201cunlimited dominion\u201d (223) of\nindividuals over the world, by which Stirner appears to mean that\nthere are no moral constraints on how an individual might relate to\nthese persons and things. Stirner sometimes describes the resulting\nassociation between people as involving relationships \u201cof\nutility, of use\u201d (263). The egoist, he suggests, views others as\n\u201cnothing but\u2014my food, even as I am fed upon and turned to\nuse by you\u201d (263). Stirner embraces the stark consequences of\nthis rejection of any general obligation towards others, insisting,\nfor example, that the egoist does not renounce \u201ceven the power\nover life and death\u201d (282). Over the course of the book, Stirner\nvariously declines to condemn the officer\u2019s widow who strangles\nher child (281), the man who treats his sister \u201cas wife\nalso\u201d (45), and the murderer who no longer fears his act as a\n\u201cwrong\u201d (169). In a world in which \u201cwe owe each\nother nothing\u201d (263), it seems that acts of infanticide, incest,\nand murder, might all turn out to be justified.\n\nAt one point, Stirner acknowledges that few readers of The Ego and\nIts Own will draw any comfort from this vision of an egoistic\nfuture, but insists that the welfare of this audience is not of any\ninterest to him. Indeed, Stirner suggests that, if he had been\nmotivated by a concern for others, then he would have had to conceal\nrather than propagate his ideas. As it is, Stirner maintains that even\nif he had believed that these ideas would lead to the \u201cbloodiest\nwars and the fall of many generations\u201d (263) he would still have\ndisseminated them.\n",
