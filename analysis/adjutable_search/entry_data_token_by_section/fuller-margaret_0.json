    "main_text": "Biography\n1. Biography\n\nMargaret Fuller was born in Cambridgeport, Massachusetts, on 23 May\n1810, the eldest child of Timothy Fuller and Margarett\nCrane Fuller. (Cambridgeport is now part of Cambridge,\nMassachusetts, and the Margaret Fuller House where she was born is\nstill standing.) Timothy Fuller was elected a Congressman from\nMassachusetts in 1817 and served until 1825. He lavished upon his\neldest daughter a rigorous classical education usually reserved for\nboys. He taught her how to read at age three and a half, and she\nproved a child prodigy who rewarded Timothy\u2019s attention. Her\nchildhood curriculum included Latin prose, poetry, and composition,\nsupplemented by Greek writings that included the New Testament as well\nas the classical philosophers, along with natural philosophy (natural\nscience) and the wide-ranging discipline then called moral philosophy,\nwhich subsumed what we call the social sciences. When she was nine,\nher father added The Spectator, Paradise Lost, and\nDr. Samuel Johnson to her reading list. Timothy\u2019s stern manner\nand demanding requirements left young Margaret with emotional as well\nas scholarly legacies: she became obsessive and self-critical. \n\nFormal schooling only began for Margaret in 1819; starting in 1824 she\nboarded at the School for Young Ladies in Groton for two years, then\nreturned home. There she resumed her study of the classics. She found\nthe Greeks more congenial than the Romans, identifying the Greeks with\nidealism, imagination, and freedom, the Romans with practicality,\nlogic, and stern composure. Her readings were supplemented now by the\nRomantic literature taking shape in Europe, which she found\nfascinating. By the time she was in her thirties, she could be\nregarded as the best-read person, male or female, in New England\n(Douglas 1977: 263). She ended up espousing an avowedly dual\nphilosophy that sought to embrace both classical and Romantic\noutlooks. She taught that the Platonic tradition celebrated masculine\nqualities while Romanticism celebrated feminine ones. Humanity as\nwhole needed both\u2014and each individual person should cultivate\nboth their masculinity and their femininity.\n\nMeanwhile, however, Timothy Fuller\u2019s political ambitions had not\nbeen realized and his law practice shrank to the point where he\ndecided in 1833 to move to Groton, Massachusetts, and operate (like\nmany other Americans of the time) a family farm. The farm had not yet\nbegun to turn a profit, however, when Margaret\u2019s father died of\ncholera in October, 1835. Timothy had not drawn up a will, and by the\nmale-oriented law of the time, title to the farm passed to his\nbrothers, leaving his widow and children living on the farm dependent\non the charity of Margaret\u2019s uncles. Margaret felt\nunderstandably bitter, and though only in her twenties was forced to\nassume responsibility for supporting her mother and young siblings.\nShe had begun work on a biography of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,\nhaving achieved fluency in German remarkably quickly, but gave up on\nit, and the European trip it would have entailed, so she could teach\nschool full time and earn a salary. \n\nMargaret Fuller moved in highly literate circles, both before and\nafter her father\u2019s death. In 1839 she made use of her social\ncontacts when she commenced a series of discussion groups for women\nthat lasted five years; she referred to them as\n\u201cconversations\u201d. Most of these were held in the home of\nher friend and fellow intellectual Elizabeth Palmer Peabody, who also\nfacilitated Fuller\u2019s publishing some pieces. Another friend,\nRalph Waldo Emerson, invited Fuller to edit a journal called The\nDial, an enterprise she undertook in 1840. Fuller was supposed to\nreceive a salary of $200 annually, but the money was never\npaid\u2014one of the reasons why she resigned after two years. She\ncontinued to write for The Dial after no longer editing\nit.\n\nIn 1844 Fuller moved to New York City and went to work for Horace\nGreeley\u2019s famous newspaper, the New York Tribune, as a\nfull-time book reviewer. Where the Dial had a small and\ndeclining circulation, the Tribune had 50,000 subscribers.\nOver the next four years, Fuller wrote over 250 Tribune\narticles on literature, music, and art as well as social and political\nissues. She also published poetry during this period, though her\npoetry has never received much attention. \n\nStarting in 1846, at her own initiative Fuller moved to Europe, first\nto England and then to the Italian peninsula (Italy was not yet a\nunited country), where she served as a foreign correspondent for\nGreeley. While still in England she met two Italians who would remain\nprominent in her life: Giuseppi Mazzini, Italian patriot and\nrepublican leader then in exile, and Giovanni Angelo Ossoli, whom she\neventually married, though it is unclear when or whether they\nparticipated in a wedding ceremony. If such a ceremony did occur, it\nwas after the birth of their baby boy, Angelo Eugene Philip Ossoli,\nnicknamed Angelino or Nino, on 5 September 1848 (Marshall 2013: 350).\n\n\nWhen a Roman Republic was proclaimed in February 1849, the Ossolis\nwere living in the democratic Republic and supporting its cause, led\nby Mazzini. The Republic sought to replace the Pope as temporal ruler\nof Rome, while continuing his spiritual function. The Pope did not\nacquiesce, and requested foreign aid to restore his power. France\nprovided it. In the war that followed, the Ossolis fought on behalf of\nthe Republic, he as a soldier and she as a nurse, but the French\nprevailed, and the Ossolis fled into exile in Florence. \n\nIn 1850 the couple decided to move to the United States, where\nMargaret hoped to publish a book she had written on the short-lived\nRoman Republic, even though Giovanni spoke no English. The family set\nsail in May on a U.S. freighter named the Elizabeth, bound\nfor New York. During the voyage the captain died of smallpox, leaving\nthe first mate as acting captain. Under this inexperienced leadership,\nthe ship ran aground on a sandbar near Fire Island, NY, during a storm\nat 3:30 a.m. on 19 July 1850. Since they were less than 300 yards from\nshore, those who could swim jumped into the water\u2014including the\nacting captain. The Ossoli family could not swim, and were left\nbehind. A crowd formed on shore, but no one tried to rescue the\nOssolis. After 10 hours, a giant wave washed Margaret and her family\nout to sea. Nino\u2019s tiny body was eventually found ashore;\nneither of the adult Ossoli bodies ever was. The manuscript of\nMargaret\u2019s book on the Roman Republic was among the items\nlost.\n",
