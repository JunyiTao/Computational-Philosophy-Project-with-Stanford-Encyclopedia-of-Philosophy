    "main_text": "Religious Minimalism || Minimalism About Religion\n4.1 Minimalism About Religion\n\nThe two key features of minimalism are prominent in Hilary\nPutnam\u2019s Wittgensteinian account of religious language in\nRenewing Philosophy (1992). First, Putnam draws attention to\nWittgenstein\u2019s well-known remarks on family resemblances (1953:\n65\u201366). Wittgenstein\u2019s target in these remarks is the idea\nthat an expression requires necessary and sufficient conditions for\nits correct application. Intuitively, it seems that there must be such\nconditions if the meaning of the expression remains the same when it\nis used in different contexts. However, consider the term\n\u201cgame\u201d, with its varying applications\u2014board games,\ncard games, Olympic games, and so on; we can see, Putnam (following\nWittgenstein) argues, that for any particular condition that appears\nto characterise some types of game, there will be others that fail to\nsatisfy it. Rather than common necessary and sufficient conditions for\nall uses of \u201cgame\u201d, there is a network of similarities and\nrelationships between them. Putnam proposes that Wittgenstein took a\nsimilar lesson to apply to notions like language,\nreference and truth: \n\n\nreferring uses don\u2019t have an \u201cessence\u201d; there\nisn\u2019t some one thing which can be called referring. There are\noverlapping similarities between one sort of referring and the next,\nthat is all. (1992: 167\u20138) \n\n\nPhilosophical confusion results when, for instance, we attempt to\napply standards of reference appropriate to descriptions of the\nperceived world to mathematical claims. Putnam then extends this point\nto religion: \n\n\nThe use of religious language is both like and unlike ordinary cases\nof reference: but to ask whether it is \u201creally\u201d reference\nor \u201cnot really\u201d reference is to be in a muddle. There is\nno essence of reference \u2026 In short, Wittgenstein is telling you\nwhat isn\u2019t the way to understand religious language.\nThe way to understand religious language isn\u2019t to try to apply\nsome metaphysical classification of possible forms of discourse.\n(1992: 168) \n\n\nA similar point is taken to extend to truth, descriptiveness and other\nrealism-relevant concepts.\n\nSecond, Putnam argues that truth can be understood as idealised\nrational\n acceptability.[6]\n This is not to say that truth depends on justification here and\nnow\u2014that is, what seems to us justified on currently\navailable evidence\u2014but rather that truth is not independent of\nall justification: \u201cTo claim a statement is true is to claim it\ncould be justified\u201d (1981: 56). To be truth-apt, it is sufficient that the assertoric\nutterances of religious discourse are governed by internal standards\nof warrant. While the standards of warrant in a given area of\nreligious discourse may be significantly different to those in science\n(appealing to the authority of the Bible or the Pope, for instance,\nwould not count in favour of a scientific theory), the condition that\nthere are such standards is clearly satisfied. To arrive at a positive\naccount of what constitutes truth (and other realism-relevant\nconcepts) in religion, therefore, requires an examination of\nthe specific standards of justification that are in play in religious\ndiscourse (or, more accurately, the different standards in different\nreligious discourses).\n\nD.Z. Phillips was a leading interpreter and champion of a\nWittgensteinian approach to philosophy of religion. His early writings\nappear sympathetic to a non-cognitivist account of religious\ndiscourse. He questions whether religious utterances are descriptive\nand proposes, for instance, that \u201creligious belief is itself the\nexpression of a moral vision\u201d (1976: 143) and that \n\n\nthe praising and the glorifying does not refer to some object called\nGod. Rather, the expression of such praise and glory is what we call\nthe worship of God. (1976: 149) \n\n\nIn his later writings from the 1990s, however, Phillips\u2019 remarks\nappear more minimalist.\n\n\nBy all means say that \u201cGod\u201d functions as a referring\nexpression, that \u201cGod\u201d refers to a sort of object, that\nGod\u2019s reality is a matter of fact, and so on. But please\nremember that, as yet, no conceptual or grammatical clarification has\ntaken place. We have all the work still to do since we shall now\nhave to show, in this religious context, what speaking of\n\u201creference\u201d, \u201cobject\u201d,\n\u201cexistence\u201d, and so on amounts to, how it differs, in\nobvious ways, from other uses of these terms. (1995: 138)\n\n\nHere, Phillips allows that religious expressions refer and religious\nsentences are descriptive, etc., but proposes\u2014in line with\nminimalism\u2014that the reference and descriptiveness of religious\ndiscourse is partly constituted by features distinctive of religious\ndiscourse. For a detailed and sympathetic treatment of Phillips\u2019\nwork see Burley 2012 and for a critique see Scott & Moore\n1997.\n\nIn general, religious minimalists agree on a number of points. They\ngrant that religious statements have propositional content, and may be\ntrue, descriptive, factual, and so on. Second, realism-relevant\nconcepts are understood as language game internal concepts.\nTo know what makes for truth in religion, for instance, we need to\nlook at the internal standards of justification that inform religious\ndiscourse. Third, the primary aim of minimalism, at least in the\nWittgensteinian form it takes in philosophy of religion, is to\nelucidate the different standards that characterise different areas of\ndiscourse, and to spell out the differences between realism-relevant\nconcepts in religion and realism-relevant concepts in science or\nhistory. However, there is also an important area of disagreement\nbetween religious minimalists. Phillips takes the different\nconstitution of truth in different areas discourse to show that\n\u201ctrue\u201d means something different in different\ndiscourses: We have multiple truth concepts, with different extensions\n(1976: 142; 1995: 149). In contrast, Putnam appears to be more\nsympathetic to a pluralist account of truth: the truth\npredicate has certain necessary and sufficient conditions for its use\n(such as the disquotational schema) but may be additionally\nconstituted by different further conditions according to whether we\nare talking about religious truths, scientific truths, or ethical\ntruths (see Wright 1992: ch. 2). Fragmentary accounts of truth of the\nkind that Phillips appears to endorse have been widely\ncriticised\u2014see, for example, Timothy Williamson (1994: 141)\nChristine Tappolet (1997).\n\nReligious minimalism is usually offered as a program of research\nrather than a detailed account of religious discourse. There is talk\nof the need to attend to the practices and forms of life of religious\nbelievers, an emphasis on the difference between religious and other\nareas of discourse, and warnings against applying scientific or\nhistorical standards to religious judgements, but the positive story\nof the meaning of religious utterances is often left as a promissory\nnote. However, there are some areas where more substantial points of\ndisagreement can be pursued. For instance, many supporters of the face\nvalue theory will reject the pluralist or fragmentary accounts of\ntruth that inform the minimalist approach. Also, even if one is\nsympathetic to a pluralist account of truth, it does not\nstraightforwardly follow that truth in religion is different from\ntruth in science or history (for a defense of this point see Scott\n2013: ch. 11). Religious minimalism will also be rejected by\nnon-cognitivists. If the descriptiveness of religious language is\nsecured as easily as minimalists propose, then this will undermine the\nnon-cognitivist position that it is\u2014despite superficial\nappearances\u2014not descriptive. Non-cognitivists argue that the\n\u201cpropositional surface\u201d of language conceals a variety of\ndifferent functions: ethical statements express approval or\ndisapproval, mathematical statements are stipulations, and so on. For\na defense of this see Blackburn 1998.\n",
