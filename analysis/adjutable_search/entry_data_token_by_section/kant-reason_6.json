    "main_text": "Practical reason: morality and the primacy of pure practical reason || Freedom implies moral constraint: the Categorical Imperative\n2.1 Freedom implies moral constraint: the Categorical Imperative\n\nAlongside the derivation of his supreme moral principle, the most\ndifficult questions about Kant\u2019s view of practical reason center\non its relation to freedom. Although the broad outlines are\nconsistent, Kant\u2019s views on this topic seem to shift more than\nother aspects of his critical thought. (See\n Kant\u2019s moral philosophy,\n \u00a710, for a brief sketch, and Allison 1990 for a full account.)\nThis section and the following\n \u00a72.2\n focus on Kant\u2019s radical claim that \u201cfreedom and\nunconditional practical law [that is, the Categorical Imperative]\nreciprocally imply each other\u201d (5:29f). Freedom implies that\npractical reason can be pure (non-instrumental, unconditional), and\nhence that we are subject to the Categorical Imperative. Our\nsubjection to morality implies that we must be free.\n\nKant\u2019s argument that freedom implies the Categorical Imperative\nis brief (see Critique of Practical Reason, 5:19\u201330).\nIf I am free to step back from my inclinations, those inclinations\ncannot provide a definitive reason to act. Inclinations motivate, but\nthey do not compel. If someone asks me why I did something,\ninclinations may\u00a0explain my action\u2014the action\nhelped me achieve something I wanted. But there is still an open\nquestion: should I have acted on those inclinations?\n\nAn example may help here. Pushing you out of the way might satisfy my\ndesire to get to the front of the queue. The desire motivates me; we\nmight say that it provides a \u201creason for me.\u201d For other\npeople, my desire only explains my rudeness. It does not\nsupply others with a reason to endorse my behavior; it does not\njustify my doing this. Compare the entry on\n reasons for action: justification, motivation, explanation:\n \u201cBecause I wanted to\u201d may be a \u201cmotivating\nreason\u201d for me; it may be an \u201cexplanatory reason\u201d\nfor other people. But it is not a \u201cjustificatory reason.\u201d\nKant accepts that desires are relevant to practical reasoning. His\nclaim is that they need not, and should not, determine our reasoning.\nSimply put, my inclinations do not matter more than other\npeople\u2019s.\n\nHow can we find reasons that others should also accept? Kant claims\nthe only possibility is to look to \u201cthe mere form of\ngiving universal law\u201d (5:27). There is, he says, \u201conly a\nsingle categorical imperative\u2026 act only according to that\nmaxim through which you can at the same time will that it become a\nuniversal law\u201d (4:421). This principle is categorical (no\nif-s or but-s!); it is an imperative (we must follow it!).\nWhen our action passes this test, we have done our duty. (In fact, the\nfirst section of the Groundwork argues that this principle\nfollows just by analyzing the idea of duty. For more detailed\ndiscussion see\n Kant\u2019s moral philosophy,\n \u00a72\u2013\u00a75.)\n\nKant\u2019s emphasis on duty may sound old-fashioned; the idea of\njustifying your conduct is more familiar, especially when we think\nabout practical reasoning. However, duty and justification\nare inseparable. To claim that you have done your duty is to hold that\nyour actions are justified. Other people should endorse your\nactions as the right thing to do. If they resent or frustrate your\nactions, they are acting unreasonably\u2014not you.\n\nBut why does Kant think that the \u201cthe mere form of\ngiving universal law\u201d can capture the idea of duty, or reveal\nwhat sort of action is justified?\n\nTwo points are central. First, the \u201cform of\u2026 law\u201d\nrefers to an overall policy or principle. Without this, my actions\nwould be random and make no sense, even to me. Second, Kant refers to\n\u201cgiving universal law.\u201d Not just any policy or principle\nwill do. A justification is meant to provide other people with reasons\nto endorse my conduct\u2014common sense already tells us that many\npolicies won\u2019t do this. In fact, Kant argues that there is only\none. My policy must be to act on principles that everyone else can\nalso adopt. This is what he means by \u201cuniversal law.\u201d\n\nTo give a better sense of what he means, Kant notes some other\nprinciples that seem law-like, but go beyond the \u201cmere\nform of universal law\u201d\u2014and thereby fail to be justifiable.\nIn the second Critique (5:39ff), he discusses six such\ncandidates. Here is one example to illustrate.\n\nKant sees Epicurus as advocating the following policy: always follow\nyour inclinations, wherever they might lead. This might sound\nlaw-like\u2014it directs action, just as ordinary laws tell you to\npay your taxes or drive on the left. It may even sound like a law that\na free agent could adopt. While it deprives you of the freedom to act\nin ways you don\u2019t want, it preserves something that\nsounds much more worthwhile: the freedom to do whatever you\ndo want. However, it goes beyond the \u201cform of\nlaw\u201d because it tells you to submit to merely subjective\nfactors\u2014your inclinations, whatever they may be. This raises two\nproblems.\n\nFirst, the policy is not actually law-like in practice\u2014my\ninclinations change and conflict with one another. For example,\nshort-term inclinations often undermine longer-term ones; often\nit\u2019s impossible to get everything we wish for. This isn\u2019t\nso much freedom, more a recipe for confusion. To act coherently, I\nneed to discipline and rank my inclinations. In other words, my will\nwould contradict itself if I tried only to follow inclinations. I\nwould not really have a will\u2014in Kant\u2019s terms, there is a\ncontradiction in even conceiving this policy.\n\nSecond, it is not a policy that everyone can follow. If they did, the\nresults would be utterly chaotic; they would defeat anyone\u2019s\nattempts to satisfy their inclinations. In Kant\u2019s terms, there\nis a contradiction in willing such a policy. So far as we can\neven imagine this, we see straightaway that each person\u2019s\nwilling would predictably fail.\n (Kant\u2019s moral philosophy,\n \u00a75, explores these two contradictions, in conception and in\nwilling.)\n\nIn more abstract terms: such a policy is unreasonable because it gives\nauthority to particular features of one particular agent\u2014worse,\nto features that aren\u2019t even stable or mutually consistent. In\nKant\u2019s words:\n\nit is requisite to reason\u2019s lawgiving that it should need to\npresuppose only itself, because a rule is objectively and\nuniversally valid only when it holds without the contingent,\nsubjective conditions that distinguish one rational being from\nanother. (5:21)\n\n\nNo principle is truly law-like unless it abstracts from an\nagent\u2019s particular motivations and situation. Every other\npossibility looks for substantive guidance from outside of reason\nitself\u2014just as a hypothetical imperative only guides you\nif you already want to pursue that end. Kant refers to this\nbasic difficulty as heteronomy\u2014that is, reasoning\ndirected from the outside. This external authority might be my\ninclinations, or religious dogma, or even a political authority. But\nit is merely assumed or imposed; it cannot justify itself.\nHeteronomous reasoning does not address the fundamental problem: to\nfind principles that are entitled to guide everyone\u2019s acting and\nthinking. In the word Kant has made so famous, reasoning must be\nautonomous\u2014that is, self-governed.\n\nThere have been many doubts whether the mere \u201cform of law\u201d\ncan really provide concrete guidance. In reply, Kantians argue that it\nrepresents a substantial constraint: we must avoid all ways of\nthinking and acting that cannot be followed by all. (For discussion\nsee inter alia O\u2019Neill 1989: Ch. 5; Herman 1993;\nAllison 1990: Ch. 10 \u00a7II.) If this is true, then the autonomy of\nreason reveals the positive sense of freedom at the heart of\nKant\u2019s practical philosophy (cf. Brandom 1979). That is, reason\nenables us to act in ways that do not rely on\n\u201ccontingent, subjective conditions that distinguish one rational\nbeing from another\u201d (5:21). It enables us to justify our conduct\nto one another. It empowers us to build communities around principles\nthat everyone can share.\n",
