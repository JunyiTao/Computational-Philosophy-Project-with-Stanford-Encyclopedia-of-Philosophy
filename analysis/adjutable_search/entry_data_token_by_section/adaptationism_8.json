Species with a recent\ncommon ancestor may have inherited the same trait from the ancestor, as\nopposed to evolving it independently of one another. Comparative\nmethods help one assess the extent to which a set of related species\nprovide independent evidence for or against a given evolutionary\nhypothesis (Harvey and Pagel 1991). The general awareness of the need\nto use such methods stems primarily from the initially narrower debate\nthat took place within systematics in the 1960s and 1970s over how to\ncreate classifications of organisms that are \u201cscientific\u201d\nand as such, are transparent recipes that are accessible to others,\ninstead of being \u201cprivate\u201d and non-scientific. This debate\ngenerated tremendous controversy (Hull 1988) and it spurred on the\ndevelopment of methods to statistically correct for dependence among\nspecies' trait values when assessing an adaptive hypothesis\n(Felsenstein 1985, Harvey and Pagel 1991). In addition, it became more\nwidely understood that a claim that one trait evolved in response to\nanother is enormously strengthened by phylogenetic confirmation; the\nhistory of trait acquisition must be consistent with the hypothesis\n(see Maddison 1990 and references therein).\n\n\n These developments are salutary in\nthat they show biologists how to better test adaptive hypotheses and\nhave clarified the phylogenetic assumptions that are necessary to test\nadaptive hypotheses (Sober and Orzack 2003). As such, they are a\nmethodological improvement that has generally gained a positive\nreception among philosophers of biology (e.g., Sterelny and Griffiths\n1999). Many biologists agree, but controversy continues. Some\nacknowledge the potential importance of comparative methods but point\nto limitations that may reduce their usefulness (Reeve and Sherman\n2001, Leroi et al. 1994). As such, these critiques are consistent with\nmethodological adaptationism. Others view any allusion to potential\nnon-adaptive influences on trait evolution to be mistaken; in their\nview, the importance of phylogenetic methods is that they help reveal\ncomplete history of natural selection on the trait (Grafen 1989). As\nsuch, this is a critique consistent with the espousal of empirical\nadaptationism.\n",
