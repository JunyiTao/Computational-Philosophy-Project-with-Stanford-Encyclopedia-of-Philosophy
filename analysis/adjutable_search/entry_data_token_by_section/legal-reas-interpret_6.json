    "main_text": "The Role of Coherence in Legal Reasoning:\n3. The Role of Coherence in Legal Reasoning:\n\n\nAs several commentators have noted (see Kress 1984; Marmor 1992; Raz\n1994a), coherence theories, long influential in other areas of\nphilosophy (see, for example, the entries on the\n coherence theory of truth\n and\ncoherentist theories of epistemic justification) have more recently\nfound their way into the philosophy of law (for a general survey of\ncoherence theories in law which also considers them in the context of\ncoherence theories of truth, justified belief, ethics and justice, see\nKress 1996). While this migration may be attributed in part to the\nfrequent influence of the general philosophical climate upon the\nintellectual weather systems of jurisprudential theorising, it also\nmakes sense to ask whether there is something about the nature of law\nwhich makes it particularly ripe for explanation via coherence\naccounts. For example, those commentators who view Ronald Dworkin's\ntheory of law as integrity as a coherence account appear to answer\nthis question in the affirmative (see e.g. Kress 1984; Hurley 1989):\ncoherence, in the sense of interpreting the law as speaking with one\nvoice as integrity requires, is a value which is supposed to have\nspecial relevance in the legal realm, in terms of the role which it\nshould play in guiding judges seeking to interpret the law\ncorrectly. It has also been noted that features of the law such as the\ndoctrine of precedent, arguments from analogy, and the requirement\nthat like cases be treated alike seem particularly apt to be\nilluminated via some kind of coherence explanation. (See Kress 1984.\nRaz 1994a notes the temptation here, but contends that there is\nnothing inherent in arguments from analogy or in the requirement that\nlike cases be treated alike which demands that they be understood in\nterms of a coherence account of adjudication. On the role of arguments\nfrom analogy in legal reasoning more generally, see Weinreb 2005, and\nalso the entry\n precedent and analogy in legal reasoning.)\n Moreover, the idea of coherence as a special virtue of\ninterpretation in legal reasoning plays an important role in the work\nof several major continental legal philosophers (see e.g. Peczenik\n1989; Alexy 1989; Aarnio 1987; Alexy & Peczenik 1990). \n\n\nThe following discussion attempts to explore some of these issues\nconcerning whether and why considerations of coherence have an\nimportant role to play in understanding law. As this entry seeks to\nilluminate the role of coherence in legal reasoning, the emphasis here\nis on coherence accounts of adjudication, and on examining the role\nwhich coherence plays in courts' reasoning about how to decide cases\naccording to law. This being so, this part of the entry discusses legal\nreasoning in the sense outlined in formulation (b) in Section 1 (\"What\nDo Legal Theorists Mean By \u2018Legal Reasoning\u2019?\"), i.e.\nreasoning from the content of the existing law on a given issue to the\ndecision which a court should reach in a case involving that issue\nwhich comes before it.\n",
