    "main_text": "Objections to Objectivism\n9. Objections to Objectivism\n\n\u201cWhen I was young,\u201d writes Russell,\n\n\nI agreed with G.E. Moore in believing in the objectivity of good and\nevil. Santayana\u2019s criticism in a book called Winds of\nDoctrine, [which Russell read in 1913] caused me to abandon this\nview, though I have never been able to be as bland and comfortable\nabout it as he was. (Portraits from Memory: 91)\n\n\nAs a piece of intellectual autobiography this is not very\nilluminating. Santayana\u2019s book abounds in mellifluous sneers, but\narguments are conspicuous by their absence. Russell\u2019s reasons for\nrejecting a non-natural property of goodness have to be reconstructed\nfrom literary asides, delivered in passing in the course of his\nanti-War polemics.\n",
