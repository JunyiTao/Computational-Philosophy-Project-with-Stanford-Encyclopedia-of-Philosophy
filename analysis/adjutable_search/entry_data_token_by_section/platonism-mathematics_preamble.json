    "main_text": "\n\nPlatonism about mathematics (or mathematical platonism) is\nthe metaphysical view that there are abstract mathematical objects\nwhose existence is independent of us and our language, thought, and\npractices. Just as electrons and planets exist independently of us, so\ndo numbers and sets. And just as statements about electrons and\nplanets are made true or false by the objects with which they are\nconcerned and these objects\u2019 perfectly objective properties, so\nare statements about numbers and sets. Mathematical truths are\ntherefore discovered, not invented.\n\nThe most important argument for the existence of abstract mathematical\nobjects derives from Gottlob Frege and goes as follows (Frege 1953).\nThe language of mathematics purports to refer to and quantify over\nabstract mathematical objects. And a great number of mathematical\ntheorems are true. But a sentence cannot be true unless its\nsub-expressions succeed in doing what they purport to do. So there\nexist abstract mathematical objects that these expressions refer to\nand quantify over.\n\nFrege\u2019s argument notwithstanding, philosophers have developed a\nvariety of objections to mathematical platonism. Thus, abstract\nmathematical objects are claimed to be epistemologically inaccessible\nand metaphysically problematic. Mathematical platonism has been among\nthe most hotly debated topics in the philosophy of mathematics over\nthe past few decades.\n",
