    "main_text": "Contrast || No Contrast: the Umbrella View\n1.1 No Contrast: the Umbrella View\n\nOn one natural reading, the Contrast Question admits of an easy\nanswer; fix\u2014perhaps by stipulation\u2014the content of\n\u2018object\u2019 and it will be obvious whether there are\nnon-objects. Unsurprisingly, then, some philosophers suppose that\nthere is a fully general category and simply define\n\u2018object\u2019 as picking it out. On this Umbrella\nView, as we shall call it, every thing is an object\n(perhaps by definition of \u2018object\u2019) and the category has\nno contrast\u2014or, if it has a contrast or complement, the contrast\nis unfilled and the complement unrealized.\n\nIs the Umbrella View true? Dispute here may appear merely\nverbal, to merely concern how to use the word\n \u2018object\u2019.[3]\n This is not quite right, however. So to clarify: the Umbrella View\ninvolves both a substantive metaphysical thesis and a semantic thesis.\nThe metaphysical thesis is that there is a maximally general\nontological category under which all things fall. The semantic thesis\nis that \u2018object\u2019\u2014perhaps as a matter of\nstipulation\u2014picks out this maximally general category. Disputes\nover the Umbrella View, then, are merely verbal in part. They\nare merely verbal insofar as they concern the semantic thesis. But\ndisputes over the metaphysical thesis need not be\u2014and in our\nview are not\u2014merely verbal; they do not concern the English word\n\u2018object\u2019, but rather concern the existence and extent of a\nwholly general ontological category.\n\nNote, too, that the component theses of the Umbrella View are\nlogically independent. First, the semantic thesis does not entail the\nmetaphysical thesis any more than the semantic thesis that\n\u2018God\u2019\u2014by definition\u2014picks out a maximally\ngreat being entails the metaphysical thesis that there is indeed such\na being. Second, the metaphysical thesis does not entail the semantic\nthesis; that there is a maximally general category does not entail\nthat it is picked out by any word at all, much less the English word\n\u2018object\u2019.\n\nA consequence of the Umbrella View is that items that appear to have\nlittle in common\u2014universals, particulars, gods, books,\npossibilities, colleges, works of music (if such there are)\u2014are\nin fact all united under one category: object.\n\nTo be sure, not all who endorse the Umbrella View deploy the English\nword \u2018object\u2019 in explicating the view. Other candidates\nfor the fully general office, instead, make an appearance. So\nLowe:\n\n\n\u2018Thing\u2019, in its most general sense, is interchangeable\nwith \u2018entity\u2019 or \u2018being\u2019 and is applicable to\nany item whose existence is acknowledged by a system of ontology,\nwhether that item be particular, universal, abstract, or concrete. In\nthis sense, not only material bodies but also properties, relations,\nevents, numbers, sets, and propositions are\u2014if they are\nacknowledged as existing\u2014to be accounted \u2018things\u2019.\n(2005: 915)\n\n\nAnd Russell:\n\n\nI shall use as synonymous with [\u2018term\u2019] the words unit,\nindividual and entity. The first two emphasize the fact that every\nterm is one, while the third is derived from the fact that every term\nhas being, i.e. is in some sense. A man, a moment, a number, a class,\na relation, a chimera, or anything else that can be mentioned, is sure\nto be a term (1903: 43)\n\n\nAnd Strawson:\n\n\nAnything whatever can be introduced into discussion by means of a\nsingular, definitely identifying substantival expression\u2026.\nAnything whatever can be identifyingly referred to; anything whatever\ncan appear as a logical subject, an \u2018individual\u2019. (1959:\n137, 227)\n\n\nFinally, Tugendhat:\n\n\nNow what is meant by the word \u2018object\u2019? This word too, in\nthe comprehensive sense in which it is used in philosophy, is a term\nof art. In ordinary language we are inclined to call only material\nobjects\u2026 objects, and not e.g. events or numbers\u2026 What\nis meant by \u2018objects\u2019 in philosophy has its basis in\n\u2026 what we mean by the word \u2018something\u2019\u2026\nThere is a class of linguistic expressions which are used to stand for\nan object; and here we can only say: to stand for something. These are\nthe expressions which can function as the sentence-subject in\nso-called singular predicative statements and which in logic have also\nbeen called singular terms\u2026 (1976 [1982, 21\u201323])\n\n\nAlthough they differ on which English word to assign to that category\n(i.e., \u2018thing\u2019, \u2018term\u2019, or\n\u2018individual\u2019, \u2018something\u2019), Lowe, Russell,\nStrawson, and Tugendhat all accept a fully general category under\nwhich all items fall and suppose that some word picks out that\ncategory. They accept, then, the Umbrella View.\n\nSome features of the Umbrella View deserve explicit attention.\n\nOn the Umbrella View, it is unlikely that object can be\nanalyzed in more fundamental terms or categories, especially if\nanalysis of a condition or category involves specifying the complement\nof that condition. Object is, rather, a primitive of\nsorts. Frege affirms something along these lines when he notes of\n\u2018object\u2019 that \u201ca regular definition is impossible,\nsince we have here something too simple to admit of logical\nanalysis\u201d (1891 [1960: 32]).\n\nBut it does not follow from the Umbrella View that nothing at all can\nbe said about the category object. For the above proponents\nof the Umbrella View, there is clearly a connection between being an\nobject and being a candidate for\n reference (see entry)\n or thought\u2014something that can be referred to or\nthought about (witness Russell\u2019s use of\n\u2018term\u2019 above, for example). We will discuss this\nconnection\u2014and the account of the nature of object that\nit suggests\u2014in more detail in\n \u00a73.1.\n\nFinally, note that there may be reason to be wary of any\nfully general category (whether expressed by \u2018object\u2019,\n\u2018thing\u2019, \u2018entity\u2019, or whatnot.). There may be\nreason, that is, to doubt the metaphysical conjunct of the Umbrella\nView. First and perhaps most importantly, there are paradoxes and\npuzzles associated with talking about. or \u2018quantifying\nover\u2019, literally every\n thing.[4]\n Second, any fully general category lacks a contrast or complement. So\nit may appear to be idle with respect to classification or carving or\ndividing\u2014the central theoretical tasks of categories, one might\nthink\u2014thus inviting suspicion on the grounds that it is of no\ntheoretical use.\n\nIf there are non-objects, some obvious topics to pursue include what\nthey are and what they are like. Here we may appeal to various\ndistinctions metaphysicians have offered across disparate projects.\nThese distinctions may not map precisely onto an\nobject/non-object divide and may not have been formulated explicitly\nin those terms. But they can still offer insight into what the\ncontrast or complement of object might be and in turn shed\nlight on what the category of object might amount to.\n\nWe will now survey several such distinctions; in each case there is a\npurportedly exclusive and exhaustive classification of items into two\nnon-empty categories, one of which intuitively maps onto\nobject and the other onto non-object.\n",
