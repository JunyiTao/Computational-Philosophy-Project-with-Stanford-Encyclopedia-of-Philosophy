Knowledge\n\nSuch an appreciation of Weber\u2019s main problematic, which\nculminates in the question of modern individual freedom, may help shed\nlight on some of the controversial aspects of Weber\u2019s\nmethodology. In accounting for his methodological claims, it needs to\nbe borne in mind that Weber was not at all interested in writing a\nsystematic epistemological treatise in order to put an end to the\n\u201cstrife over methods\u201d (Methodenstreit) of his\ntime between historicism and positivism. His ambition was much more\nmodest and pragmatic. Just as \u201cthe person who attempted to walk\nby constantly applying anatomical knowledge would be in danger of\nstumbling\u201d [Weber 1906/1949, 115; translation altered], so can\nmethodology be a kind of knowledge that may supply a rule of thumb,\ncodified a posteriori, for what historians and social\nscientists do, but it could never substitute for the skills they use\nin their research practice. Instead, Weber\u2019s attempt to mediate\nhistoricism and positivism was meant to aid an actual researcher make\na practical value-judgment that is fair and acceptable in the\nface of the plethora of subjective values that one encounters when\nselecting and processing historical data. After all, the questions\nthat drove his methodological reflections were what it means to\npractice science in the modern polytheistic world and how one can do\nscience with a sense of vocation. In his own words, \u201cthe\ncapacity to distinguish between empirical knowledge and\nvalue-judgments, and the fulfillment of the scientific duty to see the\nfactual truth as well as the practical duty to stand up for our own\nideals constitute the program to which we wish to adhere with ever\nincreasing firmness\u201d [Weber 1904/1949, 58]. Sheldon Wolin thus\nconcludes that Weber \u201cformulated the idea of methodology to\nserve, not simply as a guide to investigation but as a moral practice\nand a mode of political action\u201d [Wolin 1981, 414]. In short,\nWeber\u2019s methodology was as ethical as it was\nepistemological.\n",
