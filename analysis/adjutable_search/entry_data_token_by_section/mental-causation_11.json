    "main_text": "Problem II: Anomalous Monism || The Charge of Epiphenomenalism\n5.2 The Charge of Epiphenomenalism\n\nDavidson\u2019s property dualism, and the principle that lies behind\nit, have led to a serious charge: anomalous monism robs mental\nproperties of any causal significance.\n\nSuppose Gus decides to illuminate the room and subsequently flips a\nswitch, thereby turning on the light. In this case we have a cause\nthat, if Davidson is right, could be given both a mental and a\nphysical description, and an effect that has a physical description.\nIf this means that the cause has a mental property (in virtue of which\nit satisfies a mental description) and a physical property (in virtue\nof which it satisfies a physical description), we are faced with a\nfurther question. Granting that the event with the mental property\nis the event with a physical property, why should we think\nthat the mental property had anything at all to do with the\nevent\u2019s physical effect? Davidson\u2019s second two principles\nappear to block such relevance. If all causal relations are subsumed\nunder strict laws, and if there are no strict psychophysical laws,\nthen any instance of mind\u2013body causation is subsumed only by\nphysical laws. But then it looks as though only a mental event\u2019s\nphysical properties are relevant to what it causes. The mental\nproperties (or mental types) are causally irrelevant (see, e.g.,\nStoutland 1980; Honderich 1982; Sosa 1984; a review of this literature\nis in McLaughlin 1989).\n",
