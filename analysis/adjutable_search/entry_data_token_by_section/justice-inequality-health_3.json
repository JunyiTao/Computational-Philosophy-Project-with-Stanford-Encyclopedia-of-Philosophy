    "main_text": "Justice and Domestic Health Inequalities || Free-Standing Approaches\n6.2 Free-Standing Approaches\n\nWe can distinguish two fundamentally different approaches to bringing\nverdicts of fairness or justice to bear on a given health inequality.\nOn the free-standing approach, the injustice of an unjust\nhealth inequality is the primary injustice, although a verdict of\ninjustice can also be spread backwards from this primary\ninjustice to its causes. By contrast, on the derivative\napproach, the injustice of an unjust health inequality is not the\nprimary injustice. Rather, the primary injustice is some unjust cause\nof a health inequality, although a verdict of injustice can also be\nspread forwards from this primary injustice to the health\ninequality itself. In this way, the injustice of an unjust health\ninequality derives from the primary injustice of its cause(s). (This\ndistinction between free-standing and derivative approaches closely\nmatches Peter\u2019s [2004: 94\u201395] distinction between direct\nand indirect approaches). Suppose, for example, that part of the\ndifference in life expectancy between white and Black men in the\nUnited States is caused by racial discrimination. On the derivative\napproach, this part of that inequality in health is unjust because its\ncause is unjust, and this verdict holds even if inequalities\nin health are not otherwise unjust (e.g., even if no valid principle\nof equality applies directly to health). On a free-standing approach,\nby contrast, this difference in life expectancy may itself be unjust,\nregardless of its cause. We discuss each approach in turn.\n\nThe simplest example of the free-standing approach applies a general\nprinciple of equality directly to the case of health. (For general\ndiscussion of the grounds of egalitarianism, as well as of the\ncharacter of different versions, see the entry on\n egalitarianism.)\n With some qualifications, the resultant requirement of\n\u201cequality of health\u201d is affirmed, for example, by Anthony\nCulyer and Adam Wagstaff (1993). This implies that any\navoidable inequality in health is unfair or unjust.\n\nLuck egalitarians object to the strict equality view on the grounds\nthat inequalities are not unjust if they are the result of voluntary\nand informed choices (Segall 2010; Le Grand 1987). While it is unjust\nfor one person to be worse off than another because of brute\nluck\u2014i.e., factors beyond a person\u2019s control such as their\nnatural or social circumstances\u2014inequalities due to\noption luck\u2014i.e., factors within a person\u2019s\ncontrol\u2014are just. For luck egalitarians therefore, not all\nhealth inequalities are unjust, only those due to unchosen\ncircumstances (Voorhoeve 2019; Albertsen & Knight 2015; Temkin\n2013; Segall 2010: 99).\n\nA problem for both strict and luck egalitarian views, however, is that\nthey are subject to the leveling down objection, for unjust\ninequalities in health may be addressed either by improving the health\nof those who are unfairly worse off or leveling down the health of\nthose who are unfairly better off (Segall 2010). If A\u2019s\nlife expectancy is 10 years shorter than B\u2019s due to\ncancer, this inequality may be addressed either by treating\nA\u2019s cancer or damaging B\u2019s health.\nSimilarly, if one holds that health inequalities between social groups\nare unjust, one may be committed to the conclusion that deteriorations\nin the health of members of advantaged social groups are good\u2014at\nleast in one respect\u2014when they reduce such inequalities. For\nexample, one may be committed to the questionable claim that the rise\nof \u201cdeaths of despair\u201d among white Americans in the\ntwenty-first century (see Case & Deaton 2015, 2020) is in one\nrespect good since it reduced inequalities in life expectancy among\nwhite Americans and Black Americans (for a thoughtful discussion of\nthis issue, see Blacksher 2018).\n\nEyal (2013) offers the most promising response to the leveling down\nobjection in this context, pointing to a number of cases where it is\nplausible to prefer outcomes that are more equal, even if less equal\nalternatives are available where some are better off and no one is\nworse off. Luck egalitarians also soften the force of this objection\nby adopting pluralist views, arguing that comparative fairness is not\nthe only relevant value (see Voorhoeve 2019; Temkin 2013).\n\nSegall (2010) opts instead for a luck prioritarian account,\nprioritizing the opportunity for health of the worse off.\nAccording to this principle,\n\n\nFairness requires giving priority to improving the health of an\nindividual if she has invested more rather than less effort in looking\nafter her health, and of any two individuals who have invested equal\namounts of effort, giving priority to those who are worse off\n(health-wise). (Segall 2010: 112)\n\n\nOn Segall\u2019s (2010: 119), view therefore, justice demands, first,\nthat we improve the health of those who have been most prudent in\ntaking care of their health, that is, whose health deficits are most\ndue to brute luck. For individuals who have exercised equal prudence\nregarding their health, justice demands, second, that priority be\ngiven to those whose health deficit is greatest\u2014i.e., are worse\noff (Segall 2010: 119). In contrast to a luck egalitarian view,\nSegall\u2019s (2010: 120) luck prioritarian view is not concerned\nwith realizing equality in health, but rather with \u201cprioritizing\nthe opportunity for health of the worse off\u201d.\n\nSome scholars avoid the leveling down objection by opting for social\nor relational egalitarian alternatives to luck egalitarianism. On this\nview, health inequalities are unjust if they undermine citizens\u2019\nability to interact with each other as equals (see Voorhoeve 2019;\nKelleher 2016; Voigt & Wester 2015; Hausman 2012; Pogge 2004). For\nexample, Alex Voorhoeve (2019) suggests that social egalitarians have\nspecial reason to be concerned with health deficits that make people\nvulnerable to domination or exploitation in private life as well as\ndomination or marginalization in public life. Proponents of this view\nargue that it addresses a significant problem with luck egalitarian\napproaches since it holds that health inequalities due to\npeople\u2019s voluntary and informed choices are nonetheless unjust\nif they undermine their standing as equals. A challenge to social or\nrelational egalitarian views, however, is that they are vague on which\nhealth inequalities undermine equal relations among citizens (Hausman\n2019; Voigt & Wester 2015).\n\nIn contrast to those who see luck egalitarian and relational\napproaches as competing views, Voorhoeve (2019) argues that each has a\ncompelling basis and may be combined in a complementary way. Social or\nrelational egalitarianism recognizes that there is \u201creason to be\naverse to choice-based inequalities that threaten people\u2019s\nstatus as equal citizens\u201d while the luck egalitarian approach\noffers a reasonable interpretation of the vague relational requirement\nof the principle of equal consideration (Voorhoeve 2019:\n154\u2013155).\n\nOthers avoid the leveling down objection by defending sufficientarian\napproaches to health justice (for comprehensive discussions of\nsufficientarian approaches, see Fourie 2016; Rid 2016). Madison Powers\nand Ruth Faden (2006: 15\u201329) argue that social justice requires\nthat people be secured a sufficient level of wellbeing where wellbeing\nis understood to have six essential dimensions: health, personal\nsecurity, reasoning, respect, attachment, and self-determination.\nJustice does not therefore demand equality in health outcomes, but\nrather that people have \u201cenough health over a long enough life\nspan to live a decent life\u201d (Powers & Faden 2006: 95).\nJennifer Prah Ruger (2010) similarly develops a capabilities approach\nto health justice, according to which people are entitled to a\nthreshold level of certain core health capabilities, that is,\nabilities to be healthy. The focus of public policy, Prah Ruger (2010:\n88\u201390) argues, should be to reduce \u201cshortfall\u201d\ninequalities\u2014i.e., to bring people as close to the requisite\nthreshold as is possible.\n\nWhile these sufficientarian approaches avoid the leveling down\nobjection, they nonetheless face two significant challenges. First,\nshould governments be indifferent regarding health disparities above\nthe threshold identified by sufficientarian views (Arneson 2002)? If\nthe threshold is set too low, such a view may regard significant\ndisparities in morbidity and mortality as not unjust. Second, among\nthose who fall below the threshold, who should be prioritized (Fourie\n2016)? Should policymakers focus on maximizing the number of people\nwho meet the threshold, even if this means helping those who are\nbetter off? Or should they prioritize the worse off, even if this\nmeans using significant resources to only marginally improve their\nhealth? (For a discussion of possible solutions to these problems, see\nShields 2016).\n\nSome commentators criticize free-standing views\u2019 tendency to\nfocus on or prioritize health inequalities to the exclusion\nof other normative considerations. Hausman (2007, 2013, 2019) argues\nthat health inequalities among individuals are not pro tanto unjust\nsince such inequalities (among individuals) do not permit inferences\nregarding inequalities in wellbeing or moral standing which are of\nreal moral concern. Daniel Weinstock (2015: 438) cautions against\n\u201chealth consequentialism\u201d, the view that all social\ndeterminants of health should be arranged to achieve some preferred\ndistribution of health\u2014e.g., health equality. He argues instead\nin favor of pluralistic approaches to distributive justice which\nrecognize that the distribution of many of the social determinants of\nhealth\u2014e.g., income and education\u2014should also be governed\nby additional, non-health related principles of justice (see also\nWester 2018). Powers and Faden\u2019s (2006) view avoids these\nproblems by positing six dimensions of wellbeing, though this approach\nfaces the challenge of how conflicts among these dimensions ought to\nbe adjudicated.\n",
