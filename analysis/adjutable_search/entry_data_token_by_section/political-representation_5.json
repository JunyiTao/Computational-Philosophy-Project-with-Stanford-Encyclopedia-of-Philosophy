    "main_text": "Contemporary Advances\n4. Future Areas of Study\n\nThere are three persistent problems associated with political\nrepresentation. Each of these problems identifies a future area of\ninvestigation. The first problem is the proper institutional design\nfor representative institutions within democratic polities. The\ntheoretical literature on political representation has paid a lot of\nattention to the institutional design of democracies. More\nspecifically, political theorists have recommended everything from\nproportional representation (e.g. Guinier, 1994 and Christiano, 1996)\nto citizen juries (Fishkin, 1995). However, with the growing number of\ndemocratic states, we are likely to witness more variation among the\ndifferent forms of political representation. In particular, it is\nimportant to be aware of how non-democratic and hybrid regimes can\nadopt representative institutions to consolidate their power over\ntheir citizens. There is likely to be much debate about the advantages\nand disadvantages of adopting representative institutions.\n\nThis leads to a second future line of inquiry \u2014 ways in which\ndemocratic citizens can be marginalized by representative\ninstitutions. This problem is articulated most clearly by\nYoung\u2019s discussion of the difficulties arising from one person\nrepresenting many. Young suggests that representative institutions can\ninclude the opinions, perspectives and interests of some citizens at\nthe expense of marginalizing the opinions, perspectives and interests\nof others. Hence, a problem with institutional reforms aimed at\nincreasing the representation of historically disadvantaged groups is\nthat such reforms can and often do decrease the responsiveness of\nrepresentatives. For instance, the creation of black districts has\ncreated safe zones for black elected officials so that they are less\naccountable to their constituents. Any decrease in accountability is\nespecially worrisome given the ways citizens are vulnerable to their\nrepresentatives. Thus, one future line of research is examining the\nways that representative institutions marginalize the interests,\nopinions and perspectives of democratic citizens.\n\nIn particular, it is necessary for to acknowledge the biases of\nrepresentative institutions. While E. E. Schattschneider (1960) has\nlong noted the class bias of representative institutions, there is\nlittle discussion of how to improve the political representation of\nthe disaffected \u2014 that is, the political representation of those\ncitizens who do not have the will, the time, or political resources to\nparticipate in politics. The absence of such a discussion is\nparticularly apparent in the literature on descriptive representation,\nthe area that is most concerned with disadvantaged citizens. Anne\nPhillips (1995) raises the problems with the representation of the\npoor, e.g. the inability to define class, however, she argues for\nissues of class to be integrated into a politics of presence. Few\ntheorists have taken up Phillip\u2019s gauntlet and articulated how\nthis integration of class and a politics of presence is to be done. Of\ncourse, some have recognized the ways in which interest groups,\nassociations, and individual representatives can betray the least well\noff (e.g. Strolovitch, 2004). And some (Dovi, 2003) have argued that\ndescriptive representatives need to be selected based on their\nrelationship to citizens who have been unjustly excluded and\nmarginalized by democratic politics. However, it is unclear how to\ncounteract the class bias that pervades domestic and international\nrepresentative institutions. It is necessary to specify the conditions\nunder which certain groups within a democratic polity require enhanced\nrepresentation. Recent empirical literature has suggested that the\nbenefits of having descriptive representatives is by no means\nstraightforward (Gay, 2002).\n\nA third and final area of research involves the relationship between\nrepresentation and democracy. Historically, representation was\nconsidered to be in opposition with democracy [See\nDahl (1989) for a historical overview of the concept of\nrepresentation]. When compared to the direct forms of democracy found\nin the ancient city-states, notably Athens, representative\ninstitutions appear to be poor substitutes for the ways that citizens\nactively ruled themselves. Barber (1984) has famously argued that\nrepresentative institutions were opposed to strong democracy. In\ncontrast, almost everyone now agrees that democratic political\ninstitutions are representative ones.\n\nBernard Manin (1997)reminds us that the Athenian Assembly, which often\nexemplifies direct forms of democracy, had only limited powers.\nAccording to Manin, the practice of selecting magistrates by lottery\nis what separates representative democracies from so-called direct\ndemocracies. Consequently, Manin argues that the methods of selecting\npublic officials are crucial to understanding what makes\nrepresentative governments democratic. He identifies four principles\ndistinctive of representative government: 1) Those who govern are\nappointed by election at regular intervals; 2) The decision-making of\nthose who govern retains a degree of independence from the wishes of\nthe electorate; 3) Those who are governed may give expression to their\nopinions and political wishes without these being subject to the\ncontrol of those who govern; and 4) Public decisions undergo the trial\nof debate (6). For Manin, historical democratic practices hold\nimportant lessons for determining whether representative institutions\nare democratic.\n\nWhile it is clear that representative institutions are vital\ninstitutional components of democratic institutions, much more needs\nto be said about the meaning of democratic representation. In\nparticular, it is important not to presume that all acts of\nrepresentation are equally democratic. After all, not all acts of\nrepresentation within a representative democracy are necessarily\ninstances of democratic representation. Henry Richardson (2002) has\nexplored the undemocratic ways that members of the bureaucracy can\nrepresent citizens. [For a more detailed discussion of non-democratic\nforms of representation, see Apter (1968). Michael Saward (2008) also\ndiscusses how existing systems of political representation do not\nnecessarily serve democracy.] Similarly, it is unclear whether a\nrepresentative who actively seeks to dismantle democratic institutions\nis representing democratically. Does democratic representation require\nrepresentatives to advance the preferences of democratic citizens or\ndoes it require a commitment to democratic institutions? At this\npoint, answers to such questions are unclear. What is certain is that\ndemocratic citizens are likely to disagree about what constitutes\ndemocratic representation.\n\nOne popular approach to addressing the different and conflicting\nstandards used to evaluate representatives within democratic polities,\nis to simply equate multiple standards with democratic ones. More\nspecifically, it is argued that democratic standards are pluralistic,\naccommodating the different standards possessed and used by democratic\ncitizens. Theorists who adopt this approach fail to specify the proper\nrelationship among these standards. For instance, it is unclear how\nthe standards that Mansbridge identifies in the four different forms\nof representation should relate to each other. Does it matter if\npromissory forms of representation are replaced by surrogate forms of\nrepresentation? A similar omission can be found in Pitkin: although\nPitkin specifies there is a unified relationship among the different\nviews of representation, she never describes how the different views\ninteract. This omission reflects the lacunae in the literature about\nhow formalistic representation relates to descriptive and substantive\nrepresentation. Without such a specification, it is not apparent how\ncitizens can determine if they have adequate powers of authorization\nand accountability.\n\nCurrently, it is not clear exactly what makes any given form of\nrepresentation consistent, let alone consonant, with democratic\nrepresentation. Is it the synergy among different forms or should we\nexamine descriptive representation in isolation to determine the ways\nthat it can undermine or enhance democratic representation? One\ntendency is to equate democratic representation simply with the\nexistence of fluid and multiple standards. While it is true that the\nfact of pluralism provides justification for democratic institutions\nas Christiano (1996) has argued, it should no longer presumed that all\nforms of representation are democratic since the actions of\nrepresentatives can be used to dissolve or weaken democratic\ninstitutions. The final research area is to articulate the\nrelationship between different forms of representation and ways that\nthese forms can undermine democratic representation.\n",
