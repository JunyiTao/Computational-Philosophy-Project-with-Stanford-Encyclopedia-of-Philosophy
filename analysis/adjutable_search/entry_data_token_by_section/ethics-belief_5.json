Value monists in the\nethics of belief argue that only one type of value (usually some kind\nof epistemic value) can generate such norms. A prominent kind of\nmonism, often called \u201cveritism\u201d, says that truth is the\nfundamental doxastic good: its value is not grounded in knowledge or\nanything else (see Pritchard 2011, Gardiner 2012, Ahlstrom-Vij\n2013).\n\nOther more permissive accounts go beyond the three types of value\nconsidered above\u2014prudential, moral, and epistemic\u2014to\nsuggest that there are other types that can generate doxastic\nobligations as well. Perhaps there are aesthetic norms that\nguide us to beliefs that have some sort of aesthetic merit, or that\nmake us qua subjects more beautiful in virtue of believing them. There\nmay also be social norms that govern beliefs we form in our\nvarious communal roles (as lawyers, priests, psychiatrists, friends,\nparents, etc. (regarding the doxastic obligations of friends, see\nKeller 2004, Stroud 2006, and Aikin 2008)) and political\nnorms that govern beliefs we form as citizens, subjects, voters, and\nso on (here see the second half of Matheson and Vitz 2014). \n\nIt's an interesting and open question whether such aesthetic, social,\nor political norms could be cashed out in terms of epistemic, moral,\nand prudential norms (e.g. perhaps being someone's lawyer or being\nsomeone's friend underwrites certain moral or\nprudential norms of belief regarding his or her innocence).\nIn any case, the three types of underlying value considered above are\nthe ones most frequently discussed under the rubric of the\n\u201cethics of belief.\u201d\n\nNorms, and types of norms, can be related in different ways. According\nto the interpretation of Clifford presented above, there is a strong\nconnection between the epistemic and the moral types: the fact that\nthere is an epistemic norm to believe always and only on sufficient\nevidence entails that there is an analogous moral norm. The\nreasoning here seems to be as follows:\n\n\n(P1) We have an epistemic obligation to possess\nsufficient evidence for all of our beliefs;\n\n(P2) We have a moral obligation to uphold our\nepistemic obligations;\n\n(C) Thus, we have a moral obligation to possess\nsufficient evidence for all of our beliefs.\n\n\nThis formulation keeps the types of values distinct while still\nforging a link between them in the form of (P2). But of course we\nwould need to find a sound sub-argument in favor of (P2) (see\nDougherty 2014).\n\nIn some places, Clifford seems simply to presume that epistemic duty\nis a species of ethical duty. That would make sense of why he thinks\nit just obvious that the shipowner is \u201cequally\nguilty\u201d\u2014regardless of whether the ship sinks. Elsewhere\nClifford defends (P2) by reference to our need to rely on the\ntestimony of others in order to avoid significant harm and advance\nscientific progress. No belief is without effect, he claims: at the\nvery least, believing on insufficient evidence (even with respect to\nan apparently very insignificant issue) is liable to lead to the\nlowering of epistemic standards in other more important contexts too.\nAnd that could, in turn, have bad moral consequences.\n\nElsewhere still Clifford seems not to recognize a distinction between\nepistemic and moral obligations at all (see Van Inwagen 1996, Haack\n1997, Wood 2002, and Zamulinski 2002 for further discussion of\nClifford on this issue).\n\nIt was noted earlier that one way to read Locke is as arguing for (P2)\nvia the independent theoretical premise that God's will for us is that\nwe follow Evidentialist norms, together with a divine command theory\nof moral rightness (see Wolterstorff 1996). But Locke can also be read\nas primarily interested in defending (P1) rather than (P2) or (C) (see\nBrandt Bolton 2009).\n\nA virtue-theoretic approach, by contrast, might defend (P2) by\nclaiming not that a particular unjustified belief causes moral harm,\nbut rather that regularly ignoring our epistemic obligations is a bad\nintellectual habit, and that having a bad intellectual habits is a way\nof having a bad moral character (Zagzebski 1996, Roberts and Wood\n2007).\n\nIn addition to using theoretical arguments like these, ethicists of\nbelief can connect doxastic norms by appealing to empirical data. If\nwe discover through investigation that it is on the whole prudent to\nbe morally good, then prudential norms may be able support some of the\nmoral norms. Similarly, if we discover that following moral norms of\nbelief reliably leads to the acquisition of knowledge, then there may\nbe a track-record argument that goes from epistemic norms to moral\nnorms (this would effectively be an empirical argument in support of\n(P2) above). And if we empirically find that adhering to epistemic\nnorms also promotes the moral good, then there will be an argument\nfrom the moral to the epistemic. \n\nFinally, norms and types of norms can be in outright tension. The\nprudential norm recommending belief that your son is not smoking pot\nwhen you're gone conflicts with the epistemic norm to follow your\nperceptual evidence. Likewise, the moral norm to believe the best of\nothers is often tragically in tension with the epistemic norm to\nbelieve what the evidence supports, with the prudential norm to\nbelieve whatever it takes in order to get ahead, and so on.\n\nTension or conflict can also exist between doxastic obligations of a\ndiachronic sort. The epistemic norm to gather as much evidence as\npossible may conflict with the prudential norm to believe in such a\nway as to save time and effort (example: the fastidious boss who never\nhires anyone until he has investigated a candidate's entire past,\ncalled every reference, and confirmed every qualification). It also\nconflicts with the moral norm not to believe on the basis of evidence\ngathered in an immoral fashion (example: the doctor who gathers\nevidence about human diseases by performing inhumane experiments on\nprisoners).\n\nEthicists of belief who are not value monists often claim that there\nis a way of ordering norms or types of norms in terms of the relative\nstrength or relative ease with which their claims on us can be\ndefeated. This means that in a given situation there will be a\ndeterminate answer about what one ought to believe \u201call things\nconsidered.\u201d Others argue, however, that at least some of the\nnorms are incommensurable, and that in many cases there will simply be\nno answer to the question of what it is right to believe all things\nconsidered (Feldman 2000). Still others think that one category of\nnorm collapses into another and that this can give us an all things\nconsidered conclusion (for discussion of whether epistemic rationality\ncollapses into prudential rationality, for example, see Kelly\n2003)\n\nIn sum: a full-blown ethics of belief will say something about the\naxiological sources of the different types of norms, about the\ninferential relations between them, about their temporal range\n(synchronic/diachronic) and about what to do when norms conflict.
