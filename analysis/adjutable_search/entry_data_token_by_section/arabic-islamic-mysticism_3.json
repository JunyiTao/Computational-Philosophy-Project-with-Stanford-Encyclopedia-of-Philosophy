    "main_text": "The School of Isfahan and Mulla Sadra\n4. The School of Isfahan and Mulla Sadra\n\nBack in Persia, came the advent of the Safavid dynasty in the\n16th century CE, the founders of which were practicing\nSufis affiliated with the grand Sufi master, \u1e62af\u012b\nal-D\u012bn Ardab\u012bl\u012b (1252\u20131334 CE). There the use of\nSufi doctrine, philosophy, and asceticism within a single\nphilosophical paradigm reached its pinnacle. The most important issue\nof what came to be called the \u201cSchool of Isfahan\u201d was the\n\u201creality of being\u201d (\u1e25aqiqat\nal-w\u016bj\u016bd ) as opposed to the \u201cconcept of\nbeing\u201d (mafh\u016bm al-w\u016bj\u016bd).\n\nThe founder of the School of Isfahan, M\u012br D\u0101m\u0101d (d.\n1631 or 1632 CE), was a follower of Suhraward\u012b\u2019s philosophy\nof illumination, even choosing the pen name ishr\u0101q\n(illumination). He not only wrote extensively on the metaphysical\nfoundation of mysticism in his major work Sparks of Fire\n(al-Qabas\u0101t), and in his Ecstasies\n(Al-Jadhaw\u0101t), Heavenly Mystical States\n(Khalsat al-malak\u016bt), and his Disassociations\n(al-Khl\u2018iyy\u0101t), he also wrote mystical poetry.\nEven though M\u012br D\u0101m\u0101d wrote extensively on peripatetic\nphilosophy, and especially the concept of time, he is to be credited\nwith a gnostic interpretation of Avicennan philosophy. His\nphilosophico-mystical structure, based on the principality of essence,\nprovides the intellectual frame work for the ascendance of the soul\nand its eventual unity with its source.\n\nIt was however, his student \u1e62adr al-D\u012bn Shir\u0101z\u012b,\nknown as Mull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101, who is perhaps the greatest\nmetaphysician of the Islamic philosophical tradition. His grand\nsynthesis of discursive philosophy, intellectual intuition, and\nasceticism came to be known as the \u201cTranscendental\nTheo-Sophy\u201d (al-\u1e25ikmat\nal-muta\u2018\u0101liyah). This philosophical perspective,\naccording to Mull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101, was unveiled to him by God\nafter many years of inner purification. With Mull\u0101\n\u1e62adr\u0101, an attempt to offer a spiritual commentary\n(ta\u2019w\u012bl) from a Shi\u2018ite gnostic perspective\non the Qur\u2019an and the concept of \u201cspiritual\nguardianship\u201d (wil\u0101yah) reaches its pinnacle.\n\nHis magnum opus, The Four Journeys of the Intellect\n(al-Asf\u0101r al-arba\u2018\u0101t al-\u2018aqliyyah) is a\nphilosophical and gnostic exposition of the highest caliber, in which\nthe descending and ascending journey of the soul from and to God is\ntreated in detail. This work, which is an encyclopedia of gnosis,\nphilosophy, and mysticism, incorporates much of what Ibn\n\u2018Arab\u012b and other philosopher-mystics had brought forth to\ndate. For Mull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101, creation represents four\njourneys: the Fall, in which unity becomes multiplicity is the first,\nfollowed by one\u2019s earthly journey wherein the pain of separation\ncauses an existential yearning towards one\u2019s original abode.\nAccording to Mull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101, man\u2019s spiritual\nascendance through the path of Sufism and gnosticism constitutes the\nthird part of this journey until unity once again is accomplished.\nFinally there is the sojourn in the Divine realm, from Truth\n(\u1e25aqq) to Truth, a station only few of the spiritual\nelites may ever experience.\n\nMull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101 can be regarded as the reviver of the\nauthentic mystical wisdom to be attained through mysticism and the\nintellectual intuition not divorced from rationality. Mull\u0101\n\u1e62adr\u0101 makes extensive use of logical analyses and\ndemonstrative proofs, which rest on what he calls \u201cilluminative\nprinciple\u201d (q\u0101\u2018idah ishraqiyyah); that is,\nwhat has entered the heart (al-varid\u0101t al-qalbiyyah), or\n\u201cDivinely realized knowledge\u201d (ta\u1e25q\u012bq\n\u2018arsh\u012b).\n\nSome works that are indicative of his commitment to philosophical\nmysticism are, Metaphysical Penetrations\n(al-Mash\u0101ri\u2018), Wisdom of the Throne\n(\u1e24ikmat al-\u2018arshiyah), The Unity of the\nKnower and the Known (Itti\u1e25\u0101d al-\u2018\u0101qil\nwa\u2019l-ma\u2018q\u016bl), and Secrets of the\nQur\u2019anic Verses (Asr\u0101r al-\u0101y\u0101t), a\ngnostic commentary on the famous light verses.\n\nMull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101 left an indelible mark upon Islamic\nphilosophy, and especially on the nexus between philosophy and\nmysticism, making the integration of mysticism an assumed part of\nphilosophizing. His students carried out his philosophical legacy well\ninto the modern era. \u2018Abd al-Razz\u0101q L\u0101hij\u012b (d.\n1661\u20131662 CE) wrote a commentary upon The Secrets of the\nGarden (Shar\u1e25-i gulshan-i r\u0101z), which is a\ndetailed exposition of the spiritual path and one\u2019s journey\nthrough the maze of the states and stations of the Sufi path, M\u012br\nFindirisk\u012b (d. 1640\u201341 CE) wrote a mystical commentary upon\nYoga Vaishishe, and Mull\u0101 Mu\u1e25sin Fay\u1e0d\nK\u0101sh\u0101n\u012b (d. 1680 CE) wrote a mystical treatise entitled\nThe Hidden Words (Kalim\u0101t-i maknunah) as well\nas Divine Gnosis (al-Ma\u2018\u0101rif\nal-il\u0101hiyyah). Q\u0101\u1e0d\u012b Sa\u2018id Qumm\u012b\n(d. 1696 CE), another student of Mull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101 and a\nstanch Neoplatonist authored a number of mystical treatises such as\nthe Secrets of Worships (Asr\u0101r\nal-\u2018ib\u0101d\u0101t) as well as a major gnostic work\ntitled Commentary Upon The Enneads (Ta\u2018liq\u0101t\nbar Uth\u016bl\u016bjiy\u0101), scil. The pseudo-Aristotelian\nTheology of Aristotle, derived from the Enneads of\nPlotinus. (See infra The Theology of Aristotle by Peter\nAdamson.)\n\nThe above works, all of which are continuations of \u1e62adrian\nphilosophy, further elaborate the fine points of transcendentalist\ntheo-sophy, which was firmly based on the principality of existence\nover essence, gradation, and the oneness that appears as multiplicity.\nThe question is how to transcend the world of objects which appears as\nmany, to see the Oneness which lies at the heart of multiplicity. The\npost Suhraward\u012ban and Sadrian answer is that a combination of\npractical wisdom and intellectual intuition which transcends\ndiscursive reasoning, provides one with the vision to see the Oneness\nlying at the heart of multiplicity.\n",
