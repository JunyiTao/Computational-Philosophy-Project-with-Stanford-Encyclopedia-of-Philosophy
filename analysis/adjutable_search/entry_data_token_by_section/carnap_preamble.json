    "main_text": "\n\nRudolf Carnap (1891\u20131970) was one of the best-known philosophers\nof the twentieth century. Notorious as one of the founders, and\nperhaps the leading philosophical representative, of the movement\nknown as logical positivism or logical empiricism, he was one of the\noriginators of the new field of philosophy of science and later a\nleading contributor to semantics and inductive logic. Though his views\nunderwent significant changes at various points, he continued to\nreaffirm the basic tenets of logical empiricism, and is still\nidentified with it. His influence declined, therefore, when logical\nempiricism lost its dominance in the 1950s and 60s, even though many\nof the efforts of the next philosophical generation (such as\nQuine\u2019s) may be understood as responses to Carnap. Beginning in\nthe 1980s, a reassessment set in that has resulted in a much more\nnuanced and complex picture of his philosophy and its development. The\nliterature on him is now enormous and still growing rapidly, and his\nideas are presently enjoying a major revival in various areas of\nphilosophy.\n",
