    "main_text": "Methodological Challenges || Reproducibility\n3.5 Reproducibility\n\nIn psychology, reproducibility and replication typically refer to\nredoing an experiment to assess its reliability. If a study is\nreliable, then running the study again should produce the same\nresults. If a replication fails, then this may mean that the original\nresult was a product of measurement error, sampling error, imprecise\nmanipulation, questionable research practices, or other factors (for\nan overview, see Romero (2019) and the entry on\n reproducibility of scientific results).\n Efforts to replicate studies have increased over the past two decades\nacross a wide range of fields, including medicine, computer science,\nand psychology (Bohannon 2014). This has led to what some describe as\na \u201creplication crisis\u201d because a surprising number of\nstudies have failed to replicate. For example, an effort to replicate\n100 studies by 270 psychologists as part of the Open Science\nCollaboration found that only 38% of the original results were\nreproduced unambiguously, with some attempted replications finding an\neffect opposite to that of the original study (Bohannon 2015).\nFindings such as these have led researchers to ask whether comparative\ncognition also suffers from a replication crisis, and if so, what can\nbe done to improve the field (Brecht et al. 2021). In a recent survey,\nfor example, comparative cognition researchers were asked their views\non replications (Farrar, Ostoji\u0107, & Clayton 2021). Out of 210\nrespondents, the majority agreed (34.8%) or strongly agreed (54.8%)\nthat replications are important to perform in animal cognition\nresearch. The majority also disagreed (55.5%) or strongly disagreed\n(23.6%) that enough replications were already performed in the\nfield.\n\nDespite the above survey results, comparative cognition has been\ndescribed as \u201can absolute beacon for replication efforts\u201d\n(Beran 2018: 2). Beran (2018) notes that a standard in the field has\nbeen to conduct a series of experiments with the first experiment\nconsisting of a replication of the study that inspired the work and\nsubsequent experiments dedicated to extending that experiment (2018:\n2). Halina (2021a) also argues that replications in comparative\ncognition are common. She adopts Edouard Machery\u2019s resampling\naccount of replication (Machery 2020), showing how under this view\nsuccessful replications occur frequently in areas such as chimpanzee\ntheory of mind research. If replication success were a clear indicator\nof reliability, then this would be good news for comparative\ncognition. The picture is however complicated by several factors.\nFirst, failed replications are difficult to interpret. Often a\nreplication study will differ from the original study in several\nrespects: in such cases, it is possible to attribute failure to these\ndifferences (what Cola\u00e7o, Bickle, and Walters (2022) refer to\nas \u201cmismatch explanations\u201d). In chimpanzee theory of mind\nresearch, for example, failed replications have regularly been\nexplained by appealing to changes in the experimental setting (Halina\n2021a). As we saw in\n section 3.3,\n revisions to background assumptions are an important part of science.\nHowever, such revisions mean that failed replications are often not\ninterpreted as undermining reliability (Nosek, Spies, & Motyl\n2012). As Alexandria Boyle (2021) argues, for this and other reasons,\nreplications in comparative cognition are\n\n\npoorly placed to deliver clear judgments about the reliability of\ncomparative cognition\u2019s methods or its scientific bona fides.\n(2021: 296, see also Feest 2019)\n\n\nAnother factor complicating the picture is the \u201cfile-drawer\nproblem\u201d, which refers to the phenomenon that studies that fail\nto find statistically significant results may be relegated to the file\ndrawer (i.e., not published or communicated to the larger scientific\ncommunity). In the survey cited above, comparative cognition\nresearchers were also asked \u201cWhat percent of the studies that\nyou have performed have been published and/or you think will be\npublished?\u201d (Farrar, Ostoji\u0107, & Clayton 2021). The\nmedian response was 80% with a large spread (out of 210 responses, 23\nsaid that they published 50% or fewer of their studies, while 17\nreported publishing all their studies). Twenty-nine respondents cited\nnegative or uninteresting results as the reason for not publishing\n(2021: 18). The file-drawer problem combined with mismatch\nexplanations of failed replications may create an impression of\nreliability via the reporting of many successful replications when in\nfact the record is mixed.\n\nIf replications on their own are not a route to more robust research,\nwhat else could help? Beran (2018) emphasizes the importance of\npre-registration. Pre-registration involves publishing the methods and\nstatistical analyses that one will use in a study before data\ncollection. This prevents one from adjusting or\n\u201cmassaging\u201d elements of the experimental design and data\nanalyses with the aim of getting a positive result. Farrar, Voudouris,\nand Clayton (2021) also advance several methods that comparative\ncognition researchers could use to assess the reliability of small\nsample research, such as statistically modeling variation. More\nbroadly, Felipe Romero (2020) argues that major changes to scientific\nincentive structures are needed: in particular, a shift away from\nrewarding novelty and towards rewarding replication and confirmation\nwork. Along these lines, Brecht et al. (2021) note that while there\nare still many disincentives to conducting replication studies in\ncomparative cognition, the field is working towards improving this.\nFor example, the journal Animal Behavior and Cognition has\ncommitted to publishing pre-registered studies (including\nreplications) regardless of the results. In addition, several new\nglobal consortiums (such as ManyPrimates, ManyBirds, and ManyDogs)\nhave formed with the explicit aim of assessing reliability,\nencouraging transparency, supporting large collaborations, and\nfostering other open science practices (see\n Other Internet Resources).\n",
