    "main_text": "Combating conceptual conservativism: Paul Feyerabend on incommensurability || Feyerabend\u2019s later notion of incommensurability\n4. A comparison of Kuhn and Feyerabend on incommensurability\n\nInitially, Feyerabend had a more concrete characterization of the\nnature and origins of incommensurability than Kuhn. On\nFeyerabend\u2019s view, because the nature of objects depends on the\nmost advanced theories about them, and because the meaning of\nobservation statements depends on the nature of those objects, the\ninterpretation of an observation language is determined by the\ntheories we use to explain what we observe. Kuhn, by contrast, was\ninitially much less sure about the exact meaning of his notion of\nincommensurability, especially regarding world change, which he saw as\nthe most fundamental aspect of incommensurability. Kuhn frankly\nconfessed to have been at a loss: \u201cIn a sense that I am unable\nto explicate further, the proponents of competing paradigms practice\ntheir trades in different worlds\u201d (1962, 150). He suggested that\n\u201cwe must learn to make sense of statements that at least\nresemble these\u201d (1962, 121), and then spent a great deal of\neffort attempting to do so.\n\nFurthermore, Feyerabend\u2019s concept of incommensurability of\nscientific theories was much more restricted than Kuhn\u2019s. For\nKuhn, incommensurability had three prima facie heterogeneous\ndomains, holistically bound: a change of problems and standards, a\nchange of concepts used to state and solve them, and a change of\nworld-view in which they arise. Feyerabend\u2019s focus, on the other\nhand, was initially exclusively on concepts occurring in universal or\nfundamental theories, together with their ontological implications.\nIronically, however, in developments after 1962, both authors move in\nopposite directions. Kuhn gradually eliminated everything from his\nnotion of incommensurability that does not concern scientific\nconcepts, and ended more or less where Feyerabend began (see Carrier\n2001; Chen 1997; Hoyningen-Huene 1990, 487-488; Hoyningen-Huene 1993,\n212-218; Hoyningen-Huene 2004, Sankey 1993; Sankey 1994, 16-30; Sankey\n1997). Feyerabend, by contrast, increasingly emphasized aspects of\nperceptual change (1975, 225\u2013229, 273\u2013274; 1978, 68; 1988,\n172\u2013176), and also changes to the set of legitimate problems a\ndiscipline should handle (1975, 274\u2013275), and his later\nphilosophy emphasizes one of Kuhn\u2019s original points; the role of\nnon-binding, epistemic values in theory choice (cf. Farrell 2003).\n\nWith respect to the range of theories that are subject to\nincommensurability, Feyerabend\u2019s concept is again much more\nrestricted than Kuhn\u2019s. For Feyerabend, only universal,\nfundamental, non-instantial theories that are\ninterpreted realistically can be incommensurable (Feyerabend\n1962, 44; 1965b, 216; 1975, 114, 271, 284; 1975, 221\u2013222; 1987,\n272). Feyerabend was interested in fundamental, universal theories\nthat apply to everything, because he believed that only \u201csuch\ncomprehensive structures of thought\u201d have ontological\nimplications that are capable of sustaining entire worldviews\n(Feyerabend 1962, 28; cf. Feyerabend 1954 and Oberheim 2006, 157ff.).\nHe restricted incommensurability to non-instantial theories, which he\ndistinguished from empirical generalizations, on the basis of the\ndifferences in their test procedures. Generalizations of the form\n\u2018All As are Bs\u2019 (regardless of whether the\nAs or Bs are observable) are tested by inspecting\ninstances. So for example, Kepler\u2019s first law makes claims about\nthe planets, which can be tested directly by inspecting their motion.\nIn order to test non-instantial theories, such as Newton\u2019s\ntheory of gravitation, first empirical generalizations must be derived\nfrom them with the help of auxiliary hypothesis, and only thereafter\ncan they be tested by inspection (Feyerabend 1962, 28). Due to these\nrestrictions (only universal, fundamental, non-instantial theories),\nfor Feyerabend, incommensurability of scientific theories occurs\ncomparatively rarely (1987, 272). Kuhn included a wider range of\ntheories as candidates for incommensurability. For him, even smaller\nepisodes, like unexpected discoveries, might be incommensurable with\nthe earlier tradition (cf. Hoyningen-Huene 1993, 197-201). This\ndifference in the range of incommensurability between Kuhn and\nFeyerabend\u2019s versions finds its most striking expression in the\nway they regard the transition from the Ptolemaic to the Copernican\ntheory. For Kuhn, the differences between these two theories comprise\nan exemplary illustration of incommensurability. For Feyerabend,\nhowever, because planetary theory lacks the quality of universality,\nthere is no incommensurability (1975, 114). Furthermore, in his later\nwritings Kuhn insisted that the version of incommensurability he\nchampioned had always been \u201clocal incommensurability,\u201d a\nnotion that restricts conceptual change to a few, typically\ninterconnected concepts (cf. Hoyningen-Huene 1993, 213, 219). Thus,\nthere may be empirical consequences of incommensurable theory pairs\nthat can be immediately compared. For instance, the geocentric and\nheliocentric planetary theories are incommensurable in Kuhn\u2019s\nsense, while predictions of the planetary positions of both theories\nare fully commensurable, and can be immediately compared regarding\ntheir empirical accuracy. By contrast, Feyerabend always thought of\nhis concept more globally, as affecting all statements\nderivable from two fundamental theories (1962, 93; 1965c, 117; 1965b,\n216; 1975, 275\u2013276; 1981a, xi). \n\nBoth Kuhn and Feyerabend have often been misread as advancing the view\nthat incommensurability implies incomparability (cf. Hoyningen-Huene\n1993, 218ff.; Oberheim 2006, 235). In response to this misreading,\nKuhn repeatedly emphasized that incommensurability does not imply\nincomparability (cf. Hoyningen-Huene 1993, 236ff.). Theory comparison\nis merely more complicated than imagined by some philosophers of\nscience. In particular, it cannot fully be made\n\u2018point-by-point\u2019. It is not an algorithmic procedure (cf.\nHoyningen-Huene 1993, 147-154; Feyerabend 1975, 114; 1981a, 238), nor\none that requires translation into a neutral observation language.\nDifferent epistemic values, such as universality, accuracy,\nsimplicity, fruitfulness may pull in different directions (cf.\nHoyningen-Huene 1992, 492\u2013496; 1993, 150\u2013154; Feyerabend\n1981a, 16; 1981c, 238) allowing for the possibility of rational\ndisagreement. But even if a full point-by-point comparison of\nincommensurable theories is impossible, and even if theory comparison\ndoes not have the status of a proof, a comparative evaluation of\nincommensurable theories is still possible (cf. Hoyningen-Huene 1993,\n236-258; Carrier 2001) and rational in a means/ends or instrumental\nsense. For example, according to Kuhn it is rational to choose\ntheories that are better problem-solvers because they better serve the\nends of science. This property of theory choice makes the overall\nprocess of science both rational and progressive. With the notion of\nincommensurability, Kuhn was not so much challenging the rationality\nof theory choice, as trying to make room for the possibility of\nrational disagreement between proponents of competing paradigms. In\nfact, according to Kuhn, \u201cincommensurability is far from being\nthe threat to rational evaluation of truth claims that it has\nfrequently seemed. Rather, it\u2019s what is needed, within a\ndevelopmental perspective, to restore some badly needed bite to the\nwhole notion of cognitive evaluation. It is needed, that is, to defend\nnotions like truth and knowledge from, for example, the excesses of\npost-modernist movements like the strong program\u201d (2000 [1991],\n91).\n\nThe extent of the misreading of incommensurability as implying\nincomparability is even more dramatic in Feyerabend\u2019s case. A\nfar cry from claiming that incommensurable theories cannot be\ncompared, Feyerabend explicitly and repeatedly argued that\nincommensurable alternatives actually offer a better means of\ncomparing the merits of theories than the mere development of\ncommensurable alternatives (Feyerabend 1962, 66; cf. Oberheim 2006,\n235ff.). He illustrated this point with an example of a crucial\nexperiment between incommensurable theories. He argued that even\nthough the central concepts of statistical and classical\nphenomenological thermodynamics are incommensurable, it was still\npossible indirectly to stage a crucial experiment between them\n(Perrin\u2019s confirmation of Einstein\u2019s quantitative\npredictions of Brownian motion). This was the centre piece of\nFeyerabend\u2019s argument for pluralism. The argument turns on the\nclaim that this refutation of classical phenomenological\nthermodynamics could not have been conducted without the development\nof statistical thermodynamics, which is an incommensurable\nalternative. Feyerabend concluded that some observations can\nonly be interpreted as refutations of an existing theory\nafter an incommensurable alternative has been developed with which to\ninterpret them (cf. Oberheim 2006, 240\u2013245). His unorthodox\nimage of scientific progress is delineated as an increase in a set of\nincommensurable alternatives, each forcing the others into greater\narticulation (Feyerabend 1965c, 107; 1975, 30; cf. Oberheim 2005;\nOberheim 2006, 260ff.).\n\nThe source of the misunderstanding concerning incomparability appears\nto be Feyerabend\u2019s onetime suggestion that\n\u201cincommensurable theories may not possess any comparable\nconsequences\u201d (1962, 94). However, here Feyerabend was arguing\nthat although the same experimental set-up might produce a numerical\nresult that can be used to confirm both of two\nincommensurable theories (e.g. measuring the time of a freefalling\nstone to test predictions by both Newtonian mechanics and Relativity\ntheory), in order to use the result to confirm a theory, it must be\ninterpreted by that theory. Given that the two incommensurable\ntheories will use qualitatively incompatible concepts to\ninterpret quantitatively identical results, they will\ninterpret the same quantitative sentences as different qualitative\nstatements. Feyerabend concluded directly thereafter: \u201cHence,\nthere may not exist any possibility of finding a\ncharacterization of the observations which are supposed to\nconfirm two incommensurable theories\u201d (1962, 94, italics\ninserted). This does rule out the possibility of using a\nneutral observation language to compare the empirical\nconsequences of two incommensurable theories. Yet Feyerabend did not\nconclude that this inhibits their comparison, but rather that there is\nno need for a neutral observation language in order to\ncompare them. Feyerabend also mentions other possibilities of\ncomparing incommensurable theories (Feyerabend 1965b, 217; 1970, 228;\n1975, 284; 1978, 68; 1981a, 16). Some of these involve making\nsubjective judgments about how to weigh different values that may pull\nin different directions (methodological incommensurability).\n\nFinally, there is one central, substantive point of agreement between\nKuhn and Feyerabend. Both see incommensurability as precluding the\npossibility of interpreting scientific development as an approximation\nto truth (or as an \u201cincrease of verisimilitude\u201d)\n(Feyerabend, 1965c, 107; 1970, 220, 222, 227\u2013228; 1975, 30, 284;\n1978, 68; Kuhn 1970, 206; 2000 [1991], 95; 2000 [1993], 243ff.; cf.\nOberheim 2006, 180ff.; Hoyningen-Huene 1993, 262-264). They reject\nsuch characterizations of scientific progress because they recognize\nand emphasize that scientific revolutions result in changes in\nontology. Such changes are not just refinements of, or additions to,\nthe older ontology, such that these developments could be seen as\ncumulative additions to already established theoretical views. Rather,\nthe new ontology replaces its predecessor. Consequently,\nneither Kuhn nor Feyerabend can correctly be characterized as\nscientific realists who believe that science makes progress toward the\ntruth.\n",
