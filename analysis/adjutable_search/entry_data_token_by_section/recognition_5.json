    "main_text": "Four Forms of Recognition || Respect\n2.2 Respect\n\n\nEver since the idea of universal human rights has been established\nin modernity, assigning equal dignity or respect is commonly thought to\nbe the central dimension of recognition. Nearly every moral philosopher\nwriting today accepts this (Kantian) idea, even if not all embrace it\nin the terminology of recognition. One of the authors who explicitly\ndoes so is Thomas Scanlon. According to him, respect expresses the\nfoundation of morality as such, because the \u201ccontractualist ideal\nof acting in accord with principles that others (similarly motivated)\ncould not reasonably reject is meant to characterize the relations with\nothers the value and appeal of which underlies our reasons to do what\nmorality requires. This relation [\u2026] might be called a relation\nof mutual recognition. Standing in this relation to others is appealing\nin itself\u2014worth seeking for its own sake\u201d (Scanlon 1998,\n162). For Scanlon, therefore, moral blame is especially relevant because it signifies a disturbance of this basic relationship\n(Scanlon 2008, cf. Wallace 2012). What is valued here, again, is\nautonomous agency, the capacity to respond to reasons.\n\n\nMost discussions in moral and political philosophy can be seen as\ndisputes over what it means to recognize the other as equal, i.e., what\nproper respect demands. Such respect (for the humanity in each person)\nhas to be distinguished from a common usage in which\n\u201crespect\u201d denotes something quite different, namely a\ncertain respect for the (moral) qualities of a particular\nperson\u2019s character or conduct (for example, in Rawls 1971, \u00a7\n67; Sennett 2003). It has been proposed that the former should be\ntermed \u201crecognition respect\u201d whereas the latter should be\nlabeled \u201cappraisal respect\u201d (Darwall 1977). Appraisal\nrespect resembles esteem (see 2.3 below) in that particular properties\nof a person are valued\u2014and not so much the general fact that\nshe is a person capable of autonomous agency. In the\nfollowing, the term \u201crespect\u201d will be used to denote the\nattitude of \u201crecognition respect\u201d with regard to the equal\nmoral standing of persons and their demands.\n\n\nAs we face a continuum from severe degradation to phenomena of which\nit is hotly contested whether they are disrespectful, quite a few\ntheories of recognition have focused on the negative experiences of\nclear disrespect. In fact, the normative expectation of being\ntreated with respect is most obvious when we look at extreme forms of\nhumiliation in which specific (groups of) humans are symbolically and\nconsequently also materially excluded from humanity, are treated like\nanimals or mere objects. In response to such extreme forms of\nhumiliation, Margalit has concluded that our primary political aim\nshould be to strive for a decent society instead of a fully just one\n(Margalit 1996, 271\u2013291) and there has been some discussion about\nwhether recognition theory has a natural affinity with minimal or\nnegative theories of morality (Allen 2001).\n\n\nBeing faced with extreme humiliation, the interplay between\nnormative and psychological aspects becomes especially salient. Even if\nthe victims know that their degradation is unjustified, they cannot but\nfeel humiliated all the same. Any trust in being able to control their\nlives is stripped away from them. In the course of mistreatment,\ntorture and rape the perpetrators do not only intentionally inflict\npain and injury on their victims but also deride the agency of the\nlatter. This combination undermines basic self- and world-trust (Scarry\n1985; Rorty 1989, ch. 7\u20139; Margalit 1996, 115\u2013119, 145).\n\n\nHowever, even less extreme forms of mistreating persons manifest\ndisrespect. In these cases it is not necessarily denied that those\nunder discussion are humans, but rather that they have equal moral\nand/or legal standing. Instead of being approached as adults, women and\npeople of different color, for instance, were, for the most part of\nhistory, treated like children. They were regarded as\n\u201csecond-class citizens\u201d (Taylor 1992, 37) not capable of\nresponsibly reproducing and shaping the social norms of their\ncommunities. Only equal positive rights institutionalize recognition in\na publicly manifest way and thus make it easier for the individual to\ndevelop self-respect (Feinberg 1970, 251\u2013253), \u201cperhaps the most\nimportant primary good\u201d (Rawls 1971, \u00a7 67).\n\n\nNonetheless, there is a certain tension between recognizing somebody as\na legal rights holder and the idea of a full-fledged recognition order.\nThe very idea of subjective rights allows persons to step out of all\ninterpersonal relations and insist on their \u201cright\u201d\nwhatever reasons might be raised against that by others (Menke 2009).\nYet, in granting every subject the right to use their powers of reasons\nas they see fit, law recognizes their autonomous agency. It hereby\ntakes into account the fact of reasonable pluralism. Although people\nmight disagree with each other, toleration of the other\u2019s\ndissenting opinion is then supposed to be grounded in equal respect\n(see Forst 2013) and not only a way of grudgingly settling for a\nmodus vivendi. Nonetheless, theorists of recognition (within\nthe Hegelian tradition) have warned that concentrating entirely on\nnegative liberty without considering the wider social context in which\nsuch liberty is embedded and on which it depends might lead to social\npathologies (Honneth 2014, ch. 4). With this warning they join\ncommunitarian voices. Thus, one necessary step is to secure the\nlegitimacy of the legal order by ascribing equal democratic rights to\nall citizens. This recognizes them as being able to orient themselves\ntoward the common good (and not only to their self-interest).\n",
