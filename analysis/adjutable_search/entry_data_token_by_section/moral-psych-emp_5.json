Moral Disagreement\n\nGiven that moral disagreement\u2014about abortion, say, or capital\npunishment\u2014so often seems intractable, is there any reason to\nthink that moral problems admit objective resolutions? While this\ndifficulty is of ancient coinage, contemporary philosophical\ndiscussion was spurred by Mackie\u2019s (1977: 36\u20138)\n\u201cargument from relativity\u201d or, as it is called by later\nwriters, the \u201cargument from disagreement\u201d (Brink 1989:\n197; Loeb 1998). Such \u201cradical\u201d differences in moral\njudgment as are frequently observed, Mackie (1977: 36) argued,\n\u201cmake it difficult to treat those judgments as apprehensions of\nobjective truths\u201d.\n\nMackie supposed that his argument undermines moral realism,\nthe view that, as Smith (1994: 9, cf. 13) puts it, \n\n\nmoral questions have correct answers, that the correct answers are\nmade correct by objective moral facts \u2026 and \u2026 by\nengaging in moral argument, we can discover what these objective moral\nfacts\n are.[21]\n\n\n\nThis notion of objectivity, as Smith recognizes, requires\nconvergence in moral views\u2014the right sort of argument,\nreflection and discussion is expected to result in very substantial\nmoral agreement (Smith 1994:\n 6).[22]\n\nWhile moral realists have often taken pretty optimistic positions on\nthe extent of actual moral agreement (e.g., Sturgeon 1988: 229; Smith\n1994: 188), there is no denying that there is an abundance of\npersistent moral disagreement; on many moral issues there is a\nstriking failure of convergence even after protracted\nargument. Anti-realists like Mackie have a ready explanation for this\nphenomenon: Moral judgment is not objective in Smith\u2019s sense,\nand moral argument cannot be expected to accomplish what Smith and\nother realists think it\n can.[23]\n Conversely, the realist\u2019s task is to explain away\nfailures of convergence; she must provide an explanation of the\nphenomena consistent with it being the case that moral judgment is\nobjective and moral argument is rationally resolvable. Doris and\nPlakias (2008) call these \u201cdefusing explanations\u201d. The\nrealist\u2019s strategy is to insist that the preponderance of actual\nmoral disagreement is due to limitations of disputants or their\ncircumstances, and insist that (very substantial, if not\n unanimous)[24]\n moral agreement would emerge in ideal conditions,\nwhen, for example, disputants are fully rational and fully informed of\nthe relevant non-moral facts.\n\nIt is immediately evident that the relative merits of these competing\nexplanations cannot be fairly determined without close discussion of\nthe factors implicated in actual moral disagreements. Indeed, as acute\ncommentators with both realist (Sturgeon 1988: 230) and anti-realist\n(Loeb 1998: 284) sympathies have noted, the argument from disagreement\ncannot be evaluated by a priori philosophical means alone;\nwhat\u2019s needed, as Loeb observes, is \u201ca great deal of\nfurther empirical research into the circumstances and beliefs of\nvarious cultures\u201d. This research is required not only to\naccurately assess the extent of actual disagreement, but also to\ndetermine why disagreement persists or dissolves. Only then\ncan realists\u2019 attempts to \u201cexplain away\u201d moral\ndisagreement be fairly assessed.\n\nRichard Brandt, who was a pioneer in the effort to integrate ethical\ntheory and the social sciences, looked primarily to anthropology to\nhelp determine whether moral attitudes can be expected to converge\nunder idealized circumstances. It is of course well known that\nanthropology includes a substantial body of work, such as the classic\nstudies of Westermarck (1906) and Sumner (1908 [1934]), detailing the\nradically divergent moral outlooks found in cultures around the world.\nBut as Brandt (1959: 283\u20134) recognized, typical ethnographies do\nnot support confident inferences about the convergence of attitudes\nunder ideal conditions, in large measure because they often give\nlimited guidance regarding how much of the moral disagreement can be\ntraced to disagreement about factual matters that are not moral in\nnature, such as those having to do with religious or cosmological\nviews.\n\nWith this sort of difficulty in mind, Brandt (1954) undertook his own\nanthropological study of Hopi people in the American southwest, and\nfound issues for which there appeared to be serious moral disagreement\nbetween typical Hopi and white American attitudes that could not\nplausibly be attributed to differences in belief about nonmoral\n facts.[25]\n A notable example is the Hopi attitude toward animal suffering, an\nattitude that might be expected to disturb many non-Hopis:\n\n\n[Hopi children] sometimes catch birds and make \u201cpets\u201d of\nthem. They may be tied to a string, to be taken out and\n\u201cplayed\u201d with. This play is rough, and birds seldom\nsurvive long. [According to one informant:] \u201cSometimes they get\ntired and die. Nobody objects to this\u201d. (Brandt 1954: 213)\n\n\nBrandt (1959: 103) made a concerted effort to determine whether this\ndifference in moral outlook could be traced to disagreement about\nnonmoral facts, but he could find no plausible explanation of this\nkind; his Hopi informants didn\u2019t believe that animals lack the\ncapacity to feel pain, for example, nor did they have cosmological\nbeliefs that would explain away the apparent cruelty of the practice,\nsuch as beliefs to the effect that animals are rewarded for martyrdom\nin the afterlife. The best explanation of the divergent moral\njudgments, Brandt (1954: 245, 284) concluded, is a \u201cbasic\ndifference of attitude\u201d, since \u201cgroups do sometimes make\ndivergent appraisals when they have identical beliefs about the\nobjects\u201d.\n\nMoody-Adams argues that little of philosophical import can be\nconcluded from Brandt\u2019s\u2014and indeed from\nmuch\u2014ethnographic work. Deploying Gestalt psychology\u2019s\ndoctrine of \u201csituational meaning\u201d (e.g., Dunker 1939),\nMoody-Adams (1997: 34\u201343) contends that all institutions,\nutterances, and behaviors have meanings that are peculiar to their\ncultural milieu, so that we cannot be certain that participants in\ncross-cultural disagreements are talking about the same\n thing.[26]\n The problem of situational meaning, she thinks, threatens\n\u201cinsuperable\u201d methodological difficulty for those\nasserting the existence of intractable intercultural disagreement\n(1997: 36). Advocates of ethnographic projects will likely\nrespond\u2014not unreasonably, we think\u2014that judicious\nobservation and interview, such as that to which Brandt aspired,\ncan motivate confident assessments of evaluative diversity.\nSuppose, however, that Moody-Adams is right, and the methodological\ndifficulties are insurmountable. Now, there\u2019s an equitable\ndistribution of the difficulty: if observation and interview are\nreally as problematic as Moody-Adams suggests, neither the\nrealists\u2019 nor the anti-realists\u2019 take on\ndisagreement can be supported by appeal to empirical evidence. We do\nnot think that such a stalemate obtains, because we think the\nimplicated methodological pessimism excessive. Serious empirical work\ncan, we think, tell us a lot about cultures and the differences\nbetween them. The appropriate way of proceeding is with close\nattention to particular studies, and what they show and fail to\n show.[27]\n\nAs Brandt (1959: 101\u20132) acknowledged, the anthropological\nliterature of his day did not always provide as much information on\nthe exact contours and origins of moral attitudes and beliefs as\nphilosophers wondering about the prospects for convergence might like.\nHowever, social psychology and cognitive science have recently\nproduced research which promises to further discussion; during the\nlast 35 years, there has been an explosion of \u201ccultural\npsychology\u201d investigating the cognitive and emotional processes\nof different cultures (Shweder & Bourne 1982; Markus &\nKitayama 1991; Ellsworth 1994; Nisbett & Cohen 1996; Nisbett 1998,\n2003; Kitayama & Markus 1999; Heine 2008; Kitayama & Cohen\n2010; Henrich 2015). Here we will focus on some cultural differences\nfound close to (our) home, differences discovered by Nisbett and his\ncolleagues while investigating regional patterns of violence in the\nAmerican North and South. We argue that these findings support\nBrandt\u2019s pessimistic conclusions regarding the likelihood of\nconvergence in moral judgment.\n\nThe Nisbett group\u2019s research can be seen as applying the tools\nof cognitive social psychology to the \u201cculture of honor\u201d,\na phenomenon that anthropologists have documented in a variety of\ngroups around the world. Although these groups differ in many\nrespects, they manifest important commonalities:\n\n\nA key aspect of the culture of honor is the importance placed on the\ninsult and the necessity to respond to it. An insult implies that the\ntarget is weak enough to be bullied. Since a reputation for strength\nis of the essence in the culture of honor, the individual who insults\nsomeone must be forced to retract; if the instigator refuses, he must\nbe punished\u2014with violence or even death. (Nisbett & Cohen\n1996: 5)\n\n\nAccording to Nisbett and Cohen (1996: 5\u20139), an important factor\nin the genesis of southern honor culture was the presence of a herding\neconomy. Honor cultures are particularly likely to develop where\nresources are liable to theft, and where the state\u2019s coercive\napparatus cannot be relied upon to prevent or punish thievery. These\nconditions often occur in relatively remote areas where herding is a\nmain form of subsistence; the \u201cportability\u201d of herd\nanimals makes them prone to theft. In areas where farming rather than\nherding dominates, cooperation among neighbors is more important,\nstronger government infrastructures are more common, and\nresources\u2014like decidedly unportable farmland\u2014are harder to\nsteal. In such agrarian social economies, cultures of honor tend not\nto develop. The American South was originally settled primarily by\npeoples from remote areas of Britain. Since their homelands were\ngenerally unsuitable for farming, these peoples have historically been\nherders; when they emigrated from Britain to the American South, they\ninitially sought out remote regions suitable for herding, and in such\nregions, the culture of honor flourished.\n\nIn the contemporary South, police and other government services are\nwidely available and herding has all but disappeared as a way of life,\nbut certain sorts of violence continue to be more common than they are\nin the North. Nisbett and Cohen (1996) maintain that patterns of\nviolence in the South, as well as attitudes toward violence, insults,\nand affronts to honor, are best explained by the hypothesis that a\nculture of honor persists among contemporary white non-Hispanic\nsoutherners. In support of this hypothesis, they offer a compelling\narray of evidence, including:\n\ndemographic data indicating that (1) among southern whites,\nhomicides rates are higher in regions more suited to herding than\nagriculture, and (2) white males in the South are much more likely\nthan white males in other regions to be involved in homicides\nresulting from arguments, although they are not more likely\nto be involved in homicides that occur in the course of a robbery or\nother felony (Nisbett & Cohen 1996: Ch. 2)\nsurvey data indicating that white southerners are more likely than\nnortherners to believe that violence would be \u201cextremely\njustified\u201d in response to a variety of affronts, and that if a\nman failed to respond violently to such affronts, he was \u201cnot\nmuch of a man\u201d (Nisbett & Cohen 1996: Ch. 3)\nlegal scholarship indicating that southern states \u201cgive\ncitizens more freedom to use violence in defending themselves, their\nhomes, and their property\u201d than do northern states (Nisbett\n& Cohen 1996: Ch. 5, p. 63)\n\n\nTwo experimental studies\u2014one in the field, the other in the\nlaboratory\u2014are especially striking.\n\nIn the field study (Nisbett & Cohen 1996: 73\u20135), letters of\ninquiry were sent to hundreds of employers around the United States.\nThe letters purported to be from a hardworking 27-year-old Michigan\nman who had a single blemish on his otherwise solid record. In one\nversion, the \u201capplicant\u201d revealed that he had been\nconvicted for manslaughter. The applicant explained that he had been\nin a fight with a man who confronted him in a bar and told onlookers\nthat \u201che and my fianc\u00e9e were sleeping together. He\nlaughed at me to my face and asked me to step outside if I was man\nenough\u201d. According to the letter, the applicant\u2019s nemesis\nwas killed in the ensuing fray. In the other version of the letter,\nthe applicant revealed that he had been convicted of motor vehicle\ntheft, perpetrated at a time when he needed money for his family.\nNisbett and his colleagues assessed 112 letters of response, and found\nthat southern employers were significantly more likely to be\ncooperative and sympathetic in response to the manslaughter letter\nthan were northern employers, while no regional differences were found\nin responses to the theft letter. One southern employer responded to\nthe manslaughter letter as follows:\n\n\nAs for your problems of the past, anyone could probably be in the\nsituation you were in. It was just an unfortunate incident that\nshouldn\u2019t be held against you. Your honesty shows that you are\nsincere\u2026. I wish you the best of luck for your future. You have\na positive attitude and a willingness to work. These are qualities\nthat businesses look for in employees. Once you are settled, if you\nare near here, please stop in and see us. (Nisbett & Cohen 1996:\n75)\n\n\nNo letters from northern employers were comparably sympathetic.\n\nIn the laboratory study (Nisbett & Cohen 1996: 45\u20138)\nsubjects\u2014white males from both northern and southern states\nattending the University of Michigan\u2014were told that saliva\nsamples would be collected to measure blood sugar as they performed\nvarious tasks. After an initial sample was collected, the unsuspecting\nsubject walked down a narrow corridor where an experimental\nconfederate was pretending to work on some filing. The confederate\nbumped the subject and, feigning annoyance, called him an\n\u201casshole\u201d. A few minutes after the incident, saliva\nsamples were collected and analyzed to determine the level of\ncortisol\u2014a hormone associated with high levels of stress,\nanxiety and arousal, and testosterone\u2014a hormone associated with\naggression and dominance behavior. As Figure 1 indicates, southern\nsubjects showed dramatic increases in cortisol and testosterone\nlevels, while northerners exhibited much smaller changes.\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\nThe two studies just described suggest that southerners respond more\nstrongly to insult than northerners, and take a more sympathetic view\nof others who do so, manifesting just the sort of attitudes that are\nsupposed to typify honor cultures. We think that the data assembled by\nNisbett and his colleagues make a persuasive case that a culture of\nhonor persists in the American South. Apparently, this culture affects\npeople\u2019s judgments, attitudes, emotion, behavior, and even their\nphysiological responses. Additionally, there is evidence that child\nrearing practices play a significant role in passing the culture of\nhonor on from one generation to the next, and also that relatively\npermissive laws regarding gun ownership, self-defense, and corporal\npunishment in the schools both reflect and reinforce southern honor\nculture (Nisbett & Cohen 1996: 60\u201363, 67\u20139). In short,\nit seems to us that the culture of honor is deeply entrenched in\ncontemporary southern culture, despite the fact that many of the\nmaterial and economic conditions giving rise to it no longer widely\n obtain.[28]\n\nWe believe that the North/South cultural differences adduced by\nNisbett and colleagues support Brandt\u2019s conclusion that moral\nattitudes will often fail to converge, even under ideal conditions.\nThe data should be especially troubling for the realist, for despite\nthe differences that we have been recounting, contemporary northern\nand southern Americans might be expected to have rather more in\ncommon\u2014from circumstance to language to belief to\nideology\u2014than do, say, Yanomam\u00f6 and Parisians. So if there\nis little ground for expecting convergence in the case at hand, there\nis probably little ground in a good many others.\n\nFraser and Hauser (2010) are not convinced by our interpretation of\nNisbett and Cohen\u2019s data. They maintain that while those data do\nindicate that northerners and southerners differ in the strength of\ntheir disapproval of insult-provoked violence, they do not show that\nnortherners and southerners have a real moral disagreement. They go on\nto argue that the work of Abarbanell and Hauser (2010) provides a much\nmore persuasive example of a systematic moral disagreement between\npeople in different cultural groups. Abarbanell and Hauser focused on\nthe moral judgments of rural Mayan people in the Mexican state of\nChiapas. They found that people in that community do not judge\nactions causing harms to be worse than omissions\n(failures to act) which cause identical harms, while nearby urban\nMayan people and Western internet users judge actions to be\nsubstantially worse than omissions. \n\nThough we are not convinced by Fraser and Hauser\u2019s\ninterpretation of the Nisbett and Cohen data, we agree that the\nAbarbanell and Hauser study provides a compelling example of a\nsystematic cultural difference in moral judgement. Barrett et al.\n(2016) provides another example. That study looked at the extent to\nwhich an agent\u2019s intention affected the moral judgments of\npeople in eight traditional small-scale societies and two Western\nsocieties, one urban, one rural. They found that in some of these\nsocieties, notably including both Western groups, the agent\u2019s\nintention had a major effect, while in other societies agent intention\nhad little or no effect. \n\nAs we said at the outset, realists defending conjectures about\nconvergence may attempt to explain away evaluative diversity\nby arguing that the diversity is to be attributed to shortcomings of\ndiscussants or their circumstances. If this strategy can be made good,\nmoral realism may survive an empirically informed argument from\ndisagreement: so much the worse for the instance of moral reflection\nand discussion in question, not so much the worse for the objectivity\nof morality. While we cannot here canvass all the varieties of this\nsuggestion, we will briefly remark on some of the more common forms.\nFor concreteness, we will focus on Nisbett and Cohen\u2019s\nstudy.\n\nImpartiality. One strategy favored by moral realists\nconcerned to explain away moral disagreement is to say that such\ndisagreement stems from the distorting effects of individual interest\n(see Sturgeon 1988: 229\u2013230; Enoch 2009: 24\u201329); perhaps\npersistent disagreement doesn\u2019t so much betray deep features of\nmoral argument and judgment as it does the doggedness with which\nindividuals pursue their perceived advantage. For instance, seemingly\nmoral disputes over the distribution of wealth may be due to\nperceptions\u2014perhaps mostly inchoate\u2014of individual and\nclass interests rather than to principled disagreement about justice;\npersisting moral disagreement in such circumstances fails the\nimpartiality condition, and is therefore untroubling to the moral\nrealist. But it is rather implausible to suggest that North/South\ndisagreements as to when violence is justified will fail the\nimpartiality condition. There is no reason to think that southerners\nwould be unwilling to universalize their judgments across relevantly\nsimilar individuals in relevantly similar circumstances, as indeed\nNisbett and Cohen\u2019s \u201cletter study\u201d suggests. One can\nadvocate a violent honor code without going in for special\n pleading.[29]\n We do not intend to denigrate southern values; our point is that\nwhile there may be good reasons for criticizing the honor-bound\nsoutherner, it is not obvious that the reason can be failure of\nimpartiality, if impartiality is (roughly) to be understood along the\nlines of a willingness to universalize one\u2019s moral\njudgments.\n\nFull and vivid awareness of relevant nonmoral facts. Moral\nrealists have argued that moral disagreements very often derive from\ndisagreement about nonmoral issues. According to Boyd (1988: 213; cf.\nBrink 1989: 202\u20133; Sturgeon 1988: 229), \n\n\ncareful philosophical examination will reveal \u2026 that agreement\non nonmoral issues would eliminate almost all disagreement\nabout the sorts of moral issues which arise in ordinary moral\npractice. \n\n\nIs this a plausible conjecture for the data we have just considered?\nWe find it hard to imagine what agreement on nonmoral facts could do\nthe trick, for we can readily imagine that northerners and southerners\nmight be in full agreement on the relevant nonmoral facts in the cases\ndescribed. Members of both groups would presumably agree that the job\napplicant was cuckolded, for example, or that calling someone an\n\u201casshole\u201d is an insult. We think it much more plausible to\nsuppose that the disagreement resides in differing and deeply\nentrenched evaluative attitudes regarding appropriate responses to\ncuckolding, challenge, and insult.\n\nSavvy philosophical readers will be quick to observe that terms like\n\u201cchallenge\u201d and \u201cinsult\u201d look like\n\u201cthick\u201d ethical terms, where the evaluative and\ndescriptive are commingled (see Williams 1985: 128\u201330);\ntherefore, it is very difficult to say what the extent of the factual\ndisagreement is. But this is of little help for the expedient under\nconsideration, since the disagreement-in-nonmoral-fact response\napparently requires that one can disentangle factual\nand moral disagreement.\n\nIt is of course possible that full and vivid awareness of the nonmoral\nfacts might motivate the sort of change in southern attitudes\nenvisaged by the (at least the northern) moral realist. Were\nsoutherners to become vividly aware that their culture of honor was\nimplicated in violence, they might be moved to change their moral\noutlook. (We take this way of putting the example to be the most\nnatural one, but nothing philosophical turns on it. If you like,\nsubstitute the possibility of northerners endorsing honor values after\nexposure to the facts.) On the other hand, southerners might insist\nthat the values of honor should be nurtured even at the cost of\npromoting violence; the motto \u201cdeath before dishonor\u201d,\nafter all, has a long and honorable history. The burden of argument,\nwe think, lies with the realist who asserts\u2014culture and\nhistory notwithstanding\u2014that southerners would change their\nmind if vividly aware of the pertinent facts.\n\nFreedom from \u201cAbnormality\u201d. Realists may contend\nthat much moral disagreement may result from failures of rationality\non the part of discussants (Brink 1989: 199\u2013200). Obviously,\ndisagreement stemming from cognitive impairments is no embarrassment\nfor moral realism; at the limit, that a disagreement persists when\nsome or all disputing parties are quite insane shows nothing deep\nabout morality. But it doesn\u2019t seem plausible that\nsoutherners\u2019 more lenient attitudes towards certain forms of\nviolence are readily attributed to widespread cognitive disability. Of\ncourse, this is an empirical issue, but we don\u2019t know of any\nevidence suggesting that southerners suffer some cognitive impairment\nthat prevents them from understanding demographic and attitudinal\nfactors in the genesis of violence, or any other matter of fact. What\nis needed to press home a charge of irrationality is evidence of\ncognitive impairment independent of the attitudinal\ndifferences, and further evidence that this impairment is implicated\nin adherence to the disputed values. In this instance, as in many\nothers, we have difficulty seeing how charges of abnormality or\nirrationality can be made without one side begging the question\nagainst the other.\n\nNisbett and colleagues\u2019 work may represent a potent\ncounterexample to any theory maintaining that rational argument tends\nto convergence on important moral issues; the evidence suggests that\nthe North/South differences in attitudes towards violence and honor\nmight well persist even under the sort of ideal conditions under\nconsideration. Admittedly, such conclusions must be tentative. On the\nphilosophical side, not every plausible strategy for \u201cexplaining\naway\u201d moral disagreement and grounding expectations of\nconvergence has been\n considered.[30]\n On the empirical side, this entry has reported on but a few studies, and\nthose considered, like any empirical work, might be\ncriticized on either conceptual or methodological\n grounds.[31]\n Finally, it should be clear what this entry is not claiming:\nany conclusions here\u2014even if fairly earned\u2014are not a\n\u201crefutation\u201d of all versions of moral realism, since there\nare versions of moral realism that do not require convergence\n(Bloomfield 2001; Shafer-Landau 2003). \nRather, this discussion should give an idea of the empirical work\nphilosophers must encounter, if they are to make defensible\nconjectures regarding moral disagreement.\n",
