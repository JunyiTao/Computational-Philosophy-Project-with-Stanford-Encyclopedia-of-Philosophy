    "main_text": "\n\nTommaso Campanella (Stilo, 1568\u2013Paris, 1639) was one of the\nmost important philosophers of the late Renaissance. Although his\nbest-known work today is the utopian text La citt\u00e0 del\nSole (The City of the Sun), his thought was extremely\ncomplex and engaged with all fields of learning. The fundamental core\nof his thinking, which will be examined in this article, was concerned\nwith the philosophy of nature (what would nowadays be called science),\nmagic, political theory and natural religion.\n",
