    "main_text": "Personal Relations, Family, and Disability || Personal relationships and third-party assistance\n4. Conclusion\n\nHaving separately discussed well-being, health, and personal\nrelationship, the Entry concludes by considering the links among these\nthree domains, as they pertain to disability.\n\nOn most plausible accounts of well-being, health and personal\nrelationships are either instrumentally conducive to well-being or\npartially constitutive of it. An account of well-being which entailed\nthat health and personal relationships were not important means to or\nconstituents of well-being would be prima facie implausible.\nConsequently, an account of health entailing that persons with\ndisabilities are necessarily unhealthy, or an account of personal\nrelationships entailing that persons with disabilities cannot enjoy\nmany of the goods of those relationships, will also have the\nimplication that persons with disabilities cannot attain the same\nlevel of well-being as able-bodied persons absent\ncompensating capacities or achievements in other domains.\n\nMany laypersons, policymakers, and philosophers implicitly or\nexplicitly adopt theories of health and personal relationships with\nthis implication. But there are plausible accounts of health and\npersonal relationships which do not entail that disability is inimical\nto well-being. And on most plausible accounts of well-being,\ndisability need not present a formidable barrier to living a good\nlife. This is so on appropriately pluralistic, flexible and\nbroadly-framed objective-list accounts as well as on subjective\naccounts. A blind or deaf person cannot exercise all five senses. But\nthere are plausible arguments for the conclusion that they can have\nlives with rich aesthetic experience, pleasure, and joy.\n\nWe suggest that the difficulty in appreciating that people with\ndisabilities may have lives as good as those of people without\ndisabilities, objectively as well as subjectively, may arise in part\nfrom a failure of imagination by nondisabled people. A body of\nempirical research indicates that people without disabilities rate the\nsubjective well-being of people with disabilities far lower than they\nrate it themselves. (Albrecht and Devlieger 1999; Gill 2000; Goering\n2008). If all persons enjoy a defeasible presumption of epistemic\nauthority with respect to the quality of their experiences, this\ndivergence suggests that the widely shared assumption that\ndisabilities reduce quality of life should be regarded as\ncontroversial, not self-evident. Although we have no empirical\nresearch to support us, we suspect the same is true for the divergent\nassessments of the prospects for objective well-being of people with\ndisabilities. Non-disabled people may have greater difficulty\nimagining how people with disabilities can enjoy or develop the\ncapabilities for the various constituents of objective well-being,\nparticularly those concerning health and personal relationships.\n\nThis highlights a broader point connecting all three domains, as well\nas the relationship between philosophy and disability more generally.\nMost philosophical discussions of disability have implicitly assumed\nthe perspective of persons who do not have a disability. They have\nasked whether other people, the people with disabilities,\nhave lower levels of well-being; whether other people, the people with\ndisabilities, are less healthy; whether other people, the people with\ndisabilities, will pose a comparatively higher burden as friends or\nintimates. In much recent work in political philosophy, disability has\nfigured most prominently as a paradigm example of bad luck, and the\nquestion is whether and to what extent we the able-bodied should\ncompensate disabled others for their misfortune (see\n SEP entry on disability and justice).\n By implicitly adopting the perspective of nondisabled persons, from\nwhich persons with disabilities appear only in the third-person, much\nmainstream work in philosophy has failed to take seriously the\nperspectives of persons with disabilities\u2014even when those\nperspectives are directly relevant to the conceptual question under\ndiscussion: what is the nature of well-being, or friendship, or\nhealth? We hope that this entry can be a point of departure for a\ndiscussion of these concepts that takes into account a wider range of\nrelevant considered judgments, intuitions, and perspectives.\n",
