    "main_text": "Early Modern Foundations || Newtonian Revisions\n2.3 Newtonian Revisions\n\nThe introduction of Newtonian natural philosophy into this discussion\nhad ambiguous consequences depending on the interpretations given to\nNewton\u2019s natural philosophy. Newton\u2019s\nPhilosophi\u00e6 naturalis principia mathematica\n(Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy) of 1687, with\nsubsequent revised editions in 1713 and 1729 (Newton 1729 [1999]),\ndeveloped a fundamental critique of Cartesianism, and also introduced\nthe concept of attractive forces, able to act over a distance, into\nphysical explanations. Extending the concept of \u201cactive\npowers\u201d to the micro-level in his Opticks of 1704\n(English), with important revisions in editions of 1706 (Latin), 1717,\n1721, and 1730 (Newton 1730 [1952]), Newton introduced into biological\ndiscussions new issues that played out in complex ways in the\nsubsequent decades.\n\nOn one reading of Newton, his conception of active forces introduced\nback into life science a concept of \u201cdynamic\u201d matter that\ncould be used as a warrant for a new vitalistic embryology and even a\nnon-mechanistic conception of nature possessed of intrinsic powers\n(Schofield 1970: chp. 9). This option was followed out by many French\nmedical writers who used Newtonian arguments to ground a\n\u201cvitalistic\u201d medical theory, an interpretation\nparticularly developed at the University of Montpellier in the early\ndecades of the eighteenth century (Wolfe 2014; Gaukroger 2010: chps.\n10\u201311).\n\nBut in the more \u201cmechanistic\u201d interpretation of\nNewtonianism, this retained the inert character of matter and endorsed\nmany of the main features of Cartesian biomechanism, but with the\naddition of mathematical quantification and some use of attractive and\nrepulsive microforces (Schofield 1970: chp. 1). In this tradition of\ninterpretation, one finds a commitment to mechanistic preformationism\nand even strong \u201cpreexistence\u201d theory. This can be\nfollowed in the medical theories of Hermann Boerhaave, Archibald\nPitcairne (1652\u20131713), Richard Mead (1673\u20131754), and other\nNewtonian iatromechanists who typically had contact with the great\nDutch medical schools (Guerrini 1987).\n\nNewton had also argued in the long thirty-first Query to the\nOpticks against \u201cWorld-Building\u201d of the Cartesian\nform, as discussed above. Newton saw this as claiming that the world\n\u201cmight arise out of a Chaos by the mere Laws of Nature\u201d\n(Newton 1730 [1952], 378), and condemned this as\n\u201cunphilosophical\u201d (ibid., 401). Revival of\nrealistically interpreted historical cosmology in the eighteenth\ncentury involved a clear break with these Newtonian strictures. This\nshift will be developed in the following section.\n",
