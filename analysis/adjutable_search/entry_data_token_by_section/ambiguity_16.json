In particular, he makes\nthe following intriguing suggestion:\n\n\n\u201cBank\u201d is ambiguous; we would expect the ambiguity to be\ndisambiguated by separate and unrelated words in some other languages.\nWhy should the two separate senses be reproduced in languages\nunrelated to English? First, then, we can consult our linguistic\nintuitions, independently of any empirical investigation. Would we be\nsurprised to find languages that used two separate words for the two\nalleged senses of a given word? If so, then, to that extent our\nlinguistic intuitions are really intuitions of a unitary concept,\nrather than of a word that expresses two distinct and unrelated\nsenses. Second, we can ask empirically whether languages are in fact\nfound that contain distinct words expressing the allegedly distinct\nsenses. If no such language is found, once again this is evidence that\na unitary account of the word or phrase in question should be sought.\n(Kripke 1977: p. 268)\n\n\nIn other words, since lexical ambiguity should involve something like\naccidental homophony, one would expect that other languages would\nlexicalize these meanings differently. Thus, it would not surprise one\nto find out that the two meanings of \u2018bat\u2019 were expressed\nby two different words in other languages. It may well surprise one to\nfind out that every action verb was lexicalized as two different\nverbs, one for a reading on which the action was done intentionally,\none on which it wasn\u2019t in some other language.\n\nOne may worry about this test, especially with respect to its ability to\ndifferentiating sense generality from ambiguity. It would not be\nsurprising to find out that other languages lexicalize\n\u2018uncle\u2019 in two different words (in Croatian, there is no\none word translation of \u2018uncle\u2019: \u2018stric\u2019 means\nbrother of one\u2019s father and \u2018ujak\u2019 means an uncle\nfrom the mother\u2019s side). Nonetheless, there is no reason to\nthink that \u2018uncle\u2019 is ambiguous in English. Why\nwouldn\u2019t language users create words to designate the specific\nmeanings that are left sense-general in a different language?\n",
