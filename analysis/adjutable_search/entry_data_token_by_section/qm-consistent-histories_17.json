    "main_text": "Measurement and Preparation || Measurement\n7.2 Measurement\nTo study the physical implications of this model we need to\nintroduce a family of histories. From a mathematical perspective the\nsimplest such family is based solely on unitary time development and\ntakes the form\n\\[\\FC_u:\\;\\;[\\Psi_0]\\;\\odot\\; \\{[\\Psi_1],I-[\\Psi_1]\\}\\;\\odot\\;\n\\{[\\Psi_2], I-[\\Psi_2]\\}, \\label{eqn21}\\]\nwhere \\([\\Psi_1]\\) and \\([\\Psi_2]\\) are projectors onto the states\n\\(\\ket{\\Psi_1}\\) and \\(\\ket{\\Psi_2}\\) defined in \\eqref{eqn20}, and the\nfamily \\eqref{eqn21} should be interpreted as a set of four mutually\nexclusive histories obtained by choosing at \\(t_1\\) one of the\nprojectors inside the first pair of curly brackets, and at \\(t_2\\) one\ninside the second pair. The corresponding chain\nkets, subsection 4.2, are zero except for the\nsingle history \\([\\Psi_0]\\odot [\\Psi_1] \\odot [\\Psi_2]\\), which is\nassigned probability 1 by \\eqref{eqn17}.\nThe family \\(\\FC_u\\) is of no use for resolving the first measurement\nproblem M1, because the family of histories does not include the\nprojectors \\(\\{[m^j]\\}\\) for the pointer positions at time \\(t_2\\) needed\nto discuss the measurement outcome, nor can it be refined to include\nthem, because \\([\\Psi_2]\\) will not commute with some of the \\([m^j]\\),\nassuming at least two of the \\(c_j\\) in \\eqref{eqn18} are nonzero. This\nis the basic reason why the first measurement problem M1 is an\nenormous difficulty for quantum interpretations in which the only\npossible time dependence for a closed quantum system is that given by\nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation. By contrast, the histories approach gives the\nphysicist Liberty to use a different family\n\\[\\FC_1:\\;\\;[\\Psi_0]\\;\\odot\\;[\\Psi_1] \\;\\odot\\; \\{[m^j]\\}\n\\label{eqn22}\\]\nin place of \\(\\FC_u\\). Note that \\([m^j]\\) is understood as\n\\(I_s\\otimes[m^j]\\), using a common physicist\u2019s convention. In addition\na projector \\(R=I_m-\\sum_j[m^j]\\) should be included among the\npossibilities at the final time \\(t_2\\), but as it occurs with zero\nprobability it can be ignored. The consistency of the family \\(\\FC_1\\)\nis easily demonstrated, and the probability \\(|c_j|^2\\) for the final\nposition \\([m^j]\\) is an immediate consequence of \\eqref{eqn17}.\nHowever, the second measurement problem M2, relating the outcome of\nthe measurement to the property of the particle before the\nmeasurement, cannot be solved using the family \\(\\FC_1\\), because the\nproperties of interest, the \\([s^j]\\), are not included among the\npossibilities at time \\(t_1\\). To discuss these requires another\nfamily\n\\[\\FC_2:\\;\\;[\\Psi_0]\\;\\odot\\; \\{ [s^j]\\}\\;\\odot\\; \\{[m^k]\\}.\n\\label{eqn23}\\]\nAgain, \\([s^j]\\) can be understood as \\([s^j]\\otimes I_m\\), a property\nof the particle without reference to the apparatus. Showing that\n\\(\\FC_2\\) is consistent is straightforward, as is calculating the joint\nprobability distribution\n\\[\\Pr(\\,[s^j]_1,[m^k]_2) = |c_j|^2 \\delta_{jk} \\label{eqn24}\\]\nusing \\eqref{eqn17}. Here the subscripts refer to the time: the\nparticle property at time \\(t_1\\) before the measurement takes place,\nand the outcome at \\(t_2\\) when the measurement is over. The marginal\nprobabilities are\n\\[\\Pr([s^j]_1) = \\Pr([m^j]_2) = |c_j|^2.  \\label{eqn25}\\]\nThus for every case in which \\(c_k\\) is not zero (so \\([m^k]\\) occurs\nwith finite probability) one has the conditional probability\n\\[\\Pr([s^j]_1 \\boldsymbol{\\mid} [m^k]_2) = \\delta_{jk}.\n\\label{eqn26}\\]\nIn other words, given a measurement outcome \\([m^k]\\) at \\(t_2\\) one\ncan be certain that the prior state of the particle at \\(t_1\\) was\n\\([s^k]\\); i.e., the apparatus did what it was designed to do.\n",
