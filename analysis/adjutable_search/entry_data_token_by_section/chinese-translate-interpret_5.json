    "main_text": "Metaphysical Issues || The Hypothesis of the Relativity of Linguistics\n2.3 The Hypothesis of the Relativity of Linguistics\nThat idea can and does also refer to an overall way of being in and\nresponding to one\u2019s world, which has been an important topic in\nphilosophy and linguistics since Benjamin Lee Whorf, who along with\nhis teacher Edward Sapir developed what has come to be known as the\nSapir-Whorf hypothesis of linguistic relativity.  Stated simply the\nthesis is that the way human beings perceive and describe the world in\nwhich they live is a function of the structure of the native\nlanguage(s) they acquire to describe and interact with it.  In\nWhorf\u2019s words,\n \n\u2026[T]he grammar of each language is not\n merely a reproducing instrument for voicing ideas but rather is\n itself the shaper of ideas, the program and guide for the\n individual\u2019s mental\u2026development. (1956: 212)\n \nThere is a \u201cstrong\u201d version of the hypothesis, namely,\nthat the language structures determine the conceptual map we\nemploy in negotiating our world, and a weaker version that those\nstructures influence construction and use of the map, or to\nreturn to Davidson\u2019s language, the \u201cconceptual\nscheme\u201d. Relatively few people subscribe to the strong version\nof the hypothesis, but the weaker formulation has many adherents. For\nthinking about translation issues, however, it is useful to note that\nthe standard objection to the strong interpretation of Whorf\u2019s\nclaim is that if it was correct, he wouldn\u2019t be able to give\nexamples of it. Davidson (among others), argues that Whorf endeavors\nto describe the alien metaphysics of the Hopi, based on their\nlanguage, using, of course, English (Davidson 1973: 5). Mandelbaum\ndoes the same for Whorf\u2019s account of Apache and Shawnee (1979:\n67). The point of the objection in both cases is that major\ndifferences between languages in what they identify or call our\nattention to notwithstanding, they may all be described in a single\nlanguage.\nBut that is not the point that a strong version of Whorf\nemphasizes. As Graham argued,\n \nWhorf would hardly have denied that bilingual\nreaders would be clearer about the divergence with an equally\nsophisticated Hopi account to compare with his. (1992: 68)\n \nOf course we can give an account of different patterns of syntax\nand naming\u2014not different truths\u2014between languages, in a\nsingle language; that is what field linguists do, and increasingly,\ncomparative philosophers. Given that the 47 Eskimo words for\n\u201csnow\u201d has been exposed as a hoax (Pullum 1991: 166) we\nmust take another example of the Whorfian orientation and its\nimplications. In China, native speakers do not seem to have\ngrandparents or siblings simpliciter. Rather do they have\nindividual lexical items for mother\u2019s father, mother\u2019s\nmother, father\u2019s father, father\u2019s mother; and until the\none child policy went into effect they had younger brothers and older\nbrothers, and the same for sisters. Many of them will also use\ndistinguishing kin names for other elders with whom they stand in a\nrelation, whereas English makes do with generic \u201caunt\u201d and\n\u201cuncle\u201d. There is nothing at all mysterious here, nor any\nquestion of truth: the Chinese simply have many more and specific\nkinship terms than English speakers.\nA more complicated if not mysterious situation obtains, however,\nwhen we shift from simple naming to matters more syntactic. Graham\nagain (1992: 78):\n  Since the interrogative words of different languages\nare not synonymous, and connect with their syntactic structures, it\nseems inevitable that Aristotle or anyone else asking questions with\nthem will be categorizing along lines initially set by the language in\nwhich he thinks.\n Appreciating the full significance of what Graham is saying here\nfor issues of translation and interpretation is difficult at first,\nfor the very simple reason that the Aristotelian categories are quite\nfamiliar to students of Western philosophy, having been conveyed to\nthem in translations from the Greek into English; therefore the\ninterrogatives of Greek won\u2019t seem all that foreign to us, and\nwe feel fairly confident that we can read and understand Aristotle\npretty much as he intended to be read.\nThus, if we think only in terms of translating into or out of our\nnative tongue, and draw all our examples therefrom, many of\nthe more general linguistic and conceptual difficulties\nattendant on the work of translation and textual exegesis elude our\nunderstanding against the Whorfian perspective. To see what is at\nstake, let us suppose that a South Asian philosopher wished to\ntranslate Kant\u2019s Critique of Pure Reason into Sanskrit.\nAt first blush it appears that there will be a fair amount of semantic\noverlap in the vocabularies (perhaps not entirely surprising, both\nGerman and Sanskrit being Indo-European languages). For the dual\nnature of the world, sa\u1e43s\u0101ra can work very well\nfor phenomena (the world of experience), and the non-negative\ndimensions of nirvana can stand duty for noumenal\n(The world beyond, of which we cannot speak or know directly). The\nfits are not exact, but close.  Maya\napproximates Erscheinungswelt (the world of appearances),\nand dharma seems to embody pretty well Kant\u2019s\noverarching concern with the concept of duty, especially\nsince dharma also means and is closely bound up with\n\u2019law,\u2019 matching Kant\u2019s linking of duty and (moral)\nlaw.\nThese semantic parallels are not inconsequential,\nbut it is highly unlikely that by utilizing a Sanskrit vocabulary\nKant\u2019s philosophy is going to come through a translation at all\nclearly. What, for example, to do with karma? It does not\nappear in the Critique or in any of Kant\u2019s other\nwritings. The Hindu Sanskritist, however, might believe that every\nrational person had an idea of karma even though it might not\nalways be explicit beyond the confines of Indian civilization, and\ntherefore feel justified in attributing the concept to\nKant implicitly, and get on with his translation and\nexegesis. Of course for us this will not do; it is incredible that the\nconcept of karma played any role whatsoever in Kant\u2019s\nthinking. But if this be admitted, then the employment of the other\nterms adumbrated above becomes suspect, for their meanings are linked\nintimately not only to each other, but\nto karma. The dharma of each of us is determined by\nour karma, the chains of which, speaking figuratively, we\nmust break if we are to escape samsara\nfor nirvana.\n Thus Whorf seems to require translators and interpreters\u2014of\nnon-Indo-European language materials in particular\u2014to think\nabout how best to explicate abstract classifications based on\ngrammatical categories and lexical items not found in one of the\nlanguages under study. But in addition to the conceptual, it is also\nimperative to think carefully about how best to explicate the\nexperiential sense of being in the world among speakers of very\ndifferent languages. Returning to our earlier example of kin terms,\nthe Whorfian orientation suggests we might ask whether or how young\nChinese are or are not situated in their families differently than\ntheir American cousins, owing to the difference in the specificity of\nthe relations in which they stand and speak with their kin.\nThat is to say, the Whorfian hypothesis does not have to be\nconstrued as having to do solely, or even mainly with truth\nconditions, but rather with human experiences as they are\nmolded by the languages people speak that affect the contexts of their\nexperiences. This is what seems to be the point of the Whorfian\nhypothesis: there are very different ways we may describe and be in\nthe world we inhabit jointly, but experience differently because of\nour language and cultural determinants, and thus describe in ways that\nmay not be altogether intertranslatable with a language that molded\ndifferent experiences for its speakers.\nThus the translator and exegete must struggle to convey the ways of\nbeing in the world the authors of their texts indicate in their\nwritings, and learn how to get around the problems caused by the fact\nthat not all passages from the Chinese classical texts are fully\nintertranslatable into English. It is an important struggle which few\ntranslators have engaged in, but must begin to tackle if the charge of\na Eurocentric bias in Chinese philosophy is ever going to be fully met\n(see \u00a73.4, below).\nConceptual relativism does not follow from these claims. It would\nfollow only if two languages were fully intertranslatable, but that a\ntrue statement in one turned out to be false in the other; so far no\nplausible examples of this possibility have been advanced. Thus truth\nconditions \u00e0 la Davidson should not be of direct\nconcern in these contexts\u2014but will be in the consideration of\nhow to deal with incommensurability with respect to exegetical\nmethodologies, to which we will turn\nin \u00a74.1.\n",
