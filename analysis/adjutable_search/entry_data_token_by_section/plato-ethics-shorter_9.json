    "main_text": "Euthyphro\n13. Euthyphro\n\nA dialogue of definition, the Euthyphro takes up the subject\nof reverence or piety, a virtue that traditionally bears on the\nkeeping of oaths, the treatment of the weak (such as prisoners and\nsuppliants), family relationships, and respect toward the gods. The\ndiscussion here lifts reverence out of its traditional context, while\nmarking sharply the difference between reasoning about ethics and\naccepting authority. The argument as a whole may imply support for the\n unity of virtue.\n\nSocrates is on his way to answer the indictment against him; Euthyphro\nis apparently a well-known crank on religious matters; his name\nironically means \u201cstraight-thinker.\u201d He has just lodged a\ncharge against his father for the accidental death of a servant\naccused of murder. Most Athenians would probably have been shocked by\nthe irreverence of Euthyphro\u2019s prosecution of his father, but\nEuthyphro is confident he is doing the right thing. His confidence\nrests on the special knowledge he claims on the subject of\nreverence.\n\nSocrates presupposes that such special knowledge implies knowledge of\nthe definition of reverence. If Euthyphro knows what reverence is, he\nshould teach that to Socrates, so that Socrates may use the knowledge\nin defense during his own trial. Euthyphro\u2019s first two answers\nfail the first two conditions of\n Socratic definition;\n the first is not general (\u201cwhat I am doing\nnow\u201d\u20146d), and the second (being loved by a god) would make\nthe same things both reverent and irreverent; one god\u2019s love\nwould make an action reverent, while another god\u2019s hate would\nmake the same action irreverent (8ab). Socrates helps Euthyphro to a\nbetter answer (reverence is what is loved by all the gods), but this\nsuccumbs to the requirement that a definition state the essence of its\nsubject (11ab). The essence of reverence cannot be conferred on\nreverent actions by the gods\u2019 approval of them; their approval,\nrather, must follow on the actions\u2019 partaking of the essential\nnature of reverence. So actions are made reverent not by pleasing a\ngod, but by satisfying the definition of reverence\u2014or so most\nmodern readers have inferred.\n\nSocrates then explores the idea that reverence is a proper part of\njustice, without finding a way to specify what part it is. Attempts to\ndifferentiate reverence from justice by appeal to the gods lead back\nto the better answer that was refuted earlier. The conclusion is\naporia (impasse); many scholars believe that it points to a\ntheoretical conclusion, a component of Socrates\u2019 doctrine of the\nunity of virtue. There is no way to differentiate reverence from\njustice in a definition, because there is no essential difference\nbetween them; reverence is simply justice described with reference to\nthe love that the gods bear for justice. Other scholars have held that\nSocratic reverence is the specific duty we have to the gods that we\ncultivate all of virtue in our souls, as suggested by Socrates\u2019\nclaim in the Apology that his mission was given him by the\ngod (Woodruff 2019).\n",
