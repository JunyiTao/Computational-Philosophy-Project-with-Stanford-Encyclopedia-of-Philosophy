    "main_text": "Intuitionism || The two acts of intuitionism\n2.1 The two acts of intuitionism\n\nAccording to Brouwer mathematics is a languageless creation of the\nmind. Time is the only a priori notion, in the Kantian sense. Brouwer\ndistinguishes two acts of intuitionism:\n\nThe first act of intuitionism is: \n\nCompletely separating mathematics from mathematical language and hence\nfrom the phenomena of language described by theoretical logic,\nrecognizing that intuitionistic mathematics is an essentially\nlanguageless activity of the mind having its origin in the perception\nof a move of time. This perception of a move of time may be described\nas the falling apart of a life moment into two distinct things, one of\nwhich gives way to the other, but is retained by memory. If the twoity\nthus born is divested of all quality, it passes into the empty form of\nthe common substratum of all twoities. And it is this common\nsubstratum, this empty form, which is the basic intuition of\nmathematics. (Brouwer 1981, 4\u20135)\n\n\nAs will be discussed in the section on mathematics, the first act of\nintuitionism gives rise to the natural numbers but implies a severe\nrestriction on the principles of reasoning permitted, most notably the\nrejection of the principle of the excluded middle. Owing to the\nrejection of this principle and the disappearance of the logical basis\nfor the continuum, one might, in the words of Brouwer, \u201cfear\nthat intuitionistic mathematics must necessarily be poor and anaemic,\nand in particular would have no place for analysis\u201d (Brouwer\n1952, 142). The second act, however, establishes the existence of the\ncontinuum, a continuum having properties not shared by its classical\ncounterpart. The recovery of the continuum rests on the notion of\nchoice sequence stipulated in the second act, i.e. on the existence of\ninfinite sequences generated by free choice, which therefore are not\nfixed in advance.\n\nThe second act of intuitionism is:\n\nAdmitting two ways of creating new mathematical entities: firstly in\nthe shape of more or less freely proceeding infinite sequences of\nmathematical entities previously acquired \u2026; secondly in the\nshape of mathematical species, i.e. properties supposable for\nmathematical entities previously acquired, satisfying the condition\nthat if they hold for a certain mathematical entity, they also hold\nfor all mathematical entities which have been defined to be\n\u201cequal\u201d to it \u2026. (Brouwer 1981, 8)\n\n\nThe two acts of intuitionism form the basis of Brouwer\u2019s\nphilosophy; from these two acts alone Brouwer creates the realm of\nintuitionistic mathematics, as will be explained below. Already from\nthis basic principles it can be concluded that intuitionism differs\nfrom Platonism and formalism, because neither does it assume a\nmathematical reality outside of us, nor does it hold that mathematics\nis a play with symbols according to certain fixed rules. In\nBrouwer\u2019s view, language is used to exchange mathematical ideas\nbut the existence of the latter is independent of the former. The\ndistinction between intuitionism and other constructive views on\nmathematics according to which mathematical objects and arguments\nshould be computable, lies in the freedom that the second act allows\nin the construction of infinite sequences. Indeed, as will be\nexplained below, the mathematical implications of the second act of\nintuitionism contradict classical mathematics, and therefore do not\nhold in most constructive theories, since these are in general part of\nclassical mathematics.\n\nThus Brouwer\u2019s intuitionism stands apart from other philosophies\nof mathematics; it is based on the awareness of time and the\nconviction that mathematics is a creation of the free mind, and it\ntherefore is neither Platonism nor formalism. It is a form of\nconstructivism, but only so in the wider sense, since many\nconstructivists do not accept all the principles that Brouwer believed\nto be true.\n",
