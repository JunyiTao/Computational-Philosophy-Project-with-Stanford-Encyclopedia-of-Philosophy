    "main_text": "Criticisms of \u201cliberal\u201d eugenics || Disability rights critiques\n3.4 Disability rights critiques\n\n\nCommon among liberal eugenic proponents is the\nassumption that disability is a bad state. Selecting or editing against\ndisability is thus understood as what parents who care about their\nchildren\u2019s wellbeing ought to do. In response, the disability\ncommunity has presented strong arguments against liberal eugenics. The\ndisability rights critique of the \u201cnew\u201d eugenics takes on\ncurrent practices such as prenatal testing and PGT and selective\nabortion or destruction of embryos, as well as options such as gene\nediting.\n3.4.1 The expressivist argument\n\n\nIn what is known as the expressivist\nargument, disability theorists have argued that screening\nembryos or fetuses followed by destruction of the embryos or abortion\nof fetuses sends a negative message \u2013 \u201cIt is better not to\nexist than to have a disability\u201d (Saxton 2000), \u201cWe do not\nwant any more like you\u201d (Wendell 1996) \u2013 to existing people\nwith disabilities, particularly those living with disabilities for\nwhich testing is routinely done. The negative message is harmful and\nmight be considered a form of discrimination.\n\n\nThe expressivist argument highlights the ways in\nwhich prenatal testing feels threatening to people with disabilities\nand their allies/advocates. As Parens and Asch point out,\n\n\nIf one thinks for even a moment about the history\nof our society\u2019s treatment of people with disabilities, it is not\ndifficult to appreciate why people identified with the disability\nrights movement might regard such testing as dangerous. \u2026 living\nwith disabling traits need not be detrimental either to an individual\u2019s\nprospects of leading a worthwhile life, or to the families in which\nthey grow up, or to society at large. (2000: 4).\n\n\nThe expressivist argument is often defended by\ntheorists who are staunchly pro-choice about abortion; they typically\ndefend a woman\u2019s legal right to choose abortion for any reason but\npresent a moral argument against particular reasons for selective\nabortion. In making this distinction, they rely on the\n\u201cany/particular\u201d distinction proposed by Asch (2000): a\nwoman who does not want any child because she is not\nready to be a mother is different from one who is eager to be a mother\nbut then rejects this particular fetus or embryo, based on screening. A\ndifferent version of the expressivist argument looks beyond the\nindividual act of testing to focus on the\nsocial offer of prenatal testing, particularly in a\nsociety where it has become routinized, to consider the negative\nevaluation it expresses about the lives of existing people with\ndisabilities (Press 2000).\n\n\nObjections have been raised regarding the meaning\nof such \u201cexpressions\u201d (see, for instance, Buchanan 1996;\nNelson 2000), and the necessity of the negative message (Baily 2000;\nMcMahan 2005), as well as the relative moral significance of the\nmessage even if it is negative and expressed (Edwards 2004). Many\ntheorists emphasize that one can value the person with a disability,\nwhile devaluing the disability (Savulescu 2001; Glover 2006; McMahan\n2005). Glover (2006), for instance, is careful to note that we should\nbe very clear about expressing support for existing people with\ndisabilities even as we seek prenatal testing or other genetic\ninterventions.\n\n\nSuch distinction, however, can be difficult to\naccept for individuals who experience their disability as a central\npart of their identity (for discussion, see Wendell 1996; Saxton 2000;\nEdwards 2004). Furthermore, as Holm (2007) notes, even if we could\nconceptually separate prenatal testing from the disrespectful and\ndiscriminatory messages about people with disabilities, that does not\nmean they aren\u2019t deeply intertwined in current screening practices.\n\n\nSome disability rights advocates reject the\nexpressivist argument and are more concerned with the fairness and\ncompleteness of the information provided in the context of prenatal\ntesting than in the practice as a whole (Shakespeare 2006; Klein 2011;\nKaposy 2018). These advocates call attention to the attitudes,\npractices, education, and research of professionals involved in\nadministering prenatal testing and the prejudices rampant in our\nsociety against people with disabilities. They evince a disregard for\nthe experiences of disability as well as an ignorance of disability\nissues. The biases against people with disabilities that underly\ndecisions about selective abortion threaten the wellbeing of those with\ndisabilities.\n\n\nKaposy\u2019s book, Choosing Down\nSyndrome, for example, presents an extended argument for the\nposition that people with Down Syndrome can and often do have good\nlives, full of the wide variety of joys and sorrows attendant to being\nhuman. As he notes early on, the genetic realities (i.e., what is\navailable during prenatal testing) of Down Syndrome don\u2019t tell\nthe whole story.\n\n\nHe worries that expanded use of non-invasive first\ntrimester tests may ultimately increase the number of abortions of\nfetuses with Trisomy 21 and with it, further threaten the wellbeing of\npeople with Down Syndrome. But rather than arguing that people should\nnot selectively abort fetuses with Trisomy 21, pro-choice\nKaposy argues for a more capacious understanding of how good life can\nbe and why choosing to continue pregnancy after such a\ndiagnosis is perfectly reasonable. Indeed, if more people chose to have\nchildren with Down syndrome this would counter the prevalence of\nharmful prejudices. His key concern is that much of the impetus to\nabort following a prenatal diagnosis comes from misinformation, faulty\ninferences, and biases that people might disavow if they were made\naware of them. He offers his book as a way to increase the\n\u201csocial fund of knowledge.\u201d\n3.4.2 The meaning of disability\n\n\nPart of what concerns disability rights advocates\nis the questionable relation between the existence of certain\nimpairments or bodily anomalies and the availability of equality of\nopportunity or well-being (Silvers, Wasserman, and Mahowald 1998;\nAmundson 2005; Asch and Wasserman 2005) that seems to be a common\npresumption in liberal eugenics theories. Broadly, they worry that many\nof these theorists are relatively uninformed about the life experiences\nof people with disabilities, or unfairly dismissive of their claims\n(Amundson 2005; Goering 2008), and thus rely on an overly negative\nevaluation of their quality of life. As such, efforts to promote\n\u201cgood birth\u201d often undervalue existing people with\ndisabilities. Additionally, advocates of liberal eugenics, it is\nargued, allow one trait to stand in for all of what a potential person\ncan be (Asch and Wasserman 2005), and underestimate the value of human\ndiversity that includes non-standard modes of human functioning linked\nto disability (Silvers 1998; Garland-Thomson 2012), and the possibility\nof \u201cgains\u201d made possible through living with disability\n(Baumrin and Murray 2014). (For more discussion, see entries on \n disability: definitions and models; \n and \n feminist perspectives on disability.)\n\n\nAt least some liberal eugenic advocates are aware\nof this concern and have explored the possibility that our current\nsocial norms might be \u201cmorally defective\u201d in respect to\ndisability. For instance, Glover defends the permissibility of parental\nchoice within some limits, but he investigates just what counts as a\ndisability. He proposes that a disability involves a functional\nlimitation that \u201cimpairs the capacity for human\nflourishing\u201d (2006: 9), either by itself or in conjunction with\nsocial disadvantage. Thus, although racism results in social\ndisadvantage, having dark skin is not itself a disability, because it\nhas no associated functional limitation. Some conditions previously\nconsidered disabilities \u2013 e.g., achondroplasia \u2013 need not be\ndisabilities at all, according to this view (for more on\nachondroplasia, see Miller 2006; Davis 2010). Glover understands\n\u201cfunctional limitations\u201d as a contrast to normal human\nfunctioning, a species-based notion that itself involves significant\ndegrees of variation and the matter of setting (rather than\ndiscovering) boundaries. As such, \u201cnormal\u201d is not purely\nstatistical, but also partly normative (see also Buchanan et al. 2000).\nGlover recognizes the conceptual messiness of \u201cnormal\nfunctioning\u201d but still prefers it to alternatives. If an\nindividual prefers a bodily state that might otherwise count as a\nfunctional limitation (his example is Asperger\u2019s syndrome), then it\nisn\u2019t a disability for her (2006: 14); it does not\naffect her flourishing. He is much less sanguine about blindness and\ndeafness. Both conditions, he suggests, confer significant functional\nlimitations, and although they can certainly allow\nindividuals to have lives of great worth and flourishing \u2013 he\nexplores conflicting first-person accounts about going blind and\ngaining sight to explore the positive sides of the conditions and the\nnegative side of normalizing (2006: 15\u201322) \u2013 he concludes\nthat they are nonetheless disabilities that confer clear disadvantages\n(related to navigation, safety, etc.). As such, they are disabilities\nthat are understandably acceptable to some, but that ought not be\nchosen for future children. Such future children, like their parents,\nmight be able to flourish with the condition, but engineering it means\nintentionally impairing at least some capacities commonly relevant to\nflourishing. Interestingly, Glover concludes that the Deaf lesbian\ncouple who sought a deaf sperm donor did nothing wrong in conceiving\ntheir deaf child (the child cannot be harmed by his clearly worthwhile\nexistence), but he argues they would be wrong in not giving him a\ncochlear implant if the technology were perfected\n(2006: 26).\n\n\nGlover\u2019s attention to the difficulty of defining\ndisability is helpful, and he emphasizes the importance of taking\nseriously the perspectives of people who have lived with the\ndisabilities in question. But disability scholars push back on this\nline of argument by noting the inherent presumptions about what\nconstitutes flourishing or well-being that underlie the view (Campbell\nand Stramondo 2017; see also Schroeder 2018 who articulates a different\nview about the relevance of well-being, but with similar practical\nconclusions). For instance, what justifies the claim that living in\nsome disabled bodies is clearly disadvantageous, even if the individual\nliving that way understandably values her body, and not just as a\nnecessary reality but as a point of pride (Barnes 2016, esp. Ch 6)?\nWhat epistemic grounds are there for the claim that such a person has\nadapted \u2013 perhaps admirably, to a lesser condition \u2013 rather than\nsimply enjoys living one of a wide variety of good lives (Amundson\n2005, Barnes 2016, Stramondo 2021)?\n\n\nFurther, some scholars argue that disability (and\nalso race) are not simple passive products of reproduction. They are\ninstead active technologies in reproduction. They are instruments\ncreated and used in particular contexts and in the service of certain\ngoals and processes (Valentine 2021). Eugenics arguments often\nnaturalize race and disability as features of bodies, but these\ncategories can instead be understood as practices, relations, and forms\nof social organization (Valentine 2021, Benjamin 2019). On this view,\nthe idea that disability just is a functional limitation with inherent\ndisadvantages \u2013 disadvantages that can be addressed through\nreprogenetics interventions \u2013 ignores the fluidity of the\ncategories and the ways in which larger forces are at play, and it\nthereby ignores social problems, and social, structural solutions\n(Valentine 2021).\n",
