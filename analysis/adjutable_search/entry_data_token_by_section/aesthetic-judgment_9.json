Others dispute this\n(Zangwill 1999). This is one aspect of debates over formalism in many\ndomains. These issues are both central theoretical commitments as well\nas reflecting substantive aesthetic differences in the approach to\nmaking and appreciating various arts, as well as the aesthetics of\nnature. But such debates all presuppose that some dependence\nthesis holds. The controversial questions are about the\nextent of the dependence base of aesthetic properties, not\nwhether aesthetic properties have some nonaesthetic\ndependence base.\n\nOne view is that aesthetic properties depend on the\nappearances of things\u2014the way things look or sound, for\nexample (see Mitrovi\u0107 2013, 2018). If so, there is a\nsense in which aesthetic properties are mind-dependent, since\nappearances are appearances to some observer. However, some say that\nthere can be aesthetic properties of abstract objects such as\nmathematical or logical proofs or structures. Others say that ideas or\nconcepts in conceptual art may be the bearers of aesthetic properties.\n(Schellekens 2007). Those aesthetic properties would be\nmind-independent. The question of the aesthetic properties of abstract\nobjects is a controversial one (Kivy 1991, Barker 2009).\n",
