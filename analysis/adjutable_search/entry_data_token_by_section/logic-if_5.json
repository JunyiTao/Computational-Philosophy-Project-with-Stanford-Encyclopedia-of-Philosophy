    "main_text": "Metalogical Properties of IF First-order Logic || Compositionality and the failure of Tarski-type semantics\n4.4 Compositionality and the failure of Tarski-type semantics\n\nThe principle of compositionality (a.k.a. Frege principle) states that\nsemantic attributes of a complex expression \\(E\\) are determined by\nthe semantic attributes of its constituent expressions and the\nstructure of \\(E\\). In particular, the semantic attribute of interest\n(e.g., truth) may be determined in terms of one or more\nauxiliary semantic attributes (e.g.,\n satisfaction).[49]\n Hintikka has argued that compositionality amounts to semantic\ncontext-independence: semantic attributes of a complex expression\ndepend only on the semantic attributes of its constituent\nexpressions, plus its structure \u2013 they do not depend on\nthe sentential context in which the expression is embedded. Semantic\ncontext-independence makes it possible to carry out semantic analysis\nfrom inside out \u2013 from simpler expressions to more\ncomplex\n ones.[50]\n This is what is needed for recursive definitions of semantic\nattributes \u2013 such as Tarski-type definitions of truth and\nsatisfiability \u2013 to be\n possible.[51]\n By contrast, the GTS analysis of sentences is an outside in\nprocess: a semantic game starts with an entire sentence, and stepwise\nanalyzes the sentence into simpler and simpler components, eventually\nreaching an atomic formula (together with an appropriate variable\nassignment). Therefore GTS allows accounting for semantic\ncontext-dependencies that violate the principle of\n compositionality.[52]\n\nIn \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) an existential quantifier may depend only on\nsome of the universal quantifiers in whose scope it lies.\nAccordingly, its interpretation depends on its relation to quantifiers\noutside its own scope. Such an existential quantifier is\n context-dependent.[53]\n On the face of it, then, \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) cannot but violate the\nprinciple of compositionality and does not admit of a Tarski-type\ntruth-definition. \n\nHodges (1997a,b) showed, however, that \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) can be given a\ncompositional\n semantics.[54]\n The semantics is given by recursively defining the satisfaction\nrelation \u2018\\(M \\vDash_X \\phi\\)\u2019 (read: \\(\\phi\\) is\nsatisfied in \\(M\\) by \\(X)\\), where \\(X\\) is a set of\nvariable assignments. While the Tarskian semantics for \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\)\nis in terms of single variable assignments, Hodges\u2019s semantics\nemploys sets of variable assignments. The game-theoretical semantics\nof \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) is captured by this compositional semantics: for\nevery formula \\(\\phi\\) of \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\), player 2 has a winning\nstrategy in \\(G(\\phi , M, g)\\) iff the condition \\(M \\vDash_{\\{g\\}}\n\\phi\\) holds. Due to Hodges\u2019s semantic clauses for existential\nquantifiers and disjunctions involving independence indications, the\nevaluation of \\(\\phi\\) relative to the singleton set \\(\\{g\\}\\)\ngenerally leads to evaluating syntactic components of \\(\\phi\\)\nrelative to sets of (possibly infinitely) many variable assignments.\nHintikka remarks (2006a: 65) that if one is sufficiently ruthless, one\ncan always save compositionality by building the laws of semantic\ninteraction of different expressions into the respective meanings of\nthose\n expressions.[55]\n\nIt is methodologically worth pointing out that compositionality is not\nneeded for defining \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\). The very existence of\n\\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) proves that rejecting compositionality is no obstacle\nfor the formulation of a powerful logic (Hintikka 1995). It should\nalso be noted that what makes Hodges\u2019s result work is its\ntype-theoretical ascent. Let us say that a Tarski-type\ncompositional semantics is a compositional semantics which interprets\neach formula \\(\\phi(x_1 ,\\ldots ,x_n)\\) of \\(n\\) free variables in\nterms of an \\(n\\)-tuple of elements of the domain. Hence the standard\nsemantics of \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\) is Tarski-type, but Hodges\u2019s\nsemantics employing the satisfaction relation \u2018\\(M \\vDash_X\n\\phi\\)\u2019 is not, because the latter evaluates a formula\n\\(\\phi(x_1 ,\\ldots ,x_n)\\) of \\(n\\) free variables relative to an\nentire set of \\(n\\)-tuples of elements. Cameron & Hodges\n(2001) proved that actually there is \\(no\\) Tarski-type compositional\nsemantics for \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\). \n\nThe notion of compositionality can be refined by imposing constraints\non the auxiliary semantic attributes. Sandu and Hintikka (2001: 60)\nsuggested, by analogy with \\(\\mathbf{FO}\\), that \u2018satisfaction\nby a single variable assignment\u2019 would be a natural auxiliary\nattribute in connection with \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\). By the result of\nCameron and Hodges, no semantics for \\(\\mathbf{IFL}\\) exists that\nwould be compositional in this restricted sense.\n",
