Why this is so, however, may not be so obvious.\nSome will say that our uncertainty about what to do in this case is\nsimply the result of uncertainty about the consequences. If we were\ncertain that the student could make a difference in defeating the\nGermans, the obligation to join the military would prevail. But if the\nstudent made little difference whatsoever in that cause, then his\nobligation to tend to his mother\u2019s needs would take precedence,\nsince there he is virtually certain to be helpful. Others, though,\nwill say that these obligations are equally weighty, and that\nuncertainty about the consequences is not at issue here.\n\nEthicists as diverse as Kant (1971/1797), Mill (1979/1861), and Ross\n(1930, 1939) have assumed that an adequate moral theory should not\nallow for the possibility of genuine moral dilemmas. Only\nrecently\u2014in the last sixty years or so\u2014have philosophers\nbegun to challenge that assumption. And the challenge can take at\nleast two different forms. Some will argue that it is not\npossible to preclude genuine moral dilemmas. Others will argue\nthat even if it were possible, it is not desirable to do\nso.\n\nTo illustrate some of the debate that occurs regarding whether it is\npossible for any theory to eliminate genuine moral dilemmas, consider\nthe following. The conflicts in Plato\u2019s case and in\nSartre\u2019s case arose because there is more than one moral precept\n(using \u2018precept\u2019 to designate rules and principles), more\nthan one precept sometimes applies to the same situation, and in some\nof these cases the precepts demand conflicting actions. One obvious\nsolution here would be to arrange the precepts, however many there\nmight be, hierarchically. By this scheme, the highest ordered precept\nalways prevails, the second prevails unless it conflicts with the\nfirst, and so on. There are at least two glaring problems with this\nobvious solution, however. First, it just does not seem credible to\nhold that moral rules and principles should be hierarchically ordered.\nWhile the requirements to keep one\u2019s promises and to prevent\nharm to others clearly can conflict, it is far from clear that one of\nthese requirements should always prevail over the other. In\nthe Platonic case, the obligation to prevent harm is clearly stronger.\nBut there can easily be cases where the harm that can be prevented is\nrelatively mild and the promise that is to be kept is very important.\nAnd most other pairs of precepts are like this. This was a point made\nby Ross in The Right and the Good (1930, Chapter 2).\n\nThe second problem with this easy solution is deeper. Even if it were\nplausible to arrange moral precepts hierarchically, situations can\narise in which the same precept gives rise to conflicting obligations.\nPerhaps the most widely discussed case of this sort is taken from\nWilliam Styron\u2019s Sophie\u2019s Choice (1980,\n528\u2013529; see Greenspan 1983 and Tessman 2015, 160\u2013163).\nSophie and her two children are at a Nazi concentration camp. A guard\nconfronts Sophie and tells her that one of her children will be\nallowed to live and one will be killed. But it is Sophie who must\ndecide which child will be killed. Sophie can prevent the death of\neither of her children, but only by condemning the other to be killed.\nThe guard makes the situation even more excruciating by informing\nSophie that if she chooses neither, then both will be killed. With\nthis added factor, Sophie has a morally compelling reason to choose\none of her children. But for each child, Sophie has an apparently\nequally strong reason to save him or her. Thus the same moral precept\ngives rise to conflicting obligations. Some have called such cases\nsymmetrical (Sinnott-Armstrong 1988, Chapter 2).\n",
