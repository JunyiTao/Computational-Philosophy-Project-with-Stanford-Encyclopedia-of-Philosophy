Epistemic Authority, Epistemic Injustice, Epistemologies of Ignorance, and Virtue Epistemology\n\nNaturalized epistemology considers the effects of our pervasive\nepistemic interdependence (Nelson 1990). Because inquiry is\ncollaborative and reliant on testimony, what we believe is influenced\nby who we believe. Who we believe depends on attributions of epistemic\nauthority, which rely on views about people\u2019s expertise,\nepistemic responsibility, and trustworthiness. Feminist\nepistemologists explore how gender and other hierarchical social\nrelations influence attributions of epistemic authority, considering\ntheir impact on (1) general models of knowledge; (2) the epistemic\nstanding of knowers; (3) whose claims various epistemic communities do\nand ought to accept; and (4) how this affects the distribution of\nknowledge and ignorance in society. Some of these effects amount to\nepistemic injustice against members of subordinated groups.\nSome feminist epistemologists have advanced conceptions of virtue\nepistemology to remedy epistemic injustice and ignorance.\n\nEpistemic Authority and General Models of Knowledge. Gendered\nideas about epistemic authority can distort our general models of\nknowledge. Code (1991) argues that contemporary analytic\nepistemology\u2019s core model of propositional knowledge implicitly\npresupposes a male knower. The instances of knowledge analytic\nepistemology takes to be paradigmatic when it analyzes the formula\n\u201cS knows that P\u201d are propositions about readily observable\nmind-independent objects. To take these as the paradigmatic instances\nof knowledge invites a model of the knower as masculine, in adopting\nthe symbolically masculine objectivity package described above. This\nimplicitly denies epistemic authority to women. Code argues that\nknowledge of other persons rather than of propositions should be taken\nas a primary model of knowledge. Such second-person knowledge calls\nthe implicit masculinity of knowers into question, since getting to\nknow others typically requires intimacy, dialogue, empathy and other\ncharacteristics gender symbolized as \u201cfeminine.\u201d\n\nRecent epistemology\u2019s focus on the indispensability of testimony\nto inquiry has led feminist epistemologists to take Code\u2019s ideas\nin a different direction, by investigating the dependence of\npropositional knowledge on knowledge of persons. For example,\nanthropologists must cultivate personal relationships of trust with\nnative informants to gain access to the natives\u2019 situated\nknowledge of their cultures. This requires reflection on the ways\ndifferences in power, interest, and social situation between\nanthropologists and their informants influence testimony its\ninterpretation. Feminist epistemologists question models of testimony\nas transparent and unidirectional, highlighting testimony\u2019s\ndialogic, strategic, and empathetic features, as well as the\nimportance and difficulty of cultivating epistemically fruitful\nrelations of mutual trust across differences in power (Bergin 2002;\nLugones 1987).\n\nEpistemic Injustice. Other feminist epistemologists focus on\nthe impact of gender and other hierarchical relations on attributions\nof epistemic authority. Dominant groups tend to accord epistemic\nauthority to themselves and withhold it from subordinates by\nconstructing stigmatizing stereotypes of subordinates as incompetent\nor dishonest. They promote, as markers of epistemic authority,\ncharacteristics stereotypically thought to be distinctively theirs\n(Addelson 1983; Shapin 1994). They hoard opportunities for gaining\naccess to these markers\u2014for instance, by denying subordinate\ngroups access to higher education. Such practices commit epistemic\ninjustice against members of subordinate groups, undermining their\nability to participate in collaborative inquiry. Fricker (2007) calls\nthis \u201ctestimonial injustice.\u201d In the core case of\ntestimonial injustice, people discount the credibility of what others\nsay on account of prejudice against their social group. Dotson (2011)\ndistinguishes two kinds of testimonial injustice, silencing and\nsmothering. Silencing follows Fricker\u2019s model, whereas\nsmothering is a kind of self-censorship to protect oneself or\none\u2019s group from prejudicial misunderstanding. For example,\nwomen of color victimized by domestic violence might not to testify to\nwhites about this, to avoid reinforcing white prejudice against black\nmen. Hookway (2010) identifies epistemic injustice in practices that\nexclude people from participating in inquiry in non-testimonial ways,\nsuch as asking questions, suggesting hypotheses, raising objections,\nand drawing analogies. When others fail to take such contributions\nseriously out of prejudicial stereotyping of the contributor, this\ninjustice injures the speaker not as a knower but as an inquirer.\n\nHermeneutical injustice occurs when the interpretive\nresources available to a community render a person\u2019s experiences\nunintelligible or misunderstood, due to the epistemic marginalization\nof that person or members of her social group from participation in\npractices of meaning-making (Fricker 2007). An example of\nhermeneutical injustice is the dismissal of women as humorless or\nhypersensitive for getting upset at what was seen as mere cloddish\ncourtship or joking, before the concept of sexual harassment was\navailable to make sense of their experiences. This was an injustice\nbecause the victims of harassment were prejudicially denied effective\naccess to the practices of meaning-making whereby they could have made\ntheir experiences intelligible to others. Mason (2011) argues that\nmarginalized communities may have hermeneutical resources in which\ntheir oppression is understood as such, but still suffer hermeneutical\ninjustice if the dominant community fails to take up these resources\nby according epistemic authority to the marginalized. Pohlhaus (2011)\nargues that such ignorance can be willful, leading to contributory\ninjustice, an intentional maintenance of inadequate hermeneutical\nresources that harmfully obstructs the uptake of resources the\noppressed have developed to make sense of their experience (Dotson\n2012). \n\nEpistemologies of Ignorance. Ignorance, like knowledge, has\nsystematic patterns and social-structural causes (Pohlhaus 2011,\nProctor & Schiebinger 2008, Sullivan & Tuana 2007, Tuana &\nSullivan 2006). Injustice in according people status as knowers and\ninquirers generates systematic ignorance that damages the interests of\nsubordinated groups. Society could have access to, but forget or\nsuppress, knowledge useful to subordinated groups\u2014for example, about\nplants that are effective abortifactants (Schiebinger 2007). Since\naccurate information on such matters is or was available, explanation\nis needed for why it is forgotten. Ignorance is sometimes due to to\nsegregation of situated knowers, preventing knowledge or\nunderstandings held by subordinate groups from disseminating (Margonis\n2007). Members of subordinated groups may have strategic interests in\nhiding knowledge about themselves from dominant groups (Bailey 2007).\nMost importantly, dominant groups have interests in avoiding the truth\nabout their own injustices (Mills 2007).\n\nVirtue epistemology. Some feminist epistemologists advance\nideals of epistemic virtue to address epistemic injustice. Fricker\n(2007) argues that to correct for testimonial injustice, hearers need\nto cultivate the virtue of epistemic justice\u2014a disposition,\nrooted in one\u2019s testimonial sensibility or second-nature\nperception of others\u2019 credibility, to neutralize the effects of\nprejudicial stereotypes on credibility judgments. Jones (2002)\nproposes rules for checking such biases when confronted with\nsurprising testimony. These include undertaking independent\nassessments of the credibility of the witness and the plausibility of\nwhat they say; and letting the presumption against accepting\nastonishing testimony be rebutted when one has good reason to distrust\none\u2019s distrust of the witness. Alcoff (2010) suggests that\ncorrecting for testimonial injustice requires adopting standpoint\nepistemology: one must not merely neutralize prejudice, but accord\nepistemic privilege to the marginalized. Kwong (2015) stresses the\nvirtue of open-mindedness, and Daukas (2011) of trustworthiness, while\nSholock (2012) explores the importance of the dominant being disposed\nto acknowledge their own ignorance of the situated knowledge of the\noppressed, so that they seek the latter\u2019s testimony, and extend\nepistemic authority to them. A key theme of feminist virtue\nepistemology is its aspiration to cultivate dispositions that enable\ninquirers to produce knowledge that can overcome oppression (Daukas\n2018).\n\nSome theorists have questioned suggestions to remedy epistemic\ninjustice with individual virtues. We must share responsibility for\ndevising epistemic practices of resistance to epistemic injustice\n(Medina 2013). A structural conception of remedies does not preclude\nthe use of virtue epistemology to address structural epistemic\ninjustice, as long as epistemic institutions and systems can be\nbearers of epistemic virtue (Anderson 2012).\n",
