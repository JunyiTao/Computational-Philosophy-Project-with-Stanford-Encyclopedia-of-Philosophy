    "main_text": "The Nature of Modality\n2. The Nature of Modality\n\nWe have now seen two competing accounts of Spinoza\u2019s views about\nthe modal status of finite objects. Some argue that Spinoza endorses a\nstrong form of determinism that falls short of full-blown\nnecessitarianism. On this reading, finite modes do not exist\nnecessarily and there are alternative possibilities to the series of\nactual finite modes that God did not bring about. Others have argued\nthat Spinoza\u2019s account of the relationship between God and\nfinite modes readily accommodates full-blown necessitarianism and\nthat, given the large number of passages in which Spinoza appears to\naffirm necessitarianism without qualification, there is\nsufficient evidence that Spinoza intentionally endorsed\nfull-blown necessitarianism.\n\nLike almost all discussions of Spinoza\u2019s modal commitments, this\ndispute focus on the distribution of modal properties: which\nthings exist necessarily? Far less attention has been given to\nSpinoza\u2019s account of the nature of modality. This\nsection discusses whether Spinoza has an account of modality itself,\nand if so, what light that account sheds on the dispute over his\nalleged necessitarianism.\n\nSpinoza is emphatic that particular modal ascriptions have reasons\nbehind them: \u201cA thing is called necessary either by reason of\nits essence or by reason of its cause\u201d (Ip33s1). But we\ncan also consider a higher-order question: for what\nreason(s) do modal ascriptions work in the way that Spinoza claims\nthey do? For ease, let us focus on modal properties instead\nof modal ascriptions. The question is similar to the one raised\nearlier about causation. What explains causation itself? Arguably,\nSpinoza\u2019s answer is that causal relations obtain in virtue of\nconceptual connections between causal relata. A parallel question can\nbe raised about modality itself. Do basic modal properties obtain in\nvirtue of other, non-modal properties or is modality primitive for\nSpinoza?\n\nGiven Spinoza\u2019s embrace of the PSR and his efforts to explain\nother dependence relations (such as causation and, perhaps,\ninherence), it would be surprising and disappointing if modality got a\nfree explanatory pass. Of course, we probably should not expect\nSpinoza to have anything like a full-blown theory of modality in the\nforms that contemporary metaphysicians now provide (for an example,\nsee the entry on the\n possibilism-actualism debate).\n Only in recent decades have philosophers come to appreciate how\ncomplex and rich the metaphysics of modality is, and Spinoza would be\nin good company if he says things that seem, by today\u2019s\nstandards, mostly underdeveloped. Nonetheless, he may have the\nbeginnings of an account that helps illuminate his other modal\ncommitments.\n\nA promising place to start is the modal status of God\u2019s\nexistence. In Ip11, Spinoza claims that God necessarily exists. But\nwhat is it in virtue of which God necessarily exists? This might sound\nlike an odd question. Once explanations reach a necessarily existing\nobject, are there further in virtue of questions to be asked\nabout that object\u2019s existence? More generally, when we reach\nnecessity, haven\u2019t we reached the end of\n explanations?[14]\n Not always: mathematics is full of asymmetrical\nexplanatory relations among necessarily true propositions.\nSimilarly, Spinoza thinks that substance causes and asymmetrically\nexplains necessarily existing infinite modes. Hence Spinoza must\nbelieve that dependence and explanation are more fine-grained\nrelations than modern logical entailment, since according to the\nlatter, every necessary proposition entails and is entailed by every\nother necessary proposition.\n\nSpinoza explains the necessity of God\u2019s existence by appealing\nto God\u2019s nature. This may sound like a non-answer, but it is\nnot. Spinoza is not claiming that there are no explanatory grounds for\nGod\u2019s existence; he is claiming that facts about God\u2019s\nnature explain the modality of God\u2019s existence. What about\nGod\u2019s nature explains God\u2019s existence? In Ip7 and Ip11,\nSpinoza appeals to an involvement relation between the concept of\nGod\u2019s essence and the concept of God\u2019s existence. That is,\nGod exists in virtue of the fact that the concept of God involves the\nconcept of existence. Spinoza also thinks that the conceptual\ninvolvement relation between God and existence explains the fact that\nGod necessarily exists. In Ip19d, Spinoza writes,\n\nFor God (by Id6) is substance, which (by Ip11) necessarily exists,\nthat is (by p7), to whose nature it pertains to exist, or (what is the\nsame) from whose definition it follows that he exists.\n\n\nIn Ip7, Spinoza equates \u201cpertaining to its nature to\nexist\u201d with \u201cessence necessarily involving\nexistence\u201d and \u201ccausing itself.\u201d Self-causation in\nturn is explained in Id1 as a \u201cnature that cannot be conceived\nexcept as existing.\u201d That is, what explains the necessity of\nGod\u2019s existence is the fact that the very concept of God\ninvolves the concept of existence. He repeats these connections in\nIp24d, \u201cFor that whose nature involves existence (considered in\nitself) is its own cause, and exists only from the necessity of its\nnature.\u201d In other words, Spinoza explains necessity in terms of\nconceptual connections. Although Spinoza does not develop a richer\naccount of conceptual relations that Leibniz will later achieve, his\ngeneral idea seems to be that conceptual relations are the relations\nthat explain and ground necessary connections.\n\nSpinoza makes similar appeals to conceptual relations when he invokes\ngeometrical examples to describe the necessity with which other things\nfollow from God:\n\n\u2026all things have necessarily flowed, or always follow, by the\nsame necessity and in the same way as from the nature of a triangle it\nfollows\u2026that its three angles are equal to two right angles\n(Ip17s).\n\n\nSpinoza later identifies this same geometrical relationship with the\nconceptual involvement relation (IIp49). What it is for things to\nfollow from God necessarily is for those things to be (asymmetrically)\nconceived through God, whose concept involves (the concept of)\nexistence. The necessity of God and the necessity of existing things\nare both explained by and grounded in conceptual relations. Spinoza\nmakes this connection emphatic in Ip35, \u201cWhatever we conceive to\nbe in God\u2019s power, necessarily exists.\u201d\n\nConversely, contingency obtains in virtue of the lack of certain\nconceptual connections. In the case of contingent existence, an object\nexists contingently just in case its concept is neither connected to\nthe concept of existence nor to something else whose concept is\nconnected to the concept of existence. Hence if a mode is\nconceived in such a way that it is not conceived in relation to\nsomething involving existence, it will exist contingently and not\nnecessarily (as per Ia7). The point is not just that it would be\nconceived as contingent. On this account, how a thing is\nconceived partly fixes its modal status. In explaining modal features\nin terms of an involvement relation between concepts, Spinoza provides\nan answer to (3) from the previous section and thereby identifies\nhimself with a long and distinguished tradition of philosophers who\nexplain modal facts by appeal to conceptual relations.\n\nThis account also explains why Spinoza is attracted to his modal\ntransfer principle in the first place. Recall that the modal transfer\nprinciple states that necessity transfers along following-from chains\nwhose nodes include at least one necessarily existing thing. We saw\nearlier that Spinoza\u2019s following-from relation is a causal\nrelation and that causal relations are conceptual relations for\nSpinoza. But we just saw that necessity is also partly a function of\nconceptual relations. Thus necessity transfers along following-from\nchains because both necessity and following-from are grounded in the\nsame relations of conceptual involvement. The underlying conceptual\nnature of modality, causation, and following-from explains why\nSpinoza\u2019s modal transfer principle works.\n\nAnother upshot of all this is that modality is not wholly extensional\nfor Spinoza. The ways in which objects are conceived partly determines\na thing\u2019s modal status. In particular, whether a finite mode\nexists necessarily or not depends in part on whether it is conceived\nthrough something whose concept involves existence.
