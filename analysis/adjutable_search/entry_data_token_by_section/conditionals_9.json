    "main_text": "Truth Conditions Revisited || A Special Assertability Condition\n4.2 A Special Assertability Condition\n\nFrank Jackson holds that \u201cIf \\(A, B\\)\u201d has the truth\nconditions of \u201c\\(A \\supset B\\)\u201d, i.e. \u201c\\({\\sim}A\\)\nor \\(B\\)\u201d; but it is part of its meaning that it is governed by\na special rule of assertability. \u201cIf\u201d is assimilated to\nwords like \u201cbut\u201d, \u201cnevertheless\u201d and\n\u201ceven\u201d. \u201c\\(A\\) but \\(B\\)\u201d has the same truth\nconditions as \u201c\\(A\\) and \\(B\\)\u201d, yet they differ in\nmeaning: \u201cbut\u201d is used to signal a contrast between \\(A\\)\nand \\(B\\). When \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are true and the contrast is lacking,\n\u201c\\(A\\) but \\(B\\)\u201d is true but inappropriate. Likewise,\n\u201cEven John can understand this proof\u201d is true when John\ncan understand this proof, but inappropriate when John is a\nworld-class logician. \n\nAccording to Jackson, in asserting \u201cIf \\(A, B\\)\u201d the\nspeaker expresses his belief that \\(A \\supset B\\), and also indicates\nthat this belief is \u201crobust\u201d with respect to the\nantecedent \\(A\\). In Jackson\u2019s early work (1979, 1980)\n\u201crobustness\u201d was explained thus: the speaker would not\nabandon his belief that \\(A \\supset B\\) if he were to learn that\n\\(A\\). This, it was claimed, amounted to the speaker\u2019s having a\nhigh probability for \\(A \\supset B\\) given \\(A\\), i.e. for\n\\(({\\sim}A\\) or \\(B)\\) given \\(A\\), which is just to have a high\nprobability for \\(B\\) given \\(A\\). Thus, assertability goes by\nconditional probability. Robustness was meant to ensure that an\nassertable conditional is fit for modus ponens. Robustness is not\nsatisfied if you believe \\(A \\supset B\\) solely on the grounds that\n\\({\\sim}A\\). Then, if you discover that \\(A\\), you will abandon your\nbelief in \\(A \\supset B\\) rather than conclude that \\(B\\).\n\nJackson came to realise, however, that there are assertable\nconditionals which one would not continue to believe if one learned\nthe antecedent. I say \u201cIf Reagan worked for the KGB, I\u2019ll\nnever find out\u201d (Lewis\u2019s example (1986, p. 155)). My\nconditional probability for consequent given antecedent is high. But\nif I were to discover that the antecedent is true, I would abandon the\nconditional belief, rather than conclude that I will never find out\nthat the antecedent is true. So, in Jackson\u2019s later work (1987),\nrobustness with respect to \\(A\\) is simply defined as \\(\\mathbf{p}_A\n(A \\supset B)\\) being high, which is trivially equivalent to\n\\(\\mathbf{p}_A (B)\\) being high. In most cases, though, the earlier\nexplanation will hold good.\n\nWhat do we need the truth-functional truth conditions for? Do they\nexplain the meaning of compounds of conditionals? According to\nJackson, they do not (1987, p. 129). We know what \u201c\\(A \\supset\nB\\)\u201d means, as a constituent in complex sentences. But\n\u201c\\(A \\supset B\\)\u201d does not mean the same as \u201cIf \\(A,\nB\\)\u201d. The latter has a special assertability condition. And his\ntheory has no implications about what, if anything, \u201cif \\(A,\nB\\)\u201d means when it occurs, unasserted, as a constituent in a\nlonger sentence.\n\n(Here his analogy with \u201cbut\u201d etc. fails. \u201cBut\u201d\ncan occur in unasserted clauses: \u201cEither he arrived on time but\ndidn\u2019t wait for us, or he never arrived at all\u201d (see Woods\n(1997, p. 61)). It also occurs in questions and commands: \u201cShut\nthe door but leave the window open\u201d. \u201cDoes anyone want\neggs but no ham?\u201d. \u201cBut\u201d means \u201cand in\ncontrast\u201d. Its meaning is not given by an \u201cassertability\ncondition\u201d.)\n\nDo the truth-functional truth conditions explain the validity of\narguments involving conditionals? Not in a way that accords well with\nintuition, we have seen. Jackson claims that our intuitions are at\nfault here: we confuse preservation of truth and preservation of\nassertability (1987, pp. 50\u20131).\n\nNor is there any direct evidence for Jackson\u2019s theory. Nobody\nwho thinks the Republicans won\u2019t win treats \u201cIf the\nRepublicans win, they will double income tax\u201d as inappropriate\nbut probably true, in the same category as \u201cEven G\u00f6del\nunderstood truth-functional logic\u201d. Jackson is aware of this. He\nseems to advocate an error theory of conditionals: ordinary linguistic\nbehaviour fits the false theory that there is a proposition \\(A*B\\)\nsuch that \\(\\mathbf{p}(A*B) = \\mathbf{p}_A (B)\\) (1987, pp.\n39\u201340). If this is his view, he cannot hold that his own theory\nis a psychologically accurate account of what people do when they use\nconditionals. Perhaps it is an account of how we should use\nconditionals, and would if we were free from error: we should\naccept that \u201cIf the Republicans win they will double income\ntax\u201d is probably true when it is probable that the Republicans\nwon\u2019t win. Would we gain anything from following this\nprescription? It is hard to see that we would: we would deprive\nourselves of the ability to discriminate between believable and\nunbelievable conditionals whose antecedents we think false.\n\nFor Jackson\u2019s more recent thoughts on conditionals see his\npostscript (1998, pp. 51\u201354). See also Edgington (2009) and\nJackson\u2019s reply (2009, pp. 463\u20136). \n",
