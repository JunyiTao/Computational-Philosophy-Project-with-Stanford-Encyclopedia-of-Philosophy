Say there are some alternatives to choose among. They\ncould be policies, public projects, candidates in an election,\ndistributions of income and labour requirements among the members of a\nsociety, or just about anything else. There are some people whose\npreferences will inform this choice, and the question is: which\nprocedures are there for deriving, from what is known or can be found\nout about their preferences, a collective or \u201csocial\u201d\nordering of the alternatives from better to worse? The answer is\nstartling. Arrow\u2019s theorem says there are no such procedures\nwhatsoever\u2014none, anyway, that satisfy certain apparently quite\nreasonable assumptions concerning the autonomy of the people and the\nrationality of their preferences. The technical framework in which\nArrow gave the question of social orderings a precise sense and its\nrigorous answer is now widely used for studying problems in welfare\neconomics. The impossibility theorem itself set much of the agenda for\ncontemporary social choice theory. Arrow accomplished this while still\na graduate student. In 1972, he received the Nobel Prize in economics\nfor his contributions.\n",
