Theories of Cognitive Development\n\nAny well-worked out epistemology will provide at least the materials\nfor a theory of cognitive development in childhood. Thus, according to\nRen\u00e9 Descartes, a clear and distinct knowledge of the world can\nbe constructed from resources innate to the human mind (Descartes, PW,\n131). John Locke, by contrast, maintains that the human mind begins as\na \u201cwhite paper, void of all characters, without any ideas\u201d\n(Locke, EHC, 121). On this view all the \u201cmaterials of reason and\nknowledge\u201d come from experience. Locke\u2019s denial of the\ndoctrine of innate ideas was, no doubt, directed specifically at\nDescartes and the Cartesians. But it also implies a rejection of the\nPlatonic doctrine that learning is a recollection of previously known\nForms. Few theorists of cognitive development today find either the\nextreme empiricism of Locke or the strong innatism of Plato or\nDescartes completely acceptable.\n\nBehaviorism has offered recent theorists of cognitive development a\nway to be strongly empiricist without appealing to Locke\u2019s inner\ntheater of the mind. The behaviorist program was, however, dealt a\nmajor setback when Noam Chomsky, in his review (1959) of\nSkinner\u2019s Verbal Behavior (1957), argued successfully\nthat no purely behaviorist account of language-learning is possible.\nChomsky\u2019s alternative, a theory of Universal Grammar, which owes\nsome of its inspiration to Plato and Descartes, has made the idea of\ninnate language structures, and perhaps other cognitive structures as\nwell, seem a viable alternative to a more purely empiricist conception\nof cognitive development.\n\nIt is, however, the work of Jean Piaget that has been most influential\non the way psychologists, educators, and even philosophers have come\nto think about the cognitive development of children. Piaget\u2019s\nearly work, The Child\u2019s Conception of the World (1929),\nmakes especially clear how philosophically challenging the work of a\ndevelopmental psychologist can be. Although his project is always to\nlay out identifiable stages in which children come to understand what,\nsay, causality or thinking or whatever is, the intelligibility of his\naccount presupposes that there are satisfactory responses to the\nphilosophical quandaries that topics like causality, thinking, and\nlife raise.\n\nTake the concept of life. According to Piaget this concept is acquired\nin four stages (Piaget, 1929, Chapter 6)\n\nFirst Stage: Life is assimilated to activity in general\nSecond Stage: Life is assimilated to movement\nThird Stage: Life is assimilated to spontaneous movement\nFourth Stage: Life is restricted to animals and plants\n\n\nThese distinctions are suggestive, but they invite much more\ndiscussion than Piaget elicits from his child subjects. What is\nrequired for movement to be spontaneous? Is a bear alive during\nhibernation? We may suppose the Venus flytrap moves spontaneously. But\ndoes it really? What about other plants? And then there is the\nquestion of what Piaget can mean by calling the thinking of young\nchildren \u201canimistic,\u201d if, at their stage of cognitive\ndevelopment, their idea of life is simply \u201cassimilated to\nactivity in general.\u201d\n\nDonaldson (1978) offers a psychological critique of Piaget on\ncognitive development. A philosophical critique of Piaget\u2019s work\non cognitive development is to be found in Chapters 3 and 4 of\nMatthews (1994). Interesting post-Piagetian work in cognitive\ndevelopment includes Cary (1985), Wellman (1990), Flavel (1995),\nSubbotsky (1996), and Gelman (2003).\n\nPsychological research on concept formation has suggested that\nchildren do not generally form concepts by learning necessary and\nsufficient conditions for their application, but rather by coming to\nuse prototypical examples as reference guides. Thus a robin (rather,\nof course, than a penguin) might be the child\u2019s prototype for\n\u2018bird\u2019. The child, like the adult, might then be credited\nwith having the concept, bird, without the child\u2019s ever being\nable to specify, successfully, necessary and sufficient conditions for\nsomething to count as a bird. This finding seems to have implications\nfor the proper role and importance of conceptual analysis in\nphilosophy. It is also a case in which we should let what we come to\nknow about cognitive development in children help shape our\nepistemology, rather than counting on our antecedently formulated\nepistemology to shape our conception of cognitive development in\nchildren (see Rosch and Lloyd, 1978, and Gelman, 2003).\n\nSome developmental psychologists have recently moved away from the\nidea that children are to be understood primarily as human beings who\nlack the capacities adults of their species normally have. This change\nis striking in, for example, the work of Alison Gopnik, who writes:\n\u201cChildren aren\u2019t just defective adults, primitive grownups\ngradually attaining our perfection and complexity. Instead, children\nand adults are different forms of homo sapiens. They have very\ndifferent, though equally complex and powerful, minds, brains, and\nforms of consciousness, designed to serve different evolutionary\nfunctions\u201d (Gopnik, 2009, 9). Part of this new respect for the\ncapacities of children rests on neuroscience and an increased\nappreciation for the complexity of the brains of infants and young\nchildren. Thus Gopnik writes: \u201cBabies\u2019 brains are actually\nmore highly connected than adult brains; more neural pathways are\navailable to babies than adults.\u201d (11)\n",
