Once we\nhave deliberated and formed judgments about what is right or\nwrong, good or bad, these judgments tend to\nhave a marked hold on us. Although in the end, we do not always behave\nas we think we ought, our moral judgments typically motivate us, at\nleast to some degree, to act in accordance with them. When\nphilosophers talk about moral motivation, this is the basic phenomenon\nthat they seek to understand. Moral motivation is an instance of a\nmore general phenomenon\u2014what we might call normative\nmotivation\u2014for our other normative judgments also typically\nhave some motivating force. When we make the normative judgment that\nsomething is good for us, or that we have a reason\nto act in a particular way, or that a specific course of action is the\nrational course, we also tend to be moved. Many philosophers\nhave regarded the motivating force of normative judgments as the key\nfeature that marks them as normative, thereby distinguishing\nthem from the many other judgments we make. In contrast to our\nnormative judgments, our mathematical and empirical judgments, for\nexample, seem to have no intrinsic connection to motivation and\naction. The belief that an antibiotic will cure a specific infection\nmay move an individual to take the antibiotic, if she also believes\nthat she has the infection, and if she either desires to be cured or\njudges that she ought to treat the infection for her own good. All on\nits own, however, an empirical belief like this one appears to carry\nwith it no particular motivational impact; a person can judge that an\nantibiotic will most effectively cure a specific infection without\nbeing moved one way or another. \n\nAlthough motivating force may be a distinguishing feature of normative\njudgments, the phenomenon of normative motivation seems most\nsignificant in the case of narrowly moral judgments. Moral\nmotivation has, in any case, received far greater attention than\nmotivation in connection with other normative judgments. Morality is\nwidely believed to conflict, frequently and sometimes severely, with\nwhat an agent most values or most prefers to do. Perhaps because of\nthe apparent opposition between self-interest and morality, the fact\nof moral motivation has seemed especially puzzling. How is it that we\nare so reliably moved by our moral judgments? And what is the precise\nnature of the connection between moral judgment and motivation? Of\ncourse, the less puzzling and more mundane moral motivation comes to\nseem, the more puzzling failures of moral motivation become.\nIf we are to explain moral motivation, we will need to understand not\nonly how moral judgments so regularly succeed in motivating, but how\nthey can fail to motivate, sometimes rather spectacularly. Not only do\nwe witness motivational failure among the deranged, dejected, and\nconfused, but also, it appears, among the fully sound and\nself-possessed. What are we to make of the\n\u201camoralist\u201d\u2014the apparently rational, strong willed\nindividual who seemingly makes moral judgments, while remaining\nutterly indifferent? \n\nIn answering the foregoing questions, philosophers have been led to\nsharply differing views about moral motivation, and these views have\nsometimes been thought to have important implications for foundational\nissues in ethics. More precisely, differing views about moral\nmotivation involve commitment to particular theses which have been\nthought to bear on questions about moral semantics and the nature of\nmorality. Perhaps most famously, certain theses have been jointly\ndeployed to support skeptical or anti-realist views in\nmetaethics. This entry provides an overview of the main positions\nphilosophers have taken in their efforts to understand and explain the\nphenomenon of moral motivation. It also briefly explains how key\ntheses concerning moral motivation have come to inform and structure\ndebates about moral semantics and the nature of morality.\n", "toc": [{"#BasPheMorMot": "1.

The Basic Phenomenon of Moral Motivation\n\nThe basic phenomenon of moral motivation might be given a more\nsystematic depiction as follows, using \u2018P\u2019 to\nstand for some person or individual and \u2018\u03c6\u2019 and\n\u2018\u03c8\u2019 each to stand for some action:\n\nWhen P judges that it would be morally right to \u03c6, she is\nordinarily motivated to \u03c6; should P later become\nconvinced that it would be wrong to \u03c6 and right to \u03c8 instead,\nshe ordinarily ceases to be motivated to \u03c6 and comes to be\nmotivated to \u03c8.\n\nThis depiction aims to capture features of our common experience. As\nobservation suggests, people generally feel moved to do what they\njudge it right to do; what is more, their motivation ordinarily shifts\nto match or \u201ctrack\u201d changes in their moral judgments. If\nan individual judges it right to keep a promise rather than to aid a\nstranger in need, she will ordinarily feel moved, at least to some\ndegree, to act so as to fulfill the promise. If she comes to change\nher mind about the priority of her promise, she will ordinarily no\nlonger be moved to keep the promise and will be moved instead to\nprovide aid.\n\nBefore we turn to the many questions which the foregoing depiction\nleaves open, and which lie at the heart of debates about the nature of\nmoral motivation, we should make note of two important points. First,\nthe depiction says nothing about the strength of moral\nmotivation. For all that it tells us, the motivation all or some\npeople feel to do what they judge right might be extraordinarily weak.\nCommon experience suggests that moral motivation in fact tends to be\nfairly robust, but with one qualification to be noted later,\nphilosophical views about moral motivation generally follow the\ndepiction in taking no position regarding the exact strength of moral\nmotivation. Second, the depiction reflects a widely shared assumption,\none which forms part of the backdrop for debates about the nature of\nmoral motivation, namely, that moral motivation is a strikingly\nregular and reliable phenomenon. Throughout social life, in both\nour personal relations and our public interactions, we take it for\ngranted that moral judgments dependably, if not unfailingly, motivate,\nthat they effectively influence and guide how people feel and act.\nStill, the assumption is not wholly uncontroversial; indeed, some have\nexpressed serious doubts regarding whether moral motivation is as\nregular and reliable as we commonly suppose (Copp 1997, 50).\n\nThe basic phenomenon of moral motivation seems relatively\nstraightforward. The difficult philosophical task becomes one of\nattempting to understand and explain more fully and precisely the\nnature of moral motivation. Sections 2 and 3 explore two approaches to\nthe task. While the approach discussed in section 3 has been\npredominant, the approach to be considered briefly in section 2\nprovides an instructive contrast, as well as a useful first glimpse of\nhow ideas about moral motivation have been thought to bear on broader\nmetaethical questions. Section 4 explores more general considerations\nabout moral motivation and metaethics, while section 5 considers\nalleged implications for philosophical theories about moral motivation\nfrom recent work in empirical psychology. \n2. Moral Motivation and the Nature of Moral Properties\n\nWhen we judge that an action is right or wrong or that a state of\naffairs is good or bad, we seem to represent the world as being a\ncertain way. We seem to express a moral belief, attributing a\nparticular moral property or normative characteristic to the action or\nstate of affairs. Taking the apparent representational form of moral\njudgments as our lead, we might try to explain moral motivation by\nappealing to the nature of the properties that figure in our\nmoral judgments. Perhaps we are reliably motivated by our moral\njudgments, at least when those judgments are roughly correct, because\nmoral properties like rightness and goodness\nthemselves motivate us, when we apprehend them.\n\nJ.L. Mackie (1977) famously criticizes this picture of moral\nproperties in his extended argument against the objectivity of ethics.\nMackie claims to find something like it in the work of a number of\nhistorical figures, including Kant and Sidgwick, but his clearest\npresentation of the picture comes in his remarks about Plato. Mackie\nwrites: \u201cIn Plato\u2019s theory the Forms, and in particular\nthe Form of the Good, are eternal, extra-mental, realities. They are a\nvery central structural element in the fabric of the world. But it is\nheld also that just knowing them or \u2018seeing\u2019 them will not\nmerely tell men what to do but will ensure that they do it, overruling\nany contrary inclinations. The philosopher-kings in the\nRepublic can, Plato thinks, be trusted with unchecked power\nbecause their education will have given them knowledge of the Forms.\nBeing acquainted with the Forms of the Good and Justice and Beauty and\nthe rest they will, by this knowledge alone, without any further\nmotivation, be impelled to pursue and promote these ideals\u201d\n(Mackie 1977, 23\u201324).\n\nCertain features of Plato\u2019s picture of moral motivation\u2014or\nat least Mackie\u2019s characterization of it\u2014merit attention.\nFirst, as Mackie construes Plato\u2019s view, moral motivation\nsprings directly and entirely from grasping the presence of the moral\nproperties themselves. Apprehension of these properties move an agent\nto act, and to do so unaided by any additional source of motivation;\ntheir motivational power depends on no desire or disposition of the\nindividual herself. Second, apprehension of moral properties not only\nmotivates on its own: it provides overriding motivation. Once\nan agent does apprehends them, their motivating power overcomes any\nopposing desires or inclinations.\n\nIn maintaining, as he does, that Plato\u2019s theory of the Forms\ndepicts what objective values would have to be like, Mackie, in\neffect, subscribes to (and attributes to Plato) a view called\nexistence internalism. According to existence internalism, a\nnecessary connection exists between having a certain normative status\nand\n motivation.[1]\n A state of affairs couldn\u2019t be good, for example,\nunless apprehension of it was capable of motivating, though it need\nnot motivate overridingly. If an individual apprehends something and\nfails to be moved, then ceteris paribus, it isn\u2019t good.\nAs Mackie describes Plato\u2019s view, objective values provide\noverriding motivation, and so the view reflects a particularly strong\nform of existence internalism. According to that form of existence\ninternalism, a state of affairs wouldn\u2019t be good or valuable\nunless apprehension of it would provide overriding motivation. The\ninternalist character of Mackie\u2019s Platonic picture curiously\naligns it with contemporary views that similarly accept forms of\nexistence internalism, while holding that the capacity for motivation\nin fact depends on a preexisting desire. Consider a view about reasons\nassociated most prominently with Bernard Williams (1981). According to\nwhat is called internalism about reasons or reasons\ninternalism, necessarily, if an individual has a reason to do an\naction, he must be able to be motivated to do that action. On\nWilliams\u2019 view, in order to be motivated, an individual must\nhave some motivating attitude in her current \u201cmotivational\nset.\u201d Roughly speaking, then, if a consideration does not\nmotivate a person given her current desires or motivational set, it\ncannot be a reason for her to act. Both the views of Williams and of\nMackie\u2019s Plato posit a necessary connection between normative\nstatus and motivation, but the former view makes normative status\ndepend, in a way the latter view would flatly reject, on an\nindividual\u2019s subjective motives. \n\nMackie\u2019s discussion provides a first illustration of how\naccounts of moral motivation have been deployed to defend or rebut\nbroader positions in metaethics. According to Mackie, the motivating\npower of objective values, if there were such values, would have to be\njust as Plato depicted it. \u201cPlato\u2019s Forms give a dramatic\npicture of what objective values would have to be. The Form of the\nGood is such that knowledge of it provides the knower with both a\ndirection and an overriding motive; something\u2019s being good both\ntells the person who knows this to pursue it and makes him pursue it.\nAn objective good would be sought by anyone who was acquainted with\nit, not because of any contingent fact that this person, or every\nperson, is so constituted that he desires this end, but just because\nthe end has to-be-pursuedness somehow built into it\u201d (Mackie\n1977, 40). Mackie contends that the moral sentences we utter when we\nmake moral judgments in fact express propositions about just such\n\u201cobjectively prescriptive\u201d properties; as a result, our\nmoral judgments can be true or false. So moral\ncognitivism\u2014the view that moral judgments and beliefs, and\nthe sentences that express them, can be true or false\u2014provides\nthe correct account of moral semantics, of what our moral judgments\nmean. Given that our moral discourse is cognitivist, it would\nseem to presume the correctness of moral realism, the view,\nroughly, that moral judgments and beliefs are truth evaluable, and\nsome of them are literally\n true.[2]\n But moral discourse suffers from what is called \u201cpresupposition\nfailure,\u201d according to Mackie: moral discourse presupposes\nobjectively prescriptive properties, but there aren\u2019t any; such\nproperties would have to be \u201cqueer entities\u201d unlike\nanything else in the world. Talk about morality is, Mackie evidently\nthinks, rather like talk about unicorns. Our \u201cunicorn\ntalk\u201d expresses propositions (at least assuming it follows\nmedieval legend) about horse-like creatures, tamable only by virgins,\nwhose spiral horns possess magical powers. But there are no such\ncreatures, and so our unicorn talk is systematically in error, though\nfew of us any longer succumb to the error. In denying the existence of\nmoral properties, Mackie rejects moral realism, combining a\ncognitivist moral semantics with an error theory. According\nto the error theory, \u201calthough most people in making moral\njudgments implicitly claim\u2026to be pointing to something\nobjectively prescriptive, these claims are all false\u201d (Mackie\n1977,\n 35).[3]\n\nAlthough contemporary philosophers have been divided with respect to\nMackie\u2019s moral skepticism, they have mostly agreed in rejecting\nhis extremely strong claims about what moral motivation, and the\nobjective moral properties that figure in our moral judgments, would\nhave to be like. They have uniformly rejected the suggestion that a\ngrasp of morality\u2019s requirements would produce overriding\nmotivation to act accordingly. And most have rejected efforts to\nexplain moral motivation by appealing to a motivating power emanating\nfrom moral properties and the acts and states of affairs that\ninstantiate them. One partial exception to this last claim may be\nworth noting. Christine Korsgaard (1996) has endorsed the idea of\nsomething like objectively prescriptive entities, though these\nentities are not, in her view, moral properties. Korsgaard shares\nMackie\u2019s skepticism about objective values of the sort he\ndescribes as figuring in the moral realist views of philosophers like\nPlato. Nevertheless, she observes, Mackie is wrong and the realist is\nright with respect to whether any extant entities can meet the dual\ncriteria of providing the agent who knows of them with \u201cboth a\ndirection and a motive.\u201d It is, she insists, \u201cthe most\nfamiliar fact of human life that the world contains entities that can\ntell us what to do and make us do it. They are people, and the others\nanimals\u201d (Korsgaard 1996, 166). Most philosophers, even those\nsympathetic to Kant\u2019s moral philosophy and to Korsgaard\u2019s\nbrand of Kantianism, find the idea that people (and non-human animals)\nhave value and can in that regard \u201ctell us what to do\u201d and\n\u201cmake us do it\u201d rather elusive. But Korsgaard\u2019s\nclaims are part of a large, extremely rich picture of ethics that\ncannot be explored here, and a fair assessment of her claims would\nrequire attention to this larger picture. The important point, for\npresent purposes, is that at least some philosophers, Korsgaard, and\nperhaps others drawn to ideas deriving from Kant\u2019s moral\nphilosophy, retain some attraction to the idea that moral motivation\nand normativity find their source in inherently normative or\n\u201cobjectively prescriptive\u201d entities.\n\nWhether or not there are any properties or entities with anything like\nthe powers Mackie describes, it is a mistake to suppose that moral\nrealists and objectivists must be committed to their existence. No\nrealist or objectivist need think that moral properties, or facts\nabout their instantiation, will, when apprehended, be sufficient to\nmotivate all persons regardless of their circumstances, including\ntheir cognitive and motivational makeup. And realists certainly need\nnot take the view that Mackie ascribes to Plato, that seeing objective\nvalues will ensure that one acts, \u201coverruling any contrary\ninclination\u201d (Mackie 1977,23). An individual might grasp a moral\nfact, for example, but suffer from temporary irrationality or weakness\nof will; she might be free of such temporary defects but possess a\nmore indelible motivational makeup that impedes or defeats the\nmotivating power of moral facts. Any plausible account of moral\nmotivation will, and must, acknowledge these sources of motivational\nfailure; and any plausible analysis of moral properties must allow for\nthem. Even those realists or objectivists who maintain that all\nrational and motivationally unimpaired persons will\nbe moved by moral facts need not think they will be\noverridingly indefeasibly motivated. As already noted,\nregardless of their views with respect to broader metaethical\nquestions, contemporary philosophers do not take any position on the\nprecise strength of moral motivation\u2014with the qualification\n(alluded to earlier) that they reject, apparently universally, the\nidea that moral motivation is ordinarily overriding.\n3. Moral Judgment and Motivation\n\nPhilosophers have most often attempted to explain moral motivation not\nby appealing to the special powers of moral properties but by\nappealing to the nature of moral judgments. Perhaps moral\njudgments are such that no person could sincerely judge an act morally\nright or a state of affairs good, while remaining wholly\nunmoved. Efforts to understand moral motivation in terms of motivation\nby moral judgments must confront two central questions. First, what is\nthe nature of the connection between moral judgment and\nmotivation\u2014do moral judgments motivate necessarily or\ndo they motivate only contingently? Second, can moral\njudgments motivate on their own or can they motivate only by the\nintermediation of a desire or other conative state? Of course,\nphilosophers have answered these questions in varying ways.\n3.1 Humeanism v. Anti-Humeanism\n\nLet\u2019s consider the second question first. Now one way in which\nmoral judgments could motivate, and, indeed, motivate on their own,\nwould be if moral judgments were not representational after all.\nSuppose moral judgments did not ascribe properties and express moral\nbeliefs about what things have those properties. Suppose instead, as\nmoral noncognitivism maintains, that moral judgments express\ndesires or other conative states\u2014what philosophers\nsometimes call \u201cpro-attitudes.\u201d Then it would be clear how\nmoral judgments connect to motivation. They simply express a\nmotivating state that the individual already has; to make a (sincere)\nmoral judgment is already to be motivated, at least to some degree.\nThe real puzzle as to how moral judgments can motivate arises for\nthose who maintain that moral judgments express moral\nbeliefs, for the connection between belief, a cognitive\nstate, and motivation is uncertain.\n\nHow philosophers resolve the puzzle turns on a central issue in moral\npsychology, namely, whether what is called the Humean theory\nof motivation is true. According to the Humean view, belief is\ninsufficient for motivation, which always requires, in addition to\nbelief, the presence of a desire or conative state. Moral motivation\nthus cannot arise from moral belief alone but must depend as well upon\na preexisting desire or other conative or intrinsically motivating\nstate. It would perhaps be fair to say that Humeanism continues to be\nthe dominant view. It has been held both by some who accept and by\nsome who reject cognitivism and moral realism, so it has not alone\nbeen considered decisive in settling broader issues in metaethics. The\nview has been held by noncognitivist anti-realists, for example, but\nalso by moral realists like Michael Smith (1994) and Peter Railton\n(1986a). A number of prominent philosophers, including Thomas Nagel\n(1970), John McDowell (1979), Mark Platts (1980), David McNaughton\n(1988), Jonathan Dancy (1993), Thomas Scanlon (1998), and Russ\nShafer-Landau (2003), have rejected the Humean picture, however,\narguing that, in fact, moral motivation does not depend on the\nexistence of desire: moral belief can itself give rise to\nmotivation.\n\nPrecisely how and under what conditions moral belief can itself\nmotivate is a matter of dispute among anti-Humeans. Some hold that\nmoral belief is sufficient to motivate directly. Merely believing that\nit is right, say, to keep a promise will move the believer, at least\nto some degree, to act so as to keep the promise. Others hold that\nmoral beliefs produce desires, which then motivate in conjunction with\nthe moral beliefs that produced them. Believing that it is right to\nkeep a promise produces a desire to do so, and these cognitive and\nconative states jointly move the believer, at least to some degree, to\nact so as to keep the promise. Certain virtue theorists offer a quite\nrefined version of the latter idea, arguing that only a particular\ntype of moral belief\u2014one tied to an ideal or complete conception\nof a situation in light of a more expansive understanding of how to\nlive\u2014necessarily generates in an individual the motivation to do\nas a moral belief of that type indicates she ought (Little 1997;\nMcDowell 1978). The virtuous person has not mere moral beliefs but a\ncomplex of moral belief and outlook which will reliably move her to\nbehave morally. Proponents of various anti-Humean views readily\nacknowledge that persons often fail to be moved and to act as they\nbelieve they ought. According to any of these views, however, a\nfailure of motivation springs from a cognitive failure.\n\nAs already noted, many have found the basic Humean picture most\nplausible. Before examining a few of the considerations thought to\nfavor it, we should make note of the fact that Humeanism does not\nitself commit one to any particular view as to the sorts of desires\nresponsible for moral motivation. A Humean might well take the view\nthat no particular desire is implicated in moral motivation. On the\ncontrary, varying desires may, when contingently present, move an\nindividual to do what she judges she ought to do, including the desire\nto be well regarded by her neighbors, to advance her interests in some\nway, or to promote the welfare of those who matter to her. Appealing\nsimply to some contingent desire or other may be inadequate, however,\nto explain the basic phenomenon of moral motivation. After all, what\nneeds to be explained, many would argue, is not merely how we may, on\noccasion or even frequently, be motivated to do as we think we ought:\nwhat needs to be explained is how we are reliably motivated\nto do as we think we ought. That includes explaining why motivation\nreliably shifts so as to track changes in our moral beliefs.\nAs we will see, those who accept the Humean picture have sometimes\nsuggested that we look to quite particular desires or to deep features\nof human psychology to explain moral motivation.\n\nOne argument in favor of the Humean picture alleges that if beliefs\nwere sufficient to motivate, then we would expect people with the same\nbeliefs to be motivated in the same way. In fact, however, whereas\nsome people are motivated by their moral belief, say, that\ncontributing to famine relief is a duty, to write a check to Oxfam,\nothers feel no such inclination whatsoever. But anti-Humeans claim\nthat they can explain away these differences by showing either that\ndifferential motivation is in fact due to other differences in belief\nor to motives that compete with and override the desires generated by\nmoral beliefs (Shafer-Landau 2003, 129\u2013130). \n\nA second argument in favor of Humeanism appeals to the view about\nreasons associated with Williams (1981), briefly discussed earlier.\nRecall that according to internalism about reasons or reasons\ninternalism, it is necessarily the case that if an individual has a\nreason to do an action, then he must be able to be motivated to do\nthat action. On a more specific version of the view, an individual has\na reason to do an action only if he has a desire to perform that\naction or to achieve some end that requires doing that action. If\ninternalism about reasons is correct, then when an individual\ncorrectly judges himself to have a reason to perform an action, he\nmust already have a preexisting desire. Anti-Humeans sometimes reject\nreasons internalism, as well as the Humean theory of motivation. But\neven allowing that reasons internalism is correct, they believe this\nsecond argument fails to undermine their position. For it seems\npossible that not all of our moral judgments involve the judgment\n(correct or otherwise) that we have a reason for action. An individual\ncould, for example, judge that it would be right to fulfill a promise\nwithout judging that she has a reason to do anything. What might\nexplain this? Perhaps, for instance, she fails to reflect on the\nconnection between what it is right to do and what one has reason to\ndo; or perhaps she mistakenly believes that truths about morally right\naction do not entail truths about what one has reason to do. If an\nindividual can judge an action right without judging that she has a\nreason to perform the action, then even if an action\u2019s being\nright entails a reason for action and reasons entail desires, moral\nbeliefs need not involve preexisting desires (Shafer-Landau 2003,\n 128\u2013129).[4]\n\nPerhaps the most sophisticated argument in favor of the Humean theory\nof motivation appeals to considerations in the philosophy of mind and\nmoral psychology, specifically, to fundamental differences between\nbelief and desire that would seem to count against\n anti-Humeanism.[5]\n Belief and desire, as a conceptual matter, it is argued, differ in\nwhat has been called their \u201cdirection of fit\u201d (Anscombe\n1963). They differ in such a way, it would seem, that belief states\ncannot entail desire states. Whereas beliefs aim to fit the world,\ndesires aim to change the world. That is to say, whereas beliefs have\na \u201cmind-to-world\u201d direction of fit, desires have a\n\u201cworld-to-mind\u201d direction of fit. For a mental state to\ncount as a belief, it must be at least somewhat responsive to evidence\nthat bears on the truth or falsity of its propositional content; that\nthe facts are contrary to a belief counts against it. In contrast,\nfacts contrary to the propositional content of a desire\u2014the fact\nthat the world is not currently as one wants\u2014need not count\nagainst that desire. Precisely because desires aim not to answer to\nthe world but to make the world answer to them (to make the world fit\ntheir propositional contents or what the desires are desires for),\nthey may well persist even when the world refuses to cooperate.\nAssuming the foregoing claims about belief and desire are true, so the\nargument goes, at least some versions of anti-Humeanism would require\nwhat is incoherent, namely, mental states with incompatible directions\nof fit: mental states that could be at once representational in the\nway that beliefs are and motivational in the way that desires are. But\nanti-Humeans would argue that their picture of moral motivation via\nmoral belief need involve no incoherence. To see this, we need merely\nconsider the possibility that a mental state could have\nopposing directions of fit so long as in exhibiting each direction of\nfit, the mental state was directed at different propositions: the\nvirtuous agent \u201cbelieves\u201d (belief direction of fit), say,\nthat a state of affairs S ought to be promoted and\n\u201cdesires\u201d (desire direction of fit) that S be brought\nabout (Little 1997,\n 64).[6]\n\nAnti-Humeans have offered various considerations\u2014some positive,\nothers negative\u2014to support their rejection of Humeanism. On the\nnegative side, they attempt to defeat considerations thought to favor\nthe Humean theory, as we have already seen in the course of exploring\nsome of those considerations. On the positive side, Anti-Humeans\nsometimes appeal to the phenomenology of moral motivation, arguing\nthat it supports their view. Ask the agent who is sorely tempted to do\notherwise why he ultimately acted as he believed morality required and\nhe will not report his desires at the moment of action; rather, he\nwill explain that he believed the action was the right thing to\ndo (Shafer-Landau 2003, 123). Our own experience and that of\nothers tells us that although our actions often arise from our\ndesires, sometimes they arise instead from our evaluative beliefs. As\nfurther support for these claims about the phenomenology of moral\nmotivation, Shafer-Landau has appealed to nonmoral cases in which\nmotivation seems to follow from belief. Consider the individual who\nconvinces herself that she has a desire she in fact lacks, such as the\ndesire to become a lawyer. She enrolls in law school only to find\nherself unmotivated by her coursework and dropping out of school,\nafter a summer spent working as a carpenter reveals her love of\ncarpentry (Shafer-Landau 2003, 125). What most plausibly explains the\nindividual\u2019s enrollment in law school and her half-hearted\nefforts during that first year would seem to be her mistaken belief\nthat she desired to become a lawyer. Given that many of our choices\nwill involve subjecting ourselves to tedious, even painful,\nexperiences\u2014experiences that surely none of us desire for their\nown sake\u2014the Humean owes us some explanation of our willingness\nto persist in such choices. The Humean will, it seems, be forced to\nappeal to some further desire we thereby seek to satisfy, such as, in\nthe case of the law school drop-out, the desire to become a lawyer.\nBut such an explanation will be implausible in cases in which we are\nmistaken about our desires. No compelling reason can be given to\naccept a desire-based explanation of our actions, Shafer-Landau\nargues, over the more straightforward explanation in terms of our\nbeliefs.\n\nYet Humeans would insist that there is nothing straightforward about\nattempts to explain moral motivation and action in terms of beliefs;\njust recall the argument for Humeanism based on differences in\n\u201cdirection of fit\u201d between belief and desire. Leaving that\nargument to one side, however, neither the phenomenology of moral\nmotivation nor cases in which individuals are mistaken about their\ndesires support the anti-Humean view. The fact that an individual may\ncite a belief rather than a desire in explaining why she did what she\njudged to be right does nothing to show either that her moral belief\ndirectly moved her to act or that it generated a desire that moved her\nto act. Individual self-reports are notoriously unreliable and can\nhardly settle so fundamental a question about moral psychology. As for\ncases in which individuals are (allegedly) mistaken about their\ndesires, common sense suggests that the Humean has the more\nstraightforward explanation. The Humean might argue that the law\nschool drop-out in fact did desire to become a lawyer, or at least to\nenroll in law school; she simply didn\u2019t understand what studying\nlaw would be like. Once she experienced it, she lost her desire to\ncontinue her studies. Alternatively, perhaps she really didn\u2019t\ndesire to become a lawyer, though she told herself that she did.\nStill, she was moved to enter law school not by her bare belief, but\nby a more deep seated, perhaps not fully conscious desire, such as the\ndesire to please her parents or to have the prestige or pay that comes\nwith being a lawyer. Anti-Humeans have given us no reason to favor\ntheir explanation over the Humean alternatives. Of course,\nanti-Humeans need not think the phenomenology, as they suppose it to\nbe, settles the dispute, but Humeans will insist that it does not even\ntend to favor the anti-Humean position.\n\nThe foregoing discussion does not, of course, cover every argument\nthat has been offered in the longstanding debate between Humeans and\nanti-Humeans, just a few of the ones that philosophers have evidently\nfound most persuasive. Whether and how the debate might be resolved\nremains uncertain, in part, because the nature of the dispute is\nrather unclear. Is it at bottom a conceptual dispute to be resolved,\nfor instance, by analysis of the concepts of belief and desire?\nPerhaps, though arguments that appeal to considerations in the\nphilosophy of mind and moral psychology have thus far proved less than\nfully convincing. Is the dispute instead fundamentally empirical? The\ntendency to appeal to common sense and the phenomenology of moral\naction would seem to betray some temptation to treat the issue as at\nleast partly empirical, though perhaps these appeals are meant to\nserve merely as a check on conceptual claims. Appeals to our\nexperience can, in any case, be just as well, and just as\ninconclusively, invoked by those on either side of the debate. In the\ncontext of warding off criticisms of the view that virtue is\nknowledge, Little (1997) suggests that the dispute is fundamentally\ntheoretical, implicating large and complex questions about the nature\nof agency, normativity, and responsibility. Whether or not that is so,\nLittle may be right in suggesting that the dispute will not be\nresolvable by appeal to merely local arguments of the sort we have\nconsidered. How plausible one finds either side may turn, in the end,\non the plausibility of the larger theories in which these views\nrespectively figure.\n3.2 Internalism v. Externalism\n\nWhatever one might conclude as to whether moral judgments or beliefs\nmotivate on their own or only by means of some preexisting conative\nstate, a question remains as to the precise nature of the connection\nbetween moral judgment and motivation. Do moral judgments motivate\nnecessarily or do they motivate only contingently?\nIf the latter, then how are we to explain why the contingent\nconnection between moral judgment and motivation is as strong and\nreliable as it appears to be?\n\nThe main division of opinion regarding the nature of the connection\nbetween moral judgment and motivation is between those philosophers\nwho accept and those who reject a thesis known as motivational\njudgment internalism. This thesis is a form of judgment\ninternalism. Traditionally, judgment internalism has been\ncharacterized as claiming either that motivation is internal to moral\njudgment, in the sense that moral judgment itself motivates without\nneed of an accompanying desire (\u201cstrong internalism\u201d) or\nthat there is a necessary connection between moral judgment and\nmotivation (\u201cweak internalism\u201d). As currently\ncharacterized in the literature, judgment internalism makes the\nconceptual claim that a necessary connection exists between sincere\nmoral judgment and either justifying reasons or motives: necessarily,\nif an individual sincerely judges that she ought to \u03c6, then she\nhas a reason or motive to \u03c6. Judgment internalism must be\ndistinguished from the thesis of existence internalism, which we\nconsidered earlier. Recall that according to existence\ninternalism, a necessary connection exists between having a certain\nnormative status and\n motivation.[7]\n A consideration can be a reason or be right-making,\nfor example, only if it is capable of motivating. Whereas judgment\ninternalism states a necessary condition on being a judgment of a\ncertain kind, existence internalism states a necessary condition on\nbeing an act or state or consideration of a certain normative\nkind.\n\nMotivational judgment internalism, hereafter\n\u201cinternalism,\u201d holds that a person cannot sincerely make a\nmoral judgment without being motivated at least to some\ndegree to abide by her judgment. Internalism can assume weaker or\nstronger forms. On Mackie\u2019s account of Plato, is it the view\nthat necessarily a person who makes a sincere moral judgment will be\noverridingly motivated to comply with her judgment. Thus,\nwhat objective moral properties must be like involves a rather extreme\nform of existence internalism, which would be allied with a rather\nextreme form of judgment internalism. Contemporary moral philosophers\nhave been no more attracted to so strong a claim when moral motivation\nis tied to moral judgment than they have been when moral motivation is\ntied to moral properties. Instead, they have accepted weaker forms of\ninternalism, which allow that even though, necessarily, the person who\nmakes a sincere moral judgment will feel some motivation to\ncomply with it, that motivation can be overridden by conflicting\ndesires and defeated by a variety of mental maladies, such as\ndepression and weakness of will (Svavarsdottir 1999, sec.1). \n\nAs should already be evident, those who accept one or another form of\nmotivational judgment internalism have a ready explanation of the\nreliability of moral motivation, including the reliability of\nmotivational shifting so as to track changes in moral judgment.\nIndeed, one argument offered in favor of internalism is that only if\nwe accept it can we plausibly explain why changes in moral motivation\nreliably follow upon changes in moral judgment (Smith 1994,\n71\u201376). Suppose Jones and Thomson are debating the moral\npermissibility of abortion. Jones is inclined to believe that abortion\nis morally wrong. She has been known to join the protest line outside\nof a local abortion clinic and to try to dissuade women from having\nabortions. Thomson, in contrast, believes that abortion is morally\npermissible. Suppose that after extensive discussion, Thomson\nconvinces Jones that the more plausible arguments support the\npermissibility of abortion. What would people reasonably predict in\nterms of Jones\u2019s future conduct? They would reasonably predict,\namong other things, that she would no longer be inclined to join the\nprotest line and that she would desist from her efforts to discourage\nother women from having abortions. But that prediction rests precisely\non the expectation that, at least insofar as Jones is a good and\nstrong-willed person\u2014not depressed or apathetic or suffering\nfrom weakness of will\u2014what she is motivated to do will have been\naltered in response to the change in her moral judgment, which is just\nwhat internalism would lead us to expect. If internalism is true,\nthen, we can readily account for motivational changes. The reliable\nconnection between moral judgment and motivation is, ultimately, best\nexplained internally as due to the very content or nature of moral\njudgment itself (Smith 1994, 72). Those who accept internalism will,\nof course, ultimately owe us an account of the nature of moral\njudgments that explains and captures the necessary connection that\nsupposedly exists between moral judgment and\n motivation.[8]\n\nThe thesis that directly opposes motivational judgment internalism,\nmotivational externalism, or just externalism,\ndenies that it is a conceptual platitude that necessarily moral\njudgments motivate. According to externalism, any connection that\nexists between moral judgment and motivation is purely contingent,\nthough it may turn out to rest on deep features of human\n nature.[9]\n Moral motivation occurs when a moral judgment combines with a desire,\nand the content of the judgment is related to the content of the\ndesire so as to rationalize the action. The foregoing argument in\nfavor of internalism in effect denies that externalism can adequately\nexplain the basic phenomenon of moral motivation and, in particular,\nthe seemingly reliable shifting of moral motivation to match changes\nin moral judgment. But why think externalism will be explanatorily\ninadequate? Once we have the internalist thesis about the necessary\nconnection between moral judgment and motivation, it seems we have, as\nit were, the whole story: if an individual makes a moral judgment, she\nis, ceteris paribus, motivated; if she is not motivated, she\nwas not making a sincere and competent moral judgment at all,\nappearances to the contrary notwithstanding. Because the externalist\ndenies the existence of a necessary connection between moral judgment\nand motivation, the externalist thesis leaves us in need of an\nindependent explanation of moral motivation. The internalist maintains\nthat any such explanation will fall short\u2014call this the\n\u201cinternist challenge\u201d to externalism.\n\nAccording to one important version of the internalist challenge,\noffered by Michael Smith, the externalist would have to explain the\nconnection between moral judgment and motivation externally\nas due not to the content of moral judgments but, rather, the\n\u201ccontent of the motivational dispositions possessed by the good\nand strong-willed person\u201d (Smith 1994, 72). But this allegedly\ncommits the externalist to an unacceptable picture of moral\nmotivation. The internalist will say that an agent who is moved to do\nthe right thing is moved to do the very thing that is given by the\ncontent of her moral judgment; she is motivated to do the very thing\nshe judges to be right (73). The person who judges it right to perform\nan act that advances another\u2019s welfare, for example, acquires\nand is moved by a non-derivative desire or concern to advance his\nwelfare. In contrast, the externalist must say that an agent is moved\nto do what she judges right due to the content of the motivational\ndispositions that she has in being a good person. The question then is\nwhat those dispositions might be. Recall that when a person\u2019s\njudgment changes, her motivation tends to change. If such motivational\nshifting is to be explained in terms of the motivational dispositions\nof the good person, rather than in terms of the content of her moral\njudgments, then the only disposition that could do the explaining\nwould be the motivation to do the right thing, whatever it\nhappens to be (75). According to Smith, such a view implausibly treats\nmoral motivation as derivative; it derives from the desire to do the\nright thing together with a person\u2019s current moral judgment\nabout the right thing to do. A person desires to promote\nanother\u2019s good, not non-derivatively because she judges\nit right to promote his good and so desires to do just that, but\nbecause she desires to do what is right, and that just happens to be\npromoting his good. But the good person, Smith claims, cares\nnon-derivatively about justice, equality, and the welfare of\nloved ones. To care non-derivatively only about doing what one\nbelieves right, to be motivated in that way, and not by these other\nthings, is \u201ca fetish or moral vice\u201d (75). Smith suggests\nthat in taking the good person to be motivated to do what she believes\nmorally right, whatever that might be, the externalist picture\n\u201calienates her from the ends at which morality properly\naims\u201d (76).\n\nExternalists have responded to this challenge by pointing out that the\nfact that a good person is motivated to do what she thinks right does\nnot preclude her from also being motivated non-derivately by direct\nconcern, for example, for the welfare of loved ones. They have also\nargued that there is nothing fetishistic in supposing that the good\nperson is motivationally disposed to do the right thing and that, in\nany case, alternative externalist explanations of a reliable\nconnection between moral judgment and motivation are available (Copp\n1997, 49\u201350). An individual could, for example, simply be\ndisposed to desire immediately to do whatever she believes it right to\ndo or whatever she judges to be valuable, rather than being disposed\nto do the right thing, whatever it turns out to be (Copp 1997,\n50\u201351). Sigrun Svavarsdottir (1999) has argued that Smith is\nmistaken when he claims that the externalist\u2019s only option for\nexplaining motivational shifting is to appeal to a desire to do the\nright thing, but she thinks that something close to the view Smith\nrejects provides just the right externalist picture of moral\nmotivation. We should, on her view, understand the good person as\nconcerned with doing what is morally valuable or required, where that\nconcern should be understood to encompass what is honest, fair, kind,\nconsiderate, just, and so on. The fact that the good person is so\nmotivationally disposed does not mean, as Smith seems to suggest, that\nshe cares only about one thing, namely, doing what she believes is\nright. Nor does it mean that she undertakes an act conceiving of it\nsimply as the right thing to do. On the contrary, it is compatible\nwith the externalist picture that the good person will often simply\nrespond directly to another\u2019s need for comfort or relief.\nMoreover, an externalist view that conceives of the good person as\nmotivated by the desire to be moral does not involve introducing an\nalien (or alienating) thought\u2014\u201cit\u2019s the right thing\nto do\u201d\u2014 into her consciousness in order to explain moral\nmotivation. Rather, having formed the moral judgment that she ought to\n\u03c6, the desire to be moral plays, in the good person, a role in\neffecting the \u201cpsychological transition\u201d from judging it\nright to \u03c6 to wanting to \u03c6 (Svavarsdottir 1999, 201). Finally,\nSvavarsdottir argues that although a desire to do the morally right\naction, say, aid another in need, may derive at first from a desire to\nbe moral, it may come to operate independently of the latter desire,\nso that her desire to aid is not simply an instrumental desire\n(Svavarsdottir 1999, 205\u2013206, 213\u2013214).\n\nIndeed, the point on which externalists want to insist is that some\nconative state must be at work in the movement from judging it right\nto \u03c6 to wanting or being moved to \u03c6. After all, the\nexternalist will remind us, this movement does not occur in\nall moral agents; some of them will judge it right to \u03c6\nwithout being moved to \u03c6. Externalists typically take it as a\npoint of common sense observation that wide variation exists in the\nimpact moral judgments have on people\u2019s feelings, deliberations,\nand actions (Svavarsdottir 1999, 161).\n\nDebates between internalists and externalists often center on the\nfigure of the \u201camoralist\u201d\u2014the person who apparently\nmakes moral judgments, while remaining wholly unmoved to comply with\nthem. Various efforts have been made to respond to the problem of the\namoralist, and these efforts have led to the development of numerous\nversions of motivational judgment internalism. Generally, internalists\nhave insisted that the amoralist is a conceptual impossibility. The\nstandard strategy internalists employ to cope with the hypothetical\namoralist is to identify a content for moral judgments which would\nhave the result that no agent (or no rational agent, anyway)\ncould employ moral concepts competently and make a sincere moral\njudgment, while remaining unmoved. Internalists allow that moral\nmotivation need not be overriding; competing desires may be stronger\nand so may win out. They allow, too, that moral motivation is\ndefeasible; a person may judge it right to \u03c6, while failing to be\nmoved to \u03c6, due to depression or weakness of will. Cases of\nirrationality aside, however, the person who appears to be\nmaking a moral judgment, while remaining unmoved, must really either\nlack competence with moral concepts or be speaking insincerely. In the\nlatter case, she judges an act \u201cright\u201d only in an\n\u201cinverted commas\u201d sense (R. M Hare, 1963), as when the\nunrepentant criminal, seeking a lesser sentence, tells the judge, in a\nremorseful tone, that he knows what he did was\n\u201cwrong\u201d.\n\nExternalists, of course, maintain that the amoralist is not a\nconceptual impossibility. After all, if we can conceive of\namoralists, as we surely can, then they are not conceptually\nimpossible (Shafer-Landau 2003, 146). Contrary to what internalists\nclaim, individuals can sincerely and competently apply moral concepts\nwithout being motivated in any specific way. While some amoralists may\nuse moral terms only in an inverted commas sense, not all cases of\nmotivational failure can be explained away as cases of irrationality,\nconceptual incompetence, or insincerity.\n\nAt this point in the dialectic, internalists and externalists tend to\nproduce additional arguments in an effort to overcome what seems an\nimpasse. Externalists, for example, may invite us to consider cases in\nwhich a person judges it right to \u03c6, while believing it would in\nfact be impossible to succeed in doing \u03c6, or cases in which she\nthinks doing \u03c6 would markedly interfere with her welfare or would\nprevent her from obtaining something she dearly desires. Doesn\u2019t\nit seem plausible that in such cases a person could judge it right to\n\u03c6, while failing to be moved to \u03c6? More generally,\nexternalists argue that internalists cannot make sense of\nmorality\u2019s historical challenger\u2014the skeptic who asks,\n\u201cWhy be moral?\u201d Externalists may also offer arguments\naimed at shifting the burden on to the internalist to establish that\ninternalism is a conceptual platitude (Svavarsdottir 1999, 2006).\n\nIn order more fully to address the variety of cases in which the\nconnection between moral judgment and motivation fails, internalists\nhave offered more qualified versions of internalism. These more\nqualified versions of internalism maintain that the necessary\nconnection between moral judgment and motivation holds only under\ncertain conditions. As for what these conditions are, a variety of\nviews have been advanced. For example, Smith (1994) has advanced a\nversion of internalism, or what he calls the \u201cpracticality\nrequirement,\u201d maintaining that a necessary connection holds\nbetween moral judgment and motivation, at least in the \u201cgood and\nstrong-willed person.\u201d The connection between moral judgment and\nmotivation holds, he claims, in the person who is \u201cpractically\nrational.\u201d Others have suggested that it holds in the person who\nis \u201cpsychologically normal\u201d (Dreier 1990) or in the person\nwho is \u201cmorally perceptive\u201d (Bjorklund et al. 2012:\n126-128).\n\nBut problems remain. What about the person who made a certain moral\njudgment in the past and had always been moved to act in accordance\nwith that judgment but who ceases to be motivated, while continuing to\nmake the judgment? Perhaps she judges that she morally ought to work\nactively to aid the sick and poor. After 20 years of doing so, she\nconcludes that she has done enough and ceases to be motivated to act\non her judgment, yet she continues to judge that she morally ought to\nwork actively to aid the sick and poor. Doesn\u2019t it seem\nplausible that she is competent with the moral concepts, that she\nspeaks sincerely, that she uses moral terms in their ordinary sense,\nrather than an \u201cinverted commas\u201d sense? Yet she need not\nbe apathetic or depressed or otherwise mentally ill.\n\nCases like these have led some to move away from the idea that the\nnecessary connection between moral judgment and motivation holds with\nrespect to each individual moral judgment. Those who advance forms of\nwhat Bjorklund et al. (2012) (see also Bjornsson et al. 2015) call\n\u201cdeferred internalism\u201d hold that the necessary connection\nbetween moral judgment and motivation can be more attenuated.\n\nDeferred internalism:\n\nNecessarily if a person judges that she morally ought to \u03c6, then\nshe is either (at least somewhat) motivated to \u03c6 or some\nrelevantly connected moral judgments are accompanied by motivation.\n(Bjorklund et al. 2012: 128)\n\n\nSo, in the example above, our aid worker who has ceased to be\nmotivated but still judges that she morally ought to \u03c6 had some\nrelevantly connected moral judgments that were accompanied by\nmotivation, namely, her own past judgments. Others maintain that the\namoralist is only intelligible relative to conditions in which moral\nmotivation ordinarily holds, and this has led some to find the\nrelevantly connected moral judgments in an agent\u2019s community.\nTresan (2009a and 2009b), for example, considers the possibility of a\n\u201ccommunal\u201d version of deferred internalism, which counts\nan individual\u2019s beliefs as moral only when, in the\nbeliever\u2019s community, beliefs with that content are motivating.\n(And see Blackburn 2001, 63.)\n\nAs versions of internalism become increasingly qualified, one might be\ninclined to wonder whether there is much distinction any longer\nbetween internalism and externalism. One might be inclined to wonder\nwhether either has the edge in explaining the reliability of moral\nmotivation. And if that is the case, one might be attracted to what\nseems to be the simpler story the externalist has to tell about the\nconnection between moral judgment and motivation.\n\nExternalists maintain that they can fully and adequately account for\nthe strong but ultimately contingent connection between moral judgment\nand motivation, offering various explanations of how moral judgments\nreliably motivate. As we have seen, Svavarsdottir seeks to explain\nmoral motivation by appealing to a particular conative state, namely,\nthe desire to do what is morally valuable or required\u2014the\ndesire, in short to be moral. Peter Railton appeals to the concern\npeople generally have to be able to justify their choices and conduct\nfrom a more impartial standpoint. But he also apparently thinks that\npeople\u2019s more ordinary motives play a part; at least this is\nsuggested when he remarks that, if we really want people to take\nmorality seriously, \u201cwe should ask how we might change the ways\nwe live so that moral conduct would more regularly be rational given\nthe ends we actually have\u201d (Railton 1986a, 203). According to\nDavid Brink, externalism makes the motivational force of our moral\njudgments \u201ca matter of contingent psychological fact, depending\non both the content of people\u2019s moral views and their attitudes\nand desires\u201d (Brink 1989, 49). Still, these attitudes and\ndesires may be widely shared and rooted in central features of human\nnature. Suppose, as the philosopher David Hume maintained, that\nsympathy is a deep and widely shared feature of human psychology.\nThen, Brink observes, while it may be a contingent fact that most\npeople will have some desire to comply with what they believe morality\nrequires, it will also be a deep fact about them. \u201cMoral\nmotivation, on such a view, can be widespread and predictable, even if\nit is neither necessary, nor universal, nor overriding\u201d (Brink\n1989, 49; Boyd 1998, sec. 4.7).\n\nPhilosophers who endorse externalism commonly also endorse Humeanism,\nthough it is important to remember that many internalists, including\nmost noncognitivists and expressivists about moral judgment, also\naccept the Humean theory of motivation. Indeed, some contend that the\nbasic observation that supports externalism also lends support to the\nHumean theory: wide variation in the motivational impact of moral\njudgments suggests not only that they motivate contingently but that\nthey do so via some conative state. Still, externalists need not be\nHumeans. Shafer-Landau, who rejects both Humeanism and internalism,\nholds that moral beliefs are indeed intrinsically\nmotivating\u2014they can motivate by themselves. But contra\ninternalism, they are not necessarily motivating. Intrinsically\nmotivating beliefs may fail to motivate under conditions of extreme\nexhaustion, serious depression, or overwhelming contrary impulses\n(Shafer-Landau 2003, 147\u2013148). The fact that Shafer-Landau\ntreats the defeasibility of moral motivation under such conditions as\nsupporting a form of externalism, whereas Smith treats defeasibility\nunder like conditions as compatible with a form of internalism,\nsuggests some disagreement among philosophers as to precisely when a\nview should be classified as a form of internalism or\n externalism.[10]\n4. Moral Motivation and Metaethics\n\nPhilosophical thinking about the phenomenon of moral motivation has\nlong overlapped with and influenced ongoing efforts to address\nfoundational questions in ethics. Of special importance has been the\nuse of ideas concerning the nature of moral motivation to support\nanti-realism in ethics\u2014the view that contrary to the\nclaims of moral realists, there are no moral facts, no truths about\nwhat morality requires, forbids, or permits, except, perhaps, in some\nminimalist sense. We have already seen one example of how ideas about\nmoral motivation might bear on broader metaethical views in\nMackie\u2019s critique of ethical objectivism. As noted earlier,\nMackie defends cognitivist anti-realism, a form of\nanti-realism that couples cognitivism with an error theory. According\nto cognitivist anti-realism, although ethical sentences express\npropositions about objectively prescriptive properties\u2014ones with\n\u201cto-be-pursuedness\u201d built in\u2014no such properties\nexist; and due to this presupposition failure, we are systematically\nin error in our moral judgments.\n\nThe development of metaethical theories over roughly the past eighty\nsome years has perhaps been shaped most profoundly by the use of\ncertain theses about moral motivation to support noncognitivist\nanti-realism. Noncognitivist anti-realism, like\ncognitivist anti-realism, rejects the existence of robust moral\nproperties and moral facts. But unlike the latter view, it rejects\ncognitivism in favor of noncognitivism, which as\ntraditionally depicted is the view that moral judgments express\nattitudes rather than beliefs or propositions, and that, consequently,\nthey are not truth\n evaluable.[11]\n\nShafer-Landau (2003) offers a formulation of what he calls the\nNon-cognitivist Argument, which helpfully makes explicit how\ntheses that have figured in efforts to understand moral motivation\nhave been employed to support noncognitivist anti-realism:\n\nNecessarily, if one sincerely judges an action right, then one is\nmotivated to some extent to act in accordance with that judgment.\n(Motivational Judgment Internalism)\nWhen taken by themselves, beliefs neither motivate nor generate\nany motivationally efficacious states. (Motivational\nHumeanism)\nTherefore, moral judgments are not beliefs. (Moral\n Non-cognitivism)[12]\n\n\nSince moral realism incorporates the cognitivist claim that moral\njudgments are beliefs, the conclusion of the Non-cognitivist Argument\nentails that moral realism is false.\n\nContemporary philosophers who have sought to defend versions of moral\nrealism or objectivism have had to come to grips with this basic line\nof argument, even if they have not always engaged with it explicitly.\nThe Non-cognitivist Argument therefore provides us with a useful tool\nfor mapping out competing positions in metaethics. We can categorize\nphilosophers\u2019 positions negatively in terms of which premises of\nthe noncognitivist argument they accept or\n reject.[13]\n Some have rejected premise 1, often going on to defend forms of\nnaturalist moral realism that embrace externalism (e.g.\nRailton 1986; Boyd 1988; Brink 1989). According to the latter views,\nmoral properties are a kind of natural property and moral facts are\nnatural facts. Judgments about these facts express propositions, and\nso they can be true or false, but these judgment do not necessarily\nmotivate. Whether our moral judgments motivate us is fixed by\ncontingent facts about our psychologies and our substantive moral\nbeliefs. Some have rejected premise 2 (McDowell 1978, 1979), and some\nof those who have rejected premise 2 have aligned themselves with\nversions of moral constructivism or rationalism (e.g. Darwall 1983;\nScanlon 1998). The latter views take widely varying forms, but they\ngenerally see moral principles as requirements of rationality or\nreason, or as the output of a hypothetical agreement among reasonable,\nsuitably situated persons. Moral reasons are considerations that are\nmotivating, at least when we properly reflect on them, but their\nmotivating force does not depend on a prior desire. Some have rejected\nboth premises 1 and 2, defending forms of nonnaturalist moral\nrealism (Shafer-Landau 2003). Moral properties, on this view, are\nnot identical with natural or descriptive properties, although they\nmay be wholly constituted by them. Moral judgments are intrinsically\nmotivating\u2014they can motivate in the absence of a preexisting\ndesire, but they are not necessarily motivating. Finally, some have\naccepted both premises 1 and 2, at least appropriately refined,\narguing that we can see them both to be compatible with moral\ncognitivism, and further, with moral realism (Smith 1994). For\nexample, Smith understands the subject matter of judgments about right\naction as being normative reasons for action. According to him,\nnormative reasons are given by facts about what we would, suitably\nidealized, want ourselves to desire; and the existence of such facts\nmeans that some desires are rationally required. If we believe\nourselves to have a normative reason to \u03c6, then rationally we\nought to \u03c6, and in judging that we have normative reason to \u03c6,\nwe will necessarily, insofar as we are rational, be moved to \u03c6.\nThe concept of rightness is the concept of what we would, were we\nfully rational, desire ourselves to desire in our actual world. When\nwe believe it would be right to \u03c6, then, we will, insofar as we\nare rational, be motivated to \u03c6.\n\nMore recently, some (e.g. Tresan 2006, 2009a, 2009b) have argued that\nwhen understood as what Bjorklund et al. (2012) call\n\u201cnon-constitutional,\u201d motivational judgment internalism is\ncompatible not only with Smithian rationalism, but with a wide variety\nof cognitivist metaethical theories. \u201cNon-constitutional\ninternalism\u201d (or what Tresan calls \u201cSM internalism\u201d)\nis the view that according to our concept of a moral belief, a mental\nstate counts as a moral belief only if it is accompanied by\nmotivation. Necessarily, if p is a moral belief, then p is accompanied\nby motivation. According to Tresan, once we recognize this form of\ninternalism, we see that it is compatible with almost any version of\ncognitivism, and so with a range of metaethical views, including forms\nof ethical naturalism (2006: 68). This contrasts with attempts to\ncombine internalism and cognitivism on the grounds that the nature of\nmoral belief is such as to guarantee motivation (at least under\ncertain conditions) either because of the content of moral beliefs\n(Smith 1994) or because moral beliefs are themselves intrinsically\nmotivating states (Dancy 1993). (See Bjorklund et al. 2011).\n5. Moral Motivation and Experimental Psychology\n\nWork in experimental psychology may also shape how we understand and\nanswer our questions about moral motivation. A number of philosophers\nhave recently brought work in psychology to bear on questions in\nmetaethics and on the question of moral motivation in particular. Such\nwork has been argued to have implications for the nature of motivation\ngenerally, for the debate between motivational internalists and\nexternalists, and for the plausibility of various philosophical\naccounts of the nature of moral motivation. \n\nSchroeder et al. sketch what they describe as caricatures of four\npossible theories of moral motivation, which they label\ninstrumentalist, cognitivist, sentimentalist, and personalist, and\nargue that \u201ctheories of morally worthy motivation that best fit\nthe current scientific picture are ones that owe much more to Hume or\nAristotle than to Kant\u201d\n (72).[14]\n According to the instrumentalist, \u201cpeople are motivated when\nthey form beliefs about how to satisfy preexisting [intrinsic]\ndesires\u201d (74), which lead in turn to the formation of\nnonintrinsic desires to take specific actions aimed at satisfying\ntheir intrinsic desires. When a person has an intrinsic desire, D, and\ncomes to believe that \u03c6-ing will satisfy D, she comes to desire\n(nonintrinsically) to \u03c6. On the instrumentalist view, commonly\ncalled \u201cHumean,\u201d the specifically moral character of\nmotivation comes from an intrinsic desire to do what one judges to be\nright. In contrast to the instrumentalist, the cognitivist holds that\nmoral motivation begins, not with desires, but with beliefs about\nwhich actions are right. Such beliefs motivate independently of\npreexisting intrinsic desires. Morally worthy action arises not from\ndesires, at least not in the first instance, but from moral judgments\n(76). The sentimentalist sees the emotions as playing a central role\nin moral motivation, and for an action to be the result of moral\nmotivation, certain emotions must cause that action. The right kind of\nemotions are things like compassion or sympathy (77). Finally, the\npersonalist sees the source of moral motivation in morally good\ncharacter, more specifically, in the virtues. \u201cGood character\ninvolves knowledge of the good, wanting what is good for its own sake,\nlong-standing emotional dispositions that favor good action, and\nlong-standing habits of responding to one\u2019s knowledge, desires\nand emotions with good actions\u201d (77). Moral action begins when a\nperson\u2019s sensitivity to moral patterns and moral heuristics\n(such as that lying tends to be bad) leads her to judge that an action\nwould be good, which engages her long-standing emotional dispositions\nand habits, thereby resulting in moral motivation. \n\nAccording to Schroeder et al., each of these views \u201cpresuppose\ncommitments regarding the nature of psychological states such as\nbeliefs, desires, choices, emotions, and so on, together with\ncommitments regarding the functional and causal roles they play\u201d\n(79). Because these commitments are not only philosophical but also\nempirical, they go on to summarize the empirical\nwork\u2014\u201ctextbook neuroscience\u201d\u2014on the\nneurophysiology of motivation and to assess the implications of the\nscience for these four philosophical views about moral motivation.\n\n\nThe instrumentalist view, they argue, fares well given the\nneuroscience, as does the personalist account. In contrast, the\ncognitivist account of moral motivation runs into trouble \u201csince\nour moral behavior does not appear to be under the control of\ncognitive states alone independently of desire\u201d (106). The\nsentimentalist\u2019s view likewise runs into difficulty\n\u201cbecause the emotional system, while closely linked to the\nsystem underlying voluntary action, will turn out to be nonetheless\ndistinct from it unless emotions are themselves built in part from\ndesires\u201d (106). Schroeder et al. acknowledge that our current\nunderstanding of the neuroscience is incomplete and that responses can\nbe offered to the criticisms that they make (106). Nevertheless, they\nsuggest that attention to the neuroscience \u201ccould serve to\nconstrain future theorizing about the structure of moral\nagency\u2026\u201d (107).\n\nRoskies (2003) attempts to draw conclusions about a particular kind of\ninternalism about moral motivation by focusing on empirical evidence\ndrawn from patients with damage to the ventromedial (VM) cortex. More\nprecisely, she argues against the view that moral belief entails moral\nmotivation, a view she calls \u201cmotive-internalism\u201d, which\nis the view called \u201cstrong internalism\u201d in section 3.2 As\nshe describes it, motive-internalism is the view that\n\u201cmotivation is intrinsic to, or a necessary component of moral\nbelief or judgment\u201d (52). The person who sincerely believes that\nshe ought to F is thereby motivated, to some degree, to F. The\nexternalist holds, in contrast, that moral belief does not entail\nmoral motivation; a person can believe that she ought to F, while\nlacking any motivation to F. Roskies explains that the internalist\nclaim involves necessity, intrinsicness, and specificity. According to\nthe motive-internalist, it is a necessary truth that\nmotivation accompanies moral belief or judgment, and so it is true\n\u201cof any agent capable of moral beliefs\u201d (52). The\nintrinsicness of motive-internalism consists in the idea that\nthe connection between moral belief or judgment and motivation holds\nbecause of the content of the moral belief, rather than because of\nsomething unrelated to the content of that belief. As for\nspecificity, motive-internalism sees moral beliefs as\ndifferent from other kinds of beliefs, which are not intrinsically\nmotivating (52). \n\nAccording to Roskies, the \u201cmotive-internalist\u201d faces a\ndilemma: either her internalist thesis is too weak and so is\nphilosophically uninteresting, or it is strong enough to be\nphilosophically interesting but also \u201cdemonstrably false\u201d\n(51). On the first horn of the dilemma, the internalist thesis is too\nweak and so is philosophically uninteresting. Roskies illustrates this\nhorn of the dilemma with Smith\u2019s view that there is a necessary\nconnection between moral judgment and motivation, except when an agent\nfails to be practically rational. This thesis requires a specification\nof what it is to be practically rational, but if being practically\nrational amounts to desiring to act as one judges best, she contends,\nthen the thesis is trivial. It is not a strong claim about a necessary\nconnection between moral judgment and motivation but a mere\ndefinitional claim about practical rationality. What\u2019s more, it\nlacks specificity, because it applies as well to what an agent judges\nto be nonmorally best. Other version of motive-internalism likewise\nrender the thesis trivial (53\u201355).\n\nOn the other horn of the dilemma, the internalist claim is\nphilosophically interesting but false. Here, Roskies argues that\npersons with injury to the VM cortex are a \u201cwalking\ncounterexample\u201d to internalism. As Roskies describes them, such\npatients \u201cappear cognitively normal on a wide spectrum of\nstandard psychological tests, including those measuring intelligence\nand reasoning abilities\u201d, however, they \u201call appear to\nhave particular difficulty in acting in accordance with social mores\ndespite their retained ability to judge appropriately in such\nsituations\u201d (56). The condition of these patients has been\nreferred to as \u201cacquired sociopathy\u201d. According to\nRoskies, VM patients are able to \u201creason morally at a normal\nlevel\u201d and their moral claims \u201caccord with those of\nnormals\u201d, but they fail to reliably act as normal persons do\nand, what\u2019s more, \u201cseem to lack appropriate motivational\nand emotional responses\u201d (57). VM patients do not exhibit the\nskin-conductive response (SCR) to emotionally-charged stimuli that\nnormal persons exhibit, which Roskies take to be evidence of the\nabsence of motivation. VM patients allegedly present a counterexample\nto motive-internalism because they have mastery of moral terms and\nappear to make sincere moral judgments, while lacking any motivation\nto act in accordance with them (59). \n\nVarious arguments have been offered against the alleged results of\nempirical findings for motivational internalism. Some have argued that\nVM patients lack moral concepts (Kennett and Fine 2007), that VM\npatients make moral judgments only in what R. M Hare (1963) called the\n\u201cinverted commas\u201d sense (Kennett and Fine 2007), that VM\npatients are, in fact motivated when they make moral judgments\n(Kennett and Fine 2007), that the evidence offered for the claim that\nVM patients make moral judgments without experiencing emotion\n\u201cis not decisive\u201d (Prinz 2015), that we have reasons to\ndoubt that VM patients have moral beliefs (Cholbi 2006), and that VM\npatients have impaired agency and so do not make genuine moral\njudgments, which require agency (Gerrans and Kennett 2010). In varying\nways, these responses challenge whether it is conceptually coherent to\ntreat cases of VM patients as cases of amoralism. Insofar as the\ndisagreement concerns the conceptual coherence of amoralism, it is\nuncertain how appealing to the empirical literature helps to advance\nthe debate. Of course, Roskies might (following Prinz (2015), see\nbelow) maintain that internalism is in fact a psychological rather\nthan a conceptual thesis, in which case these criticisms of the\nconceptual coherence of treating cases of VM patients as cases of\namoralism would no longer apply.\n\nWhether or not Roskies\u2019 (2006 and 2007) replies to many of these\nobjections are successful, there are reasons to doubt that the data\nRoskies cites is sufficient to undermine internalism. Roskies herself\nacknowledges that some versions of internalism (though ones she\nconsiders problematic or as yet insufficiently developed) may be\nconsistent with the data on VM patients.(2003: 62\u201363) Schroeder\net al. (2010: 95) note that research suggests that psychopaths have a\n\u201cdiminished capacity to distinguish moral from conventional\nviolations,\u201d which has led some to conclude that they have\n\u201cimpaired moral concepts\u201d (2010: 96, citing Nichols 2004).\nIf they do have impaired moral concepts, then they pose no problem for\nthe internalist. In the case of VM patients, however, they note that\nit has \u201cbeen argued that people exhibiting acquired sociopathy\ndo not exhibit moral deficits at all, but that their deficits in\nnon-moral aspects of life merely manifest occasionally in moral\nsituations.\u201d Further studies, they indicate, will be needed to\nresolve the question of whether VM patients pose a threat to what\nSchroeder et al. call cognitivism and Roskies calls motive-internalism\n(2010: 97). In any case, it is disputed how best to explain the extant\ndata on VM patients. VM patients who suffer injury early in life\nexhibit sociopathic behavior, including violent behavior, whereas VM\npatients who acquire their injuries later in life do not. In dispute\nis whether the latter patients are not violent, for example, because\ntheir moral judgments are to some degree motivating or whether their\nnonviolent behavior is a function of habit (98). Finally, as Roskies\n(2007: 205) carefully explains, \u201cthe evidence is inconclusive\nbecause the best-designed tests of the cognition and behavior of VM\npatients have not yet been done\u201d. \n\nPrinz (2015) has argued, in contrast to Roskies, that empirical\nevidence supports internalism. He argues first that \u201cinternalism\ncan be understood as a psychological thesis\u201d (61), rather than a\nconceptual or a priori truth, and then offers several empirical\narguments in support of it. The first appeals to a view called\n\u201csentimentalism\u201d. \n\nMoral judgments consist of emotional attitudes.\nEmotional attitudes are motivating.\nTherefore, moral judgments are motivating. (70)\n\n\nThe controversial step in the argument is the first premise. Prinz\nsays that premise 1 is a statement of sentimentalism, the view that\n\u201cmoral judgments consist of feelings directed at whatever it is\nthat we moralize\u201d (70). He argues that the thesis supports\nvarious empirical predictions, which studies bear out. First,\nneuroimaging studies on moral cognition provide evidence that\n\u201cpeople enter emotional states when they make moral\njudgments\u201d (71). Second, studies show that induced emotions have\nan impact on moral judgment, and \u201cdifferent emotions have\ndifferent effects\u201d (72). For example, inducing disgust leads\npeople to judge a scenario involving moral wrongness more harshly.\nInduced happiness increases positive moral judgments but not negative,\nwhereas anger increases negative moral judgments but not positive\nmoral judgments (72). Finally, people with differing emotional\ndispositions differ in moral judgments. For example,\n\u201cpsychopaths, who have deficits in several negative emotions,\nbut not disgust, show insensitivity to crimes against persons, but are\nnot known for sexual deviancy\u201d (73), whereas those with\nHuntington\u2019s disease have deficits in disgust, and exhibit\npatterns of sexual deviancy (72). These findings, Prinz contends,\n\u201cadd support to the claim that emotions are components of moral\njudgments. Emotions occur when people make moral judgments, they are\nused as information when reporting strength of moral attitudes, and\nemotional deficits lead to corresponding deficits in moral\nsensitivity\u201d (73). According to Prinz, given this evidence, and\ngiven decades of research that links emotion to behavior, thereby\nsupporting premise 2, this argument provides strong support for\ninternalism.\n\nWhat the sentimentalist\u2019s claim comes to is far less clear than\nPrinz allows. Sometimes he says that moral judgments \u201cconsist\nof\u201d emotional attitudes, sometimes that they are\n\u201ccomponents\u201d of moral judgments. It isn\u2019t clear,\nhowever, that the evidence provides adequate support for\nsentimentalism, as opposed to the view that emotions (contingently)\naccompany moral judgment. That emotions would accompany moral judgment\nis unsurprising, given the importance of morality to human welfare.\n\n\nPrinz offers four additional arguments, only two of which are\nconsidered briefly here. The first argues from experimental evidence\nthat seems to show that people ordinarily \u201cregard emotions as\nnecessary for having moral attitudes\u201d (75). For example,\nsubjects in one study were asked to assess the moral attitudes of two\nindividuals. Person A smokes marijuana, feels no guilt for doing so,\ndoes not have negative attitudes toward others who do, but\nnevertheless says that he thinks smoking marijuana is morally wrong.\nPerson B smokes marijuana, feels guilt for doing so, has negative\nfeelings toward those who do, but nevertheless says she thinks that\nsmoking marijuana is not morally wrong. The majority of respondents\nconcluded that the first smoker does not really think smoking\nmarijuana is morally wrong, whereas the second really does think it is\nmorally wrong, despite his claims to the contrary. Prinz says that\n\u201cthe majority treat emotions as necessary and sufficient for\nmoral attribution,\u201d which suggests that \u201cthe ordinary folk\nare committed to a kind of sentimentalism.\u201d This at most would\nshow us what ordinary folks think, though; it would not support\nsentimentalism as a metaphysical thesis \u201cthat it is part of the\nessence of moral judgments that they can be motivating\u201d (64).\nPrinz speculates that more research might \u201cestablish a more\nconsistent conceptual link between emotions and moral judgments\u201d\n(76). At present, though, the studies Prinz cites are insufficient to\nlend much support to internalism.\n\nThe second of Prinz\u2019s other arguments appeals to studies showing\nthat people are sometimes motivated to act morally, even when it would\nbe instrumentally rational not to. He suggests that the\n\u201csimplest explanation is that moral judgments have motivational\nforce, independent of nonmoral motivation\u201d (77). But\nexternalists are at least as well-positioned to explain the evidence\nby appealing to acculturation and common desires to help others or to\ndo the right thing. \n\nEmpirical research on moral motivation is, of course, of great\ninterest in its own right. But many would doubt the relevance of such\nresearch to what internalists take to be a conceptual claim, a claim\nabout a necessary connection between moral judgment and moral\nmotivation. Even supposing that empirical research could help to\nresolve the impasse between internalists and externalists, the extant\nresearch is far from doing so.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Aiken, H., 1950, \u201cEvaluation and Obligation,\u201d\n<em>Journal of Philosophy</em>, 47: 5\u201322.", "Alston, W., 1967, \u201cMotives and Motivation\u201d, in\nP.
