    "main_text": "Wolff on Philosophy, Science, and Method\n3. Wolff on Philosophy, Science, and Method\n\nEarly in his career, until shortly after his expulsion from Halle,\nWolff primarily presented his work in the German vernacular. His\nreasons for choosing German, rather than Latin, the standard languages\nfor academic texts in Germany at the time, were both tactical and\ntheoretical. Before Wolff, there were very few philosophical works\nwritten in German. By providing treatises on logic and metaphysics,\nWolff was able to service a noticeable gap in the German university\ncurriculum while at the same time promoting his own philosophical\nagenda. Prior to Wolff\u2019s contributions, the standard text books\nin philosophy were largely outdated Lutheran-scholastic treatises\nmodeled after the treatises of Philipp Melanchthon (1497\u20131560)\n(cf. Beck 1969: 189\u201394, 101\u201310). Unlike English and French\nuniversities, which had set aside hidebound scholasticism and embraced\nmodern ideas and systems, German universities (often under the direct\njurisdiction of local theological authorities) were slow to make such\na change.\n\nBut Wolff also had deep-seated theoretical reasons for writing a\nGerman-language philosophy. He believed that the goal and purpose of\nphilosophy should not only be rooted in what he calls \u201cthe\npursuit of the knowledge of the truth\u201d but also in its utility\nand the practical value it has for humans in their everyday life. In\nthe preface to his German Logic, he writes: \n\n\na person should learn philosophy \u2026[not with] a view to the\nvicious taste of the schools for idle disputation and wrangling, but\nin order to [enjoy its] usefulness in future life\u2026. (GL:\nlxxvii; cf. also Corr 1970) \n\n\nBy writing a German-language philosophy, Wolff sought to transform\nphilosophy from a discipline that had become mired in formalism and\ncentered around traditionally defined topics to a discipline that had\ngenuine utility for German students.\n\nAmong the practical aims of Wolff\u2019s philosophy is outfitting the\nmind with the tools it needs to pursue and attain properly scientific\nknowledge, in contrast with \u201ccommon\u201d or\n\u201cvulgar\u201d knowledge, or as Wolff sometimes says \u201cthe\nnatural way of thinking\u201d. If certain groups of facts can be\nshown to follow from \u201cwell-grounded\u201d assumptions according\nto strict requirements of demonstration, the class of facts is deemed\nby Wolff to constitute a \u201cscience\u201d. Wolff gives several\ndefinitions of the term science:\n\n\nBy science, I understand, that habit of the understanding, whereby, in\na manner not to be refuted, we establish our assertions on\nirrefragable grounds or principles (GL: c. 1, \u00a72).\n\nBy science here I mean the habit of demonstrating propositions, i.e.,\nthe habit of inferring conclusions by legitimate sequence from certain\nand immutable principles (DP: \u00a730).\n\nScience is the capacity to prove from indisputable grounds everything\none asserts or, in a word, the capacity to demonstrate; and in\ndemonstration truths are connected together; therefore through science\none knows the connection of truths, and thus science comes from reason\n(GM: \u00a7383).\n\n\nWhile Wolff emphasizes that science is a \u201chabit of the\nunderstanding\u201d, this should be taken to also involve the human\ncapacity of reason, inasmuch as it is the faculty for\nperceiving the connection between truths. When properly employed,\nthen, human reason can discern groups of facts, establish a certain\norder and interconnectedness between these facts, and ultimately\njustify them as being certain parts of human knowledge. Put slightly\ndifferently, science is a disposition or ability of the human mind to\nconceive the facts of reality in an ordered and structured way.\nIndividual sciences, therefore, such as theology, cosmology, or\npsychology, are simply the various sets, or subsets of demonstrable\ncognitions and the principles (including axioms, definitions, and\nempirical facts) from which they are derived.\n\nWolff\u2019s system is also structured according to a notion of\nrational order. The \u201corder of science\u201d pertains to the\nrelationship not only between individual sciences but also between the\nsets of discoverable facts within each given discipline (cf. DP:\n\u00a7\u00a7132\u20135). The central idea here is that certain truths\nare known prior to, and serve as a basis for discovering, other\ntruths. And just as there are certain facts that are more fundamental\nand serve as a basis for discovering other facts, there are, Wolff\nbelieves, certain sciences whose subject matter is more basic and\nwhich ultimately stand as the foundation for other sciences that have\na more specialized focus. For example, in the \u201corder of\ndemonstration\u201d, physics follows general cosmology which, in\nturn, follows ontology (or first philosophy) (DP:\n\u00a7\u00a794\u20135).\n\nIt appears, at first glance, that Wolff\u2019s insistence on the\nrational order of science simply follows from a dogmatic metaphysical\nclaim about the structure of reality. A reasonable objection to Wolff\nmight be that his conception of the rational order of science is based\non an unwarranted assumption about the harmonious order he believes to\nbe present in all facets of reality. This harmonious order (the\nobjection continues) illicitly presupposes that a divine architect has\ncreated everything according to a plan and thus the rational order of\nhuman science is simply an upshot of God\u2019s creative power. There\nare certainly passages of Wolff\u2019s works that lend support to\nsuch an objection (see for instance GL: c. 16, \u00a73). However, to\nreduce Wolff\u2019s view of the rational order of science to simply a\ndogmatic metaphysical claim really ignores the practical and common\nsense dimensions to his thought. An important part of the reason why\nWolff believes that there is a rational order to science is because of\nthe progress he believes he has witnessed in such sciences as\nastronomy and optics, which he believes have utilized such an order\nwhen establishing various scientific truths (DP: \u00a7139). By virtue\nof the very interconnectedness of the different disciplines (most\nnotably, mathematics with physics and physics with astronomy) the\nclaim for an intrinsic rational order among the sciences is seen by\nWolff to be a pragmatic explanation for what is already largely\nobserved and accepted as the status quo among many natural\nphilosophers (GL: c. 1, \u00a739). Unlike Leibniz, Wolff was much more\nwilling to embrace the advances brought in the name of Newtonian\nnatural philosophy (on this, see the next section).\n\nWolff gives the following definition of philosophy in his German\nLogic: \u201c[p]hilosophy is the science of all\npossible things, together with the manner and reason of their\npossibility\u201d (Preface, \u00a71). Now because of its subject\nmatter, philosophy is considered by Wolff to be the broadest and most\nfundamental science. In the classification of sciences given in his\nPreliminary Discourse, Wolff first divides philosophy into\ntwo branches: practical philosophy, on one hand, and theoretical\nphilosophy, on the other. Practical philosophy deals (in general) with\nhuman actions and includes morality, politics, jurisprudence, and\neconomics. Theoretical philosophy, by contrast, deals with sets of\npossible and actual objects and is (itself) divided into three\nseparate branches: (1) ontology, or metaphysics proper, (2)\n\u201cspecial\u201d metaphysics, which includes general cosmology,\npsychology and natural theology, and (3) physics (DP: \u00a792).\nWhereas ontology and general cosmology are considered by Wolff to be\ncompletely \u201cpure\u201d (or a priori) sciences,\npsychology, natural theology, and physics are considered to be based\nupon empirical (i.e., historical) principles. As a brief aside, Wolff\nand the Critical Kant hold very different views on the relationship\nbetween practical and theoretical philosophy. Whereas Wolff believes\nthat all of practical philosophy is subordinated to metaphysics (i.e.,\nontology as well as the three sub-disciplines that comprise special\nmetaphysics), the Critical Kant argues for the independence of\npractical from theoretical principles. Wolff, in stark contrast,\nmaintains that discoveries and conclusions made in practical\nphilosophy are necessarily based upon prior conclusions drawn from\nontology or metaphysics.\n\nBefore turning to an examination of Wolff\u2019s theoretical\nphilosophy, and metaphysics in particular, it will be helpful to first\nconsider Wolff\u2019s distinctive, and often misunderstood,\nrationalism.\n",
