    "main_text": "Phenomenological Approaches\n5. Phenomenological Approaches\n\nThe symptoms of mental disorder are primarily, if not exclusively,\nstates about which their subject can claim a sort of authority. (Since\nin describing these states subjects can intentionally or\nunintentionally mislead, such loosely phenomenological [or\n\u201cexperience-near\u201d] reports\u2014however\nnecessary\u2014may nonetheless present epistemic limitations as data\n(Kontos 2016).) Psychology can provide reliable behavioral assessments\nof disorder, and indicate its presence through laboratory performance\ntests. But no mental disorder is thus far independently verifiable\n(though blood tests or scans, for example). First person reports play\na special part in understanding such disorder for the clinician, or\nfor the researcher, and those establishing philosophical analyses are\nsimilarly beholden (Flanagan 2011; Varga 2015). Carl Jaspers\u2019\nGeneral Psychopathology, which combines close, clinical\ndescription with the method and presuppositions of existential and\nphenomenological thinkers such as Husserl and Heidegger, has been\nwidely discussed. This pairing of clinical and philosophical knowledge\nmakes him one of the undisputed originators of the research field\nknown as the philosophy of psychiatry and psychopathology (Jaspers1913\n[1963]).) Confusingly, not every loosely\n\u201cphenomenological\u201d clinical approach focused on the\npatient\u2019s experience and report adheres to all of the tenets of\nthe philosophical discipline of Phenomenology derived from these\ntraditions, however (see Parnas & Sass 2008).\n\nThe phenomenological strand of philosophical analysis influenced by\nthinkers like Husserl and Heidegger remains focused on immediate,\nfirst person report (for example, self-experience in psychosis (Parnas\n& Sass 2008; Madeira, Pienkos, et al. 2019)); disordered temporal\nexperience (Fuchs 2005, 2013); delusional states (Parnas & Sass\n2008; Gallagher 2005, 2013); and affective disturbances (Ratcliffe\n2008; Ratcliffe & Stephan 2014; Jacobs et. al. 2014)). In these\ntraditions neither psychology nor psychopathology are empirical\nsciences in the usual sense because they involve distinctive forms of\nexplanation. Arising within nineteenth century social science, the\nhermeneutical approach involving meanings calls for Verstehen\n(understanding), a distinctive, interpretive way of apprehending human\naction. (See Jaspers 1913 [1963]; Phillips 2013,Wiggins & Schwartz\n2011; Spitzer & Uehlein 1992.) These differences of approach bring\ndiffering orientations towards fundamentals, and writing following\nGerman and French traditions has been placed in contrast to the\n\u201cAnglo-empiricist\u201d approach judged more influenced by\nempirical science, and showing greater emphasis on objectivity and\nmeasurement (Mullen 2011; see also Gergel 2012).\n\nThese differences bring contrasting theories about psychology as\nscience. Whether, bypassing diagnostic categories and medical disease\nmodels entirely, symptoms and the subjective life of the patient\nshould be the main or even sole locus of attention, is one\n(Stanghellini 2004); another is whether the experiences associated\nwith psychosis, particularly, must be categorically divorced from more\ntypical psychological processes (Sass 2001; Parnas & Sass 2008).\nEmphasizing the unique challenges imposed by interpretation in\npsychiatry, Somogy Varga has argued for a hermeneutics distinctive to\npsychiatry that is grounded in ideas about the self-interpreting\naspect of human beings, \u201cmental disorder\u201d thus standing in\nan asymmetrical relation that is supervenes on our self identities\n(Varga 2015).\n\nThere is disagreement over the correct application of phenomenological\nmethod (Mishara 2007; Sass, Parnas, & Zahavi 2011). But\npsychopathology likely offers a challenge so great as to call for a\nrange of approaches (Ratcliffe 2011; Wiggins and Schwartz 2011;\nGallagher 2013). Attempts have also been made to combine\nphenomenological with empirical approaches: Matthew Ratcliffe\u2019s\nwork on affective states employs social research methods, for example\n(Ratcliffe 2008; Ratcliffe & Stephan 2014). And efforts to tie in\nphenomenological theorizing with findings in neuroscience have yielded\nthe hybrid methodology of phenomenological clinical neuroscience\nadvocating an initial study of subjective experience to only\nthen be probed for its underlying neurobiology (Mishara 2007:\n34).\n\nThe merging of empirical and phenomenological methodologies is also\nreadily supported by the tenets of embodied and enactive cognition.\nConceptions of the embodied, embedded, and sense-making enactive mind\nbring emphasis on the way, shaped by perceptual experience,\nconsciousness and the first person perspective form the basis of all\nmental processing (Varela, Thompson, & Rosch 1991; Durt, Fuchs,\n& Tewes 2017; Di Paolo & De Jaegher 2017). Applied to mental\ndisorder, this departure from classical cognitivist assumptions and\nanalogies suggests that at least some disorder grows out of\ndisturbances in embodied interaction with the environment, and not\nfrom dysfunctions occurring in high-level cognitive mechanisms\n(Drayson 2009; Stanghellini 2004, 2016; Maiese\n 2016).[6]\n",
