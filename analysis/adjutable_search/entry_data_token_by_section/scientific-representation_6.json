    "main_text": "The Structuralist Conception || Structures and the Problem of Ontology\n4.1 Structures and the Problem of Ontology\n\nAlmost anything from a concert hall to a kinship system can be\nreferred to as a \u201cstructure\u201d. So the first task for a\nstructuralist account of representation is to articulate what notion\nof structure it employs. A number of different notions of structure\nhave been discussed in the literature (for a review see Thomson-Jones\n2011), but by far the most common is the notion of structure one finds\nin set theory and mathematical logic. A structure \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) in\nthat sense (sometimes \u201cmathematical structure\u201d or\n\u201cset-theoretic structure\u201d) is a composite entity\nconsisting of the following: a non-empty set \\(U\\) of objects called\nthe domain (or universe) of the structure and an indexed set \\(R\\) of\nrelations on \\(U\\) (supporters of the partial structures approach,\ne.g., Da Costa and French (2003) and Bueno, French, and Ladyman\n(2002), use partial \\(n\\)-place relations, for which it may be\nundefined whether or not some \\(n\\)-tuples are in their extension).\nThis definition of structure is widely used in mathematics and logic.\nWe note, however, that in mathematical logic structures also contain a\nlanguage and an interpretation function, interpreting symbols of the\nlanguage in terms of \\(U\\) (see for instance Machover 1996 and Hodges\n1997), which is absent from structures in the current context. It is\nconvenient to write these as \\(\\mathcal{S}= \\langle U, R \\rangle\\),\nwhere \u201c\\(\\langle \\, , \\rangle\\)\u201d denotes an ordered\ntuple.\n\nIt is important to be clear on what we mean by \u201cobject\u201d\nand \u201crelation\u201d in this context. As regards objects, all\nthat matters from a structuralist point of view is that there are so\nand so many of them. Whether the objects are desks or planets is\nirrelevant. All we need are dummies or placeholders whose only\nproperty is \u201cobjecthood\u201d. Similarly, when defining\nrelations one disregards completely what the relation is \u201cin\nitself\u201d. Whether we talk about \u201cbeing the mother of\u201d\nor \u201cstanding to the left of\u201d is of no concern in the\ncontext of a structure; all that matters is between which objects it\nholds. For this reason, a relation is specified purely extensionally:\nas a class of ordered \\(n\\)-tuples. The relation literally is nothing\nover and above this class. So a structure consists of dummy-objects\nbetween which purely extensionally defined relations hold.\n\nThe first basic posit of the structuralist theory of representation is\nthat models are structures in this sense (the second is that models\nrepresent their targets by being suitably morphic to them; we discuss\nmorphisms in the next subsection). Suppes has articulated this stance\nclearly when he declared that \u201cthe meaning of the concept of\nmodel is the same in mathematics and the empirical sciences\u201d\n(1960 [1969]: 12), and many have followed suit. So we are presented\nwith a clear answer to the Problem of Ontology: models are structures.\nThe remaining issue is what structures themselves are. Are they\nPlatonic entities, equivalence classes, modal constructs, or yet\nsomething else? In the context of a discussion of scientific\nrepresentation one can push these questions off to the philosophy of\nmathematics (see the SEP entries on the\n philosophy of mathematics,\n nominalism in the philosophy of mathematics, and\n Platonism in the philosophy of mathematics\n for further details).\n",
