Careful weighing combined with an\napplication of the law of constant proportions allowed chemists to\ncharacterize substances in terms of the mass ratios of their\nconstituent elements, which is what chemists mean by the composition\nof a compound. During this period, Berzelius developed a notation of\ncompositional formulas for these mass ratios where letters stand for\nelements and subscripts stand for proportions on a scale which\nfacilitates comparison of different substances. Although these\nproportions reflect the proportion by weight in grams, the simple\nnumbers are a result of reexpressing gravimetric proportions in terms\nof chemical equivalents. For example, the formulas\n\u2018H2O\u2019 and \u2018H2S\u2019 say that\nthere is just as much oxygen in combination with hydrogen in water as\nthere is sulphur in combination with hydrogen in hydrogen sulphide.\nHowever, when measured in weight, \u2018H2O\u2019\ncorresponds to combining proportions of 8 grams of oxygen to 1 gram of\nhydrogen and \u2018H2S\u2019 corresponds to 16 grams of\nsulphur to 1 of hydrogen in weight.\n\nBy the first decades of the 19th century, the nascent\nsub-discipline of organic chemistry began identifying and synthesizing\never increasing numbers of compounds (Klein 2003). As indicated in\nsection 2.2, it was during this period that the phenomenon of\nisomerism was recognized, and structural formulas were introduced to\ndistinguish substances with the same compositional formula that differ\nin their macroscopic properties. Although some chemists thought\nstructural formulas could be understood on a macroscopic basis, others\nsought to interpret them as representations of microscopic entities\ncalled molecules, corresponding to the smallest unit of a compound as\nan atom was held to be the smallest unit of an element.\n\nIn the first half of the nineteenth century there was no general\nagreement about how the notion of molecular structure could be\ndeployed in understanding isomerism. But during the second half of the\ncentury, consensus built around the structural theories of August\nKekul\u00e9 (1829\u20131896). Kekul\u00e9 noted that carbon\ntended to combine with univalent elements in a 1:4 ratio. He argued\nthat this was because each carbon atom could form bonds to four other\natoms, even other carbon atoms (1858 [1963], 127). In later papers,\nKekul\u00e9 dealt with apparent exceptions to carbon\u2019s valency of\nfour by introducing the concept of double bonds between carbon atoms.\nHe extended his treatment to aromatic compounds, producing the famous\nhexagonal structure for benzene (see Rocke 2010), although this was to\ncreate a lasting problem for the universality of carbon\u2019s valency of 4\n(Brush 1999a, 1999b).\n\nKekul\u00e9\u2019s ideas about bonding between atoms were important steps\ntoward understanding isomerism. Yet his presentations of structure\ntheory lacked a clear system of diagrammatic representation so most\nmodern systems of structural representation originate with Alexander\nCrum Brown\u2019s (1838\u20131932) paper about isomerism among organic\nacids (1864 [1865]). Here, structure was shown as linkages between\natoms (see Figure 3).\n\n\nFigure 3. Depictions of ethane and formic acid in Crum Brown\u2019s graphic\nnotation. (1864 [1865], 232)\n\n\nEdward Frankland (1825\u20131899) simplified and popularized Crum\nBrown\u2019s notation in successive editions of his Lecture Notes for\nChemical Students (Russell 1971; Ritter 2001). Frankland was\nalso the first to introduce the term \u2018bond\u2019 for the\nlinkages between atoms (Ramberg 2003).\n\nThe next step in the development of structural theory came when James\nDewar (1842\u20131943) and August Hofmann (1818\u20131892) developed\nphysical models corresponding closely to Crum Brown\u2019s formulae\n(Meinel 2004). Dewar\u2019s molecules were built from carbon atoms\nrepresented by black discs placed at the centre of pairs of copper\nbands. In Hofmann\u2019s models, atoms were colored billiard balls (black\nfor carbon, white for hydrogen, red for oxygen etc.) linked by bonds.\nEven though they were realized by concrete three-dimensional\nstructures of croquet balls and connecting arms, the\nthree-dimensionality of these models was artificial. The medium itself\nforced the representations of atoms to be spread out in space. But did\nthis correspond to chemical reality?\n\nKekul\u00e9, Crum Brown, and Frankland were extremely cautious when\nanswering this question. Kekul\u00e9 distinguished between the\napparent atomic arrangement which could be deduced from chemical\nproperties, which he called \u201cchemical structure,\u201d and the\ntrue spatial arrangement of the atoms (Rocke 1984, 2010). Crum Brown\nmade a similar distinction, cautioning that in his graphical formulae\nhe did not \u201cmean to indicate the physical, but merely the\nchemical position of the atoms\u201d (Crum Brown, 1864, 232).\nFrankland noted that \u201cIt must carefully be borne in mind that\nthese graphic formulae are intended to represent neither the shape of\nthe molecules, nor the relative position of the constituent\natoms\u201d (Biggs et al. 1976, 59).\n\nOne way to interpret these comments is that they reflect a kind of\nanti-realism: Structural formulae are merely theoretical tools for\nsummarizing a compound\u2019s chemical behavior. Or perhaps they are simply\nagnostic, avoiding definite commitment to a microscopic realm about\nwhich little can be said. However, other comments suggest a realist\ninterpretation, but one in which structural formulae represent only\nthe topological structure of the spatial arrangement:\n\nThe lines connecting the different atoms of a compound, and which\nmight with equal propriety be drawn in any other direction, provided\nthey connected together the same elements, serve only to show the\ndefinite disposal of the bonds: thus the formula for nitric acid\nindicates that two of the three constituent atoms of oxygen are\ncombined with nitrogen alone, whilst the third oxygen atom is combined\nboth with nitrogen and hydrogen (Frankland, quoted in Biggs et al.\n1976, 59; also see Hendry 2010b).\n\n\nThe move towards a fully spatial interpretation was advanced by the\nsimultaneous postulation in 1874 of a tetrahedral structure for the\norientation of carbon\u2019s four bonds by Jacobus van \u2019t Hoff\n(1852\u20131911) and Joseph Achille Le Bel (1847\u20131930) to\naccount for optical isomerism (see Figure 4 and section 2.2). When\ncarbon atoms are bonded to four different constituents, they cannot be\nsuperimposed on their mirror images, just as your left and right hands\ncannot be. This gives rise to two possible configurations of\nchiral molecules, thus providing for a distinction between\ndistinct substances whose physical and chemical properties are the\nsame except for their ability to rotate plane polarized light in\ndifferent directions. \n\nvan \u2019t Hoff and Le Bel provided no account of the mechanism by which\nchiral molecules affect the rotation of plane polarized light\n(Needham 2004). But by the end of the century, spatial structure was\nbeing put to use in explaining the aspects of the reactivity and\nstability of organic compounds with Viktor Meyer\u2019s (1848\u20131897)\nconception of steric hindrance and Adolf von Baeyer\u2019s\n(1835\u20131917) conception of internal molecular strain (Ramberg\n2003).\n\n\nFigure 4.

Compare the positions of\nsubstituents Y and Z.\n\n\nGiven that these theories were intrinsically spatial, traditional\nquestions about chemical combination and valency took a new direction:\nWhat is it that holds the atoms together in a particular spatial\narrangement? The answer, of course, is the chemical bond.\n",
