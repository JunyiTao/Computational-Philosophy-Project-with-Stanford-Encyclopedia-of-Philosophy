Are states of affairs n-tuples that\nhave objects and properties as members? Is, for example, the state of\naffairs Socrates\u2019s being wise nothing but the ordered\npair \\(\\langle\\)Socrates, being wise\\(\\rangle\\)? Plantinga answers\nNO:\n\n\nClearly there are many set-theoretical models of our talk about states\nof affairs and individuals. Why pick any of them as more revealing\nthan the others? (Plantinga 1984: 327)\n\n\nWe can model states of affairs as ordered n-tuples in many different\nways. But there seems no way to decide between \\(\\langle\\)Socrates,\nbeing wise\\(\\rangle\\) and \\(\\langle\\)being wise, Socrates\\(\\rangle\\)\nas the right model for the state of affairs. Hence, the state of\naffairs is not identical with either ordered pair (see Pollock 1984b:\n138).\n\nSome philosophers spell out \u201cinvolvement\u201d as containment:\nA state of affairs is a complex that contains properties and\nparticulars as parts. In order to assess this proposal, let\nus first sharpen our understanding of the part-of relation. It is\ncontroversial weather the relation we aim to pick out with\n\u201cpart-of\u201d is reflexive (everything is part of itself) or\nnot. But it is not controversial that the relation is transitive (if\nx is a part of y, and y is a part of\nz, x is a part of z) and antisymmetrical (if\nx is part of y, and y is a part of x,\nx is identical to y) (see the entry on\n mereology,\n sect. 2 and 3). A further plausible principle governing our part-of\nrelation is the supplementation principle: if x is a part of\ny, there is an object z that is part of y and\nz does overlap, that is, have a part in common, with\nx. The supplementation principle implies the intuitively\nplausible view that nothing can have a single proper part. The\nsupplementation principle together with the uncontroversial axioms for\nthe (proper) part-of relation also implies the more controversial\nthesis that complex objects with the same parts are identical (see\nentry on\n mereology,\n 3.2).\n\nThe transitivity of part-of immediately gives rise to problems. For\ninstance, Frege wrote to Wittgenstein:\n\n\n[If Vesuvius is part of a state of affairs,] it seems that parts of\nVesuvius must also be parts of this fact; the fact will hence also\nconsist of solidified lava. This does not seem right to me. (Frege\n1919: 20; my translation)\n\n\nIf Vesuvius is part of the obtaining state of affairs\nVesuvius\u2019s being a volcano, the state of affairs must\nby the transitivity of part-of contain the parts of solidified lava\nthat are parts of Vesuvius. But if the state of affairs contains the\nsolidified lava as parts, it must have a weight and an extension etc.\nHowever, the state of affairs Vesuvius\u2019s being a\nvolcano is not a thing that has weight etc.\n\nThere are further problems for the view that states of affairs are\ncomplexes. If the state of affairs a\u2019s being\nF has only a and being F as its\nparts (in any plausible sense of \u201cpart\u201d), it can only\nexist at a time at which a and being F exist\n(the sum of all my body parts exists only at the time when all my body\nparts exist). Hence, the state of affairs a\u2019s\nceasing to exist before b\u2019s starting to exist cannot be\na complex containing a and b. For there is no time when\nits constituents both exist (see K\u00fcnne 2003: 122).\n\nThe principles for the (proper) part-of relation imply that complexes\nwith the same parts are identical. But take the state of affairs that\nRomeo loves Juliet. If it has Romeo, Love and Juliet as its parts, it\nis the same as the state of affairs that Juliet loves Romeo. But\nintuitively, the state of affairs Juliet\u2019s loving Romeo\nis different from the state of affairs Romeo\u2019s loving\nJuliet. On the standard mereological conception of part,\nparticulars and universals are not parts of states of affairs.\n",
