    "main_text": "\n\nIssues in social and political thought have been central to Chinese\nphilosophy from its earliest moments down to the present day. Neither\n\u201csocial\u201d nor \u201cpolitical\u201d have ready correlates\nin Chinese prior to the nineteenth century, but Chinese thinkers\nconsistently have been concerned with understanding how both\nindividuals and institutions have broad effects in what we can call\nboth social and political modes. In some cases, the philosophers\nnarrowly focus on governance and the state, but in many other cases,\nno firm distinction is made between the realms of political, social,\nand even family or individual. The scope of social and political\nthought, and its relation to other concerns like individual ethics,\nare discussed in\n Section 1.\n\nThe bulk of this entry is arranged chronologically, beginning with the\nmost important texts of the classical (or pre-Imperial) era; then\nbriefly attending to developments in the early Imperial era; next\nlooking more carefully at some of the key developments in the 800-year\nNeo-Confucian era; and ending with Chinese social and political\nthinking over the last 150 years. The organization within each section\ndiffers because of differences in our sources. While theories\nconcerning the composition and dating of classical texts remain\nintensely controversial, it is at least clear that our default should\nnot be to treat these texts as the products of single authors at a\nsingle time, much less as representing the theories of\nwell-established schools of thought. Instead, it makes sense to take\nindividual texts, and sometimes individual chapters, as our basic\nunits of analysis. The nature and authorship of sources are clearer as\nwe move into later eras, and so a topical organization makes sense for\nsubsequent sections of the entry.\n\nSeveral questions are central to the teachings and debates that make\nup Chinese social and political thought, among which the issue of how\nto sustain \u201corder (zhi)\u201d\u2014often understood\nmore particularly as \u201charmony (he)\u201d\u2014is the\nmost basic. To what degree should we rely on institutions (and of what\nkinds?), and to what degree is human leadership crucial? What sorts of\nroles, relationships, or hierarchies should structure our societies,\nand how are they justified? Can they be challenged or changed? Insofar\nas society is divided into rulers and ruled, what are the\nresponsibilities that each owes to the other, and why? We will see\nthat social and political topics routinely connect up with other\naspects of Chinese philosophy\u2014for example, answers to some of\nthe questions just raised lead to further ethical, epistemic, or\nmetaphysical questions\u2014but for the most part it is still\npossible to make sense of social and political thought in its own\nterms.\n",
