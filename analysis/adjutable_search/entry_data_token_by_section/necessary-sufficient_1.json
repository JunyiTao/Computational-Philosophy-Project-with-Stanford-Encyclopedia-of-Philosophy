    "main_text": "The Standard Theory: Truth-functions and Reciprocity\n2. The Standard Theory: Truth-functions and Reciprocity\n\nThe front door is locked. In order to open it in a normal way and get\ninto the house, I must first use my key. A necessary condition of\nopening the door, without violence, then, is to use the key. So it\nseems true that\n\nIf I opened the door, I used the key.\n\n\nCan we use the truth-functional understanding of \u201cif\u201d to\npropose that the consequent of any conditional (in (i), the consequent\nis \u201cI used the key\u201d) specifies a necessary condition for\nthe truth of the antecedent (in (i), \u201cI opened the door\u201d)?\nMany logic and critical thinking texts use just such an approach, and\nfor convenience it can be called \u201cthe standard theory\u201d\n(see Blumberg 1976, pp. 133\u20134, Hintikka and Bachman 1991, p.\n328, Moore and Parker 2009, 310\u201311, and Southworth and Swoyer\n2020, ch. 3.2 for examples of this approach).\n\nThe standard theory makes use of the fact that in classical logic, the\ntruth-function \u201cp \u2283 q\u201d (\u201cIf\np, q\u201d) is false only when p is true\nand q is false. The relation between \u201cp\u201d\nand \u201cq\u201d in this case is sometimes referred to as\nmaterial implication (see the entry on\n the logic of conditionals).\n On this account of \u201cif p, q\u201d, if the\nconditional \u201cp \u2283 q\u201d is true, and\np holds, then q also holds; likewise if q\nis false, then p must also be false (if the conditional is\ntrue). The standard theory claims that when the conditional\n\u201cp \u2283 q\u201d is true the truth of the\nconsequent, \u201cq\u201d, is necessary for the\ntruth of the antecedent, \u201cp\u201d, and the truth of\nthe antecedent is in turn sufficient for the truth of the\nconsequent. This reciprocal relation between necessary and sufficient\nconditions matches the formal equivalence between a conditional\nformula and its contrapositive (\u201c~q \u2283\n~p\u201d is the contrapositive of \u201cp\n\u2283 q\u201d). Descending from talk of truth of statements\nto speaking about states of affairs, we can equally correctly say, on\nthe standard theory, that using the key was a necessary condition of\nopening the door.\n\nGiven the standard theory, necessary and sufficient conditions are\nconverses of each other: B\u2019s being a necessary\ncondition of A is equivalent to A\u2019s being a\nsufficient condition of B (and vice versa). So it seems that\nany truth-functional conditional sentence states both a sufficient and\na necessary condition as well. Suppose that if Nellie is an elephant,\nthen she has a trunk. Being an elephant is a sufficient condition of\nher having a trunk; having a trunk in turn is a necessary condition of\nNellie\u2019s being an elephant. Indeed, the claim about the\nnecessary condition appears to be another way of putting the claim\nabout the sufficient condition, just as the contrapositive of a\nformula is logically equivalent to the original formula.\n\nIt is also possible\u2014according the the standard theory\u2014to\nuse \u201conly if\u201d to identify a necessary condition: we can\nsay that Jonah was swallowed by a whale only if he was swallowed by a\nmammal, for if a creature is not a mammal, it is not a whale.\nEquivalent to (i) above, on this account, is the sentence \u201cI\nopened the door only if I used the key\u201d\u2014a perfectly\nnatural way of indicating that use of the key was necessary for\nopening the door.\n\nThis account of necessary and sufficient conditions is particularly\napposite in dealing with logical inferences. For example, from the\ntruth of a conjunction, it can be inferred that each component is true\n(if \u201cp and q\u201d is true, then\n\u201cp\u201d is true and \u201cq\u201d is\ntrue). Suppose, then, that it is true that it is both raining and\nsunny. This is a sufficient condition for \u201cit is raining\u201d\nto be true. That it is raining is\u2014contrariwise\u2014a necessary\ncondition for it being true that it is both raining and sunny. A\nsimilar account seems to work for conceptual and definitional\ncontexts. So if the concept of memory is analysed as the concept of a\nfaculty for tracking actual past events, the fact that an event is now\nin the past is a necessary condition of my presently recollecting it.\nIf water is chemically defined as a liquid constituted mainly of\nH2O, then if a glass contains water, it contains mainly\nH2O. That the glass contains mostly H2O is a\nnecessary condition of its containing water.\n\nDespite its initial appeal, objections to the standard theory have\nbeen made by theorists from both philosophy and linguistics. In\nsummary, the objections build on the idea that \u201cif\u201d in\nEnglish does not always express a uniform kind of condition. If\ndifferent kinds of conditions are expressed by the word\n\u201cif\u201d, the objectors argue, then it would be wise to\nuncover these before engaging in attempts to formalize and systematize\nthe concepts of necessary and sufficient. In trying\nto show that there is an ambiguity infecting\n\u201cif\u201d-sentences in English, critics have focused on two\ndoctrines they regard as mistaken: first, that there is a reciprocity\nbetween necessary and sufficient conditions, and, second, that\n\u201cif p, q\u201d and \u201cp only if\nq\u201d are equivalent.\n",
