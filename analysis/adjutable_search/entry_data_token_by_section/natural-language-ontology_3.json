How is natural language ontology compatible\nwith what is widely regarded as a fundamental requirement on semantic\ntheory, namely that of giving truth conditions? For a sentence\nS about an entity d to be true or false, what makes\nS true or false, it seems, needs to be a part of reality that\nincludes d itself, and thus d needs to be a real entity,\nrather than part of an ontology of \u201cappearances\u201d. There\nare various options to pursue, each of which may be adopted for just\nsome part of the ontology reflected in natural language. One option is\nthat natural language displays ontological notions or items that\nsimply fail to be real, and thus speakers making use of them in their\nutterances are in error. Second, entities in the ontology of natural\nlanguage may have the status of fictional entities, which means that a\nsentence about such entities may not be able to be\n\u201creally\u201d be true (unless it predicates a property of the\nfictional entity as a fictional entity, with predicates such\nas is a fictional character) (see entry on\n nonexistent objects, section nuclear and extranuclear properties).\n Third, entities in the ontology of natural language, even if not\nconsidered fundamental, may be considered derivative, yet real, which\nwould allow sentences involving reference to them to be true. As was\nmentioned in\n Section 1.1,\n some proponents of natural language ontology remain agnostic\nregarding the metaphysical status of the items that natural language\nontology posits, as long as they are motivated by empirical\ngeneralizations and theoretical linguistic considerations.\n\nAnother general issue, skeptically addressed in particular by Chomsky,\nis whether referential NPs even have as their semantic function to be\nused to refer to entities and thus whether referentialist semantics is\neven possible\n (\u00a72.2.5).\n Not all approaches to natural language semantics in fact have as\ntheir aim giving truth conditions (whether such an aim is set aside or\nabandoned) and thus rely on referentialist semantics. Chomsky (2000)\nhimself takes the view that the semantics of natural language can\ninvolve only our cognitive representation of the world and thus only\nanother level of syntax, not entities and their properties\nthemselves.\n",
