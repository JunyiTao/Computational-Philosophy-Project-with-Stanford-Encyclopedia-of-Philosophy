    "main_text": "Logic and method || Inventio\n3.2 Inventio\n\nThe Stoics were inclined to concentrate on linguistic rather than\nontological issues. Cicero observed that the Aristotelians were mainly\ninterested in the aspect of logic that he called the ars\ninveniendi, that is, the art of finding the right arguments. The\nStoics, on the other hand, according to Cicero, were more concerned\nabout the different aspects of the judgments that we make. They wanted\nto analyze arguments. He called this kind of dialectic the ratio\ndisserendi, a definition that Ramus, via Agricola, rephrased as\nthe ars bene disserendi. While the Aristotelians thought that\nthe categories were the natural introduction to logic, the Stoics\npreferred judgment.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages both the Peripatetic and the Stoic views on\ndialectic were preserved, the latter via Cicero and Augustine. Petrus\nHispanus\u2019 Summulae consisted of several treatises\n(tractatus). In the first of these students could learn how\nto construct a proposition. In the second Petrus discussed the five\npraedicabilia that made it possible to classify different\nkinds of propositions. The third tractatus dealt with the\nCategories, the fourth and the fifth with the problems that\nAristotle had taken up in his Prior Analytics and in his\nTopics. The last seven treatises were concerned with specific\nlogical problems such as significatio or suppositio.\nWith few exceptions these treatises do not correspond to any part of\nthe Organon; instead, they are for the most part related to\nthe parva logicalia, a form of medieval logical thinking\nwhich was especially repugnant to the humanists. The Posterior\nAnalytics was hardly considered at all. The main emphasis at\nschool was on teaching young boys to construct syllogisms. The purpose\nof the Summulae was not to train the students to reflect on\nthe problem of how to make scientifically correct conclusions but\nrather to prepare them for what they normally were expected to do: to\ntake part in endless series of disputations. In that respect the\nSummulae succeeded (cf. Ong 1958: 55\u201374).\n\nWhile, for Ramus, Petrus Hispanus\u2019 Summulae was like a\nred rag to a bull, he willingly admitted that he had learned a great\ndeal from a more recent book on logic, De inventione libri\ntres by the Dutch humanist Rudolph Agricola (1443\u20131485).\nThis book, printed for the first time in 1515, was to a great extent\ninfluenced by humanism. In many ways Agricola\u2019s logic was based\nless on Aristotle than on Cicero. Aristotle had considered the\nTopics or dialectic as a special kind of deduction. This was\nthe reason why Aristotelians wanted the study of logic to start with\nwhat Cicero and the humanists often called iudicium or\njudgment, to be learned from the Categories, On\nInterpretation and the two Analytics, before the student\nwent on to the Topics. But Agricola disagreed. In his view,\nyou must find the arguments before you can employ them in your\nargumentation. Aristotelians maintained instead that it was necessary\nto know what to do with arguments before you could go looking for\nthem. In fact, Agricola hardly touched on iudicium in the\nmore than 400 pages of his treatise. In concentrating on the\nTopics, it was much easier for him to lean on Cicero rather\nthan on Aristotle. The close connection between inventio, as\na part of logic, and the art of rhetoric made it seem, however, as if\nhumanists could not separate the two disciplines. Another weakness\nwhich Aristotelians often pointed out in Agricola and Ramus was that\nthey were not interested in finding answers to difficult questions but\nrather in finding good arguments to use in defending a certain thesis\n(Sellberg 1979: 58).\n",
