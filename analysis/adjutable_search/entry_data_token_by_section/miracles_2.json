    "main_text": "Concepts and Definitions || Miracles as violations of the laws of nature\n1.2 Miracles as violations of the laws of nature\n\n\nDavid Hume (Hume 1748/2000; cf. Voltaire 1764/1901: 272) famously\ndefined a miracle as \u201ca violation of the laws of nature,\u201d\nand this definition has been the focus of lively discussion ever since.\nHume evidently means to denote something beyond mere changes in the\nregular course of nature, raising the bar higher for something to\nqualify as a miracle but also raising the potential epistemic\nsignificance of such an event if it could be authenticated.\n\n\nBringing the concept of natural laws into the definition of\n\u201cmiracle\u201d is, however, problematic, and for a variety of\nreasons many writers have found it untenable (Brown 1822:\n219\u201333; Beard 1845: 35; Lias 1890: 5\u20137; Huxley\n1894:154\u201358; Joyce 1914: 17; Hesse 1965; Montgomery 1978; but\nsee Wardlaw 1852: 27\u201341). First, the concept of a miracle\npredates any modern concept of a natural law by many centuries. While\nthis does not necessarily preclude Hume\u2019s concept, it does raise the\nquestion of what concept or concepts earlier thinkers had in mind and\nof why the Humean concept should be thought preferable (Tucker 2005).\nOne benefit of defining miracles in terms of violations of natural law\nis that this definition entails that a miracle is beyond the\nproductive power of nature. But if that is the key idea, then it is\nhard to see why we should not simply use that as the definition and\nleave out the problematic talk of laws.\n\n\nSecond, it becomes difficult to say in some cases just which natural\nlaws are being violated by the event in question (Earman 2000). That\ndead men stay dead is a widely observed fact, but it is not, in the\nordinary scientific use of the term, a law of nature that dead men stay\ndead. The laws involved in the decomposition of a dead body are all at\na much more fundamental level, at least at the level of biochemical and\nthermodynamic processes and perhaps at the level of interactions of\nfundamental particles.\n\n\nThird, there are deep philosophical disagreements regarding the\nnature and even the existence of natural laws. On Hume\u2019s own\n\u201cregularity\u201d view of natural laws, it is difficult to see\nwhat it would mean for a natural law to be violated. If the natural\nlaws are simply compendious statements of natural regularities, an\napparent \u201cviolation\u201d would most naturally be an indication,\nnot that a supernatural intervention in the course of nature had\noccurred, but rather that what we had thought was a natural law was, in\nfact, not one. On metaphysically rich conceptions of natural laws,\nviolations are problematic since the laws involve relations of\nnecessity among universals. And on the view that there are no natural\nlaws whatsoever, the set of events satisfying the Humean definition of\na miracle is, trivially, empty.\n\n\nSpeaking of miracles as violations of the laws of nature\nalso raises questions about the nature of violation. Richard Swinburne\n(1970) has suggested that a miracle might be defined as a\nnon-repeatable counter-instance to a law of nature. If a putative law\nhas broad scope, great explanatory power, and appealing simplicity, it\nmay be more reasonable, Swinburne argues, to retain the law (defined as\na regularity that virtually invariably holds) and to accept that the\nevent in question is a non-repeatable counter-instance of that law than\nto throw out the law and create a vastly more complex law that\naccommodates the event.\n\n\nOne way to get around all of these problems and still retain the\nHumean formulation is simply to redefine the laws of nature. J. L.\nMackie sums up this perspective neatly:\n\n\nThe laws of nature \u2026 describe the ways in which the\nworld\u2014including, of course, human beings\u2014works when left to\nitself, when not interfered with. A miracle occurs when the world is\nnot left to itself, when something distinct from the natural order as a\nwhole intrudes into it. (Mackie 1982: 19\u201320)\n\n\nWith the notion of \u201cnatural law\u201d thus redefined, the\n\u201cviolation\u201d definition becomes virtually equivalent to the\nearlier definition of a miracle as an event that exceeds the productive\npower of nature. And in Mackie\u2019s formulation it has the desirable\nfeature that it makes evident the connection between a miracle and\nsupernatural agency.\n",
