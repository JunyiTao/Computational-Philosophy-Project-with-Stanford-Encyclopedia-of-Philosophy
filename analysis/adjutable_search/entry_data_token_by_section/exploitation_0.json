Historical Accounts of Exploitation\n\nAlthough the term \u201cexploitation\u201d appears not to have been\nused to describe unfair advantage-taking prior to the 19th\ncentury, there are nevertheless extensive discussions of the themes\nand problems that characterize contemporary discussions of\nexploitation in the history of philosophy. Those themes include the\nnotion of justice and injustice in economic exchange, the role of\nlabor in the creation of value, and the justification and abuse of\nprivate property, especially in capital and land.\n",
