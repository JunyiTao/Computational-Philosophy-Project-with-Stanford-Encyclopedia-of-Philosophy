    "main_text": "Fundamental ontology: A simplified version\n2. Fundamental ontology: A simplified version\n\nIt will be useful to start with a view that is almost\nLewis\u2019s\u2014almost, but not quite, as it is more opinionated\nthan he would be comfortable with. Stating the view takes but a few\nlines; providing the needed commentary will take longer. Thus,\nAlmost-Lewis says the following:\n\nThe only fundamental entities that are particulars\nare spacetime points.\n\nWhat these particulars are like is given by what perfectly\nnatural monadic properties they instantiate, and what perfectly\nnatural relations they stand in to one another.\n\nAnd that\u2019s it. That is, the facts about what fundamental\nparticulars there are, and what perfectly natural properties and\nrelations they instantiate, determine all other facts, even modal\nfacts. Almost-Lewis\n(and Lewis) believes, of course, in other particulars besides\nspacetime points; it\u2019s just that these particulars are not\nfundamental: what it is for them to exist is to be explained, somehow,\nin terms of facts about the fundamental entities. (See the\n\nSupplement on\n Fundamental Entities\n\n\nfor some qualifications about Lewis\u2019s position.)\n\nNotice one consequence: If the facts about what fundamental\nparticulars there are, and what perfectly natural properties and\nrelations they instantiate, determine all other facts, then\nthere is no reason to suppose that composite\nparticulars\u2014particulars that have other particulars as proper\nparts\u2014ever instantiate perfectly natural monadic properties. (Of\ncourse, they can perfectly well instantiate the very-but-not-perfectly\nnatural property of having parts that instantiate\nsuch-and-such a perfectly natural relation.) Thus, if, for\nexample, my laptop has a mass of 3 kg, that is so only in a slightly\nderivative sense: the laptop is composed of parts whose masses add up\nto 3 kg. As noted, the position of Almost-Lewis is not that of\nLewis, and shortly we will need to review the key respect in which, by\nLewis\u2019s lights, it overreaches. But first we need to elaborate and\nclarify the content of Almost-Lewis\u2019s position, by means of some\ncommentary.\n\n\nFour questions demand attention: What are \u201cperfectly\nnatural\u201d properties and relations? What does it come to to say\nthat the fundamental particulars are spacetime points? What\ndoes it come to to say that they are spacetime points?\nFinally, what is the relationship between the fundamental ontology\nposited by Almost-Lewis and Lewis\u2019s own celebrated thesis of\nHumean Supervenience? Let\u2019s consider these topics in turn.\n\n",
