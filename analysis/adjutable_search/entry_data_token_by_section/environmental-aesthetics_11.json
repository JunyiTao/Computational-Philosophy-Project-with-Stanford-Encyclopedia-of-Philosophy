    "main_text": "Environmental Aesthetics beyond Natural Environments || The Aesthetics of Everyday Life\n4.2 The Aesthetics of Everyday Life\n\nThe aesthetics of everyday life tends to focus on the aesthetics of\nsmaller environments as well as the common objects and the everyday\nactivities that occupy such environments. Thus it investigates not\nonly the aesthetic qualities of more personal environments, such as\nindividual living spaces, for example, yards and houses (Melchionne\n1998 2002, Lee 2010), but also the aesthetic dimensions of normal\nday-to-day experiences (Leddy 1995 2005b 1012b, Saito 2001 2008 2012\n2017b, Haapala 2005, Irvin 2008a 2008b, Mandoki 2010, Maskit 2011).\nMoreover, it explores the aesthetic aspects of somewhat more\nspecialized and perhaps uniquely human interests and activities, such\nas the appreciation of the human body (Davies 2014, Irvin 2016b, Saito\n2016), of sports (Welsch 2005, Edgar 2013), and of food, cuisine, and\ndining (Korsmeyer 1999, Sweeney 2017, Ravasio 2018). There are major\nmonographs that address the general topic of the aesthetics of\neveryday life (Mandoki 2007, Saito 2008 2017a, Leddy 2012b) as well as\nseveral collections (von Bonsdorff and Haapala 1999, Light and Smith\n2005, Yuedi and Carter 2014a, Irvin 2016a) that pursue particular\nareas of interest and thus yield insight into and encourage the\nappreciation of almost every aspect of human life. However, although\nthese various lines of research are clearly very productive, the\ncredentials of the aesthetics of everyday life as an investigation of\ngenuine aesthetic experiences have been challenged, debated, and\ndefended (Dowling 2010, Melchionne 2011 2013 2014, Leddy 2012a 2014\n2015, Naukkarinen 2013 2017, Carlson 2014a, Davies 2015, Puolakka\n2018).\n\nNonetheless, in spite of these challenges and concerns about the\naesthetics of everyday life, when it turns to the investigation of\nthings such as sports and food, it begins to come full circle,\nconnecting environmental aesthetics back to more traditional\naesthetics and to the study of clearly genuine aesthetic experiences.\nBy way of the aesthetics of everyday life, together with the\naesthetics of human environments, environmental aesthetics makes\ncontact with the artistic activities involved not only in sports and\ncuisine, but also in gardening (Miller 1993, Saito 1996, Carlson 1997,\nRoss 1998, Cooper 2006, Parsons 2008a, Chung 2018, Brady et\nal 2018) and in landscaping, architecture, and design (Stecker\n1999, Carlson 2000, Parsons 2008b 2011 2016, Forsey, 2013, Svabo and\nEkelund 2015, van Etteger et al 2016). In addition, and now\nwithin the context of environmental aesthetics, traditional art forms,\nsuch as poetry and literature (Berleant 1991 2004, Ross 1998,\nSep\u00e4nmaa 2004) and painting, sculpture, dance, and music\n(Berleant 1991 2004, Ross 1998, Mullis 2014) as well as newer forms,\nsuch as environmental art (Crawford 1983, Carlson 1986, Ross 1993,\nBrady 2007, Brook 2007, Fisher 2007, Lintott 2007, Parsons 2008a,\nSimus 2008b, Brady et al 2018, Nannicelli 2018), are explored\nand re-explored\u2014both as aesthetically significant dimensions of\nour everyday experiences and concerning their roles in shaping our\naesthetic appreciation of both natural and human environments.
