    "main_text": "\n\nQuestions about the existence and nature of mental causation are\nprominent in contemporary discussions of the mind and human agency.\nOriginally, the problem of mental causation was that of understanding\nhow an immaterial mind, a soul, could interact with the body. Most\nphilosophers nowadays repudiate souls, but the problem of mental\ncausation has not gone away. Instead, focus has shifted to mental\nproperties. How could mental properties be causally relevant to bodily\nbehavior? How could something mental be a cause qua mental?\nAfter looking at the traditional Problem of Interaction, we survey\nseveral versions of the property-based problem along with potential\nsolutions.\n",
