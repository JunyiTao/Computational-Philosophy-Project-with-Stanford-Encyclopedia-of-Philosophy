    "main_text": "Adjacent Concepts || Fetishism\n2.2 Fetishism\n\nThe first of these adjacent ideas is fetishism.\n\u2018Fetishism\u2019 refers here to the idea of human creations\nwhich have somehow escaped (we might say that they have\ninappropriately separated out from) human control, achieved the\nappearance of independence, and come to enslave or dominate their\ncreators.\n\nWithin Hegelian and Marxist traditions, a surprisingly wide range of\nsocial phenomena\u2014including religion, the state, and private\nproperty\u2014have been characterised as having the character of a\nfetish. Indeed, Marx sometimes treats the phenomenon of fetishism as a\ndistinguishing feature of modernity; where previous historical epochs\nwere characterised by the rule of persons over persons, capitalist\nsociety is characterised by the rule of things over persons.\n\u2018Capital\u2019, we might say, has come to replace the feudal\nlord. Consider, for instance, the frequency with which \u2018market\nforces\u2019 are understood and represented within modern culture as\nsomething outside of human control, as akin to natural forces which\ndecide our fate. In a famous image\u2014from the Communist\nManifesto\u2014Marx portrays modern bourgeois society as\n\u2018like the sorcerer, who is no longer able to control the powers\nof the nether world whom he has called up by his spells\u2019 (Marx\nand Engels 1976: 489).\n\nIn order to elaborate this idea of fetishism, consider the example of\nChristian religious consciousness, as broadly understood in the\nwritings of Ludwig Feuerbach (1804\u20131872). (Feuerbach was a\ncontemporary of, and important influence on, the young Marx, amongst\nothers.) The famous, and disarmingly simple, conclusion of\nFeuerbach\u2019s philosophical analysis of religious consciousness is\nthat, in Christianity, individuals are worshipping the predicates of\nhuman nature, freed of their individual limitations and projected onto\nan ideal entity. For Feuerbach, however, this is no purely\nintellectual error, but is rather ripe with social, political, and\npsychological consequences, as this \u2018deity\u2019 now comes to\nenslave and dominate us. Not least, the Christian God demands real\nworld sacrifices from individuals, typically in the form of a denial\nor repression of their essential human needs. For instance, the\nChristian idea of marriage is portrayed as operating in a way that\nrepresses and punishes, rather than hallows and satisfies, the flesh\nof humankind (Leopold 2007: 207\u2013210).\n\nReligious consciousness, on this Feuerbachian account, looks to be a\ncase where alienation takes the form of fetishism. That is, there is\nboth a problematic separation here between subject and object\n(individuals and their own human nature), and it takes the form of a\nhuman creation (the idea of the species embodied in God) escaping our\ncontrol, achieving the appearance of independence, and coming to\nenslave and dominate us. The same looks to be true, on\nMarx\u2019s account, of production in contemporary capitalist\nsocieties. Capital takes on the appearance of an independent social\npower which determines what is produced, how it is produced, and the\neconomic (and other) relations between producers. Marx himself was\nstruck by the parallel, and in the first volume of Capital,\noffers the following analogy: \u2018As, in religion, man is governed\nby the products of his own brain, so in capitalistic production, he is\ngoverned by the products of his own hand\u2019 (Marx 1996: 616).\nHowever, rather than equating alienation and fetishism, fetishism is\nbetter thought of as a particular form that alienation might take. (To\nbe clear, there looks to be no reason to think that Marx would, or\nshould, disagree with this claim.)\n\nNote, in particular, that although Marx\u2019s discussions of\nalienation often utilise the language of fetishism, not all of them\ntake that form. Consider, for instance, the problematic separation\nsometimes said to exist between modern individuals and the natural\nworld, as the former think of themselves and behave as if they were\nisolated, or cut off, or estranged, from the latter. The idea here is\nreflected in the less \u2018Promethean\u2019 moments of Marx\u2019s\nwork, for example, in the suggestion that the appropriate relation\nbetween humankind and nature would involve not our instrumental\ndomination of \u2018the other\u2019, but rather a sympathetic\nappreciation of our complex interdependence with the natural world of\nwhich we are, in reality, a part. Those moments are perhaps most\nevident in Marx\u2019s discussion of contemporary\n\u2018ecological\u2019 threats\u2014including deforestation,\npollution, and population growth\u2014and typically involve his\n\u2018metabolic\u2019 account of the appropriate relation between\nhumankind and nature (Foster 1999). The inappropriate modern relation\nbetween humankind and nature here looks like an example of\nalienation\u2014there is a problematic separation of self and\nother\u2014but certain central characteristics of fetishism would\nappear to be absent. Most obviously, the natural world is not a human\ncreation which has escaped our control; not least, because\nnature is not a human creation. Moreover, the impact on humankind\nof this particular separation does not comfortably suit the language\nof enslavement and domination. Indeed, if anything, our inappropriate\nseparation from the natural world seems to find expression in our own\nruthlessly instrumental treatment of nature, rather than in\nnature\u2019s tyranny over us.\n",
