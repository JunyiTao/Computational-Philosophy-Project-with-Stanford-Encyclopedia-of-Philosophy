    "main_text": "Neo-Pyrrhonism\n4. Neo-Pyrrhonism\n\nIt is now time to present in some detail Porchat\u2019s\nneo-Pyrrhonism, for it is arguably the most important contribution to\nLatin American skepticism. His seminal paper, \u201cOn What\nAppears\u201d, was published in 1991, laying the foundations and the\noutline of his skeptical stance. Later, in a number of papers, he\nexplored the main ideas further, corrected minor points, developed new\naspects, and wrote some introductory and accessible texts.\n\nOne of the merits of Porchat\u2019s neo-Pyrrhonism is that it\nprovides a general, articulated philosophical stance that one can\nadopt. Skepticism is not, as it is usually presented in\nepistemological circles, a mere doubt on this or that topic that\nshould be superseded, that is, it is not a methodological doubt or an\nexpedient to strengthen a dogmatic position. For most philosophers\nconcerned with skepticism, the coherence and intelligibility of the\nskeptical position is not really important. Any doubt, however crazy, may be useful, if it allows the philosopher to learn something about\nan argument. But Porchat does not think so. For him, skepticism is\nthought of as an articulated, plausible stance proposed by some\nphilosophers. Porchat\u2019s neo-Pyrrhonism is not even confined to a\nbroad epistemological doctrine, since it is meant to be a general\nphilosophical attitude, which includes epistemological aspects, but is\nnot restricted to them.\n\nOne should also emphasize that his neo-Pyrrhonism has to be sharply\ndistinguished from Cartesian skepticism. Porchat makes it clear that\nneo-Pyrrhonian aporiai are a different sort of argument from\nCartesian doubts. In particular, neo-Pyrrhonism is not committed to\nmentalism (the doctrine that one can conceive the mind, and its\nrepresentations, as independent from the body) and does not it invite\nany sort of solipsism. Thus, most of the criticisms leveled against\nCartesian skepticism do not apply to neo-Pyrrhonism.\n\nNeo-Pyrrhonism has two parts: one negative, and the other positive.\nThe two most important concepts of the negative part are\ndiaphon\u00eda (the conflict among the various\nphilosophical doctrines) and epokh\u00e9 (the suspension of\njudgment). For Porchat, atarax\u00eda, or tranquility of\nmind, is not an essential ingredient of Pyrrhonism and it is more of\nhistorical interest. Given the conflict of philosophies, Porchat draws\nthe skeptical conclusion: being genuinely unable to choose between the\nvarious philosophical views, he suspends his judgment. He argues\nvigorously that the disagreement between philosophies is undecidable.\nNot even his previous \u201cphilosophy of the common view of the\nworld\u201d (Porchat 1975, 1979) is able to solve or avoid the\nconflict. The conflict involves the dogmatism not only of philosophers\nof the common view of the world, but also of ordinary people. However,\nnot all philosophies are part of the conflict, since some philosophies\nare not dogmatic: they do not intend to describe the ultimate nature\nof things.\n\nPorchat (1993) distinguishes between two kinds of skeptical arguments:\ndialectical and empirical. This is a significant contribution of\nPorchat\u2019s neo-Pyrrhonism to skepticism. Let us consider, first,\ndialectical arguments. The mode of diaphon\u00eda, in\nPorchat\u2019s neo-Pyrrhonism, is the crucial one. But, of course,\nPorchat also considers the other modes of Agrippa as important\nskeptical weapons against dogmatism. More importantly, he recognizes\nthat for ancient Pyrrhonism the skeptical method of antinomies\n(arguing both pro and con with equal persuasiveness) is indispensable\nagainst the dogmatic claim that some doctrines and arguments are\nfelt stronger than others. That is, the method is\nindispensable to neutralize that dogmatic experience of unbalanced\narguments, by making stronger the weaker arguments. By arguing on both\nsides of an issue, the skeptic experiences them as being equally\nstrong. Why do they seem equally powerful in the skeptic\u2019s\nintellectual experience? For the following reason: any criterion\nproposed to decide the issue will itself be part of the dispute, and\ndisagreement about it re-emerges. Skeptics do not commit themselves to\nthese dialectical arguments. They just use what dogmatists admit\nagainst dogmatism. Their whole point is to induce suspension of\njudgment in dogmatists while still maintaining their own\nepokh\u00e9.\n\nThere is, however, another route toward suspension of judgment.\nSkeptics can employ arguments they are able to endorse, which lead to\nthe conclusion that one ought to suspend judgment. As skeptics\n(Pyrrhonists) live their ordinary life like everyone else, they can\nalso reason like everyone else. They can search for the conjunction of\nphenomena in the world, establish empirical correlations, and infer\nthe presence of fire from the fact of smoke or the occurrence of a\nwound from the presence of a scar. Empirical reasoning leads us from\none phenomenon to another. Couldn\u2019t it be the case that such\nempirical arguments lead to suspension of judgment? These arguments\nhave as premises what is apparent, and they do not indicate a\nconclusion beyond the phenomena, since epokh\u00e9, their\nconclusion, is an intellectual experience. According to Porchat\n(1993), Aenesidemus\u2019 modes are empirical, not dialectical,\narguments in support of epokh\u00e9.\n\nWith regard to the positive part, neo-Pyrrhonism presents a detailed\naccount of the crucial notion of phain\u00f3menon. Porchat\nthought, in an earlier phase, that phain\u00f3menon was to\nbe identified with, or assimilated to, phantas\u00eda\n(Porchat 1985, 1986). That explains why he once construed that notion\nas implying some form of mentalism: what appears was conceived of as a\nmental representation. He later rejected that identification (Porchat\n1991). On his new explanation, phain\u00f3menon is best\naccounted for by another crucial notion: b\u00edos, or\ncommon life. After all, says Sextus Empiricus, what appears is\nb\u00edos. Thus, Sextus\u2019 explanation of the skeptical\nstandard of action is also an explanation of the notion of\nphain\u00f3menon. By paying close attention to the fourfold\neveryday observances, one may understand better what the\nphain\u00f3menon is. At the same time, common life is to be\nunderstood as what is apparent (what appears to those who live it),\nnot as a reality in itself.\n\nAccording to Porchat, phenomena are a kind of residue from suspension\nof judgment; they are what is left after we have suspended judgment\nabout dogmatic discourse. And once dogmatism is left behind, life is\nwhat is left for us. The phenomena impose themselves to us, and it is\nnot up to us to accept them or not. One could say that phenomenon is\nwhat is \u201cgiven\u201d to us, but that is misleading, for in one\nsense it is not \u201cgiven\u201d at all. At first, Porchat asserted\nthat language is a kind of constitutive ingredient of the phenomena\nand language permeates all our experience (Porchat 1991); later,\nperhaps to avoid some Kantian or idealist connotation, he preferred to\ntalk of an association between what appears and language (Porchat\n1995, 2013). Thus, phenomena are impregnated by language, not given to\nus.\n\nOne important comment Porchat makes concerning phenomena is that they\nare always relative to someone. In fact, they may be personal or\npublic. Something may appear to someone or to more than one person,\nmaybe even to all of us. For instance, it may appear to you right now\nthat your are reading this article; and it may appear to many of us\nthat Brasilia is the capital of Brazil; and it may appear to all of us\nthat there are trees in the world. Here it can be noted that there is\nno solipsistic tendency in neo-Pyrrhonism, since many people in fact\nshare most phenomena. That solipsism is not an inherent tendency in\nneo-Pyrrhonism can already be seen due to the connections between the\nphenomena and common life. After all, what is apparent to us are\nobjects and events in the world, part of the life all of us live.\n\nAnother remark is that phenomena are sensible or intellectual. When\nsomething appears to the senses, such as the perception of a table in\nfront of you, it is a sensible phenomenon; when it appears to the\nintellect, such as a law, it is an intellectual phenomenon. For\nPorchat, there is no sharp line between these two kinds of phenomena.\nA sensible phenomenon also has some intellectual aspect: when you see\na table in front of you, the very idea of a table includes in it\nsomething that goes beyond what is present in your sensory modalities.\nHowever, although Porchat does not develop this idea explicitly, most\nintellectual phenomena seem to have a reference to something sensible,\nor at least to have something sensible in its origin. Therefore, many\nphenomena are typically of one kind, always including both a sensible\nand an intellectual aspect in them. Very recently, however, Porchat\ndropped that doctrine, and he now prefers to distinguish between two\nkinds of phenomena (Porchat 2013).\n\nPorchat\u2019s interpretation of Pyrrhonism seems closer to\nFrede\u2019s (1997) than to Burnyeat\u2019s (1980). It seems that,\nfor him just like for Frede, skeptics have many beliefs in ordinary\nlife, but are not committed to philosophical beliefs (beliefs about\nthe truth of various philosophical views about the world). His\nneo-Pyrrhonism, therefore, would seem to be an urbane form of\nskepticism (cf. Barnes 1992). However, the very distinction at the\nbasis of that dispute between Frede and Burnyeat presupposes what\nPorchat rejects: a contrast between philosophers and ordinary people.\nFrom a neo-Pyrrhonist point of view, both are typically, though not\nalways, dogmatists: most philosophers are dogmatists and so are\nordinary folk; dogmatic philosophers only tend to be more refined in\nsome of their conceptions.\n\nThe crucial distinction is that between dogmatism and non-dogmatism.\nSometimes, ordinary people are not dogmatic, and neither are some\nphilosophers, such the skeptics (Pyrrhonists). For Porchat, many\ncontemporary philosophers are skeptics or have a skeptical tendency\nwithout knowing it (Porchat 2001). Thus, what matters for a\nneo-Pyrrhonist is not whether the skeptic has no beliefs whatsoever or\nonly ordinary beliefs, but whether he has dogmatic beliefs (concerning\n\u00e1dela) or non-dogmatic beliefs (concerning what\nappears, that is, the world or b\u00edos). Frede would have\nmissed the point concerning the scope of epokh\u00e9 for\nnot having understood properly the notion of\nphain\u00f3menon (Porchat 1991).\n\nAccordingly, the basic neo-Pyrrhonian distinction is that between the\nphenomena and what is said about the phenomena. Dogmatic discourse is\nabout the phenomena. When dogmatists say \u201croses are\nred\u201d they mean \u201croses are really red\u201d, and\nthey have a theory to explain what that alleged reality consists in.\nThus, they are no longer talking about the world, but about a further\nreality posited by their theory. No one disputes whether a rose\nappears red, but whether it is in fact red. Not all discourse,\nhowever, is about the phenomena and some merely expresses the\nphenomena. Such is ordinary language in daily life, and such is also\nthe use of language by neo-Pyrrhonists: they use language to express\nwhat appears to them (or to us, if the phenomenon is a common one),\nbut not to state how things really are. In this sense, \u201croses\nare red\u201d expresses how roses appear to us; and in this sense,\nneo-Pyrrhonists may even say it is true that roses are red\nand that we know it. Therefore, neo-Pyrrhonism is not, in one\nsense of the word, a form of relativism, since it accepts an objective\nknowledge about the world.\n\nTwo other Pyrrhonian concepts are updated by the neo-Pyrrhonist in the\npositive part: ha\u00edresis and z\u00e9tesis.\nAccording to Porchat, neo-Pyrrhonists have a doctrine or \u201ca\nskeptical view of the world\u201d. This skeptical view of the world\nis an elaboration of how things appear to neo-Pyrrhonists. Skeptical\ndiscourse should be understood as an expression of phenomena. Thus,\nneo-Pyrrhonists may articulate explicitly their own view of the world.\nSince most phenomena are common, especially those that concern\nphilosophical issues, neo-Pyrrhonists will try to make explicit our\nways of thinking, at least as they see them. However, each skeptic\nwill have his or her own skeptical view of the world, since this view\ndepends also on the circumstances in which they live.\n\nLastly, it should be noted that neo-Pyrrhonists are empiricists, but\ntheir empiricism is improved by current philosophy of science. For\ninstance, they may endorse the hypothetic-deductive method. For them,\nwe can explore the world empirically, and in their skeptical view of\nthe world they may incorporate scientific results. For instance, we\nthink that the earth moves, and we no longer think that the earth is\nat the center of the universe. Scientific results may and do have\nimportant impacts on our view of the world, including on the\nneo-Pyrrhonists\u2019. Porchat went as far as to distinguish between\na philosophical realism and a scientific realism (Porchat 1991, 1994),\nasserting that neo-Pyrrhonists need not be instrumentalists, but could\nhold scientific realism, although not, of course, philosophical\nrealism. If there is objective knowledge of the common world, it seems\nthat the sciences can improve on that knowledge being guided by an\nexperimental method such as the hypothetic-deductive. Neo-Pyrrhonian\nz\u00e9tesis is not only a philosophical inquiry to destroy\ndogmatism, as in the case of Sextus, but also an empirical exploration\nof the world of phenomena.\n",
