    "main_text": "Boltzmannian Statistical Mechanics (BSM) || The Ergodic Approach\n4.4 The Ergodic Approach\n\nA classical explanation of the approach to equilibrium is given within\nergodic theory. A system is ergodic iff, in the long run (i.e., in the\nlimit of time \\(t \\rightarrow \\infty\\)), for almost all initial\nconditions it is the case that the fraction of time that the\nsystem\u2019s trajectory spends in a region \\(R\\) of \\(X\\) is equal\nto the fraction that \\(R\\) occupies in \\(X\\) (Arnold & Avez 1967\n[1968]). For instance, if \\(\\mu(R)/\\mu(X) = 1/3,\\) then an ergodic\nsystem will, in the long run, spend 1/3 of its time in \\(R\\) (for a\nmore extensive discussion of ergodicity see entry on\n the ergodic hierarchy).\n\nIn\n Section 4.2\n we have seen that if the equilibrium macro-region is constructed with\nthe combinatorial argument, then it occupies the largest portion of\n\\(X\\). If we now also assume that the system is ergodic, it follows\nimmediately that the system spends\u00a0the largest portion of time in\nequilibrium. This is then often given a probabilistic gloss by\nassociating the time that a system spends in a certain part of \\(X\\)\nwith the probability of finding the system in that part of \\(X\\), and\nso we get that we are overwhelmingly likely to find that system in\nequilibrium; for a discussion of this approach to probabilities see\nFrigg (2010) and references therein.\n\nThe ergodic approach faces a number of problems. First, being ergodic\nis a stringent condition that many systems fail to meet. This is a\nproblem because among those systems are many to which SM is\nsuccessfully applied. For instance, in a solid the molecules oscillate\naround fixed positions in a lattice, and as a result the phase point\nof the system can only access a small part of the energy hypersurface\n(Uffink 2007: 1017). The Kac Ring model and a system of anharmonic\noscillators behave thermodynamically but fail to be ergodic (Bricmont\n2001). And even the ideal gas\u2014supposedly the paradigm system of\nSM\u2014is not ergodic (Uffink 1996b: 381). But if core-systems of SM\nare not ergodic, then ergodicity cannot provide an explanation for the\napproach to equilibrium, at least not one that is applicable across\nthe board (Earman & R\u00e9dei 1996; van Lith 2001). Attempts\nhave been made to improve the situation through the notion of\nepsilon-ergodicity, where a system is epsilon-ergodic if it is ergodic\nonly on subset \\(Y \\subset X\\) where \\(\\mu(Y) \\geq 1 - \\varepsilon\\),\nfor small positive real number \\(\\varepsilon\\) (Vranas 1998). While\nthis approach deals successfully with some systems (Frigg & Werndl\n2011), it is still not universally applicable and hence remains silent\nabout large classes of SM systems.\n\nThe ergodic approach accommodates Loschmidt\u2019s and\nZermelo\u2019s objections by rejecting the requirement of strict\nirreversibility. The approach insists that systems, can, and actually\ndo, move away from equilibrium. What SM should explain is not strict\nirreversibility, but the fact that systems spend most of the time in\nequilibrium. The ergodic approach does this by construction, and only\nallows for brief and infrequent episodes of non-thermodynamic\nbehaviour (when the system moves out of equilibrium). This response is\nin line with Callender (2001) who argues that we should not take\nthermodynamics \u201ctoo seriously\u201d and see its strictly\nirreversible approach to equilibrium as an idealisation that is not\nempirically accurate because physical systems turn out to exhibit\nequilibrium fluctuations.\n\nA more technical worry is what is known as the measure zero\nproblem. As we have seen, ergodicity says that \u201calmost all\ninitial conditions\u201d are such that the fraction of time spent in\n\\(R\\) is equal to the fraction \\(R\\) occupies in \\(X\\). In technical\nterms this means that set of initial conditions for which this is not\nthe case has measure zero (with respect to \\(\\mu\\)). Intuitively this\nwould seem to suggest that these conditions are negligible. However,\nas Sklar (1993: 182\u201388) points out, sets of measure zero can be\nrather large (remember that set of rational numbers has measure zero\nin the real numbers), and the problem is to justify why a set of\nmeasure zero really is negligible.\n",
