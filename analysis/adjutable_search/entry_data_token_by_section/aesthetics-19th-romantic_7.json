    "main_text": "Aesthetics, Epistemology and Metaphysics || Concrete Individuality\n3.4 Concrete Individuality\n\nLike Spinoza\u2019s God and Kant\u2019s omnitudo realitatis\n(All of Reality), the Absolute is an all-encompassing\nindividual: while it comprehends everything else, the\nAbsolute is also concrete. It is an individual whole\u2014a totality,\nthe parts of which could be understood only negatively, as its\nlimitations. To approximate the Absolute, then, we need a mode of\nconsciousness that is particularly suited to discern a holistic unity\nin an individual. While\n \u00a75.3\n discusses what is required in order to apprehend holistic unities,\nand the holistic unities of artworks and natural beauties, this\nsection focuses on the individual character of artworks and natural\nbeauties.\n\nOn the romantic picture, an artwork that does not present itself as a\n\u201cliving individual\u201d (Novalis, Po\u00ebsie, NS 2:\n534, #35) is not worthy of the title of a work of art, and the one who\ndoes not approach artworks as unique individuals is not a genuine\naesthetic critic: \u201cWhoever conceives of poetry or philosophy as\nindividuals has a feeling for them\u201d (F. Schlegel, AF: #415). The\naesthetic approach to beauty, then, is an approach to those things\nthat are irreducibly individuals, those that should not be approached\nmerely as ones of many\u2014as instances of general kinds\u2014but\nas concrete individuals: \u201cEverything that is to be criticized\nmust be an individual\u201d (F. Schlegel, FLP: #634).And\nthis is the very approach that is required in the pursuit of the\nAbsolute given its individual nature.\n",
