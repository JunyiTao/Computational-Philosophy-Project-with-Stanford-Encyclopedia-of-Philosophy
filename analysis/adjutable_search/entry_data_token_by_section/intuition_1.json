    "main_text": "The Nature of Intuitions || Intuitions as Beliefs\n1.1 Intuitions as Beliefs\n\nSome philosophers equate intuitions with beliefs or with some kind of\nbelief. For example, David Lewis writes,\n\n\nOur \u201cintuitions\u201d are simply opinions; our philosophical\ntheories are the same. Some are commonsensical, some are\nsophisticated; some are particular, some general; some are more firmly\nheld, some less. But they are all opinions\u2026. (1983: x)\n\n\nSuch remarks suggest the following account:\n\n[A1]  S has the\nintuition that p if and only if S believes that\np.\n\n\nWhy adopt [A1]? Some may be moved to do so on grounds of ontological\nparsimony. If intuitions are beliefs, we need accept no new kind\npsychological state. Furthermore, there is clearly a tight link\nbetween intuitions and beliefs in that one typically believes the\ncontents of one\u2019s intuitions.\n\nHowever, that belief that p is neither necessary nor sufficient\nfor intuition that p is suggested by conflicts between a\nperson\u2019s beliefs and their intuitions. One plausible\ncharacterization of a paradox holds that it is a set of a\npropositions, each of which is intuitive, but not all of which could\nbe true. If one has reasoned one\u2019s way to a satisfactory\nresolution of a paradox and identified the false proposition, one\noften still has the intuition that the rejected proposition is true.\nHence, supposing that in such a case one\u2019s beliefs are not\ncontradictory, one can have an intuition that p while one does\nnot believe p and one can have a belief that p without\nhaving an intuition that p. Indeed, even before such reasoning,\none might suspend belief about the contradictory set while each\nremained intuitive. More generally, it seems that one may believe\nsomething\u2014that some theory is true, that some mathematical or\nlogical proposition is a theorem, that one is hungry, or that a person\nis now speaking\u2014without having any intuition that p and\nso belief that p is not sufficient for intuition that\np.\n\nSuch cases also illustrate an important feature of\nintuitions\u2014their relative causal independence from explicit\nbelief. An analogy with perception is helpful. One might, when viewing\nthe M\u00fcller-Lyer illusion, experience one line as longer than the\nother even though one, having repeatedly measured the lines, firmly\nbelieves them to be of equal length. Just such an analogy is invoked\nwhen, for example, it is suggested that some moral intuitions may\nbe\n\n\nineliminable moral illusion[s], similar to certain optical illusions\nwhich do not lose their intuitive appeal even when theory tells us\nbetter. (Kagan 1989: 15)\n\n\nA more discriminating version of this sort of account holds that\nintuitions are beliefs with a suitable etiology. One such\naccount, favored by many psychologists and philosophers with\nnaturalistic inclinations, treats intuitions as beliefs without a\nconscious or introspectively accessible inferential etiology (Gopnik\nand Schwitzgebel 1998; Devitt 2006: 491; Kornblith 1998) as in\n\n[A2] S has the\nintuition that p if and only if S forms the occurrent\nbelief that p without consciously inferring it from some other\nbelief.\n\n\nOn [A2], beliefs with an inferential origin of which a person is\nconscious are not intuitions. However, [A2] still mistakenly includes\nnon-inferential perceptual beliefs, memory beliefs, and introspective\nbeliefs as intuitions. Moreover [A2], like [A1], runs afoul of the\nfact that one can have intuitions the contents of which one does not\nbelieve. The former problem might be circumvented by a content\nrestriction on the sort of non-inferential belief at issue or further\netiological restrictions. The latter problem does not appear so easily\ncircumvented.\n\nA yet more discriminating etiological amendment to the belief analysis\n(Ludwig 2007: 135) is\n\n[A3] S has the\nintuition that p if and only if S forms the occurrent\nbelief that p solely on the basis of competence with the\nconcepts involved in p.\n\n\nThis analysis is not open to many of the objections to [A1] and [A2].\nIt does not count an introspective, memory, or perceptual belief as an\nintuition. However, on the assumption that the concepts in question\nare not contradictory, it may imply (depending on what is required for\ncompetence with a concept) that intuitions are infallible. Even if\nintuitions are infallible, if S has mistakenly rejected one of\nthe propositions making up a paradox, p, it seems she might,\ncontrary to [A3], still have the intuition that p. Finally,\n[A3] appears to make the direct introspective judgment that one has an\nintuition difficult to justify, as one lacks direct introspective\naccess to the non-conscious causes of one\u2019s beliefs.\n",
