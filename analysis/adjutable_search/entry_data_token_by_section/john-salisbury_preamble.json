    "main_text": "\n\nJohn of Salisbury (1115/20\u20131180) was among the foremost\nphilosophers of the so-called twelfth century Renaissance,\ncontributing to the development of political and moral philosophy as\nwell as to the medieval theory of education and to the dissemination\nof emerging Aristotelian learning. Having received an extensive\neducation in Paris, he spent most of his life as an active servant of\nthe church. An associate of Archbishop Thomas Becket of Canterbury\nduring his dispute with King Henry II of England, John eventually was\nraised to the office of Bishop of Chartres. John\u2019s thought has\nbeen characterized as \u201chumanistic\u201d, since he valorizes the\ndignity of humanity and of nature generally: The latter is\nintelligible and may be understood through the application of natural\nreason. Yet John admitted that severe impediments exist to the\nattainment of wisdom. Throughout his writings, he professed to follow\nthe moderate skepticism of Cicero and the New Academy, which rejected\ndogmatic claims to certainty. The best that rational human inquiry may\nin most matters achieve, John says, is probable truth, always subject\nto re-evaluation and revision. The general tenor of his philosophy is\nreflected in his advocacy of moderation and his emphasis on nature as\na normative guide to earthly fulfillment. John composed several\ntreatises of philosophical interest, most notably the\nPolicraticus (PC), but also the Metalogicon (ML) and\nthe Entheticus de dogmate philosophorum (EMM). These works\nwere all completed between 1154 and 1159, during the period of\nJohn\u2019s service to Archbishop Theobald, Becket\u2019s\npredecessor at the see of Canterbury. John\u2019s other\nwritings\u2014two letter collections, two hagiographies, and a\nhistory\u2014evince the practical application of his philosophical\ncommitments.\n",
