    "main_text": "Non-Transactional Theories || Constitutive Obligations\n5.3 Constitutive Obligations\n\nA third type of non-transactional view challenges the very idea that a\njustification for political obligation is needed. For example, Thomas\nMcPherson writes\n\n\n[W]hy should I obey the government is an absurd question. We have not\nunderstood what it means to be a member of political society\nif we suppose that political obligation is something we might not have\nhad and that therefore needs to be justified. (McPherson\n1967: 64)\n\n\nOn this view, the many attempts to find independent moral principles\nto justify obligation are not merely mistaken, they are conceptually\nconfused; they exhibit a \u201csymptom of philosophical\ndisorder\u201d (Pitkin 1965 [1972: 75]). The question of political\nobligation should be addressed instead by attending to the meaning of\n\u201cmember\u201d.\n\nIt is hard to find philosophers who still think that normative\nquestions can be resolved by linguistic considerations, but a more\nsophisticated version of this strategy has been recently advanced by\nMargaret Gilbert (2006), relying on the idea that members of political\ncommunities are jointly committed to uphold its institutions, and\nthereby obligated to play their part in executing this joint\ncommitment. (Notice, however, that for Gilbert, these obligations are\nnot moral in nature and thus her view is, in this important respect,\nvery different from all the other views we are considering.)\n\nA more influential version of the constitutive argument appeals to the\nvalue of associative obligations. Here the starting point is the\nobservation that we often find ourselves involved in relationships and\npractices that come with special responsibilities attached to them.\nEven when we have not chosen to be part of them, it\u2019s our very\nmembership in them that brings with it distinctive \u201crole\nobligations\u201d (Hardimon 1994). Failing to realize this fact is\nfailing to correctly interpret the responsibilities and practices in\nquestion (Dworkin 1986: 198). It\u2019s in this sense that Ronald\nDworkin claims that\n\n\n[p]olitical association, like family or friendship and other forms of\nassociation more local and intimate, is itself pregnant of obligation.\n(Dworkin 1986: 206)\n\n\nWe can make sense of these valuable practices and relationships only\nif we correctly understand the role that the obligations associated\nwith them are meant to play. Indeed, some go further and argue that\ngiven that these roles are typically crucial components of our own\nidentity, correctly understanding the obligations in question is\nnecessary to avoid being alienated from ourselves (Horton 2010; Tamir\n1995). The social preconditions of our identity are partly constituted\nby these obligations, so making sense of them is required to\nultimately make sense of who we are. By making sense of these\nobligations, we ultimately make sense of ourselves.\n\nSome have resisted this move by pointing out that while people in\norganic associations do often feel obligations to other members, we\nnormally seek an independent ground to justify them (see Simmons 1996;\nWellman 1997). After all, it\u2019s hardly surprising that members\nwho have been socialized within a certain practice will feel that\ntheir identity is shaped in important ways by the responsibilities\nassociated with it. The worry is that, absent a justification for this\ntreatment, these feelings are merely an instance of false\nconsciousness. It\u2019s worth noticing, however, that whilst this\nmight be an objection for communitarian versions of the theory (Horton\n2010), it is not an objection against Dworkin\u2019s formulation of\nthe associative view. Dworkin does believe that we have\n\n\na duty to honour our responsibilities under social practices that\ndefine groups and attach special responsibilities to membership.\n(Dworkin 1986: 198)\n\n\nprovided the group\u2019s members think that their obligations are\nspecial, personal, and derive from a good faith interpretation of\nequal concern for the well-being of all its members. But for him these\nconditions are not a matter of the members\u2019 actual feelings and\nthoughts. Rather, they are interpretive properties that we would do\nwell to impute to the members. Even so, why think that they ground a\nduty of obedience, as opposed to a duty of respectful attention, or a\nduty to apologize for cases of non-compliance? Certainly obedience is\nnot part of Dworkin\u2019s paradigm virtue of\n\u201cfraternity\u201d\u2014mutual aid and support are the normal\nobligations there. Indeed, the classical associative model for\npolitical authority was not fraternity, but paternity,\nagainst which Locke argued so decisively. This is not to deny that we\nowe something to those decent associations of which we find ourselves\nnon-voluntary members\u2014but this doesn\u2019t seem enough to\nvindicate political obligation (on Dworkin\u2019s view, see Perry\n2008).\n\nA second objection to the associative model consists in pointing out\nthat even if we concede that the model can justify obligations that\nare owed to members of small groups, which are structured around close\npersonal interactions, this is not yet to say that it can do the same\nwith obligations that are owed members of large groups, such as our\npolitical communities, most of whom we never have a chance to meet or\ninteract with (Simmons 2001: Chapter 4; but see Horton 2010 and\nGilbert 2006). It\u2019s unclear, however, how forceful this\nobligation is. Suppose that I\u2019ve been unable to interact with my\nparents or my siblings for most\u2014or even all\u2014of my life,\nfor reasons that none of us could control. Does that mean that my\nspecial obligations to them are automatically cancelled? Perhaps,\nunder certain circumstances, but not necessarily.\n\nA more promising objection targets the idea that associative\nobligations are non-voluntary. This is certainly true if by\n\u201cnon-voluntary\u201d we mean that we don\u2019t necessarily\nchoose to enter the relationships and the practices that are meant to\ngenerate the obligations. While it might be unclear whether we can\nchoose to become friend with someone (as opposed to our friendship\nforming spontaneously), we normally don\u2019t choose to enter our\nfamily. Still, it is possible for parents to disown their children and\nfor children to deny their parents, under certain conditions. When the\nattitudes of reciprocal trust and affection that are meant to support\nthese relationships disappear, the accompanying obligations are\nsignificantly weakened, and possibly extinguished. This has led some\nto argue that associative responsibilities are best understood as\n\u201cquasi-voluntarist\u201d. Although they are not premised on a\nchoice to enter the relationship with which they are associated, they\nare conditional on the relationship being endorsed, if only in the\nminimal sense that we could have stepped out of it, had we wished to\n(Renzo 2012; but see Dagger 2018: 79\u201382). But once we go down\nthis road, we are faced, once again, with the worry afflicting\nvoluntaristic accounts, such as those that appeal to consent or\nfairness. If endorsing our membership in the political community is a\ncondition for having the role obligations associated with such\nmembership, then anyone who fails to do so lacks political\nobligation.\n",
