    "main_text": "\n\nPropositional logic is the study of the meanings of, and the\ninferential relationships that hold among, sentences based on the role\nthat a specific class of logical operators called the propositional\nconnectives have in determining those sentences\u2019 truth or\nassertability conditions. As early as Aristotle it was observed that\npropositional connectives have a logical significance, and over many\ncenturies piecemeal observations about some of their properties were\nmade. But propositional logic per se did not emerge until the\nnineteenth century with the appreciation of the value of studying the\nbehavior of propositional connectives in isolation of other\noperators.\n\nFor example, a variation of the famous canonical syllogism where A is\nthe sentence \u201cAll men are mortal, and Socrates is a man\u201d,\nand B is the sentence \u201cSocrates is mortal\u201d can give rise\nto a plurality of questions about the relationship between A and B.\nWhether B follows logically from A ought not depend, it is thought, on\nwhat words like \u201cmortal\u201d or \u201cman\u201d mean. But\none could reasonably ask either of the questions, \n\n\nDoes B follow from A purely by virtue of the meaning of the words\n\u201cand\u201d, \u201cis\u201d, \u201care\u201d,\n\u201call\u201d, and \u201ca\u201d? \n\n\nand \n\n\nDoes B follow from A purely by virtue of the meaning of the word\n\u201cand\u201d? \n\n\nIntuitively, the answer to the first question is \u201cyes\u201d,\nand the answer to the second question is \u201cno\u201d.\n\nThe example suggests that there is a right way to ask the question,\nfor surely B does follow logically from A. So when we want to ask if a\nsentence follows logically, we should attend to the role of all words\nsuch as \u201cand\u201d, \u201cis\u201d, \u201care\u201d,\n\u201call\u201d, and \u201ca\u201d. Consider, however, if C is the\nsentence \u201cAll men are mortal\u201d and D is the sentence\n\u201cSocrates is a man\u201d, that C also follows from A, but the\nmeanings of the words \u201cis\u201d, \u201care\u201d,\n\u201call\u201d, and \u201ca\u201d play no role in the intuitive\nverification of that fact. (Because A is just the sentence \u201cC\nand D\u201d, nothing beyond an understanding of the meaning of the\nword \u201cand\u201d is needed to see that A cannot be true without\nC also being true.) It seems significant that B and C not only each\nfollow from A, but that they do so in different ways. The inference\nfrom A to C is not only simpler or more direct than the inference to\nB. In whatever sense B follows from A, so too does C, whereas there is\na stricter sense in which C, but not B, follows from A: Although both\nB and C follow \u201clogically\u201d from A, the logical bond\nbetween C and A is stronger than that between B and A. This highlights\nthe importance, not just of determinations about whether one sentence\nfollows from another, but of what standard of logicality underwrites\nthat determination.\n\nPropositional logic is the study of just such a specification of a\nstandard of logicality, wherein only the meanings of the propositional\nconnectives (e.g., \u201cand\u201d in the example above, but not\n\u201cis\u201d, \u201call\u201d, etc.) are considered in\nevaluating things such as the cogency of a deduction or a\nsentence\u2019s truth conditions.\n\nA sentential connective is a linguistic particle that binds sentences\nto create a new compound sentence or that inflects a single sentence\nto create a new sentence. Among the sentential connectives, a\npropositional connective has the characteristic feature that when the\noriginal sentences it operates on are (or express) propositions, the\nnew sentence that results from its application also is (or expresses)\na proposition. There are, as one would expect, many competing theories\nabout what a proposition is, and propositional logic originated as a\nscientific discipline independent of that debate. For this reason, the\nprecise demarcation of which linguistic particles qualify as\npropositional connectives is somewhat vague and even contentious. But\nthe general heuristic is that a propositional connective must create\nfrom some original sentences a new sentence that makes a claim of the\nsame order. Intuitively, because \u201cA and B\u201d is just an\naffirmation of the content of A and the content of B, and \u201cnot\nA\u201d is just a denial of the content of A, \u201cand\u201d and\n\u201cnot\u201d are serving as propositional connectives. \u201cIt\nis necessary that A\u201d, on the other hand, is a claim not about\nthe content of A but about the sentence A itself. Similarly, \u201cA\nimplies B\u201d is a claim about the sentences A and B, that they\nstand in an implication relationship with one another, rather than a\nclaim about the sort of thing that A and B themselves are claims\nabout. For this reason, the necessity qualifier and the implication\nrelation are typically not thought of as propositional connectives but\nas modal operators. The conditional operator in such expressions as\n\u201cIf A, then B\u201d has not received a consensus: On some\nanalyses, this has been treated as a propositional connective, but on\nothers it cannot be.\n\nIn presenting propositional logic, we will not assume any particular\ntheory of propositions. As we will see, the development of and\nplurality of systems of propositional logic can only be appreciated\nwhen no particular conception of proposition is in place. The only\nstipulations are that the connectives operate always on whole\nsentences and never on sub-sentential items like predicates or terms,\nand that they create sentences in the same evaluation class as the\nones they operate on, never higher-order expressions about the\nsentences in that class.\n",
