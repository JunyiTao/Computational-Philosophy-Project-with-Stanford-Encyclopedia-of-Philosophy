Conclusion: Humboldt\u2019s Influence\n\nHumboldt is perhaps the most famous scientist of the nineteenth\ncentury, and has been described as the second most famous person in\nEurope after Napoleon. His Kosmos-lectures drew thousands of\nBerliners, as well as international visitors, who had come especially\nto listen to Humboldt. These lectures were decisive for the\npopularization of science, as was Kosmos, the first volume of\nwhich (over 1000 pages long) sold out in two months and was translated\ninto almost every major language. But already earlier in the century\nHumboldt had become a household name, thanks to his political works,\nespecially his essay on Cuba, and the Relation Historique\n(Personal Narrative ), which had been a favorite by the likes\nof Charles Darwin and Russell Alfred Wallace. \n\nDarwin, who described Humboldt as \u201cthe greatest traveler who\never lived\u201d, boarded the Beagle in imitation of\nHumboldt\u2019s travels to South America, and wrote in his diary that\nit was Humboldt\u2019s Personal Narrative that he repeatedly\nread while on the Beagle (Sloan 2009). Wallace, in turn,\nwrote that among all the works he read, the one which most influenced\nhis future \u201cwere Humboldt\u2019s \u2018Personal Narrative of\nTravels in South America\u2019\u201d (Wallace 1905: vol. 1, 232).\nIndeed, Robert Richards has argued that the origins of the theory of\nevolution can be traced back to Humboldt and the German romantic\ntradition of which he was part (Richards 2002).\n\nHumboldt\u2019s synthesizing approach to\nscience\u2014\u201cHumboldtian Science\u201d\u2014was, as Susan\nCannon put it, \u201cthe great new thing in professional science in\nthe first half of the 19th century\u201d (Cannon 1978).\nHumboldtian scientists travelled across the world, founding botanical\ngardens or leading expeditions. In a speech commemorating Humboldt,\nFerdinand von M\u00fcller, founder of the Melbourne Botanical Gardens,\nexplains that for the Humboldtian scientist the most important goal is\nnot to perfect individual disciplines, but \n\n\nto explore the inner connections of the sciences, to discover their\nreciprocal relations, and thereby to extend the whole empire of\nknowledge simultaneously. (M\u00fcller 1859: 20)\n\n\nUS Congressman George Perkins Marsh read Humboldt\u2019s writings\nbefore the US Congress in 1847, to provide evidence of the negative\nimpact of human activity on the environment, and three years later, in\n1850, the US Commissioner of Patents Thomas Ewbank cited\nHumboldt\u2019s observations at Lake Valencia in support of the\ncampaign for national parks. Yellowstone National Park was established\nin 1872\u2014the first in the world\u2014though the campaign for\ndesignating it a national park had begun in the 1860s (Lindstrom 2011:\n836). In 1890 Yosemite became a national park, thanks to the efforts\nof John Muir, who was also influenced by Humboldt\u2014however, as\nAaron Sachs has noted, by the later stage of his life, Muir had moved\naway from his Humbolditan origins, in that he came to prioritize\nnature over the human cultures that inhabited it (Sachs 2004: 28; see\nalso Wulf 2015).\n\nHumboldt\u2019s descriptions of Latin and South American landscapes\nsupported the development of national identities independent of Spain.\nThe Mexican historian and politician Lucas Ignacio Alam\u00e1n y\nEscalada invited Humboldt to work with him to bring about an\nindependent Mexico and regarded Humboldt\u2019s Essai Politique\nsur le royaume de la Nouvelle-Espagne as furnishing a compelling\npresentation of a liberal Mexican constitution (Ortega y Medina 1960:\n25\u201326). Furthermore, and as Juan Ortega y Medina has argued,\nHumboldt\u2019s work encouraged Mexican mapmakers and geographers to\ndraw maps of an independent Mexico (Ortega y Medina 1960). In turn, it\nappears to have been after a meeting with Humboldt at a Paris salon in\n1804 that Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar was inspired to carry out an\nindependence movement in South America (Walls 2009: 17).\nBol\u00edvar led the Venezuelan revolution, and went on to lead\nrevolutions in Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia. \n\nMany artists, in particular visual artists, followed in\nHumboldt\u2019s footsteps, travelling to South American to depict\nvisually and with exactness the landscape that Humboldt described in\nhis writings. These include the American Frederic Edwin Church, a\nmember of the Hudson River school of art (Harvey 2020), and the\nGerman, Johann Moritz Rugendas. Rugendas met Humboldt in Paris in 1825\nand in 1830 travelled to Mexico with Humboldt\u2019s assistance\n(Bunkse 1981). This was followed by trips to Chile and Argentina.\nChurch, in turn, retraced Humboldt\u2019s footsteps in Ecuador and\nMexico (Baron 2005). Like Humboldt, Church and Rugendas\u2014among\nothers\u2014sought to combine precision with artistic feeling and\nthereby realize Humboldt\u2019s ideal in the visual arts.\n\nHumboldt\u2019s works and ideas were, however, also\ncensored\u2014and not only in Sidney Thrasher\u2019s translation of\nthe Cuba essay. Humboldt tried to travel to India on a number of\noccasions but was repeatedly denied permission on account of his\ncritique of colonialism (Grove 1995: 375). Furthermore, Americans who\nrespected Humboldt for his scientific works either ignored or\nintentionally misrepresented his social and political views. In a\nmeeting held in Boston to honor Humboldt, the Harvard anthropologist,\nLouis Aggasiz\u2014who had argued in his 1850 essay, \u201cThe\nDiversity of the Origin of the Human Race\u201d, that Africans are an\ninferior race\u2014provided an overview of Humboldt\u2019s ideas,\nbut failed to mention Humboldt\u2019s views on slavery. In a eulogy\nfollowing Humboldt\u2019s death, the American diplomat George\nBancroft falsely claimed that Humboldt was in favor of American\nexpansion into Cuba (Foner 1983). Nonetheless\u2014and in large part\nthanks to his open letter\u2014Humboldt became known as an\nabolitionist in the United States, and became an important voice\nsupporting the cause (Harvey 2020).\n\nWhile Humboldt\u2019s influence on philosophers has been less\nstudied, it is evident that he played a significant role in the\ndevelopment of American Transcendentalism. Emerson claims to have\nunderstood nature\u2019s \u201cunity in variety\u201d by reading\nHumboldt, while Thoreau began classifying New England\u2019s climate\nzones using Humboldt\u2019s model (Walls 1995;\nWorster 1977). Furthermore,\nHumboldt\u2019s use of analogy seems to have influenced Charles\nSanders Pierce\u2019s semiotics (Walls 2009).\n\nIn Germany, Humboldt inspired Goethe, Schelling, and even Hegel.\nGoethe describes Humboldt as \n\n\na fountain with many ducts, under which one need only hold a vessel\nand from which refreshing and inexhaustible streams are ever flowing.\n(MA 19: 168; dated 13 December 1826) \n\n\nImportantly, Goethe felt encouraged by Humboldt\u2019s interest in\nhis work. It was, for instance, following the Humboldt brothers\u2019\nvisit to Weimar 1795, during which Goethe had discussed his notion of\nthe animal \u201ctype [Typus]\u201d, that Goethe began to\nwrite down his ideas. As Goethe reflects on this moment years later,\nit was the Humboldt brothers\u2019 prodding that led him to pursue\nthe matter further (MA 12, 181).\n\nSchelling, in turn, saw in Humboldt the exemplary natural\nscientist\u2014not despite his empirical research, but because of it\n(Pinsdorf 2020). In fact, Schelling regarded Humboldt\u2019s research\nas providing empirical foundations for Naturphilosophie, and\nsaw him as playing a crucial spiritual role in European culture. As he\nput it in a letter to Humboldt composed soon after the latter\u2019s\nreturn to Europe, Humboldt\u2019s work will \u201crestore to the\nhuman spirit its ancient possession, nature\u201d (quoted in\nDettelbach 2001: 18). Hegel, though dismayed by Humboldt\u2019s\ncritical remarks on Naturphilosophie in his Kosmos lectures,\nsought to determine\u2014along Humboldtian lines\u2014the\n\u201cgeographic foundations of world history\u201d (Bond 2014).\n\nFurthermore, Humboldt paved new paths for the study and estimation of\nIndigenous American culture and language\u2014not only by helping his\nbrother acquire one of the largest collections of languages in Europe,\nincluding the Kawi language, but also by inspiring US Treasury\nSecretary, Albert Gallatin, to write his major work in American\nethnology, A Synopsis of the Indian Tribes within the United\nStates (1836) (Sachs 2004).\n\nAll in all, it is difficult to imagine the nineteenth century without\nHumboldt, and the scientific, artistic, and philosophical traditions\nthat he founded and supported.\n",
