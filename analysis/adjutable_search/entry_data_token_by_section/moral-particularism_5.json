The Generalists\u2019 Reply\n\n\nGeneralists have two possible replies to these attacks, assuming\nalways that they accept that many of the contributory principles that\nthey originally suggested have been refuted by counter-example. The\nfirst thing they can do is to complicate the principles. The second\nthing they can do is to restrict their generalism to a limited group\nof reasons.\n\n\nTaking the first tack, one might suggest that if the fact that one has\npromised is in some cases not a reason for doing what one promised to\ndo, there will be some explanation of this. Suppose that the\nexplanation is that what one promised to do was immoral. All one needs\nto do is to suck this feature into one\u2019s account of the supposedly\ngeneral reason. So now the reason in ordinary cases will be that one\npromised to do it and it is not immoral. We might object that not even\nthis is always a reason. What if one\u2019s promise has been extracted by\nduress? The response will be to suck that into the reason as\nwell. This reason is growing all the time; now it is that one promised\nto do it, that it is not itself immoral, and one\u2019s promise was not\nmade under duress. This battle can continue; it has no obvious\nstopping point.  Still, we might say, eventually ingenuity will give\nout, and we will reach a (now very complex) specification of a reason\nto which we can think of no appropriate counter-example.\n\n\nBut note what has happened here. We started from a consideration that\nwe took to count in favour of our action, and we have ended with a\ncomplex specification of something that plays rather a different role.\nWhat we got at the end was more like an elaborate guarantee that\nsomething mentioned in the guarantee counts in favour of the action.\nConsider the promising example above. That I promised does, let us\nsuppose, count in favour of my acting. But that my promise was not\nmade under duress does not do that at all. It functions as an\nenabling condition, one in whose absence the first feature\n(that I promised) would not have been the reason it is. It is not\nitself a reason to do the action; that role is distinctive, and it is\nplayed here only by the fact that I promised. Note, further, that the\ncombination of that reason and this enabling condition is not itself a\n(further) reason in favour of doing the action. So the distinction\nbetween \u2018counting in favour\u2019 and \u2018enabling something\nelse to count in favour\u2019 is significant, as particularists see\nthings. What the generalist reached, in defending her supposed reason\nby complication, is therefore not itself a reason at all, but only a\nguarantee (when finally complete) that there is a reason somewhere\nwithin it. And why should we suppose that nothing can be a reason\nunless we can specify a condition that guarantees its status as a\nreason, and that it is only a reason when present in a larger state\nwithin which it is guaranteed to serve as such? No obvious answer\nsuggests itself. The whole enterprise of defending one\u2019s reason by\ncomplication begins to look strangely irrelevant, and its product\nunnecessary. One would have thought that there can be reasons that can\nfunction perfectly well without this sort of guarantee. And the\nreasons given on behalf of generalism in \n Section 2 (above) \n do nothing to show otherwise.\n\n\nThe second generalist line of defence involves drawing in one\u2019s horns\na little. Ross distinguishes between derived and underived prima facie\nduties. The underived ones are the duty to do the just thing, to act\nfor the best, not to cause harm, to keep promises, and so on. Other\nduties are derived from these. So there is, as we might put it, a core\nof invariability surrounded by a variable periphery. I might have a\nduty to go up to London today to see my son Hugh. But this duty is\nderived from a general duty to do what I have promised to do. As we\nmight put it, that Hugh is expecting to see me today sometimes gives\nme a reason to go up to London and sometimes does not; it is a\nderived, and therefore variable, reason. If it does give me a reason,\nit will because it is keyed in some way into an unvariable, underived\nreason.  So derived reasons are variable, and underived ones\ninvariant. On this account, counter-examples will only do damage if\nthey are aimed at the supposed underived reasons. (See McNaughton and\nRawling 2000.)\n\n\nA different version of this picture maintains that invariant reasons\nderive from the virtues (Crisp 2000). That an action is generous,\nhonest, just, thoughtful, or helpful is always a reason to do it. The\ninvariant core is given by the virtues, therefore, and the variant\nperiphery depends upon that invariant core. This last point is\nimportant, because this defence of generalism needs to show why it is\nthat morality requires a basis of invariance. Just to come up\nwith a few invariant reasons is nothing to the point. Those who\nsuppose they can seriously damage particularism by specifying a few\n(probably fairly complex) invariant reasons do little to show that\nmoral thought depends (as it was put in the Introduction above) on a\nsuitable provision of principles (which we are now understanding as\n\u2018invariant reasons\u2019). The suggestion we are dealing with\nnow does well in this respect. We are offered an invariant core and an\naccount of why there must be such a core if moral thought is to be\npossible at all.\n\n\nOf course, for the suggestion to work, it must be the case that the\nvirtues function invariantly. Particularists are likely to say, for\ninstance, that an action can be considerate without necessarily being\nthe better for it. It may be considerate to wipe the torturer\u2019s brow,\nbut this fact hardly functions as a reason to wipe, or makes his sweat\na reason for us to wipe it off. The torturer\u2019s other activities\nprevent what would ordinarily give us a reason from doing so\nhere. Similarly, it may be that a cruel response is exactly the one\ncalled for in the circumstances; cruelty, according to particularists,\nneed not be an invariant reason. A generalist reply to these\nsuggestions depends on showing that similar remarks cannot be made\nabout (a sufficient range of) the other virtues.\n\n\nWhat is at issue between particularism and generalism is the nature of\nmoral rationality. Particularists maintain that there can be\nreasons\u2014moral reasons\u2014even if the features that give us\nthose reasons function variably rather than invariably in their\nreason-giving.  Generalists suppose that this is not possible. They\nclaim either that all reasons, when properly understood,\nmust function invariably, or that there is an invariant core even if\nthere is a variable periphery. To argue for the first claim, they\noften demand, for each reason, that there be a discoverable guarantee\nof its status as such. But until they have offered some justification\nfor this demand, their generalism will rest on nothing. Crisp\u2019s\nposition is a model of the second approach because it offers an\naccount of why the variability that the particularist is so fond of\npointing to must be built around an invariant core. But I would say\nthat the supposed virtues do not in fact play the role required\nhere.\n",
