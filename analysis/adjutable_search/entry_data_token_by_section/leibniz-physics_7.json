    "main_text": "Leibniz\u2019s Dynamics || Physics and active forces\n3.2 Physics and active forces\n\n\nIn his important summary of his dynamics \u2013 generally known by \nits Latin title \u201cSpecimen Dynamicum\u201d \u2013 \nLeibniz distinguishes between two kinds of active force. The first, \nand most important, is of course vis viva itself. In the \ncontext of his physics, vis viva, or \u201cliving \nforce,\u201d represents for Leibniz a measure of a body\u2019s ability to\nbring about effects in virtue of its motion. It is an active force \nwhich allows a moving body to, say, raise itself up to a given height\nor impart a motion to a slower body. (Intuitively, we might think of \nit as the \u201cforce\u201d that a bowling ball, for example, has \nin virtue of its falling from some height, or the power a baseball \nhas once released from a pitcher\u2019s hand.) As noted above, Leibniz \nmaintains that vis viva is conserved both locally in \nparticular cases of impact, and globally in the created world taken \nas a whole. The living force a body expends in raising itself to a \ngiven height must therefore be equal to the living force it gains by \nfalling from that height; the vis viva a body is able to \ntransfer to another body through impact must be equal to the \nmeasurement of vis viva it loses during that \n impact.[19]\n\n\n\nThe fact that collisions between actual bodies are never perfectly \nelastic represents a prima facie objection to the \nconservation of vis viva. Although the law looks tolerably \naccurate if we consider the collision of, say, two billiard balls, or\ntwo steel spheres, it seems woefully off if we consider, say, the \ncollision of two lumps of clay, or two scoops of ice cream. Indeed, \nin non-elastic collisions it appears that much \u2013 even all \n\u2013 of the active force of the colliding bodies as measured by \nmv2 may be lost. In addressing this \nfairly obvious worry, Leibniz returns to the idea that any body \n\u2013 no matter how small \u2013 must be composed of infinitely \nmany smaller bodies. He then argues that the apparent loss of vis\nviva in cases of inelastic collision is to be attributed to the \nfact that living force has been transferred to the smaller parts of \nthe gross bodies in a way that does not contribute fully to the \nmotion of the whole. It is thus lost in the sense that it does not \ncontribute to the motion of the larger bodies, but it is nonetheless \nconserved in the deeper sense that it is still present in the motion \nof the smaller bodies from which the larger bodies are constituted. \nLeibniz therefore insists, \u201cwhen the parts of the bodies absorb\nthe force of the impact, as a whole, as when two pieces of rich earth\nor clay come into collision \u2026 when, I say, some force is \nabsorbed by the parts, it is as good as lost \u2026 But this loss \n\u2026 does not detract from the inviolable truth of the law of the\nconservation of the same force in the world. For that which is \nabsorbed by the minute parts is not absolutely lost for the universe,\nalthough it is lost for the total force of the concurrent \nbodies\u201d (GM VI.230/Langley 670).\n\n\nIn his Specimen, Leibniz terms his second postulated active \nforce \u201cvis mortua\u201d or \u201cdead force,\u201d \nalthough it also appears in connection with the titles, \n\u201csolicitation,\u201d \u201cconatus,\u201d and \n\u201cimpetus.\u201d In spite of their correlative labels, the \nnotion of dead force appears to be less carefully worked out by \nLeibniz than the notion of living force. In the Specimen he \ntells us:\n\n\nOne force is elementary which I also call dead force, since \nmotion does not yet exist in it, but only a solicitation to motion, \nas with \u2026 a stone in a sling while it is still being held by a\nrope\u2026. An example of dead force is centrifugal force itself, \nand also the force of heaviness or centripetal force, and the force \nby which a stretched elastic body begins to restore itself. But when \nwe are dealing with impact, which arises from a heavy body which has \nalready been falling for some time, or from a bow that has already \nbeen restoring its shape for some time, or from a similar cause, the \nforce in question is living force, which arises from an infinity of \ncontinual impressions of dead force. (GM VI.238f/AG 121f)\n\n\nFrom this passage and surrounding texts, we can glean three central \nideas Leibniz associates with the notion of dead force. First, just \nas we might think of vis viva as a measure of the force a \nmoving body has in virtue of its being in motion, so we might think \nof vis mortua as a measure of the force a body has to bring \nabout motion even while at rest, or at an instant. Second, living \nforce is related to dead force by an infinite summation; vis \nviva is, as it were, an infinite accumulation of individual \ninstances of vis \n mortua.[20]\n Third, dead force is thus more immediately related to the study of \nstatics than to the study of dynamics, and Leibniz repeatedly \nsuggests that Cartesians have indeed been misled into maintaining the\nconservation of quantity of motion by confusing the laws of statics \nwith the laws of dynamics.\n\n\nOn some ways of reading of Leibniz\u2019s texts, the measure of dead force\napproaches very closely the measure of force more clearly at work in \nNewton\u2019s \n Principia.[21]\n It is therefore worth noting that although he could hardly deny the \ntechnical achievement of Newton\u2019s masterpiece, Leibniz was \nnonetheless eager to distance his own thinking about force from that \nof his great rival\u2019s. In a polemical piece whose title has been \ntranslated as \u201cAgainst Barbaric Physics,\u201d Leibniz writes:\n\n\nIt is, unfortunately, our destiny that, because of a certain aversion\ntoward light, people love to be returned to darkness\u2026. That \nphysics which explains everything in the nature of body through \nnumber, measure, weight, or size, shape and motion, and so teaches \nthat, in physics, everything happens mechanically, that is, \nintelligibly, this physics seems excessively clear and easy\u2026.\nIt is permissible to recognize magnetic, elastic, and other sorts of \nforces, but only insofar as we understand that they are not primitive\nor incapable of being explained, but arise from motions and shapes. \nHowever, the new patrons of such things don\u2019t want this. And it\nhas been observed that in our own times there was a real suggestion \nof this view among certain of our predecessors who established that \nthe planets gravitate and tend toward one another. It pleased them to\nmake the immediate inference that all matter essentially has a \nGod-given and inherent attractive power and, as it were, mutual love,\nas if matter had senses, or as if a certain intelligence were given \nto each part of matter by whose means each part could perceive and \ndesire even the most remote thing. (G VII.337\u2013339/AG 312=313; see \nalso Leibniz\u2019s fourth paper to Clarke, paragraph 45/Alexander 43) \n\n\nThe grounds for Leibniz\u2019s negative reaction to Newton\u2019s conception of\nforce, and specifically Newton\u2019s apparent postulation of a universal force\nof gravitation, are various and complex. One especially important \ntheme, however, indicated in the passage above, concerns what \nconception of force should be allowed to operate in the study of \nphysics. On the negative side, Leibniz thought that by postulating \nwhat he understood to be an irreducible force holding between bodies \nand acting at a distance, Newton had abandoned the intelligible \nexplanations of the mechanical philosophy, and returned to \nuninformative scholastic accounts that rested content with the \npostulation of primitive powers. On the positive side, Leibniz \nthought that by treating forces as inherent powers of bodies tied \ninextricably to their ability to move and be moved, his own \nconception of force could preserve the intelligibility that was the \ngreat hallmark of mechanism, while nonetheless improving upon the \nwork of those such as Huygens, Descartes and Galileo. For, by \nLeibniz\u2019s lights, the active and passive forces he postulates not \nonly render physics itself more accurate and consonant with reason \nbut at the same time set the stage for its intelligible grounding in \nhis own deeper metaphysics. In this way, Leibniz\u2019s understanding of \ndynamics becomes inextricably bound up with his more thoroughly \nmetaphysical views to which we must now briefly turn. \n",
