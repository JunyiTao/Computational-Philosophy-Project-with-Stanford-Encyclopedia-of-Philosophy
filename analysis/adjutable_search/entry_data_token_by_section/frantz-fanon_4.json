    "main_text": "The Case Studies\n5. The Case Studies\n\nFanon\u2019s training in psychiatry is a central part of his work,\nfrom the methodological approaches to and characterizations of the\ndynamics of anti-Black racism in Black Skin, White Masks\nthrough the attention to postcolonial anxieties of cultural formation\nand statecraft in The Wretched of the Earth.\n\nBut apart from method alone, Fanon\u2019s published and unpublished\nworks offer case studies of victims of colonialism, studies which\nemphasize the lived pathologies of everyday life under colonial rule.\nMany of these are in the unpublished writings collected in\n\u00c9crits sur l\u2019ali\u00e9nation et la\nlibert\u00e9, but a key series of case studies are included in\nThe Wretched of the Earth. These studies are generally\nunder-thematized by Fanon scholars and postcolonial theory scholars\nmore widely, though a few recent publications indicate a renewed\ninterest in how concrete psychiatric work might function as part of\nthe postcolonial theory archive and in Fanon\u2019s larger project.\nThe collaborative study by Nigel Gibson and Roberto Beneduce\nFrantz Fanon: Psychiatry and Politics (2017) goes a long way\ntoward closing this gap in the literature, examining in detail both\nthe history and theoretical work underlying Fanon\u2019s psychiatric\nwritings and case studies. As well, David Marriott\u2019s Whither\nFanon (2018) embeds the psychiatric writings and therapeutic\npractice inside Fanon\u2019s work on anti-blackness and postcolonial\npolitics.\n\nFanon\u2019s original studies consider a range of disorders resulting\nfrom colonial violence. Some are mental disorders, by which Fanon\nmeans a generalized sense of anxiety caused by colonial domination and\nacted out in discrete parts of the personality. Others bear the\ndisorder on the body and disfigure the person from the inside out or\ncreate sexual disorders connected to colonial degradations around\nfemininity and masculinity. As well, Fanon includes a short piece at\nthe end of The Wretched of the Earth on the medicalization of\ncriminality in Algeria, with particular interest in how those\ndisorders might be repurposed for the sake of revolutionary struggle.\nThe studies are very detailed and narrativized, which opens up a new\ndimension of Fanon as critical observer. The studies also draw out the\ntension between psychiatric treatment and political ideology,\nsomething Fanon would argue is not overlaid on the situation by the\ntherapist, but instead discovered, in therapy, to have been installed\nby the colonial order. The influence of this aspect of Fanon\u2019s\nwork can be seen in the Black Panther Party\u2019s work in the United\nStates on prisoner reintegration and public health initiatives, all of\nwhich were seen as blending care for the oppressed with harnessing\nrevolutionary potential.\n",
