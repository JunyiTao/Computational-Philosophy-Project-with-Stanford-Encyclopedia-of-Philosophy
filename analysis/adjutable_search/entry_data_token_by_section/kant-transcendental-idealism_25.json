    "main_text": "Things in themselves, noumena, and the transcendental object || The transcendental object = X\n6.2 The transcendental object = X\n\nIn the \u201cPhenomena and noumena\u201d section, Kant distinguishes\nthe concept of a noumenon from the concept of a \u201ctranscendental\nobject\u201d (A250). This is a reference to a notion introduced in\nthe A version of the \u201cTranscendental Deduction\u201d: \n\n\nThe pure concept of the transcendental object (which in all of our\ncognition is really one and the same = X) is that which in all\nof our empirical concepts in general can provide relation to an\nobject, i.e., objective reality. Now this concept cannot contains any\ndeterminate intuition at all, and therefore contains nothing but that\nunity which must be encountered in a manifold of cognition insofar as\nit stands in relation to an object. (A109; cf. A104)\n\n\nThe \u201cconcept of a transcendental object\u201d might be\nfruitfully thought of as \u201cthe transcendental concept of an\nobject\u201d: the concept of \u201cobject\u201d that makes\nexperience possible. Our mind\u2019s synthesis of representations\ninto experience of objects is guided and made possible by the idea\nthat there is a way objects are that must be tracked by our\nrepresentations of them. This wholly abstract concept of \u201ca way\nthings are\u201d is the concept of the transcendental object =\nX, the indeterminate concept of the \u201ctarget\u201d of our\nrepresentational activity. Consequently, the concept of the\ntranscendental object must be distinct from the concept of\n\u201cthings in themselves\u201d or \u201cnegative noumena\u201d.\nThe concept of things in themselves is the concept of the (unknowable\nby us) objects (or aspects of objects) that appear to us the 3D world\nof space and time. They are the grounds of phenomena, while the\ntranscendental object is the very abstract idea of those objects in\nspace and time as the targets of our cognitive activity.\n\nAnother way to appreciate this distinction is to consider the\ndifference in why these notions of object (noumena, transcendental\nobject) are unknowable by us. We cannot cognize things in themselves\nbecause cognition requires intuition, and our intuition only ever\npresents appearances, not things in themselves. We cannot cognize the\ntranscendental object because the transcendental object is a purely\nschematic, general idea of empirical objectivity. Whenever we cognize\na determinate empirical object we are cognitively deploying the\ntranscendental concept of an object in general, but we are not coming\nto know anything about the object of that concept as such.\n\nThis is Kant\u2019s point in \u201cphenomena and noumena\u201d when\nhe writes: \n\n\nThis transcendental object cannot even be separated from the sensible\ndata, for then nothing would remain through which it would be\nthought. It is therefore no object of cognition in itself, but only\nthe representation of appearances under the concept of an object in\ngeneral, which is determinable through the manifold of those\nappearances. (A250\u20131) \n\n\nThe (negative) concept of a noumenon is the concept of an object that\nis not an object of our sensible spatiotemporal intuition. But the\ntranscendental object makes no sense in abstraction from intuition,\nbecause it is merely the abstract concept that the unity of our\nintuitions must have in order to constitute experience of an object\n(cf. Allison\u2019s classic 1968 paper).\n",
