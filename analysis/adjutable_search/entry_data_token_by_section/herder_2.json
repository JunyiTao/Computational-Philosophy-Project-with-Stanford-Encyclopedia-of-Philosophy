General Program in Philosophy\n\nThe extent of Hamann\u2019s influence on Herder\u2019s best thought\nhas been greatly exaggerated by some of the secondary literature\n(e.g., Isaiah Berlin). But Kant\u2019s influence was early,\nfundamental, and enduring. However, the Kant who influenced Herder in\nthis way was the pre-critical Kant of the early and middle\n1760s, not the critical Kant (against whom Herder later engaged in\nthe\u2014rather distracting and ineffective\u2014public polemics of\nthe Metacritique and the Calligone).\n\nSome of the pre-critical Kant\u2019s key positions in the 1760s,\nsharply contrasting with ones that he would later adopt during the\ncritical period, were: a (Pyrrhonist-influenced) skepticism about\nmetaphysics; a form of empiricism; and a (Hume-influenced)\nsentimentalism in ethics. Herder took over these positions in the\n1760s and retained them throughout his career. It should by no means\nbe assumed that this debt to the early Kant is a debt to a\nphilosophically inferior Kant, though; a good case could be\nmade for the very opposite.\n\nHerder\u2019s 1765 essay How Philosophy Can Become More Universal\nand Useful for the Benefit of the People is a key text for\nunderstanding both his debt to Kant and the broad orientation of his\nphilosophy. The essay was written under strong influence from Kant,\nespecially, it seems, Kant\u2019s 1766 essay Dreams of a Spirit\nSeer, which Kant sent to Herder prior to its publication\n(\u201ca sheet at a time\u201d, Herder reports\n[B2:259]).\n\nHerder\u2019s essay answers a prize question set by a society in\nBern, Switzerland: \u201cHow can the truths of philosophy become more\nuniversal and useful for the benefit of the people?\u201d This\nquestion was conceived in the spirit of the\nPopularphilosophie that was competing with school-philosophy\nin the German-speaking world at the time. Kant himself tended to\nidentify with Popularphilosophie at this period, and\nHerder\u2019s selection of this question shows him doing so as well.\nBut in his case the identification would last a lifetime. Philosophy\nshould become relevant and useful for the people as a whole\u2014this\nis a basic ideal of Herder\u2019s philosophy.\n\nLargely in the service of this ideal, Herder\u2019s essay argues in\nfavor of two sharp turns in philosophy, turns that would again remain\nfundamental throughout the rest of his career. The first turn consists\nin a rejection of traditional metaphysics, and closely follows an\nargument of Kant\u2019s in Dreams of a Spirit Seer.\nHerder\u2019s case is roughly this: (1) Traditional metaphysics,\nthrough undertaking to transcend experience (or strictly speaking, a\nlittle more broadly, \u201chealthy understanding\u201d, which\nincludes, in addition to empirical knowledge, also ordinary morality,\nintuitive logic, and mathematics), succumbs to unresolvable\ncontradictions between its claims, and hence to the Pyrrhonian\nskeptical problem of an equal plausibility on both sides that requires\na suspension of judgment (\u201cI am writing for Pyrrhonists\u201d,\nHerder says [HPW 8]). Moreover (Herder goes on to add\nin the Fragments of 1767\u20138), given the truth of a\nbroadly empiricist theory of concepts, much of the terminology of\ntraditional metaphysics turns out to lack the basis in experience that\nis required in order even to be meaningful, and is consequently\nmeaningless (the illusion of meaningfulness arising through the role\nof language, which spins on, creating illusions of meaning,\neven after the empirical conditions of meaning have been left behind).\n(2) Traditional metaphysics is not only, for these reasons, useless;\nit is also harmful, because it distracts its adherents from\nthe matters that should be their focus: empirical nature and human\nsociety. (3) By contrast, empirical knowledge (or strictly speaking, a\nlittle more broadly, \u201chealthy understanding\u201d) is free of\nthese problems. Philosophy should therefore be based on and continuous\nwith this.\n\nHerder\u2019s second sharp turn concerns ethics. Here again he is\nindebted to the pre-critical Kant, but he also goes somewhat further\nbeyond him. Herder\u2019s basic claims are these: (1) Morality is\nfundamentally more a matter of sentiments than of cognitions. (2)\nCognitivist theories of morality\u2014of the sort espoused in this\nperiod by Rationalists such as Wolff, but also by many other\nphilosophers before and since (for example, Plato, the critical Kant,\nand G.E. Moore)\u2014are therefore based on a mistake, and so useless\nas means of moral enlightenment or improvement. (3) But (and here\nHerder\u2019s theory moves beyond Kant\u2019s), worse than that,\nthey are actually harmful to morality, because they weaken\nthe moral sentiments on which morality really rests. In This Too a\nPhilosophy of History and On the Cognition and Sensation\nHerder suggests several reasons why: (a) Abstract theorizing weakens\nsentiments generally, and hence moral sentiments in\nparticular (this is perhaps his least interesting reason). (b) The\ncognitivists\u2019 theories turn out to be so strikingly\nimplausible that they bring morality itself into disrepute, people\nreacting to them roughly along the lines of thinking, If this is\nthe best that even the experts can say in explanation and\njustification of morality, then morality must certainly be a sham, and\nI may as well ignore it and do as I please. (c) Such theories\ndistract people from recognizing, and working to reinforce, the\nreal foundations of morality: not an imaginary theoretical\ninsight of some sort, but a set of causal mechanisms that inculcate\nand sustain the moral sentiments. (4) More constructively, Herder\naccordingly turns instead to discovering theoretically and promoting\nin practice just such a set of causal mechanisms. In How\nPhilosophy Can Become he mainly emphasizes forms of education and\nan emotive type of preaching in this connection. But elsewhere he\nidentifies and promotes a much broader set of mechanisms as well,\nincluding: the influence of morally exemplary individuals; morally\nrelevant laws; and literature (along with other forms of art).\nLiterature is a special focus of Herder\u2019s theory and practice\nhere. He sees literature as exerting a moral influence in several\nways\u2014for instance, not only through fairly direct moral\ninstruction, but also through the literary perpetuation (or creation)\nof morally exemplary individuals (e.g., Jesus in the New Testament),\nand through the exposure of readers to other people\u2019s inner\nlives and a consequent enhancement of their sympathies for them (a\nmotive that lies behind his epoch-making publication of the\nPopular Songs [Volkslieder] [1774/1778\u20139], a\ncollection of translations of poems from peoples around the world).\nHerder\u2019s development of this theory and practice of moral\npedagogy was lifelong and tireless.\n",
