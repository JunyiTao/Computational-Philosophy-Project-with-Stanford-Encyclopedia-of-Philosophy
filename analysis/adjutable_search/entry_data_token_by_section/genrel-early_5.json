    "main_text": "Machian Positivism || Emerging Anti-Positivism\n2.5 Emerging Anti-Positivism\n\nAs Einstein\u2019s principal research activity turned, after 1919, to\nthe pursuit of a geometrical theory unifying gravitation and\nelectromagnetism, his philosophical pronouncements increasingly took\non a more realist or at least anti-positivist coloration. Lecturing at\nthe Sorbonne in April 1922 (1922: 28), Einstein pronounced Mach\n\u201cun bon m\u00e9canicien\u201d (probably a reference\nto Mach\u2019s views of the relativity of inertia) but \u201cun\nd\u00e9plorable philosophe\u201d. Increasingly,\nEinstein\u2019s retrospective portrayals of the genesis of general\nrelativity centered almost entirely on the success of a strategy\nemphasizing mathematical aesthetics (see Norton 2000, Ryckman 2014,\nand\n \u00a75).\n Positivists and operationalists alike continued to point to the\nEinstein analysis of simultaneity as relativity theory\u2019s\nfundamental methodological feature. One, ruefully noting the\ndifficulty of giving an operationalist analysis of the general theory,\neven suggested that the requirement of general covariance\n\u201cconceals the possibility of disaster\u201d (Bridgman 1949:\n354). Finally there was, for Einstein, an understandable awkwardness\nin learning of Mach\u2019s surprising disavowal of any role as\nforerunner to relativity theory in the Preface, dated 1913,\nto Mach\u2019s posthumous book (1921) on physical optics. Though\nEinstein died without knowing differently, a recent investigation has\nbuilt a strong case that this statement was forged after Mach\u2019s\ndeath by his son Ludwig, under the influence of a rival guardian of\nMach\u2019s legacy and opponent of relativity theory, the philosopher\nHugo Dingler (Wolters 1987).\n",
