    "main_text": "Sin as Action || Primal Sin\n2.1 Primal Sin\n\nAmong individual acts of sin, special importance attaches to the\ntemporally first sin, which is referred to as the \u201cprimal\nsin\u201d. (Most take this to be the temporally first sin regardless\nof whether it was committed by an angelic or human being, although\nsome take it to be the first human sin committed.) Scott MacDonald\ndescribes the primal sin as follows:\n\n\nThe fall of the angels constitutes the paradigm case [of\nevil-originating free choice] since, unlike Adam\u2019s and\nEve\u2019s sin in the garden, the first angelic sin is entirely\nunprecedented. We can think of that first evil free choice as\nconstituting primal sin. The first sin deserves to be called primal,\nhowever, not just because it is temporally first but also because it\nis something radically new in creation: the first evil appears against\na backdrop of utter goodness. All things created by God, including the\nrational creatures whose free choices are the original evils, are\nwholly good and without flaw.\u2026There can be no context of defect\nor corruption into which the first sin fits. Good creatures with good\nwills voluntarily introduce evil into a world where there was none\nbefore. Primal sin is not only unprecedented but also seemingly\nunprepared for and unprompted. (MacDonald 1998: 110\u20131; see also\nRogers 2008 and Couenhoven 2013: chapter 1)\n\n\nThe very notion of a primal sin implies that there was a time when\ncreation was without sin. While a temporally first sin would seem to\nbe required by a finite past, discussions of the primal sin often\npresuppose that there was a time of perfect creation prior to a fall,\nwhich is more contentious. As Craig A. Boyd argues, given that it\nconflicts with contemporary science,\n\n\nthe claim that creation was originally perfect in every\nrespect\u2014the idea that an idyllic paradise existed without death,\ndisease, poison or weeds before the first human [or angelic]\nsin\u2014is especially problematic. (Boyd 2009: 111)\n\n\nBut one need not take the story of the fall literally to think that\nthere was a primal sin. (For a discussion of the historicity of the\nfall as it relates to sin, see McLeod-Harrison 2019; Smith 2017; and\nMcCall 2019, appendix.) Even if one rejects the notion of a historical\nfall, Christianity nevertheless traditionally holds that all that God\ncreates is good. But if both humans and angels are created good, how\nis it that at least some of them do evil? (This is what John Hick\nrefers to as the problem of the \u201corigin of evil ex\nnihilo\u201d; see Hick 1968: 595.) The answer to this question,\nof course, is that an agent does evil because it wills to do\nevil. But this answer immediately raises another question: where does\nwill for evil originate in free agents? This question is especially\npressing given that many Christian traditions have held that free\nagents were created able both to sin and to refrain from sinning, a\nstate sometimes called the status integritatis. While a\ncreature\u2019s having free will in the status integritatis\nmight account for the possibility of evil, it isn\u2019t sufficient\nto explain why that possibility was actualized by an otherwise morally\nuntarnished creature. The primal sin can thus be seen as a specific\ninstance of what Peter Kivy calls \u201cthe secular problem of\nevil\u201d: \u201ccases of evil [action] in which the perpetrator\nappears to pursue no real or apparent good\u201d (Kivy 1980). One\nmight say that the initial choice to sin involved a perceived good,\nperhaps the assertion of one\u2019s own independence from God in an\nact of pride, self-love, or envy. What is perplexing is how that sin\ncould come about in a non-sinful being\u2014why is it that a\nnon-sinful agent would wrongly but culpably conceive of such as act as\ngood? How could a non-sinful agent be drawn to a sinful action in the\nfirst place?\n\nIn general, two different approaches to explaining the primal sin have\nbeen offered. Because the philosophical work on the primal sin is\nconducted largely in dialogue with medieval figures, drawing on a\ncomplex moral psychology in which the faculties of the intellect and\nwill play an essential role, I also discuss these two approaches in\nthose terms. Put simply, there can be no sin without the involvement\nof the intellect and will (see McCluskey 2017: 21 and 100); the\ndifference between the two approaches is whether they locate that sin\nprimarily in the will or in the intellect. Voluntarists, on the one\nhand, hold that human beings act freely primarily in virtue of the\nfaculty of the will, and thus explain the primal sin primarily in the\nmisuse of that faculty. (Robert Brown notes that in the history of\nChristian theology, voluntarism is the dominant view; see Brown 1978).\nIntellectualism, on the other hand, holds that human beings act freely\nprimarily in virtue of the role of the intellect, and thus that the\nprimal sin must be explained primarily in intellectual terms.\n\nIn what follows, I focus on two of the most developed extant accounts\nof primal sin in the contemporary literature: Katherin Rogers\u2019s\naccount of Anselm\u2019s voluntarist view and Scott MacDonald\u2019s\naccount of Augustine\u2019s intellectualism. Leaving aside the\nquestion of whether Rogers\u2019s and MacDonald\u2019s\ninterpretations of their historical subjects are accurate, both of\nthese interpretations present libertarian accounts insofar as they\npresuppose that the truth of theological determinism would render the\ndevil unfree, and thus not responsible, in his fall. (It is worth\nnoting that while Anselm is widely regarded as a libertarian [see\nVisser & Williams 2008 and Rogers 2008], there is disagreement\nabout how best to interpret Augustine\u2019s view of free will\n[compare Stump 2001 and Couenhoven 2017].)\n\nOn Rogers\u2019s account, Anselm holds that a free will involves two\ninclinations (or affectiones): the desire for benefit and the\ndesire for justice. The desire for benefit is the desire for things\nthe possession of which one thinks will lead to their happiness. The\ndesire for justice, in contrast, is\n\n\na desire for \u201crightness of will preserved for its own\nsake\u201d. It is therefore a second order desire that one\u2019s\nfirst order desires should be properly ordered, should be as they\nought to be. (Rogers 2008: 67)\n\n\nAnselm doesn\u2019t think anyone wills injustice, or any other sin,\nfor its own sake; rather, they will it under the description of\nsomething beneficial. Why would one choose the lower good of benefit\nover the higher good of justice? Anselm\u2019s answer cannot be\n\u201cignorance\u201d but simply \u201cbecause that is how the\nagent formed their volition\u201d. Is such a choice explicable?\nAccording to Rogers, in one sense it isn\u2019t:\n\n\n\u201cBut why did he will what he ought not?\u201d asks the student.\n\u201cNo cause preceded this will, unless it was that he was able to\nwill\u201d. But this ability per se is not really the cause, since\nthe good angels were equally able to desert justice. \u201cWhy then\ndid he will?\u201d \u2019The teacher responds, \u201cOnly because\nhe willed. For this choice had no other cause by which it was by any\nmeans impelled or drawn, but it was its own efficient cause, and\neffect, if such a thing can be said\u201d. Here we have\nlibertarianism of the self-causation variety stated with brutal\nclarity and with no attempt to downplay its core problem.\u2026\nAnselm does not go on and try to mitigate the problem of\nintelligibility. (Rogers 2008: 97)\n\n\nOn this sort of view, any attempt to fully understand the primal sin\nfalls short and must ultimately remain\n\n\nmysterious and irrational. Those who were made to love God should not\nhave found the prospect of defying God attractive, and pride should\nnot have come naturally to them. (Couenhoven 2016: 189)\n\n\nOn MacDonald\u2019s interpretation of Augustine, by contrast, the\nprimal sin involves the agent\u2019s will, but that act of will is\npreceded by an act of the intellect. As MacDonald describes the\nsituation:\n\n\nWhat could primal sinners have done to guard against sinning? I think\nthe answer must be that they failed to pay attention to the reason\nthey had for loving God above all things, namely, their knowledge that\nGod is the highest good.\u2026 Had they attended to the reasons they\npossessed, they would have seen that rationality required them to love\nGod above all things.\u2026 Primal sinners, then, must have made\ntheir evil choices in some sense without thinking, without\ndeliberating sufficiently, without taking account of relevant\ninformation that was nevertheless in their possession. (MacDonald\n1998: 120\u20131)\n\n\nIn other words, the intellect\u2019s failing to properly grasp or\nweigh the normative reasons in the first place is the primary cause of\nthe primal sin. The will\u2019s volition in the primal sin thus\nisn\u2019t a will to act contrary to what the agent knows ought not\nbe done, but results rather from ignorance or failure to give the\nright reasons the right weight (for more, see Timpe 2014a: chapter\n3).\n\nAquinas\u2019s intellectualism builds on but differs from\nAugustine\u2019s (see Stump 2001). Jonathan Edwards appears to have a\ndifferent sort of intellectualist account. On Edwards\u2019s view,\nthe will must follow its strongest motivation (Crisp 2005: 41), which\nis an output of the intellect. And more recently, Alvin Plantinga also\nendorses an intellectualist account. He suggests that while primal sin\ninvolves both affective and intellectual elements, it must originate\nwith \u201can intellectual defect; it must be by way of\nsomehow acquiring a false belief\u201d (Plantinga 2000: 211). In\nother words, there must be a \u201cprior intellectual fault\u201d\n(Plantinga 2000: 212) before any affective failure.\n",
