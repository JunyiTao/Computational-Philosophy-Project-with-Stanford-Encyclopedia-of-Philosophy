    "main_text": "Post-Quinean Strategies || Internal Dependencies\n4.3 Internal Dependencies\n\nA promising strategy for replying to these latter problems, as well as\nto Quine\u2019s challenge in a way that might even begin to provide\nwhat the neo-Cartesian wants, can be found in a proposal of Paul\nHorwich (1998, 2005). He emphasizes how the meaning properties of a\nterm are the ones that play a \u201cbasic explanatory role\u201d\nwith regard to the use of a term generally, the ones ultimately in\nvirtue of which a term is used with that meaning. For example, the use\nof \u201cred\u201d to refer to the color of blood, roses, stop\nsigns, etc,. is arguably explained by its use to refer to certain\napparent colors in good light, but not vice versa: the latter\nuse is \u201cbasic\u201d to all the other uses. Similarly, uses of\n\u201cand\u201d explanatorily depend upon its basic use in\ninferences to and from the sentences it conjoins, and number terms to\nitems in a sequence respecting Peano\u2019s axioms (Horwich,\n1998:45,129; see also Devitt 1996, 2002 for a similar proposal).\n\nAlthough by allowing for purely internal explanatory conditions, this\nstrategy offers a way to deal with response-dependent and necessarily\nempty terms, and promises a way of distinguishing analyticities from\nmere beliefs, there are still several further potential problems it\nfaces. The first is that merely appealing to a \u201cbasic\nexplanatory\u201d condition for the use of a word doesn\u2019t\ndistinguish misuses and metaphors from etymologies, derived idioms and\n\u201cdead metaphors\u201d: saying \u201cJuliet is the sun\u201d\ncan be explained by the use of \u201csun\u201d to refer to the sun,\nbut so can \u201clobbying\u201d be explained by the use of\n\u201clobby\u201d for lobbies of buildings (where politicians often\nmet), and \u201cthe eye of a needle\u201d by the shape of an animal\neye. In these latter cases, the words seem to be \u201cfrozen\u201d\nor \u201cdead\u201d metaphors, taking on meanings of their own.\nWhile they are explained by original \u201cbasic\u201d\nuses, they are no longer \u201cgoverned\u201d by them.\n\nHere it may be worth combining something of the Horwich view with\nsomething of Fodor\u2019s aforementioned cousin suggestion of the\nasymmetric counterfactual (\u00a74.2), along lines suggested by Rey\n(2009; 2020a, \u00a710.3): the new \u201cdead\u201d uses of an idiom\nor metaphor no longer asymmetrically depend upon the\nexplanatorily basic use. \u201cEye of a needle\u201d would still\nmean the hole at the end of a needle, even if \u201ceye\u201d no\nlonger referred to animal eyes. But \u201ceye\u201d used to refer\nto, say, the drawing of an eye, would both asymmetrically and\nexplanatorily depend upon its being used to refer to actual eyes. And\ndescribing a three-way correspondence as \u201ctriangular\u201d may\nasymmetrically and explanatorily depend upon thinking of certain\ngeometric figures as triangular, but not vice versa \u2013\ndespite the impossibility of there ever being any actual triangles in\nthe external world (see Allott and Textor, 2022, for development of\nthis suggestion). Taking the asymmetric dependency to be\n\u201cinternally\u201d explanatory relieves it of the excessive\nexternalism with which Fodor burdened it, while avoiding the\netymologies and dead metaphors facing Horwich\u2019s view on its\nown.\n\nHowever, although such a proposal may offer a promising strategy for\nmeeting Quine\u2019s challenge about many ordinary terms, it\nisn\u2019t clear it would work for highly theoretic ones. For if\nQuine (1953 [1980a]) is right about even a limited holism involved in\nthe use of scientific terms, then there may be no sufficiently local\nbasic facts on which all other uses of a term asymmetrically and\nexplanatorily depend. To take the kind of case that most interested\nQuine, it certainly seems unlikely that there is some small set of\nuses of, say, \u201cnumber,\u201d \u201cpositron,\u201d\n\u201cspace\u201d or \u201cbiological species\u201d that are\nexplanatorily basic, on which all other uses really depend. Such terms\noften come with a large cluster of terms appearing in claims that come\nas, so to say, a loose \u201cpackage deal,\u201d and revision over\ntime may touch any particular claim in the interests of overall\nexplanatory adequacy. Uses of a term involved in the expression of\nbelief, either in thought or talk, will likely be justified and\nexplained by the same processes of holistic confirmation that led\nQuine to his scepticism about the analytic in the first place (cf.\nGibbard, 2008). Of course, Quine might be wrong about taking the case\nof theoretic terms in science to be representative of terms in human\npsychology generally (cf. Chomsky, 2000,\n footnote 10\n above), and the above proposal might be confined to some restricted\nportions of a speaker\u2019s psychology, e.g., to perception (as in\nFodor, 1983, 2000). But, to put it mildly, the verdict on these issues\nis not quite in (see supplement \u00a7\u00a74\u20135).\n\nLastly, a third (and, for some, a serious) possible drawback of this\nstrategy is that it still risks rendering matters of meaning far less\n\u201ctransparent\u201d and introspectively accessible than\nphilosophers have standardly supposed. There is little reason to\nsuppose that what is asymmetrically-explanatorily basic about\none\u2019s use of a term in thought or talk is a matter that is\navailable to introspection or armchair reflection. As in the case of\n\u201cmarriage\u201d mentioned earlier, but certainly with respect\nto other philosophically problematic notions, just which properties,\nif any, are explanatorily basic may not be an issue that is at all\neasy to determine. What are the asymmetric-explanatorily basic uses of\n\u201cfreedom\u201d or \u201csoul\u201d? Do even people\u2019s\nuses of animal terms really depend upon dubbings of species \u2013 or\nof individual exemplars \u2013 or do they depend more upon an innate\ndisposition to think in terms of underlying biological kinds (cf. Keil\n2014, pp. 327\u2013333)? Do their uses of number words and concepts\nreally depend upon their grasp of Peano\u2019s axioms? Perhaps the\nusage is grounded more in practices of (finite) counting, estimates\nand noticing merely finite one-to-one correspondences; or\nperhaps they lie in the general recursive character of\nlanguage (cf. Hauser et al 2002). Again, one may need the\nresources of a psychology that delves into far more deeply into the\ncomplex, internal causal relations in the mind than are available at\nits introspective or behavioral surface.\n4.4 Chomskyan Strategies\n\nSuch an interest in a deeper and richer internal psychology\nemerged most dramatically in the 1950s in the work of Noam Chomsky. In\nhis (1957, 1965, 1968 [2006]) he began to revolutionize linguistics by\npresenting substantial evidence and arguments for the existence of an\ninnate \u201cgenerative\u201d grammar in a special language faculty\nin people\u2019s brains that he argued was responsible for their\nunderlying competence to speak and understand natural languages. This\nopened up the possibility of a response to Quine\u2019s (1960)\nscepticism about the analytic within his own naturalistic framework,\nsimply freed of its odd behaviorism, which Chomsky and others had\nindependently, empirically refuted (see Chomsky 1959, and Gleitman,\nGross and Reisberg 2011, chapter 7). Some of it also dovetails nicely\nwith ideas of Friedrich Waismann and the later Wittgenstein, as well\nas with important recent work on polysemy. But the program Chomsky\ninitiated is complex, and its relation to the analytic quite\ncontroversial, and so discussion of it is relegated to the following\nsupplement to this entry:\n\nSupplement: Analyticity and Chomskyan Linguistics.\n \n5. Conclusion\n\nSuppose, per the discussion of at least \u00a73 of the\nsupplement, that linguistics were to succeed in\ndelineating a class of analytic sentences grounded in the constraints\nof a special language faculty in the way that some Chomskyans\nsometimes seem to suggest. Would such sentences serve the purposes for\nwhich we noted earlier (\u00a72) philosophers had enlisted them?\nPerhaps some of them would. An empirical grounding of the analytic\nmight provide us with an understanding of what constitutes a\nperson\u2019s competence with specific words and concepts,\nparticularly logical or mathematical ones. Given that Quinean\nscepticism about the analytic is a source of his scepticism about the\ndeterminacy of cognitive states (see \u00a73.5 above), such a\ngrounding may be crucial for a realistic psychology, determining the\nconditions under which someone has a thought with a specific\ncontent.\n\nMoreover, setting out the constitutive conditions for possessing a\nconcept might be of some interest to philosophers generally, since\nmany of the crucial questions they ask concern the proper\nunderstanding of ordinary notions such as material object, person,\naction, freedom, god, the good, or the beautiful.\nSuppose, further, that a domain, such as perhaps ethics or aesthetics,\nis \u201cresponse dependent,\u201d constituted by the\nunderlying rules of our words and concepts; suppose, that is, that\nthese rules constitute the nature of, say, the good, the\nfunny, or the beautiful. If so, then it might not be\nimplausible to claim that successful conceptual analysis could provide\nus with some a priori knowledge of such domains (although,\nagain, sorting out the rules may require empirical linguistic and\npsychological theories not available to \u201carmchair\nreflection\u201d).\n\nBut, of course, many philosophers have wanted more than these\nessentially psychological gains. They have hoped that analytic claims\nmight provide a basis for a priori knowledge of domains that\nexist independently of us and are not exhausted by our concepts. An\nimportant case in point would seem to be the very case of arithmetic\nthat motivated much of the discussion of the analytic in the first\nplace. Recent work of Crispin Wright (1983) and others on the logicist\nprogram has shown how a version of Frege\u2019s program might be\nrescued by appealing not to his problematic Basic Law V, but instead\nmerely to what is called \u201cHume\u2019s Principle,\u201d or the\nclaim that for the number of Fs to be equal to the number\nof Gs is for there to be a \u201cone-to-one\ncorrespondence\u201d between the Fs and the Gs (as in the case of the\nfingers of a normal right and left hand), even in infinite cases.\nAccording to what is now regarded as \u201cFrege\u2019s\nTheorem,\u201d the Peano axioms for arithmetic can be derived from\nthis principle in standard second-order logic (see Frege\u2019s\ntheorem and foundations for arithmetic).\n\nNow, Wright has urged that Hume\u2019s Principle might be regarded as\nanalytic, and perhaps this claim could be sustained by an examination\nof the language faculty along the lines of a Chomskyan linguistics set\nout in the supplement. If so, then wouldn\u2019t that\nvindicate the suggestion that arithmetic can be known a\npriori? Not obviously, since Hume\u2019s Principle is a claim\nnot merely about the concepts F and G, but about the\npresumably concept-independent fact about the number of\nthings that are F and the number of things that are G, and, we can\nask, what justifies any claim about them? As George Boolos (1997)\nasked in response to Wright:\n\n\nIf numbers are supposed to be identical if and only if the concepts\nthey are numbers of are equinumerous, what guarantee do we have that\nevery concept has a number? (p. 253)\n\n\nIndeed, as Edward Zalta (2013) observes,\n\n\nThe basic problem for Frege\u2019s strategy, however, is that for his\nlogicist project to succeed, his system must at some point include\n(either as an axiom or theorem) statements that explicitly assert the\nexistence of certain kinds of abstract entities and it is not obvious\nhow to justify the claim that we know such explicit existential\nstatements. (2013, Section 6.2)\n\n\nThe concept of a unique successor to every number might be a defining\nfeature of the lexical item, \u201cnumber,\u201d but that\ndoesn\u2019t itself imply that an infinity of numbers actually\nexists. Meanings and concepts are one thing; reality quite\nanother. Justification of such existential statements and, with them,\nHume\u2019s Principle would seem to have to involve something more\nthan appealing to merely the concept, but also \u2014to recall\nQuine\u2019s (CLT, p. 121, \u00a73.3 above) claim\u2014 to\n\u201cthe elegance and convenience which the hypothesis brings to the\ncontaining bodies of laws and data,\u201d i.e., to our best overall\nempirical theory of the world, irrespective of what constraints\nlanguage might impose (see Wright, 1999, and Horwich, 2000, for\nfurther discussion).\n\nThe problem here becomes even more obvious in non-mathematical cases.\nFor example, philosophers have wanted to claim not merely that our\nconcepts of red and green exclude the possibility of\nour thinking that something is both colors all over, but that this\npossibility is ruled out for the actual colors,\nred and green,\nthemselves (if such there be). It is therefore no accident that\nBonjour\u2019s (1998, pp. 184\u20135) defense of a priori\nknowledge turns on resuscitating views of Aristotle and Aquinas,\naccording to which the very properties of red and\ngreen themselves are constituents of\nthe propositions we grasp. But it is just such a wonderful coincidence\nbetween merely our concepts and actual worldly\nproperties that a linguistic semantics alone obviously cannot\nensure.\n\nBut suppose, nevertheless, there did in fact exist a\ncorrespondence between our concepts and the world, indeed, a deeply\nreliable, counterfactual-supporting correspondence whereby it was in\nfact metaphysically impossible for certain claims\nconstitutive of those concepts not to be true. This is, of course, not\nimplausible in the case of logic and arithmetic, and is entirely\ncompatible with, e.g., Boolos\u2019 reasonable doubts about them\n(after all, it\u2019s always possible to doubt what is in fact a\nnecessary truth). Such necessary correspondences between thought and\nthe world might then serve as a basis for claims to a priori\nknowledge in at least a reliabilist epistemology, where what\u2019s\nimportant is not believers\u2019 abilities to justify their\nclaims, but merely the reliability of the processes by which\nthey arrive at them (see Reliabilist Epistemology). Indeed,\nin the case of logic and arithmetic, the beliefs might be arrived at\nby steps that were not only necessarily reliable, but might\nalso be taken to be so by believers, in ways that might in fact depend\nin no way upon experience, but only on their competence with the\nrelevant words and concepts (Kitcher 1980; Rey 1998; and Goldman 1999\nexplore this strategy).\n\nSuch a reliabilist approach, though, might be less than fully\nsatisfying to someone interested in the traditional analytic a\npriori. For, although someone might turn out in fact to have\nanalytic a priori knowledge of this sort, she might not\nknow that she does (reliabilist epistemologists standardly\nforgo the \u201cKK Principle,\u201d according to which if one knows\nthat p, one knows that one knows that p). Knowledge that the\nrelevant claims were knowable a priori might itself be only\npossible by an empirically informed understanding of one\u2019s\nlanguage faculty and other cognitive capacities \u00e0 la\nChomsky, and by its consonance with the rest of one\u2019s theory of\nthe world, \u00e0 la Quine. One would only know a\nposteriori that something was knowable a priori.\n\nThe trouble then is that claims that people do have a capacity for\na priori knowledge seem quite precarious. As we noted earlier\n (footnote 7),\n people are often unreliable at appreciating deductively valid\narguments; and appreciating the standard rules even of natural\ndeduction is for many people often a difficult intellectual\nachievement. Consequently, people\u2019s general competence with\nlogical notions may not in fact consist in any grip on valid logical\nrules; and so whatever rules do underlie that competence may well turn\nout not to be the kind of absolutely reliable guide to the\nworld on which the above reliabilist defense of a priori\nanalytic knowledge seems to depend. In any case, in view merely of the\nserious possibility that these pessimistic conclusions are true,\nit\u2019s hard to see how any appeal to the analytic to establish the\ntruth of any controversial claim in any mind-independent domain could\nhave any special justificatory force without a sufficiently detailed,\nempirical psychological theory to back it up.\n\nMoreover, even if we did have a true account of our minds and the\nsemantic rules afforded by our linguistic and conceptual competence,\nit\u2019s not clear it would really serve the \u201carmchair\u201d\npurposes of traditional philosophy that we mentioned at the outset\n(\u00a71). Consider, for example, the common puzzle about the\npossibility that computers might actually think and enjoy a mental\nlife. In response to this puzzle some philosophers, e.g, Wittgenstein\n(1953 [1967], \u00a7\u00a7111, 281), Ziff, 1959, and Hacker, 1990,\nhave suggested that it\u2019s analytic that a thinking thing must be\nalive, a suggestion that certainly seems to accord with many\nfolk intuitions (many people who might cheerfully accept a\ncomputational explanation of a thought process often balk at the\nsuggestion that an inanimate machine engaging in that computation\nwould actually be thinking). Now, as we noted in the\nsupplement, \u00a72, Chomsky (2000, p. 44) explicitly\nendorses this suggestion. So suppose then this claim were in fact\nsustained by linguistic theory, showing that the lexical item\n\u201cthink\u201d is, indeed, constrained by the feature [+animate],\nand so is not felicitously applied to artifactual computers. Should\nthis really satisfy the person worried about the possibility of\nartificial thought?\n\nIt\u2019s hard to see why. For the serious question that concerns\npeople worried about whether artifacts could think concerns whether\nthose artifacts could in fact share the genuine, theoretically\ninteresting, explanatory properties of a thinking thing (cf.\nJackson 1998, pp. 34\u20135). We might have no empirical, scientific\nreason to suppose that genuine, biological animacy (n.b., not\nmerely the perhaps purely syntactic, linguistic feature\n[+animate]!; see supplement \u00a72) actually figures among\nthem. And so we might conclude that, despite these supposed\nconstraints of natural language, inanimate computers could come to\n\u201cthink\u201d after all. Indeed, perhaps, the claim that\nthinking things must be alive is an example of a claim that is\nanalytic but false, rather as the belief that cats are\nanimals would be, should it turn that the things are actually robots\nfrom Mars; and so we should pursue the option of polysemy and\n\u201copen texture\u201d that Chomsky also endorses, and proceed to\nallow that artifacts could think.\n\nOf course, a speaker could choose not to go along with, so to say,\nopening the texture this far. But if the explanatory point were\nnevertheless correct, other speakers could of course simply proceed to\ndefine a new word \u201cthink*\u201d that lacks the animacy\nconstraint and applies to the explanatory kind that in fact turns out\nto include, equally, humans and appropriately programmed artifacts.\nThe issue would reduce to merely a verbal quibble: so computers\ndon\u2019t \u201cthink\u201d; they \u201cthink*\u201d instead.\nIndeed, it\u2019s a peculiar feature of the entire discussion of the\nanalytic that it can seem to turn on what may in the end be mere\nverbal quibbles. Perhaps the \u201clinguist turn\u201d of philosophy\nthat we sketched in \u00a7\u00a71.2\u20133.3 led into a blind alley,\nand it would be more fruitful to explore, so far as possible,\nconceptual and/or explanatory connections that may exist in our minds\nor or in the world to a large extent independently of language.\n\nIn any case, while the semantic conditions of a language might provide\na basis for securing a priori knowledge of claims about\nmind-dependent domains, such as those of perhaps ethics and\naesthetics, in the case of mind-independent domains, such as\nlogic and mathematics, or the nature of worldly phenomena such as life\nor thought, the prospects seem more problematic. There may be analytic\nclaims to be had here, but at least in these cases they would, in the\nimmortal words of Putnam (1965 [1975], p. 36), \u201ccut no\nphilosophical ice\u2026bake no philosophical bread and wash no\nphilosophical\n windows.\u201d[18]\n We would just have to be satisfied with theorizing about the\nmind-independent domains themselves, without being able to justify our\nclaims about them by appeal to the meanings of our words alone.\nReflecting on the difficulties of the past century\u2019s efforts on\nbehalf of the analytic, it\u2019s not clear why anyone would really\nwant to insist otherwise.",
