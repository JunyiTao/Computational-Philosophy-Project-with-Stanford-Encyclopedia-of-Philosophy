    "main_text": "The Target Explanandum || The Fundamental Normative Property\n1.2 The Fundamental Normative Property\n\nOur decision to focus initially on metaphysical issues doesn\u2019t\nget us any closer to what normativity is; it only tells us\nwhere to locate the initial important questions about\nnormativity. But what would make a fact be a normative one?\nWe started with some hand-wavy platitudes about normative claims being\n\u201caction-guiding\u201d, and \u201cattitude-guiding\u201d, and\nabout their giving us reasons for action, or reasons for attitudes. We\ncould also give lots of examples of normative claims, adding\nthat, if they are true, they are true in virtue of the\nnormative facts:\n\nMoral claims: It\u2019s wrong to commit adultery; Bill Gates is a\ngenerous man; it\u2019s good to love your country.\nEpistemic claims: You should believe that there is an external\nworld; George has reason to distrust Benedict; no one should believe\nwhat the sum of the evidence points decisively against.\nAesthetic claims: No Country for Old Men is the best\nmovie ever made; contrast contributes beauty to a painting; modern art\nis not good.\n\n\nBut while platitudes and examples can give one a general sense of the\nextension of the normative, they don\u2019t tell us what normativity\nis.\n\nOne way to answer this latter question, assuming there are normative\nproperties, is to figure out which normative property, if any, is\nnormatively fundamental. This is not the question about what\nis metaphysically fundamental, or fundamental simpliciter. It\nis the question of what the bottom layer of normative facts, so to\nspeak, looks like, and in particular what normative properties show up\nthere, if there is such a bottom layer. Those normative facts might be\ngrounded in non-normative facts of one kind or another, or maybe\nthey\u2019re ungrounded \u2013 we\u2019ll come to that question in\ntime. The question here is, what are the normative properties, if any,\nthat all other normative properties depend on, or are explained by?\n(We are being deliberately opaque about the sense of dependence or\nexplanation involved, since that is a matter of some\ncontroversy \u2013 while many nowadays want to construe it as grounding\n[see, for instance, Berker 2018], others are skeptical [Wielenberg\n2014: 1.5].) If we can get an answer to that question, it could tell\nus about the nature of the normative.\n\nThe most popular answer to this question, in recent years, has been\nthat facts about reasons are normatively fundamental (Parfit\n2011; Scanlon 2014; Dancy 2004). Facts about goodness, obligation,\nvirtue, etc. \u2013 all other normative facts \u2013 depend on facts\nabout reasons. Others think that value is normatively\nfundamental, explaining reasons and all other normative phenomena\n(Maguire 2016), while still others think that facts about\nfittingness are normatively fundamental (Howard 2019). Some\nhave even suggested that \u201cthin\u201d normative\nfacts \u2013 which, roughly speaking, merely tell us normative\ninformation \u2013 are the wrong focus, and that \u201cthick\u201d\nnormative facts \u2013 roughly, facts that tell us something normative\nand non-normative \u2013 could be at the bottom of it all,\nnormatively speaking (Roberts 2017, Morton 2019). On that view, the\nfact that an act is courageous is normatively more fundamental, and\nperhaps also metaphysically more fundamental, than the fact that it is\ngood, rather than the other way around.\n\nEach answer aims to give us insight into the nature of the normative.\nIt could be that normative facts are facts that either are, or depend\non, facts about reasons. Or maybe normative facts are those that are,\nor depend on, facts about value. And so on. Another possibility is\nthat no kind of normative fact is normatively fundamental (Wodak\n2020).\n\nThis methodology for determining the nature of the normative might\nseem flawed. After all, our goal was to understand what makes a\nfact be normative, and it might seem that we won\u2019t\nachieve this goal unless we can explain what makes the\nbase-facts (reasons, values, etc.) be normative. \u201cWhat\nmakes this (not normatively fundamental) fact normative?\u201d we can\nimagine someone asking. \u201cWell\u201d, we answer, \u201cit\nultimately depends on a fact about reasons\u201d. But then our\ninterlocutor might reasonably ask, \u201cOk, but what makes facts\nabout reasons normative?\u201d And here we don\u2019t have\nan answer: \u201cThey just are!\u201d we would have to say.\n\nThis worry becomes deeper when we consider the possibility of reasons\nthat are not \u201crobustly\u201d normative in the philosophically\nmost interesting and important sense. In chess, there is a reason to\ncastle early. In etiquette, there is a reason, when in Rome, to do\nwhat the Romans do. But it might seem that these reasons have no\ngenuine claim on our attention in the way that the moral reason to be\nloyal to friends does. So it would seem that the normatively\nfundamental facts about reasons, if reasons fundamentalism is indeed\non the right track, would be facts about robustly normative\nreasons. Perhaps, then, only some reasons are normatively\nfundamental \u2013 the robustly normative ones. If so, presumably the\nreasons fundamentalist would want to amend their view: what makes a\nfact normative is that it is, or depends on, a fact or facts about\nrobustly normative reasons. But then it seems important\nfor them to be able to say what makes a reason robustly\nnormative \u2013 and it would be unsatisfying for them to answer\nthat a robustly normative reason is one that makes its dependents\nrobustly normative!\n\nThere would presumably be similar worries about the other kinds of\nnormative fundamentalism: not only will we lack an explanation of what\nmakes the base-facts (reasons, values, fittingness, etc.) normative,\nbut in many cases, there will be (putative) base-facts that do not\nseem robustly normative. That will trigger a need for a\nnon-question-begging explanation of the difference between robust and\nnon-robust (putative) base-facts, which might or might not be a\ndeliverable good.\n\nWe do not think such accounts of normativity are necessarily doomed,\nhowever. The mere fact that there is no explanation for why the\nbase-facts are (robustly) normative is not decisive on its own.\nSuppose we were to claim that a certain class of facts are\nessentially normative, where an essentially normative fact is\n(roughly) a normative fact whose normativity is essential to it. And\nsuppose we were to claim, further, that there is no explanation of why\nan essentially normative fact is normative. (Note that this does\nnot entail that essentially normative facts have no\nexplanation: some naturalists might want to claim that certain kinds\nof facts are essentially normative but are fully explainable in\nnatural terms.) Taking this route, we would then claim that all other\nnormative facts derive their normativity from those essentially\nnormative facts. But that does not seem like an objection to the\nmethodology; in fact, it seems to substantially advance our\nunderstanding of normativity. By way of analogy, imagine we were\nconcerned to find out what makes an object physical. Our\nanswer: there are fundamental physical objects called atoms,\nand an object is physical just when it is composed of atoms. What\nmakes an atom physical though, one might ask? It seems that\nwe could justifiably answer that atoms are essentially\nphysical, while all other physical objects derive their physicality\nfrom atoms. In this case, it does not seem like we should throw out\nthe theory just because there is a sub-class of physical objects whose\nphysicalness does not get explained, since those objects are\nessentially physical. On the contrary, we seem to have\nlearned something substantive about the nature of the physical.\nSimilarly, we should not throw out an account of normativity just\nbecause, on that account, there is a sub-class of normative facts\nwhose normativity is not explained.\n\nOn the other hand, we think that reasons fundamentalists and their kin\ndo need a non-question-begging answer to the question of what\nmakes a reason (value, etc.) the robust kind of reason to engender\nrobust normativity. And while that order seems like a tall one, it\ndoes not seem to us to be unfillable in principle.\n\nAs an aside, note also that we have construed this method for\nunderstanding normativity in worldly, not conceptual terms. This is\ncertainly one way of doing it, but it is also possible to replicate\nthe strategy at the conceptual level. For example, one might propose a\nversion of reasons fundamentalism according to which the concept\n<reason> is the normatively fundamental concept. Such a\nview would claim that the concept <good> can be analyzed in\nterms of the concept <reason>. A conceptual version of value\nfundamentalism would do the opposite.\n\nAnd, just as we learned with Moore, the conceptual and worldly\nstrategies come apart. It might be that while goodness facts depend\nfully on reason facts, the concept <good> cannot be analyzed in\nterms of <reason>. Or, instead, it might be that while\n<good> is analyzable in terms of <reason>, goodness facts\ndo not depend on reason facts. This could obtain, for instance, if the\nerror theory is true \u2013 for in that case, while we have normative\nconcepts to analyze in terms of each other, there are no goodness or\nreason facts (or normative facts of any kind) at all.\n",
