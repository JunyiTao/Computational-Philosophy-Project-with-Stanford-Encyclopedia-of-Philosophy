    "main_text": "The Husserl Translation (1939\u201370)\n4. The Husserl Translation (1939\u201370)\n\nFindlay attitude towards Husserl was conflicted. On the one hand, he\ndeclared, more than once and without qualification, that Husserl was\n\u201cthe greatest philosopher of the twentieth century\u201d. On\nthe other, he rejected most of the philosophical claims published by\nHusserl subsequent to 1912.\n\nThe conflict was doctrinal. The biographical section has described\nFindlay\u2019s embrace of realism toward the end of his undergraduate\nyears. Through his long career, Findlay never wavered from his\ncommitment to realism, that is, to the view that very little of\nreality is \u201cmind-made\u201d. It is not surprising, then, that\nFindlay would react negatively to Husserl\u2019s swerve towards\nidealism, first exhibited in his Ideen of\n 1913.[8]\n So it was also natural for Findlay to focus on Husserl\u2019s early\nwork, the Logisiche Untersuchungen (1901\u201303) most of\nall. By the late 1930s, he was committed to translating this massive\ntext into English. (Wittgenstein asked him in 1939 why he was so\ninterested in \u201cthat old work\u201d.) When the translation\nappeared, in 1970, it made less of a splash than might have been\nexpected. Husserl\u2019s student and assistant, Marvin Farber, had\nalready published a paraphrase of the Untersuchungen in 1942,\nand laid side by side, there are not terribly significant differences\nbetween the two renditions, and some readers prefer Farber to Findlay\nthe way some Anglophone Kant readers prefer Kemp-Smith to Guyer.\n\nWhatever disagreements Findlay had as regards Husserl\u2019s\nconclusions, he never wavered from his admiration of his analytical\nabilities. He supported the approach to numbers presented in\nHusserl\u2019s Philosophy of Arithmetic (1891), a book that\nHusserl himself had repudiated. (Findlay endorsed Husserl\u2019s idea\nof numbers as essentially sequential, and held it superior to the\nFrege-Russell account: \u201cIn Principia\u201d, he once\nremarked, \u201cyou always end up counting the quantifiers\u201d\n(1975b)). He championed Husserl\u2019s lectures on the phenomenology\nof inner time consciousness (1905\u201311), arguing that the\nunfolding-folding schema (e.g., the past becoming past past, and the\npast past becoming the past past past) proposed by Husserl captured\nwhat Kant and James had correctly but dimly prefigured concerning the\nnature of time (TC: 151). Among Husserl\u2019s later works, he found\nmuch to praise in the notion of \u201clife world\u201d developed in\nHusserl\u2019s last book, Experience and Judgment\n(1939).\n\nBut as regards idealism, Findlay drew a line in the sand. It is simply\nfalse, he wrote, that esse est construi. He rejected\nHusserl\u2019s famous \u201cepoch\u00e9\u201d, or\nsuspension of the \u201cnatural attitude\u201d towards the world,\neven arguing the epoch\u00e9, is inconsistent with\nidealism. Husserl has assumed that to not affirm the natural world is\nto affirm that the natural world is not. But a true suspension would\naffirm nothing, either way.\n\n\nHusserl has provided no good\nor even meaningful reason for doubting that the natural world exists,\nhowever much that existence may also have been\n\u2018constituted\u2019 or rather reconstituted for out minds, and\nthat its processes have an important causal relation to the\nacts of constitution just mentioned, being in fact responsible for the\n\u2018fulfilment\u2019 of those acts through appropriated data, and\nthat natural objects are increasingly given as they are in and for\nthemselves, in an unbracketed and not merely bracketed sense, both\nthrough the normal perceptions of men and the theories of the less\nmethodologically prejudiced scientists. (\"Phenomenology and the Meaning of Realism,\" 1975b, 156)\n\n\nGiven such deep disparagement, what did Findlay find in Husserl that\njustified the accolades Findlay showered on him? Findlay in his last\nbook would remark that analytic philosophy has two obsessions:\nreference and representation. He found in Brentano\u2019s notion of\nintentionality, and Husserl\u2019s\u2019 implementation of it, a\ncomprehensive theory of meaning that underlay both reference and\nrepresentation and extended to areas undreamt of by the descendants of\nFrege and Russell. There is more to reference than language; there is\nmore to representation than mental mirroring. This for Findlay was the\nHusserl\u2019s enduring legacy.\n",
