Testimonia of Syrianus\u2019 literary work\n\nApart from the texts written by Syrianus that survive and are\ndiscussed in more detail under (3) below, there is evidence for a much\nwider literary output. According to the Suda, a\n10th century Byzantine encyclopedia, Syrianus wrote seven\nbooks of commentary on Homer, four on Plato\u2019s Republic,\ntwo on the theology of Orpheus as well as treatises on the Homeric\nGods, on the agreement of Orpheus, Pythagoras and Plato on the subject\nof oracles (in no less than ten books), and other exegetical works.\nThis list is evidently not complete because it fails to mention any\nwork on Aristotle; nor do we have any means of verifying the\nattribution of these works to Syrianus. As such, it would not be\nunusual at all for a Platonic philosopher to write commentaries on\nHomer and Orphic poetry, given that these early literary texts were\nthought to be replete with hidden meaning and arcane revelations.\nMoreover, shortly before his death Syrianus offered Proclus and\nDomninus a course on either the Chaldean Oracles or the Orphic\nPoems.\n\nSyrianus\u2019 commentaries were greatly admired by later generations\nof Neoplatonists (Isidore and Damascius regarded him as one of the\nbest exegetes), and he is therefore often referred to and quoted.\nCollecting these references, R.L. Cardullo (1985) inferred that, apart\nfrom the extant work on the Metaphysics, Syrianus commented\non Aristotle\u2019s Categories, De interpretatione,\nPrior Analytics, Physics, De caelo, and\nDe anima. Asclepius of Tralles (mid 6th century),\nin his commentary on the Metaphysics, preserves two fragments\nof Syrianus\u2019 exegesis of book VII (Z) of that work. There is\nalso evidence (in Proclus) that Syrianus commented on Plato\u2019s\nTimaeus and Parmenides, but it is not clear whether\nthese comments were formally composed, or circulated merely within the\nschool as transcripts of his lectures.\n",
