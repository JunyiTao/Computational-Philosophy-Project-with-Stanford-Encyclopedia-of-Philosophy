    "main_text": "Epistemology of Biomedicine\n3. Epistemology of Biomedicine\n\nThere are philosophical disputes happening at the heart of the\nbiomedical enterprise and those disputes offer a means of\nunderstanding the epistemological dimensions of biomedicine: the\nnature of evidence and knowledge in the framework. The most\ncontentious of those internal biomedicine disputes center on what the\nepistemology of biomedicine ought to be, with the rise of\n\u201cevidence-based medicine\u201d (EBM) being the event that\nprovoked the largest segment of these disputes. By examining the\ndisputes surrounding EBM, we can gain a better understanding of the\nepistemology of biomedicine, as illustrated in work such as\nSolomon\u2019s Making Medical Knowledge (2015).\n\nEvidence-based medicine is a tricky concept, since its name\nmisleadingly raises the question of who is practicing medicine that is\nnot based on evidence (Goldenberg 2006). Instead, the dispute\nis over which evidence is best and how it ought to be used. For\ninstance, physicians will often advise patients on which home\ntreatments to use for minor lower back pain, with individual\nphysicians varying in which treatments they recommend, even aside from\ndifferences in the advice based on differing patient characteristics.\nIbuprofen? Acetaminophen? Heat and/or cold compresses? Exercise? The\nstandard twentieth-century medical response would be to let physician\ngroups (including consensus groups convened for this purpose) lay out\nthe options and perhaps use their collective expertise to make a\nrecommendation, but giving great leeway to individual physicians to\nuse their individual accumulated expertise to choose another of the\navailable options seen as viable options by their peers. EBM instead\ntreats this as a matter to be largely decided by empirical research.\nI.e., we ought to run randomized control trial experiments that\ncompare the efficacy of alternative options by randomly assigning\npatients with lower back pain into Treatment A or\nTreatment B\u2014controlling for the single\nvariable\u2014and measure the effects on patients using predetermined\nmetrics (change in reported pain severity, incidence of major side\neffects, etc.). After doing multiple experiments we can then do a\n\u201csystematic review and meta-analysis\u201d that compiles the\ndata trends across parallel research studies and helps us build an\nevidence base for creating guidelines for which treatment clinicians\nought to use. Those guidelines dictate the proper default practices,\nwhich individual clinicians can contravene if specific individual\npatient needs are in conflict (e.g., a patient history of not\nresponding well to a certain medication).\n\nEBM began as a self-described Kuhnian scientific revolution of\nbiomedicine\u2014a fundamental change of worldview that is\nincommensurable with the previous one; a paradigm shift\n(Evidence-Based Medicine Working Group 1992). The most fundamental\ndispute between advocates of the EBM movement and skeptics within the\nbiomedical community is, in one sense, over the epistemic and power\nrelationships between the two halves of biomedicine: biology and\nmedicine. In biology, experimental methodologies and attempts to find\ngeneralizable population trends are valued highly; in clinical\nmedicine, the single patient and the clinician\u2019s accumulated\n(and ineffable) expert evaluation of them has long been valued very\nhighly\u2014much attention is paid to that individual patient\u2019s\ncontingencies (the particulars of their body and symptoms), with the\nclinician\u2019s accumulated knowledge and know how being relied on\nwhen determining how to proceed. Evidence-based medicine is not a\nsimplistic adoption of biology principles and their application to\nmedicine; it is not the triumph of biology over medicine in\nbiomedicine. Instead, EBM has helped to draw out deeper disagreements\nabout what it means to do and use biomedical science well.\n\nThere is a large philosophical literature on evidence-based medicine,\nwith the first monograph appearing in 2002 (Goodman 2002). Most of the\nliterature takes at least a partially skeptical stance on EBM\npractitioners\u2019 various hardline stances on evidentiary matters:\nthe suitability of clinicians relying primarily on brief synopses that\nattempt to synthesize massive bodies of evidence (Borgerson 2009); the\nroom for hidden biases in the process of evaluating medical data\n(Stegenga 2011), and more. EBM has also inspired passionate disputes\namong clinicians over how to apply its principles (Berwick 2005;\nGreenhalgh, Snow, Ryan, Rees, & Salisbury 2015). One line of\ncriticism is that its aims are noble, but have been hijacked by bad\nactors, namely corporations that learned to that by getting involved\nin the production of randomized control trial evidence they could sway\nthe evidence for the apparent safety and efficacy of their own\nproducts (Ioannidis 2016). Philosophy of EBM is given extensive\ndiscussion in the entry on\n Philosophy of Medicine,\n and as with the rest of this entry, this entry will avoid needless\nrepetition and keep the focus on biomedicine per se.\n",
