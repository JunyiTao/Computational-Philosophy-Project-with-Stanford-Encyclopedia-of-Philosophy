    "main_text": "Film as Philosophy\n7. Film as Philosophy\n\n\nEver since Plato banished poets from his ideal city in The\nRepublic, hostility towards the arts has been endemic to\nphilosophy. To a large extent, this is because philosophy and the\nvarious artforms were perceived to be competing sources of knowledge\nand belief. Philosophers concerned to maintain the exclusivity of\ntheir claim to truth have dismissed the arts as poor pretenders to the\ntitle of purveyors of truth.\n\n\nPhilosophers of film have generally opposed this view, seeing film as\na source of knowledge and, even, as potential contributor to\nphilosophy itself. This view was forcefully articulated by Stanley\nCavell, whose interest in the philosophy of film helped spark the\nfield's development. For Cavell, philosophy is inherently concerned\nwith skepticism and the different ways that it can be overcome. In his\nmany books and articles, Cavell has argued that film shares this\nconcern with philosophy and can even provide philosophic insights of\nits own (Cavell 1981; 1996; 2004).\n\nUntil recently, there have been few adherents to the idea that films\ncan make a philosophical contribution. (But see Kupfer (1999) and\nFreeland (2000) for counterinstances.) In part, this is because\nCavell's\nlinking of film to skepticism seems inadequately grounded, while his\naccount of skepticism as a live option for contemporary philosophy is\nbased on a highly idiosyncratic reading of the history of modern\nphilosophy. Nonetheless, Cavell's interpretations of individual films'\nencounter with skepticism are highly suggestive and have influenced\nmany philosophers and film scholars with the seriousness with which\nthey take film. (For one example, see Mulhall (2001).)\nNow, however, there is an ongoing debate about the philosophical\ncapacity of film.  In opposition to views like that of Cavell, a\nnumber of philosophers have argued that films can have at most a\nheuristic or pedagogic function in relation to philosophy.  Others\nhave asserted that there are clear limits to what films can accomplish\nphilosophically.  Both of these types of views regard the narrative\ncharacter of fiction films as disqualifying them from genuinely being\nor doing philosophy.\nOpponents to this point of view have pointed to a number of\ndifferent ways in which films can do philosophy.  Foremost among these\nis the thought experiment.  Thought experiments involve imaginary\nscenarios in which readers are asked to imagine what things would be\nlike if such-and-such were the case.  Those who think that films can\nactually do philosophy point out that fiction films can function as\nphilosophical thought experiments and thus qualify as philosophical\n(See Wartenberg 2007).  Many films have been suggested as candidates\nfor doing philosophy, including the Wachowski Brothers' 1999\nhit The Matrix, a film that has engendered more philosophical\ndiscussion than any other film, Memento (2000),\nand Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004).  \nPhilosophers have also begun to pay attention to a strand of\navant-garde filmmaking known as structural films.  These\nfilms are analogues to minimalism in the other arts and thus give rise\nto the question of whether they are not actual experiments that seek\nto show necessary criteria for something being a film.  If this view\nis accepted, then these films\u2014examples include The\nFlicker (1995) and Serene Velocity (1970)\u2014could be\nseen as making a contribution to philosophy by identifying such\nputative necessary features of films. This view, while adopted by\nN\u00f6el Carroll (See Carroll and Choi 2006; Thomas Wartenberg\n2007), has also been criticized on similar grounds to those used to\ndeny the philosophical potential of fiction films, namely that films\ncannot actually do the \u201chard work\u201d of philosophy.\nPhilosophers working in the Continental tradition have advocated a\nmore sweeping account of film's contribution to philosophy.  Indeed,\nthe term \"film-philosophy\" has been introduced to refer to the\nallegedly new form of philosophizing that takes place on film.  (See\nSinnerbrink 2011 for a discussion of this idea.)\nWhatever position one takes\non the possibility of \u201ccinematic philosophy,\u201d it is clear that the\nphilosophical relevance of film has been recognized by philosophers.\n Even those who deny that films can actually do philosophy have to\nacknowledge that films provide audiences with access to philosophical\nquestions and issues.  Indeed, the success of the book series\nentitled \u201cPhilosophy and X,\u201d where one can substitute any film or\ntelevision show for X, indicates that films are bringing philosophical\nissues to the attention of wide audiences.  There can be no doubt\nthat this is a healthy development for philosophy itself.\n",
