    "main_text": "Why does disability pose a problem for health care rationing? || What do head-to-head examples really tell us?\n2.4 What do head-to-head examples really tell us?\n\nFrancis Kamm has relied almost exclusively on individual head-to-head\nexamples such as these to explore intuitions about the ethical\nsignificance of disability in allocation decisions (Kamm 1993, 2004,\n2009a and b). Although her examples are vivid and the discussions\noften ethically illuminating, at the end of the day, one is left with\nthe sense that relying on our intuitions about these scenarios (and\ntheir infinite variations) is a troublingly and indeterminate\nexercise. The unrealistic simplicity of the cases might create\nskepticism about how the debate has been framed. Surely, no health\ncare decision, at the individual level, would ever be this stark and\ndevoid of uncertainties. We are never completely sure whether our\ntreatments will improve functioning, even save lives, or whether\nunintended side effects will end up making the outcome worse. In\naddition, measuring benefit in terms of QALYs is not an exact science,\nand the measurement of cost is extremely difficult, especially if, in\naddition to the direct costs from the provision of the resource, we\nadd indirect costs and opportunity costs. Although the method of\ntesting our intuitions on artificial scenarios, making increasingly\nnuanced changes in the case to highlight salient considerations, is\nphilosophical illuminating, it may arguably be somewhat\nartificial.\n\nOur intuitions seem both stable and reliable for ex ante\nexamples, where a decision is made to allocate the resource to the\nnon-disabled individual solely or automatically in terms of the\npresence of a disability in the other candidate, without any\nconsideration of relative cost or benefit or the most rudimentary use\nof CEA. Surely such a decision would be the very essence of\nprejudicial and unfair. But even here our intuitions are not\ncompletely secure since it may make a difference how the allocation\ndecision is framed. \n\nSuppose we are asked to decide between a person in a wheelchair and\nsomeone without a severe disability. If the issue is framed crudely in\nterm of \u201clives worth living\u201d and we decide on\nstereotypical and ungrounded assumptions about the abject misery of\nliving in a wheelchair, ex ante, then a case could be made\nthat our decision to favor the person without a disability was\nirrational, unfair, and discriminatory. By contrast, suppose we cast\nthe situation as one in which unavoidable scarcity necessitates a\nchoice that, however it goes, will be regrettable and unfortunate\n(sometimes called a \u201ctragic choice\u201d: see Calabresi &\nBobbitt 1978 and Nussbaum 2000). So framed, we might seem far more\nethically justified in appealing to disability, or indeed any other\nreal difference between the two individuals that is, at least in\nprinciple, relevant to our judgment. Disability, as we have seen, is an\na priori relevant consideration to health care allocation.\nWe might argue that, after all, we have no option but to choose\nsomeone (choosing no one would be both wasteful and unfair to both).\nAgainst this it might be argued that fairness in such a circumstance\ncan only be achieved by a purely random choice. \n\n",
