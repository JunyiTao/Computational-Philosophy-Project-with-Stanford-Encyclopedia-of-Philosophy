One claim is based on the naive argument described in\nthe previous section: a believer who assigns equal probabilities to\nall different worlds will make equal bets for the outcomes of quantum\nexperiments that have unequal probabilities.\n\nAnother claim, Lewis 2000, is related to the strategy of a believer in\nthe MWI who is offered to play a quantum Russian roulette\ngame. The argument is that I, who would not accept an offer to play a\nclassical Russian roulette game, should agree to play the roulette any\nnumber of times if the triggering occurs according to the outcome of a\nquantum experiment. Indeed, at the end, there will be one world in\nwhich Lev is a multi-millionaire and in all other worlds there will be\nno Lev Vaidman alive. Thus, in the future, Lev will be a rich and\npresumably happy man.\n\nHowever, adopting the Probability Postulate leads all believers in the\nMWI to behave according to the Behavior Principle and with this\nprinciple our behavior is similar to the behavior of a believer in the\ncollapse theory who cares about possible future worlds according to\nthe probability of their occurrence. I should not agree to play\nquantum Russian roulette because the measure of existence of worlds\nwith Lev dead will be much larger than the measure of existence of the\nworlds with a rich and alive Lev. This approach also resolves the\npuzzle which Wilson 2017 raises concerning The Quantum Doomsday\nArgument.\n\nAlthough in most situations the Behavior Principle makes the MWI\nbeliever act in the usual way, there are some situations in which a\nbelief in the MWI might cause a change in behaviour. Assume that I am\nforced to play a game of Russian roulette and given a choice between\nclassical or quantum roulette. If my subjective preference is to\nensure the existence of Lev in the future, I should choose a quantum\nversion. However, if I am terribly afraid of dying, I should choose\nclassical roulette which gives me some chance not to die.\n\nAlbrecht and Phillips 2014 claim that even a toss of a regular coin\nsplits the world, so there is no need for a quantum splitter,\nsupporting a common view that the splitting of worlds happens very\noften. Surely, there are many splitting events: every Geiger counter\nor single-photon detector splits the world, but the frequency of\nsplitting outside a physics laboratory is a complicated physics\nquestion. Not every situation leads to a multitude of worlds: this\nwould contradict our ability to predict how our world will look in the\nnear future.\n",
