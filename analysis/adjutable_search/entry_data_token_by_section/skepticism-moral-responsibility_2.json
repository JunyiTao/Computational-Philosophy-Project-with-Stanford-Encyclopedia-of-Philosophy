    "main_text": "Arguments for Moral Responsibility Skepticism || Hard Determinism\n2.1 Hard Determinism\n\nCausal determinism, as it is commonly understood, is roughly\nthe thesis that every event or action, including human action, is the\ninevitable result of preceding events and actions and the laws of\nnature. The traditional problem of free will and determinism\ncomes in trying to reconcile our intuitive sense of free will with the\nidea that impersonal forces over which we have no ultimate control may\ncausally determine our choices and actions. [I should note that a\nrelated problem arises with regard to God\u2019s foreknowledge (see\nthe entry on\n foreknowledge and free will).]\n In the past, the standard view advancing moral responsibility\nskepticism was hard determinism: the view that causal\ndeterminism is true, and incompatible with free will and moral\nresponsibility\u2014either because it precludes the ability to do\notherwise (leeway incompatibilism) or because it is inconsistent\nwith one\u2019s being the \u201cultimate source\u201d of action\n(source incompatibilism). For hard determinists, libertarian\nfree will is simply impossible because human actions are part of a\nfully deterministic world and compatibilism amounts to a\n\u201cquagmire of evasion\u201d (James 1884; see the entry on\n arguments for Incompatibilism).\n\nHard determinism had its classic statement in the time when Newtonian\nphysics reigned (see, Spinoza 1677 [1985]; d\u2019Holbach 1770), but\nit has very few defenders today\u2014largely because the standard\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics has been taken by many to\nundermine, or at least throw into doubt, the thesis of universal\ndeterminism. This is not to say that determinism has been refuted or\nfalsified by modern physics, because it has not. Determinism still has\nits modern defenders (e.g., Honderich 1988, 2002) and the final\ninterpretation of physics is not yet in (see, for example, the entry\non\n Bohmian mechanics).\n It is also important to keep in mind that even if we allow some\nindeterminacy to exist at the microlevel of our existence\u2014the\nlevel studied by quantum mechanics\u2014there would still likely\nremain determinism-where-it-matters (Honderich 2002: 5). That\nis, \n\n\nAt the ordinary level of choices and actions, and even ordinary\nelectrochemical activity in our brains, causal laws govern what\nhappens. It\u2019s all cause and effect in what you might call real\nlife. (Honderich 2002: 5) \n\n\nNonetheless, most contemporary skeptics tend to defend positions that\nare best seen as successors to traditional hard determinism.\n",
