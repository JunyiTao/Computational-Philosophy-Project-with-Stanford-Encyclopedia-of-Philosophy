    "main_text": "\n\nFrank Plumpton Ramsey (1903\u201330) made seminal contributions to\nphilosophy, mathematics and economics. Whilst he was acknowledged as a\ngenius by his contemporaries, some of his most important ideas were\nnot appreciated until decades later; now better appreciated, they\ncontinue to bear an influence upon contemporary philosophy. His\nhistoric significance was to usher in a new phase of analytic\nphilosophy, which initially built upon the logical atomist doctrines\nof Bertrand Russell and Ludwig Wittgenstein, raising their ideas to a\nnew level of sophistication, but ultimately he became their successor\nrather than remain a mere acolyte.\n\nThis entry covers all of Ramsey\u2019s contributions except to the\ndiscipline of economics, which is covered in the separate entry\n Ramsey and Intergenerational Welfare Economics.\n Note that all citations beginning solely with a date refer to works\nby Ramsey; these are listed by date in a subsection of the\nBibliography. Also, collections of Ramsey\u2019s works are cited by\ntwo-letter abbreviations, the keys to which are given in the first\nsubsection of the Bibliography.\n",
