    "main_text": "Language and Truth || Language and Truth\n2.2 Language and Truth\n\nThe topic of this section is Austin\u2019s views about truth.\nAustin\u2019s views about truth are scattered throughout his work,\nbut his most explicit discussion of the topic is in the paper\n\u201cTruth\u201d (1950a) (see also 1953, 1954ms, 1956b, 1962b,\n1962c). Amongst the distinctive claims Austin makes about truth are\nthe following:\n\n(1)\nThe predicate \u201cis true\u201d has a descriptive function:\n    it serves to characterize the obtaining of a relation\n    between statements and facts (1950a:\n    117\u2013121).\n(2)\nThe facts that figure in determining whether or not a\n  statement is true are particulars, for example, things,\n  features, events, and states of affairs (1950a: 121\u2013124;\n  1954ms: passim).\n(3)\nThe relation between statements and facts that underwrites the\n  truth or falsity of statements is itself underwritten by relations\n  between sentences and types of fact, and between episodes of stating\n  and particular facts (1950a: 121\u2013133).\n(4)\nHuman judgment is involved in determining whether a particular\n    fact makes true a statement. And judgment is involved in a way\n    that is sensitive to the intents and purposes with which a\n    statement is made. For that reason, truth is not a simple relation\n    between types of sentences (given their meanings) and particular\n    facts. A pair of statements made using the same sentence with\n    respect to the same facts but on different occasions\u2014given\n    different intents and purposes\u2014might differ in truth-value\n    (1950a: 122 fn2; 1962a: 40\u201341, 62\u201377, 110\u2013111;\n    1962b: \n     142\u2013147).[3]\n(5)\nDespite (1), Austin appears to endorse a form\n    of deflationism about truth\u2014a view on which truth\n    is a thin or non-explanatory notion. According to this form of\n    deflationism, saying that a statement is true is just a way of\n    saying that the statement has one or another of a range of more\n    specific positive qualities\u2014for example, that it is\n    satisfactory, correct, fair, etc. (1950a: 130; 1956b:\n    250\u2013251; 1957: 180).\n\n\nLet\u2019s start with (1)\u2013(3). Austin 1950a is ostensibly\nresponding to a proposal in Strawson 1949 according to which the\nfunction of the predicate \u201cis true\u201d is to facilitate the\nperformance of acts of affirmation or agreement, and not to describe\nthings\u2014e.g., statements\u2014as possessing the property of\ntruth. For short, Strawson claimed that \u201cis true\u201d has a\nperformative rather than a descriptive function. And\nhe accused his opponents of committing the descriptive\nfallacy: the alleged fallacy of treating expressions, or aspects\nof the use of expressions, that really serve performative purposes as\nhaving (only) a descriptive\n purpose.[4]\n One of Austin\u2019s aims was to defend the view that the predicate\n\u201cis true\u201d has a descriptive function (perhaps in addition\nto its having one or more performative functions). In pursuing that\naim, Austin also made a number of distinctive proposals about the\ndescriptive function of the truth\n predicate.[5]\n\nLet\u2019s turn, then, to the core of Austin\u2019s account of\ntruth. Austin presents his account of truth as an account of truth for\nstatements. However, \u201cstatement\u201d is at least two\nways ambiguous, covering both historical episodes in which something\nis stated\u2014what I\u2019ll refer to as\nstatings\u2014and also the things or propositions that are\nstated therein\u2014which I\u2019ll refer to as what is\nstated. Austin isn\u2019t especially careful about the\ndistinction, but it\u2019s possible to reconstruct much of what he\nsays in a way that respects it (for discussion of the distinction see\ne.g., Cartwright 1962).\n\nAustin\u2019s primary interest appears to be the truth of\nstatings. He writes of \u201cstatement\u201d that it has\n\u201cthe merit of clearly referring to the historic use of a\nsentence by an utterer\u201d (1950a: 121). However, statings are not\nordinarily said to be true or false, except derivatively insofar as\nwhat is stated in them is true or false. Rather, statings are assessed\nas, for example, correct or incorrect, appropriate or inappropriate,\nand so forth. However, it is plausible that stating correctly is\nclosely associated with making a statement that is true. And\nAustin\u2019s account can be understood as an account of the\nconditions in which statings are such that what is stated in them is\n true.[6]\n\nAustin presents the core of his account of truth in the following\nway:\n\n\nWhen is a statement true? The temptation is to answer (at least if we\nconfine ourselves to \u201cstraightforward\u201d statements):\n\u201cWhen it corresponds to the facts\u201d. And as a piece of\nstandard English this can hardly be wrong. Indeed, I must confess I do\nnot really think it is wrong at all: the theory of truth is a series\nof truisms. Still, it can at least be misleading. (1950a: 121)\n\n\nThe two obvious sources of potential misdirection in the formula that\nAustin endorses here are its appeal to correspondence and its\nappeal to\n facts.[7]\n Austin attempts to prevent our being misled by explaining how those\ntwo appeals ought to be understood. Austin\u2019s focus in his\n\u201cTruth\u201d (1950a) is mainly on the nature of correspondence.\nHe deals more fully with facts in his \u201cUnfair to Facts\u201d\n(1954ms).\n\nIn giving an account of correspondence, Austin makes appeal to two\ntypes of (what he calls) conventions\n (as per (3) above):[8]\n\nDescriptive conventions. These correlate\nsentences with types of situation, thing, event,\netc., in the world.\n Demonstrative conventions. These correlate\nstatements (statings) with historic\n(particular, concrete) situations, things, events, etc., in the world.\n(1950a:\n 121\u2013122)[9]\n\n\nThe descriptive conventions associate sentences with (types\nof) ways for things to be: ways for situations, things, events, etc.\nto be. For instance, the sentence \u201cThe cat is on the mat\u201d\nis associated with a type of way for things to be in which the cat is\non the mat. A variety of different historic situations might be of\nthat type. For instance, one historic situation of that type might\ninvolve Logos (Derrida\u2019s cat), while a different historic\nsituation of the same type might involve Nothing (Sartre\u2019s cat).\nSimilarly, cat-mat pairings that took place at different times would\nbe different historic situations or events and yet might be of the\nsame type.\n\nThe demonstrative conventions, by contrast, associate\nparticular statings\u2014themselves historic events\u2014with some\namongst the accessible historic situations, things, events, etc.\nConsider, for example, the following simplified case. There are two\naccessible situations, one of which is of the cat-on-mat type and one\nof which is of the dog-on-linoleum type. The descriptive conventions\ngoverning the English sentence \u201cThe cat is on the mat\u201d do\nnot, and cannot, determine which of the two accessible situations a\nspeaker aims to talk about on a particular occasion. In order to\nachieve that, the speaker must find a way of making manifest that\ntheir goal is to select, say, the dog-on-linoleum situation. They\nmight achieve this by, for example, their use on a particular occasion\nof the present tense, or by pointing, etc. (1950a:\n 121\u2013126).[10]\n\nWith this machinery in place, Austin continues:\n\n\nA statement is said to be true when the historic state of affairs [or\ne.g., situation, thing, event] to which it is correlated by the\ndemonstrative conventions (the one to which it \u201crefers\u201d)\nis of a type [footnote omitted] with which the sentence used in making\nit is correlated by the descriptive conventions. (1950a: 122)\n\n\nWhat does \u201cis of a type with which\u201d mean? Austin expands\non his account in the omitted footnote:\n\n\n\u201cIs of a type with which\u201d means \u201cis sufficiently\nlike those standard states of affairs with which\u201d. Thus, for a\nstatement to be true one state of affairs must be like\ncertain others, which is a natural relation, but also\nsufficiently like to merit the same\n\u201cdescription\u201d, which is no longer a purely natural\nrelation. To say \u201cThis is red\u201d is not the same as to say\n\u201cThis is like those\u201d, nor even as to say \u201cThis is\nlike those which were called red\u201d. That things are\nsimilar, or even \u201cexactly\u201d similar, I may\nliterally see, but that they are the same I cannot literally\nsee\u2014in calling them the same colour a convention is involved\nadditional to the conventional choice of the name to be given to the\ncolour which they are said to be. (1950a: 122 fn.2)\n\n\nThe English sentence \u201cThis is red\u201d is correlated by the\ndescriptive conventions with a type of way for things to be: a type\ninstanced by all and only those historic situations or states of\naffairs in which a selected thing is red. According to Austin, a\nstating by use of that sentence would be correct if the thing selected\nin the stating via the demonstrative conventions were sufficiently\nlike standard situations or states of affairs in which a selected\nthing is red. So, we rely on the existence of a range of standard\ninstances that are assumed to be of the required type. We can see that\nthe thing selected in this stating, via the demonstrative conventions,\nis now in various ways similar and dissimilar from those standard\ninstances. The question we need to answer is this: Is this thing of\nthe same type as the standard instances with respect to its\ncolour? That is, is it the same colour as they are? According to\nAustin, we cannot answer that question simply by looking. In an at\nleast attenuated sense we must make a decision as to whether the\npresent instance is, in relevant respects, sufficiently\nsimilar to the standard instances as to mandate treating it as of the\nvery same\n type.[11]\n\nNotice that, on Austin\u2019s view, states of affairs (etc.) do not\nper se mandate that they belong to one or another type. To\nthat extent, they do not alone determine which propositional\nstatements are true of them. The things to which true statings\ncorrespond, then, are (in at least that sense) particulars\n (see (2) above).\n The things to which statings correspond, then, appear to be quite\ndifferent from facts as the latter are commonly understood by\nphilosophers. For facts are often thought of as\nproposition-like\u2014as exhaustively captured by instances of the\nform \u201cThe fact that p\u201d. And it seems that\nelements of that type would mandate the correctness of one or another\nclassification. Austin\u2019s views about facts are developed a bit\nmore fully in his \u201cUnfair to Facts\u201d (1954ms). There Austin\nmakes clear, first, that he uses \u201cfacts\u201d, with\netymological precedent, to speak of particulars. Second, Austin\nsketches a view of propositional fact talk on which it is used as a\nway of indirectly denoting particulars as the elements that make the\nspecified propositions true. However, Austin\u2019s basic account of\ntruth can for the most part be detached from his views about facts and\n fact-talk.[12]\n\nThe role for human judgment or decision in mediating the\nclassification of particulars leaves open that their correct\nclassification as to type might vary depending on specific features of\nthe occasion for so classifying them\n (see (4) above).\n It may be, for example, that for certain purposes an historic state\nof affairs involving a rose is sufficiently like standard situations\ninvolving red things as to warrant sameness of classification, while\nfor different purposes its likeness is outweighed by its\ndissimilarities from the standard cases. Moreover, what are counted as\nstandard cases may vary with the purposes operative in attempting to\nclassify, and may shift as new cases come to be counted as of a\nspecific\n type.[13]\n\nThe precise ways in which our statings depend for their correctness or\nincorrectness on the facts can vary with variation in specific\nfeatures of the occasion, in particular with variation in the intents\nand purposes of conversational participants. As Austin puts it,\n\n\nIt seems to be fairly generally realized nowadays that, if you just\ntake a bunch of sentences\u2026impeccably formulated in some\nlanguage or other, there can be no question of sorting them out into\nthose that are true and those that are false; for (leaving out of\naccount so-called \u201canalytic\u201d sentences) the question of\ntruth and falsehood does not turn only on what a sentence is,\nnor yet on what it means, but on, speaking very broadly, the\n\ncircumstances in which it is uttered. Sentences as such are\nnot either true or false. (1962a: 110\u2013111. See also 40\u201341,\n65)\n\n\nAnd the circumstances can matter in a variety of ways, not simply by\nsupplying, or failing to supply, an appropriate array of facts:\n\n\n\u2026in the case of stating truly or falsely, just as in the case\nof advising well or badly, the intents and purposes of the utterance\nand its context are important; what is judged true in a school book\nmay not be so judged in a work of historical research. Consider\n\u2026 \u201cLord Raglan won the battle of Alma\u201d, remembering\nthat Alma was a soldier\u2019s battle if ever there was one and that\nLord Raglan\u2019s orders were never transmitted to some of his\nsubordinates. Did Lord Raglan then win the battle of Alma or did he\nnot? Of course in some contexts, perhaps in a school book, it is\nperfectly justifiable to say so\u2014it is something of an\nexaggeration, maybe, and there would be no question of giving Raglan a\nmedal for it\u2026\u201cLord Raglan won the battle of Alma\u201d\nis exaggerated and suitable to some contexts and not to others; it\nwould be pointless to insist on its [i.e., the\nsentence\u2019s] truth or falsehood. (1962b: 143\u2013144,\ninterpolation added)\n\n\nIt\u2019s important here to separate two questions. First, is the\nsentence \u201cLord Raglan won the battle of Alma\u201d\ntrue? Second, is what is stated in using that sentence on a\nparticular occasion, true? In order for the first question to get an\naffirmative answer, every use of the sentence would have to\nbe\u2014or issue in a statement that\n is\u2014true.[14]\n But although the sentence can be used in a schoolbook to make a\nstatement that is true, it might also be used in a work of historical\nresearch, or in support of Raglan\u2019s decoration, in making a\nfalse statement. Hence, the sentence doesn\u2019t take the same\ntruth-value on every occasion: the sentence per se\nis neither true nor false. By contrast, there is no reason to deny\nthat the things that are stated in using the sentence on occasions are\ntrue: in particular, there is no reason to deny that what is stated by\nthe schoolbook occurrence of the sentence is true. So, the second\nquestion can be given an affirmative answer, as long as we are willing\nto allow that a sentence can be used to make different statements on\ndifferent occasions (see also Austin\u2019s discussion of\n\u201creal\u201d in Sense and Sensibilia (1962a:\n62\u201377) for an array of relevant examples).\n\nWe should avoid a possible misunderstanding of Austin here. His\nargument shows, at most, that whatever combines with the facts to\ndetermine a particular truth-value varies from occasion to occasion.\nThat does nothing to dislodge the natural view that a sentence can\ncarry its meaning with it from occasion to occasion, and thus\npossess a literal meaning. However, if we wish to retain that idea, we\nmust give up on the idea that sentence meaning simply combines with\nthe facts that are being spoken about to determine truth-value: we\nmust reject the idea that sentence meanings determine\ntruth-conditions. Plausibly, we should also give up the idea that\nmeaning alone determines what is stated (at least insofar as the\nlatter determines truth-conditions). In taking this line, we would\nreject views of meaning according to which it is given by appeal to\n truth-conditions.[15]\n\nAustin\u2019s account gives rise to the possibility of utterances in\nwhich no truth-evaluable statement is produced:\n\n\nSuppose that we confront \u201cFrance is hexagonal\u201d with the\nfacts, in this case, I suppose, with France, is it true or false?\nWell, if you like, up to a point; of course I can see what you mean by\nsaying that it is true for certain intents and purposes. It is good\nenough for a top-ranking general, perhaps, but not for a\ngeographer\u2026 How can one answer this question, whether it is\ntrue or false that France is hexagonal? It is just rough, and that is\nthe right and final answer to the question of the relation of\n\u201cFrance is hexagonal\u201d to France. It is a rough\ndescription; it is not a true or a false one. (1962b: 143)\n\n\nWhat Austin characterises in his final denial is the sentence\n\u201cFrance is hexagonal\u201d, in relation to France. He\nneedn\u2019t, and doesn\u2019t, deny that on occasion, for\nparticular intents and purposes, one might use the sentence to\nstate a truth. However, he suggests that, in some cases, the\ncircumstances of utterance may be such that no truth-evaluable\nstatement is made by the use of a sentence.\n\nSuppose, for example, that someone uttered \u201cFrance is\nhexagonal\u201d out of the blue, without making manifest any intents\nand purposes. In that case, there would be nothing to go on, in\nseeking to establish whether the utterance was true or false, other\nthan the words used, given their meanings. But those words might have\nbeen used to make a variety of statements, statements whose truth or\nfalsehood depends on the facts in a variety of ways. Hence, unless we\nare willing to allow that the utterance is both true and false, we\nshould withhold that mode of assessment: although such an utterance\nwould involve a perfectly meaningful sentence, it would fail\nto be either true or false. Austin thought that our uses of words are\nalways liable to that sort of failure, especially when we are doing\nphilosophy. When used in cases that are out of the ordinary, or in the\nabsence of the background required to sustain the statement of truths\nor falsehoods, words might\u2014in that sense\u2014fail us.\n\nAustin makes no claims to generality for the account of truth that he\nsketches. However, it\u2019s natural to wonder to what extent the\naccount can naturally be extended in order to take in types of\nstatement that he doesn\u2019t explicitly attempt to bring within its\npurview. Potential pressure points here include statements whose\nexpression involves negation (see 1950a: 128\u2013129, 129 fn.1),\nquantification (see 1962b: 144), or conditionals, and statements of\nnecessary truths. The three main options open to the defender of\nAustin here are the following. First, an attempt might be made to\nbring some cases within the purview of a natural generalization of\nAustin\u2019s account (see, for example, Warnock 1989: 56\u201361).\nSecond, it might be allowed that some such cases require distinctive\ntreatment, but argued that they can still be connected with the\naccount Austin offers as further species of the truth-genus. Third, an\nattempt might be made to argue that some such cases are so distinctive\nthat the forms of positive appraisal that are appropriate to them are\nnot really forms of appraisal as to\n truth.[16]\n\nLet\u2019s turn to\n (5),\n the question of the extent to which Austin endorses a deflationary\naccount of truth. The promiscuity of the classifier\n\u201cdeflationist\u201d has a tendency to render the question\ndifficult to discuss in a useful way. However, we can at least\nconsider some ways in which Austin might be thought to give an\nexplanatory role to truth, or to deny it such a role. It\u2019s clear\nthat Austin wishes to reject Strawson\u2019s very strong form of\ndeflationism, according to which the function of truth is exhaustively\nperformative: saying that a statement is true amounts, precisely, to\nendorsing that statement oneself. Moreover, there is no sign that\nAustin thinks an account can be given of the expression of statements\nby statings that isn\u2019t bound up with consideration of the\nconditions in which their stating would be subject to one or another\nform of positive appraisal\u2014at the most general level,\nconsideration of their correctness-conditions. However, Austin often\ncharacterizes truth and falsity themselves as, in effect, mere labels\nfor positive and negative poles, respectively, in a variety of more\nspecific forms of appraisal.\n\n\nWe become obsessed with \u201ctruth\u201d when discussing\nstatements, just as we become obsessed with \u201cfreedom\u201d when\ndiscussing conduct. So long as we think that what has always and alone\nto be decided is whether a certain action was done freely or was not,\nwe get nowhere: but so soon as we turn instead to the numerous other\nadverbs used in the same connexion (\u201caccidentally\u201d,\n\u201cunwillingly\u201d, \u201cinadvertently\u201d, &c.),\nthings become easier, and we come to see that no concluding inference\nof the form \u201cErgo, it was done freely (or not freely)\u201d is\nrequired. Like freedom, truth is a bare minimum or an illusory ideal\n(the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth about, say, the\nbattle of Waterloo or the Primavera). (1950a: 130; see also\n1956b: 250\u2013251, 1957: 180)\n\n\nAustin\u2019s idea here seems to be the following. There are numerous\nspecific forms of positive appraisal that we employ with respect to\nstatings: they might be fair, reasonable, accurate, precise, adequate,\nsatisfactory and so forth. (Recall that Austin would have taken each\nform of assessment to be occasion-bound: a matter, for example, of\nwhat would be fair and reasonable to judge on this particular\noccasion.) In saying that what is stated in a stating is\ntrue, we are in effect saying that the stating meets the\n\u201cbare minimum\u201d condition of being susceptible to one or\nanother of those specific forms of positive appraisal. It\u2019s\nconsistent with this type of view that our conception of the natures\nof what we state, and of how our statings come to be expressions of\nthose things, is bound up with our conception of the conditions in\nwhich our statings, and what we thereby state, are susceptible to one\nor another form of positive appraisal. To that extent, it differs from\nsome stronger forms of deflationism on which no truth-related mode of\npositive appraisal plays a non-derivative explanatory role. Moreover,\nthe view can take more or less radical forms. Its most radical form\ntreats truth as a mere disjunction of the more specific modes of\npositive appraisal, with no uniform underlying commonality amongst\nthose specific modes. That view would be a distinctive form of\ndeflationism about truth, since it would reject the idea that truth\nper se plays an essential role in explanation. Its less\nradical form allows that truth might impose a uniform necessary\ncondition on the specific modes of positive appraisal, and thereby\nplay an essential role, through its government of the specific modes,\nin the explanation of what is stated in statings. The latter form of\nview wouldn\u2019t count as an interesting form of\ndeflationism, although it might well be an interesting\nposition in its own right.\n\nAustin discusses an important range of ways in which assessment as to\ntruth can cover a variety of more fine-grained modes of appraisal in\nhis \u201cHow to Talk\u201d (1953). See also the discussions of this\npaper in Chisholm 1964 and Warnock 1989: 47\u201356.\n\n(For discussion of Austin\u2019s account of truth, see Barwise and\nEtchemendy 1987; Bennett 1966; Crary 2002; Davidson 1969; Grice 1989:\n3\u201340; Hansen 2014; Kirkham 1995: 124\u2013140; Mates 1974;\nNarboux 2011; Putnam 1994; Recanati 1994: 1\u20135, 121\u2013130,\n141\u2013153; Searle 1966; Strawson 1950, 1965; Travis 1991, 2005,\n2008: 1\u201318, 2011; Warnock 1973c, 1989: 45\u201364,\n135\u2013145, 163\u20134 fn.74; White 1967; C.J.F.
