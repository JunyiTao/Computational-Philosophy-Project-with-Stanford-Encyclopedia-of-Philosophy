    "main_text": "Five Problems || The problem of the application of mathematics\n2.2 The problem of the application of mathematics\nMathematics is often successfully used in scientific theories. How\ncan such a success be explained? Platonists allegedly have an answer\nto this problem. Given that mathematical objects exist and are\nsuccessfully referred to by our scientific theories, it is not\nsurprising that such theories are successful. Reference to\nmathematical objects is just part of the reference to those entities\nthat are indispensable to our best theories of the world. This frames\nthe problem of the application of mathematics in terms of the\nindispensability argument.\nIn fact, one of the main reasons for belief in the existence of\nmathematical objects\u2014some claim this is the only\nnon-question begging reason (Field 1980)\u2014is given by the\nindispensable use of mathematics in science. The crucial idea,\noriginally put forward by W. V. Quine, and later articulated, in a\ndifferent way, by Hilary Putnam, is that ontological commitment should\nbe restricted to just those entities that are indispensable to our\nbest theories of the world (Quine 1960; Putnam 1971; Colyvan\n2001a). Mark Colyvan has formulated the argument in the following\nterms:\n\n(P1) We ought to be ontologically committed to all and only those\n  entities that are indispensable to our best theories of the\n  world.\n(P2) Mathematical entities are indispensable to our best theories\n  of the world.\nTherefore, (C) we ought to be ontologically committed to\n  mathematical entities.\n\nThe first premise relies crucially on Quine's criterion of\nontological commitment. After regimenting our best theories of the\nworld in a first-order language, the ontological commitments of these\ntheories can be read off as being the value of the existentially\nquantified variables. But how do we move from the ontological\ncommitments of a theory to what we ought to be ontologically\ncommitted to? This is the point where the first premise of the\nindispensability argument emerges. If we are dealing with our best\ntheories of the world, precisely those items that are indispensable to\nthese theories amount to what we ought to be committed\nto. (Of course, a theory may quantify over more objects than those\nthat are indispensable.) And by identifying the indispensable\ncomponents invoked in the explanation of various phenomena, and noting\nthat mathematical entities are among them, the platonist is then in a\nposition to make sense of the success of applied mathematics.\nHowever, it turns out that whether the platonist can indeed explain\nthe success of the application of mathematics is, in fact,\ncontroversial. Given that mathematical objects are abstract, it is\nunclear why the postulation of such entities is helpful to understand\nthe success of applied mathematics. For the physical world\u2014being\ncomposed of objects located in space-time\u2014is not constituted by\nthe entities postulated by the platonist. Hence, it is not clear why\nthe correct description of relations among abstract\n(mathematical) entities is even relevant to understand the\nbehavior of concrete objects in the physical world involved in the\napplication of mathematics. Just mentioning that the physical\nworld instantiates structures (or substructures) described in\ngeneral terms by various mathematical theories is not enough (see,\ne.g., Shapiro 1997). For there are infinitely many mathematical\nstructures, and there is no way of uniquely determining which of them\nis actually instantiated\u2014or even instantiated only in\npart\u2014in a finite region of the physical world. There is a\ngenuine underdetermination here, given that the same physical\nstructure in the world can be accommodated by very different\nmathematical structures. For instance, quantum mechanical phenomena\ncan be characterized by group-theoretic structures (Weyl 1928) or by\nstructures emerging from the theory of Hilbert spaces (von Neumann\n1932). Mathematically, such structures are very different, but there\nis no way of deciding between them empirically.\nDespite the controversial nature of the platonist claim to be able\nto explain the success of applied mathematics, to accommodate that\nsuccess is often taken as a significant benefit of platonism. Less\ncontroversially, the platonist is certainly able to describe the way\nin which mathematical theories are actually used in scientific\npractice without having to rewrite them. This is, as will become clear\nbelow, a significant benefit of the view.\nNominalism, in turn, faces the difficulty of having to explain the\nsuccessful use of mathematics in scientific theorizing. Since,\naccording to the nominalist, mathematical objects do not\nexist\u2014or, at least, are not taken to exist\u2014it becomes\nunclear how referring to such entities can contribute to the empirical\nsuccess of scientific theories. In particular, if it turns out that\nreference to mathematical entities is indeed indispensable to our best\ntheories of the world, how can the nominalist deny the existence of\nsuch entities? As we will see below, several nominalist views in the\nphilosophy of mathematics have emerged in response to the challenge\nraised by considerations based on the indispensability of\nmathematics.\n",
