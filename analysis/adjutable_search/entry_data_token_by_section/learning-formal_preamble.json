    "main_text": "\n\nFormal learning theory is the mathematical embodiment of a normative\nepistemology. It deals with the question of how an agent should use\nobservations about her environment to arrive at correct and\ninformative conclusions. Philosophers such as Putnam, Glymour and\nKelly have developed learning theory as a normative framework for\nscientific reasoning and inductive inference.\n\nTerminology. Cognitive science and related fields typically\nuse the term \u201clearning\u201d for the process of gaining\ninformation through observation\u2014 hence the name \u201clearning\ntheory\u201d. To most cognitive scientists, the term \u201clearning\ntheory\u201d suggests the empirical study of human and animal\nlearning stemming from the behaviourist paradigm in psychology. The\nepithet \u201cformal\u201d distinguishes the subject of this entry\nfrom behaviourist learning theory. Philosophical terms for\nlearning-theoretic epistemology include \u201clogical\nreliability\u201d (Kelly [1996], Glymour [1991]) and\n\u201cmeans-ends epistemology\u201d (Schulte [1999]).\n\nBecause many developments in, and applications of, formal learning\ntheory come from computer science, the term \u201ccomputational\nlearning theory\u201d is also common. Many results on learning theory\nin computer science are concerned with Valiant\u2019s and\nVapnik\u2019s notion of learning generalizations that are probably\napproximately correct (PAC learning) (Valiant [1984]). This notion of\nempirical success was introduced to philosophers by Gilbert Harmann in\nhis Nicode lectures, and elaborated in a subsequent book [2007].\nValiant himself provides an accessible account of PAC learning and its\nrelationship to the problem of induction in a recent book (Valiant\n[2013, Ch. 5]). The present article describes a nonstatistical\ntradition of learning theory stemming from the seminal work of Hilary\nPutnam [1963] and Mark E. Gold [1967]. Recent research has extended\nthe reliabilist means-ends approach to a statistical setting where\ninductive methods assign probabilities to statistical hypotheses from\nrandom samples. The new statistical framework is described at the end\nof this entry, in the Section on\n Reliable Statistical Inquiry.\n\n\nPhilosophical characteristics. In contrast to other\nphilosophical approaches to inductive inference, learning theory does\nnot aim to describe a universal inductive method or explicate general\naxioms of inductive rationality. Rather, learning theory pursues a\ncontext-dependent means-ends analysis [Steele 2010]: For a given\nempirical problem and a set of cognitive goals, what is the best\nmethod for achieving the goals? Most of learning theory examines \nwhich investigative strategies reliably and efficiently lead to\ncorrect beliefs about the world.\n\nArticle Overview. Compared to traditional philosphical\ndiscussions of inductive inference, learning theory provides a\nradically new way of thinking about induction and scientific method.\nThe main aim of this article is explain the main concepts of the\ntheory through examples. Running examples are repeated throughout the\nentry; at the same time, the sections are meant to be as independent\nof each other as possible. We use the examples to illustrate some\ntheorems of philosophical interest, and to highlight the key\nphilosophical ideas and insights behind learning theory.\n\nReaders interested in the mathematical substance of learning theory\nwill find some references in the\n Bibliography,\n and a summary of the basic definitions in the\n Supplementary Document.\n A text by Jain et al. collects many of the main definitions and\ntheorems [1999]. New results appear in proceedings of annual\nconferences, such as the Conferences on Learning Theory (COLT) and\nAlgorithmic Learning Theory (ALT). The philosophical issues and\nmotivation pertaining to learning-theoretic epistemology are discussed\nextensively in the works of philosophers such as Putnam, Glymour and\nKelly (Putnam [1963], Glymour [1991], Glymour and Kelly [1992], Kelly\n[1996]).\n",
