    "main_text": "Dynamical Systems\n1. Dynamical Systems\n\nThe object of study in ergodic theory is a dynamical system. We first\nintroduce some basic concepts with a simple example, from which we\nabstract the general definition of a dynamical system. For a brief\nhistory of the modern notion of a dynamical system and the associated\nconcepts of EH see the\n Appendix,\n Section A.\n\nA lead ball is hanging from the ceiling on a spring. We then pull it\ndown a bit and let it go. The ball begins to oscillate. The mechanical\nstate of the ball is completely determined by a specification of the\nposition \\(x\\) and the momentum \\(p\\) of its center of mass; that is,\nif we know \\(x\\) and \\(p\\), then we know all that there is to know\nabout the mechanical state of the ball. If we now conjoin \\(x\\) and\n\\(p\\) in one vector space we obtain the so-called phase space\n\\(X\\) of the system (sometimes also referred to as \u2018state\n space\u2019).[1]\n This is illustrated in Figure 1 for a two-dimensional phase space of\nthe state of a ball moving up and down (i.e., the phase space has one\ndimension for the ball\u2019s position and one for its momentum).\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The motion of a ball on a\nspring.\n\n\nEach point of \\(X\\) represents a state of the ball (because it gives\nthe ball\u2019s position and momentum). Accordingly, the time\nevolution of the ball\u2019s state is represented by a line in \\(X\\),\na so-called phase space trajectory (from now on\n\u2018trajectory\u2019), showing where in phase space the system was\nat each instant of time. For instance, let us assume that at time \\(t\n= 0\\) the ball is located at point \\(x_1\\) and then moves to \\(x_2\\)\nwhere it arrives at time \\(t = 5\\). This motion is represented in\n\\(X\\) by the line segment connecting points \\(\\gamma_1\\) and\n\\(\\gamma_2\\). In other words, the motion of the ball is represented in\n\\(X\\) by the motion of a point representing the ball\u2019s\n(instantaneous) state, and all the states that the ball is in over the\ncourse of a certain period of time jointly form a trajectory. The\nmotion of this point has a name: it is the phase flow\n\\(\\phi_t\\). The phase flow tells us where the ball is at some later\ntime \\(t\\) if we specify where it is at \\(t = 0\\); or, metaphorically\nspeaking, \\(\\phi_t\\) drags the ball\u2019s state around in \\(X\\) so\nthat the movement of the state represents the motion of the real ball.\nIn other words, \\(\\phi_t\\) is a mathematical representation of the\nsystem\u2019s time evolution. The state of the ball at time \\(t = 0\\)\nis commonly referred to as the initial condition. \\(\\phi_t\\)\nthen tells us, for every point in phase space, how this point evolves\nif it is chosen as an initial condition. In our concrete example, point\n\\(\\gamma_1\\) is the initial condition and we have \\(\\gamma_2 =\n\\phi_{t=5}(\\gamma_1)\\). More generally, let us call the ball\u2019s\ninitial condition \\(\\gamma_0\\) and let \\(\\gamma(t)\\) be its state at\nsome later time \\(t\\). Then we have \\(\\gamma(t) = \\phi_t (\\gamma_0)\\).\nThis is illustrated in figure 2a.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Evolution in Phase space.\n\n\nSince \\(\\phi_t\\) tells us for every point in \\(X\\) how it evolves in\ntime, it also tells us how sets of points move around. For instance,\nchoose an arbitrary set \\(A\\) in \\(X\\); then \\(\\phi_t (A)\\) is the\nimage of A after \\(t\\) time units under the dynamics of the\nsystem. This is illustrated in Figure 2b. Considering sets of points\nrather than single points is important when we think about physical\napplications of this mathematical formalism. We can never determine\nthe exact initial condition of a ball bouncing on a spring. No matter\nhow precisely we measure \\(\\gamma_0\\), there will always be some\nmeasurement error. So what we really want to know in practical\napplications is not how a precise mathematical point evolves, but\nrather how a set of points around the initial condition \\(\\gamma_0\\)\nevolves. In our example with the ball the evolution is\n\u2018tame\u2019, in that the set keeps its original shape. As we\nwill see below, this is not always the case.\n\nAn important feature of \\(X\\) is that it is endowed with a so-called\nmeasure \\(\\mu\\). We are familiar with measures in many\ncontexts: from a mathematical point of view, the length that we\nattribute to a part of a line, the surface we attribute to a part of a\nplane, and the volume we attribute to a segment of space are measures.\nA measure is simply a device to attribute a \u2018size\u2019 to a\npart of a space. Although \\(X\\) is an abstract mathematical space, the\nleading idea of a measure remains the same: it is a tool to quantify\nthe size of a set. So we say that the set \\(A\\) has measure \\(\\mu(A)\\)\nin much the same way as we say that a certain collection of points of\nordinary space (for instance the ones that lie on the inside of a\nbottle) have a certain volume (for instance one litre).\n\nFrom a more formal point of view, a measure assigns numbers to certain\nsubsets of a set \\(X\\) (see Appendix B for a formal definition). This\ncan be done in different ways and hence there are different measures.\nConsider the example of a plane. There is a measure that simply\nassigns to each appropriate region of a plane the area of that region.\nBut now imagine that we pour a bucket of sugar on the plane. The sugar\nis not evenly distributed; there are little heaps in some places while\nthere is almost no sugar in other places. A measure different from the\narea measure is one that assigns to a region a number that is equal to\nthe amount of sugar on that region. One of these measures is\nparticularly important, namely the so-called Lebesgue\nmeasure. This measure has an intuitive interpretation: it is just\na precise formalisation of the measure we commonly use in geometry.\nThe interval [0, 2] has Lebesgue measure 2 and the interval [3, 4] has\nLebegues measure 1. In two dimensions, a square whose sides have\nLebesgue measure 2 has Lebesgue measure 4; etc. Although this sounds\nsimple, the mathematical theory of measures is rather involved. We\nstate the basics of measure theory in the\n Appendix,\n Section B, and avoid appeal to technical issues in measure theory in\nwhat follows.\n\nThe essential elements in the discussion so far were the phase space\n\\(X\\), the time evolution \\(\\phi_t\\), and the measure \\(\\mu\\). And\nthese are also the ingredients for the definition of an abstract\ndynamical system. An abstract dynamical system is a triple \\([X, \\mu ,\nT_t]\\), where \\(\\{T_t \\mid t \\text{ is an instant of time}\\}\\) is a\nfamily of automorphisms, i.e., a family of transformations of \\(X\\)\nonto itself with the property that \\(T_{t_1 +t_2} = T_{t_1}(T_{t_2})\\)\nfor all \\(x \\in X\\) (Arnold and Avez 1968, 1); we say more about time\n below.[2]\n In the above example \\(X\\) is the phase space of the ball\u2019s\nmotion, \\(\\mu\\) is the Lebesgue measure, and \\(T_t\\) is\n\\(\\phi_t\\).\n\nSo far we have described \\(T_t\\) as giving the time evolution of a\nsystem. Now let us look at this from a more mathematical point of\nview: the effect of \\(T_t\\) is that it assigns to every point in \\(X\\)\nanother point in \\(X\\) after \\(t\\) time units have elapsed. In the\nabove example \\(\\gamma_1\\) is mapped onto \\(\\gamma_2\\) under\n\\(\\phi_t\\) after \\(t = 5\\) seconds. Hence, from a mathematical point\nof view the time evolution of a system consists in a mapping of \\(X\\)\nonto itself, which is why the above definition takes \\(T_t\\) to be a\nfamily of mappings of \\(X\\) onto itself. Such a mapping is a\nprescription that tells you for every point \\(x\\) in \\(X\\) on which\nother point in \\(X\\) it is mapped (from now on we use \\(x\\) to denote\nany point in \\(X\\), and it no longer stands, as in the above example,\nfor the position of the ball). \n\nThe systems studied in ergodic theory are forward deterministic. This\nmeans that if two identical copies of that system are in the same\nstate at one instant of time, then they must be in the same\nstate at all future instants of time. Intuitively speaking,\nthis means that for any given time there is only one way in which the\nsystem can evolve forward. For a discussion of determinism see Earman\n(1986).\n\nIt should be pointed out that no particular interpretation is intended\nin an abstract dynamical system. We have motivated the definition with\nan example from mechanics, but dynamical systems are not tied to that\ncontext. They are mathematical objects in their own right, and as such\nthey can be studied independently of particular applications. This\nmakes them a versatile tool in many different domains. In fact,\ndynamical systems are used, among others, in fields as diverse as\nphysics, biology, geology and economics. \n\nThere are many different kinds of dynamical systems. The three most\nimportant distinctions are the following.\n\nDiscrete versus continuous time. We may consider discrete\ninstants of time or a continuum of instants of time. For ease of\npresentation, we shall say in the first case that time is discrete and\nin the second case that time is continuous. This is just a convenient\nterminology that has no implications for whether time is fundamentally\ndiscrete or continuous. In the above example with the ball time was\ncontinuous (it was taken to be a real number). But often it is\nconvenient to regard time as discrete. If time is continuous, then\n\\(t\\) is a real number and the family of automorphisms is \\(\\{T_t \\mid\nt \\in \\mathbb{R} \\}\\), where \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) is the set of real numbers. If time is\ndiscrete, then \\(t\\) is in the set \\(\\mathbb{Z} = \\{\\ldots -2, -1, 0,\n1, 2, \\ldots \\}\\), and the family of automorphisms is \\(\\{T_t \\mid t\n\\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}\\). In order to indicate that we are dealing with a\ndiscrete family rather than a continuous one we sometimes replace\n\u2018\\(T_t\\)\u2019 with \u2018\\(T_n\\)\u2019; this is just a\nnotational convention of no conceptual\n importance.[3]\n In such systems the progression from one instant of time to the next\nis also referred to as a \u2018step\u2019. In population biology,\nfor instance, we often want to know how a population grows over a\ntypical breeding time (e.g. one year). In mathematical models of such\na population the points in \\(X\\) represent the size of a population\n(rather than the position and the momentum of a ball, as in the above\nexample), and the transformation \\(T_n\\) represents the growth of the\npopulation after \\(n\\) time units. A simple example would be \\(T_n = x\n+ n\\).\n\nDiscrete families of automorphisms have the interesting property that\nthey are generated by one mapping. As we have seen above, all\nautomorphisms satisfy \\(T_{t_1 +t_2} = T_{t_1}(T_{t_2})\\). From this\nit follows that \\(T_n (x) = T^{n}_1 (x)\\), that is \\(T_n\\) is the\n\\(n\\)-th iterate of \\(T_1\\). In this sense \\(T_1\\) generates \\(\\{T_t\n\\mid t \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}\\); or, in other words, \\(\\{T_t \\mid t \\in\n\\mathbb{Z}\\}\\) can be \u2018reduced\u2019 to \\(T_1\\). For this\nreason one often drops the subscript \u20181\u2019, simply calls the\nmap \u2018\\(T\\)\u2019, and writes the dynamical system as the triple\n\\([X, \\mu , T]\\), where it is understood that \\(T = T_1\\).\n\nFor ease of presentation we use discrete transformations from now on.\nThe definitions and theorems we formulate below carry over to\ncontinuous transformations without further ado, and where this is not\nthe case we explicitly say so and treat the two cases separately.\n\nMeasure preserving versus non-measure preserving\ntransformations. Roughly speaking, a transformation is measure\npreserving if the size of a set (like set \\(A\\) in the above example)\ndoes not change over the course of time: a set can change its form but\nit cannot shrink or grow (with respect to the measure). Formally,\n\\(T\\) is a measure-preserving transformation on \\(X\\) if and\nonly if (iff) for all sets \\(A\\) in \\(X: \\mu(A) = \\mu(T^{-1}(A))\\),\nwhere \\(T^{-1}(A)\\) is the set of points that gets mapped onto \\(A\\)\nunder \\(T\\); that is \\(T^{-1}(A) = \\{ x \\in X \\mid T(x) \\in A\n \\}\\).[4]\n From now on we also assume that the transformations we consider are\nmeasure\n preserving.[5]\n\nIn sum, from now on, unless stated otherwise, we consider discrete\nmeasure preserving transformations.\n\nIn order to introduce the concept of ergodicity we have to introduce\nthe phase and the time mean of a function \\(f\\) on \\(X\\).\nMathematically speaking, a function assigns each point in \\(X\\) a\nnumber. If the numbers are always real the function is a real-valued\nfunction; and if the numbers may be complex, then it is a\ncomplex-valued function. Intuitively we can think of these numbers as\nrepresenting the physical quantities of interest. Recalling the\nexample of the bouncing ball, \\(f\\) could for instance assign each\npoint in the phase space \\(X\\) the kinetic energy the system has at\nthat point; in this case we would have \\(f = p^2 / 2m\\), where \\(m\\)\nis the mass of the ball. For every function we can take two kinds of\naverages. The first is the infinite time average \\(f^*\\). The general\nidea of a time average is familiar from everyday contexts. You play\nthe lottery on three consecutive Saturdays. On the first you win $10;\non the second you win nothing; and on the third you win $50. Your\naverage gain is ($10 + $0 + $50)/3 = $20. Technically speaking this is\na time average. This simple idea can easily be put to use in a\ndynamical system: follow the system\u2019s evolution over time (and\nremember that we are now talking about an average for discrete points\nof time), take the value of the relevant function at each step, add\nthe values, and then divide by the number of steps. This yields\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} f(T_i(x_0)),\n\\]\n\n\nwhere \n\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} f(T_i(x_0)),\n\\]\n\n\nis just an abbreviation for \n\n\\[\nf(x_0) + f(T_1 x_0) + \\ldots + f(T_{k-1}x_0).\n\\]\n\n\nThis is the finite time average for \\(f\\) after \\(k\\) steps. If the\nsystem\u2019s state continues to evolve infinitely and we keep\ntracking the system forever, then we get the infinite time\naverage: \n\n\\[\nf^* = \\lim_{k \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} f(T_i(x_0)),\n\\]\n\n\nwhere the symbol \u2018lim\u2019 (from latin \u2018limes\u2019,\nmeaning border or limit) indicates that we are letting time tend\ntowards infinity (in mathematical symbols: \\(\\infty)\\). One point\ndeserves special attention, since it will become crucial later on: the\npresence of \\(x_0\\) in the above expression. Time averages depend on\nwhere the system starts; i.e., they depend on the initial condition.\nIf the process starts in a different state, the time average may well\nbe different.\n\nNext we have the space average \\(\\bar{f}\\). Let us again start with a\ncolloquial example: the average height of the students in a particular\nschool. This is easily calculated: just take each student\u2019s\nheight, add up all the numbers, and divide the result by the number of\nstudents. Technically speaking this is a space average. In\nthe example the students in the school correspond to the points in\n\\(X\\); and the fact that we count each students once (we don\u2019t,\nfor instance, take John\u2019s height into account twice and omit\nJim\u2019s) corresponds to the choice of a measure that gives equal\n\u2018weight\u2019 to each point in \\(X\\). The transformation \\(T\\)\nhas no pendant in our example, and this is deliberate: space averages\nhave nothing to do with the dynamics of the system (that\u2019s what\nsets them off from time averages). The general mathematical definition\nof the space average is as follows: \n\n\\[\n\\bar{f} = \\int_x f(x)d\\mu ,\n\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(\\int_X\\) is the integral over the phase space\n \\(X\\).[6]\n If the space consists of discrete elements, like the students of the\nschool (they are \u2018discrete\u2019 in that you can count them),\nthen the integral becomes equivalent to a sum like the one we have\nwhen we determine the average height of a population. If the \\(X\\) is\ncontinuous (as the phase space above) things are a bit more\ninvolved.\n",
