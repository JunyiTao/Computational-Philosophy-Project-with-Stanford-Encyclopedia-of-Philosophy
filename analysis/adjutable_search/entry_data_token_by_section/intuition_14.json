    "main_text": "Experimental Philosophy and Intuitions || The Nature of Experimental Philosophy\n4.1 The Nature of Experimental Philosophy\n\nIn the last ten to fifteen years, there has been an explosion of\ninterest in research involving the scientific or empirical\ninvestigation of intuitions of philosophical interest. Such projects\nare now frequently grouped under the rubric of \u201cexperimental\nphilosophy.\u201d (For general characterizations of experimental\nphilosophy see Knobe and Nichols 2008, Appiah 2008, and Nadelhoffer\nand Nahmias 2007.) At least four broadly-individuated projects in\nexperimental philosophy can be distinguished.\n\nThe first project, \u201cthe psychology project,\u201d aims\nto discover how people ordinarily think. Knobe and Nichols claim that\nthe results of such inquiries \u201chave great philosophical\nsignificance in their own right \u2026 for traditional philosophical\nquestions\u201d (2008: 12). This claim is motivated in part by the\nidea that questions which occupied the attention of historically\nsignificant philosophers ought to count as philosophically significant\nquestions. As many philosophers of antiquity and the early modern\nperiod made various claims about human psychology, such questions, it\nis claimed, count as philosophical questions which may be better\npursued by modern psychological inquiry.\n\nThe second project, \u201cthe verification project,\u201d\naims to determine if the various propositions which philosophers\nallege to be intuitive, pre-theoretical, or \u201cpart of common\nsense\u201d are, in fact, intuitive to ordinary non-philosophers.\nThis project is motivated both by the general conviction that\nempirical claims, such as those regarding the extent to which some\nbelief or intuition is shared by others, require adequate empirical\nsupport, and by the suspicion that what philosophers find intuitive or\nregard as commonsensical may be the result of their specialized\ntraining, theoretical allegiance, or general cognitive biases\n(Nadelhoffer and Nahmias 2007: 125; Knobe and Nichols 2008: 9). An\nexample of this approach can be found in Nahmias and colleagues\u2019\ninvestigations of free will (2006, 2007).\n\nThe third project, \u201cthe sources project,\u201d aims to\ndiscover the psychological mechanisms or processes that produce\npeople\u2019s intuitions. According to Knobe and Nichols, it is\nmotivated by the \u201chope \u2026 that we can use the information\nto help determine whether the psychological sources \u2026 undercut\nthe warrant for the beliefs\u201d based upon the source (2008: 9).\nSimilarly, Allman and Woodward suggest that\n\n\nbetter understanding of the sources and character of moral intuition\nwill help to clarify whether and when it has a legitimate role in\nmoral argument. (2008: 167) \n\n\nExamples of this approach include: Greene\u2019s (Greene et al. 2001;\nGreene 2003: 848) fMRI investigations of moral judgment (criticized in\nBerker 2009), Horowitz\u2019s (1998) attempt (see also Sunstein 2005)\nto explain certain intuitions taken to support the doctrine of doing\nand allowing using Kahneman and Tversky\u2019s prospect theory\n(criticized in Kamm 1998 and van Roojen 1999), and aspects of Nichols\nand Knobe\u2019s (2007) investigations of the role of affect on\njudgments regarding the compatibility of determinism and moral\nresponsibility.\n\nThe fourth project, \u201cthe variation project,\u201d\nseeks to determine the extent of variation in intuitions between\ndifferent groups, persons or persons-at-times or persons-in-contexts.\nMany working on this project hold that the empirically discovered\nvariation in intuitions gives us reason to believe that intuitions are\nunreliable (Alexander et al. 2010). Examples of this approach (which\ntraces its main intellectual lineage back to Stich 1988) include\nWeinberg et al. (2001) on cross-cultural variation in intuitions about\nknowledge (criticized in Sosa 2007), Swain et al. (2008) on order\neffects in intuitions about knowledge (criticized in Sosa 2007),\nBuckwalter and Stich (2013) on gender variation in intuitions of many\nsorts, and Machery et al. (2004) and Mallon et al. (2009) on\ncross-cultural variation in intuitions about reference (criticized in\nLudwig 2007; Devitt 2011; Deutsch 2009; Sytsma and Livengood\n2011).\n",
