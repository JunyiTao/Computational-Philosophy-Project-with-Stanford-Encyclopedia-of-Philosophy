Can an Evolutionist Be a Christian?\n\nTo sort out this debate, let us agree (to what is surely the case)\nthat if you are a methodological naturalist, today you are going to\naccept evolution and conversely to think that evolution supports your\ncause. Today, methodological naturalism and evolution are a package\ndeal. Take one, and you take the other. Reject one, and you reject the\nother. Clearly then, if your theism is one which gets its knowledge of\nGod\u2019s actions and purposes from a literal reading of the Bible, you\nhave got a conflict. You cannot accept Genesis literally and\nevolution. That is a fact. In other words, there can be no\naccommodation between Creationism and evolution. However, what if you\nthink that theologically speaking there is much to be said for a nice\nshade of grey? What if you think that much of the Bible, although\ntrue, should be interpreted in a metaphorical manner? What if you\nthink you can be an evolutionist, and yet take in the essential heart\nof the Bible? What price consistency and methodological naturalism\nthen? The answer depends on what you take to be the \u201cessential\nheart\u201d of the Bible. At a minimum we can say that, to the\nChristian, this heart speaks of our sinful nature, of God\u2019s sacrifice,\nand of the prospect of ultimate salvation. It speaks of the world as a\nmeaningful creation of God (however caused) and of a foreground drama\nwhich takes place within this world. One refers particularly to the\noriginal sin, Jesus\u2019 life and death, and his resurrection and anything\nwhich comes after it. And clearly at once we are plunged into the\nfirst of the big problems, namely that of miracles \u2013 those of\nJesus himself (the turning of water into wine at the marriage at\nCana), his return to life on the third day, and (especially if you are\na Catholic) such ongoing miracles as transubstantiation and those\nassociated, in response to prayer, with the intervention of saints.\n\n\nThere are a number of options here for the would-be methodological\nnaturalist. You might simply say that such miracles occurred, that\nthey did involve violations of law, but that they are outside your\nscience. They are simply exceptions to the rule. End of argument. A\nlittle abrupt, but not flatly inconsistent with calling yourself a\ntheist. You say normally God works through law but, for our salvation,\nmiracles outside law were necessary. Or you might say that miracles\noccur but that they are compatible with science, or at least not\nincompatible. Jesus was in a trance and the cure for cancer after the\nprayers to Saint Bernadette was according to rare, unknown, but\ngenuine laws. This position is less abrupt, although you might worry\nwhether this strategy is truly Christian, in letter or in spirit. It\nseems a little bit of a cheat to say that the Jesus taken down from\nthe cross was truly not dead, and the marriage at Cana starts to sound\nlike outright fraud. Of course, you can start stripping away at more\nand more miracles, downgrading them to regular occurrences blown up\nand magnified by the Apostles, but in the end this rather defeats the\nwhole purpose.\n\nThe third option is simply to refuse to get into the battle at all.\nYou argue that the law/miracle dichotomy is a false one. Miracles are\njust not the sorts of things which conflict with or confirm natural\nlaws. Traditional Christians have always argued this in some respects.\nTake the Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation. The turning of the\nbread and the wine into the body and blood of Christ is simply not\nsomething open to empirical check. You cannot disconfirm religion or\nprove science by doing an analysis of the host. Likewise even with the\nresurrection of Jesus. After the Crucifixion, his mortal body was\nirrelevant. The point was that the disciples felt Jesus in their\nhearts, and were thus emboldened to go forth and preach the gospel.\nSomething real happened to them, but it was not a physical reality\n\u2013 nor, for instance, was Paul\u2019s conversion a physical event,\neven though it changed his life and those of countless after him.\nToday\u2019s miracles also are really more a matter of the spirit than the\nflesh. Does one simply go to Lourdes in hope of a lucky lottery ticket\nto health or for the comfort that one knows one will get, even if\nthere is no physical cure? In the words of the philosophers, it is a\ncategory mistake to put miracles and laws in the same set. (Hume\n(1748, 1779) is the starting place for these discussions. Although\nsomewhat dated, Flew and MacIntyre (1955) is still invaluable.\nParadoxically, both of these then-atheist authors came to see the\nlight and returned to the Christianity of their childhoods!\nApparently, the \u201cwords of the philosophers\u201d are not\ndefinitive.)\n\nWhat has Johnson to say to all of this? Frustratingly, the answer is:\n\u201cremarkably little\u201d! In main part this stems from a\nrefusal to spell out exactly what is meant by \u201ctheism\u201d.\nWhat Johnson does say is more in the way of sneer or dismissal than\nargument.\n\nPersons who are sufficiently motivated to do so can find ways to\nresist the easy pathway from M[ethodological] N[aturalism] to atheism,\nagnosticism or deism. For example, perhaps God actively directs the\nevolutionary process but (for some inscrutable reason) does so in a\nway that is empirically imperceptible. No one can disprove that sort\nof possibility, but not many people seem to regard it as\nintellectually impressive either. That they seem to rely on\n\u201cfaith\u201d \u2014 in the sense of belief without evidence\n\u2013 is why theists are a marginalized minority in the academic\nworld and always on the defensive. Usually they protect their\nreputation for good judgment by restricting their theism to private\nlife and assuming for professional purposes a position that is\nindistinguishable from naturalism. (Johnson 1995, 211)\n\n\nHe adds:\n\nMakeshift compromises between supernaturalism in religion and\nnaturalism in science may satisfy individuals, but they have little\nstanding in the intellectual world because they are recognized as a\nforced accommodation of conflicting lines of thought (p. 212).\n\n\nAt this point, the evolutionist will probably throw up his or her\nhands in despair. Where did the idea of \u2018makeshift\ncompromise\u2019 come from except from Johnson\u2019s imagination? In\nactual fact, many significant theologians of our age think that, with\nrespect to miracles, science and religion have no conflict (Barth\n1949; Gilkey 1985). They would add that faith without difficulty and\nopposition is not true faith, either. \u201cAs the Danish philosopher\nS\u00f8ren Kierkegaard \u2026 taught us, too much objective\ncertainty deadens the very soul of faith. Genuine piety is possible\nonly in the face of radical uncertainty\u201d (Haught 1995, 59). Such\nthinkers, often conservative theologically, are inspired by Martin\nBuber to find God in the center of personal relationships, I-Thou,\nrather in science, I-It. For them there is something degrading in the\nthought of Jesus as a miracle man, a sort of fugitive from the Ed\nSullivan Show. What happened with the five thousand? Some hokey-pokey\nover a few loaves and fishes? Or did Jesus fill the multitude\u2019s heart\nwith love, so there was a spontaneous outpouring of generosity and\nsharing, as every one in the crowd was fed by the food brought by a\nfew? These theologians would agree fully with the first part of\nJohnson\u2019s characterization of \u201ctheism\u201d. Things were very\ndifferent thanks to Jesus\u2019 presence and actions. What they deny, here\nor elsewhere, is the need to search for exception to law.\n\nJohnson\u2019s Creationism and evolution/naturalism are indeed in conflict.\nBut Johnson\u2019s Creationism is not all that there is to religion, to\nChristianity in particular. There are those who call themselves\ntheists, who think that one can be a methodological naturalist, where\ntoday this would imply evolution (Ruse 2010). Johnson has not argued\nagainst them.\n",
