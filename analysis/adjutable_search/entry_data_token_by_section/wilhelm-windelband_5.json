    "main_text": "The History of Philosophical Problems\n6. The History of Philosophical Problems\n\nA large part of Windelband\u2019s oeuvre consists of\nwritings in the history of philosophy. Windelband primarily covers\nmodern philosophy from the Renaissance to his own time, but he also\npublished on ancient philosophy. As a historian, Windelband is heavily\nindebted to Fischer. And yet, he goes significantly beyond his\nteacher, developing a new method and mode of historical presentation.\nWindelband conceives of the history of philosophy as a \u201chistory\nof problems\u201d. Rather than presenting a chronological sequence of\ngreat minds, he organizes the presentation of philosophical ideas\naccording to the fundamental problems around which the philosophical\ndebates and arguments of an age were structured. Windelband also takes\na reflective attitude towards his own historiographical practice and\nseeks to clarify the goals and systematic relevance of the history of\nphilosophy.\n\nIn these reflections, Windelband seeks to integrate two main thoughts:\nFirst, the idea that philosophy is a reflection of its time and age\nand, second, the conviction that the history of philosophy has\nsystematic significance. Windelband finds both thoughts in\nHegel\u2019s approach to the history of philosophy. Mirroring\nHegel\u2019s famous dictum that \u201cphilosophy is its own time\napprehended in thought\u201d, he speaks of philosophy the\n\u201cself-consciousness of developing cultural life\u201d (1909:\n4). He also applauds Hegel\u2019s \u201cdeep insight\u201d that the\nhistory of philosophy realizes reason and thus has intrinsic relevance\nfor systematic philosophy (1883: 133). Windelband thinks of history as\nthe \u201corganon of philosophy\u201d (1905: 184), as a guide to the\nabsolute values that the critical method seeks to reveal.\n\nBut despite the Hegelian gloss of these two claims, Windelband is\ncritical of Hegelianism. This is primarily because he has a different\nunderstanding of the idea that philosophy is \u201cits own time\napprehended in thought\u201d. For Windelband, this means that\nphilosophical thinking is shaped by historically contingent\nfactors.\n\nAccordingly, Windelband formulates two criticisms of the Hegelian\nconception of the history of philosophy. First, he finds fault with\nthe idea that the order in which successive philosophical ideas emerge\nis necessary and that\u2014in virtue of being necessary\u2014it has\nsystematic significance: \n\n\n[I]n its essentially empirical determination which is accidental with\nrespect to the \u201cidea\u201d the historical process of\ndevelopment cannot have this systematic significance. (1883: 133, see\nalso 1905: 176\u2013177) \n\n\nThe history of philosophy is not only shaped by the necessary\nself-expression of reason, but also by the causal necessity of\ncultural history. The cultural determinants of philosophical thinking\nlead to \u201cproblem-convolutions\u201d (1891: 11), in which\nvarious, conceptually unrelated philosophical questions merge with one\nanother. Windelband also emphasizes that the \u201cindividual\nfactor\u201d of the philosopher\u2019s character and personality is\nrelevant for how philosophical problems and concepts are articulated\nin a given historical moment (1891: 12)\n\nSecond, although Windelband agrees that the historical development of\nphilosophical ideas is partly driven by critique and self-improvement,\nhe does not think of this process in terms of progress. Windelband\nprobes the often unacknowledged presuppositions of our talk about\nprogress. In \u201cPessimismus und Wissenschaft\u201d (1876)\nWindelband argues that science cannot decide between historical\noptimism and historical pessimism (1876: 243). In \u201cKritische und\ngenetische Methode\u201d (1883) he gives a more detailed analysis of\nwhy this is the case. Historical change itself is not progress, he\nobserves. In order to determine whether a given historical development\nis progressive, we need to be in possession of \u201ca standard, the\nidea of a purpose, which determines the value of the change\u201d\n(1883: 119). Windelband is wary of triumphalist narratives that\nidentify the historical development of present-day values with\nprogress. History is determined by contingent cultural factors and\ncould have produced \u201cdelusions and follies \u2026 which we\nonly take to be truths now because we are inescapably trapped in\nthem\u201d (1883: 121). Of progress we can only speak legitimately,\nif we are in possession of an absolute value that allows us to assess\nthe historical development. At minimum, this means that the appeal to\na progressive history of philosophy is of no help when it comes to the\nsystematic task of uncovering the system of absolute values: progress\ncannot aid in revealing absolute values as it presupposes them.\n\nBut while the fact that philosophy is at least partly determined by\ncontingent cultural factors undercuts necessity and progress, it also\nopens the door for a reconceptualization of the \u201cessence\u201d\nof philosophy. In his Einleitung in die Philosophie\n[Introduction to philosophy] (1914) Windelband reflects on\nthe fact that everyday life, culture, and science do already contain\ngeneral concepts of the world. These concepts form the initial content\nof philosophical reflection (1914: 6). But the business of philosophy\nonly takes off when these initial concepts, and the assumptions that\nare baked into them, become unstable and collapse. An experience of\nshock and unsettling prompts philosophy to question, rethink, and\ncritically assess the concepts and ideas of everyday life and science.\nIn this process of critical assessment, philosophy strives to purify\nthese concepts and ideas, and to connect them into a coherent, unified\nsystem. According to Windelband, in this process of conceptual\nreorganization, a rational necessity exerts itself. The\n\u201cvigorous and uncompromising rethinking of the preconditions of\nour spiritual life\u201d creates certain philosophical problems\n\u201cwith objective necessity\u201d (1914: 8).\n\nWindelband provides neither a very detailed account of what\n\u201cphilosophical problems\u201d exactly are, nor of how precisely\nthey spring from the unsettling of everyday concepts. But he makes\nthree claims that, taken together, establish that philosophy, even\nwhen reflecting its particular age, is not solely determined by\ncontingent cultural factors. First, philosophical puzzles stem from\nthe \u201cinadequacy and contradictory imbalance\u201d of the\ncontents that philosophy receives from life and science (1891: 10).\nThat is, true philosophical problems emerge whenever the systematizing\ndrive of philosophy is confronted with the deep incoherence of life.\nSecond, philosophical problems are necessary because the conceptual\n\u201cmaterial\u201d found in life already contains \u201cthe\nobjective presuppositions and logical coercions for all rational\ndeliberation about it\u201d (1891: 10). The necessity of\nphilosophical problems is logical necessity. Third, despite historical\nchange \n\n\n[c]ertain differences of world- and life-attitudes reoccur over and\nover again, combat each other and destroy each other in mutual\ndialectics. (1914: 10) \n\n\nBecause philosophical problems emerge \u201cnecessarily\u201d and\n\u201cobjectively\u201d, they also reoccur throughout history.\nPhilosophical problems are thus timeless and eternal (1891:\n9\u201310; 1914: 11)).\n\nWindelband also believes that the history of philosophy, pursued\nempirically and scientifically, can disentangle from one another the\n\u201ctemporal causes and timeless reasons\u201d (1905: 189) that\ntogether give rise to the emergence of philosophical problems. \n\n\nOnly through knowledge of the empirical trajectory that is free of\nconstructions can come to light \u2026. what is the share of\n\u2026 the needs of the age on the one hand\u2026but on the other\nhand that of the objective necessities of conceptual progress. (1905:\n189) \n\n\nAt this point, Windelband reaches a clear verdict on the goal and\nsystematic significance of the history of philosophy: it lies in\ndisentangling that which is contingently actually accepted from that\nwhich is \u201cvalid in itself\u201d (1905: 199). History is the\n\u201corganon of critical philosophy\u201d precisely to the extent\nthat it allows us to distinguish the actually accepted norms of\ncultural life from that which is absolutely valid (1883: 132).\n",
