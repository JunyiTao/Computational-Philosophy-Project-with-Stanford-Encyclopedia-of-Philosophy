    "main_text": "Formal, Procedural and Substantive Requirements || Formal Aspects\n5.1 Formal Aspects\n\nThe best known are the eight formal principles of Lon Fuller\u2019s\n\u201cinner morality of law\u201d: (1964; see also the lists in\nFinnis 1980: 270\u20131; Rawls 1999: 208\u201310; and Raz 1979 [1977]:\n214\u201318) generality; publicity; prospectivity; intelligibility;\nconsistency; practicability; stability; and congruence. These\nprinciples are formal, because they concern the form of the norms that\nare applied to our conduct. \n\nSo for example, the requirement that laws be general in character,\nrather than aimed at particular individuals, is purely a matter of\nform. It is compatible with invidious discrimination so far as its\nsubstance is concerned, since even a norm like \u201cA person who is\nof African descent must sit in the back of any public bus that they\nride on\u201d applies, universalizably, to everyone. A formal\nrequirement of generality does not guarantee justice; but that partly\nreflects the fact that justice and the Rule of Law work as separate\ncriteria for evaluating a political system.\n\nGenerality is an important feature of legality, reflected in the\nlongstanding constitutional antipathy to Bills of Attainder. Of course\nlaw cannot work without particular orders, but as Raz points out (1979\n[1977]: 213) the generality requirement is usually taken to mean that\n\u201cthe making of particular laws should be guided by open and\nrelatively stable general rules\u201d. These rules themselves should\noperate impersonally and impartially.\n\nBesides the form of the rules themselves there is also the nature of\ntheir presence in society. The Rule of Law envisages law operating as\na relatively stable set of norms available as public knowledge. It\nrequires that laws be public and that they be promulgated well in\nadvance of individuals\u2019 being held responsible for complying\nwith them. These are features that flow partly from the fact that laws\nare supposed to guide conduct, which they cannot do if they are secret\nor retroactive. But it is not just a matter of the pragmatics of\ngovernance. Laws face in two directions: (i) they impose requirements\nfor ordinary citizens to comply with; and (ii) they issue instructions\nto officials about what to do in the event of non-compliance by the\ncitizens. Laws that are secret and retroactive so far as (i) is\nconcerned may still operate effectively in respect of (ii). So the\nRule-of-Law requirements of publicity and prospectivity have an\nadditional significance: they require that citizens be put on notice\nof what is required of them and of any basis on which they are liable\nbe held to account.\n\nThe requirement of clarity is also important in this regard. Laws must\nbe public not only in the sense of actual promulgation but also in the\nsense of accessibility and intelligibly. True, much modern law is\nnecessarily technical (Weber 1968 [1922]: 882\u201395) and the\nlay-person will often require professional advice as to what the law\nrequires of him. It is also an important part of the Rule of Law that\nthere be a competent profession available to offer such advice and\nthat the law must be such as to make it possible for professionals at\nleast to get a reliable picture of what the law at any given time\nrequires. In the nineteenth century, Jeremy Bentham (1782: ch. 15 and\n1792) criticized customary law in general, and common law in\nparticular, for failing to satisfy this requirement: the sources of\nlaw were hidden in obscurity and though there were spurious appeals to\nprecedent, much of the law was just made up by the judges as they went\nalong.\n",
