    "main_text": "Human and Artificial Intelligence\n3. Human and Artificial Intelligence\n\nAlgorithms are enormously varied in their mathematical structures and\nunderpinning conceptual commitments, and more philosophical work needs\nto be carried out on the specifics of computational tools and software\nused in data science and related applications\u2014with emerging work\nin philosophy of computer science providing an excellent way forward\n(Turner & Angius 2019). Nevertheless, it is clear that whether or\nnot a given algorithm successfully applies to the data at hand depends\non factors that cannot be controlled through statistical or even\ncomputational methods: for instance, the size, structure and format of\nthe data, the nature of the classifiers used to partition the data,\nthe complexity of decision boundaries and the very goals of the\ninvestigation.\n\nIn a forceful critique informed by the philosophy of mathematics,\nChristian Calude and Giuseppe Longo argued that there is a fundamental\nproblem with the assumption that more data will necessarily yield more\ninformation: \n\n\nvery large databases have to contain arbitrary correlations. These\ncorrelations appear only due to the size, not the nature, of data.\n(Calude & Longo 2017: 595) \n\n\nThey conclude that big data analysis is by definition unable to\ndistinguish spurious from meaningful correlations and is therefore a\nthreat to scientific research. A related worry, sometimes dubbed\n\u201cthe curse of dimensionality\u201d by data scientists, concerns\nthe extent to which the analysis of a given dataset can be scaled up\nin complexity and in the number of variables being considered. It is\nwell known that the more dimensions one considers in classifying\nsamples, for example, the larger the dataset on which such dimensions\ncan be accurately generalised. This demonstrates the continuing, tight\ndependence between the volume and quality of data on the one hand, and\nthe type and breadth of research questions for which data need to\nserve as evidence on the other hand.\n\nDetermining the fit between inferential methods and data requires high\nlevels of expertise and contextual judgement (a situation known within\nmachine learning as the \u201cno free lunch theorem\u201d). Indeed,\noverreliance on software for inference and data modelling can yield\nhighly problematic results. Symons and Horner note that the use of\ncomplex software in big data analysis makes margins of error\nunknowable, because there is no clear way to test them statistically\n(Symons & Horner 2014: 473). The path complexity of programs with\nhigh conditionality imposes limits on standard error correction\ntechniques. As a consequence, there is no effective method for\ncharacterising the error distribution in the software except by\ntesting all paths in the code, which is unrealistic and intractable in\nthe vast majority of cases due to the complexity of the code.\n\nRather than acting as a substitute, the effective and responsible use\nof artificial intelligence tools in big data analysis requires the\nstrategic exercise of human intelligence\u2014but for this to happen,\nAI systems applied to big data need to be accessible to scrutiny and\nmodification. Whether or not this is the case, and who is best\nqualified to exercise such scrutiny, is under dispute. Thomas Nickles\nargued that the increasingly complex and distributed algorithms used\nfor data analysis follow in the footsteps of long-standing scientific\nattempts to transcend the limits of human cognition. The resulting\nepistemic systems may no longer be intelligible to humans: an\n\u201calien intelligence\u201d within which \u201chuman abilities\nare no longer the ultimate criteria of epistemic success\u201d\n(Nickles forthcoming). Such unbound cognition holds the promise of\nenabling powerful inferential reasoning from previously unimaginable\nvolumes of data. The difficulties in contextualising and scrutinising\nsuch reasoning, however, sheds doubt on the reliability of the\nresults. It is not only machine learning algorithms that are becoming\nincreasingly inaccessible to evaluation: beyond the complexities of\nprogramming code, computational data analysis requires a whole\necosystem of classifications, models, networks and inference tools\nwhich typically have different histories and purposes, and whose\nrelation to each other\u2014and effects when they are used\ntogether\u2014are far from understood and may well be\nuntraceable.\n\nThis raises the question of whether the knowledge produced by such\ndata analytic systems is at all intelligible to humans, and if so,\nwhat forms of intelligibility it yields. It is certainly the case that\nderiving knowledge from big data may not involve an increase in human\nunderstanding, especially if understanding is understood as an\nepistemic skill (de Regt 2017). This may not be a problem to those who\nawait the rise of a new species of intelligent machines, who may\nmaster new cognitive tools in a way that humans cannot. But as\nNickles, Nicholas Rescher (1984), Werner Callebaut (2012) and others\npointed out, even in that case \u201cwe would not have arrived at\nperspective-free science\u201d (Nickles forthcoming). While the human\nhistories and assumptions interwoven into these systems may be hard to\ndisentangle, they still affect their outcomes; and whether or not\nthese processes of inquiry are open to critical scrutiny, their telos,\nimplications and significance for life on the planet arguably should\nbe. As argued by Dan McQuillan (2018), the increasing automation of\nbig data analytics may foster acceptance of a Neoplatonist\nmachinic metaphysics, within which mathematical structures\n\u201cuncovered\u201d by AI would trump any appeal to human\nexperience. Luciano Floridi echoes this intuition in his analysis of\nwhat he calls the infosphere: \n\n\nThe great opportunities offered by Information and Communication\nTechnologies come with a huge intellectual responsibility to\nunderstand them and take advantage of them in the right way.\n(2014: vii)\n\n\nThese considerations parallel Paul Humphreys\u2019s long-standing\ncritique of computer simulations as epistemically opaque\n(Humphreys 2004, 2009)\u2014and particularly his definition of what\nhe calls essential epistemic opacity: \n\n\nA process is essentially epistemically opaque to X if and only\nif it is impossible, given the nature of X, for\nX to know all of the epistemically relevant elements of the\nprocess. (Humphreys 2009: 618) \n\n\nDifferent facets of the general problem of epistemic opacity are\nstressed within the vast philosophical scholarship on the role of\nmodelling, computing and simulations in the sciences: the implications\nof lacking experimental access to the concrete parts of the world\nbeing modelled, for instance (Morgan 2005; Parker 2009; Radder 2009);\nthe difficulties in testing the reliability of computational methods\nused within simulations (Winsberg 2010; Morrison 2015); the relation\nbetween opacity and justification (Dur\u00e1n & Formanek 2018);\nthe forms of black-boxing associated to mechanistic reasoning\nimplemented in computational analysis (Craver and Darden 2013; Bechtel\n2016); and the debate over the intrinsic limits of computational\napproaches and related expertise (Collins 1990; Dreyfus 1992). Roman\nFrigg and Julian Reiss argued that such issues do not constitute\nfundamental challenges to the nature of inquiry and modelling, and in\nfact exist in a continuum with traditional methodological issues\nwell-known within the sciences (Frigg & Reiss 2009). Whether or\nnot one agrees with this position (Humphreys 2009; Beisbart 2012), big\ndata analysis is clearly pushing computational and statistical methods\nto their limit, thus highlighting the boundaries to what even\ntechnologically augmented human beings are capable of knowing and\nunderstanding.\n",
