    "main_text": "Becoming Parents || Labor-based accounts\n4.2 Labor-based accounts\n\nAn alternative account views parents\u2019 work, rather than their\ngenetic relationships, as essential to the parental relation.\nAccording to these labor-based accounts, people who play or have\nplayed a parental role in a child\u2019s life have thereby become the\nparents. In this spirit, a number of authors have argued that the\nprimary ground of parenthood is the gestational relation (Rothman\n1989; Feldman 1992). In reproductive contexts in which a child\u2019s\ngestational mother differs from its genetic mother\u2014as in egg (or\nembryo) donation and gestational surrogacy\u2014it is therefore the\ngestational mother who has the primary claim to parental rights and\nresponsibilities. This line of argument can be expanded to include\npeople besides the gestational mother who have taken a parental role\nin rearing a child (Millum 2010; 2017).\n\nThree main considerations are presented in favor of labor-based\naccounts. One focuses on the interests of the child. Where a child has\nbeen looked after by a person or people for some time, it is thought\nto be very damaging for her to be taken away from them (Archard 2004).\nIn the case of gestation, since the gestational mother is guaranteed\nto be identifiable at birth, it may be thought in the best interests\nof the child that she be regarded as the mother (Annas 1984).\nMoreover, the child and gestator are already involved in an intimate\nrelationship at birth, which it is arguably prima facie wrong to sever\n(Gheaus 2018a). However, while recognizing the gestational mother or\ncaregivers as parents will sometimes serve the best interests of the\nchild, it is implausible that this will always be the case. This\nargument might, at best, ground laws presuming that the gestational\nmother and rearing parents have a claim to be the legal parents. Since\nthere will likely be cases in which being reared by someone else would\nbe better for the child, it will be difficult to justify the\nassignment of parenthood on the grounds of labor in every case.\n\nA second line of argument appeals to what parents deserve for the work\nthey do. Gestational mothers typically invest a substantial amount of\neffort into the child. In Narayan\u2019s words, a gestational mother\ntypically undergoes \u201cconsiderable discomfort, effort, and risk\nin the course of pregnancy and childbirth\u201d (Narayan 1999, 81;\nalso Gheaus 2012). While this account appears to give a special role\nto gestational mothers, it can include parenting partners who help\nbear the costs or contribute to establishing a relationship (for\nexample, by viewing an ultrasound image together). Similarly, the\npeople who care for a child invest a great deal of work. It might\ntherefore be thought that they deserve to be the parents (Millum 2010;\n2017).\n\nLabor-based accounts have the advantage over genetic accounts that\nthey can explain why the individuals they pick out as the parents\nought to have parental rights. They also incorporate adoptive and\nother non-biological parental relationships into a single account of\nparenthood, whereas genetic accounts seem forced to view\nnon-biological parenthood as a distinct type of normative\nrelationship. Objections to gestationalist accounts of parenthood may\nstart from the problem of paternity: if gestation is necessary for\nparenthood, how can men become fathers (Bayne & Kolers 2003)?\nBroader labor-based accounts that count the work of other caregivers\ncan explain fatherhood, but they still seem to give the gestational\nmother veto power over other potential parents. As Barbara Katz\nRothman puts it: \u201cif men want to have children, they will either\nhave to develop the technology that enables them to become pregnant\n\u2026 or have children through their relationships with\nwomen\u201d (Rothman 1989, 257). Some will find this implausible.\n",
