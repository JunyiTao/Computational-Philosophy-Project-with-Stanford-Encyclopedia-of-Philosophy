    "main_text": "Epistemological and Metaphysical Issues || The Epistemic Status of Intuitions and Perception of Mental States\n4.2 The Epistemic Status of Intuitions and Perception of Mental States\n For many people it seems obvious that familiar animals such as\ndogs and cats have conscious mental lives that include perceptual\nstates, motivational and hedonic states, basic emotions and social\nattachments.  David Hume, known for championing skepticism generally,\nwrote that \u201cno truth appears to me more evident, than that beasts are\nendow\u2019d with thought and reason as well as men\u201d (1888 p 176,\nreproduced in Jamieson 1998). Hume did not provide elaborate\nphilosophical or empirical arguments to this effect \u2014 he thought\nit was clear from observation.  As Searle (1998) puts it,\n\n I do not infer that my dog is conscious, any more than, when I came\ninto this room, I inferred that the people present are conscious. I\nsimply respond to them as is appropriate to conscious beings. I just\ntreat them as conscious beings and that is that.\n  \n\nWhat is the epistemic status of such pretheoretical intuitions (if\nthat is indeed a fair way of describing them)?\n\n Defenders of theories that deny consciousness to such animals must\ndeny that such intuitions have any epistemic weight. For example\nDennett (who argues that consciousness is unique to humans), claims\nthat intuitive attributions of mental states are \u201cuntrustworthy\u201d, and\npoints out that \u201cit is, in fact, ridiculously easy to induce powerful\nintuitions of not just sentience but full-blown consciousness (ripe\nwith malevolence or curiosity) by exposing people to quite simple\nrobots  made to move in familiar mammalian ways at mammalian speeds\n (1995).\u201d (Emphasis from the original.)\n Carruthers (1989) acknowledges that intuitive attributions of\nconsciousness to animals are widespread, and go hand in hand with\nsympathetic attitudes toward animals (e.g. wanting to prevent\nsuffering). However, he argues that these attitudes are incorrect, and\nwe have a moral imperative to purge or at least override them:\nIn the case of brutes: since their experiences, including\ntheir pains, are nonconscious ones, their pains are of no immediate\nmoral concern... Neither the pain of the broken leg, itself, nor its\nfurther effects upon the life of the dog, have any rational claim upon\nour sympathy... Are we really capable of suppressing our sympathy when\nwe see an animal (especially a cuddly one) in severe pain? Not only is\nit possible that this should occur \u2014 after all, the history of\nmankind is replete with examples of those who have eradicated all\nfeelings of sympathy even for members of other races, by telling\nthemselves that they are not \u2018really human\u2019 \u2014 but it\nis a moral imperative that it ought to. Much time and money is\npresently spent on alleviating the pains of brutes which ought\nproperly to be directed toward human beings, and many are now\ncampaigning to reduce the efficiency of modern farming methods because\nof the pain caused to the animals involved. If the arguments presented\nhere have been sound, such activities are not only morally\nunsupportable but morally objectionable (Carruthers 1989,\np. 268). \nIt should be noted that while Carruthers continues to argue that\nonly humans have consciousness, he has more recently amended his\nethical view, holding that animals may deserve some moral concern\ndespite lacking consciousness (1999).\n\nA crucial point here is how trustworthy these pretheoretic intuitions\nabout the minds of animals are.  Call Perceptualism the view\nthat there is direct perception of (at least some) mental states of\nothers. What this means is that, at least sometimes, when we observe\nanother in a mental state (e.g. in joy, or in pain) their mental state\nis part of the content of our perception \u2014 we perceive the\nmental states of others. In contrast, call inferentialism the\nview that we perceive \u2018mere behavior\u2019 and must infer or\nreason to conclusions about mental states. An alternative way of\nframing the issues is in terms of whether or not behavior as we\nperceive it is laden with mental properties. According to\nperceptualism, we (at least sometimes) perceive states of mind\nin behavior \u2014 an action (e.g. walking across a room) can\nbe perceivably angry or sad, purposeful or eager or hesitant,\netc. Goals, desires, motivations, emotions, pain or pleasure, and many\nother mental states are manifested in modes of action \u2014 though\nthey cannot be reduced to patterns of disposition to behave (this\nwould amount to behaviorism), they are tightly linked to behavior by\nconceptual, constitutive or causal connections that ground perceptual\naccess.\nJamieson (1998) argues for perceptualism, pointing out that our\neveryday practices of attributing mental states to nonhuman animals\nare deeply ingrained, automatic, conceptually unifying and empirically\npowerful. Strands of the same point of view can also be found in\nscientists writing about cognitive ethology and in\nWittgensteinian attitudes towards questions of animal mind (e.g.,\nGaita 2003). Perceptualism as a theory of social cognition\n(e.g. empathy) in philosophy of psychology has recently been defended\nby Zahavi (2011) and Gallagher (2008).\n The Perceptualism/Inferentialism question is critical for the\ndeciding the epistemic value of common sense attributions of mental\nstates to nonhuman animals. If inferentialism is true, then when I\nsee, e.g., a dog bounding around in front of me with a toy in its\nmouth, wagging its tail and looking at me, then I may consider the\npossibility that the dog wants my attention, that it is feeling\nhappy and playful \u2014 but this is only a hypothesis,\nfor which I must provide a solid argument from justified premises if I\nam to justifiably believe it. On a perceptualist account, by contrast,\nI literally see (or at least, seem to see) that the dog wants\nmy attention and feels happy and playful.\n Perception is usually understood to ground defeasible epistemic\nwarrant for belief \u2014 for example, if you look outside and it\nappears to be raining, you have some grounds to believe that it is\nraining. It is difficult to forgo this assumption without succumbing\nto radical global skepticism, since we base so many of our beliefs on\nperception.  If seeming to perceive something to be the case provides\ndefeasible epistemic warrant for believing it to be the case, than the\nfact the I seem to perceive a dog as being happy and playful warrants\nmy belief that the dog is happy and playful, i.e. warrants my\nascription of mental states to the dog. Given the prima facie\nepistemic support of seeming to perceive mental states in familiar\nanimals like dogs, perceptualists would argue that only overwhelming\nevidence should overturn the common-sense, intuitive attribution of\nmental states to those animals. Whereas, as discussed above,\nCarruthers (1989) argues that because his theory denies consciousness\nto animals, we should strive to eradicate our intuitive attributions\nof consciousness, a perceptualist would respond that the evidence\nderived from our perceptual encounters with dogs is more convincing\nthan his arguments (which hang on the plausibility of his higher order\nthought theory of consciousness; see section 6.1). \n Nevertheless, even if we have perceptual access to the mental\nstates of other humans and familiar animals like our pet dogs, there\nare sharp limitations to how far this will get us toward solving the\ngeneral problem of animal consciousness. First of all, our perceptual\naccess may be limited to animals that are familiar, comfortable\ninteracting with humans, and biologically very similar to humans\n(i.e. mammals). It may be much harder to \u2018see\u2019 what (if\nanything) a spider or a squid is thinking and feeling as she goes\nabout her business \u2014 both because these animals may express\ntheir mental states differently, and more radically because they may\nhave a very different repertoire of mental states.\n Second, as argued by Dennett, there are examples where our\nperceptions of mental states can be deceived \u2014 so Dennett seems\nto embrace perceptualism, but to hold that perceptions of mental\nstates are particularly unreliable. However, Dennett\u2019s favored example\nof the robot\n \u2018Cog\u2019,\n unlike nonhuman animals, was\nintentionally designed by human engineers to seem life-like, i.e., to\nmimic the dynamical properties of motion that trigger the perception\nof mindedness. Hence, there may be no more reason to fear that our\nseeming perceptions of mind in others are undermined by such examples\nthan to fear that our perception of objects in space is undermined by\nthe existence of photography \u2014 in both cases, human engineers\ncan be characterized as having figured out ways of creating perceptual\nillusions. There are deep questions about how perception of bodies in\nmotion might disclose the mental states of others \u2014 just as\nthere are deep questions about how visual perception of objects in\nspace is generally possible. But, pace Dennett, there is no\nclear reason why the existence of carefully crafted illusions\nundermines the general epistemic value of perception.\n\n Third, even among scientists who are sympathetic to the idea of\nthemselves as sensitive observers of animals with rich mental lives,\nthere is the recognition that the scientific context requires them to\nprovide a particular kind of empirical justification of mental state\nattributions. This demand requires those who would say that a tiger\npacing in the zoo is \u201cbored\u201d, or that the hooked fish is\nin pain to define their terms, state empirical criteria for their\napplication, and provide experimental or observational evidence for\ntheir claims. Even if perceptualism is a viable theory of folk\npractice with respect to attributing animal consciousness, it seems\nunlikely to make inroads against scientific epistemology. \n",
