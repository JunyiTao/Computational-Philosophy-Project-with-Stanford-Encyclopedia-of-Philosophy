It is of interest to\ncontemporary philosophers of science because of the way in which Kant\nattempts to articulate a philosophical framework that places\nsubstantive conditions on our scientific knowledge of the world while\nstill respecting the autonomy and diverse claims of particular\nsciences. Of enduring interest is also his doctrine of laws, including\nthose of scientific theories.\n\nKant\u2019s scientific writings are also of interest to historians of\nmodern philosophy, historians of science, and historians of philosophy\nof science. Historians of modern philosophy are especially interested\nin determining how Kant\u2019s views on science might complement or\nclarify his distinctive metaphysical and epistemological doctrines\n(e.g., as expressed in the Critique of Pure Reason).\nHistorians of science reflect on how Kant\u2019s position fits in\nwith the views of other natural philosophers of the period, such as\nNewton and Leibniz. Historians of philosophy of science investigate,\namong other things, Kant\u2019s work in the conceptual foundations of\nphysics \u2014 in particular, his matter theory, his theory of\nmotion, and his account of the basic laws of mechanics.\n\nBecause physics was Kant\u2019s primary (though not exclusive) focus\nover the course of his lengthy career, his views on physics during his\npre-Critical (1746\u201370), Critical (1781\u201390), and Post-Critical periods\n(after 1790) will be discussed in separate sections.

Physics: The Pre-Critical Period\n\nKant\u2019s early pre-Critical publications aim to solve a variety of\nbroadly cosmological problems, and to develop an increasingly\ncomprehensive metaphysics that would ground the matter theory required\nby the solutions to these problems. Kant\u2019s first publication,\nThoughts on the True Estimation of Living Forces (1746),\nexplicitly attempts to solve the vis viva controversy, which\nhad been hotly contested ever since Leibniz\u2019s 1686 attack on\nDescartes\u2019 laws of motion. While Kant attempts to occupy an\nintermediary position between the Cartesian and Leibnizian positions\nby maintaining that both mv and mv\u00b2 could be\nconserved in different contexts, what is of particular note is how his\nsolution in Parts II and III rests on the conception of force\ndeveloped in Part I. According to this conception, force is understood\nin terms of the activity of substances, an activity that Kant then\nuses to explain how the motions of bodies are generated, to solve the\nmind-body problem, and to account for both the possibility of other,\nactually existing worlds and the three-dimensionality of space.\n\nHis solution to the vis viva dispute is especially\ninteresting, because it presages his later approach to philosophical\ncontroversy. Rather than offering a conclusive argument in favor of\none position, Kant seeks to mediate between the two parties,\nLeibnizian and Cartesian. He argues that each measure of force is\ncorrect, but in different contexts. Kant distinguishes two ways of\nstudying bodies, \u201cmathematical\u201d and\n\u201cmetaphysical,\u201d and claims that they presuppose distinct\nconceptions of body. According to mathematical mechanics, a body\ncannot accelerate unless an external cause acts on it; for that\nreason, Kant declares, the Cartesians\u2019 quantity\nmv is the only one appropriate measure of\nforce in this context. \u201cNatural bodies,\u201d in contrast, have\nfeatures that mathematics brackets. One such feature is a capacity for\n\u201cvivification,\u201d whereby a body increases by itself the\nforce of motion that an external cause merely \u201cawakens.\u201d\nIn light of that, Kant concludes, the Leibnizian quantity\nmv2 is the correct measure of force in\nmetaphysical considerations of \u201cnatural bodies\u201d\n(1:140f).\n\nKant develops his account of the nature of substance in greater detail\nin A New Elucidation of the First Principles of\nMetaphysical Cognition (1755). While the first two sections of\nthis work undertake revisions of Wolff\u2019s principles of\nnon-contradiction and sufficient reason, the third section argues for\ntwo substantive principles that are alleged to follow from the\nprinciple of sufficient (or rather, following Crusius, determining)\nreason, namely the principles of succession and coexistence. The main\nthrust of the principle of succession is directed against Leibnizian\npre-established harmony, arguing that only causal connections\nbetween substances can bring about changes in their states.\nKant\u2019s position appears to be designed to account primarily for\nchanges of bodily states (with changes in mental states being\nparasitic upon them, as was explicitly asserted in the True\nEstimation). For he maintains that mutual changes of\nstate require mutual interaction, where it is clear that\nchanges in motion are precisely the kind of mutual change that he has\nin mind (since one body cannot move closer to another without the\nother body moving closer to it). The principle of coexistence then\nargues that harmonious causal interaction between otherwise isolated,\nindependently existing substances is possible only by means of\nGod\u2019s coordination (just as Leibniz thought was required for\nharmonious relations between the states of such\nsubstances).\n\nKant\u2019s Physical Monadology (1756) articulates a theory\nof matter that can reconcile the infinite divisibility of space, as\nmaintained in geometry, with the simplicity of substances, which Kant\nbelieves is required in metaphysics. As was the case with his earlier\nworks, the essential feature of his reconciliation lies in the way in\nwhich his matter theory is supported by his metaphysical views.\nSpecifically, Kant asserts that simple substances fill space not by\nmeans of their mere existence, but rather in virtue of their spheres\nof activity. As a result, any division of the relevant spheres of\nactivity does not compromise the simplicity of the substances\nthemselves, since the spatial properties of substances (including the\ninfinite divisibility of space) arise from the interaction between\ntheir activities rather than from their intrinsic features. In the\ncourse of the Physical Monadology, Kant also argues for the\nnecessity of attractive and repulsive forces and attributes a\nsignificant role to the force of inertia. Kant\u2019s acceptance of\nsuch Newtonian principles represents an important change of position\nover the True Estimation, where Kant rejects the principle of\ninertia and pursues a dynamical theory much more in line with\nLeibniz\u2019s views.\n\nLater in his pre-Critical period (1763\u201370), Kant attempts to build a\ncomprehensive metaphysical account on the basis of the framework that\nhe had established in his first works. Thus, in his The Only\nPossible Basis for a Demonstration of the Existence of God (1763)\nhe attempts to extend his reasoning to fundamental issues in both\nphilosophical theology and teleology, presenting, for the first time,\nhis now famous criticisms of the three traditional arguments for the\nexistence of God, while developing a new theistic proof, based on the\nidea that God is necessary as a real ground of the possibilities of\nthings. After reading Hume\u2019s Enquiry concerning Human\nUnderstanding in German translation sometime after 1755, Kant\ndistinguishes between real and logical grounds/opposition in his\nAttempt to Introduce the Concept of Negative Magnitudes into\nPhilosophy (1763) to avoid Hume\u2019s objection that there is\nno logical contradiction in the existence of one thing not following\nthe existence of another. But in this work he is also interested in\nexploring the notion of a real ground/opposition further by applying\nit more widely, e.g., to bodies, mental states, etc. Also relevant is\nKant\u2019s Concerning the Ultimate Foundation of the Distinction\nof the Directions in Space (1768) which modifies his earlier\naccount of space insofar as he seems to hold that certain spatial\nproperties \u2014 viz., chirality, or handedness \u2014 may not be\nable to be explained entirely in terms of direct relations between\nmaterial substances. In his so-called Inaugural Dissertation\n(1770), Kant continues to develop a more comprehensive philosophical\nsystem, which would encompass the principles of both the sensible and\nthe intelligible world, and in so doing modifies his account of space\nand time even further. Over the course of the next ten years, during\nwhich he published almost nothing, Kant would revise his views more\nsystematically, with the publication of the Critique of Pure\nReason in 1781 representing the first major step in his\n\u201ccritical turn.\u201d\n\nAdickes (1924), Harman (1982), Friedman (1992), Laywine (1993),\nSch\u00f6nfeld (2000), Kuehn (2001), Lefevre & Wunderlich (2000),\nand Watkins (1997, 2001, 2003, 2006, 2013) have emphasized the\nimportance of scientific issues in the development of Kant\u2019s\nthought during his pre-Critical period, as he reacted to Leibniz,\nNewton and other, more immediate predecessors (such as Christian\nWolff, Chr. A. Crusius, Leonhard Euler, Maupertuis, and Martin\nKnutzen). Smith (2013) reconstructs Kant\u2019s picture of matter in\nthe Physical Monadology.\n2. Physics: The Critical Period (Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science)\n\nThough Kant discusses issues relevant to physics in various works\nthroughout the Critical period (esp. the Critique of Pure\nReason), his views on this topic are developed most explicitly in\nthe Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science (1786), which\nconsists of a preface and four chapters.\n2.1 Preface\n\nIn the Preface to the Metaphysical Foundations Kant (i)\nanalyzes the concepts of nature and science so as to establish what\nconditions must be met for a body of knowledge to constitute natural\nscience in the proper sense, (ii) explains why science so understood\nrequires \u201ca pure part\u201d (4:469) and what criteria would\nhave to be satisfied for such a pure part to exist, (iii) argues that\nchemistry and psychology cannot at present meet these criteria, and\n(iv) describes what procedure should be followed to satisfy these\ncriteria and thus to provide the \u201cpure part\u201d that science\nproper requires.\n\nThe feature of Kant\u2019s conception of natural science proper that\nis most immediately striking is how restrictive it is. It requires\nthat cognition (i) be systematically ordered (ii) according to\nrational principles and (iii) be known a priori with apodictic\ncertainty, i.e., with \u201cconsciousness of their necessity\u201d\n(4:468). Because properly scientific cognition must satisfy these\nstrict conditions, it requires \u201ca pure part on which the\napodictic certainty that reason seeks can be based\u201d (4:469). But\nsince Kant identifies pure rational cognition that is generated from\nconcepts with metaphysics, it follows that science proper requires a\nmetaphysics of nature. He then specifies that such a metaphysics of\nnature could consist in either a \u201ctranscendental part,\u201d\nwhich discusses the laws that make possible the concept of a nature in\ngeneral \u2014 \u201ceven without relation to any determinate object\nof experience\u201d (4:469) \u2014 or a \u201cspecial\nmetaphysical\u201d part, which concerns a \u201cparticular nature of\nthis or that kind of things\u201d for which an empirical concept is\ngiven.\n\nKant\u2019s very conception of natural science proper thus\nimmediately gives rise to several systematically important questions.\nFirst, if the \u201ctranscendental part\u201d of the metaphysics of\nnature can be identified with the results of the Critique of Pure\nReason, then the Metaphysical Foundations is a work in\nspecial metaphysics. But what exactly is a special metaphysics? In\nparticular, what particular natures or kinds of things could be its\nobject? And how precisely can an empirical concept of such things be\ngiven without compromising the necessity required of the pure part of\nnatural science? Second, how is the special metaphysics provided by\nthe Metaphysical Foundations supposed to be related to the\ntranscendental part of the metaphysics of nature that was established\nin the Critique of Pure Reason? Does the former presuppose\nthe principles of the latter or are they logically independent, but\nstill related to each other in some other way? Another question\nconcerns the method of special metaphysics. Is that method the\nconceptual analysis (of the notion of matter), the transcendental\ninvestigation of the presuppositions of the mathematical science of\nnature, or something else entirely?\n\nFirst, Kant suggests that in special metaphysics the principles of the\ntranscendental part \u201care applied to the two species of objects\nof our senses\u201d (4:470). Thus, the particular kinds of things\nthat could be investigated in a special metaphysics are (i) the\nobjects of outer sense, i.e., matter, and (ii) the objects of inner\nsense, i.e., thinking beings, which would thus result in a doctrine of\nbody and a doctrine of soul. Kant then argues that because \u201cthe\npossibility of determinate natural things cannot be cognized from\ntheir mere concepts \u2026 it is still required that the\nintuition corresponding to the concept be given a\npriori, that is, that the concept be constructed\u201d (4:470),\nwhich is a task that requires mathematics. This is Kant\u2019s\njustification for his famous claim that \u201cin any special doctrine\nof nature there can be only as much proper science as there\nis mathematics therein\u201d (4:470). This argument suggests\nthat the necessity required of the pure part of natural science\nderives from the necessity of the rules by which the mathematical\nconstruction of determinate things must proceed.\n\nKant then uses the claim that science proper requires the construction\nof the concept of the object in a priori intuition to exclude the\npossibility that chemistry and psychology, at least as they were\npracticed at that time, could count as science proper. In the case of\nchemistry, the problem is that \u201cno law of the approach or\nwithdrawal of the parts of matter can be specified according to which\n\u2026 their motions and all the consequences thereof can be made\nintuitive and presented a priori in space (a demand that will\nonly with great difficulty ever be fulfilled)\u201d (4:471). Since\nits principles are \u201cmerely empirical,\u201d it can, at best, be\na \u201csystematic art\u201d (ibid.). The case of psychology is more\ncomplex, since Kant provides (at least) two separate reasons in the\nPreface for denying it the status of natural science proper. First,\nKant claims that mathematics is inapplicable to the phenomena of inner\nsense and their laws, though he grants that the law of continuity\n(discussed, e.g., at A207\u2013209/B253\u2013255 and\nA228\u2013229/B281 in the Critique of Pure Reason) ought to\napply to changes in our representations as well. He downplays the\nsignificance of this application of the law of continuity, however, by\nnoting that time has only one dimension, which does not provide enough\nmaterial to extend our cognition significantly. Second, Kant also\ncomplains that empirical psychology cannot separate and recombine the\nphenomena of inner sense at will; rather, our inner observations can\nbe separated \u201conly by mere division in thought\u201d (4:471).\nKant\u2019s fuller views on chemistry and psychology will be\ndiscussed further below.\n\nSecond, in explaining how mathematics can be applied to bodies Kant\nasserts that \u201cprinciples for the construction of the\nconcepts that belong to the possibility of matter in general must\nfirst be introduced. Therefore a complete analysis of the concept of a\nmatter in general [must be provided in which it] makes use of no\nparticular experiences, but only that which it finds in the isolated\n(although intrinsically empirical) concept itself, in relation to the\npure intuitions in space and time, and in accordance with laws that\nalready essentially attach to the concept of nature in general\u201d\n(4:472). Kant then explains that this means that the concept of matter\nmust be determined according to the Critique of Pure\nReason\u2019s categories of quantity, quality, relation, and\nmodality (4:474\u2013476). Further, Kant holds that \u201ca new\ndetermination\u201d (4:476) must be added to the concept of matter in\neach chapter of the Metaphysical Foundations. This suggests\nnot only that the principles argued for in the Metaphysical\nFoundations are to be developed \u201cin accordance with\u201d\nthe principles defended in the Critique of Pure Reason, but\nalso that both the concept of matter and the Metaphysical\nFoundations itself is structured according to the Critique of\nPure Reason\u2019s table of categories.\n\nUnfortunately, these points of clarification do not resolve all of the\nissues that are immediately raised by Kant\u2019s pronouncements\nabout what is required for natural science proper. One further issue\nthat is relevant here concerns the concept of matter that is at the\nheart of the Metaphysical Foundations. Kant introduces it in\nthe Critique of Pure Reason (A847\u2013848/B875\u2013876)\nas the concept of something that is impenetrable, extended, and inert.\nYet, in the beginning of the Preface of the Metaphysical\nFoundations, he describes it as whatever is an object of outer\nsense, and later he argues that the \u201cbasic determination of\nsomething that is to be an object of the outer senses had to be\nmotion, because only thereby can these senses be affected\u201d\n(4:476). Whatever weight one accords Kant\u2019s justification of the\nconnection between matter, outer sense, and motion, one faces a\ndilemma. If the concept of matter, most fundamentally, is simply the\nconcept of any object of outer sense, then how is it still empirical\nin any genuine sense (and what has become of the structural difference\nKant draws between the Critique of Pure Reason and the\nMetaphysical Foundations)? If, by contrast, impenetrability,\nextension, and movability are deemed the basic traits of the concept\nof matter, then how can one know a priori that any object we might\nencounter in outer sense must behave in accordance with the laws that\nwould govern matter so defined?\n\nMoreover, even if one can find an appropriately nuanced sense in which\nthe concept of matter is empirical while still allowing for an\nappropriate kind of necessity, questions can still be posed about the\n\u201cnew determinations\u201d that are to be added to that concept\nin each chapter of the Metaphysical Foundations. For example,\nwhat is the justification for each specific determination that is\nadded when one thinks of matter as having a quantity, a quality, etc.?\nAlso, what is the relationship between each new determination of\nmatter and the various claims that Kant makes in each chapter of the\nMetaphysical Foundations? In particular, when Kant explicitly\ninvokes principles for constructing concepts belonging to the\npossibility of matter, is his idea that these principles are required\ninsofar as they make experience of the relevant \u201cnew\ndetermination\u201d of matter possible (so that Kant would be\ndeveloping a transcendental argument in the Metaphysical\nFoundations similar in many respects to the Critique of Pure\nReason)? Answers to these questions depend on how one interprets\nthe arguments Kant develops throughout the Metaphysical\nFoundations.\n\nThe conception of science that Kant presents in the Preface has been\nthe focus of considerable attention over the past several decades. In\nthe German literature, the issues raised above have been discussed at\nlength by Plaass (1965), Cramer (1985), and others. Pollok (2001) has\nrecently produced a detailed and comprehensive textual commentary on\nthe Metaphysical Foundations. Important work has also been\ndone in the English literature by Walker (1974), Brittan (1978),\nBuchdahl (1968, 1969, and 1986), Parsons (1984), Butts (1986), and\nWatkins (1998a). Friedman (1992, 2001, 2002 and 2013) has been\nespecially influential on these issues as well. Several chapters (by\nSturm, Breitenbach, and Friedman, respectively) in McNulty 2022 add to\nour understanding of this aspect in Kant\u2019s thought.\n2.2 Phoronomy\n\nThe first chapter of the Metaphysical Foundations, the\nPhoronomy, considers the quantity of motion of matter and how it is to\nbe constructed in intuition a priori (so as to produce the kind of\nrules that are necessary for our experience of matter in motion).\nSince extension and impenetrability are not directly relevant to how\ndifferent magnitudes (or degrees) of motion can be represented, Kant\nrestricts his discussion in this chapter to matter considered as a\npoint. Since the motion of a point in space can be represented\nstraightforwardly, the main issue is how to represent the composition\nof two different motions. Kant\u2019s primary claim in this chapter\nis that due to the relativity of space (i.e., the fact that every\nmotion can be viewed arbitrarily as either the motion of a body in a\nspace at rest, or as a body in a state of rest in a space which is in\nmotion in the opposite direction with the same velocity) \u201cthe\ncomposition of two motions of one and the same point can only be\nthought in such a way that one of them is represented in absolute\nspace, and, instead of the other, a motion of the relative space with\nthe same speed occurring in the opposite direction is represented as\nthe same as the latter\u201d (4:490). The proof of this Theorem\nconsiders the three possible cases for the composition of two motions:\n(i) The two motions are in the same direction; (ii) the two motions\nare in opposite directions; (iii) the two motions enclose an angle.\nKant then shows how one can construct a priori in intuition a single\nmotion out of the two motions described in cases (i)-(iii). The\nsynthetic a priori outcome of this constructive procedure is a\ncomposition theorem that covers two fundamental results of classical\nphysics: the parallelogram rule for velocity addition, and the\nGalilean kinematic transformations. The theorem is needed for\narchitectonic reasons too, not just as a foundation for science. Kant\nuses the composition theorem as a premise in his Dynamics, so as to\ninfer a priori to forces from the composite motions they cause (e.g.,\n4:497). And, he invokes the theorem explicitly in his Mechanics, in\nthe course of \u201cconstructing the communication of motion,\u201d\ni.e. deriving the laws of impact (4:546).\n\nUntil recently, very little has been written directly on Kant\u2019s\nPhoronomy. Pollok (2001) is a historically rich commentary. Friedman\n(2013) untangles the complex strands of thought in Kant\u2019s\nchapter. His leading idea is that Kant\u2019s categories of quantity\n(of the First Critique) guarantee that motion is a magnitude, hence\nmathematics is applicable to the motions of bodies\u2014as\nkinematics. Two chapters (by Dunlop and Stan, respectively) in McNulty\n2022 add to our understanding of this aspect in Kant\u2019s\nthought.\n2.3 Dynamics\n\nThe second chapter of the Metaphysical Foundations, the\nDynamics, considers how it is possible to experience matter as filling\na determinate region in space. Propositions 1\u20134 are devoted to\nexhibiting the nature and necessity of repulsive forces. In\nProposition 1 Kant argues that repulsive force is required for matter\nto fill space, since solidity, understood by \u201cLambert and\nothers\u201d as the property matter would have by means of \u201cits\nmere existence\u201d (4:497), cannot truly explain how one\nmatter resists another matter\u2019s attempt to penetrate it. Kant\nthen specifies several central features of repulsive forces in\nPropositions 2 and 3. Repulsive forces admit of degrees to infinity,\nsince one must always be able to think of a slightly greater or lesser\nforce, and although matter can be compressed to infinity, it can never\nbe penetrated, since that would require an infinite compressing force,\nwhich is impossible.\n\nIn Proposition 4 Kant draws an important consequence from his\ncharacterization of repulsive forces, namely that matter is infinitely\ndivisible (4:503). What is especially striking about this point is\nthat it represents a significant departure from his own earlier\nPhysical Monadology, where he had accepted attractive and\nrepulsive forces, but denied the infinite divisibility of what\nultimately constitutes matter, namely physical points or monads. It is\ntrue that part of Kant\u2019s rationale for his change of position on\nthis point stems from the \u201ccritical turn\u201d undertaken in\nthe Critique of Pure Reason (and in its Second Antinomy in\nparticular). For once one recognizes that both space and spatial\nproperties such as divisibility are not properties of things in\nthemselves but rather only appearances, one can reject the proposition\nthat seems to necessitate the acceptance of simple substances, namely\nthe idea that simple substances must precede the wholes they compose\n(4:506). However, Kant\u2019s proof also seems to depend, in its\ndetails, not merely on the idea that every space is filled by means of\nsome repulsive force or other, but on the stronger claim that\nevery space is divisible into smaller spaces that are filled by\ndifferent repulsive forces.\n\nPropositions 5\u20138 are all devoted to attractive force. In\nProposition 5 Kant argues that matter must have an attractive force in\norder to fill space. Kant\u2019s argument is that if there were only\nrepulsive forces, then matter \u201cwould disperse itself to\ninfinity\u201d (4:508) since neither space nor other matter could\nlimit it. Proposition 6 argues that both attractive and repulsive\nforces must be considered essential to matter. That is, attractive\nforces alone are not sufficient to account for matter filling a space,\nsince if matter consisted solely of attractive forces, there would be\nno force to counteract the attractive force being exercised and the\nuniverse would collapse into a single point. Together, Propositions 5\nand 6 make up a \u2018balancing argument\u2019, which Kant had\nalready used in the earlier Physical Monadology. (A balancing\nargument is an existence proof for a type of force. Its premises are\n(1) an accepted universal fact, viz. that a certain stable\nconfiguration obtains; and (2) a type of force independently known to\nexist. The argument seeks to prove that the stability in question is\nimpossible unless a second kind of force exists to balance the first\nkind. In Kant\u2019s particular version of the balancing argument,\nthe universal fact is the constancy of mass density in a control\nvolume; and the given force is \u201coriginal repulsion,\u201d whose\nexistence he proves in Proposition 4.) Proposition 7 then specifies\nhow attractive forces are to be understood, namely as the immediate\naction of matter on other matter through empty space (and therefore at\na distance). Kant thus directly confronts the metaphysical question of\nhow to understand attraction that Newton attempted to avoid by\npositing it merely mathematically. As Kant interprets the situation,\nNewton \u201cabstracts from all hypotheses purporting to answer the\nquestion as to the cause of the universal attraction of matter\n\u2026 [since] this question is physical or metaphysical, but not\nmathematical\u201d (4:515). In response to the \u201cmost common\nobjection to immediate action at a distance,\u201d namely \u201cthat\na matter cannot act immediately where it is not\u201d\n(4:513), Kant argues that action at a distance is no more problematic\nthan action by contact (whether it be by collision or pressure), since\nin both cases a body is simply acting outside itself. Proposition 8\nconcludes by arguing that attractive forces act immediately to\ninfinity and by adding a \u201cpreliminary suggestion\u201d (4:518)\nas to how one might be able to construct the concept of cohesion\n(which Kant understands as attraction that is restricted to\ncontact).\n\nIn the General Remark to Dynamics Kant addresses two main issues.\nFirst, Kant considers how it is that the specific varieties of matter\n(e.g., water as different from mercury) might be reduced, at least in\nprinciple, to the fundamental forces of attraction and repulsion. The\nsecond issue concerns the fundamental distinction between the\n\u201cmathematical-mechanical\u201d and the\n\u201cmetaphysical-dynamical mode of explanation\u201d. The former\nmode of explanation, which is associated with the postulation of atoms\nand the void, employs nothing more than the shapes and motions of\nfundamental particles and empty interstices interspersed among them.\nIt contrasts with the metaphysical-dynamical mode, which employs\nfundamental moving forces (e.g., attraction and repulsion) in its\nexplanations. Kant grants that the mathematical-mechanical mode has an\nadvantage over the metaphysical-dynamical mode, since its fundamental\nposits can be represented (indeed, \u201cverified\u201d (4:525))\nmathematically, whereas he repeatedly admits that the possibility of\nfundamental forces can never be comprehended, i.e., their possibility\ncan never be rendered certain. However, Kant thinks that this\nadvantage is outweighed by two disadvantages. First, by presupposing\nabsolute impenetrability, the mathematical-mechanical mode of\nexplanation accepts an \u201cempty concept\u201d at its foundation.\nSecond, by giving up all forces that would be inherent in matter, such\na mode of explanation provides the imagination with more freedom\n\u201cthan is truly consistent with the caution of philosophy\u201d\n(4:525).\n\nGiven that the bulk of Kant\u2019s matter theory is presented in the\nDynamics, it is unsurprising that it has received the greatest amount\nof attention in the literature. Of particular note are discussions by\nBuchdahl (1968, 1969), Brittan (1978), Kitcher (1983), Butts (1986),\nCarrier (1990), Friedman (1990), Malzkorn (1998), Warren (2001, 2010),\nPollok (2002), Holden (2004), and Engelhard (2005). Friedman (2013) is\nan extensive commentary, under the overarching theme that Kant in the\nDynamics aims to explain how certain features of body \u2013 density,\nvolume, static weight \u2013 become mathematizable, as Newton\u2019s\ndynamics illustrates paradigmatically. Two chapters (by McNulty and\nWarren, respectively) in McNulty 2022 add to our understanding of this\naspect in Kant\u2019s thought.\n2.4 Mechanics\n\nThe third chapter of Kant\u2019s Metaphysical Foundations,\nthe Mechanics, concerns how it is possible to experience matter as\nhaving a moving force, that is, how one matter communicates its motion\nto another by means of its moving force. Kant begins, in Proposition\n1, by clarifying how the quantity of matter is to be estimated before\nstating, in Propositions 2\u20134, three Laws of Mechanics.\n\nAfter first defining the quantity of matter and the quantity of motion\n(or, in contemporary terms, impulse, i=mv), Kant\nasserts that the quantity of matter, in comparison with every\nother matter, can be estimated only by the quantity of motion at a\ngiven speed (4:537). Kant\u2019s proof proceeds by way of\nelimination. The quantity of matter, which is the aggregate of the\nmovable in a determinate space, cannot be estimated by counting the\nnumber of parts it has, since, as was established in the Dynamics,\nevery matter is infinitely divisible. Nor can one estimate the\nquantity of matter merely by considering its volume, since different\nmatters can have different specific densities. As a result, the only\nuniversally applicable way of estimating the quantity of matter is to\nhold the velocity of matter constant.\n\nIn Proposition 2, Kant states his First Law of Mechanics: the total\nquantity of matter remains the same throughout all changes in matter\n(4:541). His proof seems to rely (i) on the principle of the First\nAnalogy of Experience that no substance arises or perishes throughout\nany change in nature and (ii) on the identification of what in matter\nmust be substantial. On this latter point, Kant quickly assumes that\nthe ultimate subject of all accidents inhering in matter must be the\nmovable in space, and that its quantity is the aggregate of the\nmovable in space. In his remark to this proposition, Kant explicitly\nnotes that there is a crucial difference between spatial and\nnon-spatial substances, since the latter, unlike the former, could\ngradually fade away by degrees. (Kant cites the possibility of\nconsciousness as a concrete example.) Kant uses this difference to\nargue that since the quantity of matter consists in a plurality of\nreal things external to each other that cannot fade away (as\nconsciousness might), the only way to decrease its quantity is by\ndivision.\n\nKant\u2019s Second Law of Mechanics, stated in Proposition 3, is that\nevery change in matter has an external cause. (Immediately after this\nprinciple, Kant adds in parentheses a version of the law of inertia\nthat is much closer to Newton\u2019s: \u201cevery body persists in\nits state of rest or motion, in the same direction, and with the same\nspeed, if it is not compelled by an external cause to leave this\nstate\u201d (4:543). Since Kant\u2019s Second Law of Mechanics is\nnot identical to Newton\u2019s law of inertia, it would require\nargument to show that, and by means of what additional assumptions,\nthe former entails the latter.) The proof of the main principle\ndepends on the Second Analogy of Experience (which asserts that all\nchanges occur in accordance with the law of cause and effect and thus\nentails that every change in matter has a cause) as well as on the\nfurther assumption that matter has no internal grounds of\ndeterminations (such as thinking and desiring), but rather only\nexternal relations in space. In his remark to this proposition, which\nclarifies this \u201claw of inertia,\u201d Kant explains that\ninertia is to be contrasted with life or the ability of a substance to\ndetermine itself to act from an internal principle. Thus, a\nbody\u2019s inertia \u201cdoes not mean a positive striving\nto conserve its state\u201d (4:544), but rather what it does\nnot do, its lifelessness.\n\nKant also asserts that the very possibility of natural science proper\ndepends on the law of inertia, since the rejection of it would be\nhylozoism, \u201cthe death of all natural philosophy\u201d (4:544).\nIn a later remark in the Mechanics, Kant explicitly objects that\n\u201cthe terminology of inertial force (vis inertiae) must\nbe entirely banished from natural science, not only because it carries\nwith it a contradiction in terms, nor even because the law of inertia\n(lifelessness) might thereby be easily confused with the law of\nreaction in every communicated motion, but primarily because the\nmistaken idea of those who are not properly acquainted with the\nmechanical laws is thereby maintained and even strengthened\u201d\n(4:550). Kant goes on to point out that if inertia were to entail an\nactive force of resistance, then it would be possible that when one\nmoving body hits another, the moving body has to apply part of its\nmotion solely to overcome the inertia of the one at rest and might not\nhave any motion left over, as it were, to set the body at rest into\nmotion, which is contrary to experience (and Proposition 2).\n\nKant\u2019s Third Law of Mechanics, expressed in Proposition 4,\nasserts the equality of action and reaction in the communication of\nmotion. Kant formulates a version of the Third Analogy of Experience\n(according to which all external action in the world is interaction)\nand suggests that the main point at issue in mechanics is establishing\nthat mutual action is necessarily reaction. Kant\u2019s\nargument for this law is based on the following line of thought: (i)\nif all changes of matter are changes of motion; (ii) if all changes of\nmotion are reciprocal and equal (since one body cannot move closer\nto/farther away from another body without the second body moving\ncloser to/farther away from the first body and by exactly the same\namount); and (iii) if every change of matter has an external cause (a\nproposition that was established as the Second Law of Mechanics), then\nthe cause of the change of motion of the one body entails an equal and\nopposite cause of a change of motion of the other body or, in short,\naction must be equal to reaction.\n\nKant\u2019s Laws of Mechanics have been discussed widely in the\nsecondary literature. Especially helpful discussions are Friedman\n(1989, 1992), Brittan (1995), Westphal (1995), Carrier (2001), and\nWatkins (1997 and 1998b). The most sustained and through discussion of\nthem is in Watkins (2019). Much of the modern tradition of scholarship\nused to regard Kant\u2019s laws of mechanics as derived from, or even\nidentical with, Newton\u2019s three laws in the Principia.\nWatkins (2019) shows that Kant\u2019s formulation and justification\nof his laws was strongly influenced by a philosophy of nature stemming\nfrom Leibniz, not Newton. Stan (2013) further corroborates these\nfindings. As a result, it is safe to say that Kant\u2019s foundations\nof mechanics were significantly shaped by post-Leibnizian rationalism\ntoo, not just Newton\u2019s mechanics. This fact is now reflected in\nFriedman (2013), the most recent and detailed account of Kant\u2019s\ninterpretation of the conceptual foundations of mechanics. Stan (2014)\nexamines the conceptual link between Kant\u2019s theory of matter and\nhis laws of mechanics.\n2.5 Phenomenology\n\nThe final chapter of the Metaphysical Foundations, the\nPhenomenology, focuses on how the motion of matter can be experienced\nmodally. Specifically, Kant spells out conditions for us to judge\nlegitimately that a body possibly moves; is really in motion; or that\nits motion is necessary. Its three Propositions specify (in\naccordance, Kant suggests, with the results of the three previous\nchapters) that (i) rectilinear motion is a merely possible predicate\nof matter, (ii) circular motion is an actual predicate of matter, and\n(iii) the equal and opposite motion of one matter with respect to\nanother is a necessary motion of that matter. In the General Remark to\nthe Phenomenology, Kant discusses the status of absolute space, which\nhad been presupposed by the possible, actual, and necessary motions of\nmatter at issue in the three main propositions, and explains that\nsince it is not itself an object of experience, it must be represented\nby means of an idea of reason (in Kant\u2019s technical sense of\n\u201cidea,\u201d namely, as a concept for which a corresponding\nobject could never be given to us in intuition). Though we can never\nknow absolute space, it nonetheless functions as a regulative\nprinciple that guides us in our scientific practice by forcing us to\nlook for further conditions for the conditioned objects we meet with\nin experience. Kant\u2019s view that ideas of reason can function as\nregulative principles is developed in the Appendix to the\nTranscendental Dialectic in the Critique of Pure Reason.\n\nFriedman\u2019s interpretation of the Phenomenology deserves special\nmention. According to him, in light of Kant\u2019s rejection of\nNewton\u2019s absolute space and time, he must give an account of the\nconcept of true motion \u2013 as change of true place over time\n\u2013 presupposed by classical mechanics. To this end, Kant\n\u201cviews the laws of motion as definitive or constitutive of the\nspatio-temporal framework of Newtonian theory,\u201d hence these laws\n\u201ccount as a priori\u201d for him (1992, 143). The reason Kant\ntakes them as constitutive is the following. In Kant\u2019s\nPhenomenology, the three Newtonian laws define a concept of\ntrue motion: the true motions of bodies just are those that\nobey the dynamical laws. Moreover, the concept must be given\n\u201cobjective meaning in experience,\u201d viz. measured\nempirically. To do so, Kant views Newton\u2019s three laws as holding\nprimarily in a privileged system of reference, namely the\ncenter-of-mass (CM) frame of the system of the world, which the\nCM-frame of our Solar System approximates to a very good degree. Thus,\nby measuring the motions of bodies relative to this frame, we produce\nobjective experience of these motions. However, this frame must first\nbe located. To do so, Kant thinks, we must likewise count the\nlaw of universal gravitation as a priori, not empirical-inductive. If\nwe know a priori that all bodies in the Solar System necessarily\nattract each other, from their observable, mutually-induced\naccelerations we can infer their masses. In turn, knowing their masses\nwill enable us to locate the CM-frame of the system. (In a system of\nbodies, the center of mass is the point relative to which the\nbodies\u2019 distances are in inverse proportion to their masses.)\nWith respect to this distinguished frame, the motions of bodies count\nas their true motions, Friedman claims. However, the CM-frame of the\nSolar System is just approximately an inertial frame. Scientific\ninquiry must ultimately look beyond it, to better and better\napproximations of an inertial frame. And, Kant\u2019s absolute space\nis just the concept that directs our search for such approximations.\nMore recently, Friedman updated and expanded his interpretation in\n(2013). In view of recent scholarship, Friedman has now made a\nconvincing case that it is Kant\u2019s laws of mechanics\n\u2013 not Newton\u2019s three laws, as claimed in (1992) \u2013\nthat define the privileged frame (Kantian absolute space) relative to\nwhich bodies have true motions, in the Phenomenology.\n\nPrior to Friedman\u2019s interpretation, there is relatively little\nsecondary literature that discusses Kant\u2019s Phenomenology.\nCarrier (1992) gave an alternative to Friedman\u2019s account of Kant\non absolute space. Two chapters (by De Bianchi and Massimi,\nrespectively) in McNulty 2022 add to our understanding of this aspect\nin Kant\u2019s thought. Stan (forthcoming) assesses the Phenomenology\nin its early-modern context.\n3. Laws\n\nThe Scientific Revolution ushered in a new type of knowledge, based in\nlaws of nature. Kant\u2019s natural philosophy thus gave that notion\na central place. In particular, he analyzed it, he used it to single\nout certain laws as fundamental, and he weaved it into his picture of\nsystematic science. We go over these aspects in turn.\n\nNomic import. For the Critical Kant, a law is a\njudgment, or proposition, that is necessary and\nimposed by a faculty of the mind\u2014specifically, the\nunderstanding or reason. In the realm of theoretical knowledge, laws\ndetermine the object they govern. (In contrast, laws of practical\nreason bind their subjects, by mandating an action or a maxim for\nbehavior.) There are several classes of Kantian laws: transcendental\n(e.g., the pure principles of the understanding); metaphysical (such\nas his three laws of mechanics); and empirical (in particular, the\nlaws of chemistry).\n\nThe above picture, which Watkins 2019 articulates and defends in\ndetail, gives center stage to the thought that laws are partially\ngrounded in the natures of knowers like us\u2014specifically, in the\nfaculties (and their a priori structures) that Kant investigated in\nthe First Critique. Other construals leave this key element out,\nand rely on other resources from his theoretical philosophy. Some have\nproposed a \u2018necessitarian\u2019 account, in which Kantian laws\nare grounded in the natures of the things they are about, thus\nnatures\u2014the bodies\u2019 essential properties and\npowers\u2014are their necessity-makers (Messina 2017, Massimi 2017,\nEngelhard 2018). Others think that certain propositions, or judgments,\ncount as laws in virtue of their place in a best-system ordering of\nour knowledge as directed by Kant\u2019s ideas of reason (see, e.g.,\nKitcher 1986 or Breitenbach 2018). These two interpretive approaches\nturn Kant into a precursor of two major contemporary notions of law,\nby Fred Dretske and David Lewis, respectively. Watkins argues that, if\nread carefully, Kant in fact offers a view that combines the\nstrengths of the two pictures above: it retains the necessitarian\ndimension while emphasizing the role of our acts\u2014of us qua\nspontaneous epistemic subjects\u2014in regard to nature as the object\nof unified experience (Watkins 2019, esp. Chapter 2).\n\nIn philosophy of physics, Kant privileged three laws: Conservation of\nMass, the Law of Inertia, and the Equality of Action-Reaction. He\nregarded them as fundamental for mechanics as he understood it, viz.\nqua theory of momentum exchanges, or \u2018communication of\nmotion.\u2019 And, these laws lie closest\u2014explanatorily and\nevidentially\u2014to the Analogies of Experience, the most general\nprinciples of theoretical knowledge, in his system. Specifically, the\nSecond Analogy is a key premise in his derivation of his \u2018second\nmechanical law.\u2019\n\nThough somewhat intermittently, Kant reflected as well on empirical\nlaws, viz. nomic judgments that govern some restricted class of\nobjects or properties given a posteriori. He thought that, to count as\na rational science, a body of knowledge must include empirical laws\nsystematically connected. In the last decade, this long-neglected\naspect of his doctrine has began to receive the attention it deserves.\nScholarship has tended to concentrate on two main aspects. One is\nKant\u2019s basis for counting certain propositions as empirical\nlaws. Some see them as earning that status in virtue of their place in a\nbest-system organization of our knowledge; others think they become\nlaws at a certain stage in the process of inquiry (provided the\ninquiry is guided by specific normative Kantian principles, e.g. his\nPostulates of Empirical Thinking). The other aspect is whether\nempirical laws count as knowable by Kant\u2019s lights. Here too, the\nfield appears divided in two camps. Some think that, pace his positive\naccount of empirical laws, knowledge of them is beyond our reach (see,\nfor instance, Kreines 2017). Others have argued that, under the right\nconditions, research can lead to the discovery of empirical laws in\nthat particular domain, e.g. chemical phenomena (see, for instance,\nMcNulty 2015 and Cooper 2023).\n\nHypotheses. Natural science after 1650 often relied\non \u2018hypotheses,\u2019 or knowledge claims for which evidence\nwas less than conclusive. In optics, electricity, magnetism, heat\nscience, chemistry, and natural history hypotheses were rampant.\nAccordingly, some early-modern figures (e.g. Christian Wolff and\nEmilie du Ch\u00e2telet) developed doctrines to address this fact\nabout science then. Kant did too. In particular, he sought to identify\nnormative criteria for acceptable hypotheses, viz. thresholds that\ncandidate hypotheses must meet if theorizing from them is to count as\nlegitimate. He defended for three such criteria in his\n\u2018Discipline of Pure Reason in regard to Hypotheses,\u2019 a\npart of the First Critique. The first is that a candidate hypothesis\nhas to be about things that are \u2018really possible\u2019 in\nKant\u2019s sense; namely, spatio-temporal objects and\nproperties. (This rules out, for one, hypotheses about God being the\n\u2018cause of gravity,\u2019 which some Newtonians had peddled in\nthe early 1700s). The second is that a hypothesis must be about\nobjects and processes causally connected\u2014more broadly,\nconnected via the categories of relation\u2014to \u201cthat which is\nactually given, and so is certain\u201d (B798). Helpful studies of\nKant\u2019s account of hypotheses in their scientific and\nphilosophical context are Leduc 2013, Vanzo 2013, McNulty 2015, Cooper\n2023, and Demarest & van den Berg 2022.\n4. Physics: The Post-Critical Period (Opus postumum)\n\nKant\u2019s interest in physics continued after the publication of\nthe Metaphysical Foundations, in fact, until the very end of\nhis productive years. Though Kant never completed a manuscript that\ncould be put forward as a publication, the various notes, sketches,\nand drafts on topics in physics that he was working on intensively\nduring this time (especially after 1796) were gathered together over a\ncentury after his death and published as his so-called Opus\npostumum. It is a highly fragmentary work where Kant\u2019s\nthoughts remained in flux through the final parts, written ca. 1802.\nAccordingly, scholarship has sought to recover the evolution,\nbackground and import of his reflections, rather than some stable\ndoctrine, which it mostly lacks. Below we touch on his reason for\nwriting the Opus at all; two major themes relevant to\nphilosophy of science; and some implications for his natural\nphilosophy.\n\nWhy did Kant around 1796 begin to draft a new work? Most interpreters\nagree that he thought the Opus aimed to fill a\n\u2018gap\u2019 of sorts. In letters from 1798, he speaks\ncryptically about there being a \u2018gap\u2019 in his Critical\nphilosophy. Many have concluded the Opus aimed to fill\nthis gap, and so they turned their attention to identifying\nit. Some claimed it was a gap in Kant\u2019s theory of matter above\n(in particular, his accounts of mass and density); others saw it\nbetween his constitutive and regulative approaches to metaphysical\nfoundations for science; yet others have said it was a lacuna in his\nschematism of the categories. Lately, Howard (2023) has argued that it\nwas a missing part in the \u2018system of philosophy\u2019 as a\nwhole (hiatus in systemato, 21:476). He reads that as the\nneed to mediate\u2014by devising a bridge doctrine\u2014between\nKant\u2019s metaphysical foundations of natural science and\n\u2018physics as a system.\u2019\n\nThis reading elucidates two obscure parts in the Opus. One is\nKant\u2019s repeated attempts to articulate a\n\u2018transition.\u2019 In the picture that Howard sketches, the\ntransition would be the very mediating doctrine above: between a\ntheory in metaphysics and a body of empirical knowledge. The other is\nKant\u2019s repeated attempts there to define physics such\nthat he can defensibly say it counts as systematic science. For\ninstance: \u201cPhysics is systematic investigation of nature through\nempirically given forces of matter insofar as they are connected to\neach other in a system\u201d (22:298). Note just how broad his\ndefinition is\u2014it makes the various \u2018forces\u2019\ntheorized by early-modern chemistry, heat science, botany and animal\nphysiology count as part of physics qua organized doctrine.\n\nA central theme in the Opus is Kant\u2019s attempt to give\nan a priori proof that a certain entity must exist. He calls it the\n\u2018ether,\u2019 and also \u2018caloric.\u2019 He thought of it\nas a sort of universal substrate\u2014a fluid-like medium that fills\nall of physical space, supports \u2018moving forces,\u2019 and\ncarries their actions from one place to another (much like pressure\napplied at a point in an incompressible fluid travels across it to\nother locations). Kant saw it as his task to give a\n\u2018deduction\u2019 of this medium, viz. a species of\nnon-empirical evidence that it exists. Generally interpreters take his\n\u00c4therbeweis to be an actual deductive argument, which\nthey have tried to reconstruct (see, e.g., F\u00f6rster 2000 and Hall\n2006).\n\nAnother major theme there is Kant\u2019s quest for an\n\u2018elementary system of the moving forces\u2019 of nature. He\nmeans a methodic, or well-ordered, derivation of the\n\u2018specific\u2019 properties of matter. They are specific in that\nnone counts as general, or common to all matter; but none is too\nparticular or transient either. Rather, each is a feature of some\nbroad class of material behavior. Among the properties Kant ponders at\nthis juncture are \u2018heat,\u2019 \u2019weight,\u2019\n\u2019elasticity,\u2019 \u2019solidity,\u2019 and the like. He\ntakes these properties to be associated with \u2018moving\nforces\u2019: they result from some force being exerted (e.g.,\ngravity induces weight) or they cause some force of motion (e.g.\nelastic rebound pushes back the body that compressed an elastic\nmaterial). So, an elementary system of properties will be ipso facto a\nsystem of forces as well. In regard to it, Kant sought a rational\nheuristic: a recipe or criterion for a taxonomic account (of\nthese broadly-specific properties) that is a priori, viz. inferable\nbefore they are empirically discovered.\n\nLastly, what did Kant think his ether\u2014and, alternatively, his\n\u2018elementary\u2019 system\u2014would achieve? Here too,\nscholarship is somewhat divided. Older accounts thought the\n\u2018ether, or caloric\u2019 was Kant\u2019s basis for the bridge\ndoctrine, or transition, between metaphysics and empirical physics.\nMore recently, Howard (2023) has argued for a different line. Namely,\nthat Kant saw the ether deduction (and the taxonomy of\n\u2018elementary\u2019 forces) as the basis for an account of what\nmakes empirical physics a systematic body of knowledge\u2014or would\nmake it so in the long run, if properly pursued.\n\nThe Opus postumum has long been a topic of interest\nespecially insofar as it offers the hope of clarification and\ndevelopment of central issues in Kant\u2019s Critical philosophy.\nMuch scholarship on it was in German (Adickes 1920, Hoppe 1969,\nTuschling 1971, Blasche 1991, and Emundts 2004). Then it received\nincreased attention in English, with discussions by Friedman (1992,\nchapter 5), F\u00f6rster (2000), Edwards (2000), Guyer (2001), and\nHall (2006, 2009). Recent views on the Opus and its reception\nare presented in Basile (2013) and Basile & Lissy (2022). Howard\n(2023) is an overview of its key issues, and a novel reading of the\nnatural-philosophical issues Kant tackled there.\n5. Biology\n\nKant was interested not only in the inanimate bodies studied by\nphysics, but also in living organisms, which he viewed as deserving of\nadditional philosophical scrutiny due to their special status, for two\nreasons. First, the symmetries and regularities of their structure and\nworkings make them \u201cin the highest degree contingent\u201d (5:\n360) and \u201cmechanically inexplicable.\u201d Second, organisms\ncome from their own kind; grow their own functional parts, or organs,\nand repair them if they become damaged; and do in general exhibit\nhomeostasis. These facts about them prompt Kant to claim that an\norganism is \u201ccause and effect of itself\u201d (5: 370). In a\nsense, a living entity is self-caused, and indeed by a causality that\nwe can grasp solely \u201cunder the idea of purposes as a\nprinciple\u201d (5: 383). Organisms, in other words, are\n\u201cnatural purposes,\u201d or naturally occurring ensembles of\nparts purposefully fitted and working in unity.\n\nIt is just these peculiarities that create philosophical challenges\nnot met with in physics and chemistry. Kant tackles them in the latter\nhalf of his third magnum opus, the Critique of the Power of\nJudgment (1790). In particular, he claims that attempting to\nexplain organisms creates an inevitable conflict within reflective\njudgment, the faculty we employ in empirical concept formation,\ntaxonomic classification, and the explanatory unification of\nparticular laws. Kant describes that conflict in the Antinomy of\nTeleological Judgment (CJ \u00a7\u00a7 69\u201378; 5:\n385\u2013415). The Antinomy obtains between two regulative\nprinciples, herein prefixed by an \u2018R\u2019 to distinguish them\nfrom two similar constitutive principles that Kant briefly\ndiscusses in the same place:\n\n\nR-thesis:\n\nAll generation of material things and their forms must be judged as\npossible in accordance with merely mechanical laws.\n\nR-antithesis:\n\nSome products of material nature cannot be judged as possible\naccording to merely mechanical laws (judging them requires an entirely\ndifferent law of causality, namely that of final causality) (5:\n387).\n\n\nA great deal of scholarship has aimed to elucidate this antinomy, and\nin the last decade these interpretive efforts have gained new momentum\n(see also the entry \u201cKant\u2019s Aesthetics and\nTeleology\u201d in this encyclopedia). In particular, sustained\nattention has been given to three questions: In what sense are\norganisms inexplicable mechanically, for Kant? What exactly is the\ncontradiction that generates the Antinomy? And precisely how does Kant\nsolve it?\n\nFirst, clarification is needed about Kant\u2019s claim that organisms\ncannot be explained \u2018mechanically.\u2019 In the Enlightenment,\n\u2018mechanical\u2019 was used in at least two senses: broadly, to\ndenote explanation by physico-chemical laws of efficient\ncausation; and narrowly, restricted to the theory of \u2018compound\nmachines,\u2019 or assemblies of movable parts used to displace loads\nor transfer momentum, e.g. engines and watches. McLaughlin (1990)\ntakes Kant to mean \u2018mechanical\u2019 in this latter sense. In\nartificial machines, parts precede the whole temporally, and\ndetermine it: the machine\u2019s configuration results from\nsummation over the parts; and its laws of operation are the same as\nthose governing the parts. But organisms are different: the whole\nprecedes its parts, or organs; and it has functions and aim-directed\nbehaviors not present in them. Hence, organisms are mechanically\ninexplicable. Ginsborg (2004) construes Kant\u2019s claim along\ndifferent lines, in two senses. According to one, to explain something\nmechanically is to show that its production results, or would result,\nfrom the \u201cunaided powers of matter as such,\u201d i.e.\nNewtonian forces of attraction and repulsion, and \u201ccrude\nunorganized matter,\u201d or arbitrary initial conditions such as\nmasses, charges, configurations and motions. Organisms are\ninexplicable in this sense because their arising would be \u201cin\nthe highest degree contingent.\u201d This is the notion operative in\nthe Antinomy of Teleological Judgment, Ginsborg contends. But, she has\nargued, there is a second, stronger sense. Not only are organisms\ninexplicable by reduction to the structure and powers of their\norgans\u2014rather, their symmetries and regularities and powers are\nnot explicable from the \u201cmoving forces\u201d of their\ninorganic particles either. Organism-level powers are not\nvector sums or integrals of physico-chemical forces that accelerate or\nreconfigure sub-visible particles.\n\nSecond, interpreters have also scrutinized the exact nature of the\nAntinomy. Insofar as the thesis and the antithesis are regulative\nprinciples, they may be seen as research policies, and those can be\npursued separately, at different times, hence with no\ncontradiction. Then why are they antinomic? Watkins (2009, \u00a7 2.2)\nexplains that the two theses do not just recommend explanatory\npolicies but express commitments to judging in a determinate way about\nbiological phenomena. As such, they would be contradictory\ncommitments: to judge organisms purely mechanistically and to\njudge them non-mechanistically. Teufel (2011) reads the two theses as\nhypothetical imperatives, imposed upon reflective judgment by\npractical reason. The Antinomy ensues, he contends, because they\ndemand contradictory courses of cognitive conduct: to judge that\nmechanistic laws suffice to explain organisms and that they\nare insufficient for that task.\n\nMoreover, for each antinomy in the Critique of Pure Reason,\nKant derives both thesis and antithesis by deductive argument from\nalleged a priori premises. But, in the Antinomy of Teleological\nJudgment, he does not take that route. This makes quite pressing the\nquestion of his justification for the two R-claims above. As to the\nR-thesis, one might think that it can be easily deduced from\nKant\u2019s three Laws of Mechanics. However, we must remember that\nthose laws are constitutive principles, whereas the R-thesis is\nregulative. A better interpretive avenue is that Kant\u2019s three\nlaws constrain the spectrum of particular empirical laws, including\nlaws for biology, that scientists may seek. The constraint is that the\nLaws of Mechanics are basic: no other laws of material nature explain\nor ground them, while they must explain all other laws,\ndirectly or indirectly. So, for biological regularities to be turned\ninto genuine laws, they must be integrable with the system of already\nknown mechanical laws, and ultimately explained by the three Laws of\nMechanics, the basis for all \u201cinterconnected experiential\ncognition\u201d (5: 386). Even less well understood is Kant\u2019s\njustification for the R-antithesis. Not only is there no official\nproof, it is not easy to know what the proof must establish. The\nR-thesis strongly implies that at issue is the origin of\norganisms; in contrast, the R-antithesis is about judging their\npossibility, which has to do with structure and functioning\nnot production (Ginsborg 2001, 236). These are different aspects of\norganisms, and proving that they are mechanically inexplicable would\nrequire different arguments.\n\nThird, Kant\u2019s solution to the Antinomy has received sustained\nattention. In the first two Critiques, his general approach is to\nargue, for each antinomy, that both thesis and antithesis presuppose\nTranscendental Realism, insofar as they make claims about things in\nthemselves; and to adduce Transcendental Idealism as the vantage point\nfrom which the initial contradiction is solved. However, that is not\nKant\u2019s approach to the Antinomy of Teleological Judgment.\nAccordingly, interpreters have sought to reconstruct a different\nsolution on Kant\u2019s behalf. Quarfood (2004) and F\u00f6rster\n(2008) take the notion of an intuitive understanding (expounded at 5:\n401\u201310) as the key to Kant\u2019s answer. In particular,\nF\u00f6rster explains, intellects like ours are discursive: they grasp\nobjects through concepts as \u2018parts\u2019 assembled in\ntemporally-extended judgments, and so mechanistically, he alleges.\nHence, we need the concept \u2018purpose\u2019 to judge organisms\nsolely because we have discursive intellects. However, an intuitive\nunderstanding could grasp organisms without purpose-concepts and\nregulative principles about judging teleologically. Hence, for this\nunderstanding, the R-thesis and R-antithesis need not be true, and so\nno antinomy arises. Breitenbach (2008) contends that the Antinomy is\nsolved, or rather dissolved, if we note that thesis and antithesis are\nnot really contradictory but complementary. They govern (reflecting)\nacts of judging in different contexts: the mechanistic R-thesis\nregulates explanatory conduct in empirical biology, whereas the\nR-antithesis governs ordinary judging about living nature as\nexperienced in everyday, pre-theoretical encounters with it. The two\nprinciples epitomize \u201ctwo different views on nature,\u201d and\nare compossible (466). They just appear to be in contradiction; in\nfact, they complement each other, indispensably. McLaughlin (1990)\nsubmits that the Antinomy does not arise simpliciter but only\nunder a special assumption, viz. that everything in nature is\nobjectively explainable by us (162). Reject the assumption, and the\ncontradiction vanishes, insofar as the R-thesis and the R-antithesis\ncan both be true, but for different domains: the former holds for\nphenomena explainable by us, the latter for phenomena not so\nexplainable. McLaughlin does not offer a general criterion for\n\u2018explicability by us\u2019 attributable to Kant, however, apart\nfrom mechanical explicability. Ginsborg (2008) focuses on how the\ncontradiction might be resolved in the context of scientific\ninvestigation rather than in abstract, general philosophical terms.\nBuilding on Kant\u2019s remark about subordinating mechanism to\nteleology (5: 414), Ginsborg contends that natural historians and\nphysiologists may well explain the origin and workings of organisms\n\u2018mechanistically,\u2019 purely by physico-chemical laws,\nprovided they apply them not to \u201ccrude\u201d but to\n\u201corganized\u201d matter, i.e. organic stuff already endowed\nwith a \u201cformative drive,\u201d a generic disposition to grow,\nreproduce and self-maintain. In turn, this organized matter itself is\nunintelligible without appeal to purpose and design terms. Thus,\nbiologists \u2018subordinate\u2019 mechanism to teleology, and so\nthe antinomic conflict between them is removed.\n\nWhile these interpretive proposals collectively advance our\nunderstanding of how the Antinomy might be defused, each has its share\nof philosophical difficulties, as spelled out in Watkins (2009).\nMoreover, few of these construals heed close to Kant\u2019s words,\nwhich suggest strongly that his solution relies indispensably\non a \u201csupersensible ground\u201d (5: 413), or explanatory\nprinciple located in the noumenal world. That ground could\nunite both mechanism and teleology, by making both antinomic theses\njointly derivable or explainable from it. However, since humans can\nhave \u201cno positive determinate\u201d knowledge of any\nsupersensible entity, the Antinomy is solvable in principle rather\nthan solved in fact. Kant (at least in his official solution) does not\nseem to provide the details for an actual account of how the conflict\nat the heart of biological explanation is removed. The limitations\nthat beset our understanding of Kant\u2019s philosophy of biology so\nfar, some of which we have expounded above, continue to drive\ninterpretive efforts to cast more light on that part of his doctrine,\nas exemplified in Goy and Watkins (forthcoming).\n\nIn addition to the works mentioned above, Kant\u2019s Antinomy of\nTeleological Judgment has been usefully discussed in Allison (1991),\nCohen (2004), Ginsborg (2001), Kreines (2005), Steigerwald (2006),\nZanetti (1993) and Zumbach (1984); see also the entry\n\u201cKant\u2019s Aesthetics and Teleology\u201d in this\nencyclopedia.\n6. Chemistry\n\nKant draws a distinction between \u2018proper\u2019 and\n\u2018rational\u2019 science. The former denotes any discipline that\nis strongly mathematized and relies on \u2018apodictic\u2019 laws,\nsupported by conclusive evidence; Newton\u2019s gravitation theory is\nthe epitome of that. The latter indicates a body of propositions that\nis systematic, viz. explanatorily integrated, and includes laws. Kant\ncounted chemistry as a poster child for it. He lived through a\nwatershed change in that discipline\u2014from Georg Stahl\u2019s\nphlogiston theory to Lavoisier\u2019s renovation of chemistry, its\ncore processes, and taxonomy of stuffs.\n\nIn Metaphysical Foundations, Kant argued that, in a\n\u2018proper\u2019 science, its basic concepts correlate with\nmathematical notions, and the warrant for that correlation comes from\nmetaphysics, e.g. via a picture of the essence of matter. Thereby,\nmetaphysics supplies principles for the construction\u2019 of the\ndomain-specific concepts of that science. But, he continued, no such\nmetaphysical warrant is available for correlating basic\nchemical concepts with mathematics; when such correlations\noccur, they are known a posteriori. (He was aware, of course, that\nchemical practice in his time had discovered quantitative facts, e.g.\nabout the ratios of reagents in a specific reaction.) Thus, he\nconcluded, not only is chemistry not a proper science, but it is not\nlikely to become one ever (4:471).\n\nStill, he counted it as a \u2018rational\u2019 science: he thought\nchemistry owes its systematic order to ideas of reason. Specifically,\nto certain domain-specific artificial concepts introduced for the sake\nof descriptive and explanatory unification of many local regularities\nestablished empirically. For instance, that all solid metals then\nknown \u2018calcinate,\u2019 i.e. form heavier compounds when heated\nin air; and can be obtained from these compounds, under the right\nlaboratory conditions.\n\nAfter 1790, Kant apparently moved to endorse Lavoisier\u2019s new\ntaxonomy of chemical substances, and also his picture of the\n\u2018caloric,\u2019 or \u2018ether\u2019\u2014a species of\n\u2018imponderable fluid\u2019 endowed with causal properties\nrelevant to, among others, heat exchanges, \u2018combustion\u2019\n(oxidoreduction) and phase transitions. And yet, as recent research\nhas established, even in the post-Critical years Kant held fast to his\nabove requirements for a science to count as proper. In light of that,\nlate-Enlightenment chemistry\u2014Lavoisier\u2019s great\ntransformation and Kant\u2019s \u2018ether deduction\u2019\nnotwithstanding\u2014still counted for him as a rational, but\nimproper, science.\n\nInterest in Kant\u2019s philosophy of chemistry has surged in the\nlast decade. McNulty (2014, 2015, 2016) is an especially helpful and\nclear series of studies of Kant\u2019s engagement with that\nrapidly-changing science. Blomme (2023) contributes to the question of\nwhat chemistry was, for Kant. Older discussions of his views on the\ntopic are Carrier (1990, 2001) and Friedman (1992).\n7. Psychology\n\nKant\u2019s views on psychology are intimately bound up with his more\ngeneral position in the philosophy of mind (see the separate entry on\nthis topic.) He distinguishes between rational and empirical\npsychology and, in the Critique of Pure Reason\u2019s\nParalogisms, denies that rational psychology contains arguments that\ncould justify any substantive principles (especially concerning our\nimmortality). Thus, only empirical psychology, it seems, could be\npossible as a science. However, if Kant continues to maintain that\nscience requires a pure part, and denies that rational psychology\ncontains any substantive knowledge that might constitute the pure part\nof psychology, then it follows that empirical psychology cannot\nqualify as science proper either.\n\nAnd yet, he did not count it as a proper science either. If we ask\nwhy, we can discern two broad answers in the secondary literature.\nOlder interpretations thought it was because mathematization (a mark\nof \u2018proper\u2019 science) is not feasible in psychology.\nSupposedly, it is because psychic phenomena are in time\u2014it is\ntheir ordering structure, or a priori form\u2014and time qua form\nlacks enough features to support strong mathematization. (It is a\n1-dimensional manifold representable as a line: too narrow to support\nconstructions in pure intuition, which mathematization would require.)\nA more recent construal has it that empirical psychology lacks genuine\nlaws. Kant leaves open the prospect for it coming to have \u2018laws\nof association,\u2019 viz. knowledge of patterns of constant\nconjunction between some of our inner representations. Such patterns,\ndiscoverable by introspection, may resemble laws properly so-called.\nBut, as some have argued recently, that is not enough. Genuine laws\nrequire stronger warrant\u2014primarily, evidence from successful\nprediction confirmed by experiment or from precise observations. That\nsort of evidence, interpreters believe, is not available in empirical\npsychology. Which makes it an improper science by Kant\u2019s lights:\neven more improper than chemistry, which arguably does avail itself of\ngenuine laws explicated as above. A scholar who endorses the first\nreading above is Hatfield 1992; for the second, see especially McNulty\n2014.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Kant influenced empirical theory in early 19th-century\nGermany. (However, it was his transcendental psychology in the\nCritique of Pure Reason, not his views on empirical\npsychology, that proved to be most influential.) In particular, his\ndoctrine of space and time as forms of sensibility was given a\nnaturalistic construal in the physiology and psychology of perception.\nSince for Kant an a priori form of intuition need not be innate, it\ncould unfold in the course of sensory experience. This led J.G.\nSteinbuch (1811) and C. Th. Tourtual (1827) to investigate empirically\nhow spatial representation arises\u2014specifically, how particular\nsubjects become able to see things as arrayed in space, perceive\nobjects as three-dimensional, and represent spatial structures more\ngenerally.\n\nHatfield (1990, Chapter 4) surveys these post-Kantian developments in\nmore detail. Kitcher (1990) presents a detailed argument for the role\nof transcendental psychology within Kant\u2019s Critique of Pure\nReason. Sturm (2001) argues that Kant\u2019s critical comments\nabout psychology are primarily directed against introspection-based\nconceptions of psychology.\n8. Other Sciences: History, Physical Geography, and Anthropology\n\nThough Kant is sometimes quite strict about what qualifies as science\n\u201cproper,\u201d we have seen that he clearly accepts that other\ndisciplines, such as chemistry and psychology, can be scientific in\nsome other sense. (Kant is also extremely interested in providing an\nexplanation of the nature and origin of organisms, which is central to\nan account of biology. For a more detailed description of Kant\u2019s\nstance on biology, see the entry on his views on aesthetics and\nteleology.) However, his explicit reflections about science (taken\nbroadly so as to encompass not only\n\u201cWissenschaft\u201d but any kind of\n\u201cLehre\u201d or \u201cKunde\u201d) extend\neven further so as to include bodies of cognition such as history,\nphysical geography, and anthropology. (Even in the Metaphysical\nFoundations Kant leaves room for such \u201cscientific\ncognition\u201d by dividing the doctrine of nature into natural\nscience \u2014 e.g., physics \u2014 and the historical doctrine of\nnature, which is separated further into natural description and\nnatural history, 4:468). In the case of historical sciences, Kant\nviews its cognitions as related not by subordination (as is the case\nin physics), but rather by coordination, since historical facts cannot\nbe derived from each other, but rather merely related to each other in\nspace (geographically) and time (chronologically). Kant views\nanthropology as overlapping to some extent in subject matter with\nempirical psychology. What enables the coordination of facts in each\nof these domains is not a theoretical, but rather a practical idea. In\nthe case of history, it is the idea of reason (or freedom) that\nprovides a guiding principle of coordination (cf. Kant\u2019s\n\u201cIdea for a Universal History from a Cosmopolitan Point of\nView\u201d), while anthropology is framed by the cosmopolitan moral\nideal of the world-best. Thus, it is clear that Kant\u2019s emphasis\non physics throughout his career did not blind him to the value of\nother sciences, nor did it keep him from reflecting creatively on how\nbest to account for them from the perspective of his Critical\nphilosophy.\n\nKant\u2019s views on history are discussed by Yovel (1980) and, more\nrecently, Kleingeld (1995 and 1999). Kant\u2019s Physical\nGeography has been discussed by Adickes (1911). Brandt (1999),\nWood (1999), and Makkreel (2001) have recently published important\ndiscussions of Kant\u2019s anthropology. Sturm (2009) is a\ncomprehensive monograph on Kant\u2019s philosophy of psychology and\nanthropology.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Adickes, E., 1911, <em>Untersuchungen zu Kants Physischer\nGeographie</em>, T\u00fcbingen: Mohr.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1920, <em>Kants Opus postumum, dargestellt\nund beurteilt</em>, Berlin: Reuther &amp; Reichard.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1924\u20135, <em>Kant als\nNaturforscher</em>, (2 vols.)
