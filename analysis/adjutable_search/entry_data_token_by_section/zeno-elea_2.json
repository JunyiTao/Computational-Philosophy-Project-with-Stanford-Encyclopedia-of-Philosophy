    "main_text": "The Extant Paradoxes || The Arguments Against Plurality\n2.1 The Arguments Against Plurality\n2.1.1 The Antinomy of Limited and Unlimited\n\n\nIn his commentary on book 1 of Aristotle\u2019s Physics, the\nAlexandrian Neoplatonist Simplicius (6th c. C.E.) quotes verbatim\nZeno\u2019s argument that if there are many things, they are limited and\nunlimited, as follows: \u201cIf there are many things, it is\nnecessary that they be just so many as they are and neither greater\nthan themselves nor fewer. But if they are just as many as they are,\nthey will be limited. If there are many things, the things that are\nare unlimited; for there are always others between these entities, and\nagain others between those. And thus the things that are are\nunlimited\u201d (Zeno fr. 3 DK, i.e., Simp. in\nPh. 140.29\u201333 Diels). This is the only Zenonian antinomy\nthat has the appearance of being preserved in its entirety.\n\n\nThe argument here may be reconstructed as follows. Its overall \nstructure is: If there are many things, then there must be finitely \nmany things; and if there are many things, then there must be \ninfinitely many things. The assumption that there are many things is \nthus supposed to have been shown to lead to contradiction, namely, \nthat things are both finitely and infinitely many. The particular \nargument for the first arm of the antinomy seems to be simply: If \nthere are many things, then they must be just so many as they are. If\nthe many things are just so many as they are, they must be finitely \nmany. Therefore, if there are many things, then there must be \nfinitely many things. Simplicius somewhat loosely describes the \nantinomy\u2019s second arm as demonstrating numerical infinity through \ndichotomy (Simp. in Ph. 140.33\u20134). In fact, the argument \ndepends on a postulate specifying a necessary condition upon two \nthings being distinct, rather than on division per se, and \nit may be reconstructed as follows: If there are many things, they \nmust be distinct, that is, separate from one another. Postulate: Any \ntwo things will be distinct or separate from one another only if \nthere is some other thing between them. Two representative things, \nx1 and x2, will be distinct \nonly if there is some other thing, x3, between \nthem. In turn, x1 and x3 will\nbe distinct only if there is some other thing, \nx4, between them. Since the postulate can be \nrepeatedly applied in this manner unlimited times, between any two \ndistinct things there will be limitlessly many other things. \nTherefore, if there are many things, then there must be limitlessly \nmany things.\n2.1.2 The  Antinomy of Large and Small\n\n\nIn the same stretch of his commentary on Aristotle\u2019s \nPhysics, Simplicius reports at length one of Zeno\u2019s numerous\narguments designed to show how the claim that there are many things \nleads to contradiction. \u201cOne of these,\u201d Simplicius says, \n\u201cis the argument in which he demonstrates that if there are \nmany things, they are both large and small: so large as to be \nunlimited in magnitude, and so small as to have no magnitude. Indeed,\nin this argument he shows that what has neither magnitude nor \nthickness nor bulk would not even exist. \u2018For if\u2019, he \nsays, \u2018it were added to another entity, it would not make it \nany larger; for since it is of no magnitude, when it is added, there \ncannot be any increase in magnitude. And so what was added would just\nbe nothing. But if when it is taken away the other thing will be no \nsmaller, and again when it is added the other thing will not \nincrease, it is clear that what was added and what was taken away was\nnothing\u2019\u201d (Zeno fr. 2 DK = Simp. in Ph. \n139.7\u201315). After thus quoting this portion of the argument, \nSimplicius continues: \u201cZeno says this because each of the many \nthings has magnitude and is infinite [reading apeiron \ninstead of ms. apeir\u00f4n], given that something is \nalways in front of whatever is taken, in virtue of infinite division;\nthis he shows after first demonstrating that none have magnitude on \nthe grounds that each of the many is the same as itself and \none\u201d (Simp. in Ph. 139.16\u201319). Soon after this, \nSimplicius records the argument for unlimited magnitude he has \nalluded to in the first part of the passage just quoted, as follows: \n\u201cInfinity in respect of magnitude he earlier proves in the same\nway. For having first shown that, if what is does not have magnitude,\nit would not even exist, he continues: \u2018But if it is, each must\nhave some magnitude and thickness, and one part of it must extend \naway from another. And the same account applies to the part out \nahead. For that part too will have magnitude and will have part of it\nout ahead. Indeed, it is the same to say this once as always to keep \nsaying it; for no such part of it will be last, nor will one part not\nbe related to another. Thus if there are many things, they must be \nboth small and large, so small as to have no magnitude, and so large \nas to be unlimited\u2019\u201d (Zeno fr. 1 DK, = Simp. in \nPh. 140.34\u2013141.8). \n\n\nSimplicius only alludes to Zeno\u2019s argument for smallness, without \nsetting it out: he says that Zeno derived the conclusion that \n\u201cnone have magnitude on the grounds that each of the many is \nthe same as itself and one.\u201d Although this is not much to go \non, the argument may plausibly be reconstructed as follows. Each of \nthe many is the same as itself and one. Whatever has magnitude can be\ndivided into distinguishable parts; whatever has distinguishable \nparts is not everywhere the same as itself; thus, whatever has \nmagnitude is not everywhere, and so is not genuinely, the same as \nitself. Whatever is not the same as itself is not genuinely one. \nThus, whatever has magnitude is not genuinely one. Therefore, each of\nthe many has no magnitude. The basic assumption here is that to be \n\u201cthe same as itself\u201d is what it means for something to be\n\u201cone\u201d in the strict sense Zeno envisages, whereas any \nmagnitude, which will have distinguishable parts in virtue of being \nspatially extended, will fail to be strictly one and self-identical. \n\n\nThe evidence in Simplicius indicates that Zeno then transitioned to \nthe antinomy\u2019s other arm, the unlimited largeness of things, via the \nfollowing lemma: since what has no magnitude would be nothing, each \nof the many must have some magnitude. Simplicius\u2019s report of how Zeno\nspecifically argued for the second arm\u2019s conclusion, that each of the\nmany is of unlimited magnitude, pertains primarily to its apparent \nsub-argument for the interim conclusion that each thing has \nlimitlessly many parts, which ran as follows. Each of the many has \nsome magnitude and thickness (from the lemma). Whatever has some \nmagnitude and thickness will have (distinguishable) parts, so that \neach of the many will have parts. If x is one of the many, \nthen x will have parts. Since each of these parts of \nx has some magnitude and thickness, each of these parts will\nhave its own parts, and these parts will in turn have parts of their \nown, and so on, and so on, without limit. Thus each of the many will \nhave a limitless number of parts. Whether or not Zeno then made \nexplicit how the antinomy\u2019s final conclusion followed from this, here\nis a plausible reconstruction of the rest of the reasoning was \npresumably supposed to go: Every part of each thing has some \nmagnitude; the magnitude of any object is equal to the sum of the \nmagnitudes of its parts; and the sum of limitlessly many parts of \nsome magnitude is a limitless magnitude. Therefore, the magnitude of \neach of the many is limitless. \n\n\nTaken as a whole, then, this elaborate tour de force of an \nargument purports to have shown that, if there are many things, each \nof them must have simultaneously no magnitude and unlimited \nmagnitude.\n",
