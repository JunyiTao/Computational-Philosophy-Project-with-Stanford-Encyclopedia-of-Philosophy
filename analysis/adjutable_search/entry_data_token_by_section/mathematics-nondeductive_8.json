    "main_text": "Alternative Non-deductive Methods || Enumerative Induction\n3.2 Enumerative Induction\n\nIn a letter to Euler written in 1742, Christian Goldbach conjectured\nthat all even numbers greater than 2 are expressible as the sum of two\n primes.[7]\n Over the following two and a half centuries, mathematicians have been\nunable to prove Goldbach\u2019s Conjecture. However it has been\nverified for many billions of examples, and there appears to be a\nconsensus among mathematicians that the conjecture is most likely\ntrue. Below is a partial list (as of October 2007) showing the order\nof magnitude up to which all even numbers have been checked and shown\nto conform to GC.\n\n\nBound\nDate\nAuthor\n\n1 \u00d7 103\n1742\nEuler\n\n1 \u00d7 104\n1885\nDesboves\n\n1 \u00d7 105\n1938\nPipping\n\n1 \u00d7 108\n1965\nStein & Stein\n\n2 \u00d7 1010\n1989\nGranville\n\n1 \u00d7 1014\n1998\nDeshouillers\n\n1 \u00d7 1018\n2007\nOliveira & Silva\n\n\nDespite this vast accumulation of individual positive instances of GC,\naided since the early 1960s by the introduction\u2014and subsequent\nrapid increases in speed\u2014of the digital computer, no proof of GC\nhas yet been found. Not only this, but few number theorists are\noptimistic that there is any proof in the offing. Fields medalist Alan\nBaker stated in a 2000 interview: \u201cIt is unlikely that we will\nget any further [in proving GC] without a big breakthrough.\nUnfortunately there is no such big idea on the horizon.\u201d Also in\n2000, publishers Faber and Faber offered a $1,000,000 prize to anyone\nwho proved GC between March 20 2000 and March 20 2002, confident that\ntheir money was relatively safe.\n\nWhat makes this situation especially interesting is that\nmathematicians have long been confident in the truth of GC. Hardy\n& Littlewood asserted, back in 1922, that \u201cthere is no\nreasonable doubt that the theorem is correct,\u201d and Echeverria,\nin a recent survey article, writes that \u201cthe certainty of\nmathematicians about the truth of GC is complete\u201d (Echeverria\n1996, 42). Moreover this confidence in the truth of GC is typically\nlinked explicitly to the inductive evidence: for instance, G.H. Hardy\ndescribed the numerical evidence supporting the truth of GC as\n\u201coverwhelming.\u201d Thus it seems reasonable to conclude that\nthe grounds for mathematicians\u2019 belief in GC is the enumerative\ninductive evidence.\n\nOne distinctive feature of the mathematical case which may make a\ndifference to the justificatory power of enumerative induction is the\nimportance of order. The instances falling under a given mathematical\nhypothesis (at least in number theory) are intrinsically ordered, and\nfurthermore position in this order can make a crucial difference to\nthe mathematical properties involved. As Frege writes, with regard to\nmathematics:\n\n[T]he ground [is] unfavorable for induction; for here there is none of\nthat uniformity which in other fields can give the method a high\ndegree of reliability. (Frege, Foundations of Arithmetic)\n\n\nFrege then goes on to quote Leibniz, who argues that difference in\nmagnitude leads to all sorts of other relevant differences between the\nnumbers:\n\nAn even number can be divided into two equal parts, an odd number\ncannot; three and six are triangular numbers, four and nine are\nsquares, eight is a cube, and so on. (Frege, Foundations of\nArithmetic)\n\n\nFrege also explicitly compares the mathematical and non-mathematical\ncontexts for induction:\n\nIn ordinary inductions we often make good use of the proposition that\nevery position in space and every moment in time is as good in itself\nas every other. \u2026 Position in the number series is not a matter\nof indifference like position in space. (Frege, Foundations of\nArithmetic)\n\n\nAs Frege\u2019s remarks suggest, one way to underpin an argument\nagainst the use of enumerative induction in mathematics is via some\nsort of non-uniformity principle: in the absence of proof, we\nshould not expect numbers (in general) to share any interesting\nproperties. Hence establishing that a property holds for some\nparticular number gives no reason to think that a second, arbitrarily\nchosen number will also have that\n property.[8]\n Rather than the Uniformity Principle which Hume suggests is the only\nway to ground induction, we have almost precisely the opposite\nprinciple! It would seem to follow from this principle that\nenumerative induction is unjustified, since we should not expect\n(finite) samples from the totality of natural numbers to be indicative\nof universal properties.\n\nA potentially even more serious problem, in the case of GC and in all\nother cases of induction in mathematics, is that the sample we are\nlooking at is biased. Note first that all known\ninstances of GC (and indeed all instances it is possible to know)\nare\u2014in an important sense\u2014small.\n\nIn a very real sense, there are no large numbers: Any explicit integer\ncan be said to be \u201csmall\u201d. Indeed, no matter how many\ndigits or towers of exponents you write down, there are only finitely\nmany natural numbers smaller than your candidate, and infinitely many\nthat are larger (Crandall and Pomerance 2001, 2).\n\n\nOf course, it would be wrong to simply complain that all instances of\nGC are finite. After all, every number is finite, so if GC\nholds for all finite numbers than GC holds\n simpliciter.[9]\n But we can isolate a more extreme sense of smallness, which might be\ntermed minuteness.\n\nDefinition: a positive integer, n, is minute just in\ncase n is within the range of numbers we can write down using\nordinary decimal notation, including (non-iterated) exponentiation.\n\n\nVerified instances of GC to date are not just small, they are minute.\nAnd minuteness, though admittedly rather vaguely defined, is known to\nmake a difference. Consider, for example, the logarithmic estimate of\nprime density (i.e. the proportion of numbers less than a given\nn that are prime) which is known to become an underestimate\nfor large enough n. Let n* be the first\nnumber for which the logarithmic estimate is too small. If the Riemann\nHypothesis is true, then it can be proven that an upper bound for\nn* (the first Skewes number) is 8 \u00d7\n10370. Though an impressively large number, it is\nnonetheless minute according to the above definition. However if the\nRiemann Hypothesis is false than our best known upper bound for\nn* (the second Skewes number) is\n 10\u219110\u219110\u219110\u21913.[10]\n The necessity of inventing an \u2018arrow\u2019 notation here to\nrepresent this number tells us that it is not minute. The second part\nof this result, therefore, although admittedly conditional on a result\nthat is considered unlikely (viz. the falsity of RH), implies that\nthere is a property which holds of all minute numbers but does not\nhold for all numbers. Minuteness can make a difference.\n\nWhat about the seeming confidence that number theorists have in the\ntruth of GC? Echeverria (1996) discusses the important role played by\nCantor\u2019s publication, in 1894, of a table of values of the\nGoldbach partition function, G(n), for n = 2 to\n1,000 (Echeverria 1996,29\u201330). The partition function measures\nthe number of distinct ways in which a given (even) number can be\nexpressed as the sum of two primes. Thus G(4) = 1, G(6) = 1, G(8) = 1,\nG(10) = 2, etc. This shift of focus onto the partition function\ncoincided with a dramatic increase in mathematicians\u2019 confidence\nin GC. What became apparent from Cantor\u2019s work is that\nG(n) tends to increase as n increases. Note that\nwhat GC amounts to in this context is that G(n) never takes\nthe value 0 (for any even n greater than 2). The overwhelming\nimpression made by data on the partition function is that it\nis highly unlikely for GC to fail for some large n. For\nexample, for numbers on the order of 100,000, there is always at least\n500 distinct ways to express each even number as the sum of two\nprimes!\n\nHowever, as it stands these results are purely heuristic. The thirty\nyears following Cantor\u2019s publication of his table of values\n(described by Echeverria as the \u201c2nd period\u201d of\nresearch into GC) saw numerous attempts to find an analytic expression\nfor G(n). If this could be done then it would presumably be\ncomparatively straightforward to prove that this analytic function\nnever takes the value 0 (Echeverria 1996, 31). By around 1921,\npessimism about the chances of finding such an expression led to a\nchange of emphasis, and mathematicians started directing their\nattention to trying to find lower bounds for G(n). This too\nhas proved unsuccessful, at least to date.\n\nThus consideration of the partition function has not brought a proof\nof GC any closer. However it does allow us to give an interesting\ntwist to the argument of the previous section. The graph suggests that\nthe hardest test cases for GC are likely to occur among the smallest\nnumbers; hence the inductive sample for GC is biased, but it\nis biased against the chances of GC. Mathematicians\u2019\nconfidence in the truth of GC is not based purely on enumerative\ninduction. The values taken by the partition function indicate that\nthe sample of positive instances of GC is indeed biased, and biased\nsamples do not\u2014as a general rule\u2014lend much support to an\nhypothesis. But in this particular case the nature of the bias makes\nthe evidence stronger, not weaker. So it is possible to argue that\nenumerative induction is unjustified while simultaneously agreeing\nthat mathematicians are rational to believe GC on the basis of the\navailable evidence. (Note that there is a delicate balance to maintain\nhere because evidence for the behavior of the partition function is\nitself non-deductive. However the impression that G(n) is\nlikely to be bounded below by some increasing analytic function is not\nbased on enumerative induction per se, so the\njustification\u2014while non-deductive\u2014is not circular.)\n\nThe upshot of the above discussion, albeit based on a single case\nstudy, is that mathematicians ought not to\u2014and in general do\nnot\u2014give weight to enumerative induction per se in the\njustification of mathematical claims. (To what extent enumerative\ninduction plays a role in the discovery of new hypotheses, or in the\nchoice of what open problems mathematicians decide to work on, is a\nseparate issue which has not been addressed here.) More precisely, the\nthesis is in two parts:\n\nEnumerative induction ought not to increase\nconfidence in universal mathematical generalizations (over an infinite\ndomain).\nEnumerative induction does not (in general) lead\nmathematicians to be more confident in the truth of the conclusion of\nsuch generalizations.\n\n",
