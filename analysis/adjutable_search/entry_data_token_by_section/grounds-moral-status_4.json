    "main_text": "What Is Full Moral Status (FMS)? || Strong Reason to Treat Fairly\n2.3 Strong Reason to Treat Fairly\n\nWhile this is even less commonly explicitly associated with FMS, some\nviews emphasize that comparable interests of beings with FMS matter\nequally in moral decisions, giving rise to strong reasons to treat\nsuch beings fairly (Broome 1990\u20131991 and Jaworska 2007). For\nexample, when distrib\u00aduting goods among such beings, in\ncircumstances when they can all benefit similarly, barring special\npurposes, relationships, or independent claims on the goods, we have\nstrong reason to distribute the goods equally (or in another way\nthat\u2019s fair, depending on the account of fairness). In some\ncases one will be distributing goods that meet needs and in other\ncases the goods being distributed are not needed, but will\nnevertheless be useful or appreciated. In either case, there is a\nstrong reason to distribute the goods fairly among beings with FMS.\nThis reason does not necessarily apply to beings that lack FMS; for\nexample, a farmer need not worry about being fair in distributing food\nto his cows and chickens.\n",
