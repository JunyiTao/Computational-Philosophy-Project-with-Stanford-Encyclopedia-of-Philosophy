    "main_text": "\n1. Special Obligations and Consequentialism\n\nWhat is special about special obligations? One way to answer\nthis question is to contrast special obligations with some type of\nduty or obligation that is not special. One example of such a\n\u2018non-special\u2019 type of duty or obligation is that\nrecognized by consequentialists. (Special obligations can also be\ncontrasted with another type of non-special duty. See section III).\nAccording to one version of consequentialism, the right action is that\naction which, of all alternatives available to the agent, produces the\ngreatest net sum of intrinsic value, where intrinsic value is value as\nan end or for its own sake and not merely as a means to something\nother than itself. (There are, of course, many forms of\nconsequentialism. The important feature of such views for our purposes\nis that they understand right action as a function of and solely of\nthe consequences (actual, probable, or possible) of the action and its\nalternatives. (The following discussion presupposes a version of\nactual consequence act-consequentialism. But the points made apply\nmutatis mutandis to other versions of consequentialism.)\n\nBut now consider how, according to the consequentialist, I ought to\ntreat my friends (or family members, or colleagues, \u2026). If my\nfriend\u2019s well-being is no more intrinsically valuable than the\nwell-being of any other person, then I ought to be impartial, at least\nin my actions, between promoting the good of my friend and promoting\nthe good of a complete stranger. Thus, the mere fact that someone is\nmy friend (or my mother, or my colleague, or my fellow citizen) does\nnot imply that I have any obligations to such a person that I do not\nhave to any and all persons. Similarly, the mere fact that I have\npromised someone to benefit her in some way does not, considered in\nitself, imply that I have any obligation to benefit that person: my\npromisee\u2019s good carries no greater weight than does the good of\nany other person. On the other hand, commonsense morality, in contrast\nwith consequentialism, seems to regard the mere fact that a person is\nmy friend or that I made a promise to that person as morally\nsignificant. For example, most people do not think that I am justified\nin breaking a promise merely because slightly more good would result\nfrom my breaking the promise than from my keeping the promise.\nSimilarly, most people think that if I have a choice between\nbenefitting a friend or providing an equal benefit to a stranger that\nI ought to benefit my friend. Consequentialism, in so far as it\ndiverges from commonsense morality on these points, strikes many as an\nunacceptable moral theory.\n\nOf course, the consequentialist has more than one possible reply to\nthese sorts of worries about her view. First, the consequentialist can\nargue that, in fact, each person acting so as to benefit her friends,\nloved ones, promisees, etc., will have the best overall consequences.\nPromising, for example, is an instrumentally valuable institution, and\neach of us should do her part to support that institution: one thing\nthat each of us can do is to keep her own promises. Promises also\ncreate expectations in their recipients, and the harm of unrealized\nexpectations or hopes needs to be taken into account when we consider\nwhether the breaking of a promise has better consequences than the\nkeeping of a promise. Similarly, each of us ought to take special care\nof her loved ones, because friendship is a valuable institution. Also,\nwe are well positioned to take care of our loved ones: our efforts are\nmore likely to be efficacious than if we were to attempt to benefit\npersons distant from us whom we do not know and people often\nexperience greater emotional harm when they are slighted by their\nintimates than when they are slighted by strangers. As John Stuart\nMill remarked in Utilitarianism, \u201c[f]ew hurts which human beings\ncan sustain are greater, and none wound more, than when that on which\nthey habitually and with full assurance relied fails them in the hour\nof need\u201d (59).\n\nIn The Methods of Ethics, Henry Sidgwick appealed to the\nconsiderations mentioned in the previous paragraph in an attempt\n\u201cto show that the commonly received view of special claims and\nduties arising out of special relations, though prima facie\nopposed to the impartial universality of the Utilitarian principle, is\nreally maintained by a well-considered application of that\nprinciple\u201d (439). Our \u2018natural benevolent\naffections\u2019 guide us to do good toward some small sector of\nhumankind (a small sector composed of our friends, promisees,\ncolleagues, family, etc.), and stifling such natural tendencies would\nleave only \u201ca very feeble counterpoise to self-love\u201d and\nthus little from which to develop a more extended and generalized\nbenevolence (434). Also, given the naturalness of certain affections,\nwe come to expect others to act on them, and so pain is caused by\ndeviations from these expectations (439). Thus, consequentialists have\nfor a long time been aware of the apparently counterintuitive\nimplications of their theory with respect to special obligations and\nbeen at pains to show that such implications are merely apparent.\n\nThis move, however, does not accommodate genuinely special\nobligations within a consequentialist view. The consequentialist\njustification for an agent\u2019s giving greater attention to the\nwell-being of her intimates is that her doing so will best promote\nintrinsic value. The reason that each of us has to promote the good of\nher intimates does not have any weight that counters the weight of our\nduty to maximize intrinsic value; rather, whatever weight our reason\nto promote the good of our intimates has, it has derivatively\nas a means of our fulfilling our fundamental or basic duty to maximize\nvalue. Whenever we can maximize value by ignoring our intimates or by\nbreaking a promise, then we, in such circumstances, have no even\nprima facie reasons to take care of our intimates or to keep\nour promises. Thus, on this account, the consequentialist secures only\nderivatively special obligations: reasons to take special\ncare of a select group of people that are derived from a more\ngeneral duty to care for all persons as such. Each agent has the same\nfundamental duty or reason to maximize value, but each of us, given\nour unique causal and epistemic position, ought to perform different\nactions in order to be fulfilling that fundamental shared duty.\n\nBut then, of course, whatever derivative reason an agent has to care\nfor her intimates is determined by the nature of her contingent,\nempirical circumstances. If I find myself causally and epistemically\npositioned to do greater good by ignoring my intimates and serving the\nneeds of strangers, then that is what I ought to do, according to the\nconsequentialist. In fact, if I have the choice of providing\nx units of good to my friend or x+1 units of good to\na complete stranger, then, barring any further long-run negative\neffects on my character, my friendship, or the institution of\nfriendship, I ought to provide the x+1 units of good to the\nstranger. Commonsense morality, however, as we have seen, regards the\nfact of my standing in the friendship relation to someone as morally\nsignificant in and of itself. In so far as the consequentialist is\nunable to grant friendship (or promising, etc.) any such independent\nmoral significance, it remains out of step with commonsense\nunderstanding of the status of special obligations.\n\nAnother move that the consequentialist can make is to claim that each\nperson taking care of her own intimates (or keeping her own promises)\nis an intrinsically valuable state of affairs. And my taking\ncare of my intimates is an essential part of this intrinsically\nvaluable state of affairs: it is not merely a contingent matter that\nI, rather than others, am better placed to promote it. Thus, it seems\nthat I have reason to take care of my intimates that no one else has,\nand I have no similar reason to take care of persons other than my\nintimates. But this too is only a derivatively special obligation: it\nis derived from the fundamental duty to maximize value. If I can\nproduce more value by promoting your taking care of\nyour intimates than by taking care of my own, then I ought to\ndo the former rather than the latter. Perhaps your intimate\nrelationships are more valuable than my own, and I could promote more\ngood by devoting myself to helping you to maintain your relationships\nto family, friends, colleagues, and promisees. In such circumstances,\nI ought to devote my resources to promoting your devotion to your\nintimates. My reason to pay special attention to certain persons\nprovides no independent counter-weight to my reason to maximize\noverall value: I must be, at bottom, impartial, at least in action, as\nbetween my own intimate relationships (or my own promises) and anyone\nelse\u2019s intimate relationships (or promises).\n\nPeter Railton has argued that a \u2018sophisticated\nconsequentialist\u2019 agent has reason to cultivate in himself\nmotivational dispositions that support the kinds of partiality that\ncommonsense views as necessary for friendship and other intimate\nrelationships. If moral agents were inclined to reason as\nstraightforward consequentialists, they would be unable to form\nloving, intimate relationships. Given the value of such relationships,\nagents will, in the long run, produce more overall good if they\ndispose themselves to benefit loved ones, even if such dispositions\nlead them, on occasion, to perform an action with less than optimal\nconsequences. Thus, good consequentialist agents are ones who guide\nthemselves to act as though they had special obligations to friends\nand other loved ones. (See Driver for an attempt to show how\nconsequentialism is not in tension with feminist concerns about\n\u201cpartiality and the demands of morality\u201d (197).)\n\nThe difficulty with Railton\u2019s strategy is in its ultimate\nevaluation of the action of a sophisticated consequentialist agent on\nthe occasion when he acts to benefit a loved one even though the\nconsequences of doing so are slightly less good than if he had acted\nto benefit a stranger instead. As Richard J. Arneson says, according\nto the sophisticated consequentialist, \u201cit can be morally right\nto form the intention to do what is morally wrong \u2026 Sometimes\none ought to become a friend, even though this involves disposing\noneself to do wrong, because forming this disposition would be acting\nto produce best consequences\u201d (394). Arneson is quite right to\npoint out that such a claim does not involve the consequentialist in\nany \u201cparadox or inconsistency\u201d (394). However, most people\nare reluctant to view friendship and the dispositions that it involves\nas inevitably an arena of wrongdoing, albeit blameless wrongdoing. If\nthis is the best that consequentialism can do for our reasons to take\nspecial care of friends and of loved ones \u2014 labeling such action\nas wrongdoing that is a byproduct of otherwise instrumentally valuable\ndispositions \u2014 then it seems that consequentialism simply cannot\ncapture our deep-rooted sense of our obligations arising from special\nrelationships. (See Jollimore 70\u201371.)\n2. Special Obligations and Agent-Relativity\n\nThe discussion of the previous section stressed that the alleged\ndifficulties that consequentialism has in accommodating the\ncommonsense understanding of special obligations arise from the fact\nthat the consequentialist can allow only derivatively, not genuinely,\nspecial obligations. Another way to express this point is to say that\nthe consequentialist allows only agent-neutral reasons, whereas\nspecial obligations, as understood by commonsense, are agent-relative\nreasons. Derek Parfit understands agent-neutral as opposed to\nagent-relative reasons in the following way:\n\nSuppose we claim that there is a reason to relieve some person\u2019s\nsuffering. This reason is objective if it is a reason for everyone\n\u2013 for anyone who could relieve this person\u2019s suffering. I\ncall such reasons agent-neutral. \u2026 When I call some reason\nagent-relative, I am not claiming that this reason cannot be a reason\nfor other agents. All that I am claiming is that it may not be (143).\n\n\nThomas Nagel explicates the difference between agent-neutral and\nagent-relative reasons in a slightly different way: \n\nIf a reason can be given a general form which does not include an\nessential reference to the person who has it, it is an \nagent-neutral  reason. For example, if it is a reason for anyone\nto do or want something that it would reduce the amount of\nwretchedness in the world, then that is a neutral reason. If on the\nother hand the general form of a reason does include an essential\nreference to the person who has it, it is an  agent-relative \nreason. For example, if it is a reason for anyone to do or want\nsomething that it would be in  his  interest, then that is a\nrelative reason. In such a case, if something were in Jones\u2019s\ninterest but contrary to Smith\u2019s, Jones would have reason to\nwant it to happen and Smith would have the same reason to want it not\nto happen (1986 152\u2013153).\n\n\nThus, special obligations would be understood by Parfit and Nagel as\nagent-relative reasons: my reason to take care of my friend by giving\nher encouraging words may not be shared by anyone else (even when in a\nposition which makes it possible for her to do that), and the\n\u201cform of the reason \u2026 include[s] an essential reference\nto the person who has it\u201d \u2013 I have reason to give my\nfriend encouraging words. \n\nWe can make Parfit\u2019s explanation of the distinction between\nagent-neutral reasons and agent-relative reasons more precise in the\nfollowing way:\n\nAgent-Neutral Reason: S\u2019s reason to do or to promote p is\nan agent-neutral reason if and only if, necessarily, for any Q,\nQ would also have that reason to do or to promote p if\nQ were in a causal position to do or to promote p. All\nother reasons are agent-relative.\n\n\nIt is important to see that an agent could have more than one reason\nto promote any given state of affairs, some of those reasons being\nagent-neutral, others agent-relative. Consider Peter\u2019s reasons\nto buy Mary a dinner that she will enjoy. If enjoyment or pleasure is\nintrinsically valuable, then Peter will reason R to buy Mary that\ndinner, where R is grounded or constituted by Mary\u2019s enjoyment\nof the dinner. If Paul, like Peter, is casually placed so as to be\nable to provide Mary with that intrinsically valuable enjoyment, then\nPaul also has reason R to do so. But now suppose that Peter is\nMary\u2019s friend. Defenders of special obligations of friendship\nare likely to claim that Peter also has reason R* to buy\nthat dinner for Mary, where R* is generated or grounded or\nconstituted by his friendship with Mary. If Paul is not Mary\u2019s\nfriend, then he does not stand in the friendship relation to her, and\nso he will not have reason R* (or any reason of that type)\nto buy Mary dinner, regardless of his causal placement. Thus,\nPeter\u2019s reason R* is an agent-relative reason,\nwhereas R was agent-neutral.\n\nNotice that on this definition of agent-neutrality and its\ncorrespondent definition of agent-relativity, nearness in space cannot\nbe an ultimate ground of an agent-relative reason. When we think of\nnearness affecting our moral obligations, it seems that it does so by\naffecting our causal efficacy in providing aid: we are standing on the\nbank of a river in which someone is drowning, someone has had a heart\nattack in the room where we are and we know CPR, etc. In all of these\ncases, if someone else had been in our spatial position, he or she\nwould have been in our causal position and so would have had the same\nduty to aid as we do. And spatial position does not seem to have any\nother significance beyond its effect on causal position. After all, if\nsomeone had been further away but able to push a button to activate a\nmachine that would save the one drowning, then she would have had the\nsame duty to aid as we did. (See Orsi for a discussion of nearness and\nobligations.) \n\nBut friendship and promising, for example, are not like spatial\nposition, i.e., it does not seem that the relevance of these\nrelationships is a matter of the parties to them being best causally\nsituated to provide aid. Even if a person who is wealthier than me is\nactually in a better position to aid my friend, it nonetheless seems\nto be the case that I have some reason to aid my friend that the\nperson at least as well or better causally situated to do so does not\nhave. She may have stronger agent-neutral reason to aid my friend, but\nshe does not have the agent-relative reason arising from friendship\nthat I have. \n\nDo we have such genuinely agent-relative special obligations? We can\nsee the difficulty in accepting special obligations through another\ncontrast, this one with natural duties as understood by commonsense\nmorality.\n3. Special Obligations and Natural Duties\n\nAlthough commonsense morality seems firmly committed to special\nobligations, and seems firmly committed to an understanding of such\nobligations that cannot be accommodated by consequentialism,\ndifficulties remain in trying to provide some grounds for such\nobligations. We can see these difficulties more clearly if we contrast\nspecial obligations with a type of duty recognized by commonsense\nmorality that is not special, i.e., natural duties. Natural duties are\n\u201cmoral requirements which apply to all men [and women]\nirrespective of status or of acts performed\u2026owed by all persons\nto all others\u201d (Simmons 1979, 13). It is plausible to suppose\nthat the fundamental or basic justification of why we have natural\nduties is the intrinsic nature of persons, i.e., the intrinsic nature\nof those to whom the duties are owed (moral patients). For example,\nconsider my duty to tell the person sitting next to me at a bar that\nJoe Schmoe slipped poison into her drink. It may seem to be the case\nthat I am morally required to tell only a limited class of people that\nsomeone has put poison into their drink, namely, the class consisting\nof the person sitting next to me right now whose drink is such that I\nknow that it is poisoned. However, the fundamental or basic\njustification for my having that duty is the nature of the person to\nwhom the duty is owed \u2013 she is rational, or sentient, or\n[substitute your preferred characterization of a moral patient]\n\u2013 and her nature is sufficient to ground the duty. My proximity\nto the person and my knowledge of the poison in her drink facilitate\nmy being able to fulfill my (natural) duty of mutual aid, but it is\nnot a part of the fundamental explanation of why I have such a duty in\nthe first place. So it is the nature of the action, i.e., warning the\nrelevant sort of being of imminent danger, that renders the action\nmorally required. Anyone else in the same causal and epistemic\nposition would similarly have a duty to warn of the poison in the\ndrink. I occupy no peculiar status or role and have performed no prior\nactions such that if I did not occupy that role or had not performed\nthose actions, I would have no duty to warn of the poison in the\ndrink.\n\nSpecial obligations, on the other hand, are owed not (necessarily) to\nall persons, but to some (possibly) limited class of\n persons,[1]\n where the fundamental or basic justification for the having of such\nobligations cannot be the intrinsic nature of the obligee as such (or,\nat least, not only the intrinsic nature of the obligee: the obligee\nmust have the requisite properties in order to qualify as a moral\npatient before she can be owed any obligations or duties at all.)\nAfter all, those to whom I owe special obligations are not necessarily\nmore worthy or needy (and are certainly not more sentient or rational)\nthan those to whom I do not owe any special obligations. Rather, the\nrelationship between me and my obligee is fundamental to any\nexplanation of my special obligations to that obligee. Consider, for\nexample, my obligation to keep my promise to you to remind you,\nwhenever you start to drink alcohol, that you have given it up for\nLent. The fundamental explanation of why I have an obligation to\nremind you that you have given up alcohol for Lent is not that you\nhave the requisite features to qualify as a moral patient in\nconjunction with the nature of the action of reminding persons when\nthey have given up alcohol as part of a religious commitment. My\nrelation to you (my status as defined by past action), i.e.that I have\nmade a promise to you, does not simply facilitate my fulfilling some\nmore general duty, but, rather, is part of the basic explanation of\nwhy I have the obligation to remind you of your commitment. (There are\ndifficulties with this specification of special obligations as opposed\nto natural duties. In order to remove the difficulties, one would need\nto explain why certain contingent features of persons such as causal\nposition are not partly constitutive of \u2018status\u2019 or best\nseen as a result of \u2018acts performed.\u2019 In other words, one\nwho intends to attribute to moral agents some type of genuinely\nspecial obligation owes an account of what sorts of status or position\nor what types of acts performed are such that, as a result of being in\nsuch a position or having performed such acts, one has obligations\nthat are not derived from some more general obligation that one has to\nall persons considered as\n such.[2]).\n\nAs I have said, common sense morality seems to regard persons as\nhaving certain special obligations, in particular, special obligations\nto one\u2019s friends, one\u2019s family, those persons to whom one\nhas made a promise, and one\u2019s fellow citizens. As I indicated in\nthe first section, appeal to these special obligations has often been\nused as a weapon against the consequentialist: persons have special\nobligations, consequentialism cannot accommodate such obligations,\ntherefore consequentialism is false. As I have said, the\nconsequentialist has attempted to show the ways in which she can\njustify our acting as though we have special obligations, but must\ndeny that we actually have any non-derivative special obligations. The\nconsequentialist can, at this point, join forces with any moral\ntheorist who accepts natural duties while rejecting special\nobligations. Consequentialists and defenders of natural duties base\nthe duties that they defend on some intrinsic feature of the state of\naffairs to be promoted or of the person to whom the duty is owed. They\ncan then press the defender of special obligations to offer some\naccount of the grounds of alleged non-derivative special obligations:\nwhy suppose that we have reasons to benefit some persons merely\nbecause of some special relationship that we stand in to those\npersons, our own status or position, or past actions that we have\nperformed?\n\nThis demand of the consequentialist is backed by a particular and\nfamiliar understanding of the nature of moral demands. Morality, it\nseems to many people, requires us to be impartial between persons, not\ngiving special consideration to anyone merely on the basis of\nirrelevant features. Deviations from such impartiality often appear\nmorally odious, as the world\u2019s history of racism, sexism,\nreligious bigotry, homophobia, etc. demonstrate all too clearly. But\nspecial obligations are a deviation from impartiality, as they offer\nsupport to our being partial to those persons who stand in special\nrelationships to us. A defense of special obligations, then, requires\na defense of morality as involving both partial and impartial demands\n(see Cottingham). Instead of deviating from an impartial conception of\nmorality, some philosophers have instead claimed that special\nrelationships such as friendship generate their own, non-moral reasons\nof partiality (Cocking and Kennett), while others have followed Samuel\nScheffler (1994) in claiming that we have permissions or\nagent-centered prerogatives that allow us to deviate from impartial\nmoral demands in certain contexts. And, of course, another option is\nto deny that we are justified in acting partially even in contexts in\nwhich such partiality is generally accepted. (See, for example,\nGomberg, for a defense of the claim that partiality to compatriots is\nno more justified than is racism.)\n4. Special Obligations and Voluntarism\n\nNow we can consider how the consequentialist, or anyone who claims\nthat special obligations are not genuinely special but only\nderivatively so, can turn the burden of proof back upon the defender\nof special obligations. The following discussion borrows from Samuel\nScheffler\u2019s (1994) exposition of what he calls the voluntarist\nand the distributive objections to any claim that persons have\nnon-derivative special obligations. First, the voluntarist objection\narises when we consider the perspective of the person supposed to have\nspecial obligations over and above natural duties. Why suppose that I\nacquire additional moral obligations simply by, for example, being a\nmember of some group or standing in some relationship to another? Why\nsuppose that I am obliged to sacrifice more for another person simply\nbecause that person is my intimate or colleague or fellow citizen?\n\nUnlike natural duties, special obligations are grounded on something\nother than (or, in addition to) the intrinsic nature of the obligee.\nThe voluntarist worries support the view that special obligations can\nonly be acquired through the voluntary actions of the agent whose\nobligations they\n are.[3]\n (It is important to recognize that voluntarism is a thesis about\nspecial obligations alone. The question being pressed by the\nvoluntarist concerns obligations over and above those owed to all\npersons in virtue of their intrinsic nature or those that we have to\npromote intrinsically valuable states of affairs.) Thus, the\nvoluntarist will grant that special obligations are acquired through\npromises and contracts, because, in making a promise or contract, the\nagent voluntarily agrees to bear a certain burden for the person to\nwhom she makes the promise or contract. But other sorts of purported\nspecial obligations, in particular those owed to family members or to\nfellow citizens, would not be acquired through the voluntary actions\nof the obligor: one does not choose to be born into a certain family\nor as a citizen of a given country, so why suppose that, simply as a\nresult of luck, either good or bad, I have obligations, over and above\nmy natural duties or my consequentialist duties, to my family members\nand to my fellow citizens?\n\nThose who accept the voluntarist thesis concerning special obligations\ntake one of several approaches, including the following: (i) they\nlimit special obligations to the straightforwardly contractual or\npromissory, (ii) they attempt to show that all of the special\nobligations that they defend really are contractual or promissory in\nnature, or (iii) they show that while not all special obligations are\ncontractual, they nevertheless are similar in a relevant respect.\n\nLet us begin with option (i). According to this option, in addition to\nwhatever natural duties we have, we have only those further\nobligations that we have acquired through explicit promises or\ncontracts. The difficulty with this option is that it does little to\naccommodate the range of special obligations acknowledged by\ncommonsense morality. For example, most of us do not make the sorts of\npromises that we make to spouses to all of our friends. I have never\nexplicitly promised my best friend to love and care for her. This\ndifficulty is even more apparent in the case of familial\nrelationships. We do not enter into contracts with our parents of the\nform: take care of me as a child and I will reciprocate when you are\nolder and need care. Nonetheless, it does seem that parents and\nchildren owe one another a special degree of concern and commitment.\nIf the defender of special obligations is attempting to accommodate\ncommonsense morality, then she will have done so to a very limited\nextent if she allows only those special obligations that are acquired\nthrough explicit contracts or promises.\n\nSo consider (ii), i.e., claiming that while some special obligations\nmay initially appear to be non-contractual in nature, they are really\ncontractual. We can see, for example, Locke\u2019s famous appeal to\nthe notion of tacit consent in the political context as an instance of\nthis second strategy. In the Second Treatise of Government,\nLocke claims that we have special political obligations, i.e.,\nobligations to our own government that we do not have to all\ngovernments. He himself, however, imagines someone responding, when he\nproposes that these special political obligations are contractual in\nnature, \u201c[t]hat all men being born under government, some or\nother, it is impossible any of them should ever be free, and at\nliberty to unite together, and begin a new one, or ever be able to\nerect a lawful government\u201d (61). In other words, given our\nsituations as being born into particular governments, it certainly\ndoesn\u2019t appear that our special obligations to our governments\nare contractual in nature. Thus, if we accept voluntarism (as Locke\nclearly did), then it seems that we cannot have special political\nobligations.\n\nLocke famously appeals to the notion of tacit consent in\norder to accommodate special political obligations given his\nvoluntarist commitment: \u201cevery man, that hath any possessions,\nor enjoyment, of any part of the dominions of any government, doth\nthereby give his tacit consent, and is as far forth\nobliged to obedience to the laws of that government, during such\nenjoyment, as any one under it\u201d (64). A person gives tacit or\nimplicit, as opposed to express or explicit, consent, when her consent\nis expressed via refraining from some action or type of action. As A.\nJohn Simmons (1979) has argued, either refraining from or performing\nsome action can only be taken as indicative of consent when certain\nconditions are met: the person must be aware that she is in a\nsituation in which consent is appropriate and/or expected, it must be\nmade clear in some way what must be done or not done in order to give\nconsent, it must be clear when action is to be taken or avoided, and\nthe consent-giving action or failure to act must be possible and not\nextraordinarily costly. It has been argued that the political context,\nat least as it is in the modern nation-state, fails to meet any of the\nabove conditions, and so it is implausible, if one accepts voluntarism\nand the claim that all voluntarily assumed obligations are contractual\nin nature, to suppose that persons in modern nation-states have\nspecial political obligations.\n\nWhile appeal to tacit consent is most familiar in the context of\nattempting to ground special political obligations, one could also use\nthis notion in order to ground, for example, special obligations to\nfriends. Again, however, one would have to show that friendship is a\ncontext that meets the conditions as described by Simmons, and it\nseems implausible to suppose that it is. Further, however, some would\nhave a further objection to construing obligations of friendship as\ncontractual: such a model seems to misconstrue the nature of\nfriendship as involving, as Aristotle claimed, concern for the other\nfor the other\u2019s own sake. Whether or not one can accommodate\nobligations of friendship (or obligations of parents to care for their\nchildren) as grounded on tacit consent, it seems quite clear that, for\nexample, familial obligations, such as those of children to parents,\ndo not involve anything like a promise or contract, either express or\ntacit. Again, as with option (i), option (ii) does not go far toward\naccommodating the range of special obligations recognized by\ncommonsense morality.\n\nThe third strategy available to a voluntarist defender of special\nobligations is to argue that while it is not the case that all special\nobligations are reducible to contractual obligations, nonetheless, all\nspecial obligations share the feature of voluntary assumption with\ncontractual obligations. All special obligations, according to this\naccount, are forms of voluntary commitments undertaken by the\nindividual moral agent. While not all actions that constitute the\nundertaking of a commitment mimic those involved in the making of a\npromise or contract, they are all such that the agent can choose\nwhether or not to perform them. Also, while promises and contracts are\ntemporally discrete events, a commitment may be undertaken via a\ntemporally extended series of events, each of which, in and of itself,\nhas no moral significance: it is only the series taken as a whole that\ngenerates or grounds special obligations. While this strategy has the\nvirtue of being able to accommodate obligations of friendship without\ndistorting the nature of friendship, it, like the previous voluntarist\noptions, holds out little hope of accommodating political or familial\nspecial obligations. At this point, the voluntarist is faced with a\nchoice: either reject her initial commitment to voluntarism regarding\nspecial obligations or reject the commonsense claim about the\nextensive range of special obligations that we have.\n\nSome have been dissatisfied with the seeming limitations placed on the\nextent of our special obligations by the voluntarist thesis. (Again,\nonly voluntarism with respect to special obligations is under\ndiscussion here. Voluntarism with respect to all of our duties would\nseriously delimit our moral responsibilities, and so, for that reason,\nis held by virtually no one.) Common sense morality, after all, seems\nto endorse a host of obligations derived from persons\u2019s roles or\npositions, even when these roles or positions are not occupied as the\nresult of any voluntary choice on the part of the moral agent. Each of\nus occupies various roles; for example, I am my mother\u2019s\ndaughter, my brother\u2019s sister, a university professor, a U.S.\ncitizen, a resident of Iowa, etc. Some people occupy positions in\nreligious communities as, e.g., Jews or Catholics or Hindus, some are\nmembers of armed forces, some belong to clubs, sports teams, etc. Our\nunderstandings of what it is to occupy a certain role often involves\ncertain normative assumptions about the person\u2019s obligations in\nvirtue of occupying that role. So, for example, in virtue of being an\nOrthodox Jew, Joe Schmoe is obligated not to eat pork, in virtue of\nbeing a philosophy professor, I am obligated to provide assistance to\nmy students, and in virtue of being my mother\u2019s daughter, I am\nobligated to care for her when she is elderly. So role obligations,\ni.e., obligations that we have in virtue of occupying some role\n(whether or not voluntarily assumed), appear to be special\nobligations: they are usually owed to some limited class of persons\nand one acquires them through some actions of one\u2019s own or in\nvirtue of one\u2019s status, not as a result of intrinsic features of\nthe obligee or of the state of affairs to be promoted.\n\nBut, of course, we always need to distinguish between moral and\nnon-moral (or reason-giving and non-reason-giving) obligations of role\n(or position). It is true that our very understanding of certain roles\nseems to involve the having of certain obligations, duties, or\nresponsibilities. To be a daughter, for example, involves certain\ncare-taking responsibilities toward parents, just as being a professor\nof philosophy involves obligations to students, colleagues, and the\nprofession more generally. But, analogously, being the commandant of a\nconcentration camp in Nazi Germany seemed to involve certain\nobligations of role, including using slave labor as productively as\npossible and killing as many Jews as possible on a daily basis. Also,\nOrthodox Jewish women have certain role obligations to be submissive\nto their husbands and to refrain from certain forms of work, study,\nand participation in religious observance. However, the sense in which\na commandant of a camp has obligations of role does not seem to be a\nmoral or reason-giving sense, and it is at least an open question as\nto whether Orthodox Jewish women have obligations to be submissive to\nthe male members of their community. Such language of obligations of\nroles seems to involve merely others\u2019 expectations of persons\nholding such positions. Why, a voluntarist (or anyone else, for that\nmatter) will ask, should we suppose that such expectations are\nsufficient for the having of obligations in the reason-giving or moral\nsense?\n\nAnti-voluntarists have taken at least five different routes to\nresponding to this voluntarist worry about the normative status of\nobligations of role or position (the names used here are not\nnecessarily used by those who take one or the other of these options):\n(i) the \u2018true community\u2019 view, (ii) the \u2018reflective\nacceptance\u2019 view, (iii) the \u2018justice view\u2019, (iv) the\nappeal to value, and (v) the \u2018constitutive commitment\u2019\nview. In assessing these various options, we need to keep in mind the\nrange of roles that people can occupy, ranging from being the parent\nof or being a university professor to being the commandant of a\nconcentration camp or the member of a terrorist organization. If roles\nor positions generate moral or reason-giving obligations, we need some\nconception of roles that does not yield the implausible implication\nthat Nazis had moral obligations to herd Jews into gas chambers.\nFurther, we need some conception of a role or position that does not\nreduce all obligations to obligations of role or position. If natural\nduties are not to be rendered obligations of role or position, we need\nto be told why being a moral agent is not a role, but being an\nAmerican is. In other words, what descriptions of a person constitute\nstatements of that person\u2019s obligation-generating roles and\nwhich do not? Why is the fact that I am my mother\u2019s daughter\nconstitutive of a role that I occupy whereas being a human being or\nbeing a person born in the latter half of May on the cusp of Taurus\nand Gemini is not?\n\nLet us begin with (i) as advocated by Ronald Dworkin. Dworkin uses the\nterm \u2018associative [or, communal] obligations\u2019 to refer to\nwhat have been called obligations of role. By \u2018associative\nobligations\u2019 Dworkin means \u201cthe special responsibilities\nsocial practice attaches to membership in some biological or social\ngroup, like the responsibilities of family or friends or\nneighbors\u201d (196). Because his understanding of these obligations\nis not such as to require \u2018choice or consent,\u2019 Dworkin\nthinks that we can construe special political obligations as\nassociative obligations.\n\nHowever, according to Dworkin, only in a true community do members\nhave associative obligations toward one another. Whereas a bare\ncommunity is one that \u201cmeets the genetic or geographical or\nother historical conditions identified by social practice as capable\nof constituting a fraternal community,\u201d the members of a true\ncommunity meet the following four conditions (201):\n\nFirst, they must regard the group\u2019s obligations as\nspecial, holding distinctly within the group, rather than as\ngeneral duties its members owe equally to persons outside it. Second,\nthey must accept that these responsibilities are personal:\nthat they run directly from each member to each other member, not just\nto the group as a whole in some collective sense. \u2026 Third,\nmembers must see these responsibilities as flowing from a more general\nresponsibility each has of concern for the well-being of\nothers in the group \u2026 Fourth, members must suppose that the\ngroup\u2019s practices show not only concern but an equal\nconcern for all members. (199\u2013200)\n\n\nThus, on Dworkin\u2019s account, mere social expectation is not\nsufficient to create associative obligations: persons must meet\ncertain psychological requirements in order for their group, be it a\nfriendship, a family, or a nation-state, to be the sort of community\nsuch that membership in that community, independent of choice or\nconsent, grounds associative obligations.\n\nReturning to the issues raised about role positions, we can notice\nthat a community could satisfy Dworkin\u2019s requirements for being\na true community and yet be such that we might not want to regard its\nmembers as having special moral obligations to one another. Consider a\nwhite supremacist organization: it might very well meet all of the\ncriteria that Dworkin lays out as both necessary and sufficient for a\ncommunity\u2019s being a true community. But is it really the case\nthat members of white supremacist organizations have special moral\nobligations in virtue of being a member of, e.g., Aryan Nation? One\nresponse is that in fact they do have prima facie special obligations\nof role to one another, but that, given the hideous nature of the aims\nof Aryan Nation, those obligations are never their\nall-things-considered duties, i.e., their obligations of role are\nalways outweighed by their natural duties or duties of justice. But\nthe question then remains: why do white supremacists have special,\nadditional moral obligations toward one another simply in virtue of\ntheir having a joint commitment to the immoral treatment of blacks and\nJews?\n\nSo let us consider approach (ii), the reflective acceptance view, as\nadvocated by Michael Hardimon in his \u201cRole Obligations.\u201d\nHardimon aims to offer an account of obligations attached to certain\ninstitutionally defined roles, namely \u201cpolitical, familial, and\noccupational roles\u201d (334), where a role is a\n\u201c[constellation] of institutionally specified rights and duties\norganized around an institutionally specified social function\u201d\n(334). A role obligation, according to Hardimon, is \u201ca moral\nrequirement, which attaches to an institutional role, whose content is\nfixed by the function of the role, and whose normative force flows\nfrom the role\u201d (334). Some role obligations attach to unchosen\nsocial roles, but only to social roles that are reflectively\nacceptable:\n\nTo say that a social role is reflectively acceptable is to\nsay that one would accept it upon reflection. Determining whether a\ngiven social role is reflectively acceptable involves stepping back\nfrom that role in thought and asking whether it is a role people ought\nto occupy and play. Determining that a given social role is\nreflectively acceptable involves judging that it is (in some sense)\nmeaningful, rational, or good. (348)\n\n\nThus, on Hardimon\u2019s account, it is hypothetical rather than\nactual consent that grounds unchosen special obligations. (Some have\ninterpreted Locke as in fact appealing to hypothetical rather than to\nactual consent. It is important to see that hypothetical consent is\nnot really consent, and so a view such as Hardimon\u2019s is not a\nvoluntarist view, as Hardimon himself readily acknowledges.)\n\nThe obvious question for Hardimon\u2019s view is why we need to\nappeal to the notion of reflective acceptance at all. It seems that\nwhat Hardimon is really appealing to as a necessary condition of a\nrole\u2019s generating obligations is that\u2019s role being\n\u2018meaningful, rational, or good\u2019. As we saw, a difficulty\nwith (i), the true community view, is that it leaves open the\npossibility that occupying a role in an unjust community still\ngenerates obligations. Hardimon is clearly worried about this issue\nand so makes appeal to what one would judge good or just if one were\nto make such a judgment (and, let\u2019s assume, judge correctly).\nBut then the hypothetical judgment is really epiphenomenal with\nrespect to the justification and we are left with (iii), the justice\nview: one has obligations in virtue of occupying a role if and only if\none\u2019s filling that role and the institution in which one would\nbe filling that role meet certain conditions of morality or\njustice.\n\nIs this justice or morality condition, however, sufficient? Suppose\nthat all of my neighbors organize the \u201cWest Side Reading\nGroup,\u201d which will meet once a month at the local coffee house\nto discuss edifying books, articles, etc. Members of the group are\nobligated to attend a certain number of meetings a year, participate\nin discussions, and recommend books or articles to other members of\nthe group. Everyone who lives in a certain sector of the west side of\ntown is a member of the group. Given that I live in that part of the\nwest side of town, I am thereby a member of the group. Do I have\nobligations to attend meetings, etc.? The group appears to be just and\nto have good ends. Given that I am well-read, it would be good if I\nwere to contribute to the group, and my participating would certainly\nnot be unjust or immoral. But why suppose that I have special\nobligations to other members of the reading group simply because those\nothers have decided to describe me in a certain way, even if their\ngroup is a good group with just and worthy goals in which I could\nparticipate without violating any requirements of justice or\nmorality?\n\nA similar difficulty plagues (iv), the appeal to value, as defended by\nSamuel Scheffler in his \u201cRelationships and\nResponsibilities.\u201d Scheffler argues that relationships give rise\nto special obligations only when persons have reason to value the\nrelationships. Scheffler\u2019s argument has the following form:\n\n(1) We have good reason to value (noninstrumentally) certain\nrelationships with other persons.\n\n\n(2) To value (noninstrumentally) relationships with others is, in\npart, to see those relationships as a source of reasons, that is, as a\nsource of special obligations.\n\n(3) Therefore, we have good reason to see ourselves as having special\nobligations.\n\n\nScheffler\u2019s claim is that the very act of valuing certain types\nof relationships involves seeing ourselves as having special\nobligations. If we have reason to value the relationship, then we have\nreason to understand ourselves as having special obligations,\nregardless of whether we have chosen to enter or to maintain the\nrelationship. The plausibility of Scheffler\u2019s view depends, to a\nlarge extent, upon what counts as a relationship in this context. Do I\nstand in the relevant sort of relationship to other members of the\nWest Side Reading Group? As stated above, it seems that I have reason\nto value being a member of the group in so far as my being in the\ngroup would promote my well-being and the well-being of the other\nmembers. So, according to Scheffler, I have reason to see myself as\nhaving special obligations to other members of the group. But it\nhardly seems that I am not fulfilling obligations when I fail to go to\nmeetings.\n\nThe final view that I will consider, Michael Sandel\u2019s\nantivoluntarism, is motivated by dissatisfaction with Western liberal\npolitical theory as exemplified by, for example, Locke and John Rawls.\nSandel claims that adherence to voluntarism is inconsistent with the\nnature of the person. Sandel advocates (v), the claim that certain\nroles that we find ourselves in, understood as involving special\nobligations, are \u2018constitutive commitments.\u2019 The person is\nnot free to make all of her own commitments, because the self cannot\nbe understood separately from certain commitments, such as those\narising from family or political community. Sandel is objecting to\nwhat he takes to be the standard, liberal picture of the self: free to\nchoose her own ends and only having those special obligations that\nresult from her voluntary choices.\n\nThe plausibility of Sandel\u2019s version of anti-voluntarism\ndepends, of course, upon the plausibility of the claim that persons\nare partially constituted by their relationships to other persons or\ngroups of persons. In order to assess the plausibility of that claim,\nwe need to disambiguate two possible readings of it, a causal reading\nand a metaphysical reading. The first, causal reading of the claim is\nobviously true: persons are the sort of persons that they are as a\nresult of their causal interactions with other persons and groups of\npersons. Nobody would deny this causal reading of Sandel\u2019s\nclaim, but it is not at all clear how it would support any normative\nconclusions. After all, other persons can have negative as well as\npositive effects on my character and personality. Why suppose that I\nhave special obligations as a result of interactions over which I\nmight have no control?\n\nThe second, metaphysical reading of Sandel\u2019s claim needs more\ndefense. According to Sandel, certain of my relationships to other\npersons are partly constitutive of the person that I am. According to\nthe metaphysical reading of that claim, I would not be the same person\nthat I now am if, for example, I had not been born in the U.S. In\nother words, I am necessarily an American. At best, such a claim is\ncontroversial, at worst, obviously false. After all, I certainly seem\nto be able to conceive of myself as having been born in France, having\nbeen born an Orthodox Jew, or being born an only child instead of\nhaving a brother as I do. So before we can even ask whether a\n\u2018constitutive commitment\u2019 would have normative\nimplications, we need to be told quite a bit more as to why we should\nview ourselves as being partly constituted by the relationships in\nwhich we happen to stand to other people. On either reading of\nSandel\u2019s claim, the constitutive commitments view faces all of\nthe difficulties inherent in any form of relativism: if I am born in a\nsexist culture, for example, why suppose that I thereby have\nobligations to obey the men in my life? A view such as Sandel\u2019s\nseems to make it the case that I am morally obligated as a result of\nthe social structures into which I am born, no matter how morally\nrepugnant those social structures might be. It is this sort of worry\nthat gives even greater credence to the voluntarist thesis with\nrespect to special obligations.\n5. Special Obligations and the Distributive Objection\n\nFinally, let us return to the second of the objections to special\nobligations, what Scheffler calls \u2018the distributive\nobjection.\u2019 Special obligations are owed to those that we can\nthink of as \u2018insiders\u2019: those to whom promises have been\nmade, members of a given family, citizens of a certain nation, etc. If\nI owe more to my intimates, then, it seems, I am justified in doing\nmore for them than for other persons, even if the latter are more\nneedy than my intimates. This sort of worry is, of course, in part\nwhat motivates a consequentialist theory: no person\u2019s well-being\nis more valuable than that of any other person, and so we are\nunjustified in failing to be impartial between intimates and\nstrangers. Whereas there may be good consequentialist reasons for\nacting as though we have special obligations, as we have seen, the\nconsequentialist (and any other defender of the distributive\nobjection) will insist that a commitment to genuinely special\nobligations gives weight to morally insignificant contingent features\nof persons.\n\nThe distributive objection is troubling: it forces us to find some\njustification for that feature of common sense morality that C. D.\nBroad called \u2018self-referential altruism,\u2019 the view that\neach of us has special obligations to her family,\nher friends, her fellow citizens, etc. Defenders of\nspecial obligations need to show why our pre-theoretical commitment to\nsuch obligations is more than merely a reflection of our constitution\nas, in Hume\u2019s terms, \u2018limited altruists.\u2019 Advocates\nof evolutionary ethics will suggest that, given that we can offer a\nstory about why beliefs to the effect that we owe more to certain\npersons than to others have survival advantage, we have reason to\ndiscount the claim that we have genuine special obligations. It has\nbeen claimed that we are hard-wired to promote the continuance of our\ngenetic inheritance. Doing what we need to do to protect genetically\nrelated persons (and others willing to protect such persons), then, is\nevolutionarily advantageous. Thus, acting as though and believing that\nwe have special obligations (at least to friends and family members)\nis advantageous.\n\nOf course, there are difficulties with appeal to an evolutionary\naccount of the source of our beliefs about our obligations. All that\nsuch an appeal does is to propose a causal hypothesis about the\ngenesis of our beliefs. Even if that causal hypothesis is true, it\ndoes not show that the belief that we have special obligations is\nfalse. People often acquire true beliefs as a result of mechanisms\nthat do not provide any evidence or justification for the belief. For\nall that we know, our acceptance of modus ponens as an inferential\nrule might be due to the selective advantage accruing to those who use\nthat rule, but, I take it, few would see that as undermining the\nvalidity of that rule of inference.\n\nLeaving aside any such evolutionary considerations, however, still\nleaves us with the fact that the intuitive pull of special obligations\ncompetes with the intuitive pull of the consequentialist stance. In\norder to avoid the latter and to respond to charges of parochialism,\nthe defender of special obligations needs to deal with the\ndistributive objection.\n\nOne potential response is to insist that upon acquiring special\nobligations, a moral agent does not owe less to other persons, but,\nrather, simply owes more to her intimates. Thus, in addition to our\nduty of benevolence, we have, as Ross claimed, special obligations to\nthose who \u201cstand to me in the relation of promisee to promiser,\nof creditor to debtor, of wife to husband, of child to parent, of\nfriend to friend, of fellow countryman to fellow countryman, and the\nlike\u201d (19). The more such relationships that I stand in, the\nmore obligations I acquire. Unless my duty of benevolence is a\nmaximizing duty, there is no reason to suppose that I cannot balance\nthat duty with my special obligations. Of course, even if my\nobligations to \u2018outsiders\u2019 have not decreased, it is still\ntrue that \u2018insiders\u2019 will be benefitted more than\n\u2018outsiders,\u2019 and that might still be worrisome. However,\ngiven that \u2018insiders\u2019 also have to bear the cost of\nbenefitting other \u2018insiders,\u2019 the relative balance of\ncosts and benefits might remain the same for insiders and outsiders.\nBut, the defender of special obligations might say, as long as I\nbenefit everyone to the extent to which I owe them benefits, why is\nthe relative balance of costs and benefits relevant? Only on the most\nradical of egalitarian views is the equalizing of that balance\nconsidered an end in itself of morality.\n\nIn any case, this reply to the distributive objection depends upon the\nclaim that we can balance our special obligations against our natural\nor consequentialist duties. According to most defenders of special\nobligations, such obligations are prima facie obligations, i.e., they\nare obligations with a certain weight that can be counterbalanced by\nthe weight of other special obligations or of other types of\nobligations. In order to figure out what our all-things-considered\nduty is, we need to weigh all of our reasons for action and decide\nwhich is the strongest or weightiest in the circumstances. One\nadvantage of a theory such as consequentialism is that, given that it\nregards all of our obligations or duties as derivative from one\nfundamental duty (the duty to maximize value), we do not need to try\nto determine which of our duties is strongest in any given instance.\nOnce we allow non-derivative, genuinely special obligations in our\nmoral theory, we are left with the question as to whether we can ever\nknow when a special obligation outweighs another special obligation or\na natural duty. Moral philosophers such as Ross give us no answer to\nthis question, and it is plausible to suppose that there is no general\nrule that we can use for weighing duties against one another. Perhaps\nthe best answer is that, once we know what our obligations are, it is\nself-evident as to which is the strongest, always remembering that\n\u2018self-evident\u2019 does not mean \u2018obvious,\u2019 but,\nrather, \u2018can be known or justifiably believed without any\nprocess of reasoning or inference.\u2019 At this point, we are\ninvolved in controversies in moral epistemology that are beyond the\nscope of this piece.\n6. The Range and Types of Special Obligations\n\nWhen and if we are able to defend the claim that we have fundamental\nagent-relative special obligations, we need to determine which special\nobligations we have. The political community, friendship, and\npromising/contracting have already been discussed as arenas in which\nspecial obligations may or may not arise. All of these areas of the\nmoral life have received extensive attention in the philosophical\nliterature. But there are two important contexts that have received\nless attention, but, for various reasons, are becoming more pressing\nfor moral agents in our society today. Hopefully, philosophers will\nbegin to pay these contexts the attention they urgently need.\n6.1 Filial Duty\n\nMedical advances are making it possible for people to live longer and\nlonger lives. Thus, our society has an ever increasing percentage of\nelderly persons in need of medical and other forms of care. Many of us\nbear very special ties to some of those persons: they are our parents,\nthe people who raised and nurtured us in our formative childhoods and\nyoung adulthoods. Now that our positions are reversed \u2014 we,\ntheir children, are self-sufficient and capable, and they, our\nparents, are in need of care and supervision \u2014 what do we owe to\nthem? Given the needs of elderly persons, caring for them may be\nextremely burdensome, and may require adult children to completely\nalter their lives, thereby making great sacrifices. Do adult children\nhave special obligations to their aging parents, and, if so, why?\n\nSimon Keller offers a thoughtful discussion of these issues in his\n\u201cFour Theories of Filial Duty.\u201d Keller rejects three\naccounts of such duties: the debt account, the gratitude account, and\nthe friendship account. He offers instead what he calls the\n\u201cspecial goods\u201d account: parents and children provide each\nother with very special goods, goods that cannot be gotten from any\nother type of relationship. No matter how true this is, Keller needs\nto explain why the fact that I can provide certain goods for my aging\nparents that nobody else can provide makes it the case that I have\nspecial obligations to my parents \u2014 after all, the\nconsequentialist seems to be able to accommodate my reasons to care\nfor my parents if my reason is grounded on the provision of benefits.\nSo one possible objection to Keller\u2019s account is that it is in\nserious danger of collapsing into consequentialism, i.e., of making\nour obligations to our parents only derivatively agent-relative.\n\nKeller also needs to give more serious consideration to the friendship\naccount of special obligations to parents. He claims that duties to\nparents are different from duties to friends because the former are\nmuch weightier than the latter and that our duties to our parents are\nnot within our discretion to the same extent as our duties to friends\n(263\u2013264). Keller\u2019s critique only works to the extent that\nhe is right about the nature of our duties to our friends. It might be\nargued that genuine friendship is not so easily disposed of as Keller\nmakes it, and many of us expect more of our friends than he seems to\nthink that friends should legitimately expect of one another. The\nimportant thing to see here, though, is how important an account of\nvarious relationships is to an understanding of the obligations that\nthose relationships generate. (See Jeske, 2008a.)\n6.2 Parental Obligations\n\nIn our society the least questioned of all apparent special\nobligations is that of a parent to his or her children. We seem to\nreserve our harshest moral condemnations for those who fail to see to\nthe best interests of their children. We also seem to see the special\nobligations of parents to their children as requiring great\nself-sacrifice, perhaps more than is demanded by any other special\nrelationship. But what explains these highly stringent\nobligations?\n\nDavid Archard makes the important distinction between having \u201can\nobligation to ensure that someone acts as a parent to the child\u201d\nand having an obligation to act as a parent oneself. He calls the\nformer \u2018parental obligations,\u2019 and the latter are dubbed\n\u2018parental responsibilities\u2019 (104\u2013105). Archard\ndefends a causal theory of parental obligations, according to which\n\u201cthose who cause children to exist thereby incur an obligation\nthat they are adequately cared for\u201d (127). Thus, a parent could,\naccording to Archard, fulfill her parental obligations that result\nfrom conceiving and bearing a child, by finding adoptive parents who\nwill assume parental responsibilities for the child. As Archard\nacknowledges, anyone offering a causal account owes us a view about\nwhat role one needs to play in the causal generation of a child in\norder to have parental obligations: if I rent an apartment to a couple\nthat makes it possible for them to have the privacy to pursue the\ncreation of a family, I play a causal role in bringing their child\ninto existence, but surely I do not have parental obligations of any\nkind.\n\nOn the other side of the debate is the voluntarist account of parental\nobligations, according to which one comes to have parental obligations\nonly by voluntarily accepting such obligations (see Brake for a\ndefense of this view, and Prusak for critique of Brake). Of course,\nany such view owes us an account of what would count as voluntary\nassumption of parental obligations. Certain accounts of what counts as\nvoluntary assumption \u2013 i.e., ones that count engaging in\nprocreative sexual activity as voluntary assumption of parental\nobligations \u2013 could cause the voluntarist view to collapse back\ninto the causal account. Clearly, getting the appropriate account of\ncausation \u2013 if we accept the causal view \u2013 and of\nvoluntary assumption \u2013 if we accept the voluntarist view \u2013\nis important if we are to apply these views to issues such as\nabortion, child support, surrogate motherhood, and new reproductive\ntechnologies.\n6.3 Professional Obligations\n\nMany of us assume obligations when we assume professional roles. As a\nphilosophy professor at a state university, I have obligations to my\ncolleagues, my students, and the taxpayers of the state of Iowa.\nPhysicians and therapists have obligations to their patients, police\nofficers to the citizens of their jurisdictions, ministers and priests\nto their flocks, etc. Are these obligations mere obligations of role\nwithout moral implications, or are they genuinely moral special\nobligations? These questions are particularly pressing, given how\noften our professions can force us to make morally charged decisions:\nany study of history shows how dangerous it can be for people to bow\nunreflectively to what they take to be the duties of their roles. As\nJoel Feinberg points out, conflicts between perceived special\nobligations of position and more general duties created great tension\nand conflict for American abolitionist judges prior to the Civil War.\nIn an era of increased concern about professional ethics, we need to\nhave some account of which professional roles, if any, generate\ngenuinely moral special duties. (See Almond.)\n 6.4 Compatriots \n\nOne type of voluntarist account of special obligations has become\nfamiliar from the political context: Locke\u2019s consent theory of\npolitical obligations. (See section 4.) Many people seem to understand\nthemselves as having special obligations to their fellow citizens, and\nvarious accounts of these obligations have been offered. (See the\nentries on\n political obligation,\n and\n cosmopolitanism.)\n\nIn recent years, more and more attention is being paid to issues of\nglobal justice, and, inevitably, discussion has turned to the conflict\n(or, at least, the apparent conflict) between our duties to our\ncompatriots and our duties to others around the globe, in particular,\nthe global poor. In this literature, the debate is described as being\nbetween those who accept associationism and those who accept\ncosmopolitanism. The former accept that we have associative duties\n\u2013 \u201cduties we owe to people with whom we are associated in\nsome way,\u201d including compatriots (Seglow 54) \u2013 while the\nlatter \u201cregard people\u2019s local allegiance as a parochial\nobstacle that stands in the way of achieving global distributive\njustice\u201d (55). Seglow aims to defend the former, associationist\nposition, while others, such as Caney, defend the latter (even while\nattempting to give at least an instrumental role to associations). Yet\nothers (Moellendorf) try to extend the notion of association in such a\nway that the global economy, for example, grounds associational duties\n(see Lenard and Moore for discussion of such views).\n\nThis debate is clearly closely related to Scheffler\u2019s discussion\nof the distributive objection discussed above. How can we justify\npartiality to our perhaps already comparatively well-off compatriots\nwhen many people around the globe do not have the basic necessities?\n\n\nThese are only some of the types of special obligations that have been\ndefended by philosophers. Here is just a sample of the range of\nspecial obligations defended in the philosophical literature: members\nof society to help families and children of those incarcerated\n(Bulow), beneficiaries of injustice to aid those who are victims of\ninjustice (Butt), pharmaceutical companies to provide lifesaving\nmedication to those in need (Huebner), and those who become aware of\nanother\u2019s need via a waver of privacy to aid that other\n(Richardson). Philosophers who defend special obligations of any type\nneed to carefully consider whether that defense can also be used with\nrespect to other special obligations and also whether such extension\nis plausible. If not, the special obligation originally defended\nshould be reconsidered. After all, if special relationships generate\nor ground special obligations, we need to be careful not to render any\nand every relationship \u2019special,\u2019 or that term will lose\nits significance. For any proposed special obligation, we need to\nconsider whether it is more plausibly understood as derivative from an\nagent-neutral reason or a natural duty and so not really special in a\nfundamental sense.\n7. The Grounds of Special Obligations\n\nSo far we have examined some contrasts between special obligations and\nboth consequentialist duties and natural duties, and have also\ndiscussed two objections to special obligations, the voluntarist\nobjection and the distributive objection. In discussing responses to\nthe voluntarist objection, some accounts of the grounds of special\nobligations were considered. But there are some other important\naccounts that deserve mention. Given the number of types of special\nobligations that commonsense recognizes, presenting the various\naccounts that have been offered of their grounds would be a\nbook-length task. So the following discussion of the grounds of\nspecial obligations should not be taken as in any way exhaustive.\n\nAs indicated above, voluntarists have often tried to assimilate all\nspecial obligations to promissory or contractual obligations. Even if\nsuch an assimilation were to be successful, we would still need an\naccount of the basis of promissory obligations. Some have attempted to\nground obligations to keep promises on the fact that when one makes a\npromise, one raises expectations in the one to whom the promise has\nbeen made. The promisee, then, has a right to have her expectations\nmet, given the promisor\u2019s voluntary raising of her expectations.\nIf you voluntarily lead me to expect that you will perform a given\naction, then I am likely to make plans on the basis of that\nexpectation. You are obligated not to upset the plans that I have made\non the basis of your voluntary actions that you knew would raise my\nexpectations. This account of the basis of promissory obligations has\nbeen extended into other contexts, including those of friendship and\nthe family (see especially Hoff Sommers\u2019 account of filial\nobligations). Our friends and family members come to rely upon us to\nact in certain ways with respect to them, and their reliance is due to\nour own voluntary past actions. Thus, as with our promisees, our\nfriends and family members have a right not to be disappointed in\ntheir expectations, a right correlated with a duty on our part to meet\ntheir expectations.\n\nOne serious difficulty with this sort of grounding of special\nobligations is that it appeals to the psychological states of those to\nwhom the obligations are owed. But consider a case in which the person\nto whom a promise is made does not expect the one making the promise\nto comply (Scanlon calls this the case of the Profligate Pal). If such\nexpectations are not raised, are no obligations created? Parents often\nhave little expectation that their children will care for them when\nthey are elderly, but that does not seem sufficient to defeat the\nclaim that children do in fact have special obligations to care for\ntheir parents. The defender of the expectations account could try\nappealing to legitimate even if only hypothetical expectations at this\npoint, but we are still left wondering why I ought to meet\nexpectations that have never actually been raised.\n\nWith respect to friendship, some have defended what can be called an\n\u2018Aristotelian\u2019 account of special obligations. Jennifer\nWhiting, for example, argues that we ought to take special care of our\nfriends if they are worthy of such concern. Thus, if I have a virtuous\nfriend, I am required to care for her because her character renders\nher deserving and a suitable object of such concern. The obvious worry\nabout any such Aristotelian account is its distance from commonsense.\nAccording to the Aristotelian account, I have special obligations to\nfriends and family if they are deserving of special concern. But\ncommonsense allows that I have special obligations to friends and\nfamily members even if they are not particularly or especially\nvirtuous. It seems that I have special obligations to help my\nintimates be virtuous, even if they are not yet virtuous. The\nAristotelian view only accounts for our special obligations to those\nof our friends or loved ones who are virtuous. But what about our less\nthan virtuous intimates? The Aristotelian must either deny that we\nhave special obligations to our non-virtuous intimates or allow that\nsomething other than virtuous character grounds special obligations to\nmost of our intimates. So the Aristotelian account is either\nimplausible or radically incomplete as an account of special\nobligations.\n\nSome defenders of special obligations have tried to draw upon claims\nabout personal identity to support their views (see especially David\nBrink). If defenders of what is known as psychological reductionism\nare right, then me now is co-personal with me later as a result of the\npsychological relationship existing between me now and me later. Me\nlater bears many psychological connections (either direct or indirect)\nto me now, and those connections form a causal chain from me now to me\nlater. But these connections can also exist in the interpersonal case,\ne.g., I can share traits with my friends and this sharing of traits\nmay be due to the interaction between us. If the relation of\n\u2018identity\u2019 between me now and me later supports reasons of\nprudence, we might suppose that the similar relation in the\ninterpersonal case supports reasons of special obligation. Of course,\nthis account requires far more development. Why suppose that we do in\nfact have reasons of prudence? Why suppose that similarity of relation\ngrounds similarity of reasons? These questions need to be answered\nbefore any appeal to the metaphysics of personal identity can be used\nto ground special obligations.\n\nRichard J. Arneson raises another worry about this type of appeal to\npsychological connections to ground special obligations. As both he\nand the advocates of such accounts point out, my strongest\npsychological connections are those that I bear to myself. But if such\npsychological connections are supposed to underlie obligations to take\nspecial care of those to whom I bear such connections, then it follows\nthat my strongest special obligations are to myself, and so I am\nmorally obligated to give special weight to my own interests. Arneson\nargues that any account of \u201cspecial-ties partiality\u201d, in\norder to be acceptable, must not have the consequence that we each\nhave special obligations to be partial to ourselves. Perhaps, however,\none could meet Arneson\u2019s objection, by refusing to use the word\n\u2018obligation\u2019: we have various kinds of fundamental\nagent-relative reasons, and one of those reasons is to take special\ncare of ourselves. Couched in terms of reasons, rather than in terms\nof obligations, the latter claim does not seem at all implausible.\n\nLet\u2019s consider one last account of the grounds of special\nobligations. The difficulties with the consequentialist account of\nspecial obligations arise from its only granting instrumental\nsignificance to special relationships, i.e., special relationships\nprovide unique opportunities for promoting intrinsic value. But\ncommonsense seems to accord moral significance to special\nrelationships considered for their own sake, not in virtue of the\nopportunities that they afford. One could then argue that reasons of\nspecial obligation supervene upon relationships between friends,\nbetween promisor and promisee, etc. So there is no deeper account of\nspecial obligations: truths about reasons and the relationships upon\nwhich they supervene are self-evident. This was the intuitionist line\nadopted by W. D. Ross. Defense of this account of the grounds of\nspecial obligation requires meeting objections to an intuitionist\nmoral epistemology, which, as a version of foundationalism, is a\nfrequent target of attack in recent philosophical work.\n8. Moral Risk and Special Obligations\n\nSpecial relationships take many forms, and the parties to those\nrelationships range across the entire spectrum of moral character (at\nleast according to some views), from the extremely virtuous to the\ndownright bad, with most of us falling somewhere in the middle of that\nrange. This fact about the human beings who make promises, stand in\nfamilial relationships, and have friends, leads to the worry that\nspecial obligations, in certain circumstances, will license, and\nperhaps even require, very bad behavior.\n\nDean Cocking and Jeanette Kennett, in their \u201cFriendship and\nMoral Danger,\u201d offer a case in which one friend, Carl, calls\nupon another, Dave, to help him to hide the body of someone whom he\nhas killed (279\u2013280). What ought Dave to do in such a\ncircumstance? The worry is that if Dave has special obligations to his\nfriend Carl, then it seems that Dave ought to help Carl to hide the\nbody. But, in the absence of special obligations, it seems clear that\nDave ought to alert the police to what Carl has done. Does the\nfriendship between Dave and Carl provide them with a license or even a\nrequirement to act immorally (or, in a way such that in the absence of\nthe friendship, it would count as immoral) in order to protect one\nanother? Similarly, do Nazis have special obligations to one another\nto help each other with their genocidal plans? Do parents have\nobligations to protect their children, no matter what terrible crimes\ntheir children have committed?\n\nCocking and Kennett regard the claims or obligations of friendship as\nnon-moral claims. They use the likelihood of \u2018moral\ndanger\u2019 within friendship to undermine what they call\n\u201chighly-moralized\u201d accounts of friendship (280ff). Thus,\nfor them, the demands created by special relationships are not moral\ndemands. So, on their view, the non-moral special obligations of\nfriendship may certainly conflict with moral obligations, just as,\npresumably, reasons of self-interest or prudence may conflict with\nmoral demands. We then are left with the familiar problem of how we\nought to balance moral and non-moral reasons against one another.\n\nIn \u201cMoral Permissibility Constraints on Voluntary\nObligations,\u201d Alistair Macleod argues for the claim that there\nare moral limits on the types of voluntary actions that can give rise\nto special obligations: \u201cActions \u2026 must survive moral\nscrutiny \u2013 which means, in effect, that it must be possible to\ncharacterize them as morally permissible actions \u2013 if the duties\nthat are generated by the acts in question are to be given recognition\nas  moral duties \u201d (132; emphasis in original). Special\nmoral obligations can only arise from voluntary actions and choices\nthat are morally justifiable (135). Of course, Macleod could then take\nthe Cocking and Kennett route and still regard those voluntary actions\nwhich are not morally justified as creating reasons of some kind, or\nhe could deny that morally impermissible choices, such as, perhaps,\nbecoming friends with a Nazi, create any sort of reasons whatsoever.\nIn his discussion of \u201cReasonable Partiality Towards\nCompatriots,\u201d David Miller claims that special obligations\n\u201carise only from relationships that are intrinsically\nvaluable\u201d (65), and \u201cthe attachments that ground them\n[cannot] inherently involve injustice\u201d (66). So membership in\nthe Nazi party will not generate special obligations, because that\ngroup does \u201cinherently involve injustice.\u201d\n\nWhat is important is not whether we decide to call the demands arising\nfrom special relationships \u2018moral obligations\u2019 or\n\u2018non-moral obligations.\u2019 What matters is whether these\ndemands are actually reasons, or whether they are mere obligations of\nrole or position, where the latter are really just shorthand for\nsocial expectations or understandings. If special obligations are\ngenuine reasons, we need to decide whether they can only arise from\nrelationships or commitments that satisfy independent moral criteria,\nor whether they can arise from friendships, promises, etc., which are\nsuch that we might very well have had moral reasons not to enter or to\nmake. Even, however, friendships, for example, that were morally\nacceptable for us to enter may place demands upon us that run counter\nto impartial moral demands. After all, even good people can require\nhelp in getting themselves out of bad situations. It is always\nimportant to remember, however, that no plausible account of special\nobligations will view them as always being all-things-considered\nreasons for action. So even if special obligations can direct us to do\nthat which is wrong or bad on other grounds, it does not immediately\nfollow that we ought to act on our special obligations. It seems quite\nclear that if I learn that my dearest friend in the world is a serial\nkiller, even though I have an obligation to protect him, I also have\nvery strong reason to turn him in to the police, and that what I ought\nto do is to act on that latter reason.\n\nHowever, there will be other times such that our special obligations\nare weighty enough that we ought to do that which, in other\ncircumstances, would be immoral for us to do. But this should not be\nsurprising or troubling to us, if we accept that friendship, promises,\ncollegial relationships, etc., have moral, or at least rational,\nsignificance. Such significance inevitably changes the landscape of\nreasons.\n9. Extending the Moral Domain\n\nAnimal ethics is a burgeoning field in ethics. The most famous work in\nthe area is, of course, that done by utilitarian Peter Singer, who\nargued that the best consequences will be brought about if we become\nvegetarians, thereby ending the terrible suffering endured by animals\nraised for food. Following in Singer\u2019s footsteps, much of animal\nethics is concerned with issues surrounding the use of animals for\nfood, scientific research, and entertainment purposes, legal issues\naddressing overt cruelty to animals, and how to deal with rapidly\nincreasing populations of both domestic and wild animals.\n\nBut, recently, some philosophers have begun to focus their attention\non companion animals, i.e., those cats, dogs, fish, birds, etc., that\nmany of us take into our homes and care for as pets. (See\nBurgess-Jackson, Rollin, Palmer.) Americans spend small fortunes\nproviding medical care for their animal companions, and lavish time,\nattention, and love on them. Many of us regard our cats or dogs as\nmembers of our family, and we feel ourselves obligated to take special\ncare of our animal companions. But can we really have special\nobligations to non-human animals? If not, how can we possibly justify\nthe resources expended on companion animals, given the amount of human\nsuffering in the world?\n\nIn order adequately to address the question whether we have special\nobligations to our companion animals, we need to do more investigation\ninto the nature of the relationship that we have to animals and the\nnature of our companion animals. Can we be friends with creatures\nother than human beings? (See Jeske 2008b.) Can we make promises to\nanimals? Can we bear relevant psychological connections to animals?\nThese questions need serious attention if we are to insure that we\nmeet our moral obligations to the vulnerable creatures that we call\npets.\n10. Conclusion\n\nWe have seen that the issue as to whether we have special obligations\nis relevant to some of the central issues in contemporary ethics,\nincluding the viability of consequentialism as a moral theory, the\npossibility and nature of agent-relative reasons, the relationship\nbetween voluntary action or association and the acquisition of duties\nor responsibilities, and the nature of self, family, friendship, and\npolitical community. In attempting to ground special obligations, the\ndefender of special obligations must face issues about the role of the\nmetaphysics of personal identity in determining features of morality\nand questions in moral epistemology, among other issues. Thus, the\ntopic of special obligations is central to debates in both normative\nand meta- ethics.\n",
