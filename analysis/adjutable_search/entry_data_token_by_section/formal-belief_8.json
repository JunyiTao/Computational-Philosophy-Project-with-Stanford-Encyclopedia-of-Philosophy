    "main_text": "Full and Partial Belief || Eliminationism\n4.1 Eliminationism\n\nThere are those who deny that there are any interesting principles\nbridging full and partial belief. Theorists of this persuasion often\nwant either to eliminate one of these attitudes or reduce it to a\nspecial case of the other. Jeffrey (1970) suggests that talk of full\nbelief is vestigial and will be entirely superseded by talk of partial\nbelief and utility:\n\n\u2026 nor am I disturbed by the fact that our ordinary notion of\nbelief is only vestigially present in the notion of degree of\nbelief. I am inclined to think Ramsey sucked the marrow out of the\nordinary notion, and used it to nourish a more adequate view. But\nmaybe there is more there, of value. I hope so. Show me; I have not\nseen it at all clearly, but it may be there for all that.\n\n\nTheorists such as Kaplan (1996) also suggests that talk of full belief\nis superfluous once the mechanisms of Bayesian decision theory are in\nplace. After all, only partial beliefs and utilities play any role in\nthe Bayesian framework of rational deliberation, whereas full belief\nneed not be mentioned at all. Those committed to full beliefs have the\nburden of showing how rationality will be the poorer without recourse\nto full belief. Kaplan calls this the Bayesian Challenge.\nStalnaker (1984) is much more sympathetic to a qualitative notion of\nbelief, but acknowledges the force of the Bayesian challenge. \n\nIt is true that there is no canonical qualitative analogue to the\nBayesian theory of practical deliberation. However, the fact that it\nis the theorist of full belief that feels the challenge, and not \nvice versa, may be an accident of history: if a qualitative\ntheory of practical deliberation had been developed first, the shoe\nwould now be on the other foot. The situation would be even more\nsevere if qualitative decision making, which we seem to implement as a\nmatter of course, were less cognitively demanding than its Bayesian\ncounterpart. Of course, this anticipates a robust theory of rational\nqualitative deliberation that is not immediately forthcoming. However,\nrecent work such as Lin (2013) and Spohn (2017a, 2019) may remedy that\ninadequacy. For example, Lin (2013) proves a Savage-style\nrepresentation theorem characterizing the relationship between full\nbeliefs, desires over possible outcomes and preferences over acts. By\ndeveloping a theory of rational action in terms of qualitative belief,\nLin demonstrates how one might answer the Bayesian challenge. \n\nOn the other hand there are partisans of full belief that are deeply\nskeptical about partial beliefs. See Harman (1986), Pollock (2006),\nMoon (2017), Horgan (2017) and the \u201cbad cop\u201d in\nH\u00e1jek and Lin (2017). Many of these object that partial beliefs\nhave no psychological reality and would be too difficult to reason\nwith if they did. Horgan (2017) goes so far as to say that typically\n\u201cthere is no such psychological state as the agent\u2019s\ncredence in \\(p\\)\u201d and that Bayesian epistemology is \u201clike\nalchemy and phlogiston theory: it is not about any real phenomena, and\nthus it also is not about any genuine norms that govern real\nphenomena.\u201d Harman (1986) argues that we have very few explicit\npartial beliefs. A theory of reasoning, according to Harman, can\nconcern only explicit attitudes, since these are the only ones that\ncan figure in a reasoning process. Therefore, Bayesian epistemology,\nwhile perhaps an account of dispositions to act, is not a guide to\nreasoning. Nevertheless, partial beliefs may be implicit in our system\nof full beliefs in that they can be reconstructed from our\ndispositions to revise them:\n\nHow should we account for the varying strengths of explicit beliefs? I\nam inclined to suppose that these varying strengths are implicit in a\nsystem of beliefs one accepts in a yes/no fashion. My guess is that\nthey are to be explained as a kind of epiphenomenon resulting from the\noperation of rules of revision. For example, it may be that \\(P\\) is\nbelieved more strongly than \\(Q\\) if it would be harder to stop\nbelieving \\(P\\) than to stop believing \\(Q\\), perhaps because it would\nrequire more of a revision of one\u2019s view to stop believing \\(P\\)\nthan to stop believing \\(Q\\) (p. 22).\n\n\nOn this picture, almost all of our explicit beliefs are qualitative.\nPartial beliefs are not graded  belief attitudes toward\npropositions, but rather dispositions to revise our  full\nbeliefs. The correct theory of partial belief, according to Harman,\nhas more to do with entrechment orders (see Section 2.2.2) or\nranking-theoretic degrees of belief (see Section 3.4) than with\nprobabilities. Other apparently partial belief attitudes are explained\nas full beliefs  about objective probabilities. So, in the\ncase of a fair lottery with ten thousand tickets, the agent does not\nbelieve to a  high degree that the \\(n^{th}\\) ticket will not\nwin, but rather fully believes that it is objectively improbable that\nit will win.\n\nFrankish (2009) objects that Harman\u2019s view requires that an\nagent have a full belief in any proposition that we have a degree of\nbelief in: \u201cAnd this is surely wrong. I have some degree of\nconfidence (less than 50%) in the proposition that it will rain\ntomorrow, but I do not believe flat-out that it will rain \u2013 not,\nat least, by the everyday standards for flat-out belief.\u201d Harman\nmight reply that Frankish merely has a full belief in the objective\nprobability of rain tomorrow. Frankish claims that this escape route\nis closed to Harman because single events \u201cdo not have objective\nprobabilities,\u201d but this matter is hardly settled.\n\nStaffel (2013) gives an example in which a proposition with a higher\ndegree of belief is apparently less entrenched than one with a lower\ndegree of belief. Suppose that you will draw a sequence of two million\nmarbles from a big jar full of red and black marbles. You do not know\nwhat proportion of the marbles are red. Consider the following\ncases:\n\n\n(1)\nYou have drawn twenty marbles, 19 black and one red. Your degree\nof belief that the last marble you will draw is black is \\(.95\\).\n\n\n(2)\n You have drawn a million marbles, 900,000 of which have been\nblack. Your degree of belief that the last marble you will draw is\nblack is \\(19/20=.90\\).  \n\n\nStaffel argues that your degree of belief in the first case is higher\nthan in the second, but much more entrenched in the second than in the\nfirst. Therefore, degree of belief cannot be reduced to degree of\nentrenchment. Nevertheless, the same gambit is open to Harman in the\ncase of the marbles\u2013he can claim that in both scenarios you\nmerely have a full belief in a proposition about objective chance. See\nStaffel (2013) for a much more extensive engagement with Harman\n(1986). \n",
