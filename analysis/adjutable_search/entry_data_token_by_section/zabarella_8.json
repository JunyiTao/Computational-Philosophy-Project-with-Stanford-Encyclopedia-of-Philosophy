    "main_text": "Natural Philosophy and Medicine\n9. Aftermath\n\n\nFrom the things considered above, it becomes clear that Zabarella\ncannot be considered as a precursor of modern experimental science. In\nspite of its empirical basis, Zabarella\u2019s natural philosophy is not\nconcerned with anything akin to experiment. Indeed, if experiments\nwere to be developed, they would find their place in the productive\narts rather than in natural philosophy. Zabarella did not use\nexperiments in order to verify or falsify theories in the modern\nsense.  (Schmitt 1969) However, he made observations of natural\nthings, but they were just made to exemplify and illustrate the\ndemonstrative reasoning used in the theoretical natural\nphilosophy (Rossi 1983, p. 146).\n\n\nDuring the past decades Zabarella\u2019s name has been linked to modern\nscience. John Herman Randall published already in 1940 (and again in\n1961) his famous idea on \u201cthe School of Padua\u201d that would\nhave been the precursor of modern science. Following Ernst Cassirer,\nRandall referred to the Renaissance discussions of\nregressus-method up to Zabarella as a preparation for Galileo\nGalilei\u2019s new method of natural science. However, the Aristotelian\nterminology and doctrines that Zabarella and Galileo share, seem for\nthe most part to have been commonplaces of late medieval and\nRenaissance thought. Galileo may have known Zabarella\u2019s writings, but\nfar more important source for Galileo was the Jesuit scholars, above\nall Paolo della Valle, working at the Collegio Romano at\nRome (Wallace 1999, p. 338).\n\n\nInstead of overemphasizing the connection between Zabarella and\nGalileo, it should be noted that Zabarella\u2019s thought had a large\nimpact among Protestant Aristotelians in Germany and in the Low\nCountries during the late sixteenth century and first part of the\nseventeenth century (Backus 1989; Maclean 2002). Zabarella\u2019s books\nwere known even in the remote Scandinavian countries surprisingly\nearly already at the turn of the seventeenth-century (Mikkeli\n2002). Zabarella\u2019s clear and systematic interpretation of Aristotle\u2019s\nlogic and natural philosophy was used as a basis for numerous\nAristotelian textbooks printed in Germany. Moreover, the Protestant\nacademics found Zabarella\u2019s instrumentalist view of logic useful for\ntheir theological purposes (Kusukawa 2002). Also in the British Isles\nthe Scholastic revival of the early seventeenth century owed much to\nZabarella\u2019s writings (Sgarbi 2012; Sgarbi 2013, 53\u201378). Recently\nthere has been some considerations whether Zabarella\u2019s distinction\nbetween the objects of science (res considerata) and the way\nof considering (modus considerandi) had an impact on the\ndistinction between matter and form in Immanuel Kant\u2019s philosophy\n(Sgarbi 2010). Even some modern scholars of Aristotle have still\nconsulted his commentaries with profit.\n",
