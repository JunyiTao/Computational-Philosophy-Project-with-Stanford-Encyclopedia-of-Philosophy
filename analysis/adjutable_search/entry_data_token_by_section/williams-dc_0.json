    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\nDonald Williams was born on 28 May 1899 in Crows Landing, California,\nat that time a strongly rural district, and died in Fallbrook, also in\nhis beloved California, and also at that time far from cities, on 16\nJanuary 1983. His father was Joseph Cary Williams, who seems to have\nbeen a jack of all countrymen\u2019s trades; his mother Lula Crow, a\nlocal farmer\u2019s daughter. Donald was the first in his family to\npursue an academic education. After studies in English Literature at\nOccidental College (BA 1923), he went to Harvard for his Masters, this\ntime in Philosophy (AM 1925). He then undertook further graduate study\nin philosophy, first at the University of California at Berkeley\n(1925\u201327), then at Harvard, where he took his PhD in 1928.\n\nAlso in 1928 he married Katherine Pressly Adams, from Lamar, Colorado,\nwhom he had met at Berkeley, where she was something of a\npioneer\u2014a woman graduate student in psychology. In time, there\nwere two sons to the marriage. The couple spent a year in Europe in\n1928\u201329 (\u201cimmersing himself in Husserl\u2019s\nPhenomenology to the point of immunization\u201d, Firth, Nozick and\nQuine 1983, p 246). Then Donald began his life\u2019s work as a\nProfessor of Philosophy, first spending ten years at the University of\nCalifornia, Los Angeles, and then from 1939 until his retirement in\n1967, at Harvard.\n\nThroughout his long and distinguished career in philosophy he retained\na down-to-earth realism and naturalism in metaphysics, and a\nconservative outlook on moral and political issues, characteristic of\nhis origins. A stocky, genial, and cheerful man, he found neither the\ncontent nor the validation of ethics to be problematic. Although\noriginally a student of literature, whose first publication was a book\nof poetry, he had not the slightest tincture of literary or academic\nbohemianism. He was among the very least alienated academics of his\ngeneration; which is not surprising, as his career was indeed one\nversion of The American Dream.\n",
