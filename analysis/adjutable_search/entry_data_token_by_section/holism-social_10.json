    "main_text": "Why Purely Holist Explanations Can Sometimes Stand on Their Own || The Argument from Underlying Social-Level Mechanisms\n4.1 The Argument from Underlying Social-Level Mechanisms\n\nThe argument from underlying social-level mechanisms purports to\nestablish that purely holist explanations may sometimes be accompanied\nby underlying social-level rather than individual-level mechanisms\n(see e.g., Kaidesoja 2013; Kincaid 1997: 111; Mayntz 2004; Vromen\n2010; Wan 2012; Ylikoski 2012).\n\nThe argument begins by noting that social phenomena are at a higher\nlevel of organization than individuals. Note that this is why accounts\nof individual-level mechanisms qualify as specifications of the\nunderlying mechanisms. What is sometimes overlooked, the\nargument continues, is that social phenomena may themselves be at\nhigher or lower levels of organization. For instance, a nation or a\nstate is typically at a higher level of organization than a small firm\nor a school. This observation paves the way for the contention that a\npurely holist explanation should sometimes be accompanied by an\naccount of the underlying mechanisms involving lower-level social\nphenomena. These explanations are still holist explanations.\nAccordingly, it is concluded, holist explanations may sometimes stand\non their own in that they do not need individual-level\nmicrofoundations.\n\nThe argument from underlying social-level mechanisms makes it plain\nthat the adoption of the mechanism model of explanation does not lend\nsupport to the view that purely holist explanations need always be\naccompanied by accounts of individual-level microfoundations. The\nmodel states that an explanation, or a satisfactory or complete\nexplanation, describes how one phenomenon, via underlying mechanisms,\nbrought about another phenomenon, and this is perfectly compatible\nwith accounts of the underlying mechanisms consisting in descriptions\nof mechanisms at the level of other (though lower-level) social\nphenomena. Thus the argument from underlying social-level mechanisms\ndoes not challenge the mechanism model of explanation. Other arguments\noffered by methodological holists, however, aim to do exactly\nthis.\n",
