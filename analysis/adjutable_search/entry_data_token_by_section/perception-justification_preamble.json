    "main_text": "\n\nWhen you see a ripe lemon in a supermarket, it seems eminently\nreasonable for you to believe that a lemon is there. Here you have a\nperceptual experience since you consciously see something\nyellow. And your experience seems to justify your belief\nsince your experience seems to make it reasonable for you to believe\nthat a lemon is there.\n\nOur perceptual experiences of the world outside us seem to justify our\nbeliefs about how the world outside us is. If that\u2019s right, a\nquestion in the epistemology of perception remains open: how do our\nexperiences justify beliefs about the external world? And a question\nin the philosophy of mind remains open as well: what are our\nexperiences themselves like?\n\nThis entry will survey interactions between the epistemology of\nperception and the philosophy of mind. Following the existing\nliterature, the focus will be on visual perceptual experience. The\nreader is invited to consider how generalizations to other senses\nmight or might not succeed.\n\nSection 1 considers theories of experience and what implications they\nmight have for the epistemology of perception. Section 2 considers\nperceptual phenomena, such as attending or dreaming, with special\nimplications for the epistemology of perception.\n",
