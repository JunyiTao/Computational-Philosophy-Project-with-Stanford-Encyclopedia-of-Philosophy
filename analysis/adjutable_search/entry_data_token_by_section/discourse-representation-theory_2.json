In\nthe first one, a sentence DRS was constructed in a compositional way;\nthis part of the construction process we took for granted, but its\nimplementation wouldn\u2019t be too difficult. In the second step, the\nsentence DRS was merged with the DRS representing the prior discourse,\nand anaphoric references were resolved. This two-stage procedure has\nbecome the industrial standard, but the original version of DRT (Kamp\n1981, Kamp and Reyle 1993) was monostratal in the sense that one set\nof rules took care of both tasks at once. In the meantime, Kamp and\nhis co-workers have adopted the two-step method, too (e.g., Kamp et\nal.  2011).\nIn one-level versions of DRT, a single set of rules is used to\nobtain the semantic contribution of a sentence. To take a simple\nexample, if the sentence is \u201cIt is grey\u201d, the first rule\nto apply will say that the semantic correlate of the subject is an\nargument to the predicate expressed by \u201cis grey\u201d. Then the\ntwo main parts of the sentence are analysed further, and the pronoun\n\u201cit\u201d triggers a rule which at once deals with the\npronoun\u2019s lexical content and its context dependence; i.e., it says\nthat we must select a new discourse referent, link it to a discourse\nreferent made available by the preceding discourse, and update the DRS\nso as to record these changes. In two-level versions of DRT there is\nno such rule. Its duties are divided between two separate\nmechanisms. In the first stage, a separate DRS is constructed for the\nsentence, in which pronouns prompt the introduction of new discourse\nreferents that are marked as being anaphoric (we use underlining for\nthis purpose). In the second stage, there is a general mechanism for\ndealing with discourse referents thus marked.\nThe distinction between one- and two-level versions of DRT is of\ninterest for at least two reasons. First, once we go beyond basic DRT,\nthe two-stage system may actually be more economical overall. For\nexample, if DRT is extended for dealing with presuppositions (see\nSection 5), the one-pass approach becomes unwieldy. Secondly, and\nperhaps more importantly, two-stage theories may be viewed as\nimplementing a distinction between semantics and pragmatics which has\nsome prima facie plausibility: in the first stage a representation is\ncomputed which is projected from the sentence\u2019s lexico-grammatical\nstructure, while in the second stage, context-dependent aspects of\nmeaning are dealt with.  This division of labor is reminiscent of the\ntraditional dichotomy between compositional semantics and\nnon-compositional pragmatics, but it should be noted that the two do\nnot coincide. Usually, the \u201csemantical\u201d part of a\ntwo-stage version of DRT is not compositional in the Fregean sense,\nbecause its output is essentially incomplete; it may contain anaphoric\n\u201cgaps\u201d, for example. Therefore, even if a sentence DRS\nadmits of a truth-conditional interpretation, it will typically fall\nshort of capturing everything that is conventionally thought to belong\nto truth-conditional content.\n",
