God as the First Object of our Knowledge (primum cognitum)\n\n\nIn describing the role of divine illumination in the cognitive\nprocess of the human intellect (see above, \u00a72), Henry is always\ncareful to specify that God functions only as ratio\ncognoscendi and not as obiectum cognitum. From another\nperspective, however, God is also the first known object of the human\nintellect, according to one of Henry's most famous and\ncharacteristic doctrines (Summa, art. 24, q. 7). The apparent\ncontrast between these two theories is lessened when we recognize that\nfor Henry God is the primum cognitum of our intellect, not\nbecause of the evidence, but because of the absolute indeterminacy of\nour concept of God.\n\n\nFor Henry, the more indeterminate an intelligible, the more quickly\nit is grasped naturally by our intellect (\u201c\u2026et sic\nuniversaliter quanto intelligibile magis est indeterminatum, tanto\nnaturaliter prius ipsum intellectus noster intelligit\u201d;\nSumma, art. 24, q. 7, ed. 1520, f. 144rG). While God is not\nthe first but the last concept in the order of rational knowledge,\nafter the knowledge of creatures, He is the first object of natural\nknowledge, which is had in the first intentions and in which our\nintellect always proceeds from what is most indeterminate. Concerning\nany thing, our intellect first grasps (by nature) the fact of its being\nan entity and then the fact of its being that determined\nentity, even though chronologically the opposite seems true. Actually,\nwe seem to grasp a thing first as a stone and then as a being in\ngeneral, though in the natural order we can only know something as a\nstone because we have implicitly recognized it as a being.\n\n\nThere are, however, two different kinds of indeterminacy: privative\nindeterminacy (the mere absence of determination, that is, the\nindeterminacy of what can be conceived regardless of its\ndeterminations, though being in itself fully determinable) and\nnegative indeterminacy (that is, the indeterminacy of what is so\nsimple and subsistent as not to allow any further determination).\n\n\nThe first kind of indeterminacy pertains to the concept of being in\ngeneral and to the other primary notions (one, true, good etc.); the\nsecond one pertains to subsistent Being and Good, that is, to\nGod. Since the latter indeterminacy is actual, whereas the first\nderives only from the \u2018privation\u2019 of any additional determination, the\nnegatively indeterminate Being (God) is clearly more indeterminate\n(and indeterminable) than what is only privatively indeterminate (the\nconcept of being), even though this does not imply that negative\nindeterminacy has a greater extension than privative indeterminacy\n(what is privatively indeterminate is always more universal). Yet this\nis enough to state that in conceiving any determinate being our\nintellect also conceives indeterminate being, and, together with it,\nin an even more primary way, negatively indeterminate being.\n\n\nWhat is valid for being may also be\napplied to the other first intentions, though the concept of\nens still remains the most indeterminate and hence\noriginal.\n",
