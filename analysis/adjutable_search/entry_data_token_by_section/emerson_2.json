    "main_text": "Major Themes in Emerson\u2019s Philosophy || Process\n2.2 Process\n\nEmerson is in many ways a process philosopher, for whom the universe\nis fundamentally in flux and \u201cpermanence is but a word of\ndegrees\u201d (CW 2: 179). Even as he talks of \u201cBeing,\u201d\nEmerson represents it not as a stable \u201cwall\u201d but as a\nseries of \u201cinterminable oceans\u201d (CW3: 42). This\nmetaphysical position has epistemological correlates: that there is no\nfinal explanation of any fact, and that each law will be incorporated\nin \u201csome more general law presently to disclose itself\u201d\n(CW2: 181). Process is the basis for the succession of moods Emerson\ndescribes in \u201cExperience,\u201d (CW3: 30), and for the emphasis\non the present throughout his philosophy.\n\nSome of Emerson\u2019s most striking ideas about morality and truth\nfollow from his process metaphysics: that no virtues are final or\neternal, all being \u201cinitial,\u201d (CW2: 187); that truth is a\nmatter of glimpses, not steady views. We have a choice, Emerson writes\nin \u201cIntellect,\u201d \u201cbetween truth and repose,\u201d\nbut we cannot have both (CW2: 202). Fresh truth, like the thoughts of\ngenius, comes always as a surprise, as what Emerson calls \u201cthe\nnewness\u201d (CW3: 40). He therefore looks for a \u201ccertain\nbrief experience, which surprise[s] me in the highway or in the\nmarket, in some place, at some time\u2026\u201d (CW1: 213). This is\nan experience that cannot be repeated by simply returning to a place\nor to an object such as a painting. A great disappointment of life,\nEmerson finds, is that one can only \u201csee\u201d certain pictures\nonce, and that the stories and people who fill a day or an hour with\npleasure and insight are not able to repeat the performance.\n\nEmerson\u2019s basic view of religion also coheres with his emphasis\non process, for he holds that one finds God only in the present:\n\u201cGod is, not was\u201d (CW1:89). In contrast, what Emerson\ncalls \u201chistorical Christianity\u201d (CW1: 82) proceeds\n\u201cas if God were dead\u201d (CW1: 84). Even history, which seems\nobviously about the past, has its true use, Emerson holds, as the\nservant of the present: \u201cThe student is to read history actively\nand not passively; to esteem his own life the text, and books the\ncommentary\u201d (CW2: 5).\n",
