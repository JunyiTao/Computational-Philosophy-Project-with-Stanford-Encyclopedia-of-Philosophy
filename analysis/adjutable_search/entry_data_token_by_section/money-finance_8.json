    "main_text": "Political Philosophy\n5. Political Philosophy\n\nDiscussions about the social responsibility of finance are obviously\npremised on the observation that the financial system forms a central\ninfrastructure of modern economies and societies. As we noted at the\noutset, it is important to see that the system contains both private\nelements (such as commercial banks, insurance companies, and\ninvestment funds) and public elements (such as central banks and\nregulatory bodies). However, issues concerning the proper balance\nbetween these elements, especially the proper role and reach of the\nstate, are perennially recurrent in both popular and philosophical\ndebates.\n\nThe financial system and the provision of money indeed raise a number\nof questions that connect it to the \u201cbig questions\u201d of\npolitical philosophy: including questions of democracy, justice, and\nlegitimacy, at both the national and global levels (on the history of\npolitical thinking about money see Eich 2019, 2020, 2022; Ingham 2004,\n2019; Martin 2013). The discussions around finance in political\nphilosophy can be grouped under three broad areas: financialization\nand democracy; finance, money and domestic justice; and finance and\nglobal justice. We consider these now in turn.\n",
