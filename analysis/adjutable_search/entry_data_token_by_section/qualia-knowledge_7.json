    "main_text": "Objections || No Propositional Knowledge 1: the Ability Hypothesis\n4.3 No Propositional Knowledge 1: the Ability Hypothesis\n\nTwo different versions of the No Propositional Knowledge-View\nhave been proposed. According to the Ability Hypothesis (most\nprominently defended in Lewis 1983, 1988 and in Nemirow 1980, 1990,\n2007), Mary does not acquire any new propositional knowledge after\nrelease (no knowledge about something that is the case, no factual\nknowledge), but only a bundle of abilities (like the ability to\nimagine, remember and recognize colors or color experiences).\nAccording to the Acquaintance Hypothesis proposed by Conee\n(1994), Mary\u2019s new knowledge after release is what he calls\n\u201cacquaintance knowledge\u201d which is neither propositional\nknowledge nor identical to a bundle of abilities.\n\nProponents of the Ability Hypothesis presuppose that Mary\u2019s epistemic\nprogress after release consists in the acquisition of knowing what it\nis like (e.g. to have an experience of blue) and they claim that to\nknow what it is like is to have certain practical abilities.\nAccording to Nemirow \u201cknowing what an experience is like is the\nsame as knowing how to imagine having the experience\u201d (1990,\n495). According to Lewis,\n\n\u2026knowing what it is like is the possession of abilities:\nabilities to recognize, abilities to imagine, abilities to predict\none\u2019s behavior by imaginative experiments (Lewis 1983, 131).\n\n\nA few years later he writes: \n\nThe Ability Hypothesis says that knowing what an experience is like\njust is the possession of these abilities to remember,\nimagine, and recognize. \u2026 It isn\u2019t knowing-that. It\u2019s\nknowing-how (Lewis 1990, 516).\n\n\nBence Nanay suggests that what Mary acquires is the ability to\ndiscriminate between different types of awareness, i.e., to\ndistinguish having or imagining experiences of type E from\nhaving or imagining experiences of other types (2009).\n\nLewis\u2019s main argument for the Ability Hypothesis can be summarized\nlike this. (1) The only alternative to the Ability Hypothesis is what\nhe calls the Hypothesis of Phenomenal Information (HPI).\n(According to the HPI knowing what it is like is propositional in the\nfollowing sense: coming to know what it is like involves the\nelimination of hitherto open possibilities). (2) The HPI is\nincompatible with physicalism. (3) The Ability Hypothesis is\ncompatible with physicalism and explains everything that may be\nexplained by the HPI. Therefore: The Ability Hypothesis should be\npreferred.\n\nNote that the Ability Hypothesis is compatible with the view that we\ndo sometimes acquire propositional knowledge on the basis of getting\nacquainted with a new kind of experience from the first person\nperspective. The following remarks by Levin are hard to deny:\n\n\u2026it would be perverse to claim that bare experience can provide\nus only with practical abilities\u2026. By being shown an unfamiliar\ncolor, I acquire information about its similarities and\ncompatibilities with other colors, and its effects on other mental\nstates: surely I seem to be acquiring certain facts about color and\nthe visual experience of it (Levin 1986, 246; see also Crane 2003).\n\n\nBut, as pointed out by Tye (2000), this does not undermine the Ability\nHypothesis. The Ability Hypothesis implies that there is some\nknowledge that can only be acquired by having experiences of\na particular kind and that this knowledge is nothing but\nknowing-how. This of course does not exclude that there also\nis propositional knowledge that can be acquired by\ngetting acquainted with kinds of experiences from the first person\nperspective. The proponent of the Ability Hypothesis only has to\ninsist that, if there is such propositional knowledge, then\nit need not be acquired on that particular basis but is\naccessible in other ways as well.\n",
