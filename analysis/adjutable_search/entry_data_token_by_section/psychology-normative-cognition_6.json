The developmental trajectory of norm-guided cognition\nin humans appears to exhibit robust similarities across cultures, with\nchildren beginning to participate in normative behavior around the\nsame early age (see House et al. 2013 and Tomasello 2019 for context).\nBetween three and five years of age children exhibit knowledge of\ndifferent kinds of normative rules (Turiel 1983; Smetana 1993; Nucci\n2001), and at as early as three years of age they are able to perform\ncompetently in deontic reasoning tasks (R. Cummins 1996; Beller 2010).\nThey also enforce norms, both when they believe the transgressive\nbehavior was freely chosen (Josephs et al. 2016) but also when they\nunderstand that it was unintentional (Samland et al. 2016) at least in\nsome circumstances (cf. Chernyak & Sobel 2016; also see Barrett et\nal. 2016 and Curtin et al. forthcoming for evidence and discussion of\ncross cultural variation in people\u2019s sensitivity to the mental\nstates of norm violators). Moreover, children are alert to how other\npeople respond to transgressions, showing more positive feelings\ntowards those who enforce a norm violation than toward those who leave\nviolations uncorrected (Vaish et al. 2016).\n\nPerhaps most striking is the ease and rapidity with which children\nacquire norms. Preschoolers have been found to learn norms quickly\n(Rakoczy, Warneken, & Tomasello 2008), even without explicit\ninstruction (Schmidt, Rakoczy, & Tomasello 2011), although\nlearning is facilitated when norms are modeled by adults (Rakoczy,\nHaman, et al. 2010). Children\u2019s enthusiasm for rules\u2014their\n\u201cpromiscuous normativity\u201d (Schmidt, Butler, et al.\n2016)\u2014even appears to outstrip being sensitive to common\nnorm-governed behavior in their social environment. Evidence suggests\nthat sometimes a single observation of an action is sufficient for\nchildren to infer the existence of a norm, and that left to their own\ndevices they will spontaneously create their own norms and teach them\nto others (G\u00f6ckeritz, Schmidt, & Tomasello 2014).\n\nThat said, behaviors that are perceived to be normal in a community are\nparticularly salient to individuals\u2019 norm psychology. Children\nare also normatively promiscuous in that they appear prone to false\npositives in the course of acquisition, seeing behavior as norm-guided\neven when it is merely common, and inferring the presence of normative\nrules when there are none. One series of studies found that when\nparticipants (children and adults from both the United States and\nChina) detected or were told that a type of behavior was common among\na group of people, they came to negatively evaluate group members who\nbehaved in a non-conforming way (Roberts et al. 2018; Roberts, Ho,\n& Gelman 2019). Researchers have investigated this feature of norm\nacquisition from different angles, and have labeled it with various\nnames, including the \u201cdescriptive-to-prescriptive\ntendency\u201d (Roberts, Gelman, & Ho 2017) the \u201ccommon is\nmoral heuristic\u201d (Lindstr\u00f6m et al. 2017), and the\n\u201cinjunctive inference hypothesis\u201d (Davis, Hennes, &\nRaymond 2018, discussing, e.g., Schultz et al. 2007). Since the\nevidence suggests that human normative cognition invites an easy\ninference from the \u201cis\u201d of a perceived pattern of common\nbehavior to the \u201cought\u201d of a norm (Tworek & Cimpian\n2016), philosophers may be tempted to think of this as a\n\u201cnaturalistic fallacy bias\u201d.\n\nAnother line of research suggests that key to understanding the roots\nof human normativity is the fact that human children are\noverimitators. They are not just spontaneous, intuitive, and\nexcellent imitators, but they also tend to copy all of the\nelements in the sequence of a model\u2019s behavior, even when they\nrecognize some of those elements are superfluous to the task at hand\n(Lyons, Young, & Keil 2007; Kenward, Karlsson, & Persson 2011;\nKeupp, Behne, & Rakoczy 2013; Nielsen, Kapit\u00e1ny, &\nElkins 2014, cf. Heyes 2018: chapter 6). Children attend to the\nspecific manner in which an action is carried out rather than merely\nto the goal it is aimed at, and conform to the full script even if\nthey see that the goal can be achieved in some more direct way.\nMoreover, children monitor others to see if they are doing likewise,\nand enforce overimitation on their peers by criticizing those who fail\nto perform the entire sequence of steps (Kenward 2012; Rakoczy &\nSchmidt 2013). Overimitation can lead to the unnecessary expenditure\nof energy on these extraneous behaviors, but the trait may be an\nadaptation nevertheless. According to this argument, the costs of what\nlook like individual \u201cmistakes\u201d are ultimately outweighed\nby the communal benefits generated by a population whose individual\ncapacities for transmitting norms and other cultural variants are more\ninsistent in this way, erring on the side of too much imitation rather\nthan too little (J. Henrich 2015: chapter 7). Whatever it was\ninitially selected for, researchers have suggested that the\npsychological machinery responsible for overimitation makes important\ncontributions to normative cognition. Evidence indicates that this\nmachinery generates strong (perhaps intrinsic) social motivation aimed\nat behavioral conformity with others. When working in conjunction with\na norm system, this source of motivation may also help facilitate\nperformance of the key task of keeping an individual\u2019s behavior\ncompliant, inducing her to conform not just to behaviors she is\nobserving but to those norms she has internalized (Hoehl et al. 2019\nfor overview).\n\nOverimitation is also noteworthy because it may be distinctively\nhuman. For example, although chimpanzees imitate the way conspecifics\ninstrumentally manipulate their environment to achieve a goal, they\nwill copy the behavior only selectively, skipping steps which they\nrecognize as unnecessary (Whiten et al. 2009, also see Clay &\nTennie 2018 for similar results with bonobos). Evidence suggests that\nlearning in human children is comparatively more attuned to peer\ninfluence in other ways as well. Once chimpanzees and orangutans have\nfigured out how to solve a problem, they are conservative, sticking to\nwhatever solution they learn first. Humans, in contrast, will often\nswitch to a new solution that is demonstrated by peers, sometimes even\nswitching to less effective strategies under peer influence\n(Haun, Rekers, & Tomasello 2014).\n\nHowever, other researchers have recently contested the claim that\noverimitation is strictly absent in non-humans (Andrews 2017). This is one front of a much\nlarger debate over which features of human psychology are unique to\nour species, and which are shared with others. Recent work relevant to\nnorms has focused on whether and to what extent species other than\nhumans have the capacities to sustain cumulative culture (Dean et al.\n2014), with plausible cases being made that the basic psychological\nwherewithal is present not just in some great apes but also in\nsongbirds (Whiten 2019) as well as whales and dolphins (Whitehead\n& Rendell 2015). Another area of focus has been on aspects of\nmoral cognition, where much illuminating work has explored the\ncontinuities between humans and other animals (de Waal 2006; Andrews\n& Mons\u00f3 forthcoming). Much of this is relevant to, but does\nnot directly address, the question of whether a psychological capacity\ndedicated to norms is distinctively human, or which of its\ncomponent mechanisms might be present in rudimentary form in other\nanimals. Some have suggested that the propensity to punish, and\nespecially the tendency for third party sanctioning of norm\nviolations, is not found in other species (Riedl et al. 2012; Prooijen\n2018, though see Suchak et al. 2016). Others point to humans\u2019\nexceptional ability to cooperate and their resulting ecological\ndominance, suggesting it provides indirect evidence for the uniqueness\nof our capacities for culturally transmitted norms (J. Henrich 2015;\nBoyd 2017). Not all are convinced, arguing that animals like elephants\n(Ross 2019) and chimpanzees (von Rohr et al. 2011) exhibit socially\nsophisticated behaviors best explained by the presence of\npsychological precursors to core components of the human norm system.\nImportant preliminary progress has been made on this cluster of\nquestions concerning non-human normativity (Vincent, Ring, &\nAndrews 2018; Andrews 2020; Fitzpatrick forthcoming),\nbut much conceptual and empirical\nwork remains to be done.\n",
