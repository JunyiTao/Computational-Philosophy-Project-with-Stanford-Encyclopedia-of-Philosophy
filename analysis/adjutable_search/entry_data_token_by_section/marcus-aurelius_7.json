    "main_text": "Piety: Welcoming What Happens as Part of the Whole || Erase Impressions\n4.2 Erase Impressions\n\n\nMarcus often tells himself, \u2018erase (exaleipsai) your\nimpressions (phantasiai)\u2019 (v.2, vii.29, viii.29, ix.7,\ncf. ii.5, iii.16, v.36). According to Stoic epistemology, things in\nthe world impress images of themselves on human and animal souls, as\nshapes can impress themselves on a wax tablet. Human beings may also\nassent to or withhold assent from these impressions; judgments are the\nresult of our assenting to impressions, or more precisely to the\npropositional articulations of our impressions. While assent is\nvoluntary, impressions are not (cf. Epictetus fr. 9). So clearly we\ncan\u2019t erase our impressions in the sense of simply wiping them out,\nbut then what is Marcus telling himself to do? In exchanges with\nAcademic skeptics, the Stoics say that the wise person does not assent\nexcept to impressions that represent accurately the thing in the world\nthat is their cause (\u2018kataleptic\u2019 impressions); how does\nMarcus\u2019 injunction to \u2018erase\u2019 impressions relate to this\nstandard?\n\n\nAccording to Hadot (103\u20134), by \u2018erase impressions\u2019\nMarcus means \u2018assent only to objective and physical descriptions\nof externals\u2019. What Marcus is telling himself to erase,\nHadot says, is value-judgments about everything external to his\ncharacter. Hadot thinks Marcus is simply confused in using the\nterm phantasia for these judgments (the correct term, which he\nsometimes uses [cf. iv.39, v.26, viii.4], and which he sometimes\ndistinguishes from phantasia [cf. viii.47\u201349], is\nhupol\u00eapsis or \u2018assumption\u2019).\n\n\nYet the distinction between objective physical facts and subjective\nvalue judgments seems more existentialist than Stoic\u2014for the Stoics\nvalue is objective, and indeed Marcus repeatedly exults in the beauty\nand goodness of the cosmos as a whole. (We should not assume that\nthe evaluations are all added by us, the subjects, to the impression,\nfor the Stoics think that there are evaluative impressions, cf.\nEpictetus fr. 9.) Nevertheless, it is right that Marcus,\nfollowing Epictetus, recommends refraining from judging\n\u2018good\u2019 or \u2018bad\u2019 since those describe only\nvirtue and vice and none but the fully virtuous person really knows\nthose (see, e.g., Encheiridion 45). And it is also right that\nMarcus often deals with things that are conventionally accorded high\nvalue in reductive material terms. So, for example, he\nwrites,\n\n\nTake for instance the impression in the case of relishes and such\nedibles, that this one is the corpse of a fish, and that one of a bird or\na pig. And again that this Phalernian [wine] is the little juice of\na bunch of grapes, and the purple-edged robe is sheep\u2019s wool dyed\nby the blood of a shellfish; and in the case of things having to do\nwith sexual union [that it is] friction of the genitals with the\nexcretion of mucus in spasms. Such are the impressions that get\nat things and go right into them, so that one sees how each thing\nreally is. (vi.13, cf. viii.21, 24)\n\n\nIndeed, Marcus himself describes what he is doing here as defining\nwhat each thing is stripped naked, and enumerating the components into\nwhich it disintegrates (iii.11); elsewhere he adds that this technique\nleads one to despise the thing so analyzed (xi.2).\n\n\nHowever, this is only one of two complementary ways Marcus deals\nwith his impressions. The other is to consider things that are\nconventionally disvalued in their larger context, so as to show what\ngood they serve. Indeed, the passage recommending the examination\nof each thing stripped naked continues,\n\n\n\u2026 nothing is so productive of greatness of mind as to be able to\nexamine, systematically and in truth, each of the things that befall us\nin life, and to look always at it so as to consider what sort of use\n(chreia) it provides for what sort of cosmos and what value\n(axia) it has for the whole, and what in relation to the human\nbeing, they being a citizen of the highest city, of which other cities\nare like households (iii.11, cf. viii.11, iv.23, iii.2, vi.36, vii.13,\nx.20, 25)\n\n\nHere Marcus is recommending, for the purpose of correct appreciation\nof the value of things, the reintegration of each thing into its cosmic\ncontext. So contrary to first appearances, the goal is not to\nregard things in the world as stripped of value, but rather, to see\neach thing\u2019s true value, which is determined by considering its\ncontribution to the whole cosmos. The physical description of\neach thing is not a description of its naked physical appearance when\nisolated from everything else, but its reintegration into the beautiful\nand intelligent design of the cosmos. So Marcus writes,\n\n\nFor example, when some parts of baking bread crack open, these\ncracks too, even though in a way they are contrary to the baker\u2019s\norders, are somehow fitting and in their own way rouse eagerness for\nfood. Again, figs, when they are ripest, gape open \u2026 and\nmany other things, if one were to look at them individually, would be\nfar from beautiful of appearance, but nevertheless, on account of their\nfollowing things that come to be by nature, are well-ordered and educate\nour soul. (iii.2)\n\n\nInsight into what is in accordance with nature is gained by\ndetermining, for each thing that obtains, its contribution to, or\nfunctional role in, the cosmos (rather than by looking at what\nregularly happens, or what happens with healthy specimens, etc.).\nAnd once one understands this functional contribution, one is able to\nsee the value of each thing, how beautifully it contributes to a\nwell-designed whole.\n\n\nNow that we have a sense of what erased impressions are to be\nreplaced with, we can return to the questions of what is to be erased,\nand what it is to be erased. Marcus does seem to speak\nindifferently about judgments and impressions: he tells himself\nto erase his impressions, and he tells himself to remove opinion (iv.7,\nviii.40); he tells himself he can bear what his opinion renders\nbearable and do what his impressions deem advantageous or appropriate\n(x.3). But this need not be because Marcus is confused about the\ndifference between an impression and a judgment; he may just be using\nthe term \u2018impression\u2019 more loosely, as his predecessors,\nStoic as well as non-Stoic, do. For the predecessors:\nMarcus\u2019 Stoic role-model, Epictetus, says the Iliad is nothing\nbut impressions and the use of impressions (i.28.13). Marcus\nhimself uses the term \u2018impression\u2019 for a recognition (of\nhis own need to be straightened out, i.7), the conception of a standard\n(of a constitution observing equality before the law) (i.14), the\nimpression a person makes on others (i.15), and an appearance\u2014the\nway a thing strikes someone (i.16). These are all accepted uses\nof the term. So it\u2019s more fruitful to ask: what kind\nof impression are we supposed to erase?\n\n\nPlato\u2019s Protagoras, which greatly influenced the Stoics, can\nhelp us here. This text contrasts the power of phantasia\n(often translated \u2018appearance\u2019) with an art of measurement,\nthe former often going wrong because comparative or perspectival (A\nlooks tall because she\u2019s beside the very short B; B looks taller\nthan A because she\u2019s closer to me), and standing in need of\ncorrection by an unchanging standard (a meter ruler, for example)\n(356b\u201357a). That Marcus may find the same defects of perspective in impressions is suggested indirectly by the\ncorrections he prescribes: inspect your impressions (ii.7, iii.6,\nv.22, viii.13, viii.26); test them by \u2018physicizing, ethicizing,\ndialecticizing\u2019 (viii.13), that is to say, by seeing how they\nfare when tested against your physical, ethical, and dialectical\nunderstanding\u2014all of which are informed by a picture of the\nwhole. In xii.18, he tells himself:\n\n\nAlways look at the whole: what that thing is that gives you such an\nimpression, and undo it, distinguishing it into its cause, its matter,\nits point, the time within which it must come to a stop.\n\n\n\nTo the extent that impressions are involuntary, Marcus\u2019\n\u2018erase\u2019 may mean \u2018override\u2019. He may be\nsaying: for the purposes of action and response, wipe out the\ninfluence of such-and-such impressions (Plato\u2019s Protagoras,\nsimilarly, speaks of rendering the power of appearance unauthoritative\n[356e]); focus instead on your understanding of the whole, which will\ngive you a different impression. However, the Stoics\u2019 image of the mind as a\nwax tablet being impressed by different shapes gives a particular point to talk\nof \u2018erasing.\u2019 The work Marcus is doing is to replace\nan inadequate impression with another impression, this one better grounded in a\ncomprehension of reality. Perhaps making the second mark requires\nerasing the first\u2014or perhaps making the second mark is a means of\nerasing the first, for it may be that the withholding of assent from\ncompelling impressions requires countering them with others.\n\n\nAt v.16, Marcus says that one\u2019s mind will be of the same\ncharacter as the impressions it has. This seems unfair, if\nimpressions are entirely involuntary. Marcus may think that while\ninvoluntary in the moment, impressions are subject to control in the\nlong run. Perhaps if I keep refusing to assent to my present\nimpression that wealth is good, wealth will eventually cease to appear\nto me as good. It is also not implausible that one\u2019s\ncharacter and opinion would influence one\u2019s impressions,\nespecially in the case of evaluative impressions (such as that x is\ngood or to-be-preferred) and impressions that requires some expertise to\nhave (such as that y is the treadle for a foot loom).\n",
