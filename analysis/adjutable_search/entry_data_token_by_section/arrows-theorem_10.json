    "main_text": "The Conditions, again || Social Ordering\n4.2 Social Ordering\nCondition SO requires that the result of aggregating\nindividual preferences is always a weak ordering of the alternatives,\na binary relation among them that is both transitive and connected.\nIntuitively, the result has to be a ranking of the\nalternatives from better to worse, perhaps with ties. There is never\nto be a cycle of social preferences, like the one derived by pairwise\nmajority decision in the paradox of voting,\nin Section 1.\nArrow did not state SO as a separate\ncondition. He built it into the very notion of a social\nwelfare function, arguing that the result of aggregating\npreferences will have to be an ordering if it is to \u201creflect\nrational choice-making\u201d (Arrow 1951 [1963]: 19). Criticized by\nBuchanan (1954) for transferring properties of individual\nchoice to collective choice, Arrow in the second edition of Social\nChoice and Individual Values gave a different rationale. There he\nargued that transitivity is important because it ensures that\ncollective choices are independent of the path taken to them (Arrow\n1951 [1963]: 120). He did not develop this idea further.\nCharles Plott (1973) elaborated a suitable notion of path\nindependence. Suppose we arrive at our choice by what he\ncalled divide and conquer: first we divide the alternatives\ninto some smaller sets\u2014say, because these are more\nmanageable\u2014and we choose from each one. Then we gather together\nall the alternatives that we have chosen from the smaller sets, and we\nchoose again from among these. There are many ways of making the\ninitial division, and a choice procedure is said to be path\nindependent if the choice we arrive at in the end is independent\nof which division we start with (Plott 1973: 1080). In Arrow\u2019s\naccount, social choices are made from some given\n\u201cenvironment\u201d \\(S\\) of feasible alternatives by maximizing a\nsocial ordering \\(R\\): the choice \\(C(S)\\) from among \\(S\\) is the set of\nthose \\(x\\) within \\(S\\) such that for any \\(y\\) within \\(S, xRy\\).  It is not\ndifficult to see how intransitivity of \\(R\\) can result in path\ndependence. Consider again the paradox of voting\nof Section 1.  \\(A\\) is strictly favoured above\n\\(B\\), and \\(B\\) above \\(C\\); but, contrary to transitivity, \\(C\\) is strictly\nfavoured above \\(A\\). Starting with the division \\(\\{\\{A,B\\}, \\{B,C\\}\\}\\),\nour choice from among \\(\\{A,B,C\\}\\) will be \\(\\{A\\}\\); but starting\ninstead with \\(\\{\\{A,C\\}, \\{B,C\\}\\}\\) we will arrive in the end at\n\\(\\{B\\}\\).\nPlott\u2019s analysis reveals a subtlety. The full strength\nof SO is not needed to secure path independence of\nchoice. It is sufficient that social preference is a (complete\nand) quasi-transitive relation, having a strict component\nthat is transitive but an indifference component that, perhaps, is\nnot transitive. Sen (1969: Theorem V) demonstrated the compatibility\nof this weaker requirement with all of Arrow\u2019s other conditions, but\nnoted that the aggregation function he came up with would not\ngenerally be found attractive. Its unattractiveness was no\naccident. Allan Gibbard showed that the only social welfare functions\nmade available by allowing intransitivity of social indifference,\nwhile keeping Arrow\u2019s other requirements in place, are what he\ncalled liberum veto oligarchies (Gibbard 1969, 2014). There\nhas in every case to be some group of individuals, the oligarchs,\nsuch that the society always strictly prefers one alternative to\nanother if all of the oligarchs strictly prefer it, but never does so\nif that would go against the strict preference of any\noligarch.[5] A\ndictatorship, in Arrow\u2019s sense, is a liberum veto oligarchy of\none. Relaxing SO by limiting the transitivity requirement to\nstrict social preferences therefore does not seem a promising way of\nsecuring, in spite of Arrow\u2019s theorem, the existence of acceptable\nsocial welfare functions.\n\n",
