    "main_text": "The Problem of Moral Change || The Argument from Posterity\n5.2 The Moral Change Argument\n\n\nCrummell's Moral Change Argument begins with a tension. He\nclaims that moral enlightenment cannot be caused by non-enlightenment.\nNo \u201crude, heathen people\u201d have ever \u201craised\nthemselves by their own spontaneous energy\u201d to a \u201cmorally\nelevated\u201d state, he argues (\u201cThe Regeneration of\nAfrica\u201d [AA], 435); the efforts of those\n\u201csuperior\u201d in \u201cletters or grace\u201d are generally\nrequired. This implies that moral enlightenment cannot be\nindigenous. Against this restriction on the cause of enlightenment is\nhis concern that, to be effective, the enlightening influence has to\nbecome indigenous. The heathen cannot enlighten themselves,\nyet, since no one can become enlightened by non-indigenous agents,\nenlightened agents have to become indigenous\u2014that is, some\nheathen have to be enlightened\u2014as a condition for the\nenlightenment of the heathen. So how can any heathen be enlightened,\nunless they are already enlightened?\n\n\nCrummell is not pessimistic though, since religious conversion faces\nsimilar obstacles, and often succeeds despite them. The \u201cemployment of\nall indigenous agency,\u201d he announces, is that \u201cgreat principle which\nlies at the basis of all successful propagation of the Gospel\u201d (437).\nThe solution to the dilemma is for the enlightened to be racially and\npsychologically similar to the would-be enlightened. \u201c[M]en of like\nsentiments, feelings, blood and ancestry\u201d are required for moral\nenlightenment, and hence are necessary for moral change. It is\nintriguing that his analysis does not demand affinity of\nthought between the enlightened and the target for moral\nimprovement, a condition it seems reasonable to insist on. Sentiments\nand feelings go to sympathy, whereas blood and ancestry go to racial\nsimilarity; neither is mental. Interestingly, the collision between\nrestricted cause and restricted effect amplifies the importance of\nmoral reason's indifference to this or that race's particular nature,\neven as it is put to use in precisely those situations where such\ndifferences are definitive (racial contact most notably).\n\n\nRaising the stakes for moral change is Crummell's belief that no\nsingle individual ever accomplished anything epochal; \u201ceverywhere\nwe find that the great things of history have been accomplished by\nthe combination of men\u201d (\u201cThe Social Principle Among a People\u201d\n[DR], 31). This is also the case for such moral achievements\nas abolishing slavery. It took \u201cthe masses of the godly\u201d to be\n\u201cmarshaled to earnest warfare\u201d to create moral change on a grand\nscale (32). Thus, significant moral change occurs only in the context\nof social efforts. This is natural given the Social Principle,\nas Crummell calls it: that \u201cdisposition which leads men to\nassociate and join together for specific purposes; the principle\nwhich makes families and societies, and which binds men in unity and\nbrotherhood, in races and churches and nations\u201d (31). We are social by\nnature, since our native \u201csympathies and affections\u201d are the source of\nour \u201cdesire for companionship.\u201d And this can't be opted out of: we were\n\u201cformed\u201d with \u201ca fitness and proclivity for association, \u2026a\nnature that demanded society.\u201d\n\n\nThe Social Principle's transcendental role in moral change can be\nproblematic though. For instance, it is easy to sense in Crummell's\ndescription Du Bois' famous dialectic between two forms of black\nconsciousness, decades before he stated it. Here is how Crummell puts\nit:\n\n\nWe are living in this country, a part of its population, and\nyet, in divers respects, we are as foreign to its inhabitants as though\nwe were living in the Sandwich Islands. It is this our actual\nseparation from the real life of the nation, which constitutes us \u201ca\nnation within a nation\u201d: thrown very considerably upon ourselves for\nmany of the largest interests of life, and for nearly all our social\nand religious advantages. (\u201cSocial Principle,\u201d 32)\n\n\n\nLike the Du Boisian struggle\u2014and echoing Kant's description of\nthe antagonism inherent in \u201cunsociable sociability\u201d\n(\u201cIdea for a Universal History\u201d)\u2014it is one of a\nconsciousness \u201cforeign to\u201d the American consciousness\nnative to the population of \u201cthis country.\u201d This\nforeign-ness creates the \u201cactual separation\u201d that throws\nblacks \u201cupon ourselves.\u201d It is not a contest between equal\nand opposite forces, but a kind of resultant force produced by a\nstronger active force and a weaker passive force.  Crummell's is thus\na sort of Hegelian stand-off: a conflict between blacks and the needs\nand \u201cinterests\u201d and social advantages they seek, a contest\nset up by their natural form.\n\n\nDu Bois and Hegel both saw the effort to be a self-conscious free\nindividual as something that was enacted in historical time. Hegel, for\ninstance, took masters and slaves to coordinate each other's\nachievement of self-consciousness, each seeing themselves in terms of\nwhat the other is capable of doing. Du Bois identifies a similar\ncoordination between the \u201cinner selves\u201d of blacks, one African, the\nother American, both native and alien at the same time. Crummell sees\nblacks opposing themselves in a conflict that cannot be opted out of,\nsince it is a constitutive part of the struggle for self-awareness that\nevery people goes through. He thus moves the focus from where a casual\nobserver might look\u2014the action between blacks and whites, slaves and\nmasters\u2014to an internal struggle\u2014between blacks and their own\nconflicted nature.\n\n\nAs a consequence on this state of things, all the stimulants of\nambition and self-love should lead this people to united effort for\npersonal superiority and the uplifting of the race; but, instead\nthereof, overshadowed by a more powerful race of people; wanting\nin the cohesion which comes from racial enthusiasm; lacking in the\nconfidence which is the root of a people's stability; disintegration,\ndoubt, and distrust almost universally prevail, and distract all their\nbusiness and policies. (\u201cSocial Principle,\u201d 32)\n\n\n\nIt is easy to discern the main threads of Crummell's influence on Du\nBois' later thought.\n\n\nCrummell remains encouraged about African enlightenment through all\nof this, though. Principles of Mutuality and\nDependence follow from the Social Principle, facilitating\nmoral change. The Principle of Mutuality determines those\n\u201creciprocal tendencies and desires which interact between large bodies\nof men, aiming at single and definite ends,\u201d while the Principle\nof Dependence has \u201c[n]o man stand[ing] up entirely alone,\nself-sufficient in the entire circle of human needs\u201d (\u201cSocial Principle,\u201d 33). He observes\nthat \u201cit has taken ten centuries to change [the Englishman] from the\nrudeness of his brutalized forefathers into an enlightened and\ncivilized human being\u201d (34); so too, he thought, for African moral\nchange.\n\n\nIt thus becomes easier to discern Crummell's larger view about how a\npeople can impact the course of history. The active Mental and Moral\nPrinciples of reason start a cycle, causing a people so stirred to\nsatisfy conditions of intellectual and moral enlightenment. Once they\nare enlightened, reason itself\u2014considered as an abstract, global\nresource, the main active force in history\u2014increases in its civilizing\npotential. Thus the history of reason moves forward as a vital, active\nprinciple, completing a feedback loop. For blacks to affect history,\nthey must become civilized, and propagate civilizing reason to push\nhistory forward. (As I describe above, this process is part of each\ngeneration's obligations to posterity within the course of history.)\nFortunately the Social Principle and its corollaries optimize the\nchances of that happening.\n\n\nBut for the cycle to get its start, the \u201cnative\u201d must be\ntrusted with the possibility of civilization\u2014in Matthew Arnold's\nphrase (quoted approvingly by Crummell), the \u201cpossibility of\nright.\u201d Until they achieve that state, they are to be treated\nwith the necessity of tutelage, the \u201cnecessity of force and\nauthority.\u201d \u201cMere theories of democracy\u201d cannot be\napplied to \u201ca rude people, incapable of perceiving their own\nplace in the moral scale, nor of understanding the social and\npolitical obligations\u201d of civilized peoples (\u201cOur National\nMistakes\u201d [AA], 185). \u201cForce and right,\u201d\nCrummell writes, quoting Arnold, \u201care the governors of this\nworld; force till right is ready\u2026.And till right is\nready, force, the existing order of things, is justified, is the\nlegitimate rule.\u201d He agrees with Arnold that right\n\u201cimplies inward recognition\u201d that we must be capable of\nboth \u201cseeing\u201d and \u201cwilling.\u201d Until that is\nattained, until the \u201cnative\u201d outgrows their\n\u201cchildhood,\u201d the enlightened have the\n\u201cresponsibility of guardianship over them.\u201d\n\n\nThis awkward paternalism is difficult for the contemporary reader to\naccept. It must be read, though, in the context of the respect he has\nfor the native intelligence in all groups, his fellow blacks included.\nAgreeing with Mill's caution that force over the native should be that\nwhich fits them to become a nation Crummell insists that force should\nbe the force of restoration and progress (\u201cOur National Mistakes,\u201d 185n). In the \u201cnative\nman's moral constitution\u201d is a \u201cgreat felt need, and a\ngreat object of desire [for] peace, order, and protection\u201d; and\nthey are motivated by an acquisitive principle, \u201cthe impelling\nmotive power in all [their] endurance and weariness\u201d (191). He\nunderstood that there simply was no project without a native African\ncapacity for civilization.\n",
