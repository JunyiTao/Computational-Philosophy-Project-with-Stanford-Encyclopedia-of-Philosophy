Our focus is largely on analytic, primarily\nAnglophone, aesthetic writing and its ancestry in the empirical\ntradition. Aesthetic work occurs elsewhere, inside philosophy and\nbeyond, but it is within the analytic tradition that connections with\nthe sciences of mind have been most investigated, and it is that\ntradition which has been most receptive to empirical theories and\nresults (the work of Merleau-Ponty in the phenomenological tradition\nis an exception; for his influence see, e.g., Solli & Netland\n2021).\n\nCognitive science spans the disciplines of psychology, linguistics,\nneuroscience and philosophy, and its relatively brief history has been\ndominated by the idea that human information processing depends on\ninner representations which are subject to computation (Boden 2006).\nIt now encompasses approaches which challenge this idea, seeking to\nreplace or augment inner representation with dependence on the\nenvironment. This concern with human cognitive architecture is\nexemplified in such developments as Marr\u2019s theory of vision\n(1982), Brooks\u2019 subsumption architecture for robots (1986), and\npredictive processing theories of perception and cognition (Friston\n2010, see also below,\n Section 3).\n A survey of this large domain must be very selective and we have\ntried to identify, for each topic, a small number of key ideas on\nwhich to build our discussion. Throughout we have focused on sources\nthat highlight the issues that confront us when we try to decide when\nsome contribution from the empirical sciences of mind provides a\nrethink of some aesthetic doctrine, when the two disciplines offer\ncomplementary perspectives, and when the one is of no particular\nrelevance to the other.\n", "toc": [{"#Back": "1.

Background\n\nWriters on aesthetics in the empiricist tradition such as Shaftsbury,\nHume, and Reid thought of their contributions as broadly empirical\n(see Shelley 2006 [2020]), and among the very first experimental\ninvestigations in psychology were studies of aesthetic preferences and\nresponses, for example Fechner\u2019s attempt to discover whether the\n\u201cgolden section\u201d is especially preferred to other ratios\n(1871). The late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were rich in\nwork of this kind, and there were more speculative studies of\n\u201cembodied\u201d responses to architectural structures, a debate\nthat brought the term \u201cempathy\u201d to the English language\n(Vischer 1873; Lipps 1903). But for most of the twentieth century\naesthetics was seen, by its proponents and its detractors, as an\n\u201carmchair\u201d project. Wittgenstein, whose conception of\nphilosophy strongly influenced the field\u2019s direction in the\ncentury\u2019s latter half, said\n\n\nThere doesn\u2019t seem to be any connection between what\npsychologists do and any judgement about a work of art. (1967, 19; on\nWittgenstein\u2019s own experimental work on the perception of rhythm\nsee Guter 2020)\n\n\nTo the extent that aesthetics in this period was influenced by\nthinking about the mind it was more often prompted by ideas from\npsychoanalysis (Wollheim 1993). The last thirty years have seen a\nshift back towards empirical inquiry, assisted by a resurgence of\ninterest in the imagination, now often treated as a capacity with an\nevolutionary and developmental history (Fuentes 2020; Harris 2000) and\nas subject to selective damage (Currie 1996).\n\nIt has never been plausible to think of aesthetics as wholly a\npriori. Even those who think its main business is the analysis of\nwidely shared folk concepts (Dickie 1962) will agree that a\nphilosopher of music should have a good deal of knowledge of the\nhistory, art making practices and traditions of criticism of some\nmusical tradition. In this respect aesthetics is closer to the\nphilosophy of physics or economics than it is to metaphysics. There is\nalso a frequently acknowledged connection between aesthetics and the\nstudy of perception. When Baumgarten (1750\u201358) first introduced\nthe term \u201caesthetics\u201d he called it a \u201cscience of\nperception\u201d and according to Nanay (2014: 101)\n\n\nmany, maybe even most traditional problems in aesthetics are in fact\nabout philosophy of perception and can, as a result, be fruitfully\naddressed with the help of the conceptual apparatus of the philosophy\nof perception.\n\n\nThis is a stronger claim than many would make (see Margolis 1960;\nSibley 1965; Schellekens 2006; and Robson 2018) but theses in\naesthetics do sometimes depend on claims, including scientifically\ntractable claims, about the nature of perception. A notable example is\nthe debate about whether perception is cognitively penetrable; if it\nis, the way a picture looks or a piece of music sounds may depend on\nwhat the observer knows about contextual factors (for the rejection of\ncognitive penetrability see Danto 2001; for criticism see Rose &\nNanay 2022).\n\nPhilosophical doubts about the relevance of empirical work to\naesthetics are of various kinds. Some authors merely suggest that\nphilosophers are apt to make hasty generalisations from slender\nexperimental evidence, give insufficient attention to their details\nand limitations, and fail to acknowledge the existence of conflicting\nexpert opinion (Kone\u010dni 2013; Stock 2014). Philosophers,\naestheticians among them, can certainly overestimate their expertise\non occasion and it may well be that they are even more prone to do so\nwhen it comes to empirical matters. None of this points to anything in\nprinciple problematic about their enthusiasm for the empirical. Other\ndoubters emphasise what they see as more systemic dangers. Roger\nScruton (2014) suggests a tendency to try to assimilate aesthetic\nphenomena to available scientific frameworks that turn out to be ill\nfitting; he cites the attempt to use Chomskian linguistics to found a\ngenerative theory of music which, he claims, fails to accommodate\neither music\u2019s structure or purpose. Gordon Graham (2014),\ncontrasting Hume\u2019s aesthetic theory unfavourably with that of\nReid, says that the project of an \u201caesthetic science\u201d must\nignore or deny the role of reason and judgement. Again, one may be\nalive to both kinds of dangers while retaining an openness to\nempirical work. In particular, Graham\u2019s challenge might be\nresponded to by noting that studies of the role actually played by\nreasons in aesthetic judgement point to a sometimes striking\ndisconnect between what people think of as their reasons and the\nfactors that determine their preferences (Lopes 2014 and Irvin 2014;\nsee also below,\n Section 3);\n this can hardly be irrelevant to someone investigating the\nrationality of aesthetic judgement. Further, work which aestheticians\nhave thought of as conceptual analysis in a broad sense has often\npresumed answers to what are in fact empirical questions. Noel Carroll\nsays that\n\n\nThe supposition that aesthetic properties are objective also explains\nbetter how we talk about them than does the projection theory.\n\u2026people involved in disputes about aesthetic properties\n\u2026 speak as if one side of the disagreement is right and the\nother wrong. (Carroll 1999: 117)\n\n\nStudies in the new field of \u201cexperimental philosophy\u201d (for\nsome overviews of this field, as applied to aesthetics, see Cova &\nR\u00e9hault 2018 and Torregrossa 2020) challenge this view. One\nstudy (Cova, Olivola, et al. 2019) gathered more than two thousand\nresponses across 19 countries to an imagined disagreement about\nwhether an object of aesthetic interest is beautiful. It found that in\nall populations the least popular view was that\n\u201csomeone is right and someone is wrong\u201d. The study itself\nhas come in for criticism (Zangwill 2018) but, regardless of its\nsuccess, it highlights the general point that we should not assume\nwithout evidence that the philosopher\u2019s understanding of folk\nconcepts (or folk practice) matches that of the folk themselves:\nsomething that should be of concern to those, such as Dickie, who\nconceive of the work of aestheticians as largely involving the\nelucidation of folk concepts.\n\nThe question discussed above and to which Carroll and the members of\nthe Cova team give such different answers is a higher order question,\nconcerning whether people think of aesthetic judgements as having\nnormative force. We can ask similar questions about lower level\njudgements. Consider the claim that we shouldn\u2019t form aesthetic\njudgements on the basis of testimony, a claim said to be supported by\nour supposed practice of refraining from forming such judgements (Kant\n1790 [2000: 9]; Nguyen 2020: 1127). Contrary to this, Robson (2014)\nargues that this descriptive claim about our judgement forming\npractice is mistaken\u2014something which would, if true, undermine\none significant motivation for the normative claim.\n\nFrom an entirely different perspective, there are those who think that\nphilosophers have very little role to play in answering key aesthetic\nquestions and that we should seek to replace, rather than merely\nsupplement, traditional philosophical methods with more scientific\napproaches. Exemplifying this tendency, Semir Zeki says\n\n\nno theory of aesthetics that is not substantially based on the\nactivity of the brain is ever likely to be complete, let alone\nprofound,\n\n\ngoing on to say that painting is an inquiry into the laws of the brain\nand that what pleases us is what pleases our brains (1999: 1\u20132).\nWhile attitudes such as this may not constitute a complete dismissal\nof philosophical aesthetics they show little awareness of its results,\nor understanding of the limitations of neurological studies. Facts\nabout brain processes do not tell us\u2014at least without some\nsubstantive and controversial bridging premises\u2014what objects are\nart works, or what works have value (see Hyman 2010 for wide ranging\ncriticism of this approach). The relations between empirical work and\nnormative aesthetics will recur throughout this entry.\n2. Bottom-up and Top-Down Approaches to Aesthetics\n\nA good deal of empirical work on the aesthetic, while not deriving\nfrom hostility to philosophical ideas, adopts a \u201cbottom\nup\u201d approach, focusing on the immediate reactions of untutored\nsubjects to simple stimuli. We have seen that, by contrast,\nphilosophical aesthetics is much concerned with normative issues of\njudgement and value, and with the claimed dependence of these things\non training, knowledge and what is sometimes called\n\u201ctaste\u201d, But these empirical studies are not\nphilosophically irrelevant; we should not assume that the aesthetic\nresponses of experts are discontinuous with those of na\u00efve\nsubjects (though for a discussion of the burden of proof here see\nWilliamson 2011), nor that expert judgements are sensitive only to the\nfactors that experts themselves endorse. It is important to ask\nwhether there are baseline aesthetic responses, perhaps invariant\nacross cultures, from which the great variety of aesthetic traditions\nemerge, and which may impose limits on those traditions and their\nproducts (for a defence of this \u201cbottom up\u201d approach to\nexperiments in aesthetic see McManus 2011). W\u00f6lfflin, a founder\nof modern art history, had an interest in questions framed in this\nway: he claimed, for example, that there is a general tendency to\nprefer a rightward placement of a significant object within an image\n(1928). Subsequent research suggests a more complex picture, with\npreference dependent on physical and cultural factors: handedness, and\nwhether one reads/writes left-to-right or right-to-left (see Palmer,\nGardner, & Wickens 2008 for references and discussion; Chahboun et\nal. 2017 found some limited support for the idea that placement\npreference depends on the subject\u2019s direction of\nreading/writing). Other studies have shown robust preferences for\ncertain colours (Palmer & Schloss 2010), shapes, positioning of\nobjects within a frame (Palmer, Gardner, & Wickens 2008) and size\n(Linsen, Leyssen, Sammartino, & Palmer 2011). These preferences\noften turn out to be ecologically driven; for example, people tend to\nlike the colours of liked objects, with strong and culturally\ninvariant liking of saturated blue and invariant hostility to colours\nassociated with faeces and vomit. There are cultural variations; for\nexample Japanese subjects appear to be unusual in their lack of\nenthusiasm for dark red (Palmer & Schloss 2010). Some colour\npreferences are very culturally specific, as with the preferences of\ncollege students for colours associated with their schools (Schloss,\nPoggesi, & Palmer 2011).\n\nStudies such as these may be thought valuable in their capacity to\nexplain persistent features of aesthetic artefact-making but are\nunlikely to provide more than a general background against which\naesthetic preferences and judgements, debates and disagreements\nconcerning particular artefacts are played out. Saturated blue will be\nthe right colour in a certain context, while muddy brown will be right\nin another. We cannot say that the presence of saturated blue in a\npicture is in general a reason, even a pro tanto reason, for\nadmiring it or preferring it to a picture without that colour. When it\ncomes to aesthetic reasons and judgements rather than unreflective\npreferences\u2014when, that is, we consider top-down\neffects\u2014cognitive science so far offers little to help us. This\nmay to some extent be due to the nature of human cognition itself.\nAesthetic reasons, in so far as we have them at all, are highly\nresistant to formulation in general terms (Sibley 1959), and once we\nabandon the view that aesthetic qualities supervene on an\nobject\u2019s appearance narrowly described (colour, shape and size\nin the case of visual art), there is no obvious way to limit the\nfactors that legitimately impact on such judgements. This suggests a\ndomain where, roughly speaking, everything is relevant to everything:\nthe isotropy that is crucial to Fodor\u2019s (1983) scepticism about\na cognitive science of thinking. One recent study does attempt a\nunification of top-down and bottom-up approaches. Bullot and Reber\n(2013) develop a \u201cpsycho-historical\u201d process that begins\nwith a perceptual confrontation with the work, and culminates in\nartistic understanding, mediated by the viewer\u2019s adoption of the\ndesign stance which involves reconstructing the genealogy of the work.\nThis approach encounters two difficulties. First is their assumption\nthat progress between stages is able to be done largely by the\nextraction of information from the perceptual signal. In fact the\nwork\u2019s appearance is often ambiguous or misleading as to its\nhistory\u2014as when a work is carefully constructed to look\nhaphazard in its construction (Levinson 2013; Ross 2013). The model\nneeds to recognise the importance of art-historical knowledge gained\nfrom such sources as lectures and text books, knowledge which will\noften precede and inform the first stage. The second objection\nconcerns the role of presumed essentialist assumptions in\npeople\u2019s approach to art works. Bullot and Reber argue that the\nhistorical nature of appreciation is explained by our commitment to\npsychological essentialism which makes us look beyond a things\nappearance to investigate its essence (2013: 132). But an inclination\nto look beyond appearances need not depend on essentialism; it might\nbe that the interest or value of a thing sometimes resides in its\nrelational and contingent properties (Korsgaard 1983). Valuing a work\non account of its history of making no more implies an essential\nconnection between the work and its history than valuing an object\nbecause it was a gift from a loved one implies an essential connection\nbetween the object and the giver.\n3. Preference, Judgement and Reasons\n\nAs well as studies designed to elicit preferences, there are\nempirically motivated theories that purport to explain them. Among the\nearliest is Wundt\u2019s (1874) suggestion that we judge a form\npleasing to the extent that the eye finds it easy to follow the\ncontour. Recent work generalises this thought: there is said to be a\ntendency for stimuli to be experienced positively when our perceptual\nor cognitive grasp on them comes easily (Reber, Schwarz, &\nWinkielman 2004). This idea of processing fluency is not\nlimited to the aesthetic domain; we generally find a proposition more\nbelievable, apparently, if it is expressed in rhyme or in an easy to\nread font and this is said to be because these things increase fluency\n(Reber & Schwarz 1999; McGlone & Tofighbakhsh 2000). So\naesthetic and fluent phenomena are not coextensive, and no reduction\nof the one to the other is possible. The most that can be said (and\nthis is not insignificant) is that certain kinds of fluency underpin\nexperiences of aesthetic pleasure and displeasure, symmetry offering a\nplausible example; for comments on the significance of such research\ninto underlying mechanisms see\n Section 4\n below.\n\nOne concern about an approach to the aesthetic by way of fluency is\nthat fluency apparently encourages a less careful examination of the\nstimulus (Song & Schwarz 2008), a suggestion at odds with the\naesthetic ideal of a finely discriminating attitude to art. Another is\nthat fluency-based likings for stimuli seem to have very limited\napplication in aesthetics beyond the domain of simple shape\npreferences. Pictures which are visually complex are often widely\nadmired and not merely by the art-world elite (see for example\nFrith\u2019s busy genre paintings). It is said that the pleasure\nderived from fluency is relative to expectation: pleasure taken in a\nBach fugue depends on it being more fluent than one expects (Reber\n2012: 228, citing Hansen, Dech\u00eane, & W\u00e4nke 2008). But\nwhy must lovers of Bach have unrealistic expectations about the\nfluency of his music? Finally (a theme we will return to) citing\nfluency would not be a reason for admiring the picture or fugue in\nquestion; this approach seems to focus on pleasure and leave notions\nof reason and judgement out of account. (For criticism of the fluency\nprogram in aesthetics see Cochrane 2021a, Section 2.3.)\n\nAnother aspect of fluency is said to be the mere exposure effect: our\ntendency to find a statement more believable if we have heard it\noften, repeated hearings leading to progressively more fluent\nprocessing (Begg, Anas, & Farinacci 1992). Cutting (2003)\ninvestigated an aesthetic variant of the idea: liking for a picture is\nincreased by repeated exposure to it. This, it is suggested, may\nexplain the stability of the artistic canon: works canonical at\nt are more available to be seen, and the mere exposure effect\nraises the likelihood of their being canonical at t + 1.\nCutting does not claim that exposure is the only factor contributing\nto aesthetic judgement, so accepting this view does not make one an\nerror theorist about aesthetic value. It does, however suggest that\nthe critical robustness of canonical judgements has been\noverestimated, since one\u2019s exposure to a picture is not a reason\nfor thinking it good. However, Meskin, Phelan, and colleagues (2013)\ncompared the effect of mere exposure to (what critics have widely\njudged to be) good and bad art, finding that there was increased\nliking for good art but decreased liking for bad art, the implication\nbeing that increased exposure makes observers more aware of the\nobjective qualities of the work (see also Delplanque et al. 2015). In\nthat case significant exposure to a work, while not a reason why it is\ngood or bad, is a reason why one\u2019s judgement of it is reliable\nand so may be said to belong to the space of aesthetic reasons.\nCutting (2017), while offering some methodological reservations,\nexpresses broad agreement with the Meskin et al. study.\n\nRecently the link between aesthetic effects and pervasive features of\nperception and cognition has been highlighted again by the theory of\npredictive processing: the idea that the fundamental activity\nof the brain is to make predictions and test and revise them against\nincoming information from the senses, the goal being the reduction in\npredictive errors or what is also called reduction in uncertainty (for\na survey of philosophical applications of this idea see Hohwy . It is\nsuggested that positive affect is the product of such reductions,\nwhile negative affect results when uncertainty is increased. Works of\nart are said to provide the brain with exercises, sometimes\nchallenging ones, in error reduction (van de Cruys & Wagemans\n2011). But why should we seek more exercises in prediction error\nreduction than the many that the world throws at us continually? What\nis to say that the eventual reduction in error outweighs the initial\nincrease posed by a work of art?\n\nWe see, then, that there are a number of suggestions for how empirical\nwork may shed light on our aesthetic preferences and their aetiology,\nwhile doubts remain about the capacity of this work to illuminate the\nnormative structure of aesthetic judgement, which is said to be\nreason-focused and involve Kantian features such as disinterestedness\n(though see Meskin, Phelan, et al. 2013: 140\u20131). A second and\nfamiliar objection is the Wittgensteinian thought that merely\nexplaining the origins of a phenomenon doesn\u2019t give us the kind\nof explanation which philosophers are concerned with (Vrahimis 2020).\nHowever, the idea of reasons in aesthetics itself deserves critical\ninterrogation, given the evidence that the reasons people give seem\noften to be confabulations and that focusing on reasons while making a\njudgement can make you a worse judge rather than a better one (see\nIrvin 2014 and Lopes 2014, mentioned above,\n Section 1).\n Nor is the problem here confined to the aesthetic domain: Hugo\nMercier and Dan Sperber (2017) argue that, quite generally, reasoning\nworks well as an instrument of public debate but poorly as a guide to\npersonal judgement and decision.\n4. Art, Empathy and Neuroaesthetics\n\nGerman aesthetics of the late nineteenth century was particularly\nfocused on explaining human attraction to form in picturing, sculpture\nand building. Not always easy to interpret in detail, the broader\nthemes of this work include the ways that our bodily and ecological\nsituation determine the aesthetic preferences we have for such things\nas symmetry (W\u00f6lfflin 1886), how architectural form is\nappreciated in terms of its capacity to facilitate movement through\nspace (Schmarsow 1894, and how a sense of beauty arises from our\nprojecting the feelings provoked by an external object into that\nobject (Lipps 1903, see Currie 2011 for discussion). After a long\nperiod of neglect, these and related topics have reappeared under the\nbanner \u201cembodied cognition.\u201d Freedberg and Gallese (2007)\nhave drawn attention to the ways our bodies tend to reproduce the\nposture of a statue, to produce implicit or simulated movements that\nmirror those that seems to have produced a brush stroke or chisel\nmark, to resonate sympathetically with the pain of a represented\nfigure. These, they say, are intrinsic aspects of aesthetic experience\nneglected by theorists who emphasise an intellectualist approach to\nart. They also claim that evidence for these effects based on\nintrospective reports can now be supplemented by an empirically\nverified theory of brain processing that appeals to mirror and\ncanonical neurons. Critics have alleged that this approach neglects\nthe aesthetic impact of top-down factors (Kesner &\nHor\u00e1\u010dek 2017) and that motor responses are absent in many\nencounters with art (Casati & Pignocchi 2007: 410). Arguably\nthough, Freedberg and Gallese seek only to identify an aesthetic\nfactor of some significance and need not claim either exclusiveness or\nuniversality for it. Formalists in art might object even to this\nrestricted claim, arguing that what Freedberg and Gallese have\nidentified are obstructions to the sort of \u201cpurely\noptical\u201d attention to pictures that Greenberg (1960) advocated\n(on which see Steinberg 1965; Currie 2007). But here again aesthetic\nprescription cannot afford to ignore empirical work: standards of\naesthetic attention that no one has ever lived up to are not to be\ntaken seriously.\n\nAttempting to illuminate aesthetic phenomena by appeal to mirror\nneurons and other neurological processes is now so common that we have\na substantial genre of neuroaesthetic writings (see\nChatterjee 2013 for the field\u2019s growth over 30 years). What\nremains controversial, though, is the significance (if any) this\nresearch into brain structures and processes has for aesthetics. We\nhave already seen that\u2014despite the bold claims sometimes made by\nneuro-aestheticians\u2014some critics are inclined to dismiss this\nkind of work as irrelevant to evaluating the kinds of claim which\naestheticians are concerned with. Gallese and Freedberg, responding to\ncritics, say that\n\n\nno esthetic judgment is possible without [\u2026] mirroring\nmechanisms in the forms of simulated embodiment and empathetic\nengagement that follow upon visual observation. (2007: 411)\n\n\nBut to understand the aesthetic significance of facts about such\nmechanisms we need to distinguish between two claims:\n\nEvidential claim: facts about mechanisms may provide evidence to\nsupport or undermine a claim about what is involved in aesthetic\nexperience or judgement.\nConstitutive claim: facts about mechanisms may be constitutive\nparts of the story we tell about what is involved in aesthetic\nexperience or judgement.\n\n\nThe evidential claim is more plausible than the constitutive claim.\nConsider first the evidential relevance of cognitive and neurological\nmechanisms for aesthetics. We have just now referred to a dispute\nabout how much of our experience of visual art depends on a\nwork\u2019s tendency to encourage bodily empathy with what is\ndepicted. While people sometimes report experiences of these kinds it\nmay be that they vary in accessibility, with some unnoticed without\nhigh levels of attention, though still making a contribution to our\noverall liking for/valuing of the work. Studies of brain activity\nacross a range of artistic stimuli might suggest that these empathic\nresponses are very common indeed\u2014or that they are relatively\nunusual\u2014because (let us suppose) empathy has an identifiable\nneurological signature. Such studies would be useful as evidence for\nthe claim that something needs to be factored in to an account of\naesthetic experience. But the relevant something would be the empathic\nresponse, not the brain process (See Carroll, Moore, & Seeley\n2012: 54 where studies of this kind are described as\n\u201cdata\u201d for aesthetic theories).\n\nThe difference between aesthetic effects and the mechanisms that\nrealise them is an important one. Take the shimmering quality we find\nin impressionist art. It is said that this depends on the fact that\nthe visual system involves two separate processing streams and that\ncertain colour combinations are processed exclusively by one of them\n(Livingstone 2002). Should this fact, if it is one, be regarded as an\naesthetic fact? Arguably no. What matters aesthetically is the\nexperienced shimmering quality; a world in which just that shimmering\nquality was produced by some other mechanism of perceptual processing\nwould not be aesthetically different from our world, at least in this\nrespect. The same applies to scientific studies of the stimuli\nthemselves; chemical analysis of an ancient pigment might show that it\nwas a hard medium to work in, and that would be relevant to\nunderstanding the works of art produced by its means. But what matters\nis the difficulty of the medium; discovering its chemical formula\nsimply provides evidence for that.\n5. Authenticity\n\nA Kant-inspired view of long standing is that aesthetics is concerned\nnot with how things are but with how they appear (e.g., Urmson 1957),\na view sometimes called aesthetic empiricism (Currie 1989) On\nthis view aesthetics takes no cognisance of authenticity, which\ndepends on history and not on appearance; a fake Vermeer does not\nbecome authentic by being visually indistinguishable from a genuine\none. Is an object\u2019s history really aesthetically irrelevant?\nThose with an interest in art, craft and the design of artefacts\ngenerally are much concerned with the object\u2019s history, and\nthere are arguments to support the view that the application of at\nleast some aesthetic properties depends on assumptions about that\nhistory. Consider two such attributions from Sibley\u2019s (1959)\nextensive list of aesthetic properties: being delicate and\nbeing dynamic. A line that is seen as delicate when thought\nto be drawn by hand may not seem so when revealed as the product of a\nmachine, and Walton (1970) argued that, of two works which are\nvisually indistinguishable, one may be fairly described as dynamic and\nthe other not, depending on differences in their category membership\n(for defences of aesthetic empiricism concerning visual art see\nZanwill and, on music, Dodd; for the aesthetic relevance of\ngenuineness or authenticity see Korsmeyer 2019). The suggestion of at\nleast the first of these examples (being delicate) is that\nthe aesthetic properties of a thing, and the aesthetic values that\npossession of these properties entails, depend on the kind of\nachievement that the fashioning of the work represents. What may be a\nconsiderable achievement for one person at one time may be a greater,\nlesser or at least a different achievement for someone else, working\nwith different materials or in a distinct artistic culture (Dutton\n1979; Currie 1989; Huddleston 2012; Levinson 2016); James Grant (2020)\nsuggests that we do better to think in terms of a work\u2019s\ncapacity to exhibit the skills of its maker rathen than in terms of\nits constituting an achievement of the maker (see also Currie\n2018).\n\nBoth formulations imply a close connection between valuing the work\nand valuing the maker, helping thereby to explain how an interest in\nthe authenticity of a work can belong to the space of aesthetic\nreasons. It also suggests a connection with our desire to preserve and\npossess otherwise unremarkable objects because of their relation to\nsome person or event that interests us (JFK\u2019s sweater). Some\npsychologists have thought to bring art works and other valued\nartefacts together under the heading of contagion, the idea that\n\n\na person\u2019s immaterial qualities or \u2018essence\u2019 can be\ntransferred to an object through physical contact; (Newman,\nDiesendruck, & Bloom 2011)\n\n\nan idea that goes back to early anthropological work by Frazer (1890\n[1994]) and others. As the examples just given indicate, the idea that\na person\u2019s essence is transferable to an object does not depend\non the object\u2019s aesthetic merits, and this severely limits the\nusefulness of this idea in explaining the role of authenticity in the\narts (see, however, Korsmeyer 2019 where it is argued that genuineness\nis itself an aesthetic property). Bloom and colleagues stress the role\nof physical contact in the contagion process: \u201cAn original\nPicasso may be valuable because Picasso actually touched it\u201d\n(Newman & Bloom 2012: 3). But Picasso may have got no closer than\na brush length from Guernica, a picture likely to command\nhigher art-world respect (and higher prices) than a restaurant napkin\nsketch he then wiped his hands on. However, a more general and perhaps\nrather vague sense of \u201ccloseness\u201d to the artist and their\nact of making does seem to be explanatory of some art-world practices,\nsuch as a preference for lower numbered (and hence earlier) prints\neven where there is no decline in quality across later ones (Smith,\nNewman, & Dhar 2016).\n\nBloom and colleagues offer another explanation for our interest in\nauthentic items, this one closer in spirit to the suggestion above\nthat aesthetic judgements are sensitive to achievement or the\nmanifestation of ability:\n\n\n[A]n original is different from a forgery because it is the end point\nof a different sort of performance . The original is a creative work\nwhile the forgery is not. (Newman & Bloom 2012: 559)\n\n\nGuernica, very likely, is a more creative work than the napkin sketch\nand plausibly valued more for that reason. A question which arises is\nthis: how do people make judgements of the quality of, say, a\npainting, if not solely on the basis of how it looks? For a few highly\ntrained experts the answer may be: through deep immersion in the\ncultural and artistic context of the work. The rest of us, where we\nmake a judgement at all, may be dependent on short cuts such as the\n\u201ceffort heuristic\u201d, which treats evidence of effort as\nevidence of quality. In an experiment, people asked to judge the\nrelative merits of pictures A and B tended to judge\nA as better than B when told A took longer\nto paint, while the group who were told that B took longer\npreferred B. This effect was found equally among experts and\namong laypersons, though the experts were \u201cself-described\u201d\n(Kruger et al. 2004).\n6. Pictures, Imagination and Perception\n\nWollheim (1980) said that what is distinctive about pictorial\nrepresentation is its capacity to generate a certain kind of\nexperience: the experience of \u201cseeing the subject in the\npicture\u201d. For many this has seemed to capture something deeply\nimportant about the nature of depictive representation, though\nWollheim\u2019s specific claims about it are disputed. What exactly\nis seeing-in? One subsequent suggestion has been that we see\nsomething, X, in a picture when we experience a resemblance\nbetween the outline shape visible in the picture and the outline shape\nthat would be presented from that same perspective by X\n(Hopkins 1998; for a related proposal see Peacocke 1987). Another\nproposal is that we see X in a picture when we are prompted\nby it to imagine, of our act of seeing the picture, that it is a\nseeing of X (Walton 1992). Is cognitive science able to help\nus adjudicate between rival theories in this area? It does look as if\nthese ostensibly philosophical theories are committing themselves, if\nsomewhat vaguely, on empirical issues. Surely, we cannot settle from\nthe armchair whether the perception of pictures draws on imaginative\ncapacities. Scientists have gone a long way towards locating areas of\nthe brain implicated in certain kinds of functions, emotion and the\nforms of perception being good examples. But we are not similarly able\nto localise imaginative activity and there may be an in-principle\nbarrier to our doing so; there is some reason to suppose that there\nare not dedicated mechanisms of imaginative activity, but that\nimagining involves the reuse of systems designed for other purposes.\nThis issue has been a central contention in the debate over how we\nunderstand the minds of other people, a debate originally drawn in\nterms of two opposing outlooks, theory-theory and simulation theory,\nthough other approaches have come into view (Gallagher & Hutto\n2008). Theory-theory attributes to us a (perhaps tacit) theory of the\nmental states of others, their connection to action and so forth, from\nwhich we derive predictions and explanations of behaviour (Fodor 1992;\nCarruthers 1996). Simulationism, by contrast, argues that we have a\ncapacity to use our own mental systems of inferring and deciding to\nmodel or simulate the thoughts and decisions of others (Gordon 1986).\nWhile Heal has emphasised what she takes to be the a priori\nprinciple that when we examine the thinking of another person we have\nto reproduce in our own minds the contents of and the logical\nrelations between the propositions thought (1986), others have\ndeveloped an empirically oriented version, postulating causal\nmechanisms by which practical and theoretical reasoning can be taken\n\u201coff-line\u201d, or disconnected from experiential inputs and\nbehavioural outputs (A. I. Goldman 1989). It has been suggested that\nthe simulation approach, understood largely in this empirically\noriented way, enables us to explain a good deal about our interest in\nand responses to fiction (Currie & Ravenscroft 2002). Questions\nabout causally effective mental architecture have played a role in\nother aesthetic debates such as the explanation of our capacity to\nbecome immersed in a narrative (Schellenberg 2013) and of the contrary\ntendency to \u201cresist\u201d imaginative involvement with stories\nwe perceive as morally or in other ways problematic (Weinberg &\nMeskin 2006; Miyazono & Liao 2016).\n\nWhile some of these ideas come with a detailed \u201cboxology\u201d\nthat describes the cognitive implementation of the proposal, they are\ngenerally the product of work at the more philosophical and\nspeculative end of inquiry into the architecture of mind where\nevidence is at best very indirect. An exception is the suggestion that\nthere is empirical confirmation for Wollheim\u2019s (1998) notion of\ntwofoldness in picture perception, according to which spectators are\nsimultaneously aware of both the surface qualities of the picture and\nthe depicted content. In particular, it has been argued that\n\n\nthe twofold experience of pictures Wollheim talks about corresponds to\nthe dichotomy between our dorsal visual processing of the surface of\nthe picture and our ventral visual processing of the depicted scene.\n(Nanay 2011: 464)\n\n\nSupport for this idea comes from evidence that people with damage to\ntheir ventral processing often have difficulty deciphering the content\nof a picture without corresponding difficulty in perceiving the\nordinary properties of the surface of the picture (Turnbull, Driver,\n& McCarthy 2004). This illustrates another way that the\ninvestigation of mechanisms may further aesthetic inquiry. An\naesthetic phenomenon\u2014in this case twofoldness\u2014is\npostulated and the question arises as to whether there is a plausible\nstory about how this is implemented. If no such story were available,\ndoubt would be thrown on the claim.\n7. Emotion\n\nA good deal of aesthetic thinking has been taken up with arguing about\nthe limits to its capacity to appeal to the emotions. Two issues are\nparticularly notable, one descriptive and the other, in part,\nnormative. What, first of all, are the facts about our (apparently)\nemotional responses to fictions? Do we really admire, despise or pity\npeople we know do not exist? This sounds like an empirical question,\nperhaps one to be resolved by studies of the brains of people engaged\nby fictional work. But the prospects for this approach are poor, and\nnot only because of practical difficulties in data gathering (see Cova\n& Teroni 2016). Those who deny that we pity Anna Karenina do no\ndeny that readers may display all the physiological signs that go with\nthat emotion. What they claim is that genuine fear has a cognitive\ncomponent lacking in this case: belief in the object of one\u2019s\nfear. Suppose we could show empirically that readers of Tolstoy do\nexperience all the pity-relevant physiological states while failing to\nbelieve in the existence of Anna Karenina, having instead cognitive\nstates such as \u201cimagining that Anna exists\u201d. The\nphilosophical problem would remain: are people with that psychological\nprofile genuinely in a state of pitying, or is their state merely one\nof what Walton (1978) calls \u201cquasi-pity\u201d, which involves\nthe typical physiological and psychological reactions of pity but\nwhich falls short of being full-fledged pity because it does not go\nwith belief in its objects, or with the typical corresponding\ndispositions to action? We might at this point wonder whether what\nlooked like a substantive question about fear and pity has been shown\nto be merely one about labelling. However, there are empirical\nconsiderations that bear indirectly on the issue. Gendler and\nKovackovick suggest that plausible assumptions about the evolutionary\nproper function of the emotions tells against the idea that fear\nrequires belief. It is likely on Darwinian grounds that our emotions\nwere shaped not merely by their capacity to have us avoid present\ndangers, but also to have us avoid merely possible ones. Imagining a\ndangerous creature lurking in the forest may be enough to send me by a\nsafer route, raising my chances of surviving and passing on my genes.\nIf imagined dangers are part of the reason fear has been selected for\nand retained why insist that responses to the imagined creatures and\nevents of fiction are, as Walton (1978) claims, merely quasi-fears?\nFor other connections between aesthetics and evolutionary thinking see\nbelow,\n Section 9.\n\nA similar problem arises when we consider our responses to music. We\nsometimes talk of sad music making us sad, though the music does not\nprovide us with any reason for thinking that something sad has\nhappened (sad music sometimes reminds us of a sad event, but this is\nnot a general feature of cases where sad music affects us). Here\nappeal to the imagination seems less helpful; unlike fictional\nnarratives, emotionally affecting music does not usually provide us\nwith the materials for imagining some sad event. Kivy has argued that\nsadness on the part of those who listen to sad music is, where it\noccurs, irrelevant to musical appreciation and will indeed not occur\nin episodes of listening which instantiate his preferred model of\nmusical listening, one which requires exclusive attention to the\nstructural, phenomenological, and expressive properties of the music\n(1990: ch. 8). Kivy does not deny however that musical listening can\nand indeed should be a deeply emotional experience; we may be\noverwhelmed by the compositional and performance qualities the work\nrepresents. Some attempt has been made to challenge Kivy on empirical\ngrounds by presenting evidence that music does reliable engender the\nemotions or moods it expresses (Sizer 2007). But Kivy denied this\npossibility only for the case of canonical music listening, and says\nthat there is no reason to think that subjects in the relevant\nexperiments were listening in that canonical way (2007). Certainly it\nwould not be easy to control experimental conditions so as to rule-out\nlistening which is non-canonical in Kivy\u2019s sense (see also Kivy\n2006; Carroll 2003; Carroll & Moore 2007). However, if\nexperimental tests do consistently provide evidence of\nemotion-generation concordant with the emotions expressed by the\nmusic, it will not do simply to say that we have not yet tested the\nright listeners. The friend of Kivy will have to find robust instances\nof the sort of listening he approves of, and not depend merely on the\npersonal testimony of those who favour his theory. We take it, after\nall, that Kivy\u2019s ideal mode of listening is presented as a\npractically achievable goal. Zangwill 2004 represents a formalism that\nis less willing to accommodate the emotions; for a more limited\ndefence of the formalist position see Cochrane 2021b.\n\nAnother aesthetically important question about the emotions is this:\nwhy are we attracted to representations and other devices that\ngenerate negative emotions such as sorrow and fear? It is not a\nsatisfactory answer to this question to make the suggestion referred\nto above that we do not really fear Dracula and other creatures of\nfiction but merely quasi-fear them, because fear and quasi-fear are\nsupposed to be qualitatively the same, so if fear is unpleasant\nquasi-fear is also. The question can be asked about both narrative\nworks and about music; recall that even Kivy grants that\n(non-canonical) musical listening may generate sadness. However,\nfiction has been the greater part of this discussion, and will be here\nalso. On this issue philosophers have tended to take one of three\npositions (but see Smuts 2009 for a wider range of options):\n\nCompensation: audiences tolerate the negative emotions of tragedy,\nhorror and other genres because they recognise compensatory benefits\n(Carroll 1990; Feagin 1983)\nConversion: emotions which would otherwise be experienced as\nunpleasant are experienced as positive in artistic contexts (Hume 1757\n[1987]).\nNeutrality: it is wrong to think that the so called\n\u201cnegative emotions\u201d provoked by tragedy or horror are\nintrinsically unpleasant and hence in need of compensation or\nconversion. They are not intrinsically valenced and may be experienced\nnegatively in some situations and positively in others (Gaut 1993;\nWalton 1990: 255\u20138)\n\n\nNeutrality is a general claim about the emotions and relevant here as\none way to argue in favour of conversion. But a conversion theorists\nneed not be committed to Neutrality. We focus here on the contrast\nbetween Compensation and Conversion. Compensation, unlike Conversion,\nappeals to a type of psychological process that is hardly\ncontroversial; we accept many kinds of unpleasant experiences because\navoiding them will have even less desirable consequences. Conversion\nsounds more problematic: how can an emotion \u201cflip\u201d its\nhedonic value and still be the same emotion? Psychologists interested\nin negative emotions in art have cited research which purports to\nreveal hedonic flip for pain: subjects who expected an intense pain\nbut experienced only a moderately painful stimulus described the\nexperience as \u201cpleasant\u201d, while subjects expecting\nnonpainful warmth described the same stimulus as unpleasant (Leknes et\nal. 2013). This doesn\u2019t by itself show that the same thing can\nhappen in the case of tragedy or horror, but it suggests that the\nconversion claim is less outlandish than it might initially seem.\n\nWhile compensation may appeal to a familiar kind of trade off, it\nneeds to tell us what specific compensatory benefits are to be had\nfrom the negative emotions provoked by art. Philosophers have long\ncited epistemic benefits: the distressing events of tragedy are a\nsource of moral and psychological learning, sometimes about ourselves\n(Collingwood 1938; Schier 1983). Empirical scientists have added to\nthe list: painful emotions generate strong pro-social feelings that\nhelp to unite us with both characters and authors (Bastian, Pe, &\nKuppens 2017; Egloff 2017).\n\nWhile philosophers have long offered theories to resolve this\n\u201cparadox of tragedy,\u201d only one substantial study of it\nclaims to be grounded in empirical research. Menninghaus and\ncolleagues propose what they call the \u201cthe Distancing-Embracing\nmodel\u201d (Menninghaus, Wagner, Hanich, et al. 2017) according to\nwhich an aesthetic context, as with watching a play or film, distances\nus from the situation represented and allows the positive effects of\ntragic emotions, notably their capacity to focus attention, to sustain\nthem. While a large and relevant body of empirical work is called on\nin support of the idea, its theoretical commitments are unclear. In\nsome of their formulations the function of distancing seems to be the\nreduction in unpleasantness of negative emotions to the point where\nthey are \u201cnot inevitably incompatible with art-specific\nexpectations of hedonic reward\u201d (2017: 6); this leaves them open\nto the charge made against compensation theories that the work\u2019s\nbeing apt to generate negative emotions seems to be a major factor in\nattracting people to the work, rather than something negative we can\nbe persuaded to live with. In other formulations they speak of the\nfactors \u201cinvolved in making negative emotions enjoyable\u201d\n(2017: 3), which suggests the conversion theory. Yet they claim that\ntheir theory is a version of neither of these approaches (2017: 15;\nsee S. Davies 1997). (For more on the relationship between fiction and\nemotion see the supplement to Liao & Gendler 2018 [2020]). See\nbelow,\n Section 7\n for further remarks on fiction and emotion.\n\nTo conclude the discussion of fiction, we note another direct appeal\nto work at the empirical level. Derek Matravers (2014) argues that it\nhas been a mistake of recent theorising about fiction to appeal to the\nimagination. Matravers claims that work on mental models does a good\njob of explaining our processing and comprehension of, and responses\nto, both fictional and nonfictional narratives without any need to\ndistinguish fictional cases by their connection with the\nimagination.\n8. The Aesthetics of Literature and Literary Language\n\nThrough the latter part of the twentieth century, theoretical and\ninterpretive studies of literature have been somewhat hostile to both\ncognitive and aesthetic inquiry, often thought of as irrelevant to\nserious interpretive work and a distraction from favoured political\nagendas. Cognitive studies of literature have developed somewhat in\nthe last twenty years but remain a minority enterprise (Hartner 2017).\nOne question of long standing that has concerned scholars in\npsychology, literary studies and aesthetics is the idea that we learn\nfrom literature about the world beyond the text, an idea treated with\nsome suspicion by those influenced by deconstructive or post-modern\ntheorising, who argue that such ambitions depend on failing to realise\nthat characters of fiction are not, and are not like, real people\n(Cixous 1974). Others argue that such cognitive benefits, if they\nexist, are not aesthetically relevant (Lamarque & Olsen 1994: ch.\n17; for criticism see Gaut 2007: ch. 7; Currie 2020: \u00a79.6). There\nis, however, a strong tendency to suppose that the artistic merit of,\nsay, a Shakespearean drama depends in part on our sense that it is\nrevelatory of deep insights into the human condition. Similar claims\nare made for other arts; contemplating van Gogh\u2019s lithograph\nSorrow Kendall Walton notes responding imaginatively to the\nwoman in ways that \u201cgain for me an understanding of what a\nparticular sorrow is like\u201d (2008: 78).\n\nRecently efforts have been made to test the idea that literature does,\non occasion, provide cognitive benefits. It has been claimed that\nexposure to fiction\u2014even single episodes of\nreading\u2014measurably improves empathy and theory of mind (Kidd\n& Castano 2013); the effects, if real, seem to be small and the\nclaimed results have been hard to replicate (Panero et al. 2016; Kidd\n& Castano 2019). Other work in this growing field also does not\npoint in a single direction. Some studies suggest that fiction has a\ncapacity to improve aspects of social cognition (Calarco et al. 2017;\nMar 2018a,b) while others find no such effect (e.g., Wimmer et al.\n2021a, b; see Currie 2020; chs 9\u201311 for general discussion).\nHumanistic scholars who claim educative effects for fiction may\nrespond that these effects are slow and cumulative, and unlikely to be\nvisible in studies of single episodes of reading; testing such claims\nwill be difficult. But their claims are, nonetheless, empirical.\n\nAmong other examples of the cognitive study of literature are\ninvestigations of emotional responses. While aestheticians have tended\nto focus on the apparently \u201cparadoxical\u201d aspects of our\nemotional responses to fictions (for example why we are emotionally\naffected by the non-existent, see above\n Section 7),\n researchers in the cognitive sciences has begun a broader attempt to\nunderstand the role of emotions of all kinds in generating and\nmaintaining interest in narrative and poetry (Menninghaus, Wagner,\nWassiliwizky, et al. 2017); Jenefer Robinson\u2019s (2005) is an\nexample of work from within aesthetics that takes up this broader\nambition while being strongly informed by empirical work. More\nrecently, Kukkonen (2020) attempts an alignment between the\nexpectations of a reader sometimes surprised by plot development and\nthe predictive processing approach to perception and cognition (see\nabove\n Section 3).\n It is an open question whether the predictive processing account\nsheds aesthetically relevant light on the reader\u2019s experience\nrather than simply providing an account of the mechanisms involved\n(see above\n Section 4).\n\nA striking example of an area long thought of as resistant to theory\nfrom outside the domain of art and the aesthetic is that of literary\nlanguage. Insight into the kind of language we think of as distinctive\nof poetry, drama and the novel has traditionally been sought from\nthose whose expertise is literature itself rather than from those\ndeveloping general theories of communication, a view endorsed by Peter\nLamarque, who regards the idea that there is value in seeing literary\nworks as akin to quotidian genres of utterance such as letter-writing\nor political speech making as \u201cutterly misconceived\u201d\n(Lamarque 2007: 34). But advocates of relevance theory, a\nnaturalistically inclined development of Gricean pragmatics, reject\nthe idea that there is anything fundamentally special or autonomous\nabout literary language, claiming that\n\n\nstylistic and poetic effects traditionally associated with figurative\nutterances arise naturally in the pursuit of relevance, and call for\nno special treatment not required for the interpretation of ordinary\nliteral utterances. (D. Wilson 2018: 191)\n\n\n(for work that seeks empirical confirmation for relevance theory see,\ne.g., Happe 1993; Sperber & Wilson 2002; van der Henst, Carles,\n& Sperber 2002; Noveck & Posada 2003; and van der Henst &\nSperber 2004).\n\nOne ambition of relevance theory is to encourage us to see\n\u201cpoetic uses\u201d of language, where an idea is very\nindirectly suggested by the words used, as less marginal than we would\nif we thought of the paradigm of communication as the case where an\nagent utters a sentence that means exactly what the speaker wishes to\ncommunicate. Relevance theorists say that such cases of literal\nmeaning are rare or non-existent and do not constitute any kind of\ncommunicative ideal. They point to the widespread phenomenon of\n\u201cweak implicature\u201d: audiences draw a range of conclusions\nfrom an utterance, some of them obviously intended but others harder\nto identify as intended (Sperber & Wilson 1995: 197\u20139). On\nthis view the totality of what is meant, even in mundane cases, is\nnever more than vaguely specifiable and would, if we bothered to\ninvestigate, be subject to the same unresolvable disputes as we find\nin poetic criticism. It need not be concluded that poetic discourse is\nentirely of a piece with over-the-garden-wall conversation; the\nrelevance theorist\u2019s point is that the differences are ones of\ndegree and not of kind.\n9. Aesthetics and Evolution\n\nTheories of human evolution over the last two million years are\nseverely limited by the very incomplete fossil record and the fact\nthat soft tissue disappears quickly. Given these constraints it is\nsurprising the extent to which cognitive theorising has reached into\nthe very distant past, though its claims are agreed on all hands to be\nhighly provisional. A vital resource has been the study of stone\nartefacts going back two million years or more, artefacts which\npreserve very well and which are available in great quantities. We are\nable to reconstruct a good deal about the methods of their\nconstruction and to speculate in a reasonably informed way on the\ncognitive capacities they require. Based on these speculations\ninnovations in stone tool manufacture have been linked to the\ndevelopment of language (Higuchi et. al. 2009).\n\nAny topic on which aesthetic and evolutionary methods converge is\nlikely to be approached with two questions in mind.\n\nIs the emergence and development of art-making and related\nactivities explainable wholly or very largely in cultural terms, or is\nthere a substantial biological component?\nIs art-making an adaptation or a non-adaptive consequence of\ndevelopments which may themselves have adaptive advantages (or\nsomething else)?\n\n\nIt might be thought that the second question arises only if one\nanswers the first in a way that gives an important explanatory role to\nbiology. But culturally determined \u201cphenotypes\u201d can also\nbe adaptive, maladaptive or neutral. Cooking, certainly a cultural\ninnovation, is highly adaptive and has led to significant change in\ngut size and perhaps in brain size as well (Godfrey-Smith 2013; for\nscepticism concerning the relation to brain size see Corn\u00e9lio\net al. 2016). Human biological and cultural evolution are closely\nconnected.\n\nOn the question whether there is a role for biological explanation\nwhen it comes to human aesthetic activity, there is a constituency of\nscholars hostile to this idea; they argue that \u201cart\u201d and\n\u201caesthetic\u201d are notions of recent and essentially western\ninvention, the application of which to other and older cultures is\nmistaken (Gell 1998: 97). Opponents of this view readily grant the\nhuge cultural variability of aesthetic activity. They argue that there\nare enough commonalities between the ways very different cultures\ninvest in the shaping and decoration of objects, in music, dance and\nin story-telling to make it plausible that biology provides both the\ninitial impetus to and a set of constraints on these activities\n(Dutton 2009; Currie 2012). If we thought, as we once did, that these\nactivities could be traced no further back than the cave depictions of\nthe European Upper Paleolithic it would be likely that the aesthetic\nis too late-emerging to have a biological basis. Very recent\ndiscoveries have now suggested a somewhat earlier origin; depictions\nin Indonesia have been given dates prior to 45,000 years ago (Brumm et\nal. 2021). More dramatically, though, the temporal depth of aesthetic\nactivity is vastly increased if we turn our attention to the stone\ntools mentioned above, many of which show a notable symmetry of\nconstruction. Hand axes from the Acheulean industry which arose about\n1.7 million years ago are sometimes too large, small or sharply\npointed to be practical implements and strongly suggest an interest in\nthe display of skilful making that we commonly recognise in, say, the\nart of the European renaissance (see Currie & Zhu 2021 and Gowlett\n2021, both of which in different ways emphasise the importance of\nseeing aesthetic practices emerging in a social context). Some have\nseen these elaborated instruments as products of sexual selection, as\npeacock\u2019s tails are said to be: reliable indicators of the\nmaker\u2019s qualities as a mate (Kohn & Mithen 1999). Another\nview has it that they were indicators of trustworthiness, and hence of\none\u2019s value as a co-operator (Spikins 2012); for criticism of\nboth views see Hiscock 2014.\n\nHand axes are unlike a peacock\u2019s tail in being detached from the\nbody and so may be passed from one person to another\u2014one reason\nto doubt their reliability as signals of any particular agent\u2019s\nsuitability as a mate. Where symmetry of the body itself is at issue\nthat objection does not apply, and bodily and especially facial\nsymmetry has been offered as an example of something evolution has\ntuned our sensibilities to because it is an indicator of health in a\nreproductive partner. However, robust evidence has been hard to find.\nOne recent study did \u201cnot support the idea that facial symmetry\nacts as a reliable cue to physiological health\u201d (Pound et al.\n2014; see also Kalick et al. 1998), another that there is\n\u201clittle evidence that female appearance predicted health\u201d\n(Foo et al. 2017; this study did support a connection between male\nfacial appearance and fertility). For ethical arguments, supported by\nempirical findings, that we should rethink our standard approach to\nthe aesthetics of human appearances, see Irvin 2017.\n\nIt should be noted that even a very early dating of the emergence of\naesthetic interests does not establish that they have a biological\norigin; the Acheulean period seems to have been marked by high levels\nof planning and organisation that suggest strong social relations\n(Hiscock 2014). In this sense aesthetic activity may be a culturally\nderived \u201ctechnology\u201d, as writing is, rather than an\nadaptation, as language may be (S. Davies 2012: ch. 10). Could we\naccount, on that hypothesis, for the seeming ease with which young\nchildren take to forms of aesthetic activity such as drawing and\nsinging? By contrast, learning to write is effortful and requires\ngreat investment in pedagogy. Recent work (Heyes 2021) seeks to\nreshape our assumptions about what is learned, arguing that such an\nearly and reliably developing ability as interpersonal understanding\nis really a socially acquired \u201cgadget\u201d (Heyes & Frith\n2014). To add to a complex menu of options we also note that what\nbegins as a gadget or technology might, under certain circumstances\nfall under complete or partial genetic control. This so-called\n\u201cBaldwin effect\u201d, once despised in evolutionary thinking,\nhas attracted interest more recently (Weber & Depew 2003). It\nproposes a mechanism by which acquired characteristics can become\nbiologically heritable, without giving any ground to the Lamarkian\nidea that changes that accrue in an organism\u2019s lifetime can be\npassed directly to the next generation. For example, if advantages\nflow from learning a skill, there may be selective pressure to ease\nthe burden and uncertainty of learning by making the skill, or some of\nits components, innate (Papineau 2005). Given the multiply crossing\npaths between cultural and biological evolution there is little\ndefinite to be said about the origins of aesthetic interests other\nthan that we see evidence for it in human populations more than half a\nmillion years ago.\n\nWe turn now to our second question: Is art-making an adaptation or a\nnon-adaptive consequence of developments which may themselves have\nadaptive advantages? Or something else entirely? Strong and contrary\nviews have been expressed on this question; some have argued that the\ndevelopment of depiction, story-telling and music have been crucial\nfor social bonding (Dissanayake 1992, 2000, 2017) or mate-choice\n(Miller 2000; Dutton 2009; for criticism see, e.g., C. Wilson 2016),\nothers say that the creation of aesthetic artefacts offers no adaptive\nadvantage but that they gained their hold on us because they provide\nrewards to sensory and other mechanisms in the mind that arose for\nquite other purposes (Pinker 1997). From a somewhat different\nperspective it is suggested that we do best by seeing human aesthetic\nactivity as simply the continuation of ubiquitous practices of\nsignalling and manipulation in the world of plants and animals. An\ninteresting feature of this idea is that it replaces the traditional\ndistinction between the aesthetics of artefacts and the aesthetics of\nnature with a distinction between, on the one hand artefacts\nand natural entities such as animal calls and flower\ncolouring, and on the other natural objects such as rocks, sunsets and\nthe night sky which \u201cdo not coevolve with sensory evaluations of\nthem\u201d (Prum 2013: 821; see also De Ti\u00e8ge, Verpooten,\n& Braeckman 2021). It is not clear whether we currently know\nenough to decide between the available alternatives (S. Davies 2012:\nch. 12; for the case of fiction, Currie 2020; \u00a77.4). But would\ndeciding whether art-making is adaptive advance the cause of aesthetic\ninquiry? That is doubtful. The question whether art is an adaptation\nconcerns whether the reason we have art now is that it contributed to\nthe fitness of our species. That could be true without it also being\ntrue that art now enriches our lives in any of the ways commonly\nclaimed\u2014giving pleasure, educating our emotions, instructing us\nabout morality. And it is possible that art does now have all those\nadvantages while having been an evolutionary irrelevance. It is also\ntrue that even if art was not originally adaptive, it might have\nbecome adaptive (an \u201cexaptation\u201d) at some stage and might\nbe adaptive now. Different answers may apply to different art forms.\nIt is said that the novel is a particularly appropriate means by which\nto exercise our capacities for empathy and mind reading (Nussbaum\n1990, 1995; Mar and Oatley 2008); perhaps these advantages did not\nappear until the eighteenth or nineteenth centuries. While questions\nabout art posed in evolutionary terms are certainly of scientific\ninterest, what matters to the aesthetician is more likely to be the\nvalues that art currently and historically exemplifies and the ways\nthose values are currently and historically responded to by us.\n10. The Aesthetics of the Environment\n\nWe have referred rather briefly to the aesthetics of the natural and\nhumanly constructed environment and we conclude with a brief selection\nof aesthetically and cognitively relevant work in this area. Much of\nthis discussion continues the evolutionary theme. Note that some of\nthis work relies for its evidence on people\u2019s responses to\npictures of environments rather than to the environments themselves,\nleaving it uncertain how much of the response is to the environment\nand how much to its representation.\n\nThe empirical study of environmental preferences has long been of\ninterest to planners, and largely represents the bottom-up mode of\ninquiry referred to above (see\n Section 2),\n as the aim is to discover what people in general like rather than to\nassess their likings against the normative constraints of connoisseurs\nand philosophers. Topics explored include the differences in\npreference across age groups, ethnicity, education and income (e.g.,\nKaplan & Talbot 1988). One conclusion often drawn is that there is\na widespread, perhaps universal, human preference for savanna\nlandscapes, even among communities whose own historically stable\nhabitat is very different, and that this preference is reflected in\nthe design of parks and gardens (Falk & Balling 2010). It is\nfurther asserted that this is the product of our evolutionary\ndevelopment in an East African context (E. O. Wilson 1975 is an early\nsource of this idea); for detailed discussion, references, and some\nreservations see S. Davies 2012: ch. 6.\n\nThe non-prescriptive nature of much empirical research into responses\nto the environment contrasts with a view influential in philosophical\naesthetics according to which there are quite demanding cognitive\nrequirements for a correct aesthetic appreciation of nature. The\nquestion mirrors one we have already discussed for the arts: what\nfactors, other than the sensory appearance of an object, are relevant\nto enjoying, appreciating and judging it aesthetically? In the case of\nthe arts we saw that one answer is to consider the work\u2019s\ncategory\u2014the (artistic) kind of thing it is (Walton 1970; see\nabove\n Section 5).\n Allen Carlson (2000) extends this idea to the aesthetics of nature,\narguing that a scene or object must be understood as belonging to a\nnatural kind, and as having the causal history characteristic of that\nkind; that is the right way to perceive it and aesthetic judgements\nabout it are correct only if they are tied to that category. This\nimplies that much human aesthetic experience of nature has been\nradically incorrect, being uninformed by the relevant scientific facts\nand often infused with notions of supernatural creation. Some will\nfind this an acceptable consequence; we are used to thinking that many\nlong-standing human ethical judgements have been radically mistaken,\nand aesthetic judgements might go the same way. Others however,\nquestion whether the aesthetic delight one takes in, say, a bird in\nflight depends for its acceptability on understanding the natural\nhistory of the creature (Budd 2001).\n\nA different and perhaps more accommodating approach to identifying\nwhat is distinctive in aesthetic appreciation of the environment\nconnects an older way of thinking with recent work on cognition. The\neighteenth century focused attention on notions of the sublime\n(notably Burke [1757], but in a line of thought from Longinus) and the\npicturesque (Gilpin 1782, with roots in the older concept of\npittoresco). These, particularly the former, have generated\ncontroversies about their relations to beauty\u2014are they\nsubspecies of beauty or categories distinct from it?\u2014and about\ntheir extensions\u2014is it only nature that can be sublime? The\nquestion also arises as to whether terms like \u201cthe\nsublime\u201d pick out a class of objects to which there is actually\na common aesthetic response. This sounds like something on which we\ncould get help from the cognitive sciences, and work by Keltner and\nHaight (2003), drawing on a range of empirical and reflective sources,\nhas been particularly noticed. Their work was on the concept of awe\nrather than the sublime but they note obvious connections, given the\nthought that the sublime involves a response to things physically or\nconceptually vast. They suggest that awe involves the recognition of\nthe apparent vastness of the object or scene attended to and the\ninability of the subject to assimilate it to their existing mental\nschemas. Other research suggests a strongly pan-cultural component in\nnonverbal expressions of this emotion (Keltner et al. 2019), and its\nassociation with a diminished sense of self (Piff et al. 2015; Tom\nCochrane (2012) has argued that the sublime is characterised by a\nfeeling of self-negation). It is suggested therefore that the\nexperience of the sublime is an aesthetic form of awe wherein the\nobject is attended to for its own sake (Clewis 2019; Arcangeli et al.\n2020), an idea elaborated by Shapsay (2021) who suggests that the\nsublime sometimes takes a cognitively elaborated form involving\nreflection of the challenge posed to existing schemata by the scene or\nobject one confronts.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Anderson, Judith L., Charles B.
