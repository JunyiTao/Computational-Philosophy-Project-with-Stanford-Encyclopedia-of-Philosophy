    "main_text": "Beyond analogical arguments || Analogy and confirmation\n5.1 Analogy and confirmation\n\nHow is analogical reasoning related to the confirmation of scientific\nhypotheses? The examples and philosophical discussion from earlier\nsections suggest that a good analogical argument can indeed provide\nsupport for a hypothesis. But there are good reasons to doubt the\nclaim that analogies provide actual confirmation.\n\nIn the first place, there is a logical difficulty. To appreciate this,\nlet us concentrate on confirmation as a relationship between\npropositions. Christensen (1999: 441) offers a helpful general\ncharacterization:\n\nSome propositions seem to help make it rational to believe other\npropositions. When our current confidence in \\(E\\) helps make rational\nour current confidence in \\(H\\), we say that \\(E\\) confirms \\(H\\).\n\nIn the Bayesian model, \u2018confidence\u2019 is represented in\nterms of subjective probability. A Bayesian agent starts with an\nassignment of subjective probabilities to a class of propositions.\nConfirmation is understood as a three-place relation:\n\n(11) \n Bayesian confirmation\n\n\\(E\\) confirms \\(H\\) relative to \\(K \\leftrightarrow Pr(H \\mid E \\cdot\nK) \\gt Pr(H \\mid K)\\). \n\n\n\\(E\\) represents a proposition about accepted evidence, \\(H\\) stands\nfor a hypothesis, \\(K\\) for background knowledge and \\(Pr\\) for the\nagent\u2019s subjective probability function. To confirm \\(H\\) is to\nraise its conditional probability, relative to \\(K\\). The shift from\nprior probability \\(Pr(H \\mid K)\\) to posterior\nprobability \\(Pr(H \\mid E \\cdot K)\\) is referred to as\nconditionalization on \\(E\\). The relation between these two\nprobabilities is typically given by Bayes\u2019 Theorem (setting\naside more complex forms of conditionalization): \n\n\\[\\tag{12}\nPr(H \\mid E \\cdot K) = \\frac{Pr(H \\mid K) Pr(E \\mid H \\cdot K)}{Pr(E \\mid K)}\n\\]\n\n\nFor Bayesians, here is the logical difficulty: it seems that an\nanalogical argument cannot provide confirmation. In the first place,\nit is not clear that we can encapsulate the information contained in\nan analogical argument in a single proposition, \\(E\\). Second, even if\nwe can formulate a proposition \\(E\\) that expresses that information,\nit is typically not appropriate to treat it as evidence because the\ninformation contained in \\(E\\) is already part of the\nbackground, \\(K\\). This means that \\(E \\cdot K\\) is equivalent to\n\\(K\\), and hence \\(Pr(H \\mid E \\cdot K) = Pr(H \\mid K)\\). According to\nthe Bayesian definition, we don\u2019t have confirmation. (This is a\nversion of the problem of old evidence; see\n confirmation.)\n Third, and perhaps most important, analogical arguments are often\napplied to novel hypotheses \\(H\\) for which the prior probability\n\\(Pr(H \\mid K)\\) is not even defined. Again, the definition of\nconfirmation in terms of Bayesian conditionalization seems\ninapplicable.\n\nIf analogies don\u2019t provide inductive support via ordinary\nconditionalization, is there an alternative? Here we face a second\ndifficulty, once again most easily stated within a Bayesian framework.\nVan Fraassen (1989) has a well-known objection to any belief-updating\nrule other than conditionalization. This objection applies to any rule\nthat allows us to boost credences when there is no new evidence. The\ncriticism, made vivid by the tale of Bayesian Peter, is that these\n\u2018ampliative\u2019 rules are vulnerable to a\n Dutch Book.\n Adopting any such rule would lead us to acknowledge as fair a system\nof bets that foreseeably leads to certain loss. Any rule of this type\nfor analogical reasoning appears to be vulnerable to van\nFraassen\u2019s objection.\n\nThere appear to be at least three routes to avoiding these\ndifficulties and finding a role for analogical arguments within\nBayesian epistemology. First, there is what we might call minimal\nBayesianism. Within the Bayesian framework, some writers\n(Jeffreys 1973; Salmon 1967, 1990; Shimony 1970) have argued that a\n\u2018seriously proposed\u2019 hypothesis must have a sufficiently\nhigh prior probability to allow it to become preferred as the result\nof observation. Salmon has suggested that analogical reasoning is one\nof the most important means of showing that a hypothesis is\n\u2018serious\u2019 in this sense. If analogical reasoning is\ndirected primarily towards prior probability assignments, it\ncan provide inductive support while remaining formally distinct from\nconfirmation, avoiding the logical difficulties noted above. This\napproach is minimally Bayesian because it provides nothing more than\nan entry point into the Bayesian apparatus, and it only applies to\nnovel hypotheses. An orthodox Bayesian, such as de Finetti (de Finetti\nand Savage 1972, de Finetti 1974), might have no problem in allowing\nthat analogies play this role.\n\nThe second approach is liberal Bayesianism: we can change our\nprior probabilities in a non-rule-based fashion. Something\nalong these lines is needed if analogical arguments are supposed to\nshift opinion about an already existing hypothesis without\nany new evidence. This is common in fields such as archaeology, as\npart of a strategy that Wylie refers to as \u201cmobilizing old data\nas new evidence\u201d (Wylie and Chapman 2016: 95). As Hawthorne\n(2012) notes, some Bayesians simply accept that both initial\nassignments and ongoing revision of prior probabilities\n(based on plausibility arguments) can be rational, but\n\nthe logic of Bayesian induction (as described here) has\nnothing to say about what values the prior plausibility assessments\nfor hypotheses should have; and it places no restrictions on how they\nmight change.\n\nIn other words, by not stating any rules for this type of probability\nrevision, we avoid the difficulties noted by van Fraassen. This\napproach admits analogical reasoning into the Bayesian tent, but\nacknowledges a dark corner of the tent in which rationality operates\nwithout any clear rules.\n\nRecently, a third approach has attracted interest: analogue\nconfirmation or confirmation via analogue simulation. As\ndescribed in (Dardashti et al. 2017), the idea is as follows:\n\n\nOur key idea is that, in certain circumstances, predictions concerning\ninaccessible phenomena can be confirmed via an analogue simulation in\na different system. (57)\n\n\nDardashti and his co-authors concentrate on a particular example\n (Example 17):\n \u2018dumb holes\u2019 and other analogues to gravitational black\nholes (Unruh 1981; Unruh 2008). Unlike real black holes, some of these\nanalogues can be (and indeed have been) implemented and studied in the\nlab. Given the exact formal analogy between our models for these\nsystems and our models of black holes, and certain important\nadditional assumptions, Dardashti et al. make the controversial claim\nthat observations made about the analogues provide evidence about\nactual black holes. For instance, the observation of phenomena\nanalogous to Hawking radiation in the analogue systems would provide\nconfirmation for the existence of Hawking radiation in black holes. In\na second paper (Dardashti et al. 2018, Other Internet Resources), the\ncase for confirmation is developed within a Bayesian framework.\n\nThe appeal of a clearly articulated mechanism for analogue\nconfirmation is obvious. It would provide a tool for exploring\nconfirmation of inaccessible phenomena not just in cosmology, but also\nin historical sciences such as archaeology and evolutionary biology,\nand in areas of medical science where ethical constraints rule out\nexperiments on human subjects. Furthermore, as noted by Dardashti et\nal., analogue confirmation relies on new evidence obtained\nfrom the analogue system, and is therefore not vulnerable to the\nlogical difficulties noted above.\n\nAlthough the concept of analogue confirmation is not entirely new\n(think of animal testing, as in\n Example 8),\n the claims of (Dardashti et al. 2017, 2018 [Other Internet\nResources]) require evaluation. One immediate difficulty for the black\nhole example: if we think in terms of ordinary analogical arguments,\nthere is no positive analogy because, to put it simply, we\nhave no basis of known similarities between a \u2018dumb hole\u2019\nand a black hole. As Crowther et al. (2018, Other Internet Resources)\nargue, \u201cit is not known if the particular modelling framework\nused in the derivation of Hawking radiation actually describes\nblack holes in the first place.\u201d This may not concern\nDardashti et al., since they claim that analogue confirmation is\ndistinct from ordinary analogical arguments. It may turn out that\nanalogue confirmation is different for cases such as animal testing,\nwhere we have a basis of known similarities, and for cases where our\nonly access to the target domain is via a theoretical model.\n",
