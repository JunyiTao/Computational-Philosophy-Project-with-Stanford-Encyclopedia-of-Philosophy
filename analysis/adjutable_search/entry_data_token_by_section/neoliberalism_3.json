While many characterize\nFriedman (1974a [2017: 72]) as a utilitarian, he says that \u201cI\nmyself have never accepted utilitarianism\u201d. Friedman\u2019s\ndefense of the free market as maximizing utility was never meant to\nimply that people lacked basic rights that might forbid utility\nmaximization in some cases. Friedman focuses on utility-based\nconsiderations because he thinks they have universal appeal. Hayek\n(1988: 69) not only rejects utilitarianism, he rejects the broader\nclass of consequentialist theories of social order: he rejects any\ndemand for justification where morality is grounded in its production\nof some particular goal, like happiness. Hayek (1978: 132) is better\ndescribed as a contractarian.\n",
