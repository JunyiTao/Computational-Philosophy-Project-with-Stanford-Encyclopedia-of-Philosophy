    "main_text": "The Resurgence of Empiricism\n3. The Resurgence of Empiricism\n\n\nThe studies summarized in section 2 are representative of the\nNativist resurgence. Not surprisingly, cognitive scientists with\nEmpiricist sympathies continue to push back: to search for\ncountervailing evidence, to question the methodologies involved in\nthese studies, to develop alternative interpretations of the data, and\nso on. Moreover, as we mentioned at the outset, it is not only\nNativism that has experienced a resurgence; there are important\nresearch directions in the cognitive sciences that seem inherently more\nfriendly to the Empiricist position. In this section we briefly\ndescribe and contextualize some of these developments.\n",
