Relations Between Temporal Parts\n\nSuppose we accept that ordinary persisting things have temporal parts.\nWhat can we say about the relations which hold between those temporal\nparts? For example: must the different temporal parts of a single\nobject lie along a smooth trajectory through space and time, or can\nobjects jump about instantaneously, or pop out of and back into\nexistence? Similar questions also arise for endurantists, and not all\nperdurantists answer these questions in the same way, but for the most\npart perdurantists do agree on a particular type of answer to these\nquestions. This is because perdurantism is very often held in\nconjunction with two other doctrines: the doctrine of universalism,\nand that of Humean Supervenience.\n\nUniversalism is the view that any collection of objects whatsoever has\na sum, an object they compose. Thinking just of the present moment,\nthis entails that there is an object composed right now of your left\near, the front fork of your bicycle, and the Louvre. If you think\nabout all times, and imagine that ordinary things are made of\ninstantaneous temporal parts, then you can see that universalist\nperdurantists believe in quite an extraordinary number of objects. Any\ncombination of temporal parts of any objects from any times, no matter\nhow scattered and disparate, composes an object. So there is an object\nmade of your maternal grandmother\u2019s wedding ring on the day she\nwas married, your right ear yesterday and a brief temporal part of an\nelectron in the year 2525. (Universalism is sometimes called\n\u2018unrestricted mereology\u2019, \u2018unrestricted\ncomposition\u2019 or \u2018unrestricted fusion\u2019;\n\u2018fusion\u2019 means \u2018sum\u2019. For more on\nuniversalism, see the separate entry on\n mereology,\n especially section 4.2.)\n\nThere are a number of reasons why perdurantists typically adopt\nuniversalism\u00a0 First, the claim that there is a large number of\nnested four-dimensional objects is central to the most common\nperdurantist account of vagueness in persistence (see\n section 5).\n The building doesn\u2019t seem to have a clear last moment of\nexistence because there are very many coinciding building-shaped\nfour-dimensional objects, each of which ends at a slightly different\nmoment, and it is vague which of these is \u2018the building\u2019.\nWhether its role in this story is a reason to accept universalism\ndepends upon the strength or weakness of alternative accounts of\nvagueness in persistence.\n\nSecond, it often seems that whether or not an object survives a\ncertain kind of change is in some sense conventional, or up to us.\nMany believe that we set the standards for how many repairs you can\nmake to your bicycle without destroying it, and that whether or not a\nperson can survive massive memory loss is partly a matter of what we\nmean by \u2018person\u2019. How things persist seems sometimes to be\na matter of what kind of classifications we choose to use. A radical\nversion of this suggests that physical objects come into and out of\nexistence when we decide they do. This sounds mysterious: how could we\nhave such powers? But the combination of universalism and perdurantism\npermits a less radical version of the view: there are lots of\nfour-dimensional objects which share temporal parts with the wheeled\nthing in your bike shed, and it\u2019s up to us which one of those\ncounts as a \u2018bicycle\u2019. Similarly, perhaps it\u2019s up to\nus which of the multitude of four-dimensional objects count as\n\u2018people\u2019.\u00a0\n\nThird, perdurantists who reject universalism seem committed to giving\nan account of the difference between collections of temporal parts\nwhich have a sum, and collections which do not. But such accounts seem\nto permit borderline cases, in which it\u2019s not clear whether a\ncertain collection has a sum. And borderline cases look like cases in\nwhich it is not clear whether a certain object (the sum of those\nparts) exists or not. And many find such vagueness in existence\nunacceptable. Objections to this argument turn on whether\nnon-universalists really have to give such an account, and on whether\nvague existence really is unacceptable.\n\nThis third type of argument for universalism has also been used to\nargue directly for the existence of temporal parts. Roughly speaking,\ninstead of asking which temporal parts have a sum, we ask which\nmatter-filled regions exactly contain objects. Unless we agree that\nthey all do, we will get into trouble with borderline cases,\nas in the previous paragraph. But if every matter-filled region\nexactly contains an object, then even three-dimensional matter-filled\nregions exactly contain objects. So the world is full of instantaneous\nobjects: these look very like temporal parts. This argument is now\noften known as the \u2018argument from vagueness\u2019. Objections\nhere include those mentioned in the previous paragraph; we might also\nquestion whether the instantaneous objects are really temporal\nparts.\n\nHowever they argue for their position, perdurantists who are also\nuniversalists have an easy answer to some questions about what paths\nobjects may take through space-time: any series of\nobject-stages composes an object. It is certainly interesting to ask\nwhich of those objects are bicycles, or ships, or people, but these\nnow look like questions about the classification of objects, rather\nthan questions about persistence.\n\nThe other doctrine which usually goes along with perdurantism is\nHumean Supervenience. This is the claim that, roughly speaking, facts\nabout which intrinsic properties are instantiated at which points\ndetermine all the facts there are. There are no irreducibly holistic\nfacts. In conjunction with perdurantism, this entails that all the\nfacts about a given persisting object supervene upon intrinsic facts\nabout its briefest temporal parts. That\u2019s to say, if you fix\nwhat\u2019s happening at each moment, you\u2019ve fixed everything.\nThis sounds pretty plausible, but it turns out that it\u2019s rather\ndifficult to reduce facts about motion, for example, to suitable\nmoment-by-moment facts.\n\nThere are various responses to this difficulty. Endurantists are not\nusually tempted by Humean Supervenience, since they are committed to\nfacts about identity between objects wholly existing at different\ntimes, and these identity facts are not easily reducible to\nmoment-by-moment facts. So some take the difficulty for Humean\nSupervenience to be a reason for adopting endurantism. Some\nperdurantists stick with perdurantism, but reject Humean\nSupervenience. Instead, they accept that some facts about persisting\nobjects cannot be reduced to facts about their briefest temporal\nparts; they may accept, for example, that causal relations between\nearlier and later parts are irreducible in this way. Finally, some\nperdurantists insist that the supposed facts which seem to cause\nproblems for Humean Supervenience are not real facts after all.\n\nSuggested Reading: Lewis (1986a, pp. 212\u20133),\nHeller (1990, section 2.9), Jubien (1993, section 2.2), Quine (1981,\nchapter 1), Rea (1998a) and Hudson (2000) argue for universalism; van\nInwagen (1990b, section 8), Markosian (1998), Merricks (2001) and\nVarzi (2003) object in various ways. Balashov (2007a) discusses\nuniversalism and stage theory; Campdelacreu (2010) responds. Sosa\n(1999) investigates the options for endurantist universalism, whilst\nMiller (2006) develops an endurantist \u2018universalism\u2019 based\non constitution rather than parthood; see also Inman (2014). Sider\n(1997; 2001, section 4.9) develops the \u2018argument from\nvagueness\u2019 via universalism to temporal parts; Koslicki (2003)\nis critical, while Sider (2003a) responds. Further discussions of\nSider\u2019s argument include Balashov (2005), Nolan (2006),\nMarkosian (2004), Sider (2004), Miller (2005a), Varzi (2005), Noonan\n(2010), Magidor (2015) and Eagle (2016b). Korman (2010) provides an\noverview of this debate, with further references. Hirsch (1982) is an\nextensive, rewarding discussion of criteria of persistence. Humean\nSupervenience is articulated by Lewis (1986b, pp. ix-x), and discussed\nby Loewer (1996). The problem about motion is raised by Armstrong\n(1980), and addressed by Robinson (1989) Hawley (1999; 2001, chapter\n3), Zimmerman (1998b; 1999), Callender (2001), Sider (2001, section\n6.5), Lewis (1999), Teller (2002) and Butterfield (2006), while\nJaskolla (2017) makes intriguing connections between this debate and\npanpsychism. Butterfield (2005) raises many interesting connections\nbetween the physics of motion and the metaphysics of persistence, see\nalso Pashby (2016). Balashov (2003a, 2003b, 2010), Hudson (2002,\n2003), Effingham (2011) and Torre (2015) discuss issues about\nrestricted composition and laws of nature. Haslanger (1994) discusses\nthe connection between endurance and Humean Supervenience; Hawley\n(2015) discusses links between persistence, temporary intrinsics and\nHumean Supervenience in Lewis\u2019s work. Oakes (2004) raises causal\ndifficulties for perdurantism without relying on HS. Magidor (2016)\nargues that much of the debate around perdurance and endurance looks\nvery different when we notice implicit assumptions about universalism;\nsee also Miller (2008) and Varzi (2007). Della Rocca (2011) argues\nthat endurantists must adopt an implausible kind of anti-reductionism\nabout persistence; Baker (2013) responds.\n",
