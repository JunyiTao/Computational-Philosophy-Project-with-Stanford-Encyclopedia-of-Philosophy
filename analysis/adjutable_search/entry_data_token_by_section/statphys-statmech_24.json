    "main_text": "Further Issues || The Gibbs Paradox\n7.3 The Gibbs Paradox\n\nSo far, we have considered how one gas evolves. Now let\u2019s look\nat what happens when we mix two gases. Again, consider a container\nwith a partition wall in the middle, but now imagine that there are\ntwo different gases on the left and on the right (for\ninstance helium and hydrogen) where both gases have the same\ntemperature. We now remove the shutter, and the gases start spreading\nand get mixed. If we then calculate the entropy of the initial and the\nfinal state of the two gases, we find that the entropy of the mixture\nis greater than the entropy of the gases in their initial\ncompartments. This is the result that we expect. The paradox arises\nfrom the fact that the calculations do not depend on the fact\nthat the gases are different: if we assume that we have air of the\nsame temperature on both sides of the barrier the calculations still\nyield an increase in entropy when the barrier is removed. This seems\nwrong because it would imply that the entropy of a gas depends on its\nhistory and cannot be a function of its thermodynamic state alone (as\nthermodynamics requires). This is known as the Gibbs\nParadox.\n\nThe standard textbook resolution of the paradox is that classical SM\ngets the entropy wrong because it counts states that differ only by a\npermutation of two indistinguishable particles as distinct, which is a\nmistake (Huang 1963). So the problem is rooted in the notion of\nindividuality, which is seen as inherent to classical mechanics.\nTherefore, so the argument goes, the problem is resolved by quantum\nmechanics, which treats indistinguishable particles in the right way.\nThis argument raises a number of questions concerning the nature of\nindividuality in classical and quantum mechanics, the way of counting\nstates in both the Boltzmann and the Gibbs approach, and the relation\nof SM to thermodynamics. Classical discussions include Denbigh and\nDenbigh\u00a0(1985: Ch. 4), Denbigh and Redhead(1989), Jaynes (1992),\nLand\u00e9 (1965), Rosen (1964), and van Kampen (1984). For more\nrecent discussions, see, for instance, Huggett (1999), Saunders\n(2006), and Wills (forthcoming), as well as the contributions to Dieks\nand Saunders (2018) and references therein.\n",
