    "main_text": "Science || Cosmology\n5.2 Cosmology\n\n\nA central part of On Rays explains that the stars and\nplanets bring about events in the sublunary world by means of rays\nemitted from the heavenly bodies to points on the earth\u2019s\nsurface. This differs from an account found in several other\ncosmological treatises by al-Kindi, where he follows Alexander of\nAphrodisias in holding that the heavenly bodies literally heat up the\nlower world by means of friction as they pass over it. In either case,\nhowever, the account given is intended to explain the efficacy of the\nscience of astrology. Al-Kindi wrote numerous works on this subject,\nand his associate Abu Ma\u2018shar was the greatest figure in Arabic\nastrology. Both of them saw astrology as a rational science,\nundergirded by a well-worked out theory of physical causes (see further\nBurnett 1993, Adamson 2002a).\n\n\nAl-Kindi\u2019s corpus includes several treatises on cosmology,\nexplaining and defending a picture of the cosmos as four concentric\ncircles of elements, which are mixed together by the outer, heavenly\nspheres to yield complex compound substances like minerals, plants, and\nanimals. Though al-Kindi\u2019s main influences are works of Aristotle\nand his commentators, especially Alexander, he also knows something of\nthe Timaeus, as is shown by a treatise explaining why Plato\nassociated the elements and heavens with the Platonic solids (Abu Rida\n1953, 54\u201363; also Rescher 1968).\n\n\nOne respect in which al-Kindi follows Alexander is his conviction that\nthe heavenly spheres are the means by which God exercises providence\nover the sublunary world (see Fazzo and Wiesner 1993).  Al-Kindi\u2019s\nbold claims for astrology already commit him to the idea that a wide\nrange of specific events can be predicted on the basis of astral\ncausation. His doctrine of providence goes further by implying that\nall events in the lower world are caused by the stars,\nwhich are carrying out the benign \u201ccommand\u201d of God. This\ndoctrine is set out in On the Prostration of the Outermost\nSphere (Abu Rida 1950, 244\u2013261, Rashed and Jolivet 1998, 177\u201399)\nand On the Proximate Agent Cause of Generation and Corruption\n(Abu Rida 1950, 214\u2013237). The former explains that the heavens are\npossessed of souls, and freely follow God\u2019s command so as to move in\nsuch a way that the providentially intended sublunary things and\nevents will come about. This, according to al-Kindi, is what the Koran\nrefers to when it says that the stars \u201cprostrate\u201d\nthemselves before God. In Proximate Agent Cause, meanwhile,\nal-Kindi gives a more detailed account of the means by which the\nheavens cause things in the lower world (here he invokes friction, not\nrays). The most obvious effect of the stars on our world is of course\nthe seasons, because the sun (due to its size and proximity) is the\nheavenly body with the most powerful effect. If there were no such\nheavenly causation, according to al-Kindi, the elements would never\nhave combined at all, and the lower realm would consist of four\nspheres of unmixed earth, water, air and fire.\n\n\nAl-Kindi\u2019s account of astral causation and providence is a very good\nexample of his philosophical method: combining and building on ideas\ntaken from Aristotle, later Greek philosophers, and\n\u201cscientific\u201d authors like Ptolemy, he gives a rational\naccount of a central concept in Islam. Prostration shows that\nhe is even willing to use such an account to expound the Koran itself.\nAl-Kindi is confident that, once exposed to judicious presentations of\nGreek wisdom, his more enlightened contemporaries and sponsors will\nagree that these foreign texts can be used \u2014 jointly with\nautochthonous \u201cArabic\u201d disciplines like grammar \u2014 in\nthe service of a deeper understanding of Islam itself.\n",
