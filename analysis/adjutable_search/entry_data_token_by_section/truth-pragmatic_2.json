    "main_text": "History of the Pragmatic Theory of Truth || James\u2019 Pragmatic Theory of Truth\n1.2 James\u2019 Pragmatic Theory of Truth\n\nPeirce\u2019s contemporary, the psychologist and philosopher William\nJames (1842\u20131910), often gets credit for popularizing the\npragmatic theory of truth. In a series of popular lectures and\narticles, James offers an account of truth that, like Peirce\u2019s,\nis grounded in the practical role played by the concept of truth.\nJames, too, stresses that truth represents a kind of satisfaction:\ntrue beliefs are satisfying beliefs, in some sense. Unlike Peirce,\nhowever, James suggests that true beliefs can be satisfying short of\nbeing indefeasible and unassailable: short, that is, of how they would\nstand up to ongoing inquiry and investigation. In the lectures\npublished as Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of\nThinking (1907) James writes that:\n\n\nIdeas\u2026become true just in so far as they help us get into\nsatisfactory relation with other parts of our experience, to summarize\nthem and get about among them by conceptual short-cuts instead of\nfollowing the interminable succession of particular phenomena. (1907\n[1975: 34])\n\n\nTrue ideas, James suggests, are like tools: they make us more\nefficient by helping us do the things that need to get done. James\nadds to the previous quote by making the connection between truth and\nutility explicit:\n\n\nAny idea upon which we can ride, so to speak; any idea that will carry\nus prosperously from any one part of our experience to any other part,\nlinking things satisfactorily, working securely, simplifying, saving\nlabor; is true for just so much, true in so far forth, true\ninstrumentally. This is the \u2018instrumental\u2019 view\nof truth. (1907 [1975: 34])\n\n\nWhile James, here, credits this view to John Dewey and F.C.S.\nSchiller, it is clearly a view he endorses as well. To understand\ntruth, he argues, we must consider the practical difference\u2014or\nthe pragmatic \u201ccash-value\u201d (1907 [1975: 97]) of having\ntrue beliefs. True beliefs, he suggests, are useful and dependable in\nways that false beliefs are not:\n\n\nyou can say of it then either that \u201cit is useful because it is\ntrue\u201d or that \u201cit is true because it is useful\u201d.\nBoth these phrases mean exactly the same thing. (1907 [1975: 98])\n\n\nPassages such as this have cemented James\u2019 reputation for\nequating truth with mere utility (something along the lines of:\n\u201c< p > is true just in case it is useful to\nbelieve that p\u201d [see Schmitt 1995: 78]). (James does\noffer the qualification \u201cin the long run and on the whole of\ncourse\u201d (1907 [1975: 106]) to indicate that truth is different\nfrom instant gratification, though he does not say how long the long\nrun should be.) Such an account might be viewed as a watered-down\nversion of Peirce\u2019s account that substitutes\n\u201ccash-value\u201d or subjective satisfaction for\nindefeasibility and unassailability in the face of ongoing inquiry and\ninvestigation. Such an account might also be viewed as obviously\nwrong, given the undeniable existence of useless truths and useful\nfalsehoods.\n\nIn the early twentieth century Peirce\u2019s writings were not yet\nwidely available. As a result, the pragmatic theory of truth was\nfrequently identified with James\u2019 account\u2014and, as we will\nsee, many philosophers did view it as obviously wrong. James, in turn,\naccused his critics of willful misunderstanding: that because he wrote\nin an accessible, engaging style his critics \u201chave boggled at\nevery word they could boggle at, and refused to take the spirit rather\nthan the letter of our discourse\u201d (1909 [1975: 99]). However, it\nis also the case that James tends to overlook or intentionally\nblur\u2014it is hard to say which\u2014the distinction between (a)\ngiving an account of true ideas and (b) giving an account of the\nconcept of truth. This means that, while James\u2019 theory might\ngive a psychologically realistic account of why we care about the\ntruth (true ideas help us get things done) his theory fails to shed\nmuch light on what the concept of truth exactly is or on what makes an\nidea true. And, in fact, James often seems to encourage this reading.\nIn the preface to The Meaning of Truth he doubles down by\nquoting many of his earlier claims and noting that \u201cwhen the\npragmatists speak of truth, they mean exclusively something about the\nideas, namely their workableness\u201d (1909 [1975: 6],\nemphasis added). James\u2019 point seems to be this: from a practical\nstandpoint, we use the concept of truth to signal our confidence in a\nparticular idea or belief; a true belief is one that can be acted\nupon, that is dependable and that leads to predictable outcomes; any\nfurther speculation is a pointless distraction.\n\nWhat then about the concept of truth? It often seems that James\nunderstands the concept of truth in terms of verification: thus,\n\u201ctrue is the name for whatever idea starts the\nverification-process, useful is the name for its completed function in\nexperience\u201d (1907 [1975: 98]). And, more generally:\n\n\nTruth for us is simply a collective name for verification-processes,\njust as health, wealth, strength, etc., are names for other processes\nconnected with life, and also pursued because it pays to pursue them.\n(1907 [1975: 104])\n\n\nJames seems to claim that being verified is what makes an idea true,\njust as having a lot of money is what makes a person wealthy. To be\ntrue is to be verified:\n\n\nTruth happens to an idea. It becomes true, is\nmade true by events. Its verity is in fact an event,\na process: the process namely of its verifying itself, its\nveri-fication. Its validity is the process of its\nvalid-ation. (1907 [1975: 97], emphasis in original)\n\n\nLike Peirce, James argues that a pragmatic account of truth is\nsuperior to a correspondence theory because it specifies, in concrete\nterms, what it means for an idea to correspond or \u201cagree\u201d\nwith reality. For pragmatists, this agreement consists in being led\n\u201ctowards that reality and no other\u201d in a way that yields\n\u201csatisfaction as a result\u201d (1909 [1975: 104]). By\nsometimes defining truth in terms of verification, and by unpacking\nthe agreement of ideas and reality in pragmatic terms, James\u2019\naccount attempts to both criticize and co-opt the correspondence\ntheory of truth.\n",
