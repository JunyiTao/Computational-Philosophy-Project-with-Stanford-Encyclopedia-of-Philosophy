    "main_text": "Supervenience and Other Relations || Tallying Up\n3.8 Tallying Up\n\nSupervenience gives us less than some philosophers have thought. Even\nlogically or metaphysically necessary supervenience is compatible with\nthere being no B-properties that entail any\nA-properties. Supervenience is not itself explanatory, and\ndoes not guarantee that the A-properties either reduce to,\nontologically depend upon, or are grounded by the\nB-properties. It might provide a way to capture the thought\nthat A-properties or facts are not a further ontological\ncommitment over and above the B-properties or facts, but this\nis controversial. At heart, all a supervenience claim says is that\nA-properties covary with B-properties.\nNevertheless, as we shall see in\n Section 5,\n supervenience has a variety of philosophical uses.\n",
