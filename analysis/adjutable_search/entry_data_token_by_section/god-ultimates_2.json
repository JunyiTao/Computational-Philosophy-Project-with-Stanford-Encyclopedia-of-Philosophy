    "main_text": "Conceptual Foundations and Motivations || Motivations\n1.3 Motivations\n\nUnderstanding the scope of the work on modeling what is ultimate is\ncentral in multiple ways for assessing claims about its existence.\nFirst, the meaning we have in mind for \u201cx\u201d can\ndecide our take on whether x exists. For example, in the case\nof God, some are convinced by arguments from suffering that there is\nno God, but such arguments, even if they succeed, generally apply only\nto God conceived as an omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent\n(\u201cOOO\u201d) person and as written do not apply to God\nconceived differently (\u201cgenerally\u201d since there are notable\nexceptions, e.g., Bishop 2007 and Bishop & Perszyk 2016). Further,\nthe act of abandoning one model while being aware that there are\nalternative models can set up an exploration into the field of models\nof the ultimate or ultimates. For example, if one decides there is no\nOOO personal God, one might ask: are there any other models\nof God genuinely worth the name \u201cGod\u201d without these\nproperties? If not, are there perhaps any non-theistic (non-God)\nmodels of what is ultimate without these properties? In other words,\nfor those who have a limited sense of what it takes to be ultimate\n(e.g., what is ultimate is a OOO God or nothing at all), a search of\nextant models can open up the range of options on their menu and\nposition them to see whether any are philosophically palatable. In\nfact, such a search may be required in order to settle the question of\nwhether anything ultimate exists, because it is invalid to conclude\nthat there is nothing ultimate on the basis of arguments against\nspecific models of ultimacy if there could still be genuine ultimacy\nof another kind (see Diller 2016: 123\u2013124).\n\nIn addition to their pivotal role in deciding questions of existence,\nnotions of what is ultimate profoundly impact questions about\nreligious diversity, such as whether multiple religions can have\nsimultaneously true core beliefs. For example, on \u201cplenitude of\nbeing\u201d models\u2014where the ultimate is infinitely full of\nincommensurable content\u2014multiple religions are taken to be\ngrasping different aspects of it accurately. So multiple religions can\nhave true beliefs about what is ultimate, even if each has only a part\nof the truth. Finally, models of what is ultimate are also intimately\nbound up with philosophical questions of meaning, e.g., in\nmeaning\u2019s \u201cCosmic\u201d and \u201cUltimate\u201d senses\nas Rivka Weinberg explains them, though she decides that even if there\nwere something ultimate, it would not finally deliver meaning in\neither sense (2021).\n",
