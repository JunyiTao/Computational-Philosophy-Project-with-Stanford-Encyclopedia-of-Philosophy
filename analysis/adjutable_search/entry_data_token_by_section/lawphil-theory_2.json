    "main_text": "Relativism and Reduction\n3. The Normativity of Law\n\n\n Let us now see how\nKelsen thought that the basic norm helps to explain the sense in which\nlaw is a normative domain and what this normativity consists in. The\nfirst and crucial point to realize is that for Kelsen the idea of\nnormativity is tantamount to a genuine \u201cought\u201d, as it were;\nit is a justified demand on practical deliberation. A certain content\nis regarded as normative by an agent if and only if the agent regards\nthat content as a valid reason for action. As Joseph Raz noticed,\nKelsen agrees with the Natural Law tradition in this particular\nrespect; both assume that the normativity of law can only be explained\nas one would explain the normativity of morality, or religion for that\nmatter, namely, in terms of valid reasons for action (Raz 1979,\n134\u2013137; but cf. Paulson 2012). But then, the problem for Kelsen is how\nto explain the difference between the normativity of law and that of\nmorality; if legal \u201cought\u201d is a genuine\n\u201cought\u201d, what makes a legal obligation distinct from a\nmoral one? Kelsen\u2019s answer is that the relevant\n\u201cought\u201d is always relative to a given point of view. Each\nand every type of \u201cought\u201d, be it religious, moral or legal,\nmust presuppose a certain point of view, a point of view which is\nconstituted by the basic norm of the relevant normative system.\n\n\nIn other words, Kelsen\u2019s conception of legal normativity turns\nout to be a form of Natural Law completely relativized to a certain\npoint of view. However, in Kelsen\u2019s theory the relevant point of\nview is distinctly a legal one, not some general conception of morality\nor Reason. That these two basic norms, or points of view, can come\napart, is nicely demonstrated by Kelsen\u2019s comment that\n\u201ceven an anarchist, if he were a professor of law, could describe\npositive law as a system of valid norms, without having to approve of\nthis law\u201d (PT2 218n). The anarchist does not endorse the\nlegal point of view as one that reflects her own views about what is\nright and wrong. Anarchism is understood here precisely as a rejection\nof the normative validity of law; however, even the anarchist can make\nan argument about what the law in this or that context requires; and\nwhen she makes such an argument, she must presuppose the legal point of\nview, she must argue as if she endorses the basic norm of the relevant\nlegal system. Joseph Raz has called these kinds of statements\n\u201cdetached normative statements\u201d; the anarchist argues as if\nshe endorses the basic norm, without actually endorsing it. Another\nexample that Raz gave is this: suppose that at Catholic priest is an\nexpert in Jewish Law; the priest can make various interpretative\narguments about what Jewish law really requires in this or that\ncontext. In such a case, the priest must argue as if he endorses the\nbasic norm of Jewish Law, but of course, being a Catholic, he does not\nreally endorse it, it does not reflect his own views about what is\nright and wrong (Raz 1979, 153\u2013157).\n\n\nSo here is what emerges so far: the concept of normativity, the\nsense in which normative content is related to reasons for action, is\nthe same across all normative domains. To regard something as normative\nis to regard it as justified, as a warranted requirement on practical\ndeliberation. However, the difference resides in the difference in\npoints of view. Each basic norm determines, as it were, a certain point\nof view. So it turns out that normativity (contra Kant) always consists\nof conditional imperatives: if, and only if, one endorses a\ncertain normative point of view, determined by its basic norm, then the\nnorms that follow from it are reason giving, so to speak. This enables\nKelsen to maintain the same understanding of the nature of normativity\nas Natural Law\u2019s conception, namely, normativity qua reasons for\naction, without having to conflate the normativity of morality with\nthat of law. In other words, the difference between legal normativity\nand, say, moral normativity, is not a difference in normativity (viz,\nabout the nature of normativity, per se), but only in the relevant\nvantage point that is determined by their different basic norms. What\nmakes legal normativity unique is the uniqueness of its point of view,\nthe legal point of view, as it were.\n\n\n We can set aside\nthe difficulties that such a view raises with respect to morality.\nObviously, many philosophers would reject Kelsen\u2019s view that\nmoral reasons for action only apply to those who choose to endorse\nmorality\u2019s basic norm (whatever it may be). Even if Kelsen is\nquite wrong about this conditional nature of moral imperatives, he may\nbe right about the law. What remains questionable, however, is whether\nKelsen succeeds in providing a non-reductive explanation of legal\nnormativity, given the fact that his account of legal validity turned\nout to be reductive after all. The trouble here is not simply the\nrelativity to a point of view; the trouble resides in Kelsen\u2019s\nfailure to ground the choice of the relevant point of view in anything\nlike Reason or reasons of any kind. By deliberately avoiding any\nexplanation of what it is that might ground an agent\u2019s choice of\nendorsing the legal point of view, or any given basic norm, Kelsen left\nthe most pressing questions about the normativity of law unanswered.\nInstead of providing an explanation of what makes the\npresupposition of the legal point of view rational, or what makes it\nrational to regard the requirements of law as binding requirements,\nKelsen invites us to stop asking.\n",
