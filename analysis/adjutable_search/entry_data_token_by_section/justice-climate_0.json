    "main_text": "Isolationism and Integrationism\n1. Isolationism and Integrationism\n\nIt is helpful to draw attention to a distinction between two\ndifferent ways in which one might approach issues of climate\njustice.\n\nOne approach\u2014Isolationism\u2014holds that it is best to treat\nthe ethical issues posed by climate change in isolation from other\nissues (such as poverty, migration, trade and so forth). The\nisolationist seeks to bracket these other considerations and treat\nclimate change on its own. A second\napproach\u2014Integrationism\u2014holds that it is best to treat the\nethical issues posed by climate change in light of a general theory of\njustice and in conjunction with other issues (such as poverty,\ndevelopment and so on).\n\nSome philosophers have adopted an isolationist approach. Some, for\nexample, propose principles for allocating rights to emit greenhouse\ngases that treat greenhouse gases in isolation from other issues\n (Section 6.2).\n Two related reasons are given for this approach. First, some argue\nthat there is value in simplifying the issue, and since introducing\nthese other concerns would complicate the question it is worth\nbracketing them out. Second, some make a related pragmatic argument\nabout the implications of adopting an integrationist approach for\nreaching agreement in climate negotiations. They argue that insisting\nthat climate justice be pursued in light of a general theory, and in\nconjunction with other issues, would be a recipe for deadlock because\nthere is often deep disagreement about what theory of justice is\ncorrect. For this reason, they propose bracketing out other phenomena\nand treating climate change in isolation (Blomfield 2019: 24;\nGosseries 2005: 283; L. Meyer & Roser 2006: 239).\n\nIn reply, those who favour an integrationist approach tend to offer the\nfollowing considerations. First, they argue that in order to treat\nclimate change in isolation there would need to be something special\nabout it that warranted separate treatment. However, they argue,\nclimate change is not special in this way. For example, it impacts on\nthe same interests (people\u2019s interests in food and water; their\nhealth; their access to land and so on) as other phenomena (such as\nthe distribution of economic resources, poverty and poverty\nalleviation, migration, and trade). Furthermore, they claim that the\nsame distributive principles seem to be salient for climate change as\nthey are for other phenomena. If, for example, one thinks that\nindividuals have human rights to meet their socio-economic needs then\nthis should surely also bear on questions of climate justice too since\nit provides a reason to combat climate change and a reason to\ndistribute responsibilities so that they do not burden the poor and\nvulnerable. Another way of putting this point is that when people\nengage in deliberation about, say, how the costs of tackling climate\nchange should be distributed then\u2014so Integrationists\nclaim\u2014they inescapably end up drawing on more general values\n(such as \u201cpeople have a right to a decent standard of\nliving\u201d or \u201cpeople should be accountable for their\nchoices\u201d) (Caney 2005: 763 & 765\u2013766). If philosophers\neschew Integrationism and they try to answer questions such as\n\u201cwho should bear the burdens of combating climate change?\u201d\nin an isolationist fashion\u2014bracketing out, for example, what\neconomic rights persons have\u2014then, so the argument runs, we end\nup with very counter-intuitive conclusions (Caney 2018b:\n682\u2013684).\n\nWhether this is true or not cannot be fully resolved in advance.\nRather it can only be decided by engaging in a normative analysis of\nclimate change and seeing whether it is borne out.\n\nA second point that those who favour an Integrationist approach might\nmake is that climate change is causally interconnected with a wide\nvariety of other phenomena\u2014such as economic growth, poverty\nreduction, migration, health, trade, natural resource ownership, and\ncultural rights\u2014such that it is artificial to treat it on its\nown. Climate change does not present itself to us as a discrete problem\nthat can be treated separately. Rather it is part and parcel of a\nlarger process. It is an upshot of people\u2019s activity (primarily\nthrough the use of energy) and, as such, it is causally intertwined\nwith economic growth, poverty alleviation, urban design, and land use.\nFurthermore, the effects of climatic change are often mediated through\nother factors such as poverty, existing infrastructures, and the\nresponsiveness of political authorities. They interact with existing\ninequalities and vulnerability, producing what Leichenko and\nO\u2019Brien (2008) term \u201cdouble exposures\u201d. In addition\nto this, the extraction of fossil fuels and the industry built around\nit often directly harm the same interests (such as health and access\nto land) that are harmed by the emission of greenhouse gases. So, from\nthis point of view, it seems artificial to focus on the effect of the\nemissions rather than the whole phenomenon. Finally, the policies\nproposed to tackle climate change themselves affect a wide range of\nother phenomena (impacting on land use, access to food, health,\npoverty alleviation, biodiversity loss, individual liberty, and so\non). Given this any attempt to cordon off climate change and apply\nprinciples of justice to it in isolation seems misguided and\nquixotic.\n\nAs we shall see\u2014especially when we consider the distribution of\nresponsibilities and the application of principles of distributive\njustice to the greenhouse gas budget\u2014it matters a great deal\nwhether one takes an Isolationist or Integrationist perspective.\n\nWith this point duly noted, we can turn to the substantive issues.\n",
