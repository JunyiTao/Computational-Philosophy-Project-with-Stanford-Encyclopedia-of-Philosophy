Price belongs with the group of British\nphilosophers whom Sellars (1956 [1997]) discusses, along with Ayer,\nRyle, and earlier Empiricists. But Sellars, who was a pupil of Price\n(see, e.g., Crane 2013: 246; deVries 2005: 4\u20135; Triplett 2023:\n1), doesn\u2019t single out Price for criticism, instead positively\nappealing to Price in other contexts (e.g., Price\u2019s [1953a: 73]\nunderstanding of abstract thinking, \u201cthinking in absence\u201d\n[1956 [1997: 65]], and Price [1953a: 185\u2013187] on the\n\u201cthermometer view\u201d [1956 [1997: 66]]). Overall, Sellars\ndoesn\u2019t clearly oppose Price\u2019s notion of the given. Most\nrecently, Triplett (2023: 6) argues that (a) Sellars\u2019 argument\ndoesn\u2019t touch Price\u2019s sense-datum theory, as Sellars\nrelies on understanding sensing as entailing propositional\nknowledge; (b), nor does Hicks\u2019s (2020: 12) reconstruction of\nSellars\u2019 argument, according to which sensing requires\nconceptualisation, since Price explicitly understands sensing as a\ndirect acquaintance with sense-data. See also Triplett 2014; Crane\n2013: 229, 246; O\u2019Shea (2007: 109\u2013111, 112\u2013113)\nargues that Price (1932: 7) anticipates Sellars\u2019s objections\nagainst the given.\n\nHis (1969: 50\u201371) later developments of\nknowledge-by-acquaintance take it to be knowledge of items, say a\nplace, a person, or something abstract like a poem, which we ascribe\nin the form \u201cS knows X\u201d (1969: 47\u201363).\nSuch knowledge requires two things (1969: 55): \n\nthe subject has encountered the item X\n(\u201cfirst-handedness\u201d), and\nthe subject has familiarised themselves through their encounters\nwith X (familiarity).\n\n\nPrice then argues that we are not acquainted with sense-data or\nexperiences (1969: 57\u201360), because, being so fleeting, subjects\ncannot familiarise themselves with them (1969: 58f). Whether this\nundermines the support for Price\u2019s being a target of\nSellars\u2019 (1956 [1997]) criticism is debatable. What are basic\nand given (though after 1960 he no longer uses these words) are\nordinary persisting objects and their properties, known through\nacquaintance, that is, in a first-hand, familiarised way. (In 1932:\n63, however, he follows other sense-data theorists in rejecting this:\n\u201cI am not acquainted with an actual instance of\ntableness\u201d, thus not with actual tables; see also 1927: 110).\nThis acquaintance is more fundamental than knowledge from sense-data\nand grounds knowledge-by-description, on pain of the latter \u201cnot\ndeserv[ing] the name of knowledge, not even of reasonable belief\n\u2026 [and] hav[ing] no relation to reality\u201d (1969: 68; Price\n[1936: passim] similarly attacks the coherence theory of\ntruth; for discussion: Kneale 1996: vi; Robinson 1972: passim\ncriticises Price\u2019s notion of corrigibility).\n\nPrice\u2019s (1932) assumptions about the given and the\nanalysis of sense-data he derives from them are now controversial.\nMuch of Price\u2019s discussion of sense-data amounts to speculation\nabout how we develop our understanding of the world and its contents,\nwhere the real check on that speculation, pace his attitude\ntowards appeals to science (1932: 2;\n \u00a72.1\n above), comes from developmental psychology and its empirical study\nof the emergence of our world-directed thoughts.\n\nPrice (1964a) is often ignored and indirectly addresses some of\nAustin\u2019s (1962) criticisms. Price (1952a) extensively discusses\nseeming; for discussion: Quinton (1952). Other discussions of Price on\nperception include Murray 1933 and Bauer 1967.\n",
