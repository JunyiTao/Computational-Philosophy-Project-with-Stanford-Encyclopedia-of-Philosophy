    "main_text": "Aesthetics || Judgments of Beauty: Some Criticisms\n2.4 Judgments of Beauty: Some Criticisms\n\nAs noted at the end of\n Section 2.2,\n Kant\u2019s account of judgments of beauty has been criticized on\nthe grounds that the argument for their universal validity, that is\nthe Deduction of Pure Aesthetic Judgments, is unsuccessful. Criticisms\nhave also been raised against various aspects of Kant\u2019s\ncharacterization of judgments of beauty in the Analytic of the\nBeautiful. Objections have been raised in particular to Kant\u2019s\nview that judgments of beauty are disinterested, and to his supposed\ncommitment to aesthetic formalism (the view that all that matters for\naesthetic appreciation is the abstract formal pattern manifested by\nthe object, that is, the way in which its elements are interrelated in\nspace and/or time). For discussion of the questions of\ndisinterestedness and formalism, see Guyer (1979 [1997: chs. 5 and\n6]), and Allison (2001: chs. 4 and 5); Zuckert offers a sympathetic\nreading of Kant\u2019s formalism (2007a: 182\u2013189). Kant\u2019s\nformalism was particularly influential, via the influence of Hanslick,\nin musical theory; for discussion see Kivy (2009: ch. 2). Discussions\nof this topic often note that although the Analytic of the Beautiful\nputs forward a formalist view, Kant\u2019s treatment of aesthetic\nideas (discussed in\n Section 2.6)\n is more congenial to an expressivist view of art.\n\nTypically objections to Kant\u2019s view of pleasure as disinterested\nappeal to the apparently obvious fact that we do in fact take an\ninterest in the preservation of beautiful objects (see for example\nCrawford 1974: 53). A different kind of objection, based on an appeal\nto the cognitive role of aesthetic judging, is made in Pillow\n2006.\n\nKant has also been criticized for a view that is taken to be a\nconsequence of the thesis that judgments of beauty are disinterested,\nnamely the view that aesthetic experience requires a special attitude\nof \u201cpsychical distance\u201d or \u201cdetachment\u201d from\nthe object appreciated: this criticism is generally taken to be\nimplicit in Dickie\u2019s well-known (1964) discussion of the\n\u201cmyth of the aesthetic attitude\u201d. Zangwill (1992) argues\nthat this criticism is misplaced.\n\nKant\u2019s view that the pleasure in a beautiful object is\nnon-conceptual has been taken to commit him to the supposedly\nobjectionable view that the capacity to make conceptual distinctions\ncan play no role in the appreciation of beauty. This criticism, made\nby Wollheim (1980) (invoking the idea that aesthetic appreciation\ndemands an \u201cempty cognitive stock\u201d) is addressed in\nJanaway 1997. Relatedly, it has been objected that Kant does not allow\nroom for reason-giving, and more generally, criticism in aesthetics;\nthat objection is addressed in Crawford 1970 and (on lines suggested\nby Crawford) in Wilson 2007. Further defence and explication of a\nKantian approach to art criticism is offered in Tuna 2016.\n\nBaz (2005) criticizes Kant for his apparent view that the value of\nbeauty lies in its relation to cognition, rather than the beautiful\nobject\u2019s mattering for its own sake; Hughes (2006) offers a\nresponse.\n",
