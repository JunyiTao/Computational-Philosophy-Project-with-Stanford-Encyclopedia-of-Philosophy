    "main_text": "Ignore Small Probabilities?\n5. Ignore Small Probabilities?\n\nBuffon argued in 1777 that a rational decision maker should disregard\nthe possibility of winning lots of money in the St. Petersburg game\nbecause the probability of doing so is very low. According to Buffon,\nsome sufficiently improbable outcomes are \u201cmorally\nimpossible\u201d and should therefore be ignored. From a technical\npoint of view, this solution is very simple: The St. Petersburg\nparadox arises because the decision maker is willing to aggregate\ninfinitely many extremely valuable but highly improbable outcomes, so\nif we restrict the set of \u201cpossible\u201d outcomes by excluding\nsufficiently improbable ones the expected utility will, of course, be\nfinite.\n\nBut why should small probabilities be ignored? And how do we\ndraw the line between small probabilities that are beyond concern and\nothers that are not? Dutka summarizes Buffon\u2019s lengthy answer as\nfollows:\n\n\nTo arrive at a suitable threshold value, [Buffon] notes that a\nfifty-six year old man, believing his health to be good, would\ndisregard the probability that he would die within twenty-four hours,\nalthough mortality tables indicate that the odds against his dying in\nthis period are only 10189 to 1. Buffon thus takes a probability of\n1/10,000 or less for an event as a probability which may be\ndisregarded. (Dutka 1988: 33)\n\n\nIs this a convincing argument? According to Buffon, we ought\nto ignore some small probabilities because people like him\n(56-year-old males) do in fact ignore them. Buffon can thus\nbe accused of attempting to derive an \u201cought\u201d from an\n\u201cis\u201d. To avoid Hume\u2019s no-ought-from-an-is objection,\nBuffon would have to add a premise to the effect that people\u2019s\neveryday reactions to risk are always rational. But why should we\naccept such a premise?\n\nAnother objection is that if we ignore small probabilities, then we\nwill sometimes have to ignore all possible outcomes of an\nevent. Consider the following example: A regular deck of cards has 52\ncards, so it can be arranged in exactly 52! different ways. The\nprobability of any given arrangement is thus about 1 in \\(8 \\cdot\n10^{67}\\). This is a very small probability. (If one were to add six\ncards to the deck, then the number of possible orderings would exceed\nthe number of atoms in the known, observable universe.) However, every\ntime we shuffle a deck of cards, we know that exactly one of the\npossible outcomes will materialize, so why should we ignore\nall such very improbable outcomes?\n\nNicholas J. J. Smith (2014) defends a modern version of Buffon\u2019s\nsolution. He bases his argument on the following principle:\n\n\nRationally negligible probabilities (RNP): For any\nlottery featuring in any decision problem faced by any agent, there is\nan \\(\\epsilon > 0\\) such that the agent need not consider outcomes\nof that lottery of probability less than \\(\\epsilon\\) incoming to a\nfully rational decision. (Smith 2014: 472)\n\n\n\nSmith points out that the order of the quantifiers in RNP is crucial.\nThe claim is that for every lottery there exists some probability\nthreshold \\(\\epsilon\\) below which all probabilities should be\nignored, but it would be a mistake to think that one and the same\n\\(\\epsilon\\) is applicable to every lottery. This is important because\notherwise we could argue that RNP allows us to combine thousands or\nmillions of separate events with a probability of less than\n\\(\\epsilon.\\) It would obviously make little sense to ignore, say,\nhalf a million one-in-a-million events. By keeping in mind that that\nthe appropriate \\(\\epsilon\\) may vary from case to case this worry can\nbe dismissed.\n\nSmith also points out that if we ignore probabilities less than\n\\(\\epsilon,\\) then we have to increase some other probabilities to\nensure that all probabilities sum up to one, as required by the\nprobability axioms (see\n section 1 in the entry on interpretations of probability).\n Smith proposes a principle for doing this in a systematic manner.\n\nHowever, why should we accept RNP? What is the\nargument for accepting this controversial principle apart\nfrom the fact that it would solve the St. Petersburg paradox?\nSmith\u2019s argument goes as follows:\n\n\nInfinite precision cannot be required: rather, in any given context,\nthere must be some finite tolerance\u2014some positive threshold such\nthat ignoring all outcomes whose probabilities lie below this\nthreshold counts as satisfying the norm\u2026. There is a norm of\ndecision theory which says to ignore outcomes whose probability is\nzero. Because this norm mentions a specific probability value (zero),\nit is the kind of norm where it makes sense to impose a tolerance:\nzero plus or minus \\(\\epsilon\\) (which becomes zero plus \\(\\epsilon,\\)\ngiven that probabilities are all between 0 and 1)\u2026 the idea\nbehind (RNP) is that in any actual context in which a decision is to\nbe made, one never needs to be infinitely precise in this\nway\u2014that it never matters. There is (for each decision problem,\neach lottery therein, and each agent) some threshold such that the\nagent would not be irrational if she simply ignored outcomes whose\nprobabilities lie below that threshold. (Smith 2014:\n472\u2013474)\n\n\nSuppose we accept the claim that infinite precision is not\nrequired in decision theory. This would entail, per\nSmith\u2019s argument, that it is rationally permissible to\nignore probabilities smaller than \\(\\epsilon\\). However, to ensure\nthat the decision maker never pays a fortune for playing the St.\nPetersburg game it seems that Smith would have to defend the stronger\nclaim that decision makers are rationally required to ignore\nsmall probabilities, i.e., that it is not permissible to not ignore\nthem. Decision makers who find themselves in agreement with\nSmith\u2019s view run a risk of paying a very large amount for\nplaying the St. Petersburg game without doing anything deemed to be\nirrational by RNP. This point is important because it is arguably more\ndifficult to show that decision makers are rationally\nrequired to avoid \u201cinfinite precision\u201d in decisions\nin which this is an attainable and fully realistic goal, such as the\nSt. Petersburg game. For a critique of RNP and a discussion of some\nrelated issues, see H\u00e1jek (2014).\n\nAnother objection to RNP has been proposed by Yoaav Isaacs (2016). He\nshows that RNP together with an additional principle endorsed by Smith\n(Weak Consistency) entail that the decision maker will sometimes take\narbitrarily much risk for arbitrarily little reward.\n\nLara Buchak (2013) proposes what is arguably a more elegant version of\nthis solution. Her suggestion is that we should assign exponentially\nless weight to small probabilities as we calculate an\noption\u2019s value. A possible weighting function r discussed\nby Buchak is \\(r(p) = p^2.\\) Her proposal is, thus, that if the\nprobability is \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\) that you win $8 in addition to what you\nalready have, and your utility of money increases linearly, then\ninstead of multiplying your gain in utility by \\(\\frac{1}{8},\\) you\nshould multiply it by \\((\\frac{1}{8})^2 =\\frac{1}{64}.\\) Moreover, if\nthe probability is \\(\\frac{1}{16}\\) that you win $16 in addition to\nwhat you already have, you should multiply your gain by\n\\(\\frac{1}{256},\\) and so on. This means that small probabilities\ncontribute very little to the risk-weighted expected\nutility.\n\nBuchak\u2019s proposal vaguely resembles the familiar idea that our\nmarginal utility of money is decreasing. As stressed by Cram\u00e9r\nand Daniel Bernoulli, more money is always better than less, but the\nutility gained from each extra dollar is decreasing. According to\nBuchak, the weight we should assign to an outcome\u2019s probability\nis also nonlinear: Small probabilities matter less the smaller they\nare, and their relative importance decrease exponentially:\n\n\nThe intuition behind the diminishing marginal utility analysis of risk\naversion was that adding money to an outcome is of less value the more\nmoney the outcome already contains. The intuition behind the present\nanalysis of risk aversion is that adding probability to an outcome is\nof more value the more likely that outcome already is to obtain.\n(Buchak 2014: 1099.)\n\n\nBuchak notes that this move does not by itself solve the St.\nPetersburg paradox. For reasons that are similar to those Menger (1934\n[1979]) mentions in his comment on Bernoulli\u2019s solution, the\nparadox can be reintroduced by adjusting the outcomes such that the\nsum increases linearly (for details, see Buchak 2013: 73\u201374).\nBuchak is, for this reason, also committed to RNP, i.e., the\ncontroversial assumption that there will be some probability so small\nthat it does not make any difference to the overall value of the\ngamble.\n\nAnother worry is that because Buchak rejects the principle of\nmaximizing expected utility and replaces it with the principle of\nrisk-weighted maximizing expected utility, many of the stock\nobjections decision theorists have raised against violations of the\nexpected utility principle can be raised against her principle as\nwell. For instance, if you accept the principle of risk-weighted\nmaximizing expected utility, you have to reject the independence\naxiom. This entails that you can be exploited in some cleverly\ndesigned pragmatic argument. See Briggs (2015) for a discussion of\nsome objections to Buchak\u2019s theory.\n",
