    "main_text": "The Move to Mid-Level Theorizing: a Principles-Centered Approach || A Move Away from Deduction, and Reflective Equilibrium\n4.1 A Move Away from Deduction, and Reflective Equilibrium\n\nBeauchamp and Childress\u2019 approach has evolved since the\nbook\u2019s first edition, and one important aspect of this evolution\nis the move away from deductive reasoning, or (in other words) away\nfrom a \u201ctop down\u201d application of principles to cases.\nTheir initial take on the relation between moral theory, principles\nand cases was that\n\n\ntheory justified principles, that principles justified moral rules,\nand that rules justified moral judgments in particular cases. (Arras\n2017: 11)\n\n\nThis, at least, was the impression given by a diagram appearing in the\nfirst edition of the book (Beauchamp & Childress 1979: 5), which\nmany took to endorse such a top down model. The approach was met with\nresistance, with those in favor of case-based reasoning (also known as\ncasuistry) objecting to what at least appeared to be a unidirectional\nmovement from principles to cases. Intuitive, case-based judgments\nseemed to be left out of the picture, and the possibility of a\ndialectical relationship between principles and our responses to cases\nignored. In fact, and as a result of an evolution of their approach,\nBeauchamp and Childress now fully ascribe to this position on the\nreciprocal relationship between our responses to cases and moral\nprinciples. This is evidenced by their current commitment to\nreflective equilibrium as the methodology of bioethics. Briefly,\nreflective equilibrium is a process by which our considered responses\nto actual cases influence our moral principles, and those\nimproved-upon principles then provide enhanced guidance for our\nresponse to further cases. This is a way of doing moral philosophy\noriginally formulated by Rawls (Rawls 1971: 48\u201351; Daniels 1979;\nArras 2007: 47). Cases and principles work in tandem, then, as opposed\nto moral principles being applied deductively to cases. A distinction\nis made between narrow and wide reflective equilibrium. Narrow\nreflective equilibrium involves interplay between our responses (or\nintuitions) about cases and the moral principles used to structure\nsuch intuitions, as explained above, where wide reflective equilibrium\nbrings in additional moral and social theories. Beauchamp and\nChildress endorse wide reflective equilibrium (Arras 2017: 182).\n\nThat Beauchamp and Childress take (wide) reflective equilibrium to be\nsuch a crucial component of their approach is an important aspect of\ntheir approach as it currently stands. As their view has evolved over\nsubsequent editions of PBE, reflective equilibrium has grown to have a\nmore and more prominent role. An important result of this embrace of\nreflective equilibrium is that, paired with Beauchamp and\nChildress\u2019 appeal to the common morality, we have a hybrid\napproach to justification, hybrid in the sense of embracing both\ncoherentism and foundationalism. Reflective equilibrium is the source\nof coherentism, with the appeal to the common morality meant to\nprovide a foundation. Before moving on to a closer look at the notion\nof the common morality, we should note that this hybrid approach\ndiffers from accounts of reflective equilibrium we might find in\npolitical theory, for example, and in other areas of practical ethics.\nThose more standard accounts involve achieving moral justification by\nbringing the various elements of our moral reflection into contact\nwith one another, with none of these elements regarded as foundational\nand all of them regarded as open to revision. By contrast, Beauchamp\nand Childress accord foundational status to the common morality, and\nit is the common morality that underwrites their four principles.\n",
