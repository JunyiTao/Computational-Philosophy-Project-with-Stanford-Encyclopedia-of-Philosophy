    "main_text": "Equality of Condition: Equality of What? || Capabilities\n3.4 Capabilities\n\n\nOne response to the problematic features of the monetary equality\nideal is to shift to the notion of real freedom as that which an\negalitarian morality should be concerned to equalize. Real or effective\nfreedom contrasts with formal freedom. You are formally free to go to\nCanada just in case no law or convention backed by penalties prevents\nyou from going and no one would coercively interfere if you attempted\nto travel there. In contrast, you are really or effectively free to go\nto Canada just in case this is an option that you may choose\u2014if\nyou choose to go and seriously try to go, you will get there, and if\nyou do not choose to go and make a serious attempt to go, you do not\nget there. (One might lack formal freedom to do something yet be really\nfree to do it, if one was able to evade or overcome the legal and\nextralegal obstacles to doing that thing.)\n\n\nAnother response to the problematic features of the monetary\nequality ideal aims to cope with the thought that freedom of purchasing\npower may not be of great importance. The response is to characterize\nwhat we should be equalizing in terms that directly express what is\nreasonably regarded as truly important.\n\n\nBoth responses are present in a proposal made by Amartya Sen in\nseveral publications beginning in 1980 (see Sen 1980 and 1992 and the\nreferences cited in Sen 1992). Sen suggests that in so far as we should\nvalue equality of condition, what we should value is equal real\nfreedom, and more specifically basic functioning capability equality.\nPeople may function\u2014do or be something\u2014in any of a huge\nnumber of ways. Consider all of the different ways that one might\nfunction variously. Many of these are trivial or of little importance;\nset these to the side. Consider then basic functionings, functionings\nthat are essential or important for human flourishing or valuable\nagency. Consider all of the packages of functionings that an individual\nat a time is really free to choose all at once; these are one's\ncapabilities at a time. We may also consider an individual's basic\ncapabilities over the life course. The proposal is that society should\nsustain basic capability equality. (Care must be taken in identifying\nan individual's capability sets, since what others choose may affect\nthe freedom one has. One may have the option of choosing the\nfunctioning of attending college, but only if not too many persons in\none's high school cohort make the same choice.)\n\n\nWe might construe \u201cbasic capability\u201d as picking out one of the\ncapabilities needed for a minimally decent life. For example, being\nable to obtain enjoyment in life and gain scientific knowledge that\nmeet threshold levels deemed \u201cgood enough\u201d suffice to give one basic\nenjoyment and basic knowledge capabilities. Above that threshold level\nfor each capability, differences in the level of capability that people\ncan attain do not signify\u2014they do not change the fact that\neveryone does or does not enjoy equal basic capabilities. To get equal\nbasic capability for everyone would be to get each person at or above\nthe threshold level for every one of the capabilities that are\nspecified to be necessary for a minimally decent or good enough life.\nSo understood, the basic capability proposal falls in the family of\nsufficientarian ideals; on which, see the section on \u201cSufficiency\u201d\nbelow.\n\n\nThe capability approach to equality can be developed in different\nways depending on how basic capabilities are identified.\n\n\nSome theorists have explored the capability approach by tying it to\nan objective account of human well-being or flourishing. The aim is to\nidentify all of the functionings needed for human flourishing. For each\nof these functionings, the ideal is that each person should be\nsustained in the capability to engage in every one of these\nfunctionings at a satisfactory or good enough level. (See Nussbaum\n1990, 1992, and 1999.)\n\n\nAnother use of the capability approach ties it to the idea of what\nis needed for each person to function as a full participating member of\nmodern democratic society. Each person is to be sustained throughout\nher life, so far as this is feasible, in the capabilities to function\nat a satisfactory level in all of the ways necessary for full\nmembership and participation in democratic society. (See Anderson 1999\nand Walzer 1983.)\n\n\nIt should be noted that the capability approach as described so far\nmight seem to involve the assumption that anything whatever that\nreduces or expands an individual's real freedom to function in ways\nthat are valuable should trigger a response on the part of a society or\nagency that aims to establish and sustain capability equality. This\nappearance is misleading in at least two different ways. For one thing,\nSen clearly wants to allow that one's capabilities can increase\nby virtue of gaining opportunities to function even though one does not\nget real freedom to accept or decline the opportunities. Consider the\ncapability to be free of malaria, which opens many malaria-free life\noptions, when the capability is obtained by public health measures\nbeyond the power of the individual agent to control. Also, if what one\nembraces is basic capability equality for all, then by implication one\nis countenancing that there may be non-basic capabilities, providing\nwhich to all is not required. But even if we amend our conception of\ncapabilities to accommodate these points, one might still deny\nthat every reduction or threat to an individual's (basic)\ncapabilities poses a social justice issue while otherwise working\nwithin the capability framework.\n\n\nOne might distinguish aspects of a person's situation that are\nsocially caused from those that are naturally caused. This distinction\nis evidently rough and needs refinement, but one has some sense of what\nis intended. That I am unable to run fast or sing a tune on key may be\nlargely due to my genetic endowment, which in this context we may take\nto be naturally rather than socially caused. In contrast, the facts\nthat given the talents of others and their choices to use them in\nmarket interaction, my running ability is nonmarketable but my singing\nability enables me to have a career as a professional singer are deemed\nsocially caused. That I have a certain physical appearance is natural\n(any of a wide variety of childrearing regimens would have produced\npretty much this same physical appearance) but that my appearance\nrenders me ineligible for marriage or romantic liaisons is a social\nfact (social arrangements bring this about and different social\narrangements might undo it). Even if my natural physical appearance\nrepels any marital or romantic partners I might seek, society might\nprovide me charm lessons or cosmetic surgery or promulgate an\negalitarian norm that encourages the charming and the physically\nattractive not to shun my company (or institute some mix of these three\nstrategies or some others).\n\n\nHowever exactly the natural and social are distinguished, one might\nrestrict the scope of an equality ideal to the smoothing out of\nsocially caused inequalities. As Elizabeth Anderson remarks, \u201cThe\nproper negative aim of egalitarian justice is not to eliminate the\nimpact of brute luck from human affairs, but to end oppression, which\nby definition is socially imposed\u201d (Anderson 1999, 288). What this\nrestriction amounts to depends on how one distinguishes socially caused\nfrom other inequalities. Suppose that society pursues policy A, and\nthat if it pursued policy B instead, a given inequality across people\nwould disappear. Does this fact suffice to qualify the inequality as\nsocially caused or not?\n\n\nCritics of the capability approach home in on three of its features.\n\n\nThe starting point of the capability approach is that the equality\nthat matters morality or that we are morally required to sustain is\nequality of freedom of some sort. This starting point is open to\nchallenge. Freedom is no doubt important as a means to many other\ngoods and as something everyone cares about to some considerable\nextent. But why confine the concern of equality to freedom rather than\nto achieved outcomes? Suppose that we could supply resources to Smith\nthat will expand her freedom to achieve outcomes she has good reason\nto value, but we happen to know that this freedom will do nobody any\ngood. She will neglect it and it will be wasted. In these\ncircumstances, why supply the resources? If provision of freedom for\nits own sake is morally of first-priority importance, then the fact\nthat freedom in this instance will do nobody any good would seem to be\nan irrelevant consideration. If this fact seems highly pertinent to\nwhat we should do, this indicates that freedom may not be the ultimate\nvalue the distribution of which is the proper concern of an equality\nideal. (A version of this objection can be lodged by advocates of any\ntype of doctrine of equality of outcome against any type of doctrine\nof equal opportunity for outcomes.)\n\n\nAnother feature of the capability approach as elaborated to this point\nis that it does not appear to register the significance of personal\nresponsibility as it might appropriately qualify the formulation of an\nequality ideal (Roemer 1996 and 1998). A simple example illustrates\nthe difficulty. Suppose society is dedicated to sustaining all of its\nmembers equally at some level of basic capability. Society provides\nresources fully adequate for sustaining an individual at this level of\nbasic capability, but he frivolously and negligently squanders the\nresources. The resources are re-supplied, and squandered again, and\nthe cycle continues. At some point in the cycle, many people would\nurge that the responsibility of society has been fulfilled, and that\nit is the individual's responsibility to use provided resources in\nreasonable ways, if his lack of adequate basic capability is to\nwarrant a claim to equality-restoring social intervention. The\ncapability approach could of course be modified to accommodate\nresponsibility concerns. But it will be useful to turn to\nconsideration of the resourcist approach, within which the aim of\nintegrating equality and responsibility has prompted various\nproposals.\n \n\nA third feature of the capability approach that has elicited\ncriticism is the idea that knowledge of human flourishing and what\nfacilitates it must inform the identification of an adequate equality\nnorm. The worry in a nutshell is that in modern societies that secure\nwide freedoms, people will embrace many opposed conceptions of how to\nlive and of what is choiceworthy in human life. These are matters\nabout which we must agree to disagree. At least if an ideal of\nequality is being constructed to serve in a public conception of\njustice that establishes basic terms of morality for a modern\ndemocratic society, this ideal must eschew controversial claims about\nhuman good and human flourishing such as those in which the capability\napproach must become embroiled. Martha Nussbaum explores how the\ncapability approach to social equality might function appropriately as\na public conception of justice (Nussbaum 2000). Charles Larmore argues\nthat it is wrong for government to impose a policy that could only be\njustified by appeal to the claim that some controversial conception of\nthe good is superior to another (Larmore 1987 and 1996; for criticism\nof the neutrality requirement, see Raz 1986 and Sher 1997). In\nresponse it might be urged that a conception of human capabilities\nmight be controversial but true and, if known to be true,\nappropriately imposed by government policy.\n",
