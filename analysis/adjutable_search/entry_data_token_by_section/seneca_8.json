    "main_text": "Virtue || The Good\n4.3 The Good\n\nIn Letter 120, Seneca explains how we arrive at the notion of\nthe good. This question is a much-discussed topic in Stoic ethics. The\nStoics hold that, in the process of growing up, human beings acquire\nrationality, which importantly consists in acquiring preconceptions\n(prol\u00eapseis). Once a human being has reason in this\nminimal sense, she can improve and eventually perfect her rationality.\nAs part of this process she comes to acquire the concept of the good.\nThe transitional moment in which a human being finally and fully\nrecognizes that only virtue (consistency) is good is momentous: this\nis the moment in which a fool becomes a wise person (Cicero, De\nfin. 3.20\u201322). At that point, a human being acquires what\nwe might call the scientific concept of the good. She now masters a\nconcept of the good that gets things right\u2014once one has this\nconcept, one is not going to fall back on misguided ideas such as\n\u2018money brings happiness\u2019. But does it not seem that we\nhave a notion of the good before, eventually, turning into wise\npeople, if we do? We here must distinguish two notions. First, human\nbeings have a preconception of the good\u2014we call things good\nbefore understanding any of the truths of Stoic philosophy. But\nsecond, we might, as progressors, also come to see the point of the\nStoic claim that only virtue is good, without yet being fully able to\nconsistently appreciate its truth in our lives. As we have seen, it is\nthis condition of the progressor that Seneca has in mind as the\nobjective he hopes to achieve in many of his writings.\n\nLetter 120 seems to contribute to Stoic thought about the\nacquisition of the concept of the good in precisely this fashion.\nUnlike Cicero, Seneca does not discuss the transitional moment in\nwhich an agent becomes wise. Rather, he discusses how we come to\nunderstand what the Stoics are talking about when they say that only\nvirtue is good (supposing that neither we nor those we live with\nare virtuous). When reading about great deeds, we magnify the\nvirtuous features of the agents, and minimize their negative features\n(Inwood, 2005 [10]; Hadot 2014 replies to Inwood). By these and\nsimilar cognitive operations, we arrive at an understanding of what\nvirtue would actually be. This realization enables us to see\nvirtue\u2019s goodness without having encountered a real-life\ninstance of virtue (for the Stoics, the fully wise are rarely or never\nencountered).\n",
