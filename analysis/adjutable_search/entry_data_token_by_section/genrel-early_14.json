In Einstein\u2019s theory, the fundamental or\n\u201cmetric\u201d tensor \\(g_{\\mu\\nu}\\) of Riemannian geometry\nappears in a dual role which thoroughly fuses its geometrical and its\nphysical meanings. As is apparent from the expression for the\ndifferential interval between neighboring spacetime events,\n\\(\\textit{ds}^{2}= g_{\\mu\\nu} \\textit{dx}^{\\mu} \\textit{dx}^{\\nu}\\)\n(here, and below there is an implicit summation over repeated upper\nand lower indices), the metric tensor is at once the geometrical\nquantity underlying measurable metrical relations of lengths and\ntimes. In this role it ties a mathematical theory of events in\nfour-dimensional curved spacetime to observations and measurements in\nspace and time. But it is also the potential of the gravitational (or\n\u201cmetrical\u201d) field whose value, at any point of spacetime\narises as a solution of the Einstein Field Equations (see below) for\ngiven physical quantities of mass-momentum-stress in the immediate\nsurrounding region. In the new view, the idea of strength of\ngravitational force is replaced by that of degree of spacetime\ncurvature. This curvature is manifested, for example, by the tidal\nforce of the Earth\u2019s gravitational field that occasions two\nfreely falling bodies, released at a certain height and at fixed\nseparation, to approach one another. A freely falling body (ideally,\nan uncharged test particle of negligible mass) in a gravitational\nfield follows a geodesic path (that is, a curve of extremal length in\na generally curved pseudo-Riemannian spacetime). The body is no longer\nto be regarded as moving through space according to the pull of an\nattractive gravitational force, but simply as tracing out the laziest\n(longest or slowest possible) four-dimensional trajectory between two\nfinitely separated spacetime events. In consequence, in general\nrelativity the equation of motion of a free body is a geodesic\nequation according to which the body\u2019s spacetime (four-)\nacceleration vanishes identically and its free fall becomes\nindistinguishable from inertial motion. According to this equation, a\nfree body moves on a geodesic path in both the presence and\nabsence of a gravitational field. This is possible because\nthe equation contains a multi-index term (not a tensor) called a\nconnection allowing a gravitational field to appear or not\naccording to a given choice of spacetime coordinates. As a result, in\ngeneral relativity there is no observer-independent (coordinate-free)\nway to partition the combined inertial-gravitational field into its\nseparate components. The gross mechanical properties of bodies,\ncomprising all gravitational-inertial phenomena, can be derived as the\nsolution of a single linked system of ten generally covariant partial\ndifferential equations, the Einstein equations. According to these\nequations, spacetime and matter stand in dynamical interaction. One\nabbreviate way of characterizing the dual role of the \\(g_{\\mu\\nu}\\)\nis to say that in the general theory of relativity, gravitation, which\nincludes mechanics, has become geometrized, i.e.,\nincorporated into the geometry of spacetime. Yet Einstein objected to\nclaims that in general relativity gravitation is reduced to\ngeometry as that statement\u2019s natural interpretation severs the\nunification of inertia and gravitation that to Einstein comprised the\ntheory\u2019s core achievement.\n",
