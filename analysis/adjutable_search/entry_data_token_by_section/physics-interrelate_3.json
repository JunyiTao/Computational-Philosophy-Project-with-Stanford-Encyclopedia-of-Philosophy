    "main_text": "Hierarchies of Theories\n4. Intertheory Relations\n\n\nIt seems reasonable to expect something like philosophical\nreductions to be possible in those situations where Schema\nR holds. On the other hand, neither philosophical nor\n\u201cphysical\u201d reduction seems possible when the limiting correspondence\nrelation between the theories is singular. Perhaps in such cases it is\nbest to speak simply of intertheoretic relations rather than\nreductions. It is here that much of philosophical and physical interest\nis to be found. This claim and the following discussion should not be\ntaken to be anything like the received view among philosophers of\nscience. Instead, they reflect the views of the author.\n\n\nNevertheless, here is a passage from a recent paper by Michael Berry\nwhich expresses a similar point of view.\n\n\nEven within physical science, reduction between different\nlevels of explanation is problematic\u2014indeed, it is almost always\nso. Chemistry is supposed to have been reduced to quantum mechanics,\nyet people still argue over the basic question of how quantum\nmechanics can describe the shape of a molecule. The statistical\nmechanics of a fluid reduces to its thermodynamics in the limit of\ninfinitely many particles, yet that limit breaks down near the\ncritical point, where liquid and vapour merge, and where we never see\na continuum no matter how distantly we observe the particles\n\u2026\u00a0. The geometrical (Newtonian) optics of rays should be\nthe limit of wave optics as the wavelength becomes negligibly small,\nyet \u2026 the reduction (mathematically similar to that of\nclassical to quantum mechanics) is obstructed by singularities\n\u2026\u00a0.\n\nMy contention \u2026 will be that many difficulties associated\nwith reduction arise because they involve singular limits.\nThese singularities have both negative and positive aspects: they\nobstruct the smooth reduction of more general theories to less general\nones, but they also point to a great richness of borderland physics\nbetween theories. (Berry 2001, 43)\n\n\n\nWhen Schema R fails this is because the mathematics\nof the particular limit \\((\\varepsilon \\rightarrow 0)\\) is singular. One can ask\nwhat, physically, is responsible for this mathematical singularity. In\ninvestigating the answer to this question one will often find that the\nmathematical blow-up reflects a physical impossibility. For instance,\nif Schema R held when \\(T_f\\)\nis the wave theory of light and \\(T_c\\) is the\nray theory (geometrical optics), then one would expect to recover rays\nin the shortwave limit \\(\\lambda \\rightarrow 0\\) of the wave theory. On the ray\ntheory, rays are the carriers of energy. But in certain situations\nfamilies of rays can focus on surfaces or lines called \u201ccaustics.\u201d\nThese are not strange esoteric situations. In fact, rainbows are, to a\nfirst approximation, described by the focusing of sunlight on these\nsurfaces following its refraction and reflection through raindrops.\nHowever, according to the ray theory, the intensity of the light on\nthese focusing surfaces would be infinite. This is part of the\nphysical reason for the mathematical singularities. See also the discussion of the rainbow by Pincock 2011, and Belot 2005.\n\n\nOne is led to study the asymptotic domain in which the parameter\n\\(\\varepsilon\\) in Schema R approaches 0. In the example\nabove, this is the short wavelength limit. Michael Berry (1980; 1990;\n1994a; 1994b) has done much research on this and other asymptotic\ndomains. He has found that in the asymptotic borderlands between such\ntheories there emerge phenomena whose explanation requires in some\nsense appeal to a third intermediate theory. This is a claim\n(Batterman 2002) that when taken literally, has raised a number of\nhackles in the literature. However, understood in terms of the\nmathematics of characteristics and wavefronts, as was originally\nintended, the current author believes some of the debates are\nmisdirected. The emergent structures (the rainbow itself is one of\nthem) are not fully explainable either in terms of the finer wave\ntheory or in terms of the ray theory alone. Instead, aspects of both\ntheories (through asymptotic investigation of the wave equations) are\nrequired for a full understanding of these emergent phenomena. \n\n\nThis fact calls into question certain received views about the nature\nof intertheoretic relations. The wave theory, for example, is surely\nthe fundamental theory. Nevertheless, these considerations seem to\nshow that that theory is itself explanatorily deficient. There are\nphenomena within its scope whose explanations require examining\nthe asymptotics of the appropriate equation. This involves\npaying attention to mathematical structures called characteristics and\nwavefronts. See B\u00f3na and Slawinski 2011. These mathematical\ninvestigations of the deep asymptotic structure of hyperbolic\nequations are not at all like the straightforward derivations from\ninitial data that are typical of in principle derivations\noften referred to in carrying out the dictates of Nagel style\nexplanatory reductions. A similar situation arises in the asymptotic\ndomain between quantum mechanics and classical mechanics where\nPlanck\u2019s constant can be considered asymptotically small. (See Belot\n2005 for an alternative point of view.)\n\nThere is much here worthy of further philosophical study. Some very\nrecent work by Butterfield (2011), Butterfield and Bouatta (2011),\nNorton (2012), Menon and Callender (2012) challenges the point of view\nsuggested by the above discussion. These authors address issues about\nthe nature of infinite idealizations, reduction, and emergence. A\ncommon theme is that it is possible to reconcile emergence and\nreduction. By and large these authors adopt a Nagelian sense of\nreduction as definitional extension. For a contrary point of view one\ncan see Batterman (2002; 2012).\n\n",
