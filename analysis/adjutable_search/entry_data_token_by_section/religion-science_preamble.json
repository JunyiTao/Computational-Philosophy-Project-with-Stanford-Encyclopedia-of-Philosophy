    "main_text": "\n\nThe relationship between religion and science is the subject of\ncontinued debate in philosophy and theology. To what extent are\nreligion and science compatible? Are religious beliefs sometimes\nconducive to science, or do they inevitably pose obstacles to\nscientific inquiry? The interdisciplinary field of \u201cscience and\nreligion\u201d, also called \u201ctheology and science\u201d, aims\nto answer these and other questions. It studies historical and\ncontemporary interactions between these fields, and provides\nphilosophical analyses of how they interrelate.\n\nThis entry provides an overview of the topics and discussions in\nscience and religion. Section 1 outlines the scope of both fields, and\nhow they are related. Section 2 looks at the relationship between\nscience and religion in five religious traditions, Christianity,\nIslam, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Judaism. Section 3 discusses\ncontemporary topics of scientific inquiry in which science and\nreligion intersect, focusing on divine action, creation, and human\norigins.\n",
