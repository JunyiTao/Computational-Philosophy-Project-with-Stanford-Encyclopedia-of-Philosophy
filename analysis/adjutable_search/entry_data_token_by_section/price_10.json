    "main_text": "Perception || Perceptual Consciousness: Perceptual Acceptance\n3.4 Perceptual Consciousness: Perceptual Acceptance\n\nPrice (1932: ch. 6) discusses what he calls \u201cperceptual\nconsciousness\u201d, that is, what the perceiver takes to be there.\nHis example is when a perceiver takes in that there is a tree in front\nof them. Price\u2019s method is to describe as accurately as he can\nthe component in perception that he calls perceptual\nacceptance. His project is a phenomenological analysis (Passmore\n[1957: 255] ties Price\u2019s work with Husserl\u2019s). Acceptance\ndoes not count as knowledge, since it can be present when the\npercipient is mistaken, as when a drunk hallucinates a large pink\nrabbit that frightens him. It isn\u2019t belief either but perhaps\nthe \u201cabsence of disbelief\u201d (1932: 142), since, according\nto him (following Cook Wilson; for discussion: Passmore 1957:\n254\u2013255), beliefs are a state of mind which must be arrived at\nby inference from evidence that the subject recognises is less than\nconclusive. Price says that there is no inference or weighing of\nevidence in basic perceptual consciousness. Both these claims, that it\ncannot be knowledge or belief, rest on questionable assumptions.\n\nO\u2019Shea (2007: 210) takes Price to be relating\n\u201c(non-propositional) sensing and (propositional)\nperceiving\u201d here. Martin (2000: 210) claims that Price\u2019s\nperceptual acceptance is what he calls \u201cthe intentionality of\nperceptual experience\u201d and takes Price explicitly to consider it\na \u201cbelief-like state of mind\u201d. Butchvarov (1979: 93) calls\nPrice\u2019s perceptual consciousness, \u201csingling out in\nperception of a material thing, which may but need not\nexist\u201d.\n\nPrice\u2019s analysis attempts to capture the nature of very basic\nperceptual acceptance: as subjects\u2019 experiences grow this sets\nup in the subjects dispositions for the sensing of a certain type of\nsense-datum to produce acceptance of much more complex claims as to\nwhat is there. These dispositions represent part of the subject\nlearning about the world. Price is claiming that these are simply\nacceptances with richer content.\n\nPrice argues that acceptance is not the generation of a bodily\ndisposition relating to the environment, for it is also related\nto an ability to report what is there, not simply to adopt a\nbehavioural response\u2014nor is it reducible to an emotional\nresponse (1932: 156ff). Rather, acceptance is a basic attitude,\ninvolving concepts, which our psychological nature endows us with\n(1932: 168f). His work on perception doesn\u2019t explain what it is\nfor these states to involve concepts, nor what this explains: we are\nsimply set up to form attitudes when undergoing sensings of\nsense-data, though he holds that the most basic concepts involved in\nacceptance are innate and not derived from experience. However, later\n(1953a), he develops a theory of concepts as recognitional capacities,\nwhich suggests that perceptual acceptance involves a recognitional\ncapacity developed by perceiving and derived from experience.\n",
