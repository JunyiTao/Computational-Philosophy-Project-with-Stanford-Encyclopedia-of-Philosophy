    "main_text": "Applications || Artificial Intelligence\n5. Conclusion\n\nAutomated reasoning is a growing field that provides a healthy\ninterplay between basic research and application. Automated deduction\nis being conducted using a multiplicity of theorem-proving methods,\nincluding resolution, sequent calculi, natural deduction, matrix\nconnection methods, term rewriting, mathematical induction, and\nothers. These methods are implemented using a variety of logic\nformalisms such as first-order logic, type theory and higher-order\nlogic, clause and Horn logic, non-classical logics, and so on.\nAutomated reasoning programs are being applied to solve a growing\nnumber of problems in formal logic, mathematics and computer science,\nlogic programming, software and hardware verification, circuit design,\nexact philosophy, and many others. One of the results of this variety\nof formalisms and automated deduction methods has been the\nproliferation of a large number of theorem proving programs. To test\nthe capabilities of these different programs, selections of problems\nhave been proposed against which their performance can be measured\n(McCharen, Overbeek & Wos 1976, Pelletier 1986). The TPTP\n(Sutcliffe & Suttner 1998) is a library of such problems that is\nupdated on a regular basis. There is also a competition among\nautomated theorem provers held regularly at the CADE conference\n(Pelletier, Sutcliffe & Suttner 2002; Sutcliffe 2016, in Other\nInternet Resources); the problems for the competition are selected\nfrom the TPTP library. There is a similar library and competition for\nSMT solvers (Barret et al. 2013).\n\nInitially, computers were used to aid scientists with their complex\nand often tedious numerical calculations. The power of the machines\nwas then extended from the numeric into the symbolic domain where\ninfinite-precision computations performed by computer algebra programs\nhave become an everyday affair. The goal of automated reasoning has\nbeen to further extend the machine\u2019s reach into the realm of deduction\nwhere they can be used as reasoning assistants in helping their users\nestablish truth through proof.\n",
