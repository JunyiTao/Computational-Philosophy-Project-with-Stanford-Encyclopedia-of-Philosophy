    "main_text": "\n\nDemocritus, known in antiquity as the \u2018laughing\nphilosopher\u2019 because of his emphasis on the value of\n\u2018cheerfulness,\u2019 was one of the two founders of ancient\natomist theory. He elaborated a system originated by his teacher\nLeucippus into a materialist account of the natural world. The\natomists held that there are smallest indivisible bodies from which\neverything else is composed, and that these move about in an infinite\nvoid. Of the ancient materialist accounts of the natural world which\ndid not rely on some kind of teleology or purpose to account for the\napparent order and regularity found in the world, atomism was the most\ninfluential. Even its chief critic, Aristotle, praised Democritus for\narguing from sound considerations appropriate to natural\nphilosophy.\n",
