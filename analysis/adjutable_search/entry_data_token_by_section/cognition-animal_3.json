    "main_text": "Philosophical Assumptions in the Study of Animal Cognition || Value-ladenness\n2.2 Value-ladenness\n\nPhilosophers of science have highlighted that scientific studies are\nalso value-laden, insofar as scientists\u2019 values shape how they\ndo their science and the data that it ultimately delivers. This is\nalso evident in the study of animal cognition. Values shape the choice\nof capacities to study. For example, during the twentieth century, a\ngreat deal of effort went into attempting to teach various forms of\nlinguistic communication to great apes, an endeavor that stems from\nthe value that humans place on language. Values also shape the methods\nthat scientists use. Experimental evidence coming from labs is often\nconsidered more valuable than observational evidence coming from field\nstudies, because the increase in ability to control the different\nvariables that can affect an animal\u2019s performance is thought to\ncompensate for the loss of ecological validity that comes with the\nhighly artificial experimental settings. Values also shape how\nscientists interpret the results of their studies. The data that an\nempirical study delivers is useless without an interpretation, and\nthis interpretation cannot be fully disentangled from the values\nupheld by scientists. This is because scientists have to choose which\nstatistical methods to apply, which theories to accept, and what\nnarrative they follow when writing up the results in a scientific\npaper.\n\nThe research on animal culture is another example of value-ladenness,\ngiven that the driving force behind it is a fascination with human\nculture, and an attempt to map out the cognitive differences between\nour own and the other ape species that can explain the origins of our\nuniqueness. This is why the negative results in experiments that have\ntested for great ape overimitation are described as a\n\u201cfailure\u201d on their behalf. However, by its very definition\noverimitation is the imitation of actions that are irrelevant to\nproducing the desired goal, so one could easily turn these results on\ntheir head and describe this as evidence that apes will go for the\nmore efficient solution to the problem, which children fail to do. The\nfact that these results are not described this way evidences a\nvalue-laden perspective, from which overimitation is seen as a\n\u201cdesirable\u201d capacity, insofar as it is linked to other\ncharacteristically human traits, such as rituals, normativity, and\ncumulative technologies.\n\nAnother good example of how the design of studies in comparative\ncognition is value-laden is the mirror self-recognition (MSR) test,\nwhich was originally envisioned by Gordon Gallup (1970) to probe\nanimals\u2019 self-awareness. In this test, an animal is first\nallowed to become familiarized with a mirror. In a second step, the\nanimal is anesthetized and an odorless mark is painted on their\nforehead. The behavior of the animal in front of the mirror is then\nobserved, to see whether they interact with the mark, which would be a\nsign that they understand that the individual in the mirror is\nthemself. Passing the MSR test is viewed as a sign of self-awareness,\nthough whether it shows awareness of one\u2019s own mind or just\none\u2019s body is disputed (Heyes 1994, 2008; Povinelli 1998).\nLeaving aside whether the MSR test actually addresses this capacity,\nwhich is an issue of theory-ladenness, we would like to draw attention\nto the methodology itself. As has long been argued, animals can fail\nthis test for reasons that have nothing to do with their lack of\nself-awareness. For instance, gorillas\u2019 failure to pass the test\nhas been linked to the fact that this species tends to avoid eye\ncontact with conspecifics, because it is considered a threat\n(Shillito, Gallup, & Beck 1999). Other species might fail the test\nbecause vision is not their primary sensory modality. Dogs, for\ninstance, fail the MSR test but pass an analogous olfactory test\n(Horowitz 2017). In this alternative, dogs are presented with urine\nsamples from themselves and other dogs. Results show that they spend\nless time sniffing their own urine marks, which evidences some form of\nolfactory self-recognition. For humans, however, vision is the primary\nand most cherished sensory modality and this often leads to study\ndesigns that, like the MSR test, are vision-centered. Joint attention,\nfor instance, is measured by means of gaze-following (Carpenter &\nCall 2013), which Maria Botero (2016) has criticized, arguing that for\nnonhuman primates touch might also be a medium for joint attention to\nemerge.\n\nDespite these problems, the MSR test is still treated as the gold\nstandard in the study of self-awareness, which illustrates the value\nthat humans place on visual self-recognition, and our failure to\nappreciate that other animals may recognize themselves through other\nsensory modalities. Additionally, the MSR test presupposes that the\nanimals tested care in some sense about their appearance.\nThis is a necessary requirement for them to be motivated to interact\nwith the mark. The fact that this is taken for granted in discussions\non the MSR test illustrates the importance that we grant to\nmirrors delivering our expected self-reflection. However, it is not\nimmediately obvious that all animals should care about this. Instead,\nwhether or not they do will likely be shaped by their particular\necology and evolutionary history. For example, a tiny fish, the\ncleaner wrasse, has been recently shown to pass the MSR test,\nattempting to scrape off the mark in the presence of a mirror and\nignoring it if it was colorless or there was no mirror available\n(Kohda et al. 2019). This initially surprising result becomes less so\nwhen one considers that this species of fish feeds off the parasites\nthat they visually detect on the skin of other fish, and the mark that\nwas planted on their head was intentionally made to mimic the color,\nsize, and shape of one of these parasites. In the cleaner\nwrasse\u2019s Umwelt, this mark is clearly something worth\nattending to, but it might not be the case for all species. Other\nanimals, for instance, might care much more if their coat smells in an\nunexpected way than if there is some debris on their head.\n\nFurther exemplifying value-ladenness, it is not uncommon for\nexperimental results in comparative psychology to be communicated in a\nway that depicts the human species as \u201csuperior,\u201d which\ncan be illustrated by some experiments that have compared chimpanzee\nperformance to our own. Daniel Povinelli and colleagues (1999), for\nexample, found that chimpanzees outperform children in a\ngaze-following task, but interpreted the children\u2019s poorer\nperformance as evidence of their possession of superior cognitive\ncapacities (see also Leavens, Bard, & Hopkins 2017). In this\nexperiment, the subjects had to follow the experimenter\u2019s gaze\nto find a reward, which both children and chimpanzees could do. In one\ncondition, however, the experimenter was oriented towards the reward\nbut gazing above it. While the chimpanzees could still use this gaze\nto find the reward, the children chose randomly in these trials.\nPovinelli et al. interpreted this as evidence that children, but not\nchimpanzees, have a theory of mind, which allowed the children to\ninterpret the above-target gaze as a distracted one that was not worth\nfollowing. From the chimpanzees\u2019 perspective, however, one could\nalso argue for their superiority in this task, since they were much\nmore successful than the children in actually finding the reward. In\nanother experiment (Jensen, Call, & Tomasello 2007), chimpanzees\nwere tested in an ultimatum game, where one chimpanzee (the proposer)\ncould choose how a reward was distributed among themself and another\nchimpanzee (the responder). The responder could either choose to\naccept the offer (in which case, they both kept it) or reject it\n(which would have meant they both lost it). The experimenters found\nthat the responder would always accept the offer, regardless of how\nunfair the distribution was, so long as their part was higher than\nzero. Chimpanzees behaved in the way that economic theory predicts of\nthe fully rational agent, in contrast to humans, who would typically\nrather be left with zero than accept an unfair distribution. Although\nthe researchers acknowledge this, they also make a point of\nhighlighting how these results illustrate that chimpanzees lack the\nsensitivity to fairness that characterizes (superior) human societies,\nthough they fail to consider that chimpanzees may have fairness norms\nin domains outside of food sharing. A further example of results being\ninterpreted to fit the narrative of human superiority comes from a\nstudy by Sana Inoue and Tetsuro Matsuzawa (2007), where a chimpanzee\nnamed Ayumu was found to strongly outperform humans in terms of speed\nand accuracy in a working memory task. Although in this paper the\nsuperiority of the chimp was acknowledged without caveats, one of the\nauthors (Matsuzawa 2010) later used these results to highlight the\nsuperior cognitive capacities of humans, arguing for the existence of\na trade-off between memory and abstraction in the phylogeny and\nontogeny of our species, such that by letting go of the photographic\nmemory that our ancestors likely shared with chimpanzees, we could\ndevelop our characteristic skills for complex representation and\nlanguage.\n",
