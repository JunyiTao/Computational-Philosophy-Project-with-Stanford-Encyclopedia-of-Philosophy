    "main_text": "\n\nThe term \u201ctoleration\u201d\u2014from the Latin\ntolerare: to put up with, countenance or\nsuffer\u2014generally refers to the conditional acceptance of or\nnon-interference with beliefs, actions or practices that one considers\nto be wrong but still \u201ctolerable,\u201d such that they should\nnot be prohibited or constrained. There are many contexts in which we\nspeak of a person or an institution as being tolerant: parents\ntolerate certain behavior of their children, a friend tolerates the\nweaknesses of another, a monarch tolerates dissent, a church tolerates\nhomosexuality, a state tolerates a minority religion, a society\ntolerates deviant behavior. Thus for any analysis of the motives and\nreasons for toleration, the relevant contexts need to be taken into\naccount.\n",
