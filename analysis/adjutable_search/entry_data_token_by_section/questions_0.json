    "main_text": "Preliminaries\n1. Preliminaries\n\nR.G. Collingwood (1939) was an early advocate of taking questions\nseriously. In the decades since the publication of Collingwood\u2019s\nautobiography the topic of questions has regularly received attention\nfrom linguists, logicians, and philosophers of language, but few have\njoined Collingwood (1939, 36\u201337) in suggesting that\npropositional logic be replaced by a logic of question and answer in\nwhich neither question nor proposition is more basic. Instead, most\nwork on questions in the philosophy of language and in formal\nsemantics fits squarely within a reductive paradigm inspired \nby (if not perfectly reflective of) Frege in which\npropositions, declarative sentences, and assertion have primacy. The\nprimacy of the assertoric is especially evident in the work of many\nwho write on the semantics of what Belnap and Steel (1976) call\nelementary questions and who regard any such question as being\nidentifiable with a set or function involving the propositions that\nare the question\u2019s answers. Only relatively recently, an\nalternative to this reductive paradigm, taking up\nCollingwood\u2019s suggestion to replace classical logic with a logic\nof questions and propositions in which neither question nor\nproposition is seen as more basic, has gained traction under the\nheading of inquisitive semantics (Ciardelli et al.\n2018).\n",
