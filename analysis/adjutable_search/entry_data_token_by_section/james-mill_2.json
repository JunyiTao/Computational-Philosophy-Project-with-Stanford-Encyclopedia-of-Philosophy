    "main_text": "Mill\u2019s Writings\n3. Mill\u2019s Writings\nJames Mill always attempted to write, he said, with \u201cmanly plainness,\u201d and in that endeavor he certainly succeeded. The reader is never at a loss to know just what his views are or where his sympathies lie. Mill\u2019s manly plainness is especially evident in his massive three-volume History of British India, which begins with a remarkable preface in which he asserts that his objectivity is guaranteed by the fact that he has never visited India. His is, he says, a \u201ccritical, or judging history,\u201d and his judgments on Hindu customs and practices are particularly harsh (Mill 1818, I, x). He denounces their \u201crude\u201d and \u201cbackward\u201d culture for its cultivation of ignorance and its veneration of superstition, and leaves no doubt that he favors a strong dose of Utilitarian rationalism as an antidote. Although his History is in part a Utilitarian treatise and in part a defense of British intervention in Indian affairs, it is more than the sum of those two parts. Mill\u2019s History shows, perhaps more clearly than any of his other works, the continuing influence of his Scottish education (Rendall, 1982). The criteria according to which Mill judges and criticizes Indian practices and customs derive from the view of historical progress that he had learned from Dugald Stewart and John Millar, amongst others. According to this view \u201cman is a progressive being\u201d and education is the chief engine of progress. And this in turn helps to explain not only Mill\u2019s harsh judgments on the Hindus but his continually reiterated emphasis on education (Mill 1992, 139\u201384).\nVirtually everything that James Mill ever wrote had a pedagogical purpose. He was a relentlessly didactic writer whose most important essays\u2014Government and Education, in particular\u2014take the form of clipped, concise, deductive arguments (De Marchi 1983). It is a style which his contemporaries either admired or detested, as can be seen for instance in F. D. Maurice\u2019s novel Eustace Conway. When the Benthamite Morton discovers Eustace reading Mill\u2019s Essay on Government, he asks his opinion of Mill. Eustace replies:\n\u201cI think him nearly the most wonderful prose-writer in our language.\u201d\n\u201cThat do not I,\u201d says Morton. \u201cI approve the matter of his treatises exceedingly, but the style seems to me detestable.\u201d\n\u201cOh!,\u201d says Eustace, \u201cI cannot separate matter and style \u2026 My reason for delighting in this book is, that it gives such a fixedness and reality to all that was most vaguely brilliant in my speculations\u2014it converts dreams into demonstrations\u201d (quoted in Thomas 1969, 255\u201356).\n\nMany of Mill\u2019s readers were not so gentle. Thomas Babington Macaulay criticized Mill and his fellow Utilitarians for \u201caffect[ing] a quakerly plainness, or rather a cynical negligence and impurity of style.\u201d In so doing,\nthey surrender their understandings \u2026 to the meanest and most abject sophisms, provided those sophisms come before them disguised with the externals of demonstration. They do not seem to know that logic has its illusions as well as rhetoric,\u2014that a fallacy may lurk in a syllogism as well as in a metaphor (Macaulay 1992, 272\u201373).\nBut if Mill\u2019s style of reasoning and writing was plain and unadorned, it was at least clear and cogent. And that, surely, is a virtue too often lacking among political theorists.\nAnd indeed James Mill regarded himself as a theorist, which was, for him, a title to be worn proudly. Theory, he wrote, gives a \u201ccommanding view\u201d of its subject and serves as a guide for improving practice. Theory precedes practice or \u201cexperience\u201d and is not simply derived from it. Amidst the often contradictory welter of appearance, theory functions a priori, serving as a reliable weather vane and guide (Mill 1992, 141). This view of theory is much in evidence in all his writings, and in his political essays in particular. The most important of these\u2014and the most controversial\u2014is Government.\n",
