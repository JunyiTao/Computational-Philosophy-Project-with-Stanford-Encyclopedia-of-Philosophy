    "main_text": "\n\nPatriotism raises questions of the sort philosophers\ncharacteristically discuss: How is patriotism to be defined? How is it\nrelated to similar attitudes, such as nationalism? What is its moral\nstanding: is it morally valuable or perhaps even mandatory, or is it\nrather a stance we should avoid? Yet until a few decades ago,\nphilosophers used to show next to no interest in the subject. The\narticle on patriotism in the Historical Dictionary of\nPhilosophy, reviewing the use of the term from the\n16th century to our own times, gives numerous references,\nbut they are mostly to authors who were not philosophers. Moreover, of\nthe few well known philosophers cited, only one, J. G. Fichte, gave\nthe subject more than a passing reference \u2013 and most of what\nFichte had to say actually pertains to nationalism, rather than\npatriotism (see Busch and Dierse 1989).\n\nThis changed in the 1980s. The change was due, in part, to the revival\nof communitarianism, which came in response to the individualistic,\nliberal political and moral philosophy epitomized by John Rawls\u2019\nTheory of Justice (1971); but it was also due to the\nresurgence of nationalism in several parts of the world. The beginning\nof this change was marked by Andrew Oldenquist\u2019s account of\nmorality as a matter of various loyalties, rather than abstract\nprinciples and ideals (Oldenquist 1982), and Alasdair\nMacIntyre\u2019s argument that patriotism is a central moral virtue\n(MacIntyre 1984). Largely in response to MacIntyre, some philosophers\nhave defended constrained or deflated versions of patriotism (Baron\n1989, Nathanson 1989, Primoratz 2002). Others have argued against\npatriotism of any sort (Gomberg 1990, McCabe 1997, Keller 2005). There\nis now a lively philosophical debate about the moral credentials of\npatriotism that shows no signs of abating. A parallel discussion in\npolitical philosophy concerns the kind of patriotism that might\nprovide an alternative to nationalism as the ethos of a stable,\nwell-functioning polity.\n",
