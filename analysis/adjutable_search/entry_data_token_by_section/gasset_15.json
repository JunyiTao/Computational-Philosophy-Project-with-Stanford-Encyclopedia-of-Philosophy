The Concept of Generation, Temporality, Historical Reason and Critical Philosophy of History\n\nThe social world and the conscious process of the individual, however,\ndisclose more than the experiences of other individuals that are\ndirectly given in the common, vivid present of the here-and-now. For\nOrtega, the social world also contains an implicit feature of social\nreality that remains inexperienced directly (in the broader sense of\nimmediate confrontation) by the individual\u2014in the\nhere-and-now\u2014but becomes contemporaneous with the life of the\nindividual and subsequently may be made available to him as an\nexperience in the future. Hence, the here-and-now of the individual,\nas an immediate direct experience, extends itself (both as a process\nof consciousness and as a perceptible factual occurrence in space)\ninto the broader social context of living and interacting as\n\u201ccontemporaries\u201d (Obras, V: 36\u201342). In this\ncontext, the explicit features of the social reality of\n\u201ccontemporaries\u201d reveal the conscious process of a\ngeneration of individuals as a temporal process.\n\nThe temporality of the lives of individuals (as\n\u201ccontemporaries\u201d and also as what Ortega called\n\u201ccoevals\u201d) is central to the concept of the generation. In\nthis sense, for Ortega, ultimate reality as the reality of human life\nalso signifies the explicit manifestation of time (for time is in man\nas the events of his life are connected to their placements in time)\nand thus provides him with the basic structure of his concept of\ngeneration and the basis of historic changes. The life of man, as\nbeing-in-the-making, is life as a happening, life as a changing\nstructure. With each fleeting moment of the here-and-now, man\u2019s inner\nstream of consciousness of the flow of time relates to the fact that\nhis life changes as he grows older and ages with each reference to the\nno-longer-here and the not-yet-here. \u201cThe most elemental fact of\nhuman life\u201d, he said,\n\n\nis that some men die and others are born\u2014that lives succeed each\nother. All human life, in its very essence, is enclosed in between\nother lives which came before or which are to come after\u2014it\nproceeds out of one life and goes into one which is to follow. Well\nthen, it is on this most fundamental fact that I establish the\ninevitable necessity of change in the structure of the world\u2026.\nThis is not to say, heedlessly, that the youth of today\u2014that is,\nhis soul and his body\u2014is different from the youth of yesterday;\nbut it is inevitable that his life should have a different framework\nthan that of yesterday.\n\nWell then, this is nothing but to find the reason and the period for\nhistorical changes in the fact joined essentially to human life, that\nthis human life always has an age [a period of time]. Life is\ntime\u2014as Dilthey already made us see and Heidegger repeats to us\ntoday; and not imaginary cosmic time because imaginary time is\ninfinite, but limited time, time which grows toward an end, which is\nthe true time, the irreparable time. For this reason man has age. Age\nis man\u2019s being always in a certain part of his limited\ntime-span\u2014whether it is to be the beginning of his vital life\u2019s\ntime, to be the ascension toward the middle, to be its center, or to\nbe approaching toward its end\u2014or, as one is accustomed to say,\nwhether he is a child, a youth, a mature man, or an old man.\n(Obras, V: 37)\n\n\nAfter having established this principle of change, Ortega\u2019s concept of\ngeneration becomes the principle through which the no-longer-here, the\nhere-and-now, and the not-yet-here converge in the temporal reality of\nthe social world. Thus, when Ortega referred to one\u2019s \u201clife\ntime\u201d as consisting youth, maturity and old age, we are able to\ndiscern that: in the first instance, his concept of generation entails\na horizontal reference to living individuals as being\n\u201ccontemporaries\u201d; and, secondly, it refers to the vertical\ndifferentiation, in age, among youth, maturity and old age\u2014in\nshort, as being \u201ccoevals\u201d. Ortega\u2019s view of three distinct\nlife times, as manifestations of the concept of generation, resides in\nhis notions of \u201ccoevals\u201d (which refers to the interaction\nof individuals of approximately the same age) and of\n\u201ccontemporaries\u201d (which refers to the interaction between\nall individuals of whatever age) and their appositeness with regard to\ntime and to space (Obras, V: 37\u201338). As the active\nengagement in the social world persists in importance for both the\ndevelopment of the individual and society, the inner dynamics of vital\nhuman interaction, for Ortega, are also important insofar as the\nconcept of generation has any significance in illuminating the human\ncondition. Yet we ask ourselves: how do we characterize those\nindividuals who do engage actively in the \u201ccircumstances\u201d\nof their reality but whose social worlds differ from those of other\ngroups of individuals? They may possess the same age as these other\ngroups of individuals and their activities are contemporaneous, but\nthe \u201cvital contact\u201d of one group of individuals who belong\nto a particular social setting does not necessarily interact with that\nof another social group, as their social worlds are different in space\nthough not in time. This question takes us into the broader historical\nimplications of Ortega\u2019s concept of generation.\n\nThe historical nature of human reality and social thought sheds light\non Ortega\u2019s notion that \u201cthere is no spontaneous\ngeneration\u201d, for the \u201cseries of the generations\u201d\nfunction through the continuity of the historical process. Social\nthought and ideas of individuals reflect \u201cthe minds of\nmen\u201d together with the particular generations within which they\ndevelop and, if constituted as \u201ccoming from\u201d and\n\u201cgoing toward\u201d, they become part and parcel of the\n\u201chappening\u201d of the historical process (Obras, VI:\n202\u20134). As we have seen, man\u2019s being-in-the-making, for Ortega,\n\u201cis in man mere happening, happening to him\u201d and,\naccordingly, a happening toward the future: the present evolves out of\nthe past and, as the reality exigent to man, veers toward the future\n(Obras, VI: 37, 40\u201341). This historical sense of continuity\nbetween the minds of men and the succession of generations recalls for\nus Ortega\u2019s assertion that the individual cannot live solely within\nthe isolation of his ego (whether he is a \u201cmass\u201d or a\n\u201cselect\u201d man). Social thought in general, and individuals\u2019\nideas in particular, fail to develop and expand within the solipsistic\nvacuum of the \u201cI\u201d by their very essence. As a being of the\nsocial world, the individual and his ideas are influenced by the\nhistorical context and the very social world within which they\nemerged, and, similarly, formed by the past. From this perspective,\nman, time, thought and society are disclosed in reality as being\nessentially historical. For Ortega, the individual is not born in some\ngeneral place and moment; rather, he or she is born in a particular\nmoment in time and at a particular place in space. Human life has a\nbeginning and an end and, on entering the world, man enters a social\nworld that is given to him in conjunction with the historical process\nof its temporal dimension. As we saw, for Ortega, \u201cman has no\nnature\u2026what he has is history\u201d for, he says, \u201cman\nis the entity that makes itself\u2026the causa sui\u201d.\n(Obras, VI: 33). History, then, provides the process through\nwhich the essence of man becomes manifest both as an individual and a\nsocial being. As an individual being, man undergoes the stream of\nconsciousness of an internal occurrence as a historical process; as a\nbeing-that-lives-in-the-world, man experiences the succession of\ngenerations as an external occurrence within the historical process.\nOrtega posited the \u201ctheme of history\u201d and\n\u201chistorical thought\u201d as proceeding \u201cwith respect to\nthe human phenomena\u201d through the prisms of these internal and\nexternal occurrences. History, through the succession of generations,\nnot only provides us with the basic features of the individual at a\nparticular time and place, but also provides us with \u201ca\nregulative principle\u201d of coherence for human phenomena. The\nunity of the past and the present in history, for Ortega, constitutes\na reality which becomes identified with the experiences of\nindividuals. Like Croce, Ortega perceived history qua history as being\n\u201ccontemporary\u201d and \u201cliving\u201d, whereas mere\nfacts are relegated to the realm of \u201cdead chronicle\u201d.\nThrough the relationship of history to life, he defined history, as\ncontrasted with chronicle, by its vitality and present-mindedness\nrather than by connectedness as such, though he did acknowledge that\nthose who defined it by the latter quality pursued the correct path.\nThe contemporaneity of history, then, proffers a dynamic process that\nis ever changing and continuously absorbed by the past. The relations\nthat past events bear to other events and to the present are\nsignificant in that they are continually changing and, according to\nOrtega, the function of the philosopher becomes not only to describe\nand analyze the past but also to attempt to understand these relations\nin conjunction with human life. The underlying concept of the\nindividual ultimately determines the critical character of historical\ninterpretations, which results from both a reading of the past and\nsimultaneous self-analysis by the observer. In this critical revival\nof the past, the contemporary generation achieves a higher historical\nconsciousness of its own being. Internal consciousness of temporal\nchange within the individual coupled with an awareness of the external\nmanifestations of change in the social world of human reality dispose\none to see how Ortega\u2019s concept of the generation constitutes a\nconcept of historical methodology:\n\nThe concept of the generations, converted into a method of historical\ninvestigation, consists in nothing more than projecting that structure\nacross the past. Anything other than this is to renounce discovering\nthe authentic reality of human life in every period of time\u2014that\nis the mission of history. The method of the generations permits us to\nsee that life from within itself, in its actuality. History is\nvirtually to convert that which has already passed into that which is\npresent. For this reason\u2014and not only\nmetaphorically\u2014history is to relive the past. And as living is\nnothing else but actuality and the present, we have to transmigrate\nfrom the actuality and the present which are ours to those of the\npast, looking at them not from without, not as living experiences\nwhich have been, but as those which persist in being (Obras,\nV: 40).\n\n\nHistorical study, thus, constitutes a humanistic enterprise.\nCurrently, history can be our approach to knowledge of the individual\nand of humanity, and through history we acquire the wealth and wisdom\nof past cultures. The critical awareness of the potentialities of the\nindividual enables us to act in our own historical time with deeper\ninsights and active commitment. History depends on what the\nconsciousness of the historian brings to it, and therefore, the\nhumanistic aspects of historical consciousness stems from the\nrealization that our lives constitute time. For the \u201cpast is\npast\u201d, Ortega remarked,\n\n\nnot because it happened to others but because it forms part of our\npresent, of what we are in the form of having been: in short, because\nit is our past. Life as reality is absolute presence: one\ncannot say that there is anything if it is not present, of\nthis moment. If, then, there is a past, it must be as\nsomething present, something active in us now.\n(Obras, V: 40, 55; 6: 33)\n\n\nIn this connection, Ortega was in accord with Croce\u2019s notion that\n\u201cwe know that history is in all of us and that its sources are\nin our breasts\u201d. According to this notion, the recordings of\n\u201cchronicle\u2019s dead data\u201d of the past fail to register the\nreality of history and human life, which is the \u201cvital\u201d,\nliving action of the present, and one with the past and the future.\nHistory characterizes what we are, instead of something that\nwe possess. Through history we learn who we are by examining\nwhat we have done. In view of this position that we are what\nwe have done, history shapes itself in and through ourselves\n(Obras, VII: 178\u201379).\n\nHence historical time carves the essence of individual configurations.\nFor Ortega, \u201chistorical reason\u201d perceives and registers\nthe tangible facts of historical reality through the demonstrative\nprocess of how the present originated from the past in order to\nengender the future. By the term \u201chistorical reason\u201d,\nOrtega intended to make a clearer distinction between the\n\u201ccultural sciences\u201d and the \u201cnatural sciences\u201d\nto namely posit the notion that history has its\n\u201cautochthonous\u201d reason; history remains in a realm\nentirely its own. Ortega\u2019s notion of history\u2019s\n\u201cautochthonous\u201d reason establishes for history its\nautonomy from both the abstract concepts of philosophy and the logic\nof \u201cphysico-mathematical reason\u201d. His invocation of\nhistory as humanity\u2019s appropriate science, and his overt emphasis on\nthe \u201coriginal, autochthonous\u201d basis of \u201chistorical\nreason\u201d, point to his insistence on the systematic quality of\nhistory and on the \u201ctranscendent\u201d character of physical\nand mathematical reason. History becomes autonomous in that history\nalone consists of the essence of human reality, and historical\nknowledge provides us with the essential understanding of this human\nreality. Every concept \u201cclaiming to represent human\nreality\u201d, he explains, \u201cevery concept referring to human\nlife, specifically, is a function of historical time\u201d\n(Obras, VI: 40\u201341). In conjunction with the\nhistoricization of the individual, historical reason became the medium\nthat circumscribed and eventually supplanted physical and mathematical\nreason as the unitary principle of ultimate reality: human life, and\nthereby \u201chistorical reason\u201d was now viewed as possessing,\nat once, the principle of diversity and unity. Hence, history was\nrationalized and reason was historicized, as with the individual:\n\n\n\u2026Man alienated from himself encounters himself as reality, as\nhistory. And, for the first time, he sees himself compelled to occupy\nhimself with his past, not from curiosity nor in order to find\nnormative examples, but because he has no other thing. Things\nare never done seriously but when, truly, they are absolutely\nnecessary. For this reason, the present hour is the time for history\nto re-establish itself as historical reason.\n\nUntil now history has been contrary to reason. In Greece the two terms\n\u201creason\u201d and \u201chistory\u201d were opposed. And until\nnow, in effect, hardly anyone has been concerned to search in history\nfor its rational substance\u2026. Hence the expression\n\u201chistorical reason\u201d must be understood in all the rigor of\nthe term. Not an extrahistorical reason which appears to fulfill\nitself in history but, literally, a substantive reason constituted\nby what has happened to man, the revelation of reality\ntranscending man\u2019s theories and which is himself, the self underlying\nhis theories (Obras, VI: 49\u201350).\n\n\nIn one of his essays on Hegel, Ortega remarked on the change in\nEuropean intellectual sensitivity that\n\n\nthe \u201cmodern\u201d spirit has experienced in the last\nyears\u2026. The \u201cmodern\u201d [spirit] does not believe as\nnaively in the final age any more. (Obras, II:\n565\u201366)\n\n\nThis modern stance epitomized what Ortega had come to understand as\none of the distinctive characteristics of modernity: the consciousness\nof human life\u2019s increasing depreciation, and the subsequent\nreaffirmation of life through the expression of creative freedom.\nOrtega perceived the early twentieth century as a world emptied of\nmeaning and sought to elude the despair provoked by its\nmeaninglessness. To transform this sense of despair, he affirmed\n\u201cour life, human life\u201d, as the \u201cradical\nreality\u201d. Human life thus constitutes constancy and change or,\nas Ortega proclaimed, \u201chistorical reality\u201d\n(Obras, VII: 99\u2013100; 2: 540\u201341). Through the\ndiscussion of historical reality and historical reason, the ground\nupon which historical knowledge has been based for Ortega becomes\napparent. Speculative philosophies of history, the \u201cowl of\nMinerva\u201d, began its flight at dusk; for Ortega, and for certain\ntwentieth century philosophers of history, \u201chistorical\nreason\u201d proclaims the dawn of human history.\n\nIndividual lives are historical. Where human life has a beginning and\nan end, in view of Ortega\u2019s reading of Hegel, history has neither a\nfirst beginning nor a final end. It can only be conceived of as the\nrealization of the potentialities of the individual in historical\ntime. In retracing the individual\u2019s struggle to control nature and in\nreviving the thoughts and conscious life of the past, historical study\noffers the contemporary generation the challenge of making its own\nvital decisions on the basis of critical knowledge of the full scope\nof former human experiences and achievements. History is understood\nhere in its dual meaning as a factual world of phenomena and as\ndiscipline concerned with only its relevance of life in the\npresent.\n\nStarting from the premise that consciousness, in the sense of\ncognitive awareness, always should be consciousness of something,\nOrtega and modern thinkers have perplexed themselves with questions of\nwhat consciousness is in itself and how it is related to the thing, or\nthe facts, which are its objects. It does not appear to be identical\nwith its objects, yet, neither does perception. Historical\nconsciousness constitutes a concern with the past as being relevant to\nour understanding and apprehending of the human condition. Its key\nattribute consists of our awareness of ourselves as\n\u201cbeing-in-time\u201d. It implies that the temporal ordering of\nevents refers to the very nature of human existence. Historical\nconsciousness thus enables the individual, a civilization and the\nphilosopher of history to expand their experiences beyond their actual\nhistoric time frame to absorb the results of events in which they had\nno part. The study of history thereby opens the horizon to\nparticipation in the completeness of human history.\n\nThis participation in human history has to be understood as being\ndirect and active. Where the physical scientist perceives phenomena\nwhich have a reality independent of the observer, history has the\ncharacter of being real in the consciousness of the historian. The\nword \u201chistory\u201d means both history as actuality\u2014the\nres gestae of Ortega and Collingwood\u2014and written\nhistory; history as what has happened in the past. Clearly, any\nattempt to distinguish between historical reality and historical\naccounts of reality implies the interpreter knowing what constitutes\nhistorical reality. The past is present only insofar as it is relived\nby the historian through sympathy and understanding. The central\nproblems of historical epistemology and methodology revolve around the\nunderstanding that an objective knowledge of the past can be attained\nsolely through the subjective experiences of the investigator. Thus to\nunderstand an action, or past actions, implies comprehending it as an\nexpression or process of meaning conceptually connected to some\nunderlying pattern of thought or intention, rather than as a\ncompletely contingent relation. Moreover, such an underlying pattern\npresupposes a background structure of established rules or practices\nof the sort that may prove to be integral to human life and experience\nas we apprehend them. For to claim, as does Collingwood, that such an\naccount of historical understanding requires the re-enactment of past\nthinking merely directs attention to the method, admittedly familiar\namong historians, of imaginatively projecting oneself into another\u2019s\nposition for the purpose of arriving at an explanatory hypothesis.\nOrtega also claims that,\n\n\nman invents for himself a program of life, a static form of being,\nthat responds satisfactorily to the difficulties planned for him by\ncircumstance. He essays this figure of life, attempts to realize this\nimaginary character he has resolved to be. He embarks on this essay\nillusioned and creates, completely, the experience of it\u2026. But\non experimenting with it, the limits of this vital program make\napparent its insufficiencies. It does not resolve all the\ndifficulties, and it creates new ones (Obras, VI: 41).\n\n\nThe claim was to demonstrate that the explanations historians provide\nare similar in their structural analysis to those put forward in other\nareas of investigation in the social sciences; this demonstrates that\nan explanation of past historical actions, by reference to\nmotivational factors, is possible when presupposing the validity of\npertinent cognitive generalizations. Ortega, together with Croce,\nDilthey, Collingwood and others who associated with the tradition of\nhistoricism, expressed sympathy with those who claimed that the\ninterpretation of human actions raised difficulties for standard\nempiricist accounts and explanations of the human and social world.\nFor the most part, they were wholly committed to universal human\nobjectives and placed a very high value on the uniqueness of the\nindividual. They were concerned with the philosophical implications of\nhistorical knowledge and made attempts to develop systematically the\nproblem of relating presuppositions to the problem of historical\nknowledge. They sought to identify their specialty, philosophy and the\nphilosophy of history, with historical knowledge.\n\u201cHistory\u201d, Ortega averred,\n\n\nis perfect continuity. Every idea of mine comes from another idea of\nmine or from the ideas of some other man\u2026 [Therefore]\nhistorical thinking proceeds with respect to human\nphenomena\u2014philosophy, law, society, arts and letters, language,\nreligion\u2014the same thing began with the natural sciences, as\nestablished in the works of Kepler and Galileo, when they proceeded to\nbring together empirically the simple facts of material phenomena.\n(Obras, VI: 167, 184)\n\n\nOrtega\u2019s contribution to this area of study has been to emphasize what\nhe considered the epistemological implications of historical\nknowledge. In the company of such phenomenologists as Husserl,\nHeidegger and Scheler, Ortega was challenged to continually emphasize\nthe strict and accurate observation of the various elements of human\nexperience. Ortega was persuaded by the argument that isolated\nempirical facts, apart from any understanding of their interior\nmeaning, their inner connection to human life and the meaning of the\nsocial and historical process were limited, if not futile. In adopting\nthese orientations, philosophers, historians and philosophers of\nhistory may learn from philosophical and cultural anthropology that\nconstructive comparisons can be made between understanding what\nindividuals do and understanding what they say. Through this\nconnection the philosopher of history may reconstruct historical time\nas a form of human understanding and, if so inclined, as the process\nthrough which self-analysis may be attempted. As we saw, for Ortega,\nthe interpretation of human actions raises difficulties for standard\nempiricist accounts of explanation of the human and social world. The\nresults of Ortega\u2019s studies in existential phenomenology, historicism\nand the philosophy of history allured him to the approach of choice\nand knowledge of the individual and of humanity. This approach\nadvances the notion that, through history, the epistemological break\noccurs not with the past but with empirical accounts of the past. The\nphilosophical historian\u2019s approach and attitudes toward the past, when\nhoned successfully, can result in his or her ability to comprehend and\ncommunicate with the past on its own terms. The historical approach\nthus serves as a communicative link between the past and the present,\nand the philosopher, in making such communication possible, serves as\na mediator between the worlds of the past and present. The historical\nlines connecting the past and the present also connect temporal\nreality and the observer. To attain this end, Ortega eventually\ngrounded historical knowledge in a thorough knowledge of the\nindividual. \u201cHistory\u201d, he explained,\n\n\nis the systematic science of that radical reality which is my\nlife\u2026. There is no actio in distans. The past is not\nthere, at the date when it happened, but here, in me. The past is\nI\u2014by which I understand, my life. (Obras, VI:\n40\u201341)\n\n\nThe historical act of reconstructing past human creations and\nprojecting oneself into the thoughts of others makes salient critical\nphilosophy of history\u2019s synthetic function of connecting temporal\nreality and mind through the process and consciousness of time.\nThrough this form of communication with the past and present, the\nphenomenological aspect of Ortega\u2019s thought thereby combines with his\nexistential and historicist perspectives. The synthetic function of\nthese perspectives becomes actualized in individual behavior, in\nsocial relations and in history. It is the fusion of these approaches\nthat mark Ortega\u2019s contribution to philosophy. \u201cVery deep is the\nwell in the past\u201d, Thomas Mann wrote at the beginning of his\nnovel, Joseph and His Brothers. In bringing human\nconnectedness and meaning to historical time and mind, Ortega\u2019s\ncritical philosophy of history has provided a synthesis that serves to\nprevent the deep well of the past from becoming bottomless.\n",
