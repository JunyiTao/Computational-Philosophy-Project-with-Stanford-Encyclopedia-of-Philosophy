    "main_text": "The logic of definitions\n2. The logic of definitions\n\nMany definitions\u2014stipulative, descriptive, and\nexplicative\u2014can be analyzed into three elements: the term that\nis defined \\((X)\\), an expression containing the defined term\n\\((\\ldots X\\ldots)\\), and another expression \\((- - - - - - -)\\) that\nis equated by the definition with this expression. Such definitions\ncan be represented thus: \n\\[\\tag{2} X: \\ldots X \\ldots \\eqdf - - - - - - - . \\]\n\n\n(We are setting aside ostensive definitions, which plainly require a\nricher representation.) When the defined term is clear from the\ncontext, the representation may be simplified to \n\\[ \\ldots X \\ldots \\eqdf - - - - - - - . \\]\n\n\nThe expression on the left-hand side of \u2018\\(\\eqdf\\)\u2019 (i.e.,\n\\(\\ldots X\\ldots)\\) is the definiendum of the definition, and\nthe expression on the right-hand side is its\ndefiniens\u2014it being assumed that the definiendum and the\ndefiniens belong to the same logical category. Note the distinction\nbetween defined term and definiendum: the defined term in the present\nexample is \\(X\\); the definiendum is the unspecified expression on the\nleft-hand side of \u2018\\(\\eqdf\\)\u2019, which may or may not be\nidentical to \\(X\\). (Some authors call the defined term \u2018the\ndefiniendum\u2019; some others use the expression confusedly,\nsometimes to refer to the defined term and sometimes to the\ndefiniendum proper.) Not all definitions found in the logical and\nphilosophical literature fit under scheme (2). Partial definitions,\nfor example, fall outside the scheme; another example is provided by\ndefinitions of logical constants in terms of introduction and\nelimination rules governing them. Nonetheless, definitions that\nconform to (2) are the most important, and they will be our primary\nconcern.\n\nLet us focus on stipulative definitions and reflect on their logic.\nSome of the important lessons here carry over, as we shall see, to\ndescriptive and explicative definitions. For simplicity, let us\nconsider the case where a single definition stipulatively introduces a\nterm. (Multiple definitions bring notational complexity but raise no\nnew conceptual issues.) Suppose, then, that a language \\(L\\), the\nground language, is expanded through the addition of a new\nterm \\(X\\) to an expanded language \\(L^{+}\\), where \\(X\\) is\nstipulatively defined by a definition \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) of form (2).\nWhat logical rules govern \\(\\mathcal{D}\\)? What requirements must the\ndefinition fulfill?\n\nBefore we address these questions, let us take note of a distinction\nthat is not marked in logic books but which is useful in thinking\nabout definitions. In one kind of definition\u2014call it\nhomogeneous definition\u2014the defined term and the\ndefiniendum belong to the same logical category. So, a singular term\nis defined via a singular term; a general term via a general term; a\nsentence via a sentence; and so on. Let us say that a homogeneous\ndefinition is regular iff its definiendum is identical to the\ndefined term. Here are some examples of regular homogeneous\ndefinitions: \n\\[\\tag{3} \\begin{align*}\n1: 1 &\\eqdf \\text{the successor of } 0, \\\\\n \\text{man}: \\text{man} &\\eqdf \\text{rational animal}, \\\\\n \\text{The True}: \\text{The True} &\\eqdf \\text{everything is identical to itself}. \n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\nNote that \u2018The True\u2019, as defined above, belongs to the\ncategory of sentence, not that of singular term.\n\nIt is sometimes said that definitions are mere recipes for\nabbreviations. Thus, Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell say\nof definitions\u2014in particular, those used in Principia\nMathematica\u2014that they are \u201cstrictly speaking,\ntypographical conveniences (1925, 11).\u201d This viewpoint has\nplausibility only for regular homogeneous definitions\u2014though it\nis not really tenable even here. (Whitehead and Russell\u2019s own\nobservations make it plain that their definitions are more than mere\n\u201ctypographical\n conveniences.\u201d[3])\n The idea that definitions are mere abbreviations is not at all\nplausible for the second kind of definition, to which we now turn.\n\nIn the second kind of definition\u2014call it a\nheterogeneous definition\u2014the defined term and the\ndefiniendum belong to different logical categories. So, for example, a\ngeneral term (e.g., \u2018man\u2019) may be defined using a\nsentential definiendum (e.g., \u2018\\(x\\) is a man\u2019). For\nanother example, a singular term (e.g., \u20181\u2019) may be\ndefined using a predicate (e.g., \u2018is identical to 1\u2019).\nHeterogeneous definitions are far more common than homogeneous ones.\nIn familiar first-order languages, for instance, it is pointless to\ndefine, say, a one-place predicate \\(G\\) by a homogeneous definition.\nThese languages have no resources for forming compound predicates;\nhence, the definiens of a homogeneous definition of \\(G\\) is bound to\nbe atomic. In a heterogeneous definition, however, the definiens can\neasily be complex; for example, \n\\[\\tag{4} Gx \\eqdf x \\gt 3 \\amp x \\lt 10. \\]\n\n\nIf the language has a device for nominalization of\npredicates\u2014e.g., a class abstraction operator\u2014we could\ngive a different sort of heterogeneous definition for G:\n\n\\[\\tag{5} \\text{the class of } G \\text{s} \\eqdf \\text{the class of numbers between 3 and 10.}\\]\n\n\nObserve that a heterogeneous definition such as (4) is not a mere\nabbreviation. For one thing, we regard the expression \\(x\\) in it as a\ngenuine variable which admits of substitution and binding. So, the\ndefiniendum Gx is not a mere abbreviation\nfor the definiens. Moreover, if such definitions were abbreviations,\nthey would be subject to the requirement that the definiendum must be\nshorter than the definiens, but no such requirement exists.\nOn the other hand, genuine requirements on definitions would make\nlittle sense. The following stipulation is not a legitimate\ndefinition: \n\\[\\tag{6} Gx \\eqdf x \\gt y \\amp x \\lt 10. \\]\n\n\nBut if it is viewed as a mere abbreviation, there is nothing\nillegitimate about it. (Indeed, mathematicians routinely make use of\nabbreviations of this kind, suppressing variables that are temporarily\nuninteresting.)\n\nSome stipulative definitions are nothing but mere devices of\nabbreviation (e.g., the definitions governing the omission of\nparentheses in formulas; see Church 1956, \u00a711). However, many\nstipulative definitions are not of this kind; they introduce\nmeaningful items into our discourse. Thus, definition (4) renders\n\\(G\\) a meaningful unary predicate: \\(G\\) expresses, in virtue of (4),\na particular concept. In contrast, under stipulation (6), \\(G\\) is not\na meaningful predicate and expresses no concept of any kind. But what\nis the source of the difference? Why is (4) legitimate, but not (6)?\nMore generally, when is a definition legitimate? What requirements\nmust the definiens fulfill? And, for that matter, the definiendum?\nMust the definiendum be, for instance, atomic, as in (3) and (4)? If\nnot, what restrictions (if any) are there on the definiendum?\n",
