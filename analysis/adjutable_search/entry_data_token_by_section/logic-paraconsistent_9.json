    "main_text": "Motivations || Vagueness\n2.5 Vagueness\n\nFrom the start, paraconsistent logics were intended in part to deal\nwith problems of vagueness and the\n sorites paradox\n (Ja\u015bkowski 1948 [1969]). Some empirical evidence suggest that\nvagueness in natural language is a good candidate for paraconsistent\ntreatment (Ripley 2011).\n\nA few different paraconsistent approaches to vagueness have been\nsuggested. Subvaluationism is the logical dual to\nsupervaluationism: if a claim is true on some acceptable\nsharpening of a vague predicate, then it is true. Where the\nsupervaluationist sees indeterminacy, or truth-value gaps, the\nsubvaluationist sees overdeterminacy, truth-value gluts. A\nsubvaluation logic will, like its supervaluational dual, preserve all\nclassical tautologies, as long as the definition of validity is\nrestricted to the non-glutty cases. Because it is so structurally\nsimilar to supervaluationism, subvaluationism is also subject to most\nof the same criticisms (Hyde 1997).\n\nMore broadly, (dialetheic) paraconsistency has been used in\nstraightforward three-valued truth-functional approaches to vagueness.\nThe aim is to preserve both of the following intuitive claims:\n\nTolerance: For vague \\(F\\), it is not the case that\n\\(x\\) is \\(F\\) but some very \\(F\\)-similar \\(x\\) is not \\(F\\) \nCutoffs: For all \\(F\\), if some \\(x\\) is \\(F\\) and some\n\\(y\\) is not, and there is an ordered \\(F\\)-progression from \\(x\\) to\n\\(y\\), then there is some last \\(F\\) and some first non-\\(F\\) \n\n\nAgain, the key to the analysis is to take cutoffs as sites for\ninconsistency, for objects both F and not F. Then all tolerance claims\n(about vague F) are taken as true; but since, paraconsistently, the\ninference of disjunctive syllogism is not generally valid, these\nclaims do not imply absurdities like \u2018everyone is bald\u2019.\nParaconsistent models place a great deal of emphasis on cutoff points\nof vague predicates, attributing much of the trouble with the sorties\nparadox to underlying inconsistency of vague predicates (Weber 2010a).\n\nThere is debate as to whether the sorties paradox is of a kind with\nthe other well-known semantic and set theoretic paradoxes, like\nRussell\u2019s and the liar. If it is, then a paraconsistent approach\nto one would be as natural as to the other.\n",
