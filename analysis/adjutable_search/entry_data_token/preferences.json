The Basic Concept of Preference\n\nIn common parlance, the term \u201cpreference\u201d assumes\ndifferent meanings, including that of comparative evaluation,\nprioritisation or favouring, and choice ranking (See for instance\nthe Oxford English Dictionary). In this entry, we discuss the\nnotion of preference as subjective comparative evaluations,\nof the form \u201cAgent \\(A\\) prefers \\(X\\) to \\(Y\\)\u201d. This\ncharacterisation distinguishes preference from other evaluative\nconcepts. \n\nPreferences are evaluations: they concern matters of value,\ntypically in relation to practical reasoning, i.e. questions about\nwhat should be done, or should have been done. This distinguishes\npreferences from concepts that concern matters of fact. \n\nFurthermore, preferences are subjective in that the\nevaluation is typically attributed to an agent \u2013 where this\nagent might be either an individual or a collective. This\ndistinguishes them from statements to the effect that \u201c\\(X\\) is\nbetter than \\(Y\\)\u201d in an objective or otherwise impersonal\nsense. The logic of preference has often also been used to represent\nsuch objective evaluations (e.g. Broome 1991b), but the substantial\nnotion of preference includes this subjective element. \n\nFinally, preferences are comparative in that they express the\nevaluation of an item \\(X\\)  relative to another item\n\\(Y\\). This distinguishes them from monadic concepts like\n\u201cgood\u201d, \u201cis desired\u201d, etc. which only evaluate\none item. \n\nMost philosophers take the evaluated items to be propositions. In\ncontrast to this, economists commonly conceive of items as bundles of\n goods, represented as \n vectors.[1] \nHowever, this approach has a difficult ambiguity. If\npreferences are subjective evaluations of the alternatives, then what\nmatters are the results that can be obtained with the help of these\ngoods, not the goods themselves. Whether an agent has a preference\ne.g. for a batch of wood over a crate of bricks will depend on whether\nshe intends to use it to generate warmth, build a shelter or create a\nsculpture. Economists have tried to solve this ambiguity by coupling\npreferences over goods with household production functions (Lancaster\n1966, Becker and Michael 1973); but as these functions are very\ndifficult to determine, it is often thought more parsimonious to stick\nwith the sentential or propositional representations of states of the\nworld. \n\nSerious engagement with preferences began in the 20th\ncentury. In the social sciences, the preference concept became\nimportant for explanatory and predictive purposes with Irving\nFisher\u2019s (1892) and Vilfredo Pareto\u2019s (1909)\nmethodological criticisms of hedonistic cardinal utility. Previously,\neconomists largely agreed that decisions were motivated by the\nindividual\u2019s quest for pleasure, and that the difference in\nquantity of pleasure derived from different alternatives was an\nimportant influence on decisions. In that framework, the notion of\npreference, to the extent that it was used at all, was merely derived\nfrom hedonistic utility: \\(X\\) is preferred to \\(Y\\) iff\n\\(X\\) yields more utility than \\(Y\\). Pareto argued that\nbecause an accurate measurement procedure for cardinal hedonic utility\nwas not available, social scientists should constrain themselves to\nmerely ordinal comparisons (Bruni and Guala 2001). This argument\nturned preference into a fundamental notion of the social sciences,\nreplacing (hedonic) utility. \n\nEconomists in the 1930s (Hicks and Allen 1934) radicalised\nPareto\u2019s idea and argued that cardinal utility should be\nexcluded in order to expunge economics from psychological hedonism.\nHowever, their concept of preference retained psychological content:\npeople are assumed to act purposefully and therefore to have\npreferences that really constitute mental evaluations, rather than\nbeing ex-post rationalisations of behaviour (Lewin 1996). Furthermore,\nRamsey (1926) and later von Neumann and Morgenstern (1944) devised\nformal tools allowing the representation of preference magnitudes as\nutility functions on an interval scale. This new utility, however, was very different from\nthe older hedonic concept: the preference concept was basic. The cardinal utility function was constructed to reflect the preference ordering, but was not completely determined by it. \n\nPsychologists also sought to move away from the old psychophysical\nassumptions and began seeing mental concepts like preferences with\nincreased suspicion. Instead, they sought not only to connect and\nmeasure psychological events, but indeed replace them by the\nbehavioural criteria with which they were hitherto connected. (See the\nentry on\n behaviorism).\n Again, it was an economist, Paul Samuelson, who formulated this\nprinciple most explicitly for the concept of preference. In 1938 he\nsuggested to \u201cstart anew \u2026 dropping off the last vestiges\nof the utility analysis\u201d (1938, pp. 61\u201362). Preferences\nwere supposed to be defined in terms of choice, thus eliminating\nreference to mental states altogether. Although this approach was highly influential at\nthe time, economists have largely not followed Samuelson in this\nradical proposal (Hausman 2012), and it might indeed be the case that\nSamuelson himself later changed his mind (Hands 2014). With the\nincreasing convergence of (parts of) economics and psychology, the\nordinal psychological interpretation of preferences appears to\ncurrently dominate in these disciplines. However, there is an ongoing\ndiscussion amongst philosophers whether the current concept of\npreference used by economists is this mental,\n\u201cfolk-theoretic\u201d notion or a separate theoretical concept\n(M\u00e4ki 2000, Ross 2014, Thoma 2021). \n\nIn philosophy, the concept of preference gained increased attention in\nthe wake of the conceptual developments in the social sciences.\nBecause the hedonic utility notion was increasingly questioned,\nutilitarian philosophers sought alternative foundations for their\nethical theories. Today, preferentialism defends satisfaction\nof individual preferences as the only intrinsic value bearer, and thus\nis a subcategory of the broad welfarist family of value theories,\nwhich identify intrinsic value with well-being. Few people defend the\nview that well-being is constituted by the satisfaction of\nany preference, but a number of authors defend refined\nversions of preferentialism (e.g. Rawls 1971, Scanlon 1998).\nPhilosophers have also discussed the formal properties of preferences\nin preference logic. To this we turn in the next section.\n\n2. Preference logic\n\nAlthough not all philosophical references to preference make use of\nformal tools, preferences are almost always assumed to have structural\nproperties of a type that is best described in a formalized language.\nThe study of the structural properties of preferences can be traced\nback to Book III of Aristotle\u2019s Topics. Since the early\ntwentieth century several philosophers have studied the structure of\npreferences with logical tools. In 1957 and in 1963, respectively,\nS\u00f6ren Halld\u00e9n and Georg Henrik von Wright proposed the\nfirst complete systems of preference logic (Halld\u00e9n 1957, von\nWright 1963). The subject also has important roots in utility theory\nand in the theory of games and decisions. The preferences studied in\npreference logic are usually the preferences of rational individuals,\nbut preference logic is also used in psychology and behavioural\neconomics, where the emphasis is on actual preferences as revealed in\nbehaviour.\n2.1 Concepts and notation\n\nThere are two fundamental comparative value concepts, namely\n\u201cbetter\u201d (strict preference) and \u201cequal in value\nto\u201d (indifference) (Halld\u00e9n 1957, 10). These terms are\nused to express the wishes of persons, but they are also used for\nother purposes, for instance to express objective or intersubjectively\nvalid betterness that does not coincide with the pattern of wishes of\nany individual person. However, the structural (logical) properties of\nbetterness and value equality do not seem to differ between the cases\nwhen they correspond to what we usually call \u201cpreferences\u201d\nand the cases when they do not. The term \u201cpreference\nlogic\u201d is standardly used to cover the logic of these concepts\neven in cases when we would typically not use the term\n\u201cpreference\u201d in a non-formalized context.\n\nThe relations of preference and indifference between alternatives are\nusually denoted by the symbols \\(\\succ\\) and \\(\\sim\\) or alternatively by\n\\(P\\) and \\(I\\). In accordance with a long-standing\nphilosophical tradition, \\(A\\succ B\\) is taken to\nrepresent \u201c\\(B\\) is worse than \\(A\\)\u201d, as well\nas \u201c\\(A\\) is better than \\(B\\)\u201d. The objects\nof preference are represented by the relata of the preference relation\n\\((A\\) and \\(B\\) in \\(A\\succ B)\\). In order\nto make the formal structure determinate enough, every preference\nrelation is assumed to range over a specified set of relata. In most\napplications, the relata are assumed to be mutually exclusive, i.e.\nnone of them is compatible with, or included in, any of the others.\nPreferences over a set of mutually exclusive relata are referred to as\nexclusionary preferences. When the relata are mutually\nexclusive, it is customary to call the set of relata\nan alternative set, or set of alternatives, \\(\\mathcal{A}\\).\n\n\nThe following four properties of the two exclusionary comparative\nrelations are usually taken to be part of the meaning of the concepts\nof (strict) preference and indifference:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\tag{1}\nA\\succ B \\rightarrow \\neg(B\\succ A) &\\quad\\text{(asymmetry of preference)}\\\\\n\n\\tag{2}\nA\\sim B \\rightarrow B\\sim A &\\quad\\text{(symmetry of indifference)}\\\\\n\n\\tag{3}\nA\\sim A &\\quad\\text{(reflexivity of indifference)}\\\\\n\n\\tag{4}\nA\\succ B \\rightarrow \\neg(A\\sim B) &\\quad\\text{(incompatibility of preference} \\\\\n&\\quad\\text{ and indifference)}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nIt follows from (1) that strict preference is irreflexive, i.e. that\n\\(\\neg(A\\succ A)\\).\n\nThe relation \\(\\succcurlyeq\\), \u201cat least as good as\u201d (or more\nprecisely: \u201cbetter than or equal in value to\u201d), can be\ndefined as follows:\n\n\\[\nA\\succcurlyeq B \\leftrightarrow A\\succ B \\vee A\\sim B \\quad\\text{(weak preference)}\n\\]\n\n\nThe alternative notation \\(R\\) is sometimes used instead of\n\\(\\succcurlyeq\\).\n\nFor reasons of convenience, weak preference is usually taken to be the\nprimitive relation of preference logic. Then both (strict) preference\nand indifference are introduced as derived relations, as follows:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\nA\\succ B &\\text{ if and only if } A\\succcurlyeq B \\text{ and } \\neg(B\\succcurlyeq A) \\\\\n\nA\\sim B &\\text{ if and only if } A\\succcurlyeq B \\text{ and } B\\succcurlyeq A\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n\\(\\succ\\) is the strict part of \\(\\succcurlyeq\\) and \\(\\sim\\) its\nsymmetric part.\n\nTwo common notational conventions should be mentioned. First, chains\nof relations can be contracted. Hence, \\(A\\succcurlyeq B\\succcurlyeq\nC\\) abbreviates \\(A\\succcurlyeq B \\wedge B\\succcurlyeq C\\), and\n\\(A\\succ B\\succ C\\sim D\\) abbreviates \\(A\\succ B \\wedge B\\succ C\n\\wedge C\\sim D\\). Second, the ancestral symbol * is used to contract\nrepeated uses of the same relation; hence \\(\\succ\\)* stands for\n\\(\\succ\\) repeated any finite non-zero number of times (and similarly\nfor the other relations). Thus \\(A\\succ *C\\) denotes that either\n\\(A\\succ C\\) or there are \\(B_1 \\ldots B_n\\) such that\n\n\\[\nA\\succ B_1 \\wedge B_1 \\succ B_2 \\wedge \\ldots B_{n-1}\\succ B_n \\wedge B_n\\succ C.\n\\]\n\n2.2 Completeness\n\nIn most applications of preference logic, it is taken for granted that\nthe following property, called completeness or\nconnectedness, should be satisfied:\n\n\\[\nA\\succcurlyeq B \\vee B\\succcurlyeq A\n\\]\n\n\nor equivalently:\n\n\\[\nA\\succ B \\vee A\\sim B \\vee B\\succ A\n\\]\n\n\nThe following weaker version of the property is sometimes useful: \n\n\\[\n\\text{If } A\\ne B, \\text{ then } \n A\\succcurlyeq B \\vee B\\succcurlyeq A \\quad\\text{(weak connectivity)}\n\\]\n\n(Completeness holds if and only if both weak\nconnectivity and reflexivity of indifference hold.)\n\n\nCompleteness (connectedness) is commonly assumed in many applications,\nnot least in economics. Bayesian decision theory is a case in point.\nThe Bayesian decision maker is assumed to make her choices in\naccordance with a complete preference ordering over the available\noptions. However, in many everyday cases, we do not have, and do not\nneed, complete preferences. Consider a person who has to choose\nbetween five available objects \\(A, B, C, D\\), and \\(E\\). If she knows\nthat she prefers \\(A\\) to the others, then she does not have to make\nup her mind about the relative ranking among \\(B, C, D\\), and\n\\(E\\).\n\nIn terms of resolvability, there are three major types of preference\nincompleteness. First, incompleteness may be uniquely\nresolvable, i.e. resolvable in exactly one way. The most natural\nreason for this type of incompleteness is lack of knowledge or\nreflection. Behind what we perceive as an incomplete preference\nrelation there may be a complete preference relation that we can\narrive at through observation, introspection, logical inference, or\nsome other means of discovery. \n\nSecondly, incompleteness may be multiply resolvable, i.e.\npossible to resolve in several different ways. In this case it is\ngenuinely undetermined what will be the outcome of extending the\nrelation to cover the previously uncovered cases.\n\nThirdly, incompleteness may be irresolvable. The most natural\nreason for this is that the alternatives differ in terms of advantages\nor disadvantages that we are unable to put on the same footing. A\nperson may be unable to say which she prefers\u2014the death of two\nspecified acquaintances or the death of a specified friend. She may\nalso be unable to say whether she prefers the destruction of the\npyramids in Giza or the extinction of the giant panda. In\nenvironmental economics, as a third example, it is a controversial\nissue whether and to what extent environmental damage is comparable to\nmonetary loss.\n\nTwo alternatives are called \u201cincommensurable\u201d whenever it\nis impossible to measure them with the same unit of measurement. Cases\nof irresolvable incompleteness are often also cases of\nincommensurability (Chang 1997). In moral philosophy, irresolvable\nincompleteness is usually discussed in terms of the related notion of\na moral dilemma.\n2.3 Transitivity\n\nBy far the most discussed logical property of preferences is the\nfollowing:\n\n\\[\nA\\succcurlyeq B \\wedge B\\succcurlyeq C \\rightarrow A\\succcurlyeq C\n\\quad\\text{(transitivity of weak preference)}\n\\]\n\n\nThe corresponding properties of the other two relations are defined\nanalogously:\n\n\\[\nA\\sim B \\wedge B\\sim C \\rightarrow A\\sim C\n\\quad\\text{(transitivity of indifference)}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nA\\succ B \\wedge B\\succ C \\rightarrow A\\succ C\n\\quad\\text{(transitivity of strict preference)}\n\\]\n\n\nA weak preference relation \\(\\succcurlyeq\\) is\ncalled quasi-transitive if its strict part \\(\\succ\\) is\ntransitive.\n\nMany other properties have been defined that are related to\ntransitivity. The following three are among the most important of\nthese:\n\n\n\\(A\\sim B \\wedge B\\succ C \\rightarrow A\\succ C\n\\quad\\text{(IP-transitivity)}\\)\n\n\\(A\\succ B \\wedge B\\sim C \\rightarrow A\\succ C\n\\quad\\text{(PI-transitivity)}\\)\n\nThere is no series \\(A_1 ,\\ldots ,A_n\\) of alternatives such that\n\\(A_1 \\succ \\ldots \\succ A_n\\succ A_1\\) \n\\(\\text{(acyclicity)}\\)\n\n\nAll of these are ways of weakening the transitivity of \\(\\succcurlyeq\\). Thus, if \\(\\succcurlyeq\\) satisfies transitivity then \\(\\succ\\) and \\(\\sim\\)\nare also transitive, and furthermore, IP-transitivity, PI-transitivity\nand acyclicity hold.\n\nFurthermore, if \\(\\succcurlyeq\\) is transitive, then no cycles\ncontaining \\(\\succ\\) are possible, i.e. there are no \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)\nsuch that \\(A\\succcurlyeq *B\\succ A\\). Preferences with such a\n\\(\\succ\\)-containing cycle are called cyclic preferences.\n\nTransitivity is a controversial property, and many examples have been\noffered to show that it does not hold in general. A classic type of\ncounterexample to transitivity is the so-called Sorites Paradox. It\nemploys a series of objects that are so arranged that we cannot\ndistinguish between two adjacent members of the series, whereas we can\ndistinguish between members at greater distance (Armstrong 1939,\nArmstrong 1948, Luce 1956). Consider 1000 cups of coffee, numbered\n\\(C_0, C_1, C_2,\\ldots\\) up to \\(C_{999}\\). Cup \\(C_0\\) contains no\nsugar, cup \\(C_1\\) one grain of sugar, cup \\(C_2\\) two grains\netc. Since one cannot taste the difference between \\(C_{999}\\) and\n\\(C_{998}\\), one might consider them to be equally good (of equal\nvalue), \\(C_{999}\\sim C_{998}\\). For the same reason, we have\n\\(C_{998}\\sim C_{997}\\), etc. all the way to \\(C_1\\sim C_0\\), but\nclearly \\(C_0 \\succ C_{999}\\). This contradicts transitivity of\nindifference, and therefore also transitivity of weak preference.\n\nIn a related example proposed by Warren S. Quinn, a device has been\nimplanted into the body of a person (the self-torturer). The device\nhas 1001 settings, from 0 (off) to 1000. Each increase leads to a\nnegligible increase in pain. Each week, the self-torturer \u201chas\nonly two options\u2014to stay put or to advance the dial one setting.\nBut he may advance only one step each week, and he may never\nretreat. At each advance he gets $10,000.\u201d In this way\nhe may \u201ceventually reach settings that will be so painful that\nhe would then gladly relinquish his fortune and return to 0\u201d\n(Quinn 1990, 79).\n\nIn an important type of counterexamples to transitivity of strict\npreference, different properties of the alternatives dominate in\ndifferent pairwise comparisons. Consider an agent choosing between\nthree boxes of Christmas ornaments (Schumm 1987). Each box contains\nthree balls, coloured green, red and blue, respectively; they are\nrepresented by the vectors \\(\\langle R_1,G_1,B_1\\rangle,\\) \\(\\langle\nR_2,G_2,B_2\\rangle\\), and \\(\\langle R_3,G_3,B_3\\rangle\\).  The agent\nstrictly prefers box 1 to box 2, since they contain (to her) equally\nattractive blue and green balls, but the red ball of box 1 is more\nattractive than that of box 2. She prefers box 2 to box 3, since they\nare equal but for the green ball of box 2, which is more attractive\nthan that of box 3. And finally, she prefers box 3 to box 1, since\nthey are equal but for the blue ball of box 3, which is more\nattractive than that of box 1. Thus,\n\n\\[R_1\\succ R_2\\sim R_3\\sim R_1,\\]\n\n\\[G_1\\sim G_2\\succ G_3\\sim G_1,\\]\n\n\\[B_1\\sim B_2\\sim B_3\\succ B_1;\\]\n\n\nand from this follows\n\n\\[\n\\langle R_1,G_1,B_1\\rangle \\succ \\langle R_2,G_2,B_2\\rangle \\succ \\langle R_3,G_3,B_3\\rangle \\succ \\langle R_1,G_1,B_1\\rangle.\n\\]\n\n\nThe described situation yields a preference cycle, which contradicts\ntransitivity of strict preference. (Notice the structural similarity\nto Condorcet\u2019s Paradox, see the entry on\n voting methods.)\n\nThese and similar examples can be used to show that actual human\nbeings may have cyclic preferences. It does not necessarily follow,\nhowever, that the same applies to the idealized rational\nagents of preference logic. Perhaps such patterns are due to\nirrationality or to factors, such as lack of knowledge or\ndiscrimination, that prevent actual humans from being rational. There\nis a strong tradition, not least in economic applications, to regard\nfull \\(\\succcurlyeq\\)-transitivity as a necessary prerequisite of\nrationality.\n\nThe most famous argument in favour of preference transitivity is the\nmoney pump argument. The basic idea was developed by F.P. Ramsey\n(1928a, 182), who pointed out that if a subject\u2019s behaviour\nviolated certain axioms of probability and preference, then \nhe would be willing to buy a bet that yields a gain to the seller, and a loss to the buyer, no matter what happens. The argument was developed in more detail\nin Davidson et al. (1955). \n\nThe following example can be used to show how the argument works in a\nnon-probabilistic context: A certain stamp-collector has cyclic\npreferences with respect to three stamps, denoted \\(A, B\\), and\n\\(C\\). She prefers \\(A\\) to \\(B, B\\) to \\(C\\), and \\(C\\) to \\(A\\).\nFollowing Ramsey, we may assume that there is an amount of money, say\n10 cents, that she is prepared to pay for exchanging \\(B\\) for \\(A,\nC\\) for \\(B\\), or \\(A\\) for \\(C\\).  She comes into a stamp shop with\nstamp \\(A\\). The stamp-dealer offers her to trade in \\(A\\) for \\(C\\),\nif she pays 10 cents. She accepts the deal.\n\nFor a precise notation, let \\(\\langle X,V\\rangle\\) denote\nthat the collector owns stamp \\(X\\) and has paid \\(V\\) cents\nto the dealer. She has now moved from the state\n\\(\\langle A,0\\rangle\\) to the state \\(\\langle C,10\\rangle\\).\n\nNext, the stamp-dealer takes out stamp \\(B\\) from a drawer, and\noffers her to swap \\(C\\) for \\(B\\), against another payment\nof 10 cents. She accepts, thus moving from the state\n\\(\\langle C,10\\rangle\\) to \\(\\langle B,20\\rangle\\). The shop-owner\ncan go on like this forever. What causes the trouble is the following\nsequence of preferences:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\langle C,10\\rangle &\\succ \\langle A,0\\rangle  \\\\\n\\langle B,20\\rangle &\\succ \\langle C,10\\rangle \\\\\n\\langle A,30\\rangle &\\succ \\langle B,20\\rangle \\\\\n\\langle C,40\\rangle &\\succ \\langle A,30\\rangle \\\\\n\\langle B,50\\rangle &\\succ \\langle C,40\\rangle \\\\\n\\langle A,60\\rangle &\\succ \\langle B,50\\rangle \\\\\n&\\vdots\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThe money-pump argument relies on a particular, far from\nuncontroversial, way to combine preferences in two dimensions, which\nis only possible if two crucial assumptions are satisfied: (1) The\nprimary alternatives (the stamps) can be combined with some other\ncommodity (money) to form composite alternatives. (2) Irrespectively\nof the previous transactions there is always, for each preferred\nchange of primary alternatives, some non-zero loss of the auxiliary\ncommodity (money) that is worth that change. The money-pump can be\nused to extract money from a subject with cyclic preferences only if\nthese two conditions are satisfied.\n\nAnother argument for the normative appropriateness of preference\ntransitivity suggests that transitivity is constitutive of the meaning\nof preference, in addition to the minimal properties mentioned in\nsection 2.1. Drawing an analogy to length measurement, Davidson (1976,\n273) asks: \u201cIf length is not transitive, what does it mean to\nuse a number to measure length at all? We could find or invent an\nanswer, but unless or until we do, we must strive to interpret\n\u2018longer than\u2019 so that it comes out transitive. Similarly\nfor \u2018preferred to\u2019\u201d. Violating transitivity,\nDavidson claims, thus undermines the very meaning of preferring an\noption over others. \n\nYet another argument rests on the importance of preferences for\nchoice. When agents choose from an \nalternative set, then preferences should be choice guiding.\nThey should have such a structure that they can be used to guide our\nchoice among the elements of that set. But when choosing e.g. from\n\\(\\{A,B,C\\}\\), a preference relation \\(\\succ\\) such that\n\\(A\\succ B\\succ C\\succ A\\) does not\nguide choice at all: any or none of the alternatives should be chosen\naccording to \\(\\succ\\). The transitivity of preference, it is therefore\nsuggested, is a necessary condition for a meaningful connection\nbetween preferences and choice. A critic, however, can point out that\npreferences are important even when they cannot guide choices. Take\ne.g. preferences over lottery outcomes: these are real preferences,\nregardless of the fact that one cannot choose between lottery\noutcomes. Further, the necessary criteria for choice guidance are much\nweaker than weak transitivity (Hansson 2001, 23\u201325; compare also\nversions of decision theory in which transitivity fails, e.g. Fishburn\n1991). Last, the indifference relation does not satisfy choice\nguidance either. That does not make it irrational to be indifferent\nbetween alternatives. Thus, choice guidance can be an argument for the\nnormative appropriateness of transitivity only under certain\nrestrictions, if at all (For further discussion, see Anand 1993). \n2.4 Order typology\n\nOne more property of preference relations needs to be specified. A\nrelation is antisymmetric if\n\n\\[\nA\\succcurlyeq B \\wedge B\\succcurlyeq A \\rightarrow A=B\n\\text{ (antisymmetry of preference)}\n\\]\n\n\nThe categories summarized in the table below (based on Sen 1970a) are\nstandardly used to denominate preference relations that satisfy\ncertain logical properties.\n\n\n\nProperties\nName(s) \n\n1.\nreflexive, transitive\nPreorder, Quasi-order \n\n2.\nreflexive, transitive,\nanti-symmetric\nPartial order \n\n3.\nirreflexive, transitive\nStrict partial order \n\n4.\nreflexive, transitive, complete\nTotal preorder, Complete quasi-ordering, Weak ordering \n\n5.\nreflexive, transitive, complete,\nanti-symmetric\nChain, Linear ordering, Complete\nordering \n\n6.\nasymmetric, transitive, weakly\nconnected\nStrict total order, Strong ordering \n\n2.5 Combinative preferences\n\nSections 2.1\u20132.4 were devoted to exclusionary preferences, i.e.\npreferences that refer to a set of mutually exclusive alternatives. In\npractice, people also have preferences between relata that are not\nmutually exclusive. These are called combinative preferences.\n\n\nRelata of combinative preferences are not specified enough\nto be mutually exclusive. To say that one prefers having a dog over\nhaving a cat neglects the possibility that one may have both at\nthe same time. Depending on how one interprets it, this preference\nexpression may say very different things. It may mean that one prefers\na dog (and no cat) to a cat (and no dog). Or, if one already has a\ncat, it may mean that one prefers a dog and a cat to just having a\ncat. Or, if one already has a dog, it may mean that one prefers just a\ndog to both a cat and a dog. Combinative preferences are usually taken\nto have states of affairs as their relata. These are represented by\nsentences in sentential logic. It is usually assumed that logically\nequivalent expressions can be substituted for each other.\n\nProperties such as completeness, transitivity and acyclicity can be\ntransferred from exclusionary to combinative preferences. In addition,\nthere are interesting logical properties that can be expressed with\ncombinative preferences but not with exclusionary preferences. The\nfollowing are some examples of these (some of which are\ncontroversial):\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\np\\succcurlyeq q \\rightarrow p\\succcurlyeq(p\\vee q)\\succcurlyeq q \n  &\\quad\\text{(disjunctive interpolation)} \\\\\n\np\\succcurlyeq q \\rightarrow \\neg q\\succcurlyeq \\neg p\n  &\\quad\\text{(contraposition of weak preference)} \\\\\n\np\\sim q \\rightarrow \\neg q\\sim \\neg p\n  &\\quad\\text{(contraposition of indifference)} \\\\\n\np\\succ q \\rightarrow \\neg q\\succ \\neg p\n  &\\quad\\text{(contraposition of strict preference)} \\\\\n\np\\succcurlyeq q \\leftrightarrow (p\\wedge \\neg q)\\succcurlyeq(q\\wedge \\neg p)\n  &\\quad\\text{(conjunctive expansion of}  \\\\\n  &\\quad\\text{ weak preference)} \\\\\n\np\\succ q \\leftrightarrow (p\\wedge \\neg q)\\succ(q\\wedge \\neg p)\n  &\\quad\\text{(conjunctive expansion of} \\\\\n  &\\quad\\text{  strict preference)} \\\\\n\np\\sim q \\leftrightarrow (p\\wedge \\neg q)\\sim(q\\wedge \\neg p)\n  &\\quad\\text{(conjunctive expansion of indifference)} \\\\\n\n(p\\vee q)\\succcurlyeq r \\leftrightarrow p\\succcurlyeq r \\wedge q\\succcurlyeq r\n  &\\quad\\text{(left disjunctive distribution of } \\succcurlyeq) \\\\\n\np\\succcurlyeq(q\\vee r) \\leftrightarrow p\\succcurlyeq q \\wedge p\\succcurlyeq r\n  &\\quad\\text{(right disjunctive distribution of } \\succcurlyeq)\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nCombinative preferences can be derived from exclusionary preferences,\nwhich are then taken to be more basic. In most variants of this\napproach, the underlying alternatives (to which the exclusionary\npreferences refer) are possible worlds, represented by maximal\nconsistent subsets of the language (Rescher 1967, von Wright 1972). \nHowever, it has been argued that a more realistic\napproach should be based on smaller alternatives that cover all the\naspects under consideration \u2013 but not all the aspects that might\nhave been considered. This approach may be seen as an application of\nSimon\u2019s \u201cbounded rationality view\u201d (Simon 1957,\n196\u2013200).\n\nThe derivation of combinative preferences from exclusionary\npreferences can be obtained with a representation function. By this is\nmeant a function \\(f\\) that takes us from a pair\n\\(\\langle p,q\\rangle\\) of sentences to a set\n\\(f(\\langle p,q\\rangle)\\) of pairs of alternatives\n(perhaps possible worlds). Then\n\\(p\\succcurlyeq\\)\\(_f\\)q holds if and only if\n\\(A\\succcurlyeq B\\) for all \\(\\langle A,B\\rangle \\in f(\\langle p,q\\rangle)\\) (Hansson 2001,\n70\u201373).\n2.6 Preference-based monadic value predicates\n\nIn addition to the comparative notions, \u201cbetter\u201d and\n\u201cof equal value\u201d, informal discourse on values contains\nmonadic (one-place) value predicates, such as \u201cgood\u201d,\n\u201cbest\u201d, \u201cvery bad\u201d, \u201cfairly good\u201d,\netc. Predicates representing these notions can be inserted into a\nformal structure that contains a preference relation.\n\nTwo major attempts have been made to define the principal monadic\npredicates \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d in terms of the\npreference relation. One of these defines \u201cgood\u201d as\n\u201cbetter than its negation\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d as\n\u201cworse than its negation\u201d (Brogan 1919).\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\nG_N p \\leftrightarrow p\\succ \\neg p &\\quad\\text{(negation-related good)} \\\\\nB_N p \\leftrightarrow \\neg p\\succ p &\\quad\\text{(negation-related bad)}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThe other definition requires that we introduce, prior to\n\u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d, a set of neutral\npropositions. Goodness is predicated of everything that is better than\nsome neutral proposition, and badness of everything that is worse than\nsome neutral proposition. The best-known variant of this approach was\nproposed by Chisholm and Sosa (1966). According to these authors, a\nstate of affairs is indifferent if and only if it is neither better\nnor worse than its negation. Furthermore, a state of affairs is good\nif and only if it is better than some indifferent state of affairs,\nand bad if and only if some indifferent state of affairs is better\nthan it.\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\nG_I p \\leftrightarrow (\\exists q)(p\\succ q\\sim \\neg q)\n  &\\quad\\text{(indifference-related good)} \\\\\nB_I p \\leftrightarrow (\\exists q)(\\neg q\\sim q\\succ p)\n  &\\quad\\text{(indifference-related bad)}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThe negation-related and the indifference-related \u201cgood\u201d\nrespectively \u201cbad\u201d do not necessarily coincide. Both\ndefinitions have been developed with complete preference relations in\nmind, but formal models are available that do not require completeness.\n(Hansson 2001)\n\nA proposal for defining preferences in terms of the monadic predicates\nfor \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d was put forward by van\nBenthem (1982, p. 195). It assumes that goodness and badness are\ndefined in relation to an alternative set, so that for instance\n\\(G_{\\{x,y\\}}x\\) means that \\(x\\) is good among the alternatives in\n\\(\\{x,y\\}\\) and \\(B_{\\{x,z,w\\}}x\\) that \\(x\\) is bad among the\nalternatives in \\(\\{x,z,w\\}\\). This gives rise to the following\ndefinitions: \n\n\\(x \\succ y\\) if and only if\n\\(G_{\\{x,y\\}}x \\amp \\neg G_{\\{x,y\\}}y\\) \u00a0(goodness-based preference)\n\n\n\\(x \\succ y\\) if and only if\n\\(B_{\\{x,y\\}}y \\amp \\neg B_{\\{x,y\\}}x\\) \u00a0(badness-based preference)\n\n\nHowever, these two definitions are not equivalent, and neither of them\nis plausible in all cases. For instance, let \\(x\\) be good and not bad\nin the context \\(\\{x,y\\}\\), and let \\(y\\) be neither good\nnor bad in the same context. Then \\(x \\succ y\\) holds according to\nfirst definition but \\(\\neg(x \\succ y)\\) according to the second. To\navoid such problems, Hansson and Liu (2014) proposed the following\ndefinition: \n\n\\(x \\succ y\\) if and only if either\n\\(G_{\\{x,y\\}}x \\amp \\neg G_{\\{x,y\\}}y\\) or\n\\(B_{\\{x,y\\}}y \\amp \\neg B_{\\{x,y\\}}x\\) (bivalently based preference)\n\n3. Numerical Representation of Preference \n\nPreferences can be represented numerically.\n\\(A\\succ B\\) is then expressed by a set if numerical utility\nfunctions \\(\\{u_i\\}\\), each of which assigns a higher value to \\(A\\) than to\n\\(B\\), while \\(A\\sim B\\) is represented by\nassigning the same value to the two. Such numerical representations\nmight serve different purposes, one being that utility functions can\nbe analysed with the tools of maximisation under constraints, as done\nin economics. It is important, however, to stress the limitations of\nsuch representations. First, not all preferences can be represented\nnumerically. Second, there are different scales by which preferences\ncan be represented, which require premises of different strengths.\nThird, the resulting utility representation must be clearly\ndistinguished from the older hedonistic concept of utility. \n3.1 Representing preferences ordinally\n\nThe simplest form of numerical representation stipulates the following\nequivalence: \n\n\\[\nA\\succ B \\text{ iff } u(A)\\gt u(B) \\quad\\text{(Ordinal representation)}\n\\]\n\n\nAny function \\(u\\) that assigns a larger number to \\(A\\)\nthan to \\(B\\) will work as such a representation. Consequently,\nthe function \\(u\\) can be replaced with any function\nu\u2019 as long as u\u2019 is a positive\nmonotone transformation of \\(u\\). As this transformation\nproperty is the defining characteristic of ordinal scales, we\ncall this an ordinal preference representation (See the entry on\n measurement in science.)\n\nA preference relation has an ordinal representation only if it\nsatisfies both completeness and transitivity. However, even if\n\\(\\mathcal{A}\\) is finite, there can be\ncomplete and transitive preference relations on \\(\\mathcal{A}\\)\nthat cannot be represented by a utility\nfunction (for a counter-example based on a lexicographic preference\nrelation, see Debreu\n 1954).[2]\n\n\nAn incomplete preference ordering also has a value\nrepresentation of the following type:\n\n\\[\n\\text{If } A\\succ B, \\text{ then } u(A)\\gt u(B)\n\\]\n\n\nThe inverse is obviously not true. However, under fairly wide\ncircumstances, given the set of all utility functions thus\ndefined, one can find the preference relation (Aumann 1962). \n3.2 Representing preferences cardinally\n\nOrdinal numerical representations of preference are just a convenient\ntool \u2013 they do not represent any information that cannot be\nrepresented by the relation \\(\\succ\\) itself. However, there is\nrelevant information about preferences that is not represented by the\nrelation \\(\\succ\\) itself. For example, when an agent expresses two\npreferences, say \\(A\\succ B\\) and \\(C\\succ B\\), one might ask how\nmuch the agent prefers \\(A\\) to \\(B\\), in particular in\ncomparison to how much she prefers \\(C\\) to \\(B\\). To answer this\nquestion, one needs to determine both a measurement procedure for\nmeasuring preference intensities and a measurement scale for\nrepresenting these measurements. \n\nMeasurement scales that represent magnitudes of intervals between\nproperties, or even magnitudes of ratios between properties, are\ncalled cardinal scales. Although the discussion in the social\nsciences often merely distinguishes between ordinal and cardinal\npreference measures, it is important to further distinguish between\ninterval and ratio scales among the latter, as these require different\nassumptions to hold. An interval scale allows for meaningful\ncomparisons of differences (e.g. \u201c43\u00b0C is as much hotter than 41\n\u00b0C as 29\u00b0C is hotter than 27\u00b0C\u201d). In addition, a ratio\nscale also allows for meaningful comparisons of ratios (e.g. \u201c12m is twice\nas long as 6m\u201d). Although there have been some attempts to measure\npreferences on a ratio scale (in particular, see Kahneman and\nTversky\u2019s (1979) Prospect Theory, which requires a\nnatural zero point and thus a ratio scale), most efforts have focussed\non measuring preferences on an interval scale. \n\nThe basic idea of interval preference measurement is to assume that\nacts have uncertain consequences, and that each act is equivalent to a\nlottery between these outcomes. An agent who expresses a preference\nfor an act over others by choosing it thus expresses a preference for\nthe equivalent lottery over the lotteries equivalent to other acts.\nThe utilities of these acts are then determined as the expected\nutilities of the equivalent lotteries, calculated as the\nprobability-weighted average of the lottery\u2019s consequences. This\napproach was pioneered by Ramsey (1928) and refined by von Neumann and\nMorgenstern (1944); other approaches have been presented by Savage\n(1954/72) and Jeffrey (1965/90). There are substantial differences\nbetween these approaches and their respective assumptions. For more\ndetail, see\n decision theory.\n3.3 Alternative utility-based representations of preference\n\nAs mentioned in section 3.1, all transitive and complete preference\nrelations can be represented by a utility function according to the\nfollowing simple relationship\n\n\\[\nA\\succ B \\text{ iff } u(A) \\gt u(B)\n\\]\n\n\nHowever, as can be seen from the Sorites paradox discussed in section\n2.3, this recipe for the representation of preferences is too\ndemanding for some purposes. If \\(u(A)\\gt u(B)\\), but \\(u(A)-u(B)\\) is\nso small that it cannot be discerned, then \\(A\\succ B\\) cannot be\nexpected to hold. One way to represent this feature is to employ a\ncardinal utility function and to introduce a fixed limit of\nindiscernibility, such that \\(A\\succ B\\) holds if and only if\n\\(u(A)-u(B)\\) is larger than that limit. Such a limit is commonly\ncalled a just noticeable difference (JND).\n\n\\[\nA\\succ B \\text{ iff } u(A)-u(B) \\gt \\delta,\n  \\quad(\\text{JND representation, } \\delta \\gt 0)\n\\]\n\n\nIf the set of alternatives is finite, then \\(\\succcurlyeq\\) has a JND\nrepresentation if and only if \\(\\succcurlyeq\\) is complete, and\nsatisfies the two properties that for all (A, B, C, D):\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n&A\\succ B \\wedge B\\succ C \\rightarrow A\\succ D \\vee D\\succ C \\text{ and } \\\\\n\n&A\\succ B \\wedge C\\succ D \\rightarrow A\\succ D \\vee C\\succ B.\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n\nAnother interesting construction is to assign to each alternative an\ninterval instead of a single number. This requires two real-valued\nfunctions, \\(u_{max}\\) and \\(u_{min}\\), such that for all \\(A,\nu_{max}(A)\\ge u_{min}(A)\\). Here, \\(u_{max}(A)\\) represents the upper\nlimit of the interval assigned to \\(A\\), and \\(u_{min}(A)\\) its lower\nlimit. \\(A \\succ B\\) holds if and only if all elements of the interval\nassigned to \\(A\\) have higher value than all elements of the \\(B\\)\ninterval:\n\n\\[\nA\\succ B \\text{ iff } u_{min}(A)\\gt u_{max}(B) \n  \\quad\\text{(Interval representation)}\n\\]\n\n\nIt has been shown that a preference relation \\(\\succcurlyeq\\) has an\ninterval representation if and only if it satisfies completeness and\nthe property that for all \\(A, B, C, D\\):\n\n\\[\nA\\succ B \\wedge C\\succ D \\rightarrow A\\succ D \\vee C\\succ B\n\\]\n\n(Fishburn 1970).\n\nA final generalization is to let the threshold of discrimination\ndepend on both relata.\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\nA\\succ B \\text{ iff } u(A)-u(B)\\gt \\sigma(A, B) &\\quad(\\text{Doubly variable threshold}\\\\ \n &\\quad\\text{ representation } \\sigma(A,B)\\gt 0) \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n\nIf the set of alternatives is finite, then \\(\\succcurlyeq\\) has a doubly\nvariable threshold representation if and only if it satisfies\nacyclicity.\n\nFor more details on these representations, see Scott and Suppes (1958)\nand Abbas (1995).\n4. Preferences combination\n\nIn practical decision making, there are often several preference\nrelations that have to be taken into account. The different preference\nrelations represent different aspects of the subject matter concerned\nby the decision. For instance, when choosing among alternative\narchitectural designs for a new building, we will have a whole set of\naspects, each of which can be expressed with a preference relation:\ncosts, sustainability, aesthetics, fire safety etc. In other cases, the\nvarious preference relations represent the wishes or interests of\ndifferent persons. This applies for instance when a group of people\nwith different preferences plan a joint vacation trip. \n4.1 Managing preference conflicts\n\nThe most convenient way to represent problems with multiple preference\naspects is to introduce a vector \\(\\langle \\succcurlyeq_1 ,\\ldots\n,\\succcurlyeq_n \\rangle\\) whose elements are the preference relations\nwe have to take into account. For simplicity, we can assume that all\nthese preferences are complete (or we can treat incompleteness as\nindifference). We can call such a vector conflict free if and\nonly if it has no elements \\(\\succcurlyeq_k\\) and \\(\\succcurlyeq_m\\)\nsuch that \\(X \\succ_k Y\\) and \\(Y \\succ_m X\\) for any alternatives\n\\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). If \\(\\langle \\succcurlyeq_1 ,\\ldots ,\\succcurlyeq_n\n\\rangle\\) is conflict free, then we can define a combined preference\nrelation \\(\\succcurlyeq\\) such that (1) \\(X\\succ Y\\) if there is some\n\\(\\succcurlyeq_k\\) such that \\(X\\succ_k Y\\), (2) \\(Y\\succ X\\) if there\nis some \\(\\succcurlyeq_k\\) such that \\(Y\\succ_k X\\), and (3) otherwise\n\\(X\\sim Y\\). This is a plausible construction for conflict free\npreferences, since the combined preference relation does not\ncontradict any of the strict preferences expressed in the component\nvectors. \n\nFor conflictual preference vectors, i.e. vectors that are not\nconflict free, there is no such simple solution that is plausible in\nall applications. There are five common ways to deal with conflicts\namong preferences.\n\n1. Reduction to a single dimension. Such reductions are\nusually performed by first translating all preference relations into\nsome numerical value, and then, for each alternative, adding up the\nvalues assigned to it for all aspects. In utilitarian moral\nphilosophy, a fictional value unit, \u201cutile\u201d, is used for\nthis purpose. In economics, cost-benefit analysis (CBA) instead uses monetary units. However in many cases\nthere is uncertainty or disagreement on how the reductions should be\nperformed. \n\n2. Assuming that all conflicts cancel each other out. This\namounts to extending the above definition of a combined preference\nrelation so that \\(X\\sim Y\\) will hold in all cases of conflict,\ni.e. whenever there are \\(\\succcurlyeq_k\\) and \\(\\succcurlyeq_m\\) such\nthat \\(X \\succ_k Y\\) and \\(Y \\succ_m X\\). Although usually not\nexpressed in this way, this is the effect of applying efficiency as\nthe sole criterion (e.g. Pareto efficiency as the sole criterion in a\nmulti-person case). This method has the obvious disadvantage that it\nsometimes lets a small disadvantage in one dimension outweigh a large\nadvantage in another dimension. \n\n3. Majoritarian solutions. Another way to deal with conflicts\nis to look for the alternatives that are favoured by most (but not necessarily all) of the preference relations. This requires that the aspects\ncovered by the different preference relations are valued equally.\nTherefore, this solution is commonly used when the elements of the\nvector correspond to the wishes or interests of different persons, but\nnot when they correspond to more general aspects of a decision (such\nas sustainability and aesthetics in the example of of choosing an\narchitectural design). \n\n4. Intuitive weighing. In practice, decision makers often\nweigh different preference dimensions against each other intuitively,\nwithout any prior attempt to reduce the multi-dimensionality of the\ndecision. This way of dealing with multiple preferences has practical\nadvantages, but it also has the disadvantage of lacking efficient\nmechanisms for ensuring consistency in decision-making. \n\n5. Modifying at least one of the conflicting preference\nrelations. This is what happens when people involved in\nnegotiations or discussions approach each other\u2019s views in ways that\nmake their preference relations less conflicting. The Delphi method is\na systematized procedure that can be used to reduce interindividual\ndifferences in preferences. On an intraindividual level, strivings for\na reflective equilibrium can take the form of adjusting preference\nrelations that concern different aspects of an issue to each\nother. From a psychological point of view, such changes can be\ndescribed as reductions of cognitive dissonance in value issues.\n\nVoting procedures are often described as methods for aggregating or\ncombining preferences. Such aggregation can also be performed by a\nbenevolent planner striving to take the wishes and/or interests of all\nconcerned persons into account. The aggregation of preferences is a\nmajor topic of social choice theory. See the entry on \n social choice theory.\n4.2 Total and partial preferences\n\nConsider again the choice among alternative architectural designs for\na new building. As indicated above, our preferences can be expressed\nwith a vector \\(\\langle \\succcurlyeq_1 ,\\ldots ,\\succcurlyeq_n\n\\rangle\\), each of whose elements represents our partial\npreferences with respect to some particular aspect such as\nsustainability or aesthetics. If we manage to aggregate the vector to\na single preference relation \\(\\succcurlyeq\\), then \\(\\succcurlyeq\\)\nrepresents our total preferences, or, as they are also\ncalled, our \u201cpreferences tout court\u201d or\n\u201cpreferences all things considered\u201d. \n\nSome authors have argued that the preference notion in economics\nalways refers to total preferences (Hausman 2012). However, there are\nalso economists who recognize partial preferences, often identifying\nthem with preferences over properties or characteristics of economic\ngoods (Lancaster 1966). In contrast, philosophers often treat partial\npreferences as referring to different reasons that one may have to\nprefer one of the options to another (Pettit 1991, Osherson and\nWeinstein 2012). \n\nAuthors who recognize partial preferences usually give them priority,\nand consider total preferences to be completely determined by the\npartial preferences. In other words, they assume that a total\npreference relation is uniquely determined by the partial preference\nrelations through a process of aggregation. There are different views\non the nature of this process. According to a quantitative\napproach, each partial preference is connected with a cardinal partial\nutility function for the aspect in question, and the total preference\nrelation can be obtained by aggregating these partial utility\nfunctions using an appropriate set of weights. This requires strong\nassumptions of preference independence in order to justify additivity\nof utility (Keeney and Raiffa 1993). \n\nAn alternative strategy employs tools from social choice\ntheory to map a vector of partial preferences into a total\npreference relation. This approach only makes use of ordinal\ninformation, and disregards any utility information that has no impact\non the partial preference relations. Unsurprisingly, the impossibility\nresults of social choice theory affect this method. Steedman and\nKrause (1986) have shown that there is no rule for deriving total\npreferences from a preference vector that satisfies four seemingly\nplausible conditions and also yields a transitive and complete total\npreference ordering. When applied to an intrapersonal conflict this\nmeans that an agent may be rational in the sense of having a complete\nand transitive (partial) relation for each of the aspects, but may\nstill be irrational either in the sense of not satisfying plausible\nconditions on the relations between partial and total preferences, or\nin the sense of not having a complete and transitive total preference\nordering for her overall appraisal of the options in question. This\nargument connects with a long philosophical tradition, including Plato\nand Bishop Butler, that draws an analogy between intrapersonal\nconflicts and citizens\u2019 conflicting preferences within a state.\n\n\nThere are also authors who reject the idea that total preferences are\nuniquely derivable from partial preferences. Instead they claim that\ntotal preferences are constructed at the moment of\nelicitation, and thus influenced by contexts and framings of the\nelicitation procedure that are not encoded in pre-existing partial\npreferences (Payne, Bettman and Johnson 1993). Total preferences seem\nto be influenced by direct affective responses that are independent of\ncognitive processes (Zajone 1980). For instance, food preferences seem\nto be partly determined by habituation and are therefore difficult to\nexplain as the outcome of a process exclusively based on well-behaved\npartial preferences. According to this view, partial preferences are\nin many cases ex post rationalisations of total preferences,\nrather than the basis from which total preferences are derived. \n\nA closely related standpoint was expressed by Nozick (1981, 244):\n\u201cReasons do not come with previously assigned weights; the\ndecision process is not one of discovering such precise weights but of\nassigning them. The process not only weighs reasons, it (also) weights\nthem.\u201d According to Kranz (1991, 34), \u201c[p]eople do and\nshould act as problem solvers, not maximizers, because they have\nmany different and incommensurable \u2026 goals to achieve\u201d.\nMuch in the same vein, Levi (1986, 246) maintained that \u201can\nagent may terminate deliberation and take decisions without having\nresolved the moral, political, economic and aesthetic conflicts\nrelevant to their predicaments\u201d. \n5. Preferences and choice\n\nThere is a strong tradition, particularly in economics, to relate\npreference to choice. Preference is linked to hypothetical choice, and\nchoice to revealed preference. We begin this section by presenting\nchoice functions and some of their main properties. We then proceed to\ndiscuss how choice functions and their properties can be derived from\npreferences. Finally, we view the relationship from the other end, and\nintroduce some approaches to inferring preferences from observed\nchoices.\n5.1 Choice functions and their properties\n\nGiven an alternative set \\(\\mathcal{A}\\), we can represent\n(hypothetical) choice as a function \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) that, for any given\nsubset \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) of \\(\\mathcal{A}\\), delivers those elements of\n\\(\\mathcal{B}\\) that a deliberating agent has not ruled out for\nchoice. For brevity\u2019s sake we will call them \u2018chosen\nelements\u2019. The formal definition of a choice function is as\nfollows:\n\n\n\\(\\mathbf{C}\\) is a choice function for \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) if and only if\nit is a function such that for all \\(\\mathcal{B} \\subseteq\n\\mathcal{A}\\):\n\n\\(\\mathbf{C}(\\mathcal{B}) \\subseteq\n\\mathcal{B}\\), and\nif \\(\\mathcal{B} \\ne \\varnothing\\), then\n\\(\\mathbf{C}(\\mathcal{B}) \\ne \\varnothing\\).\n\n\n\nA large number of rationality properties have been proposed for choice\nfunctions. The two most important of these are described here.\n\n\\[\n\\text{If } \\mathcal{B} \\subseteq \\mathcal{A} \\text{ then }\n\\mathcal{B} \\cap \\mathbf{C}(\\mathcal{A})\n\\subseteq \\mathbf{C}(\\mathcal{B})\n\\quad\\text{(Property } \\alpha, \\text{ \u201cChernoff\u201d)}\n\\]\n\n\nThis property states that if some element of a subset \\(\\mathcal{B}\\)\nof \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) is chosen from \\(\\mathcal{A}\\), then it is also\nchosen from \\(\\mathcal{B}\\). According to property \\(\\alpha\\),\nremoving some of the alternatives that are not chosen does not\ninfluence choice. This property has often been assumed to hold, but\ncounterarguments have been raised against it. Consider the following\nexample. Erna is invited to an acquaintance\u2019s house for\ndinner. Her choice for dessert is between an apple (which is the last\npiece of fruit in the fruit basket) \\((X)\\) and nothing instead\n\\((Y)\\). Because Erna is polite, she chooses \\(Y\\). Had she faced a\nchoice between an apple \\((X)\\), nothing \\((Y)\\) and an orange\n\\((Z)\\), she would have taken the apple. Thus her choices are:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{C}(\\{X,Y,Z\\}) =\\{X\\}\n\\]\n\n\nand\n\n\\[\\mathbf{C}(\\{X,Y\\}) =\\{Y\\},\n\\]\n\n\nwhich violate property \\(\\alpha\\). More generally, property \\(\\alpha\\) has\nbeen contested with reference to cases when alternatives are preferred\nfor their position in an alternative set, when the set of alternatives\nitself constitutes important information about the alternative chosen,\nor when certain alternatives provide the chooser with the freedom to\nreject them (Sen 1993,\n 501\u2013503).[3]\n\nThe second property states that if \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are both\nchosen from the subset \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) of \\(\\mathcal{A}\\),\nthen one of them cannot be chosen in \\(\\mathcal{A}\\)\nwithout the other also being chosen.\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\text{If } &\\mathcal{B} \\subseteq \\mathcal{A}\n\\text{ and } X, Y \\in \\mathbf{C}(\\mathcal{B}), \\text{ then }\nX \\in \\mathbf{C}(\\mathcal{A}) \\\\\n&\\text{ iff } Y \\in \\mathbf{C}(\\mathcal{A}) \n  \\quad(\\text{Property } \\beta)\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nTo exemplify property \\(\\beta\\), suppose that we have three\nrestaurants, \\(X, Y\\) and \\(Z\\), within walking distance, and two\nadditional restaurants, \\(V\\) and \\(W\\), that we can reach by\ncar. Furthermore, suppose that we begin by choosing among the\nrestaurants within walking distance. We agree that the choice is\nbetween \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), but we find no reasons to choose one of them\nrather than the other, i.e. \\(\\mathbf{C}(\\{X, Y, Z\\})=\\{X,Y\\}\\). \nThen we find out that we do in fact have access to a car.\nProperty \\(\\beta\\) says that if \\(X\\) is one of the chosen restaurants\nin this situation, then so is \\(Y\\), and vice versa.  In other words:\n\\(X\\in \\mathbf{C}(\\{X, Y, Z, V, W\\})\\) holds if and only if \\(Y \\in\n\\mathbf{C}(\\{X, Y, Z, V, W\\})\\). \n\nA third property, \\(\\gamma\\), is described in\n footnote.[4]\n\n\nThe above properties are mainly found in the social choice literature.\nA related property in the economic literature is the so-called\nWeak Axiom of Revealed Preferences (WARP). It says that if\n\\(X\\) is chosen when \\(Y\\) is available, then there must not\nbe an alternative set \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) containing both\nalternatives for which \\(Y\\) is chosen and \\(X\\) is not.\n\n\nIf \\(X,Y\\in \\mathcal{A}\\) and \\(X\\in \\mathbf{C}(\\mathcal{A})\\), then\nfor all \\(\\mathcal{B}\\), if \\(X\\in \\mathcal{B}\\), and \\(Y\\in\n\\mathbf{C}(\\mathcal{B})\\), then \\(X\\in \\mathbf{C}(\\mathcal{B})\\)\n\u00a0\u00a0(WARP)\n\n\nWARP is equivalent to the combination of properties \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\)\n(Sen 1971, 50). A stronger version, SARP, is discussed in the first\npart of the supplementary document.\n\nThe Strong Axiom of Revealed Preference\n\n\nCounterexamples have been offered to show that these properties are\nnot plausible in all situations. Consider an agent who chooses to stay\nat a friend\u2019s house for a cup of tea \\((T)\\) rather than to go\nhome \\((H)\\), but who leaves in a hurry when the friend offers a\nchoice between tea and cocaine \\((C)\\) at his next visit. Then\n\\(\\mathbf{C}(\\{T,H\\}) =\\{T\\}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{C}(\\{T,H,C\\}) =\\{H\\}\\),\nand hence the visitor violates both properties \\(\\alpha\\) and\n\\(\\beta\\). \n5.2 Determining choice from preference\n\nA choice function that is defined on the basis of a preference\nrelation is called relational (also binary). The\nmost obvious way to construct a choice function from a preference\nrelation \\(\\succcurlyeq\\) is to have the function always choose the elements\nthat are best according to \\(\\succcurlyeq\\):\n\nThe best choice connection\n\\(\\mathbf{C}^B(\\mathcal{B}) = \\{X \\in \\mathcal{B} \\mid\n\\forall Y \\in \\mathcal{B}: (X\\succcurlyeq Y)\\}\\) \n\n\n\\(\\mathbf{C}^B\\) is a choice function (i.e. satisfies the defining\ncriteria for a choice function given in section 5.1) if and only if\n\\(\\succcurlyeq\\) is complete and acyclical. It will then also satisfy\nproperties \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\gamma\\). Furthermore, \\(\\mathbf{C}^B\\)\nsatisfies property \\(\\beta\\) if and only if \\(\\succcurlyeq\\) is\ntransitive and complete (Sen 1970a, 19).\n\nWhen the underlying preference relation is incomplete, there may not\nbe an element that is preferred to all other elements. A function\n\\(\\mathbf{C}\\) constructed according to the best choice connection\nwill then be empty, and hence not a choice function. To avoid this, an\nalternative connection constructs the choice function as choosing\nthose elements that are not dispreferred to any other elements of the\nset:\n\nThe non-dominance choice connection\n\\(\\mathbf{C}^L(\\mathcal{B}) = \\{X \\in \\mathcal{B} \\mid\n\\forall Y \\in \\mathcal{B}: \\neg(Y\\succ X)\\}\\)\n\n\n\\(\\mathbf{C}^L\\) is a choice function if and only if \\(\\succcurlyeq\\)\nis acyclical. It will then satisfy properties \\(\\alpha\\) and\n\\(\\gamma\\). Furthermore, \\(\\mathbf{C}^L\\) satisfies property \\(\\beta\\)\nif and only if \\(\\succcurlyeq\\) is transitive and complete (Herzberger\n1973).\n\nWhen the preference relation over \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) is cyclical, neither\n\\(\\mathbf{C}^B\\) nor \\(\\mathbf{C}^L\\) may be a relational choice\nfunction for \\(\\mathcal{A}\\). In the simplest case, with a cyclical\npreference \\(A\\succ B\\succ C\\succ A\\), \\(\\mathbf{C}^B(A,B,C) =\n\\mathbf{C}^L(A,B,C) = \\varnothing\\). Schwarz (1972) therefore proposes\na third relational choice function, which operates even on the basis\nof cyclical preferences.  Its basic idea is to select elements that\nare not dominated by non-cyclical preference.\n5.3 Inferring preference from choice\n\nThe close connections between preference axioms and choice axioms can\nalso be employed to construct a preference ordering from a choice\nfunction that satisfies certain axioms. In economics, the revealed\npreference approach has been used to define preference in terms\nof choice. Historically, this approach developed out of the pursuit of\nbehaviouristic foundations for economic theories\u2014i.e. the\nattempt to eliminate the preference framework altogether. Today, it\nserves to derive preference orderings from an agent\u2019s observed\nchoices, and to test the empirical validity of the preference axioms\nby testing for the violation of choice axioms (Gr\u00fcne-Yanoff\n2004).\n\nThere are many ways to construct preference relations from observed\nchoices. The simplest method defines an alternative \\(X\\) as \u201cat\nleast as good as\u201d an alternative \\(Y\\) if and only if\n\\(X\\) is chosen from some set of alternatives that also contains\n\\(Y\\).\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\tag{1}\nX\\succcurlyeq^S Y &\\text{ iff for some }\n  \\mathcal{B}, X\\in \\mathbf{C}(\\mathcal{B}) \\text{ and } Y\\in \\mathcal{B} \\\\\n\nX\\succ^S Y &\\text{ iff } X\\succcurlyeq^S Y \\text{ and not } \n  Y\\succcurlyeq^S X \\\\\n\nX\\sim^S Y &\\text{ iff } X\\succcurlyeq^S Y \\text{ and }\n  Y\\succcurlyeq^S X\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nIf the choice function is defined over all subsets of \\(\\mathcal{B},\n\\succcurlyeq^S\\) is complete.  \\(\\succ^S\\) does not necessarily\nsatisfy transitivity of strict preference, transitivity of\nindifference, IP- or PI-transitivity. Two further methods are\ndescribed in the supplementary document:\n\nThe Strong Axiom of Revealed Preference\n\n\nThe formal relation to choice raises the question of the ontological status of preferences. Are preferences prior to choices, and function potentially as their cause? Or are preferences merely representations of actual or potential choice patterns? Debates about how to interpret preferences in economics have a long history, and in recent years the topic has received renewed attention. This discussion tended to focus on an opposition between behaviourist vs. mentalist interpretations. Many (but certainly not all) economists have interpreted the dominant revealed preference theory in behaviourist terms, claiming for example that \u201cStandard economics does not address mental processes, and as a result, economic abstractions are typically not appropriate for describing them\u201d (Gul and Pesendorfer 2008, 21). Consequently, these authors take the formal relations presented in this section as the determinants of the ontological question what preferences are. Furthermore, they also reject the interpretation of preferences as causes of choice, instead insisting that they only capture choice patterns (Binmore 2008, 19\u201322).\n\nMentalists, in contrast, insist that choices and preferences are\nentities of quite different categories: Preferences are states of\nmind whereas choices are actions. Consequently, they\nreject the strong behaviourist program (Hausman 2012). An important\nmentalist argument against behaviourist interpretations concerns the\nrole of beliefs in decision making. According to this argument, some\nchoices are not based on stable preferences over actions, but are\nconstructed from more basic cognitive and evaluative elements. A\nsimple choice \u2013 like choosing between two pieces of\ncandy \u2013 might be based on a preference for a world in which\none eats candy \\(X\\) over a world in which one eats candy \\(Y\\). But\nmore complex choices \u2013 e.g. choosing one\u2019s higher\neducation \u2013 depend on what one believes these choices to\nbring about, and how one evaluates these consequences. In those cases,\na more complex framework specifies beliefs about the probability or\nplausibility of possible states of the world, preferences over the\nconsequences of choices in those worlds, and an aggregation mechanism\nof these preferences under those beliefs. The need for such a\ncognitive structure to account for preferences has been proposed as an\nargument against the ontological reduction of preferences to choices\n(Hausman (2012).\n\nAnother argument against behaviourist interpretations points to the\napparent existence of preferences over alternatives that one cannot\nchoose between \u2013 for example preferences for winning a\ncertain prize of a lottery, or for particular configurations of\nParadise. This contradicts the claim that preferences exclusively\ntranspire from choices. One way to substantiate preferences over\nalternatives that one cannot choose between is to ask people what they\nprefer. Their answers can be interpreted as further choice\nevidence \u2013 as verbal or writing behaviour. This\ninterpretation treats their answers on a par with all other forms of\nbehaviour. Alternatively, their answers can be interpreted\nas introspective reports. This interpretation treats answers\nas agents\u2019 privileged access to their own minds.  Furthermore,\nmentalists also distinguish between those agents who indeed have\npreferences as states of minds \u2013 e.g. humans, and maybe\nhigher animals \u2013 and those agents who do\nnot \u2013 e.g. machines, plants or institutions. The former\ncategory may choose on the basis of their preferences, and hence the\nabove-discussed effort can aim at eliciting the preferences on which\ntheir choices are based. The latter category, despite their lack of\nstates of mind, may nevertheless exhibit behaviour that can be\ninterpreted as relational choice.\n\nFunctionalists\u2019 accounts of preferences deny such an\nintrinsically mental interpretation of preferences, without reducing\nthem to behaviour. In functionalism, the nature of preferences, like\nthat of other mental states, is determined by what roles they play\n\u2013 e.g. in evaluating choice alternatives, and in motivating\nactions. Yet who assigns these roles, and what justifies such\nassignments? Most authors agree that it is \u201cthe ontological\ncommitments of our best theory or theories in the relevant area\u201d\nthat perform this assignment (List and Dietrich 2016, 257). How\npreferences are individuated, then, is dependent on the purposes for\nascribing them. For example, revealed preferences are considered real\nif they are non-redundantly useful for describing regularities in an\nindividual\u2019s behaviour:\n\nTo show that RPT [revealed preference theory] is useful we must find\nsome real structures that are usefully measured \u2013 where\n\u201cusefully\u201d means nonredundantly relevant to explanation\nand prediction\u2013using coefficients and relations defined by its\naxioms. (Ross 2005, 143)\n\n\nRevealed preference theory is nonredundantly relevant, Ross claims,\nbecause it makes sense of patterns like intentionality and agency that\ndon\u2019t reduce to physical patterns. To the extent that this is\nnot merely a predictive but an explanatory task, one needs to admit\nthe existence of these patterns, thus endorsing \u201cintentional\nstance functionalism without sliding into instrumentalism\u201d (Ross\n2005, 143\u20134). According to such a view, preferences are\nidentified by the causal roles they play in generating human, animal\nand machine behaviour; and they are real to the extent that the best\ntheories of such behaviour require their attribution.\n\nRecently, some authors have sought to dissolve the simple dialectic\nbetween mentalism and behaviourism. Guala (2019, 389) argues that the\ndebate is mainly motivated by a methodological, rather than an\nontological concern: whether or not economics should accept a healthy\ninjection of psychological theory and methods depends on the\nexplanatory tasks at hand. Clark (2020) reasons that whether and how\nto treat preferences as genuine cognitive variables is a question that\ndepends on the epistemic purposes of the investigation (or as he\nphrased it, \u201cthe ultimate aims of economics\u201d). Similarly,\nThoma (2021) and Vredenburgh (2020) argue that for their specific\npurposes, economists often have good reasons to largely \u201cblack\nbox\u201d the causes of choice in their modelling of economic\nbehaviour.\n6. Preference and welfare\n\nPreference relates to welfare in rather intricate ways. Welfare is a\nfundamental concept in moral philosophy and economics. It refers to\nthe fundamental good for individual human beings, and it is therefore\nan anthropocentric and individualist concept. In order to clarify the\nrelationship between preference and welfare we need to distinguish\nbetween three variants of the concept of welfare. \n\nAccording to the material view, a person\u2019s welfare is a\nmatter of her material conditions, such as access to food, shelter,\nhealthcare and, generally speaking, the necessities and perhaps\nluxuries of life. This view of welfare has been criticized for being\nmaterialistic in the sense of pursuing material possessions at the\nexpense of higher values. It also has to face the difficulties\ninherent in weighing different material goods against each other. \n\nThe other two principal views both treat welfare as a mental rather\nthan a material issue. The wish-based mental view uses each\nperson\u2019s wishes (i.e. preferences in the informal sense of that\nword) as the criterion of welfare (Sen 1979). A person is considered\nto have more welfare, the more her wishes are satisfied. If this view\nis applied within a utilitarian framework, then it gives rise to\npreference utilitarianism. This view of welfare has difficulties in\ndealing with misinformed and self-defeating wishes. It can also have\ndifficulties with certain types of other-regarding wishes, e.g.\nmalevolent ones. The usual way to deal with this is to require that\npreferences are filtered (\u201claundered\u201d) and/or refined\nbefore they are used to judge a person\u2019s welfare. \n\nThe filtering (\u201claundering\u201d) of preferences can be\njustified by the everyday experience that some preferences are much\nmore important for a person\u2019s well-being than others. It can be\nargued that a plausible preference-based account of welfare cannot be\nbased on total preferences, but would have to be based on a subset of\n\u201ccore\u201d preferences that are important for the individual.\nThe determination of that subset is expectedly contentious. If it is\nto be determined by others than the individual whose welfare is\nconcerned, then problems of paternalism will be difficult to avoid.\n\n\nRefinement of preferences is usually assumed to result in the\nperson\u2019s (hypothetical) \u201crational\u201d or \u201cideally\nconsidered\u201d preferences. \u201cMy ideally considered\npreferences are those I would have if I were to engage in\nthoroughgoing deliberation about my preferences with full pertinent\ninformation, in a calm mood, while thinking clearly and making no\nreasoning errors.\u201d (Arneson 1989, 83; cf. Brandt 1979 and Rosati 2009) A problem\nfor this view is that there does not seem to be any easy way to\ndetermine, based on a person\u2019s preferences and circumstances,\nwhat her ideally considered preferences would be. \n\nFinally, the state-dependent mental view identifies a\nperson\u2019s welfare with some mental state such as happiness or\nsatisfaction. It is assumed that the relevant states of mind can at\nleast in principle be judged by external assessors. If such a view is\napplied within a utilitarian framework, then it can give rise to\nhedonistic utilitarianism. This view can be criticized for paternalism\nand for being uncritical towards arrangements in which individuals are\nhappy in spite of being oppressed or deprived. Furthermore, the\ndifficulties involved in comparing mental properties such as happiness\nin different persons creates a problem for views that depend on such\ncomparisons for the determination of welfare. However, recent work on\nthe measurement of happiness and life satisfaction has challenged that\nview, and may have opened up new avenues for research in both\neconomics and moral philosophy. (Ng 1997) \n\nOnly one of these three views, namely the wish-based one, refers to\nwhat we usually call preferences. However, the other two can also be\nexpressed in terms of preference (betterness) relations. We can use\nsuch relations to order material conditions respectively mental states\nin terms of how they satisfy the criteria of welfare that we have\nchosen to apply. It is important to distinguish between on the one\nhand preferences in the common sense of comparative likings, and on\nthe other hand the use of a preference relation to express grades of\nany property whose structure satisfies the common formal requirement\nof such a relation. \n\nA common problem for attempts to account for welfare in terms of\npreference is that we expect a person\u2019s view of her own welfare\nto be essentially self-regarding, but her preferences can refer to\nconcerns that are not self-regarding, such as her concerns for other\npeople, her views on social justice, and her commitments for instance\nto traditions, conventions, and moral ideas (Sen 1977). Our choices\nare influenced by this wide range of preferences. Therefore, it does\nnot seem possible to link preferences strongly to welfare and at the\nsame time link them strongly to choice. \n7. Preference change\n\nPreferences relate to time in several ways. Preference at one point in\ntime can refer to what happens or happened at other points in time.\nFurthermore, preferences can change over time, due to changes in\nbeliefs, values, tastes, or a combination of these. Section 7.1\nexplains why preference change requires explanatory and theoretical\n treatment. In the following sections, three types of explanatory models are\ndiscussed. (For more detail, see Gr\u00fcne-Yanoff and Hansson 2009.) \nTime preference models (section 7.2) only refer to\nthe temporal relationship between the occurrence of a preference and\nthe objects it refers to. Doxastic change models (section\n7.3) investigate how a change of an agent\u2019s beliefs leads to a\nchange in her preferences. Valuational change models (section\n7.4) investigate how a change in an agent\u2019s basic evaluations\nleads to a change in her preferences.\n7.1 Evidence for preference change\n\nSome authors have argued that preference change is only a superficial\nperception, and that the underlying preferences remain stable over\ntime. But there are at least four arguments to the effect that\npeople\u2019s preferences really do change over time. First, many\nsuccessful explanations of behavioural change have interpreted the\nempirical behavioural evidence as preference change. These\nexplanations can be differentiated into models of external\ninfluences and models of internal coherence. External\ninfluence models attempt to establish general links between external\nevents and agents\u2019 preference formations. They include, for\nexample, social imitation (Leibenstein 1950), parental influence\n(Cavalli-Sforza 1973), habit formation (Pollack 1976), and the effect\nof production patterns on consumption (Duesenberry 1949). Internal\ncoherence models take certain external influences as given, and model\npreference change as an accommodation of these external influences.\nThey include, for example, religious convictions (Iannaccone 1990) and\nthe effect of cognitive dissonance on preferences (Elster 1982).\n\nA second argument for preference change is based on the correlations\nbetween physiological changes and changes in behaviour. Changes in\nblood sugar levels, for example, are correlated to feeding behaviour,\nsexual behaviour varies with hormonal changes, and many behavioural\npatterns change with increasing age (for references and discussion,\nsee Loewenstein 1996). These correlations are not deterministic; such\nbehavioural changes can be resisted in many cases. It is plausible to\nincorporate these potential physiological effects as visceral\npreferences in the general preference framework, and to treat the\nrelevant physiological changes as closely connected with preference\nchanges.\n\nThird, most humans have introspective evidence for their own\npreferences changing over time. The favourite activities of a child\nare replaced by new pleasures as we grow up. Thus was the experience\nof Shakespeare\u2019s Benedick: \u201c\u2026but doth not the\nappetite alter? A man loves the meat in his youth that he cannot\nendure in his age\u201d (Much ado about nothing Act II,\nScene III). Even in adult life, we are literally overcome by sudden\nand very radical (\u201ctransformative\u201d) changes of preference. Paul (2014) has investigated the types of decision-making that this involves. It would be strange to\nclaim in such cases that it is only our beliefs about the different types of\nactivities that change. Explanations in terms of preference change are\nmuch more in line with how we spontaneously interpret our experiences\nof such changes.\n\nLast, certain concepts like taste refinement or self-restraint cannot\neasily be understood without a notion of real preference change. In\nparticular, self-restraint presupposes that the motivational\ncomponents of one\u2019s self can change, for example, through\nmaturation or social influence; and that one can and should plan\none\u2019s future self by curbing certain appetites or by designing\nthe environment in ways that affect one\u2019s preferences.\n7.2 Time preferences\n\nThe value that we assign to obtaining an advantage or disadvantage\nusually varies with the point in time when we obtain it. In typical\ncases, values decrease with time. For instance, most of us would\nprefer receiving a large sum of money now to receiving it five years\nlater. Analytically, this temporal factor of evaluations is often\nseparated from time-independent factors of evaluations.\n\nThe standard approach to this issue in economic analysis treats\npreference as based on value. Value is dealt with in a bifactorial\nmodel, in which the value of a future good is assumed to be equal to\nthe product of two factors. One of these factors is a time-independent\nevaluation of the good in question, i.e. the value of obtaining it\nimmediately. The other factor represents the subject\u2019s pure time\npreferences. It is a function of the length of the delay, and is the\nsame for all types of goods. The most common type of time preference\nfunction can be written\n\n\\[\nv(A,t) = \\frac{v(A,t_0)}{(1 + r)^{t-t_0}}\n\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(r\\) is a discount rate and \\(t-t_0\\) the duration of the\ndelay. This is the exponetentially discounted utility model (DU), proposed by\nSamuelson (1937), which still dominates in economic analysis.\n\nThe choice of a discount rate can have a large impact on the\ncalculated values. It is therefore often politically controversial. As\none example of this, the discount rate used in assessing the economic\neffects of climate change can have significant consequences for the\npolicy recommendations that are based on these assessments.\n\nThere is some evidence that the standard discounted utility model\ndoes not adequately represent human behaviour. For a simple example,\nconsider a person who prefers one apple today to two apples tomorrow,\nbut yet (today) prefers two apples in 51 days to one apple in 50 days.\nAlthough this is a plausible preference pattern, it is incompatible\nwith the exponentially discounted utility model. It can\nhowever be accounted for in a bifactorial model with a declining\ndiscount rate. Pioneered by Ainslie (1992), psychologists and\nbehavioural economists have therefore proposed to replace\nSamuelson\u2019s exponential discounting model with a model of\nhyperbolic discounting. The hyperbolic model discounts the future\nconsumption with a parameter inversely proportional to the delay of\nthe consumption, and can therefore cover examples like the above. \n\nOther deviations from the discounted utility model have also been\ndemonstrated. Experimental evidence indicates that we tend to discount\ngains more than losses, and small amounts more than large amounts.\nDiscount rates also differ between different goods (such as money and\nhealth). For some\u2014but only some\u2014types of goods, improving\nsequences of outcomes are preferred to declining sequences. For instance, many would prefer an increasing rather than a decreasing living standard across their work life. These are\nall patterns that cannot be handled in the bifactorial model with its\nobject-independent time preferences (Loewenstein et al 2002). Given\nthe empirical evidence, it is an open question whether the concept of\n\u201ctime preferences\u201d is at all descriptively adequate.\n\nIt is a separate question whether pure time preferences are rational.\nCritics argue that one should want one\u2019s life, as a\nwhole, to go as well as possible, and that counting some parts of\nlife more than others interferes with this goal (Pigou, 1920; Ramsey,\n1928b; Rawls 1971). According to this view, it is irrational to prefer\na smaller immediate good to a greater future good, because now and\nlater are equally parts of one life. Choosing the smaller good or the\ngreater bad makes one\u2019s life, as a whole, turn out worse:\n\u201cRationality requires an impartial concern for all parts of our\nlife. The mere difference of location in time, of something\u2019s\nbeing earlier or later, is not a rational ground for having more or\nless regard for it\u201d (Rawls 1971, 293). Critics of pure temporal\npreferences often attribute apparent departures from temporal\nneutrality to a cognitive illusion (which causes people to\nsee future pleasures or pains in some diminished form) or to a\nweakness of will (which causes people to choose options\nagainst their better judgment).\n\nAgainst the temporal neutrality of preferences, some have argued that\nthere is no enduring, irreducible entity over time to whom all future\nutility can be ascribed; they deny that all parts of one\u2019s\nfuture are equally parts of oneself (Parfit 1984). They\nargue, instead, that a person is a succession of overlapping selves\nrelated to varying degrees by memories, physical continuities, and\nsimilarities of character and interests, etc. By this view, it may be\njust as rational to discount one\u2019s \u201cown\u201d future\npreferences, as to discount the preferences of another distinct\nindividual, because the divisions between the stages of one\u2019s\nlife may be as \u201cdeep\u201d as the distinctions between\nindividuals.\n \nIf pure time preferences are rational, the question arises whether\nthey are rationally required to adopt a certain form. Economists\nwidely consider the EDU model to be the rational standard, to the\nextent that hyperbolic discounting is considered an indicator of\nirrationality worthy of policy intervention (Strotz 1956,\nO\u2019Donoghue and Rabin 2015). Samuelson (1937, 160), the inventor\nof the EDU, was more cautious:\n\nany connection between utility as discussed here and any welfare\nconcept is disavowed. The idea that such a [mathematical]\ninvestigation could have any influence upon ethical judgments of\npolicy is one which deserves the impatience of modern\neconomists.\n\nRecently, some authors developed critiques of the normative validity\nof EDU. Hedden (2015) argues that defending EDU would force one to\nmake untestable distinctions between actual and ultimate\npreferences. Callender (2021, see also replies in this special issue)\nargues that EDU is not a universally valid standard, but instead is\ndependent on contextual factors as yet unspecified; and that many of\nthe current policy recommendations derived from this purported\nnormative standard are questionable. \n\nA quite different critical approach to discounting is connected with\nthe idea of sustainability. If sustainability is interpreted as\nmeaning that future generations should have access to the same\nresources as those that the present generation has at its disposal,\nthen sustainability is sure to be in conflict with economic policies\nbased on exponential discounting. However, there are also views on\nsustainability that allow us to use up natural resources if we replace\nthem by non-natural resources such as new technologies that will\ncompensate for the loss. Such a \u201cweak\u201d notion of\nsustainability appears to be compatible with policies based on\ndiscounting of future effects, but it has been criticized for putting future generations at disadvantage. (Ng 2005)\n7.3 Doxastic preference change\n\nTwo kinds of beliefs are especially important for doxastic models. The\nfirst is the belief that the presence of state \\(X\\) makes a\ndesired state \\(Y\\) more likely. Take for example the belief that\nfluoride prevents dental cavities. This can lead a person to prefer\nfluoride toothpaste to others. If she comes to disbelieve this\nconnection, she may well abandon this preference. More generally, if\n\\(X\\wedge Y\\) is preferred to\n\\(X\\wedge \\neg Y\\), then a rise of the probability that\n\\(Y\\) given \\(X\\) will result in a rise in the desirability\nof \\(X\\), and vice versa.\n\nThe second kind of belief relevant for doxastic preference change\nconcerns prospects that influence the preference for other prospects\nwithout being probabilistically related. For example, one\u2019s\npreference for winning a trip to Florida in the lottery will crucially\ndepend on one\u2019s belief about the weather there during the\nspecified travel time, even though these two prospects are\nprobabilistically unrelated. More generally, if\n\\(X\\wedge Y\\) is preferred to\n\\(X\\wedge \\neg Y\\), with \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\)\nprobabilistically not correlated, then a rise of the probability that\n\\(X\\) will result in a rise in the desirability of \\(Y\\)\n(even if it does not affect the probability of \\(Y)\\), and vice\nversa.\n\nJeffrey (1977) provides a simple model of preference change as the\nconsequence of an agent coming to believe a proposition \\(A\\) to\nbe true. His model incorporates both kinds of belief relevant for\ndoxastic preference change. It is based on the notion of conditional\npreferences. Jeffrey treats preferences as a relation over\npropositions, viz. sets of possible worlds. They are represented by a\nutility function \\(\\mathbf{U}\\) (see section 2), such that:\n\n\\[\nX\\succcurlyeq Y \\text{ iff } \\mathbf{U}(X) \\ge \\mathbf{U}(Y).\n\\]\n\n\n\\(\\mathbf{U}(X)\\) in turn is defined as the probability-weighted\naverage of the utility \\(u\\) of all the possible worlds \\(w\\) in which\n\\(X\\) is true. For unconditional preferences the weighing is built on\nthe probability function \\(P\\) that represents the agent\u2019s\nactual information. The conditional preference ordering\n\\(\\succcurlyeq_A\\), in contrast, is based on \\(P_A\\), the probability\ndistribution representing the counterfactual scenario that the agent\naccepts proposition \\(A\\) as true. (For more discussion on the\nexistence and uniqueness conditions of conditional preferences, see\nLuce and Krantz 1971, Joyce 1999, chapter 4, Bradley 1999). Jeffrey\nshows that the posterior utility function \\(\\mathbf{U}_A\\) is related\nto the prior utility function \\(\\mathbf{U}\\) as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{U}_A (X) = \\mathbf{U}(A\\cap X)\n\\]\n\n\nConditional preferences allow modelling doxastic preference change.\nWhat matters for an agent\u2019s evaluation and behaviour are his\nunconditional preferences, \\(\\succcurlyeq_t\\), which are\nunconditional only in the sense that they rely on the agent\u2019s\nactual information at time \\(t\\). When the agent accepts a new\nproposition \\(A\\) at time \\(t+1\\), his\nconditional-on-\\(A\\) preferences become his unconditional\npreferences at \\(t+1\\): \\(\\succcurlyeq_{t+1} = \\succcurlyeq_{A}.\\)\n\nJeffrey\u2019s model is restricted in two ways. First, it requires an\nunchanging evaluative function \\(u\\) defined over the atoms of the\npropositional space, viz. possible worlds. Thus for all doxastically\nchanged preference orderings, the preferences over worlds remain\nidentical. Second, the model only considers the effects of a belief\nchange to certainty. But it is plausible that one\u2019s preference\n\u2013 say, for a vacation in Florida \u2013 changes just because\none believes that it is more likely that there will be a hurricane\nnext week. Jeffrey\u2019s model can be generalised by introducing a\nmore general probability updating rule (e.g., Jeffrey\nconditionalisation). An alternative solution was proposed by Bradley\n(2005). It is based on relatively strong assumptions on the relation\nbetween prior and posterior unconditional preferences.\n\nAn important discussion from economics needs mentioning, namely the\nquestion whether models of doxastic preference change are capable in\nprinciple to represent all preference changes. This question\noriginates with an important paper by Stigler and Becker (1977), who\nargued that a wide range of phenomena which are commonly thought of as\npreference changes\u2014like addiction, habitual behaviour, fashions\nand the effects of marketing\u2014can be explained by stable,\nwell-behaved preferences. In a rather informal fashion, they argue\nthat such explanations involve only changes in information (more\nprecisely: prices and income), while leaving preferences intact. As a\nresult of this, economists largely abandoned the discussion of\npreference change, believing that all preference change phenomena can\nbe explained in this way. Prima facie, their proposed explanations\nexhibit important similarities to the discussed accounts of doxastic\npreference change. The results from that discussion, which show that\nmodels of doxastic preference change are subject to relatively strong\nconstraints, may therefore put doubt on the orthodox position in\neconomics that models of doxastic preference change are capable in\nprinciple to represent all preference changes.\n7.4 Valuational preference change\n\nIf an agent forms a specific preference as a result of some\nexperience, further changes in her overall preference state are often\nnecessary to regain consistency. A model of preference change can\ntherefore be constructed as an input-output model in the same style as\nstandard models of belief change. (Hansson 1995, Liu 2011) Changes in\npreference are triggered by inputs that are represented by sentences\nexpressing new preference patterns. Hence, if the subject grows tired\nof her previous favourite brand of mustard, \\(A\\), and starts to like\nbrand \\(C\\) better, then this will be represented by a change with the\nsentence \u201c\\(C\\) is better than \\(A\\)\u201d, in formal language\n\\(C\\succ A\\), as an input. However, a change in which the previous\npreference \\(A\\succ C\\) is replaced by the new preference \\(C\\succ A\\)\ncan take place in different ways. For instance, there may be a third\nbrand \\(B\\) that was previously placed between \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) in the\npreference ordering.  The instruction to make the new preference\nrelation satisfy \\(C\\succ A\\) does not tell us where \\(B\\) should be\nplaced in the new ordering. The new ordering may for instance be\neither \\(C\\succ A\\succ B\\) or \\(C\\succ B\\succ A\\). One way to deal\nwith this is to include additional information in the input, for\ninstance specifying which element(s) of the alternative set should be\nmoved while the others keep their previous positions. In our example,\nif only \\(C\\) is going to be moved, then the outcome should satisfy\n\\(C\\succ A\\succ B\\). These and other considerations make it necessary\nto modify the standard model of belief change in order to accommodate\nthe subject matter of preferences.\n8. Preference criticism\n\nIn scholarly discussions, preferences are usually taken to be open to\nrational criticism only insofar as (i) they have been inconsistent,\nviolating some of the rationally justifiable preference axioms, or\n(ii) they (in combination with beliefs) commit the agent to\ninconsistent inferences. \n\nCan there be rationally justifiable claims that certain\nintrinsic preferences \u2013 i.e. preferences that are not\ndependent on other preferences \u2013 are wrong, or should be\nchanged? The Humean position answers no. Hume distinguished reason\nfrom the passion, and argued \u201cthat reason alone can never be a\nmotive to any action of the will; that it can never oppose passion in\nthe direction of the will\u201d (Treatise, Book II, Part\nIII, Section III). Humeans often took this distinction between beliefs\nand desires to imply not only that beliefs alone cannot motivate\naction, but also that desires are not open to similar rational\ncriticism as beliefs. Therefore, Humeans conclude, preferences can\nonly be criticised if they are extrinsic \u2013 i.e.\ninstrumentally derived from other preferences on the basis of beliefs\n\u2013 or inconsistent. Such criticism of extrinsic preferences would\nseem ultimately to be a criticism of false beliefs, and it could be\nargued that it is therefore not really criticism of preferences\n(Broome 1993). \n\nSeveral authors have argued for a more substantial criticism of\npreferences, including that of intrinsic ones. Some critics argue that\nsome or all preferences are in fact a kind of belief, and hence open\nto the same rational criticism as beliefs. Two defences have been\npresented to counter this challenge. First, it has been claimed that\nthat desires (standing for motivation in general) are fundamentally\ndistinct from epistemic states in their direction of fit.\nBeliefs are directed to fit the world; hence their insufficient fit\nprovides the basis for their criticism. Desires are directed to fit\nthe world to them; hence they lack this basis for criticism (Smith\n1987). Second, Humeans have argued that treating desires as beliefs is\nincompatible with Bayesian decision theory and also with other,\nnon-quantitative, decision theories (Lewis 1988, Collins 1991,\nByrne/Hajek 1997). \n\nSome proponents of the criticizability of preferences have referred to\nsecond-order preferences. An addict may prefer not to prefer smoking;\na malevolent person may prefer not to prefer evil actions; an indolent\nmay prefer not to prefer to shun work; a daydreamer may prefer not to\nprefer what cannot be realised, etc. First-order preferences are\ncriticisable if they do not comply with second-order preferences. (For\naccounts of second-order preferences, see Frankfurt 1971, Sen 1977.)\nSecond-order preferences may trigger attempts to change one\u2019s\npreferences. Methods of self-restraint, self-command and\nself-improvement have been extensively described (Schelling 1984,\nElster 1989, 2000). Already Hume described the possibility of\nrationally choosing such expedience (Gr\u00fcne-Yanoff & McClennen\n2006). \n\nCritics have argued against the possibility of rationally choosing\nsuch indirect preference-modifying strategies. Millgram (1998) argues\nthat knowledge of the way such desires-at-will were brought about\nmakes it impossible for them to actually function as the desires they\nare intended to be. He gives the example of a car salesman, who, in\norder to be successful in his work, makes himself prefer the various\nuseless knick-knacks that the brand he represents offers for its cars.\nWhen the salesman is laid off, the car-dealer offers him a car with\nall the useless extras that he made himself prefer. Because he\nremembers how he acquired these preferences, he chooses not to act on\nthem. So, Millgram argues, the desire-at-will was not genuine. What is\nmissing, he points out, are the backward-directed inferential\ncommitments that genuine preferences bring with them. Only if one\nforgets that one acquired a specific preference at will, or if one\nalso acquires the inferential commitments of such a preference, can\npreferring-at-will be successful. \n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Abbas, Moncef, 1995. \u201cAny Complete Preference Structure\nWithout Circuits Admits an Interval Representation\u201d, <em>Theory\nand Decision</em>, 39: 115\u2013126.", "Ainslie, George, 1992, <em>Picoeconomics: The Strategic\nInteraction of Successive Motivational States Within the Person</em>,\nCambridge: Cambridge University Press.", "Anand, Paul, 1993, \u201cThe Philosophy of Intransitive\nPreference\u201d, <em>Economic Journal</em>, 103: 337\u2013346.", "Arneson, Richard J., 1989, \u201cEquality and Equal Opportunity\nfor Welfare\u201d, <em>Philosophical Studies</em>, 56:\n77\u201393.", "Arrow, Kenneth J., 1963, <em>Social Choice and Individual\nValues</em>, New Haven and London: Yale University Press, first\nedition 1951.", "Armstrong, Wallace E., 1939, \u201cThe Determinateness of the\nUtility Function\u201d, <em>Economic Journal</em>, 49:\n453\u2013467.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1948, \u201cUncertainty and the Utility\nFunction\u201d, <em>Economic Journal</em>, 58: 1\u201310.", "Aumann, Robert J., 1962, \u201cUtility Theory Without the\nCompleteness Axiom\u201d, <em>Econometrica</em>, 30(3):\n445\u2013462.", "Becker, Gary S. and Michael, Robert T., 1973, \u201cOn the New\nTheory of Consumer Behavior\u201d, <em>The Economic Approach to Human\nBehavior</em>, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1976,\npp. 131\u2013149.", "Binmore, K., 2008, <em>Rational Decisions</em>, Princeton:\nPrinceton University Press.", "B\u00f6ckenholt, Ulf, 2002, \u201cA Thurstonian Analysis of\nPreference Change\u201d, <em>Journal of Mathematical Psychology</em>,\n46: 300\u2013314.", "Bradley, Richard, 2005, \u201cRadical Probabilism and Mental\nKinematics\u201d, <em>Philosophy of Science</em>, 72:\n342\u2013364.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1999, \u201cConditional\nDesirability\u201d, <em>Theory and Decision</em>, 47(1):\n23\u201355.", "Brandt, Richard B., 1979, <em>A Theory of the Good and the\nRight</em>, Oxford: Oxford University Press.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1998, \u201cThe Rational Criticism of\nPreferences\u201d, in <em>Preferences</em>, C.
