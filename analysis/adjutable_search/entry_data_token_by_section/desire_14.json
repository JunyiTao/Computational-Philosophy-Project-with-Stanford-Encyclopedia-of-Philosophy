    "main_text": "Controversies Surrounding Desire || Preferences and Desires\n3.3 Preferences and Desires\n\n\nTalk of preference, rather than desire, tends to dominate the\nliterature of decision theory. The decision theorist sees human beings\nas making choices between options, and these choices express\npreferences among the options. If the human being is rational, her\npreferences are consistent and allow one to determine the expected\nutility of any given choice for her. The expected utility of an action,\nin turn, is the pleasure (or relief from suffering) it can be expected\nto bring, according to one (mostly older) approach, or is the degree to\nwhich the agent would (ideally) be inclined to choose it, according to\nthe other (more modern) approach to utility (see, e.g., Skyrms 1990 for\na discussion).\n\n\nIf utility is treated as pleasure, then decision theory is\ncompatible with any theory of desire that holds pleasure to be the only\nthing desired. If utility is treated as choice-worthiness, then\ndecision theory is compatible with any theory of desire at all (except\nperhaps for theories that hold desires are beliefs in goodness, as\ndiscussed in section 1.3). So the focus on preferences does not, on its\nown, generate conflict between decision theory and theories of\ndesire.\n\n\nConflict can arise, however, when one asks whether desires or\npreferences are more fundamental; John Pollock has recently brought\nattention to this dispute (Pollock 2006). Decision theorists have\ntended to treat pairwise preferences as basic: the basic attitude is\nthat of preferring A to B (e.g., von Neumann and Morgenstern 1944).\nMost other theorists of desire have treated desires as basic: the basic\nattitude is that of desiring A. If desires are basic, and desires have\nstrengths, then it is easy enough to determine preferences from them:\nif I desire that my father be healthy to a high degree, and I desire\nthat I do my laundry to a low degree, then it follows that I prefer my\nfather's health to doing the laundry, all else being equal. But\nif preferences are basic, then deriving something like desires from\nthem becomes an interesting task (discussed briefly above, in Section\n2.3).\n\n\nThe simplest reason to suppose that preferences are basic is that they\nare readily introspected and acted upon, whereas desires with specific\nstrengths are not. I can tell that I prefer securing my father's\nhealth to doing the laundry, and I know which I would choose if it\ncame to a choice. But can I introspect the degree to which I prefer my\nfather's health over clean laundry? Perhaps not. And if I cannot,\nperhaps this is because I have introspective access to the most basic\npsychological facts only, and these are facts about simple pairwise\npreferences. As von Neumann and Morgenstern write, \u201cevery\nmeasurement\u2014or rather every claim of measurability\u2014must\nultimately be based on some immediate sensation, which possibly cannot\nand certainly need not be analyzed any further. In the case of utility\nthe immediate sensation of preference\u2014of one object or aggregate\nof objects as against another\u2014provides this basis\u201d (1944,\n16).\n\n\nOne reason to suppose that preferences are not basic is that it\nappears, within standard decision theory, that a very large number of\nbasic pairwise preferences are required in order to settle facts about\nhow much one prefers A to B for arbitrary objects A and B. That is, the\nfacts about degrees of desire can only be generated from more basic\nfacts about pairwise preferences given a truly enormous number of basic\nfacts about pairwise preferences. Pollock (2006) argues that the number\nof such facts is on the order of a billion billions at the very least,\njust to encode the same facts about desire and preference that could\nreadily be generated from just three hundred basic facts about desires.\nFrom the assumption that the basic psychological facts must be\nphysically realized in the brain, Pollock concludes that it is\npsychologically realistic to believe in basic desires, not basic\npairwise preferences.\n\n\nComplicating matters is empirical research suggesting that our\npreferences are subject to such powerful contextual influences that it\nis better to talk about the construction of coherent preferences than\nabout their derivation from underlying desires (see, e.g., the papers\nin Lichtenstein and Slovic 2006). For example, in a classic study, it\nwas found that offering subjects a free choice between one of two bets\n(of almost identical expected value\u2014around $4\u2014but with\ndifferent maximum payoffs and different maximum penalties) led to\nsubjects revealing a preference for one of the two bets. Offering the\nsame subjects a chance to bid on each bet revealed that subjects were\noften willing to pay more to play the other of the two bets, apparently\nshowing that subjects preferred the other of the two bets when bidding\nbut not when choosing freely (Lichtenstein and Slovic 1971). Thus,\nsomething as minimal as the difference between choosing and bidding can\nshift preferences between two near-equivalent bets, or so it would\nseem, calling into question the very existence of a stable fact about\npreference independent of the way a choice is framed. If this is the\nbest way to look at things, then perhaps it will turn out that a small\nnumber of preferences are basic, and that there just are no facts about\nthe degree to which something is desired overall by a person.\n",
