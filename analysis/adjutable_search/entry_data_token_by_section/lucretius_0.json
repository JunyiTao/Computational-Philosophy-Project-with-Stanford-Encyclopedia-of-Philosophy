    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\nWe know little about Lucretius\u2019 life beyond what we can infer\nfrom his work. Our sole external reference comes from Cicero, in a\nletter to his brother Quintus serving with Caesar in Gaul, dated from\nFebruary 54 BCE (Q.F. 2.10.3). Cicero agrees with his\nbrother\u2019s praise of the work, noting that it displays both\nbrilliance and originality, but also considerable craftsmanship.\nAlthough Cicero and his brother may have read an earlier or partial\ndraft, such a date for the poem we have is compatible with two main\ninternal indicators.\n\nFirst is the poem\u2019s addressee, the Roman aristocrat, Memmius,\nnamed only in books 1, 2 and 5. While doubts are possible as to which\nmember of the Memmii Lucretius so honoured, most likely he is C.\nMemmius, the praetor of 58 BCE, governor of Bithynia in 57, where the\npoets Catullus and Cinna served on his staff, and who was exiled in 52\nBCE as the result of an electoral scandal. The story, attested in\nother letters of Cicero, that Memmius had plans to build on the site\nof Epicurus\u2019 house (in Melite, not the Garden itself), has\nsometimes been taken as spite from a failed attempt at conversion, but\nit makes more sense as an offer of patronage by an Epicurean-Roman\ngrandee that fell afoul of local sensitivities (Morgan and Taylor\n2017). The friendship with Memmius to which Lucretius aspires\n(DRN 1.141) need not imply equal status for Lucretius but is\nalso compatible with a patronage relation. The second indicator is\nLucretius\u2019 mention at DRN 1.41 of the current age as\n\u2018this troubled time for our country\u2019. The standard view,\nthat this relates to the early 50s was challenged by Hutchinson\n(2001), who argued for 49\u201348 BCE, but for a rejoinder see Volk\n(2010). Krebs (2013), in support of the earlier date, shows some\npossible Lucretian influence on Caesar\u2019s vocabulary in his\nCommentaries on the Gallic War.\n\nLater biographical material contains a few plausible elements but is\notherwise unreliable. Donatus\u2019 life of Vergil claims that\nLucretius died on 15th October 53 BCE, the same day Vergil reached\nmanhood (donned his toga virilis). The date is possible, but\nthe coincidence is obviously a passing of the poetic torch. Jerome\ngives his birth as 94 BCE and his death at age 44 or 39 (uncertain\ntext; 39 best matches other evidence), but then relates a bizarre\nstory that Lucretius was driven mad by a love potion and composed the\nDRN during the \u2018intervals of sanity\u2019 before he\ncommitted suicide. Thereafter Cicero edited or prepared the poem for\npublication. That the love philtre was administered by his wife is not\nin Jerome but turns up in medieval sources. Much of this is hard to\ntake at face value (Holford-Strevens 2002). Cicero\u2019s involvement\nin the initial diffusion, as opposed to editing of the DRN,\nis just possible, but he never mentions it in his later philosophical\nworks. Otherwise, Jerome\u2019s tale of madness does not square with\nthe earliest reception of the DRN, the high esteem shown\nLucretius in Vergil, Horace, Ovid and beyond.\n\nTo consider only the first of these, his influence on his younger\ncontemporary Vergil (70\u201319 BCE) was central. Vergil\u2019s\nadmiration is made quasi explicit in the poetic blessing at\nGeorgics 2.490\u201392: \u2018Happy he who was able to know\nthe causes of things and crushed underfoot all fear, inexorable fate,\nand the harsh roar of greedy hell\u2019. In specifying the basis for\nthis happiness, \u2018knowing the causes of things\u2019, Vergil\nevokes Lucretius\u2019 title (rerum causas suggests\nrerum natura), yet also connects this universal knowledge to\nits practical aim: the banishment of fears of all kinds, including\nliberation from fatalism (the swerve) and the fear of death and the\nafterlife (Book 3). Peace of mind in the here and now, Greek\nataraxia, achieved through the study of Epicurean, atomic\nphysics, was the formal, therapeutic goal of Epicureanism.\nVergil\u2019s evocation thus knowingly sums up some of the\nDRN\u2019s key themes, and flatteringly conflates\nLucretius\u2019 poetic accomplishments with the wisdom of Epicurus\nhimself \u2014flatteringly because in doctrinal matters Lucretius\nonly depicts himself as following his master. More importantly, the\nbeatitude Vergil attributes to him is hardly compatible with, and more\nthan enough to dispel, Jerome\u2019s suicidal madman.\n\nLucretius\u2019 insanity and miserable end in Jerome seem rather\nmotivated by early Christian hostility to the Epicurean denial of\nprovidence (Lactantius, sometimes using Lucretius as a source for\nEpicureanism, calls him \u2018mad\u2019), perhaps overlaid upon some\nnow-lost poetic-fictional retribution for Lucretius\u2019 attack on\nerotic love in the concluding sections of book 4, although that is\nonly a guess. But even if our sole biographical source is not\ncredible, its chronology remains compatible with our other\ninformation, that is, a life span ranging from the mid-90s to mid-50s\nBCE. Perhaps one last nugget of plausibility among the biographical\ndross is that a premature death, as opposed to suicide, does seem\nconsistent with the unfinished status of the DRN.\n",
