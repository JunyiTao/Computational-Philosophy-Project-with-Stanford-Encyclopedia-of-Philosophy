Contemporary approaches to\nphilosophical historiography have sometimes assumed that\ncontextualization is unnecessary, but this assumption, left\nunchallenged, can constrain critical analysis. When traditional\nhistorians of philosophy have begun to engage with questions of race,\nthe problematics have sometimes been foreshortened by decontextualized\nmethods of analysis. In this vein, Robert Bernasconi argues that\nnaturalistic tendencies in analytic philosophy have overemphasized the\nquestion of whether a given philosopher believed in race as a natural\nkind, resulting in a limited interpretive exploration (2012,\n552\u2013553).\n\nTake, for example, Du Bois\u2019s rich 1899 [1986a] text \u201cThe\nConservation of Races\u201d where he elaborates an account of African\nAmericans as a distinct historical people. Du Bois\u2019s account was\nreduced in a number of contemporary critical essays to the question of\nwhether he meant \u201cblack\u201d to refer to biology, in which\nbiological concepts themselves were understood as free of culture. But\nfrom phenomenology\u2019s point of view, the philosophical\nconceptualization of nature, and the current political uses made of\nnaturalist claims, are themselves cultural artifacts, historically and\nculturally contingent. Thus, when we read the history of modern\nEuropean philosophy, we need to be alive to the ways in which\n\u201cnature\u201d is being socially constructed and conscripted for\nphilosophical projects.\n\nCPR has worked to advance new interpretations of canonical\nphilosophers but has also, at the meta-level, contested standard\napproaches to interpretation. The interpretation of Kant, for example,\nhas had to contend with his extensive writings on anthropology and\ngeography in which he espoused unambiguously racist claims (Elden and\nMendieta 2011; Kant 1798 [2012]). Until recently this large body of writings\nwas considered irrelevant to the understanding of Kant\u2019s ethics\nor his cosmopolitanism on the grounds of disciplinary distinctions\nbetween philosophical work and other writings. But why ignore\nKant\u2019s writings about the nature of human difference if we are\ntrying to understand his actual views about the way peoples should\ninteract? Like feminist philosophers who developed an analysis of the\nsubtle ways in which some moral theories assumed a male embodiment,\nCritical Philosophers of Race have shown that doctrines of\nself-determination and universal reciprocity developed by modern\nEuropean philosophers were never intended to apply to all groups: the\nright to autonomy was based on certain capacities that legitimated the\nexclusion of children, the disabled, and usually women, but, also,\nnon-Europeans who were viewed as developmentally \u201cbehind\u201d.\nTaking some aspect of a philosophers\u2019 view and giving it the most\ngenerous reading possible distorts our understanding of modern\nphilosophy and its conceptual offerings (Basevich 2020;\nShorter-Bourhanou forthcoming; Kirkland 2018).\n\nMills argues that the only way to make sense of the evident\ncontradictions in modern European philosophy is to understand this body\nof work as distinguishing types of selves among the human race\n(Mills 1998). Because of these type-differences, anti-authoritarian\nreforms and demands for democracy were never meant to be extended to\nthe colonies. Sub-persons (women, slaves, the members of inferior\ncultures) did not merit suffrage, freedom, consultation, or\nself-determination. There was debate over whether these groups would\nremain forever inferior, less than human, or whether they might advance\n(Boxill 2005). But even those, like Rousseau, who believed in the\npossibility of uplift, assumed that \u201cpersons\u201d would be the\nones showing \u201csub-persons\u201d the way forward, and judging\ntheir progress.\n",
