    "main_text": "Thought || The Interpenetration of the Six Elements: The Embodiment of Emptiness as an Empty Body\n3.5 The Interpenetration of the Six Elements: The Embodiment of Emptiness as an Empty Body\n\nK\u016bkai (e.g. in his Sokushinj\u014dbutsugi, ch.3)\ndiscusses Dainichi as a \u201cbody of the six great elements\u201d\n(rokudaishin, rokudai-taidai), which are the five\nuniversal material elements (godai) of earth, water, fire,\nwind/air, and space, representing the \u201cknown,\u201d plus the\nuniversal mental element (shindai) of consciousness,\nrepresenting the \u201cknower.\u201d Ultimately the five material\nelements make up the body of Dainichi and the sixth element designates\nthe mind of Dainichi. Their dynamic but harmonious interplay\nconstitute the \u201ctimeless yoga\u201d or samadhi (Jpn:\nj\u014d) of Dainichi\u2019s body-and-mind. But since\nDainichi is equated with the cosmos, all things comprising the whole\nworld are generated and perish through the interplay \u2013\n\u201cnon-obstruction\u201d and \u201cinterfusion\u201d \u2013 of\nthese elemental constituents. K\u016bkai then is definitely not an\nidealist taken in its western philosophical significance, and\nShingon thought in this aspect is distinct from the teachings of the\n\u201cmind-only\u201d (Yuishiki; Skrt:\nVij\u00f1apti-m\u0101trat\u0101) school of Buddhism. For\nthe mental and the material, for K\u016bkai, are two non-dualistic\n(interpenetrating and mutually non-obstructing) aspects of the same\nDharma \u2013 as depicted in the two mandalic embodiments, which we\nshall discuss below. In other words K\u016bkai does not reduce reality\nto either mind or matter; his perspective is neither merely idealist\nnor merely materialist.\n\nThe interrelationship amongst the elements signifies their\nnon-substantiality, i.e. the fact that they are not ontologically\nindependent, and in Buddhist parlance this means\n\u201cemptiness\u201d (\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101,\nk\u016b). Hence all elements and things they constitute,\nincluding the entire cosmos is empty. Dainichi\u2019s body, as the\nhosshin that embodies the Dharma, is an embodiment of\nemptiness, analogically understood as a vast empty space \u2013 it is\nin part analogical but also exemplary of emptiness. Rather than\nobstructing the emergence of things, this emptiness permits it through\ntheir interdependent origination, which is the meaning of emptiness.\nTheir materiality is then just as real as their emptiness, and\nemptiness and matter are non-dualistic. True to the \u201cmiddle\nway\u201d of Buddhism, K\u016bkai treads a path that avoids reifying\nsubstantialism on the one hand as well as utter nihilism on the other\nhand. And in the non-dualistic interrelationships between body and\nmind, matter and emptiness, known and knower, the Dharma itself, as\nthe truth of non-duality in interdependent origination qua\nemptiness is revealed in every physical and mental process of the\ncosmos as the embodiment of the Dharma.\n\nThe \u201chorizontal\u201d interpenetration between the elements,\ni.e., the interdependence and mutual non-obstruction amongst the\nimmanent phenomena of the cosmos, also translates into the\n\u201cvertical\u201d interpenetration between the whole and its\nparts, that is, between Dainichi as embodied in the cosmos and all\nthing-events within. The implications of such cosmic non-duality for\nthe practitioner is immensely significant. In non-duality with the\ncosmic Buddha, one\u2019s unenlightened self in both\nmind-and-body is thus an expression of the hosshin, an\nembodiment of the Dharma. That is, as one\u2019s mental states\nexpress the samadhi of Dainichi, so also one\u2019s body\nalong with the bodies of all living and non-living things, in every\nbodily movement, manifests Dainichi\u2019s body and its movements.\nDainichi is preaching the Dharma through all phenomena of the cosmos.\nBut as we ourselves are the bodies through which Dainichi preaches, we\nare enabled to realize the cosmic samadhi that our\nbodies-and-minds express. This points to the non-dualistic\nsignificance between the two exemplary concepts of Shingon Buddhism:\nhosshin sepp\u014d and sokushinj\u014dbutsu, both of\nwhich we shall examine in detail in the following sections.\n",
