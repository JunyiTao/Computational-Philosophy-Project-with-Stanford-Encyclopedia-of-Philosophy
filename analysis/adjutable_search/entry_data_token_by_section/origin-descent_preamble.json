    "main_text": "\n\nThis entry intends to give a broad historical review of the origin and\ndevelopment of Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution by natural selection\nthrough the initial Darwinian phase of the \u201cDarwinian\nRevolution\u201d up to the publication of the Descent of Man\nin 1871. The development of evolutionary ideas before Darwin\u2019s\nwork has been treated in the separate entry\n evolutionary thought before Darwin.\n Several additional aspects of Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution and\nhis biographical development are dealt with in other entries in this\nencyclopedia (see the entries on\n Darwinism;\n species;\n natural selection;\n creationism). The remainder of this entry will focus on the following\npoints in relation to Darwin\u2019s theory not developed in the other\nentries. It will also maintain a historical and textual approach.\nOther entries in this encyclopedia cited at the end of the article and\nthe bibliography should be consulted for discussions beyond this\npoint. The issues will be examined under the following headings:\n",
