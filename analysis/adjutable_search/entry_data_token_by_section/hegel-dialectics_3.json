Some of their skepticism grows out of the role that\ncontradiction plays in his thought and argument. While many of the\noppositions embedded in the dialectical development and the\ndefinitions of concepts or forms are not contradictions in the strict\nsense, as we saw\n (section 2,\n above), scholars such as Graham Priest have suggested that some of\nthem arguably are (Priest 1989: 391). Hegel even holds, against Kant\n(cf.\n section 3\n above), that there are contradictions, not only in thought, but also\nin the world. Motion, for instance, Hegel says, is an\n\u201cexistent contradiction\u201d. As he describes it:\n\n\nSomething moves, not because now it is here and there at another now,\nbut because in one and the same now it is here and not here, because\nin this here, it is and is not at the same time. (SL-dG 382; cf. SL-M\n440) \n\n\nKant\u2019s sorts of antinomies (cf.\n section 3\n above) or contradictions more generally are therefore, as Hegel puts\nit in one place, \u201cin all objects of all kinds, in\nall representations, concepts and ideas\u201d (EL-GSH Remark\nto \u00a748). Hegel thus seems to reject, as he himself explicitly\nclaims (SL-M 439\u201340; SL-dG 381\u201382), the law of\nnon-contradiction, which is a fundamental principle of formal\nlogic\u2014the classical, Aristotelian logic (see entries on\n Aristotle\u2019s Logic\n and\n Contradiction)\n that dominated during Hegel\u2019s lifetime as well as the dominant\nsystems of symbolic logic today (cf. Priest 1989: 391; D\u00fcsing\n2010: 97\u2013103). According to the law of non-contradiction,\nsomething cannot be both true and false at the same time or, put\nanother way, \u201cx\u201d and \u201cnot-x\u201d cannot both be\ntrue at the same time.\n\nHegel\u2019s apparent rejection of the law of non-contradiction has\nled some interpreters to regard his dialectics as illogical, even\n\u201cabsurd\u201d (Popper 1940: 420; 1962: 330; 2002: 443). Karl R.\nPopper, for instance, argued that accepting Hegel\u2019s and other\ndialecticians\u2019 rejection of the law of non-contradiction as part\nof both a logical theory and a general theory of the world\n\u201cwould mean a complete breakdown of science\u201d (Popper 1940:\n408; 1962: 317; 2002: 426). Since, according to today\u2019s systems\nof symbolic logic, he suggested, the truth of a contradiction leads\nlogically to any claim (any claim can logically be inferred from two\ncontradictory claims), if we allow contradictory claims to be valid or\ntrue together, then we would have no reason to rule out any claim\nwhatsoever (Popper 1940: 408\u2013410; 1962: 317\u2013319; 2002:\n426\u2013429).\n\nPopper was notoriously hostile toward Hegel\u2019s work (cf. Popper\n2013: 242\u2013289; for a scathing criticism of Popper\u2019s\nanalysis see Kaufmann 1976 [1972]), but, as Priest has noted (Priest\n1989: 389\u201391), even some sympathetic interpreters have been\ninspired by today\u2019s dominant systems of symbolic logic to hold\nthat the kind of contradiction that is embedded in Hegel\u2019s\ndialectics cannot be genuine contradiction in the strict sense. While\nDieter Wandschneider, for instance, grants that his sympathetic theory\nof dialectic \u201cis not presented as a faithful interpretation of\nthe Hegelian text\u201d (Wandschneider 2010: 32), he uses the same\nlogical argument that Popper offered in defense of the claim that\n\u201cdialectical contradiction is not a \u2018normal\u2019\ncontradiction, but one that is actually only an apparent\ncontradiction\u201d (Wandschneider 2010: 37). The suggestion (by the\ntraditional, triadic account of Hegel\u2019s dialectics, cf.\n section 2,\n above) that Being and Nothing (or non-being) is a contradiction, for\ninstance, he says, rests on an ambiguity. Being is an undefined\ncontent, taken to mean being or presence, while Nothing is an\nundefined content, taken to mean nothing or absence\n (section 2,\n above; cf. Wandschneider 2010: 34\u201335). Being is Nothing\n(or non-being) with respect to the property they have as\nconcepts, namely, that they both have an undefined content. But Being\nis not Nothing (or non-being) with respect to their\nmeaning (Wandschneider 2010: 34\u201338). The supposed\ncontradiction between them, then, Wandschneider suggests, takes place\n\u201cin different respects\u201d. It is therefore only an\napparent contradiction. \u201cRightly understood\u201d, he\nconcludes, \u201cthere can be no talk of contradiction\u201d\n(Wandschneider 2010: 38).\n\nInoue Kazumi also argues that dialectical contradiction in the\nHegelian sense does not violate the law of non-contradiction (Inoue\n2014: 121\u2013123), and he rejects Popper\u2019s claim that\nHegel\u2019s dialectical method is incompatible with good science. A\ndialectical contradiction, Inoue says, is a contradiction that arises\nwhen the same topic is considered from different vantage points, but\neach vantage point by itself does not violate the law of\nnon-contradiction (Inoue 2014: 120). The understanding leads to\ncontradictions, as Hegel said (cf.\n section 3\n above), because it examines a topic from a fixed point of view;\nreason embraces contradictions because it examines a topic from\nmultiple points of view (Inoue 2014: 121). The geocentric theory that\nthe sun revolves around the Earth and the heliocentric theory that the\nEarth revolves around the sun, for instance, Inoue suggests, are both\ncorrect from certain points of view. We live our everyday lives from a\nvantage point in which the sun makes a periodic rotation around the\nEarth roughly every 24 hours. Astronomers make their observations from\na geocentric point of view and then translate those observations into\na heliocentric one. From these points of view, the geocentric account\nis not incorrect. But physics, particularly in its concepts of mass\nand force, requires the heliocentric account. For science\u2014which\ntakes all these points of view into consideration\u2014both theories\nare valid: they are dialectically contradictory, though neither\ntheory, by itself, violates the law of non-contradiction (Inoue 2014:\n126\u2013127). To insist that the Earth really revolves around\nthe sun is merely an irrational, reductive prejudice, theoretically\nand practically (Inoue 2014: 126). Dialectical contradictions, Inoue\nsays, are, as Hegel said, constructive: they lead to concepts or\npoints of view that grasp the world from ever wider and more\nencompassing perspectives, culminating ultimately in the\n\u201cAbsolute\u201d (Inoue 2014: 121; cf.\n section 1,\n above). Hegel\u2019s claim that motion violates the law of\nnon-contradiction, Inoue suggests, is an expression of the idea that\ncontradictory claims can be true when motion is described from more\nthan one point of view (Inoue 2014: 123). (For a similar reading of\nHegel\u2019s conception of dialectical contradiction, which\ninfluenced Inoue\u2019s account [Inoue 2014: 121], see D\u00fcsing\n2010: 102\u2013103.)\n\nOther interpreters, however, have been inspired by Hegel\u2019s\ndialectics to develop alternative systems of logic that do not\nsubscribe to the law of non-contradiction. Priest, for instance, has\ndefended Hegel\u2019s rejection of the law of non-contradiction (cf.\nPriest 1989; 1997 [2006: 4]). The acceptance of some\ncontradictions, he has suggested, does not require the acceptance of\nall contradictions (Priest 1989: 392). Popper\u2019s logical\nargument is also unconvincing. Contradictions lead logically to any\nclaim whatsoever, as Popper said, only if we presuppose that\nnothing can be both true and false at the same time (i.e. only if we\npresuppose that the law of non-contradiction is correct), which is\njust what Hegel denies. Popper\u2019s logical argument thus assumes\nwhat it is supposed to prove or begs the question (Priest 1989: 392;\n1997 [2006: 5\u20136]), and so is not convincing. Moreover,\nconsistency (not allowing contradictions), Priest suggests, is\nactually \u201ca very weak constraint\u201d (Priest 1997 [2006:\n104]) on what counts as a rational inference. Other principles or\ncriteria\u2014such as being strongly disproved (or supported) by the\ndata\u2014are more important for determining whether a claim or\ninference is rational (Priest 1997 [2006: 105]). And, as Hegel pointed\nout, Priest says, the data\u2014namely, \u201cthe world as it\nappears\u201d (as Hegel puts it in EL) or \u201cordinary\nexperience itself\u201d (as Hegel puts it in SL)\u2014suggest that\nthere are indeed contradictions (EL Remark to \u00a748; SL-dG 382; cf.\nSL-M 440; Priest 1989: 389, 399\u2013400). Hegel is right, for\ninstance, Priest argues, that change, and motion in particular, are\nexamples of real or existing contradictions (Priest 1985; 1989:\n396\u201397; 1997 [2006: 172\u2013181, 213\u201315]). What\ndistinguishes motion, as a process, from a situation in which\nsomething is simply here at one time and then some other place at some\nother time is the embodiment of contradiction: that, in a process of\nmotion, there is one (span of) time in which something is both here\nand not here at the same time (in that span of time) (Priest 1985:\n340\u2013341; 1997 [2006: 172\u2013175, 213\u2013214]). A system of\nlogic, Priest suggests, is always just a theory about what good\nreasoning should be like (Priest 1989: 392). A dialectical logic that\nadmits that there are \u201cdialetheia\u201d or true contradictions\n(Priest 1989: 388), he says, is a broader theory or version of logic\nthan traditional, formal logics that subscribe to the law of\nnon-contradiction. Those traditional logics apply only to topics or\ndomains that are consistent, primarily domains that are \u201cstatic\nand changeless\u201d (Priest 1989: 391; cf. 395);\ndialectical/dialetheic logic handles consistent domains, but also\napplies to domains in which there are dialetheia. Thus Priest,\nextending Hegel\u2019s own concept of aufheben (\u201cto\nsublate\u201d; cf.\n section 1,\n above), suggests that traditional \u201cformal logic is perfectly\nvalid in its domain, but dialectical (dialetheic) logic is more\ngeneral\u201d (Priest 1989: 395). (For an earlier example of a\nlogical system that allows contradiction and was inspired in part by\nHegel [and Marx], see Ja\u015bkowski 1999: 36 [1969: 143] [cf. Inoue\n2014: 128\u2013129]. For more on dialetheic logic generally, see the\nentry on\n Dialetheism.)\n\nWorries that Hegel\u2019s arguments fail to fit his account of\ndialectics (see\n section 2,\n above) have led some interpreters to conclude that his method is\narbitrary or that his works have no single dialectical method at all\n(Findlay 1962: 93; Solomon 1983: 21). These interpreters reject the\nidea that there is any logical necessity to the moves from\nstage to stage. \u201c[T]he important point to make here, and again\nand again\u201d, Robert C. Solomon writes, for instance, \n\n\nis that the transition from the first form to the second, or the\ntransition from the first form of the Phenomenology all the\nway to the last, is not in any way a deductive necessity. The\nconnections are anything but entailments, and the\nPhenomenology could always take another route and\nother starting points. (Solomon 1983: 230) \n\n\nIn a footnote to this passage, Solomon adds \u201cthat a\nformalization of Hegel\u2019s logic, however ingenious, is\nimpossible\u201d (Solomon 1983: 230).\n\nSome scholars have argued that Hegel\u2019s necessity is not intended\nto be logical necessity. Walter Kaufmann suggested, for instance, that\nthe necessity at work in Hegel\u2019s dialectic is a kind of organic\nnecessity. The moves in the Phenomenology, he said, follow\none another \u201cin the way in which, to use a Hegelian image from\nthe preface, bud, blossom and fruit succeed each other\u201d\n(Kaufmann 1965: 148; 1966: 132). Findlay argued that later stages\nprovide what he called a \u201chigher-order comment\u201d\non earlier stages, even if later stages do not follow from earlier\nones in a trivial way (Findlay 1966: 367). Solomon suggested that the\nnecessity that Hegel wants is not \u201c\u2018necessity\u2019 in\nthe modern sense of \u2018logical necessity,\u2019\u201d (Solomon\n1983: 209), but a kind of progression (Solomon 1983: 207), or a\n\u201cnecessity within a context for some purpose\u201d\n(Solomon 1983: 209). John Burbidge defines Hegel\u2019s necessity in\nterms of three senses of the relationship between actuality and\npossibility, only the last of which is logical necessity (Burbidge\n1981: 195\u20136).\n\nOther scholars have defined the necessity of Hegel\u2019s dialectics\nin terms of a transcendental argument. A transcendental argument\nbegins with uncontroversial facts of experience and tries to show that\nother conditions must be present\u2014or are necessary\u2014for\nthose facts to be possible. Jon Stewart argues, for instance, that\n\u201cHegel\u2019s dialectic in the Phenomenology is a\ntranscendental account\u201d in this sense, and thus has the\nnecessity of that form of argument (Stewart 2000: 23; cf. Taylor 1975:\n97, 226\u20137; for a critique of this view, see Pinkard 1988: 7,\n15).\n\nSome scholars have avoided these debates by interpreting Hegel\u2019s\ndialectics in a literary way. In his examination of the\nepistemological theory of the Phenomenology, for instance,\nKenneth R. Westphal offers \u201ca literary model\u201d of\nHegel\u2019s dialectics based on the story of Sophocles\u2019 play\nAntigone (Westphal 2003: 14, 16). Ermanno Bencivenga offers\nan interpretation that combines a narrative approach with a concept of\nnecessity. For him, the necessity of Hegel\u2019s dialectical logic\ncan be captured by the notion of telling a good story\u2014where\n\u201cgood\u201d implies that the story is both creative and correct\nat the same time (Bencivenga 2000: 43\u201365).\n\nDebate over whether Hegel\u2019s dialectical logic is logical may\nalso be fueled in part by discomfort with his particular brand of\nlogic. Unlike today\u2019s symbolic logics, Hegel\u2019s logic is\nnot only syntactic, but also semantic (cf. Berto 2007; Maybee 2009:\nxx\u2013xxv; Margolis 2010: 193\u201394). Hegel\u2019s interest in\nsemantics appears, for instance, in the very first stages of his\nlogic, where the difference between Being and Nothing is\n\u201csomething merely meant\u201d (EL-GSH Remark to\n\u00a787; cf.\n section 2\n above). While some of the moves from stage to stage are driven by\nsyntactic necessity, other moves are driven by the meanings\nof the concepts in play. Indeed, Hegel rejected what he regarded as\nthe overly formalistic logics that dominated the field during his day\n(EL Remark to \u00a7162; SL-M 43\u201344; SL-dG 24). A logic that\ndeals only with the forms of logical arguments and not the meanings of\nthe concepts used in those argument forms will do no better in terms\nof preserving truth than the old joke about computer programs\nsuggests: garbage in, garbage out. In those logics, if we (using\ntoday\u2019s versions of formal, symbolic logic) plug in something\nfor the P or Q (in the proposition \u201cif P\nthen Q\u201d or \u201cP \u2192 Q\u201d, for\ninstance) or for the \u201cF\u201d, \u201cG\u201d,\nor \u201cx\u201d (in the proposition \u201cif F is\nx, then G is x\u201d or \u201cFx\n\u2192 Gx\u201d, for instance) that means something\ntrue, then the syntax of formal logics will preserve that truth. But\nif we plug in something for those terms that is untrue or meaningless\n(garbage in), then the syntax of formal logic will lead to an untrue\nor meaningless conclusion (garbage out). Today\u2019s versions of\nprepositional logic also assume that we know what the meaning of\n\u201cis\u201d is. Against these sorts of logics, Hegel wanted to\ndevelop a logic that not only preserved truth, but also determined how\nto construct truthful claims in the first place. A logic that defines\nconcepts (semantics) as well as their relationships with one another\n(syntax) will show, Hegel thought, how concepts can be combined into\nmeaningful forms. Because interpreters are familiar with modern logics\nfocused on syntax, however, they may regard Hegel\u2019s syntactic\nand semantic logic as not really logical (cf. Maybee 2009:\nxvii\u2013xxv).\n\nIn Hegel\u2019s other works, the moves from stage to stage are often\ndriven, not only by syntax and semantics\u2014that is, by logic\n(given his account of logic)\u2014but also by considerations that\ngrow out of the relevant subject matter. In the\nPhenomenology, for instance, the moves are driven by syntax,\nsemantics, and by phenomenological factors. Sometimes a move\nfrom one stage to the next is driven by a syntactic\nneed\u2014the need to stop an endless, back-and-forth process, for\ninstance, or to take a new path after all the current options have\nbeen exhausted (cf.\n section 5).\n Sometimes, a move is driven by the meaning of a concept,\nsuch as the concept of a \u201cThis\u201d or \u201cThing\u201d.\nAnd sometimes a move is driven by a phenomenological need or\nnecessity\u2014by requirements of consciousness, or by the\nfact that the Phenomenology is about a consciousness\nthat claims to be aware of (or to know) something. The logic of the\nPhenomenology is thus a phenomeno-logic, or a logic\ndriven by logic\u2014syntax and semantics\u2014and by\nphenomenological considerations. Still, interpreters such as Quentin\nLauer have suggested that, for Hegel, \n\n\nphenomeno-logy is a logic of appearing, a logic of implication, like\nany other logic, even though not of the formal entailment with which\nlogicians and mathematicians are familiar. (Lauer 1976: 3) \n\n\nLauer warns us against dismissing the idea that there is any\nimplication or necessity in Hegel\u2019s method at all (Lauer 1976:\n3). (Other scholars who also believe there is a logical necessity to\nthe dialectics of the Phenomenology include Hyppolite 1974:\n78\u20139 and H.S. Harris 1997: xii.)\n\nWe should also be careful not to exaggerate the\n\u201cnecessity\u201d of formal, symbolic logics. Even in these\nlogics, there can often be more than one path from some premises to\nthe same conclusion, logical operators can be dealt with in different\norders, and different sets of operations can be used to reach the same\nconclusions. There is therefore often no strict, necessary\n\u201centailment\u201d from one step to the next, even though the\nconclusion might be entailed by the whole series of steps, taken\ntogether. As in today\u2019s logics, then, whether Hegel\u2019s\ndialectics counts as logical depends on the degree to which he shows\nthat we are forced\u2014necessarily\u2014from earlier stages or\nseries of stages to later stages (see also\n section 5).\n",
