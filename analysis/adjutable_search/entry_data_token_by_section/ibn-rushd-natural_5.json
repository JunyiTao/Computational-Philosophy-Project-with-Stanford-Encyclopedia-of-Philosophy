    "main_text": "Change or Motion\n6. Change or Motion\n\nIn Book III Aristotle defines motion once as \u201cthe perfection of\nthat which is in potentiality under the aspect that it is in\npotentiality\u201d (201a10\u201311) and another as \u201cthe\nperfection of that which is movable under the aspect that it is\nmovable\u201d (202a7\u20138). Before reaching the first passage,\nAverroes distinguishes four premises in Aristotle\u2019s approach to\ndefining motion (LC 86H TC3; Phys. III.1,\n200b25\u201332):\n\nBeing divides into actual and potential being\nAll beings belong to [at least] one of the ten Aristotelian\ncategories, praedicamenta.\nThe category of relation embraces the relation between more and\nless, as well as the relation between agent and patient.\nMotion occurs in more than one category (LC 87A TC4).\n\n\nBased on the evidence of four propositions, Averroes realizes that\nmotion does not have a univocal definition. Motion belongs to the\ngenus of the perfection toward which it intends, thus motion in\nsubstance belongs to the genus of substance, motions in quantity,\nplace and quality to the respective genera. But insofar as transition\ntowards a perfection is different from the perfection itself, motion\nis something different from its goal and Averroes affirms that,\nconsidered in this way, \u201cMotion must be a genus per se, for the\nway toward something is different from it [the end]\u201d,\nnecesse est ut sit genus per se, via enim ad rem est\naliud ab ipsa re (LC 87D TC4). For this reason he believes,\nAristotle classified motion in own category in his book on the\nCategories, and as we will see below, the category is being\naffected, passio.\n\nAverroes remarks that the definition of motion as belonging to the\ngenus of its perfection, is more adequate, verior, although\nthe definition of motion as a genus in itself, is better known,\nfamosior. In the Physics Aristotle deals accordingly\nwith the first definition, Averroes points out (LC 87E TC4). Medieval\nLatin philosophy would call this view of motion as genus in itself\n\u201ca flow of form\u201d fluxus formae, and the contrary\nview, \u201ca flowing form\u201d, forma fluens (Maier 1958:\n62\u201364).\n\nAverroes comments on the definition of Physics\n201a10\u201311: \u201cmotion is the perfection of that which is in\npotentiality under the aspect that it is in potentiality\u201d (LC\n87D, secundum quod) and says that the movable has two kinds\nof perfection, a perfection in actuality, and a perfection in\npotentiality, under the aspect of which it is called motion.\nThemistius elaborated on the distinction (CAG 5.2: 69:9\u201370:31 )\nand Philoponus emphasized it in his commentary (Philoponus, CAG 16:\n342:10\u2013344:7). Averroes could have received it either from\nPhiloponus (Lettinck 1994: 213) or Themistius (see above). He observes\nthat the definition is valid for both eternal and non-eternal classes\nof motion and he anticipates that the continuity of motion results\nfrom the definition itself (LC 88A TC6).\n\nAs for the definition of motion in Phys. 202a7\u20138,\n\u201cperfection of that which is movable\u201d, Averroes finds that\nit is more evident but that of Phys. 201a10\u201311,\n\u201cperfection of that which is in potentiality\u201d effectively\ntargets the substance of motion, demonstrat magis substantiam\nmotus (LC92A TC16).\n\nIn the Middle Commentary the premises for defining motion are\nthree:\n\nNatural beings are sometimes in potentiality, sometimes in\nactuality and \u201cthat is common to all ten categories\u201d;\nMotion belongs to the category of relation\n(hi\u1e63\u1e6darphut);\nMotion is said by analogy (MC 449G\u2013I; MC Kalonymos L\n28r\u00ba19\u201328v\u00ba8).\n\n\nThe definition of motion presented there is the verior one,\ni.e., motion belongs to the genus of its perfection, and it is not a\ncategory in itself.\n\nSince any change or motion requires two elements, the agent or mover\nand the patient or movable, Aristotle raises the question whether\nmotion is in the mover or the movable (Phys. III.3). Averroes\ngives following explanation: the mover acts in so far as it is form,\nthat is to say, in so far as it is in actuality, and the movable is\nmoved in so far as it is in potentiality, therefore the motion\n\u201cbecomes the same perfection of both of them\u201d (LC 92H\nTC18). Nevertheless, they are two kinds of perfection and Aristotle\nsaw here a dialectical difficulty (apor\u00eda logik\u0113,\nPhys. III.3, 202a21) with which Averroes deals at length (LC\n93F\u201394B TC19) but for Averroes the double character is no\ndifficulty: motion is one and the same according to the subject,\ndifferent according to the definition (LC 94K TC21).\n\nMotion in place is one kind of change but it is prior to the other\nkinds, to change in quality or alteration, to change in quantity or\ngrowth and decrease, and to change in substance, or coming-to-be and\npassing-away. Within local motion circular motion is the most perfect\nform and we will see how the universe is moved by circular motion.\n",
