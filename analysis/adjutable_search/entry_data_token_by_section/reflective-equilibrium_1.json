    "main_text": "Judgments || Considered Judgments\n1.1 Considered Judgments\n\nThe method of reflective equilibrium starts with judgments. An initial\nquestion is which of these judgments should be allowed entry to the\nprocess.\n\nAn obvious position with some appeal is to allow any\njudgments or intuitions. A permissive view says that\n\n\n[o]ur \u201cintuitions\u201d are simply opinions; our philosophical\ntheories are the same. Some are commonsensical, some are\nsophisticated; some are particular, some general; some are more firmly\nheld, some less. But they are all opinions, and a reasonable goal for\na philosopher is to bring them into equilibrium \u2026 If our\nofficial theories disagree with what we cannot help thinking outside\nthe philosophy room, then no real equilibrium has been reached. (Lewis\n1983: x; cf. Goodman 1965: 63\u201364)\n\n\nThis might seem cavalier, but we are at the moment only discussing the\nstarting point of the method. If reflective equilibrium does its job,\nour initial judgments may be transformed, and will at any rate cohere\nwith theoretical considerations.\n\nThe mainstream view, by contrast, suggests that only considered\njudgments should be used in reflective equilibrium. These are\n\u201cthose judgments in which our moral capacities are least likely\nto be displayed without distortion\u201d (Rawls 1971: 47). We should\n(1) be capable of reaching the right decision (e.g., be reasonably\nwell informed), (2) be in circumstances where we can do so (e.g., not\nbe scared or upset), and (3) be motivated to do so (e.g., not stand to\ngain or lose from the results of our deliberations). In short, we\nshould have the ability, opportunity, and desire to make the right\ndecision (Rawls 1971: 48). In moral and political philosophy, the\njudgments used in reflective equilibrium are usually these Rawlsian\nconsidered judgments.\n\nIntuitions are frequently used interchangeably with considered\njudgments in the critical literature on reflective equilibrium. But\nintuitions as typically described have characteristics that are not\ngenerally true of considered judgments, especially non-inferentiality\n(Brun 2014; Greenspan 2015; Cath 2016: 228\u2013229). This entry will\ntherefore focus on considered judgments rather than intuitions.\n",
