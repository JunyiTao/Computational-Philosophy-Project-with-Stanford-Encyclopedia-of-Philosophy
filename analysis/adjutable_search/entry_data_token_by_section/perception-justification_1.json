    "main_text": "Theories of Experience || Sense-datum Theories\n1.1 Sense-datum Theories\n\nOn sense-datum theories, whenever you have a visual experience as if\nthere is something present that is red, there really is something\npresent that is red\u2014a sense-datum. Now, in many cases of\nillusions and hallucination, there won\u2019t be any ordinary red\nthing around for you to experience even if there seems to you to be a\nred thing present. So sense-data are either going to be mental objects\nor strange non-mental objects. Sense-datum theories usually depart\nfrom the following principle:\n\nThe Phenomenal Principle\n\nWhenever you visually experience it to be that case that something is\n\\(F\\), then there is something \\(F\\)\nthat you experience (Robinson 1994).\n\nLet\u2019s first examine an epistemological case for sense-datum\ntheories. Here the direction of flow is from epistemology to the\nphilosophy of mind. We can find it in the following famous quote from\nH.H. Price:\n\n\nWhen I see a tomato there is much that I can doubt \u2026 One thing\nhowever I cannot doubt: that there exists a red patch of a round and\nsomewhat bulgy shape, standing out from a background of other\ncolour-patches, and having a certain visual depth, and that this whole\nfield of colour is presented to my consciousness \u2026 (Price 1932:\n3).\n\n\nOn Price\u2019s line of thought, perceptual experiences do afford us\nwith some certainty. When Price sees a tomato, he may be certain that\nthere is something red and round present. According to critics of the\nargument, Price is not entitled to be certain of any such thing. For\nexample, his experience might merely represent that there exists\nsomething red and round present, where such representation can occur\neven if nothing red and round is present (for more on this objection\nsee the entry on\n the problem of perception\n (section 3.1.2).\n\nLet\u2019s now turn to the status of beliefs about ordinary objects\nin the external world, and the flow from the philosophy of mind to\nepistemology. We can organize our discussion under the following\ninstance of the trio:\n\nEpistemology\n\nExperiences justify beliefs about the external world.\n\nEpistemology-Mind Link 1\n\nIf experiences justify beliefs about the external world, then\nexperiences are not relations to sense-data.\n\nMind 1\n\nExperiences are relations to sense-data.\n\nIn principle, a sense-datum theorist might accept E-M Link 1 and Mind\n1, and conclude that Epistemology is false. For example, she might\ntake up a coherence theory of justification, on which our beliefs\nabout the external world are justified by their coherence with each\nother and not by experiences (see the entry on\n sense-data\n (section 3.2).\n\nIn the usual line of discussion, philosophers affirm Epistemology and\nE-M Link 1, and conclude that Mind 1 is false (see Berkeley 1710/2008:\nsect 18 or Reid 1764/1997: ch. 1). Sense-datum theories tell us that\nthe things we are directly aware of in perceptual experience are not\nordinary external objects. As the common metaphor has it, sense-data\ntheories draw a veil of ideas over the world. The usual\nobjection holds that this veil makes it impossible for us to gain\nknowledge or justified belief from experience about the external\nworld. Philosophers such as Berkeley and Reid reject sense-datum\ntheories on the grounds that we do have epistemic access to the\nworld.\n\nIn response, the sense-datum theorist might deny E-M Link 1. In\nparticular, the theorist might say that experiences justify beliefs\nabout the external world when complemented with reflection on how they\nare best explained (Russell 1912). Call this the IBE approach since it\nconcerns Inferences to the Best Explanation of our experiences (see\nVogel 1990 for more contemporary discussion). Setting aside debate\nabout how such an explanation might go, and why it might be the best,\nthe response might not go far enough.\n\nTo see why the IBE approach might not go far enough, consider the idea\nthat experiences provide non-inferential justification for\nbeliefs about the external world. If experiences provide\nnon-inferential justification for beliefs about the external world,\nthey justify beliefs through a route that does not involve further\nbeliefs. Compare how your sharp pain might justify you directly in\nbelieving that you are in pain, without further beliefs playing any\nrole. Contrast how your thermometer might justify you in believing you\nhave a fever only in conjunction with your having reason to believe\nthe thermometer works. Non-inferential justification is justification\nthat does not involve auxiliary beliefs (see Pryor 2005 for more\ndetail).\n\nOn the IBE approach, it seems that experiences at best give us\ninferential justification for beliefs about the external world.\nThat\u2019s because they justify us only in conjunction with whatever\nbeliefs their best explanation brings in. Experiences arguably do\nbetter (Johnston 2006). The veil of ideas objection might then be\nbetter put as follows:\n\nEpistemology1\n\nExperiences give non-inferential justification for beliefs about the\nexternal world.\n\nEpistemology-Mind Link 2\n\nIf experiences give non-inferential justification for beliefs about\nthe external world, then experiences are not relations to\nsense-data.\n\nSo,\n\nnot-Mind 1\n\nExperiences are not relations to sense-data.\n\nEven still, it is unclear why sense-datum theories should rule out\ngetting non-inferential justification from experiences. Perhaps if a\nsense-datum theory is true, we at best see external objects\nindirectly, by means of seeing sense-data. But this is only a point\nabout seeing. Our justification for beliefs could still be\nnon-inferential (Moore 1953; Silins 2011). The crucial question for\nnon-inferential justification is about the role of background beliefs,\nand the mental process of indirect perception need not make use of\nbackground beliefs. For instance, whether you indirectly perceive\nobjects by means of sense-data might instead just be a matter of how\nthe sense-data are caused, leaving open the possibility that you gain\nnon-inferential justification for beliefs about the external world\nfrom sense-data.\n\nLet\u2019s now zoom out to a big picture assessment of the epistemic\nimplications of sense-datum theories.\n\nThe thought driving the veil of ideas worry is that if experiences\nfail to put us in direct contact with reality, then they cannot\njustify beliefs about external reality. This thought is meant to get\nus to the conclusion that sense datum theory is false. But it might go\ntoo far.\n\nThe first ramification concerns seeing objects. According to many\nviews, we see ordinary extended objects by seeing their surfaces,\nrather than seeing them directly (see Moore 1918 or Broad 1952, and\nClarke 1965 or Campbell 2004 for dispute). As far as seeing objects\ngoes, their facing surfaces play the same role as sense-data did on\nmany versions of the sense-datum theory\u2014intermediaries not\nidentical with objects that still permit us to see objects by seeing\nthem. But now, if we endorse the veil of ideas objection, there is a\nrisk that the facing surfaces of objects will be a veil over the rest\nof external reality. Call this the veil of surfaces. Our\nexperiences might fail to give us access to whether we live in a world\nof ever shifting facades or instead a world of three-dimensional\nobjects as they are ordinarily conceived. Descartes arguably states\nthis problem when he writes:\n\n\nI remember that, when looking from a window and saying I see men who\npass in the street, I really do not see them, but infer that what I\nsee is men, just as I say that I see wax. And yet what do I see from\nthe window but hats and coats which may cover automatic machines? (PW,\np. 21 )\n\n\nIf the veil of ideas objection succeeds against sense-data theories,\nit might also rule out the theory that we directly perceive only\nsurfaces. It is not clear whether the objection can get us that\nfar.\n\nThe veil of ideas objection also has controversial ramifications for\ncases of illusion or hallucination. When something looks red to you\nwhen it isn\u2019t, or when you have a hallucination of a bloody\ndagger in front of you, your experience fails to put you in direct\ncontact with reality as it is. According to many approaches, your\nexperience might still\u2014misleadingly\u2014justify you in\nbelieving that reality is the way it visually appears to be. However,\nif the thought driving the veil of ideas objection is correct,\nexperiences only justify in those cases when you are seeing things as\nthey are. This is quite a demanding view, one that rules out\njustification in a wide range of cases where many think it is present.\n(For more discussion of views that exclude perceptual justification\nfrom cases of illusion or hallucination,\n see section 2.2.).\n",
