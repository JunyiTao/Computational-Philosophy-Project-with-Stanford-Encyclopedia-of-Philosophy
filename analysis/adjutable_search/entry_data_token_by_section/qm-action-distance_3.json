    "main_text": "Action at a distance, holism and non-separability || Action at a distance\n4.1 Action at a distance\n\n\nIn orthodox quantum mechanics as well as in any other current quantum\ntheory that postulates non-locality (i.e., influences between distant,\nspace-like separated systems), the influences between the distant\nmeasurement events in the EPR/B experiment do not propagate\ncontinuously in space-time. They seem to involve action at a\ndistance. Yet, a common view has it that these influences are due to\nsome type of holism and/or non-separability of states of composite\nsystems, which are characteristic of systems in entangled states (like\nthe spin singlet state), and which exclude the very possibility of\naction at a distance. The paradigm case of action at a distance is the\nNewtonian gravitational force. This force acts between distinct\nobjects that are separated by some (non-vanishing) spatial distance,\nits influence is symmetric (in that any two massive objects influence\neach other), instantaneous and does not propagate continuously in\nspace. And it is frequently claimed or presupposed that such action at\na distance could only exist between systems with separate states in\nnon-holistic universes (i.e., universes in which the states of\ncomposite systems are determined by, or supervene upon the states of\ntheir subsystems and the spacetime relations between them), which are\ncommonly taken to characterize the classical\n realm.[9]\n\n\nIn sections 4.2 and 4.3, we shall briefly review the relevant\nnotions of holism and non-separability (for a more comprehensive\nreview, see the entry on holism and nonseparability in physics and\nHealey 1991). In section 5, we shall discuss the nature of holism and\nnon-separability in the quantum realm as depicted by various quantum\ntheories. Based on this discussion, we shall consider whether the\nnon-local influences in the EPR/B experiment constitute action at a\ndistance.\n",
