I know that my glasses are not on the table\nbut how? Dharmak\u012brti would answer, \u201cBy inference,\u201d\ninferential knowledge of an absence being one of three fundamental\ntypes identified by the Yog\u0101c\u0101rin (see above). \u201cIf an\nelephant were in the room, I (S) would perceive it. I (S) do not\nperceive an elephant. Therefore, there is no elephant in the\nroom\u201d\u2014similarly for my glasses not being on the table (presuming the\ntable is not so cluttered that they could be concealed). Gautama and\nV\u0101tsy\u0101yana, without elaborating, agree that absences are\nknown inferentially (Ny\u0101ya-s\u016btra 2.2.2). But\nUddyotakara and the later tradition argue that we know absences\nsometimes perceptually. I cognize immediately my glasses\u2019 absence when\nI look for them on the table.\n\nBh\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6da\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 says no, there is\noperative here a special knowledge source called \u201cnon-cognition\u201d or\n\u201cnon-perception,\u201d anupalabdhi. The main arguments center on\nthe sufficiency of perception, or inference, to make known such\nnegative facts, which clearly we do know. The\nBh\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6da argues, for example,\nthat perception makes known only presences. Indeed, Ny\u0101ya has a\ndifficult time assimilating such knowledge to its theory of perception,\nin particular since the difficulty widens into what is known in\nanalytic philosophy as the generality problem. Ny\u0101ya recognizes\nthat an absence has a peculiar relational structure, namely, to relate\na locus (the table) to a counterpositive (my glasses) and that the idea of the counterpositive\nis furnished by the cognizer entirely from memory. If memory can have such a\ncrucial role in a type of perception, how then to draw the limits on\nwhat is perceptible? The Ny\u0101ya project threatens to spin out of\ncontrol. Not surprisingly, therefore, there is a large literature on\nabsence and its epistemology.\n",
