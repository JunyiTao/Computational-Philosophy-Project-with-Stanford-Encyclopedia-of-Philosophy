    "main_text": "Political Obligation in Historical Perspective || The Social Contract\n1.3 The Social Contract\n\nAlthough the idea of the social contract long antedates the modern era\n(Gough 1967), its full development occurred in the seventeenth\ncentury, when Thomas Hobbes and John Locke used the theory to rather\ndifferent ends. Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Immanuel Kant, and other\nphilosophers have also relied on social contract theory \u2013 in\nKant\u2019s case, in ways we will examine below (\u00a71.5) \u2013 but the\nclassic expressions of the contract theory of political obligation\nremain Hobbes\u2019s Leviathan (1651) and Locke\u2019s Second\nTreatise of Government (1690).\n\nFor Hobbes, social contract theory established the authority of anyone\nwho was able to wield and hold power. If we imagine ourselves in a\nstate of nature, he argued, with no government and no law to guide us\nbut the law of nature, we will recognize that everyone is naturally\nequal and independent. But we should also recognize that this state of\nnature will also be a state of war, for the \u201crestless desire\nfor Power after power\u201d that drives all of us will lead to\n\u201ca warre of every man against every man\u201d (Hobbes, chaps.\n11, 13). To escape so dreadful a condition, people surrender their\nindependence by entering into a covenant to obey a sovereign power\nthat will have the authority to make, enforce, and interpret laws.\nThis form of the social contract Hobbes called \u201csovereignty by\ninstitution.\u201d But he also insisted that conquerors acquire\nauthority over those they subject to their rule \u2013\n\u201csovereignty by acquisition\u201d \u2013 when they allow those\nsubjects to go about their business. In either case, Hobbes said, the\nsubjects consent to obey those who have effective power over them,\nwhether the subject has a choice in who holds power or not. Because\nthey consent, they therefore have an obligation to obey the sovereign,\nwhether sovereignty be instituted or acquired.\n\nExactly how much Locke differs from Hobbes in his conclusions is a\nmatter of scholarly dispute, but there is no doubt that he puts the\nsame concepts to work for what seem to be more limited ends. According\nto Locke, the free and equal individuals in the state of nature\nestablish government as a way of overcoming the\n\u201cinconveniencies\u201d of that state. Moreover, Locke\u2019s social\ncontract appears to have two stages. In the first stage the naturally\nfree and equal individuals agree to form themselves into a political\nsociety, under law, and in the second they establish the government.\nThis move allows Locke to argue, contrary to Hobbes, for a right of\nrevolution on the ground that overthrowing the government will not\nimmediately return the people to the state of nature. Nor does he\nhold, with Hobbes, that mere submission to a conqueror constitutes a\nform of consent to the conqueror\u2019s rule.\n\nLocke does agree with Hobbes, of course, in deriving obligations to\nobey the law from the consent of the governed. In developing his\nargument, however, he reveals several problems that have bedeviled\nsocial contract theory. One has to do with the nature of the contract:\nis it historical or hypothetical? If the former, then the problem is\nto show that most people truly have entered into such a contract (at\nleast if one\u2019s aim is to show that most people have a duty to\nobey the law). If the contract is meant to be a device that\nillustrates how people would have given their consent, on the\nother hand, then the difficulty is that a hypothetical contract\n\u201cis no contract at all\u201d (Dworkin, 1977, p. 151). Two more\nproblems concern how to characterize acts that count as consent.\nThough Hobbes maintains that submission to a conqueror qualifies as\nsuch an act, few are now likely to accept that agreement at the point\nof a sword gives rise to a moral obligation to obey (as opposed to a\nprudential reason to do so). Indeed, it is not clear that consent is\nreally the key to political obligation in Hobbes\u2019s theory;\nrather, we have an obligation to obey anyone who can maintain order.\nAs for Locke, he seems to stretch the notion of tacit consent too far\nwhen he states, in \u00a7119 of the Second Treatise, that the\n\u201cvery being of anyone within the territories\u201d expresses a\nperson\u2019s willing submission to the rule of its government.\n\nOne of the first to find fault with the argument from consent or\ncontract was David Hume. In \u201cOf the Original Contract,\u201d\npublished in 1752, Hume takes particular exception to the appeal to\ntacit consent. To say that most people have given their consent to\nobey the laws simply by remaining in their country of birth is\ntantamount to saying that someone tacitly consents to obey a\nship\u2019s captain \u201cthough he was carried on board while\nasleep and must leap into the ocean and perish the moment he leaves\nher\u201d (1953, p. 51). For Hume, the obligation to obey the law\nderives not from consent or contract but from the straightforward\nutility of a system of laws that enables people to pursue their\ninterests peacefully and conveniently.\n",
