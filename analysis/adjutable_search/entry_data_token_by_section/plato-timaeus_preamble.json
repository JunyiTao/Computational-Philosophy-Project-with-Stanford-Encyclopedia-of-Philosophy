    "main_text": "\n\nIn the Timaeus Plato presents an elaborately wrought account\nof the formation of the universe and an explanation of its impressive\norder and beauty. The universe, he proposes, is the product of\nrational, purposive, and beneficent agency. It is the handiwork of a\ndivine Craftsman (\u201cDemiurge,\u201d d\u00eamiourgos,\n28a6) who, imitating an unchanging and eternal model, imposes\nmathematical order on a preexistent chaos to generate the ordered\nuniverse (kosmos). The governing explanatory principle of the\naccount is teleological: the universe as a whole as well as its\nvarious parts are so arranged as to produce a vast array of good\neffects. For Plato this arrangement is not fortuitous, but the outcome\nof the deliberate intent of Intellect (nous),\nanthropomorphically represented by the figure of the Craftsman who\nplans and constructs a world that is as excellent as its nature\npermits it to be.\n\nThe beautiful orderliness of the universe is not only the\nmanifestation of Intellect; it is also the model for rational souls to\nunderstand and to emulate. Such understanding and emulation restores\nthose souls to their original state of excellence, a state that was\nlost in their embodiment. There is, then, an explicit ethical and\nreligious dimension to the discourse.\n\nThis picture of a divinely created universe, though controversial from\nthe start (see below, section 2), has captured the imagination and\nadmiration of numerous generations of philosophers and theologians\nthrough the\n centuries.[1]\n Because of the vast scope of the work, as well as its character as a\nmonologue\u2014by excluding exchanges between interlocutors the\ndiscourse is much more like an authoritative statement than a set of\nquestions to be investigated\u2014the Timaeus was generally\ntaken to be the culmination of its author\u2019s intellectual\nachievement, particularly by thinkers in sympathy with its portrayal\nof the universe. This also seems to have been one of the reasons for\nits early translation into Latin. Calcidius\u2019 Latin translation\nin the fourth century CE made it the only text of Plato available in\nthe Middle Ages in the Latin West until the twelfth century. While it\nstill was an important reference point for Kepler, its influence began\nto wane over time. In the latter part of the nineteenth and earlier\npart of the twentieth century interest in the Timaeus was\nagain stimulated by the refinement of philological methods and exact\nhistorical\n scholarship,[2]\n but for most of the second half of the twentieth century the dialogue\nwas frequently dismissed as philosophically insignificant at best and\nregressive at worst. It played an important role in debates about the\ndevelopment of Plato\u2019s philosophy, but not much more. Recent\ndecades, however, have witnessed a strong revival of interest in the\nTimaeus: philosophers, historians of science and of ideas,\nand philologists, while not necessarily persuaded by the\ndialogue\u2019s bold claims, have been fascinated by its majestic\naccount and have sympathetically entered into and sought to elucidate\nits conceptual structure.\n",
