The topic is implicated in general discussions about how to approach hermeneutics, in particular by M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 and Ved\u0101nta philosophers. Particular doctrinal or philosophical positions presented in, for example, the Upani\u1e63ads or the Vedas, are subject to scrutiny based on whether they should be taken literally or not. The M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 system of hermeneutics, as Rajendran (2001) and McCrea (2008) have shown, subsequently comes to influence the analysis of poetic meaning.\nWhile he is not a M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka (he is called a sarva-tantra-sva-tantra, someone for whom all systems are his own), even V\u0101caspati, in his Drop of Truth mentioned above, takes up the question of the impact of theories of secondary meaning on the interpretation of the Vedas. He is a proponent of the view that indication acts as \u201cglue,\u201d metaphorically speaking, and secures the relationship between word-meanings\u2014but this might threaten the possibility that the Vedas convey meaning secondarily, since indication requires appeal to speaker intention to make sense. This, says his opponent, threatens Vedic authority. While V\u0101caspati\u2019s initial dry remark is to say, well, so much for Vedic authority, he steps back by postulating that the ordinary use of elders (vrddhavyavah\u0101ra) lets us understand, lacking a genuine person who authors the words. He thus preserves the principle that Vedic and ordinary language are cut from the same cloth, as both require indication for sentence meaning (Sastri 2014; Phillips 2015).\nIn the Thorough Investigation of Truth (Tattvasam\u012bk\u1e63\u0101), a commentary on Ma\u1e47\u1e0dana Mi\u015bra\u2019s The Demonstration of Brahman (Brahmasiddhi), V\u0101caspati argues for the truth of the Upani\u1e63adic claim of non-duality between self and reality, against an interlocutor who would interpret the Upani\u1e63ads in a figurative manner. At stake is the role of language in relationship to other sources of knowledge. The opponent objects to the conflict between sense perception and the putatively ordinary meaning of the Upani\u1e63ads, since this would entail that sense perception\u2014which delivers knowledge of a world apart from the self\u2014is flawed. They argue that, when such conflicts arise, perception should prevail, and a figurative meaning should be preferred. V\u0101caspati objects on a number of grounds, first noting that there must be a relationship between a primary and secondary meaning (one cannot simply leap to a secondary meaning when it is convenient). Then he appeals to the principle already described in detail\u2014when it is not possible to interpret the ordinary meaning in a sensible manner, this is the impetus for secondary meaning. Conflict with other knowledge sources is not the catalyst for figurative interpretation (V\u0101caspatimi\u015bra, VT: 29\u201332).\n",
