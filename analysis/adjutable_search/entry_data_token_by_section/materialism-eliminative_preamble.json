    "main_text": "\n\nEliminative materialism (or eliminativism) is the radical\nclaim that our ordinary, common-sense understanding of the mind is\ndeeply wrong and that some or all of the mental states posited by\ncommon-sense do not actually exist and have no role to play in a\nmature science of the mind. Descartes famously challenged much of what\nwe take for granted, but he insisted that, for the most part, we can\nbe confident about the content of our own minds. Eliminative\nmaterialists go further than Descartes on this point, since they\nchallenge the existence of various mental states that Descartes took\nfor granted.\n",
