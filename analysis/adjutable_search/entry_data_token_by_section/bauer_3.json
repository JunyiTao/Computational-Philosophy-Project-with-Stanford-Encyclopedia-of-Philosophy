    "main_text": "Bauer\u2019s Late Work, 1850\u20131882\n4. Recent Developments\n\nBauer\u2019s bicentennary in September 2009 was the occasion for a\nthree-day international conference, held at the\nFriedrich-Schiller-Universit\u00e4t, Jena, and in Bauer\u2019s nearby\nbirthplace of Eisenberg, to examine his problematic legacy for\nphilosophy, theology, and social thought. The conference sought to\nretrieve the complex theoretical debates underlying the collapse of\nthe Hegelian system. Bauer\u2019s reformulation and radicalisation of\nHegel were contrasted with the criticisms of Ludwig Feuerbach, Max\nStirner, and Karl Marx; and the specific character of his Vorm\u00e4rz\nradicalism was underlined, whether in his republicanism or in his\ntheological insights and critique. Disputed issues involved the\ncontent, continuity, and political bearing of Bauer\u2019s pre-1848\nworks, his relations with his contemporaries in the Hegelian School,\nthe question of his anti-Semitism, and his attitudes toward\nimperialism and history after 1848. Also highlighted was the later\nBauer\u2019s reception by twentieth-century conservatives such as\nCarl Schmitt. The Proceedings of the conference were published in 2010\n(Kodalle and Reitz, eds., 2010)\n\nAn important dimension of recent\nwork is a closer specification of Bauer\u2019s early interpretation of\nHegel, especially through the recently-published 1828 Lectures on\nAesthetics (Schimmenti 2020), and an investigation of Bauer\u2019s\nrelations to Karl Marx in 1839 to 1842 (Kangal 2020). The question of\nthe politicization of art by conservative forces in Prussia after\n1840, and the Left-Hegelian responses to this tendency, including\nBauer\u2019s, are examined in Schimmenti 2021.\n\nAnother aspect of recent Bauer research is a more thorough elaboration\nof his 1840\u2019s perfectionist ethic, through the application to\nhis thought of the concept of \u2018post-Kantian perfectionism\u2019\n(Moggach 2011; Sorensen and Moggach 2020). In Leibniz or Christian\nWolff, pre-Kantian perfectionist doctrines, of Aristotelian\ninspiration, stressed the ethical objective of happiness (broadly\nunderstood as material, intellectual, and spiritual wellbeing) and the\ncomplementarity of properly understood individual interests.\nPost-Kantian perfectionism acknowledges Kant\u2019s critique of these\nearlier eudaemonist forms (described by him as \u2018rational\nheteronomy\u2019), with their implications of political tutelage and\npaternalistic \u2018enlightened despotism\u2019. Unwilling to\nrelinquish the terrain of self-fashioning and self-realisation,\nhowever, which Kant depoliticises but retains in his doctrine of\nvirtue, post-Kantian perfectionists like Schiller, Fichte, or Bauer\nseek a reformulation rather than a complete repudiation of\nperfectionist ethics, one that would be compatible with modern\nrepublican forms of life. Instead of happiness, these new versions\nstress the central value of freedom as a process or a conquest. The\nend in light of which actions, relations, and legal forms and\ninstitutions can be assessed is rational self-determination and the\npromotion of the necessary political and social conditions of its\nexercise. Whereas the older perfectionism had in general envisaged the\nthriving of a relatively fixed human nature, the post-Kantian versions\nstress the historical variability of cultural experiences and the\ndeterminability rather than the fixity of the self, its openness to\ncritique and self-conscious fashioning. In contrast to older views,\nthe harmony and complementarity of interests is a problematic task, an\naspect of rational self-shaping, rather than a preconceived given. The\ndiversity and conflictual character of modern life, the culture of\ndiremption as Schiller and Hegel had described it, must be taken into\naccount as the material element of a post-Kantian perfectionist ethic.\nBruno Bauer\u2019s conceptions of history and emancipation in the\n1840s, it has been argued, are consistent with this approach.\n\nA contrasting tendency in recent research is to revive older views of\nthe Hegelian School as a whole, or in particular of Bauer, as\nphilosophically vacuous and politically disengaged, or else\npolitically counterproductive. Such a view originated in Marx\u2019s\ndevastating depictions in the Holy Family, in Arnold Ruge\u2019s\npolemics with the Berlin Hegelians known as Die Freien (\u201cThe\nFree\u201d) in late 1842\u201343, and in other contemporary sources\nsuch as Rudolf Haym (1857), who attributed the failures of the\nRevolution of 1848 to the excessive radicalism of Hegel\u2019s\nyouthful followers. An analogous judgement has recently been made on\nthe Hegelian movement (de Vos, 2012), with the New Hegelians being\ndistanced from Hegel as promoters of mere ideology rather than serious\nengagement with philosophical and political issues. While rejecting\nsuch negative judgements on the Hegelian School as a whole, the editor\nof a recent important documentary collection from the period is highly\ncritical of Bruno Bauer, arguing that both his philosophical\nimportance and his personal prominence in the Hegelian movement have\nbeen inflated in recent research (Hundt 2010, Apparat, pp.\n43\u201344). In his otherwise very positive review, Michael Quante\noffers a rejoinder to Hundt\u2019s conclusions on Bauer (Quante,\n2010, 201\u201302). In other recent work, Sorensen (2011) validates\nBauer\u2019s republican credentials before 1848, and examines his\nsubsequent disillusionment, along with that of his fellow\nLeft-Hegelian radicals after the defeat of the revolutions. Greiert\n(2020) examines Bauer\u2019s anti-Semitism as an adaptation of\nEnlightenment rationality, and argues that Bauer\u2019s final works, in\ndepicting early Christianity as a popular revolutionary movement\nagainst the power structures of the ancient world, foreshadow some\nforms of contemporary populism.\n\nA recent French edition of La trompette du jugement dernier\n(trans. Henri-Alexis Baatsch, with a commentary by Nicolas Dessaux\ntitled \u201cDe Marx comme trompettiste\u201d) contains a\ntranslation of Bauer\u2019s anonymous 1841 text, Die Posaune des\nj\u00fcngsten Gerichts. This new translation slightly revises\nBaatsch\u2019s earlier translation of La Trompette du jugement\ndernier contre Hegel, l\u2019ath\u00e9e et\nl\u2019ant\u00e9christ. Un ultimatum (1841). Dessaux\u2019s\ncommentary revives the authorship debate surrounding Die\nPosaune and its continuation, Hegel\u2019s Lehre der\nReligion und Kunst (1842), by attributing much of the earlier\ntext to Karl Marx, though previous literature has challenged similar\nclaims. The grounds offered by Dessaux are that Marx possessed the\nrequisite philosophical and biblical competence to compose the text\nhimself, and that it contains typically Marxian turns of phrase. The\nissue of Marx\u2019s potential collaboration on these texts had been\nraised previously; for example, the 1967 reissue of Hegels\nLehre by Scientia Verlag, Aalen, had identified Marx as the\npossible author of the section of that text entitled \u201cHegels\nHa\u00df gegen die heilige Geschichte und die g\u00f6ttliche Kunst\nder heiligen Geschichtsschreibung\u201d (pp. 67\u2013227). For\nearlier literature that questions the attribution to Marx, see Moggach\n2003 (p. 222, note 59). The question of possible collaboration is also\ndiscussed in Marx-Engels Gesamtausgabe (MEGA1), David\nRyazanov (ed.), 1929, I/2, p XLIV.  The relevant literature on a\npossible Marx collaboration is detailed in Kangal 2020, n. 9 and 16.\n",
