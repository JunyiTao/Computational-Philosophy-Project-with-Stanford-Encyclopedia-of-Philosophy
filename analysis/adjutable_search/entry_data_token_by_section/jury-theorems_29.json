    "main_text": "Background and Selected Applications || Jury theorems and social epistemology\n6.2 Jury theorems and social epistemology\n\nSocial epistemology can be roughly divided into epistemology\nof groups and epistemology in groups (Dietrich and\nSpiekermann forthcoming). Jury theorems matter to the former, and\nindirectly also to the latter.\n\nEpistemology of groups analyses how groups can be knowers and\nhow they perform as knowers. A lively debate among applied social\nepistemologists explores how (and how well) different institutions\npromote group knowledge. Alvin Goldman\u2019s seminal Knowledge\nin a Social World (1999), for example, draws on Condorcet\u2019s\nJury Theorem in his social-epistemological analysis of democracy. The\ndebate extends to courts (Spiekermann & Goodin 2012; Sunstein\n2009; Vermeule 2009), to the internet (Masterton, Olsson and Angere\n2016), and even to knowledge of the scientific community and its\nperception by the wider public (Hahn, Harris, & Corner 2016).\nStretching the boundaries of social epistemology further, one could\neven say that animal decision-making can be more or less conducive to\ngroup knowledge (e.g., Conradt & List 2009).\n\nJury theorems matter more indirectly to social epistemology\nin groups, especially belief revision under peer\ndisagreement. How ought one revise one\u2019s beliefs when learning\nthe beliefs of others? Many have argued that the number of peers,\ntheir competence and their independence all matter (Elga 2010; Kelly\n2011; Lackey 2013). Barnett (2019), for example, discusses peer\ndisagreement with a \u201cgroup representative\u201d who adopts the\ngroup\u2019s majority view. Jury theorems can help approach such\nquestions systematically.\n\nThe jury theorem literature also offers analyses of opinion\nindependence in social contexts, distinguishing between different\nnotions of independence: causal independence,\nprobabilistic (\u201cstatistical\u201d,\n\u201cevidential\u201d) independence, and reasoning\nindependence (a form of autonomy of agents); see\n Section 2.2 and\n Lackey (2013). None of these notions entails another, but they are\noften unhelpfully mixed up.\n",
