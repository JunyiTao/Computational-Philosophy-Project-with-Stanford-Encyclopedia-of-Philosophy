    "main_text": "The Structure of Appearance\n4. The Structure of Appearance\nThe Structure of Appearance is perhaps Goodman\u2019s main\nwork, although it is less widely known than, for\nexample, Languages of Art. It is, in fact, a heavily revised\nversion of Goodman\u2019s Ph.D. thesis, A Study of Qualities. SA\nis a constitutional system, which, just like Rudolf Carnap\u2019s Der\nlogische Aufbau der Welt, shows how from a basis of primitive\nobjects and a basic relation between those objects all other objects\ncan be obtained by definitions alone. We commented above already on\nthe anti-foundationalist nature of both Carnap\u2019s and Goodman\u2019s\nconstitutional systems. For them, the point of carrying out such a\nconstruction was not to provide a foundationalist reduction to some\nprivileged basis (of experience or ontology), but rather to study the\nnature and logic of constitutional systems as such. In this sense,\nGoodman\u2019s interest in other \u201cworld versions\u201d, such as the\nlanguages of art, should be seen as a continuation of his project in\nSA.\n",
