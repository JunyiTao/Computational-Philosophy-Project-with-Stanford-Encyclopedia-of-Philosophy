Scholars of Buddhism may object that it was Nishida\u2019s own\nknowledge of Buddhism that remained too much at the level of personal\nexperience, rather than the sophisticated discourses of Abhidharma,\nM\u0101dhyamaka, Yog\u0101c\u0101ra, Tiantai, and Huayan traditions of\nBuddhist philosophy themselves.\n\nIn any case, in the development of Nishida\u2019s thought,\n\u201cbeing\u201d is thought of in terms of the objectivity of\ndeterminate things, \u201crelative nothingness\u201d is understood\nas a mere privation or simple negation of being, and an enveloping\nsense of \u201cnothingness\u201d is provisionally associated with a\nkind of transcendental subjectivity of consciousness or the\nheart-mind. Ultimately, however, Nishida comes to posit absolute\nnothingness as the \u201cplace\u201d (basho) that embraces\nboth subjective (noetic) and objective (noematic) dimensions\nof reality. Thus, he relegates not only privation of being but also\nsubjective nothingness, in the sense of the \u201cfield of\nconsciousness,\u201d to a type of \u201crelative\n nothingness.\u201d[10]\n\nIn 1934 Nishida writes: \u201cReality is being and at the same time\nnothingness; it is being-and-nothingness [u-soku-mu],\nnothingness-and-being; it is both subjective and objective, noetic and\nnoematic. Reality is the unity of subjectivity and objectivity, and\nthus the self-identity of what is absolutely contradictory. Or rather,\nit is not that [the separate spheres of] subjectivity and objectivity\ncome to unite, and then we first have reality. [The opposition of]\nsubjectivity and objectivity must instead be thought from out of a\ndynamically dialectical reality that is self-determining\u201d (NKZ\nVII, 441; see Nishida 1970, 29). Reality, as the dialectical\n\u201cself-determination of absolute nothingness,\u201d is in\nNishida\u2019s later works understood as a dynamic \u201cidentity of\nthe absolute contradiction\u201d between subjective (relative)\nnothingness and objective being. Absolute nothingness is the temporal\nand spatial \u201cplace\u201d wherein individual persons and things\ndetermine one another in their mutual interactions.\n\nThe \u201cplace of absolute nothingess\u201d (zettai-mu no\nbasho) first became the central concept of Nishida\u2019s\nthought in the mid-1920s, though he continued to develop and rethink\nthe idea up until his last completed essay in 1945, \u201cThe Logic\nof Place and the Religious Worldview.\u201d Nishida first explicitly\nworked out an idea of absolute nothingness in his 1926 book, From\nThat Which Acts to That Which Sees (NKZ IV), a book which\ninaugurated his middle-period of thought. In this work, which includes\nan important essay entitled \u201cPlace\u201d\n(\u201cBasho\u201d), Nishida\u2019s topological reasoning\ndevelops in rough outline as\n follows[11]:\n\nJust as all events must \u201ctake place\u201d somewhere, all beings\nmust be situated in some place. Beings always exist in relation to\nother beings, and any relation requires a third term, namely, the\nplace or medium wherein they are related. In other words, for A and B\nto be related, there must be some place, C, in which their relation is\nsituated. To begin with, we can understand this C as the spatial\n\u201ccontext\u201d in which objects are situated in relation to one\nanother. But the context in which things are defined is more than\nspatial; a thing is not only here as opposed to there. Things are\ndetermined according to a number of criteria, each of which operates\nwithin its own field of judgment. Hence, the place C can be further\nunderstood as a \u201ccategory\u201d of judgment, such as the\nquality \u201ccolor.\u201d Red and blue are revealed, and contrasted\nwith one another, as colors within the same color field.\n\nIn order to let concrete things reveal themselves yet more fully,\nhowever, we should think of C as \u201cconsciousness.\u201d Our\nminds are able to correlate various categories of judgment, such as\ncolor, size, shape, location, etc., and therefore to perceive\nindividual things as composed of unique combinations of various\nqualities and relations. For example, we are conscious of a certain\nthing as a round, soft, red, sweet, apple sitting on a table. The\nfield of consciousness is the field in which these different\ncategories are unified in the perception and judgment of the qualities\nof a particular thing in relation to other particular things and their\nqualities.\n\nUltimately, however, there is a crucial limit to the subjective\n\u201cfield of consciousness.\u201d As Kant demonstrated, subjective\nconsciousness cannot reflect things as they are in themselves, but\nonly as they appear when schematized according to subjective\ncategories. What, then, is the ultimate place wherein the encounter\nbetween subjects and objects takes place, wherein persons and things\ncoexist? According to Nishida, this must be the place wherein persons\nand things not only undergo changes in accidental categorical\nqualities, but wherein they essentially and existentially \u201ccome\nto be and pass away.\u201d It is the place, not just of intellectual\njudgments, but of birth and death. This ultimate \u201cgroundless\nground,\u201d which \u201cenvelops\u201d all beings, yet which does\nso in such a way that lets them contain their own principle of\nself-determination, Nishida calls \u201cthe place of true\nnothingness.\u201d Although in no sense a determinate being, neither\nis this place of true or absolute nothingness a mere static vacuity.\nIt must be thought of as both the epistemic source of consciousness\nand the ontological origin of beings.\n\nAlthough Nishida comes to the idea of the place of absolute\nnothingness most directly through his confrontations with Kant and\nNeo-Kantianism, he does not shy from thinking this place in\nmetaphysical as well as epistemological terms: nothingness is not\nmerely a reflective, but is also a creative principle (NKZ IV,\n238\u201339). As he writes much later, \u201cabsolute nothingness at\nonce transcends everything and is that by which everything is\nconstituted\u201d (NKZ IX, 6). And yet, Nishida repeatedly tells us\nthat, as no-thing outside of or other than the place of the coming to\nbe and passing away of truly individual beings, absolute nothingness\nis not to be thought of as a \u201ctranscendent\nbeing.\u201d Nor is it to be understood as the processional unfolding\nof a \u201cpotential being,\u201d that is to say, as a kind of\nHegelian \u201cworld Spirit\u201d with its own cunning reason at\nwork behind the scenes of its historical march toward\nself-realization. The absolute, according to Nishida, must be thought\nof as nothingness in order to distinguish it from all ontologies that\nwould reduce the uniqueness and autonomy of truly individual beings\neither to a transcendent being or to an underlying mechanical or\nteleological process.\n\nOne of the driving concerns behind Nishida\u2019s repeated insistence\nthat the absolute be thought of in the meontological terms of a\nformless, indeterminate place of absolute nothingness, is that only\ntherein can self-determining and irreducibly singular individuals be\ngiven their due. All ontologies of universal being fail to allow for\nthe existence of the \u201ctrue individual,\u201d or for the genuine\nencounter between such individuals. Since \u201cthere is no universal\n[of being] whatsoever that subsumes the I and the thou\u201d (NKZ VI,\n381), the locus of genuine interpersonal encounter must be thought of\nin terms of the place of absolute nothingness (see Davis 2014).\n\nIt should be pointed out that the Japanese term for\n\u201cabsolute,\u201d zettai, literally means a\n\u201csevering of opposition,\u201d which implies the sense of\n\u201cwithout an opposing other.\u201d The contrasting term is\ns\u014dtai, which indicates \u201crelativity\u201d in the\nliteral sense of \u201cmutual opposition.\u201d The true absolute\nmust embrace, rather than stand over against, the relative. The\nabsolute, therefore, must not oppose itself to relative beings;\nrather, its self-determination must be such as to allow their mutually\nautonomous relations to take place. According to Nishida, it is only a\nphilosophy of the place of absolute nothingness that can do justice to\nthe notion of the absolute as well as account for both the autonomy\nand the mutual relativity of individuals.\n\nWhile on the one hand Nishida becomes increasingly concerned with\nallowing for radical interpersonal alterity within the place of\nabsolute nothingness, on the other hand he also consistently argues\nfrom early on that \u201cconsciousness\u201d should not be thought\nto entail an unbridgeable epistemological subject-object split.\nAlthough he initially adopted, and adapted, the notion of \u201cpure\nexperience\u201d from William James and others to express this\nnondual basis of knowledge (see Nishida 1990), Nishida later drops\nthis expression in favor of the notion of \u201cself-awareness\u201d\n(jikaku). According to Nishida, self-awareness can be defined\nas a \u201cself reflecting itself within itself\u201d (NKZ IV,\n 215).[12]\n Since absolute nothingness is not a \u201cself\u201d in the sense\nof a subject standing over against an object, any more than it is an\nego with its own interested categories of perception, the\nself-awareness of absolute nothingness must be that of a \u201cseeing\nwithout a seer\u201d or a \u201cknowing without a knower.\u201d\n\u201cSince there is no-thing that reflects, it is like a mirror\nreflecting the mirror itself\u201d (ibid., 181).\n\nIn Nishida\u2019s middle period, the paradigm for knowing is a\n\u201cpure seeing\u201d (tada miru) beyond all acting and\nvolition. Nishida claims that as finite individuals we can approach\nthis ideal by way of thoroughly negating or emptying the ego.\n\u201cBy truly emptying the self, the field of consciousness can\nreflect an object just as it is\u201d (NKZ IV, 221). The self reaches\nthe place of absolute nothingness, and therefore first truly comes\ninto contact with other beings, by way of thoroughly emptying itself\nin a movement of \u201cimmanent transcendence\u201d that takes it\nback through the depths of the field of consciousness.\n\nIn his last completed text, \u201cThe Logic of Place and the\nReligious Worldview,\u201d Nishida most fully develops the religious\nimplications of the idea of absolute nothingness. There he suggests\nthat absolute nothingness is the best way to understand God or the\nabsolute, which he defines as that which \u201ccontains its own\nabsolute self-negation within itself\u201d (NKZ XI, 397). As absolute\nnothingness, God is the dynamic principle of affirmation by way of\nabsolute self-negation. The true absolute essentially negates its\ntranscendent divinity and expresses itself in the forms of the\n relative.[13]\n\nNishida insists that this idea of God can be understood no more in\nterms of an immanent pantheism than in terms of a transcendent theism.\nIt may perhaps best be called \u201cpanentheism\u201d; but for\nNishida this too remains a static term of \u201cobjective\nlogic\u201d and fails to capture the necessity of thinking God as\nboth irreducibly transcendent and thoroughly immanent. As\nNishida is fond of saying, God or the Buddha is \u201cimmanently\ntranscendent.\u201d It is the paradoxical logic one finds in the\nPraj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 Sutras of\nMah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism (i.e., what D. T. Suzuki called the\n\u201clogic of soku-hi,\u201d a logic of \u201cis and is\nnot\u201d) that Nishida thinks most profoundly expresses the\n\u201cabsolute dialectic\u201d of the divine as the dynamic\nprinciple of absolute nothingness (NKZ XI, 399; see Nishida 1987,\n69\u201371).\n\nIf we as finite relative beings can and do touch the infinite\nabsolute, it is only by way of a mutual self-negation. Nishida calls\nthis mutual self-negation \u201cinverse correspondence\u201d\n(gyakutai\u014d). By way of radically emptying ourselves, we\ncan touch that which is the radical origin of self-emptying, the\nabsolute as an essentially self-negating absolute nothingness.\nAccording to Nishida, an immanent principle of self-negation is, in\nfact, the very essence of life. \u201cTrue life (seimei)\nmust contain within itself an absolute nothingness, a [principle of]\nabsolute negation\u201d (NKZ VIII, 341). It is such a life that can\ntruly be self-determining as a \u201ccreative element of a creative\nworld.\u201d\n\nIn his middle period, inaugurated by the first formulations of the\nidea of \u201cthe place of absolute nothingness\u201d in From\nThat Which Acts to That Which Sees, Nishida\u2019s thought was\ncharacterized by a shift from his earlier voluntarism to a kind of\nintuitionism of pure seeing without a seer (see NKZ IV, 3\u20136). In\nhis later period, however, Nishida\u2019s epistemology became much\nmore dynamic and dialectical; rather than \u201cpure seeing,\u201d\nhis key epistemological phrase then became\n\u201caction-intuition\u201d (k\u014di-teki chokkan).\nAlthough self-emptying still plays a vital role, this is understood\nnot as preparation for a passive intuition, but rather as an active\nprocess of \u201cseeing a thing by becoming it.\u201d In other\nwords, intuition happens only in the midst of the dialectical process\nof acting upon and in turn being acted upon by things.\n\nIn his later period, the place of absolute nothingness is accordingly\nreconceived much more dynamically as the \u201cself-determination of\nthe dialectical world,\u201d a world which continually moves\naccording to the principle of \u201cfrom created to creating.\u201d\nThe absolute finds expression only in the midst of the mutual\ninteraction of individuals and things, and true individuals are both\ndetermined by and \u201ccounter-determine\u201d (gyaku-gentei\nsuru) the movement of the dialectical world (see NKZ VII, 305ff.;\nVIII, 313\u201314). Although one can trace an immanent unfolding of\nNishida\u2019s thought in this direction, it is also clear that a\nmajor impetus for his dialectical development of the idea of absolute\nnothingness can be found in the criticism he received from his junior\ncolleague, Tanabe Hajime.\n",
