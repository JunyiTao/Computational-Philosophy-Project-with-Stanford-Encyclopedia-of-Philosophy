    "main_text": "What Is Collective about Collective Intentionality?\n3. What Is Collective about Collective Intentionality?\n\nA common starting point of the theory of intentionality can be\nrendered as follows: (1) intentionality is taken to be a feature of\nminds, (2) minds are to be conceived as individual minds (or minds of\nindividuals), and (3) each individual has his or her own\nmind. We call this third statement, which is most relevant to the\ntopic at hand, the Individual Ownership Thesis. But how can\nintentional attitudes be shared in more than a merely\ndistributive sense? Or how can what we call the Irreducibility Claim\nbe true? In meeting the challenge of making irreducibility compatible\nwith individual ownership, a lot depends on where exactly the\ncollectivity is placed in the analysis of collective\nintentionality.\n\nIntentionality is commonly divided into three constitutive features.\nFirst, intentionality has content. The content of an\nintentional attitude is whatever the attitude in question is\nabout (e.g., the content of the intention to visit the Taj\nMahal is to visit the Taj Mahal). Second, intentionality has\na mode. The mode is what distinguishes a case of fear from a\ncase of intention, or a belief from a desire. Basic modes are the\nmodes of conative or practical intentional attitudes (such as\nintentions or desires), cognitive or theoretical intentional attitudes\n(such as beliefs or perceptions), and affective or emotional attitudes\n(such as hopes and fears). And third, intentionality has a\nsubject, that is, an entity whose intentionality it is, and\nto whom it can be ascribed as its source or bearer.\n\nWhereas there is a widely shared consensus among the participants in\nthe debate that there is no straightforward reduction of collective\nintentional attitudes to a set of individual intentional attitudes,\nthe question of what exactly is collective about collective\nintentionality is highly controversial. Each of the three components\nof intentional attitudes has been quoted as the seat or locus of the\nsharedness or collectivity in question. Some authors claim that\ncollective intentionality is intentionality with a collective\ncontent, others seem to invoke a special mode, while\nstill others claim that what\u2019s collective about collective\nintentionality has to be the subject. Content-accounts claim that for\nA and B\u2019s intention to visit the Taj Mahal\ntomorrow to be collective, each A and B have to intend\nto visit the Taj Mahal together. Mode-accounts insist that\nthe element of collectivity has to extend to the intending; in their\nview, A and B have to intend collectively to\nvisit the Taj Mahal (together). Subject-accounts hold that the element\nof togetherness is really in the subject; in their view, A and\nB have to form a plural subject or a unified group that is the\nsubject of\u2014and has\u2014the intention to visit the Taj\nMahal.\n\nThe paradigm of collective intentionality in the recent debate is\njoint intention (collective practical intentionality).\nAnalyses of joint intention will thus serve as a common reference\npoint in the following discussion of content-, mode-, and\nsubject-accounts of collective intentionality.\n",
