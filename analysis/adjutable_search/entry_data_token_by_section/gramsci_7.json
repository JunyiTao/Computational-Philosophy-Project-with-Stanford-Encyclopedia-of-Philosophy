    "main_text": "Pre-Prison Journalism and Political Writings || The Factory State\n2.2 The Factory State\n\nThe first original initiative for which Gramsci became known was his\ntheory of factory-based democracy, which he promoted during the\nso-called biennio rosso\u2014or \u201ctwo red\nyears\u201d\u2014of 1919\u20131920.\n\nInspired by the industrial unrest and factory occupations in Turin and\nbeyond, as well as by the new \u201csoviets\u201d in Russia, Gramsci\npublished in Ordine Nuovo various opinions and resources on\nthe topic of a nascent workers\u2019 state (see SPWI: 65\u2013124).\nHis contributions took his earlier humanism in a more concrete,\npractical direction. Efforts by workers to wrest the management of\nproduction from industrialists\u2014in part via \u201cfactory\ncouncils\u201d, formerly grievance committees\u2014instantiated, for\nhim, an initiative rooted in actual history, where a new moral\ncommunity was \u201cspontaneously\u201d expressing its own\nindependent identity beyond the limits of trade unionism. Focused on\nthe practical planning and control of material production, he claimed,\nthe occupying workers were not responding passively to abstract\nhistorical laws or to the directions of their leaders but, rather,\nacting as agents of their own self-creation.\n\nGramsci sketched a model of industrial democracy in which a new type\nof state, based inside the factories, would replace the discredited\nparliamentary regime. Free trade capitalism was exhausted, and trade\nunion organization had now reached its limit, he argued. Emerging\norganically inside the factories were\n\n\ninstitutions which will replace the person of the capitalist in his\nadministrative functions and his industrial power, and so achieve the\nautonomy of the producer in the factory. (SPWI: 77)\n\n\nRather than administer over isolated citizens by separating public\nauthority from everyday life\u2014as under liberalism\u2014the\nfactory instantiated a new type of polity formed around the collective\nmaterial needs of production (see Schecter 1991). Gramsci envisaged a\nparticipatory system of factory councils functioning in a hierarchical\ndemocratic system through which workers would relay and manage the\npractical needs of national life. Authority would be reconciled to\nliberty, not opposed to it, as under liberalism. The atomistic\nindividual would give way to the \u201cproducer\u201d, an individual\nalready psychologically and organizationally oriented to the\ncollective through its role in the labor process (SPWI:\n110\u201311).\n\nGramsci envisaged a system in which a communal identity had priority\nover individual initiative. His was an \u201corganic\u201d model of\nstate in which all parts related to the primary needs of the whole.\nThis was a potentially illiberal system that assumed substantive moral\nagreement among workers (see Sbarberi 1986). Some see here the\ninfluence of the neo-idealist (and soon fascist) philosopher, Giovanni\nGentile. His radical philosophy of \u201cactualism\u201d\u2014in\nwhich the subject\u2019s inner conscience creates its own unified\nworld and community\u2014supported the idea of the \u201cethical\nstate\u201d (stato etico) in which public authority and\nindividual freedom, coercion and consent, were essentially\nindistinguishable (Gentile 1919; see also Schecter 1990). Such\nanti-liberal sentiments were common in the wake of the war and chimed\nwith widespread public disenchantment with elite-led parliamentary\npolitics.\n",
