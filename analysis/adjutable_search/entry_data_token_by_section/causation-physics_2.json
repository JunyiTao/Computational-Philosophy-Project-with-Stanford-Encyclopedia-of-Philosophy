    "main_text": "(Neo)-Russellian Challenges\n2. (Neo)-Russellian Challenges\n\nSeveral of the most widely-discussed arguments aimed at establishing\nthat there is no legitimate place for causal notions in physics can be\ntraced to the writings of Ernst Mach (1900, 1905) and to Bertrand\nRussell\u2019s extremely influential article \u201cOn the Notion of\nCause\u201d (1912). Russell\u2019s target is the notion of cause in\ngeneral, even though some of his arguments appeal to purported\nfeatures of physical theorizing. Mach\u2019s arguments focus more\ndirectly on physics, arguing that there is something distinct about\nphysics that makes it especially inhospitable to causal notions.\nContemporary defenders of neo-Machian and neo-Russellian arguments\ninclude Huw Price (1997; Price & Weslake 2009), Hartry Field\n(2003), John Earman (2011), and, to some extent, John Norton (2003;\n2007;\n 2009).[3]\n\nNeo-Machian and neo-Russellian arguments have a common structure. They\npoint to some putative conceptual feature of causal relations and then\nargue that suitably fundamental theories of physics are incapable of\ngrounding or incorporating these features (Ney 2016). The following\nfive arguments have been particularly influential:\n\nThe notions of cause and effect are inherently vague in\ncontradistinction to the mathematical precision characteristic of\ntheories in physics. This is the vagueness challenge.\nCausal notions can, if at all, only be legitimately employed in\ncontexts in which we can isolate a small set of factors of interest as\nthose responsible for the occurrence of an event\u2014the dominant\ncause or causes\u2014by drawing a distinction between causes and\nbackground conditions. Yet such a distinction, it is argued, cannot be\ndrawn in physics. Call this the dominant cause\nchallenge.\nCauses necessitate their effects, but the fundamental laws of\nphysics are non-deterministic. This is the determinism\nchallenge.\nCausal relations are relations among spatio-temporally localized\nevents, yet fundamental physical laws relate entire global\ntime-slices. Call this the locality challenge.\nThe notion of cause is generally taken to be temporally\nasymmetric: effects never precede their causes. Yet, it is often\nargued that the dynamical laws of the fundamental or established\ntheories of physics are time-symmetric and have the same character in\nboth temporal directions. This is the time-asymmetry\nchallenge.\n\n",
