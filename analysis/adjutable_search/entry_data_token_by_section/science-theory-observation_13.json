    "main_text": "The epistemic value of empirical evidence || Empirical adequacy\n4.3 Empirical adequacy\n\nOn van Fraassen\u2019s (1980) semantic account, a theory is\nempirically adequate when the empirical structure of at least one\nmodel of that theory is isomorphic to what he calls the\n\u201cappearances\u201d (45). In other words, when the theory\n\u201chas at least one model that all the actual phenomena fit\ninside\u201d (12). Thus, for van Fraassen, we continually check the\nempirical adequacy of our theories by seeing if they have the\nstructural resources to accommodate new observations. We\u2019ll\nnever know that a given theory is totally empirically adequate, since\nfor van Fraassen, empirical adequacy obtains with respect to all that\nis observable in principle to creatures like us, not all that has\nalready been observed (69).\n\nThe primary appeal of dealing in empirical adequacy rather than\nconfirmation is its appropriate epistemic humility. Instead of\nclaiming that confirming evidence justifies belief (or boosted\nconfidence) that a theory is true, one is restricted to saying that\nthe theory continues to be consistent with the evidence as far as we\ncan tell so far. However, if the epistemic utility of empirical\nresults in appraising the status of theories is just to judge their\nempirical adequacy, then it may be difficult to account for the\ndifference between adequate but unrealistic theories, and those\nequally adequate theories that ought to be taken seriously as\nrepresentations. Appealing to extra-empirical virtues like parsimony\nmay be a way out, but one that will not appeal to philosophers\nskeptical of the connection thereby supposed between such virtues and\nrepresentational fidelity.\n",
