    "main_text": "The Epistemic Condition || Kinds of Awareness\n1.2 Kinds of Awareness\n\nIn the previous section we identified several plausible epistemic\nrequirements on moral responsibility. They constitute the\ncontent of the awareness that, at least initially, seems to\nbe demanded by the EC. Now we\u2019ll focus on the kind of\nawareness that is in question. We\u2019ll pursue two questions.\nFirst, what mental states must the agent entertain in order\nto possess the relevant awareness? Second, how must the\nmental states in question be entertained (occurrently,\ndispositionally, etc.)?\n\nLet\u2019s begin with the first question. It was pointed out at the\noutset that one of the alternative labels for the EC is\n\u2018knowledge condition\u2019 and this may naturally suggest that\nawareness in this context is nothing but knowledge. Returning to the\nexample, this would mean that John satisfies the EC just in case he\nknew what he was doing and knew about its moral\nsignificance, its potential consequences, etc. However, many\nphilosophers have argued that knowledge proper isn\u2019t required\nfor blameworthiness (Rosen 2008: 596; Haji 2008: 90; Peels 2014:\n493\u20134; Baron 2017: 58\u20139). To see why, consider this case\npresented by Rosen:\n\n\nDorfman poisons Mrs. Dorfman by putting what he takes to be arsenic in\nher tea. The stuff is indeed arsenic and Mrs. Dorfman dies as planned.\nBut Dorfman does not know that the stuff is arsenic (or that\nhis act subjects his victim to an unjustifiable risk of death)\nbecause: The chemist who sold Dorfman the arsenic is a famous liar\n\u2026 [G]iven the chemist\u2019s well-known track record of\nselling sugar as arsenic to would-be poisoners, Dorfman had no\nbusiness believing him. Dorfman\u2019s pertinent beliefs are true,\nbut they do not amount to knowledge because they are based on\ninsufficient evidence. (Rosen 2008: 596)\n\n\nThe key point is that Dorfman\u2019s lack of knowledge about the\nwrong-making features of his action is irrelevant for assessing his\nblameworthiness, for he is as blameworthy as he would be had he knew\nthat the stuff was indeed arsenic. Therefore, whatever mental state\nDorfman was in at the time of carrying out his plan, it must suffice\nfor satisfying the EC. It\u2019s natural to think that the relevant\nmental state is simply true belief (Peels 2014: 493). Dorfman truly\nbelieved that he was pouring arsenic into her wife\u2019s tea and\nthat by doing so she would die, and this seems enough for him to be\nblameworthy (assuming he also satisfied other non-epistemic conditions\non responsibility). Some philosophers think that mere true belief\nisn\u2019t enough, though, and claim that what is needed for\nsatisfying the EC is reasonable or justified belief\ninstead (Timpe 2011: 18; Ginet 2000: 270). This would entail that\nDorfman satisfies the EC only if it was reasonable for him to believe,\nor if he was justified in believing, that what the chemist handed over\nto him was indeed arsenic and thus that he would poison his wife by\npouring the substance in her tea (perhaps it was reasonable and\njustified if Dorfman had never heard about the chemist\u2019s\nreputation as a liar).\n\nHowever, still other philosophers think that not only the belief in\nquestion needn\u2019t be reasonable, but that it needn\u2019t even\nbe true (Zimmerman 2008: 198; Haji 1997: 526; Levy 2014: 36).\nOn this view,\n\n\nblameworthiness is affiliated not with the objective wrongness of an\naction but with whether a person takes herself to be doing wrong in\nperforming an action. (Haji 1997: 526)\n\n\nThis entails that an agent can be blameworthy for performing a morally\nneutral, or even a morally right action (Zimmerman 2008: 201),\nprovided that she acts on the belief that her action is wrong (see the\ncase of Huckleberry Finn in\n sect. 3.3\n below). In defense of this position, it has been argued that there is\na particular kind of culpability that one incurs when one knowingly\ndefies what one takes to be the requirements of morality (Levy 2011:\n142; Zimmerman 2017: 91), regardless of whether one gets them\nright.\n\nAssuming that awareness involves some or another type of belief,\nlet\u2019s turn now to the second question broached above, namely\nhow these beliefs must be entertained for the person to\npossess the relevant awareness. The main dispute here is between those\nphilosophers who think that the pertinent beliefs must be\noccurrently entertained (Zimmerman 1997: 421\u20132; 2017:\n79; Ginet 2000: 270; Rosen 2004: 309; Levy 2011: 141) and those who\nthink that it\u2019s enough if these beliefs are\ndispositionally entertained (Haji 1997: 531; Peels 2011: 580;\nTimpe 2011: 18; Levy 2013: 167; 2014:\n 34).[3]\n According to the \u2018occurrentist\u2019 camp, an agent satisfies\nthe EC only if, at the time of action, she consciously believes that\nher action is right/wrong and consciously contemplates some of its\npossible consequences (Zimmerman 1997: 421). Otherwise, and for the\npurposes of attributions of responsibility, she is ignorant of\nrelevant considerations and so, in principle (recall the possibility\nof culpable ignorance), she has an excuse for her wrongdoing\n(Zimmerman 2017: 79; see\n sect. 3.1\n below for an argument in favor of this position). As we\u2019ll see\nbelow\n (sect. 2),\n the occurrentist interpretation of the EC plays a central role in a\nrevisionist argument against commonsense attributions of\nresponsibility.\n\nBy contrast, the \u2018dispositionalist\u2019 camp argues that the\noccurrentist interpretation of the EC is too strict and would let too\nmany intuitively blameworthy wrongdoers off the hook. For one, if one\nforgets a relevant piece of information and as a consequence does\nsomething wrong\u2014if, say, one forgets about the dietary\nrestrictions of the infant one is babysitting and then feeds her food\nto which she is allergic\u2014one seems to be, absent excusing\nconditions, blameworthy (Peels 2011: 580; see also Husak 2011).\nCrucially, however, lack of occurrent belief concerning the relevant\ninformation doesn\u2019t seem to be one of those excusing conditions\n(Amaya & Doris 2015: 267). Also, if the occurrentist position were\nright, one could shield oneself from blame simply by avoid thinking\nabout the moral status of one\u2019s action, and that\u2019s\nimplausible (Guerrero 2007: 74; Timpe 2011: 23; Robichaud 2014: 150;\nLevy 2014: 31). These considerations lead to the position that tacit,\ndormant, dispositional, or unconscious beliefs can, at least in many\ncases, amount to the kind of awareness that is required for moral\nresponsibility (see\n sect. 3.1\n below for more arguments in favor of this position).\n",
