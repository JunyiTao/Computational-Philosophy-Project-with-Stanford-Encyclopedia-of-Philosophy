    "main_text": "Challenges and Replies || The Generality Problem\n2.3 The Generality Problem\n\nPerhaps the most widely discussed problem for process reliabilism is\nthe generality problem. Originally anticipated by Goldman in\n\u201cWhat Is Justified Belief?\u201d, it has been pressed more\nsystematically by Feldman (1985) and Conee and Feldman (1998). Any\nparticular belief is the product of a token causal process in the\nsubject\u2019s mind/brain, which occurs at a particular time and\nplace. Such a process token can be \u201ctyped\u201d, however, in\nmany broader or narrower ways. Each type will have its own associated\nlevel of reliability, often distinct from the levels of reliability of\nother types it instantiates. Which repeatable type should be selected\nfor purposes of assigning a reliability number to the process token?\nIf no (unique) type can be selected, what establishes the\njustificatory status of the resulting belief?\n\nConsider a concrete example (Conee & Feldman 1998): Smith sees a\nmaple tree outside his window one sunny afternoon and forms the belief\nthat there is a maple tree near his house. How should we type his\nbelief-forming process? Is the relevant type vision? Or\nperhaps something more fine-grained, such as visual experience of\na maple tree on a sunny afternoon? Or is it something more\ncoarse-grained, such as perception? The worry is that\nSmith\u2019s token belief-forming process seems to instantiate all\nthese process types (and many more). So singling out any single one of\nthem as the \u201cright\u201d way of typing the process seems\narbitrary.\n\nReliabilists have proposed various strategies for dealing with the\ngenerality problem. Some of the main responses include:\nPsychological Approaches (Alston 1995; Beebe 2004; Kampa 2018; Lyons 2019)\n\nNot every way of describing a belief-forming process carves\npsychological reality at its joints. Consider, for example, the\nprocess type, forming a perceptual belief while wearing green\nsocks. Intuitively, this is an \u201cinappropriate\u201d or\n\u201cirrelevant\u201d way of describing Smith\u2019s\nbelief-forming process. But why is it inappropriate? According to\npsychological approaches, it is inappropriate because it mentions\nfeatures of Smith\u2019s circumstances that play no causal role in\nthe psychological processes responsible for his belief.\n\nIn their 1998 discussion of the generality problem, Conee and Feldman\nacknowledge that turning to psychology will help winnow down the\nnumber of eligible process types. But they express skepticism that it\nwill always yield a unique process type. Why won\u2019t there be\nmultiple psychologically \u201creal\u201d process types responsible\nfor a given belief token? Subsequent developments of the psychological\napproach have tried to address this worry. For example, Beebe (2004)\nproposes that the relevant process type will always be an\ninformation-processing procedure or algorithm. Of course, there will\noften be indefinitely many types of this kind, of varying reliability.\nTo pick out the appropriate type, Beebe offers the following\ninstructions. Let A be the broadest such type. Choose a\npartition that is the broadest objectively homogeneous subclass of\nA within which the token process falls, where a class is\nobjectively homogeneous if no statistically relevant partition of it\ncan be effected. Beebe\u2019s proposal has been challenged by Dutant\nand Olsson (2013), who argue that it faces a dilemma: either it does\nnot always yield a unique process type or it leads to trivialization\nby collapsing reliability into truth. For a more recent variant of\nBeebe\u2019s solution, aimed at addressing Dutant and Olsson\u2019s\nconcerns, see Kampa (2018).\n\nPerhaps the most fully developed version of a psychological approach\nto the generality problem comes from Lyons (2019). Lyons agrees with\nBeebe that the relevant psychological process types are\ninformation-processing algorithms. But Lyons additionally suggests\nthat these algorithms need to be relativized to parameters,\nunderstood as psychological variables that affect processing in a\nlaw-like way. For example, lighting conditions are a\nparameter that affects the speed and accuracy of visual information\nprocessing. As Lyons develops this view, the appropriate process type\nfor a given belief token B is provided by the complete\nalgorithmic specification of every psychological process that is\ncausally relevant to B, along with the parameter values for all\nof these processes. As Lyons notes, one upshot of this approach is\nthat the relevant process types will typically be very fine-grained.\nSmith\u2019s belief-forming process type will not be vision,\nbut something more like: visual recognition of objects based on\nretinal stimulus of sort S, in lighting conditions C,\nwith attention distributed in manner M.\nParrying Responses (Comesa\u00f1a 2006; Bishop 2010; Tolly 2017)\n\nA different approach to the generality problem is to insist that a\nversion of the problem arises for any adequate epistemology, not just\nreliabilists. A version of this \u201cparrying response\u201d has\nbeen developed by Juan Comesa\u00f1a (2006), who argues that every\naccount of doxastic justification needs to appeal to the basing\nrelation. This is true even of evidentialist accounts: after all,\nevidentialists maintain that in order for a belief B to be\ndoxastically justified, B needs to be based on a body of\nevidence that supports B. (More on evidentialism in\n \u00a74.2\n below.) But, Comesa\u00f1a argues, any attempt to characterize the\nbasing relation will run into the generality problem, or something\nvery similar to it. Moreover, Comesa\u00f1a contends, if\nevidentialists are willing to simply take for granted some notion of\nbasing in their theory, then there is no reason why reliabilists\ncannot follow suit, and deploy the basing relation in their solution\nto the generality problem.\n\nA rather different parrying response has been defended by Michael\nBishop (2010), who argues that the problem will arise for any theory\nthat allows for the possibility of \u201creflective\njustification\u201d\u2014that is, having a belief B that is\njustified on the basis of one\u2019s knowledge that one formed\nB via a reliable form of reasoning. For further discussion, see\nMatheson (2015) and Tolly (2017).\n\nBoth Comesa\u00f1a and Bishop focus on the idea that all\nepistemologists face a version of the generality problem. A\nrelated but distinct idea is to insist that versions of the generality\nproblem crop up everywhere, not just in epistemology. This response\nhas been developed recently by Goldman (forthcoming), who points out\nthat we regularly evaluate the reliability of all sorts of processes,\nnot all of them cognitive. Goldman illustrates with the example of\nGeraldine, who enjoys shooting hoops at her local gym.\nGeraldine\u2019s performance is a function of many factors, including\nhow she focuses her eyes on the target hoop, how she grips the ball,\nhow she selects an angle to hit the backboard, etc. Now consider\nGeraldine\u2019s friend, Henry, who watches as Geraldine consistently\nsinks more than 80% of her shots, using roughly the technique each\ntime. Henry may not be able to provide a detailed specification of\nGeraldine\u2019s hoop-shooting process. Nonetheless, it seems he is\nin a position to conclude that Geraldine uses some process\ntype that is responsible for her frequent attainment of her athletic\ngoal, and that this process is fairly reliable.\n\nGoldman (forthcoming) argues that these considerations carry two\nlessons. First, they show that the generality problem is very general,\nsince some version of it arises in non-epistemic contexts. Second,\nGoldman takes these considerations to cast doubt on the common\nassumption\u2014voiced explicitly by Conee and Feldman (1998:\n2\u20133)\u2014that an adequate solution to the generality problem\nwill need to specify a unique process type responsible for any and\nevery token belief. According to Goldman, an evaluator can correctly\n(and justifiably) describe a process as reliable, without being able\nto specify in any detail the sort of process type at issue.\n\u201cCommon Sense\u201d Typing Approaches (Goldman 1979; J\u00f6nsson 2013; Olsson 2016)\n\nYet another strategy is to switch tack and inquire into how ordinary\npeople type belief-forming processes. Suppose we ask a person on the\nstreet, \u201cHow did Smith form his belief?\u201d Chances are,\nthey\u2019ll answer \u201cvision\u201d, not \u201cvisual\nexperience of a maple tree on a Tuesday afternoon while\nwearing\u2026\u201d Inspired by this observation, common sense\napproaches seek to solve the generality problem in two steps. Step\nOne: develop a psychological theory of how ordinary people type\nbelief-forming processes. Step Two: Use these \u201ccommon\nsense\u201d typing methods to winnow down the range of candidate\nprocess types.\n\nA version of this approach has been elaborated by Erik Olsson (2016),\nwho appeals to a well-supported psychological theory about\nconceptualization called basic-level theory, developed by\nEleanor Rosch in the 1970s (Rosch et al. 1976). Rosch and her\ncollaborators studied the deployment of taxonomically related concepts\nlike \u201canimal\u201d, \u201cdog\u201d, and\n\u201clabrador\u201d. In such a taxonomy, one term is a\nsuperordinate concept (\u201canimal\u201d), another is an\nintermediate-level concept (\u201cdog\u201d), and a third is a\nsubordinate concept (\u201clabrador\u201d). It turns out that\nintermediate-level concepts are overwhelmingly preferred in free\nnaming tasks (e.g., \u201cWhat would you call this?\u201d). For\nexample, in one study Rosch et al. found that, out of 540 responses,\n530 to 533 converged on the same intermediate-level word for naming a\nphysical object. Olsson suggests that ordinary people might similarly\ntend to converge on an intermediate-level concept when typing\nbelief-forming processes. This conjecture has been empirically\nsupported in work by J\u00f6nsson (2013). J\u00f6nsson showed subjects\nclips in which characters arrived at various conclusions, and then\nasked the subjects to specify how the characters arrived at their\nbeliefs. Subjects converged on the choice of verbs describing the\nbelief-formation processes, even without linguistic cues to guide the\nprocess-typing task. J\u00f6nsson also found a correlation between\nsubjects\u2019 estimates of the reliability of the characters\u2019\nbelief-forming processes and subjects\u2019 judgments about whether\nthe characters were justified in holding the beliefs in question. Thus\nthere is some evidence that folk psychological propensities lead us to\nconverge on belief-typing tasks, and that our reliability assessments\ntrack our justification judgments.\n",
