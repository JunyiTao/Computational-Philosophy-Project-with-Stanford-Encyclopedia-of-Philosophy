    "main_text": "Causal Theories of the Basing Relation\n1. Causal Theories of the Basing Relation\n\nCausal theories of the basing relation hold that for a belief to be\nbased on a reason, the reason must cause the belief in an appropriate\nway. Causal theories of the basing relation must not be confused with\ncausal theories of knowledge or justification. One might take a causal\ntheory of the basing relation to explain how one has taken into\naccount the reasons one possesses when forming or evaluating a belief,\nregardless of whether the reason actually contributes to the\njustification of the belief. Also, one might hold that a\nbelief\u2019s being justified requires not only being based on a good\nreason, but also requires, e.g., the fulfillment of various epistemic\nduties, coherence within an appropriate cognitive system, etc.\n\nPaul Moser offers the following example of a causal theory of the\nbasing relation for propositional reasons (Moser, 1989, p. 157):\n\nS\u2019s believing or assenting to P is based on\nhis justifying propositional reason Q =df\nS\u2019s believing or assenting to P is causally\nsustained in a nondeviant manner by his believing or assenting to\nQ, and by his associating P and Q.\n\n\nMoser limits this account of the basing relation to instances of\ninferential knowledge, unlike the more general characterization of the\nbasing relation given above.\n\nA belief is causally sustained by a reason when the reason maintains\nthe belief, much like a rope might sustain the height and position of\na hanging plant. On Moser\u2019s account, the belief must be causally\nsustained in a nondeviant manner by both the believing of or assenting\nto Q and by the association of P and Q.\n\nMoser defines the appropriate occurrent association relation as\nfollows (Moser 1989, pp. 141\u2013142):\n\nS occurrently satisfies an association relation between\nE and P =df (i) S has a de\nre awareness of E\u2019s supporting P, and\n(ii) as a nondeviant result of this awareness, S is in a\ndispositional state whereby if he were to focus his attention only on\nhis evidence for P (while all else remained the same), he\nwould focus his attention on E.\n\n\nThe association relation may also be non-occurrent and the belief\nstill justified by the reason in question. In this case, condition (i)\nwill have been satisfied in the past and the dispositional state\ndescribed in condition (ii) will still be present. The \u201cde\nre awareness\u201d is a non-propositional, direct awareness of\nE\u2019s supporting P. This is the sort of\nawareness one might have of being thirsty or cold before thinking\n\u201cI\u2019m thirsty\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m cold\u201d. This\nawareness is non-propositional in that you need not put it into words\nin order to have it, and it is direct in the sense that no sensation\nstate (mental image, sense datum) need come between being thirsty and\nbeing aware of one\u2019s thirst. By contrast, some have held that,\nfor example, our awareness that there is a table in the room is\nindirect in that it is mediated by a sensation state (mental image,\nsense-datum) which represents the table.\n\nIn addition to Moser\u2019s theory, there are a variety of other\npossible causal theories of the basing relation which might be\nproposed. For example, one might eliminate the association condition,\nrequiring only that the reason cause the belief in some appropriate\nway. One motivation for such a theory might be the view that one need\nnot be aware of a reason for it to be the basis of a belief, as in the\ncase of subliminal reasons. One issue here would be whether such\nsubconscious states can be justifying reasons. Alternatively, one\nmight hold that the reason need not sustain the belief, but only have\ncaused the belief to come into existence. One motivation for such a\nview might be that one may justifiably believe things on the basis of\nreasons one has forgotten (Goldman 2001, pp. 214\u2013216). For\nexample, most people cannot remember on what basis they came to\nbelieve that tigers are native to Asia, but it seems obvious that such\npeople are still justified in believing this. In such cases, the\nreason no longer sustains the belief\u2014in fact, the reason is no\nlonger possessed. Nonetheless, it might be argued, one\u2019s belief\nthat tigers are native to Asia is still based on the reason which\noriginally caused it. On the other hand, one consideration against\nthis view is the intuition that a belief cannot be justified if one\npossesses no reason for it. In addition, it may be argued that there\nare other ways of accounting for how a belief may be justified even if\nthe original reason for it has been forgotten. For instance, one might\nreason as follows: \u201cI can\u2019t recall where I first learned\nthis, but I feel sure it is true, and such feelings have proved to be\nreliable in the past. Hence, my belief that tigers are native to Asia\nis probably true.\u201d\n\nA variety of objections have been raised against causal theories of\nthe basing relation\n generally.[2]\n The most common of these is the problem of deviant causal chains, a\nproblem which plagues causal analyses in general. With regard to the\nbasing relation, the problem is that not every instance of a\nreason\u2019s causing a belief will establish a basing relation.\nAlvin Plantinga illustrates the problem well (Plantinga 1993, p. 69,\nn.8):\n\nSuddenly seeing Sylvia, I form the belief that I see her; as a result,\nI become rattled and drop my cup of tea, scalding my leg. I then form\nthe belief that my leg hurts; but though the former belief is a (part)\ncause of the latter, it is not the case that I accept the latter on\nthe evidential basis of the\n former.[3]\n\n\nWhat makes the problem so difficult is that there are a variety of\nways the causal chain of events can go wrong and thereby fail to\nestablish a basing relation. For example, glitches in the brain,\nwandering thoughts, wishful thinking, strong emotions, etc., may all\nbe implicated in deviant causal chains. It is quite difficult to\nclearly explain what non-deviant causation amounts to, yet without\nsuch an explanation causal theories are ultimately unsatisfactory.\n\nHowever, there have been efforts to modify causal theories to avoid\nthe problem:\n\nAn interesting possible solution to the problem is provided by Kevin\nMcCain (McCain 2012). McCain proposes an interventionist account of\ncausation according to which (roughly) X causes Y if and\nonly if were a change in X to occur, Y would change in a\nregular way (setting aside any other redundant causes of Y).\nMoreover, X is a direct cause of Y if and only if,\nsetting aside all other causally relevant events, a possible\nintervention on X (e.g., to eliminate its causal power) would\nchange Y (e.g., Y would not occur). The basing relation\nthen gets defined as follows:\n\nA person S\u2019s belief that p at time t is\nbased on her reasons R if and only if at t:\n\n\neach ri \u2208 R is a direct cause of\nS\u2019s believing that p, and\neach ri \u2208 R is an actual cause\nof S\u2019s believing that p, and\nIt is not the case that intervening to set the values of all\ndirect causes of S\u2019s believing that p, other than\nthe members of R, to zero will result in S\u2019s not\nbelieving that p when every ri \u2208\nR is held fixed at its actual value.\n (McCain 2012, p. 364)\n\n\nTo set the value of a direct cause to zero is merely to stipulate that\nit is not a cause. Thus, condition (3) ensures that the members of\nR are collectively sufficient to cause S\u2019s belief that\np.\n\nMcCain\u2019s theory offers a quick solution to the problem of\ndeviant causal chains. In Plantinga\u2019s example of Sylvia, for\ninstance, the person\u2019s belief that their leg hurts is based only\non the pain felt in their leg for, on McCain\u2019s theory, neither\nthe becoming rattled nor the belief that the person sees Sylvia are a\ndirect cause of the belief that their leg hurts. This is because\nneither the belief nor the becoming rattled are direct causes of the\nbelief that their leg hurts. (McCain 2012, p. 372) The requirement\nthat a cause be direct in order to be the basis of a belief seems to\nlimit, in cases like these, causes that establish basing relations to\nthe immediately previous link in the causal chain of events. To\noversimplify the point to a slogan, McCain eliminates the problem of\ndeviant causal chains by eliminating the causal chains (from counting\nas bases).\n\nMcCain discusses the potential problem that it might be implausible to\nrequire that basing relations be direct (McCain 2012, p.\n368\u2013369). To use McCain\u2019s example, suppose that Sally\nbelieves that p and that p \u2283 q\n(\u201cp implies q\u201d), and validly infers, and\nthereby comes to believe, that q. She also believes q\n\u2283 t, and validly infers t from her beliefs that\nq and q \u2283 t. On McCain\u2019s theory of the\nbasing relation, since Sally\u2019s beliefs that p and\np \u2283 q are not direct causes of her belief that\nt, her belief that t is not based on those beliefs. In\nother words, on McCain\u2019s theory, the basing relation is not\ntransitive. This raises questions about whether McCain\u2019s theory\nadequately accounts for our pre-theoretical account of the basing\nrelation. In particular, does McCain\u2019s theory correctly identify\none\u2019s reasons for one\u2019s beliefs? McCain replies that,\ngiven his theory, we can still claim that, e.g., Sally\u2019s belief\nthat t is dependent on her beliefs that p and that\np \u2283 q, even if not based on them.\n\nAn alternative kind of causal theory of the basing relation, also\nintended to avoid the problem of deviant causal chains, is proposed by\nRu Ye (Ye 2020) and named Causation Caused by Believing (CCB):\n\n\n(CCB) One\u2019s belief that p is based on a reason R\njust in case R causes the belief and the causation is caused\nby one\u2019s believing that R supports p.\n\n\nPresumably, R need not produce the belief that p,\nbut may instead causally sustain it. Thus, one could acquire the\nbelief that p, and only later base the belief that p\non R. Note that unlike doxastic theories of the basing\nrelation, discussed below, the belief that R supports\np, alone, is not sufficient to establish a basing\nrelation.\n\nIn general, why would a (potential) reason cause one belief rather\nthan another or none at all? A natural answer is that the person\nbelieves something to the effect that the reason is a good reason to\nhold the belief. (CCB) captures this thought quite nicely.\n\nYe argues that (CCB) has considerable explanatory power. In\nparticular, it is said to avoid the problem deviant causal chains.\nConsider Plantinga\u2019s example of Sylvia: your belief that your leg\nhurts, though caused by seeing Sylvia enter the room, is not based on\nit because you lack the belief that seeing Sylvia supports your belief\nthat your leg hurts. It may also help with clarifying the distinction\nbetween triggering causes and structural causes: the latter play a\ndifferent causal role than the former. In the case of (CCB), the\nstructuring causes include the belief to the effect that R is\na good reason to believe that p.\n\nYe goes on to argue that CCB does not over-intellectualize basing (an\nobjection discussed further below, with doxastic theories of the\nbasing relation), putting it beyond the ability of those \u2013 such as\nyoung children \u2013 with very few epistemic concepts because, following\nMoser, the belief about one\u2019s reasons may be de re.\nRegarding those incapable of forming even such a de re\nbelief, Ye argues that such cases are indistinguishable from deviant\ncausal chains.\n\nA third alternative form of causal theory, the Causal-Manifestation\nAccount (CMA) proposed by John Turri, is also aimed at avoiding\nproblems with deviant causal chains (Turri 2011). Turri describes the\naccount as, roughly, this:\n\n\n(CMA): R is among your reasons for believing Q if\nand only if R\u2019s causing your belief manifests (at least\nsome of ) your cognitive traits.\n\n\nA cognitive trait is taken to be a disposition or habit to form (or\nsustain) a doxastic attitude under certain circumstances. These may\ninclude, for example, taking an experience at face value, or reasoning\nin a pattern corresponding to modus ponens, etc. Consider\nPlantinga\u2019s example of Sylvia: seeing Sylvia causes your belief\nthat you are in pain. But the causal relation as a whole between the\ntwo events does not manifest any cognitive traits, such as some sort\nof cognitive inference. Individual links in the chain of events\nbeginning with seeing Sylvia may manifest some cognitive traits, but\nnot the causal relation as a whole.\n\nA second line of objection to causal theories of the basing relation\nin general involves counterexamples raised in Lehrer\n 1971.[4]\n We\u2019ll henceforth call these \u201csuperstitious lawyer\u201d\nexamples, and they go like this. Suppose a series of eight grisly\nmurders has been committed, all the available evidence indicates that\nthe lawyer\u2019s client committed the first seven of those murders,\nand everyone believes that he committed the eighth murder as well.\nHowever, the lawyer, being superstitious, has absolute faith in the\ncards. The cards indicate that his client is innocent of the eighth\nmurder, and the lawyer comes to believe this on the basis of his faith\nin the cards. The lawyer then re-examines the evidence and finds a\nvery complicated line of reasoning showing that his client is innocent\nof the eighth murder. The lawyer recognizes that the complicated line\nof reasoning shows that his client is innocent. However, due to the\ngrisly nature of the case, the lawyer (and everyone else) strongly\ndesires to believe that the murderer of all eight victims has been\nfound. Thus, the lawyer\u2019s belief that the complicated line of\nreasoning is correct lacks the overwhelming emotional conviction\nneeded to overcome the lawyer\u2019s desire, and thus cannot cause\nthe lawyer to believe that his client is innocent of the eighth\nmurder. It is only his unshakable faith in the cards that is\nsufficient to cause the lawyer to believe that his client is innocent.\nNonetheless, since the lawyer takes the line of reasoning seriously,\nit seems reasonable to believe that the complicated line of reasoning\ncould give the lawyer knowledge that his client is innocent.\n\nThe idea behind Lehrer\u2019s example is to conjoin the intuition\nthat the lawyer is justified in believing that his client is innocent\nwith the view that being justified in holding a belief requires that\nthe belief be based on a good reason in order to arrive at the\nconclusion that the lawyer\u2019s belief that his client is innocent\nis based on the complicated line of reasoning.\n\nThe case of the superstitious lawyer is very complicated and\nLehrer\u2019s argument has frequently been criticized. Alvin Goldman,\nfor example, has claimed that \u201c\u2026I find this example\nunconvincing. To the extent that I clearly imagine that the lawyer\nfixes his belief solely as a result of the cards, it seems intuitively\nwrong to say that he knows\u2014or has a justified\nbelief\u2014that his client is innocent.\u201d (Goldman 1979,\np. 22, n.\n 8)[5]\n Goldman does not elaborate on this objection, but the concern is that\nthe lawyer has not taken his good reason into proper account when\nforming his belief that his client is innocent. One way of responding\nto this concern is presented below in the discussion of the\ncausal-doxastic theory of the basing relation.\n",
