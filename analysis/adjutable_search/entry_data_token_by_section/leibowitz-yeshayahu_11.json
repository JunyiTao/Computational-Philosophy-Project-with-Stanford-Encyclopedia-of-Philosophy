    "main_text": "Ethics and Religion || Meta-Halakhah and the Status of Women\n7. Religion, State, and Israel\n\nLeibowitz was an unabashed Zionist. However, Zionism for Leibowitz was\ndefined simply as \u201cthe endeavor to liberate Jews from being\nruled by the Gentiles\u201d (Judaism, 214), an endeavor that\nthe state of Israel \u201ccompletely satisfies.\u201d Thus, despite\nbeing a religious Jew, Leibowitz\u2019s Zionism is avowedly secular,\nand his secular version of Zionism flows directly from the central\ntenets of his philosophy. Firstly, it is dictated by his intentional\napproach to religious action \u2013 the motivation for setting up the\nstate was political and nationalistic rather than religious. Indeed,\nZionism was initially a secular Jewish revolution, a political\nmovement with nationalist aspirations. Secondly, it is directly\nimplied by his view that the service of human needs and interests\ncannot be equated with the service of God. For Leibowitz, the state\nachieves a perfectly noble political purpose, serving human needs. But\nagain this should not be confused with its having religious\nvalue in itself:\n\n\nCounterfeit religion identifies national interests with the\nservice of God and imputes to the state \u2013 which is only an\ninstrument serving human needs \u2013 supreme value from a religious\nstandpoint. (Judaism, 226\u2013227)\n\n\nThus, it would seem as if religion and state cannot possibly be\nlinked, and this indeed was a position that Leibowitz would take. Here\nthough, it seems as if Leibowitz\u2019s thought, or at least his\nattitude towards what constitutes meaningful discourse, underwent\nsignificant development.\n\nIn his earliest writings of the early 1930s, written while still in\nGermany, Leibowitz was aligned with the religious Zionism of the\nMizrachi movement. For Leibowitz, the contraction of the halakhic\nsystem over almost two thousand years of exile had led to its\ndisfigurement. Confined to the private sphere as a result of\nJudaism\u2019s exilic reality over this period, in combination then\n(and now) with the secularization wrought by modernity, the halakhic\nsystem had never had to deal with the challenge of nationhood. With\nthe advent of Zionism, Leibowitz writes \u201cwe are presented with\nthe opportunity and the task of realizing through and within the land\nof Israel the concealed power of Torah\u201d (Ratziti, 327),\nthrough the application, indeed restoration, of the system of Jewish\nlaw to its original nation-building purpose whereby it might produce a\nstate that could run according to Jewish law; that could accommodate,\nfor example, the needs of a country to have a fully working police\nforce and electrical system on the Sabbath without being parasitic on\nJews who do not observe the laws forbidding such action on the\nSabbath. For Leibowitz, \u201ca specific and detailed halakhic code\nfor administering the full panoply of state functions is called for\n\u2026 [to give] a clear picture of how the religious parties would\nrun the state if and when they came to power\u201d (Judaism,\n170\u2013171).\n\nInitially, this \u201crole of enacting new halakhic\nlegislation\u201d was assigned by Leibowitz \u201cto the religious\npublic as a whole\u201d (Torah u-Mitzvot, 73). During this\nearly period, as Moshe Hellinger points out, Leibowitz presents a\n\u201cparticipatory democratic model\u201d (Hellinger, 2008, 257),\nthat yields a radical form of democratic halakhic Judaism. As early as\n1947, however, Leibowitz is noting how \u201cthe sector of the\nreligious public organized as a political movement lacks a religious\nprogram for the conduct of the state\u201d (Judaism, 154),\nleading him instead to look to the religious rabbinic establishment to\ntake the courageous steps necessary to provide a vision for such a\n\u201chalakhic state.\u201d\n\nThis nation-building vision would have necessitated a halakhic\nrevolution, utilizing innovative and creative techniques of Jewish\nlegal interpretation and application. But instead, in\nLeibowitz\u2019s eyes the religious parties prostituted themselves to\nthe state to protect their own brand of religious sectarianism,\nsubordinating religion to the machinery of the secular government.\nLeibowitz\u2019s initial radicalism thus came up against the halakhic\nconservatism of his fellow religious Zionists, which, together with\nwhat he saw as the moral corruption of its rabbinic leadership, led to\nhis disillusionment with religious Zionism, disillusion that was\nfurther exacerbated by the Kibiyeh affair (see Hellinger 2008, 275ff),\nwhich served to reinforce his view regarding the pernicious\nconsequences of \u201capplying the religious category of holiness to\nsocial, national, and political values\u201d (Judaism, 189).\nThus, by 1959, in recognition of this reality, Leibowitz changed his\ntune, presenting a call for the separation of religion and state as\nthe only program \u201cthat would be in the religious interest in the\nexisting situation\u201d (Judaism, 175).\n\nStill, at this point, while reality has bitten, there is no statement\nthat in principle religion and state must remain separate. A\ndecade later, however, Leibowitz seems to espouse such a view, stating\nthat \u201cno state whatsoever, in the past, present, or any\nforeseeable future, in any society, in any era, in any culture,\nincluding the Jewish culture, ever was or will ever be anything but a\nsecular institution\u201d (Judaism, 215\u2013216).\n\nOn the one hand, this should come as no surprise given that politics\nis concerned with human institutions that serve human needs, and\nLeibowitz cannot allow for acts of religious worship that are directed\ntowards human needs. On the other hand, it does clearly represent a\nshift in his thought, from a de facto to a de jure\nrejection of the religious Zionist dream. Nonetheless, in noting that\nthe state \u201csets the ground for the struggle for religion, which\nis by its very nature an eternal struggle that will never end in\nvictory\u201d (Judaism, 215\u2013216), he does appear to\nleave open the possibility of political action having some form of\nreligious import. Indeed, he goes on to say that the reason that\nIsrael has no religious significance is precisely \u201cbecause no\nsuch struggle is being conducted in it\u201d (ibid.), which appears\nto imply the possibility of a state having such significance were it\nto provide for such a struggle, though at this stage the idea that\nthis could eventuate in any form of democratic religious polity has\nbeen replaced by a vision of the state as maximally \u201ca mere\nplatform for struggles in the spirit of liberal ideas that celebrate\nthe neutrality of statehood\u201d (Hellinger, 2008, 279).\n\nIt remains the case then that Judaism qua Judaism cannot, for\nLeibowitz, present any specific form of political organization, since\npolitical acts cannot themselves be halakhic acts. But as mentioned\nearlier, Leibowitz speaks of \u201cconditions necessary for halakhic\nobservance\u201d (Judaism, 4), essential conditions for\nindividuals to worship God that would include human social and\npolitical organization. Politics is the scaffolding without which\nindividuals would not have the capacity to engage in their individual\n\u201creligious struggles,\u201d and this presumably yields the\nlesser category of \u201creligious significance\u201d to the\npolitical state. Given his intentionalism though, mere political\norganization can have no religious significance in itself for\nLeibowitz; presumably, once again, it could only have such\nsignificance if political action is driven by the intention\nthat the state be an enabling condition for religious worship. And\nwhile many modern liberal states do indeed thus enable religious\nworship, this is certainly not their primary intent, and they could\nnot therefore be seen to have any substantive \u201creligious\nsignificance\u201d to speak of.\n\nNone of this is to say that religion cannot be relevant to the state\nin any way, even today. Though he does not wish to speak of how\nreligion can serve the state, since this inverts the correct\nhierarchical relationship between the two, religion can nonetheless\nhave a \u201cfunction\u201d within the state for Leibowitz as a\n\u201ccritical friend\u201d that can \u201ccheck the influence of\npolitical values and \u2026 restrain the patriotism and\nnationalistic enthusiasm\u201d (Judaism, 209\u2013210).\nThus \u201cif religion has a function, it is to place man\u2019s\nlimited values in a true perspective\u201d (Judaism,\n210\u2013211). Indeed, the mistaken religious significance that\npeople do impute either to the land or to the state is nothing short\nof scandalous for Leibowitz, both religiously and morally.\n\nIt seems, therefore, that as time moved on, Leibowitz\u2019s liberal\nand moral leanings prevent him from being willing to engage in what is\nultimately utopian speculation concerning a halakhic vision for the\nstate. The earlier program is a mere pipedream when the state is\ncatering to a nation that has no interest in Jewish observance, and\ncould thus only become a halakhic state through the totalitarian\nimposition of religious observance. Were the entire population\nunanimously in favor of such observance, Leibowitz might once again\ntake up the cause, though given the freedom of thought that could lead\nthat population to then change its mind, this seems unlikely. But\nLeibowitz is unwilling to engage in such idealistic guesswork, which\ngiven his positivistic leanings he dismisses as meaningless, claiming\nfundamentally not to understand how one is to relate seriously to such\nideals (Sihot, 92). The possibility that a state might have\nreligious significance \u201cin principle\u201d is not a discussion\nthat can have any political purchase. Political action simply cannot\nbe religious action. In reality then \u2013 and present reality is the\nonly reality he is willing to recognize by this point \u2013 Leibowitz\nwishes to keep political questions separate from religion, which in\nthe contemporary state must once again contract itself to the private\nsphere.\n\nThe views described above have further significant ramifications for\nLeibowitz\u2019s Zionism. Religiously speaking, a physical land\nsimply cannot be holy for Leibowitz: \u201cThe idea that a specific\ncountry or location has an intrinsic \u2018holiness\u2019 is an\nindubitably idolatrous idea.\u201d (Judaism, 226\u2013227).\nThus, the claim that a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian\nproblem cannot be countenanced because the land is holy to Jews is\nabsurd in Leibowitz\u2019s eyes. Moreover, given his hermeneutic of\nScripture, attempts to base the Jewish \u201cright\u201d to the land\non the basis of historical claims in the Torah are just as baseless.\nIndeed, without quite using the term \u201cnonsense on stilts\u201d\nLeibowitz nonetheless evinces a Benthamite scepticism to the notion\nthat any nation has a legal right to a land \u2013 \u201ctalk\nof rights is pure nonsense. No nation has a right to any land\u201d\n(Judaism, 241). Rights to land for Leibowitz are a matter of\nhistorical consciousness. And the problem for Israel and the\nPalestinians is that both tell a story that stakes a claim on this\nbasis such that \u201cin consequence of centuries of history, members\nof each feel passionately that this is their land\u201d\n(Judaism, 241).\n\nMoreover, imputing religious significance to the state (as opposed to\nthe land) is no less a form of \u201cidolatry.\u201d It yields\nviolence and injustice in the name of religion that is in truth the\nsheer willingness to commit moral atrocities in the name of the state,\nwhile hiding behind an illusory cloak of religious piety.\n\nLeibowitz\u2019s moral critique of the actions of the state and the\nIsraeli army, which rose to a new pitch subsequent to the Lebanon War\nof 1982, gives a clear indication of the significance of morality qua\nmorality for Leibowitz in a manner that is entirely consistent with\nthe view discussed earlier that morality must be subordinated to\nreligion and not vice versa. It is precisely because people mistakenly\nimpute religious value to objects or institutions that they commit\nmoral atrocities in the name of religion for Leibowitz. And it is\nprecisely the understanding of the state as a secular\ninstitution that for Leibowitz would prevent such actions, since we\nwill then judge these actions correctly \u2013 i.e., morally,\nnot religiously. And by ethical standards, Leibowitz clearly\nbelieves that the act of occupation cannot be justified. Yet again, it\nis the ascription of holiness to profane things, to the natural world\nand our human needs and interests within it, that is at the root of\nall that he decries in religion and that has dire political and moral\nconsequences in the contemporary political sphere. While one might\ndisagree with his political assessment on political grounds, he would\nargue that it is only on such grounds that one can disagree, and that\nis a dispute for a political, not theological forum.\n",
