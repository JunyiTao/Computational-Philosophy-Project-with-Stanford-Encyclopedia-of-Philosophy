    "main_text": "Probability, Knowledge and Verisimilitude\n6. Probability, Knowledge and Verisimilitude\n\nIn the view of many social scientists, the more probable a theory is,\nthe better it is, and if we have to choose between two\ntheories which differ only in that one is probable and the other is\nimprobable, then we should choose the former. Popper rejects this.\nScience values theories with a high informative content, because they\npossess a high predictive power and are consequently highly testable.\nFor that reason, the more improbable a theory is the better\nit is scientifically, because the probability and informative content\nof a theory vary inversely\u2014the higher the informative content of\na theory the lower will be its probability. Thus, the statements which\nare of special interest to science are those with a high informative\ncontent and (consequentially) a low probability, which\nnevertheless come close to the truth. Informative content,\nwhich is in inverse proportion to probability, is in direct proportion\nto testability. As a result, the severity of the test to which a\ntheory can be subjected, and by means of which it is falsified or\ncorroborated, is of fundamental importance.\n\nPopper also argues that all scientific criticism must be piecemeal,\ni.e., he holds that it is not possible to question every aspect of a\ntheory at once, as certain items of what he terms \u201cbackground\nknowledge\u201d must be taken for granted. But that is not\nknowledge in the sense of being conclusively established; it may be\nchallenged at any time, especially if it is suspected that its\nuncritical acceptance may be responsible for difficulties which are\nsubsequently encountered.\n\nHow then can one be certain that one is questioning the right thing?\nThe Popperian answer is that we cannot have absolute certainty here,\nbut repeated tests usually show where the trouble lies. As we saw, for\nPopper even observation statements are corrigible and open to review,\nand science in his view is not a quest for certain knowledge, but an\nevolutionary process in which hypotheses or conjectures are\nimaginatively proposed and tested in order to explain facts or to\nsolve problems. For that reason, he emphasises both the importance of\nquestioning the background knowledge when the need arises, and the\nsignificance of the fact that observation-statements are theory-laden\nand corrigible.\n\nPopper was initially uneasy with the concept of truth, and in his\nearliest writings he avoided asserting that a theory which is\ncorroborated is true\u2014for clearly if every theory is an\nopen-ended hypothesis, then ipso facto it has to be at least\npotentially false. However, he came to accept Tarski\u2019s\nreformulation of the correspondence theory of truth, and in\nConjectures and Refutations (1963) he integrates the concepts\nof truth and content to frame the metalogical concept of\n\u201ctruthlikeness\u201d or \u201cverisimilitude\u201d.\nA \u201cgood\u201d scientific theory, Popper argues in that work,\nhas a higher level of verisimilitude than its rivals, and he\nexplicates this concept by reference to the logical consequences of\ntheories. A theory\u2019s content is the totality of its logical\nconsequences, which can be divided into two classes:\n\nthe \u201ctruth-content\u201d, which is the class of\ntrue propositions which may be derived from it, and\nthe \u201cfalsity-content\u201d of a theory, which is\nthe class of the theory\u2019s false consequences (which may be\nempty, and in the case of a theory which is true is necessarily\nempty).\n\n\nPopper offers two accounts of how rival theories can be compared in\nterms of their levels of verisimilitude; these are the qualitative and\nquantitative definitions. On the qualitative account, verisimilitude\nis defined in terms of subclass relationships: a theory \\(t_2\\) has a\nhigher level of verisimilitude than \\(t_1\\) if and only if their\ntruth- and falsity-contents are comparable through subclass\nrelationships, and either\n\n\\(t_2\\)\u2019s truth-content includes \\(t_1\\)\u2019s and\n\\(t_2\\)\u2019s falsity-content, if it exists, is included in, or is\nthe same as, \\(t_1\\)\u2019s, or\n\\(t_2\\)\u2019s truth-content includes or is the same as\n\\(t_1\\)\u2019s and \\(t_2\\)\u2019s falsity-content, if it exists, is\nincluded in \\(t_1\\)\u2019s.\n\n\nOn the quantitative account, verisimilitude is defined by assigning\nquantities to contents, where the index of the content of a given\ntheory is its logical improbability, given again that content and\nprobability vary inversely (1963: 233\u20134). The utilisation of\neither method of computing verisimilitude shows, Popper argues, that\neven if a theory \\(t_2\\) with a higher content than a rival theory\n\\(t_1\\) is subsequently falsified, it can still legitimately be\nregarded as a better theory than \\(t_1\\), and \u201cbetter\u201d is\nhere now understood to mean \\(t_2\\) is closer to the truth\nthan \\(t_1\\) (1963: 235).\n\nThus, scientific progress involves, on this view, the abandonment of\npartially true, but falsified, theories, for theories with a higher\nlevel of verisimilitude, i.e., which approach more closely to the\ntruth. In this way, verisimilitude allowed Popper to mitigate what\nsome saw as the pessimism of an anti-inductivist philosophy of\nscience. With the introduction of the concept, Popper was able to\nrepresent his account as an essentially realistic position in terms of\nwhich scientific progress can be seen as progress towards the\ntruth, and experimental corroboration can be viewed as an\nindicator of verisimilitude.\n\nHowever, subsequent research revealed defects in Popper\u2019s formal\ndefinitions of verisimilitude. The concept is most important in his\nsystem because of its application to theories which are approximations\n(which are common in the social sciences) and thus known to be\nfalse. In this connection, Popper had written:\n\n\nUltimately, the idea of verisimilitude is most important in cases\nwhere we know that we have to work with theories which are at\nbest approximations\u2014that is to say, theories of which we\nknow that they cannot be true\u2026 In these cases we can still\nspeak of better or worse approximations to the truth (and we therefore\ndo not need to interpret these cases in an instrumentalist sense).\n(1963: 235)\n\n\nIn 1974, David Miller and Pavel Tich\u00fd, working independently,\ndemonstrated that the conditions specified by Popper in his accounts\nof both qualitative and quantitative verisimilitude for comparing the\ntruth- and falsity-contents of theories can be satisfied only when the\ntheories are true. In the crucially important case of false\ntheories, Popper\u2019s definitions are formally defective: for with\nregard to a false theory \\(t_2\\) which has excess content over a rival\ntheory \\(t_1\\), both the truth-content and the\nfalsity-content of \\(t_2\\) will exceed that of \\(t_1\\). With respect\nto theories which are false then, Popper\u2019s conditions for\ncomparing levels of verisimilitude, whether in quantitative and\nqualitative terms, can never be met.\n\nPopper\u2019s response was two-fold. In the first place, he\nacknowledges the deficiencies in his own formal account:\n\n\n\u201c\u2026my main mistake was the failure to see at once that my\n\u2019A Theorem on Truth-Content\u2019 [1966], could be extended to\nfalsity content: if the content of a false statement a\nexceeds that of a statement b, then the truth content of\na exceeds the truth content of b, and the same holds\nof their falsity contents.\u201d (1979, 371)\n\n\nBut he argues that\n\n\n\u201cI do think that we should not conclude from the failure of my\nattempts to solve the problem that the problem cannot be solved.\nPerhaps it cannot be solved by purely logical means but only by a\nrelativization to relevant problems or even by bringing in the\nhistorical problem situation\u201d (1979, 372).\n\n\nThis suggestion was to precipitate a great deal of important technical\nresearch in the field. He additionally moves the task of formally\ndefining the concept from centre-stage in his philosophy of science by\nprotesting that he had never intended to imply\n\n\nthat degrees of verisimilitude \u2026 can ever be numerically\ndetermined, except in certain limiting cases. (1979: 59)\n\n\nInstead, he argues, the chief value of the concept is heuristic, in\nwhich the absence of an adequate formal definition is not an\ninsuperable impediment to its utilisation in the actual appraisal of\ntheories relativised to problems in which we have an interest.\n\nMany see the thrust of this latter strategy as genuinely reflecting\nthe significance of the concept of verisimilitude in Popper\u2019s\nsystem, but it has not satisfied all of his critics.\n",
