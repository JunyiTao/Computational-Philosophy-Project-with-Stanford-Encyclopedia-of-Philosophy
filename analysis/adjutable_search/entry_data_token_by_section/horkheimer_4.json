    "main_text": "Materialism and The Early Program of the Institute of Social Research || The Epistemology and Methodology of Interdisciplinary Research\n2.4 The Epistemology and Methodology of Interdisciplinary Research\n\nHorkheimer\u2019s conception of interdisciplinary social research is\nrooted in, broadly construed, both empiricist and realist views.\nHorkheimer speaks often of such research as aiming at\n\u201cfacts,\u201d as seen in \u00a72.1 when he refers to the desire\nfor happiness as a natural fact. This connects to a kind of realism\nseen most directly in the 1935 essay \u201cOn the Problem of\nTruth.\u201d \u201cMaterialism\u201d he tells us, \u201cinsists\nthat objective reality is not identical with man\u2019s\nthought,\u201d and truth is determined by the \u201crelation of the\npropositions to reality\u201d (pp. 189, 194). But this realism has to\nbe qualified; materialism is distinguished from idealism through the\nappeal to an objective reality outside of our thinking, but it is\nfurther separated from metaphysical realism by its recognition that\nour knowing is historically bounded. Along these lines, Horkheimer\nadmits to holding to a correspondence theory of truth, but notes\nthat:\n\n\nThis correspondence is neither a simple datum [nor] an immediate\nfact...Rather, it is always established by real events and human\nactivity. Already in the investigation and determination of facts, and\neven more in the verification of theories, a role is played by the\ndirection of attention, the refinement of methods, the categorical\nstructure of the subject matter\u2014in short, by human activity\ncorresponding to the given social period. (p. 190)\n\n\nHere we find Horkheimer\u2019s epistemological considerations echoing\nhis critique of science. Presumably the \u201creal events and human\nactivity\u201d that grasp objective truth involve empirical research.\nBut because (as discussed in the critique of science) empirical\nresearch is always tied to a social context, one must see that the\ntruths it reveals are conditioned by the \u201chuman activity\ncorresponding to the given social period.\u201d Knowledge is always\naffected by the historical changes in our methods noted. But more than\ntheoretical or methodological changes that shift scientific theories,\nHorkheimer sees knowledge as being marked by our practical interests.\nThis is why a strong metaphysical conception of reality is unavailable\nto us; all thinking is marked by practical and theoretical interests\nthat are partial and subject to historical change.\n\nBut this point cannot be taken too far; truth is neither wholly\ndetermined by our practical interests nor by theory-dependent\nconditions of verification. When it is claimed that truth is dependent\non the \u201crelation of propositions to reality,\u201d Horkheimer\nmeans both of those to be given equal weight. While the weight put on\n\u201cpropositions\u201d (or better, human conceptual activity)\nremoves the possibility of a metaphysical theory of reality, it does\nnot remove reality. But because all inquiry into truth is historically\nand socially mediated, it is constantly open to adjustment. This\npoints out why the \u201ccontinuous, dialectical penetration\u201d\nof philosophy and science spoken of in the inaugural address is\nnecessary. Objective truths have to be grasped empirically, and the\nwork of the specialized sciences is thus necessary to determine the\ntruth of the current state of society. But \u201ctruth is\nadvanced\u201d only when \u201chuman beings who possess it stand by\nit unbendingly, apply it and carry it through, act according to it,\nand bring it to power against the resistance of reactionary, narrow,\none-sided points of view\u201d (Horkheimer 1935a, p. 4). This\nrequires that empirical research be saved from \u201cchaotic\nspecialization,\u201d and interpreted through an adequate theoretical\nframework. It is noteworthy in this regard that toward the end of the\ninaugural lecture, Horkheimer states that it is appropriate for the\nhead of the Institute to also hold a chair in social philosophy, as\nwas not the case with his predecessor who worked in the\n\u201cspecific discipline\u201d of political economy. For\nHorkheimer, it was properly the job of the philosopher to plan out and\nguide the interdisciplinary work of the Institute.\n\nHistorical exigencies kept the Institute\u2019s early researchers\nfrom implementing this program. They did press on with their empirical\nand theoretical efforts during the time of upheaval in the 1930s,\nproducing various small studies in the Zeitschrift f\u00fcr\nSozialforschung, and the larger Studies on Authority and the\nFamily. It is clearly the case, however, that there were many\ndifficulties in carrying out the empirical research that was used in\nthose studies (see the historical discussion of this period in\nWiggershaus 1994, 149\u2013156). Even if we set aside the historical\ndifficulties that beset the Institute during this time, there is still\nreason to question whether Horkheimer\u2019s interdisciplinary\nprogram could have been carried out successfully. One might doubt, for\nexample, that the philosophers who formed the core of the Frankfurt\nSchool, including Horkheimer himself, were actually open enough to the\nsciences. Jay 1996 (pp. 130\u2013131), Wiggershaus 1994 (p. 151), and\nWolin 1992 (pp. 56\u201358), argue that they were not, such that\ntheir theoretical works (especially in Studies on Authority and\nthe Family) were not really integrated with the empirical\nstudies. Perhaps more damningly, Bon\u00df 1993 argues that this\nfailure comes from faults internal to Horkheimer\u2019s\nmethodological and epistemological considerations such that \u201cthe\ninterdisciplinary claim amounts to no more than an external formula\nfor integration\u201d (p. 118). This seems fair insofar as Horkheimer\nspent a great deal of energy claiming that empirical and theoretical\nresearch should be combined, and explaining why they should be\ncombined, but did very little to explain how they would be so\ncombined. It remains to be shown if one might reactivate\nHorkheimer\u2019s intentions while providing a better explanation of\nhow such integrated research might actually work. Clearly, however,\nHorkheimer would come to gradually doubt the efficacy of such a\nprogram; one can begin to trace out this shift by examining the 1937\nessay \u201cTraditional and Critical Theory\u201d (this separation\nof the 1937 essay from the earlier \u201cmaterialist\u201d works\nroughly follows arguments in Dubiel 1985).\n",
