However, it is only since the\nearly Eighties that a genuine mathematics of non-well-founded sets\n(see |\n\n set theory: non-wellfounded)\n is being developed. Using the axiom AFA of anti-foundation, direct\nself-reference is allowed in set theory, and there exist plenty of\nsets solving general self-referential equations (AFA was introduced by\nForti and Honsell in 1983; for systematic development and history, see\nAczel 1988). In particular, non-wellfounded sets are applied to the\nanalysis of the paradoxes, to the semantics of natural languages and\nto theoretical computer science (see Barwise and Etchemendy 1984,\nBarwise and Moss 1996).\n\nConcerning the issue whether self-reference can be avoided in deriving\nparadoxes, and hence whether there are genuine contradictions arising\nfrom ungroundedness, a positive answer has been given by the\nsemantical paradox of Yablo 1993: there are infinitely many agents ,\netc., each one claiming the same sentence: \u201cat least one agent\nfollowing me is lying\u201d; but this yields a contradiction \u2013\nsee also the entries on\n self-reference\n and\n liar paradox.\n The issue this construction raises, namely whether circularity and\nself-reference are necessary and sufficient conditions to the\nappearance of paradoxes, has been further considered in Yablo 2006\n(see Cook 2014 for a comprehensive study on this matter, and Halbach\nand Zhang 2017 for a proof without diagonal lemma). Moreover, the\nconnection between the incompleteness phenomena and paradoxes has been\nextended up to include Yablo\u2019s paradox, as a special case of\nLiar-type paradoxes (Kurahashi 2014, Kikuchi and Kurahashi 2016).\n\nThe analysis of self-reference and diagonalization has motivated the\napplication of algebraic and topological techniques: consider\nScott\u2019s models for extensional lambda calculus (Scott 1972) and\ntheir subsequent categorical understanding. On the other hand,\ncategory theory has been used for new approaches to paradoxes since\nLawvere 1969. A mathematical approach to the general issue of\n\u201cself-reference vs. unfoundedness\u201d can be found in\nBernardi 2001, 2009. Besides Yablo\u2019s paradox and a game\ntheoretic version of Mirimanoff\u2019s paradox, several classical\nresults (existence of a non-r.e. set, Cantor\u2019s theorems on the\nnondenumerability of the reals) can be transformed into existence\ntheorems for suitable unfounded chains (and formally, unfounded chains\nare regarded as generalized fixed points).\n",
