    "main_text": "Nurturing Life (yang sheng)\n2. Nurturing Life (yang sheng)\n\n\nSeveral Warring States texts express the need to preserve\none\u2019s person, self, or essential nature:\n\n\nTherefore the sage puts his person last and it comes first, Treats\nit as extraneous and it is preserved. (Daode jing, chap.\n7)\n\n\nOne way to do this was to maintain health by nurturing life\n(yang sheng), an area of common ground for speculative\nthinkers and practitioners of traditional medical arts. The term\nyang sheng first appears in the Zhuangzi and\nthen throughout a range of second (BCE) century medical literature.\n\n\nThe third chapter of the Zhuangzi is titled \u201cThe Lord\nof Nurturing Life\u201d (Yang sheng zhu\n\u990a\u751f\u4e3b). In it, the expert butcher Pao Ding\ninstructs Duke Hui of Liang. Pao Ding describes the process of\nmastering his skill. His method is initially analytic; he begins by\nstudying oxen as wholes, next as parts, and finally with faculties\nbeyond ordinary vision. This discourse is presented as an instruction\nto the Lord Wenhui, who ends by saying that: \u201cPao Ding has taught\nme how to nurture life\u201d (yang sheng, Zhuangzi\n3, 124, cf. Watson 2013, 20).\n\n\nAnother passage in the Outer Chapters refers to some of these\nexercises. It contrasts \u201creal sages\u201d who follow the way of\nheaven and earth with (among others) practitioners of \u201cnurturing\nlife\u201d traditions who:\n\n\nblow out, breathe in, old out, new in, dormant like the bear,\nneck-stretched like the bird, their only care for longevity; these are\nthe practitioners of \u201cguide-and-pull\u201d [dao yin\n\u5c0e\u5f15] and \u201cnourishing the body\u201d [yang\nxing \u990a\u5f62] who desire the longevity of Pengzu\n(Zhuangzi 15, 535, cf. Watson 2013, 119).\n\n\nThe passage continues. Real sages:\n\n\ncultivate [their persons] without benevolence and righteousness,\ngovern without merit or fame, are at ease without needing rivers and\nseas, attain longevity without \u201cguiding and pulling,\u201d\nforget everything but lack for nothing, placid without limit, things of\nvalue follow upon them (ch. 15, 537, cf. Graham 1986a, 265;\nWatson 2013, 119).\n\n\nSince the whole point of the Zhuangzi passage is to oppose\n\u201cguiding and pulling\u201d and other longevity techniques to\ntrue sagehood, it does not dwell on their details. We can get a better\nidea of what he might have been talking about from other sources. Some\nof these ideas are elaborated in a chapter of the Guanzi\ntitled \u201cInner Cultivation\u201d (Nei ye), which\ndescribes the cultivation of qi, as well as vital essence\n(jing), and spirit (shen). It describes Dao as\nliterally pervading the body or the person of a sage:\n\n\nSo long as the wellspring is not exhausted, \nThe passages of the nine apertures will remain clear.\nThus it is possible to explore the limits of Heaven and Earth, and\ncover the four seas. (Guanzi 16.3a8\u20133b1; trans. Rickett\n1998, 48).\n\n\nThe Zhuangzi and other texts refer to the figure of the\nspirit person or shen ren \u795e\u4eba as someone who has\neffectively transformed the physical body and the qi that\nconstitutes it. The Zhuangzi describes spirit person of Guye,\nwho concentrates his spirit (shen), avoids the five grains,\nrides the clouds, and, through the concentration of his shen\nprotects others against sicknesses and epidemics and makes the harvest\nripen (Zhuangzi 1, 28; cf. Graham, 1986a, 46). This passage\nsuggests that a sage can have a nurturing effect on the world by acting\nat a distance, possibly as an unintended by-product of self-cultivation\npractices.\n\n\nOther passages in the Zhuangzi extol the abilities of\nspecialized craftsmen who possess highly technical skills. These\nstories liken mastery of the Way to mastery of a craft. They also\nemphasize the technical skills of commoners. Commoners, rather than\nrulers, are presented as sage-like figures. These technical experts\ninclude arrow makers, bell-stand carvers, boatmen, butchers, cicada\ncatchers, potters, sword makers, and wheelwrights (Raphals 2005). It is\ncurious that these passages never include physicians. \n\n\nIn the Han dynasty, \u201cnurturing life\u201d techniques became a\nmajor concern of the Recipe Masters (fang shi) of the Han\ncourt (Ngo 1976). Texts on nurturing life include methods for absorbing\nand circulating qi in the body\u2014for example, breathing and\nmeditation exercises, diet, drugs and sexual techniques.\n\n\nMedical and mantic texts excavated from tombs make it clear that a\nwide range of longevity techniques had been developed before the Han\ndynasty (Harper 1998, 33). Most important is a corpus of medical\nmanuscripts excavated from Mawangdui \u99ac\u738b\u5806\n(Changsha, Hubei), dated to 169 BCE. This tomb is best known for its\ntwo versions of the Daode jing, but it is meaningful to locate\nthose texts among other texts of a scientific provenance found in the\ntomb (Harper 1998 and 2000, Ma Jixing 1992, Zhou Yimou 1994, Zhou \nYimou and Xiao Zuotai 1987).\n\n\nSix of the medical manuscripts are concerned with nurturing life in\nvarious ways. \u201cHarmonizing Yin and Yang\u201d (He yin\nyang \u5408\u9670\u967d) and \u201cDiscussion of the\nRealized Way of All Under Heaven\u201d (Tianxia zhi dao tan\n\u5929\u4e0b\u81f3\u9053\u8ac7) are concerned with sexual\ncultivation. They refer to the movements and postures of animals as\nwhole-body metaphors for sexual techniques. An example is the\ndescription of ten postures in \u201cHarmonizing Yin and\nYang\u201d:\n\n\nThe ten postures: the first is \u201ctiger roving\u201d; the second\nis \u201ccicada clinging\u201d; the third is \u201cmeasuring\nworm\u201d; the fourth is \u201criver deer butting\u201d; the fifth\nis \u201clocust splayed\u201d; the sixth is \u201cgibbon\ngrabbing\u201d; the seventh is \u201ctoad\u201d; the eighth is\n\u201crabbit bolting\u201d; the ninth is \u201cdragonfly\u201d;\nthe tenth is \u201cfish gobbling.\u201d (Harper 1998,\n418)\n\n\nThese texts emphasize that sexual activity is a natural process, but\none that must be regulated. As the \u201cRealized Way of All Under\nHeaven\u201d puts it, people know by nature how to breathe and how to\neat, but everything else is a matter of learning and habit. \u201cWhat\nassists life is eating; what injures life is lust. Therefore the sage\nwhen conjoining male and female invariably possesses a model\u201d\n(Zhou and Xiao 1989, 431; Harper 1998, 432).\n\n\n\u201cRecipes for Nurturing Life\u201d (Yang sheng fang\n\u990a\u751f\u65b9) consists of eighty-seven recipes, including\nfood, drugs, and beverages, along with several sexual cultivation\nexercises. \u201cEliminating Grain and Eating Vapor\u201d (Que gu\nshi qi \u537b\u6996\u98df\u6c23) specifies diet and\nbreathing exercises to be performed in the morning and evening, and a\nseasonal regimen of breath cultivation through consuming six qi and\navoiding another five (Harper 1998, 25\u201330). Another text, the\n\u201cTen Questions\u201d (Shi wen \u5341\u554f) gives\nadvice on techniques for nurturing life (Harper 1998, 22\u201330), for\nexample:\n\n\nYao asked Shun: \u201cIn Under-heaven what is most\nvaluable?\u201d\n\nShun replied: \u201cLife is most valuable.\u201d\n\nYao said: \u201cHow can life be cultivated?\u201d Shun said:\n\u201cInvestigate yin and yang.\u201d (Zhou Yimou and Xiao Zuotao\n1989, 379; Harper 1998, 399)\n\n\n\nFinally, the \u201cDrawings of Guiding and Pulling\u201d\n(Daoyin tu \u5c0e\u5f15\u5716) is a series of forty-four\ndrawings of human figures performing exercises, some with captions.\nSome are described in another excavated text from tomb no. 247,\nZhangjiashan \u5f35\u5bb6\u5c71 (Jiangling, Hubei). The\n\u201cPulling Book\u201d (Yin shu \u5f15\u66f8) from\nZhangjiashan describes exercises that refer to or are named after\nanimals, including inchworms, snakes, mantises, wild ducks, owls,\ntigers, chickens, bears, frogs, deer, and dragons. Both exemplify a\ntradition of exercise for both therapy and health known as\ndaoyin (pulling and guiding).\n\n\nThe \u201cyang sheng culture\u201d of these texts\nemphasized control over physiological and mental processes, both\nunderstood as self-cultivation, through the transformation of qi.\n\u201cSelf-cultivation\u201d in this context included moral\nexcellence, health, and longevity (V. Lo 2001).\n\n\nWe can get a broader notion of what these techniques were like if we\nturn to the list of titles from the \u201cRecipes and Methods\u201d\nsection of the Han shu Bibliographic Treatise, mentioned\nabove. One of the few extant texts it lists is the Huang Di\nneijing, along with the titles of lost medical works on nurturing\nlife, health, and longevity. The \u201cClassical Recipes\u201d\n(jing fang) section includes titles such as \u201cRecipes for\nMarried Women and Infants\u201d (Furen ying er fang\n\u5a66\u4eba\u5b30\u5152\u65b9) and \u201cFood Prohibitions\nof Shen Nong and Huang Di\u201d (Shen Nong Huang Di shi jin\n\u795e\u8fb2\u9ec3\u5e1d\u98df\u7981). The sexual arts\nsection includes \u201cRecipes of Huang Di and the Three Sage-Kings\nfor Nurturing Yang\u201d (Huang Di san wang yang yang fang\n\u9ec3\u5e1d\u4e09\u738b\u990a\u967d\u65b9) and\n\u201cInner Chamber Recipes of the Three Schools for Having\nChildren\u201d (San jia nei ju you zi fang\n\u4e09\u5bb6\u5167\u623f\u6709\u5b50\u65b9). Other\nsections describe physical exercises and therapeutic techniques, such\nas the \u201cStepping and Pulling Book of Huang Di and Other Masters\u201d\n(Huang Di za zi bu yin\n\u9ec3\u5e1d\u96dc\u5b50\u6b65\u5f15 (Han shu 30,\n1778\u201379).\n\n\nAnother medical text from Mawangdui is a recipe (fang\n\u65b9) manual titled Recipes for Fifty-Two Ailments\n(Wushier bing fang \u4e94\u5341\u4e8c\u75c5\u65b9,\ntranslated and discussed in Harper 1998). Recipe texts also have been\nexcavated from Zhangjiashan (Li Ling 1993 and 2000). In addition, the\nMawangdui tombs also contained hexagram divination texts and charts and\ndiagrams on cloud divination and physiognomy, including the oldest\nknown representation of a comet (Li Ling 1993).\n\n\nIn summary, most of these texts can be described as part of a\nyang sheng culture, which offered and emphasized control over\nphysiological processes of the body and mind that were understood as\ntransformations of qi. What is the relation of these detailed\ntechnical texts to philosophy? These technical arts form a continuum\nwith philosophy because their transformations were understood as\nself-cultivation in the coterminous senses of moral excellence, health,\nand longevity (rather than medical pathology), and physiological\ntransformation through the manipulation of qi (V. Lo\n2001).\n\n\nMark Csikszentmihalyi (2004) describes them as part of an\n\u201cembodied virtue\u201d tradition of self-cultivation practices.\nThey structured much of early Daoist philosophy and medical theory, and\nalso had profound effects on early Chinese ethics and metaphysics (V.\nLo 2005). Such \u201cmaterial virtue\u201d traditions held that the\nbody-mind was constructed of qi and that embodied\nself-cultivation practices could transform qi. These views\ninformed Warring States accounts of dietary practices, exercise\nregimens, breath meditation, sexual cultivation techniques, and other\ntechnical traditions associated with fang shi. Material virtue\ntraditions also had important links with Daoist texts, southern\nschools, and the \u201cmoralization\u201d of health in traditions\nthat culminated in the Huang Di neijing. Accounts of these\npractices appear in passing in the texts of the received tradition.\nMany more come from texts excavated from tombs.\n",
