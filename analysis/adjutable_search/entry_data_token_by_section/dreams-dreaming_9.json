    "main_text": "The ontology of dreams || Dreams and illusions\n2.5 Dreams and illusions\n\nAnother way to make sense of the claim that dreaming has the same\nphenomenal character as waking perception is to say some kinds of\ndream imagery are illusory: they involve misperception of an external\nobject as having different properties than it actually has (cf. Smith\n2002; Crane & French 2017). The illusion view disagrees with the\nhallucination view on whether dreams have a contemporaneous external\nstimulus source.\n\nThe illusion view has fallen out of favor but has a long history. The\nAncients believed dreams have bodily sources. This idea underlies the\npractice of using dreams to diagnose illness, as practiced in the\nshrines at Epidaurus (Galen On Diagnosis in Dreams; van de\nCastle 1994). Aristotle (On Dreams) thought some dreams are\ncaused by indigestion, and Hobbes adopted this view, claiming\ndifferent kinds of dreams could be traced to different bodily\nsensations. For instance, \u201clying cold breedeth Dreams of Feare,\nand raiseth the thought and Image of some fearfull object\u201d\n(Hobbes 1651: 91).\n\nAppeals to the bodily sources of dreaming became especially popular in\nthe 19th and early 20th centuries. Many believed\nspecific dream themes such as flying were linked to sleeping position\n(Macnish 1838; Scherner 1861; Vold 1910/1912; Ellis 1911) and\nrealizing, in sleep, that one\u2019s feet are not touching the ground\n(Bergson 1914).\n\nThere were also attempts to explain the phenomenology of dreaming by\nappealing to the absence of outward movement. The lack of appropriate\nfeedback and of movement and touch sensations was thought to cause\ndreams of being unable to move (Bradley 1894) or of trying but failing\nto do something (Gregory 1918).\n\nSome proponents of the \u201cLeibreiztheorie\u201d (or\nsomatic-stimulus theory) of dreaming attempted to go beyond anecdotal\nobservations to conduct controlled experiments. Weygandt (1893)\ninvestigated the influence of various factors including breathing,\nblood circulation, temperature changes, urge to urinate, sleeping\nposition, and visual or auditory stimulation during sleep on dream\ncontent (see Schredl 2010 for details). Singer (1924) proposed\nexperiments on stimulus incorporation in dreams can inform claims on\nthe ontology of dreaming: If dreams are sensations, a particular\nauditory stimulus should increase the frequency of dreams in nearby\nsleepers as well as the frequency of sound in their dreams, and it\nshould decrease the range of quality and intensity of these dreams,\nmaking them overall more similar and predictable.\n\nNewer studies provide evidence for the incorporation of external\nstimuli in dreams, including light flashes, sounds, sprays of water\napplied to the skin (Dement & Wolpert 1958), thermal (Baldridge\n1966), electrical (Koulack 1969), and verbal stimuli (Berger 1963;\nBreger et al. 1971; Hoelscher et al., 1981), as well as blood pressure\ncuff stimulation on the leg (Nielsen et al. 1995; Sauvageau et al.\n1998).\n\nMuscular activity also often leaves its mark on dreams. It occurs\nthroughout sleep but is especially frequent in REM sleep, mostly in\nthe form of twitching but occasionally also in the form of larger,\nseemingly goal-directed movements (Blumberg 2010; Blumberg &\nPlumeau 2016). The relation between outward and dream movements is\ncomplex: in some cases, outward movements might mirror dream\nmovements, while in others, sensory feedback might prompt dream\nimagery (Windt 2018).\n\nGenerally, it seems external and bodily stimuli can be related to\nvarying degrees to dream and sleep onset imagery (Nielsen 2017; Windt\n2018; Windt et al. 2016). Some of these cases appear to fit the\nconcept of illusion, as in when the sound of the alarm clock is\nexperienced, in a dream, as a siren, or when blood pressure cuff\ninflation on the leg leads to dreams of wearing strange shoes (Windt\n2018; for these and other examples, see Nielsen et al. 1995). In other\ncases, such as when blood pressure cuff stimulation on the leg prompts\na dream of seeing someone else\u2019s leg being run over, describing this\nas illusory misperception might be less straightforward.\n\nSaying that dreams can be prompted by external stimuli and that in\nsome cases these are best described as illusions is different from the\nstronger claim, sometimes advanced by historical proponents of\nsomatic-stimulus theory, that dreams generally are caused by\nexternal or bodily stimuli. As an example of the stronger claim,\nconsider Wundt\u2019s proposal that the\n\n\nideas which arise in dreams come, at least to a great extent, from\nsensations, especially from those of the general sense, and are\ntherefore mostly illusions of fancy, probably only seldom pure memory\nideas which hence become hallucinations. (Wundt 1896: 179) \n\n\nThis claim is likely too strong. It is also likely that appeals to\nexternal or bodily stimuli on their own cannot fully explain dream\nimagery, including when and how external stimuli are incorporated in\ndreams. Sensory incorporation in dreams is often hard to predict and\nindirect; associated imagery seems related not just to stimulus\nintensity, but also to short- and long term memories. A full\nexplanation of dream content additionally has to take the cognitive\nand memory sources of dreaming into account (Windt 2018; Nielsen 2017;\ncf. Silberer 1919).\n",
