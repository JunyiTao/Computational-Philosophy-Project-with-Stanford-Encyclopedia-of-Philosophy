We shall\nconcentrate here on aspects of this logic that can be understood\nwithout going deeply into formal details.\n\n\nThe language of Kaplan\u2019s logic is that of modal first-order\npredicate logic with tense operators and other additions. The additions\ninclude a distinguished predicate \u2018Exists\u2019, a distinguished\nbinary predicate \u2018Located\u2019, a distinguished constant\n\u2018I\u2019, a distinguished constant \u2018Here\u2019, and a\nfunction-term \u2018dthat\u2019.\n\n\nIn standard first-order predicate logic, validity is defined as\ntruth in all structures (sometimes called \u2018models\u2019) of a\ncertain sort. In modal logic, validity is typically defined as truth at\nevery world in every structure of a certain (different) sort. Kaplan\nsimilarly defines validity as truth at every context in every\nLD structure. (\u2018LD\u2019 stands for \u2018the Logic of\nDemonstratives\u2019.) Each LD structure contains a set of\ncontexts, a set of worlds, a set of individuals, a set of positions\n(common to all worlds), a set of times (common to all worlds), and a\nfunction that assigns to each predicate and individual constant an\nintension, which is a function from time-world pairs to extensions.\n(Thus Kaplan\u2019s LD structures do not assign structured contents to\nexpressions in contexts. LD structures use intensions to\nrepresent contents.) Each context has an associated agent,\ntime, position, and world. Various stipulations about structures and\ncontexts together ensure that, for every context \\(c\\) in every\nstructure M: (i) the agent of \\(c\\) is a member of the extension of\n\u2018Exist\u2019 at the time and world of \\(c\\), and (ii) the\nordered pair \n\\(\\langle \\text{the agent of } c, \\text{the position of } c \\rangle\\) \nis a member of the extension of \u2018Located\u2019 at\nthe time and world of \\(c\\).\n\n\nKaplan uses standard methods to define truth for a formula,\nand denotation for a term, with respect to any given\nstructure, context, time, world and assignment of values to variables.\n(Assignments will not be mentioned from here on.) Kaplan defines the\nnotions of Content and Character for formulas and terms in terms of\ntruth and denotation. The Content of a formula, with respect to a\nstructure and context, is a function whose value at any time-world pair\nis the truth-value of the formula with respect to the preceding\nstructure, context, time, and world. In short, the Content of an\nexpression, with respect to a structure and context, is an intension.\nThe Content of a singular term, with respect to a structure and\ncontext, is also an appropriate intension. Finally, the Character of a\nformula or term is the function from structures and contexts to\nContents whose value, for any structure and context, is the Content of\nthat expression with respect to that structure and context.\n\n\nA formula is true at a context \\(c\\) in a structure \\(M\\)\niff: the formula is true with respect to \\(c\\) and the time and\nworld of \\(c\\) in \\(M\\). A formula is valid iff: for\nevery structure \\(M\\), and every context \\(c\\) of \\(M\\),\nthe formula is true at \\(c\\) in \\(M\\). Kaplan says that the\nnotion of logical consequence can be defined in any of the usual\nways.\n",
