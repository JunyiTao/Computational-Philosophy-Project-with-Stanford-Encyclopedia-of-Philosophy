    "main_text": "The Allocation of Organs || Self-inflicted illness and social value\n3.3 The interaction of allocation and donation\n\nIn the economy, the amount produced depends in part on how production\nwill be allocated, at least insofar as people respond to incentives\n(see the entry on\n distributive justice).\n For instance, a guaranteed equal share gives no self-interested\nincentive to work hard or in an efficient job. In organ\ntransplantation, the number of organs available also depends on how\nthey would be allocated. In the economy, ideal allocation principles\nmay have to yield to the reality of incentives, which is why it is\noften thought that strict equality is precluded by concern for\nefficiency. Similarly, transplantation seems to face a choice; it can\nkeep its ideal principles and have fewer organs or compromise them and\nhave more. Some examples discussed here are live donation, kidney\nexchanges, directed deceased donation, priority to donors, and\npriority to children. These examples are diverse so one cannot\nstraightforwardly tell whether practice in one is consistent with\npractice in another. Nonetheless, they have in common the question:\nwhat if the usual principles of allocation led to fewer organs being\ndonated than would deviating from those principles? That they have\nthis question in common has not been widely appreciated, which may\nexplain why the question has been answered in different ways in the\nexamples described below.\n\nLive donation. Most live organ donations have a designated\nrecipient, usually a relative or friend (Baily et al. 2020). Usually\nthe designated recipient is not the person who would have got the\norgan if it were allocated via the method for deceased donor organs.\nTransplantation systems could refuse such offers for the sake of their\nnormal allocation principles\u2014but they do not. One obvious\nsufficient reason is that, if the organs were not allocated to the\nperson the donor designates, the donor would not donate and an organ\nwould be forgone.\n\nThe suspension of normal allocation principles when live donation is\ninvolved often passes by without notice, although one recent exception\nis a debate over people on transplant waiting lists who use social\nmedia campaigns to find willing donors (Moorlock 2015; Moorlock and\nDraper 2018). Such cases are a good illustration of the shape of the\nunderlying issue. If these donors were merely being redirected \u2013 that\nis, if they were intending to donate anyway, even without a social\nmedia campaign \u2013 then arguably suspending the normal principles would\nbe tantamount to unfair queue jumping via what has been termed a\n\u201cbeauty contest\u201d. But if these social media campaigns\nbring new donors and extra organs into the system, and provided that\nother ethical conditions are met (notably the valid consent of the\ndonor), then it would seem churlish to reject such offers, given their\ncapacity to extend and/or improve recipients\u2019 lives.\n\nKidney exchange. Sometimes potential live kidney donors\ncannot donate to the recipients they wish because their kidneys are\nincompatible with the recipient\u2019s body. Many systems now arrange\ncomplicated swaps whereby pairs or more than pairs of live donors give\nto each other\u2019s recipients (Fortin 2013). Sometimes people\ndonate into the general pool in exchange for their preferred recipient\ngetting the next available deceased donor kidney. Unless the preferred\nrecipients would happen to get the deceased donor organ anyway under\nnormal allocation rules, they jump the queue. As with more common\nmethods of live donation, the normal allocation principles are\nsuspended so as not to forgo extra organs.\n\nDirected deceased donation. Much more controversial is\ndirected deceased donation. The direction can take the form of naming\na recipient, as when a dying person stipulates that she wants her\norgan to go to her daughter. Or it can take the form of specifying a\ngroup either to receive or be denied the organ. The most controversial\ndirection has been ethnic, when donors or their families have tried to\nprevent organs going to members of certain ethnic groups (T.M.\nWilkinson 2007b). On the face of it, refusing directed donations\nforgoes organs for the sake of a principle of allocation, which is the\nopposite of practice with live donation. Matters are more complicated\nbecause the overall incentive effects of accepting directed donations\nare unclear. However, jurisdictions such as the U.K. have banned\naccepting directed donation for reasons besides the overall effect on\nthe organ supply (U.K. Department of Health 2000 in\n Other Internet Resources).\n They have cited principles such as allocation according to need as\ngiving sufficient reason, independent of effect on numbers. A\nconsistency argument can be put to them: why do they accept deviations\nfrom allocation according to need in the case of live donation but\nreject them for deceased donation?\n\nPriority to donors. A minority of jurisdictions give some\npriority in receiving organs to those who have declared their\nwillingness to donate (Cronin 2014). One reason is the supposed\nincentive effect of giving priority to donors of encouraging more\ndonations. Priority schemes have been criticized on practical grounds\nbut some criticism invokes principles, such as allocation according to\nneed (Quigley et al. 2012). As before, the principles are supposed by\nthose who cite them to be sufficient to defeat priority schemes even\nif they would produce more organs. By contrast, the principles are not\nthought to outweigh getting more organs with live donation and kidney\nexchange.\n\nPriority to children. Nearly all jurisdictions give priority\nto children when allocating kidneys from deceased donors. One upshot\nseems to be a reduction in the overall supply of organs, at least in\nthe United States (Axelrod et al. 2010). People who would have been\nlive donors to children do not donate when the children get rapid\naccess to deceased donor kidneys. Perhaps potential living donors\nwould rather have the child get a deceased donor organ than run the\nrisk for themselves; perhaps they would like to hold their kidneys in\nreserve in case the children need retransplantation or other children\nneed them. One might think that if priority to children reduces the\nnumber of living donors to them it should increase the number of\nliving donors to adults. Nonetheless, the overall effect is negative.\nAs before, those who endorse the principle of priority to children\nhave some choosing to do; how many organs are they willing to forgo\nfor the sake of the principle, and is the answer consistent with their\nwillingness to accept designated live organ donations (T.M. Wilkinson\nand Dittmer 2016)? A more unpalatable choice would arise if\ndiscriminating against children produced more organs via live\ndonation.\n",
