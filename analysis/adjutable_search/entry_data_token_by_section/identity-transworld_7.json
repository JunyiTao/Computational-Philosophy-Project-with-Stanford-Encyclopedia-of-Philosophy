(Such a set of properties\nwould be what is called a non-trivial individual essence of\nRussell, where an individual essence of an individual A is a\nproperty, or set of properties, whose possession by an individual in\nany possible world is both necessary and sufficient for identity with\nA.)\n\n\nThat this possibility is left open by the arguments so far considered\nis suggested by at least two points. The first concerns the analogy\ndrawn above between transworld identity and identity through time.\nEven if we can understand the claim that there is some past time at\nwhich Angela Merkel is a baby without being able to specify\ninformative (non-trivial) necessary and sufficient conditions for the\nidentity of the adult Angela Merkel with some previously existing\ninfant, it does not follow that there are no such necessary\nand sufficient conditions. And many philosophers have supposed that\nthere are such conditions for personal identity over time. Secondly,\nthe fact that one may be able to ensure, by stipulation, that one is\ntalking about a possible world in which Bertrand Russell (and\nnot someone else) is a playwright (if there is such a world) does not\nimply that, when making this stipulation, one is not\nimplicitly stipulating that this individual satisfies, in\nthat world, conditions non-trivially necessary and sufficient for\nbeing Russell, even if one is not in a position to say what these\nconditions are.\n\nThis second point is an extension of the observation that, if (as most\nphilosophers believe) Bertrand Russell has some essential properties\n(properties that he has in all possible worlds in which he exists), to\nstipulate that one is talking about a possible world in which Russell\nis a playwright is, at least implicitly, to stipulate that the\npossible world is one in which someone with Russell\u2019s essential\nproperties is a playwright. For example, according to Kripke\u2019s\n\u2018necessity of origin\u2019 thesis, human beings have their\nparents essentially (Kripke 1980). If this is correct, then, when we\nsay \u2018There is a possible world in which Russell is a\nplaywright\u2019, it seems that, if our stipulation is to be\ncoherent, we must be at least implicitly stipulating that the possible\nworld is one in which someone with Russell\u2019s actual\nparents is a playwright, even if the identity of Russell\u2019s\nparents is unknown to us, and even though we are (obviously) in no\nposition to conduct an empirical investigation into the ancestry, in\nthe possible world, of the individuals who exist there. Thus, it\nseems, even if Kripke is right in insisting that we need not be able\nto specify non-trivial necessary and sufficient conditions\nfor being Russell in another possible world if we are legitimately to\nclaim that there are possible worlds in which he is a playwright, it\nmight nevertheless be the case that there are such necessary\nand sufficient conditions (cf. Kripke 1980, 46\u201347 and 18, note\n17; Lewis 1986, 222).\n\nBut what positive reasons are there for holding that transworld\nidentities require non-trivial necessary and sufficient conditions\n(non-trivial individual essences), if arguments that are based on the\nepistemological, security of reference, and intelligibility\nassumptions are abandoned? (Similar issues arise for the transworld\nidentities of properties, discussed in the supplement on\n transworld identity of properties.)\n",
