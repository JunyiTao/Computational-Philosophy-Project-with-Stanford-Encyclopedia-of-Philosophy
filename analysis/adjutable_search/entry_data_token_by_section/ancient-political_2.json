    "main_text": "Politics and Philosophy in Ancient Greece || Politics, Justice, and Equality\n2.2 Politics, Justice, and Equality\n\nJustice, then, depended on treating equals equally, and distributing\ncitizenship and the privileges of officeholding accordingly. Yet how\nshould \u201cthe equal\u201d be understood? This became the major\npolitical faultline of the Greek fifth century BCE. Oligarchical\nregimes might consider only the\n kalokagathoi[2]\u2014the \n elite and well-born, usually also wealthy landowners\n\u2014to be full equals; democratic regimes, by contrast, tended to\ntreat the \u201cmany\u201d (or some large proportion of them) as\npolitical equals of the elite \u201cfew,\u201d in the fullest\ndemocracies enfranchising all free- and native-born\n men.[3]\n Sparta, a unique political entity, still exemplified the same broad\npattern in naming its citizens \u201cthe equals\u201d or (more\nliterally) \u201cthe peers\u201d (hoi\n homoioi).[4]\n The absence of slave status made one free but not necessarily a\ncitizen. Slavery for its part was little discussed as an explicit\npolitical question, though Aristotle recognized that the question of\nits justice or injustice had indeed been raised at least in\ntheoretical debate and needed to be addressed, which he did himself by\nsketching out a kind of slavery that could in principle (so he\nclaimed) be just by nature (see 4.3 below; Garnsey 1996 on slavery in\nGreek thought from Aristotle to Augustine). The exclusion of women\nfrom active citizenship in Athens was more consciously felt, giving\nrise to fantasies of female-dominated politics in Aristophanic comedy\n(Lysistrata, Assemblywomen) and to tortured\nreflection in many tragedies (consider the titles of Medea\nand Trojan Women, both Athenian works setting explorations of\nwomen\u2019s roles in the dramatic contexts of archaic foreign\npolities).\n\nAmong equals, however defined, the space of the political was the\nspace of participation in decision-making concerning public affairs\nand actions. That invention of the political (what Meier 1990 calls\nThe Greek Discovery of Politics) was the hallmark of the\nclassical Greek world. Citizens, whether the few (usually the rich) or\nthe many (including the poorer and perhaps the poorest free adult\nmen), gathered together to conduct public affairs, sharing either by\ncustom, by election, or by lot\u2014the latter seen in Athens as the\nmost democratic, though it was never the sole mechanism used in any\nGreek democracy\u2014in holding, or holding accountable, the offices\nfor carrying them out. Rhetoric played an important role in shaping\nthose decisions, especially, though not only, in democracies, where\ndiscursive norms shaped by the poor majority were hegemonic in public\neven over the rich (Ober 1989).\n\nAt the same time, politics was shaped by the legacy of archaic poetry\nand its heroic ethos and by the religious cults which included,\nalongside pan-Hellenic and familial rites, important practices\ndistinct to each city-state. This was a polytheistic, rather than\nmonotheistic, setting, in which religion was at least in large part a\nfunction of civic identity. It was a world innocent of modern\nbureaucracy and of the modern move to intellectual abstraction in\ndefining the state: the entity we would call \u201cAthens\u201d in\nthe abstract was called in its own day by the collective noun for its\nliving and breathing citizens, \u201cthe Athenians.\u201d So if\nancient political philosophy left out much that modern political\nphilosophy would include (e.g., for the most part, the question of the\njustness of slavery), it also included much that the latter would tend\nto exclude. Not only the civic religious cult, but also the patterns\nof child-rearing, cultural stories expressed in music, epic, and\ndrama, gender roles and sexual practices, military participation, and\nso on, were features of the \u201cway of life\u201d which\nconstituted the politeia or \u201cconstitution\u201d in its\nbroadest sense (Lane 2014a, 59\u201362). This broadest sense was\ninitially most evident to the Athenians when they looked at the\npeculiar customs of Sparta, but Plato taught them to recognize that\ndemocratic Athens was as distinctive a regime (Schofield 2006:\n31\u201343), one embodying a particular set of ethical goals and\npractices in its political arrangements.\n\nMost of those generally recognized as \u201cwise men\u201d\n(sophoi) and \u201cstudents of nature\u201d\n(physikoi) who appeared in this milieu, thought within the\nsame broad terms as the poets and orators. Justice was widely, if not\nuniversally, treated as a fundamental constituent of cosmic order.\nSome of the physikoi influenced political life, notably a\nnumber of the Pythagoreans in southern Italy. Others held themselves\naloof from political action while still identifying commonalities or\nconsonances between nature and politics, for example, Democritus of\nAbdera, whose atomist philosophy comported with a defense of political\nlife, and so of the justice that it required individuals to enact, as\nbeing necessary for individual flourishing (see e.g. Democritus\u2019\nfragment DK B252 = Taylor D116). However, these portraits of broad\nconsonance between nature and politics were challenged in the mid to\nlate fifth century BCE by some among a new breed of thinker and actor,\nthe professional teachers (\u201csophists\u201d), who began to ask\nwhether the laws and customs (nomos, singular;\nnomoi, plural) embodying political justice were truly a\nreflection of justice in nature (phusis), or merely an\nimposition of arbitrary human norms. Most of the sophists argued the\nlatter, though they did so along a spectrum of interpretation (for\nwhich our evidence rests heavily on Plato, who portrays Socrates\narguing with a considerable number of sophists): for example, for\nProtagoras (an itinerant teacher from Abdera who is depicted in\nPlato\u2019s Protagoras and Theaetetus), the human\ncreation of political life was a cause of celebrating human virtues\nand practical abilities; whereas for Thrasymachus (an ambassador to\nAthens from Chalcedon, a city in Asia Minor near modern Istanbul, who\nis depicted in Plato\u2019s Republic), it was a cause of\ncondemnation, the powerful in any city imposing laws to serve their\nown advantage. In addition to the question of how laws fit into the\nnatural order, many sophists raised the question of whom the laws\nbenefited: were laws a socially and individually useful set of\nrestrictions on bad behavior, as some including Antiphon and an author\nknown today as the Anonymous Iamblichi seemed to think? Were\nthey the exploitative impositions of the strong on the week, as Plato\nhad his character Thrasymachus argue? Or were they the means by which\nthe many tamed and controlled the naturally powerful, preventing the\nlatter from using their strength for their own profit, as Plato had\nhis character Callicles argue? (See the entry on Callicles and\nThrasymachus.) These varied dimensions of the\nnomos-phusis debate raised challenges for the\ngoverning intellectual assumptions of the polis, even though\nthe sophists advertised themselves as teaching skills for success\nwithin it, a number of them being employed as diplomats by cities\neager to exploit their rhetorical abilities. Socrates and Plato would\nrespond to this challenge in shaping a new genre of\n\u201cphilosophy\u201d which broke the mould of their predecessors\n(on the genre of philosophy, see Nightingale 1993a). While it is\nbroadly true to say that Greek political thinkers generally\npresupposed the importance of justice, in the fifth and fourth\ncenturies BCE many of them also increasingly problematized it.\n",
