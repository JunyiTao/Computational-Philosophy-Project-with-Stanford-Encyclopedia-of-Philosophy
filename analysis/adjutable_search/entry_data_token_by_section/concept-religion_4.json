Reflexivity, Reference, and Skepticism\n\nOver the past forty years or so, there has been a reflexive turn in\nthe social sciences and humanities as scholars have pulled the camera\nback, so to speak, to examine the constructed nature of the objects\npreviously taken for granted as unproblematically \u201cthere\u201d.\nReflexive scholars have argued that the fact that what counts as\nreligion shifts according to one\u2019s definition reflects an\narbitrariness in the use of the term. They argue that the fact that\nreligion is not a concept found in all cultures but rather a\ntool invented at a certain time and place, by certain people for their\nown purposes, and then imposed on others, reveals its political\ncharacter. The perception that religion is a politically\nmotivated conceptual invention has therefore led some to skepticism\nabout whether the concept picks out something real in the world. As\nwith instrumentalism in philosophy of science, then, reflection on\nreligion has raised doubts about the ontological status of\nthe referent of one\u2019s technical term.\n\nA watershed text for the reflexive turn regarding the concept\nreligion is Jonathan Z. Smith\u2019s Imagining\nReligion (1982). Smith engages simultaneously in comparing\nreligions and in analyzing the scholarly practice of comparison. A\ncentral theme of his essays is that the concept religion (and\nsubcategories such as world religions, Abrahamic\nfaiths, or nonliterate traditions) are not scientific\nterms but often reflect the unrecognized biases of those who use these\nconcepts to sort their world into those who are or are not \u201clike\n us\u201d.[16]\n Smith shows that, again and again, the concept religion was\nshaped by implicit Protestant assumptions, if not explicit Protestant\napologetics. In the short preface to that book, Smith famously\nsays,\n\n\n[T]here is no data for religion. Religion is solely\nthe creation of the scholar\u2019s study. It is created for the\nscholar\u2019s analytic purposes by his imaginative acts of\ncomparison and generalization. Religion has no independent existence\napart from the academy. (1982: xi, italics in original)\n\n\nThis dramatic statement has sometimes been taken as Smith\u2019s\nassertion that the concept religion has no referent. However,\nin his actual practice of comparing societies, Smith is not a\nnonrealist about religion. In the first place, he did not\nthink that the constructed nature of religion was something\nparticular to this concept: any judgement that two things\nwere similar or different in some respect presupposed a process of\nselection, juxtaposition, and categorization by the observer. This is\nthe process of imagination in his book\u2019s title. Second, Smith\ndid not think that the fact that concepts were human products\nundermined the possibility that they successfully corresponded to\nentities in the world: an invented concept for social structures can\nhelp one discover religion\u2014not \u201cinvent\u201d\nit\u2014even in societies whose members did not know the\n concept.[17]\n His slogan is that one\u2019s (conceptual) map is not the same as\nand should be tested and rectified by the (non-conceptual) territory\n(J. Z. Smith 1978). Lastly, Smith did not think that scholars should\ncease to use religion as a redescriptive or second-order\ncategory to study people in history who lacked a comparable concept.\nOn the contrary, he chastised scholars of religion for resting within\ntradition-specific studies, avoiding cross-cultural comparisons, and\nnot defending the coherence of the generic concept. He writes that\nscholars of religion should be\n\n\nprepared to insist, in some explicit and coherent fashion, on the\npriority of some generic category of religion. (1995: 412; cf. 1998:\n281\u20132)\n\n\nSmith himself repeatedly uses religion and related technical\nterms he invented, such as \u201clocative religion\u201d, to\nilluminate social structures that operate whether or not those so\ndescribed had named those structures themselves\u2014social\nstructures that exist, as his 1982 subtitle says, from Babylon to\nJonestown.\n\nThe second most influential book in the reflexive turn in religious\nstudies is Talal Asad\u2019s Genealogies of Religion (1993).\nAdopting Michel Foucault\u2019s \u201cgenealogical\u201d approach,\nAsad seeks to show that the concept religion operating in\ncontemporary anthropology has been shaped by assumptions that are\nChristian (insofar as one takes belief as a mental state\ncharacteristic of all religions) and modern (insofar as one treats\nreligion as essentially distinct from politics). Asad\u2019s\nFoucauldian point is that though people may have all kinds of\nreligious beliefs, experiences, moods, or motivations, the mechanism\nthat inculcates them will be the disciplining techniques of some\nauthorizing power and for this reason one cannot treat religion as\nsimply inner states. Like Smith, then, Asad asks scholars to shift\ntheir attention to the concept religion and to recognize that\nassumptions baked into the concept have distorted our grasp of the\nhistorical realities. However, also like Smith, Asad does not draw a\nnonrealist\n conclusion.[18]\n For Asad, religion names a real thing that would operate in\nthe world even had the concept not been invented, namely, \u201ca\ncoherent existential complex\u201d (2001: 217). Asad\u2019s critical\naim is not to undermine the idea that religion exists qua social\nreality but rather to undermine the idea that religion is essentially\nan interior state independent of social power. He points out that\nanthropologists like Clifford Geertz adopt a hermeneutic approach to\nculture that treats actions as if they are texts that say something,\nand this approach has reinforced the attention given to the meaning of\nreligious symbols, deracinated from their social and historical\ncontext. Asad seeks to balance this bias for the subjective with a\ndisciplinary approach that sees human subjectivity as also the product\nof social structures. Smith and Asad are therefore examples of\nscholars who critique the concept religion without denying\nthat it can still refer to something in the world, something that\nexists even before it is named. They are able, so to speak, to look at\none\u2019s conceptual window without denying that the window provides\na perspective on things outside.\n\nOther critics have gone farther. They build upon the claims that the\nconcept religion is an invented category and that its modern\nsemantic expansion went hand in hand with European colonialism, and\nthey argue that people should cease treating religion as if\nit corresponds to something that exists outside the sphere of modern\nEuropean influence. It is common today to hear the slogan that there\nis no such \u201cthing\u201d as religion. In some cases, the point\nof rejecting thing-hood is to deny that religion names a\ncategory, all the instances of which focus on belief in the same kind\nof object\u2014that is, the slogan is a rejection of substantive\ndefinitions of the concept (e.g., Possamai 2018: ch. 5). In this case,\nthe objection bolsters a functional definition and does not deny that\nreligion corresponds to a functionally distinct kind of form\nof life. Here, the \u201cno such thing\u201d claim reflects the\nunsettled question, mentioned above, about the grounds of substantive\ndefinitions of \u201creligion\u201d. In other cases, the point of\nthis objection is to deny that religion names a defining\ncharacteristic of any kind\u2014that is, the slogan is a rejection of\nall monothetic definitions of the concept. Perhaps religion\n(or a religion, like Judaism) should always be referred to in the\nplural (\u201cJudaisms\u201d) rather than the singular. In this\ncase, the objection bolsters a polythetic definition and does not deny\nthat religion corresponds to a distinct family of forms of\nlife. Here, the \u201cno such thing\u201d claim rejects the\nassumption that religion has an essence. Despite their negativity,\nthese two objections to the concept are still realist in that they do\nnot deny that the phrase \u201ca religion\u201d can correspond to a\nform of life operating in the world.\n\nMore radically, one sees a denial of this realism, for example, in the\ncritique offered by Wilfred Cantwell Smith (1962). Smith\u2019s\nthesis is that in many different cultures, people developed a concept\nfor the individuals they considered pious, but they did not develop a\nconcept for a generic social entity, a system of beliefs and practices\nrelated to superempirical realities. Before modernity, \u201cthere is\nno such entity [as religion and] \u2026 the use of a plural, or with\nan article, is false\u201d (1962: 326, 194; cf. 144). Smith\nrecommends dropping religion. Not only did those so described\nlack the concept, but the use of the concept also treats\npeople\u2019s behavior as if the phrase \u201ca religion\u201d\nnames something in addition to that behavior. A methodological\nindividualist, Smith denies that groups have any reality not explained\nby the individuals who constitute them. What one finds in history,\nthen, is religious people, and so the adjective is useful,\nbut there are no religious entities above and beyond those people, and\nso the noun reifies an abstraction. Smith contends that\n\n\n[n]either religion in general nor any one of the religions \u2026 is\nin itself an intelligible entity, a valid object of inquiry or of\nconcern either for the scholar or for the [person] of faith. (1962:\n12)\n\n\nMore radical still are the nonrealists who argue that the concepts\nreligion, religions, and religious are all\nchimerical. Often drawing on post-structuralist arguments, these\ncritics propose that the notion that religions exist is simply an\nillusion generated by the discourse about them (e.g., McCutcheon 1997;\n2018; Fitzgerald 2000; 2007; 2017; Dubuisson 1998; 2019). As Timothy\nFitzgerald writes, the concept religion\n\n\npicks out nothing and it clarifies nothing \u2026 the word has no\ngenuine analytical work to do and its continued use merely contributes\nto the general illusion that it has a genuine referent \u2026.\n(2000: 17, 14; also 4)\n\n\nAdvocates of this position sometimes call their approach the\n\u201cCritical Study of Religion\u201d or simply \u201cCritical\nReligion\u201d, a name that signals their shift away from the\npre-critical assumption that religion names entities in the\nworld and to a focus on who invented the concept, the shifting\ncontrast terms it has had, and the uses to which it has been\n put.[19]\n Like the concept of witches or the concept of biological races (e.g.,\nNye 2020), religion is a fiction (Fitzgerald 2015) or a\nfabrication (McCutcheon 2018), a concept invented and deployed not to\nrespond to some reality in the world but rather to sort and control\npeople. The classification of something as \u201creligion\u201d is\nnot neutral but\n\n\na political activity, and one particularly related to the colonial and\nimperial situation of a foreign power rendering newly encountered\nsocieties digestible and manipulable in terms congenial to its own\nculture and agenda. (McCutcheon & Arnal 2012: 107)\n\n\nAs part of European colonial projects, the concept has been imposed on\npeople who lacked it and did not consider anything in their society\n\u201ctheir religion\u201d. In fact, the concept was for centuries\nthe central tool used to rank societies on a scale from primitive to\ncivilized. To avoid this \u201cconceptual violence\u201d or\n\u201cepistemic imperialism\u201d (Dubuisson 2019: 137), scholars\nneed to cease naturalizing this term invented in modern Europe and\ninstead historicize it, uncovering the conditions that gave rise to\nthe concept and the interests it serves. The study of religions\noutside Europe should end. As Timothy Fitzgerald writes, \u201cThe\ncategory \u2018religion\u2019 should be the object, not the tool, of\nanalysis\u201d (2000: 106; also 2017: 125; cf. McCutcheon 2018:\n18).\n\nInspired by the post-structuralist critiques that religion\ndoes not apply to cultures that lack the concept, some historians have\nargued that the term should no longer be used to describe any\npremodern societies, even in Europe. For example, Brent Nongbri\n(2013), citing McCutcheon, argues that though it is common to speak of\nreligions existing in the past, human history until the concept\nemerged in modernity is more accurately understood as a time\n\u201cbefore religion\u201d. His aim is \u201cto dispel the\ncommonly held idea that there is such a thing as \u2018ancient\nreligion\u2019\u201d (2013: 8). Citing Nongbri, Carlin Barton and\nDaniel Boyarin (2016) argue that the Latin religio and the\nGreek thr\u0113skeia do not correspond to the modern\nunderstanding of religion and those studying antiquity should\ncease translating them with that concept. There was no \u201cRoman\nreligious reality\u201d, they say (2016: 19). These historians\nsuggest that if a culture does not have the concept of X,\nthen the reality of X does not exist for that culture.\nBoyarin calls this position \u201cnominalism\u201d, arguing that\nreligion is\n\n\nnot in any possible way a \u201creal\u201d object, an object that is\nhistorical or ontological, before the term comes to be used. (2017:\n25)\n\n\nThese critics are right to draw attention to the fact that in the mind\nof most contemporary people, the concept religion does imply\nfeatures that did not exist in ancient societies, but the argument\nthat religion did not exist in antiquity involves a sleight of hand.\nNone of these historians argues that people in antiquity did not\nbelieve in gods or other spiritual beings, did not seek to interact\nwith them with sacrifices and other rituals, did not create temples or\nscriptures, and so on. If one uses Tylor\u2019s definition of\nreligion as belief in spiritual beings or James\u2019s\ndefinition of religion as adjusting one\u2019s life to an\nunseen order\u2014or any of the other definitions considered in\nthis entry\u2014then religion did exist in antiquity.\nWhat these historians are pointing out is that ancient practices\nrelated to the gods permeated their cultures. As Nongbri puts\nit,\n\n\nTo be sure, ancient people had words to describe proper reverence of\nthe gods, but \u2026 [t]he very idea of \u201cbeing\nreligious\u201d requires a companion notion of what it would mean to\nbe \u201cnot religious\u201d and this dichotomy was not part of the\nancient world; (2013: 4)\n\n\nthere was no \u201cdiscrete sphere of religion existing prior to the\nmodern period\u201d (2019: 1, typo corrected). And Barton and\nBoyarin:\n\n\nThe point is not \u2026 that there weren\u2019t practices with\nrespect to \u201cgods\u201d (of whatever sort) but that these\npractices were not divided off into separate spheres \u2026. (2016:\n4)\n\n\nSteve Mason also argues that religion did not exist in antiquity since\nreligion is \u201ca voluntary sphere of activity, separate in\nprinciple\u201d from politics, work, entertainment, and military\nservice (2019: 29). In short, what people later came to conceptualize\nas religion was in antiquity not a freestanding entity. The nominalist\nargument, in other words, adds to the definition of the concept\nreligion a distinctively modern feature (usually some version\nof \u201cthe separation of church and state\u201d), and then argues\nthat the referent of this now-circumscribed concept did not exist in\nantiquity. Their argument is not that religion did not exist outside\nmodernity, but that modern religion did not exist outside\nmodernity.\n\nThese post-structuralist and nominalist arguments that deny that\nreligion is \u201cout there\u201d have a realist alternative.\nAccording to this alternative, there is a world independent of human\nconceptualization, and something can be real and it can even affect\none\u2019s life, whether or not any human beings have identified it.\nThis is true of things whose existence does not depend on collective\nagreement, like biochemical signaling cascades or radioactive beta\nparticles, and it is equally true of things whose existence does\ndepend on collective agreement, like kinship structures, linguistic\nrules, and religious commitments. A realist about social structures\nholds that a person can be in a bilateral kinship system, can speak a\nUralic language, and can be a member of a religion\u2014even if they\nlack these concepts.\n\nThis realist claim that social structures have existed without being\nconceptualized raises the question: if human beings had different ways\nof practicing religion since prehistoric times, why and when did\npeople \u201cfinally\u201d create the taxon? Almost every scholar\ninvolved in the reflexive turn says that religion is a modern\n invention.[20]\n The critique of the concept religion then becomes part of\ntheir critique of modernity. Given the potent uses of\nreligion\u2014to categorize certain cultures as godless and\ntherefore inferior or, later, to categorize certain cultures as\nsuperstitious and therefore backwards\u2014the significance of the\ncritique of religion for postcolonial and decolonial\nscholarship is undeniable. Nevertheless, it is not plausible that\nmodern Europeans were the first to want a generic concept for\ndifferent ways of interacting with gods. It is easy to imagine that if\nthe way that a people worship their gods permeates their work, art,\nand politics, and they do not know of alternative ways, then it would\nnot be likely that they would have created a concept for it. There is\nlittle need for a generic concept that abstracts a particular aspect\nof one\u2019s culture as one option out of many until one is in a\nsustained pluralistic situation. The actions that today are\ncategorized as religious practices\u2014burial rites, the making of\nofferings, the imitation of divinized ancestors\u2014may have existed\nfor tens of thousands of years without the practitioners experiencing\nthat diversity or caring to name it. Nevertheless, it is likely that a\ndesire to compare the rules by which different people live in relation\nto their gods would have emerged in many parts of the world long\nbefore modernity. One would expect to find people developing such\nsocial abstractions as cities and then empires emerged and their\ncultures came into contact with each other. From this realist\nperspective, it is no surprise that, according to the detailed and\nexample-filled argument of Barton and Boyarin (2016), the first use of\nreligion as a generic social category, distinct from the\nconcept of politics, for the ways that people interact with\ngods is not a product of the Renaissance, the Reformation, or modern\ncolonialism at all, but can be found in the writings of Josephus\n(37\u2013c. 100 CE) and Tertullian (c. 155\u2013c. 220\n CE).[21]\n From the realist perspective, it is no surprise to see the\ndevelopment of analogous terms in medieval China, centuries before\ninteraction with Europeans (Campany 2003, 2012, 2018) and in medieval\nIslam (Abbasi 2020, 2021). The emergence of social kinds does not wait\non language, and the development of language for social kinds is not\nonly a Western project. If this is right, then the development of a\nconcept for\u00a0religion as a social genus is at least two thousand\nyears old, though the social reality so labeled would be much\nolder.\n",
