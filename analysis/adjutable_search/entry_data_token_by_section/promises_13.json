    "main_text": "Interpersonal Commitments || Joint Commitment\n4.1 Joint Commitment\n\nGilbert\u2019s theory, sketched in her \u201cThree Dogmas about\nPromising\u201d (2011) makes promissory obligations a matter of\n\u201cjoint commitment\u201d, jointly made by two or more parties.\nWhereas a personal decision is a personal commitment, a promise is a\njoint commitment of promisor and promisee. More fully a promise is a\njoint commitment to endorse as a body a plan such that one person (the\npromisor) do such and such, where a joint commitment is not composed\nof two or more personal commitment (in Gilbert's sense) though each of\nthe parties is committed through it:\n\n\nA joint commitment is not a composite of two or more personal\ncommitments. It is a commitment of two or more persons by two or more\npersons. [. . . .]\u00a0 In order to create a new joint commitment\neach of the would-be parties must openly express to the others his\nreadiness together with the others to commit them all in the pertinent\nway. Once these expressions are common knowledge between the parties,\nthe joint commitment is in place\u2014as they understand. Each is\ntherefore now committed to do what he can to promote satisfaction of\nthe joint commitment in conjunction with the actions of the rest.\n(Gilbert 2011: 92\u20133)\n\n\nGilbert\u2019s work has spurred a number of commentators, and there\nis a vibrant sub-literature on her theories and related matters, see\nSheehy (2002), Carassa & Colombetti, (2014), Melenovsky (2017),\nHelmreich (2018), Kenessey (2020, among others\n",
