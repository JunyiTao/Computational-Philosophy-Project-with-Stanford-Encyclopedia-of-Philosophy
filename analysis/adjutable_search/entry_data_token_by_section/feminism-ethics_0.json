    "main_text": "Feminist Ethics: Historical Background\n1. Feminist Ethics: Historical Background\n\nFeminist ethics as an academic area of study in the field of\nphilosophy dates to the 1970s, when philosophical journals started\nmore frequently publishing articles specifically concerned with\nfeminism and sexism (Korsmeyer 1973; Rosenthal 1973; Jaggar 1974), and\nafter curricular programs of Women\u2019s Studies began to be\nestablished in some universities (Young 1977; Tuana 2011). Readers\ninterested in themes evident in the fifty years of feminist ethics in\nphilosophy will find this discussion in section (2) below,\n\u201cThemes in Feminist Ethics.\u201d\n\nPrior to 1970, \u201cthere was no recognized body of feminist\nphilosophy\u201d (Card 2008, 90). Of course, throughout history,\nphilosophers have attempted to understand the roles that gender may\nplay in moral life. Yet such philosophers presumably were addressing\nmale readers, and their accounts of women\u2019s moral capacities did\nnot usually aim to disrupt the subordination of women. Rarely in the\nhistory of philosophy will one find philosophical works that notice\ngender in order to criticize and correct men\u2019s historical\nprivileges or to disrupt the social orders and practices that\nsubordinate groups on gendered dimensions. An understanding that sex\nmatters to one\u2019s ethical theorizing in some way is necessary to,\nbut not sufficient for, feminist ethics.\n\nSome philosophers and writers in almost every century, however,\nconstitute forerunners to feminist ethics. Representative authors\nwriting in the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries\ndiscussed below explicitly address what they perceive to be moral\nwrongs resulting from either oppression on the basis of sex, or\nmetaethical errors on the part of public intellectuals in believing\nideal forms of moral reasoning to be within the capacities of men and\nnot women. In the early-to-mid-twentieth century, at the same time\nthat feminism became a more popularly used term in Europe and\nthe Americas, more theorists argued influentially for ending unjust\ndiscrimination on the basis of sex. Some authors concertedly argued\nthat philosophers and theorists erred in their understanding of what\nseemed to be gendered differences in ethical and moral reasoning.\n",
