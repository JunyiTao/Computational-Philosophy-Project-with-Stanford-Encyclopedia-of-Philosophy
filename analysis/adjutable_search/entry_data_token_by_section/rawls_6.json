Political Liberalism: Legitimacy and Stability within a Liberal Society\n\nIn a free society, citizens will have disparate worldviews. They will\nbelieve in different religions or none at all; they will have\ndiffering conceptions of right and wrong; they will disagree on how to\nlive and on what relationships to value. Citizens will have contrary\ncommitments, yet within any country there can only be one law. The law\nmust either establish a national church, or not; women must either\nhave equal rights, or not; abortion and gay marriage must either be\npermissible, or not; the economy must be set up in one way or\nanother.\n\nRawls holds that the need to impose a unified law on a diverse\ncitizenry raises two fundamental challenges. The first is the\nchallenge of legitimacy: the legitimate use of coercive\npolitical power. How can it be legitimate to coerce all citizens to\nfollow just one law, given that citizens will inevitably hold\ndivergent worldviews?\n\nThe second challenge is the challenge of stability, which\nlooks at political power from the receiving end. Why would a citizen\nwillingly obey a law that is imposed on her by a collective body whose\nmembers have beliefs and values so different to her own? Yet unless\nmost citizens willingly obey the law, no social order can be stable\nfor long.\n\nRawls answers these challenges of legitimacy and stability with his\ntheory of political liberalism. Political liberalism is not\nyet Rawls\u2019s theory of justice (justice as fairness). Political\nliberalism answers the conceptually prior questions of legitimacy and\nstability, so fixing the context and starting points for justice as\nfairness.\n",
