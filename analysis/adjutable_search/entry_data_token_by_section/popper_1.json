    "main_text": "Backdrop to Popper\u2019s Thought\n2. Backdrop to Popper\u2019s Thought\n\nA number of biographical features may be identified as having a\nparticular influence upon Popper\u2019s thought. His teenage\nflirtation with Marxism left him thoroughly familiar with the Marxian\ndialectical view of economics, class-war, and history. But he was\nappalled by the failure of the democratic parties to stem the rising\ntide of fascism in Austria in the 1920s and 1930s, and the effective\nwelcome extended to it by the Marxists, who regarded fascism as a\nnecessary dialectical step towards the implosion of capitalism and the\nultimate victory of communism. The Poverty of Historicism\n(1944; 1957) and The Open Society and Its Enemies (1945),\nPopper\u2019s most impassioned and influential social works, are\npowerful defences of democratic liberalism, and strident critiques of\nphilosophical presuppositions underpinning all forms of\ntotalitarianism.\n\nPopper was also profoundly impressed by the differences between the\nallegedly \u201cscientific\u201d theories of Freud and Adler and the\nrevolution effected by Einstein\u2019s theory of Relativity in\nphysics in the first two decades of the twentieth century. The main\ndifference between them, as Popper saw it, was that while\nEinstein\u2019s theory was highly \u201crisky\u201d, in the sense\nthat it was possible to deduce consequences from it which were, in the\nlight of the then dominant Newtonian physics, highly improbable (e.g.,\nthat light is deflected towards solid bodies\u2014confirmed by\nEddington\u2019s experiments in 1919), and which would, if they\nturned out to be false, falsify the whole theory, nothing could, even\nin principle, falsify psychoanalytic theories. They were,\nPopper argues, \u201csimply non-testable, irrefutable. There was no\nconceivable human behaviour which could contradict them\u201d (1963:\n37). As such, they have more in common with myths than with genuine\nscience; \u201cThey contain most interesting psychological\nsuggestions, but not in a testable form\u201d (1963: 38). What is\napparently the chief source of strength of psychoanalysis, he\nconcluded, viz. its capability to accommodate and explain every\npossible form of human behaviour, is in fact a critical weakness, for\nit entails that it is not, and could not be, genuinely predictive. To\nthose who would respond that psychoanalytic theory is supported by\nclinical observations, Popper points out that\n\n\n\u2026 real support can be obtained only from observations\nundertaken as tests (by \u2018attempted refutations\u2019); and for\nthis purpose criteria of refutation have to be laid down\nbeforehand: it must be agree which observable situations, if actually\nobserved, mean that the theory is refuted. (1963: 38, footnote 3)\n\n\nPopper also considers that contemporary Marxism also lacks scientific\nstatus. Unlike psychoanalysis, he argues, Marxism had been initially\nscientific, in that it was genuinely predictive. However, when these\npredictions were not in fact borne out, the theory was saved from\nfalsification by the addition of ad hoc hypotheses which made\nit compatible with the facts. By this means, Popper asserts, a theory\nwhich was initially genuinely scientific degenerated into\npseudo-scientific dogma. As he sees it, the Hegelian dialectic was\nadopted by Marxists not to oppose dogmatism but to accommodate it to\ntheir cause by eliminating the possibility of contradictory evidence.\nIt has thus become what Popper terms \u201creinforced\ndogmatism\u201d (1963: 334).\n\nThese factors combined to make Popper take falsifiability as\nhis criterion for demarcating science from non-science: if a theory is\nincompatible with possible empirical observations it is scientific;\nconversely, a theory which is compatible with all such observations,\neither because, as in the case of Marxism, it has been modified solely\nto accommodate such observations, or because, as in the case of\npsychoanalytic theories, it is consistent with all possible\nobservations, is unscientific. However, Popper is not a positivist and\nacknowledges that unscientific theories may be enlightening and that\neven purely mythogenic explanations have performed a valuable function\nin the past in expediting our understanding of the nature of\nreality.\n",
