    "main_text": "Jus ad Bellum || Just Peace\n3.2 Just Peace\n\nThe goods and bads relevant to ad bellum proportionality and\nnecessity extend far beyond the armistice. This is obvious, but has\nrecently received much-needed emphasis, both among philosophers and in\nthe broader public debate sparked by the conflicts in Iraq and\nAfghanistan (Bass 2004; Coady 2008; May 2012). Achieving your just\ncause is not enough. The aftermath of the war must also be\nsufficiently tolerable if the war is to be proportionate, all things\nconsidered. It is an open question how far into the future we have to\nlook to assess the morally relevant consequences of conflict.\n",
