    "main_text": "Justice and Domestic Health Inequalities || Derivative Approaches\n6.3 Derivative Approaches\n\nIn contrast to free-standing approaches to the justice of health\ninequalities, derivative approaches locate the injustice of unjust\nhealth inequalities with their unjust causes. Norman Daniels (2008)\noffers the most prominent example of this approach (see also Daniels,\nKennedy, & Kawachi 2000; and Peter 2004). His central claim is\nthat, by a happy coincidence, John Rawls\u2019 principles of justice\nregulate all of the principal social determinants of health (Daniels\n2008: 82 and 97). Compliance with these principles, Daniels (2008: 82)\nclaims, \u201cwill consequently flatten the socioeconomic gradient of\nhealth as much as we can reasonably demand\u201d with the result that\n\u201csocial justice in general is good for population health and\nits fair distribution\u201d.\n\nTo begin with, income and workplace organization are\nregulated by the difference principle: inequalities in income and\nhierarchies in the workplace are permitted only to the extent that\nthey work to the greatest benefit of the least well off.\nEducation is regulated by the principle of fair equality of\nopportunity, which requires \u201cequitable public education\u201d\nas well as \u201cdevelopmentally appropriate day care and early\nchildhood interventions\u201d (Daniels 2008: 96). Political\nparticipation, which Daniels (2008: 95\u20136) regards as a\nsocial determinant of health, is regulated by the principle of equal\nbasic liberty: among other things, this principle safeguards the fair\nvalue of the right to participate politically. Finally, reaffirming\nhis earlier work (1985), Daniels maintains that fair equality of\nopportunity also requires universal access to comprehensive health\ncare (broadly construed to include public health).\n\nTo the extent that these social variables are causal determinants of\nhealth, and to the extent that their distribution in society\nfails to conform to the corresponding principle of Rawlsian\njustice, the resultant health inequalities will be unjust and unjust\nbecause their causes are unjust. The flip-side of this point is that\nthe implementation of Rawls\u2019 principles will tend\u2014again,\ninsofar as the relevant determinants are causal\u2014to reduce\nexisting inequalities in health (Daniels 2008: 82).\n\nAs Daniels notices, observing Rawlsian justice may flatten the social\ngradient in health without eliminating it altogether. For example, the\ndifference principle may permit certain inequalities of income, which\nare nevertheless possible to eliminate. If income is a causal\ndeterminant of health, these permissible income inequalities will\n(continue to) generate health inequalities if they are left in place.\n(This scenario is actually only coherent if the relative\nincome hypothesis is the correct account of the causal mechanism. For\nthe explanation, see Sreenivasan 2009b). Daniels holds that the\npersistence of avoidable health inequalities does not give us reason\nin justice, independently of the difference principle, to eliminate\ntheir underlying cause. In his view, justice permits some avoidable\ninequalities in health:\n\n\nThe residual inequalities that emerge with conformance to\n[Rawls\u2019] principles are not a compromise with what justice\nideally requires; they are acceptable as just. (2008: 99)\n\n\nAnand and Peter (2000) criticize Daniels\u2019 account on the grounds\nthat there is a tension between two different uses Daniels makes of\nRawls\u2019 second principle of justice. On the one hand, they argue,\nDaniels treats its two parts as simply regulating certain specific\nsocial determinants of health\u2014the fair equality of opportunity\nprinciple regulates education (e.g.), while the difference principle\nregulates income. On the other hand, his account of health care treats\nthe fair equality of opportunity principle as regulating\nhealth itself directly. But the latter employment of fair\nequality of opportunity, which Anand and Peter actually prefer (2000:\n52), threatens to contradict Daniels\u2019 treatment of residual\nhealth inequalities. If fair equality of opportunity requires (some\nkind of) egalitarianism about health, then residual health\ninequalities that remain after the difference principle is fully\nimplemented may still fall within its scope. In that case,\nRawlsian justice may well command their reduction.\n\nTo avoid this problem of inconsistency, Jayna Fishman and Douglas\nMacKay (2019) and Johannes Kniess (2019) rework Rawls\u2019s theory\nof justice, developing a Rawlsian conception of the social\ndeterminants of health\u2014the social bases of\nhealth\u2014and arguing that it should be considered a social\nprimary good. Fishman and MacKay (2019) and Kniess (2019) disagree\nhowever on which Rawlsian principle should govern the distribution of\nthis good. Fishman and MacKay (2019) argue that the parties to the\noriginal position would choose an additional principle of justice to\ngovern the distribution of the social bases of health and assign it\nlexical priority over fair equality of opportunity and the difference\nprinciple. According to this principle, the\n\n\nsocial bases of health are to be arranged so as to have the greatest\npositive impact on the health status of those least advantaged on the\nsocial health gradient. (Fishman & MacKay 2019: 616)\n\n\nThe social bases of health deserve this priority, Fishman and MacKay\n(2019: 615) suggest, since health is necessary if people are to\nrealize their highest order interests in developing and exercising\ntheir two moral powers. Inequalities in the distribution of the social\nbases of health, and so inequalities in health status resulting from\nsuch a distribution, are just if the least advantaged on the social\nhealth gradient have a higher expected health status than they would\nunder an equal distribution (Fishman & MacKay 2019: 616). Kniess\n(2019: 418), by contrast, argues that the social bases of health\nshould be governed by the difference principle, though he concedes\nthat this complicates the indexing problem, namely, that there is no\nobvious way to rank different distributions of income and wealth, the\npowers and prerogatives of offices and positions of responsibility,\nand the social bases of health. Kniess (2019: 420) concludes that such\ntradeoffs must be decided through the democratic process. While\nFishman and MacKay (2019) avoid this problem by prioritizing the\nsocial bases of health, as Kniess argues (2019: 418\u2013420), his\napproach may be preferable since it permits tradeoffs between health\nand income and also leaves more room for political communities to set\npriorities.\n\nOne remaining problem with Fishman and MacKay (2019) and\nKniess\u2019s (2019) reworking of Daniels\u2019 (2008) approach is\nthat they too are silent on the justice of residual health\ninequalities. This question is important, for while we have presented\nthe free-standing and derivative approaches as alternatives, it is\npossible for the two approaches to be combined. Holding that\ninequalities in health are unjust because of their unjust causes does\nnot preclude holding that they are unjust simply qua inequalities.\n",
