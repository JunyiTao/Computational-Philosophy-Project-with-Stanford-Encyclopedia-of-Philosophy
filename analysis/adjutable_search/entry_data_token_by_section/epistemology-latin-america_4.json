    "main_text": "Wittgenstein: Epistemology and Skepticism\n5. Wittgenstein: Epistemology and Skepticism\n\nAnother line of epistemological research in Latin America concerns\nLudwig Wittgenstein\u2019s thought. The first scholar to be mentioned\nis Alejandro Tomasini Bassols (b. 1952). A member of the Instituto de\nInvestigaciones Filos\u00f3ficas at the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma\nde M\u00e9xico, he has devoted a considerable part of his work to\ninterpreting Wittgenstein\u2019s thought and endorses what he\ndescribes as \u201ca radical Wittgensteinism\u201d. Although from\nthe vantage point of the numerous Anglophone specialists on\nWittgenstein his writings might not offer original insights, they have\ncontributed to the dissemination of the Austrian philosopher\u2019s\nthought in the Spanish-speaking world. In his 2001 book, Tomasini\nBassols examines the concept of knowledge, the problem of skepticism,\nand various issues concerning perception, memory, self-knowledge,\npersonal identity, and truth by contrasting the\n\u201cclassical\u201d and the Wittgensteinian approaches to each of\nthose questions. Availing himself primarily of the epistemological\nconsiderations found in On Certainty, his main contention is\nthat the type of grammatical analysis proposed by Wittgenstein shows\nthat the traditional problems that classical epistemology intended to\nsolve through the construction of elaborate theories are nothing but\npseudo-problems arising from conceptual misunderstandings. For this\nreason, he contends, it is no longer possible to continue to practice\nepistemology the way it was practiced before Wittgenstein.\n\nIn Colombia, one finds several scholars interested in\nWittgenstein\u2019s philosophy, among whom one should mention\nMagdalena Holgu\u00edn (b. 1950) and Ra\u00fal Mel\u00e9ndez (b.\n1964). Holgu\u00edn obtained her B.A. and M.A. in philosophy from\nGeorgetown University, her M.A. in law from the Universidad de los\nAndes (Colombia), and her Ph.D. in philosophy from Columbia\nUniversity. She taught at the Universidad de los Andes and the\nUniversidad Nacional de Colombia. In her short 1997 book, she explores\nWittgenstein\u2019s stance on certain skeptical problems. After\npresenting Wittgenstein\u2019s view that philosophy is not a theory\nor a doctrine but an activity, as well as the changes in his\nconception of philosophy over the different phases of his thought,\nHolgu\u00edn examines the distinction between appearance and\nreality, the distinction between subjective and objective, and the\nidea, shared by skeptics and dogmatists but rejected by Wittgenstein\nas being based on confusion, that knowledge requires an ultimate\nfoundation. (It should be noted that skeptics of a Pyrrhonian stripe\nsuspend judgment about whether knowledge requires an ultimate\nfoundation.)\n\nMel\u00e9ndez is a professor at the Universidad Nacional de\nColombia, where he also obtained his Ph.D. in philosophy. In his 1998\nbook, he explores the notion of truth from the vantage point of\nWittgenstein\u2019s later philosophy, although he also takes into\naccount the conception of truth defended in the Tractatus.\nMel\u00e9ndez\u2019s main aim is to call into question the attempts\nto construct a general theory of truth that would make it rest on an\nultimate and unshakable foundation. In a later publication, he\ndiscusses Wittgenstein\u2019s examination of the notions of\njustification, persuasion, and world-picture (Weltbild) in\nOn Certainty, focusing on whether world-pictures are taken to\nbe incommensurable and hence on whether Wittgenstein endorses a form\nof epistemic relativism (Mel\u00e9ndez 2014).\n\nIt should finally be pointed out that in Brazil there has been some\ndiscussion of the philosophical connections between\nWittgenstein\u2019s thought and Pyrrhonian skepticism\u2014a\ncomparison first made, to the best of my knowledge, by Richard Watson\n(1969) and Robert Fogelin (1981). Pl\u00ednio Junqueira Smith (1993)\nhas claimed that there are strong similarities between\nWittgenstein\u2019s later philosophy and the Pyrrhonism expounded in\nSextus Empiricus\u2019s surviving works. For instance, according to\nSmith, both reject the conception of philosophy as a theory that\nprovides us with knowledge of the essence of things that lies beneath\ntheir surface, conceiving of it instead as an ability and a\ntherapeutic practice whose function is negative and critical.\nSmith\u2019s interpretation was later on called into question by\nPaulo Roberto Margutti Pinto\u2014currently a professor at the\nFaculdade Jesu\u00edta de Filosofia e Teologia\u2014who maintained\nthat, although there exist similarities, they are merely superficial\nwhile the differences are radical: e.g., while the Pyrrhonist accepts\nthat there are philosophical problems to be solved, Wittgenstein\ndissolves them by appealing to the way in which words are used in\nordinary language (Margutti Pinto 1996).\n",
