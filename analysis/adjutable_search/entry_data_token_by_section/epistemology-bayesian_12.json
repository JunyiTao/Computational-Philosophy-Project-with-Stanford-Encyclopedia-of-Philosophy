    "main_text": "Synchronic Norms (I): Requirements of Coherence || Versions of Probabilism\n3.1 Versions of Probabilism\n\nProbabilism is often stated as follows:\n\n\nProbabilism (Standard Version). One\u2019s\nassignment of credences ought to be probabilistic in this sense: it is\na probability measure.\n\n\n\nThis norm implies that one should have a credence in a logical truth\n(indeed, a credence of 1) and that, when one has credences in some\npropositions, one should also have credences in their\nconjunctions, disjunctions, and negations. So Probabilism in its\nstandard version asks one to have credences in certain propositions.\nBut that seems to be in tension with the fact that Probabilism is\noften understood as a coherence norm. To see why, note that\ncoherence is a matter of fitting things together nicely. So coherence\nis supposed to put a constraint on the combinations of attitudes that\none may have, without saying that one must have an attitude\ntoward such and such propositions\u2014contrary to the above version\nof Probabilism. If so, the right version of Probabilism must be weak\nenough to allow the absence of some credences, also called\ncredence gaps.\n\nThe above line of thought has led some Bayesians to develop and defend\na weaker version of Probabilism (de Finetti 1970 [1974], Jeffrey 1983,\nZynda 1996):\n\n\nProbabilism (Extensibility Version).\nOne\u2019s assignment of credences ought to be probabilistically\nextensible in this sense: either it is already a probability measure,\nor it can be turned into a probability measure by assigning new\ncredences to some more propositions without changing the existing\ncredences.\n\n\n\nIt is the second disjunct that allows credence gaps. De Finetti (1970\n[1974: sec. 3]) also argues that, when the Dutch Book argument for\nProbabilism is carefully examined, it can be seen to support only the\nextensibility version rather than the standard one. His idea is to\nadopt a liberal conception of betting dispositions: one is permitted\nto lack any betting disposition about a proposition, which in turn\npermits one to lack a credence in that proposition.\n\nThe above two versions of Probabilism are still similar in that they\nboth imply that any credence ought to be sharp\u2014being an\nindividual real number. But some Bayesians maintain that coherence\ndoes not require that much but allows credences to be unsharp\nin a certain sense. An even weaker version of Probabilism has been\ndeveloped accordingly, defended with a Dutch Book argument that works\nwith a more liberal conception of betting dispositions than mentioned\nabove (Smith 1961; Walley 1991: ch. 2 and 3). See\n supplement A\n for some non-technical details. Bayesians actually disagree over\nwhether coherence allows credences to be unsharp. For this debate, see\nthe survey by Mahtani (2019) and the entry on\n imprecise probabilities.\n\n\n",
