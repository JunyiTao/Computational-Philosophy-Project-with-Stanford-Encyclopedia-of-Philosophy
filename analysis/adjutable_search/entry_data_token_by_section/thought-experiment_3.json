    "main_text": "Current Views on Thought Experiments\n4. Current Views on Thought Experiments\n\nAt this point it is important to recall the key epistemological\nchallenge described in the introduction: how can we learn about the\nreal world through merely thinking about imagined scenarios? This\nchallenge sits at the center of the discussion about thought\nexperiments even though we must note that not all of the work\ndiscussed below focuses on it directly. Still, this section describes\nsix views that can be seen as responding in some way to this\nchallenge: The Skeptical Objection, The Intuition-Based Account, The\nArgument View, Conceptual Constructivism, Experimentalism, and The\nMental-Model Account.\n",
