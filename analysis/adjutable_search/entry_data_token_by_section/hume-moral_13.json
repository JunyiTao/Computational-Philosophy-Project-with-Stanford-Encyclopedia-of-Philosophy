    "main_text": "The Natural Virtues\n13. The Natural Virtues\n\n\nIn the Treatise Hume\u2019s principle interest in the natural\nvirtues lies in explaining the causes that make us approve them. The\nmechanism of sympathy ultimately accounts for this approval and the\ncorresponding disapproval of the natural vices. Sympathy also explains\nour approval of the artificial virtues; the difference is that we\napprove of those as a result of sympathy with the cumulative effects\nproduced by the general practice of the artificial virtues on the\nwhole of society (individual acts of justice not always producing\npleasure for anyone); whereas we approve each individual exercise of\nsuch natural virtues as gratitude and friendship because we sympathize\nwith those who are affected by each such action when we consider it\nfrom the common point of view. As we saw, he argues that the traits of\nwhich we approve fall into four groups: traits immediately agreeable\nto their possessor or to others, and traits advantageous to their\npossessor or to others. In these four groups of approved traits, our\napproval arises as the result of sympathy bringing into our minds the\npleasure that the trait produces for its possessor or for others (with\none minor exception). This is especially clear with such\nself-regarding virtues as prudence and industry, which we approve even\nwhen they occur in individuals who provide no benefit to us observers;\nthis can only be explained by our sympathy with the benefits that\nprudence and industry bring to their possessors.\n\n\nAccording to Hume, different levels and manifestations of the passions\nof pride and humility make for virtue or for vice. An obvious and\n\u201cover-weaning conceit\u201d is disapproved by any observer (is\na vice) (T 3.3.2.1); while a well-founded but concealed self-esteem is\napproved (is a virtue). Hume explains these opposite reactions to such\nclosely related character traits by means of the interplay of the\nobserver\u2019s sympathy with a distinct psychological mechanism he calls\ncomparison. The mechanism of comparison juxtaposes a\nsympathetically-communicated sentiment with the observer\u2019s own\ninherent feeling, causing the observer to feel a sentiment opposite to\nthe one she observes in another (pleasure if the other is suffering,\npain if the other is pleased) when the sympathetically-communicated\nsentiment is not too strong. A person who displays excessive pride\nirritates others because, while others come to feel this person\u2019s\npleasant sentiment of pride (to some degree) via sympathy, they also\nfeel a greater uneasiness as a result of comparing that great pride\n(in whose objects they do not believe) with their own lesser pride in\nthemselves; this is why conceit is a vice. Self-esteem founded on an\naccurate assessment of one\u2019s strengths and politely concealed from\nothers, though, is both agreeable and advantageous to its possessor\nwithout being distressing to others, and so is generally\napproved. (Thus the professed preference of Christians for humility\nover self-esteem does not accord with the judgments of most\nobservers.) Although excessive pride is a natural vice and self-esteem\na natural virtue, human beings in society create\nthe artificial virtue of good breeding (adherence to customs\nof slightly exaggerated mutual deference in accordance with social\nrank) to enable us each to conceal our own pride easily so that it\ndoes not shock the pride of others.\n\n\nCourage and military heroism are also forms of pride. Though the\nstudent of history can see that military ambition has mostly been\ndisadvantageous to human society, when we contemplate the\n\u201cdazling\u201d character of the hero, immediate sympathy\nirresistibly leads us to approve it (T 3.3.2.15).\n\n\nOur approval of those traits that may be grouped together under the\nheading of goodness and benevolence, such as generosity, humanity,\ncompassion, and gratitude, arises from sympathy with people in the\nindividual\u2019s \u201cnarrow circle\u201d of friends and associates,\nsince, given natural human selfishness, we cannot expect people\u2019s\nconcerns to extend farther (T 3.3.3.2). By adopting the common point of\nview we correct for the distortions of sympathy by entering into the\nfeelings of those close to the person being evaluated even if they are\nremote from us. The vice of cruelty is most loathed because the\nsuffering of the person\u2019s victims that reaches us via sympathy readily\nbecomes hatred of the perpetrator.\n\n\nAlthough natural abilities of the mind are not traditionally\nclassified as moral virtues and vices, the difference between these\ntypes of traits is unimportant, Hume argues. Intelligence, good\njudgment, application, eloquence, and wit are also mental qualities\nthat bring individuals the approbation of others, and their absence is\ndisapproved. As is the case with many of the traditionally-recognized\nvirtues, the various natural abilities are approved either because they\nare useful to their possessor or because they are immediately agreeable\nto others. It is sometimes argued that moral virtues are unlike natural\nabilities in that the latter are involuntary, but Hume argues that many\ntraditional moral virtues are involuntary as well. The sole difference\nis that the prospect of reward or punishment can induce people to act\nas the morally virtuous would (as justice requires, for example), but\ncannot induce them to act as if they had the natural abilities.\n",
