Environmental Aesthetics beyond Natural Environments\n\nSince they first took form in the late twentieth century, the initial\npositions in environmental aesthetics expanded from their original\nfocus on natural environments to consider human and human-influenced\nenvironments. At the same time, the discipline has also come to\ninclude the examination of that which falls within such environments,\ngiving rise to what is called the aesthetics of everyday life. This\narea involves the aesthetics of not only more common objects and\nenvironments, but also a range of everyday activities. Concerning both\nthe aesthetics of human environments and the aesthetics of everyday\nlife, approaches that combine the resources of both cognitive and\nnon-cognitive points of views have become more common and seem\nespecially fruitful.\n",
