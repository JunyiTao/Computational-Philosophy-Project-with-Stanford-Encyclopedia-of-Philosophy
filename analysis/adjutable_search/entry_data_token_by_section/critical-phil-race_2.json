    "main_text": "Introduction || Critical Race Theory\n1.2 Critical Race Theory\n\nCPR also draws from Critical Race Theory, or CRT. Like CLS, CRT\nscholars have been concerned to critique liberalism as the hegemonic\nideology of the West, but they pursue a more interdisciplinary\napproach. CRT scholars argued that solutions that stay within the\nbounds of liberalism are insufficient because \u201cracialized\npower\u201d is embedded \u201cin practices and values which have been\nshorn of any explicit, formal manifestations of racism\u201d (Delgado\n1995, xxix). Moreover, liberals often argue that any form of \u201crace\nconsciousness\u201d is racist, with the result that anti-racist\nreforms, such as affirmative action or housing subsidies, must prove\nallegiance to the doctrines of abstract individualism and present\nrace-conscious reforms as temporary deviations from the normative\nideals of neutrality. Liberal ideals that imagine individuals\nabstractly outside of their historical and social context thwart\nefforts to address the effects of historical legacies on current social\nrelations, property distributions, group welfare and security, and the\ndetermination of merit.\n\nIn an influential article, CRT scholar Richard Delgado shows that\nthe academic scholarship that pursues anti-racist ends is hobbled by an\nincapacity in effective self-reflection. In 1984 Delgado set out to\nfind the top twenty law review articles on civil rights\u2014those\nmost often cited, those published in the most well-established\njournals\u2014and found that all were written by white men. There was an\n\u201celaborate minuet\u201d of exclusively internal engagement\nwithin this grouping over the best means to move forward on racial\njustice (1995, 47). Their arguments were strong, but how could it be,\nDelgado wondered, that even an idea such as having a \u201cwithered\nself-concept\u201d would be best represented in the work of white\nauthors citing other white authors rather than the important work by\npeople of color on the phenomenal effect of racist societies? When he\nasked the author of one article on this topic why theorists such as W.\nE. B. Du Bois, Kenneth Clark, Frantz Fanon or others were not cited,\nthe author explained that he preferred the source he cited because it\nwas \u201cso elegant.\u201d Criticism directed at the origin of\nintellectual work continues to be considered a suspect species of ad\nhominem argument, making concerns about the politics of citation appear\nillegitimate. Yet can white writing achieve sufficiency in a matter\nsuch as self-esteem that involves first person experience? The problem\nhere, from Delgado\u2019s perspective, was that ruling out\nconsiderations of social identity in the development of intellectual\nwork diminished the quality of that intellectual work, but in a way\nthat liberal premises could never reveal.\n\nConnected to this has been the ongoing problem of the\nconceptualization of \u201cmerit.\u201d If normal hiring or\npublications decisions are viewed as generic, without considerations of\nthe social identity of the candidate, then preferential hiring is a\ndeviation from the norm and must meet a high bar to establish even\ntemporary legitimacy. But both CLS and CRT have endeavored to show that\nmerit-based decisions often promulgate implicit racism. Judging which\nare the top articles by the number of their citations may look to be a\nneutral standard, but it in fact perpetuates injustice while concealing\nthat injustice.\n",
