What is traditionally required from such a justification\nis an argument that establishes that using inductive inferences does\nnot lead us astray. Although it seems to be a meaningful question\nwhether there is such a justification for our inductive practices,\nDavid Hume argues that there can be no such justification (Hume\n[1739\u201340] 2000; see the discussion of Hume in the entry on\n the problem of induction).\nIt is important to understand that Hume\u2019s argument is\ngeneral. It is not just an argument against a particular\nattempt to justify induction in the sense above, but a general argument\nthat there can be no such justification at all.\nIn order to see the generality of this argument, we have to note\nthat the same problem also arises for deduction (FFF,\n\u00a7III.2). That deduction is in the same predicament is observed by\nGoodman and exploited for his solution of Hume\u2019s problem of induction.\nThus the upshot of Goodman\u2019s understanding of Hume\u2019s argument is that\nthere can be no justification of our inferential practices, if such a\njustification requires a reason for their justifiedness. Accordingly,\nthe old problem of induction, which requires such a justification of\ninduction, is a pseudo-problem.\n",
