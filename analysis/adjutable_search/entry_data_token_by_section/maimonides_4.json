    "main_text": "Creation\n5. Creation\n\n\nThroughout the Guide, Maimonides considers four accounts of\ncreation: that of the kalam, Moses, Plato, and Aristotle. He rejects\nthe kalam account (GP 1.71\u201373) according which one\ndemonstrates that the universe must have been created and then reasons\nthat if it was created, it must have a creator. Like Thomas Aquinas,\nMaimonides believes it is impossible to show by logical considerations\nalone either that the universe was created or that it is eternal.\nThough Maimonides says he believes in creation, he admits one can do no\nmore than tip the scales in this direction. As of Guide 2.13,\nhe limits his discussion to the theories of Moses, Plato, and\nAristotle.\n\n\nUnfortunately Maimonides\u2019 characterizations of these alternatives\nare neither precise nor historically accurate (Seeskin 2005). Suffice\nit to say that his treatment of them is mainly thematic. Briefly\nstated, they are:\n\n\nMoses:\nthe world was created de novo and entirely ex\nnihilo.\n\n\nPlato:\nthe world was created de novo from a preexisting material\nsubstrate.\n\n\nAristotle:\nthe world is eternal and its existence is best understood as eternal\ninformation of matter.\n\n\n\n\nBased on his explicit remarks, Maimonides prefers the theory of\nMoses but allows one to hold that of Plato as a reasonable alternative.\nBut there has always been a school of thought that maintains that he is\nsecretly committed to the view of Aristotle (Harvey 1981). My own\nposition is with those who argue that Maimonides\u2019 explicit remarks are\nan accurate account of his view and that all the arguments he offers\npoint in that direction (Davidson 1979, Feldman 1990, Hyman 1988,\nWolfson 1973).\n\n\nThe historical Aristotle did argue that the world is eternal and\nthat whatever is eternal is necessary [On Generation and\nCorruption 338a1\u20134, Physics 203b 29, Metaphysics\n1050b8\u201315]. His medieval followers took this to mean that while the\nworld is ontologically dependent on God, there is no moment when it\nfirst comes to be and therefore does not owe its existence to a\ndecision to create. As we might say, it exists not because of anything\nGod does but simply because of what God is. Because God\u2019s nature does\nnot change, according to this position, neither does the existence or\nfundamental structure of the world. The most important consequence of\nthis view is that God does not exercise free choice, which is to say\nthat according to the Aristotelian alternative, the world is governed\nby necessity.\n\n\nThe standard arguments in favor of this position take one of two\napproaches: either they show that there is something inherent in the\nnature of the world that makes creation impossible or that there is\nsomething inherent in the nature of God that does. An example of the\nformer is that change always proceeds from something to something else,\nas when a chicken springs from an egg or an acorn develops into a full\ngrown oak tree. If this is true, it is impossible for something to come\nto be from nothing (ex nihilo). An example of the latter is\nthat if God is perfect, it makes no sense to suppose that God could\never do anything new such as bring the world into being.\n\n\nMaimonides\u2019 answer to the first argument (GP 2.17) is that\ngiven the world as we know it, change does proceed from one thing to\nsomething else. But why should we assume the creation of the world has\nto follow the same pattern? An account of creation is a theory of\norigin, how a thing comes to be initially. By contrast, an account of\nchange is a theory of development or alteration, how one existing thing\nemerges into another. For all we know, the origin of a thing may be\ncompletely different from its development later on. Thus it is\npresumptuous to suppose that we can extrapolate from our experience of\nthe world as it is at present to the moment of its creation. It follows\nthat the first argument against creation is not decisive, which means\nthat creation remains a possibility.\n\n\nMaimonides\u2019 answer to the second argument (GP 2.18) is that\nin a perfect being, willing something new need not imply change. If I\nwill today to take a trip tomorrow and events intercede to spoil my\nplans, I may have to change my mind, but to suppose that something\nanalogous happens to God is absurd. Assume I will today to do something\ntomorrow independent of external circumstances \u2014 to think about the\nnumerical characteristics of pi. And assume that when tomorrow comes, I\ndo exactly as planned. While I would be undertaking something new, to\nthe degree that I had intended to do it all along, it would be\nmisleading to say that I underwent a change. Certainly I did not\nundergo a change of mind.\n\n\nMaimonides takes this to mean that it is possible for a being not\naffected by external circumstances to will something new as long as it\nis part of his original intention. This is sometimes expressed by\nsaying that changing one\u2019s will is not the same as willing change. So\nonce again, the argument against creation is not decisive.\n\n\nMaimonides is aware that all his arguments establish is the\npossibility of creation, not its actuality. To go further, and argue\nfor the actuality of creation, he returns to the claim that everything\nthat is eternal is necessary. If it could be shown that there are\nfeatures of the world that are not necessary, it would follow that the\nworld must have been created. Here Maimonides challenges Aristotle and\nhis followers on the issue of astronomy.\n\n\nMedieval Aristotelians believed as follows. God thinks and manifests\nself-awareness. Because God is one and simple, what emerges from God\nmust be one and simple as well. In this way, God generates the first\nheavenly intelligence. According to Alfarabi, because the first\nintelligence is aware of two things \u2014 itself and God \u2014 it\nis capable of generating two things: the second heavenly intelligence\nand the outermost sphere of the universe. By contrast, Avicenna held\nthat because the first intelligence is aware of God and duality in\nitself, it generates three things. The difference need not concern us\nhere. The important point is that God\u2019s production of the outermost\nsphere is indirect; the immediate cause is the activity of the first\nintelligence. The process continues until we get the ten intelligences\nand nine primary spheres that make up the standard picture of medieval\ncosmology.\n\n\nMaimonides criticizes this account in two ways. First if the\noriginator of a causal sequence is one and simple, there is no way for\ncomplexity to arise, and everything else in the sequence should be one\nand simple as well (GP 2.22). Even if the sequence contains\nthousands of members, there is no way to account for the complexity of\na celestial sphere, which is a composite of matter and form. When we\nget to the inner spheres, we have to account for even more because not\nonly is there the sphere itself but the stars or planets attached to\nit. They too are composites of matter and form. How can we have such\ncomplexity if we start with something that is radically one?\n\n\nSecond, there are features of the heavenly bodies that defy\nscientific explanation and thus appear to be contingent in the sense\nthat they were chosen rather than necessitated (GP 2.19\u201324).\nIf the outer spheres impart motion to the inner ones, we would expect\nspherical motion to slow as we move closer to the earth. But this is\nhardly the case. As Maimonides points out (GP 2.19):\n\n\nWe see that in case of some spheres, the swifter of motion is above\nthe slower; that in the case of others, the slower of motion is above\nthe swifter; and that, again in another case, the motions of the\nspheres are of equal velocity though one be above the other. There are\nalso other very grave matters if regarded from the point of view these\nthings are as they are in virtue of necessity.\n\n\nIf there is no explanation for why the spheres behave in this\nfashion, or why some stars and planets emit more light than others, or\nwhy some regions of the heavens are relatively crowded while others are\nempty, there is no reason to think the phenomena in question are what\nthey are by virtue of necessity. If there is no necessity, there are no\ngrounds for eternity. The alternative is to say that God created the\nworld as a result of a free choice and fashioned it in a particular\nway.\n\n\nMaimonides recognizes (GP 2.24) that his argument does not\nconstitute a demonstration. Just because science cannot explain\nsomething now, it does not follow that it will never be able to explain\nit. As he himself admits, science can and does make progress. But in\nthe case of the heavenly bodies, he thought progress very unlikely.\nBecause they too far away to make close observations, and too high in\nrank, we can only rely on inferences based on accidental qualities\nsize, speed, and direction. As long as this is true, we will never know\ntheir essential natures and will never be able to support claims of\nnecessity. As long as this is true, creation, though not demonstrated,\nwill always be preferable to eternity.\n\n\nMaimonides (GP 2.25) also offers a practical reason for\nbelieving in creation: How can a God without free will issue\ncommandments? Beyond this there is a textual reason: belief in creation\ndoes less violence to scripture than belief in eternity. He concludes\nthat the theory of Moses offers the best alternative, while that of\nPlato, which retains the idea of creation de novo, is\nacceptable. Though some people fault Maimonides for not coming up with\na stronger argument on behalf of Moses, he would reply by saying that\ngiven the limits of our knowledge, this is the strongest argument we\ncan expect. Although Maimonides is often seen as part of the\nAristotelian tradition, and often expresses praise for Aristotle, his\naccount of creation indicate that he is willing to depart from\nAristotle when he thinks the arguments lead in that direction.\n",
