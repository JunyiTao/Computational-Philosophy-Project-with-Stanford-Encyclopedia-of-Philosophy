    "main_text": "Key Terms and Distinctions || Canonical Western Philosophy\n1.2 Canonical Western Philosophy\n\nAs used throughout the essay, \u201ccanonical Western\nphilosophy\u201d refers to the Western philosophical tradition\ntraceable to Ancient Greece. It includes the works by the philosophers\nwho are most commonly taught at the majority of colleges and\nuniversities throughout the English speaking Western world. In this\ntradition, there is a striking degree of agreement about the\n\u201cconceptual framework\u201d\u2014the basic beliefs, values,\nattitudes, assumptions, and concepts\u2014that define \u201cthe\ncanon\u201d. These include the following: (a) a commitment\nto rationalism, the view that reason (or rationality) is not\nonly the hallmark of being human; it is what makes humans superior to\nnonhuman animals and nature; (b) a conception of humans as\nrational beings who are capable of abstract reasoning, entertaining\nobjective principles, and understanding or calculating the\nconsequences of actions; (c) conceptions of both the ideal moral agent\nand the knower as impartial, detached\nand disinterested; (d) a belief in\nfundamental dualisms, such as reason versus emotion, mind\nversus body, culture versus nature, absolutism versus relativism, and\nobjectivity versus subjectivity; (e) an assumption that there is\nan ontological divide between humans and nonhuman animals and\nnature; and (f) universalizability as a criterion for\nassessing the truth of ethical and epistemological principles (see\nWarren 2009).\nMany of these key features of canonical Western philosophy are\nchallenged by positions in feminist environmental philosophy. When,\nwhere and how this occurs is addressed throughout the essay.\n",
