Other Directions: Legality, a \u201cModal Kind\u201d and Coercion\n\nIn the Introduction a distinction was drawn between conceptual and\nevaluative questions about the relationship between law and morality;\nand it was said that the limits of law is generally taken to be a\nstrictly evaluative question. The term \u201claw\u201d is generally\nleft largely unanalysed, with the emphasis on the law\u2019s coercive\nmeans and the extent to which it may legitimately be deployed in the\npursuit of moral ends. But will be seen, there are some approaches\nsceptical of the distinction\u2019s importance to our understanding\nof the limits of law.\n\nIt is uncontroversial to say that a (further) kind of limit of law is\nthat contained in the idea of legality. Lon Fuller famously identified\neight \u201cdesiderata\u201d for laws. Laws should be general; they\nshould be promulgated to their norm-subjects; and they should be\nprospective. They should be understandable (perhaps with professional\nhelp); the obligations they impose should be susceptible to being\njointly fulfilled; and they should not require anything beyond the\ncapacities of their norm-subjects. Laws should be tolerably stable\nand, finally, they should actually be upheld by the relevant legal\nofficials, rather than ignored, bypassed or replaced by what the\nofficials applying them consider more congenial standards (Fuller\n1964; Rundle 2012: Ch. 4; Waldron 2016 [2020]; Sunstein & Vermeule\n2020). Kristen Rundle and Jeremy Waldron both argue that the legal\npositivism of Hart and Raz, as well as a broader instrumentalism that\nwould take in\n Devlin,[13]\n is too casual and accommodating in allowing the designation\n\u201clegal system\u201d and \u201claw\u201d to systems and norms\nthat fall short on the criteria of legality (Waldron 2008: 14; Rundle\n2012: 202). This implies that one cannot simply take the question of\nthe limits of law to be an evaluative question. This would\nunderestimate the extent to which supposedly conceptual questions\nabout the existence of legal systems and laws are themselves\nevaluative questions. Hence the limits of the law should be seen\nsquarely as both an evaluative and a conceptual question. Against\nthis, while granting that conceptual questions matter and are\nthemselves a large focus in the philosophy of law, one might wonder\nhow far they matter to the specific issue of the limits of the law. If\nit is accepted for example that Fuller\u2019s desiderata for legality\nor something close to them are indeed desiderata as well as to some\nextent conceptual features of the law (as does Raz 1977), does it\ngreatly matter that one might conceive of such features as conceptual\nto a still greater extent?\n\nIt is widely said by those sympathetic to the instrumentalist\nunderstanding of law that law is a \u201cmodal kind\u201d rather\nthan a \u201cfunctional kind\u201d, distinguished by its means (or\ntechniques) rather than its ends; the moral legitimacy of such ends\nbeing contingent (Green 1996: 1711). In the words of John Gardner:\n\n\n[T]o say that law is a modal as opposed to a functional kind is merely\nto say that law is not distinguished by its functions\u2014by the\npurposes it is capable of serving. It is distinguished rather by the\ndistinctive means that it provides for serving whatever ends it\nserves. Law is what Kelsen memorably called a \u201cspecific social\ntechnique\u201d (Gardner 2012: 195\u2013220, 207; cf. Kelsen 1941;\nSummers 1971).\n\n\nThe idea of the legal techniques, developed by Robert\nSummers, from both the positivism of Hans Kelsen and the\nanti-positivism of Fuller, points however to a line of thought about\nthe limits of the law that is surely due a revival. The debate as it\nis mostly prosecuted is too dominated by the one\n\u201ctechnique\u201d of coercion. While giving coercion its due\nSummers also emphasized\n\n\neducational effort, rewards and other incentives, symbolic deployment\nof legal forms, publicity (favourable or adverse), continuous\nsupervision, public signs and signals, recognized statuses and\nentities\n\n\nand\n\n\ngrants with strings attached. (Summers 1977: 126)\n\n\nThere is also growing awareness at a theoretical level of the\nimportance of expressive values in the law (McAdams 2015). It is\nsomething of a loss that the schema developed by Summers and his\ncollaborators, dividing legal techniques into\n\u201cgrievance-remedial\u201d, \u201cpenal-corrective\u201d,\n\u201cadministrative-regulatory\u201d, \u201cpublic-benefit\nconferral\u201d, \u201cfacilitator of private arrangements\u201d,\nappears to have fallen largely into disuse (Summers et al. 1986). For\nit allowed various areas of potential legal concern to be examined\nagainst a background of various legal techniques, coercive and beyond.\nRawls\u2019 question of how far such techniques should be subject to\npublic reason is a further issue that might helpfully be pressed.\n",
