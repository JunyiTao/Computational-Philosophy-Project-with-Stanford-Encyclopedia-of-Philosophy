    "main_text": "Theology || Miracles\n3.3 Miracles\n\nPrice\u2019s illuminating discussion of Hume\u2019s notorious attack\non the credibility of miracles is informed both by his interest in\nprobability theory, and by his good sense. Hume\u2019s argument, in a\nnutshell, is that there can never be sufficient reason to believe in a\nviolation of a law of nature because we know, a priori, that\nany evidence from testimony for the occurrence of a miracle will be\noutweighed by our evidence from long experience that such things do\nnot happen. Our confidence in the reliability of testimony and our\nconfidence in some generalization being a law of nature have the same\nsource: experience. But whereas we have often found testimony to be\nfalse, the experiences on which our belief in a law of nature is\nfounded are exceptionless. If there were exceptions, we would conclude\nthat we were not dealing with a law of nature. So we always have more\nevidence that a miracle did not occur than that it did. Hume presents\nus with a characteristic fork. If what is reported would violate a law\nof nature, then we should not give credence to the report. If what is\nreported is merely uncommon, then we might have sufficient evidence to\nbelieve it, but the event would not be miraculous.\n\nPrice disputes four claims, on which he thinks Hume\u2019s argument\nrests.\nThe most important are the first three.\n\n \u201cThat the credit we give to testimony, is derived\nsolely from experience\u201d\n \u201cThat a miracle is a fact contrary to\nexperience\u201d\n \u201cThat the previous improbability of a fact is a proof\nagainst it, diminishing, in proportion to the degree of it, the proof\nfrom testimony for it\u201d (D 389).\n\n\nPrice\u2019s rebuttals are as follows.\n\nOur confidence in the reliability of testimony rests, and should\nrest, not only on the frequency with which testimony has been\nconfirmed balanced against the frequency with which it has been\ndisconfirmed, but also on our knowledge of the character(s) of those\nbearing witness, and of people in general.\n\n\nOne action, or one conversation with a man, may convince us of his\nintegrity and induce us to believe his testimony, though we have\nnever, in a single instance, experienced his veracity. (D 399)\n\n\u201cA miracle is more properly an event different from\nexperience than contrary to it\u201d (D 402). Testimony to\nan unusual event, while it provides evidence for the occurrence of\nthat event, does not contradict our experience of what\nhappened before, or even conflict with it. We would continue to be as\njustified as we were previously in believing that this kind of event\nhad not happened before. Prior uniform observation is not\nexperiential evidence against the occurrence of the unusual.\n\u201c[I]t can be no part of any one\u2019s experience, that the\ncourse of nature will continue always the same\u201d (D 402). Were\nthis not so, we could never have reason to believe that something we\npreviously took to be a law of nature was not in fact one.\n Price argues that it is very common for \u201cthe slightest\ntestimony to overcome an almost infinite improbability\u201d (D 406).\nThe prior probability of many common facts is extremely low, yet the\nevidence of testimony is sufficient to confirm them. Take an example\nwhere the prior probability can be calculated: the odds against any\nparticular distribution of cards in a game of Bridge are enormous. Yet\nthe testimony of the players as to what was in each hand is quite\nsufficient to establish that as a fact. What is more, Price argues,\nvariations in the prior improbability of the event are irrelevant when\nit comes to the weight of testimony. \u201cThe only causes of\nfalsehood in testimony are the intention to deceive, and the danger of\nbeing deceived\u201d (D 415). But the degree of prior improbability\ndoes not increase or diminish either of these.\n\n\nImprobabilities \u2026 as such, do not affect the\ncapacity of testimony to report truth. They \u2026 should\nnot be considered as a counter-evidence invalidating, in\nproportion to their degree, its reports.\u2014But tho\u2019 this is\ntrue, it by no means follows, that they may not in many circumstances\naffect the credit of testimony, or cause us to question its\nveracity. (D 417)\n \n\n\nAs Hume pointed out, mankind are lovers of the marvelous, and\nraconteurs delight in feeding that credulity. If someone reports a\ntruly astonishing event, especially if it redounds to the\nnarrator\u2019s credit, or supports some ideology she is keen to\npromote, that may lead us \u201cto question the faithfulness of a\nreport, and give just ground to suspect a design to misrepresent or\nexaggerate\u201d (D 420). Price points out, however, that this only\napplies when the reporter is aware of the marvelous nature of their\ntale. Mere coincidence does not diminish the evidential\nweight of testimony.\n\n\n[W]ere a person to tell us that \u2026 at the time of drawing a\nlottery, he happened to hear his age, the day of the month, and the\ndate of the year drawn together, we should scarcely believe him,\ntho\u2019 we know that he was not more unlikely to hear these numbers\ndrawn, than any other particular numbers. But if the same person was\nonly to tell us the numbers themselves, and the coincidence which\nstrikes us was entirely our own discovery, we should have just the\nsame reason for believing his account, as if there had been no such\ncoincidence. (D 422\u20133)\n\n\nThe upshot is that, in Price\u2019s view, the debate should neither\nfocus on the abstract possibility of evidence for miracles, nor on\ntheir prior improbability, but, rather, on the particular question of\nwhether the Apostles were either deceived or were themselves\ndeceivers. Price, needless to say, is confident of victory on this\nground, though others may demur.\n",
