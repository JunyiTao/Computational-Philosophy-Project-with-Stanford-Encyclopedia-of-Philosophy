Hutcheson\u2019s Normative Ethics\n\nMost of the scholarly attention paid to Hutcheson concerns his\nmetaethics\u2014the nature of his moral psychology, his understanding\nof the ontological status of moral facts, his critique of rationalism,\nand so forth. But equally interesting is his\nnormative ethics, which features a striking critique of\n\u201cself-interest\u201d theories, a unification of virtue and\nhappiness, and a view that clearly anticipates later British\nutilitarianism.\n",
