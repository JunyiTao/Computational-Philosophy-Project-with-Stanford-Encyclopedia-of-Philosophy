Philosophy, Encyclopedia, and the Turn to Empirical Science\n\nDas Allgemeine Brouillon brings to light the close connection\nin Novalis\u2019s work between philosophy and empirical science. Yet\nthe Brouillon is not meant to give a final account of\nphilosophical knowledge, but aspires to recapitulate the state of\nknowledge as it currently is, hence providing an impetus to revision\nand improvement. In order to enhance its stakes and procedures,\nhowever, reason needs a point of orientation, an idea of what\nuniversal knowledge would amount to, even though such knowledge by\ndefinition is out of reach. In Novalis\u2019s work, the very idea of\na philosophical encyclopedia provides such a point of orientation.\n\nThe affiliation with empirical science is another point at which\nNovalis\u2019s understanding of the fragment differs from that of\nFriedrich Schlegel. Whereas Schlegel establishes a close link between\nphilosophy and poetry\u2014at times he even dismantles the\ndistinction between them\u2014Novalis is convinced that if human\nreason seeks everywhere for the unconditioned (das\nUnbedingte) but finds nothing but things (Dinge) (MO\n#1), then we better study these things closely and try to make sense\nof them. That is, in his view, reason is inevitably driven towards the\nidea of an infinite, pre-reflexive, and pre-subjective ground or first\nprinciple, an unconditioned, which it itself can never grasp; what it\ncan grasp, though, are the manifestations of such a ground in the\nworld to which it has access through experience and science. Thus\nNovalis claims that \u201cIdealism is nothing but genuine\nempiricism\u201d (AB #402). Novalis also defines philosophy\nas a science of science (AB #886); it explores the conditions for the\nstudy of nature, human nature included.\n\nSo conceived, philosophy is not cut off from practical purposes. Under\nthe heading \u201cEncyclopedistics,\u201d Novalis explains that\n\u201cHalf theories lead away from\npraxis\u2014whole theories lead back to it\u201d\n(AB #537). Or, as he, in the spirit of Kant\u2019s teleology of\nnature, stages his metaphysical program: \u201cPhilosophy cannot bake\nbread\u2014however, it can provide us with God, freedom and\nimmortality\u2014now which is more practical\u2014philosophy or\neconomics?\u201d (AB #401). And in a slightly earlier work, Novalis,\nreferring to the Kantian definition of metaphysics, claims that\n\u201cWe only know it, insofar we realize\nit\u201d (KS, 331, cf. also HKA 2, 378).\n\nIn Novalis\u2019s view, true philosophical insight, addressing issues\nof legitimacy as well as the question of meaning (or, in Kantian\nlanguage, the regulative ideas of reason), provides a deepened\nself-understanding that guides our practice and orientation in the\nworld. The fragment strengthens this dimension of philosophy in that\nit fosters critical distance and independent thinking. Such an\nintellectual stance, in turn, is a condition of possibility for\ngenuine intersubjectivity, ultimately also for the republican ideals\nthat Novalis is promoting. Before we get that far, however, we need to\nlook, in more detail, at Novalis\u2019s engagement with the ideals of\nthe Enlightenment and the philosophy of German Idealism.\n",
