    "main_text": "Life and Work\n1. Life and Work\n\nJohn Anderson was born in 1893 in the weaving and coal-mining village\nof Stonehouse, Lanarkshire (about 20km from Glasgow). His father was\nschoolmaster in the village and politically active in the Independent\nLabour Party. In 1911 Anderson began his university studies at the\nUniversity of Glasgow, enrolling in two successive honours degrees:\nmathematics/natural philosophy (including laboratory training) and\nlogic/moral philosophy (including political economy). His\nundergraduate studies extended throughout the years of the World War,\nculminating in 1917 with his Masters thesis on the philosophy of\nWilliam James. Declared medically unfit for service, his experience of\nthe war was dominated by the Red Clydeside industrial and rental\ndisputes, characterised by workers\u2019 resistance to state and\nindustry attempts to re-organise work practices and personnel in the\ninterests of a supposed common national interest. The disputes\nultimately led to state suppression at the conclusion of the war when\nBritish troops and artillery were deployed to Glasgow.\n\nAnderson\u2019s philosophical direction was powerfully influenced by\nthe Australian-born philosopher, Samuel Alexander, who delivered the\nGifford Lectures at Glasgow in 1918. In the previous year Anderson had\nbeen awarded for an essay supporting Henry Jones\u2019 practical\nidealist view of the state as a moral agent. Following\nAlexander\u2019s lectures (later published as Space, Time and\nDeity) Anderson accepted the case for the complete rejection of\nthis form of idealism in favour of a new and systematic realist\nprogramme.\n\nIn 1919 Anderson married fellow philosophy student Jenny Baillie, was\nappointed assistant lecturer at University College of South Wales\n(where he also provided Workers\u2019 Education Classes) and was\nsubsequently appointed assistant lecturer in logic at the University\nof Glasgow. In 1920 he was appointed lecturer at the University of\nEdinburgh and so became the main exponent of realism in Norman Kemp\nSmith\u2019s Department of Logic and Metaphysics. In the same year,\nhis brother William accepted the Chair of Mental and Moral Philosophy\nat Auckland University College, New Zealand.\n\nBy 1926 Anderson had become dispirited by the rejection for\npublication of a textbook on logic that he had been working on since\n1922. He had also become politically isolated in the department\nbecause of his support for the General Strike in Britain. Such factors\nmay have moved him to accept the Challis Chair of Philosophy at the\nUniversity of Sydney, although as with his brother, the movement of\nScottish philosophers to Commonwealth universities was not unusual. In\n1927 he moved with Jennie and their young son Alexander\n(\u201cSandy\u201d) to Sydney.\n\nAnderson\u2019s first serious professional engagement was in a\ncritical discussion of F. C. S. Schiller\u2019s logic,\n\u201cPropositions and Judgments\u201d and \u201cThe Truth of\nPropositions\u201d (1926). The first outlines of a distinctive\nrealist position were made in \u201cEmpiricism\u201d and \u201cThe\nKnower and the Known\u201d (1927). After his arrival at Sydney,\nAnderson was intent upon developing this position and was dismissive\nof the fragmentary nature of most international philosophy in the wake\nof the \u201clinguistic turn\u201d. The important philosophical work\nin Anderson\u2019s view was to establish and preserve a school of\nrealist philosophy as the repository of a tradition of critical\ninquiry that would remain alert to the dangers of corrupting external\nforces and expectations. \n\nShortly after his arrival at Sydney, Anderson became a\n\u201ctheoretical advisor\u201d to the Australian Communist Party\nand so began a long history of antagonising conservative political and\ncultural representatives in the city. He was repeatedly accused of\ndisloyalty and communist sympathies by returned servicemen\norganisations, the churches and the conservative political parties.\nThe University Senate ultimately debated censure although a motion to\ndeclare him unfit to occupy the Chair of Philosophy was defeated. \n\nIn 1930 James Joyce\u2019s Ulysses was banned in Australia\nand the Freethought Society was formed with Anderson as President.\nAnderson\u2019s political influence at Sydney primarily took the form\nof a libertarian pluralism, particularly concerned with issues of\nstate and religious censorship and interference in education. By the\n1940s and 1950s his political position was strongly anti-communist.\nYet he remained unpopular with conservative politicians and clerics\nand was criticised for \u201ccorrupting the city\u2019s youth\u201d\nas late as 1961.\n\nIn 1935 Anderson became the editor of The Australasian Journal of\nPsychology and Philosophy. He had previously contributed\nsignificantly to the journal with his articles \u201cDeterminism and\nEthics\u201d (1928), \u201cThe Non-Existence of\nConsciousness\u201d, \u201c\u2018Universals\u2019 and\nOccurrences\u201d (1929), \u201cThe Place of Hegel in the History of\nPhilosophy\u201d, \u201cUtilitarianism\u201d (1932), \u201cRealism\nand Some of its Critics\u201d (1933), and \u201cMind as\nFeeling\u201d (1934). He retained editorial responsibility for the\njournal until 1947 when it passed to John Passmore with the new name\nThe Australasian Journal of Philosophy.\n\nIn 1958 Anderson retired and in 1962 died at his home in\nSydney\u2019s northern suburbs. The Challis Chair of Philosophy was\noccupied for the next 30 years by Anderson\u2019s students, J. L.\nMackie (1959\u20131963) and D. M. Armstrong (1964\u20131991). Both\nphilosophers were critical of Anderson\u2019s philosophy and were\nmore engaged with contemporary philosophical debates, but both also\nacknowledged Anderson\u2019s formative influence on their work.\n\nIn 1972 members of the Department of Philosophy at the University of\nSydney were caught in a bitter dispute concerning subject matter,\neducational practices and the nature of philosophical study itself,\nand by the start of 1974 the department had split into two separate\nunits. D. M. Armstrong led the minority Department of Traditional and\nModern Philosophy away from what he perceived to be the politically\nradical but philosophically barren Department of General Philosophy.\nPolitical disruptions throughout the academic world in the early 1970s\nwere not uncommon, but the particular intransigence and secessionist\ntendencies which characterised both sides of the conflict at Sydney\nmay well have been at least in part a legacy of Anderson\u2019s\nteaching and practice. The department eventually reunited some thirty\nyears later.\n",
