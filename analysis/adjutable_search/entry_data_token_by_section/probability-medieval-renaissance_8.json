    "main_text": "Scholastic Concepts of Probability || Proto-frequentist probability\n3.2 Proto-frequentist probability\n\nHacking (1975) famously claimed that frequentist conceptions of\nprobability largely arose as a side-product of the seventeenth century\nrevolution in probability. Historians of ideas quickly identified the\nweaknesses in Hacking\u2019s thesis (Brown 1987; Daston 1988; Garber\nand Zabell 1979). An understanding of probability as what happens most\nof the time or for the most part (h\u014ds epi to polu) can\nalready be found in Aristotle and the scholastics. The frequentist\nnotion of probability therefore seems to possess a long pre-modern\n history.[20]\n Unfortunately, things are far more complicated. Modern frequentism\narose as a complex of ideas in the nineteenth century, perhaps\nevolving only in the twentieth century into a full-fledged conception\nof probability (Gillies 2000, 88\u2013113). Hence, early modern uses\n(such as Jacob Bernoulli\u2019s) of the relative frequency of\noccurrences in a sequence of events are not yet frequentist in the\nmodern sense. Medieval (and ancient) uses of ut frequenter\nconsiderations differ, in turn, from early modern (proto-)frequentism\n(see Schuessler 2019, chap. 12). Having made this point, in what\nfollows, proto-frequentism will be used without the qualification\n\u201cmedieval\u201d.\n\nAs has been shown, medieval readers could have gleaned frequentist\nideas from Cicero even before the rise of Aristotelianism in the\ntwelfth and thirteenth centuries. Cicero stipulates that\nprobabilis can mean \u201cfor the most part\u201d, and\nmedieval authors who followed him therefore held a proto-frequentist\nconception of probability. Later on, such a conception was often\nderived from the works of Aristotle. Did this make any difference? Let\nus look at four examples:\n\nIt is sufficient that you obtain a probable certainty, which means\nthat in most cases (ut in pluribus) you are right and only in\na few cases (ut in paucioribus) are you wrong. (Thomas\nAquinas, Summa theologiae II-II, q. 70,\n 2)[21]\nIt is not probable that, among the vast number of the faithful,\nthere would not be many people who would readily supply the needs of\nthose whom they hold in reverence because of the perfection of their\nvirtue. (Thomas Aquinas, Summa contra gentiles, lib. 3, 135,\n19, 187)\nBut, from some pre-existing causes future effects do not follow\nnecessarily, but usually. For instance, in most cases (ut in\npluribus) a perfect human being results from the insemination of\na mother by a man\u2019s semen; sometimes, however, monsters are\ngenerated, because of some obstruction which overcomes the operation\nof the natural capacity. (Thomas Aquinas, Summa contra\ngentiles, lib. 3, 154, 11, 243)\nHence, in this proposal we have men and women, who at age 25 buy a\nlife-long annuity for a price which they recover within eight years\nand although they can die within these eight years it is more probable\nthat they live twice the time. In this way what happens more\nfrequently and is more probable is to the advantage of the buyer.\n(Alexander of Alessandria, Tractatus de usuris, c. 72, Y f.\n 146r)[22]\n\n\nPassage (i) should not be understood as granting probable certainty\n(certitudo probabilis) whenever a person is more often right\nthan wrong. The few exceptions mentioned ought to be really\nexceptional in order to allow for a probable certainty, which was\ndeemed sufficient for blameless moral action. Probable certainty was\nthus a threshold rather than a frequency concept.\n\nPassage (ii) refers to the high likelihood that at least some among a\nlarge number of people will possess a desired trait. This is a\nproto-statistical statement, but it does not show that probability\nmeans frequent occurrence. The claim that, among a large\nnumber of people, some will have a rare trait can easily be believed\n\u2013 depending on the trait in question \u2013 by a multitude or\nby \u201cthe wise\u201d. Consequently, ut in pluribus\nclaims might often have been indicators of endoxic probability rather\nthan expressions of an independent concept of probability.\n\nPassage (iii) postulates a natural regularity. Sexual conception\nusually results in \u201cperfect\u201d (as opposed to deformed or\n\u201cmonstrous\u201d) offspring. This ut in pluribus claim\nrefers to a majority of occurrences, but its background in\nAristotelian natural philosophy is significant. Scholars debate\nwhether Aristotle\u2019s understanding of \u201cfor the most\npart\u201d judgments is equivalent to a frequentist concept of\nprobability (Judson 1991; Kraut 2006; Winter 1997). Aristotelian\n\u201cfor the most part\u201d judgments imply much more in terms of\nlaw-like or natural connections than can be captured by mere reference\nto relative frequencies. It is therefore plausible to assume the same\nfor medieval Aristotelians, in particular for those who wrote about\nnatural processes.\n\nPassage (iv) is probably closest to implicit statistical reasoning and\nrefers, not by chance, to an economic context. The passage quoted\ndeals with fairness requirements between buyers and sellers of life\nannuities. A lump sum payment of a buyer and his or her (widows liked\nto buy annuities) uncertain stream of income require an equitable\nbalance. The uncertainty or risk in question pertains to the possible\ndeath of the owner of an annuity; and it is claimed that persons who\nare 25 years old will probably live more than eight further years. It\nmay be apt to speak in this case of a probability of more than 0.5 for\nfurther survival. Medieval considerations concerning insurance or\nannuities show that numerical probability was never too far away,\nwhich adds to our amazement that this step did not occur before the\nseventeenth century. Passage (iv), however, contains two\nprobability-related terms: the buyer is favored by what occurs more\noften (frequentius) and is more probable\n(probabilius). Kantola assumes that the words\nfrequentius and probabilius are synonymous here, as\nin several other cases in which they occur\n together.[23]\n Yet why would scholastic authors repeat two synonymous words if one\nwould do? The combined use of \u201cfrequent\u201d and\n\u201cprobable\u201d often occurs in matter of fact contexts (as in\nour example) which require no rhetorical flourishes. There is no\napparent need for emphasis through a repetition of synonyms. A\nplausible answer is that the two terms are not, in fact, synonymous\nand that frequency justifies an ascription of probability, although\nprobability means something else. It would make sense to\ncombine both terms precisely because frequency justifies a probability\nascription in the given case, but only probability confers legitimacy\non actions or contracts. In short, frequent occurrence might only have\nserved as indicator of endoxic probability for medieval scholastics.\nThe frequency of events may have prima facie justified the assumption\nthat everyone, a majority or the experts will believe that the events\nin question will occur.\n\nShould proto-frequentism therefore be dropped as a genuine concept of\nprobability? This step would be premature as long as the\ninterpretation of medieval ut frequenter statements is still\nbeing debated. Continuity with ancient notions of probability also\nsuggests that we should tread carefully. For this reason,\nproto-frequentism is included here among the medieval concepts of\nprobability.\n",
