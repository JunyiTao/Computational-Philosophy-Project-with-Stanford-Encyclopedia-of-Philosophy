    "main_text": "Varieties of Contemporary Panpsychism || Micropsychism Versus Cosmopsychism\n2.4 Micropsychism Versus Cosmopsychism\nContemporary philosophers tend to assume that fundamental things exist at the micro-level. Coleman (2006) calls this \u201csmallism\u201d: the view that facts about big things are grounded in facts about little things, e.g., the table exists and is the way it is because the particles making it up are related in certain extremely complicated ways. However, the work of Jonathan Schaffer (2010) has brought to prominence an alternative picture of reality. According to the view Schaffer calls \u201cpriority monism\u201d, facts about little things are grounded in facts about big things. The table\u2019s atoms exist and are the way they are because the table exists and is the way it is; and all things ultimately exist and are the way they are because of certain facts about the universe as a whole. For the priority monist there is one and only one fundamental thing: the universe.\nIf we combine priority monism with constitutive panpsychism we get:\n\nConstitutive cosmopsychism\u2014The view that all facts are grounded in/realized by/constituted of consciousness-involving facts at the cosmic-level.\n\nWe can also envisage non-constitutive forms of cosmopsychism. On a standard form of layered emergentism (discussed above), human and animal minds are causally dependent on consciousness-involving micro-level facts whilst being fundamental entities in their own right; on the cosmopsychist analogue, human and animal minds are causally dependent on the conscious cosmos whilst being fundamental entities in their own right.[13] The minimal commitment of cosmopsychism is that the universe is conscious; in principle this is compatible with holding that the universe is a derivative entity, grounded in facts about is parts.\nCosmopsychism is not to be confused with pantheism: the view that the universe is God.[14] Just as the micropsychist holds that electrons have experience but not thought, so the cosmopsychist holds that the universe has some kind of experience, but may refrain from attributing thought or agency to the universe. It could be that the consciousness of the universe is a gigantic mess that doesn\u2019t add up to anything coherent enough to ground cognition. Having said that, Philip Goff (2019) develops a form of cosmopsychism according to which the universe is a value-responding agent, in order to try to account for the fine-tuning of the laws of physics for life.\nDetailed forms of cosmopsychism have been proposed by Mathews (2011, 2020), Jaskolla & Buck (2012), Shani (2015, forthcoming), Nagasawa & Wager (2016), Goff (2017, 2020), and Shani and Kepler (2018). Most of these philosophers are attracted to cosmopsychism on the grounds that it is better fitted than micropsychism to deal with the combination problem (we will discuss some of their reasons for thinking this below in the section on the combination problem). Cosmopsychism is the contemporary analogue of the \u201csynecological\u201d forms of panpsychism, defended by Fechner and Royce amongst others, which were discussed above.\n",
