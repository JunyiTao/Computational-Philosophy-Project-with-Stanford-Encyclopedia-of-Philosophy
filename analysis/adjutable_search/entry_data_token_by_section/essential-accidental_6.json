    "main_text": "The Epistemology of Essentialist Claims\n7. Essentialist Claims in Arguments for Nonidentities\n\nLeibniz\u2019s Law of the Indiscernibility of Identicals, according\nto which, if \u201ctwo\u201d things are identical, then they share\nall their properties, can be used to argue for various claims of\nnonidentity. If you know, for example, that Charles is a philosophy\nmajor and that Yoko is not, then you can safely infer that Charles is\nnot identical to Yoko. Essentialist claims have played a role in some\nprominent Leibniz Law arguments for nonidentity theses. A certain\nbrand of mind-body dualism may be argued for in the following way:\n\\(X\\) is essentially a thinking thing; \\(X\\)\u2019s body is\nnot essentially a thinking thing; so \\(X\\) is not (identical to)\n\\(X\\)\u2019s body. A similar argument can be given for the\nconclusion that a statue is not identical with the lump of material\n(wax, clay, marble, or what have you) that constitutes it. Consider a\nhuman-shaped statue\u2014call it \u2018Goliath\u2019\u2014and the\nlump of wax that composes it\u2014call it\n\u2018Lump\\(_1\\)\u2019. Goliath, we may imagine, is throughout\nits entire existence composed of Lump\\(_1\\) while\nLump\\(_1\\) throughout its entire existence composes Goliath. In\nthis case, Goliath and Lump\\(_1\\) are spatiotemporally\ncolocated, which is just to say that they occupy the exact same\nspatial region at any given time whenever either of them exists. This\nbeing the case, they share most of their properties: Goliath weighs 17\nkilograms and so does Lump\\(_1\\); Goliath has a white surface\nand so does Lump\\(_1\\); and so on. In fact, it may seem curious\nthat we are writing as though there are two things at all.\nWhy not say simply that Goliath and Lump\\(_1\\) are identical?\nWell, it at least seems that a pretty straightforward\nargument\u2014one that relies on essentialist\nclaims\u2014establishes their nonidentity:\n\nGoliath is essentially human-shaped. \nLump\\(_1\\) is not essentially human-shaped.\nSo, Goliath is not identical to Lump\\(_1\\).\n\n\nThe plausibility of the two premises seems undeniable, given that we\nthink, for example, that if the room containing\nGoliath/Lump\\(_1\\) were to get really hot (hot enough to melt\nthe wax) and then to cool again (so that what was left was a lump of\nwax in the shape of something like a mountain), then Goliath would be\ndestroyed while Lump\\(_1\\) would still exist. And the reasoning\nlooks impeccable: if Goliath were Lump\\(_1\\), then each would\nhave to have all of the same properties as \u201cthe other\u201d;\nsince they have different properties, they must not be identical. (Few\nthings in philosophy are as uncontroversial as Leibniz\u2019s Law of\nthe Indiscernibility of Identicals, though there has been some dispute\nabout the proper way of formulating it.) Figuring out how to reconcile\nour intuitions that (1) and (2) are true with our tendency to think\nthat Goliath and Lump\\(_1\\) are not really two things but just\none is a version of the problem of material constitution.\nThere are a wide variety of ways to deal with this problem. A\n\u201ctwo-thinger\u201d\u2014one who thinks that there really are\ntwo things, a statue and a lump of wax, in one\nlocation\u2014may simply eschew the tendency to identify Goliath and\nLump\\(_1\\). Other responses suggest that there is something\namiss with Leibniz Law arguments for nonidentities when there is this\nkind of an appeal to essential properties: Della Rocca (1996c) holds\nthat such arguments are question begging; Lewis (1971) and Noonan\n(1991) hold that they are invalid; and Burke (1994) and Rea (2000)\nhold that in any such argument, at least one of the premises is false.\nFor those who are interested, Rea (1997) is a good place to start to\ndelve more deeply into this problem.\n",
