He\nrejected the codification of ethics into moral theories that views\nsuch as Kantianism and (above all) utilitarianism see as essential to\nphilosophical thinking about ethics, arguing that our ethical life is\ntoo untidy to be captured by any systematic moral theory. He was also\nan important contributor to debates on moral psychology, personal\nidentity, equality, morality and the emotions, and the interpretation\nof philosophers including Wittgenstein, Nietzsche, Descartes,\nAristotle, and Plato.\n\nWilliams\u2019 contributions were grounded in two overriding\ncommitments. First, he was deeply impressed by the importance of\nsubjective integrity or authenticity, and much of his work is\nessentially a sustained attempt to make sense of how moral theorizing\ncan avoid alienating individuals from their deepest values, cares and\nlife-projects. Second, this sustained attempt was made under the\numbrella of a variety of philosophical naturalism which was both\nanti-Platonic and anti-reductionist. He expressed these twin\ncommitments late in his life when he dreamed, wistfully, of \u201ca\nphilosophy that would be thoroughly truthful and honestly\nhelpful\u201d (2005: 212).\n\nIn what follows, we trace Williams\u2019 personal and philosophical\ndevelopment, beginning with a biographical summary and proceeding to a\ndiscussion of his most important ideas.\n", "toc": [{"#Biog": "1.

Biography\n\nBernard Williams was born in Essex in 1929, and educated at Chigwell\nSchool and Balliol College, Oxford, where he read Greats, the uniquely\nOxonian degree that begins with Homer and Vergil and concludes with\nThucydides, Tacitus, and (surprisingly perhaps) the latest in\ncontemporary philosophy. Both Williams\u2019 subject of study and his\ntutors, especially Richard Hare, remained as influences throughout his\nlife: the Greeks\u2019 sort of approach to philosophy never ceased to\nattract him, Hare\u2019s sort of approach never ceased to have the\nopposite effect. (Williams\u2019 contemporaries at Balliol, John\nLucas for example, still report their mischievous use of\n\u201ccombined tactics\u201d in philosophy tutorials with Hare; or\nperhaps the relevant preposition is \u201cagainst\u201d.)\n\nEarly in his career, Williams sat on a number of British government\ncommittees and commissions, most famously chairing the Committee on\nObscenity and Censorship of 1979, which applied Mill\u2019s\n\u201charm principle\u201d to the topic, concluding that\nrestrictions were out of place where no harm could reasonably be\nthought to be done, and that by and large society has other problems\nwhich are more worth worrying about. At this time, he also began to\npublish books. His first book, Morality: an introduction to\nethics (1972), already announced many of the themes that were to\nbe central to his work. Already evident, in particular, were his\nquestioning attitude to the whole enterprise of moral theory, his\ncaution about the notion of absolute truth in ethics, and his\nhostility to utilitarianism and other moral theories that seek to\nsystematise moral life and experience on the basis of such an\nabsolute; as he later put it, \u201cThere cannot be any very\ninteresting, tidy or self-contained theory of what morality is\u2026\nnor\u2026 can there be an ethical theory, in the sense of a\nphilosophical structure which, together with some degree of empirical\nfact, will yield a decision procedure for moral reasoning\u201d\n(1981: ix-x). His second book, Problems of the Self (= PS;\n1973), was a collection of his philosophical papers from 1956 to 1972;\nhis further collections of essays (Moral Luck, 1981, and\nMaking Sense of Humanity, 1998) were as much landmarks in the\nliterature as this first collection. (Posthumously three further\ncollections appeared: In the Beginning was the Deed (ed.\nGeoffrey Hawthorn), 2005, A Sense of the Past, 2005, and\nPhilosophy as a Humanistic Discipline (2006); at least the\nsecond and third of these three collections are already having a\nconsiderable impact on philosophy, partly because they include essays\nthat were already well-known and widely discussed in their original\nplaces of appearance.) In 1973 Williams also brought out a co-authored\nvolume, Utilitarianism: For and Against, with J.J.C.Smart (=\nUFA); his contribution to this (the Against bit) being, in\nthe present writer\u2019s view, a tour de force of\nphilosophical demolition. Then in 1978 Williams produced\nDescartes: The Project of Pure Enquiry. This study could be\ndescribed as his most substantial work outside ethics, but for the\nfact that the key theme of the book is the impossibility of\nDescartes\u2019 ambition to give a foundation, in the first-personal\nperspective, to the \u201cabsolute conception\u201d of the world, a\nrepresentation of the world \u201cas it is anyway\u201d that\nincludes, explains, and rationally interrelates all other possible\nrepresentations of the world (Williams 1968: 65)\u2014a theme that is\nin an important sense not outside ethics at all.\n\n\nWilliams worked in Britain until 1987, when he left \n\nfor Berkeley in protest at the impact of the Thatcher\ngovernment\u2019s policies on British universities. In 1985, he\npublished the book that offers the most unified and sustained\npresentation of what Williams had to say about ethics and human life:\nEthics and the Limits of Philosophy. On his return to Britain\nin 1990 (incidentally the year of Mrs. Thatcher\u2019s resignation)\nhe succeeded his old tutor Richard Hare as White\u2019s Professor of\nMoral Philosophy at Oxford. While in the Oxford chair he produced\nShame and Necessity (1993), a major study of Greek ethics\nwhich aims to distinguish what we think about ethics \u201cfrom what\nwe think that we think\u201d (1993: 91): Williams\u2019 thesis is\nthat our deepest convictions are often more like classical Greek\nethical thought, and less like the post-Enlightenment \u201cmorality\nsystem\u201d, as Williams came to call it, than most of us have yet\nrealised. (More about the morality system in sections 2 and 3.)\n\nIn 1999 he published an introductory book on Plato\n(Routledge). After 1999\u2014when he was knighted\u2014he began to\nbe affected by the cancer which eventually killed him, but was still\nable to bring out Truth and Truthfulness in 2002. In this\nWilliams argues, against such deniers of the possibility or importance\nof objective truth as the pragmatist Richard Rorty and the\ndeconstructionist Jacques Derrida, that it is indispensable to any\nhuman society to accept both truth and truthfulness as values, and\nsincerity and accuracy as corresponding virtues. Nor need such beliefs\nimply anything disreputably \u201cmetaphysical\u201d, in the\nNietzschean sense that they lead us into a covert worship of what\nWilliams takes to be the will o\u2019 the wisps of theism or\nPlatonism. On the contrary, Williams argues, Nietzsche is on his side,\nnot the deniers\u2019, because Nietzsche himself believes that, while\na vindicatory history of the notions of truth and truthfulness\ncertainly has to be a naturalistic one, that is not to say that such a\nhistory is impossible. We can write this history if we can supply a\n\u201cpotential explanation\u201d, to use Robert Nozick\u2019s term\n(Nozick 1974: 7\u20139), of how these notions could have arisen.\nWilliams himself attempts to provide such a potential explanation,\nwhich if plausible will\u2014given the impossibility of recovering\nthe actual history\u2014provide us with as much insight as we can\nreasonably hope for into how the notions of truth and truthfulness did\nin fact arise. Such an understanding of truth and truthfulness,\nWilliams concludes, cannot lead us back into the pre-modern\nphilosophical Edens where truth and truthfulness are taken to have\ntheir origin in something entirely transcendent, such as Plato\u2019s\nForms, or God, or the cognitive powers of the Kantian subject; but it\ncan lead us to the less elevated and more realistic hope that truth,\nas a human institution, will continue to sustain the virtues of truth\n\u201cin something like the more courageous, intransigent, and\nsocially effective forms that they have acquired over their\nhistory\u2026 and that the ways in which future people will come to\nmake sense of things will enable them to see the truth and not be\nbroken by it\u201d (2002: 269). However, it should be noted that\nWilliams, perhaps confusingly, claims to have vindicated the idea that\ntruthfulness is an intrinsic value, \nwhile at the same time admitting that his genealogical explanation for\nthe emergence of truthfulness only makes reference to what\ntruthfulness effects or accomplishes. Difficult questions remain about\nhis use of the Platonic category of \u2018intrinsic value\u2019 here\n(see Rorty 2002, Queloz 2018).\n\nSome of Williams\u2019 critics have complained that his work is\nlargely \u201cdestructive\u201d or \u201cnegative\u201d. Part of\nWilliams\u2019 reply is that his nuanced and particularistic approach\nto ethics\u2014via the detail of ethical questions\u2014is\nnegative only from the point of view of those operating under a\ncompletely undefended assumption. This is the assumption that, if\nthere is to be serious ethical thought, then it must inevitably take\nthe form of moral theory. The impression that any other approach could\nnot be more than \u201cnegative\u201d is itself part of the mindset\nthat he is attacking.\n\nWilliams often also meets the charge of negativity with a\ncounter-offensive, which can be summarised as the retort that\nthere\u2019s plenty to be negative about (1995: 217). \u201cOften,\nsome theory has been under criticism, and the more particular material\n[e.g. Williams\u2019 famous examples (UFA: 93\u2013100) of George\nand Jim: see section 4 below] has come in to remind one of the\nunreality and, worse, distorting quality of the theory. The\nmaterial\u2026 is itself extremely schematic, but\u2026 it at\nleast brings out the basic point that\u2026 the theory is frivolous,\nin not allowing for anyone\u2019s experience, including the\nauthor\u2019s own. Alternatively, the theory does represent\nexperience, but an impoverished experience, which it holds up as the\nrational norm\u2014that is to say, the theory is stupid.\u201d\n\nBut Williams did publish positive and constructive philosophy, most\nnotably in Truth and Truthfulness itself. Moreover, this\nconception of Williams as a negative thinker is contestible. Miranda\nFricker argues that Williams work represents an affirmation of what\nshe calls \u201cethical freedom\u201d, which follows from the\nrecognition that rationality itself significantly underdetermines how\nwe should live (Fricker 2020). If the Platonic dream is that objective\nreason can always give us sufficient practical guidance, then Williams\nnegative position is that this ambitious form of rationalism must\nfail. The correlative positive idea is that each agent has a certain\nkind of subjective freedom to shape their own conceptions of\nsuccessful action and of the good life, conceptions which are not\nsubject to censure or approval by some kind of universal rationality.\nIt is important to notice that this only appears to be a negative\nthesis because we are assuming that a positive contribution to moral\nphilosophy consists in establishing universal limits or boundaries on\njustified action. But from the perspective of the deciding agent,\nWilliams\u2019 thesis is anything but negative; rather, it is\npositively liberating, freeing agents to shape their own projects in\naccordance with their own character.\n\nSince one of Williams\u2019 main objectives is to demonstrate the\nfrivolity and/ or stupidity of too much contemporary moral theory, it\nis natural to structure our more detailed examination of his\ncontributions to philosophy by beginning with its critical side. The\nfirst two of the three themes from Williams that we pick for closer\nattention are both campaigns of argument against positions:\nrespectively, against the \u201cmorality system\u201d (sections 2\nand 3), and against utilitarianism (section 4). The aptness of this\narrangement comes out in the fact that, as we shall see, most of the\nconstructive positions that Williams adopts can be seen as the\n\u201cmorals\u201d of these essentially destructive stories. Even\nwhat we take to be Williams\u2019 single most important positive\nthesis, a view about the nature of motivation and reasons for action,\nemerges from his critique of other people\u2019s views about reasons\nfor action; more about that, his famous \u201cinternal reasons\u201d\nargument, in section 5.\n2. Williams and Moral Philosophy\n\nIn the Preface to Williams\u2019 first book he notes the charge\nagainst contemporary moral philosophy \u201cthat it is peculiarly\nempty and boring\u201d.\n [1].\n Moral philosophy, he claims, has found an original way of being\nboring: and this is \u201cby not discussing moral issues at\nall.\u201d\n\nCertainly, this charge is no longer as fair now as it was in 1972.\nToday there is an entire discipline called \u201capplied\u201d or\n\u201cpractical\u201d ethics, not to mention sub-disciplines called\nenvironmental, business, sport, media, healthcare, and medical ethics,\nto the extent that hardly any moral issues are not discussed\nby philosophers nowadays. However, while some or even many\nphilosophers today do applied ethics by applying some general,\nabstract theory, a problem with many of them, as Williams pointed out\nin an interview in 1983, is that those who proceed in this way often\nseem to lose any real interest in the perspectives of the human beings\nwho must actually live with a moral problem:\n\nI do think it is perfectly proper for some philosophers all of the\ntime and for other philosophers some of the time to be engaged in\ntechnical issues, without having to worry all the time whether their\nwork is going to revolutionise our view of the employment situation,\nor something of that kind. Indeed, without criticising any particular\nthinkers or publicists, a problem with \u201capplied ethics\u201d is\nthat some people have a bit of ready-made philosophical theory, and\nthey whiz in, a bit like hospital auxiliary personnel who aren\u2019t\nactually doctors. That kind of applied philosophy isn\u2019t even\n half-interesting\u2026[2]\n\n\nHe continues:\n\n\u2026the temptation is to find a way to apply philosophy to\nimmediate and practical problems and to do so by arguing about those\nproblems in a legalistic way. You are tempted to make your moral\nphilosophy course into a quasi-legal course\u2026 All the\nphilosophical journals are full of issues about women\u2019s rights,\nabortion, social justice, and so on. But an awful lot of it consists\nof what can be called in the purely technical sense a kind of\ncasuistry, an application of certain moral systems or principles or\ntheories to discussing what we should think about abortion.\n\n\nWe are now able to see how Williams conceived of the relation between\nphilosophy and lived ethical experience. He firmly believed that\nphilosophy should speak to that experience, on pain of being\n\u201cempty and boring\u201d. But he did not think that we should\nfollow the moral philosophers of his day in preferring the schematic\nover the detailed, or the general over the particular. Here, Williams\njoins a long critical tradition that stretches at least back to G.W.F.\nHegel, whose own claim that Kant\u2019s moral theory was\n\u201cempty\u201d is importantly related to Williams\u2019 own\ncharge against moral theorizing. Moreover, as a general criticism of\nmoral philosophy, this point arguably remains quite correct even\n today.[3]\n Bearing this general orientation in mind, we now turn to a discussion\nof Williams\u2019 more determinate charges against various types of\nmoral theory.\n3. Against the \u201cpeculiar institution\u201d\n\nThe unwillingness to be drawn into discussing particular ethical\nissues that Williams complains of was a reflection of earlier\ndevelopments. In particular, it was a reflection of the logical\npositivists\u2019 disdain for \u201cmoralising\u201d, a disdain\nwhich arose naturally from the emotivist conviction of philosophers\nsuch as A.J.Ayer that to utter one\u2019s first-order moral beliefs\nwas to say nothing capable of truth or falsehood, but simply to\nexpress one\u2019s attitudes, and hence not a properly\nphilosophical activity at all. More properly philosophical,\non emotivist and similar views, was a research-programme that became\nabsolutely dominant during the 1950s and 1960s in Anglophone\nphilosophy, including moral philosophy. This was linguistic analysis\nin the post-Wittgensteinian style of J.L.Austin, who hoped, starting\nfrom an examination of the way we talk (whoever \u201cwe\u201d may\nbe: more on that in a minute), to reveal the deep structure of a wide\nvariety of philosophically interesting phenomena: among the most\nsuccessful applications of Austin\u2019s method were his studies of\nintention, other minds, and responsibility.\n\nWhen Ayer\u2019s dislike of preaching and Austin\u2019s method of\nlinguistic analysis were combined in moral philosophy, one notable\n result[4]\n was Richard Hare\u2019s \u201cuniversal presciptivism\u201d, a\nmoral system which claimed to derive the form of all first-order moral\nutterances simply from linguistic analysis of the two little words\n\u201cought\u201d and \u201cgood\u201d. Hare argued that it\nfollowed from the logic of these terms, when used in their full or\nspecially moral sense, that moral utterances were (1) distinct from\nother utterances in being, not assertions about how the world is, but\nprescriptions about how we think it ought to be; and (2) distinct from\nother prescriptions in being universalisable, by which Hare\nmeant that anyone who was willing to make such a prescription about\nany agent, e.g. himself, should be equally willing to make it about\nany other similarly-placed agent. In this way Hare\u2019s theory\npreserved the important emotivist thesis that a person\u2019s moral\ncommitments are not rationally challengeable for their content, but\nonly for their coherence with that person\u2019s other moral\ncommitments\u2014and thus tended to keep philosophical attention away\nfrom questions about the content of such\n commitments.[5]\n At the same time, his system was also able to accommodate a central\npart of the Kantian outlook, because it gave a\n rationale[6]\n for the twin views that moral commitments are overriding as\nmotivations (so that they will motivate if present), and that\nthey are overriding as rational justifications (so that they\nrationally must motivate if they are present). Hence cases\nlike akrasia, where a moral commitment appears to be present\nin an agent but gets overridden by something else along the way to\naction, must on Hare\u2019s view be cases where something has gone\nwrong: either the agent is irrational, or else she has not really\nuttered a full-blown moral ought, a properly moral\ncommitment, either because (1) the prescription that she claims to\naccept is not really one that she accepts at all, or (2) because\nalthough she does sincerely accept this prescription, she is not\nprepared to give it a fully universalised form, and hence does not\naccept it as a distinctively moral prescription.\n\nIn assessing a position like Hare\u2019s, Williams and other critics\noften begin with the formidable difficulties involved in the project\nof deducing anything much about the structure of morality from the\nlogic of moral language: see e.g., Geach, \u201cGood and Evil\u201d,\nAnalysis 1956, and Williams 1972: 52\u201361. These\ndifficulties are especially acute when the moral language we consider\nis basically just the words \u201cought\u201d and \u201cgood\u201d\nand their opposites. \u201cIf there is to be attention to language,\nthen there should be attention to more of it\u201d (Williams 1985:\n127); the closest Williams comes to inheriting the ambitions of\nlinguistic analysis is his defence of the notion of morally\n\u201cthick concepts\u201d (1985:\n 140\u2013143)[7].\n These\u2014Williams gives coward, lie, brutality and\ngratitude as examples\u2014are concepts that sustain an\nethical load of a culturally-conditioned form, and hence succeed both\nin being action-guiding (for members of that culture), and in making\navailable (to members of that culture) something that can reasonably\nbe described as ethical knowledge. Given that my society has\narrived at the concept of brutality, that is to say has got clear, at\nleast implicitly, about the circumstances under which it is or is not\napplicable, there can be facts about brutality (hence,\nethical facts) and also justified true\n beliefs[8]\n about brutality (hence, ethical knowledge). Moreover, this knowledge\ncan be lost, and will be lost, if the concept and its social context\nis lost. (For a strikingly similar philosophical project to that\nsuggested by this talk of thick concepts, cp. Anscombe 1958a, and\nPhilippa Foot\u2019s papers \u201cMoral Beliefs\u201d and\n\u201cMoral Arguments\u201d, both in her Virtues and\nVices.)\n\nBefore we even get to the problem how the structure of morality is\nsupposed to follow from moral language, there is the prior question\n\u201cWhose moral language?\u201d; and this is a deeper\nquestion. We do not suppose that all moral language (not even\u2014to\ngesture towards an obviously enormous difficulty\u2014all moral\nlanguage in English) has always and everywhere had\nexactly the same presuppositions, social context, or cultural\nsignificance. So why we should suppose that moral language has always\nand everywhere had exactly the same meaning, and has always been\nequally amenable to the analysis of its logical structure offered by\nHare? (Or by anyone else: it can hardly be insignificant that when\nG.E.Moore (Principia Ethica sections 17, 89) anticipated Hare by\noffering a linguistic analysis of \u201cgood\u201d, his analysis of\nthis term was on the face of it quite different from Hare\u2019s,\ndespite Moore\u2019s extreme historical and cultural proximity to\nHare.) Basing moral objectivism on the foundations of a linguistic\napproach leaves it more vulnerable to relativistic worries than other\nfoundations do. For on the linguistic approach, we also face a\nquestion of authority, the question why, even if something like the\noffered analysis of our moral language were correct, that should\nlicense us to think that the moral language of our society\nhas any kind of universal jurisdiction over any\nsociety\u2019s. In its turn, this question is very apt to breed the\nfurther question how, if our moral language lacks this universal\njurisdiction over other societies, it can make good its claim to\njurisdiction even in our society.\n\nThese latter points about authority are central to Williams\u2019\ncritique of contemporary moral philosophy. Like Anscombe before him,\nWilliams argues that the analysts\u2019 tight focus on such words as\n\u201cought\u201d, \u201cright\u201d, and \u201cgood\u201d has\ncome, in moral theory, to give those words (when used in their alleged\n\u201cspecial moral sense\u201d) an air of authority which they\ncould only earn against a moral and religious backdrop\u2014roughly,\nthe Christian world-view\u2014that is nowadays largely missing. What\nWilliams takes to be the correct verdict on modern moral theory is\ntherefore rather like Nietzsche\u2019s on George\n Eliot:[9]\n the idea that morality can and will go on just as before in the\nabsence of religious belief is simply an illusion that reflects a lack\nof \u201chistorical sense\u201d. As\n Anscombe[10]\n puts it (1958: 30), \u201cit is not possible to have a [coherent law\nconception of ethics] unless you believe in God as a law-giver\u2026\nIt is as if the notion \u2018criminal\u2019 were to remain when\ncriminal law and criminal courts had been abolished and\nforgotten.\u201d And as Williams puts it (1985: 38), the\n\u201cvarious features of the moral judgement system support each\nother, and collectively they are modelled on the prerogatives of a\nPelagian God.\u201d\n\nWhat then are these features? That is a big question, because Williams\nspent pretty well his whole career describing and criticising them.\nBut he gives his most straightforward, and perhaps the definitive,\nsummary of what the \u201cmorality system\u201d comes to in the last\nchapter of Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy. (The\nchapter\u2019s title provocatively describes morality as \u201cthe\npeculiar institution\u201d, this phrase being the American\nConfederacy\u2019s standard euphemism for\n slavery.[11])\n\nFollowing this account, we may venture to summarise the\n\u201cmorality system\u201d in nine leading\n theses.[12]\nFirst, the morality system is essentially practical:\nmy moral obligations are always things that I can do, so that\n\u201cif my deliberation issues in something that I cannot do, then I\nmust deliberate again\u201d (1985: 175). This implies,\nsecond, that moral obligations cannot (really)\nconflict (185: 176). Third, the system includes a\npressure towards generalisation which Williams calls \u201cthe\nobligation out-obligation in principle\u201d: this is the\nview that every particular moral obligation needs the logical backing\nof a general moral obligation, of which it is to be explained as an\ninstance. Fourth, \u201cmoral obligation is\ninescapable\u201d (185: 177): \u201cthe fact that a given agent\nwould prefer not to be in [the morality] system will not excuse\nhim\u201d, because moral considerations are, in some sense like the\nsenses sharpened up by Kant and by Hare, overriding\nconsiderations. In any deliberative contest between a moral obligation\nand some other consideration, the moral obligation will always win\nout, according to the morality system. The only thing that\ncan trump an obligation is another obligation (1985: 180);\nthis is a fifth thesis of the morality system, and it\ncreates pressure towards a sixth, that as many as\npossible of the considerations that we find practically important\nshould be represented as moral obligations, and that considerations\nthat cannot take the form of obligations cannot really be important\nafter all (1985: 179). Seventh, there is a view about\nthe impossibility of \u201cmoral luck\u201d that we might call, as\nWilliams calls it, the \u201cpurity of morality\u201d (1985:\n195\u20136): \u201cmorality makes people think that, without its\nvery special obligation, there is only inclination; without its utter\nvoluntariness, there is only force; without its ultimately pure\njustice, there is no justice\u201d; whereas \u201cin truth\u201d,\nWilliams insists, \u201calmost all worthwhile human life lies between\nthe extremes that morality puts before us\u201d (1985: 194).\nEighth, \u201cblame is the characteristic reaction\nof the morality system\u201d to a failure to meet one of its\nobligations (1985: 177); and \u201cblame of anyone is directed to the\nvoluntary\u201d (1985: 178). Ninth, and finally, the\nmorality system is impersonal. We shall set this last feature of the\nsystem aside until section 4, and focus, for now, on the other\neight.\n\nFor each of the theses, Williams has something (at least one thing) of\ndeep interest to say about why we should reject it. The\nfirst and second\u2014about the\npracticality of morality and the impossibility of real\nconflict\u2014are his target in his well-known early paper\n\u201cEthical Consistency\u201d (PS: 166\u2013186). In real life,\nWilliams argues, there surely are cases where we find ourselves under\nethical demands which conflict. These conflicts are not always\neliminable in the way that the morality system requires them always to\nbe\u2014by arguments leading to the conclusion that one of the\noughts was only prima facie (in Ross\u2019s\nterminology: see Williams 1985: 176\u2013177), or pro tanto\n(in a more recent terminology: see Kagan 1989), or in some other way\neliminable from our moral accounting. But, Williams argues, \u201cit\nis surely falsifying of moral\n thought[13]\n to represent its logic as demanding that in a conflict\u2026 one of\nthe conflicting oughts must be totally rejected [on the\ngrounds that] it did not actually apply\u201d (PS:\n 183\u20134).[14]\n For the fact that it did actually apply is registered by all sorts of\nfacts in our moral experience, including the very important phenomenon\nof ineliminable agent-regret, regret not just that something happened,\nbut that it was me who made it happen (1981: 27\u201330).\n\nSuppose for\n example[15]\n that I, an officer of a wrecked ship, take the hard decision to\nactively prevent further castaways from climbing onto my already\ndangerously overcrowded lifeboat. Afterwards, I am tormented when I\nremember how I smashed the spare oar repeatedly over the heads and\nhands of desperate, drowning people. Yet what I did certainly brought\nit about that as many people as possible were saved from the\nshipwreck, so that a utilitarian would say that I brought about the\nbest consequences, and anyone might agree that I found the only\npracticable way of avoiding a dramatically worse outcome. Moreover, as\na Kantian might point out, there was nothing unfair or\nmalicious about what I did in using the minimum force\nnecessary to repel further boarders: my aim, since I could not save\nevery life, was to save those who by no choice of mine just happened\nto be in the lifeboat already; this was an aim that I properly had,\ngiven my role as a ship\u2019s officer; and it was absolutely not my\nintention to kill or (perhaps) even to injure anyone.\n\nSo what will typical advocates of the morality system have to say to\nme afterwards about my dreadful sense of\n regret?[16]\n If they are\u2014as perhaps they had better not be\u2014totally\nconsistent and totally honest with me, what they will have to say is\nsimply \u201cDon\u2019t give it a second thought; you did what\nmorality required, so your deep anguish about it is irrational.\u201d\nAnd that, surely, cannot be the right thing for anyone to say. My\nanguish is not irrational but entirely justified. Moreover, it is\njustified simply as an ex post facto response to what I did:\nit does not for instance depend for its propriety upon the\nsuggestion\u2014a characteristic one, for many modern moral\ntheorists\u2014that there is prospective value for the future in my\nbeing the kind of person who will have such reactions.\n\nThe third thesis Williams mentions as a part of the\nmorality system is the obligation out-obligation in\nprinciple, the view that every particular moral obligation needs the\nbacking of a general moral obligation, of which it is to be explained\nas an instance. Williams argues that this thesis will typically engage\nthe deliberating agent in commitments that he should not have. For one\nthing, the principle commits the agent to an implausibly demanding\nview of morality (1985: 181\u2013182):\n\nThe immediate claim on me, \u201cIn this emergency, I am under an\nobligation to help\u201d, is thought to come from, \u201cOne is\nunder this general obligation: to help in an emergency\u201d\u2026\nBut once the journey into more general obligations has started, we may\nbegin to get into trouble\u2014not just philosophical trouble, but\nconscience trouble\u2014with finding room for morally indifferent\nactions\u2026 if we have accepted general and indeterminate\nobligations to further various moral objectives\u2026 they will be\nwaiting to provide work for idle hands, and the thought can gain a\nfooting that\u2026 I am under an obligation not to waste time in\ndoing things that I am under no obligation to do. At this stage,\ncertainly, only an obligation can beat an obligation [cp. the\nfourth thesis], and in order to do what I wanted to\ndo, I shall need one of those fraudulent items, a duty to myself.\n\n\nIt is only the pressure to systematise that leads us to infer that, if\nit is X\u2019s particular obligation in S to \u03c6,\nthen this must be because there is a general obligation, on any\nX-like agent, to \u03c6 in any S-like\n situation.[17]\n Unless some systematic account of morality is true\u2014as Williams\nof course denies\u2014there is no obvious reason why this inference\nmust hold in any more than trivial sense. But even if it does hold, it\nis not clear how the general duty explains the particular\none; why are general obligations any more explanatory than particular\nones? Certainly anyone who is puzzled as to why there is this\nparticular obligation, say to rescue one\u2019s wife, is unlikely to\nfind it very illuminating to be pointed towards the general obligation\nof which it is meant to be an instance. (Williams\u2019 closeness to\ncertain particularist strategies should be obvious here: cp. Dancy\n2004, and Chappell 2005.)\n\nAnother inappropriate commitment arising from the obligation\nout-obligation in principle, famously spelled out at 1981: 18, is\nthe agent\u2019s commitment to a \u201cthought too many\u201d. If\nan agent is in a situation where he has to choose which of two people\nto rescue from some catastrophe, and chooses the one of the two people\nwho is his wife, then \u201cit might have been hoped by some people\n(for instance, by his wife) that his motivating thought, fully spelled\nout, would be the thought that it was his wife, not that it was his\nwife and that in situations of this kind it is permissible to save\none\u2019s wife.\u201d The morality system, Williams is suggesting,\nmakes nonsense of the agent\u2019s action in rescuing his wife: its\ninsistence on generality obscures the particular way in which this\naction is really justified for the agent. Its real justification has\nnothing to do with the impersonal and impartial standards of morality,\nand everything to do with the place in the agent\u2019s life of the\nperson he chooses to rescue. For Williams, the standard of \u201cwhat\nmakes life meaningful\u201d is always deeper and more genuinely\nexplanatory than the canon of moral obligation; the point is central,\nand we shall come back to it below in sections 3 and 4.\n\nWilliams\u2019 opposition to the fourth thesis,\nabout the inescapability of morality, rests on the closely-related\ncontrast he draws between moral considerations, and considerations\nabout \u201cimportance\u201d: \u201cethical life is important, but\nit can see that things other than itself are important\u201d (1985:\n184). This notion of importance is grounded, ultimately, in the fact\n\u201cthat each person has a life to lead\u201d (1985: 186). What is\nimportant, in this sense, is whatever humans need to make it possible\nto lead what can reasonably be recognised as meaningful lives; the\nnotion of importance is of ethical use because, and insofar as, it\nreflects the facts about \u201cwhat we can understand men as needing\nand wanting\u201d (1972: 95). The notion that moral obligation is\ninescapable is undermined by careful attention to this concept of\nimportance, simply because reflection shows that the notion of moral\nobligation will have to be grounded in the notion of importance if it\nis to be grounded in anything that is not simply illusory. But if it\nis grounded in that, then it cannot itself be the only thing that\nmatters. Hence moral obligation cannot be inescapable, which refutes\nthe fourth thesis of the morality system; other\nconsiderations can sometimes override or trump an obligation without\nthemselves being obligations, which refutes the\nfifth; and there can be no point in trying to\nrepresent every practically important consideration as a moral\nobligation, so that it is for instance a distortion for Ross (The\nRight and The Good, 21 ff.) to talk of \u201cduties of\ngratitude\u201d (1985: 181); which refutes the\nsixth.\n\nIt is worth noting that the fourth thesis,\nthat morality is inescapable for all agents in all\nsituations, has implications beyond the realm of personal ethics.\nWilliams\u2019 most enduring contribution to political philosophy is\nhis denial of political moralism, the view that that politics\nis always and everywhere regulated by morality. The result is his\ncelebrated political realist position, which denies that legitimate\npolitics can just consist in the systematic application of some moral\ntheory or principle. Rather, for Williams, the basic political\nquestion is: can the state secure the bare conditions of \u201corder,\nprotection, safety, trust, and the conditions of cooperation\u201d?\nIf so, it has met the Basic Legitimation Demand, which is not\na moral demand but rather a kind of precondition for the existence of\npolitics at all. For Williams, all of this means that political\nnormativity stands outside of the morality system (IBD, ch.1). More\nconcretely, this means that certain kinds of considerations\ndistinctive to politics must be allowed to retain self-standing\npractical significance. We might illustrate this thought by noting\nthat in the realm of ordinary interpersonal ethics, it seems perfectly\nreasonable to try to reduce or minimize coercive relations, whereas in\npolitics this demand is nonsensical, since politics begins with the\nquestion of how a governing body\u2019s coercive power ought to be\ndeployed.\n\nPolitical philosophy aside, Williams also denies that personal\ndecision-making must always and everywhere be regulated by moral\nnormativity. Another vivid instance of the escapability of moral\nobligations is Williams\u2019 own example of \u201cGauguin\u201d, a\n(fictionalised) artist who deliberately rejects a whole host of moral\nobligations (to his family, for instance) because he finds it more\n\u201cimportant\u201d, in this sense, to be a painter. As Williams\ncomments (1981: 23), \u201cWhile we are sometimes guided by the\nnotion that it would be the best of worlds in which morality were\nuniversally respected and all men were of a disposition to affirm it,\nwe have, in fact, deep and persistent reasons to be grateful that that\nis not the world we have\u201d; in other words, moral obligation is\nescapable because it is not in the deepest human interest that it\nshould be inescapable. (\u201cBecause\u201d: the fact that this sort\nof inference is possible in ethics is itself a revealing fact about\nthe nature of ethics.)\n\nWilliams\u2019 Gauguin example, we have suggested, has force against\nthe thesis that morality is inescapable. It also has force against the\nseventh thesis of the morality system, its insistence\non \u201cpurity\u201d and its denial of what Williams calls\n\u201cmoral luck\u201d. To understand this notion, begin with the\nfamiliar legal facts that attempted murder is a different and less\ngrave offence than murder, and that dangerous driving typically does\nnot attract the same legal penalty if no one is actually hurt.\nInhabitants of the morality system will characteristically be puzzled\nby this distinction. How can it be right to assign different levels of\nblame, and different punishments, to two agents whose mens\nrea was exactly the same\u2014it was just that one would-be\nmurderer dropped the knife and the other didn\u2019t\u2014or to two\nequally reckless motorists\u2014one of whom just happened to miss the\npedestrians while the other just happened to hit them?\n\nOne traditional answer\u2014much favoured by the\nutilitarians\u2014is that these sorts of thoughts only go to show\nthat the point of blame and punishment is prospective\n(deterrence-based), not retrospective (desert-based). There are\nreasons for thinking that blame and punishment cannot be made sense of\nin this instrumental fashion (cp. UFA: 124, 1985: 178). \u201cFrom\nthe inside\u201d, both notions seem essentially retrospective, so\nthat if a correct understanding of them said that they were really\nfictions serving a prospective social function, no one who knew that\ncould continue to use these notions \u201cfrom the inside\u201d:\nthat is, the notions would have proved unstable under reflection for\nthis person, who would thereby have lost some ethical knowledge. If\nthis gambit fails, another answer\u2014favoured by Kantians, but\navailable to utilitarians too\u2014is that the law would need to\nengage in an impossible degree of mind-reading to pick up all and only\nthose cases of mens rea that deserve punishment irrespective\nof the outcomes. Even if this is the right thing to say about the law,\nthe answer cannot be transposed to the case of morality: morality\ncontrasts with the law precisely because it is supposed to apply even\nto the inner workings of the mind. Thus, morality presumably ought to\nbe just as severe on the attempted murderer and the reckless but lucky\nmotorist as it is on their less fortunate doubles.\n\nWilliams has a different answer to the puzzle why we blame people more\nwhen they are successful murderers, or not only reckless but lethal\nmotorists, despite the fact that they have no voluntary control over\ntheir success as murderers or their lethality as motorists. His answer\nis that\u2014despite what the morality system tells us\u2014our\npractice of blame is not in fact tied exclusively to voluntary\ncontrol. We blame people not only for what they have\nvoluntarily done, but also for what they have done as a\nmatter of luck: we might also say, of their moral luck.\nThe way we mostly think about these matters often does not distinguish\nthese two elements of control and luck at all clearly\u2014as is also\nwitnessed by the important possibility of blaming people for what they\nare. These phenomena, Williams argues, help to reveal the\nbasic unclarity of our notion of the voluntary; they also help to show\nhow \u201cwhat we think\u201d about blame is not always the same as\n\u201cwhat we think we think\u201d.\n\nParallel points apply with praise. Someone like the Gauguin of\nWilliams\u2019 story can be seen as taking a choice of the demands of\nart over the obligations of family life which will be praiseworthy or\nblameworthy depending on how it turns out (\u201cThe only\nthing that will justify his choice will be success itself\u201d,\n1981: 23). Here success or failure is quite beyond Gauguin\u2019s\nvoluntary control, and thus, if the morality system were right, would\nhave to be beyond the scope of praise and blame as well. A fault-line\nin our notions of praise and blame is revealed by the fact that,\nintuitively, it is not: the case where Gauguin tries and fails to be\nan artist is one where we condemn him \u201cfor making such a mess of\nhis and others\u2019 lives\u201d, the case where he tries and\nsucceeds is, very likely, one where we say, a little grudgingly\nperhaps, \u201cWell, all right then \u2014 well done.\u201d We have\nthe morality system\u2019s narrow or \u201cpure\u201d versions of\nthese notions, in which they apply only to (a narrow or\n\u201cpure\u201d version of) the voluntary; but we also have a wider\nversion of the notions of praise and blame, in which they also apply\nto many things that are not voluntary on any account of the voluntary.\nWilliams\u2019 thesis about moral luck is that the wider notions are\nmore useful, and truer to experience. (For a sustained defense of\nWilliams on these basic points, see Joseph Raz \u201cAgency and\nLuck\u201d)\n\nNor is it only praise and blame that are in this way less tightly\nconnected to conditions about voluntariness than the morality system\nmakes them seem. Beyond the notion of blame lie other, equally\nethically important, notions such as regret or even anguish at\none\u2019s actions; and these notions need not show any tight\nconnection with voluntariness either. As we saw in my shipwreck\nexample above, the mere fact that it was unreasonable to expect the\nship\u2019s officer to do much better than he did in his desperate\ncircumstances does not make it reasonable to fob off his anguish with\n\u201cDon\u2019t give it a second thought\u201d. Likewise, to use\nan example of Williams\u2019 own (1981: 28), if you were talking to a\ndriver who through no fault of his own had run over a child, there\nwould be something remarkably obtuse\u2014something irrelevant and\nsuperficial, even if correct\u2014about telling him that he\nshouldn\u2019t feel bad about it provided it wasn\u2019t\nhis fault. As the Greeks knew, such terrible happenings will leave\ntheir mark, their miasma, on the agent. \u201cThe whole of\nthe Oedipus Tyrannus, that dreadful machine, moves towards\nthe discovery of just one thing, that he did it. Do we\nunderstand the terror of that discovery only because we residually\nshare magical beliefs in blood-guilt, or archaic notions of\nresponsibility? Certainly not: we understand it because we know that\nin the story of one\u2019s life there is an authority exercised by\nwhat one has done, and not merely by what one has intentionally\ndone\u201d (1993: 69).\n\nThis sums up Williams\u2019 case for thinking that the wider notion\nof praise and blame is tenable in a way that the narrower notion is\nnot because of its dependence on a questionably \u201cpure\u201d\naccount of the voluntary (1985: 194; cp. MSH Essays 1\u20133). In\nthis way, he controverts the eighth thesis of the\nmorality system, its insistence on the centrality of blame; which was\nthe last thesis that we listed apart from impersonality, the\ndiscussion of which we have postponed till the next section.\n\nSo much on Williams\u2019 critique of the \u201cmorality\nsystem\u201d. How far our discussion has delivered on its promise to\nshow how Williams\u2019 positive views emerge from his negative\nprogrammes of argument, we leave, for now, to the reader\u2019s\njudgement: we shall say something more to bring the threads together\nin section 5. Before that, we turn to Williams\u2019 critique of\nutilitarianism, the view that actions, rules, dispositions, motives,\nsocial structures, (\u2026etc.: different versions of utilitarianism\nfeature, or stress, some or all of these things) are to be chosen if\nand only if they maximally promote utility or well-being.\n4. \u201cThe day cannot be too far off\u2026\u201d: Williams against utilitarianism\n\n[T]he important issues that utilitarianism raises should be discussed\nin contexts more rewarding than that of utilitarianism itself\u2026\nthe day cannot be too far off in which we hear no more of it (UFA:\n 150).[18]\n\n\nWilliams opposes utilitarianism partly for the straightforward reason\nthat it is an\n \u201cism\u201d,[19]\n a systematisation\u2014often a deliberately brisk or indeed\n\u201csimple-minded\u201d one (UFA: 149)\u2014of our ethical\nthinking. As we have already seen, he believes that ethical thinking\ncannot be systematised without intolerable distortions and losses,\nbecause to systematise is, inevitably, to streamline our ethical\nthinking in a reductionist style: \u201cTheory typically uses the\nassumption that we probably have too many ethical ideas, some of which\nmay well turn out to be mere prejudices. Our major problem now is\nactually that we have not too many but too few, and we need to cherish\nas many as we can\u201d (1985: 117). Again, as a normative system,\nutilitarianism is inevitably a systematisation of our responses, a way\nof telling us how we should feel or react. As such it faces\nthe same basic and (for Williams) unanswerable question as any other\nsuch systematisation, \u201cby what right does it legislate\nto the moral sentiments?\u201d (1981: x).\n\nOf course, Williams also opposes utilitarianism because of the\nparticular kind of systematisation that it is\u2014namely, a\nmanifestation of the morality system. Pretty well everything said in\nsections 2 and 3 against morality in general can be more tightly\nfocused to yield an objection to utilitarianism in particular, and\nsometimes this is all we will need to bear in mind to understand some\nspecific objection to utilitarianism that Williams offers. Thus, for\ninstance, utilitarianism in its classic form is bound to face the\nobjections that face any moral system that ultimately is committed to\ndenying the possibility of real moral conflict or dilemma, and the\nrationality of agent-regret. Given its insistence on generality, it\nfaces the \u201cone thought too many\u201d objection as well, at\nleast in any version that keeps criterion of rightness and decision\nprocedure in communication with each other.\n\nAbove all, utilitarianism is in trouble, according to Williams,\nbecause of the central theoretical place that it gives to the ninth\nthesis of the morality system\u2014the thesis that we put on one side\nearlier, about impersonality. Other forms of the morality system are\nimpersonal too, of course, notably Kantianism: \u201cif Kantianism\nabstracts in moral thought from the identity of\n persons,[20]\n utilitarianism strikingly abstracts from their separateness\u201d\n(1981: 3). Like Kantianism, but on a different theoretical basis,\nutilitarianism abstracts from the question of who acts well,\nwhich for utilitarianism means \u201cwho produces good\nconsequences?\u201d. It is concerned only that good consequences be\nproduced, but it does not offer a tightly-defined account of what it\nis for anything to be a consequence. Or rather it does offer an\naccount, but on this account the notion of a consequence is so loosely\ndefined as to be all-inclusive (1971: 93\u201394):\n\nConsequentialism is basically indifferent to whether a state of\naffairs consists in what I do, or is produced by what I do, where that\nnotion is itself wide\u2026 All that consequentialism is interested\nin is the idea of these doings being consequences of what I\ndo, and that is an idea broad enough to include [many sorts of]\nrelations.\n\n\nThis explains why consequentialism has the strong doctrine of negative\nresponsibility that leads it to what Williams regards as its\nfundamental absurdity. Because, for the utilitarian, it can\u2019t\nmatter in itself whether (say) a given death is a result of what I do\nin that I pull the trigger, or a result of what I do in that I refuse\nto lie to the gunman who is looking for the person who dies, doing and\nallowing must be morally on a par for the utilitarian, as also must\nintending and foreseeing. Williams himself is not particularly\nimpressed by those venerable\n distinctions;[21]\n but he does think that there is a real and crucial distinction that\nis closely related to them, and that it is a central objection to\nutilitarianism that it ignores this distinction. The distinction in\nquestion, which utilitarian ignores by being impersonal, is the\ndistinction between my agency and other people\u2019s. It is this\ndistinction, and its fundamental moral importance, that lies at the\nheart of Williams\u2019 famous (but often misunderstood)\n\u201cintegrity objection\u201d.\n\nIn a slogan, the integrity objection is this: agency is always\nsome particular person\u2019s agency; or to put it another\nway, there is no such thing as impartial agency, in the sense of\nimpartiality that utilitarianism requires. The objection is that\nutilitarianism neglects the fact that \u201cpractical deliberation\n[unlike epistemic deliberation] is in every case first-personal, and\nthe first person is not derivative or naturally replaced by [the\nimpersonal] anyone\u201d (1985: 68). Hence we are not\n\u201cagents of the universal satisfaction system\u201d, nor indeed\nprimarily \u201cjanitors of any system of values, even our own\u201d\n(UFA: 118). No agent can be expected to be what a utilitarian agent\nhas to be\u2014someone whose decisions \u201care a function of all\nthe satisfactions which he can affect from where he is\u201d (UFA:\n115); no agent can be required, as all are required by utilitarianism,\nto abandon his own particular life and projects for the\n\u201cimpartial point of view\u201d or \u201cthe point of view of\nmorality\u201d, and do all his decision-making, including (if it\nproves appropriate) a decision to give a lot of weight to his own life\nand projects, exclusively from there. As Williams famously puts it\n(UFA: 116\u2013117):\n\nThe point is that [the agent] is identified with his actions as\nflowing from projects or attitudes which\u2026 he takes seriously at\nthe deepest level, as what his life is about\u2026 It is absurd to\ndemand of such a man, when the sums come in from the utility network\nwhich the projects of others have in part determined, that he should\njust step aside from his own project and decision and acknowledge the\ndecision which utilitarian calculation requires. It is to alienate him\nin a real sense from his actions and the source of his action in his\nown convictions. It is to make him into a channel between the input of\neveryone\u2019s projects, including his own, and an output of\noptimific decision; but this is to neglect the extent to which\nhis projects and his decisions have to be seen as\nthe actions and decisions which flow from the projects and attitudes\nwith which he is most closely identified. It is thus, in the most\nliteral sense, an attack on his integrity.\n\n\nHere, Williams\u2019 commitment to the importance of subjective\nauthenticity is on full display. \u201cThe most literal sense\u201d\nof \u201cintegrity\u201d is, according to Chambers\u2019 Dictionary\n(1977 edition), \u201centireness, wholeness: the unimpaired state of\nanything\u201d; then \u201cuprightness, honesty, purity\u201d. For\nour purposes the latter three senses in this dictionary entry should\nbe ignored. It is the first three that are relevant to Williams\u2019\nargument; the word\u2019s historical origin in the Latin\nin-teger, meaning what is not touched, taken away from, or\ninterfered with, is also revealing.\n\nAn agent\u2019s integrity, in Williams\u2019 sense, is his ability\nto originate actions, to further his own initiatives, purposes or\nconcerns, and thus to be something more than a conduit for the\nfurtherance of others\u2019 initiatives, purposes or\nconcerns\u2014including, for example and in particular, those which\ngo with the impartial view. Moreover, integrity is an essential\ncomponent of character, since, for Williams, an agent\u2019s\ncharacter is identical to their set of deep projects and commitments.\nWilliams\u2019 point, then, is that unless any particular agents are\nallowed to initiate actions and to have \u201cground projects\u201d,\nthen either the agents under this prohibition will be subjects for\nmanipulation by other agents who are allowed to have ground\nprojects\u2014the situation of ideological oppression. Or else, if\nevery agent lies under this prohibition and all agents are made to\nalign themselves only with the ground projects of \u201cthe impartial\npoint of view\u201d, there will not be any agents. To put it\nanother way, all will be ideologically oppressed, but by the ideology\nitself rather than by another agent or group of agents who impose this\nideology. For all agents will then have lost their integrity, in the\nsense that no single agent will be an unimpaired and individual whole\nwith projects of his own that he might identify himself with; all\nagents will have to abandon all \u201cground projects\u201d except\nthe single project that utilitarianism gives them, that of maximising\nutility by whatever means looks most efficient, and to order all their\ndoings around no other initiatives except those that flow from this\nsingle project. What we previously thought of as individual agents\nwill be subsumed as parts of a single super-agent\u2014the\nutilitarian collective, if you like\u2014which will pursue the ends\nof impartial morality without any special regard for the persons who\ncompose it, and which is better understood as a single super-agent\nthan as a group of separate agents who cooperate; rather like a swarm\nof bees or a nest of ants.\n\nIt is important not to misunderstand this argument. One important\nmisunderstanding can arise fairly naturally from Williams\u2019 two\nfamous examples (UFA: 97\u201399) of \u201cJim\u201d, who is told\nby utilitarianism to murder one Amazon villager to prevent twenty\nbeing murdered, and \u201cGeorge\u201d, who is told by\nutilitarianism to take a job making weapons of mass destruction, since\nthe balance-sheet of utilities shows that if George refuses, George\nand his family will suffer poverty and someone else\u2014who will do\nmore harm than George\u2014will take the job anyway. It is easy to\nthink that these stories are simply another round in the familiar game\nof rebutting utilitarianism by counter-examples, and hence that\nWilliams\u2019 integrity objection boils down to the straightforward\ninference (1) utilitarianism tells Jim to do X and George to do Y, (2)\nbut X and Y are wrong (perhaps because they violate integrity?), so\n(3) utilitarianism is false. But this cannot be Williams\u2019\nargument, because in fact Williams denies (2). Not only does he not\nclaim that utilitarianism tells both Jim and George to do the wrong\nthings. He even suggests, albeit rather grudgingly, that\nutilitarianism tells Jim (at least) to do the right thing. (UFA: 117:\n\u201c\u2026if (as I suppose) the utilitarian is right in this\ncase\u2026\u201d) Counter-examples, then, are not the point:\n\u201cIf the stories of George and Jim have a resonance, it is not\nthe sound of a principle being dented by an intuition\u201d (WME\n211). The real point, he tells us, is not \u201cjust a question of\nthe rightness or obviousness of these answers\u201d; \u201cIt is\nalso a question of what sort of considerations come into finding the\nanswer\u201d (UFA: 99). \u201cOver all this, or round it, and\ncertainly at the end of it, there should have been heard \u2018what\ndo you think?\u2019, \u2018does it seem like that to you?\u2019,\n\u2018what if anything do you want to do with the notion of\nintegrity?\u2019\u201d (WME 211).\n\nAgain, despite Williams\u2019 interest in the moral category of\n\u201cthe unthinkable\u201d (UFA: 92\u201393; cp. MSH Essay 4), it\nis not Williams\u2019 claim that either Jim or George, if they are\n(in the familiar phrase) \u201cmen of integrity\u201d, are bound to\nfind it literally unthinkable to work in WMD or to shoot a villager,\nor will regard these actions as the sort of things that come under the\nban of some absolute prohibition that holds (in Anscombe\u2019s\nfamous phrase) whatever the consequences: \u201cthis is a\nmuch stronger position than any involved, as I have defined the\nissues, in the denial of consequentialism\u2026 It is perfectly\nconsistent, and it might be thought a mark of sense, to believe, while\nnot being a consequentialist, that there was no type of action which\nsatisfied [the conditions for counting as morally prohibited no matter\nwhat]\u201d (UFA:\n 90).[22]\n\nNor therefore, to pick up a third misunderstanding of the integrity\nobjection, is Williams offering an argument in praise of \u201cthe\nmoral virtue of integrity\u201d, where \u201cintegrity\u201d\nis\u2014in jejune forms of this misreading\u2014the virtue of doing\nthe right thing not the wrong thing, or\u2014in more sophisticated\nforms\u2014a kind of honesty about what one\u2019s values really are\nand a firm refusal to compromise those values by hypocrisy or\ncowardice (usually, with the implication that one has hold of the\nright values). An agent can be told by utilitarianism to do something\nterrible in order to avoid something even worse, as Jim and George\nare. Williams is not opposing this sort of utilitarian\nconclusion by arguing that the value of \u201cintegrity\u201d in the\nsense of the word that he anyway does not have in mind\u2014the\npersonal quality\u2014is something else that has to be put into the\nutilitarian balance-sheet, and that when you put it in, the\nutilitarian verdict comes out differently. Nor is Williams saying,\neven, that the value of integrity in the sense of the word that he\ndoes have in mind\u2014roughly, allowing agents to be\nagents\u2014is something else that has to be put into the utilitarian\nbalance-sheet, as it is characteristically put in by indirect\nutilitarians such as Peter Railton and Amartya Sen: \u201cThe point\nhere is not, as utilitarians may hasten to say, that if the project or\nattitude is that central to his life, then to abandon it will be very\ndisagreeable to him and great loss of utility will be involved. I have\nalready argued in section 4 that it is not like that; on the contrary,\nonce he is prepared to look at it like that, the argument in any\nserious case is over anyway\u201d (UFA: 116). Williams\u2019 point\nis rather that the whole business of compiling balance-sheets of the\nutilitarian sort is incompatible with the phenomenon of agency as we\nknow it: \u201cthe reason why utilitarianism cannot understand\nintegrity is that it cannot coherently describe the relations between\na man\u2019s projects and his actions\u201d (UFA: 100). As soon as\nwe take up the viewpoint which aims at nothing but the overall\nmaximisation of utility, and which sees agents as no more than nodes\nin the causal network that is to be manipulated to produce this\nconsequence, we have lost sight of the very idea of agency.\n\nAnd why should it matter if we lose sight of that? To say it again,\nthe point of the integrity objection is not that the world will be a\nbetter place if we don\u2019t lose sight of the very idea of agency\n(though Williams thinks this as\n well[23]).\n The point is rather that a world-view that has lost sight of the real\nnature of agency, as the utilitarian world-view has, simply does\nnot make sense: as Williams puts it in the quotation above, it is\n\u201cabsurd\u201d.\n\nWhy is it absurd? Because the view involves deserting one\u2019s\nposition in the universe for \u201cwhat Sidgwick, in a memorably\nabsurd phrase, called \u2018the point of view of the\nuniverse\u2019\u201d (1981:\n xi).[24]\n That this is what utilitarianism\u2019s impartial view ultimately\nrequires is argued by Williams in his discussion of Sidgwick at MSH\n169\u2013170:\n\nThe model is that I, as theorist, can occupy, if only temporarily and\nimperfectly, the point of view of the universe, and see everything\nfrom the outside, including myself and whatever moral or other\ndispositions, affections or projects, I may have; and from that\noutside view, I can assign to them a value. The difficulty is\u2026\nthat the moral dispositions\u2026 cannot simply be regarded, least\nof all by their possessor, just as devices for generating actions or\nstates of affairs. Such dispositions and commitments will\ncharacteristically be what gives one\u2019s life some meaning, and\ngives one some reason for living it\u2026 there is simply no\nconceivable exercise that consists in stepping completely outside\nmyself and from that point of view evaluating in toto the\ndispositions, projects, and affections that constitute the substance\nof my own life\u2026 It cannot be a reasonable aim that I or any\nother particular person should take as the ideal view of the\nworld\u2026 a view from no point of view at all.\n\n\nAs Williams also put it, \u201cPhilosophers\u2026 repeatedly urge\none to view the world sub specie aeternitatis; but for most\nhuman purposes\u201d\u2014science is the biggest exception, in\nWilliams\u2019 view\u2014\u201cthat is not a very good\nspecies to view it under\u201d (UFA: 118). The utilitarian\ninjunction to see things from the impartial standpoint is, if it means\nanything, an injunction to adopt the \u201cabsolute conception\u201d\nof the world (1978: 65\u201367). But even if such a conception were\navailable\u2014and Williams argues repeatedly that it is not\navailable for ethics, even if it is for science (1985\nCh.8)\u2014there is no reason to think that the absolute conception\ncould provide me with the best of all possible viewpoints for ethical\nthinking. There isn\u2019t even reason to think that it can provide\nme with a better viewpoint than the viewpoint of my own life. That\nlatter viewpoint does after all have the pre-eminent advantage of\nbeing mine, and the one that I already occupy anyway (indeed cannot\nbut occupy). \u201cMy life, my action, is quite irreducibly mine, and\nto require that it is at best a derivative conclusion that it\nshould be lived from the perspective that happens to be mine is an\nextraordinary misunderstanding\u201d (MSH 170).\n\n(Notice that Williams is also making the point here that there is no\nsense in the indirect-utilitarian supposition that my living my life\nfrom my own perspective is something that can be given a philosophical\nvindication from the impartial perspective, and can then reasonably be\nregarded (by me or anyone else) as justified. Williams sees an\nincoherence at the very heart of the project of indirect\nutilitarianism, because he does not believe that the ambition to\njustify one\u2019s life \u201cfrom the outside\u201d in the\nutilitarian fashion can be coherently combined with the ambition to\nlive that life \u201cfrom the\n inside\u201d.[25]\n The kind of factors that make a life make sense are so different from\nthe kind of factors that utilitarianism is structurally obliged to\nprize that we have every reason to hope that people will not think in\nthe utilitarian way. In other words, it will be best even from the\nutilitarian point of view if no one is actually a utilitarian; which\nmeans that, at best, \u201cutilitarianism\u2019s fate is to usher\nitself from the scene\u201d (UFA: 134).) While some utilitarians have\nclaimed to be unfazed by this result\u2014it does not imply the\nfalsity of utilitarianism qua theory of right\naction\u2014the fact that they continue to publish books and articles\ndefending utilitarianism suggests that they do not really wish for the\ntheory to play no direct role in our moral deliberations.\n\nOn the issue of impartiality, it will no doubt be objected that\nWilliams overstates his case. It seems possible to engage in the kind\nof impartial thinking that is needed, not just by utilitarianism, but\nby any plausible morality, without going all the way to\nSidgwick\u2019s very peculiar notion of \u201cthe point of view of\nthe universe\u201d. When ordinary people ask, as they always have\nasked, the question \u201cHow would you like it?\u201d, or\nwhen Robert Burns utters his famous optative \u201cO wad some\npow\u2019r the giftie gie us/ To see oorselves as ithers see\n us\u201d,[26]\n it does not (to put it mildly) make best sense of what they are\nsaying to attribute to them a faithful commitment to the theoretical\nextravagances of a high-minded Victorian moralist. Can\u2019t\nmorality find a commonsense notion of impartiality that\ndoesn\u2019t involve the point of view of the universe?\nIndeed, if Williams\u2019 own views about impartiality are plausible,\nmustn\u2019t he himself use some such notion?\n\nTo this Williams will reply, we think, that a commonsense notion of\nimpartiality is indeed available\u2014to us, though not to moral\ntheory. The place of commonsense impartiality in our ordinary ethical\nthought is utterly different from the theoretical role of\nutilitarianism\u2019s notion of impartiality. The commonsense notion\nof impartiality is not, unlike the utilitarian notion, a lowest common\ntheoretical denominator for notions of rightness, by reference to\nwhich all other notions of rightness are to be understood. Rather,\ncommonsense impartiality is one ethical resource among\nothers. (Cp. the quotation above from 1985: 117 about avoiding\nsparseness and reduction in our ethical thinking, and\n\u201ccherishing as many ethical ideas as we can\u201d.) Moreover,\nand crucially, Williams\u2019 acceptance of \u201cmethodological\nintuitionism\u201d (see MSH essay 15) commits him to saying that the\nrelation of the commonsense notion of impartiality to other ethical\nresources or considerations is essentially indeterminate: \u201cIt\nmay be obvious that in general one sort of consideration is more\nimportant than another\u2026 but it is a matter of judgement whether\nin a particular case that priority is preserved: other factors alter\nthe balance, or it may be a very weak example of the kind of\nconsideration that generally wins\u2026 there is no reason to\nbelieve that there is one currency in terms of which all relations of\ncomparative importance can be represented\u201d (MSH 190). The\nindeterminacy of the relations between commonsense impartiality and\nother ethical considerations means that commonsense impartiality\nresists the kind of systematisation that moral theory demands. Hence,\nthere is indeed a notion of impartiality that makes sense, and there\nis indeed a notion of impartiality that is available to a moral theory\nsuch as utilitarianism; but the impartiality that is available to\nutilitarianism does not make sense, and the impartiality that makes\nsense is not available to utilitarianism.\n\nWilliams argues, then, that the utilitarian world-view is absurd\nbecause it requires agents to be impartial, not merely in the weak and\neveryday sense that they take impartiality to be one ethical\nconsideration among an unsystematic collection of other considerations\nthat they (rightly) recognise, but in the much stronger, reductive and\nsystematising, sense that they adopt the absolute impartiality of\nSidgwick\u2019s \u201cpoint of view of the universe\u201d.\n\nWe can also say something that sounds quite different, but which in\nthe end is at least a closely related point. We can say that Williams\ntakes the utilitarian world-view to be absurd, because it requires\nagents to act on external reasons. I turn to that way of putting the\npoint in section 5.\n5. Internal and external reasons\n\nIn his famous paper \u201cInternal and external reasons\u201d (1981:\n101\u2013113) Williams presents what I\u2019ll call \u201cthe\ninternal reasons thesis\u201d: the claim that all reasons are\ninternal, and that there are no external reasons.\n\nThe internal reasons thesis is a view about how to read sentences of\nthe form \u201cA has reason to \u03c6\u201d. We can read such\nsentences as implying that \u201cA has some motive which will be\nserved or furthered by his \u03c6ing\u201d (1981: 101), so that, if\nthere is no such motive, it will not be true that \u201cA has reason\nto \u03c6\u201d. This is the internal interpretation of such\nsentences. We can also read sentences of the form \u201cA has reason\nto \u03c6\u201d as not implying this, but as saying that A has reason\nto \u03c6 even if none of his motives will be served or furthered by\nhis \u03c6ing. This is the external interpretation of such\nsentences, on which, according to Williams, all such sentences are\nfalse.\n\nSince he is widely misinterpreted on this point, it is important to\nsee that Williams is only offering a necessary condition for\nthe truth of sentences of the form \u201cA has reason to\n\u03c6\u201d. He is not (officially) committed to the stronger claim,\nthat the presence of some motive which is served or furthered by\n\u03c6ing is sufficient for the possession of a reason to\n\u03c6. Officially, then, Williams is not defining or fully analyzing\nthe concept of a reason; rather, the necessary condition itself\nrepresents a threat. (We say \u201cofficially\u201d because there\nare indications that Williams unofficially held a stronger view; see\nthe final paragraphs in this piece for elaboration.)\n\nVery roughly, then, the basic idea of Williams\u2019 internal reasons\nthesis is that we cannot have genuine reasons to act that have no\nconnection whatever with anything that we care about. His positive\ndefense of the thesis can be roughly stated as follows: since it must\nbe possible for an agent to act for a reason, reasons must be\ncapable of explaining actions. This argument, it should be\nnoted, brings together a normative and a descriptive concept in a\nrobustly naturalistic manner. The notion of a reason, he argues, is\ninextricably bound up with the notion of explanation. Absent a motive\nwhich can be furthered by some action, it seems impossible for an\nagent to actually perform the action except under conditions of false\ninformation. If an external reason is one that is supposed to obtain\nin the absence of the relevant motive even under conditions of full\ninformation, then external reasons can never explain actions, and\nhence cannot be reasons at all (1981: 107).\n\nThis thesis presents a challenge to certain natural and traditional\nways of thinking about ethics. When we tell someone that he should not\nrob bank-vaults or murder bank-clerks, we usually understand ourselves\nto be telling him that he has reason not to rob bank-vaults\nor murder bank-clerks. If the internal reasons thesis is true, then\nthe bank-robber can prove that he has no such reason simply by showing\nthat he doesn\u2019t care about anything that is achieved by\nabstaining from bank-robbing. So we seem to reach the disturbing\nconclusion that morality\u2019s rules are like the rules of some\nsport or parlour-game\u2014they apply only to those who choose to\njoin in by obeying them.\n\nOne easy way out of this is to distinguish between moral\ndemands and moral reasons. If all reasons to act are\ninternal reasons, then it certainly seems that the bank-robber has no\nreason not to rob banks. It doesn\u2019t follow that the\nbank-robber is not subject to a moral demand not to rob\nbanks. If (as we naturally assume) there is no opting out of obeying\nthe rules of morality, then everyone will be subject to that moral\ndemand, including the bank-robber. In that case, however, this moral\ndemand will not be grounded on a reason that applies\nuniversally\u2014to everyone, and hence even to the bank-robber. At\nmost it will be grounded in the reasons that some of us have,\nto want there to be no bank-robbing, and in the thought that it would\nbe nice if people like the bank-robber were to give more general\nrecognition to the presence of that sort of reason in\nothers\u2014were, indeed, to add it to their own repertoire of\nreasons.\n\nIf we take this way out, then the moral demand not to rob banks will\nturn out to be grounded not on universally-applicable moral reasons,\nbut on something more like Humean empathy. Williams himself thinks\nthat this is, in general, a much better way to ground moral demands\nthan the appeal to reasons (\u201cHaving sympathetic concern for\nothers is a necessary condition of being in the world of\nmorality\u201d, 1972: 26; cp. 1981: 122, 1985 Ch.2). In this he\nstands outside the venerable tradition of rationalism in ethics, which\ninsists that if moral demands cannot be founded on moral\nreasons, then there is something fundamentally suspect about morality\nitself. It is this tradition that is threatened by the internal\nreasons thesis.\n\nOf course, we might wonder how significant the threat really is. As we\nparaphrased it, the internal reasons thesis says that \u201cwe cannot\nhave genuine reasons to act that have no connection whatever with\nanything that we care about\u201d. Let us take up this notion of\n\u201cconnections\u201d. As Williams stresses, the internal reasons\nthesis is not the view that, unless I actually have a given\nmotive M, I cannot have an internal reason corresponding to\n M.[27]\n The view is rather that I will have no internal reason unless either\n(a) I actually have a given motivation M in my\n\u201csubjective motivational set\u201d (\u201cmy S\u201d: 1981:\n102), or (b) I could come to have M by following \u201ca\nsound deliberative route\u201d (MSH 35) from the beliefs and\nmotivations that I do actually have\u2014that is, a way of reasoning\nthat builds conservatively on what I already believe and care about.\nSo, to cite Williams\u2019 own example (1981: 102), the internal\nreasons thesis is not falsified by the case of someone who is\nmotivated to drink gin and believes that this is gin, hence is\nmotivated to drink this\u2014where \u201cthis\u201d is in fact\npetrol. We are not obliged to say, absurdly, that this person has a\ngenuine internal reason to drink petrol, nor to say, in contradiction\nof the internal reasons thesis, that this person has a genuine\nexternal reason not to drink what is in front of him. Rather we should\nnote the fact that, even though he is not actually motivated not to\ndrink the petrol, he would be motivated not to drink it\nif he realised that it was petrol. He can get to the\nmotivation not to drink it by a sound deliberative route from where he\nalready is; hence, by (b), he has an internal reason not to drink the\npetrol.\n\nIt is this notion of \u201csound deliberative routes\u201d that\nprompts the question, how big a threat the internal reasons thesis\nreally is to ethical rationalism. Going back to the bank-robber, we\nmight point out how very unlikely it is to be true that he\ndoesn\u2019t care about anything that is achieved by not\nrobbing banks, or lost by robbing them. Doesn\u2019t the bank-robber\nwant, like anyone else, to be part of society? Doesn\u2019t he want,\nlike anyone else, the love and admiration of others? If he has either\nof these motivations, or any of a galaxy of other similar ones, then\nthere will very probably be a sound deliberative route from the\nmotivations that the bank-robber actually has, to the conclusion that\neven he should be motivated not to rob banks; hence, that even he has\ninternal reason not to rob banks. But then, of course, it seems likely\nthat we can extend and generalise this pattern of argument, and\nthereby show that just about anyone has the reasons that (a sensible)\nmorality says they have. For just about anyone will have internal\nreason to do all the things that morality says they should do,\nprovided only that they have any of the kind of social and extroverted\nmotivations that we located in the bank-robber, and used to ground his\ninternal reason not to rob banks. Hence, we might conclude, the\ninternal reasons thesis is no threat either to traditional ethical\nrationalism, nor indeed to traditional morality\u2014not at least\nonce this is shorn by critical reflection of various excrescences that\nreally are unreasonable.\n\nThis line of thought does echo a pattern of argument that is found in\nmany ethicists, from Plato\u2019s Republic to Philippa\nFoot\u2019s \u201cMoral Beliefs\u201d. However, it does not ward\noff the threat to ethical rationalism. The threat still lurks in the\n\u201cif\u201d. We have suggested that the bank-robber will have\ninternal reason not to rob banks, if he shares in certain\nnormal human social motivations. But what if he doesn\u2019t\nshare in these? The problem is not merely that, if he doesn\u2019t,\nthen we won\u2019t know what to say to him. The problem is that the\napplicability of moral reasons is still conditional on people\u2019s\nactual motivations, and local to those people who have the right\nmotivations. But it seems to be a central thought about moral reasons,\nas they have traditionally been understood, that they should be\nunconditionally and universally overriding: that it\nshould not be possible even in principle for any rational agent to\nstand outside their reach, or to elude them simply by saying\n\u201cSorry, but I just don\u2019t care about\nmorality\u201d. On the present line of thought, this possibility\nremains open; and so the internal reasons thesis remains a threat to\nethical rationalism.\n\nOne way of responding to this continuing threat is to find an argument\nfor saying that every agent has, at least fundamentally, the same\nmotivations: hence moral reasons, being built upon these motivations,\nare indeed unconditionally and universally overriding, as the ethical\nrationalist hoped to show. One way of doing this is the\nThomist-Aristotelian way, which grounds the universality of our\nmotivations in our shared nature as human beings, and in certain\nclaims which are taken to be essentially true about humans just as\n such.[28]\n Another is the Kantian way, which grounds the universality of our\nmotivations in our shared nature as agents, and in certain claims\nwhich are taken to be essentially true about agents just as such.\n\nIt is interesting to note that this sort of ethical-rationalist\nresponse to the internal reasons thesis can seem to undercut\nWilliams\u2019 distinction between external and internal reasons. For\nthe\n Thomist/neo-Aristotelian[29]\n or the Kantian, the point is not that we can truly say, with the\nexternal reasons theorist, that an agent has some reasons that bear no\nrelation at all to the motivations in his present S\n(subjective motivational set), or even to those motivations he might\ncome, by some sound deliberative route, to derive from his present\nS. The point is rather that there are some motivations which\nare derivable from any S\n whatever.[30]\n Williams himself recognises this point in the case of Kant (WME 220,\nnote 3): \u201cKant thought that a person would recognise the demands\nof morality if he or she deliberated correctly from his or her\nexisting S, whatever that S might be, but he thought\nthis because he took those demands to be implicit in a conception of\npractical reason which he could show to apply to any rational\ndeliberator as such. I think that it best preserves the point of\nthe internalism/ externalism distinction to see this as a limiting\ncase of\n internalism.\u201d[31]\n\nSo for the Kantian and the neo-Aristotelian or Thomist, there are\nmotivations which appear to ground internal reasons only, since the\nreasons that they ground are always genuinely related to whatever the\nagent actually cares about. On the other hand, these motivations also\nappear to ground reasons which have exactly the key features that the\nethical rationalist wanted to find in external reasons. Two in\nparticular: first, these reasons are unconditional, because\nthey depend on features of the human being (Aquinas) or the agent\n(Kant) which are essential features\u2014it is a necessary\ntruth that these features are present; and second, these reasons are\nuniversal, because they depend on ubiquitous\nfeatures\u2014features which are present in every human or\nagent. So Williams\u2019 response to the neo-Aristotelian or the\nKantian view of practical reason had better not be (and indeed is not)\nsimply to invoke his internal reasons thesis. As he realises, he also\nneeds to argue that there can\u2019t be reasons of the kinds that the\nneo-Aristotelian and the Kantian posit: reasons which are genuinely\nunconditional, but also genuinely related to each and every\nagent\u2019s actual motivations. Whatever else may be wrong with the\nneo-Aristotelian and Kantian theories of practical reason, it\nwon\u2019t be simply that they invoke external reasons; for it is\nfairly clear that they don\u2019t (the contemporary Kantian\nphilosopher who has most effectively pushed this point is Christine\nKorsgaard, see her Sources of Normativity, 1996).\n\nIf not even Kant counts as an external reasons theorist, who does?\nThat is a natural question at this point, since it is probably Kant\nwho is usually taken to be the main target of Williams\u2019 argument\nagainst external reasons. This assumption is perhaps based on the\nevidence of 1981: 106, where (despite the points we have already noted\nabout Kant\u2019s theory which Williams recognised at least by 1995)\nWilliams certainly attributes to Kant the view that there can be\n\u201can \u2018ought\u2019 which applies to an agent independently\nof what the agent happens to want\u201d. Even here, however, Williams\nis actually rather cagey about saying that Kant is an external reasons\ntheorist: he tells us that the question \u2018What is the status of\nexternal reasons claims?\u2019 is \u201cnot the same question as\nthat of the status of a supposed categorical imperative\u201d;\n\u201cor rather, it is not undoubtedly the same question\u201d,\nsince the relation between oughts and reasons is a difficult issue,\nand anyway there are certainly external reasons claims which are not\nmoral claims at all, such as Williams\u2019 own example of Owen\nWingrave\u2019s family\u2019s pressure on him to follow his father\nand grandfather into the army (1981: 106).\n\nIn any case, it is important to see that there do not have to be\nany examples of philosophers who clear-headedly and\ndefinitely espouse an external reasons theory. The point is rather\nthat no one could be a clear-headed and definite external reasons\ntheorist if Williams is right, because, in that case, the notion of\nexternal reasons is basically unintelligible (MSH 39:\n\u201cmysterious\u201d, \u201cquite obscure\u201d).\nWilliams\u2019 internal reasons thesis is that it is unintelligible\nto suppose that something could genuinely be a reason for me to act\nwhich yet had no relation either to anything I care about, nor to\nanything that I might, without brainwashing or other violence to my\ndeliberative capacities, come to care\n about.[32]\n If this thesis is true, then perhaps we should not expect to find any\ndefinite examples of clear-headed external reasons theorists. It will\nbe no surprise if someone who tries to develop a clear-headed external\nreasons theory turns out not to be definitely an external\nreasons theorist: thus for example John McDowell\u2019s theory in WME\nEssay 5, even though it is explicitly presented as an example of\nexternal reasons theory, is probably not best understood that way.\n(Very quickly, this is because McDowell wants to develop an external\nreasons theory as a view about moral perception, \u201cthe\nacquisition of a way of seeing things\u201d (WME 73). But\nliteral perception does not commit us to external reasons.\nWhen I literally \u201cjust see\u201d something, my visual\nperception\u2014even my well-habituated and skilful\nperception\u2014adds something to my stock of internal, not external,\nreasons. If we take the perceptual analogy seriously in ethics, it is\nhard to see why we can\u2019t say the same about moral perceptions.)\nNor, conversely, will it be surprising if someone who tries to develop\nwhat is definitely an external reasons theory turns out not to be, so\nfar forth, very clear-headed. Thus Peter Singer\u2019s exhortations\nto us to take up the moral point of view (see e.g. Practical\nEthics\n 10\u201311[33])\n give us perhaps the most definite example available of an external\nreasons theory in contemporary moral philosophy\u2014but are also one\nof the least clearly-explained or justified parts of Singer\u2019s\nposition. The notion of an external reason is, basically, a confused\nnotion, and Williams\u2019 fundamental aim is to expose the\n confusion.[34]\n\nThe fact that there can be no clear and intelligible account of\nexternal reasons has important consequences, consequences which go to\nthe heart of the morality system discussed in sections 2 and 3, and\nwhich also relate back to the critique of utilitarianism that we saw\nWilliams develop in section 4. If there can be no external reasons,\nthen there is no possibility of saying that the same set of moral\nreasons is equally applicable to all agents. (Not at least unless some\nuniversalising system like Kantianism or neo-Aristotelianism can be\nvindicated without recourse to external reasons; Williams, as\nwe\u2019ve seen, rejects these systems on other grounds.) Deprived of\nthis possibility, we are thrown immediately into a\nhistoricised way of doing ethics\u2014a project with roots\nin both the Hegelian and Nietzschean traditions. No absolute\nconception of ethics will be available to us; hence, neither will the\nkind of impartiality that utilitarianism depends upon. Agents\u2019\nreasons, and what agents\u2019 reasons can become, will always be\nrelativised to their particular contexts and their particular lives;\nand that fact too will be another manifestation of \u201cmoral\nluck\u201d.\n\nFurthermore\u2014a consequence that Williams particularly\nemphasises\u2014without external reasons, or alternatively something\nlike Kantianism or neo-Aristotelianism, there will be no possibility\nof deploying the notion of blame in the way that the morality\nsystem wants to deploy it. \u201cBlame involves treating the person\nwho is blamed like someone who had a reason to do the right thing but\ndid not do it\u201d (MSH 42). But in cases where someone had no\ninternal reason to do (what we take to be) the right thing\nthat they did not do, it was not in fact true that they had\nany reason to do that thing; for internal reasons are the\nonly reasons. Typical cases of blaming people will, then, often have\nan unsettling feature closely related to one that we noted at the\nbeginning of this section. They will rest on the fiction that the\npeople blamed had really signed up for the standards whereby they are\nblamed. And so, once again, there will seem to be something optional\nabout adherence to the standards of morality: morality will seem to be\nescapable in just the sense that the morality system denies.\n\nWilliams\u2019 denial of the possibility of external\nreasons\u2014understood in light of his naturalism and his\nanti-systematic outlook\u2014thus underwrites and supports his views\non a whole range of other matters. And though the internal reasons\nthesis too is, in an important way, a negative thesis, it is arguably\nthe cornerstone of a more robust, positive conception of our practical\nlives. While he only defended the negative condition in print, there\nis evidence that Williams actually believed that the right kind of\nstrong desire is a sufficient condition for the possession of a\npractical reason. In Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy, he\nbriefly opined that \u201cdesiring to do something is of course a\nreason for doing it,\u201d (1985:19), and he developed a theory of\npractical necessity according to which our deep commitments\n(\u201cground projects\u201d) necessarily constrain and direct our\npractical rationality (MSH 17).\n\nSeen in this light, the internal reasons thesis is the seed out of\nwhich most of Williams\u2019 ethical ideas grow. At the outset of his\nwriting career, he took for his own \u201ca phrase of D.H.\nLawrence\u2019s in his splendid commentary on the complacent moral\nutterances of Benjamin Franklin: \u2018Find your deepest impulse, and\nfollow that\u2019\u201d (1972: 93). Thirty years later he added,\nwhen looking back over his career, \u201cIf there\u2019s one theme\nin all my work it\u2019s about authenticity and\nself-expression\u2026 It\u2019s the idea that some things are in\nsome real sense really you, or express what you and others\naren\u2019t\u2026. The whole thing has been about spelling out the\nnotion of inner\n necessity.\u201d[35]\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Books and Papers by Bernard Williams", "Secondary Literature"], "cat_ref_text": {"Books and Papers by Bernard Williams": ["</h3>\n<h4>Books</h4>\n<p>\nThese are referred to simply by year and page number (e.g.,\n\u201c1972: 2\u201d), except where Williams published more than one\nbook in the same year, in which case we have used the abbreviations\nindicated.</p>\n<ul>", "1972: <em>Morality: An Introduction to Ethics</em>, Cambridge:\nCambridge University Press.", "PS: <em>Problems of the Self</em>, Cambridge: Cambridge University\nPress, 1973.", "UFA: <em>Utilitarianism: For and Against</em>, with J.J.C.
