History of sortal from 1690\u20131959 \n\nMany philosophers (e.g., Wallace 1965) have claimed that the notion of\na sortal is the same notion as developed by Aristotle under the label\n\u201csecondary substance\u201d in several of his writings. However,\nthat concept is both complex and controversial (see Furth 1988 and the entry on Aristotle\u2019s metaphysics) and we will not pursue the connection.\n\nThe first use of the term \u201csortal\u201d is in Locke\u2019s\nEssay Concerning Human Understanding (1975 [1690]).\n\n\nBut it being evident, that things are ranked under Names into sorts or\nSpecies\u2026the Essence of each Genus,\nor Sort, comes to be nothing but that abstract Idea, which\nthe General, or Sortal (if I may have leave so to call it,\nfrom Sort, as I do General from Genus) Name\nstands for. And this we shall find to be that, which the word Essence\nimports, in its most familiar use. (Bk.III, Ch.III, 15)\n\n\nLocke goes on to distinguish between real essences, which are mostly\nhidden from us and determined by nature, and nominal essences, which\nwe (somewhat) arbitrarily construct, but doesn\u2019t say which he\nmeans to pick out by the expression \u201csortal\u201d It is ironic\nthat in discussion of the history of the term Locke and Aristotle are\ncited as the two historical sources, when a main point of\nLocke\u2019s Essay was to argue against Aristotelian\nessentialism (see the entry on Locke).\n\nRoughly contemporaneously with Locke\u2019s introduction of the term,\nSpinoza noted the importance of a sortal like term for counting though\nhe did not use the term \u201csortal\u201d or a Latin\nequivalent.\n\n\nHe who holds in his hand a penny and a dollar will not think of the\nnumber two, unless he can call both the penny and the dollar piece by\none and the same name, to wit, a piece of money or a coin. (Spinoza\n1674: 259)\n\n\nThe other pre-twentieth century author who is frequently cited as an\nantecedent of contemporary discussions is Frege. In Frege (1884) he\nmakes the point that in counting things, we need to know what kind of\nthing we are counting. For example, something can be counted as one\nthing, a deck of cards, or as fifty-two cards. Frege was perhaps the\nfirst to use the phrase (which is translated as) \u201ccriterion of\nidentity\u201d. There is disagreement about whether Frege intended\nhis remarks to apply to all kinds of identity, as Dummett (1973)\nargues, or only to numbers, as Lowe (1989) argues, but Dummett\u2019s\nis the more common interpretation.\n\nWright (1983) argues that one of Frege\u2019s most important\ncontributions was emphasizing that numbers are objects and that this\nis intimately connected to Frege\u2019s claim that \u201cnatural\nnumber\u201d is a sortal. Wright is aware of the difficulties in\ncharacterizing sortals, which we will explore below, but remarks that\n\u201c\u2026whether or not it is ultimately rigorously explicable,\nthe intuitive notion of a sortal concept is clear enough for our\nimmediate purpose\u201d (1983: 4). For further discussion see the entry on Frege.\n",
