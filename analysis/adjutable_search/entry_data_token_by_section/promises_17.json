The idea of the self\npromises is a commonplace, in the vernacular as well as in poetry and\nprose (see Migotti 2003). But how self promises might produce\nobligations is a difficult question to answer for many promissory\ntheories.\n\nTraditionally self promises (and their counterparts, pledges,\nresolutions and similar commitments) have been discounted as proper\npromises, but there have been a number of recent attempts to vindicate\nself promises in the literature, and provide some positive explanation\nfor their normative force.\n\nConnie Rosati, in her influential piece \u201cThe Importance of Self\nPromises\u201d (2011) argues that self promises are, rather than a\nperipheral phenomena, the paradigmatic instance of promising\u2014as\nthey are exercises of our authority over ourselves. This idea is not\nwithout antecedent\u2014R.S. Downie says something similar in his\n1985 \u201cThree Accounts of Promising\u201d, as Rosati\nacknowledges. But Rosati\u2019s account is more\ndeveloped\u2014appealing to Owens-style authority and Darwall\u2019s\nsecond-personal normative framework.\n\nJorah Dannenberg (2015), in a Neitszchean vein, argues that self\npromises are a way of solidifying our wills, protecting our valued\nchoices from deterioration in the face of time and trials. And Janis\nSchaab (2021) argues against what she calls the\n\u201cincoherence\u201d argument against the possibility of one\nreleasing oneself from a promise.\n\nA central issue in this sub-literature is this last\u2014the problem\nof promisee release. This problem goes all the way back to Hobbes, who\nsays of self promises:\n\n\nNor is it possible for any person to be bound to himselfe ; because he\nthat can bind, can release; and therefore he that is bound to himselfe\nonely, is not bound. (Leviathan part II, ch. 26)\n\n\nIn cases of self promise, since the promisor is also the promisee, and\nso can release herself, then we are faced with Hobbes\u2019\nchallenge. Many authors have grappled with this puzzle\u2014some,\nlike Liberman (2019) move to drop the promisee release condition, and\nclaim that some sorts of self promise, like vows, cannot be revoked.\nOthers, like Habib (2009) and Schaab (2021), look to accept promisee\nrelease and explain Hobbes\u2019 difficulty away.\n",
