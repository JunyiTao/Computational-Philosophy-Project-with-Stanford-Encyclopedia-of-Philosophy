Later work (see below) uses terms like biodiversity\n\u201coption value\u201d (a term used in other ways in economics)\nand \u201cmaintenance of options\u201d (a term that includes other\ncontributions from nature, not just those from\nvariety/biodiversity).\n\nBack in 1980, the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of\nNature) reflected on this earlier work, and offered some distinctions\nthat are still useful in philosophical discussions about biodiversity\ndefinitions and values. IUCN\u2019s (1980: section 3) arguments for\nthe conservation of diversity (referring to \u201cthe range of\ngenetic material found in the world\u2019s organisms\u201d) echoed\nearlier statements about variety and future options:\n\n\nwe may learn that many species that seem dispensable are capable of\nproviding important products, such as pharmaceuticals\u2026.\n\n\nImportantly, IUCN also echoed other early work, in adding a critical\nsecond part to that sentence: \u201c\u2026or are vital parts of\nlife-support systems on which we depend\u201d (IUCN 1980: section 3).\nIUCN provided terms for these two ways in which variety itself\nbenefits humanity:\n\n\npreservation of genetic diversity (their stand-in for the\nnot-yet-defined \u201cbiodiversity\u201d) is both a matter of\ninsurance and investment to keep open future options. (IUCN 1980:\nsection 3)\n\n\nIt is informative to trace this insurance and investment duality in\nthe pre-history of \u201cbiodiversity\u201d. Roush (1977) listed\nfour reasons for preserving \u201cnatural diversity\u201d. In\naddition to the relational values concerning \u201chuman\ndelight\u201d and ethics, his reasons included not only the idea that\n\u201cdiversity increases the possibility of future benefits\u201d\nbut also that diversity supports stability of the \u201clife support\nsystem\u201d.\n\nHoldren and Ehrlich (1974) argued that loss of a species or loss of\ngenetic diversity can mean loss of potential uses (medicines, foods\netc.), but also referred to the maintenance of the \u201cpublic\nservice\u201d functions of natural ecosystems. Ehrenfeld (1970)\nsimilarly distinguished between the within ecosystem\nfunctioning/stability argument and the potential uses or option value\nargument. Ehrlich and Ehrlich (1981), in their book\nExtinction discussed the insurance value of the Earth\u2019s\n\u201cbiological diversity\u201d through the analogy of popping\nrivets off an airplane wing\u2014we strive to keep all the rivets,\nbecause we do not know how many could be lost before the wing no\nlonger functions.\n\nThis pre-history of \u201cbiodiversity\u201d thus considered\nmultiple values for humanity from living variation itself, building on\nthe even-longer history of basic awareness that there lots of kinds of\nthings (e.g., species; for review, see Oksanen 2004). This\nargumentation also added to discussions that had considered\nattribution of \u201cintrinsic value\u201d to variety of life (see\nthe supplement on\n biodiversity preservation\n in the entry on environmental ethics, for discussion of intrinsic\nvalue.\n",
