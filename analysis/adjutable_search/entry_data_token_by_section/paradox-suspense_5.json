    "main_text": "Suspense and Surprise\n6. Suspense and Surprise\n\n\nSome explanation is in order for why Yanal and others think it \nunquestionable that uncertainty is required for suspense. Often \nsuspenseful fictions include many surprises, and one can feel \nsuspense if they think a surprise is up ahead. Picking up on this, \nmany discussions of suspense, such as Kendall Walton\u2019s, lump together\ntheir treatments of suspense and surprise (Walton, 1990: 259\u2013271). \nThe tendency to think of suspense as intimately related to surprise, \nfor which uncertainty appears to be required, may be one reason why \nmany people think suspense requires the same. But this assumption is \nmistaken in two ways. \n\n\nFirst, surprise does not require uncertainty, although it might first\nappear otherwise. If I think that something will happen and it does, \nthen I will not feel surprise. For example, if I think that my \nfriends have gathered at my apartment for my birthday, I will not \nfeel surprise when I come home and find them in my living room. Based\non failed surprise parties, one may conclude that surprise requires \nuncertainty. But this is too hasty. Surprise does not require that we\nbe in a cognitive state of uncertainty. And it is fairly easy to see \nwhy. I may be certain that my beer sits on the table in front of me, \nbut if it disappears when I reach for it, I will be surprised. Hence,\nI can feel surprise without uncertainty. To be mistaken is not the \nsame as to be uncertain. Surprise results from the sudden subversion \nof an expectation, not the resolution of cognitive uncertainty. \n\n\nSecond, although suspense and surprise are often found in the same \nfictions, and the prospect of a surprise can be the source of some \nsuspense, the connection stops there: Surprise is not involved in all\nor even most cases of suspense. Hence, whether suspense requires \nuncertainty is a matter independent of that concerning the conditions\nnecessary for surprise. \n",
