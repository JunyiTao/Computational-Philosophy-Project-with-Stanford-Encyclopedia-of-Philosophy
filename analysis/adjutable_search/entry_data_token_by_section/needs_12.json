    "main_text": "Distribution According to Need || Equalising Outcomes\n5.2 Equalising Outcomes\n\n\nThis suggests an alternative principle: distribute in whatever way\nleaves people at the end of the distribution with unsatisfied claims\nthat are as nearly equal in size as possible. In the example given,\nthat would mean aiming for an outcome in which each person falls 450\nkcal short of a fully adequate diet. But this too faces\nobjections. One is that it may look implausible in cases where some\npeople are very poor at converting resources into\nneed-satisfaction. Suppose, for example, we have to allocate medical\nresources between a number of people some of whom are very ill but\nwhose condition can be improved only slightly by the resources we\nhave. The equal outcome principle may entail devoting all of the\navailable resources to those people, and this may seem unfair to those\nwho otherwise could be helped much more. The principle in its\nunqualified form might also recommend levelling down\u2014i.e.,\nwithholding resources from people where supplying them would have the\neffect of increasing final inequality in need-satisfaction.\n",
