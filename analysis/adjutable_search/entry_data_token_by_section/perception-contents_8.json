    "main_text": "Varieties of Content || Fregean Content\n3.3 Fregean Contents\n\nA third theory says that the contents of experience are composed of\nmodes of presentation of objects and properties, rather than\nobjects and properties themselves. The key feature of modes of\npresentation, on this view, is that a single object or property can\nhave multiple modes of presentation. A Fregean content will be true\nonly if the object presented by a mode of presentation in the content\nhas the property (or properties) presented by a mode of presentation\nin the content. (See Chalmers 2004).\n\nThe Fregean theory is motivated in part by the same considerations\nthat motivate analogous views in the philosophy of language. The key\nsort of example in the philosophy of language involves a pair of\nsentences, such as \u201cHesperus is the morning star\u201d and\n\u201cHesperus is the evening star\u201d, that are the same except\nfor containing different terms that refer to or denote the same thing\n(both \u201cthe morning star\u201d and \u201cthe evening\nstar\u201d denote Venus). Suppose a subject rationally accepts one of\nthese sentences while rationally rejecting or remaining neutral on the\nother. Then, it is argued, though the sentences cannot differ in their\ntruth-value, they must play different roles in the subject\u2019s\nreasoning: for example, the subject will list Hesperus among the\nheavenly bodies visible in the evening, but she won\u2019t list\nHesperus among the heavenly bodies visible in the morning. Fregean\ntheorists take there to be an aspect of meaning that is linked to\ncognitive role in this way.\n\nFregean contents of experience are supposed to play the same role, and\nthus are motivated by cases with the same structure. Recall our\nexample of two people with experiences that represent the same red\ncube at the same location L, but from different perspectives\n(Schellenberg 2018). The Fregean addresses this sort of case by\nholding that the experiences contain different modes of presentation\nof the cube. An example of such a view is defended in Burge\n(1991).\n\nAnother example that motivates the view that experiences have Fregean\ncontents involves perceptual constancies. In the case of color\nconstancy, a table can look such a way that one would readily judge\nthat it is uniformly brown, even though one can discern variations in\nlightness and darkness. Sometimes the variations are brought into\nfocus by considering how many different shades of paint one would have\nto use to paint a realistic picture of the table. The central problem\nthese cases pose for the theory of experiential content is to say\nexactly what \u2018lightness and darkness\u2019 are lightness and\ndarkness of: since there is a good sense in which the table\nlooks brown, it is not variation in the table\u2019s color; but the\nvariations seems nonetheless to be closely related to color. Size\nconstancy illustrates the same problem: a departing train does not\nappear to shrink as it moves away from you; but there is something\nlike size (even if it is not the size of the train) that does appear\nto lessen, and the problem for the theory of content is say what this\nis. Accounting for the constancies is a problem for the theory of\nexperience content, because both the constant features and the varying\nones are reflected in phenomenology, so by the phenomenal adequacy\nconstraint, the contents should reflect them. The problem presented by\nthe constancies is to show how it is that the constant and varying\nfeatures don\u2019t conflict in such a way as to make the experience\nfalsidical (for having contradictory contents).\n\nOne attempt to account for the variation in these cases is to invoke\nFregean modes of presentation of the constant features. In\nthe case of color, such a Fregean proposal would say that experience\nrepresents the brownness of the table under modes of presentation that\nvary with the variations in lightness and darkness. The appeal of this\nstrategy is that it does not treat the constant property and varying\nones on a par: the constant feature is represented at the level of\nreference; the varying features at the level of sense. The table does\nnot look to be both brown and shiny white or grey; it looks to be\nbrown, by looking shinier or brighter in some parts than it does in\nothers.\n\nIt should be noted that the other historically influential attempts to\naccount for the constancies was the sense-datum theory, which (in the\ncase of the table) would posit a sense-datum that really is shiny and\nwhite, in addition to the brown table itself. The Fregean attempt\nclaims to acknowledge both constant and varying features, without\npositing such additional entities.\n\nThe main challenges for Fregean views (of utterance content, belief\ncontent, and experience content) is to make precise in each case what\nmodes of presentation are such that they can reflect these variations.\n(For criticisms of Fregean views about the contents of both beliefs\nand experiences, see Thau 2002, ch. 2. For defense of the Fregean view\ndrawing on epistemological considerations, see Silins 2011). \n\n",
