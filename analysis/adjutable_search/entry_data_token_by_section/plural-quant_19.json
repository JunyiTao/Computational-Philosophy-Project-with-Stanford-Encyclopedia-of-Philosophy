    "main_text": "Ontological Innocence? || The direct argument\n5.4 Semantic values and ontological commitments\n\nIn semantics it is widely assumed that each component of a complex\nexpression makes some definite contribution to the meaning of the\ncomplex expression. This contribution is known as the semantic\nvalue of the component expression. It is also assumed that the\nmeaning of the complex expression is functionally determined by the\nsemantic values of the component expressions and their syntactic mode\nof composition. This assumption is known as\ncompositionality.\n\nAccording to Frege, the semantic value of a sentence is just its\ntruth-value, and the semantic value of a proper name is its referent\n(that is, the object to which it refers). Once we have fixed the\nsemantic values assigned to sentences and proper names, it is easy to\ndetermine what kinds of semantic value to assign to expressions of\nother syntactic categories. For instance, the semantic value of a\nmonadic predicate will have to be a function from objects to\ntruth-values. Frege calls such functions concepts.\n\nAs an example, let\u2019s consider the simple subject-predicate\nsentence\n\n(24)\nSocrates is mortal.\n\n\nThe logical form of (24) is \\(\\mathbf{M}(\\mathbf{s})\\), where\n\\(\\mathbf{M}\\) is the predicate \u201cis mortal\u201d and\n\\(\\mathbf{s}\\) is the singular term \u201cSocrates\u201d.\nLet\u2019s write [\\(\\mathbf{E}\\)] for the semantic value of an\nexpression \\(\\mathbf{E}\\). In accordance with the previous paragraph,\nthe semantic values relevant to (24) are as follows:\n\n(25)\n\\([\\mathbf{s}] = \\textrm{Socrates}\\) \n\n\n(26)\n \\([\\mathbf{M}] =\\) the function \\(f\\) from objects to\ntruth-values such that \\(f(x)\\) is the true if \\(x\\) is mortal and\n\\(f(x)\\) is the false otherwise\n\n\nThe truth-value of\n (24)\n is thus determined as\n\n(27)\n [(24)] \\(= [\\mathbf{M}(\\mathbf{s})] = [\\mathbf{M}] ([\\mathbf{s}])\n= f(\\textrm{Socrates}) =\\) the true (if Socrates is mortal) or the\nfalse (otherwise).\n\n\nFrege took the connection between semantic values and ontological\ncommitments to be a very close one. For on the above analysis,\n (24)\n supports two kinds of existential generalizations: not just to\n\\(\\Exists{x}\\mstop\\mathbf{M}(x)\\) (which is true just in case there\nexists some object which is mortal) but also to \\(\\Exists{F}\\mstop\nF(s)\\) (which is true just in case there exists some concept under\nwhich Socrates falls). According to Frege, this shows that sentences\nsuch as\n (24)\n are ontologically committed not just to an object but also to a\nconcept.\n\nWhat matters for present purposes is not the truth or falsity of\nFrege\u2019s claim about concepts but whether a cogent argument of\nthis sort can be developed for plural expressions. To investigate\nthis, let\u2019s consider a simple non-distributive plural\npredication such as\n\n(28)\n These apples form a circle.\n\n\nThe logical form of (28) appears to be \\(\\mathbf{C}(\\mathbf{aa})\\),\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) is the predicate \u201cform a circle\u201d and\n\\(\\mathbf{aa}\\) is the plural term \u201cthese apples\u201d. (If you\nthink complex plural demonstrative have internal semantic structure,\nuse instead some plural name stipulated to refer directly to the\napples in question.) The natural view will then be as follows.\n\n(29)\n [\\(\\mathbf{aa}] = a_1\\) and \u2026 and \\(a_n\\) (where the\n\\(a_i\\) are all and only the apples demonstrated)\n\n\n(30)\n [\\(\\mathbf{C}] =\\) the function \\(g\\) from pluralities to\ntruth-values such that \\(g(xx)\\) is the true if \\(xx\\) form a circle\nand \\(g(xx)\\) is the false otherwise\n\n\nThe truth-value of\n (28)\n will then be determined as\n\n(31)\n [(28)] \\(= [\\mathbf{C}(\\mathbf{aa})] = [\\mathbf{C}]\n([\\mathbf{aa}]) = g(a_1\\) and \u2026 and \\(a_n\\)) = the true (if\n\\(a_1\\) and \u2026 and \\(a_n\\) form a circle) or the false\n(otherwise)\n\n\nwhich is what one would expect, given the syntactic similarity between\n (24)\n and (28).\n\nAssume that this analysis is correct and that each plural term thus\nhas some objects as its semantic value, just as each singular term has\none object as its semantic value. What will this mean for the question\nof Ontological Innocence? According to the Fregean tradition, which\nconnects the notion of ontological commitment to that of a semantic\nvalue, this will mean that plural expressions incur commitment to\nplural entities, much as predicates incur commitment to concepts. For\nto say that a sentence incurs a commitment to a plural entity is just\nto say that the truth of the sentence requires there to be some\nsemantic value of the sort appropriate to plural expressions. However,\nthis line of reasoning will be resisted by other philosophers, who\nbelieve that the notion of ontological commitment should be tied (at\nmost) to singular first-order variables.\n\nHow can this disagreement be adjudicated? On the one hand, it may\ncount in favor of the Fregean tradition that their view is highly\nsystematic. There may be something ad hoc about the idea that\nsome sorts of semantic value give rise to ontological commitments\nwhile other sorts don\u2019t. On the other hand, it may count in\nfavor of the alternative view that it does better justice to many\npeople\u2019s strongly felt intuition that plural locutions are\nontologically innocent.\n\nAnother possibility is that the whole controversy is ultimately just a\npseudo-disagreement (see especially Florio and Linnebo 2016, but also\nParsons 1990; Shapiro 1993; Linnebo 2003; Rayo 2007; and Linnebo and\nRayo 2012). If both parties agree that plural expressions have\nsemantic values, and if both agree that commitments to\nobjects are incurred only by singular first-order terms and\nvariables, then perhaps it does not matter whether other sorts of\nterms and variables should be regarded as introducing their own\ndistinctive kinds of ontological commitment. Some philosophers speak\nabout a theory\u2019s ideological commitments and not just\nabout its ontological commitments. By this is meant the logical and\nconceptual resources that the theory employs. Perhaps philosophers\nwould be well advised to focus more on the metaphysical and\nepistemological questions raised by a theory\u2019s ideological\ncommitments and worry less about whether these ideological commitments\nshould be also regarded as introducing a distinctive kind of\nontological commitment. After all, the notion of an ontological\ncommitment is a theoretical one, not one that has any sharp content\noutside of philosophy. So perhaps we should regard the notion more as\na means to the end of providing good philosophical explanations and\nless as a goal in itself.\n",
