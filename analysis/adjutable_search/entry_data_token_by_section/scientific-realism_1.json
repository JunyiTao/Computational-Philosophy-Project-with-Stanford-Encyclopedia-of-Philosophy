    "main_text": "What is Scientific Realism? || The Three Dimensions of Realist Commitment\n1.2 The Three Dimensions of Realist Commitment\n\nThe description of scientific realism as a positive epistemic attitude\ntoward theories, including parts putatively concerning the\nunobservable, is a kind of shorthand for more precise commitments\n(Kukla 1998: ch. 1; Niiniluoto 1999: ch. 1; Psillos 1999:\nIntroduction; Chakravartty 2007a: ch. 1). Traditionally, realism more\ngenerally is associated with any position that endorses belief in the\nreality of something. Thus, one might be a realist about one\u2019s\nperceptions of tables and chairs (sense datum realism), or about\ntables and chairs themselves (external world realism), or about\nmathematical entities such as numbers and sets (mathematical realism),\nand so on. Scientific realism is a realism about whatever is described\nby our best scientific theories\u2014from this point on,\n\u201crealism\u201d here denotes scientific realism. But what, more\nprecisely, is that? In order to be clear about what realism in the\ncontext of the sciences amounts to, and to differentiate it from some\nimportant antirealist alternatives, it is useful to understand it in\nterms of three dimensions: a metaphysical (or ontological) dimension;\na semantic dimension; and an epistemological dimension.\n\nMetaphysically, realism is committed to the mind-independent existence\nof the world investigated by the sciences. This idea is best clarified\nin contrast with positions that deny it. For instance, it is denied by\nany position that falls under the traditional heading of\n\u201cidealism\u201d, including some forms of phenomenology,\naccording to which there is no world external to and thus independent\nof the mind. This sort of idealism, however, though historically\nimportant, is rarely encountered in contemporary philosophy of\nscience. More common rejections of mind-independence stem from\nneo-Kantian views of the nature of scientific knowledge, which deny\nthat the world of our experience is mind-independent, even if (in some\ncases) these positions accept that the world in itself does not depend\non the existence of minds. The contention here is that the world\ninvestigated by the sciences\u2014as distinct from \u201cthe world\nin itself\u201d (assuming this to be a coherent distinction)\u2014is\nin some sense dependent on the ideas one brings to scientific\ninvestigation, which may include, for example, theoretical assumptions\nand perceptual training; this proposal is detailed further in\n section 4.\n It is important to note in this connection that human convention in\nscientific taxonomy is compatible with mind-independence. For example,\nthough Psillos (1999: xix) ties realism to a \u201cmind-independent\nnatural-kind structure\u201d of the world, Chakravartty (2007a: ch.\n6) argues that mind-independent properties are often conventionally\ngrouped into kinds (see also Boyd 1999; Humphreys 2004: 22\u201325, 35\u201336, and cf. the\n\u201cpromiscuous realism\u201d of Dupr\u00e9 1993).\n\nSemantically, realism is committed to a literal interpretation of\nscientific claims about the world. In common parlance, realists take\ntheoretical statements at \u201cface value\u201d. According to\nrealism, claims about scientific objects, events, processes,\nproperties, and relations (I will use the term \u201cscientific\nentity\u201d as a generic term for these sorts of things henceforth),\nwhether they be observable or unobservable, should be construed\nliterally as having truth values, whether true or false. This semantic\ncommitment contrasts primarily with those of certain\n\u201cinstrumentalist\u201d epistemologies of science, which\ninterpret descriptions of unobservables simply as instruments for the\nprediction of observable phenomena, or for systematizing observation\nreports. Traditionally, instrumentalism holds that claims about\nunobservable things have no literal meaning at all (though the term is\noften used more liberally in connection with some antirealist\npositions today). Some antirealists contend that claims involving\nunobservables should not be interpreted literally, but as elliptical\nfor corresponding claims about observables. These positions are\ndescribed in more detail in\n section 4.\n\nEpistemologically, realism is committed to the idea that theoretical\nclaims (interpreted literally as describing a mind-independent\nreality) constitute knowledge of the world. This contrasts with\nskeptical positions which, even if they grant the metaphysical and\nsemantic dimensions of realism, doubt that scientific investigation is\nepistemologically powerful enough to yield such knowledge, or, as in\nthe case of some antirealist positions, insist that it is only\npowerful enough to yield knowledge regarding observables. The\nepistemological dimension of realism, though shared by realists\ngenerally, is sometimes described more specifically in contrary ways.\nFor example, while many realists subscribe to the truth (or\napproximate truth) of theories understood in terms of some version of\nthe correspondence theory of truth (as suggested by Fine 1986a and\ncontested by Ellis 1988), some prefer a truthmaker account (Asay 2013)\nor a deflationary account of truth (Giere 1988: 82; Devitt 2005; Leeds\n2007). Though most realists marry their position to the successful\nreference of theoretical terms, including those for unobservable\nentities (Boyd 1983, and as described by Laudan 1981), some deny that\nthis is a requirement (Cruse & Papineau 2002; Papineau 2010).\nAmidst these differences, however, a general recipe for realism is\nwidely shared: our best scientific theories give true or approximately\ntrue descriptions of observable and unobservable aspects of a\nmind-independent world.\n",
