    "main_text": "Dialectical Argument and the Art of Dialectic || The Two Elements of the Art of Dialectic\n8.2 The Two Elements of the Art of Dialectic\n\nGiven the above picture of dialectical argument, the dialectical art\nwill consist of two elements. One will be a method for discovering\npremises from which a given conclusion follows, while the other will\nbe a method for determining which premises a given interlocutor will\nbe likely to concede. The first task is accomplished by developing a\nsystem for classifying premises according to their logical structure.\nWe might expect Aristotle to avail himself here of the syllogistic,\nbut in fact he develops quite another approach, one that seems less\nsystematic and rests on various \u201ccommon\u201d terms. The second\ntask is accomplished by developing lists of the premises which are\nacceptable to various types of interlocutor. Then, once one knows what\nsort of person one is dealing with, one can choose premises\naccordingly. Aristotle stresses that, as in all arts, the dialectician\nmust study, not what is acceptable to this or that specific person,\nbut what is acceptable to this or that type of person, just as the\ndoctor studies what is healthful for different types of person:\n\u201cart is of the universal\u201d.\n8.2.1 The \u201cLogical System\u201d of the Topics\n\nThe method presented in the Topics for classifying arguments\nrelies on the presence in the conclusion of certain\n\u201ccommon\u201d terms (koina) \u2014 common in the\nsense that they are not peculiar to any subject matter but may play a\nrole in arguments about anything whatever. We find enumerations of\narguments involving these terms in a similar order several times.\nTypically, they include:\n\nOpposites (antikeimena, antitheseis)\n\n\nContraries (enantia)\nContradictories (apophaseis)\nPossession and Privation (hexis kai ster\u00easis)\nRelatives (pros ti)\n \nCases (pt\u00f4seis)\n\u201cMore and Less and Likewise\u201d\n\n\nThe four types of opposites are the best represented.\nEach designates a type of term pair, i.e., a way two terms can be\nopposed to one another. Contraries are polar\nopposites or opposed extremes such as hot and cold, dry and wet, good\nand bad. A pair of contradictories consists of a term\nand its negation: good, not good. A possession (or\ncondition) and privation are illustrated by sight and\nblindness. Relatives are relative terms in the modern\nsense: a pair consists of a term and its correlative, e.g. large and\nsmall, parent and child.\n\nThe argumentative patterns Aristotle associated with\ncases generally involve inferring a sentence\ncontaining adverbial or declined forms from another sentence\ncontaining different forms of the same word stem: \u201cif what is\nuseful is good, then what is done usefully is done well and the useful\nperson is good\u201d. In Hellenistic grammatical usage,\npt\u00f4sis meant \u201ccase\u201d (e.g. nominative,\ndative, accusative); Aristotle\u2019s use here is obviously an early\nform of that.\n\nUnder the heading more and less and likewise,\nAristotle groups a somewhat motley assortment of argument patterns all\ninvolving, in some way or other, the terms \u201cmore\u201d,\n\u201cless\u201d, and \u201clikewise\u201d. Examples: \u201cIf\nwhatever is \\(A\\) is \\(B\\), then whatever is more (less) \\(A\\) is more\n(less) \\(B\\)\u201d; \u201cIf \\(A\\) is more likely \\(B\\) than \\(C\\)\nis, and \\(A\\) is not \\(B\\), then neither is \\(C\\)\u201d; \u201cIf\n\\(A\\) is more likely than \\(B\\) and \\(B\\) is the case, then \\(A\\) is\nthe case\u201d.\n8.2.2 The Topoi\n\nAt the heart of the Topics is a collection of what Aristotle\ncalls topoi, \u201cplaces\u201d or \u201clocations\u201d.\nUnfortunately, though it is clear that he intends most of the\nTopics (Books II\u2013VI) as a collection of these, he never\nexplicitly defines this term. Interpreters have consequently disagreed\nconsiderably about just what a topos is. Discussions may be\nfound in Brunschwig 1967, Slomkowski 1996, Primavesi 1997, and Smith\n1997.\n",
