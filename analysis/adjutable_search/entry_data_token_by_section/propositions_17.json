    "main_text": "The Metaphysics 101 Argument: Deep or Shallow? || Two Readings for Quantifiers\n6.3 Two Readings for Quantifiers\n\nSome philosophers have suggested that ordinary English quantifiers are\nsusceptible to multiple readings, or different readings in different\ncontexts of use. Thus, Hilary Putnam (1987, 2004) has argued that\nthere is no single meaning associated with the vocabulary of\nquantification, and that, depending on context, an assertion of\n\u2018there are \\(F\\)s\u2019 might be true or false. For example,\nthe Polish mereologist, in certain contexts, might be able to speak\ntruly in asserting \u2018any objects compose a further object\u2019,\nwhereas an assertion of the negation of this sentence might true in\ndifferent contexts. (Note that Putnam is clear that the phenomenon he\nis describing isn\u2019t mere quantifier-restriction.)\n\nThe acknowledgement of different meanings for the quantifiers is not\nenough by itself to explain away the intuitiveness of the Metaphysics\n101 argument. As we mentioned earlier, what is needed is an account of\nthe apparent oscillation between a shallow and a deep interpretation.\nThere could, in principle, be a plurality of interpretations of the\nquantifiers even if none of the readings differed with respect to\nmetaphysical depth.\n\nRecently, Thomas Hofweber (2005, 2016) has claimed to have found the\nrequired pair of readings. A quantifier, he claims, may have either a\ndomain-conditions or inferential role reading. The\ndomain-conditions reading is just the familiar reading we know from\nfirst order semantics: \u2018there are \\(F\\)s\u2019 is true iff\nthere exists an entity in the relevant real domain which satisfies\n\u2018\\(F\\)\u2019. This reading is therefore ontologically\ncommitting and so deep (and thus external). The inferential\nreading, by contrast, brings with it no ontological commitment, and so\nis shallow (and thus internal).\n\nHofweber explains that the inferential role reading serves an\nimportant function. It enables us the easy expression of partial\ninformation. For example, I might not recall a name or unique\ndescription of Fred\u2019s favorite detective, but if I want express\nthe partial information I have, I can do this by saying \u201cFred\nadmires some detective.\u201d. Now, on the domain-conditions reading,\nwhat I express is false, and so I have misinformed my audience. What\nwe need, to achieve the desired end, is a reading for \u2018there is\nan \\(F\\)\u2019 which validates existential generalization, regardless\nof whether the names occurring in the premise refer to an entity. This\nis what the inferential role reading provides. Thus, we say\n\u201cFred admires some detective\u2014yes, it\u2019s Sherlock\nHolmes!\u201d\n\nHofweber points out that these two readings are not like the two\nreadings for \u2018bank\u2019. They validate many of the same\ninferences (e.g., \u2018there is an \\(F \\amp G\\), therefore, there is\nan \\(F\\) and there is a \\(G\\)\u2019) and, within discourses lacking\nempty singular terms, they validate all of the same inferences.\n\nNow for the relevance to the Metaphysics 101 argument. On either\nreading of the relevant quantifiers in the Metaphysics 101 argument\n(those in steps 1, 2, and 4), the argument is valid. But on the\ndomain-conditions reading, premise 1 (at least) is, if not false, then\nat least dubious\u2014a piece of controversial ontology. On the\ninferential-role reading, all the problems go away, and the argument\nappears completely shallow. The Janus-faced character of the argument\ncomes from oscillating between the two readings. Moreover, given the\nclose relations between the two readings, it is understandable that\nthe metaphysician fails to realize her mistake in thinking that the\nargument establishes the existence of propositions.\n\nFor an account like Hofweber\u2019s to succeed, it must be possible\nfor attitude- and truth-ascriptions to be true even if\nthat-clauses do not designate. For if they designate, then\nthe domain-conditions reading of \u2018there is something \\(S\\)\nbelieves\u2019 would be true.\n",
