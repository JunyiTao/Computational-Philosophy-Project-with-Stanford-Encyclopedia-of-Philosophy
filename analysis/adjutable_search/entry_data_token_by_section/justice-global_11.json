Global Economic Injustice\n\nDo global economic arrangements \u2013 especially economic\nglobalization \u2013 give rise to important responsibilities?\nGlobalization is a complex phenomenon, characterized by the faster\nmovement of people, goods, and ideas across borders but with many\nfacets. For our purposes we need to note only some of its\ncharacteristic central features. These include (i) an increasingly\nglobally integrated economy, (ii) dominated by transnational\ncorporations engaged in activities (such as production and\ndistribution) that span multiple countries, (iii) increasing\nregulation of economic matters by supranational institutions (such as\nthe World Trade Organization), (iv) general commitment to removal of\nbarriers to \u201cfree trade,\u201d and (v) higher levels of\neconomic interdependence. While there is much debate about the\nlong-term effects of globalization and whether they are on balance\ngood or bad, at this stage, the effects of globalization have been\nmixed. For some, globalization has brought improvements, while it has\nworsened the position of others (Singer 2002; Hassoun 2008; Risse\n2012a; Risse and Wollner 2019).\n\nPhilosophers have been concerned with answers to a range of questions\nsuch as: What kinds of economic arrangements are just? Should our\ninternational institutions be reformed to better reflect fair terms of\nco-operation in our globalized world? Can globalization be better\nmanaged so that it works to assist the global poor more effectively?\nAre protectionist policies in trade justified or, rather, is free\ntrade required by considerations of justice? Should poor working\nconditions in developing countries be a matter of concern for citizens\nand consumers in affluent, developed countries? If so, how might\nharmful employment conditions be effectively improved?\n\nWhile Thomas Pogge argues that globalization has harmed the poor on a\nmassive scale, Mathias Risse argues that this is not at all clear\n(Pogge 2010; Risse 2005). Risse argues that in many ways the global\norder must be credited with benefiting the global poor as well. He\nchallenges Pogge\u2019s claim that there are feasible alternatives to\nour global order that could be easily implemented and would avert the\nharm to which Pogge draws attention.\n\nThe World Trade Organization (WTO) has been an important focal point\nfor discussion about global economic justice. In particular, critics\nargue that some of its policies, such as those that generally advocate\nfree trade but allow protectionism in affluent developed countries,\ninvolve grave hypocrisy and unfairness to some of the world\u2019s\nmost vulnerable people, while others defend some key WTO provisions\n(Risse and Wollner 2019; Pogge 2001; Moellendorf 2002; Hassoun 2009a,\n2011; James 2012). For further reading see: de Bres 2016. There are\nalso large disparities in the resources at the disposal of various\nparties such that weaker parties often suffer huge disadvantages in\nbeing able to negotiate agreements that work well for them. In these\nsorts of ways agents in developed countries (such as governments,\ncitizens or firms) can take unfair advantage of those in developing\ncountries (R. Miller 2010; Barry and Reddy 2008).\n\nMore generally, there are concerns related to the extraordinary power\nof multinationals and the undue influence they are able to exercise in\nnegotiating deals favorable to them at the expense of the interests of\nthe most vulnerable. So-called sweatshops (in which workers typically\nlabor under harsh and hazardous conditions) are also a frequently\nraised example of how western consumers are implicated in far away\nsuffering, given the high level of dependence in high-income countries\non labor from low-income ones. When we purchase products manufactured\nin sweatshops are we guilty of contributing to exploitation and if so,\nwhat ought we to do to mitigate these unfairnesses? Christian Barry\nand Sanjay Reddy offer an innovative proposal to incentivize\nimprovements in labor standards and wage levels in poor developing\ncountries (Barry and Reddy 2008). This \u201cJust Linkage\u201d\nproposal offers some additional desirable opportunities for enhanced\ninternational trade to those who meet higher standards.\n\nIn this domain, philosophers have also examined a range of other\nissues including obligations to forgive odious debt and whether\nmicro-finance is to be welcomed as a positive force for the global\npoor (Barry, Herman and Tomitova 2007; Khader 2014; Sorell and Cabrera\n2015; Hassoun 2019).\n\nSeveral philosophers have considered individuals\u2019 obligations to\npromote economic justice through ethical consumption. There is an\nimportant debate on whether ethical consumption is helpful and\nrequired (Risse 2005; Walton 2014). Some argue that ethical\nconsumption is only permissible when appropriately democratic (Hussain\n2012; Barry and MacDonald 2018). Others argue that ethical consumption\nis permissible as long as it promotes positive change (Hassoun 2018;\nBerkey 2021; Budolfson 2015).\n\nOther more general concerns about exploitation and economic justice\ncan be found at the entries on\n exploitation\n and\n normative economics and economic justice.\n See also the entry on\n globalization.\n",
