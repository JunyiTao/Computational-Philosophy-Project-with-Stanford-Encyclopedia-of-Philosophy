    "main_text": "Erotic Art vs Pornography: Beyond Aesthetics || Erotic Art, Feminist Theory, and Objectification\n4.2 Erotic Art, Feminist Theory, and Objectification\n\nIn a short but oft-quoted essay, Gloria Steinem describes what is for\nher \u201ca clear and present difference\u201d:\n\n\nLook at any photo or film of people making love, really making love.\n\u2026 there is usually sensuality and touch and warmth, an\nacceptance of bodies and nerve endings. \u2026 Now look at any\ndepiction of sex in which there is clear force, or an unequal power\nthat spells coercion. \u2026 The first is erotic: a mutually\npleasurable, sexual expression between people who have enough power to\nbe there by positive choice. \u2026 The second is pornographic: its\nmessage is violence, dominance, and conquest. (Steinem 1995: 31)\n\n\nThis idea that there is an important moral difference between\nerotic art and pornography, in so far as pornography focuses on sex\nthat is aggressive, emotionless, or alienated, while the focus of\nerotic art is on love, passion, and equality between partners, has\nbeen very influential (see, for example, Ellis 2006: 30; Mahon 2005:\n15; Ridington 1989: 27). However, delineating the distinctiveness of\nerotic art, as opposed to pornography, in terms of a particular\ncontent will not in and of itself establish that the latter is\nimmoral, while the former is not. As Theodore Gracyk (1987) has\nargued, the morally objectionable character of a representation can\nnever be just a matter of represented subject matter. For an artist\ncan decide to depict rape or other aggressive forms of abuse in an\nattempt to precisely warn and protest against such degradation of\nwomen or men (recall the work of Kiki Smith). That is why Helen\nLongino is careful to define pornography as\n\n\nverbal or pictorial material which represents or describes sexual\nbehavior that is degrading or abusive to one or more of the\nparticipants in such a way as to endorse the degradation.\n(1980: 43, our emphasis)\n\n\nLongino is only one of the many authors who have tried to capture what\nis morally problematic about pornography. But the intricacies of that\ndebate will not concern us here. Our focus is on erotic art, rather\nthan pornography. Still, it is worth considering some of the more\nbasic arguments, because they can be, and have been, put to use in\ndiscussions on the distinction between erotic art and pornography.\n\nPerhaps the most straightforward way to argue that pornography is\nmorally objectionable (in a way that erotic art is not) is to argue\nthat it is harmful. The harm that pornography does may occur in the\nproduction phase, and take the form of coercion, brutality, violence,\nor rape. But even if no harm takes place in the making of pornography,\nand models are treated fairly and with respect, there can still be\npost-production harms. Some have argued that the pornographic\nmaterials themselves constitute harm because, as a form of\nhate speech, they silence and subordinate women (MacKinnon 1987;\nLangton 1993, 2009; Maitra 2009). Others have emphasized that exposure\nto pornographic material may cause harm (Eaton 2007). The\nlatter claim is further refined by specifying the frequency of\nexposure (isolated/cumulative), the nature of the material\n(egalitarian/inegalitarian), the kind of harm inflicted\n(physical/psychological), and whom it is mainly inflicted on\n(consumer/third party). By systematically eroticizing aspects of\ngender inequality, inegalitarian pornography is mainly thought to\ncause harm to a third party, in particular women, through the\npernicious effect it has on its consumers (Eaton 2007).\n\n\u201cExploitation\u201d and \u201cobjectification\u201d are terms\nthat are used particularly often to describe what is wrong with\npornography. Martha Nussbaum (1995), for instance, has written a\nseminal essay on different forms of objectification and how they apply\nto pornography (see also Stock 2015). Artists like Nancy Spero have\ndefined pornography as \u201cstuff that exploits women\u2019s\nbodies\u201d (quoted in Cembalest 1989: 142). It might be thought,\nand indeed Spero and others have argued, that these ethical terms may\nserve to demarcate (erotic) art from pornography\u2014pornography\nbeing exploitative or objectifying in a way that (erotic) art is\nnot.\n\nThis way of drawing the line is significantly problematized by the\nemergence of feminist pornography. Examples are films like Skin.Like.Sun\n(2010, dir. Jennifer Lyon Bell and\nMurielle Scherre) and When We Are Together, We Can Be\nEverywhere (2015, dir. Marit \u00d6stberg), Molly\nKiely\u2019s graphic novel That Kind of\nGirl (1999), or Dirty Diaries,\na collection of Swedish movie shorts (2009). Mutual pleasure\nand consent are absolutely key in these pornographic works which seem\nto exhibit none of the moral flaws manifest in mainstream pornography\n(no exploitation, objectification, or eroticization of gender\ninequality). What is more, in rejecting sexual repression,\nself-oppression, and hypocrisy, these works are often said to have a\npositive, consciousness-raising force (Willis 1995; Taormino et al.\n2013; Maes 2017; 2020; Eaton 2017).\n\nBut even if one were to disregard this rapidly growing subgenre of\npornography, and argue that there is something deeply wrong with\nany type of pornography, that in itself would still not\njustify a strict divide between erotic art and pornography. For every\nplausible account of the relation between moral and artistic\nvalue\u2014whether it is autonomism, ethicism, immoralism, or\ncontextualism\u2014will acknowledge that works of art, including\nworks of erotic art, can be deeply morally flawed (Gaut 2007; see also\nEaton 2003 for an in depth analysis of Titian\u2019s\nRape of Europa, 1562). What\nis more, it appears that whatever (moral) objection one wants to bring\nforward against mainstream pornography, it is likely to apply to some\nerotic art as well (Patridge 2013). First, harm may be inflicted when\nerotic art is being produced (Brown 2002 tells the harrowing story of\nCellini and the Nymph of Fontainebleau). Second, some erotic art may\nalso constitute harm. At least, Langton and MacKinnon\u2019s\narguments seem to carry over seamlessly to (certain strands of) erotic\nart. One of the difficult questions for Langton and MacKinnon\u2014do\npornographers possess the appropriate authority to perform the speech\nacts of silencing and subordinating women?\u2014appears even easier\nto answer in the affirmative in the case of artists since their\nperceived authority is much less contentious. Third, some erotic art\nmay cause harm in the same way as pornography, that is, by eroticizing\naspects of gender inequality and thus shaping people\u2019s sexual\npreferences in such a way that sustains the current inequality between\ngenders (Eaton 2012). Finally, a detailed case is made by,\nrespectively, Cooke 2012 and Eaton 2012 that neither exploitation nor\nobjectification is unique to pornography and that both are present in\nmany works of erotic art\u2014a presence that is frequently\nunacknowledged precisely because critics tend to focus exclusively on\npornography and too often consider art to be above (moral)\ncriticism.\n\nTo conclude, it does not seem possible to make a clear-cut distinction\nbetween erotic art and pornography based on moral or feminist grounds.\nCritiques of pornography have focused on features that are shared by a\nmuch wider class of cultural products and by (some) works of erotic\nart in particular. This is not necessarily bad news for feminists. On\nthe contrary, feminists could embrace this conclusion as it implies\nthat their critiques are wider ranging than they at first appear to be\n(see Kania 2012; Mikkola (ed.) 2017; Mikkola 2019).\n",
