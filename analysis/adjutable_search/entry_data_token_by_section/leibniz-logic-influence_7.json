    "main_text": "The Discovery of Leibniz in Mathematical Logic\n6. Conclusions\n\n\nNo doubt, the new logic emerging in the second half of the 19th\ncentury was created in a Leibnizian spirit. The essentials of\nLeibniz\u2019s logical and metaphysical program and of his ideas\nconcerning a logical calculus were available at least since the 1840s.\nErdmann\u2019s edition of the philosophical works and\nTrendelenburg\u2019s presentation of Leibniz\u2019s semiotics were\nthe most important steps towards the further reception of Leibnizian\nideas among mathematical logicians at the end of the 19th century. As\nsoon as these logicians became aware of Leibniz\u2019s ideas, they\nrecognized Leibniz\u2019s congenial affinity and accepted his\npriority. But the logical systems had basically been already\nestablished. Therefore there was no initial influence of Leibniz on the\nemergence of modern logic in the second half of the 19th century.\n",
