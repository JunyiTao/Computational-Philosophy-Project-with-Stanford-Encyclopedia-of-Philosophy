    "main_text": "Negation and opposition in natural language || Matters of scope\n1.3 Matters of scope\n\nIf we think of negation as essentially a means for\nopposition\u2014the impossibility of simultaneously endorsing two\nincompatible options (see the entries on\n contradiction\n and the\n traditional square of opposition)\u2014propositional\n negation is not necessarily privileged. This view is formally\nimplemented in the Boolean algebraic model of Keenan and Faltz, on\nwhich negation is a cross-categorial operation, as are the binary\nconnectives:\n\n\nWe can directly interpret conjunctions, disjunctions, and negations in\nmost categories by taking them to be the appropriate meet, join, and\ncomplement functions of the interpretations of the expressions\nconjoined, disjoined, or negated. The sense in which we have only one\nand, or, and not is explicated on the\ngrounds that they are always interpreted as the meet, join, and\ncomplement functions in whatever set we are looking at. (Keenan and\nFaltz 1985, 6)\n\n\nTreatments of English and other languages frequently posit negative\noperators whose scope is narrower than the sentence or clause. This\ntradition dates back to Aristotle, for whom the predicate term\nnegation in Socrates is not-wise, affirming that the\npredicate not-wise holds of Socrates, yields a false\nstatement if Socrates does not exist, while the predicate denial\nSocrates isn\u2019t wise denies that the predicate\nwise holds of Socrates and is true if Socrates does not\nexist. For Jespersen (1917), the subclausal \u201cspecial\u201d\nnegation as in Nobody came, where \u201cthe negative\nnotion\u2026belong[s] logically to one definite idea\u201d, is\nopposed to \u201cnexal\u201d negation, applying to \u201cthe\ncombination of two ideas\u201d, typically the subject-predicate\nnexus. Later linguists usually follow Klima (1964) and Jackendoff\n(1969) in allowing for constituent negation (e.g., verb phrase\nnegation in You can [not go]) alongside sentential negation\n(You cannot go), utilizing various grammatical and semantic\ndiagnostics for distinguishing the two varieties.\n\nA syntactic correlate of the distinction between wide- (sentential)\nversus narrow-scope (constituent) negation in English is that only\nwhen the negative element has clausal scope, as in the (a) examples in\n(1)-(3) (or in this very sentence), can it trigger negative inversion\n(Klima 1964). In the corresponding (b) examples, the scope of negation\ndoes not extend beyond the fronted phrase, whence the exclusion of\never, a satellite of negation (negative polarity\n item).[4]\n\n(1)\n\n\na.\nWith no job will I be happy. [= I won\u2019t be\nhappy with any job]\nb.\nWith no job I will be happy. [= I will be happy without any\njob]\n \n(2)\n\n\na.\nIn no clothes does Robin look good.\nb.\nIn no clothes Robin looks good.\n \n(3)\n\n\na.\nAt no time were we (ever) alone together in the\nOval Office.\nb.\nIn no time we were (*ever) alone together in the Oval Office.\n \n\n\nNegation also interacts in complicated and often surprising ways with\nquantification and modality. Perhaps the most analyzed interaction is\nwith universal quantification. Despite the frequent condemnation of\nthe wide-scope reading of negation over universals as in the locus\nclassicus, All that glitters is not gold and similar\nexamples in French, German, and other languages, or in ambiguous\nsentences like All the boys didn\u2019t leave, the\navailability of such readings (depending on the speaker, the\nintonation contour, and the context of utterance) is not as illogical\nas it may appear (Horn 1989, \u00a73.4; Tottie and Neukom-Hermann\n2010).\n",
