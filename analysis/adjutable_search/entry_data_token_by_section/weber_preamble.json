    "main_text": "\n\nArguably the foremost social theorist of the twentieth century, Max\nWeber is known as a principal architect of modern social science along\nwith Karl Marx and Emil Durkheim. Weber\u2019s wide-ranging\ncontributions gave critical impetus to the birth of new academic\ndisciplines such as sociology as well as to the significant\nreorientation in law, economics, political science, and religious\nstudies. His methodological writings were instrumental in establishing\nthe self-identity of modern social science as a distinct field of\ninquiry; he is still claimed as the source of inspiration by empirical\npositivists and their hermeneutic detractors alike. More\nsubstantively, Weber\u2019s two most celebrated contributions were\nthe \u201crationalization thesis,\u201d a grand meta-historical\nanalysis of the dominance of the west in modern times, and the\n\u201cProtestant Ethic thesis,\u201d a non-Marxist genealogy of\nmodern capitalism. Together, these two theses helped launch his\nreputation as one of the founding theorists of modernity. In addition,\nhis avid interest and participation in politics led to a unique strand\nof political realism comparable to that of Machiavelli and Hobbes. As\nsuch, Max Weber\u2019s influence was far-reaching across the vast\narray of disciplinary, methodological, ideological and philosophical\nreflections that are still our own and increasingly more so.\n",
