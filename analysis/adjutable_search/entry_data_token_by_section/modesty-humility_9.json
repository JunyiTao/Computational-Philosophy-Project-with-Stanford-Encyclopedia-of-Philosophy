    "main_text": "Non-Doxastic Accounts || Proportion\n3.1 Proportion\n\n\nHurka (2001, 110\u2013111) sees modesty and humility as virtues of\nproportion. For him, attitudes should be proportionate to the absolute\ngoodness of their object. This involves a denial of an asymmetry that\nsome (Maes 2004) see as central to modesty; one\u2019s responses\nshould track absolute goodness regardless of whether the object is our\nown good qualities or those of another. Though he acknowledges that\nthis will involve some cognitive states, what must be proportionate for\nHurka are positive responses like pleasure or enjoyment. This account\nrequires accuracy in the sense that one\u2019s responses must be\naccurately proportioned to the goodness of the object, but not in the\nsense that it requires accurate beliefs about one\u2019s own good\nqualities.\n",
