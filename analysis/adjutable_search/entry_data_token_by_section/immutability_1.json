    "main_text": "Immutability vs. Impassibility\n2. Immutability vs. Impassibility\n\nDDI is sometimes conflated with the doctrine of divine\nimpassibility, which asserts that nothing external can affect\nGod \u2014 that nothing external can cause God to be in any state, and in\nparticular can cause him to feel negative emotions like grief.\nActually, DDI neither implies nor is implied by divine impassibility.\nSomething could be impassible but mutable if it could change itself,\nbut nothing else could change or affect it. God could be immutable but\npassible. For he could be changelessly aware of events outside himself\n-- perhaps even caused to be aware of them by the events themselves --\nand due to them changelessly feel such responsive emotions as grief.\nBut he would feel them without change, and so always feel them. If\ntemporal, such a God would grieve for us before, while and after we\nsuffer what he grieves for. There is nothing counter-intuitive in\nthis.  It's standard theism to hold that God has full foreknowledge of\nwhat is to befall us: he sees our pain before we feel it, not just\nwhile we feel it, and so grieves it beforehand if He ever grieves it\nat all.  There would be no difference in the quality of God's grief\nbefore and while the pain occurs. For were there anything about it He\ndid not know beforehand, the foreknowledge would not be full, and full\nknowledge beforehand should elicit the same reaction as full knowledge\nduring.  Likewise, it's standard theism to hold that God is\ncognitively perfect.  If he is so and exists in time, He has a past to\nrecall and so has perfect memory. If God perfectly remembers your\npain, it is as fresh for him years later as it was while it occurred,\nand if he perfectly loves you, perhaps he never gets over it. So we\ncan make sense of unchanging grief; if God does grieve, we might well\nexpect it from a God with full foreknowledge, cognitive perfection and\na perfect affective nature. If He is timeless, an immutable but\npassible God would just timelessly suffer for us \u2014 responsively,\ni.e., because of our pain. The case would be just as if God were\ntemporal, save that His knowledge would not be temporally located and\nso would not literally involve either foreknowledge or memory. So\nwhether God is temporal or timeless, DDI implies nothing odd here. And\nit need not \u201cdepersonalize\u201d God as some feel impassibility\nwould.\n\n\nStill, it is surprising that Western theists have held DDI. For\nWestern Scriptures seem to conflict with DDI. Some Scriptural texts\ndepict human sin as making God sadder than he was (e.g., Gen.  6:6),\nthen bringing God to new decisions, e.g., to flood the world.\nAccording to John, \u201cthe Word became flesh\u201d\n(1:14), i.e., God took on a human nature he did not always have. So\nWestern theism's Scriptural roots seem to deny DDI. Yet by the first\ncentury C.E., DDI was central to the main theory of God's nature,\n\u201cclassical theism.\u201d In such \u201cclassical theist\u201d\nwriters as Augustine and Aquinas, being immutable makes God\natemporally eternal (see e.g. Aquinas, ST Ia 9\u201310), and eternality is\nGod's distinctive mode of being. So DDI is at the roots of such\nwriters' understandings of God's nature. And though Scotus and Ockham\nled a revolt against divine atemporality, they and their followers\nmaintained DDI, and it ruled the theological roost till the\n19th century. So one wonders: what made DDI so attractive\nfor so long?\n",
