How to Save the Forms: The Plan of the Deductions 134e\u2013137c\n\n\nAfter having articulated potentially devastating criticisms of the\ntheory of forms, one might expect Parmenides to conclude that the\ntheory is a lost cause and should be abandoned. But,\nsurprisingly, Parmenides does exactly the opposite. He claims,\nrather, that one who does not \u201callow that for each thing there is\na character that is always the same\u201d (a clear reference to\nOne-over-Many) will \u201cdestroy the power of dialectic\nentirely\u201d (135b8\u2013c2). Here Parmenides means one of two\nthings, depending on whether \u201cdialectic\u201d is taken in a\ntechnical sense (as meaning the process by which a philosopher is\nsupposed to acquire knowledge of the forms\u2014see Republic\n534b3\u2013c5) or in a non-technical sense (as meaning the ability to\nconverse or communicate).\n\n\nIn any event, Parmenides makes it clear that the power of dialectic\n(however this is understood) cannot be saved unless the forms\nthemselves are saved. As a means of saving the forms, Parmenides\nrecommends a process of training that focuses on forms and takes note\nof the fact that forms wander (in the sense of having contrary\nproperties, such as being like and unlike: 135e1\u20137). In\nparticular, Parmenides suggests that the training process take the\nfollowing shape. First, concerning some form, it must involve\nextracting consequences from the hypothesis that that form is; second,\nconcerning the very same form, it must involve extracting consequences\nfrom the hypothesis that that form is not (135e8\u2013136a2).\nParmenides goes on to say that it is also important to consider\ndifferent sorts of consequences: first, consequences for the form that\nis hypothesized to be (or to not be), and second, consequences for\nthings other than the form that is hypothesized to be (or not to\nbe). Parmenides also says that the training process should\ninvolve extracting consequences for the relevant form in relation to\nitself and in relation to the others, and consequences for things other\nthan the relevant form in relation to themselves and in relation to the\nrelevant form.\n As most commentators agree, the arguments that occupy the second\npart of the dialogue may be grouped into eight distinct stretches of\nreasoning or Deductions, with an additional Appendix to the first two\nDeductions: 155e4\u2013157b5. (Most Neoplatonists take there to be\nnine Deductions.  Rangos (2014), building on remarks in Grote (1865)\nand a seminar of Heidegger from 1930\u201331, argues that the Appendix is\nnot merely a ninth Deduction, but also plays a special role in the\noverall scheme of Deductions.) There is some controversy over the\nprinciples of division that Plato uses to generate the groupings.\nSome, notably Meinwald (1991; 2014), Peterson (1996; 2000; 2003), and\nSayre (1996), argue that the division into eight Deductions should be\nexplained by the three principles of division announced by Parmenides\nin his description of the method of training. On this (non-standard)\npicture, the Deductions should be understood as aiming at the\nfollowing conclusions (where \u2018con-F\u2019 refers to the\nproperty contrary to the property of being F):\n\n\n(D1)\nIf the G is, then the G is not F and\nnot con-F in relation to itself.\n\n(D2)\nIf the G is, then the G is F and\ncon-F in relation to the others.\n(D3)\nIf the G is, then the others are F and\ncon-F in relation to the G.\n(D4)\nIf the G is, then the others are not F and not\ncon-F in relation to themselves.\n(D5)If the G is not, then\nthe G is F and con-F in relation to the\nothers.\n(D6)If the G is not, then\nthe G is not F and not con-F in relation to\nitself.\n(D7)If the G is not, then the\nothers are F and con-F in relation to\nthe G.\n(D8)\nIf the G is not, then the others are not F and\nnot con-F in relation to themselves.\n\n\n\n\nOthers, including Miller (1986), Gill (1996; 2014), Allen (1997), and\nRickless (2007), do not agree with this way of representing the proper\nway of generating eight Deductions. In particular, these scholars take\nissue with the claim that the third principle of division concerns\nwhether the consequences for the relevant form (or for things other\nthan the form) are relative to itself or relative to\nthings other than it. As they see it, the third principle of\ndivision concerns whether the consequences for the relevant form (or\nfor things other than the form) are positive or\nnegative. According to this standard picture, the Deductions\nshould be understood as aiming at the following conclusions:\n\n\n(D1)\nIf the G is, then the G is not F and\nnot con-F (in relation to itself and in relation to the\nothers).\n(D2)\nIf the G is, then the G is F and\ncon-F (in relation to itself and in relation to the\nothers).\n(D3)\nIf the G is, then the others are F and\ncon-F (in relation to themselves and in relation to the\nG).\n(D4)\nIf the G is, then the others are not F and not\ncon-F (in relation to themselves and in relation to the\nG).\n(D5)\nIf the G is not, then the G is F and\ncon-F (in relation to itself and in relation to the\nothers).\n(D6)\nIf the G is not, then the G is not F\nand not con-F (in relation to itself and in relation to the\nothers).\n(D7)\nIf the G is not, then the others are F and\ncon-F (in relation to themselves and in relation to the\nG).\n(D8) If the\nG is not, then the others are not F and not\ncon-F (in relation to themselves and in relation to the\nG). \n\n\n\n(D7 represents something of an anomaly here, because many of the\nconclusions actually derived in that Deduction are of the form: If the\nG is not, then the others appear to be F\nand con-F. See section 6.8 below.) Parmenides then offers to\nengage in the training exercise himself, taking \u201cone\u201d as\nthe relevant instance of \u201cG\u201d, and considering a\nrange of properties as instances of \u201cF\u201d (being\nmany, being a whole, being limited, having shape, being in oneself,\nbeing in another, being in motion, being the same as oneself, being\nthe same as another, being like oneself, being like another, touching\noneself, touching another, being equal to oneself, being equal to\nanother, being (or coming to be) older than oneself, being (or coming\nto be) older than another, being in time, being, being named or spoken\nof, and being the object of an account, opinion, knowledge, or\nperception).\n\n\nOne of the primary motivations for adopting the non-standard picture\nis that the standard picture makes it difficult to understand the\nsecond part of the dialogue as anything other than incoherent.  The\nproblem is this. On the standard picture, D1 and D2 together appear to\nentail that if the one is, then the one is F and is\nnot F (and the one is con-F and is not\ncon-F), and hence that it is not the case that the one\nis. Similarly, D3 and D4 together appear to entail that if the one is,\nthen the others are F and not F (and the others are\ncon-F and not con-F), and hence again that it is not\nthe case that the one is. On the other hand, according to the same\npicture, D5 and D6 together appear to entail that if the one is not,\nthen the one is F and is not F (and the one is\ncon-F and is not con-F), and hence that it is not\nthe case that the one is not. And similarly, D7 and D8 appear to\nentail that if the one is not, then the others are (or at least appear\nto be) F and not F (and the others are, or at least\nappear to be, con-F and not con-F), and hence again\nthat it is not the case that the one is not. Putting all eight\nDeductions together, the overall result on the standard picture is a\nstraightforward contradiction. One advantage of the non-standard\ninterpretation, then, is that it avoids reading the Deductions as an\nextended argument for a necessary falsehood.\n\n\nHowever, there are also good textual reasons to think that the\nstandard picture is superior to the non-standard proposal. For\nexample, in D2, Parmenides argues that if the one is, then the one is\nboth different and the same in relation to itself (147b7\u20138),\nboth like and unlike in relation to itself (148d3\u20134), and both\nolder and younger in relation to itself (152e2\u20133). But according\nto the non-standard picture Parmenides should not be using D2 to argue\nfor consequences about the one in relation to itself; rather,\nParmenides should be using D2 to argue for consequences about the one\nin relation to the others. (In reply to this sort of\ncriticism, Meinwald (1991, 46\u201375; 2014) and Sayre (1996, 114)\nargue, though in different ways, that Plato uses the\nin-relation-to qualifications in a technical, rather than\nordinary, sense. For criticisms of Meinwald\u2019s influential proposal,\nsee Gill (1996, 56, fn. 90; 2014), Sayre (1996, 110\u2013113), and\nRickless (2007, 102\u2013106).)\n\n\nAnother way out of the problem posed by the seeming incoherence of the\nDeductions is to suppose that the subject of one Deduction is\nnumerically distinct from the subject of some of the other\nDeductions. Multisubjectist interpretations of this kind have\nbeen defended by the Neoplatonists (including Plotinus and Proclus),\nCornford (1939), Miller (1986), and Sayre (1996). One of the\nmajor problems facing multisubjectism is the fact that Parmenides is\nquite explicit about the fact that the subject form of each Deduction\nis identical to the subject form of each of the other Deductions.\n(For further criticisms of multisubjectism, see Meinwald (1991,\n24\u201326). For particular criticisms of the Neoplatonist version of\nmultisubjectism, see Allen (1997, 211\u2013215 and 218\u2013224).)\n\n\nThe standard view (if there is one) is that the Deductions have an\naporetic purpose: their aim is to perplex, to set problems that must\nbe solved, either by rejecting some of the premises that lead to the\nmaster contradiction or by finding fault with the relevant\nreasoning. Aporetic interpretations of this sort have been defended by\nSchofield (1977), Gill (1996; 2012) and Allen (1997), with additional\nsupport provided by Patterson (1999). On this kind of view, Plato does\nnot commit to any particular way of solving the problems: the second\npart of the dialogue is simply meant to serve as a challenge to the\nreader.\n\n\nYet another alternative is that detailed logical analysis of the\nDeductions reveals arguments sufficient to establish both that the one\nis and, importantly, that principles such as Purity-F and Uniqueness\nare false. As Rickless (2007, 136\u2013137 and 211) argues, Purity-F\nis a background premise of both D1 and D4. Taken together, then, D1\nand D2 are sufficient to establish that a contradiction follows from\nthe hypothesis that the one is, on the assumption that Purity-F is\ntrue. That is, D1 and D2 together entail that if the one is, then\nPurity-F is false. But D5 and D6 together entail that the one is. It\nthen follows directly that Purity-F must be false. (Gill (2014) argues\nthat the result of D1 and D8, taken together, is that the one must be\nacknowledged to be both one and many.  She also thinks that Plato\nmeans for his readers to recognize that the same acknowledgment is\nneeded to overcome the problematic results of D4.) Moreover, D2\ncontains an argument for the claim that if the one is, then there are\ninfinitely many forms of oneness.  Given that the one is (thanks to D5\nand D6), it follows directly that there must be more than one form\ncorresponding to the property of being one, and hence that Uniqueness\nis false. (Rickless (2007, 238\u2013239) also argues that the second\npart of the dialogue provides sufficient reason to reject No Causation\nby Contraries.)\n",
