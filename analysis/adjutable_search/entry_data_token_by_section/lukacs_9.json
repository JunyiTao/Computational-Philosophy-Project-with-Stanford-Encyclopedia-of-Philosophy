    "main_text": "The later Luk\u00e1cs: Praxis, Totality, and Freedom || The Critique of History and Class Consciousness\n4.1 The Critique of History and Class Consciousness\n\nBy many of those who were looking for a sophisticated Marxist\nphilosophy, History and Class Consciousness was judged to be\na supremely important book (as for example by Karl Korsch and Ernst\nBloch, see Bloch 1923). The party orthodoxy, was not quite so enamored\nwith Luk\u00e1cs, however. In Germany and Hungary, party\nintellectuals disapproved of the book because of its idealist\ntendencies, culminating in its condemnation by Grigory Zinoviev in his\nopening address to the June 1924 World Congress of the Third\nInternational (see Arato and Breines 1979: 180). Luk\u00e1cs\u2019s\nhastily composed study on Lenin (1924) ultimately resolved the tension\nbetween a Luxemburgian view of revolutionary politics as an expression\nof the spontaneity of the proletariat and a Leninist conception of the\nparty as a vanguard agent\u2014a tension that characterizes\nHistory and Class Consciousness (see Feenberg 1988)\u2014in\nfavor of the latter. This anticipated a theoretical development\ntowards a more traditional form of Marxism to which he subscribed for\nthe remainder of his life (see also the unpublished defense of\nHistory and Class Consciousness in 1925a and L\u00f6wy\n2011).\n\nWhile the condemnation of Luk\u00e1cs\u2019s work by party\nintellectuals and Luk\u00e1cs\u2019s reaction may have been motivated\nby political expediency, the conception of society and of political\npractice contained in History and Class Consciousness had\nreal shortcomings. Jay (1984: 106\u2013115) argues that the idea of\nthe proletariat as the \u201csubject-object\u201d of history seems\nto entail a Fichtean conception of the self-constitutive capacities of\nthe revolutionary agent, unlimited by historical circumstances, and,\ncorrespondingly, of a self-constitutive practice that is hostile to\nall objectivity, an objection that is echoed by many of his more\nrecent interpreters (e.g., Rose 2009: 30\u20131; for a criticism of\nthis interpretation, see L\u00f3pez 2019: 134).\n\nThat the reification essay is characterized by a problematic\ninsistence that it is the very objectivity of social relations that is\nto be rejected is bolstered by Luk\u00e1cs\u2019s own evaluation in the\n1967 preface to the new edition of History and\nClass-Consciousness. Here, Luk\u00e1cs claims (alongside a\nnumber of exercises in self-criticism, which appear both unjustified\nand externally motivated) that his earlier arguments involved a\nconfusion between objectification (Vergegenst\u00e4ndlichung),\nexternalization (Ent\u00e4u\u00dferung), and alienation\n(Entfremdung). Luk\u00e1cs argues that Hegel was\nessentially correct to view objectification (that is, the fact that\nthe objects of our labor and the institutions of society are\nindependent of our consciousness) not as a deficiency but as a\nnecessary stage in the development of self-consciousness. Extending\nthis argument, he claims that the fact that social relationships\nappear external is not problematic in itself. Rather, it is\nalienation (the causes of which Marx uncovered) that should\nbe the object of the critique of reification: \u201cOnly when the\nobjectified forms in society acquire functions that bring the essence\nof man into conflict with his existence [\u2026]. This duality was not\nacknowledged in History and Class Consciousness\u201d (1967,\nxxiv; see also Pitkin 1987; see L\u00f3pez 2019 for an argument that this\nself-critique was unjustified). \n\nThe distinction between objectification and alienation entails i) the\npossibility of a critique of reification that does not require a\ncomplete reappropriation of objective social forms by a collective\nsubject and ii) a conception of political praxis that\nacknowledges the mutual dialectical dependence of subject and object\n(an insight that, according to Feenberg 2014 and L\u00f3pez 2019, is\nalready present in History and Class Consciousness).\n",
