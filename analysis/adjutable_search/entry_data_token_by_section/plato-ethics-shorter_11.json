    "main_text": "Laches\n15. Laches\n\nA dialogue of definition, the Laches takes up the subject of\ncourage, broadly construed. Unique among ancient writings about\ncourage, the Laches takes courage far beyond the battlefield,\nseeking a definition for courage not only in war but also in\nseafaring, in illness, in poverty, and in politics (191d). The\nprincipal interlocutors are men of military experience, Laches and\nNicias. Nicias is known to us for his prominence in the Sicilian\nexpedition, which has been narrated in melancholy detail by Thucydides\n(Books 6 and 7). He was enormously brave in battle, but a coward in\npolitics, afraid to tell the Athenian people how dangerously situated\ntheir army was. His life in itself illustrates the importance,\nrecognized by Socrates, of cultivating courage in every arena of\naction or suffering\n\nThe dialogue begins with a specific query about military training for\nthe young. A teacher is in town, displaying a new technique for\nfighting in armor, and two elderly fathers (Lysimachus and Melesias)\nare trying to determine whether they should send their young sons to\nthis teacher. Lacking accomplishments, the fathers have no confidence\nin their ability to choose how their sons should be educated, and they\nhave asked the two generals, Laches and Nicias, to observe the display\nand advise them. Nicias advises them to accept advice from Socrates as\nwell, because Socrates has referred him to an excellent teacher of\nmusic (180d); Laches supports Socrates\u2019 reputation, citing his\nactions at the battle of Delium, a disastrous defeat for Athens in\nwhich, as we know from other sources, Socrates showed extraordinary\ncourage (181b). This example will cast a long shadow over the\nsubsequent discussion, for Socrates\u2019 courage in this case was\nshown not merely in defeat, but during a rout.\n\nSocrates makes a move that will become familiar in other dialogues.\nThe anxious fathers have consulted generals, and Socrates thinks the\nfathers are on the right track; they should consult an expert (185a),\nbut for some time Socrates leaves it unclear what subject the expert\nshould be expert about. The anxious fathers had not expressed concern\nabout ethics, but Socrates takes their question as ethical. He assumes\nthat the purpose of any form of military training is to instill\ncourage in the soul (185e, with 190d), and he infers they are seeking\nan expert in that. He then introduces this basic premise: an expert in\ninstilling X must know what X is (190a).\n\nIf there is an expert on military training, then, that expert will be\nable to say what courage is. Laches tries first, with an answer that\nis inconsistent with his praise for Socrates: Courage is staying at\nyour post and not running away (190e). Socrates had shown courage\nduring a retreat, the military maneuver that most calls for courage.\nLaches\u2019 proposal plainly fails by the generality requirement,\nand Socrates shows this with examples of courage that do not satisfy\nthe proposed definition (191a\u2013d).\n\nLaches\u2019 second try is that courage is a kind of endurance of the\nsoul (192c), But what kind of endurance, foolish or wise? Here Laches\nenters a tangle; he does not want to say that courage is ever foolish,\nbecause then courage would not be reliably kalon, as all\nthose present believe that it is, and the definition would fail the\nexclusion requirement. Nor does Laches want to say that courage is\nsophos (wise), since that would entail mastery of the matter\nat hand, and such mastery seems to render actions less courageous\n(192c\u2013193e). Unable to see a way out of this tangle, Laches\nagrees with Socrates that he does not have a good answer.\n\nLaches\u2019 tangle requires someone to specify the kind of wisdom\nthat courage requires, and Nicias is prepared to do that. Courage, he\nproposes, is knowledge of what should inspire terror or confidence in\nwar or any other circumstance (195a). Socrates then understands this\nto be knowledge of future goods and evils. This, as we shall see, is\nvery similar to the definition that Socrates will give to Protagoras\nin the Protagoras (360d). Even so, the proposal will go down\nto defeat. Knowledge of good and evil is not carved up by temporal\nwords such as \u201cfuture,\u201dand knowledge of good and evil\nplainly embraces far more than courage; indeed, it would be the whole\nof virtue (199e). But Nicias has been clear that courage is only a\npart of virtue (198a, from 190cd). So he too has failed to establish\nthat he knows what courage is.\n\nHow should readers take this outcome? Has Socrates refuted the\nposition he takes in the Protagoras to his own satisfaction?\nThe matter is debated by scholars. Perhaps we can apply here a tool\ngiven us in the Euthyphro, where a statement about reverence\n(that it is loved by all the gods) was taken to be true, but not to be\nthe definition of reverence. In a similar way, \u201cknowledge of\nfuture goods and evils\u201d could be true of courage without\nsatisfying the conditions of definition. In this case, that would be\nbecause (it seems) courage cannot be differentiated by definition from\nvirtue as a whole, just as reverence apparently could not be\ndifferentiated from justice. If so, then these virtues cannot be\ndefined independently, but must be recognized in practice as\nparticular aspects or applications of wisdom. Like the\nEuthyphro, then, the Laches could be read as\nsupporting the unity of virtue. But this reading is not obvious; taken\nby itself, the dialogue seems to end on ground that is hostile to the\nunity of virtue.\n",
