    "main_text": "Essence and Existence\n6. Essence and Existence\n\n\nAlready during Godfrey\u2019s student days in Arts and in Theology at\nParis there was considerable discussion concerning the exact\nrelationship between essence and existence in finite or created beings.\nClosely associated with the metaphysical thought of Aquinas was the\nview that in all finite beings there is a real, i.e., not merely a\nconceptual or mind-dependent distinction and composition of an essence\nprinciple and an act of existing (esse) or existence\nprinciple. Already in the 1270s Giles of Rome was developing his own\ntheory of real distinction between essence and existence, and was soon\nengaged in ongoing controversy with Henry of Ghent. At times Giles\nreferred to essence and existence as distinct \u201cthings\u201d (res)\nand, while he denied that either could exist in separation from the\nother or that existence is an essence, his terminology left its mark on\nthe theory and open to such misinterpretations; for it invited critics\nto view existence or the act of being as an entity rather than as a\nprinciple of an existing entity, as Aquinas had envisioned it. While\nHenry of Ghent rejected any real distinction between essence and\nexistence, he defended something more than a merely conceptual\ndistinction between them, namely a new and third type that would fall\nbetween the real distinction and the merely conceptual, an\n\u201cintentional\u201d distinction (Wippel, 1981, 40\u201345).\n\n\nGodfrey briefly refers to this issue in Quodlibet II, q. 2, while\nattempting to determine whether the essence of a creature is\nindifferent to existence and nonexistence. He comments that either\nessence is really identical with existence and differs from it (1) only\nconceptually or (2) intentionally, or else (3) existence is a distinct\nthing, i.e., the act of the essence and really distinct from it (PB\n2.60). In Quodlibet IV, q. 2, he was asked to determine whether to hold\nthat predicamental things are eternal by reason of their quiddity is\nalso to hold that the world is eternal. In preparing his response he\npresents in greater detail these three different views on the\nrelationship between essence and existence (esse). According\nto some they are really distinct from one another and enter into real\ncomposition with one another. But one is not separable from the other\nso as to be able to exist apart from it. Consequently, if a thing lacks\nor loses its existential being, it also lacks or loses its essential\nbeing. According to a second view they are really identical, but differ\nintentionally. Hence when a thing loses its existential being, its\nessence cannot be said to exist; but it does retain its true\npredicamental or essential being (esse essentiae). Finally, a\nthird position, which Godfrey himself embraces, maintains that they are\nreally identical and differ only conceptually. They do not enter into\ncomposition with one another. Therefore, to the extent that something\nenjoys essential being, to that same degree it enjoys actual existence.\nAnd, adds Godfrey, whatever is understood of one is also understood of\nthe other (PB 2.235).\n\n\nIn Quodlibet III, q. 1, dating from 1286, Godfrey considers the\nargumentation offered for each of these positions. First he presents\nthe theory that distinguishes really between essence and existence in\nlanguage that reflects the terminology of Giles of Rome. Thus he\nrefers to existence both as \u201csomething\u201d (aliquid)\nand as a \u201cthing\u201d (res) that is added to\nessence. He then presents a number of arguments in support of this\nview which seem to be taken from Giles, especially from his\nQuaestiones disputatae de esse et essentia, q. 11. One of\nthese is reminiscent of the first part of Aquinas\u2019s much discussed\nreasoning in De ente et essentia, c.  4, which begins from\nthe fact that one can understand what something is without knowing\nwhether it actually exists. However, Giles\u2019s presentation (and\nGodfrey\u2019s repetition) of the argument makes a stronger claim. One can\nunderstand what something is and also know that it does not exist. But\nbecause nothing can be understood with the opposite of itself, essence\nand existence must be really distinct.  After presenting a series of\narguments against this theory and refuting the arguments he had\ninitially offered in support of it, Godfrey resolutely rejects any\nreal distinction between essence and existence.  For him they are\nidentical, and differ only in the way they signify, just as the\nconcrete noun \u201ca being\u201d (ens), the abstract noun\n\u201cessence\u201d (essentia), and the verb \u201cto\nbe\u201d or \u201cto exist\u201d (esse) differ in their\nmode of signifying, but designate one and the same reality (PB 3.304\n[brief version]; Wippel, 1981, 45\u201366).\n\n\nIn presenting Henry\u2019s theory of intentional distinction Godfrey\ntraces this back in large measure to what he regards as an incorrect\ninterpretation of Avicenna\u2019s notion of nature or essence when it is\nconsidered simply in itself or \u201cabsolutely\u201d rather than as existing in\nthe mind or in an individual entity. As Godfrey explains in his later\nQuodlibet VIII, q. 3, according to Henry\u2019s position real being is\ndivided into essential being (esse essentiae) and existential\nbeing (esse existentiae). A thing possesses essential being\nfrom eternity insofar as it corresponds to its appropriate exemplar\nidea within the divine intellect. Because of this it is a true or real\nquiddity or essence from eternity and falls into its appropriate\npredicament even though it is not an actual existent. Existing entities\nreceive actual existence only in the course of time when the divine\nwill intervenes to cause this. Within an actually existing being,\ntherefore, its essence and existence are not really distinct. But Henry\ndenies that they are identical. They are \u201cintentionally\u201d distinct\n(Wippel, 1981, 67\u201379; Marrone, 2001, 39\u201352; Porro, 1996, 211\u201353).\nGodfrey rejects Henry\u2019s new and intermediary kind of distinction out of\nhand. A distinction must either be real or purely conceptual.\nAccordingly, in Quodlibet III, q. 1 he argues at length against Henry\u2019s\napplication of the intentional distinction to essence and existence\n(Wippel, 1981), 85\u201388.\n\n\nAs already noted, for Godfrey essence and existence are really\nidentical and only differ conceptually. Whatever is true of essence is\ntrue of existence, and vice versa. It is not necessary to posit two\nreally distinct or even two intentionally distinct principles to\naccount for the fact that one may be aware of something as a possible\nexistent when it does not actually exist. It is enough to distinguish\nbetween potential being and actual being. If something is in potency in\nterms of its essence, it is in potency in terms of its existence. And\nif it is actual in terms of its essence, it is actual in terms of its\nexistence.\n\n\nGodfrey proposes a different kind of act-potency \u201ccomposition\u201d in\norder to meet one argument in support of real distinction between\nessence and existence. If, as Aquinas, Giles, and Godfrey all hold, the\nangels of Christianity are purely spiritual and not composed of\n(spiritual) matter and form, then it seems that they must be composed\nof essence and existence. Otherwise they would be perfectly simple and\nequal to God. Godfrey responds that one and the same being, even if\npurely spiritual, may be regarded as actual insofar as it exists, but\nas potential insofar as it falls short of the actuality enjoyed by a\nhigher being and, above all, by the First Being, God. He quotes\nProposition 2 from Proclus\u2019s Elementatio theologica: \u201cWhat\nparticipates in the One is both One and not-One.\u201d As Godfrey reads\nthis, anything that is different from the One can fall short of it only\nby approaching (accessus) the not-one. Hence it is simply by\nreason of the fact that such a being recedes from the One that it is\nnot the One itself. In this way more perfect beings such as angels are\ndistinct from the One, or God, without being composed either of matter\nand form or of essence and existence. Nonetheless, actuality and\npotentiality are present in them because they possess a certain\nintermediary nature and hence are likened or \u201cassimilated\u201d to something\nhigher and more actual, and to something lower and more potential.\nTherefore they are \u201ccomposed\u201d of potency and act, not really, but\nconceptually. This composition is not merely imaginary. It applies to\nsuch entities by their being related to something higher and to\nsomething lower (Quodlibet III, qq. 1, 3; Quodlibet VII, q. 7; Wippel,\n1981, 90\u201397).\n\n\nGodfrey\u2019s library contains two likely sources for this theory, first a\nrudimentary version found in the abbreviated text of Siger of\nBrabant\u2019s Quaestiones in Metaphysicam included in Godfrey\u2019s\nStudent Notebook, and second, an anonymous set of questions contained\nin the manuscript Bibl. Nat. lat. 16.096. While Godfrey\nliterally borrows certain parts of his theory from the second text, he\ndoes not follow this anonymous Radical Aristotelian Arts Master when\nhe goes on to argue that separate entities do not depend upon God as\ntheir efficient cause, but only as their final cause (Wippel, 1984,\n231\u201344).\n",
