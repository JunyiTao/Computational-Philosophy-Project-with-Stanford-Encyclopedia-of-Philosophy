    "main_text": "Dissolving Descriptions || Rejecting the existence claim\n6.3 Rejecting the existence claim\n\nA number of authors have observed that the traditional Russellian\nanalysis of definite descriptions gets us into trouble when we embed\ndescriptions into certain environments like propositional attitudes,\nconditionals, and questions (see Heim (1991) Elbourne (2005, 2010,\n2013, forthcoming), Neale (2005), Rothschild (2007), Hawthorne and\nManley (2012) and Schoubye (2011, 2013)). To illustrate the problem,\nconsider the following:\n\n\n(48) John wants the ghost in the attic to stop making so much\nnoise.\n\n(49) John wants that there be exactly one ghost in the attic and that\nit stop making so much noise.\n\n\nOn the standard Russellian analysis, we get something like a claim\nthat John wants that there be a unique ghost in his attic and that it\nstop making so much noise. Let\u2019s set aside the uniqueness claim\nfor the moment and just focus on the existence claim; is it really the\ncase that John wants there to be a ghost in the attic at all? Notice\nthat it won\u2019t do to try and extract the existence claim from the\npropositional attitude environment, for then we get an actual\nexistence claim, which is definitely not what we want.\n\nAs Rothchild (2007) observes, a similar argument can be made for\ndescriptions embedded in questions (here assuming, as did Russell,\nthat possessives are to be analyzed as definite descriptions):\n\n\n(50) Is my child making too much noise?\n\n(51) Is it the case that I have exactly one child and that it is\nmaking too much noise?\n\n\nClearly, the question being put forth in (50) is not concerned with\nfinding out whether or not the questioner has a child. Responding by\nsaying \u2018yes you have a child\u2019 would not be a partial\nanswer to the question.\n\nThe phenomenon also seems to apply to modal adverbs. Consider the case\nwhere I do not know if my upstairs neighbors have a child, but I\nspeculate that they do and that it is making noise. It would be odd\nfor me to offer up an utterance of (52), even though (53) would be\nfine.\n\n\n(52) It is possible that the child of my upstairs neighbors is making\nnoise.\n\n(53) It is possible that there is exactly one child of my upstairs\nneighbors and it is making noise.\n I believe this can point can be made for other modals as\nwell.\n\n\n\n(54) It is necessary that my identical twin has my DNA.\n\n(55) It is necessary that there is exactly one identical twin of me\nand that it have my DNA.\n\n\nElbourne (forthcoming) believes that the problem can even be\nconstructed in cases that are extensional if we quantify into the\ndescription. Consider the following.\n\n\n(56) No boy sold the dog he bought.\n\n(57) No boy bought exactly one dog and sold it.\n\n\nThere are circumstances in which the Russellian gloss in (57) is true,\nbut (56) is not true. For example, the case in which no boys bought\nany dogs.\n\nSchoubye\u2019s (2011) solution to all these cases bears notice. He\nargues that the problem can be avoided if we distinguish between the\nsentence itself, the presupposition, and what is asserted. So, for\nexample, for a sentence like \u2018The F is\nG\u2019 we have the following:\n\n\n\n\nSentence:\nthe F is G \n\nPresupposition:\n\u2203x(Fx &\n\u2200y(Fy \u2192 x=y) &\nGx) \n\nAssertion:\nGx  \n\n\n\nSo, as in the Ludlow and Segal analysis, the uniqueness claim is not\npart of what is asserted. On Schoubye\u2019s proposal, uniqueness is\nnot implicated, but is presupposed. But notice also that in this case\nthe existence claim is also not part of what is asserted. What is\nasserted is simply an open sentence! In some cases, the open sentence\nwill be existentially closed, but in cases like \u2018John wants the\nghost in the attic to be quiet\u2019 there is no existential closure.\nOf course it is possible to ask what it means to assert an open\nsentence, but notice that again we are converging on a view in which\nthe determiners fall out, leaving behind a free variable.\n",
