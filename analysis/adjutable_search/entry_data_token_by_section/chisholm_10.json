Ethics II \u2014 Contrary to Duty Imperatives\n\nOne of Chisholm\u2019s most influential critical papers in ethics is\n\u201cContrary-to-Duty Imperatives and Deontic Logic\u201d. A number\nof philosophers had noted the analogy between statements of necessity\n(e.g., \u2018it\u2019s necessary that red things are\ncolored.\u2019) and statements of obligation (e.g., \u2018it\u2019s\nobligatory that promises are kept.\u2019) They also noted the\nstructural similarities between the alethic modalities of necessity,\npossibility, and impossibility and the deontic modalities of\nobligation, permission, and prohibition. It\u2019s natural to think\nthat alethic necessity can be understood as truth at all possible\nworlds. So, by analogy, some suggested systems of deontic logic in\nwhich obligation would be understood as truth at all morally perfect\nworlds. Statements of permission (and prohibition), would be taken to\nmean respectively truth at some (or no) morally perfect worlds. This\ngenerates a straightforward deontic logic.\n\nChisholm recognized, however, that any system based on those\nassumptions (and making use of the standard connectives) would be\nunable to express certain familiar and important facts. Among these is\nthe fact that in many cases our moral obligations depend essentially\nupon our moral failings. For example, a person might have a moral\nobligation to apologize for some misbehavior \u2014 yet obviously he\nwould not be apologizing in a morally perfect world, since in such a\nworld he would not have misbehaved in the first place. Presumably,\nthere are no apologies in a morally perfect world. If we let\n\u2018O(Smith apologizes)\u2019 express the idea that there\nis a moral obligation for Smith to apologize, then the imagined\nsemantics would apparently be unable to account for the possibility\nthat the statement could be true. Smith does not apologize for\nanything at any morally perfect world.\n\nChisholm sketched a situation in which a person, (we can call him\n\u2018Smith\u2019), had (a) an obligation to go to the aid of his\nneighbor, (we can call him \u2018Jones\u2019). Assuming that it\nwould be best to notify Jones beforehand, Chisholm imagined that (b)\nSmith also had a conditional obligation to notify Jones in advance if\nhe was going to come to his aid. On the other hand, (c) if he was\ngoing to fail to come to Jones\u2019s aid, then Smith\u2019s\nobligation would be to avoid telling him that he was coming to his\naid. Finally, Chisholm assumed that (d) Smith was going to fail to\ncome to Jones\u2019s aid.\n\nThere is nothing incoherent or even surprising about the situation\nChisholm described, yet there seemed to be no adequate way to express\nthese statements in any extant system of deontic logic. No matter how\nthe obligation operators, material and formal conditionals, temporal\nrestrictions, etc. were juggled, the formal-language sentences simply\ndid not preserve the logical features of the familiar ordinary\nlanguage sentences. Consider, for example, the following\nsentences:\n\n\n(a1) O(Smith goes to the aid of Jones)\n\n(b1) O(Smith goes to the aid of Jones \u2192 Smith tells\nJones he is coming)\n\n(c1) ~(Smith goes to the aid of Jones) \u2192 O(~Smith tells\nJones he is coming)\n\n(d1) ~(Smith goes to the aid of Jones).\n\n\nChisholm pointed out that in many extant systems of deontic logic,\nthere is a general principle (\u201cdeontic detachment\u201d) that\nwould validate the inference from (a1) and (b1) to:\n\n(e1) O(Smith tells Jones he is coming)\n\n\nWhile (c1) and (d1) entail:\n\n(f1) O(~Smith tells Jones he is coming)\n\n\nThe conjunction of (e1) and (f1) is a near contradiction, telling\nSmith that he both has an obligation to warn Jones, and also that he\nhas an obligation not to warn Jones. If we assume that if you have an\nobligation to do something, then you don\u2019t have an obligation to\navoid doing it, we can derive an outright contradiction. Other\npossible representations of the situation fail to preserve other\nlogical features of the original sentences.\n\nPerhaps Chisholm was thinking that this puzzle could be solved by\nappeal to a system of deontic logic based on the notion of\nrequirement. Maybe he thought that a good way to represent the\nsentences in question would be to say (a) that Smith had a\nnon-overridden requirement to go to the aid of Jones; but that (b)\nthat if Smith were going to go to the aid of Jones, then this fact\nwould require that Smith notify Jones in advance; and furthermore (c)\nthat if Smith were not going to go to the aid of Jones, then this fact\nwould require that Smith not notify Jones in advance. Finally, there\nis the stipulation (d) that Smith is not going to go to the aid of\nJones. This solution to Chisholm\u2019s puzzle would be of greatest\ninterest if it could be shown not only to provide a suitable\nsemantical interpretation for the four cited sentences, but also to\npave the way to a complete system of deontic logic adequate for the\nexpression of statements of conditional obligation.\n\nChisholm\u2019s paper had a profound impact. It provoked renewed\ninterest in the logic of obligation. Several philosophers began\nworking on new systems of deontic logic. Many of these new systems\nincorporated a new idea \u2014 conditional obligation. This was\nintended to provide a formal representation for the thought behind\nsuch statements as \u2018if you don\u2019t do what you ought to do,\nthen you ought to apologize\u2019.\n",
