    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\n\nAdolf Reinach was born into a prominent Jewish family in Mainz,\nGermany in 1883. He began his university studies in Munich in 1901,\nwhere he studied law, psychology and philosophy. In 1905 he completed\nhis doctorate under the direction of Theodor Lipps with a dissertation\nentitled, \u201cOn the Concept of Causality in the Criminal\nCode.\u201d During this time, Reinach joined a circle of philosophers\nwho had studied Husserl's recently published Logical\nInvestigations (1900\u201301), a circle which included Johannes\nDaubert, Alexander Pf\u00e4nder, Theodor Conrad, and Moritz Geiger. In\n1909 Reinach moved to G\u00f6ttingen, where he completed his\nHabilitation under Husserl's sponsorship.\n\n\nShortly after the declaration of war in 1914 Reinach enlisted in the\nGerman army. While some letters and philosophical sketches from the war\nyears have survived, Reinach never published another manuscript or\ndirected another seminar. He died in battle in Flanders in 1917,\nshortly after becoming baptized into the Protestant Church.\n\n\nThe historian of phenomenology Herbert Spiegelberg writes:\n\n\nIndependently of each other, the G\u00f6ttingen students of\nphenomenology like Wilhelm Schapp, Dietrich von Hildebrand, Alexander\nKoyr\u00e9 and Edith Stein, in their accounts of this period, refer\nto Reinach, not to Husserl, as their real teacher in phenomenology.\nHedwig Conrad-Martius even goes so far as to call him the\nphenomenologist par excellence \u2026 It was his death in\naction in 1917 rather than Husserl's going to Freiberg which cut\nshort not only his own promise but that of the G\u00f6ttingen\nphenomenological circle. (1984, pp. 191\u2013192)\n\n\nThe influence of Reinach did however continue to make itself felt\nabove all in Poland through the work of Roman Ingarden and to some\ndegree also of Karol Wojty\u0142a (Pope John Paul II).\n",
