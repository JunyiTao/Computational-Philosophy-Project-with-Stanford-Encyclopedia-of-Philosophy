    "main_text": "Proposed solutions to the nonidentity problem || Nonidentity problem rooted in mistakes in calculating the relevant probabilities\n3.5 Nonidentity problem rooted in mistakes in calculating the relevant probabilities\n\nThis proposal claims we can retain the person-based intuition, thus\nrecognizing that bringing a person into an existence that is worth\nhaving but unavoidably flawed does not make things worse for,\nor harm (in a morally relevant sense), that person and yet insist that\nthe acts under scrutiny in the class of cases that most seriously\nchallenge the person-based intuition do, after all, make things worse\nfor the people they bring into the flawed existence (Roberts 1998;\n2003; 2006; 2009; Roberts and Wasserman 2017).\n\nThe proposal thus retains intuitions (1) and (2) but argues that the\ncondition set forth in intuition (2) \u2013 that the existence is\nunavoidably flawed \u2013 has not been satisfied for that\nclass of nonidentity cases. And it retains intuition (3) for that same\nclass of cases while rejecting (3) for those cases in which the\nexistence truly is unavoidably flawed (and arguing that, for that\nclass of cases, the claim that the act under scrutiny is permissible\nis perfectly plausible). \n\nThe strategy here is limited to the class of nonidentity cases that\nreason from (a) had the act under scrutiny not been performed, the\nperson who exists and suffers as an effect of that act very\nprobably would never have existed at all and (b) that existence\nis worth having to the conclusion (c) that act does not make things\nworse for, or harm, that person. That class of cases includes\nKavka\u2019s slave child and pleasure pill cases, Parfit\u2019s\ndepletion and risky policy cases, Broome\u2019s climate change case\nand cases involving historical injustice. The proposal does not,\nhowever, suggest that there is still a further class of nonidentity\ncases that does challenge the person-based intuition. Rather,\nit considers that further class of cases \u2013 which includes cases\nin which the existence is worth having but unavoidably flawed\ndue to a genetic or chromosomal disorder \u2013 as less worrisome in\nthe sense that it is surely less clear to us that the acts under\nscrutiny are themselves wrong.\n\nThe broader argument, then is that, in any case in which it is clear\nto us that what is done is wrong we can, on closer inspection,\nidentify just how the people caused to exist have been made worse off.\nAnd, in any case in which we are forced to concede that the\nperson caused to exist has not been made worse off \u2013\nany case in which the existence is unavoidably flawed but still worth\nhaving \u2013 we should acknowledge that it is not really clear to us\nat all that what has been done is wrong. \n\nWhat, then, is the argument for the claim that such a significant\nmistake in reasoning has been made? The first step in unwinding that\nmistake is to clarify that when we say an act makes a person worse\noff, we are not trying to press the claim that the act\nmakes the person worse off than that person would have been\nhad that act not been performed. The simple, counterfactual,\n\u201cbut for,\u201d account of harm that kind of effort involves\nwas \u2013 rightly \u2013 rejected decades ago. An alternative\nposition is that an act makes a person worse off at a given world if\nthere is some alternate act agents could have performed instead at an\nalternate world that would have made things better for that person at\nthat alternate world. If, in other words, it is (physically and\nmetaphysically) possible for agents to make things better for a given\nperson \u2013 if such an alternate world is accessible\nrelative to the one world \u2013 then what the agents have done makes\nthings worse for, and, we can say, harms, that person. For\ndefense of a maximizing account of harm, see Roberts 2011, Roberts\n2009, 209\u2013217, and Roberts 2007. For critical discussion of the\nsimple counterfactual account and the alternative maximizing account\nof harm, see Carlson forthcoming. For a reconstruction and defense of\nthe simple counterfactual account, see Klocksiem 2012. \n\nThe second step is to note that in the class of nonidentity cases that\nmost seriously challenge the person-based intuition agents\ndid have some way of making things better for the person who\nhas been brought into a flawed existence. Thus, nothing in the laws of\nphysics or metaphysics or in the acts of other agents bars the agents\nin the slave child case from not entering into the slave\nchild contract and still following the identical timetable\nfor conception they in fact followed and bringing into existence as a\nnon-slave the very same child they in fact brought into existence as a\nslave. \n\nIt might be objected that, while such a better-for-the-child outcome\nis physically and metaphysically possible \u2013 that is,\naccessible \u2013 it is surely highly improbable.\nThe third step of the proposed solution addresses that objection. It\nacknowledges Kavka\u2019s point about the precariousness of any given\nperson\u2019s coming into existence: the probability that that\nidentical child will come into existence, given that the\nagents do anything other than perform the clearly wrong act they in\nfact perform, is very low. We might say: the probability that agents\nwill follow the identical timetable for conception \u2013\nthat the timing and manner of conception will be at least close enough\nto the original to result in the conception of the identical\nchild \u2013 is very low. But it notes that the probability\ncalculation must itself be made as of that moment just prior to\nchoice. (It is, after all, that calculation that is relevant to a\ncalculation of the act\u2019s expected value. If it is\nactual value we are interested in instead, we\u2019ve\nalready shown that some alternate act exists that has more\nactual value to offer the child than the act in fact\nperformed.) It then notes further that \u2013 again calculating\nprobability just prior to choice \u2013 the probability of the\nparticular child\u2019s coming into existence is also very low, even\ngiven that the agents do enter into the slave child contract.\n\n\nSuppose, that is, that it is Harry who is in fact brought\ninto existence as a slave, the couple having entered the slave child\ncontract and conceived and produced a child. The proposal here simply\nnotes that the probability, calculated just prior to choice, that\nHarry will exist, given that the couple enters into the slave child\ncontract, is also very low. We might say: prior to choice, the\nprobability that the couple will follow exactly the timetable they in\nfact end up following (or anything sufficiently like it) is just as\nminuscule whether the couple enters into the contract and conceives a\nchild or the couple doesn\u2019t enter into the contract and still\nconceives a child. The probabilities, either way, are very\nlow and, indeed, a wash. For an objection that concedes such an\naccount supports a claim that choice under scrutiny makes things worse\nfor the child but argues that the adverse effect is so minuscule that\nthe account nonetheless fails to support to the claim that the choice\nunder scrutiny is wrong, see Greene 2016. \n\nOne might object that in fact there is no probability Harry\nwould exist in the absence of the couple\u2019s entering the\ncontract, for without the contract the probability that couple would\ntogether have produced any child at all is 0. That may be right, but\nit doesn\u2019t bear on whether Harry has been made worse off. As\nnoted above, the simple, counterfactual, \u201cbut for,\u201d\naccount of when a person has been made worse off (or harmed) must be\nrejected. It isn\u2019t what agents would have done, but\nwhat they accessibly could have done, that determines whether\nwhat they have done makes a person worse off or harms that person. If\nI shoot you in the arm and would have shot you in the heart had I not\nshot you in the arm, I have still made you worse off. I have made you\nworse off \u2013 not worse off than you would have been had I not\nshot you in the arm, but rather off worse off than you would have been\nhad I just stood there quietly instead. It\u2019s the best I \naccessibly could have done that should be our baseline\nin Feinberg\u2019s sense \u2013 not what I would have done\n\u2013 for purposes of determining when a person has been made worse\noff (or, in a morally relevant sense, harmed) (Feinberg 1988).\n\nNor is it appropriate to determine whether a person has been made\nworse off by a given act by comparing the actual value\nproduced for that person by that act against the expected\nvalue produced for that person by any alternate act. The proposal here\ntakes no position on whether the expected or actual value approach is\ncorrect. But it does take into account that the view that an act can\nbe considered at least as good for a person than an alternate act if\nthe actual value the one act generates for that person is at\nleast as great as the expected value the alternate act\ngenerates for that person is inconsistent (Roberts 2009). \n\nThat philosophers would mistakenly reason to the result that the\napparent victim has not been made worse off is understandable. We see\nhow things in fact are for the slave child under the act in fact\nperformed, we see how precarious the child\u2019s coming into\nexistence is under any alternate act and we fail to notice that\n\u2013 calculated as of that moment just prior to choice \u2013 the\nchild\u2019s coming into existence is just as precarious under the\nact in fact performed. \n\nProbabilities under the act under scrutiny may decline even further in\ncases that involve clearer risks to health and wellbeing. Consider a\nman whose great-grandparents suffered in the Holocaust and who now\nmust ask himself what his attitude should be toward those atrocities.\nSince he is grateful for life itself, should he feel bad that he must\nalso be grateful to the agents of those atrocities for the role they\nplayed in bringing him into existence? On this proposal, he need not\nbe torn; his gratitude is misplaced. The atrocities may indeed have\nbeen a part of the causal chain ending in his existence. But there\nwere alternate causal chains as well that equally would have ended in\nhis existence had the relevant agents gone down those paths instead.\nIf anything, by jeopardizing the lives of Harry\u2019s own forebears\non a daily basis, the atrocities only served to further reduce his own\nchances of ever coming into existence at all.
