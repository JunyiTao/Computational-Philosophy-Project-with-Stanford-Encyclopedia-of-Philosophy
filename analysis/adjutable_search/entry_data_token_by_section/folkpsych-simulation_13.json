    "main_text": "The Role of Mental Simulation in Mindreading || Mindreading and Introspection\n4.4 Mindreading and Introspection\n\nFrom what we have said so far, one could expect that Gordon should\nagree with Goldman on at least one point. Clearly, Gordon has to admit\nthat there are some cases of mindreading in which a subject\nattributes a mental state to someone else through a judgment involving\nthe application of mentalistic concepts. Surely, Gordon cannot deny\nthat there are occasions in which we think things like Mary\nbelieves that John is late or Pat desires to visit\nLisbon. Being a Simulation Theorist, Gordon will also presumably\nbe eager to maintain that many such mindreading events are based on\nmental simulation events. But if Gordon admits that much, should he\nnot also concede that Goldman\u2019s Three-Stage Model is the right\naccount of at least those simulation-based mindreading\nevents? Surprising as it may be, Gordon still disagrees.\n\nGordon (1995) accepts that there are occasions in which a subject\narrives at a judgment about someone else\u2019s mental state\non the basis of some mental simulation event. He might also concede to\nGoldman that such a judgment involves mentalistic concepts (but see\nGordon\u2019s 1995 distinction between comprehending and\nuncomprehending ascriptions). Contra Goldman,\nhowever, Gordon argues that introspection plays no role at\nall in the generation of these judgments. Focusing on a specific\nexample will help us to clarify this further disagreement between\nGoldman and Gordon.\n\nSuppose that I know that Tom believes that (1) and (2):\n\nFido is a dog\nAll dogs enjoy watching TV\n\n\nOn this basis, I attribute to Tom the further belief that (3):\n\nFido enjoys watching TV\n\n\nGoldman\u2019s Three-Stage Model explains this mindreading act in the\nfollowing way. FIRST STAGE: I imagine believing what Tom believes\n(i.e., I imagine believing that (1) and (2)); I then feed those\nbelief-like imaginings into my reasoning mechanism (in the off-line\nmode); as a result, my reasoning mechanism outputs the imagined belief\nthat (3). The SECOND STAGE of the process consists in introspecting\nthis simulated belief and categorizing it as a belief.\nCrucially, in Goldman\u2019s model, \u201cintrospection\u201d does\nnot merely refer to the capacity to self-ascribe mental states.\nRather, it picks out a distinctive cognitive method for\nself-ascription, a method which is typically described as\nnon-inferential and quasi-perceptual (see the\nsection Inner sense accounts in the entry on\n self-knowledge).\n In particular, Goldman (2006) characterizes introspection as a\ntransduction process that takes the neural properties of a mental\nstate token as input and outputs a categorization of the type of\nstate. In the case that we are considering, my introspective mechanism\ntakes the neural properties of my token simulated belief as input and\ncategorizes it as a belief as output. After all this, the\nTHIRD STAGE occurs: I project the categorized belief onto Tom, through\nthe judgment Tom believes that Fido enjoys watching\nTV. (You might wonder where the content of Tom\u2019s\nbelief comes from. Goldman (2006) has a story about that too, but we\nwill leave this aside).\n\nWhat about Gordon? How does he explain, in a simulationist fashion but\nwithout resorting to introspection, the passage from knowing that Tom\nbelieves that (1) and (2) to judging that Tom believes that (3)?\nAccording to Gordon, the first step in the process is, of course,\nimagining to be Tom\u2014thus believing, in the context\nof the simulation, that (1) and (2). This results (again in the\ncontext of the simulation) in the formation of the belief that (3).\nBut how do I now go about discovering that *I*, Tom, believe that (3)?\nHow can one perform such a self-ascription if not via introspection? A\nsuggestion given by Gareth Evans will show us how\u2014Gordon\nthinks.\n\nEvans (1982) famously argued that we answer the question \u201cDo I\nbelieve that p?\u201d by answering another question, namely\n\u201cIs it the case that p?\u201d In other words, according\nto Evans, we ascribe beliefs to ourselves not by introspecting, or by\n\u201clooking inside\u201d, but by looking \u201coutside\u201d and\ntrying to ascertain how the world is. If, e.g., I want to know whether\nI believe that Manchester is bigger than Sheffield, I just ask myself\n\u201cIs Manchester bigger than Sheffield?\u201d If I answer in the\naffirmative, then I believe that Manchester is bigger than Sheffield.\nIf I answer in the negative, then I believe that Manchester is\nnot bigger than Sheffield. If I do not know what to answer,\nthen I do not have any belief with regard to this subject\nmatter.\n\nGordon (1986, 1995) maintains that this self-ascription\nstrategy\u2014which he labels \u201cthe ascent\nroutine\u201d (Gordon 2007)\u2014is also the strategy that we\nemploy, in the context of a simulation, to determine the mental states\nof the simulated agent:\n\n\nIn a simulation of O, I settle the question of whether O\nbelieves that p by simply asking \u2026 whether it is the\ncase that p. That is, I simply concern myself with the\nworld\u2014O\u2019s world, the world from O\u2019s\nperspective. \u2026 Reporting O\u2019s beliefs is\njust reporting what is there. (Gordon 1995: 60)\n\n\nSo, this is how, in Gordon\u2019s story, I come to judge that Tom has\nthe belief that Fido enjoys watching TV. In the context of the\nsimulation, *I* asked *myself* (where both \u201c*I*\u201d and\n\u201c*myself*\u201d in fact refer to Tom) whether *I* believe that\nFido enjoys watching TV. And *I* answered this question by answering\nanother question, namely, whether it is the case that Fido enjoys\nwatching TV. Given that, from *my* perspective, Fido enjoys watching\nTV (after all, from *my* perspective, Fido is a dog and all dogs enjoy\nwatching TV), *I* expressed my belief by saying: \u201cYes,\n*I*, Tom, believe that Fido enjoys watching TV\u201d. As you can see,\nin such a story, introspection does not do anything. (We will come\nback to the role of introspection in mindreading in\n section 6.2).\n",
