Historical and Bibliographical Remarks\n\n\n\u00a7\u00a71 and 2. Infinitary\npropositional and predicate languages seem to have made their first\nexplicit appearance in print with the papers of Scott and Tarski [1958]\nand Tarski [1958]. The completeness theorem for\n L(\u03c91,\u03c9), as well as for other\ninfinitary languages, was proved by Karp [1964]. The Hanf number\ncalculations for\n L(\u03c91,\u03c9) were first performed by\nMorley [1965]. The nondefinability of well-orderings in\nfinite-quantifier languages was proved by Karp [1965] and Lopez-Escobar\n[1966]. The interpolation theorem for\n L(\u03c91,\u03c9) was proved by\nLopez-Escobar [1965] and Scott's isomorphism theorem for\n L(\u03c91,\u03c9) by\nScott [1965]. Negri [2021] extends the idea of geometric logic originating in\ntopos theory to L(\u03c91,\u03c9).\n\n\nKarp's partial isomorphism theorem was first proved in Karp [1965];\nsee also Barwise [1973]. Result (2.2) appears in Chang [1968], result\n(2.3) in Ellentuck [1976] and result (2.4) in Bell [1981].\n\n\n\u00a73. Results (3.2) and (3.3) are due to Hanf\n[1964], with some refinements by Lopez-Escobar [1966] and Dickmann\n[1975], while (3.4) was proved by Tarski. Result (3.5) is due to Scott\n[1961], (3.6) to Bell [1970] and [1972]; and (3.7) to Bell [1974].\nMeasurable cardinals were first considered by Ulam [1930] and Tarski\n[1939]. The fact that measurable cardinals are weakly compact was noted\nin Tarski [1962].\n\n\n\u00a74.  Concerning the undefinability theorem\nfor L(\u03c91,\u03c91).\nCarol Karp remarks (1964, 166), \u201cAt the International Congress\nof Logic, Methodology and the Philosophy of Science at Stanford\nUniversity in 1960, Dana Scott circulated an outline of a proof of the\nimpossibility of a complete definable formal system for (\u03b3+,\n\u03b3+) languages with a single two-place predicate symbol in\naddition to the equality symbol.\u201d Scott never published his\nresult, and a fully detailed proof first appeared in Karp [1964].\nThe approach to the theorem adopted here is based on the account given\nin Dickmann [1975].\n\n\n\u00a75. The original motivation for the results\npresented in this section came from Kreisel; in his [1965] he pointed\nout that there were no compelling grounds for choosing infinitary\nformulas solely on the grounds of \u201clength\u201d, and proposed instead that\ndefinability or \u201cclosure\u201d criteria be employed. Kreisel's suggestion\nwas taken up with great success by Barwise [1967], where his\ncompactness theorem was proved. The notion of admissible set is due to\nPlatek [1966]. Theorem (5.6) is taken from Keisler [1974].\n\n\nFor further reading on the subject of infinitary languages, see Aczel\n[1973], Dickmann [1975], Karp [1964], Keisler [1974], and Makkai\n[1977].  A useful account of the connection between infinitary\nlanguages and large cardinals can be found in Chapter 10 of Drake\n[1974].\n",
