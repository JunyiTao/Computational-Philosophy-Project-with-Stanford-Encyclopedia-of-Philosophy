    "main_text": "Pragmatist Views\n4. Pragmatist Views\n\nPragmatists agree with QBists that quantum theory should not be\nthought to offer a description or representation of physical reality:\nin particular, to ascribe a quantum state is not to describe physical\nreality. But they deny that this makes the theory in any way\nsubjective. It is objective not because it faithfully mirrors the\nphysical world, but because every individual\u2019s use of the theory\nis subject to objective standards supported by the common knowledge\nand goals of the scientific community. So an individual\u2019s\nassignment of a quantum state may be correct (or incorrect) even\nthough no quantum state is an element of physical reality; Born\nprobabilities are similarly objective; and measurement is a physical\nprocess with a unique objective outcome, albeit\nepistemically-characterized.\n",
