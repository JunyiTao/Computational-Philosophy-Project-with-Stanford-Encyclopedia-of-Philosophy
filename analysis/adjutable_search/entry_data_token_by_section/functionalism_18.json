    "main_text": "Objections to Functionalism || Functionalism and Introspective Belief\n5.3 Functionalism and Introspective Belief\n\nAnother important question concerns the beliefs that we have about our\nown \u201coccurrent\u201d (as opposed to dispositional) mental\nstates such as thoughts, sensations, and perceptions. We seem to have\nimmediately available, non-inferential beliefs about these states, and\nthe question is how this is to be explained if mental states are\nidentical with functional properties.\n\nThe answer depends on what one takes these introspective beliefs to\ninvolve. Broadly speaking, there are two dominant views of the matter\n(but see Peacocke 1999, Ch. 5 for further alternatives). One popular\naccount of introspection \u2013 the \u201cinner sense\u201d model\non which introspection is taken to be a kind of \u201cinternal\nscanning\u201d of the contents of one\u2019s mind (Armstrong 1968)\n\u2013 has been taken to be unfriendly to functionalism, on the\ngrounds that it\u2019s hard to see how the objects of such scanning\ncould be second-order relational properties of one\u2019s neural\nstates (Goldman 1993). Some theorists, however, have maintained that\nfunctionalism can accommodate the special features of introspective\nbelief on the \u201cinner sense\u201d model, since it would be only\none of many domains in which it\u2019s plausible to think that we\nhave immediate, non-inferential knowledge of causal or dispositional\nproperties (Armstrong 1993; Kobes 1993; Sterelney 1993). A full\ndiscussion of these questions goes beyond the scope of this entry, but\nthe articles cited above are just three among many helpful pieces in\nthe Open Peer Commentary following Goldman (1993), which provides a\ngood introduction to the debate about this issue.\n\nAnother account of introspection, identified most closely with\nShoemaker (1996a,b,c,d), is that the immediacy of introspective belief\nfollows from the fact that occurrent mental states and our\nintrospective beliefs about them are functionally interdefined. For\nexample, one satisfies the definition of being in pain only if one is\nin a state that tends to cause (in creatures with the requisite\nconcepts who are considering the question) the belief that one is in\npain, and one believes that one is in pain only if one is in a state\nthat plays the belief role, and is caused directly by the pain itself.\nOn this account of introspection, the immediacy and non-inferential\nnature of introspective belief is not merely compatible with\nfunctionalism, but required by it.\n\nBut there is an objection, most recently expressed by George Bealer\n(1997; see also Hill 1993), that, on this model an introspective\nbelief can only be defined in one of two unsatisfactory ways: either\nas a belief produced by a (second-order) functional state specified\n(in part) by its tendency to produce that very type of belief \u2013\nwhich would be circular \u2013 or as a belief about the first-order\nrealization of the functional state, rather than that state\nitself. Functionalists have suggested, however (Shoemaker 2001,\nMcCullagh 2000, Tooley 2001), that there is a way of understanding the\nconditions under which beliefs can be caused by, and thus be about,\none\u2019s second-order functional states that permits mental states\nand introspective beliefs about them to be non-circularly defined (but\nsee Bealer 2001, for a skeptical response). A full treatment of this\nobjection involves the more general question of whether second-order\nproperties can have causal efficacy, and is thus beyond the scope of\nthis discussion (see section 5.2 and the\n mental causation\n entry). But even if this objection can ultimately be deflected, it\nsuggests that special attention must be paid to the functional\ncharacterizations of \u201cself-directed\u201d mental states.\n",
