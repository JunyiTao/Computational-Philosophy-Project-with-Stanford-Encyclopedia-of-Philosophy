    "main_text": "The Incongruity Theory\n4. The Incongruity Theory\n\nThe second account of humor that arose in the 18th century\nto challenge the Superiority Theory was the Incongruity Theory. While\nthe Superiority Theory says that the cause of laughter is feelings of\nsuperiority, and the Relief Theory says that it is the release of\nnervous energy, the Incongruity Theory says that it is the perception\nof something incongruous\u2014something that violates our mental\npatterns and expectations. This approach was taken by James Beattie,\nImmanuel Kant, Arthur Schopenhauer, S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, and many\nlater philosophers and psychologists. It is now the dominant theory of\nhumor in philosophy and psychology. \n\nAlthough Aristotle did not use the term incongruity, he hints\nthat it is the basis for at least some humor. In the Rhetoric\n(3, 2), a handbook for speakers, he says that one way for a speaker to\nget a laugh is to create an expectation in the audience and then\nviolate it. As an example, he cites this line from a comedy,\n\u201cAnd as he walked, beneath his feet were\u2014chilblains [sores\non the feet].\u201d Jokes that depend on a change of spelling or word\nplay, he notes, can have the same effect. Cicero, in On the\nOrator (ch. 63), says that \u201cThe most common kind of joke is\nthat in which we expect one thing and another is said; here our own\ndisappointed expectation makes us laugh.\u201d \n\nThis approach to joking is similar to techniques of stand-up comedians\ntoday. They speak of the set-up and the punch\n(line). The set-up is the first part of the joke: it creates the\nexpectation. The punch (line) is the last part that violates that\nexpectation. In the language of the Incongruity Theory, the\njoke\u2019s ending is incongruous with the beginning.\n\nThe first philosopher to use the word incongruous to analyze\nhumor was James Beattie (1779). When we see something funny, he says,\nour laughter \u201calways proceeds from a sentiment or emotion,\nexcited in the mind, in consequence of certain objects or ideas being\npresented to it\u201d (304). Our laughter \u201cseems to arise from\nthe view of things incongruous united in the same assemblage\u201d\n(318). The cause of humorous laughter is \u201ctwo or more\ninconsistent, unsuitable, or incongruous parts or circumstances,\nconsidered as united in one complex object or assemblage, as acquiring\na sort of mutual relation from the peculiar manner in which the mind\ntakes notice of them\u201d (320). \n\nImmanuel Kant (1790 [1911], First Part, sec. 54), a contemporary of\nBeattie\u2019s, did not used the term incongruous but had an\nexplanation of laughter at jokes and wit that involves\nincongruity.\n\n\nIn everything that is to excite a lively convulsive laugh there must\nbe something absurd (in which the understanding, therefore, can find\nno satisfaction). Laughter is an affection arising from the sudden\ntransformation of a strained expectation into nothing. This\ntransformation, which is certainly not enjoyable to the understanding,\nyet indirectly gives it very active enjoyment for a moment. Therefore\nits cause must consist in the influence of the representation upon the\nbody, and the reflex effect of this upon the mind.\n\n\nKant illustrates with this story:\n\n\nAn Indian at the table of an Englishman in Surat, when he saw a bottle\nof ale opened and all the beer turned into froth and overflowing,\ntestified his great astonishment with many exclamations. When the\nEnglishman asked him, \u201cWhat is there in this to astonish you so\nmuch?\u201d he answered, \u201cI am not at all astonished that it\nshould flow out, but I do wonder how you ever got it in.\u201d \n\n\nWe laugh at this story, Kant says, \u201cnot because we deem\nourselves cleverer than this ignorant man, or because of anything in\nit that we note as satisfactory to the understanding, but because our\nexpectation was strained (for a time) and then was suddenly dissipated\ninto nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must note well,\u201d Kant insists, that it [our\nexpectation] does not transform itself into the positive opposite of\nan expected object\u2026 but it must be transformed into\nnothing.\u201c He illustrates with two more jokes:\n\n\nThe heir of a rich relative wished to arrange for an imposing funeral,\nbut he lamented that he could not properly succeed; \u2018for\u2019\n(said he) \u2018the more money I give my mourners to look sad, the\nmore cheerful they look!\u2019\n\n[A] merchant returning from India to Europe with all his wealth in\nmerchandise \u2026 was forced to throw it overboard in a heavy storm\nand \u2026 grieved thereat so much that his wig turned gray the same\nnight.\u201d\n\n\nA joke amuses us by evoking, shifting, and dissipating our thoughts,\nbut we do not learn anything through these mental gymnastics. In humor\ngenerally, according to Kant, our reason finds nothing of worth. The\njostling of ideas, however, produces a physical jostling of our\ninternal organs and we enjoy that physical stimulation.\n\n\nFor if we admit that with all our thoughts is harmonically combined a\nmovement in the organs of the body, we will easily comprehend how to\nthis sudden transposition of the mind, now to one now to another\nstandpoint in order to contemplate its object, may correspond an\nalternating tension and relaxation of the elastic portions of our\nintestines which communicates itself to the diaphragm (like that which\nticklish people feel). In connection with this the lungs expel the air\nat rapidly succeeding intervals, and thus bring about a movement\nbeneficial to health; which alone, and not what precedes it in the\nmind, is the proper cause of the gratification in a thought that at\nbottom represents nothing.\n\n\nOn this point, Kant compares the enjoyment of joking and wit to the\nenjoyment of games of chance and the enjoyment of music. In all three\nthe pleasure is in a \u201cchanging free play of sensations,\u201d\nwhich is caused by shifting ideas in the mind. In games of chance,\n\u201cthe play of fortune\u201d causes bodily excitation; in music,\nit is \u201cthe play of tone,\u201d and in joking, it is \u201cthe\nplay of thought.\u201d In a lively game of chance, \u201cthe\naffections of hope, fear, joy, wrath, scorn, are put in play \u2026\nalternating every moment; and they are so vivid that by them, as by a\nkind of internal motion, all the vital processes of the body seem to\nbe promoted.\u201d In music and humor, similarly, what we enjoy are\nbodily changes caused by rapidly shifting ideas.\n\n\nMusic and that which excites laughter are two different kinds of play\nwith aesthetical ideas, or of representations of the understanding\nthrough which ultimately nothing is thought, which can give lively\ngratification merely by their changes. Thus we recognize pretty\nclearly that the animation in both cases is merely bodily, although it\nis excited by ideas of the mind; and that the feeling of health\nproduced by a motion of the intestines corresponding to the play in\nquestion makes up that whole gratification of a gay party.\n\n\nA version of the Incongruity Theory that gave it more philosophical\nsignificance than Kant\u2019s version is that of Arthur Schopenhauer\n(1818/1844 [1907]). While Kant located the lack of fit in humor\nbetween our expectations and our experience, Schopenhauer locates it\nbetween our sense perceptions of things and our abstract rational\nknowledge of those same things. We perceive unique individual things\nwith many properties. But when we group our sense perceptions under\nabstract concepts, we focus on just one or a few properties of any\nindividual thing. Thus we lump quite different things under one\nconcept and one word. Think, for example, of a Chihuahua and a St.\nBernard categorized under dog. For Schopenhauer, humor arises\nwhen we suddenly notice the incongruity between a concept and a\nperception that are supposed to be of the same thing. \n\n\nMany human actions can only be performed by the help of reason and\ndeliberation, and yet there are some which are better performed\nwithout its assistance. This very incongruity of sensuous and abstract\nknowledge, on account of which the latter always merely approximates\nto the former, as mosaic approximates to painting, is the cause of a\nvery remarkable phenomenon which, like reason itself, is peculiar to\nhuman nature, and of which the explanations that have ever anew been\nattempted, as insufficient: I mean laughter\u2026 . The cause of\nlaughter in every case is simply the sudden perception of the\nincongruity between a concept and the real objects which have been\nthought through it in some relation, and laughter itself is just the\nexpression of this incongruity (1818/1844 [1907], Book I, sec.\n13).\n\n\nAs an example, Schopenhauer tells of the prison guards who allowed a\nconvict to play cards with them, but when they caught him cheating,\nthey kicked him out. He comments, \u201cThey let themselves be led by\nthe general conception, \u2018Bad companions are turned out,\u2019\nand forget that he is also a prisoner, i. e., one whom they ought to\nhold fast\u201d (Supplement to Book I: Ch. 8). He also comments on an\nAustrian joke (the equivalent of a Polish joke in the U.S. a few\ndecades ago):\n\n\nWhen someone had declared that he was fond of walking alone, an\nAustrian said to him: \u201cYou like walking alone; so do I:\ntherefore we can go together.\u201d He starts from the conception,\n\u201cA pleasure which two love they can enjoy in common,\u201d and\nsubsumes under it the very case which excludes community.\n\n\nCreating jokes like these requires the ability to think of an abstract\nidea under which very different things can be subsumed. Wit,\nSchopenhauer says, \u201cconsists entirely in a facility for finding\nfor every object that appears a conception under which it certainly\ncan be thought, though it is very different from all the other objects\nwhich come under this conception\u201d (Supplement to Book I, Ch. 8).\n\n\nWith this theory of humor as based on the discrepancy between abstract\nideas and real things, Schopenhauer explains the offensiveness of\nbeing laughed at, the kind of laughter at the heart of the Superiority\nTheory. \n\n\nThat the laughter of others at what we do or say seriously offends us\nso keenly depends on the fact that it asserts that there is a great\nincongruity between our conceptions and the objective realities. For\nthe same reason, the predicate \u201cludicrous\u201d or\n\u201cabsurd\u201d is insulting. The laugh of scorn announces with\ntriumph to the baffled adversary how incongruous were the conceptions\nhe cherished with the reality which is now revealing itself to him\n(Supplement to Book I, Ch. 8).\n\n\nWith his theory, too, Schopenhauer explains the pleasure of humor.\n\n\n\nIn every suddenly appearing conflict between what is perceived and\nwhat is thought, what is perceived is always unquestionably right; for\nit is not subject to error at all, requires no confirmation from\nwithout, but answers for itself. \u2026 The victory of knowledge of\nperception over thought affords us pleasure. For perception is the\noriginal kind of knowledge inseparable from animal nature, in which\neverything that gives direct satisfaction to the will presents itself.\nIt is the medium of the present, of enjoyment and gaiety; moreover it\nis attended with no exertion. With thinking the opposite is the case:\nit is the second power of knowledge, the exercise of which always\ndemands some, and often considerable exertion. Besides, it is the\nconceptions of thought that often oppose the gratification of our\nimmediate desires, for, as the medium of the past, the future, and of\nseriousness, they are the vehicles of our fears, our repentance, and\nall our cares. It must therefore be diverting to us to see this\nstrict, untiring, troublesome governess, the reason, for once\nconvicted of insufficiency. On this account then the mien or\nappearance of laughter is very closely related to that of joy\n(Supplement to Book I, Ch. 8).\n\n\nLike Schopenhauer, S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard saw humor as based on\nincongruity and as philosophically significant. In his discussion of\nthe \u201cthree spheres of existence,\u201d (the three existential\nstages of life\u2014the aesthetic, the ethical, and the religious),\nhe discusses humor and its close relative, irony. Irony marks the\nboundary between the aesthetic and the ethical spheres, while humor\nmarks the boundary between the ethical and religious spheres.\n\u201cHumor is the last stage of existential awareness before\nfaith\u201d (1846 [1941], 448, 259). The person with a religious view\nof life is likely to cultivate humor, he says, and Christianity is the\nmost humorous view of life in world history ([JP], Entries\n1681\u20131682).\n\nKierkegaard (1846 [1941], 459\u2013468) locates the essence of humor,\nwhich he calls \u201cthe comical,\u201d in a disparity between what\nis expected and what is experienced, though instead of calling it\n\u201cincongruity\u201d he calls it \u201ccontradiction.\u201d For\nexample, \u201cErrors are comical, and are all to be explained by the\ncontradiction involved.\u201d He cites the story of the baker who\nsaid to the begging woman, \u201cNo, mother, I cannot give you\nanything. There was another here recently whom I had to send away\nwithout giving anything, too: we cannot give to everybody.\u201d\n\nThe violation of our expectations is at the heart of the tragic as\nwell as the comic, Kierkegaard says. To contrast the two, he appeals\nto Aristotle\u2019s definition of the comic in Chapter 5 of The\nPoetics: \u201cThe ridiculous is a mistake or unseemliness that\nis not painful or destructive.\u201d\n\n\nThe tragic and the comic are the same, in so far as both are based on\ncontradiction; but the tragic is the suffering contradiction, the\ncomical, the painless contradiction\u2026 . The comic apprehension\nevokes the contradiction or makes it manifest by having in mind the\nway out, which is why the contradiction is painless. The tragic\napprehension sees the contradiction and despairs of a way out.\n\n\nA few decades earlier, William Hazlitt contrasted the tragic and comic\nthis way in his essay \u201cOn Wit and Humor\u201d:\n\n\nMan is the only animal that laughs and weeps: for he is the only\nanimal that is struck with the difference between what things are, and\nwhat they ought to be. We weep at what thwarts or exceeds our desires\nin serious matters; we laugh at what only disappoints our expectations\nin trifles\u2026 . To explain the nature of laughter and tears, is\nto account for the condition of human life; for it is in a manner\ncompounded of the two! It is a tragedy or a comedy\u2014sad or merry,\nas it happens\u2026 . Tears may be considered as the natural and\ninvoluntary resource of the mind overcome by some sudden and violent\nemotion, before it has had time to reconcile its feelings to the\nchange of circumstances: while laughter may be defined to be the same\nsort of convulsive and involuntary movement, occasioned by mere\nsurprise or contrast (in the absence of any more serious emotion),\nbefore it has time to reconcile its belief to contrary appearances\n(Hazlitt 1819 [1907], 1).\n\n\nThe core meaning of \u201cincongruity\u201d in various versions of\nthe Incongruity Theory, then, is that some thing or event we perceive\nor think about violates our standard mental patterns and normal\nexpectations. (If we are listening to a joke for the second time, of\ncourse, there is a sense in which we expect the incongruous punch\nline, but it still violates our ordinary expectations.) Beyond that\ncore meaning, various thinkers have added different details, many of\nwhich are incompatible with each other. In contemporary psychology,\nfor example, theorists such as Thomas Schultz (1976) and Jerry Suls\n(1972, 1983) have claimed that what we enjoy in humor is not\nincongruity itself, but the resolution of incongruity. After age\nseven, Schultz says, we require the fitting of the apparently\nanomalous element into some conceptual schema. That is what happens\nwhen we \u201cget\u201d a joke. Indeed, Schultz does not even call\nunresolvable incongruity \u201chumor\u201d\u2014he calls it\n\u201cnonsense.\u201d The examples of humor cited by these theorists are typically jokes in\nwhich the punch line is momentarily confusing, but then the hearer\nreinterprets the first part so that it makes a kind of sense. When,\nfor instance, Mae West said, \u201cMarriage is a great institution,\nbut I\u2019m not ready for an institution,\u201d the shift in\nmeanings of \u201cinstitution\u201d is the incongruity, but it takes\na moment to follow that shift, and the pleasure is in figuring out\nthat the word has two meanings. Amusement, according to this\nunderstanding of humor, is akin to puzzle-solving. Other theorists\ninsist that incongruity-resolution figures in only some humor, and\nthat the pleasure of amusement is not like puzzle-solving. \n\nAs philosophers and psychologists refined the Incongruity Theory in\nthe late 20th century, one flaw in several older versions\ncame to light: they said, or more often implied, that the perception\nof incongruity is sufficient for humor. That is clearly false, since\nwhen our mental patterns and expectations are violated, we may well\nfeel fear, disgust, or anger and not amusement. James Beattie, the\nfirst philosopher to analyze humor as a response to incongruity, was\ncareful to point out that laughter is only one such response. Our\nperception of incongruity will not excite the \u201crisible\nemotion,\u201d he said, when that perception is \u201cattended with\nsome other emotion of greater authority\u201d such as fear, pity,\nmoral disapprobation, indignation, or disgust (1779, 420). \n\nOne way to correct this flaw is to say that humorous amusement is not\njust any response to incongruity, but a way of enjoying\nincongruity. Michael Clark, for example, offers these three features\nas necessary and sufficient for humor: \n\nA person perceives (thinks, imagines) an object as being\nincongruous.\n The person enjoys perceiving (thinking, imagining) the object.\n\n The person enjoys the perceived (thought, imagined) incongruity\nat least partly for itself, rather than solely for some ulterior\nreason (in Morreall 1987, 139\u2013155).\n\n\nThis version of the Incongruity Theory is an improvement on theories\nwhich describe amusement as the perception of incongruity, but it\nstill seems not specific enough. Amusement is one way of enjoying\nincongruity, but not the only way. Mike W. Martin offers several\nexamples from the arts (in Morreall, 1987, 176). Sophocles\u2019\nOedipus the King has many lines in which Oedipus vows to do\nwhatever it takes to bring King Laius\u2019 killer to justice. We in\nthe audience, knowing that Oedipus is himself that killer, may enjoy\nthe incongruity of a king threatening himself, but that enjoyment need\nnot be humorous amusement. John Morreall (1987, 204\u2013205) argues\nthat a number of aesthetic categories\u2014 the grotesque, the\nmacabre, the horrible, the bizarre, and the fantastic\u2014involve a\nnon-humorous enjoyment of some violation of our mental patterns and\nexpectations.\n\nWhatever refinements the Incongruity Theory might require, it seems\nbetter able to account for laughter and humor than the scientifically\nobsolete Relief Theory. It also seems more comprehensive than the\nSuperiority Theory since it can account for kinds of humor that do not\nseem based on superiority, such as puns and other wordplay. \n",
