    "main_text": "The Nature of Intuitions || Propositions, Properties, and Faculties\n1.4 Propositions, Properties, and Faculties\n\nIt has thus far been assumed that intuitions always take propositions\nas their objects. Some might disagree, holding that we have de\nre or objectual intuitions of properties or states of affairs.\nIndeed, it might be held that our de re grasp of various\nproperties is what grounds or justifies our assent to propositions\ninvolving them. Pursuit of this issue would require a detailed account\nof propositions and properties and their relations. It would also\nrequire detailed accounts of the de dicto and de re\nattitudes. None of these explorations can be undertaken here. It\nshould be noted, however, that such a conception of our de re\ngrasp of properties lurks under the surface of many rationalist\naccounts whether framed in terms of concepts or properties (Bealer\n1998; BonJour 1998) and is even more explicit in the claim that we\nhave knowledge by acquaintance of universals (Russell 1912).\n\nIn addition, the precise conception of propositional contents may have\nto be varied with the account of intuition. For example, those who\nappeal to propositions which seem true or which one is inclined to\nbelieve would presumably hold that what we are justified in believing\nvia rational intuition is not a pure Russellian proposition\nbut rather either a Fregean proposition or a Russellian proposition\nunder something like a mode of presentation.\n\nFinally, the focus above has been on intuitions as psychological\nstates or events. Sometimes the issues surrounding intuitions are\nframed in terms of whether there is a distinct faculty of\nintuition. Of course, to the extent that intuitions are causally\nexplicable, there is some process which produces them and\nsome may wish to call that process a \u201cfaculty.\u201d If that is\nall that is meant by the term, then no harm is done. Still, while such\ntalk may have its place (especially in various cognitive scientific\nattempts to explain the occurrence of intuitions), taking it to mean\nmore than just suggested seems to prejudice the issue of how much\nintuitive justification is like the justification produced by\nempirical faculties like vision and to invite dismissive caricatures\nof the view that intuitions serve to justify beliefs.\n",
