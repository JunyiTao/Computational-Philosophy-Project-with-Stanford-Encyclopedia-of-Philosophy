    "main_text": "New Directions || Individual-Based Models\n5.1 Individual-Based Models\n\n\nIn the type of population ecology that was discussed earlier (in\n Section 2),\n populations were characterized by their state variables,\nparameters such as size or density describing the population as a\nwhole and\u2014with two exceptions\u2014ignoring individual\ndifferences. The exceptions are age and stage; the age or stage\nstructure of populations (the fraction of individuals in each age or\ndevelopmental stage class) is sometimes incorporated in the\ntraditional models of population ecology. Since about 1980, that\nsituation began to change when the so-called \u201cindividual-based\nmodels\u201d (IBMs), which incorporate individual differences, began\nto be explored\n systematically.[87]\n IBMs represent a population as a collection of individuals with\nvariable properties such as size, growth-rate, biomass, and so on. The\ninteractions between individuals are incorporated into the\nmodel. Since, because of their sheer complexity, such models are\ntypically impossible to study analytically, they are studied by\nsimulation on a computer. The wealth of detail that can be\nincorporated into IBMs allows specific predictions to be made. Part of\nthe attraction of IBMs has been their relatively greater predictive\nsuccess compared to other types of ecological\n models.[88]\n\n\nIBMs are particularly useful because they can also be spatially\nexplicit (see\n Section 5.2),\n that is, they can incorporate locational relationships between the\nindividuals being modeled. These models have even been used to assess\nchange on a global scale. For instance, forest models (which are among\nthe most successful IBMs) have been used to assess the result of\nclimate change on the atmosphere because of a potential breakdown of\nthe presumed balance between production and decomposition of\ncarbon-containing compounds. Such an extrapolation of scale relies on\nsampling each of the terrestrial lifezones and constructing some IBMs\nfor all of them, and subsequently integrating the\n results.[89]\n The future will show how reliable this strategy is. IBMs have also\nrecently begun to be used for population viability analysis, tracking\nthe trajectory of each individual during its\n lifetime.[90]\n This use is likely to grow. In both the situations discussed here,\nthe main problem with the use of IBMs is the immense quantity of\nreliable data that they require.\n\n\nWithin the context of population ecology, since the behavior of the\nentire population is putatively being explained on the basis of the\nproperties of the individuals within them, using IBMs is,\nphilosophically, a reductionist strategy called \u201cmethodological\n individualism.\u201d[91]\n Here, \u201creductionism\u201d means that models of large systems\nshould try to explain their behavior entirely in terms of the\nproperties of their parts (nowhere referring to intrinsically\n \u201csystemic\u201d[92]\n properties). More specifically, such a reductionism amounts to the\nassumption that properties and interactions of individuals alone\nsuffice to explain all behavior at the level of populations (and\nhigher units): there is no need to refer to higher level or systemic\nproperties which cannot be defined in terms of individual properties\n(for instance, the density of a population).  Moreover, since\ninteractions between individuals of different species can also be\nincorporated into these models, community-level properties can also\npotentially be explained by IBMs. For instance, the structure of food\nwebs can potentially be explained by IBMs that take into account\nhabitat size and\n resources.[93]\n Thus, even community structure is potentially reducible\nto individual interactions. In this sense, community ecology, like\npopulation ecology, is also being reduced to\n IBMs.[94]\n In this way, IBMs are unifying at least these two subfields within\necology. Demarcation ambiguity is not a problem for IBMs; rather, it\nis a virtue. It remains surprising how little philosophical attention\nIBMs have so far received. If they succeed, they will help end the\nlong and, at least arguably, sterile tradition of anti-reductionism\n(or holism) in ecology.\n\n\nNevertheless, an important limitation of IBMs should not go unnoticed:\nmodels of this type\u2014that is, all models that have to be analyzed\nby computer simulation\u2014have the shortcoming that they often fail\nto provide theoretical insight in the sense of identifying the\ncritical heuristics or principles that are responsible for a type of\nbehavior. Are the dynamical rules responsible for some behavior? Or\nthe structural constraints, such as the initial conditions? Or the\nprecise parameter values? To answer such questions\u2014which is at\nleast part of what theoretical understanding consists\nof\u2014minimally requires the simulation of a large class of related\nmodels, often hard to achieve in practice. It remains the case that\nthese questions can often easily be answered using traditional\nmathematical models: an ounce of algebra may well be worth a ton of\ncomputer simulation. Thus any defense of reductionism in ecology based\non IBMs must be very limited.\n",
