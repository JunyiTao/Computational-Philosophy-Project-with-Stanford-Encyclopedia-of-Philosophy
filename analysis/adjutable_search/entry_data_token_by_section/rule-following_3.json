    "main_text": "The Sceptical Argument || The Normativity Condition\n2.2 The Normativity Condition\n\nAccording to a prominent line of thought, the notion of correctness\ninvolved in the seemingly platitudinous claim that meaningful\nexpressions have conditions of correct application is\nintrinsically normative. On this reading, meaning facts are\nnormative facts\u2014they not only sort the applications of\nexpressions into correct or incorrect, but also prescribe how\nexpressions ought to be applied. They issue semantic categorical\nobligations that bind speakers in determinate ways; the justified\napplications are precisely those that fulfil these semantic\nobligations. (The kind of normativity at stake is meaning engendered,\nrather than meaning determining; it is grounded in meaning, rather\nthan grounding meaning. See Gl\u00fcer and Wikforss 2009 for this\nhelpful distinction.)\n\nTo illustrate how the second condition, thus construed, constrains\naccounts of meaning, let us again consider Kripke\u2019s discussion\nof dispositionalism. He thinks that the dispositionalist offers\n\u201ca descriptive account\u201d of the relation between what one\nmeans by an expression and one\u2019s uses of that expression, but\nthat \u201cthis is not the proper account of the relation, which is\nnormative, not descriptive\u201d (1982: 37). More generally,\nKripke says, \u201cthe relation of meaning and intention to future\naction is normative, not descriptive\u201d (1982:\n37). Among the commentators who read the second condition in this way\nare Wikforss 2001, Gl\u00fcer and Wikforss 2009, Hattiangadi 2006 and\n2007, and Miller 2011, 2012. Thus construed, the sceptical argument\ncan be compared to arguments in metaethics that purport to establish,\nby drawing on J. L. Mackie\u2019s (1977) argument from queerness\nconcerning the seemingly problematic metaphysical and epistemological\nstatus of moral properties, an error-theory of moral judgment (Miller\n2010a, 2020). (See the entry on\n moral anti-realism.)[4]\n\nKripke\u2019s discussion has resulted in a vigorous debate about\nwhether meaning really is normative, as well as about how the\nnormativity of meaning is best understood. For a defence of the claim\nthat meaning is normative, see Whiting 2007, 2009, 2016 (note that\nWhiting focuses on the idea that meaning facts engender permissions to\napply words correctly and obligations not to apply them incorrectly,\nthough both the permissions and the obligations are defeasible). For\ncriticism of the view that meaning is normative, see Fodor 1990,\nGl\u00fcer and Pagin 1998, Gl\u00fcer 1999, Wikforss 2001, Boghossian\n2005, Miller 2006, Hattiangadi 2006, 2007, and Gl\u00fcer and Wikforss\n2009. (See also the entry on the\n normativity of meaning.)\n Some philosophers seek to carve a middle ground between the\nnormativist and the anti-normativist positions\u2014for instance, by\nclaiming that meaning facts are essentially justificatory (Gampel 1997), or\nthat they have hypothetical implications that are essential to them,\nthus being fundamentally unlike natural facts, which may be\nhypothetically normative only accidentally (Verheggen 2011; Chapter 2\nof Myers and Verheggen 2016). Hannah Ginsborg proposes a novel\nconception of normativity as more basic than rules (Ginsborg 2011b,\n2012, forthcoming), which we shall briefly discuss in the last\nsection.\n\nSome commentators take the normativity condition to amount to an\nagential requirement, one that primarily concerns the\napplications or uses of expressions. The thought is\nthat meaningful uses of expressions are not arbitrary\u2014they are\nnot unjustified leaps in the dark. An adequate conception of meaning\nmust be able to account for this. This view of the normativity\ncondition claims to shed light on Kripke\u2019s numerous appeals to\nthe metaphor of blindness (1982: 10, 15, 17, 23, 87). Kusch thinks\nthat the requirement of non-blindness is best understood as falling\nunder the purview of semantic normativity (which, contra the\nnormativist interpreters, he does not take to involve categorical\nobligations), and that it is best understood as indicating that the\nspeaker\u2019s \u201cmeaning-constituting mental state guides and\ninstructs\u201d her on how to apply the expression, that the speaker\n\u201ccan refer to this mental state in order to justify her\nuse\u201d of the expression, and that this state \n\n\nnot only justifies certain applications\u2014in the sense that\nmeaning addition justifies \u2018125\u2019 in answer to \u2018\\(68+57=\\ques\\)\u2019\u2014it\nalso\njustifies the way in which the answer is usually produced.\n(Kusch 2006: 8\u20139, italics added) \n\n\nAlong similar lines, it has been suggested that the\nmeaning-constituting facts be able to accommodate the idea that\n\u201cthe meaningful use of words must be revealed as\nintentional\u201d (Sultanescu and Verheggen 2019, 13; Sultanescu\nforthcoming). The paradox has also been interpreted as belonging \n\n\nto the philosophy of rational explanation, of explanations that\naccount for what people do or think by citing their reasons for doing\nor thinking so. (Bridges 2014: 249; see also Bridges 2016)\n\n\nSome interpreters take the sceptical argument to involve the\nimposition of an epistemological constraint\u2014a constraint related\nto the epistemic justification of semantic judgments, rather\nthan to the rationality of the applications of expressions. Warren\nGoldfarb notes that Kripke \u201cdoes seem to mean that the\njustifications must in some sense be transparent\u201d (1985 [2002:\n98]). Jos\u00e9 Zalabardo takes Kripke to be demanding that the\nmeaning-constituting facts provide speakers with justification for\ntheir judgments about the correctness of the applications of their\npredicates. Justification is construed in an internalist sense:\nspeakers possess the relevant justification if the procedure through\nwhich they decide whether predicates apply to objects involved\n\u201cconscious engagement with the facts that determine how\nthese questions should be answered\u201d (1997 [2002: 286]). (See\nalso Jackman 2003, Guardo 2012, and Merino-Rajme 2015). Crispin Wright\nproposes a more specific epistemic constraint, namely, that of\naccounting for the seemingly puzzling fact that the epistemology of\nmeaning is first-person authoritative even though meaning something by\nan expression is in crucial respects akin to having a dispositional\ntrait. In Wright\u2019s words, the constraint is to explain \n\n\nhow it is possible to be effortlessly, non-inferentially and generally\nreliably authoritative about psychological states which have no\ndistinctive occurrent phenomenology and which have to answer, after\nthe fashion of dispositions, to what one says and does in situations\nso far unconsidered. (2001: 150)\n\n\nNote that all the construals of the second condition appear to put\npressure on dispositionalism over and above that exerted by the\nextensionality condition. Prima facie, dispositional facts are facts\nabout what we will or would do, not about what we ought to do;\ndispositional facts appear not to be essentially justificatory or\nhypothetically prescriptive; dispositions do not justify or\nrationalise their manifestations, and in making semantic judgements we\ndo not typically engage with facts about our linguistic dispositions;\nlastly, it is unclear how a dispositional account of meaning could be\nrendered consistent with its intuitive first-person epistemology. See\n section 4\n for further discussion of dispositionalism.\n",
