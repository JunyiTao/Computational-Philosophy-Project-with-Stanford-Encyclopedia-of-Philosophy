    "main_text": "The later Luk\u00e1cs: Praxis, Totality, and Freedom || The Ontology of Social Being\n4.4 Aesthetics: Realism and the Work of Art as a Closed Totality\n\nWhile Luk\u00e1cs made his ontological commitments explicit only\ntowards the end of his life, they informed the development of his\naesthetics from the 1930s on. From the general materialist premises of\nhis ontology and from his rejection of the epistemology of History\nand Class Consciousness in favor of the Leninist alternative (see\n1938), it follows that cultural and mental phenomena must always be\nseen as reflections (or \u201cmirroring,\u201d\nWiderspiegelungen) of an objective reality (GW 11:\n22, 55).\n\nLike science and ethics, art breaks with the immediacy of our everyday\npractical engagements that dominates more common forms of reflection\n(GW 11: 207, 214). Yet aesthetic reflections on reality\ndiffer from science (or more generally from conceptual and theoretical\nreflections) in three respects: First, while scientific knowledge\npresupposes the \u201cdeanthropomorphization\u201d of the subject\nmatter (meaning that reality is presented as independent of human\ndesires or subjectivity), the aesthetic subject matter remains\nanthropomorphized insofar as art presents reality in the form of inner\nexperience. Thus, aesthetic representation always remains connected to\na possible \u201cevocation\u201d of a human subject\u2019s reactions\n(GW 11: 438). Second, while science is always conceptually\nmediated, art breaks with the immediacy of everyday life in favor of a\nnew immediacy of experience (GW 11: 237, 509, 513). And\nthird, while science reflects reality in the form of general laws,\naesthetic representation is always bound to represent universal\naspects of the essence of reality in the form of the individuality (or\nspecificity) of the work of art (Luk\u00e1cs\u2019s term for\nindividuality is Besonderheit, a concept which he takes from\nHegel\u2019s Science of Logic, where it describes the\ndialectical sublation of both generality and particularity within the\n\u201cnotion\u201d).\n\nAccording to this conception of art as a mode of reflection, the\nfunction of a work of art is to present humans with the totality of\nthe objective, historical reality within an \u201chomogeneous\nmedium\u201d (such as pure visibility in painting or poetic language\nin poetry; see GW 11: 642). The employment of such a medium\nmakes it possible for art to single out and represent the universal\naspects of a given form of human reality as a \u201cclosed\nworld-in-itself\u201d or as an \u201cintensive totality\u201d\n(GW 11: 238, 461, 774; GW 12: 232). As Luk\u00e1cs\nargues (GW 11: 660), the medium of each specific form of art\nestablishes strict laws that allow the work of art to adequately\npresent the world of humanity from a specific standpoint. For this\nreason, such works of art allow us to comprehend the universal aspects\nof our existence and to consciously participate in the collective life\nof humanity (GW 11: 519\u2013530). Luk\u00e1cs describes\nthis effect as \u201cdefetishization\u201d (GW 11: ch. 9),\nanticipating the ethical call to overcome alienation formulated in the\nOntology. A successful work of art can thus have the effect\nof \u201ccatharsis\u201d (GW 11: 811), transforming the\n\u201cwhole person\u201d of everyday life (the person who is\nentangled in their diverse relationships) into a \u201cperson as a\nwhole\u201d (the person who realizes their humanity by acquiring a\nsense of self-consciousness regarding the richness of the human\nrelations that constitute the historical development of\nhumankind).\n\nEven though they represent objective reality, works of art are, in\nvirtue of this mode of reflection, subject-dependent because their\ncharacter is constituted by their capacity to evoke a subjective\nreaction: i.e., an understanding of how and why the world revealed in\nart is appropriate to the comprehending subject in its universal\nnature (GW 11: 305). This reaction is not only one of passive\nacknowledgment; it also actively transforms the subject by\nfacilitating consciousness of that very universal nature. Thus, in the\nwork of art, subjectivity and objectivity are mutually constitutive of\neach other. In a transformed sense\u2014as Luk\u00e1cs explicitly\nacknowledges (GW 11: 582; GW 12: 217)\u2014the\nsubject-object of idealism is an appropriate concept for works of art\n(which, one might add, fulfills Luk\u00e1cs\u2019s aspirations for the\nsocialist revolution he had to renounce, both politically and\nphilosophically). Of course, in this new sense the term\n\u201csubject-object\u201d no longer signifies a privileged agent\nbecoming self-conscious, but only the interdependence of subjectivity\nand objectivity in a specific sphere of experience.\n\nLuk\u00e1cs makes a similar conceptual move by endorsing the claim\nthat all consciousness is a reflection of reality. On the one hand,\nthis signals a revision of the epistemological position he defended in\nHistory and Class Consciousness (where he criticized the\ndistinction between a seemingly objective reality and purely\nsubjective forms of perception) in favor of Lenin\u2019s theory of\nconsciousness. On the other hand, Luk\u00e1cs is keen to make\nroom\u2014at least within the boundaries of the aesthetic\u2014for\nthe idea that some insights can be had only in relation to a totality\nthat encompasses subjectivity and objectivity.\n\nAt this point, Luk\u00e1cs no longer derives his aesthetic\ncommitments from purely philosophical premises\u2014as he did in his\nearly Heidelberg writings\u2014instead building on anthropological\npremises (especially concerning the concept of everyday life, in\nregard to which he notes the similarity between his analysis and\nHeidegger\u2019s notion of practical engagement; see GW 11:\n68\u201371; for related points on the Ontology see Jo\u00f3s\n1982), psychological theorizing (proposing an extension of Pavlov\u2019s\nbehaviorist classification of signal systems; see GW 12:\n11\u2013191), and a speculative notion of world history. The most\nimportant concept binding these premises together is the idea of\nmimesis. Mimetic behavior, Luk\u00e1cs argues, is a\nfundamental way of coping with the world and a source of both magic\nand art. Through the mimetic imitation of natural processes, humans\nacquire the ability to represent the salient aspects of the world in a\nclosed and totalizing manner, gradually learning to separate such\nimitations from the necessity of immediate reaction. In contrast to\nmagic, which does not separate reflection and objective causation,\nmimesis in art is consciously taken as reflection and has an aesthetic\neffect on its audience specifically in virtue of this feature\n(GW 11: 382). In other words, while both art and science\novercome the superstition of magic, only art can retain the mimetic\ndimension of representation.\n\nLuk\u00e1cs\u2019s commitment to a conception of the work of art as a\nclosed totality structured by the strict laws of its medium and\nobjectively reflecting the development of humanity in the mode of\nmimetic evocation had considerable implications for his own judgments\nas an aesthetic theorist. His writings on literary realism published\nfrom the 1930s to the 1950s\u2014especially \u201cRealism in the\nBalance\u201d (1938), The Historical Novel (1955), and\nThe Meaning of Contemporary Realism (1955)\u2014display to\nvarious degrees a mixture of philosophical insight and Stalinist\northodoxy. In any case, they are animated by a strong commitment to\nthe superiority of realism, as exemplified by Balzac, Tolstoy, Gorky\n(see GW 5), and Thomas Mann (see 1949), which he contrasts\nwith the \u201cdecadent\u201d avant-garde literature of his time.\nThis position drew sharp criticism, for example from Seghers, Brecht,\nand Adorno (see Luk\u00e1cs 1981; Brecht 1977; Adorno [1958] 1977;\non the Luk\u00e1cs-Brecht debate, see Pike 1985).\n\nHowever, to the extent that Luk\u00e1cs\u2019s commitment to realism\nreflects a commitment to the notion that works of art should present a\ntotality of meaning that is not alien to the life of individuals but\nrather overcomes the alienation they suffer in everyday life, it\nexpresses (even in its most distorted versions) an intuition that\nsustained his work from the beginning: a desire to overcome the\ntension between human life and the objective social forms that\nconstitute modern society.\n",
