    "main_text": "Logic\n3. Logic\n\nKilvington\u2019s Sophismata, written before 1325, is his\nonly logical work. A sophisma or sophism is neither a\nstandard paradox of disputation nor a sophistical argument but a\nstatement the truth of which is in question. The first sophism\nKilvington discusses typifies the basic structure: a statement of the\nsophism sentence followed by a case or hypothesis, arguments for and\nagainst the sophism sentence, the resolution of the sophism sentence\nand reply to the arguments on the opposing side, ending with an\nintroduction to the next sophism sentence.\n\nKilvington\u2019s sophisms are meant to be of logical interest, but\nthey also pose important questions in physics or natural philosophy.\nIn constructing his sophisms, Kilvington sometimes makes use of\nobservable physical motion and at other times appeals to imaginable\ncases that have no reference to outside reality. Although the latter\ncases are impossible physically, they are theoretically possible,\ni.e., they do not involve a formal contradiction. At one point he\nwrites, \u201cthus even though the hypothesis supposed there is\nimpossible in fact \u2026 it is nevertheless possible per se; and\nfor purposes of the sophisma, that is enough [unde licet casus\nidem positus sit impossibilis de facto \u2026 tamen per se\npossibilis est; et hoc sufficit pro sophismate]\u201d (S 29: 69;\ntr. Kretzmann and Kretzmann 1990b: 68).\n\nThe first eleven sophisms deal with the process of whitening, in which\nthe motion of alteration is conceived as a successive entity\nextrinsically limited at its beginning and end. There is no first\ninstant of alteration, claims Kilvington, but only a last instant\nbefore the alteration begins; likewise, there is no last instant of\nalteration, but only the first instant at which the final degree has\nbeen introduced. There is no minimum degree of whiteness or speed\ngained in motion, but rather smaller and smaller degrees ad infinitum\ndown to zero, since the qualities change continuously. Integers are\npotentially infinite because one can always find a higher integer, but\nnot actually infinite since there is no single infinite number. In\nKilvington\u2019s view, since any continuity\u2014e.g., time, space,\nmotion, heat, whiteness\u2014is infinitely divisible, it can be\nspoken of quantitatively and measured in terms of infinite sets of\nintegers. The subjects of sophisms 29\u201344 reveal\nKilvington\u2019s special interest in local motion with respect to\ncauses, i.e., active and passive potencies, and effects, i.e., time,\ndistance traversed, and speed in motion. He considers both uniform and\ndifform motion caused by voluntary agents and points out the\nquestionable measure of instantaneous speed through the comparison of\nspeed in uniform and accelerated motion (see Kretzmann 1982).\n\nThe last four sophisms are ostensibly connected with epistemology and\nthe logic of knowledge, i.e., sentences on knowing and doubting\ninvolving intentional contexts, such as S45: \u201cYou know this to\nbe everything that is this\u201d. The most interesting among them is\nS47, \u201cYou know that the king is seated\u201d, where Kilvington\ncalls some rules of obligational disputation into question (see\nKretzmann and Kretzmann 1990: 330\u201447; d\u2019Ors 1991). In the\nopinion of Stump, \u201cwhat Kilvington has done in his work on S47,\nby his change in the rule for irrelevant propositions, is to shift the\nwhole purpose of obligations\u201d (Stump 1982: 332).\n",
