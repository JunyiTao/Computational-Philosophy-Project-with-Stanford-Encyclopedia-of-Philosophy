    "main_text": "Relative Identity\n6. Relative Identity\n\nIn the previous two sections, we discussed various ways of challenging\nthe first two premises of the argument for coincident entities. Let us\nnow turn our attention to the third and final premise: If David\ndid not exist on Monday and Lump did exist on Monday, then David is\nnot identical to Lump. The premise follows from Leibniz\u2019s\nLaw: for any x and y, if x is identical to\ny, then x and y share all of the same\nproperties. The denial of Leibniz\u2019s Law therefore provides one\nway of resisting the final premise of the argument.\n\nThe denial of Leibniz\u2019s Law is sometimes associated with Peter\nGeach (1962, 1967), who defends a view called the relative\nidentity theory. Geach\u2019s central thesis is that there is no\nrelation of absolute identity\u2014identity is always relative to\na kind. Thus, we can say that David is the same\nstatue as Lump and we can say that David is the same lump\nof clay as Lump, but it makes no sense to say that David is the\nsame as Lump simpliciter. The consequent of the third premise\nis therefore nonsense, like saying \u2018David is not taller\nthan\u2019. More generally, Geach rejects the standard formulation of\nLeibniz\u2019s Law as incomplete, since it includes a non-relativized\nidentity predicate. In this way, the relative identity theorist is\nable to block the third step of the argument for coincident\nobjects.\n\nGeach makes many interesting claims about the behavior of relative\nidentity relations. For example, he claims that it is possible for\na to be the same K as b, but not the same\nK*, where \u2018K\u2019 and\n\u2018K*\u2019 are sortal terms denoting distinct kinds.\nTake, for example, the Debtor\u2019s Paradox. In that case, we have\nan earlier portion of matter, M1, and a later portion of\nmatter M2. According to Geach, M1 is not the\nsame portion of matter as M2, but it is the same person. In\nthis way, he is able to allow for the persistence of persons through\nchanges in parts. (See the entry on\n relative identity\n for more details.)\n\nThe relative identity theorist may deny the standard formulation of\nLeibniz\u2019s Law, but there is significant pressure to accept\nsome version of that principle since it seems to capture a\ncentral fact about identity. An obvious suggestion is to offer a\nrelativized version of Leibniz\u2019s Law: for any x and\ny, if x is the same K as y, then x\nand y share all of the same properties (where \u2018K\u2019\nis a sortal denoting a kind). If Geach\u2019s relative identity\nrelations do not conform to this law, one might worry that they are\nnot identity relations at all. And here we have a potential\nproblem. Take the case of David and Lump. As we have seen, some\nphilosophers want to say that David is both a statue and a lump of\nclay (it is not a mere lump of clay, since it is also a\nstatue, but it is still a lump of clay). Lump is obviously a lump of\nclay. Since there is only one lump of clay on Tuesday, David must be\nthe same lump of clay as Lump. But then, by the relativized version of\nLeibniz\u2019s Law, David and Lump must share all of the same\nproperties. This, once again, seems false. Lump existed on Monday, but\nDavid did not, so there is at least one property that Lump has and\nDavid lacks. In response, the relative identity theorist might appeal\nto another component of Geach\u2019s view. Geach suggests that proper\nnames are always associated with kinds. For example,\n\u2018David\u2019 is associated with the kind statue and\n\u2018Lump\u2019 is associated with the kind lump of clay.\nTaking a cue from the counterpart theorist (section 3), the relative\nidentity theorist may go on to claim that this association creates\nopaque contexts when we ascribe modal properties. Take, for example,\nthe following pair of statements:\n\nLump existed on Monday.\nDavid existed on Monday.\n\n\nThe relative identity theorist could say that (1) is true if and only\nif there was a lump of clay on Monday which is the same lump\nof clay as Lump. (2), on the other hand, is true just in case there\nwas statue on Monday which is the same statue as David. Given\nthese truth conditions, (1) is true and (2) is false, for there was a\nlump of clay on Monday (the same lump of clay as Lump), but no statue.\nMore importantly, on this analysis the predicates in (1) and (2)\nexpress different properties, in which case the relativized version of\nLeibniz\u2019s Law has no application. So, one cannot move from (1)\nand the negation of (2) to the conclusion that Lump and David are\ndistinct lumps of clay.\n\nA second worry for Geach is that it seems as if the relative identity\ntheory cannot solve all of the puzzles with which we began. Take, once\nagain, the Ship of Theseus Puzzle. In that case, we have the original\nship of Theseus (A), the museum\u2019s ship (B), and the\ncustodian\u2019s ship (C). The problem is that B seems to be the same\nship as A, which seems to be the same ship as C. If the same ship\nas relation is transitive, we get the absurd conclusion that B is\nthe same ship as C. The relative identity theorist might deny\ntransitivity, of course, but this would give us another reason to\nsuspect that relativized identity relations are not really\nidentity relations at all (Gupta 1980).\n\nA third and final worry for Geach concerns his denial of absolute\nidentity. As many commentators have pointed out, this denial has\ndrastic implications for logic, semantics, and set theory. To take\njust one example, consider the set theorist\u2019s axiom of\nextensionality: for any sets A and B, if\nA and B have the same members, then A is\nthe same set as B. Let A be David\u2019s unit set\nand let B be Lump\u2019s unit set. Is A the same\nset as B? The relativist must reject this question as\nill-formed. It makes no sense to ask whether x and y\nare the same members, since this requires a notion of absolute\nidentity (intuitively, \u2018member\u2019 does not denote a genuine\nkind, so \u2018same member as\u2019 does not express a relative\nidentity relation). As a result, the relative identity theorist must\ndeny extensionality, which throws set theory into jeopardy (Hawthorne\n2004).\n",
