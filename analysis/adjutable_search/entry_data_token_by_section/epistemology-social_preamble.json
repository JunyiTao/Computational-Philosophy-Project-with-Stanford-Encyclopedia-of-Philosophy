    "main_text": "\n\nUntil recently, epistemology\u2014the study of (the nature, sources,\nand pursuit of) knowledge\u2014was heavily individualistic in focus.\nThe emphasis was on the pursuit of knowledge by individual subjects,\ntaken in isolation from their social environment. Social epistemology\nseeks to redress this imbalance by investigating the epistemic effects\nof social interactions, practices, norms, and systems. After briefly\ndiscussing the history of the field in sections 1 and 2, we move on to\ndiscuss central topics in social epistemology in section 3. Section 4\nturns to recent approaches which use formal methods to characterize\nthe functioning of epistemic communities like those in science. In\nsection 5 we briefly turn to social epistemological approaches to the\nproper functioning of democratic societies, including responses to\nmis/disinformation as well as to the variety of epistemic dysfunctions\nthat arise when we are in community with others.\n",
