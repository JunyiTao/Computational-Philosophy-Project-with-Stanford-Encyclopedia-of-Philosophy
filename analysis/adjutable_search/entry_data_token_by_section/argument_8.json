    "main_text": "Types of Argumentation || Adversarial and cooperative argumentation\n3.1 Adversarial and cooperative argumentation\n\nA question that has received much attention in the literature of the\npast decades pertains to whether the activity of argumentation is\nprimarily adversarial or primarily cooperative. This question in fact\ncorresponds to two sub-questions: the descriptive question of\nwhether instances of argumentation are on the whole primarily\nadversarial or cooperative; and the normative question of\nwhether argumentation should be (primarily) adversarial or\ncooperative. A number of authors have answered \u201cadversarial\u201d to the\ndescriptive question and \u201ccooperative\u201d to the normative\nquestion, thus identifying a discrepancy between practices and\nnormative ideals that must be remedied (or so they claim; Cohen 1995).\n\n\nA case in point: recently, a number of far-right Internet personalities\nhave advocated the idea that argumentation can be used to overpower\none\u2019s opponents, as described in the book The Art of the\nArgument: Western Civilization\u2019s Last Stand (2017) by the\nwhite supremacist S. Molyneux. Such aggressive practices reflect a\nvision of argumentation as a kind of competition or battle, where the\ngoal is to \u201cscore points\u201d and \u201cbeat the\nopponent\u201d. Authors who have criticized (overly) adversarial\npractices of argumentation include (Moulton 1983; Gilbert 1994; Rooney\n2012; Hundleby 2013; Bailin & Battersby 2016). Many (but not all)\nof these authors formulated their criticism specifically from a\nfeminist perspective (see entry on\n feminist perspectives on argumentation).\n\nFeminist critiques of adversarial argumentation challenge ideals of\nargumentation as a form of competition, where masculine-coded values\nof aggression and violence prevail (Kidd 2020). For these authors,\nsuch ideals encourage argumentative performances where excessive use\nof forcefulness is on display. Instances of aggressive argumentation\nin turn have a number of problematic consequences: epistemic\nconsequences\u2014the pursuit of truth is not best served by\nadversarial argumentation\u2014as well as moral/ethical/political\nconsequences\u2014these practices exclude a number of people from\nparticipating in argumentative encounters, namely those for whom\ndisplays of aggression do not constitute socially acceptable behavior\n(women and other socially disadvantaged groups in particular). These\nauthors defend alternative conceptions of argumentation as a\ncooperative, nurturing activity (Gilbert 1994; Bailin & Battersby\n2016), which are traditionally feminine-coded values. Crucially, they\nview adversarial conceptions of argumentation as optional,\nmaintaining that the alternatives are equally legitimate and that\ncooperative conceptions should be adopted and cultivated.\n\nBy contrast, others have argued that adversariality, when suitably\nunderstood, can be seen as an integral and in fact desirable component\nof argumentation (Govier 1999; Aikin 2011; Casey 2020; but notice that\nthese authors each develop different accounts of adversariality in\nargumentation). Such authors answer \u201cadversarial\u201d both to\nthe descriptive and to the normative questions stated above. One\noverall theme is the need to draw a distinction between (excessive)\naggressiveness and adversariality as such. Govier, for example,\ndistinguishes between ancillary (negative) adversariality and minimal\nadversariality (Govier 1999). The thought is that, while the feminist\ncritique of excessive aggression in argumentation is well taken,\nadversariality conceived and practiced in different ways need not have\nthe detrimental consequences of more extreme versions of belligerent\nargumentation. Moreover, for these authors, adversariality in\nargumentation is simply not optional: it is an intrinsic feature of\nargumentative practices, but these practices also require a background\nof cooperation and agreement regarding, e.g., the accepted rules of\ninference.\n\nBut ultimately, the presumed opposition between adversarial and\ncooperative conceptions of argumentation may well be merely apparent.\nIt may be argued for example that actual argumentative encounters\nought to be adversarial or cooperative to different degrees, as\ndifferent types of argumentation are required for different situations\n(Dutilh Novaes forthcoming). Indeed, perhaps we should not look for a\none-fits-all model of how argumentation ought to be conducted across\ndifferent contexts and situation, given the diversity of uses of\nargumentation.\n",
