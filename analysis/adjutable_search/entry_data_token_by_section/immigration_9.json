    "main_text": "Arguments for Open Borders || Cosmopolitan Egalitarianism\n2.1 Cosmopolitan Egalitarianism\n\n\nThe cosmopolitan egalitarian case for open borders combines the core\nmoral insight that all human beings, whether they are compatriots or\nforeigners, are equally deserving of moral consideration with the\ncentral empirical observation that one\u2019s country of birth often\nhas a profound impact upon one\u2019s life prospects. The\nstaggering levels of international inequality would not be so\nobjectionable if the typical Swede had done something to deserve a\nbetter life than the typical Chadian, for instance, but the truth, of course, is that\nSwedes were merely lucky to have been born in Sweden rather than\nChad. And given this, what justification could the Swedes have\nfor putting guns at their borders to deter Chadians from trying to move\nnorth and take advantage of the preferable social, political and\neconomic environment? In the eyes of cosmopolitan egalitarians,\nthey have none. As Joseph Carens puts it, \u201cCitizenship in\nWestern liberal democracies is the modern equivalent to feudal\nprivilege\u2014an inherited status that greatly enhances one\u2019s\nlife chances. Like feudal birthrights privileges, restrictive\ncitizenship is hard to justify when one thinks about it closely.\u201d\n(Carens 1987: 252) In other words, egalitarians regard open\nborders as the requisite response to the enormous economic inequalities\nwhich currently exist between countries.\n\n\nThis case for open borders presumes a specific, highly contentious\nversion of cosmopolitan egalitarianism. Thus, if one were not an\negalitarian (or, more specifically, if one were not a so-called\n\u201cluck\u201d egalitarian who believes that justice requires that\nwe correct for all inequalities which stem merely from luck), or if\none denied that egalitarian (or at least luck egalitarian)\nconsiderations extend beyond one\u2019s political borders, then one would\nbe unmoved by this argument. More importantly, even if one accepts all\nof the cosmopolitan egalitarian\u2019s moral premises, it is not clear that\nthe desired conclusion follows. This is because wealthy states seem to\nhave other ways to fulfill their duties of distributive justice. Even\nif Sweden has demanding duties of distributive justice to Chad, for\ninstance, why may Sweden not keep its borders closed as long as it\ntransfers the requisite amount to Chad? That is certainly how we\nhandle duties of distributive justice in the domestic realm. Consider\nJeff Bezos, for instance.  While there are various accounts of Bezos\u2019s\nduties to share his wealth with those who are less fortunate, no one\nsupposes that he must remarry, adopt or otherwise open his family to a\npoor person.  Rather, whatever he must transfer to others, everyone\nagrees that he can exclude others from his home life as long as he\nfulfills his duties of distributive justice.  And if duties of\ndistributive justice do not undermine an individual\u2019s right to freedom\nof association in the domestic realm, why need they do so for a state\nin the international arena? If Jeff Bezos need not open his home to\nthose who are less fortunate, then why must Sweden welcome poor\nforeigners into their political community?\n",
