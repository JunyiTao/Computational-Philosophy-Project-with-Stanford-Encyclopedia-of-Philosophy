    "main_text": "Objections to Disjunctivism\n4. Objections to Disjunctivism\n\n\nSome of the objections raised against disjunctive theories are\ndirected at the specific arguments proposed in support of different\nversions of disjunctivism. For discussion of objections to the\narguments proposed by Hinton and McDowell, see sections 3.1, and 3.2;\nand for objections to arguments proposed by Martin see sections 3.3\nand 3.4. For objections to disjunctivist accounts of hallucination,\nsee section 5. Some arguments against certain versions of\ndisjunctivism are directed against what are taken to be some of the\nmetaphysical commitments of the na\u00efve realist account of veridical\nperception. For example, Pautz (forthcoming) argues that na\u00efve realism\nabout veridical perception carries commitments about the metaphysical\nstatus of observable qualities, such as colour, that are undermined by\nempirical science. This section discusses arguments aimed at a more\ngeneral level, against the disjunctivist\u2019s denial that veridical\nperceptions, illusions and hallucinations are mental events of the\nsame fundamental kind, and in favour of the view that there is common\nelement to veridical perception, illusion and hallucination.\n",
