    "main_text": "Epicurean background\n4. Epicurean background\n\nEpicurus (341\u2013270 BCE), an Athenian citizen, began teaching and\namassing disciples in Mytilene on the isle of Lesbos and then at\nLampsacus on the coast of Asia Minor before establishing his school in\nAthens in 306 BCE. In a property later known as the Garden, Epicurus\nand his friends lived a closed community life devoted to philosophy,\nin retreat from politics, and practiced an austere to ascetic\nlifestyle. The latter was the case despite Epicureans\u2019\ncommitment to hedonism (Tsouna, 2020). Outside accusations of hedonism\nwere thus strictly correct, but not sympathetic or informed. In\nAthens, alongside his collaborators Metrodorus (331\u2013278 BCE) and\nHermarchus, who succeeded him in 270 BCE, Epicurus continued to\nproduce instalments of his On nature, which eventually\ntotaled 37 volumes. The monumental On nature appears to have\nbeen the foundational text for Epicureanism, so much so that school\nmembers could make shorthand references among themselves to individual\nbook numbers, omitting the title (reconstruction in Sedley 1998 ch.\n4). Even so, it was only one of many works produced by Epicurus and\nthe first generation of Epicureans, collectively referred to by later\nEpicureans as \u2018the men\u2019 (Mitsis ed. 2020 has surveys\nof all aspects of Epicureanism; on the life of the school,\nsee ch. 1 by Dorandi)\n\nBy the late Hellenistic period, the Garden was one of the four main\nphilosophical systems that competed for the allegiance of the educated\nelite. Although all were originally headquartered in Athens, by the\nfirst century BCE the schools had representatives and active branches\nthroughout the Mediterranean. In first-century Italy, the Epicureans\nseems to have been especially successful in recruiting prominent\nRomans, for example Atticus the banker, Cicero\u2019s friend and\ncorrespondent, Cassius, the future assassin of Caesar, and\nCaesar\u2019s father-in-law L. Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus. The last\nof these was closely associated with or more likely the patron of\nPhilodemus of Gadara (c. 110\u201330 BCE), a prominent Epicurean\nphilosopher and accomplished poet, who taught in the area of the Bay\nof Naples. The damaged and difficult-to-read carbonized papyrus rolls\nfirst recovered in the 18th century at the Villa dei Papiri\nin Herculaneum are to all appearances Philodemus\u2019 working\nlibrary. They include Philodemus\u2019 own philosophical works, some\ndrafts or teaching texts, a good number of classic Epicurean texts,\namong which books from the On nature, sometimes in multiple\ncopies, a number of standard works from rival schools, and even a few\nLatin manuscripts (Del Mastro 2014; Capasso 2020).\n\nThe Epicureans were noted for their doctrinal conservatism, with\northodoxy controlled by appeal to the textual authority of the works\nof \u2018the men\u2019 (Sedley 1989). Lucretius is in keeping with\nthis when he writes in the proem to book 3:\n\nYou I follow, O glory of the Graecian race, and now on the marks you\nhave left I plant my own footsteps firm, not so much desiring to be\nyour rival, as for love, because I yearn to copy you\u2026 You are\nour father, the discoverer of truths, you supply us a father\u2019s\nprecepts from your scrolls, from your pages, illustrious man, as bees\ndrink all they can in the flowery glades, so we likewise feed on your\ngolden words, golden, ever most worthy of life eternal. (3.3\u201313\nRouse-Smith transl. with modifications).\n\n\nAs noted above, his own reverence for and enjoyment of these Greek\nprose texts does not require the honey of poetic inducements, but to\nLucretius the Epicurean, they are all at once authoritative,\nbeneficial, and supremely enjoyable. It is worth noting, however, that\nthe order of comparisons made in the fuller passage, not quoted above,\nrely on established poetic tropes used when a minor poet invokes the\nexample of a master (Volk 2002: 108\u2013115). Lucretius therefore,\nin the act of affirming his faith in Epicurus the philosopher,\nretroactively casts Epicurus in the mold of a master poet. This shows\nan active capacity to shape and color the material.\n\nDespite such coloring, Lucretius makes it clear that he will not\ndeviate from his master\u2019s doctrinal path. Indeed, two of the\ngreatest peculiarities of the DRN relate directly to this\nfaithfulness. First, as best we can tell, Lucretius\u2019\npresentation of Epicurean physics is not \u2018live\u2019, in the\nsense that it makes no attempt to update or defend the Epicurean\nsystem in light of later scientific developments, for instance the\nvictory of \u2018head\u2019 over \u2018chest\u2019 as the seat of\nthe soul, thanks to the discovery of the nerves by Hellenistic doctors\n(von Staden 1989, Leith 2020). Second and related to the first is the\nabsence of any explicit inter-school polemics, especially the kind one\nwould come to expect from reading the works of Philodemus or the\ndialogues of Cicero. The main named philosophical adversaries in the\nwork are the three Presocratic philosophers deployed at\n1.635\u2013920 as the champions of alternative theories of matter.\nAlthough it is tempting to infer that the various anti-teleological or\nanti-providential critiques in the DRN are aimed at the\nStoics, Furley, in an influential (1966) article argued that in all\nsuggested instances the polemical targets are more likely Platonic or\nAristotelian (fullest reply in Schmidt 1990, with\ncounter-reply in Sedley 1998 ch 3). At most, the Stoics may\nbe included among the implicit targets of various anonymous views\ncriticised by Lucretius, but none of these are ever named. The closest\nwe get is an alleged Latin pun where, in calling the followers of\nHeraclitus stolidi, \u2018stupid\u2019, some think\nLucretius is referring to Stoici, the Stoics (Bailey 1947\nvol. II on 1.641 and 1.1068).\n\nHow should we understand this? Before considering some possible\nanswers, it will be useful to include two more factors: the question\nof Lucretius\u2019 sources, and second, the school\u2019s views on\npoetry.\n\nThe problem of Lucretius\u2019 sources is to a certain extent\nacademic since, as just seen, we can be confident that Lucretius\nreproduces Epicurean doctrine faithfully. Despite that, and while also\nrecognizing that we only have access to a fraction of the material\nthat may have been available to Lucretius, a bit of stock-taking will\nhelp clarify the background.\n\nFirst, then, there is the material we possess. Thanks to Diogenes\nLaertius\u2019 recycling of them into Book 10 of his Lives of the\nPhilosophers, we have three letters by Epicurus himself. These\nare: the Letter to Herodotus: a brief summary of his physics;\nthe Letter to Pythocles on celestial phenomena, which\nexemplifies the Epicurean use of multiple explanations for those\nphenomena not open to closer examination; the Letter to\nMenoeceus: a more basic introduction to his moral philosophy.\nBeyond that, we have ancient collections of maxims culled from the\ncorpus, especially the Key doctrines, plus various\nancient reports, fragments and list of titles of lost works, to which\nwe can add the material from Herculaneum, which includes portions of\nthe different books On nature and those of other Epicureans,\nPhilodemus foremost. (The most up-to-date collection of all material,\nwith extensive notes, is the French translation by Delattre and\nPigeaud eds. 2010).\n\nAmong these sources, we can eliminate the Letter to\nHerodotus, in other respects the most relevant extant text.\nLucretius cannot have relied on it, because the DRN is a\nlarger and more detailed treatment. Importantly, Lucretius\u2019 case\nfor atoms and void is the fuller one, designed for beginners.\nInterestingly, though, as noted above, the Letter\u2019s\norder of exposition matches that of the DRN, or at least the\norder we can discern before Lucretius changed the order of books\n3 and 4. If we next consider the On nature, it will be\nuncontroversial that it was in some sense Lucretius\u2019 ultimate\nsource, but also obvious that Lucretius will not have wanted to\nreproduce all of its contents. In any case, the 37 books of On\nnature were not a single continuous exposition, although certain\nsections of it did function as sequential units.\n\nBeyond that, the evidence is too complex for detailed examination, so\nwe can pass instead to scholarly theories. Over a century ago Giussani\n(1896), followed by many, for example Bailey (1947 vol. I pp.\n24\u20135), suggested that another known summary, the lost Great\nEpitome, was Lucretius\u2019 main source. The appeal here is\nthat the putative source seems to be closer in scale to the\nDRN, and possibly more suited to beginners, but other than\nthat there is very little to go on. Later in the 20th\ncentury the trend was towards recognizing more Lucretian autonomy in\nshaping and organizing the material (Clay 1983, Schrijvers 1999).\nAgainst that, the most detailed investigation into this background so\nfar, Sedley 1998, argues that the first 15 books of the On\nnature were Lucretius\u2019 main initial source, which he\ngradually reshaped and compressed. Even for those who disagree with\nits thesis, this study is the starting-point for subsequent\ndiscussion, because it is the first to incorporate developments in\nHerculaneum papyrology since the 1970s, importantly our improved\nknowledge of the On nature, to which Sedley himself has\ncontributed significantly.\n\nSince that study, the most significant development has been G.\nLeone\u2019s magisterial (2012) edition of On nature II,\nwhose best-preserved sections deal with the Epicurean doctrine of the\neidola, the thin films of atoms emitted by all larger bodies\nand which form the external basis of vision. On the one hand, the new\nedition seems to reinforce Sedley\u2019s thesis, in so far as we can\nnow see that the order of exposition found in On nature II is\nindeed reproduced both in the Letter to Herodotus and in\nLucretius. In the Letter to Herodotus, section 45 is\non infinite worlds, followed by sections 46\u201348 on the\neidola. In Leone\u2019s 2012 edition, columns 1\u20136,\nthough poorly preserved, clearly mention the infinity of atoms being\nresponsible for an infinity of worlds, kosmoi. Then, although\nwe lack textual evidence for a transition, what remains of the next\n114 columns deal with the eidola. In Lucretius, provided we\nfactor in the swap of books 3 and 4, we have the same sequence: after\nthe conclusion of DRN 2 on infinite worlds, the\nsimulacra are dealt with at DRN 4.54\u2013216 (=\nbook 3 in the earlier draft). On the other hand, and somewhat\nbafflingly, this makes it more difficult to imagine the contents of\nOn nature I, since that single book now seems insufficient to\ncover all the material abridged into Herodotus sections\n37\u201344. For that reason, Sedley had argued that the\neidola section of Book 2 must have covered no more than a\nfifth of that book (1998 p. 112). But Leone\u2019s edition suggests\nsomething more like four fifths.\n\nFrom sources let us now consider one final peculiarity of the\nDRN, the apparent clash between the project itself, a\ndidactic poem on Epicurean physics, and the reported hostility to\npoetry in Epicureanism. This topic has been much discussed, but it is\npossible to think that its paradox has been overplayed, especially in\nearlier scholarship (start rather at Obbink ed. 1995; full survey in\nMcOsker 2020). Epicurus is indeed reported to have been critical of\npoetry, perhaps not specifically relating to verse itself, but as part\nof the broader Epicurean rejection of conventional ideas and the\ncentral role played by poetry in ancient education. So far, this is\nmerely the \u2018ancient quarrel between poetry and philosophy\u2019\n(Republic 607b5\u20136) with an Epicurean twist. More\nnarrowly, Epicureans\u2019 hostility to verse may have been sharpened\nby the wish to demarcate themselves from the early Stoics\u2019\nembrace of poetry as making a positive contribution to elevated or\nsublime content. Philodemus, in order to record his contempt for the\nview, reports that the Stoic Diogenes of Babylon reported that the\nearlier Stoic Cleanthes claimed: \u2018meters, melodies, and rhythms\napproach as closely as possible to the truth of the contemplation\n(\u03b8\u03b5\u03c9\u03c1\u03af\u03b1\u03c2) of divine things\n(\u03b8\u03b5\u03af\u03c9\u03bd)\u2019 (Philodemus On\nMusic 4, ed. Delattre 142.5\u201322; discussion in Asmis 2017).\nWe also have reports of Epicurean arguments criticising the use of\nverse as not adding anything to the content. That is, Epicureans held\nthat the arguments and doctrines were what helped us achieve peace of\nmind, ataraxia, and literary format does not contribute\nanything to that (Sextus Empiricus Adv. Math. 1.299). Closer\nto Lucretius, there is the case of Philodemus, who wrote extensively\non poetics and rhetoric and was himself an accomplished poet. The fact\nthat Philodemus was a poet makes a complete ban on poetry in\nEpicureanism very unlikely, as opposed to, perhaps, a distinction\nbetween poetry as entertainment and more serious philosophical\ncontent. More positively, both Philodemus and Lucretius display a wide\nand deep knowledge of literature. Yet Philodemus did not write poetry\non philosophical topics, so there remains a gap between Philodemus and\nLucretius.\n\nWe can now review attempts make sense of these features as a whole,\nnamely Lucretius\u2019 anachronistic reliance on Epicurus alone, the\nabsence of inter-school polemics, and the possible clash with his\nown\u2019 school\u2019s views on poetry. To account for these, a\nrange of motivations have been suggested. Perhaps the least generous\nview is that, operating mainly as a poet, Lucretius found in\nEpicureanism, or rather its foundational texts, an engaging subject\nfor poetry (Volk 2002). More generously, we can imagine that even if\nLucretius was a committed Epicurean, he may have been isolated from\nthe philosophical mainstream and not fully conversant with the most\nup-to-date version of his denomination, and even something of a\nfundamentalist, seeing no need to go beyond the master\u2019s words\n(Sedley 1998 ch. 3). More generously still, the narrowing of focus we\nfind in the DRN could have been a deliberate simplification\nfor the sake of a more appealing introductory work. The mix of\nphilosophical argument, rhetoric and poetic imagery found in the\nDRN is typical of protreptic literature, which must avail\nitself of imagery and rhetorical persuasion to render the hearer more\nreceptive to its philosophical arguments (De Lacy 1948; on emotional\nappeal, O\u2019Keefe 2021; on rhetoric Markovic 2008). Poetry,\nmoreover, is the best medium in which to express the intense emotional\nimpact of such conversion, in this instance the \u2018heavenly\ndelight\u2026 and awe\u2019 (3.28\u20139 divina\nvoluptas\u2026 atque horror) Lucretius felt at\nEpicurus\u2019 revelation of the true nature of the universe. One of\nLucretius\u2019 favorite images, used no less than four times in the\nDRN, is that of illumination: our fear of the unknown, before\nEpicurus illuminated it, makes us like children afraid of the\ndark.\n\nOn any reading of Lucretius\u2019 motivations, it will be helpful in\nto keep in mind some simplifications that he has made in the material.\nFirst, the single divine savior Epicurus replaces the plural authority\nof \u2018the men\u2019 and their different works. Second, technical\nlanguage is largely avoided. Third, Lucretius focuses mainly on\nintroductory exposition and uses a starker set of contrasts between\nerror and truth, darkness and illumination, before and after Epicurus.\nThat is at the expense of more extensive or complex technical content,\nof dealing with developments in contemporary science or of scoring\npoints in inter-school polemics. Two positive features, however, are\nnot lost in the translation to Latin verse. First, Lucretius retains a\nstrong commitment to clarity and careful organization\n(stoicheiosis) of the system, with explicit statements of\npoints needing proof, supporting arguments, transitions between\npoints, and a general care not to rely upon points not yet proven.\nSecond is an appeal to empirical data and careful use of analogies to\nconstruct theories. Among these Lucretius will often seek out examples\nfamiliar to his own Roman audience, an effective way of carrying\npoints.\n",
