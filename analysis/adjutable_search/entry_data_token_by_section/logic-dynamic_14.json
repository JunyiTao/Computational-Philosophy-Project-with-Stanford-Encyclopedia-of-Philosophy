    "main_text": "Some variants || PDL with intersection\n5. Conclusion\n\nThis article has focused on propositional dynamic logic and some of\nits significant variants. There are by now a number of\nbooks\u2014Goldblatt [1982], Goldblatt [1992a], Harel [1979] and\nHarel, Kozen and Tiuryn [2000]\u2014and survey papers\u2014Harel\n[1984], Kozen and Tiuryn [1990], Parikh [1983] \u2014treating PDL and\nrelated formalisms. Pratt offers in Pratt [2017] an informal and\npersonal perspective on the development of dynamics logics which also\nhas a historical value. The body of research on PDL is certainly\ninstrumental in developing many logical theories of system dynamics.\nHowever, these theories are arguably out of the scope of the present\narticle. Van Eijck and Stokhof [2006] is a more recent overview of\ntopics making use of dynamic logic, addressing various themes that are\nof certain interest for philosophers: e.g., dynamics of communication,\nor natural language semantics. Recent books are going in much details\non newer topics, such as dynamic logic of knowledge (dynamic epistemic\nlogic) in Van Ditmarsch, Van Der Hoek and Kooi [2007], and the dynamic\nlogic of continuous and hybrid systems (differential dynamic logic) in\nPlatzer [2010]. PDL was conceived primarily for reasoning about\nprograms. There are many other applications of modal logic to the\nreasoning about programs. Algorithmic logic is closer to PDL since it\nallows one to talk explicitly about programs. The reader is invited to\nconsult the work presented in Mirkowska and Salwicki [1987]. Temporal\nlogics are now the chief logics in theoretical computer science and\nhave a close connection with logics of programs. They allow one to\nexpress the temporal behavior of transition systems with a language\nthat abstracts away from the labels (hence the programs). See for\ninstance Schneider [2004] for an overview of the foundations in this\nresearch area.\n",
