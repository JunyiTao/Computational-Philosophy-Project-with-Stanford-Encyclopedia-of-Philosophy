For\nexample, provided it is true that the sun is made of gas and also true\nthat elephants have four legs, then the truth-functional conditional\n\u201cIf elephants have four legs, then the sun is made of gas\u201d\nis also true. However, the gaseous nature of the sun would not\nnormally be regarded as either a conceptually, or even a contingently,\nnecessary condition of the quadripedality of elephants. Indeed,\naccording to the standard theory, any truth will be a necessary\ncondition for the truth of every statement whatsoever, and any\nfalsehood will be a sufficient condition for the truth of any\nstatement we care to consider.\n\nThese odd results do not arise in some non-classical logics where it\nis required that premisses be relevant to the conclusions drawn from\nthem, and that the antecedents of true conditionals are likewise\nrelevant to the consequents. But even in those versions of relevance\nlogic which avoid some of these odd results, it is difficult to avoid\nall of the so-called \u201cparadoxes of implication\u201d(see the\nentry on\n the logic of conditionals\n and\n relevance logic).\n For example, a contradiction (a statement of the form\n\u201cp and not p\u201d) will be a sufficient\ncondition for the truth of any statement unless the semantics for the\nlogic in question allow the inclusion of inconsistent worlds. \n\nThese oddities might be dismissed as mere anomalies were it not for\nthe fact that writers have identified a number of other problems\nassociated with the ideas of reciprocity and equivalence mentioned at\nthe end of the previous section. According to the standard theory,\nthere is a kind of reciprocity between necessary and sufficient\nconditions, and \u201cif p, q\u201d sentences can\nalways be paraphrased by \u201cp only if q\u201d\nones. However, as writers in linguistics have observed, neither of\nthese claims matches either the most natural understanding of\nnecessary (or sufficient) conditions, or the behaviour of\n\u201cif\u201d (and \u201conly if\u201d) in English. Consider, for\nexample, the following case (drawn from McCawley 1993, p. 317):\n\nIf you touch me, I\u2019ll scream.\n\n\nWhile in the case of (i) above, using the key was necessary for\nopening the door, no parallel claim seems to work for (ii): in the\nnatural reading of this statement, my screaming is not a condition for\nyour touching me. James McCawley claims that the\n\u201cif\u201d-clause in a standard English statement gives the\ncondition\u2014whether epistemic, temporal or causal\u2014for the\ntruth of the \u201cthen\u201d-clause. The natural interpretation of\n(ii) is that my screaming depends on your touching me. To take my\nscreaming as a necessary condition for your touching me seems to get\nthe dependencies back to front. A similar concern arises if it is\nmaintained that (ii) entails that you will touch me only if I\nscream.\n\nA similar failure of reciprocity or mirroring arises in the case of\nthe door example ((i) above). While opening the door depended,\ntemporally and causally, on using the key first, it would be wrong to\nthink that using the key depended, either temporally or causally, on\nopening the door. So what kind of condition does the antecedent state?\nIt may be helpful to consider the following puzzling pair of\nconditional sentences (a modification of Sanford 1989,\n175\u20136):\n\nIf he learns to play, I\u2019ll buy Lambert a cello.\nLambert learns to play only if I buy him a cello.\n\n\nNotice that these two statements are not equivalent in meaning, even\nthough the standard theory treats \u201cif p,\nq\u201d as just another way of saying \u201cp only\nif q\u201d. While (iii) states a condition under which I buy\nLambert a cello (presumably he first learns by using a borrowed one,\nor maybe he hires one), (iv) states a (necessary) condition of Lambert\nlearning to play the instrument in the first place (there may be\nothers too). Understood this way, the statements taken together leave\npoor old Lambert with no prospect of ever getting the cello from me.\nBut if (iv) were just equivalent to (iii), combining the two\nstatements would not lead to an impasse like this.\n\nBut how else can we formulate (iii) in terms of \u201conly if\u201d?\nA natural English equivalent is surprisingly hard to formulate.\nPerhaps it would be something like:\n\nLambert has learned to play the cello only if I have bought him\none.\n\n\nwhere the auxiliary (\u201chas\u201d/\u201chave\u201d) has been\nintroduced to try to keep dependencies in order. Yet (v) is not quite\nright, for it can be read as implying that Lambert\u2019s success is\ndependent on my having first bought him a cello\u2014something that\nis certainly not implied in (iii). A still better (but not completely\nsatisfactory) version requires further adjustment of the auxiliary,\nsay:\n\nLambert will have learned to play the cello only if I have bought\nhim one.\n\n\nThis time, it is not so easy to read (vi) as implying that I bought\nLambert a cello before he learned to play. These changes in the\nauxiliary (sometimes described as changes in \u201ctense\u201d) have\nled some writers to argue that conditionals in English involve\nimplicit quantification across times (see, for example, von Fintel\n1998). \n\nAn alternative view is that different kinds of dependency are\nexpressed by use of the conditional construction: (iv) is not\nequivalent to (iii) because the consequent of (iii) provides what\nmight be called a reason for thinking that Lambert has\nlearned to play the cello. By contrast, the very same\ncondition\u2014that I buy Lambert a cello\u2014appears to fulfil a\ndifferent function in (iv) (namely that I first have to buy him a\ncello before he learns to play). In the following section, the\npossibility of distinguishing between different kinds of conditions is\ndiscussed. The existence of such distinctions would seem to provide\nsome evidence for a systematic ambiguity about the meaning of\n\u201cif\u201d and in the concepts of necessary (and\nsufficient) condition.\n\nThe possibility of ambiguity in these concepts raises a further\nproblem for the standard theory. According to it\u2014as Georg Henrik\nvon Wright points out (von Wright 1974, 7)\u2014the notions of\nnecessary condition and sufficient condition are themselves\ninterdefinable:\n\nA is a sufficient condition of B\n=df the absence of A is a necessary\ncondition of the absence of B\n\nB is a necessary condition of A\n=df the absence of B is a sufficient\ncondition of the absence of A\n\nAmbiguity would threaten this neat interdefinability. In the following\nsection, we will explore whether there is an issue of concern here.\nThe possibility of such ambiguity figures in work by Peter Downing on\nso-called \u201csubjunctive\u201d conditionals (Downing1959) and is\nexplored subsequently as a more general problem in Wilson (1979),\nGoldstein et al. (2005), ch. 6, and later writers. The general\nargument, in brief, is that in some contexts there is a lack of\nreciprocity between necessary and sufficient conditions understood in\na certain way, while in other situations the conditions do relate\nreciprocally to each other in the way required by the standard theory.\nIf ambiguity is present, then there is no general conclusion that can\nsafely be drawn about reciprocity, or lack of it, between necessary\nand sufficient conditions. Instead there will be a need to distinguish\nthe sense of condition that is being invoked in a particular context.\nWithout specification of meaning and context, it would also be wrong\nto make the general claim that sentences like \u201cif p,\nq\u201d are generally paraphrasable as \u201cp\nonly if q\u201d. The philosophical literature contains\nnumerous ways to make sense of the lack of reciprocity between the two\nkinds of conditions. Using a semi-formal argument, Carsten Held, for\nexample, has suggested a way of explaining why necessary and\nsufficient conditions are not converses by making appeal to a version\nof truthmaker theory (Held 2016 \u2013 see Other Internet Resources).\nIn what follows, the entry focuses on a rather different and possibly\nmore widely accepted approach: the attempt to make sense of the lack\nof reciprocity in terms of the difference between inferential,\nevidential and explanatory uses of conditionals.\n",
