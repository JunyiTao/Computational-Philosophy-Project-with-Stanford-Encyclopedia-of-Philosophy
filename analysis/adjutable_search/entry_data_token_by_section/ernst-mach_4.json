    "main_text": "Psychology and the Life Sciences || Gestalt Theory\n3.3 Gestalt Theory\n\n\nThis central Machian insight that perception is always relational and\nconstructed lies at the origins of Gestalt Theory. The seminal article\nof Gestalt Theory, Christian von Ehrenfels\u2019 1890\n\u201c\u00dcber Gestaltqualit\u00e4ten,\u201d begins with a\nreview of these ideas, found in Mach\u2019s 1886 Analysis of\nSensations. Sensations are not simply raw experiences, but the\ninteraction of experience with a pre-formed cognitive structure. For\ninstance, when we hear a known melody, we recognize it no matter what\nkey it is played in. It can be hummed, buzzed, or strummed on a\nguitar. Furthermore, even if one or more notes are incorrect, we still\nrecognize it. Mach asks, \u201cwhat constitutes a melody?\u201d It\nseems incorrect to say that the actual sound vibrations constitute the\nmelody as we have just seen that numerous different sounds can make\nthe same melody. But on the other hand, it seems empirically odd to\nsay that a melody is not constituted out of its sounds. The actual\nmelody, then, exists in our ability to recognize it. It is formed by\nexperience of one or more examples of the melody, but it is an\nidealization of that experience. Significantly, the idealization\ncaptures not the actual sounds, but the relationships of the\nsounds to one another. Thus a melody can be sung in a high or low\npitch, etc., but as long as the relationships remain the same we\nrecognize it as the same melody. For Mach, this process is at the\nbasis of all perception. Experience requires an \u2018a\npriori\u2019, but that a priori is itself formed by\nexperience.  This process is also at the root of evolutionary\nprocesses.\n",
