    "main_text": "Criteria: What Counts? || Other approaches\n2.4 Other approaches\n\nRecent scholarship includes some novel approaches to the legal\ndefinition of rape. MacKinnon, for instance, has recommended that a\nbroadened understanding of force (as including hierarchies of power)\nshould be supplemented not by a nonconsent requirement, but by a\nstandard of \u201cwelcomeness.\u201d A consent standard, she\nobserves, incorporates gender hierarchy by assuming that men initiate\nsexual contact which women then either accept or refuse, whereas a\nwelcomeness standard suggests the centrality of \u201cchoice,\nmutuality, and desire\u201d (2005, 243). She explains her approach as\nfollows:\n\nThe idea here is not to prohibit sexual contact between hierarchical\nunequals per se but to legally interpret sex that a hierarchical\nsubordinate says was unwanted in the context of the forms of force\nthat animate the hierarchy between the parties. To counter a claim\nthat sex was forced by inequality, a defendant could (among other\ndefenses) prove the sex was wanted\u2014affirmatively and freely\nwanted\u2014despite the inequality, and was not forced by the\nsocially entrenched forms of power that distinguish the parties.\n(247\u201348)\n\n\nMacKinnon also recommends the passage of new, sex-equality-based civil\nrights laws that sexual assault victims can use against their\nattackers. Such laws, in her view, would offer survivors a kind of\ndignity and control that criminal prosecutions often do not, while\nattaching the \u201cstigma of bigotry\u201d to perpetrators\n(248).\n\nAnderson (2005b) urges the elimination of both the force requirement\nand the nonconsent requirement, and the adoption in their place of\nwhat she calls the \u201cnegotiation model.\u201d She contrasts her\napproach with the two most common \u201creform\u201d positions,\nwhich she calls the No Model and the Yes Model. According to the No\nModel, a sexual act is consensual unless the victim says no or resists\nphysically. According to the Yes Model, a sexual act is rape unless\nconsent is affirmatively granted (by verbal or physical behavior).\nAgainst the No Model, Anderson points out that many victims suffer\nperitraumatic paralysis and/or dissociation\u2014that is, conditions\nat the time of trauma that render them unable to protest or resist.\nFurthermore, both the No and Yes models rely heavily on men\u2019s\nability to interpret women\u2019s nonverbal behavior, despite strong\nevidence showing that men routinely fail in this endeavor: the No\nModel, for instance, allows a man to infer consent from a\nwoman\u2019s silence and lack of physical resistance. Finally, both\nmodels in practice tend to assume that a woman\u2019s willing\nparticipation in non-penetrative sexual activity is a reliable\nindicator of her consent to penetration (for instance, Anderson points\nout that according to Schulhofer, an advocate of the Yes Model, a\nwoman\u2019s engaging in heavy sexual petting typically indicates her\naffirmative willingness to have intercourse). This assumption,\nAnderson emphasizes, is not only often untrue but, in the age of AIDS,\nespecially dangerous.\n\nLike MacKinnon, Anderson sees a fundamental problem in the notion of\nsexual consent as \u201ca woman\u2019s passive acquiescence to male\nsexual initiative\u201d (1406). Negotiation, in contrast,\n\u201csuggests not the granting of permission for the actions of\nanother \u2026 but an active consultation with someone else to come\nto a mutual agreement\u201d (1421). The negotiation model thus\nrequires \u201cconsultation, reciprocal communication, and the\nexchange of views before a person initiates sexual penetration\u201d\n(1421). (This requirement of consultation before penetration\ndistinguishes Anderson\u2019s approach from Pineau\u2019s, despite\ntheir shared emphasis on communication; in addition, Pineau\u2019s\nmodel retains an overall consent standard whereas Anderson abandons\nthat standard.) Unless and until a relational context has been\nestablished that enables partners to interpret reliably each\nother\u2019s nonverbal behavior, the negotiation must be verbal. The\nnegotiation model is gender-neutral, requiring that any person who\ninitiates sexual penetration consult verbally with his or her partner\n(of either gender) to come to a mutual understanding of whether both\nparties want penetration to occur. Such communication, Anderson\nobserves, \u201cexpresses an interest in the other person\u2019s\nperspective \u2026 [and] a willingness to consider the other\nperson\u2019s inclinations and humanity. It expresses that the other\nperson matters\u201d (1423). The negotiation model thus differs at\nleast in spirit from even a version of the Yes Model that requires\nverbal consent, in that it emphasizes mutuality rather than a\none-sided permission-seeking.\n\nMart\u00edn Alcoff, having emphasized that the legal system is not\nalways the best, and certainly not the only, arena for reaching truth\nand understanding regarding rape, also suggests that we \u201cmove\naway from simplistic binary categories\u201d (for instance, rape\nversus not-rape) and embrace the broader, more flexible and capacious\nnotion of sexual violation. \u201cTo violate,\u201d she\nobserves,\u201c is to infringe on someone, to transgress, and it can\nalso mean to rupture or break. Violations can happen with stealth,\nwith manipulation, with soft words and a gentle touch to a child, to\nan employee, or anyone who is significantly vulnerable to the offices\nof others\u201d (2018, 12). Among the benefits of this approach, in\nAlcoff\u2019s view, is to make room for the complex experiences of\nsurvivors, who often struggle and/or evolve over time in developing\nand articulating their interpretations of what was done to them. \n\nLegal theorist Jane Kim has argued that \u201crape tolerance\u201d\nin the United States\u2014evidenced by low rates of arrest,\nprosecution, and conviction of rapists at the state\nlevel\u2014indicates a need for new legal approaches (2012, 273). In\nher view, \u201crape should be considered a form of slavery\nprohibited by the Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution, allowing\nfor the creation of a federal criminal regime to prosecute and\nprioritize rape in conjunction with state regimes\u201d (266). She\nargues that the Thirteenth Amendment was intended to prohibit slavery\nand involuntary servitude in all of its forms, and that neither the\nbrief duration of many rapes nor concerns about a \u201cslippery\nslope\u201d warrant excluding rape from its purview. \u201cIn order\nto construct and prosecute rape in a manner consistent with its\npurported gravity,\u201d Kim contends, \u201crape must be\neffectively prosecuted, prohibited, protected against, and abolished\nunder the Thirteenth Amendment\u201d (267).\n\nIt bears noting that successful rape prosecutions depend not only on\nhow rape is legally defined but, at least equally importantly, on the\ngeneral public\u2019s willingness to believe women\u2019s testimony\n(rather than seeing them as lying or confused) and to recognize\nparticular encounters as instances of the applicable legal definition\n(that is, to see this behavior as force, or this\nutterance as expressing nonconsent). Also posing a challenge to\nsuccessful prosecution is what Estrich calls the \u201cassumption of\nrisk approach to culpability\u201d: the common belief that, as she\nputs it, \u201cwomen who put themselves in compromising positions\nshouldn\u2019t complain when they are compromised\u201d (1992, 10).\nThe continuing prevalence of such rape-supportive beliefs can render\neven well-intentioned prosecutors unwilling to pursue legitimate\ncases, given the likelihood that juries will refuse to convict.\n",
