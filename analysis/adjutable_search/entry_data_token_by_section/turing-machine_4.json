    "main_text": "Computing with Turing Machines\n2. Computing with Turing Machines\n\nAs explained in\n Sec. 1.1,\n Turing machines were originally intended to formalize the notion of\ncomputability in order to tackle a fundamental problem of mathematics.\nIndependently of Turing, Alonzo Church gave a different but logically\nequivalent formulation (see\n Sec. 4).\n Today, most computer scientists agree that Turing\u2019s, or any\nother logically equivalent, formal notion captures all\ncomputable problems, viz. for any computable problem, there is a\nTuring machine which computes it. This is known as the\nChurch-Turing thesis, Turing\u2019s thesis (when\nthe reference is only to Turing\u2019s work) or Church\u2019s\nthesis (when the reference is only to Church\u2019s work).\n\nIt implies that, if accepted, any problem not computable by a Turing\nmachine is not computable by any finite means whatsoever. Indeed,\nsince it was Turing\u2019s ambition to capture \u201c[all] the\npossible processes which can be carried out in computing a\nnumber\u201d (Turing 1936\u20137: 249), it follows that, if we\naccept Turing\u2019s analysis:\n\nAny problem not computable by a Turing machine is not\n\u201ccomputable\u201d in the absolute sense (at least, absolute\nrelative to humans, see\n Section 3).\nFor any problem that we believe is computable, we should be able\nto construct a Turing machine which computes it. To put it in\nTuring\u2019s wording:\n\n\nIt is my contention that [the] operations [of a computing machine]\ninclude all those which are used in the computation of a number.\n(Turing 1936\u20137: 231)\n \n\n\nIn this section, examples will be given which illustrate the\ncomputational power and boundaries of the Turing machine\nmodel. Section 3 then discusses some philosophical issues related to\nTuring\u2019s thesis.\n",
