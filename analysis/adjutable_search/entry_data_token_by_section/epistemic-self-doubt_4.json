Calibration and Higher-Order Objective Probability\n\nAnother approach to self-doubt explains the authority that\nsecond-order evidence sometimes has over one\u2019s first-order\nbeliefs by means of the idea that such evidence provides information\nabout the relation of one\u2019s first-order beliefs to the way the\nworld is which one is obligated to take into account. That is,\nevidence like the altitude reading, sleep-deprivation, and empirical\nstudies of the unreliability of eyewitness testimony, provides\ninformation about whether your beliefs are reliable indicators of the\ntruth. We take the reading of a thermometer no more seriously than we\nregard the instrument as reliable. Our beliefs can be viewed as\nreadings of the world and treated the same way (Roush 2009; White\n2009; Sliwa & Horowitz 2015).\n",
