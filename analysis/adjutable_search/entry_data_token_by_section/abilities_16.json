    "main_text": "New approaches to ability || Abilities as distinctive powers\n5.2 Abilities as distinctive powers\n\nAs noted in Section 1.1, dispositions are simply one member of the\nbroader family of powers, albeit one that has figured prominently in\nrecent metaphysics. An alternative account of abilities might give an\naccount of abilities in terms of some other kind of power, perhaps one\nbetter-suited to the distinctive aspects of abilities.\n\nOne account of this kind is developed in a series of works by Barbara\nVetter (especially Vetter 2015). Vetter proposes that our basic modal\nnotion should be potentiality. On a traditional view (which\nVetter rejects) dispositions involve a dyadic relation between a\nstimulus and a manifestation (for example: a glass is disposed to\nbreak when struck). In contrast, potentials involve a monadic relation\nto a manifestation (for example: a glass has the potential to break).\nThis makes potentials especially well-suited to give an account of\nabilities, which also appear to involve a monadic relation to an act,\nnamely the act denoted by the complement of an ability-ascription (for\nexample: I am able to play tennis). To have an ability, Vetter argues,\nis simply to have a certain kind of potentiality. Vetter also provides\nan explicit semantics for agentive modality in terms of the ascription\nof potentiality (Vetter 2013), which constitutes a systematic\nalternative to (MA).\n\nYet another view is suggested by recent work by Helen Steward\nemphasizing the traditional idea of a \u2018two-way power\u2019\n(Steward 2012, Steward 2020; see also Alvarez 2013). Steward argues\nthat actions are exercises of two-way powers \u2014 \u2018powers\nwhich an agent can exercise or not at a given moment, even holding all\nprior conditions at that moment fixed\u2019 (Steward 2020, 345).\nThese are to be contrasted with one-way powers, which manifest\nwhenever their manifestation conditions are realized, as a fragile\nglass breaks whenever it is struck. Unlike both the new\ndispositionalists on the one hand and Vetter on the other, Steward\nsees a fundamental asymmetry between agents, who are bearers of\ntwo-way powers, and mere objects, who are are bearers only of one-way\npowers. It is natural then to think that what it is to have an ability\nis to have a two-way power of a certain kind, and that a theory of\nability should follow from an account of agency and the two-way\npowers.\n\nWe thus have at least three \u2018power-based\u2019 views of\nabilities: the new dispositionalism, Vetter\u2019s potentiality-based\nview, and Steward\u2019s two-way power-based view. It is instructive\nto consider how these three accounts differ with respect to two larger\nphilosophical projects.\n\nOne is the project of giving an analysis of modal language, including\nability-ascriptions, in terms of possible worlds. The new\ndispositionalist rejects (CA) and (MA) but she is still, in principle,\nsympathetic with that project, insofar as she allows that disposition\nascriptions themselves may be ultimately understood in terms of\nquantification over possible worlds. This kind of view is explicitly\nendorsed, for instance, by Smith (2003). In contrast, Vetter is\nexplicitly opposed to this project, while Steward\u2019s view appears\nneutral on this question.\n\nAnother is the project of arguing that agents\u2019 abilities are, or\nare not, compatible with the possibility of determinism. This is a\nquestion we touched on briefly in Section 5.1. As noted there, the new\ndispositionalists are motivated, in part, by the project of arguing\nfor compatibilism. In contrast, Steward is explicitly concerned to\ndefend incompatibilism. (Vetter appears to be neutral on this\nquestion.) The question of how the analysis of ability bears on the\nfree will debates looms over many of these discussions, and we will\nconfront it directly and at some length below in Section 6.\n",
