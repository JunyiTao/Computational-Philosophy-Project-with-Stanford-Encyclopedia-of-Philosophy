Early Responses to the Paradox\n\nThe significance of Russell\u2019s paradox can be seen once it is\nrealized that, using classical logic, all sentences follow from a\ncontradiction. For example, assuming both \\(P\\) and \\({\\sim}P,\\)\nany arbitrary proposition, \\(Q\\), can be proved as follows: from\n\\(P\\) we obtain \\(P \\vee Q\\) by the rule of\nAddition; then from \\(P \\vee Q\\) and \\({\\sim}P\\) we\nobtain \\(Q\\) by the rule of Disjunctive Syllogism. Because set\ntheory underlies all branches of mathematics, many people began to\nworry that the inconsistency of set theory would mean that no\nmathematical proof could be completely trustworthy. Only by\neliminating Russell\u2019s paradox could mathematics as a whole\nregain its consistency.\n\nRussell\u2019s paradox ultimately stems from the idea that any\ncondition or property may be used to determine a set. For example, the\nproperty of being evenly divisible by only itself and the number one\ndistinguishes the set of prime numbers from the set of whole numbers.\nThe property of having mammary glands distinguishes the set of mammals\nfrom reptiles, birds and other living organisms. The property of being\nboth square and not square (or any other conjunction of contradictory\nproperties) determines the empty set, and so on.\n\nOne early skeptic concerning an unrestricted Comprehension (or\nAbstraction) axiom was the originator of modern set theory, Georg\nCantor. Even prior to Russell\u2019s discovery, Cantor had rejected\nunrestricted Comprehension in favour of what was, in effect, a\ndistinction between sets and classes, recognizing that some properties\n(such as the property of being an ordinal) produced collections that\nwere simply too large to be sets, and that any assumption to the\ncontrary would lead to inconsistency. (Details can be found in Moore\n(1982), Hallett (1984) and Menzel (1984).) \n\nRussell\u2019s own response to the paradox came with his aptly named\n theory of types.\n Believing that self-application lay at the heart of the paradox,\nRussell\u2019s basic idea was that we can avoid commitment to\n\\(R\\) (the set of all sets that are not members of themselves) by\narranging all sentences (or, more precisely, all\n propositional functions,\n functions which give propositions as their values) into a hierarchy.\nIt is then possible to refer to all objects for which a given\ncondition (or predicate) holds only if they are all at the same level\nor of the same \u201ctype.\u201d \n\nThis solution to Russell\u2019s paradox is motivated in large part by\nadoption of the so-called vicious circle principle. The\nprinciple in effect states that no propositional function can be\ndefined prior to specifying the function\u2019s scope of application.\nIn other words, before a function can be defined, one must first\nspecify exactly those objects to which the function will apply (the\nfunction\u2019s domain). For example, before defining the predicate\n\u201cis a prime number,\u201d one first needs to define the\ncollection of objects that might possibly satisfy this predicate,\nnamely the set, \\(N\\), of natural numbers.\n\nAs Whitehead and Russell explain,\n\n\nAn analysis of the paradoxes to be avoided shows that they all result\nfrom a kind of vicious circle. The vicious circles in question arise\nfrom supposing that a collection of objects may contain members which\ncan only be defined by means of the collection as a whole. Thus, for\nexample, the collection of propositions will be supposed to\ncontain a proposition stating that \u201call propositions are either\ntrue or false.\u201d It would seem, however, that such a statement\ncould not be legitimate unless \u201call propositions\u201d referred\nto some already definite collection, which it cannot do if new\npropositions are created by statements about \u201call\npropositions.\u201d We shall, therefore, have to say that statements\nabout \u201call propositions\u201d are meaningless. \u2026 The\nprinciple which enables us to avoid illegitimate totalities may be\nstated as follows: \u201cWhatever involves all of a\ncollection must not be one of the collection\u201d; or, conversely:\n\u201cIf, provided a certain collection had a total, it would have\nmembers only definable in terms of that total, then the said\ncollection has no total.\u201d We shall call this the\n\u201cvicious-circle principle,\u201d because it enables us to avoid\nthe vicious circles involved in the assumption of illegitimate\ntotalities. (1910, 2nd edn 37)\n\n\nIf Whitehead and Russell are right, it follows that no\nfunction\u2019s scope of application will ever be able to include any\nobject presupposing the function itself. As a result, propositional\nfunctions (along with their corresponding propositions) will end up\nbeing arranged in a hierarchy of the kind Russell proposes.\n\nAlthough Russell first introduced his theory of types in his 1903\nPrinciples of Mathematics, he recognized immediately that\nmore work needed to be done since his initial account seemed to\nresolve some but not all of the paradoxes. Among the alternatives he\nconsidered was a so-called substitutional theory (Galaugher 2013).\nThis in turn led to type theory\u2019s more mature expression five\nyears later in Russell\u2019s 1908 article, \u201cMathematical Logic\nas Based on the Theory of Types,\u201d and in the monumental work he\nco-authored with\n Alfred North Whitehead,\n Principia Mathematica (1910, 1912, 1913). Russell\u2019s type theory thus\nappears in two versions: the \u201csimple theory\u201d of 1903 and\nthe \u201cramified theory\u201d of 1908. Both versions have been\ncriticized for being too ad hoc to eliminate the paradox successfully.\n\n\nIn response to Russell\u2019s paradox,\n David Hilbert\n also expanded his program of building a consistent, axiomatic\nfoundation for mathematics so that it included an axiomatic foundation\nfor logic and set theory (Peckhaus 2004). Underlying this\nformalist approach was the idea of allowing the use of only\nfinite, well-defined and constructible objects, together with rules of\ninference deemed to be absolutely certain.\n\nFinally,\n Luitzen Brouwer\n developed intuitionism, whose basic idea was that one cannot\nassert the existence of a mathematical object unless one can define a\nprocedure for constructing it.\n\nTogether, all of these responses helped focus attention on the\nconnections between logic, language and mathematics. They also helped\nlogicians develop an explicit awareness of the nature of formal\nsystems and of the kinds of metalogical and metamathematical results\nthat have proved to be central to research in the foundations of logic\nand mathematics over the past one hundred years.\n",
