    "main_text": "Overview of the Dialogue\n1. Overview of the Dialogue\n\n\nPlato\u2019s Parmenides consists in a critical examination\nof the theory of forms, a set of metaphysical and epistemological\ndoctrines articulated and defended by the character Socrates in the\ndialogues of Plato\u2019s middle period (principally Phaedo,\nRepublic II\u2013X, Symposium). According to this\ntheory, there is a single, eternal, unchanging, indivisible, and\nnon-sensible form corresponding to every predicate or property.\nThe theoretical function of these forms is to explain why things\n(particularly, sensible things) have the properties they do.\nThus, it is by virtue of being in some way related to (i.e., by\nparticipating in, or partaking of) the form of beauty that beautiful\nthings (other than beauty) are beautiful, it is by virtue of partaking\nof the form of largeness that large things are large, and so on.\nFundamental to this theory is the claim that forms are separate from\n(at least in the sense of being not identical to) the things that\npartake of them.\n\n\nIn the metaphysics of his middle period, Plato does not provide a\ntheory of the nature of the partaking relation. But in the\nParmenides, Plato considers two accounts of the partaking\nrelation. According to the first \u201cPie Model\u201d account,\nfor X to partake of Y is for the whole or a part\nof Y to be in X (as a part of X). According\nto the second \u201cParadigmatistic\u201d account, for X to\npartake of Y is for X to resemble Y. In the\nfirst part of the dialogue, Plato sets out reasons for thinking that,\non either of these accounts of partaking, the theory of forms is\ninternally inconsistent.\n\n\nImmediately following these criticisms, Plato describes a general\nmethod of training designed to save the forms. The method\nconsists of a series of eight Deductions (with an Appendix to the first\ntwo) focusing on consequences that may be derived from positing the\nbeing of a particular form and consequences that may be derived from\npositing the non-being of that form.\n\n\nIn the second part of the dialogue, Plato instantiates this method,\ntaking the form, the one, as his example. Plato shows, in\nparticular, that whether the one is or is not, the one (and also things\nother than the one: the others) have none of a series of pairs\nof contrary properties (whole/divided, in motion/at rest,\nsame/different, like/unlike, equal/unequal, older/younger). Plato\nalso shows that, whether the one is or is not, the one (and also the\nothers) have (or, at least, appear to have) all of these\ncontrary properties.\n",
