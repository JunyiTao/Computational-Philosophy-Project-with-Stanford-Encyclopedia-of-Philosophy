According to the principle of double effect, sometimes it is\npermissible to cause a harm as an unintended and merely foreseen side\neffect (or \u201cdouble effect\u201d) of bringing about a good\nresult even though it would not be permissible to cause such a harm as\na means to bringing about the same good end.\n",
