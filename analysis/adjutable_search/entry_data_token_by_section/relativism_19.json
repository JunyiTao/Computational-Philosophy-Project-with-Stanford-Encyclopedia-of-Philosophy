New Relativism\nThere is a recent version of relativism according to which some of the views considered so far\u2014for instance, Harman\u2019s (1975) variety of moral relativism\u2014will be regarded varieties of contextualism as opposed to bona fide relativism. This recent version\u2014sufficiently distinct from the relativisms so far considered that it is deserving of attention in its own right\u2014we are calling \u201cNew Relativism\u201d, a variety of relativism that has arisen out of work in the philosophy of language in the analytic tradition, and for which the leading proponents have included Max K\u00f6lbel (2003, 2004), Peter Lasersohn (2005), Crispin Wright (2006) and, in particular, John MacFarlane (2005b, 2007, 2014); cf., Marques (2019). In this section we aim to (i) outline several features that individuate New Relativism; (ii) consider in turn motivations for (and objections to) several prominent strands of it; and, finally, (iii) conclude with some philosophical problems that face New Relativism more generally.\n",
