    "main_text": "The Use of Religious Language\n3. The Use of Religious Language\n\nSuppose that religious sentences represent a religious subject matter,\ni.e., that (a*) is true. There remains the further question of what\nspeakers mean when they use religious sentences. The semantic\nor propositional content of a sentence and its truth conditions is one\nthing, the information that a sentence is used to communicate is\nanother. Any philosophical account of religious discourse must allow\nfor non-literal utterances, where the propositional content of the\nutterance and the thought that it is used to communicate appear to\ndiverge. However, according to the face value theory, utterances such\nas (7), (8) and (9) should\u2014unless the context indicates\notherwise\u2014be understood as literal assertions that, if sincerely\nstated by a religious believer, express the speaker\u2019s belief in\nwhat is\n said.[3]\n\n(7)God created the\nworld.\n(8) The authors of the\nBible were inspired by the Holy Spirit.\n(9)God is\nomnipotent.\n\n\nThere are two main types of opposition to (b*). The first is that\nreligious utterances\u2014including utterances of indicative\nsentences that are apparently literal\u2014are not literal assertions\nbut fall under some other standard category of speech act. Speech\nacts\u2014or illocutionary acts in Austin\u2019s (1955\n[1975, 95]) terminology\u2014are what a speaker does in saying\nsomething. Examples include assertions, questions, commands, warnings,\nthreats, statements of intention, requests. So, according to the first\ntype of opposition to (b*) religious utterances, while many of them\nappear to be literal assertions, are in fact some other kind of speech\nact. Proposals include analogy or metaphor\n (3.1),\n praise or prayer\n (3.2),\n and pretence or other kinds of quasi-assertion\n (3.3).\n The second type of opposition to (b*), considered in\n (3.4),\n proposes that religious sentences are used for various\n(non-assertoric) purposes but does not identify a unified speech act\nas characteristic of religious discourse.\n",
