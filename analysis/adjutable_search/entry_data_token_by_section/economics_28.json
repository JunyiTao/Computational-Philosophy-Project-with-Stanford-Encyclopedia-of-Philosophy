Conclusions\n\nThe frontiers between economics and philosophy concerned with\nmethodology, rationality, ethics and normative social and political\nphilosophy are buzzing with activity. This activity is diverse and\nconcerned with very different questions. Although many of these are\nrelated, philosophy of economics is not a single unified enterprise.\nIt is a collection of separate inquiries linked to one another by\nconnections among the questions and by the dominating influence of\nmainstream economic models and techniques.\n",
