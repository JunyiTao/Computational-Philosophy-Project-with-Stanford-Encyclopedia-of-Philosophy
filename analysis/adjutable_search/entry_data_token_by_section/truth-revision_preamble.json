    "main_text": "\n\nConsider the following sentence:\n\n(1)\n(1) is not true.\n\n\nIt has long been known that the sentence, (1), produces a paradox, the\nso-called liar\u2019s paradox: it seems impossible\nconsistently to maintain that (1) is true, and impossible consistently\nto maintain that (1) is not true: if (1) is true, then (1) says,\ntruly, that (1) is not true so that (1) is not true; on the other\nhand, if (1) is not true, then what (1) says is the case, i.e., (1) is\ntrue. (For details, see Section 1, below.) Given such a paradox, one\nmight be sceptical of the notion of truth, or at least of the\nprospects of giving a scientifically respectable account of truth.\n\nAlfred Tarski\u2019s great accomplishment was to show how to give\n\u2014 contra this scepticism \u2014 a formal definition of truth\nfor a wide class of formalized languages. Tarski did not,\nhowever, show how to give a definition of truth for languages (such as\nEnglish) that contain their own truth predicates. He thought\nthat this could not be done, precisely because of the liar\u2019s\nparadox. More generally, Tarski reckoned that any language\nwith its own truth predicate would be inconsistent, as long as it\nobeyed the rules of standard classical logic, and had the ability to\nrefer to its own sentences. As we will see in our remarks on Theorem\n2.1 in Section 2.3, Tarski was not quite right: there are consistent\nclassical interpreted languages that refer to their own sentences and\nhave their own truth predicates. (This point originates in Gupta 1982\nand is strengthened in Gupta and Belnap 1993.)\n\nGiven the close connection between meaning and\ntruth, it is widely held that any semantics for a language\n\\(L\\), i.e., any theory of meaning for \\(L\\), will be closely related\nto a theory of truth for \\(L\\): indeed, it is commonly held that\nsomething like a Tarskian theory of truth for \\(L\\) will be a central\npart of a semantics for \\(L\\). Thus, the impossibility of giving a\nTarskian theory of truth for languages with their own truth predicates\nthreatens the project of giving a semantics for languages with their\nown truth predicates.\n\nWe had to wait until the work of Kripke 1975 and of Martin &\nWoodruff 1975 for a systematic formal proposal of a semantics for\nlanguages with their own truth predicates. The basic thought is\nsimple: take the offending sentences, such as (1), to be neither\ntrue nor false. Kripke, in particular, shows how to implement\nthis thought for a wide variety of languages, in effect employing a\nsemantics with three values, true, false and\n neither.[1]\n It is safe to say that Kripkean approaches have replaced Tarskian\npessimism as the new orthodoxy concerning languages with their own\ntruth predicates.\n\nOne of the main rivals to the three-valued semantics is the Revision\nTheory of Truth, or RTT, independently conceived by Hans Herzberger\nand Anil Gupta, and first presented in publication in Herzberger 1982a\nand 1982b, Gupta 1982 and Belnap 1982 \u2014 the first monographs on\nthe topic are Yaq\u016bb 1993 and the locus classicus, Gupta\n& Belnap 1993. The RTT is designed to model the kind of reasoning\nthat the liar sentence leads to, within a two-valued context.\n(See Section 5.2 on the question of whether the RTT is genuinely\ntwo-valued.) The central idea is the idea of a revision\nprocess: a process by which we revise hypotheses about\nthe truth-value of one or more sentences. The present article\u2019s\npurpose is to outline the Revision Theory of Truth. We proceed as\nfollows:\n",
