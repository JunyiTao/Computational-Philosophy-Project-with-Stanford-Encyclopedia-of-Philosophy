    "main_text": "Chemical Reduction\n6. Chemical Reduction\n\nOne of the perennial topics in philosophy of science concerns\ninter-theoretic relations. In the course of debating whether biology\nis reducible to the physical sciences or whether psychology is\nreducible to biology, many philosophers assume that chemistry has\nalready been reduced to physics. In the past, this assumption was so\npervasive that it was common to read about\n\u201cphysico/chemical\u201d laws and explanations, as if the\nreduction of chemistry to physics was complete. Although most\nphilosophers of chemistry would accept that there is no conflict\nbetween the sciences of chemistry and physics (Needham 2010b), many\nwould reject a stronger unity thesis. Most believe that chemistry has\nnot been reduced to physics nor is it likely to be (see Le Poidevin\n2005, for the opposite view, and Hendry & Needham 2007, for a\nrejoinder).\n\nWhen thinking about the question of reducibility in chemistry, it is\nuseful to break this question into two parts: The first, and more\nfamiliar one to philosophers, concerns the relationship between\nelements, atoms, molecules, and the fundamental particles of physics.\nWe might ask, \u201cAre atomic and molecular species reducible to\nsystems of fundamental particles interacting according to quantum\nmechanics?\u201d A second, less familiar question concerns the\nrelationship between the macroscopic and microscopic descriptions of\nchemical substances. \u201cAre chemical substances reducible to\nmolecular species?\u201d Here, the main question is whether all\nchemical properties that have been defined macroscopically can be\nredefined in terms of the properties of atoms, molecules, and their\ninteractions.\n",
