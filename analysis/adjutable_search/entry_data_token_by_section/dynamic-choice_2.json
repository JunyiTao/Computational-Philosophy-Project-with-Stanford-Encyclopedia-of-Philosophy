    "main_text": "Challenging Choice Situations, Problematic Preference Structures, and Dynamic Choice Problems || Time-Biased Preferences\n1.2 Time-Biased Preferences\n\nAnother source of dynamic choice problems is present-biased\npreferences.\n\nLike other animals, humans give more weight to present satisfaction\nthan to future satisfaction. In other words, we discount future\nutility. Insofar as one discounts future utility, one prefers, other\nthings equal, to get a reward sooner rather than later; relatedly, the\ncloser one gets to a future reward, the more the reward is valued. If\nwe map the value (to a particular agent) of a given future reward as a\nfunction of time, we get a discount curve, such as in Figure 1:\n\n\n\nFigure 1. The discounted value of a\nreward gradually increases as t, the time at which the reward\nwill be available, approaches.\n\n\nResearch in experimental psychology (see, for example, Kirby &\nHerrnstein 1995, Millar & Navarick 1984, Solnick et al. 1980, and\nAinslie 2001) suggests that, given how animals, including humans,\ndiscount future utility, there are plenty of cases in which the\ndiscount curves from two rewards, one a small reward and the other a\nlarger later reward, cross, as in Figure 2:\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Two crossing discount curves,\none tracking the discounted value of a small reward that will be\navailable at t1 and the other tracking the\ndiscounted value of a large reward that will be available at\nt2.\n\n\nIn such cases, the agent\u2019s discounting of future utility induces\na preference reversal with respect to the two possible rewards. When\nneither reward is imminent, before the discount curves cross, the\nagent consistently prefers the larger later reward over the smaller\nearlier reward. But when the opportunity to accept the small reward is\nsufficiently close, the discounted value of the small reward catches\nup with and then overtakes the discounted value of the larger later\nreward. As the discount curves cross, the agent\u2019s preferences\nreverse and she prefers the small reward over the larger later\nreward.\n\nDiscounting-induced preference reversals make consistent and efficient\nchoice over time a challenge. An agent subject to discounting-induced\npreference reversals can easily find herself performing a series of\nactions she planned against and will soon regret. Consider the agent\nwho wants to save for a decent retirement but, as each opportunity to\nsave approaches, prefers to spend her potential retirement\ncontribution on just one more trivial indulgence before finally\ntightening her belt for the sake of the future satisfaction she feels\nis essential to her well-being. Though this agent consistently plans\nto save for her retirement, her plans can be consistently thwarted by\nher discounting-induced preference reversals. Her life may thus end up\nlooking very different from the sort of life she wanted.\n\nInterestingly, in addition to giving more weight to present\nsatisfaction than to future satisfaction, human beings also seem to\ngive more weight to future satisfaction than to past satisfaction.\nRelatedly, human beings seem to discount past pain more than future\npain. Suppose, to appeal to a variation on Derek Parfit\u2019s famous\nthought experiment (1984, 165\u20136), your situation is such that\neither you\u2019ve already suffered a perfectly safe but terribly\npainful ten-hour medical procedure yesterday or else you will suffer a\nperfectly safe but terribly painful nine-hour medical procedure\ntomorrow. (You don\u2019t know which situation you\u2019re in\nbecause amnesia is administered right after the procedure and\nyou\u2019ve just woken up in the hospital confused about whether\nyou\u2019re recovering from the procedure or being prepped for it.)\nWouldn\u2019t you prefer to be in the former situation? Intuitively,\nit seems like the prevailing and rational response would be\n\u201cmost definitely!\u201d But there is some concern that this\nform of future bias, in which past rewards or costs are discounted\nmore than future rewards or costs, can lead to trouble (Dougherty\n2011; Greene and Sullivan 2015). For example, Preston Greene and\nMeghan Sullivan (2015) argue that it can be a recipe for a life of\n\u201cmeager returns\u201d and/or regret. Their reasoning is quite\nelaborate, but the following simple illustration and somewhat\nextemporized analysis, will hopefully provide a glimpse into some of\nthe interesting philosophical issues at stake. Consider Massimo, who\nthoroughly enjoys massages and who can choose between a longer massage\nearly on or a shorter massage later. If Massimo is future biased,\nthen, with some variation on the length and timing of the massages, he\ncan easily find himself faced with the following dilemma: if he opts\nfor getting a longer massage early on, he will, sometime after getting\nthe longer massage and before the shorter massage would have been\navailable, regret accepting a pleasure, now past, that could have\nstill been in the future (even if diminished); if, alternatively, he\nopts for getting a shorter massage later on (thus avoiding regret of\nthe preceding sort), he will face a life of \u201cmeager\nreturns,\u201d in which less pleasure later is, potentially\nroutinely, chosen over more pleasure earlier (a scenario that can\nitself generate regret and/or concern, particularly once both massage\ntimes are past, or if one recognizes, even as one is gladly awaiting a\nlesser pleasure after giving up a greater pleasure that would now have\nbeen in the past, that, insofar as the same sort of choice has arisen\nrepeatedly and will continue to arise repeatedly, repeated choices for\nless pleasure later make for a life that is both retrospectively and\nprospectively much less appealing than repeated choices for more\npleasure early on).\n",
