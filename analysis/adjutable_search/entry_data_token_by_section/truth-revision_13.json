    "main_text": "Further issues || Applications\n5.6 Applications\n\nGiven Gupta and Belnap\u2019s general revision-theoretic treatment of\ncircular definitions \u2014 of which their treatment of\ntruth is a special case \u2014 one would expect\nrevision-theoretic ideas to be applied to other concepts. Antonelli\n1994b applies these ideas to non-well-founded sets: a non-well-founded\nset \\(X\\) can be thought of as circular, since, for some \\(X_0 ,\n\\ldots ,X_n\\) we have \\(X \\in X_0 \\in \\ldots \\in X_n \\in X\\). Chapuis\n2003 applies revision-theoretic ideas to rational decision making.\nThis connection is further developed by Bruni 2015 and by Bruni and\nSillari 2018. For a discussion of revision theory and abstract objects\nsee Wang 2011. For a discussion of revision theory and vagueness, see\nAsmus 2013.\n\nStandefer (2015a) studies the connection between the circular\ndefinitions of revision theory and a particular modal logic RT (for\n\u201cRevision Theory\u201d). Campbell-Moore et al. 2019\nand Campbell-Moore 2021 use revision sequences to model probabilities\nand credences, respectively. Cook 2019 employs a revision-theoretic\nanalysis to find a new possible solution of Benardete\u2019s version\nof the Zeno paradox.\n\nIn recent times, there has been increasing interest in bridging the\ngap between classic debates on the nature of truth \u2014\ndeflationism, the correspondence theory, minimalism, pragmatism, and\nso on \u2014 and formal work on truth, motivated by the liar\u2019s\nparadox. The RTT is tied to pro-sententialism by Belnap 2006;\ndeflationism, by Yaq\u016bb 2008; and minimalism, by Restall 2005.\n\nWe must also mention Gupta 2006. In this work, Gupta argues that an\nexperience provides the experiencer, not with a straightforward\nentitlement to a proposition, but rather with a hypothetical\nentitlement: as explicated in Berker 2011, if subject S has experience\n\\(e\\) and is entitled to hold view \\(v\\) (where S\u2019s\nview is the totality of S\u2019s concepts, conceptions, and\nbeliefs), then S is entitled to believe a certain class of perceptual\njudgements, \\(\\Gamma(v)\\). (Berker uses \u201cpropositions\u201d\ninstead of \u201cperceptual judgements\u201d in his formulation.)\nBut this generates a problem: how is S entitled to hold a view? There\nseems to be a circular interdependence between entitlements to views\nand entitlements to perceptual judgements. Here, Gupta appeals to a\ngeneral form of revision theory \u2014 generalizing beyond both the\nrevision theory of truth and the revision theory of circularly defined\nconcepts (Section 5.4, above) \u2014 to given an account of how\n\u201chypothetical perceptual entitlements could yield categorical\nentitlements\u201d (Berker 2011).\n5.7 An open question\n\nWe close with an open question about \\(\\mathbf{T}^*\\) and\n\\(\\mathbf{T}^{\\#}\\). Recall Definition 3.11, above, which defines when\na sentence \\(A\\) of a truth language \\(L\\) is valid in the ground\nmodel \\(M\\) by \\(\\mathbf{T}^*\\) or by\n\\(\\mathbf{T}^{\\#}\\). We will say that \\(A\\) is valid by\n\\(\\mathbf{T}^*\\) [alternatively, by \\(\\mathbf{T}^{\\#}\\)] iff\n\\(A\\) is valid in the ground model \\(M\\) by \\(\\mathbf{T}^*\\)\n[alternatively, by \\(\\mathbf{T}^{\\#}\\)] for every ground model \\(M\\).\nOur open question is this: What is the complexity of the set of\nsentences valid by \\(\\mathbf{T}^* [\\mathbf{T}^{\\#}\\)]?",
