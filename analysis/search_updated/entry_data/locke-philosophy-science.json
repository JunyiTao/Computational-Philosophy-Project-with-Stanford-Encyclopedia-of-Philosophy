    "preamble": "\n\nJohn Locke has been widely hailed for providing an epistemological\nfoundation for the experimental science of his day, articulating the\nnew, probabilistic form of knowledge appropriate to it. Yet, while he\nis in important respects a devotee of that new science, there are also\nsignificant tensions in his thought. He stands behind its experimental\nmethods as he targets the earlier, speculative or rationalist\nphilosophies for relying on methodologies and epistemological\nexpectations unsuited to natural philosophy. He also frequently\nappears to embrace the new science\u2019s corpuscular hypothesis,\nwhose powers and minute particles figure prominently in his attempt to\nunderstand why we cannot hope for demonstrative certainty about\nnatural phenomena. Still, the new science\u2019s methodology was\nevolving. Just how far did Locke travel with that evolution, and what\naspects of his thought prevented him from going further? As for the\ncorpuscular hypothesis, what exactly was his stance toward it? He\nfrequently speaks of particles and powers as if they belonged to\nestablished knowledge, and yet in explaining the hypothesis\u2019s\nflaws, he seems to consider them fatal.

    "main_text": "\n1. Introduction\n\nTwo features of Locke\u2019s intellectual landscape are most salient\nfor understanding his philosophy of science, one of which concerns the\nnew science\u2019s methodology, and the other its content. First,\nthen, is the new methodological approach to understanding the natural\nworld. This approach is accompanied by profound shifts in disciplinary\nboundaries and in conceptions of induction and scientific knowledge.\nLocke\u2019s reaction is mostly progressive. Impressed by\nexperimental methods and cognizant of their poor fit with the\nAristotelian ideal, he defines a distinct kind of knowledge, one\ninferior to genuine scientific knowledge but appropriate to human\nsensory capacities. In so doing, he develops an epistemological basis\nfor the new, experimental philosophy. Yet his reaction also has its\nconservative aspect, one that some see as having limited him in the\nface of the new science\u2019s evolving methodology. He retains an\nideal notion of scientific knowledge as demonstrative and certain, and\nwhile the speculative systems of the Aristotelians and the Cartesians.\nare the two main targets of his Essay, he shares that ideal\nwith them.\n\nThe second salient feature is the dominant scientific theory of\nLocke\u2019s day: the new science\u2019s corpuscular hypothesis. As\ndefined for the purposes of this article, the corpuscular hypothesis\n(i) takes observable bodies to be composed of material particles or\ncorpuscles, (ii) takes impulse (action by surface impact) to be either\nthe primary or sole means of communicating motion, and (iii) attempts\nto reduce colour and other qualities at the level of observable bodies\nto the primary or inherent properties of the particles composing those\nbodies. In what may be called its orthodox version (\u201cpure\nmechanism,\u201d as Ayers (1981, p. 212) calls it) the corpuscular\nhypothesis restricts those inherent properties to size, shape, number,\nand motion, and holds that all other qualities and operations are\nexplicable in terms of that restricted set of properties. The orthodox\nversion thus implies a proviso of contact action\u2014that\nbodies causally interact only locally, by impact, such that unmediated\naction at a distance is deemed impossible. (Although a number of\ncommentators use the terms \u2018corpuscular hypothesis\u2019 and\n\u2018mechanism\u2019 interchangeably, distinguishing them has\ncertain benefits. For instance, it permits us to classify Isaac Newton\namong the corpuscularian theoristis without engaging the debate about\nwhether he adhered to the contact action proviso. The definitions\ngiven here also agree largely with those in the entry on\n John Locke.)\n Plenist and atomist versions of the corpuscular hypothesis may be\ndistinguished. Plenist theorists deny the void and assert a plenum of\nmatter, as Descartes does by identifying matter with extension, and\nthough these theorists speak of particles, their particles are not\natoms, being infinitely or at least indefinitely divisible. Atomist\ntheorists, by contrast, accept the void and take the particles or\ncorpuscles comprising compound bodies to be indivisible, or at least\nprobably so. Since Locke\u2019s sympathies clearly lie with the\natomist version, the term \u2018corpuscular hypothesis\u2019 shall\nrefer to that variant throughout this article unless indicated\notherwise. Locke develops central theses of the Essay in\nclose conjunction with the corpuscular hypothesis. The most notable of\nthese is the distinction between real and nominal essences, the former\ndenoting a substance\u2019s internal constitution and the latter\ndenoting the observable properties we use to name or categorize it.\nAlthough Locke develops that distinction in connection with the\nprimary-secondary quality distinction associated with corpuscular\ntheorists, including his mentor, Robert Boyle, it does not follow that\nthe two distinctions are interchangeable. Locke often treats the\nhypothesis with skepticism, and its status and purpose are a source of\ncontroversy.\n\nThis article examines questions connected with the two salient\nfeatures noted, and in connection with the first, it also examines\nLocke\u2019s relationship to Newton, a figure instrumental to the\nchanging conceptions of scientific knowledge. Section 2 addresses\nquestions connected to those conceptions. What does Locke take science\n(scientia) or scientific knowledge to be generally, why does\nhe think that scientia in natural philosophy is beyond the\nreach of human beings, and what characterizes the conception of human\nknowledge that he develops for natural philosophy? Section 3 addresses\nthe question provoked by Locke\u2019s apparently conflicting\ntreatments of the corpuscular hypothesis. Does he accept or defend the\ncorpuscular hypothesis? If not, what is its role in his thought, and\nwhat explains its close connection to key theses of the\nEssay? Since a scholarly debate has arisen about the status\nof the corpuscular hypothesis for Locke, Section 3 reviews some main\npositions in that debate. Section 4 considers the relationship between\nLocke\u2019s thought and Newton\u2019s. All citations of An\nEssay Concerning Human Understanding are indicated by\n\u2018E\u2019, followed by the book and section numbers. Page\nnumbers referring to the Nidditch edition are also provided.\n2. Locke on knowledge in natural philosophy: Scientia and human knowledge\n\nLocke\u2019s great epistemological contribution to philosophy is a\nconception of human knowledge suitable for the experimental science of\nhis day, one that in natural philosophy will replace the old,\nAristotelian conception. According to the Aristotelian conception,\nscientific knowledge\u2014scientia\u2014is certain\nknowledge of necessary truths, which can be expressed in syllogistic\nform, the conclusion following from self-evident premises. In the\ndomain of natural philosophy, it is certain knowledge of real\nessences. Although Locke does not seriously entertain a radical\nskepticism\u2014finding \u201ca very manifest difference between\ndreaming of being in the Fire, and being actually in it\u201d (E\nIV.ii.14, pp.537\u2013538)\u2014he recognizes that the demands of\nscientia are too stringent for the new, experimental science.\nNevertheless, the concept of scientia plays an important role\nas he develops his conception of the probabilistic sort of knowledge\nthat is possible for humans in the domain of natural philosophy: it\nserves as a foil as he explains why humans must settle for\nprobabilistic knowledge in natural philosophy, where scientia\nwill always remain out of reach. Scientia can serve as a foil\nbecause it is attainable for human beings in certain domains; however\nLocke thinks that for nobler spirits, notably angels, it is also\nattainable within natural philosophy.\n\nThis section begins by reviewing the history of the concept of\nscientia and the factors that prevent human beings from\nattaining it in natural philosophy, which impel Locke to develop an\nalternative conception of human knowledge there. This section also\nexplains what Locke thinks scientia in natural philosophy\nwould amount to and the lesser human knowledge that must serve us in\nits place.\n2.1 Historical roots of scientia\n\nThe conception of genuine scientific knowledge that Locke inherits and\nto some extent retains, scientia, has its roots in Aristotle,\nspecifically in the beginning of Book I, \u00a72 of the Posterior\n Analytics.[1]\n For Aristotle, scientific knowledge can have only necessary truths as\nits objects and requires a knowledge of causes. Accordingly,\nscientific knowledge of a fact requires knowing its necessity by\nknowing its necessary relations to its causes. Although there are\nmanifold causes, the main one at issue here is the formal\ncause\u2014the nature or essence\u2014as Aristotle indicates\n elsewhere.[2]\n\nWe suppose ourselves to possess unqualified scientific knowledge of a\nthing, as opposed to knowing it in the accidental way in which the\nsophist knows, when we think that we know the cause on which the fact\ndepends, as the cause of that fact and of no other, and, further, that\nthe fact could not be other than it is\u2026.The proper object of\nunqualified scientific knowledge is something which cannot be other\nthan it is (Aristotle, Posterior Analytics, I.2).\n\n\nThe knower\u2019s epistemic stance toward a necessary truth and its\nrelation to causes is one of certainty. The certain fact is\ndemonstrable via a syllogism in which the premises are self-evident,\nrequiring no demonstration themselves.\n\nWe do know by demonstration. By demonstration I mean a syllogism\nproductive of scientific knowledge, a syllogism\u2026.The premisses\nmust be primary and indemonstrable; otherwise they will require\ndemonstration in order to be known, since to have knowledge, if it be\nnot accidental knowledge, of things which are demonstrable, means\nprecisely to have a demonstration of them. The premisses must be the\ncauses of the conclusion, better known than it, and prior to it; its\ncauses, since we possess scientific knowledge of a thing only when we\nknow its cause; prior, in order to be causes; antecedently known, this\nantecedent knowledge being not our mere understanding of the meaning,\nbut knowledge of the fact as well (Aristotle, Posterior\nAnalytics, I.2).\n\n\nThe stipulation that the premises of a scientific demonstration must\nbe indemonstrable, that is, self-evident, leads to a prima\nfacie difficulty. This conception of scientific knowledge is\nintended to encompass not only conceptual propositions, but also\npropositions about the real natures or essences of substances, which\nare propositions about the world. As with any other demonstration, a\ndemonstration in natural philosophy must have premises that are\nself-evident, since otherwise a regress would ensue. Propositions\nabout the world are experience-based, however, and therefore, it is\nnot clear how a demonstration\u2019s premises could be\nself-evident.\n\nIt would be overstating matters to say that this problem appears only\nfrom a contemporary perspective; there was some recognition of it in\nthe ancient and medieval\n periods.[3]\n Still, before the advent of the experimental science, the problem was\nnot strongly felt because experience was understood in a different\nway. For one thing, the notion of an experiment\u2014an artificially\nconstructed, single event or series of events designed to test for a\npredicted outcome\u2014did not exist. Moreover, among the scholastic\nAristotelians, a single, naturally occurring event could not by itself\nbe regarded as revealing of natural processes; such an event could be\na \u201cmonster,\u201d that is, an event that conflicts with nature\nrather than having been produced by\n it.[4]\n Events as generally experienced, however, were regarded as being\nrevealing of nature and consequently, they could provide the universal\ntruths needed as premises in the\n syllogism.[5]\n How was the gap between events as usually experienced\u2014which\nstill amounts to a limited sample of evidence\u2014and the universal\nclaim derived from them bridged? It is only from the modern and\ncontemporary perspectives that such a gap exists to be bridged. For\nAristotle and medieval thinkers, human faculties are so constituted as\nto be able to apprehend nature, that is, to discern the essences of\n substances.[6]\n In short, then, because the internal essences that form the content\nof natural philosophy are real, and because our faculties are\nconstituted to apprehend those real essences, natural philosophy can\nbe a science; it is a domain in which certain, demonstrative knowledge\ncan be had, despite its dependence upon experience.\n\nThe exemplars of scientific knowledge, to be sure, are conceptual\ndisciplines, not only geometry, but also rational theology, the latter\nbeing the quintessential science for the\n medievals.[7]\n Yet for the most part, natural philosophy stands side by side with\nconceptual disciplines, even into the modern period. Bacon, though\nassociated with induction, accepts the demonstrative conception of\nscientific knowledge, and so does Galileo, who uses experiments to\nreveal fundamental principles (though also using them in other\n ways).[8]\n As empirical methods are refined and more widely applied, however,\nthe belief that natural philosophy can stand under the umbrella of\nscientia comes under increasing\n pressure.[9]\n Some thinkers resist the pressure, most notably Descartes, who\nderives his laws of nature by an a priori reflection upon God\u2019s\nnature, and, placing his confidence in these rationalist methods,\ndenies that his third law of nature is undermined when observations of\ncolliding bodies conflict with\n it.[10]\n Yet for the experimentalists themselves, including Locke\u2019s\nmentor, Boyle, observations and experiments are the primary route to\nknowledge. (It should be noted, however, that most advocates of\nexperimentalism did not consider speculation wholly illegitimate,\ninstead insisting that it be delayed until considerable experimental\nand observational evidence had been amassed; see Anstey (2011, pp.\n4,5).) It is this approach that puts natural philosophy on the path to\nHume\u2019s problem of induction and most influences\n Locke.[11]\n2.2 Scientia in natural philosophy and obstacles to human attainment\n\nAs indicated earlier, scientia serves as the backdrop against\nwhich Locke develops the conception of the type of knowledge that is\nhumanly possible in natural philosophy. Having retained the ideal of\nscientia exemplified by geometry while also having\nassimilated the significance of Boyle\u2019s experimental method,\nLocke is driven to his characteristic pessimism about the kind and\nextent of knowledge possible for us in natural philosophy. \u201cThe\nmeanest, and most obvious Things that come in our way, have dark\nsides, that the quickest Sight cannot penetrate into\u201d (E\nIV.iii.22, p. 553). Due to the weakness of our faculties, Locke\nsuspects, \u201cnatural Philosophy is not capable of being made a\nScience\u201d (E IV.xii.10, p. 645). This section considers\nLocke\u2019s general notion of scientia, what would be\nrequired for scientia in natural philosophy, and the\nobstacles that prevent human beings from attaining scientia\nin that domain.\n2.2.1 Scientia in general\n\nLocke takes knowledge generally to consist in \u201cthe perception of\nthe connexion and agreement, or disagreement and repugnancy of any of\nour Ideas\u201d (E IV.i.1\u20132, p. 525), and among the three kinds\nof knowledge that he distinguishes\u2014intuitive, demonstrative, and\nsensitive\u2014the former two are kinds of certain knowledge.\nIntuitive and demonstrative knowledge differ in the number of\nintuitions involved, and consequently, differ in their degree of\ncertainty (E IV.ii.14, pp.537\u2013538). Intuitive knowledge is the\nmost certain because the truth is grasped immediately. There are no\nintermediate steps, and doubt is impossible because the mind can no\nmore avoid recognizing the truth than the open, functioning eye could\navoid seeing light when turned toward the sun (see E IV.ii.1, p. 531).\nDemonstrative knowledge, though also qualifying as certain, is less so\nbecause it involves intermediate steps. We cannot grasp immediately\nthat the three angles of any triangle are equal to two right triangles\nbut must instead construct the steps of a proof. Upon doing so and\ngrasping the connections among the proof\u2019s steps, we have\ndemonstrative knowledge (E IV.ii.2\u20133, p.531\u2013532).\nIntuitive and demonstrative knowledge are forms of scientia,\nthen, which Locke defines as \u201ccertain universal Knowledge\u201d\n(E IV.iii.29, p. 559). Mere \u201cparticular matters of fact\u201d\n(E IV.iii.25, pp. 555\u201356) do not qualify.\n\nTo understand Locke\u2019s notion of scientia, we must\nconsider its objects: real essences and the necessary connections that\nflow from them. According to the Aristotelian view, a single essence\nboth grounds the properties of a thing, making it what it is, and\nprovides the basis for classifying it. Repudiating that view, Locke\ndraws a distinction between real and nominal\n essences.[12]\n Whereas the nominal essence consists of the set of observable\nqualities we use to classify a thing (which implies that the nominal\nessence could vary across time or communities), the real essence (or\nreal or internal constitution, as he sometimes writes) is that which\nmakes a thing what it is.\n\nEssence may be taken for the being of any thing, whereby it is what it\nis. And thus the real internal, but generally in Substances, unknown\nConstitution of Things, whereon their discoverable Qualities depend,\nmay be called their Essence. This is the proper original\nsignification of the Word, as is evident from the formation of it;\nEssentia, in its primary notation signifying properly\nBeing. And in this sense it is still used, when we speak of\nthe Essence of particular things, without giving them any\nName (E III.iii.15, p. 417).\n\n\nDiscussion of real essence often focuses upon the real essences of\nmaterial substances, and in that case we say that the real essence is\nthe causal ground of the substance\u2019s perceivable properties (for\nfurther details and a useful chart, see the entry by Jones,\n\u201cLocke on Real Essence\u201d). As will be discussed in a\nsubsequent section, many commentators interpret Locke as identifying a\nmaterial substance\u2019s real essence with some subset of its\nconstituent corpuscles\u2019 primary qualities, but that\nidentification presums Locke\u2019s acceptance of the corpuscular\nhypothesis (e.g., Osler 1970, p. 12; Mandelbaum 1964, p.1). According\nto another interpretation, the real-nominal essence distinction is\nmetaphysical, and thus more fundamental than the primary-secondary\nquality distinction, which is a physical distinction, belonging as it\ndoes to a particular physical theory, the corpuscular hypothesis. Yet\nleaving that debate aside for the moment, we may note from the first\nsentence of the above-quoted passage that Locke does not restrict the\nnotion of real essence to substances. This means that we can speak of,\nsay, the real essence of a triangle, understanding it as that which\ngrounds the triangle\u2019s qualities, making it what it is.\n\nSince a substance\u2019s qualities flow from its real essence, having\nscientific knowledge of a substance requires knowing both its real\nessence and the necessary connections between that and its other\nqualities. Geometry serves as an exemplar, as it did for so many of\nLocke\u2019s predecessors. In knowing what a triangle is, we cannot\nconceive things being otherwise than that the sum of its three angles\nequals the sum of two right angles.\n\nSuch knowledge is so certain that we cannot conceive even of God\nhaving made things otherwise:\n\nThus the Idea of a right-line Triangle necessarily carries\nwith it an equality of its Angles to two right ones. Nor can we\nconceive this Relation, this connexion of these two Ideas, to\nbe possibly mutable, or to depend on any arbitrary Power, which of\nchoice made it thus, or could make it otherwise (E IV.iii.29, pp.\n559\u2013560).\n\n\nScientia is possible in another conceptual domain also:\nmorality. Morality is characterized by discernible necessary\nconnections, and Locke is adamant that we can have the same level of\ncertainty there as in geometry.\n\nWhere there is no Property, there is no Injustice, is a\nProposition as certain as any Demonstration in Euclid: For\nthe Idea of Property, being a right to any thing;\nand the Idea to which the Name Injustice is given,\nbeing the Invasion or Violation of that right; it is evident,\nthat\u2026I can as certainly know this Proposition to be true, as\nthat a Triangle has three Angles equal to two right ones (E IV.iii.18,\npp. 549\u201350).\n\n2.2.2 Scientia in natural philosophy\n\nWhat would be required for scientia in natural philosophy?\nSince scientia generally concerns real essences, and since\nnatural philosophy for Locke concerns material substances and their\npowers, scientia in natural philosophy would be knowledge of\nmaterial substances\u2019 real essences and their necessary\nconnections to the qualities flowing from them.\n\nIf we could have scientia in natural philosophy, we could\nknow a substance\u2019s qualities without making observations or\nexperiments. To take one of Locke\u2019s frequent examples, if we\ncould know gold\u2019s real essence, we would then know its\nqualities, even if not a single sample of gold existed.\n\nHad we such Ideas of Substances, as to know what real\nConstitutions produce those sensible Qualities we find in them, and\nhow those Qualities flowed from thence, we could, by the specifick\nIdeas of their real Essences in our own Minds, more certainly\nfind out their Properties, and discover what Qualities they had, or\nhad not, than we can now by our Senses: and to know the Properties of\nGold, it would be no more necessary, that Gold\nshould exist, and that we should make Experiments upon it, than it is\nnecessary for the knowing the Properties of a Triangle, that a\nTriangle should exist in any Matter, the Idea in our Minds\nwould serve for the one, as well as the other (E IV.vi.11, p. 585).\n\n\nWhich qualities exactly would we be able to deduce? We would be able\nto deduce a substance\u2019s tertiary qualities, that is, its powers\nto produce certain effects in other\n substances.[13]\n If we knew the real essences of opium and hemlock, then just as if we\nwere performing a geometric deduction, or just as a locksmith\nunderstands why a given key will open one lock rather than another, we\ncould deduce that opium produces sleep, that hemlock causes death and\nwhy each substance produces its effects.\n\nI doubt not but if we could discover the Figure, Size, Texture, and\nMotion of the minute Constituent parts of any two Bodies, we should\nknow without Trial several of the Operations one upon another, as we\ndo now the Properties of a Square, or a Triangle. Did we know the\nMechanical affections of the Particles of Rhubarb, Hemlock,\nOpium, and a Man, as a Watchmaker does those of a Watch,\nwhereby it performs its Operations, and of a File which by rubbing on\nthem will alter the Figure of any of the Wheels, we should be able to\ntell before Hand, that Rhubarb will purge, Hemlock\nkill, and Opium make a Man sleep\u2026.The dissolving of\nSilver in aqua fortis, and Gold in aqua Regia, and\nnot vice versa, would be then, perhaps, no more difficult to\nknow, that it is to a Smith to understand, why the turning of one Key\nwill open a Lock, and not the turning of another (E IV.iii.25, pp.\n555\u201356) (cf. Boyle, who had had the same idea, explaining it at\nlength in The Origin of Forms and Qualities, 1666, pp.\n16\u201319).\n\n\nKnowing real essences would enable us to deduce tertiary qualities,\nthen. What about secondary qualities, however? Here, matters are\ninitially less clear; Locke seems to be saying that while having more\nacute senses would not eliminate the secondary quality of sound, but\nmight do away with the secondary quality of color. In a passage where\nhe imagines our having very acute senses, including\n\u201cmicroscopical eyes,\u201d he unquestionably assumes that we\nwould still experience the secondary quality of sound: \u201cIf our\nSense of Hearing were but 1000 times quicker than it is, how would a\nperpetual noise distract us\u201d (E II.xxiii.12, pp. 302\u2013303).\nYet, in a preceding passage, he suggested that if our faculties were\ndesigned for detecting real essences, we would not experience color at\nall:\n\nHad we Senses acute enough to discern the minute particles of Bodies,\nand the real Constitution on which their sensible Qualities depend, I\ndoubt not but they would produce quite different Ideas in us;\nand that which is now the yellow Colour of Gold, would disappear, and\ninstead of it we should see an admirable Texture of parts of a certain\nSize and Figure. This Microscopes plainly discover to us: for what to\nour naked Eyes produces a certain Colour, is by thus augmenting the\nacuteness of our Senses, discovered to be quite a different thing; and\nthe thus altering, as it were, the proportion of the Bulk of the\nminute parts of a coloured Object to our usual Sight, produces\ndifferent Ideas, from what it did before\u2026.Blood to the\nnaked Eye appears all red; but by a good Microscope, wherein its\nlesser parts appear, shews only some few Globules of Red, swimming in\na pellucid Liquor; and how these red Globules would appear, if Glasses\ncould be found, that yet could magnify them 1000 or 10000 times more,\nis uncertain (E II.xxiii.11, pp. 301\u2013302).\n\n\nReflecting upon these examples, however, suggests that he is not, or\nnot always, imagining that microscopical eyes would do away with color\naltogether; rather, it might in some cases enable us to view tinier\nparticles having different colors than those we perceive in the\naggregate object. In his example, only as an aggregate body does blood\nas an aggregate body appears uniformly red; under a microscope, only\nthe globules appear red, while some other parts of it seem\ntranslucent. Once the microscope is used, color is not eliminated from\nthe experience of seeing blood, but is instead seen as being\ndifferently distributed. A pixelated painting provides a rough\nanalogy; a shape seen from afar may appear uniformly green, but up\nclose is seen as comprising tiny blue and yellow dots.\n2.2.3 Obstacles to human attainment\n\nScientia in natural philosophy would require knowledge of\nboth real essences and their necessary connections among qualities,\nyet neither is possible for human beings, Locke concludes. One\nobstacle to scientia, then, is that real essences escape us.\nGod has given us sensory capacities that are suitable for such\npractical endeavors as finding our way to the \u201cmarket and\nexchange,\u201d but as the \u201cmicroscopical eyes\u201d passage\nindicates, they are not useful for detecting the minute parts of\nbodies.\n\nAnother obstacle is that we are almost entirely unable to discern the\nnecessary causal connections among the qualities of substances. (And\nLocke does take those connections to be necessary\u2014but does he\nconstrue them in terms of nomological or logical necessity? Given his\nview that demonstrative knowledge in natural philosophy is possible\nfor immortals and serves as an ideal for mortals, he seems to be\nthinking in terms of logical necessity, much like the Aristotelians he\nwas reacting against (see Ott, 2009, p. 13). Locke does find two\ninstances in which we can discern necessary connections between\nqualities of bodies: \u201cSome few of the primary Qualities have a\nnecessary dependence, and visible connexion one with another, as\nFigure necessarily presupposes Extension, receiving or communicating\nMotion by impulse, supposes Solidity\u201d (E IV.iii.14, p. 546).\nApart from these two exceptions, however, necessary connections escape\nus. In part, this is due to the first obstacle, our inability to\ndiscover real essences, due to the minuteness of particles. It is also\ndue, however, to the remoteness of so many bodies, those which lie\n\u201cbeyond this our Earth and Atmosphere\u2026even beyond the\nSun, or remotest Star our Eyes have yet discovered\u201d (E IV.vi.11,\np.586\u201387, and IV.vi.12, p.587). For according to Locke\u2019s\nspeculations, all things might be causally interconnected in complex\nways, in which case knowing one real essence would require knowing all\nthose with which it is causally connected.\n\nStill, while human beings cannot attain scientia in natural\nphilosophy, there are other epistemic agents who can. God certainly\nknows real essences (E III.vi.3, p. 440), and \u201c\u2019tis\npossible Angels have\u201d ideas of real essences as well (E\nIII.vi.3, p. 440).\n\nIt be not to be doubted, that Spirits of a higher rank than those\nimmersed in Flesh, may have as clear Ideas of the radical\nConstitution of Substances, as we have of a Triangle, and so perceive\nhow all their Properties and Operations flow from thence, but the\nmanner how they come by that Knowledge, exceeds our Conceptions (E\nIII.xi.22, p. 520).\n\n\nThat Locke finds it natural to speak in the same breath of matter and\nspirits marks him as belonging to the age of natural philosophy rather\nthan science. It is because knowledge of necessary connections can be\nreferred to these higher epistemic agents that scientia is so\nstrongly entrenched as an ideal, even though he recognizes the need\nfor a quite different conception of knowledge.\n2.3 Human knowledge in natural philosophy (sensitive knowledge)\n\nThe conclusion that no intuitive or demonstrative knowledge of\nsubstances is possible for us because their real essences and\nnecessary connections remain out of reach leaves Locke at a\ncrossroads. One path is the skeptical belief that without certainty,\nno knowledge of substances is possible at all. He rejects that path,\ndenying that hyperbolic doubt could be genuine for either the self (E\nIV.ix.2, pp. 619\u201320) or for external objects (E IV.xi.3, p.\n631). The other path is the one that he follows. Here, he lowers the\nbar by admitting a third kind of knowledge, which lacks certainty:\nsensitive knowledge.\n [14]\n\nSensitive knowledge is knowledge of the \u201ceffects [that] come\nevery day within the notice of our Senses,\u201d without an\nunderstanding of their causes; \u201cwe must be content to be\nignorant of\u201d those causes (E IV.iii.29, pp. 559\u2013560).\nInstead of knowing real essences, the causal basis of the properties\nwe perceive, we know only those perceived properties, from which we\nconstruct nominal essences. Instead of employing deduction, we are\nforced to rely upon \u201ctrials\u201d\u2014observations and\ninduction. Instead of knowing the necessary connections holding\nbetween a substance\u2019s real essence and its other qualities,\nincluding its tertiary qualities (which might include, recall, causal\nconnections with substances beyond the remotest star), we know only\nthe co-existences of properties. And from the mere, regular\nco-existence of properties found in observed cases, Locke observes, we\ncould not know with certainty that the same set will be found\nco-existing in the next case.\n\nFor all the Qualities that are co-existent in any Subject,\nwithout this dependence and evident connexion of their Ideas\none with another, we cannot know certainly any two to\nco-exist any farther, than Experience, by our Senses, informs\nus. Thus though we see the yellow Colour, and upon trial find the\nWeight, Malleableness, Fusibility, and Fixedness, that are united in a\npiece of Gold; yet because no one of these Ideas has any\nevident dependence, or necessary connexion with the other, we\ncannot certainly know, that where any four of these are, the fifth\nwill be there also, how highly probable soever it may be (E IV.iii.14,\np. 546).\n\n\nOur discoveries about co-existing properties\u2014are merely\ncontingent particulars, or, insofar as they are applied beyond the\nparticular cases we have actually observed, are mere probability.\nNevertheless, they can qualify as real knowledge. To qualify, our\nideas must meet certain conditions. The complex idea that we refer to\nas a substance must comprise all and only those simple ideas that we\nhave found to co-exist in nature. With this, Locke aims to show that\nsensitive knowledge deserves its appellation, since it can be\ndistinguished from arbitrary or otherwise poorly grounded claims\n(e.g., that fluidity has been found to co-exist with brittleness, in a\nsingle substance and at a single given\n temperature.[15])\n Sensitive knowledge is something far less than scientia but\nfar more than ungrounded opinion.\n\nHerein therefore is founded the reality of our Knowledge\nconcerning Substances, that all our complex Ideas of\nthem must be such, and such only, as are made up of such simple ones,\nas have been discovered to co-exist in Nature. And our Ideas\nbeing thus true, though not, perhaps, very exact Copies, are yet the\nSubjects of real (as far as we have any) Knowledge\nof them (E IV.iv.12, p. 568).\n\n\nAs for general claims about substances based upon observed particular\nmatters of fact, these too can qualify as real knowledge. Admittedly,\nwhen four of the five properties previously found co-existing together\noccur again, it is only probable that the fifth will be present as\nwell. Yet we can still form an abstract idea of gold, as a substance\nhaving all five properties, and call this general claim knowledge\nbecause \u201cwhatever have once had an union in Nature, may be\nunited again\u201d (E IV.iv.12, p. 568).\n\nHas contemporary science enabled us to go beyond sensitive knowledge?\nIn particular, have discoveries about compounds, elements, and\nsubatomic particles provided us with knowledge of real essences? Much\nof the force of this question derives, to paraphrase Nicholas Jolley,\nfrom the fact that many of those discoveries about matter\u2019s\nstructure were not conceived empirically, but only confirmed\nempirically; they were initially conceived as possibilities through\nthe hypothetico-deductive model, and the predictions deduced from the\nmodels were then compared to empirical data (Jolley 2002, p. 69). Yet\nas Jolley also points out, these commentators may have missed the full\nimport of Locke\u2019s geometric model; in a passage quoted earlier,\nLocke tells us explicitly that if we knew the real essence of gold, we\ncould deduce its qualities even if the metal did not\n exist.[16]\n So while the predictions of any model developed via the\nhypothetico-deductive model must survive the test of observations,\nobservations in Locke\u2019s scientia are wholly\nunnecessary. To put the point another way, Locke takes natural\nphilosophy to be an empirical domain only for human beings, whose\nfaculties are impoverished. For nobler spirits, it would resemble\ngeometry.\n3. Tension in Locke\u2019s thought and a consequent debate\n\nThe last few decades have seen a lively debate about the role of the\ncorpuscular hypothesis in Locke\u2019s Essay. This section\nexamines the sources of that debate and reviews some of the main\npositions figuring in it.\n3.1 Tension in Locke\u2019s thought\n\nAs we have seen, Locke develops some central theses of his\nEssay in connection with the corpuscular hypothesis. In his\ntheory of ideas, corpuscles provide at least a structural basis for\nsimple ideas, and depending upon one\u2019s interpretation, there may\nbe a causal relationship as well. Further, and of particular interest\nhere, Locke often appears to identify a material substance\u2019s\nreal essence with the set or some subset of its component\nparticles\u2019 primary qualities. In the following well-known\npassage, for instance, he points to the primary qualities of a\nbody\u2019s parts\u2014their bulk or solidity, motion, and\nshape\u2014as the causal ground of the qualities we perceive.\n\nThe particular Bulk, Number, Figure, and Motion of the parts of\nFire, or Snow, are really in them whether any ones Senses\nperceive them or no: and therefore they may be called real\nQualities, because they really exist in those Bodies. But\nLight, Heat, Whiteness, or Coldness, are no more really\nin them, than Sickness or Pain is in Manna. Take away the\nSensation of them; let not the Eyes see Light, or Colours, nor the\nEars hear Sounds; let the Palate not Taste, nor the Nose Smell, and\nall Colours, Tastes, Odors, and Sounds, as they are such particular\nIdeas, vanish and cease, and are reduced to their Causes,\ni.e. Bulk, Figure, and Motion of Parts (E II.viii.17, pp.\n137\u2013138).\n\n\nHe similarly seems to identify the real essence of bodies with primary\nqualities just prior to the \u201cmicroscopical eyes\u201d passage.\nThere, he suggests that instead of seeing colors (or instead of seeing\nthem as we currently do), we could discover bodies\u2019 internal\nconstitutions, if only we knew the \u201ctexture and motion of the\nminute Parts of corporeal things\u201d (E II.xxiii.12, pp.\n302\u2013303). A commitment to the corpuscular hypothesis is again\nsuggested when he despairs of understanding the production of\nsecondary qualities: even if \u201cwe could discover the size,\nfigure, or motion of those invisible parts, which immediately produce\nthem [secondary qualities],\u201d we still cannot discover any\n\u201cundoubted Rules\u201d concerning their production or\nconnection, nor \u201cconceive how any size, figure, or\nmotion of any Particles, can possibly produce in us the\nIdea of any Colour, Taste, or Sound\u201d\n(E IV.iii.13, p. 545). Here, he appears to despair of understanding\nhow secondary qualities are produced by primary ones; he appears to\ntake the corpuscular hypothesis\u2019s reductionist claim to be true,\nbut he despairs that we could understand how the reduction works.\n\nHis discussion of tertiary qualities is similar. If we knew the\n\u201cFigure, Size, Texture, and Motion of the minute Constituent\nparts of any two Bodies,\u201d we would then be able to derive\ntertiary qualities; we would be able to deduce that opium causes\nsleep, and we would understand why (E IV.iii.25, pp. 555\u201356; see\nalso E IV.iii.13, p. 545). In all of these passages, then, and in many\nsimilar ones, Locke appears to accept at least some components of the\ncorpuscular hypothesis\u2014that material bodies are compounded from\nminute particles, and certain observable qualities are reducible to\nthe particles\u2019 primary qualities of size, shape, and motion.\nThis tendency to speak as though the corpuscular hypothesis is true,\neither in whole or in part, has been termed Locke\u2019s\n\u201cdogmatic\u201d side (Downing 2007).\n\nIn apparent tension with this so-called dogmatic side is what has been\ntermed his \u201cagnostic\u201d or \u201cskeptical\u201d side. The\nfollowing features of his discussion seem to suggest that he has\nreasons either for remaining agnostic about whether the corpuscular\nhypothesis is true, or more seriously, for believing that it is wholly\nunable to explain the phenomena it purports to explain and therefore\ncannot be true.\n\nFirst, he refers to the corpuscular hypothesis as a hypothesis, and\none that falls well short of providing us with scientific knowledge.\nFurther, he remarks that it is not his aim to adjudicate among\ncompeting hypotheses.\n\nI have here instanced in the corpuscularian Hypothesis, as that which\nis thought to go farthest in an intelligible Explication of the\nQualities of Bodies; and I fear the Weakness of humane Understanding\nis scarce able to substitute another, which will afford us a fuller\nand clearer discovery of the necessary Connexion, and\nCo-existence, of the Powers, which are to be observed united\nin several sorts of them. This at least is certain, that which ever\nHypothesis be clearest and truest, (for that it is not my business to\ndetermine,) our Knowledge concerning corporeal Substances, will be\nvery little advanced by any of them, till we are made see, what\nQualities and Powers of Bodies have a necessary Connexion or\nRepugnancy one with another; which in the present State of\nPhilosophy, I think, we know but to a very small degree (E IV.iii.16,\npp. 547\u2013548).\n\n\nThe hypothetical status of all physical theories is underscored also\nin Some Thoughts Concerning Education: \u201cThe systems of\nnatural philosophy\u2026are to be read, more to know the\nhypotheses\u2026than with hopes to gain thereby a\ncomprehensive, scientifical, and satisfactory knowledge of the works\nof nature\u201d (Locke, quoted in Rogers 1982, p. 230). Still, while\nall physical theories are ultimately hypotheses, it is useful to bear\nin mind Peter Anstey\u2019s remarks about this one\u2019s genesis.\nThe hypothesis originated among theorists championing an experimental\nmethod over a purely speculative one, and while they did not exclude\nspeculation entirely, they circumscribed its role, engaging in it only\nafter observation and experiment had already given the theory a solid\nfoundation. Furthermore, the corpuscular hypothesis had credibility\ninsofar as its theorists avoided the question about matter\u2019s\ninfinite divisibility and thereby adhered to their prohibition against\nquestions they thought could never be answered experimentally (see\nAnstey, 2011, pp. 4\u20135).\n\nSecond, if Locke indeed identifies material bodies\u2019 real\nessences with the primary qualities of their constituent corpuscles,\nthat view of real essences combined with his pessimism about ever\ndiscovering them implies pessimism about the corpuscular hypothesis.\nSpecifically, it implies pessimism about the claims that bodies are\nmade of corpuscles and that those bodies\u2019 observable qualities\nare reducible to the corpuscles\u2019 qualities. In the same passages\nwhere Locke seems to support or assume the corpuscular\nhypothesis\u2019s central tenets\u2014that observable bodies are\nmade up of corpuscles and that those corpuscles have a restricted set\nof inherent properties\u2014he simultaneously appears very skeptical\nabout the possibility of reducing observable properties such as color\nand taste to that restricted set of primary properties.\n\nThird, Locke arguably believes that the corpuscular hypothesis\u2019s\nlimitations are so serious that they amount to fatal flaws, an\ninterpretation that Wilson (1979) was perhaps the first to defend.\nAlthough Wilson develops her line of argument mainly in connection\nwith difficulties Locke raises about the corpuscular\nhypothesis\u2019s purported ability to explain sensation and more\ngenerally, the relation between thought and\n matter,[17]\n some other phenomena are troublesome as well. Locke appears to\nconsider such phenomena so obscure that we can attempt to understand\nthem only by attributing them to God\u2019s direct action.\n\nThe coherence and continuity of the parts of Matter; the production of\nSensation in us of Colours and Sounds, etc. by impulse and\nmotion; nay, the original Rules and Communication of Motion being\nsuch, wherein we can discover no natural connexion with any\nIdeas we have, we cannot but ascribe them to the arbitrary\nWill and good Pleasure of the Wise Architect (E IV.iii.29, pp.\n559\u2013560).\n\n\nElsewhere, Locke will use the term \u2018superaddition\u2019 to\nrefer to God\u2019s role. For the moment, superadded properties may\nbe neutrally described as those that God confers by fiat. Section\n3.3., which reviews some of the main positions in the debate about\nLocke\u2019s stance toward the corpuscular hypothesis, will also\naddress the various interpretations of superaddition.\n [18]\n First, however, we will examine the problematic phenomena.\n3.2 Limitations of the corpuscular hypothesis\n\nThis section examines the four phenomena that Locke seems to consider\ntoo obscure for the corpuscular hypothesis to illuminate. The\nabove-quoted passage mentioned three of these phenomena\u2014 the\nproduction of sensation, the communication of motion, and\n cohesion.[19]\n Locke discusses the fourth, gravity, only outside the\nEssay.\n3.2.1 Sensation\n\nAs we saw in passages discussed earlier, in connection with\nscientia\u2019s impossibility, Locke finds the production of\nsensation to be utterly obscure. One side of the difficulty is the\nnature of the mind. While in all probability, it is immaterial, Locke\nallows the possibility that God superadded the power of thought\ndirectly to matter. The other side of the difficulty concerns the\nnature of secondary qualities as powers to produce sensations. The\nappeal of the corpuscular hypothesis lay largely in its reductive\npromise. Reduction was expected particularly for secondary qualities,\nsuch as colors and sounds, but was also anticipated for ideas of\nmacro-level primary qualities, including visual sensations of shapes\nand sizes, and tertiary qualities. All would be reduced to the primary\nqualities of bodies\u2019 component corpuscles as they interact with\none another and our perceptual systems.\n\nOne part of the corpuscular hypothesis\u2019s purported explanation\nis conceivable, namely, the interactions among the primary\nqualities of bodies, which are supposed to be part of the causal basis\nof our sensations:\n\nThat the size, figure, and motion of one Body should cause a change in\nthe size, figure, and motion of another Body, is not beyond our\nConception; the separation of the Parts of one Body, upon the\nintrusion of another; and the change from rest to motion, upon\nimpulse; these, and the like, seem to us to have some\nconnexion one with another (E IV.iii.13, p. 545).\n\n\nIndeed, we are capable of discerning necessary connections in two\ninstances, as noted earlier. (One case involves only primary\nqualities\u2014 \u201cFigure necessarily presupposes\nExtension\u201d (E IV.iii.14, p. 546)\u2014while the other involves\ntertiary and primary qualities\u2014\u201creceiving or communicating\nMotion by impulse, supposes Solidity\u201d (E IV.iii.14, p. 546).) If\nwe knew more about the primary qualities of bodies, we might multiply\nsuch instances: \u201cAnd if we knew these primary Qualities of\nBodies\u2026we might be able to know a great deal more of these\nOperations of them one upon another\u201d. That is, if we knew real\nessences, we could derive more necessary connections, to know the\ncausal relation between opium and sleep, for instance, and as\ncertainly as we now know that impulse requires solidity.\n\nStill, knowing real essences would not give us any genuine knowledge\nof how sensations are produced by primary qualities. While\ncorpuscular theorists such as Galileo (The Assayer) sketched\na reductive account of our sensations of taste in terms of particles\nstriking our tongues, Locke suggests that any attempt to discover the\nprocess\u2019s details will be foiled. For as far as we can imagine,\na body that strikes other bodies can produce \u201cnothing but\nMotion\u201d\n [20]\n (E IV.iii.6, pp. 540\u2013541), and motion may itself be hopelessly\nobscure, as indicated below. The roles of shape and size are equally\nobscure; we cannot imagine how they could help produce sensations.\n\nWe are so far from knowing what figure, size, or motion of parts\nproduce a yellow Colour, a sweet Taste, or a sharp Sound, that we can\nby no means conceive how any size, figure, or motion of any\nParticles, can possibly produce in us the Idea of any\nColour, Taste, or Sound whatsoever; there is no\nconceivable connexion betwixt the one and the other (E\nIV.iii.13, p. 545).\n\n\nAlthough Locke mentions only secondary qualities here, his point\npresumably applies to all sensations, including our sensations of\nmacro-level primary qualities, such as the shape and size of a\nsnowball or lump of gold. For again, genuine knowledge is knowledge of\nnecessary connections, with the conceptual relations in geometry being\nthe model, and it does not seem possible to discover such connections\nbetween any sensation and the sizes, shapes, and textures that are\nalleged to cause them. Macro-level primary qualities to micro-level\nones and accordingly resemble\n them.[21]\n but the idea of a quality is nonetheless very different than the\nquality itself.\n\nLocke finds that our only way of understanding the production of\nsensation is to attribute the process to God. If we try to understand\nhow motion could produce a color, sound, or taste, \u201cwe are fain\nto quit our Reason, go beyond our Ideas, and attribute it\nwholly to the good pleasure of our Maker\u201d (E IV.iii.6, p.\n540\u2013541; see also IV.iii.28, p. 559). Locke was certainly not\nalone in grappling with this problem. Commenting upon\nDescartes\u2019s account, Walter Charleton (1654, p. 197) had\nobserved earlier that even a detailed knowledge of light behavior\nwould still leave us with the \u201csuperlative difficulty\u201d of\nunderstanding why a certain reflection or refraction should be\n\u201ctransformed into a Vermillion rather than a Blew,\u201d and\nfurther details about our sensory apparatus do not reveal \u201cany\nAnalogy betwixt the Retina Tunica \u2026 and any one\nColour\u201d. Locke was also not alone in resorting to a divine\ncause; in De gravitatione\u2019s creation account of bodies,\nfor example, Newton suggested a divine basis for bodies\u2019\nabilities to stimulate perceptions in minds.\n3.2.2 Gravity\n\nNewton\u2019s Principia implied the possibility of\nunmediated action at a distance, and with its publication, gravity\nbecame the most nettlesome phenomenon for the orthodox version of the\ncorpuscular hypothesis due to its proviso of contact action. Locke was\ninitially sympathetic to the proviso, writing in the first three\neditions of his Essay, \u201cHow bodies operate one upon\nanother\u2026is manifestly by impulse and nothing else. It being\nimpossible to conceive that body should operate on what it does\nnot touch\u201d (E II.viii.11, editions 1\u20133). Yet for the\nfourth edition, he replaced that claim about how bodies do operate\nwith one about how we can conceive of them operating: \u201cHow\nBodies produce ideas in us is manifestly by impulse,\n[this being] the only way which we can conceive Bodies [to]\noperate\u201d (E II.viii.11, edition 4). He also omitted a clause\ndenying unmediated action at a distance, which had appeared in\nII.viii.12 of previous\n editions.[22]\n These subtle emendations reflect a dramatic shift, one expressed\ndirectly in his correspondence with Stillingfleet.\n\nThe gravitation of matter towards matter, by ways inconceivable to me,\nis not only a demonstration that God can, if he pleases, put into\nbodies powers and ways of operation, above what can be derived from\nour idea of body, or can be explained by what we know of matter, but\nalso an unquestionable and every where visible instance, that he has\ndone so (Second Reply to the Bishop of Worcester, 1699,\nThe Works of John Locke, Vol. IV, p. 467).\n\n\nThe phenomenon of gravity\u2014as explained by \u201cMr.\nNewton\u2019s incomparable book\u201d\n(ibid.)\u2014apparently led Locke to abandon the contact\naction proviso and to attribute to matter the power of acting\ndistantly, even though he considered the process by which such\ninteractions could occur so obscure that it drove him to invoke\nsuperaddition. This is the prevailing interpretation of Locke (and was\nassumed by Leibniz, who targeted Locke for it in Against Barbaric\nPhysics), though not all commentators agree, as indicated in a\nsubsequent section.\n3.2.3 Motion\n\nLocke takes the notion of impulse, in which bodies communicate motion\nto one another by surface impact, to be, along with extension and\ncohesion, fundamental to our concept of\n body.[23]\n Indeed, regardless of how motion may actually be communicated,\nimpulse is the only means by which we can conceive of its being\ncommunicated, a view of our conceptual abilities that Locke maintains,\nas we saw, despite his changing thoughts about gravity. Impulse is\nalso fundamental to the corpuscular hypothesis\u2019s explanation of\nphenomena, being either the exclusive means of interaction among\nbodies, as adherents of the contact action proviso hold, or the means\nof at least many interactions. Yet how exactly does a moving body\ncommunicate motion to a resting one simply by impacting it? When we\nattempt to discover the precise nature of the process, Locke suggests,\nwe find that it is just as mysterious as the process by which the mind\nmoves the body.\n\nAnother Idea we have of Body, is the power of\ncommunication of Motion by impulse; and of our Souls, the\npower of exciting of Motion by Thought\u2026. But if here\nagain we enquire how this is done, we are equally in the\ndark. For in the communication of Motion by impulse, wherein as\nmuch Motion is lost to one Body, as is got to the other, which is the\nordinariest case, we can have no other conception, but of the passing\nof Motion out of one Body into another; which, I think, is as obscure\nand unconceivable, as how our Minds move or stop our Bodies by\nThought\u2026.The increase of Motion by impulse, which is observed\nor believed sometimes to happen, is yet harder to be understood. We\nhave by daily experience clear evidence of Motion produced both by\nimpulse, and by thought; but the manner how, hardly comes within our\ncomprehension; we are equally at a loss in both (E II.xxiii.28, p.\n311).\n\n\nSince the corpuscular hypothesis holds impulse to be the primary if\nnot the sole means by which bodies causally interact, then any\nphenomenon that the corpuscular hypothesis purports to explain by\nimpulse will remain obscure if impulse itself remains obscure. All of\nthe hypothesis\u2019s reductions of observable primary, secondary,\nand tertiary qualities, would inherit impulse\u2019s obscurity; thus\nLocke appears to be suggesting here that the corpuscular hypothesis\ncannot fulfill its promise of explaining and reducing those properties\nand powers.\n3.2.4 Cohesion\n\nSince the claim that observable bodies are made up of particles is\ncentral to the corpuscular hypothesis, an immediate question for its\nproponents asks how the particles cohere into compound bodies.\nPlenists have some resources for answering that question, though those\nresources may introduce worse difficulties. Descartes, for instance,\nthough he speaks in terms of particles, understands an individual body\nas an area of extension moving as one with respect to surrounding\nareas. It is not possible for any particle to move away into empty\nspace, there being no such thing as empty space once matter is\nidentified with extension; with every bit of matter pressed from all\nsides by other matter, there is no problem about cohesion per se,\nthough there is certainly a problem about individuating bodies from\none another. In the same vein, Malebranche can invoke the pressure of\nthe air to explain the coherence of bodies, and then invoke the\npressure of an aether to explain the coherence of air particles. Locke\nobjects that this explanation fails because it leaves us with the\nquestion of what causes the particles of the aether to cohere (E\nII.xxiii.23, p, 308). The objection reveals Locke\u2019s atomist\nsympathies, drawing its power from the presumption that there is such\na thing as empty space into which the aether particles could move. The\nproblem for atomist versions of the corpuscular hypothesis is that the\nrestricted set of properties that they allow the particles\n\u2014size, shape, and motion\u2014provides no obvious resources for\nexplaining how the particles cohere with one another to form compound\nbodies. In various forms, the problem about cohesion has dogged\natomists since ancient times.\n\nThe problem arises in two forms, which, to borrow James Hill\u2019s\nterminology (Hill 2004), may be called the limited and the\nfoundational problems. The limited problem, arising for those who take\ncorpuscles to be genuine atoms, that is, to be indivisible, is the\nproblem of explaining how those indivisible corpuscles cohere with one\nanother. This is the problem one finds in Newton\u2019s writings.\nAlthough Rule 3 of the Principia allows the possibility that\nthe least parts of matter could turn out to be divisible, his atomist\nsympathies are evident throughout his writings. He speculates in Query\n31 that in all probability, bodies are made up of hard particles that\nonly God could divide, and in the body of the Opticks (Book\nII, Part III, Proposition VII) he suggests that more powerful\nmicroscopes might permit us to see the larger particles. In answer to\nthe problem of how those naturally indivisible particles cohere, he\nrejects the ancient solution of hooked particles as begging the\nquestion, proposing instead some short-range forces modeled on the\ngravitational force (Query 31). Newton\u2019s speculations about such\nforces are driven by an absence of any resolution to the problem about\ncohesion within the corpuscular theory itself.\n\nThe foundational problem pushes the question about cohesion into the\ncorpuscles themselves. The problem was raised by Joseph Glanvill:\n\u201cIf it be pretended\u2026that the parts of solid bodies are\nheld together by hooks, and angulous involutions; I\nsay, this comes not home: For the coherence of the parts of\nthese hooks\u2026will be of as difficult a conception, as\nthe former\u201d (Glanvill, The Vanity of Dogmatizing, p.\n18, quoted in Hill 2004, p. 616). Without any grounds for asserting\nthat the divisibility of matter bottoms out in indivisible corpuscles,\nthen, the question arises of how the parts of a corpuscle could\ncohere, how the parts of those parts could cohere, and so on, ending\nin the question of how extended bodies are possible at all.\n\nWhatever his ultimate view of the corpuscular hypothesis, Locke\ninevitably faces the atomist\u2019s problem about cohesion, accepting\nas he does void space (see II.xiii.11, 12\u201314, 21\u201323), and\nholding that our ideas of body depend fundamentally upon cohesion. One\nof the ideas \u201cproper and peculiar\u201d to body, he writes, is\n\u201cthe cohesion of solid, and consequently separable\nparts\u201d (E II.xxiii.17, p. 306), and the extension of\nbody, as opposed to the extension of space, is \u201cnothing, but the\ncohesion or continuity of solid, separable, moveable Parts\u201d (E\nII.iv.5, p. 126). Yet we have no understanding of cohesion, and so our\nidea of body does not rest on any genuine understanding of it. In\ntrying to understand how bodies are extended, we are as much in the\ndark as when we try to understand how the soul thinks.\n\n\u2019Tis as easie for him to have a clear\nIdea, how the Soul thinks, as how Body is extended. For since\nBody is no farther, nor otherwise extended, than by the union and\ncohesion of its solid parts, we shall very ill comprehend the\nextension of Body, without understanding wherein consists the\nunion and cohesion of its parts; which seems to me as\nincomprehensible, as the manner of Thinking, and how it is performed\n(E II.xxiii.24, p. 309).\n\n\nOne scholarly debate about cohesion concerns the question of whether\nLocke acknowledged only the limited problem, as one would expect from\ncommentators who read him as accepting atomism (e.g. Mandelbaum 1964,\np. 1), or whether he looked further, to the more serious, foundational\nproblem, as Hill argues (2004). A related controversy, to be discussed\nin the next section, concerns the question of whether Locke concludes\nthat the corpuscular hypothesis simply cannot resolve the problem\n(e.g., Hill 2004; Downing 2007, p. 408) or instead remains agnostic on\nthe issue (e.g., McCann in Chappell 1998, p. 244).\n\nThe four problematic phenomena winnow away the components of the\ncorpuscular hypothesis, as defined at the outset of this article. The\nproblem about sensation threatens the corpuscular hypothesis\u2019s\npromise of reducing secondary, tertiary, and macro-level primary\nqualities to microlevel primary qualities. Newton\u2019s results\nabout gravitational phenomena cast grave doubts upon the contact\naction proviso, and according to some commentators, those results led\nLocke to abandon the belief that impulse is the only means of causal\ninteraction. A corpuscular theorist might hope to preserve some part\nof the theory by insisting that impulse is still the means by which\nmost other causal interactions are effected; but this runs up against\nthe problem about impulse, in that the process by which motion is\ncommunicated seems utterly obscure. Finally, even the core claim that\nobservable bodies are composed of tiny corpuscles is threatened by the\nproblem of cohesion. This last problem threatens to be the most\nserious of four phenomena, for as James Hill has pointed out (2004, p.\n628), the problems about gravity, sensation, and motion arise\nsubsequent to our having conceived of body, whereas the problem about\ncohesion may thwart our very ability to conceive clearly of body.\n3.3 Main positions in the debate\n\nThis section considers some main responses to the tension between\nLocke\u2019s seeming acceptance of the corpuscular hypothesis, most\nnotable in his apparent identification of a material substance\u2019s\nreal essence with the size, shape, and texture of its insensible\nparts, and his pessimism about the hypothesis\u2019s explanatory\npower, most notable in his remarks about the four phenomena discussed\nabove.\n\nOne approach to the tension is to understand it as a genuine\ninconsistency. Margaret Wilson has defended such an interpretation,\nthough in the 1979 paper that launched the debate, her intent is to\nshow how acutely Locke understood the explanatory limitations of\n\u201cBoylean mechanism\u201d. Specifically, Wilson argues, the\ninconsistency reveals Locke\u2019s recognition \u201cthat some\npresumed properties of matter cannot be conceived as\n\u2018natural\u2019 consequences of Boylean primary qualities\u201d\n(Wilson 1979, p. 197). Thus, our ignorance about bodies has more\nprofound causes than our ignorance about the primary qualities of a\nbody\u2019s constituent corpuscles. In accordance with her view that\nLocke\u2019s agnostic tendencies (just like his dogmatic ones) are\ngenuine, Wilson interprets Locke\u2019s concept of superaddition\nrobustly, as a sort of divine action that goes beyond the corpuscular\nhypothesis. According to this \u201cnon-essentialist\u201d or\n\u201cdivine annexation\u201d reading, Locke understands superadded\nproperties as properties that God has annexed to matter by fiat, and\nthat bear no intrinsic connection to matter\u2019s real essence. This\nreading implies a distinction in etiology for superadded qualities.\nWhereas the other qualities of matter are either given initially, as\nthose qualities constituting the real essence, or else flow from the\nreal essence, superadded qualities are added on independently of the\nreal essence, such that the substance would have been complete without\nthem. This view implies that while superadded properties are\nconsistently present, they are inexplicable by physical theory and,\naccordingly, are evidence of divine action.\n [24]\n\nSome other interpretations absolve Locke of inconsistency, either by\nemphasizing his so-called dogmatic side while downplaying or\nreinterpreting his agnostic tendencies, or emphasizing his agnosticism\nwhile downplaying his dogmatism. One line of interpretation, then,\nreads Locke as in some manner accepting the corpuscular hypothesis\n(Mandelbaum 1964, chapter 1; Osler 1970, p. 12; Ayers 1975; McCann\n1994, \u00a71 and p. 85; McCann 2002, pp. 354\u2013355). According to\nweaker versions of this reading, Locke\u2019s project is the\nnaturalistic one of pursuing the philosophical implications of the\nbest available scientific theory, and developing an epistemological\nbasis for it. McCann, for example, reads Locke as defending the\natomist version of the corpuscular philosophy over its Cartesian\ncompetitor by providing an epistemology for it. While Descartes had\nprovided an epistemology for his plenist version, there was nothing\ncomparable for the atomist version associated with Gassendi and Boyle\nuntil Locke supplied it (McCann 2002, pp. 354\u2013355). According to\nAyers\u2019 stronger interpretation, Locke accepts \u201cpure\nmechanism,\u201d that is, the orthodox version of the corpuscular\nhypothesis, which includes the contact action proviso. According to\nthis view, all of matter\u2019s qualities flow from its real essence\n(Ayers 1981).\n\nSince this line of interpretation seeks to downplay Locke\u2019s\nagnostic tendencies, one challenge is to account for Locke\u2019s\npessimism about the possibility of our knowing real essences.\nMandelbaum meets the challenge by confining Locke\u2019s pessimism to\nthe real essences of particular material substances; we are able to\nknow \u201cthe general properties possessed by all material\nsubstances,\u201d and are ignorant only of the \u201cparticular\nsizes, shapes, number, or motions of the particles which go to make up\nany specific object\u201d (Mandelbaum 1964, p. 54). A related\nchallenge is to account for Locke\u2019s appeals to superaddition,\nsince prima facie, Locke\u2019s reason for invoking God is\nthat he thinks the corpuscular hypothesis has no resources for\nexplaining the four problematic phenomena. Ayers responds by rejecting\nWilson\u2019s divine annexation interpretation of superaddition in\nfavor of a deflationary one. According to Ayers\u2019 \u201cdivine\narchitect\u201d interpretation, Locke makes no distinction in\netiology by calling a property superadded; he means only that God\nselected the property with particular care when first creating matter.\nTo diffuse the effect of Locke\u2019s remarks to Stillingfleet, in\nwhich Locke appears to embrace action at a distance, Ayers points to\nLocke\u2019s late manuscript, \u201cThe Elements of Natural\nPhilosophy,\u201d interpreting certain passages as referring\ngravitational effects to an undetectable medium (Ayers 1981, pp.\n212\u2013214). This move has been challenged by Stuart. Claiming that\nthe manuscript was probably written for the education of a child,\nStuart denies that it could trump Locke\u2019s remarks to\nStillingfleet (see Stuart 1998, pp. 378\u2013379).\n\nAnother way to absolve Locke of inconsistency is to emphasize his\nagnosticism or skepticism, while downplaying or reinterpreting\npassages that appear to commit him to the corpuscular hypothesis.\nInterpretations in this vein tend to emphasize Locke\u2019s pessimism\nabout our ability to know real essences, to discern necessary\nconnections, and consequently, have scientia in natural\nphilosophy. Commentators pursuing this line include Downing (1998,\n2007), Jolley (2002), and Connolly (2015); the latter argues for an\neven greater epistemic humility, one extending to real essences, along\nwith superaddition (mentioned briefly below).\n\nThe central challenge facing such interpretations is to account for\nthe passages in which Locke speaks as though he accepts the\ncorpuscular hypothesis, most notably those in which he appears to\nidentify the real essences of material substances with the\ncorpuscles\u2019 primary qualities. Jolley (2002) accounts for\nLocke\u2019s so-called dogmatic tendency in strategic terms.\nLocke\u2019s Essay targets both Aristotelians and\nCartesians, and though agnosticism, which targets the Cartesians, is\nultimately the dominant tendency in his thought, Locke emphasizes the\nexplanatory power of the corpuscular hypothesis whenever he has the\nAristotelians in his sights. Downing (1998, 2007), meanwhile,\ninterprets Locke\u2019s Essay as developing metaphysical\ndistinctions that constrain physical theory, and then downplays his\ndogmatic side by taking the corpuscular hypothesis to be truly only a\nhypothesis for him, and denying that real essence can be identified\nwith primary qualities. Properly understood, Downing argues, the\ndistinction between real and nominal essence is a metaphysical\ndistinction. It is thus more fundamental than the distinction between\nprimary and secondary qualities, which belongs to a particular\nphysical theory, the corpuscular hypothesis. To be worth its salt, a\nphysical theory must meet the metaphysical constraint provided by the\nreal-nominal essence distinction. That is, the physical theory must\nprovide some way of making sense of the notion that material bodies\nhave an internal constitution that is inaccessible to us while\nproducing qualities that are accessible. Locke explains his\nmetaphysical distinction using one physical theory, the corpuscular\nhypothesis, as an illustration, and he often appears to accept or even\ndefend that hypothesis. Still, this is only an appearance, an\nappearance due to a certain advantage that the corpuscular hypothesis\nhas over other physical hypotheses: it is the theory best suited to\nour sensory capacities and understanding. Despite its unique status,\nLocke sees it as a mere hypothesis, one crippled by the explanatory\nlimitations evidenced by the problematic phenomena discussed earlier.\nFor Downing, then, Locke\u2019s dogmatic tendencies disappear,\nleaving only his agnostic side.\n\nTaking a different approach to the situation, Jacovides (2017) treats\nLocke\u2019s descriptions of what we perceive, intuit, and are\ncapable of conceiving as providing a case for testing some Kuhnian\ntheses; as the normal science of his day, the corpuscularian\nhypothesis sets limits upon what Locke can conceive.\n4. Locke and Newton\n\nLocke and Newton probably first met in 1689 (though the exact date is\nnot known; Westfall 1980, p. 488; Rogers 1982, p. 219), and their main\nworks were written independently of one another; Locke\u2019s\nEssay,though published subsequently, was essentially complete\nby the time he read the Principia. A noticeable intellectual\naffinity may nevertheless be seen in those works, and the opportunity\nfor mutual influence followed as they established a friendship,\nexchanging views on a wide variety of subjects, not least certain\nunorthodox theological convictions (see Westfall 1980, 490\u201391).\nThe influence did not run in one direction alone; in a draft passage\nprobably penned shortly after the Principia\u2019s second\nedition, for example, Newton adopts a Lockean tone as he denies that\nany ideas are\n innate.[25]\n As for Newton\u2019s influence upon Locke, the best-known example\nconcerns action at a distance, as noted below, though there are deeper\nquestions about methodology.\n4.1 Epistemology and methodology\n\nA good deal of resemblance to Locke\u2019s epistemological approach\ncan be seen in Newton, who holds that, revelation apart, we must\ngather what knowledge we can from our perceptions, and anything like a\nreal essence eludes us. In the early manuscript, De\ngravitatione, for instance, Newton denies knowing the\n\u201cessential and metaphysical constitution\u201d of matter\n(Newton, 2004, p. 27). He reiterates this position in later texts,\nincluding the 1713 General Scholium:\n\n\nWe certainly do not know what is the substance of any thing. We see\nonly the shapes and colors of bodies, we hear only their sounds, we\ntouch only their external surfaces\u2026.But there is no direct\nsense and there are no indirect reflected actions by which we know\ninnermost substances (Principia, 942).\n\n\nLocke and Newton also share the problem of an evidentiary deficit,\ninsofar as they subscribe to corpuscularianism. Thinkers who did\nsubscribe tended to rely on transduction (also called\ntransdiction)\u2014an inductive inference that is empirical insofar\nas it relies upon observed cases, but which generalizes not only to\nunobserved cases but to those that are\n unobservable.[26])\n Newton\u2019s Rule 3 licensed such inferences, from the\nPrincipia\u2019s second edition onward, for qualities of\ninvariable intensity, i.e., extension, impenetrability, hardness,\nmobility, and the vis inertiae. The rule explicitly permits\ninferences to the realm of the unobservable: \u201cBecause the\nhardness of the whole arises from the hardness of the parts, we justly\ninfer from this not only the hardness of the undivided particles of\nbodies that are accessible to our senses, but also of all other\nbodies\u201d (Principia, Book 3, p.\n 795[27]).\n As for Locke and the problem of transduction, how serious it is for\nhim depends largely upon the status of the corpuscular hypothesis. If\nhe takes an agnostic or skeptical stance toward it, then he owes no\nsolution to the problem.\n\nAlthough the endeavors of Locke and Newton are often considered\ncomplementary, there are questions about how Locke responded to the\nPrincipia, both in terms of its methodology and its\nepistemological implications. With regard to the former, how far did\nLocke go in absorbing or incorporating the methodology that Newton had\nforged? As a number of commentators have emphasized, the new science\nwas itself in flux at this time, with natural history being gradually\nsidelined by Newton\u2019s approach, an experimentalism that was\ntheoretical and mathematical (see, e.g., Anstey 2011; Roux, 2013).\nGiven that Locke had had Boyle as his mentor but was greatly impressed\nby Newton\u2019s Principia, it is natural to ask whether a\nsimilar shift was occurring in Locke\u2019s own thought. Although\nLocke was influenced by Newton, his allegiances to certain older ideas\nran deep. De Pierris (2006) explains Locke\u2019s failure to adopt\nthe method of inductive proof in terms of his devotion to the ideal of\ndemonstrative knowledge, as combined with a belief in hidden primary\nqualities.\n\nWith regard to its epistemological implications, what precisely did\nLocke take the Principia to have achieved? To pose the\nquestion in the starkest possible terms, might Newton\u2019s\nPrincipia have tempted Locke to retreat from his belief that\nnatural philosophy cannot be made a science (much as it led him to\nretreat from the contact action proviso)? Perhaps Locke categorized\nNewton\u2019s epistemological achievement in natural philosophy as a\ncontribution to sensitive knowledge alone. That is, perhaps he saw\nNewton\u2019s \u201cmighty Designs in advancing the Sciences\u201d\n(Essay, Epistle to the Reader, pp. 9\u201310) as confined to\nproviding a firm basis for natural philosophy through his experimental\nmethod. But did he perhaps instead take Newton\u2019s mathematical\nmethods as offering the demonstrations needed to push natural\nphilosophy into the domain of demonstrative knowledge and hence\nscientia?\n\nCommentators interpreting Locke as seeing Newton\u2019s contribution\nin terms of sensitive knowledge alone include Yolton (1969); Woolhouse\n(1994); and Downing (1997, see especially pp. 292\u201393). Winkler\n(2008), however, reads Locke\u2019s correspondence with Stillingfleet\nand other writings from the 1690s as a defense of Newton\u2019s\nmathematical physics, and one that draws from his mathematical\ndemonstrations a greater optimism about the possibility of certain\nknowledge in natural philosophy. This move has been contested by\nDomski (2012), who argues that Locke advocated Newton\u2019s\nmathematical methods only in connection with astronomy, whose objects\nare unavailable for experimentation; and that Locke maintained his\nemphasis upon natural historical methods for questions about\nterrestrial bodies. The debate over the extent to which Locke\nprioritized natural history over experimentalism directly concerns his\nstance on hypotheses (a controversy mapped by Priselac, 2017), while a\nrelated debate concerns the relationship between medicine and natural\nphilosophy. Opposing Yost (1951) among others, Lu-Adler (2021) has\nrecently argued that Locke did not assume that the scientific\nmethodology most appropriate to medicine could be generalized to\nphysics.\n4.2 Ontology\n\nLocke\u2019s discussions of space, body, mind, and God bear some\nstriking similarities to Newton\u2019s, raising questions about the\nextent of those similarities as well as points of influence. Newton\npresents his mature concept of space in the Principia, having\nformulated important aspects of it earlier in the manuscript De\ngravitatione. In both texts, space is distinct from body and is\nreal, infinite, three-dimensional, and homogeneous. Whereas body has\nseparable parts, Newton\u2019s eternal, infinite space is immobile\nand indivisible, having merely distinguishable parts. Although space\nis neither substance nor attribute, it would be a mistake to suppose\nthat it is nothing; as he emphasizes in De gravitatione\n(2004, p. 21, 22), by explaining space\u2019s properties he has shown\nthat it is something.\n\nUnlike Newton, Locke initially accepted a relationist view of space;\nin journal entries of 1676\u201378 and the Early Draft of the\nEssay, space is nothing more than a relation between bodies\nthat do not touch (see Gorham, 2020, p. 221). In the Essay,\nhowever, his discussion of space and its relation to body is strongly\nreminiscent of the Principia\u2019s absolutist conception.\nLocke confesses himself to be among those \u201cwho persuade\nthemselves \u2026 that they can think on Space, without anything in\nit, that resists, or is protruded by Body\u201d (E II.iii.5, p. 126).\nDeclaring that explicating extension in terms of partes extra\npartes would be tautological (E II.iii.15, p. 173) and declining\nto answer the question of whether space is substance or accident (E\nII.iii.17, p. 174), Locke describes our idea of \u201cpure\nSpace\u201d (E II.iii.5, p. 126) as an extension consisting of\n\u201cthe continuity of unsolid, inseparable, and immoveable\nParts\u201d (ibid.; see also E II.xiii.13, 14, which further\ndiscuss space\u2019s perpetual rest and the impossibility of\nseparating its parts, either actually or mentally). Lacking solidity,\nspace poses no resistance to a body\u2019s motion (E II.xiii.12, p.\n172). Again recalling Newton, who takes space to be a consequence of\nGod\u2019s existence (2004, p. 21), Locke invokes God when defending\nhis conception of space: \u201cThose who assert the impossibility of\nSpace existing without Matter, must not only make Body infinite, but\nmust also deny a power in God to annihilate any part of Matter\u201d\n(E II.xiii.21, p. 176).\n\nAnalyzing remarks such as the above, most commentators have concluded\nthat by the time of the published Essay, Locke had fully\nabandoned the relationist view (see Gibson, 1960; Di Biase, 2016;\nGorham and Slowik, 2014; Gorham, 2020). However, Locke tends to\ndescribe our ideas rather than things themselves, and the gap between\nthe two has led a few commentators to conclude that Locke retained his\nearlier relationism or, at least, some inclination toward it (e.g.,\nThomas, 2016; see also Rogers, 1978).\n\nLocke\u2019s concept of body also overlaps considerably with\nNewton\u2019s. In developing a concept of body, Locke notoriously\nfinds the related, general problem about a substratum or substance\n vexing,[28]\n whereas Newton dispenses with the problem more easily. In De\ngravitatione, Newton eliminates the unintelligible notion of\nprime matter by associating perceived properties with determined\nquantities of\n extension.[29]\n Both thinkers attack Descartes\u2019 identification of matter with\nextension, instead sympathizing strongly with the notion of atoms in a\nvoid. Further, Newton\u2019s list in Rule 3 of body\u2019s universal\nqualities includes not only extension, hardness, impenetrability, and\nmobility, but also the vis inertiae\u2014the inherent force\nor power of resisting (Principia, Definition 3), which some\ncommentators take Newton to identify with\n mass.[30]\n Locke\u2019s concept, however, emphasizes extension, mobility, and\nsolidity, without mentioning mass. Still, since Locke explicates\nsolidity in terms of impenetrability, which arises from resistance (E\nII.iv.1), there may be grounds for holding that his concept does after\nall include mass, a position defended by Woolhouse\n (2005).[31]\n At the least, Locke\u2019s discussion of action by impulse\npresupposes mass, as Stein has noted. Nevertheless, presupposing the\nconcept may not amount to including it in the concept of body, since\nas Stein points out, mass for Locke \u201ccannot be construed to\ncorrespond to a simple idea, but can only be understood as a power\n\u2018mediately perceivable\u2019\u201d (Stein 1990, p. 36).\n\nThe question about gravity\u2019s relation to body is also a\npersistent source of controversy for both\n thinkers.[32]\n One point of clarity and consensus is that neither Locke nor Newton\nconsiders the power of gravitational attraction to be essential to\nmatter. Newton consistently denies that it is essential (for instance\nin his explanatory remarks following Rule 3 of the Principia)\nand Locke refers to it only as power superadded or endowed by God.\nLocke\u2019s concept of superaddition is controversial, as noted\nearlier, but he does appear to embrace action at a distance in his\nletter to Stillingfleet. Newton\u2019s writings contain no such\ndramatic pronouncements. So, while a few commentators interpret Newton\nas accepting action at a distance, grounded either in a superadded\nproperty (Henry 1994) or in a relational quality of matter (Schliesser\n2011), his more favorable remarks are at best indirect. Most\ncommentators interpret him as at least having very grave misgivings\nabout distant action, so perhaps Locke was wise to credit his change\nof heart about gravity to \u201cMr. Newton\u2019s incomparable\nbook,\u201d rather than to Newton himself.\n\nWith respect to mind, Locke and Newton are both circumspect about its\nnature and yet may be considered substance dualists. Although Newton\nindicates in De gravitatione that he does not pretend to know\nthe substantial foundation of minds, he consistently presents minds as\nimmaterial, lacking certain characteristics of body, namely, hardness,\nimpenetrability and resistance. Similarly, while Locke explicitly\nallows the possibility of thinking matter in his Essay and\ndiscusses it at length with Stillingfleet, he emphasizes that in all\nprobability, the soul is immaterial (E IV.iii.6, pp. 540\u2013541).\nDoes Locke share Newton\u2019s view that even immaterial spirits are\nspatially extended, such that a mind can co-occupy place with a body?\nA Cartesian interpretation does not seem impossible given\nLocke\u2019s remarks about the possibility of thinking matter, which\ncontrast matter against an immaterial soul that is\n unextended.[33]\n Still, at several passages in the Essay, Locke seems to\nagree with Newton. At E II xxvii.2 (p. 329), he locates minds\nspatially: \u201cFinite spirits having had each its determinate time\nand place of beginning to exist, the relation to that time and place\nwill always determine to each of them its identity, as long as it\nexists\u201d.\n\nFinally, Locke seems to share Newton\u2019s belief in God\u2019s\nsubstantial ubiquity and its implications. As the above-quoted\npassage\u2019s discussion of finite spirits continues, he remarks\nmore generally on the possibility of co-presence: \u201cThese three\nsorts of substances, as we term them, do not exclude one another out\nof the same place\u201d (ibid.). His later remarks about the\n\u201cinfinite Space \u2026 possessed by God\u2019s infinite\nOmnipresence\u201d (E II.xvii.20, p. 222) are similar, but by framing\nthem in terms of third parties\u2019 ideas, Locke leaves more room\nthere for interpretive controversy.\n",
