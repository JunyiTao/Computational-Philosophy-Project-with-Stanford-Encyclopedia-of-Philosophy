    "main_text": "Overtly Foundational Contributions || The Foundations of Analysis\n2.1 The Foundations of Analysis\n\nThe issues addressed in Dedekind\u2019s Stetigkeit und irrationale\nZahlen (Continuity and Irrational Numbers) grow out of\nthe \u201crigorization\u201d and \u201carithmetization\u201d of\nanalysis (the mathematical theory) in the first half of the nineteenth\ncentury. Yet their roots go deeper, all the way down, or back, to the\ndiscovery of incommensurable magnitudes in Ancient Greek geometry,\ne.g., diagonals in unit squares that have length \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) (Jahnke\n2003, ch. 1). The Greeks\u2019 response to this startling discovery\nculminated in Eudoxos\u2019 theory of ratios and proportionality, presented\nin Chapter V of Euclid\u2019s Elements (Mueller 1981, ch. 3,\nCorry, ch. 3). This theory brought with it a sharp distinction between\ndiscrete multitudes (numbers) and continuous magnitudes,\nwhich led to the long dominant view of mathematics as the science of\nnumber, on the one hand, and of magnitude, on the other hand.\nDedekind\u2019s first foundational work concerns, at bottom, the\nrelationship between the two sides of this dichotomy.\n\nAn important part of the dichotomy, as traditionally understood, was\nthat magnitudes and ratios of them were not thought of as numerical\nentities, with arithmetic operations defined on them, but in a more\nconcrete way based on geometry (as lengths, areas, volumes, angles,\netc. and as relations between them). More particularly, while Eudoxos\u2019\ntheory provides a contextual criterion for the equality of ratios, it\ndoes not include a definition of the ratios themselves, so that they\nare not conceived of as independent objects (Stein 1990, Cooke 2005).\nSuch features do little harm with respect to basic applications of the\ntheory; but they lead to inner-mathematical tensions, e.g., when\nsolutions to various algebraic equations are considered (some of which\ncould be represented numerically, others only geometrically). This\ntension came increasingly to the fore in the early modern period,\nespecially after Descartes\u2019 integration of algebra and geometry. What\nwas called for, then, was a unified treatment of discrete and\ncontinuous quantities.\n\nMore directly and explicitly, Dedekind\u2019s essay was tied to the\narithmetization of analysis in the nineteenth century\u2014pursued by\nCauchy, Bolzano, Weierstrass, and others\u2014which in turn was a\nreaction to tensions within the differential and integral calculus,\nintroduced earlier by Newton, Leibniz, and their followers (Jahnke\n2003, chs. 3\u20136). As is well known, the inventors of the calculus\nrelied on appeals to \u201cinfinitesimal\u201d quantities, typically\nbacked up by geometric or even mechanical considerations, although\nthis was seen as questionable from early on. The nineteenth-century\n\u201carithmetizers\u201d found a way to avoid infinitesimals (in\nterms of the epsilon-delta characterization of limits familiar from\ncurrent introductions to the calculus). Yet this again, or even more,\nled to the need for a systematic characterization of various\nquantities conceived of as numerical entities, now in the form of a\nunified treatment of rational and irrational numbers.\n\nDedekind faced this need directly, also from a pedagogical\nperspective, when he started teaching classes on the calculus at\nZ\u00fcrich in 1858 (Dedekind 1872, preface). Consequently, the goal\nfor him was not just to supply a unified and rigorous account of\nrational and irrational numbers; he also wanted to do so in a way that\nestablished the independence of analysis from mechanics and geometry,\nindeed from intuitive considerations more generally. This indicates an\nunderlying philosophical motivation for Dedekind\u2019s work on the\nfoundations of analysis, beyond the pedagogical needs at issue, and it\nis natural to see an implicit anti-Kantian thrust in it. Finally, the\nway in which to achieve all of these objectives was to relate\narithmetic and analysis closely to each other, indeed to reduce the\nlatter to the former.\n\nWhile the general idea of reducing analysis to arithmetic, as opposed\nto geometry, was not new at the time\u2014Dedekind shared it with and\nadopted it from his teachers Gauss and Dirichlet (Ferreir\u00f3s\n1999, ch. 4, Merzbach 2018)\u2014the particular manner in which he\nproceeded was quite original. The crucial issue, or the linchpin, for\nhim was the notion of continuity. To get clearer about that notion, he\ncompared the system of rational numbers to the points on a geometric\nline. Once a point of origin, a unit length, and a direction have been\npicked for the latter, the two systems can be correlated\nsystematically: each rational number corresponds, in a unique and\norder-preserving way, to a point on the line. But a further question\narises: Does each point on the line correspond to a rational number?\nCrucially, this question can be reformulated in terms of Dedekind\u2019s\nidea of \u201ccuts\u201d \ndefined directly on the rational numbers,\nso that any geometric intuition concerning continuity can be put\naside. Namely, if we divide the whole system of rational numbers into\ntwo disjoint parts while preserving their order, is each such division\ndetermined by a rational number? The answer is no, since some\ncorrespond to irrational numbers (e.g., the cut consisting of \\(\\{x :\nx^2 \\lt 2\\}\\) and \\(\\{x : x^2 \\gt 2\\}\\) which corresponds to\n\\(\\sqrt{2}\\)). In this explicit, purely arithmetic, and precise sense,\nthe system of rational numbers is not continuous, i.e. not\nline-complete.\n\nFor our purposes several aspects of Dedekind\u2019s procedure, at the start\nand in its subsequent steps, are important (cf. Ferreir\u00f3s \n1999, ch. 4). To begin with, Dedekind starts by considering the\nsystem of rational numbers seen as a whole. Noteworthy here are two\naspects: Not only does he accept this system as an \u201cactual\ninfinity\u201d, i.e. a complete infinite set that is treated as a\nmathematical object in itself; he also considers it\n\u201cstructurally\u201d, as an example of a linearly ordered set\nclosed under addition and multiplication (an ordered field). In his\nnext step\u2014and proceeding further along set-theoretic and\nstructuralist lines\u2014Dedekind introduces the set of arbitrary\ncuts on his initial system, thus working essentially with the bigger\nand more complex infinity of all subsets of the rational numbers (the\nfull power set). It is possible to show that the set of those cuts can\nin turn be endowed with a linear ordering and with operations of\naddition and multiplication, thus constituting a totally new\n\u201cnumber system\u201d.\n\nIt is not the cuts themselves with which Dedekind wants to work in the\nend, however. Instead, for each cut\u2014those corresponding to\nrational numbers, but especially those corresponding to irrational\nquantities\u2014he \u201ccreates\u201d a new object, a \u201creal\nnumber\u201d determined by the cut (cf. Dedekind 1876b, 1888b). Those\nobjects, together with an order relation and arithmetic operations\ndefined on them (in terms of the corresponding cuts), form the crucial\nsystem for him. Next, two properties of the new system are\nestablished: The rational numbers can be embedded into it, in a way\nthat respects the order and the arithmetic operations (a corresponding\nfield homomorphism exists); and the system is continuous, or\nline-complete, with respect to its order. What we get overall is the\nlong missing, unified criterion of identity for rational and\nirrational numbers, both of which are now treated as elements in an\nencompassing number system (isomorphic to but distinct from the\nsystem of cuts). Finally Dedekind indicates how explicit, rigorous,\nand straightforward proofs of various facts about the real numbers can\nbe given along such lines, including ones that had been accepted\nwithout proof so far. These include: basic rules of operation with\nsquare roots; and the theorem that every increasing bounded sequence\nof real numbers has a limit value (a result equivalent to, among\nothers, the more well-known intermediate value theorem.)\n\nDedekind\u2019s published this account of the real numbers only in 1872,\nfourteen years after developing the basic ideas on which it relies. It\nwas not the only account proposed at the time; indeed, various\nmathematicians addressed this issue, including: Weierstrass, Thomae,\nM\u00e9ray, Heine, Hankel, Cantor, and, somewhat later, Frege\n(Dieudonn\u00e9 1985, ch. 6, Boyer & Merzbach 1991, ch. 25,\nJahnke 2003, ch. 10). Most familiar among their alternative approaches\nis probably Cantor\u2019s, also published in 1872. Instead of using\n\u201cDedekind cuts\u201d, Cantor works with (equivalence classes\nof) Cauchy sequences of rational numbers. The system of such (classes\nof) sequences can also be shown to have the desired properties,\nincluding continuity. Like Dedekind, Cantor starts with the infinite\nset of rational numbers; Cantor\u2019s construction again relies\nessentially on the full power set of the rational numbers, here in the\nform of arbitrary Cauchy sequences; and the two resulting systems are\nisomorphic, as is well known. In these set-theoretic respects the two\ntreatments are thus equivalent. What sets apart Dedekind\u2019s treatment\nof the real numbers, from Cantor\u2019s and all the others, is the clarity\nhe achieves with respect to the central notion of continuity. His\ntreatment is also more elegantly and maturely structuralist, in a\nsense to be spelled out further below.\n",
