Thus the\ndiscovery of evolution is a good starting point for the history of\nphylogenetics. While Darwin was not the first to propose that some\nspecies were genealogically related to others, it was On The\nOrigin of Species (Darwin 1859) that convinced many biologists to\naccept common ancestry and to start building phylogenies. One of the\nimmediate\u2014and ongoing\u2014impacts was the question this raised\nin how phylogenies (i.e., reconstructions of evolutionary history)\nrelate to taxonomies (i.e., how we group taxa).\n\n\n\nFigure 1 Phylogenetic (or evolutionary)\ntrees have become commonplace in biology research articles. This tree\ndisplays a recent hypothesis on the relative placement of lungfish and\ncoelacanth in the evolutionary history of tetrapods (Amemiya et al.\n2013: 312, fig. 1). [An\n extended description of figure 6\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nPre-Darwinian taxonomy focused on classifying according to the\n\u201cnatural system\u201d where taxa were united into large groups\ndue to their \u201cnatural affinities\u201d (Winsor 1976). In an\neffort to clarify the concept of affinity, Richard Owen used the term\n\u201chomologue\u201d to refer to \u201cthe same organ in different\nanimals under every variety of form and function\u201d (Owen 1843).\nPut into an evolutionary framework, the natural affinities uniting\nthese groups were regarded as the result of descent with modification\nfrom common ancestors and \u201chomology\u201d has since become a\ncentral term in comparative biology (Donoghue 1992; Hall 1994). To see\nhow homology relates to phylogenetic inference, as well as to\nintroduce some basic terminology, it will be useful to consider an\nexample phylogeny (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1\n provides a typical contemporary example of a phylogenetic\ntree\u2014a branching diagram that displays genealogical\nrelationships. Phylogenetic trees like these include branches (the\nlines) and nodes (where the lines branch or come together, depending\non the direction you are reading the tree). Terminal branches are\nmarked with the entities whose evolutionary relationships are being\nstudied. In this case those entities are species or higher taxa, but\ntrees may be constructed for other taxonomic levels, or any other\nbiological entities whose evolutionary relationship can be studied\n(e.g., viruses, stretches of DNA, extinct taxa). Phylogenetic methods\ncan even be employed to study ontogeny or cultural evolution, e.g.,\nthey have been used to construct cell fate maps to reveal how the\ndevelopmental parts of a single organism are related (Salipante &\nHorwitz 2006), and used to reconstruct the expansion of language\nfamilies and help estimate historical human migration patterns (Gray\n& Jordan 2000; Gray & Atkinson 2003; Gray, Drummond, &\nGreenhill 2009). More recently, phylogenetic tools have been used to\naid epidemiology studies of COVID-19 (Lemieux et al. 2021).\n\nSince so much of modern biology requires the ability to read\nphylogenetic trees, good guides are commonplace. This includes journal\narticles (e.g., Baum, Smith, & Donovan 2005; Baum 2008; Yang &\nRannala 2012), online guides (e.g., Understanding Evolution,\n Other Internet Resources),\n and more comprehensive textbooks (e.g., Felsenstein 2004; Lemey,\nSalemi, & Vandamme [eds] 2009; Wiley & Lieberman 2011; Baum\n& Smith 2013). Here, we provide only a brief introduction, but\nrecommend any of these (among others) to readers looking for a more\nthorough and technical introduction.\n\nOn the phylogenetic tree in\n Figure 1,\n time passes from left to right with extant groups labeled on the\nterminals of branches on the\n right.[1]\n Starting from the left there are two distinct branches, one leading\nto Cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays), and the other to a node. From\nthat node the branches split, with one leading to Ray-finned fishes,\nand the other leading to another, more recent node (that ultimately\nleads to frogs, lizards, and mammals, among other taxa). Branches may\nbe read as representing ancestral lineages, with nodes representing\ncommon ancestors that diverged (or split) into distinct lineal\nbranches.\n\nWe can also read the tree in\n Figure 1\n by starting with the groups on the right and moving leftward, tracing\nbranches back to where they join at nodes. This direction takes us\nbackwards in time, and allows us to read off which groups are more\nclosely related to others by looking at recency of common ancestry.\nFor example, lungfish are more closely related to frogs than they are\nto pufferfish since lungfish and frogs share a more recent common\nancestor with each other than either does with the pufferfish. To see\nthis, trace back along the branches from each group, starting on the\nright and moving left. You will converge on a node between the\nlungfish and frogs before reaching the node between either of those\ntaxa and the pufferfish. Another way of saying this is that there is a\nmonophyletic group (or clade) that includes lungfish\nand frogs that does not include pufferfish.\n\nA monophyletic group consists of an ancestor and all of its\ndescendants. Some familiar groups turn out not to be monophyletic. For\nexample, if we tried to unite pufferfish and sharks into a single\ngroup that excluded frogs and other tetrapods (such as the traditional\nPisces) we get what is called a paraphyletic group.\nIndividuals in paraphyletic groups all share a single common ancestor,\nbut exclude some descendants of that ancestor. Artificial groups like\n\u201cflying tetrapods\u201d (birds plus the bats) would be called\npolyphyletic since they have multiple, distinct origins.\nBecause paraphyletic and polyphyletic groups do not share a single\nhistory that is unique just to them (i.e., there is no branch on the\ntree that leads just to this group), they cannot feature in\nexplanations in the same way that monophyletic groups can, i.e., they\nlack the utility and explanatory power of monophyletic groups (Velasco\n2008a). For example, biologists might be interested in studying\nwhether flower diversity is driven by pollinator syndrome (i.e., moth,\nbird, or bee) or vice-versa. Phylogenetic principles predict different\npatterns of monophyly on these competing hypotheses, which can be\ntested empirically and used by biologists as they design experiments\nto test for the evidence of selection in cases like these (Whittall\n& Hodges 2007). This is simply unavailable without the explanatory\nand organizing principles of monophyly, and one reason it has grown to\ndominate systematics.\n\nEach node on a tree is the origin of a monophyletic group. For\nexample, the claim that the mammals form a single, united monophyletic\ngroup just means that all and only mammals share (i.e., are descended\nfrom) a common ancestor. We have very good reasons to believe that\nthis is true. For example, all and only the mammals have certain\ntraits (or characters) such as mammary glands, hair, and ossicles\n(three bones in the middle ear). Each of these traits are\nhomologues, i.e., their similarity is due to shared ancestry.\n(Homologous characters are typically contrasted with analogous\ncharacters, i.e., traits whose similarity is not explained by\ncommon ancestry, but by some other process, e.g., convergent evolution\nor reversal). The mammary glands in humans and in elephants are\nhomologous because the trait has been inherited from their common\nancestor. In\n figure 1,\n the ancestor of the mammals is located at the node with branches\nleading to the platypus and the rest of the mammals. Once traits\nemerge (as evolutionary novelties) on a branch they can be passed down\n(unchanged or modified) to the descendants of that lineage. Since\nplatypuses and mice have mammary glands, but no taxa stemming away\nfrom earlier nodes do, we can infer that mammary glands evolved after\nthe node where mammals and birds split, but prior to the mammalian\nnode. That is one way phylogenetic trees support inferential claims in\nbiology. If mammary glands had evolved prior to the node joining\nmammals and birds, then we might expect to find mammary glands on\nbirds or lizards. Platypuses and mice are also born inside an amniotic\nsac, as are turkeys and lizards. However, frogs do not have an\namniotic sac. This tells us that the amniotic sac evolved after the\nfrog lineage branched off from the other tetrapods. Parallel reasoning\nallows us to infer the history of the evolution of bones, tetrapod\nlimb structure, feathers, etc. These homologies form a nested\nhierarchy of traits just as the monophyletic groups are nested, so,\nfor example, the mammals are a part of amniotes which themselves are a\npart of the tetrapods. On the other hand, while the mammals and the\nbirds are both part of the amniotes, they do not overlap at all. And\nindeed, no organisms have both mammary glands and feathers.\n\nExplaining character distributions thus requires knowing which groups\nare clades (i.e., monophyletic groups). Phylogenetic trees depict\nprecisely that, stating which groups are clades. This information is\ncalled the topology of the tree, which conveys the relative\norder of the nodes and nothing about their absolute dating in time.\nKnowing which groups are clades allows us to reconstruct the evolution\nof character traits, and it is the distribution of character traits\nthat is the basic way that we infer which groups are clades in the\nfirst place. This style of reasoning (dubbed \u201creciprocal\nillumination\u201d by Willi Hennig (1966) led to charges of circular\nreasoning from critics of phylogenetic inference (e.g., Sokal &\nSneath 1963), whereas advocates have sought to explain why this worry\nis misplaced (see Wiley 1975; Sober 1988b, among many others). In\nfact, the nested hierarchies of traits is what led systematists to\nclassify taxa into a nested hierarchy in the first place, and it was\nthe nested hierarchy of the taxonomic system that Darwin took to be\nthe most important evidence for common ancestry (Winsor 2009; Sober\n2009, 2010). The problems of understanding what it means for traits to\nbe homologous and of inferring homology will be discussed later\n (\u00a72.1).\n Complicating things, groups of homologies do not always form\nunambiguous nested hierarchies, and sorting out what phylogenetic\nhypotheses are best supported in these cases is a big part of what\ngenerates debates over phylogenetic inference (more on this in\n \u00a72\n and\n \u00a73.\n\nExplaining character trait distributions is just the tip of the\niceberg. Phylogenies are centrally important for all research in\nevolutionary biology. Phylogenetics lies at the heart of the linking\nof the fields of\n systematics[2]\n and population genetics. Knowing a phylogeny is an important first\nstep to studying problems in evolutionary biology, functional\ngenetics, comparative anatomy, and evolutionary developmental biology.\nJust as evolution is the unifying, organizing theme in biology,\nphylogenetics is the backbone of biological inference more generally.\nAs Sterelny & Griffiths (1999: 379) put it, \u201cNothing in\nbiology makes sense except in the context of its place in\nphylogeny\u201d.\n",
