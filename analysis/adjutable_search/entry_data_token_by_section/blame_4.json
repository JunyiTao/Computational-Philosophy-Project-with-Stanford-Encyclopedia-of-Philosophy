    "main_text": "What is Blame? || Functional Theories of Blame\n1.4 Functional Theories of Blame\n\nFunctional accounts of blame are analogous to functionalist theories\nof mental states or properties. Instead of identifying blame with any\nparticular attitude (like a judgment or emotion) or combination of\nattitudes (like a belief-desire pair), functional accounts of blame\nidentify blame by its functional role. This way of proceeding leaves\nopen the particular attitude or combination of attitudes that\nconstitute blame. In this way, functional accounts can be more\nflexible.\n\nAccording to one functional account of blame, the function of blame is\nprotest. In other words, what we\u2019re doing when we blame others is\nprotesting their actions or character. But this, of course, means that\nany number of attitudes or combination of attitudes could be\npresent in blame. Pamela Hieronymi (2001), Matthew Talbert (2012), and\nVictoria McGeer (2013) argue that reactive attitudes like resentment\n(and the expressions of these attitudes) serve as powerful forms of\nprotest. Angela Smith (2013), on the other hand, argues that when we\nmodify our attitudes and intentions as Scanlon envisions, but do so\nas a form of protest, then we are actually blaming. In other\nwords, for Smith, it\u2019s not enough that we modify our attitudes and\nintentions; the modification in question must serve a particular\nfunction, namely that of protest, to count as an instance of blame.\nAnd in order to count as a protest, it need not involve any particular\nemotional state. (See Franklin (2013) and Houston (1992) for more on\nthe way in which blame allows us to stand up for our values.)\n\nThere are at least two sources of concern for those theories that take\nprotest to be the function of blame. First, it\u2019s not clear that\nprotest is independent of blame, such that one could specify what it\nis to protest without appealing to blaming attitudes. But if this is\nso, it\u2019s not clear that appealing to the notion of protest will help\nus clarify the nature of blame. Second, protest seems paradigmatically\nexpressed. Indeed, it\u2019s hard to make sense of unexpressed\nprotest. Do workers protest unfair labor conditions simply through\ntheir beliefs or attitudes? Or must they make such beliefs and\nattitudes known? And if it is the latter, then it\u2019s not clear that\nprotest could be the function of blame. After all, not all blame is\nexpressed. These objections are not decisive, of course, but they do suggest that there is more work to be done in defense of protest views to help us better understand what the nature of protest is, such that appeals to protest can provide a non-circular account of blame. \n\nOf course, there might be other functions of blame: to express or\ncommunicate condemnation or disapproval, for example. Michael McKenna\n(2012, 2013) has argued for such an account. In fact, he has claimed\nthat blame is conversational, and thus functions to continue\na conversation started by the blamee\u2019s wrongful action. In particular,\nMcKenna claims that the reactive attitudes and their expressions serve\nthis function. Antony Duff has proposed a similar understanding of the\naim of blame, according to which it is \n\n\nan attempt to communicate to the wrong-doer a moral understanding of\nhis wrong-doing; to bring him to recognize his guilt and repent what\nhe has done (Duff 1986: 70).\n\n\nAlong these lines Coleen Macnamara (2011, 2015) has also argued that\nour practices of holding others morally responsible more generally (a\nset of practices that includes blame) are communicative in their\nfunction. In a similar vein, Christopher Bennett (2013) claims that\nblame functions symbolically to express our disapproval. Like Smith,\nhe develops this account by supplementing Scanlon\u2019s theory of blame,\nbut it seems that one could adapt Bennett\u2019s expressive apparatus even\noutside of a Scanlonian framework, since the distinctive aspect of it\nis that it expresses something important about our stance\ntowards the blamee\u2019s actions. Most recently, Miranda Fricker (2016)\nclaims that communicative blame, which identifies and communicates\nfaults, is the paradigmatic case of blame.\n\nBecause of their relative newness to the scene, there is not much\ncriticism of these views. However, one potential problem with these\nviews is that many (perhaps most) instances of blame are not expressed\nor communicated. In what sense are those instances of blame\ncommunicative? And if they are not, how can blame be essentially\ncommunicative in its nature? Gary Watson suggests that resentment is\n\u201cincipiently communicative\u201d and says that \u201cin some\nelusive sense, resentment is \u2018meant to be\nexpressed\u2019\u201d (Watson 2011: 328). (That sense remains\nelusive, but see McKenna (2012) and Macnamara (2015) for more discussion.)\n",
