Birthing the Word and Being in the World: Eckhart\u2019s Mystagogical Ethics\n\nAs noted above, for Eckhart there is ultimately no clear-cut\ndistinction between theoria and ethica, nor between\nhis metaphysics and his mystagogy. As with many mendicant orders of\nthe period, the goals of the Meister\u2019s academic work and his\nmission as a preacher and provincial were \u201cinextricably united\nin their understanding of the apostolic goal\u201d (Hollywood 1995\n[2001: 120]). And while much of the more \u201cpractical\u201d and\n\u201cmystical\u201d aspects of Eckhart\u2019s thought come out in\nhis vernacular works, the Meister\u2019s Dominican emphasis on\nintellect over will and the key role of the verbum that we\nfind in his more systematic works remain ever-present themes\nthroughout the Eckhartian corpus. In fact, for Eckhart the intellect\nis the aspect of the human being that most directly reflects the image\nof the Godhead. It is also importantly the space where the Eternal\nWord can be \u201cborn\u201d within us, a concept central to\nEckhart\u2019s mystagogical and moral approach.\n\nHowever, when speaking of the intellect insofar as it images God or\n\u201cbirths\u201d the Word in the soul, Eckhart is not referring to\nthe traditional notion of intellect understood as one of the three\nmain \u201cpowers\u201d of the soul (i.e., memory, intellect, and\nwill). As with his treatment of the divine nature of which it is an\nimage, he means the intellect insofar as it is\nintellect\u2014which, as we saw above, he takes to be pure\nnegativity or \u201cno-thing-ness\u201d. This is not the human\nintellect insofar as it apprehends or \u201ctakes in\u201d the\nenvironment around it via the senses, nor even insofar as it reasons\nabstractly or performs certain cognitive operations to extract\nintelligibles from its sensory input. Rather, it is nothing but\npure potentiality\u2014a wholly receptive intellectus\npossibilis (Largier 2002: 849). To put it in more Eckhartian\nterms, it is the soul taken in its bare (\u201cnaked\u201d)\nintellective essence or ground (MHG:\ngrunt)\u2014which Eckhart characterizes as an uncreated,\neternal aspect of the soul, one related univocally, not analogically,\nto its Creator (Connolly 2014: 162; Kern 2013: 246). Insofar as it\nimages the Godhead in being wholly one and simple (ein und\neinvaltic)\u2014\u201cneither this nor that\u201d (diz\nnoch daz), but a \u201csomething\u201d (waz) higher\nthan any particular thing or created power\u2014it transcends memory,\nreason, will, and even contingent being itself (Largier 2002:\n764\u201365). It even lies beyond the purview of God understood as\nFather, Son, or Holy Spirit. Only the Godhead itself, insofar as it is\n\u201cone and indivisible [einvaltic ein], without mode\n[w\u00eese] or properties [eigenschaft]\u201d, can\nenter into the soul\u2019s ground (Pr. 2; DW I:[43\u201344]; MW\n81). As bare intellect, absent any contingent or created object that\ncould serve to distract it, the soul is able to take on\u2014and\nbecome one with\u2014its proper object, i.e., the eternal\nlogos as communicated in an outpouring of self-giving love by\nthe Father. Thus, the eternal unfolding of the Trinity is, according\nto Eckhart, one that also takes place in the ground of the soul.\n\nThus, the Eckhartian parallel to the Neoplatonic\nreditus\u2014the final end and fulfillment of the human\nbeing\u2014is the \u201creturn\u201d to and unification with the\neinvaltic ein in the ground of the soul. Yet just as the\n\u201coverboiling\u201d of the Godhead into creation proceeds by way\nof the eternally true logos, the return to God can only take\nplace through the Word in the ground of the soul. In the soul\u2019s\nground, Eckhart claims, the human being as an intellective imago\ndei is like a b\u00eewort or\nadverbium\u2014i.e., a \u201csecondary word\u201d that\naccompanies a princip(i)al Word to form a single unit of meaning. Thus\nhe claims, \u201cwhere the [eternal] Word remains\nwithin\u201d\u2014in its intellectual ground\u2014\u201cthere the\nsoul should be an ad-verb and work one work with God in order to\nreceive its happiness in the same inwardly hovering knowledge where\nGod is happy\u201d (Pr. 9; DW I:158; TP 260). In this sense,\nthe ultimate \u201chappiness\u201d of the human being is not\ndistinct from God\u2019s happiness. United in the ground via the\nWord, the soul\u2019s activity is nothing other than God\u2019s\nactivity, and what it is for the human being to flourish just is to\nparticipate in divine happiness.\n",
