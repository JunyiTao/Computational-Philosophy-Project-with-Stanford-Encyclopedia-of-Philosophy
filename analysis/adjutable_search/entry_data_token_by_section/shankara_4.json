    "main_text": "Metaphysics || Two-Tiered Reality\n2.3 Two-Tiered Reality\n\nFor \u015aa\u1e45kara, the existence of the phenomenal empirical\nworld alongside that of nondual brahman is in fact an\nillusory false reality. They are one, not two. Yet the world\u2019s\nindeterminable appearance sets up a two-tiered (or two truths or two\norders) approach to reality: (1) The conventional intersubjective\nempirical reality (vy\u0101vah\u0101rikasatt\u0101) that\ncomprises the universe; and (2) the ultimate reality\n(p\u0101ram\u0101rthikasatt\u0101) of nondual existence that\nis brahman. This hierarchy of two orders and their\nasymmetrical relationship avoids their mutual contradiction. A\nconscientious reader must understand this distinction and be mindful\nthat \u015aa\u1e45kara toggles his perspective between the two. This\ndistinction is also foundational for comprehending his views on\nconsciousness and his philosophical methods intended to culminate in\nmok\u1e63a, more on which below.\n\nThe empirical order is a provisional ontology, whereas the ultimate\nreality is a final ontology. From the provisional empirical\nperspective, our universe is well founded like the pot is founded in\nclay. No object depends on itself, and its dependence is transitively\ndescending to the foundation of nondual existence. The\nuniverse\u2019s relationship with this ground is dependent and\nasymmetrical. This relationship collapses however at the ultimate\norder of nondual reality. For example, \u015aa\u1e45kara can\nprovisionally speak of the relationship of pot and clay (akin to the\nempirical standpoint); but from the perspective of cause and effect\nidentity, there is only clay (i.e., the absolute standpoint). The pot\nform is a mere property, not a substantive. Despite its name and\nfunction, \u015aa\u1e45kara does not ultimately attribute pot form to\nclay because it possesses no being apart from the clay substantive and\nis less real. Similarly, the order of ultimate reality is nondual\nexistence alone, with no second things like properties.\n\nOne cannot count two things, existence and object or existence and\nproperty, as equally existing across two orders of reality. Nor does\ncausation cross between two orders. In fact, from the ultimate\nperspective, the world (including the individual) is never truly born\nbecause nonduality is not subject to causation. It has no parts, is\nnot bound by time or space, and is changeless (BrS\u016bBh 2.1.14).\nSimilarly, the pot-space which appears to be delimited by the walls of\nthe pot does not delimit space itself\u2014it is never truly born\nfrom infinite space (GKBh 3.3\u20139). Therefore, the ultimate\nreality perspective excludes any dependence relations to make sense of\nmetaphysical grounding. (See GKBh 2.32\u201333, 3.3\u20139 for\ndiscussions of brahman as that which has no birth\n(aj\u0101ti) as the universe).\n\nThe clay-pot example falls short of adequately illustrating the two\norders of reality. \u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s more apt illustration is\nour phenomenal worlds of waking and dreaming, by which he can pump the\nintuition that there is no objective causation between the two states.\nFor example, the dreamscape or an object like a dream clay-pot, is\nwell founded in the dreamer\u2019s cognition born of waking\nperceptual memory. This ontological dependence is asymmetrical. The\ndream pot depends on the memory of a waking pot cognition, but not\nvice versa; however, the dreamer cannot discover that causation solely\nfrom within the dream\u2019s objective reality no matter how hard\nthey reductively squeeze the dream pot. The dream pot\u2019s ground\nis in the waking state, and discovering that waking reality\nsimultaneously falsifies the dream world. After awakening, there is no\ndream to speak of, no level playing field for causation across the two\norders. Similarly, discovering the metaphysical ground of the\nempirical universe transitions to the ultimate reality of nondual\nexistence, in which there is no world of forms to question and no\nlevels of hierarchy remaining. (See Ram-Prasad 2002 on\n\u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s use of the dream analogy).\n\nIn this way, even though \u015aa\u1e45kara assumes realism at the\nempirical level in terms of veridical cognition, he negates it\nmetaphysically from the absolute level. This leads him to a position\nof non-realism (Ram-Prasad 2002). From the empirical standpoint, these\ntwo orders seem to exist simultaneously and possess an asymmetrical\nrelationship\u2014the world is dependent upon brahman for\nits existence, yet brahman has no dependence on the world\neven though immanent in it. Only from the absolute standpoint does\nempirical reality collapse into brahman. The ultimate reality\nperspective metaphysically devours the world, all of its causation,\nand even its status as an appearance. From the nondual standpoint\nthere is only brahman. Brahman never undergoes\ngenuine transformation (pari\u1e47\u0101ma) into the world,\njust as a rope mistaken to be a snake does not actually transform into\na snake. Nor is the snake separate from the rope.\n",
