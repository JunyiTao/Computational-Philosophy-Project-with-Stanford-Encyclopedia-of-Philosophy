    "main_text": "New Developments for Reliabilism || Normality Reliabilism\n3.1 Normality Reliabilism\n\nAs we saw in\n \u00a72.2,\n a crucial question facing reliability theories concerns the domain in\nwhich a process is assessed for reliability. Recently, some writers\nhave explored the idea that we should take this domain to be the\nnormal conditions for the use of a given process.\n\nFor example, Jarrett Leplin (2007, 2009) rejects the common view of\nreliable processes as those that produce a high ration of truths to\nfalsehoods. In its place, Leplin advances a conception of reliability\naccording to which a process/method is reliable if it would never\nproduce or sustain false beliefs under normal conditions (see\nLeplin 2007: 33: 2009: 34\u201335). A similar proposal has been\ndeveloped by Peter Graham (e.g., Graham, 2012, 2020). Graham draws on\nan etiological account of function due to Larry Wright (1973) and Ruth\nMillikan (1984), among others, to advance a theory of epistemic\nentitlement in terms of proper functioning. Then, like Leplin, Graham\ntries to use a normality approach to address some familiar\ncounterexamples to process reliabilism.\n\nWhy favor a normality-based version of reliabilism? One motivation\ncomes from the new evil demon problem. The victim of the evil demon\nforms beliefs using perception\u2014a process that is unreliable at\ntheir world. But, the response runs, the normal conditions for\nperception are free from evil demons and the like. At these worlds,\nperception is indeed reliable.\n\nThere remains work to be done in developing a normality-based version\nof reliability, particularly when it comes to elucidating the notion\nof \u201cnormal conditions\u201d here. But at the very least\nnormality-based approaches offer a welcome variant on more traditional\nforms of reliabilism. Normality-based approaches also parallel recent\ndevelopments in the analysis of knowledge. For example, D. Greco\n(2014), taking inspiration from an idea in Dretske (1981), develops an\ninformation-theoretic analysis of knowledge, which he cashed out in\nterms of normal conditions. In a similar vein, both Goodman and Salow\n(2018) and Beddor and Pavese (2020) have proposed \u201cnormal\nconditions\u201d variants of a safety condition on knowledge (of the\nsort discussed in\n \u00a71).\n",
