    "main_text": "\n\nQuantum theory is fundamental to contemporary\n physics.[1]\n It is natural to view a fundamental physical theory as describing or\nrepresenting the physical world. But many physicists and some\nphilosophers have questioned or rejected this view of quantum theory.\nThey have viewed the theory as concerned with our observation and\ndescription of, knowledge or beliefs about, or interactions with the\nworld. Views of this kind have been expressed since the 1920s when\nquantum theory emerged in close to its present form. This entry is\nconcerned with more recent developments of this tradition by\nphysicists and philosophers, much of it described as quantum-Bayesian\nor pragmatist. This entry discusses the form of quantum-Bayesianism\nknown as QBism in section 1, addressing common objections in section\n2. After section 3 briefly notes pragmatist influences on QBism\nsection 4 sketches a variety of self-described pragmatist approaches\nto quantum theory, while section 5 mentions some related views.\n",
