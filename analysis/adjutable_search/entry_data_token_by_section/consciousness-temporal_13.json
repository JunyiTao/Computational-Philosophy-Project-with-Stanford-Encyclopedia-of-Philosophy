    "main_text": "Extensional Approaches || Origins: A Dogma Rejected\n5.1 Origins: A Dogma Rejected\n\nStern observes at the start of his \u201cMental Presence-Time\u201d\n(1897 [2005]) that much recent work in psychology makes an assumption\nabout the kind of unities that can exist within experience: only\ncontents that are instantaneous and simultaneous can\nbe apprehended together. Needless to say, this assumption amounts to a\ncommitment to PSA\u2014see\n \u00a71.2.\n Stern proposes that we reject this constraint:\n\n\nThat only those contents can belong to a whole of consciousness that\nexist together and are simultaneously present at any given time\n\u2026 is a dogma, which, in a more or less veiled form, determines\nnumerous psychological reflections. I consider this dogma, at least in\nthis generalized form, to be false. I believe that there are instances\nwhen an apprehension first comes into being on the basis of temporally\nextended content of consciousness, in such a manner that every part of\nthis content exists in an insoluble connection with every other part.\n(Stern, 1897 [2005: 313])\n\n\nRejecting PSA brings a number of advantages. Experienced contents\nwhich appear to be successive can really be successive, rather than\nexisting simultaneously (as with retentional models), similarly\nepisodes of consciousness which seem to persist through intervals of\nordinary objective time can really do so. Abandoning the dogma means\nthat temporal consciousness need no longer be systematically\nmisleading as to its own nature. Stern was well aware why his\ncontemporaries maintained that it was necessary to distinguish a\nsuccession of experiences from an experience of succession. A sequence\nof musical notes will only be experienced as a succession if they are\nexperienced together, with each being experienced as following on from\nits predecessor. Stern was simply suggesting that these unified\nexperiential episodes are themselves extended over temporal intervals\nrather than momentary.\n\n\nI therefore put forth the following principle: mental events that play\nthemselves out within a stretch of time can under circumstances form a\nunified and complex act of consciousness regardless of the\nnon-simultaneity of individual parts. That stretch of time over which\na mental act can be extended I call its presence-time. (Stern 1897\n[2005: 315])\n\n\nWundt held that complexes of sensory contents could only be\napprehended directly if they exist in a conscious whole\nsimultaneously. Stern rejects this: \u201cAs a whole, yes; as\nsimultaneous, no\u201d (1897 [2005: 319]). What of the notion\n\u201cthe present\u201d if we follow Stern and embrace an\nextensional model of temporal experience? Stern suggests we\nneedn\u2019t reject the idea that experiences can be present. All we\nneed do is define the present \u201cas the totality of temporal and\nspatial relations that can become the object of a direct\nperception\u201d (1897 [2005: 325]). Since we directly perceive\nevents spanning brief intervals, the present thus construed is a\npositive and finite stretch of time.\n\nHow do individual presence-times combine to form streams of\nconsciousness? In ordinary life we are, after all, continually\nconscious for hours at a stretch, whereas individual presence-times\nare very short. Stern does not address this question in his article so\nhe can offer little assistance\u2014see Dainton (2017b) for a fuller\naccount of Stern's views \u2014however it was not long before a\npromising proposal emerged. In 1915 Bertrand Russell published his\n\u201cOn the Experience of Time\u201d in The Monist, where\nthe stream-composition question is addressed. Russell begins by\nintroducing some key terms and theses. A sensation involves a\nsubject standing in the acquaintance relation with an object or\nsense-datum. Russell makes it clear that he believes change can be\ndirectly experienced, telling us:\n\n\nSuccession is a relation which may hold between two parts of\none sensation, for instance between two parts of a swift movement\nwhich is the object of one sensation; it may then, and perhaps also\nwhen one or both objects are objects of immediate memory, be\nimmediately experienced, and extended by inference to cases where one\nor both of the terms are not present. (1915: 213)\n\n\nHow do specious presents combine to form entire streams of\nconsciousness? Here Russell usefully goes beyond Stern and proposes\nthat neighbouring specious presents in the same stream of\nconsciousness are related by overlap or part-sharing. Let\u2019s\nsuppose A, B, C are brief sounds of the same duration that are\nexperienced as a succession in the same continuous stream of\nconsciousness; let\u2019s also suppose that the lengths of these\nsounds are such that only two of them can be experienced together.\nRussell suggests that the resulting temporally extended experience\nwill include two specious presents [A-followed-by-B] and\n[B-followed-by-C], and since the experiencing of the B-sound is\nnumerically identical with the experiencing of the B-sound in the\nlater specious present the B is heard just once, not twice. The\nresulting stream of auditory consciousness consists of a continuous\nsuccession of sounds, each heard as following on from its predecessor,\nwhere only two sounds are experienced together as directly\nsuccessive.\n\nRussell goes on to offer a further important observation:\n\n\nIf A, B and C succeed each other rapidly, A and B may be parts of one\nsensation, and likewise B and C, while A and C are not parts of one\nsensation. But A is remembered when C is present in sensation. In such\na case, A and B belong to the same present, and likewise B and C, but\nnot A and C; thus the relation \u201cbelong to the same\npresent\u201d is not transitive. (Russell 1915: 233)\n\n\nAs Russell clearly appreciates, if the relation of \u201cbelonging to\nthe same present\u201d were transitive, then A would\nnecessarily belong to the same (specious) present as C, and more\ngenerally, all the partially overlapping phases of a stream of\nconsciousness would have the character of a single unified specious\npresent\u2014and so you would now be directly experiencing what you\nsaw and heard when you first awoke this morning. Since this is\nmanifestly not the case, the \u201cbelonging to the same\npresent\u201d relation is clearly not transitive.\n",
