    "main_text": "Marxism, Work, and Human Nature\n1. Marxism, Work, and Human Nature\n\nMarxism as a philosophy of human nature stresses the centrality of\nwork in the creation of human nature itself and human\nself-understanding.  Both the changing historical relations between\nhuman work and nature, and the relations of humans to each other in\nthe production and distribution of goods to meet material needs\nconstruct human nature differently in different historical periods:\nnomadic humans are different than agrarian or industrial\nhumans. Marxism as a philosophy of history and social change\nhighlights the social relations of work in different economic modes of\nproduction in its analysis of social inequalities and exploitation,\nincluding relations of domination such as racism and sexism. (Marx\n1844, 1950, 1906\u20139; Marx and Engels 1848, 1850; Engels\n1942). Within capitalism, the system they most analyzed, the logic of\nprofit drives the bourgeois class into developing the productive\nforces of land, labor and capital by expanding markets, turning land\ninto a commodity and forcing the working classes from feudal and\nindependent agrarian production into wage labor. Marx and Engels argue\nthat turning all labor into a commodity to be bought and sold not only\nalienates workers by taking the power of production away from them, it\nalso collectivizes workers into factories and mass assembly\nlines. This provides the opportunity for workers to unite against the\ncapitalists and to demand the collectivization of property, i.e.,\nsocialism, or communism.\n\nAccording to Engels\u2019s famous analysis of women\u2019s situation\nin the history of different economic modes production in The\nOrigin of the Family, Private Property and the State (1942),\nwomen are originally equal to, if not more powerful than, men in\ncommunal forms of production with matrilineal family organizations.\nWomen lose power when private property comes into existence as a mode\nof production. Men\u2019s control of private property, and the\nability thereby to generate a surplus, changes the family form to a\npatriarchal one where women, and often slaves,\n [1]\n become the property of the father and husband.\n\nThe rise of capitalism, in separating the family household from\ncommodity production, further solidifies this control of men over\nwomen in the family when the latter become economic dependents of the\nformer in the male breadwinner-female housewife nuclear family form.\nImportantly, capitalism also creates the possibility of women\u2019s\nliberation from family-based patriarchy by creating possibilities for\nwomen to work in wage labor and become economically independent of\nhusbands and fathers. Engels stresses, however, that because of the\nproblem of unpaid housework, a private task allocated to women in the\nsexual division of labor of capitalism, full women\u2019s liberation\ncan only be achieved with the development of socialism and the\nsocialization of housework and childrearing in social services\nprovided by the state. For this reason, most contemporary Marxists\nhave argued that women\u2019s liberation requires feminists to join\nthe working class struggle against capitalism (Cliff 1984).\n",
