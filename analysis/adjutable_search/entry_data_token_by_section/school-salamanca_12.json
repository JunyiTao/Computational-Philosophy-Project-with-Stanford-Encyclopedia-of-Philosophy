The Influence of the School of Salamanca\n\nIt is difficult to give a precise evaluation of the influence of the\nSchool of Salamanca in the many fields to which it contributed. There\nare various ideological motives, apart from the general tendency to\nconceal one\u2019s sources, why later authors did not mention these\ntheologians. This was especially the case for philosophers,\ntheologians and legal theorists from the Protestant North with their\naversion to Catholic thinkers, and especially Jesuits. Quarrels arose,\nfor instance, as to whether the Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius\n(1583\u20131645) was the father of modern natural law and\ninternational law or whether he only copied and slightly altered the\nworks of Su\u00e1rez and other Spanish authors. Another pertinent\nissue is that Su\u00e1rez was regarded as the\nrepresentative of \u201cthe schools\u201d, to which the founders of\nmodern philosophy opposed their new philosophical systems, often\ndenying their heritage. Some works by Spanish Scholastics therefore\nfell into oblivion. In recent years, however, the ideological barriers\nhave vanished, and there is a growing interest in an open-minded\ndiscussion of the School\u2019s achievements and impact.\n\nAs has been indicated, the School of Salamanca is credited with a role\nin the development of international law. The gradual detachment of the\nius gentium from natural law, particularly as it pertained to\nissues such as slavery and the slave trade, was another notable\naccomplishment; so too, was its consistent defense of the full\nhumanity of the Amerindians. That argument could be applied to other\nnon-European peoples who had also never heard of Jesus; their regimes\nand property rights were closely tied to reason and natural law.\n\nThe School, in addition, made important contributions to areas such as\ntrade and finance. Azpilcueta\u2019s approach to inflation and his\ndefense of the morality of exchange was a step toward a culture of\naccepted risk and profit. Vitoria\u2019s argument that commerce fell\nwithin the ius gentium was not embraced by everyone in the\nSchool; but this argument had a direct influence on Grotius. Moreover,\nalthough a Protestant and an opponent of papal claims to temporal\npower, Grotius drew on Thomas Aquinas, Cajetan, and Vitoria to argue\nfor the freedom of the seas and to develop a framework for\ninternational law. Because of the School\u2019s role in the\ndevelopment of economic theory, some economists, including those\nbelonging to the Austrian School of National Economy, refer to them as\ntheir ancestors.\n\nSu\u00e1rez and Mariana formulated theories of resistance to\nunacceptable rulers, which Roman Catholic thinkers engaged in opposing\nProtestantism and Protestant rulers like James I found attractive. In\nthe heated atmosphere of the times, it is possible that these theories\nmay have inspired the Catholic fanatics who assassinated Henry III\n(Valois), Henry IV (Bourbon), and William the Silent (Nassau). Similar\ntheories were also developed by Protestant writers, including French\nHuguenots and Calvinists in the Low Countries.\n\nMembers of the School of Salamanca departed from Aristotle and Thomas\nAquinas as they saw fit. This is apparent in Soto\u2019s logic and\nSu\u00e1rez\u2019s widely read metaphysics. Less noted until\nrecently is the influence of Soto on Galileo. Diverging from\nAristotle, Soto advanced theories that have been described (Duhem\n1913: 193) as forerunners of the modern idea of mechanics. His theory\nof falling bodies was well known to Jesuit scholars, who circulated it\nthrough their writings. As a young student, Galileo was probably\nexposed to these ideas, which influenced his approach to the physical\nlaws governing the universe (Wallace 1981 and 2004). Galileo\u2019s\ntheories about falling bodies eclipsed Soto\u2019s, while his\nastronomical observations helped to create a heliocentric and\nun-Aristotelian intellectual milieu, in which many ideas of the School\nof Salamanca were regarded as obsolete. Even in Spain,\nthe novatores thought the Scholastics were no longer\nrelevant, not even having read Descartes (G\u00f3mez Par\u00eds\n2022: 563, 570).\n\nStarting in the 1930s, with the work of James Brown Scott and others,\nthe School of Salamanca gained renewed attention for its contribution\nto ideas of international law, including respect for non-Christian\npeoples. Academic interest overcame old prejudices tied to\nEurope\u2019s past confessional and ideological divisions. The\ninterest of economists in monetarism also placed Salamanca in the\nscholarly mainstream. The revived study of Scholasticism has drawn\nattention to Soto, Molina and Su\u00e1rez, while modern editions,\nincluding those in the series \u201cCorpus Hispanorum de Pace\u201d,\nhave made these thinkers more accessible to a new generation of\nscholars. \n",
