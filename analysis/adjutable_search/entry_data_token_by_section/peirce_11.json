    "main_text": "The Classification of the Sciences\n12. The Classification of the Sciences\n\n\nPeirce maintained a considerable interest in the topic of\nclassification or taxonomy in general, and he considered biology and\ngeology the foremost sciences to have made progress in developing\ngenuinely useful systems of classification for things. In his own\ntheory of classification, he seemed to regard some sort of cluster\nanalysis as holding the key to creating really useful\nclassifications. He regularly strove to create a classification of all\nthe sciences that would be as useful to logic as the taxonomies of the\nbiologists and geologists were to these scientists.  Of special\ninterest in this regard is the fact that he considered the relation of\nsimilarity to be a triadic relation, rather than a dyadic\nrelation. Thus, for Peirce taxonomies and taxonomic trees are only one\nsort of classificatory system, albeit the most highly-developed\none. He would not be in the least surprised to find that the topic of\nconstructing \u201contologies\u201d is in vogue among computer\nscientists, and he would applaud endeavors to construct ontologies. He\nwould not find in the least alien many contemporary analytic\ndiscussions of the notion of similarity; he would be right at home\namong them.\n\n\nAs with many of Peirce\u2019s classificatory divisions, his classification\nof the sciences is a taxonomy whose tree is trinary. For example he\nclassifies all the sciences into those of discovery, review, and\npracticality.  Sciences of discovery he divides into mathematics,\nphilosophy, and what he calls \u201cidioscopy\u201d (by which he\nseems to mean the class of all the particular or special sciences like\nphysics, psychology, and so forth).  Mathematics he divides into\nmathematics of logic, of discrete series, and of continua and\npseudo-continua. Philosophy he divides into phenomenology, normative\nscience, and metaphysics. Normative science he divides into\naesthetics, ethics, and logic. And so on and on.  Very occasionally\nthere is found a binary division: for example, he divides idioscopy\ninto the physical sciences and the psychical (or human) sciences. But,\nhardly surprisingly given his penchant for triads, most of his\ndivisions are into threes.\n\n\nPeirce scholars have found the topic of Peirce\u2019s classification of the\nsciences a fertile ground for assertions about what is most basic in\nall thinking, in Peirce\u2019s view. Whether or not such assertions run\nafoul of Peirce\u2019s anti-foundationalism is itself a topic for further\nstudy.\n",
