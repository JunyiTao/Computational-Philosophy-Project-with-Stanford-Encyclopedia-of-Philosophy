    "main_text": "Criticism\n9. Honors and Legacy\n\n\nLargely ignored by academic philosophers, Buber was already widely\nrecognized and reviewed across the larger field of German letters\nbefore World War I. He rose to renewed prominence in Germany\nafter World War II, where his Bible translation, collections of Hasidic\nstories, and writings on the philosophy of dialogue have remained in\nprint ever since. Among the honors Buber received after 1945 were the\nGoethe Prize of the City of Hamburg (1951), the Friedenspreis des\nDeutschen Buchhandels (Frankfurt am Main, 1953), and the Erasmus Prize\n(Amsterdam, 1963). Significant students who considered their own work a\ncontinuation of Buber\u2019s were Nahum Glatzer (Buber\u2019s only\ndoctoral student during his years at the university in Frankfurt,\n1924\u20131933, later an influential teacher of Judaic Studies at Brandeis\nUniversity), Akiba Ernst Simon (historian and theorist of education in\nIsrael who first met Buber at the Freies j\u00fcdisches Lehrhaus in\nFrankfurt, and who returned from Palestine to work with Buber for the\nMittelstelle f\u00fcr j\u00fcdische Erwachsenenbildung), and\nimportant Israeli scholars, such as Shmuel Eisenstadt, Amitai Etzioni,\nand Jochanan Bloch, who knew Buber in his later years when he taught\nseminars on social philosophy and education at the Hebrew University\nof Jerusalem. As for the United States, Buber\u2019s American translator\nand biographer Maurice Friedman, a prolific author in his own right,\nalmost single-handedly introduced Buber to post-war American religion\nscholars and the larger reading public. In addition to Friedman,\nWalter Kaufmann, the author of one of the first English-language\nstudies of Nietzsche as well as books on religion and existentialism,\nhelped to popularize Buber in the United States, despite the\nabove-cited critique of Buber\u2019s I and Thou. It was Kaufmann\nwho first included Buber in the canon of religious existentialism in\nthe 1950s and 1960s. In Jewish philosophy, Buber\u2019s name has since been\neclipsed by those of Franz Rosenzweig and Emmanuel Levinas.\n",
