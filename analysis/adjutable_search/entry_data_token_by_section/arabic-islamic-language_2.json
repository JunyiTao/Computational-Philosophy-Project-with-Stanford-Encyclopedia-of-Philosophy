    "main_text": "Historical Outline || Avicennan Aristotelianism\n1.3 Avicennan Aristotelianism\n\nAt the same time that the Baghdad philosophers were finalizing the\ntranslation of the Organon and furnishing it with extensive\nglosses, Avicenna (d.\u00a01037) was beginning his career far away in\nthe east, in Khurasan. His style of philosophy was to make the\nAristotelian texts irrelevant for the dominant tradition of Arabic\nlogic after him. Led by his\n Intuition,[11]  \nhe presented himself as an\nautodidact able to assess and repair the Aristotelian\n tradition. In other words,\nAvicenna's doctrine of Intuition delivered him an Aristotelianism\nunfettered by the hermeneutic commitments of the Lesser Harmony.\n\nIn the modal logic, for example (a subject voluminously contested in\nthe Arabic tradition; see 2.3 below), \nhe cut through the problems in\nthe Aristotelian account by taking them either as tests of the\nstudent's acuity, or mistakes by Aristotle in implementing principles.\nHere is what he says in the Syllogism of the Cure,\nwritten about midway through his career:\nYou should realize that most of what Aristotle's writings\nhave to say about the modal mixes are tests, and are not genuine\nopinions\u2014this will become clear to you in a number of\nplaces\u2026 (Avicenna Qiy\u00e2s [1964]\n204.10\u201312)\n\nIn his later writings, Avicenna is less solicitous in explaining away\nwhat he regards as inconsistencies in Aristotle's syllogistic, and\nwrites of problems in the Prior Analytics as arising through\nnegligence; an example of such a text is Twenty Questions,\nwhich I think is written on the eve of Avicenna's Eastern period\n(Street 2010: 100\u2013103; see periodization in Gutas 1988: 144). It\nconsists of answers to questions on syllogistic sent by the learned men\nof Shiraz (and thus shows how odd Avicenna's system\nmust have seemed to his contemporaries). Why, they ask, has Avicenna\nproduced a syllogistic system that differs so radically from\nAristotle's? At various points, we find Avicenna presenting Aristotle's\ndecisions (about mixes with possibility propositions as minor premises)\nas failures to implement general principles (Avicenna \nal-Mas\u00e2\u2018il al-Ghar\u00eeba: [1974] 94.14, 94.20, 94.22, 95.5,\n95.11).\n\nAvicenna's Intuition not only set aside important parts of Aristotle's\nlogic, it also differed from Alfarabi's interpretation of that logic.\nAvicenna has, however, more consistently courteous ways of declining\nto follow Alfarabi. He refers to Alfarabi as the \u201ceminent later\nscholar to whom we are most concerned to direct our remarks\u201d as\nhe constructs his different system (see Street 2001).\nFor a general overview of Avicenna's logic, there is now an English\ntranslation of the logic of Avicenna's Salvation (see Avicenna\n2011a). But of all his many\n works,[12]\n it is Avicenna's Pointers and Reminders that had most \nimpact on subsequent generations of\nlogicians. It became, as Ibn Taymiyya declared, the Koran of the\nphilosophers (Michot 2000: 599). From it we may note a few broad but\ntypical differences from the Prior Analytics in the\nsyllogistic. First, the \u201cabsolute\u201d (mutlaqa,\noften translated \u201cassertoric\u201d) propositions have\ntruth-conditions stipulated such that they are temporally modalised (by\nan elided \u201cat least once\u201d, so that, for example, the contradictory of\nan absolute is not an absolute, absolute e-propositions do not convert,\nsecond-figure syllogisms with absolute\npremises are sterile; see also 2.3.1 below). Secondly, Avicenna begins\nto explore the logical properties of propositions of the form every\nJ is B while\nJ. Thirdly, Avicenna divides syllogistic into connective (iqtir\u00e2n\u00ee)\nand repetitive (istithn\u00e2\u2018\u00ee) forms, a division\nwhich replaces the old one into categorical and hypothetical (Avicenna\nal-Ish\u00e2r\u00e2t [1971] 309, 314, 374). \nAccording to what we\nhave verified ourselves, the syllogism forms two divisions, connective\nand repetitive. The\nconnective is that in which one of the two sides of the contradiction\nin which we find the conclusion does not appear [in the premises]\nexplicitly, but only potentially\u2026 The repetitive is that in\nwhich [the conclusion or its contradictory] does explicitly appear.\n(Avicenna al-Ish\u00e2r\u00e2t [1971] 374)\nAs\na rough guide, we may call a logician \u201cAvicennan\u201d if he\nadopts these doctrines. Pointers was not the only important\nAvicennan text in later Arabic logic: post-Avicennan logicians mined\nthe Cure's volume on the Prior Analytics\nfor the syllogistic with conditional premises, a syllogistic which they\nmodified perhaps even more than they modified Avicenna's modal syllogistic\n(see Kh\u00fbnaj\u00ee 2010: section 10; see also El-Rouayheb's\nIntroduction, xlv\u2013xlviii).\n",
