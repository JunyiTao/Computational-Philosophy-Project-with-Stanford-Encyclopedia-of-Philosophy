    "preamble": "\n\nIn its broadest definition, \u201ccivic education\u201d means all\nthe processes that affect people\u2019s beliefs, commitments,\ncapabilities, and actions as members or prospective members of\ncommunities. Civic education need not be intentional or deliberate;\ninstitutions and communities transmit values and norms without meaning\nto. It may not be beneficial: sometimes people are civically educated\nin ways that disempower them or impart harmful values and goals. It is\ncertainly not limited to schooling and the education of children and\nyouth. Families, governments, religions, and mass media are just some\nof the institutions involved in civic education, understood as a\nlifelong\n process.[1]\n A rightly famous example is Tocqueville\u2019s often quoted\nobservation that local political engagement is a form of civic\neducation: \u201cTown meetings are to liberty what primary schools\nare to science; they bring it within the people\u2019s reach, they\nteach men how to use and how to enjoy it.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, most scholarship that uses the phrase \u201ccivic\neducation\u201d investigates deliberate programs of instruction\nwithin schools or colleges, in contrast to paideia (see\nbelow) and other forms of citizen preparation that involve a whole\nculture and last a lifetime. There are several good reasons for the\nemphasis on schools. First, empirical evidence shows that civic habits\nand values are relatively easily to influence and change while people\nare still young, so schooling can be effective when other efforts to\neducate citizens would fail (Sherrod, Flanagan, and Youniss, 2002).\nAnother reason is that schools in many countries have an explicit\nmission to educate students for citizenship. As Amy Gutmann points\nout, school-based education is our most deliberate form of human\ninstruction (1987, 15). Defining the purposes and methods of civic\neducation in schools is a worthy topic of public debate. Nevertheless,\nit is important not to lose sight of the fact that civic education\ntakes place at all stages of life and in many venues other than\nschools.\n\nWhether defined narrowly or broadly, civic education raises empirical\nquestions: What causes people to develop durable habits, values,\nknowledge, and skills relevant to their membership in communities? Are\npeople affected differently if they vary by age, social or cultural\nbackground, and starting assumptions? For example, does a high school\ncivics course have lasting effects on various kinds of students, and\nwhat would make it more effective? \n\nFrom the 1960s until the 1980s, empirical questions concerning civic\neducation were relatively neglected, mainly because of a prevailing\nassumption that intentional programs would not have significant\nand durable effects, given the more powerful influences of social\nclass and ideology (Cook, 1985). Since then, many research studies and\nprogram evaluations have found substantial effects, and most social\nscientists who study the topic now believe that educational practices,\nsuch as discussion of controversial issues, hands-on action, and\nreflection, can influence students (Sherrod, Torney-Purta &\nFlanagan, 2010).\n\nThe philosophical questions have been less explored, but they are\nessential. For example:\n\n\n\nWho has the full rights and obligations of a citizen? This question is\nespecially contested with regard to children, immigrant aliens, and\nindividuals who have been convicted of felonies. \n\n\nIn what communities ought we see ourselves as citizens? The\nnation-state is not the only candidate; some people see themselves as\ncitizens of local geographical communities, organizations, movements,\nloosely-defined groups, or even the world as a whole.\n\n\nWhat responsibilities does a citizen of each kind of community have?\nDo all members of each community have the same responsibilities, or\nought there be significant differences, for example, between elders\nand children, or between leaders and other members?\n\n\nWhat is the relationship between a good regime and good citizenship?\nAristotle held that there were several acceptable types of regimes,\nand each needed different kinds of citizens. That makes the question\nof good citizenship relative to the regime-type. But other theorists\nhave argued for particular combinations of regime and citizen\ncompetence. For example, classical liberals endorsed regimes that\nwould make relatively modest demands on citizens, both because they\nwere skeptical that people could rise to higher demands and because\nthey wanted to safeguard individual liberty against the state. Civic\nrepublicans have seen a certain kind of citizenship--highly active and\ndeliberative--as constitutive of a good life, and therefore recommend\na republican regime because it permits good citizenship.\n\n\nWho may decide what constitutes good citizenship? If we consider, for\nexample, students enrolled in public schools in the United States,\nshould the decision about what values, habits, and capabilities they\nshould learn belong to their parents, their teachers, the children\nthemselves, the local community, the local or state government, or the\nnation-state? We may reach different conclusions when thinking about\n5-year-olds and adult college students. As Sheldon Wolin warned:\n\u201c\u2026[T]he inherent danger\u2026is that the identity given\nto the collectivity by those who exercise power will reflect the needs\nof power rather than the political possibilities of a complex\ncollectivity\u201d (1989, 13). For some regimes\u2014fascist or\ncommunist, for example\u2014this is not perceived as a danger at all\nbut, instead, the very purpose of their forms of civic education. In\ndemocracies, the question is more complex because public institutions\nmay have to teach people to be good democratic citizens, but they can\ndecide to do so in ways that reinforce the power of the state and\nreduce freedom.\n\n\nWhat means of civic education are ethically appropriate? It\nmight, for example, be effective to punish students who fail to\nmemorize patriotic statements, or to pay students for community\nservice, but the ethics of those approaches would be controversial. An\neducator might engage students in open discussions of current events\nbecause of a commitment to treating them as autonomous agents,\nregardless of the consequences. As with other topics, the proper\nrelationship between means and ends is contested.\n\n\nThese questions are rarely treated together as part of comprehensive\ntheories of civic education; instead, they arise in passing in works\nabout politics or education. Some of these questions have never been\nmuch explored by professional philosophers, but they arise frequently\nin public debates about citizenship.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. The Good Citizen: Historical Conceptions\n\n\u201cAs far back as evidence can be found\u2014and virtually\nwithout exception\u2014young adults seem to have been less attached\nto civic life than their parents and\n grandparents.\u201d[2]\n That is not evidence of decline--although it is often read as\nsuch--but rather indicates that becoming a citizen is a developmental\nprocess. It must be taught and learned. Most if not all societies\nrecognize a need to educate youth to be \u201ccivic-minded\u201d;\nthat is, to think and care about the welfare of the community (the\ncommonweal or civitas) and not simply about their own\nindividual well-being. Sometimes, civic education is also intended to\nmake all citizens, or at least prospective leaders, effective\nas citizens or to reduce disparities in political power by giving\neveryone the knowledge, confidence, and skills they need to\nparticipate. This section briefly introduces several conceptions of\ncivic education that have been influential in the history of the\n West.[3]\n\n1.1 Ancient Greece\n\nThe ancient Greek city state or polis was thought to be an educational\ncommunity, expressed by the Greek term paideia. The purpose\nof political\u2014that is civic or city\u2014life was the\nself-development of the citizens. This meant more than just education,\nwhich is how paideia is usually translated. Education for the\nGreeks involved a deeply formative and life-long process whose goal\nwas for each person (read: man) to be an asset to his friends, to his\nfamily, and, most important, to the polis.\n\nBecoming such an asset necessitated internalizing and living up to the\nhighest ethical ideals of the community. So paideia included\neducation in the arts, philosophy and rhetoric, history, science, and\nmathematics; training in sports and warfare; enculturation or learning\nof the city\u2019s religious, social, political, and professional\ncustoms and training to participate in them; and the development of\none\u2019s moral character through the virtues. Above all, the person\nshould have a keen sense of duty to the city. Every aspect of Greek\nculture in the Classical Age\u2014from the arts to politics and\nathletics\u2014was devoted to the development of personal powers in\npublic service.\n\nPaideia was inseparable from another Greek concept:\narete or excellence, especially excellence of reputation but\nalso goodness and excellence in all aspects of life. Together\npaideia and ar\u00eate form one process of\nself-development, which is nothing other than civic-development. Thus\none could only develop himself in politics, through participation in\nthe activities of the polis; and as individuals developed the\ncharacteristics of virtue, so would the polis itself become more\nvirtuous and excellent.\n\nAll persons, whatever their occupations or tasks, were teachers, and\nthe purpose of education\u2014which was political life\nitself\u2014was to develop a greater (a nobler, stronger, more\nvirtuous) public community. So politics was more than regulating or\nordering the affairs of the community; it was also a\n\u201cschool\u201d for ordering the lives\u2014internal and\nexternal\u2014of the citizens. Therefore, the practice of Athenian\ndemocratic politics was not only a means of engendering good policies\nfor the city, but it was also a \u201ccurriculum\u201d for the\nintellectual, moral, and civic education of her citizens.\n\u201c\u2026[A]sk in general what great benefit the state derives\nfrom the training by which it educates its citizens, and the reply\nwill be perfectly straightforward. The good education they have\nreceived will make them good men\u2026\u201d (Plato, Laws,\n641b7\u201310). Indeed, later in the Laws the Athenian\nremarks that education should be designed to produce the desire to\nbecome \u201cperfect citizens\u201d who know, preceding Aristotle,\n\u201chow to rule and be ruled\u201d (643e4\u20136).\n1.2 Classical Liberalism\n\nAncient and medieval thinkers generally assumed that good government\nand good citizenship were intimately related, because a regime would\ndegenerate unless its people actively and virtuously supported it.\nAristotle regarded his Politics and his Ethics as\npart of the same subject. In his view, a city-state could not be just\nand strong unless its people were virtuous, and men could not exercise\nthe political virtues (which were intrinsically admirable, dignified,\nand satisfying) unless they lived in a just polity. Civic virtue was\nespecially important in a democratic or mixed regime, but even in a\nmonarchy or oligarchy, people were expected to sustain the political\ncommunity. \n\nToday, the view that the best life is one of active participation in a\ncommunity that relies on and encourages active engagement is often\ncalled \u201ccivic republicanism,\u201d and it has been developed by\nauthors like Wolin (1989), Barber (1992) and Hannah Arendt.\n\nClassical liberal thinkers, however, saw serious drawbacks to making\ngood government dependent on widespread civic virtue. First, any\ndemanding and universal system of moral education would be\nincompatible with individual freedom. If, for example the state forced\npeople to enroll their children in public schools in order to create\ngood citizens, it would hamper parents and young people\u2019s\nindividual freedom.\n\nThe second problem was more practical. States did not have a very good\nrecord of producing moral virtue in rulers or subjects. Mandatory\nchurch membership, state-subsidized education, and even public\nspectacles of torture and execution did not reliably prevent\ncorruption, sedition and other private behavior injurious to the\ncommunity. \n\nThomas Hobbes is sometimes described as a forerunner of liberalism\n(despite his advocacy of absolute monarchy) because he held a dim view\nof human nature and thought that the way to prevent political disaster\nwas to design the government right, not to try to improve civic\nvirtue. He also held that a good government was one that permitted\npeople to live their own lives safely. Another strong critic of the\nidea that a good society depended on civic virtue was Bernard\nMandeville, who wrote a famous 1705 poem entitled, \u201cThe Fable of\nThe Bees: or, Private Vices, Public Benefits.\u201d Mandeville argued\nthat a good society could arise from sheer individual self-interest if\nit was organized appropriately. \n\nOther classical liberal thinkers typically favored some degree of\ncivic education and civic virtue, even as they proposed limitations on\nthe state and a strong private sphere to reduce the dependence of the\nregime on civic virtue. In other words, they steered a middle course\nbetween pure classical liberalism and civic republicanism. For\nexample, in his \u201cInstructions for the conduct of a young\nGentleman, as to religion and government,\u201d John Locke wrote that\na gentleman\u2019s \u201cproper calling is the service of his\ncountry, and so is most properly concerned in moral and political\nknowledge; and thus the studies which more immediately belong to his\ncalling are those which treat of virtues and vices, of civil society\nand the arts of government, and will take in also law and\nhistory.\u201d That was an argument for civic education. But it\nappeared in a minor, unpublished fragment. Civic education was not a\nsignificant theme in Locke\u2019s important treatise Some Thoughts\nConcerning Education, which was more about teaching individuals to\nbe free and responsible in their private lives. Likewise, the emphasis\nof his political writing was on limiting the power of the state and\nprotecting private rights.\n\nJames Madison hoped for some degree of civic virtue in the people and\nespecially in their representatives. He endorsed \u201cthe great\nrepublican principle, that the people will have the virtue and\nintelligence to select men of virtue and wisdom. Is there no virtue\namong us? If there be not, we are in a wretched situation. No\ntheoretical checks--no form of government can render us secure\u201d\n(Madison, 1788, 11:163) On the other hand, Madison proposed a whole\nseries of reforms that would make government proof against the various\nvices that seemed to be \u201csown in the nature of man\u201d\n(Madison, Hamilton, and Jay, Federalist 10). These tools included\nconstitutional limitations on the overall power and scope of\ngovernment; independent judges with power of review; elections with\nrelatively broad franchise; and above all, checks and balances. \n\nMadison explained that republics should be designed for people of\nmoderate virtue, such as might be found in real societies.\n\u201cIf men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels\nwere to govern men, neither external nor internal controuls on\ngovernment would be necessary.\u201d Unfortunately, neither citizens\nnor rulers could be counted on to act like angels; but good government\nwas possible anyway, as long as the constitution provided appropriate\ncontrols. \n\nThe main \u201cexternal controul\u201d in a republic was the vote,\nwhich made powerful men accountable to those they ruled. However,\nvoting was not enough, especially since the voters themselves might\nlack virtue and wisdom. \u201cA dependence on the people is no doubt\nthe primary controul on the government; but experience has taught\nmankind the necessity of auxiliary precautions.\u201d In general,\nMadison\u2019s \u201cauxiliary precautions\u201d involved dividing\npower among separate institutions and giving them the ability to check\none another.\n\nThis policy of supplying by opposite and rival interests, the defect\nof better motives, might be traced through the whole system of human\naffairs, private as well as public. We see it particularly displayed\nin all the subordinate distributions of power; where the constant aim\nis to divide and arrange the several offices in such a manner as that\neach may be a check on the other; that the private interest of every\nindividual may be a centinel over the public rights. These inventions\nof prudence cannot be less requisite in the distribution of the\nsupreme powers of the state. (Madison, Hamilton, and Jay, Federalist\n51)\n\n1.3 Rousseau: Toward Progressive Education\n\nAlthough ancient Athens instituted democracy, her most famous\nphilosophers\u2014Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle\u2014were not great\nchampions of it. At best they were ambiguous about democracy; at\nworst, they were hostile toward it. The earliest unadulterated\nchampion of democracy, a \u201cdreamer of democracy,\u201d was\nundoubtedly Rousseau. Yet Rousseau had his doubts that men could be\ngood men and simultaneously good citizens. A good man for Rousseau is\na natural man, with the attributes of freedom, independence, equality,\nhappiness, sympathy, and love-of-self (amour de soi) found\nprior to society in the state of nature. Thus society could do little\nbut corrupt such a man.\n\nStill, Rousseau recognized that life in society is unavoidable, and so\ncivic education or learning to function well in society is also\nunavoidable. The ideal for Rousseau is for men to act morally and yet\nretain as much of their naturalness as possible. Only in this way can\na man retain his freedom; and only if a man follows those rules that\nhe prescribes for himself\u2014that is, only if a man is\nself-ruling\u2014can he remain free: \u201c\u2026[E]ach\nindividual\u2026obeys no one but himself and remains as free as\nbefore [society]\u201d (1988, 60).\n\nYet prescribing those rules is not a subjective or selfish act. It is\na moral obligation because the question each citizen asks himself or\nshould ask himself was not \u201cWhat\u2019s best for me?\u201d\nRather, each asks, \u201cWhat\u2019s best for all?\u201d When all\ncitizens ask this question and answer on the basis of what ought to be\ndone, then, says Rousseau, they are expressing and following the\ngeneral will. Enacting the general will is the only legitimately moral\nfoundation for a law and the only expression of moral freedom. Getting\nmen to ask this question and to answer it actively is the purpose of\ncivic education.\n\nShowing how to educate men to retain naturalness and yet to function\nin society and participate untouched by corruption in this direct\ndemocracy was the purpose of his educational treatise, Emile.\nIf it could be done, Rousseau would show us the way. To do it\nwould seem to require educating a man to be in society but\nnot of society; that is, to be \u201cattached to human\nsociety as little as possible\u201d (Ibid, 105).\n\nHow could a man for Rousseau be a good man\u2014meaning, for him a\nnaturally good man (1979, 93), showing his amour de soi and\nalso his natural compassion for others\u2014and also have the proper\nframe of mind of a good citizen to be able to transcend self-interest\nand prescribe the general will? How could this be done in society when\nsociety\u2019s influence is nothing but corrupting?\n\nRousseau himself seems ambivalent on exactly whether men can overcome\nsocial corruption. Society is based on private property; private\nproperty brings inequality, as some own more than others; such\ninequality brings forth social comparisons with others (amour\npropre), which in turn can produce envy, pride, and greed. Only\nwhen and if men can exercise their moral and political freedom and\nwill the general will can they be saved from the corrupting influences\nof society. Willing for the general will, which is the good for all,\nis the act of a moral or good person. Its exercise in the assembly is\nthe act of a good citizen.\n\nStill, Rousseau comments that if \u201c[f]orced to combat nature or\nthe social institutions, one must choose between making a man or a\ncitizen, for one cannot make both at the same time\u201d (Ibid, 39).\nThere seems little, if any, ambiguity here. One cannot make both a man\nand a citizen at the same time. Yet on the very next page of\nEmile Rousseau raises the question of whether a man who\nremains true to himself, to his nature, and is always decisive in his\nchoices \u201cis a man or a citizen, or how he goes about being both\nat the same time\u201d (Ibid, 40).\n\nPerhaps the contradiction might be resolved if we emphasize that a man\ncannot be made a man and a citizen at the\nsame time, but he can be a man and a citizen\nat the same time. Rousseau hints at this distinction when he says of\nhis educational scheme that it avoids the \u201ctwo contrary\nends\u2026the contrary routes\u2026these different\nimpulses\u2026[and] these necessarily opposed objects\u201d (Ibid,\n40, 41) when you raise a man \u201cuniquely for himself.\u201d What,\nthen, will he be for others? He will be a man and a citizen, for the\n\u201cdouble object we set for ourselves,\u201d those contradictory\nobjects, \u201ccould be joined in a single one by removing the\ncontradictions of man\u2026\u201d (Idem). Doubtless, this will be a\nrare man, but raising a man to live a natural life can be done.\n\nOne might find the fully mature, and natural, Emile an abhorrent\nperson. Although \u201cgood\u201d in the sense of doing his duty and\nacting civilly, he seems nevertheless without imagination or deep\ncuriosity about people or life itself\u2014no interest in art or many\nbooks or intimate social relationships. Is his independence fear of\ndependence and thus built on an inability ever to be interdependent?\nIs he truly independent, or does he exhibit simply the appearance of\nindependence, while the tutor \u201cremains master of his\nperson\u201d (Ibid, 332)?\n\nWhatever one thinks of Rousseau\u2019s attempt to educate\nEmile\u2014whether, for example, the tutor\u2019s utter control of\nEmile\u2019s life and environment is not in itself a betrayal of\neducation\u2014Rousseau is a precursor of those progressive educators\nwho seek to permit children to learn at their own rate and from their\nown experiences, as we shall see below.\n1.4 Mill: Education Through Political Participation\n\nMill argued that participation in representative government, or\ndemocracy, is undertaken both for its educative effects on\nparticipants and for the beneficial political outcomes. Even if\nelected or appointed officials can perform better than citizens, Mill\nthought it advisable for citizens to participate \u201cas a means to\ntheir own mental education\u2014a mode of strengthening their active\nfaculties, exercising their judgment, and giving them a familiar\nknowledge of the subjects with which they are thus left to deal. This\nis a principal, though not the sole, recommendation of jury trial; of\nfree and popular local and municipal institutions; of the conduct of\nindustrial and philanthropic enterprises by voluntary\nassociations\u201d (1972, 179). Thus, political participation is a\nform of civic education good for men and for citizens.\n\nOn Liberty, the essay in which the above quotation appears,\nis not, writes Mill, the occasion for developing this idea as it\nrelates to \u201cparts of national education.\u201d But in\nMill\u2019s view the development of the person can and should be\nundertaken in concert with an education for citizens. The\n\u201cmental education\u201d he describes is \u201cin truth, the\npeculiar training of a citizen, the practical part of the political\neducation of a free people, taking them out of the narrow circle of\npersonal and family selfishness, and accustoming them to the\ncomprehension of joint interests, the management of joint\nconcerns\u2014habituating them to act from public or semi-public\nmotives, and guide their conduct by aims which unite instead of\nisolating them from one another\u201d (Idem).\n\nThe occasion for discussing civic education as a method of both\npersonal and political development is Mill\u2019s Considerations\non Representative Government. Mill wants to see persons\n\u201cprogress.\u201d To achieve progress requires \u201cthe\npreservation of all kinds and amounts of good which already exist, and\nProgress as consisting in the increase of them.\u201d Of what does\nMill\u2019s good consist? First are \u201cthe qualities in the\ncitizens individually which conduce most to keep up the amount of good\nconduct\u2026Everybody will agree that those qualities are industry,\nintegrity, justice, and prudence\u201d (1972, 201). Add to these\n\u201cthe particular attributes in human beings which seem to have a\nmore especial reference to Progress\u2026They are chiefly the\nqualities of mental activity, enterprise, and courage\u201d (Ibid,\n202).\n\nSo, progress is encouraged when society develops the qualities of\ncitizens and persons. Mill tells us that good government depends on\nthe qualities of the human beings that compose it. Men of virtuous\ncharacter acting in and through justly administered institutions will\nstabilize and perpetuate the good society. Good persons will be good\ncitizens, provided they have the requisite political institutions in\nwhich they can participate. Such participation\u2014as on juries and\nparish offices\u2014takes participants out of themselves and away\nfrom their selfish interests. If that does not occur, if persons\nregard only their \u201cinterests which are selfish,\u201d then,\nconcludes Mill, good government is impossible. \u201c\u2026[I]f the\nagents, or those who choose the agents, or those to whom the agents\nare responsible, or the lookers-on whose opinion ought to influence\nand check all these, are mere masses of ignorance, stupidity, and\nbaleful prejudice, every operation of government will go wrong\u201d\n(Ibid, 207).\n\nFor Mill good government is a two-way street: Good government depends\non \u201cthe virtue and intelligence of the human beings composing\nthe community\u201d; while at the same time government can further\n\u201cpromote the virtue and intelligence of the people\nthemselves\u201d (Idem). A measure of the quality of any political\ninstitution is how far it tends \u201cto foster in the members of the\ncommunity the various desirable qualities\u2026moral, intellectual,\nand active\u201d (Ibid, 208). Good persons act politically as good\ncitizens and are thereby maintained or extended in their goodness.\n\u201cA government is to be judged by its actions upon men\u2026by\nwhat it makes of the citizens, and what it does with them; its\ntendency to improve or deteriorate the people themselves.\u201d\nGovernment helps people advance, acts for the improvement of the\npeople, \u201cis at once a great influence acting on the human\nmind\u2026.\u201d Government is, then, \u201can agency of national\neducation\u2026\u201d (Ibid, 210, 211).\n\nFollowing Tocqueville, Mill saw political participation as the basis\nfor this national education. \u201cIt is not sufficiently considered\nhow little there is in most men\u2019s ordinary life to give any\nlargeness either to their conceptions or to their sentiments.\u201d\nTheir work is routine and dull; they proceed through life without much\ninterest or energy. On the other hand, \u201cif circumstances allow\nthe amount of public duty assigned him to be considerable, it makes\nhim an educated man\u201d (Ibid, 233). In this way participation in\ndemocratic institutions \u201cmust make [persons] very different\nbeings, in range of ideas and development of faculties, from those who\nhave done nothing in their lives but drive a quill, or sell goods over\na counter\u201d (Idem).\n\nThere was no national public schooling in Mill\u2019s Great Britain,\nand there were clearly lots of Britons without the requisite\ncharacteristics either of good citizens or of good men. Mill was\ncertainly aware of this. He was much influenced by Tocqueville\u2019s\nwritings on the tyranny of the majority. Mill feared, as did\nTocqueville, that the undereducated or uneducated would dominate and\ntyrannize politics so as to undermine authority and individuality.\nBeing ignorant and inexperienced, the uneducated and undereducated\nwould be susceptible to all manner of demagoguery and manipulation. So\ntoo much power in the hands of the inept and ignorant could damage\ngood citizenship and dam the course of self-development. To remedy\nthis Mill proposed two solutions: limit participation and provide the\ncompetent and educated with plural votes.\n\nIn Mill\u2019s \u201cideally best polity\u201d the highest levels\nof policymaking would be reserved for nationally elected\nrepresentatives and for experts in the civil service. These\nrepresentatives and experts would not only carry out their political\nduties, but they would also educate the public through debate and\ndeliberation in representative assemblies, in public forums, and\nthrough the press. To assure that the best were elected and for the\nsake of rational government, Mill provided plural votes to those with\ncollege educations and to those of certain occupations and training.\nAll citizens (but the criminal and illiterate) could vote, but not all\ncitizens would vote equally. Some citizens, because they were educated\nor highly trained persons, were \u201cbetter\u201d than others:\n\u201c\u2026[T]hough every one ought to have a voice\u2014that\nevery one should have an equal voice is a totally different\nproposition\u2026No one but a fool\u2026feels offended by the\nacknowledgment that there are others whose opinion, and even whose\nwish, is entitled to a greater amount of consideration than his\u201d\n(Ibid, 307\u20138).\n\nBut education was the great leveling factor. Though not his view when\nhe wrote Considerations on Representative Government, Mill\nwrote in his autobiography that universal education could make plural\nvoting unnecessary (1924, pp. 153, 183\u201384). Mill did acknowledge\nin Representative Government that a national system of\neducation or \u201ca trustworthy system of general examination\u201d\nwould simplify the means of ascertaining \u201cmental\nsuperiority\u201d of some persons over others. In their absence, a\nperson\u2019s years of schooling and nature of occupation would\nsuffice to determine who would receive plural votes (1972,\n308\u201309). Given Mill\u2019s prescriptions for political\nparticipation and given the lessons learned from the deliberations and\ndebates of representatives and experts, however, it is doubtful that\ncivic education would have constituted much of his national\neducation.\n1.5 Early Civic Education in the United States\n\nAs\n noted above\n the founders of the United States tried to reduce the burdens on\ncitizens, because they observed that republics had generally collapsed\nfor lack of civic \n virtue.[4]\n However, they also created a structure that\nwould demand more of citizens, and grant citizens more rights, than\nthe empire from which they had declared independence. So virtually all\nof the founders advocated greater attention to civic education. When\nAlexander Hamilton wrote in Federalist 23 that the federal\ngovernment ought to be granted \u201can unconfined authority in\nrespect to all those objects which are entrusted to its\nmanagement\u201d (1987, p. 187), he underscored the need of the newly\norganized central government for, in Sheldon Wolin\u2019s words,\n\u201ca new type of citizen\u2026one who would accept the\nattenuated relationship with power implied if voting and elections\nwere to serve as the main link between citizens and those in\n power.\u201d[5]\n Schools would be entrusted to develop this new type of citizen.\n\nIt is commonplace, therefore, to find among those who examine the\ninterstices of democracy and education views much like Franklin Delano\nRoosevelt\u2019s: \u201cThat the schools make worthy citizens is the\nmost important responsibility placed on them.\u201d In the United\nStates public schools had the mission of educating the young for\ncitizenship.\n\nInitially education in America was not publicly funded. It\nwasn\u2019t even a system, however inchoate. Instead it was every\ncommunity for itself. Nor was it universal education. Education was\nrestricted to free white males and, moreover, free white males who\ncould afford the school fees. One of the \u201cfounders\u201d of the\npublic-school system in the United States, even though his era\npredated the establishment of public schools, was Noah Webster, who\nsaw education as the tool for developing a national identity. As a\nresult, he created his own speller and dictionary as a way of\nadvancing a common American language.\n\nOpposed to this idea of developing a national identity was Thomas\nJefferson, who saw education as the means for safeguarding individual\nrights, especially against the intrusions of the state. Central to\nJefferson\u2019s democratic education were the \u201cliberal\narts.\u201d These arts liberate men and women (though Jefferson was\nthinking only of men) from the grip of both tyrants and demagogues and\nenable those liberated to rule themselves. Through his ward system of\neducation, Jefferson proposed establishing free schools to teach\nreading, writing, and arithmetic, and from these schools those of\nintellectual ability, regardless of background or economic status,\nwould receive a college education paid for by the state.\n\nWhen widespread free or publicly funded education did come to America\nin the 19th century, it came in the form of Horace\nMann\u2019s \u201ccommon school.\u201d Such schools would educate\nall children together, \u201cin common,\u201d regardless of their\nbackground, religion, or social standing. Underneath such fine\nsentiments lurked an additional goal: to ensure that all children\ncould flourish in America\u2019s democratic system. The civic\neducation curriculum was explicit, if not simplistic. To create good\ncitizens and good persons required little beyond teaching the basic\nmechanics of government and imbuing students with loyalty to America\nand her democratic ideals. That involved large amounts of rote\nmemorization of information about political and military history and\nabout the workings of governmental bodies at the local, state, and\nfederal levels. It also involved conformity to specific rules\ndescribing conduct inside and outside of school.\n\nThrough this kind of civic education, all children would be melded, if\nnot melted, into an American citizen. A heavy emphasis on\nProtestantism at the expense of Catholicism was one example of such\nwork. What some supporters might have called\n\u201cassimilation\u201d of foreigners into an American way of life,\ncritics saw as \u201chomogenization,\u201d\n\u201cnormalization,\u201d and \u201cconformity,\u201d if not\n\u201cuniformity.\u201d With over nine million immigrants coming to\nAmerica between 1880 and the First World War, it is not surprising\nthat there was resistance by many immigrant communities to what seemed\ninsensitivity to foreign language and culture. Hence what developed\nwas a system of religious\u2014namely Catholic\u2014education\nseparate from the \u201cpublic school\u201d system.\n\nWhile Webster and, after him, Mann wanted public education to generate\nthe national identity that they thought democracy required, later\neducational reformers moved away from the idea of the common school\nand toward a differentiation of students. The Massachusetts Commission\non Industrial and Technical Education, for example, pushed in 1906 for\nindustrial and vocational education in the public schools. Educating\nall youth equally for participation in democracy by giving them a\nliberal, or academic, education, they argued, was a waste of time and\nresources. \u201cSchool reformers insisted that the academic\ncurriculum was not appropriate for all children, because most\nchildren\u2014especially the children of immigrants and of African\nAmericans\u2014lacked the intellectual capacity to study subjects\nlike algebra and chemistry\u201d (Ravitch, 2001, 21).\n\nActing against this view of education was John Dewey. Because Dewey\nsaw democracy as a way of life, he argued that all children deserved\nand required a democratic\n education.[6]\n As citizens came to share in the interests of others, which they\nwould do in their schools, divisions of race, class, and ethnicity\nwould be worn down and transcended. Dewey thought that the actual\ninterests and experiences of students should be the basis of their\neducation. I recur to a consideration of Dewey and civic education\nbelow.\n2. The Good Democrat\n\nCivic education can occur in all kinds of regimes, but it is\nespecially important in democracies. In The Politics, Aristotle\nasks whether there is any case \u201cin which the excellence of the\ngood citizen and the excellence of the good man coincide\u201d\n(1277a13\u201315). The answer for him is a politea or a mixed\nconstitution in which persons must know both how to rule and how to\nobey. In such regimes, the excellence and virtues of the good man and\nthe good citizen coincide. Democratic societies have an interest in\npreparing citizens to rule and to be ruled. \n\nModern democracies, however, are different from the ancient polis in\nseveral important and pertinent respects. They are mass societies in\nwhich most people can have little individual impact on government and\npolicy. They are complex, technologically-driven, highly specialized\nsocieties in which professionals (including lawyers, civil servants,\nand politicians) have much more expertise than laypeople. And they are\nliberal constitutional regimes in which individual freedom is\nprotected--to various degrees--and government is deliberately\ninsulated from public pressure. For example, courts and central banks\nare protected from popular votes. Once the United States had become an\nindustrialized mass society, the influential columnist Walter Lippmann\nargued that ordinary citizens had been eclipsed and could, at most,\nrender occasional judgments about a government of experts (see The\nPhantom Public, 1925). John Dewey and the Chicago civic leader\nJane Addams (in different ways) asserted that the lay public must and\ncould regain its voice, but they struggled to explain how.\n2.1 The State, Parents, and Children in Liberal Democracies\n\nSeveral contemporary philosophers argue that citizens have a\nrelatively demanding role and that they can and should be educated for\nit. Gutmann (1987), for example, argues that democratic\nsociety-at-large has a significant stake in the education of its\nchildren, for they will grow up to be democratic citizens. At the very\nleast, then, society has the responsibility for educating all children\nfor citizenship. Because democratic societies have this\nresponsibility, we cannot leave the education of future citizens to\nthe will or whim of parents. This central insight leads Gutmann to\nrule out certain exclusive suzerainties of power over educational\ntheory and policy. Those suzerainties are of three sorts. First is\n\u201cthe family state\u201d in which all children are educated into\nthe sole good life identified and fortified by the state. Such\neducation cultivates \u201ca level of like-mindedness and camaraderie\namong citizens\u201d that most persons find only in families (Ibid,\n23).  Only the state can be entrusted with the authority to mandate\nand carry out an education of such magnitude that all will learn to\ndesire this one particular good life over all others.\n\nNext is \u201cthe state of families\u201d that rests on the impulse\nof families to perpetuate their values through their children. This\nstate \u201cplaces educational authority exclusively in the hands of\nparents, thereby permitting parents to predispose their children,\nthrough education, to choose a way of life consistent with their\nfamilial heritage\u201d (Ibid, 28).\n\nFinally, Gutmann argues against \u201cthe state of\nindividuals,\u201d which is based on a notion of liberal neutrality\nin which both parents and the state look to educational experts to\nmake certain that no way of life is neglected nor discriminated\nagainst. The desire here is to avoid controversy, and to avoid\nteaching virtues, in a climate of social pluralism. Yet, as Gutmann\npoints out, any educational policy is itself a choice that will shape\nour children\u2019s character. Choosing to educate for freedom rather\nthan for virtue is still insinuating an influential choice.\n\nIn light of these three theories that fail to provide an adequate\nfoundation for educational authority, Gutmann proposes \u201ca\ndemocratic state of education.\u201d This state recognizes that\neducational authority must be shared among parents, citizens, and\neducational professionals, because each has a legitimate interest in\neach child and the child\u2019s future. Whatever our aim of\neducation, whatever kind of education these authorities argue for, it\nwill not be, it cannot be, neutral. Needed is an educational aim that\nis inclusive. Gutmann settles on our inclusive commitment as\ndemocratic citizens to conscious social reproduction, the\nself-conscious shaping of the structures of society. To actuate this\ncommitment we as a society \u201cmust educate all educable children\nto be capable of participating in collectively shaping their\nsociety\u201d (Ibid, 14).\n\nTo shape the structures of society, to engage in conscious social\nreproduction, students will need to develop the capacities for\nexamining and evaluating competing conceptions of the good life and\nthe good society, and society must avoid the inculcation \u201cin\nchildren [of the] uncritical acceptance of any particular way or ways\nof [personal and political] life\u201d (Ibid, 44). This is the crux\nof Gutmann\u2019s democratic education. For this reason, she argues\nforcefully that children must learn to exercise critical deliberation\namong good lives and, presumably, good societies. To assure that they\ncan do so, limits must be set for when and where parents and the state\ncan interfere. Guidelines must be introduced that limit the political\nauthority of the state and the parental authority of families. One\nlimit is nonrepression, which assures that neither the state nor any\ngroup within it can \u201crestrict rational deliberation of competing\nconceptions of the good life and the good society\u201d (Idem). In\nthis way, adults cannot use their freedom to deliberate to prohibit\nthe future deliberative freedom of children. Furthermore, claims\nGutmann, nonrepression requires schools to support \u201cthe\nintellectual and emotional preconditions for democratic deliberation\namong future generations of citizens\u201d (Ibid, 76.)\n\nThe second limit is nondiscrimination, which prevents the state or\ngroups within the state from excluding anyone or any group from an\neducation in deliberation. Thus, as Gutmann says, \u201call educable\nchildren must be educated\u201d (Ibid, 45).\n\nGutmann\u2019s point is not that the state has a greater interest\nthan parents in the education of our children. Instead, her point is\nthat all citizens of the state have a common interest in educating\nfuture citizens. Therefore, while parents should have a say in the\neducation of their children, the state should have a say as well. Yet\nneither should have the final, or a monopolistic, say. Indeed, these\ntwo interested parties should also cede some of their educational\nauthority to educational experts. There is, therefore, a collective\ninterest in schooling, which is why Gutmann finds parental\n\u201cchoice\u201d and voucher programs unacceptable.\n\nBut is conscious social reproduction the only aim of education? What\nabout shaping one\u2019s private concerns? Isn\u2019t educating the\nyoung to be good persons also important? Or are the skills that\nencourage citizen participation also the skills necessary for making\npersonal life choices and personal decision-making? For Gutmann,\neducating for one is also educating for the other:\n\u201c\u2026[M]any if not all of the capacities necessary for\nchoice among good lives are also necessary for choice among good\nsocieties\u201d (p. 40). She goes even further: \u201ca good life\nand a good society for self-reflective people require (respectively)\nindividual and collective freedom of choice\u201d (Idem). Here\nGutmann is stipulating that to have conscious social reproduction\ncitizens must have the opportunity\u2014the freedom and the\ncapacities\u2014to exercise personal or self-reflective choice.\n\nBecause the state is interested in the education of future citizens,\nall children must develop those capacities necessary for choice among\ngood societies; this is simply what Gutmann means by being able to\nparticipate in conscious social reproduction. Yet such capacities also\nenable persons to scrutinize the ways of life that they have\ninherited. Thus, Gutmann concludes, it is illegitimate for any parent\nto impose a particular way of life on anyone else, even on his/her own\nchild, for this would deprive the child of the capacities necessary\nfor citizenship as well as for choosing a good life.\n\nGutmann\u2019s position is that government can and must force one to\nparticipate in an education for citizenship. Children must be exposed\nto ways of life different from their parents\u2019 and must embrace\ncertain values such as mutual respect. On this last point Gutmann is\ninsistent. She argues that choice is not meaningful, for anyone,\nunless persons choosing have \u201cthe intellectual skills necessary\nto evaluate ways of life different from that of their parents.\u201d\nWithout the teaching of such skills as a central component of\neducation children will not be taught \u201cmutual respect among\npersons\u201d (Ibid, 30\u201331). \u201cTeaching mutual respect is\ninstrumental to assuring all children the freedom to choose in the\nfuture\u2026[S]ocial diversity enriches our lives by expanding our\nunderstanding of differing ways of life. To reap the benefits of\nsocial diversity, children must be exposed to ways of life different\nfrom their parents and\u2014in the course of their\nexposure\u2014must embrace certain values, such as mutual respect\namong persons\u2026\u201d (Ibid, 32\u201333).\n\nYet what Gutmann suggests seems to go beyond seeing diversity as\nenrichment. She suggests that children not simply tolerate ways of\nlife divergent from their own, but that they actually respect them.\nShe is careful to say \u201cmutual respect among persons,\u201d\nwhich can only mean that neo-Nazis, while advocating an execrable way\nof life, must be respected as persons, though their way of life should\nbe condemned. Perhaps this is a subtlety that Gutmann intended, but\nWilliam Galston, for one, has come away thinking that Gutmann\nadvocates forcing children to confront their own ways of life as they\nsimultaneously show respect for neo-Nazis.\n\nIn our representative system, argues Galston, citizens need to develop\n\u201cthe capacity to evaluate the talents, character, and\nperformance of public officials\u201d (1989, p. 93). This, he says,\nis what our democratic system demands from citizens. Thus he disagrees\nwith Gutmann, so much so that he says, \u201cIt is at best a partial\ntruth to characterize the United States as a democracy in\nGutmann\u2019s sense\u201d (Ibid, p. 94). We do not require\ndeliberation among our citizens, says Galston, because\n\u201crepresentative institutions replace direct self-government for\nmany purposes\u201d (Idem). Civic education, therefore, should not be\nabout teaching the skills and virtues of deliberation, but, instead,\nabout teaching \u201cthe virtues and competences needed to select\nrepresentatives wisely, to relate to them appropriately, and to\nevaluate their performance in office soberly\u201d (Idem).\n\nBecause civic education is limited in scope to what Galston outlines\nabove, students will not be expected, and will not be taught, to\nevaluate their own ways of life. Persons must be able to lead the\nkinds of lives they find valuable, without fear that they will be\ncoerced into believing or acting or thinking contrary to their values,\nincluding being led to question those ways of life that they have\ninherited. As Galston points out, \u201c[c]ivic tolerance of deep\ndifferences is perfectly compatible with unswerving belief in the\ncorrectness of one\u2019s own way of life\u201d (Ibid, p. 99).\n\nSome parents, for example, are not interested in having their children\nchoose ways of life. Those parents believe that the way of life that\nthey currently follow is not simply best for them but is best\nsimpliciter. To introduce choice is simply to confuse the\nchildren and the issue. If you know the true way to live, is it best\nto let your children wade among diverse ways of life until they can\npossibly get it right? Or should you socialize the children into the\nright way of life as soon and as quickly as possible?\n\nYet what about the obligations that parents, as citizens, and children\nas future citizens, owe the state? How can children be prepared to\nparticipate in collectively shaping society if they have not received\nan education in how to deliberate about choices? To this some parents\nmight respond that they are not interested in having their children\nfocus on participation, or perhaps on anything secular. What these\nparents appreciate about liberal democracy is that there is a clear,\nand firm, separation between public and private, and they seek to\nfocus exclusively on the private. Citizenship offers protections of\nthe law, and it does not require participation. Liberal democracy\ncertainly will not force one to participate.\n\nYet both Galston and Gutmann want to educate children for\n\u201cdemocratic character.\u201d Both see the need in this respect\nfor critical thinking. For Galston children must develop \u201cthe\ncapacity to evaluate the talents, character, and performance of public\nofficials\u201d; Gutmann seeks to educate the capacities necessary\nfor choice among good lives and for choice among good societies.\nHowever much critical thinking plays in democratic character, active\nparticipation requires something more than mere skills, even thinking\nskills.\n\nYet both Galston and Gutmann want to educate children for\n\u201cdemocratic character.\u201d Both see the need in this respect\nfor critical thinking. For Galston children must develop \u201cthe\ncapacity to evaluate the talents, character, and performance of public\nofficials\u201d; Gutmann seeks to educate the capacities necessary\nfor choice among good lives and for choice among good societies.\nHowever much critical thinking plays in democratic character, active\nparticipation requires something more than mere skills, even thinking\nskills.\n2.2 Social Capital\n\nThe concept of \u201csocial capital\u201d was introduced by the\nsociologist James S. Coleman to refer to the value that is inherent in\nsocial networks (see, e.g., Coleman, 1988). The political scientist\nRobert Putnam subsequently argued that democracies function well in\nproportion to the strength of their social capital (1994) and that\nsocial capital is declining in the United States (2000). In his book\nBowling Alone, Putnam explains, \u201cWhereas physical capital\nrefers to physical objects and human capital refers to properties of\nindividuals [such as their own skills], social capital refers to\nconnections among individuals\u2014social networks and the norms of\nreciprocity and trustworthiness that arise from them. In that sense\nsocial capital is closely related to what some have called\n\u2018civic virtue.\u2019 The difference is that \u2018social\ncapital\u2019 calls attention to the fact that civic virtue is most\npowerful when embedded in a dense network of reciprocal social\nrelations\u201d (Putnam 2000, p. 19).\n\nA related idea is \u201ccollective efficacy,\u201d as developed by\nthe sociologist Robert Sampson and colleagues. It is the use--or\nability to use--social networks to address common problems, such as\ncrime. Sampson finds that the level of collective efficacy strongly\npredicts the quality of life in communities (Sampson, 2012).\n\nIf governments and communities function much better when people have\nsocial networks and use them for public purposes, then civic education\nbecomes important and it is substantially about teaching people to\ncreate, appreciate, preserve, and use social networks. A pedagogical\napproach like\n Service Learning\n (see below) might be most promising for that purpose.\n\nElinor Ostrom won the 2009 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for her\nwork on how people overcome collective action problems, such as the\nPrisoner\u2019s Dilemma and the Tragedy of the Commons. These\nproblems are endemic and serious, sometimes leading to environmental\ncatastrophe and war. Ostrom, however, discovered many principles that\nallow people to overcome such problems. She wrote,\n\nAt any time that individuals may gain from the costly action of\nothers, without themselves contributing time and effort, they face\ncollective action dilemmas for which there are coping methods. When de\nTocqueville discussed the \u2018art and science of\nassociation,\u2019 he was referring to the crafts learned by those\nwho had solved ways of engaging in collective action to achieve a\njoint benefit. Some aspects of the science of association are both\ncounterintuitive and counterintentional, and thus must be taught to\neach generation as part of the culture of a democratic citizenry.\n(Ostrom 1998)\n\n\nOstrom believed that these principles could be taught explicitly and\nformally, but the traditional and most effective means for teaching\nthem were experiential. She argued that the tendency to centralize and\nprofessionalize management throughout the 20th century had deprived\nordinary people of opportunities to learn from experience, and thus\nour capacity to address collective action problems had weakened.\n\nAlong with her husband Vincent Ostrom, Elinor Ostrom developed the\nidea of polycentric governance, according to which we are citizens of\nmultiple, overlapping, and nested communities, from the smallest\nneighborhoods to the globe. Collective action problems are best\naddressed polycentrically, not reserved for national governments or\nparceled out neatly among levels of government. As president of the\nAmerican Political Science Association and in other prominent roles,\nOstrom advocated civic education that would teach people to address\ncollective action problems in multiple settings and scales.\n2.3 Deliberative Democracy\n\nDeliberative democracy is the idea that a legitimate political\ndecision is one that results from discussions among citizens under\nreasonably favorable conditions. Proponents debate precisely what\nqualifies as deliberation, but there is a general agreement that the\ndiscussion should be inclusive, free, equitable, and in some sense\ncivil. In practical terms, deliberative democracy implies various\nefforts to increase the amount and the impact of public discussions.\nThe philosophical underpinnings derive from the work of influential\ntheorists including J\u00fcrgen Habermas, John Rawls, Michael Sandel,\nand others of varying views. See Gutmann and Thompson (1996) for an\nexample of a sophisticated treatment that draws on many earlier\nworks.\n\nFor civic education, the implication of deliberative democracy is that\npeople should learn to participate in discussions, which may be both\nface-to-face and \u201cmediated\u201d by the news media and social\nmedia. Concretely, that means that people should develop the aptitude,\ndesire, knowledge, and skills that lead them to read and discuss the\nnews and current events with diverse fellow citizens and influence the\ngovernment with the views that they develop and refine by\ndeliberation. Practices such as discussing and debating current events\nin school seem especially promising. \n2.4 Public Work\n\nHarry C. Boyte (1996, 2004) argues for the centrality of work\nto citizenship. We are not only citizens when we vote, read and\ndiscuss the news, and volunteer after school or work--which are all\nunpaid, voluntary activities. We are also citizens on the job; and\neven when we perform unpaid service, we should see our contributions\nas work-like in the sense that they are serious business. Citizens do\nnot merely monitor and influence the government (per the theory of\ndeliberative democracy) nor serve other people in community settings\n(emphasized in the idea of social capital); they also literally build,\nmake, and maintain public goods. They do so whether they work in the\npublic, private, or nonprofit sectors, for pay or not. Of course, they\ncan work either well or badly, and a good citizen is one who\nmakes valuable contributions to the public good, or builds \u201cthe\ncommonwealth.\u201d\n\nThe theory of public work suggests that civic education should be\nhighly experiential and closely related to vocational education. Young\npeople should gain skills and agency by actually making things\ntogether. A good outcome is an individual who will be able to\ncontribute to the commonwealth through her or his work. Albert Dzur\n(2008), who holds a kindred but not identical view, emphasizes the\nimportance of revising professional education so that professionals\nlearn to collaborate better with laypeople.\n3. The Good Person\n\nThe qualities of the good citizen are not simply the skills necessary\nto participate in the political system. They are also the virtues that\nwill lead one to participate, to want to participate, to have a\ndisposition to participate. This is what Rousseau was referring to\nwhen he described how citizens in his ideal polity would \u201cfly to\nthe assemblies\u201d (1988, 140). Citizens, that is, ought to display\na certain kind of disposition or character. As it turns out, and not\nsurprisingly, given our perspective, in a democracy the virtues or\ntraits that constitute good citizenship are also closely associated\nwith being a good or moral person. We can summarize that close\nassociation as what we mean by the phrase \u201cgood\ncharacter.\u201d\n\nIt is the absence of these virtues or traits\u2014that is, the\nabsence of character\u2014that leads some to conclude that democracy,\nespecially in the United States, is in crisis. The withering of our\ndemocratic system, argues Richard Battistoni, for one, can be traced\nto \u201ca crisis in civic education\u201d and the failure of our\neducators to prepare citizens for democratic participation (1985, pp.\n4\u20135). Missing, he argues, is a central character trait, a\ndisposition to participate. Crucial to the continuation of our\ndemocracy \u201cis the proper inculcation in the young of the\ncharacter, skills, values, social practices, and ideals that foster\ndemocratic politics\u201d (Ibid, p. 15); in other words, educating\nfor democratic character.\n3.1 Good Persons and Good Citizens\n\nTwo groups predominate in advocating the use of character education as\na way of improving democracy. One group comprises political theorists\nsuch as Galston, Battistoni, Benjamin Barber, and Adrian Oldfield who\noften reflect modern-day versions of civic republicanism. This group\nwishes to instill or\n nurture[7]\n a willingness among our future citizens to sacrifice their\nself-interests for the sake of the common good. Participation on this\nview is important both to stabilize society and to enhance each\nindividual\u2019s human flourishing through the promotion of our\ncollective welfare.\n\nThe second group does not see democratic participation as the center,\nbut instead sees democratic participation as one aspect of overall\ncharacter education. Central to the mission of our public schools, on\nthis view, is the establishing of character traits important both to\nindividual conduct (being a good person) and to a thriving democracy\n(being a good citizen). The unannounced leader of the second group is\neducational practitioner Thomas Lickona, and it includes such others\nas William Bennett and Patricia White.\n\nNeither group describes in actual terms what might be called\n\u201cdemocratic character.\u201d Though their work intimates such\ncharacter, they talk more about character traits important to human\ngrowth and well-being, which also happen to be related to democratic\nparticipation. What traits do these pundits discuss, and what do they\nmean by \u201ccharacter\u201d?\n\nIt is difficult, comments British philosopher R. S. Peters, \u201cto\ndecide what in general we mean when we speak of a person\u2019s\ncharacter as distinct from his nature, his temperament, and his\npersonality\u201d (1966, p. 40). Many advocates of character\neducation are vague on just this distinction, and it might be helpful\nto propose that character consists of traits that are learned, while\npersonality and temperament consist of traits that are\n innate.[8]\n\nWhat advocates are clear on, however, is that character is the essence\nof what we are. The term comes from the world of engraving, from the\nGreek term kharakter, an instrument used for making\ndistinctive marks. Thus character is what marks a person or persons as\ndistinctive.\n\nCharacter is not just one attribute or trait. It signifies the sum\ntotal of particular traits, the \u201csum of mental and moral\nqualities\u201d (O.E.D., p. 163). The addition of\n\u201cmoral qualities\u201d to the definition may be insignificant,\nfor character carries with it a connotation of \u201cgood\u201d\ntraits. Thus character traits are associated, if not synonymous, with\nvirtues. So a good person and, in the context of liberal democracy, a\ngood citizen will have these virtues.\n\nTo Thomas Lickona a virtue is \u201ca reliable inner disposition to\nrespond to situations in a morally good way\u201d (p. 51);\n\u201cgood character,\u201d he continues, \u201cconsists of knowing\nthe good, desiring the good, and doing the good\u201d (Idem). Who\ndetermines what the good is? In general, inculcated traits or virtues\nor dispositions are used \u201cin following rules of conduct.\u201d\nThese are the rules that reinforce social conventions and social order\n(Peters, p. 40). So in this view social convention determines what\n\u201cgood\u201d means.\n\nThis might be problematic. What occurs when the set of virtues of the\ngood person clashes with the set of virtues of the good citizen? What\nis thought to be good in one context, even when approved by society,\nis not necessarily what is thought to be good in another. Should the\nonly child of a deceased farmer stay at home to care for his ailing\nmother, or should he, like a good citizen, join the resistance to\nfight an occupying army?\n\nWhat do we do when the requirements of civic education call into\nquestion the values or beliefs of what one takes to be the values of\nbeing a good person? In Mozert v. Hawkins County Board of\nEducation just such a case occurred. Should the Mozerts and other\nfundamentalist Christian parents have the right to opt their children\nout of those classes that required their children to read selections\nthat went against or undermined their faith? On the one hand, if they\nare permitted to opt out, then without those children present the\nclass is denied the diversity of opinion on the reading selections\nthat would be educative and a hallmark of democracy. On the other\nhand, if the children cannot opt out, then they are denied the right\nto follow their faith as they think\n necessary.[9]\n3.2 Spectrum of Virtues\n\nWe can see, therefore, why educating for character has never been\nstraightforward. William Bennett pushes for the virtues of patriotism,\nloyalty, and national pride; Amy Gutmann wants to see toleration of\ndifference and mutual respect. Can a pacifist in a time of war be a\npatriot? Is the rebel a hero or simply a\n troublemaker?[10]\n Can idealized character types speak to all of our students and to the\nvariegated contexts in which they will find themselves?\n\nShould our teachers teach a prescribed morality, often closely linked\nto certain religious ideas and ideals? Should they teach a content\nonly of secular values related to democratic character? Or should they\nteach a form of values clarification in which children\u2019s moral\npositions are identified but not criticized?\n\nThese two approaches\u2014a prescribed moral content or values\nclarification\u2014appear to form the two ends of a character\neducation spectrum. At one end is the method of indoctrination of\nprescribed values and virtues, regardless of sacred or secular\norientation. But here some citizens will express concern about just\nwhose values are to be taught or, to some,\n imposed.[11]\n At the same time, some will see the inculcation of specified values\nand virtues as little more than teaching a \u201cmorality of\ncompliance\u201d (Nord, 2001, 144).\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum is values\n clarification,[12]\n but this seems to be a kind of moral relativism where everything goes\nbecause nothing can be ruled out. In values clarification there is no\nright or wrong value to hold. Indeed, teachers are supposed to be\nvalue neutral so as to avoid imposing values on their students and to\navoid damaging students\u2019 self-esteem. William Damon calls this\napproach \u201canything-goes constructivism\u201d (1996), for such a\nposition may leave the door open for students to approve racism,\nviolence, and \u201cmight makes right.\u201d\n\nIs there a middle of the spectrum that would not impose values or\nsimply clarify values? There is no middle path that can cut a swath\nthrough imposition on one side and clarification on the other. Perhaps\nthe closest we can get is to offer something like Gutmann\u2019s or\nGalston\u2019s teaching of critical thinking. Here students can think\nabout and think through what different moral situations require of\npersons. With fascists looking for hiding Jews, I lie; about my\nwife\u2019s new dress, I tell the truth (well, usually). Even\ncritical thinking, however, requires students to be critical about\nsomething. That is, we must presuppose the existence, if not prior\ninculcation, of some values about which to be critical.\n\nWhat we have, then, is not a spectrum but a sequence, a developmental\nsequence. Character education, from this perspective, begins with the\ninculcation in students of specific values. But at a later date\ncharacter education switches to teaching and using the skills of\ncritical thinking on the very values that have been inculcated.\n\nThis approach is in keeping with what William Damon, an expert on\ninnovative education and on intellectual and moral development, has\nobserved: \u201cThe capacity for constructive criticism is an\nessential requirement for civic engagement in a democratic society;\nbut in the course of intellectual development, this capacity must\nbuild upon a prior sympathetic understanding of that which is being\ncriticized\u201d (2001, 135).\n\nThe process, therefore, would consist of two phases, two developmental\nphases. Phase One is the indoctrination phase. Yet which values do we\ninculcate? Perhaps the easiest way to begin is to focus first on those\nbehaviors that all students must possess. In fact, without first\ninsisting that students \u201cbehave,\u201d it seems problematic\nwhether students could ever learn to think critically. Every school,\nin order to conduct the business of education, reinforces certain\nvalues and behaviors. Teachers demand that students sit in their\nseats; raise their hands before speaking; hand assignments in on time;\ndisplay sportsmanship on the athletic field; be punctual when coming\nto class; do not cheat on their tests or homework; refrain from\nattacking one another on the playground, in the hallways, or in the\nclassroom; be respectful of and polite to their elders (e.g.,\nteachers, staff, administrators, parents, visitors, police); and the\nlike. The teachers\u2019 commands, demands, manner of interacting\nwith the students, and own conformity to the regulations of the\nclassroom and school establish an ethos of behavior\u2014a way of\nconducting oneself within that institution. From the ethos come the\nrequisite virtues\u2014honesty, cooperation, civility, respect, and\nso\n on.[13]\n\nAnother set of values to inculcate at this early stage is that\nassociated with democracy. Here the lessons are more didactic than\nbehavioral. One point of civic education in a democracy is to raise\nfree and equal citizens who appreciate that they have both rights and\nresponsibilities. Students need to learn that they have freedoms, such\nas those found in Bill of Rights (press, assembly, worship, and the\nlike) in the U. S. Constitution. But they also need to learn that they\nhave responsibilities to their fellow citizens and to their country.\nThis requires teaching students to obey the law; not to interfere with\nthe rights of others; and to honor their country, its principles, and\nits values. Schools must teach those traits or virtues that conduce to\ndemocratic character: cooperation, honesty, toleration, and\nrespect.\n\nSo we inculcate in our students the values and virtues that our\nsociety honors as those that constitute good citizenship and good\ncharacter. But if we inculcate a love of justice, say, is it the\njustice found in our laws or an ideal justice that underlies all laws?\nObviously, this question will not arise in the minds of most, if any,\nfirst graders. As students mature and develop cognitively, however,\nsuch questions will arise. So a high-school student studying American\nHistory might well ask whether the Jim Crow laws found in the South\nwere just laws simply because they were the law. Or were they only\njust laws until they were discovered through argument to be unjust? Or\nwere they always unjust because they did not live up to some ideal\nconception of justice?\n\nThen we could introduce Phase Two of character education: education in\njudgment. Judgment is based on weighing and considering reasons and\nevidence for and against propositions. Judgment is a virtue that\nrelies upon practical wisdom; it is established as a habit through\npractice. Judgment, or thoughtfulness, was the master virtue for\nAristotle from whose exercise comes an appreciation for those other\nvirtues: honesty, cooperation, toleration, and respect.\n\nBecause young children have difficulty taking up multiple\nperspectives, as developmental psychologists tell us, thinking and\ndeliberating that require the consideration of multiple perspectives\nwould seem unsuitable for elementary-school children. Additionally,\nyoung children are far more reliant on the teacher\u2019s involvement\nin presenting problem situations in which the children\u2019s\nknowledge and skills can be applied and developed. R. S. Peters offers\nan important consideration in this regard:\n\nThe cardinal function of the teacher, in the early stages, is to get\nthe pupil on the inside of the form of thought or awareness with which\nhe is concerned. At a later stage, when the pupil has built into his\nmind both the concepts and the mode of exploration involved, the\ndifference between teacher and taught is obviously only one of degree.\nFor both are participating in the shared experience of exploring a\ncommon world (1966, 53).\n\n\nThe distinction between those moving into \u201cthe inside\u201d of\nreflective thinking and those already there may seem so vast as to be\na difference of kind, not degree. But the difference is always one of\ndegree. Elementary-school students have yet to develop the skills and\nknowledge, or have yet to gain the experience, to participate in\nphase- two procedures that require perspectivism.\n\nIn this two-phased civic education teachers inculcate specific virtues\nsuch as patriotism. But at a later stage this orientation toward\nsolidifying a conventional perspective gives way to one of critical\nthinking. The virtue of patriotism shifts from an indoctrinated\nfeeling of exaltation for the nation, whatever its actions and\nmotives, to a need to examine the nation\u2019s principles and\npractices to see whether those practices are in harmony with those\nprinciples. The first requires loyalty; the second, judgment. We teach\nthe first through pledges, salutes, and oaths; we teach the second\nthrough critical inquiry.\n\nHave we introduced a significant problem when we teach students to\njudge values, standards, and beliefs critically? Could this approach\nlead to students\u2019 contempt for authority and tradition? Students\nneed to see and hear that disagreement does not necessarily entail\ndisrespect. Thoughtful, decent people can disagree. To teach students\nthat those who disagree with us in a complicated situation like\nabortion or affirmative action are wrong or irresponsible or weak is\nto treat them unfairly. It also conveys the message that we think that\nwe are infallible and have nothing to learn from what others have to\nsay. Such positions undercut democracy.\n\nWould all parents approve of such a two-phased civic education? Would\nthey abide their children\u2019s possible questioning of their\nfamilies\u2019 values and religious views? Yet the response to such\nparental concerns must be the same as that to any authority figure:\nWhy do you think that you are always right? Aren\u2019t there times\nwhen parents can see that it is better to lie, maybe even to their\nchildren, than to tell the truth? This, however, presupposes that\nparents, or authority figures, are themselves willing to exercise\ncritical judgment on their own positions, values, and behaviors. This\npoint underscores the need to involve other social institutions and\npersons in character education.\n4. Modern Forms of Civic Education\n\nIn the United States, most students are required to take courses on\ngovernment or civics, and the main content is essentially political\nscience for high school students. In other words, they use textbooks\nand other written materials to learn about the formal structure and\nbehavior of political institutions, from local government to the\nUnited Nations (Godsay et al., 2012). The philosophical justifications\nfor this kind of curriculum are rarely developed fully, but probably\nan underlying idea is that citizens ought to play certain concrete\nroles--voting, monitoring the news, serving on juries, petitioning the\ngovernment--and to do so effectively requires a baseline understanding\nof the political system. Another implicit goal may be to increase\nyoung people\u2019s appreciation of the existing constitutional\nsystem so that they will be motivated to preserve it.\n\nMichael Rebell (2018) argues that both the United States Constitution\nand most states\u2019 constitutional provisions regarding public\neducation provide support for a right to adequate civic\neducation. Specific policies should result from a deliberative\nprocess to define the educational opportunities that all students must\nreceive and to select appropriate outcomes for civic education \u2013\nall overseen by a court concerned with assessing whether civic\neducation is constitutionally \"adequate.\"\n\nState standards are regulatory documents that affect the curriculum in\npublic schools. All 50 states and the District of Columbia have\nadopted standards for civics as part of social studies (Godsay et al,\n2012). The  College, Career, and Civic Life (\"C3\") Framework for\nSocial Studies State Standards (National Council for the Social\nStudies, 2013) provides a general framework for states to use as they\ndesign or revise these standards. It organizes civics \u2013 along\nwith history, geography and economics \u2013 into one \"Inquiry Arc\"\nthat extends from \"Developing Questions and Planning Inquiries,\" to\n\"Applying Disciplinary Concepts and Tools,\" to \"Evaluating Sources and\nEvidence,\" to \"Communicating Conclusions and Taking Informed Action.\"\nThe Arc is presented as applicable from kindergarten through high\nschool, but with increasingly demanding content. The logic of moving\nfrom question-generation to (ultimately) action suggests an implicit\ntheory of civic engagement.\n\nIn the subsequent sections, we examine some proposals for alternative\nforms of civic education that are also philosophically\ninteresting.\n4.1 Service Learning\n\nPutting students into the community-at-large is today called\n\u201cservice-learning.\u201d It is a common form of civic education\nthat integrates classroom instruction with work within the community.\nIdeally, the students take their experience and observations from\nservice into their academic work, and use their academic research and\ndiscussions to inform their service.\n\nJerome Bruner, the renowned educator and psychologist, proposed that\nsome classroom learning ought to be devoted to students creating\npolitical-action plans addressing significant social and political\nissues such as poverty or race. He also urged educators to get their\nstudents out into the local communities to explore the occupations,\nways of life, and habits of residence. Bruner is here following Dewey,\nwho criticized traditional education for its failure to get teachers\nand students out into the community to become intimately familiar with\nthe physical, historical, occupational, and economic conditions that\ncould then be used as educational resources (Dewey 1938, 40). Dewey\nwarned of the \u201cstanding danger that the material of formal\ninstruction will be merely the subject matter of the schools, isolated\nfrom the subject matter of life experience.\u201d This could be\ncountered by immersing students in \u201cthe spirit of\nservice,\u201d especially by learning about the various occupations\nwithin their communities (1916, 10\u201311,\n 49).[14]\n\nEmpirical evidence suggests that experiential education may be most\neffective for civic learning. \u201cThe reason, again, is that\nstudents respond to experiences that touch their emotions and senses\nof self in a firsthand way\u201d (Damon, 2001, 141). Also, as Conover\nand Searing point out, \u201cwhile most students identify themselves\nas citizens, their grasp of what it means to act as citizens is\nrudimentary and dominated by a focus on rights, thus creating a\nprivately oriented, passive understanding\u201d (2000, 108). To bring\nthem out of this private and passive understanding, nothing is better,\nas Tocqueville noted, than political participation. The kind of\nparticipation here is political action, not simply voting or giving\nmoney. William Damon concludes that the most effective moral education\nprograms \u201care those that engage students directly in action,\nwith subsequent opportunities for reflection\u201d (2001, 144).\n\nAnother influence on service-learning is the theory of social capital,\ndescribed above. If a democracy depends on people serving one another\nand developing habits and networks of reciprocal concern--and if that\nkind of interaction is declining in a country like the United\nStates--then it is natural to encourage or require students to serve\nas part of their learning. \n4.2 Action Civics\n\nSome critics (e.g., Boyte and Kari, 1996) worry that the\n\u201cservice\u201d in \u201cservice-learning\u201d reflects a\nnarrow conception of citizenship that overlooks power and agency and\nthat encourages an undemocratic distinction between the server and the\nserved.\n\nWe can think of civic action as participation that involves far more\nthan serving, voting, working or writing a letter to the editor. It\ncan take many other forms: attending and participating in political\nmeetings; organizing and running meetings, rallies, protests, fund\ndrives; gathering signatures for bills, ballots, initiatives, recalls;\nserving on local elected and appointed boards; starting or\nparticipating in political clubs; deliberating with fellow citizens\nabout social and political issues central to their lives; and pursuing\ncareers that have public value.\n\nThe National Action Civics Collaborative (NACC) unites organizations\nthat engage students in civic action as a form of civic learning.\nService is usually only one form of \u201caction.\u201d Some NACC\nmembers work in schools, but similar practices are perhaps more common\nand easier to achieve in independent, community-based organizations.\nYouth Organizing is a widespread practice that engages adolescents in\ncivic or political activities. Levinson (2012) offers a\nphilosophically sophisticated defense of a pedagogy that she calls\n\u201cguided experiential civic education\u201d and argues for its\nplace in public schools.\n4.3 Civic Education through Discussion\n\nEspecially if one\u2019s theory of democracy is deliberative (see\n section 2.3, above),\n the core of civic education may be learning to talk and listen with\nother people about public problems. That is a cognitively and\nethically demanding activity that can be learned from experience. The\nmost promising pedagogy is to discuss current events with a\nmoderator--usually the teacher--and some requirement to prepare in\nadvance. \n\nDebates are competitive discussions. Simulations (such as mock trials\nor the Model UN) involve discussing issues from the perspective of\nfictional or historical characters. And deliberations usually involve\nstudents speaking in their own real voice and trying to find common\nground. \n\nConsiderable evidence shows that moderated discussions of current,\ncontroversial issues increase students\u2019 knowledge of civic\nprocesses, their skills at engaging with other people, and their\ninterest in politics. See, e.g., Kawashima-Ginsberg and Levine\n(2014). \n\nHess (2009) and Hess & McAvoy (2014) argue for discussing current\ncontroversies and explore some of the ethical dilemmas that arise for\nteachers who do so. For instance, should a teacher disclose her or his\nown views or attempt to conceal them to be a neutral moderator? What\nquestions should be presented as genuinely controversial? (Most people\nwould insist that slavery is no longer a controversy and should not be\ntreated as such. But what about the reality of climate change?)\n4.4 John Dewey: School as Community\n\nJohn Dewey argued that, from the 18th century onward,\nstates came to see education as the best means of perpetuating and\nrecovering their political power. But \u201cthe maintenance of a\nparticular national sovereignty required subordination of individuals\nto the superior interests of the state both in military defense and in\nstruggles for international supremacy in commerce\u2026To form the\ncitizen, not the \u2018man,\u2019 became the aim of education\u201d\n(1916, 90).\n\nIn a democracy, however, because of its combination of \u201cnumerous\nand more varied points of shared common interest\u201d and its\nrequirement of \u201ccontinuous readjustment through meeting the new\nsituations produced by varied intercourse,\u201d which Dewey called\n\u201cprogress,\u201d education could address personal development\nand \u201cfull and free interplay\u201d among social groups (Ibid,\n83, 79). In other words, it is in democratic states that we want to\nlook for the preparation of good persons as well as good citizens;\nthat is, for democratic education, which in this context, to repeat\nfor emphasis, is what is meant by civic education.\n\nNowhere is there a better site for political or democratic action than\nthe school itself, the students\u2019 own community. This is\nDewey\u2019s insight (1916). Creating a democratic culture within the\nschools not only facilitates preparing students for democratic\nparticipation in the political system, but it also fosters a\ndemocratic environment that shapes the relationships with adults and\namong peers that the students already engage in. \u201cStudents learn\nmuch more from the way a school is run,\u201d comments Theodore\nSizer, \u201cand the best way to teach values is when the school is a\nliving example of the values to be taught\u201d (1984, 120, 122).\n\nReal problems, and not hypotheticals or academic exercises, are, Dewey\nargued, always of real concern to students. So in addition to\nactivities of writing and classroom discussion, typical of\ntoday\u2019s public schools, students should engage in \u201cactive\ninquiry and careful deliberation in the significant and vital\nproblems\u201d that confront their communities, however defined but\nespecially their schools (1910, 55). Book lessons and classroom\ndiscussions rarely connect with decision-making on issues that affect\nthat community. In fact, Dewey comments that traditional methods of\ninstruction are often \u201cforeign to the existing capacities of the\nyoung\u2026beyond the reach of [their] experience\u2026[T]he very\nsituation forbids much active participation by pupils\u201d (1938,\n19).\n\nAs a core of learning Dewey wanted \u201can experiential\ncontinuum\u201d (1938, 28, 33). The experiences that he wanted to\npromote were those that underscored healthy growth; those, in other\nwords, that generated a greater desire to learn and to keep on\nlearning and that built upon prior experiences. \u201c[D]emocratic\nsocial experiences\u201d were superior in providing \u201ca better\nquality of human experience\u201d than any other form of social or\npolitical organization (Ibid, 34).\n\nOne logical, and practical, possibility was to make the operations of\nthe school part of the curriculum. Let the students use their\nin-school experiences to make, or help make, decisions that directly\naffect some of the day-to-day operations of the school\u2014student\ndiscipline, maintenance of the grounds and buildings, problems with\ncliques, issues of sexism and racism, incidents of ostracism, and the\nlike\u2014as well as topics and issues inside the classrooms.\n\nDewey thought of schools as \u201cembryo communities\u201d (1915,\n174), \u201cinstitution[s] in which the child is, for the\ntime\u2026to be a member of a community life in which he feels that\nhe participates, and to which he contributes\u201d (1916, 88). We\nneed not become sidetracked in questioning just what Dewey means by,\nor what we should mean by, \u201ccommunity\u201d to grasp the sense\nthat he is after. It is not surprising that Dewey wanted to give\nstudents experience in making decisions that affect their lives in\nschools. What is surprising is that so little democracy takes place in\nschools and that those who spend the most time in schools have the\nleast opportunity to experience it.\n\nThe significance of democratic decision-making within the schools and\nabout the wider community\u2014the making of actual decisions through\ndemocratic means\u2014cannot be overstated. As a propaedeutic to\ndemocratic participation, political action of this sort is invaluable.\nMelissa S. Williams comments: \u201c\u2026[L]earning cooperation as\na practice is the only way to develop individuals\u2019\nsense of agency to reshape the world they share with others. It\nteaches moderation in promoting one\u2019s own vision, and the\ncapacity of individuals to see themselves as part of a project of\ncollective self-rule\u201d (2005, 238; emphasis in original).\n\nOf course, not everything in school should be decided democratically.\nThere are some areas in which decisions require expertise\u2014a\ncombination of experience and knowledge\u2014that rules out students\nas decision-makers. Chief among such areas is pedagogy. Because the\nteachers and administrators know more about the processes of education\nand about their subjects, because they have firsthand and often\nintimate knowledge of the range and nature of abilities and problems\nof their students\u2014a point emphasized by Dewey (1938,\n56)\u2014as well as the particular circumstances in which the\nlearning takes place, they and not the students should make\npedagogical decisions.\n\nAt the same time, because many students are still children, the\ndecisions that they are to make should be age-appropriate. Not all\ndemocratic procedures or school issues are suitable for all ages.\nDifferences in cognitive, social, and emotional development,\nespecially at the elementary-school level, complicate democratic\naction. While all students may have the same capacity as potentiality,\nactivating those capacities requires development, as noted in the\ndiscussion of a two-phased form of civic education.\n\nDeweyan ideas about the school as a community live on in several kinds\nof practice. First, in some experimental schools, students, teachers,\nand parents actually govern democratically. In a Sudbury School (of\nwhich the first was founded in Sudbury, Massachusetts in 1968), the\nwhole community governs the institution through weekly town\nmeetings.\n\nMuch more common is to give students some degree of voice in the\ngovernance of a school through an elected student government,\nstudent-run media, and policies that encourage students to express\ntheir opinions.\n\nAnother very prevalent approach is to support and encourage students\nto manage their own voluntary associations within a school: clubs,\nteams, etc. Thomas & McFarland (2010) and others have found\npositive affects of extracurricular participation on voting, and a\nplausible explanation is that adolescents become active citizens by\nmanaging their own mini-communities.\n4.5 Liberation Pedagogy\n\nIn his critique of traditional pedagogy, Paulo Freire refers to\nteacher-centered education as the \u201cbanking concept of\neducation\u201d (1970, 72). This for Freire is unacceptable as civic\neducation. Too often, observes Freire, students are asked to memorize\nand repeat ideas, stanzas, phrases, and formulas without understanding\nthe meaning of or meaning behind them. This process \u201cturns\n[students] into \u2018containers,\u2019 into\n\u2018receptacles\u2019 to be \u2018filled\u2019 by the\nteacher\u201d (Idem). As a result, students are nothing but objects,\nnothing but receptacles to receive, file, and store\ndeposits\u2014that is, containers for what the teacher has deposited\nin their \u201cbanks.\u201d\n\nLike Dewey, Freire thinks that knowledge comes only from invention and\nreinvention and the perpetual inquiry in the world that is a mark of\nall free human beings. Students thereby educate the teachers as well.\nIn sharp contrast, then, to the banking concept is\n\u201c\u2018problem-posing\u2019 education\u201d (Ibid, 79), which\nis an experiential education that empowers students by educing the\npower that they already possess.\n\nThat power is to be used to liberate themselves from oppression. This\npedagogy to end oppression, as Freire writes, \u201cmust be forged\nwith, not for, the oppressed\u201d (1970, 48;\nemphases in original), irrespective of whether they are children or\nadults. Freire worked primarily with illiterate adult peasants in\nSouth America, but his work has applications as well to schools and\nschool-aged children. It is to be a pedagogy for all, and Freire\nincludes oppressors and the oppressed.\n\nTo overcome oppression people must first critically recognize its\ncauses. One cause is people\u2019s own internalization of the\noppressor consciousness [or \u201cimage,\u201d as Freire says at one\npoint (Ibid, 61)]. Until the oppressed seek to remove this\ninternalized oppressor, they cannot be free. They will continue to\nlive in the duality of both oppressed and oppressor. It is no wonder,\nthen, as Freire tells us, that peasants once promoted to overseers\nbecome more tyrannical toward their former workmates than the owners\nthemselves (Ibid, 46). The banking concept of education precludes the\nperspective that students need to recognize their oppression:\n\u201cThe more students [or adults] work at storing the deposits\nentrusted to them, the less they develop the critical consciousness\nwhich would result from their intervention in the world as\ntransformers of that world\u201d (Ibid, 73).\n\nHaving confronted the reality of the dual nature of her consciousness,\nhaving discovered her own internal oppressor and realized her actual\nsituation, the person now must act on her realization. She must act,\nin other words, in and on the world so as to lessen oppression. Freire\nwanted his students, whether adult peasants or a country\u2019s\nyouth, to value their cultures as they simultaneously questioned some\nof those cultures\u2019 practices and ethos. This Freire referred to\nas \u201creading the word\u201d\u2014as in ending\nilliteracy\u2014and \u201creading the world\u201d\u2014the ability\nto analyze social and political situations that influenced and\nespecially limited people\u2019s life chances. For Freire, to\nquestion was not enough; people must act as well.\n\nLiberation, therefore, is a \u201cpraxis,\u201d but it cannot\nconsist of action alone, which Freire calls \u201cactivism.\u201d It\nmust be, instead, action combined with \u201cserious\nreflection\u201d (Ibid, 79, 65). This reflection or \u201creflective\nparticipation\u201d takes place in dialogue with others who are in\nthe same position of realization and action.\n\nThis \u201ccritical and liberating dialogue,\u201d also known as\n\u201cculture circles,\u201d is the heart of Freire\u2019s\npedagogy. The circles consist of somewhere between 12 and 25 students\nand some teachers, all involved in dialogic exchange. The role of the\n\u201cteachers\u201d in this civic education is to participate with\nthe people/students in these dialogues. \u201cThe correct method for\na revolutionary leadership\u2026is, therefore, not\n\u2018libertarian propaganda.\u2019 Nor can the leadership merely\n\u2018implant\u2019 in the oppressed a belief in freedom\u2026The\ncorrect method lies in dialogue\u201d (Ibid, 67).\n\nThe oppressed thereby use their own experiences and language to\nexplain and surmount their oppression. They do not rely upon others,\neven teachers, to explain their oppressed circumstances.\n\u201cThrough dialogue, the teacher-of-the-students and the\nstudents-of the-teacher cease to exist and a new term emerges:\nteacher-student with students-teachers\u201d (Ibid, 80). The\nreciprocity of roles means that students teach teachers as teachers\nteach students. Dialogue encourages everyone to teach and everyone to\ncreate together.\n\nBecause Freire worked with illiterate adult peasants, he insisted that\nthe circles use the ways of speaking and the shared understandings of\nthe peasants themselves. In the circles the learners identify their\nown problems and concerns and seek answers to them in the group\ndialogue. Dialogue focuses on what Freire called\n\u201ccodifications,\u201d which are representations of the\nlearner\u2019s day-to-day circumstances (Ibid, 114 and passim).\nCodifications may be photographs, drawings, poems, even a single word.\nAs representations, codifications abstract the daily circumstances.\nFor example, a photograph of workers in a sugar cane field permits\nworkers to talk about the realities of their work and working\nconditions without identifying them as the actual workers in the\nphotograph. This permits the dialogue to steer toward understanding\nthe nature of the participants\u2019 specific circumstances but from\na more abstract position. Teachers and learners worked together to\nunderstand the problems identified by the peasants, a process that\nFreire calls \u201cdecoding,\u201d and to propose actions to be\ntaken to rectify or overturn those problems.\n\nThe circles therefore have four basic elements: 1) problem posing, 2)\ncritical dialogue, 3) solution posing, and 4) plan of action. The\ngoal, of course, is to overcome the problems, but it is also to raise\nthe awareness, the critical consciousness (conscientization), of the\nlearners so as to end oppression in their individual and collective\nlives. The increased critical awareness enables learners to\nappropriate language without being colonized by\n it.[15]\n Decoding allows participants \u201cto perceive reality\ndifferently\u2026by broadening the horizon of perception\u2026[It]\nstimulates the appearance of a new perception\u201d that allows for\nthe transformation of the participants\u2019 concrete reality (Ibid\n115).\n\n\u201cFinally,\u201d comments Freire, \u201ctrue dialogue cannot\nexist unless the dialoguers engage in critical\nthinking\u2026thinking which perceives reality as process, as\ntransformation, rather than as a static activity\u201d (Ibid,\n92).\n\nTrue dialogue is for Freire what civic education must be about. If\ncivic education does not include it, then there is little hope that\nthe future will be anything for the oppressed but a continuation of\nthe present. \u201cAuthentic education is not carried on by\n\u2018A\u2019 for \u2018B\u2019 or by \u2018A\u2019\nabout \u2018B,\u2019 but by \u2018A\u2019 with\n\u2018B\u2019\u2026\u201d (Ibid, 93; emphases in original).\nEssential to such education are the experiences of the students,\nwhatever their ages or situations. Naively conceived humanism, part\nand parcel of so much traditional education, tries \u201cto create an\nideal model of the \u2018good man,\u2019\u201d but does so by\nleaving out \u201cthe concrete, existential, present situation of\nreal people\u201d (Idem). Therefore, traditional civic education,\nnon-experiential civic education that overlooks the importance of\nFreire\u2019s praxis, fails for Freire to raise either good persons\nor good citizens.\n\nThe Brazilian government has recognized Freire\u2019s culture circles\nas a form of civic education and has underwritten their use for\ncombating illiteracy among youth and adults (Souto-Manning, 2007).\n5. Cosmopolitan Education\n\nCosmopolitanism is an emerging and, because of globalization, an\nincreasingly important topic for civic educators. In an earlier\niteration, cosmopolitan education was multicultural education.\nAccording to both, good persons need to be aware of the perspectives\nof others and the effects their decisions have on others. While\nmulticultural good citizens needed to think about the perspectives and\nplight of those living on the margins of their societies and about\nthose whose good lives deviated from their own, good citizens in\ncosmopolitanism need to think, or begin to think, of themselves as\n\u201cglobal citizens\u201d with obligations that extend across\nnational boundaries. Should and must civic education incorporate a\nglobal awareness and foster a cosmopolitan sensibility?\n\nMartha Nussbaum, for one, thinks so. Nussbaum argues that our first\nobligation must be to all persons, regardless of race, creed, class,\nor border. She does not mean that we ought to forsake our commitments\nto our family, friends, neighbors, and fellow citizens. She means that\nwe ought to do nothing in our other communities or in our lives that\nwe know to be immoral from the perspective of Kant\u2019s community\nof all humanity (1996, 7). We should \u201cwork to make all human\nbeings part of our community of dialogue and concern\u201d (Ibid, 9).\nCivic education should reflect that (Ibid, 11).\n\nPhilosopher Eamonn Callan, however, thinks otherwise. Callan wants to\navoid a civic education, and the pursuit of justice that underlies it,\n\u201cthat gives pride of place to a cosmopolitan sensibility at the\ncost of particularistic affiliations\u201d (1999, p. 197). In\nCallan\u2019s view our civic education should be constructed ideally\naround the concept of \u201cliberal patriotism.\u201d Although\nliberal patriotism is an \u201cidentification with a particular,\nhistorically located project of political self-rule\u201d\u2014that\nis, American liberal democracy\u2014it nevertheless also\n\u201centails a sense of responsibility to outsiders and insiders\nalike\u2026.\u201d (Ibid, 198).\n\nOf course, the danger here is that a liberal patriot may well feel a\nsense of obligation or responsibility only when her country\nis committing the injustice. Callan points out that it is\n\u201cprecisely the thought that \u2018we Americans\u2019 have done\nthese terrible things that gave impetus [during the Vietnam war] to\ntheir horror and rage\u201d (Idem). This thought is to be contrasted\nwith our feelings and sense of responsibility when, as Callan\nsuggests, Soviet tanks rolled through Prague. Because, according to\nCallan, our politico-moral identity was not implicated in the Soviet\naction, we somehow do not have to have a similar sense of horror and\nrage. Perhaps we do not have to, but should we? Nussbaum\u2019s point\nis that we certainly should.\n\nWhat, therefore, should civic education look like? Callan provides two\nexamples: Should we \u201ccultivate a civic identity in which\npatriotic affinities are muted or disappear altogether and a\ncosmopolitan ideal of \u2018world citizenship\u2019 is\nbrought\u201d to the forefront? Or should we cultivate a kind of\npatriotism \u201cin which identification with a particular project of\ndemocratic self-rule is yet attuned to the claims of justice that both\ncivic outsiders and insiders\u201d will make (1999, 198). It appears\nthat Nussbaum would favor the first, while Callan favors the\nsecond.\n\nPerhaps these two are not the only options. In her metaphor of\nconcentric identity circles Nussbaum argues that we ought to try to\nbring the outer circles of our relationships, the circle of all\nhumanity, closer to the center, to our selves and to our loved ones\n(1996, 9). By doing so, we do not push out of our identities those\nparticular relationships of significance to us. Instead, we need to\ntake into consideration the effects that our moral and political\ndecisions have on all of humanity. If our civic education helps us\nextend our sympathies, as Hume proposed, and if we could do so without\npaying the price of muting or eliminating our local and national\naffinities, then would Nussbaum and Callan agree on such a civic\neducation?\n\nAdditionally, we need to consider that patriotism itself seems to have\nits own version of concentric circles. For example, Theodore Roosevelt\nwarned against \u201cthat overexaltation of the little community at\nthe expense of the great nation.\u201d Here is a nod toward\nRoosevelt\u2019s \u201cNew Nationalism\u201d as opposed to what he\ncalled \u201cthe patriotism of the\n village.\u201d[16]\n If we move from the village to the nation, then can\u2019t we move\nfrom the nation to the world? As Alexander Pope wrote in \u201cAn\nEssay on Man\u201d: \u201cGod loves from Whole to Parts; but human\nsoul/Must rise from Individual to the Whole/\u2026Friend, parent,\nneighbor first it will embrace/His country next, and next all human\nrace.\u201d\n\nIs it ever too early to begin educating children about the cultures,\ncustoms, values, ideas, and beliefs of people from around the world?\nWill this undercut our commitment and even devotion to our own family,\nneighborhood, region, and nation? No civic education must consist\nexclusively either of love of one\u2019s community and a patriotic\naffiliation with one\u2019s country or of preparation for world\ncitizenship\u2014a term that implies, at the least, a world state.\nThere ought to be a composite that will work here.\n\nIf the purpose of civic education is to generate in the young those\nvalues that underscore successful participation in our liberal\ndemocracies, then the task facing educators, whether in elementary\nschool, secondary school, or post-secondary school, might be far\neasier than we imagine. There seems to be a direct correlation between\nyears in school and an increase in tolerance of difference (Nie et\nal., 1996). An increase of tolerance can lead to an increase of\nrespect for those holding divergent views. Such increases could\ncertainly help engender a cosmopolitan sensibility. But does the\nnumber of years in school correlate with a willingness to participate\nin the first place? For example, the number of Americans going to\ncollege has increased dramatically over the past 50 years, yet voting\nin elections and political participation in general are still woefully\nlow.\n\nPerhaps public schools should not teach any virtue that is unrelated\nto the attainment of academic skills, which to some is the paramount,\nif not the sole, purpose of schooling. But shouldn\u2019t all\nstudents learn not just the skills but also the predispositions\nrequired to participate in the \u201cconscious social\nreproduction\u201d of our democracies, as Gutmann argues? If our\ndemocracies are important and robust, then do our citizens need such\npredispositions to see the value of participation? And if we say that\nour democracies are not robust enough, then shouldn\u2019t our\nstudents be striving to reinvigorate, or invigorate, our democratic\nsystems? Will they need infusions of patriotism to do that? If\ntolerance and respect are democratic virtues, then do we fail our\nstudents when we do not tolerate or respect their desires as good\npersons to eschew civic participation even though this violates what\nwe think of as the duties of good citizens?\n\nAs stated earlier, civic education in a democracy must prepare\ncitizens to participate in and thereby perpetuate the system; at the\nsame time, it must prepare them to challenge what they see as\ninequities and injustices within that system. Yet a civic education\nthat encourages students to challenge the nature and scope of our\ndemocracies runs the risk of turning off our students and turning them\naway from participation. But if that civic education has offered more\nthan simply critique, if its basis is critical thinking, which\ninvolves developing a tolerance of, if not an appreciation for,\ndifference and divergence, as well as a willingness and even eagerness\nfor political action, then galvanized citizens can make our systems\nmore robust. Greater demands on our citizens, like higher expectations\nof our students, often lead to stronger performances. As Mill reminds\nus, \u201cif circumstances allow the amount of public duty assigned\nhim to be considerable, it makes him an educated man\u201d (Ibid,\n233).\n",
