    "main_text": "Personal\n12. Personal\n\nEinstein was a pantheist but rejected any notion of a personal God\n(Einstein 2010, 325). And like Einstein, for many pantheists rejection\nof a personal deity is the definitive mark or most important element\nof their position (Levine 1994; Harrison 2013). However, the matter\ncalls for more considered attention.\n\nIt is important to distinguish between the specific question of\nwhether God is literally a \u2018person\u2019 and the more general\nquestion whether God is \u2018person-like\u2019; the issue of\nwhether notions such as intellect, thought, consciousness, intent,\netc. have any application to the divine, even if analogical or\nmetaphorical. It should also be recognised both that the notion of\npersonhood is itself deeply problematic, and that a not inconsiderable\nnumber of traditional theists would only with considerable\nqualification be prepared to allow that God is personal.\n\nThese points made, while it is true that traditional theism has\nregularly opposed pantheism on the grounds that it tends to be\nimpersonal, and true also that many pantheists would deny that God is\npersonal, it is nonetheless the case that many other pantheists have\nthought mind-like attribution of some form or other to the cosmos\nabsolutely central to their position (Bishop & Perszyk 2017; Hewitt\n2019; Mander 2022, 2017).\n\nIt is clear that pantheistic systems which start from the theistic God\nwhich they then find to be all-inclusive, or Absolute Idealist systems\nwhich derive all reality from a spiritual principle, will find it\neasier to attribute something like personhood to the cosmos than will\nthose which are more naturalistically motivated. But it is important\nto realise that not even the latter are wholly resistant to\npersonhood.\n\nFor example, it has been argued (Baltzly 2003) that the Stoics\nbelieved in a personal deity. Just as they construed human beings as\nphysical creatures animated by a physical soul, so too they regarded\nGod as the mind of the world\u2014with the cosmos as his body. Like a\nvast biological individual, to them God was a conscious rational\nbeing, exercising providence over life and to whom we might approach\nin prayer.\n\nSpinoza\u2019s God is an \u201cinfinite intellect\u201d,\n(Ethics 2p11c) all knowing, (2p3) and capable of loving both\nhimself\u2014and us, insofar as we are part of his perfection\n(5p35c). And if the mark of a personal being is that it is one towards\nwhich we can entertain personal attitudes, then we should note too\nthat Spinoza recommends amor intellectualist dei (the\nintellectual love of God) as the supreme good for man (5p33). However,\nthe matter is complex. Spinoza\u2019s God does not have free will\n(1p32c1), he does not have purposes or intentions (1appendix), and\nSpinoza insists that \u201cneither intellect nor will pertain to the\nnature of God\u201d (1p17s1). Moreover, while we may love God, we\nneed to remember that God is really not the kind of being who could\never love us back. \u201cHe who loves God cannot strive that God\nshould love him in return,\u201d says Spinoza (5p19).\n\nAnother notable pantheist to insist that the supreme being is personal\nwas Gustav Fechner, who develops a form of panpsychism according to\nwhich all organised matter must be thought of as possessing its own\ninner life or soul. The more complex and developed its structure, the\nmore sophisticated its spiritual life; from the lowest soul-life of\nplants, through our own mental life, which is just the inner side of\nour bodies, through the soul-life of the planets and stars up to the\nmost developed spirit of all, God, the consciousness which corresponds\nto the most complex organism there is, the cosmos itself. More\nrecently, a very similar view has been put forward by Timothy Sprigge\nwho maintains that that the only conceivable form of reality consists\nin streams of experience, such as we know ourselves to be, all of\nwhich must be thought of as included together within a single\nall-embracing experience; which we may call God or the Absolute.\nSprigge, however, is more cautious than Fechner insofar as he declines\nto identify any physical systems other than those of animals\n(including human beings) that can confidently be said to possess their\nown inner conscious life (Sprigge 2006, ch.9). Against the idea that\nGod is some type of all-embracing spirit or person it is often\ncomplained that this would undermine the autonomous personhood of\nfinite individuals; for can one person be part of another?\nFechner suggests as a model for understanding this the way in which\nour different sense modalities (sight, smell, touch, etc), each\ninaccessible to each other, combine together into one unified\nconsciousness (Fechner 1946, 144). While to extend such a model beyond\nthe merely receptive to the active aspects of personhood, we might\nthink of the way in which the agency of an organisation is exercised\nthrough the agency of its individual members. Here several pantheists\nhave been influenced by Christian ideas of the indwelling spirit of\nGod at work within the body of the Church.\n",
