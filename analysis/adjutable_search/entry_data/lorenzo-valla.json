    "preamble": "\n\nLorenzo Valla (c. 1406\u20131457) was one of the most important\nhumanists of his time. In his Elegantiae linguae Latinae, an\nadvanced handbook of Latin language and style, he gave the humanist\nprogram some of its most trenchant and combative formulations,\nbringing the study of Latin to an unprecedented level. He made\nnumerous contributions to classical scholarship. But he also used his\nvast knowledge of the classical languages and their literatures as a\ntool to criticize a wide range of ideas, theories, and established\npractices. He famously exposed the Donation of Constantine\u2014an\nimportant document justifying the papacy\u2019s claims to temporal\nrule\u2014as a forgery. He compared, for the first time, St.\nJerome\u2019s translation of the Bible with the Greek text of the New\nTestament, thereby laying the foundations of critical biblical\nscholarship. In his Repastinatio dialectice et philosophie\n(Re-ploughing of Dialectic and Philosophy), also known as his\nDialectics or Dialectical Disputations, he attacked\nscholastic-Aristotelian thought from an essentially linguistic point\nof view, arguing that philosophy should conform to common sense and\ncommon linguistic usage. Already highly controversial in his own\ntimes, Valla\u2019s works continue to provoke debate in modern times,\nwhich reflects broader discussions about the philosophical relevance\nand significance of Renaissance humanism for the development of early\nmodern philosophy.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Life and Works\n\nValla did not have an easy life. Equipped with a sharp and polemical\nmind, an even sharper pen and a sense of self-importance verging on\nthe pathological, he made many enemies throughout his life. Born in\nRome in (most likely) 1406 to a family with ties to the papal curia,\nValla as a young man was already in close contact with some major\nhumanists working as papal secretaries such as Leonardo Bruni\n(1370\u20131444) and Poggio Bracciolini (1380\u20131459). Another\nwas his uncle Melchior Scrivani, whom Valla had hoped to succeed after\nhis death; but opposition from Poggio and Antonio Loschi\n(1365/8\u20131441) must have led the pope to refuse to employ him.\nValla had criticized an elegy by Loschi, and had also boldly favored\nQuintilian over Cicero in a treatise which has long considered to be\nlost; but a lengthy anonymous prefatory letter has recently been found\nand ascribed, convincingly, to the young Valla (Pagliaroli 2008; it\nturns out not to be a comparison between Cicero\u2019s theory of\nrhetoric and Quintilian\u2019s handbook, as scholars have always\nassumed, but a comparison between a declamation of Ps-Quintilian,\nGladiator\u2014the declamations were considered to be the\nwork of Quintilian in Valla\u2019s time\u2014and one of\nCicero\u2019s orations, Pro Ligario.) Valla\u2019s Roman\nexperience of humanist conversations found an outlet in his dialogue\nDe voluptate (On Pleasure), in which the Christian\nconcepts of charity and beatitude are identified with hedonist\npleasure, while the \u201cStoic\u201d concept of virtue is rejected\n(see below). Valla would later revise the dialogue and change the\nnames of the interlocutors, but his Epicurean-Christian position\nremained the same.\n\nMeanwhile he had moved to Pavia in 1431, stimulated by his friend\nPanormita (Antonio Beccadelli, 1394\u20131471)\u2014with whom he was\nsoon to quarrel\u2014and had begun to teach rhetoric. He had to flee\nPavia, however, in 1433 after having aroused the anger of the jurists.\nIn a letter to a humanist jurist friend of his, Catone Sacco\n(1394\u20131463), Valla had attacked the language of one of the\nlawyers\u2019 main authorities, Bartolus of Sassoferrato\n(1313\u20131357). After some travelling, in 1435 Valla found\nemployment at the court of Alfonso of Aragon (1396\u20131458), who\nwas trying to capture Naples. Though complaining about the lack of\ntime, books and fellow humanists, Valla was immensely productive in\nthis phase of his career. In 1439 he finished the first version of his\ncritique of scholastic philosophy. Two years later he finished his\nElegantiae linguae Latinae, a manual for the correct use of\nLatin syntax and vocabulary, which became a bestseller throughout\nEurope. As a humanist in the court of a king who was fighting against\nthe pope, Valla demonstrated that the Donation of Constantine, which\nhad served the papacy to claim worldly power, was a forgery. In the\nsame years he composed a dialogue on free will and began working on\nhis annotations to the standard Latin translation of the Bible,\ncomparing it with the Greek text of the New Testament. He also wrote a\ndialogue On the Profession of the Religious (De\nprofessione religiosorum), in which he attacked the vow of\nobedience and asceticism taken by members of religious orders.\nFurther, he worked on the text of Livy, wrote a history of the deeds\nof Alfonso\u2019s father, and began re-reading and annotating\nQuintilian\u2019s Institutio oratoria (Education of the\nOrator) in a manuscript which is still extant (Paris,\nBiblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France, lat. 7723). But Valla\u2019s\nphilological approach and his penchant for quarreling made him enemies\nat the Aragonese court. After his patron Alfonso had made peace with\nthe pope in 1443, Valla\u2019s role as an anti-papal polemicist may\nhave shrunk. His enemies took advantage of the situation. The\nimmediate occasion was Valla\u2019s denial of the apostolic origin of\nthe Symbolum Apostolicum (Apostle\u2019s Creed). In a\nletter, now lost, to the Neapolitan lawyers he argued that a passage\nfrom Gratian\u2019s Decretum that formed the basis of the\nbelief in the apostolic origin of the Creed was corrupt and needed\nemendation. Powerful men at the court staged an inquisitorial trial to\ndetermine whether Valla\u2019s works contained heretical and\nheterodox opinions. In preparation for the trial Valla wrote a\nself-defense (and later an \u201cApology\u201d), but was rescued\nfrom this perilous situation by the intervention of the king. The\nwhole affair must have fuelled Valla\u2019s wish to return to Rome.\nIn 1447 he made peace with the pope and became an apostolic\nscriptor (scribe), and later, in 1455, a papal secretary. In\nthese years he revised some of his earlier works such as the\nRepastinatio and his notes on the New Testament, and\ntranslated Thucydides and Herodotus into Latin; his work on\nThucydides, in particular, was to have an important impact on the\nstudy of this difficult Greek author. Always an irascible man, he\ncontinued to engage in quarrels and exchanged a series of invectives\nwith his arch-enemy Poggio. He died in 1457, still working on a second\nrevision of his Dialectics (that is, the third version). He\nwas buried in the Lateran, where his grave was removed in the\nsixteenth century, probably between the 1560s and 1580s at a time when\nhis works were put on the Index; the present memorial is not Valla\u2019s\ntombstone.\n\nValla\u2019s impact on the humanist movement was long-lasting and\nvaried. His philological approach was developed by subsequent\ngenerations of humanists, and found, arguably, its first systematic\nexpression in the work of Angelo Poliziano (1454\u20131494). His\nElegantiae was printed many times, either in the original or\nin one of its many adaptations and abridgments made by later scholars.\nA copy of his annotations on the New Testament was found near Louvain\nby Erasmus (1467?\u20131534), who published it. Though many\ntheologians complained about his ignorance of theology, Luther and\nLeibniz, each for his own reasons, found occasion to refer to\nValla\u2019s dialogue on free will. Humanists found Valla\u2019s\ncriticisms of Aristotelian-scholastic thought congenial, though not a\nfew regarded his style as too aggressive and polemical. And though\nsome humanists such as Juan Luis Vives (1492\u20131540) and Johann\nEck (1486\u20131543) complained about Valla\u2019s lack of\nphilosophical acumen, his critique of scholasticism has a place in the\nlong transformation from medieval to modern thought\u2014in which\nhumanism played an important though by no means exclusive role.\n2. Valla\u2019s Critique of Scholastic Philosophy\n\nIn his Repastinatio dialectice et philosophie, which is\nextant in three versions with slightly different titles, Valla attacks\nwhat he sees as the foundations of scholastic-Aristotelian philosophy\nand sets out to transform Aristotelian dialectic. As the title of the\nfirst version clearly indicates, he wants to \u201cre-plough\u201d\nthe ground traditionally covered by the Aristotelian scholastics. The\nterm repastinatio means not only \u201cre-ploughing\u201d\nor \u201cre-tilling\u201d but also \u201ccutting back\u201d and\n\u201cweeding out.\u201d Valla desires to weed out everything he\nregards as barren and infertile in scholastic thought and to\nre-cultivate the ground by sprinkling it with the fertile waters of\nrhetoric and grammar. His use of repastinatio indicates that\nhe is setting out a program of reform rather than of destruction, in\nspite of his often aggressive and polemical tone. Book I is devoted\nmainly to metaphysics, but also contains chapters on natural\nphilosophy and moral philosophy, as well a controversial chapter on\nthe Trinity. In Books II and III Valla discusses propositions and\nforms of argumentation such as the syllogism.\n\nHis main concern in the first book is to simplify the\nAristotelian-scholastic apparatus. For Valla, the world consists of\nthings, simply called res. Things have qualities and do or\nundergo things (which he refers to as \u201cthings\u201d). Hence,\nthere are three basic categories: substance, quality, and action. At\nthe back of Valla\u2019s mind are the grammatical categories of noun,\nadjective, and verb; but in many places he points out that we cannot\nassume that, for instance, an adjective always refer to a quality or a\nverb to an action (Repastinatio, 1:134\u2013156;\n425\u2013442; DD 1:240\u201380). These three categories are the\nonly ones Valla admits; the other Aristotelian categories of accidents\nsuch as place, time, relation and quantity can all be reduced to\nquality or action. Here, too, grammar plays a leading role in\nValla\u2019s thought. From a grammatical point of view, qualities\nsuch as being a father, being in the classroom, or being six-feet tall\nall tell us something about how a particular man is qualified; and\nthere is, consequently, no need to preserve the other Aristotelian\ncategories.\n\nIn reducing the categories to his triad of substance, quality, and\naction, Valla does not seem to have in mind \u201crealist\u201d\nphilosophers who accepted the independent existence of entities such\nas relations and quantities over and above individual things. Instead,\nhis aim is to show that many terms traditionally placed in other\ncategories, in fact, point to qualities or actions: linguistic usage\n(loquendi consuetudo) teaches us, for example, that\nquality is the overarching category. Thus, to the question \u201cof\nwhat kind\u201d, we often give answers containing quantitative\nexpressions. Take, for instance, the question: what sort of horse\nshould I buy? It may be answered: erect, tall, with a broad chest, and\nso on. Valla\u2019s reduction of the categories often assumes the\nform of grammatical surveys of certain groups of words associated with\na particular category: thus, in his discussion of time, he studies\nwords like \u201cday,\u201d \u201cyear,\u201d and a host of\nothers; and his discussion of quantitative words treats mathematical\nterms such as line, point and circle. Of course, Valla does not deny\nthat we can speak of quantity or time or place. But the rich array of\nLatin terms signify, in the final analysis, the qualities or actions\nof things, and nothing exists apart from concrete things. (Substance\nis a shady category for Valla, who says that he cannot give an example\nof it, much as Locke was later to maintain that \u201ca substance is\nsomething I know not what\u201d).\n\nIt is tempting to connect this lean ontology to that of William of\nOckham (c. 1287\u20131347). The interests, approach and arguments of\nthe two thinkers, however, differ considerably. Unlike Valla, Ockham\ndoes not want to get rid of the system of categories. As long as one\nrealizes, Ockham says, that categories do not describe things in the\nworld but categorize terms by which we signify real\nsubstances or real inhering qualities in different ways, the\ncategories can be maintained and the specific features of, for\nexample, relational or quantitative terms can be explored. Thus,\nOckham\u2019s rejection of a realist interpretation of the categories\nis accompanied by a wish to defend the categories as distinct\ngroups of terms. Valla, on the other hand, sees the categories as\nsumming up the real aspects of things: hence, there are only\nsubstances, qualities, and actions, and his reductive program consists\nin showing that we have a vast and rich vocabulary in Latin that we\ncan use for referring to these things. His questions about words and\nclasses of words are not unlike those of Priscian (fl. 500\u2013530)\nand other grammarians. (Priscian, for instance, had stated that a noun\nsignifies substance plus quality, and pronouns substance without\nquality.)\n\nAnother good example of Valla\u2019s reduction of scholastic\nterminology, distinctions, and concepts is his critique of the\ntranscendental terms (Repastinatio 1:11\u201321; DD\n1:18\u201336). According to Valla, the traditional six\nterms\u2014\u201cbeing,\u201d \u201cthing,\u201d\n\u201csomething,\u201d \u201cone,\u201d \u201ctrue,\u201d and\n\u201cgood\u201d\u2014should be reduced to \u201cthing\u201d\n(Latin res) since everything that exists, including a quality\nor an action of a thing (also called a \u201cthing\u201d) is a\nthing. A good thing, for example, is a thing, and so, too, is a true\nthing. From a grammatical point of view, such terms as\n\u201cgood\u201d and \u201ctrue\u201d are adjectives, and when\nused as substantives (the good, the one), they refer to qualities;\nhence, there is nothing \u201ctranscendental\u201d about them.\nValla\u2019s grammatical approach is evident in his rejection of the\nscholastic term ens. Just as \u201crunning\u201d\n(currens) can be resolved into \u201che who runs\u201d\n(is qui currit), so \u201cbeing\u201d (ens) can be\nresolved into \u201cthat which is\u201d (id quod est).\n\u201cThat,\u201d however, is nothing other than \u201cthat\nthing\u201d (ea res); so we get as a result the\nlaborious formula: \u201cthat thing which is\u201d.\n(Repastinatio 1:14; DD 1:23\u201325.) We do not, however,\nneed the phrase \u201cthat which is\u201d (ea que est):\n\u201ca stone is a being\u201d (lapis est ens), or the\nequivalent phrase into which it can be resolved, \u201ca stone is a\nthing which is\u201d (lapis est res que est), are unclear,\nawkward, and absurd ways of saying simply that \u201ca stone is a\nthing\u201d (lapis est res). Valla also rejects other\nscholastic terms such as entitas (\u201centity\u201d),\nhecceitas (\u201cthis-ness\u201d) and quidditas\n(\u201cquidity\u201d) for grammatical reasons: these terms do not\nconform to the rules of word formation in Latin. While he is not\nagainst the introduction of new words for things unknown in antiquity\n(e.g., bombarda for \u201ccannonball\u201d), the\nterminology coined by the scholastics is a different matter\nentirely.\n\nRelated to this analysis is Valla\u2019s repudiation of what he\npresents as the scholastic view of the distinction between abstract\nand concrete terms, that is, the view that abstract terms\n(\u201cwhiteness,\u201d \u201cfatherhood\u201d) always refer\nsolely to quality, while concrete terms (\u201cwhite,\u201d\n\u201cfather\u201d) refer to both substance and quality\n(Repastinatio, 1:21\u201330; DD 1:36\u201354). In a\ncareful discussion of this distinction, taking into account the\ngrammatical categories of case, number, and gender, Valla rejects the\nontological commitments which such a view seems to imply, and shows,\non the basis of a host of examples drawn from classical Latin usage,\nthat abstract terms often have the same meaning as their concrete\ncounterparts (useful/utility, true/truth, honest/honesty). These terms\nrefer to the concrete thing itself, that is, to the substance, its\nquality or action (or a combination of these three components into\nwhich a thing can be resolved). Again, Valla\u2019s main concern is\nto study the workings of language and how these relate to the world of\neveryday things, the world that we see and experience.\n\nIn describing and analyzing this world of things Valla is not only\nguided by grammatical considerations. He also uses \u201ccommon\nsense\u201d and the limits of our imagination as yardsticks against\nwhich to measure scholastic notions and definitions. He thus thinks\nthat it is ridiculous to imagine prime matter without any form or form\nwithout any matter, or to define a line as that which has no width and\na point as an indivisible quantity that occupies no space.\nValla\u2019s idea is that notions such as divisibility and quantity\nare properly at home only in the world of ordinary things. For him,\nthere is only the world of bodies with actual shapes and dimensions;\nlines and points are parts of these things, but only, as he seems to\nsuggest, in a derivative sense, in other words, as places or spaces\nthat are filled by the body or parts of that body. If we want to\nmeasure or sketch a (part of a) body, we can select two spots on it\nand measure the length between them by drawing points and lines on\npaper or in our mind, a process through which these points and lines\nbecome visible and divisible parts of our world\n(Repastinatio, 1:142\u2013147; 2:427\u2013431; DD\n254\u201364). But it would be wrong to abstract from this diagramming\nfunction and infer a world of points and lines with their own\nparticular quantity. They are merely aids for measuring or outlining\nbodies. In modern parlance, Valla seems to be saying that ontological\nquestions about these entities\u2014do they exist? how do they\nexist?\u2014amount to category mistakes, equivalent to asking the\ncolor of virtue.\n\nThe appeal to common sense (or what Valla considers as such) informs\nhis critique of Aristotelian natural philosophy. He insists on\ncommonplace observations and experiences as criteria for testing ideas\nand hypotheses. On this basis, many of Aristotle\u2019s contentions,\nso Valla argues, are not true to the facts (Repastinatio,\n1:98\u2013112; DD 1:174\u201399). He rejects or qualifies a\nnumber of fundamental tenets of Aristotelian physics, for instance\nthat movement is the cause of heat, that a movement is always caused\nby another movement, that elements can be transformed into one\nanother, that each has its own proper qualities (heat and dryness for\nfire, heat and humidity for air, etc.), that there are pure elements,\nthat the combination of heat and humidity is a sufficient condition\nfor the generation of life, and so forth. Valla often uses\nreductio ad absurdum as an argumentative strategy: if\nAristotle\u2019s theory is true, one would expect to observe\nphenomena quite different from the ones we do, in fact, observe. In\narguing, for instance, for the existence of a fiery sphere below the\nmoon, Aristotle had claimed that \u201cleaden missiles shot out by\nforce melt in the air\u201d (De caelo II.7,\n289a26\u201328). Valla rejects this claim by appealing to ordinary\nexperience: we never see balls\u2014whether leaden, iron, or stone,\nshot out of a sling or a cannon\u2014heat up in the air; nor do the\nfeathers of arrows catch fire. If movement is sufficient to produce\nheat, the spheres would set the air beneath in motion; but no one has\never observed this. Arguably, the importance of Valla\u2019s polemic\nhere is not so much the quality of his arguments as the critical\ntendency they reveal, the awareness that Aristotle\u2019s conclusions\noften do not conform to daily experience. While he does not develop\nhis critique in the direction of an alternative natural philosophy as\nlater Renaissance philosophers such as Bernardino Telesio\n(1509\u20131588) and Francesco Patrizi of Cherso (1529\u20131597)\nwould do, Valla contributed to undermining faith in the exclusive\nvalidity of the Aristotelian paradigm.\n\nValla also criticizes Aristotle\u2019s natural philosophy because,\naccording to him, it detracts from God\u2019s power. In strongly\npolemical terms, he attacks Aristotle for his\n\u201cpolytheistic\u201d ideas and for what Valla sees as his\nequation of God with nature (Repastinatio, 1:54\u201359;\nDD 1:94\u2013103). Valla wants to reinstate God as the sole\ncreator of heaven and earth. To think of the cosmos in terms of a\nliving animal or the heavens in terms of celestial orbs moved by\nintelligences is anathema to Valla (as it was to many medieval\nscholastics as well). The notion of God as First Mover is also\nrejected, since movement and rest are terms which should not be\napplied (except perhaps metaphorically) to spiritual beings such as\nGod, angels, and souls.\n\nReligious considerations also led Valla to find fault with another\nfundamental tenet of Aristotelian scholastic thought: the Tree of\nPorphyry (Repastinatio, 1:46\u201350; 2:389\u2013391;\nDD 1:82\u201388). Valla has several problems with the Tree. First\nof all, it puts substance, rather than thing, on top. For Valla,\nhowever, pure substance does not exist, since a thing is always\nalready a qualified substance. He also thinks that there is no place\nfor a human being in the Tree of Porphyry. Since the Tree divides\nsubstance into the corporeal and the spiritual, it is difficult to\nfind a place for a human being, consisting of both soul and body.\nMoreover, the Tree covers both the divine and the created order, which\nleads to inappropriate descriptions of God and angels, to which the\nterm \u201canimal\u201d should not be applied, since they do not\nhave a body. Valla, therefore, divides Porphyry\u2019s Tree into\nthree different trees: one for spiritual substance, one for corporeal\nsubstance, and one for what he calls \u201canimal,\u201d that is,\nthose creatures which consist of both body and soul\n(Repastinatio, 1:49\u201350; 2:422\u2013424; DD\n1:88). One might argue that what Valla gains over Porphyry by\ndisentangling the supernatural from the natural order, he loses by\nhaving to admit that he cannot place Christ in any of his three trees,\nsince he is not only human but also God.\n\nThe soul as an incorporeal substance is treated by Valla in a separate\nchapter (Repastinatio, 1:59\u201373; 2:408\u2013410;\n418\u2013419; DD 1:104\u201329). Rejecting the Aristotelian\nhylomorphic account, he returns to an Augustinian picture of the soul\nas a wholly spiritual and immaterial substance made in the image of\nGod, and consisting of memory, intellect, and will. He rejects without\nmuch discussion the various functions of the soul (vegetative,\nsensitive, imaginative, intellectual), which would entail, he thinks,\na plurality of souls. He briefly treats the five exterior senses but\nis not inclined to deal with the physiological aspects of sensation.\nThe term \u201cspecies\u201d (whether sensible or intelligible) does\nnot occur at all. The Aristotelian sensus\ncommunis\u2014which the medieval commentary tradition on\nDe anima had viewed as one of the internal senses,\nalongside imagination (sometimes distinguished from\nphantasia), memory, and the vis aestimativa\n(foresight and prudence)\u2014is mentioned only to be rejected\nwithout further argument (Repastinatio, 1:73; DD\n1:128). Imagination and the vis aestimativa are absent from\nValla\u2019s account, while memory, as the soul\u2019s principal\ncapacity, appears to have absorbed all the functions which scholastics\nhad divided among separate faculties of the sensitive soul. What may\nhave provoked Valla\u2019s anger about the traditional picture is the\nseemingly passive role allotted to the soul in perception and\nknowledge: it seems to come only at the very end of a long chain of\ntransmission, which starts with outer objects and concludes with a\nmerely receptive tabula rasa. In his view, the soul is far\nmore noble than the hylomorphic account of Aristotle implies, at least\nas Valla understands that account. He therefore stresses on various\noccasions the soul\u2019s dignified nature, its immortality, unity,\nautonomy, and superiority to both the body and the animal soul,\ncomparing it to the sun\u2019s central place in the cosmos.\n3. Valla\u2019s \u201cReform\u201d of Aristotelian Logic\n\nAfter Valla\u2019s attack on what he calls the fundamenta\n(foundations) of Aristotelian-scholastic metaphysics and natural\nphilosophy, he turns to dialectic in Books II and III of his\nRepastinatio. For Valla, argumentation should be approached\nfrom an oratorical rather than a logical point of view. What counts is\nwhether an argument works, which means whether it convinces\none\u2019s adversary or public. The form of the argument is less\nimportant. Dialectic is a species of confirmation and refutation; and,\nas such, it is merely a component of invention, one of the five parts\nof rhetoric (Repastinatio, 1:175; 2:447; DD 2:3).\nCompared to rhetoric, dialectic is an easy subject and does not\nrequire much time to master, since it considers and uses only the\nsyllogism \u201cbare\u201d, as Valla puts it, that is, in isolation\nfrom its wider argumentative context; its sole aim is to teach. The\nrhetorician, on the other hand, uses not only the syllogism, but also\nthe enthymeme (incomplete syllogism), epicheireme (a kind of extended\nreasoning) and example. The orator has to clothe everything in\npersuasive arguments, since his task is not only to teach but also to\nplease and to move. This leads Valla to downplay the importance of the\nAristotelian syllogism and to consider forms of argumentation that are\nnot easily forced into its straightjacket. Among these are captious\nforms of reasoning such as the dilemma, paradox, and heap argument\n(sorites), and Valla offers an interesting analysis of these\nforms in the last book of the Repastinatio.\n\nWithout rejecting the syllogism tout court, Valla is scathing\nabout its usefulness. He regards it as an artificial type of\nreasoning, unfit to be employed by orators since it is does not\nreflect the natural way of speaking and arguing. What is the use, for\nexample, of concluding that Socrates is an animal if one has already\nstated that every man is an animal and that Socrates is a man? It is a\nsimple, puerile, and pedantic affair, hardly amounting to a real\nars (art). Valla\u2019s treatment of the syllogism clearly\nshows his oratorical perspective. Following Quintilian, he stresses\nthat the nature of syllogistic reasoning is to establish proof. One of\nthe two premises contains what is to be proven (que\nprobatur), and the other offers the proof (que probat),\nwhile the conclusion gives the result of the proof\u2014into which\nthe proof \u201cgoes down\u201d (in quam probatio\ndescendit). It is not always necessary, therefore, to have a\nfixed order (major, minor, conclusion). If it suits the occasion\nbetter, we can just as well begin with the minor, or even with the\nconclusion. The order is merely a matter of convention and custom\n(Repastinatio, 1:282\u2013286; 2:531\u2013534; DD\n2:216\u201339).\n\nThese complaints about the artificiality of the syllogism inform\nValla\u2019s discussion of the three figures of the syllogism.\nAristotle had proven the validity of the moods of Figure 2 and 3 by\nconverting them to four moods of Figure 1; and this was taught, for\nexample, by Peter of Spain (thirteenth century) in his widely read\nhandbook on logic, the Summulae logicales, certainly\nconsulted by Valla here. Valla regards this whole business of\nconverting terms and transposing propositions in order to reduce a\nparticular syllogism to one of these four moods of Figure 1 as useless\nand absurd. While he does not question the validity of these four\nmoods, he believes that there are many deviant syllogisms that are\nalso valid, for instance: God is in every place; Tartarus is a place;\ntherefore, God is in Tartarus. Here the \u201cevery\u201d or\n\u201call\u201d sign is added to the predicate in the major\nproposition. He says, moreover, that an entirely singular syllogism\ncan be valid: Homer is the greatest of poets; this man is the greatest\nof poets; therefore, this man is Homer. And he gives many other\nexamples of such deviant schemes. Valla thus deliberately ignores the\ncriteria employed by Aristotle and his commentators\u2014that at\nleast one premise must be universal, and at least one premise must be\naffirmative, and that if the conclusion is to be negative, one premise\nmust be negative\u2014or, at any rate, he thinks that they\nunnecessarily restrict the number of possible valid figures.\n\nIn his discussion of the syllogism Valla does not refer to an\nimportant principle employed by Aristotle and his commentators:\ndici de omni et nullo (to be said/predicated about all and\nabout none). To quote Peter of Spain\u2019s Summulae\nlogicales: \u201cTo be said of every [dici de\nomni] is when there is nothing to to be taken under the subject\n[nichil est sumere sub subiecto] of which the predicate may\nnot be said, like \u2018every man runs\u2019: here, running is said\nof every man, and under man there is nothing to to be taken of which\nrunning is not said. To be said of none [de nullo]\nis when there is nothing to be taken under the subject from which the\npredicate may not be eliminated, like \u2018no man runs\u2019: here,\nrunning is eliminated from any man at all [quolibet\nhomine]\u201d (ed. L. M. de Rijk 1972, 43; ed. Copenhaver et\nal., 2014, 170). This principle led Aristotle to conclude that only\nfour moods of the first figure were immediately valid. That Valla does\nnot make use of this fundamental condition is understandable from his\noratorical point of view, since it would be an uninteresting or even\nirrelevant criterion of validity. It is therefore not surprising that\nhe thinks that we might as well \u201creduce\u201d the first figure\nto the second rather than vice versa. Likewise, from his oratorical\npoint of view, he can only treat the third figure of the syllogism\nwith contempt: it is a \u201ccompletely foolish\u201d form of\nreasoning; no one reasons as follows: every man is a substance; every\nman is an animal; therefore, some animal is a substance. In a similar\nvein, he rejects the use of letters in the study of syllogisms\n(Repastinatio, 1:297\u2013300; 2:546\u2013548; DD\n2:264\u201371).\n\nValla\u2019s insistence on examining and assessing arguments in terms\nof persuasion and usefulness leads him to criticize not only the\nsyllogism but also other less formal modes of argumentation. These\nmodes usually involve interrogation, resulting in an unexpected or\nunwanted conclusion or an aporetic situation. Some scholars have\nregarded Valla\u2019s interest in these less formal or non-formal\narguments as an expression of a skeptical attitude towards the\npossibility of certainty in knowledge in general. Others have raised\nserious doubts about this interpretation. What we can say for sure,\nhowever, is that Valla was one of the first to study and analyze the\nheap argument, dilemma, and suchlike. The heap argument is supposed to\ninduce doubts about the possibility of determining precise limits,\nespecially to quantities. If I subtract one grain from a heap, is it\nstill a heap? Of course. What if I subtract two grains? And so forth,\nuntil the heap consists of just one grain, which, to be sure, is an\nunacceptable conclusion. It seems impossible to determine the exact\nmoment when the heap ceases to be a heap, and any attempt to determine\nthis moment seems to involve an ad hoc decision, for a heap does not\ncease to be a heap due to the subtraction of just one single grain.\nValla discusses a number of similar cases, and comments on their\nfallacious nature.\n\nDilemma, too, receives extensive treatment from him. This type of\nargument had been widely studied in antiquity. The basic structure is\na disjunction of propositions, usually in the form of a double\nquestion in an interrogation, which sets a trap for the respondent,\nsince whichever horn of the dilemma he chooses, he seems to be caught\nup in a contradiction and will lose the debate (\u201cIf he is\nmodest, why should you accuse someone who is a good man? If he is bad,\nwhy should you accuse someone who is unconcerned by such a\ncharge?\u201d, Cicero, De inventione 1.45.83, cited by Valla\nRepastinatio, 1:321; DD 2:332). It was also\nrecognized that the respondent could often counter the dilemma by\nduplicating the original argument and \u201cturning it back\u201d\n(convertere) on the interrogator, using it as a kind of\nboomerang (\u201cif he is modest, you should accuse him because he\nwill be concerned by such a charge; if he is bad, you should also\naccuse him because he is not a good man\u201d). Alternatively, he\ncould escape the dilemma by questioning the disjunction and showing\nthat there is a third possibility. There were many variations of this\nsimple scheme, and it was studied from a logical as well as a\nrhetorical point of view with considerable overlap between these two\nperspectives.\n\nIn medieval times, dilemma does not seem to have attracted much\ntheoretical reflection, though there was an extensive literature on\nrelated genres such as insolubilia and paradoxes, which were\ngenerally treated in a logical manner. It is, therefore, interesting\nto see Valla discussing a whole range of examples of dilemma. The\nrhetoric textbook by the Byzantine \u00e9migr\u00e9 George of\nTrebizond (1396\u20131486), composed about 1433, was probably an\nimportant source for him. This work might also have led Valla to\nexplore the relevant places in Quintilian, Cicero, the Greek text of\nAristotle\u2019s Rhetoric and perhaps other Greek sources.\nThe example Valla discusses most extensively comes from Aulus Gellius\nand concerns a lawsuit between Protagoras and his pupil Euathlus\n(Repastinatio, 1:312\u2013319; 2:562\u2013568; DD\n2:312\u201328. Aulus Gellius, Noctes Atticae, 5.10.5\u201316).\nThe pupil has promised to pay the second installment of the fees as\nsoon as he has won his first case. He refuses to undertake any cases,\nhowever, and Protagoras takes him to court, putting the case in the\nform of a dilemma. If Euathlus loses the case, he will have to pay the\nrest of the fee, on account of the verdict of the judges; but if\nEuathlus wins, he will also have to pay, this time on account of his\nagreement with Protagoras. Euathlus, however, cleverly converts the\nargument: in neither case will he have to pay, on account of the\ncourt\u2019s decision (if he wins), or on account of the agreement\nwith Protagoras (if he loses). Aulus Gellius thinks that the judges\nshould have refrained from passing judgment because any decision would\nbe inconsistent with itself. But Valla rejects such a rebuttal\n(antistrephon or conversio) of the dilemma and\nthinks that a response may be formulated as long as one concentrates\non the relevant aspects of the case. He carefully considers the\nperspectives of all parties, the words employed, the feelings of the\njudges, and all the circumstances of the case. In a highly rhetorical\nanalysis of the case in which Valla makes speeches on behalf of\nProtagoras, Valla says in the end that Euathlus cannot have it both\nways and must choose one or the other alternative, not both: he must\ncomply either with his agreement with Protagoras (and pay the rest of\nthe fees) or with the verdict passed by the judges. If he loses the\ncase, a refusal to obey the sentence of the judges shows contempt; if\nhe wins the case, he has to pay the rest of the fee to Protagoras. At\nany rate, there is no reason for the judges to despair; Aulus Gellius\nis, therefore, wrong in thinking that they should have refrained\nfrom passing a judgment. In all such cases, Valla argues, the\nconversion is not a rebuttal, but at best a correction of the initial\nargument (a correction, however, is not a refutation), and at worst a\nsimple repetition or illegitimate shift of the initial position.\n\nAn important way of seeing through deceptive arguments is to consider\nthe weight of words carefully, and Valla gives some further examples\nof fallacies which can easily be refuted by examining the meaning and\nusage of words and the contexts in which they occur\n(Repastinatio, 1:320\u2013334; 2:568\u2013578; DD\n2:328\u201369). He considers the fallacies \u201ccollected by Aristotle in\nhis Sophistical Refutations as for the most part a puerile\nart,\u201d quoting the Rhetorica ad Herennium (2.11.16) to\nthe effect that \u201cknowledge of ambiguities as taught by\ndialecticians is of no help at all but rather a most serious\nhindrance.\u201d Valla is not interested in providing a comprehensive\nlist of deceptive arguments and errors or in studying rules for\nresolving them. He does not mention, for example, the basic division\nbetween linguistic (in dictione) and extra-linguistic\n(extra dictionem) fallacies. In a letter to a friend, Valla\nlists some \u201cdialecticians\u201d\u2014Albert of Saxony (c.\n1316\u20131390), Albert the Great (c. 1220\u20131280), Ralph Strode\n(fl. 1350\u20131400), William of Ockham, and Paul of Venice (c.\n1369\u20131429) \u2014but there is no sign that he had done more\nthan leaf through their works on sophismata and\ninsolubilia (Valla 1984, 201). The few examples he gives seem\nto come from Peter of Spain\u2019s Summulae logicales. Nor\nwas it necessary to have more than a superficial acquaintance with the\nworks of these dialecticians in order to realize that their approach\ndiffered vastly from his. As he repeatedly states, what is required in\norder to disambiguate fallacies is not a deeper knowledge of the rules\nof logic but a recognition that arguments need to be evaluated within\ntheir wider linguistic and argumentative context. Such an examination\nof how words and arguments function will easily lay bare the\nartificial and sophistical nature of these forms of argumentation.\n\nThis approach is also evident in Valla\u2019s analysis of the\nproposition of which a syllogism or argument consists. Propositions\nare traditionally divided according to quantity (universal of\nparticular) and to quality (affirmative and negative). Quantity and\nquality are indicated by words that are called signa\n(markers, signs): \u201call,\u201d \u201cany,\u201d\n\u201cnot,\u201d \u201cno one,\u201d and so forth. In Book II of\nthe Repastinatio, Valla considers a much wider range of words\nthan the medieval logicians, who had mainly worked with\n\u201call,\u201d \u201csome,\u201d \u201cnone,\u201d and\n\u201cno one\u201d. To some extent, his aim is not unlike that of\nthe dialecticians whom he so frequently attacks, that is, to study\nsigns of quality and negation and how they determine the scope of a\nproposition. But for him there is only one proper method of carrying\nout such a study: examining carefully the multifarious ways in which\nthese words are used in refined and grammatically correct Latin. Not\nsurprisingly, Valla criticizes the square of contraries\u2014the\nfourfold classification of statements in which the distinction between\nuniversal and particular and that between affirmative and negative are\ncombined. A similar critique of the rather arbitrary restriction to a\nlimited set of words is applied to the scholastic notion of modality\n(Valla Repastinatio, 1:237\u2013244; 2:491\u2013497;\nDD 2:126\u201343). Scholastics usually treat only the following\nsix terms as modals: \u201cpossible,\u201d \u201cimpossible,\u201d\n\u201ctrue,\u201d \u201cfalse,\u201d \u201cnecessary,\u201d and\n\u201ccontingent.\u201d Latin, however, is much more resourceful in\nexpressing modality. Using criteria such as refinement and utility,\nValla considers terms such as \u201clikely/unlikely,\u201d\n\u201cdifficult/easy,\u201d \u201ccertain/uncertain,\u201d\n\u201cuseful/useless,\u201d \u201cbecoming/unbecoming,\u201d and\n\u201chonorable/dishonorable.\u201d This amounts to introducing a\nwholly new concept of modality, which comes close to an adverbial\nqualification of a given action.\n\nValla\u2019s principal b\u00eates noires are Aristotle,\nBoethius, Porphyry, and Peter of Spain, but he also speaks in general\nterms of the entire natio peripatetica (nation of\nPeripatetics). He frequently refers to isti (those), a\nsuitably vague label for the scholastic followers of\nAristotle\u2014including both dialecticians and theologians. It has\noften been claimed that Valla is attacking late medieval\nscholasticism; but it must be said that he does not quote any late\nmedieval scholastic philosophers or theologians. He generally steers\nclear of their questions, arguments, and terminology. If we compare\nValla\u2019s Repastinatio with, for example, Paul of\nVenice\u2019s Logica parva (The Small\nLogic), we quickly perceive the immense difference in attitude,\nargument, and approach. Moreover, as noted above, Valla\u2019s\ngrammatical and oratorical approach is fundamentally different from\nOckham\u2019s terminism. He probably thought that he did not need to\nengage with the technical details of scholastic works. It was\nsufficient for him to establish that there was a huge distance between\nhis own approach and that of the scholastics. Once he had shown that\nthe scholastic-Aristotelian edifice was built on shaky foundations, he\ndid not care to attack the superstructure, so to speak. And Valla\nproved to his own satisfaction that these foundations were shaky by\nshowing that the terminology and vocabulary of the scholastics rested\non a misunderstanding of Latin and of the workings of language in\ngeneral. But even though his criticisms are mainly addressed to\nAristotle, Boethius, and Porphyry, his more general opinion of\nAristotelianism was, of course, formed by what he saw in his own time.\nHe loathed the philosophical establishment at the universities, their\nmethods, genres, and, above all, their style and terminology. He\nthought that they were slavishly following Aristotle. In his view,\nhowever, a true philosopher does not hesitate to re-assess any opinion\nfrom whatever source; refusing to align himself with a sect or school,\nhe presents himself as a critical, independent thinker\n(Repastinatio, 1:1\u20138; 2:359\u2013363; DD\n1:2\u201312). Whether scholasticism had, indeed, ossified by the time Valla\ncame on the scene is a matter of debate; but there is no question that\nthis is how he and the other humanists saw it.\n4. Moral Philosophy\n\nThe same critical spirit also infuses Valla\u2019s work on moral\nphilosophy. In his dialogue, published as De voluptate in\n1431, when he was still in his mid-twenties, and revised two years\nlater under the title De vero bono (On the True\nGood), Valla presents a discussion between an\n\u201cEpicurean,\u201d a \u201cStoic,\u201d and a\n\u201cChristian\u201d on an age-old question: what is the highest\nethical good? The result of this confrontation between pagan and\nChristian moral thought is a combination of Pauline fideism and\nEpicurean hedonism, in which the Christian concepts of charity and\nbeatitude are identified with hedonist pleasure, and the\n\u201cStoic\u201d concept of virtue is rejected (Valla, De vero\nfalsoque bono). Valla thus treats Epicureanism as a\nstepping-stone to the development of a Christian morality based on the\nconcept of pleasure, and repudiates the traditional synthesis of\nStoicism and Christianity, popular among scholastics and humanists\nalike. The substance of the dialogue is repeated in a long chapter in\nhis Repastinatio (Repastinatio, 1:73\u201398;\n2:411\u2013418; DD 1:130\u201375).\n\nValla\u2019s strategy is to reduce the traditional four\nvirtues\u2014 prudence, justice, fortitude, and propriety (or\ntemperance)\u2014to fortitude, and then to equate fortitude with\ncharity and love. For Valla, fortitude is the essential virtue, since\nit shows that we do not allow ourselves to be conquered by the wrong\nemotions, but instead to act for the good. As a true virtue of action,\nit is closely connected to justice and is defined as \u201ca certain\nresistance against both the harsh and the pleasant things which\nprudence has declared to be evils.\u201d It is the power to tolerate\nand suffer adversity and bad luck, but also to resist the\nblandishments of a fortune which can be all too good, thus weakening\nthe spirit. Fortitude is the only true virtue, because virtue resides\nin the will, since our actions, to which we assign moral\nqualifications, proceed from the will.\n\nValla\u2019s reductive strategy has a clear aim: to equate this\nessential virtue of action, fortitude, with the biblical concept of\nlove and charity. This step requires some hermeneutic manipulation,\nbut the Stoic overtones of Cicero\u2019s account in De\nofficiis have prepared the way for it\u2014ironically, perhaps,\nin view of Valla\u2019s professed hostility towards\nStoicism\u2014since enduring hardship with Stoic patience is easily\nlinked to the Pauline message that we become strong by being tested\n(II Cor. 12:10, quoted by Valla). The labor, sweat, and trouble we\nmust bear, though bad in themselves, \u201care called good because\nthey lead to that victory,\u201d Valla writes, echoing St Paul\n(Repastinatio, 1:88\u201389; 2:415; DD 1:156). We\ndo not, then, strive to attain virtue for its own sake, since it is\nfull of toil and hardship, but rather because it leads us to our goal.\nThis is one of Valla\u2019s major claims against the Stoics and the\nPeripatetics, who\u2014at least in Valla\u2019s\ninterpretation\u2014 regarded virtue as the end of life, that is, the\ngoal which is sought for its own sake. Because virtuous behavior is\ndifficult, requiring us to put up with harsh and bitter afflictions,\nno one naturally and voluntarily seeks virtue as an end in itself.\nWhat we seek is pleasure or delectation, both in this life\nand\u2014far more importantly \u2014in the life to come.\n\nBy equating pleasure with love, Valla can argue that it is love or\npleasure that is our ultimate end. This entails the striking notion\nthat God is not loved for his own sake, but for the sake of love:\n\u201cFor nothing is loved for its own sake or for the sake of\nsomething else as another end, but the love itself is the end\u201d\n(Repastinatio, 2:417). This is a daring move. Traditionally,\nGod was said to be loved for his own sake, not for his usefulness in\ngaining something else. Many thinkers agreed with Augustine that\nconcupiscent love was to be distinguished from friendship, and, with\nrespect to heavenly beatitude, use from fruition. We can love\nsomething as a means to an end (use), and we can love something for\nits own sake (fruition). But because Valla has maintained that\npleasure is our highest good, God can only be loved as a means to that\nend.\n\nIt is therefore a moot point whether Valla successfully integrated\nEpicurean hedonism with Christian morality. He seems to argue that the\nEpicurean position is valid only for the period before the coming of\nChrist. In our unredeemed state, we are rightly regarded as\npleasure-seeking animals, governed by self-interest and utilitarian\nmotives. After Christ\u2019s coming, however, we have a different\npicture: repudiating Epicurean pleasure, we should choose the harsh\nand difficult life of Christian honestas (virtue) as a step\ntowards heavenly beatitude. Yet, the two views of human beings are not\nso readily combined. On the one hand, there is the positive evaluation\nof pleasure as the fundamental principle in human\npsychology\u2014which is confirmed and underscored by the\nterminological equation of voluptas (pleasure),\nbeatitudo (beatitude), fruitio (fruition),\ndelectatio (delectation), and amor (love). On the\nother hand, Valla states apodictically that there are two pleasures:\nan earthly one, which is the mother of vice, and a heavenly one, which\nis the mother of virtue; that we should abstain from the former if we\nwant to enjoy the latter; and that the natural, pre-Christian life is\n\u201cempty and worthy of punishment\u201d if not put in the wider\nperspective of human destiny. In other words, we are commanded to live\nthe arduous and difficult life of Christian honestas, ruled\nby restraint, self-denial, and propriety (temperance), and, at the\nsame time, to live a hedonist life, which consists of the joyful,\nfree, and natural gratification of the senses.\n\nAnother of his targets is the Aristotelian account of virtue as a mean\nbetween two extremes. According to Valla, each individual vice is\ninstead the opposite of an individual virtue. He makes this point by\ndistinguishing between two different senses of the same virtue,\nshowing that they have different opposites. So, while Aristotle\nregards fortitude as the mean between the vices of rashness and\ncowardice, Valla argues that there are two aspects to fortitude:\nfighting bravely and being cautious (for instance, in yielding to the\nvictorious enemy), with cowardice and rashness as their respective\nopposites. Likewise, generosity is not the mean between avarice and\nprodigality, but has two aspects: giving and not giving. Prodigality\nis the opposite of the first aspect, avarice of the second, for which\nwe should use the term frugality or thrift rather than generosity.\nMore generally, the terminology of vices as defects and excesses and\nvirtue as a mean is misleading; virtues and vices should not be ranked\n\u201caccording to whether they are at the bottom, or halfway up, or\nat the top.\u201d Interestingly, a similar critique of\nAristotle\u2019s notion of virtue as a mean between two extremes has\nbeen raised in modern scholarship (for example, by W. D. Ross).\n\nValla regards the Aristotelian notion of virtue as too static and\ninflexible, so that it does not do justice to the impulsive nature of\nour moral behavior. For him, virtue is not a habit, as Aristotle\nbelieved, but rather an affect, an emotion or feeling that can be\nacquired and lost in a moment\u2019s time. Virtue is the domain\nsolely of the will. The greatest virtue or the worse vice may arise\nout of one single act. And because virtue is painful and vice\ntempting, one may easily slide from the one into the other, unlike\nknowledge, which does not turn into ignorance all of a sudden. Valla\ntherefore frequently removes the notions of knowledge, truth, and\nprudence from the sphere of moral action. Virtues as affects are\nlocated in the rear part of the soul, the will, while the domains of\nknowledge, truth, and opinion reside in the other two faculties,\nmemory and reason (Repastinatio, 1:73\u201374; DD\n1:130). This is not to say that the will is independent from the\nintellectual capacities. The affects need reason as their guide, and\nthe lack of such guidance can result in vice. But Valla is not\nentirely clear as to what element we should assign the moral\nqualification \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad.\u201d He identifies\nvirtues with affects, and says that only these merit praise and blame\n(Repastinatio, 1:74; DD 1:130\u201332); however, he also\nwrites that the virtues, as affects, cannot be called good or bad in\nthemselves, but that these judgments apply only to the will, that is,\nto the will\u2019s choice. This is underlined by his remark that\nvirtue resides in the will rather than in an action\n(Repastinatio, 1:77; DD 1:136). In his discussion of\nthe soul, however, he frequently calls reason the will\u2019s guide\n(e.g., Valla Repastinatio, 1:75; DD 1:132), and also\nsays that the affects should follow reason, so that it, too, may be\nheld responsible, in the final analysis, for moral behavior (even\nthough he also explicitly denies that the will is determined by\nreason). Finally, pleasure, delectation, or beatitude are also called\nvirtue by the equation of virtue with love and with charity\n(Repastinatio, 1:85; DD 1:150\u201352).\n\nMoreover, Valla\u2019s insistence on the will as the locus of moral\nbehavior seems compromised by the predestinarianism advocated by the\ninterlocutor \u201cLorenzo\u201d in his dialogue De libero\narbitrio (On Free Will). In this highly rhetorical work,\nValla\u2014if we can assume that Lorenzo represents Valla\u2019s own\nposition\u2014stresses that in his inscrutable wisdom God hardens the\nhearts of some, while saving those of others. We do not know why, and\nit is presumptuous and vain to inquire into the matter. Yet, somehow\nwe do have free will, \u201cNow, indeed, He brings no necessity, and\nHis hardening one and showing another mercy does not deprive us of\nfree will, since He does this most wisely and in full holiness\u201d\n(Valla 1948, 177). So, we are free, after all, and God\u2019s\nforeknowledge does not necessitate the future; but how exactly Valla\nthinks his views settle these issues is not clear. His fideistic point\nis that we humans cannot settle the issue; \u2018the cause of the\ndivine will which hardens one and shows mercy to another is known\nneither to man nor to angels\u2019. Yet, in spite of his fideism and\nanti-intellectualism, his own discussion of God and free will, as well\nas his account of the Trinity in the Repastinatio, makes\nsubstantive claims about what God is.\n\nIn conclusion, Valla\u2019s moral thought can be described\u2014with\nsome justice\u2014as hedonistic, voluntarist, and perhaps also\nempirical (in the sense of taking account of how people actually\nbehave). On closer inspection, however, his account seems to contain\nthe seeds of several ideas that are not so easily reconciled with one\nanother. This is doubtless due, in no small measure, to his\neclecticism, his attempt to bring into one picture Aristotelian\nethics, the Stoic virtues of Cicero, the biblical concepts of charity\nand beatitude, and the Epicurean notion of hedonist pleasure\u2014\neach with its own distinctive terminology, definitions, and\nphilosophical context.\n5. Evaluation\n\nValla\u2019s contributions to historical, classical, and biblical\nscholarship are beyond doubt, and helped to pave the way for the\ncritical textual philology of Poliziano, Erasmus, and later\ngenerations of humanists. Valla grasped the important\ninsight\u2014which was not unknown to medieval philosophers and\ntheologians\u2014that the meaning of a text can be understood only\nwhen it is seen as the product of its original historical and cultural\ncontext. Yet his attempt to reform or transform the scholastic study\nof language and argumentation\u2014and, indeed, their entire mode of\ndoing philosophy\u2014is likely to be met with skepticism or even\nhostility by the historian of medieval philosophy who is dedicated to\nthe argumentative rigor and conceptual analysis which are the\nhallmarks of scholastic thought. Nevertheless, while it may be true\nthat Valla\u2019s individual arguments are sometimes weak,\nsuperficial, and unfair, his critique as a whole does have an\nimportant philosophical and historical significance. The following two\npoints, in particular, should be mentioned.\n\nFirst, the humanist study of Stoicism, Epicureanism, skepticism, and\nNeoplatonism widened the philosophical horizon and eroded faith in the\nuniversal truth of Aristotelian philosophy\u2014an essential\npreparatory stage for the rise of early modern thought. In\nValla\u2019s day, Aristotle was still \u201cthe Philosopher,\u201d\nand scholastics put considerable effort into explaining his words.\nValla attacks what he sees as the ipse dixit attitude of the\nscholastics. For him, a true philosopher does not follow a single\nmaster but instead says whatever he thinks. Referring to\nPythagoras\u2019 modest claim that he was a not a wise man but a\nlover of wisdom (Repastinatio, 1:1; DD 1:2), Valla\nmaintains that he does not belong to any sect (including that of the\nskeptics) and wants to retain his independence as critical thinker.\nWhat the scholastics forget, he thinks, is that there were many\nalternatives in antiquity to the supposedly great master, many sects,\nand many other types of philosopher. In criticizing Aristotle\u2019s\nnatural philosophy, for instance, he gave vent to a sentiment which\nultimately eroded faith in the Aristotelian system. This does not,\nhowever, mean that he was developing a non-Aristotelian natural\nphilosophy; his rejection of Aristotle\u2019s account of nature was\nprimarily motivated by religious and linguistic considerations.\nIndeed, Valla\u2019s insistence on common linguistic usage, combined\nwith his appeal to common sense and his religious fervor, seems at\ntimes to foster a fideism that is at odds with an exploratory attitude\ntowards the natural world. But with hindsight we can say that\nany undermining of the faith in the exclusiveness of the\nscholastic-Aristotelian worldview contributed to its demise and,\nultimately, to its replacement by a different, mechanistic one. And\nalthough the humanist polemic was only one factor among many others,\nits role in this process was by no means negligible. Likewise, in\nattacking Peripatetic moral philosophy, Valla showed that there were\nalternatives to the Aristotelian paradigm, even though his use of\nEpicureanism and Stoicism was rhetorical rather than historical.\n\nThe second point relates to the previous one. In placing himself in\nopposition to what he regarded as the Aristotelian paradigm, Valla\noften interprets certain doctrines\u2014the syllogism, hypothetical\nsyllogism, modal propositions, and the square of contraries\u2014in\nways they were not designed for. In such cases, we can see Valla\nstarting, as it were, from the inside of the Aristotelian paradigm,\nfrom some basic assumptions and ideas of his opponents, in order to\nrefute them by using a kind of reductio ad absurdum or\nsubmitting them to his own criteria, which are external to the\nparadigm. This moving inside and outside of the Aristotelian paradigm\ncan explain (and perhaps excuse) Valla\u2019s inconsistency, for it\nis an inconsistency which is closely tied to his tactics and his\nagenda. He does not want to be consistent if this means merely obeying\nthe rules of the scholastics, which in his view amounted to rigorously\ndefining one\u2019s terms and pressing these into the straightjacket\nof a syllogistic argument, no matter what common sense and linguistic\ncustom teach us. Behind this inconsistency, therefore, lies a\nconsistent program of replacing philosophical speculation and\ntheorizing with an approach based on common linguistic practice and\ncommon sense. But arguably it has also philosophical relevance; for\nthroughout the history of philosophy a warning can be heard against\nabstraction, speculation, and formalization. One need not endorse this\ncautionary note in order to see that philosophy thrives on the\ncreative tension between, on the one hand, a tendency to abstract,\nspeculate, and formalize, and, on the other, a concern that the object\nof philosophical analysis should not be lost from sight, that\nphilosophy should not become a game of its own\u2014an abstract and\ntheoretical affair that leaves the world it purports to analyze and\nexplain far behind, using a language that can be understood only by\nits own practitioners.\n",
