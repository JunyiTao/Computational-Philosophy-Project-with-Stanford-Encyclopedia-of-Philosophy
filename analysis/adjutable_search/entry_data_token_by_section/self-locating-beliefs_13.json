    "main_text": "Self-Location in Language || Failures of the package-delivery model\n5.2 Failures of the package-delivery model\n\nLet\u2019s consider where and why the package-delivery model breaks\ndown for self-locating communication. First we\u2019ll examine cases\nin which there is clearly some self-locating communication happening,\nbut the self-locating communication isn\u2019t of the type\ncontemplated by the package-delivery model. Then we\u2019ll identify\nthe general phenomenon behind the package-delivery model\u2019s\nfailure to happily account for these cases.\n\nWhen Muhammad Ali says \u201cI am the greatest\u201d, he\u2019s\ndefinitely giving voice to his self-locating doxastic state (which\nLewis would characterize as self-attributing being the\ngreatest), but that doxastic state is not, and is not intended to\nbe, transferred to his interlocutors. Ali wants his interlocutors to\nget in to the \u201cMuhammad Ali is the greatest\u201d doxastic\nstate, not the \u201cI am the greatest\u201d doxastic state. And\nit\u2019s the former, not the latter, that addressees who take Ali at\nhis word will in fact get themselves into.\n\nSimilarly, when Bob seeks to resolve Lingens\u2019 uncertainty by\nsaying to him, \u201cyou are Rudolph Lingens\u201d, his\ncommunicative aim is to get Lingens into the \u201cI am Rudolph\nLingens\u201d doxastic state. But Bob, being no fool, is not himself\nin the self-locating doxastic state that he\u2019s aiming to produce\nin his interlocutor.\n\nIn each of these cases, the communication that takes place is\ndifficult to straightforwardly characterize on a belief\ntransfer/package-delivery model. The doxastic state that the\ncooperative, credulous addressee gets into is not the same as the\nself-locating state that motivates the sincere speaker\u2019s\nutterance, and which the speaker demonstrates or gives voice to by way\nof the utterance.\n\nThis shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise, and it doesn\u2019t result\nfrom a quirk or shortcoming of one particular human language, or of\nactual human languages as compared to other possible types of\nlanguage. There is an in-principle problem with package-delivery\ncommunication of interestingly self-locating doxastic states.\nPrecisely because they\u2019re interestingly self-locating, such\ndoxastic states aren\u2019t the sort of thing that can uniformly be\ntransmitted from speaker to addressee without leading addressees into\nerror. This is easiest to see in an extreme case: It\u2019s great for\nDavid Hume to be in the \u201cI am David Hume\u201d doxastic state.\nIt\u2019s not so great for anybody else to be in that state, and\nit\u2019s not great for Hume to put his interlocutors in that state\nby communicating it package-delivery style.\n\nA somewhat less extreme example: Suppose I\u2019m in the \u201cmy\npants are on fire\u201d doxastic state. I want to communicate my\nplight to you so that you\u2019ll give me a bucket of water, or a\nfire extinguisher. I don\u2019t want to get you into the \u201cmy\npants are on fire\u201d state\u2014that won\u2019t enlist your help\nin my pants-extinguishing project, and it will give you inaccurate\nbeliefs, since your pants (we may suppose) are not on fire.\nSo communicating my self-locating belief via belief transfer will not\nachieve my communicative goals.\n\nI want to get you into some other doxastic state. Getting you\ninto the \u201cthe pants of the guy addressing me are on fire\u201d\nstate would likely do the trick, as would getting you into the\n\u201cAndy\u2019s pants are on fire\u201d state. The communicative\neffect of saying \u201cmy pants are on fire\u201d is not what would\nbe predicted by a view on which that sentence\u2019s conventional\ncommunicative role is to ensure that both speaker and addressee are in\nthe \u201cmy pants are on fire\u201d doxastic state.\n\nThe situation is similar for very many indexical sentences\u2014their\nproduction is clearly motivated (in standard cases) by a particular\nself-locating doxastic state, but their communicative role is\nemphatically not to bring it about that that doxastic state\nis shared by both speaker and addressee. The communicative role of\n(uses of) typical indexical sentences is not to deliver a\nself-locating doxastic package from speaker to addressee.\n",
