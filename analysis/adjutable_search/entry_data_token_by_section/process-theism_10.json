    "main_text": "Transforming Traditional Theism and Process Theism\n9. Arguments for the Existence of God in Process Theism\n\nOur task has been to explain the concept of process theism, not to\nargue that the God of process theism exists. Nevertheless, a few words\nare in order about the approaches that process theists take to\njustifying belief in the existence of God. We noted in opening that\nprocess theism does not privilege claims to special insight or\nrevealed truth (cf. Keller 2007, chapter 6). This is not to say that\nsome theologians have not found process thought congenial to their\ninterests (e.g., Ogden 1963; Cobb 1965; Griffin 1973). Whitehead and\nHartshorne did not view themselves as apologists for a particular\nfaith, but neither did they simply dismiss religious experiences as\nuninformative. Whitehead warns against narrowness in the selection of\nevidence. He says, \u201cPhilosophy may not neglect the\nmultifariousness of the world\u2014the fairies dance, and Christ is\nnailed to the cross\u201d (Whitehead 1929 [1978, 338]). They add, however,\nthat the claims that religious people make, individually (as in the\ncase of mystics) or collectively (as in the case of religious\norganizations), are subject to human fallibility. There may be a God\nwho is infallible but human beings are not, and every putative\nrevelation is sifted through an imperfect human filter (Hartshorne\n1984a, 41). As far as justifying religious belief is concerned,\nWhitehead and Hartshorne try to navigate between appeals to blind\nfaith and knock-down proof. In metaphysics, says Whitehead, \u201cThe\nproper test is not that of finality, but of progress\u201d (Whitehead\n1929 [1978, 14]).\n\nIf process theism is not based on revelation, neither is it based on\nna\u00efve appeals to science, including the social sciences. It is no\nmore characteristic of process thought to give a\n\u201cscientific\u201d argument for the existence of God than to\ngive a reductionistic account of religious belief by means of a theory\nin sociology, psychology, or more broadly, what F. LeRon Shults calls\n\u201cthe biocultural study of religion\u201d (Shults 2018). As far\nas Whitehead and Hartshorne are concerned, the working assumptions of\nthe sciences are no more or less open to question and clarification\nthan the working assumptions of religion. Process thought teaches a\nmodest skepticism about the competencies of science that is arguably\nin the spirit of science itself. Indeed, the theory of actual entities\nand their prehensions is Whitehead\u2019s alternative to the\nmetaphysical worldview that developed as a result of the dramatic\nsuccesses of early modern science\u2014Whitehead calls it\n\u201cscientific materialism.\u201d The theory of actual entities is\na response to the idea that the \u201cstuff\u201d of which the world\nis made is devoid of mind-like qualities\u2014Whitehead refers to\nthis as \u201cvacuous actuality.\u201d The theory of prehensions is\na response to the idea that bits of matter can exist at definite\nplaces and times without any essential reference to other places and\ntimes\u2014Whitehead refers to this as \u201csimple location.\u201d\nThe fact is that Whitehead wrote relatively little about God and a\ngreat deal about how his philosophy of organism resolves problems of\nmetaphysics and epistemology inherited from a prior age.\n\nProcess theism is not based on religious doctrine or theology and it\nis not a scientific theory; it is a product of metaphysics, or what\nWhitehead calls \u201cspeculative philosophy.\u201d It is, however,\nmetaphysics \u201cin a new key,\u201d to borrow a phrase from\nSusanne Langer. Whitehead says that, \u201cSpeculative philosophy is\nthe endeavour to frame a coherent, logical, necessary system of\ngeneral ideas in terms of which every element of our experience can be\ninterpreted\u201d (Whitehead 1929 [1978, 3]). Metaphysics, so defined, is an\naudacious enterprise, for experience is open-ended and every claim to\nknowledge is perspectival and conditioned. If metaphysicians strive\nfor a comprehensive vision of things, they must continually remind\nthemselves that there is no standpoint within the world from which to\nspeak confidently for eternity. Whitehead and Hartshorne reject the\nidea that metaphysics proceeds best by deducing theorems from\nself-evident axioms. To be sure, inferences must be made from the\ncategories of one\u2019s metaphysics, but it is the categories\nthemselves that are continually on trial. The court in which\nmetaphysical proposals are judged is the community of philosophers,\nstretching through history and into the future. Whitehead and\nHartshorne, heavily influenced by Plato, practice philosophy as a\ndialogue with great minds, past and present. Hartshorne, taking a page\nfrom Karl Popper, says that, \u201cObjectivity is not in the\nindividual thinker but in the process of mutual correction and\ninspiration\u201d (Hartshorne 1962, ix).\n\nWhen it comes to the \u201cGod question\u201d Whitehead says that he\nis not offering proofs. \u201cThere is merely the confrontation of\nthe theoretic system with a certain rendering of the facts\u201d\n(Whitehead 1929 [1978, 343]). Having established to his satisfaction an\nalternative to scientific materialism\u2014that is, the philosophy of\norganism\u2014he asks whether that philosophy\u2019s categories\nrequire reference to God. Ford suggests that Whitehead was surprised\nto find that they do, for he began his reflections on the philosophy\nof nature as an agnostic (Ford 1977, 27). In keeping with his\nsensitivity to the history of philosophy, Whitehead characterizes his\ndiscussion as adding another speaker to David Hume\u2019s\nDialogues Concerning Natural Religion. If Whitehead has an\n\u201cargument\u201d for the existence of God it is implicit in the\ndual attempt (1) to show the reasonableness of process metaphysics and\n(2) to show the conceptual necessity of God for its overall coherence.\nRudolf Carnap says that it is one thing to ask what one\u2019s\nmetaphysics commit one to and it is something else to ask what commits\none to one\u2019s metaphysics. Whitehead asks both questions.\n\nFord rightly says that, in Whitehead\u2019s writings, the problem and\nnature of God is nowhere explored for its own sake (Ford 1970, 393).\nMoreover, during the period when he was introducing the concept of God\ninto his metaphysics, beginning in 1925, the very concept of God was\nin flux. For these reasons, there is an inherent flexibility in\nreconstructing arguments for God\u2019s existence from\nWhitehead\u2019s work, and this is reflected in the critical\nliterature. Hartshorne identified six arguments implicit in\nWhitehead\u2019s metaphysics (Hartshorne 1972, 78\u201388), but\nothers find fewer (Sherburne 1971) or more (Griffin 2001a, chapter 5).\nFord attempted to derive the existence of God analytically, as a\ntheorem from the set of axioms in Whitehead\u2019s categoreal scheme\nin Process and Reality; his much abbreviated version of\nWhitehead\u2019s reasoning is this: \u201cActual entities either\nbelong to God or to the World. Given the World, God must exist. Given\nGod, the World must exist. Since one or the other must exist, both\nmust\u201d (Ford 1970, 393). Interestingly, the God to which\nFord\u2019s reconstructed argument concludes is a single non-temporal\nactual entity, and no mention is made of developments in\nWhitehead\u2019s idea of God after Process and Reality.\n\nMore traditional forms of reasoning can also be found in Whitehead.\nThere cannot, to be sure, be a cosmological argument in the classical\nsense for Whitehead rejects the traditional idea of divine creativity,\nbut he does see a need to explain the initial phase of each actual\nentity. In Whitehead\u2019s view, God customizes the general\npotentiality of the universe for each emergent occasion, providing it\nwith its initial aim. The graded relevance of these potentialities\nanswers to our sense that there are objectively better and worse\noptions. A related problem is how the activities of the many\nactualities that make up the cosmos happen to obey a common set of\nnatural laws. Order implies an ordering power; however, all localized\norder presupposes cosmic order; thus, order on a cosmic scale requires\na cosmic ordering power. The best candidate for the cosmic ordering\npower is God, according to Whitehead (Whitehead 1926 [1997, 104])\u2014this\nis a type of design argument. Another consideration is that the realm\nof possibility in terms of which cosmic order is conceived is akin to\nPlato\u2019s Forms. In Whitehead\u2019s system, these \u201ceternal\nobjects\u201d require an ontological ground. The primordial nature of\nGod serves this function (Whitehead 1929 [1978, 46]). Finally, the consequent\nnature of God is the explanation of the fixity of accomplished fact\nand achieved value. \u201cThe truth itself is nothing else than how\nthe composite natures of the organic actualities of the world obtain\nadequate representation in the divine nature\u201d (Whitehead 1929 [1978,\n12]). This sketch of Whitehead\u2019s reasoning may suggest that his\n\u201carguments\u201d lose their force when abstracted from his\nmetaphysics. Bowman L. Clarke, however, produced a formal theistic\nargument along Whiteheadian lines using the linguistic framework\ndeveloped by Nelson Goodman (Clarke 1966, 162\u2013164). In a\ndifferent vein, Franklin Gamwell argues that the moral law must be\ngrounded in the divine good, where the divine good is most\nparsimoniously conceived in neoclassical terms (Gamwell 1990). Another\nprocess thinker, Derek Malone-France, argues that the promise of\nKant\u2019s transcendental philosophy is best fulfilled in a\nWhiteheadian inspired theistic metaphysics (Malone-France 2007). Thus,\narguing for the existence of Whitehead\u2019s God, or something like\nWhitehead\u2019s God, need not be inextricably tied to evaluating\nWhitehead\u2019s metaphysics.\n\nThe debate among Whiteheadians over the existence of God is\ncomplicated by the fact that Whitehead\u2019s views rapidly evolved\nfrom the time he began teaching at Harvard in 1924. His view of God is\nless a completed philosophical theism than a work in progress that was\nleft to others to try to complete, and many have tried. It is worthy\nof note, however, that an influential group of scholars maintain that\nWhitehead was not true to his finer insights when he included God in\nhis metaphysical system. Donald Sherburne wrote a pivotal article in\n1967, revised in 1971, titled \u201cWhitehead without God.\u201d\nSherburne holds that God can be \u201cexorcised\u201d from\nWhitehead\u2019s metaphysics by showing that the existence of God is\ninconsistent with its categories and by demonstrating that all of the\nfunctions ascribed to deity in the system can be met in other ways.\nDonald Crosby and Frederick Ferr\u00e9 (1933\u20132013), also\nwithin the process fold, hold similar views. Ferr\u00e9 considers\ntheism \u201coptional\u201d in the sense that the premises of\ntheistic arguments are subject to competing and equally rational value\ncommitments (Ferr\u00e9 2001, 177f). One of the most careful and\npersistent critics of process theism is Robert Neville (Neville 1980).\nNeville does not argue for \u201cWhitehead without God\u201d so much\nas \u201cWhitehead without Whitehead\u2019s God.\u201d He believes\nthat Whitehead\u2019s critique of scientific materialism and his\nphilosophy of organism are basically correct, but that the ultimate\nexplanation of the universe is in a deity that wholly transcends it\nand creates it ex nihilo (Neville 1968). Griffin forcefully\ncriticized Neville\u2019s views (Griffin 2007, 186\u2013214) and\nNeville gave a spirited response (Neville 2008).\n\nHartshorne was more in the mainstream of philosophical discussions\nabout God than was Whitehead. He spoke of proofs for God\u2019s\nexistence and defended them vigorously, although he ceased calling\nthem \u201cproofs\u201d when he realized the differences between his\napproach and more traditional ones. Hartshorne is best known for his\nvoluminous writings on the ontological argument\u2014he devotes two\nbooks and numerous articles to the topic (Hartshorne 1962 &\n1965a). Despite his fondness for his revised ontological argument, he\nnever considered it sufficient unto itself to make the case for\nGod\u2019s existence. The ontological argument is one strand of a\nmultiple argument strategy\u2014which Basil Mitchell calls a\n\u201ccumulative case\u201d\u2014in which the various elements are\nmutually reinforcing.\n\nAll of the arguments are phases of one \u2018global\u2019 argument,\nthat the properly formulated theistically religious view of life\nand reality is the most intelligible, self-consistent, and\nsatisfactory one that can be conceived. (Hartshorne 1970, 276)\n\n\nHartshorne\u2019s versions of the cosmological, teleological (or\ndesign), moral, epistemic, and aesthetic arguments complete the set\nthat make up the global argument (Viney 1985).\n\nIn Hartshorne\u2019s view, the importance of the ontological argument\nis to establish that God could not exist contingently. He calls this\n\u201cAnselm\u2019s principle.\u201d If Anselm\u2019s principle is\ncorrect then if it is possible for God to exist, then God\nnecessarily exists. In Hartshorne\u2019s view, Anselm failed to make\na convincing case for God\u2019s existence because he failed to show\nthat his concept of God is coherently conceivable. Indeed, Hartshorne\nbelieves that matters are much worse for Anselm since he considers\nAnselm\u2019s form of theism to be incoherent, as we have seen.\nHartshorne believes that the other arguments in his own global\nargument make the case for God\u2019s possible existence. Contingent\nbeings require a divine necessary being (cosmological); cosmic order\nimplies a divine cosmic ordering power (design); reality should be\nconstrued as the actual content of divine knowledge (epistemic); the\nsupreme aim in life is to contribute to the divine life (moral); and\nthere is a beauty of the world as a whole that only God can enjoy\n(aesthetic). The structure of Hartshorne\u2019s argument is\nreminiscent of the elaborate case made by John Duns Scotus in De\nPrimo Principio. Of course, the God whose existence Hartshorne\nseeks to establish is one that \u201cthe subtle doctor\u201d would\nfind unacceptable.\n\nHartshorne presents each of the sub-arguments within his cumulative\ncase as a list of options from an exhaustive set, with his\nneoclassical theistic option rounding out the set. The reason for\npresenting his arguments as lists of options rather than as a series\nof disjunctive syllogisms is to avoid the pretense of offering strict\ndemonstrations. The conclusion of any valid deductive argument can be\nrejected provided one is willing to reject one or more of the\npremises. In this sense, a valid argument provides one with options\nfor belief rather than a proof of its conclusion. Hartshorne denies\nthat one can coerce belief in God with arguments. Moreover, he\nacknowledges that his own choice for neoclassical theism is not\nwithout its difficulties. He maintains, therefore, that one should\nemploy the \u201cprinciple of least paradox\u201d in assessing the\noptions. Since no metaphysical position is without its problems, it\nwill not do to argue for one\u2019s own view by finding the problems\nin the views of others. \u201cOne must decide which paradoxes are the\nreally fatal ones, in comparison with those of contending\npositions\u201d (Hartshorne 1970, 88).\n\nHartshorne presents his theistic arguments as a priori, not\nin the sense that they are conclusive demonstrations, but in the sense\nthat they aim at a conclusion about what is true in all possible\nstates of affairs. In this he is true to Whitehead\u2019s\nmetaphysical project of finding categories that are universal and\nnecessary. He insists that none of the conclusions of his arguments\nare empirical. A proposition is empirical, in Popper\u2019s sense, if\nit is falsifiable by some conceivable experience. If Anselm\u2019s\nprinciple is correct then either God exists without the possibility of\nnot existing or God\u2019s existence is impossible. Thus, if God\nexists, then no conceivable experience could falsify the statement\nthat God exists. For this reason, Hartshorne finds all empirical\narguments\u2014and hence, all scientifically based\narguments\u2014for God\u2019s existence to be fatally flawed since\nthey must conclude to that which is not God, that is, to that which\nexists contingently. Hartshorne also points out that none of his\narguments tell us anything concrete about God. True to his distinction\nbetween existence and actuality, Hartshorne maintains that the\narguments concern that which is most abstract about deity, its\nexistence and character. This is why Hartshorne claimed to know so\nvery little about God, even though he wrote so many volumes on the\nsubject (Hartshorne & Viney 2001, 46).\n\nAfter his ninetieth birthday, Hartshorne emphasized a somewhat\ndifferent approach in arguing for God\u2019s existence that\nincorporates his ideas about dual transcendence (Hartshorne 1993;\nHartshorne 2011b). He notes that from a purely formal point of view,\nany pair of metaphysical contraries may apply to God or to the world.\nFor example, either God is in different respects necessary and\ncontingent (NC), wholly necessary (N), wholly contingent (C), or\nneither necessary nor contingent (O). The same is true of the world:\nnecessary and contingent (nc), wholly necessary (n), wholly contingent\n(c), or neither necessary nor contingent (o). This yields sixteen\nformal options which Hartshorne arranges in a four by four matrix.\nHistorically significant forms of theism can be found on the\nmatrix\u2014classical theism, for example, is N.c and free will\ntheism is NC.c. Only one of the sixteen options can be true, so\nHartshorne develops criteria for judging the various possibilities.\nFor example, if the contrast itself should be preserved, then options\nlike N.n, C.c, and O.o are unacceptable. Of course, Hartshorne\u2019s\nconclusion is that NC.nc is the true option. Arguably, the value of\nthese matrices is as much in mapping concepts of God and the world as\nit is in arguing for a particular option, for they allow a more\ndetailed idea of the views that contradict one\u2019s own. Hartshorne\nmaintains that one reason classical theism remained unchallenged for\nso long was because philosophers had not considered all of the options\n(Hartshorne 1997, ch. 5). If any two matrices are combined, the number\nof formal options jumps to 256. If we generalize for any number of\npairs n, then the number of concepts of God and the world is\n16n.\n\nWe have already mentioned others within the process tradition who have\nmade the case for process theism: Clarke, Gamwell, and Malone-France.\nSchubert Ogden (1963) and David Ray Griffin (2001a and 2016) should be\nadded to the list. Griffin explicitly employs a cumulative case\ninvolving eight strands; his argument is indebted to both Whitehead\nand Hartshorne but includes his own distinctive contributions. Having\nfound the alternatives to process theism unsatisfactory, Griffin\nmaintains that \u201cprocess philosophy\u2019s naturalistic theism\nis overwhelmingly more probable than the truth of\natheism\u201d (2001a, 203). Also of note is that Griffin is one of\nthe few process philosophers to have addressed the arguments in the\nliterature of the new atheism (although, see Viney and Shields 2020,\nchapter 6).\n\nWith Hartshorne, as with Whitehead, what is at stake in theistic\narguments is less a matter of the soundness of a particular piece of\nreasoning than the assessment of an entire metaphysical system. Thus,\nthe sketch given here does not begin to do justice to their arguments.\nNevertheless, the development and defense of a concept of God that is\nfully engaged in temporal processes is perhaps the central pillar and\nthe lasting achievement of their reasoning. After all, one of the\nselling points of process theism over its rivals has been not only its\ntheoretical superiority in dealing with theological puzzles but its\nadequacy to everyday religious sensibilities. Process theists argue\nthat the deity of traditional theism is at once too active and too\nstatic. It is too active in the sense that its control of the universe\nis absolute, leaving nothing for the creatures to do except to\nunwittingly speak the lines and play the parts decided for them in\neternity. It is too static in the sense that it lacks potentiality to\nchange, to participate in the evolving universe it created, and to be\naffected by the triumphs and tragedies of its creatures. In short, it\nis a God who acts but is never acted upon and can therefore never\ninteract. This is summed up in the non-biblical Aristotelian formula\nof God as the unmoved mover. Fritz Rothschild describes the God of\nRabbi Abraham Heschel\u2014a God who feels and is felt by the\ncreatures\u2014as \u201cthe Most Moved Mover\u201d\n(Heschel 1959, 24). Hartshorne, who greatly admired Heschel, amends\nthis formula in an attempt to distill the essence of process theism,\n\u201cGod is the most and best moved mover\u201d\n(Hartshorne 1997, 6, 39).\n",
