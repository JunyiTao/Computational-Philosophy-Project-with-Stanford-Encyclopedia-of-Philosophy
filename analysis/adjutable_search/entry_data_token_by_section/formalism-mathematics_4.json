    "main_text": "Nominalist Formalism\n5. Nominalist Formalism\n\nW. V. Quine famously rejected the positivist\u2019s doctrine of truth\nin virtue of meaning and the quasi-logicist conception of mathematics\nas a body of analytic truths (and, partly as a result, also rejected\nhis mentor Carnap\u2019s internal/external distinction). Quine, in\nconjunction with Nelson Goodman, produced instead what amounts to a\nformalist manifesto. His formalist phase does not seem to have lasted\nvery long: he later settled on a form of mathematical platonism,\ndownplaying, if not largely ignoring, his relatively youthful\nflirtation with \u2018nominalism\u2019. But while it lasted he and\nGoodman greatly advanced the discussion of formalism by tackling\nhead-on the questions which other formalists shirked or ignored.\n\nGoodman and Quine\u2019s \u2018Steps towards a constructive\nnominalism\u2019 (1947) sets forth an uncompromising game\nformalism:\n\nThe gains which seem to have accrued to natural science from the use\nof mathematical formulas do not imply that these formulas are true\nstatements. No one, not even the hardiest pragmatist, is likely to\nregard the beads of an abacus as true; and our position is that the\nformulas of platonistic mathematics are, like the beads of an abacus,\nconvenient computational aids which need involve no question of truth.\n(p. 122).\n\n\nThey regard\n\nthe sentences of mathematics merely as strings of marks without\nmeaning\n\n\nso that\n\nsuch intelligibility as mathematics possesses derives from the\nsyntactical or metamathematical rules governing those marks. (p. 111)\n\n\nCommendably, Goodman and Quine do not shy away from the metatheory\nproblem, the difficulty that syntax and metamathematics itself seems\nas ontologically rich and committed to abstract objects as arithmetic.\nOn the contrary, they face it squarely and attempt to make do entirely\nwith an ontology of concrete objects, finitely many such objects in\nfact. (However they do assume fairly powerful mereological principles,\nessentially universal composition: they assume that any fusion of\nobjects, however scattered or diffuse, is also an object in good\nstanding.)\n\nWith much ingenuity they try to develop a syntax which \u201cwill\ntreat mathematical expressions as concrete objects\u201d\n(ibid.)\u2014as actual strings of physical marks\u2014and\ngive concrete surrogates for notions such as \u2018formula\u2019,\n\u2018axiom\u2019 and \u2018proof\u2019 as platonistically\ndefined. However they do not address the issue of the application of\nmathematics, construed in this concrete, formalistic fashion.\n\nIn addition to the applicability problem, there are two further\ncrucial problems for formalism as developed by Goodman and Quine.\nFirstly it is not clear that they are entitled to the general claims\nthey make about syntax, construed as a theory about certain concrete\nmarks and fusions of marks. Thus when arguing that their definition of\nformula in terms of \u2018quasi-formula\u2019 gives us the results\nwe want, they say:\n\nBy requiring also the next more complex alternative denials in\n\\(x\\) to be alternative denials of quasi-formulas, the definition\nguarantees these also will be formulas in the intuitively intended\nsense; and so on, to \\(x\\) itself. (p. 116)\n\n\n(\u2018Alternative denial\u2019 is the Sheffer stroke operation\n\\(P|Q\\) which is true if and only if one component is\nfalse.) The problem lies with the \u2018and so on\u2019. Goodman and\nQuine are trying to work their way up through an arbitrary formula\nshowing that their definition will ensure that each larger component\nis a formula. It is not clear how we can have a guarantee of this for\narbitrary \\(x\\), without something like induction over formula\ncomplexity; but this is not available as formulas are not generated in\nthe usual inductive set-theoretic fashion. Similar remarks apply to\nthe demonstration that proofs, as defined nominalistically on p. 120,\nhave the internal order of precedence among immediate sub-premisses\nand conclusions that we intuitively expect. The demonstration proceeds\nwith a generalisation over all numbers \\(k\\) which number the\naxioms in a concrete proof and then performs a sequence of selections\non them. This seems to presuppose the truth of generalisations over\nall numbers and indeed countable choice, resources unavailable to a\nstrict nominalist.\n\nSecondly, what can Goodman and Quine say about a sentence such as\n\n\\[\n2^{2^{2^{2^{ 2^2} }}}+1 \\text{ is prime}\\,?\n\\]\n\n\n(That is\u2014with \u20182^\\(n\\)\u2019 representing \u20182 to\nthe power \\(n\\)\u2019\u2014\u2018[2^(2^(2^(2^(2^2))))]\\(+1\\) is\nprime\u2019; cf. Tennant, 1997 p. 152.) They cannot deny the sentence\nexists, for there is the token before our very eyes. But there are\nstrong grounds for thinking that no concrete proof or disproof will\nexist, for the only methods available may use up more time, space and\nmaterial than any human could have at her disposal, perhaps than\nactually exists. There are countless sentences with this property:\nconcrete tokens of them exist but no concrete proof or refutation\nactually exists, none that a human could manipulate as a meaningful\nutterance anyway. (Cf. Boolos, 1987.) Formalists of Goodman and\nQuine\u2019s persuasion seem forced to the conclusion that sentences\nlike the above, sentences which are decidable in the usual formal\nsense, are neither true nor false, since neither (concretely) provable\nnor refutable. To embrace this view, however, would be to butcher\nmathematics as currently practiced; such a consequence should rather\nbe viewed as a reductio ad absurdum of their position.\n",
