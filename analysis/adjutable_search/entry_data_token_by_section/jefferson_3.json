    "main_text": "Morality || Religion and Morality\n3.1 Religion and Morality\n\nThe right to the pursuit of happiness implies too that all persons are\nfree to worship as they choose. Since religion is a matter between a\nman and his deity (e.g., TJ to Miles King, 26 Sept. 1814), no one owes\nany account of his faith to another. Moreover, legislature should make\n\u201cno law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting\nthe free exercise thereof,\u201d thus building a wall of separation\nbetween church and state ([DB]:\n 510).[7]\n\nBeing personal, religion ought not to be politicized. When the clergy\nengraft themselves into the \u201cmachine of government,\u201d they\nprove a \u201cvery formidable engine against the civil and religious\nrights of man\u201d (TJ to Jeremiah Moor, 14 Aug. 1800). All people,\nJefferson asserts, should follow the example of the Quakers: live\nwithout priests, be guided their internal monitor of right and wrong,\nand eschew matters inaccessible to common sense, for belief can only\nrightly be shaped by \u201cthe assent of the mind to an intelligible\nproposition\u201d (TJ to John Adams, 22 Aug. 1813).\n\nThe true principles of morality are the \u201cmild and simple\nprinciples of the Christian philosophy\u201d (TJ to Gerry Elbridge,\n29 Mar. 1801)\u2014the principles common to all right-intended\nreligions. Jefferson writes to Thomas Leiper (21 Jan. 1809):\n\n\nMy religious reading has long been confined to the moral branch of\nreligion, which is the same in all religions; while in that branch\nwhich consists of dogmas, all differ, all have a different set. The\nformer instructs us how to live well and worthily in society; the\nlatter are made to interest our minds in the support of the teachers\nwho inculcate\n them.[8]\n\n\nThus, the principles common to all religions are few, exoteric, and\nthe true principles of\n morality.[9]\n\nThough chary of sectarian religion due to the empleomania of sectarian\nclerics and a sharp critic of Christianity in his youth ([NR]),\n\u201cChristianity,\u201d deterged of its political trappings and\nmetaphysical twaddle, in time became special to Jefferson (e.g., TJ to\nJohn Adams, 12 Oct. 1813 and 24 Jan. 1814). He states to Dr. Benjamin\nRush (21 Apr. 1803):\n\n\nI am a Christian, in the only sense [Jesus] wished any one to be;\nsincerely attached to his doctrines, in preference to all others;\nascribing to him every human excellence; & believing he\nnever claimed any other.\n\n\nJesus\u2019 teachings make up the greatest moral system, and Jesus is\n\u201cthe greatest of all the [religious]\n reformers.\u201d[10]\n To Benjamin Waterhouse (26 June 1822), Jefferson writes:\n\n\nThe doctrines of Jesus are simple, and tend all to the happiness of\nman. 1. That there is one only God, and he all perfect. 2. That there\nis a future state of rewards and punishments. 3. That to love God with\nall thy heart and thy neighbor as thyself, is the sum of religion.\n\n\n\nConsequently, Jesus\u2019 message comprises love of god (being one,\npace Calvin, not three), love of mankind, and belief in an\nafterlife of reward or punishment.\n\nYet much in the Bible, Jefferson thought, was redundant, hyperbolic,\nbathetic, absurd, and beyond the bounds of physical possibility (e.g.,\nTJ to John Adams, 28 Oct. 1813). That was confirmed by inspection of a\nlate-in-life \u201charmony\u201d Jefferson constructed, The Life\nand Morals of Jesus of Nazareth (1820), in which the virgin\nbirth, miraculous cures, and resurrection were excised. Christ was\nneither the savior of mankind nor the son of God, but the great moral\nreformer of the Jewish religion([B]).\n\nEven after he purged the Bible of its corruptions\u2014in his own\nwords, after he plucked, in an oft-used metaphor, the diamonds from\nthe dungheap (TJ to John Adams, 12 Oct. 1813, and TJ to )\u2014to try\nboth to make plain Jesus\u2019 true teachings and to give a credible\naccount of the life of Jesus, Jefferson did not completely follow\nJesus\u2019 uncontaminated teachings. He did think love of God was\nneeded for one to be of upstanding virtue, for each could see and feel\nthe existence of deity in the cosmos. Thus, atheists, however\nostensibly virtuous, suffered from a defect of moral sensibility. Yet\nwhen Jefferson expressed his own view on the branches of morality\n(true religion), he did not mention belief in an afterlife, as did\n Jesus.[11]\n His 1814 letter to Law (13 June) mentions belief in an afterlife\nmerely as one of the correctives to lack of a moral sense, along with\nself-interest, the approbation of others upon doing good, and the\nrewards and punishments of laws. Given that, along with his\nout-and-out commitment to materialism and given the evidence of four\nletters that unequivocally express skepticism apropos of an\n afterlife,[12]\n and given that he and his wife wrote about the \u201ceternal\nseparation\u201d they were about to make on her deathbed, it is\nprobable, asserts one scholar, that he did not believe in an afterlife\n(Holowchak 2019a, pp. 128\u20132). So, belief in an afterlife, one of\nthe chief teachings of Jesus, was likely not an essential part of\nmorality for Jefferson. In contrast, Charles Sanford, noting that\nJefferson appeals to the hereafter in several letters and addresses,\noffers a small-step argument in defense of belief in an afterlife.\n\u201c\u2018The prospects of a future state of retribution for the\nevil as well as the good done while here\u2019 [are] among the moral\nforces necessary to motivate individuals to live good lives in\nsociety.\u201d He adds: \u201cJefferson had begun with the\nconviction that God had created in man a hunger for the rights of\nequality, freedom, and life and a desire to follow God\u2019s moral\nlaw. It was only a small step further to believe that God had also\ncreated man with an immortal soul\u201d\n (152).[13]\n\nFinally, Jefferson later in life claimed to be a Unitarian. What did\n\u201cUnitarianism\u201d mean for him?\n\nJefferson finds the notion of three deities in one inscrutable, and\ntherefore physically impossible. Here he falls back on his naturalism.\nHe allows nothing inconsistent with the laws of nature, gleaned\nthrough experience. The sort of Unitarianism Jefferson promotes is not\na religious sect, but instead a manner of approaching religion. Of his\nUnitarianism, Jefferson asserts to John Adams (22 Aug. 1813),\n\u201cWe should all then, like the Quakers, live without an order of\npriests, moralize for ourselves, follow the oracle of conscience, and\nsay nothing about what no man can understand, nor therefore\nbelieve.\u201d To Dr. Thomas Cooper (2 Nov. 1822), Jefferson\ncontrasts Unitarians with sectarian preachers, so Unitarians can be\ngrasped as persons living fully in accordance with the dictates of\ntheir moral sense faculty. To Benjamin Waterhouse (8 Jan. 1825),\nJefferson states that Unitarianism is \u201cprimitive Christianity,\nin all the simplicity in which it came from the lips of Jesus.\u201d\nSuch letters show plainly that monotheism, incomplexity, and\nnon-sectarianism are dependent issues. Jefferson made purchase of\nmonotheism because it and benevolence were key tenets of Jesus\u2019\nuncorrupted teachings. Those two tenets, letters indicate, were the\nframework of his Unitarianism, or of any right religion.\n",
