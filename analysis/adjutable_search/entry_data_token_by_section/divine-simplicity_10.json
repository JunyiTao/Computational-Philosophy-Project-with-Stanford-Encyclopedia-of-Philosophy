An alienans adjective is one\nthat shifts, alters, alienates, the sense of the noun that it\nmodifies. Thus \u2018decoy\u2019 in \u2018decoy duck\u2019 is an\nalienans adjective: from the fact that a thing is a decoy\nduck one cannot infer that it is a duck in the way in which one can\ninfer from the fact that a thing is a male duck that it is a duck. So\nif \u2018perfectly\u2019 in \u2018perfectly powerful\u2019 is an\nalienans adjective, then God can be perfectly powerful\nwithout being powerful, and the above objection to DDS collapses.\n\nAt first glance, this may appear to be a senseless suggestion. Power\nis an attribute that admits of degrees. Perfect power is therefore\nquite naturally viewed as the maximal degree of power. So viewed,\nperfect power is generically identical with any submaximal degree of\npower. According to Miller, however, there is an important distinction\nbetween a limit simpliciter and a limit case. A limit simpliciter\ndiffers merely in degree from that of which it is the limit\nsimpliciter, whereas a limit case differs absolutely from that of\nwhich it is the limit case. Thus the limit simpliciter of an\nF is an F, while the limit case of an F is\nnot an F. What Miller argues is that the divine perfections\nare limit cases, not limits simpliciter, of such properties as power\nand knowledge. As such, they have nothing generically in common with\nthe corresponding attributes in creatures.\n\nTo appreciate the limit simpliciter/limit case distinction, consider\nthe speed of moving bodies. It has an upper limit, the speed of light.\nThis is a limit simpliciter. But the lower limit, namely the speed 0\nkm/sec, is a limit case and not a limit simpliciter. Whereas the upper\nlimit simpliciter is a speed, the lower limit case is not a speed. A\nparticle moving at 0 km/sec is not moving. For a second example,\nconsider the series: 3-place predicable, 2-place predicable, 1-place\npredicable. Since a predicable (e.g., \u201c___ is wise\u201d) must\nhave at least one place to be a predicable, a 1-place predicable is a\nlimit simpliciter of the ordered series of predicables.\nAlthough talk of zero-place predicables comes naturally, as when we\nspeak of a proposition as a zero-place predicable, a zero-place\npredicable is no more a predicable than negative growth is growth.\n\u201cZero-place\u201d is an alienans adjective like\n\u201cnegative\u201d in \u201cnegative growth.\u201d So a\nzero-place predicable is not a limit simpliciter of the series in\nquestion, but a limit case of this series: it is not a member\nof the series of which it is the limit case. It nevertheless stands in\nsome relation to the members of the series inasmuch as they and the\nway they are ordered point to the limit case (Miller 1996, p.\n8).\n\nThe idea, then, is that God\u2019s power is not the maximum, or limit\nsimpliciter, of an ordered series of instances of power, but the limit\ncase of power. This implies that God\u2019s power is not an\ninstance of power any more than a zero-place predicable is a\npredicable. No doubt this will surprise the perfect-being theologians,\nbut, in mitigation, it can be said that God\u2019s power, though not\nan instance of power, is that to which the ordered series of\npower-instances points, and is therefore something to which\nthe members of that series stand in a definite relation.\n\nMiller\u2019s approach allows us to reject the premise of the above\nargument. The premise stated in effect that anything that is perfectly\npowerful is powerful. But if Miller is right, and God\u2019s power is\nnot the limit simpliciter of an ordered series of instances of power,\nand thus itself an instance of power, but is instead a limit\ncase of power, then what is perfectly powerful need not be an\ninstance of power.\n",
