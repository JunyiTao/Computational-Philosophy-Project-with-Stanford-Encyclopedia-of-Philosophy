    "main_text": "The New Traditionalism || Two concerns about the narrative\n8.2 Two concerns about the narrative\n\n\nThe MacIntyrean narrative is intriguing but highly\ncontroversial. Liberal critics have raised the following two\nobjections to it.\n\n\n The first feature of the narrative to which\nliberal critics have drawn attention is its highly intellectualized\ncharacter. If John Milbank and MacIntyre are correct, for\nexample, the fall into secularist liberalism is driven by the influence\nof some fairly abstract philosophical claims about the nature of reason\nand existence, which were defended by the medieval philosopher Duns\nScotus. By rejecting the broadly Augustinian/Thomistic picture of\nreason and existence, the New Traditionalists claim, Scotus paved the\nway for the rise of secularism, which is endemic to contemporary\nliberal democracies (see Milbank 1990 and MacIntyre 1990, Ch.\n7).\n\n\n Liberal critics maintain that, as a matter\nof intellectual history, this is not correct. Proponents of\nbroadly Scotistic or anti-theistic views, according to thinkers such as\nStout, never had the numbers or clout to change the world as\ndramatically as New Traditionalists claim. In fact, if Stout is\ncorrect, there is a counter-narrative to tell that is at least as\nplausible as the one that New Traditionalists champion. According\nto this counter-narrative, we should distinguish two types of\nsecularism: on the one hand, there is secularism as understood by the\nstandard view, which tells us that appeal to religious reasons in\npublic political discourse is insufficient to justify coercive\nlaws. On the other, there is broadly pluralistic secularism,\nwhich tells us merely that participants in public political discourse\nare not in a position to assume that their interlocutors are making the\nsame religious assumptions that they are. Stout maintains that\nliberal democracy is committed only to secularism of the second\nsort. Indeed, even critics of the standard view who affirm\nliberal democracy on religious grounds, such as Wolterstorff, grant\nthat liberal democracy is secular in Stout's second, pluralistic\nsense. Certainly, the liberal critics maintain, there is nothing\nabout liberalism that commits it to a version of secularism in which\nthe liberal state is an anti-Christian ecclesia or an alternate vehicle\nfor salvation, as some New Traditionalists have claimed (see, for\nexample, Milbank, et al. 1999, 192).\n\n\n Suppose that the liberal critics are\ncorrect in their contention that liberal democracy is committed only to\npluralistic secularism. Is this commitment the upshot of a broadly\nScotistic view about reason and existence having taken root in\nmodernity? If thinkers such as Stout and Wolterstorff are\ncorrect, the answer to this question is also: no. Rather, both\nStout and Wolterstorff suggest that liberal democracy's commitment to\nsecularism is the result of Christians themselves recognizing that\npost-Reformation Christianity itself had become so fragmented that\nChristians could no longer appeal to scripture and tradition in public\ndiscourse under the assumption that their interlocutors would share\ntheir views regarding scripture and tradition (see Zagorin\n2003).\n\n\n In support of this contention, Stout\nappeals to the historian Christopher Hill who maintains that in\n17th century English parliamentary politics, one\nincreasingly finds members of parliament appealing rather less to\nscripture when engaging in public political discourse and rather more\nto considerations upon which they and their interlocutors could\nagree. According to this counter-narrative, \u201csecularization was\nnot primarily brought about by the triumph of a secularist\nideology\u2026.What drove the secularization of political discourse\nforward was the increasing need to cope with religious plurality\ndiscursively on a daily basis under circumstances where improved\ntransportation and communication were changing the political and\neconomic landscape\u201d (Stout 2004, 102). To which Stout adds that\nsecularization (in the second, pluralistic sense specified earlier)\nthus understood doesn't morally or pragmatically preclude citizens from\nvoicing their religious convictions in the public square. Martin\nLuther King Jr.'s appeals to religious considerations, for example,\nwere highly politically effective.\n\n\n The first worry regarding the New\nTraditionalists' declinist narrative, then, is that it is overly\nintellectualized, portraying the rise of secularism as owing primarily\nto the influence of philosophical ideas and not to more mundane\nsociological facts, such as the need to cope with increasing religious\npluralism. The second worry about the narrative is that the New\nTraditionalists misdiagnose the character of liberal democracy,\nattributing to its advocates commitments that they needn't\naccept. To better understand this worry, recall the pattern of\nargument that the New Traditionalists employ, which is roughly the\nfollowing:\n\n\nLiberalism is committed to various philosophical claims and\npractices that are incompatible with orthodox theism (or at least\northodox theism in its best forms, such as Thomism).\n\n\nSo, orthodox theists should reject liberalism.\n\n\nWhat are some of the claims and practices that fit poorly with\northodox theism and to which liberalism is committed? If the New\nTraditionalists are correct, at least these two: first, liberalism\ntells us that political systems should be neutral regarding various\nnotions of God and the good; they should not operate with an account of\nan overriding good for human beings in whose light subsidiary goods can\nbe ordered. Second, liberalism is committed to the claim that\nmoral and political discourse should be couched not primarily in terms\nof the virtues, but individual rights. This, say the New\nTraditionalists has rendered liberal democracies a breeding ground for\ncitizens who are individualistic, self-focused, and whose views and\nbehavior are destructive of community. According to the New\nTraditionalists, these two claims are connected. It is because\nliberal democracies do not operate with a thick notion of the good that\nthe language of rights has supplanted that of virtue. For in\norder for the language of the virtues to be intelligible, it must be\ngrounded in a thick account of the good.\n\n\n When properly qualified, liberal critics\nsuch as Stout are willing to grant the first of these claims:\nliberalism does not in fact operate with a thick notion of the\ngood. But they reject the further claim that this has rendered\nappeal to the virtues in a liberal democracy irrelevant or somehow\ndeeply conceptually confused. For consider, Stout argues,\nchampions of liberalism within the broadly pragmatist tradition, such\nas Walt Whitman and John Dewey. These thinkers do not fit well\ninto the MacIntyrean paradigm. At their best, Stout maintains,\nWhitman and Dewey consciously theorize from the perspective of a\nbroadly pragmatic tradition that is committed to the centrality of the\nvirtues, albeit within a society characterized by competing and rival\nconceptions of God and the good.\n\n\n More specifically, Stout maintains that\naccording to pragmatist liberals such as Dewey, good citizens of a\nliberal democracy aspire to express not only civility and respect in\npublic political discourse, but also to accept some measure of\nresponsibility for the conditions of society and the political\narrangements it makes for itself. And to do this, citizens must\nreason with one another about the ethical issues that divide them and\nhold each other responsible, in ways that are decent and fair, for what\nis done and said. If the pragmatist liberals are right, reasoning\nof this sort requires that citizens of liberal democracies display\nvirtues of various sorts, such as openness to the views of others,\nproper respect for their positions, and so forth. In an inversion\nof the MacIntyrean position, Stout contends that it is at least in part\nbecause liberal democracies do not espouse some overarching, thick\nconception of the good that virtues such as civility and respect are\nespecially called for. And, particularly important for our\ndiscussion is Stout's further claim that pragmatism of this variety\nneedn't lend any support to the standard view. Expressing the\nvirtues of civility and respect is perfectly compatible with appealing\nonly to religious considerations when making and supporting political\ndecisions.\n\n\nSo, if the liberal critics are correct, one place to press the New\nTraditionalists' narrative is its claim that only within a thick,\noverarching account of the human good are the virtues\nintelligible. There is, however, a second place to press the\nnarrative, which is its skepticism about rights. As intimated\nearlier, MacIntyre and the New Traditionalists portray individual\nrights claims as both false and dangerous, indeed, as the upshot of an\nEnlightenment conception of morality that is inimical to a properly\nreligious way of life (see MacIntyre 1984 and 1983).\nMacIntyre, for example, writes that not only are rights claims on par\nwith belief in \u201cwitches and unicorns,\u201d but also that:\n\n\nthere is no expression in any ancient or medieval language correctly\ntranslated by our expression \u2018a right\u2019 until near the close of the\nmiddle ages: the concept lacks any means of expression in Hebrew,\nGreek, Latin, or Arabic, classical or medieval, before about 1400, let\nalone in Old English or Japanese even as late as the mid-nineteenth\ncentury. (MacIntyre 1984, 69)\n\n\nIn reply, the liberal critics make two points. First, as a\nmatter of historical fact, it is simply false that rights claims have\ntheir conceptual roots in the soil of late medieval nominalism and\nEnlightenment morality, as MacIntyre claims. Rather, as\nWolterstorff argues, appeals to rights are ubiquitous throughout\nhistory. One can find them, for example, in the ancient Romans\njuridical documents such as Justinian's Digest, the writings\nof the church fathers, and the work of the medieval canon\n lawyers.[17]\nIndeed,\naccording to Wolterstorff, appeals to what we call inherent or natural\nhuman rights can be traced back to the Hebrew and Christian scriptures\n(see Wolterstorff 2008, Pts. I-II). If Wolterstorff is correct,\nthe scriptural tradition not only birthed our conception of inherent\nhuman rights, but also provides the conceptual soil most conducive to\nits survival, for it offers the most cogent account of the worth of\nhuman beings. If this is true, according to Wolterstorff, there\nis no incompatibility between the liberal tradition's reliance on\nrights and a commitment to orthodox theism. To reject liberalism\nbecause it is committed to and relies heavily on the notion of rights\nwould be a mistake.\n\n\nSecond, the liberal critics contend that any connection between the\nappeals to rights in liberalism, on the one hand, and a tendency toward\nindividualism in its citizens, on the other, is highly\ncontingent. Perhaps it is true that contemporary liberal\ndemocracies have in fact had a strong tendency to promote\nindividualism, where this is understood as a person's having a\ndistorted focus on her rights to the exclusion of her\nobligations and responsibilities to others. But if we construe a\nliberal democracy minimally, as a political structure that effectively\nprotects a certain schedule of individual rights (to religious freedom,\nspeech, due process, and the like), it is plausible to suppose that\nexclusive focus on individual rights is itself a betrayal of\nliberalism. After all, claim-rights almost always have\ncorrelative obligations: if you have a right to religious\nfreedom, then I have an obligation not to violate that\nright. Furthermore, I also have an obligation to take feasible\nmeasures to support political institutions that protect that\nright. Any understanding of a liberal democracy according to\nwhich citizens may insist on their rights without due regard for the\nobligations they bear to others and social institutions that protect\nthese rights is arguably both incoherent and a betrayal of basic\nliberal commitments. Thinkers such as Wolterstorff add that for\ntheists who affirm liberal democracy, it is natural to suppose that\ncitizens who ignore their obligations to respect the rights of their\ncompatriots thereby also violate God's rights. For,\naccording to these thinkers, God has a right to be obeyed, and God\ndemands that we respect the worth of each human being. If the\nliberal critics are correct, then, any individualism that attends\nliberal democracy is a corruption. Perhaps it is a corruption to\nwhich liberal democracies are prone; but individualism is neither a\nliberal commitment nor, if thinkers such as Stout and Wolterstorff are\ncorrect, an inevitable manifestation of liberal commitments.\n\n\n The liberal critics, then, are highly\nsuspicious of the New Traditionalists' narrative and the philosophical\nlessons they glean from it. But suppose, for argument's sake,\nthat the narrative is largely compelling. Even if it is\ncompelling, the liberal critics insist that the New Traditionalists\nhave ignored an important option, viz., a minimalist account of liberal\ndemocracy. According to this position, liberalism is committed to\nthe following pair of theses. First, the state is to be neutral\nwith respect to different conceptions of the good. The neutrality\nin question, however, is inclusive in nature. It does not rule\nout the appeal to comprehensive conceptions of the good when making\nfundamental political decisions. Rather, it only rules out the\nclaim that the state is committed to promoting one such\nconception. Second, the state is to protect a schedule of basic\nrights and liberties enjoyed by all its citizens. Its role is to\nensure that its citizens can enjoy such goods as freedom of religion,\nfreedom of conscience, and equality before the law.\n\n\n The liberal critics maintain that a view\nsuch as this deserves serious consideration by both defenders of the\nstandard view and orthodox religious believers. The challenge\nthat liberal critics such as Stout and Wolterstorff pose to New\nTraditionalists in particular is this: Given that moral and religious\npluralism are here to stay, why would Christians and other people of\nfaith want to reject minimal liberal democracy\u2014liberal\ndemocracy shorn of its commitment to the standard view? What\nmorally feasible alternative is there to a political order in which the\nstate employs its coercive powers to protect the rights of each of its\ncitizens?\n\n\n Proponents of the New Traditionalism\nfind this attempt on the part of the liberal critics to marry liberal\ndemocracy with traditional religious belief na\u00efve. If they\nare right, any political system that professes neutrality with respect\nto conceptions of God and the good is unacceptable. At best, it\nwill be inhospitable soil for a genuinely virtuous and religious way of\nlife. At worst, any such system will be an attempt to conceal the\nfact that the deep structure of liberal democracy, with its emphasis on\npersonal freedoms and procedural justice, fits poorly with the thick\naccount of the good that orthodox religious believers endorse.\nAccording to these thinkers, the conflict between liberal democracy and\ntraditional religion runs too deep for appeals to minimalist accounts\nof liberalism to be effective.\n",
