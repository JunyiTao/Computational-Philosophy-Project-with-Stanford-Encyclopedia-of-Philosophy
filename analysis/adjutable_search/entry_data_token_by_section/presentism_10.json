    "main_text": "Truth and Truth-Making\n6. Truth and Truth-Making\n\nA good deal of work on presentism in the philosophy of time concerns\nitself with truth. In the current context, the work in question\nfocuses on whether (and, if so, how) presentism can account for the\ndifferent kinds of true proposition that we endorse. Our primary focus\nwill be on how to defend presentism whilst giving appropriate\nontological explanations for the truth of true claims about past\nthings (with the \u201ctruth-making\u201d literature as the\nbackground). We also briefly address a related problem of truths about\nspans of time, which is sometimes treated as a separate issue\nconcerning quantification over times.\n\nWe turn to one of the most discussed challenges to presentism in the\ncontemporary debate: the truth-maker objection to presentism. At first\npass, this objection is another instance of the general problem of\ncross-temporal relations\n (\u00a74),\n but there are reasons for thinking that concerns about truth-makers\nunderwrite a special problem for presentists. This objection is\ntreated as a significant problem for presentism by many, including but\nnot limited to: Sider (2001: 35\u201342), Armstrong (2004:\n145\u201350), Keller (2004), Crisp (2007), Cameron (2011), Sanson\n& Caplan (2010), Markosian (2013), Tallant & Ingram (2015),\nand Emery (2020). For one general discussion of the problem, see\nCaplan & Sanson (2011). [See the entry on\n truthmakers\n for background.]\n\nThe truth-maker objection is presented as a tension between three\nindependently plausible principles: (i) presentism, (ii) that there\nare (evidence-transcendent and objective) truths about the past, and\n(iii) truth-maker theory, the view that truths about the past are\n\u201cmade true\u201d by some existent (see, e.g., Keller\n2004: 85\u201387; Cameron 2011: 55\u201357; Tallant & Ingram\n2015: 355, for this mode of presentation). Obviously, we cannot defend\npresentism and abandon (i). Further, rejecting (ii) seems a steep\nprice to pay (cf. Dawson 2021; Miller forthcoming). If there are no\ntruths about the past, then it\u2019s hard to make sense of the idea\nthat things change from moment to moment (or that time passes; see\n \u00a77).\n That leaves us with (iii). Here, three options present themselves:\nlocate the required truth-makers, deny that truths about the past\nrequire truth-makers, or argue that truth-making isn\u2019t the kind\nof relation that requires the existence of both relata. We consider\nthese options in turn.\n\nNote that a version of this problem can be stated with the principle\nthat \u201ctruth supervenes upon being\u201d in place of truth-maker\ntheory (as in Kierland & Monton 2007). It\u2019s far more common\nto raise this objection as a problem about a lack of truth-makers\n(rather than the lack of an appropriate \u201csubvenient\nbase\u201d). Hence, we focus on the truth-maker objection.\n",
