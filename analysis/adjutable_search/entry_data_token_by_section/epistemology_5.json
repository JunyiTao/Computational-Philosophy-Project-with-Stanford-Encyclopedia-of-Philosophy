    "main_text": "The Varieties of Cognitive Success || Epistemic Harms and Epistemic Wrongs\n1.6 Epistemic Harms and Epistemic Wrongs\n\nObstructing an agent\u2019s cognitive success constitutes an\nepistemic harm. Wrongly obstructing an agent\u2019s cognitive success\nconstitutes an epistemic wrong. In a situation in which false\ntestimony would be an epistemic harm, dishonest testimony would be an\nepistemic wrong. But the range of epistemic harms and epistemic wrongs\ncan be much broader than those involving falsehood and deception.\nInsinuation, inattention, and indoctrination can all constitute\nepistemic harms or epistemic wrongs: each one can obstruct, and\nsometimes wrongly obstruct, an agent\u2019s cognitive success. For\ninstance, I can mislead you into drawing false conclusions, even if\nwhat I say is true: for instance, when I say \u201cthe victims were\nkilled by an immigrant\u201d, even if what I say is literally true,\nit can mislead my hearer into thinking that the killer\u2019s being\nan immigrant was in some way explanatorily relevant to her crime.\nAlternatively, I can harm you, and perhaps even wrong you, by getting\nyou to think poorly of your own capacity to grasp a subject by not\npaying attention to what you think or say. And finally, I can harm\nyou, and perhaps even wrong you, by indoctrinating you in a view so\nstrongly that you lose the ability to consider alternative views.\n\nThe epistemic harms and wrongs that we\u2019ve just mentioned occur\nfrequently in the course of daily life, and they are typically\nconstituted by some particular act that we perform (e.g., lending\ngreater credence to the word of a man over that of a woman, or using\nrhetorical devices to insinuate things that one doesn\u2019t know to\nbe true). But some of these harms and wrongs are constituted not by\nany particular act, but rather by the procedures that give rise to\nthose acts: for instance, when a research program in the life sciences\nimplicitly assumes an ideologically-driven conception of human nature\n(see Longino 1990 and Anderson 2004 for fascinating case studies). And\nsometimes, the harms and wrongs might even be built into our practice\nof epistemic appraisal\u2014perhaps even a tendency that is somehow\nconstitutive of that very practice. Suppose, for instance, that it is\nconstitutive of our practice of epistemic appraisal to count someone\nas knowing a fact only if they possess concepts adequate to\nconceptualize that fact. Whatever may be said in favor of our\npractice\u2019s having such a feature, one of its effects is clear:\nthose individuals who are cognitively most sensitive to facts for\nwhich adequate conceptual resources have not yet been devised (e.g.,\nsomeone living long before Freud who is sensitive to facts about\nrepression, or someone living in the nineteenth century who is\nsensitive to facts about sexual harassment) will find that the\ndeliverances of their unique cognitive sensitivities are not counted\nas knowledge. And so, these same individuals will not be granted the\nsame authority or credibility as other individuals, even when those\nlatter are less cognitively sensitive to the range of facts in\nquestion. Recent work in feminist epistemology has helped us to gain\nan appreciation of just how widespread this phenomenon is (see the\nseminal discussion of epistemic injustice in M. Fricker 2007, and the\ndevelopment of that account in Dotson 2014).\n",
