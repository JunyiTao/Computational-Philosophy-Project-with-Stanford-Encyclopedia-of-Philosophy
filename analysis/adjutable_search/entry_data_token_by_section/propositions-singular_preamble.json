    "main_text": "\n Singular propositions (also called \u2018\u2018Russellian\npropositions\u2019\u2019) are propositions that are about a\nparticular individual in virtue of having that individual as a direct\nconstituent. This characterization assumes a structured view of\npropositions \u2014\n  see propositions: structured.\nAlleged examples of singular propositions are the propositions [Mont\nBlanc is more than 4,000 meters high], [Socrates was wise], and [She\n(pointing at Susan) lives in New York]. A singular proposition is to\nbe contrasted with a general proposition, which is not about\nany particular individual, and a particularized proposition,\nwhich is about a particular individual but does not contain that\nindividual as a constituent. Examples of the first are the\npropositions [Most Americans favor tax cuts] and [Some music is\ngreat]; examples of the second are the propositions [The inventor of\nbifocals was bald] and [The tallest spy is a man]. A singular\nproposition is directly about an individual whereas a\nparticularized proposition is indirectly about an individual\nin virtue of that object satisfying a condition that is a constituent\nof the proposition \u2014 in our cases, the conditions\n\u2018x uniquely invented bifocals\u2019 and\n\u2018x is a tallest spy\u2019.\n\n\nThe acceptance or rejection of singular propositions lies at the\ncenter of many issues in semantics, the philosophy of language and\nmind, and metaphysics. In this essay, we shall look at some of the\narguments for singular propositions, discuss problems their existence\ngive rise to, and show how singular propositions are related to\ncertain questions in metaphysics.\n",
