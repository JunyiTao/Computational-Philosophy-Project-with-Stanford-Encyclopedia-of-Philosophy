    "main_text": "Requirements of Structural Rationality\n2. Requirements of Structural Rationality\n\nA common assumption in the literature on structural rationality is\nthat agents have the property of being structurally rational or\nirrational in virtue of satisfying or violating certain norms or\nrequirements of structural rationality (see esp. Broome 2013: Ch. 7).\nThis section is concerned with various disputes surrounding such\nstructural requirements. \u00a7\u00a72.1\u20132.4 address questions\nabout the general form of structural requirements, while \u00a72.5 is\nconcerned with skepticism about structural requirements and with\napproaches to structural rationality that dispense with structural\nrequirements. These disputes are important for anyone who aspires to\nspell out a theory of structural rationality. They are also \u2013 as\nwe\u2019ll see in \u00a73 \u2013 relevant for debates about the\nnormativity of rationality.\n",
