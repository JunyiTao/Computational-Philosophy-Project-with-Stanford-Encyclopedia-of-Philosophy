    "main_text": "The Science of Genetics || Medical Genetics\n1.4 Medical Genetics\n\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, as the science of genetics was just beginning\nto go molecular, a new batch of programs started showing up at medical\nschools with names like \u201cheredity clinic\u201d and\n\u201cmedical genetics\u201d. The faculty and staff at these units\neschewed direct reference to eugenics, but their methods and clinical\nadvice were quite similar. They advertised reproductive counseling in\nlocal newspapers. When couples showed up at the clinics, the\ngeneticists asked questions about what medical conditions ran in their\nfamily, and then the scientists constructed pedigrees to track the\nconditions. This facilitated hereditary risk assessments of what could\nbe transmitted to children born from that genetic union, and couples\nat risk of bearing a child with some disability were advised not to\nprocreate (Comfort 2012).\n\nWith the onset of the molecular revolution in biology in the 1950s and\n1960s, the suite of services that medical geneticists could offer\npatients expanded. Carrier screening became available, which allowed\nfor informing a patient that they carried a recessive allele of a\ndisease-causing gene and so may pass that trait onto a child even if\nthey did not show symptoms of the disease themselves. Amniocentesis\nwas also developed, which allowed for extracting fetal cells from the\namniotic sac, culturing those cells, and then testing for a range of\nmedical conditions in the fetus (Harper 2008).\n\nThe proliferation of genetic technologies in the mid-twentieth century\nbrought with it a demand for healthcare workers who could process that\ninformation and help patients understand it. The result was genetic\ncounseling programs. The professional emergence of genetic counseling\noccurred at the very same time that abortion was decriminalized in a\nnumber of countries, the disability rights movement and second-wave\nfeminism gained momentum, and bioethical attention to patient autonomy\nbecame a serious consideration in clinical care. This created a\nprofound tension for the young community of genetic counselors. On the\none hand, genetic counseling had a disciplinary ancestry that ran\ndirectly through heredity clinics and straightforward eugenics before\nthat; many of the genetic counselor\u2019s tools (e.g., constructing\na family pedigree) and many of the traits that received genetic\ncounseling attention (e.g., Down syndrome) were the very same tools\nand traits at the center of the earlier practices. On the other hand,\nthe genetic counselors\u2014mostly women\u2014were much more attuned\nthan the heredity clinic and medical genetics pioneers\u2014mostly\nmen\u2014to the moral and social problems with paternalistic medicine\nand eugenics highlighted by the critics from feminism, disability\nrights, and bioethics. The genetic counselors navigated this tension\nby embracing a principle of nondirectiveness; rather than telling\npatients how to act on the genetic information they received, genetic\ncounselors aspired to simply convey that genetic information in a\nnon-biased way and help the patients decide for themselves how to act\non that information (Stern 2012).\n\nThroughout the 1980s and 1990s, teams of researchers in the\never-expanding pool of medical genetics and human genetics programs\ncompeted to be the first to find the precise genomic location of\ndisease-causing genes. The challenge was to determine which\nchromosome, then which stretch of DNA, and finally which specific\nnucleic acid mutation was responsible for conditions like cystic\nfibrosis and breast cancer; the leaders of the teams that crossed the\nfinish line first became scientific celebrities. The excitement\nsurrounding the genetic discoveries was partly about the thrill of a\nscientific race; but more than that, it was also about the promise of\ngenetic tests that could tell patients more accurately whether or not\nthey were likely to develop some devastating disease and, beyond that,\nlead to the development of gene-based treatments or even cures for\nthose diseases.\n",
