They are contrasted\nwith more usual \u201csynthetic\u201d sentences, such as\n\u201cPediatricians are rich,\u201d (knowledge of) whose truth\ndepends also upon (knowledge of) the worldly fortunes of\npediatricians. Beginning with Frege, many philosophers hoped to show\nthat the truths of logic and mathematics and other apparently a\npriori domains, such as much of philosophy and the foundations of\nscience, could be shown to be analytic by careful \u201cconceptual\nanalysis\u201d of the meanings of crucial words.

The Intuitive Distinction\n\nCompare the following two sets of sentences:\n\nI.\n\n\n(1)\nAll doctors that specialize on children are rich.\n(2)\nAll pediatricians are rich.\n(3)\nEveryone who runs damages their bodies.\n(4)\nIf Holmes killed Sikes, then Watson must be dead.\n \n\n\nII.\n\n\n(5)\nAll doctors that specialize on children are doctors.\n(6)\nAll pediatricians are doctors.\n(7)\nEveryone who runs moves.\n(8)\nIf Holmes killed Sikes, then Sikes must be dead.\n \n\n\nMost competent English speakers who know the meanings of all the\nconstituent words would find an obvious difference between the two\nsets: whereas they might wonder about the truth or falsity of those of\nset I, they would find themselves pretty quickly incapable of doubting\nthose of II. Unlike the former, these latter seem to be justifiable\nautomatically, \u201cjust by knowing what the words mean,\u201d as\nmany might spontaneously put it. Indeed, denials of any of them,\ne.g.,\n\nIII.\n\n\n(9)\n#Not all pediatricians are doctors \u2013 some aren\u2019t\nat all!\n(10)\n#Not everyone who runs moves \u2013 some remain completely\nstill!\n \n\n\nwould seem to be in some important way unintelligible, very\nlike contradictions in terms (the \u201c#\u201d indicates semantic\nanomaly). Philosophers standardly refer to sentences of the first set\nas \u201csynthetic,\u201d those of the second as (at least\napparently) \u201canalytic.\u201d (Members of set III. are sometimes\nsaid to be \u201canalytically false,\u201d although this term is\nrarely used, and \u201canalytic\u201d is standardly confined to\nsentences that are regarded as true.) We might call sentences such as\n(5)-(10) part of the \u201canalytic data\u201d to which philosophers\nand linguists have often appealed in invoking the distinction (without\nprejudice, however, to whether such data might otherwise be\nexplained). Some philosophers might want to include in set III. what\nare called category mistakes (q.v.) such as #The number\nthree likes Tabasco sauce, or #Saturday is in bed (cf.,\nRyle, 1949 [2009]), but these have figured less prominently in recent\ndiscussions, being treated not as semantically anomalous, but as\nsimply false and silly (Quine 1960 [2013, p. 210]).\n\nMany philosophers have hoped that the apparent necessity and a\npriori status of the claims of logic, mathematics and much of\nphilosophy could be explained by their claims being analytic, our\nunderstanding of the meaning of the claims explaining why they seemed\nto be true \u201cin all possible worlds,\u201d and knowable to be\nso, \u201cindependently of experience.\u201d This view led many of\nthem to regard philosophy as consisting in large part in the\n\u201canalysis\u201d of the meanings of the relevant claims, words\nand\n concepts;[1]\n i.e., a provision of conditions that were individually necessary and\njointly sufficient for the application of a word or concept, in the\nway that, for example, being a female and being a\nparent are each necessary and together sufficient for being a\nmother. Such a conception seemed to invite and support (although\nwe\u2019ll see it doesn\u2019t entail) the special methodology of\n\u201carmchair reflection\u201d on concepts in which many\nphilosophers traditionally engaged, independently of any empirical\nresearch.\n1.1 Kant\n\nAlthough there are precursors of the contemporary notion of the\nanalytic in Leibniz, and in Locke and Hume in their talk of\n\u201crelations of ideas,\u201d the conception that currently\nconcerns many philosophers has its roots in the work of Kant (1787\n[1998]) who, at the beginning of his Critique of Pure Reason,\nwrote:\n\n\nIn all judgments in which the relation of a subject to the predicate\nis thought (if I only consider affirmative judgments, since the\napplication to negative ones is easy) this relation is possible in two\ndifferent ways. Either the predicate B belongs to the subject A as\nsomething that is (covertly) contained in this concept A; or B lies\nentirely outside the concept A, though to be sure it stands in\nconnection with it. In the first case, I call the judgment analytic,\nin the second synthetic. (1787 [1998], B10)\n\n\nHe provided as an example of an analytic judgment, \u201cAll bodies\nare extended\u201d: in thinking of a body we can\u2019t help but\nalso think of it being extended in space; that would seem to be just\npart of what is meant by \u201cbody.\u201d He contrasted this with\n\u201cAll bodies are heavy,\u201d where the predicate (\u201cis\nheavy\u201d) \u201cis something entirely different from that which I\nthink in the mere concept of body in general\u201d (B11), and we must\nput together, or \u201csynthesize,\u201d the different concepts,\nbody and heavy (sometimes such concepts are called\n\u201campliative,\u201d \u201camplifying\u201d a concept beyond\nwhat is \u201ccontained\u201d in it).\n\nKant tried to spell out his \u201ccontainment\u201d metaphor for the\nanalytic in two ways. To see that any of set II is true, he wrote,\n\u201cI need only to analyze the concept, i.e., become conscious of\nthe manifold that I always think in it, in order to encounter this\npredicate therein\u201d (B10). But then, picking up a suggestion of\nLeibniz, he went on to claim:\n\n\nI merely draw out the predicate in accordance with the principle of\ncontradiction, and can thereby at the same time become conscious of\nthe necessity of the judgment. (B11)\n\n\nAs Jerrold Katz (1988) emphasized, this second definition is\nsignificantly different from the \u201ccontainment\u201d idea, since\nnow, in its appeal to the powerful method of proof by contradiction,\nthe analytic would include all of the (potentially infinite) deductive\nconsequences of a particular claim, many of which could not be\nplausibly regarded as \u201ccontained\u201d in the concept expressed\nin the claim. For starters, Bachelors are unmarried or the moon is\nblue is a logical consequence of Bachelors are\nunmarried\u2014its denial contradicts the latter (a denial of a\ndisjunction is a denial of each disjunct)\u2014but clearly nothing\nabout the color of the moon is remotely \u201ccontained in\u201d the\nconcept bachelor. To avoid such consequences, Katz (e.g.,\n1972, 1988) went on to try to develop a serious theory based upon only\nthe initial containment idea, as, along different lines, does Paul\nPietroski (2005, 2018).\n\nOne reason Kant may not have noticed the differences between his\ndifferent characterizations of the analytic was that his conception of\n\u201clogic\u201d seems to have been confined to Aristotelian\nsyllogistic, and so didn\u2019t include the full resources of modern\nlogic, where, as we\u2019ll see, the differences between the two\ncharacterizations become more glaring (see MacFarlane 2002). Indeed,\nKant demarcates the category of the analytic chiefly in order to\ncontrast it with what he regards as the more important category of the\n\u201csynthetic,\u201d which he famously thinks is not confined, as\none might initially suppose, merely to the\n empirical.[2]\n He argues that even so elementary an example in arithmetic as\n7+5=12 is synthetic, since the concept of 12 is not\ncontained in the concepts of 7, 5, or +,:\nappreciating the truth of the proposition would seem to require some\nkind of active \u201csynthesis\u201d by the mind uniting the\ndifferent constituent thoughts (1787 [1998], B15). And so we arrive at\nthe category of the \u201csynthetic a priori,\u201d whose\nvery possibility became a major concern of his work. Kant tried to\nshow that the activity of synthesis was the source of the important\ncases of a priori knowledge, not only in arithmetic, but also\nin geometry, the foundations of physics, ethics, and philosophy\ngenerally, a controversial view that set the stage for much of the\nphilosophical discussions of the subsequent centuries (see Coffa 1991,\npt. I).\n\nApart from geometry, Kant, himself, actually didn\u2019t focus much\non the case of mathematics. But, as mathematics in the 19th C. began\nreaching new heights of sophistication, worries were increasingly\nraised about its foundations. It was specifically in response to these\nlatter worries that Gottlob Frege (1884 [1980]) tried to improve upon\nKant\u2019s formulations of the analytic, and presented what is\nwidely regarded as the next significant discussion of the\n topic.[3]\n1.2 Frege\n\nFrege (1884 [1980], \u00a7\u00a75,88) and others noted a number of\nproblems with Kant\u2019s \u201ccontainment\u201d metaphor. In the\nfirst place, as Kant (1787 [1998], B756) himself would surely have\nagreed, the criterion would need to be freed of\n\u201cpsychologistic\u201d suggestions, or claims about merely the\naccidental thought processes of thinkers, as opposed to claims about\ntruth and justification that are presumably at issue with the\nanalytic. In particular, mere associations are not always matters of\nmeaning: many people in thinking about Columbus may automatically\nthink \u201cthe discoverer of America,\u201d or in thinking about\nthe number 7 they \u201ccan\u2019t help but also think\u201d about\nthe numeral that denotes it, but it\u2019s certainly not analytic\nthat Columbus discovered America, or that a number is identical with a\nnumeral. Moreover, while it may be arguably analytic that a circle is\na closed figure of constant curvature (see Katz, 1972), someone could\nfail to notice this and so think the one without the other.\n\nEven were Kant to have solved this problem, it isn\u2019t clear how\nhis notion of \u201ccontainment\u201d would cover cases that seem to\nbe as \u201canalytic\u201d as any of set II, such as:\n\nIV.\n\n\n(11)\nAnyone who\u2019s an ancestor of an ancestor of Bob is an\nancestor of Bob.\n(12)\nIf Bob is married to Sue, then Sue is married to\nBob.\n(13)\nIf something is red, then it\u2019s colored.\n \n\n\nThe transitivity of ancestor or the symmetry of\nmarried are not obviously \u201ccontained in\u201d the\ncorresponding thoughts in the way that the idea of extension\nis plausibly \u201ccontained in\u201d the notion of body,\nor male in the notion of bachelor. (13) has seemed\nparticularly troublesome: what else besides colored could be\nincluded in the analysis? The concept red involves color\n\u2013 and what else? It is hard to see what else to\n\u201cadd\u201d \u2013 except red itself!\n\nFrege attempted to remedy the situation by completely rethinking the\nfoundations of logic, developing what we now think of as modern\nsymbolic logic. He defined a perfectly precise \u201cformal\u201d\nlanguage, i.e., a language characterized by the \u201cform\u201d\n\u2013 standardly, the shape\u2014of its expressions, and he\ncarefully set out an account of the syntax and semantics of what are\ncalled the \u201clogical constants,\u201d such as \u201cand,\u201d\n\u201cor,\u201d \u201cnot,\u201d \u201call\u201d and\n\u201csome,\u201d showing how to capture a very wide class of valid\ninferences containing them. Saying precisely how the constants are\ndetermined is a matter of controversy (see Logical\nConstants), but, at least roughly and intuitively, they can be\nthought of as those parts of language that don\u2019t\n\u201cpoint\u201d or \u201cfunction referentially,\u201d aiming to\nrefer to something in the world, in the way that ordinary nouns,\nverbs, adjectives, adverbs and prepositions seem to do.\n\u201cSocrates\u201d refers to Socrates, \u201cdogs\u201d to dogs,\n\u201c(is) clever\u201d to cleverness and/or clever things, but\nwords like \u201cor\u201d and \u201call\u201d don\u2019t seem to\nfunction referentially at all. At any rate, it certainly isn\u2019t\nclear that there are any ors and alls in the world,\nalong with Socrates, the dogs, and sets or properties of them.\n\nThis distinction between non-logical, \u201creferring\u201d\nexpressions and logical constants allows us to define a logical truth\nin a way that has become common (and will be particularly useful in\nthis entry) as a sentence that is true no matter what non-logical\nexpressions occur in it (cf. Tarski, 1936 [1983], Quine, 1956\n[1976], Davidson 1980). Consequently (placing non-logical expressions\nin bold, and re-numbering prior examples):\n\n(14)\nAll doctors that specialize on\nchildren are doctors.\n\n\ncounts as a (strict) logical truth: no matter what grammatical\nexpressions we put in for the non-logical terms \u201cdoctor\u201d,\n\u201cspecialize on\u201d and \u201cchildren\u201d in (14), the\nsentence will remain true. For example, substituting\n\u201ccats\u201d for \u201cdoctors\u201d, \u201cchase\u201d for\n\u201cspecialize on\u201d and \u201cmice\u201d for\n\u201cchildren,\u201d we get:\n\n(15)\nAll cats that chase mice are cats.\n\n\n(Throughout this discussion, by \u201csubstitution\u201d we shall\nmean uniform substitution of one presumably univocal expression for\nanother in all its occurrences in a sentence.) But what about the\nothers of set II? Substituting \u201ccats\u201d for\n\u201cdoctors\u201d and \u201cmice\u201d for\n\u201cpediatricians\u201d in\n\n(16)\nAll pediatricians are doctors.\n\n\nwe get:\n\n(17)\nAll mice are cats.\n\n\nwhich is obviously false, as would many such substitutions render the\nrest of the examples of II. (14) and (15) are patent logical truths;\ntheir truth depends only upon the semantic values of their logical\nparticles. But All pediatricians are doctors and the other\nexamples, (6)\u2013(8) and (11)\u2013(13), are not formal\nlogical truths, specifiable by the logical form of the\nsentence (or its pattern of logical particles) alone; nor are their\ndenials, e.g., (9) and (10), formal contradictions (i.e., of\nthe form, where \u2018p\u2019 stands in for any\nsentence: \u201cp and it is not the case that\np\u201d). How are we to capture them?\n\nHere Frege appealed to the notion of \u201cdefinition,\u201d or\n\u2014presuming that definitions preserve\n\u201cmeaning\u201d\u2014 \u201csynonymy\u201d: the non-logical\nanalytic truths are those that can be converted to formal logical\ntruths by substitution of definitions for defined terms, or synonyms\nfor synonyms. Since \u201cmice\u201d is not synonymous with\n\u201cpediatrician,\u201d (17) is not a substitution into (16) of\nthe required sort. We need, instead, a substitution of the\ndefinition of \u201cpediatrician,\u201d i.e., \u201cdoctor\nthat specializes on children,\u201d which would convert (16) into our\nearlier purely formal logical truth:\n\n(14)\nAll doctors that specialize on children are doctors.\n\n\nOf course, these notions of definition, meaning and\nsynonymy would themselves need to be clarified, But they were\nthought at the time to be sufficiently obvious notions whose\nclarification didn\u2019t seem particularly urgent until W.V.O. Quine\n(1953 [1980a]) raised serious questions about them much later (see\n\u00a73.3ff below). Putting those questions to one side, Frege made\nspectacularly interesting suggestions, offering a famous definition,\nfor example, of the \u201cancestral\u201d relation involved in (11)\nas a basis for his definition of number (see\nFrege\u2019s Theorem and Foundations for Arithmetic), and\ninspiring the program of \u201clogicism\u201d (or the reduction of\narithmetic to logic) that was pursued in Whitehead and Russell\u2019s\n(1910\u201313) monumental Principia Mathematica, and the\n(early) Ludwig Wittgenstein\u2019s (1922) Tractatus\nLogico-philosophicus.\n\nFrege was mostly interested in formalizing arithmetic, and so\nconsidered the logical forms of a relative minority of natural\nlanguage sentences in a deliberately spare notation \u2013 he\ndidn\u2019t take on the likes of (12)-(13). But work on the logical\n(or syntactic) structure of the full range of sentences of natural\nlanguage has blossomed since then, initially in the work of Bertrand\nRussell (1905), in his famous theory of definite descriptions (see\nDescriptions), which he (1912) combined with his views about\nthe knowledge by \u201cacquaintance\u201d with sense-data and\nuniversals into a striking \u201cfundamental principle in the\nanalysis of propositions containing descriptions\u201d:\n\n\nEvery proposition which we can understand must be composed wholly of\nconstituents with which we are acquainted (1912:58),\n\n\nan early version of a proposal pursued by Logical Positivists, to be\ndiscussed in the next sections below. Frege\u2019s and\nRussell\u2019s formalizations are also indirectly the inspiration for\nthe subsequent work of Noam Chomsky and other \u201cgenerative\u201d\nlinguists and logicians (see supplement). Whether\nFrege\u2019s criterion of analyticity will work for the rest of II\nand other analyticities depends upon the details of these latter\nproposals, some of which are discussed in the supplement,\n2. High Hopes\n\nInfluenced by these developments in logic, many philosophers in the\nfirst half of the Twentieth Century thought analyticity could perform\ncrucial epistemological work not only in accounting for our apparently\na priori knowledge of mathematics, but also \u2014with a\nlittle help from British empiricism\u2014of our understanding of\nclaims about the spatiotemporal world as well. Indeed,\n\u201canalysis\u201d and the \u201clinguistic turn\u201d (Rorty,\n1992) soon came to constitute the very way many Anglophone\nphilosophers characterized their work, particularly since such\nanalyses of what we mean by our words seemed to be the sort of\nenterprise available to \u201carmchair reflection\u201d that seemed\nto many a distinctive feature of that work (see Haug, 2014). Many\nthought this project would also perform the more metaphysical\nwork of explaining the truth and necessity of\nmathematics, showing not only how it is we could know about\nthese topics independently of experience, but how they could be\ntrue in this and in all possible worlds, usually, though,\nwithout distinguishing this project from the epistemic one. Thus,\nGilbert Harman (1967 [1999] begins his review of the topic combining\nthe two projects:\n\n\nWhat I shall call a \u2018full-blooded theory of analytic\ntruth\u2019 takes the analytic truths to be those that hold solely by\nvirtue of meaning or that are knowable solely by virtue of meaning.\n(p. 119, see also p. 127),\n\n\ntaking himself to be expressing the views of a number of other then\ncontemporary philosophers.\n\nThis seemed like a grand unified plan until Saul Kripke (1972) and\nHilary Putnam (1975) drew attention to fundamental differences between\nthe metaphysical and epistemic modalities that had tended to be run\ntogether throughout this period. They pointed out that, for example,\n\u201cwater is H2O\u201d might well be necessarily true,\nbut not knowable a priori, and \u201cThe meter stick in\nParis is one meter long\u201d might be knowable a priori but\nnot be necessarily true (that very stick might have been broken and\nnever used for measurements; see A Priori Justification and\nKnowledge).\n\nOnce the metaphysical and epistemic issues are separated, it becomes\nless obvious that mere matters of meaning could really explain all\nnecessities. Recall that Frege\u2019s ambition had been to\nreduce mathematics to logic by showing how, substituting synonyms for\nsynonyms, every mathematical truth could be shown to be a logical one.\nHe hadn\u2019t gone on to claim that the logical truths\nthemselves were true or necessary by virtue of meaning alone.\nThese were \u201cLaws of Truth\u201d (Frege, 1918/84:58), and it\nwasn\u2019t clear what sort of explanation could be provided for\nthem. Obviously, appealing merely to further synonym substitutions\nwouldn\u2019t suffice. As Michael Devitt (1993a) pointed out:\n\n\nthe sentence \u2018All bachelors are unmarried\u2019 is not true\nsolely in virtue of meaning and so is not analytic in the\u2026sense\n[of true in virtue of meaning alone]. The sentence is indeed true\npartly in virtue of the fact that \u2018unmarried\u2019 must refer\nto anything that \u2018bachelor\u2019 refers to but it is also true\npartly in virtue of the truth of \u2018All unmarrieds are\nunmarried.\u2019 (Devitt 1993a, p. 287; cf., Quine 1956 [1976], p.\n118)\n\n\nIt was certainly not clear that the truth of \u201cAll unmarrieds are\nunmarrieds\u201d is based on the same sort of arbitrary synonymy\nfacts that underlie \u201cAll bachelors are unmarried.\u201d In any\nevent, a different kind of account seemed to be needed (see\n footnotes 9 and 16).\n\nJerrold Katz and Paul Postal (1991, pp. 516\u20137) did claim that\nadequate linguistic theory should, inter alia, explain why,\nif John killed Bill is true, then so is Bill is\ndead. However, as David Israel (1991) pointed out in reply:\n\u201cthere are facts about English, about what propositions are\nexpressed by certain utterances, and then there is a non-linguistic\nfact: that one proposition entails another\u201d (p. 571). Utterances\nof sentences are one thing; the propositions (or\nthoughts) many different sentences may express,\nquite another, and the two shouldn\u2019t be confused:\n\n\nIt is just not true that if the proposition expressed by [an\nutterance of John killed Bill] is true that, then \u201cin\nvirtue of [natural language] so, necessarily, is\u201d the\nproposition expressed by [an utterance of Bill is\ndead]. Rather, if the proposition that, according to the grammar\nof English, is expressed by [an utterance of John killed\nBill] is true, then, in virtue of the structure of the\npropositions concerned, the proposition that,\naccording to the grammar of English, is expressed by [an utterance of\nBill is dead] must also be true.--(D. Israel, 1991, p. 71,\nemphasis added)\n\n\nProviding the metaphysical basis for logical truth is a fine issue\n(see Logical Truth), but as Devitt (1993a and b) and others\n(e.g., Paul Boghossian, 1996, Williamson, 2007) went on to stress, it\nhas been the epistemological issues about justifying our\nbeliefs in necessary truths that have dominated philosophical\ndiscussions of the analytic in the last seventy\n years.[4]\n Consequently, we will focus primarily on this more modest,\nepistemological project in the remainder of this entry.\n2.1 Mathematics\n\nAs we noted (\u00a71.2), Frege had developed formal logic to account\nfor our apparently a priori knowledge of mathematics. It is\nworth dwelling on the interest of this problem. It is arguably one of\nthe oldest and hardest problems in Western philosophy, and is easy\nenough to understand: ordinarily we acquire knowledge about the world\nby using our senses. If we are interested, for example, in whether\nit\u2019s raining outside, how many birds are on the beach, whether\nfish sleep or stars collapse, we look and see, or turn to others who\ndo. It is a widespread view that Western sciences owe their tremendous\nsuccesses precisely to relying on just such \u201cempirical\u201d\n(experiential, experimental) methods. However, it is also a patent\nfact about all these sciences, and even our ordinary ways of counting\nbirds, fish and stars, that they depend on often immensely\nsophisticated mathematics, and mathematics does not seem to be known\non the basis of experience. Mathematicians don\u2019t do experiments\nin the way that chemists, biologists or other \u201cnatural\nscientists\u201d do. They seem simply to think, seeming to\nrely precisely on the kind of \u201carmchair reflection\u201d to\nwhich many philosophers also aspire. In any case, they don\u2019t try\nto justify their claims by reference to experiments, arguing that\ntwice two is four by noting that pairs of pairs tend in all cases\nobserved so far to be quadruples.\n\nBut how could mere processes of thought issue in any knowledge about\nthe independently existing external world? The belief that it could\nwould seem to involve some kind of mysticism; and, indeed, many\n\u201cnaturalistic\u201d philosophers have felt that the appeals of\n\u201cRationalist\u201d philosophers to some special faculty of\n\u201crational intuition,\u201d such as one finds in philosophers\nlike Plato, Descartes and Leibniz and, more recently, Katz (1988,\n1990), George Bealer (1987) and Laurence Bonjour (1998), these all\nseem no better off than appeals to \u201crevelation\u201d to\nestablish theology. The program of logicism and \u201canalysis\u201d\nseemed to many to offer a more promising, \u201cnaturalistic\u201d\nalternative.\n2.2 Science and Beyond\n\nBut why stop at arithmetic? If logical analysis could illuminate the\nfoundations of mathematics by showing how the axioms of arithmetic\ncould all be derived from pure logic by substitution of synonyms,\nperhaps it could also illuminate the foundations of the rest of our\nknowledge by showing how its claims could similarly be derived from\nsome kind of combination of logic and experience. Such was the hope\nand program of Logical Positivism (see Logical Empiricism)\nchampioned by, e.g., Moritz Schlick, A.J. Ayer and, especially, Rudolf\nCarnap from about 1915 in Vienna and Berlin to well into the 1950s in\nEngland and America. Of course, such a proposal did presume that all\nof our concepts were somehow \u201cderived\u201d either from logic\nor experience, but this seemed in keeping with the then prevailing\npresumptions of empiricism, which, they assumed, had been vindicated\nby the immense success of the empirical sciences.\n\nFor the Positivists, earlier empiricists, such as Locke, Berkeley and\nHume, had erred only in thinking that the mechanism of construction\nwas mere association. But association can\u2019t account for the\nstructure of even a simple judgment, such as Caesar is bald.\nThis is not merely the excitation of its constituent ideas,\nCaesar, is, and bald, along the lines of\nthe idea of salt exciting the idea of pepper, but,\nas Frege had shown, involves combining the noun Caesar and\nthe predicate is bald in a very particular way, a fact that\nwas important in accounting for more complex judgments such as\nCaesar is bald or not bald, or Someone is bald. Our\nthoughts and claims about the world have some kind of logical\nstructure, of a sort that seems to begin to be revealed by\nFrege\u2019s proposals. Equipped with his logic, it was possible to\nprovide a more plausible formulation of conceptual empiricism: our\nclaims about the empirical world were to be analyzed into the\n(dis)confirming experiences out of which they must somehow have been\nlogically constructed.\n\nBut constructed out of which experiences? For the\nPositivists, the answer seemed obvious: out of the experiential\ntests that would standardly justify, verify\nor confirm the claim. Indeed, as Ayer (1934, chap 1) made\nplain, a significant motivation for the Positivists was to save\nempirical knowledge from the predations of traditional sceptical\narguments about the possibility that all of life is a dream or the\ndeception of an evil demon: if meaning could be tied to verification,\nsuch possibilities could be rendered \u201cmeaningless\u201d because\nunverifiable (see Jerry Fodor, 2001, pp. 3\u20135, for a penetrating\ndiscussion of this motivation). In any event, interpreting\nWittgenstein\u2019s (1922) Tractatus claims about the nature\nof language epistemologically along the lines of the American\nphilosopher, C.S. Peirce, they proposed various versions of their\n\u201cVerifiability Theory of Meaning,\u201d according to which the\nmeaning (or what they called the \u201ccognitive significance\u201d)\nof any sentence was constituted by the conditions of its\nempirical\n (dis-)confirmation.[5]\n Thus, to say that the temperature of a liquid is of a certain\nmagnitude is to say, for example, that the mercury in a thermometer\nimmersed in the liquid would expand to a certain point marked by a\nnumeral representing that magnitude, a claim that would ordinarily be\ndisconfirmed if it didn\u2019t. Closer to \u201cexperience\u201d:\nto say that there is a cat on a mat is just to say that certain\npatterns of certain familiar visual, tactile and aural appearances are\nto be expected under certain circumstances.\n\nThe project of providing analyses in this way of especially\nproblematic concepts like those concerning, for example, material\nobjects, knowledge, perception, causation, expectation, freedom,\nand the self, was pursued by Positivists and other analytic\nphilosophers for a considerable period (see Carnap 1928 [1967] for\nsome rigorous examples, Ayer 1934 [1952] for more accessible ones).\nWith regard to material object claims, the program came to be known as\n\u201cphenomenalism\u201d; with regard to the theoretical claims of\nscience, as \u201coperationalism\u201d ; and with regard to the\nclaims about people\u2019s mental lives, \u201canalytical\nbehaviorism\u201d (the relevant experiential basis of mental claims\nbeing taken to be observations of others\u2019 behavior). Although\nthese programs became extremely influential, and some form of the\nverifiability criterion was often (and sometimes still is) invoked in\nphysics and psychology to constrain theoretical speculation, they\nseldom, if ever, met with any serious success. No sooner was an\nanalysis, say, of \u201cmaterial object\u201d or\n\u201cfreedom\u201d or \u201cexpectation,\u201d proposed than\nserious counterexamples were raised and the analysis revised, only to\nbe faced with still further counterexamples (see Roderick Chisholm\n1957, and Fodor 1981, for discussion). Despite what seemed its initial\nplausibility, philosophers came to suspect that the criterion, and\nwith it the very notion of analyticity itself, rested on some\nfundamental mistakes.\n3. Problems with the Distinction\n3.1 The Paradox of Analysis\n\nOne problem with the entire program was raised by C.H. Langford (1942)\nand discussed by G.E. Moore (1942 [1968], pp. 665\u20136): why should\nanalyses be of any conceivable interest? After all, if an analysis\nconsists in providing the definition of an expression, then it should\nbe providing a synonym for it, and this, then, should be wholly\nuninformative: if brother is analyzed as the presumably\nsynonymous male sibling, then the claim Brothers are male\nsiblings should be synonymous with Brothers are\nbrothers, and thinking the one should be no different from\nthinking the other. But, aside from such simple cases as\nbrother and bachelor, proposed analyses, if\nsuccessful, often seemed quite non-obvious and philosophically\ninformative. The proposed reductions of, say, material object\nstatements to sensory ones (even where successful) were often fairly\ncomplex, had to be studied and learned, and so could hardly be\nuninformative. So how could they count as seriously\n analytic?[6]\n\nThis is \u201cthe paradox of analysis,\u201d which can be seen as\ndormant in Frege\u2019s own move from his (1884) focus on definitions\nto his more controversial (1892a) doctrine of \u201csense,\u201d\nwhere two senses are distinct if and only if someone can think a\nthought containing the one but not other, as in the case of the senses\nof \u201cthe morning star\u201d and \u201cthe evening star.\u201d\nIf analyses or definitions preserved sense, then, unlike the case of\n\u201cmorning star\u201d and \u201cevening star,\u201d whenever\none thought the definiendum, one should thereby be thinking the\ndefiniens. And perhaps one can\u2019t think Bill is Bob\u2019s\nbrother without thinking Bill is Bob\u2019s male sibling. But few of\nFrege\u2019s definitions of arithmetic concepts are nearly so simple\n(see Gottlob Frege, \u00a72.5). In their case, it seems\nperfectly possible to think the definiendum, say, number,\nwithout thinking the elaborate definiens Frege provided (cf. Bealer\n1982, Michael Dummett 1991, and John Horty 1993, 2007, for extensive\ndiscussions of this problem, as well as of further conditions, e.g.,\nfecundity, that Frege placed on serious definitions).\n\nThese problems, so far, can be regarded as relatively technical, for\nwhich further technical moves within the program might be made. For\nexample, one might make further distinctions within the theory of\nsense between an expression\u2019s \u201ccontent\u201d and the\nspecific \u201clinguistic vehicle\u201d used for its expression, as\nin Fodor (1990a) and Horty (1993, 2007); and perhaps distinguish\nbetween the truth-conditional \u201ccontent\u201d of an expression\nand its idiosyncratic role, or \u201ccharacter,\u201d in a language\nsystem, along the lines of the distinction David Kaplan (1989)\nintroduced to deal with indexical and demonstrative expressions (such\nas I, now, and that; see\nDemonstratives, and Narrow Mental Content, as well\nas Stephen White, 1982). Perhaps analyses could be regarded as\nproviding a particular \u201cvehicle,\u201d having a specific\n\u201ccharacter,\u201d that could account for why one could\nentertain a certain concept without entertaining its analysis (cf.\nGillian Russell 2008, and Paul Pietroski 2002, 2005 and 2018 for\nrelated suggestions).\n\nHowever, the problems with the program seemed to many philosophers to\nbe deeper than merely technical. By far, the most telling and\ninfluential of the criticisms both of the program, and then of\nanalyticity in general, were those of Quine, who began as a great\nchampion of the program (see esp. his 1934), and whose subsequent\nobjections therefore carry special weight. The reader is well-advised\nto consult particularly his (1956 [1976], hereafter \u201cCLT\u201d)\nfor as rich and deep a discussion of the issues up to that time as one\nmight find. The next two sections abbreviate some of that\ndiscussion.\n3.2 Problems with Logicism\n\nAlthough pursuit of the logicist program produced a great many\ninsights into the nature of mathematics, there emerged a number of\nserious difficulties with it. Right from the start there was, of\ncourse, the problem of the logical truths themselves. Simply saying,\nas Frege had, that they are \u201cLaws of Truth\u201d doesn\u2019t\nseem to explain how we could know them a priori. But perhaps\nthey, too, are \u201canalytic\u201d involving perhaps some sort of\n\u201cimplicit\u201d acceptance of certain rules merely by virtue of\naccepting certain patterns of reasoning. But any such proposal has to\naccount for people\u2019s frequent, often apparent violations of\nrules of logic in fallacious reasoning and in ordinary speech, as well\nas of disputes about the laws of logic of the sort that are raised,\nfor example, by mathematical intuitionists, who deny the Law of\nExcluded Middle (\u201cp or not p\u201d), or, more recently, by\n\u201cpara-consistent\u201d logicians, who argue for the toleration\neven of contradictions to avoid certain\n paradoxes.[7]\n Moreover, given that the infinitude of logical truths needs to be\n\u201cgenerated\u201d by rules of inference, wouldn\u2019t that be\na reason for regarding them as \u201csynthetic\u201d in Kant\u2019s\nsense (see Frege 1884 [1980], \u00a788, Katz 1988, pp. 58\u20139, and\nMacFarlane 2002)?\n\nMuch more worrisome is a challenge raised by Quine (CLT, \u00a7II):\neven if certain logical truths seemed undeniable, how does claiming\nthem to be analytic differ from claiming them to be simply\n \u201cobvious\u201d?[8]\n\n\nConsider\u2026the logical truth \u201cEverything is\nself-identical\u201d, \u201c(x)(x = x)\u201d. We can say that it\ndepends for its truth on traits of the language (specifically on the\nusage of \u201c=\u201d), and not on traits of its subject matter;\nbut we can also say, alternatively, that it depends on an obvious\ntrait, viz., self-identity, of its subject matter, viz., everything.\nThe tendency of [my] present reflections is that there is no\ndifference. (CLT, p. 113)\n\n\nPressing the point more deeply:\n\n\nI have been using the vaguely psychological word \u201cobvious\u201d\nnon-technically, assigning it no explanatory value. My suggestion is\nmerely that the linguistic doctrine of elementary logical truth\nlikewise leaves explanation unbegun. I do not suggest that the\nlinguistic doctrine is false and some doctrine of ultimate and\ninexplicable insight into the obvious trait of reality is true, but\nonly that there is no real difference between these two\npseudo-doctrines. (CLT, p. 113)\n\n\nAs we\u2019ll see, this is the seed for the challenge that continues\nto haunt proposals about the analytic to this day: what explanatory\ndifference is there between \u201canalytic\u201d claims and simply\nwidely and firmly held beliefs, such as that The earth has existed\nfor many years or There have been black dogs?\nWe\u2019ll consider some proposals \u2014and their problems\u2014\nin due course, but it\u2019s important to bear in mind that, if no\ndifference can be sustained, then it\u2019s difficult to see the\nsignificance of the logicist program or of the claims of (strictly)\n\u201canalytic\u201d philosophy generally.\n\nThe most immediately calamitous challenge to Logicism was, however,\nthe famous paradox Russell raised for one of Frege\u2019s crucial\naxioms, his prima facie plausible \u201cBasic Law V\u201d\n(sometimes called \u201cthe unrestricted Comprehension Axiom\u201d),\nwhich had committed him to the existence of a set for every predicate.\nBut what, asked Russell, of the predicate x is not a member of\nitself? If there were a set for that predicate, that set itself\nwould be a member of itself if and only if it wasn\u2019t;\nconsequently, there could be no such set. Therefore Frege\u2019s\nBasic Law V couldn\u2019t be true (but see Frege\u2019s Theorem\nand Foundations for Arithmetic for ways to rescue something close\nto logicism, discussed in \u00a75 below).\n\nWhat was especially upsetting about Russell\u2019s paradox was that\nthere seemed to be no intuitively satisfactory way to repair set\ntheory in a way that could lay claim to being as obvious and/or merely\na matter of logic or meaning in the way that Frege and the Positivists\nhad hoped. Various proposals were made, but all of them seemed simply\ntailor-made to avoid the paradox, and seemed to have little\nindependent appeal (although see Boolos, 1971, for a defense of the\n\u201citerative\u201d notion of set). Certainly none of them\nappeared to be analytic. Indeed, as Quine notes:\n\n\nWhat we do [in set theory] is develop one or another set theory by\nobvious reasoning, or elementary logic, from unobvious first\nprinciples which are set down, whether for good or for the time being,\nby something like convention. (CLT, p. 111)\n\n3.3 Convention?\n\nConvention, indeed, would seem to be at the very heart of the\nanalytic. After all, aren\u2019t matters of meaning, unlike matters\nof fact, in the end really matters of arbitrary conventions about the\nuse of words? For example, someone could invest a particular word,\nsay, \u201cschmuncle,\u201d with a specific meaning merely by\nstipulating that it mean, say, unmarried uncle. Wouldn\u2019t that\nafford a basis for claiming then that \u201cA schmuncle is an\nuncle\u201d is analytic, or knowable to be true by virtue of the\n(stipulated) meanings of the words alone?\n\nCarnap (1956a) proposed setting out the \u201cmeaning\npostulates\u201d of a scientific language as just such conventional\nstipulations. This had the further advantage of allowing terms to be\n\u201cimplicitly defined\u201d by their conventional roles in such\npostulates, which might then serve as part of a theory\u2019s laws or\naxioms. The strategy seemed especially appropriate for defining\nlogical constants, as well as for dealing with cases like (11)-(13)\nabove, e.g. \u201cRed is a color,\u201d where mere substitution of\nsynonyms might not\n suffice.[9]\n So perhaps what philosophical analysis is doing is revealing the\ntacit conventions of ordinary language, an approach particularly\nfavored by Ayer (1934/52).\n\nQuine is sceptical such a strategy could work for the principles of\nlogic itself. Drawing on his earlier discussion (1936 [1976]) of the\nconventionality of logic, he argues that logic itself could not be\nentirely established by such conventions, since:\n\n\nthe logical truths, being infinite in number, must be given by general\nconventions rather than singly; and logic is needed then in the\nmeta-theory, in order to apply the general conventions to individual\ncases (CLT, p. 115)\n\n\nIf so, and if logic is established by convention, then one would need\na meta-meta-theory to establish the conventions for the use\nof the logical particles of the meta-theory, and so on for what seemed\nlike an infinite regress of meta-theories. This is certainly an\nargument that ought to give the proponents of the conventionality of\nlogic pause: for, indeed, how could one hope to set out the general\nconventions for \u201call\u201d or\n\u201cif\u2026then\u2026\u201d without at some point using the\nnotions of \u201call\u201d and \u201cif\u2026then\u2026\u201d\n(\u201cALL instances of a universal quantification are to be\ntrue\u201d. \u201cIF p is one premise, and if p then\nq another, THEN conclude q\u201d)? (See Warren, 2017,\nhowever, for a reply, exploiting the resources of implicit definition;\ncf. fns 9 and 16.)\n\nAs we noted, Quine sees more room for convention in choosing between\ndifferent, incompatible versions of set theory needed for mathematics\nthat were developed in the wake of Russell\u2019s paradox. Here:\n\n\nWe find ourselves making deliberate choices and setting them forth\nunaccompanied by any attempt at justification other than in terms of\nelegance and convenience. (CLT, p. 117).\n\n\nBut then it\u2019s hard to see the difference between mathematics and\nthe conventional \u201cmeaning postulates\u201d Carnap had proposed\nfor establishing the rest of science \u2014and then the difference\nbetween them and any other claims of a theory. As Quine goes on to\nargue, although stipulative definitions (what he calls\n\u201clegislative postulations\u201d)\n\n\ncontribute truths which become integral to the corpus of truths, the\nartificiality of their origin does not linger as a localized quality,\nbut suffuses the corpus. If a subsequent expositor singles out those\nonce legislatively postulated truths again as postulates, this\nsignifies nothing\u2026 He could as well choose his postulates from\nelsewhere in the corpus, and will if he thinks it this serves his\nexpository ends. (CLT, pp. 119\u201320)\n\n\nCarnap\u2019s legislated \u201cmeaning postulates\u201d should\ntherefore be regarded as just an arbitrary selection of sentences a\ntheory presents as true, a selection perhaps useful for purposes of\nexposition, but no more significant than the selection of certain\ntowns in Ohio as \u201cstarting points\u201d for a journey Quine\n(1953 [1980a], p. 35).\n\nQuine\u2019s observation certainly seems to accord with scientific\npractice. Suppose, say, Newton, himself, had explicitly set out\n\u201cF=ma\u201d as a stipulated definition of \u201cF\u201d:\nwould \u201cF=ma\u201d be therefore justifiable by knowing the\nmeaning the words alone? Our taking such a stipulation seriously would\nseem to depend upon our view of the plausibility of the surrounding\ntheory as a whole. After all, as Quine continues:\n\n\n[S]urely the justification of any theoretical hypothesis can, at the\ntime of hypothesis, consist in no more than the elegance and\nconvenience which the hypothesis brings to the containing bodies of\nlaws and data. How then are we to delimit the category of legislative\npostulation, short of including under it every new act of scientific\nhypothesis? (CLT, p. 121)\n\n\nSo conventional legislation of claims, such as Carnap\u2019s meaning\npostulates, affords the claims no special status. As vivid examples,\nPutnam (1965 [1975]) discusses in detail revisions of the definitions\nof \u201cstraight line\u201d and \u201ckinetic energy\u201d in the\nlight of Einstein\u2019s theories of\n relativity.[10]\n\nThis appeal to \u201cthe containing bodies of laws and data\u201d\nessentially invokes Quine\u2019s famous holistic metaphor of the\n\u201cweb of belief\u201d with which CLT eloquently concludes:\n\n\nthe lore of our fathers is a fabric of sentences [which] develops and\nchanges, through more or less arbitrary and deliberate revisions and\nadditions of our own, more or less directly occasioned by the\ncontinuing stimulation of our sense organs. It is a pale grey lore,\nblack with fact and white with convention. But I have found no\nsubstantial reasons for concluding that there are any quite black\nthreads in it, or any white ones (CLT, p.\n 132)[11]\n\n3.4 Verification and Confirmation Holism\n\nThe picture presented in this last and many similar passages expresses\na tremendously influential view of Quine\u2019s that led several\ngenerations of philosophers to despair not only of the\nanalytic-synthetic distinction, but of the category of a\npriori knowledge entirely. The view has come to be called\n\u201cconfirmation holism,\u201d and Quine had expressed it more\nshortly a few years earlier, in his widely read article, \u201cTwo\nDogmas of Empiricism\u201d (1953 [1980a]):\n\n\nOur statements about the external world face the tribunal of sense\nexperience not individually, but only as a corporate body. (1953\n[1980a], p. 41)\n\n\nIndeed, the \u201ctwo dogmas\u201d that the article discusses are\n(i) the belief in the intelligibility of the \u201canalytic\u201d\nitself, and (ii), what Quine regards as the flip side of the same\ncoin, the belief that \u201ceach statement, taken in isolation from\nits fellows, can admit of confirmation or infirmation at all\u201d\n(p. 41), i.e., the very version of the Verifiability Theory of Meaning\nwe have seen the Positivists enlisted in their effort to\n\u201canalyze\u201d the claims of science and\n commonsense.[12]\n\nQuine bases his \u201cconfirmation holism\u201d upon observations of\nPierre Duhem (1914 [1954]), who drew attention to the myriad ways in\nwhich theories are supported by evidence, and the fact that an\nhypothesis is not (dis)confirmed merely by some specific experiment\nconsidered in isolation from an immense amount of surrounding theory.\nThus, a thermometer will be a good indication of ambient temperature\nonly if it\u2019s made of the right materials, calibrated\nappropriately, and there aren\u2019t any other forces at work that\nmight disturb the measurement\u2014and, of course, only if the\nbackground laws of physics and other beliefs that have informed the\ndesign of the measurement are sufficiently correct. A failure of the\nthermometer to measure the temperature could be due to a failure of\nany of these other conditions, which is, of course, why experimenters\nspend so much time and money constructing experiments to\n\u201ccontrol\u201d for them. Moreover, with a small change in our\ntheories or background beliefs, or just in our understanding of the\nconditions for measurement, we might change the tests on which we\nrely, but often without changing the meaning of the sentences whose\ntruth we might be trying to establish (which, as Putnam 1965 [1975]\npointed out, is precisely what practicing scientists regularly\ndo).\n\nWhat is novel\u2014and highly controversial\u2014about Quine\u2019s\nunderstanding of these commonplace observations is his extension of\nthem to claims presumed by most people (e.g., by Duhem himself) to lie\noutside their scope, viz., the whole of mathematics and even logic! It\nis this extension that seems to undermine the traditional a\npriori status of these latter domains, since it appears to open\nthe possibility of a revision of logic, mathematics and any supposed\nanalytic claims in the interest of the plausibility of the one,\noverall resulting empirical theory\u2014containing the empirical\nclaims and those of logic, mathematics and the analytic!\nPerhaps this wouldn\u2019t be so odd should the revisability of such\nclaims permit their ultimately admitting of a justification that\ndidn\u2019t involve experience. But this is ruled out by\nQuine\u2019s insistence that scientific theories, along with their\nlogic and mathematics, are confirmed \u201conly\u201d as\n\u201ccorporate\n bodies.\u201d[13]\n\nOne might wonder why, though, there have historically been virtually\nno revisions of mathematics on empirical grounds. A common example\noffered is how Riemannian replaced Euclidean geometry in\nEinstein\u2019s theory of General Relativity. But this mis-interprets\nthe history. Non-Euclidean geometries were purely conceptual\ndevelopments in the 19th C. by mathematicians such as Gauss, Riemann\nand Lobechevsky. Einstein simply argued in 1916 that one of these\nconceptual possibilities seemed to be better supported by physics than\nwas the traditional Euclidean one, and should therefore be taken to be\ntrue of actual space(-time). It is only this latter claim that is\nempirical.\n\nCertainly, though, Quine\u2019s holism has been an epistemic\npossibility that many have taken seriously. For example, influenced by\nQuine\u2019s claim, Putnam (1968 [1975]) argued that one ought to\nrevise even elementary logic in view of the surprising results of\nquantum mechanics (a proposal not without its critics, see Quantum\nLogic and Probability Theory). And in his (1962 [1975] he also\nargued that it isn\u2019t hard to imagine discovering that a\npurported analytic truth, such as Cats are animals, could be\ngiven up in light of discovering that the little things are really\ncleverly disguised robots controlled from Mars (but see Katz, 1990,\npp. 216ff and G. Russell, 2008, for replies, and the\nsupplement \u00a73 for further discussion).\n3.5 Quine on Meaning in Linguistics \n\nQuine\u2019s discussion of the role of convention in science seems\nright; but how about the role of meaning in ordinary natural language\n(cf. Chomsky\u2019s 2000 cautions mentioned in\n footnote 10)?\n Is it really true that in the \u201cpale grey lore\u201d of all the\nsentences we accept, there aren\u2019t some that are\n\u201cwhite\u201d somehow \u201cby virtue of the very meanings of\ntheir words\u201d? What about our examples in our earlier set II?\nWhat about sentences of the sort that interest Juhl and Loomis (2010)\nthat merely link patent synonyms, as in \u201cLawyers are\nattorneys,\u201d or \u201cA fortnight is a period of fourteen\ndays\u201d? As Grice and Strawson (1956) and Putnam (1965 [1975])\npointed out, it is unlikely that so intuitively plausible a\ndistinction should turn out to have no basis at all in\nfact.\n\nQuine addressed this issue, first, in his (1953 [1980a], chapter 3),\nand then in a much larger way in his (1960, chapter 2, and 1974) and\nrelated articles. In his (1953 [1980a]) he pressed his objection to\nanalyticity further to the very ideas of synonymy and the linguistic\nmeaning of an expression, on which, we saw, Frege\u2019s criterion of\nanalyticity crucially relied. His objection is that he sees no way to\nmake any serious explanatory sense of them. He explored plausible\nexplanations in terms of \u201cdefinition,\u201d\n\u201cintension,\u201d \u201cpossibility,\u201d and\n\u201ccontradiction,\u201d, pointing out that each of these notions\nseems to stand in precisely as much need of explanation as synonymy\nitself (recall our observation in \u00a71.2 above regarding the lack\nof any formal contradiction in \u201cSome pediatricans\naren\u2019t doctors\u201d). The terms seem to be mutually definable\nin what seems to be a\u2014viciously?\u2014small \u201cclosed curve\nin space\u201d (Quine 1953 [1980a], p. 30). Though they might be\ninvoked to explain one another, they could not in the end answer the\nchallenge of how to distinguish an analytic claim from simply a\ntenaciously held belief.\n\nTo take a recent example, David Chalmers (2012) revisits\nCarnap\u2019s (1956b) proposal for basing synonymy on\n\u201cintension\u201d by way of eliciting a person\u2019s judgments\nabout the extension of a term/concept in all possible\n worlds:[14]\n\n\nCarnap\u2019s key idea is that we can investigate the intension that\na subject associated with an expression by investigating the\nsubject\u2019s judgments about possible cases. To determine the\nintension of an expression such as \u2018Pferd\u2019 for a subject,\nwe present the subject with descriptions of various logically possible\ncases, and we ask the subject whether he or she is willing to apply\nthe term \u2018Pferd\u2019 to objects specified in these cases. If\nwe do this for enough cases, then we can test all sorts of hypotheses\nabout the intension of the expression. (Chalmers 2012, p. 204)\n\n\nBut how are the informants to understand the questions they\u2019re\nbeing asked? If they understand the term \u201cpossible\u201d as\nlogicians do, as truth in a set-theoretically specified\nmodel, then it will be too weak: there are obviously models in\nwhich synonymous expressions e.g., \u201chorse\u201d and\n\u201cPferd,\u201d or \u201cbachelor\u201d and \u201cunmarried\nmale\u201d are assigned non-overlapping sets (cf. Quine\n[1953 [1980a], pp. 22\u20133), so that it\u2019s logically possible\nfor there be a horse that\u2019s not a Pferd, or a bachelor\nthat\u2019s married (again, \u201ca married bachelor\u201d is\nformally contradictory only if one substitutes synonyms for synonyms;\nbut we certainly can\u2019t appeal to synonymy in trying to\ndefine synonymy). But if \u201cpossible\u201d is understood\n(as it ordinarily would be) as merely imaginable, then it\nwill be far too strong, ruling out ideas that the scientifically\nunder-informed might find impossible, e.g., curved space-time,\nsomething having the properties of both waves and particles, or\ncompletely unconscious thoughts (which, at least, e.g., John Searle\n1992, pp. 155\u20136, and Galen Strawson 1994, pp. 166\u20137 report\nhaving trouble conceiving). As Quine (1953 [1980a]) famously argued,\nsuch appeals to informant verdicts will only work if the informants\nunderstand the questions as about the very terms the proposed test\nis supposed to define, viz., \u201cpossible\u201d as\nconstrained by synonymy or preservation of meaning. Although, as many\nhave noted (e.g., Williamson 2007, p. 50), there may be explanatory\ncircularities in the best of theories, the circularity here seems\nparticularly vicious, with the relevant ideas appearing not to perform\nany explanatory work other than bringing in each other\u2019s\nlaundry.\n\nWhy was Quine so convinced of this last claim? Because he thought it\nwas possible to provide a satisfactory explanation of human language\nwithout them, indeed, without any mentalistic notions at all. In his\n(1953 [1980b], 1960 [2013] and 1974) he sketched a behavioristic\ntheory of language that doesn\u2019t rely on the postulation of\ndeterminate meaning or reference, and argued that, indeed, translation\nis \u201cindeterminate\u201d: there is \u201cno fact of the\nmatter\u201d about whether two expressions do or do not have the same\nmeaning (see Indeterminacy of Translation). This would appear\nto imply that there are pretty much no facts of the matter about\npeople\u2019s mental lives at all! For, if there is no fact of the\nmatter about whether two people mean the same thing by their words,\nthen there is no fact of the matter about the content of\nanyone\u2019s thoughts. Quine himself took this consequence in\nstride\u2014he was, after all, a behaviorist\u2013 regarding it as\n\u201cof a piece\u201d with Franz Brentano\u2019s (1874 [1995])\nfamous thesis of the \u201cirreducibility of the intentional\u201d;\nit\u2019s just that for him, unlike for Brentano, it simply showed\nthe \u201cbaselessness of intentional idioms and the emptiness of a\nscience of intention\u201d (1960 [2013], p. 202). Needless to say,\nmany subsequent philosophers have not been happy with this view, and\nhave wondered where Quine\u2019s argument went wrong.\n3.6 Explaining Away the Appearance of the Analytic\n\nOne problem many have had with Quine\u2019s argument is about how to\nexplain the appearance of the analytic. It just seems an\nempirical fact that most people would spontaneously distinguish our\noriginal two sets of sentences (\u00a71) by saying that sentences of\nthe second set, such as \u201cAll pediatricians are doctors for\nchildren\u201d are \u201ctrue by definition,\u201d or could be\nknown to be true just by knowing the meanings of the constituent\nwords. Moreover, they might agree about an indefinite number of\nfurther examples, e.g., that ophthalmologists are eye doctors,\ngrandfathers are parents of parents, sauntering a kind of movement,\npain and beliefs mental states, and promising an intentional act.\nAgain, as Grice and Strawson (1956) and Putnam (1965 [1975]) stressed,\nit\u2019s implausible to suppose that there\u2019s nothing\npeople are getting at in these judgments.\n3.6.1 Centrality\n\nQuine\u2019s (1953 [1980a]) initial explanation of the appearance of\nthe analytic invoked his metaphor of the web of belief, claiming that\nsentences are more or less revisable, depending upon how\n\u201cperipheral\u201d or \u201ccentral\u201d their position is in\nthe web, the more peripheral ones being closer to experience. The\nappearance of sentences being \u201canalytic\u201d is simply due to\ntheir being, like the laws of logic and mathematics, comparatively\ncentral, and so are given up, if ever, only under extreme pressure\nfrom the peripheral forces of experience. But no sentence is\nabsolutely immune from revision; all sentences are thereby empirical,\nand none is actually analytic.\n\nThere are a number of problems with this explanation. In the first\nplace, centrality and the appearance of analyticity don\u2019t seem\nto be so closely related. As Quine (1960, p. 66) himself noted, there\nare are plenty of central, unrevisable beliefs that don\u2019t seem\nremotely analytic, e.g., \u201cThere have been black dogs,\u201d\n\u201cThe earth has existed for more than five minutes,\u201d\n\u201cMass-energy is conserved\u201d; and many standard examples of\nwhat seem analytic aren\u2019t seriously central: \u201cBachelors\nare unmarried,\u201d \u201cA fortnight is two weeks\u201d or\n\u201cA beard is facial hair\u201d are pretty trivial verbal issues,\nand could easily be revised if people really cared (cf., Juhl and\nLoomis, 2010, p. 118).\n\nSecondly, it\u2019s not mere unrevisability that seems distinctive of\nthe analytic, but rather a certain sort of unintelligibility:\nfor all the unrevisability of \u201cThere have been black\ndogs,\u201d it\u2019s perfectly possible to imagine it to\nbe false. In contrast, what\u2019s peculiar about analytic claims is\nthat their denials often seem peculiarly impossible to seriously\nthink: it seems distinctively impossible to imagine a married\nbachelor. Now, of course, as we noted, this could be due simply to a\nfailure of imagination. But what\u2019s striking about about the\nunrevisability of many apparently analytic cases is that they\ndon\u2019t appear to be like scientifically controversial cases such\nas curved space-time or completely unconscious thoughts. The standard\ncases about, e.g., bachelors or pediatricians seem entirely innocuous.\nFar from unrevisability explaining analyticity, it would seem to\nbe analyticity that explains this peculiar unrevisability: the\nonly reason someone might balk at denying bachelors are unmarried is\nthat, well, that\u2019s just what the word \u201cbachelor\u201d\n means![15]\n The challenge, though, is to clarify the basis for this sort of\nexplanation.\n\nIt is important to note here a crucial change that Quine (and earlier\nPositivists) casually introduced into the characterization of the\na priori, and consequently into much of the now common\nunderstanding of the analytic. Where Kant and others had traditionally\nassumed that the a priori concerned beliefs\n\u201cjustifiable independently of experience,\u201d Quine and many\nother philosophers of the time came to regard it as consisting of\nbeliefs \u201cunrevisable in the light of experience.\u201d And, as\nwe have seen, a similar status is accorded the at least apparently\nanalytic. However, this would imply that people taking something to be\nanalytic or a priori would have to regard themselves as being\ninfallible about it, forever unwilling to revise it in light\nof further evidence or argument. But this is a further claim that many\ndefenders of the traditional notions need not embrace (consider,\nagain, the disputes philosophers have about the proper analysis of\nterms such as \u201cknowledge\u201d or \u201cfreedom\u201d).\n\nIndeed, a claim might be in fact analytic and justifiable\nindependently of experience, but nevertheless perfectly well revised\nin the light of it. Experience, after all, might mislead us, as it\n(perhaps) misled Putnam when he suggested revising logic in light of\ndifficulties in quantum mechanics, or suggested revising \u201ccats\nare animals,\u201d were we to discover the things were robots. Just\nwhich claims are genuinely analytic and a priori might not be\navailable in the \u201carmchair\u201d at the introspective or\nbehavioral surface of our lives in the way that Quine and much of the\nphilosophical tradition has assumed. Certainly the \u201cdispositions\nto assent or dissent from sentences\u201d on which Quine (1960\n[2013], chapter 2) standardly relied are likely very dubious guides\n(see the findings of \u201cexperimental philosophy\u201d discussed\nin \u00a74.1 below). Behavioral dispositions in general may have any\nof a variety of aetiologies that aren\u2019t clearly distinguishable\nin actual behavior (one wonders how much of Quine\u2019s seamless\nepistemology went hand in hand with his mentalistically seamless\nbehavioristic psychology). The relevant dispositions might be hidden\nmore deeply in our minds, and our access to them as fallible as our\naccess to any other such facts about ourselves. The genuinely analytic\nmay be a matter of difficult reflective analysis or deep linguistic\ntheory (see Bealer, 1987, Bonjour 1998, Rey, 1998, and\nsupplement), a possibility to which we will return\nshortly.\n3.6.2 One Criterion Concepts\n\nIn his expansion of Quine\u2019s point, Putnam (1962 [1975]) tried to\nrescue what he thought were theoretically innocuous examples of\nanalytic truths by appeal to what he called\n\u201cone-criterion\u201d concepts, or concepts like, e.g.,\npediatrician, bachelor, widow, where there seems to be only\none \u201cway to tell\u201d whether they apply. However, as Fodor\n(1998) pointed out, so stated, this latter account won\u2019t suffice\neither, since the notion of \u201ccriterion\u201d seems no better\noff than \u201cmeaning\u201d or \u201canalytic.\u201d Moreover, if\nthere were one way to tell what\u2019s what, there would seem,\ntrivially, to be indefinite numbers of other ways: look for some\nreliable correlate (living alone, frequenting singles bars for\n\u201cbachelor\u201d), or, just ask someone who knows the one way;\nor ask someone who knows someone who knows; or\u2026, etc., and so\nnow we would be faced with saying which of these ways is genuinely\n\u201ccriterial,\u201d which would seem to leave us with the same\nproblem we faced in saying which way appears to be\n\u201canalytic.\u201d\n\nFodor (1998) tried to improve on Putnam\u2019s proposal by suggesting\nthat a criterion that appears to be analytic is the one on which all\nthe other criteria depend, but which does not depend upon them. Thus,\ntelling that someone is a bachelor by checking out his gender and\nmarriage status doesn\u2019t depend upon telling by asking his\nfriends, but telling by asking his friends does depend upon telling by\nhis gender and marriage status; and so we have an explanation of why\n\u201cbachelors are unmarried males\u201d seems analytic, but, said\nFodor, without it\u2019s actually being so (perhaps somewhat\nsurprisingly, given his general \u201casymmetric dependence\u201d\ntheory of content, see his 1990b and Rey, 2009, to be discussed\nshortly, \u00a7\u00a74.2\u20134.3).\n\nHowever, such asymmetric dependencies among criteria alone will not\n\u201cexplain (away)\u201d either the reality or the appearance of\nthe analytic, since there would appear to be asymmetric dependencies\nof the proposed sort in non-analytic cases. Natural kinds are dramatic\ncases in point (see Putnam 1962 [1975], 1970 [1975], 1975). At some\nstage in history probably the only way anyone could tell whether\nsomething was a case of polio was to see whether there was a certain\nconstellation of standard symptoms, e.g. paralysis; other ways\n(including asking others) asymmetrically depended upon that way. But\nthis wouldn\u2019t make \u201cAll polio cases exhibit\nparalysis\u201d remotely analytic\u2014after all, the standard\nsymptoms for many diseases can sometimes be quite misleading. It\nrequired serious empirical research to discover the proper definition\nof a natural kind term like \u201cpolio.\u201d Precisely as Putnam\notherwise stressed, methods of testing are so variable it is doubtful\nthat even \u201csingle criterion\u201d tests could provide a basis\nfor the identification of the stable meanings of words.\n\nIndeed, as many philosophers in the wake of Quine\u2019s and\nPutnam\u2019s work came to suspect, the recourse of philosophy in\ngeneral to epistemology to ground semantics may have been a\nfundamental mistake. It was an enticing recourse: it seemed to offer a\nway to dispatch philosophical disputes and secure empirical knowledge\nfrom sceptical challenges regarding demons and dreams. But the above\ndifficulties suggested that those disputes and challenges would need\nto be met in some other way, perhaps by looking not to words, but to\nthe world instead.\n3.6.3 The World, not Words\n\nIndeed, another strategy that a Quinean can deploy to explain the\nappearance of the analytic is to claim that analyses are really not of\nthe meanings of words, but of the actual phenomena in the\nworld to which they refer (see Fodor, 1990b, 1998). Thus, claims\nthat, e.g., cats are animals, triangles are three-sided, or that every\nnumber has a successor should not be construed as claims about the\nmeanings of the words \u201ccat\u201d, \u201ctriangle\u201d or\n\u201cnumber,\u201d but about the nature of cats,\ntriangles and numbers themselves. Arguably, many such\nclaims, if they are true, are necessarily so (cf., Kripke,\n1972; Putnam, 1975), and may be commonly understood to be, and this\nmight make them seem analytic. But then we would be faced with\nprecisely the challenge that Quine raised: how to distinguish claims\nof analyticity from simply deeply held beliefs about \u201cthe\nnature\u201d of things.\n\nThis recourse to the world may, however, be a little too swift. Cases\nof (arguably) deeply explanatory natural kinds such as polio\nor cats contrast dramatically with cases of more superficial\nkinds like bachelor or fortnight. whose natures are\nnot specified by any explanatory science, but are pretty much\nexhausted by what would seem to be the meanings of the words. Again,\nunlike the case of polio and its symptoms, the reason that gender and\nmarriage status are the best way to tell whether someone is a bachelor\nis, again, that that\u2019s just what \u201cbachelor\u201d means.\nIndeed, should a doctor propose revising the test for polio in the\nlight of better theory\u2014perhaps reversing the dependency of\ncertain tests\u2014this would not even begin to appear to involve a\nchange in the meaning of the term. Should, however, a feminist\npropose, in the light of better politics, revising the use of\n\u201cbachelor\u201d to include women, this obviously would. If the\nappearance of the analytic is to be explained away, it needs to\naccount for such differences in our understanding of different sorts\nof revisions in our beliefs, which don\u2019t appear to be\nissues regarding the external world.\n4. Post-Quinean Strategies\n\nThere has been a wide variety of responses to Quine\u2019s\nchallenges. Some, for example, Davidson (1980), Stich (1983) and\nDennett (1987), seem simply to accept it and try to account for our\npractice of meaning ascription within its \u201cnon-factual\u201d\nbounds. Since they follow Quine in at least claiming to forswear the\nanalytic, we will not consider their views further here. Others, who\nmight be (loosely) called \u201cneo-Cartesians,\u201d reject\nQuine\u2019s attack as simply so much prejudice of the empiricism and\nnaturalism that they take to be his own uncritical dogmas (\u00a74.1\nin what follows). Still others hope simply to find a way to break out\nof the \u201cintentional circle,\u201d and provide an account of at\nleast what it means for one thing (a state of the brain, for example)\nto mean (or \u201ccarry the information about\u201d) another\nexternal phenomenon in the world (\u00a74.2). Perhaps the most\ntrenchant reaction has been that of empirically oriented linguists and\nphilosophers, who look to a specific explanatory role the analytic may\nplay in an account of thought and talk (\u00a74.3). This role is\ncurrently being explored in considerable detail in the now various\nareas of research inspired by the important linguistic theories of\nNoam Chomsky (\u00a74.4, and supplement, Analyticity and Chomskyan\nLinguistics).\n4.1 Neo-Cartesianism\n\nThe most unsympathetic response to Quine\u2019s challenges has been\nessentially to stare him down and insist upon an inner faculty of\n\u201cintuition\u201d whereby the truth of certain claims is simply\n\u201cgrasped\u201d directly through, as Bonjour (1998) puts it:\n\n\nan act of rational insight or rational intuition \u2026 [that] is\nseemingly (a) direct or immediate, nondiscursive, and yet also (b)\nintellectual or reason-governed \u2026 [It] depends upon nothing\nbeyond an understanding of the propositional content itself\u2026.\n(p. 102)\n\n\nBealer (1987, 1999) defends similar proposals. Neither Bonjour nor\nBealer are in fact particularly concerned to defend the analytic by\nsuch claims, but their recourse to mere understanding of propositional\ncontent is certainly what many defenders of the analytic have had in\nmind. Katz (1998, pp. 44\u20135), for example, explicitly made the\nvery same appeal to intuitions on behalf of the analytic claims\nsupported by his semantic theory. Somewhat more modestly, Peacocke\n(1992, 2004) claims that possession of certain logical concepts\nrequires that a person find certain inferences \u201cprimitively\ncompelling,\u201d or compelling not by reason of some inference that\ntakes \u201ctheir correctness\u2026as answerable to anything\nelse\u201d (1992, p. 6; see also his 2004, p. 100 and the other\nreferences in fn 9 above for the strategy, and fn 7, as well as\nHarman, 1996 [1999], and Horwich, 2000, for qualms).\n\nPerhaps the simplest reply along these lines emerges from a suggestion\nof David Lewis (1972 [1980]), who proposes to implicitly define, e.g.,\npsychological terms by conjoining the \u201cplatitudes\u201d in\nwhich they appear:\n\n\nInclude only platitudes that are common knowledge among us \u2013\neveryone knows them, everyone knows that everyone else knows them, and\nso on. For the meanings of our words are common knowledge, and I am\ngoing to claim that names of mental states derive their meaning from\nthese platitudes. (1972 [1980], p. 212)\n\n\nEnlarging on this idea, Frank Jackson (1998) emphasizes the role of\nintuitions about possible cases, as well as the need sometimes to\nmassage such intuitions so as to arrive at \u201cthe hypothesis that\nbest makes sense of [folk] responses\u201d (p. 36; see also pp.\n 34\u20135).[16]\n\nThe Quinean reply to all these approaches is, again, his main\nchallenge: how in the end are we to distinguish such claims of\n\u201crational insight,\u201d \u201cprimitive compulsion,\u201d\ninferential practices or folk beliefs, from merely some deeply\nentrenched empirical convictions, folk practices or, indeed, from mere\ndogmas? Isn\u2019t the history of thought littered with what have\nturned out to be deeply mistaken claims, inferences and platitudes\nthat people at the time have found \u201crationally\u201d and/or\n\u201cprimitively compelling,\u201d say, with regard to God, sin,\ndisease, biology, sexuality, or even patterns of reasoning themselves?\nAgain, consider the resistance Kahneman (2011) reports people\ndisplaying to correction of the fallacies they commit in a surprising\nrange of ordinary thought (cf. fn 7 above); or in a more disturbing\nvein, how the gifted mathematician, John Nash, claimed that his\ndelusional ideas \u201cabout supernatural beings came to me the same\nway that my mathematical ideas did\u201d (Nasar 1998, p. 11).\nIntrospected episodes, primitive compulsions, intuitions about\npossibilities, or even tacit folk theories alone are not going to\ndistinguish the analytic, since these all may be due as much to\npeople\u2019s (possibly mad!) empirical theories as to any special\nknowledge of meaning.\n\nA particularly vivid way to feel the force of Quine\u2019s challenge\nis afforded by a recent case that came before the Ontario Supreme\nCourt concerning whether laws that confined marriage to heterosexual\ncouples violated the equal protection clause of the constitution (see\nHalpern et al. 2001). The question was regarded as turning in\npart on the meaning of the word \u201cmarriage\u201d, and each party\nto the dispute solicited affidavits from philosophers, one of whom\nclaimed that the meaning of the word was tied to\nheterosexuality, another that it wasn\u2019t. Putting aside\nthe complex moral-political issues, Quine\u2019s challenge can be\nregarded as a reasonably sceptical request to know how any serious\ntheory of the world might settle it. It certainly wouldn\u2019t be\nsufficient merely to claim that marriage is/isn\u2019t necessarily\nheterosexual on the basis of common \u201cplatitudes,\u201d much\nless on \u201can act of rational insight [into] the propositional\ncontent itself\u201d; or because speakers found the inference from\nmarriage to heterosexuality \u201cprimitively compelling\u201d and\ncouldn\u2019t imagine gay people getting\n married![17]\n\nIndeed, some philosophers have offered some empirical evidence that\ncasts doubt on just how robust the data for the analytic might be. The\nmovement of \u201cexperimental philosophy\u201d has pointed to\nevidence of considerable malleability of subject\u2019s\n\u201cintuitions\u201d with regard to the standard kinds of thought\nexperiments on which philosophical defenses of analytic claims\ntypically rely. Thus, Weinberg, Nichols and Stich (2001) found\nsignificant cultural differences between responses of Asian and\nWestern students regarding whether someone counted as having knowledge\nin a standard \u201cGettier\u201d (1963) example of accidental\njustified true belief; and Knobe (2003) found that\nnon-philosophers\u2019 judgments about whether an action is\nintentional depended on the (particularly negative) moral qualities of\nthe action, and not, as is presumed by most philosophers, on whether\nthe action was merely intended by the agent. Questions, of course,\ncould be raised about these experimental results (How well did the\nsubjects understand the project of assessing intuitions? Did the\nexperiments sufficiently control for the multitudinous\n\u201cpragmatic\u201d effects endemic to polling procedures? To what\nextent are the target terms merely polysemous \u2013 see\nsupplement, \u00a73\u2013 allowing for different uses in\ndifferent contexts?) However, the results do serve to show how the\ndetermination of meaning and analytic truths can be regarded as a far\nmore difficult empirical question than philosophers have traditionally\nsupposed (see Bishop and Trout, 2005, and Alexander and Weinberg,\n2007, for further discussion).\n4.2 Externalist Theories of Meaning\n\nDeveloping the strategy of \u00a73.3C above, Externalist theories of\nmeaning (or \u201ccontent\u201d) try to meet at least part of\nQuine\u2019s challenge by considering how matters of meaning need not\nrely on epistemic. or really any internal\nconnections among thoughts or beliefs, in the way that many\nphilosophers had traditionally supposed, but as involving largely\ncausal and social relations between uses of words and the phenomena in\nthe world that they pick out. This suggestion gradually emerged in the\nwork of Putnam (1962 [1975], 1965 [1975] and 1975), Kripke (1972\n[1980]) and Burge (1979, 1986), but it took the form of positive\ntheories in, e.g., the work of Devitt (1981, 2015), Dretske (1988) and\nFodor (1990b), who tried to base meaning in various actual or\nco-variational causal relations between states of the mind/brain and\nexternal phenomena (see Indicator Semantics; as well as the\nwork on \u201cteleosemantics\u201d of Millikan, 1984), Papineau,\n1987, and Neander, 1995, 2017, who look to mechanisms of natural\nselection; see Teleological Theories of Mental Content).\n\nConsider, for example, Fodor\u2019s proposal. Simplifying it\nslightly, Fodor (1990b) claimed that\n\n\na symbol S means p if\n\n(i)\nunder some conditions, C, it\u2019s a law that S\nis entokened iff p, and\n(ii)\nany other tokening of S synchronically depends upon (i),\nbut not vice versa.\n\n\n\nThus, tokenings of \u201chorse\u201d mean horse because\nthere are (say, optimal viewing) conditions under which tokenings of\n\u201chorse\u201d co-vary with horses, and tokenings of\n\u201chorse\u201d caused by cows asymmetrically depend upon that\nfact. The intuitive idea here is that what makes \u201chorse\u201d\nmean horse is that errors and other tokenings of\n\u201chorse\u201d in the absence of horses (e.g., dreaming of them)\ndepend upon being able to get things right, but not vice\nversa: getting things right doesn\u2019t depend upon getting\nthem wrong. The law in (i), so to say, \u201cgoverns\u201d the\ntokenings of (ii). (Note that this condition is metaphysical,\nappealing to actual laws of entokenings, and not upon\nasymmetric dependencies between epistemic criteria suggested\nby Fodor in his defense of Putnam we discussed in \u00a73.6.2.)\n\nFodor\u2019s and related proposals are not without their problems\n(see Loewer, 1996, Rey, 2009 and Causal Theories of Mental\nContent). Nevertheless, it\u2019s worth noting that,\nwere such theories to succeed in providing the kind of\nexplanatorily adequate, non-circular account of intentionality to\nwhich they aspire, they would go some way towards saving at least\nintentional psychology from Quine\u2019s attack, and provide at least\none prima facie plausible, naturalistic strategy for\ndistinguishing facts about meaning from facts about mere belief. The\nproposals, unlike those in the traditions of Carnap or of\nneo-Cartesians, have at least the form of a serious\nreply.\n\nHowever, even if such externalist strategies, either Fodor\u2019s or\nteleosemantic ones, were to save intentionality and meaning, they\nwould do so only by forsaking the high hopes we noted in \u00a72\nphilosophers harbored for the analytic. For externalists are typically\ncommitted to counting expressions as \u201csynonymous\u201d if they\nhappen to be linked in the right way to the same external phenomena,\neven if a thinker couldn\u2019t realize that they are by a\npriori (or, at any rate, \u201carmchair\u201d) reflection\nalone. By at least the Fregean substitution criterion (\u00a71.2),\nthey would seem to be committed to counting as \u201canalytic\u201d\nmany patently empirical sentences as \u201cWater is H2O,\u201d\n\u201cSalt is NaCl\u201d or \u201cMark Twain is Samuel\nClemens,\u201d since in each of these cases, something may co-vary in\nthe relevant way with tokenings of the expression on one side of the\nidentity if and only if it co-varies with tokenings of the one on the\nother (similar problems and others arise for teleosemantics; see Fodor\n1990b, pp. 72\u201373).\n\nOf course, along the lines of the worldly turn we noted in\n\u00a73.6.3, an externalist might cheerfully just allow that some\nsentences, e.g., \u201cwater is H20,\u201d are in fact analytic,\neven though they are \u201cexternal\u201d and subject to empirical\n(dis)confirmation. Such a view would actually comport well with an\nolder philosophical tradition less interested in the meanings of our\nwords and concepts, and more interested in the\n\u201cessences\u201d of the worldly phenomena they pick\nout. Locke (1690 [1975], II, 31, vi), for example, posited\n\u201creal\u201d essences of things rather along the lines\nresuscitated by Putnam (1975) and Kripke (1972 [1980]), the real\nessences being the conditions in the world independent of our thought\nthat make something the thing it is. Thus, being H2O may be\nwhat makes something water, and (to take the striking\nexamples of diseases noted by Putnam, 1962 [1975]) being the\nactivation of a certain virus is what makes something polio. But, of\ncourse, such an external view would still dash the hopes of\nphilosophers looking to the analytic to explain a priori\nknowledge (but see Bealer 1987 and Jackson 1998 for strategies to\nassimilate such empirical cases to nevertheless a priori,\narmchair analysis). Such a consequence, however, might not faze an\nexternalist like Fodor (1998), who is concerned only to save\nintentional psychology, and might otherwise share Quine\u2019s\nscepticism about the analytic and the a priori.\n\nTwo final problems, however, loom over any such externalist\nstrategies. One is how to provide content to\n\u201cresponse-dependent\u201d terms, such as\n\u201cinteresting,\u201d \u201camusing,\u201d \u201csexy,\u201d\n\u201cworrisome,\u201d whose extensions vary greatly with users and\noccasions. What seems crucial to the contents of such terms is not any\nexternalia that they might pick out, but simply some\ninternal reactions of thinkers that might vary among them\neven under all conditions, but without difference in meaning.\nAt any rate, there\u2019s no reason to suppose there\u2019s any sort\nof law that links the same phenomena to different people who find\ndifferent things \u201cinteresting,\u201d \u201cfunny,\u201d or\neven \u201cgreen\u201d (cf. Russell, 1912; Hardin, 2008). The other\nproblem is how to distinguish necessarily empty terms that\npurport to refer to (arguably) impossible phenomena such as perfectly\nflat surfaces, Euclidean figures, fictional characters or immortal\nsouls. An externalist would seem to be committed to treating all such\nterms as synonymous, despite, of course, the fact that thoughts about\nthem should obviously be distinguished (see Rey, 2009).\n4.3 Internal Dependencies\n\nA promising strategy for replying to these latter problems, as well as\nto Quine\u2019s challenge in a way that might even begin to provide\nwhat the neo-Cartesian wants, can be found in a proposal of Paul\nHorwich (1998, 2005). He emphasizes how the meaning properties of a\nterm are the ones that play a \u201cbasic explanatory role\u201d\nwith regard to the use of a term generally, the ones ultimately in\nvirtue of which a term is used with that meaning. For example, the use\nof \u201cred\u201d to refer to the color of blood, roses, stop\nsigns, etc,. is arguably explained by its use to refer to certain\napparent colors in good light, but not vice versa: the latter\nuse is \u201cbasic\u201d to all the other uses. Similarly, uses of\n\u201cand\u201d explanatorily depend upon its basic use in\ninferences to and from the sentences it conjoins, and number terms to\nitems in a sequence respecting Peano\u2019s axioms (Horwich,\n1998:45,129; see also Devitt 1996, 2002 for a similar proposal).\n\nAlthough by allowing for purely internal explanatory conditions, this\nstrategy offers a way to deal with response-dependent and necessarily\nempty terms, and promises a way of distinguishing analyticities from\nmere beliefs, there are still several further potential problems it\nfaces. The first is that merely appealing to a \u201cbasic\nexplanatory\u201d condition for the use of a word doesn\u2019t\ndistinguish misuses and metaphors from etymologies, derived idioms and\n\u201cdead metaphors\u201d: saying \u201cJuliet is the sun\u201d\ncan be explained by the use of \u201csun\u201d to refer to the sun,\nbut so can \u201clobbying\u201d be explained by the use of\n\u201clobby\u201d for lobbies of buildings (where politicians often\nmet), and \u201cthe eye of a needle\u201d by the shape of an animal\neye. In these latter cases, the words seem to be \u201cfrozen\u201d\nor \u201cdead\u201d metaphors, taking on meanings of their own.\nWhile they are explained by original \u201cbasic\u201d\nuses, they are no longer \u201cgoverned\u201d by them.\n\nHere it may be worth combining something of the Horwich view with\nsomething of Fodor\u2019s aforementioned cousin suggestion of the\nasymmetric counterfactual (\u00a74.2), along lines suggested by Rey\n(2009; 2020a, \u00a710.3): the new \u201cdead\u201d uses of an idiom\nor metaphor no longer asymmetrically depend upon the\nexplanatorily basic use. \u201cEye of a needle\u201d would still\nmean the hole at the end of a needle, even if \u201ceye\u201d no\nlonger referred to animal eyes. But \u201ceye\u201d used to refer\nto, say, the drawing of an eye, would both asymmetrically and\nexplanatorily depend upon its being used to refer to actual eyes. And\ndescribing a three-way correspondence as \u201ctriangular\u201d may\nasymmetrically and explanatorily depend upon thinking of certain\ngeometric figures as triangular, but not vice versa \u2013\ndespite the impossibility of there ever being any actual triangles in\nthe external world (see Allott and Textor, 2022, for development of\nthis suggestion). Taking the asymmetric dependency to be\n\u201cinternally\u201d explanatory relieves it of the excessive\nexternalism with which Fodor burdened it, while avoiding the\netymologies and dead metaphors facing Horwich\u2019s view on its\nown.\n\nHowever, although such a proposal may offer a promising strategy for\nmeeting Quine\u2019s challenge about many ordinary terms, it\nisn\u2019t clear it would work for highly theoretic ones. For if\nQuine (1953 [1980a]) is right about even a limited holism involved in\nthe use of scientific terms, then there may be no sufficiently local\nbasic facts on which all other uses of a term asymmetrically and\nexplanatorily depend. To take the kind of case that most interested\nQuine, it certainly seems unlikely that there is some small set of\nuses of, say, \u201cnumber,\u201d \u201cpositron,\u201d\n\u201cspace\u201d or \u201cbiological species\u201d that are\nexplanatorily basic, on which all other uses really depend. Such terms\noften come with a large cluster of terms appearing in claims that come\nas, so to say, a loose \u201cpackage deal,\u201d and revision over\ntime may touch any particular claim in the interests of overall\nexplanatory adequacy. Uses of a term involved in the expression of\nbelief, either in thought or talk, will likely be justified and\nexplained by the same processes of holistic confirmation that led\nQuine to his scepticism about the analytic in the first place (cf.\nGibbard, 2008). Of course, Quine might be wrong about taking the case\nof theoretic terms in science to be representative of terms in human\npsychology generally (cf. Chomsky, 2000,\n footnote 10\n above), and the above proposal might be confined to some restricted\nportions of a speaker\u2019s psychology, e.g., to perception (as in\nFodor, 1983, 2000). But, to put it mildly, the verdict on these issues\nis not quite in (see supplement \u00a7\u00a74\u20135).\n\nLastly, a third (and, for some, a serious) possible drawback of this\nstrategy is that it still risks rendering matters of meaning far less\n\u201ctransparent\u201d and introspectively accessible than\nphilosophers have standardly supposed. There is little reason to\nsuppose that what is asymmetrically-explanatorily basic about\none\u2019s use of a term in thought or talk is a matter that is\navailable to introspection or armchair reflection. As in the case of\n\u201cmarriage\u201d mentioned earlier, but certainly with respect\nto other philosophically problematic notions, just which properties,\nif any, are explanatorily basic may not be an issue that is at all\neasy to determine. What are the asymmetric-explanatorily basic uses of\n\u201cfreedom\u201d or \u201csoul\u201d? Do even people\u2019s\nuses of animal terms really depend upon dubbings of species \u2013 or\nof individual exemplars \u2013 or do they depend more upon an innate\ndisposition to think in terms of underlying biological kinds (cf. Keil\n2014, pp. 327\u2013333)? Do their uses of number words and concepts\nreally depend upon their grasp of Peano\u2019s axioms? Perhaps the\nusage is grounded more in practices of (finite) counting, estimates\nand noticing merely finite one-to-one correspondences; or\nperhaps they lie in the general recursive character of\nlanguage (cf. Hauser et al 2002). Again, one may need the\nresources of a psychology that delves into far more deeply into the\ncomplex, internal causal relations in the mind than are available at\nits introspective or behavioral surface.\n4.4 Chomskyan Strategies\n\nSuch an interest in a deeper and richer internal psychology\nemerged most dramatically in the 1950s in the work of Noam Chomsky. In\nhis (1957, 1965, 1968 [2006]) he began to revolutionize linguistics by\npresenting substantial evidence and arguments for the existence of an\ninnate \u201cgenerative\u201d grammar in a special language faculty\nin people\u2019s brains that he argued was responsible for their\nunderlying competence to speak and understand natural languages. This\nopened up the possibility of a response to Quine\u2019s (1960)\nscepticism about the analytic within his own naturalistic framework,\nsimply freed of its odd behaviorism, which Chomsky and others had\nindependently, empirically refuted (see Chomsky 1959, and Gleitman,\nGross and Reisberg 2011, chapter 7). Some of it also dovetails nicely\nwith ideas of Friedrich Waismann and the later Wittgenstein, as well\nas with important recent work on polysemy. But the program Chomsky\ninitiated is complex, and its relation to the analytic quite\ncontroversial, and so discussion of it is relegated to the following\nsupplement to this entry:\n\nSupplement: Analyticity and Chomskyan Linguistics.\n \n5. Conclusion\n\nSuppose, per the discussion of at least \u00a73 of the\nsupplement, that linguistics were to succeed in\ndelineating a class of analytic sentences grounded in the constraints\nof a special language faculty in the way that some Chomskyans\nsometimes seem to suggest. Would such sentences serve the purposes for\nwhich we noted earlier (\u00a72) philosophers had enlisted them?\nPerhaps some of them would. An empirical grounding of the analytic\nmight provide us with an understanding of what constitutes a\nperson\u2019s competence with specific words and concepts,\nparticularly logical or mathematical ones. Given that Quinean\nscepticism about the analytic is a source of his scepticism about the\ndeterminacy of cognitive states (see \u00a73.5 above), such a\ngrounding may be crucial for a realistic psychology, determining the\nconditions under which someone has a thought with a specific\ncontent.\n\nMoreover, setting out the constitutive conditions for possessing a\nconcept might be of some interest to philosophers generally, since\nmany of the crucial questions they ask concern the proper\nunderstanding of ordinary notions such as material object, person,\naction, freedom, god, the good, or the beautiful.\nSuppose, further, that a domain, such as perhaps ethics or aesthetics,\nis \u201cresponse dependent,\u201d constituted by the\nunderlying rules of our words and concepts; suppose, that is, that\nthese rules constitute the nature of, say, the good, the\nfunny, or the beautiful. If so, then it might not be\nimplausible to claim that successful conceptual analysis could provide\nus with some a priori knowledge of such domains (although,\nagain, sorting out the rules may require empirical linguistic and\npsychological theories not available to \u201carmchair\nreflection\u201d).\n\nBut, of course, many philosophers have wanted more than these\nessentially psychological gains. They have hoped that analytic claims\nmight provide a basis for a priori knowledge of domains that\nexist independently of us and are not exhausted by our concepts. An\nimportant case in point would seem to be the very case of arithmetic\nthat motivated much of the discussion of the analytic in the first\nplace. Recent work of Crispin Wright (1983) and others on the logicist\nprogram has shown how a version of Frege\u2019s program might be\nrescued by appealing not to his problematic Basic Law V, but instead\nmerely to what is called \u201cHume\u2019s Principle,\u201d or the\nclaim that for the number of Fs to be equal to the number\nof Gs is for there to be a \u201cone-to-one\ncorrespondence\u201d between the Fs and the Gs (as in the case of the\nfingers of a normal right and left hand), even in infinite cases.\nAccording to what is now regarded as \u201cFrege\u2019s\nTheorem,\u201d the Peano axioms for arithmetic can be derived from\nthis principle in standard second-order logic (see Frege\u2019s\ntheorem and foundations for arithmetic).\n\nNow, Wright has urged that Hume\u2019s Principle might be regarded as\nanalytic, and perhaps this claim could be sustained by an examination\nof the language faculty along the lines of a Chomskyan linguistics set\nout in the supplement. If so, then wouldn\u2019t that\nvindicate the suggestion that arithmetic can be known a\npriori? Not obviously, since Hume\u2019s Principle is a claim\nnot merely about the concepts F and G, but about the\npresumably concept-independent fact about the number of\nthings that are F and the number of things that are G, and, we can\nask, what justifies any claim about them? As George Boolos (1997)\nasked in response to Wright:\n\n\nIf numbers are supposed to be identical if and only if the concepts\nthey are numbers of are equinumerous, what guarantee do we have that\nevery concept has a number? (p. 253)\n\n\nIndeed, as Edward Zalta (2013) observes,\n\n\nThe basic problem for Frege\u2019s strategy, however, is that for his\nlogicist project to succeed, his system must at some point include\n(either as an axiom or theorem) statements that explicitly assert the\nexistence of certain kinds of abstract entities and it is not obvious\nhow to justify the claim that we know such explicit existential\nstatements. (2013, Section 6.2)\n\n\nThe concept of a unique successor to every number might be a defining\nfeature of the lexical item, \u201cnumber,\u201d but that\ndoesn\u2019t itself imply that an infinity of numbers actually\nexists. Meanings and concepts are one thing; reality quite\nanother. Justification of such existential statements and, with them,\nHume\u2019s Principle would seem to have to involve something more\nthan appealing to merely the concept, but also \u2014to recall\nQuine\u2019s (CLT, p. 121, \u00a73.3 above) claim\u2014 to\n\u201cthe elegance and convenience which the hypothesis brings to the\ncontaining bodies of laws and data,\u201d i.e., to our best overall\nempirical theory of the world, irrespective of what constraints\nlanguage might impose (see Wright, 1999, and Horwich, 2000, for\nfurther discussion).\n\nThe problem here becomes even more obvious in non-mathematical cases.\nFor example, philosophers have wanted to claim not merely that our\nconcepts of red and green exclude the possibility of\nour thinking that something is both colors all over, but that this\npossibility is ruled out for the actual colors,\nred and green,\nthemselves (if such there be). It is therefore no accident that\nBonjour\u2019s (1998, pp. 184\u20135) defense of a priori\nknowledge turns on resuscitating views of Aristotle and Aquinas,\naccording to which the very properties of red and\ngreen themselves are constituents of\nthe propositions we grasp. But it is just such a wonderful coincidence\nbetween merely our concepts and actual worldly\nproperties that a linguistic semantics alone obviously cannot\nensure.\n\nBut suppose, nevertheless, there did in fact exist a\ncorrespondence between our concepts and the world, indeed, a deeply\nreliable, counterfactual-supporting correspondence whereby it was in\nfact metaphysically impossible for certain claims\nconstitutive of those concepts not to be true. This is, of course, not\nimplausible in the case of logic and arithmetic, and is entirely\ncompatible with, e.g., Boolos\u2019 reasonable doubts about them\n(after all, it\u2019s always possible to doubt what is in fact a\nnecessary truth). Such necessary correspondences between thought and\nthe world might then serve as a basis for claims to a priori\nknowledge in at least a reliabilist epistemology, where what\u2019s\nimportant is not believers\u2019 abilities to justify their\nclaims, but merely the reliability of the processes by which\nthey arrive at them (see Reliabilist Epistemology). Indeed,\nin the case of logic and arithmetic, the beliefs might be arrived at\nby steps that were not only necessarily reliable, but might\nalso be taken to be so by believers, in ways that might in fact depend\nin no way upon experience, but only on their competence with the\nrelevant words and concepts (Kitcher 1980; Rey 1998; and Goldman 1999\nexplore this strategy).\n\nSuch a reliabilist approach, though, might be less than fully\nsatisfying to someone interested in the traditional analytic a\npriori. For, although someone might turn out in fact to have\nanalytic a priori knowledge of this sort, she might not\nknow that she does (reliabilist epistemologists standardly\nforgo the \u201cKK Principle,\u201d according to which if one knows\nthat p, one knows that one knows that p). Knowledge that the\nrelevant claims were knowable a priori might itself be only\npossible by an empirically informed understanding of one\u2019s\nlanguage faculty and other cognitive capacities \u00e0 la\nChomsky, and by its consonance with the rest of one\u2019s theory of\nthe world, \u00e0 la Quine. One would only know a\nposteriori that something was knowable a priori.\n\nThe trouble then is that claims that people do have a capacity for\na priori knowledge seem quite precarious. As we noted earlier\n (footnote 7),\n people are often unreliable at appreciating deductively valid\narguments; and appreciating the standard rules even of natural\ndeduction is for many people often a difficult intellectual\nachievement. Consequently, people\u2019s general competence with\nlogical notions may not in fact consist in any grip on valid logical\nrules; and so whatever rules do underlie that competence may well turn\nout not to be the kind of absolutely reliable guide to the\nworld on which the above reliabilist defense of a priori\nanalytic knowledge seems to depend. In any case, in view merely of the\nserious possibility that these pessimistic conclusions are true,\nit\u2019s hard to see how any appeal to the analytic to establish the\ntruth of any controversial claim in any mind-independent domain could\nhave any special justificatory force without a sufficiently detailed,\nempirical psychological theory to back it up.\n\nMoreover, even if we did have a true account of our minds and the\nsemantic rules afforded by our linguistic and conceptual competence,\nit\u2019s not clear it would really serve the \u201carmchair\u201d\npurposes of traditional philosophy that we mentioned at the outset\n(\u00a71). Consider, for example, the common puzzle about the\npossibility that computers might actually think and enjoy a mental\nlife. In response to this puzzle some philosophers, e.g, Wittgenstein\n(1953 [1967], \u00a7\u00a7111, 281), Ziff, 1959, and Hacker, 1990,\nhave suggested that it\u2019s analytic that a thinking thing must be\nalive, a suggestion that certainly seems to accord with many\nfolk intuitions (many people who might cheerfully accept a\ncomputational explanation of a thought process often balk at the\nsuggestion that an inanimate machine engaging in that computation\nwould actually be thinking). Now, as we noted in the\nsupplement, \u00a72, Chomsky (2000, p. 44) explicitly\nendorses this suggestion. So suppose then this claim were in fact\nsustained by linguistic theory, showing that the lexical item\n\u201cthink\u201d is, indeed, constrained by the feature [+animate],\nand so is not felicitously applied to artifactual computers. Should\nthis really satisfy the person worried about the possibility of\nartificial thought?\n\nIt\u2019s hard to see why. For the serious question that concerns\npeople worried about whether artifacts could think concerns whether\nthose artifacts could in fact share the genuine, theoretically\ninteresting, explanatory properties of a thinking thing (cf.\nJackson 1998, pp. 34\u20135). We might have no empirical, scientific\nreason to suppose that genuine, biological animacy (n.b., not\nmerely the perhaps purely syntactic, linguistic feature\n[+animate]!; see supplement \u00a72) actually figures among\nthem. And so we might conclude that, despite these supposed\nconstraints of natural language, inanimate computers could come to\n\u201cthink\u201d after all. Indeed, perhaps, the claim that\nthinking things must be alive is an example of a claim that is\nanalytic but false, rather as the belief that cats are\nanimals would be, should it turn that the things are actually robots\nfrom Mars; and so we should pursue the option of polysemy and\n\u201copen texture\u201d that Chomsky also endorses, and proceed to\nallow that artifacts could think.\n\nOf course, a speaker could choose not to go along with, so to say,\nopening the texture this far. But if the explanatory point were\nnevertheless correct, other speakers could of course simply proceed to\ndefine a new word \u201cthink*\u201d that lacks the animacy\nconstraint and applies to the explanatory kind that in fact turns out\nto include, equally, humans and appropriately programmed artifacts.\nThe issue would reduce to merely a verbal quibble: so computers\ndon\u2019t \u201cthink\u201d; they \u201cthink*\u201d instead.\nIndeed, it\u2019s a peculiar feature of the entire discussion of the\nanalytic that it can seem to turn on what may in the end be mere\nverbal quibbles. Perhaps the \u201clinguist turn\u201d of philosophy\nthat we sketched in \u00a7\u00a71.2\u20133.3 led into a blind alley,\nand it would be more fruitful to explore, so far as possible,\nconceptual and/or explanatory connections that may exist in our minds\nor or in the world to a large extent independently of language.\n\nIn any case, while the semantic conditions of a language might provide\na basis for securing a priori knowledge of claims about\nmind-dependent domains, such as those of perhaps ethics and\naesthetics, in the case of mind-independent domains, such as\nlogic and mathematics, or the nature of worldly phenomena such as life\nor thought, the prospects seem more problematic. There may be analytic\nclaims to be had here, but at least in these cases they would, in the\nimmortal words of Putnam (1965 [1975], p. 36), \u201ccut no\nphilosophical ice\u2026bake no philosophical bread and wash no\nphilosophical\n windows.\u201d[18]\n We would just have to be satisfied with theorizing about the\nmind-independent domains themselves, without being able to justify our\nclaims about them by appeal to the meanings of our words alone.\nReflecting on the difficulties of the past century\u2019s efforts on\nbehalf of the analytic, it\u2019s not clear why anyone would really\nwant to insist otherwise.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Alexander, J. and Weinberg, J., 2007, \u201cAnalytic Epistemology\nand Experimental Philosophy,\u201d <em>Philosophical Compass</em>,\n2(1): 56\u201380.", "Allott, N. and Shaer, B., 2013, \u201cSome Linguistic Properties\nof Legal Notices,\u201d <em>Canadian Journal of Linguistics,\n58</em>(1), 43\u201362.", "Allott, N. and Textor, M., 2017, \u201cLexical Modulation without\nConcepts,\u201d <em>Dialectica</em>, 71(3): 399\u2013424.\ndoi:10.1111/1746-8361.12190", "Alston, W., 1955, \u201cPragmatism and the Verifiability Theory\nof Meaning,\u201d <em>Philosophical Studies</em>, 6(5):\n65\u201371", "Ayer, A.J., 1934 [1952], <em>Language, Truth and Logic</em>, New\nYork: Dover.", "Bealer, G., 1982, <em>Quality and Concept</em>, Oxford: Oxford\nUniversity Press.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1987, \u201cThe Philosophical Limits of\nScientific Essentialism,\u201d in J.
