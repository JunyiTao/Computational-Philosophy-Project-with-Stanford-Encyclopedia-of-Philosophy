    "main_text": "Heterogeneous Naturalism\n5. Heterogeneous Naturalism\n\n\nSo far we have considered three uniform types of methodological naturalism relating\nto mathematics: scientific, mathematical, and\nmathematical-cum-scientific. Consider now a heterogeneous methodological naturalism\nthat accepts mathematical standards when it comes to mathematics proper\nbut adopts scientific standards for the philosophy of mathematics and\nfor philosophy more generally. Heterogeneous naturalism has been\nadvanced by Penelope Maddy (1997), whose rich contributions have\nanimated and incomparably influenced the debate on naturalism in the\nphilosophy of mathematics over the past twenty years. (Maddy now\nprefers to call her naturalism \u2018Second Philosophy\u2019, as in\nthe title of her 2007 book, but here we maintain the label\n\u2018naturalism\u2019 in keeping with the rest of the entry.)\n\n\nTo begin with, a representative quotation from Maddy:\n\n\nWhere Quine holds that science is \u2018not answerable to any\nsupra-scientific tribunal, and not in need of any justification beyond\nobservation and the hypothetico-deductive method\u2019 \u2026, the\nmathematical naturalist adds that mathematics is not answerable to any\nextra-mathematical tribunal and not in need of any justification\nbeyond proof and the axiomatic method (1997, 184).\n\n\nIn our terminology, Maddy's heterogeneous naturalism is a\ntrumping thesis. As she puts it, \u2018if our philosophical account of\nmathematics comes into conflict with successful mathematical practice,\nit is the philosophy that must give\u2019 (1997, 161). Neither philosophy nor science can overturn mathematics' \u2018methodological\nverdicts\u2019 (2007, 361), since they are both extra-mathematical tribunals. However, Maddy takes the philosophy of mathematics as opposed to mathematics\nproper to be a branch of natural science, as she explains in the following passage:\n\n\nSo naturalistic philosophy of mathematics takes place within natural\nscience, like naturalistic philosophy of science, but unlike\nnaturalistic philosophy of science, it takes a hands-off attitude\ntoward the naturalized model of mathematical practice (1997,\n202).\n\n\nThese and similar passages (especially 1997, 200\u2013203) indicate that Maddy takes the philosophy of mathematics to be answerable\nto (natural-) scientific standards.\n\n\nThe distinctiveness of heterogeneous naturalism is thus that it\nrecommends one set of standards (mathematical) for settling some\nquestions about mathematics\u2014mathematical ones, such as which\naxioms to choose\u2014and another set of standards (scientific) for\nsettling other questions about mathematics left open by the practice\nitself\u2014philosophical ones, such as how to interpret mathematics.\nThis is in contrast to uniform naturalisms in the philosophy of\nmathematics, for example Quinean scientific naturalism, or Burgessian\nmathematical-cum-scientific naturalism, or a uniformly mathematical\nnaturalism (also suggested by Maddy (1997) but in our view ultimately not advocated there).\n\n\nTo explain how this bivalent attitude might work in practice, take\nMaddy's favourite example: set theory. Suppose that ZFC + LCA is our\ncurrent accepted set theory, where LCA is some collection of large\ncardinal axioms. Given mathematical naturalism about\nmathematics proper, there is no question of rejecting ZFC + LCA in\nfavour of, say, ZFC + the axiom that there are no inaccessibles, or\nsome other set theory, say Quine's New Foundations. Mathematical\nstandards sanction ZFC + LCA, so that is the set theory we must\naccept. But how should we interpret ZFC + LCA? Platonistically, structurally or in some other way? That is a philosophical question, so given scientific naturalism about the philosophy of mathematics (and philosophy more generally) its correct\nanswer is that sanctioned by scientific standards. For example,\nif an overriding scientific criterion of simplicity favours platonism\nover all other interpretations, that must be the correct\ninterpretation of ZFC+LCA.\n\n\nMaddy motivates her naturalism by appeal to the \u201cfundamental\nspirit that underlies all naturalism: the conviction that a successful\nenterprise, be it science or mathematics, should be understood or\nevaluated on its own terms, that such an enterprise should not be\nsubject to criticism from, and does not stand in need of support from,\nsome external, supposedly higher point of view\u201d (1997, 184).\nOne strained reading of this sentence is that naturalism's fundamental\nconviction by definition applies only to natural science and\nmathematics. A more natural reading is that it applies to any\nsuccessful science whatsoever. Maddy then claims that as a matter of\nfact non-mathematical grounds have not impinged on mathematics. We can\nexpress this as the thesis that mathematics\nis autonomous.\n\n\nThe assessment of Maddy's heterogeneous naturalism consists\nprincipally in the assessment of the autonomy thesis regarding\nmathematics and its implications. One question is whether the thesis is\ntrue. Another is whether, if true, the thesis supports heterogeneous\nnaturalism.\n",
