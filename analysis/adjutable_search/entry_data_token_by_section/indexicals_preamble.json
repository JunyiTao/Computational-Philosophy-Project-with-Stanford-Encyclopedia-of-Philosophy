    "main_text": "\n\n\nAn indexical is, roughly speaking, a linguistic expression whose\nreference can shift from context to context. For example, the\nindexical \u2018you\u2019 may refer to one person in one context and\nto another person in another context. Other paradigmatic examples of\nindexicals are \u2018I\u2019, \u2018here\u2019,\n\u2018today\u2019, \u2018yesterday\u2019, \u2018he\u2019,\n\u2018she\u2019, and \u2018that\u2019. Two speakers who utter a\nsingle sentence that contains an indexical may say different\nthings. For instance, when both John and Mary utter \u2018I am\nhungry\u2019, Mary says that she is hungry, whereas John says that he\nis hungry. Many philosophers hold that indexicals have two sorts of\nmeaning. The first sort of meaning is often called \u2018linguistic\nmeaning\u2019 or \u2018character\u2019 (the latter term is due to\nDavid Kaplan, 1989a). The second sort of meaning is often called\n\u2018content\u2019. Using this terminology, we can say that every\nindexical has a single unvarying character, but may vary in content\nfrom context to context.\n\n\nPhilosophers have several reasons for being interested in\nindexicals. First, some wish to describe their meanings and fit them\ninto a general semantic theory. Second, some wish to understand the\nlogic of arguments containing indexicals, such as Descartes\u2019s\nCogito argument. Third, some think that reflection on\nindexicals may give them some insight into the nature of belief,\nself-knowledge, first-person perspective, consciousness, and other\nimportant philosophical matters.\n",
