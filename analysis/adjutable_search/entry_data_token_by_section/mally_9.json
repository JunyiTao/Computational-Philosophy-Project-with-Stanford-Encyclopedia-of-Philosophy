    "main_text": "Ethics: Norms and Values || Mally on value theory and ethics\n3.3 Mally on value theory and ethics\n\n\nThe lecture notes by Hans Mokre of \u201cErnst Mally: Value Theory\nand Ethics\u201d contain four chapters (many references below refer to\nthe re-typed version in Sagheb-Oehlinger 2008, Appendix,\nwhich will be cited as SOM):\n\nIntroduction: the concept of values; several theories of\nvalue\nPsychology of value: objects of emotions (feelings), types\nof emotions, value feelings and their objects, counter-feelings\n Theory of objects of value, the relationship between\nobjective values and value emotions\n Ethics: morality and values; morally relevant values; ethics\nand the individual person.\n\n3.3.1 Humans possess a natural evidence for values\n\n\nThis is the central ethical hypothesis of Mally: \u201cWhatever has\n(objective) value ought to be\u201d (SOM: 49). Moral values are not values\nfor somebody, but are values of the act of the human person herself. It\nis difficult to see, he maintains, that the moral value of an act does\nnot collapse with the intended utility value of that act. A moral value\nis logically prior to its utility value, because moral values cannot be\nwillingly or consciously intended. Moral values are not assigned to\nobjects of reality but are inherent to them (SOM: 51).\n\n\nIn the tradition of Brentano and Meinong, Mally asserts that moral\nvalues can be perceived emotionally. This conception roots even further\nin the classical tradition of the convergence of being and value from\nAristotle to Leibniz (Mokre 1971: 20): esse et verum et bonum\nconvertuntur. Mally refers to the triad of the true, the good and the\nbeautiful two times in his lecture (SOM: 10; also 44 where he mentions\n\u201cprimary values\u201d in regard to what is true, good and\nbeautiful for which we humans seem to possess a sort of \u201cnatural\nevidence\u201d). But it is questionable to him if a supreme value\nexists at all, like pleasure for Epicurus, lawlike duty for Kant or\nlove for Christians. He rather suggests that the order of moral values\nis infinite\u2014upwards as well as downwards. Since we grasp the\nobjects of reality with our sense perception and then form an\nintellectual judgment, at the same time we experience a particular\nvalue feeling that is our emotional response to the inherent value of\nevery object of reality. For example, when we look at a clock and judge\nthat it is working correctly, then at the same time we experience this\nfact as something positive, pleasant\u2014through our value feeling,\nalthough we don\u2019t perceive anything like \u201cthe pleasure of\nthe clock being in time\u201d. Mally even asserts:\n If an object is valuable\n(wertvoll)\u2014emotionally felt correctly by one\nperson\u2014then it should be valuable to all people. (SOM:\n46)\n3.3.2 Preconditions of moral values are internal and external utility values\n\n\nMally emphasizes again: \u201cEvery value corresponds to an (at\nleast relative) ought\u201d (SOM: 53). The foundation of moral values is\nthe value of life: \u201cAll moral life is connected to the animalist\n\u2018vital sphere\u2019\u201d (SOM: 56). E.g., a small amount of water\nis of particular utility value for the human being to preserve his life\n(15). Particular utility values of this kind are more important than a\ngiven quantity of value institutions like art, legal order, state,\ngovernment or literature. Only through subjective acting on the\nindividual\u2019s part can utility values be created\u2014of course\nwithin the framework of those institutions (SOM: 55). Therefore, Mally\ncontends, there is no such thing as a universal law of morality like\nImmanuel Kant\u2019s Categorical Imperative. The reason for this lies\nin the fact that the individual creates utility values. In the complex\nvariety of life situations, no single rule can cover the total quantity\nof culture, science, religion etc. (SOM: 55).\n\n\nAs internal utility values, Mally lists the value of life, the value\nof consciousness, of conscious activity, of suffering: \u201cTo open\nour eyes for many and even for the highest values, suffering is\nunavoidably necessary\u201d (57); the assertion that the experience of\nsuffering is \u201cunavoidably necessary\u201d for the grasping of\nmoral values has to do with Mally\u2019s own painful and handicapped living\nconditions (see section 1). Furthermore he lists the values of power\nand the value of freedom that is the basic value of all moral acting.\nForeseeing is another precondition because it is necessary for our\nwilling. Finally, we act teleologically (= directed towards a purpose)\nwhich is equally necessary in order to reach a goal.\n\nExternal utility values are natural goods like air, water etc. as\npreconditions for our moral life. The causal order of reality enables\nus to purposeful planning whereas the concrete situation of each act is\nof particular value. Concrete situations make up the whole of moral\nlife. Other external values are power, luck and goods like wealth,\nriches but also social communities like family, society, all of\nhumankind and whatever constitutes them or keeps them together like\nlaw, language, culture, traffic, etc. (SOM: 61)\n3.3.3 Kinds of moral value and the total life value\n\n\nMoral values are categorized by Mally into basic values and values\nof virtue. The most general moral basic value is \u201cthe\ngood\u201d, not meaning \u201cgood for something\u201d or\n\u201cgood for somebody\u201d. \u201cWe signify as good the free\nintention to(wards) objective values\u201d and \u201cevil is the\nintention towards disvalues or the intention against values\u201d\n(SOM: 62). Essential for the moral good is the fact that preferring the\nhigher value is not done through intellectual weighing of alternatives\nbut through our immediate value feeling (SOM: 62). Mally asserts a special\nsense for the varying degree of values\n(\u201cWerth\u00f6hensinn\u201d). This special value sense works in a\nperson\u2019s conscience and makes us immediately feel the right and\nthe wrong behavior. In addition he uses a metaphysical hypothesis that\nhelps building a transition from this subjective value feeling to the\nobjective value:\n\nWhatever is in accordance with the innermost\nessence of reality is objectively valuable and at the same time the\nessence-related most probable. (SOM: 62) \n\nThe latter is not\nnecessarily the empirically most probable, i.e., not what probably will\nbe realized in the individual case but what ought to be realized (or\nwhat is worthy to be realized). Objective values are an a priori given\nessence relatedness in our value feeling (SOM: 63).\n\nThe values\nthemselves are ideal forms (Gebilde) which exist timelessly and\nunchangeably. (SOM: 74)\n\n Yet the value behavior of humans following\nthem is changing, mainly because it loses the immediate emotional\ncontact (feeling) to the values. Instead of this immediate value\nfeeling and its ensuing insight humans accept the value tradition of\nsociety. Moreover, Mally talks about \u201cvalue forms\u201d\n(Wertgestalten) which can be seen as ideal types of personality (SOM: 75).\nOne of the many value forms (depending on value perspectives and value\nhierarchies) corresponds to each individual human being: in her\nempirical character we find the ethical norm of her value form. This\nethical norm occurs in that character as essence-directed tendency\ntowards the value form. Mally adds that this assertion corresponds to\nthe above mentioned metaphysical hypothesis \u201cthat only the\nobjectively valuable exists in the essence of reality\u201d (SOM: 76). The\nmoral task of each individual consists in the fulfillment of his\npersonal ethical norm. The way to find that norm will be shown to him\nby his conscience.\n\n\nIn other words: to Mally, the concept of a subjective value\nconstituted by the feeling or willing of the individual is untenable.\nRather, in her feeling and understanding the person corresponds to\nvarious objective values in reality. With her willing, she responds to\nthe ought that is dwelling in the objects of reality. Karl Wolf\nsummarizes Mally\u2019s central point:\n\nIn her feeling the human\nbeing responds adequately to various value qualities of reality; in her\nwilling she corresponds to the ought that is contained in the\n\u2018objects\u2019. (Wolf 1971: 12, translation by the\nauthors)\n\nThe problem of different value experiences by different\npeople is explained by Mally with the hierarchy of ranks of\nperspectives. Each concrete situation conveys an objective value as\nwell as a value perspective of that particular reality to the person\n(see the reflection of this view in Mally\u2019s deontic logic in the\nnext paragraph). Since each situation is different depending on the\ntemperament, the mood, the age, etc. of the beholder, as well as the\nzeitgeist reflected by him, each result of such a personal situation\nexperience is genuine, i.e., indubitable. This is the reason why there\ncannot be a general moral norm to act in certain situations in a\ncertain moral way (SOM: 76). Yet there is a hierarchy of experienced\nperspectives. Some are better because they make more distinctions, some\nare worse because the particular feeling experience is not adequately\ncorresponding to the situation. The main tendency of a person\u2019s\nstriving should be towards the total value of the life of that person\n(SOM: 49). Moral behavior that supports a striving towards this total value\nis better than the pursuit of other strivings that miss this total\nvalue (Wolf 1971: 12\u201313).\n\n\nAt this point, a short remark about the consequences of Mally\u2019s value\ntheory in regard to his deontic logic seems to be in order. His\ndeontic axiom III is seen at least as \u201cproblematic\u201d by all\nknown critics so far. This axiom states the equivalence of the factual\nwith the obligatory. This has been judged as problematic or even\nabsurd because in modern meta-ethical discourse the is-ought gap is\naccepted as logical basis for all ethical deliberations, and,\nmoreover, the collapse would mean that our actual world is a morally\n\u201cideal\u201d one. Mally, however, broadens this view. To him,\nthe ought is contained in the objects of reality. With\n\u2018objects\u2019 he does not refer to sensually perceived\nentities but to the more complex essence of objects (on Meinong\u2019s\nobject-theoretic basis). According to Meinong\u2019s view on dignitatives\n(an expression not used by Mally, who refers to them as\n\u201cForderungen\u201d in Mally 1926: 12, or Mally 1971:\n243), a value constitutes an object of higher order. This value is\ncomplex and can only emotionally be grasped but it cannot be defined,\nnor even propositionally characterized. E.g., a donation to a\ncharitable fund can be understood or felt as a morally good deed\n(Marek 2008: ch. 6.2).  Although this would not be a sensory\nperception of an object, to Mally it is the emotional impression or\nfeeling that reveals the \u201cessence of the object\u201d\nconsidered. It is interesting to note that Mally must have been aware\nof some of the criticisms of his controversial axiom III (by Laird\n1926 or Menger 1939), but it is not known if he ever defended it or at\nleast tried to clarify his underlying value theoretical viewpoint.\n3.3.4 Trends in Mally\u2019s ethics after 1926/27\n\n\nAlthough Mally denies the possibility of a universal moral principle\n(Mally 1935: 75), he emphasizes the important role of our moral\nresponsibility. Our responsibility must be exemplified through moral\ndecisions: \u201cMorality is always the striving after the most\nperfect meaning and its best exemplification\u201d (Mally 1935: 77).\nThere is, however, a formal moral duty, \u201cFollow your\nconscience\u201d, or more precisely, \u201cAct in the way that you\nrecognize as right according to the best of your knowledge and\nconscience\u201d (Mally 1938a: 27).\n\n\nUltimately, morality is connected with the divine. For the\nreligiously inspired person, morality is a matter of religion, because\nreligion is necessarily linked to morality. For the philosophically\noriented person, morality is the supreme task of her character to\ntranscend her ego. This striving beyond one\u2019s own person is again\na kind of meaning exemplification of the dynamic structure of reality.\nAs a sort of moral behavior, it is always related to fellow humans.\nDoing the right thing is not only a private matter for oneself and\none\u2019s neighbors. No human belongs to himself or to some other\npeople next to him. He belongs to everyone, foremost to the community,\nMally asserts, and to the reality of the world: \u201cThe world is\nbeautiful in him, just like a tree blossoms in each of its\nflowers\u201d (Mally 1935: 77). Pursuing this responsibility makes the\nperson a microcosmos, an image of a deity (Gottheit). And:\n\nthe\nmost original feature of a human being and her deepest personality\nmagically shine through in the case of love, a loved person is always\nexperienced as a miracle. (Mally 1935: 62)\n\n\nMally\u2019s dynamistic-holistic world-view with its central notion\nof strivings (Strebungen) has further been developed and applied to a\nnumber of moral issues by his student Karl Wolf (1947). In chapter 11\nof Realistic Ethics, Wolf asserts,\n\nEvery tendency is basically\ngood when it remains within the order of the whole, and every tendency,\neven the most ideal, becomes evil, when it transgresses the\norder. (Wolf 1947: 78)\n\nThus, a balance is morally required with\na view to the dynamic order of the whole. Compromise as a rule of\nnature justifies the power of the stronger, because the stronger is\nmore capable of guaranteeing a balance in conflicts than the weaker.\nThis idea is also applicable to education: the stronger parent helps\nthe weaker child, thereby creating a balance within the whole of\nstrivings of both people involved. More detailed discussions by Wolf\nare elaborated in the collection of his essays (Rothbucher/Zecha\n2012).\n4. Philosophy and National Socialist Ideology\n\n\nAfter the end of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy 1918, Mally became a\nmember of the Gro\u00dfdeutsche Volkspartei, a German\nnational and mostly anti-semitic party in the Austrian parliament,\nwhich agitated, like Sch\u00f6nerer and his followers, for Austria\u2019s\nannexation to Germany. In February 1938, Mally joined\nthe Volkspolitisches Referat, an organisation with the goal\nto unite all Austrian nationalist movements (including the National\nSocialists). The same year he also entered the NS Lehrerbund\n(National Socialist Teachers\u2019 Association).  Two months after the\nannexation of Austria by Germany in March 1938, Mally became a member\nof the NSDAP (National Socialist German Workers Party), i.e., the Nazi\nparty. Given all this political involvement in Austria\u2019s and later\nGermany\u2019s national movements, the question has been legitimately\nraised whether and how his political attitude influenced his\nphilosophical work. It seems to be appropriate to pursue this question\nand some answers to it in its historical development.\n\n\nFirst, it is interesting how the Nazis themselves classified Mally\u2019s\nphilosophical work with respect to their ideology.  According to their\njudgment of the political reliability of philosophy professors in\nGermany (then including Austria) by the\nReichssicherheitsdienst of the Reichsf\u00fchrer SS,\nthere were six groups:\n\n\nDenominationally bound philosophers;\nLiberal philosophers; \nIndifferent philosophers; \nPolitically positive philosophers; \nNational Socialist philosophers;\nPositive junior scholars (Nachwuchskr\u00e4fte).\n\n(Korotin 2007: 8; translation by the authors)\n\n\nMally was ranked in group 2 and thus categorized as\n\u201cliberal\u201d, which here meant \u201cneither national\nsocialist nor system dependent\u201d according to Korotin (2007:\n8). The term \u2018liberal\u2019 was used by the Nazis for German\nnationalists who were not considered to be National Socialists.\n\n\nSecond, after World War II, no one seemed to have serious concerns\nabout Mally\u2019s philosophical work (or even just parts of it) in view of\nhis political attitude. In 1971, a collection of essays (including\nGro\u00dfes Logikfragment and Grundgesetze des\nSollens) was edited by Karl Wolf and Paul Weingartner, with\nintroductory comments by the editors as well as by Hans Mokre. It was\nonly in the 1990s when a critical and serious discussion of the\nquestion how Mally\u2019s political views influenced his philosophical work\nbegan.\n\n\nThird, Sauer 1998 claimed that Mally\u2019s National Socialist views\nclearly shaped his philosophical writings. Sauer provides a number of\nquotes from, and references to, Mally\u2019s writings and private\ncorrespondence, as well as a critical evaluation. He condemns Mally\u2019s\nentire later philosophical work as not being worthy of any further\ninvestigation. Thus Sauer challenged the philosophical community to\nseriously investigate all of Mally\u2019s work, including some of his\nunpublished manuscripts and personal correspondence. Sch\u00f6nafinger 1994\ncomes to similar results, based on previously unpublished work by\nSauer and referencing to personal documents and lecture notes in the\narchives of the Graz University Library. In 2008, Sagheb-Oehlinger\ndevoted her entire master\u2019s thesis to this problem. She analyzed\nthoroughly all \u201clater\u201d philosophical writings of Mally by\nproviding ten categories like racism, anti-semitism, cult of\nthe F\u00fchrer, anti-democratic, National Socialist education,\netc. In addition she studied Mally\u2019s private correspondence with his\nphilosophical \u201csoulmate\u201d and pen friend, Gertraud Laurin,\nwhich extended over a period of ten years\n(1934\u20131944). Sagheb-Oehlinger\u2019s final result can be summed up\nthe following way: Mally cannot clearly be seen a \u201cNational\nSocialist philosopher\u201d, but there is no doubt about the national\nsocialist ideological content of his Anfangsgr\u00fcnde der\nPhilosophie (1938a) (Sagheb-Oehlinger 2008: 143). This is\ndifferent from what Sauer (1998) had concluded. To give just one\nexample, in his description of Anfangsgr\u00fcnde der Philosophie\n(Mally 1938a) Sauer names the two National Socialist main values\nemphasized in Mally\u2019s book, the \u201cbasic value of blood\u201d and\nthe \u201cduty to keep the race clean and breed it higher\u201d\n(Sauer 1998: 184). He then continues:\n\nWith one brief word, the\nphilosophical placet is granted to the whole barbaric madness of the\nracist legislation and racist separation, of the legislation of\nhereditary health and the forced sterilization in huge numbers of\ninsane people (or what was identified as such) and social\nnonconformists. (Sauer 1998: 184)\n\n Whilst it is correct that Mally (in\nMally 1938a) certainly supported this ideology that led to these\natrocities, Sauer\u2019s general conclusion that all of Mally\u2019s late\nphilosophy stands in one row with the works of all the other Nazi\nphilosophers is questionable. Also his concluding question whether\nthere remains anything of Mally\u2019s philosophy worth to be saved finds\nits positive answer in the preceding sections. For more details see the\nfollowing paragraphs.\n\n\nFinally, considering these opposing views, we want to give our own\nadditional assessment of Mally\u2019s philosophical writings with respect to\nhis national socialist involvement. Though Mally was an analytic,\nscientifically oriented philosopher who produced original contributions\nin various fields of philosophy, it is a fact that National Socialist\nideas and principles inspired some of his later philosophical works. He\npresents us with a case where, in certain parts of his work, it is not\neasy to separate his private political convictions from the content.\nNevertheless, it is important to stress that many of Mally\u2019s works are\nfree from any untoward political influences, and their philosophical\nvalue should in no way be diminished by his political views. But, of\ncourse, there are works that do contain National Socialist ideology. We\nwill outline the grades of National Socialist involvement in Mally\u2019s\nwork below, but first we present a short sketch of Mally\u2019s central\nNationalist Socialist (NS) theses.\n\n\nIn NS ideology, the concept of das Volk (the people),\nespecially das deutsche Volk (the German people), plays a\ncentral role. From the early 1930s on, Mally tried to provide a\nphilosophical justification for the value judgments (1) that das\nVolk is more important than its individual members, and (2) that\nthe Germans constitute the dominant people. He further stated an\nanti-reduction thesis, namely, that the concept of das Volk\ncannot be reduced to the concepts of each of its members (the\nindividual persons). He thus wanted to\n\n\u201cfight against\nsubjectivist, Jewish-positivist and related doctrines \u2026 and\nreplace them by something healthier\u201d. (From Mally\u2019s curriculum\nvit\u00e6, dated September 23, 1938, six months after the Anschluss;\nunpublished, University of Graz Library/Nachlass-Sammlung. This is,\nhowever, not a philosophical work but can rather be seen as an\nopportunistic self-description).\n\nThis fact also explains why Mally saw himself in opposition to the\nVienna Circle and the logical positivists, who he thought of as being\nthe prime exponents of the \u201cindividualist\nideology\u201d\u2014an ideology which (according to Mally) tries to\ndeprive the world of its meaning (Sinn).  Mally saw das\nVolk as a \u201cquasi-person\u201d, having a body, a mind, and\na soul; das Volk cannot be completely rationally\ncomprehended, it rather has to be experienced (erlebt). He\nmaintains that the \u201cessential reality\u201d of das\nVolk is revealed through this experience, i.e., its meaning, and\nthus, the meaning of its \u201cdynamic development\u201d is\nrevealed. Furthermore, different V\u00f6lker (peoples) have\ndifferent properties, depending on their origin, their development,\nculture, etc. These properties allegedly yield a significantly moral\ndifference: the German people are supposed to rank among the peoples\nwith the highest value and have therefore to be kept\n\u201cpure\u201d. External influences have to be eliminated, so that\ndas deutsche Volk can be \u201cbred\u201d to even higher\nstates of development, and thus gradually strive towards a state where\nits meaning can be totally fulfilled (see Mally 1934b, 1935 and\n1938a).\n From any reasonable perspective today, all his NS\n\u201ctheses\u201d are either barely understandable, or simply\nfalse.  Obviously, his allegations reflect Nazi ideology. In any case,\nmuch of what we find in the writings just described has nothing to do\nwith serious and solid philosophy. If we summarize the NS involvement\nin Mally\u2019s writings between 1904 and 1944, we may distinguish three\ndifferent grades, not in chronological order. Grade 1 is\n\u201cNS-ideology free\u201d. These are purely philosophical\nwritings such as Mally 1904, 1912, 1923, 1926, and 1938b.  In grade 2,\nwe count philosophical writings partially interpretable by, and\napplicable to, Nazi ideology, such as Mally 1935 and 1940.  Finally,\nwe can count as grade 3 the pure Nazi propaganda in articles or\npamphlets such as Mally 1934b and 1938a. For an assessment of Mally\u2019s\nphilosophical involvement in NS-ideology, see also Roschitz 2016b,\nch.7, 143\u2013157.\n\n\nAs we have shown above, Mally\u2019s logical as well as ontological\nideas, concepts and theories are still being discussed in contemporary\nphilosophical research. His value theory and ethical philosophy,\nhowever, are largely unknown and deserve widespread attention as his\nviews are diametrically opposed to what is generally accepted today.\nMoreover, this short overview should make clear that there are many\nparts in Mally\u2019s writings that deserve serious further philosophical\ninvestigation.",
