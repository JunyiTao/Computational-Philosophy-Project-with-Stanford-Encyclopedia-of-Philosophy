    "main_text": "Associational Privacy\n3. Associational Privacy\n\nRespect for the intimacy of the experiences of suffering, childbirth,\nrecovery and dying is required by sound ethics. People who are in pain\nor grieving have an interest in including some people and excluding\nothers. People commonly want to reserve sharing the joys of medical\nexperience with friends and family, no less than the agonies. They\nhave what can be thought of as an associational privacy interest in\nselective intimacy.\n\nInjured, suffering, and dying adults may badly desire intimacy, even\nsexual intimacy. A patient may wish to exclude strangers or\ninessential medical personnel at times when the presence of loved ones\nis welcome. Parents of newborns may regard strangers photographing\ntheir babies as violations of family intimacy. A dying man may object\nto being photographed by a physician anxious to take photographs of\nthe man\u2019s surgical wounds for scientific purposes. If\nassociational privacy is important, a bored visitor strolling the\nhalls of a hospital should not maneuver to watch a randomly selected\npatient give birth; and if he does, he merits criticism as a morally\noffensive intruder.\n\nHospitals and hospital patients have clashed over who should be\nallowed visitation and a role in decision-making or hands-on care.\nSome institutions have kept extended family, paramours, gay or lesbian\npartners and children away from in-patients. On the other hand,\nchildren\u2019s hospitals commonly encourage parents to spend as much\ntime as possible with sick minors, and may have sleeping sofas near\nchildren\u2019s beds or sleeping rooms inside the hospital for\nattentive guardians.\n",
