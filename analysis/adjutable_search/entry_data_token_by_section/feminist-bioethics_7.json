    "main_text": "Feminist Approaches to Bioethical Analysis || Importance of the body and embodiment\n3.3 Importance of the body and embodiment\n\nWomen\u2019s lives are shaped by the materiality of having/being a\nbody that deviates from the male norm. Feminist theory recognizes the\npolitical and moral importance of the body, and part of feminist\nbioethics\u2019 central criticism of mainstream bioethics is that as\nwell as being abstract and decontextualized, it also reflects a\ndisembodied view of moral life. This in turn creates an obliviousness\nto the moral significance of embodied particularity. Medical science\nhas a long history of dismissing the female body as\n\u201canomalous\u201d, and because it also tends to equate anomaly\nwith pathology, it has an equally long history of pathologizing\nwomen\u2019s bodies. Early feminist bioethicists, including Susan\nBordo (1993) and Mary Mahowald (1993), published work examining\nmedical and cultural attitudes toward women\u2019s bodies.\nSubsequently, an influential strand of work within feminist bioethics\nhas moved from the moral consideration of the normatively sexed\nand gendered body to reflecting more generally on what is means\nto have/be an anomalous body, including raced and disabled bodies,\nintersex bodies, or bodies that are of nonstandard shape or size\n(Reiheld 2015; Dolezal 2015; MacKay 2017). Some of the most\ninteresting work in this area takes a phenomenological approach to the\nexperiences of pregnancy, lesbian or transgender embodiment, and\ndisability or illness. Susan Wendell\u2019s The Rejected\nBody (1996) was an early instance of a large body of feminist\nbioethical writing that relates to disability.\n",
