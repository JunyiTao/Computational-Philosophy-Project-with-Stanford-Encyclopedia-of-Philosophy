    "main_text": "Information Processing Using Statistical Mechanics || Phenomenological proofs\n4.3 Phenomenological proofs\n\n\nGroisman, Ladyman, Short and Presnell (2007) presented a\nphenomenological argument in favour of the proposition that all\nlogically irreversible operations are thermodynamically irreversible.\nIn this they were responding in part to Norton's (2005) criticism of\nthe generality of previous proofs of Landauer's principle (including\nPiechocinska's) and in part to Maroney's (2005) argument that the\nequality in Piechocinska's proof is reachable, and when reached the\nheat is generated in a thermodynamically reversible fashion.\n\n\nTheir intention seems to have been to have a general proof that can\nbe shown to hold independently of any particular model of physical\nprocess of resetting. To achieve this without presuming something about\nthe physics which governs a device that performs the resetting, they\nexplicitly accepted the sound approach to Earman and Norton's Sound vs.\nProfound dilemma. This means they assumed that a particular modified\nform of the second law of thermodynamics must hold true. The modified\nversion that they adopted is that there are no cyclic processes, whose\nsole result is to restore a system to its initial state and having a\nstrictly positive expectation value for the conversion of heat into\nwork.\n\n\nTheir method was, in essence, equivalent to that of Szilard and\nBennett. They considered the operation of the Szilard engine, using a\ndevice to measure and store the location of the molecule, and a\ncorrelated operation to extract heat from it. Then they reset the\ndevice. Unlike Bennett, they did not assume that resetting has a cost,\nand argue that this cost saves the second law. Rather, like Szilard,\nthey imposed a modified form of the second law, and from it deduced\nthat resetting has a cost. The generality of their claim is based upon\nthe fact that they made no attempt to characterise the device\nphysically, although they did assume it was capable of performing\nnon-dissipative measurements.\n",
