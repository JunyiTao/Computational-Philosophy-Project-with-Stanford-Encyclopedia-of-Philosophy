    "preamble": "\n\nEpistemic logic is a subfield of philosophical logic concerned with\nlogical approaches to knowledge, belief, and related notions. Though\nany logic with an epistemic interpretation may be called an\nepistemic logic, the most widespread type of epistemic logics\nin use at present are modal logics. Knowledge and belief are\nrepresented via the modal operators K and B, often with\na subscript indicating the agent that holds the attitude.

Epistemic logic allows the formal\nexploration of the implications of epistemic principles. For example,\nthe formula \\(K_{a}\\varphi\\rightarrow\\varphi\\) states that what is\nknown is true, while \\(K_{a}\\varphi\\rightarrow K_{a}K_{a}\\varphi\\)\nstates that what is known is known to be known.

    "main_text": "\n1. Introduction\n\nAristotelian texts set the groundwork for discussions of the logic of\nknowledge and belief, particularly De Sophisiticis Elenchis\nas well as the Prior and Posterior Analytics. While\nAristotle addressed the four alethic modes of possibility, necessity,\nimpossibility, and contingency, Buridan, Pseudo Scotus, Ockham, and\nRalph Strode, helped to extend Aristotle\u2019s insights to epistemic\nthemes and problems (Boh 1993; Knuuttila 1993). During this period,\nPseudo Scotus and William of Ockham supplemented Aristotle\u2019s\nstudy of mental acts of cognition and volition (see Boh 1993: 130).\nIvan Boh\u2019s studies of the history of fourteenth and fifteenth\ncentury investigations into epistemic logic provide an excellent\ncoverage of the topic, especially his Epistemic Logic in the Later\nMiddle Ages (1993).\n\nAccording to Boh, the English philosopher Ralph Strode formulated a\nfully general system of propositional epistemic rules in his\ninfluential 1387 book Consequences (Boh 1993: 135).\nStrode\u2019s presentation built on the earlier logical treatises of\nOckham and Burley. Problems of epistemic logic were also discussed\nbetween the 1330s and 1360s by the so-called Oxford Calculators, most\nprominently by William Heytesbury and Richard Kilvington. By the\nfifteenth century, Paul of Venice and other Italian philosophers also\nengaged in sophisticated reflection on the relationship between\nknowledge, truth, and ontology.\n\nDiscussions of epistemic logic during the medieval period share a\nsimilar set of foundational assumptions with contemporary discussions.\nMost importantly, medieval philosophers explored the connection\nbetween knowledge and veracity: If I know p, then p is\ntrue. Furthermore, many medieval discussions begin with an assumption\nsimilar to G.E. Moore\u2019s observation that an epistemic agent\ncannot coherently assert \u201cp but I do not believe (know)\np\u201d. Sentences of this form are generally referred to as\nMoore sentences.\n\nModern treatments of the logic of knowledge and belief grew out of the\nwork of philosophers and logicians writing from 1948 through the\n1950s. Rudolf Carnap, Jerzy \u0141o\u015b, Arthur Prior, Nicholas\nRescher, G.H. von Wright, and others recognized that our discourse\nconcerning knowledge and belief admits of an axiomatic-deductive\ntreatment. Among the many important papers that appeared in the 1950s,\nvon Wright\u2019s seminal work (1951) is widely acknowledged as\nhaving initiated the formal study of epistemic logic as we know it\ntoday. Von Wright\u2019s insights were extended by Jaakko Hintikka in\nhis book Knowledge and Belief: An Introduction to the Logic of the\nTwo Notions (1962). Hintikka provided a way of interpreting\nepistemic concepts in terms of possible world semantics and as such it\nhas served as the foundational text for the study of epistemic logic\never since.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, epistemic logicians focused on the logical\nproperties of systems containing groups of knowers and later still on\nthe epistemic features of so-called \u201cmulti-modal\u201d\ncontexts. Since the 1990s work in\n dynamic epistemic logic\n has extended traditional epistemic logic by modeling the dynamic\nprocess of knowledge acquisition and belief revision. In the past two\ndecades, epistemic logic has come to comprise a broad set of formal\napproaches to the interdisciplinary study of knowledge and belief.\n\nInterest in epistemic logic extends well beyond philosophers. Recent\ndecades have seen a great deal of interdisciplinary attention to\nepistemic logic with economists and computer scientists actively\ndeveloping the field together with logicians and philosophers. In 1995\ntwo important books signaled the fertile interplay between computer\nscience and epistemic logic: Fagin, Halpern, Moses, and Vardi (1995)\nand Meyer and van der Hoek (1995). Work by computer scientists has\nbecome increasingly central to epistemic logic in the intervening\nyears.\n\nAmong philosophers, there is increased attention to the interplay\nbetween these formal approaches and traditional epistemological\nproblems (see for example, van Benthem 2006; Hendricks & Symons\n2006; Stalnaker 2006; Artemov 2008; Holliday 2018; Baltag,\nBezhanishvili, et al. 2019).\n\nSeveral introductory texts on epistemic logic exist, e.g., Fagin et\nal. (1995), van Benthem (2011); van Ditmarsch, van der Hoek, and Kooi\n(2007); van Ditmarsch, Halpern, et al. (2015); Gochet and Gribomont\n(2006); and Meyer (2001) with Lenzen (1980) providing an overview of\nearly developments.\n2. The Modal Approach to Knowledge\n\nUntil relatively recently, epistemic logic focused almost exclusively\non propositional knowledge. In cases of propositional knowledge, an\nagent or a group of agents bears the propositional attitude of knowing\ntowards some proposition. For example, when one says: \u201cZoe knows\nthat there is a hen in the yard\u201d, one asserts that Zoe is the\nagent who bears the propositional attitude knowing towards\nthe proposition expressed by the English sentence \u201cthere is a\nhen in the yard\u201d. Now imagine that Zoe does not know whether\nthere is a hen in the yard. For example, it might be the case that she\nhas no access to information about whether there is or is not a hen in\nthe yard. In this case her lack of information means that she will\nconsider two scenarios as being possible, one in which there is a hen\nin the yard and one in which there is not.\n\nPerhaps she has some practical decision that involves not only hens\nbut also the presence of frightening dogs in the yard. She might wish\nto feed the hens but will only do so if there is no dog in the yard.\nIf she were ignorant of whether there is a dog in the yard, the number\nof scenarios she must consider in her deliberations grows to four.\nClearly, one needs to consider epistemic alternatives when one does\nnot have complete information concerning the situations that are\nrelevant to one\u2019s decisions. As we shall see below, possible\nworlds semantics has provided a useful framework for understanding the\nmanner in which agents can reason about epistemic alternatives.\n\nWhile epistemic logicians had traditionally focused on knowing\nthat, one finds a range of other uses of knowledge in natural\nlanguage. As Y. Wang (2018b) points out, the expressions knowing\nhow, knowing what, knowing why are very common,\nappearing almost just as frequently (sometimes more frequently) in\nspoken and written language as knowing that. Recently\nnon-standard epistemic logics of such know-wh expressions have been\ndeveloped, to which we will come back in\n Section 4.\n In the remainder of this section, we will introduce the basics of the\nepistemic logic of knowing that.\n2.1 The Formal Language of Epistemic Logic\n\nRecent work in epistemic logic relies on a modal conception of\nknowledge. In order to be clear about the role of modality in\nepistemic logic it is helpful to introduce the basic elements of the\nmodern formalism. For the sake of simplicity we begin with the case of\nknowledge and belief for a single agent, postponing consideration of\nmultiple agents to\n Section 3,\n\nA prototypical epistemic logic language is given by first fixing a set\nof propositional variables \\(p_{1}\\), \\(p_{2}\\),\u2026. In\napplications of epistemic logic, propositional variables are given\nspecific interpretations: For example, \\(p_{1}\\) could be taken to\nrepresent the proposition \u201cthere is a hen in the yard\u201d and\n\\(p_{2}\\) the proposition \u201cthere is a dog in the yard\u201d,\netc. The propositional variables represent propositions which are\nrepresented in no finer detail in the formal language. As such, they\nare therefore often referred to as atomic propositions or\nsimply atoms. Let Atom denote the set of atomic\npropositions.\n\nApart from the atomic propositions, epistemic logic supplements the\nlanguage of propositional logic with a modal operator, \\(K_{a}\\), for\nknowledge and \\(B_{a}\\), for belief.\n\n\n\\(K_{a}\\varphi\\) reads \u201cAgent a knows that\n\\(\\varphi\\)\u201d\n\n\nand similarly\n\n\n\\(B_{a}\\varphi\\) reads \u201cAgent a believes that\n\\(\\varphi\\)\u201d.\n\n\nIn many recent publications on epistemic logic, the full set of\nformulas in the language is given using a so-called Backus-Naur\nForm (BNF). This is simply a notational technique derived from\ncomputer science that provides a recursive definition of the formulas\ndeemed grammatically \u201ccorrect\u201d, i.e., the set of\nwell-formed formulas: \n\\[\\varphi::=p \\mid \\neg\\varphi\\mid (\\varphi\\wedge\\varphi)\\mid K_{a}\\varphi\\mid B_{a}\\varphi,\\text{ for } p\\in\\Atom.\\]\n\n\nIt should be noted that the Greek letter \\(\\varphi\\) stands for the\nsyntactic category of formula. So this definition says: an\natom p is a formula; \\(\\neg\\varphi\\) is a formula if\n\\(\\varphi\\) is a formula (read \\(\\neg\\) as \u2018it is not the case\nthat\u2019); \\((\\varphi\\wedge\\varphi)\\) is a formula whenever any two\nformulas are connected by the \\(\\wedge\\) symbol (read \\(\\wedge\\) as\n\u2018and\u2019); and \\(K_{a}\\varphi\\) and \\(B_{a}\\varphi\\) are\nformulas whenever \\(\\varphi\\) is a formula (the readings were\nindicated above). Note that in a non-BNF recursive specification of\nthe language, the Greek variable \\(\\varphi\\) would be used a\nmetavariable ranging over formulas, and one would normally\nstate the clause for conjunctions as: \\((\\varphi \\wedge \\psi)\\) is a\nformula whenever \\(\\varphi\\) and \\(\\psi\\) are formulas. But the BNF\nlet\u2019s us get away with just using \\(\\varphi\\) to get the same\neffect.\n\nWe will call this basic language that includes both a Knowledge\nand a Belief operator, \\(\\mathcal{L}_{KB}\\). As in\npropositional logic, additional connectives are defined from \\(\\neg\\)\nand \\(\\wedge\\): Typical notation is \u2018\\(\\vee\\)\u2019 for\n\u2018or\u2019, \u2018\\(\\rightarrow\\)\u2019 for \u2018if\u2026,\nthen \u2026\u2019 and \u2018\\(\\leftrightarrow\\)\u2019 for\n\u2018\u2026 if, and only if, \u2026\u2019. Also typically\n\\(\\top\\) (\u2018top\u2019) and \\(\\bot\\) (\u2018bottom\u2019) is\nused to denote the constantly true proposition and the constantly\nfalse proposition, respectively.\n\nAs we shall see below, \\(K_{a}\\varphi\\) is read as stating that\n\\(\\varphi\\) holds in all of the worlds accessible to\na. In this sense, K can be regarded as behaving\nsimilarly to the \u2018box\u2019 operator, \\(\\square\\), often used\nto denote necessity. In evaluating \\(K_{a}\\varphi\\) at a possible\nworld w, one is in effect evaluating a universal\nquantification over all the worlds accessible from w. The\nuniversal quantifier \\(\\forall\\) in first-order logic has the\nexistential quantifier \\(\\exists\\) as its dual: This means\nthat the quantifiers are mutually definable by taking either\n\\(\\forall\\) as primitive and defining \\(\\exists x\\varphi\\) as short\nfor \\(\\neg\\forall x\\neg\\varphi\\) or by taking \\(\\exists\\) as primitive\nand defining \\(\\forall x\\varphi\\) as \\(\\neg\\exists x\\neg\\varphi\\). In\nthe case of \\(K_{a}\\), it may be seen that the formula \\(\\neg\nK_{a}\\neg\\varphi\\) makes an existential quantification: It\nsays that there exists an accessible world that satisfies\n\\(\\varphi\\). In the literature, a dual operator for \\(K_{a}\\) is often\nintroduced. The typical notation for \\(\\neg K_{a}\\neg\\) includes\n\\(\\langle K_{a}\\rangle\\) and \\(\\widehat{K}_{a}\\). This notation mimics\nthe diamond-shape \\(\\lozenge\\), which is the standard dual operator to\nthe box \\(\\square\\), which in turn is standard notation for the\nuniversally quantifying modal operator (see the entry on\n modal logic).\n\nMore expressive languages in epistemic logic involve the addition of\noperators for various notions of group knowledge (see\n Section 3).\n For example, as we discuss below, the common knowledge\noperator and so-called dynamic operators are important\nadditions to the language of epistemic logic. Dynamic operators can\nindicate for example the truthful public announcement of\n\\(\\varphi\\): \\([\\varphi!]\\). A formula \\([\\varphi!]\\psi\\) is read\n\u201cif \\(\\varphi\\) is truthfully announced to everybody, then after\nthe announcement, \\(\\psi\\) is the case\u201d. The question of what\nkinds of expressive power is added with the addition of operators is a\nresearch topic that is actively being investigated in\n dynamic epistemic logic.\n So, for example, adding \\([\\varphi!]\\) by itself to\n\\(\\mathcal{L}_{KB}\\) does not add expressive power, but in a\nlanguage that also includes common knowledge, it does (e.g., van\nDitmarsch, van der Hoek, & Kooi 2007).\n2.2 Higher-Order Attitudes\n\nNotice that, for example, \\(K_{a}K_{a}p\\) is a formula in the language\nwe introduced above. It states that agent a knows that agent\na knows that p is the case. Formula with nested\nepistemic operators of this kind express a higher-order\nattitude: an attitude concerning the the attitude of some agent.\n\nHigher-order attitudes is a recurring theme in epistemic logic. The\naforementioned Moore sentences, e.g., \\(B_{a}(p\\wedge B_{a}\\neg p)\\)\nexpress a higher-order attitude. So do many of the epistemic\nprinciples discussed in the literature and below. Consider the\nfollowing prominent epistemic principle involving higher-order\nknowledge: \\(K_{a}\\varphi\\rightarrow K_{a}K_{a}\\varphi\\). Is it\nreasonable to require that knowledge satisfies this scheme, i.e., that\nif somebody knows \\(\\varphi\\), then they know that they know\n\\(\\varphi\\)? In part, we might hesitate before accepting this\nprinciple in virtue of the higher-order attitude involved. This is a\nmatter of ongoing discussion in epistemic logic and epistemology.\n2.3 The Partition Principle and Modal Semantics\n\nThe semantics of the formal language introduced above is generally\npresented in terms of so-called possible worlds. In epistemic logic\npossible worlds are interpreted as epistemic alternatives. Hintikka\nwas the first to explicitly articulate such an approach (1962). This\nis another central feature of his approach to epistemology which\ncontinues to inform developments today. It may be stated,\n simplified,[1]\n as follows:\n\n\nPartition Principle: Any propositional attitude\npartitions the set of possible worlds into those that are in\naccordance with the attitude and those that are not.\n\n\nThe partition principle may be used to provide a semantics for the\nknowledge operator. Informally,\n\n\n\\(K_{a}\\varphi\\) is true in world w if, and only if,\n\\(\\varphi\\) is true in every world \\(w'\\) compatible with the\ninformation a has at w.\n\n\nHere, agent a knows that \\(\\varphi\\) just in case the agent has\ninformation that rules out every possibility of error and rules out\nevery case where \\(\\neg\\varphi\\).\n2.4 Kripke Models and The Indistinguishability Interpretation of Knowledge\n\nSince the 1960s Kripke models, defined below, have served as\nthe basis of the most widely used semantics for all varieties of modal\nlogic. The use of Kripke models in the representation of epistemic\nconcepts involves taking a philosophical stance with respect to those\nconcepts. One widespread interpretation, especially in theoretical\neconomics and theoretical computer science, understands knowledge in\nterms of informational indistinguishability between possible worlds.\nWhat we will refer to here as the indistinguishability\ninterpretation goes back to Lehmann (1984), and Aumann (1976) has\nan equivalent partition-based framework.\n\nAs the indistinguishability interpretation concerns knowledge, but not\nbelief, we will be working with a language without belief operators.\nTherefore, let the language \\(\\mathcal{L}_{K}\\) be given by the\nBackus-Naur form \n\\[\\varphi::=p\\mid \\neg\\varphi\\mid (\\varphi\\wedge\\varphi)\\mid K_{a}\\varphi\\text{ for } p\\in \\Atom.\\]\n\n\nAs we shall see, the indistinguishability interpretation involves very\nstringent requirements in order for something to qualify as knowledge.\nWe introduce it here for pedagogical purposes, putting the formal\ndetails of the interpretation in place so as to introduce and explain\nrelatively less extreme positions thereafter.\n\nConsider again the case of Zoe, the hen, and the dog. The example\ninvolves two propositions, which we will identify with the formal\natoms:\n\n\np read as \u201cthere is a hen in the yard\u201d.\n\nand\n\nq read as \u201cthere is a dog in the yard\u201d.\n\n\nIt is worth emphasizing that for the purposes of our formalization of\nthis scenario, these two are the only propositions of\ninterest. We are restricting our attention to \\(\\Atom=\\{p,q\\}\\). In\nearly presentations of epistemic logic and in much of standard\nepistemic logic at present, all the atoms of interest are\nincluded from the outset. Obviously, this is an idealized scenario. It\nis important to notice what this approach leaves out. Considerations\nthat are not captured in this way include the appearance of novel\natoms; the idea that other atomic propositions might be introduced at\nsome future state via some process of learning for example, or the\nquestion of an agent\u2019s awareness of propositions; the scenario\nin which an agent might be temporarily unaware of some atom\ndue to some psychological or other factor (see\n Section 5\n for references to so-called awareness logic). For now, the\nmain point is that standard epistemic logic begins with the assumption\nthat the set Atom exhausts the space of propositions for the\nagent.\n\nWith two atoms, there are four different ways a world could\nconsistently be. We can depict each by a box:\n\n\n\n\nThe four boxes may be formally represented by a set\n\\(W=\\{w_{1},w_{2},w_{3},w_{4}\\}\\), typically called a set of\npossible worlds. Each world is further\nlabeled with the atoms true at that world. They are labeled by a\nfunction V, the valuation. The\nvaluation specifies which atoms are true at each world in the\nfollowing way: Given an atom p, \\(V(p)\\) is the subset of\nworlds at which p is\n true.[2]\n That \\(w_{1}\\) is labeled with p and q thus means that\n\\(w_{1}\\in V(p)\\) and \\(w_{1}\\in V(q)\\). In the illustration,\n\\(V(p)=\\{w_{1},w_{2}\\}\\) and \\(V(q)=\\{w_{1},w_{3}\\}\\).\n\nFor presentational purposes, assume that there really is a hen in the\nyard, but no dog. Then \\(w_{2}\\) would represent the\nactual world of the model. In illustrations,\nthe actual world is commonly highlighted:\n\n\n\n\nNow, assume that the hen is always clucking, but that the dog never\nbarks, and that although Zoe has acute hearing, she cannot see the\nyard. Then there are certain possible worlds that Zoe cannot\ndistinguish: possible ways things may be which she cannot\ntell apart. For example, being in the world with only a hen \\((p,\\neg\nq)\\), Zoe cannot tell if she is in the world with both hen and dog\n\\((p,q)\\): her situation is such that Zoe is aware of two ways things\ncould be but her information does not allow her to eliminate\neither.\n\nTo illustrate that one possible world cannot be distinguished from\nanother, an arrow is typically drawn from the former to the\nlatter:\n\n\n\n\nHere, arrows represent a binary relation on possible worlds.\nIn modal logic in general, it is referred to as the\naccessibility relation. Under the\nindistinguishability interpretation of epistemic logic, it is\nsometimes called the indistinguishability\nrelation. Formally, denote the relation \\(R_{a}\\), with\nthe subscript showing the relation belongs to agent a. The\nrelation is a subset of the set of ordered pairs of possible\nworlds, \\(\\{(w,w')\\colon w,w'\\in W\\}\\). One world w\n\u201cpoints\u201d to another \\(w'\\) if \\((w,w')\\in R_{a}\\). In this\ncase, \\(w'\\) is said to be accessible\n(indistinguishable) from w. In the literature, this is\noften written \\(wR_{a}w'\\) or \\(R_{a}ww'\\). The notation\n\u2018\\(w'\\in R_{a}(w)\\)\u2019 is also common: the set \\(R_{a}(w)\\)\nis then the worlds accessible from w, i.e., \n\\[R_{a}(w):=\\{w'\\in W:(w,w')\\in R_{a}\\}.\\]\n\n\nA final note: the set \\(\\{(w,w')\\colon w,w'\\in W\\}\\) is often written\n\\(W\\times W\\), the Cartesian product of W with\nitself.\n\nFor \\(R_{a}\\) to faithfully represent a relation of\nindistinguishability, what worlds should it relate? If Zoe was plunged\nin \\(w_{1}\\) for example, could she tell that she is not in \\(w_{2}\\)?\nNo: the relation of indistinguishability is\nsymmetric\u2014if one cannot tell a from b,\nneither can one tell b from a. That a relation is\nsymmetric is typically drawn by omitting arrow-heads altogether or by\nputting them in both directions:\n\n\n\n\nWhich of the remaining worlds are indistinguishable? Given that the\nhen is always clucking, Zoe has information that allows her to\ndistinguish \\(w_{1}\\) and \\(w_{2}\\) from \\(w_{3}\\) and \\(w_{4}\\) and\nvice versa, cf. symmetry. Hence, no arrows between these. The\nworlds \\(w_{3}\\) and \\(w_{4}\\) are indistinguishable. This brings us\nto the following representation:\n\n\n\n\nSince no information will ever allow Zoe to distinguish something from\nitself, any possible world is thus related to itself and the\nindistinguishability relation is reflexive:\n\n\n\n\nThe standard interpretation of the Zoe example in terms of a possible\nworlds model is now complete. Before turning to a general presentation\nof the indistinguishability interpretation, let us look at what Zoe\nknows.\n\nRecall the informal modal semantics of the knowledge operator from\nabove:\n\n\n\\(K_{a}\\varphi\\) is true in world w if, and only if,\n\\(\\varphi\\) is true in every world \\(w'\\) compatible with the\ninformation a has at w.\n\n\nTo approach a formal definition, take \u2018\\(w\\vDash\\varphi\\)\u2019\nto mean that \\(\\varphi\\) is true in world w. Thus we can,\ndefine truth of \\(K_{a}\\varphi\\) in w by\n\n\n\\(w\\vDash K_{a}\\varphi\\) iff \\(w'\\vDash\\varphi\\) for all \\(w'\\) such\nthat \\(wR_{a}w'\\).\n\n\nThis definition states that a knows \\(\\varphi\\) in world\nw if, and only if, \\(\\varphi\\) is the case in all the worlds\n\\(w'\\) which a cannot distinguish from w.\n\nSo, where does that leave Zoe? First off, the definition allows us to\nevaluate her knowledge in each of the worlds, but seeing as \\(w_{2}\\)\nis the actual world, it is the world of interest. Let a denote\nZoe, here are some examples of what we can say about Zoe\u2019s\nknowledge in \\(w_{2}\\):\n\n\\(w_{2}\\vDash K_{a}p\\). Zoe knows that the hen is in the yard as\nall the worlds indistinguishable from \\(w_{2}\\) that would be\n\\(w_{1}\\) and \\(w_{2}\\) make p true.\n\\(w_{2}\\vDash\\neg K_{a}q\\). Zoe does not know the dog is in the\nyard, as one of the indistinguishable worlds in fact \\(w_{2}\\) itself\nmakes q false.\n\\(w_{2}\\vDash K_{a}K_{a}p\\). Zoe knows that she knows p\nbecause\n\n\n \\(w_{2}\\vDash K_{a}p\\) (cf. 1.) and\n \\(w_{1}\\vDash K_{a}p\\).\n\n\\(w_{2}\\vDash K_{a}\\neg K_{a}q\\). Zoe knows that she does not know\nq because\n\n\n \\(w_{2}\\vDash\\neg K_{a}q\\) (cf. 2.) and \n \\(w_{1}\\vDash\\neg K_{a}q\\).\n\n\n\nWe could say a lot more about Zoe\u2019s knowledge: every formula of\nthe epistemic language without belief operators may be evaluated in\nthe model. It thus represents all Zoe\u2019s higher-order information\nabout her own knowledge of which points 3. and 4. are the first\nexamples.\n\nOne last ingredient is required before we can state the\nindistinguishability interpretation in its full generality. In the\nexample above, it was shown that the indistinguishability relation was\nboth symmetric and reflexive. Formally, these\nproperties may be defined as follows:\n\n\nDefinition: A binary relation \\(R\\subseteq W\\times\nW\\) is\n\nreflexive iff for all \\(w\\in\nW,wRw\\),\nsymmetric iff for all \\(w,w'\\in W,\\) if\n\\(wRw'\\), then \\(w'Rw\\).\n\n\n\nThe missing ingredient is then the relational property of\ntransitivity. \u2018Shorter than\u2019 is an example of a\ntransitive relation: Let x be shorter than y, and let\ny be shorter than z. Then x must be shorter than\nz. So, given \\(w_{1},w_{2}\\) and \\(w_{3}\\), if the relation\nR holds between \\(w_{1}\\) and \\(w_{2}\\) and between \\(w_{2}\\)\nand \\(w_{3}\\), then the arrow between \\(w_{1}\\) and \\(w_{3}\\) is the\nconsequence of requiring the relation to be transitive:\n\n\n\n\nFormally, transitivity is defined as follows:\n\n\nDefinition: A binary relation \\(R\\subseteq W\\times\nW\\) is transitive iff for all \\(w,w',w''\\in\nW,\\) if \\(wRw'\\) and \\(w'Rw''\\), then \\(wRw''\\)\n\n\nA relation that is both reflexive, symmetric and transitive is called\nan equivalence relation.\n\nWith all the components in place, let us now define the Kripke\nmodel:\n\n\nDefinition: A Kripke model\nfor \\(\\mathcal{L}_{K}\\) is a tuple \\(M=(W,R,V)\\) where\n\nW is a non-empty set of possible worlds,\nR is a binary relation on W, and\n\\(V\\colon \\Atom \\longrightarrow\\mathcal{P}(W)\\) is a\nvaluation.\n\n\n\nIn the definition, \u2018\\(\\mathcal{P}(W)\\)\u2019 denotes the\npowerset of W: It consists of all the subsets of\nW. Hence \\(V(p)\\), the valuation of atom p in the model\nM, is some subset of the possible worlds: Those where p\nis true. In this general definition, R can be any relation on\nW.\n\nTo specify which world is actual, one last parameter is added to the\nmodel. When the actual world is specified a Kripke model is commonly\ncalled pointed:\n\n\nDefinition: A pointed Kripke\nmodel for \\(\\mathcal{L}_{K}\\) is a pair \\((M,w)\\)\nwhere\n\n\\(M=(W,R,V)\\) is a Kripke model, and\n\\(w\\in W\\).\n\n\n\nFinally, we may formally define the semantics that was somewhat\nloosely expressed above. This is done by defining a relation between\npointed Kripke models and the formulas of the formal language. The\nrelation is denoted \u2018\\(\\vDash\\)\u2019 and is often called the\nsatisfaction relation.\n\nThe definition then goes as follows:\n\n\nDefinition: Let \\(M=(W,R_{a},V)\\) be a Kripke model\nfor \\(\\mathcal{L}_{K}\\) and let \\((M,w)\\) be a pointed Kripke model.\nThen for all \\(p\\in \\Atom\\) and all\n\\(\\varphi,\\psi\\in\\mathcal{L}_{K}\\)\n \n\\[ \\begin{align}\n(M,w)&\\vDash p & \\textrm{ iff }& w\\in V(p)\\\\\n (M,w)&\\vDash\\neg\\varphi& \\textrm{ iff }& \\textrm{not } (M,w)\\vDash\\varphi\\\\\n (M,w)&\\vDash(\\varphi\\wedge\\psi)& \\textrm{ iff }& (M,w)\\vDash\\varphi \\textrm{ and }(M,w)\\vDash\\psi\\\\\n (M,w)&\\vDash K_{a}\\varphi &\\textrm{ iff }& (M,w')\\vDash\\varphi \\textrm{ for all } w'\\in W \\textrm{ such that } wR_{a}w'. \n\\end{align} \\]\n\n\n\nThe formula \\(\\varphi\\) is satisfied in the\npointed model \\((M,w)\\) iff \\((M,w)\\vDash\\varphi\\).\n\n\nIn full generality, the indistinguishability interpretation holds that\nfor \\(K_{a}\\) to capture knowledge, the relation \\(R_{a}\\) must be an\nequivalence relation. A pointed Kripke model for which this is\nsatisfied is often referred to as an epistemic\nstate. In epistemic states, the relation is denoted by a\ntilde with a subscript: \\(\\sim_{a}\\).\n\nGiven pointed Kripke models and the indistinguishability\ninterpretation, we have a semantic specification of one concept of\nknowledge. With this approach, we can build models of situations\ninvolving knowledge as we did with the toy example of Zoe and the\nhens. We can use these models to determine what the agent does or does\nnot know. We also have the formal foundations in place to begin asking\nquestions concerning how the agent\u2019s knowledge or uncertainty\ndevelops when it receives new information, a topic studied in\n dynamic epistemic logic.\n\nWe may also ask more general questions concerning the concept of\nknowledge modeled using pointed Kripke models with\nindistinguishability relations: Instead of looking at a particular\nmodel at the time and asking which formulas the model makes true, we\ncan ask which general principles all such models agree on.\n2.5 Epistemological Principles in Epistemic Logic\n\nSettling on the correct formal representation of knowledge involves\nreflecting carefully on the epistemological principles to which one is\ncommitted. An uncontroversial example of such a principle which most\nphilosophers will accept is veridicality:\n\n\nIf a proposition is known, then it is true. \n\\[K_{a}\\varphi\\rightarrow\\varphi.\\]\n\n\n\nIn a formal context this principle can be understood to say that if\n\\(\\varphi\\) is known then it should always be satisfied in one\u2019s\nmodels. If it turns out that some of one\u2019s chosen models falsify\nthe veridicality principle, then most philosophers would simply deem\nthose models unacceptable.\n\nReturning to pointed Kripke models, we can now ask which principles\nthese models commit one to. In order to begin answering this question,\nwe need to understand the most general features of our formalism. The\nstrategy in modal logic in general (see Blackburn, de Rijke, &\nVenema 2001) is to abstract away from any given model\u2019s\ncontingent features. Contingent features would include, for\nexample, the specific number of worlds under consideration, the\nspecific valuation of the atoms, and the choice of an actual world. In\nthis case, the only features that are not contingent are those\nrequired by the general definition of a pointed Kripke model.\n\nTo abstract suitably, take a pointed Kripke model \\((M,w)=(W,R,V,w)\\).\nTo determine whether the relation of this model is an equivalence\nrelation we only need to consider the worlds and the relation. The\npair of these elements constitute the fundamental level of the model\nand is called the frame of the model:\n\n\nDefinition: Let \\((M,w)=(W,R,V,w)\\) be a pointed\nKripke model. Then the pair \\((W,R)\\) is called the\nframe of \\((M,w)\\). Any model \\((M',w')\\)\nwhich shares the frame \\((W,R)\\) is said to be built\non \\((W,R)\\).\n\n\nConsider again the epistemic state for Zoe from above:\n\n\n\n\nSeveral other models may be built on the same frame. The following are\ntwo examples:\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the notion of a frame, we may define the notion of validity of\ninterest. It is the second term defined in the following:\n\n\nDefinition: A formula \\(\\varphi\\) is said to be\nvalid in the frame \\(F=(W,R)\\) iff every\npointed Kripke model build on F satisfies \\(\\varphi\\), i.e.,\niff for every \\((M,w)=(F,V,w)=(W,R,V,w)\\), \\((M,w)\\vDash\\varphi\\). A\nformula \\(\\varphi\\) is valid on the class of\nframes \\(\\mathsf{F}\\) (written\n\\(\\mathsf{F}\\vDash\\varphi\\)) iff \\(\\varphi\\) is valid in every frame\nF in \\(\\mathsf{F}\\).\n\n\nThe set of formulas valid on a class of frames \\(\\mathsf{F}\\) is\ncalled the logic of \\(\\mathsf{F}\\). Denote\nthis logic that is, the set\n\\(\\{\\varphi\\in\\mathcal{L}_{K}\\colon\\mathsf{F}\\vDash\\varphi\\}\\) by\n\\(\\Lambda_{\\mathsf{F}}\\). This is a semantic approach to\ndefining logics, each just a set of formulas. One may also define\nlogics proof-theoretically by defining a logic as the set of\nformulas provable in some system. With logics as just sets of\nformulas, soundness and completeness results may\nthen be expressed using set inclusion. To exemplify, let\n\\(\\mathsf{A}\\) be a set of axioms and write\n\\(\\mathsf{A}\\vdash\\varphi\\) when \\(\\varphi\\) is provable from\n\\(\\mathsf{A}\\) using some given set of deduction rules. Let the\nresulting logic the set of theorems be denoted\n\\(\\Lambda_{\\mathsf{A}}\\). It is the set of formulas from\n\\(\\mathcal{L}_{K}\\) provable from \\(\\mathsf{A}\\), i.e., the set\n\\(\\{\\varphi\\in\\mathcal{L}_{K}\\colon\\mathsf{A}\\vdash\\varphi\\}\\). The\nlogic \\(\\Lambda_{\\mathsf{A}}\\) is sound with respect to \\(\\mathsf{F}\\)\niff \\(\\Lambda_{\\mathsf{A}}\\subseteq\\Lambda_{\\mathsf{F}}\\) and complete\nwith respect to \\(\\mathsf{F}\\) iff\n\n\\(\\Lambda_{\\mathsf{F}}\\subseteq\\Lambda_{\\mathsf{A}}\\).[3]\n\nReturning to the indistinguishability interpretation of knowledge, we\nmay then seek to find the epistemological principles which the\ninterpretation is committed to. There is a trivial answer of little\ndirect interest: Let \\(\\mathsf{EQ}\\) be the class of frames with\nequivalence relations. Then the logic of the indistinguishability\ninterpretation is the set of formulas of \\(\\mathcal{L}_{K}\\) which are\nvalid over \\(\\mathsf{EQ}\\), i.e., the set\n\\(\\Lambda_{\\mathsf{EQ}}:=\\{\\varphi\\in\\mathcal{L}_{K}\\colon\\mathsf{EQ}\\vDash\\varphi\\}\\).\nNot very informative.\n\nTaking an axiomatic approach to specifying the logic,\nhowever, yields a presentation in terms of easy to grasp principles.\nTo start with the simplest, then the principle T states that knowledge\nis factual: If the agent knows \\(\\varphi\\), then \\(\\varphi\\)\nmust be true. The more cumbersome K states that if the agent knows an\nimplication, then if the agent knows the antecedent, it also knows the\nconsequent. I.e., if we include the derivation rule modus\nponens (from \\(\\varphi\\rightarrow\\psi\\) and \\(\\varphi\\), conclude\n\\(\\psi\\)) as rule of our logic of knowledge, K states that knowledge\nis closed under implication. The principle B states that if\n\\(\\varphi\\) is true, then the agent knows that it considers\n\\(\\varphi\\) possible. Finally, 4 states that if the agent knows\n\\(\\varphi\\), then it knows that it knows \\(\\varphi\\). T, B and 4 in\nthe table below (the names are historical and not all meaningful).\n\n\\[ \\begin{align}\n\\textrm{K} & & K_{a}(\\varphi\\rightarrow\\psi) & \\rightarrow(K_{a}\\varphi\\rightarrow K_{a}\\psi)\\\\\n \\textrm{T} & & K_{a}\\varphi & \\rightarrow\\varphi\\\\\n \\textrm{B} & & \\varphi & \\rightarrow K_{a}\\widehat{K}_{a}\\varphi\\\\\n \\textrm{4} & & K_{a}\\varphi & \\rightarrow K_{a}K_{a}\\varphi\\\\\n \n\\end{align} \\]\n\n\nIn lieu of epistemological intuitions, we could discuss a concept of\nknowledge by discussing these and other principles. Should we accept T\nas a principle that knowledge follows? What about the others? Before\nwe proceed, let us first make clear how the four above principles\nrelate to the indistinguishability interpretation. To do so, we need\nthe notion of a normal modal logic. In the below definition,\nas in the above principles, we are technically using formula\nschemas. For example, in \\(K_{a}\\varphi\\rightarrow\\varphi\\), the\n\\(\\varphi\\) is a variable ranging over formulas in\n\\(\\mathcal{L}_{K}\\). Thus, strictly speaking,\n\\(K_{a}\\varphi\\rightarrow\\varphi\\) is not a formula, but a\nscheme for obtaining a formula. A modal instance of\n\\(K_{a}\\varphi\\rightarrow\\varphi\\) is then the formula obtained by\nletting \\(\\varphi\\) be some concrete formula from \\(\\mathcal{L}_{K}\\).\nFor example, \\(K_{a}p\\rightarrow p\\) and \\(K_{a}(p\\wedge\nK_{a}q)\\rightarrow(p\\wedge K_{a}q)\\) are both modal instances of\nT.\n\n\nDefinition: Let \\(\\Lambda\\subseteq\\mathcal{L}_{K}\\)\nbe a set of modal formulas. Then \\(\\Lambda\\) is a normal\nmodal logic iff \\(\\Lambda\\) satisfies all of the\nfollowing:\n\n\\(\\Lambda\\) contains all modal instances of the classical\npropositional tautologies.\n\\(\\Lambda\\) contains all modal instances of K.\n\\(\\Lambda\\) is closed under modus ponens: If\n\\(\\varphi\\in\\Lambda\\) and \\(\\varphi\\rightarrow\\psi\\in\\Lambda\\), then\n\\(\\psi\\in\\Lambda\\).\n\\(\\Lambda\\) is closed under generalization (a.k.a.\nnecessitation): If \\(\\varphi\\in\\Lambda\\), then\n\\(K_{a}\\varphi\\in\\Lambda\\).\n\n\n\nThere is a unique smallest normal modal logic (given the set\nAtom)that which contains exactly what is required by the\ndefinition and nothing more. It is often called the\nminimal normal modal logic and is denoted by\nthe boldface K (not to be confused with the\nnon-boldface K denoting the schema).\n\nThe logic K is just a set of formulas from\n\\(\\mathcal{L}_{K}\\). I.e.,\nK\u00a0\\(\\subseteq\\mathcal{L}_{K}\\). Points 1.4.\ngives a perspective on this set: They provide an\naxiomatization. Often, as below, the schema K is referred to\nas an axiom, though really the instantiations of K are axioms.\n\nTo K, we can add additional principles as axioms\n(axiom schemes) to obtain stronger logics (logics that have additional\ntheorems: Logics \\(\\Lambda\\) for which\nK\u00a0\\(\\subseteq\\Lambda\\)). Of immediate interest\nis the logic called S5:\n\n\nDefinition: The logic S5 is the\nsmallest normal modal logic containing all modal instances of T, B,\nand 4.\n\n\nHere, then, is the relationship between the above four principles and\nthe indistinguishability interpretation:\n\n\nTheorem 1: The logic S5 is the logic\nof the class of pointed Kripke models build on frames with equivalence\nrelations. I.e., \\(\\textbf{S5} =\\Lambda_{\\mathsf{EQ}}\\).\n\n\nWhat does this theorem tell us with respect to the principles of\nknowledge, then? In one direction it tells us that if one accepts the\nindistinguishability interpretation, then one has implicitly accepted\nthe principles K, T, B and 4 as reasonable for knowledge. In the other\ndirection, it tells us that if one finds that S5 is\nthe appropriate logic of knowledge and one finds that pointed\nKripke models are the right way to semantically represent knowledge,\nthen one must use an equivalence relation. Whether one should\ninterpret this relation in terms of indistinguishability, though, is a\nmatter on which logic is silent.\n\nIn discussing principles for knowledge, it may be that some of the\nfour above seem acceptable, while others do not: One may disagree with\nthe acceptability of B and 4, say, while accepting K and T. In\nunderstanding the relationship between S5 and\nequivalence relations, a more fine-grained perspective is beneficial:\nTheorem 1 may be chopped into smaller pieces reflecting the\ncontribution of the individual principles K, T, 4 and B to the\nequivalence requirementi.e., that the relation should be at the same\ntime reflexive, symmetric and transitive.\n\n\nTheorem 2: Let \\(F=(W,R)\\) be a frame. Then:\n\nAll modal instances of K are valid in F.\nAll modal instances of T are valid in F iff R is\nreflexive.\nAll modal instances of B are valid in F iff R is\nsymmetric.\nAll modal instances of 4 are valid in F iff R is\ntransitive.\n\n\n\nThere are a number of insights to gain from Theorem 2. First, if one\nwants to use any type of Kripke model to capture knowledge,\nthen one must accept K. Skipping some details, one must in fact accept\nthe full logic K as this is the logic of the class of\nall Kripke models (see, e.g., Blackburn, de Rijke, &\nVenema 2001).\n\nSecond, the theorem shows that there is an intimate relationship\nbetween the individual epistemic principles and the properties on the\nrelation. This, in turn, means that one, in general, may approach the\n\u201clogic\u201d in epistemic logic from two sides from intuitions\nabout the accessibility relation or from intuitions about epistemic\nprinciples.\n\nSeveral normal modal logical systems weaker than S5\nhave been suggested in the literature. Here, we specify the logics by\nthe set of their modal axioms. For example, the logic\nK is given by \\(\\{\\text{K}\\}\\), while\nS5 is given by\n\\(\\{\\text{K},\\text{T},\\text{B},\\text{4}\\}\\). To establish\nnomenclature, the following table contains a selection of principles\nfrom the literature with the frame properties they characterize, cf.\nAucher (2014) and Blackburn, de Rijke, & Venema (2001), on the\nline below them. The frame conditions are not all straightforward.\n\nIn Table 1, the subscript on \\(R_{a}\\) is omitted to ease readability,\nand so is the domain of quantification W over which the worlds\nvariables \\(x,y,z\\) range.\n\n\n\n\n\nK\n\\(K_{a}(\\varphi\\rightarrow\\psi)\\rightarrow(K_{a}\\varphi\\rightarrow\nK_{a}\\psi)\\)\n\nNone: Not applicable \n\nD\n\\(K_{a}\\varphi\\rightarrow\\widehat{K}_{a}\\varphi\\)\n\nSerial: \\(\\forall x\\exists y,xRy\\). \n\nT\n\\(K_{a}\\varphi\\rightarrow\\varphi\\)\n\nReflexive: \\(\\forall x,xRx\\). \n\n4\n\\(K_{a}\\varphi\\rightarrow K_{a}K_{a}\\varphi\\)\n\nTransitive: \\(\\forall x,y,z,\\text{if }xRy\\text{ and }yRz\\text{, then\n}xRz\\). \n\nB\n\\(\\varphi\\rightarrow K_{a}\\widehat{K}_{a}\\varphi\\)\n\nSymmetric: \\(\\forall x,y,\\text{if }xRy\\text{, then }yRx\\). \n\n5\n\\(\\neg K_{a}\\varphi\\rightarrow K_{a}\\neg K_{a}\\varphi\\)\n\nEuclidean: \\(\\forall x,y,z,\\text{if }xR_{a}y\\text{ and }xR_{a}z\\text{,\nthen }yRz\\). \n\n.2\n\\(\\widehat{K}_{a}K_{a}\\varphi\\rightarrow\nK_{a}\\widehat{K}_{a}\\varphi\\)\n\nConfluent: \\(\\forall x,y,\\text{if }xRy\\text{ and }xRy',\\text{ then\n}\\exists z,yRz\\text{ and }y'Rz\\). \n\n.3\n\\((\\widehat{K}_{a}\\varphi\\wedge\\widehat{K}_{a}\\psi)\\rightarrow(\\widehat{K}_{a}(\\varphi\\wedge\\widehat{K}_{a}\\psi)\\vee\\widehat{K}_{a}(\\varphi\\wedge\\psi)\\vee\\widehat{K}_{a}(\\psi\\wedge\\widehat{K}_{a}\\varphi))\\)\n\nNo branching to the right: \\(\\forall x,y,z,\\text{if }xRy\\text{ and\n}xRz,\\text{then }yRz\\text{ or }y=z\\text{ or }zRy\\) \n\n.3.2\n\\((\\widehat{K}_{a}\\varphi\\wedge\\widehat{K}_{a}K_{a}\\psi)\\rightarrow\nK_{a}(\\widehat{K}_{a}\\varphi\\vee\\psi)\\)\n\nSemi-Euclidean: \\(\\forall x,y,z,\\) if \\(xRy\\) and \\(xRz\\), then\n\\(zRx\\) or \\(yRz\\). \n\n.4\n\\((\\varphi\\wedge\\widehat{K}_{a}K_{a}\\varphi)\\rightarrow\nK_{a}\\varphi\\)\n\nName unknown to authors: \\(\\forall x,y,\\) if \\(xRy\\), then \\(\\forall\nz\\), if \\(xRz\\), then \\(x = z\\) or \\(yRz\\).  \n\n\nTable 1. Epistemic Principles and their\nframe conditions.\n\n\nAdding epistemic principles as axioms to the basic minimal normal\nmodal logic K yields new, normal modal logics.

Logic names and axioms\n\n\nDifferent axiomatic specifications may produce the same logic. Notice,\ne.g., that the table\u2019s axiomatic specification\n\\(\\{\\text{K},\\text{T},\\text{5}\\}\\) of S5 does not\nmatch that given in the definition preceding Theorem 1,\n\\(\\{\\text{K},\\text{T},\\text{B},\\text{4}\\}\\). Note also, there is more\nthan one axiomatization of S5: the axioms\n\\(\\{\\text{K},\\text{T},\\text{5}\\}\\),\n\\(\\{\\text{K},\\text{T},\\text{B},\\text{4}\\}\\),\n\\(\\{\\text{K},\\text{D},\\text{B},\\text{4}\\}\\) and\n\\(\\{\\text{K},\\text{D},\\text{B},\\text{5}\\}\\) all give the\nS5 logic (e.g., Chellas 1980). An often seen variant\nis \\(\\{\\text{K},\\text{T},\\text{4},\\text{5}\\}\\). However, it is\nredundant to add it as all its instances can be proven from K, T and\n5. But as both 4 and 5 capture important epistemic principles (see\n Section 2.6),\n 4 is often sometimes included for the sake of philosophical\ntransparency. For more equivalences between modal logics, see, e.g.,\nthe entry on\n modal logic\n or Chellas (1980) or Blackburn, de Rijke, and Venema (2001).\n\nLogics may be stronger or weaker than each other, and knowing the\nframe properties of their axioms may help us to understand their\nrelationship. For example, as 4 is derivable from\n\\(\\{\\text{K},\\text{T},\\text{5}\\}\\), all the theorems of\nS4 are derivable in S5.\nS5 is thus at least as strong as\nS4. In fact, S5 is also strictly\nstronger: It can prove things which S4\ncannot.\n\nThat S5 may be axiomatized both by\n\\(\\{\\text{K},\\text{T},\\text{B},\\text{4}\\}\\) and\n\\(\\{\\text{K},\\text{T},\\text{5}\\}\\) may be seen through the frame\nproperties of the axioms: every reflexive and euclidean relation (T\nand 5) is an equivalence relation (T, B, and 4). This also shows the\nredundancy of 4: If one has assumed a relation reflexive and\neuclidean, then it adds nothing new to additionally assume it to be\ntransitive. In general, having an understanding of the interplay\nbetween relational properties is of great aid in seeing relationships\nbetween modal logics. For example, noticing that every reflexive\nrelation is also serial means that all formulas valid on the class of\nserial models are also valid on the class of reflexive models. Hence,\nevery theorem of D is thus a theorem of\nT. Hence T is at least as strong as\nD (i.e., \\(\\textbf{D}\\subseteq\\textbf{T}\\)). That\nT is also strictly stronger (not\n\\(\\textbf{T}\\subseteq\\textbf{D}\\)) can be shown by finding a serial,\nnon-reflexive model which does not satisfy some theorem of\nT (for example \\(K_{a}p\\rightarrow p\\)).\n2.6 Principles of Knowledge and Belief\n\nWith the formal background of epistemic logic in place, it is\nstraightforward to slightly vary the framework in order to accommodate\nthe concept of belief. Return to the language \\(\\mathcal{L}_{KB}\\) of\nboth knowledge and belief: \n\\[\\varphi::=p\\mid \\neg\\varphi\\mid (\\varphi\\wedge\\varphi)\\mid K_{a}\\psi\\mid B_{a}\\psi,\\text{ for } p\\in \\Atom.\\]\n\n\nTo interpret knowledge and belief formulas together in pointed Kripke\nmodels, all that is needed is an additional relation between possible\nworlds:\n\n\nDefinition: A pointed Kripke\nmodel for \\(\\mathcal{L}_{KB}\\) is a tuple\n\\((M,w)=(W,R_{K},R_{B},V,w)\\) where\n\nW is a non-empty set of possible worlds,\n\\(R_{K}\\) and \\(R_{B}\\) are a binary relations on W,\n\\(V\\colon \\Atom\\longrightarrow\\mathcal{P}(W)\\) is a valuation,\nand\n\\(w\\in W\\).\n\n\n\n\\(R_{K}\\) is the relation for the knowledge operator and \\(R_{B}\\) the\nrelation for the belief operator. The definition makes no further\nassumptions about their properties. In the figure below we provide an\nillustration, where the arrows are labeled in accordance with the\nrelation they correspond to. The reflexive loop at \\(w_{3}\\) is a\nlabel indicating that it belongs to both relations, i.e.,\n\\((w_{3},w_{3})\\in R_{K}\\) and \\((w_{3},w_{3})\\in R_{B}\\).\n\n\n\n\nThe satisfaction relation is defined as above, but with the obvious\nchanges for knowledge and belief:\n\n\n\\((M,w)\\vDash K_{a}\\varphi\\) iff \\((M,w')\\vDash\\varphi\\) for all\n\\(w'\\in W\\) such that \\(wR_{K}w'\\).\n\n\\((M,w)\\vDash B_{a}\\varphi\\) iff \\((M,w')\\vDash\\varphi\\) for all\n\\(w'\\in W\\) such that \\(wR_{B}w'\\).\n\n\nThe indistinguishability interpretation puts very strong requirements\non the accessibility relation for knowledge. These have now been\nstripped away and so has any commitment to the principles T, B, D, 4\nand 5. Taking Kripke models as basic semantics, we are still committed\nto K, though this principle is not unproblematic as we shall see below\nin our discussion of the problem of logical omniscience.\n\nOf the principles from Table 1, T, D, B, 4 and 5 have been discussed\nmost extensively in the literature on epistemic logic, both as\nprinciples for knowledge and as principles for belief. The principle T\nfor knowledge \n\\[ K_{a}\\varphi\\rightarrow\\varphi \\]\n\n\nis broadly accepted. Knowledge is commonly taken to be\nveridical\u2014only true propositions can be known. For,\ne.g., Hintikka (1962) and Fagin et al. (1995), the failure of T for\nbelief is the defining difference between the two notions.\n\nThough belief is not commonly taken to be veridical, beliefs are\ntypically taken to be consistent. I.e., agents are taken to\nnever believe the contradiction that is, any formula\nequivalent with \\((p\\wedge\\neg p)\\) or \\(\\bot\\), for short. That\nbeliefs should be consistent is then captured by the principle\n\n\\[\\neg B_{a}\\bot.\\]\n\n\nThe principle \\(\\neg B_{a}\\bot\\) is, on Kripke models, equivalent with\nthe principle D, \\(B_{a}\\varphi\\rightarrow\\widehat{B}_{a}\\varphi\\).\nHence the validity of \\(\\neg B_{a}\\bot\\) requires serial frames.\nWitness, e.g., its failure in \\(w_{1}\\) above: As there are no worlds\naccessible through \\(R_{B}\\), all accessible worlds satisfy\n\\(\\bot\\). Hence \\(w_{1}\\) satisfies \\(B_{a}\\bot\\), violating\nconsistency. Notice also that \\(\\neg B_{a}\\bot\\) may be re-written to\n\\(\\widehat{B}_{a}\\top\\), which is true at a world just in case some\nworld is accessible through \\(R_{B}\\). Its validity thus ensures\nseriality.\n\nNotice that the veridicality of knowledge ensures its consistency: Any\nreflexive frame is automatically serial. Hence accepting\n\\(K_{a}\\varphi\\rightarrow\\varphi\\) implies accepting \\(\\neg\nK_{a}\\bot\\).\n\nOf the principles D, 4 and 5, the two latter have received so far the\nmost attention, both for knowledge and for belief. They are commonly\ninterpreted as governing of principled access to own mental\nstates. The 4 principles \n\\[ \\begin{align}\nK_{a}\\varphi & \\rightarrow K_{a}K_{a}\\varphi\\\\\n B_{a}\\varphi & \\rightarrow B_{a}B_{a}\\varphi\\\\\n \n\\end{align} \\]\n\n\nare often referred to as principles of positive\nintrospection, or for knowledge the \u2018KK\u2019\nprinciple. Both principles are deemed acceptable by, e.g.,\nHintikka (1962) on grounds different from introspection. He\nargues based on an autoepistemic analysis of knowledge, using a\nnon-Kripkean possible worlds semantics called model systems.\nHintikka holds that when an agent commits to knowing \\(\\varphi\\), the\nagent commits to holding the same attitude no matter what new\ninformation the agent will encounter in the future. This entails that\nin all the agent\u2019s epistemic alternatives\u2014for Hintikka,\nall the model sets (partial descriptions of possible worlds) where the\nagent knows at least as much they now do&\\madash the agent still\nknows \\(\\varphi\\). As \\(K_{a}\\varphi\\) thus holds in all the\nagent\u2019s epistemic alternatives, Hintikka concludes that\n\\(K_{a}K_{a}\\varphi\\). Likewise, Hintikka endorses 4 for belief, but\nLenzen raises objections (Lenzen 1978: ch. 4).\n\nWilliamson argues against the general acceptability of the principle\n(Williamson 2000: ch. 5) for a concept of knowledge based on slightly\ninexact observations, a so-called margin of error principle\n(see, e.g., Aucher 2014 for a short summary).\n\nThe 5 principles \n\\[ \\begin{align}\n\\neg K_{a}\\varphi &\\rightarrow K_{a}\\neg K_{a}\\varphi\\\\\n \\neg B_{a}\\varphi &\\rightarrow B_{a}\\neg B_{a}\\varphi\\\\\n \n\\end{align} \\]\n\n\nare often referred to as principles of negative\nintrospection. Negative introspection is quite controversial as\nit poses very high demands on knowledge and belief. The schema 5 may\nbe seen as a closed world assumption (Hendricks 2005): The\nagent has a complete overview of all the possible worlds and own\ninformation. If \\(\\neg\\psi\\) is considered possible\n(\\(\\widehat{K}_{a}\\neg\\psi\\), i.e., \\(\\neg K_{a}\\psi\\)), then the\nagent knows it is considered possible (\\(K_{a}\\neg K_{a}\\psi\\)). Such\na closed world assumption is natural when constructing hyper-rational\nagents in, e.g., computer science or game theory, where the agents are\nassumed to reason as hard as logically possible about their own\ninformation when making decisions.\n\nArguing against 5 is Hintikka (1962), using his conception of\nepistemic alternatives. Having accepted T and 4 for knowledge, 5\nstands or falls with the assumption of a symmetric accessibility\nrelation. But, Hintikka argues, the accessibility relation is not\nsymmetric: If the agent possesses some amount of information at model\nset \\(s_{1}\\), then the model set \\(s_{2}\\) where the agent has\nlearned something more will be an epistemic alternative to \\(s_{1}\\).\nBut \\(s_{1}\\) will not be an epistemic alternative to \\(s_{2}\\),\nbecause in \\(s_{1}\\), the agent does by hypothesis not know as much as\nit does in \\(s_{2}\\). Hence the relation is not symmetric, so 5 is not\na principle of knowledge, on Hintikka\u2019s account.\n\nGiven Hintikka\u2019s non-standard semantics, it is a bit difficult\nto pin down whether he would accept a normal modal logic as the logic\nof knowledge and belief, but if so, then S4 and\nKD4 would be the closest candidates (see Hendricks\n& Rendsvig 2018 for this point). By contrast, for knowledge von\nKutschera argued for S4.4 (1976), Lenzen suggested\nS4.2 (1978), van der Hoek argued for\nS4.3 (1993), and Fagin, Halpern, Moses, and Vardi\n(1995) and many others use S5 for knowledge and\nKD45 for belief.\n\nBeyond principles governing knowledge and principles governing belief,\none may also consider principles governing the interplay between\nknowledge and belief. Three principles of interest are\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\tag*{KB1} K_{a}\\varphi & \\rightarrow B_{a}\\varphi\\\\\n \\tag*{KB2} B_{a}\\varphi & \\rightarrow K_{a}B_{a}\\varphi\\\\\n \\tag*{KB3} B_{a}\\varphi & \\rightarrow B_{a}K_{a}\\varphi\\\\\n \n\\end{align} \\]\n\n\nThe principles KB1 and KB2 were introduced by Hintikka (1962), who\nendorses only the former (see \u00a73.7), noting that Plato is also\ncommitted to KB1 in Theatetus. The first principle, KB1,\ncaptures the intuition that knowledge is a stronger notion than\nbelief. The second\u2014like 4 and 5\u2014captures the idea that one\nhas privileged access to one\u2019s own beliefs. The third, stemming\nfrom Lenzen (1978), captures the notion that beliefs are held with\nsome kind of conviction: if something is believed, it is believed to\nbe known.\n\nThough the interaction principles KB1\u2014KB3 may look innocent on\ntheir own, they may lead to counterintuitive conclusions when combined\nwith specific logics of knowledge and belief. First, Voorbraak (1993)\nshows that combining 5 for knowledge and D for belief with KB1,\nimplies that \n\\[B_{a}K_{a}\\varphi\\rightarrow K_{a}\\varphi\\]\n\n\nis a theorem of the resulting logic. Assuming that knowledge is\ntruthful, this theorem entails that agents cannot believe to know\nsomething which happens to be false.\n\nIf additionally KB3 is added, the notions of knowledge and belief\ncollapse. I.e., it may be proven that\n\\(B_{a}\\varphi\\rightarrow K_{a}\\varphi\\), which, in combination with\nKB1 entails that \n\\[B_{a}\\varphi\\leftrightarrow K_{a}\\varphi.\\]\n\n\nHence, the two notions have collapsed to one. This was stated in 1986,\nby Kraus and Lehmann.\n\nIf one is not interested in knowledge and belief collapsing, one must\nthus give something up: One cannot have both 5 for knowledge, D for\nbelief and KB1 and KB3 governing their interaction. Again, results\nconcerning correspondence between principles and relational properties\nmay assist: In 1993, van der Hoek showed, based on a semantic analysis\nthat where the four principles are jointly sufficient for collapse,\nno subset of them is. Giving up any one principle will thus\neliminate the collapse. Weakening KB1 to hold only for non-modal\nformulas is also sufficient to avoid collapse (cf. Halpern 1996).\n\nFor more on epistemic interaction principles, the principles .2, .3,\n.3.2. and .4, and relations to so-called conditional beliefs,\nsee Aucher (2014). For an introduction to conditional beliefs and\nrelations to several other types of knowledge from the philosophical\nliterature, see Baltag and Smets (2008). The latter also includes\ndiscussion concerning the interdefinability of various notions, as\ndoes Halpern, Samet, and Segev (2009) for knowledge and\n(non-conditional) belief.\n\nNote that although we mainly focus on the Kripke semantics in this\nentry, there are other epistemic models for potentially weaker logic,\nsuch as neighborhood models (e.g., van Benthem et al. 2014) and\ntopological models (e.g., Baltag, Bezhanishvili, et al. 2019). \n3. Knowledge in Groups\n\nWe human beings are preoccupied with the epistemic states of other\nagents. In ordinary life, we reason with varying degrees of success\nabout what others know. We are especially concerned with what others\nknow about us, and often specifically about what they know about what\nwe know.\n\n\nDoes she know that I know where she buried the treasure?\n\nDoes she know that I know that she knows?\n\nAnd so on.\n\n\nEpistemic logic can reveal interesting epistemic features of systems\ninvolving groups of agents. In some cases, for example, emergent\nsocial phenomena depend on agents reasoning in particular ways about\nthe knowledge and beliefs of other agents. As we have seen,\ntraditional systems of epistemic logic applied only to single-agent\ncases. However, they can be extended to groups or multi-agent systems\nin a relatively straightforward manner.\n\nAs David Lewis noted in his book Convention (1969) many\nprominent features of social life depend on agents assuming that the\nrules of some practice are matters of common knowledge. For\nexample, drivers know that a red traffic light indicates that they\nshould stop at an intersection. However, for the convention of traffic\nlights to be in place at all, it is first necessary that drivers must\nalso know that other drivers know that red means\nstop. In addition, drivers must also know that everyone knows\nthat everyone knows that \u2026. The conventional role of traffic\nlights relies on all drivers knowing that all drivers know the rule,\nthat the rule is a piece of\n common knowledge.\n\nA variety of norms, social and linguistic practices, agent\ninteractions and games presuppose common knowledge, first formalized\nby Aumann (1976) and with earliest epistemic logical treatments by\nLehmann (1984) and by Halpern and Moses (1984). In order to see how\nepistemic logic sheds light on these phenomena, it is necessary to\nintroduce a little more formalism. Following the standard treatment\n(see, e.g., Fagin et al. 1995), we can syntactically augment the\nlanguage of propositional logic with n knowledge operators, one\nfor each agent involved in the group of agents under consideration.\nThe primary difference between the semantics given for a mono-agent\nand a multi-agent semantics is roughly that n accessibility\nrelations are introduced. A modal system for n agents is\nobtained by joining together n modal logics where for\nsimplicity it may be assumed that the agents are homogenous in the\nsense that they may all be described by the same logical system. The\nepistemic logical system for n agents consists of n\ncopies of a certain modal system. In such an extended epistemic logic\nit is possible to express that some agent in the group knows a certain\nfact that an agent knows that another agent knows a fact etc. It is\npossible to develop the logic even further: Not only may an agent know\nthat another agent knows a fact, but they may all know this fact\nsimultaneously.\n3.1 Multi-Agent Languages and Models\n\nTo represent knowledge for a set \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) of n agents,\nfirst let\u2019s stipulate a language. Let \\(\\mathcal{L}_{Kn}\\) be\ngiven by the Backus-Naur form \n\\[\\varphi::=p\\mid \\neg\\varphi\\mid (\\varphi\\wedge\\varphi)\\mid K_{i}\\varphi\\,\\text{ for } p\\in\\Atom,i\\in\\mathcal{A}.\\]\n\n\nTo represent knowledge for all n agents jointly in pointed\nKripke models, all that is needed is to add suitably many\nrelations:\n\n\nDefinition: A pointed Kripke\nmodel for \\(\\mathcal{L}_{Kn}\\) is a tuple\n\\((M,w)=(W,\\{R_{i}\\}_{i\\in\\mathcal{A}},V,w)\\) where\n\nW is a non-empty set of possible worlds,\nFor every \\(i\\in\\mathcal{A}\\), \\(R_{i}\\) is a binary relation on\nW,\n\\(V\\colon \\Atom\\longrightarrow\\mathcal{P}(W)\\) is a valuation,\nand\n\\(w\\in W\\).\n\n\n\nTo also incorporate beliefs, simply apply the same move as in the\nsingle agent case: augment the language and let there be two relations\nfor each agent.\n\nThe definition uses a family of relations\n\\(\\{R_{i}\\}_{i\\in\\mathcal{A}}\\). In the literature, the same is\ndenoted \\((W,R_{i},V,w)_{i\\in\\mathcal{A}}\\). Alternatively, R\nis taken to be a function sending agents to relations, i.e.,\n\\(R:\\mathcal{A\\rightarrow}\\mathcal{P}(W\\times W)\\). Then for each\n\\(i\\in\\mathcal{A}\\), \\(R(i)\\) is a relation on W, often denoted\n\\(R_{i}\\). These are stylistic choices.\n\nWhen considering only a single agent, it is typically not relevant to\ninclude more worlds in W than there are possible valuations of\natoms. In multi-agent cases, this is not the case: to express the\ndifferent forms of available higher-order knowledge, many copies of\n\u201cthe same\u201d world are needed. Let us exemplify for\n\\(\\mathcal{A}=\\{a,b\\}\\), \\(\\Atom=\\{p\\}\\) and each\n\\(R_{i},i\\in\\mathcal{A},\\) an equivalence relation. Let us represent\nthat both a and b know p, but b does not\nknow that a knows p, i.e., \\(K_{a}p\\wedge\nK_{b}p\\wedge\\neg K_{b}K_{a}p\\). Then we need three worlds:\n\n\n\n\nIf we delete \\(w_{1}\\) and let \\(w_{2}\\) be the actual world, then\na would lose knowledge in p: both p worlds are\nneeded. In general, if W is assumed to have any fixed, finite\nsize, there will be some higher-order information formula that cannot\nbe satisfied in it.\n3.2 Notions of Group Knowledge\n\nMulti-agent systems are interesting for other reasons than to\nrepresent higher-order information. The individual agents\u2019\ninformation may also be pooled to capture what the agents know\njointly, as group knowledge (see Baltag, Boddy, & Smets 2018 for a\nrecent discussion). A standard notion is this style is distributed\nknowledge: The knowledge the group would have if the\nagents share all their individual knowledge. To represent it, augment\nthe language \\(\\mathcal{L}_{Kn}\\) with operators \n\\[D_{G}\\text{ for }G\\subseteq\\mathcal{A},\\]\n\n\nto make \\(D_{G}\\varphi\\) a well-formed formula. Where\n\\(G\\subseteq\\mathcal{A}\\) is a group of agents, the formula\n\\(D_{G}\\varphi\\) reads that it is distributed knowledge in the\ngroup G that \\(\\varphi\\).\n\nTo evaluate \\(D_{G}\\varphi\\), we define a new relation from those\nalready present in the model. The idea behind the definition is that\nif some one agent has eliminated a world as an epistemic alternative,\nthen so will the group. Define the relation as the intersection of the\nindividual agents\u2019 relations: \n\\[R_{G}^{D}=\\bigcap_{i\\in G}R_{i}\\]\n\n\nIn the three state model, \\(R_{G}^{D}\\) contains only the three loops.\nTo evaluate a distributed knowledge formula, use the same form as for\nother modal operators: \n\\[(M,w)\\vDash D_{G}\\varphi\\text{ iff }(M,w')\\vDash\\varphi\\text{ for all }w'\\in W\\text{ such that }wR_{G}^{D}w'.\\]\n\n\nIt may be the case that some very knowing agent knows all that is\ndistributed knowledge in G, but it is not guaranteed. To\ncapture that all the agents know \\(\\varphi\\), we could use the\nconjunction of the formulas \\(K_{i}\\varphi\\) for \\(\\in\\mathcal{A}\\),\ni.e., \\(\\bigwedge_{i\\in\\mathcal{A}}K_{i}\\varphi\\). This is a\nwell-defined formula if \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) is finite (which it typically\nis). If \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) is not finite, then\n\\(\\bigwedge_{i\\in\\mathcal{A}}K_{i}\\varphi\\) is not a formula in\n\\(\\mathcal{L}_{Kn}\\), as it has only finite conjunctions. As a\nshorthand for \\(\\bigwedge_{i\\in\\mathcal{A}}K_{i}\\varphi\\), it is\nstandard to introduce the everybody knows operator,\n\\(E_{G}\\): \n\\[E_{G}\\varphi:=\\bigwedge_{i\\in\\mathcal{A}}K_{i}\\varphi.\\]\n\n\nIn the three world model, \\(K_{a}p\\wedge K_{b}p\\), so\n\\(E_{\\{a,b\\}}p\\).\n\nThat everybody knows something does not mean that this knowledge is\nshared between the members of the group. The three world model\nexemplifies this: Though \\(E_{\\{a,b\\}}p\\), it also the case that\n\\(\\neg K_{b}E_{\\{a,b\\}}p\\).\n\nTo capture that there is no uncertainty in the group about \\(\\varphi\\)\nnor any higher-order uncertainty about \\(\\varphi\\) being\nknown by all agents, no formula in the language \\(\\mathcal{L}_{Kn}\\)\nis enough. Consider the formula \n\\[E_{G}^{k}\\varphi\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(E_{G}^{k}\\) is short for k iterations of the \\(E_{G}\\)\noperator. Then for no natural number k will the formula\n\\(E_{G}^{k}\\varphi\\) be enough: it could be the case that b\ndoesn\u2019t know it! To rectify this situation, one could try\n\n\\[\\bigwedge_{k\\in\\mathbb{N}}E_{G}^{k}\\varphi\\]\n\n\nbut this is not a formula as \\(\\mathcal{L}_{Kn}\\) only contains finite\nconjunctions.\n\nHence, though the \\(E_{G}\\) operator is definable in the language\n\\(\\mathcal{L}_{Kn}\\), a suitable notion of common knowledge\nis not. For that, we again need to define a new relation on our model.\nThis time, we are interested in capturing that nobody considers\n\\(\\varphi\\) epistemically possible anywhere. To build the\nrelation, we therefore first take the union the relations of all the\nagents in G, but this is not quite enough: to use the standard\nmodal semantic clause, we must also be able to reach all of the worlds\nin this relation in a single step. Hence, let\n\n\\[R_{G}^{C}:=\\left(\\bigcup_{i\\in G}R_{i}\\right)^{*}\\]\n\n\nwhere \\((\\cdotp)^{*}\\) is the operation of taking the reflecxive\ntransitive closure. If R is a relation, then \\((R)^{*}\\)\nis R plus the reflexive arrow and all the pairs missing to make\nR a transitive relation. Consider the three world model: With\nthe relation \\(\\bigcup_{i\\in\\{a,b\\}}R_{i}\\), we can reach \\(w_{3}\\)\nfrom \\(w_{1}\\) in two steps, stopping over at \\(w_{2}\\). With\n\\((\\bigcup_{i\\in\\{a,b\\}}R_{i})^{*}\\), \\(w_{3}\\) is reachable in one\nstep: By the newly added transitive link from \\(w_{1}\\) to\n\\(w_{3}\\).\n\nTo represent common knowledge, augment the Backus-Naur form\nof \\(\\mathcal{L}_{Kn}\\) with operators \n\\[C_{G}\\text{ for }G\\subseteq\\mathcal{A},\\]\n\n\nto make \\(C_{G}\\varphi\\) a well-formed formula. Evaluate such formulas\nby the semantic clause \n\\[(M,w)\\vDash C_{G}\\varphi\\text{ iff }(M,w')\\vDash\\varphi\\text{ for all }w'\\in W\\text{ such that }wR_{G}^{C}w'.\\]\n\n\nVarying the properties of the accessibility relations\n\\(R_{1},R_{2},\\ldots,R_{n}\\), as described above results in different\nepistemic logics. For instance, system K with common\nknowledge is determined by all frames, while system\nS4 with common knowledge is determined by all\nreflexive and transitive frames. Similar results can be obtained for\nthe remaining epistemic logics (Fagin et al. 1995, van Ditmarsch et\nal. 2007). For an informal discussion, consult\n the entry on common knowledge.\n4. Beyond Knowing That\n\nSo far, we have focused on know-that, the standard notion\nanalyzed in epistemic logic. However, as mentioned earlier, in natural\nlanguage, we also express knowledge in terms of know-wh, i.e., the\nverb \u201cknow\u201d followed by an embedded question, such as:\n\n\n\nAlice knows whether the claim is true. \n\n\nBob knows what the password is. \n\n\nCharlie knows how to prove the theorem. \n\n\nDave knows why Charlie knows how to prove the\ntheorem. \n\n\nLogical research on know-wh also dates back to Hintikka (1962), who\ndedicated a chapter to the formal account of know-who, and\nproposed to formalize other know-wh alike. According to\nHintikka, to know \u201cwho Mary is\u201d is to know the answer to\nthe corresponding question \u201cWho is Mary?\u201d. Essentially,\none must be able to identify the person denoted by the name\nMary (supposing it is a proper name). Therefore, it is a\npiece of de re knowledge, i.e., the knowledge of an\nobject. To render it formally, Hintikka treats \u201cBob\nknows who Mary is\u201d as \u201cthere is a person such that Bob\nknows that this person is Mary\u201d, which connects\nknow-that with know-wh by using quantification over objects. To\nexpress Hintikka\u2019s formalization, we need to extend our basic\nlanguage of propositional modal logic to first-order modal\nlogic, the modal logic with quantifiers and predicates. As\nanother example, \u201cBob knows who murdered Dave\u201d can be\nformalized in first-order epistemic logic as \\(\\exists x K_{\\Bob}\n\\Murder(x, \\Dave)\\). Note that the order of the quantifier and the\nknow-that modality is crucial to capture de re knowledge. The\nswapped de dicto version \\(K_{\\Bob} \\exists x\\Murder(x,\n\\Dave)\\) merely says \u201cBob knows that Dave is murdered\u201d.\nFor Hintikka, it is also important how the agent is identified, cf.\n(Hintikka & Symons 2003).\n\nSuch treatments of know-wh are also supported by a large body of\nresearch on the semantics of (embedded) questions in linguistics\n(e.g., Groenendijk & Stokhof 1982; Harrah 2002), and epistemology\nof knowledge-wh (e.g., Stanley & Williamson 2001). Linguists have\ndiscussed various readings of epistemic expressions with embedded\nquestions, in particular the so-called mention-some and\nmention-all interpretations. The mention-some interpretation\nrequires that one knows at least one (correct) answer in order to\npossess know-wh knowledge, while the mention-all interpretation\nrequires that one knows all the (correct) answers (cf. Groenendijk\n& Stokhof 1982). For example, a (strong) exhaustive mention-all\nreading for \u201cBob knows who came to the party\u201d is\nformalized by \\(\\forall x (K_{\\Bob} \\Came(x) \\lor K_{\\Bob}\\neg \\Came\n(x))\\) where \\(\\forall\\) replaces \\(\\exists\\) as the leading\nquantifier, contra the previous examples. The interpretation of\nknow-wh is also context-dependent in general, which introduces further\ncomplications (e.g., Aloni 2001, 2018). Coming back to logic, Hintikka\n(1962) discussed the notion of consistency in such a logic of know-who\nand various philosophical issues, such as trans-world identity. In his\nlatter work, Hintikka (2003) also made use of his Independent\nFriendly Logic to go beyond the first-order quantification, in\norder to capture wh-knowledge about higher-order entities, such as\n\u201cI know whom every young mother should trust\u201d with the\nintention of \u201ctrusting her own mother\u201d.\n\nAlthough Hintikka gave a basic semantics of know-wh, the systematical\nstudy of the epistemic logics of know-wh was not developed until\nrecently. This is partly due to the underdevelopment of first-order\nmodal logic, compared to its propositional brother (cf., Gochet &\nGribomont 2006 for a survey on first-order epistemic logic). Various\nwell-known systems of first-order modal logic do not enjoy the\ntechnically desirable properties of propositional modal logic, but\nsuffers incompleteness, undecidability and the failure of\ninterpolation (cf., Bra\u00fcner & Ghilardi 2007). In particular,\nit is very hard to find decidable fragments of first-order modal logic\nto make it computationally appealing (e.g., Hodkinson, Wolter, &\nZakharyaschev 2000).\n\nNevertheless, there are works on clarifying the de re and\nde dicto distinctions in the setting of quantified epistemic\nlogic (e.g., Grove 1995; Corsi & Orlandelli 2013; Holliday &\nPerry 2014; Occhipinti Liberman & Rendsvig 2022), and a number of\napplication-driven frameworks based on first-order epistemic logic\n(e.g., Mika Cohen & Dam 2007; Kaneko & Nagashima 1996; Sturm,\nWolter, & Zakharyaschev 2000; Belardinelli & Lomuscio 2011),\nalthough they are not directly about know-wh. As one of a few\nexceptions directly related to know-wh based on quantified modal\nlogic, Rendsvig (2012) discusses Frege\u2019s Puzzle about Identity\nin a framework where agents may have knowledge-who about the referents\nof proper names.\n\nAnother line of research directly related to know-who is based on\nterm-modal logic proposed by (Fitting, Thalmann, &\nVoronkov 2001), a variant of quantified modal logic where modalities\nare subscripted by terms instead of indexes. This allows\nformulas such as \\(\\exists y \\exists x K_{y} \\Murder(x, \\Dave)\\)\n(\u201cthere is someone that knows who murdered Dave\u201d), or\n\\(\\exists x K_{\\Bob}( \\Murder(x, \\Dave) \\wedge x = \\Adam)\\)\n(\u201cBob knows who murdered Dave and that is Adam\u201d). Starting\nfrom (Kooi 2007), various versions of (dynamic) term-modal logic were\nproposed to discuss know-who, such as Occhipinti Liberman, Achen,\n& Rendsvig 2020; and Y. Wang, Wei, & Seligman 2022. These are\ncloser to the original systems suggested by Hintikka (1962), where the\nnames of agents are also treated as terms. Term-modal logic\nformalization of know-who in social networks, and the dynamics that\ninfluence it, is a main theme in Occhipinti Liberman & Rendsvig\n2022. A few decidable fragments of term-modal logics were discovered\nin Orlandelli & Corsi 2017; Padmanabha & Ramanujam 2019a,\n2019b; and Occhipinti Liberman, Achen, and Rendsvig 2020, where a\nrecent review of the term-modal logic literature can be found.\n\nConcerning a different type of know-wh, some formal discussions on\nknow-how have appeared in the setting of strategy logics. It\nis observed that in the setting of Epistemic Alternating Temporal\nLogic, just combining \u201cknow\u201d and \u201ccan\u201d\ndoes not capture know-how (cf., Jamroga & van der Hoek 2004;\nHerzig 2015) but de dicto knowledge: I know there is some way\nto guarantee \\(\\varphi\\). Instead of explicitly using the quantifiers,\npeople introduced alternative semantics for the coalition operators in\nepistemic variants of ATL (e.g., Jamroga & \u00c5gotnes 2007;\nMaubert, Pinchinat, Schwarzentruber, & Stranieri 2020; Maubert,\nMurano, Pinchinat, Schwarzentruber, & Stranieri 2020).\n\nRecently, a know-wh first approach has emerged that treats\nknow-wh as an independent modality, just as the modality of know-that\n(cf. the survey by Y. Wang 2018b). The general motivation of this line\nof research is to focus on the logical behavior of each know-wh as a\nprimitive concept, rather than breaking it down in the syntax\ninto quantifiers, modalities, and predicates in the full language of\npredicate modal logic. This approach is inspired by the early work of\nPlaza 1989 and Ma & Guo 1983, where a \\(Kv\\) operator is\nintroduced to capture the notion of \u201cknowing the value of a\nconstant\u201d. Semantically, \\(Kv d\\) can be viewed as a\n\u201cbundle\u201d of \\(\\exists x K(d=x)\\), which says the agent\nknows what the value of \\(d\\) is. In this line of research,\nvarious languages were proposed with both the know-that operator and\nthe know-wh operator of certain types, whose semantics is given by the\nfirst-order modal interpretation, as we described above for the \\(Kv\\)\noperator.\n\nAs an example of a know-wh first framework, consider the\nfollowing epistemic language of (goal-directed) know-how and know-that\ndiscussed by Li & Wang (2021a), where \\(K\\!h_i\\varphi\\) says that\nagent \\(i\\) knows how to achieve the goal \\(\\varphi\\).\n\n\\[\\varphi::=p\\mid\\neg\\varphi\\mid (\\varphi\\land\\varphi)\\mid K_i\\varphi\\mid \n K\\!h_i\\varphi\\]\n\n\nThe semantics is given over a type of Kripke models with both\nepistemic relations \\(\\sim_i, i \\in \\mathcal{A}\\) and labeled action\nrelations \\(\\stackrel{a}{\\rightarrow}, a \\in \\Act\\), where\n\\(\\Act=\\cup_{i\\in \\mathcal{A}}\\Act_i\\) is the union of the sets of\nactions of each agent, which do not explicitly described in the formal\nlanguage. Such a model takes the form \\(\\mathcal{M}= (W,\\{\\sim_i\\}_{i\n\\in \\mathcal{A}}, \\{\\stackrel{a}{\\rightarrow}\\}_{a \\in \\Act},V)\\). The\nsatisfaction relation between a pointed Kripke model \\(\\mathcal{M},w\\)\nand a \\(K\\!h_i\\varphi\\) formula is given by the following \\(\\exists x\nK\\)-style schema:\n\n\n\n\\(\\mathcal{M},w\\vDash K\\!h_i\\varphi\\)\n\\(\\iff\\)\nthere is a plan \\(\\pi\\) such that for all \\(w'\n\\sim_i w\\):\n\n\n1.\n \\(\\pi\\) is strongly executable by \\(i\\) on \\(w'\\);\n2.\n \\(\\mathcal{M},v\\vDash\\varphi\\) for each final state \\(v\\)\nreachable by executing \\(\\pi\\).\n   \n\n\nA plan \\(\\pi\\) can have different forms, such as a finite linear\nsequence of actions, a conditional strategy given the knowledge of\nagents, or even a program with loops (cf., Li & Wang 2021b). A\nplan is strongly executable intuitively means the plan will\nnever get stuck and always terminates successfully.\n\nTo exemplify the framework, suppose that a patient is experiencing\nsome rare symptom \\(p\\). To know the cause (\\(q\\) or \\(\\neg q\\)),\nDoctor 1 suggests the patient first take a special test (\\(a\\)), which\nis only available at Doctor 1\u2019s hospital, and send the results\nto Doctor 2 in another city, who is more experienced in examining the\nresults. Doctor 2 will then know the cause, depending on which,\ndifferent medicines (\\(b\\) or \\(c\\)) should be subscribed to cure the\npatient. The situation is depicted below as a model with both\nepistemic relations (dotted lines labeled by \\(1,2\\); reflexive ones\nomitted) and action relations (solid lines labeled by \\(a,b,c\\)). Note\nthat only Doctor 1 can execute action \\(a\\), and only Doctor 2 can\nperform \\(b\\) or \\(c\\). After action \\(a\\), Doctor 2 knows whether she\nis at \\(w_3\\) or at \\(w_4\\), but Doctor 1 is still uncertain about\nit.\n\n\n\n\nIntuitively, Doctor 1 knows how to let Doctor 2 know how to cure the\npatient (\\(\\neg p\\)), although neither Doctor 1 nor Doctor 2 knows how\nto cure the patient alone. This can be expressed by \\(\\neg K\\!h_1 \\neg\np\\land \\neg K\\!h_2 \\neg p\\land K\\!h_1((K_2 q\\lor K_2\\neg q)\\land\nK\\!h_2 \\neg p)\\), which is true at \\(w_1\\) and \\(w_2\\), given a proper\nnotion of plans.\n\nFinally, logics of know-how may be obtained for this framework. The\naxioms depend on the specific assumptions made of the Kripke models,\nas in standard epistemic logic. For example, if we allow\nconditional knowledge-based plans and consider agents with\nperfect recall (as in Fervari, Herzig, Li, & Wang 2017),\nthen the following axioms and rules on top of the S5 proof system for\n\\(K_i\\) are complete:\n\n\n\n\\(\\mathtt{EMP}\\)\n\\(K_i p \\to K\\!h_i p\\)\n\\(\\mathtt{KhK}\\)\n\\(K\\!h_i p \\to K\\!h_i K_i p\\) \n\n\\(\\mathtt{KKh}\\)\n\\(K\\!h_i p \\to K_iK\\!h_i p\\)\n\\(\\mathtt{KhKh}\\)\n\\(K\\!h_i K\\!h_i p \\to K\\!h_i p\\) \n\n\\(\\mathtt{Khbot}\\)\n\\(\\neg K\\!h_i \\bot\\)\n\\(\\mathtt{MONOKh}\\)\n\\(\\dfrac{\\vdash\\varphi\\to\\psi}{K\\!h_i\\varphi\\to\nK\\!h_i\\psi}\\)  \n\n",
