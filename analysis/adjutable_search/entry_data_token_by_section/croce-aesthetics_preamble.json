    "main_text": "\n\nThe Neapolitan Benedetto Croce (1860\u20131952) was a dominant figure\nin the first half of the twentieth century in aesthetics and literary\ncriticism, and to lesser but not inconsiderable extent in philosophy\ngenerally. But his fame did not last, either in Italy or in the\nEnglish speaking world. He did not lack promulgators and willing\ntranslators into English: H. Carr was an early example of the former,\nR. G. Collingwood was perhaps both, and D. Ainslie did the latter\nservice for most of Croce\u2019s principal works. But his star\nrapidly declined after the Second World War. Indeed it is hard to find\na figure whose reputation has fallen so far and so quickly; this is\nsomewhat unfair not least because Collingwood\u2019s aesthetics is\nstill studied, when its many of its main ideas are often thought to\nhave been borrowed from Croce. The causes are a matter for\nspeculation, but two are likely. First, Croce\u2019s general\nphilosophy was very much of the preceding century. As the idealistic\nand historicist systems of Bradley, Green, and Joachim were in Britain\nsuperseded by Russell, Moore and Ayer, and analytical philosophy in\ngeneral, Croce\u2019s system was swept away by new ideas on the\ncontinent\u2014from Heidegger and Sartre on the one hand to\ndeconstructionism on the other. Second, Croce\u2019s manner of\npresentation in his famous early works now seems, not to put too fine\na point on it, dismissively dogmatic; it is full of the youthful\nconviction and fury that seldom wears well. On certain key points,\nopposing positions are characterized as foolish, or as confused\nexpressions of simple truths that only waited upon Croce to articulate\nproperly (yet his later exchange with John Dewey\u2014see Croce 1952,\nDouglas 1970, Vittorio 2012\u2014finds him more earnestly\naccountable). Of course, these dismissals carry some\nweight\u2014Croce\u2019s reading is prodigious and there is far more\ninsight beneath the words than initially meets the eye\u2014but\nunless the reader were already convinced that here at last is the\ntruth, their sheer number and vehemence will arouse mistrust. And\nsince the early works, along with his long running editorship of the\njournal La Critica, rocketed him to such fame and admiration,\nwhereas later years were devoted among other things to battling with\nwhile being tolerated by fascists, it\u2019s not surprising that he\nnever quite lost this habit.\n\nNevertheless, Croce\u2019s signal contribution to aesthetics\u2014an\ninteresting new angle on the idea that art is expression\u2014can be\nmore or less be detached from the surrounding philosophy and polemics.\nIn what follows, we will first see the doctrine as connected to its\noriginal philosophical context, then we will attempt to snip the\nconnections.\n",
