    "main_text": "The Challenge-Seeking View of Action\n3. The Challenge-Seeking View of Action\n\nActions, Katsafanas holds, are generated by drives. (Katsafanas 2013,\nch. 6; he attributes most of the elements of his view to Nietzsche,\nthis among them, but here we won\u2019t be concerned with whether the\nhistorical claim is correct.) So if there is a characteristic that\nactions must have insofar as they are generated by drives, then all\nactions have it. \n\nDrives are characterized by their aims \u2013 for instance, the aim of the\nshopping drive is having lots of stuff \u2013 and they generate objects\n(typically, objects of desire), which are formally a very different\nmatter. When an object is attained (continuing the illustration, when\nyou bring home that gewgaw from the craft fair), the desire for it\nevaporates, and you are satiated; but after a while, the drive\ngenerates a new object (now a garment, which seems to you a steal at\n30% off). Drives working this way, that is, generating one object of\ndesire after another, can be characterized more deeply as directed\ntoward encountering and overcoming resistance. \n\nNow actions are the products of choice, and often enough of\ndeliberation; when you deliberate, you take the outcome of\ndeliberation to settle what you are going to do. (If you did not, you\nwould merely be attempting to predict what you are going to do, in\njust the way you might attempt to predict the actions of other\npeople.) Even when deliberation is absent, choice involves assessment,\nand the assessment, whether deliberative or not, determines you to act\nonly if you approve of the action; therefore, actions aspire to be\nactive, where that means that you approve of what you do, and\nfurther, that if you understood what the motivational inputs to that\ndeliberative runup to the action really were, you\nwould continue to approve (Katsafanas 2013, ch. 5).   That last demand\ncovers all of those inputs, and not just the official ones (as when you claim to be weighing the pros and cons of a request, but are also responsive to the attractiveness, social class, or gender of the one making it). \n\nBecause actions are produced by drives, you can only be fully active\nif you approve of your drives\u2019 role; that in turn requires approving\nof the drives\u2019 primary structural feature, namely, their ongoing\nproduction of challenging goals. It follows that whenever we do\nsomething, we have (or aspire to have, if we are less than fully\nactive) a further aim (which, borrowing Nietzsche\u2019s vocabulary,\nKatsafanas dubs \u2018will to power\u2019): that of selecting and structuring\nour activities so that they involve challenges we will exert ourselves\nin meeting. \n\nAs in Velleman\u2019s view, the upshot is that your various reasons are\ninvariably accompanied by a further reason: not, as in Velleman\u2019s\ncase, wanting to know what you are doing and to understand yourself,\nbut rather an interest in choosing more rather than less challenging\n\u2013 but nonetheless attainable \u2013 objectives. Katsafanas takes this\ninterest to answer the complaint he directed at authorship views of\naction. If you approve of an aim, you want to achieve it to the\ngreatest extent possible; therefore, if you are active, you are\ncommitted to more rather than to less challenging activities.\n(Although this underwrites the contrast between having more and having\nless reason to do something, Katsafanas does not regard it as inducing\nthe commensurability of reasons across the board.) He also takes it to\nhave consequences for substantive moral theory; just for instance,\nbecause the struggle to overcome resistance involves suffering, that\nsort of suffering counts as a good thing. \n",
