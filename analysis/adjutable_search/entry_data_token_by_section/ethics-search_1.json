Search Engine Development and Evolution: A Short History\n\n\nBecause search engines provide Internet users with access to important\ninformation by directing them to links to available online resources\non a plethora of topics, many are inclined to see search engine\ntechnology in a positive light; some might also assume, as Noble\n(2018) and others note, that this technology is\n\u201cvalue-neutral.\u201d However, search engines can raise a\nnumber of ethical controversies. Before examining these controversies,\nhowever, we first briefly discuss the history of search engine\ntechnology via categories that, for our purposes, reflect four\ndistinct eras: (i) Pre-Internet, (ii) Internet (pre-Web), (iii) early\nWeb, and (iv) Web 2.0. We will see how technical developments in each\nera have had some implications for the cluster of ethical issues\nexamined in\nSection 3.\n",
