    "main_text": "The Critique of Traditional Aesthetics || Properties and Essence\n1.1 Properties and Essence\n\n\nIt is also vividly apparent from the outset of these lectures that\nWittgenstein is urging a heightened vigilance to the myriad ways in\nwhich words can, on their grammatical surface, mislead. If, right at\nthe beginning of the inquiry, we see that we use the word\n\u201cbeautiful\u201d as an adjective, we may well very shortly find\nourselves asking what is the essence of the property beauty\nthat this particular example exhibits. Imagining a book of philosophy\ninvestigating parts of speech (but very many more parts than we find\nin an ordinary grammar book) where we would give very detailed and\nnuanced attention to \u201cseeing\u201d, \u201cfeeling\u201d,\nalong with other verbs of personal experience, and equally lengthy\nstudies of \u201call\u201d, \u201cany\u201d, \u201csome\u201d,\nnumerals, first person pronoun usages, and so forth, he suggests that\nsuch a book would, with sufficient attention paid to the contextual\nintricacies of the grammar of each usage, lay bare the confusion into\nwhich language can lead us. Later, in his Philosophical\nInvestigations (Wittgenstein 1958), he will go on to famously\ndevelop the analogy between tools and language as a way of breaking\nthe hold of the conceptual picture that words work in one way (by\nnaming things\u2014including the naming of properties, as in the way\nwe too-quickly think of the problem of beauty above), showing the\ndiversity of kind and of use among the various\nthings we find in the tool box (e.g. hammer, glue, chisel,\nmatches). If we redirect our attention, away from the id\u00e9e\nfixe of the puzzle concerning the common property named by the\nword \u201cbeauty\u201d or the description \u201cbeautiful\u201d,\nand look to the actual use to which our aesthetic-critical vocabulary\nis put, we will see that it is not some intrinsic meaning carried\ninternally by the linguistic sign (Wittgenstein 1958a) that makes the\nword in question function as an aesthetic or critical interjection or\nexpression of approval. We will, rather, be able to focus our\nredirected attention on what actually does make the word in question\nfunction aesthetically, i.e. \u201con the enormously complicated\nsituation in which the aesthetic expression has a place\u201d, and he\nadds that, with such an enlarged vision, we see that \u201cthe\nexpression itself has almost a negligible place\u201d (p. 2). He here\nmentions (seeing aesthetic issues as interwoven with the rest of\nphilosophy) that if he had to identify the main mistake made in\nphilosophical work of his generation, it would be precisely that of,\nwhen looking at language, focusing on the form of words, and not the\nuse made of the form of words. He will go on to imply, if not quite to\ndirectly assert, that the parallel holds to the work of art: to see it\nwithin a larger frame of reference, to see it in comparison to other\nworks of the artist in question and to see it juxtaposed with still\nother works from its cultural context, is to see what role itplayed in\nthe dialogically unfolding artistic\n \u201clanguage-game\u201d[1]\n of its time and place. In using language, he says next in the\nlectures, in understanding each other\u2014and in mastering a\nlanguage initially\u2014we do not start with a small set of words or\na single word, but rather from specific occasions and activities. Our\naesthetic engagements are occasions and activities of just this kind;\nthus aesthetics, as a field of conceptual inquiry, should start not\nfrom a presumption that the central task is to analyze the determinant\nproperties that are named by aesthetic predicates, but rather with a\nfull-blooded consideration of the activities of aesthetic\nlife.\n",
