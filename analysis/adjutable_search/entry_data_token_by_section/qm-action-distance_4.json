    "main_text": "Action at a distance, holism and non-separability || Holism\n4.2 Holism\n\n\nIn the literature, there are various characterizations of holism.\nDiscussions of quantum non-locality frequently focus on property\nholism, where certain physical properties of objects are not determined\nby the physical properties of their parts. The intuitive idea is that\nsome intrinsic properties of wholes (e.g. physical systems) are not\ndetermined by the intrinsic properties of their parts and the\nspatiotemporal relations that obtain between these parts. This idea can\nbe expressed in terms of supervenience relations.\n\nProperty Holism. Some objects have intrinsic\nqualitative properties and/or relations that do not supervene upon the\nintrinsic qualitative properties and relations of their parts and the\nspatiotemporal relations between these parts.\n\n\nIt is difficult to give a general precise specification of the terms\n\u2018intrinsic qualitative property\u2019 and\n\u2018supervenience.\u2019 Intuitively, a property of an object is\nintrinsic just in case that object has this property in and for itself\nand independently of the existence or the state of any other object. A\nproperty is qualitative (as opposed to individual) if it does not\ndepend on the existence of any particular object. And the intrinsic\nqualitative properties of an object O supervene upon the\nintrinsic qualitative properties and relations of its parts and the\nspatiotemporal relations between them just in case there is no change\nin the properties and relations of O without a change in the\nproperties and relations of its parts and/or the spatiotemporal\nrelations between them. (For attempts to analyze the term\n\u2018intrinsic property,\u2019 see for example Langton and Lewis\n1998 and the entry on intrinsic vs. extrinsic properties. For a review\nof different types of supervenience, see for example Kim 1978,\nMcLaughlin 1994 and the entry on supervenience.)\n\n\nPaul Teller (1989, p. 213) proposes a related notion of holism,\n\u2018relational holism,\u2019 which is characterized as the\nviolation of the following condition:\n\nParticularism. The world is composed of\nindividuals. All individuals have non-relational properties and all\nrelations supervene on the non-relational properties of the\nrelata.\n\n\nHere, by a non-relational property Teller means an intrinsic property\n(1986a, p. 72); and by \u2018the supervenience of a relational\nproperty on the non-relational properties of the relata,\u2019 he\nmeans that \u2018if two objects, 1 and 2, bear a relation R\nto each other, then, necessarily, if two further objects,\n1\u2032 and 2\u2032 have the same non-relational properties, then\n1\u2032 and 2\u2032 will also bear the same relation R to\neach other\u2019 (1989, p. 213). Teller (1986b, pp.  425-7) believes\nthat spatiotemporal relations between objects supervene upon the\nobjects\u2019 intrinsic physical properties. Thus, he does not\ninclude the spatiotemporal relations in the supervenience basis.  This\nview is controversial, however, as many believe that spatiotemporal\nrelations between objects are neither intrinsic nor supervene upon the\nintrinsic qualitative properties of these objects.  But, if such\nsupervenience does not obtain, particularism will also be violated in\nclassical physics, and accordingly relational holism will fail to mark\nthe essential distinction between the classical and the quantum\nrealms. Yet, one may slightly revise Teller's definition of\nparticularism as follows:\n\nParticularism*. The world is composed of\nindividuals. All individuals have non-relational properties and all\nrelations supervene upon the non-relational properties of the relata\nand the spatiotemporal relations between them.\n\n\nIn what follows in this entry, by relational holism we shall mean a\nviolation of particularism*.\n",
