    "main_text": "Liberationism\n3. Liberationism\n\nThe first claim in the defence of the denial of rights to children is\nthat children are disqualified by virtue of their incapacity to have\nrights. Liberationists dispute this. Liberationists can allow that the\nkey to the appropriateness of giving or not giving rights to children\nturns on capacity (Cohen 1980, ix). They will argue, however, that\nchildren are not disqualified from having rights by virtue of their\nlack of a capacity that adults do have. Note that on this view\nchildren are entitled to both welfare and freedom rights whereas those\nwho concede that children lack the latter in virtue of a certain\nincapacity can still insist that they ought to have welfare rights\nwhere such an incapacity is not relevant. There are two respects in\nwhich this liberationist case might be modified or qualified. The\nfirst is in its scope. The liberationist might claim that all children\nare qualified to have rights, or she might claim only that some\nchildren are so qualified. The latter is the more plausible position\nin view of the fact that the very young infant is evidently\nincapacitated. Indeed some liberationists seem to recognise as much\neven whilst they insist that every child should have rights (Farson\n1974, 31, 172, and 185). If the scope of the liberationist claim is\nthus limited it does not amount to the view that no line dividing\nhuman rights holders from humans who lack rights should be drawn.\nRather it is the view that such a line has been drawn in the wrong\nplace.\n\nA second possible qualification of the liberationist view is that\ngiving rights to children will play an important part in their\nacquiring the qualifying capacity. It is not thus argued that children\nare capable now and are illegitimately denied their rights. It is\nrather that they will only\u2014or at least will more readily or will\nat an earlier stage\u2014acquire that capacity if given their rights.\nThe denial of rights to children is, on this account, one significant\nelement in a culture that serves artificially to maintain children in\ntheir childlike state of dependence, vulnerability, and immaturity.\nAgain the qualification can concede that children of a very young age\nare not capable enough to have rights, and will not acquire that\ncapacity even if given rights. Yet it insists that the denial of\nrights to children of a certain age on account of their alleged\nincapacity is simply self-confirming. They cannot have rights because\nthey are incapable but they are incapable only because they do not\nhave these rights.\n\nOne plausible version of the claim refers to the facts of experience.\nChildren, or at least children of a certain age, may not differ\nmarkedly from adults in respect of their cognitive and volitional\ncapacities. They may be as capable as older humans of making their own\nminds up about what to do and be as independent in their resolution to\nact on their choices. But they may simply not have had as much\nexperience of the world as their adult counterparts. Being thus\nna\u00efve and inexperienced in the ways of the world they will not be\nas able, that is as qualified, as older (and wiser) humans are to make\nsensible choices. Grant that such a lack of experience can be\nattributed to a lack of opportunities to exercise choice. If such a\nlack of opportunity is in turn attributable not simply to not having\nbeen around for as long but to a denial of the freedom to make their\nown choices, then there is a powerful case for liberty rights being\nextended, even if cautiously, to these young people.\n\nThere are different ways in which the liberationist claim about\ncapacity\u2014whether qualified or not\u2014can be made. One is by\ndefending a \u2018thin\u2019 definition of capacity. For example it\nmay be said that children can make choices if what this means is\nexpressing preferences. Of course the response is that the ability to\nchoose, thus minimally defined, is indeed possessed by children (even\nfairly young children), but it is not a capacity sufficient to qualify\nfor rights ownership. What is needed for that is more than simply the\nability to express or communicate a desire; what is needed is an\nability to understand and appreciate the significance of the options\nfacing one together with independence of choice. After all, the animal\nwho moves from one feeding bowl to another may be said thereby to\n\u2018choose\u2019 the food in the latter bowl. But the animal does\nnot have a general capacity of choice sufficient to qualify it as a\nholder of liberty rights.\n",
