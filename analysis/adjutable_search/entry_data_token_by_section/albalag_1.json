    "main_text": "Logic\n2. Logic\n\nThe first part of the Tiqqun (Logic) is, more or less, a\nfaithful translation of the Maq\u0101\u1e63id. Although this\npart is generally unoriginal, it may still be credited with a specific\ncontribution. Manuscripts of the Tiqqun include a sympathetic\ndiscussion of the fourth figure of syllogism. This figure was\nattributed by most Medieval logicians to Galen, though this\nattribution remains disputed in modern scholarship (Rescher 1965;\nSabra 1965), and was dismissed as lacking utility and\n\u201cnaturalness\u201d (see Gersonides Sefer ha-heqqesh\nha-Yashar  [The Book of the Correct Syllogism]: 147). It is not\nclear, however, whether Albalag himself wrote this discussion or\nwhether it was written by Abner of Burgos, a thirteenth-century\nJewish-convert-to-Christianity philosopher, as suggested by some\ntextual evidence (Vajda 1960: 275\u2013276).  In any case, the\ninclusion of this discussion in the Tiqqun independently of\nany explicit criticism indicates that Albalag agrees with its positive\nattitude towards the fourth figure of syllogism.\n\nThe Aristotelian syllogism does not determine a specific order for the\nmajor and minor premises. Hence, the terms comprising the premises,\nthe \u201cunique major\u201d and \u201cminor\u201d terms and the\nshared middle term, may be arranged in three possible figures as\nfollows: \n\n in the first figure, the middle term is subject in one premise\nand predicate in the other, \n in the second, it is subject in both premises, and \n in the third, it is predicate in both (Manekin 1996: 50).\n\n\nSome later logicians distinguished the order of the major and minor\npremises with the result that the first figure was divided into two\nfigures: \n\nin the first, the middle term is the subject in the minor and\npredicate in the major premises, and \n in the second, it is the subject in the major and the predicate\nin the minor premises (ibid, 1996: 50). \n\n\nThe additional fourth figure \u201cis sometimes placed after the\nfirst figure, rather than the third\u201d (ibid, 1996: 50).\n\nThe Tiqqun provides a quasi-defense of the fourth figure as a\n\u201cvaluable\u201d form of reasoning (Tiqqun n.5:12).\nThis interrupts Albalag\u2019s overall adherence to Averroes who,\nlike the majority of Medieval logicians, rejects the fourth figure due\nto considerations that have to do with \u201cnaturalness.\u201d\nAccording to Averroes, \u201cthe form of reasoning embodied in the\nfourth figure of syllogism does not exist in us by nature\u201d and\ninvolves \u201cabsurd self-predication\u201d (Manekin 1996: 56). In\nHebrew logical writings, limited attempts were advanced to establish\nthe validity of that figure, most famously by Gersonides. The\ndiscussion in the Tiqqun is another attempt to this effect\nwhere the author, interestingly, subjects even Aristotle to criticism\nfor omitting this form of reasoning (Tiqqun n.5: 12).\n",
