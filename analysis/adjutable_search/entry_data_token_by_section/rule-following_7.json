    "main_text": "The Sceptical Solution || An Alternate Form of Factualism\n3.3 An Alternate Form of Factualism\n\nWilson takes the lesson of the sceptical argument to be not that there\nare no meaning facts, but rather that a certain conception of such\nfacts, which he calls classical realism, is hopeless, and\nconceives of the sceptical solution as accommodating meaning facts\nwhen conceived in a different way (Wilson 1994; see also Wright 1992:\nchapter 6). Classical realism is sometimes referred to as semantic\nplatonism, the view that \u201cthe meanings of our words are\nguaranteed by the pre-existing structure of reality\u201d (Pears\n1988: 363; cf. Child 2001, Verheggen 2003, Zalabardo 2003, Hanks\n2017). What is essential to classical realism or semantic platonism is\nthat the properties that guarantee meaningfulness must be antecedently\nsingled out by individuals (or communities) in order to endow their\nwords with semantic standards (Wilson 1994 [2002: 251]). As Zalabardo\nputs it, what is required is \n\n\na conscious act in which I decide to pair the predicate with the\nproperty in such a way that the satisfaction conditions of the\npredicate, as I mean it, are determined by the instantiation\nconditions of the property. (2003: 314) \n\n\nWilson takes the sceptical challenge to reveal that no sense can be\nmade of this idea, for it is not possible for an individual (or\ncommunity) non-linguistically to single out properties as \u201cthe\nde re subject of her meaning-constituting intentions\u201d\n(1998: 105). But, to repeat, what this allegedly shows is not that\nthere are no meaning facts, but rather that we must reform our\nconception of them.\n\nThe alternative picture of meaning that Wilson fleshes out conceives\nof expressions as not connected to properties that serve as\n\u201cpre-established\u201d standards of correctness\u201d (2003:\n181\u2013182), and suggests that \u201cwhat we mean by [an\nexpression] is something that gets settled only over the course of\ntime\u201d (2003: 186). In response to Wilson\u2019s proposal, it\nhas been argued that it is susceptible to collapsing into a form of\nsubjectivism (Kremer 2000), and that it is untenable, for it falls\nprey to the sceptical challenge that it purports to bypass (Miller\n2010b). It has also been argued, contra Wilson, that classical realism\nis merely an instance of a more general conception of meaning that\ntakes standards of correctness to be determined by\nentities\u2014whether abstract properties or real features of the\nworld around us\u2014that are considered independently of how we\nmight describe them linguistically; it is this conception that must be\nrejected, as it is ultimately responsible for generating the paradox\n(Verheggen\n 2003).[9]\n",
