    "main_text": "History and Class Consciousness || Standpoint Theory and Revolution\n3.2 Standpoint Theory and Revolution\n\nIn the \u201cReification\u201d essay, Luk\u00e1cs is one of the\nfirst authors defending what has later come to be called a\n\u201cstandpoint theory\u201d and thereby has become an important\nforerunner especially of models in feminist epistemology (Jameson\n2009).\n\nIn particular, Luk\u00e1cs argues that the position of the\nproletariat is one of epistemic advantage concerning the acquisition\nof knowledge about society. Both the proletariat and the bourgeoisie\nare confronted, Luk\u00e1cs argues, with a reified social reality\n(1923a: 164). They will therefore form correct beliefs about this\nreality, but only insofar as they understand it in the form in which\nit is immediately (\u201cunvermittelt\u201d) given to them.\nThis is contrasted by Luk\u00e1cs to a different understanding which\nrealizes that the nature of all the individual elements of social\nreality is ultimately to be explained in terms of their role and\nrelationships within the totality of society, which is governed by the\ncommodity form as its structuring principle. Although the\n\u201cempiricist\u201d beliefs that are immediately accessible to\nall members of society are thus not strictly speaking false, they are\nincomplete, insofar as they are insufficient to comprehend the\nultimate nature of social phenomena, and they are misleading, insofar\nas theorists will tend, on the basis of these beliefs, to adopt\nfurther, false beliefs about that nature. Luk\u00e1cs emphatically\ndoes not state, however, that the proletariat, merely in virtue of its\nsocial position, has access to this superior understanding, but that\nthe proletariat is capable of achieving it. While the bourgeoisie must\nremain \u201cimprisoned within this immediacy\u201d (1923a, 147),\nthe proletariat is \u201cforced\u201d to go beyond it.\n\nWhich feature of the proletariat\u2019s existence gives rise to this\nadvantage is a matter of interpretive disagreement. While many later\nforms of feminist standpoint theories assume that social positions\ngive rise to epistemic opportunities in virtue of the distinctive\nexperiences they make available that are positively contributing to\nacquiring knowledge (see, for example, Jaggar 1983, 371, Smith 1974,\n7), other feminist authors, such as Hartsock (1983), draw on the idea\nthat the distinctive proletarian standpoint might be one that is\ncloser to use-value than exchange value, since workers have to\ninteract more directly with material objects, rather than just\nexchanging them. While some authors (such as Jameson 2009) also read\nLuk\u00e1cs as endorsing the claim that it is the distinctive\nexperience that members of the proletariat have which gives rise to a\nhigher probability of forming correct beliefs, more recent\ninterpretations (see Teixeira 2020, Feinberg 2020) emphasize that\nLuk\u00e1cs characterizes the experience of workers as identical to\nthat of members of the bourgeoisie. However, whereas the latter can\nintegrate that experience into a consistent self-understanding, in the\ncase of workers, the experience of society as something alien and\nobjective includes understanding themselves and their own activities.\nIn Luk\u00e1cs\u2019s words, the worker \u201cappears to himself\nimmediately as an object and not as the active part of the social\nprocess of labour\u201d (1923a, 167). The epistemic privilege of the\nproletariat is not rooted in the fact that this experience would make\nsome truth accessible to them, but rather in the fact that this\nnecessitates workers to acquire a \u201cbifurcated\nconsciousness\u201d of themselves as subject and as pure objects\nwhich is inconsistent and thus drives them beyond accepting reality as\nit appears immediately. Therefore, the distinctive epistemic position\nof the proletariat is not that it is uniquely situated in a way that\nis conducive to forming correct beliefs, but that it is uniquely\nsituated in a way that makes it increasingly difficult to continue to\nhold a set of true beliefs that restrict themselves to immediate\nappearances.\n\nThe epistemic possibility of gaining insight into the mediated nature\nof social phenomena, however, cannot be realized merely by individual\nproletarians revising their beliefs. Ultimately, the epistemically\nsuperior perspective is one in which the proletariat not merely\ndiscovers this nature, but also discovers itself, as the collective\nauthor of the structures of social reality. By realizing that it is\nthe \u201csubject-object of history\u201d, the proletariat discovers\nitself to be the subject of the process of social\nreproduction (see 1923a: 181; Jay 1984: 107f). As Luk\u00e1cs\nwrites, this \u201cact of consciousness overthrows the objective form\nof its object\u201d (1923a: 178). The proletariat can thus overcome\nreification only through a practical engagement with totality\u2014by\nconsciously transforming reality into the product of the\nproletariat\u2019s collective action\u2014which this totality in\nits essence has always already been. This process is, in\nLuk\u00e1cs\u2019 mind, nothing other than the communist revolution. As\nmany critics of Luk\u00e1cs have remarked (Adorno 1973: 190f., Bewes\n2002; Jay 1984; Rose 2009), this seems to commit Luk\u00e1cs to the\nview that there can be a complete overcoming of reification resulting\nin a totally transparent society. However, this interpretation\ndownplays Luk\u00e1cs\u2019 insistence that the resistance against\nreification must be understood as a never-ending struggle (see 1923a:\n199, 206; Feenberg 2011; Feenberg 2014: 116; L\u00f3pez 2019).\n\nAs Luk\u00e1cs\u2019 essay on the \u201cProblem of Organisation\u201d\n(1923b, written shortly before the reification essay) shows, the\ndistinction between \u201cempirical\u201d and \u201cimputed\u201d\nclass consciousness had not entirely been resolved by the introduction\nof a dialectics of consciousness that is supposed to ground the\nspontaneous process that is to lead the proletariat beyond immediacy.\nNon-reified consciousness remains only an objective possibility,\nalways threatened by the seductions of the immediate consciousness.\n\n\nThis has political consequences, as it seems to establish that the\ncommunist party has the function of expressing and disciplining the\nalready achieved forms of consciousness. This does not lead\nLuk\u00e1cs to endorse the Leninist party conception, however,\nmainly because Lenin\u2019s vision of politics is incompatible with\nhis radical criticism of bureaucracy in the reification essay (Arato\nand Breines 1979: 154). In his political writings immediately\npreceding History and Class Consciousness, Luk\u00e1cs\nrather seems to endorse at different points either a qualified\nLuxemburgian view of proletarian spontaneity (for example in 1920b)\nor an elitist conception of party vanguardism (a \u201cparty\nmyth\u201d, Arato and Breines 1979: 145), not arriving at an overall\nconsistent position on this question.\n",
