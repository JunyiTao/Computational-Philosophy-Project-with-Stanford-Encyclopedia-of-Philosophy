    "main_text": "Scope\n2. Scope\n\nWhat is the scope of public reason? To which topics or domains of\nmoral and political life does the idea of public reason apply? On\nRawls\u2019s influential account, the idea of public reason applies\nto what he calls the constitutional essentials and matters of\nbasic justice within a liberal democratic society, \u201cbut not\nin general for all the questions for all the questions to be settled\nby the legislature within a constitutional framework\u201d (Rawls\n2001, 91). Rawls suggests that \u201ccitizens and legislators may\nproperly vote their more comprehensive views when constitutional\nessentials and matters of basic justice are not stake; they need not\njustify by public reason why they vote as they do\u201d (Rawls 1996,\n235). Constitutional essentials, for Rawls, include: the principles\nthat structure the government and political process (e.g. rules\ndetermining who may vote, and whether a system is parliamentary or\npresidential), and the basic rights and liberties of citizens (Rawls\n1996, 227). Matters of basic justice involve principles regulating the\ndistribution of important resources (e.g. income, wealth) not covered\nby the list of basic rights and liberties (Rawls 1996,\n228\u2013229).\n\nThis proposal about the scope of public reason has been subject to two\nmain challenges. First, some doubt that there is a coherent way of\ndrawing the distinction between constitutional essentials and matters\nof basic justice on the one hand, and matters of ordinary political\nlegislation on the other (Greenawalt 1994, 685\u201386). Almost\neverything the government chooses to do (or not to do) would seem to\nhave an impact, even if indirect, on the basic rights and liberties of\ncitizens, or else on the distribution of resources in society. Second,\nassuming a satisfactory answer to the first question is possible; we\ncan ask why public reason should be restricted in the way Rawls\nproposes? Why not extend public reason to all instances where citizens\nexercise political power over one another? Rawls offers no\nwell-developed answer to this question, though a number of possible\narguments can be found in his work. These arguments appeal either to\nthe special importance of the basic structure of society, or\nto the basic interests of citizens, or to the importance of\npublic reason being complete, that is, of being capable of\ngenerating at least one determinate answer to important political\nquestions. But some deny any of these arguments, or some conjunction\nof them, can in fact justify restricting the scope of public reason to\nconstitutional essentials and matters of basic justice (Quong 2011,\n273\u2013289. But see Neufeld 2022, 59\u201360; and Watson and Hartley\n2018, 62\u201387 for defenses of the narrow scope view).\n\nAn alternative view\u2014derived from the account of respect and\ncoercion discussed in sect. 1.3\u2014expands the scope of public\nreason to cover all instances where some person or group exercises\ncoercive power over another person or group (Larmore 1996, 137;\nLarmore 1999, 607\u2013608; Nagel 1991, 159). On this view, the scope\nof public reason extends to almost all state action and activity,\nsince the state\u2019s actions are backed by coercive power, but it\nwill also extend to include the non-political use of coercion by\nprivate actors. Although this account may seem more clearly defined,\nit is also vulnerable to the charge of being both over and under\ninclusive. It seems underinclusive, as mentioned in sect. 1.3, because\nsome state activities are expressive or symbolic, rather than\ncoercive, but may still seem to stand in need of public justification.\nBut it may also seem overinclusive because private individuals\nsometimes exercise coercive power over one other in contexts (e.g.\nprivate associations or the workplace) where the idea of public reason\nmay seem inappropriate.\n\nFinally, an even broader account extends the scope of public reason to\nthe whole of social morality, that is, \u201cthe set of social-moral\nrules that require or prohibit action, and so ground moral imperatives\nthat we direct to each other to engage in, or refrain from, certain\nlines of conduct\u201d (Gaus 2011, 2). On this view, the idea of\npublic reason ought to apply whenever we purport to have the standing\nto tell others how they ought to behave. Being the most ambitious\nconception of the scope of public reason, this view is naturally\nvulnerable to worries that it is too expansive, including parts of\nmorality that are in fact governed by different standards (e.g.\nreligious standards of conduct). As noted in sect. 1.1, it is also an\naccount that depends on a particular philosophical conception of\nepistemology and moral psychology.\n",
