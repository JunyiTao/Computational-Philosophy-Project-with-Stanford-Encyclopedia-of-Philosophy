    "main_text": "Moral Philosophy\n3. Moral Philosophy\n\nPufendorf\u2019s ethical voluntarism is articulated through the\nnotion of \u201cmoral entities\u201d (entia moralia,\nderived from Weigel), to which most of EJU Book I is devoted (R\u00f6d\n1969, Kobusch 1996, Lutterbeck 2009, Hunter 2019). Moral entities specify the basic\nterms, concepts, categories, distinctions, and classifications \u2013\nin a sense, the metaethical grammar and vocabulary \u2013 out of\nwhich shared moral discourse is constituted. Conversely, they\ndesignate the ontological correlates or referents of this discourse,\nwhich are reliant on and yet distinct from the merely physical beings\nor settings in which they actually inhere. (See Statu #1, 1990, pp.\n83\u201384, 109\u201310), for the compositional metaphor.) Much of\nthe machinery of moral entities was carried forward from the EJU to\nDJN where, after being formally elaborated in the early chapters, it\nclearly structures the whole work.\n",
