    "main_text": "\n\nThe Buddhist philosopher Vasubandhu (4th to 5th\ncentury C.E.) was a great light at the peak of India\u2019s\nresplendent Gupta\n empire.[1]\n His works display his mastery of Buddhist as well as non-Buddhist\nthought of the day, and he made his mark, successively, upon three\nBuddhist scholastic traditions that are traditionally considered\ndistinct: Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika, Sautr\u0101ntika, and\n Yog\u0101c\u0101ra.[2]\n His master work of Abhidharma thought, the Commentary on the\nTreasury of the Abhidharma\n(Abhidharmako\u015babh\u0101\u1e63ya), is to this day the\nprimary resource for knowledge of \u201c\u015ar\u0101vaka\u201d or\nnon-Mah\u0101y\u0101na philosophy among Tibetan and East Asian\nBuddhist\n schools.[3]\n His concise works on Yog\u0101c\u0101ra philosophy set a new standard\nfor that school, which became mainstream Buddhist metaphysics in India\nfor half a millennium\n thereafter.[4]\n Venerated as he is across the Buddhist world, he has always been a\nsubject of disputation. This article will sketch his contested\nbiography and works, and provide summary analyses of his most\nprominent\n arguments.[5]\n",
