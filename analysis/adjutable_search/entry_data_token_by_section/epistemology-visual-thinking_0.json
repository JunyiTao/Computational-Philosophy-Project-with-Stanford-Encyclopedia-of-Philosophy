    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\nVisual thinking is a feature of mathematical practice across many\nsubject areas and at many levels. It is so pervasive that the question\nnaturally arises: does visual thinking in mathematics have any\nepistemically significant roles? A positive answer begets further\nquestions. Can we rationally arrive at a belief with the generality\nand necessity characteristic of mathematical theorems by attending to\nspecific diagrams or images? If visual thinking contributes to warrant\nfor believing a mathematical conclusion, must the outcome be an\nempirical belief? How, if at all can visual thinking contribute to\nunderstanding abstract mathematical subject matter?\nVisual thinking includes thinking with external visual\nrepresentations (e.g., diagrams, symbol arrays, kinematic computer\nimages) and thinking with internal visual imagery; often the\ntwo are used in combination, as when we are required to visually\nimagine a certain spatial transformation of an object represented by a\ndiagram on paper or on screen. Almost always (and perhaps always)\nvisual thinking in mathematics is used in conjunction with non-visual\nthinking. Possible epistemic roles include contributions to evidence,\nproof, discovery, understanding and grasp of concepts. The kinds and\nthe uses of visual thinking in mathematics are numerous and diverse.\nThis entry will deal with some of the topics in this area that have\nreceived attention and omit others. Among the omissions is the\npossible explanatory role of visual representations in\nmathematics. The topic of explanation within pure mathematics is\ntricky and best dealt with separately; for this an excellent starting\nplace is the entry on\n explanation in mathematics\n (Mancosu 2011). Two other omissions are the\ndevelopment of logic diagrams (Euler, Venn, Pierce and Shin) and the\nnature and use of geometric diagrams in Euclid\u2019s\nElements, both of which are well treated in the entry\n diagrams (Shin et al. 2013).  The\nfocus here is on visual thinking generally, which includes thinking\nwith symbol arrays as well as with diagrams; there will be no attempt\nhere to formulate a criterion for distinguishing between symbolic and\ndiagrammatic thinking. However, the use of visual thinking in proving\nand in various kinds of discovery will be covered in what\nfollows. Discussions of some related questions and some studies of\nhistorical cases not considered here are to be found in the collection\nDiagrams in Mathematics: History and Philosophy (Mumma and\nPanza 2012).\n",
