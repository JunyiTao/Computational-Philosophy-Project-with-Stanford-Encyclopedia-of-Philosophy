    "main_text": "Distal Theories of Sounds || Sounds as Properties\n3.1 Sounds as Properties\n\nAccording to the Property View sounds are properties of material\nobjects just like colors and shapes.\n\nThe property view is in part endorsed by the founding fathers of\nmodern philosophy of perception, Galileo and Locke, who opened a\ntradition of lumping various sensory items in the class of secondary\nqualities. The typical seventeenth century list of secondary qualities\nincludes colors, smells and sounds. No significant internal\nmetaphysical differentiation is made within the class of sensory\nqualities, hence the charge of an oversimplification cannot be\ndirectly addressed to historical accounts. Other philosophers may have\nadded shapes to the list (as Berkeley did), without addressing the\nissue of the homogeneity of the class: the issue was only whether\nshapes are secondary as sounds are, not whether they are on a par with\nsounds as to their structure.\n\nThe Property View has contemporary endorsers (Pasnau 1999; although\nPasnau takes sounds to be properties like colors, he comes close to\nthe event view when he writes that sounds \u201ceither are the\nvibrations of [objects that have sounds], or supervene on those\nvibrations\u201d [1999: 316]; indeed Pasnau 2007 rejoined the Event\nTheory). Leddington (2019) also defends a property view of sound\nwithin a distal view positions, since he claims that sound itself is\nnot an event but it is a property of the event which is producing it\n(i.e., a property of the collision).\n\nThe property view faces a number of objections. First, we ordinarily\ndescribe objects as \u201chaving\u201d colors or shapes, but we do\nnot ordinarily describe sources as \u201chaving sounds\u201d.\n\nRather, we say that they make or produce sounds (conversely, a red\ntable does not \u201cproduce\u201d or \u201cmake\u201d red). This\nis an ordinary language argument, and as such it might not be very\nstrong.\n\nThe main consideration against the Property View is that it\nunderestimates the important differences between colors and shapes on\nthe one hand, and sounds on the other hand. The latter, unlike the\nformer, are dynamic dependent individuals. And even if colors and\nshapes can be theoretically conceived as individuals, they are not\ndynamic. Sounds take up time. They start and cease. They are\nintrinsically temporal entities. Their temporal profile is essential\nto individuating them, in a way which has no analogue in the case of\ncolors and shapes. However, Roberts (2017) explicitly defends the\nProperty View by discussing salient disanalogies between sound and\ncolors. He also suggests a very exhaustive taxonomy of the different\npositions available within the property view space. Cohen (2010),\nalthough not directly endorsing the property view, criticizes\narguments that conclude to an asymmetry between sounds and colors, in\nparticular with regard to temporality.\n\nDi Bona and Santarcangelo (2018: chapter 4) discuss to a certain\nlength the relationship between sound and time, especially when this\nrelationship grounds a metaphysical difference between sounds and\ncolors. They investigate different temporal experiences of sounds and\nconclude that temporal experiences of sounds are similar to some\ntemporal experiences of colors. Sounds and colors differ with regard\nto temporality only insofar as one focuses on the role that time plays\nwhen the auditory system has to segregate auditory stimuli into\nauditory streams (Bregman 1990). When segregating colors, space is far\nmore important than time. For a discussion of vision and audition with\nregard not only to sounds and colors but also to auditory and visual\nobjects and always with relation to spatiality and temporality (see\nO\u2019Callaghan 2008; Kubovy & Schutz 2010; and Di Bona &\nSantarcangelo 2017).\n",
