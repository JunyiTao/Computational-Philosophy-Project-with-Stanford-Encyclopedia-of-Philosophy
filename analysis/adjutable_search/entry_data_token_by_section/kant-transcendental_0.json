The Transcendental Deduction\n\nThe Transcendental Deduction (A84\u2013130, B116\u2013169) is\nKant\u2019s attempt to demonstrate against empiricist psychological\ntheory that certain a priori concepts correctly apply to\nobjects featured in our experience. Dieter Henrich (1989) points out\nthat Kant\u2019s use of \u2018Deduktion\u2019 redeploys\nGerman legal vocabulary; in Holy Roman Empire Law,\n\u2018Deduktion\u2019 signifies an argument intended to\nyield a historical justification for the legitimacy of a property\nclaim. In Kant\u2019s derivative epistemological sense, a deduction\nis an argument that aims to justify the use of a concept, one that\ndemonstrates that the concept correctly applies to objects. For Kant a\nconcept is a priori just in case its source is the\nunderstanding of the subject and not sensory experience (A80/B106;\nStrawson 1966: 86). The specific a priori concepts whose\napplicability to objects of experience Kant aims to vindicate in the\nTranscendental Deduction are given in his Table of Categories\n(A80/B106); they are Unity, Plurality, and Totality (the Categories of\nQuantity); Reality, Negation, and Limitation (the Categories of\nQuality); Inherence and Subsistence, Causality and Dependence, and\nCommunity (the Categories of Relation), and Possibility-Impossibility,\nExistence-Nonexistence, Necessity-Contingency (the Categories of\nModality).\n\nDavid Hume in effect denies that a deduction can be provided for a\nnumber of metaphysical concepts \u2013 ideas, in his\nterminology \u2013 including the ideas of personal identity, of\nidentity over time more generally, of the self as a subject distinct\nfrom its perceptions, and of causal power or force (1739, 1748). In\nHume\u2019s view, a concept can only be validated by finding a\nsensory experience, that is, an impression, in particular the\none that is the \u2018original\u2019 of that idea, which must\nresemble that idea. But because, for example, any attempt to find an\nimpression of causal power turns out to be fruitless, Hume concludes\nthat this idea does not legitimately apply (1748: \u00a77). In\nKant\u2019s terminology, Hume is determining whether one might\nprovide an empirical deduction of the concept of causal power\n(A85/B117), and from the failure of the attempt to do so, he concludes\nthat this concept lacks objective validity, that is, it does\nnot apply to the objects of our experience.\n\nHume\u2019s position on the deducibility of a priori\nmetaphysical concepts is Kant\u2019s quarry in the Transcendental\nDeduction. But Kant concurs with Hume\u2019s proposal that no\nempirical deduction can be supplied for such concepts. Instead, he\nsets out to provide a different sort of justification for their use,\none that is transcendental rather than empirical. Such a\ntranscendental deduction begins with a premise about any possible\nhuman experience, a premise to which reasonable participants in the\ndebate can be expected initially to agree, and then contends that a\npresupposition and necessary condition of the truth of that premise is\nthe applicability of the a priori concepts in question to the\nobjects of experience. Kant\u2019s Transcendental Deduction features\na number of component transcendental arguments. Each begins with a\npremise either about the self-attributability of mental items,\napperception, or else a premise about the necessity and\nuniversality of some feature of our experience of objects. Kant\u2019\nstrategy is to establish a theory of mental processing,\nsynthesis, by arguing that its truth is a necessary condition\nfor the truth of such a premise, and then to show that the a\npriori concepts at issue \u2013 the categories \u2013 have an\nessential role in this sort of mental processing. On a metaphysical\nidealist interpretation of his position, the objects of experience\nresult from this mental processing, and it is due to the role that the\ncategories have in this processing that they correctly apply to\nobjects. In the Transcendental Deduction Kant would thus intend to\nsecure a normative claim, that the categories correctly apply to the\nobjects of our experience, by establishing a psychological theory\n(Henrich 1989; Patricia Kitcher 1990: 2\u201329; for information on\nrelated argumentative strategies in Kant\u2019s historical context,\nsee Kuehn 1997 and Dyck 2011). The Transcendental Deduction presents\ngeneral considerations supporting the applicability of all the\ncategories to the objects of our experience; it does not concentrate\non the applicability of specific categories. This more focused task is\ntaken up in various sections of the Analytic of Principles\n(A130\u2013235/B169\u2013287).\n\nIn the Metaphysical Deduction (A66\u201383, B92\u2013116)\nKant intends to derive the categories from the specific modes or forms\nof any human thought about the world, the logical forms of\njudgment. The Metaphysical Deduction has an essential role to\nplay in the Transcendental Deduction, and we will discuss this\nargument at an appropriate juncture (when we reach \u00a719 of the\nB-Deduction).\n\nFor Kant, the most significant rival theory of mental processing is\nthat of his target, Hume. Hume concurs that a theory of experience\nrequires an account of the processing of mental items, but he denies\nthat such an account demands a priori concepts or issues in\ntheir legitimate applicability to experience. According to his theory,\nassociationism, our mental repertoire consists solely of\nperceptions, all of which are sensory items \u2013 the more vivid\nimpressions, which constitute sensory experience, and their less vivid\ncopies, the ideas, which function in imagination, memory, reasoning,\nand conceptualization (1748, \u00a7\u00a72, 3). Association is the\nprocess by which these perceptions are related and ordered. A\nsignature feature of association on Hume\u2019s view is that it\nrequires no resources distinct from the perceptions themselves. How\nperceptions are ordered is solely a function of what perceptions alone\ncan provide. Significantly, a subject not constituted solely of\nperceptions has no role in Hume\u2019s theory; the Humean subject is\njust a collection of perceptions (1739: I, IV, vi). These last two\nfeatures in particular make Humean associationism a highly economical\ntheory, which provides it with an initial advantage over Kant\u2019s\nmore complex view. However, Kant contends that associationism cannot\naccount for the facts to which the premises of the Transcendental\nDeduction appeal, and that synthesis by a priori concepts,\nthat is, the categories, is required in addition.\n\nKant characterizes synthesis as \u201cthe act of putting different\nrepresentations together, and grasping what is manifold in them in one\ncognition\u201d (A77/B103); it is a process that \u201cgathers the\nelements for cognition, and unites them to form a certain\ncontent\u201d (A78/B103). Synthesis takes multiple representations\n\u2013 in Kant\u2019s terminology, a \u2018manifold\u2019 \u2013\nand connects them with one another to produce a single further\nrepresentation with cognitive content (Patricia Kitcher 1990, 2011).\nThis process employs concepts as modes or ways of ordering\nrepresentations. A claim critical to the Transcendental Deduction is\nthat it is the categories by means of which manifolds of our\nrepresentations are synthesized. Since the understanding of the\nsubject is the source of the categories, and also a faculty that\nyields synthesis, the subject plays a crucial role in mental\nprocessing. It is important for Kant\u2019s view on mental processing\nthat this subject is distinct from its representations, and this is\nanother respect in which it differs from Hume\u2019s theory.\n\nThis discussion will focus on the Transcendental Deduction in the\nsecond edition of the Critique of Pure Reason (1787) \u2013\nthe B-Deduction \u2013 thoroughly rewritten and rethought\nrelative to the A-Deduction of the first edition (1781). On\nmy reading, in \u00a7\u00a716\u201320 of the B-Deduction Kant employs\na two-pronged strategy for defeating associationism and establishing\nsynthesis. The first, contained in \u00a7\u00a715\u201316, is\ndesigned to show that association cannot account for an aspect of\none\u2019s consciousness of one\u2019s self that Kant refers to as\nthe consciousness of its unity, and that synthesis is\nrequired to provide this explanation. This type of argument he calls\nan argument from above, signifying that it begins with a\npremise about self-consciousness. Correlatively, in\n\u00a7\u00a717\u201320 we find an argument from below, by\nwhich Kant intends to establish that synthesis by means of the\ncategories is needed as a necessary condition of how we represent\nobjects (the above/below terminology is derived from A119; for\nrelevant historical background, see Carl 1989, 1992). On several other\nreadings, as we shall see, the B-Deduction is a more unified argument.\nThere are reasons to accept and reasons to resist interpretations of\nthis kind.\n",
