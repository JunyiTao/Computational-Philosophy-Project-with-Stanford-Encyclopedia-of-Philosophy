    "main_text": "Possibilities\n5. Possibilities\nArrow\u2019s theorem, it has been said, is about the impossibility of\ntrying to do too much with too little information. This remark directs\nattention towards two main avenues leading from Arrow-inspired gloom\ntoward a sunnier view of the possibilities for collective decision\nmaking: not trying to do so much, and using more information. One way\nof not trying to do so much is to relax the requirement, it is a part\nof SO, that all social preferences are\ntransitive.  Section 4.2 briefly considered this\nidea but found it unpromising. Another way is to soften the demand\nof U that there be a social ordering for each\n\u201clogically possible\u201d preference profile. That is, we can\nrestrict the domains of social welfare\nfunctions. Section 5.1 discusses this important\n\u201cescape route\u201d from Arrow\u2019s theorem in some detail. One\nway of using more information is to loosen the independence\nconstraint I. This allows social welfare functions to make\nuse of more of the information that is carried by individual\npreference orderings. See Section 5.2. Another\nway is to extend Arrow\u2019s framework so as to allow individuals to\ncontribute richer information than is carried by preference\norderings. This information can come in the form of scores or grades,\nas discussed in Section 5.3, or in the form of\ncardinal measurements of individual utilities,\nin Section 5.4.\n",
