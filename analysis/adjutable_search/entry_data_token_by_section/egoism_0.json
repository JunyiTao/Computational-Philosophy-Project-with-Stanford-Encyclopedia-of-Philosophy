    "main_text": "Psychological Egoism\n1. Psychological Egoism\n\nAll forms of egoism require explication of \u201cself-interest\u201d\n(or \u201cwelfare\u201d or \u201cwell-being\u201d). There are\nthree main theories. Preference or desire accounts identify\nself-interest with the satisfaction of one\u2019s desires. Often, and\nmost plausibly, these desires are restricted to self-regarding\ndesires. What makes a desire self-regarding is controversial, but\nthere are clear cases and counter-cases: a desire for my own pleasure\nis self-regarding; a desire for the welfare of others is not.\nObjective accounts identify self-interest with the possession of\nstates (such as virtue or knowledge) that are valuable independently\nof whether they are desired. Hybrid accounts give a role to both\ndesires (or pleasure) and states that are valuable independently of\nwhether they are desired. For example, perhaps the increase to my\nwell-being brought about by a satisfied desire (or a pleasure) is even\ngreater if it is a desire for (or pleasure in) knowledge. Or perhaps\nthe increase to my well-being brought about by a piece of knowledge is\neven greater if I desire (or take pleasure in) it. Hedonism, which\nidentifies self-interest with pleasure, is either a preference or an\nobjective account, according to whether what counts as pleasure is\ndetermined by one\u2019s desires. \n\nPsychological egoism claims that each person has but one ultimate aim:\nher own welfare. This allows for action that fails to maximize\nperceived self-interest, but rules out the sort of behavior\npsychological egoists like to target \u2014 such as altruistic\nbehavior or motivation by thoughts of duty alone. It allows for\nweakness of will, since in weakness of will cases I am still aiming at\nmy own welfare; I am weak in that I do not act as I aim. And it allows\nfor aiming at things other than one\u2019s welfare, such as helping\nothers, where these things are a means to one\u2019s welfare.\n\nPsychological egoism is supported by our frequent observation of\nself-interested behavior. Apparently altruistic action is often\nrevealed to be self-interested. And we typically motivate people by\nappealing to their self-interest (through, for example, punishments\nand rewards).\n\nA common objection to psychological egoism, made famously by Joseph\nButler, is that I must desire things other than my own welfare in\norder to get welfare. Say I derive welfare from playing hockey. Unless\nI desired, for its own sake, to play hockey, I would not derive\nwelfare from playing. Or say I derive welfare from helping others.\nUnless I desired, for its own sake, that others do well, I would not\nderive welfare from helping them. Welfare results from my action, but\ncannot be the only aim of my action.\n\nThe psychological egoist can concede that I must have desires for\nparticular things, such as playing hockey. But there is no need to\nconcede that the satisfaction of these desires is not part of my\nwelfare. My welfare might consist simply in the satisfaction of\nself-regarding desires. In the case of deriving welfare from helping\nothers, the psychological egoist can again concede that I would not\nderive welfare without desiring some particular thing, but need not\nagree that what I desire for its own sake is that others do well. That\nI am the one who helps them may, for example, satisfy my\nself-regarding desire for power.\n\nA bigger problem for psychological egoism is that some behavior does\nnot seem to be explained by self-regarding desires. Say a soldier\nthrows himself on a grenade to prevent others from being killed. It\ndoes not seem that the soldier is pursuing his perceived\nself-interest. It is plausible that, if asked, the soldier would have\nsaid that he threw himself on the grenade because he wanted to save\nthe lives of others or because it was his duty. He would deny as\nridiculous the claim that he acted in his self-interest.\n\nThe psychological egoist might reply that the soldier is lying or\nself-deceived. Perhaps he threw himself on the grenade because he\nbelieved that he could not bear to live with himself afterwards if he\ndid not do so. He has a better life, in terms of welfare, by avoiding\nyears of guilt. The main problem here is that while this is a possible\naccount of some cases, there is no reason to think it covers all\ncases. Another problem is that guilt may presuppose that the soldier\nhas a non-self-regarding desire for doing what he takes to be\nright.\n\nThe psychological egoist might reply that some such account must be\nright. After all, the soldier did what he most wanted to do, and so\nmust have been pursuing his perceived self-interest. In one sense,\nthis is true. If self-interest is identified with the satisfaction of\nall of one\u2019s preferences, then all intentional action is\nself-interested (at least if intentional actions are always explained\nby citing preferences, as most believe). Psychological egoism turns\nout to be trivially true. This would not content defenders of\npsychological egoism, however. They intend an empirical theory that,\nlike other such theories, it is at least possible to refute by\nobservation.\n\nThere is another way to show that the trivial version of psychological\negoism is unsatisfactory. We ordinarily think there is a significant\ndifference in selfishness between the soldier\u2019s action and that\nof another soldier who, say, pushes someone onto the grenade to avoid\nbeing blown up himself. We think the former is acting unselfishly\nwhile the latter is acting selfishly. According to the trivial version\nof psychological egoism, both soldiers are equally selfish, since both\nare doing what they most desire.\n\nThe psychological egoist might handle apparent cases of\nself-sacrifice, not by adopting the trivial version, but rather by\nclaiming that facts about the self-interest of the agent explain all\nbehavior. Perhaps as infants we have only self-regarding desires; we\ncome to desire other things, such as doing our duty, by learning that\nthese other things satisfy our self-regarding desires; in time, we\npursue the other things for their own sakes.\n\nEven if this picture of development is true, however, it does not\ndefend psychological egoism, since it admits that we sometimes\nultimately aim at things other than our welfare. An account of the\norigins of our non-self-regarding desires does not show that they are\nreally self-regarding. The soldier\u2019s desire is to save others,\nnot increase his own welfare, even if he would not have desired to\nsave others unless saving others was, in the past, connected to\nincreasing his welfare.\n\nThe psychological egoist must argue that we do not come to pursue\nthings other than our welfare for their own sakes. In principle, it\nseems possible to show this by showing that non-self-regarding desires\ndo not continue for long once their connection to our welfare is\nbroken. However, evidence for this dependence claim has not been\nforthcoming.\n\nIndeed, when examining the empirical evidence, two sorts of approach\nhave been used to argue against psychological egoism.\n\nFirst, Daniel Batson and colleagues found that increased empathy leads\nto increased helping behaviour. One hypothesis is altruistic: empathy\ncauses a non-instrumental desire to help. There are many competing\negoistic hypotheses. Empathy might cause an unpleasant experience that\nsubjects believe they can stop by helping; or subjects might think\nfailing to help in cases of high empathy is more likely to lead to\npunishment by others, or that helping here is more likely to be\nrewarded by others; or subjects might think this about\nself-administered punishment (e.g., guilt) or reward. In an ingenious\nseries of experiments, Batson compared the egoistic hypotheses, one by\none, against the altruistic hypothesis. He found that the altruistic\nhypothesis always made superior predictions. Against the unpleasant\nexperience hypothesis, Batson found that giving high-empathy subjects\neasy ways of stopping the experience other than by helping did not\nreduce helping. Against the punishment by others hypothesis, Batson\nfound that letting high-empathy subjects believe that their behaviour\nwould be secret did not reduce helping. Against the self-administered\nreward hypothesis, Batson found that the mood of high-empathy subjects\ndepended on whether they believed that help was needed, whether or not\nthey could do the helping, rather than on whether they helped (and so\ncould self-reward). Against the self-administered punishment\nhypothesis, Batson found that making high-empathy subjects believe\nthey would feel less guilt from not helping (by letting them believe\nthat few others had volunteered to help) did not reduce helping.\n\nOne might quibble with some of the details. Perhaps subjects did not\nbelieve that the easy ways of stopping the painful experience Batson\nprovided, such as leaving the viewing room, would stop it. (For an\naccount of an experiment done in reply, favouring Batson, see Stich,\nDoris and Roedder 2010, as well as Batson 2011 135\u2013145.) Perhaps\na Batson-proof egoistic hypothesis could be offered: say that subjects\nbelieve that the only way of stopping the pain (or avoiding\nself-punishment) is by helping (though whether subjects have this\nbelief might be tested for on its own). But on the whole,\nBatson\u2019s experiments are very bad news for psychological egoism.\n(For further discussion of Batson, see May 2011a and Slote 2013.)\n\nSecond, Elliot Sober and David Wilson argue that evolutionary theory\nsupports altruism. Parental care might be explained on egoistic\ngrounds: a belief about the child\u2019s distress causes the parent\npain that the parent believes she can alleviate by helping, or the\nparent believes that she will be caused pain if she does not help.\nParental care might also be explained on altruistic grounds: the\nparent has a non-instrumental desire that the child do well. Lastly,\nparental care might be explained by a combination of these mechanisms.\nSober and Wilson argue that more reliable care would be provided by\nthe altruistic or combination mechanisms. Given the importance of\nparental care, this is a reason for thinking that natural selection\nwould have favoured one of these mechanisms. The egoistic mechanism is\nless reliable for several reasons: beliefs about the child\u2019s\ndistress may fail to cause the parent pain (even bodily injury does\nnot always cause pain, so pain is unlikely to be always caused by\nbeliefs about distress); the parent may fail to believe that helping\nwill best reduce her pain; there may not be enough pain produced; the\ncombination view has the advantage of an extra mechanism.\n\nThis argument has drawbacks. Natural selection does not always provide\nback-up mechanisms (I have but one liver). Natural selection sometimes\nhas my desires caused by feelings that are produced by a belief rather\nthan directly by the belief (my desire to run away from danger is\noften caused by my fear, rather than by the mere belief that there is\ndanger). And in these cases, as in the case of the imperfectly\ncorrelated pain and bodily injury, there seems usually to be\nenough feeling. The altruistic hypothesis also has some of the\nsame problems: for example, just as there might not be enough pain,\nthe non-instrumental desire that the child do well might not be strong\nenough to defeat other desires. Indeed, without an estimate of how\nstrong this desire is, there is no reason to think the egoistic\nhypothesis is less reliable. It may have more points at which it can\ngo wrong, but produce more care than a direct but weak altruistic\nmechanism. (For many of these worries, and others, see Stich, Doris\nand Roedder 2010.)\n\nEven if evolutionary arguments can be met, however, psychological\negoism faces the problems noted earlier. In response, the\npsychological egoist might move to what Gregory Kavka (1986,\n64\u201380) calls \u201cpredominant egoism:\u201d we act\nunselfishly only rarely, and then typically where the sacrifice is\nsmall and the gain to others is large or where those benefiting are\nfriends, family, or favorite causes. Predominant egoism is not\ntroubled by the soldier counter-example, since it allows exceptions;\nit is not trivial; and it seems empirically plausible.
