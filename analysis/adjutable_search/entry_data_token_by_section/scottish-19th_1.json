    "main_text": "Thomas Brown (1778\u20131820)\n2. Thomas Brown (1778\u20131820)\n\nFrom 1810 onwards, when Thomas Brown (1778\u20131820) took up the\nChair of Moral Philosophy at Edinburgh, the story of Scottish\nphilosophy is that of repeated attempts to resolve the tension that\nlay within that \u201cscience of mind\u201d. It is also a story of\nremarkable institutional continuity. Brown was a student of Dugald\nStewart (1753\u20131828), who in turn was a student and friend of\nReid and, having taught briefly at Glasgow, held the Chair of Moral\nPhilosophy at Edinburgh. This continuity was sustained throughout most\nof the succeeding century as the students of Scottish professors\nthemselves became Scottish professors, often moving between the four\nancient universities. This was especially notable in the case of the\nLogic Chair in Edinburgh, where Hamilton was succeeded by Campbell\nFraser, Fraser by Andrew Seth, and Seth by Norman Kemp Smith, a\nsuccession of professor/student stretching from 1836\u20131945.\n\nStewart was enormously highly thought of in his own day, and had a\nEuropean-wide reputation. At the time of his death he was described as\n\u2018the pride and ornament of Scotland\u2019, and a striking\nmonument to him was erected on Edinburgh's Calton Hill. Yet in\nretrospect Stewart's thought continued the framework established by\nthe 8th century Scots, and arguably made no notably innovative\ncontribution to the central debate in Scottish philosophy. It was\nBrown who took Scottish philosophy into a new phase.\n\nBrown was a poet and physician as well as a philosopher, and a rather\nmore independent thinker than Stewart, so much so, in fact, that\nStewart regarded him as something of a traitor to the philosophy of\nReid. Perhaps because of his medical background, Brown was sympathetic\nto Humean empiricism, and to a large extent endorsed both Hume's\nrejection of metaphysics and his associationist psychology. Brown's\nfirst book, published in 1798 at the early age of twenty, was a set of\nObservations on the Zoonomia of Erasmus Darwin. His premature\ndeath in 1820 meant that he published relatively little philosophy\nduring his life time, though his Inquiry into the Relation of Cause\nand Effect revealed his sympathy for Hume. At the time of his\ndeath he left behind voluminous lectures that were posthumously\npublished. In them he was critical of Reid, though on certain issues\nhe may be said to have sided with Reid against Hume. In his most\nfrequently quoted remark, however, which does not come from the\nlectures, he famously sought to diminish the distance between the\ntwo.\n\nReid bawled out that we must believe in an outward world; but added,\nin a whisper, we can give no reason for our belief. Hume cries out\nthat we can give no reason for such a notion; and whispers, I own we\ncannot get rid of it. (Mackintosh, 1837, 346)\n\n\nBrown's lectures were immensely popular with students, and on\npublication they were rapturously received and widely read, running\nthrough a great many editions, both in Britain and America, for\nseveral decades. Despite this popularity, after 1850 or so, they fell\ninto total neglect. This may have been because Brown's qualified\nchampionship of Hume sat rather uncomfortably with the consensus among\nScottish philosophers for most of the nineteenth century. Consequently\nthe greatest contribution that his lectures made to philosophical\ndebate was second hand \u2013 namely the re-interpretation and defence of\nReid that they induced on the part of the most prominent philosopher\nof the period\u2014Sir William Hamilton.\n",
