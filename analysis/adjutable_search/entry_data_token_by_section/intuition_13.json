    "main_text": "Challenges and Defenses || Defenses of Intuitions: Self-Support and Epistemic Circularity\n3.5 Defenses of Intuitions: Self-Support and Epistemic Circularity\n\nThere are, broadly speaking, two ways of defending the use of\nintuitions as evidence. The first possible defense would be an\nempirical defense of intuitions by arguing against the second premise\nof the Argument from Lack of Independent Calibration\n (\u00a73.2).\n The defense would proceed by providing an inductive argument, based\non non-intuitive evidence, that the contents of intuitions (either\ngenerally or of some specific sort) are reliable.\n\nThe only other apparent possible defense of the thesis that intuitions\nprima facie justify belief in their content appeals, as does\nthe traditional rationalist, to the fact that there are many\nparticular propositions which one seems justified in believing simply\nin virtue of their being the content of a rational intuition (Bealer\n1998; BonJour 1998). The strength of the conclusion is, of course,\nmore supported to the extent that such examples are multiplied. And,\nas noted above, there appear to be many such examples.\n\nThis defense may be generalized by claiming that intuition is\nself-supporting insofar as the general claim that intuitions\nprovide prima facie justification for belief in their\ncontents is itself intuitive. The possibility of such a defense is the\nresult of the same fact that revealed that all of the extant local\nskeptical arguments run afoul of the non-self-undermining\nconstraint\u2014the fact that intuitions seem to be the only source\nof justification for claims about justification, reason, evidence, and\nother epistemic properties.\n\nThe obvious concern about this sort of defense (in both its particular\nand general form) is the fact that it necessarily involves epistemic\ncircularity of some kind. That is, it defends the appeal to intuitions\nas reasons for belief by appeal to intuitions. It seems clear that\nepistemically circular defenses are sometimes illegitimate, as when\nquestions about the epistemic probity of appeals to a crystal ball are\nanswered by consulting the ball. However, as indicated above\n (\u00a73.2),\n it also appears that some sort of epistemic circularity is\ninevitable in the attempt to defend our most basic modes of evidence\nand justification. Exactly when such circularity is epistemically\ndisabling and when, if ever, it is acceptable is a difficult question\nwhich cannot be here treated in detail (Alston 1986, 1993; Bergmann\n2006; Cohen 2002; Vogel 2008). However, a few remarks are in\norder.\n\nFirst, if epistemic circularity is always unacceptable, then\nit is impossible to defend the appeal to intuition. However, the same\nresult will follow (ultimately) for any putative source of evidence.\nSo, while it will be the case that the use of intuitions as evidence\ncannot be defended, it will also follow that the reliance on\nperception, memory and introspection can also not be defended.\nUniversal skepticism would appear to follow. Alternatively, if\nepistemic circularity is sometimes acceptable, then no reason has been\nprovided why it is not acceptable in the case of rational\nintuition.\n\nSecond, if we focus on the question of whether we are prima\nfacie justified in accepting the contents of our intuitions,\nthere may be a feature which distinguishes intuition from all other\nputative sources of evidence. Only intuition is clearly capable of\nepistemic self-support because it is the only source which produces\nnon-doxastic states with epistemically normative content.\nWhether or not apparent perception that p, introspection that\np, or apparent memory that p justify us in believing\ntheir content is, it seems, a question they cannot answer as their\ncontent is never epistemic. Hence, intuition appears distinguishable\nfrom our other putative sources of evidence in being both\nrequired for a coherent epistemology and capable of epistemic\nself-support. So, if any source of evidence can be defended against\nglobal skeptical attack, it seems that intuitions can.\n\nRecently, a number of philosophers have argued that the epistemic\ncredentials of intuitions can be defended by appealing to similarities\nbetween perceptual justification and intuitive justification or to a\ngeneral doctrine regarding non-inferential justification. According to\nperceptual dogmatism, a person having a perceptual experience\nor a perceptual seeming with propositional content p is thereby\nprima facie justified in believing p (Pryor 2000).\nAccording to intuitive dogmatism, a person having an\nintuition or intellectual seeming with propositional content p\nis thereby prima facie justified in believing p.\nAccording to general dogmatism, when it seems to a person\nthat p, that person is thereby prima facie justified\nin believing p. It follows from general dogmatism that\nintuitions, as characterized by the various versions of the sui\ngeneris state view above\n (\u00a71.3),\n are a source of justification (Huemer 2005, 2007). Moreover, it seems\nextremely plausible that if perceptual dogmatism is true, then so is\nintuitive dogmatism (Chudnoff 2011b; Koksvik 2011; Bengson 2015).\n\nWhatever the merits of general or perceptual dogmatism, it is\nimportant to recognize that appealing to them in defending intuitive\ndogmatism involves exactly the same sort of epistemic\ncircularity as that involved in the more straightforward defense\npreviously noted. This is because all versions of dogmatism are\nthemselves justified entirely on intuitive grounds\u2014by the fact\nthat they properly accommodate our various intuitions about the\nconditions under which a person has non-inferential propositional\njustification. Hence, appeals to dogmatism of any sort are ultimately\njustified only if intuitions do provide prima facie\njustification and so cannot serve as an independent defense of the\nappeal to intuitions. Epistemic circularity in the epistemology of\nintuition appears unavoidable.\n",
