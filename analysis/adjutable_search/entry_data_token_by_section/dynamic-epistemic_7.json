    "main_text": "Complex epistemic interactions || The Logic of Epistemic Actions\n3.3 The Logic of Epistemic Actions\n\nNow that we have seen a number of action models, we turn to the formal\nsyntax and semantics of the language \\eqref{EAL} of Epistemic\nAction Logic (a.k.a., the Logic of Epistemic Actions).\nWe define the language \\eqref{EAL} along with the set \\(\\AM_*\\) of\npointed action models with preconditions in the language \\eqref{EAL}\naccording to the following recursive grammar:  \n\n\\[\\begin{gather*}\nF  \\ccoloneqq p \\mid F \\wedge F \\mid \\neg F \\mid [a]F \\mid [A,e]F \\\\\n \\small p \\in \\sP,\\; a \\in \\sA,\\; (A,e)\\in\\AM_*\n\\taglabel{EAL}\n\\end{gather*}\\]\n\n\nTo be clear: in the language \\eqref{EAL}, the precondition\n\\(\\pre^A(e)\\) of an action model A may be a formula that\nincludes an action model modality \\([A',e']\\) for some other action\n\\((A',e')\\in\\AM_*\\). For full technical details on how this works,\nplease see\n Appendix H.\n \n\nFor convenience, we let \\(\\AM\\) denote the set of all action models\nwhose preconditions are all in the language \\eqref{EAL}. As we saw in\nthe previous two subsections, the set \\(\\AM_*\\) contains pointed\naction models for public announcements\n (Figure 4),\n private announcements\n (Figure 3),\n semi-private announcements\n (Figure 5),\n and misleading private announcements\n (Figure 6),\n along with many others. The satisfaction relation \\(\\models\\) between\npointed Kripke models and formulas of \\eqref{EAL} is the smallest\nextension of the relation \\(\\models\\) for \\eqref{ML} (see\n Appendix A)\n satisfying the following: \n\n \\(M,w\\models[A,e]G\\) holds if and only if\n\\(M,w\\not\\models\\pre^A(e)\\) or \\(M[A],(w,e)\\models G\\), where the\nKripke model \\(M[A]\\) is defined via the\n BMS product update\n (Baltag, Moss, and Solecki 1999). \n\n\nNote that the formula \\([A,e]G\\) is vacuously true if the precondition\n\\(\\pre(e)\\) of event e is false. Accordingly, the action model\nsemantics retains the assumption of truthfulness that we had for\npublic announcements. That is, for an event to actually occur, its\nprecondition must be true. As a consequence, the occurrence of an\nevent e implies that its precondition \\(\\pre(e)\\) was true, and\nhence the occurrence of an event conveys its precondition formula as a\nmessage. If an event can occur at a given world, then we say that the\nevent is executable at that world. \n\n\nExecutable events and action models. To say that a\npointed action model \\((A,e)\\) is executable at a pointed\nKripke model \\((M,w)\\) means that \\(M,w\\models\\pre(e)\\). To say that\nan event f in an action model A is executable\nmeans that \\((A,f)\\) is executable. To say that an action model\nA is executable in a Kripke model M means there\nis an event f in A and a world v in M such\nthat f is executable at \\((M,v)\\).\n\n\nAs was the case for PAL, one often wishes to restrict attention to\nKripke models whose relations \\(R_a\\) satisfy certain desirable\nproperties such as reflexivity, transitivity, Euclideanness, and\nseriality. In order to study actions over such classes, we must be\ncertain that the actions do not transform a Kripke model in the class\ninto a new Kripke model not in the class; that is, we must ensure that\nthe class of Kripke models is \u201cclosed\u201d under actions. The\nfollowing theorem provides some sufficient conditions that guarantee\nclosure. \n\n\nAction Model Closure Theorem. Let \\(M=(W^M,R^M,V)\\)\nbe a Kripke model and \\(A=(W^A,R^A,\\pre)\\) be an action model\nexecutable in M.\n\n If \\(R^M_a\\) and \\(R^A_a\\) are reflexive, then so is\n\\(R^M[A]_a\\). \nIf \\(R^M_a\\) and \\(R^A_a\\) are transitive, then so is\n\\(R^M[A]_a\\). \nIf \\(R^M_a\\) and \\(R^A_a\\) are Euclidean, then so is \\(R^M[A]_a\\).\n\nIf A satisfies the condition that every event \\(e\\in W^A\\)\ngives rise to a nonempty set \n\n\\[ S(e)\\subseteq \\{f\\in W^A\\mid eR^A_af\\} \\]\n\n of events such that\n\n\\[\n\\textstyle\n\\models \\pre^A(e) \\to\n\\may{a}\\left(\\bigvee_{f\\in S(e)}\\pre^A(f)\\right)\n\\,,\n\\]\n\n then \\(R^M[A]_a\\) is serial. (Note: the condition on\nA and the executability of A in M together imply\nthat \\(R^M_a\\) is serial.) \n\n\n\nThis theorem, like the analogous theorem for Public Announcement\nLogic, is used in providing simple sound and complete theories for the\nLogic of Epistemic Actions based on appropriate\n\u201caction-friendly\u201d logics. \n\n\nAction-friendly logic. To say that a logic \\(\\L\\) is\naction-friendly means we have the following:\n\n \\(\\L\\) is a normal multi-modal logic in the language \\eqref{ML}\n(i.e., with modals \\([a]\\) for each agent \\(a\\in\\sA\\)), \nthere is a class of Kripke models \\(\\sC\\) such that \\(\\L\\) is\nsound and complete with respect to the collection of pointed Kripke\nmodels based on models in \\(\\sC\\), and \nthere is a language \\(\\LEAL\\) (the \u201caction model extension\nof \\(\\L\\)\u201d) obtained from \\eqref{EAL} by restricting the form of\naction models such that \\(\\sC\\) is closed under the product update\nwith executable actions of this form (i.e., performing an executable\naction model of this form on a model in \\(\\sC\\) yields another model\nin \\(\\sC\\)). \n\n\n\nThe various axiomatic theories of modal logic with action models\n(without common knowledge) are obtained based on the choice of an\nunderlying action-friendly logic \\(\\L\\). \n\n\nThe axiomatic theory \\(\\EAL\\). Other names in the\nliterature: \\(\\DEL\\) or \\(\\AM\\) (for \u201caction model\u201d; see\nvan Ditmarsch, van der Hoek, and Kooi 2007).\n\n Axiom schemes and rules for the action-friendly logic \\(\\L\\)\n\n Reduction axioms (each in the language \\(\\LEAL\\)):\n\n\n \\([A,e]p\\leftrightarrow(\\pre(e)\\to p)\\) for letters \\(p\\in\\sP\\)\n\n\u201cAfter a non-executable action, every letter holds\u2014a\ncontradiction. After an executable action, letters retain their truth\nvalues.\u201d \n \\([A,e](G\\land H)\\leftrightarrow([A,e]G\\land[A,e]H)\\)\n\n\u201cA conjunction is true after an action iff each conjunct\nis.\u201d \n \\([A,e]\\lnot G\\leftrightarrow(\\pre(e)\\to\\lnot[A,e]G)\\)\n\n\u201cG is false after an action iff the action, whenever\nexecutable, does not make G true.\u201d \n \\([A,e][a]G\\leftrightarrow (\\pre(e)\\to\\bigwedge_{e R_a f}\n[a][A,f]G)\\)\n\n\u201ca knows G after an action iff the action,\nwhenever executable, is known by a to make G true\ndespite her uncertainty of the actual event.\u201d \n \nAction Necessitation Rule: from G, infer \\([A,e]G\\)\nwhenever the latter is in \\(\\LEAL\\).\n\n\u201cA validity holds after any action.\u201d \n\n\n\nThe first three reduction axioms are nearly identical to the\ncorresponding reduction axioms for \\(\\PAL\\), except that the first and\nthird \\(\\EAL\\) reduction axioms check the truth of a precondition in\nthe place where the \\(\\PAL\\) reduction axioms would check the truth of\nthe formula to be announced. This is actually the same kind of check:\nfor an event, the precondition must hold in order for the event to be\nexecutable; for a public announcement, the formula must be true in\norder for the public announcement to occur (and hence for the public\nannouncement event in question to be \u201cexecutable\u201d). The\nmajor difference between the \\(\\PAL\\) and \\(\\EAL\\) reduction axioms is\nin the fourth \\(\\EAL\\) reduction axiom. This axiom specifies the\nconditions under which an agent has belief (or knowledge) of something\nafter the occurrence of an action. In particular, adopting a doxastic\nreading for this discussion, the axiom says that agent a\nbelieves G after the occurrence of action \\((A,e)\\) if and only\nif the formula \n\n\\[\n\\textstyle\n\\pre(e)\\to\\bigwedge_{e R_af}[a][A,f]G\n\\]\n\n is true. This formula, in turn, says that\nif the precondition is true\u2014and therefore the action is\nexecutable\u2014then, for each of the possible events the agent\nentertains, she believes that G is true if the event in\nquestion occurs. This makes sense: a cannot be sure which of\nthe events has occurred, and so for her to believe something after the\naction has occurred, she must be sure that this something is true no\nmatter which of her entertained events might have been the actual one.\nFor example, if a sees her friend b become elated as he\nlistens to something he hears on the other side of a private phone\ncall, then the a may not know exactly what it is that b\nis being told; nevertheless, a has reason to believe that\nb is receiving good news because, no matter what it is exactly\nthat he is being told (i.e., no matter which of the events she thinks\nthat he may be hearing), she knows from his reaction that he must be\nreceiving good news. \n\nAs was the case for \\(\\PAL\\), the \\(\\EAL\\) reduction axioms allow us\nto \u201creduce\u201d each formula containing action models to a\nprovably equivalent formula whose action model modalities appear\nbefore formulas of lesser complexity, allowing us to eliminate action\nmodel modalities completely via a sequence of provable equivalences.\nAs a consequence, we have the following. \n\n\n\\(\\EAL\\) Reduction Theorem (Baltag, Moss, and Solecki 1998,\n1999; see also Baltag and Moss 2004). Given an\naction-friendly logic \\(\\L\\), every F in the language \\(\\LEAL\\)\nof Epistemic Action Logic (without common knowledge) is\n\\(\\EAL\\)-provably equivalent to a formula \\(F^\\circ\\) coming from the\naction model-free modal language \\eqref{ML}.\n\n\nOnce we have proved \\(\\EAL\\) is sound, the Reduction Theorem leads us\nto axiomatic completeness via the known completeness of the underlying\nmodal theory. \n\n\n\\(\\EAL\\) Soundness and Completeness (Baltag, Moss, and Solecki\n1998, 1999; see also Baltag and Moss 2004). \\(\\EAL\\) is sound\nand complete with respect to the collection \\(\\sC_*\\) of pointed\nKripke models for which the underlying action-friendly logic \\(\\L\\) is\nsound and complete. That is, for each \\(\\LEAL\\)-formula F, we\nhave that \\(\\EAL\\vdash F\\) if and only if \\(\\sC_*\\models F\\).\n\n\nWe saw above that for \\(\\PAL\\) it was possible to combine two\nconsecutive announcements into a single announcement via the schematic\nvalidity \n\n\\[ [F!][G!]H\\leftrightarrow[F\\land[F!]G!]H.  \\]\n\n Something similar is available for action\nmodels. \n\n\nAction model composition. The composition\n\\(A\\circ B=(E,R,\\pre)\\) of action models \\(A=(E^A,R^A,\\pre^A)\\) and\n\\(B=(E^B,R^B,\\pre^B)\\) is defined as follows:\n\n \\(E=E^A\\times E^B\\) \u2014 composed events are pairs \\((e,f)\\)\nof constituent events; \n \\((e_1,f_1) R_a (e_2,f_2)\\) if and only if \\(e_1 R^A_a e_2\\) and\n\\(f_1 R^B_a f_2\\) \u2014 a composed event is entertained iff its\nconstituent events are; and \n \\(\\pre((e_1,e_2))=\\pre^A(e_1)\\land[A,e_1]\\pre^B(e_2)\\) \u2014 a\ncomposed event is executable iff the first constituent is executable\nand, after it occurs, the second constituent is executable as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nComposition Theorem. Each instance of the following\nschemes is \\(\\EAL\\)-derivable (so long as they are permitted in the\nlanguage \\(\\LEAL\\)).\n\n Composition Scheme: \\([A,e][B,f]G\\leftrightarrow[A\\circ\nB,(e,f)]G\\) \n Associativity Scheme: \\([A\\circ B,(e,f)][C,g]H \\leftrightarrow\n[A,e][B\\circ C,(f,g)]H\\) \n\n\n\nWe conclude this subsection with two complexity results for\n\\eqref{EAL}. \n\n\nEAL Complexity (Aucher and Schwarzentruber 2013). Let\n\\(\\sC\\) be the class of all Kripke models.\n\nThe satisfiability problem for \\eqref{EAL} over \\(\\sC\\) is\nNEXPTIME-complete.\nThe model checking problem for \\eqref{EAL} over \\(\\sC\\) is\nPSPACE-complete.\n\n\n\nAppendix G\n provides information on action model equivalence (including the\nnotions of action model bisimulation and emulation), studies a simple\nmodification that enables action models to change the truth value of\npropositional letters (permitting so-called \u201cfactual\nchanges\u201d), and shows how to add common knowledge to \\(\\EAL\\).\n\n",
