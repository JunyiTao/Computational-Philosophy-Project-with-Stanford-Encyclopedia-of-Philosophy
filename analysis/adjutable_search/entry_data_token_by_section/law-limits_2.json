    "main_text": "Legal Moralism: Restrictive Factors that Can Defeat Prima Facie Wrongs || Liberty\n2.2 Liberty\n\nAs for liberty, \u201cthere must be\u201d, says Devlin,\n\u201ctoleration of the maximum individual freedom that is consistent\nwith the integrity of society\u201d (Devlin 1965: 16).\n\u201cToleration\u201d only arises in relation to conduct of which\none disapproves: toleration is not approval (Devlin 1965: 18; cf.\nOberdiek 2001; Green 2008). He gives two examples\u2014cruelty to\nanimals and \u2013the issue with which his view is most famously\nassociated\u2014homosexual sex and, as he puts it, the \u201cgeneral\nabhorrence of homosexuality\u201d in the UK in the late 1950s and\nearly 1960s (Devlin 1965: 17). As regards both, his question is: are\nthey beyond toleration by the criminal law? Devlin\u2019s answer is\nyes to the first and\u2014although there is a widespread erroneous\nview on this in the\n literature[5]\u2014no\n to the second. In other words, liberty or freedom of human choice\ncannot defeat the prima facie right of society to criminalize\ncruelty to animals on grounds of its wrongfulness, but, in the case of\nconsensual homosexual sex in private, it can (Devlin, Birmingham et\nal. 1965; cf. Devlin 1965: ix). On the latter issue, one might\ncertainly disagree (to put it mildly) with the claim that the\nreason gay sex ought not to be criminalized is that it is\nwithin the bounds of toleration, for that implies that such conduct is\nmorally wrongful in the first place. And one might also strongly doubt\nthe plausibility of Devlin\u2019s means of discerning where the\nboundary of maximum individual freedom lies\u2014turning both on how\nwidespread a moral belief is and on how intensely it\nis felt and\n believed.[6]\n We will return below to these points when we consider how\n\u201cmorality\u201d should be best understood in legal moralism\n (section 3).\n The point for now is to illustrate the structure of a legal moralism\nsuch as that of Devlin. In short Devlin took both animal cruelty and\nhomosexuality to be prima facie morally wrong, but took the\nformer all things considered to hold firm against liberty as a\npotential defeating condition, and the latter to be defeated by\nliberty (and other factors) when all things are considered. Moore in\nhis brand of legal moralism also stresses the place of liberty. In his\nview, \u201cthere is always some reason not to legally coerce\nbehaviour, namely, that to do so diminishes the opportunities of those\ncoerced, diminishes the likelihood of autonomously chosen rightful\nbehaviour etc.\u201d (Moore 1997: 749; 2014).\n\nThere is a controversy here as to whether the negative\nliberty which Moore explicitly invokes (and which Devlin assumes) can\nground the requisite prima facie reason against legal\ncoercion (for scepticism see Tadros 2016b: 79\u201382 and the\nresponse in Moore 2016:\n 352).[7]\n This raises the issue much explored in the philosophical literature\nof the extent to which liberty should be understood as \u201cnegative\nliberty\u201d or \u201cpositive liberty\u201d or some combination\nof the two (Carter 2019). Negative liberty, as Ian Carter puts it,\n\n\nis the absence of obstacles, barriers or constraints. One has negative\nliberty to the extent that actions are available to one in this\nnegative sense. Positive liberty is the possibility of acting\u2014or\nthe fact of acting\u2014in such a way as to take control of\none\u2019s life and realize one\u2019s fundamental purposes. (Carter\n2019)\n\n\nAmy Baehr blocks out how the negative/positive liberty distinction\ntakes shape in liberal feminist writing, labelling approaches of the\nformer kind \u201cclassical-liberal feminism\u201d, and approaches\nof the latter kind as \u201cegalitarian-liberal feminism\u201d\n(Baehr 2021). As we saw in the previous subsection in relation to\nprivacy, it is a sign of the potential flexibility of a broad legal\nmoralist approach, that liberal-feminist accounts of freedom could\npotentially be deployed so as to yield potential defeating conditions\nfor all-things-considered determinations in given cases of whether\nlegal coercion can legitimately be deployed to counter an identified\nwrong. We touch on this issue again below\n (section 6.2).\n",
