Luther\u2019s Life and Works\n\nLuther lived an interesting life in interesting times\u2014where to a\nsignificant degree those times were made interesting by his\nlife\u2019s impact upon them. This impact began with the publication\nof his Ninety-Five Theses on 31 October 1517, in which as a\nyoung professor at Wittenberg he attacked the Church\u2019s sale of\nindulgences; this was then followed by various further disputations\nand disputes as well as published works that defended his increasingly\nradical position, leading to his excommunication in 1521 and his\nfamously defiant appearance at the Diet of Worms. Managing to escape\ncapture under the protection of Frederick the Wise, Elector of Saxony,\nand after a period of seclusion at Wartburg castle, Luther returned to\nWittenberg, where he continued his teaching, writing and translating;\nmarried; and engaged with the complex and fraught swirl of forces\nunleashed by his work at various levels\u2014in theology, in the\nChurch, in politics, and in society at large. While he had fathered\nthe Reformation, as it has become known, he did not set out to divide\nthe Christian Church, and the movement quickly took on a momentum that\nhe could not control, but which still in certain fundamental ways\nbears the stamp of his thought.\n\nLuther was born on 10 November 1483 in Eisleben in the Holy Roman\nEmpire, not into the peasantry as he liked to claim, but into a\nrelatively prosperous mining\n family.[2]\n His father, Hans, gave him a good education, intending for him to\nbecome a lawyer and thus assist the family business. In 1501 Luther\nwent from school to the University of Erfurt, where in 1505 he became\na Master of Arts, a degree which included the study and teaching of\nAristotle, while he was also exposed to nominalism and to humanism.\nHowever, rather than continuing with his legal training, later in the\nsame year Luther chose instead to enter the Augustinian monastery at\nErfurt, much to the annoyance of his father\u2014and as Luther\nexplained it later, on the basis of a vow made in a violent thunder\nstorm to St Anna (the patron saint of miners), that this is what he\nwould do if he was spared. Whatever the truth in this story, in his\nown mind at least Luther seems to have understood his change of\ndirection as a kind of conversion experience, and the entry into a new\ntype of spiritual life.\n\nHowever, Luther did not find this life an easy one, later recalling\nthat while he tried to live without reproach and made full use of\nconfession, he still felt that he \u201cwas a sinner before God with\nan extremely disturbed conscience\u201d (\u201cPreface to the\nComplete Edition of Luther\u2019s Latin Writings\u201d, 1545, WA\n54:185/LW 34:336), in spite of the reassurances given him by his\nmentor Johann von Staupitz (1468\u20131524), then vicar-general of\nthe observant wing of the Augustinians. This anxiety and fear meant\nthe Luther underwent what he termed Anfechtungen, spiritual\ntrials or temptations, as fears about his salvation could lead him to\nturn against God, while in later years he felt he was struggling with\nthe devil. Luther was further disturbed by his father\u2019s response\nwhen attending the first Mass at which his son officiated upon being\nordained in 1507: his father suggested that Luther\u2019s vow to St\nAnna may have been forced out of him by the devil, causing him to\nbreak the commandment to obey one\u2019s parents. Some commentators\nhave speculated that these two difficult relationships with father\nfigures are not unconnected (for a classic but controversial study,\nsee Erikson 1958; see also Roper 2016: 48\u201349).\n\nAs a monk in the monastery at Erfurt and as a temporary lecturer at\nWittenberg, Luther\u2019s education continued under his teachers\nJodocus Trutfetter (1460\u20131519) and Bartholomaeus Arnoldi of\nUsingen (1465\u20131532), as he followed a theology curriculum\ndominated by Ockhamism, studying central texts such as Peter\nLombard\u2019s Sentences and commentaries on them by Gabriel\nBiel and Pierre d\u2019Ailly, Aristotle\u2019s works with\nOckham\u2019s commentaries, and major works by Augustine, while also\nlecturing on some of them. In 1512 Luther replaced Staupitz at the\nuniversity in Wittenberg as professor of the Bible, a position he was\nto hold until his\n death.[3]\n Earlier in the same year, Luther made his only excursion beyond\nGerman lands, travelling to Rome on behalf of Staupitz; he was later\nto present this as an experience that began to turn him against the\nreligious rituals and practices he found there, including that of\nindulgences.\n\nIt was this issue of indulgences that in 1517 led Luther to write\nninety-five theses intended for debate or disputation on the topic,\ncriticising this widespread practice as selling the remission of sins;\nthis practice had been intensified by the efforts of Pope Leo X to\nraise funds for a new basilica of St Peter in Rome, efforts that were\nspearheaded locally by a Dominican friar Johann Tetzel. While\naccording to legend Luther nailed the text of the theses to the church\ndoor, in reality it seems he merely sent them to Archbishop Albrecht\nof Mainz, and perhaps they were posted up on the door by someone else;\nbut it was thanks to printed versions that they soon began to\ncirculate more widely. This condemnation of indulgences was an act of\nsome defiance within the politics of the Church, as was the criticism\nof the authority of the power of the Pope which Luther associated with\nit; but earlier in the same year Luther had taken a step of a more\nintellectually radical kind with another set of theses, that have come\nto be called his Disputation Against Scholastic Theology, and\nwhich grew out of his lectures and reading in previous years,\nparticularly his engagement with Psalms, Paul\u2019s letters, and the\nworks of Augustine and the latter\u2019s attacks on Pelagianism. In\nthis disputation, written with characteristic vehemence, Luther\nsketched out what may be called an uncompromising Augustinianism in\nopposition to what are portrayed as the more Pelagian positions of\nfigures such as Scotus, Ockham, and Biel, behind which was said to\nstand the malign influence of Aristotle. At the heart of this dispute,\nas we shall see, is the key issue of grace, and whether this can be\nattained and earned through our efforts by \u201cdoing what in us\nlies\u201d (facere quod in se est). This question raised in\nthe context of scholastic theology also provides the intellectual\nbackground to Luther\u2019s argument against indulgences in the\nNinety-Five Theses, which to him were in effect just another\ndubious method of gaining merit.\n\nIt was against this background that around this time Luther had his\nso-called \u201ctower experience\u201d, which like the thunder\nstorm, was later portrayed by Luther as a life-changing moment in a\nway that may be more myth than fact, and is named after the tower of\nthe monastery in Wittenberg where it is said to have occurred (1532,\nWA TR 3 no 3232a\u2013c/LW 54:193\u20134). In recounting the event,\nLuther explains that he came to radically re-think how it is that\njustification and hence salvation is possible for us at all: namely\nnot through our attempts to conform to God\u2019s law, but through\nfaith as a form of \u201cpassive righteousness\u201d. From this\nrealization, Luther later claimed (in his preface to the edition of\nhis works published in his life time) that he was freed from his anger\nagainst an accusing God, and the anxiety that no such God could ever\nbe known to be placated; instead he now recognised God\u2019s\ngratuitous love and salvation, bestowed on us through divine grace\n(1545, WA 54:186/LW 34:336\u20137).\n\nLuther was able to develop this new position further in another\ndisputation, this time held in Heidelberg in 1518, where thanks to the\ncontroversy unleashed by the Ninety-five Theses, he was\ninvited by Staupitz to present his theological ideas to the triennial\nassembly of the German Augustinians. In this Heidelberg\nDisputation, Luther continued his assault on \u201cworks\nrighteousness\u201d, and developed further an associated attack on\nfree will, while he also presented a contrast that was to prove\nfundamental to his thinking, between a \u201ctheology of glory\u201d\nand a \u201ctheology of the cross\u201d. He associated the former\nwith his opponents, and himself with the latter, arguing that it is\nonly through despair at our failure to gain salvation for ourselves\nthat we are truly made ready to be given salvation through grace. It\nnow became clear to his audience that Luther (who to mark this change\nin perspective had just previously started signing himself\n\u201cLuther\u201d in short for \u201celeutherios\u201d\nor the \u201cfreed one\u201d, instead of his family\u2019s actual\nname of \u201cLuder\u201d) was attempting not merely to confront\nthe Church on the issue of indulgences, but also to question what he\nperceived to be its misguided theological outlook.\n\nLuther\u2019s position on indulgences, and his challenge to the Pope,\nhad now begun to draw the attention of higher authorities in the\nChurch, and in 1518 he was summoned to Augsburg to meet with the papal\nlegate Cardinal Tommaso de Vio, known as Cajetan, who was\ninvestigating the matter. He tried to get Luther to recant, but he\nrefused to back down in any way. In 1519, Luther travelled to Leipzig\nfor another disputation, this time with Johann Eck, a theologian who\nhad earlier criticised his Ninety-Five Theses. The\nconfrontation was a highly charged affair, also conducted in printed\npamphlets and associated satirical texts written by supporters, in\nwhich Luther again vehemently defended his ground. Eck then travelled\nto Rome to make his case, hence contributing to the papal decision to\nissue the bull Exsurge Domine on 15 June 1520, which\nthreatened to excommunicate this troublesome opponent.\n\nLuther\u2019s response was characteristically defiant, later that\nyear burning the bull in front of his supporters in Wittenberg, while\nhimself accusing the Pope of heresy and worse in his reposts which\nincluded Against the Cursed Bull of the Antichrist. Having\njust published his Treatise on Good Works in which he set out\nhis fundamental position on the relation between grace and works,\nLuther responded to this new situation in three significant writings\nalso published in 1520: Address to the Christian Nobility of the\nGerman Nation, The Babylonian Captivity of the Church,\nand The Freedom of a Christian. The first two texts argue his\ncase against the Pope and key practices of the Church, and the third\nreflects on how freedom is possible for human beings trapped in sin.\nUnsurprisingly, given his recalcitrance, Luther\u2019s formal\nexcommunication followed on 3 January 1521, in the bull Decet\nRomanum Pontificem. This was followed by a summons from Charles\nV, the recently elected head of the Holy Roman Empire, for Luther to\nattend the Diet, or regular imperial assembly, at Worms. Choosing to\naccept the summons despite the great personal risks involved, knowing\nthat in rather similar circumstances the Czech theologian Jan Hus (c.\n1372\u20131415) had been burnt at the stake for heresy, Luther was\nonce more asked to recant, and once more he refused. It is again\ndoubtful whether he actually uttered the famous words \u201chere I\nstand, I cannot do otherwise\u201d, but he is recorded as summarizing\nhis position by saying: \n\n\nUnless I am convinced by the testimony of the Scriptures or by clear\nreason (for I do not trust either in the Pope or in councils alone,\nsince it is well known that they often erred and contradicted\nthemselves), I am bound by the Scriptures I have quoted and my\nconscience is captive to the Word of God. I cannot and will not\nretract anything, since it is neither safe nor right to go against\nconscience. (1521, WA 7:838/LW 32:112)\n\n\nFearing for his safety after this defiant performance, which did\nindeed lead to the Edict of Worms declaring him a heretic and an\noutlaw, Luther was spirited away to the Wartburg castle under the\nprotection of the Elector of Saxony, Frederick the Wise. Barring a\nbrief secret visit back to Wittenberg in December 1521, he was based\nthere until he could return openly to the city on 6 March 1522. While\nat the Wartburg he began his German translation of the New Testament,\nwhich would be followed (in serialised fashion) by the Old Testament,\nand eventually the landmark Luther Bible of 1534/1545. He also\nresponded to criticism in support of the Pope by a Louvain theologian\nin Against Latomus (1522), re-iterating key elements of his\nposition concerning the relation between sin and grace in forceful\nlanguage. \n\nAs well as responding to attacks from the Catholic Church, in this\nperiod Luther began to face increasing challenges from his \u201cown \npeople\u201d within the reform movement \n itself.[4]\n Upon returning to Wittenberg from his relative\nseclusion, Luther found himself embroiled in controversies over the\ndirection being taken by other figures such as Andreas Bodenstein von\nKarlstadt (1486\u20131541) and Thomas M\u00fcntzer (c.\n1489\u20131525), and was caught up in associated theological\ndisputes, while also facing growing political opposition. Luther\npreached the Invocavit (Lenten) Sermons which restored order to the\ncity, and responded to his fellow reformers in A Sincere\nAdmonition by Martin Luther to all Christians to Guard against\nInsurrection and Rebellion (1522), and to some of these political\ndifficulties in his pamphlet On Temporal [or secular: weltlicher] Authority: To What Extent it\nShould be Obeyed (1523), in which he drew a distinction between\ntwo kingdoms or empires (die zwei Reiche) in an attempt to\nmake clear where he took the limits of the power of princes to lie.\nNow no longer a monk, he published On the Estate of Marriage\nin 1522, and himself married Katharina von Bora in 1525, after she had\nleft her convent with other nuns, convinced by Luther\u2019s\narguments against monasticism. The marriage was a successful and happy one, and they were to have six children\ntogether, of whom two daughters were to die young, affecting Luther greatly. Meanwhile, theological and doctrinal disputes\nwere to persist for the rest of Luther\u2019s career, on issues such\nas the Eucharist (or Lord's Supper: Heiliges Adendmahl) and baptism, both within the evangelical movement\ninvolving figures such as the sacramentarian Karlstadt, and the Swiss\nreformers Ulrich Zwingli (1484\u20131531) and Johannes Oecolampadius\n(1482\u20131531), and outside it with the Anabaptists. On both\nissues, Luther resisted the accounts of these sacraments as having a\nmere symbolic value, often arguing that this viewpoint comes from an\nurge to put reason above the authority of scripture (see, for example,\nAgainst the Heavenly Prophets (1525, WA 18:62\u2013125,\n134\u2013214/LW 40:79\u2013223), That These Words of Christ,\n\u201cThis is My Body\u201d, Etc., Still Stand Firm Against the\nFanatics (1527, WA 23:38\u2013320/LW 37:3\u2013150), and\nConcerning Rebaptism (1528, WA 26:144\u201374/LW\n40:229\u201362)). \n\nIn 1524, Luther faced criticism from a different quarter, as the\nleading Christian humanist Desiderius Erasmus was finally persuaded to\nengage with Luther\u2019s position in print, and despite\nLuther\u2019s earlier hopes for his\n endorsement,[5]\n chose instead to focus critically on the latter\u2019s view of\nfreedom which had been initially expressed in the thirteenth of\nLuther\u2019s theses from the Heidelberg Disputation (1518)\nand further underlined in Luther\u2019s response to the bull of Leo X\n (1520).[6]\n Erasmus replied to the latter in his A Diatribe or Discussion on\nFree Will (De libero arbitrio diatribe sive\ncollatio)\u2014where \u201cdiatribe\u201d here is used not in\nthe modern sense, but in the earlier sense of looking for a consensus\non probable opinion through discussion. Luther, however, responded a\nyear later to Erasmus\u2019s intentionally measured and urbane effort with what\namounts to a diatribe in the modern form, entitled De servo\narbitrio, which may be translated \u201cOn the bondage [or\nslavery] of the will [or free choice]\u201d. Luther\u2019s invective\nshocked and offended Erasmus, who replied with his two volume\nProtector of the Diatribe (Hyperaspistes\n diatribae)[7]\n in 1526 and 1527, in which Erasmus\u2019s language is almost as\nintemperate as Luther\u2019s own. As Luther emphasised, at the heart\nof this dispute lay issues that were central to his thinking,\nconcerning grace, human agency, and divine knowledge and power, played\nout against the background of Augustine\u2019s earlier disputes with\nPelagianism, of which Luther insistently accused Erasmus, much to the\nlatter\u2019s frustration.\n\nLuther was also drawn into controversy of a more political and social\nkind, as he sought to respond to the events known as the\n\u201cPeasants\u2019 War\u201d or \u201cPeasants\u2019\nRevolt\u201d (Bauernkrieg), when in 1525 large areas of\ncentral Europe saw agrarian grievances lead to more general disorder,\npartly fuelled by appeal to reformation ideas, and partly by an appeal\nto scripture which Luther himself had seemed to champion. Luther first\nresponded with relative moderation in his Admonition to\nPeace, in which after criticising both the rulers and the peasants, he urged dialogue between the two parties. But the\non-going violence led him to take sides with the secular authorities,\nas the title of his next work made clear: Against the Thieving,\nMurderous Hordes of Peasants. The vehement tone of this text shocked even Luther\u2019s supporters, and led him to attempt to clarify his position further in An Open Letter on the Harsh Book Against the Peasants, though his basic stance was not much changed, and by then the damage was done. That stance was perhaps\npolitically expedient to ensure continuing support from the princes\nfor his reformation, but it nonetheless continues to raise questions\nregarding the integrity of his political judgement, and more generally\nfor the significance of his social and political thought. In the same\nperiod, Luther sought to instill his form of theology and religious\npractice on the growing reformed communities through his German\nMass (1526) and his catechisms (1529).\n\nIn 1530, Luther was drawn into a further Diet, this time at Augsburg\nbut, fearing for his safety, Luther himself remained in Coburg, while\nhis position was represented by his gifted younger\nprot\u00e9g\u00e9 Philip Melanchthon (1497\u20131560), who had\nfirst joined Luther in Wittenberg in 1518. The aim of the Diet, to be\nattended by the Emperor Charles V, was to achieve some reconciliation\nbetween the Catholic and reformed positions. Luther forwarded his\nstrongly worded suggestions as to how the latter should be represented\nin his \u201cexhortation\u201d, but Melanchthon opted instead to\npresent a more moderate position to the Diet, in 28 articles later\nknown as the Augsburg Confession. This was part of a process\nthrough which Melanchthon sought to mediate and in some respects\nsoften Luther\u2019s own views, not always to the liking of the\nlatter, though their close relationship remained largely intact. The\nDiet ended in failure and, fearing suppression from imperial forces,\nLuther wrote his Warning to his Dear German People (1531), in\nwhich now he sanctioned armed resistance, arguing that defence of the\ngospel overrode civil obedience. Instead, however, the list of\nLutheran territories continued to grow, forming the League of\nSmalcalden in 1531. It was a Diet of this League held in 1537 which\nLuther was to address with his Smalcald Articles; published\nin 1538, these contain his last word on confessional and doctrinal\nissues. He also argued against a council called by the Pope in The\nCouncils and the Church (1539). While still at Coburg, Luther defended some of his practices on translation against critics in On Translating: An Open Letter (1530), particularly the accusation that in Romans 3:28, in the key phrase \u201cfaith alone,\u201d the word \u201calone\u201d is not in Paul\u2019s text. When back in Wittenberg after the\nDiet of Augsburg, Luther was to lecture on Galatians in 1531, lectures\nwhich were published in 1535 and 1538.\n\nIn his last years, Luther continued to fight for his legacy, which\nincluded his mock-reluctant acceptance of an edition of his collected\nworks to which he contributed an only partially reliable preface on\nwhich (as we have seen) some colourful but probably fictional stories\nof his life were to draw\u2014though for all that it remains a\nrevealing document. These years are marred by his vitriolic attacks on\nboth Turks (and thus Islam) and Jews, in a marked change of tone from\nhis earlier more considered and appreciative reflections, which had\nincluded That Jesus Christ was Born a Jew\n(1523)\u2014although his positive remarks are based on hopes of Jewish conversion, while many of his comments in his unpublished lectures\non Psalms had been hostile; partly because those hopes did not materialise, by 1538 Luther was writing Against the\nSabbatarians, a polemic which he was to continue to the end of\nhis life in further anti-Jewish\n texts.[8]\n\nThe end of that life was to come on 18 February 1546, in the town of\nEisleben where he had been born. At the burial ceremony in Wittenberg,\nMelanchthon spoke the eulogy. He noted that while he could not deny\nthe complaint that \u201cLuther displayed too much severity\u201d in\ndealing with his opponents, nonetheless he cited one of those\nopponents in response: \n\n\nBut I answer in the language of Erasmus, \u201cBecause of the\nmagnitude of the disorders, God gave this age a violent\nphysician\u201d. (1546 [1834\u201360: 729\u2013730]; the reference is to Erasmus 1529 [1999: 100])\n\n",
