    "main_text": "The Universal Soul, Universal Intellect and Universal Matter\n4. The Universal Soul, Universal Intellect and Universal Matter\n\nThe soul that Bruno identified as one of the four principles of\ncorporeality was the World or Universal Soul. The universe was an\norganism in which each principal body and the life sustained on it\nparticipated in a common animating principle, in the same way as the\nmany parts of the human body were vivified by one and the same soul.\nEven supposedly inanimate things had a vestigial presence of life.\nRocks, for example, were alive to the same degree as the bones or\nteeth of animals were. The Universal Soul was\n\u201call-in-all\u201d, that is, present wholly and indivisibly in\neach and every thing to the degree that it was capable of receiving\nit, just as, to borrow Plotinus\u2019s analogy\n(Enneads,VI.4.12), a single voice was audible to everyone in\na room, however great the audience. Bruno, like others before him,\nattributed the doctrine of \u201call-in-all\u201d, in a\ndematerialized version, to Anaxagoras. He also adduced several\nscriptural witnesses, notably the Book of Wisdom (1:7), thereby\nidentifying the Universal Soul implicitly with the Holy Spirit:\n\u201cFor the Spirit of the Lord filleth the world: and that which\ncontaineth all things hath knowledge of the voice\u201d. No matter\nthat the Council of Sens (1140) had anathematized this\nassociation.\n\nThe Universal Soul combined with Universal Matter to produce the\nuniverse; the former was the active power, form, and the latter its\npassive subject. Bruno conceived Universal Matter as indeterminate\nspace, that is, the receptacle of Plato\u2019s Timaeus\n(52A\u2013B) or more exactly Aristotle\u2019s interpretation of it\n(Physics, IV.2, 209b6\u201317; IV.6, 214a12\u201319). In\nthis respect, it was the motionless aether or spirit, devoid of any\n\u201cspecific quality\u201d of its own (BOI II, 159\u2013160; BOL\nI.2 78\u201379), that served as the medium through which soul acted\non the two corporeal principles, earth atoms and water (see\n Section 3). Some philosophers, noted Bruno, called\nthis space or container \u201cvacuum\u201d (BOI II,\n160\u2013161). All Universal Matter was \u201caccompanied\u201d by\nform, that is, the Universal Soul (BOI I, 665\u2013666). This simple\npicture was complicated by Bruno\u2019s interpretation of the\nUniversal or, synonymously, First Intellect. Like the Neoplatonic\nIntellect, Bruno\u2019s Universal Intellect comprised the Ideas; but,\nunlike its Neoplatonic counterpart, it was not a hypostasis distinct\nfrom, and ontologically prior to, the Universal Soul. Instead, it was\n\u201cthe inner and most essential and characteristic faculty\u201d\nof the Universal Soul, operating immanently from within Universal\nMatter like \u201can internal craftsman\u201d (BOI I, 652\u2013654;\nBOL I.2, 312\u2013313, 426; I.4, 107). It did so by articulating its\neffects through division: a seed of a tree became a stem, from which\ngrew branches, from which grew twigs, from which grew buds and so\non\u2014to the point of generating a new specimen through separation\nor discharge of some kind.\n\n\n\n\nThe Universal Intellect was, however, simultaneously separate from the\ncorruptible things that it engendered in that it was immutable.\nSpatial language\u2014\u201cabove\u201d,\n\u201cwithin\u201d, \u201cseparate\u201d and so forth\u2014was,\nas Bruno recognized, inappropriate when describing intelligible\nrealities. By definition, something intelligible had no location or\ndimensions. To clarify what he meant by the immanent and transcendent\nroles of the Universal Soul and its faculty, the Universal Intellect,\nBruno appropriated a distinction formulated in Thomas Aquinas\u2019s\nOn the Principles of Nature. Principles were constituents of\nsomething. The marble of the statue and its form were constituents;\nhence, they were principles, the marble being the material, the form\nthe formal principle. Causes, by contrast, were extrinsic. A sculptor\nwas the efficient cause of a statue, and he made it with an end, a\nfinal cause, in mind. Neither the sculptor nor his purpose were\nconstituents of the finished piece. Analogously the Universal Soul and\nUniversal Matter were the two principles immanent in all things,\nwhereas the Universal Intellect was the efficient cause of all things\nand so extrinsic to them. It also operated in accordance with a final\nand therefore extrinsic cause: the perfection of the universe.\n\nThe Stoics, as Bruno knew, had similarly proposed that the cosmos\ncomprised two mutually dependent principles, the World Soul or\npneuma and matter, active and passive respectively, with the\nformer accommodating Mind. Indeed, when introducing his account of the\nUniversal Soul and Universal Matter in On the Cause, the Principle\nand the One (1584), he included the Stoics among the several\nschools and authors who had identified the World Soul and matter as\nthe active and passive principles of the physical world. Stoic\nphilosophy also contributed to Bruno\u2019s doctrine in surreptitious\nways. In the Pimander (chaps 10\u201312) Hermes Trismegistus\nhad declared that the cosmos was composed of matter and soul and that\nthe latter included Mind. Again, Virgil (Aeneid,\nVI.724\u2013727) had described the super- and sublunary regions as\nanimated from within by spiritus, which Bruno identified in\nthis context with the Universal Soul, and added that they were moved\nby a Mind diffused throughout their vast mass. Hermes Trismegistus and\nVirgil were, according to conventional wisdom, reporting the wisdom of\nthe ancient Egyptians and the Pythagoreans respectively. As such,\nBruno considered them authorities for his interpretation. Neither,\nhowever, was authentic. The comments in the Pimander are just\none of many Stoic borrowings that reflect the eclectic intellectual\nambient of Alexandrian Egypt in which Hermetic works of this kind were\ncomposed. And unbeknown to Bruno, Virgil\u2019s lines drew on Stoic\nrather than Pythagorean thought (Knox 2013).\n\nBruno\u2019s two universal principles resembled Stoic doctrine in\nanother respect. For the Stoics, \u201cfirst matter\u201d was an\nunqualified substance (ousia). For Bruno, too, Universal\nMatter was a substance and in act, not a prope nihil\n(\u201calmost nothing\u201d) of the kind imagined by Aristotle. The\nsimilarities, however, cease at this point. For the Stoics, whatever\nexisted, even soul and matter, was corporeal, capable of acting on or\nbeing acted upon by another corporeal entity. By contrast, neither of\nBruno\u2019s principles was corporeal. The Universal Soul was an\nintelligible reality; and Universal Matter was not corporeal in the\nStoic sense. Inherently qualityless, dimensionless, impassive and\ninactive, Universal Matter was a medium that had the potentiality to\nbecome all things. To explain why Universal Matter conceived in this\nmanner was a substance, Bruno drew on Thomas Aquinas\u2019s\ncommentary on Aristotle\u2019s reportage of ideas proposed by\n\u201cancient philosophers\u201d (Commentary on Aristotle\u2019s Physics, II,\nlectio 2, \u00a71). Wood was a substance in act because it\nwas that from which a bed, stool or image could be made, not because\nit was any one of those things; and the same was true of Universal\nMatter. It was not so much the effects elicited from Universal Matter\nby the Universal Soul\u2019s faculty, the Universal Intellect, which\nwere in act, but rather Universal Matter itself. It was in act by\nvirtue of the unexplicated forms that the Universal Intellect could\nincite from within it, not by virtue of the explicated material forms\nthat it produced. Nicholas of Cusa supplied the language of\nexplication and implication.\n\nUniversal Matter was present in incorporeal as well as corporeal\nthings. It was the genus of two types of matter, corporeal and\nintelligible. The former was the substrate of corporeal objects, as\ndescribed above. The latter, Plotinus\u2019s version of Plato\u2019s\nIndefinite Dyad as reported by Aristotle, was instead the\nsubstrate\u2014the principle of indeterminacy or\npotentiality\u2014of intelligible realities. Bruno quoted two of\nPlotinus\u2019s arguments for the existence of intelligible matter.\nFirst, the plurality of Ideas in the Intellect presupposed something\ncommon to each of them, this commonality being intelligible matter.\nSecond, since the sensible world imitated the intelligible world and\nthe sensible world comprised matter, so too must the intelligible.\nPlotinus, like other ancient Neoplatonists, considered the two matters\nontologically distinct, as Bruno noted. Intelligible matter, as the\nmatter of unchanging intelligible realities, did not change,\nPlotinus had explained. It \u201cpossessed\u201d all things simultaneously. By\ncontrast, the matter of sensible things possessed all things only\ninasmuch as parts of it assumed all possible forms sequentially. Bruno\nadded a differentiation of his own, applying again Nicholas of\nCusa\u2019s distinction between explication and implication:\nintelligible matter was informed but unexplicated, sensible matter was\ninformed but explicated. Nevertheless, Bruno insisted that corporeal\nand intelligible matter were, ultimately, two species of the genus\nUniversal Matter. He was not the first to do so. The eleventh-century\nJewish philosopher, Ibn Gabirol or, in Latinized form, Avicebron, as\nBruno mentioned, had made the same move. Just as importantly, even if\nBruno did not say so, so too had Ficino in accordance with\nAugustine\u2019s Plotinian exegesis of Genesis 1:1\u20133. All\ndistinctions, Bruno concluded, presupposed something indefinite:\npotentiality, matter. Hence the distinction between the two matters\npresupposed an absolute Universal Matter. No doubt he knew of Thomas\nAquinas\u2019s objections. Avicebron was wrong, Thomas had written,\nto say that species were the actualization of a genus\u2019s\npotentialities and so attribute existence to what was a purely\ntheoretical relationship between genus and species.\n\nLike Avicebron, Bruno sometimes went as far as to elevate Universal\nMatter above Universal Form. Nothing was \u201cconstant, fixed,\neternal and worthy of being esteemed a principle apart from [Universal]\nMatter\u201d (BOI I, 686). Form, that is, the Universal Soul, was\n\u201cunder the constant control of [Universal] Matter\u201d (BOI I,\n722). Its stability, which\ncontrasted so favorably with the flux of form, had led the heterodox\nscholastic philosopher David of Dinant (d. 1215) \u201cwho had been\npoorly understood by some\u201d to call matter \u201cdivine\u201d\n(BOI I, 601, 723; BOL III, 695\u2013696). Divine though it might be,\nBruno did not identify Universal Matter with God. Indeed, he\ncriticized Avicebron, misrepresenting him on the by, for having held\nthat matter alone was \u201cstable\u201d, \u201ceternal\u201d and\nhence \u201cdivine\u201d and for vilifying all substantial form,\nincluding the Universal Soul, as \u201ccorruptible\u201d and\nephemeral (BOI I, 687, 696). For Bruno, the Universal Soul was\n\u201cmutable\u201d, rather than \u201ccorruptible\u201d, in\nrelation to Universal Matter and only in this sense inferior to\nit (ibid.).\n",
