    "main_text": "Logical Positivism\n4. Logical Positivism\n\nStebbing played a major role in introducing logical positivism into\nBritain. She first met Moritz Schlick in Oxford in 1930 when they\nspoke in a panel together at the Seventh International Congress of\nPhilosophy, and Schlick came to England again in 1932 to lecture at\nKing\u2019s College London. In 1934 she invited Rudolf Carnap to give\na series of three lectures (later published as Philosophy and\nLogical Syntax) in London, where Carnap met Russell and A. J.\nAyer for the first time. She was on the organization committee for the\nInternational Congress for the Unity of Science, which was held in\nParis in 1935 and in Cambridge in 1938.\n\nWhat Stebbing found attractive in logical positivism was its respect\nfor science and the value it placed on logic. What she rejected was\nits repudiation of metaphysics. (She endorsed the\n\u201clogical\u201d and \u201cempiricism\u201d but not the\n\u201cpositivism\u201d, in other words, of the movement for which\nboth \u201clogical empiricism\u201d and \u201clogical\npositivism\u201d are used as names, more or less interchangeably.) We\ncan see her 1932 paper, \u201cThe Method of Analysis in\nMetaphysics\u201d, as seeking to defend the conception of\nmetaphysical analysis of the Cambridge School in response to the\nlogical positivists\u2019 critique of metaphysics. But it is in a\npaper she read to the British Academy in March 1933, \u201cLogical\nPositivism and Analysis\u201d, that she attempts to engage directly\nwith logical positivism and say what she finds objectionable about it.\nShe takes \u201clogical positivism\u201d to include the views of\nWittgenstein, as filtered through the reports and writings of various\nmembers of the Vienna Circle such as Schlick, Carnap, and Friedrich\nWaismann. Focusing especially on Carnap, she criticizes his conception\nof \u201clogically constructed systems\u201d (as found in his\nAufbau of 1928, for example) for being too abstract. However\nuseful such a system may be in showing what can be constructed with\nthe fewest possible assumptions and primitive terms, she argues, the\nworld itself is not such a system. She also attacks Carnap\u2019s\n\u201cmethodological solipsism\u201d on what she calls \u201cthe\nbest of grounds \u2026 namely, that I know it to be\nfalse\u201d (1933a: 77).\n\nStebbing\u2019s assertion of what she knows is hardly likely\nto be seen by anyone other than a committed Moorean as a knockdown\nargument against any form of solipsism. She goes on to accuse\nWittgenstein, and the logical positivists who were influenced by him,\nof confusing \u201cdirect experience\u201d and\n\u201ccontent\u201d, but no evidence is offered for saddling\nWittgenstein with the views she claims he had. However, in the last\nquarter of the paper, she makes clear that what is really at issue, in\nher view, is a conflict between two different conceptions of analysis,\nwhich she calls \u201cdirectional analysis\u201d and\n\u201cpostulational analysis\u201d. Directional analysis is the form\nof analysis that she had attempted to defend in her 1932 paper.\nPostulational analysis is what is used \u201cin the construction of a\ndeductive system\u201d (1933a: 80). Axioms are stipulated and\neverything else in the system is derived by the rules of\ninference.\n\nWhat Stebbing means by a constructed system here is a system that is\npostulated as a replacement for a conceptual system used in\nour everyday life\u2014in the way that set theory might be seen as\npostulating a replacement for our ordinary system of arithmetic. On\nthis view, our everyday concepts and propositions are vague and need\nto be replaced\u2014or \u201cexplicated\u201d, to use\nCarnap\u2019s later term\u2014by precisely defined concepts, clearly\nstated axioms and logically derived propositions. Stebbing\u2019s\nfundamental objection to this conception of postulational or\nexplicatory analysis is that it misunderstands the role of analysis,\nwhich is \u201cto understand something more clearly\u201d (1933a:\n81). Simply replacing our ordinary vague concepts by precise ones does\nnot genuinely show what it was we understood. Consider, for example,\nthe \u201creplacement\u201d of our ordinary concepts of colour by\nconcepts scientifically defined in terms of the wavelengths of light,\netc. Arguably, this can never do justice to what it is we experience\nwhen we see colours and describe them in the ordinary ways we do: it\ndoes not capture the phenomenology of our experience. In the same way,\nwe might question whether defining numbers as sets genuinely shows\nwhat we \u201creally mean\u201d by number terms.\n\nAccording to Stebbing, the logical positivists\u2014and she\nspecifically mentions Schlick in this regard\u2014put \u201cthe\npursuit of meaning\u201d before the determination of the truth-value\nof propositions (1933a: 83). But this gets things precisely the wrong\nway around, on Stebbing\u2019s Moorean view: we begin with\npropositions that we understand (in some sense) and can know\nto be true, and in seeking an analysis of these propositions, we aim\nto clarify that understanding by identifying the facts that make them\ntrue or false. This is precisely the conception of analysis that she\nhad attempted to articulate and defend in her 1932 paper. On the\nexplicatory conception (as Stebbing seems to construe it), on the\nother hand, we postulate something with a meaning that is\nintended to be clear once and for all, with the aim of thereby guiding\nor constraining our subsequent determinations of the truth-value of\nthe relevant propositions.\n\nAt the very end of her lecture, in explaining how she disagrees with\nthe \u201clinguistic\u201d approach of Wittgenstein and the logical\npositivists, Stebbing summarises her view as follows:\n\n\nWhat we ordinarily say, we say unclearly. We speak unclearly because\nwe think unclearly. It is the task of philosophy to render our\nthoughts clear. \u2026 We cannot clarify our thoughts by thinking\nabout thinking, nor by thinking about logic. We have to think\nabout what we were thinking about. The philosopher\nconsiders a given expression, and analyses it in order to\nfind another expression which says more clearly what\nthe original expression said less clearly. This investigation\nis not linguistic. We must first know what facts are the case\nbefore we can fruitfully employ analysis for the purpose of clarifying\nour thoughts about the world. Accordingly, Logical Positivism fails, I\nthink, in so far as it attempts to start from a priori\nassumptions with regard to the nature of language and the principles\nof symbolism, and, by means of these, to draw limits with regard to\nwhat we can think. Their mistake is that they seek to make\neverything clear at once. But it is not in this way that\nphilosophy can develop. We must proceed step by step, beginning with\npropositions which we know to be true, not ruling out\ninitially what does not fit in. (1933a: 86)\n\n\nWhat emerges from the two papers that Stebbing wrote on analysis in\n1932 and 1933? As she admitted herself, some of her arguments might\nwell seem unconvincing or inconclusive. On the one hand, she confesses\nthat she can find no justification for the presuppositions of\ndirectional analysis, her favoured form of analysis, at least as far\nas the commitment to \u201cbasic facts\u201d is concerned. On the\nother hand, her objection to postulational analysis seems to amount,\nat times, to no more than the charge that it is not directional\nanalysis. (For a fuller account of her critique of logical positivism,\nsee Beaney 2016.) In attempting to clarify both directional analysis\nand postulational analysis, and to defend the former and criticise the\nlatter, however, she helped sharpen the issues in dispute between the\nCambridge School and logical positivism. Furthermore, by encouraging\ndialogue between the two, in both her writings and her organizational\nactivities, she also helped foster that critical engagement between\nthe \u201cordinary language\u201d and \u201cideal language\u201d\nwings of analytic philosophy, as they later came to be called, which\nhas continued to this day. In short, what she promoted, above all, was\ncritical reflection on the nature of analysis and hence of the\nessential characteristics of the two main schools of thought that were\nto come together under the heading of \u201canalytic\nphilosophy\u201d.\n",
