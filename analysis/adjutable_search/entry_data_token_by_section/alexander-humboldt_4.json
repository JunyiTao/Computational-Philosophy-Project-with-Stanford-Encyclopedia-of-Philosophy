    "main_text": "Life and Works || Berlin\n1.5 Berlin\n\nHumboldt moved to Berlin in 1827 at the behest of the Prussian King.\nIt was at the University of Berlin that Humboldt delivered his famous\nKosmos lectures (seventy-seven in total), between 3 November 1827, and\n27 April 1828. Although Humboldt planned to publish the lectures soon\nafter delivering them, it took another two decades before he began\npublishing his five-volume Kosmos: eine physische\nWetlbeschreibung [Cosmos: A Physical Description of the\nWorld] (1845\u20131862). The final volume was published\nposthumously.\n\nAs both the title and subtitle indicate, Humboldt\u2019s goals are\ndistinctive. The dual significance of the term\ncosmos\u2014which in ancient Greek means elegance and\nworld\u2014implies that Humboldt\u2019s goal is to understand nature\nand capture its beauty. As he puts it, the word\n\u201cKosmos\u201d signifies both the \u201corder of the\nworld, and adornment [Schmuck] of this universal\norder\u2026\u201d (Kosmos 1: 33; CO 1 69n). This goes hand\nin hand with Humboldt\u2019s larger vision of the world as a dynamic\nand harmonious unity of interrelated parts.\n\nIn Berlin, Humboldt assumed the role of court advisor, and often\ntravelled on diplomatic missions. Despite his proximity to the King,\nHumboldt was supportive of the King\u2019s critics, including Bettina\nBrentano von Arnim (1785\u20131859), who had been sentenced to prison\non account of her evasion of publication laws. Humboldt helped to\nabsolve her of the sentence. Furthermore, Humboldt used his connection\nto help American slaves. With Humboldt\u2019s prodding, the Prussian\nKing enacted a law in 1857 that any slave would become free once on\nPrussian soil.\n",
