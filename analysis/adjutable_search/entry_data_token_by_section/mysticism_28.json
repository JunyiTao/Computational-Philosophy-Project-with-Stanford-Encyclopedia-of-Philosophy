    "main_text": "Epistemology || Scientific Studies: Meditation and Psychedelics\n9.7 Scientific Studies: Meditation and Psychedelics\n\nVarious psychological explanations of mystical experiences, both their\nnature and their causes, have been offered. These include\npathological conditions such as hyper-suggestibility, severe\ndeprivation, severe sexual frustration, intense fear of death,\ninfantile regression, pronounced maladjustment, and mental illness, as\nwell as non-pathological conditions, including the inordinate\ninfluence of a religious mental \u201cset\u201d (see\nWulff 2000). In addition, some have advanced a sociological\nexplanation for some mysticism in terms of the socio-political\npower available to an accomplished mystic (Fales 1996a\nand 1996b).\n\nIn the 1990\u2019s, interest revived in studying meditation and psychedelic\ndrugs to see what they may reveal about how the brain works. Different\nmeditative techniques (especially mindfulness meditations) are now\nbeing studied through neuroimaging to gain data on the brain activity\noccurring during these experiences and practices. (For an overview,\nsee Schjoedt 2009.) Losing a sense of a phenomenal \u201cself\u201d\nnecessarily alters our ordinary ego-driven state of consciousness.\n(See Milli\u00e8re et al. 2018 for an overview on different senses\nof \u201closs of self\u201d and their phenomenological\ndifferences.) Thus, the phenomenology of mystical\nexperiences also has become an important subject for the\nstudy of consciousness. As noted in Section 8, neuroscientists are\nfinding unique patterns of brain activity during mystical\nexperiences. Different neurophysiological effects and unique\npatterns of brain activity have also been detected in mindfulness\npractices and in introvertive concentration practices (Hood 1997\nand 2001; Dunn, Hartigan, and Mikulas 1999). The\nneurological effects of concentration differ from those\nof mindfulness meditation (Valentine and Sweet 1999). This\nsuggests as strongly as neuroscience can that the\nmystical experiences enabled by meditation differ from more\nordinary experiences and our normal waking state of consciousness and\nthat the effects of different types of meditations are\ndistinguishable. Possible neural correlates of different mystical\nfeatures \u2014 a loss of a sense of self, a sense of connectedness\nto others, a feeling of certainty, feeling the experience has great\nsignificance, loss of a sense of time \u2014 have been identified.\nFor example, a loss of a sense of self is correlated to the decrease\nof activity in the brain connected to a sense of self and a sense of\nseparation from the world.\n\nThe study of the mystical experiences enabled by psychedelics (in\nparticular, psilocybin and LSD) is now also a major topic (Barlett and\nGriffiths 2018). Psychedelics are reported to occasion some of the\nmost spiritually significant experiences in the life of the\nparticipants (Doblin 1991). There is also the clinical study of\npsychedelics in therapy for such conditions as depression\nand addiction that are resistant to more conventional forms of\ntherapy. An important issue is whether the positive effects of a\npsychedelic drug on a patient\u2019s well-being are the result solely of\nthe chemical effect of the drug on the brain or whether the\nmystical experiences enabled by the drugs are also a necessary part of\nthe treatment. \n\nThis research leads to philosophical issues. Does brain activity\nalone cause these experiences, or does meditation or a\npsychedelic drug merely disrupt our normal state of\nconsciousness thereby enabling new experiences to arise that\nare not caused by brain activity itself? If the former, can the\nalleged cognitive content of mystical experiences be discounted\nbecause mystical experiences are reduced to \u201cmerely brain events\u201d? If\nthe latter, does the same brain state underlie different\nmeditation and psychedelic-enabled experiences? If so, the\nsituation is the opposite of the \u201cmultiple realization\u201d problem in\nphilosophy of mind: multiple experiences are connected to the same\nbrain state. So too, the question remains of whether\nneuroscientists are actually studying mystical experiences at all by\nstudying neural activity correlated with them. (See Jones 2018, 2016,\nchap. 9.) Concerning psychedelics, the most\nimportant question is whether the mystical experiences\nenabled by psychedelics are mere hallucinations that are no more\ncognitive than the LSD-induced distortions of perception.\nAnother important question is whether the experiences enabled by\nthe drugs are the same as \u201cnatural\u201d mystical experiences\nor only pale copies. And does the fact that such experiences can\nbe touched off fairly consistently by drugs with the proper dosage and\na conducive \u201cset and setting\u201d for the participant\nmean that the experiences are only products of the brain? Or\ndo the drugs only set up new conditions in the brain\nenabling new experiences to occur that are not caused by brain\nactivity? (See Smith 1964 and 2005; Letheby 2021;\nJones 2019.)\n",
