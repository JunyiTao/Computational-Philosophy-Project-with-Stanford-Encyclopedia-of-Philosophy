    "main_text": "Neurobiological Theories of Consciousness || Higher-Order Theory\n3.3 Higher-Order Theory\n\nA long-standing approach to conscious states holds that one is in a\nconscious state if and only if one relevantly represents oneself as\nbeing in such a state. For example, one is in a conscious visual state\nof seeing a moving object if and only if one suitably represents oneself\nbeing in that visual state. This higher-order state, in representing\nthe first-order state that represents the world, results in the first\norder state\u2019s being conscious as opposed to not. The intuitive\nrationale for such theories is that if one were in a visual state but\nin no way aware of that state, then the visual state would not be\nconscious. Thus, to be in a conscious state, one must be aware of it,\ni.e., represent it (see the entry on\n higher order theories of consciousness;\n Rosenthal 2002). Higher-order theories merge with empirical work by\ntying high-order representations with activity in prefrontal cortex\nwhich is taken to be the neural substrate of the required higher-order\nrepresentations. On certain higher-order theories, one can be in a\nconscious visual state even if there is no visual system activity, so\nlong as one represents oneself as being in that state.\n\nThe focus on prefrontal cortex allows for empirical tests of the\nhigher-order theory as against other accounts (Lau & Rosenthal\n2011). For example, on the higher-order theory, lesions to prefrontal\ncortex should affect consciousness (Kozuch 2014), testing the\nnecessity of prefrontal cortex for consciousness. Against higher-order\ntheories, some reports claim that patients with prefrontal cortex\nsurgically removed maintain preserved perceptual consciousness (Boly\net al. 2017). This would lend support to recurrent processing theories\nthat hold that prefrontal cortical activity is not necessary for\nconsciousness. It is not clear, however, that the interventions\nsucceeded in removing all of prefrontal cortex, leaving\nperhaps sufficient frontal areas needed to sustain consciousness\n(Odegaard, Knight, & Lau 2017). Bilateral suppression of\nprefrontal activity using transcranial magnetic stimulation also seems\nto selectively impair visibility as evidenced by metacognitive report\n(Rounis et al. 2010). Furthermore, certain syndromes and experimental\nmanipulations suggest consciousness in the absence of appropriate\nsensory processing as predicted by some higher-order accounts (Lau\n& Brown forthcoming), a claim that coheres with the theory\u2019s sufficiency\nclaims.\n",
