    "main_text": "Nobility as a function of causes\n3. Nobility as a function of causes\n\nMarinella draws on both Platonist and Aristotelian accounts of\ncausation, interpreted through ancient, medieval, and Renaissance\ncommentators (she cites Plotinus, Lombard, Ebreo, and Ficino), when\nshe argues that women are superior to men with respect to the causes\nthat have generated them. Aristotle had posited four kinds of cause:\nmaterial, formal, efficient, and final. In the case of an unqualified\nchange, such as the generation of a substance (e.g., a person or a\nsquirrel), the causes can be understood as follows: the material cause\nis the stuff out of which the substance is made, which remains as a\nconstituent of the substance; the formal cause is the principle of\norganization that bestows on the individual substance both its form\nand its function, making it a member of a natural kind, with the\ncharacteristic properties and behaviors of that kind; the efficient\ncause initiates the process of generation; the final cause is the aim\nor end point of the process, which will often be in effect the same as\nthe formal cause, because the aim of a process of generation is the\nmature and perfected form and function of the substance. Consider the\nexample of the generation of an individual belonging to a natural\nkind, the squirrel (a natural substance). The material cause of the\nsquirrel is the flesh, bone, blood, etc. from which the squirrel is\nconstituted; the formal cause of the squirrel is its shape and\nfunction; the efficient cause of the squirrel is the male parent of\nthat squirrel (because, on Aristotle\u2019s view it is the male\nparent that initiates the process of generation of offspring); and the\nfinal cause is to be a mature squirrel and carry out the functions of\na squirrel (whatever those may prove to be).\n\nMarinella, following this tradition, distinguishes the\n\u201cefficient or productive cause\u201d from the material cause in\nthe production of every creature, among which she includes woman, and\nman. On her view, all created things (for example, all angels,\nheavenly bodies, people, elements\u2014earth, water, fire and\nair\u2014and animals) ultimately have the same productive or\nefficient cause, namely God. With respect to the efficient cause,\nthen, created things differ not at all. But there are distinctions in\nworth among created kinds (and also among individuals, insofar as the\ncauses of two individuals of the same kind might differ), and these\ndistinctions are a function of the differences in the ideas of God,\nwhom Marinella compares to an architect or painter, who effects the\nproduction of buildings or art-works through the formulation of an\nidea or plan. The ideas are the formal causes, which, as we have seen,\nare the principles of organization that bestow on the individual\nsubstance both its form and its function; these produce the different\nkinds of creatures, and the differences among individuals within a\nkind. On this account, then, God\u2019s creative process resembles\nthe production of artifacts: in the same way that the painter will\nhave better and worse ideas (in the sense that the ideas for the\npaintings will be ideas of better and worse things), so too God will\nhave ideas of better and worse things that he brings into being: what\nGod creates is not of uniform value. (The conception of\n\u2018ideas\u2019 here, while clearly Platonic in origin, parallels\nAristotelian formal causes.)\n\nIn describing the important differences among ideas in the mind of\nGod, and hence among formal causes, Marinella adverts in particular to\nthe different purposes that different kinds are to serve:\n\n\nThat same courteous hand created angels, heavens, men, and the rude,\ndull earth, all in varying degrees of perfection\u2026.It is the\ncreator who decides which things are of less value and which are\nworthier, and more particularly, which have a less noble purpose and\nwhich a more remarkable one. (Marinella 1601b, 52 (references to\nMarinella are all to 1601b))\n\n\nThat is, while God as the productive cause of every created thing is\none and the same, the formal causes\u2014the ideas in the mind of\nGod\u2014will be different, and of different value. Moreover, the\nends to which the productive cause, God, intended to put each creature\nare different, and so the final causes responsible for the creation of\ndifferent creatures will also be different. Marinella does not\nimmediately conclude that women are superior to men; rather she\nconcludes that it is possible:\n\n\nDifferent degrees of perfection can be found, therefore\u2026in\neverything in the world\u2026If this is the case\u2026why should\nnot woman be nobler than man and have a rarer and more excellent\npurpose than he, as indeed can be manifestly understood from her\nnature? (1601b, 53) \n\n\nIn other words, if (i) the ideas of created kinds in God\u2019s mind\ndiffer with respect to the intrinsic worth of the kind and with\nrespect to the purpose of the kind, and if (ii) God\u2019s idea of\nwoman was different from God\u2019s idea of man and so women have a\ndifferent divinely determined purpose from that of men\u2014then\n(iii) it is possible that women are nobler than men.\n\nWomen and men might then be different with respect to the idea and\npurpose (the formal and final causes) in the mind of God, but they are\nnot different with respect to the efficient cause that brings them\ninto being\u2014God himself. Marinella\u2019s discussion of the\nfourth kind of cause, the material cause, forms an important part of\nher argument, in which she makes a number of distinct points about the\nbody as material cause of the ensouled being. She believes women are\nbetter than men with respect to the material cause, first citing an\nargument made by Christine de Pizan and restated by Agrippa: because\nwoman was created from the rib of man, and man was already an ensouled\nbeing, and hence a living being, the material cause of woman is better\nthan that of man, who was made from earth, which is lifeless\n matter.[2]\n This argument depends on the implicit premise that ensouled beings\nare superior to inanimate beings, but that was a view of the hierarchy\nof being current since antiquity, and so one that Marinella believes\nherself entitled to use. This is only the first demonstration of the\nsuperiority of women\u2019s bodies to men; Marinella has quite a lot\nto add on the subject of the material or bodily superiority of women\n(discussed in\n Section 5 below),\n insofar as that superiority is a sign or mark of a better soul.\n",
