Thought and Language\n\nTo say that a mental object has semantic properties is,\nparadigmatically, to say that it is about, or true or false\nof, an object or objects, or that it is true or false\nsimpliciter. Suppose I think that democracy is dying. I am\nthinking about democracy, and if what I think of it (that it is dying)\nis true of it, then my thought is true. According to RTM such states\nare to be explained as relations between agents and mental\nrepresentations. To think that democracy is dying is to token in some\nway a mental representation whose content is that democracy is dying.\nOn this view, the semantic properties of mental states are the\nsemantic properties of the representations they are relations to.\n\nLinguistic acts seem to share such properties with mental states.\nSuppose I say that democracy is dying. I am talking about\ndemocracy, and if what I say of it (that it is dying) is true of it,\nthen my utterance is true. Now, to say that democracy is dying is (in\npart) to utter a sentence that means that democracy is dying. Many\nphilosophers have thought that the semantic properties of linguistic\nexpressions are inherited from the intentional mental states they are\nconventionally used to express (Grice 1957, Fodor 1978,\nSchiffer1972/1988, Searle 1983). On this view, the semantic properties\nof linguistic expressions are the semantic properties of the\nrepresentations that are the mental relata of the states they are\nconventionally used to express. Fodor has famously argued that these\nstates themselves have a language-like structure. (See the entry on\nthe\n  language of thought hypothesis.)\n \n\n(Others, however, e.g., Davidson (1975, 1982) have suggested that the\nkind of thought human beings are capable of is not possible without\nlanguage, so that the dependency might be reversed, or somehow mutual\n(see also Sellars 1956). (But see Martin 1987 for a defense of the\nclaim that thought is possible without language. See also Chisholm and\nSellars 1958.) Schiffer (1987) subsequently despaired of the success\nof what he calls \u201cIntention-Based Semantics.\u201d)\n\nIt is also widely held that in addition to having such properties as\nreference, truth-conditions and truth \u2013 so-called\nextensional properties \u2013 expressions of natural\nlanguages also have intensional properties, in virtue of\nexpressing properties or propositions \u2013 i.e., in virtue of\nhaving meanings or senses, where two expressions may\nhave the same reference, truth-conditions or truth value, yet express\ndifferent properties or propositions (Frege 1892/1997). If the\nsemantic properties of natural-language expressions are inherited from\nthe thoughts and concepts they express (or vice versa, or both), then\nan analogous distinction may be appropriate for mental\nrepresentations.\n",
