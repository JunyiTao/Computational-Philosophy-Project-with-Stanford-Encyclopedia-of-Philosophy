    "main_text": "The Metaphysics of the Rational Soul; Practical Philosophy\n5. Conclusion\n\nAvicenna synthesized the various strands of philosophical thought he inherited\u2014the surviving Hellenic traditions along with the developments in philosophy and theology within Islam\u2014into a self-consistent scientific system that explained all reality. His scientific edifice rested on Aristotelian physics and metaphysics capped with Neoplatonic emanationism in the context of Ptolemaic cosmology, all revised, re-thought, and critically re-assessed by him. His achievement consisted in his harmonization of the disparate parts into a rational whole, and particularly in bringing the sublunar and supralunar worlds into an intelligible relation for which he argued logically. The system was therefore both a research program and a worldview.\n\nAristotelian ethics provided the foundation of the edifice. The imperative to know, and to know rationally, which is the motivation behind Avicenna\u2019s conception and then realization of his scientific system, is based on Aristotle\u2019s concept of happiness as the activity of that which differentiates humans from all other organic life, of the mind (Nicomachean Ethics X.7, 1177b19\u201325): \u201cthe activity of the intellect is thought to be distinguished by hard work (spoud\u00ea, ijtih\u0101d), since it employs theory, and it does not desire to have any other end at all except itself; and it has its proper pleasure \u2026. Complete happiness (eudaimonia, sa\u02bf\u0101da) is \n this.\u201d[8] \n Avicenna subscribed fully to this view of human happiness in this world, and extended it to make it also the basis for happiness in the next\u2014as a matter of fact, he made it a prerequisite for happiness in the next. Only the contemplative life while in the body prepares the intellect, which has to use the corporeal external and internal senses to acquire knowledge and gain the predisposition for thinking the intelligibles, for the contemplative life after death. In understanding the goal of human life in this manner Avicenna was again being true to the Aristotelian view of divine happiness as the identity of thinker, thinking, and thought (Metaphysics XII.7, 1072b18\u201326). Using the words of Aristotle, Avicenna paraphrases this passage as follows: \u201cAs for the foremost \u2018understanding (no\u00easis, fahm) in itself, it is of what is best in itself;\u2019 and as for \u2018what understands itself, it is\u2019 the substance \u2018of the intellect as it acquires the intelligible, because it becomes intelligible\u2019 right away just as if \u2018it touches it,\u2019 for example. \u2018And the intellect,\u2019 that which intellects, \u2018and the intelligible are one and the same\u2019 with regard to the essence of the thing as it relates to itself\u2026. \u2018And if the deity<\u2019s state> is always like the state in which we sometimes are, then this is marvelous; and if it is more, then it is even more marvelous\u2019\u201d \n (Geoffroy et al. 2014, 59).[9] \n\nThere is thus a deeply ethical aspect to Avicenna\u2019s philosophical system. The core conception was the life of the rational soul: because our theoretical intellects\u2014our selves\u2014are consubstantial with the celestial intellects, it is our cosmic duty to enable our intellects to reach their full potential and behave like the celestial ones, that is, think the intelligibles (cf. Lizzini 2009). And because we (i.e. our essential core which identifies us and survives, our rational souls) are given a body and our materiality hampers our unencumbered intellection like that enjoyed by the First and the other celestial beings, we have to tend to the body by all means, behavioral (religious practices, ethical conduct) and pharmacological, to bring its humoral temperament to a level of equilibrium that will help the function of the intellect in this life and prepare it for unimpeded and continuous intellection, like that of the deity, in the next. This is humanist ethics dictated by a scientific view of the world.\n",
