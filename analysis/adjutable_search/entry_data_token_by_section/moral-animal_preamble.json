    "main_text": "\n\nIs there something distinctive about humanity that justifies the idea\nthat humans have moral status while non-humans do not? Providing an\nanswer to this question has become increasingly important among\nphilosophers as well as those outside of philosophy who are interested\nin our treatment of non-human animals. For some, answering this\nquestion will enable us to better understand the nature of human\nbeings and the proper scope of our moral obligations. Some argue that\nthere is an answer that can distinguish humans from the rest of the\nnatural world. Many of those who accept this answer are interested in\njustifying certain human practices towards non-humans\u2014practices\nthat cause pain, discomfort, suffering and death. This latter group\nexpects that in answering the question in a particular way, humans\nwill be justified in granting moral consideration to other humans that\nis neither required nor justified when considering non-human animals.\nIn contrast to this view, an increasing number of philosophers have\nargued that while humans are different in a variety of ways from each\nother and other animals, these differences do not provide a\nphilosophical defense for denying non-human animals moral\nconsideration. What the basis of moral consideration is and what it\namounts to has been the source of much disagreement.\n",
