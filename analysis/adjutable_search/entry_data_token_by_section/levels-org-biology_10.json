In this theoretical framework,\nlevels and hierarchies are taken synonymously to be fundamentally\nimportant ontological features of nature:\n\n\nBiological evolutionary theory is ontologically committed to the\nexistence of nested hierarchies in nature and attempts to explain\nnatural phenomena as a product of complex dynamics of real\nhierarchical systems. (T\u00ebmkin & Eldredge 2015: 184)\n\n\nIn the hierarchy theory of evolution, a distinction is made between\ntwo types of hierarchies and the corresponding levels (Eldredge 1996;\nVrba & Eldredge 1984): The ecological and the\ngenealogical hierarchy. In both kinds of hierarchies,\nhigher-level things are formed through specific interactions among\nlower-level things. In the ecological hierarchy, these interactions\nare exchanges of matter and energy, such as consuming and gathering\nresources, and in this hierarchy, we find things such as cells,\norganisms, and ecosystems. In the genealogical hierarchy, the defining\nactivity through which levels are formed is the transmission of\ninformation through replication, and the hierarchy includes things\nsuch as cells, organisms, demes and species. (Note that cells and\norganisms appear in both hierarchies, but in the ecological hierarchy\nthey are seen as interactors, whereas in the genealogical hierarchy\nthey are seen as replicators.) Work on this hierarchy theory of\nevolution is ongoing (see, e.g., Eldredge et al. 2016; T\u00ebmkin\n2021).\n",
