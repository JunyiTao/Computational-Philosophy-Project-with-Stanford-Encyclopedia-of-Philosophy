The necessity of the past and Aristotelian solutions\n\nIt is possible, it seems, to reply to the arguments for fatalism which\nwe have considered so far, without appealing to the Aristotelian\nsolution. We can reject the theory of truth which is crucial to\nAristotle\u2019s argument; we can reject the idea that all statements\nwhich are about the past are necessary; we can reject Taylor\u2019s\naccount of the conditions of power. And we can do this without\nquestioning the idea that we cannot affect the past, except, at any\nrate, in the rather ill-defined collection of cases to which Ockham\ndraws our attention. However, it is open to the fatalist to argue that\nwe have no good reason for making the distinction we do between\naffecting the past and affecting the future. So, if we accept that we\ncannot affect the past, we ought also to accept that we cannot affect\nthe future. Of course, this cuts both ways. We might equally come to\nthe conclusion, in the absence of a good reason for making the\ndistinction, that since we can affect the future we can also affect\nthe past; or, if that seems outrageous, we could affect the past if\nnatural laws did not prevent our doing so.\n\nThis objection by the fatalist is surely right about one thing.\nIf we cannot affect the past, it would be good to know\nwhy we cannot. One possible answer would be that which an\nA-theorist of time might give, namely that there is a fundamental\nontological difference between the future on the one hand and the\npresent and past on the other, which consists in the fact that the\npresent and past are real or actual, while the future is not. And it\nis this fact, that the future is not real or actual, which means that\nit is open, can be affected by what happens now; and it is the fact\nthat the present and past are real or actual which means that they\ncannot be affected by what happens now (Lucas 1989a, Tooley 1997).\n\nSuch accounts, as we have noted above, seem to support the\nAristotelian solution. But they are not the only accounts. On some\naccounts there is no such fundamental ontological difference between\nthe future and the present and past; the impossibility of affecting\nthe past lies not in the fact that the passage of time puts a\nconstraint on what can be caused, but rather in the fact that it is\nthe direction of causation which determines the direction of time\n(Swinburne 1994, Mellor 1981 and 1998). On yet other accounts the\nimpossibility is simply a fundamental metaphysical fact which is not\nopen to further analysis or explanation.\n\nIt is, of course, possible that the fatalist challenge about the\ndifference between the future and the present and past cannot be\nsuccessfully met. For instance, it could be argued (a) that the only\nsuccessful answer would be one which appealed to a fundamental\nontological distinction between the future and the present and past,\nbut that (b) there is in fact no such distinction (Shanks 1994;\ndiscussed in Oaklander 1998). But, as we have noted, even if this\nchallenge cannot be met, it does not show that the fatalist is\ncorrect. The possibility remains that we can, in principle, affect the\npast.\n",
