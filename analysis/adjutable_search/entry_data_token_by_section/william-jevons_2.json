    "main_text": "Logic\n3. Logic\n\n Like many other logicians of the 19th century, Jevons\nwants to establish clear links between mathematics and logic. He would\nlike to derive mathematics from logic, which is based on the Laws of\nThought, and in doing so he makes (a rather controversial) use of\nmathematical symbols when establishing his logical formalism.  Jevons\ndenotes terms by capital letters A, B, C,\netc. and their negative counterparts by small italic letters\na,b,c, etc. The relation of identity or sameness is\nrepresented by the sign \u2018=\u2019. The expression\n\u2018A ~ B\u2019 indicates that A and\nB are not identical with each other; \u2018A \u00a7\nB\u2019 indicates that there exists any relation between\nA and B, which includes but is not restricted to the\nrelations of equality or inequality. The general formula of logical\ninference implies that from A = B \u00a7 C\nwe can conclude that A \u00a7 C.  Jevons defines the\nconcept \u2018term\u2019 in his Pure Logic:\n\u201cTerm will be used to mean name, or any\ncombination of names and words describing the qualities and\ncircumstances of a thing\u201d. Jevons distinguishes between the\nextent and the intent of a term or a name. \u201cThe objects denoted\nform the extent of meaning of the term; the qualities implied\nform the intent of meaning\u201d. It follows that extent and\nintent of meaning are negatively correlated: when more qualities are\nadded to the meaning of a term, less objects will correspond to that\nmeaning. Abstract qualities, denoted by abstract terms, originate when\nobjects are compared and resemblances and differences\nidentified. Abstract terms possess only one kind of\nmeaning. Substantial terms, such as \u2018gold\u2019, denote\nsubstances. Nothing is denoted by the symbol \u20180\u2019, which in\nlogic means \u201cthe non-existent, the impossible, the\nself-inconsistent, the inconceivable\u201d. Jevons lists several\n\u201cspecial laws\u201d which govern the combination of terms.  The\n\u201cLaw of Simplicity\u201d implies that a term combined with\nitself has no effect, hence A = AA = AAA =\netc. The law of commutativeness indicates that the order of the\ncombination does not matter, hence AB = BA,\nABC = ACB = BCA = etc.\n\n The truths of science are expressed in the form of propositions. \n\u201cPropositions may assert an identity of time, space, manner,\nquantity, degree, or any other circumstance in which things may agree\nor differ\u201d (Jevons 1874: 36). Simple propositions A\n= B express the most elementary judgment regarding\nidentity. The use of the mathematical symbol \u2018=\u2019\nimplies that the distinction between subject and predicate vanishes,\nwhich makes quantification of the predicate possible. Several\nlogicians opted for what Jevons calls the \u201cindeterminate\nadjective\u201d \u2018some\u2019, represented symbolically by\n\u2018V\u2019. Jevons rejects the usage of indeterminate\nsymbols and suggests that A = VB (All As are\nsome Bs) should be written as A = AB. \nPropositions of this kind express an identity between a part of\nB and the whole of A.\n\n Direct inference consists of applying the \u2018substitution of\nsimilars\u2019 to certain premises in order to arrive at logical\nconclusions. Jevons lists several forms of inference:\n\nimmediate inference (A=B implies\nAC=BC);\ninference with two simple identities(B=A and\nB=C imply A=C);\nwith a simple and a partial identity(A = B and\nB = BC imply A = AC);\nof a partial from two partial identities(A = AB and\nB = BC imply A = ABC);\nof a simple from two partial identities(A = AB and\nB = AB imply A = B);\nof a limited from two partial identities(B = AB and\nB = CB imply AB = CB);\nand miscellaneous forms of deductive inference.\n\n\n Jevons indicates that traditional syllogistic forms such as Barbara,\nCelarent, Darii etc. can be represented easily in his logical\nsystem. It is also convenient to represent more complicated\ncases, such as inferences derived from more than two premises.\n\n\nDisjunctive propositions are used whenever an abstract term is\n\u2018developed\u2019 in its constituent parts or subclasses \u2013\nwhenever the extent of meaning of a term is explored. In order to\nrepresent disjunctive propositions, Jevons suggests to use the symbol\n\u2018\u00b7|\u00b7\u2019. The words \u2018and\u2019 and\n\u2018or\u2019, used in everyday language, can denote exclusive or\ninexclusive alternatives, but Jevons' symbol\n\u2018\u00b7|\u00b7\u2019 refers to alternatives that are not\nexclusive. The law of unity, A \u00b7|\u00b7 A =\nA, reveals an imperfect analogy between mathematics and\nlogic. In his earliest work on logic Jevons used the symbol\n\u2018+\u2019 instead of \u2018\u00b7|\u00b7\u2019, but in\nThe Principles of Science he recognises that the analogy\nbetween logic and mathematics is imperfect.  Contemporaries such\nas Boole and Robertson were very critical towards Jevons's use\nof mathematical symbols in logic.\n\n\nIndirect inference or indirect deduction consists of pointing out\n\u201cwhat a thing is, by showing that it cannot be anything\nelse\u201d. According to Jevons this is an important method, since\n\u201cnearly half our logical conclusions rest upon its\nemployment\u201d. The simplest form of indirect inference starts from\nA = AB. The law of duality implies that b =\nAb \u00b7|\u00b7 ab, or by substitution b =\nABb \u00b7|\u00b7 ab.  Since ABb = 0\n(a contradiction), it follows that b = ab. Hence, if\na metal is an element, it follows that a non-element is a\nnon-metal. Jevons refers to this conclusion as the\n\u201ccontrapositive proposition\u201d of the original. The\ncontrapositive of a simple identity A = B is\na = ab, and since A = B implies\nB = A it also follows that b =\nab. The two contrapositives taken together let us conclude\nthat a = b. The method of indirect inference can be\nused to describe a class of objects or a term, given certain\nconditions. The class is first of all \u2018developed\u2019 using\nthe law of duality, then alternative expressions taken from the\npremises are substituted, and finally all contradictory alternatives\nare scrapped. The remaining terms may be equated to the term in\nquestion.\n\n Jevons introduces the logical alphabet \u2013 a series of combinations\nthat can be formed with a given set of terms. For instance,\nA and B produce the four combinations AB,\nAb, aB and ab. Using the logical\nalphabet, logic becomes simply an exercise of fully developing all\nterms and eliminating the contradictory terms. However, when the\namount of letters increases, the amount of possible combinations\nbecomes considerable. Jevons considers some techniques and\ndevices to facilitate these endeavours, such as a \u2018Logical\nslate\u2019 (the logical alphabet engraved upon a school writing\nslate). Nevertheless, when more than six terms are involved, it\nbecomes almost impossible to solve the problem. To facilitate\nthis kind of reasoning Jevons developed a logical abacus, which\noperates on simple mechanical principles. It can be seen as one\nof the first computers.\n\n Induction is the inverse process of deduction, but it is a much more\ncomplicated mode of reasoning. Induction proceeds according to\ncertain rules of thumb, trial and error, and past attempts. \nInduction of simple identities becomes very complex as soon as more\nthan just a few terms are involved. Induction of partial\nidentities starts from a certain premise in disjunctive form A\n= B \u00b7|\u00b7 C \u00b7|\u00b7 D\n\u00b7|\u00b7 \u2026 \u00b7|\u00b7 P\n\u00b7|\u00b7 Q, and then we need propositions that\nascribe a certain property to all individuals: B =\nBX, C = CX, \u2026, Q =\nQX. Substituting and rearranging yield the desired\nresult A = AX. According to Jevons this is the\nmost important scientific procedure, as \u201ca great mass of\nscientific truths consists of propositions of this form A =\nAB\u201d. Jevons recognises the problem of induction \u2014\nthat we can never be sure to predict the future based on past\nknowledge. Jevons needs to bring in principles of number and\ntheory of probability to deal with this matter.\n",
