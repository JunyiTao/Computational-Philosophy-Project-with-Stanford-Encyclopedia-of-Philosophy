    "main_text": "Brouwer\u2019s Views on Logic in 1907 and 1908 || Weak Counterexamples (\u201cunreliability\u201d) and Excluded Middle\n2.4 Weak Counterexamples (\u201cunreliability\u201d) and Excluded Middle\n\nAs the rules of logic operate on linguistic objects, and these\nlinguistic objects may be considered separately from the precise\nmathematical context in which they described a truth, it is possible\nto apply the rules of logic and obtain new linguistic objects without\nproviding a precise mathematical context for the latter. In other\nwords, the logical principles, which can be stated without specifying\nthe context in which they are applied, and thereby suggest\ncontext-independence, are for their correctness sensitive to the\ncontext. There is no general guarantee that logical principles which\nare valid in one context, will be equally valid in a different one.\nThis is what Brouwer means when he speaks of \u201cthe unreliability\nof the logical principles\u201d, the title and theme of his seminal\npaper Brouwer 1908C; see also Brouwer 1949A: 1243.\n\nIn the 1908 paper, Brouwer draws a consequence of his general view on\nlogic that he had overlooked in his dissertation: PEM, \\(A \\vee \\neg\nA\\), is not valid. Its constructive validity would mean that we have a\nmethod that, for any \\(A\\), either gives us a\nconstruction for \\(A\\), or shows that such a\nconstruction is impossible. But we do not have such a general decision\nmethod, and there are many open problems in mathematics. Brouwer\nstates \u201cEvery number is finite or infinite\u201d as an example\nof a general proposition for which so far no constructive proof has\nbeen found. As a consequence, he says, it is at present uncertain\nwhether problems such as the following are solvable:\n\n\nIs there in the decimal expansion of \\(\\pi\\) a digit which occurs more\noften than any other one?\n\nDo there occur in the decimal expansion of \\(\\pi\\) infinitely many\npairs of equal consecutive digits? (Brouwer 1908C: 7 [van Atten &\nSundholm 2017: 44])\n\n\nIn effect, Brouwer is saying that we can assert the weak negations of\nthe propositions expressed in these questions; hence, these\npropositions are so-called \u201cBrouwerian counterexamples\u201d or\n\u201cweak counterexamples\u201d to PEM. On the constructive reading\nof PEM, of course any as yet unsolved problem is a weak counterexample\nto PEM. Brouwer began to publish weak counterexamples to PEM in\ninternational journals only much later (1921A, 1924N, 1925E).\n\nBrouwer remarks in the 1908 paper that the fact that PEM is not valid\ndoes not mean that it is false: \\(\\neg(A \\vee \\neg A)\\) implies \\(\\neg\nA \\wedge \\neg \\neg A\\), a contradiction. In other words, \\(\\neg \\neg(A\n\\vee \\neg A)\\) is correct. Brouwer concludes that it is always\nconsistent to use PEM but that it does not always lead to truths. In\nthe latter case, the argument that appeals to PEM establishes not the\ntruth, but the consistency of its conclusion. Brouwer proposes to\ndivide the theorems that are usually considered as proved into the\ntrue and the non-contradictory ones (Brouwer 1908C: 7n.2 [van Atten\n& Sundholm 2017: 44n.14]). That is not a suggestion that there are\nthree truth values, true, non-contradictory, false; for a\nnon-contradictory proposition might be proved one day and thereby\nbecome true.\n\nA mathematical context in which PEM is valid, Brouwer points out, is\nthat of the question whether a given construction of finite character\nis possible in a given finite domain. In such a context there are only\nfinitely many possible attempts at that construction, and each will\nsucceed or fail in finitely many steps (for clarity, the phrasing here\nis not that of Brouwer 1908C but that of Brouwer 1955). So on these\ngrounds \\(A \\vee \\neg A\\) holds, where \\(A\\) is the\nproposition stating that the construction exists.\n\nBrouwer ascribed the belief in the general validity of PEM to an\nunwarranted projection from such finite cases (in particular, those\narising from the application of finite mathematics to everyday\nphenomena) to the\n infinite.[6]\n\nIn his dissertation of 1907, Brouwer still accepted PEM as a\ntautology, (mis)understanding \\(A \\vee \\neg A\\) as \\(\\neg A\n\\rightarrow \\neg A\\) (Brouwer 1907: 131, 160 [1975: 75,\n 88]).[7]\n Curiously, he did realize at the same time that there is no evidence\nfor the principle that every mathematical proposition is either\nprovable or refutable (Brouwer 1907: 142n.3 [1975: 101]); this\nprinciple is the constructively correct reading of PEM. In the paper\nfrom 1908, he corrected his earlier understanding of PEM:\n\n\nNow the principium tertii exclusi: this demands that every supposition\nis either correct or incorrect, mathematically: that of every supposed\nfitting in a certain way of systems in one another, either the\ntermination or the blockage by impossibility, can be constructed.\n(Brouwer 1908C: 5 [van Atten & Sundholm 2017: 42])\n\n",
