    "main_text": "Definition and Subject Matter of Logic\n2. Definition and Subject Matter of Logic\n\nA standard feature of late ancient Greek commentaries on Aristotle\u2019s individual works\nis to begin with prolegomena dealing with the purpose and\nbenefit of a certain discipline, determining its subject matter and\nrank within the system. Similar issues influence Avicenna\u2019s\napproach to the question of the nature of logic and what it aims to\naccomplish as a discipline.\n\nLogic is a theoretical discipline that provides the tools and methods\nrequired to avoid error in reasoning, where reasoning means acquiring\nnew knowledge (conceptual or propositional) of what is unknown (ma\u011fh\u016bl)\nstarting from what is known (ma\u02bfl\u016bm), and to attain the optimal epistemic\nstates legitimately associated with various domains of human\ncognition, most notably certainty (yaq\u012bn) in scientific\ndiscourse (\u02bfilm) and persuasion\n(iqn\u0101\u02bf) in dialectic and rhetorical contexts.\n\nAccordingly, logic has a twofold nature: it is at the same time (i) a\nnormative (literally \u201ccanonical\u201d) instrument, according to\nthe definition in Pointers and Reminders, with respect to any other\ndiscipline, and (ii) a part of philosophy, i.e., an Aristotelian\nscience with its own internal structure, which presupposes a\nwell-defined subject.\n\nIf the purpose and benefit of logic is to lead from what is known to what is unknown, for example from premises to conclusion\nin a valid argument whose premises are asserted, Avicenna\u2019s\naccount of the subject (maw\u1e0d\u016b\u02bf) of logic is\ninextricably tied with a fundamental distinction in Arabic logic,\nwhich can be traced back at least to al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b, between\nthe two main ways in which knowledge is available to the human mind:\nconception (ta\u1e63awwur) and assertion\n(ta\u1e63d\u012bq).\n\nThe distinction between conception and assertion marks the boundary\nbetween the acquisition or possession of individual concepts or\nnotions, and the ascription of truth to statements or judgments. It\nprovides the foundations of Avicenna\u2019s logic (as well as those\nof his epistemology) and determines two distinct modes of knowledge\nlinked on the one hand with (i) concept formation and the domain of\ndefinition (\u1e25add) and description (rasm), and\non the other with (ii) truth and reasoning (demonstrative and\nnon-demonstrative syllogism (qiy\u0101s), depending on the\nepistemic strength of the assertions involved).\n\nThe ultimate building-blocks of definitions (directly) and of syllogisms\n(indirectly) are intelligible notions (ma\u02bf\u0101nin\nma\u02bfq\u016bla). Logic deals with a special kind of\nintelligible notions, which in the Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t are\ncharacterized as second-order intelligible notions\n(ma\u02bfqul\u0101t \u1e6f\u0101niya)\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t I.2, 10\u201311). Assuming that\nfirst-order notions are things like \u201chuman\u201d,\n\u201crational\u201d, \u201cwhiteness\u201d, or \u201cstone\u201d,\nsecond-order (or more generally, higher-order) notions are either\ngenuinely distinct concepts such as \u201csubject\u201d,\n\u201cpredicate\u201d, \u201cgenus\u201d,\n\u201cproposition\u201d, and \u201csyllogism\u201d or, on a weaker\nreading, ways to ascribe second-order properties (such as being a\nuniversal or being a genus and so on) to first-order notions. Logic\ninvestigates the salient properties that hold of second-order notions,\nsuch as the properties of being a genus, the characteristics of\npropositions and their terms, the types of predication\n(essential and accidental), the truth-conditions of propositions, the\nconditions under which arguments are valid and those under which\narguments that seem to be valid are not. On the identification of\nsecondary intelligibles and the subject matter of logic, see (Street 2013) and (Sabra 1980).\n\nFurthermore, logic entertains two levels of analysis, addressing\ndistinct sets of considerations that are commonly referred to as\nformal and material. Formal characteristics are the quantity and\nquality of a proposition or the arrangement of terms in an argument,\nand in general everything that is necessary and sufficient to proceed\nwithout error in reasoning.\n\nMaterial aspects of logic involve considerations relative to the types of terms\nused in propositions and arguments and the relations holding among the\nterms. Thus, for instance, the question whether an argument is\ndemonstrative or not is typically a question that concerns not only\nits form (a demonstrative argument must be valid and consist of well-formed\npropositions), but also its matter, namely\nwhether its terms adequately express the right kinds of necessary and\nexplanatory relations.\n\nThe question what the subject matter of logic is became pressing in later\nArabic logic, as Avicenna\u2019s explicit remarks in the\nIl\u0101hiyy\u0101t were taken to identify too narrow a\nsubject, and conceptions and assertions gained traction as a\nplausible, more general alternative to second-order notions\n(El-Rouayheb 2012).\n\nOn the relation between logic as an instrument and logic as a science,\nsee Qiy\u0101s I.2, Mad\u1e2bal I.3 and for a\ngeneral discussion (Sabra 1980).\n",
