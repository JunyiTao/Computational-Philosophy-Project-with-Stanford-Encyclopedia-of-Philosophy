In this section, we turn to what are at least apparently\ndiachronic norms, that is, those that govern the relationship between\nyour credences at different times. The most well-known such norm is\nConditionalization, or Bayes\u2019 Rule, which roughly tells you how\nyou should update your credences upon receiving some new evidence,\nwhen that new evidence comes in the form of a proposition learned with\ncertainty.\n\n\nDiachronic Conditionalization Suppose \\(C\\) is your\ncredence function at an earlier time \\(t\\) and \\(C'\\) is your credence\nfunction at a later time \\(t'\\) and suppose that, between \\(t\\) and\n\\(t'\\) the strongest proposition you learn is \\(E\\), then rationality\nrequires that, if \\(C(E) \\gt 0\\), then for all \\(X\\) in\n\\(\\mathcal{F}\\), \n\\[\nC'(X) = C(X \\mid E) = \\frac{C(X\\ \\& \\ E)}{C(E)}\n\\]\n That is, at the later time, your\nunconditional credence in a proposition should be equal to your\nearlier credence in it conditional on the strongest proposition you\nlearned in the interim. If it is, we say that your posterior is\nobtained from your prior by conditioning on your new evidence. \n\n\nIn fact, however, the original epistemic utility arguments in this\narea did not attempt to establish Diachronic Conditionalization\ndirectly. Rather, they attempted to establish that, when you know at\nthe earlier time that the evidence you\u2019ll receive will come from\na particular partition, then you should plan to update as Diachronic\nConditionalization demands. There are in fact two versions of the\nresulting norm, depending on the scope of the rationality operator\n(Greaves & Wallace 2006; Briggs & Pettigrew 2020).\n\n\nPartitional Plan Conditionalization (narrow scope)\nIf\n\n\\(C\\) is your credence function at an earlier time \\(t\\),\nthe propositions \\(E_1, \\ldots, E_n\\) form a partition,\nbetween \\(t\\) and \\(t'\\), you\u2019ll learn which \\(E_i\\) is\ntrue, and nothing more,\nyou plan to update as follows: if you learn \\(E_i\\), then\nyou\u2019ll adopt \\(R_{E_i}\\) as your credence function at\n\\(t'\\),\n\n\nthen rationality requires that, if \\(C(E_i) \\gt 0\\), then for all\n\\(X\\) in \\(\\mathcal{F}\\), \n\\[\n R_{E_i}(X) = C(X \\mid E_i) = \\frac{C(X\\ \\& \\ E_i)}{C(E_i)}\n\\]\n\n\n\nThis says that, if \\(C\\) is your prior, rationality requires you to\nplan to update upon receipt of new evidence by conditioning \\(C\\) on\nthat evidence.\n\n\nPartitional Plan Conditionalization (wide scope)\nRationality requires that: if\n\n\\(C\\) is your credence function at an earlier time \\(t\\),\nthe propositions \\(E_1, \\ldots, E_n\\) form a partition,\nbetween \\(t\\) and \\(t'\\), you\u2019ll learn which \\(E_i\\) is\ntrue, and nothing more,\n you plan to update as follows: if you learn \\(E_i\\), then\nyou\u2019ll adopt \\(R_{E_i}\\) as your credence function at\n\\(t'\\),\n\n\nthen, if \\(C(E_i) \\gt 0\\), then for all \\(X\\) in \\(\\mathcal{F}\\),\n\n\\[\n R_{E_i}(X) = C(X \\mid E_i) = \\frac{C(X\\ \\& \\ E_i)}{C(E_i)}\n\\]\n\n\n\nThis says that rationality requires you not to have prior \\(C\\) and\nyet plan to update upon receipt of new evidence in some way other than\nby conditioning \\(C\\) on that new evidence.\n5.4.1 Epistemic utility arguments for Partitional Plan Conditionalization\n\nWe begin with arguments for Partitional Plan Conditionalization.\n\nThe first is due to Hilary Greaves and David Wallace (2008), building\non techniques from Peter M. Brown (1976) and Graham Oddie (1997). Some\nterminology:\n\n An updating plan is a function from states of the world\nto credence functions.\n An updating plan is available if it takes the same\nvalues at any two worlds at which your evidence will be the same.\n An updating plan is a conditionalizing plan for a prior\ncredence function if, whenever you give positive credence to the\nevidence you\u2019ll learn at a world, the plan tells you to update\nat that world by conditioning the prior on that evidence.\n\n\n\nExpectation Theorem for Partitional Plan Conditionalization\n(narrow scope) (Greaves & Wallace 2008) Suppose your\nepistemic utility function is strictly proper, and suppose your\nevidence will tell you which member of a particular partition is true.\nThen the updating plans that maximize expected epistemic utility from\nthe point of view of your prior credence function among those\navailable are exactly the conditionalizing plans for that prior.\n\n\nI sketch the proof in the\n supplementary materials.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n\nStrict Propriety\n\n\nMaximize Expected Utility\n\nTherefore,\n\nPartitional Plan Conditionalization (narrow scope)\n\n\n\nBy asking about local updating plans, which say not which credence\nfunction you plan to adopt upon receiving new evidence, but just what\ncredence you plan to assign to a particular proposition, Kenny\nEaswaran (2013) extends this argument to establish a version of van\nFraassen\u2019s (1999) Reflection Principle and a norm known as\nConglomerability, which says that your unconditional credence in a\nproposition should lie in the range spanned by your conditional\ncredences in it given different elements of a partition.\n\nMaximize Expected Utility is a well-known norm of decision theory, but\nit is not universally accepted. Some decision theorists think that it\nis rationally permissible to take risk into account in ways that\nexpected utility theory rules out. Building on a proposal by John\nQuiggin (1982), Lara Buchak (2013) has provided a popular alternative\nnorm, Maximize Risk-Weighted Expected Utility, which allows you to\ntake risk into account. Catrin Campbell-Moore and Bernhard Salow\n(2022) have explored an analogue of Greaves and Wallace\u2019s\nargument that replaces Strict Propriety with its appropriately\nrisk-sensitive analogue and replaces Maximize Expected Utility with\nBuchak\u2019s risk-sensitive version. They show that these do not\nentail Partitional Plan Conditionalization, but rather an alternative\nupdating norm.\n\nThe second argument for Partitional Plan Conditionalization is due to\nRay Briggs and Richard Pettigrew (2020), with an improvement by\nMichael Nielsen (2021). They show that, assuming Additivity +\nContinuity + Strict Propriety, if you look not only at the epistemic\nutility of your updating plan, but at the sum of the epistemic utility\nof your prior and the epistemic utility of your updating plan, then if\nyou violate Partitional Plan Conditionalization (wide scope), there is\nan alternative prior and updating plan you might have had instead that\ndominates yours.\n\n\nDominance Theorem for Partitional Plan Conditionalization\n(wide scope) (Briggs & Pettigrew 2020; Nielsen 2021)\nSuppose your epistemic utility function is additive, continuous, and\nstrictly proper measure. Then:\n\n If your updating plan is available but it is not a\nconditionalizing plan for your prior, then there is an alternative\nprior and alternative available updating plan such that, at every\nstate of the world, the sum of the epistemic utility of your prior and\nthe epistemic utility of your updating plan is less than the sum of\nthe epistemic utility of the alternative prior and the epistemic\nutility of the alternative updating plan.\n If your updating plan is a conditionalizing plan for your prior,\nthen there is no alternative prior and alternative updating plan such\nthat, at every state of the world, the sum of the epistemic utility of\nyour prior and the epistemic utility of your updating plan is less\nthan the sum of the epistemic utility of the alternative prior and the\nepistemic utility of the alternative updating plan.\n\n\n\nI sketch the proof in the\n supplementary materials.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n\nAdditivity\n +\n Continuity\n +\n Strict Propriety\n (for epistemic utility functions)\n\nUndominated Dominance\n\n\nTherefore,\n\nPartitional Plan Conditionalization (wide scope)\n\n5.4.2 Epistemic utility arguments for Diachronic Conditionalization\n\nWe turn now to two arguments for\n Diachronic Conditionalization.\n Both take the same approach. You begin with your prior credence\nfunction at the earlier time. Between the earlier and later time you\nlearn a proposition with certainty. Then, at the later time, you use\nyour prior credence function to decide what your new posterior\ncredence function should be. They differ in how they think that\ndecision should be made.\n\nAccording to Hannes Leitgeb and Richard Pettigrew (2010), you should\npick the posterior credence function that maximizes expected epistemic\nutility from the point of view of your prior credence function, but\nwhere the expectation is taken over only those worlds at which the\nevidence is true. If your epistemic utility function is strictly\nproper, and if your prior assigns positive credence to the proposition\nyou learn, then the unique posterior credence function that maximizes\nthis is the one demanded by\n Diachronic Conditionalization.\n\nCampbell-Moore and Salow (2022) also consider an analogue of this\nargument in the case of Buchak\u2019s risk-sensitive decision theory\nand they show that, in this case, it does establish\n Diachronic Conditionalization.\n\nAccording to Dmitri Gallow (2019), on the other hand, you should\nmaximize epistemic utility in the usual way, where the expectation is\ntaken over all worlds, but you should change the epistemic utility\nfunction you use, so that it assigns the same neutral value to every\ncredence function at every world at which the evidence you\u2019ve\nlearned is false. Again it turns out that, if the epistemic utility\nfunction you begin with is strictly proper, and if your prior assigns\npositive credence to the proposition you learn, the credence function\nthat maximizes this is the one demanded by\n Diachronic Conditionalization.\n5.4.3 Other updating situations\n\nThe updating norms we have considered so far and the arguments in\ntheir favor make a number of assumptions. First, they assume that your\nevidence will come in the form of a proposition learned with\ncertainty\u2014we might call this assumption Certainty.\nSecond, they assume that proposition will be true\u2014we might call\nthis assumption Factivity. Third, they assume that\nproposition will come from a partition that can be specified in\nadvance\u2014we might call this Partitionality. We'll treat\nthese three in turn.\n\nFirst, Certainty. Richard Jeffrey (1965) points out that our evidence\noften doesn\u2019t come in the form of a proposition learned with\ncertainty, because there is often no proposition in our agenda that\nperfectly captures what we learn. In such cases, he suggests, the\nevidence places specific constraints on our posterior credences. He\nconsiders the case in which it specifies which posterior credences you\nmust have in the propositions in a particular partition, and he\nformulated a rule, known as Probability Kinematics or Jeffrey\nConditionalization, which tells you how to set your posterior\ncredences in other propositions that lie outside that partition.\nInspired by a suggestion by Diaconis and Zabell (1982), Leitgeb and\nPettigrew (2010) argue that, when your evidence places constraints on\nyour posterior credence function, you should update by adopting\nwhichever credence function maximizes expected epistemic utility from\nthe point of view of your prior credence function among those\ncredence functions that satisfy the constraint. Leitgeb and\nPettigrew show that the\n Brier score\n gives a different updating rule from the one that Jeffrey proposed.\nLevinstein (2012) argues that this is a reason to reject the Brier\nscore, and Pettigrew (Theorem 12, Section 8.5, 2021) shows that no\nadditive strictly proper scoring rule gives Jeffrey\u2019s rule via\nthis approach.\n\nJason Konek (2022) offers an alternative approach to the situations\nthat Jeffrey identified. He notes that, while there might be no\nproposition in the agenda of your prior credence function that you\ncome to learn with certainty, there is a proposition that expresses\nyour experience, and you become able to entertain it when you have the\nlearning experience, because you can simply point to the learning\nexperience and say \u2018I learned that\u2019. So, after the\nlearning experience, you can add this proposition to your agenda and\nretrospectively set your conditional credences in having that learning\nexperience, given different ways the world might be; and that is\nsufficient to allow you to set your new credences given that you did\nhave that learning experience. He provides an epistemic utility\nargument for a particular way of doing this.\n\nSecond, Factivity. There are two ways to approach this, but the second\nis also the way to approach Partitionality, so we\u2019ll leave that\nfor the moment. The first approach is suggested by Michael Rescorla\n(2022), who asks not what you should plan to do when you learn which\nproposition from a particular partition is true, but what you should\nplan to do when you become certain of a proposition in a partition,\nleaving open whether the proposition of which you\u2019ll become\ncertain will be true. Pettigrew (2023) shows that you should plan to\nupdate by conditioning on what you learned with certainty by giving a\ndominance argument for the following norm, due to Bas van Fraassen\n(1999) (see also (Staffel & de Bona forthcoming)):\n\n\nWeak General Reflection Principle Rationality\nrequires that your prior credence function should be a\n mixture\n of your possible future credence functions. \n Pettigrew proves the following theorem:\n\n\n\nDominance Theorem for Weak General Reflection (Pettigrew\n2023) Suppose your epistemic utility function is additive,\ncontinuous, and strictly proper measure. Then:\n\n If your prior credence function is not a\n mixture\n of your possible posterior credence functions, then there is an\nalternative prior and, for each possible posterior credence function,\nan alternative posterior such that, at every state of the world and\nfor every possible posterior, the sum of the epistemic utility of your\nprior and the epistemic utility of that posterior is less than the sum\nof the epistemic utility of the alternative prior and the epistemic\nutility of the alternative posterior.\n If your prior credence function is a\n mixture\n of your possible posterior credence functions, then there is no\nalternative prior and, for each possible posterior credence function,\nan alternative posterior such that, at every state of the world and\nfor every possible posterior, the sum of the epistemic utility of your\nprior and the epistemic utility of that posterior is less than the sum\nof the epistemic utility of the alternative prior and the epistemic\nutility of the alternative posterior.\n\n\n\nAs van Fraassen (1999) shows, if we assume that (i) for each element\nof a given partition, there is a unique possible posterior that is\ncertain of it, and (ii) for each possible posterior, there is a unique\nelement of the partition of which it is certain, then the Weak General\nReflection Principle entails that each possible posterior is obtained\nfrom your prior by conditioning on the relevant element of the\npartition.\n\nThird, Partitionality. To represent situations in which your evidence\ndoes come in the form of a proposition learned with certainty, but in\nwhich we assume neither that the proposition is true nor that it comes\nfrom a partition that can be specified in advance, we follow Nilanjan\nDas (2023) in defining an evidence function to be a function\nthat takes a state of the world and returns the proposition\nyou\u2019ll learn with certainty at that state of the world. As\nbefore, an updating plan takes a state of the world to the posterior\nyou plan to adopt when you learn the evidence you\u2019ll receive at\nthat state of the world; and, as before, an updating plan is available\nif it gives the same recommendation for any two states of the world at\nwhich you receive the same evidence. Then Miriam Schoenfield (2016)\nshows that you maximize expected epistemic utility not by planning to\nconditionalize on your evidence, but by planning to conditionalize on\nthe fact that you received that evidence. Gallow (2021) worries that\nthe plans Schoenfield considers available are not genuinely available\nto individuals in situations in which their evidence fails to rule out\nthat their evidence is different from how it actually is, and he\nsuggests a framework in which to represent genuinely available plans\nand describes the updating plan that maximizes expected epistemic\nutility in that framework.\n5.4.4 Updating in social situations\n\nSo far, we have only considered an individual\u2019s credences and\ntheir relationship to one another. But we also learn from others who\ninvestigate the world and share the credences they come to have on\nthat basis. So our epistemic situation affects and is affected by the\nepistemic situation of others. Igor Douven and Sylvia Wenmackers\n(2017) have explored a situation like this. They ask whether epistemic\nutility considerations make different demands for updating from those\nthey make in the individual case. They suppose that the members of a\ngroup all begin with the same prior credence function. Each holds a\ncoin and all the coins have the same bias towards landing heads, but\nthey are uncertain what that bias is to begin with. Each individual\ntosses their coin some number of times and updates their own credences\non the basis of what they observe; then they share their evidence with\nsome of the other members of the group; then they repeat this process\na number of times. After each iteration, we measure their epistemic\nutility, and then we look at the expected average epistemic utility\nacross all members and all times in the process. Douven and Wenmackers\ntreat updating on the private evidence from your own coin tosses and\nupdating on public evidence from the credences of others differently.\nThey assume each member updates on the public evidence of\nothers\u2019 credences by taking the average (arithmetic mean) of\ntheir credences and those of the other members. And then they ask\nwhich updating rule for the private evidence will lead to the greatest\nexpected average epistemic utility, and they use computer simulation\nto show that it is not Bayesian conditionalization. Indeed, they show\nthat an updating rule introduced by van Fraassen (Chapter 6, 1989) to\ngive a crude model of inference to the best explanation outperforms\nBayesian conditionalization (though we don\u2019t know whether some\nother rule outperforms that). However as Pettigrew (2021b) points out,\nthis only shows that, when you update on the evidence of your peers by\ntaking averages, rather than by conditionalizing on it, you should\ncompensate for the suboptimality of that choice by doing something\nother than conditionalizing on your private evidence. But of course\nthe results we\u2019ve considered in this section say you\nshouldn\u2019t do that. You should update on the evidence of your\npeers and the evidence of your private coin tosses as you should\nupdate on everything, namely, by conditionalizing. \n5.4.4 The epistemology of inquiry\n\nAs we saw above, when Greaves and Wallace argue for Partitional Plan\nConditionalization (narrow scope), they hold fixed the partition from\nwhich our evidence will come and ask which updating plan maximizes\nexpected epistemic utility. However, we don\u2019t simply receive\nevidence passively. We also go out and seek it, and in those cases we\nhave to pick from which partition we want our evidence to come: Should\nthe scientist perform this experiment or another? Should the detective\ninterview this suspect or that? Adapting an insight due to I. J. Good\n(1967) to the epistemic setting, Wayne Myrvold (2012) and Alejandro\nP\u00e9rez Carballo (2018) show that we can use epistemic utilities\nto tell which evidence we should collect from the epistemic point of\nview.\n\nGiven a partition, we know that an updating plan that maximizes\nexpected epistemic utility is a conditionalizing plan. So let\u2019s\nhold fixed that, for any given partition, we plan to condition on\nwhichever proposition in it we learn with certainty. And now suppose\nthere are two partitions, and we must choose which one to investigate;\nthat is, we must choose from which one our evidence will come, always\nassuming that, whichever we choose, we\u2019ll respond to the\nevidence we receive by conditioning on it. Then we can simply compare\nthe expected epistemic utility of conditioning on whichever element of\nthe first partition we learn and the expected epistemic utility of\nconditioning on whichever element of the second partition we learn,\nand then do whichever is greater. One result is that, if one partition\nis a fine-graining of the other, so that each proposition in the\nlatter is a disjunction of propositions in the former, we should\nalways choose the finer-grained one.\n\nAs well as providing epistemic norms for choosing between the\npartitions we might investigate, epistemic utilities can also give\nnorms for when to investigate at all and when to consider an issue\nsettled for the time being. To obtain these norms, we simply treat the\noption of conducting no further investigations as the case in which we\ninvestigate the trivial partition that consists only of a tautology.\nIf our epistemic utility function is strictly proper, and if you\nassign any probability to investigating a given partition changing\nyour credences, then investigating must have greater expected\nepistemic utility than not investigating, giving a epistemic analogue\nto Good\u2019s value of information theorem (Good 1967; Myrvold\n2012). But of course such investigations are not cost-free, and so the\nquestion will always arise whether the cost is worth it for the\nexpected epistemic gain.\n\nCampbell-Moore and Salow (2020) show that, for risk-sensitive\nindividuals, investigating isn\u2019t always demanded, even when\nit\u2019s free. It has long been known that such individuals are\nsometimes pragmatically required not to investigate; Campbell-Moore\nand Salow show that they are also sometimes epistemically required not\nto.\n\nSo epistemic utilities give epistemic norms that govern our choices\nbetween different inquiries and our choice whether to investigate at\nall, at least when other aspects are equal. But of course, things are\nrarely equal. There are also pragmatic reasons for investigating one\npartition rather than other, and so some reasons for inquiry are\npragmatic: for instance, investigating one partition might have\ngreater expected epistemic utility than investigating another, but it\nmight be more costly, or it might not help as much to inform a\npressing decision we must soon make. But Myrvold\u2019s and\nP\u00e9rez Carballo\u2019s approach does at least tell us the\nepistemic value of an investigation at a state of the world, which can\nthen be weighted against its pragmatic value and perhaps also moral\nvalue to give the all-things-considered verdict on what to do.\nFurthermore, this approach shows that there can be purely epistemic\nreasons for gathering evidence for a particular investigation,\nanswering a question that has been raised in the literature on the\nepistemology of inquiry (e.g. Woodard & Flores forthcoming). And\nFilippo Vindrola and Vincenzo Crupi (forthcoming) have recently\napplied the approach to the Wason Selection Task to vindicate\nWason\u2019s original contention that people tend to choose how to\ninvestigate irrationally in that case.\n",
