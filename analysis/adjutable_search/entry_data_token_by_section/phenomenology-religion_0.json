    "main_text": "The phenomenology of religious experience\n1. The phenomenology of religious experience\n\nCommentators on religious experience disagree on the significance of\nphenomenological considerations. Is there a phenomenology that is\ndistinctive of religious experience? And if there is, do we have a\nreliable vocabulary to describe it? Is there a phenomenology of\nmystical experience which crosses faith boundaries? Or are such\nexperiences saturated with tradition-specific doctrinal assumptions?\nAre reports of religious experiences in central cases best read as\ndoctrine-inspired interpretations of the subjective character of the\nexperience, rather than as accounts of their phenomenology? And does\nthe affective phenomenology of religious experience do any epistemic\nwork? Let\u2019s consider some of these issues.\n",
