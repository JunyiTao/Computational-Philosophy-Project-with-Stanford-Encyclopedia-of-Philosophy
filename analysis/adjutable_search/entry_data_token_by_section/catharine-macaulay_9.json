Thoughts on progress, liberty and education\n\nMacaulay believed in the existence of moral truths, which are\n\u201cinterwoven in the nature of contemplative objects\u201d and\nwhich exist independently of God or human will. Like other abstract\ntruths, they can be discovered through the use of reason. She defends\nthis intellectualism in her Treatise on the immutability of moral\ntruth, and also sets out to refute the libertarian account of\nfreedom of the will developed by Dr William King in his Concerning\nthe Origin of Evil, as well as the philosophy set out in\nBolingbroke\u2019s Philosophical Works.\n\nIn The Treatise she also puts forward her objections to all\nthose theories of the source of moral injunctions, which, like\nBolingbroke\u2019s account, attempt to reduce them to rules which are in\nour rational self-interest, arguing that \u201c\u2026 those who\nonly regard virtue as a principle, convenient for general use, will\ndiscard it whenever that general interest comes in opposition to\nself\u201d (Macaulay 1783, 77). Against such views she argues that\nthe genuine rational interest of a rational being is to act in\naccordance with the dictates of reason. Had God intended us simply to\nmaximise our own selfish pleasures in this life, he would have given\nus appropriate instincts, for\n\n\n\u2026 that power of combining and generalizing his ideas, in such a\nmanner as to apprehend truths of the most abstract nature, with the\npower of memory in the large extent in which it is found in human\nexistence, are superfluous and mischievous gifts on the principle of\nhuman mortallity. (Macaulay 1783, 98)\n\n\nBut the fact that we have reason, and can appreciate the abstract\nprinciples of right, implies that our true self-interest is to act in\naccordance with the principles of reason, which are the principles of\nmoral obligation.\n\n\nIndependent of those pleasurable sensations which attend the refined\naffections, and the elevated sentiments and passions, there is a\nprinciple of rational agency, which corresponds with the precise\nadmeasurement of every action, with a rule of right; although the\nconduct it directs, militates against natural inclination, against the\ninterest of natural affection, and where every pleasurable sensation\nis sacrificed to the conviction of judgement, and to the rigid\ndictates of a well informed understanding. (Macaulay 1783, 129)\n\n\nShe concludes that, by considering what a rational moral being would\ndesire, \u201cwe gain an idea of rational interest which must ever\nattend on rational nature \u2026\u201d (Macaulay 1783, 130).\n\nRather than solving the problem of evil by allowing that there are\nuncaused choices, Macaulay attempts two alternative solutions. One\ninvolves the thought, which she also attributes to Addison, that since\nwe cannot be assured that virtue is rewarded in this world, we should\ndeduce the existence of a future state of happiness in which the\napparent injustices in this world are made good (Macaulay 1783,\n94\u20136). The other rests on her understanding of the circumstances\nnecessary for the perfectibility of humanity. Man, she claims\n\n\n\u2026 is placed on this terrestrial globe, as in a nursery, or soil\naptly fitted to give strength and vigour, and a more advanced maturity\nto his young and infirm reason; that he is placed on this terrestrial\nglobe as in a school adapted to the advantages of a practical\nexperience; and that he is surrounded with difficulties and hostile\npowers, for the purpose of enlarging his experience, and inducing a\nstate of trial of that virtue which his reason and his experience\nenables him to acquire. (Macaulay 1783, 234)\n\n\nHowever, she is forced ultimately to admit that neither of these\ndoctrines entirely relieves God of the responsibility for evil, and\nconsoles herself with the observation that the believers in arbitrary\nfree will are in no better position than those who accept the doctrine\nof the will which she calls, \u201cmoral necessity\u201d (Macaulay\n1783, 232).\n",
