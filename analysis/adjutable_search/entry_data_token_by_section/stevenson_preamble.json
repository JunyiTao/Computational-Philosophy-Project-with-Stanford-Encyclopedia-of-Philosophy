    "main_text": "\n\nCharles Leslie Stevenson (1908\u20131979) was an American philosopher\nbest known for his pioneering work in the field of metaethics\n(roughly: the study of the meaning and nature of moral language,\nthought, knowledge, and reality) and, specifically, as a central\nfigure along with C. K. Ogden and I. A. Richards (1923) and A. J. Ayer\n(1936) in the development of emotivism. Emotivism, a precursor to the\nmetaethical expressivism today championed by Simon Blackburn (1993,\n1998), Alan Gibbard (1990, 2003), and Michael Ridge (2014), among\nothers, is typically understood as a theory of moral language\naccording to which ethical sentences may be usefully compared to\nexclamative and imperative sentences (\u2018Hooray!\u2019, \u2018Be\nkind\u2019) in that they are used to express a speaker\u2019s affective or\nnoncognitive psychological states (such as approval or disapproval).\nThis contrasts with views according to which the primary use of such\nsentences would be to describe some action, person,\ninstitution, etc. Stevenson\u2019s emotivism, however, was more than a\ntheory of moral language, his account of moral language was but one\npart of a metaethical theory, grounded in moral and linguistic\npsychology. It was intended to clarify the nature and structure of\na whole range of normative problems common to everyday\nlife\u2014ethical, aesthetic, political, etc.\u2014as well as the\nmethods typically used to resolve them.\n",
