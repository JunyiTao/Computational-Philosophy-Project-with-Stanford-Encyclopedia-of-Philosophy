    "main_text": "Arguments for Open Borders || Democracy\n2.3 Democracy\n\n\nAs was explained above, Phillip Cole has offered reasons to question\nthe view that democratic governance depends upon there being closed\nborders. More recently, though, Arash Abizadeh (2008) has\nextended this reasoning to argue that democratic principles are\nactually incompatible with a state\u2019s right to unilaterally\nexclude outsiders. As he puts it, \u201canyone who accepts a\ngenuinely democratic theory of political legitimation domestically is\nthereby committed to rejecting the unilateral domestic right to control\nand close the state\u2019s boundaries\u2026\u201d (Abizadeh 2008:\n38) His argument involves two core premises, one moral and the\nsecond descriptive. The moral premise is his construal of the\ndemocratic justification thesis, which stipulates that a state\u2019s\ncoercive presence is illegitimate unless it is democratically justified\nto everyone coerced. The second premise is merely the descriptive\nobservation that a state coerces foreigners when it forcibly prevents\nunwelcome immigrants from entering the state\u2019s territory.\nIn light of these two points, Abizadeh concludes that a state may not\nunilaterally exclude outsiders; it can permissibly adopt an exclusive\nimmigration policy only if it democratically justifies this practice to\noutsiders. In other words, it would be impermissible for a state\nto forcibly restrict outsiders without first giving these outsiders a\nvote in the referendum which decided whether or not to adopt this\nrestrictive immigration policy.\n\n\nCorresponding to the two central premises, there are two ways to\ncontest this line of reasoning. First and most obviously, one\nmight follow David Miller\u2019s lead and deny that forcibly\nrestricting immigration actually coerces outsiders in the morally\nrelevant sense (Miller 2010). Even if one concedes that\npotential immigrants are coerced, though, one might doubt that coercion\ncannot be permissible in the absence of democratic justification.\nTo appreciate the appeal of this second strategy, imagine that two\ncriminals want to enter my house and help themselves to my copy of\nMichael Walzer\u2019s Spheres of Justice. It seems\ncrazy to think that I may not take proportionate steps to coercively\nrepel them without first putting my planned resistance up to a vote\namong the three of us. And if I do not need to democratically\njustify my coercively protecting my right to keep strangers out of my\nhouse, why think that a state must democratically justify its attempts\nto keep uninvited foreigners out of its political community? Of\ncourse, a defender of this type of democratic case for open borders\nmight counter that, unlike a legitimate owner of private property, the\nconstituents of a state have no dominion over the state\u2019s\nterritory, but this response would be available only if it could be\nshown that a state\u2019s constituents lack the relevant moral\nstanding over the political territory in question.\n",
