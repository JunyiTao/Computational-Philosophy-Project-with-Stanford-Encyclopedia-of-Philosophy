    "main_text": "Applications of the Logistic Method || The Paradox of Analysis\n3.4 The Paradox of Analysis\n\nChurch\u2019s brief remarks on the paradox of analysis focus\nexclusively on the sentence\n\n(1)\nA brother is a male sibling.\n\n\n(While this is an example of a trivial analysis, its triviality does\nnot affect the cogency of Church\u2019s discussion.) Church renders\n(1) as\n\n(2)\n\\(b = \\textit{ms}\\)\n\n\nwhich he thinks of as an expression \u201cof the Boolean algebra of\nclasses\u2014or better, of class concepts\u201d (1946a [BE: 956]).\nAccording to this proposal, the concept of a brother is a kind of\n\u201cproduct\u201d of the concepts of a male and a sibling. (Of\ncourse, this ignores the relational nature of both sides of the\nequation. For example, the only siblings relevant to the definition\nare the brother\u2019s siblings; other siblings are ignored, and so\nthe analysis is incomplete. But we shall nonetheless stick to\nChurch\u2019s formulation.) The problem as Church sees it is\nthis:\n\n\nIf \\(b\\) and \\(\\textit{ms}\\) are the same concept, then it must be\npossible to introduce either in place of the other without alteration\nof meaning\u2014indeed this is clearly the intention, or part of the\nintention, of any analysis in the sense of Moore. Hence in particular\nthe analysis \\(b = \\textit{ms}\\) must not be different from \\(b = b\\)\nor \\(\\textit{ms} = \\textit{ms}\\). This would seem to reduce analysis\nto something trivial and uninformative. But it is evident\notherwise\u2014especially from cases in which, though a concept is in\nsome sense known, its analysis presents difficulty\u2014that analysis\nis not always trivial. (1946a [BE: 956])\n\n\nChurch argues that the paradox is a special case of what is now known\nas \u201cFrege\u2019s Puzzle\u201d. It is unclear how a statement\nof the form \\(a = b\\) can be both true and informative; for if it is\ntrue, then it would seem to say the same thing as \\(a = a\\), since\nthis is the result of substituting \\(a\\) for \\(b\\) in \\(a = b\\).\nMoreover, Church views (2) as a special case of an informative\nidentity statement, with the difference that (2)\u2014unlike a\nstatement of the form \\(a = a\\) that asserts the identity of\nobjects\u2014asserts the identity of concepts or senses. That is,\nChurch takes \u201cbrother\u201d and \u201cmale sibling\u201d to\ndesignate concepts in the context of (2), rather than classes, since\n(2) is meant to be an analysis. Further, while \u201cbrother\u201d\nand \u201cmale sibling\u201d designate the same concept, viz.\nbrother or male sibling, they may nevertheless\ndiffer in sense (that is, though they designate the same concept the\nexpress, they express different concepts as senses); and this\nis what explains how (2) can be informative and how the proposition\nexpressed by (2) can differ from that expressed by the trivial \\(b =\nb\\) or \\(\\textit{ms} = \\textit{ms}\\).\n\nThe power of Church\u2019s proposal may not yet be apparent due to\nthe triviality of the sample analysis. Recall Church\u2019s remark\nthat there are cases of analyses (or hoped for analyses) where\n\n\nthough a concept is in some sense known, its analysis presents\ndifficulty\u2014that analysis is not always trivial. (1946a [BE:\n956])\n\n\nIn philosophy the correct analysis of the concept of knowledge has\nproved to be profoundly elusive. In mathematics, the analysis of the\nconcept of the limit of a function was a triumph, as was the analysis\nof the concept of an effectively calculable (computable) function.\nChurch would view these as cases where analysans and\nanalysandum designate the same concept but express radically\ndifferent senses; and this does seem exactly right. Some, however,\nhave thought that Church\u2019s way of dealing with the paradox of\nanalysis and his way of dealing with Mates\u2019 problem are\nincompatible. This is discussed in\n supplement C.2.\n",
