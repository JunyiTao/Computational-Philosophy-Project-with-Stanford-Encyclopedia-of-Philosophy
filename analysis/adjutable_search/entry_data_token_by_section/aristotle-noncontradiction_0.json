    "main_text": "Three Versions of the Principle of Non-Contradiction\n1. Three Versions of the Principle of Non-Contradiction\n\nThere are arguably three versions of the principle of\nnon-contradiction to be found in Aristotle: an ontological, a doxastic\nand a semantic version. The first version concerns things that exist\nin the world, the second is about what we can believe, and the third\nrelates to assertion and truth. The first version (hereafter, simply\nPNC) is usually taken to be the main version of the principle and it\nruns as follows: \u201cIt is impossible for the same thing to belong\nand not to belong at the same time to the same thing and in the same\nrespect\u201d (with the appropriate qualifications) (Metaph\nIV 3 1005b19\u201320). The following are some of those\nqualifications: The \u201csame thing\u201d that belongs must be one\nand the same thing and it must be the actual thing and not merely its\nlinguistic expression. For example, it is possible for someone to be a\npitcher and not a pitcher where \u201cpitcher\u201d in the first\ninstance refers to a baseball player and in the second to a jug that\ncan hold beer. Also, while it is possible for x to be\nactually F and potentially not F, it is impossible\nfor something to be actually F and actually not F. A\ntable can be actually red and potentially not red, but not actually\nred and actually not red at the same time.\n\nThe second version is as follows: \u201cIt is impossible to hold\n(suppose) the same thing to be and not to be (Metaph IV 3\n1005b24 cf.1005b29\u201330).\u201d Although this version is\nambiguous as it stands, it is best understood as the claim that it is\nimpossible to hold the same thing to be F and not to be\nF &c.\n\nAs a descriptive account of human psychology, this may seem\nimplausible. People surely have inconsistent beliefs; indeed, most of\nus have many inconsistent beliefs. This is especially true if we take\ninto account the consequences of our beliefs. Must one, though,\nbelieve the consequences of one\u2019s beliefs? These remain\ndifficult issues in modern philosophy of language and epistemology.\nCan one knowingly believe an outright contradiction? Heraclitus, for\ninstance, seems to say contradictory things. Here, Aristotle might\nretort, and he does so retort with respect to Heraclitus, that people\ncan utter such words, but cannot really believe what they are saying\n(Metaph IV 3 1005b23\u201326).\n\nAn alternate way of understanding the second formulation is to treat\nit not as a descriptive claim about human psychology, but as a\nnormative claim, a claim about what it is rational to believe. On this\nview, it is not that one cannot believe that x is F\nand not F &c, but that one cannot rationally do so.\n\nIt is not completely clear how Aristotle understands the second\nformulation. At the end of Metaphysics IV 3, Aristotle gives\na bad argument that the doxastic version rests on the ontological\nversion, confusing belief that not p with not having the\nbelief that p.\n\nThere is a further problem with this second formulation. We need to\ndistinguish the possibility of believing that x is F\nand not F in a particular case from the possibility of\ndisbelieving the first version of PNC in its full generality.\n\nThe third version is that \u201copposite assertions cannot be true at\nthe same time\u201d (Metaph IV 6 1011b13\u201320). As it\nstands, this version is neutral about the internal structure of the\nassertion, but Aristotle assumes that any assertion involves\npredicating one thing of another. As with the second formulation, one\nmight give a psychologistic interpretation, relating to what people\nactually do affirm and deny, but the idea that opposite assertions\ncannot be true at the same time suggests that this third version is\nbetter interpreted as a variant of the first formulation.\n\nHow many versions there are and which version Aristotle intends to\nestablish are matters of controversy. He could be establishing the\nsecond version on the basis of the first, or the first version on the\nbasis of the second, or just the first version or just the second\nversion.\n",
