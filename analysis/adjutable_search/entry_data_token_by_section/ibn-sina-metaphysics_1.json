    "main_text": "Metaphysics Between Ontology and Theology || Ontology and Theology\n2.1 Ontology and Theology\n\nAvicenna\u2019s definition of metaphysics as a science is rooted in a\npremise he elaborates on the basis of Aristotle (Post.\nAnalytics I.10, 76b11\u201322) and al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\n(On the aims of the\n Metaphysics[3]):\n a science must have a subject-matter (upokeimenon:\nmaw\u1e0d\u016b\u02bf) and an object of research\n(zetoumenon: ma\u1e6dl\u016bb;\nmab\u1e25\u016b\u1e6f \u02bfan-hu). The former is assumed\nto be existent (it is a starting-point); the existence of the latter\nhas to be established, which is the purpose\n(\u0121ara\u1e0d) of the science or the aim towards which\nthe science is oriented (maq\u1e63\u016bd). From this\ndistinction a fundamental duality emerges: by virtue of its\nsubject-matter (the existent and its properties), metaphysics is\nconcerned with being and is ontology, whereas from the point of view\nof the question which it must answer, metaphysics establishes\n(i\u1e6fb\u0101t) the existence of the First Principle and\nis\n theology.[4]\n So Avicenna retains the theological conception that al-Kind\u012b\nhighlighted (and Aristotle himself\n suggested);[5]\n at the same time, he develops the line al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\ninitiated by positing being\u2014and not God\u2014as the focus of\nmetaphysics as a universal science (Bertolacci 2006: Ch. 2\u20133;\nMenn 2013). He thus gives his own solution to a traditional question\n(how should Aristotle\u2019s metaphysics be defined?): metaphysics\nfits the definition given in Gamma 1, 1003a20\u201326, as the science\nof being qua being or, literally, of the existent\nqua existent: al-maw\u01e7\u016bd bi-m\u0101 huwa\nmaw\u01e7\u016bd (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 1, 9, 8; 2,\n13, 12\u201313). It is only in terms of the question it must answer\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, I, 1, 5, 13\u20137, 2; 9, 6\u201310;\n3, 19, 5\u20138; 21, 1\u20138; 23, 1\u20139), that the science of\nmetaphysics is \u201cdivine\u201d (al-\u02bfilm\nal-il\u0101h\u012b; cf. Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics\nA.2, 982b28\u2013983a11; E.1, 1026a16\u201321) or \u201cof the\ndivine things\u201d (\u02bfilm al-il\u0101hiyy\u0101t; cf.\nMetaph., 1026a13\u201316), as the title of the metaphysical\nsections of Avicenna\u2019s philosophical summae\nindicate.\n",
