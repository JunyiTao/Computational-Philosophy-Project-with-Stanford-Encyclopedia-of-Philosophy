    "main_text": "\n\n\nTo desire is to be in a particular state of mind. It is a state of\nmind familiar to everyone who has ever wanted to drink water or desired\nto know what has happened to an old friend, but its familiarity does\nnot make it easy to give a theory of desire. Controversy immediately\nbreaks out when asking whether wanting water and desiring knowledge\nare, at bottom, the same state of mind as others that seem somewhat\nsimilar: wishing never to have been born, preferring mangoes to\npeaches, craving gin, having world conquest as one's goal, having\na purpose in sneaking out to the shed, or being inclined to provoke\njust for the sake of provocation. These varied states of mind have all\nbeen grouped together under the heading of \u2018pro attitudes\u2019,\nbut whether the pro attitudes are fundamentally one mental state or\nmany is disputed.\n\n\nIn spite of the disputes, it is nonetheless possible to get a fix on\ndesire itself. Desiring is a state of mind that is commonly associated\nwith a number of different effects: a person with a desire tends to act\nin certain ways, feel in certain ways, and think in certain ways. If\nNora desires tea, for example, then Nora will typically make herself a\ncup of tea; if she does not get herself some tea right away she will\nnonetheless typically feel the urge to do so; she will find the thought\nof tea pleasant and will find her current lack of tea unpleasant; she\nwill find her thoughts repeatedly turning to the idea of tea; she will\njudge that tea seems like a good idea; and so on. These various effects\nhave been the focus of efforts to develop theories that are theories of\ndesire.\n\n\nUnderstanding desires requires at least two things: first, to have a\ntheory of desire itself, and second, to have some familiarity with the\nvarieties of desires that there are. Once acquired, an understanding of\ndesire can illuminate a number of controversies surrounding desire.\n",
