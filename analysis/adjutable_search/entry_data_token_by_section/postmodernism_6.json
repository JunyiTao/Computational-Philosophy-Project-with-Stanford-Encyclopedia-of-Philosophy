    "main_text": "Postmodern Hermeneutics\n7. Postmodern Hermeneutics\n Hermeneutics, the science of textual interpretation, also plays a\nrole in postmodern philosophy.  Unlike deconstruction, which focuses\nupon the functional structures of a text, hermeneutics seeks to arrive\nat an agreement or consensus as to what the text means, or is about.\nGianni Vattimo formulates a postmodern hermeneutics in The End of\nModernity (1985, in English 1988 [1985]), where he distinguishes\nhimself from his Parisian counterparts by posing the question of\npost-modernity as a matter for ontological hermeneutics. Instead of\ncalling for experimentation with counter-strategies and functional\nstructures, he sees the heterogeneity and diversity in our experience\nof the world as a hermeneutical problem to be solved by developing a\nsense continuity between the present and the past. This continuity is\nto be a unity of meaning rather than the repetition of a functional\nstructure, and the meaning is ontological. In this respect, Vattimo's\nproject is an extension of Heidegger's inquiries into the meaning of\nbeing. However, where Heidegger situates Nietzsche within the limits\nof metaphysics, Vattimo joins Heidegger's ontological hermeneutics\nwith Nietzsche's attempt to think beyond nihilism and historicism with\nhis concept of eternal return. The result, says Vattimo, is a certain\ndistortion of Heidegger's reading of Nietzsche, allowing Heidegger and\nNietzsche to be interpreted through one another (Vattimo 1988 [1985],\n176). This is a significant point of difference between Vattimo and\nthe French postmodernists, who read Nietzsche against Heidegger, and\nprefer Nietzsche's textual strategies over Heidegger's pursuit of the\nmeaning of being.\n\nOn Vattimo's account, Nietzsche and Heidegger can be brought together\nunder the common theme of overcoming. Where Nietzsche announces the\novercoming of nihilism through the active nihilism of the eternal\nreturn, Heidegger proposes to overcome metaphysics through a\nnon-metaphysical experience of being. In both cases, he argues, what\nis to be overcome is modernity, characterized by the image that\nphilosophy and science are progressive developments in which thought\nand knowledge increasingly appropriate their own origins and\nfoundations. Overcoming modernity, however, cannot mean progressing\ninto a new historical phase. As Vattimo observes: \u201cBoth\nphilosophers find themselves obliged, on the one hand, to take up a\ncritical distance from Western thought insofar as it is foundational;\non the other hand, however, they find themselves unable to criticize\nWestern thought in the name of another, and truer, foundation\u201d\n(Vattimo 1988 [1985], 2). Overcoming modernity must therefore mean\na Verwindung, in the sense of twisting or distorting\nmodernity itself, rather than an \u00dcberwindung or\nprogression beyond it.\n\nWhile Vattimo takes post-modernity as a new turn in modernity, it\nentails the dissolution of the category of the new in the historical\nsense, which means the end of universal history. \u201cWhile the\nnotion of historicity has become ever more problematic for\ntheory,\u201d he says, \u201cat the same time for historiography\nand its own methodological self-awareness the idea of history as a\nunitary process is rapidly dissolving\u201d (Vattimo 1988 [1985],\n6). This does not mean historical change ceases to occur, but that\nits unitary development is no longer conceivable, so only local\nhistories are possible. The de-historicization of experience has been\naccelerated by technology, especially television, says Vattimo, so\nthat \u201ceverything tends to flatten out at the level of\ncontemporaneity and simultaneity\u201d (Vattimo 1988 [1985], 10). As\na result, we no longer experience a strong sense of teleology in\nworldly events, but, instead, we are confronted with a manifold of\ndifferences and partial teleologies that can only be judged\naesthetically. The truth of postmodern experience is therefore best\nrealized in art and rhetoric.\n\nThe Nietzschean sense of overcoming modernity is \u201cto dissolve\nmodernity through a radicalization of its own innate\ntendencies,\u201d says Vattimo (Vattimo 1988 [1985], 166). These\ninclude the production of \u201cthe new\u201d as a value and the\ndrive for critical overcoming in the sense of appropriating\nfoundations and origins. In this respect, however, Nietzsche shows\nthat modernity results in nihilism: all values, including\n\u201ctruth\u201d and \u201cthe new,\u201d collapse under\ncritical appropriation. The way out of this collapse is the moment of\neternal recurrence, when we affirm the necessity of error in the\nabsence of foundations. Vattimo also finds this new attitude toward\nmodernity in Heidegger's sense of overcoming metaphysics, insofar as\nhe suggests that overcoming the enframing lies with the possibility\nof a turn within the enframing itself. Such a turn would mean\ndeepening and distorting the technological essence, not destroying it\nor leaving it behind. Furthermore, this would be the meaning of\nbeing, understood as the history of interpretation (as\n\u201cweak\u201d being) instead of a grounding truth, and the\nhermeneutics of being would be a distorted historicism. Unlike\ntraditional hermeneutics, Vattimo argues that reconstructing the\ncontinuity of contemporary experience cannot be accomplished without\nunifying art and rhetoric with information from the sciences, and\nthis requires philosophy \u201cto propose a \u2018rhetorically\npersuasive\u2019, unified view of the world, which includes in\nitself traces, residues, or isolated elements of scientific\nknowledge\u201d (Vattimo 1988 [1985], 179). Vattimo's philosophy is\ntherefore the project of a postmodern hermeneutics, in contrast to\nthe Parisian thinkers who do not concern themselves with meaning or\nhistory as continuous unities.\n",
