    "main_text": "\n\nWatsuji Tetsur\u014d (1889\u20131960) was one of a small group of\nphilosophers in Japan during the twentieth century who brought\nJapanese philosophy to the world. He wrote important works on both\nEastern and Western philosophy and philosophers, from ancient Greek,\nto Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Kierkegaard and Heidegger, and from\nprimitive Buddhism and ancient Japanese culture, to D\u014dgen (whose\nnow famous writings Watsuji single-handedly rediscovered), aesthetics,\nand Japanese ethics. His works on Japanese ethics are still regarded\nas the definitive studies.\n\nInfluenced by Heidegger, Watsuji\u2019s Climate and Culture\nis both an appreciation of, and a critique of Heidegger. In\nparticular, Watsuji argues that Heidegger under-emphasizes spatiality,\nand over-emphasizes temporality. Watsuji contends that had Heidegger\nequally emphasized spatiality, it would have tied him more firmly to\nthe human world where we interact, both fruitfully and negatively. We\nare inextricably social, connected in so many ways, and ethics is the\nstudy of these social connections and positive ways of\ninteracting.\n\nHuman beings have a dual-nature, as individuals, and as member of\nvarious social groupings. We face each other in the betweenness\nbetween us, where we can either maintain a safe distance, or enter\ninto intimate relationships of worth. Fundamental to positive,\nintimate relationships is trust, and trustworthiness.\n",
