    "main_text": "Composition Principles || Composition, Existence, and Identity\n5. Indeterminacy and Fuzziness\n\nWe conclude with some remarks on a question that was briefly mentioned\nabove in connection with the Special Composition Question but that\npertains more generally to the underlying notion of parthood that\nmereology seeks to systematize. All the theories examined so far, from\nM to GEM and its variants, appear to\nassume that parthood is a perfectly determinate relation: given any\ntwo entities x and y, there is always an objective,\ndeterminate fact of the matter as to whether or not x is part\nof y. However, in some cases this seems problematic. Perhaps\nthere is no room for indeterminacy in the idealized mereology of space\nand time as such; but when it comes to the mereology of ordinary\nspatio-temporal particulars (for instance) the picture looks\ndifferent. Think of objects such as clouds, forests, heaps of sand.\nWhat exactly are their constitutive parts? What are the mereological\nboundaries of a desert, a river, a mountain? Some stuff is positively\npart of Mount Everest and some stuff is positively not part of it, but\nthere is borderline stuff whose mereological relationship to Everest\nseems indeterminate. Even living organisms may, on closer look, give\nrise to indeterminacy issues. Surely Tibbles's body comprises his tail\nand surely it does not comprise Pluto's. But what about the whisker\nthat is coming loose? It used to be a firm part of Tibbles and soon it\nwill drop off for good, yet meanwhile its mereological relation to the\ncat is dubious. And what goes for material bodies goes for everything.\nWhat are the mereological boundaries of a neighborhood, a college, a\nsocial organization? What about the boundaries of events such as\npromenades, concerts, wars? What about the extensions of such ordinary\nconcepts as baldness, wisdom, personhood? \n\nThese worries are of no little import, and it might be thought that\nsome of the principles discussed above would have to be revisited\naccordingly\u2014not because of their ontological import but because\nof their classical, bivalent presuppositions. For example, the\nextensionality theorem of EM, (27), says that\ncomposite things with the same proper parts are identical, but in the\npresence of indeterminacy this may call for qualifications. The model\nin Figure 9, left, depicts x and y as non-identical\nby virtue of their having distinct determinate parts; yet one might\nprefer to describe a situation of this sort as one in which the\nidentity between x and y is itself indeterminate,\nowing to the partly indeterminate status of the two outer atoms.\nConversely, in the model on the right x and y have\nthe same determinate proper parts, yet again one might prefer to\nsuspend judgment concerning their identity, owing to the indeterminate\nstatus of the middle atom. \n\n\nFigure 9. Objects with indeterminate parts (dashed\nlines).\n\n\nNow, it is clear that a lot here depends on how exactly one\nunderstands the relevant notion of indeterminacy. There are, in fact,\ntwo ways of understanding a claim of the form\n\n\n(64)\nIt is indeterminate whether a is part of\nb, \n\n\ndepending on whether the phrase \u2018it is indeterminate\nwhether\u2019 is assigned wide scope, as in (64a), or narrow scope,\nas in (64b):\n\n\n(64a)\nIt is indeterminate whether b is such that a\nis part of it. \n\n(64b)\nb is such that it is indeterminate whether a\nis part of it. \n\n\nOn the first understanding, the indeterminacy is merely de\ndicto: perhaps \u2018a\u2019 or\n\u2018b\u2019 are vague terms, or perhaps\n\u2018part\u2019 is a vague predicate, but there is no reason to\nsuppose that such vagueness is due to objective deficiencies in the\nunderlying reality. If so, then there is no reason to think that it\nshould affect the apparatus of mereology either, at least insofar as\nthe theory is meant to capture some structural features of the world\nregardless of how we talk about it. For example, the statement\n\n\n(65)\nThe loose whisker is part of Tibbles \n\n\nmay owe its indeterminacy to the semantic indeterminacy of\n\u2018Tibbles\u2019: our linguistic practices do not, on closer\nlook, specify exactly which portion of reality is currently picked out\nby that name. In particular, they do not specify whether the name\npicks out something whose current parts include the whisker that is\ncoming loose and, as a consequence, the truth conditions of (65) are\nnot fully determined. But this is not to say that the stuff out there\nis mereologically indeterminate. Each one of a large variety of\nslightly distinct chunks of reality has an equal claim to being the\nreferent of the vaguely introduced name \u2018Tibbles\u2019, and\neach such thing has a perfectly precise mereological structure: some\nof them currently include the lose whisker among their parts, others\ndo not. (Proponents of this view, which also affords a way of dealing\nwith the so-called \u201cproblem of the many\u201d of Unger 1980 and\nGeach 1980, include Hughes 1986, Heller 1990, Lewis 1993a, McGee 1997,\nand Varzi 2001.) Alternatively, one could hold that the indeterminacy\nof (65) is due, not to the semantic indeterminacy of\n\u2018Tibbles\u2019, but to that of \u2018part\u2019 (as in\nDonnelly 2014): there is no one parthood relation; rather, several\nslightly different relations are equally eligible as extension of the\nparthood predicate, and while some such relations connect the loose\nwisker to Tibbles, others do not. In this sense, the dashed lines in\nFigure 9 would be \u201cdefects\u201d in the models, not in the\nreality that they are meant to represent. Either way, it is apparent\nthat, on a de dicto understanding, mereological indeterminacy\nneed not be due to the way the world is (or isn't): it may just be an\ninstance of a more general and widespread phenomenon of indeterminacy\nthat affects our language and our conceptual apparatus at large. As\nsuch, it can be accounted for in terms of whatever\ntheory\u2014semantic, pragmatic, or even epistemic\u2014one finds\nbest suited for dealing with the phenomenon in its generality. (See\nthe entry on\n vagueness.)\n The principles of mereology, understood as a theory of the parthood\nrelation, or of all the relations that qualify as admissible\ninterpretations of the parthood predicate, would hold\n regardless.[26]\n\nBy contrast, on the second way of understanding claims of the form\n(64), corresponding to (64b), the relevant indeterminacy is genuinely\nde re: there is no objective fact of the matter as to whether\na is part of b, regardless of the words we use to\ndescribe the situation. For example, on this view (65) would be\nindeterminate, not because of the vagueness of \u2018Tibbles\u2019,\nbut because of the vagueness of Tibbles itself: there simply would be\nno fact of the matter as to whether the whisker that is coming loose\nis part of the cat. Similarly, the dashed lines in Figure 9 would not\nreflect a \u201cdefect\u201d in the models but a genuine, objective\ndeficiency in the mereological organization of the underlying reality.\nAs it turns out, this is not a popular view: already Russell (1923)\nargued that the very idea of worldly indeterminacy betrays a\n\u201cfallacy of verbalism\u201d, and some have gone as far as\nsaying that de re indeterminacy is simply not\n\u201cintelligible\u201d (Dummett 1975: 314; Lewis 1986b: 212) or\nruled out a priori (Jackson 2001: 657). Nonetheless, several\nphilosophers feel otherwise and the idea that the world may include\nvague entities relative to which the parthood relation is not fully\ndetermined has received considerable attention in recent literature,\nfrom Johnsen (1989), Tye (1990), and van Inwagen (1990: ch. 17) to\nMorreau (2002), McKinnon (2003), Akiba (2004), N. Smith (2005), Hyde\n(2008: \u00a75.3), Carmichael (2011), and Sattig (2013, 2014),\ninter alia. Even those who do not find that thought\nattractive might wonder whether an a priori ban on it might\nbe unwarranted\u2014a deep-seated metaphysical prejudice, as Burgess\n(1990: 263) puts it. (Dummett himself withdrew his earlier remark and\nspoke of a \u201cprejudice\u201d in his 1981: 440.) It is therefore\nworth asking: How would such a thought impact on the mereological\ntheses considered in the preceding sections? \n\nThere is, unfortunately, no straightforward way of answering this\nquestion. Broadly speaking, two main sorts of answer may be\nconsidered, depending on whether (i) one simply takes the\nindeterminacy of the parthood relation to be the reason why\ncertain statements involving the parthood predicate lack a definite\ntruth-value, or (ii) one understands the indeterminacy so that\nparthood becomes a genuine matter of degree. Both options,\nhowever, may be articulated in a variety of ways. \n\nOn option (i) (initially favored by such authors as Johnsen and Tye),\nit could once again be argued that no modification of the basic\nmereological machinery is strictly necessary, as long as each\npostulate is taken to characterize the parthood relation insofar as it\nbehaves in a determinate fashion. Thus, on this approach, (P.1) should\nbe understood as asserting that everything is definitely part of\nitself, (P.2) that any definite part of any definite part of a thing\nis itself a definite part of that thing, (P.3) that things that are\ndefinitely part of each other are identical, and so on, and the truth\nof such principles is not affected by the consideration that parthood\nneed not be fully determinate. There is, however, some leeway\nas to how such basic postulates could be integrated with further\nprinciples concerning explicitly the indeterminate cases. For example,\ndo objects with indeterminate parts have indeterminate identity?\nFollowing Evans (1978), many philosophers have taken the answer to be\nobviously in the affirmative. Others, such as Cook (1986), Sainsbury\n(1989), or Tye (2000), hold the opposite view: vague objects are\nmereologically elusive, but they have the same precise identity\nconditions as any other object. Still others maintain that the answer\ndepends on the strength of the underlying mereology. For instance, T.\nParsons (2000: \u00a75.6.1) argues that on a theory such as\nEM cum unrestricted binary\n sums,[27]\n the de re indeterminacy of (65) would be inherited by\n\n\n(66)\nTibbles is identical with the sum of Tibbles and the loose\nwhisker. \n\n\nA related question is: Does countenancing objects with indeterminate\nparts entail that composition be vague, i.e., that there is sometimes\nno matter of fact whether some things make up a whole? A popular view,\nmuch influenced by Lewis (1986b: 212), says that it does. Others, such\nas Morreau (2002: 338), argue instead that the link between vague\nparthood and vague composition is unwarranted: perhaps the de\nre indeterminacy of (65) is inherited by some instances of\n\n\n(67)\nTibbles is composed of x and the loose whisker.\n\n\n\n(for example, x could be something that is just like Tibbles\nexcept that the whisker is determinately not part of it); yet this\nwould not amount to saying that composition is vague, for the\nfollowing might nonetheless be true:\n\n\n(68)\nThere is something composed of x and the loose\nwhisker. \n\n\nFinally, there is of course the general question of how one should\nhandle logically complex statements concerning, at least in part,\nmereologically indeterminate objects. A natural choice is to rely on a\nthree-valued semantics of some sort, the third value being, strictly\nspeaking, not a truth value but rather a truth-value gap. In this\nspirit, both Johnsen and Tye endorse the truth-tables of Kleene (1938)\nwhile Hyde those of \u0141ukasiewicz (1920). However, it is worth\nstressing that other choices are available, including\nnon-truth-functional accounts. For example, Akiba (2000) and Morreau\n(2002) recommend a form of \u201csupervaluationism\u201d. This was\noriginally put forward by Fine (1975) as a theory for dealing with\nde dicto indeterminacy, the idea being that a statement\ninvolving vague expressions should count as true (false) if and only\nit is true (false) on every \u201cprecisification\u201d of those\nexpressions. Still, a friend of de re indeterminacy may\nexploit the same idea by speaking instead of precisifications of the\nunderlying reality\u2014what Sainsbury (1989) calls\n\u201capproximants\u201d, Cohn and Gotts (1996)\n\u201ccrispings\u201d, and T. Parsons (2000)\n\u201cresolutions\u201d of vague objects. As a result, one would be\nable to explain why, for example, (69) appears to be true and (70)\nfalse (assuming that Tibbles's head is definitely part of Tibbles),\nwhereas both conditionals would be equally indeterminate on Kleene's\nsemantics and equally true on \u0141ukasiewicz's:\n\n\n(69)\nIf the loose whisker is part of the head and the head is part of\nTibbles, then the whisker itself is part of Tibbles. \n\n(70)\nIf the loose whisker is part of the head and the head is part of\nTibbles, then the whisker itself is not part of Tibbles. \n\n\nAs for option (ii)\u2014to the effect that de re\nmereological indeterminacy is a matter of degree\u2014the picture is\ndifferent. Here the main motivation is that whether or not something\nis part of something else is really not an all-or-nothing affair. If\nTibbles has two whiskers that are coming loose, then we may want to\nsay that neither is a definite part of Tibbles. But if one whisker is\nlooser than the other, then it would seem plausible to say that the\nfirst is part of Tibbles to a lesser degree than the second,\nand one may want the postulates of mereology to be sensitive to such\ndistinctions. This is, for example, van Inwagen's (1990) view of the\nmatter, which results in a fuzzification of parthood that parallels in\nmany ways to the fuzzification of membership in Zadeh's (1965) set\ntheory, and it is this sort of intuition that also led to the\ndevelopment of such formal theories as Polkowsky and Skowron's (1994)\n\u201crough mereology\u201d or N. Smith's (2005) theory of\n\u201cconcrete parts\u201d. Again, there is room for some leeway\nconcerning matters of detail, but in this case the main features of\nthe approach are fairly clear and uniform across the literature. For\nlet \u03c0 be the characteristic function associated with the parthood\nrelation denoted by the basic mereological primitive, \u2018P\u2019.\nThen, if classically this function is bivalent, which can be expressed\nby saying that \u03c0(x, y) always takes, say, the\nvalue 1 or the value 0 according to whether or not x is part\nof y, to say that parthood may be indeterminate is to say\nthat \u03c0 need not be fully bivalent. And whereas option (i) simply\ntakes this to mean that \u03c0 may sometimes be undefined, option (ii)\ncan be characterized by saying that the range of \u03c0 may include\nvalues intermediate between 0 and 1, i.e., effectively, values from\nthe closed real interval [0, 1]. In other words, on this latter\napproach \u03c0 is still a perfectly standard, total function, and the\nonly serious question that needs to be addressed is the genuinely\nmereological question of what conditions should be assumed to\ncharacterize its behavior\u2014a question not different from the one\nthat we have considered for the bivalent case throughout the preceding\nsections. \n\nThis is not to say that the question is an easy one. As it turns out,\nthe \u201cfuzzification\u201d of the core theory M\nis rather straightforward, but its extensions give rise to various\nissues. Thus, consider the partial ordering axioms (P.1)\u2013(P.3).\nClassically, these correspond to the following conditions on \u03c0\n:\n\n\n(P.1\u03c0)\n\u03c0(x, x) = 1 \n\n(P.2\u03c0)\n\u03c0(x, z) \u2265 min(\u03c0(x,\ny), \u03c0(y, z)) \n\n(P.3\u03c0)\nIf \u03c0(x, y) = 1 and \u03c0(y,\nx) = 1, then x = y, \n\n\nand one could argue that the very same conditions may be taken to fix\nthe basic properties of parthood regardless of whether \u03c0 is\nbivalent. Perhaps one may consider weakening (P.2\u03c0) as\nfollows (Polkowsky and Skowron 1994):\n\n\n(P.2\u03c0\u2032)\nIf \u03c0(y, z) = 1, then \u03c0(x,\nz) \u2265 \u03c0(x, y). \n\n\nOr one may consider strengthening (P.3\u03c0) as follows (N.\nSmith\n 2005):[28]\n\n\n(P.3\u03c0\u2032)\nIf \u03c0(x, y) > 0 and \u03c0(y,\nx) > 0, then x = y. \n\n\nBut that is about it: there is little room for further adjustments.\nThings immediately get complicated, though, as soon as we move beyond\nM. Take, for instance, the Supplementation principle\n(P.4) of MM. One natural way of expressing it in\nterms of \u03c0 is as follows:\n\n\n(P.4\u03c0)\nIf \u03c0(x, y) = 1 and x \u2260\ny, then \u03c0(z, y) = 1 for some z\nsuch that, for all w, either \u03c0(w, z) = 0\nor \u03c0(w, x) = 0. \n\n\nThere are, however, fifteen other ways of expressing (P.4) in terms of\n\u03c0, obtained by re-writing one or both occurrences of \u2018=\n1\u2019 as \u2018> 0\u2019 and one or both occurrences of\n\u2018= 0\u2019 as \u2018< 1\u2019. In the presence of\nbivalence, these would all be equivalent ways of saying the same\nthing. However, such alternative formulations would not coincide if\n\u03c0 is allowed to take non-integral values, and the question of which\nversion(s) best reflect the supplementation intuition would have to be\ncarefully examined. (See e.g. the discussion in N. Smith 2005: 397.)\nAnd this is just the beginning: it is clear that similar issues arise\nwith most other principles discussed in the previous sections, such as\nComplementation, Density, or the various composition principles. (See\ne.g. Polkowsky and Skowron 1994: 86 for a formulation of the\nUnrestricted Sum axiom (P.152).)\n\nOn the other hand, it is worth noting that precisely because the\ndifficulty is mainly technical\u2014the framework itself being fairly\nfirm\u2014now some of the questions raised in connection with option\n(i) tend to be less open to controversy. For example, the question of\nwhether mereological indeterminacy implies vague identity is generally\nanswered in the negative, especially if one adheres to the spirit of\nextensionality. For then it is natural to say that non-atomic objects\nare identical if and only if they have exactly the same parts to the\nsame degree\u2014and that is not a vague matter (a point already made\nin Williamson 1994: 255). In other words, given that classically the\nextensionality principle (27) corresponds to the following\ncondition:\n\n\n(27\u03c0)\nIf there is a z such that either \u03c0(z,\nx) = 1 or \u03c0(z, y) = 1, then x =\ny if and only if, for every z, \u03c0(z,\nx) = \u03c0(z, y), \n\n\nit seems perfectly natural to stick to this condition even if the\nrange of \u03c0 is extended from {0, 1} to [0, 1]. Likewise, the\nquestion of whether mereological indeterminacy implies vague\ncomposition or vague existence is generally answered in the\naffirmative (though not always; see e.g. Donnelly 2009 and Barnes and\nWilliams 2009). Van Inwagen (1990: 228) takes this to be a rather\nobvious consequence of the approach, but N. Smith (2005: 399ff) goes\nfurther and provides a detailed analysis of how one can calculate the\ndegree to which a given non-empty set of things has a sum, i.e., the\ndegree of existence of the sum. (Roughly, the idea is to begin with\nthe sum as it would exist if every element of the set were a definite\npart of it, and then calculate the actual degree of existence of the\nsum as a function of the degree to which each element of the set is\nactually part of it). \n\nThe one question that remains widely open is how all of this should be\nreflected in the semantics of our language, specifically the semantics\nof logically complex statements. As a matter of fact, there is a\ntendency to regard this question as part and parcel of the more\ngeneral problem of choosing the appropriate semantics for fuzzy logic,\nwhich typically amounts to an infinitary generalization of some\ntruth-functional three-valued semantics. The range of possibilities,\nhowever, is broader, and even here there is room for\nnon-truth-functional approaches\u2014including degree-theoretic\nvariants of supervaluationism (as recommended e.g. in Sanford 1993:\n225). \n",
