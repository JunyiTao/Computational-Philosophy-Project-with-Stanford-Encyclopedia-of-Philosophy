    "main_text": "Larger Formations and Historical A Prioris: The Germanic and French Traditions || Thomas Kuhn: Kantian or Hegelian?\n5.1 Thomas Kuhn: Kantian or Hegelian?\n\nKuhn several times described himself as \u201ca Kantian with moveable\ncategories.\u201d Hoyningen-Huene (1993) provides a broadly Kantian\ninterpretation of Kuhn (endorsed by Kuhn himself), as does Friedman\n(2001, 2003, 2010). Given the historical approach of\nStructure, other commentators have likened Kuhn to Hegel\ninstead of Kant. And given the early Kuhn\u2019s view that scientific\nreason is manifested more clearly in historical change as well as in\nnormal scientific practices than in symbolic logical structures,\nKuhn\u2019s early theory of scientific change can be termed very\nbroadly Hegelian. Also fitting the broadly Hegelian frame is\nKuhn\u2019s internalist account of normal scientific research as\nsowing the seeds of its own destruction through unintended innovation,\nresulting eventually in a kind of dialectical conflict that drives the\nenterprise forward. However, there is no Hegelian Spirit lurking\nwithin Kuhn\u2019s model, nor a permanent logic of science as its\nreplacement as there was for Lakatos (Lakatos 1970;\nHoyningen-H\u00fchne 1993; Bird 2008; Worrall 2003, 2008; Nickles\n2009).\n\nKuhn disliked being compared to Hegel, whose work he found obscure and\ncharacterized by a non-naturalistic philosophy of history, but it is\nworth commenting further on the partial resemblance. Both Kant and\nHegel rejected na\u00efve empiricism, according to which all human\nknowledge arises, somehow, from the accumulative aggregation of\nindividual sensations or perceptions. Kant argued that we need\ntranscendental structures such as a system of processing rules in\norder to organize sensory input into something coherent and\nintelligible, e.g., as physical objects interacting causally in space\nand time. These were Kant\u2019s forms of intuition (in space and\ntime) and categories (substance, causality, etc.). They represent the\nhuman mind\u2019s contribution to knowledge. (In this regard Kant can\nbe regarded as a forerunner of cognitive psychology.) Thus, our\nexperience of the world is shaped to fit a priori forms, and this is\nwhere the Kantian version of idealism enters the picture: the world of\nhuman experience is not the world of ultimate reality (Kant\u2019s\nunknowable, noumenal world of things-in-themselves); rather, it is a\nworld shaped by our own cognitive structures.\n\nHegel, one of the founders of the deep conception of historical change\nbroadly characteristic of nineteenth-century German scholarship,\nproceeded to historicize Kant\u2019s innovation, in effect by\nhistoricizing Kant\u2019s categories. They are not inborn, permanent,\nand universal; on the contrary, they are socio-historically acquired\nor lost and hence differ from one historical epoch to another. People\nliving in different epochs cognize the world differently. It is\ntempting to read the Kuhn of Structure as further\nrelativizing and localizing Hegel to specific scientific domains and\ntheir paradigms. Kuhn\u2019s model provides endogenous, dynamic\nmechanisms of (inadvertent) scientific innovations that sow the seeds\nof the paradigm\u2019s eventual destruction in a vaguely Hegelian\nsort of dialectical process. It thus becomes possible to experience a\nchange in categorical scheme within one\u2019s own lifetime\u2014the\nvictory of the new paradigm being the small-scale scientific\ncounterpart of Hegel watching Napoleon march in victory through the\nstreets of Jena! Thus it is tempting to regard Kuhnian revolutions as\nHegelian revolutions writ small.\n\nNonetheless, in terms of historical genealogy, Kuhn is better aligned\nwith the Kantian tradition, especially the neo-Kantian relativization\nof Kant. Interestingly, some logical empiricists (especially\nReichenbach) were influenced by the neo-Kantianism of the German\nMarburg School of philosophy to develop a historically relativized but\nconstitutive a priori (see below and Friedman 2001.)\n",
