    "main_text": "Analyses of Disposition Ascriptions || Conventional and Canonical Dispositions\n1.1 Conventional and Canonical Dispositions\n\nAs is already clear, analyses of dispositions usually proceed on the\nassumption that, for any disposition, we can identify its stimulus\nconditions and manifestations. It is typically said that dispositions\nwould exhibit their \u2018characteristic manifestations\u2019 under\nsome \u2018stimulus conditions\u2019. However, most conventional\ndispositional predicates\u2014\u2018fragile\u2019,\n\u2018soluble\u2019, \u2018malleable\u2019 and the like\u2014make\nno explicit reference to the stimulus conditions and manifestations\nfor the properties they express and the assumption that we are\nnonetheless in a position to identify those stimulus conditions and\nmanifestations is controversial. The stimulus condition and\nmanifestation of (water-)solubility are typically assumed to be the\nevent of being put into water and the event of dissolving,\nrespectively, and perhaps uncontroversially so. But what are the\nmanifestations of fragility? Something like shattering or cracking, it\nseems. But what about splintering, or breaking cleanly in two, or, as\nwith a fragile house of cards, collapsing? It seems hard to say. And\nwhat exactly are the stimulus conditions of fragility? Striking, it\nseems. But what about twisting or shaking? We are at a loss. But do\nthese questions have to do with philosophical understanding of\ndispositions at all?\n\nPartly due to the difficulty of specifying precisely the stimulus\nconditions and manifestations of a disposition and partly due to the\ndoubt over its philosophical relevance, philosophers find it useful to\ndistinguish two sorts of disposition, or alternatively, two ways of\nreferring to dispositions. Conventional dispositions are typically\nexpressed by such simple predicates as \u2018fragile\u2019,\n\u2018soluble\u2019, \u2018flammable\u2019, and so on, which\ninclude no explicit reference to their stimulus conditions and\nmanifestations. Canonical dispositions, on the other hand, are\nexplicit about their stimulus conditions and manifestations, couched\nin the overtly dispositional locution. Some examples of canonical\ndispositions are the disposition to break in response to being struck,\nthe disposition to cause death in response to being ingested, and so\non. Obviously, the two ways of expressing dispositional properties are\nrelated to one another. As noted earlier, (water-)solubility might be\nidentified with the disposition to dissolve in response to being put\ninto water although this kind of identification is not readily\navailable in many other cases of conventional disposition. This\ndistinction between conventional and canonical dispositions allows us\nto keep questions about the adequacy of different analyses of\ndispositions sharply distinct from questions about how to identify the\nstimulus conditions and manifestations of particular dispositions.\n\nHaving introduced this distinction, we can facilitate the quest for an\nanalysis of dispositions by separating two issues, the issue of\nproviding a conceptual analysis of canonical dispositions and the\nissue of explaining conventional dispositions in terms of canonical\ndispositions. What do we mean by saying that \\(x\\) is\npoisonous? The first step for answering this question is to transform\nthe conventional disposition of being poisonous into the corresponding\n(group of) canonical disposition(s) by specifying its stimulus\nconditions and manifestations. The second step is to seek a conceptual\nanalysis of the canonical disposition(s) at hand. On this\n\u2018two-step\u2019 approach, first taken by Lewis (1997), the\nso-called conditional analyses of dispositions we will discuss below\nare designed to help with the second step, saying how to analyze\ncanonical dispositions in terms of counterfactual conditionals. This\napproach has the advantage of allowing us to clarify what it takes to\ngive an analysis of dispositions.\n",
