    "main_text": "\n\nCatharine Macaulay\u2019s most substantial work was the eight-volume A\nHistory of England from the Accession of James I. to that of the\nBrunswick Line, the first volume of which was published in 1763,\nbut the last not until twenty years later. This history, which began\nwith the accession of James 1, and told the history of the English\nCivil War as the outcome of the struggle of the Commons to retain\ntheir liberties against the absolutist tendencies of the Stuarts,\naffirmed the right of the people to depose their monarch. She wrote a\nfurther history, in letters, covering the period after 1688, as well\nas political pamphlets, refuting the monarchism of Hobbes, and the\npolitical conservatism of Burke. She criticized the policy of the\nBritish Government in the lead up to the American War of Independence,\nand was welcomed by the Americans, after Independence, as an important\nadvocate of the principles on which the United States was founded. In\nher pamphlets she defended the right to petition and argued for\ncopyright. Her most philosophical work, A Treatise on the\nImmutability of Moral Truth (1783), developed the doctrine of the\nwill that she called \u201cmoral necessity\u201d; this work was\npartly reproduced in her Letters on Education (1790), which\nwas, in turn, reviewed by, and profoundly influenced, Mary\nWollstonecraft.\n",
