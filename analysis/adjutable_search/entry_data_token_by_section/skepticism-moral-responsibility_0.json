Moral Responsibility Skepticism and Basic Desert\n\nTo begin, it is important to first get clear on what type of moral\nresponsibility is being doubted or denied by skeptics. Most moral\nresponsibility skeptics maintain that our best philosophical and\nscientific theories about the world indicate that what we do and the\nway we are is ultimately the result of factors beyond our control,\nwhether that be determinism, chance, or luck, and because of this\nagents are never morally responsible in the sense needed to justify\ncertain kinds of desert-based judgments, attitudes, or\ntreatments\u2014such as resentment, indignation, moral anger,\nbackward-looking blame, and retributive punishment. This is not to say\nthat there are not other conceptions of responsibility that can be\nreconciled with determinism, chance, or luck. Nor is it to deny that\nthere may be good reasons to maintain certain systems of punishment\nand reward. Rather, it is to insist that to hold people truly\ndeserving of blame and praise, punishment and reward, would be to\nhold them responsible for the results of the morally arbitrary or for\nwhat is ultimately beyond their control, which is fundamentally unfair\nand unjust. Other skeptics defend the more moderate claim that in any\nparticular case in which we may be tempted to judge that an agent is\nmorally responsible in the desert-based sense, we lack the\nepistemic warrant to do so (e.g., Rosen 2004). \n\nDerk Pereboom provides a very helpful definition of the kind of moral\nresponsibility being doubted by skeptics, which he calls basic\ndesert moral responsibility and defines as follows:\n\n\nFor an agent to be morally responsible for an action in this sense is\nfor it to be hers in such a way that she would deserve to be blamed if\nshe understood that it was morally wrong, and she would deserve to be\npraised if she understood that it was morally exemplary. The desert at\nissue here is basic in the sense that the agent would deserve to be\nblamed or praised just because she has performed the action, given an\nunderstanding of its moral status, and not, for example, merely by\nvirtue of consequentialist or contractualist considerations. (2014a:\n2)\n\n\nConsistent with this definition, other moral responsibility skeptics\nhave suggested that we understand basic desert moral responsibility in\nterms of whether it would ever be appropriate for a hypothetical\ndivine all-knowing judge (who didn\u2019t necessarily create the\nagents in question) to administer differing kinds of treatment (i.e.,\ngreater or lesser rewards or punishments) to human agents on the basis\nof actions that these agents performed during their lifetime (see\nCaruso & Morris 2017; cf. G. Strawson 1986, 1994). The purpose of\ninvoking the notion of a divine judge in the afterlife is to instill\nthe idea that any rewards or punishments issued after death will have\nno further utility\u2014be it positive or negative. Any differences\nin treatment to agents (however slight) would therefore seem warranted\nonly from a basic desert sense, and not a consequentialist\nperspective.\n\nMost moral responsibility skeptics distinguish between\nconsequentialist-based and desert-based approaches\nto blame and punishment (see, e.g., Nadelhoffer 2011; Pereboom 2001,\n2014a; Morris, forthcoming; cf. Vargas\n2012a, 2015 who rejects this distinction as too simplistic).\nConsequentialist-based approaches are forward-looking in the sense\nthat agents are considered proper targets of reprobation or punishment\nfor immoral actions on the grounds that such treatment will, say,\nprevent the agent (or other agents) from performing that type of\naction in the future. Desert-based responsibility, on the\nother hand, is considered to be backward-looking and retributivist in\nthe sense that any punitive attitudes or treatments that are deemed\nappropriate responses for an immoral act/decision are warranted simply\nby virtue of the action/decision itself, irrespective of whatever good\nor bad results might follow from the punitive responses (see Morris,\nforthcoming). Understood this way, basic desert moral responsibility\nrequires a kind of power or ability an agent must possess in order to\njustify certain kinds of desert-based judgments, attitudes, or\ntreatments in response to decisions or actions the agent performed or\nfailed to perform. These reactions would be justified on purely\nbackward-looking grounds and would not appeal to consequentialist or\nforward-looking considerations, such as future protection, future\nreconciliation, or future moral formation. It is this kind of moral\nresponsibility that is being denied by moral responsibility skeptics\n(e.g., Pereboom 2001, 2014a; G. Strawson 1986; N. Levy 2011; Waller\n2011, 2014; Caruso 2012; Vilhauer 2009a,b, 2012; Sommers 2009; Focquaert, Glenn, & Raine\nforthcoming).\n\nImportantly, moral responsibility skepticism, while doubting or\ndenying basic desert moral responsibility, is consistent with agents\nbeing responsible in others senses. For instance,\nattributability responsibility is about actions or attitudes\nbeing properly attributable to, or reflective of, an agent\u2019s\nself. That is, we are responsible for our actions in the\nattributability sense only when those actions reflect our identity as\nmoral agents, i.e., when they are attributable to us. Since\nattributability makes no appeal to basic desert or backward-looking\npraise and blame, it remains independent of desert-based\naccountability (see Shoemaker 2011, 2015; Watson 1996; Eshleman 2014)\nand is consistent with moral responsibility skepticism.\n\nThe answerability sense of responsibility defended by Thomas\nScanlon (1998) and Hilary Bok (1998) is also claimed by some skeptics\nto be consistent with the rejection of basic desert (see Pereboom\n2012, 2014a; cf. Jeppsson 2016a). According to this\nconception of responsibility, someone is responsible for an action or\nattitude just in case it is connected to her capacity for evaluative\njudgment in a way that opens her up, in principle, to demands for\njustification from others (Scanlon 1998; Bok 1998; Pereboom 2014a).\nWhen we encounter apparently immoral behavior, for example, it is\nperfectly legitimate to ask the agent, \u201cWhy did you decide to do\nthat?\u201d or \u201cDo you think it was the right thing to\ndo?\u201d If the reasons given in response to such questions are\nmorally unsatisfactory, we regard it as justified to invite the agent\nto evaluate critically what her actions indicate about her intentions\nand character, to demand an apology, or request reform.\n\nAccording to Derk Pereboom (2014a), a leading moral responsibility\nskeptic, engaging in such interactions is reasonable in light of the\nright of those harmed or threatened to protect themselves from immoral\nbehavior and its consequences. In addition, we might have a stake in\nreconciliation with the wrong doer, and calling her to account in this\nway can function as a step toward realizing this objective. We also\nhave an interest in her moral formation, and the address described\nfunctions as a stage in the process. On this forward-looking reading,\nanswerability responsibility is grounded, not in basic desert, but in\nthree non-desert invoking desiderata: future protection, future\nreconciliation, and future moral formation (see Pereboom 2014a).\n\nBasic desert moral responsibility has also been distinguished from\ntake charge responsibility (Waller 1989, 1990, 2004, 2011,\n2014). Bruce Waller, for instance, has argued: \n\n\nJust deserts and moral responsibility require a godlike\npower\u2014the existential power of choosing ourselves, the godlike\npower of making ourselves from scratch, the divine capacity to be an\nuncaused cause\u2014that we do not have\u201d (2011: 40). \n\n\nYet, he maintains, \n\n\nyou [nevertheless] have take-charge responsibility for your own life,\nwhich is a responsibility you deeply value and enjoy\nexercising\u2026 (2011: 108). \n\n\nTaking responsibility is distinguished from being morally\nresponsible in that, if one takes responsibility for a particular\noutcome it does not follow that one is morally responsible for that\noutcome. One can take responsibility for many things, from the mundane\nto the vitally important. For example, one can take responsibility for\nteaching a course, organizing a conference, or throwing a birthday\nparty. The responsibility taken, however, is profoundly different from\nthe moral responsibility that would justify blame and punishment,\npraise and reward (Waller 2011: 105; Pereboom 2001: xxi).\n\nWhile some philosophers may claim (or assume) that taking\nresponsibility entails being morally responsible (e.g., Smilansky\n2012), this seems to conflate a very important distinction. To take\nresponsibility for, say, organizing a conference, is to agree to put\nforth the effort needed to achieve a certain set of goals or\ntasks\u2014e.g., inviting speakers, putting out a CFP, reserving the\nspace, etc. If the conference were to fail for reasons completely\noutside the control of the agent\u2014say there was a major snowstorm\nthat day and several of the speakers could not make it\u2014it would\nremain a separate and open question whether the agent who took charge\nfor organizing the conference was deserving of blame for the failure.\nFor many, the intuition is rather strong that she is not, especially\nin cases where the reasons for failure are external to the agent\n(e.g., a snow storm, canceled flights, etc.). But skeptics would\ncontend that the same remains true when the failure is due to the\nagent\u2019s own flaws (e.g., their laziness) since in a naturalistic\nworld devoid of miracles these too are the result of factors outside\nthe control of the agent (e.g., determinism, chance, or luck).\n",
