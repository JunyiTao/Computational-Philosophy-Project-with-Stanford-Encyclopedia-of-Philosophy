    "main_text": "\n\nModal discourse concerns alternative ways things can be, e.g., what\nmight be true, what isn\u2019t true but could have been, what should\nbe done. This entry focuses on counterfactual\nmodality which concerns what is not, but could or would have\nbeen. What if Martin Luther King had died when he was stabbed in 1958\n(Byrne 2005: 1)? What if the Americas\nhad never been colonized? What if I were to put that box over here and\nthis one over there? These modes of thought and speech have been the\nsubject of extensive study in philosophy, linguistics, psychology,\nartificial intelligence, history, and many other allied fields. These\ndiverse investigations are united by the fact that counterfactual\nmodality crops up at the center of foundational questions in these\nfields.\n\nIn philosophy, counterfactual modality has given rise to difficult\nsemantic, epistemological, and metaphysical questions:\n\nSemantic\u00a0\u00a0 How do we communicate and\nreason about possibilities which are remote from the way things\nactually are?\nEpistemic\u00a0\u00a0 How can our experience in\nthe actual world justify thought and talk about remote\npossibilities?\nMetaphysical\u00a0\u00a0 Do these remote\npossibilities exist independently from the actual world, or are they\ngrounded in things that actually exist?\n\n\nThese questions have attracted significant attention in recent\ndecades, revealing a wealth of puzzles and insights. While other\nentries address the\n epistemic\u2014the epistemology of modality\u2014and\n metaphysical\n questions\u2014possible worlds\n and\n the possibilism-actualism debate\u2014this\n entry focuses on the semantic question. It will aim to refine this\nquestion, explain its central role in certain philosophical debates,\nand outline the main semantic analyses of counterfactuals.\n\nSection 1\n begins with a working definition of counterfactual conditionals\n (\u00a71.1),\n and then surveys how counterfactuals feature in theories of agency,\nmental representation, and rationality\n (\u00a71.2),\n and how they are used in metaphysical analysis and scientific\nexplanation\n (\u00a71.3).\n Section 1.4 then details several ways in which the logic and\ntruth-conditions of counterfactuals are puzzling. This sets the stage\nfor the sections\n 2\n and\n 3,\n which survey semantic analyses of counterfactuals that attempt to\nexplain this puzzling behavior.\n\nSection 2\n focuses on two related analyses that were primarily developed to\nstudy the logic of counterfactuals: strict conditional\nanalyses and similarity analyses. These analyses were not originally\nconcerned with saying what the truth-conditions of particular\ncounterfactuals are. Attempts to extend them to that domain, however,\nhave attracted intense criticism.\n Section 3\n surveys more recent analyses that offer more explicit models of when\ncounterfactuals are true. These analyses include premise semantics\n (\u00a73.1),\n conditional probability analyses\n (\u00a73.2)\n and structural equations/causal models\n (\u00a73.3).\n They are more closely connected to work on counterfactuals in\npsychology, artificial intelligence, and the philosophy of\nscience.\n\nSections\n 2\n and\n 3\n of this entry employ some basic tools from set theory and logical\nsemantics. But these sections also provide intuitive characterizations\nalongside formal definitions, so familiarity with these tools is not a\npre-requisite. Readers interested in more familiarity with these tools\nwill find\n basic set theory,\n as well as Gamut (1991) and Sider\n(2010) useful.\n",
