Culture is\ntransmitted via behavior, and produces durable, non-ephemeral effects\non behavior. Although it is not explicitly mentioned in Ramsey\u2019s\nexplication, variation in behavior, between individuals but\nespecially between groups, has been diagnostically important for those\nseeking to integrate culture and cultural explanations into cognitive\nscience. Many have sought to document patterns of behavioral\ndiversity, and more recently patterns of psychological diversity, and\nshow that they cannot be accounted for by genetic or ecological\ndifferences, but rather are the result of cultural\ndiversity.\n",
