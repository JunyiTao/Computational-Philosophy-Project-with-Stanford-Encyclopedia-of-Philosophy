    "main_text": "\n\n\nThere is no question that the problem of evil vexed Leibniz as much as\nany of the problems that he engaged in the course of his philosophical\ncareer. This is manifest in the fact that the first and the last\nbook-length works that he authored, the\nPhilosopher's Confession (written at age 26 in 1672) and\nthe Theodicy (written in 1709, seven years before his death)\nwere both devoted to this problem, as well as in the fact that in the\nintervening years Leibniz wrote numerous short pieces on related\nissues\u2013\u2013many of which may be found in Gr and will soon be\navailable in English translations currently being undertaken by\nR. C. Sleigh, Jr.\u2013\u2013 and one full-length work,\nthe Dissertation on Predestination and Grace (DPG), which was\nonly published in 2011.  The fact that the Theodicy was the\nonly book-length treatise that Leibniz published during his lifetime\nprovides further evidence of the significance that he attributed to\nthe topic. It is therefore appropriate that it has now become an\ninterpretive commonplace that Leibniz's concern with the problem of\nevil was central to his overarching philosophical concerns throughout\nhis philosophical career.  [See Rutherford (1995) and Antognazza\n(2009).]  Leibniz's approach to the problem of evil became known to\nmany readers through Voltaire's lampoon in Candide: the link\nthat Voltaire seems to forge between Leibniz and the extravagant\noptimism of Dr. Pangloss continues\u2013\u2013for better or\nworse\u2013\u2013to shape the popular understanding of Leibniz's\napproach to the problem of evil.  In this entry we examine the two\nmain species of the problem of evil that Leibniz addresses. The first,\n\u201cthe underachiever problem,\u201d is raised by a critic who\nwould argue that the existence of evil in our world indicates that God\ncannot be as knowledgeable, powerful, or good as traditional\nmonotheists have claimed. The second, \u201cthe holiness\nproblem,\u201d is raised by the critic who would argue that God's\nintimate causal entanglements with the world make God the cause of\nevil. God is thereby implicated in evil to the detriment of his\nholiness.\n\n",
