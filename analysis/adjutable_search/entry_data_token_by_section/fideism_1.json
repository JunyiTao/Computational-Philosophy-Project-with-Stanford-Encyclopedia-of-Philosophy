A Brief History of \u201cFideism\u201d\n\nThe formality of definitions like the one cited by Plantinga is likely\nto conceal underlying disagreements about what counts as a concrete\ninstance of fideism. Indeed, there is little agreement among\nphilosophers about which thinkers can properly be subsumed under this\nrubric. To offer a straight \u201chistory of fideism\u201d would\nthus require one to take up a particular position with respect to a\nseries of ongoing philosophical disputes. This section thus\nattempts \u2013 somewhat less ambitiously, though perhaps more\ncharitably \u2013 to sketch a brief history not of fideism but of\n\u201cfideism\u201d \u2013 i.e., of the term\u2019s (contested)\nusage within the philosophical literature.\n",
