    "main_text": "Contemporary Controversies\n3. Contemporary Controversies\n\nTwo major areas of controversy require attention. First, there are the\nissues concerning how to characterise substance in contradistinction\nto properties and the other categories. There are at least two major\nquestions here. One concerns defining the notion of substance. In\nparticular, there has been much debate about whether substance can be\naccounted for in terms of its special kind of independence.\nThe other is whether substancehood requires some extra component\nbeyond properties, (and, if so, what?) or whether a \u2018bundle of\nproperties\u2019 theory of substance is adequate. Second there is the\nrelation between substances and our practices of individuation and\nreidentification. In particular, we shall look at the issue of whether\nobjects must be individuated under the kind of sortal expressions that\ncorrespond to Aristotelian substance concepts, or whether a more\ngeneric notion, such as physical body, will suffice. This\nlatter concern will lead on to a consideration of the connection\nbetween substance and teleology.\n3.1. How substances are distinguished from things in other categories\n\nOne natural response to the question of what distinguishes substances\nfrom properties is that properties depend for their existence on\nsubstances, for they are properties of objects (that is, of\nindividual substances), but that substances do not similarly depend on\nproperties for their existence. The point cannot be made quite so\nsimply, however. Properties could not exist without objects to be\nproperties of, but neither could substances exist without properties,\nso the dependence appears to be mutual.\n\nThis problem can be overcome by more careful expression of the point,\nmaking it clear that we are not talking about properties in general\nand substances in general, but about particular instances or cases of\na property and the particular objects to which they belong. A\nparticular property instance cannot exist and could not have existed\nwithout the substance of which it is a property, but the particular\nsubstance can exist and could have existed without that property\ninstance. Thus, a particular instance of colour cannot exist, and\ncould not have existed, without the object of which it is the colour,\nbut the object can exist without the colour instance, for it may\nchange colour and remain the same object, or it could have had a\ndifferent colour from the start.\n\nVarious problems can be raised for this account. The most obvious is\nthat it does not, as stated, distinguish between substances and\nevents. Some property-instances belong to events rather than\nsubstances. The performance of a symphony, for example, is an event,\nand it may possess the property, in one of its movements, of being\nallegro. It seems plausible that this particular case of\nsomething\u2019s being allegro could not have been exemplified by\nanother performance, but the performance might go on to be andante in\nanother movement, so the event can continue to exist without that\noriginal property. The assimilation of events with substances in this\nway seems strained, however. It does not seem natural to say that the\nsame event was first allegro, then andante, because it is more natural\nto attribute the different properties to different parts of the event,\nwhich are themselves events (in this case, movements). This\nbrings out a major difference between substances and events, namely\nthat the temporal parts of events are themselves events in their own\nright, but the temporal parts of objects\u2014meaning by that\nexpression the temporal phases of an object\u2019s\nexistence\u2014are not themselves objects. Indeed, it is not natural\nto talk of the temporal parts of objects, though some philosophers\n(led by David Lewis (1986), but see also Sider (2001), Hawley (2001)\nand the entry on\n temporal parts)\n think that there are compelling philosophical reasons for doing so.\nThe rationale implicit in our ordinary concept is that an object is\nwholly present at all the temporal points of its existence. I say\n\u2018implicit rationale\u2019, because it seems no more natural to\nspeak of an object as being \u2018wholly present at all temporal\npoints of its existence\u2019 than it is to say that it has objects\nas its temporal parts. Nevertheless, one does not think of a\nlong-lived object as consisting of a series of short-lived objects\nstacked end to end, but one does think it natural to think of a\ndrawn-out event as consisting of a series of shorter events. If it is\nnot natural to think of objects as having objects as their temporal\nparts, this seems to commit one to thinking of objects as wholly\npresent at all times of their existence, strange though this form of\nexpression may also be.\n\nThe difference between substances, events and properties can now be\nexpressed as follows. Substances and events are distinguished from\nproperties by the fact that properties are the kinds of things the\ninstances of which depend for their existence on the particular\nsubstance or event by which they are instantiated, whereas substances\nand events are such as not to depend for their existence on particular\ninstances of properties. And substances are distinguished from events\nin the following way: events are those property-instantiators that,\nwhen they exist through time, are temporally composed of further\nthings of the same category (i.e., events): substances are those\nproperty-instantiators that, when they exist through time, are not\ntemporally composed of things of the same category (i.e., of\nsubstances) but endure singly through the period.\n\nLowe, in his (1998), which contains a very thorough discussion of all\nthe topics discussed in this section, defends an\n\u2018independence\u2019 account of substance, which he states in\nterms of identity, as follows:\n\nx is a substance if and only if x is a particular\nand there is no particular y such that y is not\nidentical to x and the identity of x depends on the\nidentity of y.\n\n\nHe considers two objections to his own account which would seem to\napply to all independence accounts. One is that it cannot\ncope with essential properties, for it seems to imply that, for any\ngiven property-instance, a substance can exist without it, which is\nnot true of essential properties. The other is that it cannot cope\nwith the necessity of origin for individual identity.\n\nLowe responds to the former objection by saying that essential\nproperties are identical with the substance, so cannot be cited as\nsomething other than substance that meets his criterion for being\nsubstance. It is not clear that this will work. The idea that the\nessence is identical with the substance is Aristotelian, but\nit is not clear how this applies to essential properties, taken\nindividually. We have already seen, in our discussion of Aristotle,\nthat the relation between the essence as some kind of unity and the\nproperties that seem to constitute it is not clear. He copes with the\nsecond by denying that origin is essential to identity. Unfortunately,\nhe argues for this position by citing human subjects: Socrates, for\nexample, would still have been who he was even if he had had different\nparents. This is, of course, controversial about humans, but it is our\nCartesian intuitions that make it plausible in that case. That this\ntable, for example, could have been the same object even if made from\ndifferent material does not have the same plausibility. \n\nWhether these objections to the above versions of the\nindependence account can be answered is unclear. Hoffman and\nRosenkrantz (1994 and 1997) develop a different, though probably not\nincompatible, conception of the relative independence of substances\ncompared to other categories. Substance, they say, is the only\ncategory of thing that might have only one instance through at least a\nminimally extended period of time. Thus, for example, there is no\npossible world that has, in a given period of time, only one event,\nfor any non-instantaneous event will be made of events that are its\nparts. Similarly for properties or tropes, there can never be only one\nbecause any one entails the existence of others, as, for example, the\nexistence of a red property (instance) entails the existence of (an\ninstance of) the property colour. By contrast, there could exist\nthrough a period of time just one substance, provided that it was\natomic.\n\nAs Mackie (2000) points out, the full statement of this theory\ninvolves various relatively ad hoc restrictions. More importantly, it\ndoes not seem to explain what unifies the category of substance, for\nit does not say that it is true of any substance that it could\nconceivably be the only substance existing for a period of\ntime\u2014indeed, it could not apply to non-atomic substances, for\ncomplex ones can exist only if other substances\u2014those that\nconstitute their parts\u2014also exist. It implies only that\nsomething from the category of substance might so exist and\nthat this could not be true of any other category. One might wonder\nwhat enabled substances that could not exist alone to count as\nsubstances at all.\n\nIf either of the above accounts are successful, substances, properties\nand events are distinguished. The question remains, however, how far\nthese are nominal and how far real distinctions. That there is a\ndifference between substance concepts and property concepts has\ndefinitely been shown, but does it follow that there are, in reality\ntwo different kinds of thing, namely properties and\nsubstances? The answer might seem to be obvious. Given that there are\nsubstance concepts, if those concepts are instantiated, then there are\nsubstances in reality. Cat, table, human\nbeing, are substance concepts by the above accounts, and there\nare cats, tables and humans, so there are substances in reality as\nwell as properties.\n\nThe matter is not so simple, however. It is possible, and not\nuncommon, for concepts of a certain kind to be exemplified, but for it\nto be the case that, nevertheless, entities answering directly to\nthose concepts are not included in the most economical statement of\none\u2019s ontology. This is reductionism, and it can operate in\neither of two ways, namely either analytical reductionism or what one\nmight call de facto or \u2018nothing but\u2019 reductionism. In the\npresent case, it would conform to the analytical option if the concept\nof substance could be analysed in terms of properties or events (e.g.,\n\u2018to be a substance =df to be a collection of properties bound\ntogether in way W\u2019). But one might still hold that, though the\nconcept of substance is not precisely analysable and is indispensable,\nsubstances in fact are nothing but collections of properties.\nThis latter is the de facto option. So the existence of substances\ndoes not show that the concept is important from a philosophical\nperspective, or, if it has some significance, whether this is just as\na necessary part of our conceptual scheme, or as an ineliminable\nfeature of reality itself.\n3.2 Bundle theories versus substratum and \u2018thin particulars\u2019\n3.2.1 Bundle theories and their problems\n\nWe have just noted that there could be analytically reductionist or de\nfacto reductionist accounts of substance in terms of properties. It is\nalso the case that the properties might be conceived of as universals,\nor as individuals\u2014that is, property-instances, which are\nsometimes called \u2018tropes\u2019. There are, therefore, four\noptions for the bundle theorist.\n\nThe concept of substance can be analysed in terms of some relation\nbetween properties conceived of as universals.\nThe concept of substance can be analysed in terms of properties\nconceived of as individuals, e.g., as property-instances or\ntropes.\nSubstances are in fact no more than bundles of properties\nconceived of as universals.\nSubstances are in fact no more than bundles of properties\nconceived of as individuals.\n\n\nThe main objections to the \u2018universals\u2019 form of the theory\nrest on its apparent commitment to the Identity of Indiscernibles, for\nif an object is no more than a bundle of properties, then if\na and b have exactly the same properties, they are\nthe same bundle. Whether it does carry this commitment may depend on\nwhether one allows spatial points as particulars, in addition to the\nproperties that are universal. If one did, then the universal theories\nwould not entail the identity of indiscernibles, for the same\nuniversals could be in two bundles by being at two different\nlocations.\n\nIf properties are conceived of as individuals\u2014otherwise known as\ntropes, property-instances or individualised forms\u2014then there\ncannot be a problem about the distinctness of exactly similar bundles,\nfor the difference is built into the identity of the elements of the\nbundle, as it is not if the bundle is made of universals. The problem\nfor this version of the bundle theory seems to be that it is difficult\nto individuate or distinguish tropes in a way that makes them suitable\nto be individuals\u2014in one sense, the substances\u2014from which\nobjects are made (Armstrong 1989: 115ff). For example, if an object\nhas a size, a mass, and a motion, are the size and the mass different\ntropes and is it not strange to think of the size alone as a genuine\nparticular suited to be treated as an \u2018atomic\u2019 component\nof the whole? One way out of this problem may be to resort to the\nnotion of a master property that was invoked in the discussion of\nLocke on substratum\n (section 2.5.1);\n that is, to the notion of one property of which all the others are\nmodes, as visual shape is a mode of colour, or extension is the master\nproperty of matter for Descartes. In the Newtonian model, solidity\nmight fill this role, for shape is merely the outline of the solidity\nwhich constitutes the heart of the object. In a sense, theories of\nthis kind are not ordinary bundle theories, for one property is chosen\nto fill the role of substratum, because the other properties inhere\nin, or are modes of, it. Whether anything could perform this role from\namongst the properties that are basic to modern, post-Newtonian\nphysics\u2014properties such as charm, energy, spin and mass\u2014is\nnot easy to judge.\n\nOne objection often made against the theory is that bundles are\nmereological sums, rather like Locke\u2019s \u2018masses of\nmatter\u2019, and that, therefore, any change of property is a change\nin the identity of the object. Various forms of essentialist solutions\nto this problem have been suggested, for example, by Simons (1994),\nand Barker and Jago (2018). I must admit to having difficulties seeing\nwhy the view that objects are constituted solely out of\nproperty-instances should commit one to a mereological view, any more\nthan the theory that they are constituted solely from material\nparticles would, so I do not see this as a special problem for the\nbundle theory.\n3.2.2. The concept of substratum or \u2018thin particular\u2019\n\nIf one is not satisfied with a bundle theory of substance, so that one\nthinks that an individual substance is more than a collection of\nproperties, how is one to understand this \u2018more\u2019? This\nquestion can be given a deflationary or a substantive answer. The\ndeflationary answer is that a substance is a thing which has\nproperties, and that is all one needs to say (see, for example, Crane\nand Farkas 2004, 143f, and Chisholm 1969). An object is not composed\nof properties and some further ingredient\u2014the\n\u2018thingy\u2019 bit\u2014an object is something that simply has\nproperties. Any feature of it can, of course, be regarded as a\nproperty, but that does not render an object nothing but a collection\nof properties. There seems to be a clash of intuitions at this point\nabout what makes sense. An opponent of the deflationary view will say\nthat properties, however understood, must be components of objects,\nconceptually or formally speaking. If they are not the only components\nin this sense, one must say something about the nature of the rest.\nThe deflationist thinks that this line of thought embodies some kind\nof category mistake in the way it handles the idea of a component. The\nanti-deflationist will argue that the fact that we are talking about\ncomponents only in a conceptual sense does not alter the fact that we\nare obliged, once we start, to offer an account that is complete and\ndistinguishes the various elements.\n\nBennett offers one way out of the need to postulate a mysterious\nsubstratum:\n\nWhen I say \u2018This is an orange\u2019 I mean that there are here\ninstances of certain properties such as orangeness, sphericality etc.,\nand I indicate that I am operating on my ideas of those instances\nin a certain combining manner. (1987: 202; italics added)\n\n\nThis solution, as Bennett recognises, makes substancehood a function\nof how we operate on the properties we perceive. It is, in that sense,\nmore Kantian than realist. As what it recognises as out there in the\nworld is just a bundle of properties, it does not dissolve the problem\nin the way that a deflationist would require.\n\nSubstantive theories take the thought of a further component\nseriously, and, though they do not seem to be generally distinguished,\nthere are two main conceptions of this extra element, which I will\ncall the \u2018thin particular\u2019 and the\n\u2018substratum\u2019 conceptions. \u2018Thin particular\u2019 is\nan expression of D. M. Armstrong\u2019s. It is the particular in\nabstraction from its properties. When considered with its properties\nit is a thick particular. The important point is that thin\nparticulars really are particulars. \u2018Bertrand Russell might have\nbeen a fried egg\u2019: that is, the thin particular associated with\none set of properties and, hence, with one thing, might have belonged\nto another. Different properties might have been hung on this hook. It\nis not so clear, by contrast, that a substratum of the kind Locke\nconsiders, or like Aristotle\u2019s prime matter, is a particular in\nthis sense. It is more like a kind of stuff\u2014the substantiveness\non to which properties are stuck. On this conception, the suggestion\nthat the \u2018piece\u2019 of substratum or \u2018prime\nmatter\u2019 that is here in object a, might always\ninstead have been there in object b, seems to lack\ncontent.\n\nIt is useful at this point to take note of the three different\nfunctions the thin particular or substratum might fulfil. Its role\nmight be (i) to bind the properties into a unity, so that they do not\n\u2018fall apart\u2019: (ii) to individualise them, if they are\nuniversals: (iii) to carry one across the categorial barrier from\nproperty to substance; that is, to be what it is that makes something\nto be in the category of substance.\n\nThe first role will not be necessary if one thinks that there is a\n\u2018master property\u2019 of which the others are modes, or if one\nthinks that unity can come from some causal or organisational\nconnection. (ii) will not apply to a tropist theory, or if one thinks\nthat location will do the job. (iii) rests on the intuition that no\ncollection of properties could, in themselves, amount to a\nsubstance: the very idea is a category mistake, and only the\npresence of a special \u2018substantializing\u2019 element could do\nthat. It might be argued that this intuition begs the question against\nthe bundle theory. At the current state of the debate, it looks as if\nthere is no compelling reason for accepting substratum.\n3.3 Substances and sortals\n\nThe Aristotelian tradition anchors the concept of substance, at least\nin nature, primarily to instances of species of natural object. The\nKantian tradition ties it to those enduring bodies the individuation\nof which gives sense and structure to our spatio-temporal framework.\nDavid Wiggins (1967, 1980, 2001) has made a sustained attempt to prove\nthat these two objectives necessarily go together and to make the\nAristotelian notion of substance, even including its bias towards the\nbiological, central to our practice of individuating objects.\n\nWiggins assumes that individuating a temporally enduring object\ninvolves being able to re-identify it at different times and under\ndifferent descriptions. This assumption makes it possible to state\nsubstance individuation using the language of identity. Within the\nscope of this assumption, he makes two claims. The first is the sortal\nrelativity of identity: that is, when any a and b\nare asserted to be the same thing, they must be the same\nsomething-or-other, and the something-or-other must\nbe the kind of concept that answers \u2018what is it?\u2019\nquestions. In other words, there is no such a thing as \u2018bare\nidentity\u2019\u2014identity under no concept at all. Furthermore,\nthe relevant concept must be an Aristotelian substance concept or\nsortal. More formally, this can be expressed as follows:\n\nIf a = b then (a) there is a sortal F such\nthat:\n\n\na is an F\nb is an F\na is the same F as b.\n\n\n\nThe second claim is that is that if the object picked out by\n\u2018a\u2019 also falls under another sortal, G,\nthen so will the object picked out by \u2018b\u2019, and it\nwill be the same G as a. This is represented as an\napplication of Leibniz\u2019s Law, for if a is\nthe-same-G-as-a (as it must be) then, as a\n= b, b must be\nthe-same-G-as-a.\n\n(b) for any sortal G,\n\n\na is G iff b is G,\nif a is G then b is the same G\nas a.\n\n\n\nThe conclusion is striking because it is a denial that a and\nb might be identical under one form of identification, but\nnot under another. In fact it implies that every individuable object\nfalls under just one ultimate sortal. (Wiggins admits this in 2001: 67\nn.7. What is meant by ultimate sortal will emerge below.) For\nevery ultimate sortal has its own principle of individuation, and if\nan object fell under more than one, there could be a time at which it\nsatisfied the criteria for one and not for the other. Wiggins\u2019s\nthesis is a very strong claim, apparently backed up by a powerful\nargument. It is a strong claim for it purports to prove that any world\nwith individuable objects must be constituted by Aristotelian\nsubstances. The argument is powerful because it follows by simple\nlogic, granted seemingly plausible claims about identity, and\nLeibniz\u2019s Law.\n\nOn the other hand, there seem to be many cases of objects, which can\nbe identified under a variety of concepts, leading to different life\nhistories. This is termed relativity of identity. For\nexample, a and b may be the same person but not the\nsame child because b is a grown up and no longer a child. Or\na and b may be the same lump of clay but not the\nsame statue because b is the lump after it has been reshaped\nout of its statue shape. These are the most typical kinds of counter\nexamples and Wiggins has responses to both. He deals with the first by\ninvoking the concept of a phase sortal. A phase sortal is one\nthat, by its meaning, denotes part of the life history of something,\nwhich, as a whole, is denoted by another sortal. So child is\na phase sortal that applies to a phase of the things fully designated\nby human being. This illuminates an important aspect of the\nconcept of a sortal. It is a necessary condition for\nF\u2019s being an ultimate sortal that, whenever it applies\nto something, it applies in a present-tensed manner to the thing\nthrough the whole of its existence.\n\nThe statue and the lump of clay are dealt with by denying that the\nlump and the statue are identical: the lump of clay\nconstitutes the statue, but is not identical with it. Notice\nthat he could have argued that the statue was just a phase of the\nlump, but he does not do so because statue is not, by its\nvery meaning, a phase sortal: statue, unlike child,\ndoes not indicate by its meaning a period in the existence of\nsomething.\n\nSo Wiggins deals with objections mainly by two distinctions. One is\nbetween sortals that apply to objects through the whole of their\nexistence, and sortals appropriate only to a phase of their existence:\nthe other is between the \u2018is\u2019 of identity and the\n\u2018is\u2019 of constitution. Correspondingly, criticism centres\non whether the concepts under which we pick things out behave in as\nregimented a way as Wiggins requires, and on whether the\n\u2018is\u2019 of constitution is sufficiently different from the\n\u2018is\u2019 of identity to perform the task he wants of it.\n3.3.1 The discipline of sortal identification\n\nThere are certain kinds of counter-example that Wiggins does not\ndiscuss in print. There might, for example, be a sword-stick, which\nhas its blade removed and the inside of the cane filled with resin, so\nthat it ceases to be a sword but remains the same walking stick.\nWalking stick and sword are perfectly good concepts\nfor picking out objects, if any artefactual terms are, and, on pain of\nexcessive artificiality, a sword-stick is both a sword and a walking\nstick. This kind of example does not appear to occur amongst natural\nobjects, but, as a sword-stick is a perfectly good reidentifiable\nobject, this fact about natural objects would seem to be a contingent\ntruth about them. Of course, it is not an accident that\nnature works that way, but neither is it a conceptual requirement.\nWiggins\u2019s original proof was a priori, and it should allow no\nexceptions. Wiggins\u2019s response to this example (in personal\ncommunication) is that the sword-stick ceases to exist when it loses\nits ability to function as a sword and is replaced by a walking stick.\nBut this response too is ad hoc. It embodies the principle\nthat if anything is both an F and a G, where\nF and G are normally ordinary sortals, then it is\nreally an F/G and ceases to exist if it loses either\nits F or its G features and is replaced by something\nthat is either just an F or just a G.\n\nOne possible way out of this kind of case is to say that the sword is\na phase of the walking stick, thereby introducing ad hoc phase\nsortals. By the expression \u2018ad hoc phase sortal\u2019 I mean a\nsortal that can be used sometimes as a phase sortal, designating an\nobject only through part of its existence, and sometimes as an\nultimate sortal, designating an object through the whole of its\nexistence. Of course, even a normal phase sortal might, contingently,\nin a given instance, designate an object through the whole of its\nexistence. One might say that the phase sortal baby could\ndesignate something through the whole of its existence if, for\nexample, a human being died at the age of six months and hence never\ngot beyond babyhood. But it remains the case that, by dint of the\nmeaning of the term, a baby is a phase of a human being (or, perhaps,\nsome other animal) even when a particular creature fails to get beyond\nthat phase. A sword is not, however, in virtue of the meaning of the\nword \u2018sword\u2019, a phase of anything, and to use the term to\nname a phase of something in a given case, when it suits, is ad hoc.\nAllowing sortals of this kind would put the concept of sortal under\npressure, for an ultimate sortal was originally thought to be a kind\nof concept that necessarily characterises an object present-tensedly\nthroughout its existence, not a concept that sometimes does and\nsometimes does not. If it were possible for a given sortal, such as\nsword, sometimes to be an ultimate sortal and sometimes a\nphase sortal, it is not clear how such an expression would differ from\nan expression such as brown thing, which may or may not\ncharacterise something through the whole of its existence. But it is\nvital that the distinction between sortals, phase or ultimate, and\nexpressions such as brown thing be clearly maintained, if the\nnotion of sortal is to serve any formal purpose.\n\nMore importantly, that there are no ad hoc sortals is essential to the\nsignificance of the formal proof that there is no such thing as\nrelative identity. In logic and in the application of Leibniz\u2019s\nLaw, \u2018a is F\u2019 is normally equivalent to\n\u2018a was, is or will be F\u2019, otherwise the\nLaw would not apply to such accidental properties as \u2018is\nbrown\u2019. This is also the way phase sortals work: a human being\nis, was, or will be a baby. The argument against relative identity\nworks by arguing that, if one allowed relative identity, a\ncontradiction would follow, namely that one would get a situation in\nwhich a is G, a = b and b\nis not G. For this to be a contradiction, \u2018is\nG\u2019 must be univocal in both cases as either\n\u2018\u2014was, is or will be G\u2019 or \u2018\u2014is\nat all times G\u2019. For there is no inconsistency in\na is, was, or will be G, a = b,\nand b is not at all times G. But if, whenever a\ncontradiction is generated, one deems one of the sortals to be a phase\nsortal, and so to fall under the \u2018is, was, or will be\u2019\nrubric, and the other to be the ultimate sortal which applies at all\ntimes, no contradiction will ever arise. All the cases of putative\nrelative identity could be reconciled with Leibniz\u2019s Law by\ndeeming one of the sortals to be operating as a phase sortal in this\ninstance.\n\nAnother possible line is that a sword-stick is not one object, but two\nobjects that share some of their matter. This introduces a category of\nwhat one might call Siamese objects. It can be argued,\nhowever, that allowing this kind of entity undermines Wiggins\u2019s\nopposition to those, like Ayers, who think that the concept for\nreidentifying objects is, or often is, something more generic than\nsortal concepts; something akin to material body. To see how\nthis may come about, we must consider the rationale for Ayers\u2019s\ntheory.\n\nThe fact that sortals do not seem to follow the discipline that\nWiggins wishes for them might be taken to support the view that\nsubstances can be individuated under much more generic notions, such\nas same body or same material thing (Ayers 1991a).\nOn this view, material cohesion is what picks out paradigmatic\nphysical things. Wiggins regards these ideas as too generic to be\nadequate on their own. Such a concept cannot be \u201cunderstood\nexcept as determinable that has dog, horse,\nball, [etc] among its determinations\u201d (1997:\n417\u20138).\n\nAyers, on the other hand, thinks that Wiggins takes the notion of body\ntoo loosely, because he [Wiggins] classifies as \u2018lump-mass\nterms\u2019 everything from bars of soap and pats of butter to pools\nof water and pots of stew (Ayers 1991b: 229\u201330). Wiggins, in\nother words, does not take seriously enough the cohesiveness of real\nbodies, conflating them too easily with looser masses of matter. One\nnatural thought is that we can reidentify middle-sized physical bodies\nthat have fairly stable properties, irrespective of whether there is\nany interesting sortal term under which they fall. This is not to say\nthat they could be reidentified under the purely generic notions\nbody or physical thing, if there were no continuity\nof manifest properties.\n\nThat this may be a powerful criticism of Wiggins\u2019s view can be\nseen by considering the notion of a Siamese object, which seemed to be\nnecessary to answer the kind of problem posed by the sword-stick. The\nphysical mass that houses both the sword and the walking stick can be\nidentified independently of either. If this were not the case it is\ndifficult to see how one could even make the mistake of thinking of it\nas one thing. The composites Siamese entities form are quite\nidentifiable, and yet that entity is not supposed to fall under a\nsortal in its own right.\n\nThe ontological status of complex bodies and \u2018masses of\nmatter\u2019 (in Locke\u2019s phrase) is an issue very much under\ndispute and we shall return to it below.\n3.3.2 The \u2018is\u2019 of constitution\n\nA statue and a lump of clay occupy the same place at a given time.\nWhat is their relation to each other? The apparent options are (i)\nthey are identical (ii) they are not identical, but the clay\nconstitutes the statue. (i) appears to be ruled out because they have\ndifferent identity conditions. (ii) has seemed to many philosophers to\nbe the natural solution to the problem, but it, too, faces\ndifficulties. First, it has the intuitive disadvantage that it\nallocates two solid physical objects to the same place. Each of them\nweighs, say, ten pounds, yet the total of their weight is only ten\npounds. It might seem natural to think\u2014and it was formerly a\nwell established maxim\u2014that there can be only one solid physical\nthing at one place at a given time. Someone impressed by the idea that\ntwo bodies cannot be in the same place at the same time might think it\nmore natural to say that there are two different ways of\nconceptualising the material presence at that point, than that there\nare two material things. That way it is easy to see why two ten pound\nobjects need not add up to twenty pounds when put together.\n\nSecond, the language of constitution is more natural if the situation\nis described in some ways rather than others. It is natural to say\nthat the statue is made of clay or even from a piece of clay.\nBut suppose one characterises the clay more exactly, in terms of the\nparticular atoms in a particular arrangement. Strictly, on modal\ngrounds, this structured collection and the statue are different. The\nstatue could have been made of a collection of atoms with at least\nsome different members, but the entity defined as containing just\nthose atoms could not. This entity\u2014atoms\nA1\u2026An in given spatial arrangement\nS\u2014is not a very natural kind of object, but it is a real body,\nin a way that something arbitrarily composed of, for example, half of\nthis table and two toes from President Bush\u2019s left foot is not.\nThis collection of atoms in this structure is what investigation would\nshow to be really there. Though it is natural to say that the statue\nis constituted by the atoms, it is less natural to say that the atoms\nand the structure taken together, are what it is made from: rather it\nmight seem natural to say that that is what it is. To use the\nAristotelian terminology, there is strong pressure to say that atoms\nand structure together are matter and form, and hence are the\ncomplete individual.\n\nAll these issues are very controversial, and different philosophers\nhave different intuitions (see, for example, Rea 1997). But, if one\nwere to conclude that the statue and the lump are neither identical\nnor stand in the constitution relation, what else could one say? One\nstrategy is to take the notion of body or material\nobject as basic. In the next section, this possibility is\ncompared with other options.\n3.3.3 A possible reconciliation of Wiggins and Ayers.\n\nAs we saw above, for Wiggins the concept \u2018body\u2019 is always\ngeneric, never sufficient in its own right to sustain identification,\nneeding to be filled out by appeal to a more determinate sortal, such\nas \u2018dog\u2019 or \u2018table\u2019. Call this\n\u2018sortalism\u2019.\n\nFor Ayers, on the other hand the notion of a coherent, unified body or\nmaterial object is the basic notion for individuating objects and is\npresupposed by sortal concepts. It is only in so far as dogs and\ntables are unified bodies that these notions can be used to\nindividuate objects. Call this \u2018somatism\u2019.\n\nWe saw, briefly, in\n section 3.3.1,\n why Wiggins and Ayers think as they do. Although van Inwagen\u2019s\nposition is different from both, his reasons for thinking that the\nconcept of a complex body is, of its own, an inadequate\nconcept, are consistent with Wiggins\u2019s claim that the idea is\ntoo determinable to function in its own right. Van Inwagen, therefore,\nmore directly challenges Ayers. (For a brief discussion of van\nInwagen\u2019s argument, see\n section 3.4\n below.)\n\nHow might we choose between sortalism and somatism? The dispute\nbetween them can seem difficult to pin down. Perhaps an irenic\ncompromise is possible. Metaphysically, this compromise favours the\nsomatist, but seems to give the sortalist everything he should want.\nThe principle of the compromise is that Wiggins\u2019s formal\nargument is correct: and hence it is necessarily true that Relative\nIdentity is not possible. But it is only a contingent truth that the\nterms that can substitute for F in his formal proof are\ngenerally\u2014but not always\u2014sortals of an Aristotelian kind.\nAnything can be substituted for F that picks the object out\nas a unified body.\n\nTake Wiggins\u2019s formula, a =F\nb, where it is assumed that the F is a material\nobject (not God or a spirit etc). The following theses might plausibly\nbe maintained.\n\nFor any identifiable and re-identifiable object, there must be\nsome predicate F that applies to it in a present-tense manner\nthrough the whole of its existence, and that, by its meaning, picks\nthe object out as a unified physical whole.\nAll natural ultimate sortals designate unified physical bodies in\nthe manner prescribed in (1), and so are very suitable as\nsubstitutions for F. It is logically possible, however, that\nthis might not have been so (there might logically have been natural\nsortals that worked like sword-stick), but that they do\nfollow this model, and are not like sword-stick, is a pretty deep fact\nabout our world and about any world with similar laws of nature to\nthose that hold in our world.\nArtefactual sortals generally designate distinct, unified bodies\n(as do \u2018sword\u2019 and \u2018walking stick\u2019 in the\nordinary cases), though exceptions (as in the case of the sword-stick\nconsidered above) are more common and less fantastic than in the\nnatural cases.\nThere are acceptable substitutions for F that would not\nnormally be classified as sortals, but using concepts such as\npiece, or hunk or lump of stuff. In at\nleast some of these cases, there is no sortal available.\n\u2018[Unified] body\u2019 could always do the job of\nF, because other, more specific, terms work just because the\nthings they designate are unified bodies. On its own, \u2018same\nbody\u2019 is just not very explanatory.\n\n\nThe account given in these five points has the advantage that it is\ncompatible with the fact that most identities involving\nreidentification are categorisable under sortals, but that there are\nother cases\u2014such as \u2018piece of\u2026\u2019, \u2018hunk\nof\u2026\u2019\u2014where this is not so. It also avoids the need\nto employ the \u2018\u201cis\u201d of constitution\u2019 to link\nsortals and particulars, like lumps and hunks, rather than just mass\nterms, such as \u2018clay\u2019 or \u2018gold\u2019. The case\nwhere the lump and the sortally individuated object do not coincide,\napplies only to some problematic artefactual cases, and in those cases\nthe sortal name of the artefact will not be suitable substitute for\nF, but the \u2018lump\u2019 expression will be. In that\nway, it will be possible to avoid the need to have two material\nobjects in the same place.\n3.4 Contemporary hylomorphism\n\nSince about the mid 1990s there has developed a debate covering\nsimilar territory to that disputed by Wiggins and Ayers, but having\nrather different roots. It claims to be a revival of a broadly\nAristotelian hylomorphism, but it comes mainly from disputes in\nmereology.\n\nDavid Lewis famously propounded the doctrine of Unrestricted\nComposition: that is, any combination of things in the world\nconstitutes a further thing (e.g., 1986, 211). So my left foot and any\narbitrary stone at the bottom of the sea constitutes an object, though\nan object of no descriptive or explanatory interest. In the opposite\ncorner, Peter van Inwagen (1990) denied that there was any such thing\nas composition, at least for inanimate material objects.\n\nVan Inwagen\u2019s main argument is that necessary and sufficient\n(particularly sufficient) conditions cannot be given for the kind of\ncohesion of parts that is supposed to bind atoms into complexes. None\nof the standard candidates\u2014contact, fastening, adhesion, fusion,\nnor any acceptable disjunction of them\u2014will suffice. They all\nhave counterexamples. So the notion cannot be well defined. The\narguments are subtle and interesting. The question might be raised\nwhether van Inwagen gives sufficient consideration to the possibility\nof taking a line similar to that taken by Putnam on natural kinds. One\nfixes putative paradigm cases of non-living complexes, and says that\nthe kind of cohesion required is whatever sort of bonding holds in\nthose cases. It seems unlikely that there will not be a reasonably\ntidy, scientific account of how atoms bond. Nevertheless, van\nInwagen\u2019s mereological nihilism has a stopping point, namely\nthat he believes that he, though a composite material object, really\ndoes exist. So organisms do exist.\n\nVan Inwagen\u2019s unwillingness (unlike the early Unger (1975)) to\napply the nihilism to himself, and others like him, prompted the\nthought in other philosophers that there may be a way of having a\ndoctrine of Restricted Composition on the basis of being things of the\nright kind\u2014namely having a structure of the right kind\u2014and\nthat this idea resembled Aristotle\u2019s notion of form and his\ndoctrine of hylomorphism. Philosophers following this line of thought\nincluded Fine (1999, 2010), Johnston (2006), Lowe (2011), Koslicki\n(2008), Rea (2011) and Jaworski (2011, 2012). It is difficult to\nprovide a compact account of these philosophers\u2019 positions, as\nit can seem that all they have in common is a belief in some form of\nrestricted composition and a sense that the Aristotelian label\n\u2019hylomorphism\u2019 helps to give their theories a pedigree. My\nstrategy here will be to illustrate modern hylomorphism mainly using\nthe examples of Jaworski and Johnston, then citing a major problem for\nany theory of this general kind, and illustrating this by reference to\nMarmodoro (2013), where good discussions of Lowe, Koslicki and Rea can\nbe found.\n\nIf there is a single notion that plays a role in the rationale of the\nrestriction of composition, it is probably structure. Jaworski\nprobably deploys this notion in the most straightforward way. He and\nRea both use the following illustration. If you compact a human being\nin a machine or waterproof bag, you retain the same matter, but lose\nthe human being, because you have destroyed the structure. Structure\nis, therefore, a real and essential element in many or most complex\nobjects. He explains his theory as follows. \n\n\nHylomorphism claims\u2026[t]hat structure is a basic ontological and\nexplanatory category. (2011: 169)\n\nStructure is also a basic explanatory principle in that it explains\nwhy members of this or that kind are able to engage in the behaviors\nthey do. It is because humans are organized as they are, for instance,\nthat they are able to speak, to learn, to engage in the range of\nactivities that distinguish them from other living things and from\nnon-living ones. (2011: 172)\n\n\nI think all the hylomorphists would agree with these statements, but\nthey each have their own way of stating the theory and it is not easy\nto fit them together. Johnston\u2019s central account is as follows.\n\n\n\nA statement of the genuine parts and principle of unity of an\nitem\u2026takes the following canonical form:\n\nWhat it is for\u2026(the item is specified here)\u2026to\nbe is for\u2026(some parts are specified here)...to have the\nproperty or stand in the relation\u2026(the principle of unity\nis specified here).\n\n\nAs in: What it is for this hydrochloric acid molecule to be\nis for this positive hydrogen ion and this negative chlorine ion\nto be bonded together. \u2026 The idea that each complex item\nwill have some such canonical statement true of it might be fairly\ncalled \u2018Hylomorphism\u2019. For it is the idea that each\ncomplex item admits of a real definition, or statement of its essence,\nin terms of its matter, understood as parts or components, and its\nform, understood as a principle of unity. (2006: 658)\n\n\nBut Johnston\u2019s notion of a \u2018principle of unity\u2019\nturns out to be so generous that his theory almost collapses into\nLewis\u2019s.\n\nConsider then all the myriad ways of constructing putative wholes from\nitems gravitationally related to other items. Are they all genuine\nwholes? Given Hylomorphism, there does not seem to be any happy way to\ninsist that they are not all wholes, even though very few of\nthem will be material objects or stable physical systems\u2026A\nwhole consisting of your eyeglasses and Pluto is too far from [normal\nphysical object] paradigms in respect of compactness and maximality to\ncount as a genuine whole in the ordinary sense. But it is fully,\ncompletely and genuinely true that it is a whole. (2006: 697)\n\n\nOne might wonder whether such an apparatus preserves what one might\nwant to save from a common-sense notion of composition.\n\nA general worry about the hylomorphist approach might be put as\nfollows. The modern hylomorphists do not claim to be interpreting\nAristotle, but to be inspired by his concept of form. This means that\nit is out of place simply to argue that they have not interpreted him\nin a scholarly fashion. Nevertheless, it is relevant to point it out\nif they have totally misunderstood his deployment of the concept of\nform, for if this is the case, it might suggest that they are\npretending to a solution to the composition problem that they do not\npossess. Someone who was sceptical about their claim to a solution\nmight start by pointing out that all the moderns reject the\n\u2019traditional\u2019 Aristotelian idea that form has a role as an\nefficient cause, actually making a difference to the way that its\nmatter behaves. They deny this because they all want their theories to\nbe consistent with the closure of the world under physics. At the same\ntime, they seem to intend their composites to have full ontological\nweight, and to have causal efficacy.\n\nJaworski is particularly clear in emphasising that he is a causal\npluralist and that the structural level is in no sense\nepiphenomenal or a mere logical construct out of the lower properties\n(see his 2011: 174). But one might query whether this is consistent\nwith accepting the possibility of closure under physics. Such closure\nnaturally raises the question of the causal claims made for form or\nstructure, and, hence, for their ontological weight. The importance of\nexplanations at the level of complex structures is not\ndisputed, but whether these represent just ways of\nconceptualising a fundamental level that we cannot normally\naccess, is another matter. Johnston raises this question (2006:\n660\u201362) but leaves it unresolved. Jaworski insists on causal\npluralism, but admits \u201call forces are operating at a fundamental\nphysical level\u201d: This latter remark seems to concede that what\none has in fact is an explanatory pluralism, with causation\nincluded in the domain of explanation, but all the brute force\nis confined to physics. Johnston is keen to deny that\nexplanation is a subjective or psychological phenomenon, but\nadmitting this does not place explanation in the world, in the sense\nin which the forces that actually make things happen are in the world:\nit only gives them the Platonic objectivity of propositions or\ntheories. \n\nIt seems that modern hylomorphism faces the following dilemma. The\nfollowing argument has appeal. \n\nThe concept of structure is essential to all or most natural\nsciences.\nIf something is essential to a valid mode of explanation or\nunderstanding, then it should be conceived realistically.\n\n\ntherefore\n\nThere are real structures in the world.\n\n\nBut the following also has appeal.\n\nIt is sufficient for the concept of structure to be applicable\nthat elements be appropriately arranged in the world, and these\narrangements can be characterised without employing the notion of\nstructure. This could be done by specifying the spatio-temporal\nlocation of the elements and their causal influence on each\nother.\n\n\nIf (4) is correct, it looks as if, though our structural concepts are\nwell grounded in reality, structures are not part of the basic\nfurniture of the world. This is, in fact, the same issue as whether\nKim\u2019s exclusion principle applies to the special sciences: that\nis, if physics gives a sufficient causal account of the location of\nall matter, are the other sciences merely heuristics, but strictly\nepiphenomenal? (see Kim 2005 and Robinson 2014). Perhaps the status of\nform and structure cannot be solved in a modern context without\nsolving the exclusion issue. \n\nAnna Marmodoro (2013) argues that the modern hylomorphists have\nmisunderstood Aristotle in a radical fashion, in a way that is\ndirectly connected with their concern about the unity and hence\nreality of composites. She claims, with strong backing from the text,\nthat form is not structure, because it is not a combination of parts.\nThe essence of form is its unity, and its unity depends essentially on\nthe fact that the matter that comes to compose it loses its previous\nidentity. By contrast, in any kind of structure of parts this identity\nis not lost; the parts are merely organised in a certain way.\n\nOn this interpretation, Aristotle must deny the core of (4), which is\nthat the behaviour of complexes derives necessarily from the primitive\ncausal powers of the elements and their spatial relations\u2014this\nis a \u2019bottom up\u2019 atomist principle., and presupposes that\nthe parts retain their identity within composites. But without this\ncore idea in (4), it is difficult to see how there can be\n\u2018closure under physics\u2019, for if the atoms did not retain\ntheir identity, how could the nomic structure that rests on them be\npreserved?\n\nThere seems to be, therefore, a tension between two principles the\nmodern hylomorphists seem to want to preserve. The tension is between\nthe role of form as the creator of a genuine, non-conventional unity\nin composites, and an openness to the modern belief in the closure of\nthe world under physics.\n\nMarmodoro\u2019s concern about Aristotelian unity also indicates a\ndifference between hylomorphism and the actual nature of substances,\nnamely concerning the vagueness that attaches to most of our substance\nconcepts. For most of our concepts, there are paradigm cases, but also\nmarginal cases. This is an almost inevitable consequence of taking\nseriously the atomic constitution of objects, for there will be no\nvery neat constraints on how they might combine. There are many\ntheories about how one should react to vagueness, but one of the most\ncommon and intuitive is to say that it is a conceptual\nmatter\u2014reality itself cannot be vague. This tends against a\nrealist and in favour of a conceptualist approach to our substance\nconcepts: if our macro\u2013substance concepts are prone to\nvagueness, and if vagueness is a sign that the concept in question is\nnot to be taken in a realist fashion, then Locke would be right that\nwhat we normally regard as substances are just our ways of classifying\nthings.\n\nThis conceptualist approach is reinforced if one accepts both what has\nbeen called the Eleatic Principle, namely that something can be a\nreal, concrete entity only if it has causal powers of its own, and,\nthat the physical world is \u201cclosed under physics\u201d. The\nlatter entails that only the entities of physics influence the\ndistribution and motion of matter, so that higher-order entities,\nthough they may figure in essential forms of explanation, have no\ninfluence on that on which everything physical supervenes. Applying\nthe Eleatic Principle to this, macro \u201centities\u201d are not\nreal in the way that anything worth calling hylomorphism, in the\nAristotelian tradition, requires (Robinson 2016: Part II).\n3.5 Substance and teleology\n\nThere is one mark of substance that was important to Aristotle that we\nhave not discussed. This is the connection between substance and\nteleology; that is, the notion that what something is is\nintimately connected with its natural purpose, end or function. The\nassociation with teleology does not naturally recommend itself to the\nmodern mind. Wiggins, for example, says that \u201cit would have been\nboth possible and advantageous for Aristotle to distance [his account\nof substance] from his concern with final causes\u2026\u201d (2001:\n80). The concern with teleology is presumably thought to be too\nclosely connected with Aristotle\u2019s theology, or the idea that it\nis divine design or intelligence that gives natural objects their\nends. Nevertheless, it is not easy for an Aristotelian to make a\ncomplete break from teleology. Teleology is what distinguishes living\nthings that act for purposes and have organs with functions from lumps\nand rocks, and it is the former that Aristotelians see as the paradigm\nsubstances. It is no accident, therefore, that artefacts, which are\ngenerally defined by their function, are often cited as good\nillustrations\u2014even if not paradigm cases\u2014of substances. So\nwe have a tension developing. On the one hand, lumps and rocks are\ngood paradigm cases of our notion of natural enduring objects. But\nthey are bad cases of objects with purposes or ends. Artefacts are\ngood cases of things with purposes, and are reasonably enduring, but\nare not natural objects. Living things come near to getting the best\nof both worlds. They are natural and enduring, and they have purposes,\nin the sense of natural goals in their behaviour. (Although, according\nto the modern perspective they do not possess a final end, unlike\nartefacts: a knife is for cutting, but there is nothing a dog is\nfor, though it has many ends en passant.)\n\nThis teleological approach to substance could be expressed as\nfollows.\n\nThe substances in a given system are those entities crucial from\nthe teleological or design perspective of that system.\n\u2018Crucial\u2019, here, means that other things exist either to\nconstitute them or to provide a context of operations for them.\n\n\nThe tension between the teleological mark of the substantial and the\nothers we have considered might make it useful to distinguish between\ndescriptive ontological priority and teleological\nontological priority. The former is interested in a purely\ndescriptive account of what exists, and it, therefore, rates as the\nsubstances those entities that a purely descriptive science would\ncount as basic. The latter, however, counts as substances those things\nthat are deemed fundamental because of the role or function they play\nin the world. This contrast is most plain in the case of artefacts. An\nartefact is made of its parts, and, in a sense, they are more basic\nthan it because they constitute it. But if there were not artefacts of\nthe appropriate kind, those parts would never have come into\nexistence: if there were no motor cars, there would be no steering\nwheels or accelerator pedals. Thus, like Aristotle\u2019s severed\nfinger (Metaphysics 1035b 23\u20135), these latter do not\ncount as substances. But it is not true that the parts would not exist\nwithout the whole if one takes parts right down to the\nnatural elements and atoms that make the artefact. Then one has a\nconflict about what is deemed basic between the descriptive and the\nteleological criteria. It is to avoid this conflict that Aristotle\nrejects atomism, by allowing that there are no true entities, only\nstuffs, more basic than those he wants to treat as substances by the\ncriteria of teleological significance. He avoids having to face the\nproblem that one set of things is basic or substantial descriptively,\nnamely the atoms from which everything is constituted, and another set\nof things\u2014the macroscopic objects of our ordinary\nlives\u2014are substances by the criterion of teleological\nimportance. Because matter is stuff, not individuals, the objects that\nare teleologically important are also the descriptively basic objects,\nbecause what they are made of are not objects at all.\n\nIt could be argued that atomism can be reconciled with treating the\nthings that are significant for us as substances only if one thinks of\nthe atoms as existing only in order to constitute such objects. This\nwould be so if God had created the atoms so as to construct\nmacroscopic objects from them, just as we create the parts of\nartefacts only for the sake of the artefacts. It might be argued that\nthe same objective could be reached without theism if there is\nirreducible teleology in nature that gives significance to the rest.\nThomas Nagel\u2019s view in his (2012) either adopts or comes close\nto this position. But Nagel\u2019s position seems to challenge\nnatural science within its own realm, whereas the \u201ctheological\nartefact\u201d model does not. It is uncontroversial that an\nartefact, such as a clock, can be both mechanical and defined as the\nkind of thing that it is by its function. Applying this model to\nnature as a whole would involve bringing theology into\nAristotle\u2019s metaphysics more directly than he, or indeed\nAquinas, intended. The notion that an object is what it is because of\nits use is found in Heidegger (1927 [2008]) but this is the use to\nwhich we put objects, not a divinely ordained teleology;\nHeidegger\u2019s theory imports the subjective perspective implicit\nin phenomenology, and this runs counter to Aristotle\u2019s\nobjectivism. If, however, one takes the teleology to be designed into\ncreation, this subjectivism is eliminated, and if one thinks that\nteleology is the key determinant of substantial identity, as with\nartefacts, then one has preserved the doctrine of substance, rather\nthan replacing it by a mere theory of function. This would have the\nconsequence that if the designer could change the purpose of an object\nwhilst leaving it physically unchanged\u2014as we do if we use a\nknife as a screwdriver\u2014then its substantial identity will change\n(Schillebeeckx, 1968, Dummett, 1987, Robinson, 2016)\n4. Conclusion\n\nAll non-relativist philosophical systems acknowledge substances in the\nmost generic sense of that term, for that is only to acknowledge that\nthere are some fundamental entities in their system. Most, if not all,\nphilosophers acknowledge that we cannot function without using\nsubstance concepts in the narrower sense, for the notion of an\nenduring particular or individual substance is essential to our making\nsense of the world as we live in it. But three things at least remain\ncontroversial. First, it is disputed what kinds of concepts need to be\ndeployed to characterise these enduring things: are they the rich\nvariety of traditional or \u2018Aristotelian\u2019 substance\nconcepts, or will various ways of identifying things simply as\nphysical bodies with certain characteristics do the job? Second, it is\nstill unclear how far our substance concepts purport to reflect a\ncomponent in reality (real or imagined) over and above the bundle of\nproperties that constitute its intelligible aspects. Third, the\nunclarity of the connection between what a thing is and\nwhat it does leaves unresolved the degree of interdependence\nbetween substance concepts and notions of purpose and final\ncausation.",
