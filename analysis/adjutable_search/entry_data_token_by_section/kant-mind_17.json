    "main_text": "Knowledge of the Mind\n6. Where Kant Has and Has Not Influenced Contemporary Cognitive Research\n\n\nWe will close by returning to the question of Kant\u2019s relationship to\ncontemporary cognitive research. As we saw, some of Kant\u2019s most\ncharacteristic doctrines about the mind are now built into the very\nfoundations of cognitive science. We laid out what they were.\nInterestingly, some of the others have played little or no role.\n\n\nConsider the two forms of Synthesis of Recognition in a Concept. In\nthe form of binding, the phenomenon that he had in mind in the first\nkind of synthesis is now widely studied. Indeed, one model, Anne\nTreisman\u2019s (1980) three-stage model, is very similar to all three\nstages of synthesis in Kant. According to Treisman and her colleagues,\nobject recognition proceeds in three stages: first feature detection,\nthen location of features on a map of locations, and then integration\nand identification of objects under concepts. This compares directly to\nKant\u2019s three-stage model of apprehension of features, association of\nfeatures (reproduction), and recognition of integrated groups of under\nconcepts (A98-A106). However, Kant\u2019s second kind of recognition under\nconcepts, the activity of tying multiple representations together into\na global representation (A107\u201314), has received little attention.\n\n\nThe same was true until recently of the\n unity of consciousness\n and Kant\u2019s work on it. However, this is changing. In the past twenty\nyears, the unity of consciousness has come back onto the research\nagenda and there are now hundreds of papers and a number of books on\nthe topic. However, claims such as Kant\u2019s that a certain form of\nsynthesis and certain links among the contents of experience are\nrequired for unity continue to be ignored in cognitive science, though\na few philosophers have done some work on them (Brook 2004). The same\nis true of Kant\u2019s views on consciousness of self; cognitive science\nhas paid no attention to non-ascriptive identification of self and the\nidea of the essential indexical. Here, too, a few philosophers have\nworked on these issues, apparently without knowing of Kant\u2019s\ncontribution (Brook & DeVidi, 2001), but not cognitive\nscientists.\n\n\nIn short, the dominant model of the mind in contemporary cognitive\nscience is Kantian, but some of his most distinctive contributions have\nnot been taken into it (Brook, 2004).\n",
