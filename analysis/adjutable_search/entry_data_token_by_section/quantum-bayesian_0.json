QBism is a form of Quantum Bayesianism\nthat may be traced back to a point of view on states and probabilities\nin quantum theory adopted by C.M. Caves, C.A. Fuchs, and R. Schack\n(2002). In its more recent incarnation (Fuchs, Mermin, & Schack\n2014) its proponents have adopted the name QBism for reasons discussed\nin\n \u00a71.1.\n In deference to its contemporary proponents, this shorter name is\nused. Fuchs, Mermin, and Schack 2014, and DeBrota and Stacey (2019,\n  Other Internet Resources)\n provide elementary introductions to QBism; Fuchs and Schack 2015, and\nFuchs and Stacey 2019 give more detailed summaries of the view; von\nBaeyer 2016 is a popular book-length introduction\n\nQBists maintain that rather than (either directly or indirectly)\nrepresenting a physical system, a quantum state represents the\nepistemic state of the one who assigns it concerning that\nagent\u2019s possible future experiences. It does this by specifying\nthe agent\u2019s coherent degree of belief (credence) in each of a\nvariety of alternative experiences that may result from a specific act\nthe agent may perform. To get an idea of the kinds of experience and\nact the QBist has in mind it is helpful to think of the possible\noutcomes of a quantum measurement on a physical system. But QBists\nhave proposed the extension of the view to encompass every\nexperience that may result from any action (Fuchs, Mermin,\nand Schack 2014; Mermin 2017).\n\nAs quantum theory is usually presented, the Born Rule provides an\nalgorithm for generating probabilities for alternative outcomes of a\nmeasurement of one or more observables on a quantum system. These\nprobabilities have traditionally been regarded as objective, in line\nwith the idea that the theory is irreducibly indeterministic.\n\nBy contrast, QBists hold a subjective Bayesian or personalist view of\nquantum probabilities (see entry on\n interpretations of probability).\n Taking a quantum state merely to provide input to the Born Rule\nspecifying these probabilities, they regard quantum state assignments\nas equally subjective. The quantum state assigned by an agent then\nprovides a convenient representation of an important part of his or\nher own overall state of belief. So quantum theory as a whole is\n\u201ca users\u2019 manual that any agent can pick up and use to\nhelp make wiser decisions in this world of inherent uncertainty\u201d\n(Fuchs 2010, 8,\n Other Internet Resources).\n\nQBists argue that from this point of view quantum theory faces no\nconceptual problems associated with measurement or non-locality. While\nQBism has implications for the nature of physical science, from this\npoint of view quantum theory has few if any direct\nimplications for the nature of physical reality.\n",
