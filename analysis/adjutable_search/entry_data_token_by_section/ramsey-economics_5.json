    "main_text": "The Problem of Optimum Saving || Re-normalizing Undiscounted Utilitarianism\n3.2 Re-normalizing Undiscounted Utilitarianism\n\n\nThe question arises whether there are circumstances in which there\nis a best consumption stream even though \\(V(0)\\) does not\nconverge for all consumption streams. Ramsey formulated the question by\naltering the way the saving problem is posed.\n\n\nImagine that well-being is bounded above no matter how large\nconsumption happens to be. Let \\(U\\) be the numerical measure of\nwell-being that DM chooses to work with. (All positive affine\ntransformations of \\(U\\) would be equally legitimate measures of\nwell-being.) Let \\(B\\) be the lowest upper bound of \\(U\\).  Ramsey\nchristened it \u201cBliss\u201d. Because the rate of return on\ninvestment \\((F_K)\\) in his model is positive, consumption would grow\nindefinitely and tend to infinity in the long run if saving rates were\nsuitably chosen. That means there are possible paths of economic\ndevelopment in which \\(U(C(t))\\) tend to \\(B\\) in the long run. But\nthat implies there are possible paths of economic development in which\nthe short-fall of \\(U(C(t))\\) from \\(B\\) tends to zero in the long\nrun. If the short-fall tends to zero fast enough, the undiscounted\nintegral of the difference between \\(U(C(t))\\) and \\(B\\) would exist,\nand DM could seek to maximize the modified integral. So we\nhave Ramsey Mark II, which reads as\n\n\n\u201cFrom the set of all feasible consumption streams, find that\n\\(\\{C(t)\\}\\) which maximizes\n\n\\[\nV(0) = \\int^{\\infty}_0 [U(C(t))-B]dt.\u201d\n\\]\n\n\n\nNotice that Mark II is a transformation of Mark I.\nThe transformation amounts to re-normalizing the optimality criterion.\nNot only was the move from Mark I to Mark II on\nRamsey\u2019s part ingenious, it also displayed his moral integrity. It\nwould have been easy enough for him to ask DM instead to discount\nfuture consumption and expand the range of circumstances in which\nUtilitarianism provides an answer to the problem DM is attempting to\nsolve. He chose not to do that.\n\n\nRamsey\u2019s intuition in moving from Mark I to Mark\nII was powerful, but in a paper that initiated the modern\nliterature on the Ramsey problem, Chakravarty (1962) observed that to\nrely exclusively on the condition Ramsey had identified as being\nnecessary for a consumption stream to be the optimum (see\nbelow) can lead to absurd results (see below, Sect. 4). In effect\nChakravarty observed that infinite integrals, even when cast in the\nre-normalized form in Ramsey Mark II, don\u2019t necessarily\nconverge to finite values.\n",
