    "main_text": "Moral Particularism and Justification\n5. Moral Particularism and Justification\n\nMoral particularists accept some disambiguation of at least one of the\nfollowing two theses:\n\n There exist no true moral principles.\n One should not use moral principles in the course of moral\ndeliberation.\n\n\nIf any version of the first thesis is true, then a fortiori\nthere is no a priori knowledge of any moral principle, since\nthere are no true moral principles. Moreover, particularists who\naccept the first thesis are distinct from Rossians in that they reject\nthe existence of true pro tanto moral principles such as that\npromise-keeping is a pro tanto duty. (Contemporary\nparticularists, and moral philosophers more generally, tend to prefer\n\u2018pro tanto\u2019 to Ross\u2019s \u2018prima\nfacie\u2019, which even Ross admitted was unsatisfactory\nimmediately upon introducing it. The problem with \u2018prima\nfacie\u2019 is that it means at first glance, but a\nprima facie duty is not something that seems to be a duty at\nfirst glance, but something that would be a duty if it is not\noverridden in some way. \u2018Pro tanto\u2019 means to\nthat extent, and a pro tanto duty is something that\nwould be a duty sans phrase, if it were not overridden in\nsome way.) Thus, particularists believe that one cannot know a\npriori any pro tanto principle. However, as we\u2019ll\nsee, these particularists nevertheless think one can attain knowledge,\neven a priori knowledge, of particular moral facts.\n\nMost particularists also accept the second thesis. In some cases,\nparticularists accept the second thesis because they accept the first\n(Dancy 2005, McDowell 1979). In other cases, particularists reject the\nfirst thesis but accept the second: they admit that there are some\ntrue moral principles, but hold that those principles are nevertheless\nnot the sorts of things that should play a role in\ndeliberation (Guarini 2006). However, all particularists who accept\nthe second thesis tend to adopt a similar moral\nepistemology\u2014let\u2019s call the second thesis\n\u201cabstinence\u201d.\n\nThere are other particularists who accept the first thesis and reject\nthe second, and admit that there are some false moral\nprinciples\u2014distinct from pro tanto moral\nprinciples\u2014that are appropriate to use in some deliberative\nsituations (Little 2000). Let\u2019s call this view \u201crule of\nthumb\u201d particularism.\n",
