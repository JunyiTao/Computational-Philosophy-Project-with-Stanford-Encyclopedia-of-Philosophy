    "main_text": "The Etymological Section (394e\u2013421c) || Application or Subversion?\n6.2 Application or Subversion?\n\nWhich conclusion(s) about the correctness of names might the\netymological section suggest? Here is one possible answer to this\nquestion. Socrates\u2019 etymological analyses indicate that the\netymological meanings of many Greek names mirror mistaken Heraclitean\nassumptions about the being of their referents. It follows that many\netymologically complex names fail to indicate the being of their\nreferents by describing it. If one does not want to assume that these\nnames are all incorrect, one is compelled to conclude that\netymologically complex names can be correct even if they encapsulate\ndescriptions that do not apply to the being of their referents. This\nconclusion is clearly incompatible with\n (NAT*)\u2014with\n the hypothesis, i.e., that a correct etymologically complex name for\na given kind needs to encapsulate a description of the way of being\nthat the members of this kind share. It is a very natural thought,\nthen, that the etymological section might be meant to discredit (NAT*)\nand the naturalist theory of which (NAT*) is part.\n\nThis elaboration of the idea that the etymological section makes a\npoint about the correctness of names appeals, unsurprisingly, to\nchampions of\n Reading A\n and\n Reading C.\n It is not the only possible elaboration of this idea, however. The\nalternative is to contend that Plato wants his readers to conclude\nthat many of the names under scrutiny are not correct. If one is\nwilling to commit oneself to this assumption, one is free to argue\nthat the etymological section does not discredit\n (NAT*),\n but applies this account of the correctness of names to assess the\ncorrectness of selected Greek names. On this interpretation, which\nobviously appeals to champions of\n Reading B,\n the etymological section relies on Socrates\u2019 naturalist theory\nof correctness to show that one should not place one\u2019s trust in\nthe correctness of actual Greek names.\n",
