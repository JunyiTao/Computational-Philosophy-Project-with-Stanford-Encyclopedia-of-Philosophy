    "main_text": "Randomness Without Chance || Chaotic Dynamics\n5.2 Chaotic Dynamics\n\n\nThe simple symbol shift dynamics in\n \u00a74.5\n had\na finite seed, which allowed for chance without randomness. Yet there\nseem to be physical situations in which a symbol shift dynamics is an\naccurate way of representing the physical processes at work. One simple\nexample might be a stretch and fold dynamics, of the kind common in\nchaos theory (Smith 1998: \u00a74.2). The classic example is the\nbaker\u2019s transformation (Earman 1986: 167\u20138; Ekeland\n1988: 50\u20139). We take a system the state of which at any one time\nis characterised by a point \\((p, q)\\) in the real unit\nsquare. We specify the evolution of this system over time as follows,\nletting \\(\\phi\\) be the function governing the discrete evolution\nof the system over time (i.e., \\(s_{t + 1} = \\phi(s_t))\\):\n\n\\[\n\\phi(p,q) =\n \\begin{cases}\n (2p, q/2), & \\text{if } 0 \\le p \\le \\frac{1}{2} \\\\\n (2p-1,(1+q)/2), & \\text{if } \\frac{1}{2} \\le p \\le 1\n \\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n\n\nThis corresponds to transforming the unit square to a rectangle\ntwice as wide and half the height, chopping off the right half, and\nstacking it back on top to fill the unit square again. (That this\ntransformation reminded mathematicians of baking says something about\ntheir unfamiliarity with the kitchen\u2014similar transformations,\nwhere the right half is \u2018folded\u2019 back on top, are more\nrealistic.) If we represent the coordinates \\(p\\) and \\(q\\)\nin binary, the transformation is this:\n\n\n\\[\n\\phi (0.p_1 p_2\\ldots, 0.q_1 q_2\\ldots) = (0.p_2 p_3\\ldots , 0.p_1 q_1 q_2\\ldots).\n\\]\n\n\nSo this is a slight variant on a simple symbol shift, as the\n\\(p\\)-coordinate is a symbol shift to the right, while the\n\\(q\\) coordinate is, in effect, a symbol shift to the\n left.[17]\n\n\nOne important feature of this dynamics is that it is measure\npreserving, so that if \\(X\\) is a subset of the unit square,\n\\(\\mu(X) = \\mu(\\phi(X))\\).\n(This is easily seen, as the symbol shift dynamics on the basic sets of\ninfinite binary sequences is measure-preserving, and each coordinate\ncan be represented as an infinite binary sequence.) Define the set\n\\(L = \\{(p, q) : 0 \\le p \\lt \\frac{1}{2} \\}\\).\nWe see that \\((p, q) \\in L\\) iff\n\\(p_1 = 0\\). Since \\(p\\) can be represented by an\ninfinite binary sequence, and a measure one set of finite binary\nsequences is Borel normal, we see that almost all states of this system\nare such that, over time, \\(\\mu(\\phi(s)\n\\in L \\mid s \\in L) = \\mu(\\phi(s) \\in L)\\)\u2014that\nis, whether the system is in \\(L\\) at \\(t\\) is\nprobabilistically independent of its past history. Furthermore,\n\\(\\mu(L) = \\mu(\\overline{L})\\). The behaviour of\nthis system over time, with respect to the partition \n\\(\\{L, \\overline{L}\\}\\), is therefore a\nBernoulli process, exactly like a sequence of fair coin tosses\u2014a\nseries of independent and identically distributed repetitions of a\nchance process. If the RCT is true, then a system which behaves exactly\nlike a chance process should have as its product a random sequence. So\nthe sequence of outcomes for the baker\u2019s transformation (under this\npartition) is a random sequence.\n\n\nBut unlike a sequence of fair coin tosses, supposing them to involve\ngenuine chance, the baker\u2019s transformation is entirely\ndeterministic. Given a particular point \\((p,\nq)\\) as an initial condition, the future evolution of states of\nthe system at each moment is time \\(t\\) is determined to be\n\\(\\phi^t (p, q)\\). So while\nthe product produced is random, as random as a genuine chance process,\nthese outcomes do not happen by chance; given the prior state of the\nsystem, the future evolution is not at all a matter of chance. So we\nhave a random sequence without chance outputs. (Indeed, given the\nsymbol shift dynamics, the evolution of the system over time in\n\\(\\{L, \\overline{L}\\}\\)\nsimply recapitulates successive digits of the starting point.) To be\nperfectly precise, the trial in this case is sampling the system at a\ngiven time point, and seeing which cell of the coarse grained partition\nit is in at each time. This is a sequence of arbitrarily repeated\ntrials which produces a random sequence; yet none of these outcomes\nhappens by\n chance.[18]\n To put the point slightly differently:\nwhile the sequence of outcomes is random, there is a perfectly adequate\ntheory of the system in question in which probability plays no role.\nAnd if probability plays no role, it is very difficult to see how\nchance could play a role, since there is no probability function which\nserves as norm for credences, governs possibility, or is non-trivial\nand shared between intrinsic duplicate trials. In short, no probability\nfunction that has the features required of chance plays a role in the\ndynamics of this system, and that seems strong reason for thinking\nthere is no chance in this system.\n\n\nThe baker\u2019s transformation provides a simple model of deterministic\nmacro-randomness\u2014a system which has a\n\\(\\mu\\)-measure-preserving temporal evolution, and produces a\nsequence of coarse grained states that have the Bernoulli property. It\nis a question of considerable interest whether there are physically\nmore realistic systems which exhibit the same features. We may conceive\nof an \\(n\\)-particle classical (Newtonian) system as having, at\neach moment, a state that is characterised by a single point in a\n\\(6n\\)-dimensional state space (each point a \\(6n\\)-tuple\ncharacterising the position and momentum of each particle). The\nevolution of the system over time is characterised by its\nHamiltonian, a representation of the energetic and other\nproperties of the system. The evolution under the Hamiltonian is\n\\(\\mu\\)-measure-preserving (by Liouville\u2019s theorem), so it might\nbe hoped that at least some systems could be shown to be Bernoulli too.\nYet for closed systems, in which energy is conserved over time, this is\nnot generally possible. Indeed, for closed systems it is not generally\npossible to satisfy even a very weak randomness property,\nergodicity. A system is ergodic just in case, in the limit,\nwith probability one, the amount of time a system spends in a given\nstate is equal to the (standard) measure of state space that\ncorresponds to that state (Earman 1986: 159\u201361; Sklar 1993:\n60\u20133; Albert 2000: 59\u201360). While a Bernoulli system is\nergodic, the converse entailment does not hold; if the system moves\nonly slowly from state to state, it may be ergodic while the state at\none time is strongly dependent on past history (Sklar 1993:\n166\u20137). While ergodicity has been shown to hold of at least one\nphysically interesting system (Yakov Sinai has shown that the motion of\nhard spheres in a box is ergodic, a result of great significance for\nthe statistical mechanics of ideal gases), a great many physically\ninteresting systems cannot be ergodic. This is the upshot of the\nso-called KAM theorem, which says that for almost all closed systems in\nwhich there are interactions between the constituent particles, there\nwill be stable subregions of the state space\u2014regions of positive\nmeasure such that if a system is started in such a region, it will\nalways stay in such a region (Sklar 1993: 169\u201394). Such systems\nobviously cannot be ergodic.\n\n\nThe upshot of this for our discussion may be stated: \u2018there are\nno physically realistic classical systems which exhibit even\nergodicity, and so no physically realistic classical system can\nexhibit randomness. The baker\u2019s transformation is a mathematical\ncuriosity, but is not a genuine case of randomness without chance,\nsince systems like it are not physically possible.\u2019 This\nresponse is premature. There are physically interesting systems to\nwhich the KAM theorem does not apply. Open or dissipative systems,\nthose which are not confined to a state space region of constant\nenergy, are one much studied class, because such systems are paradigms\nof chaotic systems. The hallmarks of a chaotic dissipative system are\ntwo (Smith 1998: \u00a71.5):\n\nThere exists at least one set of states in state space \\(A\\)\n(an attractor) such that when the system is started initially\nin its neighbourhood \\(N(A)\\), the trajectory of the\nsystem will in the limit end up in \\(A\\)  (\\(\\lim_{t \\rightarrow \\infty} \\phi^{t}N(A)\n\\subseteq A)\\); and\nThe system displays sensitive dependence on initial conditions:\nthat is, in some set of state space points that are all within some\narbitrary distance \\(\\delta\\) of each other, there are at least\ntwo points whose subsequent trajectories diverge by at least\n\\(\\varepsilon\\) after some time\n \\(t\\).[19]\n\n\nThere are physically realistic classical systems which exhibit both\nof these features, of which the best known is perhaps Lorenz\u2019s model of\natmospheric convection (Smith 1998: \u00a71.4; Earman 1986: 165). The\ncombination of these two features permits very interesting\nbehaviour\u2014while the existence of an attractor means that over\ntime the states of the system will converge to the region of the\nattractor, the sensitive dependence on initial conditions means that\nclose states, at any time, will end up arbitrarily far apart. For this\nto happen the attractor must have a very complex shape (it will be a\nregion of small measure, but most of the state space will be in the\nneighbourhood of the attractor). More importantly for our purposes, a\nsystem with these characteristics, supposing that the divergence under\nevolution of close states happens quickly enough, will yield behaviour\nclose to Bernoulli\u2014it will yield rapid mixing (Luzzatto\net al.\n 2005).[20]\n Roughly, a system is mixing iff the\npresence of the system in coarse state at one time is probabilistically\nindependent of its presence in another coarse state at another time,\nprovided there is a sufficient amount of time between the two\ntimes. This is weaker than Bernoulli (since the states of a\nBernoulli system are probabilistically independent if there is any time\nbetween them), but still strong enough to plausibly yield a random\nsequence of outcomes from a coarse grained partition of the state\nspace, sampled infrequently enough. So we do seem to have physically\nrealistic systems that yield random behaviour without chance. (See also\nthe systems discussed in Frigg 2004.)\n\n\nIndeed, the behaviour of a chaotic system will be intuitively random\nin other ways too. The sensitive dependence on initial conditions means\nthat, no matter how accurate our finite discrimination of the initial\nstate of a given chaotic system is, there will exist states\nindiscriminable from the initial state (and so consistent with our\nknowledge of the initial state), but which would diverge arbitrarily\nfar from the actual evolution of the system. No matter, then, how well\nwe know the initial condition (as long as we do not have infinite\npowers of discrimination), there is another state the system could be\nin for all we know that will evolve to a discriminably different future\ncondition. Since this divergence happens relatively quickly, the system\nis unable to be predicted. (Anecdotally, at least, Lorenz\u2019 model of the\nweather seems borne out by our inability to reliably predict future\nweather even a few days from now.) Insofar as randomness and lack of\nreliable prediction go hand in hand, we have another reason for\nthinking there is product randomness here\n (\u00a76.2).\n\n\nJust as before, the classical physical theory underlying the\ndynamics of these chaotic systems is one in which probability does not\nfeature. So we are able to give an adequate characterisation of the\nphysical situation without appeal to any probabilities fit to play the\nchance role. Given well-enough behaved boundary conditions, this system\nis also deterministic (though see\n \u00a75.3),\n and\nthat may also be thought to preclude a role for non-trivial chances. So\nagain we have randomness in the performance, though none of the\noutcomes happened by chance.\n\n\nTwo avenues of resistance to the line of thought in this section\nsuggest themselves. The first is to maintain that, despite the truth of\ndeterminism for the baker\u2019s transformation and classical physics\n(modulo worries to be addressed in the following section), there are\nstill, or at there least may be, non-trivial chances in these theories.\nThe proposal is that the possibility remains of deterministic\nchance, so that from the fact of determinism alone it does not\nfollow that we have a counterexample to RCT. The outcomes may be\ndetermined to happen by the prior conditions, but (so the suggestion\ngoes) they may still happen by chance. This radical proposal is\ndiscussed below, in\n \u00a77.\n It should be noted,\nhowever, that even if it is true that deterministic chance is possible,\nthat observation is far from establishing that the physical theories\nunder discussion here are ones in which deterministic chance features.\nThat some deterministic theories may have chances is no argument that\nall will, and particularly in very simple cases like the baker\u2019s\ntransformation, there doesn\u2019t seem much point in an invocation of\ndeterministic chance: chances will be trivial or redundant if classical\nphysics is true. The second avenue of resistance is to claim that there\nreally is chance here\u2014it is chance of the initial\nconditions which is recapitulated in the random sequence of\noutcomes. While the Lebesgue measure over the set of initial conditions\nin our models is formally like a probability function, to assume it\nyields genuine chances is a fairly controversial thesis (for a contrary\nopinion, see Clark 1987). Other initial conditions could have obtained;\nstill it seems wrong to think that (somehow) there was a chance process\nwhich terminated in the selection of the initial conditions which\nhappened in fact to obtain at our world. Rather, that the initial\nconditions are what they are seems to be a brute fact. If there are to\nbe chances, then, they cannot be dynamical chances, the kind that is\nfamiliar from physics, and from our discussion in\n \u00a71.2.\n Some recent arguments in favour of the possibility\nof chancy initial conditions are discussed in the following\nsupplementary document:\nSupplement D. Chance and Initial Conditions\n\n\nBut whether or not the idea of chancy initial conditions can be made\nto work, the fact remains that at most one outcome in the random\nsequence\u2014the first one\u2014happens by chance. The subsequent\nstates do not, yet RCT is committed to there being (dynamical,\ntransition) chances in those state transitions.\n",
