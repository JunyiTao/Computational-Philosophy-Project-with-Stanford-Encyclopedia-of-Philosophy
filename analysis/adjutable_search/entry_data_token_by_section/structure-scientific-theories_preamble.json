    "main_text": "\n\nScientific inquiry has led to immense explanatory and technological\nsuccesses, partly as a result of the pervasiveness of scientific\ntheories. Relativity theory, evolutionary theory, and plate tectonics\nwere, and continue to be, wildly successful families of theories\nwithin physics, biology, and geology. Other powerful theory clusters\ninhabit comparatively recent disciplines such as cognitive science,\nclimate science, molecular biology, microeconomics, and Geographic\nInformation Science (GIS). Effective scientific theories magnify\nunderstanding, help supply legitimate explanations, and assist in\nformulating predictions. Moving from their knowledge-producing\nrepresentational functions to their interventional roles (Hacking\n1983), theories are integral to building technologies used within\nconsumer, industrial, and scientific milieus.\n\nThis entry explores the structure of scientific theories from the\nperspective of the Syntactic, Semantic, and Pragmatic Views. Each of\nthese answers questions such as the following in unique ways. What is\nthe best characterization of the composition and function of\nscientific theory? How is theory linked with world? Which\nphilosophical tools can and should be employed in describing and\nreconstructing scientific theory? Is an understanding of practice and\napplication necessary for a comprehension of the core structure of a\nscientific theory? Finally, and most generally, how are these three\nviews ultimately related?\n",
