    "main_text": "Political Thought || Liberty and Pluralism\n5.2 Liberty and Pluralism\n\nIn Berlin\u2019s account, the main connection between pluralism and\nliberalism is the centrality of choice to both. His argument goes as\nfollows. The conflicts between values and ways of life that are the\nsubject matter of pluralism require people to make choices. These\nchoices are of the utmost importance, because they involve the most\nbasic and essential questions of human life \u2013 what one is to be\nand do. Those who have to make such choices are therefore likely to\ncare about them, and to want to be the ones to make them. Furthermore,\nthe freedom and ability to make one\u2019s own choices between\nconflicting values and possible lives is the crux of one\u2019s\nidentity as a moral agent. (This step of the argument, it should be\nnoticed, does not strictly follow from pluralism itself; but it is an\nassumption central to Berlin\u2019s moral individualism, which Berlin\nimports into his pluralism.)\n\nWhy might one deny individuals the opportunity to make choices for\nthemselves? One possible answer (though not the only one) is that\nindividuals may make the wrong choices, so that it is necessary to\ncoerce or manipulate them into choosing correctly. But pluralism holds\nthat, where there are conflicts between genuine values, there may be\nno single right choice \u2013 more than one choice may equally serve\ngenuine human values and interests, even if they also involve the\nsacrifice or violation of other values or interests that are neither\nmore nor less true and important. Similarly, there is no single ideal\nlife, no single model of how to think or behave or be, to which people\nshould attempt, or be brought, to conform. There are indeed chooseable\noptions that are beyond the pale from any humane viewpoint, because\nthey conflict with the \u2018core\u2019 of universally shared moral\nprinciples (see 4.4), and these may reasonably be blocked off. But the\nlimits of humanity should not be confused with the limits of a\nparticular perspective as against other reasonable possibilities that\nsatisfy the joint conditions of lying within the \u2018human\nhorizon\u2019 and not offending against the moral core.\n\nPluralism, then, for Berlin, both undermines one of the main\nrationales for violating freedom of choice, and corroborates the\nimportance and value of being able to make choices\n freely.[25]\n Some interpreters have argued that the high value that Berlin accords\nto the freedom to choose, while it rests in part on his pluralism,\nalso requires the addition of moral principles, ideals and assumptions\nexternal to pluralism (though this need not, contra John Gray, mean\nthat pluralism is incompatible with, or necessary undermines,\nliberalism). Others (such as George Crowder) have argued that\nBerlin\u2019s liberalism can be deduced from his pluralism alone,\nthough more recently Crowder has modified his view, now holding that\npluralism justifies liberalism only under the historical conditions of\nmodernity (2019, 105\u201312, 135\u20138, 221\u20132).\n\nAt the same time, while pluralism is a key ingredient in\nBerlin\u2019s argument for the importance of liberty, it also\nmodifies and moderates his liberalism, and prevents Berlin from being\n(as many proponents of negative liberty in the twentieth century and\nafter have been) a dogmatic, unqualified classical liberal or\nlibertarian. Negative and positive liberty are both genuine values\nwhich must be balanced against each other; and political liberty of\nany sort is one value among many, with which it may conflict, and\nagainst which it needs to be weighed. Berlin was more sensitive than\nmany classical liberal or libertarian thinkers to the fact that\ngenuine liberty may conflict with genuine equality, or justice, or\npublic order, or security, or efficiency, or happiness, and therefore\nmust be balanced against, and sometimes sacrificed in favour of, other\nvalues. Berlin\u2019s liberalism includes both a conservative or\npragmatic appreciation of the importance of maintaining a balance\nbetween different values, and a social-democratic appreciation of the\nneed to restrict liberty in some cases so as to promote equality and\njustice, and to protect the weak against victimisation by the strong\n(see 2002b, 214\u201315). Nevertheless Berlin remains a liberal in\nmaintaining that the preservation of a certain minimum of individual\nliberty is a political priority. He justifies this view by an appeal\nto an empiricist version of a natural law argument, writing of the\nexistence of \u2018natural rights\u2019 based on the way that human\nbeings are constituted, mentally or physically; to attempt to alter or\nlimit human life in certain ways is to block the desires, goals,\naspirations inherent in being human as we know it (1996, 90\u20132).\nTo deprive human beings of certain basic rights is to dehumanise them.\nWhile liberty should not be the only good pursued by society, and\nwhile it should not always trump other values, ethical pluralism lends\nit a special importance: for people must be free in order to allow for\nthe recognition and pursuit of all genuine human values. Society\nshould therefore make it a priority to provide the liberty necessary\nfor Millian \u2018experiments in living\u2019 and for the\nperpetuation of social and personal variety (see Berlin 2002b,\n218\u201351).\n",
