Perfect goodness as perfection in general versus perfect goodness as a specific perfection\n\nThere is a potential ambiguity in the expression \u2018perfect\ngoodness\u2019 that needs to be resolved. One might think that the\ninvestigation of the character of perfect goodness is nothing more or\nless than the investigation of the character of absolute perfection.\nOne might think, that is, that what one means when one applies the\nexpression \u2018perfectly good\u2019 to some being is the same as\nwhat one means when one applies the expression \u2018absolutely\nperfect\u2019 to some being; to say that a being is perfectly good is\njust to say that it instantiates perfectly those features that make a\nbeing intrinsically good. Here \u2018perfect goodness\u2019 just is\nperfection in general, and to call a being perfectly good is just to\nsay that it qualifies as an absolutely perfect being (Reichenbach\n1982, p. 138; Morris 1989d, p. 43; and Wierenga 1989, p. 202.)\n\u2018Perfect goodness\u2019 in that sense, though, is not what is\nunder investigation here; that sort of \u2018perfect goodness\u2019\nis the subject of perfect being theology generally. By contrast,\nsometimes the expression \u2018perfect goodness\u2019 is used to\npick out a particular perfection, a particular way in which a\nthing can be great, and to refer to the upper limit of greatness of\nthat sort. Thus we see that perfect goodness is often included in\nlists of the perfections exhibited by an absolutely perfect being:\nthat being would not only be omniscient and omnipotent, but would also\nbe perfectly good. \n\nWhat is this perfect goodness, a particular perfection exhibited by\nany absolutely perfect being? In recent work in philosophical theology\n\u2013 understandably, primarily in contexts in which the problem of\nevil is at issue \u2013 perfect goodness is understood as a\npractical excellence, an excellence concerned with desire,\ncharacter traits, and action. A perfectly good being has the best\ndesires that a being can have, and exhibits the best traits of\ncharacter, and acts in an unsurpassably excellent way. This practical\nexcellence is, furthermore, typically understood as moral\nexcellence (Morris 1989b, p. 26; Wierenga 1989, p. 202). So when one\nsays that any being who counts as God must be perfectly good, the\nclaim is that any such being would have desires and traits of\ncharacter and perform actions that are those of a being that exhibits\nmoral perfection. The idea, then, is this. We may call all of\nthese practically-oriented features of a being \u2013 that\nbeing\u2019s desires, character traits, actions, etc. \u2013 its\n\u2018agency\u2019. A being\u2019s agency might be morally better\nor morally worse. A morally perfect being, though, has morally\nunsurpassable agency. \n\nThe perfect being theologian who appeals to moral perfection as part\nof the nature of the absolutely perfect being inherits all of the\nuncertainty in metaethics about the proper formal characterization and\ndemarcation of the moral and all of the uncertainty in normative\nethics about the proper criteria for assessing moral goodness. In this\narticle we will not attempt a comprehensive account of such disputes,\nbut will simply take for granted a few widely-made assumptions. First,\nwe will assume that there are truths of the matter about the extent to\nwhich a being\u2019s agency exhibits moral goodness. Second, while\nthe considerations that are relevant in assessing moral goodness are\ndisputable, and it is even disputable whether the criteria for moral\ngoodness are relative to the kind of being in question, it seems clear\nthat the sort of moral goodness that is typically ascribed to the\nperfect being is moral goodness of a familiar, welfare-oriented kind.\nIn particular, it is assumed that morally good beings treat the\nwelfare of humans and at least some other sentient beings as\npractically relevant considerations, so that, other things equal,\nmorally good beings favor the promotion of well-being and disfavor\nsetbacks to it. So it is taken for granted that perfect moral goodness\ncannot involve opposition or indifference to the flourishing of\nsentient beings; the claim that perfect moral goodness might be so\ndifferent for God than for humans that God\u2019s perfect moral\ngoodness might involve God\u2019s being indifferent to the suffering\nof creatures would be taken as a rejection of the claim that God must\nbe perfectly morally good, not a gloss on it. As Mill writes,\n\nIf in ascribing goodness to God I do not mean what I mean by goodness;\nif I do not mean the goodness of which I have some knowledge, but an\nincomprehensible attribute of an incomprehensible substance, which for\naught I know may be a totally different quality from that which I love\nand venerate \u2026 what do I mean in calling it goodness? \u2026\nTo say that God\u2019s goodness may be different in kind from\nman\u2019s goodness, what is it but saying, with a slight change of\nphraseology, that God may possibly be not good? (Mill 1865, pp.\n42\u201343)\n\n",
