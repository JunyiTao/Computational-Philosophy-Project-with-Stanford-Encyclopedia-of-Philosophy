A famous example is the analysis of SAT\nscores\u2014the results of college admission tests\u2014in the\nUnited States as a function of the high school grade point average\n(GPA) of students. The data are given in\n Table 4:\n the overall SAT average rises from 1992 to 2002, but for each GPA\ngroup (A+/A/\u2026), SAT averages are falling. This phenomenon is,\nhowever, very natural. As soon as there is a bit of grade inflation at\nhigh schools, each group loses their best students to the next higher\ngroup, lowering the SAT average per group. But this is of course\nconsistent with the overall SAT average remaining equal, or even\nrising from 501 to 516, like in our dataset. A conclusion from the\nstratified data that \u201cstudents are getting more stupid\u201d\nwould be mistaken. Since societal developments such as grade inflation\naffect both the grade distribution and the SAT scores, one should\nnot condition on the GPA of a student when studying SAT\nscores over time (compare the back-door criterion from\n Section 3.4).[11]\n\n\n\nFigure 4: A linear regression model that\nillustrates Simpson\u2019s Paradox for bivariate cardinal data. Each\ncluster of values corresponds to a single person (repeated\nmeasurement).\n\n\nA similar example is presented in\n Figure 4,\n adapted from Kievit, Frankenhuis, Waldorp, and Borsboom (2013). The\nfigure shows the results of coffee intake on performance at an IQ test. Suppose\nthat coffee actually decreases performance slightly because it\nmakes drinkers more nervous and less focused. At the same time, coffee\nintake co-varies with education level (construction workers are too\nbusy for drinking coffee all the time!) and education level co-varies\nwith test performance. When we measure performance repeatedly for\ndifferent individuals, we see that their performance is slightly\nnegatively affected by their coffee intake. However, the\n(unconditional) regression model of performance as a function of\ncoffee intake suggests misleadingly\nthat coffee consumption strongly improves performance! The reason\nfor the confounding is the causal impact of the hidden covariate,\neducation level, on both coffee consumption and performance. Similar\nto the results from\n section 2,\n Simpson\u2019s Paradox in linear models can be characterized\nformally by means of inequalities among regression coefficients (e.g.,\nPearl 2013), and its occurrence depends on the nature of the causal\ninteraction between the involved variables.\n",
