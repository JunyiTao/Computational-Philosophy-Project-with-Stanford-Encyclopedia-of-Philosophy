One of the ubiquitous features of\nmodern biology that is prima facie incompatible with many\nmethodological and epistemological reductionist theses is the\nproliferation and flourishing of diverse biological subdisciplines,\nmolecular and otherwise. Despite the purported \u201chegemony of\nmolecular biology\u201d (Kitcher 1999a), biological subdisciplines\nfocused on higher levels of organization have not disappeared:\n\u201cSpecial sciences: still autonomous after all these years\u201d\n(Fodor 1997). For some time this feature of biological research, along\nwith many of the problems associated with theoretical reduction\n(especially its inapplicability to scientific practice, but also the\ndifficulties in identifying clear-cut and distinct\n\u201clevels\u201d to relate reductively; Brooks 2014, 2021, Brooks\net al. 2021, McGill and Potochnik 2012, Potochnik 2021), has prompted\nphilosophers to reject \u201creduction\u201d as the appropriate (or\nonly) relation among concepts and explanations from different\n domains.[15]\n Instead, relations of coordination driven by a commitment to\nunifying, integrating, or synthesizing aspects of scientific knowledge\nhave been offered (Bechtel and Hamilton 2007, Brigandt 2013b, Love\n2017, Potochnik 2011).\n\nLindley Darden and Nancy Maull were at the forefront of this\ndiscussion with the concept of an\n inter-field theory\n (Darden and Maull 1977, Maull 1977). For example, the advent of the\nchromosome theory of inheritance in the 1910s bridged the previously\nunrelated fields of Mendelian genetics (which studied phenotypic\npatterns of inheritance across generations) and cytology (which dealt\nwith the material contents of cells). This interfield theory effected\na kind of unification, but Mendelian genetics and cytology were not\nreduced to each other, nor did the interfield theory reduce both\nfields. More recent work has articulated interfield relations without\nrelying on the notion of a theory (Ankeny and Leonelli 2016, Bechtel\n1986, Burian 1993, Grantham 2004a, 2004b, Leonelli 2013, Mitchell\n2002). This parallels the trend in models of explanatory reduction of\nmoving away from theories as the only epistemic units of interest\n (Section 3.2),\n but the emphasis is on such relations as coordination, integration,\nsynthesis, or reciprocal interaction (Bechtel 2013, Green 2013,\nHochstein 2016, Love 2017, Nathan 2017, Plutynski 2013). A rationale\nfor these complex relations emerges from the demand for\nmultidisciplinary research (O\u2019Rourke et al. 2016); the\nexplanatory task involves coordinating diverse epistemic resources\n(Ankeny and Leonelli 2016), which amounts to an implicit rejection of\nthe \u201cfundamentality\u201d of one particular discipline\nproducing the most empirically adequate explanations.\n\nIn this context, Alan Love (2008a, 2014) uses the notion of a problem\nagenda to argue that some scientific problems not only motivate\ninterdisciplinary research but also provide structure for the\nrequisite intellectual coordination (see also Brigandt 2010, 2012,\nBrigandt and Love 2012, Villegas et al. 2023). Problem agendas consist\nof numerous component questions that stand in systematic relations and\nare tied to associated standards of explanatory adequacy. These\nstandards imply what epistemic resources and different disciplines are\nneeded to address the problem. The relations among component questions\nof the problem agenda (i.e., its internal structure) foreshadow how\nvarious contributions can be coordinated to generate an adequate\nexplanatory framework. Building on this perspective, Ingo Brigandt\n(2010) suggests that there is no single, linear hierarchy among\nscientific fields (e.g., Oppenheim and Putnam 1958), but that the\nrelationships among theories and disciplinary approaches are\ndetermined by and vary with the scientific problem being addressed.\nThese philosophical accounts align with general research on\ninterdisciplinarity, which has identified the presence and\narticulation of a complex question as a prerequisite (Repko 2008,\nSzostak 2002, 2009). Thus, instead of unification being a regulative\nideal with biologists seeking as much unity as possible in their\nexplanations of the complex natural world (e.g., Kitcher 1999b), an\nerotetic perspective suggests that particular problems determine the\nneed for and degree of any integration (Brigandt 2010). William\nBechtel\u2019s (1993, 2006) studies of cell biology document how the\nformation of new subdisciplines generates both integration among\napproaches and some disintegration due to new specializations.\nBechtel\u2019s attention to the institutional underpinnings of\nbiology also meshes with sociological analyses of disciplinary\norganization (Gerson 1998, 2013).\n\nRecently, accounts of explanation revolving around\n \u201cmechanisms\u201d\n have been widely discussed (e.g., Baetu 2015, Bechtel 2006, 2008,\nBechtel and Abrahamsen 2005, Craver 2006, 2007, Darden 2006, Glennan\n1996, 2017, Machamer et al. 2000). Many philosophers view experimental\nbiology as fundamentally concerned with the discovery of mechanisms\n(Craver and Darden 2013, Darden and Craver 2002, Tabery 2004), where\nmechanisms are understood as akin (though not equivalent) to machines\nwith interconnected, organized parts operating to produce regular or\nexpected outcomes. Conceiving of biological explanation in terms of\nmechanisms provides a philosophical framework that closely tracks\nbiological practice and does not rely on the notion of a theory.\nBesides providing new models for explanatory reduction\n (Section 3.2),\n mechanisms also have been used to demonstrate integration among\ndifferent fields. Darden (2005) argues that both reduction and\nreplacement fail to capture the relations between classical and\n molecular genetics.\n Both fields deal with different mechanisms that occur at different\nperiods of the cell cycle and involve different working entities:\nclassical genetics focuses on meiosis and involves chromosomal\nbehavior; molecular genetics focuses on gene expression and involves\nvarious molecular entities such as nucleotide sequences. Relations\nbetween the two fields are manifested as differential attention to\ndistinct aspects of a larger, temporally extended mechanism.\n\nThe mechanisms framework has proved particularly fruitful in capturing\nexplanations that appeal to entities at several levels of organization\n(Darden 2016, Tabery 2014). An instructive example is Carl\nCraver\u2019s (2005, 2007) discussion of multilevel and multifield\nexplanation in the context of neuroscientific studies of learning.\nWhile the cellular-molecular process of long-term potentiation is\ncritical for memory formation, it is not merely a molecular\ncounterpart of memory. Long-term potentiation is a lower-level\ncomponent of an overall, multilevel mechanism. Reductionist accounts\nhave neglected the phenomenon of disciplinary integration at the same\nlevel of structural organization and invested too heavily in finished\nreductive explanations, ignoring the dynamic changes in research\nstrategy that precede them (Craver 2005). In addition to searching for\nmolecular correlates of higher-level phenomena\n(\u201cdownward-looking\u201d episodes), there also have been\nattempts to understand the role of molecular mechanisms in complex\nhigher-level phenomena (\u201cupward-looking\u201d periods of\nresearch). Sometimes progress has been achieved independently of or by\nabandoning reduction as an explanatory goal. This need to change\nstrategies depending on the research context is ubiquitous in\nmechanistic research (Bechtel 2010), which serves as another reminder\nfor philosophers to attend to actual scientific practice. Even though\na mechanism is temporally extended, philosophical analyses of\nmechanisms may not capture all aspects of temporality (see\n Section 4.3).\n While discussions have focused on the representation of time relative\nto a mechanism (e.g., Bechtel 2006, Machamer et al. 2000), not all\naspects of the dynamics of biological systems are well represented as\nmechanisms involving entities and activities. Some might be better\nmodeled using equations (Bechtel 2012, Bechtel and Abrahamsen 2010,\n2011, Brigandt 2015, Weber 2008), and in other cases time might be\nrepresented independently of the mechanisms being\n investigated.[16]\n\nComplexity also has been a source for articulating non-reductionist\nepistemological accounts of biological reasoning (Wimsatt 1974, Hooker\n2011). Sandra Mitchell (2003, 2009) has argued that different forms of\nbiological complexity block standard reductionist perspectives.\nMultiple (idealized) causal models must be integrated from different\ndisciplinary approaches to adequately represent this complexity,\nincluding our uncertainty in predicting its behavior, which has\nimplications for any social policy derived from these models (see also\nMitchell 2008, 2020, Mitchell and Gronenborn 2017). She specifically\ndraws attention to the phenomenon of self-organization, which refers\nto how system behaviors or patterns emerge from non-specific\ninteractions among lower-level components (Camazine et al. 2001,\nKauffman 1993), such as the collective behavior of social insects.\n(Self-organizing phenomena are also relevant to reductionism in\nphysical science; see, e.g., Goldenfeld and Kadanoff 1999, Whitesides\nand Ismagilov 1999.) Although decomposing a system into parts is\nimportant for claims about self-organization, there is no localization\nof causal responsibility to individual components (Bechtel and\nRichardson 1993, ch. 9). Instead, the system behavior is a function of\ngeneric patterns of component interaction, which foregrounds how\ncomplexity emerges from dynamics rather than constitution (see\n Section 4.3).\n For example, gene networks and human social networks may exhibit\nisomorphic patterns of self-organization due to their interactive\nstructure, which is unrelated to whether genes or humans are the\ncomponents. Thus, self-organizing phenomena occupy an odd place in the\nreductionism discussion because even though components are used to\nexplain the behavior of the system, it is the nature of their\ninteractions (not their specific characteristics) that generate\npatterns of behavior. These patterns are often referred to as\n emergent properties\n of the system (see also Bishop et al. 2022, Grantham 2007, Mitchell\n2012).\n\nThe philosophical import of biological complexity is underscored by\nrecent trends in systems biology (Boogerd et al. 2007, Green 2015,\n2017, Green et al. 2015, Mazzocchi 2012, Noble 2006, O\u2019Malley\nand Soyer 2012). In addition to the mathematical modeling of\nsystem-wide behavior, systems biology has a wealth of data about\nvarious molecular components of cells stemming from functional\ngenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics methods.\nDownward looking strategies in systems biology attempt to analyze\nsystemic dynamics into different components, whereas upward looking\nstrategies aim to synthesize how the quantitative interactions among\nindividual molecules result in higher-level behavior (Green et al.\n2018, Krohs and Callebaut 2007). Despite the focus on molecular\ncomponents and their interactions, non-reductionist themes tied to\ncomplexity are motivated by non-linear interactions and feedback loops\nthat generate emergent behaviors, distributed control, and system\nrobustness (Brigandt 2015, Bruggeman et al. 2002, Westerhoff and Kell\n2007).\n\nAnother distinct strand of discussion about reductionism is found in\ncritical analyses of methodology and explanation from the perspective\nof\n feminist philosophy of science\n and studies of the\n social aspects of science\n (e.g., Fehr 2004, Longino 1990, 1996).\n Feminist philosophy of biology\n has related reductionism and pluralism to other philosophical,\nscientific, and social issues. One core idea in these discussions is\nthat forms of reductionism are involved in mutually reinforcing\nfeedback loops with other factors, such as socioeconomic status or\nexpectations about gender (Keller and Longino 1996, Levins and\nLewontin 1985). Thus, reductionism, whether ontological, epistemic, or\nmethodological, can be understood as the manifestation of more diverse\ncommitments (e.g., political ideology) than much of the philosophy of\nbiology literature on reductionism would suggest\u2014the history of\nbiology points in this direction as well (see, e.g., Allchin 2008).\nThis line of criticism also suggests that the interrelations between\nreductionism in biology and the social sciences should be treated more\nexplicitly. Elisabeth Lloyd (2002) has argued that medical research\nshould not be restricted simply to molecular biological investigation\nbecause higher levels of social organization that are culturally\nsanctioned have unrecognized causal effects on health. As the social\nsciences and medicine attempt to apply different life science\nreasoning strategies, similar philosophical issues predictably\ntransfer, but with the potential for more socially damaging\nconsequences (see, e.g., Richardson 2013, 2021).\n\nA shared feature of many alternatives to reductionism is an emphasis\non pluralist dimensions of epistemology in biology that situate\nmethodological or explanatory reduction as only one among many\ncomponents (Dupr\u00e9 1993, Kellert et al. 2006, Longino 2000,\n2002, 2013, Mitchell 2003, Muszynski and Malaterre 2021,\nO\u2019Malley 2013). In different ways, these positions stress how\nthe scientific investigation of biological phenomena demands diverse\nepistemic tools without a requirement to tie it all together into\nfundamental physics, macromolecular chemistry, or even\n molecular biology.\n Thus, ontological reduction becomes more or less unhinged from\nepistemological reduction because there is no need to demonstrate how\neach and every domain of scientific inquiry is anchored in physical\nstuff. Scientists are epistemologically profligate, even if they are\nlargely metaphysically frugal (see Dupr\u00e9 1993 and van Fraassen\n2002 for differing perspectives on science and metaphysics). The\nplurality of biological research motivates a philosophical\n pluralism\n about biology, both in terms of the many meanings available for\ndifferent methodological and epistemological types of reduction, and\nthe need to have multiple dimensions of reductionism in order to\nsecure empirical adequacy with respect to modeling biological\nphenomena (Grantham 1999, Kellert et al. 2006, Looren de Jong 2006,\nMorange 2006, Sullivan 2009, van der Steen 1999, Wylie 1999).\n\nIt is clear that these different kinds of \u201calternatives\u201d\nto reductionism successfully capture a number of features left\nuntreated or ignored by theory reduction. However, it is an open\nquestion whether they supplant discussions of reduction or bear some\ncomplex relation to them (Craver 2005). Reasons in favor of the latter\nposition include the continued use of \u201creductionist\u201d\nlanguage (for and against) in biological research, as well as the fact\nthat a near universal reason for rejecting reduction and choosing an\nalternative is the problematic nature of theory reduction,\nwhich only represents a small space of the philosophical\npossibilities. One interpretation of some alternatives to reduction is\nthat they are responding to the complexity of reduction that has\nbecome more apparent over the past two decades (e.g., seeing\nexplanations as inherently interlevel), and the fact that\nbiologists\u2019 use of the term \u201creductionism\u201d refers to\ndifferent specific commitments in different cases and research\ncontexts. Thus, for example, mechanisms approaches are another way to\ntreat the heterogeneity of explanation (including reductive and\nnon-reductive aspects), which was largely ignored in the literature on\ntheory reduction, which assumed that a few select examples from\nbiological research were representative. This heterogeneity is a\npervasive feature of the history of biology; philosophical\nalternatives to reduction are responding in part to long-standing\ncontroversies among life science investigators about the legitimacy of\nreductionist research strategies and modes of explanation (see\n Section 2).\n The compatibility or conflict among these various alternatives and\ndifferent accounts of explanation in biology is still being probed\n(e.g., Bechtel 2006, 40\u201344), but the traditional philosophical\nproject of articulating a single notion of reduction to capture most\nessential aspects of theory structure and explanation across biology\nis unlikely to succeed.\n",
