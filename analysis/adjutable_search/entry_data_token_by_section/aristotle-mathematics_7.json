A science of kinematics (geometry of moving\nmagnitudes) where all motion is uniform motions is more precise than a\nscience that includes non-uniform motions in addition, and a science of\nnon-moving magnitudes (geometry) is more precise than one with moving\nmagnitudes. However, one might infer that \u2018precision\u2019 here\nmeans nothing more than \u2018clarity\u2019 (or perhaps\n\u2018refinement\u2019, with all its ambiguity). Does this concept of\n\u2018precision\u2019 provide a framework for solving the problem of\nprecision?\n",
