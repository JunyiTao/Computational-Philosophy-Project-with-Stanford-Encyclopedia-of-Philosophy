    "main_text": "Metaphysics || Situations\n2.5 Situations\n\n\nThe most common way people think and write about implicit biases is\nas attributes of persons. Another possibility, though, is that\nimplicit biases are attributes of situations. Although\npsychologists have been debating person-based and situation-based\nexplanations throughout the history of implicit social cognition\nresearch (Payne & Gawronski 2010; Murphy & Walton 2013; Murphy\net al. 2018), the situationist approach has gained steam due to Payne\nand colleagues\u2019 (2017) \u201cbias of crowds\u201d model.\nBorrowing from the concept of the \u201cwisdom of crowds,\u201d this\napproach suggests that differences between situations explains the\nvariance of scores on implicit measures, rather than differences\nbetween individuals. A helpful metaphor used by Payne and colleagues is\ndoing \u201cthe wave\u201d at a baseball game. Where a person is\nsitting in the bleachers, in combination with where the wave is at a\ngiven time, is likely to outperform most individual differences (e.g.,\nimplicit or explicit feelings about the wave) in predicting whether a\nperson sits or stands. Likewise, what predicts implicit bias are\nfeatures of people\u2019s situations, not features of their\npersonality. For example, living in a highly residentially segregated\nneighborhood might be expected to outpredict racial implicit bias\ncompared to individual-level factors, such as beliefs and\npersonality.\n\n\nThe bias of crowds model is aimed at making sense of five features\nof implicit bias which are otherwise challenging to make sense of\ntogether, namely: (1) average group-level scores of implicit bias are\nvery robust and stable; (2) children\u2019s average scores of implicit\nbias are nearly identical to adults\u2019 average scores; (3)\naggregate levels of implicit bias at the population level (e.g.,\nregions, states, and countries) are both highly stable and strongly\nassociated with discriminatory outcomes and group-based disparities;\nyet, (4) individual differences in implicit bias have small-to-medium\nzero-order correlations with discriminatory behavior; and (5)\nindividual test-retest reliability is low over weeks and months. (See\nPayne et al. 2017 for references.) Another advantage of the bias of\ncrowds model is that it coalesces well with calls in philosophy for\nfocusing more on \u201cstructural\u201d or \u201csystemic\u201d\nbias, rather than on the biases in the heads of individuals\n(\u00a75).\n\n\nOne challenge for the bias of crowds model is explaining how\nsystemic biases interact with and affect the minds of individuals,\nhowever. Payne and colleagues appeal to the idea of the\n\u201caccessibility\u201d of concepts in individuals\u2019 minds,\nthat is, the \u201clikelihood that a thought, evaluation, stereotype,\ntrait, or other piece of information\u201d becomes activated and\npoised to influence behavior. The lion\u2019s share of evidence, they\nargue, suggests that the concepts related to implicit bias are\nactivated due to situational causes. This may be, but it does not\nexplain (a) how situations activate concepts in individuals\u2019\nminds (Payne and colleagues are explicitly agnostic about the format of\ncognitive representations that underlie implicit bias); and (b) how\nsituational factors interact with individual factors to give rise to\nbiased actions (Gawronski & Bodenhausen 2017; Brownstein et al.\n2019).\n",
