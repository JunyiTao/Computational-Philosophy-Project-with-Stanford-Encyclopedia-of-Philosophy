Philosophical views\n\n\nWhen trying to determine Proclus\u2019 profile as a philosopher, one has to\nkeep in mind that Platonists were not keen on introducing new elements\ninto the Platonic doctrine. They despised innovation\n(kainotomia). Yet it cannot be denied that Neoplatonic\nphilosophy differs considerably from what we read in Plato\u2019s\ndialogues. There is also overwhelming evidence for continual\ndiscussions in the school on the right interpretation of Plato or on\ncertain doctrinal points (such as the transcendence of the One, or the\nquestion whether the soul wholly descended from the intelligible\nworld). In order to evaluate Proclus\u2019 originality, one ought to\ncompare his views with those of the Neoplatonists before him, such as\nPlotinus, Porphyry, Iamblichus, and Syrianus. Only with regard to\nPlotinus is this possible to a great extent, because we still have the\nfull corpus of Plotinus\u2019 writings. Proclus certainly admired the first\n\u2018founder\u2019 of the new Platonism and even devoted a\ncommentary to the Enneads, of which, alas, we have only some\nfragments. He shared Plotinus\u2019 views on the three\nprincipal hypostases the One, the Intellect and the Soul, and\noften uses language inspired by his reading of Plotinus, as in his\ndescription of the union of the soul with the ineffable One. Yet on\nmany points, he is very critical of Plotinus, pointing to\ncontradictions, rejecting provocative views such as the thesis that\nOne is cause of itself (causa sui), the doctrine of the\nundescended soul, or the identification of evil with matter. Another\nradical difference from Plotinus (and Porphyry) is the importance\nattributed to theurgy for the salvation of the soul and the authority\nof Chaldaean Oracles.\n\n\nAs said before, it is very difficult to mark off Proclus\u2019\noriginality with regard to his teacher Syrianus, the only predecessor\nhe never criticizes. Of the literary production of the latter, we have\nonly his Commentary on Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics. It is\npossible that most of Syrianus\u2019 courses on Plato never were\npublished, but were continued and further worked out by\nProclus himself. We have, however, the commentary on the\nPhaedrus by Hermeias, who was sitting together with Proclus,\nin Syrianus\u2019 course. One gets the impression that Syrianus was\nvery interested in Orphic theogony, whereas for Proclus the\nChaldaean Oracles are more authoritative when\ndeveloping a Platonic theology. But here again, it is difficult to\ncompare as we do not possess Proclus\u2019 own commentary. Is Proclus\nafter all then not so original, but only an excellent teacher and\nwonderful systematizer of the new Platonic doctrines which became\ndominant in the school since Iamblichus on? We shall never know, and it\nis after all not so important when assessing the philosophical merits\nof his works. To praise Proclus\u2019 philosophical achievements,\nMarinus devotes in Life of Proclus one chapter to the\ndiscussion of the doctrines we owe to him (\u00a7 23). Surprisingly,\nfor all his admiration for the master, he can only enumerate a few\ninnovative doctrines; and they are of such a minor importance that we\nshall not even discuss them in this article.\n",
