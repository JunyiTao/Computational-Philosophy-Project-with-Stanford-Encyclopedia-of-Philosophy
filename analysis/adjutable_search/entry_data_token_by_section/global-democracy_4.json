    "main_text": "Models of Global Democracy || Intergovernmental Democratic States\n2.1 Intergovernmental Democratic States\n\n\nProponents of this model contend that world politics is democratic\nto the extent that each sovereign state is internally democratic with a\nfunctioning government and rule of law. Citizens thus have democratic\nrepresentation beyond the state through their national government. This\ntradition has been developed and continued by Immanuel Kant, Robert\nDahl, Ingeborg Maus, John Rawls, and many others. The crucial normative\nideal underpinning this model is liberal and cosmopolitan in\norientation: all individuals deserve an equal chance to participate in\nthe rule-making that governs their lives. This is necessary for\ncitizens to have liberty and self-determination. Unlike other\ncosmopolitans, though, these theorists argue that the nation-state\nplays a key normative and practical role in global democracy.\n\n\nBefitting a model that has a long history in democratic thought,\ndifferent institutional designs have been offered. In Perpetual\nPeace, for instance, Kant (1991 [1795]) argued for a global\nfederation of peoples composed of republican (i.e. democratic) states.\nIn this federation, states would observe a cosmopolitan right to\nhospitality, aid, and territory. John Rawls (1999) similarly advocated\nan international \u2018law of peoples\u2019 in which liberal\ndemocratic states (and decent states) establish international laws that\ngenerate a peaceful and tolerant international order. Some scholars in\nthis line, such as Robert Keohane, Andrew Moravcsik, and Stephen Macedo\n(2009), have gone even further and suggested that IOs can help keep\npeace between states (a core Kantian claim), and safeguard democracy,\ndeliberation, and human rights. Transnational activities are\ndemocratically legitimate from the perspective of citizens so long as\neach nation-state maintains autonomy and sovereignty in global affairs.\nThis allows supranational competences to be controlled and even revoked\nby member-states and their leaders (Z\u00fcrn 2000).\n\n\nAlthough this model has been prominent in the global democracy\nfield, it has several problems. First, only around 50 per cent of\nnation-states today are democratic. As such, much of the world\u2019s\npopulation is without democratic representation at either the national\nor transnational level. Second, nation-states do not have complete\ncontrol over international institutions. IR scholars increasingly note\nthat IOs, which are delegated authority from nation-states, suffer from\n\u2018agency slack\u2019. This means that actors within IOs\n(diplomats, bureaucrats, and so on) are able to carve out their own\nspace for action. This power cannot easily be controlled or recaptured\nby member-states. Finally, transnational networks and private forms of\ngovernance have proliferated beyond the state. These agents often have\nthe capacity to create global regulations which impact on domestic\ncitizens. Nation-states typically have no direct say in these bodies.\nAs such, the intergovernmental model provides many interesting\ninsights, but has failed to keep pace with empirical developments.\n",
