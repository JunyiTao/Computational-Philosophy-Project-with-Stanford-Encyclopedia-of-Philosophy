    "main_text": "The Topoi || The Word \u2018Topos\u2019 and the Technique of Places\n7.2 The Word \u2018Topos\u2019 and the Technique of Places\n\nThe word \u2018topos\u2019 (place, location) most probably\nis derived from an ancient method of memorizing a great number of\nitems on a list by associating them with successive places one is\nacquainted with, say the houses along a street. By recalling the\nhouses along the street we can also remember the associated items (on\nthis mnemonic technique see Sorabji 2004, 22\u201334). Full\ndescriptions of this technique from antiquity can be found in Cicero,\nDe Oratore II 86\u201388, 351\u2013360, Auctor ad\nHerennium III 16\u201324, 29\u201340 and in Quintilian,\nInstitutio XI 2, 11\u201333. In Topics\n163b28\u201332, Aristotle seems to allude to this technique:\n\u201cFor just as in the art of remembering, the mere mention of the\nplaces instantly makes us recall the things, so these will make us\nmore apt at deductions through looking to these defined premises in\norder of enumeration.\u201d Aristotle also alludes to this technique\nin On the soul 427b18\u201320, On Memory\n452a12\u201316, and On Dreams 458b20\u201322.\n\nBut although the name \u2018topos\u2019 may be derived from\nthis mnemotechnical context, Aristotle\u2019s use of topoi\ndoes not rely on the technique of places. At least within the system\nof the book Topics, every given problem must be analyzed in\nterms of certain linguistic, semantic or logical criteria: Does the\npredicate of the sentence in question ascribe a genus or a definition\nor peculiar or accidental properties to the subject? Does the sentence\nexpress a sort of opposition, either contradiction or contrariety,\netc.? Does the sentence express that something is more or less the\ncase? Does it maintain identity or diversity? Are the words used\nlinguistically derived from words that are part of an accepted\npremise? Depending on such criteria of the analyzed sentence one has\nto refer to a fitting topos. For this reason, the succession\nof topoi in the book Topics is organized in\naccordance with their salient linguistic, semantic or logical\ncriteria; above all topoi presented in Books II\u2013VII of\nthis treatise are structured in accordance with the four so-called\n\u2018predicables\u2019, i.e. whether a predicate signifies the\ngenus, an accident, a proprium (peculiar attribute) or the definition\nof the subject. This structure suggests that no additional\nmnemotechnique is essentially involved. Besides all this, there is at\nleast one passage in which the use of the word\n\u2018topos\u2019 can be explained without referring to the\npreviously mentioned mnemotechnique: In Topics VIII.1,\n155b4\u20135 Aristotle says: \u201cwe must find the location\n(topos) from which to attack\u201d, where the word\n\u2018topos\u2019 is obviously used to mean a starting\npoint for attacking the theses of the opponents.\n\nMore or less the same might apply to the\nRhetoric\u2014except that most of its lists of\ntopoi are structured by certain contents and not by\nlinguistic, semantic or logical criteria; moreover, the system of the\nfour \u2018predicables\u2019 that structured the topoi in\nthe Topics is absent from the Rhetoric (see below\n \u00a7 7.4).\n",
