    "main_text": "The Enlightenment Philosophes\n4. The Enlightenment Philosophes\n\nAfter Montesquieu, the other philosophers of the Enlightenment\nborrowed from the theories mentioned above to come up with their\ndescriptions of taste as a combination of three elements: sentiment,\nreason, and a knowledge of rules. Simultaneously, they distanced\nthemselves from both the refined world of salons that had promoted\ntheir careers and the academics who had developed theories of beauty.\nEven Montesquieu criticized salons as having a feminizing influence\nthat discouraged serious scholarship. Meanwhile, Voltaire describes\nscholars as myopic and dust-covered in his poem The Temple of\nTaste (1733). The majority of Enlightenment philosophers saw\nthemselves as erudite, serious thinkers who also lived in society. In\nterms of taste, they set themselves off as a caste of professional\ncritics who claimed the right to make artistic judgments that were\nmore authoritative than the potentially wayward preferences of the\ngeneral public.\n\nVoltaire describes good taste as a combination of sentiment and\nerudition. In his article \u201cTaste\u201d in the\nEncyclop\u00e9die, he gives the example of a young man who\ncries at a theatrical performance. Voltaire demands that this\nspontaneous reaction eventually be backed up by an understanding of\nthe reasons why the play had this effect on him\u2014namely, rules\nsuch as the Aristotelean unities. The experience is similar to that\ndescribed by Crousaz, except that the latter describes the ideal\nartistic reception as an immediate sentiment that is later confirmed\nby reason rather than rules. As for more extensive thoughts on beauty,\nhowever, Voltaire scholars affirm in their works devoted to his role\nas critic that he did not have an all-encompassing aesthetic theory.\nInstead, he made pronouncements on taste in the arts on a case-by-case\nbasis, with a clear preference for Greco-Roman conventions, but still\nwilling to make exceptions for certain passages by great writers who\nbroke these rules, such as Shakespeare.\n\nJean-Jacques Rousseau wrote little about taste and beauty, only\ndiatribes about the corrupting influence of the arts in general and a\nfew pieces about musical composition. It was Marmontel, his fellow\nphilosophe, who attempted to create a theory of taste\nextrapolated from Rousseau\u2019s philosophy. In his Essai sur le\ngo\u00fbt, which prefaces his \u00c9l\u00e9ments de\nlitt\u00e9rature (1787), Marmontel determines, like Batteux and\nmany others, that good taste is based on nature. He then recounts a\nseries of stages in which man passes from good taste to bad taste and\nthen back to good. First there are the \u201csavage men\u201d who\nexpress themselves with eloquence but no \u201cexcessive\nhyperbole\u201d or \u201csuperfluous epithet\u201d. In\nMarmontel\u2019s system, the second stage is that of the\n\u201cuncultured\u201d or \u201cbarbaric\u201d man, who prefers\nartificial and convoluted language. Alienated from nature, he has been\ncorrupted by luxury, vanity, and the whims of fashion. This bad taste\ncan be compared to Andr\u00e9\u2019s lowest type of taste, which he\ncalls arbitrary, because it is capricious and constantly changing.\nFinally, in Marmontel\u2019s model, the \u201ccivilized man\u201d\nemerges in the third stage, when he returns to a modified nature. This\ntrajectory is clearly based on Rousseau\u2019s schema, as he recounts\nit in his political works, of the noble savage who becomes corrupted\nby society, and who finally, in some unspecified future, will see\nsociety self-destruct and, in a way, come full circle to the beginning\nagain. Aside from these ideas, Marmontel\u2019s poetics were a return\nto a conventional system of classification of figures of style,\ncompatible with his contemporary Dumarsais\u2019 listing of\ntropes.\n\nDiderot\u2019s monumental article \u201cBeau\u201d of the\nEncyclop\u00e9die contains one of the best summaries of\nFrench aesthetic thought in the eighteenth century, as well as some\nnew ideas for artistic judgment. Early in the article, he exposes the\ncircular reasoning inherent to theories of beauty: according to Saint\nAugustine, unity is the defining characteristic of beauty\u2014a\nsymmetrical building would be an example. \u201cBut why is symmetry\nnecessary?\u201d asks Diderot, who answers himself, \u201cBecause it\npleases\u201d. \u201cWhy does it please?\u201d he continues,\n\u201cBecause it is beautiful\u201d. \u201cWhy is it beautiful?\nBecause it is unified\u201d. Unable to resolve this problem, he then\ngoes on to summarize the theories of beauty by Andr\u00e9 and\nCrousaz, as well as by Hutcheson and German philosopher Christian\nWolff. While Diderot claims to consider Andr\u00e9\u2019s treatise\nthe most profound and coherent, he still objects to the necessity of\ninnate ideas about what is beautiful. Instead, Diderot argues that all\nconceptions of symmetry, proportion, and beauty come from our\nobservations.\n\nHis own definition of taste depends on what he calls\n\u201crapports\u201d, or connections between various aspects of a\nwork. An artist creates these rapports and the most refined, the most\nerudite, and the most sensitive viewer is the one who can discern the\nlargest number of them. His prime example is a line from\nHorace, a 1640 tragedy by Corneille: \u201cqu\u2019il\nmour\u00fbt\u201d or \u201cthat he had died\u201d. Diderot\nexplains that these words in isolation are neither beautiful nor ugly.\nBut if one knows the context within the plot of the play, that this is\nthe answer that a father gives when asked what he would have his son\ndo in battle, the listener finds more interest in the line. Diderot\nadds several other circumstances from the play, for instance, that\nthis is the only surviving son, that he is alone against three\nenemies, and that he is fighting for the honor of his country, that\ncreate more rapports in the mind of the listener, until this\nultra-concise line becomes an object of great beauty. The rapports\ndescribed here involve understanding more and more of the plot and of\nthe human relationships depicted, which add layers of meaning to\ncertain lines. In his Lettre sur les sourds et muets,\ntranslated as Letter on the Deaf and Dumb (1751b), Diderot\nexplains something similar, using the term \u201chieroglyphics\u201d\nrather than \u201crapports\u201d. He gives the example of a poem in\nwhich men of taste can see a much larger number of\n\u201chieroglyphs\u201d or elements of prosody, than ordinary\npeople; in other words, they can do what literary scholars call a\nclose reading. What is not clear, however, is how people can reach the\nstage of refinement where they are able to discern more rapports or\n\u201chieroglyphs\u201d.\n",
