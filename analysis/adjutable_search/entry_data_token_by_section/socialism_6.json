    "main_text": "Socialist Institutional Designs (Dimension DII) || Central and Participatory Planning\n4.1 Central and Participatory Planning\n\nWould socialism do better than capitalism regarding the ideals of\nequality, democracy, individual freedom, self-realization, and\nsolidarity? This depends on the availability of workable versions of\nsocialism that fulfill these ideals (or do so at least to a greater\nextent than workable forms of capitalism). A first set of proposals\nenvision an economic system that does away with both private property\nin the means of production and with markets. The first version of this\nmodel is central planning. This can be understood within a\ntop-down, hierarchical model. A central authority gathers information\nabout the technical potential in the economy and about\nconsumers\u2019 needs and formulates a set of production objectives\nwhich seek an optimal match between the former and the latter. These\nobjectives are articulated into a plan that is passed down to\nintermediate agencies and eventually to local firms, which must\nproduce according to the plan handed down. If it works, this proposal\nwould secure the highest feasible levels of equal access to\nconsumption goods for everyone. However, critics have argued that the\nmodel faces serious feasibility hurdles (Corneo 2017: ch. 5: Roemer\n1994a: ch. 5). It is very hard for a central authority to gather the\nrelevant information from producers and consumers. Second, even if it\ncould gather enough information, the computation of an optimal plan\nwould require enormously complex calculations which may be beyond the\ncapacity of planners (even with access to the most sophisticated\ntechnological assistance). Finally, there may be significant incentive\ndeficits. For example, firms might tend to exaggerate the resources\nthey need to produce and mislead about how much they can produce.\nWithout facing strong sticks and carrots (such as the prospects for\neither bankruptcy and profit offered by a competitive market), firms\nmight well display low levels of innovation. As a result, a planned\neconomy would likely lag behind surrounding capitalist economies, and\ntheir members would tend to lose faith in it. High levels of\ncooperation (and willingness to innovate) could still exist if\nsufficiently many individuals in this society possessed a strong sense\nof duty. But critics find this unlikely to materialize, warning that\n\u201ca system that only works with exceptional individuals only\nworks in exceptional cases\u201d (Corneo 2017: 127).\n\nActual experiments in centrally planned economies have only partially\napproximated the best version of it. Thus, in addition to the problems\nmentioned above (which affect even that best version), they have\ndisplayed additional defects. For example, the system introduced in\nthe Soviet Union featured intense concentration of political and\neconomic power in the hands of an elite controlling a single party\nwhich, in turn, controlled a non-democratic state apparatus. Despite\nits successes in industrializing the country (making it capable of\nmobilizing in a war effort to defeat Nazi Germany), the model failed\nto generate sufficient technical innovation and intensive growth to\ndeliver differentiated consumer goods of the kind available within\nadvanced capitalist economies. Furthermore, it trampled upon civil and\npolitical liberties that many socialists would themselves hold\ndear.\n\nResponding to such widespread disempowerment, a second model for\nsocialist planning has recommended that planning be done in a\ndifferent, more democratic way. Thus, the participatory planning\n(or participatory economy, \u201cParecon\u201d) model proposes\nthe following institutional features (Albert 2003, 2016\n [OIR]).\n First, the means of production would be socially owned. Second,\nproduction would take place in firms controlled by workers (thus\nfostering democracy within the workplace). Third, balanced \u201cjob\ncomplexes\u201d are put in place in which workers can both engage in\nintellectual and manual labor (thus fostering and generalizing\nself-realization). Fourth, in a solidaristic fashion, remuneration of\nworkers would track their effort, sacrifice, and special needs (and\nnot their relative power or output\u2014which would likely reflect\ndifferences in native abilities for which they are not morally\nresponsible). Finally, and crucially, economic coordination would be\nbased on comprehensive participatory planning. This would involve a\ncomplex system of nested worker councils, consumer councils, and an\nIteration Facilitation Board. Various rounds of deliberation within,\nand between, worker and consumer councils, facilitated by this board,\nwould be undertaken until matches between supply and demands schedules\nare found\u2014with recourse to voting procedures only when no full\nagreement exists but several promising arrangements arise. This would\nturn the economy into an arena of deliberative democracy.\n\nThis proposal seems to cater for the full palette of socialist values\nstated in\n section 4.1.\n Importantly, it overcomes the deficits regarding freedom displayed by\ncentral planning. Critics have warned, however, that Parecon faces\nserious feasibility obstacles. In particular, the iterative planning\nconstituting the fifth institutional dimension of the Parecon proposal\nwould require immense information complexity (Wright 2010:\n260\u20135). It is unlikely that participants in the operations of\nthis board, even with the help of sophisticated computers, would\nmanage it sufficiently well to generate a production plan that\nsatisfactorily caters to the diversity of individuals\u2019 needs. A\ndefense of Parecon would retort that beyond initial stages, the\nprocess of economic decision-making would not be too cumbersome.\nFurthermore, it might turn out to involve no more paperwork and time\ndevoted to planning and to assessment behind computer terminals than\nis found in existing capitalist societies (with their myriad\nindividual and corporate budgeting exercises, and their various\naccounting and legal epicycles). And, in any case, even if it is more\ncumbersome and less efficient in terms of productivity, Parecon might\nstill be preferable overall as an economic system, given its superior\nperformance regarding the values of freedom, equality,\nself-realization, solidarity, and democracy (Arnold n.d.\n [OIR]:\n sect. 8.b).\n",
