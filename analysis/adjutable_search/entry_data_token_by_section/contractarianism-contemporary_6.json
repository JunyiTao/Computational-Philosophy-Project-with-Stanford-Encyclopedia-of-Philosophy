    "main_text": "Modeling Agreement || Consent\n3.1 Consent \n\nThe traditional social contract views of Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau\ncrucially relied on the idea of consent. For Locke only \u201cconsent\nof Free-men\u201d could make them members of the government (Locke\n1689, \u00a7117). In the hands of these theorists\u2014and in much\nordinary discourse\u2014the idea of \u201cconsent\u201d implies a\nnormative power to bind oneself. When one reaches \u201cthe age of\nconsent\u201d one is empowered to make certain sorts of binding\nagreements\u2014contracts. By putting consent at the center of their\ncontracts these early modern contract theorists (1) were clearly\nsupposing that individuals had basic normative powers over themselves\n(e.g. self-ownership) before they entered into the social contract (a\npoint that Hume (1748) stressed), and (2) brought the question of\npolitical obligation to the fore. If the parties have the power to\nbind themselves by exercising this normative power, then the upshot of\nthe social contract was obligation. As Hobbes (1651, 81 [chap\nxiv,\u00b67) insisted, covenants bind; that is why they are\n\u201cartificial chains\u201d (1651, 138 [chap. xxi, \u00b65).\n\nBoth of these considerations have come under attack in contemporary\nsocial contract theories, especially the second. According to\nBuchanan, the key development of recent social contract theory has\nbeen to distinguish the question of what generates political\nobligation (the key concern of the consent tradition in\nsocial contract thought) from the question of what constitutional\norders or social institutions are mutually beneficial and stable over\ntime (1965). The nature of a person\u2019s duty to abide by\nthe law or social rules is a matter of morality as it pertains to\nindividuals (Rawls 1999, 293ff), while the design and justification of\npolitical and social institutions is a question of public or social\nmorality. Thus, in Buchanan\u2019s view, a crucial feature of more\nrecent contractual thought has been to refocus political philosophy on\npublic or social morality rather than individual obligation. In most\nmodern social contract theories, including Rawls\u2019s, consent and\nobligation play almost no role whatsoever.\n\nAlthough contemporary social contract theorists still sometimes employ\nthe language of consent, the core idea of contemporary social contract\ntheory is agreement. \u201cSocial contract views work from\nthe intuitive idea of agreement\u201d (Freeman 2007a, 17). One can\nendorse or agree to a principle without that act of endorsement in any\nway binding one to obey. Social contract theorists as diverse as\nSamuel Freeman and Jan Narveson (1988, 148) see the act of agreement\nas indicating what reasons we have; agreement is a \u201ctest\u201d\nor a heuristic (see \u00a75). The \u201crole of unanimous collective\nagreement\u201d is in showing \u201cwhat we have reasons to do in\nour social and political relations\u201d (Freeman 2007, 19). Thus\nunderstood, the agreement is not itself a binding act\u2014it is not\na performative that somehow creates obligation\u2014but is\nreason-revealing (Lessnoff 1986). If individuals are rational, what\nthey agree to reflects the reasons they have. In contemporary contract\ntheories such as Rawls\u2019s, the problem of justification takes\ncenter stage. Rawls\u2019s revival of social contract theory in A\nTheory of Justice thus did not base obligations on consent,\nthough the apparatus of an \u201coriginal agreement\u201d persisted.\nRecall that for Rawls (1999, 16) the aim is to settle \u201cthe\nquestion of justification \u2026 by working out a problem of\ndeliberation.\u201d\n\nGiven that the problem of justification has taken center stage, the\nsecond aspect of contemporary social contract thinking appears to fall\ninto place: its reliance on models of counterfactual agreement. The\naim is to model the reasons of citizens, and so we ask what they would\nagree to under conditions in which their agreements would be expected\nto track their reasons. Contemporary contract theory is,\ncharacteristically, doubly counterfactual. Certainly, no\nprominent theorist thinks that questions of justification are settled\nby an actual survey of attitudes towards existing social arrangements,\nand are not settled until such a survey has been carried out. The\nquestion, then, is not \u201cAre these arrangements\npresently the object of an actual agreement among citizens?\u201d (If\nthis were the question, the answer would typically be\n\u201cNo\u201d.) The question, rather, is \u201cWould\nthese arrangements be the object of an agreement if citizens were\nsurveyed?\u201d Although both of the questions are, in some sense,\nsusceptible to an empirical reading, only the latter is in play in\npresent-day theorizing. The contract nowadays is always counterfactual\nin at least this first sense.\n\nThere is a reading of the (first-order) counterfactual question,\n\u201cWould R be the object of agreement if___\u201d which,\nas indicated, is still resolutely empirical in some sense. This is the\nreading where what is required of the theorist is that she try to\ndetermine what an actual survey of actual citizens would reveal about\ntheir actual attitudes towards their system of social arrangements.\n(This is seldom done, of course; the theorist does it in her\nimagination. See, though, Klosko 2000). But there is another\ninterpretation that is more widely accepted in the contemporary\ncontext. On this reading, the question is no longer a counterfactual\nquestion about actual reactions; it is, rather, a\ncounterfactual question about counterfactual\nreactions\u2014it is, as we have said, doubly\ncounterfactual. Framing the question is the first\ncounterfactual element: \u201cWould R be the object of\nagreement if they were surveyed?\u201d Framed by this\nquestion is the second counterfactual element, one which involves the\ncitizens, who are no longer treated empirically, i.e. taken as given,\nbut are, instead, themselves considered from a counterfactual point of\nview\u2014as they would be if (typically) they were better informed\nor more impartial, etc. The question for most contemporary contract\ntheorists, then, is, roughly: \u201cIf we surveyed the idealized\nsurrogates of the actual citizens in this polity, what social\narrangements would be the object of an agreement among\nthem?\u201d\n\nFamously, Ronald Dworkin (1975) has objected that a (doubly)\nhypothetical agreement cannot bind any actual person. For the\nhypothetical analysis to make sense, it must be shown that\nhypothetical persons in the contract can agree to endorse and comply\nwith some principle regulating social arrangements. Suppose that it\ncould be shown that your surrogate (a better informed, more impartial\nversion of you) would agree to a principle. What has that to do with\nyou? Where this second-stage hypothetical analysis is employed, it\nseems to be proposed that you can be bound by agreements that\nothers, different from you, would have made. While it might\n(though it needn\u2019t) be reasonable to suppose that you\ncan be bound by agreements that you would yourself have entered into\nif, given the opportunity, it seems crazy to think that you can be\nbound by agreements that, demonstrably, you wouldn\u2019t have made\neven if you had been asked.\n\nThis criticism is decisive, however, only if the hypothetical social\ncontract is supposed to invoke your normative power to self-bind via\nconsent. That your surrogate employs her power to self-bind would not\nmean that you had employed your power. Again, though, the power to\nobligate oneself is not typically invoked in the contemporary social\ncontract: the problem of deliberation is supposed to help us make\nheadway on the problem of justification. So the question for\ncontemporary hypothetical contract theories is whether the\nhypothetical agreement of your surrogate tracks your reasons to accept\nsocial arrangements, a very different issue (Stark 2000).\n\nThis argument has been revived by Jussi Suikkanen (2014) as the claim\nthat certain forms of contract theory, most notably Southwood\u2019s\n(2010) \u201cdeliberative\u201d contractualism, commit the\nconditional fallacy. The conditional fallacy is a specific version of\nthe problem we are considering here, namely that a conditional with\ncounterfactual agents, will not necessarily apply if the\ncounterfactual agents are sufficiently different from the real ones it\nis meant to apply to. In response, Southwood (2019) develops what he\ncalls an \u201cadvice model\u201d of contractualism wherein we take\nthe counterfactual contractors to generate reasons that should appeal\nto us as advice from a more thoughtful, idealized version of\nourselves, along lines similar to Michael Smith\u2019s (1994) ideal\nadvisor theory of moral reasons. Thrasher (2019) raises a different\nbut related concern that segmented choice in the model of agreement\ncan create outcomes that are not rationalizable to the parties, since\nthey are the result of path-dependent processes.\n\nAs we have argued, contemporary social contract theory rely on\nhypothetical or counterfactual agreement, rather than actual\nagreement. In one sense this is certainly the case. However, in many\nways the \u201chypothetical/actual\u201d divide is artificial: the\ncounterfactual agreement is meant to model, and provide the basis for,\nactual agreement. All models are counterfactual Understanding\ncontemporary social contract theory is best achieved, not through\ninsisting on the distinction between actual and hypothetical\ncontracts, but by grasping the interplay of the counterfactual and the\nactual in the model of agreement.\n\nRawls (1995) is especially clear on this point in his explication of\nhis model of agreement in response to Habermas. There he distinguishes\nbetween three different perspectives relevant to the assessment of the\nmodel (1996, 28):\n\nyou and me\nthe parties to the deliberative model\npersons in a well-ordered society\n\n\nThe agreement of the parties in the deliberative model is certainly\ncounterfactual in the two-fold sense we have analyzed: a\ncounterfactual agreement among counterfactual parties. But the point\nof the deliberative model is to help us (i.e., \u201cyou and\nme\u201d) solve our justificatory problem\u2014what social\narrangements we can all accept as \u201cfree persons who have no\nauthority over one another\u201d (Rawls 1958, 33). The parties\u2019\ndeliberations and the conditions under which they deliberate, then,\nmodel our actual convictions about justice and justification. As Rawls\nsays (1999, 514), the reasoning of the counterfactual parties matters\nto us because \u201cthe conditions embodied in the description of\nthis situation are ones that we do in fact accept.\u201d Unless the\ncounterfactual models the actual, the upshot of the agreement could\nnot provide us with reasons. Gaus describes this process as a\n\u201ctesting conception\u201d of the social contract (2011a, 425).\nWe use the counterfactual deliberative device of the contract to\n\u201ctest\u201d our social institutions. In this way, the\ncontemporary social contract is meant to be a model of the\njustificatory situation that all individuals face. The counterfactual\nand abstracted (see \u00a72) nature of the contract is needed to\nhighlight the relevant features of the parties to show what reasons\nthey have.\n\nSamuel Freeman has recently stressed the way in which focusing on the\nthird perspective\u2014of citizens in a well-ordered\nsociety\u2014also shows the importance of counterfactual agreement in\nRawls\u2019s contract theory. On Freeman\u2019s interpretation, the\nsocial contract must meet the condition of publicity. He\n(2007b:15) writes:\n\nRawls distinguishes three levels of publicity: first, the publicity of\nprinciples of justice; second, the publicity of the general beliefs in\nlight of which first principles of justice can be accepted\n(\u201cthat is, the theory of human nature and of social institutions\ngenerally)\u201d; and, third, the publicity of the complete\njustification of the public conception of justice as it would be on\nits own terms. All three levels, Rawls contends, are exemplified in a\nwell-ordered society. This is the \u201cfull publicity\u201d\ncondition.\n\n\nA justified contract must meet the full publicity condition: its\ncomplete justification must be capable of being actually accepted by\nmembers of a well-ordered society. The counterfactual agreement itself\nprovides only what Rawls (1996, 386) calls a \u201cpro\ntanto\u201d or \u201cso far as it goes\u201d justification of\nthe principles of justice. \u201cFull justification\u201d is\nachieved only when actual \u201cpeople endorse and will liberal\njustice for the particular (and often conflicting) reasons implicit in\nthe reasonable comprehensive doctrines they hold\u201d (Freeman\n2007b, 19). Thus understood, Rawls\u2019s concern with the stability\nof justice as fairness, which motivated the move to political\nliberalism, is itself a question of justification (Weithman, 2010).\nOnly if the principles of justice are stable in this way are they\nfully justified. Rawls\u2019s concern with stability and publicity is\nnot, however, idiosyncratic and is shared by all contemporary contract\ntheorists. It is significant that even theorists such as Buchanan\n(2000 [1975], 26\u201327), Gauthier (1986, 348), and Binmore (2005,\n5\u20137)\u2014who are so different from Rawls in other\nrespects\u2014share his concern with stability.\n",
