    "main_text": "Randomness\n2. Randomness\n\n\nAs mentioned in the introduction, some philosophers deliberately use\n\u2018random\u2019 to mean \u2018chancy\u2019. A random process, in\ntheir view, is one governed by chance in the sense of the previous\nsection. This generates stipulative definitions like this one:\n\n\nI group random with stochastic or chancy, taking a random process to\nbe one which does not operate wholly capriciously or haphazardly but\nin accord with stochastic or probabilistic laws. (Earman 1986:\n137)\n\n\nThis process conception of randomness is perfectly legitimate, if\nsomewhat redundant. But it is not adequate for our purposes. It makes the Commonplace Thesis a triviality, and thereby neither\ninteresting in itself nor apt to support the interesting conclusions\nsome have drawn from it concerning explanation or experimental\ndesign. Moreover, \n\n\nThe invocation of a notion of process randomness is inadequate in another way, as it does not cover all cases of randomness. Take a clear case of process randomness, such as one thousand consecutive tosses of a fair coin. We would expect, with very high confidence, to toss at least one head. But as that outcome has some chance of not coming to pass, it counts as process random even when it does. This is at variance with what we would ordinarily say about such an outcome, which is not at all unexpected, haphazard, or unpredictable. We could search for some refinement of the notion of process randomness that would reserve the word \u2018random\u2019 for more irregular looking outcomes. But a better approach, and the one we pursue in this entry, is to distinguish between randomness of the process generating an outcome (which we stipulate to amount to its being a chance process), and randomness of the product of that random process. In the case just envisaged, we have a random process, while the outomce \u2018at least one head in 1000 tosses\u2019 is not a random product. \n\nThe introduction of product randomness helps us make sense of some\nfamiliar uses of \u2018random\u2019 to characterise an entire\ncollection of outcomes of a given repeated process. This is the sense\nin which a random sample is random: it is an unbiased\nrepresentation of the population from which it is drawn\u2014and that\nis a property of the entire sample, not each individual member. If a random sample is to do its job, it should be irregular and haphazard with respect to the population variables of interest. We should not be able to predict the membership of the sample to any degree of reliability by making use of some other feature of individuals in the population. (So we should not be able to guess at the likely membership of a random sample by using some feature like \u2018is over 180cm tall\u2019.) A random sample is one that is representative in the sense of being typical of the underlying population from which it is drawn, which means in turn that\u2014in the ideal case\u2014it will exhibit no order or pattern that is not exemplified in that underlying population.\nWhile\nmany random samples will be drawn using a random process, they need not\nbe. For example, if we are antecedently convinced that the final digit\nof someone\u2019s minute of birth is not correlated with their family\nincome, we may draw a random sample of people\u2019s incomes by choosing\nthose whose birth minute ends in \u20187\u2019, and that process of\nchoice is not at all random. To be sure that our sample is random, we\nmay wish to use random numbers to decide whether to include a given\nindividual in the sample; to that end, large tables of random digits\nhave been produced, displaying no order or pattern (RAND Corporation\n1955). This other conception of randomness, as attaching primarily to\ncollections of outcomes, has been termed product\nrandomness.\n\n\nProduct randomness also plays an important role in scientific\ninference. Suppose we encounter a novel phenomenon, and attempt to give\na theory of it. All we have to begin with is the data concerning what\nhappened. If that data is highly regular and patterned, we may attempt\nto give a deterministic theory of the phenomenon. But if the data is\nirregular and disorderly\u2014random\u2014we may offer only a\nstochastic theory. As we cannot rely on knowing whether the phenomenon\nis chancy in advance of developing a theory of it, it is extremely\nimportant to be able to characterise whether the data is random or not\ndirectly, without detouring through prior knowledge of the process\nbehind it. We might think that we could simply do this by examination\nof the data\u2014surely the lack of pattern will be apparent to the\nobserver? (We may assume that patternlessness is good evidence for\nrandomness, even if not entailed by it.) Yet psychological research has\nrepeatedly shown that humans are poor at discerning patterns, seeing\nthem in completely random data, and (for precisely the same reason, in\nfact) failing to see them in non-random data (Gilovich et al.,\n1985; Kahneman and Tversky, 1972; Bar-Hillel and Wagenaar, 1991; Hahn\nand Warren, 2009). So the need for an objective account of randomness\nof a sequence of outcomes is necessary for reliable scientific\ninference.\n\n\nIt might seem initially that giving a rigorous characterisation of\ndisorder and patternlessness is a hopeless task, made even more difficult by the fact that we need to characterise it without using the notion of chance. (Otherwise we make CT trivial.) Yet a series of\nmathematical developments in the theory of algorithmic\nrandomness, culminating in the early 1970s, showed that a\nsatisfactory characterisation of randomness of a sequence of outcomes\nwas possible. This notion has shown its theoretical fruitfulness not\nonly in the foundations of statistics and scientific inference, but\nalso in connection with the development of information theory and\ncomplexity theory. The task of this section is to introduce the\nmathematical approach to the definition of random sequences, just as\nwe introduced the philosophical consensus on chance in the previous\nsection. We will then be in a position to evaluate the Commonplace\nThesis, when made precise using theoretically fruitful notions of chance and randomness.\n\n\nThe fascinating mathematics of algorithmic randomness are largely\nunknown to philosophers. For this reason, I will give a fairly detailed\nexposition in this entry. Various points of more technical interest\nhave been relegated to this supplementary document:\nSupplement B. Further Details Concerning Algorithmic Randomness\n\n\nMost proofs will be skipped, or relegated to this supplementary\ndocument:\nSupplement C. Proofs of Selected Theorems\n\n\nFuller discussions can be found in the cited references.\n\n\nThroughout the focus will be on a simple binary process, which has\nonly two types of outcome \\(O = \\{0,1\\}\\). (The theory of\nrandomness for the outcome sequences of such a simple process can be\nextended to more complicated sets of outcomes, but there is much of interest even in the question which binary sequences are product random?) A sequence of\noutcomes is an ordered collection of events, finite or infinite,\nsuch that each event is of a type in \\(O\\). So a sequence\n\\(x = x_1 x_2 \\ldots x_k\\ldots\\),\nwhere each \\(x_i \\in O\\). The set of all\ninfinite binary sequences of outcomes is known as the\nCantor space. One familiar example of a process the outcomes\nof which form a Cantor space is an infinite sequence of independent\nflips of a fair coin, where 1 denotes heads and 0 tails. Notions from\nmeasure theory and computability theory are used in the discussion\nbelow; an elementary presentation of the mathematics needed can be\nfound in supplement\n B.2.\n",
