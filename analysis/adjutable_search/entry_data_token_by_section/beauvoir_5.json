    "main_text": "America Day by Day: A Concrete Encounter\n6. America Day by Day: A Concrete Encounter\n\nIn January of 1947, Beauvoir traveled to America, landing at LaGuardia\nAirport in New York. The purpose of her trip, which was sponsored by\nthe French government, was to give lectures at colleges and\nuniversities on \u201cthe ethical problems of the post-war\nwriter\u201d. In the four months of her visit, she delivered twelve\nlectures, including those at Vassar, Oberlin, Mills College, and\nHarvard. Yet, her trip was also much more than a lecture tour.\nTraveling all over the country by car, train, and bus, Beauvoir\nvisited nineteen states and over fifty cities, furthered her\nfriendship with Richard Wright, fell in love with Nelson Algren, and\ndeveloped various political critiques of the United States. She\ndetails her visit in America Day by Day, a genre bending\ntravel-diary-essay, published in French in 1948. Although often cast\nas just a travel writing, it should not be overlooked as a political\nor philosophical text. Indeed, central to Beauvoir\u2019s concerns in\nAmerica Day by Day is how one\u2019s concrete situation is\nconstitutive of recognition and freedom. \n\nSimilar to her autobiographical writings, America Day by Day\nis a narrated record of Beauvoir\u2019s daily, concrete experiences.\nRather than advancing an argument, Beauvoir sets out to describe what\nshe did and what she perceived, while also at times offering critical\nviews of the social and political attitudes she encountered. For these\nreasons, this book is both a break from the general, abstract writing\nof her previous philosophical works, and generative of her more\nconcrete, politicized writings, thereby acting as a precursor to her\nconcrete analysis of women\u2019s situation (which she had already\nbegun prior to her visit to America), her account of China, and her\npersonal writings. It is only by being in the everydayness of America,\nbeing in its concrete proximity, that Beauvoir is able, perhaps\nwilling even, to offer an account of its problems.\n\nBeauvoir\u2019s account of America elucidates the dominant attitudes\nof bad faith in America. She writes about her observations of the\nexpressions of political apathy, anti-intellectualism, moral optimism,\nsocial conformism, and a capitalist-driven passivity among many\nAmericans, especially among the white, elite. She describes her\nconfrontations with segregation in the South, the violence of\nwhiteness in the North, and she notices the racism of white women and\nthe contradictions between America\u2019s commitment to democracy and\nits racism. Further, she accounts for class politics and labor\nrelations, America\u2019s foreign policy, and she reflects on the\nkinds of mystifications of ethics and politics in America that lead\nAmericans into bad faith.\n\nBeauvoir\u2019s attention to America\u2019s race relations and her\nconfrontation with her own whiteness during her visit have much to do\nwith Wright\u2019s influence on Beauvoir, whom she spent time with\nduring her long stay in New York, and her reading of Gunnar\nMyrdal\u2019s An American Dilemma (1944), which she often\nreferences. Yet, even as Beauvoir attends to race relations and white\npeople\u2019s racial hatred in America, scholars have pointed out\nthat there are also aspects of her account that expose\nBeauvoir\u2019s own white perception and colonizing encounters. This\ndimension of America Day by Day complicates but does not\nerase Beauvoir\u2019s political critique of America or the import of\nher description of the moral and political dispositions of Americans.\n\n",
