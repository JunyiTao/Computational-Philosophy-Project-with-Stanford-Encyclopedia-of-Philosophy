It yields two-boxing,\nwhereas one-boxing is correct. Terry Horgan (1981 [1985]), Paul\nHorwich (1987: Chap. 11), and Caspar Hare and Brian Hedden (2016) for\nexample, promote one-boxing. The main rationale for one-boxing is that\none-boxers fare better than do two-boxers. Causal decision theorists\nrespond that Newcomb\u2019s problem is an unusual case that rewards\nirrationality. One-boxing is irrational even if one-boxers\nprosper. Bales (2018) rejects the argument that two-boxing is\nirrational\n\nSome theorists hold that one-boxing is plainly rational if the\nprediction is completely reliable. They maintain that if the\nprediction is certainly accurate, then choice reduces to taking\n\\(\\$M\\) or taking \\(\\$T\\). This view oversimplifies. If an agent\none-boxes, then that act is certain to yield \\(\\$M\\). However, the\nagent still would have done better by taking both boxes. Dominance\nstill recommends two-boxing. Making the prediction certain to be\naccurate does not change the character of the problem. Efficacy still\ntrumps auspiciousness, as Howard Sobel (1994: Chap. 5) argues.\n\nA way of reconciling the two sides of the debate about Newcomb\u2019s\nproblem acknowledges that a rational person should prepare for the\nproblem by cultivating a disposition to one-box. Then whenever the\nproblem arises, the disposition will prompt a prediction of one-boxing\nand afterwards the act of one-boxing (still freely chosen). Causal\ndecision theory may acknowledge the value of this preparation. It may\nconclude that cultivating a disposition to one-box is rational\nalthough one-boxing itself is irrational. Hence, if in Newcomb\u2019s\nproblem an agent two-boxes, causal decision theory may concede that\nthe agent did not rationally prepare for the problem. It nonetheless\nmaintains that two-boxing itself is rational. Although two-boxing is\nnot the act of a maximally rational agent, it is rational given the\ncircumstances of Newcomb\u2019s problem.\n\nCausal decision theory may also explain that it advances a claim about\nthe evaluation of an act given the agent\u2019s circumstances in\nNewcomb\u2019s problem. It asserts two-boxing\u2019s conditional\nrationality. Conditional and nonconditional rationality treat mistakes\ndifferently. In contrast with conditional rationality, nonconditional\nrationality does not grant past mistakes. It evaluates an act taking\naccount of the influence of past mistakes. However, conditional\nrationality accepts present circumstances as they are and does not\ndiscredit an act because it stems from past mistakes. Causal decision\ntheory maintains that two-boxing is rational, granting the\nagent\u2019s circumstances and so ignoring any mistakes leading to\nthose circumstances, such as irrational preparation for\nNewcomb\u2019s problem.\n\nAnother objection to causal decision theory concedes that two-boxing\nis the rational choice in Newcomb\u2019s problem but rejects causal\nprinciples of choice that yield two-boxing. It seeks noncausal\nprinciples that yield two-boxing. Positivism is a source of aversion\nto decision principles incorporating causation. Some decision\ntheorists shun causation because no positivist account specifies its\nnature. Without a definition of causation in terms of observable\nphenomena, they prefer that decision theory avoid causation. Causal\ndecision theory\u2019s response to this objection is both to\ndiscredit positivism and also to clarify causation so that puzzles\nconcerning it no longer give decision theory any reason to avoid\nit.\n\nEvidential decision theory has weaker metaphysical assumptions than\nhas causal decision theory, even if causation has impeccable\nmetaphysical credentials. Some decision theorists do not omit\ncausation because of metaphysical scruples but for conceptual economy.\nJeffrey ([1965] 1983, 2004), for the sake of parsimony, formulates\ndecision principles that do not rely on causal relations.\n\nEllery Eells (1981, 1982) contends that evidential decision theory\nyields causal decision theory\u2019s recommendations but, more\neconomically, without reliance on causal apparatus. In particular,\nevidential decision theory yields two-boxing in Newcomb\u2019s\nproblem. An agent\u2019s reflection on his evidence makes conditional\nprobabilities support two-boxing.\n\nA noncontentious elaboration of Newcomb\u2019s problem posits that\nthe agent\u2019s choice and its prediction have a common cause. The\nagent\u2019s choice is evidence of the common cause and evidence of\nthe choice\u2019s prediction. Once an agent acquires the probability\nof the common cause, he may put aside the evidence his choice provides\nabout the prediction. That evidence is superfluous. Given the\nprobability of the common cause, the probability of a prediction of\none-boxing is constant with respect to his options. Similarly, the\nprobability of a prediction of two-boxing is constant with respect to\nhis options. Because the probability of a prediction is the same\nconditional on either option, the expected utility of two-boxing\nexceeds the expected utility of one-boxing according to evidential\ndecision theory. Horgan (1981 [1985]) and Huw Price (1986) make\nsimilar points.\n\nSuppose that an event \\(S\\) is a sign of a cause \\(C\\) that produces\nan effect \\(E\\). For the probability of \\(E\\), knowing whether \\(C\\)\nholds makes superfluous knowing whether \\(S\\) holds. Observation of\n\\(C\\) screens off the evidence that \\(S\\) provides for \\(E\\).\nThat is, \\(P(E\\mid C \\amp S) = P(E\\mid C)\\). In Newcomb\u2019s problem,\nassuming that the agent is rational, his beliefs and desires are a\ncommon cause of his choice and the prediction. So his choice is a sign\nof the prediction\u2019s content. For the probability of a prediction\nof one-boxing, knowing one\u2019s beliefs and desires makes\nsuperfluous knowing the choice that they yield. Knowledge of the\ncommon cause screens off evidence that the choice provides about the\nprediction. Hence, the probability of a prediction of one-boxing is\nconstant with respect to one\u2019s choice, and maximization of\nevidential expected-utility agrees with the principle of dominance.\nThis defense of evidential decision theory is called the tickle\ndefense because it assumes that an introspected condition screens off\nthe correlation between choice and prediction.\n\nEells\u2019s defense of evidential decision theory assumes that an\nagent chooses according to beliefs and desires and knows his beliefs\nand desires. Some agents may not choose this way and may not have this\nknowledge. Decision theory should prescribe a rational choice for such\nagents, and evidential decision theory may not do that correctly, as\nLewis (1981: 10\u201311) and John Pollock (2010) argue. Armendt\n(1988b: 326\u2013329) and David Papineau (2001: 252\u2013255) concur\nthat the phenomenon of screening off does not in all cases make\nevidential decision theory yield the results of causal decision\ntheory.\n\nHorwich (1987: Chap. 11) rejects Eells\u2019s argument because, even\nif an agent knows that her choice springs from her beliefs and\ndesires, she may be unaware of the mechanism by which her beliefs and\ndesires produce her choice. The agent may doubt that she chooses by\nmaximizing expected utility. Then in Newcomb\u2019s problem her\nchoice may offer relevant evidence about the prediction. Eells (1984a)\nconstructs a dynamic version of the tickle defense to meet this\nobjection. Sobel (1994: Chap. 2) discusses that version of the\ndefense. He argues that it does not yield evidential decision\ntheory\u2019s agreement with causal decision theory in all decision\nproblems in which an act furnishes evidence concerning the state of\nthe world. Moreover, it does not establish that an evidential theory\nof rational desire agrees with a causal theory of rational desire. He\nconcludes that even in cases where evidential decision theory yields\nthe right recommendation, it does not yield it for the right\nreasons.\n\nPrice (2012) proposes a blend of evidential and causal decision theory\nand motivates it with an analysis of cases in which an agent has\nforeknowledge of an event occurring by chance. Causal decision theory\non its own accommodates such cases, argues Bales (2016). \nAhmed (2014a) champions evidential decision theory and advances several\nobjections to causal decision theory. His objections assume some\ncontroversial points about rational choice, including a controversial\nprinciple for sequences of choices.\n\nA common view distinguishes principles for evaluating choices from\nprinciples for evaluating sequences of choices. The principle of\nutility maximization evaluates an agent\u2019s choice as a resolution\nof a decision problem only if the agent has direct control of each\noption in the decision problem, that is, only if the agent can at will\nimmediately adopt any option in the decision problem. The principle\ndoes not evaluate an agent\u2019s sequence of multiple choices\nbecause the agent does not have direct control of such a sequence. She\nrealizes a sequence of multiple choices only by making each choice in\nthe sequence at the time for it; she cannot at will immediately\nrealize the entire sequence. Rationality evaluates an option in an\nagent\u2019s direct control by comparing it with alternatives but\nevaluates a sequence in an agent\u2019s indirect control by\nevaluating the directly controlled options in the sequence; a sequence\nof choices is rational if the choices in the sequence are rational.\nAdopting this common method of evaluating sequences of choices fends\noff objections to causal decision theory that assume rival\nmethods.\n",
