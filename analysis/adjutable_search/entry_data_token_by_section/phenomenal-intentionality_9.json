    "main_text": "Arguments for PIT || The phenomenological case\n4.1 The phenomenological case\n\nHorgan and Tienson (2002) argue for the claim that \u201c[t]here is a\nkind of intentionality, pervasive in human mental life, that is\nconstitutively determined by phenomenology alone\u201d (2002: 520).\nThis is a (fairly strong) version of Weak PIT. They do so by arguing\nfor the following two principles:\n\n\nIOP:\n(The intentionality of phenomenology) Mental states of the sort\ncommonly cited as paradigmatically phenomenal (e.g.,\nsensory-experiential states such as color-experiences, itches, and\nsmells) have intentional content that is inseparable from their\nphenomenal character. (Horgan and Tienson, 2002: 520) \n\nPOI:\n(The phenomenology of intentionality) Mental states of the sort\ncommonly cited as paradigmatically intentional (e.g., cognitive states\nsuch as beliefs, and conative states such as desires), when conscious,\nhave phenomenal character that is inseparable from their intentional\ncontent. (Horgan and Tienson, 2002: 520)\n\n\nWe take IOP to say that each paradigmatic phenomenal property has an\nassociated intentional content such that, necessarily, all instances\nof the property have this associated content. We take POI to say that each\nparadigmatic intentional property has some associated phenomenal character such\nthat, necessarily, all instances of the property have this associated phenomenal\ncharacter.\n\nHorgan and Tienson defend IOP by appealing to broadly phenomenological\nconsiderations:\n\n\nYou might see, say, a red pen on a nearby table, and a chair with red\narms and back a bit behind the table. There is certainly something\nthat the red you see is like to you. But the red that you see is seen,\nfirst, as a property of objects. These objects are seen as located in\nspace relative to your center of visual awareness. And they are\nexperienced as part of a complete three-dimensional scene\u2014not\njust a pen with table and chair, but a pen, table, and chair in a room\nwith floor, walls, ceiling, and windows. This spatial character is\nbuilt into the phenomenology of the experience. (Horgan & Tienson\n2002: 521, footnote suppressed) \n\nThe basic idea is that introspective consideration of paradigmatic phenomenal states suggests that they are intentional. This argument echoes the transparency\nconsiderations for representationalism (see the entry Representational Theories of Consciousness).\n\nHorgan and Tienson\u2019s case for POI (the phenomenology of\nintentionality) rests primarily on detailed phenomenological\nobservations purporting to show that there are phenomenological\nfeatures corresponding to most contents of propositional attitudes as\nwell as the attitudes of belief and desires. We discuss these arguments\nin\n section 5.\n\nWith IOP and POI in hand, Horgan and Tienson proceed to argue for the\nwidespread existence of phenomenal intentionality. The following is a reconstruction of the key steps of their argument: \n\n The perceptual phenomenal states of a pair of\nphenomenal duplicates (creatures that have the same phenomenal experiences throughout their existence) necessarily share some contents, including many\nperceptual contents (from IOP).\nTherefore, the phenomenal duplicates necessarily have\nthe same perceptual beliefs.\nTherefore, the phenomenal duplicates necessarily share\nmany of their non-perceptual beliefs.\nTherefore, the phenomenal duplicates necessarily share\nmany of their intentional contents at the level of perception,\nperceptual beliefs, and non-perceptual beliefs.\n\n\nThe general idea is that phenomenal states, with their phenomenally\ndetermined intentionality, bring in their train much of the rest of\nthe \u201cweb of belief\u201d.\n\nHorgan and Tienson argue for the transition from\n (1)\n to\n (2)\n by articulating in some detail how the contents of perceptual\nexperiences, either individually or in groups, bring in their train\nperceptual beliefs. A key idea, supported by POI, is that perceptual\nbeliefs and other attitudes towards perceptible contents have\nphenomenal characters closely associated with them. For example, there\nis a phenomenology of accepting various contents as true. The\nsuggestion is that once one has a vast number of perceptual\nexperiences with their associated perceptual contents and feelings of\naccepting and rejecting some of these, one qualifies as having a number of perceptual beliefs.\n\nRegarding the transition from\n (2)\n to\n (3),\n a key idea, again derived from POI, is that non-perceptual beliefs\nhave extensive phenomenology. For example, according to Horgan and\nTienson, there is something that it\u2019s like to wonder whether to\ncook meatloaf for dinner. The phenomenology of such non-perceptual\nthoughts, together with one\u2019s vast collection of perceptual\nbeliefs and perceptual experiences, fixes a large number of\nnon-perceptual beliefs and other non-perceptual propositional\nattitudes.\n (4)\n combines conclusions\n (1)\u2013(3).\n\nThe following considerations, while not exactly Horgan and\nTienson\u2019s, seem to go in the same direction as their line of\nargument: If all beliefs and desires have phenomenal characters unique\nto them, as Horgan and Tienson take themselves to have established,\nthen phenomenal duplicates will share these phenomenal characters. By\nIOP, these phenomenal characters must determine contents. Plausibly,\nthey determine the contents of the beliefs and desires that they\ncharacterize. So if an individual has a given belief with content C,\nthen his or her phenomenal duplicate has this content as the content\nof a phenomenal experience. Moreover, the duplicate has a feeling of accepting\nC. It is then quite plausible that the duplicate believes\nC.\n\nHorgan and Tienson\u2019s argument establishes Weak PIT, but it does\nnot yet establish any version of Moderate PIT. It could be that many\nintentional states are phenomenal intentional states but some\nintentional states are neither phenomenal intentional states nor\ngrounded in phenomenal intentionality (Bailey and Richards (2014)\npoint out related limitations of the argument). However, when combined\nwith Horgan and Tienson\u2019s arguments for the claim that many\nnon-phenomenal intentional states are grounded in phenomenal\nintentionality (more on this view below), we have some support for\nModerate PIT. \nMendelovici (2018) also argues for Moderate PIT on the grounds of metaphysical sufficiency: The ingredients invoked by alternative theories of intentionality, such as tracking and functional role theories, are not metaphysically sufficient for intentionality. For instance, it is unclear why having internal states\nplaying certain functional roles should result in those internal states representing a particular content, or any content at all. Likewise, while tracking relations relate us to items that may seem to be well-suited to playing the role of content, such as objects, properties, and states of affairs, it is mysterious how tracking such items could make them psychologically relevant to us. For instance, it is unclear how merely tracking such items can make them introspectively accessible, available to reason with, or in any sense \u201centertained\u201d. (See also BonJour 1998 for similar worries with tracking and functional role theories.) In contrast, PIT\u2019s central ingredient, phenomenal consciousness, is arguably metaphysically sufficient for intentionality. For instance, it is arguably inconceivable for there to be someone with a reddish phenomenal experience who does not thereby represent redness. If all this is right, then there is reason to think that phenomenal consciousness alone is metaphysically sufficient for intentionality, which supports Moderate PIT.\n",
