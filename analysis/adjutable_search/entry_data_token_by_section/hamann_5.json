In a medieval morality or mystery play, the experience of\nbeing chaste or being lustful is transformed from a way of acting or\nfeeling into a dramatic character who then speaks and acts as a\npersonification of that quality. So too in philosophy, Hamann\nsuggests. The philosopher distinguishes differing aspects in the\nphenomenon under scrutiny and exaggerates their difference. These\naspects are ennobled into faculties, and through\n\u2018prosopopoeia\u2019 are hypostasized into entities. Thus in the\nact of reflecting on something, \u2018reasoning\u2019 is\ndistinguished from \u2018feeling\u2019, and turned from a verb or\ngerund into a noun \u2014 \u2018reason\u2019\u2014which is then\nnamed as a constituent of our being. Reason then becomes a thing to\nwhich we can ascribe properties. (This shows perhaps a streak\nbordering on nominalism in Hamann.)\n\nThe best example of this, and of Hamann\u2019s response, is his\ntreatment of the word \u2018reason\u2019. Since he handles it with a\nkind of skepticism or even distaste, he is often called an\n\u2018irrationalist\u2019. It is clear however that Hamann puts a\nhigh value on certain ways of being reasonable and of reasoning\nactivity. \u201cWithout language we would have no reason,\nwithout reason no religion, and without these three essential aspects\nof our nature, neither mind [Geist] nor bond of\nsociety\u201d (N III, 231, 10\u201312).\n\nHamann\u2019s treatment of reason instead is a deconstruction, both\nof the prosopopoeic use of the word and the Enlightenment valuation of\nit. There is no such thing as reason \u2014 there is only reasoning.\nReasoning, as something we do, is as fallible as we are, and as such\nis subject to our position in history, or own personality, or the\ncircumstances of the moment. \u2018It\u2019 is therefore not a\nuniversal, healthy and infallible \u2018faculty\u2019 as\nHamann\u2019s Enlightenment contemporaries often maintained:\n\nBeing, belief and reason are pure relations, which cannot be\ndealt with absolutely, and are not things but pure scholastic\nconcepts, signs for understanding, not for worshipping, aids\nto awaken our attention, not to fetter it.
