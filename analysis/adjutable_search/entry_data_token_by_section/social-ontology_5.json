    "main_text": "The Problem of Demarcating Social Ontology || Ontology Versus Causation\n2.2 Ontology Versus Causation\n\nA second difficulty in analyzing social entities is in distinguishing\nontological from merely causal relations. In many cases, the\ndistinction is straightforward. The Battle of the Somme, for instance,\nis part of World War I. That battle is not a cause of the war. It is a\nconstituent of it: the Battle of the Somme is ontologically rather\nthan causally related to World War I. The 1881 formation of the Triple\nAlliance, on the other hand, is causally related to the war, not\nontologically.\n\nMany cases, however, are less straightforward, and it is not always\neasy to distinguish when entities stand in ontological rather than\ncausal relations. We could argue that the formation of the Triple\nAlliance is only causally related to the war because it took place\nlong before the war began. But temporal remoteness is not always good\nevidence. Even if causes must always precede their effects,\nidentifying causally related events is complicated by the fact that\nevents extend over long periods of time. (The weather in January 1916\nis causally and not ontologically related to World War I, although the\nwar stretched on before and after that month.) Furthermore, there\nmight be instantaneous or even backward causation (see entry on\n backward causation).\n\nThe more significant complication, however, is that ontological\nrelations need not be synchronic. For a mental state to be a\nmemory, for instance, it must be caused by the event of which\nit is a memory. Likewise, a mark\u2019s being a footprint\npartly depends on historical events: it requires that the mark was\nmade by the strike of a foot (Dretske 1988, Stalnaker 1989). And for a\nperson to be President of the United States, an election must\nhave taken place beforehand. Some theories of the social world insist\nthat a social entity can only ontologically depend on synchronic facts\nabout the world. Classical structuralism, influenced by Saussure 1916,\nregards social structures as synchronic, with the social structure at\ntime t being a product of the mental states of individuals at\ntime t (see\n section 4.1).\n John Searle\u2019s theory of institutional facts (Searle 1995, 2010)\nalso regards social entities as being synchronically dependent: the\ninstitutional facts at time t are a product of attitudes in the\ncommunity at time t together with a synchronic residue of\nhistorical events that Searle calls the \u201cbackground\u201d. Work\nin a variety of domains, however, argues for an ontological role of\nhistorical factors. Among these are theories of semantic content\n(Kripke 1972, Putnam 1975, Davidson 1987), biological and social kinds\n(Millikan 1984), artworks (Levinson 1980), and artifacts (Bloom 1996,\nThomasson 2003).\n\nDistinguishing causation from ontology does not imply that causal\nrelations are ontologically irrelevant. Having causal effects may be a\ncriterion for an entity to be real (Gellner 1956, Bhaskar 1975, Elder-Vass\n2010). Causal structure is also often regarded as central to the\nnature of various entities. Several theorists argue that\nkinds are individuated by their causal roles (Fodor 1974,\nKhalidi forthcoming). Some theorists of biological and artifactual\nkinds regard patterns of reproduction to be part of what individuates\nthese kinds. And some theorists of human kinds regard certain causal\nfeedback loops to be characteristic of human kinds (see\n section 4.3.3).\n The burden of such accounts is to distinguish the causal factors that\nare part of an account of ontology from those that are\n\u201cmerely\u201d causally connected.\n\nFor more discussion of the distinction between \u201ccausal\u201d\nand \u201cconstitutive\u201d social construction, see Kukla 2000,\nHaslanger 2003. Discussion of non-causal determination relations can\nbe found in the recent literature on \u201cgrounding\u201d and\n\u201contological dependence\u201d, including Rosen 2010, Audi 2012, Correia & Schnieder 2012, Fine 2012, Raven 2015, the entry on metaphysical grounding, and the entry on ontological dependence.\n",
