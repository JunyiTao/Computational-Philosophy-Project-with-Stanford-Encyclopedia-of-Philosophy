Conclusion\n\nTo sum up, though this entry provides just an overview of the theory\nof the two truths in Indian Buddhism discussed overview, it\nnevertheless offers us enough reasons to believe that there is no\nsingle theory of the two truths in Indian Buddhism. As we\nhave seen there are many such competing theories, some of which are\nhighly complex and sophisticated. The essay clearly shows, however,\nthat except for the Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika\u2019s theory of the two truths,\nwhich unconditionally rejects all forms of foundationalism\nboth conventionally and ultimately, all other theories of the two\ntruths, while rejecting some forms of foundationalism, embrace another\nform of foundationalism. The S\u0101rvastiv\u0101din (or\nVaibh\u0101\u1e63ika) theory rejects the substance-metaphysics of the\nBrahmanical schools, yet it claims the irreducible spatial units\n(e.g., atoms of the material category) and irreducible temporal units\n(e.g., point-instant consciousnesses) of the five basic categories as\nultimate truths, which ground conventional truth, which is comprised\nof only reducible spatial wholes or temporal continua. Based on the\nsame metaphysical assumption and although with modified definitions,\nthe Sautr\u0101ntika argues that the unique particulars\n(svalak\u1e63a\u1e47a) which, they say, are ultimately causally\nefficient, are ultimately real; whereas the universals\n(s\u0101m\u0101\u1e45yalak\u1e63a\u1e47a) which are only\nconceptually constructed, are only conventionally real. Rejecting the\n\u0100bhidharmika realism, the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra proposes a form of\nidealism in which which it is argued that only mental impressions are\nconventionally real and nondual perfect nature is the ultimately real.\nThe Sv\u0101tantrika Madhyamaka, however, rejects both the\n\u0100bhidharmika realism and the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra idealism as\nphilosophically incoherent. It argues that things are only\nintrinsically real, conventionally, for this ensures their\ncausal efficiency, things do not need to be ultimately intrinsically\nreal. Therefore it proposes the theory which states that\nconventionally all phenomena are intrinsically real\n(svabh\u0101vata\u1e25) whereas ultimately all phenomena are\nintrinsically unreal (ni\u1e25svabh\u0101vata\u1e25). Finally, the\nPr\u0101sa\u1e45gika Madhyamaka rejects all the theories of the two\ntruths including the one advanced by its Madhyamaka counterpart,\nnamely, Sv\u0101tantrika, on the ground that all the theories are\nmetaphysically too stringent, and they do not provide the ontological\nmalleability necessary for the ontological identity of conventional\ntruth (dependent arising) and ultimate truth (emptiness). It therefore\nproposes the theory of the two truths in which the notion of intrinsic\nreality is categorically denied. It argues that only when conventional\ntruth and ultimate truth are both conventionally and\nultimately non-intrinsic, can they be causally effective.\n",
