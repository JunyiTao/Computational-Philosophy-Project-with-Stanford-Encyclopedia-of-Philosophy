    "main_text": "Association Theories || Gerard\n3.2 Alison\n\nArchibald Alison, whose Essays on the Nature and Principles of\nTaste first appeared in 1790, follows after Gerard in several\nrespects. He follows after Gerard in holding that objects of taste are\nnot naturally pleasurable, as Hutcheson had supposed, and so follows\nafter Gerard in holding that objects of taste must acquire their\npleasurability from something else that is naturally pleasurable. He\nfollows after Gerard, moreover, in holding that this acquisition\ndepends centrally on association, and follows after Gerard, finally,\nin holding that the naturally pleasurable something else is\u2014at\nleast typically and at least in part\u2014a mental operation of some\nsort. But he departs from Gerard regarding both the role of\nassociation and the identity of the naturally pleasurable mental\noperation. Whereas Gerard holds association merely to be a vehicle by\nwhich pleasurability is transmitted from the naturally pleasurable\nmental operation to the object of taste, Alison holds association also\nto be the central mental operation from which pleasurability is\ntransmitted to the object taste.\n\nThe process by which Alison takes the object of taste to acquire its\npleasurability is complicated. It begins with the object\u2019s\neliciting some simple emotion, such as, cheerfulness, tenderness,\nmelancholy, solemnity, elevation, terror, delicacy, grace, dignity, or\nmajesty (Alison 1811, 57\u201358, 66). This simple emotion then\nawakens a train of associated ideas such that each idea is emotionally\ncharged and each is united to each by a single associative principle,\nusually the principle of resemblance (Alison 1811, 53\u201357). The\nawakening of such a train of ideas is commonly known as \u201cthe\nseizing of the imagination\u201d and is naturally attended with a\nsimple pleasure (Alison 1811, 8, 103). This pleasure combines with the\npleasure attending the emotion that awakens the train, and with the\npleasures attending the emotions that arise from the ideas\nconstituting the train, to form the complex pleasures attending the\ncomplex emotions of taste, namely, the emotions of beauty and of\nsublimity. The claim that the pleasures of beauty and sublimity are in\nthis way complex is an important one, in that it obviates any need to\nposit a special internal sense by which the pleasures of taste\narise:\n\nThe pleasure \u2026 which accompanies the emotions of taste, may be\nconsidered not as a simple, but as a complex pleasure; and as arising\nnot from any separate and peculiar sense, but from the union of the\npleasure of SIMPLE EMOTION, with that which is annexed, by the\nconstitution of the human mind, to the exercise of IMAGINATION.\n(Alison 1811, 103)\n\n\nWhen the object of taste is a material object the process by which it\nbecomes pleasurable is more complicated still. The complication is\nthat material objects are not naturally productive of any emotion;\nthey are often naturally productive of simple pleasures and pains, but\nthese are sensations merely. Yet it cannot be doubted that material\nobjects often do produce the complex emotions of beauty and sublimity,\nand so must also produce the simple emotions that initiate unified\ntrains of ideas of emotion. Hence, material objects, in order to\nacquire the capacity to produce the complex pleasures of taste, must\nfirst acquire the capacity to produce simple emotions. They do so,\naccording to Alison, by coming to signify, through association,\nqualities of mind that are naturally productive of emotion (Alison\n1811, 105\u2013107). These include both active and passive qualities\nof mind,\n\n[both] its powers or capacities, as beneficence, wisdom, fortitude,\ninvention, fancy, &c. [and] its feelings and affections, as love,\njoy, hope, gratitude, purity, fidelity, innocence, &c. In the\nobservation or belief of these qualities of mind, we are formed, by\nthe original and moral constitution of our nature, to experience\nvarious and powerful emotions. (Alison 1811, 418)\n\n\nJust how material qualities come to be associated, and hence to\nsignify, such qualities of mind is a topic Alison considers in great\ndetail, devoting separate and sometimes lengthy chapters to the\nsublimity and beauty of sounds (Alison 1811, 113\u2013163), of colors\n(Alison 1811, 163\u2013176), of forms (Alison 1811, 176\u2013310),\nof motion (Alison 1811, 310\u2013315), and of the human countenance\nand form (Alison 1811, 315\u2013417).\n\nOf course the doctrine that the beauty of matter derives from the\nbeauty of mind is not new to Alison, who acknowledges a particular\ndebt to Reid:\n\nThe opinion I have now stated coincides, in a great degree, with a\nDOCTRINE that appears very early to have been distinguished the\nPLATONIC school; \u2026 which has been maintained in this country,\nby several writers of eminence\u2014by Lord Shaftesbury, Dr.\nHutcheson, Dr. Akenside, and Dr. Spence, but which has no where so\nfirmly and so philosophically been maintained as by Dr. Reid in his\ninvaluable work ON THE INTELLECTUAL POWERS OF MAN. The doctrine to\nwhich I allude, is, that matter is not beautiful in itself, but\nderives its beauty from the expression of MIND. (Alison 1811, 418)\n\n\nWhat is perhaps new, at least to eighteenth-century Britain, is\nAlison\u2019s thorough uncoupling of this Platonic doctrine from that\nof internal sense.\n\nAlison\u2019s theory of taste, perhaps more than any other here\nconsidered, is apt to strike the present-day aesthetician as alien to\nher concerns. But it is perhaps not so alien. Alison differs from his\npresent-day counterpart by defining the qualities she now terms\n\u201caesthetic\u201d according to the distinctive emotions he takes\neach to produce. Hence many of Alison\u2019s claims about the\nemotions of beauty and sublimity and about the simple emotions on\nwhich these depend can be translated into claims about aesthetic\nqualities. Consider, for example, the claim\u2014central and\ndistinctive to Alison\u2019s theory\u2014that the emotions of beauty\nand sublimity depend on simple emotions such as delicacy, grace,\ndignity, and majesty. Surely it is a precursor to present-day claims\nabout the dependence\u2014e.g., the supervenience\u2014of\ncomparatively evaluative aesthetic qualities on comparatively\ndescriptive aesthetic qualities.\n",
