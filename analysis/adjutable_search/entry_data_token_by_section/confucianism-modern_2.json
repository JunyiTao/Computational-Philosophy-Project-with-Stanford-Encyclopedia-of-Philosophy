Mou Zongsan put it this way: Western culture\nwas defined by the \u201canalytic spirit of the fulfillment of\nreason\u201d, by which he meant the tendency toward abstraction, the\nsearch for underlying concepts and general laws, and separating the\nsubject and object of investigation (MZCW 9b: 194\u201396). He also\ncalls the Western mode of thought \u201cthe constructive presentation\nof reason\u201d, because of its focus on constructing consistent\npractices, institutions, and structures (democratic bodies, scientific\ninstitutes) which are assessed on procedural grounds (following\ndemocratic practice or adhering to the scientific method and standards\nof evidence) rather than directly on whether their results are good\nfor the society (MZCW 10: 54\u201361). Chinese culture lacked this\nfocus on objectivity and structures, which impeded developing these\nmodern institutions.\n\nXu Fuguan analyzed Chinese and Western cultures in very similar ways.\nAlthough recognizing the vast gulf between ancient Greece and modern\nEurope and America, he saw the Greek focus on knowledge as the key\nfeature of the modern Western mind. Greek investigation took nature as\nits primary object, and in ancient Greek society,\n\n\nthey still felt the most capable, most useful, and most successful\nperson was the \u201cknower\u201d\u2026. For the Greeks, knowledge\nwas beauty and truth. (Xu 1952 [2022: 99])\n\n\nThe major difference between the ancients and moderns was that in\nGreece, the ancients pursued knowledge simply for education, while\n\n\nmoderns use it to pursue power. Francis Bacon said, \u201cKnowledge\nis power\u201d. This one sentence lays bare the spiritual core of\nmodern Western culture. (Xu 1952 [2022: 100])\n\n\nIn China, learning was not fundamentally about knowledge, but for the\npurpose of improving moral practice. Even moral philosophy was not\nabout perfecting moral theory, but realizing morality in one\u2019s\nactions (Xu 1952 [2022: 104]). With its focus on improving moral life,\nknowledge that did not have an obvious relation to moral practice was\nslighted and so the kind of value-neutral, disinterested investigation\nof nature that led to science did not develop in China.\n",
