Otherwise, they would face the charge of\narbitrariness or ad hocery in views about which categories\nthere are or where category differences lie. Yet there is little more\nagreement about the proper criteria for distinguishing categories than\nthere is about what categories there are.\n\nRyle famously considered absurdities to be the key to detecting\ncategory differences. But although Ryle made the method famous, he\napparently derived the idea from Husserl\u2019s method of\ndistinguishing categories of meaning (cf. Ryle 1970, 8; Simons 1995,\n120; Thomasson 2002, 124\u20138, and \u00a71.3 above). But while\nHusserl used syntactic nonsense as a way of detecting\ndifferences in categories of meaning (yielding different\ngrammatical categories), Ryle broadened the idea, taking\nabsurdities more widely conceived to be symptoms of\ndifferences in logical or conceptual categories\n(1938 [1971], 180). Thus, e.g., the statement \u201cShe came home in\na flood of tears and a sedan-chair\u201d (Ryle 1949, 22) is perfectly\nwell-formed syntactically, but nonetheless Ryle classifies it as a\nsentence that is absurd, where the absurdity is a symptom of the fact\nthat the sentence conjoins terms of different categories.\n\nIn his earlier paper \u201cCategories\u201d, Ryle describes the test\nfor category differences as follows: \u201cTwo proposition-factors\nare of different categories or types, if there are sentence-frames\nsuch that when the expressions for those factors are imported as\nalternative complements to the same gap-signs, the resultant sentences\nare significant in the one case and absurd in the other\u201d (1938\n[1971], 181) \u2013 in other words, two expressions (or rather: what\nthey signify) differ in category if there are contexts in which\nsubstituting one expression for the other results in absurdity. This\ntest, of course, provides no way of establishing that two expressions\nare of the same category (but only that they are not), since\nthere is an infinite number of sentence-frames, and one may always yet\nbe found that does not permit the substitution to be made without\nabsurdity. It also leaves open and merely intuitive the notion of\n\u2018absurdity\u2019 itself; in fact, Ryle concludes his paper\n\u201cCategories\u201d with the question \u201cBut what are the\ntests of absurdity?\u201d (1938 [1971], 184). Ryle\u2019s approach\nwas further developed, in a more formal fashion, by Fred Sommers\n(1959, 1971).\n\nJ. J. C. Smart (1953) criticized Ryle\u2019s criterion for drawing\ncategory distinctions on grounds that it could apparently be used to\nestablish a category difference between any two expressions\nwhatsoever. \u201cThus \u2018the seat of the \u2013 is hard\u2019\nworks if \u2018chair\u2019 or \u2018bench\u2019 is put into the\nblank, but not if \u2018table\u2019 or \u2018bed\u2019 is. And if\nfurniture words do not form a category, we may well ask what do\u201d\n(1953, 227). Without a test for absurdity apart from a certain kind of\nintuitive unacceptability to native speakers, we seem to be left\nwithout a means of declaring \u2018Saturday is in bed\u2019 to be a\ncategory violation but \u2018The seat of the bed is hard\u2019 not\nto be. Bernard Harrison attempts to meet this challenge by\ndistinguishing the sorts of inappropriateness that result from\nviolations of category facts (such as the former) from those that\nresult from mere violations of facts of usage (the latter) (1965,\n315\u201316). The use of the term \u2018bed\u2019 could conceivably\nbe extended in ways that would make \u2018The seat of the bed is\nhard\u2019 acceptable (e.g., if beds came to be made with seats),\nwhereas \u2018Saturday\u2019 could not conceivably be extended in a\nway that would make \u2018Saturday is in bed\u2019 acceptable\n\u2013 any such attempted \u2018extension\u2019 would just involve\nusing \u2018Saturday\u2019 homonymously (e.g., as the name for a day\nof the week and for a person) (1965, 316\u201318). For further\ndiscussion of intersubstitutability approaches to drawing category\ndistinctions, see Westerhoff (2005, 40\u201359 and 2002,\n338\u2013339). Westerhoff (2004) develops a method of distinguishing\ncategories based on substitutability in worldly states of affairs\nrather than language.\n",
