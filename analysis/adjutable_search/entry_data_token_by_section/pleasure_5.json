Philosophers have often aimed to\nrespect, more equally with pleasure\u2019s obscurely felt unity, also\nthe diversity manifest in its occasions. Thus Plato speculated that\npleasure is a sensing, perceiving, or awareness of improvement, in\nvarying respects, in one\u2019s condition; Aristotle, that it arises\nin the unimpeded functional fulfillment of varying life capacities in\ntheir characteristically different activities (e.g.; perceiving\nparticular things, theoretically contemplating their natures); and\ncontemporary writers that it is a welcoming attitude (had toward\ndifferent contents) or some underlying stance of openness to\nexperience generally that may waver between different objects and\nhaving none at all. Such questions have been explicitly contested at\nleast since Plato had his Socrates suggest that pleasure is so\nextremely heterogeneous that no simple generalizations about it will\nhold, such as the hedonist\u2019s claim that all pleasure is good,\nespecially given the very large differences between the things that\nvery different sorts of people enjoy (Philebus\n12C\u201313B).\n",
