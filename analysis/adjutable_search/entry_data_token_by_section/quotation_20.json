    "main_text": "Alternative Quotational Devices || Unambiguous Quotes\n7. Formal-Material Modes\n\nCarnap introduced in Logical Syntax of Language (1937) a\ndistinction between formal and material modes. The material mode is\ngenerally used to describe the non-linguistic world; the formal mode\nis generally used to discuss the language that is used to describe the\nmaterial world. Thus \u2018one is a number\u2019 is a sentence in\nmaterial mode; and \u2018\u2018one\u2019 is a number word\u2019 is\nits sentential counterpart in formal mode. This distinction is\nmentioned in passing here since some authors have thought it\ncorresponds to the use/mention distinction. Since the use/mention\ndistinction isn\u2019t particularly about quotation, there\nisn\u2019t much that needs to be said about the material/formal mode\nhere either. Revealing that a statement is basically about the use of\nlanguage may succeed in removing some of its metaphysical mystery. And\nit may even be that semantic ascent (that is, the device of making a\nsentence the topic, instead of what the sentence purports to refer to)\nsucceeds in demystifying much of what goes on in certain quarters of\nphilosophy. But as we\u2019ve said, this distinction, and the various\nphilosophical moves surrounding it, doesn\u2019t have much to do with\nquotation per se.\n",
