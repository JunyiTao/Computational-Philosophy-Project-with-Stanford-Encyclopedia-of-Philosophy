    "main_text": "Rights and Freedom\n4. Rights and Freedom\n\nMost rights entitle their holders to freedom in some sense; indeed\nholding a right can entail that one is free in one or more of a\nvariety of senses. In the most general terms, the active\nincidents\u2014the privilege and the power\u2014entitle their\nholders to freedom to act in certain ways. The passive\nincidents\u2014the claim and the immunity\u2014often entitle their\nholders to freedom from undesirable actions or states.\n\nWe can be more specific. A single privilege-right makes its holder\n\u201cfree to\u201d in the sense of non-forbiddenness. A spy with a\nsecurity clearance, for instance, may have a privilege-right that\nmeans she is free to enter a highly classified facility of her own\ngovernment. One can be free in this non-forbidden way without having\nthe physical ability to do what one is free to do. The spy, for\ninstance, still has \u201cno duty not\u201d to enter the classified\nfacility even when she is languishing in a distant foreign prison. The\nactions that one is free to do in this sense may or may not be\nphysically possible for one at the moment, but at least they are not\ndisallowed by the relevant norms.\n\nSomeone who has a pair of privilege rights\u2014no duty to perform\nthe action, no duty not to perform the action\u2014is free in an\nadditional sense of having discretion over whether to perform the\naction or not. For example, you may be free to join a protest march,\nor not, as you like. This dual non-forbiddenness again does not imply\nphysical ability. A rightholder may be permitted to perform or not\nperform some action, but this still does not mean that she is capable\nof performing the action that she is free to perform.\n\nIn contrast, the holder of a power-right does have an ability. This is\nthe normative ability to exercise authority in a certain way\n(Sumner 1987, 28). This normative ability confers freedom in a\ndifferent sense. A judge is free to sentence a convicted criminal to\nprison. The judge is not merely allowed to sentence the prisoner: her\npower-right gives her the ability\u2014that is, the\nauthority\u2014to do so. Her (power-) right makes her free to\nsentence in a way that non-judges are not free to sentence.\n\nAs for the passive rights, many claim-rights entitle their holders to\nbe free from the physical interference or surveillance of others.\nOther claim-rights entitle their holders to be free from undesirable\nconditions like hunger or fear. Immunity-rights parallel claim-rights\none level up. Immunity-rights make their holders free from the\nauthority of others, and so entitle their holders to be free from\nconditions like tyranny or exploitation.\n\nA legal system can be seen as a distribution of all of these varieties\nof freedom. Any legal system will set out rules specifying who is free\nto act in which ways, and who should be free from which unwanted\nactions and conditions. A developed legal system will also determine\nwho has the authority (and so who is free) to interpret and enforce\nthese rules.\n\nMore generally, any political constitution can be seen as a\nmulti-leveled structure of rights that distributes authority over\nrules of conduct in a distinctive way. A democratic constitution, for\nexample, may give voters the power to elect legislators, who have\ncertain powers to enact laws, which the judiciary has certain powers\nto interpret, and the police have certain powers to enforce, leaving\ncertain courses of conduct open as legal for citizens to pursue. The\nfacts about who should be free to do what within any legal or\npolitical system, as well as the facts about who should be free from\nwhich actions and conditions, can be represented as complex, layered\nstructures of rights\u2014exponentially more complex than in the\ndiagram of the property right above.\n",
