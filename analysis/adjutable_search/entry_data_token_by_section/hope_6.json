One can\nidentify two distinct approaches. On the one hand, there are authors\nlike Arthur Schopenhauer, Friedrich Nietzsche and Albert Camus who\nreject hope, not so much as epistemically irrational but as an\nexpression of a misguided relationship to the world that is unable to\nface the demands of human existence. On the other hand, authors like\nS\u00f8ren Kierkegaard and Gabriel Marcel take hope to be a means to\novercome the limitations of ordinary experience.\n\nKierkegaard examines hope primarily as it is connected to religious\nfaith. However, whereas Kant aims to show that our belief in God and\nhope for the highest good is possible within the limits of reason,\nKierkegaard is keen to emphasize that (eternal) hope must transcend\nall understanding. As an antidote to despair, hope plays a positive\nrole in Kierkegaard\u2019s work, culminating in his advice: \u201ca\nperson\u2019s whole life should be the time of hope!\u201d\n(Kierkegaard [1847] 1995: 251). In Works of Love, Kierkegaard\ndefines hope in its most general form as a relation to the possibility\nof the good: \u201cTo relate oneself expectantly to the possibility\nof the good is to hope\u201d (Kierkegaard [1847] 1995:\n249).\n\nMost interpreters of Kierkegaard emphasize a distinction between\n\u201cheavenly\u201d (or eternal) hope and \u201cearthly\u201d (or\ntemporal) hope (Bernier 2015; Fremstedal 2012; McDonald 2014). In some\npassages, Kierkegaard indeed seems to assume that there is also\n\u201cnatural hope\u201d (Kierkegaard [1851] 1990: 82) or hope\n\u201cfor some earthly advantage\u201d (Kierkegaard [1847] 1995:\n261). However, strictly speaking, Kierkegaard considers this the\n\u201cwrong language usage\u201d (Kierkegaard [1847] 1995: 261). He\ncompletes his definition as follows: \u201cTo relate oneself\nexpectantly to the possibility of the good is to hope, which\ncannot be any temporal expectancy but is an eternal hope\u201d\n(Kierkegaard [1847] 1995: 249). On Kierkegaard\u2019s view,\nhope\u2014strictly speaking\u2014is thus always directed towards the\neternal, \u201csince hope pertains to the possibility of the good,\nand thereby to the eternal\u201d (Kierkegaard [1847] 1995: 249). This\nis connected to Kierkegaard\u2019s account of time. Hope, as a form\nof expectation, is an attitude towards the possible. While\nexpectation, generally speaking, relates to the possibility of both\ngood and evil (Kierkegaard [1847] 1995: 249), hope relates only to the\npossibility of good. The possibility of the good, on\nKierkegaard\u2019s account, is a feature of the eternal (\u201cin\ntime, the eternal is the possible, the future\u201d).\n\nWhile the expectation of earthly goods is often\ndisappointed\u2014either because it is fulfilled too late or not at\nall (Kierkegaard [1843\u20131844] 1990: 215)\u2014eternal hope\ncannot in principle be disappointed (Kierkegaard [1847] 1995:\n261\u20133, Kierkegaard [1843\u20131844] 1990: 216). Eternal hope\nmeans \u201cat every moment always to hope all things\u201d\n(Kierkegaard [1847] 1995: 249). Kierkegaard mostly equates eternal\nhope with Christian hope (McDonald 2014: 164).\n\nIn order to understand the relation between earthly and heavenly hope,\nit is helpful to consider the dialectical progression of hope that\nKierkegaard presents in the Nachla\u00df (Malantschuk (ed.) 1978:\n247). There is a kind of hope that occurs spontaneously in youth,\nwhich appears to be a pre-reflexive hope, a kind of immediate trust or\nconfidence (Fremstedal 2012: 52). It is followed by the\n\u201csupportive calculation of the understanding\u201d, i.e., by\nhope involving the reflection about the probability of the hoped-for\noutcome. This (earthly) hope is often disappointed by the lateness or\nnon-arrival of the expected goods. This disappointment is necessary in\norder to acquire eternal hope, which \u201cis against hope, because\naccording to that purely natural hope there was no more hope;\nconsequently this hope is against hope\u201d (Kierkegaard [1851]\n1990: 82). Kierkegaard\u2019s interpretation of Abraham\u2019s story\nin Fear and Trembling can be understood as an illustration of\nthis kind of hope (Lippitt 2015).\n\nWhereas earthly hope is judged by the understanding according to its\nprobability, eternal hope exceeds the limits of understanding. It is\ntherefore commonly judged as irrational or as \u201clunacy\u201d\n(Kierkegaard [1851] 1990: 83). Kierkegaard does not explicitly take up\nthe question of when hope is rational\u2014presumably because eternal\nhope exceeds reason\u2014but he frames the question of good or bad\nhope in terms of \u201chonor\u201d and \u201cshame\u201d\n(Kierkegaard [1847] 1995: 260f.). He observes that a person who\nentertained an earthly hope that has not been fulfilled is very often\ncriticized as imprudent (or \u201cput to shame\u201d (Kierkegaard\n[1847] 1995: 260)) because this is supposed to show that she\n\u201cmiscalculated\u201d (ibid.). Kierkegaard objects to this\nperspective of \u201csagacity\u201d that judges hope only with\nregard to its fulfillment. Rather, we should pay attention to the\nvalue of the hoped-for ends (Kierkegaard [1847] 1995: 261). Eternal\nhope, on this account, \u201cis never put to shame\u201d\n(Kierkegaard [1847] 1995: 260, see also 263). Further, and in line\nwith the Christian tradition, he argues that the value of hope depends\non its relation to love: We hope for ourselves if and only if we hope\nfor others, and only to the same degree. Love\n\n\nis the middle term: without love, no hope for oneself; with love, hope\nfor all others\u2014and to the same degree one hopes for oneself, to\nthe same degree one hopes for others, since to the same degree one is\nloving. (Kierkegaard [1847] 1995: 260)\n\n\nThus, similarly to Kant\u2019s account, one\u2019s hope stands in a\nproportional relationship to an ethical demand. However, Kierkegaard\ndoes not see hope limited by our meeting an ethical\ndemand.\n\n\nRather, Kierkegaard sees the proportional relation as determining\nwhether we are in fact hoping, and the actual degree of our\nexpectancy. Our hope for ourselves is only realizable in and through\nour hope for another. (Bernier 2015: 315)\n\n\nAs already mentioned, Schopenhauer represents the opposite approach in\npost-Kantian philosophy. Even though he holds that it is natural for\nhumans to hope (Parerga and Paralipomena II, 1851: \u00a7313), he\nalso claims that we generally ought to hope less than we are inclined\nto, calling hope a \u201cfolly of the heart\u201d (ibid.).\nAmbivalent remarks concerning the value of hope (he interprets\nPandora\u2019s box as containing all the goods, Parerga and\nParalipomena II, 1851: \u00a7200) can be found throughout his\nwritings, but on the whole, criticism prevails. There are two aspects\nto his critical evaluation of hope: hope\u2019s influence on the\nintellect and its role for happiness. In Schopenhauer\u2019s\ndichotomy of the will and the intellect, hope is an expression of the\nwill or, more precisely, an inclination. One reason why hope is\nproblematic with respect to its influence on the intellect is that it\npresents what we wish for as probable (The World as Will and\nRepresentation, vol. 2, [1818] 1958: 216, 218). Schopenhauer\nconcedes that hope sharpens our perception insofar as it makes certain\nfeatures of the world salient. But he links this thesis to the\nstronger claim that hope may make it (often) impossible to\ngrasp things that are relevant. Hope thus distorts cognition in a\nproblematic way because it hinders the intellect in grasping the\ntruth. However, Schopenhauer also concedes the possibility of a\npositive effect of hope, namely as motivation and support of the\nintellect (The World as Will and Representation, vol. 2,\n[1818] 1958: 221).\n\nWith regard to its contribution to personal happiness, Schopenhauer\nmentions a positive role of hope in his comparison of the life of\nanimals with that of humans. He states that animals experience less\npleasure than humans, because they lack hope and therefore the\npleasures of anticipation. But hope can not only lead to\ndisappointment when the hoped-for object is not realized, it can even\nbe disappointing when it is fulfilled if the outcome does not provide\nas much satisfaction as was expected (The World as Will and\nRepresentation, vol. 2 [1818] 1958: 573). Schopenhauer also\ncriticizes Kant\u2019s idea that we may hope for our own happiness in\nproportion to our moral conduct (the highest good). This conception of\nhope, according to Schopenhauer, leads Kant to remain implicitly\ncommitted to a form of eudaimonism (Basis of Morality II,\n\u00a73, 34).\n\nThus, even though Schopenhauer occasionally hints at positive aspects\nof hope, his overall evaluation of hope is negative. This is\nconsistent with his view that life is filled with unavoidable\nfrustration and suffering, and that suffering can be reduced only by\ngetting rid of one\u2019s desires. Ideally, this amounts to the\n\u201cnegation of the will to life\u201d (The World as Will and\nRepresentation, vol. 1, [1818] 2010: 405). The \u201ctemptations\nof hope\u201d (The World as Will and Representation, vol. 1,\n[1818] 2010: 419) function as obstacles to the negation of the will,\nwhereas hopelessness can help to transform one\u2019s mind and\nacquire \u201cgenuine goodness and purity of mind\u201d (The\nWorld as Will and Representation, vol. 1, [1818] 2010: 420).\nInterestingly, Schopenhauer does have sympathies with the idea of\nsalvation, which lies in the denial of the will (Schopenhauer [1818]\n1958: 610), that is, he seems to subscribe to a kind of transcendent\nhope for an end of all suffering (Schulz 2002: 125). Even though he\ndoes not say so, one could characterize his view as a \u201chope for\nthe end of hope\u201d.\n\nNietzsche is perhaps the most famous critic of hope in the\npost-Kantian tradition. In the third preface to Zarathustra,\nhe warns: \u201cdo not believe those who speak to you of\nextraterrestrial hopes!\u201d (Zarathustra, [1883\u201385]\n2006: 6) Similarly, in Beyond Good and Evil (1886) he opposes\nall notions of hope \u201cin hidden harmonies, in future blessedness\nand justice\u201d (Beyond Good and Evil, [1886] 2008: 562).\nIn his interpretation of Pandora\u2019s myth (Human, All Too\nHuman, 1878: \u00a771), he calls hope \u201cthe worst of all evils\nbecause it prolongs the torments of man\u201d. However, a closer look\nreveals that, outside his criticism of religious and metaphysical\nhopes, he also hints at a positive perspective on hope:\n\u201cthat mankind be redeemed from revenge: that to me is\nthe bridge to the highest hope and a rainbow after long\nthunderstorms\u201d (Zarathustra, [1883\u201385] 2006: 77).\nNietzsche counts hope among the \u201cstrong emotions\u201d\n(Nietzsche [1887] 2006: 103), next to anger, fear, voluptuousness, and\nrevenge. Furthermore, he repeatedly characterizes hope using the\nmetaphor of a rainbow: \u201chope is the rainbow over the cascading\nstream of life\u201d [\u201cDie Hoffnung ist der Regenbogen \u00fcber\nden herabst\u00fcrzenden j\u00e4hen Bach des Lebens\u201d] (as cited in\nBidmon 2016: 188). However, the metaphor of the \u201crainbow\u201d\nis ambivalent. On the one hand, it is connected to Nietzsches vision\nof the \u201coverman\u201d: \u201cDo you not see it, the rainbow\nand the bridges of the overman?\u201d (Zarathustra,\n[1883\u201385] 2006: 36). On the other hand, however, the rainbow is\nelusive and withdraws itself\u2014Nietzsche calls it an\n\u201cillusory bridge\u201d (Zarathustra, [1883\u201385]\n2006: 175; see also Bidmon 2016: 188f.). In Beyond Good and\nEvil, he finally claims that we should \u201cfix our\nhopes\u201d in \u201cnew philosophers\u201d, \u201cin minds strong\nand original enough to initiate opposite estimates of value\u201d\n(Beyond Good and Evil, [1886] 2008: 600). In Human, All\nToo Human, he similarly envisages change of the social order as\nan object of hope:\n\n\n[W]e are only reasonably entitled to hope when we believe that we and\nour equals have more strength in heart and head than the\nrepresentatives of the existing state of things. (Human, All Too\nHuman, 1878: \u00a7443)\n\n\nReasonable hope is thus grounded in a trust in one\u2019s capacity to\nbring about the desired outcome. However, Nietzsche adds that usually\nthis hope amounts to \u201cpresumption, an\nover-estimation\u201d (ibid.).\n\nCamus follows Nietzsche in declaring (religious) hope the worst of all\nevils (Judaken and Bernasconi 2012: 264). His critique of hope is\nlinked to the idea that the human existence is absurd.\nThe \u201celusive feeling of absurdity\u201d (Camus 1955: 12) is\ncharacterized by a discrepancy: The human mind asks fundamental\nquestions about the meaning of life, but the world does\nnot provide answers. Camus\u2019 understanding of the absurd is best\ncaptured in the image of Sisyphus, who exemplifies life\u2019s\nabsurdity in his \u201cfutile and hopeless labor\u201d (Camus 1955:\n119). The assumption that life is absurd goes hand in hand with the\ndenial of religious hope for salvation. In his early writing\nNuptials ([1938] 1970), Camus opposes religious ideas about\nthe immortal soul and hope for an afterlife. In fact,\n\u201c[h]ope is the error Camus wishes to\navoid\u201d (Aronson 2012). Even though Camus is often regarded as an\nexistentialist, he distances himself from this movement.\nOne reason is precisely his disagreement with the account of hope of\nthe existentialists, Kierkegaard in particular, of which he says that\n\u201cthey deify what crushes them and find reason to hope in what\nimpoverishes them. That forced hope is religious in all of them\u201d\n(Camus 1955: 32).\n\nAs already mentioned, one kind of hope that Camus flatly rejects is\nreligious hope for a life beyond death. A second kind of hope,\nprimarily discussed in The Rebel, is the hope founded on a\ngreat cause beyond oneself, i.e., \u201chope of another life one must\n\u2018deserve\u2019\u201d (Camus 1955: 8). The problem with hoping for\nsocial utopias, according to Camus, is that they tend to be\ndictatorial. A further reason to reject such hopes seems to be that\nthey distract from the life of the senses, from the here-and-now and\nfrom appreciating the beauty of this life. We also do not need hope to\ncope with the hardships of life and death: Instead of hoping for a\nlife after death (or committing suicide), one should be conscious of\ndeath as \u201cthe most obvious absurdity\u201d (Camus 1955: 59) and\n\u201cdie unreconciled and not of one\u2019s own free will\u201d\n(Camus 1955: 55). Sisyphus exemplifies the attitude of lucidity and\nconsciousness that Camus recommends. Even though he does not hope for\na better future,\u2014or rather because he does not hope for\na better future\u2014\u201c[o]ne must imagine Sisyphus happy\u201d\n(Camus 1955: 123).\n\nDespite his criticism of hope, Camus states that it is (nearly)\nimpossible to live without hope, even if one wishes to be free of hope\n(Camus 1955: 113). Presumably this claim is only descriptive, stating\na fact about human psychology. However, in a letter to his friend and\npoet Ren\u00e9 Char, Camus called The Rebel a \u201clivre\nd\u2019espoir\u201d [book of hope] (Schlette 1995: 130). On that\nnote, it has recently been suggested that Camus allows for a positive\nview of hope\u2014a kind of \u201c\u00e9trange espoir\u201d [strange\nhope] that is directed towards the possibilities inherent in the\npresent (Schlette 1995: 134) and that is characterized by humanism and\nsolidarity with all human beings (Bidmon 2016: 233).\n\nWhereas the positive role of hope in Camus is at best hidden, it\nsurfaces prominently in the writings of Marcel. At the heart of\nMarcel\u2019s account of hope is the distinction between \u201c\u2018I\nhope\u2026\u2019, the absolute statement, and \u2018I hope\nthat\u2026\u2019\u201d (Marcel [1952] 2010: 26). Marcel is mostly\ninterested in a general, absolute hope, which he conceives as\n\u201cthe act by which [\u2026] temptation to despair is actively or\nvictoriously overcome\u201d (Marcel [1952] 2010: 30f.). One way in\nwhich Marcel characterizes the \u201cmystery\u201d (Marcel [1952]\n2010: 29) of hope is by alluding to the connection between hope and\npatience (Marcel [1952] 2010: 33). Hope implies the respect for\n\u201cpersonal rhythm\u201d (ibid.) and \u201cconfidence in a\ncertain process of growth and development\u201d (Marcel [1952] 2010:\n34). Marcel takes up the question of the rationality of hope in asking\nwhether hope is an illusion that consists in taking one\u2019s wishes\nfor reality (Marcel [1952] 2010: 39). He answers that this objection\nagainst the value of hope applies primarily to hopes that are directed\ntowards a particular outcome (\u201cto hope that X\u201d), but it\ndoes not apply when hope transcends the imagination. Because the\nperson who hopes simpliciter does not anticipate a particular\nevent, her hope cannot be judged with regard to whether it is likely\nto be fulfilled. Marcel illustrates this with the example of an\ninvalid (Marcel [1952] 2010: 40). If this person hopes that he will be\nhealthy at a certain point in time, there is the danger of\ndisappointment and despair if it does not happen. However, absolute\nhope, Marcel explains, implies a \u201cmethod of surmounting\u201d:\nThe patient has absolute hope if he realizes that \u201ceverything is\nnot necessarily lost if there is no cure\u201d (Marcel [1952] 2010:\n40). Being a \u201ctheistic Existentialist\u201d (Treanor and\nSweetman 2016) like Kierkegaard, Marcel ultimately connects this\npossibility of absolute hope to the existence of God. Absolute hope is\nnecessarily connected to faith in God and is a \u201cresponse of the\ncreature to the infinite Being to whom it is conscious of owing\neverything that it has\u201d (Marcel [1952] 2010: 41).\n",
