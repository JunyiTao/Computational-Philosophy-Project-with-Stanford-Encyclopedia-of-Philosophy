    "main_text": "Analyzing social convention || Lewis\n3.2 Lewis\n\n\nLewis develops a broadly Humean perspective by employing game\ntheory, the mathematical theory of strategic interaction among\ninstrumentally rational agents. Drawing inspiration from Thomas\nSchelling\u2019s The Strategy of Conflict (1960), Lewis\ncenters his account around the notion of a coordination\nproblem, i.e., a situation in which there are several ways agents\nmay coordinate their actions for mutual benefit.\n\n\nSuppose \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) want to meet for dinner. They can\nchoose between two restaurants, Luigi\u2019s and\nFabio\u2019s. Each agent is indifferent between the two\nrestaurants, and each agent prefers meeting the other one to not\nmeeting. We represent this situation through a payoff\nmatrix:\n\n\n\n\nLuigi\u2019s\nFabio\u2019s\n\n\nLuigi\u2019s\n1, 1\n0, 0\n\n\nFabio\u2019s\n0, 0\n1, 1\n\n\nRestaurant Rendezvous Payoff Matrix\n\n\n\nThe rows (respectively, columns) represent \\(A\\)\u2019s\n(respectively, \\(B\\)\u2019s) possible strategies: in\nthis case, their two restaurant options. Each cell contains the\nrespective payoffs for \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) for a given\nstrategy combination. Since there are two incompatible ways that\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\) might achieve a mutually desirable result,\nthe two \u201cplayers\u201d must coordinate their actions.\n\n\nIn several respects, Restaurant Rendezvous is an unrepresentative\ncoordination problem. First, \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) must perform the\nsame action in order to achieve the desired result. Second,\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\) achieve identical payoffs in each circumstance.\nThe following payoff matrix represents a coordination problem lacking\nthese two properties:\n\n\n\n\nCall back\nWait\n\n\nCall back\n0, 0\n1, 2\n\n\nWait\n2, 1\n0, 0\n\n\nTelephone Tag Payoff Matrix\n\n\n\nAs an intuitive interpretation, imagine that \\(A\\) and\n\\(B\\) are speaking on the phone but that they are disconnected.\nWho should call back? Each would prefer that the other call back, so as\nto avoid paying for the call. However, each prefers paying for the call\nto not talking at all. If both try to call back, then both will receive\na busy signal. The payoff matrix summarizes this situation. This kind\nof case is sometimes called an impure coordination problem,\nsince it enshrines a partial conflict of interest between players.\n\n\nCoordination problems pervade social interaction. Drivers must\ncoordinate so as to avoid collisions. Economics agents eliminate the\nneed for barter by coordinating upon a common monetary currency. In\nmany such cases, there is no way to communicate in advance, and there\nis no centralized authority to impose order. For instance, prisoners in\nPOW camps converge without any centralized guidance upon a single\nmedium of exchange, such as cigarettes.\n\n\nLewis analyzes convention as an arbitrary, self-perpetuating\nsolution to a recurring coordination problem. It is self-perpetuating\nbecause no one has reason to deviate from it, given that others\nconform. For example, if everyone else drives on the right, I have\nreason to as well, since otherwise I will cause a collision.\nLewis\u2019s analysis runs as follows (p. 76):\n\n\n\nA regularity \\(R\\) in the behavior of members of a population\n\\(P\\) when they are agents in a recurrent situation \\(S\\) is\na convention if and only if it is true that, and it is common knowledge\nin \\(P\\) that, in any instance of \\(S\\) among members of\n\\(P\\),\n\n\n(1) everyone conforms to \\(R\\);\n\n\n(2) everyone expects everyone else to conform to \\(R\\);\n\n\n(3) everyone has approximately the same preferences regarding all\npossible combinations of actions;\n\n\n(4) everyone prefers that everyone conform to \\(R\\), on\ncondition that at least all but one conform to \\(R\\);\n\n\n(5) everyone would prefer that everyone conform to \\(R'\\),\non condition that at least all but one conform to \\(R'\\),\n\n\nwhere \\(R'\\) is some possible regularity in the behavior\nof members of \\(P\\) in \\(S\\), such that no one in any\ninstance of \\(S\\) among members of \\(P\\) could conform both\nto \\(R'\\) and to \\(R\\).\n\n\nLewis finally settles upon a modified analysis that allows\noccasional exceptions to conventions. The literature spawned by\nLewis\u2019s discussion tends to focus on the exceptionless\ncharacterization given above.\n\n\nLewisian convention is a special case of Nash equilibrium, the\ncentral idea behind modern game theory. An assignment of strategies to\nplayers is a Nash equilibrium iff no agent can improve his payoff by\ndeviating unilaterally from it. An equilibrium is strict iff\neach agent decreases his payoff by deviating unilaterally from\nit. Intuitively, a Nash equilibrium is a \u201csteady state\u201d,\nsince each player behaves optimally, given how other players behave. In\nthis sense, Nash equilibrium \u201csolves\u201d the strategic problem\nposed by a game, so it is sometimes called a \u201csolution\nconcept\u201d. However, Lewisian convention goes well beyond Nash\nequilibrium. In a Lewisian convention, everyone prefers that\neveryone else conform if at least all but one conform.\nEquilibria with this property are sometimes called coordination\nequilibria.\n\n\nBy classifying \\(R\\) as a convention only if there is some\nalternative regularity \\(R'\\) that could serve as a\nconvention, Lewis codifies the intuitive idea that conventions are\narbitrary. This was one of the most widely heralded features\nof Lewis\u2019s definition, emphasized by both Quine (1969) and Putnam\n(1981).\n\n\nNotably, Lewis introduces the concept of common knowledge.\nRoughly, \\(p\\) is common knowledge iff everyone knows \\(p\\),\neveryone knows that everyone knows \\(p\\), everyone knows that\neveryone knows that everyone knows that \\(p\\), etc. The subsequent\ngame-theoretic and philosophical literature offers several different\nways of formalizing this intuitive idea, due to researchers such as\nRobert Aumann (1976) and Stephen Schiffer (1972). Recently, some\ncontroversy has arisen concerning the precise relation between these\nlater formalizations and Lewis\u2019s own informal remarks. Robin\nCubitt and Robert Sugden (2003) argue that Lewis\u2019s conception of\ncommon knowledge is radically different from the later formalizations,\nwhile Peter Vanderschraaf (1998) and Giacomo Sillari (2005) downplay\nthe differences. \nSee the entry on\n common knowledge\n for discussion of this controversy and of how common knowledge informs both\ngame theory and the philosophical study of convention.\n\n\nIn the later paper \u201cLanguages and Language\u201d (1975/1983), Lewis\nsignificantly altered his analysis of convention. \nSee section 7, \n Conventions of language,\nfor details.\n",
