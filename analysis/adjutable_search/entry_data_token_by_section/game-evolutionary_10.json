    "main_text": "Philosophical Problems of Evolutionary Game Theory || The meaning of fitness in cultural evolutionary interpretations\n6.1 The meaning of fitness in cultural evolutionary interpretations\n\nAs noted previously, evolutionary game theoretic models may often be\ngiven both a biological and a cultural evolutionary interpretation. In\nthe biological interpretation, the numeric quantities which play a\nrole analogous to \u201cutility\u201d in traditional game theory\ncorrespond to the fitness (typically Darwinian fitness) of\n individuals.[15]\n How does one interpret \u201cfitness\u201d in the cultural\nevolutionary interpretation?\n\nIn many cases, fitness in cultural evolutionary interpretations of\nevolutionary game theoretic models directly measures some objective\nquantity of which it can be safely assumed that (1) individuals always\nwant more rather than less and (2) interpersonal comparisons are\nmeaningful. Depending on the particular problem modeled, money, slices\nof cake, or amount of land would be appropriate cultural evolutionary\ninterpretations of fitness. Requiring that fitness in cultural\nevolutionary game theoretic models conform to this interpretative\nconstraint severely limits the kinds of problems that one can address.\nA more useful cultural evolutionary framework would provide a more\ngeneral theory which did not require that individual fitness be a\nlinear (or strictly increasing) function of the amount of some real\nquantity, like amount of food.\n\nIn traditional game theory, a strategy\u2019s fitness was measured by\nthe expected utility it had for the individual in question. Yet\nevolutionary game theory seeks to describe individuals of limited\nrationality (commonly known as \u201cboundedly rational\u201d\nindividuals), and the utility theory employed in traditional game\ntheory assumes highly rational individuals. Consequently, the utility\ntheory used in traditional game theory cannot simply be carried over\nto evolutionary game theory. One must develop an alternate theory of\nutility/fitness, one compatible with the bounded rationality of\nindividuals, that is sufficient to define a utility measure adequate\nfor the application of evolutionary game theory to cultural\nevolution.\n",
