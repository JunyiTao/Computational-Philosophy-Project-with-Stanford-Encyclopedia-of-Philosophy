    "main_text": "Epistemic issues I: Representing cells || Micrographs\n4.1 Micrographs\n\nAs discussed above, in the seventeenth century both Hooke and van\nLeeuwenhoek pioneered the use of light microscopes to observe cells.\nSubsequent investigators often designed their own microscopes. The\nvariations in these designs contributed to variability in the\nresulting images. (Before photography, microscopists drew what they\nsaw using the microscope, introducing another source of variation.)\nThe variability of the images different researchers produced was one\nfactor that led biologists in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries\nto examine more carefully the processes through which microscopes\ngenerate images (Schickore 2001, 2007). In his theoretical studies of\nlenses, Newton (1704) characterized two types of aberrations created\nby lenses: spherical aberrations, resulting from light rays coming\ninto focus at different points, and chromatic aberrations, resulting\nfrom light of different wavelengths being refracted at different\nangles. Schickore (2007) describes the many efforts by microscope\ndevelopers to correct for these aberrations and the creation of test\nobjects for evaluating the reliability of particular microscopes.\nDuring the same time enthusiasts were advancing many claims about what\nthey saw, some of which were shown later to be artifacts. For example,\nboth Milne-Edwards (1823) and Dutrochet (1824) reported round\nstructures of a constant size similar to that reported for cells,\nwhich they termed globules. (See Schickore 2009 for a\ndetailed examination of the reports of globules and an argument that\nit was the variability in these reports that contributed to the\ngrowing sense that something was amiss in the practices of the\nmicroscopists.) Globules were, however, soon shown to be the products\nof spherical aberrations. In the early nineteenth century several lens\nmakers developed strategies for eliminating spherical aberrations and\ngreatly limiting chromatic aberration (chromatic aberrations were not\nfully eliminated until the introduction of the apochromatic lenses in\nmid-century). As a result, the observations by Schleiden, Schwann, and\nothers discussed above were largely free of these distortions.\n\nLight microscopes faced another limit, that on magnification (a\nlimitation imposed by the wave length of light). For cell researchers\nto obtain higher-resolution images that could reveal constituents of\ncells, a microscope relying on different physical principles was\nrequired. The most important alternative to the light microscope for\nstudying cells was the (transmission) electron microscope, which\nemploys beams of electrons to create images in a manner comparable to\nphotography: locations on the photographic plate hit by many electrons\nare black in the negative and white in the positive image. When\nstructures in the cell scatter electrons, the location in the negative\nremains white and appears dark in the positive image. Although\nelectron microscopes were available in the early 1930s, only in the\nyears just before and during World War II did biologists begin to\nexplore their potential. One difficulty they confronted is that most\neukaryotic cells are too thick to be penetrated by the 50kV electron\nbeam available in the first electron microscopes. Microtomes had been\ndeveloped for cutting slices of cells for light microscopy, but new\napproaches to microtome design were required to slice cells\nsufficiently thinly without creating distortions. This problem was not\nsolved until the early 1950s (Porter & Blum 1953). Accordingly,\nsome of the first electron micrograph studies focused on fibrous\nmaterial such as collagen (Schmitt, Hall, & Jakus 1942) or on\nbacteria (Stanley & Anderson 1941). Porter, Claude, and Fullam\n(1945) created the first electron micrograph of a eukaryotic cell by\nculturing it under conditions where the periphery spread very thinly,\nallowing electrons to penetrate. They generated an image\n (Figure 4)\n that showed at the periphery \n\n\nfilamentous mitochondria of various lengths and fairly constant width;\nscattered, small elements of high density especially abundant around\nthe nucleus and presumably representing Golgi bodies; and a delicate\nlace-work extending throughout the cytoplasm. (1945: 246)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Comparison of images of\nfibroblast from a tissue cultured chick embryo as seen with electron\nmicroscope (left) and light microscope (right). From Porter, Claude,\nand Fullam (1945: plate 10).\n\n\nBesides the challenge of creating preparations sufficiently thin to be\npenetrated by the electron beam, researchers confronted a number of\nother challenges in preparing biological material for electron\nmicroscopy. For example, specimens must be placed in vacuum, and this\nrequires first removing all water, the primary constituent of cells,\nwithout inducing to many distortions. Several historians and\nphilosophers (Rheinberger 1995, Rasmussen 1997, and Bechtel 2006) have\nexamined how biologists confronted these challenges and evaluated the\nreliability of the resulting micrographs. How they addressed one\nchallenge\u2014that of creating sufficient contrast in the\nimages\u2014greatly affected the images that were produced. This was\nalready a challenge with light microscopy: cell material is mostly\ntranslucent so that the light transmitted is mostly of the same\nwavelength, making it hard to differentiate the various structures in\nthe image. To address the challenge, light microscopists in the\nmid-nineteenth century began experimenting with dyes used for fabrics.\nAs noted in\n Section 2,\n Flemming named the nuclear structures he observed chromatin since\nthey bound the aniline dye he was using. The problem for electron\nmicroscopy was similar\u2014cell components differ little in their\nability to block electron transmission. Electron microscopists found\nthat several of the fixatives used in light microscopy, especially\nthose involving heavy metals, enhanced the ability to block electrons,\nand accordingly the contrast in the resulting images. Given that there\nwas little knowledge about what given chemicals would bind to within\nthe cell, the investigation of these stains was mostly pursued by\nresearchers trying out different compounds and procedures for applying\nthem (exemplified in Palade\u2019s 1952, study of osmium tetroxide)\nto see what images they could generate. Indeed, different stains\n(osmium tetroxide, glutaraldehyde, etc.) did yield different\nimages.\n",
