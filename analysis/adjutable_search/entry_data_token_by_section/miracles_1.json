Some stable background\nis, in fact, presupposed by the use of the term, as William Adams\n(1767: 15) notes:\n\n\nAn experienced uniformity in the course of nature hath been always\nthought necessary to the belief and use of miracles. These are indeed\nrelative ideas. There must be an ordinary regular course of nature,\nbefore there can be any thing extraordinary. A river must flow, before\nits stream can be interrupted.\n\n\nAs it stands, however, this definition leaves us wanting a more\nprecise conception of what is meant by the order or course of nature.\nWe might therefore try to tighten the definition by saying that a\nmiracle is an event that exceeds the productive power of nature (St.\nThomas Aquinas, SCG 3.103; ST 1.110, art. 4), where\n\u201cnature\u201d is construed broadly enough to include ourselves\nand any other creatures substantially like ourselves. Variations on\nthis include the idea that a miracle is an event that would have\nhappened only given the intervention of an agent not wholly bound by\nnature (Larmer 1988: 9) and that a miracle is an event that would have\nhappened only if there were a violation of the causal closure of the\nphysical world.\n",
