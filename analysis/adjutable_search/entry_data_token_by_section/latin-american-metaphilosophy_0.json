    "main_text": "Preliminaries\n1. Preliminaries\n\nThe nature of philosophy in Latin America first drew the attention of\nphilosophically-minded thinkers in the early nineteenth century, when\nthe region began to develop into nations independent from Spain. But\nit acquired greater significance with the birth of contemporary\nacademic philosophy in the following century, ultimately taking center\nstage in Latin American philosophy during the second half of the\n20th century, where we still find it today. Often motivated\nby discomfort with mainstream conceptions of philosophy, inquiry into\nthe nature of Latin American philosophy has involved a number of\nsub-questions about its existence, originality, authenticity,\nsignificance, and role in culture and society. The search for answers\nhas led to reflection on what philosophy is (or should be),\nas a practice, and as an academic discipline. Thus many Latin American\nphilosophers have devoted their attention to the philosophy of Latin\nAmerican philosophy, and therefore, to metaphilosophy (understood as\nin Williamson 2007, p. ix). Somewhat paradoxically, many of those\nengaged in such metaphilosophical inquiry have shown skepticism about\nwhether there is a philosophy that can rightly be called \u2018Latin\nAmerican.\u2019 Others have recast an old, reductive conception of\nLatin American philosophy that ascribes to it a certain limited\nsocio-political role. But as discussed in what follows, there is also\na third group made up of philosophers whose views about the nature and\nquality of Latin American philosophy turns out to be neither skeptical\nnor reductionist in any of the ways to be considered here.\n",
