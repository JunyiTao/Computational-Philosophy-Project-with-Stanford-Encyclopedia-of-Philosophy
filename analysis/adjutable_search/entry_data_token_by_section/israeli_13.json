    "main_text": "Psychology || Free Will and Negation of Akrasia\n4.4 Free Will and Negation of Akrasia\n\nAccording to Israeli, a human being can act in a number of ways when\nfaced with a specific situation. The reason for this ability is the\ncapacity of discernment, and more specifically of cogitation and\nconsideration. Due to these capacities people are able to acquire\ntheoretical and practical knowledge and to differentiate between good\nand evil. Because animals do not possess intellectual capacities, they\nare limited to acting in a definite way in particular situations.\nHowever, the ability of humans to act in different ways is a\nconsequence of humans\u2019 position between pure intellect and\nbeast. People use their cogitation and consideration to attain a\nhigher level of knowledge. However, as long as humans use those\ncapacities their knowledge will remain imperfect and they will\ncontinue to hesitate and be uncertain. When they are united with\nintellect they no longer are uncertain and act in the best possible\nway in all situations without any tension in their soul. According to\nIsraeli, the certainty of truth cancels all kinds of bad\ntemptations.\n\nOne may interpret Israeli here as saying that if a man has an\nimperfect knowledge that it is bad to eat unhealthy candies, his\nknowledge and his temptation for these candies are in struggle in his\nsoul. His capacities of consideration and cogitation\n(\u05d0\u05dc\u05e4\u05db\u05e8) have to decide between this\nimperfect knowledge and the temptation. Once this person attains\nperfect knowledge, he or she no longer wishes to eat the candies. S.\nSadik argues that Israeli\u2019s remarks constitute a Socratic\nnegation of akrasia (Sadik 2013).\n",
