    "main_text": "Mysterianism || Positive Mysterianism\n4.2 Positive Mysterianism\n\nIn contrast, the positive mysterian holds that the trinitarian\ndoctrine can\u2019t be understood because of an abundance of content.\nThat is, the doctrine seems to contain explicit or implicit\ncontradictions. So while we grasp the meaning of its individual\nclaims, taken together they seem inconsistent, and so the conjunction\nof them is not understandable, in the sense explained above. The\npositive mysterian holds that the human mind is adequate to understand\nmany truths about God, although it breaks down at a certain stage,\nwhen the most profound divinely revealed truths are entertained.\nSometimes an analogy with recent physics is offered; if we find\nmysteries (i.e., apparent contradictions) there, such as light\nappearing to be both a particle and a wave, why should we be shocked\nto find them in theology\u00a0(van Inwagen 1995, 224\u20137)?\n\nThe best-developed positive mysterian theory is that of James Anderson\n(2005, 2007), who develops Alvin Plantinga\u2019s epistemology so\nthat beliefs in mysteries (merely apparent contradictions) may be\nrational, warranted, justified, and known. Orthodox belief about the\nTrinity, Anderson holds, involves\u00a0believing, for example, that\nJesus is identical to God, the Father is identical to God, and that\nJesus and the Father are not identical. Similarly, one must believe\nthat the Son is omniscient, but lacks knowledge about at least one\nmatter. These, he grants, are apparent contradictions, but\nfor the believer they are strongly warranted and justified by the\ndivine testimony of scripture. He argues that numerous attempts by\nrecent theologians and philosophers to interpret one of the apparently\ncontradictory pairs in a way that makes the pair consistent always\nresult in a lapse of orthodoxy (2007, 11\u201359). He argues that the\nChristian should take these trinitarian mysteries to be\n\u201cMACRUEs\u201d, merely apparent contradictions resulting from\nunarticulated equivocations, and he gives plausible non-theological\nexamples of these (220\u20135).\n\nIt is plausible that if a claim appears contradictory to someone, she\nthereby by has a strong epistemic \u201cdefeater\u201d for that\nbelief, i.e., a further belief or other mental state which robs the\nfirst belief of rational justification and/or warrant. A stock example\nis a man viewing apparently red objects. The man then learns that a\nred light is shining on them. In learning this, he acquires a defeater\nfor his belief that the items before him are red. Thus with the\nTrinity, if the believer discovers an apparent contradiction in her\nTrinity theory, doesn\u2019t that defeat her belief in that theory?\nAnderson argues that it does not, at least, if she reflects properly\non the situation. The above thought, Anderson argues, should be\ncountered with the doctrine of divine incomprehensibility, which says\nthat we don\u2019t know all there is to know about God. Given this\ntruth, the believer should not be surprised to find herself in the\nabove epistemic situation, and so, the believer\u2019s trinitarian\nbelief is either insulated from defeat, or if it\u2019s already been\ndefeated, that defeat is undone by the preceding realization (2007,\n209\u201354).\n\nDale Tuggy (2011a) argues that Anderson\u2019s doctrine of divine\nincomprehensibility is true but trivial, and not obviously relevant to\nthe rationality of belief in apparent contradictions about God. The\nprobability of our being stuck with such beliefs is a function not\nonly of God\u2019s greatness in comparison to humans\u2019 cognitive\npowers, but also of what and how much God chooses to reveal about\nhimself. Nor is it clear that God would be motivated to pay the costs\nof inflicting apparently contradictory divine revelations on us.\nMoreover, Anderson has not ruled out that the apparent contradictions\ncome not from the texts alone, but also from our theories or\npre-existing beliefs. Finally, he argues that due to the comparative\nstrength of \u201cseemings\u201d, a believer committed to paradoxes\nlike those cited above will, sooner or later, acquire an epistemic\ndefeater for her beliefs.\n\nIn a reply, Anderson (2018) denies that divine incomprehensibility is\ntrivial, while agreeing that many things other than God are\nincomprehensible (297). While Tuggy had attacked his suggestions about\nwhy God would want to afflict us with apparent contradictions,\nAnderson clarifies that\n\n\u2026my theory doesn\u2019t require me to identify\npositive reasons for God permitting or inducing MACRUEs. For even if I\nconcede Tuggy\u2019s point that \u201cthe prior probability of God\ninducing MACRUEs in us is either low or inscrutable,\u201d the\ndoctrine of [divine] incomprehensibility can still serve as\u2026an\nundercutting defeater for the inference from D appears to be\nlogically inconsistent to D is false. (298\u20139)\n\n\nThe defense doesn\u2019t require, Anderson argues, any more than that\nMACRUEs are \u201cnot very improbable given theism\u201d\n(299). As to whether these apparent contradictions result from the\ntexts rightly understood, or whether they result from the texts\ntogether with mistaken assumptions we bring to them, this is a\nquestion only biblical exegesis can decide, not any a priori\nconsiderations (300). As to Tuggy\u2019s charge that a believer in\ntheological paradoxes will inevitably acquire an undefeated defeater\nfor her beliefs, Anderson argues that this has not been shown, and\nthat Tuggy overlooks how a believer may reasonably add a relevant\nbelief to her seemingly inconsistent set of beliefs, such as that the\napparently conflicting claims P and Q are only approximately true, or\nthat \u201cP and Q are the best way for her to conceptualize matters\ngiven the information available to her, but they don\u2019t represent\nthe whole story\u201d (304).\n\nAnderson\u2019s central idea is that the alleged\u00a0contradictions\nof Christian doctrine will turn out to be merely apparent. In\ncontrast, some theologians have held that doctrines including the\nTrinity imply not merely apparent but also real contradictions, but\nare nonetheless true. Such hold that there are exceptions to the law\nof non-contradiction. While some philosophers have argued on mostly\nnon-religious grounds for\n dialetheism,\n the claim that there can be true (genuine, not merely apparent)\ncontradictions, this position has for the most part not been taken\nseriously by analytic theologians (Anderson 2007, 117\u201326) (For a\nrecent exception, see Beall 2019.)\n",
