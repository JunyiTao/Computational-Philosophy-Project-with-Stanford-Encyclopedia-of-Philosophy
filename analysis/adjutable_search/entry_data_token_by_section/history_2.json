As Max Weber (1949)\nnotes, there is an infinite depth to historical reality, and therefore\nit is necessary to select a finite representation of the object of\nstudy if we want to approach a problem rigorously. Let us imagine, for\nexample, that a historian is interested in cities and their\ndevelopment over time. This might be pursued as an economic question,\na question of regional geography, a question about cultural change, a\nquestion about poverty and segregation, a question about municipal\ngovernance, or a question about civil disturbances, and so one, for\nindefinitely many aspects of urban life. One generation of historians\nmay be especially interested in cultural topics, while another\ngeneration is preoccupied with the organization of the economy at\nvarious points in history. The two orientations lead to very different\nhistorical representations of the past. Both inquiries lead to true\ndepictions of the cities in question, but their findings and\ninterpretations are very different. Likewise, the historian needs to\nmake choices about location; is he or she interested in the cities of\nBritain, the cities of Europe, or all cities in the world? Further,\nthe historian must consider whether to conduct a comparative\nhistory of cities, examining similarities and differences in the\ndevelopment of Paris and London; or instead restrict attention to a\nsingle case. Simply collecting \u201chistorical facts\u201d about\ncities in the past is not a valid mode of historical inquiry. The\nquestion of how historians select and identify their subjects for\nresearch is an important one for the philosophy of history, and it has\ngreat significance for how we think about \u201cknowing the\npast\u201d.\n\nWeber\u2019s essays on methodology (1949) provide insight about these\nquestions. Weber emphasizes the role that the scholar\u2019s\nvalues play in his or her selection of a subject matter and a\nconceptual framework. So it is always open to historians of later\ngenerations to reevaluate prior interpretations of various aspects and\nperiods of history. There is no general or comprehensive approach to\ndefining the historical; there is only the possibility of a series of\nselective and value-guided approaches to defining specific aspects of\nhistory. We are always at liberty to bring forward new perspectives\nand new aspects of the problem, and to arrive at new insights about\nhow the phenomena hang together when characterized in these new ways.\nThis inherent selectivity of historical knowledge does not undermine\nthe objectivity or veridicality of our knowledge; it merely entails\nthat \u2013 like mathematics \u2013 history is inherently\nincomplete.\n\nDoing history also forces the historian to make choices about the\nscale of the history with which he or she is concerned. Suppose\nwe are interested in Asian history. Are we concerned with Asia as a\ncontinent, including China, India, Cambodia, and Japan, or the whole\nof China during the Ming Dynasty, or Hubei Province? Or if we define\nour interest in terms of a single important historical event like the\nChinese Revolution, are we concerned with the whole of the Chinese\nRevolution, the base area of Yenan, or the specific experience of a\nhandful of villages in Shandong during the 1940s? Given the\nfundamental heterogeneity of social life, the choice of scale makes an\nimportant difference to the findings.\n\nHistorians differ greatly around the decisions they make about scale.\nIt is possible to treat any historical subject at the micro-scale.\nWilliam Hinton provides what is almost a month-to-month description of\nthe Chinese Revolution in Fanshen village\u2014a collection of a few\nhundred families (Hinton 1966). Likewise, Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie\noffers a deep treatment of the villagers of Montaillou; once again, a\nsingle village and a limited time (Le Roy Ladurie 1979). William\nCronon provides a focused and detailed account of the development of\nChicago as a metropolis for the middle of the United States (Cronon\n1991). These histories are limited in time and space, and they can\nappropriately be called \u201cmicro-history.\u201d\n\nMacro-level history is possible as well. William McNeill provides a\nhistory of the world\u2019s diseases (McNeill 1976); Massimo\nLivi-Bacci offers a history of the world\u2019s population\n(Livi-Bacci 2007); and De Vries and Goudsblom provide an environmental\nhistory of the world (De Vries and Goudsblom 2002). In each of these\ncases, the historian has chosen a scale that encompasses virtually the\nwhole of the globe, over millennia of time. These histories can\ncertainly be called \u201cmacro-history.\u201d\n\nBoth micro- and macro-histories have important shortcomings.\nMicro-history leaves us with the question, \u201chow does this\nparticular village shed light on anything larger?\u201d.\nMacro-history leaves us with the question, \u201chow do these large\nassertions about the nature of revolution or the importance of class\nconflict in mobilization apply in the context of Canada or\nWarsaw?\u201d. The first threatens to be so particular as to lose all\ninterest, whereas the second threatens to be so general as to lose all\nempirical relevance to real historical processes.\n\nThere is a third choice available to the historian that addresses both\npoints. This is to choose a scale that encompasses enough time and\nspace to be genuinely interesting and important, but not so much as to\ndefy valid analysis. This level of scale might be regional\u2014for\nexample, G. William Skinner\u2019s analysis of the macro-regions of\nChina (Skinner 1977). It might be national\u2014for example, a social\nand political history of Indonesia. And it might be\nsupra-national\u2014for example, an economic history of Western\nEurope or comparative treatment of Eurasian history. The key point is\nthat historians in this middle range are free to choose the scale of\nanalysis that seems to permit the best level of conceptualization of\nhistory, given the evidence that is available and the social processes\nthat appear to be at work. And this mid-level scale permits the\nhistorian to make substantive judgments about the \u201creach\u201d\nof social processes that are likely to play a causal role in the story\nthat needs telling. This level of analysis can be referred to as\n\u201cmeso-history,\u201d and it appears to offer an ideal mix of\nspecificity and generality.\n",
