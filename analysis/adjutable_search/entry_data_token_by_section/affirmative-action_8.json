    "main_text": "The Integration Argument\n9. Desert Confounded, Desert Misapplied\n\n\nThe affirmative action debate throws up many ironies but one in\nparticular should be noted. From the time in 1973 when Judith Jarvis\nThomson conjectured that it was \u201cnot entirely\ninappropriate\u201d that white males bear the costs of the\ncommunity\u2019s \u201cmaking amends\u201d to African-Americans and women\nthrough preferential affirmative action, the affirmative action debate\nhas been distracted by intense quarrels over who deserves\nwhat. Do the beneficiaries of affirmative action deserve\ntheir benefits (Allen 2011)? Do the losers deserve their loss?\n\n\nChristopher Edley, the White House assistant put in charge of\nPresident Clinton\u2019s review of affirmative action policy in 1994\u201395,\nspeaks of how, during the long sessions he and his co-workers put in\naround the conference table, the discussion of affirmative action kept\ncircling back to the \u201ccoal miner\u2019s son\u201d \n question (I\u2019ve changed the gender for expository purposes).\n\n\nImagine a college admissions committee trying to decide between the\nwhite [son] of an Appalachian coal miner\u2019s family and the African\nAmerican son of a successful Pittsburgh neurosurgeon. Why should the\nblack applicant get preference over the white\napplicant? (Edley 1996, 132ff)\n\n\n\n\nWhy, indeed? This is a hard question if one defends affirmative action\nin terms of compensatory or distributive justice. If directly doing\njustice is what affirmative action is about, then its mechanisms must\nbe adjusted as best they can to reward individual desert and true\nmerit. The \u201ccoal miner\u2019s son\u201d example is meant to throw\ndesert in the defender\u2019s face: here is affirmative action at\nwork thwarting desert, for surely the coal miner\u2019s son\u2014from the\nhard scrabble of Harlan County, say\u2014has lived with far less\nadvantage than the neurosurgeon\u2019s son who, we may suppose, has reaped\nall the advantages of his father\u2019s (or mother\u2019s) standing. Why should\nthe latter get a preference?\n\n\nA defender might answer in the way that Charles Lawrence and Mari\nMatsuda do in their 1997 book, We Won\u2019t Go Back:\n\u201cAll the talk about class, the endless citings of the\n\u2018poor white male from Appalachia,\u2019 cannot avoid the\nreality of race and gender privilege\u201d (Lawrence and Matsuda\n1997, 190\u2013191). As they see it, because white privilege persists\nracial preferences really do balance the scales. Because male\nprivilege persists, gender preferences really do make selections\nfairer. Lawrence and Matsuda brook no concession: in every case the\nloser in affirmative action is not the more deserving.\n\n\nEven Justice Brennan tried his hand at this argument, writing in\nBakke:\n\n\nIf it was reasonable to conclude\u2014as we hold that it\nwas\u2014that the failure of minorities to qualify for admission at\n[the University of California at] Davis [Medical School] under regular\nprocedures was due principally to the effects of past discrimination,\nthen there is a reasonable likelihood that, but for pervasive racial\ndiscrimination\u2026[Bakke] would have failed to qualify for\nadmission even in the absence of Davis\u2019 special admissions\n program (Bakke, at 365\u20136 [Brennen, dissenting]).\n\n\n\n\nBakke was not denied anything to which he had moral claim in the\nfirst place.\n\n\n\nJust as Mary Anne Warren and James Rachels in the 1970s thought that\nthe losers under affirmative action were losing only illicit\nprivileges, and the gainers merely gaining what should have been theirs\nto start with, so Michel Rosenfeld in the 1990s, in his extended\n\u201cdialogic\u201d defense of affirmative action, echoes the same\nthought:\n\n\nAlthough affirmative action treats innocent white males unequally, it\nneed not deprive them of any genuine equal opportunity rights.\nProvided an affirmative action plan is precisely tailored to\nredress the losses in prospects of success [by African-Americans and\nwomen] attributable to racism and sexism, it only deprives innocent\nwhite males of the corresponding undeserved increases in their\nprospects of success\u2026. [R]emedial affirmative action does\nnot take away from innocent white males anything that they have\nrightfully earned or that they should be entitled to\n keep (Rosenfeld 1991, 307\u20138, emphasis added).\n\n\n\n\nHowever, programs that give blanket preferences by race or gender are\nhardly \u201cprecisely tailored\u201d to match desert and reward\nsince, as Lawrence and Matsuda themselves acknowledge at one place,\nthe white male \u201cprivilege\u201d is \u201cstatistical\u201d\n(Lawrence and Matsuda 1997, 252).  Yet it is individuals, not\nstatistical averages, who gain or lose in admissions determinations\nand employment selections.[29] \n\n\nThe persistence of this strategy of defense reflects a residual\nfeeling that the fruits of affirmative action are somehow spoiled if they are\nnot deserved (Harris 2003). Nevertheless, it is the wrong strategy for defending\nreal world affirmative action. The programs legitimated under the\nCivil Rights Act, in both their nonpreferential and preferential\nforms, had\u2014and have\u2014a clear aim: to change institutions so\nthat they can meet the nondiscrimination mandate of the Act. Selection\nby race or gender was\u2014and is\u2014a means to such change. To\nthe extent that such selection also compensates individuals for past\nwrongs or puts people in places they really deserve, these are\nincidental by-products of a process aimed at something else.\n\n\nThe same is true with university admissions policy. When the Medical\nSchool of the University of California at Davis offered four reasons\nin defense of the special admissions program that left Bakke on the\noutside, none of these reasons said anything about matching admissions\nand desert. The criteria of the special admissions program\u2014race\nand ethnicity\u2014were instruments to further ends: integrating the\nclassroom, the profession, and the delivery of medical services, and\nbreaking the chain of self-reproducing societal discrimination.\nLikewise, when the University of Michigan and the University of Texas\ndefended their programs they pointed not to desert rewarded but\neducational value generated.\n\n\nNow, if the neurosurgeon\u2019s son because of his race can\nadvance each of these goals and the coal miner\u2019s son, because of\nhis race, cannot, then isn\u2019t the selection decision easy? Pick\nthe African-American neurosurgeon\u2019s son (however advantaged\nhe may be) over the\nwhite coal miner\u2019s son (even if he is the\nmost deserving creature imaginable). The aims of real world\naffirmative action make race and ethnicity (and sometimes gender)\nsalient, not personal desert or merit. The test of real world\naffirmative action lies in the urgency of its ends (preventing\ndiscrimination, promoting diversity or integration) and the aptness\n(moral and causal) of its means (racial, ethnic, and gender\npreferences).  Both remain much in dispute.\n\n",
