    "main_text": "Never Dying || Never Dying Would be a Misfortune\n8. Can Death\u2019s Harmfulness be Reduced?\n\nEven if death is usually bad for those of us who die, perhaps it\nneed not be bad for us, if we prepare ourselves suitably.\nThis might be possible if some form of preferentialism is true, and\nif, by altering our desires, we could cease to have any interests that\ndying would impair. For then we might be able to thanatize\nour desires, in this sense: we might abandon all desires that death\nmight thwart. Among these are desires we can satisfy only if we live\non for a few days, but also desires we cannot possibly satisfy within\nthe span of a normal lifetime, and the desire for immortality itself.\nInstead of desiring that some project of mine succeed, which is a\ndesire that might be thwarted by my death, I might instead adopt a\nconditionalized version of this desire, namely: should I live on, let\nmy project succeed. If all goes well, thanatizing would insulate us\nfrom harm from death by leaving us with no interests with which dying\ninterferes.\n\nUnfortunately, this strategy will backfire. The main problem is that\ndeath can interfere with desire fulfillment not just by falsifying the\nobjects of our desires but also by precluding our having desires\n(Luper 2013). So even if we resolve, from now on, to limit ourselves\nto desires whose objects cannot be falsified by death, we are still\nvulnerable to the harm death will do us if it precludes our having and\nfulfilling desires. Hence thanatizing would force us to avoid having\nany desires whose fulfillment would have benefitted us, and to deny\nourselves such desires would be as bad for us as the harm we are\ntrying to avoid.\n\nHowever, the core idea of adapting our desires is useful, if not taken\nto an extreme. It is prudent to avoid taking on goals we cannot\npossibly attain, and hence prudent to eschew projects that cannot\npossibly be completed during the course of a normal lifetime.\n",
