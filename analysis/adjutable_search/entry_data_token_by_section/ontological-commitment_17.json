    "main_text": "Frege and Neo-Fregeanism || Neo-Fregeanism\n5.2 Neo-Fregeanism\nThus far, we have canvassed Frege's argument that, if sentences\ncontaining numerical singular terms are true, then those terms refer\nto numbers. The last step in the argument\u2014that the objects\nreferred to by numerical singular terms satisfy the sortal concept of\nnumber\u2014invoked the following identity criterion for numbers:\n\nHume's Principle. The number of Fs is identical\nwith the number of Gs if and only if there is a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between the Fs and the Gs. \n\nFrege considered, but rejected, the idea that Hume's Principle, by\nitself, could be taken to define the concept of number. His rejection\nwas based on what has come to be known as the \u201cCaesar\nProblem\u201d: Hume's Principle allows one to decide whether the\nnumber of Fs is identical with q, when q is\ngiven in the form \u2018the number of Gs\u2019, but it\nfails to do so when q is not given in that form. Thus, Frege\n(1884: \u00a756) requires that we be able to\n\n decide by means of our definitions whether any\nconcept has the number Julius Caesar belonging to it, or whether that\nsame familiar conqueror of Gaul is a number or not.\n\n Frege thus opted instead to define numbers explicitly in terms of\nextensions: the number of Fs = the extension of the concept\n\u2018equal to the concept F\u2019 (where F is equal to\nG just in case the Fs are in one-to-one correspondence\nwith the Gs). These explicit definitions arguably allow Frege\nto maintain the logicist thesis that arithmetic is logic: they define\nnumbers as logical objects in the sense that their existence\ncan be justified on the basis of (Frege's) logic alone. But, as is\nwell known, these explicit definitions foundered on the inconsistency\nof Frege's underlying theory of extensions, in particular, the na\u00efve\ncomprehension principle embodied in his Basic Law V.\nThe Neo-Fregean seeks to defend arithmetical platonism and\nlogicism by taking a different tack: Hume's Principle by itself is\ntaken to provide a contextual definition of numbers.  The viability of\nthis approach is secured by the result now called Frege's\nTheorem: Hume's Principle, when added to a suitable system of\nsecond-order logic, suffices for the proof of the basic laws of\narithmetic, Peano's axioms (see Wright 1983:\n158\u201369). Arithmetical logicism is secured if Hume's Principle\ncan be shown to be analytic in an appropriate sense. Arithmetical\nplatonism, with numbers as logical objects, is secured because, when\nlogical truths are substituted for the right-hand side of Hume's\nPrinciple, the resulting instance on the left-hand side is also\nlogically true, and explicitly refers to numbers.\nFor our purposes, the main interest of the Neo-Fregean approach is\nthat it leads to a conception of ontological commitment more liberal\nthan any yet considered. This conception arises from the\nNeo-Fregean's particular way of understanding Hume's\nPrinciple. First, since Hume's Principle is to define the\nconcept of number, the left- and right-hand sides of the principle\nmust at least have the same truth conditions.  Second, sentences with\nthe same truth conditions have the same ontological commitments. This\nsecond assumption amounts to a sense in which being supervenes on\ntruth: circumstances cannot differ with respect to what there is\nwithout differing with respect to what is true. It follows from these\ntwo assumptions that the left- and right-hand sides of Hume's\nPrinciple have the same ontological commitments. But that still\nleaves open three different ways that Hume's Principle can be viewed\n(Wright 1990). First, one might reject it on the grounds\nthat the left- and right-hand sides clearly do not have the same\nontological commitments: the numerical identity on the left-hand side\nis committed to numbers; the claim that two concepts are equal on the\nright-hand side is not. On this view, only a conditionalized version\nof Hume's Principle could be accepted: \u201cif there are numbers,\nthen \u2026\u201d (Field 1984). In response, the neo-Fregean can\nsay that this confuses \u201chaving the same truth conditions\u201d\nwith some more fine-grained equivalence such as \u201cexpressing the\nsame thought\u201d. Only the latter requires that both sides refer\nto the same objects, where reference is a kind of explicit\nontological commitment.[45]\nA second response takes Hume's Principle to provide\nan ontological reduction of numbers to concepts, and\nrelations between concepts. On this view, Hume's Principle is true,\nbut ontological commitments should be read off of the right-hand\nside. Since the right-hand side, it is supposed, is not ontologically\ncommitted to numbers, the left-hand side\u2014being\ntruth-conditionally equivalent\u2014cannot be ontologically committed\nto numbers either; surface grammar is deceptive here. This response is\nin line with the standard Quinean approach to paraphrase as a means of\neliminating ontological commitment.  But, as noted\nin \u00a74.2, it is unclear what justifies\nthe asymmetric attitude with respect to commitment. Granted, there is\nno explicit ontological commitment to numbers by the\nright-hand side; but once one allows that ontological commitment can\nbe implicit, it is unclear why one cannot say that it is the surface\ngrammar of the right-hand side that is deceptive with respect\nto ontological commitment.\nThe third response, that of the Neo-Fregean, is to say that\nontological commitments should be read off of the left-hand side, and\nthat therefore both sides are ontologically committed to numbers.\nThis is no idle preference. It is backed up by the Fregean argument\nconsidered above that the left-hand side is ontologically committed to\nnumbers in virtue of containing numerical singular terms. The symmetry\nis broken.\nThe neo-Fregean thus endorses a sufficient condition for\nontological commitment much weaker than the Fregean account:\n\nNeo-Fregean Account.  Suppose that t is a\nsingular term purporting to refer to objects of kind K.  Then\nany theory truth-conditionally equivalent to a theory containing the\nterm t is ontologically committed\nto Ks.\n\nTo illustrate: \u201cthere are exactly as many forks as\nknives\u201d is ontologically committed to numbers because it is\ntruth-conditionally equivalent to \u201cthe number of forks is\nidentical with the number of knives\u201d, which contains a singular\nterm \u2018the number of forks\u2019 which purports to refer to\nnumbers.\nThe liberality of the neo-Fregean account of ontological commitment\nis best appreciated by considering its application to abstraction\nprinciples for which, unlike Hume's Principle, the right-hand side\nappears to be entirely about concrete entities, and so appears to be\nacceptable to a nominalist. For example, consider the abstraction\nprinciple for directions: the direction of line a is\nidentical to the direction of line b if and only\nif a is parallel to b (where a\nand b are concrete). According to the neo-Fregean account,\nthe claim that concrete lines a and b are parallel\nis committed, by itself, to abstract objects,\ndirections.[46]\nMoreover, it has this commitment whether or not any mind ever grasps\nthe concept of direction, or formulates the corresponding abstraction\nprinciple. In general, commitments to abstracta are\nconcomitant with certain commitments to concreta, and\ninseparable from them, regardless of our ways of\nconceptualizing.[47]\n",
