This\ncourse resulted in a series of papers, gathered together as\nPhilosophy and the Spontaneous Philosophy of the Scientists\n(1967a), in which Althusser began rethinking the relations among\nphilosophy, science, ideology, and politics. Though this revision was\nlater to be made more explicit, one of the most striking aspects of\nthese papers was Althusser\u2019s abandonment of the Spinozistic\nclaim that the different levels of theoretical practice were\nautonomous. He now maintained that there was no criterion sufficient\nto demarcate scientific from ideological concepts and that all\ntheoretical concepts are marked by ideology. This did not mean,\nhowever, that any concept was as good as any other. Scientists,\nthrough their work on the material real, tended to generate better\nunderstandings of things than were available intuitively. Further, he\nargued that philosophy still had a role to play in the clarification\nof scientific concepts. This is the case because, no matter how much\nwork scientists do to understand the material real and to generate\nbetter concepts, they must always employ ideological concepts to frame\ntheir investigations and its results. Marxist philosophers, he\nmaintained, could be useful to scientists by pointing out, from the\nstandpoint of politics and by the method of historical critique, where\nand how some of the concepts scientists employed were ideological. The\nresult of this intervention of philosophy into politics would not be\n\u201ctruer\u201d concepts, but ideas that were more\n\u201ccorrect\u201d or \u201cright\u201d in both the normative and\npositive senses of these words.\n\nParallel to this move, and motivated by the need to provide the link\nbetween philosophical theory and political practice that was largely\nmissing from his classic work, Althusser now argued that philosophy\nhad a useful role to play between politics and science. Political\npractice, Althusser maintained, was mostly motivated by ideological\nunderstandings of what the good is and how to accomplish it. Though he\ndid not argue that there was a way to leave ideology behind and to\nreveal the good in itself, he did maintain that science could help to\ncorrect ideological thinking about political means and ends. Social\nscience in particular could do so by showing how certain goals were\nimpossible or misguided given present socio-economic relations and by\nsuggesting that, at a certain time and in a certain place, other means\nand other ends might be more fruitfully adopted and pursued. As\nscientific knowledge does not speak directly to the public or to\npoliticians, Althusser assigned materialist philosophers the job of\ncommunicating scientific knowledge of the material real, its\nconditions, and its possibilities to politicians and the public. If\nthis communication is successful, Althusser maintained, one should not\nexpect all political activity to be successful. Instead, one should\nexpect a modest shift from an idealist ideology to one that is\nmaterialist and more scientific and which has a better chance of\nrealizing its goals.\n",
