    "main_text": "The Nature of Modality || Non-necessitarianism also vindicated\n2.2 Non-necessitarianism also vindicated\n\nIf particular finite things exist necessarily in virtue of being\nconsidered in relation to the whole series of finite things, two\nlingering questions remain:\n\n(4) Can you and I ever grasp such all-encompassing ways of conceiving\nparticular things?\n\n\n(5) Are there other, less inclusive ways of considering a finite\nobject in virtue of which it does not exist necessarily?\n\n\nWith the respect to (4), Spinoza\u2019s answer is unfortunately\nnegative. Spinoza sometimes describes the mental corollary of these\nvery inclusive and complete ways of conceiving objects in terms of\nadequacy, and he is very pessimistic about our ability to\nhave adequate ideas of particular things (see especially\nIIp24\u201331, though he holds out more hope in Part Five). Spinoza\neven links our natural tendencies to represent objects independent of\ntheir infinitely extensive causal networks with their contingency\n(IIp31c), just as the above interpretation predicts. So while we can\nunderstand the metaphysical principles which guarantee the necessary\nexistence of a finite thing insofar as it is conceived in relation to\nevery other finite thing, we tend to adopt far more limited concepts\nof finite things, in virtue of which necessitarianism is false.\nSpinoza remains confident that there is a complete way of\nconceiving a particular finite object in relation to all others, but\nit is unlikely that we will ever be able to psychologically grasp such\ncomplete and necessitating concepts. Spinoza\u2019s\nmetaphysics meets his psychology here, and psychology wins.\n\nThis is an unfortunately negative answer in the light of\nSpinoza\u2019s ethical theory. As a systematic thinker, Spinoza\nthinks metaphysical conclusions about modality have consequences for\nethics. Although pursuing the relations between Spinoza\u2019s\nmetaphysics and ethics are beyond the scope of this entry (see\nNewlands 2018), Spinoza clearly thinks that ethically relevant\nconclusions follow from his metaphysics of modality. For example, he\nwrites in Vp6:\n\nInsofar as the mind understands all things as necessary, it has a\ngreater power over the affects, or is less acted on them.\n\n\nSpinoza thinks we morally improve by gaining power over our passive\naffects and becoming more active (Vp4), so our inability to conceive\nfinite things as related to everything else (and so as existing\nnecessarily) means our prospects for moral perfection are quite\ndim.\n\nWith respect to (5), Spinoza suggests that there are more and less\ncomplete ways of genuinely conceiving objects (see, for instance,\nIp24d and IVd3\u20134). If there are true but incomplete ways of\nconceiving objects, Spinoza will occupy the interesting position of\nconsistently affirming both necessitarianism and its denial, relative\nto these different ways of conceiving objects. This pairing sounds\nlike a contradiction until we appreciate the force of Spinoza\u2019s\nconceptualist account of modality. If the truth-value of modal\npredications is sensitive to ways of conceiving objects (as a modern\nday anti-essentialist might agree), and if Spinoza endorses a variety\nof modally salient ways of conceiving objects, then he can\nconsistently affirm both the truth and falsity of full-blown\nnecessitarianism relative to different ways of conceiving finite\nobjects.\n\nIf this is all correct (a very big \u201cif\u201d!), then Garrett\nand Curley\u2019s conclusions can both be right, though\nneither tells the complete modal story. Something less than full-blown\nnecessitarianism will be true in virtue of ways of conceiving objects\nthat do not include their relations to the entire, infinitely large\nand complex range of other particular things. At the same time,\nfull-blown necessitarianism will also be true in virtue of ways of\nconceiving finite things that are maximally inclusive with respect to\nrelations to the rest of the world. This middle ground provides an\nanswer to Curley\u2019s otherwise worrisome objection to the\nnecessitarian interpretation: \u201cIf each particular feature of the\nuniverse, considered in itself, is contingent, then their totality is\nalso contingent\u201d (Curley 1988,\n 49).[16]\n This expansion of contingency from the part to the whole would be\ntrue only if the shift in the ways finite things are conceived did not\nsometimes entail a shift in their modal status. Although this is a\nvery widespread essentialist assumption today, it is a false\none according to this reading of Spinoza\u2019s modal theory.\nJust as necessitarianism at the most expansive conceptual level does\nnot jeopardize contingency at narrower levels, so too contingency at\nnarrower levels need not bleed into the modal status of things\nconceived in the most expansive way.\n",
