Damian\u2019s Main Approach\n\n\nThe second question discussed by Damian in De divina\nomnipotentia asks whether God is able to bring it about that what\nhas been done has not been done. Damian\u2019s discussion of the question is\nsomewhat complicated, and he is not too explicit about what he is\ndoing. There are some interrelated passages which offer what can be\nidentified as Damian\u2019s main approach (601C\u2013610D, 615A\u2013B, 618B\u2013D,\n620C\u2013D). Towards the end, there is a passage which Damian marks as an\nadditional consideration (619A\u2013620C; see\n Section 5.2).\n\n\nDamian\u2019s main approach to the second question is to argue that the\npast cannot be undone because what God has made cannot lose its status\nof having been. Before directly arguing this point, Damian presents two\npreliminary considerations which help to put the question in the proper\nsetting. The first of these preliminary considerations is related to\nsome discussions within the art of dialectic whereas the second is\ntheological in nature.\n\n\nIn the first preliminary consideration (602D\u2013604B; see also 609A and\n615A\u2013B), Damian connects the question about undoing the done to what he\nsays is a disputed question of dialectic, \u201cthe question about the\nconsequence of necessity and impossibility\u201d (quaestio ... de\nconsequentia necessitatis vel inpossibilitatis, 604A).\n\n\nIn Damian\u2019s view, those who have put the question about God\u2019s\nability to undo what has been done have acted impetuously, for they do\nnot understand the import of their query. They are asking whether God\ncan bring it about that what has been done, will not have been done.\nHowever, the kind of impossibility that is implied here concerns not\nonly what is past but also what is present or future. One must also ask\nwhether God can bring it about that what is, is not, or whether he can\nbring it about that what will be, will not be. In Damian\u2019s view, the\nlogic in these questions is the same. The rules of dialectic say that\nfrom the factuality of any statement, regardless of the tense, you can\ninfer its necessity and the impossibility of its contradictory in the\nfollowing manner: what has been, necessarily has been, and it is\nimpossible that it has not been; what is, necessarily is, as long as it\nis, and it is impossible that it is not; what will be, necessarily will\nbe, and it is impossible that it will not be (602D\u2013603B).\n\n\nWhat should one think of the necessity and impossibility which\nfollow from any true singular statement? Does it follow that everything\nhappens of necessity (so that not even God can do anything about it)?\nThere was a disputed question in the dialectic of Damian\u2019s time which\ndealt with these kinds of queries. The root of the question is\nAristotle\u2019s discussion of singular future statements in De\ninterpretatione 9 which the eleventh-century dialecticians read in\nBoethius\u2019s Latin translation. They also knew what Boethius said about\nthe theme in his two commentaries to De interpretatione and in\nPhilosophiae consolatio. These works provide the background\nfor the question that Damian refers to, but the formulation which\nDamian knows appears to be of early medieval invention (see Holopainen\n1999, 230\u2013232; Holopainen 2006). Damian himself says that the question\nis an old question from the liberal arts which has newly been taken up\nagain. However, the contemporary discussion is different from the\nancient one in that the ancients discussed the question purely as a\nquestion of dialectic, whereas the contemporary writers have turned it\ninto a quasi-theological question that has bearing on divine power\n(604A).\n\n\nAnother contemporary source with information about the question is\nthe discussion in Cur deus homo II.17 by Anselm of Canterbury,\nsome thirty years later. Anselm makes a distinction between two kinds\nof necessity: there is preceding necessity (necessitas\npraecedens) and there is subsequent necessity (necessitas\nsequens). Preceding necessity is an efficient kind of necessity,\nand it is the cause of a thing\u2019s being the case. The subsequent\nnecessity does not cause anything, but is caused by a thing\u2019s being the\ncase. The necessity which follows from any true singular statement in\nany tense is subsequent necessity. Anselm\u2019s discussion implies that the\nquestion about the consequence of necessity and impossibility arises\nfrom the failure to keep the two kinds of necessity separate (Knuuttila\n1993, 74; Knuuttila 2004, 122\u2013124; Marenbon 1996, 12\u201316; Holopainen\n1999; Binini 2017, 251\u2013253).\n\n\nDamian does not tell us how the question about the consequence of\nnecessity and impossibility can be resolved. It is possible that he was\nfamiliar with the kind of solution that one can find in Cur deus\nhomo II.17 (see Holopainen 1999, 227\u2013232; Holopainen 2006,\n116\u2013119). At any rate, Damian takes it for granted that the question\ncan be solved in a manner which does not restrain omnipotence for he\nrejects the question as irrelevant to a discussion about divine power\n(604A\u2013B; cf. 609A and 615A\u2013B). In the same context, Damian also makes a\ncomment about applying dialectic to theology: when dialectic and other\nbranches of human knowledge are applied to the investigation of\ntheological matters, they must serve as a maid (ancilla)\nserves her mistress; they must not try to adopt the leading position.\nDamian also accuses his discussion companions of being incompetent in\nthe field of their art: they do not yet know the rudiments of\ndialectic, but nevertheless they try to apply it to theological issues\n(603B\u2013D).\n\n\nThe second preliminary consideration in Damian\u2019s main approach to\nthe second question focuses on divine providence. Drawing mainly on\nAugustine\u2019s writings, Damian presents a lengthy discussion concerning\nGod\u2019s eternity and his relation to created beings (604C\u2013608A; see also\n599A\u2013B and 618C\u2013D). God is immutable, both in himself and in his\nrelation to creation. He is not in any time or place, but all times and\nplaces, as well as all creatures, are contained in \u201cthe treasure\nof God\u2019s wisdom\u201d, or in his providence (providentia). To\nGod there is no past or future; everything is present to him in an\neternal now. To him, nothing changes or moves; everything that streams\nby or goes past in time stands immutably and eternally in his\nprovidence.\n\n\nThe doctrine of divine providence puts the question about changing\nthe past in a new perspective (see 607A\u2013610D). This doctrine warrants\nDamian\u2019s claim that the same considerations apply to things past,\npresent and future, at least when we are discussing God\u2019s power. The\ndoctrine of divine providence also makes it immediately clear what the\nanswer to the second question has to be: the past cannot be changed\nbecause the past events are immutably present in the divine\nprovidential plan which is immutable (607A).\n\n\nTo Damian, asking whether God can undo the done is asking whether\nGod can bring about a contradictory state of affairs. In Damian\u2019s view,\nit is obvious that this is something that God cannot do:\nYou, therefore, while you demand that one and the same\nthing both has been and has not been, is and is not, will be and will\nnot be, you truly strive to confuse everything that has been made or is\nto be made and to show that it wavers between being and non-being.\nCertainly, the nature of things will not tolerate this. For nothing can\nbe and not be at the same time; but what is not in the nature of\nthings, is undoubtedly nothing. You ask, therefore, harsh critic, that\nGod make what is not his, that is to say nothing. But behold! the\nEvangelist stands against you, saying that nothing is made without\nhim (John 1:3). God has not yet learned to make nothing. You,\nteach him, and command him to make nothing for you! (608C; translated\nin Holopainen 1996, 32).\n\n\nThe passage provides a justification for the idea that God\u2019s\ninability to undo what has been done does not contradict his\nomnipotence. In Damian\u2019s view, omnipotence consists of God\u2019s power to\nbring about anything that is good. A contradictory state of affairs\nwould be nothing and evil, and therefore the ability to bring it about\nis not included in omnipotence (cf.\n Section 3).\n\n\nIn another passage (608D\u2013610D), Damian appeals to the efficacy of\nGod\u2019s will to argue that a contradictory state of affairs cannot become\nactualized. Here, different considerations apply to the good and the\nevil (cf.\n Section 3).\n The good things are because God\nwills them to be. God\u2019s will as the efficient cause of the being of\nbeings has such intensity that what he wills to be, cannot not be, and\nwhat he does not will to be, cannot be. Good things, then, are\nunequivocally in the case that they are, and a contradictory state of\naffairs cannot be realized through some good thing\u2019s being and not\nbeing at the same moment. As far as good things are concerned, we can\nsay that the validity of the principle of non-contradiction is a\nconsequence of divine omnipotence: it is an indication of the might of\nGod\u2019s will as the efficient cause of being. The same is true of the\nvalidity of the consequence of necessity and impossibility; what some\npeople see as a limitation to God\u2019s power is really an expression of\nhis power (608D\u2013609A, 610B).\n\n\nDamian\u2019s view is blurry when it comes to the validity of the\nprinciple of non-contradiction for evil things. He states that a\ncontradictory state of affairs cannot be realized through some evil\nthing\u2019s being and not being at the same time. However, he supports this\nstatement by pointing out that the being of evil things is apparent and\nnot real: they cannot both \u201cbe\u201d and \u201cnot be\u201d at\nthe same time because they never have the kind of \u201cbeing\u201d\n(esse) that good things have (610B\u2013C). This leaves open the\npossibility that some evil thing could have and not have its\nquasi-being at the same moment of time (cf. Resnick 1992, 110\u2013111). It\nis not clear whether this is an intended feature of Damian\u2019s view or\nnot. In any case, the issue is not relevant for Damian\u2019s discussion\nabout the power of God because God gives being in an unequivocal\nmanner.\n\nIn the conclusion to his main approach, Damian focuses on the principle\nof non-contradiction as he understands it. He first lets us understand\nthat we need not bother about the evil things. As for the rest, i.e.,\nthe good things, it is outrageous to suggest that their being would not\nbe unequivocal: \n\nWhen therefore this question is proposed, with these words:\n\u201cHow can God bring it about that what has been done will not have\nbeen done\u201d, let a brother of sound faith answer that what has\nbeen done, if it was an evil, was not something but nothing, and on\nthat account it must be said not to have been, because what the Maker\nof things did not order to be, did not have the grounds for existence.\nFor he said, and they were made, he ordered, and they were\ncreated (Psalms 32:9). For everything was made by him, and\nnothing was made without him (John 1:3). And therefore to ask,\n\u201cHow can God make it so that what has been done will not have\nbeen done?\u201d is the same as to ask, \u201cCan God bring it about\nthat what he has made he will not have made?\u201d Undoubtedly, what\nGod has made, God will not have made! Therefore, who utters this is to\nbe spat upon, and he is not worthy of reply, but rather should be\ncondemned to branding. (618B\u2013C; translated in Holopainen 1996,\n40).\n\n\nIn Damian\u2019s view, the past cannot be undone because what God has\nmade cannot lose its status of having been (because God has made what\nhe wanted to make, and his will is immutable in eternity). For the same\nreason, the principle of non-contradiction is universally valid for\neverything which has being from God. Also, the things that have being\nfrom God cannot but be when they are, and therefore the consequence of\nnecessity and impossibility is valid for them (609A).\n5.2. A Supplementary Approach\n\n\nTowards the end of De divina omnipotentia, Damian presents\nan additional approach to the question of undoing the done (619A\u2013620C).\nDamian clearly marks the passage as an additional consideration that\ncan be used to combat those impudent people who are not satisfied with\nhis principal solution (619A). In spite of this, the passage has often\nbeen mistaken for Damian\u2019s principal statement of the matter; in many\nselections from the text, only the additional approach is included\nwhereas Damian\u2019s main approach is omitted (except for the question\nabout the consequence of necessity and impossibility).\n\n\nDamian\u2019s main approach has been to show that divine omnipotence\nremains intact even though God cannot undo the done. In the\nsupplementary approach, he pursues a different strategy: there is a\nsense in which it can be said, and not in a foolish way (non\ninepte), that God \u201ccan\u201d (potest) bring it\nabout that what has been done, has not been done. This can be proved as\nfollows. Since God\u2019s power (posse) is coeternal with God\nhimself, it is immutably the same. Before the beginning of time, it was\npossible for God that none of those things that we know as the past\nwould come into being. Therefore, this is possible for him now and\nalways (620A\u2013B).\n\n\nIn his additional approach, Damian purposefully put forward ideas\nthat he knew were problematic. For if it is true that God cannot undo\nwhat has been done, there must be something wrong in any argument that\nseems to prove that he can. To save the faithful among the readers from\ntoo much bewilderment, Damian suggests that the additional\nconsideration that he presents is principally of a grammatical nature.\nNamely, he points out that when we speak about God\u2019s ability to bring\nit about that what has been done, has not been done, the expression\n\u201cHe can (potest) do it\u201d is appropriate for\nspeaking of the eternal God; from our temporal point of view, \u201cHe\ncould have (potuit) done it\u201d is the appropriate way of\nexpressing it (619A\u2013C). If we follow this lead, the statement that God\ncan undo what has been done collapses into the statement that God could\nhave chosen to make the past different from what it actually was\n(Remnant 1978; Moonan 1980; Holopainen 1996, 42). Of course, this is\nnot changing the past properly speaking. What Damian assumes here is\nthat God could have chosen a different providential plan, not that God\ncould make changes in the providential plan that he has actually\nchosen.\n6. Damian\u2019s Objective\n\n\nIt is easy to misunderstand Damian\u2019s position regarding the validity\nof the principle of non-contradiction and the possibility of altering\nthe past. This is partly due to the disorderliness of some of Damian\u2019s\nideas. There is also another important factor which promotes\nmisunderstanding. In Damian\u2019s view, there are some ideas that you\nshould not articulate even though they are true. The idea that God\ncannot undo the done counts among these.\n\n\nThe situation from which De divina omnipotentia resulted\nbegun from Damian\u2019s attempt to regulate what one may utter about God.\nDamian had been sitting at the table of Abbot Didier in Monte Cassino\nand eating. While they were eating, a passage in Jerome\u2019s letter to\nEustochium was read in which it is claimed that even though God is\ncapable of everything (omnia possit), he cannot restore\nvirginity to a woman who has lost it. Damian stated that he had always\nfound it disturbing that an inability (inpossibilitas) was so\nlightly ascribed to God. A discussion followed in which Damian defended\nthe view that God has the power of restoring virginity whereas Didier\nargued for Jerome\u2019s view that he cannot restore it. In Damian\u2019s view,\nthere is a sense in which we can say that God can restore virginity,\nand therefore we must affirm that he can restore it (596C\u2013601B).\n\n\nDamian\u2019s objective at the table of Monte Cassino was to protect the\ndoctrine of divine omnipotence by advising that we should abstain from\nsaying anything which implies that God is powerless in some respect.\nSome of the monks sitting at the table were less interested in Damian\u2019s\nadvice and more interested in the issue of omnipotence in itself. They\nwere bold enough to put a question to Damian: if God is omnipotent in\nall things, as Damian has asserted, does he have the power of bringing\nit about that what has been done has not been done (601C)? We can be\nsure that Damian found this question very annoying. It is a difficult\nquestion, and it is a question that is difficult to handle without\nmaking statements about what God cannot do. Damian does not offer us\nany report about how the discussion continued. However, there is a\nremark in De divina omnipotentia which suggests that Damian\nhimself was accused of implying that God is impotent in a certain\nrespect (620D).\n\n\nDamian\u2019s objective in De divina omnipotentia is twofold.\nFirst, Damian reiterates his point about moderation while talking about\nGod (e.g., 597B\u2013599A, 603B\u2013604B, 614D\u2013616C). He strongly advises that\nwe should abstain from spreading certain kinds of statements, even in\ncases where they are found in the Bible (597B\u2013C). Damian\u2019s most\nimportant motive here seems to be to protect the faith of the simple\nbelievers:\nFor if it should reach the common people that God is\nasserted to be impotent in some respect (which is a wicked thing to\nsay), the unschooled masses would instantly be confused and the\nChristian faith would be upset, not without grave danger to souls.\n(597C; tr. Spade 3.18\u201322).\n\n\nSecond, Damian defends himself against the accusation that he said\nthat God is impotent in a certain respect (620D). His delicate task in\nDe divina omnipotentia is to convince his readers of the view\nthat divine omnipotence remains intact even though God cannot undo the\ndone, without ever saying that God cannot undo the done because this is\n\u201ca wicked thing to say\u201d.",
