    "main_text": "The First Period: Philosophical Politics || The Republic and Laws\n5.1 The Republic and Laws\n\nIt is perhaps no accident that Cicero\u2019s first two major\nphilosophical works should be in political philosophy, given both the\ncrisis faced by the republican system of government and the need to\nproduce work in a field that would be regarded as suitable for a Roman\nstatesman. But the Republic and Laws (in Latin\nDe Re Publica and De Legibus respectively) are in at\nleast one respect radical nonetheless: together with On the\nOrator, they introduce the dialogue form into Latin literature.\nAnd notwithstanding the influence of Plato, the two works can lay\nclaim to being among the most original parts of Cicero\u2019s\nphilosophy, since each deals to a substantial extent with the\ngovernment and institutions of a state of which Plato could have had\nno inkling, namely Rome.\n\nBoth works are intensely Roman. The Republic takes as the\nbest kind of state one that, to a large extent, consists in the\ntraditional structures of the Roman republic. The Laws\nconsiders the sort of laws that will best maintain or restore those\nstructures. To this extent, they challenge the idea, one that Cicero\nsaw reflected in the utopianism of Plato\u2019s Republic,\nthat political philosophy should proceed in isolation from\nconsideration of actual political structures and societies. Yet, in\nways that make their overall message far from straightforward, both\nare deeply influenced by abstract theory as well, and by questions of\nhow theory, history and practical politics interact.\n",
