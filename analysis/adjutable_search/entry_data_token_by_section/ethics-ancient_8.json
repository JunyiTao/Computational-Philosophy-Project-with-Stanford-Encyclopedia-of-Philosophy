    "main_text": "Stoics\n9. Pyrrhonian Skeptics\n\nPyrrho, a murky figure, roughly contemporary with Epicurus and Zeno\nthe Stoic, left no writings. In the late, anecdotal tradition he is\ncredited with introducing suspension of judgment (DL IX 61). He became\nthe eponymous hero for the founding of Pyrrhonian skepticism in the\nfirst century B.C. (See entry on\n Pyrrho\n and on\n Ancient Skepticism.)\n Having discovered that for every argument examined so far there is an\nopposing argument, Pyrrhonian Skeptics expressed no determinate\nopinions (DL IX 74). This attitude would seem to lead to a kind of\nepistemic paralysis. The Skeptics reply that they do not abolish,\ne.g., relying on sight. They do not say that it is unreliable and they\ndo not refuse, personally, ever to rely on it. Rather, they have the\nimpression that there is no reason why we are entitled to rely on it,\nin a given case or in general, even if we go ahead and rely on it\nanyhow (DL IX 103). For example, if one has the visual impression of a\ntower, that appearance is not in dispute. What is in dispute is\nwhether the tower is as it appears to be. For Skeptics, claiming that\nthe tower is as it appears to be is a dogmatic statement about the\nobject or the causal history of the appearance. As far as the Skeptic\nis concerned, all such statements have failed to be adequately\njustified, and all supporting arguments can be opposed by equally\nconvincing counter-arguments. Lacking any grounds on which to prefer\none dogmatic statement or view over another, he suspends judgment.\n\nSuch views have an obvious impact on practical and moral issues. First\nof all, the Skeptics argue that, so far as we have been given any\ncompelling reason by philosophers to believe, there is nothing good or\nbad by nature (Sextus Empiricus, Outlines of Pyrrhonism\n[=PH] III 179\u2013238, Adversus Mathematicos\n[=M] XI 42\u2013109). And just in case he does find such\nreasons compelling, the Skeptic will resist the temptation to assent\nby posing a general counter-argument: what is good by nature would be\nrecognized by everyone, but clearly not everyone agrees \u2013 for\ninstance, Epicurus holds that pleasure is good by nature but\nAntisthenes holds that it is not (DL IX 101) \u2013 hence there is\nnothing good by nature (see section 4 of the entry on\n Moral Skepticism).\n The practical consequences of suspending judgment are illustrated by\ntwo traditions about the life of Pyrrho. In one, Pyrrho himself did\nnot avoid anything, whether it was wagons, precipices, or dogs. It\nwould appear that, suspending judgment about whether being hit by a\nwagon was naturally good or bad, Pyrrho might walk into its path, or\nnot bother to get out of the way. His less skeptical friends kept him\nalive \u2013 presumably by guiding him away from busy roads, vicious\ndogs, and deep gorges. Another tradition, however, says that he only\ntheorized about suspension of judgments, and took action to preserve\nhimself and otherwise lead a normal life, but doing so without any\njudgments as to natural good and bad. Living providently, he reached\nninety years of age (DL IX 62).\n\nIn any event, Pyrrho\u2019s suspension of judgment led to a certain\ndetachment. Not knowing what was good or bad by nature, he was\nindifferent where dogmatists would be unhappy or at least anxious. For\ninstance, he performed household chores usually done by women (DL IX\n63\u201366). Thus Pyrrho\u2019s skepticism detached him from the\ndogmatic judgments of a culture in which a man\u2019s performing\nwomen\u2019s work was considered demeaning. In turn, his skepticism\nand suspension of judgment led to freedom from disturbance\n(ataraxia) (DL IX 68). It is significant that this\npsychological state, so important for Epicureans as part of the end of\nlife, should play a key role in Pyrrhonian skepticism at its beginning\nwith Pyrrho, but certainly in its development with Sextus\nEmpiricus.\n\nWhile suspension of judgment in moral matters brings freedom from\ndisturbance, it does not lead to immoral behavior \u2013 anymore than\nit leads to the foolhardy behavior of the first tradition about\nPyrrho\u2019s life. Sextus generalizes the Skeptic teaching about\nappearances to cover the whole area of practical activity. He says the\nrules of everyday conduct are divided into four parts: (1) the\nguidance from nature, (2) compulsion that comes from bodily states\nlike hunger and thirst, (3) traditional laws and customs about pious\nand good living, (4) the teachings of the crafts (PH, I\n21\u201324). The Skeptic is guided by all of these as by appearance,\nand thus undogmatically. For instance, he would follow the traditional\nlaws about pious and good living, accepting these laws as the way\nthings appear to him to be in matters of piety and goodness but\nclaiming no knowledge and holding no beliefs.\n\nSextus says that the end of life is freedom from disturbance in\nmatters of belief, plus moderate states in matters of compulsion.\nSuspension of judgment provides the former in that one is not\ndisturbed about which of two opposing claims is true, when (as always\nseems to happen) one cannot rationally decide between them. Matters of\ncompulsion cover such things as bodily needs for food, drink, and\nwarmth. While the Skeptic undeniably suffers when hungry, thirsty, or\ncold, he achieves a moderate state with respect to these sufferings\nwhen compared to the person who both suffers them and believes they\nare naturally bad. The Skeptic\u2019s suspension of judgment about\nwhether his suffering is naturally bad gives him a certain detachment\nfrom the suffering, and puts him in a better condition than those who\nalso believe their suffering is naturally bad (PH I\n25\u201330).\n\nAs a consequence, the Skeptic conception of the end of life is similar\nin some ways to Epicurean and Stoic beliefs. For Epicureans the end is\nfreedom from pain and distress; the Stoic identification of virtue and\nthe good promises freedom from disturbance. While Pyrrho and Sextus\nhold freedom from disturbance to be the end of life, they differ from\nthe former over the means by which it is achieved. Both the Epicureans\nand Stoics, for example, hold that a tranquil life is impossible in\nthe absence of virtue. By contrast, Sextus does not have a lot to say\nin a positive vein about virtue, although he does recommend following\ntraditional laws about piety and goodness, and he indicates that the\nSkeptic may live virtuously (PH I 17). Rather, it is for the\nSkeptics an epistemic attitude embodied in a distinctive practice, not\nvirtue, that leads to the desired state. This alone would seem to be\nenough to disqualify Pyrrhonism as a form of eudaimonism.\n\nSextus does however offer his skeptical practice as a corrective to\nthe dogmatists\u2019 misleading path to eudaimonia: it is\nnot possible to be happy while supposing things are good or bad by\nnature (M XI 130, 144). It is the person who suspends\njudgment that enjoys the most complete happiness (M XI 160,\n140). It is important to observe that Sextus proposes his skeptical\npractice as an alternative to dogmatic theories. For\nthe Skeptic makes no commitments, or even assertions, regarding the\nsupposedly objective conditions that are supposed by other\nphilosophers to underlie our natural, human telos.\nAccordingly, some have objected that the kind of tranquility and\nhappiness that the Skeptic enjoys could just as well be produced\nthrough pharmacology or, we might add, Experience Machines. More\ngenerally speaking, the objection is that skeptical tranquility and\nhappiness comes at a cost we should not be willing to pay. By refusing\nto accept the world is ever as it appears, the Skeptic becomes a\ndetached, passive spectator, undisturbed by any of the thoughts that\npass through his mind. Such detachment might seem to threaten his\nability to care about other people as he observes all that happens to\nthem with the same tranquil indifference. Also, he would seem to be at\nbest a moral conformist, unable or at least unwilling to engage in any\nmoral deliberation, either hypothetically or as a means to directly\naddress a pressing moral issue.\n\nSextus provides an example of the latter situation when he imagines\nthe Skeptic being compelled by a tyrant to commit some unspeakable\ndeed, or be tortured (M XI 164\u201366). Critics propose\nthat the Skeptic\u2019s choice will necessarily reveal his evaluative\nconvictions, and thus his inconsistency in claiming to have no such\nconvictions. But Sextus replies that he will simply opt for one or the\nother in accordance with his family\u2019s laws and customs. In other\nwords, he will rely on whatever moral sentiments and dispositions he\nhappens to have. These cognitive states will be neither the product of\nany rational consideration nor will they inform any premises for moral\nreasoning or philosophical deliberation. Like Sartre\u2019s\nexistentialism, Sextus\u2019 skepticism offers a way to respond to\nmoral dilemmas without supposing there is a correct, or even\nobjectively better, choice.\n\nWe should note that it is not entirely fair to ask whether the\nPyrrhonist\u2019s moral life is one that we, non-Skeptics, would deem\ngood or praise-worthy. For, as Sextus would say, we are part of the\ndispute regarding what kind of life is morally good and praise-worthy.\nTo claim that nothing really matters to the Skeptic, for example,\npresupposes some account of the mental state of caring. In the end,\nthe question of how or whether a Skeptic might be morally good is\nequivalent to asking what role belief, or knowledge, plays in the\nmoral goodness of people and their actions. If we suppose that one\nmust, at a minimum, have adequately justified evaluative beliefs\ninforming her actions in order for those actions, and the underlying\ncharacter, to count as morally good, then the Skeptic will be immoral,\nor at least amoral. On the other hand, if the Skeptic manages to\nundermine our confidence in that supposition, we will have to suspend\njudgment regarding whether the Skeptic, or anyone else for that\nmatter, is in fact capable of performing morally good and\npraise-worthy action, or whether their reasoned account of\neudaimonia is true.\n\nThe question we should ask here is whether and in what respect those\nwith strong, rational convictions will be better off than the Skeptic\nwhen confronting moral dilemmas, or even everyday moral choices. If,\nlike the Skeptic, one suspects that the dogmatists\u2019 have no\nknowledge, let alone adequately justified beliefs to guide them, then\nit seems that they are no better or worse off than those who simply\nconform to moral customs and norms.\n",
