    "main_text": "The Controversy between Wolff and the Pietists\n3. The Controversy between Wolff and the Pietists\n\nThomasius would continue to exercise an important influence on German\nphilosophy throughout the first half of the eighteenth century.\nHowever, it was his colleague in the philosophy faculty at the\nFriedrichs-Universit\u00e4t, Christian Wolff, who would contribute the\nmost to the modernization of the German intellectual landscape and the\nspread of the Enlightenment. Wolff achieved this primarily through his\ndistinctive philosophical system, the so-called\n\u201cLeibnizian-Wolffian\u201d philosophy, which incorporated the\nlatest philosophical ideas and methods, including but not limited to\nthose of Leibniz himself. The relevance and accessibility of\nWolff\u2019s system, expanded and refined by his many students,\nquickly saw it gain a foothold in academies across Germany. Wolff was\nnot without his detractors, of course, and none were more vocal, nor\nmore successful (at least initially) in their efforts to limit his\ninfluence, than his Pietist colleagues in the faculty of theology. The\nfamous controversy between Wolff and the Pietists, which at its climax\nsaw Wolff exiled from Prussia on pain of hanging in 1723, put the full\nmenu of modern ideas\u2014including materialism, idealism, atheism,\nand Spinozism\u2014before the literate public and drew the attention\nof the rest of Europe to the German intellectual scene.\n",
