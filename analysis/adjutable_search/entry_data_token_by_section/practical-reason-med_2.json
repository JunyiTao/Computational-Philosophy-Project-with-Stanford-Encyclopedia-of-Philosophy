The Place of Practical Reason in Moral Theory\n\nThe question remains as to how the doctrine of practical wisdom\nrelates to the general moral theory of medieval thinkers. Writers such\nas Eckhart and Taler rejected Aristotelian virtues in favor of more\nreligious ones, acceptance (Gelassenheit) and detachment\n(Abgeschiedenheit), but even Thomas Aquinas had difficulty\nincorporating the rational theory of practical wisdom into his overall\nunderstanding of the moral life. Confronted with the conflicting\nclaims of Aristotelian Ethics and the Augustinian doctrine of grace,\nhe asserts in a sermon to young Dominicans:\n\nThe faith teaches all that is needed for living well. This is clear\nbecause no philosopher with all his efforts before the coming of\nChrist could know as much about God and what is necessary for life as\nan old woman does through faith\u2026\n\n\nWhen faced with a clear choice between the two often conflicting moral\ndoctrines Thomas, like his contemporaries, preferred the religious\ndoctrines to the rationally based ethics of practical wisdom.\n\nThe earliest thirteenth-century interpretations of Aristotle\u2019s\nnotion practical wisdom emphasized the intellectual nature of moral\nvirtue. The pre-1250 commentators on the NE understood\nphronesis as a means whereby a human being could be united to\nthe supreme good, happiness. These early interpreters of Aristotle\nmade the moral life an essentially passive one, in that the\nfelix is elevated to happiness by divine causality. With the\nappearance of the work of Robert Kilwardby, Albert the Great, and\nThomas Aquinas a deeper understanding of Aristotle\u2019s moral\nthought infused the commentaries of the second half of the thirteenth\ncentury. These thinkers, however, were also troubled by the relation\nbetween felicitas and prudentia.\n\nThomas follows the lines sketched by his former teacher, and\ntransforms the nature of Aristotelian ethics into a moral doctrine\nthat is more easily aligned with Christian moral theology. Albert and\nThomas were not content with the unspecified nature of the principles\nof the moral syllogism as described by Aristotle. They left the formal\nstructure of the Aristotelian moral act the same, but altered the\ncontent by adding the specific formulations of the fundamental\nprinciples of natural law that direct all action toward the human\ngood. The moral agent is no longer free to determine from the\nobservation of customs and practices the principles of actions that\ndirect the practical syllogism. The precepts of natural law, which are\nrecognized through the natural power (Albert), or the natural habit\n(Thomas), of synderesis, ensure a universally binding code of conduct.\nPrudence becomes a mechanism whereby one deduces specific actions from\ndetermined laws. The science of morality becomes closer to speculative\ntheory because of the unerring process of determining singular\ndecisions from universal commands. The Franciscan critics of the\nintellectualism of the Dominican commentators on Aristotle emphasized\nthe volitional nature of the will\u2019s desire for goodness. Despite\ntheir agreement that all human moral actions lead ultimately to union\nwith God, the commentators differ upon the natural moral means by\nwhich such a union is caused.\n",
