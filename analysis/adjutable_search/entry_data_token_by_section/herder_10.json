    "main_text": "Moral Philosophy\n8. Moral Philosophy\n\nHerder also develops a powerful and historically influential moral\nphilosophy. This includes positions in both meta-ethics and\nfirst-order morality. Let us consider the former first.\n\nAs in the philosophy of mind, Herder\u2019s position in meta-ethics\nis naturalistic in spirit. Such a position was by no means\nuncontroversial in his day, as can be seen, for example, from his\ncorrespondence with Mendelssohn in 1769 concerning Spalding\u2019s\nand Mendelssohn\u2019s religious, afterlife-focused conception of\nhumankind\u2019s \u201cvocation [Bestimmung]\u201d, which\nHerder sharply opposed in favor of a this-worldly conception of the\nsame.\n\nAs was mentioned earlier, Herder in particular holds a sentimentalist\nposition concerning the nature of morality: rather than being a sort\nof knowledge of objective facts (as in Plato\u2019s moral theory, for\nexample) or a set of deliverances of universal reason (as in the\ncritical Kant\u2019s moral theory, for instance), morality is\nfundamentally an expression of human sentiments. Herder already\nespouses such a position in How Philosophy Can Become (1765),\ncontinues it in This Too a Philosophy of History (1774)\n(where he usually refers to the sentiments in question as\nNeigungen, inclinations), and still holds it in Letters\nfor the Advancement (1793\u20137) (where he usually refers to\nthem as Gesinnungen, attitudes).\n\nHerder took over this position from his teacher, the pre-critical\nKant, who had similarly espoused a form of sentimentalism in\nDreams of a Spirit Seer (1766). Via Kant it can ultimately be\ntraced back to the British sentimentalist tradition, especially Hume,\nwhose main argument for it Herder seems to echo at points in This\nToo a Philosophy of History: moral judgment of its very nature\nmotivates; but reason does not motivate, only sentiments do that;\ntherefore moral judgment must fundamentally consist of sentiments.\n\nHowever, Herder\u2019s sentimentalism is not crude or unqualified (as\nHume\u2019s arguably was), for he recognizes that\ncognition\u2014i.e., concepts and beliefs\u2014plays a major role in\nmorality as well. This can already be seen from the Critical\nForests (1769), where he argues against cruder theories of moral\nvalue that equate them with sentiments abstracted from all cognition,\nand where in the fourth part he indeed argues that sensations in\ngeneral are concept-, belief-, and\ntheory-laden. It can also be seen from On the Cognition and\nSensation (1778). (Nietzsche would later take over this more\nsophisticated form of sentimentalism from Herder.)\n\nWhere Herder\u2019s position becomes most original, though, is in\nhistoricizing the moral sentiments in question\u2014or (a\nlittle more broadly and more precisely) in seeing them as varying\ndeeply from one historical period to another, one culture to another,\nand even one individual to another. He already champions such a\nposition in On the Change of Taste (1766), for example,\nindeed going as far as to point out that the moral sentiments in\nquestion sometimes even get inverted, so that what one period,\nculture, or individual found morally praiseworthy another finds\nmorally reprehensible or vice versa. This radical position can also be\nfound in his published writings. This position makes Herder\u2019s\nsentimentalism markedly different from Hume\u2019s, rather a\nprecursor of Nietzsche\u2019s (which it again strongly influenced\nhere).\n\nAnother radical thesis that Herder champions is that moral sentiments\nmoreover as a rule turn out to be both suitable to and explicable in\nterms of the particular type of society and mode of life to which they\nbelong. This is a central thesis in This Too a Philosophy of\nHistory. Thus Herder tries to show there that the moral values of\neach of the major period/cultures that he considers in the work can be\nexplained in terms of their suitability to the character of the\nparticular society and way of life to which they belonged\u2014for\nexample, the ancient Egyptians\u2019 morality of diligence and civic\nfaithfulness to their agricultural, industrial, and urban society and\nmode of life; the Romans\u2019 morality of courage, prudence, and\npatriotism to their imperialistic, war-based society and mode of life;\nand so on. This thesis implicitly reinforces Herder\u2019s Humean\nargument for sentimentalism by showing that moral attitudes are\nexplicable in terms of their social function without recourse to moral\nfacts. (Here again Herder\u2019s approach would later be echoed by\nNietzsche.)\n\nAnother major contribution that Herder makes in the area of\nmeta-ethics is his application of a novel \u201cgenetic\u201d method\nof explanation to the domain of morality. This method depends on\nHerder\u2019s historicism. It purports to make a psychological\nphenomenon more intelligible by tracing it back to its historical\norigins and showing how these developed into it via a series of\nintermediate forms. Herder first developed this method in the\nmid-1760s in application to literary genres and language (in\nAttempt at a History of Lyric Poetry and the\nFragments respectively), but he then went on to apply it to\nmoral (and other) values in This Too a Philosophy of History\n(1774). Since moralities change over time, it is possible to\ncontribute to explaining or better understanding the morality of a\nlate age, for example, eighteenth-century Europe, by identifying the\nearliest morality in its historical tradition and then showing how\nthis developed through a chain of subsequent moralities into the late\nmorality in question. Accordingly, This Too a Philosophy of\nHistory attempts to show (roughly) that after the authoritarian\nmorality of the ancient Hebrews had laid the foundations, the\nEgyptians\u2019 morality of diligence and citizen\u2019s\nfaithfulness arose; this then gave way to the Phoenicians\u2019\nmorality of freedom and openness; the Greeks next synthesized the\npreceding moralities into a morality of citizen\u2019s faithfulness\nand freedom; Rome then modified this inheritance into moral values of\ncourage, prudence, and patriotism; following the collapse of the Roman\nEmpire, the northern tribes, together with Christianity, developed a\nricher set of values that included courage, faith, honesty, reverence\nfor gods, humanity, chastity, and knightly honor; and then finally the\n(professed) morality of modern Europe emerged as a result of this\nwhole tradition. This Herderian approach to explaining, or\ncontributing to a better understanding of, morality would subsequently\nbe taken over and developed further by Hegel (in the early theological\nwritings and the Phenomenology of Spirit [1807]), Nietzsche\n(especially in On the Genealogy of Morality [1887]), and\nFoucault.\n\nA further important aspect of Herder\u2019s meta-ethics has already\nbeen touched on: the complex position that he already develops in\nHow Philosophy Can Become that sentimentalism is the correct\naccount of the nature of morality; that cognitivism is therefore\nuseless as an account of morality or as an approach for inculcating\nit, and is moreover harmful because it provokes skepticism about\nmorality and distracts people from the real foundations of morality\nand from reinforcing them; and that philosophy should therefore\ninstead focus on identifying and reinforcing those real foundations,\nnamely, a set of causal mechanisms that generate and support the moral\nsentiments.\n\nAs was also mentioned earlier, How Philosophy Can Become\nmainly emphasizes certain forms of education and an emotive type of\npreaching in this connection\u2014both activities that Herder went on\nto theorize about at greater length elsewhere. But these are only two\nparts of a much broader theory and practice of moral pedagogy, or\ncultivation of the moral sentiments, that he developed over the course\nof his career, in what became one of his most central, distinctive,\nand consuming projects. The additional causal mechanisms that he\nidentified and supported included the influence of morally exemplary\nindividuals, the law, and literature (together with the other\narts).\n\nHerder\u2019s development of this whole theory and practice of moral\npedagogy was lifelong and tireless. It arguably constitutes the most\nimportant philosophical contribution to moral pedagogy since the\n(strikingly similar) moral pedagogy that Protagoras developed in\nantiquity (as preserved in the Great Discourse of Plato\u2019s\nProtagoras).\n\nAs can be seen from This Too a Philosophy of History, Herder\nbelieved that this project had a special historical urgency in his day\nbecause since the Renaissance and the Reformation the moral values\nthat people profess, such as love of humanity, freedom, and honor,\nhave largely become hollow, no longer genuinely anchored in moral\nsentiments, and therefore fail to serve the social function to which\nthey would correspond.\n\nA final important aspect of Herder\u2019s meta-ethics, prominent\nespecially in This Too a Philosophy of History, flows from\nseveral of the meta-ethical positions that have already been\nmentioned, specifically, from sentimentalism, his thesis of the\nprofound variability of moral sentiments between periods, cultures,\nand even individuals, and his thesis of the general suitedness of the\nvarious moralities that arise to the societies and modes of life to\nwhich they belong: there can be no valid justification for making\ndifferential evaluative comparisons between one morality and another,\nfor saying that one morality is better or worse than another. This is\nthe implication of a famous remark in This Too a Philosophy of\nHistory that where values are concerned\n\n\nat bottom all comparison proves to be problematic \u2026 Each nation\nhas its center of happiness in itself, like every sphere its center of\ngravity! (HPW 296\u2013297)\n\n\nThis relativism (as it has often, and reasonably, been called) is\narguably one of Herder\u2019s most important contributions to moral\nphilosophy. However, it is also problematic, both in its relation to\nother parts of Herder\u2019s philosophy and intrinsically. (For\nfurther details, see Section 2 of the\n Supplementary Discussion.)\n\nLet us now turn more briefly to some of Herder\u2019s distinctive\npositions in first-order morality. For at this level too he developed\npositions that are of great importance\u2014for their intrinsic\nvalue, their influence on successors, or both.\n\nOne very fundamental, original, and attractive principle that he\ndevelops here is what might be called pluralist\ncosmopolitanism, in contradistinction to the homogenizing\ncosmopolitanism of the tradition. Cosmopolitanism already had a\nlong history by Herder\u2019s day that reached back to (Cynicism and)\nStoicism in the pagan Greek world. That tradition had usually\nchampioned a homogenizing form of cosmopolitanism, i.e., a form of it\nthat grants equal ethical respect to all human beings only on the\nbasis of an assumption that they all share much in common\npsychologically, especially in their moral values. In particular,\nHerder\u2019s Enlightenment predecessors, including Kant, had held\nsuch a position. Moreover, this version of cosmopolitanism continues\nto be predominant among moral philosophers and worthy organizations\nsuch as the United Nations to this day. There is a huge problem with\nthis form of cosmopolitanism, however: its assumption that human\nbeings all share a great deal in common psychologically, especially in\nmoral values, is false (and attempting to make it\ntrue would require massive coercion). Herder recognized this problem,\nbut he did not throw out the baby of cosmopolitanism with the\nbathwater of homogenization. Instead, he developed a distinctive\npluralist form of cosmopolitanism: a commitment to equal\nmoral respect for all human beings despite, or even in part\nbecause of, the diversity of their psychologies, and in\nparticular their moral values. This position is prominent in the\nLetters for the Advancement, for example. It also undergirds\nHerder\u2019s strong stance against imperialism and colonialism in\nThis Too a Philosophy of History, the Ideas, and the\nLetters for the Advancement.\n\nA second moral principle of Herder\u2019s that deserves mention here\nis the closely related principle of humanity\n[Humanit\u00e4t], which he develops in the Ideas and\nthe Letters for the Advancement. This principle has both\ndescriptive and normative aspects. Descriptively, it includes an\nimplication of the unity of the human species and of the mere\nsuperficiality of racial differences. Normatively, it includes an\nimplication of cosmopolitanism; implications of specific standards of\ndecent treatment (e.g., not killing, physically abusing, or deceiving\npeople); and also functions as a sort of substitute for the ideal of\nhuman rights, an ideal that constitutes a closer\nspecification of cosmopolitanism but which Herder tends to shy away\nfrom for various reasons (see for this the section on Political\nPhilosophy).\n\nHerder\u2019s principle of humanity takes two distinguishable forms:\nan early form for which he normally uses the term Menschheit,\nfound especially in This Too a Philosophy of History, and a\nlater form for which he usually uses the term Humanit\u00e4t,\nfound especially in the Ideas and the Letters for the\nAdvancement. These versions differ not only terminologically but\nalso substantively, in that, for example, the later version tends\ntoward a more cognitive and universalistic conception of moral value\nthan the earlier one. It can be argued that Herder\u2019s earlier\nversion was the actually the more original and philosophically deeper\nof the two.\n\nA further noteworthy component of Herder\u2019s first-order morality\nis his moral ideal of Bildung, in the sense of an autonomous,\nindividualistic development of all one\u2019s capacities into a\nharmonious whole. He already worked out this ideal in writings from\n1769 such as his Journal. Later, in On the Cognition and\nSensation, he developed some deeper philosophical foundations for\nit: an account of human autonomy or freedom as something quite\ncompatible with the laws of nature (an account closely related to one\nthat he had already worked out in the Treatise on the Origin\naccording to which a distinctive characteristic of humankind lies in a\ncertain sort of flexibility, or freedom from determination by narrow\ninstincts); a quasi-Leibnizian account of individuality as a general\nfeature of all nature, including human nature as a special\ncase; and an account of the deep interdependence of human\nbeings\u2019 psychological faculties, which undergirds the\n\u201charmonious whole\u201d component of the ideal. This ideal\nwould later go on to have an enormous influence on successors such as\nSchiller, Wilhelm von Humboldt (who saw its realization as the highest\npurpose of the state or even the whole universe), and Hegel.\n\nIn addition to these striking moral ideals, Herder is also committed\nto a range of much less surprising ones, especially ones associated\nwith the Christian moral tradition, such as sympathy, love,\nforgiveness, honesty, justice, and equality. Although not surprising\nin themselves, these ideals help to illustrate another striking\nfeature of his moral philosophy: his firm avoidance of the sort of\nmoral monism that began in antiquity with Plato\u2019s\nProtagoras (specifically, with its argument for the unity of\nthe virtues) and which has continued in modernity with Kant (in his\ncommitment to the categorical imperative as the sole moral principle)\nand Utilitarianism (with its commitment to happiness as the sole moral\ncriterion), in favor of moral pluralism, or a commitment to\nan irreducible plurality of moral values/ideals. This is arguably\nanother great merit of his moral philosophy.\n\nFinally, Herder\u2019s ethical theory is important not only for what\nit includes but also for what it excludes. In particular, he shows\nlittle interest in the issue of free will, rarely if ever implying\nthat such a thing exists or that it is a precondition of moral\nresponsibility. (Freedom in the sense of a sort of autonomy,\nor flexibility, that exists within the limits of the laws of\nnature and merely amounts to a certain liberty from constraint by\nnarrow instincts and political freedom are another matter; he\nis interested in these.) This position contrasts sharply with\nthat of most modern moral philosophers, including both Hume and Kant,\nfor example. However, it looks much less idiosyncratic if one takes a\nbroader perspective and notices, for instance, that neither the early\nGreeks (e.g., Homer) nor the Chinese ethical tradition have had any\nconception of free will or any inclination to think that such a thing\nis required for moral responsibility. Indeed, I would argue that\nHerder\u2019s position here, like that of those other traditions,\nturns out to be a great virtue, since the very conception of free will\nand of morality\u2019s dependence on it, which has dominated western\nphilosophy and religion since late antiquity, turns out to be\nmisbegotten.\n",
