    "main_text": "New Logical Calculi || From Axioms to Rules: Natural Reasoning\n2.1 From Axioms to Rules: Natural Reasoning \n\nAs we noted above, Gentzen had already begun in 1931 to be concerned\nwith the consistency of full elementary number theory. As the logical\nframework he used, what we now call, natural deduction calculi. They\nevolved from an axiomatic calculus that had been used by Hilbert and\nBernays since 1922 and introduced an important modification of the\ncalculus for sentential logic. The connectives \\(\\land \\) and \\(\\lor\\)\nare incorporated, and the axioms for these connectives are as follows:\n \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\nA\\land B & \\to A           \\\\\n                  A\\land B & \\to B \\\\\nA & \\to (B \\to A\\land B)  \\\\\nA & \\to  A\\lor B              \\\\\n          B & \\to A\\lor B \\\\\n(A \\to C) & \\to ((B \\to C) \\to (A\\lor B \\to C))\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nHilbert and Bernays introduced this new logical formalism for two\nreasons, (i) to be able to better and more easily formalize\nmathematics, and (ii) to bring out the understanding of logical\nconnectives in methodological parallel to the treatment of geometric\nconcepts in Foundations of geometry. The methodological\nadvantages of this calculus are discussed in Bernays 1927: 10:\n\n\nThe starting formulae can be chosen in quite different ways. A great\ndeal of effort has been spent, in particular, to get by with a minimal\nnumber of axioms, and the limit of what is possible has indeed been\nreached. However, for the purposes of logical investigations it is\nbetter to separate out, in line with the axiomatic procedure for\ngeometry, different axiom groups in such a way that each of them\nexpresses the role of a single logical operation.\n\n\nThen Bernays lists four groups, namely, axioms for the conditional\n\\(\\to\\), for \\(\\land \\) and \\(\\lor\\) as above, and for negation\n\\(\\neg\\). The axioms for the conditional are not only reflecting\nlogical properties, but also structural features as in the later\nsequent calculus (and in Frege\u2019s Begriffsschrift,\n1879).  \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\nA & \\to (B \\to A)\\\\\n(A \\to (A \\to B)) & \\to (A \\to B)\\\\\n(A \\to (B \\to C)) & \\to (B \\to (A \\to C))\\\\\n(B \\to C) & \\to ((A \\to B) \\to (A \\to C))\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nAs axioms for negation one can choose:  \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\nA & \\to (\\neg A \\to B)\\\\\n(A \\to B) & \\to ((\\neg A \\to B) \\to B)\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nHilbert formulates this logical system in \u00dcber das\nUnendliche and in his second Hamburg talk of 1927, but gives a\nslightly different formulation of the axioms for negation, calling\nthem the principle of contradiction and the principle of\ndouble negation:  \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n(A \\to (B \\land  \\neg B)) &\\to \\neg A\\\\\n\\neg\\neg A & \\to A\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nClearly, the axioms correspond directly to the natural deduction rules\nfor these connectives, and one finds here the origin of\nGentzen\u2019s natural deduction calculi. Bernays had investigated in\nhis Habilitationsschrift (1918) rule based calculi. However,\nin the given context, the simplicity of the metamathematical\ndescription of calculi seemed paramount, and in Bernays 1927 (p. 17)\none finds the programmatic remark: \u201cWe want to have as few rules\nas possible, rather put much into axioms\u201d.\n\nGentzen was led to a rule-based calculus with introduction\nand elimination rules for every logical connective. The truly\ndistinctive feature of this new type of calculus was for Gentzen,\nhowever, making and discharging assumptions. This feature, he\nremarked, most directly reflects a crucial aspect of mathematical\n argumentation.[12]\n Here we formulate the distinctive rules that involve contradictions\nand go beyond minimal logic that has I- and E-rules for all logical\nconnectives. Intuitionist logic is obtained from minimal logic by\nadding the rule: from \\(\\perp\\) infer any formula A, i.e.,\nex falso quodlibet. In the case of classical logic, if a\nproof of \\(\\perp\\) is obtained from the assumption \\(\\neg A\\), then\ninfer A (and cancel the assumption \\(\\neg A\\)). Gentzen\ndiscovered a remarkable fact for the intuitionist calculus, having\nobserved that proofs can have peculiar detours of the\nfollowing form: a formula is obtained by an I-rule and is then the\nmajor premise of the corresponding E-rule. For conjunction such a\ndetour is depicted as follows:  \n\n\\[\n\\cfrac{\\begin{array}{c}\\vdots \\\\ A\\end{array} \\quad \\begin{array}{c}\\vdots \\\\ B\\end{array}}\n{\\cfrac{A\\land  B}{B}}\n\\]\n\n\nClearly, a proof of B is already contained in the given\nderivation. Proofs without detours are called normal, and\nGentzen showed that any proof can be effectively transformed via\n\u201creduction steps\u201d into a normal one.\n\n\nTheorem 2.1 (Normalization for intuitionist\nlogic) A proof of A from a set of assumptions \\(\\Gamma\\)\ncan be transformed into a normal proof of A from the same set\nof assumptions.\n\n\nFocusing on normal proofs, Gentzen proved then that the complexity of\nformulae in such proofs can be bounded by that of assumptions and\nconclusion.\n\n\nCorollary 2.2 (Subformula property) If\n\\(\\cD\\) is a normal proof of A from \\(\\Gamma\\), then every\nformula in \\(\\cD\\) is either a subformula of an element \\(\\Gamma\\) or\nof A.\n\n\nAs Gentzen recounts matters at the very beginning of his dissertation\n(1934/35), he was led by the\ninvestigation of the natural calculus to his\n Hauptsatz[13]\n when he could not extend the considerations to classical logic.\n\n\nTo be able to formulate it [the Hauptsatz] in a direct way, I\nhad to base it on a particularly suitable logical calculus. The\ncalculus of natural deduction turned out not to be appropriate for\nthat purpose.\n\n\nSo, Gentzen focused his attention on sequent calculi that had been\nintroduced by Paul Hertz and which had been the subject of\nGentzen\u2019s first scientific paper (1932).\n",
