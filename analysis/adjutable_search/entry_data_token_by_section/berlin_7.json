    "main_text": "Ethical Thought and Value Pluralism\n4. Ethical Thought and Value Pluralism\n\nThe republication of Berlin\u2019s numerous essays in thematic\ncollections, beginning with Four Essays on Liberty (1969) and\nVico and Herder (1976), and continuing at an increased pace\nfrom 1978 under the general (and mostly specific) editorship of Henry\nHardy, served to highlight as a central dimension of Berlin\u2019s\nthought his advocacy of the doctrine of value pluralism (which he\nhimself called \u2018pluralism\u2019). Increasingly from the early\n1990s value pluralism has come to be seen by many as Berlin\u2019s\n\u2018master idea\u2019, and has become the most discussed, most\nadmired and most controversial of his ideas.\n\nValue pluralism was indeed at the centre of Berlin\u2019s ethical\nthought; but there is more to that thought than value pluralism alone.\nBerlin defined ethical thought as \u2018the systematic examination of\nthe relations of human beings to one another, the conceptions,\ninterests and ideals from which human ways of treating one another\nspring, and the systems of value on which such ends of life are\nbased\u2019. These systems of value are \u2018beliefs about how life\nshould be lived, what men and women should be and do\u2019 (1990,\n1\u20132). Just as Berlin\u2019s conception of philosophy was based\non a belief about the important role of concepts and categories in\npeople\u2019s lives, his conception of ethics was founded on his\nbelief in the importance of normative or ethical concepts and\ncategories \u2013 especially\n values.[15]\n\nBerlin did not set out a systematic theory about the nature of values,\nand so his view must be gleaned from his writings on the history of\nideas. His remarks on the status and origins of values are ambiguous,\nthough not necessarily irreconcilable with one another. He seems,\nfirst, to endorse the Romantic view \u2013 which he traces to Kant\n(although he also sometimes attributes it to Hume) \u2013 that values\nare not discovered \u2018out there\u2019, as\n\u2018ingredients\u2019 in the universe, not deduced or derived from\nnature. Rather, they are human creations, and derive their authority\nfrom this fact. From this followed a theory of ethics according to\nwhich individual human beings are the most morally valuable things, so\nthat the worth of ideals and actions should be judged in relation to\nthe meanings and impact they have for and on such individuals. This\nview underlay Berlin\u2019s passionate conviction of the error of\nlooking to theories rather than human realities, of the evil of\nsacrificing living human beings to abstractions (which he found\nemphasised in Herzen); it also related to Berlin\u2019s theory of\nliberty, and his belief in liberty\u2019s special importance.\n\nAt other times Berlin seems to advance what amounts almost to a theory\nof natural law, albeit in minimalist, empirical dress. In such cases\nhe suggests that there are certain unvarying features of human beings,\nas they have been constituted throughout recorded history, that make\ncertain values important, or even necessary, to them. Values, then,\nwould be beliefs about what it is good to be and do \u2013 about what\nsort of life, what sort of character, what sort of actions, what state\nof being it is desirable, given human nature, for us to aspire to.\nThis view of the origin of values also comes into play in\nBerlin\u2019s defence of the value of liberty, when he suggests that\nthe freedom to think, to enquire, to imagine, and above all to choose,\nwithout constraint or fear, is valuable because human beings need such\nmental freedom; to deny it to them is a denial of their nature,\nimposes an intolerable burden, and at the extreme entirely dehumanises\nthem.\n\nIn an attempt to reconcile these two strands, one might say that, for\nBerlin, the values that humans create are rooted in the nature of the\nbeings who pursue them. But this is simply to move the question back a\nstep, for the question then immediately arises: Is this human nature\nnatural and fixed, or created and altered over time through conscious\nor unconscious human action? Berlin\u2019s answer (see e.g. 1990,\n319\u201323) comes in two parts. He rejects the idea of a fixed,\nfully specified human nature, regarding natural essences with\nsuspicion. Yet he does believe (however under-theorised, unsystematic\nand undogmatic this belief may be) in boundaries to, and requirements\nmade by, human nature as we know it. This common human nature may not\nbe fully specifiable in terms of a list of unvarying characteristics;\nbut, while many characteristics may vary from individual to individual\nor culture to culture, there is a limit on the variation \u2013 just\nas the human face may vary greatly from person to person in many of\nits properties, while remaining recognisably human, but at the same\ntime it is possible to distinguish between a human and a non-human\nface, even if the difference between them cannot be reduced to a\nformula. Indeed, at the core of Berlin\u2019s thought was his\ninsistence on the importance of humanity, or the distinctively human,\nboth as a quasi-Kantian category and as a moral reality, which does\nnot need to be reduced to an unvarying essence in order to have\ndescriptive and normative force.\n\nThere is a related ambiguity about whether values are objective or\nsubjective. One might conclude from Berlin\u2019s view of values as\nhuman inventions that he would regard them as subjective. Yet he\ninsisted, on the contrary, that values are objective, even going so\nfar as to label his position \u2018objective pluralism\u2019 (2015,\n210; 2000b, 245, note 1). Yet it is unclear what exactly he meant by\nthis, or how this belief relates to his view of values as human\ncreations. There are at least two accounts of the objectivity of\nvalues that can be plausibly attributed to Berlin. The first is that\nvalues are \u2018objective\u2019 in that they are simply facts about\nthe people who hold them \u2013 so that, for instance, liberty is an\n\u2018objective\u2019 value because I value it, and would feel\nfrustrated and miserable without at any rate a minimal amount of it.\nThe second is that the belief in or pursuit of certain values is the\nresult of objective realities of human nature \u2013 so that, for\ninstance, liberty is an \u2018objective\u2019 value because certain\nfacts about human nature make liberty good and desirable for human\nbeings. These views are not incompatible with one another, but they\nare distinct; and the latter provides a firmer basis for the minimal\nmoral universalism that Berlin espoused.\n\nFinally, Berlin insisted that each value is binding on human beings by\nvirtue of its own claims, in its own terms, and not in terms of some\nother value or goal, let alone the same value in all cases. This view\nwas one of the central tenets of Berlin\u2019s pluralism.\n",
