    "preamble": "\n\nCharles Hartshorne (pronounced Harts-horne) is considered by many\nphilosophers to be one of the most important philosophers of religion\nand metaphysicians of the twentieth century. Although Hartshorne often\ncriticized the metaphysics of substance found in medieval philosophy,\nhe was very much like medieval thinkers in developing a philosophy\nthat was theocentric. Throughout his career he defended the\nrationality of theism and for several decades was almost alone in\ndoing so among English-language philosophers. Hartshorne was also one\nof the thinkers responsible for the rediscovery of St. Anselm\u2019s\nontological argument. But his most influential contribution to\nphilosophical theism did not concern arguments for the\nexistence of God, but rather was related to a theory of the\nactuality of God, i.e., how God exists. In\ntraditional or classical theism, God was seen as the supreme,\nunchanging being, but in Hartshorne\u2019s process-based or\nneoclassical conception, God is seen as supreme becoming in which\nthere is a factor of supreme being. That is, we humans change for a\nwhile, whereas God always changes, Hartshorne maintains. The\nneoclassical view of Hartshorne has influenced the way many\nphilosophers understand the concept of God. In fact, a small number of\nscholars\u2014some philosophers and some theologians\u2014think of\nhim as the greatest metaphysician of the second half of the twentieth\ncentury, yet, with a few exceptions to be treated below, his work has\nhad limited influence\u00a0among analytic philosophers who are\ntheists.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Life\n\nCharles Hartshorne was born in the nineteenth century and lived to\nphilosophize in the twenty-first. He was born in Kittanning,\nPennsylvania (U.S.A.) on June 5, 1897. He was, like Alfred North\nWhitehead, the son of an Anglican minister, although many of his\nancestors were Quakers. After attending Haverford College he served in\nWorld War One in France as a medic, taking a box of philosophy books\nwith him to the front. After the war Hartshorne received his\nbachelor\u2019s degree and doctorate in philosophy at Harvard, and there he\nmet Whitehead. Most of the major elements of Hartshorne\u2019s\nphilosophy were already apparent by the time he became familiar with\nWhitehead\u2019s thought, contrary to a popular misconception. From\n1923\u20131925 a postdoctoral fellowship took him to Germany, where\nhe had classes with both Husserl and Heidegger. But neither of these\nthinkers influenced his philosophy as much as C.S. Peirce, whose\ncollected papers he edited with Paul Weiss. In addition to many\nvisiting appointments, Hartshorne spent his teaching career at three\ninstitutions. From 1928\u20131955 he taught at the University of\nChicago, where he was a dominant intellectual force in the School of\nDivinity, despite the fact that he was housed in the Philosophy\nDepartment, where he was not nearly as influential. He was at Emory\nUniversity from 1955 until 1962, when he moved to the University of\nTexas at Austin. Hartshorne eventually became a long-term emeritus\nprofessor at Austin and lived there until his death on October 9,\n2000. His wife, Dorothy, was as colorful as her husband and was\nmentioned often in his writings. Hartshorne never owned an automobile,\nnor did he smoke or drink alcohol or caffeine; he had a passion for\nbirdsong and became an internationally known expert in the field.\n2. Method\n\nThree primary methodological devices or procedures are at work in\nHartshorne\u2019s metaphysics. First, he very often uses a systematic\nexhaustion of theoretical options\u2014or the development of position\nmatrices, sometimes containing thirty-two alternatives(!)\u2014in\nconsidering philosophical problems. This procedure is evident\nthroughout his philosophy, but it is most apparent in his various\ntreatments of the ontological argument. To take another example, he\nthinks it important to notice that regarding the mind-body problem\nthere are three options available to us, not two, as is usually\nassumed: some form of dualism, some form of the materialist view that\npsyche is reducible to body, and some form of the panpsychist\n(or, as he terms it, psychicalist) view that body is in some way\nreducible to psyche if all concrete singulars (e.g., cells or\nelectrons) in some way show signs of self-motion or activity. Thomas\nNagel famously considers this third option, but Hartshorne actually\ndefends it. The recent surge of interest in panpsychism indicates that\nHartshorne was ahead of his time by several decades in his ideas in\nphilosophy of mind.\n\nSecond, Hartshorne frequently uses the history of philosophy to see\nwhich of the logically possible options made available by position\nmatrices have been defended before so as to avail ourselves of the\ninsights of others in the effort to examine in detail the consistency\nof these positions and to assess their consequences. Nonetheless,\nthose logically possible options that have not historically found\nsupport should be analyzed both in terms of internal consistency and\npractical ramifications. It should be noted that Hartshorne\u2019s\nuse of the history of philosophy often involves lesser known views of\nfamous thinkers (like Plato\u2019s belief in God as the soul for the\nbody of the whole natural world, or Leibniz\u2019s defense of\npanpsychism) as well as the thought of lesser known thinkers (such as\nFaustus Socinus, Nicholas Berdyaev, Mohammed Iqbal, or Jules\nLecquier).\n\nThird, after a careful reading of the history of philosophy has\nfacilitated the conceptual and pragmatic examination of all the\navailable options made explicit by a position matrix, the (Greek)\nprinciple of moderation is used by Hartshorne as a guide to negotiate\nthe way between extreme views on either side. For example, regarding\nthe issue of personal identity, the view of Hume (and of Bertrand\nRussell at one stage in his career) is that, strictly speaking, there\nis no personal identity in that each event in \u201ca person\u2019s\nlife\u201d is externally related to the others. This is just as\ndisastrous, Hartshorne thinks, as Leibniz\u2019s view that all such\nevents are internally related to the others, so that implicit in the\nfetus are all the experiences of the adult. (This Leibnizian view\nrelies on the classical theistic, strong notion of omniscience,\nwherein God knows in minute detail and with absolute assurance what\nwill happen in the future.) The Humean view fails to explain the\ncontinuity we experience in our lives and the Leibnizian view fails to\nexplain the indeterminateness we experience when considering the\nfuture. The truth lies between these two extremes, Hartshorne thinks.\nHis view of personal identity is based on a conception of time as\nasymmetrical in which later events in a person\u2019s life are\ninternally related to former events, but they are externally related\nto those that follow, thus leading to a position that is at once\npartially deterministic and partially indeterministic. That is, the\npast supplies necessary but not sufficient conditions for human\nidentity in the present, which always faces a partially indeterminate\nfuture.\n\nOnly the first of these methodological devices or procedures supports\nthe widely held claim that Hartshorne is a rationalist. His overall\nmethod is a complex one that involves the other two methods or\nprocedures, where he does borrow from the rationalists, but also from\nthe pragmatists and the Greeks. It must be admitted, however, that\nHartshorne was educated in a philosophic world still heavily\ninfluenced by late nineteenth and early twentieth century\nidealism.\n3. The Existence and Actuality of God\n\nPhilosophers commonly use a metaphor that suggests that the chain of\nan argument, say for the existence of God, is only as strong as its\nweakest link. Hartshorne rejects this metaphor on Peircian grounds. He\nreplaces it by suggesting that various arguments for the existence of\nGod\u2014ontological, cosmological, design, etc.\u2014are like\nmutually reinforcing strands in a cable, as detailed by the Hartshorne\nscholar Donald Viney.\n\nHe argues that Hume\u2019s and Kant\u2019s criticisms of the\nontological argument of St. Anselm are not directed at the strongest\nversion of his argument found in Proslogion, chapter 3. Here,\nhe thinks, there is a modal distinction implied between existing\nnecessarily and existing contingently. Hartshorne\u2019s view is that\nexistence alone might not be a real predicate, but existing\nnecessarily certainly is. To say that something exists without the\npossibility of not existing is to say something significant about the\nbeing in question. That is, contra Kant and others, Hartshorne\nbelieves that there are necessary truths concerning existence. To say\nthat absolute nonexistence in some fashion exists is to contradict\noneself; hence he thinks that absolute nonexistence is unintelligible.\nIt is necessarily the case that something exists, he thinks,\nand, relying on the ontological argument, he also thinks it true that\nGod necessarily exists.\n\nOn Hartshorne\u2019s view, metaphysics does not deal with realities\nbeyond the physical, but rather with those features of reality that\nare ubiquitous or that would exist in any possible world. And he does\nnot think that it is possible to think of a preeminent being that\nexisted only contingently since if it did exist contingently rather\nthan necessarily, it would not be preeminent. That is, God\u2019s\nexistence is either impossible (positivism) or possible, and, if\npossible, then necessary (theism). He is assuming here that there are\nthree alternatives for us to consider: (1) God is impossible; (2) God\nis possible, but may or may not exist; (3) God exists necessarily. The\nontological argument shows that the second alternative makes no sense.\nHence, he thinks that the prime task for the philosophical theist is\nto show that God is not impossible. A Hartshornian version of the\nontological argument can be put as follows: (1) Even if Kant was\ncorrect that existence is not a predicate, modality of existence is a\npredicate in the sense that saying that X exists necessarily or\ncontingently or impossibly, rather than merely saying that X exists,\nis to say something or to predicate something significant about X. (2)\nThere are three (and only three) modes of existence: (a) impossible\n(cannot exist); (b) contingent (may or may not exist--i.e., being such\nthat it exists but might not or being such that it does not exist but\nmight); and (c) necessary (must exist). (3) To say that God exists\ncontingently (as in 2b) is to contradict the logic of perfection\n(which is Anselm\u2019s great discovery) because a being that existed\nonly contingently would not be the greatest conceivable. (4)\nTherefore, the existence of God--the greatest conceivable being or a\nperfect being--is either impossible or necessary (preliminary\nconclusion). (5) The existence of God is not impossible (which is the\nconclusion from other theistic arguments and from the history of\nreligious experience). (6) Therefore, the existence of God is\nnecessary; or, at the very least, the nonexistence of God is\ninconceivable (ultimate conclusion). Hartshorne also offered a version\nof the argument in formal logic (perhaps the very first to do so).\n\n\nIn addition, Hartshorne\u2019s detailed treatment of the argument\nfrom design is connected to his view of biology. It is hard to\nreconcile the idea of an omnipotent, classical theistic God with the\nfact of the monstrosities and chance mutations produced in nature, but\nthe general orderliness of the natural world is just as difficult to\nreconcile with there being no Orderer or Persuader at all. Belief in\nGod as omnipotent, he thinks, has three problems: (1) it is at odds\nwith the disorderliness in nature; (2) it yields the acutest form of\nthe theodicy problem; and (3) it conflicts with the notion from\nPlato\u2019s Sophist, defended by Hartshorne, that being\nis dynamic power (dynamis). An omnipotent\nbeing would ultimately have all power over others, who would\nultimately be powerless. But any being-in-becoming, according to\nHartshorne, has some power to be affected by others and to\naffect others; this power, however slight, provides counterevidence to\na belief in divine omnipotence. In contrast, God is ideally powerful,\non the Hartshornian view. That is, God is as powerful as it is\npossible to be, given the partial freedom and power of creatures.\n\nHartshorne\u2019s dispute with traditional or classical philosophical\ntheism concerns not so much the existence of God, but rather\nits assumption that the actuality of God (i.e., how\nGod exists) could be described in the same terms as the existence of\nGod. A God who exists necessarily is not necessary or unchanging in\nevery other respect (e.g., in terms of divine responsiveness to\ncreaturely changes), he thinks. Although Hartshorne believes that the\nmedieval thinkers were correct in trying to think through the logic of\nperfection, he also thinks that this logic has traditionally been\nmisapplied in the effort to articulate the attributes of a being\ncalled \u201cGod,\u201d roughly defined as the greatest conceivable\nbeing. The traditional or classical theistic logic of perfection sees\nGod as monopolar in that regarding various contrasts\n(permanence-change, one-many, activity-passivity, etc.) the\ntraditional or classical philosophical theist has chosen one element\nin each pair as a divine attribute (the former element of each pair)\nand denigrated the other.\n\nBy way of contrast, Hartshorne\u2019s logic of perfection is dipolar.\nWithin each element of these pairs there are good features that should\nbe attributed in the preeminent sense to God (e.g., excellent\npermanence in the sense of steadfastness, excellent change in the\nsense of preeminent ability to respond to the sufferings of\ncreatures). In each element in these pairs there are also invidious\nfeatures (e.g., pigheaded stubbornness, fickleness). The task for the\nphilosophical theist, he thinks, is to attribute the excellences of\nboth elements of these pairs to God and to eschew the invidious\naspects of both elements. However, it should be noted that\nsome contrasts are not fit for dipolar analysis (e.g.,\ngood-evil) in that \u201cgood good\u201d is a redundancy and\n\u201cevil good\u201d is a contradiction. The greatest conceivable\nbeing, he thinks, cannot be evil in any sense whatsoever.\n\nHartshorne does not claim to believe in two gods, nor does he wish to\ndefend a cosmological dualism. In fact, we can see that the opposite\nis the case when we consider that, in addition to calling his theism\ndipolar, he refers to it as a type of panentheism,\nwhich literally means that all is in the one God. This\ninclusion of the world in God occurs by means of omniscience (as\nHartshorne defines the term) and omnibenevolence. All creaturely\nfeelings, especially feelings of suffering, are included in the divine\nlife. God is seen by Hartshorne as the mind or soul for the whole body\nof the natural world (see above regarding Plato\u2019s World Soul),\nalthough he thinks of God as distinguishable from the creatures.\nAnother way to categorize Hartshorne\u2019s theism is to see it as\nneoclassical in the sense that he relies on the classical or\ntraditional theistic arguments for the existence of God and on the\nclassical theistic metaphysics of being as first steps in the\neffort to think through properly the logic of perfection. However,\nthese efforts need to be supplemented, he thinks, by the efforts of\nthose who see becoming as more inclusive than being. God is not\noutside of time, as in the Boethian view that is influential among\ntraditional philosophical theists, but rather exists through all of\ntime, on Hartshorne\u2019s view. On the neoclassical view,\nGod\u2019s permanent \u201cbeing\u201d consists in steadfast\nbenevolence exhibited through everlasting becoming.\n\nGod is omniscient, on Hartshorne\u2019s view, but\n\u201comniscience\u201d here refers to the divine ability to know\neverything that is knowable: past actualities as already actualized;\npresent realities to the extent that they are knowable according to\nthe laws of physics (e.g., what is present epistemically may very well\nbe the most recent past, given the speed of light); and future\npossibilities or probabilities as possibilities or\nprobabilities. On the traditional or classical conception of\nomniscience, however, God has knowledge of future possibilities or\nprobabilities as already actualized. According to Hartshorne, this is\nnot an example of supreme knowledge, but is rather an example of\nignorance of the (at least partially) indeterminate character of the\nfuture.\n\nThe asymmetrical view of time, common to process thinkers in general\n(e.g., Bergson, Whitehead, Hartshorne), in which the relationship\nbetween the present and the past is radically different from the\nrelationship between the present and the future, also has implications\nfor Hartshorne\u2019s theodicy. A plurality of partially free agents,\nincluding nonhuman ones, facing a future that is neither completely\ndetermined nor foreknown in detail, makes it not only possible, but\nlikely, that these agents will get in each other\u2019s way, clash,\nand cause each other to suffer. On this view, God is the fellow\nsufferer who understands.\n4. Axiology\n\nHartshorne views the cosmos as a \u201cmetaphysical monarchy,\u201d\nwith God as the presiding, but not omnipotent, head, and he sees human\nsociety as a \u201cmetaphysical democracy,\u201d with each member as\nan equal. This makes him a liberal in politics if\n\u201cliberalism\u201d refers to the egalitarian belief that none of\nus is God. That is, due to the fact of pervasive pluralism of\ncomprehensive doctrines that citizens affirm, none of us should\npresume to act like the classical theistic God by unreasonably\nimposing our view of the world on others. Although Hartshorne and\nWhitehead are both political liberals, Hartshorne is, despite his view\nof panpsychist reality as thoroughly social, more of a libertarian\nliberal and Whitehead more of a redistributive liberal. In axiology as\nwell as in metaphysics/theodicy, freedom is crucial, on\nHartshorne\u2019s view.\n\nHartshorne\u2019s panpsychism (or psychicalism) entails the belief\nthat each active singular in nature, even those like electrons and\nplant cells that exhibit feeling if not\u00a0mentality, is nonetheless\na center of intrinsic, and not merely instrumental, value. As a\nresult, Hartshorne\u2019s metaphysics is meant to provide a basis for\nboth an aesthetic appreciation of the value in nature, as well as for\nan environmental ethics where intrinsic and instrumental values in\nnature are weighed. In fact, Hartshorne was one of the first\nphilosophers to write in detail on topics in environmental ethics.\n\nAs a published expert on bird song, Hartshorne is the first\nphilosopher since Aristotle to be an expert in both metaphysics and\nornithology. He writes specifically of the aesthetic categories\nrequired to explain why birds sing outside of mating season and when\nterritory is not threatened\u2014two occasions for bird song that are\ncrucial to the behaviorists\u2019 account. Birds like to\nsing, he concludes. His discovery of the \u201cmonotony threshold\u201d\nregarding bird song is still cited by ornithologists.\nHartshorne\u2019s ornithology thus serves to highlight the crucial\nrole that aesthetic categories play in Hartshorne\u2019s philosophy\n(from the ancient Greek word for feeling: aesthesis), from\nthe minuscule feelings of microscopic reality to divine feelings.\n\nHartshorne\u2019s criticism of anthropocentrism is due not only to\nhis concern for God, but also for beings-in-becoming who experience in\na less sophisticated way than humans. To say that all active singulars\nfeel\u2014leaving out of the picture abstractions like\n\u201ctwoness\u201d or insentient composites of active singulars\nthat do not themselves feel as wholes\u2014is not to say that they\nare self-conscious or that they think. As before, however,\nHartshorne\u2019s axiology is ultimately theocentric in\ncharacter.\n5. Critical Evaluation\n\nIt seems fair to say that analytic philosophers, in general, even\nanalytic philosophers who are theists, have largely ignored\nHartshorne\u2019s philosophy. (The point is debateable. There has\nbeen a move among many analytic philosophers who are theists, as in\nRichard Swinburne, away from the eternal, Boethian God who is outside\nof time altogether. Might it be that Hartshorne\u2019s influence is\ngreater than initially appears to be the case when the temporality, or\nthe sempiternity, of the God of many analytic philosophers is\nconcerned?) This is in contrast to his wide influence among\ntheologians, which is odd when it is considered that he is not a\ntheologian and does not rely on sacred scripture or religious\nauthority for his insights. Another oddity is the fact that\nHartshorne\u2019s influence among theologians is due to the defense\nhe offers of the rationality of belief in a neoclassical\nGod.\n\nThere is at least one important philosopher whose work indicates the\nsort of debate that has occurred between Hartshorne and analytic\ntheists, who tend to rely on traditional or classical versions of the\nconcept of God. That is William Alston. There are two reasons why an\nevaluation of Hartshorne\u2019s philosophy is facilitated by a\nconsideration of Alston\u2019s critique. First, Alston is as\nimportant a theist as any among analytic philosophers and his\ncriticisms of Hartshorne\u2019s thought are like those of other\nanalytic philosophers like Thomas Morris, Richard Creel, Michael\nDurrant, and others. And second, Alston is a former student of\nHartshorne\u2019s and is thoroughly familiar with Hartshorne\u2019s\narguments. Alston is a philosopher who is not scandalized by\nHartshorne\u2019s panentheism, nor by his neoclassical theism. But\nAlston thinks that the contrast that Hartshorne draws between his\nneoclassical theism and the classical theism of Thomas Aquinas is too\nsharp.\n\nAlston thinks that Hartshorne presents neoclassical theism and\nclassical theism as complete packages, whereas it would be better to\nbe able to pick and choose among individual items within these\npackages. Alston seeks some sort of rapprochement between Thomism and\nneoclassical theism, a rapprochement that Hartshorne himself would\nlike to bring about to the extent that he is a neoclassical\nthinker, but that is difficult to accomplish to the extent that he is\nneoclassical.\n\nA consideration of ten contrasting attributes will best facilitate an\ninitial understanding of Hartshorne\u2019s view of God. Consider the\nfirst group of attributes treated by Alston.\n\n\n\nCLASSICAL ATTRIBUTES\nNEOCLASSICAL ATTRIBUTES \n\n1. absoluteness (absence of internal relatedness)\n1. relativity (God is internally related to creatures by way of\nknowledge of them and actions toward them) \n\n2. pure actuality (there is no potentiality in God)\n2. potentiality (not everything is actualized that is possible\nfor God) \n\n3. total necessity (every truth about God is necessarily\ntrue)\n3. necessity and contingency (God exists necessarily, but\nvarious things are true of God contingently, e.g., God\u2019s\nknowledge of what is contingent) \n\n4. absolute simplicity\n4. complexity  \n\n\nAlston distinguishes two lines of argument regarding absoluteness and\nrelativity, which he sees as the key contrast. Alston thinks that only\none of these is successful. As indicated in the diagram above, what\nHartshorne means by absoluteness is absence of internal relatedness. A\nrelation is internal to a term of a relation just in case that term\nwould not be exactly as it is if it were not in that relationship.\nHartshorne\u2019s view is that God has internal relations to\ncreatures by way of knowing and acting towards them and receiving\ninfluence from them.\n\nOn Alston\u2019s interpretation, Hartshorne\u2019s first line of\nargument is to say that if the relation of the absolute to the world\nreally fell outside the absolute, then this relation would necessarily\nfall within some further and genuinely single entity that embraced\nboth the absolute and the world and the relations between them. Thus,\nwe must hold, according to Hartshorne, that the God-creature relation\nis internal to God; otherwise we will have to admit that there is\nsomething greater or more inclusive than God. Alston does not find\nthis argument convincing because it includes the claim that God\n\u201ccontains\u201d the world due to the internal relations God has\nwith the world. Alston\u2019s view is that the entity to which a\nrelation is internal contains the terms only in the minimal sense that\nthose terms enter into a description of the entity, but it does not\nfollow from this that those terms are contained in that entity in an\norganic way.\n\nDivine inclusiveness, for Hartshorne, is sometimes like the inclusion\nof thoughts in a mind, but usually it is described as like the\ninclusion of cells within a living body. It is never like the\ninclusion of marbles in a box. The inorganic and insentient character\nof a box is inadequate as a model for divinity, he thinks, and divine\ninclusiveness is never like the inclusion of theorems in a set of\naxioms, as it might be for certain idealists. Divine inclusiveness in\nHartshorne is organic inclusiveness.\n\nHartshorne\u2019s second argument against absoluteness fares much\nbetter, according to Alston. He agrees with Hartshorne\u2019s stance\nregarding the cognitive relation God has with the world; in any case\nof knowledge, the knowledge relation is internal to the subject,\nexternal to the object. When a human being knows something, the fact\nthat she knows it is part of what makes her the concrete being that\nshe is. If she recognizes a certain tree she is different from the\nbeing she might have been if she had not recognized the tree. But the\ntree is unaffected by her recognition. Likewise, according to Alston,\none cannot maintain that God has perfect knowledge of everything\nknowable and still hold that God is not qualified to any degree by\nrelations with other beings.\n\nOne might respond to Alston and Hartshorne on this point by saying\nthat since creatures depend for their existence on God, their\nrelations to God affect them, but not God. Richard Creel\nseems to make this very point. But even if beings other than God\ndepend for their existence on God, it still remains true that if God\nhad created a different world from the one that exists at present,\nthen God would be somewhat different from the way God is at present:\nGod\u2019s knowledge would have been of that world and not\nthis one, according to both Alston and Hartshorne.\n\nAlston\u2019s concessions to Hartshorne\u2019s concept of God extend\nto contrasts 2\u20134. The above argument for the internal\nrelatedness of God (as cognitive subject) to the world presupposes\nthat there are alternative possibilities for God, and if there are\nalternative possibilities for divine knowledge then this implies that\nthere are unrealized potentialities for God. Pure actuality\nand total necessity cannot be defended as divine attributes,\naccording to Alston and Hartshorne. Alston\u2019s version of\nHartshorne\u2019s argument goes as follows:\n\n(1) (a) \u201cGod knows that W exists\u201d entails (b) \u201cW\nexists.\u201d\n\n\n(2) If (a) were necessary, (b) would be necessary.\n\n(3) But (b) is contingent.\n\n(4) Hence (a) is contingent.\n\n\nWe can totally exclude contingency from God only by denying God any\nknowledge of anything contingent, a step that not even traditional or\nclassical theists wish to take. Contrast 4 must also be treated in a\ndipolar way in that the main support for a doctrine of pure divine\nsimplicity is the absence of any unrealized potentialities in God.\n\nIn sum, Alston and Hartshorne agree on contrasts 1\u20134, except for\nthe fact that Hartshorne\u2019s concept of divine inclusiveness, in\ncontrast to Alston\u2019s, is organic in character.\n\nRegarding a second group of attributes, however, Alston and many other\ntheists who are analytic philosophers diverge from Hartshorne rather\nsignificantly:\n\n\n\nCLASSICAL ATTRIBUTES\nNEOCLASSICAL ATTRIBUTES \n\n5. creation ex nihilo by a free act of will; God could\nhave refrained from creating anything\n5. both God and the world of creatures exist necessarily,\nalthough the details are contingent \n\n6. omnipotence (God has the power to do anything God wills to do\nthat is logically consistent)\n6. God has all the power one agent could have given\nmetaphysical, in addition to logical, limitations \n\n7. incorporeality\n7. corporeality (the world is the body of God) \n\n8. nontemporality (God does not live through a series of\nmoments)\n8. temporality (God lives through temporal succession, but\neverlastingly) \n\n9. immutability (God cannot change because God is not temporally\nsuccessive)\n9. mutability (God is continually attaining richer syntheses of\nexperience) \n\n10. absolute perfection (God is eternally that than which no\nmore perfect can be conceived)\n10. relative perfection (at any moment God is more perfect than\nany other, but God is self-surpassing at a later stage of\ndevelopment)  \n\n\nConcerning contrast 5, Alston takes creation ex nihilo to be\nfundamental to theism because it has deep roots in religious\nexperience. He thinks that to say that God has unrealized\npotentialities and contingent properties is not to say that God\nmust be in relation with some world of entities other than\nGod. Alston admits that Hartshorne legitimately points out some of the\ninternal contradictions contained in the classical theistic version of\ncreation ex nihilo, but he claims that there is no connection\ndrawn by Hartshorne between divine creation and metaphysical\nprinciples regarding relativity, contingency, and potentiality.\nAlston\u2019s belief seems to be that those who accept creation\nex nihilo are not saying that there is absolutely nothing at\nany stage: there is God. Rather, creation ex nihilo only\nmeans that there is nothing out of which God creates the universe.\nHere Alston seems to agree with Norman Kretzmann, Eleonore Stump, and\nmost other theists who are analytic philosophers.\n\nAlston\u2019s stance here is problematic for two reasons, from\nHartshorne\u2019s point of view. First, although belief in\nsome sort of divine creativity has deep roots in the history\nof religious experience, it is not clear that these roots have to tap\ninto creation ex nihilo. For example, it is not clear that\ncreation ex nihilo is the sort of creation described in\nGenesis, in that when the Bible starts with the statement that the\nspirit of God hovered above the waters, one gets the impression that\nboth God and the aqueous muck had been around forever. If one believes\nin creation ex nihilo, however, as Alston does, one might\nnonetheless claim that creation ex nihilo does not\nnecessarily mean a temporal beginning to the act of creation. But even\non this hypothesis there are problems, and this would seem to be\nHartshorne\u2019s second point. If Plato and Hartshorne are correct\nthat being is dynamic power, then the sort of unlimited power\nimplied by creation ex nihilo is impossible. Hartshorne would\nargue, contra Alston, that there is a connection between belief in\ncreation ex hyle (as opposed to creation ex nihilo)\nand the metaphysical principle that being is dynamic power. Creation\nex nihilo, Hartshorne thinks, is a convenient fiction\ninvented in the first centuries B.C.E. and C.E. in order to exalt\ndivine power, but it is not the only sort of creation that religious\nbelievers have defended, nor is it defensible if being is dynamic\npower.\n\nConcerning contrast 6, Alston claims that belief in creation ex\nnihilo and belief in divine omnipotence are separate beliefs such\nthat to argue against the former is not necessarily to argue against\nthe latter. Hartshorne tries to do too much, he thinks, with the claim\nthat being is power when he uses this claim to argue against divine\nomnipotence. According to Alston, God can have unlimited\npower, power to do anything that God wills to do, without having\nall power in that, if being is power, the creatures also have\nsome power.\n\nOn Hartshorne\u2019s interpretation of Alston, however, God can have\nideal\u00a0power, but not all power, because in addition to divine\npower there are the existences of others with powers of their own.\nAlthough God does not have all power, Hartshorne thinks that on\nAlston\u2019s view God could have all power. In effect, what\nAlston has done, according to Hartshorne, is reduce his stance\nregarding divine omnipotence to that regarding creation ex\nnihilo in that the claim that God could have all power is due to\nthe prior belief that God brings everything into existence out of\nabsolutely nothing, a belief that Alston thinks has to be the\ntraditional one and in point of fact is intelligible. It is not quite\nclear to Hartshorne, however, that it is unquestionably the\ntraditional one, nor is it clear to him that we can develop an\nintelligible concept of \u201cabsolutely nothing.\u201d\n\nHartshorne\u2019s Platonic or Bergsonian argument against creation\nex nihilo, in simplified form, looks something like this: one\ncan in fact imagine the nonexistence of this or that, or even of this\nor that class of things, a fact that gives some the confidence to\n(erroneously) think that this process can go on infinitely such that\none could imagine a state in which there was \u201cabsolutely\nnothing.\u201d However, not every verbally possible statement is made\nconceptually cogent by even the most generous notion of\n\u201cconceptual,\u201d according to Hartshorne. At the specific,\nordinary, empirical level negative instances are possible (e.g., this\ncorkscrew is not a dog), but at the generic, metaphysical level only\npositive instances are possible (e.g., something must exist), on this\nview. The sheer absence of reality cannot conceivably be experienced,\nhe thinks, for if it were experienced an existing experiencer would be\npresupposed.\n\nContrast 7 deals with divine embodiment. Alston is willing to grant\nthat God is embodied in two senses: (1) God is aware, with maximal\nimmediacy, of what goes on in the world; and (2) God can directly\naffect what happens in the world. That is, Alston defends a limited\nversion of divine embodiment, similar to that defended by Richard\nSwinburne. However, Alston is sceptical regarding a stronger version\nof divine embodiment wherein the world exists by metaphysical\nnecessity such that God must animate it. Alston is willing to\naccept the idea that God has a body, but only if having such\na body is on God\u2019s terms. It seems that this weaker version of\ndivine embodiment defended by Alston, as opposed to Hartshorne\u2019s\nstronger version wherein there is essential corporeality in God,\nstands or falls with the defense of creation ex nihilo. In\nfact, despite Alston\u2019s desire to examine each contrast\nindividually, as opposed to Hartshorne\u2019s stark contrast between\nclassical theistic attributes (all ten of them) and neoclassical\nattributes (all ten of them), he ends up linking his criticisms of\nHartshorne regarding contrasts 5\u20137, at the very least. All three\nof these classical theistic attributes stand together only with a\ndefensible version of creation ex nihilo.\n\nContrasts 8\u20139, concerning nontemporality and immutability, are\nalso linked by Alston. He concedes that if God is temporal, Hartshorne\nhas offered us the best version to date of what divine temporality and\ndivine mutability would be like. Alston dismisses as idle the view\nthat God could remain completely unchanged through a succession of\ntemporal moments, but this admission still leaves us, he thinks, with\nthe following conditional statement: \u201cGod undergoes change\nif God is in time.\u201d Alston\u2019s critique of\nHartshorne\u2019s view also consists in a refusal to grant that\ncontingency and temporality are coextensive in the way mutability and\ntemporality are. Alston believes, contra Hartshorne, that God can be\nin some way contingent (that any relation in which God stands to the\nworld might have been otherwise) and still be nontemporal.\n\nAlston knows that the notion of a nontemporal God who is nonetheless\nqualified by relation to temporal beings will strike Hartshorne as\nunintelligible. Alston\u2019s attempt to make his position\nintelligible rests on his own Thomistic-Whiteheadian stance, or\nbetter, on his Thomistic or Boethian interpretation of Whitehead\n(strange as this seems); Alston is also influenced here by Eleanore\nStump and Norman Kretzmann. We should not think of God as involved in\nprocess or becoming of any sort. The best temporal analogy, he thinks,\nfor this conception is an unextended instant or an \u201ceternal\nnow.\u201d For Alston this does not commit one, however, as\nHartshorne would allege, to a static deity frozen in immobility. On\nthe contrary, according to Alston, God is eternally active in ways\nthat do not require temporal succession. God\u2019s acts can be\ncomplete in an instant. Alston includes God\u2019s acts of knowledge,\na stance that at least seems to conflict with one of the concessions\nhe made to Hartshorne regarding the first group of attributes.\n\nThe Boethian-Thomistic notion of the specious present for God, on the\nanalogue of a human being\u2019s perceiving some temporally extended\nstretch of a process in one temporally indivisible act, is also\ndefended by Alston. For example, one can perceive the flight of a bee\n\u201call at once\u201d without first perceiving the first half of\nthe stretch of flight and then perceiving the second. One\u2019s\nperception can be without temporal succession even if the object of\none\u2019s perception is, in fact, temporally successive. All we have\nto do, on Alston\u2019s view, is expand our specious present to cover\nall of time and we have a model for God\u2019s awareness of the\nworld. This is a much more difficult project for Hartshorne to imagine\nthan it is for Alston. Apparently Alston thinks that it is easy to\nconceptualize God \u201cseeing\u201d Neanderthal man (or Adam),\nMoses, Jesus, and Dorothy Day all at once in their immediacy. Here\nAlston has a view similar to that of William Mann.\n\nBut even if it were possible to have nonsuccessive awareness\nof a vast succession, which Hartshorne would deny, it is even more\nimplausible, from Hartshorne\u2019s point of view, to claim, as does\nAlston, that God could have nonsuccessive responses to stages\nof that succession. It might make more sense for Alston to say\n\u201cindesponses\u201d or \u201cpresponses\u201d rather than\n\u201cresponses,\u201d as Creel would urge.\n\nIt is correct of Alston to notice that there is no loss in God, but\nthis is not incompatible with God\u2019s temporality, according to\nHartshorne. There can be succession in God without there being loss or\nperishing due to the fact that God\u2019s inheritance of what happens\nin the world and God\u2019s memory are ideal. Hartshorne thinks that\nthe future is incomplete and indeterminate for God as well as from our\nlimited perspective. Alston, by way of contrast, wants to defend a God\nwho is not strictly necessary in actuality, but is contingent,\ndespite the fact that God does not undergo temporal change,\nnor is God fluent. Hartshorne\u2019s defenders, by way of contrast,\nthink that one of the greatest virtues of process thinking is its\neffort to eliminate what they see as such self-contradiction in\nphilosophical theology.\n\nAlston\u2019s treatment of contrast 10, concerning absolute versus\nrelative perfection, follows from what he has said regarding contrasts\n8\u20139. Relative perfection in God, as opposed to absolute\nperfection, has a point only for a temporal being; hence God is\nabsolutely perfect, according to Alston. A being that does not\nsuccessively assume different states could not possibly surpass\nitself. Here, once again, Alston engages in linkage, thereby, at the\nvery least, confirming Hartshorne\u2019s belief that we need both to\nconsider the divine attributes together and to determine whether the\nclassical theist\u2019s linkage or the neoclassical theist\u2019s\nlinkage is more defensible. For the most past, Alston opts for\nclassical theism. Or more precisely, he thinks that the strongest\nconcept of God is acquired when we take a modified version of the\nneoclassical attributes in contrasts 1\u20134 and combine them with\nthe classical attributes in contrasts 5\u201310.\n\nThis rapproachement in Alston between classical theism and\nneoclassical theism is a step beyond James Ross\u2019s belief that\nthese are two competing descriptions of God at an impasse. Hartshorne\nseems to agree with Ross. Neoclassical, dipolar theism\nalready includes the best insights of classical theism, he\nthinks.\n\nFrom Hartshorne\u2019s point of view the linkage of attributes\nwithin the first group and within the second group\nneeds to be corrected by a greater concern for reticulating the\nattributes in these two groups. He thinks that an explanation is\nneeded regarding how Alston can be committed to both monopolar and\ndipolar theism. For example, Alston ends up defending the view that\nGod is changed by the objects God knows (pace the neoclassical,\ndipolar attributes), but these are not changes that occur in time\n(pace the classical, monopolar attributes). It is one thing,\nHartshorne thinks, to say that God exists in a nontemporal specious\npresent, and it is another to say that God is changed by temporal\nbeings in a nontemporal specious present. The former view is at least\nproblematic, he thinks, and the latter seems to be part of the\ntraditional classical theistic view wherein, from a Hartshornian\nperspective, inconsistency goes in the guise of mystery.\n",
