Causality in al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\n\nAl-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\u2019s cosmology of God\u2019s determination\nand His control over events in His creation through chains of causes\n(singl. sabab) aimed at safeguarding the Sunni doctrine of\nomnipotence and divine pre-determination against the criticism of\nMu\u2019tazilites and Shiites. Humans have only the impression of a\nfree will (ikhtiy\u00e2r). In reality they are compelled to\nchoose what they deem is the best action (khayr) among the\npresent alternatives. Avicenna\u2019s determinist ontology, where\nevery event in the created world is by itself contingent (mumkim\nal-wuj\u00fbd bi-dh\u00e2tihi) yet also necessitated by\nsomething else (w\u00e2jib al-wuj\u00fbd bi-ghayrihi),\nprovided a suitable interpretation of God\u2019s pre-determination\nand is readily adopted by al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee although he never\nadmits that or uses Avicenna\u2019s language. In Avicenna the First\nBeing, which is God, makes all other beings and events necessary. In\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee God\u2019s will, which is distinct from His\nessence, necessitates all beings and events in creation. The\nadaptation of fundamental assumptions in Avicenna\u2019s cosmology\ntogether with an almost wholesale acceptance of Avicenna\u2019s\npsychology and his prophetology led Frank (1992, 86) to conclude\n\u201cthat from a theological standpoint most of [Avicenna\u2019s]\ntheses which he rejected are relatively tame and inconsequential\ncompared to those in which he follows the philosopher.\u201d\n\nWhile al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\u2019s determinist cosmology is a\nradical but faithful interpretation of the Ash\u2019arite tenet of\ndivine pre-determination, the way al-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee writes about\nit in his Revival and later works violates other principles\nof Ash\u2019arism and has led to much confusion among modern\ninterpreters. The remainder of this article will make an attempt to\nresolve current interpretative problems and explain\nal-Ghaz\u00e2l\u00ee\u2019s innovative approach towards\ncausality.\n",
