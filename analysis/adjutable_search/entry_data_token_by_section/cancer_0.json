    "main_text": "Defining and Classifying Cancer\n1. Defining and Classifying Cancer\n\nWhat is cancer? Is cancer one disease, or many? If many, how many\ncancers are there? One might think that such questions are merely\nempirical. However, it turns out that defining and classifying cancer\nis contested not merely for empirical reasons. There are at least two\nbroader philosophical issues at stake. First, there is little\nagreement on how to characterize disease, distinguish disease from\nhealth, and thus classify diseases, generally (See the entry on\n concepts of health and disease).\n Second, cancers exhibit features that make generating classifications\ndifficult; they are heterogeneous, and variable in their etiology and\ncourse of progression. In section 1.1, we will consider challenges\nfacing cancer classification given its intrinsic heterogeneity, and in\nsection 1.2, we will consider challenges facing cancer classification\ngiven its variable natural history. \n\nPrima facie, what distinguishes diseases are typical\nsymptoms, disease course, and a common cause. However, cancer can be\npresent without clinically detectable symptoms, has variable disease\ncourse, and is a multifactorial disease. It is difficult to pick out a\n\u201ccausal bottleneck\u201d uniquely necessary for cancer in\ngeneral, let alone each cancer type and subtype. While cancers are\ntypically classified by their cell-of-origin\u2014or the tissue, or\norgan, and cell-type where they originated (e.g., squamous cell\ncarcinoma of the skin or ovaries), it turns out that cancers can\ncontain mixes of different cells of origin, and cancers arising in the\nsame cells or tissues can have very different features, may evolve in\ndifferent ways, and have different vulnerability to treatment\n(Marusyk, et al. 2012). How, then, are we to classify such poorly\nbehaving kinds? These puzzles led researchers to wonder whether there\nare distinctive genetic or molecular \u201csignatures\u201d of each\ncancer that can help us estimate risk of progression, or chances of\nrecurrence, as well as predict responses to treatment. Perhaps these\nmolecular signatures are the key to a natural taxonomy of cancer types\nand subtypes?\n",
