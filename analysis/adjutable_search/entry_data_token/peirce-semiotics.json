Although sign theories have a\nlong history, Peirce\u2019s accounts are distinctive and innovative for\ntheir breadth and complexity, and for capturing the importance of\ninterpretation to signification. For Peirce, developing a\nthoroughgoing theory of signs was a central philosophical and\nintellectual preoccupation. The importance of semiotic for Peirce is\nwide ranging. As he himself said, \u201c[\u2026] it has never been\nin my power to study anything, \u2013 mathematics, ethics, metaphysics,\ngravitation, thermodynamics, optics, chemistry, comparative anatomy,\nastronomy, psychology, phonetics, economics, the history of science,\nwhist, men and women, wine, metrology, except as a study of\nsemiotic\u201d (SS 1977, 85\u20136). Peirce also treated sign theory\nas central to his work on logic, as the medium for inquiry and the\nprocess of scientific discovery, and even as one possible means for\n\u2018proving\u2019 his pragmatism. Its importance in Peirce\u2019s philosophy, then,\ncannot be overestimated.\n\nAcross the course of his intellectual life, Peirce continually\nreturned to and developed his ideas about signs and semiotic and there\nare three broadly delineable accounts: a concise Early Account from\nthe 1860s; a complete and relatively neat Interim Account developed\nthrough the 1880s and 1890s and presented in 1903; and his\nspeculative, rambling, and incomplete Final Account developed between\n1906 and 1910. The following entry examines these three accounts, and\ntraces the changes that led Peirce to develop earlier accounts and\ngenerate new, more complex, sign theories. However, despite these\nchanges, Peirce\u2019s ideas on the basic structure of signs and\nsignification remain largely uniform throughout his developments.\nConsequently, it is useful to begin with an account of the basic\nstructure of signs according to Peirce.\n", "toc": [{"#BasSigStr": "1.

Basic Sign Structure\n\nIn one of his many definitions of a sign, Peirce writes:\n\nI define a sign as anything which is so determined by something else,\ncalled its Object, and so determines an effect upon a person, which\neffect I call its interpretant, that the later is thereby mediately\ndetermined by the former. (EP2, 478)\n\n\nWhat we see here is Peirce\u2019s basic claim that signs consist of three\ninter-related parts: a sign, an object, and an interpretant. For the\nsake of simplicity, we can think of the sign as the signifier, for\nexample, a written word, an utterance, smoke as a sign for fire etc.\nThe object, on the other hand, is best thought of as whatever is\nsignified, for example, the object to which the written or uttered\nword attaches, or the fire signified by the smoke. The interpretant,\nthe most innovative and distinctive feature of Peirce\u2019s account, is\nbest thought of as the understanding that we have of the sign/object\nrelation. The importance of the interpretant for Peirce is that\nsignification is not a simple dyadic relationship between sign and\nobject: a sign signifies only in being interpreted. This makes the\ninterpretant central to the content of the sign, in that, the meaning\nof a sign is manifest in the interpretation that it generates in sign\nusers. Things are, however, slightly more complex than this and we\nshall look at these three elements in more detail.\n1.1 The Signifying Element of Signs\n\nThe very first thing to note is that there are some potential\nterminological difficulties here. We appear to be saying that there\nare three elements of a sign, one of which is the sign. This is\nconfusing and does not fully capture Peirce\u2019s idea. Strictly speaking,\nfor Peirce, we are interested in the signifying element, and\nit is not the sign as a whole that signifies. In speaking of the sign\nas the signifying element, then, he is more properly speaking of the\nsign refined to those elements most crucial to its functioning as a\nsignifier. Peirce uses numerous terms for the signifying element\nincluding \u201csign\u201d, \u201crepresentamen\u201d,\n\u201crepresentation\u201d, and \u201cground\u201d. Here we shall\nrefer to that element of the sign responsible for signification as the\n\u201csign-vehicle\u201d.\n\nPeirce\u2019s idea that a sign does not signify in all respects and has\nsome particular signifying element is perhaps best made clear with an\nexample. Consider, for instance, a molehill in my lawn taken as a sign\nof moles. Not every characteristic of the molehill plays a part in\nsignifying the presence of moles. The color of the molehill plays a\nsecondary role since it will vary according to the soil from which it\nis composed. Similarly, the sizes of molehills vary according to the\nsize of the mole that makes them, so again, this feature is not\nprimary in the molehill\u2019s ability to signify. What is central here is\nthe causal connection that exists between the type of mound in my lawn\nand moles: since moles make molehills, molehills signify moles.\nConsequently, primary to the molehill\u2019s ability to signify the mole is\nthe brute physical connection between it and a mole. This is the\nsign-vehicle of the sign. For Peirce, then, it is only some element of\na sign that enables it to signify its object, and when speaking of the\nsignifying element of the sign, or rather, the sign-vehicle, it is\nthis qualified sign that he means.\n1.2 The Object\n\nJust as with the sign, not every characteristic of the object is\nrelevant to signification: only certain features of an object enable a\nsign to signify it. For Peirce, the relationship between the object of\na sign and the sign that represents it is one of determination: the\nobject determines the sign. Peirce\u2019s notion of determination is by no\nmeans clear and it is open to interpretation, but for our purposes, it\nis perhaps best understood as the placing of constraints or\nconditions on successful signification by the object, rather than the\nobject causing or generating the sign. The idea is\nthat the object imposes certain parameters that a sign must fall\nwithin if it is to represent that object. However, only certain\ncharacteristics of an object are relevant to this process of\ndetermination. To see this in terms of an example, consider again the\ncase of the molehill.\n\nThe sign is the molehill, and the object of this sign is the mole. The\nmole determines the sign, in as much as, if the molehill is to succeed\nas a sign for the mole it must show the physical presence of the mole.\nIf it fails to do this, it fails to be a sign of that object. Other\nsigns for this object, apart from the molehill, might include the\npresence of mole droppings, or a particular pattern of ground\nsubsidence on my lawns, but all such signs are constrained by the need\nto show the physical presence of the mole. Clearly, not everything\nabout the mole is relevant to this constraining process: the mole\nmight be a conventional black color or an albino, it might be male or\nfemale, it might be young or old. None of these features, however, are\nessential to the constraints placed upon the sign. Rather, the causal\nconnection between it and the mole is the characteristic that it\nimposes upon its sign, and it is this connection that the sign must\nrepresent if it is to succeed in signifying the mole.\n1.3 The Interpretant \n\nAlthough there are many features of the interpretant that bear further\ncomment, here we shall mention just two. First, although we have\ncharacterized the interpretant as the understanding we reach of some\nsign/object relation, it is perhaps more properly thought of as the\ntranslation or development of the original sign. The idea is that the\ninterpretant provides a translation of the sign, allowing us a more\ncomplex understanding of the sign\u2019s object. Indeed, Liszka (1996) and\nSavan (1988) both emphasize the need to treat interpretants as\ntranslations, with Savan even suggesting Peirce should have called it\nthe translatant (Savan 1988, 41). Second, just as with the sign/object\nrelation, Peirce believes the sign/interpretant relation to be one of\ndetermination: the sign determines an interpretant. Further, this\ndetermination is not determination in any causal sense, rather, the\nsign determines an interpretant by using certain features of the way\nthe sign signifies its object to generate and shape our understanding.\nSo, the way that smoke generates or determines an interpretant sign of\nits object, fire, is by focusing our attention upon the physical\nconnection between smoke and fire.\n\nFor Peirce, then, any instance of signification contains a\nsign-vehicle, an object and interpretant. Moreover, the object\ndetermines the sign by placing constraints which any sign must meet if\nit is to signify the object. Consequently, the sign signifies its\nobject only in virtue of some of its features. Additionally, the sign\ndetermines an interpretant by focusing our understanding on certain\nfeatures of the signifying relation between sign and object. This\nenables us to understand the object of the sign more fully.\n\nAlthough this is a general picture of Peirce\u2019s ideas about sign\nstructure, and certain features are more or less present, or given\ngreater or lesser emphasis at various points in Peirce\u2019s development\nof his theory of signs, this triadic structure and the relation\nbetween the elements is present in all of Peirce\u2019s accounts. In what\nfollows, we shall see three of Peirce\u2019s attempts at giving a full\naccount of signs and signification, the corresponding sign typologies,\nlook at the transitions between these accounts, and examine some of\nthe issues that arise from them.\n2. Peirce\u2019s Early Account: 1867\u20138.\n\nPeirce\u2019s earliest significant attempt at an account of signs comes in\nhis 1867 paper \u201cOn A New List of Categories\u201d (W2\n.49\u201358). In that account, we find the same basic sign structure\noutlined above: any sign, or representation as Peirce calls it at this\nearly stage, will have a sign-vehicle, an object, and an interpretant.\nAn important difference here though is how he thinks of the relation\nbetween signs and interpretants. In particular, Peirce thought that\nwhilst our interpreting the signifying relation between sign and\nobject relied upon understanding the basis of signification in any\ngiven case, he also thought that the generated interpretant itself\nfunctioned as a further, more developed sign of the object in\nquestion. And of course, as a further sign, it will also signify that\nobject through some features, which again, we must interpret, and\ngenerate a further interpretant. As will be obvious, this leads to an\ninfinite chain of signs. If any sign must generate an interpretant in\norder to be a sign, and any sign is itself the interpretant of some\nfurther sign, then clearly, there must be an infinity of signs both\nproceeding and preceding from any given instance of signification.\nSome scholars (for example, Short 2004; 2007) think that\ninfinite semiosis is a characteristic only of Peirce\u2019s early account.\nOthers, (Liszka 1996, Savan 1988) treat infinite semiosis as present\nin all of Peirce\u2019s accounts. We shall return to the issue of infinite\nsemiosis in the early account below. First, we shall look at the types\nof sign to which Peirce\u2019s early account gives rise.\n\nPeirce thought that \u201crepresentations\u201d generate further\ninterpretants in one of three possible ways. First, via \u201ca mere\ncommunity in some quality\u201d (W2 .56). These he calls likenesses,\nbut they are more familiarly known as icons. Second, those\n\u201cwhose relation to their objects consists in a correspondence in\nfact\u201d (W2 .56) are termed indices. And finally, those\n\u201cwhose relation to their objects is an imputed character\u201d\n(W2. 56) are called symbols. Put simply, if we come to\ninterpret a sign as standing for its object in virtue of some shared\nquality, then the sign is an icon. Peirce\u2019s early examples of icons\nare portraits and noted similarities between the letters p and b (W2.\n53\u20134). If on the other hand, our interpretation comes in virtue\nof some brute, existential fact, causal connections say, then the sign\nis an index. Early examples include the weathercock, and the\nrelationship between the murderer and his victim (W2. 53\u20134). And\nfinally, if we generate an interpretant in virtue of some observed\ngeneral or conventional connection between sign and object, then the\nsign is a symbol. Early examples include the words \u201chomme\u201d\nand \u201cman\u201d sharing a reference. (W2. 53\u20134).\n\nThis, then, is the very first outing for Peirce\u2019s famous division of\nsigns into Icons, Indexes, and Symbols. Although Peirce\u2019s precise\nthoughts about the nature of this division were to change at various\npoints in his development of sign theory, the division nonetheless\nremains throughout his work. There are, however, some important\nfeatures to this early account that mark it out from the later\ndevelopments. We shall look at two of these features here: the\nimportance of thought-signs; and infinite semiosis.\n2.1 Thought-Signs\n\nAn interesting feature of Peirce\u2019s early account is that he is keen to\nassociate signs with cognition. In particular, Peirce claims that all\nthought is in signs (W2. 213). We can see this from Peirce\u2019s early\nidea that every interpretant is itself a further sign of the signified\nobject. Since interpretants are the interpreting thoughts we have of\nsignifying relations, and these interpreting thoughts are themselves\nsigns, it seems to be a straight-forward consequence that all thoughts\nare signs, or as Peirce calls them \u201cthought-signs\u201d. One\ninteresting consequence of this is that in the early account, Peirce\nis quick to dismiss the importance and relevance of icons and\nindices.\n\nThe objects of the understanding, considered as representations, are\nsymbols, that is, signs which are at least potentially general. But\nthe rules of logic hold good of any symbols, of those which are\nwritten or spoken as well as those which are thought. They have no\nimmediate application to likeness [icons] or indices, because no\narguments can be constructed of these alone, but do apply to all\nsymbols. (W2. 56)\n\n\nThis gives Peirce\u2019s early account of signs a rather narrow scope; it\nis concerned primarily with the general and conventional signs of\nwhich our language and cognition consist. The reason for this narrow\nfocus is simple: for Peirce, since symbols are \u201cpotentially\ngeneral\u201d and fall under the remit of general rules, they are a\nfit subject of study for his primary focus, logic. This early account,\nthen, focuses mainly on general and conventional signs, those signs\nidentified by Peirce as symbols. Icons and indices, although noted at\nthis early stage, are considered of secondary philosophical\nimportance. As we shall see later, this narrow focus is something that\nPeirce was later to revise.\n2.2 Infinite Semiosis\n\nAs previously noted, part and parcel of Peirce\u2019s early account of\nsigns is that an infinity of further signs both proceed and precede\nfrom any given sign. This is a consequence of the way Peirce thinks of\nthe elements of signs at this early stage and seems to stem from his\nidea that interpretants are to count as further signs, and signs are\ninterpretants of earlier signs. Since any sign must determine an\ninterpretant in order to count as a sign, and interpretants are\nthemselves signs, infinite chains of signs seem to become conceptually\nnecessary.\n\nTo see this, imagine a chain of signs with either a first or a last\nsign. The final sign that terminates the semiotic process will have no\ninterpretant; if it did, that interpretant would function as a further\nsign and generate a further interpretant, and the final sign would, in\nfact, not terminate the process. However, since any sign must\ndetermine an interpretant to count as a sign, the final sign would not\nbe a sign unless it had an interpretant. Similarly, a first sign could\nnot be the interpretant of a preceding sign. If it were, that previous\nsign would be the first sign. However, since any sign must be an\ninterpretant of a previous sign, a first sign would not be a sign\nunless it was also an interpretant of a previous sign. The problem is\nthat if we allow a final sign with no interpretant, or a first sign\nwhich is not the interpretant or some earlier sign, then we have\nfailed signs in the semiotic process. This affects the rest of the\nsemiotic chain causing something like a collapse of dominoes. For\nexample, if the final sign fails to be a sign in virtue of generating\nno interpretant, then since that failed sign is supposed to act as the\ninterpretant of the previous sign and function as a further sign in\nits own right, it has also failed to be an interpretant. The\nconsequence of this is that the previous sign has failed to generate a\nproper interpretant and so failed to be a sign. The consequence of\nthis is that\u2026and so on. The alternative is not to countenance\nterminating signs. And obviously, if we cannot end the semiotic\nprocess then signs continue generating signs ad infinitum.\n\nPeirce was both aware and untroubled by infinite semiosis. In part,\nthis is due to the anti-Cartesian project carried out in Peirce\u2019s work\nin the 1860s. A significant part of this project for Peirce is the\ndenial of intuitions, something that Peirce took as a key assumption\nof Cartesian philosophical method. Given that Peirce defines\n\u201cintuition\u201d as \u201ca cognition not determined by a\nprevious cognition of the same object\u201d (W2. 193), it seems clear\nthat the infinite procession of thought-signs generated by earlier\nthought-signs and in turn generating further thought-signs is part and\nparcel of the denial of intuitions. However, in later developments to\nhis sign theory, despite never explicitly relinquishing infinite\nsemiosis, many of the concepts that lead to it are replaced or\nrevised, and the concept becomes less prominent in Peirce\u2019s\nwork. (See Atkin 2015, 132\u2013135) for more on the anti-Cartesian\nmotivation of Peirce\u2019s early account of signs).\n3. The Interim Account: 1903\n\nIn 1903, Peirce gave a series of lectures at Harvard, and at The\nLowell Institute. Part of these lectures was an account of signs.\nHowever, the 1903 account of signs showed considerable developments to\nthe early account of the 1860s. First, where the early account\nsuggested three classes of sign, the 1903 account suggests ten classes\nof sign. Second, where the account the 1860s treats the general sign,\nor symbol, as the main focus of sign theory, the 1903 account counts\nmany more sign types as within the focus of philosophy and logic.\nThird, Peirce dropped the claim that an infinite chain of signs\nprecedes any given sign (see Short 2004, 221\u20132).\n\nThese changes seem to be partly a consequence of developments in\nsymbolic logic made by Peirce and his Johns Hopkins student, Oscar\nMitchell, in the early 1880s. As is well known, during this time, and\nindependently of Frege, Peirce and Mitchell developed quantification\ntheory (see Peirce 1883, and W5. 162\u2013191). An essential part\nof this development was the inclusion of singular propositions and\nindividual variables for objects that cannot be picked out be definite\ndescriptions. Peirce treated these non-general signs as indices, which\nin turn led him to identify the index as an essential part of logic.\nThis made his earlier account of signs seem underdeveloped. (See, for\ninstance, Short 2004, 219\u2013222; Hookway 2000, 127\u2013131;\nand Murphey 1961, 299\u2013300). This appears to have led Peirce to\ntake signs other than the symbol more seriously. In particular, it led\nPeirce to realize that some symbolic signs had distinctly indexical\n(that is non-general) features. Similarly, symbols with heavily iconic\nfeatures, especially in mathematics (see Hookway 1985 Ch 6), were more\nimportant than he thought. What this meant, of course, was that the\naccount of the 1860s was now woefully inadequate to the task of\ncapturing the range of signs and signification that Peirce thought\nimportant for philosophy and logic.\n\nA further point worth noting about Peirce\u2019s developing\nsign theory is that by 1903, he had begun to think of his overall\nphilosophy in architectonic terms, and this included a broadening of\nhis view of semiotics (see Atkin 2015, 15\u201320). Put simply, Peirce\nthought that all domains of thought were connected and structured\nhierarchically, and that logic, \u201cin its general sense, is\n\u2026 only another name for semiotic\u201d (CP2.227 1897).\nLogic, construed as extensive with semiotic, in Peirce\u2019s\nhierarchy contained three domains \u2013 Speculative\nGrammar (which is the study of sign classifications);\nCritical Logic (which is the study of the form and evaluation\nof arguments); and Methodeutic (which is the student of\nscientific inquiry). The discussion of Peirce\u2019s sign theory here\nis placed firmly in the domain of speculative grammar, however, in the\nlater developments of his work, Peirce began to think of these\nthree areas of \u201clogic\u201d as involving semiotics. (See\nBellucci 2017 for a discussion of speculative grammar and its\ndevelopment in Peirce\u2019s thought).\n\nPeirce\u2019s 1903 account of signs, then, is notable for its broader\nscope, relative neatness, and completeness. In it Peirce returns to\nthe basic sign structure we gave above and by paying close attention\nto those elements of signs and the various interactions between them\ngives what seems to be an extensive account of signification, and an\nexhaustive typology of signs far beyond the range of his early account\nof the 1860s. To understand Peirce\u2019s 1903 account, we must return to\nthe three elements of signification, namely, the sign-vehicle, the\nobject, and the interpretant and see how Peirce thinks their function\nin signification leads to an exhaustive classification of sign\ntypes.\n3.1 Sign-Vehicles\n\nRecall that Peirce thought signs signify their objects not through all\ntheir features, but in virtue of some particular feature. By 1903, for\nreasons related to his work on phenomenology, Peirce thought the\ncentral features of sign-vehicles could be divided into three broad\nareas, and consequently, that signs could be classified accordingly.\nThis division depends upon whether sign-vehicles signify in virtue of\nqualities, existential facts, or conventions and laws. Further, signs\nwith these sign-vehicles are classified as qualisigns,\nsinsigns, and legisigns respectively.\n\nExamples of signs whose sign-vehicle relies upon a quality are\ndifficult to imagine, but a particularly clear example, used by David\nSavan, is this:\n\n[\u2026] I use a color chip to identify the color of some paint I\nwant to buy. The color chip is perhaps made of cardboard, rectangular,\nresting on a wooden table etc., etc. But it is only the color of the\nchip that is essential to it as a sign of the color of the paint.\n(Savan 1988, 20)\n\n\nThere are many elements to the colored chip as a sign, but it is only\nits color that matters to its ability to signify. Any sign whose\nsign-vehicle relies, as with this example, on simple abstracted\nqualities is called a qualisign.\n\nAn example of a sign whose sign-vehicle uses existential facts is\nsmoke as a sign for fire; the causal relation between the fire and\nsmoke allows the smoke to act as a signifier. Other cases are the\nmolehill example used earlier, and temperature as a sign for a fever.\nAny sign whose sign-vehicle relies upon existential connections with\nits object is named, by Peirce, a sinsign.\n\nAnd finally, the third kind of sign is one whose crucial signifying\nelement is primarily due to convention, habit or law. Typical examples\nwould be traffic lights as sign of priority, and the signifying\ncapability of words; these sign-vehicles signify in virtue of the\nconventions surrounding their use. Peirce calls signs whose\nsign-vehicles function in this way legisigns.\n3.2 Objects\n\nJust as Peirce thought signs could be classified according to whether\ntheir sign-vehicles function in virtue of qualities, existential\nfacts, or conventions and laws, he thought signs were similarly\nclassifiable according to how their object functioned in\nsignification. Recall that, for Peirce, objects\n\u201cdetermine\u201d their signs. That is to say, the nature of the\nobject constrains the nature of the sign in terms of what successful\nsignification requires. Again, Peirce thought the nature of these\nconstraints fell into three broad classes: qualitative, existential or\nphysical, and conventional and law-like. Further, if the constraints\nof successful signification require that the sign reflect qualitative\nfeatures of the object, then the sign is an icon. If the\nconstraints of successful signification require that the sign utilize\nsome existential or physical connection between it and its object,\nthen the sign is an index. And finally, if successful\nsignification of the object requires that the sign utilize some\nconvention, habit, or social rule or law that connects it with its\nobject, then the sign is a symbol.\n\nThis is a trichotomy with which we are already familiar from the early\naccount, and indeed, the examples of icons, indices, and symbols are\nlargely the same as before: icons are portraits and paintings, indices\nare natural and causal signs, symbols are words and so on. There are,\nhowever, additional instances, for example, icons include diagrams\nused in geometrical reasoning, indices include pointing fingers and\nproper names, and symbols including broad speech acts like assertion\nand judgment, all of which suggests a considerable broadening of this\ntrichotomy. It is well worth noting, though, that by 1903 Peirce was\naware that it would be hard, if not impossible, to find any pure\ninstances of icons and indices. Rather, he began to suspect that icons\nand indices were always partly symbolic or conventional. To try to\ncapture this, Peirce experimented with some additional terminology and\ntypes of icon and index. These he called the hypo-icon (see CP2 .276\n1903) and the sub-index (see CP 2.330 1903) respectively. We shall not\nexplore these signs further here (see (Goudge 1965) and (Atkin 2005)\nfor more on Peirce\u2019s view of indices, and (Legg 2008) for more on\nicons), but it is worth noting that by 1903, the simple\nicon/index/symbol trichotomy was something of an abstraction, and\nPeirce was aware that any single sign may display some combination of\niconic, indexical and symbolic characteristics.\n3.3 Interpretants\n\nAs with the sign-vehicle and the object, Peirce thought we could\nclassify signs in terms of their relation with their interpretant.\nAgain, he identifies three categories according to which feature of\nthe relationship with its object a sign uses in generating an\ninterpretant. Further, as with the classification of the sign in terms\nof the sign-vehicle and the object, Peirce identifies qualities,\nexistential facts, or conventional features as the basis for\nclassifying the sign in terms of its interpretant.\n\nIf the sign determines an interpretant by focusing our understanding\nof the sign upon the qualitative features it employs in signifying its\nobject, then the sign is classified as a rheme. Examples are\nnot straightforward, but one way of understanding rhemes, is to think\nof them as unsaturated predicates like, \u201c\u2014 is a\ndog\u201d, \u201c\u2014 is happy\u201d, \u201c\u2014 loves\n\u2014\u201d or \u201c\u2014 gives \u2014 to \u2014\u201d, and so\non. Whenever we understand a sign in terms of qualities it suggests\nits object may have, we generate an interpretant that qualifies its\nsign as a rheme. If, on the other hand, a sign determines an\ninterpretant by focusing our understanding of the sign upon the\nexistential features it employs in signifying an object, then the sign\nis a dicent. We can think of dicents is as saturated\npredicates, or propositions, like \u201cFido is a dog\u201d,\n\u201cLarry is happy\u201d, \u201cFido loves Larry\u201d,\n\u201cLarry gives food to Fido\u201d, and so on. And finally, if a\nsign determines an interpretant by focusing our understanding on some\nconventional or law-like features employed in signifying the object,\nthen the sign is a delome, or as Peirce most frequently, but\nconfusingly, calls them, arguments. Further, just as we can\nthink of a rheme as an unsaturated predicate, and a dicent as a\nproposition, we can think of the delome as an argument or rule of\ninference. Our ability to understand a sign in terms of its place in\nsome pattern of reasoning and system of signs enables us to derive\ninformation from it (by deductive reasoning) or make conjectures about\nit (by inductive and abductive reasoning). So, whenever we come to\nunderstand a sign as focusing our attention upon some conventional\nfeature of its relationship with object, that is, enabling us to\nunderstand the sign as part of a rule governed system of knowledge and\nsigns etc., we have an interpretant that qualifies a sign as a delome\n(or argument).\n3.4 The Ten Classes of Signs\n\nPeirce believed that the three elements, and the respective\nclassifications they imposed upon signs, could be combined to give a\ncomplete list of sign types. That is, since a sign has a sign-vehicle\nit can be classified as either a qualisign, a sinsign, or legisign.\nAdditionally, since that sign has an object it can be classified as\neither an icon, an index, or a symbol. And finally, since that sign\nwill also determine an interpretant it can be classified as either a\nrheme, a dicent, or a delome. Each sign is then classifiable as some\ncombination of each of its three elements, that is, as either one of\nthe three types of sign-vehicle, plus one of the three types of\nobject, plus one of the three types of interpretant. Initially, this\nseems to yield twenty-seven possible classificatory combinations, but,\nbecause of certain of Peirce\u2019s phenomenological theories, there are\nrestrictions on how we can combine the different elements that mean\nthere are, in fact, only ten types of sign. (For more on the relation\nbetween Peirce\u2019s phenomenological categories, and his sign typology,\nsee Lizska 1996, Farias and Queiroz 2014, and Savan 1988.)\n\nThe rules for the permissible combinations are actually quite simple\nso long as we bear two things in mind. First, types of each element\nare classifiable as either a quality, an existential fact, or a\nconvention. That is, across the three elements of a sign, there are\nthree types deriving from qualities (the qualisign, the icon, and the\nrheme), three deriving from existential facts, (the sinsign, the\nindex, and the dicent), and three deriving from conventions (the\nlegisign, the symbol, and the delome). Second, the classification of\nthe interpretant depends upon the classification of the object, which\nin turn depends upon the classification of the sign-vehicle. The rules\nthat determine permissible classifications, then, are that if an\nelement is classified as a quality, then its dependent element may\nonly be a classified as a quality. If an element is classified as an\nexistential fact, then its dependent element may be classified as\neither an existential fact, or a quality. And if an element is\nclassified as a convention, then its dependent element may be\nclassified as either a convention, an existential fact, or a quality.\nThis leaves us with ten permissible combinations between a\nsign-vehicle, object and interpretant, and so ten possible kinds of\nsigns. They look something like this:\n\n\n\nInterpretant\nObject\nSign-Vehicle\nExamples (from CP2.254\u2013263 1903) \n\n\n\nRheme\nIcon\nQualisign\n\u201cA feeling of red\u201d \n\nRheme\nIcon\nSinsign;\n\u201cAn Individual Diagram\u201d \n\nRheme\nIndex\nSinsign\n\u201cA spontaneous cry\u201d \n\nDicent\nIndex\nSinsign\n\u201cA Weather Cock\u201d \n\nRheme\nIcon\nLegisign\n\u201cA diagram [type]\u201d \n\nRheme\nIndex\nLegisign\n\u201cA demonstrative pronoun\u201d \n\nDicent\nIndex\nLegisign\n\u201cA street cry\u201d \n\nRheme\nSymbol\nLegisign\n\u201cA common noun\u201d \n\nDicent\nSymbol\nLegisign\n\u201cOrdinary proposition\u201d \n\nDelome\nSymbol\nLegisign\n\u201cAn argument\u201d  \n\n\nThese ten types of sign are simply called after the combination of\ntheir elements: an ordinary proposition is a\ndicentic-symbolic-legisign, a spontaneous cry a\nrhematic-indexical-sinsign, and so on.\n\nDespite its apparent completeness and complexity, however, Peirce soon\nbegan rethinking his 1903 account of signs. Over the final years of\nhis life, he introduced further complexities and nuance to his\nsemiotics.\n4. The Final Account: 1906\u201310\n\nDuring the last part of his life the majority of Peirce\u2019s\nphilosophical output concerned semiotic, and he developed his account\nof signs far beyond the 1903 theory. There seem to be two reasons for\nthis. First, Peirce was geographically and intellectually isolated and\nhis main outlet was correspondence with the English woman, Lady\nVictoria Welby. Welby wrote on various philosophical topics and shared\nPeirce\u2019s interests in signs and meaning. This seems to have given\nPeirce a willing and sympathetic audience for his developing ideas on\nsigns. (See Hardwick 1977 and Borges 2013 for more on the\nPeirce/Welby correspondence). The second reason seems to have\nbeen his growing appreciation of the connections between the semiotic\nprocess and the process of inquiry. Peirce always thought of his\nphilosophy in a systematic and architectonic way. However, around\n1902, an application for funding to the Carnegie Institute saw him\nexpress more clearly the connections between different aspects of his\nphilosophy. The application failed, but Peirce had returned to\nthinking about the place of sign theory in his broader philosophy. As\nnoted above, part of Peirce\u2019s understanding of philosophy in an\narchitectonic system was to treat \u201clogic\u201d as containing\nthree branches \u2013 Speculative Grammar, Critical\nLogic, and Methodeutic. The main impact here was that he\ncame to see sign theory (speculative grammar) as more clearly\nconnected to the logic of scientific discovery (methodeutic) and\nconsequently, as being more central to his account of inquiry. We\nshall not review Peirce\u2019s account of inquiry here, but as an end\ndirected process leading from doubt-prone to doubt-proof beliefs,\nPeirce began to see a similar end-directedness running through the\nsemiotic process. This kind of thinking lead Peirce to reassess his\naccount of signs and sign structure: the connection between the\nprocess of inquiry and sign chains led Peirce to notice subtleties and\nnuances that had previously been transparent to him. In particular, it\nled him to see chains of signs as tending towards a definite but\nidealized end rather than progressing ad infinitum. Since at the\nidealized end of inquiry we have a complete understanding of some\nobject, there need be no further interpretant of that object; our\nunderstanding cannot be developed any further. (See Ransdell 1977\nand Short 2004; 2007 for more on the connections between\nPeirce\u2019s later account and the end-directed process of inquiry.\nIndeed, Short (2007) represents the fullest and best developed account\nof \u2018telic\u2019 interpretations of Peirce\u2019s semiotic to date).\n4.1 Dividing The Object\n\nThe first effect of Peirce\u2019s greater appreciation of the parallels\nbetween inquiry and his sign theory is a distinction between the\nobject of the sign as it we understand at some given point in the\nsemiotic process, and the object of the sign as it stands at the end\nof that process. The former he calls the immediate object,\nand the later he calls the dynamic object. A neat way of\ncapturing this distinction is as the different objects arising from\nthe \u201ctwo answers to the question: what object does this sign\nrefer to? One is the answer that could be given when the sign was\nused; and the other is the one we could give when our scientific\nknowledge is complete\u201d. (Hookway 1985, 139).\n4.1.1 The Dynamic Object\n\nThe dynamic object is, in some senses, the object that generates a\nchain of signs. The aim of a sign chain is to arrive at a full\nunderstanding of an object and so assimilate that object into the\nsystem of signs. Using slightly more simplistic terms, Ransdell (1977,\n169) describes the dynamic object as the \u201cobject as it really\nis\u201d, and Hookway (1985, 139) describes it as \u201cthe object\nas it is known to be [at the end of inquiry]\u201d. Indeed, Hookway\u2019s\ndescription shows an acute awareness of the connection between the\ndynamic object and the process of inquiry in Peirce\u2019s later sign\ntheory. An example, from Liszka (1996, 23), captures Peirce\u2019s idea\nquite clearly: taking a petroleum tank half full with fuel, a variety\nof signs for this half-full state are available. Perhaps there is a\nfuel gauge attached to the tank, or perhaps the tank makes a\ndistinctive sound when we strike it and so on. But, despite these\nvarious signs, the object underlying them all is the actual level of\nfuel in the petroleum tank; this is the dynamic object.\n4.1.2 The Immediate Object\n\nRansdell (1977, 169) describes the immediate object as \u201cwhat we,\nat any time, suppose the object to be\u201d, and Hookway (1985, 139)\ndescribes it as \u201cthe object at the time it is first used and\ninterpreted\u201d. The immediate object, then, is not some additional\nobject distinct from the dynamic object but is merely some\ninformationally incomplete facsimile of the dynamic object generated\nat some interim stage in a chain of signs. Returning to the petroleum\ntank example, when we strike the tank, the tone that it emits (which\nfunctions as the sign-vehicle) represents to us that the tank is not\nfull (but it does not tell us the precise level of fuel). The\nimmediate object, then, is a less-than-full-tank.\n\nClearly, the immediate and dynamic objects of a sign are intimately\nlinked and Peirce consistently describes and introduces the two\ntogether. (See CP 4. 536 1896). However, the connection between\nthe two is most clear when we consider the connections between sign\nchains and inquiry. The dynamic object is, as we have suggested, the\ngoal and end point that drives the semiotic process, and the immediate\nobject is our grasp of that object at any point in that process.\nRansdell, for instance, says:\n\n[T]he immediate object is the object as it appears at any point in the\ninquiry or semiotic process. The [dynamic] object, however, is the\nobject as it really is. These must be distinguished, first, because\nthe immediate object may involve some erroneous interpretation and\nthus be to that extent falsely representative of the object as it\nreally is, and, second, because it may fail to include something that\nis true of the real object. In other words, the immediate object is\nsimply what we at any time suppose the real object to be. (Ransdell\n1977, 169)\n\n\nPut this way, it is clear how Peirce\u2019s growing concern to capture the\nparallels between semiosis and the process of inquiry leads him to\nidentify two objects for the sign.\n4.2 Dividing the Interpretant\n\nJust as with the object(s) of the sign, the parallels between semiotic\nand inquiry result in a similar division of interpretants. As a chain\nof signs moves towards a final end there are different interpretants\nplaying different but important roles. Peirce identifies three\ndifferent ways in which we grasp the way a sign stands for an object.\nHe calls these three types of interpretant, the immediate\ninterpretant, the dynamic interpretant and the final\ninterpretant and describes them like this.\n\nThe [Dynamic] Interpretant is whatever interpretation any mind\nactually makes of a sign. [\u2026]The Final Interpretant does not\nconsist in the way in which any mind does act but in the way in which\nevery mind would act. That is, it consists in a truth which might be\nexpressed in a conditional proposition of this type: \u201cIf so and\nso were to happen to any mind this sign would determine that mind to\nsuch and such conduct.\u201d [\u2026] The Immediate Interpretant\nconsists in the Quality of the Impression that a sign is fit to\nproduce, not to any actual reaction. [\u2026] [I]f there be any\nfourth kind of Interpretant on the same footing as those three, there\nmust be a dreadful rupture of my mental retina, for I can\u2019t see it at\nall. (CP8 .315 1909).\n\n\nWe shall examine each of these in turn, but to get a clearer\nunderstanding of the three interpretants it is helpful to look, very\nbriefly, at Peirce\u2019s three grades of clarity, or understanding since\nPeirce took these to inform his division of interpretants.\n\nIn his 1878 paper, \u201cHow To Make Our Ideas Clear\u201d (W3,\n257\u2013275) Peirce introduces three grades of clarity, or levels of\nunderstanding. In this paper, he introduces his famous pragmatic maxim\nas a development of rationalist notions of \u201cclear and distinct\nideas\u201d. Combining his pragmatic maxim with notions of clarity\nfrom Descartes and Leibniz, Peirce identifies three grades of\nunderstanding. The first grade of clarity is to have an unreflective\ngrasp of some concept in everyday experience. The second grade of\nclarity is to have, or be capable of providing, a general definition\nof that concept. The third grade of clarity, though, comes from\nPeirce\u2019s famous statement of the pragmatic maxim:\n\nConsider what effects, which might conceivably have practical\nbearings, we conceive the object of our conception to have. Then, our\nconception of these effects is the whole of our conception of the\nobject. (W3, 266)\n\n\nA full understanding of some concept, then, involves familiarity with\nit in day-to-day encounters, the ability to offer some general\ndefinition of it, and knowing what effects to expect from holding that\nconcept to be true.\n\nAlthough these grades of clarity are part of Peirce\u2019s pragmatism, his\ngreater understanding of the interconnectedness of his thought led him\nto realize that they were also crucial to his work on semiotic. In\nparticular, he saw the three grades of clarity or understanding as\nreflected in his notion of the interpretant and of course felt that\nthe interpretant also had three grades or divisions. Peirce himself\nsays:\n\nIn the Second Part of my [\u201cHow To Make Our Ideas Clear\u201d],\nI made three grades of clearness of Interpretation. The first was such\nFamiliarity as gave a person familiarity with a sign and readiness in\nusing it or interpreting it. In his consciousness he seemed to himself\nto be quite at home with the Sign. [\u2026] The second was Logical\nAnalysis [and is equivalent to] Lady Welby\u2019s Sense. The third was\nPragmatistic Analysis [and is] identified with the Final Interpretant.\n(CP8 .185 1909).\n\n\nHere, then, Peirce identifies the first grade of clarity with the\ndynamic interpretant, the second grade with the immediate\ninterpretant, and the third grade with the final interpretant.\n4.2.1 The Immediate Interpretant\n\nAs its identification with the second grade of clarity suggests, the\nimmediate interpretant is a general definitional understanding of the\nrelationship between the sign and dynamic object. In an extended\nexample, where the dynamic object is the weather on a stormy day,\nPeirce describes the immediate interpretant as \u201cthe schema in\n[our] imagination, i.e. the vague Image of what there is in common to\nthe different images of a stormy day\u201d (CP8 .314 1907). The\nimmediate interpretant, then, is something like recognition of the\nsyntax of the sign and the more general features of its meaning.\nIndeed, Peirce seems to take the immediate interpretant to be\n\u201call that is explicit in the sign apart from its context and\ncircumstances of utterance\u201d (CP5 .473 1907). Also instructive\nis David Savan\u2019s description of the immediate interpretant as the:\n\nexplicit content of the sign which would enable a person to say\nwhether or not the sign was applicable to anything concerning which\nthat person had sufficient acquaintance. It is the total unanalyzed\nimpression which the sign might be expected to produce, prior to any\ncritical reflection upon it. (Savan 1988, 53).\n\n\nIn terms of an example where ordinary sentences are the signs, the\nimmediate interpretant will involve something like our recognition of\ngrammatical categories, syntactic structures and conventional rules of\nuse. For instance, without knowing anything about its context of\nutterance, we can surmise certain things about the sentence, \u201cwe\ndon\u2019t want to hurt him, do we?\u201d. We know it is a question, we\nknow it concerns doing harm to some person, a male, and so on. These\nthings are part of the immediate interpretant of the sign.\n4.2.2 The Dynamic Interpretant\n\nThe second type of interpretant that any sign must have is the dynamic\ninterpretant. This is our understanding of the sign/dynamic object\nrelationship at some actual instance in the chain of signs. Peirce\ndescribes the dynamic interpretant as the \u201ceffect actually\nproduced on the mind\u201d (CP8 .343 1908), or as the \u201cactual\neffect which the sign, as a sign, really determines\u201d (CP4 .536\n1906). The dynamic interpretant, then, is the understanding we\nreach, or which the sign determines, at any particular semiotic\nstage.\n\nTo continue with linguistic examples, we know that the dynamic\ninterpretant is the actual interpretation we make, or understanding we\nreach, in the first instance of interpretation. For instance, when you\nsay to me whilst pointing at some cowardly woman we know, \u201cI saw\nher duck under the table\u201d, the dynamic interpretant is my\nunderstanding that you are the utterer, that I am the addressee, and\nthat you saw our cowardly acquaintance hide beneath a table.\n\nThere is also an interesting connection between the dynamic\ninterpretant and the immediate object. As the understanding we\nactually reach at any particular point in the sign chain, the dynamic\ninterpretant represents an incomplete understanding, or\ninterpretation, of the dynamic object. More important, though, is that\nthe immediate object of some sign in a sign chain consists of the\nactual interpretations made previously, that is, it consists of the\ndynamic interpretants from earlier stages in the sign chain. As\nRansdell (1977, 169) puts it, the \u201cimmediate object is, in other\nwords, the funded result of all interpretation prior to the\ninterpretation of the given sign\u201d. The dynamic interpretant\nthen, is the actual interpretation or understanding we make at some\npoint in the semiotic process, and also constitutes, along with\nprevious dynamic interpretants, the immediate object, or partial\nunderstanding we have of the dynamic object at any particular point in\nthe semiotic process.\n4.2.3 The Final Interpretant\n\nPeirce describes the final interpretant as, \u201cthat which would\nfinally be decided to be the true interpretation if consideration of\nthe matter were carried so far that an ultimate opinion were\nreached\u201d (CP8 .184 1909). Elsewhere he describes it as the\n\u201ceffect that would be produced on the mind by the sign after\nsufficient development of thought\u201d (CP8 .343 1908). The final\ninterpretant, then, seems to be what our understanding of the dynamic\nobject would be at the end of inquiry, that is, if we had a reached a\ntrue understanding of the dynamic object. Peirce\u2019s notion of inquiry\nis clearly central here. As Hookway points out, we might best define\nthe final interpretant as the understanding:\n\nwhich would be reached if a process of enriching the interpretant\nthrough scientific enquiry were to proceed indefinitely. It\nincorporates a complete and true conception of the objects of the\nsign; it is the interpretant we should all agree on in the long run.\n(Hookway 1985, 139).\n\n\nAs an example, consider again the kinds of utterance that we have\nalready looked at. In such a case as your uttering, \u201cI saw her\nduck under the table\u201d, the final interpretant would be the\nunderstanding where there is \u201cno latitude of interpretation at\nall\u201d (CP5 .447 1905), that is, where the meanings of the\nwords, the identity of the agents involved and so on, are absolutely\ndeterminate. So, the final interpretant of your utterance of \u201cI\nsaw her duck under the table\u201d is my coming to a determinate\nunderstanding of what you mean. We can envisage how this would come\nabout, by my asking a variety of questions, like \u201care you using\n\u2018duck\u2019 as a verb or a noun?\u201d, or even \u201care you\ntalking to me?\u201d and developing a series of dynamic interpretants\nthat get us closer and closer to the final interpretant.\n\nJust as the dynamic interpretant has clear connections with other\nelements of Peirce\u2019s semiotic, so too does the final interpretant. As\nshould be clear, from the connections that emerge from the notion of\ninquiry, the final interpretant interacts strongly with the dynamic\nobject. The final interpretant, then, is important to our\nunderstanding of the dynamic object in a couple of ways. First, it is\nthe point where our grasp of the dynamic object would be complete and,\naccording to Ransdell (1977, 169\u2013170), is where the immediate\nobject and the dynamic object coincide. This represents the full\nassimilation or integration of the dynamic object into our system of\nsigns. Second, the final interpretant functions as an exemplar or\nnormative standard by which we can judge our actual interpretative\nresponses to the sign. As David Savan puts it, \u201cPeirce\u2019s\nintention was to identify the third type of interpretant as providing\na norm or standard by which particular stages (Dynamical\nInterpretants) of an historical process may be judged.\u201d (Savan\n1988, 62).\n\nFrom the point of view of Peirce scholars, an interesting element of\nthis division of objects and interpretants is how it might be used to\ninform accounts of meaning raised in analytic philosophy of\nlanguage. Risto Hilpinen (2019), for instance, argues that we can see\nclear parallels between Peirce\u2019s immediate object and\nFrege\u2019s notion of \u201csense\u201d. Atkin (2008a) suggests a\nrange of connections between Peirce\u2019s later division of objects\nand interpretants and analytic accounts of meaning and reference, and\neven identifies a historical connection between Peirce\u2019s\naccounts of signs and recent work on meaning by John Perry (Atkin\n2008b). (For other related work on Peirce\u2019s sign\ntheories as accounts of reference and meaning see Bellucci\n2021, Agler 2010, and Hilpinen 2015).\n4.3 Issues with the Final Account\n\nThis identification of the six elements of a sign is the clearest and\nleast controversial part of Peirce\u2019s final sign theories. Most of what\nwe know about Peirce\u2019s final account is gleaned from letters,\npartially worked out manuscripts and other miscellaneous items.\nConsequently, there is much to the final account that is still\nunclear, unsatisfactory, incomplete, and controversial. In this final\nsection, we shall look at two of the most interesting issues\nsurrounding the final account: Peirce\u2019s projected Final Classification\nof sixty-six signs; and what appears to be his identification of\nadditional interpretants.\n4.3.1 The Final Classification\n\nJust as the Early and Interim Accounts include a corresponding\nclassification of sign types, Peirce\u2019s final account holds similar\ntypological ambitions. Peirce states explicitly that there are\nsixty-six classes of sign in his final typology. (See EP2. 481).\nStrictly speaking, the six elements that we have detailed yield only\ntwenty eight sign types, but we are interested in Peirce\u2019s very final\ntypology. He believes that we can obtain these sixty-six classes,\nrather in the manner of the 1903 typology, by identifying ten elements\nof signs and signification, each of which has three qualifying\nclasses, and then working out their permissible combinations. These\nten elements include the six sign elements identified above, plus four\nother elements that focus on the relation between signs, objects and\ninterpretants. The ten elements and their respective sign types, taken\nfrom Peirce\u2019s 1908 letters to Lady Welby (EP2 483\u2013491), then,\nare as follows:\n\nIn respect of the Sign itself (what we have been calling the\nSign-Vehicle), a sign may be either a (i) Potisign (ii) Actisign or\n(iii) a Famisign.\n\n\n(By the time of the final accounts, Peirce was experimenting with\nterminology so these types are perhaps more familiar as Qualisigns,\nSinsigns and Legisigns).\n \nIn respect of the Immediate Object, a sign may be either i)\nDescriptive (ii) Designative or (iii) a Copulant.\nIn respect of the Dynamic Object, a sign may be either (i)\nAbstractive (ii) Concretive or (iii) Collective.\nIn respect of relation between the Sign and the Dynamic Object, a\nsign may be either, (i) an Icon (ii) an Index or (iii) a Symbol.\nIn respect of the Immediate Interpretant, a sign may be either (i)\nEjaculative, (ii) Imperative or (iii) Significative.\nIn respect of the Dynamic Interpretant, a sign may be either (i)\nSympathetic (ii) Shocking or (iii) Usual.\nIn respect of the relationship between the Sign and Dynamic\nInterpretant, a sign may be either (i) Suggestive (ii) Imperative or\n(iii) Indicative.\nIn respect of the Final Interpretant, a sign may be either, (i)\nGratiffic (ii) Action Producing or iii) Self-Control Producing.\nIn respect of the relation between the Sign and the Final\nInterpretant, a sign may be either a (i) Seme (ii) Pheme or (iii) a\nDelome.\nIn respect of the relation between the Sign, Dynamic Object and\nFinal Interpretant, a sign may be either (i) an Assurance of Instinct\n(ii) an Assurance of Experience or (iii) an Assurance of Form.\n\n\nThe reason that Peirce believes these ten elements will yield\nsixty-six classes is clear enough, the same combinatorial\nconsiderations given for the interim typology (outlined above in 3.4)\napply here. However, the precise manner and order in which these\nelements interact will determine what the sixty-six classes of signs\nwill look like in the final typology. Unfortunately, these ten\ndivisions and their classes represent a baffling array of\nunder-explained terminology, and there is little to indicate precisely\nhow we should set about the task of combining them. Even though we may\nbe confident on the number of signs in the final typology, other\ndetails are sketchy and underdeveloped, and there still exists no\nfully satisfactory account of the sixty-six classes. As Nathan Houser\npoints out, \u201ca sound and detailed extension of Peirce\u2019s analysis\nof signs to his full set of ten divisions and sixty-six classes is\nperhaps the most pressing problem for Peircian semiotics\u201d.\n(Houser 1992, 502).\n\nThere is, of course, good work on the final typology (see (Burks and\nWeiss 1949), (Sanders 1970), (Savan 1988), (Jappy 1989), (Jappy 2017),\n(Short 2007), (Muller 1994), and (Farias and Queiroz 2003) for the\nbest of this work), but ultimately, it is not clear that any account\nwill overcome the problems posed by the incomplete and cursory nature\nof the final account. Indeed, it is not clear that Peirce himself was\nfully at ease with his final typology and how its elements should hang\ntogether. As he himself said:\n\nThe ten divisions appear to me to be all Trichotomies; but it is\npossible that none of them are properly so. Of these ten Trichotomies,\nI have a clear apprehension of some, an unsatisfactory and doubtful\nnotion of others, and a tolerable but not thoroughly tried conception\nof others. (EP2. 483)\n\n\nDespite Peirce\u2019s own admission of doubts here, there is an\nongoing concern among Peirce scholars to determine the\nimportance of the later account and typology. Amongst the more\npositive positions in this debate, we see arguments that\nPeirce\u2019s later typology is crucial to a full understanding and\napplication of semiotics (see Quieroz 2012), or claims that it\nwhilst underdeveloped, it holds promise and deserves serious effort\nand attention (see Houser 1992 and Jappy 2017). More pessimistic\nPeirce scholars hold that the typology is either incoherent (see\nShort 2007), or that as an increasingly narrow classificatory\nproject, it runs counter to the more emergent and systemic properties\nof Peirce\u2019s semiotics (see Lizska 2019).\n4.3.2 Additional Interpretants\n\nAs is common with all of Peirce\u2019s work in philosophy, various changes\nin terminology and subtleties with accompanying neologisms occur from\none piece of work to the next. His work on interpretants is no\ndifferent. At various points in his final accounts of signs, Peirce\ndescribes the division of interpretants as being: immediate, dynamic\nand final; or as emotional, energetic, and logical; or as na\u00efve,\nrogate and normal; or as intentional, effective and communicational;\nor even destinate, effective and explicit. As Liszka (1990, 20) notes,\n\u201cthe received view in Peirce scholarship suggests that the\ndivisions of interpretant into immediate, dynamic, and final are\narchetypal, all other divisions being relatively synonymous with these\ncategories.\u201d There are, however, some dissenters from this\nview.\n\nIn discussing the interpretant, Peirce describes one of the\ntrichotomies above as follows:\n\nIn all cases [the Interpretant] includes feelings; for there must, at\nleast, be a sense of comprehending the meaning of the sign. If it\nincludes more than mere feeling, it must evoke some kind of effort. It\nmay include something besides, which, for the present, may be vaguely\ncalled \u201cthought\u201d. I term these three kinds of interpretant\nthe \u201cemotional\u201d, the \u201cenergetic\u201d, and the\n\u201clogical\u201d interpretants. (EP2. 409)\n\n\nFor some scholars, this describes a division distinct from the\nimmediate/dynamic/final trichotomy. Fitzgerald (1966, 78) claims that\nsince emotional, energetic and logical interpretants are actual\neffects, they must be seen as three sub-types of the dynamic\ninterpretant. This is because dynamic interpretants are described by\nPeirce as the effect actually produced on the mind. Short (1981, 1996,\nand 2004) thinks that each of the immediate, dynamic and final\ninterpretants may be further sub-divided into emotional, energetic and\nlogical. In particular, Short thinks that the immediate/dynamic/final\ntrichotomy describes the interpretant at some stage of an end-directed\nsemiotic process, whereas the emotional/energetic/logical trichotomy\ndescribes the types of interpretant possible at any given stage.\n\nThere are simple textual reasons that count against Fitzgerald\u2019s\nclaims. For instance, Peirce describes the dynamic interpretant as\nderiving its character from action (CP8 .315 1904), but later says,\n\u201caction cannot be a logical interpretant\u201d (CP5 .491\n1906). This seems to make the two inconsistent. (See Liszka (1990,\n21) for more on the problems with Fitzgerald\u2019s claim). Moreover, this\ninconsistency seems to suggest a problem for Short\u2019s view since his\naccount also suggests that the dynamic interpretant should include the\nlogical interpretant as a subdivision (Short 1981, 213). Short,\nhowever, claims textual support for his own view from instances where\nPeirce mentions the emotional/energetic/logical trichotomy alongside\nthe apparently separate claim that signs have three interpretants.\n(Short sites (CP8 .333 1904) and (CP4 .536 1906). Short takes this\nas suggesting that the two should be treated as different and distinct\ntrichotomies. (Short 2004, 235).\n\nHow far the textual evidence on the matter will prove decisive is\nunclear, especially given the fragmentary nature of Peirce\u2019s final\nwork on signs. However, one or two things militate in favor of the\n\u201creceived view\u201d. First, Peirce is notorious for\nexperimenting with terminology, especially when trying to pin down his\nown ideas, or describe the same phenomenon from different angles.\nSecond, it is unclear why trichotomies like the\nintentional/effectual/communicational should count as terminological\nexperiments whilst the emotional/energetic/logical counts as a\ndistinct division. And finally, there is little provision in Peirce\u2019s\nprojected sixty-six classes of signs for the kind of additional\nclassifications imposed by further subdivisions of the interpretant.\n(For more on this discussion see, Liszka 1990 and 1996; Fitzgerald\n1966; Lalor 1997; Short 1981, 1996, and 2004).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"PriLit\">Primary Literature</a>", "<a name=\"SecLit\">Secondary Literature</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a name=\"PriLit\">Primary Literature</a>": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Peirce, C.S., 1883. <em>Studies in Logic, by Members of The Johns\nHopkins University</em>.
