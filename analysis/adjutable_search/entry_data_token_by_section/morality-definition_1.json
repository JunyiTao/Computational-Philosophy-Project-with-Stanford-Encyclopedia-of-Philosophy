    "main_text": "Descriptive Definitions of \u201cMorality\u201d\n2. Descriptive Definitions of \u201cMorality\u201d\n\nAn initial na\u00efve attempt at a descriptive definition of\n\u201cmorality\u201d might take it to refer to the most important\ncode of conduct put forward by a society and accepted by the members\nof that society. But the existence of large and heterogeneous\nsocieties raises conceptual problems for such a descriptive\ndefinition, since there may not be any such society-wide code that is\nregarded as most important. As a result, a definition might be offered\nin which \u201cmorality\u201d refers to the most important code of\nconduct put forward and accepted by any group, or even by an\nindividual. Apart from containing some prohibitions on harming\n(certain) others, different moralities\u2014when\n\u201cmorality\u201d is understood in this way\u2014can vary in\ncontent quite substantially.\n\nEtiquette is sometimes included as a part of morality, applying to\nnorms that are considered less serious than the kinds of norms for\nbehavior that are more central to morality. Hobbes expresses this sort\nof view when he uses the term \u201csmall morals\u201d to describe\n\u201cdecency of behavior, as how one man should salute another, or\nhow a man should wash his mouth or pick his teeth before\ncompany\u201d, and distinguishes these from \u201cthose qualities of\nmankind that concern their living together in peace and unity\u201d\n(1660 [1994]: Chapter XI, paragraph 1). When etiquette is included as\npart of morality, morality is almost always being understood in the\ndescriptive sense. One reason for this is that it is clear that the\nrules of etiquette are relative to a society or group. Moreover, there\nare no plausible conditions under which we could pick out the\n\u201ccorrect\u201d rules of etiquette as those that would be\naccepted by all rational beings.\n\nLaw is distinguished from morality by having explicit written rules,\npenalties, and officials who interpret the laws and apply the\npenalties. Although there is often considerable overlap in the conduct\ngoverned by morality and that governed by law, laws are often\nevaluated\u2014and changed\u2014on moral grounds. Some theorists,\nincluding Ronald Dworkin (1986), have even maintained that the\ninterpretation of law must make use of morality.\n\nAlthough the morality of a group or society may derive from its\nreligion, morality and religion are not the same thing, even in that\ncase. Morality is only a guide to conduct, whereas religion is always\nmore than this. For example, religion includes stories about events in\nthe past, usually about supernatural beings, that are used to explain\nor justify the behavior that it prohibits or requires. Although there\nis often a considerable overlap in the conduct prohibited or required\nby religion and that prohibited or required by morality, religions may\nprohibit or require more than is prohibited or required by guides to\nbehavior that are explicitly labeled as moral guides, and may\nrecommend some behavior that is prohibited by morality. Even when\nmorality is not regarded as the code of conduct that is put forward by\na formal religion, it is often thought to require some religious\nexplanation and justification. However, just as with law, some\nreligious practices and precepts are criticized on moral grounds,\ne.g., that the practice or precept involves discrimination on the\nbasis of race, gender, or sexual orientation.\n\nWhen \u201cmorality\u201d is used simply to refer to a code of\nconduct put forward by an actual group, including a society, even if\nit is distinguished from etiquette, law, and religion, it is being\nused in a descriptive sense. It is also being used in the descriptive\nsense when it refers to important attitudes of individuals. Just as\none can refer to the morality of the Greeks, so one can refer to the\nmorality of a particular person. This descriptive use of\n\u201cmorality\u201d is now becoming more prominent because of the\nwork of psychologists such as Jonathan Haidt (2006), who have been\ninfluenced by the views of David Hume (1751), including his attempt to\npresent a naturalistic account of moral judgments.\n\nGuides to behavior that are regarded as moralities normally involve\navoiding and preventing harm to others (Frankena 1980), and perhaps\nsome norm of honesty (Strawson 1961). But all of them involve other\nmatters as well, and Hare\u2019s view of morality as that which is\nmost important allows that these other matters may be more important\nthan avoiding and preventing harm to others (Hare 1952, 1963, 1981).\nThis view of morality as concerning that which is most important to a\nperson or group allows matters related to religious practices and\nprecepts, or matters related to customs and traditions, e.g., purity\nand sanctity, to be more important than avoiding and preventing\nharm.\n\nWhen \u201cmorality\u201d is used in a descriptive sense, moralities\ncan differ from each other quite extensively in their content and in\nthe foundation that members of the society claim their morality to\nhave. Some societies may claim that their morality, which is more\nconcerned with purity and sanctity, is based on the commands of God.\nThe descriptive sense of \u201cmorality\u201d, which allows for the\nview that morality is based on religion in this way, picks out codes\nof conduct that are often in significant conflict with all normative\naccounts of morality.\n\nA society might have a morality that takes accepting its traditions\nand customs, including accepting the authority of certain people and\nemphasizing loyalty to the group, as more important than avoiding and\npreventing harm. Such a morality might not count as immoral any\nbehavior that shows loyalty to the preferred group, even if that\nbehavior causes significant harm to innocent people who are not in\nthat group. The familiarity of this kind of morality, which makes\nin-group loyalty almost equivalent to morality, seems to allow some\ncomparative and evolutionary psychologists, including Frans De Waal\n(1996), to regard non-human animals to be acting in ways very similar\nto those that are regarded as moral.\n\nAlthough all societies include more than just a concern for minimizing\nharm to (some) human beings in their moralities, this feature of\nmorality, unlike purity and sanctity, or accepting authority and\nemphasizing loyalty, is included in everything that is regarded as a\nmorality by any society. Because minimizing harm can conflict with\naccepting authority and emphasizing loyalty, there can be fundamental\ndisagreements within a society about the morally right way to behave\nin particular kinds of situations. Philosophers such as Bentham (1789)\nand Mill (1861), who accept a normative account of morality that takes\nthe avoiding and preventing harm element of morality to be most\nimportant, criticize all actual moralities (referred to by\n\u201cmorality\u201d in the descriptive sense) that give precedence\nto purity and loyalty when they are in conflict with avoiding and\npreventing harm.\n\nSome psychologists, such as Haidt, take morality to include concern\nwith, at least, all three of the triad of (1) harm, (2) purity, and\n(3) loyalty, and hold that different members of a society can and do\ntake different features of morality to be most important. But beyond a\nconcern with avoiding and preventing such harms to members of certain\ngroups, there may be no common content shared by all moralities in the\ndescriptive sense. Nor may there be any common justification that\nthose who accept morality claim for it; some may appeal to religion,\nothers to tradition, and others to rational human nature. Beyond the\nconcern with harm, the only other feature that all descriptive\nmoralities have in common is that they are put forward by an\nindividual or a group, usually a society, in which case they provide a\nguide for the behavior of the people in that group or society. In the\ndescriptive sense of \u201cmorality\u201d, morality may not even\nincorporate impartiality with regard to all moral agents, and it may\nnot be universalizable in any significant way (compare MacIntyre\n1957).\n\nAlthough most philosophers do not use \u201cmorality\u201d in any of\nthe above descriptive senses, some philosophers do. Ethical\nrelativists such as Harman (1975), Westermarck (1960), and Prinz\n(2007), deny that there is any universal normative morality and claim\nthat the actual moralities of societies or individuals are the only\nmoralities there are. These relativists hold that only when the term\n\u201cmorality\u201d is used in this descriptive sense is there\nsomething that \u201cmorality\u201d actually refers to. They claim\nthat it is a mistake to take \u201cmorality\u201d to refer to a\nuniversal code of conduct that, under certain conditions, would be\nendorsed by all rational persons. Although ethical relativists admit\nthat many speakers of English use \u201cmorality\u201d to refer to\nsuch a universal code of conduct, they claim such persons are mistaken\nin thinking that there is anything that is the referent of the word\n\u201cmorality\u201d taken in that sense.\n\nWong (1984, 2006, 2014) claims to be an ethical relativist because he\ndenies that there is any universal moral code that would be endorsed\nby all rational people. But what seems to stand behind this claim is\nthe idea that there are cultural variations in the relative weights\ngiven to, for example, considerations of justice and considerations of\ninterpersonal responsibility. And he assumes that those who believe in\na universal morality are committed to the idea that \u201cif there is\nfundamental disagreement, someone has got it wrong\u201d (2014: 339).\nBut Gert (2005) is certainly not a relativist, and it is central to\nhis moral theory that there are fundamental disagreements in the\nrankings of various harms and benefits, and with regard to who is\nprotected by morality, and no unique right answer in such cases. Wong\nhimself is willing to say that some moralities are better than others,\nbecause he thinks that the moral domain is delimited by a functional\ncriterion: among the functions of a morality are that it promote and\nregulate social cooperation, help individuals rank their own\nmotivations, and reduce harm.\n\nWhen used with its descriptive sense, \u201cmorality\u201d can refer\nto codes of conduct with widely differing content, and still be used\nunambiguously. This parallels the way in which \u201claw\u201d is\nused unambiguously even though different societies have laws with\nwidely differing content. However, when \u201cmorality\u201d is used\nin its descriptive sense, it sometimes does not refer to the code of a\nsociety, but to the code of a group or an individual. As a result,\nwhen the guide to conduct put forward by, for example, a religious\ngroup conflicts with the guide to conduct put forward by a society, it\nis not clear whether to say that there are conflicting moralities,\nconflicting elements within morality, or that the code of the\nreligious group conflicts with morality.\n\nIn small homogeneous societies there may be a guide to behavior that\nis put forward by the society and that is accepted by (almost) all\nmembers of the society. For such societies there is (almost) no\nambiguity about which guide \u201cmorality\u201d refers to. However,\nin larger societies people often belong to groups that put forward\nguides to behavior that conflict with the guide put forward by their\nsociety, and members of the society do not always accept the guide put\nforward by their society. If they accept the conflicting guide of some\nother group to which they belong (often a religious group) rather than\nthe guide put forward by their society, in cases of conflict they will\nregard those who follow the guide put forward by their society as\nacting immorally.\n\nIn the descriptive sense of \u201cmorality\u201d, a person\u2019s\nown morality cannot be a guide to behavior that that person would\nprefer others not to follow. However, that fact that an individual\nadopts a moral code of conduct for his own use does not entail that\nthe person requires it to be adopted by anyone else. An\nindividual may adopt for himself a very demanding moral guide that he\nthinks may be too difficult for most others to follow. He may judge\npeople who do not adopt his code of conduct as not being as morally\ngood as he is, without judging them to be immoral if they do not adopt\nit. However, such cases do not undermine the restriction; a guide is\nplausibly referred to as a morality only when the individual would be\nwilling for others to follow it, at least if\n\u201cfollow\u201d is taken to mean \u201csuccessfully\nfollow\u201d. For it may be that the individual would not be willing\nfor others to try to follow that code, because of worries\nabout the bad effects of predictable failures due to partiality or\nlack of sufficient foresight or intelligence.\n",
