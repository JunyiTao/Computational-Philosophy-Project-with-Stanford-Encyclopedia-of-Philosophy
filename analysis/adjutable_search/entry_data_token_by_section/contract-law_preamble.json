    "main_text": "\n\nThe law of contracts, at least in its orthodox expression, concerns\nvoluntary, or chosen, legal obligations. When Brody accepts\nSusan\u2019s offer to sell him a canoe for a set price, the\nparties\u2019 choices alter their legal rights and duties. Their\nsuccess at changing the legal landscape depends on a background system\nof rules that specify when and how contractual acts have legal\neffects, rules that give the offer and acceptance of a\nbargain-exchange a central role in generating obligations. Contract\nlaw conceived as a body of rules empowering individuals to shape their\nown rights and responsibilities presents an object of philosophical\nstudy.\n\nThe philosophy of contract includes two broad sets of projects. One\nset, the focus of the first part of this entry, targets the basic\nstructure and normative justification of the law of contracts. The aim\nis to subsume a salient body of contract law rules under general\nprinciples in order to clarify contract law\u2019s conceptual\ncategories, distinguish it from other areas of law, and specify\ncriteria relevant to its normative appraisal. This kind of\nphilosophical work presupposes detailed knowledge of the law in\nexisting legal regimes, and the entry begins by outlining the common\nlaw of contracts.\n\nA second set of projects draws on resources from the philosophy of\nlanguage, philosophy of action, and moral and political philosophy to\naddress debates within contract law. Questions about the nature of\nmeaning and interpretation, intentionality, freedom in contract, and\ndistributive justice drive contemporary legal debates concerning\ncontract formation, interpretation, and enforcement. Philosophical\nwork on these topics has attracted significant commentary which serves\nas the focus of the second part of this entry.\n",
