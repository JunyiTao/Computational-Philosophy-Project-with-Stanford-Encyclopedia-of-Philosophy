Skepticism: method or doctrine\n\n\nThe central question presented by the inconsistent evidence for\nArcesilaus\u2019 skepticism is how to reconcile his Socratic method\nwith the \u2018doctrines\u2019 he is reported to have accepted:\n\nthat nothing can be known (inapprehensibility, or\n\u2018akatal\u00eapsia\u2019 in Greek);\nthat one should suspend assent universally and so form no beliefs\n(universal suspension of assent, or \u2018epoch\u00ea\nperi pant\u00f4n\u2019); and\nthat one who universally suspends assent still has a \u2018practical\ncriterion\u2019 of action.\n\n\n\nOur sources agree that Arcesilaus\u2019 dialectical method\nconstituted the core of his philosophical activity (see e.g., Diogenes\nLaertius 4.28). This method presents two basic difficulties for any\nattempt to reconcile it with these doctrines.\n\n\nFirst, his method was dialectical, such that rather than arguing in\nfavor of any doctrine or set of doctrines, Arcesilaus restricted\nhimself to arguing against the views proposed by his opponents or\ninterlocutors. At first sight, this method may not look incompatible\nwith affirming inapprehensibility\u00a0and universal\nsuspension of assent\u00a0if the repeated result of practicing it\nwas that the views argued against did not stand up to criticism. Such\nrepeated failures could suggest that in fact nothing can be known and\nthat one should form no beliefs at all.\n\n\nWe can see why Arcesilaus\u2019 dialectical method cautions against\naccepting this suggestion by looking at the model he claimed to be\nfollowing: Socrates\u2019 practice in the dialogues of Plato (see\nCicero, Academica 1.44\u20135, De oratore 3.67,\nDe finibus 2.2, On the Nature of the Gods 1.11). In\nPlato\u2019s Socratic dialogues, at least, Socrates challenges the\npretensions of his interlocutors to knowledge by showing, through\npremises they accept, that they are committed to inconsistent beliefs.\nTo achieve this result, it is crucial that the arguments\u2014the\npremises, the inferences, and the conclusions\u2014depend entirely on\nthe beliefs of the interlocutors. If they do, the result of a\nsuccessful Socratic encounter will be that the interlocutor is at a\nloss: the interlocutors now recognize that they have inconsistent\nbeliefs, since they have both their initial reasons for the thesis or\nknowledge-claim they made and their newly-discerned reasons against\nit.  If they also hold some generally accepted views about knowledge\n(for example, that one can\u2019t know something about which one holds\ninconsistent beliefs), the interlocutors will be rationally\nconstrained to aver that they don\u2019t know whether their thesis is true\nor false, and hence to suspend assent on the thesis while awaiting\nfurther investigation and argument. But no such result holds for\nSocrates. For, although he represents himself as being in the same\naporetic boat\u2014and may in fact be perplexed for exactly the same\nreasons\u2014his method does not commit him to the premises,\ninferences or conclusions of the arguments, or even to the regulating\nideas about knowledge. His views (if he has any) are not at issue in\nthe argument.\n\n\nThere is good evidence that Arcesilaus followed the Socratic model\nconsistently. It is clear that he went to some lengths not to make\npositive affirmations of any sort in his own right in his arguments\n(see Diogenes Laertius 4.36, Philodemus Index Academicorum\n20.1\u20134, cf. 18.40\u201319.9). Our sources also confirm that\nArcesilaus took his method to entail that he did not reveal his own\nview on the matter in question in any case, if he had one, including,\nfor instance, the view that the claim argued against is false (see\ne.g., Cicero\u00a0De oratore\u00a03.67). Further, our most\ndetailed sources actually identify the radical change of position in\nthe Platonic school he introduced\u2014the transition from the Old\nAcademy to the skeptical Academy\u2014in terms of his adoption of\nthis method (see Diogenes Laertius 4.28, Philodemus Index\nAcademicorum 18.7\u201316 & 21.36\u201342 and Sextus\nOutlines of Pyrrhonism 1.220\u201335, esp. 232). And this\nexplains his reputation as a \u2018dialectician\u2019 (or, more\nnegatively, as a \u2018sophist\u2019 or \u2018eristic\u2019 or\n\u2018magician\u2019), as well as why the skeptical Academy came to\nbe defined primarily by its critical stance towards the doctrines of\nother schools (and particularly towards the energetic philosophical\nprograms of the new movements initiated by Epicurus and Zeno during his\nlifetime). But if Arcesilaus followed this model consistently by\narguing against every philosophical position that came to his notice\nand refraining from making any positive arguments or affirmations on\nany philosophical question, it is hard to see why we should think that\nhe accepted any doctrines, including inapprehensibility and\nuniversal suspension of assent. Thus, the first difficulty is\nthat Arcesilaus\u2019 method in principle obscures any views he may\nhave held.\n\n\nThe second difficulty involved in reconciling Arcesilaus\u2019\ndialectical method with doctrines [i]\u2013[iii] is more\nstraightforward: they are conclusions of some of his best known\narguments, but since these are clearly dialectical anti-Stoic\narguments, they depend crucially on Stoic premises. In epistemology, he\nargued that, despite the Stoics\u2019 commitment to readily accessible\nknowledge, certain premises accepted by the Stoics entail that nothing\nis known and that we should suspend assent universally (see below,\nsect. 3.). Likewise, the theory of action Arcesilaus defended is\nparasitic on the Stoics\u2019 and relies on their ethical premises\n(see below, sect. 5). Given his Socratic method, we only have reason to\nascribe these doctrines to Arcesilaus himself if we have independent\nevidence that he accepted those premises shared by Stoics. But there is\nreason to think that Arcesilaus did not accept anything of Stoic\nepistemology or ethics. The second difficulty, then, is that the\nevidence does not give a consistent picture of which, if any,\nconclusions of his dialectical arguments Arcesilaus may have accepted\nin his own right.\n\n\nThe first question about Arcesilaus\u2019 skepticism is thus\nwhether it involved any commitment to doctrines at all. A negative\nanswer to this question\u2014based on something like the two\ndifficulties given above\u2014yields what is called a\ndialectical interpretation of Arcesilaus (adopted by e.g.,\nCouissin 1929 and Striker 1980; see Castagnoli 2018 on the senses of\n\u2018dialectical\u2019). The primary drawback to this interpretation\nis that it involves the rejection of a central claim about him in all\nof our major sources except Philodemus: Cicero, Numenius, Sextus,\nDiogenes and Plutarch ascribe some degree of commitment to at least one\nof these doctrines\u2014that of universal suspension ([ii]\nabove). Rejecting this evidence might be justified by the lateness of\nthese sources and their associations with later Academic developments;\nbut this seems hard to maintain when we learn that Arcesilaus\u2019\ncontemporary opponents, including Chrysippus, also ascribed\nuniversal suspension to him (see Plutarch On\nStoic Self-Contradictions 1036a with 1037a, and Against\nColotes 1122a). A dialectical interpretation also risks failing\nas an interpretation: it cannot explain why Arcesilaus argued\nas he did, whether because it denies him any commitments or because it\nclaims they are entirely opaque to us (see Perin 2013).\n\n\nIf we accept that these considerations constrain us to look for a\npositive answer to the first question, at least as regards the\nrecommendation of suspending assent about everything, the second\nquestion is which of the three candidate doctrines\u2014viz., [i]\ninapprehensibility, [ii] universal suspension, and\n[iii] a theory of action without assent\u2014was Arcesilaus\ncommitted to. Since, as numerous sources suggest, universal\nsuspension is the prescriptive claim that one ought not to form\nany beliefs, then Arcesilaus cannot follow it and at the same time\nbelieve it, or anything else, to be true. If we do not wish to saddle\nArcesilaus with a self-defeating skepticism, we are then faced with a\nthird question: what was the nature of Arcesilaus\u2019 commitment to\nhis doctrines? The answers to these two questions remain open. But the\ndominant solutions on offer fall roughly into three groups, each\nidentifying a different kind of commitment compatible with\nuniversal suspension, and so a different answer to the third\nquestion. If the sort of commitment prohibited by universal\nsuspension is rational belief, then three weaker kinds of\ncommitment seem to have been open to Arcesilaus:\n\nNon-Rational\nNon-Belief (\u2018NRNB\u2019): a commitment to\np, which neither is a belief that p nor is based on\nreasons.\nRational\nNon-Belief (\u2018RNB\u2019): a commitment to\np, which is not a belief that p but is based on\nreasons.\nNon-Rational\nBelief (\u2018NRB\u2019): a commitment to p,\nwhich is a belief that p but is not based on reasons.\n\n\nNRNB supposes that the skeptic universally suspends assent\nas a natural, psychological reaction to equally convincing (or\nequipollent) and opposing arguments. Universal suspension, on\nthis view, is not a prescription justified through the\nargument that one ought to suspend assent about everything because\nknowledge is impossible. Rather, since the skeptic\u2019s belief-forming faculties are\nparalyzed in the face of opposing reasons, she acts by impulse,\npursuing what appears appropriate (see sect. 5.1). On an NRNB\ninterpretation Arcesilaus\u2019 commitments to [ii] universal\nsuspension and [iii] a practical criterion were founded neither on\nbelief nor on a prior consideration of reasons (see e.g., Ioppolo 1986;\n2009; 2018).\n\nRNB allows the skeptic to accept doctrines on rational\ngrounds, by distinguishing beliefs from other attitudes that can take the\nplace of beliefs in chains of inference: in particular,\nbelief-like suppositions that function as hypotheses (see Striker 1980,\nBett 1990, and Reinhardt 2018). On the RNB view Arcesilaus\naccepted [i]\u2013[iii] hypothetically (see Schofield 1999, Perin\n2010, and Thorsrud 2018).\n\nNRB denies the skeptic accepts doctrines on the basis of\nany premises that purport to warrant them. On this view, [i]\ninapprehensibility and [ii] universal suspension were\nthe residual and rationally unwarranted beliefs Arcesilaus was left\nwith as a result of his philosophical activity (see Frede 1979 &\n1984, Cooper 2004, Brittain 2005 [2008], and Thorsrud 2009).\n\n\nAs we will see in sects. 4\u20135, these three accounts of\nArcesilaus\u2019 skepticism privilege the evidence for his arguments\nin competing ways. To understand and evaluate their interpretive\nstrategies, we first need to examine Arcesilaus\u2019 principal\narguments against Stoic epistemology.\n",
