    "main_text": "\n1. Inquiry Resistance\n\nIf you cut one head off of a two-headed man, have you decapitated him?\nWhat is the maximum height of a short man? When does a fertilized egg\ndevelop into a person?\n\nThese questions are impossible to answer because they involve absolute\nborderline cases. In the vast majority of cases, the unknowability of\na borderline statement is only relative to a given means of settling\nthe issue (Sorensen 2001, chapter 1). For instance, a boy may count as\na borderline case of \u2018obese\u2019 because people cannot tell\nwhether he is obese just by looking at him. His curious mother could\ntry to settle the matter by calculating her son\u2019s body mass\nindex. The formula is to divide his weight (in kilograms) by the\nsquare of his height (in meters). If the value exceeds 30, this test\ncounts him as obese. The calculation will itself leave some borderline\ncases. The mother could then use a weight-for-height chart. These\ncharts are not entirely decisive because they do not reflect the ratio\nof fat to muscle, whether the child has large bones, and so on. The\nboy will only count as an absolute borderline case of\n\u2018obese\u2019 if no possible method of inquiry could settle\nwhether he is obese. When we reach this stage, we start to suspect\nthat our uncertainty is due to the concept of obesity rather than to\nour limited means of testing for obesity.\n\nAbsolute borderline cases are first officially targeted by Charles\nSanders Peirce\u2019s entry for \u2018vague\u2019 in the 1902\nDictionary of Philosophy and Psychology:\n\nA proposition is vague when there are possible states of things\nconcerning which it is intrinsically uncertain whether, had\nthey been contemplated by the speaker, he would have regarded them as\nexcluded or allowed by the proposition. By intrinsically uncertain we\nmean not uncertain in consequence of any ignorance of the interpreter,\nbut because the speaker\u2019s habits of language were indeterminate.\n(Peirce 1902, 748)\n\n\nPeirce connects intrinsic uncertainty with the sorites paradox:\n\u201cvagueness is an indeterminacy in the applications of an idea,\nas to how many grains of sand are required to make a heap, and the\nlike\u201d (1892, 167). In the case of relative borderline cases, the\nquestion is determinate but our means for answering it are incomplete.\nFor absolute borderline cases, there is incompleteness in the question\nitself. When a term is applied to one of its absolute borderline cases\nthe result is a statement that resists all attempts to settle whether\nit is true or false (Hu 2021). For instance, no amount of conceptual\nanalysis or empirical inquiry can establish the minimum number of\ngrains needed for a heap. Equally futile is inquiry into the\nqualitative vagueness illustrated by the decapitation riddle. An\ninventive speaker could give the appearance of settling the matter by\nstipulating that \u2018decapitate\u2019 means \u2018remove a\nhead\u2019 (as opposed to \u2018make headless\u2019 or\n\u2018remove the head\u2019). But that semantic revision would\nchange the topic to an issue that merely sounds the same as\ndecapitation. The switch in meaning might not be detected if the\ninventive speaker was misperceived as merely applying antecedent\nknowledge of decapitation.\n\nWe should expect absolute borderline cases to arise for unfamiliar\ncases. Where there is no perceived need for a decision, criteria are\nleft undeveloped. Since philosophical thought experiments often\ninvolve unfamiliar cases, there is apt to be intrinsic uncertainty. W.\nV. O. Quine was especially suspicious of the far-out hypotheticals\npopular in the literature on personal identity. He globalizes his\ndoubts about determinate answers in his thesis of radical translation:\nfor any language, there are indefinitely many, equally adequate rival\ntranslation manuals.\n\nThe indeterminacy of translation applies to one\u2019s own language.\nIntrospection will not settle whether \u2018\\(x\\) is the same person\nas \\(y\\)\u2019 means \u2018\\(x\\) has the same body as \\(y\\)\u2019\nor \u2018\\(x\\) has same memories as \\(y\\)\u2019. You have never\nencountered a case in which these two possible rules of usage diverge.\nJohn Locke imagines a prince and cobbler who awake with each\nother\u2019s memories. Is the prince now in the cobbler\u2019s bed\nor is the prince in his royal bed with errant memories? Quine sees a\ndeflating resemblance with the decapitation riddle. Either of the\nincompatible answers fits past usage. Yet Locke answers that the\nprince and cobbler have switched bodies. Materialists counter that the\nprince and cobbler have instead switched psychologies. Locke and his\nadversary should have instead shrugged their shoulders.\n\nThe Cambridge University philosophers Bertrand Russell (1923) and\nFrank Ramsey were heavily influenced by American pragmatism (Misak\n2016). Their reading of Peirce made semantic indeterminacy grow into\nan international pre-occupation among analytic philosophers. Although\nvagueness seems holistic, Peirce\u2019s definition is reductive.\n\u2018Tall\u2019 is vague by virtue of there being cases in which\nthere is no fact of the matter. A man who is 1.8 meters in height is\nneither clearly tall nor clearly non-tall. No amount of conceptual\nanalysis or empirical investigation can settle whether a 1.8 meter man\nis tall. Borderline cases are inquiry resistant.\n\nInquiry resistance recurs. For in addition to the unclarity of the\nborderline case, there is normally unclarity as to where the unclarity\nbegins. Twilight governs times that are borderline between day and\nnight. But we are equally uncertain as to when twilight begins. This\nsuggests there are borderline cases of borderline cases of\n\u2018day\u2019. Consequently, \u2018borderline case\u2019 has\nborderline cases. This higher-order vagueness seems to show that\n\u2018vague\u2019 is vague (Hu 2017). We are slow to recognize\nhigher-order vagueness because we are under a norm to assert only what\nwe know. When we discuss cases of twilight, we focus on definite cases\nof this borderline between day and night, not the marginal cases\nbetween definite day and definite twilight.\n\nThe vagueness of \u2018vague\u2019 would have two destructive\nconsequences. First, Gottlob Frege could no longer coherently\ncharacterize vague predicates as incoherent. For this attribution of\nincoherence uses \u2018vague\u2019. Frege\u2019s ideal of precision\nis itself vague because \u2018precise\u2019 is the complement of\n\u2018vague\u2019. Second, the vagueness of \u2018vague\u2019\ndooms efforts to avoid a sharp line between true and false with a\nbuffer zone that is neither true nor false. If the line is not drawn\nbetween the true and the false, then it will be between the true and\nthe intermediate state. Any finite number of intermediates just delays\nthe inevitable.\n\nSeveral philosophers repudiate higher-order vagueness as an illusion\n(Wright 2021, chapter 5). They deny that there is an open-ended\niteration of borderline status. They find it telling that speakers do\nnot go around talking about borderline borderline cases and borderline\nborderline borderline cases and so forth (Raffman 2005, 23). Defenders\nof higher-order vagueness reply that ordinary speakers avoid iterating\n\u2018borderline\u2019 for the same reason they avoid iterating\n\u2018million\u2019 or \u2018know\u2019. The iterations are\nconfusing but perfectly meaningful. \u2018Borderline\u2019 behaves\njust like a vague predicate. For instance, \u2018borderline\u2019\ncan be embedded in a sorites argument. Defenders of higher-order\nvagueness have also tried to clinch the case with particular-specimens\nsuch as borderline hermaphrodites (reasoning that these individuals\nare borderline borderline males) (Sorensen 2010).\n\nSecond thoughts about higher-order vagueness are difficult to sustain\nunless one also rethinks first-order vagueness. Perhaps Peirce\noverreacted to the threat of futile inquiry! Where does the tail of a\nsnake begin? When posed as a rhetorical question, the speaker\nintimates that there is no definite answer. But the tail can be\nlocated by tracing down from the snake\u2019s rib cage. A false\nattribution of indeterminacy will lead to the premature abandonment of\ninquiry. Is heat the absence of cold or cold the absence of heat? Many\nphysicists ceased to inquire after Ernst Mach ridiculed the ancient\nriddle as indeterminate. Israel Scheffler (1979, 77\u201378) draws a\nmoral from such hasty desertions. Never give up! In an internal\ncriticism of his colleague Quine, Scheffler condemns any attribution\nof semantic indeterminacy as a defeatist relic of the distinction\nbetween analytic and synthetic statements. Appeals to meaning never\nconclude inquiry or preclude inquiry.\n\nNo one pursues the many lines of inquiry Scheffler refuses to close.\nYet some agree that the attribution of borderline status is never\nmandatory. Crispin Wright (2021) concludes there are no\ndefinite borderline cases. Diana Raffman (2014, 153) offers\nsome empirical support for borderline status always being optional. A\nminority of fluent speakers will draw a sharp line between yellow and\norange.\n\nMandatory status is defended by listing paradigm cases of\n\u2018borderline\u2019. Just as a language teacher tests for\ncompetence by having students distinguish clear positives from clear\nnegatives, she also tests by their recognition of borderline cases.\nAny pupil who uses \u2018-ish\u2019 without recognizing borderline\ncases of \u2018noonish\u2019 has not yet mastered the suffix.\n\u2018Noonish\u2019 is not a synonym of \u2018within ten minutes of\nnoon\u2019 or any other term with a precisely delimited interval.\n2. Comparison with Ambiguity and Generality\n\n\u2018Tall\u2019 is relative. A 1.8 meter pygmy is tall for a pygmy\nbut a 1.8 meter Masai is not tall for a Masai. Although relativization\ndisambiguates, it does not eliminate borderline cases. There are\nshorter pygmies who are borderline tall for a pygmy and taller Masai\nwho are borderline tall for a Masai. The direct bearers of vagueness\nare a word\u2019s full disambiguations such as \u2018tall for an\neighteenth-century French man\u2019. Words are only vague indirectly,\nby virtue of having a sense that is vague. In contrast, an ambiguous\nword bears its ambiguity directly\u2014simply in virtue of having\nmultiple meanings.\n\nThis contrast between vagueness and ambiguity is obscured by the fact\nthat most words are both vague and ambiguous. \u2018Child\u2019 is\nambiguous between \u2018offspring\u2019 and \u2018immature\noffspring\u2019. The latter reading of \u2018child\u2019 is vague\nbecause there are borderline cases of immature offspring. The contrast\nis further complicated by the fact that most words are also general.\nFor instance, \u2018child\u2019 covers both boys and girls.\n\nAmbiguity and vagueness also contrast with respect to the\nspeaker\u2019s discretion. If a word is ambiguous, the speaker can\nresolve the ambiguity without departing from literal usage. For\ninstance, he can declare that he meant \u2018child\u2019 to express\nthe concept of an immature offspring. If a word is vague, the speaker\ncannot resolve the borderline case. For instance, the speaker cannot\nmake \u2018child\u2019 literally mean anyone under eighteen just by\nintending it. That concept is not, as it were, on the menu\ncorresponding to \u2018child\u2019. He would be understood as taking\na special liberty with the term to suit a special purpose.\nAcknowledging departure from ordinary usage would relieve him of the\nobligation to defend the sharp cut-off.\n\nWhen the movie director Alfred Hitchcock mused \u2018All actors are\nchildren\u2019 he was taking liberties with clear negative cases of\n\u2018child\u2019 rather than its borderline cases. The aptness of\nhis generalization is not judged by its literal truth-value (because\nit is obviously untrue). Likewise, we do not judge precisifications of\nborderline cases by their truth-values (because they are obviously not\nascertainable as true or false). We instead judge precisifications by\ntheir simplicity, conservativeness, and fruitfulness. A\nprecisification that draws the line across the borderline cases\nconserves more paradigm usage than one that draws the line across\nclear cases. But conservatism is just one desideratum among many.\nSometimes the best balance is achieved at the cost of turning former\npositive cases into negative cases.\n\nOnce we shift from literal to figurative usage, we gain fictive\ncontrol over our entire vocabulary\u2014not just vague words. When a\ntravel agent says \u2018France is a hexagon\u2019, we do not infer\nthat she has committed the geometrical error of classifying France as\na six-sided polygon. We instead interpret the travel agent as speaking\nfiguratively, as meaning that France is shaped like a hexagon.\nSimilarly, when the travel agent says \u2018Reno is the biggest\nlittle city\u2019, we do not interpret her as overlooking the\nvagueness of \u2018little city\u2019. Just as she uses the obvious\nfalsehood of \u2018France is a hexagon\u2019 to signal a metaphor,\nshe uses the obvious indeterminacy of \u2018Reno is the biggest\nlittle city\u2019 to signal hyperbole.\n\nGiven that speakers lack any literal discretion over vague terms, we\nought not to chide them for indecisiveness. Where there is no decision\nto be made, there is no scope for vice. Speakers would have literal\ndiscretion if statements applying a predicate to its borderline cases\nwere just permissible variations in linguistic usage. For the sake of\ncomparison, consider discretion between alternative spellings.\nProfessor Letterman uses \u2018judgment\u2019 instead of\n\u2018judgement\u2019 because he wants to promote the principle that\na silent E signals a long vowel. He still has fond memories of Tom\nLehrer\u2019s 1971 children\u2019s song \u201cSilent E\u201d:\n\nWho can turn a can into a cane?\n\nWho can turn a pan into a pane?\n\nIt\u2019s not too hard to see,\n\nIt\u2019s Silent E.\n\n\nWho can turn a cub into a cube?\n\nWho can turn a tub into a tube?\n\nIt\u2019s elementary\n\nFor Silent E.\n\n\nProfessor Letterman disapproves of those who add the misleading E but\nconcedes that \u2018judgement\u2019 is a permissible spelling; he\ndoes not penalize his students for misspelling when they make their\nhard-hearted choice of \u2018judgement\u2019. Indeed, Professor\nLetterman scolds students if they fail to stick with the same spelling\nthroughout the composition. Choose but stick to your choice!\n\nProfessor Letterman\u2019s assertion \u2018The word for my favorite\nmental act is spelled j-u-d-g-m-e-n-t\u2019 is robust with respect to\nthe news that it is also spelled j-u-d-g-e-m-e-n-t. He would continue\nto assert it. He can conjoin the original assertion with information\nabout the alternative: \u2018The word for my favorite mental act is\nspelled j-u-d-g-m-e-n-t and is also spelled j-u-d-g-e-m-e-n-t\u2019.\nIn contrast, Professor Letterman\u2019s assertion that \u2018Martha\nis a woman\u2019 is not robust with respect to the news that Martha\nis a borderline case of \u2018woman\u2019 (say, Letterman learns\nMartha is younger than she looks). The new information would lead\nLetterman to retract his assertion in favor of a hedged remark such as\n\u2018Martha might be a woman and Martha might not be a woman\u2019.\nProfessor Letterman\u2019s loss of confidence is hard to explain if\nthe information about her borderline status were simply news of a\ndifferent but permissible way of describing her. Discoveries of\nnotational variants do not warrant changes in former beliefs.\n\nNews of borderline status has an evidential character. Loss of clarity\nbrings loss of warrant. If you do not lower your confidence, you are\nopen to the charge of dogmatism. To concede that your ferry is a\nborderline case of \u2018seaworthy\u2019 is to concede that you do\nnot know that your ship is seaworthy. That is why debates can be\ndissolved by showing that the dispute is over an absolute borderline\ncase. The debaters should both become agnostic. After all, they do not\nhave a license to form beliefs beyond their evidence. If your ferry is\nborderline seaworthy, you are not free to believe it is seaworthy.\n\nAccording to W. K. Clifford, belief beyond the evidence is always\nmorally forbidden, not just irrational. William James countered that\nbelief beyond the evidence is permissible when there is a forced,\nmomentous, live option. Can I survive the destruction of my body,\nsimply by virtue of a strong psychological resemblance with a future\nperson? The answer affects my prospects for immortality. James says\nthat my belief that this is borderline survival does not forbid me\nfrom believing that it is survival. Whether I exercise this\nprerogative depends on my temperament. Since momentous borderline\ncases are so prevalent in speculative matters, much philosophical\ndisagreement is a matter of personality differences.\n\nThe Clifford drop into agnosticism is especially quick for those who\nbelieve that evidence supports a unique judgment. A detective who\nthinks the evidence shows Gray is a murderer cannot concede that the\nevidence equally permits the judgment that Gray is not a murderer. If\nthe detective concedes that Gray\u2019s act is borderline murder,\nthen he cannot shed the hedge and believe the act is murder.\n\nIn the case of relative borderline cases, the hedge can be shed by the\ndiscovery of a novel species of evidence. Murder inquiries were\nsometimes inconclusive because the suspect had an identical twin.\nAfter detectives learned that identical twins have distinct\nfingerprints, some of these borderline cases became decidable.\nPresently, there are some borderline cases arising from the extreme\nsimilarity in DNA between identical twins. Soon, geneticists will be\nable to reliably discern the slight differences between twin DNA that\narise from mutations.\n\nNews of an alternative sense is like news of an alternative spelling;\nthere is no evidential impact (except for meta-linguistic beliefs\nabout the nature of words). Your assertion that \u2018All bachelors\nare men\u2019 is robust with respect to the news that\n\u2018bachelor\u2019 has an alternative sense in which it means a\nmale seal. Assertions are not robust with respect to news of hidden\ngenerality. If a South African girl says \u2018No elephant can be\ndomesticated\u2019 but learns there is another species of elephant\nindigenous to Asia, she will lose some confidence; maybe Asian\nelephants can be domesticated. News of hidden generality has\nevidential impact. When it comes to robustness, vagueness resembles\ngenerality more than vagueness resembles ambiguity.\n\nMathematical terms such as \u2018prime number\u2019 show that a term\ncan be general without being vague. A term can also be vague without\nbeing general. Borderline cases of analytically empty predicates\nillustrate this possibility.\n\nGenerality is obviously useful. Often, lessons about a particular\n\\(F\\) can be projected to other \\(F\\)s in virtue of their common\n\\(F\\)-ness. When a girl learns that her cat has a nictitating\nmembrane that protects its eyes, she rightly expects that her\nneighbor\u2019s cat also has a nictitating membrane. Generality saves\nlabor. When the girl says that she wants a toy rather than clothes,\nshe narrows the range of acceptable gifts without going through the\ntrouble of specifying a particular gift. The girl also balances\nvalues: a gift should be intrinsically desired and yet also be a\nsurprise. If uncertain about which channel is the weather channel, she\ncan hedge by describing the channel as \u2018forty-something\u2019.\nThere is an inverse relationship between the contentfulness of a\nproposition and its probability: the more specific a claim, the less\nlikely it is to be true. By gauging generality, we can make sensible\ntrade-offs between truth and detail.\n\n\u2018Vague\u2019 has a sense that is synonymous with abnormal\ngenerality. This precipitates many equivocal explanations of\nvagueness. For instance, many commentators say that vagueness exists\nbecause broad categories ease the task of classification. If I can\ndescribe your sweater as red, then I do not need to ascertain whether\nit is scarlet. This freedom to use wide intervals obviously helps us\nto learn, teach, communicate, and remember. But so what? The problem\nis to explain the existence of borderline cases. Are they present\nbecause vagueness serves a function? Or are borderline cases\nside-effects of ordinary conversation\u2014like the echoes indoor\nlisteners learn to ignore?\n\nEvery natural language is both vague and ambiguous. However, both\nfeatures seem eliminable. Indeed, both are eliminated in miniature\nlanguages such as checkers notation, computer programming languages,\nand mathematical descriptions. Moreover, it seems that both vagueness\nand ambiguity ought to be minimized. \u2018Vague\u2019 and\n\u2018ambiguous\u2019 are pejorative terms. And they deserve their\nbad reputations. Think of all the automotive misery that has been\nprefaced by\n\nDriver: Do I turn left?\n\nPassenger: Right.\n\n\nEnglish can be lethal. Philosophers have long motivated appeals for an\nideal language by pointing out how ambiguity creates the menace of\nequivocation:\n\nNo child should work.\n\nEvery person is a child of someone.\n\nTherefore, no one should work.\n\n\nHappily, we know how to criticize and correct all equivocations.\nIndeed, every natural language is self-disambiguating in the sense\nthat each has all the resources needed to uniquely specify any reading\none desires.\n3. The Philosophical Challenge Posed by Vagueness\n\nVagueness, in contrast, precipitates a profound problem: the sorites\nparadox. For instance,\n\nBase step: A one-day-old human being is a child.\nInduction step: If an \\(n\\)-day-old human being is a child, then\nthat human being is also a child when it is \\(n + 1\\) days old.\nConclusion: Therefore, a 36,500-day-old human being is a\nchild.\n\n\nThe conclusion is false because a 100-year-old man is clearly a\nnon-child. Since the base step of the argument is also plainly true\nand the argument is valid by mathematical induction, we seem to have\nno choice but to reject the second premise.\n\nGeorge Boolos (1991) observes that we have an autonomous case against\nthe induction step. In addition to implying plausible conditionals\nsuch as \u201cIf a 1-day-old human being is a child, then that human\nbeing is also a child when it is 2 days old\u201d, the induction step\nalso implies ludicrous conditionals such as \u201cIf a 1-day-old\nhuman being is a child, then that human being is also a child when\n36,500 days old\u201d.\n\nBoolos is puzzled why we overlook these clear counterexamples. One\nexplanation is that we tend to treat the induction step as a\ngeneric generalization such as \u201cPeople have ten\ntoes\u201d (Sorensen 2012) rather than a generalization with a\nquantifier such as \u2018all\u2019 or \u2018most\u2019. Whereas\nthe universal generalization \u201cAll people have ten toes\u201d is\nrefuted by a single person with eleven toes, the generic\ngeneralization tolerates exceptions.\n\nThis hypothesis is plausible for newcomers to the sorites paradox. But\nit is less plausible for those being tutored by Professor Boolos. He\nguides logic students to the correct, universal reading of the\ninduction step. When students drift to a generic reading, Boolos\nreminds them that the induction step is a generalization that\ntolerates no exceptions.\n\nGuided by Boolos\u2019 firm hand, logic students drive a\nsecond stake into the heart of the induction step (the\nentailment of preposterous conditionals). Yet the paradox seems far\nfrom dead. The hitch is that death for the induction step is life for\nits negation. The negation of the second premise classically implies a\nsharp threshold for childhood. For the falsehood of the induction step\nimplies the existential generalization that there is a number \\(n\\)\nsuch that an \\(n\\)-day-old human being is a child but is no longer a\nchild one day later.\n\nEpistemicists accept this astonishing consequence. They stand by\nclassical logic and conclude that vagueness is a form of ignorance.\nFor any day in the borderline region of \u2018child\u2019, there is\na small probability that it is the day one stopped being a child.\nNormally, the probability is negligible. But if we round down to zero,\nwe fall into into inconsistency.\n\nThis diagnosis is reminiscent of Carl Hempel\u2019s solution to the\nRaven Paradox. At first blush, we deny that a white handkerchief could\nconfer any degree of confirmation on \u2018All ravens are\nblack\u2019. But this is incompatible with us regarding a white\nhandkerchief as providing some confirmation of \u2018All non-black\nthings are non-ravens\u2019. Since this contrapositive is logically\nequivalent to \u2018All ravens are black\u2019, whatever confirms\none hypothesis confirms the other. Hempel advises us to regain\nconsistency by conceding that a white handkerchief slightly confirms\n\u2018All ravens are black\u2019. Similarly, Hempel might advise us\nto slightly raise the probability of a borderline child being a child\nupon learning that she is a day younger than previously believed.\n\nHempel\u2019s only reservation about indoor ornithology is\ninefficiency. Given how the actual world is arranged, more news about\n\u2018All ravens are black\u2019 can be gained outdoors. We do not\nbother to look indoors because the return on inquiry is too low.\nBottom-up Bayesians envisage extraordinary scenarios in which the\nreturn on inquiry could be high. However, even their ample imagination\nfails to yield a possible world in which a single day has a more\ndiscernible opportunity to make a difference to whether someone is a\nchild. All pressure to shift credence is exerted top down from\nprobability theory.\n\nTimothy Williamson (1994) traces our ignorance of the threshold for\nchildhood to \u201cmargin for error\u201d principles. If one knows\nthat an \\(n\\)-day-old human being is a child, then that human being\nmust also be a child when \\(n + 1\\) days old. Otherwise, one is right\nby luck. Given that there is a threshold, we would be ignorant of its\nlocation. Under a use theory of meaning, the threshold depends on many\nspeakers. Williamson characterizes this threshold as sharing the\nunpredictability of long-term weather forecasts. According to the\nmeteorologist Edward Lorenz, a tornado in Kansas could be precipitated\nby the flapping of a butterfly\u2019s wings in Tokyo.\n\nThe use theory of meaning does not apply to asocial languages. For\ninstance, psycholinguists postulate a language of thought that is not\nused for communication. This innate language is vague.\n\nNatural languages lexicalize only a small share of our concepts. The\nprimary bearers of vagueness are concepts rather than words (Bacon\n2018). Aphasia does not end vague thinking. Insofar as we attribute\nthinking to non-linguistic animals, we attribute vague thinking.\nPeirce\u2019s emphasis on a community of inquirers encourages a\nsociology of language. Ludwig Wittgenstein\u2019s attack on the\npossibility of a private language was intended to remove any rival to\na community-based approach to language. Yet asocial vagueness remains\nviable. This motivates some epistemicists to explain our ignorance\nmore metaphysically, say, as an effect of there being no truth-maker\nto control the truth-value of a borderline statement (Sorensen 2001,\nchapter 11).\n\nDebate over Williamson\u2019s margin for error principle draws us\ndeep into epistemology and modality (Yli-Vakkuri 2016). Preferring to\nexplore the shallows, some commentators survey attitudes weaker than\nknowledge. According to Nicholas Smith (2008, 182) we cannot even\nguess that the threshold for baldness is the 400th hair. Hartry Field\n(2010, 203) denies that a rational man can fear that he has just\npassed the threshold into being old. Hope, speculation, and wonder do\nnot require evidence but they do require understanding. So it is\nrevealing that these attitudes have trouble getting a purchase on the\nthreshold of oldness (or any other vague predicate). A simple\nexplanation is that bare linguistic competence gives us knowledge that\nthere are no such thresholds. This accounts for the comical air of the\nepistemicist. Just as there is no conceptual room to worry that there\nis a natural number between sixty and sixty one, there is no\nconceptual room to worry that one has passed the threshold of oldness\nbetween one\u2019s sixtieth and sixty-first birthday.\n\nAn old epistemicist might reply: My piecemeal confidence that a given\nnumber is not the threshold for oldness does not agglomerate into\ncollective confidence that there is no such number. If I wager against\neach number being the threshold, then I must have placed a losing bet\nsomewhere. For if I won each bet then there was no opportunity for me\nto make the transition to oldness. My bookie could have made a\n\u201cDutch book\u201d against me. He would have been entitled to\npayment without having to identify which bet I lost. Since\nprobabilities may be extracted from hypothetical betting behavior, I\nmust actually assign some small (normally negligible) probability to\nhypotheses identifying particular thresholds. So must you.\n\nStephen Schiffer (2003, 204) denies that classical probability\ncalculations apply in vague contexts. Suppose Donald is borderline old\nand borderline bald. According to Schiffer we should be just as\nconfident in the conjunction \u2018Donald is old and bald\u2019 as\nin either conjunct. Adding conjuncts does not reduce confidence\nbecause we have a \u201cvague partial belief\u201d rather than the\nstandard belief assumed by mathematicians developing probability\ntheory. Schiffer offers a calculus for this vagueness-related\npropositional attitude. He crafts the rules for vague partial belief\nto provide a psychological solution to the sorites\nparadox.\n\nThe project is complicated by the fact that vague partial beliefs\ninteract with precise beliefs (MacFarlane 2010). Consider a statement\nthat has a mixture of vague and precise conjuncts: \u2018Donald is\nold and bald and has an even number of hairs\u2019. Adding the extra\nprecise conjunct should diminish confidence. Schiffer also needs to\naccommodate the fact that some speakers are undecided about whether\nthe nature of the uncertainty involves vagueness. Even an idealized\nspeaker may be unsure because there is vagueness about the borders\nbetween vagueness-related uncertainty and other sorts of\nuncertainty.\n\nAttitudes toward determinacy vary over time. Bernard Williams (2010,\n162) says Thucydides (460\u2013400 BC) invented historical time.\nThucydides insists that any two events occurred simultaneously or one\noccurred before the other. Thucydides does not countenance a vague\n\u201colden days\u201d\u2014a period in which events fail to be\nchronologically ordered. Every event is situated on a single timeline.\nThere can be ignorance of when an event took place but there is always\na fact of the matter. With similar focus, Archimedes (287\u2013212\nBC) insists that every quantity corresponds to a specific number. No\nquantity, however large, is innumerable. In \u201cThe Sand\nReckoner\u201d Archimedes devises a special notation to express the\ntotal number of grains of sand. The reductionism of Enlightenment\nthinkers led them to further analysis of shades of gray into black and\nwhite dots of precision.\n\nIn a holistic reaction, the Romantics portray the new boundaries as no\nmore real than the grid lines of a microscope. The specimen under the\nslide lacks boundaries. Understanding does not require boundaries.\nOrganizing items along a spectrum is a natural form of classification.\nWe comprehend this analog grouping more readily and smoothly than we\ngrasp the digital groupings instilled by Descartes\u2019 algebraic\nrepresentation of space. If our metaphysics of classification is\nconstricted by a logic designed for mathematics, the sorites paradox\nwill make us see disorder where there is really order of a more fluid\nsort. Spontaneous arrangements will bring what order is permitted by\nthe subject matter. Romantic biologists take to the field and refuse\nto pen species within the axes of the Cartesian coordinate system.\nConfronted with novel phenomena such as evolution, magnetism and\nelectricity, Romantic scientists bypassed boundaries.\n\nA geologist views a pair of aerial photographs cross-eyed. His brain\nrecognizes the two images as representations of the same landscape.\nThe flat images fuse into a unifying stereoscopic perspective. The\nRomantics portray vague language as perceptively de-focussed.\nVagueness is not the cloudy vision of an old man with cataracts.\n\nThe epistemicist fits into the Thucydidean tradition of replacing\nindeterminacy with determinacy. Crispin Wright (2021, 393) compares\nthe epistemicist\u2019s postulation of hidden boundaries to the\nmathematical realist\u2019s postulation of a hidden Platonic realm.\nBoth the epistemicist and the mathematical realist add metaphysical\ninfrastructure to ensure truth will transcend our means of proof. This\ninfrastructure validates proofs of generalizations that are not\nconstructed from examples. The impossibility of finding a witness for\nan existential generalization, such as \u2018There is a youngest old\nman\u2019, is compatible with there being a non-constructive\nproof.\n\nDespite rearguard defenses by the Romantics, Newtonian physics\nappeared to show that empirical reality fits classical logic. The hard\nsciences illustrated the crystalline growth of determinacy. But in a\nshocking reversal, quantum mechanics suggests the possibility of\nreversing from determinacy to indeterminacy. What had been formerly\nregarded as determinate, the position and velocity of an object, was\nregarded as indeterminate by Werner Heisenberg. Quantum logicians,\nsuch as Hilary Putnam (1976), abandoned the distributive laws of\npropositional logic.\n\nPutnam (1983) went on propose a solution that seems to apply L. E. J.\nBrouwer\u2019s intuitionism to the sorites paradox. (In response to a\nrebuttal, Putnam [1985] surprisingly denied that intuitionistic\nsemantics was part of the proposal.) Brouwer had achieved fame with\nhis fixed point theorem. But reflection on Kant\u2019s philosophy of\nmathematics led Brouwer to retract his lovely proof. Any\nnon-constructive proof had to be replaced! Brouwer\u2019s recall of\nestablished theorems yielded more specific proofs that had higher\nexplanatory power. Theorems that could not be retrofitted became\nobjects of agnosticism. This was sad news for Brouwer\u2019s fixed\npoint theorem. But Putnam welcomes the recall of the\nepistemicist\u2019s theorem that there is a smallest natural number.\nThe classical logician relies on double negation to deduce a hidden\nboundary from the negation of the generalization \u201cIf \\(n\\) is\nsmall, then \\(n + 1\\) is small\u201d. Since the intuitionist does not\naccept this classical rule, his refusal to acquiesce to the induction\nstep does not saddle him with hidden thresholds. Like the\nepistemicist, the intuitionist treats vagueness as a cognitive problem\nthat does not require rejecting the law of bivalence. Unlike the\nepistemicist, the intuitionist must not claim to know the law of\nbivalence. To sustain this agnosticism about bivalence, the\nintuitionist must parry the sorites monger\u2019s reformulations\n(Wright 2021, chapter 14). For instance, the intuitionist\u2019s\nleast number principle threatens to re-ignite the sorites.\n\nMany commentators concede to the epistemicist that it is logically\npossible for vague predicates to have thresholds. They just think it\nwould be a miracle:\n\nIt is logically possible that the words on this page will come to life\nand sort my socks. But I know enough about words to dismiss this as a\nserious possibility. So I am right to boggle at the possibility that\nour rough and ready terms such as \u2018red\u2019 could so\nsensitively classify objects.\n\n\nEpistemicists counter that this bafflement rests on an over-estimate\nof stipulation\u2019s role in meaning. Epistemicists say much meaning\nis acquired passively by default rather than actively by decision. If\nsome boundaries are more eligible for reference than others, then the\nenvironment does the work. If nothing steps in to make a proposition\ntrue, then it is false. Or so opines Timothy Williamson.\n\nMost doubt whether precise analytical tools fit vague arguments. The\nscientific Romantic H. G. Wells was amongst the first to suggest that\nwe must moderate the application of logic:\n\nEvery species is vague, every term goes cloudy at its edges, and so in\nmy way of thinking, relentless logic is only another name for\nstupidity\u2014for a sort of intellectual pigheadedness. If you push\na philosophical or metaphysical enquiry through a series of valid\nsyllogisms\u2014never committing any generally recognised\nfallacy\u2014you nevertheless leave behind you at each step a certain\nrubbing and marginal loss of objective truth and you get deflections\nthat are difficult to trace at each phase in the process. Every\nspecies waggles about in its definition, every tool is a little loose\nin its handle, every scale has its individual error. (1908, 18)\n\n\nMany more believe that the problem is with logic itself rather than\nthe manner in which it is applied. They favor solving the sorites\nparadox by replacing standard logic with an earthier deviant\nlogic.\n\nThere is a desperately wide range of opinions as to how the revision\nof logic should be executed. Every form of deviant logic has been\napplied in the hope of resolving the sorites paradox.\n4. Many-valued Logic\n\nAn early favorite was many-valued logic. On this approach, borderline\nstatements are assigned truth-values that lie between full truth and\nfull falsehood. Some logicians favor three truth-values, others prefer\nfour or five. The most popular approach is to use an infinite number\nof truth-values represented by the real numbers between 0 (for full\nfalsehood) and 1 (for full truth). This infinite spectrum of\ntruth-values might be of service for a continuous sorites argument\ninvolving \u2018small real number\u2019 (Weber and Colyvan 2010).\nClassical logic does not enforce a sharp boundary for infinite\ndomains. But it still enforces unlimited sensitivity for vague\npredicates. If two quantities \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are growing but \\(A\\) is\ngiven a headstart, then \\(A\\) will cease to equal a small real number\nbefore \\(B\\). Since this transitional difference holds regardless of\nthe lead\u2019s magnitude, \u201c\\(A\\) equals a small real\nnumber\u201d passes from true to false within an arbitrarily narrow\ninterval. If the number of truth-values is instead as numerous as the\nreal numbers, there is no longer any mismatch between the tiny size of\nthe transition and the large difference in truth-value.\n\nThere is a new mismatch, however. The number of truth-values now\ndwarfs the number of truth-value bearers. Since a natural language can\nexpress any proposition, the number of propositions equals the number\nof sentences. The number of sentences is \\(\\aleph_0\\) while (assuming\nthe continuum hypothesis) the number of real numbers is at least\n\\(\\aleph_1\\). Consequently, there are infinitely many truth-values\nwithout bearers.\n\nThis new mismatch seems more bearable than the old mismatch it is\ndesigned to avoid. Yet some find even a lower infinity of truth-values\nover-bearing. Instead of having just one artificially sharp line\nbetween the true and the false, the many-valued logician has\ninfinitely many sharp lines such as that between statements with a\ntruth of .323483925 and those with a higher truth-value. Mark\nSainsbury grimaces, \u2018\u2026 you do not improve a bad idea by\niterating it\u2019 (1996, 255).\n\nA proponent of an infinite-valued logic might cheer up Sainsbury with\nan analogy. It is a bad idea to model a circle with a straight line.\nUsing two lines is not much better, nor is there is much improvement\nusing a three-sided polygon (a triangle). But as we add more straight\nlines to the polygon (square, pentagon, hexagon, and so on) we make\nprogress\u2014by iterating the bad idea of modeling a circle with\nstraight lines.\n\nIndeed, it would be tempting to triumphantly conclude \u201cThe\ncircle has been modeled as an infinite-sided polygon\u201d. But has\nthe circle been revealed to be an infinite-sided polygon? Have curved\nlines been replaced by straight lines? Have curved lines (and hence\ncircles) been proven to not exist? A model can succeed without being\nclear what has been achieved.\n\nBut it is premature to dwell on the analogy \u201cPrecision is to\nvagueness as straightness is to curvature\u201d. The many-valued\nlogician must first vindicate the comparison by providing details\nabout how to calculate the truth-values of vague statements from the\ntruth-values of their component statements.\n\nProponents of many-valued logic approach this obligation with great\nindustry. Precise new rules are introduced to calculate the\ntruth-values of compound statements that contain statements with\nintermediate truth-values. For instance, the revised rule for\nconjunctions assigns the conjunction the same truth-value as the\nconjunct with the lowest truth-value. These rules are designed to\nyield all standard theorems when all the truth-values are 1 and 0. In\nthis sense, classical logic is a limiting case of many-valued logic.\nClassical logic is agreed to work fine in the area for which it was\ndesigned\u2014mathematics.\n\nMost theorems of standard logic break down when intermediate\ntruth-values are involved. (An irregular minority, such as \u2018If\n\\(P\\), then \\(P\\)\u2019, survive.) Even the classical contradiction\n\u2018Donald is bald and it is not the case that he is bald\u2019\nreceives a truth-value of .5 when \u2018Donald is bald\u2019 has a\ntruth-value of .5. Many-valued logicians note that the error they are\nimputing to classical logic is often so small that classical logic can\nstill be fruitfully applied. But they insist that the sorites paradox\nillustrates how tiny errors accumulate into a big error.\n\nCritics of the many-valued approach complain that it botches phenomena\nsuch as hedging. If I regard you as a borderline case of \u2018tall\nman\u2019, I cannot sincerely assert that you are tall and I cannot\nsincerely assert that you are of average height. But I can assert the\nhedged claim \u2018Either you are tall or of average height\u2019.\nThe many-valued rule for disjunction is to assign the whole statement\nthe truth-value of its highest disjunct. Normally, the added disjunct\nin a hedged claim is not more plausible than the other disjuncts. Thus\nit cannot increase the degree of truth. Disappointingly, the proponent\nof many-valued logic cannot trace the increase of assertibility to an\nincrease in the degree of truth.\n\nEpistemicists ascribe the increase in assertibility to the increasing\nprobability of truth. Since the addition of disjuncts can raise\nprobability indefinitely, the epistemicists correctly predict that we\ncan hedge our way to full assertibility. However, epistemicists do not\nhave a monopoly on this prediction.\n5. Supervaluationism\n\nAccording to supervaluationists, borderline statements lack a\ntruth-value. This neatly explains why it is universally impossible to\nknow the truth-value of a borderline statement. Supervaluationists\noffer details about the nature of absolute borderline cases. Simple\nsentences about borderline cases lack a truth-value. Compounds of\nthese statements can have a truth-value if they come out true\nregardless of how the statement is admissibly precisified. For\ninstance, \u2018Either Mr. Stoop is tall or it is not the case that\nMr. Stoop is tall\u2019 is true because it comes out true under all\nways of sharpening \u2018tall\u2019. Thus the method of\nsupervaluations allows one to retain all the theorems of standard\nlogic while admitting \u201ctruth-value gaps\u201d.\n\nOne may wonder whether this striking result is a genuine convergence\nwith standard logic. Is the supervaluationist characterizing vague\nstatements as propositions? Or is he merely pointing out that certain\nnon-propositions have a structure isomorphic to logical theorems?\n(Some electrical circuits are isomorphic to tautologies but this does\nnot make the circuits tautologies.) Kit Fine (1975, 282), and\nespecially David Lewis (1982), characterize vagueness as\nhyper-ambiguity. Instead of there being one vague concept, there are\nmany precise concepts that closely resemble each other.\n\u2018Child\u2019 can mean a human being at most one day old or mean\na human being at most two days old or mean a human being at most three\ndays old \u2026. Thus the logic of vagueness is a logic for\nequivocators. Lewis\u2019 idea is that ambiguous statements are true\nwhen they come out true under all disambiguations. But logicians\nnormally require that a statement be disambiguated before\nlogic is applied. The mere fact that an ambiguous statement comes out\ntrue under all its disambiguations does not show that the statement\nitself is true. Sentences which are actually disambiguated\nmay have truth-values. But the best that can be said of those that\nmerely could be disambiguated is that they would\nhave had a truth-value had they been disambiguated (Tye 1989).\n\nSupervaluationism will converge with classical logic only if each word\nof the supervaluated sentence is uniformly interpreted. For instance,\n\u2018Either a carbon copy of Teddy Roosevelt\u2019s signature is an\nautograph or it is not the case that a carbon copy of Teddy\nRoosevelt\u2019s signature is an autograph\u2019 comes out true only\nif \u2018autograph\u2019 is interpreted the same way in both\ndisjuncts. Vague sentences resist mixed interpretations. However,\nmixed interpretations are permissible for ambiguous sentences. As\nLewis himself notes in a criticism of relevance logic, \u2018Scrooge\nwalked along the bank on his way to the bank\u2019 can receive a\nmixed disambiguation. When exterminators offer \u2018non-toxic ant\npoison\u2019, we charitably switch relativizations within the noun\nphrase: the substance is safe for human beings but deadly for\nants.\n\nEven if one agrees that supervaluationism converges with classical\nlogic about theoremhood, they clearly differ in other respects.\nSupervaluationism requires rejection of inference rules such as\ncontraposition, conditional proof and reductio ad absurdum\n(Williamson 1994, 151\u2013152). In the eyes of the\nsupervaluationist, a demonstration that a statement is not true does\nnot guarantee that the statement is false.\n\nThe supervaluationist is also under pressure to reject semantic\nprinciples which are intimately associated with the application of\nlogical laws. According to Alfred Tarski\u2019s Convention T, a\nstatement \u2018\\(S\\)\u2019 is true if and only if \\(S\\). In other\nwords, truth is disquotational. Supervaluationists say that being\nsupertrue (being true under all precisifications) suffices for being\ntrue. But given Convention T, supertruth would then be disquotational.\nSince the supervaluationists accept the principle of excluded middle,\nthe combination of Convention T and \u2018P or ~P\u2019 being\nsupertrue would force them to say \u2018\\(P\\)\u2019 is supertrue or\n\u2018\\(\\neg P\\)\u2019 is supertrue (even if \u2018\\(P\\)\u2019\napplies a predicate to a borderline case). This would imply that\neither \u2018\\(P\\)\u2019 is true or \u2018\\(\\neg P\\)\u2019 is true\n(Williamson 1994, 162\u2013163). And that would be a fatal loss of\ntruth-value gaps for supervaluationism.\n\nThere is a final concern about the \u201contological honesty\u201d\nof the supervaluationist\u2019s existential quantifier. As part of\nhis solution to the sorites paradox, the supervaluationist asserts,\n\u201cThere is a human being who, for some \\(n\\), was a child when\n\\(n\\) days old but not when \\(n + 1\\) days old.\u201d For this\nstatement comes out true under all admissible precisifications of\n\u2018child\u2019. However, when pressed the supervaluationist adds\na codicil: \u201cOh, of course I do not mean that there really is a\nsharp threshold for childhood.\u201d\n\nAfter the clarification, some wonder how supervaluationists differs\nfrom drastic metaphysical skeptics. In his nihilist days, Peter Unger\n(1979) admitted that it is useful to talk as if there are\nchildren. But he insisted that strictly speaking, vague terms such as\n\u2018child\u2019 cannot apply to anything. Unger was free to use\nsupervaluationism as a theory to explain our ordinary discourse about\nchildren. (Unger instead used other resources to explain how we\nfruitfully apply empty predicates.) But once the dust had cleared and\nthe precise rubble came into focus, Unger had to conclude that there\nare no children.\n\nOfficially, the supervaluationist rejects the induction step of the\nsorites argument. Unofficially, he seems to instead reject the\nbase step of the sorites argument.\n\nSupervaluationists encourage the view that all vagueness is a matter\nof linguistic indecision: the reason why there are borderline cases is\nthat we have not bothered to make up our minds. The method of\nsupervaluation allows us to assign truth-values prior to any\ndecisions. Expressivists think this is a mistake akin to assigning\ntruth-values to normative claims (MacFarlane 2016). They model\nvagueness as practical uncertainty as to whether to treat a borderline\n\\(F\\) as an \\(F\\). The deliberator may accept the tautologies of\nclassical logic as constraints governing competing plans for drawing\nlines. I can accept \u201cEither Donald is bald or not\u201d without\naccepting either disjunct. An existentially quantified sentence can be\naccepted even when no instance is. A shrug of the shoulders signals\nreadiness to go either way, not ignorance as to which possible world\none inhabits.\n\nThe expressivist is poised to explain how supervaluationism developed\ninto the most respected theory of vagueness. Frege portrayed vagueness\nas negligent under-definition: One haphazardly introduces a necessary\ncondition here, a sufficient condition there, but fails to supply a\ncondition that is both necessary and sufficient. Supervaluationists\ncounter that indecision can be both intentional and functional.\nInstead of committing ourselves prematurely, we fill in meanings as we\ngo along in light of new information and interests.\n\nPsychologists may deny that we could really commit ourselves to the\ncomplete precisifications envisaged by the supervaluationist (which\nencompass an entire language). Many of these comprehensive\nalternatives are too complex for memory. For instance, any\nprecisification admitting a long band of random verdicts will be\nalgorithmically complex and so not compressible in a rule. Realistic\nalternatives are only modestly more precise than ordinary usage.\n\nNevertheless, the supervaluationist\u2019s conjecture about gradual\nprecisification is popular for the highly stipulative enterprise of\npromulgating and enforcing laws (Endicott 2000). Judges frequently\nseem to exercise and control discretion by means of vague language.\nUncertainties about the scope of discretion may arise from\nhigher-order vagueness (Schauer 2016).\n\nDiscretion through gap-filling pleases those who regard adjudication\nas a creative process. It alarms those who think we should be judged\nby laws rather than men. The doctrine of discretion through\nindeterminacy has also been questioned on the grounds that the source\nof the discretion is the generality of the legal terms rather than\ntheir vagueness (Poscher 2012).\n\nBy David Lanius\u2019s (2019) reckoning, the only function for\nvagueness in law is strategic. Drunk driving is discouraged by the\nvagueness of \u2018drunk\u2019 in the way it is discouraged by\nrandom testing of motorists. Scattershot enforcement becomes a welcome\nfeature of the legal system rather than a bug in the legal\nprogramming. Motorists stay sober to avoid participation in a\npunishment lottery.\n\nJudicial variance is just what one expects if the judges are making a\nforced choice on borderline cases. Judges cannot confess ignorance and\nso are compelled to assert beyond their evidence. Little wonder that\nwhat comes out of their mouth is affected by irrelevancies such as\nwhat went in their mouths for lunch. This susceptibility to bias by\nirrelevant factors (weather, order effects, anchoring) could be\neliminated by methodical use of a lottery. The lottery could be\nweighted to the fact that borderline crimes vary in how close they\ncome to being clear crimes.\n\nHrahn Asgeirsson (2020, chapter 3) admits that the descriptive\nquestion \u2018Is this drunk driving?\u2019 cannot be more reliably\nanswered by a judge than anyone else when it is a borderline case. But\nhe thinks the normative question, \u2018Should this be counted as\ndrunk driving?\u2019 could be better answered by those with superior\nknowledge of legislative intent.\n6. Subvaluationism\n\nWhereas the supervaluationist analyzes borderline cases in terms of\ntruth-value gaps the dialetheist analyzes them in terms of truth-value\ngluts. A glut is a proposition that is both true and false. The rule\nfor assigning gluts is the mirror image of the rule for assigning\ngaps: A statement is true exactly if it comes out true on at least one\nprecisification. The statement is false just if it comes out false on\nat least one precisification. So if the statement comes out true under\none precisification and false under another precisification, the\nstatement is both true and false.\n\nTo avoid triviality, the dialetheist must adopt a paraconsistent logic\nthat stops two contradictory statements from jointly implying\neverything. The resulting \u201csubvaluationism\u201d is a dual of\nsupervaluationism.\n\nThe spiritual father of subvaluationism is Georg Hegel. For Hegel, the\nbasic kind of vagueness is conflict vagueness. The shopper in between\nthe wings of a revolving doorway is both inside the building and\noutside the building. Degree vagueness is just a special case of the\nconflict inherent in becoming. Any process requires a gradual\nmanifestation of a contradiction inherent in the original state. At\nsome stage, a metamorphosizing caterpillar is not a butterfly (by\nvirtue of what it was) and a butterfly (by virtue of what it will be).\nHegelians believed this dialectical conception of vagueness solved the\nsorites and demonstrated the inadequacy of classical logic (Weber\n2010). The Russian Marxist Georgi Plekhanov (1908 [1937]) proposed a\nlogic of contradiction to succeed classical logic (Hyde 2008,\n93\u20135). One of his students, Henry Mehlberg (1958) went on to\nsubstitute gaps for gluts. The first version of supervaluationism is\nthus a synthesis, reconciling the thesis of classical logic with the\nanti-thesis posed by the logic of contradiction.\n\nFrom a formal point of view, there seems no more reason to prefer one\ndeparture from classical logic rather than the other (Cobreros and\nTranchini 2019). Since Western philosophers abominate contradiction,\nparity with dialetheism would diminish the great popularity of\nsupervaluationism.\n\nA Machiavellian epistemicist will welcome this battle between the gaps\nand the gluts. He roots for the weaker side. Although he does not want\nthe subvaluationist to win, the Machiavellian epistemicist does want\nthe subvaluationist to achieve mutual annihilation with his\nsupervaluationist doppelg\u00e4nger. His political calculation is:\nGaps + Gluts = Bivalence.\n\nPablo Cobreros (2011) has argued that subvaluationism provides a\nbetter treatment of higher-order vagueness than supervaluationism. But\nfor the most part, the subvaluationists (and their frenemies) have\nmerely claimed subvaluationism to be at least as attractive as\nsupervaluationism (Hyde and Colyvan 2008). This modest ambition seems\nprudent. After all, truth-value gaps have far more independent support\nfrom the history of philosophy (at least Western philosophy). Prior to\nthe explosive growth of vagueness research after 1975, ordinary\nlanguage philosophers amassed a panoramic battery of analyses\nsuggesting that gaps are involved in presupposition, reference\nfailure, fiction, future contingent propositions, performatives, and\nso on and so on. Supervaluationism rigorously consolidated these\nappeals to ordinary language.\n\nDialetheists characterize intolerance for contradiction as a shallow\nphenomenon, restricted to a twentieth-century Western academic milieu\n(maybe even now being eclipsed by the rise of China). Experimental\nphilosophers have challenged the old appeals to ordinary language with\nempirical results suggesting that glutty talk is as readily stimulated\nby borderline cases as gappy talk (Alxatib and Pelletier 2011, Ripley\n2011).\n7. Contextualism\n\nJust as contextualism in epistemology runs orthogonal to the familiar\ndivisions amongst epistemologists (foundationalism, reliabilism,\ncoherentism, etc.), there are contextualists of every persuasion\namongst vagueness theorists. They develop an analogy between the\nsorites paradox and indexical sophistries such as:\n\nBase step: The horizon is more than 1 meter away.\nInduction step: If the horizon is more than \\(n\\) meters away,\nthen it is more than \\(n + 1\\) meters away.\nConclusion: The horizon is more than a billion meters away.\n\n\nThe horizon is where the earth meets the sky and is certainly less\nthan a billion meters away. (The circumference of the earth is only\nforty million meters.) Yet when you travel toward the horizon to\nspecify the \\(n\\) at which the induction step fails, your trip is as\nfutile as the pursuit of the rainbow. You cannot reach the horizon\nbecause it shifts with your location.\n\nAll contextualists accuse the sorites monger of equivocating. In one\nsense, the meaning of \u2018child\u2019 is uniform; the\ncontext-invariant rule for using the term (its\n\u201ccharacter\u201d) is constant. However, the set of things to\nwhich the term applies (its \u201ccontent\u201d) shifts with the\ncontext. In this respect, vague words resemble indexical terms such\nas: \u2018I\u2019, \u2018you\u2019, \u2018here\u2019,\n\u2018now\u2019, \u2018today\u2019, \u2018tomorrow\u2019. When a\ndebtor tells his creditor on Monday \u2018I will pay you back\ntomorrow\u2019 and then repeats the sentence on Tuesday, there is a\nsense in which he has said the same thing (the character is the same)\nand a sense in which he has said something different (the content has\nshifted because \u2018tomorrow\u2019 now picks out Wednesday).\n\nAccording to the contextualists, the rules governing the shifts\nprohibit us from interpreting any instance of the induction step as\nhaving a true antecedent and a false consequent. The very process of\ntrying to refute the induction step changes the context so that the\ninstance will not come out false. Indeed, contextualists typically\nemphasize that each instance is true. Assent is mandatory.\nConsequently, direct attacks on the induction step must fail. One is\nput in mind of Seneca\u2019s admonition to his student Nero:\n\u201cHowever many you put to death, you will never kill your\nsuccessor.\u201d\n\nHans Kamp (1981), the founder of contextualism, maintained that the\nextension of vague words orbits the speaker\u2019s store of\nconversational commitments. He notes that the commitment pressures the\nspeaker to adjust past judgments to current judgments. This backward\nsmoothing undermines the search for a sharp transition. The diagnostic\npotential of this smoothing is first recognized by Diana Raffman\n(1994). Switching categories (e.g., from blue to green) between two\nneighboring, highly similar items in a sorites series, without\ninstalling a boundary, is enabled by a gestalt switch that occurs\nbetween the two judgments. Switching categories comes at a cost,\nhowever; so once the classifier has switched to a new category, she\nwill stay in the new category as long as she can. In particular, if\nshe now reverses direction and goes back down the series, she will\ncontinue to classify as green some items she previously classified as\nblue. This pattern of judgments, hysteresis, has the effect of\nsmoothing out the category shift so that the seeming continuity of the\nseries is preserved. Instead of merely inviting psychologists to\nverify her predictions about hysteresis effects in sorites series,\nRaffman (2014, 146\u2013156) collaborates with two psychologists to\nrun an experiment that confirms them.\n\nStewart Shapiro integrates Kamp\u2019s ideas with Friedrich\nWaismann\u2019s concept of open texture. Shapiro thinks speakers have\ndiscretion over borderline cases because they are judgment dependent.\nThey come out true in virtue of the speaker judging them to be true.\nGiven that the audience does not resist, borderline cases of\n\u2018child\u2019 can be correctly described as children. The\naudience recognizes that other competent speakers could describe the\nborderline case differently. As Waismann lyricizes, \u201cEvery\ndescription stretches, as it were, into a horizon of open\npossibilities: However far I go, I shall always carry this horizon\nwith me\u201d (1945, 124).\n\nAmerican pragmaticism colors Delia Graff Fara\u2019s contextualism.\nConsider dandelion farms. Why would someone grow weeds? The answer is\nthat \u2018weed\u2019 is relative to interests. Dandelions are\nunwanted by lawn caretakers but are desired by farmers for food and\nwine. Fara thinks this interest relativity extends to all vague words.\nFor instance, \u2018child\u2019 means a degree of immaturity that is\nsignificant to the speaker. Since the interests of the speaker shift,\nthere is an opportunity for a shift in the extension of\n\u2018child\u2019. Fara is reluctant to describe herself as a\ncontextualist because the context only has an indirect effect on the\nextension via the changes it makes to the speaker\u2019s\ninterest.\n\nHow strictly are we to take the comparison between vague words and\nindexical terms? Scott Soames (2002, 445) answers that all vague words\nliterally are indexical.\n\nThis straightforward response is open to the objection that the\nsorites monger could stabilize reference. When the sorites monger\nrelativizes \u2018horizon\u2019 to the northeast corner of the\nEmpire State Building\u2019s observation deck, he seems to generate a\ngenuine sorites paradox that exploits the vagueness of\n\u2018horizon\u2019 (not its indexicality).\n\nAll natural languages have stabilizing pronouns, ellipsis, and other\nanaphoric devices. For instance, in \u2018Jack is tired now and Jill\nis too\u2019, the \u2018too\u2019 forces a uniform reading of\n\u2018tired\u2019. Jason Stanley suggests that the sorites monger\nemploy the premise:\n\nIf that1 is a child then that2 is too, and if\nthat2 is too, then that3 is too, and if\nthat3 is too, then that4 is too, \u2026 and\nthen that\\(_i\\) is too.\n\n\nEach \u2018that\\(_n\\)\u2019 refers to the \\(n\\)th element in a\nsequence of worsening examples of \u2018child\u2019. The meaning of\n\u2018child\u2019 is not shifting because the first occurrence of\nthe term governs all the subsequent clauses (thanks to\n\u2018too\u2019). If vague terms were literally indexical, the\nsorites monger would have a strong reply. If vague terms only resemble\nindexicals, then the contextualist needs to develop the analogy in a\nway that circumvents Stanley\u2019s counsel to the sorites\nmonger.\n\nThe contextualist would also need to address a second technique for\nstabilizing the context. R. M. Sainsbury (2013) advises the sorites\nmonger to present his premises in apparently random order. No pair of\nsuccessive cases raises an alarm that similar cases are being treated\ndifferently. Unless the hearer has extraordinary memory, he will not\nfeel pressured to adjust the context.\n\nThe contextualist must find enough shiftiness to block every sorites\nargument. Since vagueness seeps into every syntactic category, critics\ncomplain that contextualism exceeds the level of ambiguity\ncountenanced by linguists and psycholinguists.\n\nAnother concern is that some sorites arguments involve predicates that\ndo not give us an opportunity to equivocate. Consider a sorites with a\nbase step that starts from a number too large for us to think about.\nOr consider an inductive predicate that is too complex for us to\nreason with. One example is obtained by iterating \u2018mother\nof\u2019 a thousand times (Sorensen 2001, 33). This predicate could\nbe embedded in a mind-numbing sorites that would never generate\ncontext shifts.\n\nOther unthinkable sorites arguments use predicates that can only be\ngrasped by individuals in other possible worlds or by creatures with\ndifferent types of minds than ours. More fancifully, there could be a\nvague predicate, such as Saul Kripke\u2019s \u201ckiller\nyellow\u201d, that instantly kills anyone who wields it. The basic\nproblem is that contextualism is a psychologistic theory of the\nsorites. Since arguments can exist without being propounded, they\nfloat free of attempts to moor them to arguers.\n8. Global Indeterminacy without Local Indeterminacy?\n\nContextualists base their holism about vagueness on top-down\npsychology. Holism can also be logical. We encountered this in the\nsupervaluationist\u2019s rejection of truth-functionality. Instead of\ncalculating the truth-values of all compound statements bottom-up from\nthe truth-values of their component statements, Kit Fine (1975)\nassigned truth-values top-down by counting a statement as true if it\ncomes out true under all admissible precisifications of the entire\nlanguage.\n\nFine\u2019s (2020) new holism parachutes in from R. M.\nSainsbury\u2019s (1996) characterization of vagueness in terms of\nboundarylessness. A precise predicate such as\n\u2018thirty-something\u2019 organizes cases into pigeonholes.\nPositive cases commence at thirty and cease at thirty nine. But\nparadigms and foils of \u2018thirty-ish\u2019 operate as poles of a\nmagnet. Candidates for \u2018thirty-ish\u2019 resemble iron filings.\nThis force field prevents completion of a forced-march sorites\nargument (in which we are marched from a definite instance of a\npredicate to a definite non-instance). Judgment must be suspended\nsomewhere in the series. But it does not follow that there is any\nspecific case such that one must suspend judgment about it.\n\nBorderline status has the mobility of a bubble in a level. The\nprecisificationist\u2019s mistake is to remove the bubble.\nPeirce\u2019s mistake is to freeze the bubble into intrinsic\nuncertainty. This is the dual of the error Peirce attributes to\nRen\u00e9 Descartes\u2019 method of universal doubt. Doubting\neverything is impossible because doubt only gets leverage against a\nfulcrum of presuppositions. (Ludwig Wittgenstein\u2019s analogy is\nwith the hinges of a door that hold fast in order that the door of\ndoubt can open and close.) These presuppositions are indubitable in\nthe sense that they cannot be challenged within the inquiry.\nWhen the skeptic claims to doubt everything, he winds up doubting\nnothing. The skeptic\u2019s sham doubts are belied by the absence of\nany interruption of his habits. A genuine doubt triggers inquiry.\nInquiry requires presupposition. These background beliefs must be\ntaken for granted. But the necessary existence of certainty does not\nentail any intrinsic certitudes. What must be presupposed for one\ninquiry need not be presupposed for another. By Fine\u2019s\nreckoning, Peirce should have issued a parallel rejection of intrinsic\nuncertitudes. Within any inquiry, there must be some suspension of\njudgment. But it does not follow that any proposition must resist all\ninquiry.\n\nConsider a literary historiographer who, weary of debate about the\nidentity of the first book, demonstrates that \u2018book\u2019 is\nvague by assembling a slippery slope ranging from early non-books to\nparadigm books. According to Peirce, the demonstration succeeds only\nif the spectrum contains some intrinsically doubtful cases. They are\nwhat makes \u2018book\u2019 vague. Fine\u2019s negative thesis is\nthat this reductionist explanation relies on impossible explanans. A\nbooklet can no more be an intrinsically borderline book than it can be\nintrinsically misshelved. Fine\u2019s positive thesis is that\nslippery slopes suffice to demonstrate the vagueness of\n\u2018book\u2019. There are borderline books only in the way there\nare heavy books. In contrast to \u2018mass\u2019,\n\u2018heavy\u2019 requires relativization to a gravitational field.\n\u2018Borderline\u2019 requires relativization to a range of\ncases.\n\nMany-valued logicians have long contended that local indeterminacy is\nincompatible with the law of excluded middle. Fine\u2019s (1975)\nsupervaluationism was designed to reconcile the two. But now Fine\nconcedes the incompatibility. Unlike the many-valued logician, Fine\nblames all the inconsistency on local indeterminacy. Indeed, Fine\ncontinues to think the law of excluded middle is undeniable (which is\nnot to say it must be affirmed). What Fine does deny is\nconjunctive excluded middle: (\\(B \\vee \\neg B) \\wedge (C \\vee\n\\neg C) \\wedge (D \\vee \\neg D) \\wedge \\ldots .\\)  For this principle\nimplies that there is a sharp cut-off in a forced-march sorites\nparadox.\n\nSince conjunctive excluded middle is a theorem of classical logic,\nFine proposes a compatibility semantics that bears a family\nresemblance to intuitionism. Fine reconstructs a pedigree by modifying\nSaul Kripke\u2019s semantics for intuitionistic logic. Timothy\nWilliamson (2020) objects that the resulting logic condemns even more\ninnocent inferences than intuitionism. Others defend local\nindeterminacy by saying that there are paradigm cases of intrinsically\nuncertain propositions such as those opening section one. Paradigms\nsuch as the decapitation riddle concern qualitative vagueness rather\nthan the quantitative vagueness that generates a forced-march sorites\nargument. Kit Fine is at work on a future book that may address the\nworry that his account is incomplete or disjunctive.\n9. Is All Vagueness Linguistic?\n\nSupervaluationists emphasize the distinction between words and\nobjects. Objects themselves do not seem to be the sort of thing that\ncan be general, ambiguous, or vague (Eklund 2011). From this\nperspective, Georg Hegel commits a category mistake when he\ncharacterizes clouds as vague. Although we sometimes speak of clouds\nbeing ambiguous or even being general to a region, this does not\nentitle us to infer that there is metaphysical ambiguity or\nmetaphysical generality.\n\nSupervaluationists are seconding a fallacy attribution dating back to\nBertrand Russell\u2019s seminal article \u201cVagueness\u201d\n(1923). This consensus was re-affirmed by Michael Dummett (1975) and\nritualistically re-avowed by subsequent commentators.\n\nIn 1978 Gareth Evans focused opposition to vague objects with a short\nproof modeled after Saul Kripke\u2019s attack on contingent identity.\nIf there is a vague object, then some statement of the form \u2018\\(a\n= b\\)\u2019 must be vague (where each of the flanking singular terms\nprecisely designates that object). For the vagueness is allegedly due\nto the object rather than its representation. But any statement of\nform \u2018\\(a = a\\)\u2019 is definitely true. Consequently, \\(a\\)\nhas the property of being definitely identical to \\(a\\). Since \\(a =\nb\\), then \\(b\\) must also have the property of being definitely\nidentical to \\(a\\). Therefore \u2018\\(a = b\\)\u2019 must be\ndefinitely true!\n\nEvans agrees that there are vague identity statements in which one of\nthe flanking terms is vague (just as Kripke agrees that there are\ncontingent identity statements when one of the flanking terms is a\nflaccid designator). But then the vagueness is due to language, not\nthe world.\n\nDespite Evans\u2019 impressive assault, there was a renewal of\ninterest in vague objects in the 1980s. As a precedent for this\nrevival, Peter van Inwagen (1990, 283) recalls that in the 1960s,\nthere was a consensus that all necessity is linguistic. Most\nphilosophers now take the possibility of essential properties\nseriously.\n\nSome of the reasons are technical. Problems with Kripke\u2019s\nrefutation of contingent identity have structural parallels that\naffect Evans\u2019 proof. Evans also relies on inferences that\ndeviant logicians challenge (Parsons 2000).\n\nIn the absence of a decisive reductio ad absurdum, many\nlogicians feel their role to be the liberal one of articulating the\nlogical space for vague objects. There should be \u2018vague objects\nfor those who want them\u2019 (Cowles and White 1991). Logic should\nbe ontologically neutral.\n\nSince epistemicists try to solve the sorites with little more than a\nresolute application of classical logic, they are methodologically\ncommitted to a partisan role for logic. Instead of looking for\nloopholes, we should accept the consequence (Williamson 2015).\n\nSome non-enemies of vague objects also have an ambition to consolidate\nvarious species of indeterminacy (Barnes and Williams 2011). Talk of\nindeterminacy is found in quantum mechanics, analyses of the open\nfuture, fictional incompleteness, and the continuum hypothesis.\nPerhaps vagueness is just one face of indeterminacy.\n\nThis panoramic vision contrasts with the continuing resolution of many\nto tether vagueness to the sorites paradox (Eklund 2011). They fear\nthat the clarity achieved by semantic ascent will be muddied by\nmetaphysics.\n\nBut maybe the mud is already on the mountain top. Trenton Merricks\n(2001) claims that standard characterizations of linguistic vagueness\nrely on metaphysical vagueness. If \u2018Donald is bald\u2019 lacks\na truth-value because there is no fact to make the statement true,\nthen the shortage appears to be ontological.\n\nThe view that vagueness is always linguistic has been attacked from\nother directions. Consider the vagueness of maps (Varzi 2001). The\nvagueness is pictorial rather than discursive. So one cannot conclude\nthat vagueness is linguistic merely from the premise that vagueness is\nrepresentational.\n\nOr consider vague instrumental music such as Claude Debussy\u2019s\n\u201cThe Clouds\u201d. Music has syntax but too little semantics to\nqualify as language. There is a little diffuse reference through\ndevices such as musical quotation, leitmotifs, and homages. These\nreferential devices are not precise. Therefore, some music is vague\n(Sorensen 2010). The strength and significance of this argument\ndepends on the relationship between music and language. Under the\nmusilanguage hypothesis, language and music branched off from a common\n\u201cmusilanguage\u201d with language specializing in semantics and\nmusic specializing in the expression of emotion. This scenario makes\nit plausible that purely instrumental music could have remnants of\nsemantic meaning.\n\nMental imagery also seems vague. When rising suddenly after a\nprolonged crouch, I \u2018see stars before my eyes\u2019. I can tell\nthere are more than ten of these hallucinated lights but I cannot tell\nhow many. Is this indeterminacy in thought to be reduced to\nindeterminacy in language? Why not vice versa? Language is an\noutgrowth of human psychology. Thus it seems natural to view language\nas merely an accessible intermediate bearer of vagueness.\n",
