    "main_text": "Early Modern Foundations || Cartesian History of Nature\n2.1 Cartesian History of Nature\n\nThe re-introduction of Greek and Roman atomism in the Renaissance,\nwith the recovery (1417) and printing (1473) of Lucretius\u2019s\nphilosophical poem On the Nature of Things (Lucretius,\n[1968]), introduced to a literate European audience a series of\ninfluential cosmological speculations that included a naturalistic\naccount of the origin of species integrated into a non-teleological\nmaterialist cosmology that contrasted markedly with the received\nScholastic, Aristotelian, and Augustinian-Platonic traditions. Into\nthe eighteenth century, these speculations, and those drawn from other\natomist sources (see the entry on natural philosophy in the\nRenaissance), were often in the background of novel early modern\nreflections on species origins and their possible transformation in\ntime (Bowler 2003: chp. 2; Oldroyd 1996; Greene 1959).\n\nA new starting point in systematic reflections on the origin of the\nearth and living beings, showing both some similarity and also major\ndifferences from atomist speculations, dates specifically from the\nsynthesis of natural philosophy and metaphysics put forth by\nRen\u00e9 Descartes (1596\u20131650) in his Principia\nphilosophiae (1st ed. 1644; 2nd ed. 1647). This treatise expanded\nand summarized issues he had developed earlier in Le Monde\n(The World, or Treatise on Light), a work published only\nposthumously in 1664, with an improved edition appearing in 1677. \n\nIt is important for understanding the subsequent reflections on the\n\u201chistory\u201d of nature to recognize that these Cartesian\nspeculations on the history of the earth and solar system were\nintroduced in the form of a counter-factual hypothesis that explicitly\nsought to avoid conflict with accepted theological interpretations of\norigins (Descartes 1647 [1983: 181]). In the hypothetical account\noffered in the Principles of Philosophy, Descartes derived\nthe earth from a cooled star \u201cformerly\u2026like the\nSun\u201d (ibid.). By its gradual solidification in a great celestial\nvortex, the Earth took form. Subsequent drying and cracking formed the\nocean basins, the continents and the mountain ranges.\n\nAn outstanding lacuna in Descartes\u2019s account, however, was his\nfailure to incorporate the origins of living beings into his\nnaturalistic story of creation by natural law. Although manuscripts\ndisplay the degree to which Descartes attempted on several occasions\nto work out some linkage between his general natural philosophy and\nthe embryological formation of living beings, these reflections did\nnot appear in print during his lifetime (Aucante 2006). The\nPrinciples simply skips over the issue of a naturalistic\naccount of the origins of life and the origin of individual species.\nInstead in Part IV, devoted generally to the origin and physical\nproperties of the Earth, he jumps (Proposition 188) from a discussion\nof magnetism to a brief allusion to projected Parts V and VI of his\nPrinciples that would deal with animals and humans (Descartes\n1647 [1983: 275\u2013276]). But the Principles only offers a\nbrief discussion of the various senses and body-soul interaction\nsimilar to that put forth in his early unpublished Treatise on\nMan (1st Latin ed. 1662, 2nd French ed. 1664). These speculations\nwere grounded on the concept of a hypothetical statue- machine created\ndirectly by divine action, and possessed immediately of all human\nfunctions and structures (Descartes 1664 [1972: 1\u20135]).\n\nDescartes\u2019s speculations conveyed to his successors at least two\nissues relevant to the origin and history of living species. First, by\npresenting the historical account of the origin of the solar system\nand the world as a counterfactual hypothesis, a means of understanding\nthe history of nature adapted to the limitations of the human mind,\nrather than as a literally true account, Descartes developed the\ngrounds for a purely fictionalist reading of historical science that\npersisted into the nineteenth century (Sloan 2006a). Second, the\nintegration of living beings into the new natural philosophy of\nmechanistic naturalism was left unresolved. If anything,\nDescartes\u2019s reflections accentuated the problem of providing a\nnaturalistic explanation of the origins of living beings.\n\nTwo traditions can be traced in the wake of Descartes\u2019s\nreflections. Beginning with the De solido intra solidum\nnaturaliter contento dissertationis prodromus of 1669 [1916] by\nthe Danish Cartesian Nicholas Steno (1638\u201386), efforts commenced\nto draw the historical origins of living beings into the Cartesian\ncosmology, in this case primarily by granting that fossils were the\nremains of once existing organisms on an earth that had formed\nhistorically. There was, however, no effort made to account for the\norigins of these beings on Cartesian principles (Steno 1669 [1916],\nRudwick 1972, 2005).\n\nA second tradition sought to give a \u201crealist\u201d\ninterpretation of the history of the earth by reconciling this with\nthe account of Genesis. Such a synthesis was the specific\neffort of the English clergyman, Thomas Burnet (1635\u20131715).\nBurnet sought to reconcile a Cartesian-derived historical account of\nthe origins of the Earth with the creation account of the Mosaic\ntradition. In Burnet\u2019s account, the Earth began from an original\nchaos fashioned by divine action into the existing Earth through a\nseries of changes that involved the gradual separation of the\ncontinents, the reversal of the poles, and the Mosaic flood. To\nexplain the origin of living beings, Burnet relied on the\n\u201cspontaneous fruitfulness of the ground\u201d in the primeval\nEdenic world, similar to the Augustine theory of the created\nrationales seminales, rather than on the direct creation of\ncomplete forms through divine action (Burnet 1684: bk 2, chp. 2, para.\n4, p. 187 [1965: 141]). By connecting this account to the Biblical\nstory of the first chapter of Genesis, Burnet broke with\nCartesian counterfactualism, offering for the first time a presumably\nliteral interpretation of a Cartesian-style developmental history of\nnature that also included the origins of living forms.\n",
