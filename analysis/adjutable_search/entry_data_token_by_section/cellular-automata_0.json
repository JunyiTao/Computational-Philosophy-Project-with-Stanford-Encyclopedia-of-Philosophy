    "main_text": "Introduction || Getting Started: A Very Simple CA\n1.1 Getting Started: A Very Simple CA\n\nWe introduce CA using a simple example. Think of an automaton as a\none-dimensional grid of simple elements (the cells). Each of them can\nonly instantiate one of two states; let us say that each cell can be\nturned on or off. The evolution of the system is\ndetermined by a transition rule, to be thought of as implemented in\neach cell. At each time step, each cell updates its status in response\nto what happens to its neighboring cells, following the rule.\n\n\n\nFig. 1\n\n\nAlthough CA are abstract, having a concrete instance in mind can help\nin the beginning. So think of\n Fig. 1\n as representing the front row of a high school classroom. Each box\nstands for a student wearing (black) or not wearing (white) a hat. Let\nus make the two following assumptions: \n\n\nHat rule: a student will wear the hat in the following class\nif one or the other\u2014but not both\u2014of the two classmates\nsitting immediately on her left and on her right has the hat in the\ncurrent class (if nobody wears a hat, a hat is out of fashion; but if\nboth neighbors wear it, a hat is now too popular to be trendy). \n\nInitial class: during the first class in the morning, only\none student in the middle shows up with a hat (see\n Fig. 2).\n\n\n\n\nFig. 2\n\n\nFig. 3\n shows what happens as time goes by. Consecutive rows represent the\nevolution in time through subsequent classes. \n\n\n\n\nFig. 3\n\n\n\nFig. 3\n may be surprising. The evolutionary pattern displayed contrasts with\nthe simplicity of the underlying law (the \u201cHat rule\u201d) and\nontology (for in terms of object and properties, we only need to take\ninto account simple cells and two states). The global, emergent\nbehavior of the system supervenes upon its local, simple features, at\nleast in the following sense: the scale at which the decision to wear\nthe hat is made (immediate neighbors) is not the scale at which the\ninteresting patterns become manifest. \n\n\nThis example is a paradigmatic illustration of what makes CA appealing\nto a vast range of researchers: \n\n\neven perfect knowledge of individual decision rules does not always\nallow us to predict macroscopic structure. We get macro-surprises\ndespite complete micro-knowledge. (Epstein 1999: 48) \n\n\nSince the notion of emergence and the micro-macro interplay\nhave such an important role in science and philosophy (see the entries\non\n supervenience\n and\n emergent properties;\n for a sample of scientific applications, see Mitchell 2009:\n2\u201313; Gell-Mann 1994: Ch. 9), it has been suggested that many\nscientific as well as conceptual puzzles can be addressed by adopting\nthe CA perspective. Stephen Wolfram has gone as far as claiming that\nCA may help us to solve longstanding issues in philosophy: \n\nAmong them [the fundamental issues philosophers address] are questions\nabout the ultimate limits of knowledge, free will, the uniqueness of\nthe human condition and the inevitability of mathematics. Much has\nbeen said over the course of philosophical history about each of\nthese. Yet inevitably it has been informed only by current intuitions\nabout how things are supposed to work. But my discoveries in this book\n[A New Kind of Science] lead to radically new intuitions.\n(Wolfram 2002: 10)\n\n\nThese are very bold claims. In order to assess them, let us take a\ncloser look at the field. \n",
