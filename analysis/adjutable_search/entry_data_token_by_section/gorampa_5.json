    "main_text": "Gorampa\u2019s Madhyamaka || Methods of Argumentation\n2.4 Methods of Argumentation\n\nGorampa\u2019s emphasis on the possibility for different acceptable\nstyles of argumentation occurs in the context of his analysis of the\nso-called Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika and Sv\u0101tantrika subschools of\nMadhyamaka thought. These two subschools were understood by Tibetan\nthinkers as being developed by the Indian M\u0101dhyamikas\nBuddhap\u0101lita and Bh\u0101viveka, the former advocating the\nPr\u0101sa\u1e45gika position and the latter that of the\nSv\u0101tantrika. Candrak\u012brti is understood as upholding the\nPr\u0101sa\u1e45gika tradition, because he defended\nBuddhap\u0101lita\u2019s views against Bh\u0101viveka\u2019s\ncriticisms. It is important to note, however, that none of these\nIndian scholars labeled themselves as adherents of particular\nsubschools of Madhyamaka, and that the terms rang gyud pa\n(Sv\u0101tantrika) and thal \u2018gyur ba (Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika)\nwere coined centuries later by Tibetans.\n\nRegardless of whether Buddhap\u0101lita, Bh\u0101viveka, or\nCandrak\u012brti actually understood themselves to be advocating these\ndistinct positions, the differentiation between Sv\u0101tantrika and\nPr\u0101sa\u1e45gika became reified in medieval Tibetan Buddhist\ndiscourse. Because Tibetans held Candrak\u012brti\u2019s Madhyamaka\nin high regard, they purported to be Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gikas\nthemselves, and many constructed detailed explanations of the division\nbetween the Sv\u0101tantrika and Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika systems, always\nupholding Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika as the highest form of Madhyamaka.\n\nTsongkhapa famously composed a list of \u201ceight difficult\npoints\u201d (dka\u2019 gnad brgyad) distinguishing his own\nPr\u0101sa\u1e45gika view from that of the Sv\u0101tantrika. Based on\nthese eight points, Tsongkhapa concluded that the two schools to\ndiffer in terms of their views regarding the nature of the ultimate\ntruth.\n\nGorampa also considers himself a Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika, but insists\nthat the distinction between these two Madhyamaka subschools is a\nmatter of method, not view. Because Gorampa\u2019s interpretation of\nthe two truths and negation informs a process by which the\nM\u0101dhyamika begins with logic and analysis, and ends in a state of\nnonconceptuality, Gorampa contends that there can be no differences\nbetween M\u0101dhyamikas with respect to their final view. There\ncannot be different types of nonconceptuality; the end result of any\ntrue Madhyamaka analysis is freedom from conceptual proliferations.\nOnce one has successfully eradicated conceptual thought, the methods\nthat she has used to arrive at such a state are no longer relevant.\nThe differences between these Madhyamaka subschools, therefore, occur\nwith respect to the ways in which they understand the conventional\ntruth, and utilize logic and reasoning.\n\nIn short, Gorampa\u2019s particular brand of Madhyamaka is\ncharacterized by his understanding of the two truths, and the ways in\nwhich negation functions within the logic of tetralemmic analysis.\nBecause the ultimate truth is entirely free from concepts, one\nutilizes negation to eliminate all concepts in their entirety. The\nways in which one employs Madhyamaka reasoning in order to negate\nthese concepts are ultimately not as important as actually arriving at\na state of nonconceptuality. Thus, unlike Tsongkhapa, who concludes\nthat there is one correct final view, Gorampa contends that the final,\nultimate view is actually no view at all.\n",
