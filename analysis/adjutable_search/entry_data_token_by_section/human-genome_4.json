According to Dulbecco (1986), \u201cthe\nsequence of the human DNA is the reality of our species\u201d (p.\n1056); Gilbert was quoted as saying \u201csequencing the human genome\nis like pursuing the holy grail\u201d (in Lee 1991, p. 9); on the\ntopic of his decision to dedicate three percent of HGP funds to ELSI,\nWatson wrote: \u201cThe Human Genome Project is much more than a vast\nroll call of As, Ts, Gs, and Cs: it is as precious a body of knowledge\nas humankind will ever acquire, with a potential to speak to our most\nbasic philosophical questions about human nature, for purposes of good\nand mischief alike\u201d (with Berry 2003, p. 172).\n\n\u201cGeneticization\u201d is a term used to describe the phenomenon\ncharacterized by an increasing tendency to reduce human differences to\ngenetic ones (Lippman 1991). The several billion dollars of funding\nfor the HGP was justified by the belief that genes are key\ndeterminants of not only rare Mendelian diseases like\nHuntington\u2019s disease or cystic fibrosis but common\nmulti-factorial conditions like cancer, depression, and heart disease.\nWrote an early critic of the HGP: \u201cWithout question, it was the\ntechnical prowess that molecular biology had achieved by the early\n1980s that made it possible even to imagine a task as formidable as\nthat of sequencing what has come to be called \u2018the human\ngenome.\u2019 But it was the concept of genetic disease that created\nthe climate in which such a project could appear both reasonable and\ndesirable\u201d (Keller 1992, p. 293). Given that the development of\nany trait involves the interaction of both genetic and nongenetic\nfactors, on what bases can genes be privileged as causes to claim that\na particular disease or nondisease trait is \u201cgenetic\u201d or\ncaused by a \u201cgenetic susceptibility\u201d or \u201cgenetic\npredisposition\u201d? This question has led philosophers of science\nto grapple with appropriate definitions for terms such as\n\u201cgenetic disease\u201d and \u201cgenetic susceptibility\u201d\nand how best to conceptualize genetic causation and\ngene\u2013environment interaction (e.g., Kitcher 1996; Gannett 1999;\nKronfeldner 2009). Closely related to the concepts of geneticization\nand genetic disease/ susceptibility/ predisposition are assumptions\nabout genetic reductionism and genetic determinism.\n\nGenetic reductionism can be understood as governing the\nwhole\u2013part relation in which organismal properties are explained\nsolely in terms of genes and organisms are identified with their\ngenomes. Definitions of health and disease attach to organisms and\ntheir physiological and developmental processes in particular contexts\n(provided by populations and environments) and cannot simply be\nrelocated to the level of the genome (Griesemer 1994; Limoges 1994;\nLloyd 1994), however, and diseases do not become more objectively\ndefined entities once they receive a genetic basis since social and\ncultural values implicated in designations of health and disease can\nbecome incorporated at the level of the genome, in what counts as a\nnormal or abnormal gene (Gannett 1998). In contrast to physical\nreductionism, which does not privilege DNA but considers it on par\nwith proteins, lipids, and other molecules (Sarkar 1998), genetic\nreductionism assumes that genes are in some sense more causally\nefficacious. Genetic determinism concerns such assumptions about the\ncausal efficacy of genes.\n\nIn a public lecture held to celebrate completion of the HGP, Collins\ncharacterized the project as \u201can amazing adventure into\nourselves, to understand our own DNA instruction book, the shared\ninheritance of all humankind\u201d (see National Human Genome\nResearch Institute, 2003). At the cellular level, the book is said to\ncontain \u201cthe genetic instructions for the entire repertoire of\ncellular components\u201d (Collins et al. 2003, p. 3). At this level,\ngenetic determinism is sustained by metaphors of Weismannism and DNA\nas \u201ccode\u201d or \u201cmaster molecule\u201d (Griesemer\n1994; Keller 1994), which accord DNA causal priority over other\ncellular components. This may be in a physical sense: Weismannism\nassumes (falsely) that intergenerational continuity exists only for\ngerm cell nuclei whereas somatic cells and germ cell cytoplasm arise\nanew in each generation. It may also be in the sense of a point of\norigin for the transfer of information: the central dogma of molecular\nbiology, which represents a 1950s reformulation of Weismannism in\nterms of information theory, asserts that information travels\nunidirectionally from nucleic acids to protein, and never vice versa.\nIt is contentious, however, whether amongst the cell\u2019s\ncomponents only nucleic acids can be said to transmit information: for\nsome philosophers, genetic coding plays a theoretical role at least at\nthis cellular level (Godfrey-Smith 2000); for others, genetic coding\nis merely (and misleadingly) metaphorical, and all cellular components\nare potential bearers of information (Griffiths 2001; Griffiths and\nGray 1994; Sarkar 1996).\n\nAt the organismal level, new research in functional genomics may lead\nto less deterministic accounts even of so-called single gene\ndisorders. For these, the concepts of penetrance and expressivity\noperate in ways that accommodate the one\u2013one genetic determinist\nmodel where the mutation is necessary and/or sufficient for both the\npresence of the condition and confounding patterns of phenotypic\nvariability. But the severity of even a fully penetrant condition like\nHuntington\u2019s disease seems to depend on not just genetic factors\nlike the number of DNA repeats in the mutation but epigenetic factors\nlike the sex of the parent who transmitted the mutation (Ridley et al.\n1991). For complex conditions to which both genetic and environmental\ndifferences contribute\u2014for example, psychiatric disorders or\nbehavioral differences\u2014genetic determinism is denied, and\neveryone is an interactionist these days, in some sense of\n\u201cinteraction.\u201d Both genes and environment are recognized\nto be necessary for development: by themselves, genes cannot determine\nor do anything. Yet, theorists still seem to give the nod to one or\nthe other, suggesting that it is mostly genes or mostly the\nenvironment, mostly nature or mostly nurture, that make us what we\nare. This implies that it is possible to apportion the relative\ncontributions of each. Gilbert (1992) suggests this in his dismissal\nof a more simplistic version of genetic determinism: \u201cWe must\nsee beyond a first reaction that we are the consequences of our genes;\nthat we are guilty of a crime because our genes made us do it; or that\nwe are noble because our genes made us so. This shallow genetic\ndeterminism is unwise and untrue. But society will have to wrestle\nwith the questions of how much of our makeup is dictated by the\nenvironment, how much is dictated by our genetics, and how much is\ndictated by our own will and determination\u201d (pp. 96\u201397).\nHowever, the assertion that the relative contributions of genes and\nenvironment can be apportioned in this way is misleading if not\noutright false. Building on R. C. Lewontin\u2019s (1974) classic\npaper on heritability, work in developmental systems theory (DST)\nundermines any such attempts to apportion causal responsibility in\norganismal development: traits are jointly determined by multiple\ncauses, each context-sensitive and contingent (Griffiths and Gray\n1994; Griffiths and Knight 1998; Oyama 1985; Oyama et al. 2001; Robert\n2004).\n\nGeneticization, genetic reductionism, and genetic determinism helped\nto sell the HGP. Gilbert (1992) endorsed the reduction of individual\nhumans to their genes: \u201cThe information carried on the DNA, that\ngenetic information passed down from our parents,\u201d he wrote,\n\u201cis the most fundamental property of the body\u201d (p. 83), so\nmuch so, in fact, that \u201cone will be able to pull a CD out of\none\u2019s pocket and say, \u2018Here is a human being; it\u2019s\nme!\u2019\u201d (p. 96). Cancers that we consider to be\nenvironmental in their origins were recast as genetically determined.\nIn Watson\u2019s words: \u201cSome call New Jersey the Cancer State\nbecause of all the chemical companies there, but in fact, the major\nfactor is probably your genetic constitution\u201d (in Cooper 1994,\np. 326). In Bodmer\u2019s words: \u201cCancer, scientists have\ndiscovered, is a genetic condition in which cells spread\nuncontrollably, and cigarette smoke contains chemicals which stimulate\nthose molecular changes\u201d (Bodmer and McKie 1994, p. 89). (See\nProctor 1992 and Plutynski 2018 for discussions of cancer as a genetic\ndisease.) Marking the 20th anniversary of the release of\nthe draft sequences, Richard Gibbs, director of the sequencing center\nat Baylor, admits that \u201cthere was plenty of hype that was shared\nwith the media and the wider community\u201d and that such\n\u201coutlandish visions\u201d as personalizing therapies, revealing\nthe \u201cmysteries of the architecture of common complex\ndiseases,\u201d and predicting criminality have not been realized.\nBut Gibbs excuses the hype as necessary for generating support for the\nproject: \u201cThe hyperbole that we look back on did not, however,\ncome from the front line. It came from those who championed the\nprogramme, mindful of its long-term benefits. Thanks to them, they\ngenerated the enthusiasm to fund this transformative work\u201d\n(2020, p. 575).\n\nLike Gibbs, bioethicist Timothy Caulfield (2018) finds the hype and\nhyperbole of scientists understandable: \u201cEnthusiasm and\noptimistic predictions of near-future applications are required in\norder to mobilize the scientific community and potential funders, both\npublic and private. This is particularly so in areas like genomics,\nwhere large amounts of sustained funding are required in order to\nachieve the hoped for scientific and translational goals\u201d (p.\n561). However, unlike Gibbs, Caulfield details possibilities of\n\u201creal harm,\u201d which include \u201cpotentially eroding\npublic trust and support for science; inappropriately skewing research\npriorities and the allocation of resources and funding; creating\nunrealistic expectations of benefit for patients; facilitating the\npremature uptake of expensive and potentially harmful emerging\ntechnologies by health systems; misinforming policy and ethics\ndebates; and accelerating the marketing and utilization of unproven\ntherapies\u201d (p. 567). The hype and hyperbole used to promote\npersonalized (or precision) medicine carry the risks Caulfield\nmentions.\n\nApproaching 20 years since completion of the HGP, genome science has\nnot revolutionized medicine or markedly improved human health.\nProgress has been made on rare diseases (e.g., spinal muscular\natrophy) and some forms of cancer (e.g., non-small cell lung cancer),\nthough these interventions can be prohibitively expensive (Tabery\n2023). For most complex diseases, however, predictions based on\n\u201cfamily history, neighborhood, socioeconomic circumstances, or\neven measurements made with nothing more than a tape measure and a\nbathroom scale\u201d outperform predictions based on the possession\nof genetic variants identified by GWAS. Pressing public health\nproblems such as increasing obesity, the opiate epidemic, and mental\nillness fail to be addressed by the \u201chuman genome-driven\nresearch agenda\u201d to which the lion\u2019s share of resources go\n(Joyner and Paneth 2019). So even though the deterministic and\nreductionistic assumptions underlying the HGP have been undermined by\nthe research in molecular biology the project made possible (Keller\n2000), the critics\u2019 worries about geneticization, genetic\nreductionism, and genetic determinism remain relevant, in particular\ntheir belief that embracing a reductionist approach to medicine that\nconceives of human health and disease in wholly molecular or genetic\nterms individualizes these and detracts attention from risks factors\nassociated with our shared social and physical environments (Nelkin\nand Tancredi 1989; Hubbard and Wald 1993; Tabery 2023).\n",
