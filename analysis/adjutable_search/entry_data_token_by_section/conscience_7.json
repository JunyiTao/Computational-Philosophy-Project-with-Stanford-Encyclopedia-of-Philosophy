Freedom of conscience\n\nSome people have suggested that appeals to freedom of\nconscience tend to be more vigorously put forward and more effective\nin contexts where political or religious structures lose power or\nmoral authority. Thus, for instance, according to C.A. Pierce:\n\nconscience only came into its own in the Greek world after the\ncollapse of the city-state. The close integration of politics with\nethics, with the former predominant, was no longer possible: there was\nno sufficiently close authority, external to the individual,\neffectively to direct conduct. Consequently, as a pis aller,\nmen fell back on the internal chastisement of the conscience as the\nonly authority. (Pierce 1955: 76)\n\n\nThe same can be said for 17th Century England, with its\ncrisis of religious authority and the frequent appeals to freedom of\nconscience in the philosophical and political literature of that time\n(Childress 1979: 326).\n\nThere are three main arguments that can be used to defend a principle\nof freedom of conscience. Two of them are frequently found in the\n16th and 17th Century philosophical literature:\nthey are the \u201cargument from ineffectiveness or hypocrisy\u201d\nand the \u201cargument from ignorance\u201d (Sorabji 2014: 139). A\nthird argument, which might be called \u201cargument from\nlegitimization\u201d, was put forward by John Stuart Mill. Let us\nexamine them in order.\n\na) The argument from ineffectiveness or hypocrisy is based on\nthe relevance of the distinction between beliefs and acts for the\ndefinition of conscience. According to this argument, it is not\npossible to compel someone to believe or to not believe something,\ni.e., to change one\u2019s conscientious beliefs. All we can do is\ncompel people to act as if they believed something, which\nwould be a hypocritical behavior. Therefore, if some authority aims to\nconvert people or to change people\u2019s moral views, prohibiting\nthe free expression, through actions, of one\u2019s\nconscience would not serve this purpose.\n\nThis line of argument was often put forward by early Christians, most\nnotably Christian apologist Tertullian, to defend their freedom to\npractice their cult in a time where they were persecuted by Roman\ngovernors: their claim was that forcing them to abandon the Christian\ncults would have no effect on their conscience. The same line of\nargument can also be found in Locke\u2019s works on toleration, the\nEssay Concerning Toleration of 1667 and A Letter\nConcerning Toleration of 1689.\n\nHowever, Christians did not seem to believe in the force of this\nargument, and more generally in the principle of freedom of\nconscience, when, later on, they attempted to justify the violent\npersecution of heretics (those who revise their religious dogmas) and\napostates (those who abandon their religion) and their forced\nconversion (Clarke 2014: 118\u2013123). Two main justifications have\nbeen given by Christian theologians for the forced conversion of\nheretics and apostates.\n\nOne can be found, among others, in Aquinas and Calvin, who thought\nthat violent persecution is justified because heretics\u2019 mistaken\nviews would exert great influence on many ordinary people. By\ndeparting from the Christian doctrine, these people would be condemned\nto eternal damnation in the afterlife, and Christians have a duty to\nsave as many people as possible from eternal damnation (Clarke 2014:\n120\u2013121).\n\nA second type of argument in defense of violent persecution is the one\noffered by Augustine (5th Century). He argued that\ncompelling people to follow the true religion\u2014by which he meant\npersecuting heretics\u2014could open their eyes to the truth (Sorabji\n2014: 49\u201350). This thesis implies that sometimes conscience,\neven if we confine it to matters of inward conviction and not to\nbehavior, can be influenced by some external imposition.\n\nThis latter approach based on the idea of bringing the truth to\nconscience by \u201cfreeing\u201d conscience from error is\nconsistent with the Catholic peculiar understanding of the notion of\nfreedom of conscience. Philosophically speaking, \u201cfreedom of\nconscience\u201d is typically understood as an individualistic\nconcept that allows for a plurality of moral and religious views\n(Strohm 2011: 90). For the Catholic Church, however,\nauthentic freedom is inseparable from the notion of truth.\nInspired by the works of the English theologian and cardinal John\nHenry Newman, Joseph Ratzinger writes that in the Catholic view\n\u201ctruth\u201d is the middle term that reconciles authority of\nGod and subjectivity of conscience: the latter, when authentically\nfree, cannot but reveal the truth established by the former (Ratzinger\n1991). Since, as we have seen above, in the Catholic view reason alone\ncan\u2019t create its own values, which are instilled by God into\nhumans\u2019 hearts, \u201chuman freedom finds its authentic and\ncomplete fulfillment precisely in the acceptance of that law\u201d of\nGod (John Paul II 1993: par. 35). So when practical reason is free to\nexercise its \u201cparticipation\u201d (John Paul II 1993: sec. 40)\nin the divine law, then \u201cin the depths of his conscience, man\ndetects a law which he does not impose upon himself, but which holds\nhim to obedience\u201d (Paul VI 1965: par. 16).\n\nIn any case, it is not necessary to dismiss the argument from\nineffectiveness in order to justify imposing norms and practices that\nmight violate individuals\u2019 conscience. Actually, the same\nargument from ineffectiveness can be used to support the imposition of\npolicies that might conflict with individuals\u2019 consciences. On\nthe basis of the idea that conscience is merely a matter of private\nbeliefs, not of action, some authors have argued that compelling\npeople to follow certain rules even against their conscience would not\nconstitute a violation of their freedom of conscience, and is\ntherefore justifiable. This was the line of argument pursued, for\nexample, by Thomas Hobbes (1651: chapter 40), Baruch Spinoza (1670:\nchapter 20) and John Locke (1660), who argued that the State has the\npower to enforce certain practices even when citizens claim that it\nwould violate their conscience, in order to protect social order.\n\nb) The \u201cargument from ignorance\u201d, which might be\nbetter labeled \u201cargument from humility\u201d, is based\non a skeptical approach to the content of conscience. The possibility\nexists that what we conscientiously believe is wrong and that those\nholding conscientious beliefs opposite to ours are right. Therefore,\nthere is a reason for not forcing anyone to believe in something or to\nengage in behaviors that might turn out to be morally wrong. The\nargument from ignorance or humility started to be put forward quite\nfrequently, and most prominently by Pierre Bayle (1686\u20131688),\nafter the Catholic Church lost a significant proportion of its\nreligious and moral authority following the Protestant reform in\n16th and 17th Century\u2014which was defined by\nKeith Thomas (1993) as \u201cthe age of conscience\u201d. It was at\nthat time that we assisted to the \u201csecularization of\nconscience\u201d in the modern era (Strohm 2011), although the\nphenomenon would be better conceived of as a\n\u201cre-secularization\u201d, since conscience was not related to\nthe voice or the authority of God in the Greek world.\n\nThe same argument from ignorance or from humility is also put forward\nby John Locke in his Second Letter Concerning Toleration.\nLocke had to rely on this argument as an alternative strategy to\ndefend freedom of conscience after the Anglican priest Jonas Proast\npointed out that compulsion can actually change personal beliefs (as\nAugustine had argued), and that therefore the argument from\nineffectiveness that Locke had used in his first Letter fails\n(Sorabji 2014: 151).\n\nA version of the argument from ignorance can also be found in\ncontemporary defenses of conscientious objection in an age where\npluralism of worldviews is acknowledged and actually supported. For\nexample, Sulmasy appeals to epistemic humility as \u201ctrue basis of\ntolerance\u201d (Sulmasy 2008: 144) in his arguments in support of a\nright to conscientious objection in health care. \n\nc) Finally, the third argument in defense of freedom of conscience is\nwhat I have called above the \u201cargument from\nlegitimization\u201d. John Stuart Mill (1859) defended freedom\nof conscience by appealing to the idea that allowing the free\nexpression of any opinion, and particularly mistaken opinions, would\nallow truth to emerge more clearly and would provide us with a\njustification for acting upon our own beliefs, once they have been\nassessed against others\u2019 opinions. As put by Mill, \n\n\n[c]omplete liberty of contradicting and disproving our opinion, is the\nvery condition which justifies us in assuming its truth for purposes\nof action; and on no other terms can a being with human faculties have\nany rational assurance of being right. (Mill 1859: ch. 2)\n\n",
