    "main_text": "Locality and Special Relativity || Singlet state of spin-half particles\n8.1 Singlet state of spin-half particles\nThe Bohm version (Bohm 1951: Chapter\n22) of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen\nparadox (Einstein, Podolsky, & Rosen\n1935) is based on the spin singlet state\n\\[\\ket{\\psi_0} = \\bigl( \\ket{z^+_a,z^+_b} - \\ket{z^-_a,z^-_b}\n\\bigr) \\label{eqn41}\\]\nof two spin-half particles \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), using the same notation as\nin subsection 2.3. This is said to be\nan entangled state because it is not a product state of the\nform \\(\\ket{a,b} = \\ket{a}\\otimes\\ket{b}\\). It is easy to show that the\ncorresponding projector \\([\\psi_0]\\) does not commute with any projector\non a nontrivial property of particle \\(a\\), such as \\([z^+_a]\\), or on a\nnontrivial property of \\(b\\). (The trivial properties are the identity\nand the zero projector.) Thus a quantum description that contains\n\\([\\psi_0]\\) as a property cannot at the same time ascribe any\nnontrivial properties to either of the particles.\nThis is a mathematical fact which makes no reference to where the\nparticles are located in space. It is true for the ground state of a\nhydrogen atom, in which the electron and proton are on top of each\nother, as well as for the situation we consider next in which particle\n\\(a\\) is in Alice\u2019s laboratory and \\(b\\) in Bob\u2019s laboratory some distance\naway. Suppose that Alice measures \\(S_{az}\\) for her particle and Bob\nmeasures \\(S_{bz}\\) for his. Then using \\([\\psi_0]\\) as a\npre-probability, subsection 3.5, one\ncan show that the outcomes, although they are random, will always be\nopposite: if Alice obtains \\(+1/2\\) (in units of \\(\\hbar\\)), Bob will find\n\\(-1/2\\); if Alice obtains \\(-1/2\\), Bob will find \\(+1/2\\).\nCorrelated outcomes are by themselves not surprising once one\naccepts the idea that quantum mechanics is stochastic, not\ndeterministic. Here is a classical analogy: Charlie in Chicago places\na red slip of paper in an opaque envelope and a green slip in a second\nidentical envelope, and after shuffling them chooses one at random and\nmails it to Alice in Atlanta and the other to Bob in Boston. Upon\nopening her envelope and finding a red slip, Alice can at once\nconclude from her knowledge of the protocol that Bob\u2019s envelope\ncontains a green slip of paper. There is no need to invoke some\nsuperluminal influence to explain this.\nHer reasoning is exactly the same in the case where Charlie\nprepares a spin singlet state at the center of the laboratory and\nsends the two particles in opposite directions towards apparatuses\nconstructed by Alice and Bob, both competent experimentalists, and\nAlice measures \\(S_{az}\\). From her measurement outcome and because she\nis a competent experimentalist she is entitled to conclude that before\nthe measurement took place particle \\(a\\) possessed the value indicated\nlater by the pointer position; see the discussion\nin subsection 7.2. Assume for the sake of\ndiscussion that this was \\(S_{az} = +1/2\\). Then from her knowledge of\nthe protocol (initial singlet state) she can assign a state\n\\(S_{bz}=-1/2\\) to Bob\u2019s particle and use this (as a pre-probability) to\nassign a probability to the outcome of a measurement of \\(S_{bz}\\). She\nemploys a scheme of probabilistic inference appropriate to the quantum\nworld; there is no need to invoke wave function collapse except,\nperhaps, as a handy calculational tool.\nBut suppose Bob rather than measuring \\(S_{bz}\\) measures some other\ncomponent \\(S_{bw}\\) of the spin of particle \\(b\\), where \\(w\\) could be \\(x\\)\nor \\(y\\) or some arbitrary direction in space? Again, Alice on the basis\nof her measurement outcome can still assign an \\(S_{bz}\\) value to Bob\u2019s\nparticle before measurement, and use it as a pre-probability to\ncalculate a probability for Bob\u2019s measurement outcome. Conversely,\ngiven the outcome of his \\(S_{bw}\\) measurement (and knowledge of the\nprotocol) Bob can assign a state \\(S_{aw}\\) to Alice\u2019s particle before\nit is measured, and use that to predict the outcome of a measurement\nof \\(S_{az}\\). Both reasoning processes follow the rules indicated above\nin subsection 5.1, but when \\(w\\) is neither \\(z\\)\nnor \\(-z\\) the single framework rule means they cannot be combined. It\nis at this point that quantum principles must be used, unlike the\nanalysis applicable to colored slips of paper, where one can employ\nthe single quasiclassical framework (section 6)\nappropriate for macroscopic physics.\nIf Alice measured \\(S_{az}\\), then surely she could have\ninstead measured \\(S_{ax}\\) perhaps making the choice between this and\n\\(S_{az}\\) at the very last instant, even after Bob has completed his\nmeasurement; what would have occurred in that situation? This\nis a counterfactual question of the form discussed\nin subsection 5.2, \nand we refer the reader to the references given there.\n",
