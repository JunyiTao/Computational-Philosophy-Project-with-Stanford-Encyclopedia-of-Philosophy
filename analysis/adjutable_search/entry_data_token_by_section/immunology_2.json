    "main_text": "Organism-Level Functions of the Immune System || Diachronic identity\n2.1 Diachronic identity\n\nThe diachronic identity of an organism, its capacity to remain the\nsame despite transformations, has puzzled philosophers since ancient\nGreece. Aristotle postulated the existence of immutable forms, that,\nbeing distinct from fluctuating matter, ensure the continued identity\nof living creatures (Categories,\n3b22\u201333; Metaphysics, Book D).  Dissatisfied with this\nsolution, Locke proposed that temporal identity of animals and plants\nis not ensured by their unvarying forms, but rather by the continuity\nof their lived life (Locke 1689, II.27.4 and II.27.8; Kaufman\n2016). In the context of contemporary philosophy of biology, the\nimportance of continuous identity was emphasized by Hull who argued\nthat species lack essences and thus should be considered historical\nindividuals with their own inner coherence and persistence conditions\nnot unlike those of other living creatures (Hull 1978). He assumed\nthat these persistence conditions are provided by continuity of\nchanges in biological organization of these individuals so that only\nan abrupt disruption could cause a loss or change of identity (Hull\n1992; Hull 1978: 355).  This latter perspective has recently been\nadopted by advocates of animalism, who argue that continuity of\nphysiological processes (organic animalism) or maintenance of\ncharacteristic structural organization (somatic animalism) are\nnecessary for diachronic identity (Olson 1997; van Inwagen 1990;\nMackie 1999; see the entry on\n animalism).\n\nImmunology steps into the diachronic identity debate with\nBurnet\u2019s hypothesis that during embryonic development, the\nimmune system learns to tolerate a defined set of molecules as\n\u201cself\u201d (Burnet 1959: 59). He proposed that autoreactive\nimmune cells (lymphocytes) were purged during embryonic development to\nleave only those lymphocytes that ignore specific antigens encountered\nduring this early stage (Burnet 1957). Defined negatively by a gap in\nthe lymphocyte repertoire, immunological selfhood was assumed to\npersist in the adult as an invariant molecular \u2018essence\u2019\nof the organism, analogous to an unwavering psychological ego (Burnet\n1959; Tauber 1994: 194). As observed by Pradeu and Carosella, this\nself/nonself model supported a substantialist view of identity in so\nfar as it presupposed that the immune system ensures integrity of a\npreserved metaphysical core (Pradeu and Carosella 2006a: 246).\n\nTo provide a distinct view of the immune system\u2019s role in\ndiachronic identity, Pradeu advocates the so-called\n\u201cgenidentity\u201d view (Pradeu 2018). On this view, two\nobjects are identical if their states are continuously connected over\ntime (Lewin 1922). To specify which continuous states ensure temporal\nidentity of an organism, Pradeu refers to those \u201cimmune\ninteractions [that] isolate some continuous biochemical interactions,\nwhich in turn individuate the organism\u201d (Pradeu 2012:\n248\u2013249). Accordingly, the immune system reacts to rapid\nmolecular alterations in the pattern of biochemical interactions and\nthus helps to ensure that these interactions are continuous and\nunperturbed. Of note, which continuous process should be followed to\ndefine diachronic identity is not observer independent and must be\nadjusted to a particular theoretical perspective (Guay and Pradeu\n2016: 318; Pradeu 2018).\n\nHowever, the idea that the immune system contributes to organismal\nidentity maintenance has to be weighed against evidence\nsuggesting that immunity contributes to the accommodation of\nchange. At the end of the nineteenth century, Metchnikoff\nproposed that phagocytes (primitive immune cells) were agents of\norganismal transformation, driving metamorphic and developmental\nalterations (Metchnikoff 1901 [1905]; Tauber and Chernyak 1991). This\nearly view has been supported by recent evidence that the immune\nsystem actively participates in mediating transformations in\norganismal identity by constantly redefining and modulating immune\nreactivity towards endogenous and exogenous molecules (Tauber 2017).\nThis is most apparent during development as illustrated by the\nactivity of brain-resident macrophages (microglia), which, by\nimpacting angiogenesis/vascularization, as well as the migration,\nproliferation and apoptosis of neurons, influence social behavioral\nand sexual identity (Wynn, Chawla, and Pollard.2013; Lenz and Nelson\n2018).\n\nTolerance of newly encountered antigens demonstrates the\n\u201cfluid\u201d state of the reactive immune repertoire that\nundergoes alteration over the lifespan of the organism (Grignolio et\nal. 2014). And with a changing \u201cimmune biography\u201d,\nbiological identity no longer conforms to the simple binary division\nof self and nonself that has hitherto characterized immune\ntheorizing. Accordingly, animals have no immutable molecular essence\nthat would ensure persistence of identity, at least as determined by\nimmune tolerance or rejection (Le\u00f3n-Letelier, Bonifaz, and\nFuentes-Panan\u00e1 2019). Identity then becomes an ever-changing\nprocess of accepted transformations and rejected entries. From this\nvantage point, the animalist definitions of diachronic identity as a\nmere persistence of life or even an underlying constancy fails to\naccount for the dynamic quality of immune-mediated identity\ntransitions (van Inwagen 1990: 148\u2013149; Olson 1997; Mackie 1999;\nRoy and Hebrok 2015; Dupr\u00e9 2017). Consequently, the immune\nprocessual point of view defines organismal persistence as \u201ca\ncoordinated group of changes\u201d rather than as an\ninvariant state or a continuous connection between such states. This\nunderstanding has important implications for philosophy of biology and\nontology, more generally (Dupr\u00e9 2014; Nicholson and Dupre 2018;\nMeincke 2018).\n",
