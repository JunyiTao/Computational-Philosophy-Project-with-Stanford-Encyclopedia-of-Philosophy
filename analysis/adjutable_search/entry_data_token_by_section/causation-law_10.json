Indeed, the search is\nfor a unitary concept of causation that is so discriminating that it\ncan do the work that on the conventional analysis is done by both\ncause-in-fact and proximate cause doctrines. It is far from obvious\nthat causation is in fact a sufficiently discriminating relation that\nit can do this much work in assigning responsibility. Nonetheless,\nthere are three such proposals in the legal literature, each having\nsome doctrinal support in the law.\n\nOne we have seen already in the fourth variation in the counterfactual\ntest for cause in fact. If one does not ask whether the\ndefendant\u2019s act was necessary for the occurrence of the\nharm\u2014if one instead and more discriminatingly asks whether that\naspect of her act that made her negligent or otherwise\nculpable caused the harm\u2014then one has a causal test almost as\ndiscriminating as the simple counterfactual test coupled with a\nharm-within-the-risk version of the proximate cause test (Keeton 1963;\nWright 1985b). This is not surprising, because both tests rule\nineligible any aspects of the defendant\u2019s act that does\nnot make her culpable. For the aspect-causation view, such\nculpability-irrelevant aspects of the defendant\u2019s action are not\n(relevantly) the cause of the harm; for the harm-within-the-risk test,\nsuch culpability-irrelevant aspects of the defendant\u2019s action do\nnot fit the culpable mental states of the defendant. Whether one puts\nit as causation (the aspect-cause view), or as culpability (the\nharm-within-the-risk view), the discriminating power is roughly the\nsame.\n\nA second unified view of causation in the law is the oldest of these\nkinds of proposals. It conceives of causation as a metaphysical\nprimitive. Causation is not reducible to any other sort of thing or\nthings, so there is little by way of an analysis that one can\nsay about it and so very little that juries should be told about it\n(Smith 1911). The one thing we can say is that the causal relation is\na scalar relation, which is to say, a matter of degree. One thing can\nbe more of a cause of a certain event than another thing.\nGiven the scalarity of causation, all the law need do is draw the line\nfor liability somewhere on the scale marking degrees of causal\ncontribution. On matters that vary on a smooth continuum, it is\nnotoriously arbitrary to pick a precise break-point; where is the line\nbetween middle age and old age, red and pink, bald and not-bald, or\ncaused and not-caused? This approach thus picks an\nappropriately vague line below which one\u2019s causal\ncontribution to a given harm will be ignored for purposes of assessing\nresponsibility. Let the defendant be responsible and liable for some\nharm only when the degree of his causal contribution to that harm has\nreached some non de minimus, or \u201csubstantial\u201d,\nmagnitude. This is the original \u201csubstantial factor\u201d test,\nas articulated by Jeremiah Smith in 1911. To the common objection that\nthe test tells us little, its defenders reply that that is a virtue,\nnot a vice, for there is little to be said about causation. Like\nhard-core pornography, causation is something we can \u201cknow when\nwe see it\u201d (Potter Stewart\u2019s language about pornography in\nJacobellis v. Ohio), without need of general definitions and\ntests (Borgo 1979).\n\nThe third and last of these unified notions of causation is\nphysicalist in its ambitions. Some theorists have thought that we can\nsay more about the nature of the causal relation than that it is\nscalar and that a substantial amount of it is required for\nresponsibility. On this third view, the nature of causation is to be\nfound in the mechanistic concepts of physics: matter in motion,\nenergy, force (Beale 1895, 1920; Epstein 1973). This test is similar\nto the substantial factor view in its conceiving the causal relation\nto be scalar but differs in its reductionist ambitions: causation is\nnot a primitive but can be reduced to some kind of physical\nprocess.\n\nThis view handles easily the overdetermination cases that are such a\nproblem for the conventional analysis. When two fires join, two\nbullets strike simultaneously, two motorcycles scare the same horse,\neach is a cause of the harm because each is doing its physical work.\nWhen one non-mortal wound is inflicted together with a larger, mortal\nwound and the victim dies of loss of blood, each is a cause of death\nbecause each did some of the physical work (loss of blood) leading to\ndeath (People v. Lewis).\n\nSuch a mechanistic conception of causation is mostly a suggestion in\nthe legal literature because of the elusive and seemingly mysterious\nuse of \u201cenergy\u201d and \u201cforce\u201d by legal theorists\n(Hart & Honor\u00e9 1959). One suspects that some such view is\noften applied by jurors, but unless theorists can spell out the\ngeneral nature of the relation being intuitively applied by jurors,\nthis test tends to collapse to the metaphysically sparer (because\nprimitivist) substantial factor test.\n",
