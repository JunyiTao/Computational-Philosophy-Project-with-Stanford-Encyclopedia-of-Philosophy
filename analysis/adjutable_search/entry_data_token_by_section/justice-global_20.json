    "main_text": "Some Issues that Cut Across Several Themes || Authority in the Global Domain: Do We Need a World State to Secure Global Justice?\n11. The Contribution to Public Policy, Interdisciplinary Engagement, and New Methods\n\nPhilosophers are contributing in important ways to discussions of\nglobal justice policy issues. As illustrations, in this entry we have\ncanvassed several institutional reform proposals for addressing global\ninjustices which have enjoyed widespread attention, both within the\nacademy and beyond. These include Thomas Pogge\u2019s Health Impact\nFund and Nicole Hassoun\u2019s Global Health Impact proposals\n (Section 9)\n along with Pogge\u2019s proposal for a Global Resources Dividend\n (Section 10.1),\n Christian Barry and Sanjay Reddy\u2019s Just Linkage Proposal to\nhelp improve working conditions\n (Section 4),\n Allan Buchanan and Robert Keohane\u2019s institutional innovations\nto secure accountability in the use of military force\n (Section 3.2),\n and the innovative work of Leif Wenar concerning proposals for clean\ntrade\n (Section 10.1).\n\nIn addition to those illustrations already highlighted in this\narticle, philosophers are having an impact on policy discussions in a\nwide range of areas including climate change and contributing ideas to\nthe Human Development Reports (United Nations Development Programme\n2020, United Nations Development Programme 2022). They have\ncontributed to influential international multi-disciplinary projects\nthat seek alternative ways to measure quality of health, life or\npoverty (Nussbaum and Sen 1993, Esposito and Hassoun 2017, Wisor et\nal. 2014). Philosophers have also discussed rampant abusive tax\npractices by corporations and wealthy individuals and how this\ndeprives developing countries of much-needed income for human\ndevelopment in developing countries (Brock 2009). There are also\nimportant discussions of global income taxes, carbon taxes, financial\ntransaction taxes and Tobin Taxes (Moellendorf 2009; Caney 2005b;\nBrock 2009). The pervasive problems associated with corruption have\nbeen attracting increased attention (Wenar 2016; Brock 2023). So,\nphilosophers continue to make an important contribution to policy\ndebates and this is also likely to be an area in which important\nfuture work on global justice will concentrate.\n\nPhilosophers are also engaging in more interdisciplinary research and\nglobal justice theorists sometimes do experimental or more broadly\nempirical philosophy (Miller 2001; Appiah 2007; Hassoun 2009b, 2014;\nLindauer 2020; Lindauer et al. 2023; Buckland et al. 2022;\nP\u00f6lzler and Hannikainen 2022). Furthermore, there is some\nsophisticated work in related disciplines and there is significant\nroom for fruitful interdisciplinary future research (Cappelen, Fest,\nS\u00f8rensen and Tungodden 2020).\n\nPhilosophers also play central roles in methodological innovation,\nwhich can in turn play an important role in informing debates about\ntheory and public policy. As one prominent example of the\ncontributions of new global justice methodologies, it is worth noting\nthe emergence of \u201cEngaged Theorizing\u201d (see website listed\nunder internet resources), especially in the global justice context\n(Ackerly 2018; Deveaux 2015, 2021; Cabrera 2010; Lu 2017; Rafanelli\n2021; Reed-Sandoval 2020). Such approaches take lived experience,\nsocial action campaigns, and justice movements as the central\nimportant starting point for normative theorizing. Using interpretive,\nqualitative, and normative analysis, engaged political theorists try\nto align political philosophy with the questions, goals, and needs of\ncommunities seeking social justice. In these ways there have been\nimportant new attempts to bring philosophy to bear on our contemporary\nglobal realities, with significant progress made in bridging the\ndivisions between theory and practice.\n",
