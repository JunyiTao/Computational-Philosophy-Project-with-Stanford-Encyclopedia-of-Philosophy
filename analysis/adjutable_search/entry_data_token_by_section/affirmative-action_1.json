    "main_text": "The Controversy Engaged\n2. The Controversy Engaged\n\n\nThe essays by Thomson and Nagel defended the use of preferences but on\ndifferent grounds. Thomson endorsed job preferences for women and\nAfrican-Americans as a form of redress for their past exclusion\nfrom the academy and the workplace. Preferential policies, in her\nview, worked a kind of justice. Nagel, by contrast, argued that\npreferences might work a kind of social good, and without doing\nviolence to justice.  Institutions could for one or another good\nreason properly depart from standard meritocratic selection criteria\nbecause the whole system of tying economic reward to earned\ncredentials was itself indefensible.\n\n\nJustice and desert lay at the heart of subsequent arguments. Several\nwriters took to task Thomson\u2019s argument that preferential hiring\njustifiably makes up for past wrongs. Preferential hiring seen as\nredress looks perverse, they contended, since it benefits\nindividuals (African-Americans and women possessing good educational\ncredentials) least likely harmed by past wrongs while it burdens\nindividuals (younger white male applicants) least likely to be\nresponsible for past wrongs (Simon 1974, 315\u201319; Sher 1975, 162;\nSher 1979, 81\u201382; and Goldman 1976, \n190\u20131).[4]\n Instead of doing justice, contended the critics, preferential\ntreatment violated rights. What rights were at issue? The right of an\napplicant \u201cto equal consideration\u201d (Thomson 1973, 377;\nSimon 1974, 312), the right of the maximally competent to an open\nposition (Goldman 1976, 191; Goldman 1979, 24\u20138), or the right\nof everyone to equal opportunity (Gross 1977a, 382; Gross 1978,\n97). Moreover, according to the critics, preferential treatment\nconfounded desert by severing reward from a \u201cperson\u2019s character,\ntalents, choices and abilities\u201d (Simon 1979, 96), by\n\u201csubordinating merit, conduct, and character to race\u201d\n(Eastland and Bennett 1979, 144), and by disconnecting outcomes from\nactual liability and damage (Gross 1978, 125\u201342).\n\n\nDefenders of preferences were no less quick to enlist justice and\ndesert in their cause. Mary Anne Warren, for example, argued that in a\ncontext of entrenched gender discrimination, gender preferences might\nimprove the \u201coverall fairness\u201d of job selections. Justice\nand individual desert need not be violated.\n\n\nIf individual men\u2019s careers are temporarily set back because\nof\u2026[job preferences given to women], the odds are good that\nthese same men will have benefited in the past and/or will benefit in\nthe future\u2014not necessarily in the job competition, but in some\nways\u2014from sexist discrimination against women. Conversely, if\nindividual women receive apparently unearned bonuses [through\npreferential selection], it is highly likely that these same women will\nhave suffered in the past and/or will suffer in the future\nfrom\u2026sexist attitudes. (Warren 1977, 256)\n\n\n\n\nLikewise, James Rachels defended racial preferences as devices to\nneutralize unearned advantages by whites. Given the pervasiveness of\nracial discrimination, it is likely, he argued, that the superior\ncredentials offered by white applicants do not reflect their greater\neffort, desert, or even ability. Rather, the credentials reflect their\nmere luck at being born white. \u201cSome white\u2026[applicants]\nhave better qualifications\u2026only because they have not had to\ncontend with the obstacles faced by their African-American\ncompetitors\u201d (Rachels 1978, 162).  Rachels was less confident\nthan Warren that preferences worked uniformly accurate\noffsets. Reverse discrimination might do injustice to some whites; yet\nits absence would result in injustices to African-Americans who have\nbeen unfairly handicapped by their lesser advantages.\n\n\nRachels\u2019 diffidence was warranted in light of the counter-responses.\nIf racial and gender preferences for jobs (or college admissions) were\nsupposed to neutralize unfair competitive advantages, they needed to\nbe calibrated to fit the variety of backgrounds aspirants brought to\nany competition for these goods. Simply giving blanket preferences to\nAfrican-Americans or women seemed much too ham-handed an approach if\nthe point was to micro-distribute opportunities fairly (Sher 1975,\n165ff).\n",
