    "main_text": "Protagoras\u2019 Political Thought || The myth of the \u201cProtagoras\u201d\n5.1 The myth of the \u201cProtagoras\u201d\n\nThe last important testimony on Protagoras comes from the first part\nof Plato\u2019s Protagoras, where the sophist tells Socrates\nand the rest of the audience his own version of the myth of Prometheus\n(Protagoras 320c\u2013322d = 80C1 DK). In the dialogue, this myth\nis meant to defend both the Athenian democratic practice of allowing\nevery citizen to express his own ideas in public contexts and\nProtagoras\u2019 claim to teach the \u201cpolitical art\u201d. The\nmyth is told in three phases: \n\nWhen the time had come to generate mortal animals (including\nhumans), the gods entrusted Prometheus with assigning each species\nqualities that would allow it to survive and prosper. Prometheus\n(literally, \u201che who understands first\u201d, \u201cwho\nforesees\u201d) left the task up to his brother Epimetheus (\u201che\nwho understands afterwards\u201d), but the latter forgot humans.\n\nTo make up for his brother\u2019s mistake, Prometheus stole fire\nand technical expertise from the gods, allowing humans to approach the\nworld of the gods, learn how to speak, and master the technologies\nrequired to solve practical life problems\u2014the provision of food,\nclothing, and housing. However, despite this progress, humanity risked\nbecoming extinct as it lacked political wisdom, and\n\n\n\nwhen they gathered together, they committed injustice against one\nanother\u2026so that they scattered once again and were destroyed.\n(322b). \n\n Fearing that the human race would meet extinction, Zeus\ndispatched Hermes to distribute justice (dike) and shame\n(aidos), not in the same way as with the other forms of arts\n(whereby, for instance, one physician is enough for many patients),\nbut to everyone indiscriminately.\n\n\nAs Protagoras will make clear in the rest of his speech (322d\u2013328d)\nthe possession of these two virtues, which is clearly one major topic\nof the sophist\u2019s political teaching, constitutes the basis of\nthe social life.\n\nThis is not a fragment, but it is a reasonable and widely shared\nassumption that it conveys some Protagorean ideas. The problem is how\nto interpret it. There are at least two possibilities: (1) According\nto several scholars, this myth reflects Protagoras\u2019 views on the\ndevelopment of human civilisation, a highly debated topic in\nfifth-century Athens (Kahn 1981: 98). Such a reading, however, has\nseveral limitations, both if you read it literally or metaphorically.\nTaken literally, the myth is full of inconsistencies. Just to give\nsome examples: there does seem to be a pre-existing human kind, which\nis virtually defined by the possession of qualities which will be\nintroduced later; since first humans were living scattered, it is not\nclear how they developed and used the different specialised arts; if\nlanguage is distributed like the other technai, the absurd\nconclusion is that it does not belong to all human beings; the only\npossible solution to account for the passage from the second to the\nthird phase seems to depend on Zeus\u2019 direct intervention, a\nbelief which is hard to reconcile with Protagoras\u2019 agnosticism\n(see\n \u00a74).\n Taken metaphorically, as a mythical (Platonic?) reshaping of an\nhistorical account, it results in a rather banal summary of some\npopular and widespread views on human progress (Cole 1967: 51) and\ndoes not explain the overall structure of Protagoras\u2019 speech in\nits entirety. As a matter of fact, in the logos which follows\nthe myth there is no interest at all for any sort of chronological\nreconstruction. To be sure, many parallels with the dossier of texts\non the origins of human civilisation can be underlined; there is no\nneed to deny a common ground between Protagoras\u2019 myth and these\ntexts. But there is no need either to read into the myth an historical\nnarrative that either Protagoras or Plato would have reshaped into a\nmyth. (2) An alternative, and more promising, option is to take the\nmyth for what it is, that is, a myth\u2014as a story and not history\n(Farrar 1988; Sihvola 1989; Bonazzi 2011; Beresdorf 2013). It is not a\nmatter of denying that the story is clearly articulated in three\nphases, but of remarking that the myth need not be interpreted in a\nchronological sense as if it were offering a naturalistic\nreconstruction of how our civilisation developed. It is rather meant\nto account for how our society is organised and identify some\nessential features of humankind itself. When read in this way,\nanalytically and not genetically, the myth gains in clarity and\noriginality (interestingly, Plato often uses aetiological mythical\nnarratives about the origins of certain phenomena, see for instance\nBetegh 2009 on the Aesopean myth on pleasure and pain in\nPhaedo 60b\u2013c; these parallels could be tentatively used in\nfavour of the attribution to Plato of the mythological format also in\nthe case of the Protagoras). If the goal is to explain who we\nare, the myth does not need to be divided in three or five steps (as\nit is possible, of course), but rather in two parts, between the\npre-political state of nature and the political world of the city, the\nfirst envisaging an impossible world, a counterfactual example which\nshows e contrario, what is really distinctive of the human\nworld\u2014what really allows men to live the way they live: not\ntechnical skills (or the belief in the gods), but the political\nattitude, which consists in the possess of aidos and\ndike\u2014aidos corresponding to the component that\nenables each to govern himself in his conduct towards other human\nbeings and dike to the norms which regulate the social\nintercourse among human beings (Segvic 2004 [2009: 9\u201311]). In\nthis myth we find a first defence of the idea, which Aristotle will\nmake famous, that we are political animals. Human beings are political\nanimals: and political society is not so much the final accomplishment\nof mankind\u2019s long journey but the condition of possibility for\nhuman life, which is always associated life.\n",
