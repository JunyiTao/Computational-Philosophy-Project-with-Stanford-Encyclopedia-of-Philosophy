    "main_text": "Locality and Special Relativity || Bell inequalities and Einstein locality\n8.2 Bell inequalities and Einstein locality\nQuantum theory predicts correlations in the spin-singlet state that\ndo not satisfy Bell inequalities (Shimony\n2009), and by now there is ample evidence from experiments on\nthe analogous property of pairs of correlated photons that quantum\ntheory is correct, and therefore one or more of the assumptions that\ngo into the derivation of a Bell inequality must be faulty. While the\nclaim has been made that the key assumption is locality, and therefore\na violation of Bell inequalities implies that the real (quantum) world\nis nonlocal, a histories analysis identifies the problem as a\ndifferent assumption made by Bell: the existence of classical hidden\nvariables that are inconsistent with Hilbert space quantum\nmechanics. For more details see the \n Further Reading supplement.\n\n\nIn addition, the histories approach makes it possible to establish\non the basis of quantum mechanics itself a principle of Einstein\nlocality (Griffiths 2011b):\n\nObjectively real internal properties of an isolated individual\nsystem do not change when something is done to another non-interacting\nsystem.\n\nThis statement is to be understood in the following way. Let\n\\(\\HC_S\\) be the Hilbert spaces of an isolated individual system \\(S\\),\n\\(\\HC_R\\) that of the rest of the world, so \\(\\HC=\\HC_S\\otimes\\HC_R\\) is\nthe Hilbert space of the total system. The properties of \\(S\\) must be\nrepresented by a projective decomposition of \\(\\HC_S\\), or by a\nconsistent family of such properties. That \\(S\\) is isolated means there\nis no interaction between \\(S\\) and \\(R\\), which is to say that for any\ntwo times \\(t\\) and \\(t'\\) during the period of interest the time\ndevelopment operator of the total system factors:\n\\[T(t',t)=T_S(t',t)\\otimes T_R(t',t).  \\label{eqn42}\\]\nSomething done to another system might be, for example, the choice\nbetween measuring \\(S_{bx}\\) and \\(S_{bz}\\) for a particle \\(b\\) which is\npart of \\(R\\), with the measuring apparatus and whatever makes the\nmeasurement choice, e.g., a quantum\ncoin (Sec. 19.2 of Griffiths 2002a) that\nis also part of \\(R\\).\n",
