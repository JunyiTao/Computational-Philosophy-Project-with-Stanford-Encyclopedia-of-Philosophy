    "main_text": "Individual essences and bare identities || Responses to the problems\n4.4 Responses to the problems\n\nThe fact that, in the absence of non-trivial individual essences, a\ntransworld identity characterization of de re modal\nstatements appears to generate bare identities (via arguments such as\nChisholm\u2019s Paradox or Forbes\u2019s reduplication argument) may\nproduce a variety of reactions.\n\nThe moral that Chisholm (1967) drew from his argument was scepticism\nabout transworld identity, based partly on scepticism about whether\nthe non-trivial individual essences that would block the generation of\nrole-switching worlds are available. Others would go further, and\nconclude that such puzzles provide not only a reason for rejecting\ntransworld identity, but also a reason for adopting counterpart\ntheory. (Note, though, that Lewis\u2019s reasons for adopting\ncounterpart theory appear to be largely independent of such puzzles\n(cf. Lewis 1986, Ch. 4).)\n\nA third reaction is to accept bare identities\u2014or, at\nleast, to accept that individuals (including actual individuals) may\nhave qualitative duplicates in other possible worlds, and that\ntransworld identities may involve what have been called\n\u2018haecceitistic\u2019 differences. (See Adams 1979; Mackie 2006,\nChs 2\u20133; Lewis 1986, Ch. 4, Section 4; also the separate entry\non Haecceitism.)\n\nA fourth reaction, that of Forbes, is to propose a mixed solution: he\nholds that for some individuals (including human beings and trees)\nsuitable candidates for non-trivial individual essences can be found\n(by appeal to distinctive features of their origins), although for\nothers (including most artefacts) it may be that no suitable\ncandidates are available, in which case counterpart theory should be\nadopted for these cases (see Forbes 1985, Chs 6\u20137).\n\nKoslicki (2020) provides another mixed solution. She accepts\n(primarily for Quinean reasons) that there is a problem of transworld\nidentity for certain individuals including people: one that can be\nsolved only by attributing to them non-trivial individual essences;\nshe argues that these consist in their individual forms. Such an\nindividual form would provide a substantial answer to questions such\nas \u2018what makes an individual Noah in the \u201crole-switching\u201d world rather\nthan Adam?\u2019 Thus, it would appear, the problem of transworld identity\nfor individuals such as Noah and Adam is replaced by a problem of\ntransworld identity for their individual forms. But why is this\nsupposed to represent an improvement? As Fine puts it: \u2018Why should we\nnot simply take the crossworld identity of [non-form] entities as\ngiven and not standing in any need of a criterion?\u2019 (2020, 430). One\nreason (considered by Koslicki) is conceptual. It is thought that we\nneed to make sense of de re modal claims in terms of de\ndicto modal claims. However, if individual forms are to come to\nthe rescue, the question arises how the individual forms are to be\ndistinguished from one another. The problem is acute in cases where\nthe individuals in question are otherwise indiscernible (Fine 2020,\n432). Moreover, it is not clear that Koslicki\u2019s invocation of the fact\nthat individual forms\u2014unlike, say, unanalysable haecceities\u2014have\na \u2018qualitative\u2019 element (2020, Sections 3.3.4\u20133.5) is supposed to help\nwith this problem.\n\nIt is perhaps significant, though, that no theorist appears to have\nargued that a \u2018non-trivial individual essence\u2019 solution\ncan be applied to all the relevant cases. In other words, the\nconsensus appears to be that the price of interpreting all\nde re modal claims in terms of transworld identity (as\nopposed to counterpart theory) is the acceptance of (some) bare\nidentities across possible worlds.\n\nSalmon (1996) claims \u2018something like a proof\u2019 of this\nimplication, from transworld identities to bare identities. He argues\nfor what he calls Extreme Haecceitism, the view that\ntransworld identities cannot be grounded in general facts about the\nindividuals concerned. The purported proof goes as follows. We\nconsider x in world w and y in world\nw2 and suppose, for reductio, that x = y\nand that this fact is reducible to (or grounded in, or entailed by)\ngeneral facts about x in w and y in\nw2. But, says Salmon, the fact that x = x is not\nreducible (grounded, etc.) in this way, since it is a fact of logic.\nSo, says Salmon, \u2018x differs from y in at least\none respect. For x lacks y\u2019s feature that its\nidentity with x is grounded in general (cross-world) facts\nabout x and it\u2019 (1996, 216), and hence (by\nLeibniz\u2019s Law), x \u2260 y, contrary to assumption. So if\nthere are any transworld identities, those identities cannot be\ngrounded in general facts about those individuals. They must be\n\u2018bare\u2019.\n\nSalmon\u2019s argument is a variant on Evans\u2019s (1978) argument\nagainst the possibility of vague objects. It is controversial in\ngeneral whether arguments of this form succeed, for applications of\nLeibniz\u2019s Law in intensional contexts are questionable.\nCatterson (2008) argues on independent grounds that Salmon\u2019s\nargument is not sound. We should also note that, even if the argument\nis successful, it does not directly establish Salmon\u2019s Extreme\nHaecceitism, but only the conditional thesis that if there\nare any true transworld identity statements x = y, then they\nare not reducible to general facts about x and\ny.\n",
