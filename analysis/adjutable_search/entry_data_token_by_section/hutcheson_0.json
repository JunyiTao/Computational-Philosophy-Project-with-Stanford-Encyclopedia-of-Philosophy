    "main_text": "Hutcheson\u2019s Metaethics\n1. Hutcheson\u2019s Metaethics\n\nHutcheson\u2019s most detailed statement of his sentimentalism and\nsubstantive moral and aesthetic theory is to be found in his 1725 (and\nsubsequently revised) work, An Inquiry into the Original of our\nIdeas of Beauty and Virtue. Indeed, at least in early editions of\nthe Inquiry, Hutcheson considered this essay an attempt to\ndefend the (broadly considered) sentimentalist doctrines of Lord\nShaftesbury, as expressed in the Characteristiks of Men, Manners,\nOpinions, Times (1711). Indeed, the subtitle of the book\u2019s\nfirst edition runs as follows: \n\n\nIn which the principles of the late Earl of Shaftesbury are\nExplain\u2019d and Defended, against the Author of the Fable of\nthe Bees: and the Ideas of Moral Good and Evil are\nestablish\u2019d, according to the Sentiments of the Antient\nMoralists. With an Attempt to introduce a Mathematical Calculation in\nSubjects of Morality. (Inquiry)\n\n\nThe reference to Mandeville is significant here. In the\nInquiry, Hutcheson considered it his task to defend, not the\nexact details of Shaftesbury\u2019s scheme, but rather his general\nsentimentalism against the \u201cself-interest\u201d theories of\nMandeville and Thomas Hobbes. But leaving aside his rejection of\nself-interest theorists for the moment (see\n \u00a72.1),\n what is the nature of Hutcheson\u2019s overall metaethic?\n",
