    "main_text": "Paradox || The Russell-Myhill Paradox\n4.5 The Russell-Myhill Paradox\n\nIn a later paper, Church turns his attention to a paradox that Russell\nformulates in Appendix B of Principles of Mathematics (1903).\nOnce again, Church\u2019s aim is first to show how this contradiction\narises in STT, and then to appeal to RTT as a means of solving the\nproblem. This time, however, STT is not supplemented directly by any\novert semantic principles concerning denotation or predication, but\nonly by a predicate for identity of propositions and axioms supporting\nRussell\u2019s view as of 1903, that if a pair of propositions differ\nby a constituent, then they are different propositions. For example,\nif \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are distinct classes of propositions, then the\npropositions expressed by \u201cEvery proposition in \\(X\\) is\ntrue\u201d differs from that expressed by \u201cEvery proposition in\n\\(Y\\) is true\u201d. Given this principle\u2014call it\n\u201cStructure\u201d\u2014if such propositions are correlated with\nthe classes they mention, then it is possible to diagonalize and\nobtain a contradiction. For let \\(W\\) be the class of propositions\nthat are not in the classes with which they are correlated, and\nconsider the proposition expressed by \u201cEvery proposition in\n\\(W\\) is true\u201d. Then this proposition is in \\(W\\) if and only if\nit\u2019s not. (Note that this argument involves yet another\nviolation of\n CL,\n since in effect it defines a function \\(f\\) from propositions to sets\nof them, and then assumes that \\(D_f\\) is in the range of \\(f\\). )\nChurch gives a careful proof theoretical analysis of this argument\nshowing exactly what formal principles must be assumed for it to be\nformally derivable. (See\n supplement F\n for a sketch of some details.)\n\nIn a certain form, this contradiction actually rose up to bite Church\nhimself, because Myhill (1958) was able to derive a version of it\nwithin Church\u2019s initial formulation of LSD. Thus it has come to\nbe called \u201cthe Russell-Myhill paradox (RM)\u201d. In fact, RM\ncan be deployed to prove the inconsistency of popular accounts of\npropositions such as that of Soames (1987, 2010; see Deutsch 2008,\n2014, 2019). Recently, however, higher order versions of RM have\nenjoyed attention from philosophers seeking to draw metaphysical\nmorals (Goodman 2017; Uzquiano 2015). These writers see the\ncontradiction as a proof that Russell\u2019s Structure principle is\nfalse. But neither Russell nor Church saw it that way. Russell left\nthe problem open and Church turned to RTT for a resolution.\n4.6 The Knowability Paradox\n\nIn the course of writing a referee\u2019s report on a paper submitted\nto the Journal of Symbolic Logic by Frederick Fitch, Church\ngives the following inspired argument:\n\nThen it may plausibly be maintained that if \\(a\\) is not omniscient,\nthere is always a true proposition which it is empirically impossible\nfor \\(a\\) to know at time \\(t\\). For let \\(k\\) be a true proposition\nwhich is unknown to \\(a\\) at time \\(t\\), and let \\(k'\\) be the\nproposition that \\(k\\) is true but unknown to \\(a\\) at time \\(t\\).\nThen \\(k'\\) is true. But it would seem that if \\(a\\) knows \\(k'\\) at\ntime \\(t\\), then \\(a\\) must know \\(k\\) at time \\(t\\), and must also\nknow that he does not know \\(k\\) at time \\(t\\) \u2026 this is a\ncontradiction. (1945b [Salerno (ed.) 2009: 14])\n\n\nIt follows that it is impossible for \\(a\\) to know \\(k'\\) at time\n\\(t\\). A generalization of this argument appears to show that if there\nare true propositions that are not known to be true, then there are\ntrue propositions that cannot be known\u2014that are unknowable.\nContrapositively, if every true proposition can be known, then every\ntrue proposition is known\u2014which is clearly absurd.\n\nThe generalization\u2014which Church does not formulate and which was\nfirst formulated by Fitch (1963)\u2014has become known as \u201cThe\nKnowability Paradox\u201d or \u201cFitch\u2019s Paradox\u201d and\nit has been the subject of a great deal of wide-ranging commentary\ncollected in Salerno\u2019s (2009). Fitch\u2019s argument may be\nformulated as follows:\n\nAssume for reductio that \\(K(p \\hdot \\neg Kp)\\).\nThen \\(Kp \\hdot K\\neg Kp\\), assuming \\(K(q \\hdot r)\\) implies \\(Kq\n\\hdot Kr\\), for arbitrary \\(q\\) and \\(r\\).\n\\(\\neg Kp\\), assuming \\(Kq\\) implies \\(q\\), for arbitrary\n\\(q\\).\nHence, \\(Kp \\hdot \\neg Kp\\) by logic.\nTherefore, \\(K(p \\hdot \\neg Kp)\\) cannot possibly be true, and\ntherefore, \\(p \\hdot \\neg Kp\\) is unknowable.\n\n\nFitch, in his (1963), does not state the argument 1\u20145, but\ninstead notes that the proof of his generalized conclusion is\n\u201csimilar\u201d to Church\u2019s argument. Surprisingly, Church\ndoes not comment on the incompatibility of a Fitch-style\ngeneralization with the logical positivist doctrine that any\nmeaningful and true proposition is in principle verifiable and hence\nknowable. The contemporary revival of Fitch\u2019s argument, however,\nis almost entirely devoted to this issue and, more generally, to the\nconsequences of Fitch\u2019s argument for widely held views committed\nto the principle that there are no unknowable truths.\n\nChurch remarks in effect that step 2, the distribution of \\(K\\) over a\nconjunction, is an instance of the doubtful principle that the logical\nconsequences of a known proposition are also known. He also notes that\nthere are \u201cfools\u201d who would believe a conjunction and yet\nnot believe its conjuncts. But could there be such foolishness as to\ncount a conjunction as known and yet not count its conjuncts\nas such? Most find this highly implausible. Finally, Church suggests\nthat his argument runs afoul of type restrictions. Linsky, in his\n(2009), gives a lucid account of the application of Church\u2019s\n1976 version of RTT to the knowability paradox. See also the entry on\nFitch\u2019s Paradox of Knowability.\n5. Foundations of Mathematics\n\nChurch was primarily concerned with providing a foundational system\nthat meets two basic conditions: (1) it avoids the paradoxes, and (2)\nit is adequate for extant mathematics. These two conditions will be\nthe main focus of this section.\n5.1 Attempts at Type-Free Foundations\n\nLater in his career, Church looked to RTT to meet conditions (1) and\n(2); but in his early forays into foundations he was quite dismissive\nof RTT:\n\n\nRather than adopt the method of Russell for avoiding the paradoxes of\nmathematical logic, or that of Zermelo, both of which appear somewhat\nartificial, we introduce for this purpose, as we have said, a certain\nrestriction on the law of excluded middle. (1932 [BE: 52])\n\n\nIt turned out that despite this restriction a form of Russell\u2019s\nparadox is derivable in the system of 1932. Nevertheless, it was here\nthat Church first formulated the (untyped) \u03bb-calculus as a mere\npart of the whole system. This part turned out to be of great\nimportance for the theory of computation, formal semantics and for the\nfoundations of mathematics in general. So much for inconsistency! (See\n supplement D\n for a description of the \u03bb-calculus).\n\nIn the second paper (Church 1933), the problem about Russell\u2019s\nparadox was corrected. But Kleene and Rosser (1935) established that\nboth systems\u2014those of Church 1932 and 1933\u2014as well as\nrelated early systems of combinatory logic fell prey to\nRichard\u2019s paradox. The mere part\u2014the pure untyped\n\u03bb-calculus\u2014is, however, consistent in the sense that not\nall equations between \u03bb terms are derivable. This follows from\nan early result due to Church himself and Rosser (1936)\u2014the\nChurch-Rosser theorem (see the entry on the\n lambda calculus\n for discussion). Significant mathematical models for the\n\u03bb-calculus were developed later (Scott and Strachey 1971;\nPlotkin 1993; see Hindley & Seldin 2008: ch. 16). Church also\nproved the consistency of a variant of the system of (1933) by\nelementary means (1934), thus escaping, as he hoped, the\nincompleteness theorems of G\u00f6del (1931). But this system was too\nweak to satisfy requirement (2), and Church abandoned the system. (A\ntype-free system with a similar motivation was proposed later by\nMyhill 1975.) It is remarkable that in his failed struggle to produce\na consistent, type-free foundational system, Church nevertheless\nintroduced ideas that have profoundly affected the development of\nlogic.\n5.2 Type-theoretic vs. Set-theoretic Foundations\n\nIn 1940 Church turned away from a type-free approach and published a\nversion of STT that incorporated \u03bb-abstraction (see\n supplement D).\n Although Church had developed what became the most useful and famous\nversion of STT (1940), he thought that it was not enough to meet\ncondition (1), since he thought that STT when augmented with a\nsemantical predicate was vulnerable to the semantical paradoxes such\nas the Epimenides and Grelling\u2019s paradox (cf.\n section 4\n above). To avoid these he thought it necessary to appeal to RTT (with\nreducibility).\n\nRegarding condition (2), STT with axioms of infinity and choice\npermits the full development of classical number theory and analysis.\nChurch (1959 [BE: 493]) notes that STT with an axiom of infinity and\nZermelo set theory (Z) are of \u201ccomparable\u201d provability\nstrength but that Z is slightly stronger. (Indeed, the first detailed\nproof that Z is stronger than STT with infinity is given in a thesis\nwritten under Church\u2019s supervision by Kemeny (1949). It is now\nknown that STT with an axiom of infinity is equi-consistent with and\nhas as much provability strength as bounded Zermelo set\ntheory (see Farmer 2008 and the citations therein). Moreover,\nChurch\u2019s STT has turned out to be an important tool in the\ninvestigation of automated reasoning and proof verification in\ncomputer science. The typed system with \u03bb is particularly well\nsuited for the use and development of programming languages and\nparadigms (such as Haskell and Functional Programming [Hudak 1989]).\nThus, Church succeeded in providing a type theoretical alternative to\nset theory as a foundation for mathematics. (It\u2019s also worth\nmentioning that through his work on finite automata, Church\ncontributed in yet another fundamental way to computer science [1960,\n1962a].)\n\nHowever, for the most part, at this point, Church focused on the\ndevelopment of intensional logic in the form of LSD (see\n \u00a73)\n and on condition (1)\u2014viz. the problem of semantical\nparadox. In his 1976, his aim is clearly to communicate the resolution\nvia RTT of the semantical paradoxes:\n\n\nTo avoid impredicativity the essential restriction is that\nquantification over any domain (type) must not be allowed to add new\nmembers to the domain, as it is held that adding new members changes\nthe meaning of quantification over the domain in such a way that a\nvicious circle results. (1976 [BE: 794]).\n\n\nGiven the rest of 1976, it is natural to view Church as defending\nRussell\u2019s diagnosis of the paradoxes. (This contrasts with\nChurch\u2019s early view that RTT embodies an \u201cad hoc\u201d\nresolution; see the quotes at the beginning of this section.)\nChurch\u2019s final position seems to have been, then, that both RTT\nand Russell\u2019s rationale for it are correct.\n\nAs for the axioms of reducibility, Church\u2019s view was that the\naxioms only reinstate impredicativity for extensional notions and that\nintensional notions remain unaffected: \u201cThus the\nrejection of impredicative definition is annulled in extensional but\nnot in intensional matters\u201d. In this way, RTT with the axioms of\nreducibility permits the full development of classical number theory\nand analysis and blocks the semantical paradoxes. This is a view\nshared by Kripke (2011b) and Myhill (1979).\n\nChurch\u2019s published remarks on set theory are scattered,\nrelatively brief and stop short of full endorsement. However, his\noverall attitude towards set theory was accepting and conciliatory,\nalthough he was skeptical of some of its axioms, including separation\nand choice. His doctoral dissertation (under Veblen) was on\n\u201cAlternatives to Zermelo\u2019s Assumption\u201d\n(1927)\u2014namely, the axiom of choice. He viewed Zermelo\u2019s\naxiomatization of set theory as \u201ctransferring\u201d the\nconcepts of class and class membership from the \u201c(unformalized)\nlogical level\u201d to the \u201c(formalized) mathematical\nlevel\u201d, but viewed the improvements due to von Neumann, Fraenkel\nand Skolem as bringing it continually closer to (formalized) logic, so\nthat\n\n\nit is now possible to formulate the theory as a system of symbolic\nlogic in the same sense as the system of Principia. (1939b\n[BE: 156])\n\n\nThese improvements brought with them an emphasis on formalization\n(such as Skolem\u2019s isolation of first order logic) and that was\nfor Church a sign that logic was being done; although he no doubt\nmodified his view as the distinction between logic and proper theory\nbecame pronounced. Later on, Church himself contributed again to set\ntheory. His paper on set theory with a universal set shows great\ningenuity in the analysis of a route to a consistent set theory\n(consistent relative to ZF) with a universal set (1974c). But he did\nnot think that set theory could handle intensional notions, despite\nthe success of set theoretic model theory for modal logic. For a\ntreatment of intensional notions he continued to look to RTT.\n5.3 Logicism and Intuitionism\n\nChurch (1962b) distinguished sharply between which systems provide\nfoundations for \u201cthe whole of presently extant\nmathematics\u201d and which ones provide \u201can economical\nbasis\u201d for particular branches such as arithmetic.\nChurch\u2019s view was that while the study of logicism had led to\nthe discovery of type theory and so to the discovery of adequate\nfoundations for the whole of extant mathematics (see\n \u00a75.2),\n it did not succeed in putting arithmetic on the most\neconomical basis possible (for reasons explained, in\n supplement D\n on TT). Moreover:\n\n\nA more satisfactorily economical basis for elementary arithmetic is\nprovided either by one of the standard formulations of first-order\narithmetic employing primitive notations special to arithmetic and\nspecial arithmetic postulates, or by a weak set theory which is\nadequate for the treatments of finite sets but omits all the standard\nset-theoretic axioms that are not needed for this purpose (including\nthe axiom of infinity). (1962b [BE: 611])\n\n\nFor example, elementary arithmetic can be represented in the universe\nof hereditarily finite sets (HF), without the axiom of infinity (for\ndiscussion and history see C. Parsons 1987, 2007).\n\nAs for intuitionism, early on Church rejected Brouwer\u2019s view\nthat in mathematics the truth of a proposition is identical with the\npossibility of proving the proposition, because\n\n\nit seems more in accord with our usual ideas to think of truth as a\nproperty of a proposition independent of our ability to prove it.\n(1928a [BE: 44])\n\n\nBut he welcomed Heyting\u2019s formalization of intuitionism as\nproviding needed clarification. Later in a discussion of\nintuitionistic objections to logicism, he pointed out that\nHeyting\u2019s work was a concession to the method of logistic\ncharacteristic of logic, and hence in tension with Brouwer\u2019s\nview that mathematics is prior to logic (1962b [BE: 611]). The point\nis a powerful one. Even those seeking to replace, for example,\nKripke\u2019s proof within classical logic of the completeness of\nintuitionistic propositional calculus, with an intuitionistically\nacceptable argument, have had to use the logistic method in their\ninvestigation.\n5.4. The Significance of G\u00f6del\u2019s Theorems and the Continuum Problem\n\nChurch was acutely conscious of the effect on the question of\nfoundations of G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness theorems. His early\nattitude was that they were \u201cunpleasant\u201d results to be\ncircumvented, if at all possible (1934). His work in this direction is\nrelated to Alan Turing\u2019s work on \u201cordinal logics\u201d in\nhis Princeton doctoral thesis completed under Church\u2019s direction\n(see Turing\u2019s [1939] paper and Feferman [1995]). Turing\u2019s\nidea, encouraged by Church, was to extend an incomplete system by\nadding to it the sentences unprovable in it and iterating this\noperation into the transfinite. However, the iteration must be\neffective and involve only ordinals that are constructive in the sense\ndefined and studied earlier by Church (1938) and Kleene (1938). This\nidea is still being investigated today.\n\nChurch also noted that while the pure \u03bb-calculus escapes\nG\u00f6del\u2019s first incompleteness theorem, this is only in\nvirtue of its lack of provability strength, and so:\n\n\nThe sense in which it escapes the G\u00f6del theorem is not\nsignificant from the point of view of logic as a foundation of\nmathematics. (1984 [BE: 829])\n\n\nOn the other hand, he also noted that for any sufficiently strong\nformalized language, such as STT with the axiom of infinity,\n\n\nno proof of consistency\u2026 is known, except by methods involving\nassumptions so strong as to destroy any major significance. (1959 [BE:\n488])\n\n\nMoreover, he was aware that the incompleteness theorems are a price\nthat has to be paid for communicating and verifying proofs in a\nsufficiently strong formalized language that also meets his\nrequirement of effectiveness (discussed in\n \u00a72).\n The theorems, their significance for Hilbert\u2019s program, their\nrelation to effectiveness, and their relation to Tarski\u2019s work\nare discussed in some detail in chapter VIII of Church\u2019s\ntextbook on mathematical logic (1968/1972/1976; printed in BE). Here\nChurch also acknowledged the value of Gentzen\u2019s and\nG\u00f6del\u2019s consistency proofs, but apparently did not think\ntheir significance was \u201cmajor\u201d. A finitary consistency\nproof in the sense of Hilbert was desirable but impossible.\n\nElsewhere, Church comments that:\n\n\nThe feeling that there is an absolute realm of sets, somehow\ndetermined in spite of the non-existence of a complete axiomatic\ncharacterization, receives more of a blow from the solution (better,\nthe unsolving) of the continuum problem than from the famous\nG\u00f6del incompleteness theorems. It is not a question of\nrealism\u2026 versus either conceptualism or nominalism, but if one\nchooses realism, whether there can be a \u201cgenetic\u201d realism\nwithout axiomatic specification. (1966 [BE: 677]).\n\n\nWhile Church may have wished to postulate an absolute realm of sets,\njust as he postulated such a realm of senses, in neither case was he\nhappy to affirm the existence of such entities without first\nformulating an axiomatic theory of them and then evaluating it for\ntruth (see\n section 6).\n The independence from the axioms of ZFC of a natural set-theoretic\nquestion like that of the cardinality of the continuum showed that\nChurch\u2019s strictures could not be met without the discovery of\nanother axiom. Absent this discovery, Church hesitated to postulate an\nabsolute realm of sets and even noted the possibility of set-theoretic\nrelativism: that there could be \u201crival set theories\u201d and\nthat sets \u201chave their reality only relative to and within a\ncertain theory\u201d (1966 [BE: 677]).\n6. Metaphysics\n6.1 Metaphysics and the Logistic Method\n\nChurch\u2019s mature view was that discussion of metaphysical\ndoctrines is only worthwhile if they can be reformulated and developed\nusing the logistic method. For example, he thought that the question\nof the legitimacy of the distinction between form and matter should be\ninvestigated by setting up a formal language, which is used to isolate\nthe form of a proposition as well as of the corresponding sentence, so\nthat one can reinterpret its non-logical vocabulary and study what is\ncommon under various reinterpretations: \u201cthis may be considered\na more precise formulation of the traditional distinction between form\nand matter\u201d (1956a [BE: 372\u20133 and 379]; 1956\u201372 [BE:\n697]; 1959 [BE: 415, 475]).\n\nAnother question that receives such a reformulation is that of the\nexistence of abstract entities, which, according to Church, are\n\u201cpostulated\u201d as ontological commitments of a true sentence\nor theory that has been developed in accordance with the strictures of\nthe logistic method. The basic idea is that theory \\(T\\) is\nontologically committed to entities of kind \\(K\\) if the truth of\n\\(T\\) implies that there are \\(K\\)s (1958a). Moreover, as Church\nclarified later, \u201ctheory\u201d was intended to encompass not\nonly formal theories but also\n\n\nsystems of notions which arose long before scientific method came to\nbe consciously used and which have therefore become embedded matters\nof \u201ccommon sense\u201d in the natural languages (1951b, fn.\nAdded 1971 [BE: 287]).\n\n\nThis would suggest that numbers were postulated when notations for\nthem first entered human culture\u2014long before the advent of\nmodern science and the discovery of the logistic method. (For an\nexample of how natural numbers have become embedded in natural\nlanguage, see the discussion of \u201cdescendant\u201d in\n supplement D.)\n Presumably, however, according to the logistic method, such notations\nmust ultimately be included in a formalized object language to which\nthe criterion of ontological commitment is then applied. Further,\ngiven this commitment:\n\n\nIf [the philosopher] maintains, for example, that numbers do not exist\nbut nevertheless asserts, or is persuaded to admit, \u201c1729 is the\nsum of two cubes in more than one way\u201d, he is, at least\nprima facie, involved in contradiction, because by naming the\nnumber 1729 and attributing a property to it he seems to be committed\nto the existence of at least this one number. (1958a [BE: 438])\n\n\nMore generally,\n\n\nthose philosophers who speak of \u201cexistence\u201d,\n\u201creality\u201d, and the like are to be understood as meaning\nthe existential quantifier, and are to be condemned as inconsistent if\non this basis inconsistency appears in their writings. The\njustification is that no other reasonable meaning of\n\u201cexistence\u201d has ever been provided (which would fit into\ncontexts of the kind that were quoted), and the burden of providing\nsuch a second meaning of \u201cexistence\u201d rests on those whose\nwritings or whose philosophical views require it. (1958a [BE:\n442]).\n\n\nRecently, Jody Azzouni (2004, 2010) has attempted to shoulder this\nburden. For discussion of nominalism and Church\u2019s criterion see\nChurch (1958a,b), Burgess (2001) as well as Salm\u00f3n (2020).\n6.2 Church\u2019s Modest Realism\n\nChurch was at pains to distinguish his preferred brand of realism from\nPlatonism (1973a [BE: 748]). Moreover, he was also clear that his\nrealism was not\n\n\neven the extreme realism of Frege and G\u00f6del, but rather only in\nopposition to the claim of superior reality for physical or\nspatio-temporal entities. (1951b, fn. Added 1971 [BE: 287])\n\n\nTo show the contrast with Frege, Church stated that while his own view\nis that the two truth values are \u201cpostulated\u201d:\n\n\nTo Frege, as a thoroughgoing Platonic realist, our use of the word\n\u201cpostulate\u201d here would not be acceptable. (1956a:\n\u00a74)\n\n\nFrege\u2019s position, according to Church, is that \u201cthere\nare two such things as truth and falsehood\u201d (1956a:\n\u00a74). Of course, it also follows from Church\u2019s semantic\ntheory together with his criterion of ontological commitment that\nthere are two such things as truth and falsehood. What, then,\nis the disagreement with Frege? It appears to be that because Church\npostulated the two truth values relative to a logistic theory, and\nbecause he did not claim to have demonstrated conclusively the truth\nof one such theory, he still saw room for consideration of competing\nlogistic theories, and so competing ontologies, which do not postulate\ntruth values as objects (cf. 1966).\n\nNevertheless, according to Church, theories that are effectively\nspecifiable (cf. 2.3) can be communicated, inspected, compared with\neach other and with observational data\u2014as well as evaluated for\ntruth by other rational, checkable procedures. So there is no\nprincipled reason (other than Church\u2019s Theorem) why,\nafter rational debate has come to an end, we could not assert the\ntruth of our theory and postulate the existence of its ontological\ncommitments with near certainty. (Of course, in some cases the theory\nmay be underdetermined by the data; and in the case of set theory\nthere may be genuine theory relativity; cf.\n \u00a75.4.)\n\nReturning to Church\u2019s \u201copposition to the claim of superior\nreality for physical or spatio-temporal entities\u201d, his reason\nwas that spatio-temporal entities are, like abstract entities,\npostulated ontological commitments of theories. For this reason,\nterminology for spatio-temporal entities does not\n\u201cbelong to the vocabulary in which the observational data are\nstated;\u201d rather they are theoretical constructs the terminology\nfor which \u201cbelongs to a theoretical language\u201d (1951b, fn.\nAdded 1971 [BE: 287]; cf. 1975 [BE: 983\u20134].)\n\nComplementary to Church\u2019s \u201copposition to the claim of\nsuperior reality for spatio-temporal entities\u201d was his view that\nabstract entities\u2014assuming they exist\u2014are no more remote\nfrom causal explanations than are spatio-temporal ones. To Carnap, who\nclaimed that abstracts entities may be avoided in causal explanations\nof phenomena (1963), Church responded by claiming\n\n\nthe cause of an event is never a physical object or even another event\nbut a total situation, in the description of which many entities, both\nabstract and concrete, must in general be mentioned (1951b, fn. Added\n1971 [BE: 287]).\n\n\nMoreover, Church added that if we assume that the objects of\nlinguistic understanding and (other) propositional attitudes are\npropositions (cf.\n \u00a73.3\n and\n \u00a76.3),\n then propositions are also an essential part of any adequate causal\nexplanation of behavior.\n\nGiven all this, it is not surprising that Church did not see a\nspecial problem about our epistemological access to concepts\nand propositions:\n\n\nBut the preference of (say) seeing over understanding as a method of\nobservation seems to me capricious. For just as an opaque body may be\nseen, so a concept may be understood or grasped. And the parallel\nbetween the two cases is indeed rather close. In both cases the\nobservation is not direct but through intermediaries\u2014light, lens\nof eye or optical instrument, and retina in the case of visible body,\nlinguistic expressions in the case of the concept. And in both cases\nthere are or may be tenable theories according to which the entity in\nquestion, opaque body or concept, is not assumed, but only those\nthings which would otherwise be called its effects. (1951b [BE:\n287])\n\n\nIt should be emphasized that Church\u2019s realism about propositions\nis not supposed to follow from their role in causal explanations but\nfrom his view that no logistic theory that is both true and humanly\nunderstandable can do without them. It is to this that we now\nturn.\n6.3 Realism about Propositions\n\nThe notion of proposition that Church argued must be\npostulated by semantics is the \u201cabstract notion\u201d:\n\n\nindependent alike of any particular expression in words and of any\nparticular psychological act of judgment or conception\u2014not the\nparticular declarative sentence, but the content or meaning which is\ncommon to the sentence and its translation into another\nlanguage\u2014not the particular judgment, but the objective content\nof the judgment, which is capable of being the common property of\nmany. (1956\u201372 [BE: 742])\n\n\nChurch credited Leibniz with an important argument that goes some way\nto establishing the need for this notion in semantics. The argument,\nas reported by Church (1956b), is as follows:\n\nTruth cannot attach to actual particular thoughts\n(cogitationes) or particular acts of judgment, since what is\nthought or judged by no one may nevertheless be true. Perhaps, then,\ntruth attaches to things (res) rather than particular\nthoughts. However, falsehood cannot attach to things, only to\nthoughts. In which case, if truth attaches to things and falsehood\nattaches to thoughts, then we cannot say that the same subject might\nbe true or false. Leibniz\u2019s way out, as reported by Church, is\nthat truth and falsehood attach to possible thoughts. This is\nthe notion that Church considered an important step towards the\nabstract notion of a proposition.\n\nChurch (1956b) noted that instead of making the final step from\npossible thoughts to propositions, we might claim that truth and\nfalsehood attach to possible sentences of some\nlanguage\u2014those that the syntactical rules of the language allow\nas well formed. He added that this move won\u2019t serve the\nnominalist like Goodman\u2014who denies propositions because they are\nabstract\u2014since the move also invokes abstract types. Further,\nand for the reasons discussed in\n \u00a73.3,\n if we abandon nominalism but continue to limit our ontology to\npossible sentences, then our semantic theory will provide a false\nanalysis of attributions of assertion and belief.\n\nChurch (1956b) also considered rejecting the first line of argument\nand insisting that truth and falsehood do attach only to\nactual particular thoughts or sentences. In that case, he argued, we\nwould be limited to those things that we could actually think or say\nin a reasonable amount of time. In which case, there would no longer\nbe a distinction between statements that are unproved because of human\nlimitations and those that are unprovable as a matter of\nmathematical necessity.\n\nMoreover, Church pointed out that those who are willing to accept\nthese limitations must, at the very best, face an excessively\ncomplicated theory of syntax and semantics (one that, for example,\nwould have to be formulated without the notion of an infinite\nsequence):\n\n\nIndeed the justification would seem to be basically the same for\nextended physical objects in macrophysical theory and for ideal\nsentences in logical syntax: both are postulated entities\u2014some\nmay prefer to say inferred entities\u2014without which the theory\nwould be intolerably complex if not impossible. (1956b [BE:\n359\u201360])\n\n\nReturning to Leibniz\u2019s dialogue, Church pointed out that it\ncontained an important assumption about logical form (which Church\naccepted): that there is some thing\u2014whether a thought\nor another kind of thing\u2014that is the logical subject of\nattributions of truth and falsehood as well as the logical object of\nattributions of assertion and belief, including attributions\ncontaining bound variables such as \u201cthere is something that\nChurch asserts and Goodman denies\u201d. Church was scathingly\ncritical of those (like Goodman) who denied this assumption without\nalso providing, in sufficient detail, their own corresponding analyses\nof attributions of assertion and belief. Church (1956b; 1973) noted\nthat Scheffler (1954) was almost alone in offering such an analysis\nand defended the assumption by submitting Scheffler\u2019s proposal\nto extensive criticism. Especially puzzling to Church was\nScheffler\u2019s willingness to admit that there is a philosophical\nproblem about the existence of physical objects while also insisting,\nwithout argument, that there is a problem about the existence of\npropositions and sentence types that is different in kind.\n\nIn sum, Church\u2019s argument for the existence of propositions is\nas follows. (1) Actual thought or sentence tokens, as well as possible\nsentences, are insufficient for semantics to be a true and humanly\nunderstandable theory. Rather, (2) propositions are also needed.\nFurther, by Church\u2019s criterion of ontological commitment, (3) if\nentities of kind \\(K\\) are entailed by a true theory, then there exist\nentities of kind \\(K\\). So, (4) there exist propositions. Church\n(1952, 1958a) chides Ayer and Ryle for not taking this last step, that\nis for inadvertently committing themselves to propositions while\ntalking about propositional attitudes but denying their existence\nwhile talking explicitly about propositions as theoretical\ncommitments.\n\nRegarding the second premise, it remains to be shown that we need to\ntake the step from the notion of a possible\nthought\u2014which is abstracted from the notion of a possible\nmind that is capable of error and so of thinking something\nfalse\u2014to the notion of an abstract proposition. Church\nattributed the discovery of the latter notion to both Bolzano and\nFrege (Church 1943a; 1956a,b). However, Church did not endorse\nBolzano\u2019s arguments so much as his conclusion. (For the\nargument, see\n \u00a73.3 of the entry on Bolzano.)\n And as for Frege, Church simply reiterated his remarks about the\nobjectivity, mind and language independence, and publicity of\nGedanke, without telling us exactly why possible thoughts are\nnot also objective, mind-and-language-independent, abstract and\npublic. Perhaps the issue is that the existence of possible thoughts\ndepends on the existence of possible minds, whereas propositions, such\nas that two and two are four, do not depend on the existence\nof possible minds, since, intuitively, they would be true if there\nwere no minds at all. Arguably, then, the notion of an abstract\nproposition must be postulated by and so is an ontological commitment\nof a theory that can explain the foregoing intuition.",
