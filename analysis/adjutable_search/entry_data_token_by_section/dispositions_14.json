    "main_text": "The Intrinsicness of Dispositions\n6. The Causal Efficacy of Dispositions\n\nSome philosophers have said that dispositions\nare not causes of, or causally explanatory of,\ntheir manifestations. Why? Their thought can be encapsulated by\nMoli\u00e8re famous quip, in Le Malade Imaginaire,\nthat a philosopher might explain why opium puts people to sleep by\nmentioning the fact that it has a \u2018dormitive virtue\u2019. The\npoint, of course, is that this is no explanation or, if it is, it is\nnot a good explanation. To have a dormitive virtue, it seems, is just\nto have a property that puts people to sleep, and that fact tells us\nonly a little, if anything, about why substances\nwith that property put people to sleep. In general, \\(x\\)\u2019s\npossession of a disposition \\(D\\)\nconceptually necessitates \\(x\\)\u2019s manifesting\n\\(D\\) under a suitable condition, and conceptual necessitation is\nnot a kind of causal or explanatory connection. This is what McKitrick\n(2004, 2005) names the \u2018analyticity argument\u2019 for the\ncausal inefficacy of dispositions. Arguments of this kind have been\nbrought forth by Mackie (1973, 1977), Armstrong (1968), Block (1990),\nand Jackson (1995, 1996).\n\nThere is another type of argument. Prior et al. (1982) argue that the\ncausal inefficacy of dispositions is a consequence of the Causal\nThesis and the Distinctness Thesis combined (see\n section 4\n above):\n\n\nBy the Causal Thesis, any disposition (and thus fragility) must have a\ncausal basis. This causal basis is a sufficient causal explanation of\nthe breaking as far as the properties of the object are\nconcerned. But then there is nothing left for any other\nproperties of the object to do. By the Distinctness Thesis the\ndisposition is one of these other properties, ergo\nthe disposition does nothing. (p. 255)\n\n\nThis argument is akin to \u2018exclusion arguments\u2019 advanced\nby, for instance, Block (1990) and Kim (1990, 1998) to deny the causal\nefficacy of mental properties. See Yablo 1992 for an objection to the\nexclusion argument, to the effect that a mental event is \u2018better\nqualified than its physical basis for the role of cause\u2019 (p.\n279).\n\nPrior et al. point out that their argument assumes that a disposition\ncannot be an overdetermining cause of its manifestation,\nmore generally, that no event can have two \u2018operative\u2019\nsufficient conditions (see also Jackson 1998, p. 202).\nSince, ex hypothesi, it is the causal basis for the\ndisposition that is the operative sufficient\ncondition for its manifestation, the disposition itself, even though\nits possession is sufficient in the circumstances for the\nmanifestation, is an inoperative sufficient condition,\nand so is not a cause. Schaffer (2003), however, argues that cases of\noverdetermining causes in Prior et al.\u2019s sense are not just possible\nbut, as a matter of fact, routine. In his view, they must be modeled\nafter ubiquitous cases of quantitative overdetermination where\n\u2018the cause is decomposable into distinct and independently\nsufficient parts\u2019: when one big round rock hits a window, it has\ntwo hemispheres that quantitatively overdetermine the breaking of the\nwindow. If Schaffer is right, then Prior et al.\u2019s argument for the\ncausal inefficacy of dispositions is defused. (See Rives 2005 for a\ndifferent formulation of the argument that doesn\u2019t assume that a\ndisposition cannot be an overdetermining cause of\nits manifestation.)\n\nWe have surveyed two salient arguments for the causal inefficacy of\ndispositions. Note that they, to be successful, would have to be\naccompanied by an account of what causal efficacy is,\nand the large literature on causal efficacy attests to the difficulty\nof complying with this demand. McKitrick (2005) surveys several of the\nexisting accounts of causal efficacy\u2014or, in her terms, causal\nrelevance\u2014and argues that the most plausible of these give us no\nclear reason for thinking that dispositions are causally irrelevant to\ntheir manifestations.\n",
