    "main_text": "Structure and Sources of ER || Sources\n4.2 Sources\n\n\nThe \u201ctrue philosophy\u201d that Ibn Daud expounds is the form\nof Aristotelianism, which was articulated by the Muslim philosophers\nAlfarabi and especially Ibn Sina. Ibn Daud refers to Alfarabi\u2019s\ncommentary on Aristotle\u2019s Topics and seems to have been\nfamiliar with his commentary on the Categories as well. In\ngeneral, Ibn Daud was influenced by Alfarabi\u2019s thought as\npresented in as-Siy\u00e2s\u00e2t\nal-madaniyya (The Political Regime). Even more important for Ibn\nDaud\u2019s system was Ibn Sina\u2019s thought. Many of the\ndemonstrations in the ER are based on works by this author,\nin particular his encyclopedic works Kit\u00e2b\nal-Shif\u00e2\u2019 and Kit\u00e2b\nan-Naj\u00e2t. Most influential was Ibn Sina\u2019s psychology,\nas well as his views of the Necessary Being, cosmology and the origin of\nevil.  Ibn Daud also drew on the work of the critic of these\nphilosophers, al-Ghazali (1058-1111) who summarized their teachings in\nMaq\u00e2sid al-Fal\u00e2sifa (The Intentions of the\nPhilosophers). It is most probable that Ibn Daud\u2019s book reflects\nal-Najat in its purpose, organization, and language.  Another source\nof inspiration was the Muslim theologian and polemist Ibn Hazm, whose\nanti-Jewish polemic inspired Ibn Daud\u2019s Biblical exegesis. As\nfor his Jewish predecessors, Ibn Daud built on\nSaadya\u2019s Emunot and was certainly familiar with Judah\nHalevi, although he does not explicitly mention him by name\n(cf. section 5.7 below).  Occasionally, one also comes across views\nthat he shares with Bahya ibn Paquda, Ibn Zaddiq, or Abraham ibn\nEzra.\n",
