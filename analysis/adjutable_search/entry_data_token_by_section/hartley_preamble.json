    "main_text": "\n\nDavid Hartley (1705\u201357) is the author of Observations on\nMan, his Frame, his Duty, and his Expectations (1749)\u2014a\nwide-ranging synthesis of neurology, moral psychology, and\nspirituality (i.e., our \u201cframe,\u201d \u201cduty,\u201d and\n\u201cexpectations\u201d). The Observations gained\ndedicated advocates in Britain, America, and Continental Europe, who\nappreciated it both for its science and its spirituality. As science,\nthe work grounds consciousness in neuro-physiology, mind in brain. On\nthis basis, the central concept of \u201cassociation,\u201d much\ndiscussed by other British philosophers and psychologists, receives\ndistinctive treatment: the term first names the physiological process\nthat generates \u201cideas,\u201d and then the psychological\nprocesses by which perceptions, thoughts, and emotions either link and\nfuse or break apart. In keeping with this physiological approach,\nHartley offers a conceptually novel account of how we learn and\nperform skilled actions, a dimension of human nature often left\nunexplored in works of philosophy. Such actions include those involved\nin speech\u2014and, by extension, the conduct of scientific inquiry.\nAs a work on the spiritual condition of humanity, Hartley\u2019s\nObservations affirms universal salvation\u2014the assurance\nthat all people will eventually become \u201cpartakers of the divine\nnature.\u201d In this regard, it presents an original model of\npsychological growth, which describes how the self both forms and\ntransforms, as the person gains in \u201csympathy\u201d and\n\u201ctheopathy\u201d\u2014put simply, learns to love, both others\nand God.\n\nThe son of an Anglican clergyman, David Hartley was born in June 1705\nin the vicinity of Halifax, Yorkshire. His mother died three months\nafter his birth, and his father when David was fifteen. After\nreceiving his B.A. and M.A. from Jesus College, Cambridge, Hartley\npracticed medicine in Bury St. Edmunds (1730\u201335), London\n(1735\u201342), and Bath, where he died on 28 August 1757. He married\ntwice: in 1730, Alice Rowley, who died in 1731 giving birth to their\nson David (1731\u20131813); and in 1735, Elizabeth Packer\n(1713\u201378), despite the opposition of her very wealthy family.\nThe couple had two children, Mary (1736\u20131803) and Wincombe Henry\n(1740\u201394). Although severely afflicted with bladder stones,\nHartley lived a full and active life: he practiced medicine, engaged\nin mathematical research, sought a cure for \u201cthe stone,\u201d\ndevoted himself to intellectual and philanthropic projects, and wrote\nthe Observations on Man.\n",
