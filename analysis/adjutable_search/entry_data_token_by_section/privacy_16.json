    "main_text": "Contemporary Debates || Group Privacy\n4.5 Group Privacy\n\nGroup privacy has entered philosophical discussion at a rather late\nstage, since it was only with the new forms of information and\ncommunication technology that groups could be targeted and surveilled\nefficiently. Research on group privacy addresses the fact that it is\nnot individuals that are targeted by data collection and profiling\npractices, but rather groups of individuals who share certain relevant\nfeatures. An important and influential collection of essays is that of\nTaylor, Floridi, and van der Sloot (2017a). Taylor et al. point out\nthat\n\n\nprofiling and machine learning technologies are directed at the group\nlevel and are used to formulate types, not tokens\u2014they work to\nscale, and enable their users to target the collective as much as the\nindividual. (2017b: 1)\n\n\nThe book discusses divergent perspectives on what a group is, how\ngroups should be addressed with regard to privacy, which elements of\nthe problem can be addressed using current legal and conceptual tools,\nand which will require new approaches.\n\nEspecially interesting is Floridi\u2019s argument that\n\n\ngroups are neither discovered nor invented but designed by the level\nof abstraction (LoA) at which a specific analysis of a social system\nis developed. Their design is therefore justified insofar as the\npurpose, guiding the choice of the LoA, is justified. (Floridi 2017:\n83)\n\n\nFloridi states that the claims that groups have rights and groups have\nprivacy are taken together in the argument that groups can have rights\nto privacy, and that indeed sometimes it is only the group which has\nprivacy and not its members. (2017: 83; see also Taylor 2017:\n13\u201336; van der Sloot 2017: 197\u2013224). Loi and Christen\n(2020) agree with Floridi\u2019s claim that groups can have rights to\nprivacy. However, they argue, against Floridi, for the distinction\nbetween two different concepts of privacy for groups:\n\n\nThe first (\u2026) deals with confidential information shared with\nthe member of a group and inaccessible to (all or a specific group of)\noutsiders. The second (\u2026) deals with the inferences that can be\nmade about a group of people defined by a feature, or combination\nthereof, shared by all individuals in the group. (Loi & Christen\n2020: 207)\n\n\nLoi and Christensen claim that it is the latter, the inferential\nnotion of privacy which is the one explaining group privacy. An\nabsolute right to this privacy, they conclude, is implausible.\n\nPuri (2021) criticizes the conventional liberal conception of privacy\nthat focuses excessively on the identification of the individual as\ninadequate in safeguarding the individual\u2019s identity and\nautonomy. Puri therefore develops\n\n\na theoretical framework in the form of a triumvirate model of the\ngroup right to privacy (GRP), which is based on privacy as a social\nvalue\u2026 [he also formulates] the concept of mutual or companion\nprivacy, which counterintuitively states that in the age of Big Data\nAnalytics, we have more privacy together rather than individually.\n(Puri 2021: 477)\n\n",
