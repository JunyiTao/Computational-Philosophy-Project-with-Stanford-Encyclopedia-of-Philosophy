    "main_text": "The Concept of Autonomy || Conceptual Variations\n1.2 Conceptual Variations\n\nThe variety of contexts in which the concept of autonomy functions has\nsuggested to many that there are simply a number of different\nconceptions, and that the word simply refers to different elements in\neach of those contexts (Arpaly 2004). Others have claimed that while\nthere may be a single over-arching concept of autonomy, we should\nthink in terms of separable dimensions of it rather than an all or\nnothing idea (Mackenzei 2014 and Killmister 2017). Feinberg has\nclaimed that there are at least four different meanings of\n\u201cautonomy\u201d in moral and political philosophy: the capacity\nto govern oneself, the actual condition of self-government, a personal\nideal, and a set of rights expressive of one\u2019s sovereignty over\noneself (Feinberg 1989). One might argue that central to all of these\nuses is a conception of the person able to act, reflect, and choose on\nthe basis of factors that are somehow her own (authentic in some\nsense). Nevertheless, it is clear that formulating a\n\u201ctheory\u201d of the concept will involve more than merely\nuncovering the obscure details of the idea\u2019s essence, for\nautonomy, like many concepts central to contentious moral or political\ndebate is itself essentially contested. So a theory of autonomy is\nsimply a conceptual model aimed at capturing the general sense of\n\u201cself-rule\u201d or \u201cself-government\u201d (ideas which\nobviously admit of their own vagaries) and which can be used to\nsupport principles or policies the theory attempts to justify.\n\nThe idea of self-rule contains two components: the independence of\none\u2019s deliberation and choice from manipulation by others, and\nthe capacity to rule oneself (see Dworkin 1989, 61f and Arneson 1991).\nHowever, the ability to rule oneself will lie at the core of the\nconcept, since a full account of that capability will surely entail\nthe freedom from external manipulation characteristic of independence.\nIndeed, it could be claimed that independence per se has no\nfixed meaning or necessary connection with self-government unless we\nknow what kinds of independence is required for self-rule (cf.,\nhowever Raz 1986, 373\u201378). \n\nFocusing, then, on the requirements of self rule, it can be claimed\nthat to govern oneself one must be in a position to act competently\nbased on desires (values, conditions, etc.) that are in some sense\none\u2019s own. This picks out the two families of conditions often\nproffered in conceptions of autonomy: competency conditions and\nauthenticity conditions. Competency includes various capacities for\nrational thought, self-control, and freedom from debilitating\npathologies, systematic self-deception, and so on. (Different accounts\ninclude different conditions: see, for example, Berofsky 1995, R.\nYoung 1991, Haworth 1986, Meyers 1989.)\n\nAuthenticity conditions often include the capacity to reflect upon and\nendorse (or identify with) one\u2019s desires, values, and so on. The\nmost influential models of authenticity in this vein claim that\nautonomy requires second-order identification with first order\ndesires. For Frankfurt, for instance, such second-order desires must\nactually have the structure of a volition: wanting that the first\norder desires issue in action, that they comprise one\u2019s will.\nMoreover, such identification, on his view, must be\n\u201cwholehearted\u201d for the resulting action to count as free\n (autonomous).[1]\n\nThis overall approach to autonomy has been very influential, and\nseveral writers have developed variations of it and defended it\nagainst objections. The most prominent objections concern, on the one\nhand, the fatal ambiguities of the concept of\n\u201cidentification\u201d and, on the other, the threat of an\ninfinite regress of conditions. The first problem surrounds the\ndifferent ways that one can be said to \u201cidentify\u201d with a\ndesire, each of which render the view conceptually suspect. Either one\nidentifies with an aspect of oneself in the sense of simply\nacknowledging it (without judgment) or one identifies with a desire in\nan aspirational, approving sense of that term. In the first case,\nhowever, identification would clearly not be a consistent mark of\nautonomy, for one could easily identify as part of oneself any manner\nof addictive, constricting, or imposed aspects of one\u2019s make-up.\nBut approving of a trait is also problematic as a requirement of\nautonomy, for there are many perfectly authentic aspects of myself\n(ones for which I can and should be held fully responsible for\nexample) which I do not fully approve of. I\u2019m not perfect, but\ndoes that mean that I am thereby not autonomous? (Cf. Watson 1989,\nBerofsky 1995,\n 99\u2013102).[2]\n\n\nThis model stresses internal self-reflection and procedural\nindependence. However, the view includes no stipulations about the\ncontent of the desires, values, and so on, in virtue of which one is\nconsidered autonomous, specifically there is no requirement that one\nact from desires independently of others. Were there to be such a\nrequirement, it would involve what is called \u201csubstantive\nindependence\u201d. Some writers have insisted that the autonomous\nperson must enjoy substantive independence as well as procedural\nindependence (e.g., Stoljar 2000, Benson 1987, 2005, Oshana 2006). The\nmotivation for such a position is the idea a person under constrained\nlife situations should not be considered autonomous no matter how\n\u201cvoluntary\u201d (or autonomous) was the choice that put her in\nthat position (cf. Meyers 2000). This claim, however, threatens to rob\nthe attribution of autonomy of any claim to value neutrality it may\notherwise carry, for if, conceptually, one is not autonomous when one\n(freely, rationally, without manipulation) chooses to enter conditions\nof severely limited choice, then the concept is reserved to only those\nlifestyles and value pursuits that are seen as acceptable from a\nparticular political or theoretical point of view. I will return to\nthis line of thought in a moment. In rejoinder, it has been claimed\nthat such procedural neutrality could not capture the value autonomy\nhas for people, and moreover, a \u201cweakly substantive\u201d view\ncan be compatible with a political form of liberalism as long as the\nvalues inherent in the concept could be accepted by reasonable persons\nin an overlapping consensus (see Freyenhagen 2017). \n\nOne variation on the internal self-reflection model focuses on the\nimportance of the personal history of the agent as an element of her\nautonomy (Christman 1991, Mele 1993; cf. Fisher & Ravizza 1998;\ncf. also Raz 1986, 371). On these views, the question of whether a\nperson is autonomous at a time depends on the processes by which she\ncame to be the way she is. It is not clear that such a focus will be\nable to avoid the problems raised about internal reflection models\n(see Mele 1991, Mackenzie & Stoljar 2000b, 16\u201317), but such\na move attempts to embrace a conception of the self of self-government\nwhich is not only social but diachronically structured (see, e.g.,\nCuypers 2001).\n\nFor those who are wary of the postulate of reflective self\nendorsement, an alternative approach is to equate autonomy with simply\na set of competences, such as the capacity to choose deliberatively,\nrationally, and, as Berofsky claims, \u201cobjectively\u201d (see\nBerofsky 1995, Meyers 1989). This locates autonomy in the general\ncapacity to respond to reasons, and not, for example, in acts of\ninternal self-identification. However, even in these accounts, the\ncapacity to think critically and reflectively is necessary for\nautonomy as one of the competences in question, even though the\nreflective thought required need not refer to external values or\nideals (Berofsky 1995, ch. 5).\n\nFurther difficulties have been raised with the requirement of second\norder self-appraisal for autonomy. For it is unclear that such higher\nlevel judgments have any greater claim to authenticity than their\nfirst order cousins. Clearly if a person is manipulated or oppressed\n(and hence non-autonomous), it could well be that the reflective\njudgments she makes about herself are just as tainted by that\noppression as are her ground-level decisions (Thalberg 1989, Friedman\n1986, Meyers 1989, 25\u201341, Noggle 2005), and often our second\norder reflective voices are merely rationalizations and acts of\nself-deception rather than true and settled aspects of our character\n(for general discussion see the essays in Veltman and Piper 2014).\nThis has led to the charge that models of autonomy which demand\nsecond-order endorsement merely introduce an infinite regress: for\nsecond-level judgments must be tested for their authenticity in the\nsame way as first order desires are, but if that is so, then ever\nhigher levels of endorsement would be called for. Various responses to\nthis problem have been made, for the most part involving the addition\nof conditions concerning the manner in which such reflection must be\nmade, for example that it must be free of certain distorting factors\nitself, it must reflect an adequate causal history, and the like\n(Christman 1991, Mele 1995).\n\nOther aspects of the inner reflection model should be noted. As just\nmentioned, this view of autonomy is often stated as requiring critical\nself reflection (see, e.g., Haworth 1986). This has been understood as\ninvolving a rational appraisal of one\u2019s desires, testing them\nfor internal consistency, their relation to reliable beliefs, and the\nlike. But an overly narrow concentration on rational\nassessment exposes such conceptions to charges of hyper\nintellectualism, painting a picture of the autonomous person as a\ncold, detached calculator (see Meyers 2004, 111\u201337). Connections\nto values, desires, and personal traits are often grounded in\nemotional and affective responses, ones connected with care,\ncommitment, and relations to others (see Friedman 1998, MacKenzie\n& Stoljar 2000b, Meyers 1989, de Calleja, Mirja Perez 2019). For\nparallel reasons, some theorists have noted that concentration on only\ndesires as the focal point of autonomy is overly narrow, as\npeople can (fail to) exhibit self-government relative to a wide range\nof personal characteristics, such as values, physical traits,\nrelations to others, and so on (see Double 1992, 66). \n",
