    "main_text": "Problem III: Exclusion || Necessary Effects: A Deeper Problem for Functionalism?\n6.6 Necessary Effects: A Deeper Problem for Functionalism?\n\nFunctionalism, along with any non-reductive theory of mind, faces the\nproblem just discussed. But even if exclusionary worries are finessed,\nfunctionalism faces an additional and possibly more fundamental\nproblem.\n\nAs we noted earlier, functionalism characterizes states of mind\ncausally. To be in a given mental state is to be in a state with the\nright sort of causal profile, a state bearing the right sorts of\nrelation to other states. Think of functional states as nodes in a\nnetwork of states, the identity of which depends on the relations they\nbear to other nodes, and think of the realizers as occupants of these\nnodes. All there is to a node is the potential causal relations it\nbears to other nodes (not so for the occupants, which have intrinsic\nproperties). Suppose, then, that F and G are\nfunctional properties\u2014nodes in this network\u2014and that all\nthere is to something\u2019s being F is its being a\nG-causer. The resulting generalization, \u201cFs\ncause Gs\u201d, is no doubt true, but it is vacuous,\nequivalent to the generalization that G-causers cause\nGs.\n\nThis appears to strip functional properties of their causal efficacy.\nWhy? One line of thought appeals to Hume\u2019s celebrated doctrine\nthat there can be no necessary connections between distinct\nexistences. A mental property and its would-be effect are distinct,\nyet functionalism entails that they enjoy a necessary connection. On\nthe Humean doctrine, such a connection could not be causal. Another,\nclosely related, version of the problem requires that causal relations\nbe subsumed by empirical laws. But there are no such laws available\nfor functional properties if all of the relevant generalizations are\nanalytic and vacuous. (The foregoing argument in either version\nthreatens to generalize to all dispositional properties: see\n  dispositions,\n \u00a76. For the problem aimed at functionalism in particular, see\nBlock 1990; Rupert 2006;\n functionalism,\n \u00a75.2.)\n\nThis argument echoes the logical connection argument advanced\nin the 1950\u2019s and 60\u2019s against causal accounts of action\n(e.g., Melden 1961, pp. 52\u20133). Given that reasons (desires,\nintentions) are not logically distinct from the actions they\nrationalize, reasons could not cause actions. In response, Davidson\n(1963) noted that logical connections hold among predicates or\ndescriptions of events, not among events themselves. A cause could be\ndescribed in various ways, some of which will involve the effect:\nconsider \u201cthe cause of the fire caused the fire\u201d. This is\nhardly informative, but it\u2019s not thereby false. And of course\nthe statement, far from precluding a causal relation, explicitly\nasserts it. That said, if the claim is true, it should be possible to\nidentify the cause of the fire independently of reference to the\neffect\u2014as \u201cthe match\u2019s igniting\u201d, for\ninstance. In defense of his own causal theory of action, Davidson\nargued that such a re-description of mental causes is always\navailable, at least in principle (see \u00a75.1).\n\nBut Davidson\u2019s saving move appears not to be available for the\nfunctionalist, for in the case of functional states and properties, no\nsuch independent descriptions are available, as the nature of a\nfunctional property is exhausted by its place in the causal\nnetwork.\n\nThe functionalist has a number of options available, some of them\nmirroring solutions to the Exclusion Problem (Rupert 2006 provides a\ncritical survey). For example, a functionalist could settle for a\nweaker, explanatory role for functional properties, leaving causal\nefficacy to the realizers of functional states (\u00a76.4; see, e.g.,\nSegal 2009; compare Roth and Cummins 2014). Or a functionalist might\nidentify states of mind with their realizers (\u00a76.5); indeed, some\nof the early functionalists were identity theorists (Lewis 1966, 1994;\nArmstrong 1968/1993). This would permit the sort of re-description\nthat the more mainstream version of functionalism apparently blocks. A\nthird option is to look for non-vacuous, empirical generalizations\nsubsuming functional properties (Antony and Levine 1997). Yet a fourth\noption rejects the Humean doctrine, permitting necessary connections\nbetween a causally efficacious property and its effect. Such a\nproposal would find a home in the more general \u201ccausal theory of\nproperties\u201d defended by Shoemaker (1980, 1998) and others.\n",
