    "main_text": "Philosophy and Revelation\n5. Philosophy and Revelation\n\nIn describing the \u201ctheological-political predicament\u201d\nStrauss continually returns to the questions of the epistemological\nand political status of revelation vis-\u00e0-vis philosophy. He\ncriticizes the modern critique of religion beginning in the\n17th century for advancing the idea that revelation and\nphilosophy should answer to the same scientific criteria, maintaining\nthat this notion brings meaningful talk of revelation to an end,\neither in the form of banishing revelation from conversation or in the\nform of so-called modern defenses of religion which only internalize\nthis banishment. Strauss\u2019s early musings on the\ntheologico-political predicament led him to a theme upon which he\nwould insist again and again: the irreconcilability of revelation and\nphilosophy (or the irreconcilability of what he would call elsewhere\nJerusalem and Athens or the Bible and Greek philosophy). Strauss\nmaintains that because belief in revelation by definition does not\nclaim to be self-evident knowledge, philosophy can neither refute nor\nconfirm revelation:\n\nThe genuine refutation of orthodoxy would require the proof that the\nworld and human life are perfectly intelligible without the assumption\nof a mysterious God; it would require at least the success of the\nphilosophical system: man has to show himself theoretically and\npractically as the master of the world and the master of his life; the\nmerely given must be replaced by the world created by man\ntheoretically and practically (SCR, p. 29).\n\n\nBecause a completed system is not possible, or at least not yet\npossible, modern philosophy, despite its self-understanding to the\ncontrary, has not refuted the possibility of revelation.\n\nOn Strauss\u2019s reading, the Enlightenment\u2019s so-called\ncritique of religion ultimately also brought with it, unbeknownst to\nits proponents, modern rationalism\u2019s self-destruction. Strauss\ndoes not reject modern science, but he does object to the\nphilosophical conclusion that \u201cscientific knowledge is the\nhighest form of knowledge\u201d because this \u201cimplies a\ndepreciation of pre-scientific knowledge.\u201d As he put it,\n\u201cScience is the successful part of modern philosophy or science,\nand philosophy is the unsuccessful part\u2014the rump\u201d (JPCM,\np. 99). Strauss reads the history of modern philosophy as beginning\nwith the elevation of all knowledge to science, or theory, and as\nconcluding with the devaluation of all knowledge to history, or\npractice. In Strauss\u2019s words: \u201cthe root of all modern\ndarkness from the seventeenth century on is the obscuring of the\ndifference between theory and praxis, an obscuring that first leads to\na reduction of praxis to theory (this is the meaning of so-called\n[modern] rationalism) and then, in retaliation, to the rejection of\ntheory in the name of praxis that is no longer intelligible as\npraxis\u201d (FPP, p. 66). Whereas in the seventeenth-century,\nHobbes, like Spinoza after him, depreciates pre-scientific knowledge\nin the name of science, Heidegger, in the twentieth-century,\ndepreciates scientific knowledge in the name of historicity. While\nmany philosophers (including Heidegger) have understood\nHeidegger\u2019s philosophy as breaking with modern rationalism,\nStrauss views Heidegger\u2019s philosophy as a logical outcome of\nthat same rationalism. According to Strauss, modern rationalism\nimplodes upon itself: what starts as a modern quest for delineating\nscientific standards in the name of certain knowledge leads to the\nconclusion that there are neither such standards nor such truths.\n\nStrauss argues that just as modern philosophy begins with an\nover-inflated sense of reason that privileges theory over practice and\nends with a radical historicism that denies any meaning to reason\noutside of history, so too, modern political philosophy\nbegins with the attempt to make the human being part of nature as\ndefined by science and ends by denying any notion of nature all\ntogether. For Strauss, these trajectories come together in the\ncoincidence of Heidegger\u2019s philosophy and his political\nmisadventures:\n\nThe crucial issue concerns the status of those permanent\ncharacteristics of humanity, such as the distinction between the noble\nand the base\u2026. It was the contempt for these permanencies which\npermitted the most radical historicist in 1933 to submit to, or rather\nto welcome, as a dispensation of fate, the verdict of the least wise\nand least moderate part of his nation\u2026 The biggest event of\n1933 would rather seem to have proved, if such proof was necessary,\nthat man cannot abandon the question of the good society\u2026.\n(WPP, pp. 26\u201327).\n\n\nStrauss does not mean to imply that National Socialism was inevitable.\nRather he means to investigate why there was no adequate rational,\nmoral response to the rise of National Socialism. It is here that\nthe modern crises of philosophy and theology meet in the modern crisis\nof politics. Neither modern political philosophy nor theology nor\nphilosophy had the critical resources to respond to the disintegration\nof the liberal state, the very political structure that was touted as\n\u201cthe opposite of\u2026 \u2018the kingdom of darkness,\u2019\ni.e., of medieval society\u201d (SCR, p. 3).\n\nIt would become the mature Strauss\u2019s task to consider how\nphilosophy, theology, and political philosophy could each once again\nhave the critical resources to make the most basic distinction between\nthe noble and the base. To do so, Strauss would have to overcome what\nhe called the \u201cpowerful prejudice, that a return to pre-modern\nphilosophy is impossible\u201d (SCR, p. 31).\n",
