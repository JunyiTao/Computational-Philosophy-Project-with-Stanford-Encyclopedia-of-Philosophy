    "main_text": "Democratic Representation || What Sort of Representative System is Best?\n5.1 What Sort of Representative System is Best?\n\nA number of debates have centered on the question of what kinds of\nrepresentative systems are best for a democratic society. What choice\nwe make here will depend heavily on our underlying moral justification\nof democracy, our conception of citizenship as well as on our\nempirical understanding of political institutions and how they\nfunction. The most basic types of formal political representation\navailable are single member district representation, proportional\nrepresentation and group representation. In addition, many societies\nhave opted for multicameral legislative institutions. In some cases,\ncombinations of the above forms have been tried.\n\nSingle member district representation returns single representatives\nof geographically defined areas containing roughly equal populations\nto the legislature and is prominent in the United States, the United\nKingdom, and India, among other places. The most common form of\nproportional representation is party list proportional representation.\nIn a simple form of such a scheme, a number of parties compete for\nelection to a legislature that is not divided into geographical\ndistricts. Parties acquire seats in the legislature as a proportion of\nthe total number of votes they receive in the voting population as a\nwhole. Group representation occurs when the society is divided into\nnon-geographically defined groups such as ethnic or linguistic groups\nor even functional groups such as workers, farmers and capitalists and\nreturns representatives to a legislature from each of them.\n\nMany have argued in favor of single member district legislation on the\ngrounds that it has appeared to them to lead to more stable government\nthan other forms of representation. The thought is that proportional\nrepresentation tends to fragment the citizenry into opposing\nhomogeneous camps that rigidly adhere to their party lines and that\nare continually vying for control over the government. Since there are\nmany parties and they are unwilling to compromise with each other,\ngovernments formed from coalitions of parties tend to fall apart\nrather quickly. The post war experience of governments in Italy\nappears to confirm this hypothesis. Single member district\nrepresentation, in contrast, is said to enhance the stability of\ngovernments by virtue of its favoring a two party system of\ngovernment. Each election cycle then determines which party is to stay\nin power for some length of time.\n\nCharles Beitz argues that single member district representation\nencourages moderation in party programs offered for citizens to\nconsider (Beitz 1989: ch. 7). This results from the tendency of this\nkind of representation towards two party systems. In a two party\nsystem with majority rule, it is argued, each party must appeal to the\nmedian voter in the political spectrum. Hence, they must moderate\ntheir programs to appeal to the median voter. Furthermore, they\nencourage compromise among groups since they must try to appeal to a\nlot of other groups in order to become part of one of the two leading\nparties. These tendencies encourage moderation and compromise in\ncitizens to the extent that political parties, and interest groups,\nhold these qualities up as necessary to functioning well in a\ndemocracy.\n\nIn criticism, advocates of proportional and group representation have\nargued that single member district representation tends to muffle the\nvoices and ignore the interests of minority groups in the society\n(Mill 1861; Christiano 1996). Minority interests and views tend to be\narticulated in background negotiations and in ways that muffle their\ndistinctiveness. Furthermore, representatives of minority interests\nand views often have a difficult time getting elected at all in single\nmember district systems so it has been charged that minority views and\ninterests are often systematically underrepresented. Sometimes these\nproblems are dealt with by redrawing the boundaries of districts in a\nway that ensures greater minority representation. The efforts are\ninvariably quite controversial since there is considerable\ndisagreement about the criteria for apportionment.\n\nIn proportional representation, by contrast, representatives of\ndifferent groups are seated in the legislature in proportion to\ncitizens\u2019 choices. Minorities need not make their demands\nconform to the basic dichotomy of views and interests that\ncharacterize single member district systems so their views are more\narticulated and distinctive as well as better represented.\n\nAdvocates of group representation, like Iris Marion Young, have argued\nthat some historically disenfranchised groups may still not do very\nwell under proportional representation (Young 1990: ch. 6). They may\nnot be able to organize and articulate their views as easily as other\ngroups. Also, minority groups can still be systematically defeated in\nthe legislature and their interests may be consistently set back even\nif they do have some representation. For these groups, some have\nargued that the only way to protect their interests is legally to\nensure that they have adequate and even disproportionate\nrepresentation.\n\nOne worry about group representation is that it tends to freeze some\naspects of the agenda that might be better left to the choice of\ncitizens. For instance, consider a population that is divided into\nlinguistic groups for a long time. And suppose that only some citizens\ncontinue to think of linguistic conflict as important. In the\ncircumstances a group representation scheme may tend to be biased in\nan arbitrary way that favors the views or interests of those who do\nthink of linguistic conflict as important.\n",
