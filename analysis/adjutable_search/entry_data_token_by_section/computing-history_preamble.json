    "main_text": "\n\n\nHistorically, computers were human clerks who calculated in accordance\nwith effective methods. These human computers did the sorts of\ncalculation nowadays carried out by electronic computers, and many\nthousands of them were employed in commerce, government, and research\nestablishments. The term computing machine, used increasingly\nfrom the 1920s, refers to any machine that does the work of a human\ncomputer, i.e., any machine that calculates in accordance with\neffective methods. During the late 1940s and early 1950s, with the\nadvent of electronic computing machines, the phrase \u2018computing\nmachine\u2019 gradually gave way simply to \u2018computer\u2019,\ninitially usually with the prefix \u2018electronic\u2019 or\n\u2018digital\u2019. This entry surveys the history of these\nmachines. \n\n",
