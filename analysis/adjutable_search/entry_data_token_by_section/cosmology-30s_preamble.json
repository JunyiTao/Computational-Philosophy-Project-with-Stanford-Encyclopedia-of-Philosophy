    "main_text": "\n\nSometimes, philosophy drives science. Cosmology between 1932\u201348\nprovides an excellent example how explicitly philosophical\nconsiderations directed the evolution of a modern science during a\ncrucial period of its development. The following article exhibits\nthese philosophical aspects of cosmological thinking in detail,\nbeginning with a brief sketch of the historical development of general\nrelativity cosmology until 1932. Following this, the historical\nparticipants in the philosophical debate are introduced, along with\nthe basic ideas of their competing positions. Then the critical stages\nof the debate \u2014 1935\u201337 \u2014 are closely explored by\nfocussing directly upon the arguments of the participating scientists\nand philosophers. Finally, the concluding stage of the philosophical\ndebate, namely, the emergence of the steady-state theory of the\nUniverse, is presented in the context of its development from\nPopper\u2019s philosophy of science.\n",
