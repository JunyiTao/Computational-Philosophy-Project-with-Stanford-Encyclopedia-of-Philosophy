For instance, R. Axelrod developed a computational model\nthat represented a target of two \u201cagents\u201d caught in an\niterated prisoner\u2019s dilemma, with the purpose of solving the\n dilemma.[14]\n\nThe term \u201cmodel\u201d in religious and philosophical contexts\nis related to but not identical with its use in scientific contexts,\nin ways Ian Barbour (1974) foundationally traced. Though there is some\ndisagreement between the fields on whether models describe their\ntarget or not and what the point of modeling is, importantly, in both\ncontexts, the term \u201cmodel\u201d (1) connotes that its target is\nsomehow out of reach\u2014not able to be directly examined\u2014and,\nperhaps by force of this, (2) encodes a conceptual distance between\nthe target and the model. In particular, the model is not a copy of\nthe target but rather chooses revealing aspects of the target to relay\nby leaving out or distorting other\n aspects.[15]\n Think of a model of a city that is by design not to scale, precisely\nso viewers can see the relationships between the city\u2019s streets,\nbuildings and neighborhoods. Models are thus simultaneously\nepistemically instructive and humble.\n\nThus understood, \u201cmodel\u201d captures well the ways people\nhave thought about what is ultimate. Taking a model\u2019s target to\nbe obscured per (1) and the model itself to be fallible per (2) is not\nonly apt but also crucial for thinking about what is ultimate given\nour necessarily limited knowledge of it (see\n Section 1.4).\n Moreover, among the choices on the linguistic menu,\n\u201cmodel\u201d is a middle way. It is more specific than\n\u201cidea\u201d understood in the Cartesian sense as\n\u201cwhatever is immediately perceived by the\n mind\u201d,[16]\n since a model is the more particular kind of idea just relayed. At\nthe same time, \u201cmodel\u201d is general enough to cover the very\ndiverse kinds of extant linguistic accounts of what is ultimate in the\nliterature, including, e.g., \u201cconcepts\u201d understood in the\nclassic sense as necessary and sufficient conditions for being\nultimate, such as Anselm\u2019s idea of God as \u201cthat than which\nno greater can be conceived;\u201d \u201cconceptions\u201d which\nare \u201cmore particular fillers\u201d for more general concepts,\nsuch as Richard Swinburne\u2019s verdict about what it would take to\nbe that than which nothing greater can be\n conceived;[17]\n sustained \u201cmetaphors\u201d such as Ramanuja\u2019s Brahman as\nthe \u201cSoul\u201d of the cosmos (see\n Section 2.1)\n or Sallie McFague\u2019s \u201cGod as Mother, Lover and\nFriend\u201d (1987); and \u201cindexical signs\u201d that point to\nan indeterminate ultimate visible in Neville (2013). This entry will\ncall all these linguistic types \u201cmodels\u201d of what is\nultimate, given that they each in their own way represent or aim at a\ntarget of what is ultimate for various purposes, at least as much as\nlanguage can (more in\n Section 1.4).[18]\n\nAs\n Section 1.5\n will detail, some models of what is ultimate nest, e.g.,\nShankara\u2019s idea of Brahman is a species of Vedantic ideas of\nBrahman which in turn are species of Hindu ideas of Brahman. To\nsimplify, this entry will use the term \u201cmodel\u201d for ideas\nof what is ultimate at all levels, and take a model\u2019s target to\nbe \u201cthe ultimate\u201d if the modeler thinks what is ultimate is\nsingle or uncountable (as in models of e.g., Brahman, God and the Dao)\nor \u201cultimates\u201d if multiple (as in polytheistic or perhaps\ncommunotheistic models).\n",
