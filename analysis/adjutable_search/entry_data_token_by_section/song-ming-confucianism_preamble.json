    "main_text": "\n\nConfucian thought in China\u2019s Song (960\u20131279 CE), Yuan\n(1279\u20131368 CE), and Ming (1368\u20131644 CE) dynasties is\nmarked by concerted efforts to weave the ideas expressed in\ntraditional Confucian texts into more coherent and theoretical\nworldviews, and to make more explicit what its advocates and\npractitioners take to be the Confucian tradition\u2019s metaphysics\nand moral psychology, and to refute and curtail the influence of\nBuddhism and Daoism. Many anthologies and histories of Chinese\nphilosophy treat the Song-Ming period as second only to the classical,\npre-Qin period in terms of its importance and influence on Confucian\nthought, with its two leading philosophers Zhu Xi (1130\u20131200)\nand Wang Yangming (1472\u20131529) doing the most to shape the\ntradition as we know it today. Most studies of this period focus on\nConfucians in the first and last of these dynasties, the Song and\nMing. There were several notable Confucian philosophers in the middle\nYuan dynasty as well, and the Yuan was also important for bringing\nstate support and institutional backing to the orthodoxy of the Song\nphilosopher Zhu Xi (Chen 2010: 241\u2013274). But scholars tend to\nrefer to Confucians of this period as \u201cSong-Ming\nConfucians\u201d, emphasizing the two most philosophically important\ndynasties and perhaps downplaying the relatively short-lived middle\ndynasty under Mongol rule.\n\nThe prominent figures in Song-Ming Confucianism held divergent and\noften mutually inconsistent views about each of the major issues of\ntheir era, but they participated in a shared discourse with a great\ndeal of overlapping philosophical vocabulary and points of reference.\nMoreover they tended to treat certain issues as more central than\nothers. Chief among these were questions about the sources of unity\nand order in the cosmos, moral aspects of human nature, how\none\u2019s subjective thoughts and feelings can and should align with\n(objective or less problematically subject-dependent) ethical norms,\nthe methods and means of cultivating virtues, and the sort of\ninstitutions and character necessary for good governance. There were\nsome areas of consensus. Confucians of this period tended to agree\nthat the family is in various respects the primary locus of moral\ndevelopment and the expression of virtue. They also shared the view\nthat human nature is fundamentally good, having well-formed capacities\nfor virtue and being linked in some profound way to broader processes\nof life production and nurturance. Most regarded a certain body of\nclassical Confucian texts as correct, including those they attributed\nto Confucius (Kongzi) and Mencius (Mengzi), although how much and in\nwhat ways one should defer to the authority of these texts was often\ncontested.\n",
