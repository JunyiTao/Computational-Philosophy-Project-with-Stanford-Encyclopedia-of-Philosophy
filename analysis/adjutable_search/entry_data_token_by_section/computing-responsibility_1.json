    "main_text": "Challenges to moral responsibility || Causal contribution\n1.1 Causal contribution\n\nIn order for a person to be held morally responsible for a particular\nevent, she has to be able to exert some kind of influence on that\nevent. It does not make sense to blame someone for an accident if she\ncould not have avoided it by acting differently or if she had no\ncontrol over the events leading up to the accident.\n\nHowever, computer technologies can obscure the causal connections\nbetween a person\u2019s actions and the eventual consequences.\nTracing the sequence of events that led to a computer-related\ncatastrophic incident, such as a plane crash, usually leads in many\ndirections, as such incidents are seldom the result of a single error\nor mishap. Technological accidents are commonly the product of an\naccumulation of mistakes, misunderstanding or negligent behavior of\nvarious individuals involved in the development, use and maintenance\nof computer systems, including designers, engineers, technicians,\nregulators, managers, users, manufacturers, sellers, resellers and\neven policy makers.\n\nThe involvement of multiple actors in the development and deployment\nof technologies gives rise to what is known as the problem of\n\u2018many hands\u2019: it is difficult to determine who was\nresponsible for what when multiple individuals contributed to the\noutcome of events (Jonas 1984; Friedman 1990; Nissenbaum 1994; van de\nPoel et al. 2015). One classic example of the problem of many hands in\ncomputing is the case of the malfunctioning radiation treatment\nmachine Therac-25 (Leveson and Turner 1993; Leveson 1995). This\ncomputer-controlled machine was designed for the radiation treatment\nof cancer patients as well as for X-rays. During a two-year period in\nthe 1980s the machine massively overdosed six patients, contributing\nto the eventual death of three of them. These incidents were the\nresult of the combination of a number of factors, including software\nerrors, inadequate testing and quality assurance, exaggerated claims\nabout the reliability, bad interface design, overconfidence in\nsoftware design, and inadequate investigation or follow-up on accident\nreports. Nevertheless, in their analysis of the events Leveson and\nTurner conclude that it is hard to place the blame on a single person.\nThe actions or negligence of all those involved might not have proven\nfatal were it not for the other contributing events. A more recent\nexample of the problem of many hands is the crash of two 737 MAX\npassenger aircraft in late 2018 and early 2019. These crashes led to\nmulitple investigations that highlighted various factors that\ncontributed to the tragic outcome, include design and human errors as\nwell as organizational culture and lack of training (Heckert et al\n2020). This is not to say that there is no moral responsibility in\nthese case (Nissenbaum 1994; Gotterbarn 2001; Coeckelbergh 2012;\nFloridi 2013, Santonio De Sio et al, 2021), as many actors could have\nacted differently, but it makes it more difficult to retrospectively\nidentify the appropriate person that can be called upon to answer and\nmake amends for the outcome.\n\nAdding to the problem of many hands is the temporal and physical\ndistance that computing creates between a person and the consequences\nof her actions, as this distance can blur the causal connection\nbetween actions and events (Friedman 1990). Computational technologies\nextend the reach of human activity through time and space. With the\nhelp of social media and communication technologies people can\ninteract with others on the other side of the world. Satellites and\nadvanced communication technologies allow pilots to fly a remotely\ncontrolled drone from their ground-control station half way across the\nworld. These technologies enable people to act over greater distances,\nbut this remoteness can dissociate the original actions from its\neventual consequences (Waelbers 2009; Polder-Verkiel 2012;\nCoeckelbergh 2013). When a person uses a technological artifact to\nperform an action thousands of miles a way, that person might not know\nthe people that will be affected and she might not directly, or only\npartially, experience the consequences. This can reduce the sense of\nresponsibility the person feels and it may interfere with her ability\nto fully comprehend the significance of her actions. Similarly, the\ndesigners of an automated decision-making system determine ahead of\ntime how decisions should be made, but they will rarely see how these\ndecisions will impact the individuals they affect. Their original\nactions in programming the system may have effects on people years\nlater.\n\nThe problem of many hands and the distancing effects of the use of\ntechnology illustrate the mediating role of technological artifacts in\nthe confusion about moral responsibility. Technological artifacts\nbring together the various different intentions of their creators and\nusers. People create and deploy technologies with the objective of\nproducing some effect in the world. Software developers develop an\nautomated content moderation tool, often at the request of their\nmanagers or clients, with the aim of shielding particular content from\nusers and influencing what these users can or cannot read. The\nsoftware has inscribed in its design the various intentions of the\ndevelopers, managers and clients; it is poised to behave, given a\nparticular input, according to their ideas about which information is\nappropriate (Friedman 1997, Gorwa, Binns, & Katzenbach 2020).\nMoral responsibility can therefore not be attributed without looking\nat the causal efficacy of these artifacts and how they constrain and\nenable particular human activities.\n\nHowever, although technological artefacts may influence and shape\nhuman action, they do not determine it. They are not isolated\ninstruments that mean and work the same regardless of why, by whom,\nand in what context they are used; they have interpretive flexibility\n(Bijker et al. 1987) or multistability (Ihde\n 1990).[2]\n Although the design of the technology provides a set of conditions\nfor action, the form and meaning of these actions is the result of how\nhuman agents choose to use these technologies in particular contexts.\nPeople often use technologies in ways unforeseen by their designers.\nThis interpretive flexibility makes it difficult for designers to\nanticipate all the possible outcomes of the use of their technologies.\nThe mediating role of computer technologies complicates the effort of\nretrospectively tracing back the causal connection between actions and\noutcomes, but it also complicates forward-looking responsibility.\n",
