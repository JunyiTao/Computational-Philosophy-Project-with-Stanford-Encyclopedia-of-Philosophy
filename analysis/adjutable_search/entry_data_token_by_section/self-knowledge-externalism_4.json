    "main_text": "The Reductio to Armchair Knowledge of the External World || Reply 3: Transmission Failure\n2.3 Reply 3: Transmission Failure\n\nIf externalism about empty concepts fails, then EXT may well entail\n(1) apriori, per the incompatibilist\u2019s reductio. But a\ncompatibilist could try a different line of resistance. She might\nsimply grant that (1) and (2) are apriori, but still try to block\napriori knowledge of (3). (Here too, E is assumed to be just\nthe condition where water exists, though it is believed that similar\npoints hold if (4) is true instead.) The most prominent strategy of\nthis type is to deny the \u201ctransmission of warrant\u201d that\nsupposedly occurs in the deduction of (3) from (1) and (2) (hereafter,\n\u201cthe deduction\u201d). The idea is that, even if the\nexternalist agrees that (1) and (2) are warranted, none of this\nwarrant \u201ctransmits\u201d to (3) in the deduction (Davies 1998;\n2000; 2003a; 2003b, Wright 2000a; 2000b; 2003; 2011; 2102; 2015; see\nalso Wright 1985). If so, the deduction cannot furnish apriori\nknowledge of (3), pace the incompatibilist.\n\nFor brevity, let us call the advocate of transmission failure\n\u201cthe advocate.\u201d Then, the advocate\u2019s core idea is\nthat even though (1) and (2) entail (3), they do not prove\n(3). For in brief, the \u201cproof\u201d seems question begging (cf.\nMcLaughlin 2000). \u2018Question begging\u2019, however, may not be\nthe right word here (Beebee 2001, Prichard 2002, Silins 2011). Still,\nthe idea is that (3) in some sense is presupposed, once the deduction\ngets started. If such circularity is operative, then the deduction\ncannot create any warrant for (3), much less prove it. Or in the\nadvocate\u2019s idiom, the warrant for (1) and (2) cannot\ntransmit to (3) in virtue of the deduction.\n\nAs a satisficing\n approximation,[16]\n the transmission of warrant generally occurs iff:\n\n\n\n(TW)\nIf a subject S is warranted in believing p and is\nwarranted in believing that p entails q (and S\nfurther recognizes that q follows deductively from these\nbeliefs)\u2014then S acquires, potentially for the first time,\na warrant in believing q. (Cf. Wright 2000a, p.\n140\u2013141.) \n\n\n\nYet (TW) should be distinguished from epistemic closure, as discussed\nby some anti-skeptics (e.g., Dretske 1970). Some compatibilists think\nthat the reductio also exemplifies a failure of epistemic closure (see\nBernecker 2000, Hale 2000, Sawyer 2006, although see Sawyer 2015 for a\n\u201ccontrastive\u201d account that upholds closure). Regardless,\ntransmission failure is a different affair, if only because epistemic\nclosure concerns \u201cknowledge\u201d rather than\n\u201cwarrant.\u201d Nevertheless, warrant transmission differs even\nfrom the \u201cclosure of warrant,\u201d characterized as\nfollows:\n\n\n\n(CW)\nIf S is warranted in believing p and warranted in\nbelieving that p entails q, then S is warranted\nin believing q (or is able to be thus warranted). \n\n\n\nThe difference between transmission and warrant closure is best seen\nin cases of question begging. Take an overtly circular argument which\nconcludes (3) using (3) as a premise. Trivially, anyone warranted in\nbelieving the premise is warranted in believing the conclusion. So\n(CW) is satisfied in this case. But the argument does not\ntransmit warrant to its conclusion; it cannot bestow any\nwarrant on (3) that was not already there. From a different angle, a\nperson cannot use the argument to gain knowledge of (3) for the\nvery first time. Hence, warrant fails to transmit onto the\nconclusion, even though warrant closure holds\n trivially.[17]\n\n\nThe advocate thus cries \u201ctransmission failure\u201d in relation\nto (1)\u2013(3), on the grounds that (3) is\n\u201cpresupposed.\u201d Yet in this case, the presupposition charge\nis not as straightforward. For clarity\u2019s sake, let us call (1)\nand (2) the \u201c*premises\u201d of the deduction, to contrast them\nwith the premises of the reductio. (The latter are stronger in\nclaiming that the former are apriori.) Then, the advocate bases the\npresupposition charge on the following: An externalist can rationally\ngrant that the *premises are warranted only if she has certain\n\u201cbackground assumptions\u201d which already imply (3).\nThe point is sometimes framed in terms of \u201cinformation\ndependence:\u201d An externalist who grants warrant to the *premises\n\u201crationally requires certain collateral information\u201d that\nincludes (3) (Wright 2000a, p. 149). Consequently, an\nexternalist\u2019s \u201cacceptance of those [background]\nassumptions cannot be rationally combined with doubt about the truth\nof [(3)]\u201d (Davies 2003a, p. 43, but contrast Davies 2000, p.\n402).\n\nFor simplicity (since rational externalists are the only ones we care\nabout), assume henceforth that \u201cthe externalist\u201d is\nrational. Then, the presupposition charge is most readily appreciated\nvia the following\n approximation:[18]\n When considering the reductio,\n\n\n\nB(3)\nAn externalist grants that the *premises are warranted only if\n(3) is already among her Background assumptions. \n\n\n\nNote: B(3) is a \u201csecond order\u201d thesis about the\ndialectics of the reductio; the antecedent is a condition where the\nexternalist grants that the *premises are warranted\n(regardless of whether they are warranted). Thus\nB(3) says that the externalist will be presuming (3), if\nshe concedes warrant to the *premises in the first place. It is in\nthis sense that (3) is presupposed once the deduction is mobilized,\nresulting in transmission failure.\n\nAn argument for B(3) has yet to be given, but there are two\non offer. The first opens with the remark that, since EXT requires\nwater for thinking \u201cwater is wet\u201d (as all parties are\ncurrently allowing), the same is true of the self-attributing thought\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking that water is wet.\u201d (Davies 2000\n2003a, 2003b). However, if a person regards this metaphysical claim as\nwarranted along with (2) \u2014then she cannot rationally\nput (3) in doubt. For if the existence of water were in doubt, then\ngiven her warranted metaphysical claim, this rationally compels a\nfurther doubt on whether the thought expressed by (2) exists\nin the first place. But the existence of the thought must be\nacknowledged before one can concede a warrant to it. So our\nexternalist will rationally allow a warrant to both *premises only if\nshe already assumes (3) as background, which is just what\nB(3)says.\n\nThe second argument we might attribute to a character called\n\u201cWrightgenstein\u201d or just \u201cW.\u201d for short, since\nit originates in Crispin Wright\u2019s interpretive work on\nWittgenstein. Qua externalist, W. acknowledges the possibility of\nerror in discerning one\u2019s own mental contents, as when Dry Oscar\nmisjudges his empty concept to have a natural kind content. Even so,\nhe sees no reason to surrender the warrant possessed by ordinary\njudgments about content. This parallels a natural view of perceptual\njudgment: Even though perceptual illusions occur, ordinarily we still\npossess warrant for our perceptual judgments about the world. W.\nthinks this is because our ordinary perceptual and self-attributing\njudgments enjoy a kind of \u201cdefault\u201d warrant. Such a\nwarrant discounts the possibility of illusion, even when one has\ngathered no supporting empirical evidence. Though if a reasonable\nsuspicion arises, the default no longer applies. But ordinarily our\njudgments are \u201cpresumed innocent\u201d of error until proven\n(or at least evidenced to be) guilty; this in turn is rooted in our\ncommunal practices, and is justified on pragmatic grounds (Wright\n2000a, p. 152\u2013153).\n\nAll this is important for B(3), since if W. grants (2) a\nwarrant in the absence of empirical investigation, it will be a\ndefault warrant (at least in part). And this kind of warrant exists\nonly in ordinary cases. Thus, he grants this warrant only if\nhe assumes that there is no Dry Earth illusion where (3) merely\nappears to be true. So in particular, in the context of the reductio,\nW. allows an apriori warrant to the *premises only if (3) is already\nassumed as background. QED\n\nLet us now consider some objections to transmission failure. One\naccuses the advocate of conflating different types of warrant (Raffman\n1998, Sainsbury 2000). Note here that, if the deduction fails to\nprove the conclusion, this does not mean it transmits no\nwarrant at all. (Beebee 2001, Burge 2003). The objector accordingly\nsuggests that the deduction indeed transmits a warrant, though it is a\n\u201cthinner\u201d warrant, i.e., a warrant that is weaker than\nwhat a proof would bestow. But if a thinner warrant transmits, then\ncontra the advocate, the deduction indeed confers some apriori warrant\n(albeit non-demonstrative warrant) onto (3). This, then, vindicates a\nversion of the reductio\u2014for the intuition is that we cannot\nwarrant apriori a claim about the world at all. \n\nBut is this intuition correct? To evaluate it we need further clarity\non what a \u201cthin\u201d warrant is. Some understand this as the\nwarrant failing as a warrant for equivalent propositions. For\ninstance, a non-empirical thin warrant for (2) may fail to warrant the\nextensionally equivalent \u2018I am thinking that H2O is\nwet\u2019 (Davies 2003b, p. 114 and 118). Alternatively,\n\u201cthinness\u201d for W. may reflect that the warrant is not\nsomething earned by gathering empirical or proof-theoretic\nevidence. It is instead just a defeasible \u201centitlement\u201d\nthat holds only in the ordinary cases (Wright 2003).\n\nIf the latter is what \u201cthinness\u201d consists in, then an\nadvocate could try to grant the transmission of a thinner\nwarrant\u2014but still emphasize that transmission failure is the\nrule when the warrants are thicker (Davies 2003b, but compare Wright\n2003, p. 72). Yet an advocate might take a stronger stance by doubting\nwhether any thinner warrants transmits. After all, this\nputative warrant dissipates immediately once any earnest doubt is\nraised (Wright 2000b, yet contrast with Wright 2003; 2011).\n\nA different objection to the advocate is that, despite appearances,\nshe ends up surrendering SK after all. This is because (3) is\nempirical and it is conceded that (2) presupposes (3) (cf. Wright\n2000, p. 151\u2013152). And so, it is hard to see how (2) can be\nwarranted purely apriori if it presupposes empirical facts about the\nworld.\n\nIn response, at least one externalist has relinquished apriori\nknowledge of (2), but emphasizes that some self-knowledge still\nremains apriori (Rowlands 2003, ch. 8). In particular, an externalist\ncould still know apriori that:\n\nIf E obtains, then I am thinking that water is wet.\n\n\nBut for his part, W. thinks apriori knowledge of (2) should not be\nsurrendered. Instead, he claims we should not assume that the warrant\nfor (3) is inevitably empirical. For (3) ordinarily has a\nnon-empirical \u201cdefault\u201d warrant. So given that (2)\npresupposes (3), a non-empirical warrant for (3) makes possible an\napriori warrant for (2). Even so, W. is quick to remind us that a\ndefault warrant for (3) is too \u201cthin\u201d to prove\n(3).\n\nHowever, if the advocate grants an apriori warrant to (3), this may\nsuccumb already to the reductio (Brown 2003; 2004, Sawyer 2006,\nBrueckner 2006). For the absurdity was not that an apriori warrant\ntransmits; instead, it was in thinking that (3) can be apriori\nwarranted at all. \n\nAdvocates can respond in two different ways here. One is to be neutral\non whether (3) is apriori warranted. A neutral position may suffice\nfor the advocate\u2019s purposes, since transmission failure occurs\nif (3) is presupposed, regardless of whether it is apriori\nwarranted (Davies 2000). But such a response is not available to W.,\nfor he clearly thinks that (3) ordinarily has a non-empirical warrant.\nStill, perhaps W. could soften this by reiterating that this is a\n\u201cthin\u201d warrant bestowed by default; it is not a warrant\nthat is transmitted onto (3) by the deduction.\n\nA final worry for W. is that he is conflating the psychological\nphenomenon of SK with something merely linguistic or\n\u201cgrammatical\u201d (Snowdon 2012). If an externalist wishes to\nexplain how knowledge of content is possible, why would she\nappeal to a linguistic convention to illuminate the matter?\nIt is clear, however, that W. never meant to forbid psychology from\nhaving its say (Wright 2015, p.54). But it is possible that our\nlinguistic practices for crediting self-knowledge have mislead us\nabout the psychological facts. An analogy with ethical expressivism is\nhelpful on this score (cf. Wright 2015, p. 55) Instead of\ninvestigating the \u201creal moral facts,\u201d ethical\nexpressivists try to account for moral discourse, precisely due to the\nsuspicion that the discourse may not be grounded in bona fide facts of\nthe relevant sort. Similarly, there may be a suspicion in W. that a\nrobust psychological phenomenon of \u201carmchair\nself-knowledge\u201d simply does not exist. Nonetheless, it may be\ndesirable for us to speak as if there was such knowledge, given our\naims and interests more broadly.\n",
