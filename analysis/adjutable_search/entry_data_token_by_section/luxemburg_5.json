    "main_text": "Women\u2019s emancipation\n6. Women\u2019s emancipation\n\n\nHistorically interpreted as a Marxist theorist at best indifferent to\nthe question of women\u2019s emancipation, recent scholarship has\nbeen more nuanced in their assessments of Luxemburg\u2019s\ncontribution to feminism (Dunayevskaya 1981; Ettinger 1987; Haug\n2007). As with the case of national self-determination, her position\non gender issues is more sophisticated than a simplified reading of\nher texts affords. It is well known that Luxemburg often rejected\ncalls from her colleagues in the Second International to be\nexclusively involved with what they called the \u201cwomen\nquestion\u201d. However, as many of her articles, political\ninterventions and letters make clear, Luxemburg was a fierce champion\nof women\u2019s rights and of the contribution that advocacy for\nwomen representation made to socialist emancipation more\ngenerally. What she did reject is the kind of tokenistic feminism\nwhich limited itself to the suffrage campaign and isolated the\nquestion of female emancipation from the critique of capitalism. As\nshe put it, bourgeois women \u201cwho act like lionessess in the\nstruggle against \u2018male prerogatives\u2019 \u2026 are nothing\nbut co-consumers of the surplus value their men extort from the\nproletariat\u201d. These \u201cparasites of the parasites of the\nsocial body\u201d, she wrote \u201care usually even more rabid and\ncruel in defending their \u2018right\u2019 to a parasite\u2019s\nlife than the direct agents of class rule and exploitation\u201d\n(Luxemburg 1902 [RLR: 240]).\n\n\nLike her colleagues Clara Zetkin and Alexandra Kollontai who were\nactively contributing to the development of socialist feminism,\nLuxemburg also believed that under capitalism women were doubly\noppressed: in the family and in the workplace. Like them, she did not\nthink that conflicts over gender could be reduced to the antagonism\nbetween men and women but argued that they have deeper roots in in a\ncapitalist system where only paid labour is considered productive. In\nthis she could be seen as an early pioneer of social reproduction\ntheory, offering an analysis of capital accumulation in which the\ncommodification of domestic labour is a crucial step in the\nprogressive expansion of capitalist relations to non-capitalist realms\nsuch as the household (Cakardic 2017).\n\n\nWhile Luxemburg did not make this argument directly, her defence of\nwomen\u2019s rights was coupled with a harsh critique of the\ncapitalist system which viewed domestic labour, i.e.  the labour\ntraditionally performed by working women as unproductive, and in which\nproletarian women lacked even the basic political rights to support\ntheir calls to end economic exploitation. This is why, when Belgian\nsocial democrats agreed to an alliance with the liberal party which\nled them to abandon the demand to give votes to women, Luxemburg\ncondemned the agreement in the harshest terms. She insisted that women\nsuffrage would not only improve democratic representation in general\nbut also \u201cclear out the suffocating air of the current,\nphilistine, family life that rubs itself off so unmistakably, even on\nour Party members, workers and leaders alike\u201d (Luxemburg 1902\n[RLR: 236]). \n\n\nYet Luxemburg\u2019s arguments in support of women representation\nwere never confined to a demand for abstract legal recognition in\nliberal parliamentary democracies. She was vividly aware that the few\nprivileges extended to Western feminist campaigners might come at the\nprice of the ongoing exploitation of women in other parts of the\nworld. In an article entitled \u201cProletarian Women\u201d, she\nwrote movingly about the struggles of women in German Africa where\n\u201cthe bones of defenseless Herero women are bleaching in the\nsun\u201d and about \u201cthe high cliffs of Putumayo\u201d where\n\u201cthe death cries of martyred Indian women, ignored by the world,\nfade away in the rubber plantations of the international\ncapitalists\u201d (Luxemburg 1914 [RLR: 245]). In this sense,\nLuxemburg\u2019s calls to advance women\u2019s struggle, were part\nof her more general argument that the demand for social rights\nobtained through parliamentary representation ought to be part of a\nmore radical critique of capitalism where the key is access to\npolitical power and a profound transformation of both the economic and\nthe political structures of society. Within existing capitalist\ninstitutions, she insisted, there could be no true gender and racial\nemancipation. The only secure foundation for the rights of women, she\nargued, was for them to join the social democratic movement where they\ncould affirm their equality through mass orgnisation and protest\nalongside men, and where they could shake the pillars of the existing\nlegal order before it grants them \u201cthe illusion of \u2026\nrights\u201d (Luxemburg 1914 [RLR: 244]).\n",
