    "main_text": "The logic of negation || Other conceptions of negation as a unary connective\n2.5 Negation, rejection, and denial\n\nAs already remarked, negation has been analyzed, for example, as a\ntruth-functional operator, a modal operator, a propositional attitude,\nand a speech act. The exact relation between negation as a connective,\nthe propositional attitude of rejection and, notably, the speech act\nof denial is contentious. There is, as a kind of orthodox view, a\nthesis defended by Frege (1919) and Geach (1965), namely that denying\n\\(A\\) is the same as asserting \\(A\\)\u2019s negation. This view implies\nwhat Ripley (2011b, 623) calls the denial\nequivalence:\n\n\nthat to assert the negation of a content \\(A\\) is equivalent, in its\nconversational effects and commitments carried, to denying \\(A\\). \n\n\n(Note that Parsons (1984) refers to the claim that denying \\(A\\) is\nalways the same as asserting \\(\\osim A\\) as the \u201cEquivalence\nThesis.\u201d) There is, however, no clear syntactic restriction on\nspeech acts of denial, as denials can be realized not only by\nassertions of negated sentences but, for example, also by means of\nirony. Moreover, whereas negated sentences can be embedded into\ncompound sentences, speech acts cannot be constituents of other speech\nacts. Therefore, if it is held that to deny is to\nassert a negation, the idea is that acts of denial can be analyzed as\nassertions of (propositions expressed by) negated sentences. It may,\nfor instance, be held that it is revealing to understand denials of\n\\(A\\) as assertions of \\(\u00a9 A\\), for some contrary-forming negation\noperator \\(\u00a9\\).\n\nBut there is also a position called \u201crejectivism\u201d defended\nby, for example, Price (1983, 1990), Smiley (1996), and Rumfitt\n(2000). Lloyd Humberstone (2000a: 331) characterizes rejectivism as\nfollows:\n\n\nWhether assent (\u201cacceptance\u201d) and dissent\n(\u201crejection\u201d) are thought of as speech acts or as\npropositional attitudes, the idea of rejectivism is that a\ngrasp of the distinction between them is prior to our understanding of\nnegation as a sentence, this operator then being explicable as\napplying to \\(A\\) to yield something assent to which is tantamount to\ndissent from \\(A\\).\n\n\nAt issue is the conceptual priority of the notions of assertion and\ndenial over the concept of negation. But if the notion of denial is\nconceptually prior to the concept of negation, one may wonder why\nnegation is needed at all and how Frege\u2019s argument that an\naccount of negation in terms of denial does not make sense of embedded\nnegations can be met.\n\nAs Ripley (2011b) remarks, rejectivists are typically inferentialists,\ni.e., they hold that the meaning of the logical operations can be\nexplicated in terms of meaning-conveying rules. If inferentialism is\ndeveloped in terms of rules for asserting and rules\nfor denying compound formulas (as, for example, in Price 1983, 1990;\nRumfitt 2000) according to Ripley (2011b), the above questions can be\nanswered by explaining that negation is a switch between warranted\nassertability conditions and warranted deniability conditions. This\nrole of negation is similar to the role strong negation in\nNelson\u2019s logics plays in turning support of truth conditions\ninto support of falsity condition, and vice versa. Price\n(1990, 225) argues that\n\n\nif we allow that (an utterance of) \\(\\osim P\\) may properly be\nregarded both as a denial with content \\(P\\) and as an assertion with\ncontent \\(\\osim P\\), then Frege\u2019s argument is powerless; for in\nthis case the latter reading is available to explain the contribution\nof \\(\\osim P\\) to complex constructions, in the standard way.\n\n\nBut one may require more from the rejectivist, namely that every\nformula is logically equivalent to a formula in what Humberstone\n(2000a, Footnote 10) calls \u201cBendall normal form\u201d, namely\nto a formula that contains at most one occurrence of the negation sign\nas the principal connective. According to Bendall (1979, 68), the\nredundancy in this sense of the embedding of a negation operator,\n\n\nopens the way for an attempt to construe the meaning of negation as\nderiving from the mental or behavioral phenomena of judgment,\ndisbelief, and denial.\n\n\nThe normal form result holds for classical propositional logic\n(CPL) in the connectives \\(\\osim\\), \\(\\wedge\\),\n\\(\\vee\\), and \\(\\rightarrow\\). As Humberstone points out, it fails for\nthe negation, conjunction, disjunction fragment of\nCPL, since in classical propositional logic the\nBendall normal form (bnf) of a conjunction of atomic formulas \\((p\n\\wedge \\osim q)\\) is \\(\\osim (p \\rightarrow q)\\). Moreover, the\ntranslation of \\((\\osim p \\rightarrow q)\\) into bnf is \\((p \\vee q)\\),\nand the translation of \\(\\osim \\osim p\\) is \\(p\\). These pairs of\nformulas are not logically equivalent in intuitionistic propositional\nlogic (IPL). The translation of \\((\\osim p\n\\rightarrow \\osim q)\\) into bnf is \\((q \\rightarrow p)\\), which is not\nlogically equivalent to \\((\\osim p \\rightarrow \\osim q)\\) in\nN3 and N4. An in-depth investigation\nof sequent calculi using formulas prefixed by an assertion sign [+] or\na rejection sign [\u2013], understood as non-embeddable force\nindicators, can be found in Bendall 1978, Humberstone 2000a.\n\nHumberstone (2000a, 368) challenges rejectivism, by asking the\nrejectivists to \u201cshow how the claim for the conceptual priority\nof rejection over negation is any more plausible than the\ncorresponding claim for the conceptual priority of alterjection over\ndisjunction\u2014or indeed, ambi-assertion over conjunction,\u201d\nwhere alterjection (ambi-assertion) is the supposedly primitive speech\nact the linguistic embodiment of which is disjunction\n(conjunction).\n\nAnother way of repulsing the denial equivalence is to argue that\ndenial and rejection are conceptually independent from the concept of\nnegation. Such an independence is defended, for example in van der\nSandt and Maier 2003\n (Other Internet Resources)\n and Priest 2006, Chapter 6. As mentioned in the\n supplement, section 3,\n according to Priest negation is for the main part a\ncontradictory-forming operator. Nevertheless, Priest believes that\nthere exist \u201cdialetheia\u201d, sentences \\(A\\) and \\(\\osim A\\)\nthat are both true. In the\n dialetheism\n entry, Berto, Priest, and Weber explain that\n\n\na dialetheist manifests her dialetheism in accepting, together with\nthe LNC [Law of Non-Contradiction], sentences that are inconsistent\nwith it, that is, true sentences whose negations are true:\ndialetheias.\n\n\nThis view seems to preclude dialetheists from expressing disagreement\nconcerning \\(A\\) as cases in which one person asserts \\(A\\) and\nanother person asserts \\(\\osim A\\). A dialetheist might assert \\(\\osim\nA\\) without disagreeing with \\(A\\). Therefore, if the assertion of\n\\(\\osim A\\) is declared to be conceptually independent from the denial\nof \\(A\\), disagreement concerning \\(A\\) can be represented as cases in\nwhich one person asserts \\(A\\) and another person denies \\(A\\). A\ncritical discussion of this approach may be found in Ripley 2011b.\n",
