Frege essentially reconceived the discipline of logic by\nconstructing a formal system which, in effect, constituted the first\n\u2018predicate calculus\u2019. In this formal system, Frege\ndeveloped an analysis of quantified statements and formalized the\nnotion of a \u2018proof\u2019 in terms that are still accepted\ntoday. Frege then demonstrated that one could use his system to\nresolve theoretical mathematical statements in terms of simpler\nlogical and mathematical notions. One of the axioms that Frege later\nadded to his system, in the attempt to derive significant parts of\nmathematics from logic, proved to be inconsistent. Nevertheless, his\ndefinitions (e.g., of the predecessor relation and of the\nconcept of natural number) and methods (e.g., for deriving\nthe axioms of number theory) constituted a significant advance. To\nground his views about the relationship of logic and mathematics,\nFrege conceived a comprehensive philosophy of language that many\nphilosophers still find insightful, though recent scholarship suggests\nthat Frege borrowed a significant number of elements in his philosophy\nof language from the Stoics.  Moreover, his lifelong project, of\nshowing that mathematics was reducible to logic, was not\nsuccessful. \n", "toc": [{"#FreLif": "1. Frege\u2019s Life and Influences"}, {"#FreLogMat": "2.

Frege\u2019s Life and Influences\n\nAccording to the curriculum vitae that the 26-year old Frege\nfiled in 1874 with his Habilitationsschrift, he was born on\nNovember 8, 1848 in Wismar, a town then in Mecklenburg-Schwerin but\nnow in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.  His father, Alexander, a headmaster of\na secondary school for girls, and his mother, Auguste (nee\nBialloblotzky), brought him up in the Lutheran faith. Frege attended\nthe local Gymnasium for 15 years, and after graduation in 1869,\nentered the University of Jena (see Frege 1874, translation in\nMcGuinness (ed.) 1984, 92).\nAt Jena, Frege attended lectures by Ernst Karl Abbe, who\nsubsequently became Frege\u2019s mentor and who had a significant\nintellectual and personal influence on Frege\u2019s life.  Frege\ntransferred to the University of G\u00f6ttingen in 1871, and two years\nlater, in 1873, was awarded a Ph.D. in mathematics, having written a\ndissertation under Ernst Schering titled \u00dcber eine\ngeometrische Darstellung der imagin\u00e4ren Gebilde in der Ebene\n(\u201cOn a Geometrical Representation of Imaginary Forms in the\nPlane\u201d). Frege explains the project in his thesis as follows:\n\u201cBy a geometrical representation of imaginary forms in the plane\nwe understand accordingly a kind of correlation in virtue of which\nevery real or imaginary element of the plane has a real, intuitive\nelement corresponding to it\u201d (Frege 1873, translation in\nMcGuinness (ed.)  1984, 3).  Here, by \u2018imaginary\nforms\u2019, Frege is referring to imaginary points, imaginary curves\nand lines, etc.  Interestingly, one section of the thesis concerns the\nrepresentation of complex numbers by magnitudes of angles in the\nplane.\nIn 1874, Frege completed his Habilitationsschrift,\nentitled Rechnungsmethoden, die sich auf eine Erweiterung\ndes Gr\u00f6ssenbegriffes gr\u00fcnden (\u201cMethods of\nCalculation Based on an Extension of the Concept of Quantity\u201d).\nImmediately after submitting this thesis, the good offices of\nAbbe led Frege to become a Privatdozent (Lecturer) at\nthe University of Jena.  Library records from the University of Jena\nestablish that, over the next 5 years, Frege checked out texts in\nmechanics, analysis, geometry, Abelian functions, and elliptical\nfunctions (Kreiser 1984, \n 21).[1] \n No doubt, many of these texts helped him to\nprepare the lectures he is listed as giving by the University of Jena\ncourse bulletin, for these lectures are on topics that often match the\ntexts, i.e., analytic geometry, elliptical and Abelian functions,\nalgebraic analysis, functions of complex variables, etc. (Kratzsch\n1979).[2]\nThis course of Frege\u2019s reading and lectures during the period of\n1874\u20131879 dovetailed quite naturally with the interests he\ndisplayed in his Habilitationsschrift. The \u2018extension\nof the concept of quantity\u2019 referred to in the title concerns\nthe fact that our understanding of quantities (e.g., lengths,\nsurfaces, etc.)  has to be extended in the context of complex\nnumbers.[3] He\nsays, right at the beginning of this work:\n\n According to the old conception, length appears as something material\nwhich fills the straight line between its end points and at the same\ntime prevents another thing from penetrating into its space by its\nrigidity. In adding quantities, we are therefore forced to place one\nquantity against another.  Something similar holds for surfaces and\nsolid contents. The introduction of negative quantities made a dent in\nthis conception, and imaginary quantities made it completely\nimpossible. Now all that matters is the point of origin and the end\npoint \u2013 the idea of filling the space has been completely\nlost. All that has remained is certain general properties of addition,\nwhich now emerge as the essential characteristic marks of quantity.\nThe concept has thus gradually freed itself from intuition and made\nitself independent. This is quite unobjectionable, especially since\nits earlier intuitive character was at bottom mere appearance.\nBounded straight lines and planes enclosed by curves can certainly be\nintuited, but what is quantitative about them, what is common to\nlengths and surfaces, escapes our intuition. \u2026 There is\naccordingly a noteworthy difference between geometry and arithmetic in\nthe way in which their fundamental principles are grounded. The\nelements of all geometrical constructions are intuitions, and geometry\nrefers to intuition as the source of its axioms. Since the object of\narithmetic does not have an intuitive character, its fundamental\npropositions cannot stem from intuition\u2026 (Frege 1874,\ntranslation in McGuinness (ed.) 1984, 56)\n \nHere we can see the beginning of two lifelong interests of Frege,\nnamely, (1) in how concepts and definitions developed for one domain\nfare when applied in a wider domain, and (2) in the contrast between\nlegitimate appeals to intuition in geometry and illegitimate appeals\nto intuition in the development of pure number theory. Indeed, some\nrecent scholars have (a) shown how Frege\u2019s work in logic was informed\nin part by his understanding of the analogies and disanalogies between\ngeometry and number theory (Wilson 1992), and (b) shown that Frege was\nintimately familiar with the division among late 19th century\nmathematicians doing complex analysis who split over whether it is\nbetter to use the analytic methods of Weierstrass or the intuitive\ngeometric methods of Riemann (Tappenden 2006). Weierstrass\u2019s 1872\npaper, describing a real-valued function that is continuous\neverywhere but differentiable \n nowhere,[4]\n was well known and provided an example of an ungraphable functions\nthat places limits on intuition. Yet, at the same time, Frege clearly\naccepted Riemann\u2019s practice and methods derived from taking functions\nas fundamental, as opposed to Weierstrass\u2019s focus on functions that\ncan be represented or analyzed in terms of other mathematical objects\n(e.g., complex power series).\nIn 1879, Frege published his first book Begriffsschrift, eine\nder arithmetischen nachgebildete Formelsprache des reinen Denkens\n(Concept Notation: A formula language of pure thought, modelled\nupon that of arithmetic) and was promoted\nto au\u00dferordentlicher Professor (Extraordinarius Professor)\nat Jena.  Although the Begriffsschrift constituted a major\nadvance in logic, it was neither widely understood nor well-received.\nSome scholars have suggested that this was due to the facts that the\nnotation was 2-dimensional instead of linear and that he didn\u2019t build\nupon the work of others but rather presented something radically new\n(e.g., Mendelsohn 2005, 2).  Though our discussion below is framed\nprimarily with an eye towards the system Frege developed in his\ntwo-volume work of 1893/1903 (Grundgesetze der Arithmetik),\nthe principal elements of this later system can be found already in\nthe Begriffsschrift of 1879.\nFrege\u2019s next really significant work was his second book,\nDie Grundlagen der Arithmetik: eine logisch mathematische\nUntersuchung \u00fcber den Begriff der Zahl, published in\n1884. Frege begins this work with criticisms of previous attempts to\ndefine the concept of number, and then offers his own\nanalysis. The Grundlagen contains a variety of insights still\ndiscussed today, such as: (a) the claim that a statement of number\n(e.g., \u2018there are eight planets\u2019) is a higher-order\nassertion about a concept (see Section 2.5 below); (b) his famous\nContext Principle (\u201cnever ask for the meaning of a word in\nisolation, but only in the context of a proposition\u201d), and (c)\nthe formulation of a principle (now called \u2018Hume\u2019s\nPrinciple\u2019 in the secondary literature) that asserts the\nequivalence of the claim \u201cthe number of Fs is equal to\nthe number of Gs\u201d with the claim that \u201cthere is a\none-to-one correspondence between the objects falling under F\nand the objects falling under G\u201d (see Section 2.5 below).\nMore generally, Frege provides in the Grundlagen a\nnon-technical philosophical justification and outline of the ideas\nthat he was to develop technically in his two-volume\nwork Grundgesetze der Arithmetik (1893/1903).\nIn the years 1891\u20131892, Frege gave more thought to the\nphilosophy of language that would help ground his philosophy of\nmathematics. He published three of his most well-known papers,\n\u2018Function and Concept\u2019 (1891), \u2018On Sense and\nReference\u2019 (1892a), and \u2018On Concept and Object\u2019\n(1892b) in this period.  These works were eventually supplemented by\nthree other papers on the philosophy of language, from a later period,\n\u2018The Thought\u2019 (1918a), \u2018Negation\u2019 (1918b), and\n\u2018Compound Thoughts\u2019 (1923).  As we shall see in Section\n3.3 below, these works have to be considered in light of recent\nscholarship providing evidence that Frege heavily borrowed from Stoic\nphilosophy.  Though Frege always motivated and recast (often in\nrigorous terms) ideas that he absorbed from others, the documentation\nconcerning the origins of many of his ideas in the Stoic corpus has to\nbe taken seriously.\n\nIn 1893, he published the first volume of the technical work\npreviously mentioned, Grundgesetze der Arithmetik.  In 1896,\nhe was promoted to ordentlicher Honorarprofessor (regular\nhonorary professor).  Six years later (on June 16, 1902), as he was\npreparing the proofs of the second volume of\nthe Grundgesetze, he received a letter from Bertrand Russell,\ninforming him that one could derive a contradiction in the system he\nhad developed in the first volume.  Russell\u2019s letter frames the\nparadox first in terms of the predicate P = \u2018being a\npredicate which cannot be predicated of itself\u2019, and then in\nterms of the class of all those classes that are not members of\nthemselves.  Frege, in the Appendix to the second volume, rephrased\nthe paradox in terms of his own system. \n\nFrege never fully recovered from the fatal flaw discovered in the\nfoundations of his Grundgesetze.  His attempts at salvaging\nthe work by restricting Basic Law V were not successful. However, he\ncontinued teaching at Jena, and from 1903\u20131917, he published six\npapers, including \u2018What is a Function?\u2019 (1904) and\n\u2018On the Foundations of Geometry\u2019 (Frege 1903b and 1906).\nIn the latter, Frege criticized Hilbert\u2019s understanding and use of the\naxiomatic method (see the entry on the\n  Frege-Hilbert controversy). From\nthis time period, we have the lecture notes that Rudolf Carnap took as\na student in two of his courses (see Reck and Awodey 2004). In 1917,\nhe retired from the University of Jena.\nIn the last phase of his life, from 1917\u20131925, Frege\npublished only the papers mentioned earlier (1918a, 1918b, 1923) and\ndeveloped some unpublished fragments of philosophical works.\nUnfortunately, his last years saw him become more than just\npolitically conservative \u2013 his diary for a brief period in 1924\nshow sympathies for fascism and anti-Semitism (see Frege 1924 [1996],\ntranslated by R. Mendelsohn).  He died on July 26, 1925, in Bad\nKleinen (now in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern).\n2. Frege\u2019s Logic and Philosophy of Mathematics\n\n\nFrege provided a foundations for the modern discipline of logic by\ndeveloping a more perspicuous method of formally representing the\nlogic of thoughts and inferences. He did this by developing: (a) a\nsystem allowing one to study inferences formally, (b) an analysis of\ncomplex sentences and quantifier phrases that showed an underlying\nunity to certain classes of inferences, (c) an analysis\nof proof and definition, (d) a theory of extensions\nwhich, though seriously flawed, offered an intriguing picture of the\nfoundations of mathematics, (e) an analysis of statements about number\n(i.e., of answers to the question \u2018How many?\u2019), (f)\ndefinitions and proofs of some of the basic axioms of number theory\nfrom a limited set of logically primitive concepts and axioms, and (g)\na conception of logic as a discipline which has some compelling\nfeatures. We discuss these developments in the following\nsubsections. However, it should be noted that, for those who are\nencountering it for the first time, we have simplified the\npresentation of Frege\u2019s logic in a significant number of ways.\nFor those already familiar with the notation and who want to see a\nmore precise presentation, see the entry on\n  Frege\u2019s logic.\n2.1 The Basis of Frege\u2019s Term Logic and Predicate Calculus\n\n\nIn an attempt to realize Leibniz\u2019s ideas for a universal formal\nlanguage and a rational calculus, Frege developed a formal notation\nfor regimenting thought and reasoning. Though this notation was first\noutlined in his Begriffsschrift (1879), the most mature\nstatement of Frege\u2019s system was in his 2-volume Grundgesetze der\nArithmetik (1893/1903). Frege\u2019s two systems are best\ncharacterized as term logics, since all of the complete expressions\nare denoting terms. Frege analyzed ordinary predication in these\nsystems, and so they can also be conceived as predicate calculi. A\npredicate calculus is a formal system (a formal language and a method\nof proof) in which one can represent valid inferences among\npredications, i.e., among statements in which properties are\npredicated of objects.\n\n\nIn this subsection, we shall examine the most basic elements of\nFrege\u2019s 1893/1903 term logic and predicate calculus. These are the\nstatements involving function applications and the simple predications\nwhich fall out as a special case.\n2.1.1 The Basis of Frege\u2019s Term Logic\n\n\nIn Frege\u2019s term logic, all of the terms and well-formed formulas\nare denoting expressions. These include: (a) simple names of objects,\nlike \u2018\\(2\\)\u2019 and \u2018\\(\\pi\\)\u2019, (b) complex terms\nwhich denote objects, like \u2018\\(2^2\\)\u2019 and \u2018\\(3 +\n1\\)\u2019, and (c) sentences (which are also complex terms). The\ncomplex terms in (b) and (c) are formed with the help of\n\u2018incomplete expressions\u2019 which signify functions, such as\nthe unary squaring function \u2018\\((\\:)^2\\)\u2019 and the binary\naddition function \u2018\\((\\:) + (\\:)\\)\u2019. In these functional\nexpressions, \u2018\\((\\:)\\)\u2019 is used as a placeholder for what\nFrege called the arguments of the function; the placeholder\nreveals that the expressions signifying function are, on Frege\u2019s\nview, incomplete and stand in contrast to complete expressions such as\nthose in (a), (b), and (c). (Though Frege thought it inappropriate to\ncall the incomplete expressions that signify functions\n\u2018names\u2019, we shall sometimes do so in what follows, though\nthe reader should be warned that Frege had reasons for not following\nthis practice.) Thus, a mathematical expression such as\n\u2018\\(2^2\\)\u2019 denotes the result of applying the\nfunction \\((\\:)^2\\) to the number \\(2\\) as argument, namely, the\nnumber \\(4\\). Similarly, the expression \u2018\\(7 + 1\\)\u2019 denotes the\nresult of applying the binary function \\(+((\\:),(\\:))\\) to the\nnumbers \\(7\\) and \\(1\\) as arguments, in that order.\n\n\nEven the sentences of Frege\u2019s mature logical system are\n(complex) denoting terms; they are terms that\ndenote truth-values. Frege distinguished two truth-values,\nThe True and The False, which he took to be objects. The basic\nsentences of Frege\u2019s system are constructed using the expression\n\u2018\\((\\:) = (\\:)\\)\u2019, which signifies a binary function that\nmaps a pair of objects x and\ny to The True if x is identical to y and\nmaps x and y to The False otherwise. A sentence such\nas \u2018\\(2^2 = 4\\)\u2019 therefore denotes the truth-value The\nTrue, while the sentence \u2018\\(2^2 = 6\\)\u2019 denotes The\nFalse.\n\n\nAn important class of these identity statements are statements of the\nform \u2018\\(f(x) = y\\)\u2019,\nwhere \\(f(\\:)\\) is any unary function\n(i.e., function of a single variable), \\(x\\) is the argument of the\nfunction, and \\(f(x)\\) is the value of the function for the argument\n\\(x\\). Similarly, \\(f(x,y) = z\\) is an identity statement involving a\nbinary function of two variables. And so on, for functions of\nmore than two variables.\n\n\nIf we replace a complete name appearing in a sentence by a\nplaceholder, the result is an incomplete expression that signifies a\nspecial kind of function which Frege called a concept.\nConcepts are functions which map every argument to one of the\ntruth-values. Thus, \u2018\\((\\:) \\gt 2\\)\u2019 denotes the concept\nbeing greater than \\(2\\), which maps every object greater\nthan \\(2\\) to The True and maps every other object to The\nFalse. Similarly, \u2018\\((\\:)^2 = 4\\)\u2019 denotes the\nconcept that which when squared is identical to \\(4\\). Frege\nwould say that any object that a concept maps to The True falls\nunder the concept. Thus, the number \\(2\\) falls under the\nconcept that which when squared is identical to \\(4\\). In\nwhat follows, we use lower-case expressions like \\(f(\\:)\\) to talk\ngenerally about functions, and upper-case expressions like \\(F(\\:)\\)\nto talk more specifically about those functions which are\nconcepts.\n\n\nFrege supposed that a mathematical claim such as \u2018\\(2\\) is\nprime\u2019 should be formally represented as\n\u2018\\(P(2)\\)\u2019. The verb phrase \u2018is prime\u2019 is\nthereby analyzed as denoting the concept \\(P(\\:)\\) which maps\nprimes to The True and everything else to The False. Thus, a simple\npredication like \u2018\\(2\\) is prime\u2019 becomes\nanalyzed in Frege\u2019s system as a special case of functional\napplication.\n2.1.2 The Predicate Calculus Within Frege\u2019s Term Logic\n\n\nThe preceding analysis of simple mathematical predications led Frege\nto extend the applicability of this system to the representation of\nnon-mathematical thoughts and predications. This move formed the basis\nof the modern predicate calculus. Frege analyzed a non-mathematical\npredicate like \u2018is happy\u2019 as signifying a function of one\nvariable which maps its arguments to a truth-value. Thus, \u2018is\nhappy\u2019 denotes a concept which can be represented in the formal\nsystem as \u2018\\(H(\\:)\\)\u2019. \\(H(\\:)\\) maps those arguments\nwhich are happy to The True, and maps everything else to The\nFalse. The sentence \u2018John is happy\u2019, represented as\n\u2018\\(H(j)\\)\u2019, is thereby analyzed as: the object denoted by\n\u2018John\u2019 falls under the concept signified by\n\u2018\\((\\:)\\) is happy\u2019. Thus, a simple predication is\nanalyzed in terms of falling under a concept, which in turn, is\nanalyzed in terms of functions which map their arguments to truth\nvalues. By contrast, in the modern predicate calculus, this last step\nof analyzing predication in terms of functions is not assumed;\npredication is seen as more fundamental than functional application.\nThe sentence \u2018John is happy\u2019 is formally represented as\n\u2018\\(Hj\\)\u2019, where this is a basic form of predication\n(\u2018the object \\(j\\) instantiates or exemplifies the property\n\\(H\\)\u2019). In the modern predicate calculus, functional\napplication is analyzable in terms of predication, as we shall soon\nsee.\n\n\nIn Frege\u2019s analysis, the verb phrase \u2018loves\u2019\nsignifies a binary function of two variables: \\(L((\\:),(\\:))\\). This\nfunction takes a pair of arguments \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) and maps them to\nThe True if \\(x\\) loves \\(y\\) and maps all other pairs of arguments to\nThe False. Although it is a descendent of Frege\u2019s system, the\nmodern predicate calculus analyzes loves as a two-place\nrelation (written: \\(Lxy\\)) rather than a function; some objects stand\nin the relation and others do not. The difference between\nFrege\u2019s understanding of predication and the one manifested by\nthe modern predicate calculus is simply this: in the modern predicate\ncalculus, relations are taken as basic, and functions are defined as a\nspecial case of relation, namely, those relations \\(R\\) such that for\nany objects \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\), if \\(Rxy\\) and \\(Rxz\\), then\n\\(y=z\\). By contrast, Frege took functions to be more basic than\nrelations. His logic is based on functional application rather than\npredication; a binary relation is analyzed as a binary function that\nmaps a pair of arguments to a truth-value.  Thus, a 3-place relation\nlike gives would be analyzed in Frege\u2019s logic as a\nfunction that maps arguments \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) to an appropriate\ntruth-value depending on whether \\(x\\) gives \\(y\\) to \\(z\\); the\n4-place relation buys would be analyzed as a function that\nmaps the arguments \\(x\\), \\(y\\), \\(z\\), and \\(u\\) to an appropriate\ntruth-value depending on whether \\(x\\) buys \\(y\\) from \\(z\\) for\namount \\(u\\); etc.\n2.2 Complex Statements and Generality\n\n So far, we have been discussing Frege\u2019s analysis of\n\u2018atomic\u2019 statements. To complete the basic logical\nrepresentation of thoughts, Frege added notation for representing more\ncomplex statements (such as negated and conditional statements) and\nstatements of generality (those involving the expressions\n\u2018every\u2019 and \u2018some\u2019). Though we no longer use\nhis notation for representing complex and general statements, it is\nimportant to see how the notation in Frege\u2019s term logic already\ncontained all the expressive power of the modern predicate calculus.\n\n\n\nThere are four special functional expressions which are used in\nFrege\u2019s system to express complex and general statements:\n\n\nIntuitive Significance\nFunctional Expression\nThe Function It Signifies\n\n\nStatement\n\nThe function which maps The True to The True and maps all other\nobjects to The False; used to express the thought that the argument of\nthe function is a true statement.\n\n\nNegation\n\nThe function which maps The True to The False and maps all other\nobjects to The True\n\n\nConditional\n\nThe function which maps a pair of objects to The False if the first\n(i.e., named in the bottom branch) is The True and the second\nisn\u2019t The True, and maps all other pairs of objects to The True\n\n\nGenerality\n\nThe second-level function which maps a first-level concept\n\u03a6 to The True if \u03a6 maps every object\nto The True; otherwise it maps \u03a6 to The False.\n\n\n\n\nThe best way to understand this notation is by way of some tables,\nwhich show some specific examples of statements and how those are\nrendered in Frege\u2019s notation and in the modern predicate\ncalculus.\n2.2.1 Truth-functional Connectives\n\n The first table shows how Frege\u2019s logic can express the\ntruth-functional connectives such as not, if-then, and, or, and\nif-and-only-if. \n\n\nExample\nFrege\u2019sNotation\nModernNotation\n\n\nJohn is happy\n\n\\(Hj\\)\n\n\nIt is not the case that John is happy\n\n\\(\\neg Hj\\)\n\n\nIf the sun is shining, then John is happy\n\n\\(Ss \\to Hj\\)\n\n\nThe sun is shining and John is happy\n\n\\(Ss \\amp Hj\\)\n\n\nEither the sun is shining or John is happy\n\n\\(Ss \\lor Hj\\)\n\n\nThe sun is shining if and only if John is happy\n\n\\(Ss \\equiv Hj\\)\n\n\n\n\nAs one can see, Frege didn\u2019t use the primitive connectives\n\u2018and\u2019, \u2018or\u2019, or \u2018if and only if\u2019,\nbut always used canonical equivalent forms defined in terms of\nnegations and conditionals. Note the last row of the table \u2014\nwhen Frege wants to assert that two conditions are materially\nequivalent, he uses the identity sign, since this says that they\ndenote the same truth-value. In the modern sentential calculus, the\nbiconditional does something equivalent, for a statement of the form\n\\(\\phi \\equiv \\psi\\) is true whenever \\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\psi\\) are both\ntrue or both false. The only difference is, in the modern sentential\ncalculus \\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\psi\\) are not construed as terms denoting\ntruth-values, but rather as sentences having truth conditions. Of\ncourse, Frege could, in his notation, use the sentence \u2018\\((\\phi\n\\to \\psi) \\amp (\\psi \\to \\phi)\\)\u2019 to assert \\(\\phi \\equiv\n\\psi\\).\n2.2.2 Quantified Statements\n\n\nThe table below compares statements of generality in Frege\u2019s notation\nand in the modern predicate calculus. Frege used a special typeface\n(Gothic) for variables in general statements.\n\n\nExample\nFregeNotation\nModernNotation\n\n\nEverything is mortal\n\n\\(\\forall xMx\\)\n\n\nSomething is mortal\n\n\\(\\neg \\forall x\\neg Mx\\)\ni.e., \\(\\exists xMx\\)\n\n\nNothing is mortal\n\n\\(\\forall x \\neg Mx\\)  i.e., \\(\\neg \\exists\nxMx\\)\n\n\nEvery person is mortal\n\n\\(\\forall x(Px \\to Mx)\\)\n\n\nSome person is mortal\n\n\\(\\neg\\forall x(Px \\to \\neg Mx)\\)  i.e.,\n\\(\\exists x(Px \\amp Mx)\\)\n\n\nNo person is mortal\n\n\\(\\forall x(Px \\to \\neg Mx)\\) \ni.e., \\(\\neg \\exists x(Px \\amp Mx)\\)\n\n\nAll and only persons are mortal\n\n\\(\\forall x(Px \\equiv Mx)\\)\n\n\n\n\nNote the last line. Here again, Frege uses the identity sign to help\nstate the material equivalence of two concepts. He can do this because\nmaterially equivalent concepts \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) are such that \\(F\\)\nmaps an object \\(x\\) to The True whenever \\(G\\) maps \\(x\\) to The\nTrue; i.e., for all arguments \\(x\\), \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) map \\(x\\) to the\nsame truth-value.\n\n\nIn the modern predicate calculus, the symbols\n\u2018\\(\\forall\\)\u2019 (\u2018every\u2019) and\n\u2018\\(\\exists\\)\u2019 (\u2018some\u2019) are called the\n\u2018universal\u2019 and \u2018existential\u2019 quantifier,\nrespectively, and the variable \u2018\\(x\\)\u2019 in the sentence\n\u2018\\(\\forall xMx\\)\u2019 is called a \u2018quantified\nvariable\u2019, or \u2018variable bound by the quantifier\u2019. We\nwill follow this practice of calling statements involving one of these\nquantifier phrases \u2018quantified statements\u2019. As one can see\nfrom the table above, Frege didn\u2019t use an existential\nquantifier. He was aware that a statement of the form \u2018\\(\\exists\nx\\phi \\)\u2019 could always be defined as \u2018\\(\\neg \\forall x\n\\neg \\phi\\)\u2019, where \\(\\phi\\) is any formula.\n\n\nIt is important to mention here that the predicate calculus\nformulable in Frege\u2019s logic is a \u2018second-order\u2019 predicate\ncalculus. This means it allows quantification over functions as well as\nquantification over objects; i.e., statements of the form \u2018Every\nfunction \\(f\\) is such that \u2026\u2019 and \u2018Some function\n\\(f\\) is such that \u2026\u2019 are allowed. Thus, the statement\n\u2018objects a and b fall under the same\nconcepts\u2019 would be written as follows in Frege\u2019\nnotation:\n\n\n\n\n and in the modern second-order predicate calculus, we write this\nas: \n\n\\(\\forall F (Fa \\equiv Fb) \\)\n\n\nReaders interested in learning more about Frege\u2019s notation can\nconsult Beaney (1997, Appendix 2), Furth (1967), Reck & Awodey\n(2004, 26\u201334), and Cook (2013). In what follows, however, we\nshall continue to use the notation of the modern predicate calculus\ninstead of Frege\u2019s notation. In particular, we adopt the\nfollowing conventions:\n\nWe shall often use \u2018\\(Fx\\)\u2019 instead of\n\u2018\\(F(x)\\)\u2019 to represent the fact that \\(x\\) falls under\nthe concept \\(F\\); we use \u2018\\(Rxy\\)\u2019 instead of\n\u2018\\(R(x,y)\\)\u2019 to represent the fact that \\(x\\) stands in\nthe relation \\(R\\) to \\(y\\); etc.\nInstead of using expressions with placeholders, such as\n\u2018\\((\\:) = (\\:)\\)\u2019 and \u2018\\(P(\\:)\\)\u2019, to signify\nfunctions and concepts, we shall simply use \u2018\\(=\\)\u2019 and\n\u2018\\(P\\)\u2019.\nWhen one replaces one of the complete names in a sentence by a\nvariable, the resulting expression will be called an open\nsentence or an open formula. Thus, whereas \u2018\\(3 <\n2\\)\u2019 is a sentence, \u2018\\(3 < x\\)\u2019 is an open sentence;\nand whereas \u2018\\(Hj\\)\u2019 is a formal sentence that might be\nused to represent \u2018John is happy\u2019, the expression\n\u2018\\(Hx\\)\u2019 is an open formula which might be rendered\n\u2018\\(x\\) is happy\u2019 in natural language.\nFinally, we shall on occasion employ the Greek symbol \\(\\phi\\) as\na metavariable ranging over formal sentences, which may or may not be\nopen. Thus, \u2018\\(\\phi (a)\\)\u2019 will be used to indicate any\nsentence (simple or complex) in which the name \u2018\\(a\\)\u2019\nappears; \u2018\\(\\phi(a)\\)\u2019 is not to be understood as\nFrege-notation for a function \\(\\phi\\) applied to argument \\(a\\).\nSimilarly, \u2018\\(\\phi(x)\\)\u2019 will be used to indicate an open\nsentence in which the variable \\(x\\) may or may not be free, not a\nfunction of \\(x\\).\n\n\nAgain, it should be noted that the foregoing has been a simplified\npresentation of Frege\u2019s logic, for those who are encountering it for\nthe first time.  With these basics in hand, see the entry on \nFrege\u2019s logic for a more precise\npresentation.\n2.2.3 Frege\u2019s Logic of Quantification\n\n\nFrege\u2019s functional analysis of predication coupled with his\nunderstanding of generality freed him from the limitations of the\n\u2018subject-predicate\u2019 analysis of ordinary language sentences\nthat formed the basis of Aristotelian logic and it made it possible for\nhim to develop a more general treatment of inferences involving\n\u2018every\u2019 and \u2018some\u2019. In traditional Aristotelian\nlogic, the subject of a sentence and the direct object of a verb are\nnot on a logical par. The rules governing the inferences between\nstatements with different but related subject terms are different from\nthe rules governing the inferences between statements with different\nbut related verb complements. For example, in Aristotelian logic, the\nrule which permits the valid inference from \u2018John loves\nMary\u2019 to \u2018Something loves Mary\u2019 is different from the\nrule which permits the valid inference from \u2018John loves\nMary\u2019 to \u2018John loves something\u2019. The rule governing\nthe first inference is a rule which applies only to subject terms\nwhereas the rule governing the second inference governs reasoning\nwithin the predicate, and thus applies only to the transitive verb\ncomplements (i.e., direct objects). In Aristotelian logic, these\ninferences have nothing in common.\n\n\nIn Frege\u2019s logic, however, a single rule governs both the\ninference from \u2018John loves Mary\u2019 to \u2018Something loves\nMary\u2019 and the inference from \u2018John loves Mary\u2019 to\n\u2018John loves something\u2019. That\u2019s because the subject\nJohn and the direct object Mary are both considered on a logical par,\nas arguments of the function loves. In effect, Frege saw no\nlogical difference between the subject \u2018John\u2019 and the\ndirect object \u2018Mary\u2019. What is logically important is that\n\u2018loves\u2019 denotes a function of two arguments. No matter\nwhether the quantified expression \u2018something\u2019 appears as\nsubject (\u2018Something loves Mary\u2019) or within a predicate\n(\u2018John loves something\u2019), it is to be resolved in the same\nway. In effect, Frege treated these quantified expressions as\nvariable-binding operators. The variable-binding operator \u2018some\n\\(x\\) is such that\u2019 can bind the variable \u2018\\(x\\)\u2019 in\nthe open sentence \u2018\\(x\\) loves Mary\u2019 as well as the\nvariable \u2018\\(x\\)\u2019 in the open sentence \u2018John loves\n\\(x\\)\u2019. Thus, Frege analyzed the above inferences in the\nfollowing general way:\n\nJohn loves Mary. Therefore, some \\(x\\) is such that \\(x\\)\nloves Mary.\nJohn loves Mary. Therefore, some \\(x\\) is such that John loves\n\\(x\\).\n\n\n\nBoth inferences are instances of a single valid inference rule. To\nsee this more clearly, here are the formal representations of the above\ninformal arguments:\n\n\\(Ljm\\) \u2234 \\(\\exists x (Lxm)\\)\n\\(Ljm\\) \u2234 \\(\\exists x (Ljx)\\)\n\n\n\nThe logical axiom which licenses both inferences has the form:\n\n\\(Ra_1 \\ldots a_i \\ldots a_n \\to \\exists x(Ra_1 \\ldots x \\ldots\na_n)\\),\n\n where \\(R\\) is a relation that can take \\(n\\) arguments, \\(a_1,\n\\ldots , a_n\\) are any constants (names), and \\(1 \\leq i \\leq\nn\\). This logical axiom tells us that from a simple predication\ninvolving an \\(n\\)-place relation, one can existentially generalize on\nany argument, and validly derive a existential statement. \n\n\nIndeed, this axiom can be made even more general. If \\(\\phi (a)\\) is\nany statement (formula) in which a constant (name) \\(a\\) appears, and\n\\(\\phi (x)\\) is the result of replacing one or more occurrences of\n\\(a\\) by \\(x\\), then the following is a logical axiom:\n\n\\(\\phi (a) \\to \\exists x \\phi (x)\\)\n\n\n The inferences which start with the premise \u2018John loves\nMary\u2019, displayed above, both appeal to this axiom for\njustification. This axiom is actually derivable as a theorem from\nFrege\u2019s Basic Law IIa (1893, \u00a747). Basic Law IIa is\nformulated as \\(\\forall x\\phi (x) \\to \\phi (a)\\), where \\(\\phi(a)\\) is\nthe result of substituting \\(a\\) for one or more variables \\(x\\) bound\nby the quantifier (though see below for a more careful discussion of\nthis axiom). So the axiom displayed above for the existential\nquantifier can be derived from IIa using the rules governing\nconditionals, negation, and the definition of \\(\\exists x\\phi\\)\ndiscussed above. \n\n\nThere is one other consequence of Frege\u2019s logic of\nquantification that should be mentioned. Frege took claims of the form\n\\(\\exists x\\phi\\) to be existence claims. He suggested that\nexistence is not a concept under which objects fall but\nrather a second-level concept under which first-level concepts fall. A\nconcept \\(F\\) falls under this second-level concept just in case \\(F\\)\nmaps at least one object to The True. So the claim \u2018Martians\ndon\u2019t exist\u2019 is analyzed as an assertion about the\nconcept martian, namely, that nothing falls under it.  Frege\ntherefore took existence to be that second-level concept\nwhich maps a first-level concept \\(F\\) to The True just in case\n\\(\\exists xFx\\). Some philosophers have thought that this analysis\nvalidates Kant\u2019s view that existence is not a (real)\npredicate.\n2.3 Proof and Definition\n2.3.1 Proof\n\n\nFrege\u2019s system (i.e., his term logic/predicate calculus) consisted\nof a language and an apparatus for proving statements. The latter\nconsisted of a set of logical axioms (statements considered to be\ntruths of logic) and a set of rules of inference that lay out the\nconditions under which certain statements of the language may be\ncorrectly inferred from others. Frege made a point of showing how every\nstep in a proof of a proposition was justified either in terms of one\nof the axioms or in terms of one of the rules of inference or justified\nby a theorem or derived rule that had already been proved.\n\n\nThus, as part of his formal system, Frege developed a strict\nunderstanding of a \u2018proof\u2019. In essence, he defined a proof\nto be any finite sequence of statements such that each statement in the\nsequence either is an axiom or follows from previous members by a valid\nrule of inference. Thus, a proof of a theorem of logic, say \u03c6, is\ntherefore any finite sequence of statements (with \u03c6 the final\nstatement in the sequence) such that each member of the sequence: (a)\nis one of the logical axioms of the formal system, or (b) follows from\nprevious members of the sequence by a rule of inference. These are\nessentially the definitions that logicians still use today.\n2.3.2 Definition\n\n\nFrege was extremely careful about the proper description and\ndefinition of logical and mathematical concepts. He developed powerful\nand insightful criticisms of mathematical work which did not meet his\nstandards for clarity. For example, he criticized mathematicians who\ndefined a variable to be a number that varies rather than an expression\nof language which can vary as to which determinate number it may take\nas a value.\nMore importantly, however, Frege was the first to claim that a\nproperly formed definition had to have two important metatheoretical\nproperties.  Let us call the new, defined symbol introduced in a\ndefinition the definiendum, and the term that is used to\ndefine the new term the definiens.  Then Frege was the first\nto suggest that proper definitions have to be both eliminable\n(a definendum must always be replaceable by its definiens in any\nformula in which the former occurs) and conservative (a\ndefinition should not make it possible to prove new relationships\namong formulas that were formerly unprovable).  Concerning one of his\ndefinitions in the Begriffsschrift (\u00a724), Frege\nwrites: \nWe can do without the notation introduced by this\n  sentence, and hence without the sentence itself as its definition;\n  nothing follows from the sentence that could not also be inferred\n  without it. Our sole purpose in introducing such definitions is to\n  bring about an extrinsic simplification by stipulating an\n  abbreviation.\n\nFrege later criticized those mathematicians who developed\n\u2018piecemeal\u2019 definitions or \u2018creative\u2019\ndefinitions. In the Grundgesetze der Arithmetik, II (1903,\nSections 56\u201367) Frege criticized the practice of defining a\nconcept on a given range of objects and later redefining the concept\non a wider, more inclusive range of objects. Frequently, this\n\u2018piecemeal\u2019 style of definition led to conflict, since the\nredefined concept did not always reduce to the original concept when\none restricts the range to the original class of objects. In that same\nwork (1903, Sections 139\u2013147), Frege criticized the mathematical\npractice of introducing notation to name (unique) entities without\nfirst proving that there exist (unique) such entities. He pointed out\nthat such \u2018creative definitions\u2019 were simply unjustified.\nCreative definitions fail to be conservative, as this was explained\nabove. \n2.4 Courses-of-Values, Extensions, and Proposed Mathematical Foundations\n2.4.1 Courses-of-Values and Extensions\n\n\nFrege\u2019s ontology consisted of two fundamentally different types of\nentities, namely, functions and objects (1891, 1892b, 1904). Functions\nare in some sense \u2018unsaturated\u2019; i.e., they are the kind of\nthing which take objects as arguments and map those arguments to a\nvalue. This distinguishes them from objects. As we\u2019ve seen, the domain\nof objects included two special objects, namely, the truth-values The\nTrue and The False.\n\n\nIn his work of 1893/1903, Frege attempted to expand the domain of\nobjects by systematically associating, with each function \\(f\\), an\nobject which he called the course-of-values of \\(f\\). The\ncourse-of-values of a function is a record of the value of the function\nfor each argument. The principle Frege used to systematize\ncourses-of-values is Basic Law V (1893/\u00a720;):\nThe course-of-values of the concept \\(f\\) is identical to\nthe course-of-values of the concept \\(g\\) if and only if \\(f\\) and\n\\(g\\) agree on the value of every argument (i.e., if and only if for\nevery object \\(x\\), \\(f(x) = g(x)\\)).\n\n\nFrege used the a Greek epsilon with a smooth breathing mark above it\nas part of the notation for signifying the course-of-values of\nthe function \\(f\\):\n\n\\(\\stackrel{,}{\\varepsilon}\\!\\!f(\\varepsilon)\\) \n\n\n\nwhere the first occurrence of the Greek \\(\\varepsilon\\) (with the\nsmooth breathing mark above it) is a \u2018variable-binding\noperator\u2019 which we might read as \u2018the course-of-values\nof\u2019. To avoid the appearance of variable clash, we may also use\na Greek \\(\\alpha\\) (also with a smooth breathing mark above) as a\nvariable-binding operator. Using this notation, Frege formally\nrepresented Basic Law V in his system as:\n\nBasic Law V  \n\\(\n\\stackrel{,}{\\varepsilon}\\!\\!f(\\varepsilon) =\n\\, \\stackrel{,}{\\alpha}\\!g(\\alpha) \\equiv \\forall x(f(x) = g(x))\n\\)\n\n\n\n(Actually, Frege used an identity sign instead of the biconditional\nas the main connective of this principle, for reasons described\nabove.)\n\n\nFrege called the course-of-values of a concept \\(F\\) its\nextension. The extension of a concept \\(F\\) records just\nthose objects which \\(F\\) maps to The True. Thus Basic Law V applies\nequally well to the extensions of concepts. Let\n\u2018\\(\\phi(x)\\)\u2019 be an open sentence of any complexity with\nthe free variable \\(x\\) (the variable \\(x\\) may have more than one\noccurrence in \\(\\phi(x)\\), but for simplicity, assume it has only one\noccurrence). Then Frege would use the expression:\n\n\\(\\stackrel{,}{\\varepsilon}\\!\\! \\phi (\\varepsilon)\\),\n\n\nwhere the second epsilon replaces \\(x\\) in \\(\\phi (x)\\), to denote the\nextension of the concept \\(\\phi\\).  Where \u2018\\(n\\)\u2019 is the\nname of an object, Frege could define \u2018object \\(n\\) is an\nelement of the extension of the concept \\(\\phi\\)\u2019 in the\nfollowing simple terms: \u2018the concept \\(\\phi\\) maps \\(n\\) to The\nTrue\u2019, i.e., \\(\\phi(n)\\). For example, the number \\(3\\) is an\nelement of the extension of the concept\nodd number greater than \\(2\\) if and only if this concept\nmaps \\(3\\) to The True.\n\n\nUnfortunately, Basic Law V implies a contradiction, and this was\npointed out to Frege by Bertrand Russell just as the second volume of\nthe Grundgesetze was going to press. Russell recognized that\nsome extensions are elements of themselves and some are not; the\nextension of the concept extension is an element of itself,\nsince that concept would map its own extension to The True. The\nextension of the concept spoon is not an element of itself,\nbecause that concept would map its own extension to The False (since\nextensions aren\u2019t spoons). But now what about the\nconcept extension which is not an element of itself?  Let\n\\(E\\) represent this concept and let \\(e\\) name the extension of\n\\(E\\). Is \\(e\\) an element of itself? Well, \\(e\\) is an element of\nitself if and only if \\(E\\) maps \\(e\\) to The True (by the definition\nof \u2018element of\u2019 given at the end of the previous\nparagraph, where \\(e\\) is the extension of the concept \\(E\\)). But\n\\(E\\) maps \\(e\\) to The True if and only if \\(e\\) is an extension\nwhich is not an element of itself, i.e., if and only if \\(e\\) is not\nan element of itself. We have thus reasoned that \\(e\\) is an element\nof itself if and only if it is not, showing the incoherency in\nFrege\u2019s conception of an extension.\n\n\nFurther discussion of this problem can be found in the entry on\n Russell\u2019s Paradox,\n and a more complete\nexplanation of how the paradox arises in Frege\u2019s system is presented in\nthe entry on\n Frege\u2019s theorem and foundations for arithmetic.\n2.4.2 Proposed Foundation for Mathematics\n\n\nBefore he became aware of Russell\u2019s paradox, Frege attempted to\nconstruct a logical foundation for mathematics. Using the logical\nsystem containing Basic Law V (1893/1903), he attempted to demonstrate\nthe truth of the philosophical thesis known as logicism, i.e.,\nthe idea not only that mathematical concepts can be defined in terms of\npurely logical concepts but also that mathematical principles can be\nderived from the laws of logic alone. But given that the crucial\ndefinitions of mathematical concepts were stated in terms of\nextensions, the inconsistency in Basic Law V undermined Frege\u2019s attempt\nto establish the thesis of logicism. Few philosophers today believe\nthat mathematics can be reduced to logic in the way Frege had in mind.\nMathematical theories such as set theory seem to require some\nnon-logical concepts (such as set membership) which cannot be defined\nin terms of logical concepts, at least when axiomatized by certain\npowerful non-logical axioms (such as the proper axioms of\nZermelo-Fraenkel set theory). Despite the fact that a contradiction\ninvalidated a part of his system, the intricate theoretical web of\ndefinitions and proofs developed in the Grundgesetze\nnevertheless offered philosophical logicians an intriguing conceptual\nframework. The ideas of\n Bertrand Russell\n and\n Alfred North Whitehead\n in\n Principia Mathematica\n owe\na huge debt to the work found in Frege\u2019s Grundgesetze.\n\n\nDespite Frege\u2019s failure to provide a coherent systematization of the\nnotion of an extension, we shall make use of the notion in what follows\nto explain Frege\u2019s theory of numbers and analysis of number statements,\nwithout assuming Basic Law V. It suffices to use our\ninformal understanding of the notion, though extensions can be\nrehabilitated in various ways, either axiomatically as in modern set\ntheory or as in the various ways logicians have found to weaken\nFrege\u2019s system. (See T. Parsons 1987, Burgess 1998, Heck 1996, Wehmeier\n1999, Ferreira & Wehmeier 2002, Fine 2002, Anderson & Zalta\n2004, Ferreira 2005, and Antonelli & May 2005.)\n2.5 The Analysis of Statements of Number\n\n\nIn what has come to be regarded as a seminal treatise, Die\nGrundlagen der Arithmetik (1884), Frege began work on the idea of\nderiving some of the basic principles of arithmetic from what he\nthought were more fundamental logical principles and logical concepts.\nPhilosophers today still find that work insightful. The leading idea\nis that a statement of number, such as \u2018There are eight\nplanets\u2019 and \u2018There are two authors of Principia\nMathematica\u2019, is really a statement about a concept. Frege\nrealized that one and the same physical phenomena could be\nconceptualized in different ways, and that answers to the question\n\u2018How many?\u2019 only make sense once a concept \\(F\\) is\nsupplied. Thus, one and the same physical entity might be\nconceptualized as consisting of \\(1\\) army, \\(5\\) divisions, \\(20\\)\nregiments, \\(100\\) companies, etc., and so the question \u2018How\nmany?\u2019 only becomes legitimate once one supplies the concept\nbeing counted, such as\narmy, division, regiment, or\ncompany (1884, \u00a746).\n\n\nUsing this insight, Frege took true statements like \u2018There are\neight planets\u2019 and \u2018There are two authors of Principia\nMathematica\u2019 to be \u201csecond level\u201d claims about\nthe concepts planet and author of Principia Mathematica,\nrespectively. In the second case, the second level claim asserts that\nthe first-level concept being an author of Principia\nMathematica falls under the second-level concept being a\nconcept under which two objects fall. This sounds circular, since\nit looks like we have analyzed\n\nThere are two authors of Principia Mathematica,\n\n\nwhich involves the concept two, as:\n\nThe concept being an author of Principia Mathematica falls\nunder the concept being a concept under which two objects\nfall,\n\n\n\nwhich also involves the concept two. But despite\nappearances, there is no circularity, since Frege analyzes the\nsecond-order concept being a concept under which two objects\nfall without appealing to the concept two. He did this by\ndefining \u2018\\(F\\) is a concept under which two objects\nfall\u2019, in purely logical terms, as any concept \\(F\\) that\nsatisfies the following condition:\nThere are distinct things \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) that fall under\nthe concept \\(F\\) and anything else that falls under the concept \\(F\\)\nis identical to either \\(x\\) or \\(y\\).\n\n\nIn the notation of the modern predicate calculus, this is formalized\nas:\n\n\\(\\exists x \\exists y (x\\! \\neq\\! y \\amp Fx \\amp Fy \\amp\n\\forall z(Fz \\to z\\! =\\! x \\lor z\\! =\\! y))\\)\n\n\n\nNote that the concept being an author of Principia\nMathematica satisfies this condition, since there are distinct\nobjects \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), namely, Bertrand Russell and Alfred\nNorth Whitehead, who authored Principia Mathematica and who\nare such that anything else authoring Principia Mathematica is\nidentical to one of them. In this way, Frege analyzed a statement of\nnumber (\u2018there are two authors of Principia\nMathematica\u2019) as higher-order logical statements about\nconcepts.\n\n\nFrege then took his analysis one step further. He noticed that each\nof the conditions in the following sequence of conditions defined a\nclass of \u2018equinumerous\u2019 concepts, where\n\u2018F\u2019 in each case is a variable ranging over\nconcepts:\n\n\nCondition (0):\nNothing falls under \\(F\\)  \n \\(\\neg \\exists xFx\\)\n\n\nCondition (1):\nExactly one thing falls under \\(F\\) \n \\(\\exists x(Fx \\amp \\forall y(Fy \\to y\\! =\\! x))\\)\n\n\nCondition (2):\nExactly two things fall under F.\n\n\\(\\exists x \\exists y (x\\! \\neq\\! y \\amp Fx \\amp Fy \\amp\n\\forall z(Fz \\to z\\! =\\! x \\lor z\\! =\\! y))\\)\n\n\n\nCondition (3):\nExactly three things fall under F.  \n\\(\\exists x \\exists y \\exists z (x\\! \\neq\\! y \\amp x\\! \\neq\\! z\n\\amp y\\! \\neq\\! z \\amp Fx \\amp Fy \\amp Fz \\amp\\ \\)\n\\(\\forall w(Fw \\to w\\! =\\! x \\lor w\\! =\\! y \\lor w\\! =\\! z))\\)\n\n\netc.\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that if concepts \\(P\\)  and \\(Q\\) are both concepts\nwhich satisfy one of these conditions, then there is a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between the objects which fall under \\(P\\) and the\nobjects which fall under \\(Q\\). That is, if any of the above\nconditions accurately describes both \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\), then\nevery object falling under \\(P\\) can be paired with a unique and\ndistinct object falling under \\(Q\\) and, under this pairing, every\nobject falling under \\(Q\\) gets paired with some unique and\ndistinct object falling under \\(P\\). (By the logician\u2019s\nunderstanding of the phrase \u2018every\u2019, this last claim even\napplies to those concepts \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) which satisfy\nCondition (0).) Frege would call such \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\)\nequinumerous concepts (1884, \u00a772). Indeed, for each\ncondition defined above, the concepts that satisfy the condition are\nall pairwise equinumerous to one another.\n\n\nWith this notion of equinumerosity, Frege defined \u2018the number of\nthe concept \\(F\\)\u2019 to be the extension consisting of all\nthe concepts that are equinumerous with \\(F\\) (1884, \u00a768).\nTo get started, Frege then defined Zero to be the number of the\nconcept being non-self-identical (1884, \u00a774).  If we use\nthe notation \\(\\#F\\) to represent the number of the concept F,\nand use the \\(\\lambda\\)-notation \\([\\lambda x \\: \\phi]\\) to name the\ncomplex concept being an object x such that \\(\\phi\\), Frege\u2019s\ndefinition of Zero becomes:\n\n  \\(0 =_\\mathit{df} \\#[\\lambda x \\: x \\neq x]\\)\n  \n\nThus, the number 0 becomes defined as the extension of all the\nconcepts equinumerous to the concept not being\nself-identical.  This extension contains all the concepts that\nsatisfy Condition (0) above, and so the number of all such concepts is\n0. For example, the number of the concept being a square\ncircle is \\(0\\), since nothing falls under it. Similarly, one\ncould define the number \\(1\\) as the extension consisting of all the\nconcepts that satisfy Condition (1) above, and define the number \\(2\\)\nas the extension of all the concepts that satisfy Condition (2) above,\nand so on.  But though this would define a sequence of entities which\nare numbers, this procedure doesn\u2019t actually define the\nconcept natural number (finite number).  Frege,\nhowever, had a deep idea about how to do this.\n2.6 Natural Numbers\n\n\nIn order to define the concept of natural number, Frege first\ndefined, for every \\(2\\)-place relation \\(R\\), the general concept\n\u2018\\(x\\) is an ancestor of \\(y\\) in the \\(R\\)-series\u2019. This\nnew relation is called \u2018the ancestral of the relation\n\\(R\\)\u2019. The ancestral of the relation \\(R\\) was first defined in\nFrege\u2019s Begriffsschrift (1879, \u00a726, Proposition\n76; 1884, \u00a779). The intuitive idea is easily grasped if we\nconsider the relation \\(x\\) is the father of \\(y\\). Suppose that \\(a\\)\nis the father of \\(b\\), that \\(b\\) is the father of \\(c\\), and that\n\\(c\\) is the father of \\(d\\). Then Frege\u2019s definition of\n\u2018\\(x\\) is an ancestor of \\(y\\) in the fatherhood-series\u2019\nensures that \\(a\\) is an ancestor of \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(d\\) in this\nseries, that \\(b\\) is an ancestor of \\(c\\) and \\(d\\) in this series,\nand that \\(c\\) is an ancestor of \\(d\\) in this series.\n\n\nMore generally, if given a series of facts of the form \\(aRb\\),\n\\(bRc\\), \\(cRd\\), and so on, Frege showed how to define the relation\n\\(R^*\\), i.e., x is an ancestor of y in the R-series, which\nFrege referred to as: \\(y\\) follows \\(x\\) in the \\(R\\)-series. To\nexploit this definition in the case of natural numbers, Frege had to\ndefine both the relation \\(x\\) precedes \\(y\\) and the\nancestral of this relation, namely, \\(x\\) is an ancestor of\n\\(y\\) in the predecessor-series. He first defined the\nrelational concept \\(x\\) precedes \\(y\\) as follows (1884,\n\u00a776):\n\n\\(x\\) precedes \\(y\\) iff there is a concept \\(F\\) and\nan object \\(z\\) such that: \n\n\n\\(z\\) falls under \\(F\\),\n\\(y\\) is the (cardinal) number of the concept \\(F\\),\nand\n\\(x\\) is the (cardinal) number of the concept object falling\nunder \\(F\\) other than \\(z\\)\n\n\n\n\nIf we again use the notation \\(\\#F\\) to denote the number of \\(F\\)s\nand the \\(\\lambda\\)-notation \\([\\lambda u \\: \\phi]\\) to name the\ncomplex concept being an object \\(u\\) such that\n\\(\\phi\\), Frege\u2019s definition becomes:\n\n \\( \\mathit{Precedes}(x,y) =_\\mathit{df} \n \\exists F \\exists z (Fz \\,\\amp\\, y\\! =\\! \\#F \\,\\amp\\, x\\! =\\!\n \\#[\\lambda u \\: Fu \\amp u\\! \\neq\\! z]) \\)\n\n\n\nTo see the intuitive idea behind this definition, consider how the\ndefinition is satisfied in the case of the number 1 preceding the\nnumber \\(2\\): there is a concept \\(F\\) (e.g., let \\(F\\) =\nbeing an author of Principia Mathematica) and an object \\(z\\)\n(e.g., let \\(z\\) = Alfred North Whitehead) such that:\n\nWhitehead falls under the concept author of Principia\nMathematica,\n\\(2\\) is the (cardinal) number of the concept author of\nPrincipia Mathematica, and\n\\(1\\) is the (cardinal) number of the concept author of\nPrincipia Mathematica other than Whitehead.\n\n\n\nNote that the last conjunct is true because there is exactly 1\nobject (namely, Bertrand Russell) that falls under the concept\nauthor of Principia Mathematica other than Whitehead.\n\n\nThus, Frege has a definition of precedes which applies to the\nordered pairs \\(\\langle 0,1\\rangle\\), \\(\\langle 1,2\\rangle \\),\n\\(\\langle 2,3\\rangle\\), \u2026\u2009. Frege then defined the\nancestral of this relation, namely, \\(x\\) is an ancestor of\n\\(y\\) in the predecessor-series, or\n\\(\\mathit{Precedes}^*\\). Though the exact definition will not be given\nhere, we note that it has the following consequence: from the facts\nthat \\(10\\) precedes \\(11\\) and \\(11\\) precedes \\(12\\), it follows\nthat \\(10\\) precedes\\(^*\\) \\(12\\) in the\npredecessor-series. Note, however, that although\n\\(10\\) precedes\\(^*\\) \\(12\\), \\(10\\) does not\nprecede \\(12\\), for the notion of precedes is that\nof immediately precedes. Note also that by defining the\nancestral of the precedence relation, Frege had in effect defined\n\\(x\\) < \\(y\\) relative to the predecessor-series.\n\n\nRecall that Frege defined the number \\(0\\) as the number of the concept\nbeing non-self-identical, and that \\(0\\) thereby becomes\nidentified with the extension of all concepts which fail to be\nexemplified. Using this definition, Frege then defined (1884,\n\u00a783) natural number as follows:\n\n   \\(x\\) is a number \u00a0=df\u00a0\n    either \\(x\\! =\\! 0\\) or \\(0\\) is an ancestor of \\(x\\) in the\n    predecessor-series\nwhich we might represent formally as:\n\n   \\( \\mathit{Number}(x) =_\\mathit{df} x\\! =\\! 0 \u2228\n    \\mathit{Precedes}^*(0,x)\\)\n\n\n\nIn other words, a natural number is any member of the\npredecessor-series beginning with 0.\n\n\nUsing this definition as a basis, Frege later derived many important\ntheorems of number theory. Philosophers appreciated the importance of\nthis work only relatively recently (C. Parsons 1965, Smiley 1981,\nWright 1983, and Boolos 1987, 1990, 1995). Wright 1983 in particular\nshowed how the Dedekind/Peano axioms for number might be derived from\none of the consistent principles that Frege discussed in 1884, now\nknown as Hume\u2019s Principle (\u201cThe number of \\(F\\)s is equal\nto the number of \\(G\\)s if and only if there is a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between the \\(F\\)s and the \\(G\\)s\u201d). It was\nrecently shown by R. Heck [1993] that, despite the logical\ninconsistency in the system of Frege 1893/1903, Frege himself validly\nderived the Dedekind/Peano axioms from Hume\u2019s\nPrinciple. Although Frege used Basic Law V (which yields an\ninconsistency when added to his second-order logic) to establish\nHume\u2019s Principle, once Hume\u2019s Principle was established,\nthe subsequent derivations of the Dedekind/Peano axioms make no\nfurther essential appeals to Basic Law V.  Following the lead of\nGeorge Boolos, philosophers today call the derivation of the\nDedekind/Peano Axioms from Hume\u2019s Principle \u2018Frege\u2019s\nTheorem\u2019. For a comprehensive introduction to the subtle and\ncomplex logical reasoning involved in this theorem, see the entry\n Frege\u2019s theorem and foundations for\n arithmetic.\n2.7 Frege\u2019s Conception of Logic\n\n\nBefore receiving the famous letter from Bertrand Russell informing him\nof the inconsistency in his system, Frege thought that he had shown\nthat arithmetic is reducible to the truths of logic. It is recognized\ntoday, however, that at best Frege showed that arithmetic is reducible\nto second-order logic extended only by Hume\u2019s Principle. Some\nphilosophers think Hume\u2019s Principle is analytically true (i.e., true\nin virtue of the very meanings of its words), while others resist the\nclaim, and there is an interesting debate on this issue in the\nliterature (see, e.g., Boolos 1997, Wright 1999).\nHowever, for the purposes of this introduction to Frege\u2019s work,\nthere are prior questions on which it is more important to\nfocus. Whereas Frege thought that the truths of arithmetic are\nderivable from analytic truths of logic, Kant thought arithmetic\nprinciples are synthetic, in which case they wouldn\u2019t be derivable\nfrom analytic truths.  Their different conceptions of logic helps to\nexplain why these two philosophers came to such different conclusions.\nIn this section, we therefore turn to the following questions:\n\nHow did Frege\u2019s conception of logic differ from Kant\u2019s?\nIn particular:\nWhat resources (or laws) did Kant and Frege both consider to be\n logical?\nDid Kant and Frege agree about the content and \nsubject matter of logic?\n\nHow did Frege\u2019s conception of logic differ from that of\nlater logicians?\n\n\nAn answer to the first question sets the stage for answering the\nsecond. \n2.7.1 How Frege\u2019s Conception of Logic Differed from Kant\u2019s\n\nOne of the most important differences between Kant and Frege concerns\nthe resources available to logic. Kant\u2019s logic is limited to (a)\nAristotelian term logic with a simple theory of disjunctive and\nhypothetical propositions, and (b) representing inclusion relations\namong concepts (MacFarlane 2002, 26). By contrast, Frege\u2019s logic\nincludes (a) a term-forming operator \\(\\sm{\\varepsilon}\\), which\nallows one to form the singular term\n\\(\\sm{\\varepsilon}f(\\varepsilon)\\) from the function expression\n\\(f(\\xi)\\), and (b) a Rule of Substitution, which allows one to\nsubstitute complex open formulas for free second-order variables in\ntheorems of logic but also allows one to define, and assert the\nexistence of, complex concepts, including concepts defined in terms of\nquantifiers over concepts.  We\u2019ll discuss both of these\nresources below, but first, the discussion needs some context.\n\nThe differences concerning the resources available to logic revolve\naround a key issue, namely, whether the additional resources Frege\nassigns to logic require an appeal to non-logical constructions,\nspecifically to a faculty of \u2018intuition\u2019, that is, an\nextralogical source which presents our minds with phenomena about\nwhich judgments can be formed.  (Recall the discussion above about\nFrege\u2019s early interest in appeals to intuition.)  The debate\nover which resources do and do not require an appeal to intuition is\nan important one. Frege continued a trend started by Bolzano (1817),\nwho eliminated the appeal to intuition in the proof of the\nIntermediate Value Theorem in the calculus (which in its simplest form\nasserts that a continuous function having both positive and negative\nvalues must cross the origin). Bolzano proved this theorem from the\ndefinition of continuity, which had recently been given in terms\nsimilar to the definition of a limit (see Coffa 1991, 27). A Kantian\nmight simply draw a graph of a continuous function which takes values\nabove and below the origin, and thereby \u2018demonstrate\u2019 that\nsuch a function must cross the origin.  But appeal to a graph involves\nan appeal to intuition, and both Bolzano and Frege saw such appeals to\nintuition as potentially introducing logical gaps into a proof. There\nare reasons to be suspicious about such appeals: (1) there are\nfunctions which we can\u2019t graph or otherwise construct for\npresentation to our intuitive faculty, e.g., the function \\(f\\) which\nmaps rational numbers to \\(0\\) and irrational numbers to \\(1\\), or the\nfunctions noted by Weierstrass, which are everywhere continuous but\nnowhere differentiable; (2) once we take certain intuitive notions and\nformalize them in terms of explicit definitions, the formal definition\nmight imply counterintuitive results; and (3) the rules of inference\nfrom statements to constructions and back are not always clear.\n\nFrege dedicated himself to the idea of eliminating appeals to\nintuition in the proofs of the basic propositions of arithmetic.  He\nexplicitly remarked upon this fact in a number of works throughout his\ncareer (1879, Preface/5, Part III/\u00a723; 1884, \u00a7\u00a762, 87;\n1893, \u00a70; and 1903, Appendix). Thus, he would deny Kant\u2019s\ndictum (A51 [B75]), \u2018Without sensibility, no object would be\ngiven to us\u2019, and claim instead that \\(0\\) and \\(1\\) are objects\nbut that they \u2018can\u2019t be given to us in sensation\u2019\n(1884, 101). Frege\u2019s view is that we can understand or grasp\nthem as objects if we (a) define them as extensions of concepts, and\n(b) show that singular terms of the form\n\\(\\sm{\\varepsilon}f(\\varepsilon)\\) can be axiomatized by an analytic\nproposition. (The latter was to be accomplished by Basic Law V, and so\nthe collapse of this law in light of Russell\u2019s paradox\nundermined this part of his plan for avoiding appeals to\nintuition.)\n\nMoreover, philosophers have questioned whether Frege\u2019s Rule of\nSubstitution (Grundgesetze I, 1893, \u00a748, item 9) also\nrequired an appeal to intuition. The Rule of Substitution allows one\nto substitute complex formulas for free second-order variables in\nlogical theorems to produce new logical theorems. Boolos argued (1985,\n336\u2013338) that since Frege\u2019s Rule of Substitution is\nequivalent to a Comprehension Principle for Concepts, it is\nextralogical in character. The Comprehension Principle for Concepts\nasserts \\(\\exists F \\forall x(Fx \\equiv \\phi)\\), provided \\(\\phi\\)\ndoesn\u2019t have a free variable \\(F\\); the proviso blocks the\ninstance \\(\\exists F\\forall x(Fx \\equiv \\neg Fx)\\), from which one can\nquickly derive a contradiction. Thus, the Comprehension Principle for\nConcepts asserts the existence of a concept corresponding to every\nexpressible condition on objects. From Kant\u2019s point of view,\nsuch existence claims were thought to be synthetic and in need of\njustification by the faculty of intuition. So, although it was one of\nFrege\u2019s goals to avoid appeals to the faculty of intuition,\nthere is a question as to whether his system of second-order logic\n(minus Basic Law V), which implies a principle asserting the existence\nof a wide range of concepts, really is limited in its scope to purely\nlogical laws of an analytic nature.\n\nIf we now put aside their differences about logic\u2019s resources\nand the appeal to intuition, there are other ways in which the Kantian\nand Fregean conceptions of logic differ.  Both MacFarlane (2002) and\nLinnebo (2003) point out that one of Kant\u2019s central views about\nlogic is that its axioms and theorems are purely formal in nature\n(i.e., abstracted from all semantic content and concerned only with\nthe forms of judgments) and are applicable across all the\nphysical and mathematical sciences (1781 [1787], A55 [B79], A56 [B80],\nA70 [B95]; and 1800, 15).  And Kant takes the laws of logic to be\nnormative and prescriptive (something one can get wrong), and not just\ndescriptive (1800, 16); they provide constitutive norms of\nthought (MacFarlane 2002, 35; Tolley 2008).  Indeed, Linnebo takes two\ntheses, that logic is formal and provides laws that are constitutive\nnorms of thought, to be distinctive of Kant\u2019s conception\n(Linnebo 2003, 240).\n\nBy contrast, Frege rejects the idea that logic is a purely formal\nenterprise (MacFarlane 2002, 29; Linnebo 2003, 243). He took logic to\nhave its own unique subject matter, which included not only facts\nabout concepts (concerning negation, subsumption, etc.) and identity,\nbut also facts about relations (e.g., their properties and\nancestrals). Frege (1906, 428 [1984, 338]) says:\n\nJust as the concept point belongs to geometry, so logic, too, has its\nown concepts and relations; and it is only in virtue of this that it\ncan have a content. Toward what is thus proper to it, its relation is\nnot at all formal. No science is completely formal; but even\ngravitational mechanics is formal to a certain degree, in so far as\noptical and chemical properties are all the same to it. \u2026 To\nlogic, for example, there belong the following: negation, identity,\nsubsumption, subordination of concepts.\n\nAnd, of course, as we\u2019ve seen, Frege supposed that there is a domain\nof special logical objects (courses of values), among which\nhe defined, and \u2013 until confronted by Russell\u2019s paradox \u2013\ntook himself to have proved facts about, extensions\nand natural numbers (1884, 1893/1903).  Logic, then, is not\npurely formal, from Frege\u2019s point of view, but rather can provide\nsubstantive knowledge of concepts and objects.\n\nThere is some question, however, as to the extent to which Frege took\nlogic to provide constitutive norms of thought.  Linnebo suggests that\nFrege eventually rejected this idea. Though he offers various\narguments for thinking that Frege moved away from the constitutivity\nthesis, his [Linnebo\u2019s] main argument concerns the fact that Frege\nwanted to position Basic Law V as a logical claim, but that Basic Law\nV doesn\u2019t seem to be a constitutive norm of thought (Linnebo 2003,\n247).  This is a persuasive reason, though it does make one wonder\nwhat Frege could have meant, in the second volume\nof Grundgesetze (\u00a7147), when he said, concerning Basic\nLaw V:\n\nIf there are logical objects at all \u2026 then there must also be a\nmeans of apprehending, or recognizing them. This \u2026 is performed\n\u2026 by the fundamental law of logic that permits the\ntransformation of an equality holding generally\n\\([\\forall x(f(x)\\! =\\! g(x))]\\) into an\nequation\n\\([\\sm{\\varepsilon}f(\\varepsilon) = \\sm{\\alpha}g(\\alpha)]\\).\n[Author\u2019s note: the equations in brackets were added for the sake of\nclarity.] \n\nGiven Frege\u2019s commitment to logical objects as part of the\ncontent of logic, the above passage suggests that he might have\nregarded the law which transformed an equality holding generally into\nan equation as a constitutive norm of thought.\n\nBut many Frege scholars are convinced that Frege took the laws of\nlogic to provide constitutive norms of thought (MacFarlane 2002,\nTaschek 2008, Steinberger 2017).  MacFarlane, in particular, argues\nthat Kant and Frege may have agreed that one of the most important\ncharacteristics of logic is its generality, and that this generality\nconsists in the fact that it provides normative rules and\nprescriptions. He notes that \u201c[t]he generality of logic, for\nFrege as for Kant, is a normative generality: logic is\ngeneral in the sense that it provides constitutive norms for\nthought as such, regardless of its subject matter\u201d\n(2002, 35). So, though they may differ as to which principles are\nlogical, there may be at least one point of reconciliation concerning\nhow Kant and Frege conceived of logic. \n2.7.2 How Frege\u2019s Conception Differed from Later Logicians\n\nGiven the constraints of the present entry, we shall not attempt to\ndiscuss this question in any detail; instead, we present only the\nbarest of outlines. After all, modern logicians and philosophers of\nlogic have not yet come to agreement about the proper conception of\nlogic.  Many have a conception of logic that is yet different from\nboth Kant\u2019s and Frege\u2019s, one that was, to some extent,\nanticipated by Bolzano, namely, that logical concepts and laws remain\ninvariant under reinterpretation of the non-logical constants or under\npermutations of the domain of quantification. But since this modern\nconception is still a matter of debate, it may be that elements of\nFrege\u2019s conception will yet play a role in our understanding of\nwhat logic is.\nIt is important to recognize just how much Frege took himself to be\nfocusing on the content, as opposed to the form, of\nthoughts. His concern to more precisely represent the content of\nthoughts is stated explicitly in an 1882 lecture before Jena\u2019s\nSociety for Medicine and Natural Science, where he distinguished his\n1879 system from Boole\u2019s logic by saying:\nI was not trying to present an abstract logic in formulas;\nI was trying to express contents in an exacter and more perspicuous\nmanner than is possible in words, by using written symbols. I was\ntrying, in fact, to create a \u201clingua\ncharacteristica\u201d in the Leibnizian sense, not a mere\n\u201ccalculus ratiocinator\u201d\u2014not that I do not\nrecognize such a deductive calculus as a necessary constituent of a\nBegriffsschrift.  [Frege 1882, V.H. Dudman (trans.)\n1968] \n\nSo Frege was not just trying to develop an abstract reasoning system\nfor the precise derivations of theorems from axioms (see van\nHeijenoort 1967 for discussion).  Frege was at least as interested in\nformalizing the content of reasoning as he was in formulating\nthe rules for deriving a given thought from some group of\nthoughts. Frege would not have regarded the logical axioms of\nhis formal systems as axiom schemata, i.e., as a\nmetalinguistic sentence patterns whose instances (i.e., the sentences\nof the object language that match the pattern) are axioms (see\nGoldfarb 2001 for discussion). Nor would he have agreed that the\nlogical axioms of his system were uninterpreted sentences. His unease\nwith the modern conception of an uninterpreted formal system was\nexpressed in his reaction to Hilbert\u2019s Foundations of\nGeometry (Frege 1906, 384 [1984, 315]):\n\nThe word \u2018interpretation\u2019 is objectionable, for when\nproperly expressed, a thought leaves no room for different\ninterpretations. We have seen that ambiguity simply has to be rejected\n\u2026\n\nInstead, Frege thought that his logical axioms are (a) fundamental\ntruths governing negation, conditionalization, quantification,\nidentity, and description, and (b) principles from which other such\nfundamental truths could be derived. Indeed, even though Frege\nsometimes introduces methods for abbreviating these truths, he takes\ngreat pains to insist that these abbreviations are to be understood in\nterms of the full content being expressed.  For example, he summarizes\nthe law of universal instantiation (Basic Law IIa) in 1893/\u00a747\nusing a formula that we would write nowadays as:\n\n\\(\\forall xFx \\to Fy\\)\n\n\nBut closer inspection of \u00a720, where this principle is first\ndiscussed, and of \u00a717, where he introduces some notational\nconventions used in \u00a720, makes it clear that the above is\nshorthand for:\n\n\\(\\forall F \\forall y(\\forall xFx \\to Fy)\\)\n\n\nThis latter is a sentence; it is not a schema, nor an open formula\nwith a free variable, nor an uninterpreted sentence.  Rather it\nasserts something that Frege takes to be fundamental law, namely: for\nany property \\(F\\) and for any object \\(y\\), if everything\nfalls under \\(F\\), then \\(y\\) falls under \\(F\\).\n\nFrege\u2019s understanding of, and attitude towards, the formulas of\nhis formal language goes a long way towards explaining why his\nposition, in the now famous debate with Hilbert about the status of\nthe axioms in a formal system, is not an unreasonable one. At first\nglance, it looks as if Frege has mistakenly challenged Hilbert\u2019s\nmethod of relative interpretability, whereby one can prove the\nconsistency and independence of axiom systems by re-intepreting, and\nthereby reducing, them to systems assumed to be\nconsistent. Frege\u2019s objections about what exactly has been\nestablished by these relative consistency proofs may seem misguided to\na modern ear.  But since Frege and Hilbert understood the notions\nof consistency and independence differently, they\ndidn\u2019t always directly engage with the other\u2019s ideas.\nBlanchette nicely shows, both in the entry on the\n  Frege-Hilbert controversy and in her\nbook (2012, Ch. 5), that if the notions of consistency and\nindependence are understood Hilbert\u2019s way, then Hilbert\u2019s\nmethods do establish what he says they do, but that if these notions\nare understood Frege\u2019s way, they don\u2019t. The reader should pursue\nthese works for a more detailed explanation and nuanced discussion of\nthe disagreement.\n\nOne can appreciate how Frege and Hilbert might have failed to engage\nwith one another by considering a simple analogy.  Consider the\ninference from \u201c\\(x\\) had a nightmare\u201d to \u201c\\(x\\) had\na dream\u201d and ask the question, is the latter a logical\nconsequence of the former? If one examines the inference purely\nformally, as Hilbert might, then the sentences have the form\n\u2018\\(Fx\\)\u2019 and \u2018\\(Gx\\)\u2019 and the question\nbecomes, does \\(Fx\\) logically imply \\(Gx\\)?  The answer for Hilbert\nwould be \u2018No\u2019, because one can interpret\n\u2018\\(F\\)\u2019 and \u2018\\(G\\)\u2019 in such a way that the\ninference fails, e.g., just assign the standard meaning of\n\u2018dream\u2019 to \u2018\\(F\\)\u2019 and assign the standard\nmeaning of \u2018nightmare\u2019 to \u2018\\(G\\)\u2019, i.e.,\ninterpret \u2018\\(F\\)\u2019 as the property having a dream\nand interpret \u2018\\(G\\)\u2019 as the property having a\nnightmare. This shows that, from this purely formal point of\nview, \u201c\\(x\\) had a nightmare\u201d doesn\u2019t logically\nimply \u201c\\(x\\) had a dream\u201d. (From this purely formal\nviewpoint, one additionally needs the premise \\(\\forall y(Fy \\to Gy)\\)\nto infer \\(Gx\\) from \\(Fx\\).)\n\nAlthough Frege had a formal system in which the open sentence \\(Fx\\)\ndoesn\u2019t logically imply \\(Gx\\), he takes logical consequence to\nbe a relation among thoughts. He wouldn\u2019t answer the\nquestion, of whether one thought is a logical consequence of another,\nsolely by looking at the form of the sentences that express them, but\nrather by looking at the content of those sentences. Given the meaning\n(content) that \u2018nightmare\u2019 and \u2018dream\u2019 in fact\nhave, \u201c\\(x\\) had a dream\u201d is a logical consequence of\n\u201c\\(x\\) had a nightmare\u201d, for having a nightmare,\ni.e., having a bad dream, logically implies having a\ndream. So, for Frege, this would clearly be a case of logical\nconsequence.\n\nThis analogy might help one to see how Frege and Hilbert might differ\nin their approach to questions of consistency and interpretation.  On\nFrege\u2019s view, the consistency of a group of axioms depends on\ncontent, and if the form of these axioms, under logical analysis,\nsufficiently captures their content, this consistency will be\ninherited by their formal representations as well.  Of course, in\nproving consistency, Hilbert was concerned primarily to determine\nwhether an axiom system entailed a contradiction having the form\n\\(\\phi \\amp \\neg \\phi\\).  So, given this formal goal,\nHilbert\u2019s methods are useful and immune to criticism.\n\nBut this brings us to one final issue that is crucial to Frege\u2019s\nconception of logic, namely, the extent to which his formal\nrepresentations capture the content of the claims being\nanalyzed. This issue is relevant because Frege\u2019s primary tool for\nanalyzing the content of a mathematical or philosophical claim is by\nway of representing the content in a system that axiomatizes\nthe fundamental concepts that are needed for the analysis.  This issue\nis the subject of the first half of Blanchette 2012. To see what is at\nstake, we vary the example from the one used in Blanchette 2012\n(24). Frege would represent the arithmetical law:\n\nNo (natural) number precedes zero\n\nin the first instance, as:\n\n \\( \\neg \\exists x(\\mathit{Number}(x) \\amp \\mathit{Precedes}(x,0)) \\)\n\nThen if we substitute Frege\u2019s definitions of\n\\(\\mathit{Number}(x)\\), \\(\\mathit{Precedes}(x,y)\\), and \\(0\\), as\ndescribed in Sections 2.5 and 2.6 above, his representation of the\narithmetical law becomes:\n\n \\(\\neg \\exists x((x\\! =\\! 0 \\lor \\mathit{Precedes}^*(0,x)) \\amp \\\\ \\\n    \\ \\ \\exists F \\exists z(Fz \\amp 0\\! =\\! \\#F \\amp x\\! =\\!\n    \\#[\\lambda u \\: Fu \\amp u \\! \\neq\\! z])) \\)\n\n\nThough the formal representation could be taken further, if we expand\nthe definitions of \\(\\mathit{Precedes}^*\\), \\(\\#F\\), and \\(\\#[\\lambda\nu \\: Fu \\amp u \\!\\neq\\! z]\\), enough has been said to pose the\nquestion: why think that by deriving the formal representation from\nmore fundamental principles, Frege has derived the arithmetic law that\nno natural number precedes Zero?  This question is tackled in some\ndetail in in the early part of Blanchette 2012, which investigates\nFrege\u2019s understanding of conceptual analysis. Her answer\n(Chapter 4) is that the formal representation of the arithmetic law\nhas to be (self-evidently) logically equivalent to a good analysis of\nthe original. If it is, then notwithstanding Frege\u2019s failed\nreduction of numbers to extensions, a derivation of the formal\nrepresentation from more general logical laws of the kind represented\nin his system would have in fact achieved the goal of reducing\narithmetic to logic. The reader is directed to her work for discussion\nof this important point.\n3. Frege\u2019s Philosophy of Language\n\n\nWhile pursuing his investigations into mathematics and logic (and\nquite possibly, in order to ground those investigations), Frege was\nled to develop a philosophy of language. His philosophy of language\nhas had just as much, if not more, impact than his contributions to\nlogic and mathematics. However, Bobzien (2021) offers compelling\ndocumentation suggesting that significant elements of Frege\u2019s\nphilosophy of language were adapted from Stoic logic.  In this\nsection, therefore, we first rehearse a key element of Frege\u2019s\nphilosophy of language, namely, the distinction between sense\nand denotation.  To motivate this distinction, we go through\nthe two key puzzles Frege attempted to solve (Section 3.1) and then\nexamine how the distinction between the sense and denotation of terms\n(and sentences) solve these puzzles (Section 3.2). Finally, we attempt\nto put Frege\u2019s philosophy of language in context (Section 3.3), in\nlight of new research arguing for the significant influence that\n(discussions of) Stoic texts had on his ideas.\n3.1 Frege\u2019s Puzzles\n\nFrege\u2019s seminal paper in the philosophy of language is\n\u2018\u00dcber Sinn und Bedeutung\u2019 (\u2018On Sense and\nReference\u2019, 1892a). In this paper, Frege considered two puzzles\nabout language and noticed, in each case, that one cannot account for\nthe meaningfulness or logical behavior of certain sentences simply on\nthe basis of the denotations of the terms (names and descriptions) in\nthe sentence. One puzzle concerned identity statements and the other\nconcerned sentences with subordinate clauses such as propositional\nattitude reports. To solve these puzzles, Frege suggested that the\nterms of a language have both a sense and a denotation, i.e., that at\nleast two semantic relations are required to explain the significance\nor meaning of the terms of a language. This idea has inspired research\nin the field for over a century and we discuss it in what follows.\n(See Heck and May 2006 for further discussion of Frege\u2019s\ncontribution to the philosophy of language.)\n3.1.1 Frege\u2019s Puzzle About Identity Statements\n\n\nHere are some examples of identity statements:\n\\(117+136 = 253\\).\n\n The morning star is identical to the evening star.\n\n Mark Twain is Samuel Clemens.\n\n Bill is Debbie\u2019s father.\n\n\nFrege believed that these statements all have the form\n\u2018\\(a=b\\)\u2019, where \u2018\\(a\\)\u2019 and\n\u2018\\(b\\)\u2019 are either names or descriptions that\ndenote individuals. He naturally assumed that a sentence of\nthe form \u2018\\(a=b\\)\u2019 is true if and only if the object \\(a\\)\njust is (identical to) the object \\(b\\). For example, the sentence\n\u2018\\(117+136 = 253\\)\u2019 is true if and only if the number \\(117+136\\)\njust is the number \\(253\\). And the statement \u2018Mark Twain is Samuel\nClemens\u2019 is true if and only if the person Mark Twain just is\nthe person Samuel Clemens.\n\n\nBut Frege noticed (1892a) that this account of truth can\u2019t be\nall there is to the meaning of identity statements. The statement\n\u2018\\(a=a\\)\u2019 has a cognitive significance (or meaning) that\nmust be different from the cognitive significance of\n\u2018\\(a=b\\)\u2019. We can learn that \u2018Mark Twain = Mark\nTwain\u2019 is true simply by inspecting it; but we can\u2019t learn\nthe truth of \u2018Mark Twain = Samuel Clemens\u2019 simply by\ninspecting it \u2014 you have to examine the world to see whether the\ntwo persons are the same. Similarly, whereas you can learn that\n\u2018\\(117+136 = 117+136\\)\u2019 and \u2018the morning star is\nidentical to the morning star\u2019 are true simply by inspection,\nyou can\u2019t learn the truth of \u2018\\(117+136 = 253\\)\u2019 and\n\u2018the morning star is identical to the evening star\u2019 simply\nby inspection. In the latter cases, you have to do some arithmetical\nwork or astronomical investigation to learn the truth of these\nidentity claims. Now the problem becomes clear: the meaning of\n\u2018\\(a=a\\)\u2019 clearly differs from the meaning of\n\u2018\\(a=b\\)\u2019, but given the account of the truth described in\nthe previous paragraph, these two identity statements appear to have\nthe same meaning whenever they are true! For example, \u2018Mark\nTwain = Mark Twain\u2019 is true just in case: the person Mark Twain is\nidentical with the person Mark Twain. And \u2018Mark Twain = Samuel\nClemens\u2019 is true just in case: the person Mark Twain is\nidentical with the person Samuel Clemens. But given that Mark Twain\njust is Samuel Clemens, these two cases are the same case, and that\ndoesn\u2019t explain the difference in meaning between the two\nidentity sentences. And something similar applies to all the other\nexamples of identity statements having the forms\n\u2018\\(a=a\\)\u2019 and \u2018\\(a=b\\)\u2019.\n\n\nSo the puzzle Frege discovered is: how do we account for the\ndifference in cognitive significance between \u2018\\(a=b\\)\u2019 and\n\u2018\\(a=a\\)\u2019 when they are true?\n3.1.2 Frege\u2019s Puzzle About Propositional Attitude Reports\n\n\nFrege is generally credited with identifying the following puzzle\nabout propositional attitude reports, even though he didn\u2019t quite\ndescribe the puzzle in the terms used below. A propositional attitude\nis a psychological relation between a person and a proposition. Belief,\ndesire, intention, discovery, knowledge, etc., are all psychological\nrelationships between persons, on the one hand, and propositions, on\nthe other. When we report the propositional attitudes of others, these\nreports all have a similar logical form:\n\n \\(x\\) believes that \\(p\\)\n\n \\(x\\) desires that \\(p\\)\n\n \\(x\\) intends that \\(p\\)\n\n \\(x\\) discovered that \\(p\\)\n\n \\(x\\) knows that \\(p\\)\n\n\n\nIf we replace the variable \u2018\\(x\\)\u2019 by the name of a person\nand replace the variable \u2018\\(p\\)\u2019 with a sentence that\ndescribes the propositional object of their attitude, we get specific\nattitude reports. So by replacing \u2018\\(x\\)\u2019 by\n\u2018John\u2019 and \u2018\\(p\\)\u2019 by \u2018Mark Twain\nwrote Huckleberry Finn\u2019 in the first example, the\nresult would be the following specific belief report:\n\n John believes that Mark Twain wrote Huckleberry Finn.\n\n\n\nTo see the problem posed by the analysis of propositional attitude\nreports, consider what appears to be a simple principle of reasoning,\nnamely, the Principle of Identity Substitution (this is not to be\nconfused with the Rule of Substitution discussed earlier). If a name,\nsay \\(n\\), appears in a true sentence \\(S\\), and the identity sentence\n\\(n=m\\) is true, then the Principle of Identity Substitution tells us\nthat the substitution of the name \\(m\\) for the name \\(n\\) in \\(S\\)\ndoes not affect the truth of \\(S\\). For example, let \\(S\\) be the true\nsentence \u2018Mark Twain was an author\u2019, let\n\\(n\\) be the name \u2018Mark Twain\u2019, and let \\(m\\) be\nthe name \u2018Samuel Clemens\u2019. Then since the identity\nsentence \u2018Mark Twain = Samuel Clemens\u2019 is true, we can\nsubstitute \u2018Samuel Clemens\u2019 for \u2018Mark Twain\u2019\nwithout affecting the truth of the sentence. And indeed, the resulting\nsentence \u2018Samuel Clemens was an author\u2019 is true. In other\nwords, the following argument is valid:\n\n Mark Twain was an author.\n\n Mark Twain = Samuel Clemens.\n\n Therefore, Samuel Clemens was an author.\n\n\nSimilarly, the following argument is valid.\n\n \\(4 \\gt 3\\)\n\n \\(4 = 8/2\\)\n\nTherefore, \\(8/2 \\gt 3\\)\n\n\n\nIn general, then, the Principle of Identity Substitution seems to take\nthe following form, where \\(S\\) is a sentence, \\(n\\) and \\(m\\) are\nnames, and \\(S(n)\\) differs from \\(S(m)\\) only by the fact\nthat at least one occurrence of \\(m\\) replaces \\(n\\):\n\nFrom \\(S(n)\\) and \\(n=m\\), infer \\(S(m)\\).\n\n\n\nThis principle seems to capture the idea that if we say something\ntrue about an object, then even if we change the name by which we refer\nto that object, we should still be saying something true about that\nobject.\n\n\nBut Frege, in effect, noticed the following counterexample to the\nPrinciple of Identity Substitution. Consider the following\nargument:\n\n John believes that Mark Twain wrote Huckleberry Finn.\n\n Mark Twain = Samuel Clemens.\n\n Therefore, John believes that Samuel Clemens wrote Huckleberry\nFinn.\n\n\n\nThis argument is not valid. There are circumstances in which the\npremises are true and the conclusion false. We have already described\nsuch circumstances, namely, one in which John learns the name\n\u2018Mark Twain\u2019 by reading Huckleberry Finn but\nlearns the name \u2018Samuel Clemens\u2019 in the context of learning\nabout 19th century American authors (without learning that the name\n\u2018Mark Twain\u2019 was a pseudonym for Samuel Clemens). John may\nnot believe that Samuel Clemens wrote Huckleberry\nFinn. The premises of the above argument, therefore, do not\nlogically entail the conclusion. So the Principle of Identity\nSubstitution appears to break down in the context of propositional\nattitude reports.  The puzzle, then, is to say what causes the\nprinciple to fail in these contexts. Why aren\u2019t we still saying\nsomething true about the man in question if all we have done is\nchanged the name by which we refer to him?\n3.2 Frege\u2019s Theory of Sense and Denotation\n\n\nTo explain these puzzles, Frege suggested (1892a) that in addition to\nhaving a denotation, names and descriptions also express a\n sense.[5] \n The sense of an expression accounts for its\ncognitive significance\u2014it is the way by which one conceives of\nthe denotation of the term. The expressions \u2018\\(4\\)\u2019 and\n\u2018\\(8/2\\)\u2019 have the same denotation but express\ndifferent senses, different ways of conceiving the same number. The\ndescriptions \u2018the morning star\u2019 and \u2018the evening\nstar\u2019 denote the same planet, namely Venus, but express\ndifferent ways of conceiving of Venus and so have different\nsenses. The name \u2018Pegasus\u2019 and the description \u2018the\nmost powerful Greek god\u2019 both have a sense (and their senses are\ndistinct), but neither has a denotation. However, even though the\nnames \u2018Mark Twain\u2019 and \u2018Samuel Clemens\u2019 denote\nthe same individual, they express different senses. (See May 2006b for\na nice discussion of the question of whether Frege believed that the\nsense of a name varies from person to person.) Using the distinction\nbetween sense and denotation, Frege can account for the difference in\ncognitive significance between identity statements of the form\n\u2018\\(a=a\\)\u2019 and those of the form\n\u2018\\(a=b\\)\u2019. Since the sense of \u2018\\(a\\)\u2019 differs\nfrom the sense of \u2018\\(b\\)\u2019, the components of the sense of\n\u2018\\(a=a\\)\u2019 and the sense of \u2018\\(a=b\\)\u2019 are\ndifferent.  Frege can claim that the sense of the whole expression is\ndifferent in the two cases. Since the sense of an expression accounts\nfor its cognitive significance, Frege has an explanation of the\ndifference in cognitive significance between \u2018\\(a=a\\)\u2019 and\n\u2018\\(a=b\\)\u2019, and thus a solution to the first puzzle.\n\n\nMoreover, Frege proposed that when a term (name or description)\nfollows a propositional attitude verb, it no longer denotes what it\nordinarily denotes. Instead, Frege claims that in such contexts, a\nterm denotes its ordinary sense. This explains why the Principle of\nIdentity Substitution fails for terms following the propositional\nattitude verbs in propositional attitude reports. The Principle\nasserts that truth is preserved when we substitute one name for\nanother having the same denotation. But, according to Frege\u2019s\ntheory, the names \u2018Mark Twain\u2019 and \u2018Samuel\nClemens\u2019 denote different senses when they occur in the\nfollowing sentences:\n\nJohn believes that Mark Twain wrote Huckleberry Finn.\n\n John believes that Samuel Clemens wrote Huckleberry Finn.\n\n\n\nIf they don\u2019t denote the same object, then there is no reason to\nthink that substitution of one name for another would preserve\ntruth.\n\n\nFrege developed the theory of sense and denotation into a\nthoroughgoing philosophy of language. This philosophy can be\nexplained, at least in outline, by considering a simple sentence such\nas \u2018John loves Mary\u2019. In Frege\u2019s view, the words\n\u2018John\u2019 and \u2018Mary\u2019 in this sentence are names,\nthe expression \u2018loves\u2019 signifies a function, and,\nmoreover, the sentence as a whole is a complex name. Each of these\nexpressions has both a sense and a denotation. The sense and\ndenotation of the names are basic; but sense and denotation of the\nsentence as a whole can be described in terms of the sense and\ndenotation of the names and the way in which those words are arranged\nin the sentence alongside the expression \u2018loves\u2019 (though\nsee Heck & May 2011 for discussion on whether the sense of a\npredicate maps the sense of a name to a thought). Let us refer to the\ndenotation and sense of the words as follows:\n\n \\(d[j]\\) refers to the denotation of the name \u2018John\u2019.\n\n \\(d[m]\\) refers to the denotation of the name\n\u2018Mary\u2019.\n\n \\(d[L]\\) refers to the denotation of the expression\n\u2018loves\u2019.\n\n \\(s[j]\\) refers to the sense of the name\n\u2018John\u2019.\n\n \\(s[m]\\) refers to the sense of the name\n\u2018Mary\u2019.\n\n \\(s[L]\\) refers to the sense of the expression\n\u2018loves\u2019.\n\n\nWe now work toward a theoretical description of the denotation of the\nsentence as a whole. On Frege\u2019s view, \\(d[j]\\) and\n\\(d[m]\\) are the real individuals John and Mary,\nrespectively. \\(d[L]\\) is a function that maps\n\\(d[m]\\) (i.e., Mary) to the function (\u00a0)\nloves Mary. This latter function serves as the denotation of\nthe predicate \u2018loves Mary\u2019 and we can use the notation\n\\(d[Lm]\\) to refer to it semantically. Now the function \\(d[Lm]\\) maps\n\\(d[j]\\) (i.e., John) to the denotation of the sentence \u2018John\nloves Mary\u2019.  Let us refer to the denotation of the sentence as\n\\(d[jLm]\\). Frege identifies the denotation of a sentence as one of\nthe two truth values.  Because \\(d[Lm]\\) maps objects to truth values,\nit is a concept. Thus, \\(d[jLm]\\) is the truth value The True if John\nfalls under the concept \\(d[Lm]\\); otherwise it is the truth value The\nFalse. So, on Frege\u2019s view, the sentence \u2018John loves\nMary\u2019 names a truth \nvalue.[6]\n\n\nThe sentence \u2018John loves Mary\u2019 also expresses a sense.\nIts sense may be described as follows. Although Frege doesn\u2019t\nappear to have explicitly said so, his work suggests that \\(s[L]\\)\n(the sense of the expression \u2018loves\u2019) is a function. This\nfunction would map \\(s[m]\\) (the sense of the name \u2018Mary\u2019)\nto the sense of the predicate \u2018loves Mary\u2019. Let us refer\nto the sense of \u2018loves Mary\u2019 as \\(s[Lm]\\). Now again,\nFrege\u2019s work seems to imply that we should regard \\(s[Lm]\\) as a\nfunction which maps \\(s[j]\\) (the sense of the name\n\u2018John\u2019) to the sense of the whole sentence. Let us call\nthe sense of the entire sentence\n \\(s[jLm]\\).[7]\n Frege calls the sense of a sentence a\nthought, and whereas there are only two truth values, he\nsupposes that there are an infinite number of thoughts.\n\n\nWith this description of language, Frege can give a general account of\nthe difference in the cognitive significance between identity\nstatements of the form \u2018\\(a=a\\)\u2019 and\n\u2018\\(a=b\\)\u2019. The cognitive significance is not accounted for\nat the level of denotation. On Frege\u2019s view, the sentences\n\u2018\\(4=8/2\\)\u2019 and \u2018\\(4=4\\)\u2019 both denote\nthe same truth value. The function \\((\\:)=(\\:)\\) maps \\(4\\) and\n\\(8/2\\) to The True, i.e., maps \\(4\\) and \\(4\\) to The\nTrue. So \\(d[4=8/2]\\) is identical to \\(d[4=4]\\); they are\nboth The True. However, the two sentences in question express\ndifferent thoughts. That is because \\(s[4]\\) is different from\n\\(s[8/2]\\). So the thought \\(s[4=8/2]\\) is distinct\nfrom the thought \\(s[4=4]\\). Similarly, \u2018Mark Twain = Mark\nTwain\u2019 and \u2018Mark Twain = Samuel Clemens\u2019 denote the\nsame truth value. However, given that \\(s\\)[Mark Twain] is distinct\nfrom \\(s\\)[Samuel Clemens], Frege would claim that the thought\n\\(s\\)[Mark Twain = Mark Twain] is distinct from the thought\n\\(s\\)[Mark Twain = Samuel Clemens].\n\n\nFurthermore, recall that Frege proposed that terms following\npropositional attitude verbs denote not their ordinary denotations but\nrather the senses they ordinarily express. In fact, in the following\npropositional attitude report, not only do the words \u2018Mark\nTwain\u2019, \u2018wrote\u2019 and \u2018Huckleberry Finn\n\u2019 denote their ordinary senses, but the entire sentence\n\u2018Mark Twain wrote Huckleberry Finn\u2019 also denotes\nits ordinary sense (namely, a thought):\n\nJohn believes that Mark Twain wrote Huckleberry Finn.\n\n\n\nFrege, therefore, would analyze this attitude report as follows:\n\u2018believes that\u2019 denotes a function that maps the denotation\nof the sentence \u2018Mark Twain wrote Huckleberry\nFinn\u2019 to a concept. In this case, however, the denotation of\nthe sentence \u2018Mark Twain wrote Huckleberry Finn\u2019\nis not a truth value but rather a thought. The thought it denotes is\ndifferent from the thought denoted by \u2018Samuel Clemens wrote\nHuckleberry Finn\u2019 in the following propositional\nattitude report:\n\nJohn believes that Samuel Clemens wrote Huckleberry Finn.\n\n\n\nSince the thought denoted by \u2018Samuel Clemens wrote\nHuckleberry Finn\u2019 in this context differs from the\nthought denoted by \u2018Mark Twain wrote Huckleberry\nFinn\u2019 in the same context, the concept denoted by\n\u2018believes that Mark Twain wrote Huckleberry Finn\u2019\nis a different concept from the one denoted by \u2018believes that\nSamuel Clemens wrote Huckleberry Finn\u2019. One may\nconsistently suppose that the concept denoted by the former predicate\nmaps John to The True whereas the concept denoted by the latter\npredicate does not. Frege\u2019s analysis therefore preserves our\nintuition that John can believe that Mark Twain wrote Huckleberry\nFinn without believing that Samuel Clemens did. It also preserves\nthe Principle of Identity Substitution\u2014the fact that one cannot\nsubstitute \u2018Samuel Clemens\u2019 for \u2018Mark Twain\u2019\nwhen these names occur after propositional attitude verbs does not\nconstitute evidence against the Principle. For if Frege is right,\nnames do not have their usual denotation when they occur in these\ncontexts.\n3.3 Frege\u2019s Philosophy of Language in Context\n\nIn an important paper, Bobzien (2021) develops an inductively strong\nargument to the conclusion that Frege adopted ideas by the Stoics, as\nthe latter were described in Carl Prantl\u2019s four volume History\nof Western Logic (Geschichte der Logik im Abendland,\n1855\u20131870) and in Diogenes Laertius\u2019 Lives of the\nPhilosophers (Vitae Philosophorum, 2nd century CE). The\nStoic ideas described in these two works originate with Zeno of\nCitium, Cleanthes, Chrysippus of Soli, Diogenes of Babylon, etc., and\nso both works are \u2018secondary\u2019 literature.  The relevant\nreports in Diogenes\u2019 Lives (which are largely quoted in\nPrantl) are among the closest we have to the source material for Stoic\nwritings on language and logic, while Section VI of Volume 1 of\nPrantl\u2019s Geschichte is a 95-page summary of Stoic\nviews.  Bobzien notes how widely read Prantl's work was, and how\nFrege's training left him well-qualified to understand the many quoted\npassages in Greek and Latin in his work. She then compiles evidence to\nthe conclusion that Frege borrowed heavily (and without attribution)\nfrom these works. This evidence is cumulative, for there is no smoking\ngun.  We can't point to any dog-eared copies with marginalia in\nFrege\u2019s own hand, or any copies of works by Prantl and Diogenes\nthat can be traced to Frege\u2019s library, or any records of Frege\nchecking out the works by Prantl and Diogenes from the Jena University\nlibrary.[8]\n\nBut in the 50-page Section III of her paper, Bobzien constructs\nnumerous tables of comparison that place passages from the Stoic and\nFregean corpora side-by-side and interlaces them with observations and\ncareful scholarship that connect the most salient (transliterated)\nGreek phrases with their German counterparts.  The overall effect is a\nkind of res ipsa loquitur \u2013 the thing speaks for itself\n\u2013 and places the ball squarely in the court of those who would\nattempt to deny the identities and similarities.  The evidence doesn't\nchallenge the insight and ingenuity that Frege brought to bear when\nhe formalized the language and logic of mathematics (and\ncertain constructions of natural language) in terms of the 19th\ncentury understanding of functions, and so the formal representations\npresented earlier in this entry were something that was not\nborrowed from the Stoics. And though Frege independently motivated the\nideas he absorbed from the Stoics, Bobzien shows how many aspects of\nFrege\u2019s underlying approach to language is directly founded on\nideas from fifteen hundred years ago and so are not as new as\noriginally thought. \n\nIt remains to get a sense of the range of the elements in common, some\nof which were pointed out by others in previous\n research.[9]\nAt the most general level, Bobzien compares the ways that the Stoics\nand Frege relate semantic \u2018content\u2019 (Greek lekta\nv.  Fregean Sinn) to the linguistic expression of that\ncontent.  Both distinguish the \u2018incomplete\u2019\n(ellip\u0113 v. unges\u00e4ttigt) content of\npredicates from the complete content of sentences, and there are\nparallels in what the Stoics and Frege have to say about complete\n\u2018assertible\u2019 contents (axi\u014dmata\nv. Gedanken), especially in connection with the fact that\nthese contents are the primary bearers of truth and falsity. Bobzien\nthen compares the two philosophies with regard to other kinds of\ncomplete contents, such as those expressed by commands, sentence\nquestions, expressions of emotion, word questions, and indexicals. In\neach case, Frege\u2019s descriptions of the content presented by\nthese linguistic expressions closely follow those of the Stoics.\nAnother group of similarities arises in her comparison of the\ndoctrines regarding complex contents produced with propositional\nconnectives, such as those expressed by sentences with negations\n(including contradictories, double negations, etc.), conjunctions,\ndisjunctions, conditionals, and sentences with \u2018because\u2019.\nA comparison of the two approaches to quantification and universality\nconcludes the paper.\n\nBy producing so many passages in parallel between the Stoic and\nFregean corpora, the details and evidence accumulate, thereby becoming\nincreasingly persuasive. Any student of Frege who wants to understand\nthe full range of his views on language will have to come to grips\nwith how those views are related to Stoic philosophy. Though Bobzien duly\nnotes the others who had previously remarked on some of the\nsimilarities (see again \n footnote 9), her paper of\n2021 is a good place to start, since the evidence assembled there is\nso comprehensive.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"PriSou\">A.
