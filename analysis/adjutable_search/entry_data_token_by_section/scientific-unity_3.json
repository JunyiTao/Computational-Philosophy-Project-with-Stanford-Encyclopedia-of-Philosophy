    "main_text": "Historical development in philosophy and science from Greek philosophy to Logical Empiricism in America || Positivism and logical empiricism\n1.4 Positivism and logical empiricism\n\nThe German tradition stood in opposition to the prevailing empiricist\nviews that, since the time of Hume, Comte and Mill, held that the\nmoral or social sciences (even philosophy) relied on conceptual and\nmethodological analogies with geometry and the natural sciences, not\njust astronomy and mechanics, as well as with biology. In the Baconian\ntradition, Comte emphasized a pyramidal hierarchy of disciplines in\nhis \u201cencyclopedic law\u201d or order, from the most general\nsciences about the simplest phenomena to the most specific sciences\nabout the most complex phenomena, each depending on knowledge from its\nmore general antecedent: from inorganic physical sciences (arithmetic,\ngeometry, mechanics, astronomy, physics and chemistry) to the organic\nphysical ones, such as biology and the new \u201csocial\nphysics\u201d, soon to be renamed sociology (Comte 1830\u20131842).\nMill, instead, pointed to the diversity of methodologies for\ngenerating, organizing and justifying associated knowledge with\ndifferent sciences, natural and human, and the challenges to impose a\nsingle standard (Mill 1843, Book VI). He came to view political\neconomy eventually as an art, a tool for reform more than a system of\nknowledge (Snyder 2006).\n\nDifferent yet connected currents of nineteenth-century positivism,\nfirst in European philosophy in the first half of the\ncentury\u2014Auguste Comte, J.S. Mill and Herbert Spencer\u2014and\nsubsequently in North American philosophy\u2014John Fiske, Chauncey\nWright and William James\u2014arose out of intellectual tensions\nbetween metaphysics and the sciences and identified positivism as\nsynthetic and scientific philosophy; accordingly, they were concerned\nwith the ordering and unification of knowledge through the\norganization of the sciences. The synthesis was either of methods\nalone\u2014Mill and Wright\u2014or else also of\ndoctrines\u2014Comte, Spencer and Fiske. Some used the term\n\u201csystem\u201d especially in relation to a common logic or\nmethod (Pearce 2015).\n\nIn the twentieth century the unity of science became a distinctive\ntheme of the scientific philosophy of logical empiricism (Cat 2021).\nThe question of unity engaged science and philosophy alike. In their\nmanifesto, logical empiricists\u2014known controversially also as\nlogical positivists\u2014and most notably the founding members of the\nVienna Circle, adopted the Machian banner of \u201cunity of science\nwithout metaphysics\u201d. This was a normative criterion of unity\nwith a role in social reform based on the demarcation between science\nand metaphysics: a unity of method and language that included all the\nsciences, natural and social. A common method did not necessarily\nimply a more substantive unity of content involving theories and their\nconcepts.\n\nA stronger reductive model within the Vienna Circle was recommended by\nRudolf Carnap in his The Logical Construction of the World\n(1928). While embracing the Kantian connotation of the term\n\u201cconstitutive system\u201d, it was inspired by recent formal\nstandards: Hilbert\u2019s axiomatic approach to formulating theories\nin the exact sciences and Frege\u2019s and Russell\u2019s logical\nconstructions in mathematics. It was also predicated on the formal\nvalues of simplicity, rationality, (philosophical) neutrality and\nobjectivity associated with scientific knowledge. In particular,\nCarnap tried to explicate such notions in terms of a rational\nreconstruction of science in terms of a method and a structure based\non logical constructions out of (1) basic concepts in axiomatic\nstructures and (2) rigorous, reductive logical connections between\nconcepts at different levels.\n\nDifferent constitutive systems or logical constructions would serve\ndifferent (normative) purposes: a theory of science and a theory of\nknowledge. Both foundations raised the issue of the nature and\nuniversality of a physicalist language.\n\nOne such system of unified science is the theory of science, in which\nthe construction connects concepts and laws of the different sciences\nat different levels, with physics and its genuine laws as fundamental,\nlying at the base of the hierarchy. Because of the emphasis on the\nformal and structural properties of our representations, objectivity,\nrationality and unity go hand in hand. Carnap\u2019s formal emphasis\ndeveloped further in Logical Syntax of Language (1934).\nAlternatively, all scientific concepts could be constituted or\nconstructed in a different system in the protocol language out of\nclasses of elementary complexes of experiences, scientifically\nunderstood, representing experiential concepts. Carnap subsequently\ndefended the epistemological and methodological universality of\nphysicalist language and physicalist statements. The unity of science\nin this context was an epistemological project (for a survey of the\nepistemological debates, see Uebel 2007; on different strands of the\nanti-metaphysical normative project of unity see Frost-Arnold\n2005).\n\nWhereas Carnap aimed at rational reconstructions, another member of\nthe Vienna Circle, Otto Neurath, favored a more naturalistic and\npragmatic approach, with a less idealized and reductive model of\nunity. His evolving standards of unity were generally motivated by the\ncomplexity of empirical reality and the application of empirical\nknowledge to practical goals. He spoke of an\n\u201cencyclopedia-model\u201d, opposed to the classic ideal of a\npyramidal, reductive \u201csystem-model\u201d. The\nencyclopedia-model took into account the presence within science of\nineliminable and imprecise terms from ordinary language and the social\nsciences and emphasized a unity of language and the local exchanges of\nscientific tools. Specifically, Neurath stressed the material-thing\nlanguage called \u201cphysicalism\u201d, not to be confounded with\nthe emphasis on the vocabulary of physics. Its motivation was partly\nepistemological, and Neurath endorsed anti-foundationalism; no unified\nscience, like a boat at sea, would rest on firm foundations. The\nscientific spirit abhorred dogmatism. This weaker model of unity\nemphasized empiricism and the normative unity of the natural and the\nhuman sciences.\n\nLike Carnap\u2019s unified reconstructions, Neurath\u2019s had\npragmatic motivations. Unity without reductionism provided a tool for\ncooperation and it was motivated by the need for successful\ntreatment\u2014prediction and control\u2014of complex phenomena in\nthe real world that involved properties studied by different theories\nor sciences (from real forest fires to social policy): unity of\nscience at the point of action. It is an argument from holism, the\ncounterpart of Duhem\u2019s claim that only clusters of hypotheses\nare confronted with experience. Neurath spoke of a \u201cboat\u201d,\na \u201cmosaic\u201d, an \u201corchestration\u201d, and a\n\u201cuniversal jargon\u201d. Following institutions such as the\nInternational Committee on Monism and the International Council of\nScientific Unions, Neurath spearheaded a movement for Unity of Science\nin 1934 that encouraged international cooperation among scientists and\nlaunched the project of an International Encyclopedia of Unity of\nScience. It expressed the internationalism of his socialist\nconvictions and the international crisis that would lead to the Second\nWorld War (Kamminga and Somsen 2016).\n\nAt the end of the Eighth International Congress of Philosophy, held in\nPrague in September of 1934, Neurath proposed a series of\nInternational Congresses for the Unity of Science. These took place in\nParis, 1935; Copenhagen, 1936; Paris, 1937; Cambridge, England, 1938;\nCambridge, Massachusetts, 1939; and Chicago, 1941. For the\norganization of the congresses and related activities, Neurath founded\nthe Unity of Science Institute in 1936 (renamed in 1937 as the\nInternational Institute for the Unity of Science) alongside the\nInternational Foundation for Visual Education, founded in 1933. The\nInstitute\u2019s executive committee was composed of Neurath, Philip\nFrank and Charles Morris.\n\nAfter the Second World War, a discussion of unity engaged philosophers\nand scientists in the Inter-Scientific Discussion Group, first as the\nScience of Science Discussion Group, in Cambridge, Massachusetts,\nfounded in October 1940 primarily by Philip Frank and Carnap\n(themselves founders of the Vienna Circle), Quine, Feigl, Bridgman,\nand the psychologists E. Boring and S.S. Stevens. This would later\nbecome the Unity of Science Institute. The group was joined by\nscientists from different disciplines, from quantum mechanics (Kemble\nand Van Vleck) and cybernetics (Wiener) to economics (Morgenstern), as\npart of what was both a self-conscious extension of the Vienna Circle\nand a reflection of local concerns within a technological culture\nincreasingly dominated by the interest in computers and nuclear power.\nThe characteristic feature of the new view of unity was the ideas of\nconsensus and, subsequently, especially within the USI,\ncross-fertilization. These ideas were instantiated in the emphasis on\nscientific operations (operationalism) and the creation of war-boosted\ncross-disciplines such as cybernetics, computation, electro-acoustics,\npsycho-acoustics, neutronics, game theory and biophysics (Galison\n1998; Hardcastle 2003).\n\nIn the late 1960s, Michael Polanyi and Marjorie Grene organized a\nseries of conferences funded by the Ford Foundation on unity of\nscience themes (Grene 1969a, 1969b, 1971). Their general character was\ninterdisciplinary and anti-reductionist. The group was originally\ncalled \u201cStudy Group on Foundations of Cultural Unity\u201d, but\nthis was later changed to \u201cStudy Group on the Unity of\nKnowledge\u201d. By then, a number of American and international\ninstitutions were already promoting interdisciplinary projects in\nacademic areas (Klein 1990). For both Neurath and Polanyi, the\norganization of knowledge and science, the Republic of Science, was\ninseparable from ideals of political organization.\n\nOver the last four decades much historical and philosophical\nscholarship has challenged the ideals of monism and reductionism and\npursued a growing critical interest in pluralism and interdisciplinary\ncollaboration (see below). Along the way, the distinction between the\nhistorical human sciences and ahistorical natural sciences has\nreceived much critical and productive attention. One outcome has been\nthe application and development of concepts and accounts in philosophy\nof history in understanding different human and natural sciences as\nhistorical, with a special focus on the epistemic role of unifying\nnarratives and standards and problems in disciplines such as\narcheology, geology, cosmology and paleontology (see, for instance,\nMorgan and Wise 2017; Currie 2019). Another outcome has been a renewed\ncritique of the autonomy of the social sciences. One concern is, for\ninstance, the raising social and economic value of the natural\nsciences and their influence on the models and methods of the social\nsciences; another is the influence on both of certain particular\npolitical and economic views. Other related concerns are the role of\nthe social sciences in political life and the assumption that humans\nare unique and superior to animals and emerging technologies (see, for\ninstance, van Bouwel 2009b; Kincaid and van Bouwel 2023).\n",
