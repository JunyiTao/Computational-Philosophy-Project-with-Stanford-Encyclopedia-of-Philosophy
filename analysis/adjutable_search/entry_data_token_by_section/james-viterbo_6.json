    "main_text": "Metaphysics || Relations\n3.3 Relations\n\nJames devotes five of his Quaestiones de divinis\npraedicamentis (qq. 11\u201315), representing some 270 pages of\nedited text, to the question of relations. It is with a view to\nproviding a proper account of divine relations, he explains, that it\nis \u201cnecessary to examine the nature of relation with such\ndiligence\u201d (Quaestiones de divinis praedicamentis, q.\n11, p. 12, 300\u2013301). But before turning to Trinitarian\nrelations, James devotes the whole of q.11 to the status of relations\nin general. The following account focuses exclusively on q. 11. James\nin essence adopts Henry of Ghent\u2019s \u201cmodalist\u201d\nsolution, which was to exercise considerable influence among late\nthirteenth-century thinkers (Henninger 1989), although he disagrees\nwith Henry about the proper way of understanding what a mode is.\n\nThe question boils down to whether relations exist in some manner in\nextra-mental reality or solely through the operation of the intellect,\nlike second intentions (species and genera). Many arguments can be\nadduced in support of each position, as Simplicius had already shown\nin his commentary on Aristotle\u2019s Categories\u2014a\nwork that would have a decisive influence on James\u2019 thought. For\ninstance, in support of the view that relations are not real, one may\npoint out that the intellect is able to apprehend relations between\nexistents and non-existents, e.g., the relation between a father and\nhis deceased son; yet, there cannot be anything real in the relation\ngiven that one of the two relata is a non-existent. But if so, then\nthe same must be true of all relations, as the intellectual operation\ninvolved is the same in all cases. Another argument concerns the way\nin which relations come to be and cease to be. This appears to happen\nwithout any change taking place in the subject which the relation is\nsaid to affect. For instance, a child who has lost his mother is said\nto be an orphan until the age of eighteen, at which point it ceases to\nbe one, although no change has occurred: \u201cthe relation recedes\nor ceases by reason of the mere passage of time.\u201d\n\nBut good reasons can also be found in support of the opposing view.\nFor one, Aristotle clearly considers relations to be real, as they\nconstitute one of the ten categories that apply to things outside the\nsoul. Furthermore, according to a view commonly held by the\nscholastics, the perfection of the universe cannot consist solely of\nthe perfection of the individual things of which it is made; it is\nalso determined by the relations those things have to each other;\nhence, those relations must be real.\n\nThe correct solution to the question of whether relations are real or\nnot, James contends, depends on assigning to a given relation no more\nbut no less reality than is fitting to it. Those who rely on arguments\nsuch as the first two above to infer that relations are entirely\ndevoid of reality are guilty of assigning relations too little\nreality; those who appeal to arguments such as the last two, showing\nthat relations are distinct from their subjects in the way in which\nthings are distinct from each other, assign too great a degree of\nreality to relations. The correct view must lie somewhere in between:\nrelations are real, but are not distinct from their subjects in the\nway one thing is distinct from another.\n\nThat they must be real is sufficiently shown by the first Simplician\narguments mentioned above, to which James adds some others of his own.\nHowever, showing that they are not things is slightly more\ncomplicated. James\u2019 position, in fact, is that relations are not\nthings \u201cproperly and absolutely speaking,\u201d but only\n\u201cin a certain way according to a less proper way of\nspeaking.\u201d A relation is not a thing in an absolute sense\nbecause of the \u201cmeekness\u201d of its being, for which reason\n\u201cit is like a middle point between being and non-being\u201d\n(Quaestiones de divinis praedicamentis, q. 11, p. 30,\n668\u20139). The reasoning behind this last statement is as follows:\nthe more intrinsic some principle is to a thing, the more that thing\nis said to be through it; what is maximally intrinsic to a thing is\nits substance; a thing is therefore maximally said to be on account of\nits substance. Now a thing\u2019s being related to another is, in the\nconstellation of accidents that qualify that thing, what is minimally\nintrinsic to it and thus farthest from its being, and so closest to\nnon-being. But if relations are not things, at least in the absolute\nsense, what are they? James answers that they are modes of\nbeing of their foundations. \u201cThe mode of being of a thing does\nnot differ from the thing in such a way as to constitute another\nessence or thing. The relation, therefore, is not different from its\nfoundation\u201d (Quaestiones de divinis praedicamentis, q.\n11, p. 33, 745\u20137). Speaking of relations as modes allows us to\nacknowledge their reality, as attested by experience, without\nhypostasizing them. A certain number\u2019s being equal to another is\nclearly something distinct from the number itself. The number and its\nbeing equal are two \u201csomethings\u201d (aliqua), says\nJames; they are not, however, two things; they are two in the\nsense that one is a thing (the number) and the other is a mode of\nbeing of the number.\n\nIn making relations modes of being of the foundation, James\nwas clearly taking his cue from Henry of Ghent, \u201cthe chief\nrepresentative of the modalist theory of relation\u201d (Henninger\n1989). For Henry and James, relations are real in the sense that they\nare distinct from their foundations and belong to extra mental\nreality. However, James\u2019 understanding of the way in which a\nrelation is a mode differs from Henry\u2019s. For Henry, a\nthing\u2019s mode is the same thing as its ratio or nature;\nit is the particular type of being that thing has, what\n\u201cspecifies\u201d it. But according to James\u2019\nunderstanding of the term, a mode lies beyond the\nratio of a thing, like an accident of that thing\n(Quaestiones de divinis praedicamentis, p. 34,\n767\u20138).\n\nIn conclusion, one could say that in his discussion of relations,\nJames was guided by the same motivation as many of his contemporaries,\nnamely securing the objectivity of relations without conferring\nfull-blooded existence upon them. Relations do exhibit some form of\nbeing, James believed, but it is a most faint one\n(debilissimum), the existence of a mode qua accident.\n",
