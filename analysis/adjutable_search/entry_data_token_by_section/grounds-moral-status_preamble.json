    "main_text": "\n\nAn entity has moral status if and only if it matters (to some degree)\nfrom the moral point of view for its own sake. More specifically,\none\u2019s moral status consists in there being certain moral reasons\nor requirements, for one\u2019s own sake, for how one is to be\ntreated. For instance, an animal may be said to have moral status if\nthere is at least some moral reason to avoid its suffering, on account\nof this animal itself and regardless of the consequences for other\nbeings.\n\nAt the most general level, there are two main ways of understanding\nthe moral requirements that moral status, or what others sometimes\ncall \u201cmoral standing\u201d or \u201cmoral\nconsiderability,\u201d entails. On the utilitarian approach (see the\nentry on the\n history of utilitarianism),\n moral considerability (their preferred term) is a matter of a moral\nrequirement to have one\u2019s welfare-related interests (e.g., the\nintensity, duration, etc. of one\u2019s pleasure or pain) factored\ninto the calculus that determines which action brings about the\ngreatest utility, and is thus morally best. On the non-utilitarian\napproach, to have moral status is for there to be reasons to act for\nthe sake of the entity (whether this might be to promote its\nwell-being or to appropriately regard some other aspect of the entity,\nsuch as its autonomy), reasons which are prior to, and may clash with,\nwhat the calculation of the overall best consequences would dictate.\nThe non-utilitarian approach is necessarily coupled with two further\nideas: acting unjustifiably against such reasons as well as failing to\ngive these reasons their proper weight in deliberation is not only\nwrong but wrongs the entity and one owes it to the entity to avoid\nacting in this way. Note that utilitarians could incorporate these two\nideas by claiming that it is owed to entities with moral status to\nproperly incorporate their interests into the utilitarian calculus,\nand that one wrongs an entity when this is not done. But these two\nideas are inessential to the utilitarian approach.\n\nSome non-utilitarian philosophers allow for the possibility that moral\nstatus comes in degrees, and introduce the notion of a highest degree\nof status: full moral status (FMS). After reviewing which entities\nhave been thought to have moral status and what is involved in having\nFMS, as opposed to a lesser degree of moral status, this article will\nsurvey different views of the grounds of moral status, focusing\nespecially on FMS, as well as the justification for treating these as\ngrounds of moral status.\n",
