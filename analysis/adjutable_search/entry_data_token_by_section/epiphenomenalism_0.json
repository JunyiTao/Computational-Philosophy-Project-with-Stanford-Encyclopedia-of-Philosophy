    "main_text": "Traditional Arguments (A) Pro\n1. Traditional Arguments (A) Pro\n\nMany philosophers recognize a distinction between two kinds of mental\nevents. (A) The first goes by many names, e.g., phenomenal\nexperiences, occurrences of qualitative consciousness, the\nwhat-it-is-like of experience, qualia.\nPains, afterimages, and tastes can serve as examples. (B) Mental\nevents of the second kind are occurrent propositional attitudes, e.g.,\n(occurrent) beliefs and desires. Arguments about epiphenomenalism may\nconcern either type of mental event, and (as made clear in Campbell\n1970) it should not be assumed that an argument given for one type can\nbe rephrased without loss for the other. The two types can often be\nconnected, however, through beliefs that one has one\u2019s\nexperiences. Thus, if it is held that pains have no physical effects,\nthen one must say either (i) pains do not cause beliefs that one is in\npain, or (ii) beliefs that one is in pain are epiphenomenal. For, if\npains caused beliefs that one is in pain, and the latter had physical\neffects, then pains would, after all, have effects in the physical\nworld (albeit indirectly). But epiphenomenalism says mental events\nhave no effects in the physical world.[1]\n\nThe central motivation for epiphenomenalism lies in the premise that\nwhenever there is a sufficient cause of a physical event, there is a\nsufficient physical cause of that event. If a mental event is\nsomething other than a physical event, then for it to make any causal\ncontribution of its own in the physical world would require a\nviolation of physical law. Descartes\u2019 (1649) interactionist\nmodel proposed that nonphysical events could cause small changes in\nthe shape of the pineal gland. But such nonphysical effects, however\nslight, would mean that the physical account of motion is\nfalse \u2014 for that account says that there will be no\nsuch change of shape unless there is a physical force that causes\nit.\n\nOne may try to rescue mental efficacy by supposing that whenever there\nis a mental effect in the physical world there is also a\nphysical force that is a sufficient cause of the effect. This view,\nhowever, both offends Occamist principles and fails to satisfy the\nleading anti-epiphenomenalist intuition, namely, that the mental\nmakes a difference to the physical, i.e., that it leads to\nbehavior that would not have happened in absence of the mental. The\nview also leads to an epistemological problem: If there is always a\nsufficient physical cause for whatever a mental event is supposed to\nproduce, then one could never be in a position where one\nneeds to suppose there is anything non-physical at work, and\nthus there could never be any reason to introduce mental causes into\none\u2019s account of neural events or behavior.\n\nMany contemporary thinkers would respond to the central motivation for\nepiphenomenalism by denying its dualistic presupposition, i.e., by\nholding that mental events are identical with physical events, and may\ntherefore have physical effects. Questions that remain for such\nphysicalistic views will be explained in section 3. For now, it should\nbe noted that the argument stated in the previous two paragraphs is\nnot supposed to be an argument for dualism, but only for adopting\nepiphenomenalism, once dualism is accepted.\n\nFurther support for epiphenomenalism can be derived from the fact,\nnoted by Wilhelm Wundt (1912), that \u201ceach simple sensation is\njoined to a very complicated combination of peripheral and central\nnerve processes\u201d, together with the fact that the causes of\nbehavior are likewise complex neural events. This latter fact makes it\nnatural to look for complex events throughout the causal chain leading\nto behavior; and these can be found in the neural events that are\nrequired for the occurrence of simple sensations. The sensations\nthemselves could not contribute to behavior without first having\nneural effects that are more complex than themselves. Thus an\nanti-epiphenomenalist stance would require us to prefer the hypothesis\nthat simple sensations cause (relatively) complex neural events over\nthe hypothesis that complex neural events (that are required in any\ncase for the causation of sensations) are adequate to cause the neural\nevents required for the causation of behavior.\n",
