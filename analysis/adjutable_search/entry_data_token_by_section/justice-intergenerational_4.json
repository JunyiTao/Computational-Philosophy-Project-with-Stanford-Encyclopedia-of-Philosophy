No Rights Due to Contingency of Future People Upon Our Decisions?\n\nThe main source of skepticism concerning the very possibility of\nfuture people having welfare rights vis-\u00e0-vis those currently\nliving rests upon the contingency of future people upon currently\nliving people\u2019s decisions and actions. We know, of course, that\nwhen we harm future people\u2019s interests and violate their rights,\nspecific persons are harmed. But the decision we take counts as a\nnecessary condition of the very existence of this genetically and\nnumerically specific set of people at some future point in time. The\nso-called \u201cNon-Identity-Problem\u201d presupposes this fact and\ninterprets it as a challenge to the very possibility of\nintergenerational justice.\n",
