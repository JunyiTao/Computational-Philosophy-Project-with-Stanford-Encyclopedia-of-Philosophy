    "main_text": "Utilitarianism: Thought and Action\n4. Utilitarianism: Thought and Action\n\nIn traditional China, the Confucian literati did not consider thought\nand learning to be separate from action in the public world at large.\nThey were, in fact, much inspired by a beatific vision of a public\nspace in which social and political actions yielded a world of peace\nand order. In the classic text, Doctrine of the Mean\n(Zhongyong), the profound paradigmatic person\n(junzi) is described as one who reverently realizes\none\u2019s virtuous, heaven-conferred nature, and pursues inquiry and\nlearning. The Great Learning (Daxue) further tells\nus that these efforts have a three-pronged end: cultivating the self\n(xiuxin), ordering the state (zhiguo), and bringing\npeace to the world (ping tianxia). Thus, the individuated\ninternal goal of achieving sagehood (neisheng) is\ninextricably bound to the outer concerns of implementing the Way of\nkingship (waiwang). In contradistinction to Plato\u2019s or\neven Hegel\u2019s otherworldly philosophy\u2014Plato saw the\nphilosopher as one whose body (not mind) inhabited the city of his\nfellow human beings, and Hegel viewed philosophy as a world stood on\nits head, from the vantage point of commonsense\u2014Confucianism\nregarded the world of workaday affairs as coterminous with the world\nof ideas in which thinkers dwelled. The abiding ideal of\n\u201cordering the world and extending utility\u201d (jingshi\nzhiyong) demanded the conjugation of private moral cultivation\nand its public realization. In Qing philosophy, there was this\npalpable intellectual purport based on the utilitarian ideal of\nordering the world, which bred a moral seriousness about the everyday\nrealities of society and state. This utilitarianism posited an\nintimate relation between thought and action, regarding as\ninsignificant or irrelevant metaphysical concepts that resisted\ntranslation into some form of effort leading to concrete outcomes. The\ncorollaries of xue (learning) and zhi (knowing) were\nyong (utility) and xing (action).\n\nTo be sure, this utilitarianism was not devoid of moral and normative\nimperatives, to the extent that actions had to be inspired and guided\nby values such as moral rulership (wang), rightness and\nintegrity (yi), and public-mindedness (gong). At the\nsame time, it embraced an ethical perspective that invested value in\nthe utility and function of secular, institutional amelioration. From\nthe late Ming onward, thought did gravitate far more toward\nactualities and practicalities, as the ideal and slogan of\njingshi, ordering the world, took center stage. Gu Yanwu\nloathed what he considered to be the \u201cempty and vacuous\nlearning\u201d (kongxu zhi xue) in the Ming times, which\n\n\n\ndisposed of and refrained from talking about the ills and deprivations\nwithin the four seas, and spoke always about lofty imperceptible\nsubtlety and absolute holistic purity. (Gu GTLSWJ: 43) \n\n\nFollowing the examples of the sages who never severed the ties between\nlearning and socio-political concerns, Gu proclaimed that \n\n\nhe would not pursue any learning that does not relate to the central\nprinciple of the Six Classics and the affairs and responsibilities in\nthe current world. \n\n\nJust as \n\n\nall the books written by them [the sages] were for the purpose of\ndiscarding the wrong and returning to the right, and of changing\ncustoms and practices so as to attain order and harmony, (GTLSWJ: 142)\n\n\n\nso \u201ca profound person pursues learning to illuminate the Way and\nsave the world\u201d (GTLSWJ: 103). Gu wrote his masterwork,\nRecords of Daily Knowledge (Rizhi lu), to urge\nparticipation in society, a life-long endeavor that \u201cdid not end\nuntil death\u201d (si er hou yi). The book formulated\npractical views that would be useful for the rulers: \n\n\nI wrote\u2026the Records of Daily Knowledge, the first part\nof which is on classical studies, the middle part on the way of\ngovernance, and the final part on general experience and general\nknowledge, altogether over thirty fascicles. In the event a prince\nappears, he would discern in it actual practices and affairs. With it,\nhe could elevate this current age to the prosperity of the ancient age\nof order. (GTLSWJ: 103)\n\n\nA similar utilitarian thread ran through Huang Zongxi\u2019s thought.\nHe defined the existential mission of a Confucian profound person,\njunzi, to which everyone should aspire: \u201cTo bring peace\nto the country and to preserve society are the obligations of a\njunzi\u201d (Huang MYDFL: 32). His learning was meant to\nform \u201cthe warp and the woof of heaven-and-earth\u201d\n(jingwei tiandi), and so he criticized scholars for \n\n\ntrying futilely to manage the world by lavish and high-sounding ideas\nof establishing the ultimate in order to regenerate the masses, of\nestablishing the mind-heart of the universe, and of following the\neverlasting peace of the thousand ages. \n\n\nArrogantly, they \n\n\nview those who manage finances and taxation as engaging in hoarding\nprofit and wealth\u2026 and those who carefully supervise\nadministration and government as tawdry officials. \n\n\nBut \n\n\nwhen the day to serve the country comes, they are bemused and\nbefuddled, as though they are sitting within a cloud. Therefore, the\nways of the world (shidao) have become corrupt and rotten.\n(Huang NLWDHJ: vol. 6, p. 549) \n\n\nThe practical ways of the world could be found in the classics and\nhistories: \u201cThe Six Classics are all books that recorded the\nWay\u2026, the actual rulership (shizhi)\u2026, the\nactual practices (shixing)\u201d (Huang NLWDHJ: vol. 6, p.\n442\u2013443). \u201cAll that was recorded in the Twenty-one\nHistories was the enterprise of ordering the world\u201d (Huang NLWY:\nvol. 6, p. 351).\n\nWang Fuzhi also castigated the late Ming literati for embracing empty\nintuitionism, \u201cbecoming lax about maintaining clear distinctions\nin social relations (minglun) and investigating\nthings\u201d, such that they no longer cared about \u201cwhether or\nnot names correspond to realities\u201d (quoted in McMorran 1975:\n434). Learning, to Wang, must have a practical intellectual purport:\n\n\n\nEvery paragraph, every title, every work, and every sentence should\nlead one back to one\u2019s body and mind-heart. They should cohere\nwith one\u2019s grand purpose, \n\n\nwhich is \n\n\nto distinguish its grand meaning in order to establish the basis for\ncultivating oneself and governance. (quoted in Ji Wenfu 1978:\n1\u20133) \n\n\nWang privileged the study of history precisely because of its\npractical utility: \u201cWhat is valuable about history is its\naccount of the past as the teacher of the future\u201d. History would\nbe ill written if \u201cthe general framework of ordering the world\n(jingshi) is not illuminated\u201d (quoted in 1978: 1). In\nshort, historical learning, in the end, was statecraft.\n\nWhile it seemed evident that utilitarian thinking that actively\ncombatted moral intuitionism predominated in the early Qing in the\nseventeenth century, its edges might have been dulled in the\neighteenth century. The conventional explanation is that scholars\nchanneled their energy into the sort of pedantic studies of philology\nand classical texts, as represented by the so-called movement of\nevidential learning (kaozheng xue) that received the\ncourt\u2019s approval and encouragement. But it is a very partial\nview that fails to convey the whole picture, as utilitarian thinking\nwas in fact alive and well among the kaozheng practitioners\nand partisans, many of whom continued to see the classics as guides to\nordering the world. Qian Daxin (1728\u20131804), a towering figure in\nthe kaozheng movement, touted the practical value of these\nancient texts: \n\n\n[The Five Classics] were employed by the sages to make the warps and\nwoofs of the world. The ultimate goal was to render the world good.\nThe secondary function was to rule oneself. (Qian QYTWJ: 310) \n\n\nQian referred to the classics specifically in terms of the ideals of\njingshi and zhiyong\u2014ordering the world and\nextending utility: \n\n\nConfucian learning rests with the illumination of the substance in\norder to extend utility. The Odes, Documents, and\nRites are all writings for the ordering of the world. In the\nAnalects with twenty fascicles and Mencius with\nseven fascicles, more than half are discussions on administration and\ngovernment. What the masters and students discussed and sought at the\ntime were the principles of sustaining oneself, of living in the\nworld, of refusal, of acceptance, of receiving, and of giving. As for\n[the philosophical questions of] nature and the Way of heaven, even\nthose who were eminently upright did not hear of them. In this manner,\nthe Confucians worked on practicality and utility, and did not value\nempty talks. (QYTWJ: 373) \n\n\nIn short, wen, literary expressions and writings, must seek\nto realize the following practical goals: illuminating the Way\n(mingdao), ordering the world (jingshi), revealing\nthe subtle (chanyu), and rectifying customs\n(zhengsu).\n\nZhang Xuecheng\u2019s historiographic thinking was anchored on the\ngoal and ideal of ordering the world. Because the classics\n\u201coutlined the ordering of the world by the kings and the\nemperors\u201d, they were histories indeed. Zhang proclaimed that\n\u201chistorical learning is for the ordering of the world\u201d\n(shixue suoyi jingshi): \n\n\nI say, \u201chistorical learning is for the ordering of the world. It\nis surely not writings of empty words\u201d. For instance, the Six\nClassics all came from Confucius. The early Confucians thought that\nhis greatest achievement was the Spring and Autumn Annals. It\nwas precisely because it was intimately related to the social\nrealities of the time. Those of the later ages who spoke about\nwritings disregarded social realities, and discussed in an abstract\nmanner the nature and heaven. Thus, I know they achieved nothing.\nScholars who do not know such purport [of learning] are not qualified\nto talk about historical learning. \n\n\nZhang criticized the Han learning scholars for dwelling on the trivial\nceremonial details (quli) while neglecting and ignoring the\nbasic political institutions (jingli). Practical learning\nmeant understanding \u201cthe essential substance of the ancients in\norder to enlarge the mind-heart\u201d, so that one could\n\u201cdetermine what is right for the present\u201d (Zhang WSTY:\n53).\n\nThe discursive production of Qing philosophy was empowered and powered\nby the utilitarian impulse to engender and yield utility, seeking\nemancipation from the moral introspection of Song-Ming thought. As\nQing philosophical thought abjured abstract pondering of metaphysical\nmatters and questions, it turned to advocacy for ameliorative actions\nthat directly bettered the state and society.\n",
