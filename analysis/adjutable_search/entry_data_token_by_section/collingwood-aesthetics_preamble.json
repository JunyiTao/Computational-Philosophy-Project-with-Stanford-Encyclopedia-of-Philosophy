    "main_text": "\n\nR. G. Collingwood (1889\u20131943) was primarily a philosopher of\nhistory, a metaphysican and archaeologist, and considered his work in\naesthetics\u2014the principal work being his The Principles of\nArt (1938)\u2014as secondary (for more about his general\nphilosophy, see the entry on\n Robin George Collingwood).\n But the work in aesthetics has enjoyed a persistent readership that\ncontinues into the present. In the years after WWII he was probably\nthe most widely read and influential aesthetician to have written in\nEnglish since Addison, Hutcheson and Hume (not counting Ruskin as an\naesthetician), and to this day continues to make his way into\nanthologies as a principal proponent of the expressive theory of art.\nIn the field of the philosophy of history, Collingwood famously held\nthe doctrine of \u2018Re-enactment\u2019: since the subject is human\nbeings in action, the historian cannot achieve understanding by\ndescribing what happened from an external point of view, but must\nelicit in the reader\u2019s own mind the thoughts that were taking\nplace in the principal actors involved in historical events.\nSimilarly, the aesthetic procedure is one whereby the artist and\nspectator jointly come to realize, to come to know, certain mental\nstates (see Guyer 2018). Art is fundamentally expression. Collingwood\nsaw two main obstacles to general understanding and acceptance of\nthis: First, the word \u2018art\u2019 has surreptitiously acquired\nmultiple meanings among ordinary folk which should be disentangled;\nsecond, a philosophical theory of the phenomenon of expression is\nneeded to show that it is an essential part of the life of the mind,\nnot just a special activity that poets go in for. (Collingwood\nactually published an earlier theory of art in Outlines of a\nPhilosophy of Art, but came to regard that theory as mistaken,\nsuperseded by the one in Principles of Art; what follows, and\nall references, concern the latter only).\n",
