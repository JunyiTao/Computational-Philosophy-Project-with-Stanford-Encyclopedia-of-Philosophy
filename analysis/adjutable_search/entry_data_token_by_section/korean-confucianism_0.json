    "main_text": "Initial Observations\n1. Initial Observations\n\nThe tradition that is known as Confucianism in the West is known as\nYuhak in Korean (\u5112\u5b78; C. Ruxue) [the\nstudy of the \u201cRu\u201d scholars], or Yugyo\n\u5112\u654e, C. Rujiao) [the teachings of the scholars].\nKorean Confucians have contributed greatly to complex metaphysical\ndiscussions relating to the moral psychology of Confucian philosophy\nand its teachings. The goal of such teachings is to become a sage\n(\u8056\u4eba, C. Shengren, K. S\u014fngin), and\nthis is a salient feature of Korean Confucianism, referring to someone\nwho studies, and who morally transforms themselves through concerted\neffort. In this sense, one\u2019s moral cultivation, known in the\nConfucian texts as \u201cself-cultivation\u201d (\u4fee\u5df1,\nC. xiuji, K. sugi), meant that humans should depend\non themselves and their own inherent abilities to solve their own\nproblems (social and personal), ruling out the need for help from gods\nor deities. This becomes evident when we read the Korean philosophical\ntexts on sagehood discussed below.\n\nThe classical texts of Confucianism, which were later edited and\nprobably re-organised by Confucius himself, are known as the Five\nClassics (\u4e94\u7d93, C. Wujing, K.\nOgy\u014fng):\n\nYijing (\u6613\u7d93) [Classic of Changes],\nShujing (\u66f8\u7d93) [Classic of History],\nShijing (\u8a69\u7d93) [Classic of Poetry],\nLiji (\u79ae\u8a18) [Records of Rites], and\nChunqiu (\u6625\u79cb) [Spring and Autumn\nAnnals].\n\n\nLater, a new body of work would be grouped into a new set of texts\ncollectively known as The Four Books (\u56db\u66f8, C.\nSishu, K. Sas\u014f), by the great Southern Song dynasty\n(1126\u20131271) scholar Zhu Xi (1130\u20131200):\n\nLunyu (\u8ad6\u8a9e) [The Analects],\nDaxue (\u5927\u5b78) [The Great Learning],\nZhongyong (\u4e2d\u5eb8) [The Doctrine of the Mean],\nand\nMengzi (\u5b5f\u5b50) [The Mencius].\n(The Daxue and\nZhongyong were originally separate chapters in the\nLiji\u2014Record of Rites. See also\n Other Internet Resources\n for more information.)\n\n\nZhu, a harsh critique of Buddhism, synthesised the later metaphysical\ndevelopments of Confucianism, known as Neo-Confucianism, and his ideas\nshaped the trajectory of Korean Neo-Confucianism. Additionally, his\ncommentaries on the Four Books (and his re-organisation and\nre-wording in some cases) were considered \u201corthodox\u201d,\nwhile other interpretations were considered heterodox. Meanwhile,\nKorean Confucians clearly debated received ideas differently than\nConfucian scholars in China, and this gives the Korean contribution to\nConfucianism even greater significance.\n\nOne\u2019s social obligations calibrated through a distinct set of\nrelationships has been extremely important for Koreans, in the past as\nwell as in the present. The \u201cFive Cardinal Relationships\u201d\n(\u4e94\u502b, C. wulun, K. oryun) of\nConfucianism, where each relationship was related to a particular\nvirtue, are emphasised in Mencius:\n\n\nbetween father and son there should be affection; between ruler and\nminister there should be righteousness; between husband and wife there\nshould be attention to their separate functions; between old and young\nthere should be proper order; and between friends there should be\nfaithfulness. (3A:4; translated SB-Chan: 69\u201370)\n\n\nIn the Korean Confucian tradition, social position and age have\nimportant implications for maintaining social hierarchies, and women\nwere particularly disadvantaged through interpretations of these\nrelationships, expected always to be subordinate to men: fathers,\nhusbands and sons (see Cawley 2018). Adhering to these clearly\ndelineated relationships was associated with a well-functioning\n\u201charmonious\u201d society, whereby harmony was achieved through\nfulfilling one\u2019s specific role. Nevertheless, the\n\u201csuperior\u201d person in these relationships should\nbe a morally and socially responsible individual, especially the king,\nwho also has obligations to the population he governs, a theme that is\nrecurrent in the literature on \u201cSage Learning\u201d\n(\u8056\u5b78, C. shengxue, K. s\u014fnghak),\nthat shapes and defines Korean Neo-Confucianism. The other\nrelationship, emphasised much more in Korea than in China, is the idea\nof filial piety (\u5b5d, C. xiao, K. hyo).\nHyo remains one of the defining features of Korean\nConfucianism, where respect for one\u2019s parents and elders is\nstill emphasised. The eldest male is the most respected person in the\nfamily, which also highlights the gender bias that Confucianism has\nfacilitated on the peninsula, something that is contentious today in a\nKorea that is heavily debating this gender imbalance, gaining traction\nthanks to the #MeToo movement.\n\nRitual propriety (\u79ae, C. li, K. ye), or the\nuse of rituals a mechanism for ordering society, is something still\nprevalent in rituals related towards ancestors, known as\nchesa (\u796d\u7940, C. jisi) in Korea, which\nare still conducted by many Korean families. They, however, further\nreinforce other social norms related to patrilineality and the place\nof privilege for the eldest son, while preventing women from\nperforming these rituals. Naoaki Hiraishi (2003: 187) underscores the\nimportant function of rituals in society, noting their refining\ninfluence, and how they have\n\n\nthe advantage of inculcating people with social norms rather than\n[\u2026] social ordering with criminal law and other physical\npunishment.\n\n\nThe refining nature of moral education is another important feature of\nKorean Confucianism, something scholars asserted and accentuated, and\neven the king was indoctrinated with formal Confucian training with\nlectures on conformist Confucian morality (see Sohn 2000: ch. 1).\nKorean Confucians agreed with the Mencian tradition of education,\nshaped by the view of \u201chuman nature\u201d (\u6027, C.\nxing, K. s\u014fng) as something inherently good,\nwhereby education was a vehicle to refine and promote one\u2019s\nvirtuous nature. In relation to Korean Confucianism, it is not an\nunderstatement to say that Mencius\u2019 ideas became responsible for\na great deal of Chos\u014fn\u2019s metaphysical stimulation and\nrecalibration, while also ultimately leading to its philosophical\ndebates.\n",
