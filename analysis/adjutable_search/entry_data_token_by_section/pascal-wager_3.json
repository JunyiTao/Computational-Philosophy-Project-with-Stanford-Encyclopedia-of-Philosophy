The Argument From Generalized Expectations: \u201cPascal\u2019s Wager\u201d\n\nWe continue the quotation.\n\nBut there is an eternity of life and happiness. And this being so, if\nthere were an infinity of chances, of which one only would be for you,\nyou would still be right in wagering one to win two, and you would act\nstupidly, being obliged to play, by refusing to stake one life against\nthree at a game in which out of an infinity of chances there is one\nfor you, if there were an infinity of an infinitely happy life to\ngain. But there is here an infinity of an infinitely happy life to\ngain, a chance of gain against a finite number of chances of loss, and\nwhat you stake is finite. It is all divided; wherever the infinite is\nand there is not an infinity of chances of loss against that of gain,\nthere is no time to hesitate, you must give all\u2026\n\n\nAgain this passage is difficult to understand completely.\nPascal\u2019s talk of winning two, or three, lives is a little\nmisleading. By his own decision theoretic lights, you would\nnot act stupidly \u201cby refusing to stake one life against\nthree at a game in which out of an infinity of chances there is one\nfor you\u201d\u2014in fact, you should not stake more than an\ninfinitesimal amount in that case (an amount that is bigger than 0,\nbut smaller than every positive real number). The point, rather, is\nthat the prospective prize is \u201can infinity of an infinitely\nhappy life\u201d. In short, if God exists, then wagering for God\nresults in infinite utility.\n\nWhat about the utilities for the other possible outcomes? There is\nsome dispute over the utility of \u201cmisery\u201d. Hacking\ninterprets this as \u201cdamnation\u201d (188), and Pascal does\nlater speak of \u201chell\u201d as the outcome in this case. Martin\n1983 among others assigns this a value of negative infinity.\nSobel 1996, on the other hand, is one author who takes this value to\nbe finite. There is some textual support for this reading: \u201cThe\njustice of God must be vast like His compassion. Now justice to the\noutcast is less vast \u2026 than mercy towards the elect\u201d. As\nfor the utilities of the outcomes associated with God\u2019s\nnon-existence, Pascal tells us that \u201cwhat you stake is\nfinite\u201d. This suggests that whatever these values are, they are\nfinite.\n\nPascal\u2019s guiding insight is that the argument from expectation\ngoes through equally well whatever your probability for\nGod\u2019s existence is, provided that it is non-zero and finite\n(non-infinitesimal)\u2014\u201ca chance of gain against a finite\nnumber of chances of\n loss\u201d.[4]\n\nPascal\u2019s assumptions about utilities and probabilities are now\nin place. In another landmark moment in this passage, he next presents\na formulation of expected utility theory. When gambling, \u201cevery\nplayer stakes a certainty to gain an uncertainty, and yet he stakes a\nfinite certainty to gain a finite uncertainty, without transgressing\nagainst reason\u201d. How much, then, should a player be prepared to\nstake without transgressing against reason? Here is Pascal\u2019s\nanswer: \u201c\u2026 the uncertainty of the gain is proportioned to\nthe certainty of the stake according to the proportion of the chances\nof gain and loss \u2026\u201d It takes some work to show that this\nyields expected utility theory\u2019s answer exactly, but it is work\nwell worth doing for its historical importance and is included in \na footnote.[5].)\n\nLet us now gather together all of these points into a single argument.\nWe can think of Pascal\u2019s Wager as having three premises: the\nfirst concerns the decision table\u00a0of rewards, the second concerns\nthe probability that you should give to God\u2019s existence, and the\nthird is a maxim about rational decision-making. Specifically:\n\n\n\nEither God exists or God does not exist, and you can either wager for\nGod or wager against God. The utilities of the relevant possible\noutcomes are as follows, where \\(f_1, f_2\\), and \\(f_3\\) are numbers\nwhose values are not specified beyond the requirement that they be\nfinite:\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nGod exists\nGod does not exist \n\nWager for God\n\\(\\infty\\)\n\\(f_1\\) \n\nWager against God\n\\(f_2\\)\n\\(f_3\\)  \n \nRationality requires the probability that you assign to God\nexisting to be positive (and finite).\nRationality requires you to perform the act of maximum expected\nutility (when there is one).\nConclusion 1. Rationality requires you to wager for\nGod.\nConclusion 2. You should wager for God.\n\n\nWe have a decision under risk, with probabilities assigned to the ways\nthe world could be, and utilities assigned to the outcomes. In\nparticular, we represent the infinite utility associated with\nsalvation as \u2018\\(\\infty\\)\u2019. We assume that the real line is\nextended to include the element \u2018\\(\\infty\\)\u2019, and that the\nbasic arithmetical operations are extended as follows:\n\nFor all real numbers \\(r\\): \\(\\infty + r = \\infty\\).\n\nFor all real numbers \\(r\\): \\(\\infty \\times r = \\infty\\) if \\(r \\gt\n0\\).\n\nThe first conclusion seems to follow from the usual calculations of\nexpected utility (where \\(p\\) is your positive (and finite)\nprobability for God\u2019s existence): \n\\[ \\mathrm{E}(\\text{wager for God}) = \\infty \\times p + f_1 \\times(1 - p) = \\infty \\]\n\n\nThat is, your expected utility of belief in God is infinite\u2014as\nPascal puts it, \u201cour proposition is of infinite force\u201d. On\nthe other hand, your expected utility of wagering against God is\n\n\\[ \\mathrm{E}(\\text{wager against God}) = f_2 \\times p + f_3 \\times(1 - p) \\]\n\n\nThis is\n finite.[6]\n By premise 3, rationality requires you to perform the act of maximum\nexpected utility. Therefore, rationality requires you to wager for\nGod.\n\nWe now survey some of the main objections to the argument.\n",
