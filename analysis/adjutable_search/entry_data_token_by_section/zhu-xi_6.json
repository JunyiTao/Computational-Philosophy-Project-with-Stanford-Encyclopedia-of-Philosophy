    "main_text": "Natural Philosophy || Philosophic Synthesis\n4.2 Philosophic Synthesis\n\nZhu Xi erected a philosophical synthesis that has been compared\nbroadly to the systems of Plato, Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, Whitehead,\nand others. These \u201cGreat Chain\u201d systems are hierarchical\nand rooted in the distinction between form and matter. Recent\nimmanental readings of Zhu Xi\u2019s thought have stirred comparisons\nwith Spinoza and even Husserl (Choi 1999; Yeo 2013). Zhu Xi preserved\nthe immanental character of his hierarchy by incorporating Zhou\nDunyi\u2019s conception of world (and self) as shown in the\nDiagram of the Supreme Polarity (Taiji tu), as a way\nto combine the Cheng brothers\u2019 concept of li (pattern)\nwith Zhang Zai\u2019s notion of qi (cosmic vapor) as\norganically integrated in a holistic system. In Zhou\u2019s treatise,\nExplanation of the Diagram of the Supreme Polarity (Taiji\ntu shuo) (Adler 2014), Zhu discerned a viable account of the\nformation of the world in stages from the original unformed\nqi, to yin and yang, the five phases,\nearth, wood, fire, water, and metal, and on to heaven, earth and the\nten thousand things. Zhu blended this conception with ideas from the\nBook of Change and its commentaries in setting forth a\ncomprehensive philosophy of cosmic and human creativity and providing\nphilosophical grounds for the received Confucian concepts of human\nnature and self-cultivation. \n\nZhu Xi\u2019s penchant for thinking in polarities, li and\nqi, in particular, has continued to stir critics to regard\nhim as a dualist who used two fundamental concepts to explain reality.\nFor his part, any viable account of the complexity of phenomena must\ninvolve two or more facets in order to register their complexity,\nvariety, and changes. Zhu generalized the organic understanding of\nli and qi implied in Zhou Dunyi\u2019s\nExplanation under a principle of complementarity, inspired by\nCheng Hao\u2019s observation that all things have their complement\n(discussed in the next section). At first, Zhu thought this principle\nonly governed qi phenomena as patterned by li, but\neventually he admitted that not only were yin and\nyang paradigmatic polar complements but that the supreme\npolarity (taiji) complemented the yin-yang polarity,\nand inferred that li and qi, as the references of\ntaiji and yin-yang, respectively, too had to be\ncomplements. This meant that li and qi were\nfunctionally on a par and mutually implicative. Zhu still felt the\nneed to prioritize li ontologically and ethically, however,\nfor the reason that li underwrites both the possibility of\nqi ordering (to yield a world and phenomena) and the\npossibility of moral feelings and norms (to yield ethics and a system\nof rites). Treating li and qi as full ontological\ncomplements would quite possibly entail a Daoist conception of nature\nas pure spontaneity and ethics as just perspectival while prioritizing\nqi over li would be inadequate for understanding the\nworld and phenomenal orders, and reduce ethics to the received\nnorms.\n",
