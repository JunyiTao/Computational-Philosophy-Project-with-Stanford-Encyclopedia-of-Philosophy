Common Sense and Certainty\n\n\nAn important aspect of Moore's rejection of idealism was his\naffirmation of a \u2018common sense\u2019 realist position, according\nto which our ordinary common-sense view of the world is largely\ncorrect. Moore first explicitly championed this position in his 1910-11\nlectures Some Main Problems of Philosophybut he made it his\nown when he responded in 1925 to an invitation to describe his\n\u2018philosophical position\u2019 by setting this out as \u2018A\nDefence of Common Sense\u2019. Moore begins the paper by listing a\nlarge number of \u2018truisms\u2019 such as that \u2018the earth had\nexisted also for many years before my body was born\u2019. Concerning\nthese truisms he then asserts, first, that he knows them for certain,\nsecond, that other people likewise know for certain the truth of\ncomparable truisms about themselves and, third, that he knows this\nsecond general truth (and, by implication, others do too). So the truth\nand general knowledge of these truisms is a matter of common sense.\nHaving set out these truisms, Moore then acknowledges that some\nphilosophers have denied their truth or, more commonly, denied our\nknowledge of them (even though, according to Moore, they also know\nthem) and he attempts to show that these denials are incoherent or\nunwarranted. These claims might seem to leave little space for radical\nphilosophical argument. But in the last part of the paper Moore argues\nthat his defence of common sense leaves completely undecided the\nquestion as to how the truistic propositions which make up the common\nsense view of the world are to be analysed; the analysis may be as\nradical as one likes as long as it is consistent with the truth and\nknowability of the propositions analysed. Thus, for example, he is\ncontent to allow that philosophical argument may show that a\nphenomenalist analysis of propositions about the physical world is\ncorrect.\n\n\nThis last point shows that Moore's defence of common sense is not as\nmuch of a constraint on philosophical theory as one might at first have\nthought; for philosophical analysis can reveal to us facts about the\n\u2018principal or ultimate subject\u2019 of a truistic proposition\nwhich are by no means what common sense supposes. This implication is\nimportant when one turns to consider Moore's most famous paper, his\n\u2018Proof of an External World\u2019 \u2014 the text of a British\nAcademy lecture delivered in 1939 just when Moore was retiring from his\nCambridge Professorship. Moore here sets himself the task of doing what\nKant had earlier set himself to do, namely providing a proof of the\nexistence of \u2018external objects\u2019. Much of the lecture is\ndevoted to working out what counts as an \u2018external object\u2019,\nand Moore claims that these are things whose existence is not dependent\nupon our experience. So, he argues, if he can prove the existence of\nany such things, then he will have proved the existence of an\n\u2018External World\u2019. Moore then maintains that he can do this\n\u2014\nHow? By holding up my two hands, and saying, as I make a\ncertain gesture with the right hand, \u2018Here is one hand\u2019,\nand adding, as I make a certain gesture with the left, \u2018and here\nis another\u2019 (\u2018Proof of an External World\u2019\n166).\n\n\nMoore then goes to argue that this demonstration of his hands was a\n\u2018perfectly rigorous\u2019 proof of the existence of external\nobjects. For its premises certainly entail its conclusion and they are\nthings which he then knew to be true \u2014\nI knew that there was one hand in the place\nindicated by combining a certain gesture with my first utterance of\n\u2018here\u2019 and that there was another in the different place\nindicated by combining a certain gesture with my second utterance of\n\u2018here\u2019. How absurd it would be to suggest that I did not\nknow it, but only believed it, and that perhaps it was not the case!\nYou might as well suggest that I do not know that I am now standing up\nand talking \u2014 that perhaps after all I'm not, and that it's not\nquite certain that I am! (\u2018Proof of an External World\u2019\n166)\n\n\nThe significance of this performance has been debated ever since\nMoore set it out. It is commonly supposed that Moore here sets himself\nto refute philosophical skepticism; and that his performance, though\nintriguing, is unsuccessful. But this interpretation is incorrect:\nMoore's avowed aim is to prove the existence of an external\nworld, not to prove his knowledge of the existence of an\nexternal world. Moore himself set this out clearly in a subsequent\ndiscussion of his lecture:\nI have sometimes distinguished between two different\npropositions, each of which has been made by some philosophers, namely\n(1) the proposition \u2018there are no material things\u2019 and (2)\nthe proposition \u2018Nobody knows for certain that there are any\nmaterial things\u2019. And in my latest British Academy lecture called\n\u2018Proof of an External World\u2019 \u2026 I implied with regard\nto the first of these propositions that it could be proved to\nbe false in such a way as this; namely, by holding up one of your hands\nand saying \u2018This hand is a material thing; therefore\nthere is at least one material thing\u2019. But with regard to the\nsecond of the two propositions \u2026. I do not think I have ever\nimplied that it could be proved to be false in any\nsuch simple way \u2026 (\u2018A Reply to my Critics\u2019\n668)\n\n\nSetting aside any anti-skeptical intent therefore, what needs\nassessment is the metaphysical significance of Moore's proof, as a\nproof of an \u2018external world\u2019. Clearly, everything here\ndepends on what is to count as \u2018external\u2019, in particular\nwhether Moore's demonstration of the existence of his hands proves the\nexistence of things that are in no way at all dependent upon experience\nor thought. It is, I think, obvious that it does not; for that issue is\none which depends on broader philosophical questions about idealism\nwhich cannot possibly be settled that way. Moore's own distinction\nbetween questions of truth and questions of analysis should be\nintroduced here. Moore's \u2018proof\u2019 demonstrates the\n\u2018empirical\u2019 truth of a simple truism, that he has hands;\nbut it leaves entirely open the question of the analysis of this\ntruism. Yet it is at the level of analysis that the\n\u2018transcendental\u2019 question of whether things such as hands\nare altogether independent of experience and thought is to be\nanswered.\n\n\nAlthough, as I have indicated, Moore did not intend his\n\u2018proof\u2019 as a refutation of skepticism, he did frequently\nargue against skeptical views; and in his early writings, despite the\npassage quoted just now, he does sometimes give the impression that he\nthinks one can refute skepticism by simply bringing forward a\nstraightforward case of knowledge, such as \u2018I know that this is a\npencil\u2019. But on examination it turns out that his strategy here\nis more subtle; he wants to argue that we get our understanding of\nknowledge primarily through straightforward cases of this kind, and\nthus that skeptical arguments are self-undermining: for, on the one\nhand, they rely on general principles about the limits of knowledge and\nthus assume some understanding of knowledge but, on the other hand,\nthey undermine this understanding by implying that there are no such\nstraightforward cases of it. The force of arguments of this kind is,\nhowever, disputable, since the skeptic can always present his argument\nas a reductio ad absurdum of the possibility of knowledge; and\nthe same point applies to Moore's other attempts to convict the skeptic\nof some kind of pragmatic incoherence.\n\n\nIn two of his last writings, \u2018Four Forms of Skepticism\u2019\nand \u2018Certainty\u2019, Moore, perhaps dissatisfied with these\nearlier arguments and with the misunderstanding of his\n\u2018proof\u2019, returned to the issue and set himself the\nchallenge of refuting Cartesian skepticism. Notoriously, by the end of\n\u2018Certainty\u2019 Moore acknowledges defeat: having agreed that\nif he does not know that he is not dreaming, then he does not know such\nthings as that he is standing up and talking, he accepts (with\nreservations) that he cannot know for certain that he is not dreaming.\nMost commentators agree that Moore lost his way here. But it is not\nclear where, since Moore makes no obvious mistake. Nonetheless the\nviability of a \u2018common sense\u2019 response to skepticism\nremains an important feature of later discussions of the topic. Moore\nwas clearly right when, for example, he remarked that despite Russell's\nfrequent skeptical professions, Russell was nonetheless perfectly sure,\nwithout a shadow of doubt, on thousands of occasions, that he was\nsitting down. But what is difficult to achieve here is a formulation of\nthe skeptical dialectic which both shows the importance of Moore's\n\u2018common sense\u2019 affirmations of certainty and yet avoids a\ndogmatic insistence that knowledge does not need to be vindicated in\nthe face of skeptical argument. I myself think that Wittgenstein's\nwritings On Certainty, which were much influenced by Moore,\nbest indicate how this is to be achieved, but this is not the place to\ndemonstrate this achievement.\n",
