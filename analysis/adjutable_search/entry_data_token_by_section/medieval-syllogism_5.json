    "main_text": "Richard of Campsall\n6. Richard of Campsall\n\nAn important figure in the history of syllogistic logic is Richard of\nCampsall (c. 1280/90\u20131350/60). Sometime before 1308 he wrote his\nQuestions on the Books of the Prior Analytics (Questiones\nsuper librum Priorum Analeticorum), a commentary on the first\nbook of the Prior Analytics that devotes 14 of its 20\nquestions to modal syllogistic. He seems to think that there is\nnothing to add to the theory of assertoric syllogistic and his\npresentation of it is fairly standard, but he has lots of interesting\nthings to say about modal syllogistic. \n\nThe main development of modal syllogistic in Campsall\u2019s work is his\nsystematic application of the distinction between composite (de\ndicto) and divided (de re) modal sentences. Campsall\nseems to have held that the system of modal syllogisms presented in\nthe Prior Analytics was intended for divided modal sentences,\nand so he tries to prove that what Aristotle said is basically correct\nwhen modal sentences are understood in this way. But this turns out to\nbe a very cumbersome task. It is no surprise that he does not quite\nsucceed, as he occasionally admits.\n\nIn his reply to one of the questions in his commentary, he makes a\nbrief remark about the difference between composite and divided modal\nsentences. With regard to universal negative necessity sentences he\nwrites: \u201c[Such a sentence] in the composite sense is singular\nand signifies that the inherence which it modifies is necessary; in\nthe divided sense it is universal and does not signify that the\ninherence that is modified is necessary, but solely that whatever is\ncontained under the predicate necessarily is removed from whatever is\ncontained under the subject\u201d (5.38: 110). The universal negative\nmodal sentence is singular when it is taken in the composite sense,\nthat is, when it is read so that the modality is predicated of what a\nnon-modal proposition expresses (dictum) or, as Campsall\nsays, when it is predicated of the inherence. He goes on to explain\nthat a necessity sentence in the composite sense signifies that the\ncorresponding non-modal sentence is necessarily true. \u2018That\nevery B is not A is necessary\u2019 is thus not universal but\nsingular. When the universal negative necessity proposition is taken\nin the divided sense, it is universal. The modality does not qualify\nthe dictum as a whole, but only the mode of removal of\nwhatever is under the predicate term from whatever is under the\nsubject term.\n\nBoth the conversion rules and the syllogisms for modal sentences in\nthe composite sense are validated by a small number of consequences,\nsuch as:\n\n(6:1)\nIf the antecedent is necessary, then the consequent is necessary.\n\n\nThe corresponding non-modal sentence is here assumed to be valid.\nSimilar consequences can be formed for possibility and contingency\nsentences. These exhaust the theory of syllogism for composite modal\nsentences and Campsall accordingly spends little time elaborating\nit.\n\nIt is natural to assume, as Campsall does, that Aristotle meant his\ntheory of modal syllogisms to cover divided modal sentences, since the\nreading of composite sentences Campsall proposes entails that they are\nall singular and that Aristotle\u2019s theory is not a theory for singular\nsentences. Therefore, he must show how the conversion rules can be\nmade to hold on such a reading of modal sentences.\n\nIn his attempt to give Aristotelian modal syllogistic a consistent\ninterpretation, Campsall is forced to adopt a very artificial reading\nof divided modal sentences. He is clearly influenced by the\nsuppositum approach suggested by Kilwardby, but he thinks\nthat both subject and predicate terms should be taken in this way.\nFurthermore, he states that the terms in divided modal sentences\nshould be taken as standing for that which is now under them. He\nbelieves that with these conditions, the conversion rules and almost\nall of the moods accepted by Aristotle can be shown to be valid.\n\nCampsall also thinks that on such a reading, the following holds:\n\n(6:2)\nC can be one of those that are now under B; therefore, it is one\nof those that are now under B.\n\n\nCampsall takes the terms to signify how things actually are now. If\nthe terms in the sentence \u2018A can be B\u2019 are taken to stand\nfor the things that are at this very moment under them, then \u2018A\ncan be B\u2019 means the same as \u2018A is B\u2019. According to\nCampsall, \u2018Socrates can be white\u2019 should read in the\ndivided sense \u2018That which is Socrates can now be one of those\nthat are now white\u2019. If that which is Socrates can be one of\nthose that are white now, it is one of them; otherwise, Socrates could\nnot have been that particular white being in the first place. Campsall\nthinks that Socrates can be this white being (B1) or that\nwhite being (B2) or \u2026, that is, (B1,\nB2, \u2026, Bn), and if Socrates is not\nactually B1 now, he is B2 now, etc., but\nSocrates will be one of B1 to Bn now. This is\nCampsall\u2019s reason for stating (6:2).\n\nThis is not as crazy as it might first seem. Consider the following\nschema in quantified modal logic:\n\n(6:3)\n\\(\\forall x (Bx \\amp \\Diamond(c = x) \\supset Bc)\\).\n\n\nIf (6:3) is an accurate interpretation of (6:2), then it seems true\nsince \\((\\Diamond(t = t') \\supset(t = t'))\\) is true for identity statements in Kripke\u2019s S5 if\n\\(t\\) and \\(t'\\) are rigid designators.\n\nGiven his interpretation of divided modal sentences and consequences\nlike (6:2), Campsall manages to prove the conversion rules. Like\nKilwardby, he approximates Aristotle\u2019s original system but in the end\ndoes not preserve all of its features. The most interesting features\nof Campsall\u2019s work, however, are not the result of his efforts to\nprove Aristotle right, but of his apparently successful solutions. His\nconcept of contingency allows for simultaneous alternatives, such that\nif something exists, it is possible for it not to exist at that very\nsame moment. Campsall thus abandons the fundamental Aristotelian\nprinciple of the necessity of the present (see Knuuttila 1993 and the\nentry on\n medieval theories of modality\n for discussion of criticisms of this principle in the late thirteenth\ncentury). But Campsall\u2019s analysis is complicated by the fact that, as\nwe have seen, he also accepts the principle that what can exist now\ndoes exist now, and that what does not exist now is necessarily\nnon-existent now. In other words, he denies the necessity of the\npresent for affirmative sentences and accepts it for negative ones.\nThere is thus an asymmetry between affirmative and negative modal\nsentences in Campsall\u2019s system.\n\nAccepting simultaneous alternatives and denying the necessity of the\npresent are typical of modal semantics and modal logic after Campsall,\nespecially in the work of figures such as William of Ockham and John\nBuridan. It is historically interesting that Campsall employs these\nprinciples in his work, even though they are embedded in a theory\nwhose elements point in another direction, towards Kilwardby.\nCampsall\u2019s problematization of the necessity of the present also\nindicates that he wants to separate logic from ontology. In many\nrespects, he paves the way for the next generation of logicians. His\ncomplicated interpretation also shows that no matter how hard one\nmight try, there is no way to give a consistent interpretation of what\nAristotle says in the Prior Analytics (for discussion, see\nLagerlund 2000, Thom 2003 and Knuuttila 2008).\n",
