    "main_text": "Implementation || Implementation for LoAs\n5.3 Implementation for LoAs\n\nPrimiero (2020) proposes a definition of implementation not as a\nrelation between two fixed levels, but one that is allowed to range\nover any LoA. Under this view, an implementation I is a\nrelation of instantiation holding between a LoA and any other\none higher in the abstraction hierarchy. Accordingly, a physical\ncomputing machine is an implementation of assembly/machine code\noperations; by transitivity, it can also be considered as an\ninstantiation of a set of instructions expressed in high-level\nprogramming language instructions. A program expressed in a high-level\nlanguage is an implementation of an algorithm; but it can also be\ntaken to be the instantiation of a set of specifications.\n\nSuch a definition of implementation allows Primiero (2020) to provide\na general definition of correctness: a physical computing system is\ncorrect if and only if it is characterized by correct implementations\nat any LoA. Hence correctness and implementation are coupled and\ndefined at any LoA. Functional correctness is the property of\na computational system that displays the functionalities required by\nthe specifications of that system. Procedural correctness\ncharacterizes computational systems displaying the functionalities\nintended by the implemented algorithms. And executional\ncorrectness is defined as the property of a system that is able\nto correctly execute the program on its architecture. Each of these\nforms of correctness can also be classified quantitatively, depending\non the amount of functionalities being satisfied. A functionally\nefficient computational system displays a minimal subset of\nthe functionalities required by the specifications; a functionally\noptimal system is able to display a maximal subset of those\nfunctionalities. Similarly, the author defines procedurally as well as\nexecutionally efficient and optimal computational systems.\n",
