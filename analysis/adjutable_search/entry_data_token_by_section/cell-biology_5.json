Bechtel (2000, 2006) highlights three\nconsiderations that often figured in scientists\u2019 evaluation of\nwhether micrographs were informative about cells or only artifacts of\nthe methods of preparation: (1) the quality of the micrographs\nthemselves\u2014do they exhibit distinct patterns? (2) the robustness\nof the results\u2014can comparable results be generated with\ndifferent techniques (e.g., with light and electron microscopy or with\nmultiple stains)? and (3) the theoretical plausibility of the\nresults\u2014do they fit into a coherent theoretical account? While\nthe first is seldom commented on in philosophical accounts, it is\nnotable that scientists are inclined to assume that if an image\nreveals a distinct, replicable pattern, it reflects something in the\nsource (although this assessment may be retracted if, for example, a\nresearcher shows how the pattern could be generated by other means).\nThere has been extensive philosophical discussion of the\nsecond\u2014the inference that when the same result is generated by\nindependent means, it reflects a preexisting entity in the world\n(Hacking 1983; Culp 1995; Stegenga & Menon 2017). However, this\ncriterion proves insufficient at just the point at which results with\nnew techniques, such as the electron microscope, are most\ncontroversial\u2014when the images contain structures beyond those\nthat can be detected with other existing techniques. In these cases,\nthe distinctness of the patterns together with considerations as to\nthe theoretical plausibility of the findings are the criteria\nresearchers can use. Appeal to theoretical plausibility, however,\nwould seem to be circular since in traditional philosophical accounts,\ntheories are tested by the evidence generated by the technique. But\ndeveloping a plausible theory that fits with an experimental finding\nand other evidence is not easy and when they are able to do so,\nscientists view it as buttressing their judgments that the images\nreflect real structures. To illustrate how these considerations have\nbeen invoked in in cell biology, we present two examples philosophers\nhave examined of conflicts over whether the structure shown in\nmicroscopic images was real or an artifact. The cases ended\ndifferently, one with the acceptance of the structure, one with its\nrejection.\n\nThe first case involves the Golgi apparatus, first described by Golgi\n(1898) in light microscope studies using the silver nitrate stain he\nhad introduced. Palade and Claude (1949a,b), two of the pioneers of\nmodern cell biology, who would ultimately share the Nobel Prize,\nargued that it was an artifact of staining, including with osmium\ntetroxide (which Palade helped establish as a primary stain for\nelectron microscopy). They appealed not only to the variable\nappearance of the Golgi bodies, as had some earlier skeptics\n(Strangeways & Canti 1927; Parat 1928; Baker 1944), but also to\ntheir own ability to create myelin figures similar in appearance to\nthe Golgi bodies by adding osmium to egg white. As discussed by\nBechtel (2006), this is compelling evidence for the claim that the\nGolgi apparatus is an artifact, but in this case the evidence was\neventually set aside without being refuted. Although Palade remained a\nskeptic about the Golgi apparatus for 15 years (researchers in his lab\nreported that they were not allowed to mention it during that\ninterval), he finally accepted its reality when researchers in his\nlaboratory demonstrated that many newly synthesized proteins pass\nthrough the region of the cell where the Golgi apparatus appeared on\ntheir way to being secreted. He did not, however, explain why he\nchanged his mind. This later research on the Golgi apparatus, but not\nhis earlier skepticism about the existence of the Golgi apparatus, was\nnoted in Palade\u2019s Nobel Prize citation in 1974. Palade himself\nlater contributed to two reviews (Farquhar & Palade 1981, 1998)\nthat discuss earlier researchers who cast doubts on the reality of the\nGolgi apparatus, but he never mentions his own claims that it was an\nartifact. What seems particularly salient is that, as a result of\nresearch in his laboratory, the Golgi apparatus was associated with a\nfunction in the cell in a manner that it had not been previously. It\nnow fit into a plausible theory in which it figured in packaging\nproteins for export from the cell. Bechtel argues that this is often a\nmajor factor in researchers\u2019 acceptance of the reality of\nentities identified through new techniques.\n\nThe second example stems from early electron microscopy of bacterial\ncells. Chapman and Hillier (1953) observed invaginations of the plasma\nmembrane in gram-negative bacteria, which they called peripheral\nbodies. Robertson (1958) renamed them mesosomes and they\nwere implicated by many researchers in a variety of cell functions\nbefore being rejected as artifacts in the 1970s (Silva et al. 1976).\nAnalyzing this example, Rasmussen (1993) argues that philosophical\ncriteria for distinguishing real entities from artifacts, such as\nrobustness, are insufficient to explain scientists\u2019 changing\njudgments about the mesosome. When Chapman and Hillier first made\ntheir case for the existence of mesosomes, they had to explain away\ndifferences between their micrographs and the observations of light\nmicroscopists by arguing that a membrane that only appeared in images\nwith the light microscope was in fact due to the mesosomes being\nimaged under low resolution. Rasmussen contends they offered this\nconvoluted argument rather than treating the mesosomes as an artifact\nbecause they were promoting the new electron microscopes. He further\ndescribes how their claims motivated research programs aimed at\npurifying and biochemically characterizing the mesosome so as to\nevaluate proposals regarding their function. This initially supported\nclaims to the mesosome\u2019s reality, but other biochemists offered\nconflicting evidence. In addition, another new technique for preparing\nspecimens for electron microscopy by freezing them, which had its own\npassionate advocates, generated micrographs that did not show\nmesosomes. According to Rasmussen, these competing findings, not\nrobustness, determined scientists\u2019 judgments about\nmesosomes.\n\nThe case of the mesosome has attracted substantial interest from other\nphilosophers of science. Culp (1994) challenged Rasmussen\u2019s\ninterpretation of the history of mesosomes, contending that the\nrejection of mesosomes as an artifact is in fact best explained on\ngrounds of robustness. In particular, she points to the combined data\nfrom biochemists that revealed few differences between cytoplasmic\nmembranes and specimens supposedly from mesosomes and from a new\ngeneration of electron microscopists that suggested that mesosomes\nresulted from the fixative, glutaraldehyde, used to generate the\nmicrographs purporting to show them. These robustness considerations,\nshe claims, sufficed to lead the community to reject mesosomes. In a\nlater paper, Rasmussen responds to Culp\u2019s analysis, continuing\nto maintain that local details, not principles like robustness,\ndetermine scientists\u2019 judgments about artifacts: \n\n\ngeneral principles like robustness are too vague to warrant anything\nwhatsoever, because when described in sufficient detail it emerges\nthat the way such principles are instantiated is in flux\u2014and the\ndevil is in the details. (2001: 643) \n\n\nSeveral other philosophers have also taken up the case of the\nmesosome. Allchin (2000) characterizes the initial evidence for the\nmesosome as robust and describes how subsequent research showing how\nparticles were generated by degeneration of the membrane in\npreparation for electron microscopy led to a reassessment, culminating\nin mesosomes being recognized as artifacts. Weber (2005) argues that\nthe process of evaluating claims about artifacts employs causal\nreasoning of the same sort as used in testing theoretical hypotheses.\nAccording to him, mesosomes were judged to be artifacts when evidence\nsupported the claim that they were produced by chemical fixation.\nHudson (2014: chapter 2) advances yet another alternative: according\nto which what mattered most to researchers was whether they regarded\nthe process for generating evidence for or against mesosomes as a\nreliable process.\n",
