    "main_text": "Contemporary Hermeneutics\n4. Contemporary Hermeneutics\n\nContemporary hermeneutics is largely shaped by Hans-Georg\nGadamer\u2019s \u2018philosophical hermeneutics.\u2019\nGadamer\u2019s approach is guided by the insight that the success of\nunderstanding involves a distinctive experience of truth. Consider,\nonce more, the example of coming to understand something through an\ninterpretation of Thucydides\u2019 History of the Peloponnesian\nWar, namely, that in politics, prudent reasoning is not always\npersuasive enough to stem the tide of war. When I come to understand\nthis, so goes Gadamer\u2019s insight, I experience what I understand\nnot simply as a novel or enriching idea. Rather, I experience what I\nhave understood as something that makes a claim to be true. Thus, to\nunderstand something means to understand something as true. The chief\nissue of Gadamer\u2019s philosophical hermeneutics is to clarify that\nsuch a hermeneutical experience of truth is not only valid in its own\nright, but that it is distinct from, and even more original than, the\nsense of truth at issue in knowledge secured through the norms and\nmethods of modern science. Indeed, it is precisely this concern that\nGadamer\u2019s title of his magnum opus is meant to evoke:\nhis philosophical hermeneutics focuses on a hermeneutical experience\nof truth that cannot be derived from scientific\nmethod.\n",
