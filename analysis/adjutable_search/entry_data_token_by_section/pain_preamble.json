    "main_text": "\n\nPain is the most prominent member of a class of sensations known as\nbodily sensations, which includes itches, tickles, tingles, orgasms,\nand so on. Bodily sensations are typically attributed to bodily\nlocations and appear to have features such as volume, intensity,\nduration, and so on, that are ordinarily attributed to physical\nobjects or quantities. Yet these sensations are often thought to be\nlogically private, subjective, self-intimating, and the source of\nincorrigible knowledge for those who have them. Hence there appear to\nbe reasons both for thinking that pains (along with other similar\nbodily sensations) are physical objects or conditions that we perceive\nin body parts, and for thinking that they are not. This apparent\nparadox is one of the main reasons why philosophers are especially\ninterested in pain. One increasingly popular but still controversial\nway to deal with this apparent paradox is to defend a perceptual or\nrepresentational view of pain, according to which feeling pain is in\nprinciple no different from undergoing other standard perceptual\nprocesses like seeing, hearing, touching, etc. But there are many who\nthink that pains are not amenable to such a treatment. Although it was\nthe treatment of pain as a sensory-discriminative experience that had\ndominated the philosophical discussions throughout most of the\ntwentieth century, attention to pains\u2019 affective-motivational\ndimension has gained prominence in recent years. \n",
