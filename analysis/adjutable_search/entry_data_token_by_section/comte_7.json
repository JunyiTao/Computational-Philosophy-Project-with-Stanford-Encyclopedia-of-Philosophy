    "main_text": "The Course on Positive Philosophy and the Friendship with Mill || Comte and Mill\n4.4 Comte and Mill\n\nThe Course\u2019s first readers were in Great Britain; the\nreform projects of the English Radicals had many points in common with\nthe positivist concerns. A reading of the first volumes made enough of\nan impression on Mill to induce him to write to their author. The\ncorrespondence that followed, which lasted from 1841 to 1846, is of\nconsiderable philosophical interest. In his first letter, Mill\npresents himself almost as a follower of Comte and recalls how, some\nten years before, it had been Comte\u2019s 1822 work that had\nliberated him from Bentham\u2019s\n influence.[4]\n But the tone of the letters, while remaining friendly, changes\nshortly thereafter. Mill does not hesitate to voice objections to\nComte\u2019s conception of biology and his excluding psychology from\nthe sciences. In particular, Mill had strong reservations about\nGall\u2019s phrenology, which Comte endorsed, and proposed to replace\nit with ethology. Their disagreements crystallize around \u2018la\nquestion f\u00e9minine\u2019\u2014that is, the status of women in\nsociety\u2014 where it is possible to see how epistemological and\npolitical considerations are linked (Guillin 2007).\n\nAfter 1846, Mill quickly distanced himself from his correspondent. He\neven went so far to describe the Syst\u00e8me as \u201cthe\ncompletest system of spiritual and temporal despotism which ever yet\nemanated from a human brain, unless possibly that of Ignatius\nLoyola\u201d (Autobiography, 213). Such judgments\u2014and\nthere are many\u2014 represent an extreme in a much more balanced\nglobal assessment. Comte\u2019s later philosophy deserves criticism,\nbut Mill was able to see its strong points and mention them. The last\nsentences of Mill\u2019s 1865 book give a good example of the unique\nway he manages to mix approval and harsh criticism:\n\nWe think M. Comte as great as either of these philosophers [Descartes\nand Leibniz], and hardly more extravagant. Were we to speak of our\nwhole mind, we should call him superior to them: not intrinsically,\nbut by the exertion of equal intellectual power in an age less\ntolerant of palpable absurdities, and to which those he has committed,\nif not in themselves greater, at least appear more ridiculous (Mill\n1865, p. 182).\n\n\nAnd earlier, he said:\n\nWe, therefore, not only hold that M. Comte was justified in the\nattempt to develop his philosophy into a religion, and had realized\nthe essential conditions of one, but that other religions are made\nbetter in proportion as, in their practical result, they are brought\nto coincide with that which he aimed at constructing. But, unhappily,\nthe next thing we are obliged to do, is to charge him with making a\ncomplete mistake at the very outset of his operations. (Mill 1865, p.\n124)\n\n\nEven though each new edition of Mill\u2019s System of Logic\nsaw fewer references to the Course than the previous one (in\nthe first edition there had been more than a hundred), Comte\u2019s\ninfluence on Mill ran deep, the extent to which is greatly\nunderestimated today (Raeder 2002). Mill\u2019s\nAutobiography is quite explicit on this point as Comte\nfigures much more prominently in it than Tocqueville with whom Mill\nhad been in contact for a longer time. Conversely, Mill contributed\nmuch to the spreading of positivism. His book on Comte (Mill 1865)\nenjoyed considerable success, and Mill himself was sometimes\nconsidered a\n positivist.[5]\n",
