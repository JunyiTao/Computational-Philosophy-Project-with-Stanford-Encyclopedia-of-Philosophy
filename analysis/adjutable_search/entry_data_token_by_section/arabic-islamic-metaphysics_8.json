    "main_text": "Post-Avicennian Period\n9. Conclusion\n\nThe study of Arabic metaphysics can be approached from a variety of\ninterconnected perspectives. On the one hand, a group of historical\nissues emerges, such as the ways according to which the\nMetaphysics was transmitted into Arabic and integrated in the\nculture of its new environment, the synergy of its transmission with\nthe Arabic reception of other fundamental works of Aristotle (above\nall the Posterior Analytics, but also the\nCategories), and the continuation in Arabic philosophy of the\nmain Greek paradigms of interpretation of the Aristotelian\ncorpus, such as the Athenian background of\nal-Kind\u012b\u2019s philosophy vs. the Alexandrian heritage of the\nAristotelians of Baghdad, or the purer Peripatetism of\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b vs. the Platonizing Aristotelianism of\nYa\u1e25y\u0101 Ibn \u02bfAd\u012b and his followers. On the other\nhand, the epistemological reflection on metaphysics as a science\nundertaken by Arabic philosophers, in the effort to transform\nAristotle\u2019s still imperfect discipline into a full-fledged and\nrigorous scientific discourse, discloses a theoretical area of\ninvestigation that produces a progressive switch of attention from the\nMetaphysics (with capital \u201cM\u201d) to metaphysics\n(with lower-case \u201cm\u201d). Outside the narrower scope of\nphilosophy and its history, it is interesting to note how the\nintroduction of a foreign pagan discipline, like metaphysics, into a\nmonotheistic social context, like the Islamic one, determines either\nthe accordance or the antagonism between philosophical theology and\nrevealed theology, or, in other words, between the quintessence of\nfalsafa, on the one hand, and the speculation of\nkal\u0101m, on the other. The study of the ways in which this\nconfrontation took place in the Islamic culture of the Middle Ages may\nshed light on the contemporary debate on the relationship between\nreason and faith and contribute to the promotion of dialogue among\ndifferent cultures.\n",
