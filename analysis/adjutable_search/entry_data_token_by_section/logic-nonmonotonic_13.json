    "main_text": "Non-monotonic logic and human reasoning\n5. Conclusion\n\nThere are three major issues connected with the development of logical\nframeworks that can adequately represent defeasible reasoning:\n(i) material adequacy; (ii) formal properties; and\n(iii) complexity. A non-monotonic formalism is materially\nadequate to the extent to which it captures examples of defeasible\nreasoning and to the extent to which it has intuitive properties. The\nquestion of formal properties has to do with the degree to which the\nformalism gives rise to a consequence relation that satisfies\ndesirable theoretic properties such as the above mentioned\nReflexivity, Cut, and Cautious Monotony. The third set of issues has\nto do with computational complexity of the most basic questions\nconcerning the framework. \n\nThere is a potential tension between (i) and (ii): the\ndesire to capture a broad range of intuitions can lead to ad\nhoc solutions that can sometimes undermine the desirable formal\nproperties of the framework. In general, the development of NMLs and\nrelated formalisms has been driven, since its inception, by\nconsideration (i) and has relied on a rich and well-chosen\narray of examples. Of course, there is some question as to whether any\nsingle framework can aspire to be universal in this respect. \n\nMore recently, researchers have started paying attention to\nconsideration (ii), looking at the extent to which NMLs have\ngenerated well-behaved relations of logical consequence. As\n Makinson (1994)\n points out, practitioners of the field have encountered mixed\nsuccess. In particular, one abstract property, Cautious Monotony,\nappears at the same time to be crucial and elusive for many of the\nframeworks to be found in the literature. This is a fact that is\nperhaps to be traced back, at least in part, to the above-mentioned\ntension between the requirement of material adequacy and the need to\ngenerate a well-behaved consequence relation. \n\nThe complexity issue appears to be the most difficult among the ones\nthat have been singled out. NMLs appear to be stubbornly intractable\nwith respect to the corresponding problem for classical logic. This is\nclear in the case of default logic, given the ubiquitous consistency\nchecks. But besides consistency checks, there are other, often\noverlooked, sources of complexity that are purely combinatorial. Other\nforms of non-monotonic reasoning, besides default logic, are far from\nimmune from these combinatorial roots of intractability. Although some\nimportant work has been done trying to make various non-monotonic\nformalisms more tractable, this is perhaps the problem on which\nprogress has been slowest in coming. \n",
