    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\nWilliam Heytesbury was most likely born before 1313 in Wiltshire\n(Salisbury Diocese). He is first mentioned as a fellow at Merton\nCollege in Oxford in 1330; he is thus among the second generation of\nOxford Calculators (a follower of Thomas Bradwardine and Richard\nKilvington, a contemporary of John Dumbleton and Roger Swyneshed, and\na predecessor of Richard Swineshead). He held the administrative\nposition of a bursar of Merton in 1338\u20131339, responsible for\ndetermining dues, auditing accounts, and collecting\n revenues.[1]\n By 1340 he had completed his regency in arts at Merton and, together\nwith John Dumbleton, was named a foundation fellow at the new\nQueen\u2019s College in 1340, but was soon mentioned among the\nfellows of Merton College again. He is recorded as having become a\nDoctor of Theology in 1348, yet none of his theological works are\nknown. He was chancellor of the University in 1371\u201372 (and\nperhaps also in 1353\u201354) and died shortly thereafter, between\nDecember 1372 and January\n 1373.[2]\n\nHeytesbury\u2019s extant writings, which are currently agreed to have\noriginated in 1330s, typically develop a certain logical or physical\ntheory through analysing sophisms. For most of these texts, there is a\nmodern (in some cases critical) edition, some are available in\nincunabular editions and early prints, and several modern translations\nare available. There is a spectrum of works based on how certain their\nauthenticity is in the present state of research. These break down to\nthree categories, such that shifts between them in the future are\npossible (albeit unlikely in some cases):\n\nWorks agreed to be authentic:\n\nRegulae solvendi sophismata [RSS] or Logica\nSophismata [Soph]\nSophismata asinina [SophAs]\nIuxta hunc textum [IHT] or Consequentiae\nHeytesbury\nDe sensu composito et diviso [SCD]\n\n\nRegulae solvendi sophismata [RSS] or Logica (a\ncollection of six treatises: on paradoxes, on knowing and doubting, on\nrelative terms, on beginning and ceasing, on maxima and minima, and on\nthe speed of motions) is concerned with instructions for solving\ndifferent types of sophisms in the first year of logical studies. In a\nway, [RSS] is a paradigm of authenticity for Heytesbury\u2019s works\n(mutual coherence being used as the criterion of authenticity).\nSophismata [Soph] is a collection of sophisms for advanced\nstudents working on natural philosophy. Sophismata asinina\n[SophAs] is a collection of sophistical proofs that the reader is a\ndonkey. Iuxta hunc textum [IHT], also known as\nConsequentiae Heytesbury, is a collection of sophisms\ndesigned for testing formal inference rules. De sensu composito et\ndiviso [SCD] is a manual on the logical analysis of the de\nre/de dicto ambiguity.\n\nWorks of uncertain authenticity:\n\nProbationes conclusionum\nCasus obligationis [CO]\nDe propositionibus multiplicibus or De propositionum\nmultiplicium significatione\nTermini naturales\n\n\nProbationes conclusionum follows [RSS] and analyses sophisms\nof various kinds. Casus obligationis [CO] is a collection of\nepistemic sophisms, related to the second chapter of [RSS]. De\npropositionibus multiplicibus is a short treatise on the analysis\nand inferential roles of various kinds of sentences. Termini\nnaturales is a vocabulary of elementary physics, very popular in\nthe late-medieval\n period.[3]\n\nWorks which have been erroneously attributed to Heytesbury in\nthe past:\n\nDe veritate et falsitate propositionis (authored by Henry\nHopton)\n\n\nDe veritate et falsitate propositionis is a treatise on\nsentential semantics motivated by the analysis of the sophism\n\u201cEvery sentence is true or\n false\u201d.[4]\n\n",
