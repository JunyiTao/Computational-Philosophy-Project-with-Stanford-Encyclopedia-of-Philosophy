    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\nIn his Lives of the Philosophers (Diels-Kranz, testimonium\nA1), Diogenes Laertius reports that Xenophanes was born in the small\nIonian town of Colophon and flourished during the sixtieth Olympiad\n(540\u2013537 BCE). Laertius adds that when Xenophanes was\n\u201cbanished from his native city\u201d he \u201cjoined the\ncolony planted at Elea\u201d (in Italy), and also lived at Zancle and\nCatana (two Greek communities in Sicily). He credits Xenophanes with\ncomposing verses \u201cin epic meter, as well as elegiacs and iambics\nattacking Hesiod and Homer and denouncing what they said about the\ngods\u201d, with reciting his own works, and with composing poems on\nthe founding of Colophon and Elea. Later writers add that \u201che\nburied his sons with his own hands\u201d, was sold into slavery, and\nlater released from it. By Xenophanes\u2019 own account (B8) he\n\u201ctossed about the Greek land\u201d for sixty-seven years,\nstarting at the age of twenty-five.\n\nDiels-Kranz (DK) provides 45 fragments of his poetry (although B4, 13,\n19, 20, 21 and 41 would be more accurately classified as\ntestimonia), ranging from the 24 lines of B1 to the\nsingle-word fragments of B21a, 39, and 40. A number of the\n\u2018sympotic poems\u2019 (poems for drinking parties) (B1\u20133,\n5, 6, 22, and the imitation in C2) were preserved by Athenaeus, while\nthe remarks on the nature of the divine were quoted by Clement\n(B14\u201316 and 23), Sextus Empiricus (B11, 12, and 24), and\nSimplicius (B25 and 26). Other snippets survive in the accounts by\nDiogenes Laertius and A\u00ebtius, or as marginal notes in our\nmanuscripts of various authors, or as entries in later rhetorical\nsummaries and dictionaries. Seventy-four selections, of which the most\nextensive is the pseudo-Aristotelian treatise On Melissus,\nXenophanes, Gorgias (MXG), make up the collection of\ntestimonia in DK. Laertius\u2019 statement (A1) that\nXenophanes \u201cwrote in epic meter, also elegiacs, and\niambics\u201d is confirmed by extant poems in hexameters and elegiac\nmeter, with one couplet (B14) a combination of hexameter and iambic\ntrimeter. Ancient writers referred to a number of his compositions as\nsilloi\u2014\u2018squints\u2019 or satires, and a critical\ntone pervades many of the surviving fragments. Three late sources\ncredit Xenophanes with a didactic poem under the title Peri\nPhuse\u00f4s (\u201cOn Nature\u201d) but not every allusion to\nan earlier author\u2019s views \u201con nature\u201d represented a\nreference to a single work on that subject.\n",
