    "main_text": "\n\nIn this article we provide a brief overview of the logic of action in philosophy, linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence. The logic of action is the formal study of action in which formal languages are the main tool of analysis.\n\nThe concept of action is of central interest to many disciplines: the social sciences including economics, the humanities including history and literature, psychology, linguistics, law, computer science, artificial intelligence, and probably others. In philosophy it has been studied since the beginning because of its importance for epistemology and, particularly, ethics; and since a few decades it is even studied for its own sake. But it is in the logic o faction that action is studied in the most abstract way.\n\nThe logic of action began in philosophy. But it has also played a certain role in linguistics. And currently it is of great importance in computer science and artificial intelligence. For our purposes it is natural to separate the accounts of these developments.\n",
