    "main_text": "\n\nSamuel Freiherr von Pufendorf (1632\u20131694) was almost as unknown\nduring most of the 19th and 20th centuries as he had been familiar\nduring the preceding hundred years and more. His fate shows well how\nphilosophical interests shape historical background narratives. More\nor less consciously, individual thinkers and the traditions they spawn\nframe themselves in terms of an edited past which \u2013 as in other\nforms of genealogy \u2013 they either appropriate, reject, revise, or\nignore. Thus intellectual ancestry is always more controversial than\nbiological inheritance, and the mere presence or absence of thinkers\nin particular developmental accounts is not necessarily an accurate\nindication of their actual historical role or importance.\n\nPufendorf\u2019s thought is situated in post-Westphalian Europe, as\nthe Holy Roman Empire underwent a reconfiguration of power\nrelationships among its quasi-autonomous constituent states (Austria,\nBavaria, Palatinate, Saxony, Brandenburg, and others), while\nmaintaining a guarded posture toward external, competing powers such\nas France, England, the United Provinces, Sweden, Denmark, Poland, and\nSpain. Its main goals were to avoid relapse into confessional warfare,\nand to ward off the respective French and Ottoman threats on its\nwestern and eastern borders. In this context Pufendorf developed a\ntheory about the moral relationships of agents (individuals and\ngroups), the authority and duties of states, and the lawful\ninteractions among these. His chief objective, too, was to avoid\ndestructive social conflict and the devolution on any level into the\nantagonistic and, he thought, self-defeating condition known as the\nstate of nature.\n\nPufendorf\u2019s approach was secular, non-metaphysical, and\nanti-authoritarian; it eschewed religious appeals, scholastic dogma,\nessentialism, teleology, and the frequent mix of these that appealed\nto many German thinkers, Catholic and Protestant alike. Instead, it\nbuilt on Bodin, Lipsius, Grotius, Hobbes, and the Italian\nreason-of-state tradition. Because of it, Pufendorf is known as a\nvoluntarist in ethics, a sovereignty theorist in politics, and a\nrealist in international relations theory. His kind of natural law is\ncalled \u2018modern\u2019 or \u2018Protestant\u2019 (Tuck 1987,\nHaakonssen 2004), in contrast to the metaphysical, neoscholastic,\nrationalist, or even Platonic version of the genre represented not\nonly by the School of Salamanca (Suarez, Vitoria) but also Leibniz and\nthen Wolff. Known as a philosopher and a jurist, Pufendorf was also a\nrespected historian whose accounts of (mostly, the external relations\nof) various European states exemplified his basic philosophical\nconcepts. He wrote notably on church-state relations, on intellectual\nand religious toleration, and on the Baconian theme of innovation in\nphilosophy. Because of the clarity and comprehensiveness of his works,\ntheir intellectual acuity, and their polemical edge and consequent\nnotoriety, they were translated into many European languages and thus\nprovided \u2013 often in the form of pedagogical tools \u2013 many\nof the basic concepts and distinctions operative in the 18th-century\ndiscourse about morality, society, politics, history, and\ninternational affairs. Indeed, both directly and through his many\neditors, translators, and imitators, Pufendorf was largely responsible\nfor the so-called ubiquity of natural law as a shared discourse during\nthe following century (Haakonssen 2012).\n",
