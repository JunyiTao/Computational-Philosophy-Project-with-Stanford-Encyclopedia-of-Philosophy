    "main_text": "The Neo-Confucian Era || Institutional vs. Character-centered Theories of Governance\n4.2 Institutional vs. Character-centered Theories of Governance\n\nMost basically, China\u2019s governmental structure in the\nNeo-Confucian era has four parts: (1) the emperor, imperial family,\nand inner-court attendants like eunuchs; (2) the outer-court\nministers, bureaucracy, and the literati families who staff them; (3)\nthe common people; and (4) the institutions that help to shape the\nways in which (1)\u2013(3) interact. One of the great debates of the\nNeo-Confucian era is about the relative importance or priority of\ninstitutions. This debate takes on many guises, but at bottom is the\nsense that there is a tension between two ways of understanding the\nstructure that undergirds a well-ordered society. One sees\ninstitutions and their component parts (traditions, rules, and\nregulations, etc.) as more fundamental. The other sees the people who\ndirect and belong to the institutions, and particularly the character\nof such people (understood as a combination of talents and ethical\ndispositions), as more fundamental. Where a philosopher stands on this\nissue can help to explain how they align on other critical issues in\nmatters of governance. Those who tend to see institutions as more\nfundamental are more inclined to see legal and regulatory reform as\nthe primary way of addressing large-scale problems. Those who see the\ncharacter of people as more fundamental often think the solution to\nsuch problems lies in moral cultivation and transformation (in\nparticular, of the emperor himself). To a certain extent, the former\nthink that institutions should be designed to take human flaws and\nshortcomings into account, so that the state does not require large\nnumbers of people to be virtuous in order to create social order,\nwhile the latter tend to worry that institutions designed for flawed\npeople will, at least at certain levels, inhibit the kind of\nself-improvement that makes government truly transformative. For ease\nof reference, let us use the term \u201ccharacter-centered\u201d and\n\u201cinstitutionalist\u201d to refer to these two positions.\n\nOn one somewhat simplistic historical account, most Neo-Confucians\nadvocate a character-centered theory of politics, holding that ethical\ncultivation of people and not institutional reform is the most\nplausible means of restoring social order. This is supposedly what\nprecipitated the \u201cInward Turn\u201d described above,\nencouraging individuals to abandon interest in state governance and\nfocus instead on their own moral self-improvement. This version of\nhistory is not entirely misleading. Neo-Confucians of the Southern\nSong frequently blame the fall of the Northern Song on its failed\nexperiments in institutional reform, especially those of the\ninstitutionalist thinker and statesman Wang Anshi (1021\u20131086).\nAnd the most famous Neo-Confucian philosophers tended to make\npronouncements more consistent with the character-centered theory,\nincluding the Cheng brothers, Zhu Xi, and Wang Yangming.\n\nBut the truth is quite a bit more complicated, and more\nphilosophically interesting. From the Song dynasty all the way through\nthe Qing, the Neo-Confucians counted among their ranks many thinkers\ninterested in \u201cstatecraft (jingshi)\u201d. By the late\nMing dynasty and thereafter, \u201cstatecraft\u201d came to describe\nalmost any method or techniques that could be used for the practical\noperations of the state, construed so expansively as to include\nmathematics and history. But in the narrower sense common among\nearlier Neo-Confucians, it refers to a philosophical position that\naims to address social problems through institutional reform rather\nthan through dramatic transformations of character. Scholars sometimes\ndescribe these thinkers as belonging to a \u201cStatecraft\nSchool\u201d which includes Song philosophers like Chen Liang\n(1143\u20131194) and Ye Shi (1150\u20131223), and the Ming\nNeo-Confucian Wang Tingxiang (1474\u20131544) (Niu 1998; Tillman\n1982; Ong 2006). It also includes reform-minded Neo-Confucians who\nlived through the downfall of the Ming and the rise of the Qing\ndynasty, such as Gu Yanwu (1613\u20131682) and Huang Zongxi\n(1610\u20131695). Even for more character-centered Confucians, what\nit meant to say that people\u2019s character is more fundamental than\ninstitutions was open to debate.\n\nTo understand the nuances of the resulting debates, it helps to begin\nby recalling the classical Confucian philosopher Xunzi, famous as a\ndefender of the character-centered view; as noted above, he holds that\n\u201cThere are people who create order; there are no standards\ncreating order of themselves\u201d. Discoursing on Xunzi\u2019s\nclaim gives Neo-Confucians opportunities to develop new ways of\nexplaining how the character of people can be prior to institutions.\nOne crucial elaboration is made by Hu Hong (1106\u20131161). On\nHu\u2019s view, people enter into the explanatory order of governance\nat two levels: first, they are the ones who implement the rules and\nregulations. At this level Hu\u2019s analysis closely follows\nXunzi\u2019s, stressing the necessary vagueness of law and the need\nto have skillful magistrates who understand individual laws in a\nsystematic way. But secondly, the people are also the ones who fix the\nrules whenever the rules are not suited to the circumstances. That is,\nhumans govern not just as executives but as originators too:\n\n\nXunzi said, \u201cThere are people who create order; there are no\nstandards that create order\u201d. I humbly submit that we illustrate\nthis by drawing an analogy between wanting to restore order after a\nperiod of chaos, and trying to cross a river or lake [by boat]. The\nrules are like the boat and the people [i.e. the ruler and his\nofficials] are like the steersman. If the boat is damaged and the\nrudder is broken, then even if [the steersman] has seemingly divine\ntechnique everyone nevertheless understands that the boat cannot get\nacross. So whenever there is a period of great disorder it is\nnecessary to reform the rules. There has never been a case where one\ncould successfully restore order without reforming the rules. (HHJ pp.\n23\u201324)\n\n\nIn short, for Hu, people bear credit for successful governance not\njust by guiding the institution correctly, but also by creating and\nmodifying the very rules on which governance is founded. Credit goes\nnot just to the steersmen but to the shipwrights as well.\n\nAlthough human discretion may allow people of talent and good\ncharacter to update rules or apply them differently in different\ncontexts, they also allow people who lack talent and good character to\nmisuse them. In these cases, it helps to set limits to abuses of\nauthority and leadership by requiring that leaders adhere to rules.\nThe philosopher who argues for this view most forcefully is Huang\nZongxi, who lived in the late Ming and early Qing. In a remarkable\nessay titled \u201cOn Standards (Yuanfa)\u201d, Huang\nmaintains that we should distinguish between legitimate and\nillegitimate standards, where the illegitimate ones are distinguished\nby the fact that they are created or modified primarily to serve the\ninterests of rulers. Huang says that what gives rules legitimacy is\nthe purpose for which they are fashioned, not just tradition or the\nduty to respect the ancestors who fashioned them. When rules are\ndesigned with the interests of the people in mind they tend to be\nloose and open-ended, for their purpose is not just to control human\nbehavior but also to cultivate virtues. People are more likely to\ndevelop virtuous character traits if their orderly conduct is done\nwillingly rather than under threat, and they are more likely to act\nwillingly if they are brought up under a regime of rules that protects\ntheir interests. Ironically, it is the rules of self-serving\nauthorities that require greater and greater stringency. Because they\nrely heavily on coercion and work against the welfare of ordinary\npeople, the policy makers have to create one layer of rules that\ngovern human conduct, then a second layer of rules establishing\ninstitutions to enforce the first, then a third layer of rules to\nenforce those in the second, and so on. The result is a regime with\nconsiderably less flexibility and room for human discretion than the\nproponents of the Xunzian principle envision (YF p. 317).\n",
