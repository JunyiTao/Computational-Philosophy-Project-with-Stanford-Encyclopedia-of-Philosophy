    "main_text": "The Later Wittgenstein || Grammar and Form of Life\n3.6 Grammar and Form of Life\n\nGrammar, usually taken to consist of the rules of correct syntactic\nand semantic usage, becomes, in Wittgenstein\u2019s hands, the\nwider\u2014and more elusive\u2014notion which captures the essence\nof language as a special rule-governed activity. This notion replaces\nthe stricter and purer logic, which played such an essential role in\nthe Tractatus in providing a scaffolding for language and the\nworld. Indeed, \u201cEssence is expressed in grammar\n\u2026 Grammar tells what kind of object anything is. (Theology as\ngrammar)\u201d (PI 371, 373). As opposed to grammar-book\nrules, the \u201crules\u201d of grammar are not technical\ninstructions from on-high for correct usage and are not idealized as\nan external system to be conformed to, independently of context.\nTherefore, they are not appealed to explicitly in any formulation, but\nare only used in cases of philosophical perplexity to clarify where\nlanguage misleads us into false illusions. Thus, for example, \u201cI\ncan know what someone else is thinking, not what I am thinking. It is\ncorrect to say \u2018I know what you are thinking,\u2019 and wrong\nto say \u2018I know what I am thinking.\u2019 (A whole cloud of\nphilosophy condensed into a drop of grammar.)\u201d\n(Philosophical Investigations 1953, p.222). In this example,\nbeing sensitive to the grammatical uniqueness of first-person avowals\nsaves us from the blunders of foundational epistemology.\n\nGrammar is hence situated within the regular activity with which\nlanguage-games are interwoven: \u201c\u2026 the word\n\u2018language-game\u2019 is used here to emphasize the\nfact that the speaking of language is part of an activity, or\nof a form of life\u201d (PI 23). What enables language to\nfunction and therefore must be accepted as \u201cgiven\u201d are\nprecisely forms of life. In Wittgenstein\u2019s terms, \u201cIt is\nnot only agreement in definitions but also (odd as it may sound) in\njudgments that is required\u201d (PI 242), and this is\n\u201cagreement not in opinions, but rather in form of life\u201d\n(PI 241). Used by Wittgenstein sparingly\u2014five times in\nthe Investigations\u2014this concept has given rise to\ninterpretative quandaries and subsequent contradictory readings. Forms\nof life can be understood as constantly changing and contingent,\ndependent on culture, context, history, etc.; or as a background\ncommon to humankind, \u201cshared human behavior\u201d which is\n\u201cthe system of reference by means of which we interpret an\nunknown language\u201d (PI 206); or as a notion which can be\nread differently in different cases \u2013 sometimes as relativistic,\nin other cases as expressing a more universalistic approach.\n",
