    "main_text": "Different Flavors of Adaptationism || Explanatory Adaptationism\n2.2 Explanatory Adaptationism\n\n\n Godfrey-Smith (2001, page 336) defined\nexplanatory adaptationism in this way: \u201cThe apparent design of\norganisms, and the relations of adaptedness between organisms and their\nenvironments, are the big questions, the amazing facts in\nbiology. Explaining these phenomena is the core intellectual mission of\nevolutionary theory. Natural selection is the key to solving these\nproblems; selection is the big answer. Because it answers the\nbiggest questions, selection has unique explanatory importance among\nevolutionary factors.\u201d\n\n\n Explanatory adaptationism is viewed\nby its proponents (e.g., Dawkins 1976, Dennett 1995, and Griffiths\n2009) as important because it organizes research to understand how\nnatural selection underlies the world around us. To this extent, it can\nbe viewed as an untestable aesthetic claim, instead of as a scientific\nclaim. At minimum, it is a claim as to the proper goal of science as a\nmanifestation of human reason and enlightenment. Amundson (1988, 1990)\nclaims that explanatory adaptationism is a stance about the natural\nworld and the products of scientific inquiry, instead of being a view\nabout biology or how best to do science. However, explanatory\nadaptationism may have normative implications for evolutionary\nbiologists, if adopting it is necessary in order to construct sensible\nexplanations in developmental biology and physiology (Griffiths\n2009). Viewed as an aesthetic claim, explanatory adaptationism\nhas no practical implications for science, but it does have\nimplications for the public debate about the relevance of biology to\nour image of humanity. In particular, Dennett and Dawkins argue\nthat this perspective counters the natural theological argument from\ndesign and vindicates a secular humanist perspective.\n\n\n Biologists not advocating explanatory\nadaptationism view the central mission of evolutionary biology\ndifferently. For example, many systematists believe that\ndescribing the history of life is the central mission of evolutionary\nbiology; in doing so, one might be agnostic about the evolutionary\nforces influencing this history (see Hull 1988 and Felsenstein 2004 for\nfurther details).\n",
