    "main_text": "The Practice: Three-Step Process || The Adjustment of Breathing\n3.2 The Adjustment of Breathing\n\nThe benefits of Zen meditation are closely tied to the practice of\nbreathing. Generally speaking, Zen doesn\u2019t recommend any\ncomplicated, strenuous breathing exercises as in Yoga. Zen\u2019s\nbreathing exercise is called \u201cobservation of breath count\u201d\n(s\u016bsokukan). In this exercise, the practitioner counts\nan in-coming breath and an out-going breath. Before counting the\nbreath, the practitioner breathes in through the nostrils and breathes\nout through the mouth a couple of times. Then one starts counting\nbreaths, but this time breathing in through the nostrils and breathing\nout through the nostrils. The breath count is performed while\nperforming an abdominal breathing: one brings in air all the way down\nto the lower abdomen, and breathes out from there. This exercise has\nthe effect of infusing one\u2019s mind-body with fresh life-energy\nand expelling a negative toxic energy out of the practitioner\u2019s\nsystem. For this reason, it must be done in a place where there is\nample ventilation. A key to performing breathing exercises\nsuccessfully is just to observe the in-coming and out-going\nbreath.\n\nThough these are simple instructions, they are difficult to execute\nbecause the neophyte tends to become distracted. Present concerns,\nworries, fears, and past memories often surface. Zen calls them\n\u201cwandering thoughts,\u201d which refers to any mental object\nthat prevents the practitioner from concentrating. If one wants to\nmake progress in meditation, this is one of the first things that the\npractitioner must learn to overcome.\n\nWe now turn to the psycho-physiological meaning of the breathing\nexercise. Ordinarily, we breathe sixteen to seventeen times per\nminute, which we do unconsciously or involuntarily. This is because\nunder ordinary circumstances, breathing is controlled by the autonomic\nnervous system. Neurophysiologically, the center where breathing is\ncontrolled is found in the hypothalamus, in the mid-brain. The\nautonomic nervous system is so-called because it functions\nindependently of our will. Zen breathing is a shift from unconscious,\ninvoluntary breathing to conscious, voluntary breathing. This means\nthat Zen meditation is a way of regulating the unconscious-autonomic\norder of our being. Psychologically, counting the breath trains the\nunconscious mind and neurophysiologically, it trains the involuntary\nactivity of the nerves that control the function of the various\nvisceral organs. Here we find a reason why Zen recommends abdominal\nbreathing. Nerves are bundled in the upper part of the abdominal\ncavity, and the abdominal breathing exercise stimulates this\nbundle. As it does so, parasympathetic nerves still the mind.\n\nThis point is significant in learning to control emotion. Ordinarily,\nwe are told to control our emotion by exercising our will. This is,\nfor example, what Kant recommends. This method works to a certain\nextent, but we expend our energy unnecessarily in exercising our\nwill. Think of a situation where one tries to submerge a ball in\nwater. When the size of the ball is relatively small, this can be\naccomplished with little effort. But as the size of the ball becomes\nlarger, it becomes increasingly difficult. Analogously, a lot\nof psychic energy is required to suppress one\u2019s deeper\nemotions. There comes a time then when one can no longer hold them\ndown. Consequently, one may end up exploding in various ways, ranging\nfrom personal fits to violent social crimes. If we observe a person in\nan angry state, we will notice that such a person\u2019s breathing\npattern and rhythm is shallow, rough, and irregular.\n\nOn the other hand, if we observe a person in a peaceful state, the breathing is\ndeep, smooth, slow, and rhythmical. These examples show that there is a\nstrong correlation between the pattern and the rhythm of breathing and\na person\u2019s emotional state, or more generally, state of mind.\nZen breathing has a way of naturally heightening the positive\ncorrelation between the activity of the autonomic nervous system and\nemotion. Neurophysiologically, it happens that the center\nwhere breathing is regulated and the region where emotion is generated\ncoincide. This means that the conscious breathing\npsychologically affects the pattern of how one generates emotion, and\nat the same time it also has a neurophysiological effect on how the\nautonomous activity of the unconscious is regulated. We will now move\non to the third step involved in meditation.\n",
