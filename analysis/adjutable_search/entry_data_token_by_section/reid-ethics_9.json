    "main_text": "The Moral Sense || Reid\u2019s defense of the reliability of the moral sense\n4.2 Reid\u2019s defense of the reliability of the moral sense\n\nIn Essays on the Active Powers, Reid extends this line of\nargument to the moral sense. The fact that we have no well-worked out\ntheory of how we form moral judgments does not itself rationally\nundercut the epistemic status of these judgments (see EAP V.ii:\n282\u201383). More importantly, the moral sense, Reid argues, is also\nindigenous. All normal human beings raised in a normal environment\nhave it. Moreover, its outputs include judgments of various\nsorts\u2014judgments about what is wrong, right, approbation-worthy,\nand so forth. The practice of forming moral judgments is, furthermore,\nsocially well-established over time. In fact, it is so deeply\nentrenched that it is, for all practical purposes, inescapable; try as\nwe might, we cannot avoid forming moral judgments. We also have\nsophisticated methods of evaluating moral judgments, such as appeals\nto what we today would call reflective equilibrium (see EAP\nIII.iii.vi). Finally, many moral judgments\u2014in particular, those\nthat concern the first principles\u2014are not subject to systemic\ndisagreement among competent participants. By and large, in\nReid\u2019s view, our judgments about these principles converge (see\nEAP III.iii.vi; for discussion, see Cuneo 2011b, 2011c and Levy 1999.\nDavis 2006 and 2010 explore Reid\u2019s treatment of moral\ndisagreement).\n\nGiven all this, Reid contends that we should reject moral skepticism.\nAt the outset of inquiry, the deliverances of the moral faculty, like\nthe deliverances of our other indigenous cognitive faculties, deserve\nan innocent until proven guilty status. Unlike Ross after him, Reid\nseems to think that our beliefs about not only moral first principles\nbut also particular cases can count as instances of knowledge.\n\nTo this point, we have seen important respects in which Reid\u2019s\naccount of the moral sense both articulates with and deviates from\nHutcheson\u2019s. On the one hand, Reid is, like Hutcheson, concerned\nto distance his view from the rationalists, who come very close to\ncharacterizing moral knowledge as a species of ordinary theoretical\nknowledge such as that achieved in mathematics. On the other, Reid\nalso wants to correct certain deficiencies in the sentimentalist\nprogram, such as the tendency to drive a sharp wedge between reason\nand \u201csense\u201d and to think of the deliverances of the moral\nsense as mere feelings. This allows Reid to defend the claim that the\nmoral sense is reliable in a perfectly straightforward sense.\n\nStill, while Reid wishes to emphasize that the moral sense issues in\nbona fide moral judgments, he also emphasizes that it issues in more\nthan mere moral judgments. Reid writes: \u201cOur moral judgments are\nnot, like those we form in speculative matters, dry and unaffecting,\nbut from their nature, are necessarily accompanied with affections and\nfeelings \u2026\u201d (EAP III.iii.vii: 180). Reid calls the\ncomplex state that combines moral judgment, affection, and feeling\n\u201cmoral approbation.\u201d\n\nMoral approbation, then, comprises three elements: moral judgment,\naffection, and feeling. Reid is clear that the moral judgments in\nquestion are not general ones that concern the first principles of\nmorals, but particular judgments that concern whether someone has\nbehaved well or badly or exemplifies a virtue or vice. The affections\nthat accompany them are, in turn, dispositions \u201cto do good or\nhurt to others,\u201d which have a de re structure since\nthey have \u201cpersons, and not things\u201d [i.e., propositions]\nas their immediate object (EAP III.iii.iv: 107). Finally, Reid accepts\na minimalist account of the feelings that comprise moral approbation.\nFeelings such as pleasure and pain, in Reid\u2019s view, have no\nintentional object; they are not about anything. Rather, they are, as\nit were, adverbial modifiers of mental states and events: one esteems\nanother pleasurably or disapproves of another painfully. By\ndistinguishing approbation from feeling, Reid clearly rejects the\nposition according to which (what we today would call) desires are to\nbe identified with feelings of one or another sort.\n\nIt is not difficult to discern the theoretical work that this account\nof moral approbation is supposed to do for Reid. Under a natural\nreading, in both the Treatise and the second\nEnquiry, Hume charged rational intuitionists with having no\naccount of why moral judgments, which are the output of reason, should\nhave such an intimate connection with motivation. Reid\u2019s answer\nto this challenge is to \u201cgo nativist\u201d: We are so\nconstituted that when we judge that, say, an action is unjust, we are\nmoved to action. That the moral sense should yield both judgments and\nmotivational states is built into its functional profile or design\nplan. By emphasizing that this is how things go in the moral realm,\nReid takes himself to employ a strategy he has used elsewhere in his\nelaboration of our perception of the external world.\n\nRecall in this regard Reid\u2019s account of tactile perception. In\nthe case of tactile perception, Reid says that given certain\nexperiential inputs, such as the pressure sensations evoked upon\ntouching a table, we form judgments about the hardness of the table.\nThe pressure sensations function as signs of the table\u2019s\nhardness, which immediately evoke the judgment in question. According\nto this account, there are no mental images or \u201cideas\u201d\nfrom which we infer the hardness of the table. Likewise, in the moral\ncase, we are presented with various kinds of experiential inputs such\nas the behavior and countenance of agents. These experiential inputs\nfunction as signs, immediately evoking in us moral judgments of\nvarious sorts. When all goes well, these judgments, in turn, yield\naffection and feelings of various sorts. Once again, there are no\nideas from which we infer moral judgments and the process of judgment\nformation is itself noninferential. By emphasizing the similarities\nbetween these two cases, we have seen that Reid takes himself to\ndefend an account of moral perception. It is an account, in\nReid\u2019s view, which blends together the most promising features\nof both the rationalist and sentimentalist traditions (see Cuneo\n2007a, forthcoming b). For it implies both that moral judgments\nexpress genuine moral propositional content and that these judgments\nbear an intimate connection with moral motivation.\n",
