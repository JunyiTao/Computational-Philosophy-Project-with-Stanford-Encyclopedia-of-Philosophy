    "main_text": "Self-Consciousness in Experience || The Sense of Ownership\n3.3 The Sense of Ownership\n\nPre-reflective, or implicit, accounts of the place of\nself-consciousness in experience are often associated with the\nso-called \u201csense of ownership\u201d, or \u201csense of\nmineness\u201d (Flanagan 1992; Martin 1995; Dokic 2003; Marcel 2003;\nZahavi 2005: ch. 5; de Vignemont 2007, 2013; Tsakiris 2011; Zahavi\n& Kriegel 2015). According to some, a fundamental aspect of\nconscious experiences is that they seem, in each case, to be\nmine. In being aware of a thought, action, emotion,\nperceptual experience, memory, bodily experience (and also my body\nitself), I am aware of it as being my own. This sense of\nownership arguably does some work in explaining why it seems difficult\nto conceive of what it would be like to experience a thought as\nlocated in another\u2019s mind, or a pain as located in\nanother\u2019s body (Martin 1995; Dokic 2003). For such an experience\nwould involve being aware of a thought that seemed to be mine but as\nlocated in a mind that did not seem to be my own. The sense of\nownership is also a candidate for explaining immunity to error through\nmisidentification since if conscious experiences seem to be\none\u2019s own, then there is presumably no need for any\nidentification of the experience\u2019s subject as oneself.\n\nWhilst the sense of ownership would, presumably, be accounted for by\nan introspective awareness of the self, it can also arguably be\nexplained with the more minimal commitments of the implicit view. The\nsense of an experience as my own can be understood as nothing over and\nabove the fact that the self is implicitly given in the mode of\nconscious awareness (Musholt 2015: \u00a74.2). Thus the focus on the\nsense of ownership might be thought to provide a minimal answer to\nHumean scepticism about self-perception. As Chisholm points out, for\nexample, although Hume complained that he could find no self in\nintrospection, he reported his findings in first-personal terms. That\nis, he was aware not only of his mental states, but also aware of them\nas his own (Chisholm 1976: ch. 1; cf. P.F. Strawson\u2019s\n1959: ch. 3, attack on the \u201cno-ownership\u201d view).\n\nEven within the context of an implicit account of self-consciousness\nin experience, we can further distinguish between reductive and\nnon-reductive construals of the sense of ownership (Berm\u00fadez\n2011; Zahavi & Kriegel 2015; Alsmith 2015). For example, Zahavi\nand Kriegel (2015; cf. Kriegel 2003, 2009; Zahavi 2014) defend a\nnon-reductive understanding of the sense of ownership as a distinct\naspect of the phenomenal character of experience. By contrast, a\nreductive account will explain the sense of ownership in terms of\ncognitive and/or experiential states whose existence we are\nindependently willing to endorse. For example, Berm\u00fadez (2011:\n161\u2013166) argues in favour of a reductive account of the sense of\nownership over one\u2019s own body, according to which it consists in\nnothing more than the phenomenology of the spatial location of bodily\nsensations alongside our disposition to judge the body in which they\noccur to be our own (cf. Dainton 2008: \u00a78.2; Prinz 2012).\nBerm\u00fadez\u2019s argument for the reductive view is, in part,\nbased on the claim that, despite appearances, the non-reductive sense\nof ownership is not in fact able to explain first-personal judgements\nof ownership (cf. Schear 2009; for a response see Zahavi & Kriegel\n2015).\n\nIt is sometimes claimed that the variety of ways in which\nself-consciousness can break down poses a challenge to the claim that\nthe sense of ownership is a universal characteristic of experience\n(e.g., Metzinger 2003: \u00a77.2.2). Thought insertion, anarchic hand,\nalien limb, anonymous memory, and anonymous vision, all seemingly\ninvolve subjects who are aware of their own conscious states, actions,\nor body parts, but without being aware of them as their own (for\nreferences, see the supplement:\n The Scope of Immunity to Error Through Misidentification).\n They may disown them or attribute them to others. For example, in\ncases of thought insertion, a symptom of schizophrenia, subjects\nreport that they are aware of the thoughts of other people or objects\nentering their own minds (see, for example, Saks 2007: ch. 2; for\ngeneral discussion of schizophrenia and self-consciousness see Parnas\n& Sass 2011). On the assumption that such subjects are actually\naware of what are, in fact, their own thoughts, this might seem to be\na case of a conscious experience that lacks the sense of ownership.\nThus, either the sense of ownership is not a necessary feature of\nexperience, or perhaps there is no sense of ownership at all (see, for\nexample, Chadha 2017).\n\nA common response to this line of thought involves, first,\ndistinguishing between the sense of ownership and the sense of agency\nand, second, claiming that subjects of thought insertion lack the\nlatter whilst retaining the former (Stephens & Graham 2000;\nGallagher 2004; Peacocke 2008: \u00a77.8; Proust 2013: ch. 12). The\nsense of agency is the awareness of being the source or the agent of\nsome action or activity, including mental agency. It is the sense that\nit is me that is thinking a given thought (Bayne 2008;\nO\u2019Brien & Soteriou 2009; Proust 2013: ch. 10). According to\nthis standard view, cases of thought insertion or anarchic hand, for\nexample, can be wholly explained by postulating a lack of a sense of\nagency. The usual sense of being the agent of a thought is lacking,\nbut the sense of ownership remains since the thought seems to the\nsubject be taking place in their own mind.\n\nWe might, however, wish to make a three-way distinction between the\nsense of agency (the sense that one is the author of a mental\nstate), the sense of ownership (the sense that one is the\nowner of a mental state), and what we might call the sense of\nlocation (the sense that a mental state is located within\none\u2019s own mind). The sense of location might be understood as\nbeing possessed if one is aware of a mental state in the ordinary way,\ni.e., introspectively. Crucial, it would seem, for evaluating the\nsignificance of thought insertion and related cases, and so of the\nstandard view, will be determining which, if any, of the senses of\nagency, ownership, or location remain intact. For it might be argued\nthat what such subjects retain is in fact the sense of location,\nrather than the sense of ownership. That is, it may be possible to\ntake their descriptions at face value when they deny, in thought\ninsertion for example, that the thoughts in question are their own (or\nwere thought by them), whilst nevertheless accepting that the inserted\nthought occurs within the boundary of their own mind (for criticisms\nof the standard view, see Bortolotti & Broome 2009; Pacherie &\nMartin 2013; Fern\u00e1ndez 2013: ch. 5; Billon 2013).\n",
