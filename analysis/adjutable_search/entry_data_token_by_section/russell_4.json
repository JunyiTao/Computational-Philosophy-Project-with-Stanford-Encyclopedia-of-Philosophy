Russell\u2019s Theory of Neutral Monism\n\nYet another of Russell\u2019s contributions is his defence of\n neutral monism,\n the view that the world consists of just one type of substance which\nis neither exclusively mental nor exclusively physical. Like idealism\n(the view that nothing exists but the mental) and physicalism (the\nview that nothing exists but the physical), neutral monism rejects\ndualism (the view that there exist distinct mental and physical\nsubstances). However, unlike both idealism and physicalism, neutral\nmonism holds that this single existing substance may be viewed in some\ncontexts as being mental and in others as being physical. As Russell\nputs it, \n\n\u201cNeutral monism\u201d \u2013 as opposed to idealistic monism\nand materialistic monism \u2013 is the theory that the things\ncommonly regarded as mental and the things commonly regarded as\nphysical do not differ in respect of any intrinsic property possessed\nby the one set and not by the other, but differ only in respect of\narrangement and context. (CP, Vol. 7, 15)\n\n\nTo help understand this general suggestion, Russell introduces his\nanalogy of a postal directory:\n\nThe theory may be illustrated by comparison with a postal directory,\nin which the same names come twice over, once in alphabetical and once\nin geographical order; we may compare the alphabetical order to the\nmental, and the geographical order to the physical. The affinities of\na given thing are quite different in the two orders, and its causes\nand effects obey different laws. Two objects may be connected in the\nmental world by the association of ideas, and in the physical world by\nthe law of gravitation. \u2026 Just as every man in the directory\nhas two kinds of neighbours, namely alphabetical neighbours and\ngeographical neighbours, so every object will lie at the intersection\nof two causal series with different laws, namely the mental series and\nthe physical series. \u2018Thoughts\u2019 are not different in\nsubstance from \u2018things\u2019; the stream of my thoughts is a\nstream of things, namely of the things which I should commonly be said\nto be thinking of; what leads to its being called a stream of thoughts\nis merely that the laws of succession are different from the physical\nlaws. (CP, Vol. 7, 15)\n\n\nIn other words, when viewed as being mental, a thought or idea may\nhave associated with it other thoughts or ideas that seem related even\nthough, when viewed as being physical, they have very little in\ncommon. As Russell explains, \u201cIn my mind, Caesar may call up\nCharlemagne, whereas in the physical world the two were widely\nsundered\u201d (CP, Vol. 7, 15). Even so, it is a mistake, on this\nview, to postulate two distinct types of thing (the idea of Caesar and\nthe man Caesar) that are composed of two distinct substances (the\nmental and the physical). Instead, \u201cThe whole duality of mind\nand matter, according to this theory, is a mistake; there is only one\nkind of stuff out of which the world is made, and this stuff is called\nmental in one arrangement, physical in the other\u201d (CP, Vol. 7,\n15).\n\nRussell appears to have developed this theory around 1913, while\nworking on his Theory of Knowledge manuscript and on his 1914\nMonist article, \u201cOn the Nature of Acquaintance.\u201d\nDecades later, in 1964, he remarked that \u201cI am not conscious of\nany serious change in my philosophy since I adopted neutral\nmonism\u201d (Eames 1967, 511). Even so, over the next several\ndecades Russell continued to do a large amount of original work,\nauthoring such important books as The Analysis of Mind\n(1921), The Analysis of Matter (1927a), An Inquiry into\nMeaning and Truth (1940) and Human Knowledge: Its Scope and\nLimits (1948).\n\nToday several authors, including David Chalmers (1996, 155), Thomas\nNagel (2002, 209) and Erik Banks (2014, 114), have shown renewed\ninterest in considering Russell\u2019s general approach to the mind.\n\n\nIn addition to the above titles by Russell, Russell\u2019s most\ninfluential writings relating to his theories of metaphysics and\nepistemology include Our Knowledge of the External World\n(1914a), \u201cThe Relation of Sense-Data to Physics\u201d (1914c),\n\u201cThe Philosophy of Logical Atomism\u201d (1918, 1919),\n\u201cOn Propositions: What They Are and How They Mean\u201d (1919b)\nand An Outline of Philosophy (1927b).\n",
