    "main_text": "Introduction || A Note on Policy\n1.3 A Note on Policy\n\nPolicy is only one of the concerns of this article. There is\nsignificant public discussion about AI ethics, and there are frequent\npronouncements from politicians that the matter requires new policy,\nwhich is easier said than done: Actual technology policy is difficult\nto plan and enforce. It can take many forms, from incentives and\nfunding, infrastructure, taxation, or good-will statements, to\nregulation by various actors, and the law. Policy for AI will possibly\ncome into conflict with other aims of technology policy or general\npolicy. Governments, parliaments, associations, and industry circles\nin industrialised countries have produced reports and white papers in\nrecent years, and some have generated good-will slogans\n(\u201ctrusted/responsible/humane/human-centred/good/beneficial\nAI\u201d), but is that what is needed? For a survey, see Jobin,\nIenca, and Vayena (2019) and V. M\u00fcller\u2019s list of\n PT-AI Policy Documents and Institutions.\n\nFor people who work in ethics and policy, there might be a tendency to\noverestimate the impact and threats from a new technology, and to\nunderestimate how far current regulation can reach (e.g., for product\nliability). On the other hand, there is a tendency for businesses, the\nmilitary, and some public administrations to \u201cjust talk\u201d\nand do some \u201cethics washing\u201d in order to preserve a good\npublic image and continue as before. Actually implementing legally\nbinding regulation would challenge existing business models and\npractices. Actual policy is not just an implementation of ethical\ntheory, but subject to societal power structures\u2014and the agents\nthat do have the power will push against anything that restricts them.\nThere is thus a significant risk that regulation will remain toothless\nin the face of economical and political power.\n\nThough very little actual policy has been produced, there are some\nnotable beginnings: The latest EU policy document suggests\n\u201ctrustworthy AI\u201d should be lawful, ethical, and\ntechnically robust, and then spells this out as seven requirements:\nhuman oversight, technical robustness, privacy and data governance,\ntransparency, fairness, well-being, and accountability (AI HLEG 2019\n[OIR]). Much European research now runs under the slogan of\n\u201cresponsible research and innovation\u201d (RRI), and\n\u201ctechnology assessment\u201d has been a standard field since\nthe advent of nuclear power. Professional ethics is also a standard\nfield in information technology, and this includes issues that are\nrelevant in this article. Perhaps a \u201ccode of ethics\u201d for\nAI engineers, analogous to the codes of ethics for medical doctors, is\nan option here (V\u00e9liz 2019). What data science itself should do\nis addressed in (L. Taylor and Purtova 2019). We also expect that much\npolicy will eventually cover specific uses or technologies of AI and\nrobotics, rather than the field as a whole. A useful summary of an\nethical framework for AI is given in (European Group on Ethics in\nScience and New Technologies 2018: 13ff). On general AI policy, see\nCalo (2018) as well as Crawford and Calo (2016); Stahl, Timmermans,\nand Mittelstadt (2016); Johnson and Verdicchio (2017); and Giubilini\nand Savulescu (2018). A more political angle of technology is often\ndiscussed in the field of \u201cScience and Technology Studies\u201d\n(STS). As books like The Ethics of Invention (Jasanoff 2016)\nshow, concerns in STS are often quite similar to those in ethics\n(Jacobs et al. 2019 [OIR]). In this article, we discuss the policy for\neach type of issue separately rather than for AI or robotics in\ngeneral.\n",
