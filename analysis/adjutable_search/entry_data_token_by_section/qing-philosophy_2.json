    "main_text": "Historicism: Contingency and Constancy\n3. Historicism: Contingency and Constancy\n\nNeo-Confucian thought in the Song-Ming times bore a strong dimension\nof ontological ultimacy, such that its criteria of intelligibility may\nbe considered as essentially metaphysical in nature. As the vitalist\nsensibility began to take center stage in the late Ming and early\nQing, there was a shift from the ontological (the essential and\ntranscendent) to the ontic (the contingent and experiential), and the\nlatter came to be expressed as a historicism\u2014a prevailing\nworldview that appreciated changing particulars rather than a\nfoundational metaphysics of eternal universals. Thus, the term\n\u201chistoricism\u201d, as it is used in the context of Qing\nphilosophy, is interchangeable with descriptions such as \u201cthe\nsense of history\u201d, \u201cthe historical\u201d and\n\u201chistorical-mindedness\u201d. Indeed, a permeating sense of\nhistory seemed to have formed a common thread that ran through the\nlearning of the intellectual stalwarts who personified the Ming-Qing\nintellectual transition, such as the aforementioned Wang Fuzhi, Gu\nYanwu, and Huang Zongxi. They pursued their subject-matters, such as\nthe classics, institutions, statecraft, and phonology, by coming to\ngrips with their patterns of development and growth, taking into\naccount their diversity and particularity. They were inclined to\neschew totalizing metaphysical views that conferred on things and\naffairs an underpinning unity. Instead, they embraced a historicist\nperspective that shunned supra-historical principles and transcendent\nnorms, subjecting the investigation of phenomena to a logic of\nbecoming, not being. Lest we exaggerate the extent and influence of\nthis time-bound and relativist historicist perspective, a note of\nreservation and qualification is needed. While the Qing philosophical\nmode of intellection no doubt diverged from the ahistoricist\nNeo-Confucianism that saw history as a function of some ultimate truth\nsuch as li, tian, ordao, it was not\nentirely freed from the belief in some transhistorical and universal\nreality. The historicism in Qing philosophy was fraught with tension,\nto the extent that the appreciation for the particularity was tempered\nby a transhistorical sense of abiding universal order. \n\nOur ideal-typical historicism found expression in Huang Zongxi\u2019s\nand Wang Fuzhi\u2019s efforts to reformulate the Neo-Confucian\nontology. Huang\u2019s historicist sensibility can be seen in the\nvery first lines of his masterpiece, the Mingru xue\u2019an\n(Intellectual Records of Ming Scholars), in which he lay out a\nmetaphysical predicate: \n\n\nThroughout heaven and earth is the mind-heart (xin), whose\nchanges are unpredictable. It is inexorably manifested in myriad\ndifferent forms. The mind-heart has no fundamental substance.\nFundamental substance is that which is achieved by its efficacious\neffort. Therefore, to plumb the principle (li) is to probe\nthe myriad different forms of this mind-heart, not the myriad\ndifferent forms of the myriad things. (Huang MRXA: preface 9) \n\n\nWhile Huang asserted the mind-heart as the point of departure, he\nmoved away from the orientations of the so-called learning of the\nmind-heart (xinxue) in Neo-Confucianism. Instead of focusing\non \u201cfundamental substance\u201d, Huang emphasized\n\u201cefforts\u201d. Rather than moving inward toward the\nmind-heart, Huang\u2019s position drifted outward into the outer\nphysical phenomenal world, in which there were the ever-changing\n\u201cmyriad different forms\u201d, differences perceived through\nthe one mind notwithstanding. In other words, although there was the\noverarching universal mind-heart, this mind-heart was no incorporeal\noriginal substance hovering above the concrete variegated world of\nparticularities and efforts. There was no immutable fundamental\nsubstance as such, as the mind-heart was developmental in nature,\nmanifested in the external myriad differences.\n\nHuang also had a dynamic view of institutional evolution. Upon\nexamining the historical origins and evolutions of the various\nspecific institutions, he concluded that imitation of the institutions\ndescribed in the ancient classics was impractical, stating that\n\u201cunder heaven\u2026 there have not been laws and institutions\nthat could not be overthrown\u201d (quoted in Gu Qingmei 1978: 146).\nHuang saw his own time as one bound to a long historical series, as\none segment contiguous with the preceding and succeeding epoch. There\nwere the ancient Three Dynasties with their magnificent order,\nfollowed by two thousand years of disorder after the death of\nConfucius. Now, the time for change had again come. \n\nWang Fuzhi reordered the Neo-Confucian ontology through his\nhistorico-philosophical theory of shi (conditions)\nvis-\u00e0-vis li (principle). Wang accorded principle\npriority as the immanent pattern of all things and affairs, that is,\nas that which is \u201cthe certain\u201d (guran),\n\u201cthe necessary\u201d (biran), \u201cthe\nself-evident\u201d (dangran), \u201cthe why and\nwherefore\u201d (suoyiran) and \u201cthe natural\u201d\n(ziran). But principle was embedded in concrete\npsycho-physical force (qi) and manifested in actual\nconditions: \n\n\nTherefore, originally, there is principle which can be readily seen in\nmaterial force. Accordingly, this obtained principle naturally becomes\nconditions. Thus principle can be seen in these necessary conditions.\n(Wang QSYS: 48:9.5a) \n\n\nPrinciple and conditions should always \u201cbe discussed\nsyncretically as a whole\u201d (Wang QSYS: 48:9.5a-b). This\nrelational integrity presumed that the primacy of principle was\npredicated on the immediacy of differentiation: \u201cConditions\nbecome different when times are different; principle also becomes\ndifferent when conditions are different\u201d (Wang QSYS: 58:15.3b).\nLi-qi as a totality represented the universe as complex\nphenomena of perpetually appearing contingencies, subject to the\nworkings of human agency: \u201cWhen one accords with the times, one\ncomplies with that which the time makes inevitable in order to save\noneself, and so escape from disaster\u201d (quoted in McMorran 1975:\n457).\n\nAs with Huang Zongxi, Wang Fu-chih saw the development of institutions\nthrough a historicist perspective. The institutions of each age were\ncompositely the shi, or conditions sui generis. They\nwere the Way of that age, which human beings with volitions and\ntransformative leverage followed. Every age had its own appropriate\ninstitutions: \n\n\nThe rule of every epoch should be in accordance with its own time,\nestablishing [the particular] institutions of an epoch\u2026. Never\nhas there been the successful establishment of governance as a result\nof imitating the one merit of just the one thing of the ancients, or\nchampioning one ancient thing, obtrusively injected into the present.\n(Wang QSYS: 21:5b-6a) \n\n\nEven the Classics prescribed no unchanging models: \n\n\nAs to setting up schemes or arranging for details, neither the\nBook of History nor Confucius said anything about\nthem\u2026. Because the ancient institutions were meant to govern\nthe ancient world and cannot be followed today, the superior man does\nnot base his activities on them, and because what is suitable today\ncan govern the world of today but will not necessarily for the future,\nthe superior man does not hand it down to posterity as a model.\n(quoted in Chan 1963: 701)\n\n\nGu Yanwu, unlike Huang and Wang, eschewed metaphysical pondering\naltogether. He advanced the view that dynamic historical change was\nthe rule of the day with regard to institutional development. The\nvalue of institutions was determined by the contexts of both their\norigins and their subsequent functional uses. He, for instance,\nhammered home this message in his proposal to reform the\nweisuo (guard and battalion) military system of the late Ming\ndynasty: \n\n\nWithout the change of institutions, current problems cannot be\nrectified. If in a circumstance where change is inevitable, one still\nconceals the actuality of [the need for] change and obstinately clings\nto the position of not changing, it will certainly lead to the gravest\nof calamities. (Gu GTLSWJ: 128) \n\n\nThere must be periodic reforms to forestall calamities: \n\n\nIf we understand that the feudal system changed into the prefectural\nsystem, we also understand that as the prefectural system in turn\nfalls into decay, it too must change. Does it mean that there will be\na return to feudalism? No, this is impossible. But if some sage who\ncould invest the prefectural system with the essential meaning of\nfeudalism were to appear, then the world would attain order\u2026.\nNow, the defects of the prefectural [system] have developed to their\nutmost\u2026. But still, it was followed in all its details. That is\nwhy the livelihood of people is diminishing daily; that is why China\nis growing weaker daily. (GTLSWJ: 12)\n\n\nBut it is noteworthy that while Huang, Wang, and Gu argued for\nexpedient change relative to the time and its particular conditions,\nthey all subscribed to the universal values ensconced in the ancient\nClassics. Huang embraced the enduring principles bequeathed by the\nancient Three Dynasties. In his famous Mingyi daifang lu (A\nPlan for the Prince), he affirmed the constancy of the ancient\nprinciple of governance which was, in brief, unswerving devotion to\npromoting the interests and benefits of the people: \n\n\nWhen the sagely rulers appeared, they did not treat their own profits\nas profits, but would seek to benefit the world. [They did] not regard\nharm to themselves as the only harm, but would seek to release the\nworld from harm. They had to work thousands of times harder than other\npeople in the world. (Huang MYDFL: 2) \n\n\nWang Fuzhi also posited timeless principle in the historical process\nof governance. He balanced the particularities of the dynasties\nagainst the constant principles of the Classics: \n\n\nFor the best way of government, there is nothing better than to\nexamine the Classic of Documents and modify it with the words\nof Confucius. But the central point is whether the ruler\u2019s heart\nis serious or dissolute\u2026. The great function of government is\nto make use of worthy men and promote education. In dealing with\npeople, it should bestow humanity and love to the highest degree.\nWhether in the government of Yao and Shun, in the Three Dynasties, or\n[in the period] from the Qin and Han down to the present, in no case\ncan these principles not be extended and applied. (quoted in Chan\n1963: 701) \n\n\nWang saw excellence in the ancient sage-rulers\u2019 achievements and\nthus regarded historical changes as divergence from the Golden Past.\nGu Yanwu also enjoined rulers to uphold the Confucian \u201cfour\nbonds\u201d (siwei) as the overarching principles that\nguided history: \n\n\nPropriety (li) and righteousness (i) are the supreme\nways in ruling people. Integrity (lian) and the sense of\nshame (chi) are the great principles in cultivating humanity.\nWithout integrity, there is nothing that is not coveted; without the\nsense of shame, there is no [wicked] deed that is not committed. If\npeople are like that, catastrophe, failure, disorder, and death will\ncome. (Gu RZL: 5:53) \n\n\nIn his Records of Daily Knowledge (Rizhi lu), Gu\nsurveyed the entire course of Chinese history, from the Zhou to his\nown time, and concluded that only when ethics and morals were\nchampioned that peace and prosperity could be attained.\n\nThus, Huang, Wang, and Gu\u2019s admiration of the ancient past\nimbued their historicism with a sense of ultimacy achieved once upon a\ntime. While they might not be seeking literal return to the past, they\nbetrayed their yearning for the constant and the transhistorical.\nTheir goal of encrusting measures apposite to current needs with\nancient principles suggested that there was more to history than the\ncontingencies and expediencies of any one time.\n\nThe mid-Qing witnessed the predominance of the intellectualist pursuit\nof evidential research (kaozheng), with particular regard to\nthe exegetical and philological investigations of the classics, driven\nby the fundamentalist goal to retrieve the antique Way enshrined in\nthe classical texts. Nevertheless, when the classics and antiquity\nwere subjected to meticulous scrutiny and rigorous examination, the\nancient past came to be interrogated and problematized. Which were the\nauthentic classics? Which part of antiquity was to be restored? How\nshould we go about apprehending the past? Therefore, what began as a\nclassicization of antiquity aimed at cutting through the Neo-Confucian\nmetaphysical babel ended as a partial historicization of the classics.\nThe ancient past and the classics became objects in time to\nbe studied, thereby given their historicity. The works and thoughts of\nDai Zhen (1724\u201377) and Zhang Xuecheng (1738\u20131801)\nexemplified the historicist temper of the time.\n\nDai Zhen, as we have seen, contended that everything had its\nprinciple, which varied in accordance with the thing itself.\nUniversality was broken into particularities, such that principle\n(li) was the \u201cinner texture of things\u201d\n(tiaoli), the organizational pattern and textural\nconfiguration of the psycho-physical force (qi), manifested\nas \u201cliving, drinking, eating, talking and acting\u201d (Dai\nMZZYSZ: 110\u2013113). Dai questioned the notion of an essential\nprinciple invariant through time through his idea of \u201cexpedient\nweighing of circumstances\u201d (quan), associated with the\nidea of change (bian): \n\n\nWith quan, the insignificant and important can be\ndistinguished\u2026. Constancy refers to the obvious insignificant\nand important [things], observed by all throughout time. As for the\nimportant becoming insignificant, or insignificant becoming important,\nit is change (bian). Change cannot be fully known without the\ncorrect measure resulting from intelligent exhaustive observations and\ninvestigations. (MZZYSZ: 125) \n\n\nConsequently, right and wrong (shifei) should be gauged in\nrelationship to expediency: \n\n\nObstinately adhering to the apparently important and insignificant as\nseen by all, [many people] affirm what is right, and criticize what is\nwrong. In fact, [they] do not realize that timely expediency renders\nthe important into the insignificant, the insignificant important.\n(MZZYSZ: 128) \n\n\nIn his masterly essay, \u201cProbing the Original Goodness\u201d\n(Yuanshan), Dai identified expediency as one of the\ncharacteristics of the pervading common virtue of\n\u201cgoodness\u201d (shan): \u201cBecause of its\ncoherence with changes, it is called the norm of expediency\u201d\n(Chung-ying Cheng 1971: 68). This appreciation for change was\ntransposed epistemologically into Dai\u2019s preoccupation with\nmeticulous examination of the origins and developments of multifarious\nthings in history: ancient pronunciations of characters, attire and\ncostumes, changes in place names, implements of the artisans,\nnomenclature and categories of fauna and flora, mathematics, musical\ninstruments, and the like. The principles and meanings of the sages,\nand indeed the Way itself, had to be found in the actual\n\u201cstatutes, laws, institutions and measures\u201d (Dai DZWJ:\n145), that is, things in the historical records.\n\nYet, there was no consistent historicism in Dai\u2019s philosophy.\nHis conception of change was ultimately constrained by his abiding\nsense of the ultimacy of \u201cthe necessary\u201d (biran):\n\n\n\nThe Odes says, \u201cWhere there is a thing, there is a\nrule\u201d. \u201cThing\u201d is the name for an actual body and an\nactual matter. \u201cRule\u201d is the name for its primary\nfundamental quintessence. All actual bodies and actual matters are\nnatural, which ultimately return to the necessary. (Dai MZZYSZ: 60)\n\n\n\nThe \u201cprimary fundamental quintessence\u201d and \u201cthe\nnecessary\u201d, in space and time respectively, denoted the totality\nof all beings. Individuality was simply a variation or expression of\nthe totalizing Way, or common goodness: \n\n\n[G]oodness is used to mean what is inherent in humanity [and\nthings.]\u2026 The so-called goodness is nothing other than the\nformation and transformation of heaven-and-earth and the function and\ncapacities of nature. (Chung-ying Cheng 1971: 33\u201334) \n\n\nIndividual nature was the result of the \u201callotment\u201d\n(fen) by the \u201cdao of heaven\u201d.\nOne\u2019s destiny, as mandated by the Way of heaven, accounted for\none\u2019s individual nature: \u201cThe limit set by\n[Heaven\u2019s] allotment is called destiny which, in producing a\nkind of constitution, is called nature\u201d (1971: 2) This\nfoundational perspective of inexorability became in Dai\u2019s\nclassical learning the confirmation of the universality of the\nsages\u2019 ancient values: \n\n\nIf we do not seek to understand the utterances and deeds of the\nancient sages, there is no way we can investigate their mind [which\npervades] the ensuing thousands of years. Therefore, it is through\n[the study of] the Classics, mathematics, institutions and categories\nof things that [the meaning of their] language can be comprehended,\nthereby meeting them with one mind. (Dai DZWJ: 177)\n\n\nDai Zhen\u2019s philosophy was inspired by faith in the eternality of\nthe ancient Way, concerned with effecting the return of a moral system\nalready established in antiquity. Yet, this return was enabled only by\nthe examination of the historical records, which yielded a keen\nawareness of differentness, particularity, individuality and\ncontingency\u2014a historicist sensibility. Dai juxtaposed the\nclassics (the Way/dao) and history\n(expediency/quan), such that historical pursuits were\ncomplementary with fundamentalist classical studies aimed at restoring\nancient truths.\n\nA testimonial of the synthesis of history and classics was Zhang\nXuecheng\u2019s famous statement in his Wenshi tongyi\n(General principles of literature and history): \u201cThe\nSix Classics are all histories\u201d. He further said, \u201cThe\nancients never did talk of principles separated from affairs. The Six\nClassics are the statutes and records of the government of the ancient\nrulers\u201d (Zhang WSTY: 2). These claims formed the foundation of\nZhang\u2019s view of history: history referred to the history of the\ninstitutions and laws of antiquity, and principles could only be\ndiscussed with reference to actual events\u2014history. If the\nclassics were time-bound, that is, within antiquity, then the\ndao resided therein was temporally circumscribed: \n\n\nThe meanings concealed in what had occurred once upon a time [in\nantiquity] can be adequately explained through glossing and\netymological study of the [classical] texts. As to the development of\nevents which occurred thereafter, the classics could not have anything\nto say. (WSTY: 42) \n\n\nThe classics recorded only the laws and institutions of the ancient\nrulers, the material realities of the ancient Way: \n\n\nThe learning of the Three Dynasties recognized only history and not\nthe classics. [It was because it] was intimately related to human\naffairs\u2026. [O]ne who talks about human nature and heaven\u2019s\nmandate must study history. (WSTY: 52) \n\n\nIn order to know the dao-in-history, one had to examine the\nentire course of history. Recent history revealed the recent Way, and\nancient history shed light on the ancient one. Consequently, Zhang\npromoted the study of current history and the development of an\nawareness of \u201cvaluing the institutions of the current\nruler\u201d. Learning involved investigations of the existing\ninstitutions closely connected to human relations and daily utility.\nNo matter how advanced scholarship on the ancient past was, without\nknowing the present, it would be \u201cinappropriate for practical\napplication\u201d (WSTY: 53).\n\nBut Zhang did not see the past simply as successive parades of\nrelative spatial forms and temporal segments. Instead of\nparticularizing the ancient past and the classics once and for all,\nZhang often sought in them the universally normative. The\ndao-in-history pertained to the pattern of change of the\npolitical, social and institutional polity, things such as\n\u201cgovernment, pedagogy, marking out boundaries, delimiting\nprefectures, well-field system, feudalism and education\u201d (WSTY:\n34). These were changing forms of life relative to their own place and\ntime, embodying their own Way. But overarching these particular Ways\nwas the transhistorical dao of the ancient sages, enshrined\nin the classics, which Zhang called the \u201cthe essential\nWay\u201d (daoti): \n\n\nThe essential Way leaves nothing unembodied. It is exhaustively\nexplicated in the Six Classics. The various other philosophers were\nable to write at all, maintaining their well-reasoned viewpoints and\nmaking logical sense, because [they] invariably had attained\n[understanding] of one aspect of the essential dao. (WSTY:\n16\u201317) \n\n\nThis transhistorical Way was thus the provenance of all learning and\nphilosophy. Elsewhere, Zhang regarded this Way as \u201cmoral-ritual\nteachings\u201d (mingjiao): \n\n\nWhat the ancient sage-rulers showed the world to enlighten the people\nwere nothing but [their] moral-ritual teachings. Since ancient times,\nnone have achieved peace without moral-ritual teachings. (WSTY: 95)\n\n\n\nMoral-ritual teachings were the very stuff and source of governance.\nWhen Zhang urged that post-antiquity history be examined independently\nof the Six Classics, he did not aim at demolishing the classics\u2019\nsacral authority. He only cautioned against any literal usage of them\nin historical endeavors, which could swamp all sense of change after\nthe Three Dynasties. Zhang enjoined us to \u201cvalue summing up the\nessence of the principles of the Six Classics and narrate events in\ntime in order to probe the great dao\u201d (WSTY: 42).\nHistory, in a sense, was the unfurling of this authoritative\n\u201cgreat Way\u201d (dadao), the meanings and messages of\nwhich were expounded in the classics: \n\n\nThe great meaning of the Six Classics is brilliant as the sun and\nmoon. [The lessons of] losses and gains in the Three Dynasties can be\nprojected [as guides for the subsequent] hundred ages. (WSTY: 50) \n\n\nThus, in the \u201cessential dao\u201d, the \u201cgreat\ndao\u201d or the essential and great \u201cmoral-ritual\nteachings\u201d, Zhang\u2019s historicism was dissolved.\n\nAs the cases of Dai Zhen and Zhang Xuecheng show, Qing thought\ninvolved the rethinking of the individual as a historical being who\nverified the validity of institutions and laws through the authority\nof history, resisting values and norms that were conceived as the\nformulaic good applied to all times and cases. Yet, it dislodged\nno telos of the ancient Way, as a mainspring of Qing\nphilosophy was surely the retrieval of the dao of the\nclassics. Historicism as a means of evaluating the past achieved no\nhegemony. What occurred was a critical hermeneutical exploration of\nthe ancient classics and writings. Within the boundaries of the\ninherited intellectual tradition, the classicist endeavors bred a\nhistoricist sensibility, problematizing the nature of the Way as the\nembodiment of truth-in/above-history. This historicism signified a\ndiscursive tension that placed a strain on an intellectual field, but\none nevertheless circumscribed by age-old Confucian values.\n",
