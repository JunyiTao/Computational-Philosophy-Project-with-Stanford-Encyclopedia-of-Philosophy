    "main_text": "The Move to Mid-Level Theorizing: a Principles-Centered Approach || Criticisms of the Principles-Centered Approach\n4.3 Criticisms of the Principles-Centered Approach\n\nThere is a pluralistic element to Beauchamp and Childress\u2019\napproach, which is manifested, in part, by the fact that the approach\navoids a single overarching principle in favor of the short list of\nfour moral principles. This has lead some to criticize Beauchamp and\nChildress\u2019 approach for an alleged lack of systematicity\u2014a\nfatal flaw, according to some, in any philosophical theory (Gert,\nCulver, & Clauser 2006). Such critics claim that without a clear\nprioritizing of principles, Beauchamp and Childress\u2019\nprinciples-centered approach lacks rigor and leaves too much room for\nintuitive judgments in cases where principles conflict. Beauchamp and\nChildress respond, first, by rejecting the very idea that they are\noffering a philosophical theory, rather than a framework or practical\nguide. But perhaps more importantly, they doubt that any priority\nranking of their principles would stand the test of time (Arras 2017:\n6\u20139).\n\nA fairly recent criticism comes from John McMillan, according to whom\nBeauchamp and Childress\u2019 approach stifles careful reflection\nabout real issues. McMillan claims that principle-centered methods\ncannot lead to the formulation of what he calls \u201creasoned\nconvictions about moral problems\u201d, and writes that the four\nprinciples approach hinders bringing moral reason to bear upon\npractical questions. This is because, as McMillan has it, newcomers to\nbioethics will subsume whatever issues are under consideration under\none of the four principles, and then rule that the principle of\nautonomy should trump the other three principles. While recognizing\nthat such a method is not what Beauchamp and Childress intended,\nMcMillan writes that it is in fact the way the four principles\napproach is typically employed (McMillan 2018: 51\u201353).\n\nTwo interesting criticisms of Beauchamp and Childress\u2019 latest\nmoves come from the late John Arras. Arras questions the plausibility\nof Beauchamp and Childress\u2019 hybrid account, specifically the\naccount\u2019s reliance upon the common morality as a foundation.\nArras asks why Beauchamp and Childress distinguish the norms of the\ncommon morality from (what John Rawls called) our considered moral\njudgments, which are themselves revisable. Arras recognizes that\nBeauchamp and Childress might motivate their appeal to a foundation on\nthe ground that coherence alone cannot secure moral truth. In that\ncase, though, Arras wonders how much additional justificatory\nadvantage is leveraged by appealing to the foundational common\nmorality, as reflective equilibrium itself is maximally inclusive of\nall pieces of the moral picture (including, presumably, the common\nmorality\u2019s norms). The problem, as Arras has it, is the\nconception of the common morality as being in its own moral sphere,\nremoved from reflective equilibrium\u2019s dialectic. Arras is\nskeptical that the common morality is in fact untouched by the\nvicissitudes of time and the dialectics of reflective equilibrium\n(Arras 2017: 24\u201326).\n\nA second criticism from Arras deals with Beauchamp and\nChildress\u2019 embrace of wide reflective equilibrium. According to\nArras, it is difficult to comprehend how moral principles can retain\ntheir priority in conceptual analysis in the face of this endorsement\nof wide reflective equilibrium (Arras 2017: 182\u20133). Arras asks\nus to recall that within wide reflective equilibrium, no single\ncluster of moral considerations (e.g., considered case judgments,\nbackground theories, moral principles) is privileged. What matters in\nreflective equilibrium\u2019s revising process, in fact, is our level\nof commitment to those considerations, rather than the form of the\ncommitments themselves (Scanlon 1992; DePaul 1993: 57). Thus, our\nbeliefs about principles, just like our beliefs in background theories\nand considered case judgments, are always subject to revision. The\nprinciples-centered approach seems to have sacrificed its\nmethodological distinctiveness, so Arras\u2019 criticism goes, given\nhow principles appear to have been robbed of their conceptual\npriority.\n\nFinally, Beauchamp and Childress themselves recently acknowledge two\nmisunderstandings of their four principles framework. The first\nmisunderstanding is that the framework represents American\nindividualism, with the principle of autonomy taking priority. Their\nresponse is, first, to contest any connection between American\nindividualism and a respect for autonomy. Further, they emphasize that\ntheir framework\u2019s principles are all only prima facie\nbinding. The second misunderstanding is that the framework downplays\nthe virtues. It has been argued that medical ethics should be\nunderwritten by virtue-based ethics rather than by principle-based\nethics, and that that approach has a better chance of restoring\nhumanity to health care (de Zulueta 2015). Here, Beauchamp and\nChildress point to various discussions of virtue theory and moral\ncharacter appearing in various editions of PBE, including a discussion\nin the eighth edition of how virtues and principles might work\ntogether in certain practical scenarios (Beauchamp & Childress\n2019b: 11).\n",
