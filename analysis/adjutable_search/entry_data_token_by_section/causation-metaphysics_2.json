    "main_text": "Type Causation || Relationship to Token Causation\n2.1 Relationship to Token Causation\n\nType causal relations are described by generic claims like\n\u201cDrowsy driving causes crashes\u201d or \u201cSmoking causes\ncancer\u201d. One prominent question concerns the relationship\nbetween type and token causal claims. One view has it that type causal\nclaims are just generalizations or generics about token causal claims\n(see Lewis 1973; Hausman 1998: chapter 5; and Hausman 2005). For\ninstance, to say that smoking causes cancer is just to say that token\ncancers are generally caused by token histories of smoking. And to say\nthat drowsy driving causes crashes is just to say that, in general,\ntoken episodes of drowsy driving cause token crashes. Generic claims\nlike these shouldn\u2019t be understood as saying that most\nor even many token episodes of drowsy driving are token\ncauses of car crashes. Compare: \u201cmosquitos carry the West Nile\nvirus\u201d, which is a true generic despite the fact that most\nmosquitos do not carry the West Nile virus. (See the entry on\n generics.)\n On this view, type causal claims are ultimately about token causal\nrelations.\n\nAnother view has it that type causal relations are more fundamental\nthan token causal relations; what makes it the case that\nChris\u2019s smoking caused his cancer is, at least in part,\nthat smoking causes cancer, Chris smoked, and he got cancer. This kind\nof view is defended by theorists like Hume (1739\u201340, 1748), Mill\n(1843), J. L. Mackie (1965), Hempel (1965), and Davidson (1967). These\ntheorists begin by giving an analysis of causal relations between\ntypes of events, facts, or what-have-you. For instance: Hume says that\nwhat it is for the type C to cause the type E is for\nthings of type C to be constantly conjoined with things of\ntype E. This general regularity is then used to explain why\nit is that any particular thing of type C is a token cause of\nany particular thing of type E. Subsequent regularity and\n\u201ccovering law\u201d theories add additional bells and whistles;\nbut they retain the idea that a token causal relation between\nc and e holds in virtue of some broader regularity\nor law which subsumes the particular relationship between c\nand e.\n\nOne reason to doubt that token causal relations are just\ninstantiations of type causal relations is that there appear to be\ntoken causal relations without any corresponding type causal relation,\nand there appear to be token causal relations which go against the\ncorresponding type causal relations. Scriven (1962) gives the\nfollowing example: you reach for your cigarettes, accidentally\nknocking over an ink bottle and staining the carpet. Your reaching for\nyour cigarettes caused the carpet to be stained, but it\u2019s not\nthe case that reaching for cigarettes causes carpet stains in general.\nSuppes (1970) attributes this example to Deborah Rosen: at the golf\ncourse, you hit the ball into a tree, the ball rebounds and,\nfantastically enough, goes into the hole. In this case, hitting the\nball into the tree caused the hole-in-one, but hitting the ball into\ntrees does not cause holes-in-one in general.\n\nA third position, defended by Ellery Eells (1991), is that neither\ntoken nor type causal relations are more fundamental than the other.\nEells gives two probabilistic analyses of causation: one for type\ncausation, and another for token causation. Eells thinks that type\ncausal claims cannot just be generalizations about token causal claims\nbecause of examples like this: drinking a quart of plutonium causes\ndeath, even though nobody has ever drank a quart of plutonium, and so\nno particular persons\u2019s death has been caused by drinking a\nquart of plutonium. So this type causal claim cannot be a\ngeneralization over token causal claims. (See Hausman 1998: chapter 5,\nfor a response.)\n\nFor more on the relationship between token and type causation,\nparticularly within a probabilistic approach to causation, see\nHitchcock (1995a).\n",
