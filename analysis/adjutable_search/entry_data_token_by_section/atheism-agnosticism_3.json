An Argument for Agnosticism\n\nAccording to one relatively modest form of agnosticism, neither\nversatile theism nor its denial, global atheism, is known to be true.\nRobin Le Poidevin (2010: 76) argues for this position as follows:\n\n\n(1)There is\nno firm basis upon which to judge that theism or atheism is\nintrinsically more probable than the other. \n\n\n(2)There is\nno firm basis upon which to judge that the total evidence favors\ntheism or atheism over the other. \n It follows from (1) and (2) that\n\n\n(3)There is\nno firm basis upon which to judge that theism or atheism is more\nprobable than the other. \n It follows from (3) that\n\n\n(4)Agnosticism\nis true: neither theism nor atheism is known\nto be true. \n\n\n\nLe Poidevin takes \u201ctheism\u201d in its broadest sense to refer\nto the proposition that there exists a being that is the ultimate and\nintentional cause of the universe\u2019s existence and the ultimate\nsource of love and moral knowledge (2010: 52). (He doesn\u2019t use\nthe term \u201cversatile theism\u201d, but this would be his account\nof its meaning.) By the \u201cintrinsic probability\u201d of a\nproposition, he means, roughly, the probability that a proposition has\n\u201cbefore the evidence starts to come in\u201d (2010: 49). This\nprobability depends solely on a priori considerations like\nthe intrinsic features of the content of the proposition in question\n(e.g., the size of that content).\n\nLe Poidevin defends the first premise of this argument by stating\nthat, while intrinsic probability plausibly depends inversely on the\nspecificity of a claim (the less specific the claim, the more ways\nthere are for it to be true and so the more probable it is that it is\ntrue), it is impossible to show that versatile theism is more specific\nor less specific than its denial. This defense appears to be\nincomplete, for Le Poidevin never shows that the intrinsic probability\nof a proposition depends only on its specificity, and there\nare good reasons to believe that this is not the case (see, for\nexample, Swinburne 2001: 80\u2013102). Le Poidevin could respond,\nhowever, that specificity is the only uncontroversial criterion of\nintrinsic probability, and this lack of consensus on other criteria is\nall that is needed to adequately defend premise\n (1).\n\nOne way to defend the second premise is to review the relevant\nevidence and argue that it is ambiguous (Le Poidevin 2010: chapter 4;\nand Draper 2002). Another way is to point out that atheism, which is\njust the proposition that theism is false, is compatible with a\nvariety of very different hypotheses, and these hypotheses vary widely\nin how well they account for the total evidence. Thus, to assess how\nwell atheism accounts for the total evidence, one would have to\ncalculate a weighted average of how well these different atheistic\nhypotheses account for the total evidence, where the weights would be\nthe different intrinsic probabilities of each of these atheistic\nhypotheses. This task seems prohibitively difficult (Draper 2016) and\nin any case has not been attempted, which supports the claim that\nthere is no firm basis upon which to judge whether the total evidence\nsupports theism or atheism.\n\nSo-called \u201cReformed epistemologists\u201d (e.g., Plantinga\n2000) might challenge the second premise of the argument on the\ngrounds that many beliefs about God, like many beliefs about the past,\nare \u201cproperly basic\u201d\u2014a result of the functioning of\na basic cognitive faculty called the \u201csensus\ndivinitatis\u201d\u2014and so are, in effect, a part of the\ntotal evidence with respect to which the probability of any statement\ndepends. The agnostic, however, might reply that this sense of the\ndivine, unlike memory, operates at most sporadically and far from\nuniversally. Also, unlike other basic cognitive faculties, it can\neasily be resisted, and the existence of the beliefs it is supposed to\nproduce can easily be explained without supposing that the faculty\nexists at all. Thus, the analogy to memory is weak. Therefore, in the\nabsence of some firmer basis upon which to judge that beliefs about\nGod are properly a part of the foundation of some theists\u2019\nbelief systems, premise\n (2)\n stands.\n\nOf course, even if the two premises of Le Poidevin\u2019s argument\nare true, it doesn\u2019t follow that the argument is a good one. For\nthe argument also contains two inferences (from steps\n 1\n and\n 2\n to\n step 3\n and from step 3 to\n step 4),\n neither of which is obviously correct. Concerning the first\ninference, suppose, for example, that even though there is no firm\nbasis upon which to judge which of theism and atheism is intrinsically\nmore probable (that is, Le Poidevin\u2019s first premise is true),\nthere is firm basis upon which to judge that theism is not many times\nmore probable intrinsically than some specific version of atheism,\nsay, reductive physicalism. And suppose that, even though there is no\nfirm basis upon which to judge which of theism and atheism is favored\nby the total evidence (that is, Le Poidevin\u2019s second premise is\ntrue), there is firm basis upon which to judge that the total evidence\nvery strongly favors reductive physicalism over theism (in the sense\nthat it is antecedently very many times more probable given reductive\nphysicalism than it is given theism). Then it follows that both of Le\nPoidevin\u2019s premises are true and yet (3) is false: there is a\nfirm basis (that includes the odds version of Bayes\u2019 theorem\napplied to theism and reductive physicalism instead of to theism and\natheism) to judge that reductive physicalism is more probable or even\nmany times more probable than theism and hence that theism is probably\nor even very probably false. Arguably, no similar strategy could be\nused to show that theism is probably true in spite of Le\nPoidevin\u2019s premises both being true. So it may be that Le\nPoidevin\u2019s premises, if adequately supported, establish that\ntheistic gnosticism is false (that is, that either agnosticism or\natheistic gnosticism is true) even if they don\u2019t establish that\nagnosticism is true.\n",
