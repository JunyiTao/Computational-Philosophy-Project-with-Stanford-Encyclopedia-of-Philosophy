    "main_text": "Origins of the Medieval Discussion\n1. Origins of the Medieval Discussion\n\nThe Liar Paradox was well known to antiquity. Its discovery is often\ncredited to Eubulides the Megarian (4th century BCE), on the basis of\na remark by Diogenes Laertius (Lives of the Philosophers\nII.108), although in fact Diogenes says only that Eubulides discussed\nthe paradox, not that he discovered\n it.[2]\n A little later, the poet and grammarian Philetus (or Philitas) of Cos\n(c. 330\u2013c. 270 BCE), if we are to believe the story in Athenaeus\nof Naucratis\u2019s Deipnosophists IX.401e, worried so much\nover the Liar that he wasted away and died of insomnia, as, according\nto Athenaeus, his epitaph recorded:\n\n\nPhiletus of Cos am I\n\n\u2019Twas The Liar who made me die,\n\nAnd the bad nights caused\n thereby.[3]\n\n\nDiogenes Laertius also reports (VII.196\u201398) that, in addition to\na huge number of other works on a variety of topics, the Stoic\nlogician Chrysippus (c. 279\u2013206 BCE) wrote:\n\nIntroduction to the Liar;\nLiar Propositions: An Introduction;\nsix books on the Liar itself;\nReply to Those Who Think There Are Propositions That Are Both\nTrue and False;\nReply to Those Who Solve the Liar Proposition by\nDivision;\nOn the Solution to the Liar (in three books);\nReply to Those Who Say The Liar Argument Has False\nPremises.\n\n\nUnfortunately, almost none of Chrysippus\u2019 work survives.\n",
