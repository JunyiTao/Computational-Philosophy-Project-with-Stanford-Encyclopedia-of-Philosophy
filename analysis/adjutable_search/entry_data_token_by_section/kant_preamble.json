    "main_text": "\n\nImmanuel Kant (1724\u20131804) is the central figure in modern\nphilosophy. He synthesized early modern rationalism and empiricism,\nset the terms for much of nineteenth and twentieth century philosophy,\nand continues to exercise a significant influence today in\nmetaphysics, epistemology, ethics, political philosophy, aesthetics,\nand other fields. The fundamental idea of Kant\u2019s \u201ccritical\nphilosophy\u201d \u2013 especially in his three Critiques: the\nCritique of Pure Reason (1781, 1787), the Critique of\nPractical Reason (1788), and the Critique of the Power of\nJudgment (1790) \u2013 is human autonomy. He argues that the\nhuman understanding is the source of the general laws of nature that\nstructure all our experience; and that human reason gives itself the\nmoral law, which is our basis for belief in God, freedom, and\nimmortality. Therefore, scientific knowledge, morality, and religious\nbelief are mutually consistent and secure because they all rest on the\nsame foundation of human autonomy, which is also the final end of\nnature according to the teleological worldview of reflecting judgment\nthat Kant introduces to unify the theoretical and practical parts of\nhis philosophical system. \n",
