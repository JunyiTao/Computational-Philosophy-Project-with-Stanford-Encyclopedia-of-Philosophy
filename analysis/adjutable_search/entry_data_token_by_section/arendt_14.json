    "main_text": "Arendt\u2019s Theory of Judgment || Judgment and the Vita Activa\n5.5 Judgment and the Vita Activa\n\n\nArendt presented a model of judgment in the essays \u201cThe Crisis\nin Culture\u201d and \u201cTruth and Politics\u201d which could be\ncharacterized as far more \u2018political\u2019 than the one\npresented so far. In these essays, in fact, she treated judgment as a\nfaculty that enables political actors to decide what courses of action\nto undertake in the public realm, what kind of objectives are most\nappropriate or worth pursuing, as well as who to praise or blame for\npast actions or for the consequences of past decisions. In this model\njudgment is viewed as a specifically political ability,\nnamely, as \u201cthe ability to see things not only from one\u2019s own\npoint of view but from the perspective of all those who happen to be\npresent,\u201d and as being \u201cone of the fundamental abilities\nof man as a political being insofar as it enables him to orient\nhimself in the public realm, in the common world\u201d (BPF,\n221). Arendt claims that \u201cthe Greeks called this ability [to\njudge] phronesis, or insight, and they considered it the\nprincipal virtue or excellence of the statesman in distinction from\nthe wisdom of the philosopher. The difference between this judging\ninsight and speculative thought lies in that the former has its roots\nin what we usually call common sense, which the latter constantly\ntranscends.  Common sense \u2026 discloses to us the nature of the\nworld insofar as it is a common world; we owe to it the fact that our\nstrictly private and \u2018subjective\u2019 five senses and their\nsensory data can adjust themselves to a non-subjective and\n\u2018objective\u2019 world which we have in common and share with\nothers. Judging is one, if not the most, important activity in which\nthis sharing-the-world-with-others comes to pass\u201d (BPF,\n221).\n\n\nMoreover, in discussing the non-coercive character of judgment, the\nfact that it can only appeal to but never force the agreement of\nothers, she claims that \u201cthis \u2018wooing\u2019 or persuading\ncorresponds closely to what the Greeks called peithein, the\nconvincing and persuading speech which they regarded as the typically\npolitical form of people talking with one another\u201d (BPF, 222).\nSome commentators have claimed that there is a contradiction in\nArendt\u2019s employment of the Aristotelian notion of phronesis\nalongside Kant\u2019s idea of an \u201cenlarged mentality,\u201d since\nthey supposedly pull in opposite directions, the former toward a\nconcern with the particular, the latter toward universality and\nimpartiality. However, this contradiction is more apparent than real,\nsince Kant\u2019s theory of aesthetic judgment is a theory of\nreflective judgment, that is, of those judgments where the\nuniversal is not given but must be searched out of the particular. In\nthis respect the theory of aesthetic judgment to which Arendt appeals\ndoes have close affinities with Aristotle\u2019s notion of\nphronesis: both are concerned with the judgment of\nparticulars qua particulars, not with their subsumption under\nuniversal rules. If a distinction is to be made, it has more to do\nwith the mode of asserting validity: In Aristotle\nphronesis is the privilege of a few experienced individuals\n(the phronimoi) who, over time, have shown themselves to be\nwise in practical matters; the only criterion of validity is their\nexperience and their past record of judiciuos actions. In the case of\njudgments of taste, on the other hand, individuals have to appeal to\nthe judgments and opinions of others, and thus the validity of their\njudgments rests on the consent they can elicit from a community of\ndifferently situated subjects.\n\n\nFor Arendt the validity of political judgment depends on our ability\nto think \u201crepresentatively,\u201d that is, from the standpoint\nof everyone else, so that we are able to look at the world from a\nnumber of different perspectives. And this ability, in turn, can only\nbe acquired and tested in a public forum where individuals have the\nopportunity to exchange their opinions on particular matters and see\nwhether they accord with the opinions of others. In this respect the\nprocess of opinion formation is never a solitary activity; rather, it\nrequires a genuine encounter with different opinions so that a\nparticular issue may be examined from every possible standpoint until,\nas she puts it, \u201cit is flooded and made transparent by the full\nlight of human comprehension\u201d (BPF, 242). Debate and discussion,\nand the capacity to enlarge one\u2019s perspective, are indeed crucial to\nthe formation of opinions that can claim more than subjective\nvalidity; individuals may hold personal opinions on many subject\nmatters, but they can form representative opinions only by\nenlarging their standpoint to incorporate those of others. As Arendt\nsays:\nPolitical thought is representative. I form an opinion by\nconsidering a given issue from different viewpoints, by making present\nto my mind the standpoints of those who are absent; that is, I\nrepresent them \u2026 The more people\u2019s standpoints I have present\nin my mind while I am pondering a given issue, and the better I can\nimagine how I would feel and think if I were in their place, the\nstronger will be my capacity for representative thinking and the more\nvalid my final conclusions, my opinion. (BPF, 241)\n\nOpinions, in fact, are never self-evident. In matters of opinion, but\nnot in matters of truth, \u201cour thinking is truly discursive,\nrunning, as it were, from place to place, from one part of the world\nto another, through all kinds of conflicting views, until it finally\nascends from these particularities to some impartial generality\u201d\n(BPF, 242). In this respect one is never alone while forming an\nopinion; as Arendt notes, \u201ceven if I shun all company or am\ncompletely isolated while forming an opinion, I am not simply together\nonly with myself in the solitude of philosophical thought; I remain in\nthis world of universal interdependence, where I can make myself the\nrepresentative of everybody else\u201d (BPF, 242).\n",
