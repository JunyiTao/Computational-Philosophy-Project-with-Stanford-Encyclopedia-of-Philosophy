    "main_text": "Perceptual Phenomena || Attention\n2.4 Cognitive Penetration\n\nAccording to one empiricist tradition, experience functions as a\nmirror, reflecting what is before the subject, without any\nmanipulation by the subject\u2019s mind. Given that experience is\nsupposed to not be influenced by one\u2019s theories or expectations,\nit is thereby supposed to be in an optimal position to confirm or\ndisconfirm hypotheses about the world. According to a wide range of\nphilosophers and scientists, such a picture of the nature of\nexperience is mistaken, putting limitations on the ability of\nexperience to justify belief. In the philosophy of science, the\nchallenge has been put in terms of the \u201ctheory-dependence of\nobservation\u201d, and the implications thereof. In more recent\nepistemology and philosophy of mind, the challenge has been put in\nterms of \u201ccognitive penetration\u201d or \u201ctop-down\u201d\neffects and the implications thereof.\n\nTo survey the debate, we\u2019ll start with the philosophy of mind by\nconsidering potential examples of the phenomenon, and we will then\nturn to questions in epistemology.\n\nOne potential source of examples comes from ambiguous figures such as\nthe Necker cube (Hanson 1958; Kuhn 1962; Churchland 1979, 1988).\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Necker\n Cube[4]\n\n\nYou can see this figure as a downward-tilted cube with the left face\nclosest to you, or as an upward-tilted cube with the right face\nclosest to you. Critics dispute whether such examples support any\nthesis of theory-dependence of observation. An alternative\nresponse is that you experience the figure in different ways merely\nbecause you attend to different parts of the figure at different\ntimes. Here the difference in your experience is not explained by\ndifferences in what theory you hold (Fodor 1984).\n\nTheorists such as Hanson, Kuhn and Churchland also made much of work\nby so-called \u201cNew Look\u201d psychologists such as Bruner and\nPostman. Consider for instance Bruner and Postman\u2019s classic 1949\nexperiment involving anomalous playing cards. In this experiment,\nsubjects were briefly shown the following sort of card:\n\n\n\nFigure 5\n\n\nWhat did you just see? When subjects were exposed to this sort of\ncard, many reported it to be a six of hearts. The card is actually a\nred six of spades.\n\nOne might claim that the card looked to you the way red sixes of\nhearts look to you. However, there is much skepticism about whether\nthere is an effect here on perceptual experience itself (Fodor 1983;\nPylyshyn 1999). Perhaps the card fails to look like a red six of\nhearts to you, and you simply jumped to the conclusion that it is a\nred six of hearts when you form your belief. The effect might merely\nhave been on beliefs formed on the basis of perceptual experience.\n\nThe current debate about cognitive penetration is informed by more\nrecent experiments in psychology. For a case of a top-down effect in\nthe current literature, consider \u201cmemory color\u201d in Hansen\net al.\u2019s banana (2006). When subjects were asked to adjust an\nimage of a characteristically yellow object until it was achromatic,\nthey overcompensated by adjusting until the image was slightly bluish.\nSubjects did not overcompensate with objects that were not\ncharacteristically yellow. The type of case presented by Hansen et al.\nis much harder to explain away as not really involving top-down\neffects than those in the classic philosophy of science literature.\n(For related examples, see Delk and Fillenbaum 1965 or Olkkonen,\nHansen, and Gegenfurtner 2008. For further discussion of whether and\nhow there might be top-down effects on perception, see Macpherson\n2012, Deroy 2013, Firestone and Scholl 2016; Green 2020).\n\nLet us now turn to the epistemology of cases of cognitive\npenetration.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether all cases of top-down effects are\nproblematic for perceptual justification. Consider the possibility of\ntop-down effects from expertise. For example, perhaps the expert\nradiologist sees more than the novice when looking at an x-ray, and\nperhaps the expert chess-player sees more than the novice when looking\nat a chessboard in mid-game (see the papers in Ericsson 2006 for\ndiscussion of such examples). Further, suppose that the expertise\nexamples are genuine cases of top-down influence. Here the expert is\npresumably at an epistemic advantage thanks to top-down effects, where\nher experience justifies her with respect to those contents that her\nexperience has thanks to her cognitive background (Siegel 2012).\n\nTo see why some cases of top-down effects might be epistemically\nproblematic, consider Siegel\u2019s (2012) hypothetical case of\n\u201cAngry Looking Jack\u201d. Suppose that Jill antecedently has\nan unjustified belief that Jack is angry at her. The next time she\nsees him, he does look angry to her\u2014as a result of a top-down\neffect from her belief. In response to her experience, Jill then\nreaffirms her belief. Is she now justified in believing that Jack is\nangry at her? (Markie 2005 presents a related example of a gold\nprospector whose wishful thinking makes a nugget visually seem to be\ngold).\n\nIf you are inclined to deny that Jill\u2019s belief is justified, you could\nappeal to an intuition that Jill is not justified by her experience in\nbelieving that Jack is angry at her (Siegel 2012). But others may not\nshare the intuition.\n\nAnother strategy is to give a further argument that Jill is not\njustified by her experience in believing that Jack is angry at her.\nFor arguments that appeal to an analogy with the unjustified formation\nof a belief on an unjustified belief, see McGrath (2013) and Siegel\n(2013) (Teng 2021 critically responds). For an argument that appeals\nto an analogy with the unjustified formation of beliefs on the basis\nof emotion, see Vance (2014).\n",
