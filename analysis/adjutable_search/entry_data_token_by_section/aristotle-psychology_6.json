    "main_text": "Mind\n7. Mind\n\n\nAristotle describes mind (nous, often also rendered as\n\u201cintellect\u201d or \u201creason\u201d) as \u201cthe part of the soul by which it\nknows and understands\u201d (De Anima iii 4, 429a9\u201310; cf.\niii 3, 428a5; iii 9, 432b26; iii 12, 434b3), thus characterizing it in\nbroadly functional terms. It is plain that humans can know and\nunderstand things; indeed, Aristotle supposes that it is our very\nnature to desire knowledge and understanding (Metaphysics i 1,\n980a21; De Anima ii 3, 414b18; iii 3, 429a6\u20138). In this way,\njust as the having of sensory faculties is essential to being an\nanimal, so the having of a mind is essential to being a human. Human\nminds do more than understand, however. It is equally essential to the\nhuman being to plan and deliberate, to ponder alternatives and\nstrategize, and generally to chart courses of action. Aristotle\nascribes these activities no less than understanding and contemplation\nto mind and consequently distinguishes the \u201cpractical mind\u201d (or\n\u201cpractical intellect\u201d or \u201cpractical reason\u201d) from \u201ctheoretical mind\u201d\n(or \u201ctheoretical intellect\u201d or \u201ctheoretical reason\u201d) ( Nicomachean\nEthics vi 8 1143a35-b5; see\n Aristotle: ethics).\n In all these ways,\ninvestigating this capacity of soul thus has a special significance for\nAristotle: in investigating mind, he is investigating what makes humans\nhuman.\n\n\nHis primary investigation of mind occurs in two chapters of De\nAnima, both of which are richly suggestive, but neither of which\nadmits of easy or uncontroversial exposition. In De Anima iii\n4 and 5, Aristotle approaches the nature of thinking by once again\ndeploying a hylomorphic analysis, given in terms of form reception.\nJust as perception involves the reception of a sensible form by a\nsuitably qualified sensory faculty, so thinking involves the reception\nof an intelligible form by a suitably qualified intellectual faculty\n(De Anima iii 4, 429a13\u201318). According to this model, thinking\nconsists in a mind\u2019s becoming enformed by some object of thought, so\nthat actual thinking occurs whenever some suitably prepared mind is\n\u201cmade like\u201d its object by being affected by it.\n\n\nThis hylomorphic analysis of thinking is evidently a simple\nextension of the general model of hylomorphic change exploited by\nAristotle in a host of similar contexts. Accordingly, Aristotle\u2019s\ninitial account of thinking will directly parallel his analysis of\nperception (De Anima iii 4, 429a13\u201318). That is, at least in\nschematic outline, Aristotle will offer the following approach. For any\ngiven thinker S and an arbitrary object of thought\nO:\n\n\nS thinks O if and only if: (i)\nS has the capacity requisite for receiving O\u2019s\nintelligible form; (ii) O acts upon that capacity by enforming\nit; and, as a result, (iii) S\u2019s relevant capacity becomes\nisomorphic with that form.\n\n\n\n\nUnsurprisingly, the same questions which arose in the case of\nperception also arise here. Most immediately, to understand Aristotle\u2019s\napproach to thinking, it is necessary to determine what it means to say\nthat a thinker\u2019s mind and its object become isomorphic.\n\n\nHere, at least, Aristotle points out what is obvious, that when a\nthinker\u2019s soul is made like its cognitive object, it does not become\none with some hylomorphic compound, but with its form: \u201cfor it is\nnot the stone which is in the soul, but its form\u201d (De\nAnima iii 8, 431b29\u2013432a1; cf. iii 4, 429a27). The suggestion is,\nthen, that when S comes to think of a stone, as opposed to\nmerely perceiving some particular stone, S has a faculty which\nis such that it can become one in form with that stone. Aristotle\nsometimes infers from this sort of consideration that thought is of\nuniversals, whereas perception is of particulars (De Anima ii\n5, 417b23, Posterior Analytics i 31, 87b37\u201388a7),\nthough he elsewhere will allow that we also have knowledge of\nindividuals (De Anima ii 5, 417a29; Metaphysics xiii\n10, 1087a20). These passages are not contradictory, since Aristotle may\nsimply be emphasizing that thought tends to proceed at a higher level\nof generality than perception, because of its trading in comparatively\nabstract structural features of its objects. A person can think of what\nit is to be a stone, but cannot, in any direct and literal sense of the\nterm, perceive this.\n\n\nHowever that may be, Aristotle\u2019s conception of thinking implicates\nhim in supposing that thought involves grasping the structural features\nof the objects of thought. To take an initially favorable case, when\nthinking that tree frogs are oviparous, S will be in\na psychic state whose internal structural states are, among other\nthings, one in form with tree frogs. Since S\u2019s soul does not\nbecome a tree frog when thinking of tree frogs (De\nAnima iii 8, 431b24\u201330), this form of isomorphism cannot be\nmere instantiation of the form being a tree frog. Rather,\nS\u2019s mind will evidently be one in form with the tree frog, to\nrevert to our earlier analogy, in something like the way a blueprint\nand the house of which it is the blueprint are one in form. There must\nbe a determinate and expressible structural isomorphism, even though\none could not say that the blueprint realizes the form of the house.\nHouses are, after all, necessarily three-dimensional.\n\n\nFor Aristotle, it is not a contingent state of affairs that\nS\u2019s mind does not realize the form being a tree frog in the\nway that tree frogs themselves do. On the contrary, the mind\ncannot realize a broad range of forms: the mind is, according\nto Aristotle, not \u201cmixed with the body\u201d, insofar as it,\nunlike the perceptual faculty, lacks a bodily organ (De Anima\niii 4, 429a24\u20137). As such, it would not be possible for the mind to\nrealize the form of a house in the way bricks and mortar instantiate\nsuch a form: houses provide shelter, something a mind, so understood,\ncannot do. Consequently, when claiming that minds become isomorphic\nwith their objects, Aristotle must understand the way in which minds\nbecome enformed as somehow attenuated or non-literal. Perhaps, though,\nthis should be plain enough. If a mind thinks something by being made\nlike it, then the way it is likened to what it thinks must be somehow\nrepresentational. Consequently, Aristotle is reasonably understood as\nholding that S thinks some object of thought O\nwhenever S\u2019s mind is made like that object by representing\nsalient structural features of O by being directly isomorphic\nwith them, without, that is, by simply realizing the form of O\nin the way O does.\n\n\nThis approach to the nature of thinking has some promising features.\nBoth in its own terms and in virtue of its fitting into a broader\npattern of explanation, Aristotle\u2019s hylomorphic analysis merits serious\nconsideration. At the same time, one of its virtues may appear also as\na vice. We noted in discussing Aristotle\u2019s hylomorphic analysis of\nchange generally that his account requires the existence of suitably\ndisposed subjects of change. Only surfaces can be affected so as to be\nchanged in color. An action, such as Socrates\u2019 becoming unnerved by a\nglance of Alcibiades, cannot be made white; it is simply not the\nappropriate sort of subject. So, hylomorphic change requires at least\nthe following two components: (i) something pre-existing to be the\npatient of the change, and (ii) that thing\u2019s being categorially suited\nto be changed in the way specified.\n\n\nAlready at the first stage, however, Aristotle\u2019s application of this\nhylomorphic analysis of change to thinking may seem an over-extension.\nFor he maintains directly that mind is \u201cnone of the things\nexisting in actuality before thinking\u201d (De Anima iii 4,\n429a24). His reasons for maintaining this thesis are complex, but\nderive ultimately from the forms of plasticity Aristotle believes the\nmind must manifest if it is to be capable of thinking all things\n(De Anima iii 4, 429a18). Now, if the mind is indeed nothing\nin actuality before thinking, it is hard to understand how the\nhylomorphic analysis of change and affection could be brought to bear\nin this arena. If some dough is made cookie-shaped, it is actually\ndough before being so enformed; even the sense organs, when made like\ntheir objects, are actually existing organs before being affected by\nthe objects of perception. So, given a conception of mind as not\nexisting in actuality before thinking, it is hard to appreciate how\nthinking lends itself to an analysis in terms of any recognizable\nhylomorphic approach to change.\n\n\nHow great a problem this will be depends in part upon how entrenched\nAristotle\u2019s commitment to the mind\u2019s being nothing in actuality before\nthinking turns out to be. It equally turns on how adaptable Aristotle\u2019s\nhylomorphic account of change proves to be. On this latter point,\nAristotle notes that according to his account, there are various\ndifferent types of change and alteration, illustrated by the difference\nbetween a brown fence\u2019s being painted white and a builder\u2019s taking up\nhis tools and beginning to build. In the first case, there is a\ndestruction and a loss, of the fence\u2019s original color; in the second\ncase, nothing is destroyed, but rather that which is already\ndispositionally F becomes occurrently F by engaging in\nsome F-ish activity. A builder is as such already able to\nbuild. When he begins building he becomes fully and actually a builder\nfor the duration of his working. In this way, he loses nothing, but\ninstead realizes an already established potential.\n\n\nThis second type of change, which Aristotle maintains is the\nappropriate model for many psychic activities, is either \u201cnot an\ninstance of alteration \u2026 or is a different kind of\nalteration,\u201d where one \u201cshould not speak of being affected,\nunless <one allows that> there are two kinds of alteration\u201d\n(De Anima ii 5, 417b6\u201316). Perhaps Aristotle\u2019s position will\nthen be that the mind, at least insofar as its cognitive capacities for\nthought are concerned, is simply such as to be enformed by any of an\ninfinite range of objects of thought. This would involve its being\nnothing determinate in itself; and far from being anomalous for\nAristotle, the mind would be in the cognitive realm precisely what the\nmost basic stuff, if there is a most basic stuff, would be in the\nmaterial realm. Both would manifest unconstrained plasticity; and so\neach would be characterized essentially in terms of their range of\npotentialities.\n\nThat said, it should be noticed that when it is detached from the\nidiosyncratic thesis that the mind is nothing in actuality before\nthinking, Aristotle\u2019s hylomorphic analysis of thought retains whatever\nplausibility it may have independently. For the suggestion that\nthinking is to be understood at least partially in terms of\nisomorphisms between our representational capacities and the objects of\nour cognition has had, for good reason, a durable appeal. To the degree\nthat hylomorphism is generally defensible, then, its application in\nthis domain provides a theoretically rich framework for investigating\nthe nature of thought. \n\n\nSupplement: The Active Mind of De Anima iii 5\n\n",
