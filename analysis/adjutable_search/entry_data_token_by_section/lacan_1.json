    "main_text": "Fundamental Concepts || Register Theory\n2.1 Register Theory\n\nThe theory of the three registers of the Imaginary, the Symbolic, and\nthe Real forms the skeletal framework for the various concepts and\nphases of most of Lacan\u2019s intellectual itinerary. His\ncharacterizations of each of the three registers, as well as of their\nrelations with each other, undergo multiple revisions and shifts over\nthe many years of his labors. As will become increasingly evident in\nwhat follows, the majority of Lacanian concepts are defined in\nconnection with all three registers. By the 1970s, with his\nmeditations on the topological figure of the Borromean knot\u2014this\nknotting of three rings, pictured on the coat of arms of the Borromeo\nfamily, is arranged such that if one ring is broken, all three are set\nfree in disconnection\u2014Lacan emphasizes the mutual dependence of\nthe registers on one another. Hence, loosely speaking, the Imaginary,\nthe Symbolic, and the Real can be thought of as the three fundamental\ndimensions of psychical subjectivity \u00e0 la Lacan.\nFurthermore, scholars sometimes segment Lacan\u2019s evolution into\nthree main periods, with each period being distinguished by the\npriority of one of the registers: the early Lacan of the Imaginary\n(1930s and 1940s), the middle Lacan of the Symbolic (1950s), and the\nlate Lacan of the Real (1960s and 1970s). However, such a neat and\nclean periodization should be taken with several grains of salt, since\nintricate continuities and discontinuities not conforming to this\nearly-middle-late schema are to be found across the entire lengthy\nspan of Lacan\u2019s teachings.\n2.1.1 The Imaginary\n\nLacan tends to associate (albeit not exclusively) the Imaginary with\nthe restricted spheres of consciousness and self-awareness. It is the\nregister with the closest links to what people experience as\nnon-psychoanalytic quotidian reality. Who and what one\n\u201cimagines\u201d other persons to be, what one thereby\n\u201cimagines\u201d they mean when communicatively interacting, who\nand what one \u201cimagines\u201d oneself to be, including from the\nimagined perspectives of others\u2014all of the preceding is\nencompassed under the heading of this register. Such a description\nindicates the ways in which the Imaginary points to core analytic\nideas like transference, fantasy, and the ego. In particular, the\nImaginary is central to Lacan\u2019s account(s) of ego-formation (as\nper the mirror stage\u2014see\n 2.2\n below).\n\nAs Lacan integrates his early work of the 1930s and 1940s with his\nstructuralism-informed theories of the 1950s, he comes to emphasize\nthe dependence of the Imaginary on the Symbolic. This dependency means\nthat more sensory-perceptual phenomena (images and experiences of\none\u2019s body, affects as consciously lived emotions, envisionings\nof the thoughts and feelings of others, etc.) are shaped, steered, and\n(over)determined by socio-linguistic structures and dynamics. With the\ngrowing importance of the Real in the 1960s and the Borromean knots of\nthe 1970s, it becomes clear that Lacan conceives of the Imaginary as\nbound up with both of the other two registers (incidentally, the\nImaginary and the Symbolic, when taken together as mutually\nintegrated, constitute the field of \u201creality,\u201d itself\ncontrasted with the Real). In fact, it could be maintained that the\nImaginary invariably involves category mistakes. More specifically, it\nis the register in which the other two registers are mistaken for each\nother: What is Real is misrecognized as Symbolic (for example, as in\nparticular sorts of obsessional-neurotic and paranoid-psychotic\nsymptoms, certain meaningless contingent occurrences at the level of\nthe material world of non-human objects are viewed as though they were\nmeaningful signs full of deep significance to be deciphered and\ninterpreted) and what is Symbolic is misrecognized as Real (for\nexample, as in psychosomatic-type \u201cconversion symptoms,\u201d\nunconscious mental conflicts encoded in language and ideas are\nsuffered as bodily afflictions and ailments).\n\nWith his choice of the word \u201cimaginary,\u201d Lacan indeed\nintends to designate that which is fictional, simulated, virtual, and\nthe like. However, the phenomena of the Imaginary are necessary\nillusions (to put it in Kantian locution) or real abstractions (to put\nit in Marxian parlance). This signals two points. First, as one of\nLacan\u2019s three basic, essential registers, the Imaginary is an\nintrinsic, unavoidable dimension of the existences of speaking\npsychical subjects; just as an analysis cannot (and should not try to)\nrid the analysand of his/her unconscious, so too is it neither\npossible nor desirable to liquidate the illusions of this register.\nSecond, the fictional abstractions of the Imaginary, far from being\nmerely \u201cunreal\u201d as ineffective, inconsequential\nepiphenomena, are integral to and have very concrete effects upon\nactual, factual human realities.\n2.1.2 The Symbolic\n\nThe Lacanian Symbolic initially is theorized on the basis of resources\nprovided by structuralism. Tied to natural languages as characterized\nby Saussure and specific post-Saussurians, this register also refers\nto the customs, institutions, laws, mores, norms, practices, rituals,\nrules, traditions, and so on of cultures and societies (with these\nthings being entwined in various ways with language). Lacan\u2019s\nphrase \u201csymbolic order,\u201d which encompasses all of the\npreceding, can be understood as roughly equivalent to what Hegel\ndesignates as \u201cobjective spirit.\u201d This non-natural\nuniverse is an elaborate set of inter-subjective and trans-subjective\ncontexts into which individual human beings are thrown at birth (along\nthe lines of Heideggerian Geworfenheit), a pre-existing order\npreparing places for them in advance and influencing the vicissitudes\nof their ensuing lives.\n\nAccording to Lacan, one of the (if not the) most significant and\nindispensable conditions of possibility for singular subjectivity is\nthe collective symbolic order (sometimes named \u201cthe big\nOther,\u201d a phrase to be unpacked further shortly\u2014see\n 2.3\n below). Individual subjects are what they are in and through the\nmediation of the socio-linguistic arrangements and constellations of\nthe register of the Symbolic. Especially during the period of the\n\u201creturn to Freud,\u201d the analytic unconscious (qua\n\u201cstructured like a language\u201d) is depicted as kinetic\nnetworks of interlinked signifiers (i.e., \u201csignifying\nchains\u201d). Rendered thusly, the unconscious, being of a Symbolic\n(anti-)nature in and of itself, is to be interpretively engaged with\nvia the Symbolic medium of speech, namely, the very substance of the\nbeing-in-itself of the speaking subject (parl\u00eatre) of\nthe unconscious. Furthermore, the Lacanian unconscious is structured\nlike \u201cun langage\u201d and not \u201cune\nlangue.\u201d Although both French words translate into English\nas \u201clanguage,\u201d the former (langage) refers to\nlogics and structures of syntax and semantics not necessarily specific\nto particular natural languages, whereas the latter (langue),\nwhich also could be translated into English as \u201ctongue,\u201d\ndoes refer to the notion of a natural language. Hence, Lacan is not\nsaying that the unconscious is structured like French, German,\nEnglish, Spanish, or any other particular natural language.\n\nAlthough the register of the Symbolic comes to the fore only with\nLacan\u2019s structuralist phase of the 1950s, it arguably is not\nwithout its precursors in his earlier texts. Already in 1938, the idea\nof the \u201ccomplex\u201d in the encyclopedia article on \u201cThe\nFamily Complexes\u201d anticipates how Lacan recasts the Freudian\nOedipus complex via L\u00e9vi-Straussian structural anthropology.\nSimilarly, the prisoners\u2019 dilemma scenario narrated in\n1945\u2019s \u201cLogical Time and the Assertion of Anticipated\nCertainty\u201d illustrates how a formal, game-theoretic apparatus\ngoverns the lived experiences of subjects inserted into it. Moreover,\nthe 1949 \u00e9crit on \u201cThe Mirror Stage\u201d hints\nat the enabling background presence of a socio-symbolic milieu\n(incarnated first and foremost by parental caregivers) as the trigger\nprompting the child\u2019s identification with mirrored images of\nhim/her-self (as I will discuss subsequently here, this hint is\nexpanded and embellished upon by Lacan in 1960s-era revisions of the\nmirror stage\u2014see\n 2.2\n below).\n\nDespite the rise to prominence of the register of the Real beginning\naround 1959\u20131960, the Symbolic continues to play pivotal roles\nin Lacan\u2019s teachings right up until the start of the 1980s. For\ninstance, in Seminar XVII (1969\u20131970) and the\ncontemporaneous interview \u201cRadiophonie,\u201d Lacan\nforges his theory of the \u201cfour discourses\u201d (those of the\n\u201cmaster\u201d, \u201cuniversity,\u201d\n\u201chysteric,\u201d and \u201canalyst\u201d) to reflect the\ninterlinked permutations of multiple kinds of \u201csocial\nlinks\u201d configuring the relations between speaking subjects. More\ngenerally, the later Lacan remains reliant on the notion of the Real\nsides of the Symbolic, these being signifiers in their meaningless,\nnonsensical materiality as visible marks and audible sounds (i.e.,\n\u201cletters\u201d in Lacan\u2019s technical sense)\u2014and this\nby contrast with the Imaginary sides of the Symbolic, in which\nsignifiers are paired with signifieds to form meaningful, significant\nsigns (\u00e0 la Saussure\u2019s classic explanation of\nsuccessful communication via natural language). Such senseless\nsignifiers and their enchainings amount to a late Lacanian rendition\nof Freudian primary processes as the thinking distinctive of\nunconscious mindedness.\n\nWhen Lacan mentions \u201cstructure,\u201d a word to which he has\nfrequent recourse, he usually is thinking of his register of the\nSymbolic. Between the periods of his \u201creturn to Freud\u201d and\nlater teachings, Lacan reconsiders and alters what is conceptualized\nunder the heading of the \u201clike a language\u201d (comme un\nlangage) part of his fundamental claim that, \u201cthe\nunconscious is structured like a language.\u201d However, from the\n1950s until his death, his specific rendition of Freud\u2019s\ndiscovery consistently holds to the thesis that, \u201cthe\nunconscious is structured.\u201d That is to say, the unconscious, as\nbound up with that which is Symbolic, is an intricate, labyrinthine\nweb of ideational representations interconnected in multiple\nsophisticated manners. Contrary to the crudeness of commonplace vulgar\npicturings of Freudian analysis as an irrationalist, neo-romantic\npsychology of the unruly natural depths, the unconscious is not the\nid, namely, an anarchic seething cauldron of unthinking animalistic\ninstincts (i.e., something unstructured).\n2.1.3 The Real\n\nThe register of the Real is tricky to encapsulate and evades being\npinned down through succinct definitions. Lacan\u2019s numerous and\nshifting pronouncements apropos the Real are themselves partly\nresponsible for this absence of straightforwardness. But, rather than\nbeing just a barrier to grasping the Real, this absence is itself\nrevelatory of this register. To be more precise, as that which is\nforeign to Imaginary-Symbolic reality\u2014this reality is the realm\ncontaining conscious apprehension, communicable significance, and the\nlike\u2014the Real is intrinsically elusive, resisting by nature\ncapture in the comprehensibly meaningful formulations of\nconcatenations of Imaginary-Symbolic signs. It is, as Lacan stresses\nagain and again, an \u201cimpossibility\u201d\nvis-\u00e0-vis reality.\n\nLacan\u2019s earliest employments of the term \u201cReal\u201d use\nit to refer to material being(s) an sich, namely, to physical\nexistents handled as roughly equivalent to Kant\u2019s\nthings-in-themselves. The Real hence would be whatever is beyond,\nbehind, or beneath phenomenal appearances accessible to the direct\nexperiences of first-person awareness. This characterization of the\nReal persists into the first versions of Lacan\u2019s mature register\ntheory as initially elaborated throughout the 1950s. During this\ndecade of the \u201creturn to Freud,\u201d the Real also gets\nconnected to Lacan\u2019s contemporaneously emerging conceptions of\npsychosis and Otherness (the latter to be addressed soon\u2014see\n 2.3\n below). Additionally, in the 1950s, Lacan tends to speak of the Real\nas an absolute fullness, a pure plenum devoid of the negativities of\nabsences, antagonisms, gaps, lacks, splits, etc. Portrayed thusly, the\nSymbolic is primarily responsible for injecting such negativities into\nthe Real. For instance, only though the powers of language can\nmaterial being in itself be said to be \u201cmissing\u201d things,\nsince, on its own, this dimension of being always is simply whatever\nit is in its dumb, idiotic presence as never more and never less than\nsheer, indifferent plenitude.\n\nAs I noted above, the seventh seminar of 1959\u20131960 marks a shift\naway from the privileging of the Symbolic over the course of the 1950s\nand toward prioritizing the Real. The Real prior to Seminar\nVII tends to be depicted in non-dialectical and/or quasi-Kantian\nterms. Although Kant is one of the main explicit foci during this\nacademic year, Lacan\u2019s sustained reformulation of the Real in\nthis seminar introduces quasi-Hegelian dialectical features into it,\nthereby nuancing and complicating his ideas about this register. The\nnew Real involves convergences of opposites as a register of volatile\noscillations and unstable reversals between excesses and lacks,\nsurpluses and deficits, flooding presences and draining absences. In\nthe seventh seminar, Lacan puts forward the figure of the mother as\nthe key analytic referent justifying this rendition of the Real (a\nfigure he relates to another figure, that of \u201cthe Lady\u201d in\nthe courtly love tradition). In the beginning of the\npsychical-libidinal subject\u2019s ontogentic life history, the\nmaternal caretaker is, at one and the same time, both overwhelmingly,\nstiflingly present or near and, in her strange, impenetrable alterity,\nalso frustratingly, uncontrollably absent or inaccessible; there is\neither too much or too little of her, never the right balanced amount.\nWith the passage of time and the temporal transformations of the\nlibidinal economy, the mother, as this archaic Real Other, becomes the\nforever unattainable \u201cSovereign Good,\u201d the fixed vanishing\npoint, of all desiring (what Lacan calls, in dialogue with the history\nof philosophy as well as Freud, \u201cdas Ding\u201d\n[la Chose, the Thing]).\n\nThroughout the 1960s and up through the end of Lacan\u2019s\nteachings, the Real takes on an ever increasing number of aspects and\nconnotations. It becomes both a transcendence troubling and thwarting\nImaginary-Symbolic reality and its language from without as well as an\nimmanence perturbing and subverting reality/language from within. It\ncomes to be associated with libidinal negativities (objet petit\na, jouissance, and sexual difference, all to be\ndiscussed later\u2014see\n 2.3,\n 2.4.2, and\n 2.4.3\n below), material meaninglessness both linguistic (see\n 2.1.2\n above) and non-linguistic, contingent traumatic events, unbearable\nbodily intensities, anxiety, and death.\n\nAs regards the unconscious as the principle concern of psychoanalysis,\nthe later Lacan combines his earlier emphasis on socio-linguistic\nformations (\u00e0 la \u201cthe unconscious is structured\nlike a language\u201d) with a subsequent stress on forces and factors\ninternal but irreducible to these formations. After the 1950s, Real\ndimensions are added to the unconscious, with its Symbolic dimensions\nbeing made to orbit around black holes of unsymbolizability impossible\nto represent via the signifier-like ideational representations\n(Freud\u2019s Vorstellungen) of the language-like sides of\nthe unconscious. Nonetheless, the rise of the Real in Lacan\u2019s\nteachings does not amount to him converting to any sort of analytic\nrecapitulation of mysticisms or negative theologies. Instead, for\nLacan, analysis both theoretical and clinical permits delineating and\ntracking the Real with conceptual precision, if only as an exercise in\npinpointing the exact limits of the Imaginary, the Symbolic, and their\noverlappings.\n",
