    "main_text": "The structure of loyalty || The subjects of loyalty\n3.4 The subjects of loyalty\n\nIndividual persons are typically the one\u2019s who are loyal (i.e.,\nthe subjects of loyalty), but being loyal is not restricted to\nindividual persons. Mutuality is a feature of many loyalties, and it\nis often a normative expectation of the loyal individual that the\ncollectivity to which the individual is loyal will also be loyal in\nreturn (Ogunyemi, 2014). Just as we personify organizations, regarding\nthem as in some sense responsible actors, so we can attribute loyalty\nto them or\u2014more often\u2014 bemoan their lack of loyalty to\nthose who have been loyal to them.\n\nMay animals be loyal? Tales of canine loyalty are legion, and even\namong wild animals, especially those that move in social groups,\nloyalty is often said to be shown. To the extent that loyalty is seen\nas an adaptive sentiment, we may think that animals are capable of\nloyalty. That may be a convenient way of characterizing animal\nbehavior (what Aristotle refers to as a \u201cnatural\u201d virtue),\nthough, as Fletcher observes, the kind of loyalty shown is limited\nbecause such loyalty cannot be betrayed. The dog who is distracted by\nthe burglar\u2019s steak does not betray its owner; its training has\nsimply been inadequate. It is also limited because it is the kind of\nloyalty that, if displayed by humans, would be characterized as\n\u201cblind\u201d and therefore likely to expose one to moral peril\n(Blamires, 1963, 24).\n",
