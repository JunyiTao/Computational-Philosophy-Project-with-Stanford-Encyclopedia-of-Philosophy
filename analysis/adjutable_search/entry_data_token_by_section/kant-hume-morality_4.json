    "main_text": "Freedom and Necessity\n5. Freedom and Necessity\n\nHume and Kant both believe that freedom is essential to morality.\nMoreover, both believe that a philosophical theory and vindication of\nhuman morality requires reconciling freedom with universal causal\nnecessity (determinism). However, they offer different conceptions of\nfreedom, different ways of reconciling it with necessity, and\ndifferent views about why this reconciliation matters for morality.\nScholars agree that Hume is a \u201ccompatibilist\u201d, but there\nis no consensus on the correct label for Kant\u2019s position.\n\nHume defends compatibilism in section eight of Enquiry concerning\nHuman Understanding and Book Two of the Treatise\n(2.3.1\u20132). In the Treatise, Hume distinguishes between\ntwo conceptions of freedom or liberty: \u201cliberty of\nindifference\u201d and \u201cliberty of spontaneity\u201d.\nAccording to the idea of indifference, liberty implies \u201ca\nnegation of necessity and causes\u201d (T 2.3.2.1). For illustration,\nconsider the Anglican bishop John Bramhall\u2019s claim that genuine\nliberty is \u201ca liberty from necessity, or rather from\nnecessitation, that is, a universal immunity from all inevitability\nand determination\u201d (1645 [1999: 1]). On this view, a person is\nfree when, and only when, her action is not necessitated by\nany antecedent causes. Hume rejects this idea as\nunintelligible (T 2.3.1.18) and destructive to morality and religion\n(T 2.3.2.5). By contrast, he characterizes spontaneity as that idea of\nliberty \u201cwhich is oppos\u2019d to violence\u201d (T 2.3.2.1).\nTherefore, the liberty of spontaneity is freedom from violence, but\nnot freedom from necessity per se. \u201cViolence\u201d\nhere refers to various forms of unwanted interference with the\nexecution of one\u2019s will, as when a person is forced to sign a\ndocument or locked in a cell from which she wants to escape. These are\ncases where we lack the liberty of spontaneity. But a person has such\nliberty whenever she is able to do what she wants to do. In such\ncases, her actions are causally necessitated, just like any other\nevent in nature; but they are caused by motives that spring from her\nown character. According to Hume, this is the form of liberty at issue\nin religion, morality, law, and common life. Hence, spontaneity is the\nonly form of liberty \u201cwhich it concerns us to preserve\u201d (T\n2.3.2.1).\n\nThe liberty of spontaneity, as just described, is perfectly compatible\nwith causal necessity. There are two main reasons people often believe\notherwise. First, we tend to conflate the two ideas of liberty. In\ncases where we enjoy the liberty of spontaneity, our experience\nsuggests that we also enjoy something more. We recognize, of course,\nthat \u201cwe were influenc\u2019d by particular views and\nmotives\u201d, yet we find it difficult to \u201cperswade ourselves\nwe govern\u2019d by necessity, and that \u2019twas utterly\nimpossible for us to have acted otherwise\u201d (T 2.3.2.1). This is\nbecause \u201c[w]e feel that our actions are subject to our will on\nmost occasions, and imagine we feel that the will itself is subject to\nnothing\u201d (T 2.3.2.2). Yet the assumption that our will is\nsubject to nothing is a mistake caused by the blind spots of\nintrospection. An outside observer, whether a friend or a scientist,\n\u201ccan commonly infer our actions from our motives and character; and\neven where he cannot, he concludes in general, that he might, were he\nperfectly acquainted with every circumstance of our situation and\ntemper\u201d (T 2.3.2.2).\n\nThe second source of resistance to compatibilism stems from confusion\nabout necessity. People are prone to think that necessity rules out\nliberty because they conflate necessity with compulsion or force. They\nbelieve that when A causes B, A compels or forces B. Hume holds that\nthis is a mistake, however. Causal necessity is nothing more than the\n\u201cconstant conjunction\u201d of similar objects and a customary\ninference of the mind from the one to the other (EHU 8.1.5). For\nexample, experience shows that the vibration of a particular string is\nconstantly conjoined with a particular sound. As a result, the mind\ndevelops the habit of immediately inferring the sound from the\nvibration (EHU 7.2.29). We believe that the sound is causally\nnecessitated by the vibration, but the necessity is a product of the\nimagination, which associates the idea of the sound with the\nperception of the vibration. This feeling that there is a\nnecessary connection between them is the whole of the matter (EHU\n7.2.28). So defined, causal necessity no longer poses an obvious\nthreat to liberty. It makes sense to follow Bramhall\u2019s\ndefinition of liberty as \u201cliberty from necessity\u201d if one\nthinks that necessitation involves force or compulsion. But causes do\nnot force or compel their effects. If one can accept this point, then\na definition like Bramhall\u2019s seems less tempting, and necessity\nper se no longer poses a threat to liberty. The only real\nthreat is necessitation by external forces, as when a person is forced\nto do something she does not want to do.\n\nBroadly speaking, the scholarship offers two ways of interpreting\nHume\u2019s compatibilism. According to the most common approach,\nHume\u2019s arguments concern the logic of the concepts at issue. On\nthis reading, Hume analyzes the concepts of liberty and necessity to\nshow that, properly understood, they do not conflict. We can be\nrationally justified in holding a person responsible for her action\neven though all human actions are caused. The only question is whether\nshe, rather than some other person or external force, is the\ncause of her action. According to Paul Russell\u2019s naturalist\napproach, however, Hume\u2019s view is not primarily a piece of a\npriori reasoning about the logic of our concepts or the rational\njustification of attributions of moral responsibility. Above all it is\nan empirical explanation for why we sometimes feel that people are\nresponsible for their conduct. Hume\u2019s concern is with the\ncognitive processes that cause such attributions (Russell 1995: ch.\n4). He starts with the occasions in common life when we hold people\nresponsible for their behavior, and then asks, what happens in the\nmind on such occasions? On the standard reading, Hume\u2019s\ntreatment of liberty is a fairly self-contained set of compatibilist\narguments, quite detachable from his larger project. On the naturalist\nreading, it is deeply connected to his theory of the passions and\nmoral judgment, which makes it an integral part of his \u201cscience\nof man.\u201d\n\nHume claims that liberty, understood properly, is \u201cessential to\nmorality\u201d (EHU 8.31). The above interpretations provide two\ndifferent explanations for why this is the case. The standard approach\nsays that Hume\u2019s compatibilism is about the logic of our\nconcepts and the justification of our judgments. Our judgments about\nresponsibility entail judgments about the causal antecedents of\naction, and such judgments are consistent with determinism. On this\nview, the liberty of spontaneity is essential to morality because\nattributions of responsibility, which permeate morality (as well as\nlaw and religion), are unjust and unreasonable without it. According\nto the naturalist approach, liberty is essential for a different\nreason. The naturalist reading emphasizes that, on Hume\u2019s view,\nattributions of responsibility are made via feelings of\napproval and disapproval, not judgments (T 2.3.2.6; Russell 1995:\n60\u20134). They are, in his terminology, impressions or sentiments\nrather than ideas. These sentiments are partially caused by beliefs\nabout the source of the behavior to which we are responding. We would\nnot feel approval or disapproval unless we had been led to think of\nthe person as the cause of the action. If we believed that her action\nwas either compelled or uncaused, we would neither approve nor\ndisapprove of her. Our responses or thoughts would be about\nsomething else. Hume\u2019s claim, on the naturalist reading, is that\nin approving or disapproving of the agent\u2014in feeling gratitude\nor resentment, for example\u2014we hold her responsible, and in\nholding her responsible we believe that her conduct is free. Hume does\nnot argue that the latter justifies attributions of responsibility.\nHis claim is that it causally contributes to such attributions. They\nare made by means of feelings of approval and disapproval, which are a\ncore feature of human morality as we know it. Therefore, the idea of\nliberty, properly reconciled with necessity, is essential to\nmorality.\n\nLike Hume, Kant seeks to reconcile freedom with a commitment to causal\ndeterminism. Yet the two philosophers operate with different\nconceptions of causal necessity and very different conceptions of\nfreedom. For present purposes, it is important to focus on the latter.\nHume concentrates on the liberty of spontaneity, the only idea of\nfreedom \u201cwhich it concerns us to preserve\u201d. His treatment\nlooks downstream from the will to its execution in action. A person\nhas liberty when her action is caused by her will, which Hume equates\nwith an occurrent motive or desire (T 2.3.1.2). The question of what\nultimately moves the will is irrelevant. Such causes are found in the\nperson\u2019s character and circumstances, and they determine her\nwill with the same necessity that determines everything else in\nnature. Kant, by contrast, looks upstream to what determines the will:\n\u201cIt is here a question only of the determination of the will and\nof the determining ground of its maxims as a free will, not of its\nresult\u201d in bodily action (CPrR 5:45). One way of putting it is\nto say that Hume\u2019s account concerns the freedom of action, while\nKant\u2019s concerns freedom of the will. Both are concerned with the\nfreedom of the person or agent, but Kant thinks the person is not\ntruly free unless her will is free. This is the first point about the\nmain difference between Kant and Hume.\n\nThe second point is that Kant, unlike Hume, believes that the will is\nnot free unless it can be determined by pure reason. This is why he\nrepeatedly insists that the main question concerning freedom is\nwhether pure reason \u201ccan be an immediate determining ground of\nthe will, that is, of the causality of a rational being with respect\nto the reality of objects\u201d (CPrR 5:44\u201345). Furthermore,\nKant holds that this is a question of whether the will can be\ndetermined \u201cindependently of anything empirical\u201d (CPrR\n5:42). For when pure reason determines the will, the latter\u2019s\n\u201cground\u201d must be found in \u201cthe intelligible order of\nthings\u201d rather than in empirical order (CPrR 5:49). This is why\nKant thinks that \u201cthe concept of a being that has free\nwill\u201d involves the concept of a \u201cnoumenal\u201d cause\n(CPrR 5:55). Note that Kant\u2019s idea of noumenal causation is not\nequivalent to what Hume calls the liberty of indifference, which\nimplies a complete absence of causes or necessitation. To appreciate\nthe point, contrast Kant\u2019s view with what Bramhall calls\n\u201cliberty from necessitation\u201d or \u201cimmunity from all...\ndetermination.\u201d Unlike Bramhall, Kant seems to think that the will is\nfree if, and only if, it is necessitated. But the will must\nbe necessitated by the right sort of thing and in the right way:\nnamely, by pure reason rather than by an antecedent event whose causal\nimpact on the will could be described by an empirical law. That is,\nthe will is free if and only if can be determined by pure reason,\nwhich lies outside the realm governed by empirical laws.\n\nKant\u2019s conception of freedom has profound implications for the task of\nreconciling freedom with causal determinism. He maintains that all\nevents, including human actions, are causally determined by antecedent\nevents in accordance with empirical laws. But he also seeks to show\nthat this does not rule out free will (A536\u2013537/B564-565). On\nthe contrary, one and the same event can be both \u201ca mere effect\nof nature\u201d but also an \u201ceffect of freedom\u201d\n(A543/B571). Kant demonstrates this possibility by distinguishing\nbetween two different \u201cworlds\u201d and arguing that we belong\nto both. On the one hand, we belong to the \u201cphenomenal\u201d\nworld, where all our actions can be explained in terms of antecedent\nevents (whether physical or psychological). On the other hand,\nconsidered as a \u201cthing in itself\u201d, each of us belongs to\nthe \u201cnoumenal\u201d world, which is not subject to \u201cthe\ntemporal order in accord with empirical laws\u201d (A534/B562). We\ncannot know whether we belong to the noumenal world, but\nKant\u2019s theoretical philosophy secures room for this possibility,\nand his moral philosophy tries to show that when we become aware of\nmorality\u2019s categorical demands, we think of ourselves as members\nof this noumenal or \u201cintelligible world\u201d (G 4:457-58).\n\nWe can see here that Kant seeks to reconcile freedom and natural\nnecessity by means of \u201ctranscendental idealism.\u201d Indeed, the question\nof whether natural necessity rules out freedom is a\n\u201ctranscendental problem,\u201d and only transcendental\nphilosophy can solve it (A535/B563, A557/B585). The appeal to\ntranscendental idealism is controversial, of course. Some scholars of\nKant\u2019s ethics understand him to be making a metaphysical (or\nontological) claim when he distinguishes between noumenal and\nphenomenal worlds (e.g. McCarty 2009). Others understand Kant to be\ndistinguishing between only different standpoints we take, identifying\nthe noumenal world with the practical standpoint that we take when we\nthink of ourselves as autonomous, responsible beings, and the\nphenomenal world with the theoretical standpoint we take when we think\nof ourselves as part of the natural, deterministic, empirical world\n(see Beck 1960: 191\u201394; Korsgaard 1996a, esp. chs. 6\u20137).\nBoth raise concerns. Many find the notion of two worlds metaphysically\ncumbersome (at best); but others question whether the two standpoints\napproach is robust enough for Kant\u2019s purposes. (See Irwin 1984, esp.\n37\u201338; Allison 1990; Guyer 1992: 103\u2013107; and Wood 2005a:\n99\u2013100.)\n\nKant has several reasons for thinking that freedom is essential to\nmorality. First, freedom is necessary for moral responsibility. When\nwe hold a person responsible for blameworthy conduct, for example, we\n\u201cimpute\u201d the ability to have refrained from such conduct\nand blame the person for her failure to exercise this ability\nproperly. The judgment of \u201cblame is grounded on the law of\nreason, which regards reason as a cause that\u2026 could have and\nought to have determined the conduct of the person to be other than it\nis\u201d (A555/B583). Second, Kant holds that \u201cwhat is\nessential to any moral worth of actions is that the moral law\ndetermine the will immediately\u201d (CPrR 5:71). If a\nperson\u2019s will were necessitated by her circumstances and\nempirical character, as Hume maintains, it would be impossible to\nrespond properly to the moral law, which demands a kind of purity of\nthought and motive that Hume would not countenance. Third, freedom is\nessential to morality in that freedom is the ground of a special\nstatus or \u201cdignity\u201d that morality commands us to respect\nin ourselves and others. One important but unorthodox line of\ninterpretation suggests a fourth reason for thinking that freedom is\nessential to morality. According to this view, Kant holds (in at least\nsome places) that freedom is our most fundamental value, the source\nfrom which all other moral value derives. This is \u201cthe real\nbedrock of Kant\u2019s moral thought\u201d (Guyer 2000: 203). On\nthis view, in fact, we are commanded to obey the moral law because it\n\u201cis the necessary means for the realization of human\nfreedom\u201d (Guyer 2016: 38).\n\nWhen comparing Hume and Kant, it is a mistake to ask simply which\nphilosopher has the best account of freedom or does the best job of\nreconciling freedom and necessity. They disagree about both causal\nnecessity and the question of which idea of freedom \u201cit concerns\nus to preserve\u201d. As a result, they focus on somewhat different\ntopics. Hume concentrates on what happens downstream from the will,\nthat is, on how motives determine action. But Kant\u2019s attention\nis focused on what happens upstream\u2014on the question of what\ndetermines the will. It seems fair to say that from Kant\u2019s\nperspective, Hume\u2019s notion of liberty is thin gruel, no better\nthan \u201cthe freedom of a turnspit\u201d (CPrR 5:97) or the\nfreedom exhibited by a self-moving clock (CPrR 5:96). It also seems\nfair to say that from Hume\u2019s perspective, Kant\u2019s notion of\nfree will is, at best, a misguided fiction.\n\nOne important question is whether morality requires the sort of\nfreedom Kant has in mind. Hume would deny that it does, but this is\npartly because his view of morality itself is so different from\nKant\u2019s. The issue here is not just about free will. It is about\nwhich conception of morality is most plausible. If Kant has convincing\ngrounds for insisting on the unique nature of moral obligation or\njudgments of \u201cmoral worth\u201d, this puts some pressure on\nHume to take Kant\u2019s notion of free will more seriously. Another\nimportant question is how to interpret Kant\u2019s actual position,\nwhich is the subject of controversy. Standard textbooks classify Kant\nas a libertarian (incompatibilist) about free will, but those who\nstudy Kant most intensively often disagree about the nature of his\nview. Some argue that Kant offers a form of incompatibilism (e.g.,\nPereboom 2006; Allison 1990; Watkins 2005), while others maintain that\nhe is some sort of compatibilist, however unorthodox (e.g., Bennett\n1984; Hudson 1994). According to one influential interpretation, Kant\nendorses \u201cnot only the compatibility of freedom and determinism,\nbut also the compatibility of compatibilism and incompatibilism\u201d\n(Wood 1984: 74). These scholarly debates bear on the question of how\nKant\u2019s view compares to Hume\u2019s, as does the question of\nwhether the naturalist or traditional interpretation best captures\nHume\u2019s own position. Finally, when comparing Kant and Hume on\nthe question of freedom, one must recognize that there is a modest and\nskeptical side to Kant\u2019s view that Hume would applaud. For Kant,\nfree will is an \u201cinscrutable faculty\u201d (CPrR 5:47), whose\noperations lie beyond the reach of human cognition. It is impossible\nto know whether we actually have free will (CPrR 5:72; G\n4:459). Indeed, Kant\u2019s significant debt to Hume is evident in\nthe former\u2019s claim that \u201call human insight is at an end as soon\nas we have arrived at basic powers or basic faculties\u201d (CPrR\n5:46). Here we find profound agreement between the two philosophers\nabout the limits of human insight.\n",
