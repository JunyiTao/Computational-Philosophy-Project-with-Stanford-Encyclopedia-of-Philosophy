Posthumous Harm\n\nAccording to Aristotle,\n\na dead man is popularly believed to be capable of having both good and\nill fortune\u2014honour and dishonour and prosperity and the loss of\nit among his children and descendants generally\u2014in exactly the\nsame way as if he were alive but unaware or unobservant of what was\nhappening (Nicomachean Ethics 1.10)\n\n\nThe belief Aristotle reported in this passage is that a person may be\nbenefitted or harmed by things that happen while she is dead. Nagel\n(1970, p. 66) agrees; drawing upon his indefinitist approach he says\nthat \u201ca man's life includes much that does not take place within\nthe boundaries \u2026 of his life\u201d and that \u201cthere is a\nsimple account of what is wrong with breaking a deathbed promise. It\nis an injury to the dead man.\u201d If something that occurs while a\nperson is dead is bad for her, let us say that it is responsible for\nposthumous harm. (But this way of speaking is potentially\nmisleading, as theorists who argue that posthumous events may harm us\nneed not assume that the victims are worse off while they are dead.)\nIs there such a thing as posthumous harm?\n",
