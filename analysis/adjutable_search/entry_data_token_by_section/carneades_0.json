    "main_text": "Life and work\n1. Life and work\n\nBorn in Cyrene, then a Greek-speaking city on the Mediteranean coast\nof North Africa, Carneades pursued his philosophical studies in\nAthens, which was then as it had been and was to be for some time the\nphilosophical center of the ancient world. There he studied not only\nat the Academy, the school founded by Plato of which he was to become\nthe leader or scholarch, but also with with Diogenes of Babylon, the\nfifth scholarch of the Stoic school and a pupil of Chrysippus (c.\n208\u2013206 BCE). Chrysippus was the principal architect of the\nStoic system and the most important philosophical stimulus to\nCarneades, who is reported to have said, \u2018If Chrysippus had not\nbeen, I would not have been\u2019 (D.L. 4.62) (which echoes the\nsaying, \u2018If Chrysippus had not been, there would have been no\nStoa\u2019). Carneades became scholarch of the Academy sometime\nbefore 155 BCE, when, together with Diogenes and Critolaus, the head\nof Aristotle\u2019s school, the Peripatos, he was sent to Rome to\nrepresent Athens in a petition before the senate (see Powell,\n2013).\n\nAccording to tradition, Carneades also delivered a pair of lectures\nwhile in Rome, speaking in defense of justice on one day and, in\nrebuttal of his own arguments of the previous day, against it on the\nfollowing day. This celebrated episode is recounted or alluded to in a\nnumber of ancient sources, all of them much later, and doubts about\nevery part of the story including the reality of the lectures\nthemselves have been raised (see Drecoll, 2004; Powell, 2013). The\nspeech of Philus in the only partially extant third book of\nCicero\u2019s De Republica may preserve traces of\nCarneades\u2019 speech against justice, though it is a matter of\ncontroversy if and to what extent it does, or failing that it may draw\non arguments that Carneades made on other occasions (see Ferrary,\n1977; Glucker, 2001).\n\nLike Arcesilaus (316/15\u2013241/40 BCE), the head of the Academy who\nwas responsible for the school\u2019s so-called \u2018skeptical\nturn\u2019, and Socrates before him, Carneades wrote nothing, but\nmade his mark through face to face teaching and argument (D.L. 4.65).\nThe influence he exerted in this way was immense. From the time of his\nscholarchate until the dissolution of the Academy under its probably\nlast leader, Philo of Larissa (159/8\u201384/3 BCE), philosophical\nactivity in the Academy and among the philosophers in its orbit\nconsisted in good part in the further development of ideas and lines\nof argument pioneered or substantially reshaped by Carneades. Indeed\nthese philosophers often put forward their own views in the guise of\ninterpretations of Carneades. We are ultimately indebted for what we\nknow about him to works by those with firsthand experience of him,\nespecially Clitomachus, his student and eventual successor as\nscholarch. Although none of the latter\u2019s many books has\nsurvived, they were used by authors like Cicero (106-43 BCE) and\nSextus Empiricus (probably 2nd or 3rd century CE), whose works have\ncome down to us. (Greek and Latin testimonies are collected in Mette,\n1985; many important passages with an English translation and notes\ncan be found in Long and Sedley, 1987.)\n",
