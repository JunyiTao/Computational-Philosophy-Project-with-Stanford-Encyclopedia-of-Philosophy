    "main_text": "Accounts of Gratitude\n4. Accounts of Gratitude\n\nInformed by philosophical reflection on the elements of the grateful\nresponse\n (section 3),\n philosophers have developed various accounts of gratitude that\nconceptualize and classify it as a certain kind of phenomenon. This\nsection critically summarizes four prominent ways philosophers have\ntried to conceptualize and classify gratitude. All of these accounts\nhighlight important features of gratitude and its relationship to\nother concepts, like the vices of ingratitude or pride, or the\nnegative reactive attitude of resentment. Each conceptualization,\nhowever, does an imperfect job of accounting for all the elements of\nthe grateful response (though not all of them purport to be\ncomprehensive conceptualizations that account for every element of the\ngrateful response).\n",
