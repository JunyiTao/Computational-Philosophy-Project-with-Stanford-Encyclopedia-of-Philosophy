    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nInformation technology is ubiquitous in the lives of people across the\nglobe. These technologies take many forms such as personal computers,\nsmart phones, internet technologies, as well as AI and robotics. In\nfact, the list is growing constantly and new forms of these\ntechnologies are working their way into every aspect of daily life.\nThey all have some form of computation at their core and human users\ninterface with them mostly through applications and other software\noperating systems. In some cases, such as massive multiplayer online\ngames (see section 3.1.1 below), these\ntechnologies are even opening up new ways for humans to interacting\nwith each other. Information technologies are used to record,\ncommunicate, synthesize or organize information through the use of\ncomputer technologies. Information itself can be understood as any\nuseful data, instructions, or meaningful message content. The word\nliterally means to \u201cgive form to\u201d or to shape one\u2019s\nthoughts. A basic type of information technology might be the\nproverbial string tied around one\u2019s finger that is used to remind, or\ninform, someone that they have some specific task to accomplish that\nday. Here the string stands in for a more complex proposition such as\n\u201cbuy groceries before you come home.\u201d The string itself is\nnot the information, it merely symbolizes the information and\ntherefore this symbol must be correctly interpreted for it to be\nuseful. Which raises the question, what is information itself?\n Unfortunately there is not a completely satisfying and\nphilosophically rigorous definition available, though there are at\nleast two very good starting points. For those troubled by the\nontological questions regarding information, we might want to simply\nfocus on the symbols and define information as any meaningfully\nordered set of symbols.  Mathematicians and engineers prefer to focus\non this aspect of information, which is called \u201csyntax\u201d\nand leave the meaningfulness of information or its\n\u201csemantics\u201d for others to figure out. Claude E. Shannon\nworking at Bell Labs in the forties produced a landmark mathematical\ntheory of communication (1948).  In this work he utilized his\nexperiences in cryptography and telephone technologies to work out a\nmathematical formulation describing how syntactical information can be\nturned into a signal that is transmitted in such a way as to mitigate\nnoise or other extraneous signals which can then be decoded by the\ndesired receiver of the message (Shannon 1948; Shannon and Weaver\n1949). The concepts described by Shannon, (along with additional\nimportant innovations made by others who are too many to list),\nexplain the way that information technology works, but we still have\nthe deeper questions to resolve if we want to thoroughly trace the\nimpact of information technologies on moral values. Some philosophers\nnoted the fact that information technologies had highlighted the\ndistinction between syntax and semantics, and have been vocal critics\nabout the inability of technologies to bridge the gap between the two\nconcepts.  Meaning that while information technologies might be adept\nat manipulating syntax, they would be incapable of ever understanding\nthe semantics, or meanings, of the information upon which they\nworked.\nOne famous example can be found in the \u201cChinese Room\nArgument\u201d (Searle 1980) in which the philosopher John Searle\nargued that even if one were to build a machine that could take\nstories written in Chinese as input and then output coherent answers\nto questions about those stories, it would not prove that the machine\nitself actually understood what it was doing.  The argument rests on\nthe claim that if you replaced the workings of the machine with a\nperson who was not a native Chinese speaker who would then\npainstakingly follow a set of rules to transform the set of Chinese\nlogograms input into other output symbols.  The claim is that that\nperson would not understand the input and also would not know what the\nsystem is saying as its output, it is all meaningless symbol\nmanipulation to them.  The conclusion is that this admittedly strange\nsystem could skillfully use the syntax of the language and story while\nthe person inside would have no ability to understand the semantics,\nor meaning, of the stories (Searle 1980).  Replace the person with\nelectronics and it follows that the electronics also have no\nunderstanding of the symbols they are processing. This\nargument, while provocative is not universally accepted and has lead\nto decades worth of argument and rebuttal (see the entry on\n the Chinese room argument).  \nInformation technology has also had a lasting impression on the philosophical\nstudy of logic and information. In this field logic is used as a way to\nunderstand information as well as using information science as a way\nto build the foundations of logic itself (see the entry on \nlogic and information).\nThe issues just discussed are fascinating but they are separate\narguments that do not necessarily have to be resolved before we can\nenter a discussion on information technology and moral values.  Even\npurely syntactical machines can still impact many important ethical\nconcerns even if they are completely oblivious to the semantic meaning\nof the information that they compute. \n\nThe second starting point is to explore the more metaphysical role that\ninformation might play in philosophy. If we were to begin with the claim\nthat information either constitutes or is closely correlated with what\nconstitutes our existence and the existence of everything around us,\nthen this claim means that information plays an important ontological\nrole in the manner in which the universe operates. Adopting this\nstandpoint places information as a core concern for philosophy and\ngives rise to the fields \n philosophy of information\n and\n information ethics.\n In this entry, we will not limit our exploration to just the theory\nof information but instead look more closely at the actual moral and\nethical impacts that information technologies are already having on our\nsocieties. Philosophy of Information will not be addressed in detail\nhere but the interested reader can begin with Floridi (2010b, 2011b)\nfor an introduction. Some of the most important aspects of Information\nEthics will be outlined in more detail below.\n",
