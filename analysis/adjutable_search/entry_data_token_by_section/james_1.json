Early Writings\n\u201cRemarks on Spencer\u2019s Definition of Mind as Correspondence\u201d (1878)\n\nAlthough he was officially a professor of psychology when he published\nit, James\u2019s discussion of Herbert Spencer broaches\ncharacteristic themes of his philosophy: the importance of religion\nand the passions, the variety of human responses to life, and the idea\nthat we help to \u201ccreate\u201d the truths that we\n\u201cregister\u201d (E 21). Taking up Spencer\u2019s view that the\nadjustment of the organism to the environment is the basic feature of\nmental evolution, James charges that Spencer projects his own vision\nof what ought to be onto the phenomena he claims to describe.\nSurvival, James asserts, is merely one of many interests human beings\nhave: \u201cThe social affections, all the various forms of play, the\nthrilling intimations of art, the delights of philosophic\ncontemplation, the rest of religious emotion, the joy of moral\nself-approbation, the charm of fancy and of wit\u2014some or all of\nthese are absolutely required to make the notion of mere existence\ntolerable;\u2026\u201d (E 13). We are all teleological creatures at\nbase, James holds, each with a set of a priori values and\ncategories. Spencer \u201cmerely takes sides with the telos\nhe happens to prefer\u201d (E 18).\n\nJames\u2019s characteristic empiricism appears in his claim that\nvalues and categories fight it out in the course of human experience,\nand that their conflicts \u201ccan only be solved ambulando,\nand not by any a priori definition.\u201d The \u201cformula\nwhich proves to have the most massive destiny,\u201d he concludes,\n\u201cwill be the true one\u201d (E 17). Yet James wishes to defend\nhis sense that any such formulation will be determined as much by a\nfreely-acting human mind as by the world, a position he later (in\nPragmatism) calls \u201chumanism\u201d: \u201cthere\nbelongs to mind, from its birth upward, a spontaneity, a vote. It is\nin the game, and not a mere looker-on; and its judgments of the\nshould-be, its ideals, cannot be peeled off from the body of the\ncogitandum as if they were excrescences\u2026\u201d (E 21).\n\u201cThe Sentiment of Rationality\u201d (1879, 1882)\n\nThe substance of this essay was first published in Mind in\n1879 and in the Princeton Review in 1882, and then\nrepublished in The Will to Believe and Other Essays in Popular\nPhilosophy in 1897. Although he never quite says that rationality\nis a sentiment, James holds that a sentiment\u2014really a set of\nsentiments\u2014is a \u201cmark\u201d of rationality. The\nphilosopher, James writes, will recognize the rationality of a\nconception \u201cas he recognizes everything else, by certain\nsubjective marks with which it affects him. When he gets the marks, he\nmay know that he has got the rationality.\u201d These marks include a\n\u201cstrong feeling of ease, peace, rest\u201d (WB 57), and a\n\u201cfeeling of the sufficiency of the present moment, of its\nabsoluteness\u201d (WB 58). There is also a \u201cpassion for\nparsimony\u201d (WB 58) that is felt in grasping theoretical\nunifications, as well as a passion for distinguishing, a\n\u201cloyalty to clearness and integrity of perception, dislike of\nblurred outlines, of vague identifications\u201d (WB 59). The ideal\nphilosopher, James holds, blends these two passions of rationality,\nand even some great philosophers go too far in one direction or\nanother: Spinoza\u2019s unity of all things in one substance is\n\u201cbarren,\u201d as is Hume\u2019s \u201c\u2018looseness and\nseparateness\u2019 of everything\u2026\u201d (WB 60).\n\nSentiments of rationality operate not just in logic or science, but in\nordinary life. When we first move into a room, for example, \u201cwe\ndo not know what draughts may blow in upon our back, what doors may\nopen, what forms may enter, what interesting objects may be found in\ncupboards and corners.\u201d These minor uncertainties act as\n\u201cmental irritant[s],\u201d which disappear when we come to know\nour way around the room, to \u201cfeel at home\u201d there (WB\n67\u20138).\n\nJames begins the second part of his essay by considering the case when\n\u201ctwo conceptions [are] equally fit to satisfy the logical\ndemand\u201d for fluency or unification. At this point, he holds, one\nmust consider a \u201cpractical\u201d component of rationality. The\nconception that \u201cawakens the active impulses, or satisfies other\naesthetic demands better than the other, will be accounted the more\nrational conception, and will deservedly prevail\u201d (WB 66). James\nputs the point both as one of psychology\u2014a prediction of what\nwill occur\u2014and as one of judgment, for he holds that it will\nprevail \u201cdeservedly.\u201d \n\nAs in his essay on Spencer, James explores the relations between\ntemperaments and philosophical theorizing. Idealism, he holds,\n\u201cwill be chosen by a man of one emotional constitution,\nmaterialism by another.\u201d Idealism offers a sense of intimacy\nwith the universe, the feeling that ultimately I \u201cam all.\u201d\nBut materialists find in idealism \u201ca narrow, close, sick-room\nair,\u201d and prefer to conceive of an uncertain, dangerous and wild\nuniverse that has \u201cno respect for our ego.\u201d Let \u201cthe\ntides flow,\u201d the materialist thinks, \u201ceven though they\nflow over us\u201d (WB 76). James is sympathetic both to the idea\nthat the universe is something we can be intimate with and to the idea\nthat it is wild and unpredictable. If he criticizes idealism for its\n\u201csick-room air,\u201d he criticizes reductive forms of\nmaterialism for denying to \u201cour most intimate powers\u2026all\nrelevancy in universal affairs\u201d (WB 71). The intimacy and the\nwildness portrayed in these contrasting philosophies answer to\npropensities, passions, and powers in human beings, and the\n\u201cstrife\u201d of these two forms of \u201cmental\ntemper,\u201d James predicts, will always be seen in philosophy (WB\n76). Certainly it is always seen in the philosophy of William James.\n\n",
