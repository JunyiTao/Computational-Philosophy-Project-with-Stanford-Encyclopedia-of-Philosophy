    "main_text": "Alternative measures of uncertainty\n5. Alternative measures of uncertainty\n\nWhile the standard deviation is the most well-known quantitative\nmeasure for uncertainty or the spread in the probability distribution,\nit is not the only one, and indeed it has distinctive drawbacks that\nother such measures may lack. For example, in the definition of the\nstandard deviations\n (11)\n one can see that that the probability density function \n\\(\\abs{\\psi(q)}^2\\) is weighed by a quadratic factor \\(q^2\\) that\nputs increasing emphasis on its tails. Therefore, the value of\n\\(\\Delta_\\psi \\bQ\\) will depend predominantly at how this\ndensity behaves at the tails: if these falls off very quickly, e.g.,\nlike a Gaussian, it will be small, but if the tails drop off only\nslowly the standard deviation may be very large, even when most\nprobability is concentrated in a small interval.\n\nThe upshot of this objection is that having a lower bound on the\nproduct of the standard deviations of position and momentum, as the\nHeisenberg-Kennard uncertainty relation\n (9)\n gives, does not by itself rule out a state where both the\nprobability densities for position and momentum are extremely\nconcentrated, in the sense of having more than \\((1- \\epsilon)\\) of\ntheir probability concentrated in a a region of size smaller than\n\\(\\delta\\), for any choice of \\(\\epsilon, \\delta >0\\). This means,\nin our view, that relation\n (9)\n actually fails to express what most physicists would take to be the\nvery core idea of the uncertainty principle.\n\nOne way to deal with this objection is to consider alternative\nmeasures to quantify the spread or uncertainty associated with a\nprobability density. Here we discuss two such proposals.\n",
