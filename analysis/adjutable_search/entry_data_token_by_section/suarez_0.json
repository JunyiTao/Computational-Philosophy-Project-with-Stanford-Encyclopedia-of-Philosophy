    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\nFrancisco Su\u00e1rez was born in Granada on 5 January 1548, the son\nof Gaspar Su\u00e1rez de Toledo and Antonia V\u00e1zquez de Utiel.\nHe made a famously slow start. Thus, for example, his application to\njoin the Society of Jesus at the age of sixteen was the only one of\nfifty to be rejected: his health was weak and his intellect seemed\nunpromising. After appeal, he was finally admitted to the novitiate,\nbut only as a lowly ranked indiferente\u2014someone whose\npermanent rank within the Society would be determined at a later date.\nEven after being admitted, it took some time\u2014and some\npraying\u2014before Su\u00e1rez's talent for philosophy and\ntheology began to emerge. Eventually, however, they emerged as fully\nand undeniably apparent, and he rose to a position of great\nprofessional and academic\n prominence.[2]\n\nSu\u00e1rez's intellectual landscape was marked by the revival of\nIberian scholasticism, triggered in part by Francisco de Vitoria. His\nworks should therefore, in the first instance, be read as\ncontributions to this far-reaching theological and philosophical\nmovement and research program. The revival was very widespread,\nengaging dozens, if not hundreds, of theologians, not only across\nEurope and in the centers of learning and universities of Iberian\nAmerica (such as Lima, Quito, and Mexico), but as distant from the\nIberian peninsula as Japan, China, the Philippines, India and\nEthiopia. In all these lands philosophically minded missionaries,\nmainly Jesuits, promulgated his\n works.[3]\n Consider as an illustration that the Jesuit missionary Martino\nMartini, based at Hangzhou, even attempted a Chinese translation of\nSu\u00e1rez's great masterpiece, the Metaphysical\nDisputations, in the mid-seventeenth\n century.[4]\n\nSu\u00e1rez was thoroughly educated within the framework of this\nrevival, receiving two years of philosophy and four of theology,\nbefore he himself started teaching at the Jesuit School in Segovia.\nThis first appointment was followed by positions at Avila, Valladolid,\nAlcal\u00e1, Salamanca, the Jesuit School at Rome (the Collegio\nRomano), and, for almost twenty years, at Coimbra, in Portugal. While\nan unsuccessful preacher (his few attempts failed because of his\ntendency to digress into the abstruse points of doctrine, the\nsubtleties of which tended to be lost on his auditors), Su\u00e1rez\nproved to be a dedicated and original teacher, if not always a popular\none. His method departed from the norm: instead of merely repeating\nthe opinions of others, he believed in taking a fresh look at the\nissue under consideration, examining, as he used to say, the very root\nof the problem (Scorraille 2005: I, 156).\n\nLike many of his fellow Jesuits, Su\u00e1rez was frequently accused\nof straying too far and too often from views attributed to Thomas\nAquinas. During Su\u00e1rez's own lifetime and shortly after,\nallusions to a \u201cSuarista\u201d party (here in opposition to the\nThomists) became popular. Su\u00e1rez himself resisted these\ndistinctions as false and as resting on fabricated oppositions. He\ndenied being any sort of \u201cinventor of a new school\u201d or as\n\u201cin opposition to or creating a faction against anybody\u201d\n(Scorraille 2005: I, 310). He also faced opposition within his own\norder, in particular, from the other great theologian of his time,\nGabriel V\u00e1zquez\u2014an opposition which developed into a\nlife-long rivalry and a partisanship which survived their deaths.\n\nBeyond authoring works of highly abstract metaphysics and\nphilosophical theology, Su\u00e1rez wrote a number of polemical\ntracts motivated by the political upheavals of his day. In De\nimmunitate ecclesiastica, written in 1606, he defended\necclesiastical rights against alleged encroachments by the Republic of\nVenice. In Defensio fidei, published in 1613 at the behest of\nthe papal nuncio in Madrid, Decio Caraffa, he offered a response to\nJames I of England's defence of his requirement that Catholic subjects\ntake an oath of fidelity. This work went beyond its original purpose,\nto the point where it provided something close to a full-fledged\ntheory of political power. Seen as undermining the foundations of\nregal absolute rule, it was publicly burned, not only in London at the\nend of 1613, but also the following year in the courtyard of the\nParliament in Paris.\n\nThese unhappy events, though, came towards the end of Su\u00e1rez's\nlife, the last two decades of which were spent in the more peaceful\nsurroundings of Coimbra, then an intellectual hub of the\nrevitalization of scholastic philosophy. Philip II of Spain (Philip I\nof Portugal), who imposed his rule on the whole of the Iberian\npeninsula in 1580, sought to appoint a distinguished theologian to the\nmost eminent university of this new part of the realm. After initially\naccepting Su\u00e1rez's personally tendered apologies, given on\ngrounds of ill-health, Philip reconsidered and then insisted in a\nsecond letter that Su\u00e1rez take up a post in Coimbra. Clearly,\nSu\u00e1rez could not decline. Travels apart, Su\u00e1rez would\nremain in Coimbra until shortly before his death on 25 September 1617,\naged almost seventy, after convalescing for two weeks in Lisbon from\nwhat may have been dysentery.\n\nDuring his working life, Su\u00e1rez was both remarkably prolific\nand industrious (according to Fichter 1940: 327, he wrote about 21\nmillion words, more than twice the output of Thomas Aquinas), not only\nwriting but equally involving himself in all manner of editorial\nmatters. Given his eminence and popularity, almost as soon as\nSu\u00e1rez published a book, unauthorized copies were printed in\nplaces such as Paris, Vienna, Cologne, Geneva, Lyons, and Mainz.\n\nTwenty-two volumes of Su\u00e1rez's works were published, nine of\nthem posthumously under the care of his friend Baltasar Alvarez.\nWithin this corpus most of the philosophical interest has gone to the\nmonumental Disputationes metaphysicae (Metaphysical\nDisputations, 1597), a work in which Su\u00e1rez collects and\nthoughtfully assesses the views of numerous authors, on a vast array\nof problems, before offering his own solutions; De legibus\n(1612), where he outlines his natural law theory; and De\nanima (1621), where he offers a critical exposition of\nAristotelian approaches to life and cognition.\n\nA number of writings have been lost, including his commentaries on\nAristotle, which Su\u00e1rez had used for his classroom\npresentations during his first tenure at Salamanca. His oeuvre has\nbeen collected, most recently in the 28 volumes (including indexes),\nand published in Paris between 1856 and 1878 (Opera omnia).\nWe also have a collection of responsa (Conselhos e\nPareceres).\n",
