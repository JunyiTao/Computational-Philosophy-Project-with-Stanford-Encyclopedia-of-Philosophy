    "main_text": "What is altruism? || Well-Being and perfection\n1.4 Well-Being and perfection\n\nAs noted above, altruistic acts are guided by assumptions made by the\nagent about the well-being of some other individual or group. What\nwell-being consists in is a disputed matter, but it is uncontroversial\nthat a distinction must be drawn between (i) what constitutes\nwell-being and (ii) what is a necessary means towards or a\npre-condition of well-being. This kind of distinction is familiar, and\nis applicable in all sorts of cases. For example, we distinguish\nbetween what a breakfast consists in (cereal, juice, coffee) and the\nthings one needs in order to eat breakfast (spoons, glasses, mugs).\nThere is no such thing as eating breakfast but not eating anything\nthat breakfast consists in. In the same way, well-being must be sought\nand fostered by seeking and fostering the good or goods in which\nwell-being consists. Rival theories of well-being are competing ways\nof answering the question: what are its constituents? After we have\nanswered that question, we need to address the further question of how\nbest to obtain those constituents. (Contemporary discussions of\nwell-being can be found in Badhwar 2014; Feldman 1994, 2010; Fletcher\n2016; Griffin 1986; Kraut 2007; Sumner 1996 Tiberius 2018.)\n\nWell-being admits of degrees: the more one has of the good or goods in\nwhich it consists, the better off one is. It would be an awkward\nmanner of speaking to say of someone: \u201cshe has well-being\u201d.\nA more natural way to express that idea would be to use such terms as\nthese: \u201cshe is faring well\u201d, \u201cshe is well off\u201d,\n\u201cshe is flourishing\u201d, \u201cher life is going well for\nher\u201d. The constituents of well-being can also be spoken of as\nbenefits or advantages\u2014but when one uses these terms to refer to\nwell-being, one must recognize that these benefits or advantages are\nconstituents of well-being, and not merely of instrumental value.\nBenefits and advantages, in other words, fall into two categories:\nthose that are good for someone merely because they foster other\ngoods, and those that are good for someone in that they are\nconstituents of that individual\u2019s well-being.\n\nA distinction must be drawn between being good at something\nand having what is good for oneself. It is one thing to say,\n\u201che is good at acting\u201d and another to say \u201cacting is\ngood for him\u201d. Philosophers speak of the former as\n\u201cperfectionist value\u201d and the latter as \u201cprudential\nvalue\u201d. That is because when one tries to be good at something,\none hopes to move closer to the ideal of perfection. Prudential value\nis the kind of good that it would be in someone\u2019s interest to\nobtain\u2014it is another term that belongs to the group we have been\ndiscussing: \u201cwell-being\u201d, \u201cwelfare\u201d,\n\u201cbenefit\u201d, and so on.\n\nEven though perfectionist and prudential value must be distinguished,\nit should not be inferred that that being good at something is not a\nconstituent of well-being. To return to the example used in the\npreceding paragraph: if someone has great talent as an actor and\nenjoys acting and every aspect of theatrical life, it is plausible to\nsay that his well-being consists, at least to some extent, in his\nenjoyment of these activities. There are two different facts in play\nhere: (i) he is an excellent actor, and (ii) being an excellent actor\nis good for him (not as a mere means, but as a component of his\nwell-being). The value referred to in (i) is perfectionist value, and\nin (ii) prudential value. It would be prudent of him, in other words,\nto continue to excel as an actor.\n\nThese points about well-being and excellence are pertinent to a study\nof altruism because they help guard against a too narrow conception of\nthe sorts of goods that an altruist might promote in others. Altruists\ndo not aim only at the relief of suffering or the avoidance of\nharm\u2014they also try to provide positive benefits to others for\ntheir sake. What counts as a benefit depends on what the correct\ntheory of well-being is, but it is widely and plausibly assumed that\ncertain kinds of excellence are components of a good life. For\nexample, someone who founds a school that trains children to excel in\nthe arts and sciences, or in sports, simply so that they will enjoy\nexercising such skills, would be regarded as a great public benefactor\nand philanthropist. Similarly, teachers and parents who foster in\ntheir students and children a love of literature and the skills needed\nto appreciate it would be viewed as altruists, if they are motivated\nby the thought that by themselves these activities are benefits to\nthose students and children.\n\nHowever, it is possible for someone to be dedicated to excellence and\nat the same time to be utterly indifferent to human\nwell-being\u2014and when this happens, we have no inclination to say\nthat such a person is motivated by altruism. Someone might be devoted\nto a subject\u2014mathematics, or philosophy, or\nliterature\u2014rather than to the well-being of those who study and\nmaster that subject. For example, imagine a student of literature who\ncares deeply about James Joyce\u2019s Ulysses, because he\ntakes it to be one of the supreme achievements of the human mind. He\ndoes not want that novel merely to gather dust on library\nshelves\u2014it deserves readers who love and understand it, and so\nthe skills needed to appreciate it must be kept alive from one\ngeneration to another. This kind of devotion to perfectionist value is\nnot a form of altruism.\n\nFor an act to be altruistically motivated is for the\nbenefactor\u2014not the beneficiary\u2014to have a certain\nattitude towards it. A child who acquires from a tennis instructor the\nskills of a good athlete and a love of the game may simply think of\ntennis as great fun\u2014not as something that benefits him or as a\nconstituent of his life going well. The child does not need to\npractice his skills because he believes that doing so is good for him:\nthat is not a necessary condition of his being the beneficiary of an\naltruistic act. Similarly, someone might deny that physical suffering\ncounts as something that is bad for him. (He should deny this,\naccording to the Stoics.) But on any plausible theory of well-being,\nhe is wrong about that; someone who aims to diminish the pain of\nanother individual, out of a concern for that individual\u2019s\nwell-being, is acting altruistically. \n\nTo take another example, consider someone who develops a love of\nphilosophy and immerses herself in the subject. When she asks herself\nwhether she is doing this for her own good, she may reply that her\nreasons are quite different. She may say, \u201cphilosophy is\nworthwhile in itself\u201d. Or: \u201cI want to solve the mind-body\nproblem and the free will problem because these are deep and important\nissues\u201d. If we suggested to her that her philosophical struggles\nare a component of her well-being, she might regard that as a strange\nway of looking at things. But her view is not\nauthoritative\u2014whether she is right depends on what the best\ntheory of well-being is. Others who care about her could plausibly\nbelieve that her love of philosophy is a component of her well-being,\nbecause it constitutes an enrichment and deepening of her mind, which is of value to her in itself, whether or not it leads to some further result. If they help her pursue her\nphilosophical interests simply for her sake, their motives would be\naltruistic, even if she herself does not care about philosophy because\nshe thinks it is good for her.\n",
