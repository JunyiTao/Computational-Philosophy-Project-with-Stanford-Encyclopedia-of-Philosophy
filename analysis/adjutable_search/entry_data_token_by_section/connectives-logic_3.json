Selected Existence Questions\n4.1 Conditions not Corresponding to Rules (Example 1)\n\nFor conditions other than those corresponding to (closure under\ncertain) rules we can also ask whether a connective satisfying the\ncondition in question can safely\u2014i.e. conservatively\u2014be\npostulated to exist. One such condition is the following, here\nexpressed as a condition on a consequence relation \u22a2 with a\nbinary connective # in its language, all variables understood as\nuniversally quantified:\n\n\u0393 \u22a2 \u03c6 # \u03c8 if and only if \u0393 \u22a2 \u03c6 or\n\u0393 \u22a2 \u03c8.\n\n\nIt is because of the \u201cor\u201d on the right that this\ncondition\u2014more precisely, its \u2018only if\u2019\nhalf\u2014does not correspond to a sequent-to-sequent rule. Still we\ncan ask whether some Set-Fmla\nproof system including the rule (\u2228E) (or the\nsequent calculus rule (\u2228 Left)), e.g. for classical logic, has a\nconservative extension to a proof system for a language with the\nadditional connective #, whose associated consequence relation\nsatisfies the above condition for this\n #.[38]\n To see that the answer to this question is negative, note that the\nbinary relation R\u22a2 defined in terms of the\n#-supporting extension \u22a2:\nR\u22a2(\u03c6,\u03c8) iff \u03c6 \u22a2 \u03c8,\ngives rise to a binary relational connection (L, L,\nR\u22a2) which provides conjunctive\n(yes\u2014conjunctive) combinations on the left, since\n\u22a2 is \u2228-classical, \u03c6 \u22c5L \u03c8\nhere being \u03c6 \u2228 \u03c8, while the inset condition above (take\n\u0393 = {\u03c7}) secures disjunctive objects on the right, with\n\u03c6 +R \u03c8 being \u03c6 # \u03c8.\n(\u201cL\u201d and \u201cR\u201d subscripts from\nSection\n 1\n restored here to prevent confusion, since the source and target\ncoincide.) Thus the crossover condition from Section\n 1\n is satisfied, which says that if \u03c61 \u22a2\n\u03c81 and \u03c62 \u22a2 \u03c82 then\neither \u03c61 \u22a2 \u03c82 or\n\u03c62 \u22a2 \u03c81. Taking \u03c61\n= \u03c81 = \u03c7 and \u03c62 = \u03c82\n= \u03c7\u2032, we have the antecedent of this conditional (by (Id)),\nso we conclude that for all formulas \u03c7, \u03c7\u2032, either \u03c7\n\u22a2 \u03c7\u2032 or \u03c7\u2032 \u22a2 \u03c7, which includes\n#-free formulas of the original language (e.g., \u03c7 = p,\n\u03c7\u2032 = q) for which neither is a consequence of the\nother by the original consequence relation, showing any proposed\nextension along the above lines to be non-conservative.\n4.2 Pollard-Style Nonconservativity (Example 2)\n\nThis is really a whole range of examples. As we required (\u2228E) for\nExample 1, here we require (\u2192I). Let us call a consequence\nrelation \u22a2 \u2192-introductive if \u0393, \u03c6\n\u22a2 \u03c8 always implies \u0393 \u22a2 \u03c6 \u2192\n \u03c8.[39]\n Now suppose \u22a2 \u2287 \u22a2I\u2009L and\n\u22a2 is \u2192-introductive, and either (i) for some n-ary\nconnective #, \u22a2 satisfies the conditions induced (on consequence\nrelations) by the determinant \u27e8F,\u2026, F,T\u27e9 (n\noccurrences of \u201cF\u201d) for #, as well as some determinant\nwith F as its final entry, or (ii) \u22a2 satisfies the conditions\ninduced by the determinant \u27e8T,\u2026,T, F\u27e9 (n\noccurrences of \u201cT\u201d) as well as some determinant with T as\nfinal entry (for n-ary #). Then it follows that \u22a2\n\u2287 \u22a2CL.\n\nThe implication from (i) to the conclusion that \u22a2 \u2287\n\u22a2CL has been stressed in several publications\nby S. Pollard (Pollard 2002, Pollard and Martin 1996); there is a\nsimilar proof for the implication from (ii). Neither proof is given\nhere\u2014only an illustration (of case (ii)). The truth-function\nknown as exclusive disjunction (or xor), which differs from\nthat associated on Boolean valuations with \u2228 (\u201cinclusive\ndisjunction\u201d) by having \u27e8T, T, F\u27e9 instead of the\ndeterminant \u27e8T, T, T\u27e9, will serve as an example, since as\nwell as the determinant just mentioned, which has T\u2019s except for\nthe final F, we have a T-final determinant (e.g.) \u27e8T, F, T\u27e9.\nThe induced conditions on generalized consequence relations for these\ntwo determinants are respectively:\n\n\n\n \u03c6, \u03c8, \u03c6 # \u03c8 \u22a9 \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n \u03c6 \u22a9 \u03c8, \u03c6 # \u03c8.  \n\n\n\nFor the following, we will take it that, as well as \u2192, the\nconnectives \u2228, \u00ac, \u22a4 and \u22a5 are available, though in\nfact the result just given requires is correct for any fragment with\n\u2192 (with \u22a2CL understood as the restriction\nof the classical consequence relation to the fragment in question).\nThen we can write the induced conditions on our consequence relation\n\u22a2 as, respectively, rather than using a new schematic letter on\nthe right for the first, and converting the second into conditional\nform:\n\n\n\n \u03c6, \u03c8, \u03c6 # \u03c8 \u22a2 \u22a5 \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n \u03c6 \u22a2 \u03c8 \u2228 (\u03c6 # \u03c8).  \n\n\n\nNow making use of the hypothesis that \u22a2 is\n\u2192-introductive\u2014which does not follow from the fact\nthat \u22a2I\u2009L is \u2192-introductive and\n\u22a2 \u2287 \u22a2I\u2009L\u2014the first\ncondition now allows for successive rewriting, first as\n\n\u03c6 # \u03c8 \u22a2 \u03c6 \u2192 (\u03c8 \u2192 \u22a5),\n\n\nand then as\n\n\u03c6 # \u03c8 \u22a2 \u03c6 \u2192 \u00ac\u03c8.\n\n\nThe fact that \u22a2 is an \u2192-introductive extension of\n\u22a2I\u2009L suffices for \u22a2 to be\n\u2228-classical, and in particular for it to be\n\u2018\u2228-eliminative\u2019 in the sense that whenever \u0393\n\u22a2 \u03c71 \u2228 \u03c72 and also\n\u0393\u2032, \u03c71 \u22a2 \u03b8 and\n\u0393\u2032\u2032, \u03c72 \u22a2 \u03b8, we have\n\u0393, \u0393\u2032, \u0393\u2032\u2032 \u22a2 \u03b8. Thus\nfrom the fact that \u03c6 \u22a2 \u03c8 \u2228 (\u03c6 # \u03c8), inset on\nthe right above, and that \u03c6 # \u03c8 \u22a2 \u03c6 \u2192\n\u00ac\u03c8, we may conclude that \u03c6 \u22a2 \u03c8\n\u2228 (\u03c6 \u2192 \u00ac\u03c8). Not only does this\nfail\u2014e.g., with the schematic letters replaced by distinct\npropositional variables\u2014for \u22a2I\u2009L,\nmaking the extension non-conservative, it takes us all the way to\n\u22a2CL, as claimed in the general formulation\n((i) and (ii)) of the result. To see this most easily in the present\ncase, take \u03c6 as \u22a4.\n\nDoes any of this mean that there is a problem in finding an\nintuitionistic analogue of exclusive disjunction? Not at all. There\nare many derived binary connectives all of which form compounds\nequivalent in classical logic to the exclusive disjunction of \u03c6\nwith \u03c8 and which are in the interesting cases not equivalent to\neach other intuitionistically\u2014for example, \u03c6 \u2194\n\u00ac\u03c8 and \u00ac(\u03c6 \u2194 \u03c8) and (\u03c6 \u2228 \u03c8) \u2227\n\u00ac(\u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8). As it happens, the third of these (which is\nIL-equivalent to (\u03c6 \u2227 \u00ac\u03c8) \u2228 (\u00ac\n\u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8)) has an especially close relationship with\nthe truth-function of exclusive disjunction, like that between\nintuitionistic \u00ac and the negation truth-function, which can be\nexplained in terms of the Kripke semantics for intuitionistic logic\n(not explained in this entry) by saying that the compound in question\nis true at a point just in case at every accessible point it is true\nwhen evaluated by using the corresponding boolean function and the\ntruth-values of the components at that\n point.[40]\n Note that the negation truth-function itself has its\ndeterminant-induced conditions rules dangerous to the health of\nintuitionistic logic under both (i) and (ii) of the result at the\nstart of this example: no single connective can conservatively form\nfrom a formula a contrary of that formula (as \u27e8T,\nF\u27e9 demands) and also a subcontrary of\nthat formula (as \u27e8F, T\u27e9 demands). As it is often put,\nstandard intuitionistic negation (\u00ac) forms the deductively weakest\ncontrary of a formula, while dual intuitionistic negation (mentioned\nonly in passing in this entry) forms its deductively strongest\n subcontrary.[41]\n4.3 Negation by Iteration (Example 3)\n\nCould there be a 1-ary connective # two successive applications of\nwhich amounted to a single application of (say) classical\n negation?[42]\n If we work in Set-Set\nan austere version of this question amounts to asking about the fate\nof # subjected, alongside the standard structural rules, to the\ncondition that for all \u03c6:\n\n\n\n \u03c6, ##\u03c6 \u227b \n \u00a0and\u00a0 \n \u227b \u03c6, ##\u03c6  \n\n\n\nshould both be provable, to which it is natural to add immediately\nthat # should be congruential according to the generalized consequence\nrelation associated with this proof system. Without the latter\naddition, we could just think of \u201c##\u201d as an\nidiosyncratically long-winded way of writing \u201c\u00ac\u201d. With\nit, we are insisting that a single occurrence of \u201c#\u201d is\ngenuinely responsive to the content of what it applies to. It is not\nhard to see that there is no (two-valued) truth-functional\ninterpretation available for #, not just in the weak sense that it\nmight be said that (for example) \u2610 in S4 does not admit\nof such an interpretation\u2014that this logic is determined by (\n= both sound and complete with respect to) no\nclass of valuations over which \u2610 is truth-functional\u2014but\nin the stronger sense that the envisaged logic of # is not even\nsound with respect to such a class of valuations, at least if\nthat class is non-constant in the sense defined at the end of\nnote 20.[43]\n In the paper cited, this congruential logic of what is there and in\nan earlier paper there referred to as demi-negation is discussed and\nequipped with a Kripke-style semantics (essentially re-working an\nearlier 4-valued matrix semantics) the upshot of which is that\nclassical propositional logic or any fragment thereof is\nconservatively extended by the two zero-premiss rules inset\nabove\u2014or alternatively, assuming \u00ac is in the fragment, by\nthe equivalence of \u00ac\u03c6 and ##\u03c6\u2014and a congruentiality\nrule for #. Nevertheless it is hard to imagine, \u201cfrom the\ninside\u201d, speaking a language with a connective for which this\nprovided a suitable formal treatment. The description suggested at p.\n257 of Dalla Chiara, Giuntini, and Greechie (2004), a study in quantum\nlogic, of such a connective as expressing a kind of tentative\nnegation, seems wrong, since iterating tentative negation would not\nproduce (untentative) negation: If you tentatively negate the\ntentative negation of \u03c6 you would appear to be headed (however\ntentatively) back in the direction of \u03c6 rather than towards \u00ac\n\u03c6. On the same page of Dalla Chiara et al. (2004),\nDeutsch et al. (2000) are approvingly quoted as saying the\nfollowing\u2014in which, since composition is more like\nmultiplication than addition, demi-negation is referred to as the\n\u2018square root\u2019 of negation:\n\nLogicians are now entitled to propose a new logical operation\n\u221anot. Why? Because a faithful physical model for it\nexists in nature.\n\n\nI do not recall logicians having to seek the blessing of physicists\nbefore pursuing this or that line of inquiry, or of the interest,\nsignificance or legitimacy (\u201cnow entitled to propose...\u201d,\nno less) of such inquiries being dependent on empirical and\ntheoretical findings in physics, when what is under investigation is\nmost naturally taken to be an a priori matter: the coherence\nof a connective with given inferential properties. This is not at all\nto deny that the \u2018quantum machines\u2019 described in Deutsch\net al. (2000) (or Chiara, Giuntini, and Greechie 2004,\n257\u2013259) may help us get a feel for the connective in\n question.[44]\n4.4 Logical Subtraction (Example 4)\n\nSuppose one wants to say more about the weather than that it rained on\na particular Saturday. One wants to strengthen one\u2019s commitments\nso that they include not only rain on Saturday but also rain on the\nfollowing Sunday. With \u2227 (assuming some background \u2227-classical\nconsequence relation) there is nothing easier. Abbreviating \u201cIt\nrained on the Saturday in question\u201d to Sat and\n\u201cIt rained on Sunday\u201d to Sun, one can convert\none\u2019s original statement into one making the stronger claim by\npassing from Sat to Sat \u2227 Sun. Now\nsuppose one wanted a similar device but working in the reverse\ndirection. One starts with a claim whose content is given by Sat\n\u2227 Sun and wants to modify this using a connective\nwhich removes commitments in much the way that \u2227 adds them, and\nusing this connective, often called logical subtraction\n(though a case could be made for \u2018logical division\u2019 in\nview of the usual association of conjunction with multiplication), one\nwants to take away the commitment to rain on Sunday, leaving only the\noriginal claim. That is, one would like a connective added to the\nlanguage of one\u2019s favoured consequence relation, in such a way\nthat the added connective was governed by rules making the extension\nconservative, but for which one had the equivalence (writing \u22a2)\nfor the extended consequence relation:\n\n(Sat \u2227 Sun) \u2212  Sun\n\u22a3\u22a2 Sat.\n\n\nAn early and plausible suggestion for the treatment of logical\nsubtraction was made in Hudson (1975). According to this suggestion,\nno new connective is required, at least if we already have a\nreasonable implication connective at our disposal, because if we are\nto think of \u03c6 \u2212 \u03c8 as giving us\nthe result of taking away the content of \u03c8 from that of \u03c6,\nthen this should be the weakest statement which, together with \u03c8,\nhas \u03c6 as a consequence. But this is just \u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6, if\nthe standard natural deduction rules for \u2192 from Section\n 2\n are accepted (as in intuitionistic and classical logic). Yet this\ndoes not give us the inset equivalence above. If we treat\n(Sat \u2227 Sun) \u2212 Sun as Sun\n\u2192 (Sat \u2227 Sun), then this is equivalent (in\nthe logics just mentioned and many others) to Sun \u2192 \nSat, whereas we wanted the stronger Sat itself (stronger\naccording to those logics, again).\n\nThe example above used an interpreted language with atomic sentences\nSat and Sun. The inset equivalence presented\ninvolving them would not be reasonable for all sentences. Modulating\nback to the issue of a formal propositional logic involving the\nenvisaged new connective, such an equivalence would not be reasonable\nfor arbitrary \u03c6 and \u03c8 in place of them, since we would expect\nthe new connective to be congruential according to the desired\nconsequence relation, and any unrestricted such equivalence would then\ndeliver from \u03c61 \u2227 \u03c8 \u22a3\u22a2\n\u03c62 \u2227 \u03c8\u2014by \u201csubtracting \u03c8 from\nboth sides\u201d (in view of congruentiality)\u2014the conclusion\nthat \u03c61 \u22a3\u22a2 \u03c62, and it easy\nto find counterexamples to such cancellation inferences for even quite\nweak initial logics. Since the counterexamples arise for\n\u03c61, \u03c62, in the language unexpanded by\n\u201c\u2212\u201d, the sense in which a generalized version of the\nearlier equivalence would not be reasonable is that it would not be\nconservative over the initial logic. Here we say no more about how to\nconstrain the equivalence in question, or, more generally, about\nwhether there really is any such logical subtraction connective as\nwe have been\n envisaging.[45]\n4.5 A Multiple Existence Question (Example 5)\n\nA much more straightforward example, this time considering several\nconnectives at once. Suppose we ask whether one can conservatively add\nto intuitionistic logic three binary connectives #1,\n#2, #3, satisfying for all \u03c6, \u03c8:\n\n\n\n \u03c6 \u22a3\u22a2 (\u03c6 #1 \u03c8) \u2192 (\u03c6\n#3 \u03c8) \n \u00a0and\u00a0 \n \u03c8 \u22a3\u22a2 (\u03c6 #2 \u03c8) \u2192 (\u03c6\n#3 \u03c8).  \n\n\n\nIn classical logic we can take \u03c6 #1 \u03c8 and \u03c6\n#2 \u03c8 as (equivalent to) \u00ac\u03c6 and \u00ac\u03c8\nrespectively, and \u03c6 #3 \u03c8 as \u22a5. There are no\nthree candidates playing the desired role in any conservative\nextension of intuitionistic logic, however, because the inset\nequivalences render arbitrary \u03c6 and \u03c8 head-linked in the sense\nof Section\n 3,\n with \u03c6 #3 \u03c8 as the head formula.\n4.6 An Example Related to Algebraizability (Example 6)\n\nThe present example comes from the relevant logic R. The\nsentential constants T and t whose sequent calculus\ntreatment we saw in Section\n 3\n are treated in axiomatic developments of R by means of the\naxiom schemas \u03c6 \u2192 T for the former cases and both\nt and t \u2192 (\u03c6 \u2192 \u03c6), though these\nlast two can be replaced by \u03c6 \u2194 (t \u2192 \u03c6).\nHere \u2194 itself can be regarded as an abbreviation either of (\u03c6\n\u2192 \u03c8) \u2227 (\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6), or as (\u03c6\n\u2192 \u03c8) \u25cb (\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6),\nwhere \u2227 and \u25cb are the additive or \u2018extensional\u2019\n(as the relevance tradition would have it) conjunction and the\nmultiplicative or \u2018intensional\u2019 conjunction (also called\nfusion) respectively. While in linear logic neither\np \u25cb q nor p \u2227 q provably\nimplies the other, in R, thanks to the presence of contraction,\nthe latter implies the\n former.[46]\n A well-known further side effect of contraction is that \u03c6 \u25cb\n\u03c8 and \u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8 are also equivalent whenever \u03c6 is an\nimplicational formula and \u03c8 is its converse, so the two\nalternative readings of \u03c6 \u2194 \u03c8 above are equivalent in\nR. Now consider the possible existence of a new nullary\nconnective for R in the \u2018truth constants\u2019 family,\nT, subject to the axiom schema:\n\n\u03c6 \u2194 (T \u2194 \u03c6).\n\n\nThis looks harmless enough, the principles governing t,\nT and T all holding for the\nundifferentiated \u22a4 constant of classical and intuitionistic\nlogic, but here notationally distinguished so as not to prejudice\nquestions of the logical relations between\n them.[47]\n\nBut in R, this harmless appearance is deceptive. For in this\nlogic the connective \u2194 is what we have called special.\nAfter the well-known extension, R-Mingle or RM, of\nR by the Mingle schema \u03c6 \u2192 (\u03c6\n\u2192\n \u03c6),[48]\n let us call a formula \u03c6 for which this is already provable in\nR a Mingler. Since RM is a proper extension of\nR, not all formulas are Minglers in R. But again thanks\nto contraction, all \u2194-formulas are Minglers, rendering \u2194\nspecial in R. Now we can see that the addition of T,\nsubject to the schema inset above, would\nextend R non-conservatively because now every formula \u03c6\nwould be equivalent to the corresponding \u2194-formula T\n\u2194 \u03c6, so even for T-free\n\u03c6 we should have the Mingle theorem\n\u03c6 \u2192 (\u03c6 \u2192 \u03c6). Thus no devotee of R should\nbe prepared to countenance the existence of T\nbehaving as envisaged (or indeed any pair\n#1, #2 of 1-ary connectives with \u03c6 provably\nequivalent to #1\u03c6 \u2194 #2\u03c6).\n\nThe fact that the biconditional connective is special in R may\nappear to conflict with the fact, established in Blok and Pigozzi\n(1989) that this logic is what the authors call\nalgebraizable. This term is applied to consequence relations\n\u22a2 which are translationally equivalent to the quasi-equational\nconsequence relation \u22a8K of a class of algebras\nof the same similarity type as the language of \u22a2. That is, for\nequations\ne1,\u2026,en, we\nhave\ne1,\u2026,en\u22121\u22a8K\nen just in case for any algebra A\n\u2208 K and any assignment of elements of A to the\nvariables in the ei, if all of\ne1,\u2026,en\u22121\ncome out true in A on that assignment, so does\nen. The translational equivalence idea\nmeans that there is a translation \u03c4 from formulas of the\n(sentential) language of \u22a2 to equations of the language of\nK, and a translation \u03c4\u2032 back in the other direction,\nwhich are mutually inverse in the sense that \u03c6 \u22a3\u22a2\n\u03c4\u2032(\u03c4(\u03c6)) and e\n\u2ae4\u22a8K \u03c4(\u03c4\u2032(e)) for\nall formulas \u03c6 and equations e, and, for all formulas\n\u03c61,\u2026,\u03c6n and equations\ne1,\u2026,en,\neither of the following conditions is satisfied (from which it follows\nthat both are):\n\n\u03c61,\u2026,\u03c6n\u22121 \u22a2\n\u03c6n if and only if\n\u03c4(\u03c61),\u2026,\u03c4(\u03c6n\u22121)\n\u22a8K \u03c4(\u03c6n)\n\n\nand\n\ne1,\u2026,en\u22121\n\u22a8K en if and only\nif\n\u03c4\u2032(e1),\u2026,\u03c4\u2032(en\u22121)\n\u22a2 \u03c4\u2032(en).\n\n\nThis account of algebraizability has been oversimplified for\nexpository purposes in one respect: Blok and Pigozzi (1989) do not\nrequire the translation of a formula (what we are calling \u03c4)\nshould yield a single equation, but allow a set of equations,\nand similarly in the converse direction, \u03c4\u2032(e) is\nallowed to be a set of formulas. It follows from the present\ndefinition, with the single equation/single formula restriction\nremoved, that the formulas in the latter set function collectively as\nan equivalence-like compound satisfying some further congruence\nconditions, which in the case of \u22a2R can be\ntaken to be \u2194. Accordingly, the fact that\n\u22a2R\u2014explained presently\u2014is\nalgebraizable, entails, in view of the \u201c\u03c6 \u22a3\u22a2\n\u03c4\u2032(\u03c4(\u03c6))\u201d condition, that, loosely speaking,\nevery formula is equivalent to an equivalence. But does this not clash\nwith our finding that \u2194 is special in R?\n\nWell, first, the consequence relation \u22a2R needs\nto be explained. Blok and Pigozzi have in mind the least consequence\nrelation for which \u03c6, \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c8 \u22a2\n\u03c8 and \u03c6, \u03c8\u22a2 \u03c6 \u2227\n\u03c8 and \u22a2\u00a0\u03c6 for all \u03c6 provable in the\nFmla logic R. (This third condition can\nbe restricted to all axioms of any axiomatization of R with\nformula-to-formula rules corresponding to the first and second\nconditions.) Now the loose summary just given to the effect that every\nformula is equivalent to an equivalence makes a misleading double use\nof the equivalence vocabulary for two different things: equivalence as\nmutual consequence (\u201c\u22a3\u22a2\u201d) and equivalence as\nthe biconditional connective. Removing the conflation, it means that\nfor every \u03c6 there exist \u03c8, \u03c7, with \u03c6\n\u22a3\u22a2R\u03c8 \u2194\n \u03c7.[49]\n This is a very different matter from having\n\u22a2R\u03c6 \u2194(\u03c8 \u2194 \u03c7). The latter\nwould indeed be equivalent to the provability in the sequent calculus\ndescribed for R in Section\n 3\n of \u03c6 \u227b \u03c8 \u2194 \u03c7 and the converse sequent. But the\napparently matching \u22a2R-statements mean\nsomething very different, building in the structural features (such as\nweakening) that the substructural sequent calculus was designed to\navoid. Note in particular that \u22a2R is not\n\u2192-introductive, in the sense of Example 2 above.\n4.7 Two-Dimensional Isotopes of Boolean Connectives (Longer Example 7) \n\nCould there exist a connective #\u2032 which, when appearing outside\nof the scope of some specified range of operators \u2013 typically,\nnon-Boolean connectives \u2013 behaves just like a given Boolean\nconnective #, while behaving differently from # when occurring within\nthe scope of one of the operators in the range in question?\nUnderstanding all of this as happening under the aegis of some\nparticular consequence relation, on which more will be said in the\nfollowing paragraph, the situation envisaged would be like this. A\n#\u2032-compound would be equivalent to a #-compound of the same\ncomponents, each compound having the other as a consequence by the\nrelevant consequence relation, without being synonymous with that\ncompound (synonymy as explained in Section\n 1).\n The remainder of this example assumes some familiarity with the basic\nmodal logic of \u201cactually\u201d. The semantics of this logic can\nbe presented, as in the first two pages of Davies and Humberstone\n(1980), using models with a distinguished point (or world), with a\nformula A\u03c6 evaluated as true at any point in the model\njust in case \u03c6 is true at the distinguished point. The\ngenerally valid formulas are then those true every point in\nall such models, and the generally valid sequents are those for which\ntruth is preserved from left to right at each point in all such\nmodels. The real-world valid formulas (sequents) are those\nwhich are true (resp. truth-preserving) at the distinguished point in\nall models.\n\nAlternatively, the semantics can be reformulated so that the models\nfeature no such privileged point and truth (in a model) is relativized\nto a pair of points, one of which plays the \u2018real world\u2019\nrole formerly played by the distinguished element, the other playing\nthe role of the world of at which the formula is being locally\nevaluated, as in notes 4 and 16 of Davies and Humberstone (1980).\nGeneral validity is a matter of truth or its preservation relative to\narbitrary such pairs in all models, and diagonal validity (as\nreal-world validity is often suggestively called in this setting)\nattends instead only to pairs whose first and second coordinates\ncoincide. On either style of presentation, the formulation in terms of\nsequents gives a consequence relation in the obvious way, and for\npresent purposes the following terminology will be convenient.\nFormulas will be said to be diagonally equivalent when each\nis a consequence of the other by the consequence relation capturing\ndiagonal (or \u2018real-world\u2019) validity and to be\nunrestrictedly equivalent when this holds instead for the\ngeneral consequence relation. (We avoid the phrase \u201cgenerally\nequivalent\u201d, since it is hard not to hear this as meaning\n\u201cequivalent, for the most part\u201d; this terminology is\nadapted from the reference to general consequence on p.\u00a015 of\nFusco 2015 as unrestricted consequence.) The current distinction\nbetween diagonal and unrestricted equivalence provides a useful formal\nmodeling of Dummett\u2019s well-known distinction between sameness of\nassertive (or assertoric) content, on the one hand, and sameness of\ningredient sense on the\n other.[50]\n The idea of applying such a contrast to the case of specific pairs of\nconnectives \u2013 as with the #, #\u2032 pairs from the start of\nthe preceding paragraph \u2013 appears, however, to be new with Fusco\n(2015), to which we turn presently. The consequence relation in play\nin the #, #\u2032 discussion above is taken as the diagonal\nconsequence relation (with the associated relation of weak\nequivalence), according to which these connectives are\nnon-congruential, providing for mutual consequence without synonymy,\nrather than the finer-grained general consequence relation (associated\nwith unrestricted equivalence). The latter consequence relation is\ncongruential, but at the cost of not directly reflecting the felt\na priori equivalence of A\u03c6 with \u03c6.\n\nThe aspect of Fusco (2015) of present concern is the treatment of\ndisjunction, with special reference to the problems with which it is\nassociated in deontic logic \u2013 such as Ross\u2019s Paradox, and\nthe representation of Free Choice permission. The issue is discussed\nfurther in Section 3 of Fusco (2019). (For general background,\nincluding these problems, see McNamara 2019; more detail on the\nspecifically disjunction-related issues arising is provided in Aloni\n2016.) Fusco (2015) argues, on grounds we do not go into here (since\nthey involve several parts of an elaborate theory of deontic notions),\nthat these problems of deontically embedded \u201cor\u201d in\nEnglish (and corresponding vocabulary in other natural languages) are\nbest treated rendering it formally by means of \u201c or\n\u201d, with \u03c6 or\n\u03c8 defined as:\n\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(A(\u03c6 \u2227 \u00ac\u03c8) \u2192 \u03c6) \u2227\n(A(\u00ac\u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8) \u2192 \u03c8) \u2227\n(A(\u03c6 \u2194 \u03c8) \u2192 (\u03c6 \u2228 \u03c8)).\n\n\nThis is a suggested definition, at least for \u03c6, \u03c8, constructed\nusing just Boolean connectives, from a planned sequel to Fusco (2015)\nand (2019), spelling out in the object language a semantic\ncharacterization supplied in the first of those papers. An\nunrestrictedly equivalent definition (or more accurately, definiens)\nwhich some readers may prefer is the following:\n\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(A(\u03c6 \u2227 \u00ac\u03c8) \u2227 \u03c6) \u2228\n(A(\u00ac\u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8) \u2227 \u03c8) \u2228\n(A(\u03c6 \u2194 \u03c8) \u2227 (\u03c6 \u2228 \u03c8)).\n\n\nBy contrast, instances of the following schema, giving the treatment\nof \u201cwhether \u03c6 or \u03c8 \u201d in Lewis (1982) for Boolean\n\u03c6, \u03c8 (though not in general, as explained in the last\nparagraph of note 51 below), would only be diagonally equivalent to the\ncorresponding instances of the above pair:\n\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(A\u03c6 \u2227 \u03c6) \u2228 (A\u03c8 \u2227\n\u03c8).\n\n\nSo as to have concrete formulas to discuss, consider the instances of\nthese three schemata with distinct sentence letters p and\nq taken as \u03c6 and \u03c8, respectively, and we will now use\n(1)\u2013(3) to refer to these concrete instances. The first pair are\nunrestrictedly equivalent and all three are diagonally equivalent,\nwith (3) having (1) and (2) as general consequences though not\n conversely.[51]\n All are diagonally equivalent to the Boolean disjunction p\n\u2228 q, which we may put by saying that all are\ntwo-dimensional isotopes of the one-dimensional, i.e.\nA-free, formula p \u2228 q, or, more\nusefully, that their respective equivalence classes w.r.t. the\nrelation of unrestricted equivalence, stand in this\n\u2018isotope\u2019 relation. Similarly, we can speak of the (in the\nabove presentation, derived) connective or\nas a two-dimensional isotope of the Boolean \u2228,\nthinking of the formula (2) as a context of the variables p,\nq. (On the other hand, what is referred to in note 51  as Groenendijk\u2013Stokhof\u2019s \u201cor\u201d\nis not a two-dimensional isotope of\nBoolean disjunction, p\u00a0or\u00a0q,\nso understood, being diagonally\nequivalent to a Boolean tautology, rather than to\np\u00a0\u2228\u00a0q.)\n\nWhat is the point of considering such two-dimensional isotopes of\nBoolean disjunction? Fusco\u2019s idea is the following. Arguably,\npeople have thought that the correct treatment of inclusive\n\u201cor\u201d in English is given by (Boolean) \u201c\u2228\u201d,\nonce they have learned to diagnose as pragmatic distraction any\napparent anomalies, because this simple connective with its\ntruth-functional semantics captures the way \u201cor\u201d behaves\nwhen it appears unembedded (or only \u2018Booleanly\u2019 embedded).\nThe presumption has then been that any residual anomalies arising from\nproblematic embeddings will be eventually also then be explained away\npragmatically. But what if we had on our hands a two-dimensional\nisotope of \u2228 that was specially hand-crafted to deal with these\nanomalies, such as Fusco\u2019s or? The\nunembedded behaviour of \u2228 and or, in view\nof the diagonal equivalence of compounds formed using the two\ndisjunctions, would be the same, so or-disjunction\nwould have all the benefits of\nBoolean disjunction without the drawback of not faring very\nsatisfactorily when appearing in the scope of certain intensional\noperators. On this matter of agreement in logical behaviour when\nunembedded, consider, for example, the introduction and elimination\nrules in a natural deduction system. What they introduce or eliminate\nis the main connective of a formula, so they would not differ in their\nintuitive acceptability in the case of \u201cor\u201d whether this\nwas rendered as Boolean disjunction \u2228 or as Fusco\u2019s\ntwo-dimensional or\n connective.[52]\n More generally, the conditions defining \u2228-classicality (indeed\n#-classicality for any #) of consequence relations or generalized\nconsequence relations pertain only to unembedded occurrences of \u2228\n(or more generally of #). In the case of Fusco (2015), the obligation\noperator O is interpreted by universal quantification over\nsuitably accessible points with the relata of this relation being the\nworlds of local evaluation rather than the world taken as the actual\nworld, which remains the same, so while p\u00a0or\u00a0q\nis a diagonal (though not a\ngeneral) consequence of p, O(p\u00a0or\u00a0q)\nis not a diagonal consequence of\n Op.[53]\n Putting it very informally, this is because from the perspective of\nsome world of evaluation, w, with w itself\nconsidered as actual (since we are working the diagonal case), every\nworld deontically accessible to w, qua world of evaluation,\nmay be a p-world, whereas at w if what is true is\nq but not p, then what is required for the truth at\nw of O(p\u00a0or\u00a0q)\nis that all the accessible\nworlds be q-worlds, since in moving out to the\nw-accessible worlds we are not changing the status of\nw as the world playing the actual world role. (We are in the\n\u2018middle disjunct\u2019 case of (2) with this example.) This\nillustrates how Fusco has arranged matters so that\np\u00a0or\u00a0q and\np\u00a0\u2228\u00a0q end up exhibiting the same\nbehaviour when unembedded but differing behaviour when embedded\n\u2013 in the present instance, in the scope of the obligation\noperator. The story with the permissibility operator, written as may\nor M in Fusco (2015), and not there\ntreated as dual to O, is more complicated, so the interested\nreader is referred to that discussion for the details as well as the\nmotivation behind the choice of or in this\nsetting. For present purposes, the main point to stress is the general\nstrategy of using the two-dimensional semantics to model differences\nin ingredient sense compatible with a given assertoric content.\n\nOne may wonder how much room for manoeuvre is made available by this\ngeneral strategy, which, since are concentrating on connectives here,\namounts to asking how many two-dimensional isotopes a given Boolean\nconnective has. A simpler case than that of the binary connectives\nwith which we have been preoccupied is that of the one-place\nconnectives. A \u2018unarized\u2019 version of the whether\nfeaturing in (3) above arises by choosing the case in which \u03c8 is\n\u00ac\u03c6. This can be written more simply as\nA\u03c6\u00a0\u2194\u00a0\u03c6, used (in effect) as the\ndefinition of what was written as O\u03c6 on p. 119 of\nHumberstone (2002). (There is no intention, in using\n\u201cO\u201d here, to evoke any deontic associations.) If\nwe took O as primitive, we could instead define A by\ntaking A\u03c6 to abbreviate\nO\u03c6\u00a0\u2194\u00a0\u03c6 if we wanted. Either way, if an\nepistemic operator K is treated in the same way semantically\nas the deontic obligation operator above (though with its own\naccessibility relation, of course, or even just using neighbourhood\nsemantics here, as in Lewis 1982, p.\u00a0202), then for purely\nBoolean \u03c6, KO\u03c6, alias\nK(A\u03c6\u00a0\u2194\u00a0\u03c6) ends up\nunrestrictedly equivalent to\n(A\u03c6\u00a0\u2227\u00a0K\u03c6)\u00a0\u2228\u00a0(A\u00ac\u03c6\u00a0\u2227\u00a0K\u00ac\u03c6)\nand thus not a bad approximation to something saying that our\ncognitive subject knows whether (or not)\n \u03c6.[54]\n\nOur main concern here, though, is with formulas constructed just using\nA and the Boolean connectives, and in particular, since we\nare considering the 1-place case, with such formulas as can be\nconstructed with the aid of these devices and a single sentence\nletter, p, say. To see how many two-dimensional isotopes a\ngiven 1-ary Boolean connective (equivalently, Boolean formula in just\none variable) might have, since there are only four such connectives\n(or formulas), to within equivalence \u2013 and for these formulas\nthere is of course no contrast between diagonal and unrestricted\nequivalence \u2013 we should ask how many equivalence classes w.r.t.\nthe relation of unrestricted equivalence there are of the one-variable\n\u2018two-dimensional formulas\u2019 (i.e., here, just\nBoolean-with-A formulas). This question is easy to answer if\nwe bear the following things in mind: first, that every formula is\nunrestrictedly equivalent to one in which A occurs, if at\nall, then just immediately before a sentence letter, and secondly,\nthat w.r.t. the general consequence relation, the formulas p\nand Ap are completely independent (by contrast with the\ndiagonal consequence relation, w.r.t. which they are equivalent). Thus\nthe (unrestricted) equivalence-classes of one-variable formulas\ncollectively manifest the same Boolean algebraic structure as do the\nequivalence classes of purely Boolean two-variable formulas. So you\ncan take your favourite Hasse diagram of this 16-element Boolean\nalgebra[55]\n and, leaving all occurrences\nof p intact, replace every occurrence of q with\nAp, and you now have a picture of all the two-dimensional\none-variable formulas (to within unrestricted equivalence) and the\nlogical relations among them. Each of these 16 equivalence classes (or\nany of the formulas in such a class) is a two-dimensional isotope of\nthe Boolean equivalence class (or any of its elements) we get by\nerasing all occurrences of A in the formulas it contains.\nThus the two-dimensional formulas p, Ap, and\nOp most recently encountered, including the first as a\ndegenerate case of a two-dimensional formula for a streamlined\naccount, are two-dimensional isotopes of p, p, and\np\u00a0\u2194\u00a0p (or \u22a4), respectively. You\nwill find that each element of the 4-element Boolean algebra has four\ndistinct elements of the 16-element algebra mapped to it by this\nerasure-of-A mapping. (This would usually be put by speaking\nof the principal congruence generated by identifying\np\u2019s equivalence class with Ap\u2019s \u2013\nalias q\u2019s \u2013 equivalence class: the smallest\ncongruence relation w.r.t. which these two elements of the algebra are\ncongruent.) For example, p (or its equivalence class) has, to\nwithin unrestricted equivalence, the four two-dimensional isotopes\np\u00a0\u2227\u00a0Ap, the logically strongest\nisotope w.r.t. general consequence (lowest in the 16-element algebra)\nand p\u00a0\u2228\u00a0Ap, the weakest isotope\n(highest in the 16-element algebra), and between these two (and\nmutually incomparable), p and Ap. \n\nReturning to the case of binary connectives or two-variable\ntwo-dimensional formulas, we could reason similarly. (The interested\nreader is left to work the general n-variable case.)\n216 = 65,536 is the number of equivalence classes of\n4-variable formulas, the exponent 16 here being chosen as\n24, the number of equivalence classes of 2-variable\nformulas. So if the variables are p, q, r,\ns, when we collapse the former Boolean algebra into the\nlatter by identifying r with p (thinking of\nr as Ap) and s with q (thinking of\ns as Aq) we are moving from 65,536 elements to 16,\nand a similarly equitable distribution renders each element of the\n16-element algebra as the image of 65,536/16 elements of the larger\nalgebra, which equals 4096 (= 212 = 216/\n24). There is a simpler route to this conclusion, and that\nis by consideration of such Stalnaker-inspired matrices as feature in\nFusco\u2019s discussion (see note 51). This is a 4-by-4 matrix since\nwe have to take into account the local (\u2018world of\nevaluation\u2019) truth-value and the actual truth-value of the first\ncomponent (four possible combinations) of a binary compound and\nsimilarly for the second component, and reading down the diagonal\ngives the truth-table for the Boolean connective of which the original\nis a two-dimensional isotope. Thus in Fusco\u2019s case, this\ndescending diagonal reads \u201cT, T, T, F\u201d, just like the\ndescending vertical column of a familiar truth-table as conventionally\ndisplayed. The latter feature is retained however we label with Ts and\nFs (or 1s and 0s if preferred) the non-diagonal cells, of which there\nare 12 (16 minus the four on the diagonal). Since each of these cells\ncan be filled with either a T or an F, so we are back calculating\n212 and getting the answer 4096, whichever binary\ntruth-function our original diagonal had displayed, including of\ncourse that associated with \u2228. Thus, if you like Fusco\u2019s\ngeneral strategy for responding to difficulties like those faced by\nwhat seemed to be Boolean disjunction behaving badly when deontically\nembedded, there is plenty of room to tweak the details of her proposed\nsolution. \n5. Notes and Sources\n \nUnless otherwise stated, page and (sub)section references in this\ninitial paragraph all pertain to Humberstone (2011), where several of\nthe topics touched on this entry are treated at greater length. For\nexample, the treatment of unique characterization in Section\n 3 of the present entry is largely based on\n\u00a74.3 there. (Some issues touched on here are, however, not\ntreated there at all or are addressed in greater detail here.) In\nconnection with note 6 in the present entry,\nconcerning Carnap's observation that the most familiar logical\nframeworks do not force a Boolean interpretation on the connectives\ntreated by the rules they make available, references to some of the\nmany discussions of this theme can be found under \u2018Strong\nvs. Weak Claim\u2019 on p.\u00a0101. Apropos of\nnote 10 (on sentence-position extensionality) in\nthe present entry, referring the reader to this opening paragraph, see\n\u00a73.2 and subsections 4.37\u20138. For the end of\nnote 11 (the commutativity/symmetry distinction\netc.), what is relevant is subsection 3.34, \u201cOperations\nvs. Relations\u201d (though for more on specifically the relational\nside of that contrast, see Humberstone 2013, especially \u00a74). In\nconnection with note 17 (on\n\u2018non-homophonic\u2019 semantic treatments of disjunction), see\nsubsections 6.43\u20136.46 for a survey of some of these treatments,\nand for note 21 (on separately conservative but\njointly non-conservative extension by new connectives with\nprescribed inferential properties), see p.\u00a0568f. \nFor note 32 (on\nsome of Rautenberg's work on what we are calling hybrids of connectives), see alternatively subsection 3.24. For\nnote 41 (appended to a discussion of contrariety\nand subcontrariety), a more detailed discussion can be found in\nsubsection 8.11 and references given there (especially in Remark\n8.11.1). Expanding on note 45: \u00a75.2 goes\ninto more detail on logical subtraction\n(Example 4.4 above); interesting work by\nStephen Yablo on this topic, mentioned there as then unpublished,\nsubsequently appeared in Yablo (2014), Chapters 8 and 9 being of\nparticular relevance. Apropos of note 55: for an example of a Hasse diagram of the 16-element Boolean algebra, nodes labelled with representatives of the classical equivalence classes of two-variable formulas, see Figure\n2.13a on p.\u00a0225. The bearing on logical theory of the topic of the following paragraph of the present section, Galois connections, is stressed in material on pp.\u00a058f., 75 and 80 in \u00a71.1; the list of\n\u2018Galois connection\u2019 oriented discussions of logical\nmatters given in the bottom paragraph of p.\u00a0101 should be\nsupplemented by a reference to Bimb\u00f3 and Dunn (2008). Finally,\nto supplement the Urquhart reference given at the end of the present section\non head linkage as a special relation in intuitionistic logic, see\nsubsection 9.25. The remainder of the present section gives further\nadditional notes and sources on the present entry working through in\norder.\n\nThe Galois connections described in the opening section are what are\nsometimes called contravariant (as opposed to covariant) Galois\nconnections; they were introduced in somewhat different terminology by\nGarrett Birkhoff (1967). Closure operations as defined in the opening\nsection are sometimes called closure operators. Note that the\ndefinition given, although standard, is much less restrictive than the\nnotion of a specifically topological closure operation (in\nparticular, not requiring C(X\n\u222a Y) = C(X)\n\u222a C(Y)\nor C(\u2205) = \u2205,). Some\nauthors discuss matters of logical theory placing a particular\nemphasis on closure operations and their systems of closed sets (sets\nX with C(X) =\nX); see Pollard and Martin (1996) and references there\ncited.\n\nThe phrase \u201clogical frameworks\u201d has been used in ways\nother than that introduced in Section\n 2,\n e.g., in Huet and Plotkin (1991). The use of \u201c\u227b\u201d\nhere as a sequent separator is occasioned by current HTML font\nlimitations; its general use for that purpose is not recommended.\nCarnap\u2019s observation about logic pursued in \nSet-Fmla\nnot being capable\nof enforcing the intended truth-functional interpretation of various\nconnectives (such as \u2228, \u00ac, and \u2192) has received extensive\nattention in the literature, as was mentioned in the first paragraph of this section. The term \u201ccongruential\u201d\nused here is taken from Segerberg (1982); it is based on a related use\nof the term by D. Makinson (for modal logics in Fmla\ncontaining \u2610 \u03c6 \u2194 \u2610 \u03c8\nwhenever they contain \u03c6 \u2194 \u03c8). In some quarters the term\n\u201cself-extensional\u201d is used for congruentiality, while in\nothers the term \u201cextensional\u201d\u2014used quite differently\nhere\u2014is used for this property.\n\nThe emphasis on (bivalent) valuations throughout our discussion may\nsuggest some limitation of scope: are we not excluding\n\u2018many-valued logic\u2019 (or better: matrix semantics)? And\nwhat about Kripke style semantics in which truth is doubly relativized\nnot only to a model but to a point therein? No, there is no\nlimitation. Every (generalized) consequence relation is determined by\na class of valuations. The matrix assignments of values to formulas\nare homomorphisms from the algebra L of formulas to the algebra\nA\u2014presumed to be of the same similarity type of\nL\u2014of a matrix (A, D), where D\n\u2286 A; D is called the set of designated elements\nof the matrix. Thus the compositional semantics is done in terms of\nsuch homomorphisms, any one of which, h, say, gives rise to a\nbivalent valuation vh defined by setting\nvh(\u03c6) = T iff h(\u03c6)\n\u2208 D, and a Set-Fmla\nor Set-Set\nsequent is valid in the matrix just in case it\nholds\u2014in the usual bivalent sense\u2014on the valuation\nvh for every such homomorphism\nh, the (generalized) consequence relation determined by the\nmatrix is the (generalized) consequence relation determined by the\nclass of all such vh,\n etc.[56]\n Similarly for classes of matrices, with the quantification now over\nall vh where h is a homomorphism\nfrom the language to any matrix in the class. Likewise, in the\nKripke-semantical case, any model M and\npoint x therein gives rise to the valuation\nvMx\ndefined by\nvMx(\u03c6)\n= T iff\nM\u22a8x\n\u03c6,\nand the (generalized) consequence relation determined by a class of\nmodels is that determined by all such vMx\nwith M\nin the class. (This is the so-called\nlocal (generalized) consequence relation; for the global\nvariant, use valuations vM\nwith vM(\u03c6)\n= T iff for all points\nx in the model, M\u22a8x\n\u03c6.) There is\nan obvious further adaptation of these definitions if one wants a\nformulation in terms of determination by (\u201csoundness and\ncompleteness with respect to\u201d) a class of frames rather than\nmodels.\n\nAs well as Prior (1957) cited in Section\n 2\n on the \u0141-modal system, the following references are useful:\nSmiley (1961), Smiley (1962), Porte (1979), Font and H\u00e1jek\n(2002). The original paper is \u0141ukasiewicz (1953).\n\nThe problem with a live-and-let-live attitude toward differences\nbetween logics differing over the logical powers of a connective when\nthe weaker set of powers already suffice for unique characterization\n(\u00aci vs. \u00acc in Section\n 3)\n was already pointed out in Popper (1948), and often re-surfaces in\nsubsequent literature e.g., Harris (1982), Hand (1993), Fari\u00f1as del Cerro and Herzig (1996); see also the opening paragraph of the present section. Uniquely\ncharacterized connectives are sometimes spoken of as implicitly\ndefined, but there are definite risks involved in the latter\nusage\u2014see Do\u0161en and Schroeder-Heister (1985). The\n\u201cimplicit\u201d in the title of Caicedo (2004) does not carry\nquite the same risks, and refers to a special case of unique\ncharacterization, essentially amounting to unique characterization by\nzero-premiss rules in Fmla\u2014i.e., by\naxioms. Similarly, the \u201cfunctionally dependent\u201d\nconnectives of Smiley (1962) are those uniquely characterized by\nzero-premiss rules, taken in concert with the standard structural\nrules, in Set-Fmla\u2014though\nSmiley\u2019s definition is put\nin terms of consequence relations. This class of connectives may well\ncoincide with the class of projection-conjunction connectives. It does\nnot include disjunction or implication, as treated in intuitionistic\nor classical logic, which are uniquely characterized by rules\nessentially containing a non-zero-premiss rule\u2014though these\nwould be uniquely characterized by zero-premiss rules (together with\nthe structural rules) in Set-Set.\nMakinson (2014) also addresses questions of\nexistence and uniqueness in connection with connectives, but his\nexistence questions concern, not the existence of a connective\nsatisfying certain rules (or more generally, certain conditions), but\nthe existence of rules (or this or that kind) satisfied by a given\nconnective, where connectives are individuated semantically (more\nspecifically, by association with bivalent truth-functions). The\nvarious notions of uniqueness considered by Makinson do apply to\nconnectives rather than rules, and are defined in terms of the rules\nsatisfied but the connectives themselves are again individuated\ntruth-functionally and so none ends up amouting to unique\ncharacterization as understood here. See note 1, p.\u00a0365, in\nMakinson (2014) for a discussion contrasting his concerns with those\nfound \u201cin some proof-theoretic studies\u201d, and citing\nDo\u0161en and Schroeder-Heister (1988). (In fact in the footnote,\nthough not in the bibliography, the date is given as 1998.) \n\nId-inductivity is called \u2018regularity\u2019 in Kaminski (1988);\nfor Id-inductivity and Cut-inductivity and related concepts (under\ndifferent names), see also Ciabattoni (2004) and Ciabattoni and Terui\n(2006).\n\nA study of Popper\u2019s generally under-appreciated work in logic is\nprovided in Schroeder-Heister (1984). The faulty view that differences\nover logic amount to talking at cross purposes was defended in\nwritings by W. V. Quine to which references may be found in Morton\n(1973), where this view is subjected to a somewhat milder version of\nthe criticism in Section\n 3.\n A full discussion of substructural logics, also mentioned in Section\n 3,\n and related topics is provided in Restall (2000).\n\nAside from the papers by Prior, Belnap, Stevenson and Peacocke (and\nRead 1988) mentioned in Section\n 3,\n the Tonk example is discussed in (at least)\nthe following places: Wagner (1981), Hart (1982), \u00a74.12 in\nTennant (1978). Interest continues unabated, as witnessed by the\nfollowing publications from the period 2004\u20132006 alone: Hodes\n(2004), Cook (2005), Tennant (2005), Bonnay and Simmenauer (2005),\nChapter 5 of Priest (2006) and Wansing (2006). Subsequent treatments\nof interest include Avron (2010) and Rahmann (2012). Although Tonk\nis Prior\u2019s best known example of\nnon-conservative extension, he also noted the non-conservative effect\nof familiar logical principles concerning conjunction when added to a\npurely implicational intermediate logic; references, details, and\nfurther discussion can be found in Humberstone (2014). For the notion\n\u2013 or perhaps better, notions \u2013 of harmony between\nrules (especially in natural deduction), see the Tonk\nreferences just given, and also Chapter 23 of\nTennant (1987), Weir (1986), Dummett (1991) (passim), Milne\n(1994) and (2002), and Read (2000), as well as the following more\nrecent investigations: Read (2010), Steinberger (2011), Francez and\nDyckhoff (2012), Hjortland (2012), Francez (2014), Milne (2015), Read\n(2015), Schroeder-Heister (2015) and Dicher (2016). For general background in\nproof-theoretic semantics informing these discussions, two useful\nreferences are Schroeder-Heister (2014) and the editor\u2019s\ncontribution (Chapter 1) to Wansing (2015). The subject of harmony is\nalso briefly touched on in Makinson (2014), esp. p.\u00a0369.\n\nMaterial of interest on the subjects of special and universally\nrepresentative connectives can be found in Jankov (1969), Pahi (1971),\nde Jongh and Chagrova (1995), in addition to the references cited in\nSection\n 3.\n For the fact that the relation of head linkage is special in\nintuitionistic logic, see Urquhart (1974) \u2014 not that this terminology appears there.\n",
