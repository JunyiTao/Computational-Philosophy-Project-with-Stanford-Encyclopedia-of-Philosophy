Each module has its own\n\u201cinput\u201d from other modules and sends \u201coutput\u201d\nto other modules. For example, an \u201cauditory analysis\nsystem\u201d module might take as input a heard word and send a\nphonetic analysis to an \u201cauditory input lexicon\u201d. The idea\nof modular organization raises the empirical question of what mental\nmodules there are and how they are linked to each other. A prominent\ntradition of research in cognitive neuroscience has attempted to\ndevelop a model of mental architecture along these lines by studying\nthe responses of normal and abnormal subjects to various stimuli. The\nidea is to compare normal reactions with abnormal ones\u2014often\ncaused by brain damage\u2014so as to draw inferences about which\nmental capacities depend on each other and how.\n\nGlymour [1994] asked the reliabilist question whether there are\ninference methods that are guaranteed to eventually settle on a true\ntheory of mental organization, given exhaustive evidence about normal\nand abnormal capacities and reactions. He argued that for some\npossible mental architectures, no amount of evidence of the\nstimulus-response kind can distinguish between them. Since the\navailable evidence determines the conjectures of an inductive method,\nit follows that there is no guarantee that a method will settle on the\ntrue model of cognitive architecture. Glymour has also explored to\nwhat extent richer kinds of evidence would resolve underdetermination\nof mental architecture. (One example of richer evidence are double\ndisassocations. An example of a double dissocation would be a pair of\npatients, one who has a normal capacity for understanding spoken\nwords, but fails to understand written ones, and another who\nunderstands written words but not spoken ones.) \n\nIn further discussion, Bub [1994] showed that if we grant certain\nrestrictive assumptions about how mental modules are connected, then a\ncomplete set of behavioural observations would allow a\nneuropsychologist to ascertain the module structure of a (normal)\nmind. In fact, under Bub\u2019s assumptions there is a reliable\nmethod for identifying the modular structure. The high-level idea of\nthe procedure is as follows.\n\nEvery hypothesized modular structure can be identified with a\ngraph \\(G\\) containing an edge from module \\(M_1 \\rightarrow M_2\\) if\nmodule \\(M_1\\) calls on module \\(M_2\\). \nEach module graph \\(G\\) is consistent with a set of possible paths\namong modules. Say that a graph \\(G\\) is more constrained than another\ngraph \\(G'\\) if the paths defined by \\(G\\) are a subset of those\nconstrained by \\(G'\\).\nConjecture any module graph \\(G\\) that is maximally constrained,\nthat is, there is no other graph \\(G'\\) more constrained than\n\\(G\\).\n\n",
