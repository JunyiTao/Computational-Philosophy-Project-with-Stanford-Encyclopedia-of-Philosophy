    "main_text": "Objections || The New Knowledge/Old Fact View\n4.6 The New Knowledge/Old Fact View\n\nSeveral positive arguments for the view that Mary\u2019s new knowledge\nafter release constitutes propositional knowledge (genuine\ninformation) have been formulated in the literature. Lycan argues, for\nexample, that Mary\u2019s new knowledge goes along with the elimination of\nepistemic possibilities and that her new abilities are best explained\nby her having new information (for further arguments see Lycan 1996,\n92). Loar (1990/1997) points out that the embedded occurrence of\n\u201cfeels like such and such\u201d in sentences like\n\u201cif pains feel like such and such then\nQ\u201d cannot be accounted for in a model that treats\nknowing what it is like as mere know-how. McConnell (1994) defends the\nmore radical view that the acquisition of knowing-how is normally\naccompanied by the acquisition of a particular new item of\nknowing-that.\n\nMany philosophers find it hard to deny that Mary gains new factual\nknowledge after release and for that reason (if they are physicalists)\nfeel attracted by the New Knowledge/Old Fact View. Positions that\nclearly fall into that category are defended in Horgan 1984;\nChurchland 1985; Tye 1986, 1995; Bigelow and Pargetter 1990; Loar\n1990/1997; Lycan 1990a, 1996; Pereboom 1994; Perry 2001; Byrne 2002;\nPapineau 2002, 2007; Van Gulick 2004; Levin 2007; Balog 2012a,\n2012b.\n\nThe basic ideas common to the New Knowledge/Old Fact View may be\nsummarized as follows:\n\n(1) Phenomenal character, e.g. phenomenal blueness, is a physical\nproperty of experiences (but see Lycan 1990a for an exception who\nconstrues qualia as properties of external objects).\n\n\n(2) To gain knowledge of what it is like to have an experience of a\nparticular phenomenal character requires the acquisition of\nphenomenal concepts of phenomenal\n character.[5]\n\n(3) What it is for an organism to acquire and possess a phenomenal\nconcept can be fully described in broadly physical terms.\n\n(4) A subject can acquire and possess phenomenal concepts only if it\nhas or has had experiences of the relevant phenomenal kind.\n\n(5) After release Mary gains knowledge about phenomenal characters\nunder phenomenal concepts.\n\n\nBut the facts that make these new items of knowledge true are physical\nfacts that Mary knew before release under another\nconceptualization.\n\nThe differences between variants of the New Knowledge/Old Fact View\nconcern the theoretical (physicalist) account of (a) phenomenal\ncharacter, (b) phenomenal concepts of phenomenal characters and (c)\nthe relation between phenomenal characters and the corresponding\nphenomenal concepts. All proponents of the view point out that,\naccording to their proposal, physical concepts and phenomenal concepts\nare cognitively independent: it is impossible to see a priori\nthat something that falls under a physical concept of a\nparticular phenomenal character also falls under the corresponding\nphenomenal concept of that phenomenal character. This is why\nit is possible to have (like Mary) complete physical knowledge about\ne.g. phenomenal blueness (you know everything there is to know about\nphenomenal blueness under its physical conceptualization) without\nhaving a phenomenal concept of blueness and without knowing any of\nthese facts under a phenomenal concept of blueness. Some have argued\nthat the phenomenal conceptualization is not expressible in language\n(see Byrne 2002 and Hellie 2004).\n\nIn general, if a philosopher A claims that the argument of\nphilosopher B does not go through, it is a point in favor of\nhis view if he can provide an error theory, that is if he can explain\nwhy the argument may appear correct in the first place. The\nNew Knowledge/Old Fact View can claim to have an error theory with\nrespect to the knowledge argument. Given the cognitive independence of\nphysical and phenomenal concepts of blueness it appears as if\nwe could imagine a situation where everything Mary knew before release\nwere fulfilled but not what she came to know after release (and this\ncan be taken to imply that she does come to know new facts).\nBut, according to the New Knowledge/Old Fact View this is an illusion.\nThere is no such possible situation. What Mary learns after release is\nmade true by a physical fact that she already knew before her release.\nSome versions of the New Knowledge/Old Fact-View will be briefly\ndescribed in what follows.\n",
