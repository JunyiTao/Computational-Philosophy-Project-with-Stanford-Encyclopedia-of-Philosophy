    "main_text": "Freedom, Sin, and Redemption || Freedom and sin\n4.2 Freedom and sin\n\nThus Anselm takes it to be obvious that freedom is a power\nfor something: its purpose is to preserve rectitude of will\nfor its own sake. God and the good angels cannot sin, but they are\nstill free, because they can (and do) preserve rectitude of will for\nits own sake. In fact, they are freer than those who can sin:\n\u201csomeone who has what is fitting and expedient in such a way\nthat he cannot lose it is freer than someone who has it in such a way\nthat he can lose it and be seduced into what is unfitting and\ninexpedient\u201d (DLA 1). It obviously follows, as Anselm\npoints out, that freedom of choice neither is nor entails the power to\nsin; God and the good angels have freedom of choice, but they are\nincapable of sinning.\n\nBut if free choice is the power to hold on to what is fitting and\nexpedient, and it is not the power to sin, does it make any sense to\nsay that the first human beings and the rebel angels sinned through\nfree choice? Anselm\u2019s reply to this question is both subtle and\nplausible. In order to be able to preserve rectitude of will for its\nown sake, an agent must be able to perform an action that has its\nultimate origin in the agent him- or herself rather than in some\nexternal source. (For convenience I will refer to that power as\n\u201cthe power for self-initiated action.\u201d) Any being that has\nfreedom of choice, therefore, will thereby have the power for\nself-initiated action. The first human beings and the rebel angels\nsinned through an exercise of their power for self-initiated action,\nand so it is appropriate to say that they sinned through free\nchoice.  Nonetheless, free choice does not entail the power to\nsin. For free choice can be perfected by something else, as yet\nunspecified, that renders it incapable of sinning.\n\nIn On the Fall of the Devil (De casu diaboli) Anselm\nextends his account of freedom and sin by discussing the first sin of\nthe angels. In order for the angels to have the power to preserve\nrectitude of will for its own sake, they had to have both a will for\njustice and a will for happiness. If God had given them only a will\nfor happiness, they would have been necessitated to will whatever they\nthought would make them happy. Their willing of happiness would have\nhad its ultimate origin in God and not in the angels themselves. So\nthey would not have had the power for self-initiated action, which\nmeans that they would not have had free choice. The same thing would\nhave been true, mutatis mutandis, if God had given them only\nthe will for justice.\n\nSince God gave them both the will for happiness and the will for\njustice, however, they had the power for self-initiated action.\nWhether they chose to subject their wills for happiness to the demands\nof justice or to ignore the demands of justice in the interest of\nhappiness, that choice had its ultimate origin in the angels; it was\nnot received from God. The rebel angels chose to abandon justice in an\nattempt to gain happiness for themselves, whereas the good angels\nchose to persevere in justice even if it meant less happiness. God\npunished the rebel angels by taking away their happiness; he rewarded\nthe good angels by granting them all the happiness they could possibly\nwant. For this reason, the good angels are no longer able to sin.\nSince there is no further happiness left for them to will, their will\nfor happiness can no longer entice them to overstep the bounds of\njustice. Thus Anselm finally explains what it is that perfects free\nchoice so that it becomes unable to sin.\n",
