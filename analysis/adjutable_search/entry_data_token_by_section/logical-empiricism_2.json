Some Major Participants in the Movement\n\nThe logical empiricist movement is the sum of the interwoven\ntrajectories of its members, so one way of describing that movement is\nto trace those various trajectories. To do so in detail for all those\ninvolved would take rather longer than the movement lasted. That would\nbe inappropriate for one entry in an encyclopedia, especially one in\nwhich entries for many of the members will appear independently. The\nthumbnail sketches of the work of some representative figures below\nshow the breadth and international character of the movement. While\nthe list is long, it covers only a small fraction of those involved\nand leaves out many important thinkers.\n\nA.J. Ayer (1910\u20131989)\nAn English philosopher in the tradition of British empiricism,\nAyer visited the Vienna Circle in 1932\u201333. His book\nLanguage, Truth, and Logic (1936) was a best seller after\nWorld War II and represents logical positivism to many English\nspeakers.\nGustav Bergmann (1906\u20131987)\nBorn and trained in Vienna, Bergmann spent almost all of his\ncareer at the University of Iowa. He was a philosopher of\nscience, mathematician, and metaphysician, who in his early years\njoined in the Vienna Circle. But as his career progressed, his\nideas increasingly diverged from other members of the logical\nempiricist movement.\nRudolf Carnap (1891\u20131970)\nGerman by birth, he taught in Vienna, Prague, Chicago, and Los\nAngeles. He was one of the leaders of the Vienna Circle and of logical\nempiricism, especially of those within the movement whose formulations\nwere more liberal, e.g., with respect to the criterion of\nverification. He defended logical and methodological pluralism and\nworked to develop an epistemic approach to probability.\nWalter Dubislav (1895\u20131937)\nA German logician and philosopher of science, Dubislav was one of\nthe founders, with Reichenbach and Grelling, of the Berlin Society of\nEmpirical (later Scientific) Philosophy.\nHerbert Feigl (1902\u20131988)\nBorn in what is now the Czech Republic, Feigl studied in Vienna\nwith Schlick and Hahn. He emigrated to the U.S. before most other\nlogical empiricists would do so. He taught at the Universities of Iowa\nand Minnesota and founded both Philosophical Studies, with\nWilfrid Sellars, and the Minnesota Center for the Philosophy of\nScience. He is best known for his work on the mind-body problem.\nPhilipp Frank (1884\u20131966)\nThis Viennese physicist and philosopher of science taught at\nVienna, Prague, and Harvard. He was part of a discussion group with\nHahn, Neurath, and others that preceded the Vienna Circle. At Harvard\nhe founded the Inter-Scientific Discussion Group that developed into\nthe Institute for the Unity of Science. He was also one of the\nfounders of the Boston Colloquium in the Philosophy of Science.\nKurt G\u00f6del (1906\u20131978)\nBorn in what is now Slovakia, G\u00f6del took his doctorate under\nHahn in Vienna, studying with Carnap and Schlick as well. He also\nregularly attended Vienna Circle meetings and taught in Vienna. The\nbulk of his career was spent at the Institute for Advanced Study at\nPrinceton. He is best known for his spectacular incompleteness\ntheorems, and his Platonist orientation toward mathematics. Though a\nparticipant in the logical empiricist movement during the Vienna\nyears, G\u00f6del thought that Carnap\u2019s approach to mathematics\ncould be refuted. The alleged proof (G\u00f6del 1995) was not\npublished in G\u00f6del\u2019s lifetime and remains\ncontroversial.\nKurt Grelling (1886\u20131942)\nGrelling was born in Berlin and took his doctorate in\nG\u00f6ttingen under Hilbert. With Leonard Nelson he developed a\nfamous semantic paradox that bears their names. He was one of the\nfounders of the Berlin Society for Empirical (later Scientific)\nPhilosophy. Grelling died in the Holocaust because for bureaucratic\nand political reasons news of an academic appointment in the U.S.\nreached him too late.\nAdolf Gr\u00fcnbaum (1923\u20132018)\nGr\u00fcnbaum moved from his native Germany as a teenager, studied\nunder Hempel at Yale, and spent the bulk of his career at the\nUniversity of Pittsburgh, where he founded the Center for Philosophy\nof Science. The major themes of his work have been philosophy of space\nand time, rationality, and psychoanalysis.\nHans Hahn (1879\u20131934)\nHahn, a distinguished mathematician, took his doctorate in his\nnative Vienna in 1902 and began teaching there in 1905. He was part of\na group with Frank, Neurath and others that discussed logical and\nmethodological issues prior to World War I. After teaching at\nCzernowitz (now in Ukraine) and Bonn he was given a chair in\nmathematics at Vienna in 1921. He was instrumental in bringing Schlick\nthere in 1922 and so was called by Frank \u201cthe actual founder of\nthe Vienna Circle\u201d (Stadler 1997/2001, 642). His most famous\nstudent was G\u00f6del.\nOlaf Helmer (1910\u20132011)\nHelmer took a doctorate in his native Berlin under Reichenbach and\na second doctorate under Susan Stebbing in London. He collaborated\nwith other logically minded philosophers. Indeed, the team of Hempel,\nHelmer, and Oppenheim became known as \u201cH2O\u201d.\nThe bulk of his career was spent at the Rand Corporation.\nCarl G. Hempel (1905\u20131997)\nBorn just north of Berlin, Hempel studied at both G\u00f6ttingen\nand Berlin. Most of his doctoral work was completed under Reichenbach\nwhen the latter was forced to leave Germany. Hempel taught at a number\nof American universities, most famously at Princeton and the\nUniversity of Pittsburgh. He was the doctor father of many prominent\nphilosophers of science, and his work focused on confirmation,\nexplanation, and concept formation.\nRichard Jeffrey (1926\u20132002)\nThis American logician and philosopher of science earned an MA\nwith Carnap (with whom he later collaborated) and a PhD with Hempel\n(with whom he was for many years a colleague and close friend at\nPrinceton). He developed Jeffrey conditionalization (see below) and\ndefended probabilism.\nKurt Lewin (1890\u20131947)\nBorn in what is now Poland, Lewin took his doctorate in Berlin in\n1916. He lectured there in both philosophy and psychology until 1933\nwhen he emigrated to the U.S. via England. Thereafter he taught at a\nnumber of American universities including Cornell, Iowa, MIT, and\nDuke. Credited with founding modern social psychology, he laid the\nfoundations for what is now called sensitivity training as a way to\ncombat religious and racial prejudices.\nRichard von Mises (1883\u20131953)\nBorn in what is now Ukraine, Richard von Mises is the brother of\nthe economic and political theorist Ludwig von Mises. Richard was a\npolymath who ranged over fields as diverse as mathematics,\naerodynamics, philosophy, and Rilke\u2019s poetry. He finished his\ndoctorate in Vienna. He was simultaneously active in Berlin, where he\nwas one of the developers of the frequency theory of probability along\nwith Reichenbach, and in Vienna, where he participated in various\ndiscussion groups that constituted the Vienna Circle. Eventually it\nwas necessary to escape, first to Turkey, and eventually to MIT and\nHarvard.\nCharles W. Morris (1901\u20131979)\nMorris was an American pragmatist and philosopher of language at\nthe University of Chicago when Carnap arrived there. These two,\ntogether with Neurath until the latter\u2019s death, were the chief\neditors of the Encyclopedia of Unified Science. After Carnap\nleft Chicago, Morris moved to the University of Florida.\nOtto Neurath (1882\u20131945)\nThis Austrian philosopher of science and sociologist took his\ndoctorate in political science in Berlin. A member of the First Vienna\nCircle and a leader of the \u201cleft\u201d wing of the Vienna\nCircle, he was also politically active. He was a significant museum\ndirector, and as part of this developed the ISOTYPE picture language.\nHis main philosophic themes were physicalism, anti-metaphysics, and\nthe unity of science. He was the Editor-in-Chief of the\nEncyclopedia of Unified Science until his death. Eventually\nhe fled to the Netherlands and from there to England.\nPaul Oppenheim (1885\u20131977)\nA successful industrialist and heir to a substantial fortune,\nOppenheim was trained in his native Germany in chemistry and\nphilosophy. He was a close friend of Einstein, and helped to initiate\nthe Berlin Society for Empirical Philosophy. Oppenheim collaborated\nwith many important logicians and philosophers of science both in\nEurope and the U.S. He also helped many to escape Nazi oppression, and\ncontinued to help in a variety of ways even after he settled in\nPrinceton in 1939.\nKarl Popper (1902\u20131994)\nBorn in Vienna and with a doctorate there, Popper was intensely\nengaged in discussions with members of the Vienna Circle. His main\nphilosophical work, The Logic of Scientific Discovery\n(1935/1959), appeared in a series edited by Schlick and P. Frank. He\ndid not however, regularly attend meetings of the Vienna Circle and\ngenerally considered himself an outsider. Later he claimed to have\n\u201ckilled\u201d logical positivism. From Austria Popper escaped\nto New Zealand and eventually to the London School of Economics, where\nhe was knighted for his political writings.\nHilary Putnam (1926\u20132016)\nThis American philosopher of science, mathematics, mind and\nlanguage earned his doctorate under Reichenbach at UCLA and\nsubsequently taught at Princeton, MIT, and Harvard. He was originally\na metaphysical realist, but then argued forcefully against it. He has\ncontinued the pragmatist tradition and been politically active,\nespecially in the 1960s and 70s.\nW.V.O. Quine (1908\u20132000)\nBorn in the U.S., Quine took his doctorate and spent his entire\ncareer at Harvard. In 1932\u201333 he visited the Vienna Circle and\nthen Carnap and Warsaw. For the next six years, he said, he was a\ndisciple of Carnap\u2019s and even after they began to disagree,\nCarnap set the agenda. Eventually they clashed over analyticity,\nmodality, and intensional contexts generally. Many similarities of\nview with Neurath are apparent, especially on the issues of holism,\nunderdetermination, and naturalism in epistemology.\nHans Reichenbach (1891\u20131953)\nReichenbach was born in Hamburg and, after immersing himself in\nmathematics, physics, and philosophy, took his doctorate in Erlangen,\nGermany. He was a founder and the leader for the Berlin Society for\nEmpirical (later Scientific) Philosophy. In 1933 he was forced to\nleave Berlin. He went to Turkey and then in 1938 to UCLA. Among his\nmany students were Hempel, Putnam, and W. Salmon, and so almost all\nphilosophy of science in the U.S. can trace its academic lineage to\nReichenbach. Though interested in social and educational reform, he\nworked primarily in philosophy of physics. He developed and defended a\nfrequency theory of probability, and emphasized both scientific\nrealism and the importance of causality and causal laws.\nWesley Salmon (1925\u20132001)\nSalmon was born in Detroit and, after an initial interest in\ntheology, earned his PhD under Reichenbach at UCLA. He taught at a\nnumber of universities including Brown, Indiana, Arizona, and\nPittsburgh. His interests centered on causality and explanation, and\nhis statistical relevance model of explanation can be thought of as\naddressing and in large measure resolving the problem of the single\ncase in frequency theories of probability.\nMoritz Schlick (1882\u20131936)\nSchlick was born in Berlin and eventually took his doctorate there\nin mathematical physics under Max Planck. He taught at a number of\nGerman universities before he was, at the instigation of Hans Hahn,\ncalled to the Chair in the Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences at\nVienna, a chair that was previously held by Boltzmann and Mach.\nSchlick was one of the first philosophers to write about\nEinstein\u2019s relativity theory. He was close to Wittgenstein and\none of the conduits for the latter\u2019s strict verificationism. His\nwork ranges from space and time to general epistemology and ethics. In\n1936 he was assassinated on the steps of the university by a deranged\nstudent.\nWilfrid Sellars (1912\u20131989)\nWilfrid Sellars was the son of well-known philosopher, Roy Wood\nSellars. Wilfrid studied at Buffalo, Oxford, and Harvard before\nteaching at Iowa, Minnesota, Yale, and Pittsburgh. He was a close\nassociate and collaborator with Feigl at Minnesota. (In 1947 he\ndeclared himself a logical empiricist and much later said that he and\nFeigl were for years discrete parts of a single entity.) He defended\nscientific realism, pragmatism, and naturalism, and his philosophy of\nlanguage drew heavily on Carnap\u2019s Logical Syntax\n(1934/1937).\nAlfred Tarski (1901\u20131983)\nBorn and educated in Warsaw, Tarski earned his doctorate under\nLesniewski. He happened to be visiting the U.S. when Poland was\ninvaded and so avoided the fate of so many of his colleagues. He\ntaught at the University of California at Berkeley for more than 30\nyears. While it is unclear whether he should be counted as a logical\nempiricist, he visited the Vienna Circle and hosted its members in\nWarsaw, and his \u201cThe Concept of Truth in Formalized\nLanguages\u201d (1936/1956) was very influential on Carnap and on the\ndevelopment of semantics among the logical empiricists generally.\nFriedrich Waismann (1896\u20131959)\nWaismann was born in Vienna and earned his doctorate there under\nthe direction of Schlick in 1936. From 1926 to 1933 he held\ndiscussions with Wittgenstein, generally in the company of Schlick,\nbut also sometimes Carnap or Feigl. Waismann kept detailed minutes of\nthese conversations. At one point he and Wittgenstein contemplated a\njoint book, but Wittgenstein later changed his mind. Besides the\nprinted text of the Tractatus these conversations were the\nmain conduit of Wittgenstein\u2019s ideas into the Vienna Circle. In\n1937 Waismann was able to emigrate to England. After a couple of years\nat Cambridge, where he was shunned by Wittgenstein, he moved to\nOxford, where he taught until his death.\nLudwig Wittgenstein (1889\u20131951)\nBorn into an immensely wealthy Viennese family, Wittgenstein\nstudied at Cambridge from 1911, where he formed friendships with\nRussell, Keynes, and Moore. His Tractatus\nLogico-Philosophicus (1921/1922), which among other things tries\nto show that logic has no content, was enormously influential on many\nlogical empiricists. Wittgenstein continued to spend much of his time\nin Austria working variously as an elementary school teacher, a\ngardener, and as an architect of a house for his sister in Vienna.\nWhile there he held influential discussions with Schlick, Waismann,\nand others. From 1930 he held teaching posts at Cambridge and\nincreasingly distanced himself from the logical empiricists. His later\nwork focused on ordinary language and inspired many other philosophers\nas well.\n\n",
