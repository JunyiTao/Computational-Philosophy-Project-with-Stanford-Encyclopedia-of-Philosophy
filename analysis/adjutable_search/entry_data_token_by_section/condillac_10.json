    "main_text": "Problems with Condillac\u2019s Sensationism || Materialism\n10.3 Memory and Liberty\n\nIn both the Essay and the Treatise Condillac set out\nto show that all of our cognitive and conative faculties are generated\nfrom sensation and can be derived from that operation alone. To this\nend he identified perception, consciousness, and attention as all\nbeing different aspects of the one operation of sensation. Perception\nis the impression sensation makes upon the mind, consciousness is this\nimpression considered as something experienced by the mind, and\nattention is simply a more vivid perception. But when Condillac came\nto account for memory and reminiscence, this project stalled. It is\nnot implausible to maintain that a sensation might continue to be\nexperienced after the object that occasioned it has ceased to act on\nthe sense organ. But such an \u201cecho\u201d of a past sensation is\nitself a present phenomenon. It might be fainter than other sensations\nthat are now occurring, but being experienced to be faint is not the\nsame thing as being thought to have originated in the past. Rather\nthan explain how sensation can give rise to an awareness of pastness\nCondillac simply helped himself to the notion. In the Essay,\nhe defined \u201creminiscence\u201d as the awareness that a\nperception has been had \u201cbefore\u201d without anywhere\nexplaining how the idea that one thing can be \u201cbefore\u201d\nanother could arise simply from sensation (Essay I.ii.1.\n\u00a715). In the Treatise he distinguished the memory of a\nsensation from a current sensation by calling the former \u201cweakly\nsensing what one was (sentir foiblement ce qu\u2019elle a\n\u00e9t\u00e9)\u201d and the latter \u201cvividly sensing\nwhat one is (sentir vivement ce qu\u2019elle est).\u201d\nBut then he immediately went on to say that recalled sensations can\nsometimes be more vivid than current ones (Treatise\nI.ii.8\u20139). So what necessarily distinguishes remembered\nsensation from current sensation, on this account, is just that\nremembered sensations are of what \u201cwas.\u201d But this is not\nto explain how we could get the idea that a sensation is of what was\nas opposed to what is. \n\nSimilar difficulties arise in connection with the will. In the\nEssay, Condillac supposed that the imagination is initially\noutside of our control. Unless driven by need to conceive the means of\nachieving an end, we imagine what we do only because in the course of\nexperience we sense accidental or natural signs that suggest\nparticular ideas to us. The use of instituted signs is supposed to\nchange this circumstance and give us a new ability to control our\nthoughts (Essay I.ii.4.\u00a7\u00a745\u201346). But it is\nnot clear why this should be the case (note, in this regard, the\napparent contradiction between Essay I.ii.4. \u00a739 and\n\u00a746). Just because a being has acquired the ability to produce\nsigns in order to induce thought, it does not follow that this ability\nmust be under the subject\u2019s voluntary control, and if the\nproduction of instituted signs is outside of our control, it is not\nclear how their use can give us a power to control our thoughts.\n\nThe \u201csensationist\u201d label notwithstanding, there is some\nsuggestion that Condillac may have taken both memory and volition to\nbe primitive functions of the soul that are not in fact reducible to\nsensation. In the Essay he described our awareness of the\ntemporal sequence of our perceptions as a \u201cfundamental\nexperience (premi\u00e8re exp\u00e9rience)\u201d\n(Essay I.ii.1. \u00a715) and in the Dissertation on Liberty\n(\u00a7\u00a79\u201310) he seems to have taken freedom of choice and\nthe ability to spontaneously direct attention to be original abilities\nthat the soul has whenever it is not impelled by some pressing\nneed.\n\nThese views of memory and will are not necessarily inconsistent with\nCondillac\u2019s sensationism, his repeated claims to derive all the\nmind\u2019s capacities from the operation of sensation\nnotwithstanding. There are stronger and weaker ways of understanding\nCondillac\u2019s sensationism. On the stronger understanding,\nCondillac meant to say that sensation produces all of the other\ncapacities of the soul. On the weaker understanding, he only meant to\nsay that sensation instructs us in the proper employment of our\ncapacities. The weaker reading is compatible with allowing original,\nirreducible powers of memory and free choice, provided that we take\nthose powers to be ones that we do not at first know how to\neffectively direct or employ. The stronger reading attributes an\nabsolutely rigorous empiricism to Condillac \u2014 one that does not\nadmit that the mind is endowed with any innate abilities. It is not\nclear what Condillac would have had to gain by insisting on such a\nrigorous empiricism. Locke\u2019s rejection of innate ideas and\ninnate principles was bound up with a reaction to unquestioned\nauthority and a demand that all knowledge claims be demonstrable by\nappeal to common experience. But allowing that we possess innate\ncognitive capacities and innate conative abilities does not interfere\nwith this demand, particularly if we stress, as the weak reading does,\nthat we need to learn how to employ these capacities and abilities,\nand that experience serves as our best and only true teacher. The\npedagogical and methodological conclusions that Condillac most wanted\nto draw still follow from that qualification, without having to invoke\nthe strong reading.\n",
