    "main_text": "A Caveat About Theories\n1. A Caveat About Theories\n\nA theory of development should explain the core phenomena of\ngrowth, cell differentiation, and morphogenesis, which together\ntransform an egg into a mature organism. However, beyond this rough\nconsensus uncertainty abounds. Exactly what entities undergo\ndevelopment, and what are the process\u2019 temporal, spatial, and\nfunctional boundaries? These questions are debated in biology and\nphilosophy (Bonner 1974; Pradeu et al. 2011). Also unsettled are the\nnature and significance of scientific theories. Whether a general\ntheory of development is possible or desirable hinges in part on how\n\u201ctheory\u201d is defined. Yet there is no philosophical\nconsensus to fall back on. Furthermore, developmental biology is not a\ntraditionally theoretical field (in contrast to, say, evolutionary\nbiology; see the entry on\n developmental biology).\n A recent edited collection, Towards a Theory of Development,\nreveals a variety of viewpoints and frameworks, ranging from\nskepticism about any such theory, to specific proposals influenced by\nphysics, mathematics, biochemistry, systems biology, and more (Minelli\n& Pradeu 2014a). Broadly speaking, however,\n\n\nmost developmental biologists have not been strongly interested in\nconstructing an overarching theory of development and\u2026\ndevelopmental biology has not been a focal topic for philosophers of\nbiology. (Burian 2014: xii)\n\n\nThe subject has received little focused attention in biology or\nphilosophy.\n\nThe term \u201ctheory\u201d, for the purpose of this entry, refers\nto broad conceptual frameworks about the nature of the developmental\nprocess as a whole. This is more inclusive and less demanding than\ntraditional philosophical notions of theory; \u201cbig picture\u201d\nviews offering an overall characterization of and/or basic principles\nfor understanding development. Epigenesis and preformation are\nalternative theories in this sense: two persistent ways of describing\nand seeking to explain the development of individual organic form.\n",
