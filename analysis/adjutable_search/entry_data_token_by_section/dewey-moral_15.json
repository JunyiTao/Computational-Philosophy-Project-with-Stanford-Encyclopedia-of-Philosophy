    "main_text": "Moral Theories: the Good, the Right, the Virtuous\n4. Moral Theories: the Good, the Right, the Virtuous\n\nTraditional normative moral theories generally fall into three types.\nTeleological theories seek to identify some supreme end or best way of\nlife, and reduce the right and the virtuous to the promotion of this\ngood. Deontological theories seek to identify a supreme principle or\nlaws of morality independent of the good, and subordinate the pursuit\nof the good to conformity with the moral law. Virtue theories take\nphenomena of approval and disapproval to be fundamental, and derive\nthe right and the good from them. Dewey declined to offer substantive\nanswers to the traditional questions posed by these theories, arguing\nthat no fixed ends or moral rules could be adequate in a world of\nconstant change and plural and conflicting values. In place of fixed\ngoals and rules of action, Dewey offered his method of experimental\ninquiry, which he argued was shared between theoretical and practical\nreason (RP 174). He drew insight from traditional moral theories by\nrecasting their substantive answers to traditional moral questions in\nmethodological terms.\n\nDewey also rejected the reductionist tendencies of these theories,\narguing that each drew from an independent source of evidence about\nwhat one ought to do. Teleological theories draw from the efforts of\nthe individual agent to distinguish the real from the apparent good,\nand to harmonize conflicting impulses by subsuming them under a\ncomprehensive conception of the good. Deontological theories draw from\nthe efforts of groups of people to harmonize and adjudicate the\nconflicting claims they make on one another by means of impartial\nlaws. Virtue theories draw from the praise and blame people accord to\neach others\u2019 conduct. Resisting the tendency of philosophical\nethics to represent the grounds of these theories in metaphysical\nterms, Dewey insisted that the sources of evidence for these three\ntypes of theory were empirical. Teleological theories are based on the\nreflective desires of the individual; deontological theories on the\nsocially authorized demands of interested others; virtue theories on\nthe spontaneous tendencies of observers to approve and disapprove of\npeople\u2019s conduct. These sources of evidence for different sorts\nof moral claims are independent from the others. None carries\nautomatic or conclusive authority. Hence, the tension among the three\ntypes of moral consideration is permanent and cannot be resolved by\nreducing one to another or insisting that one automatically overrides\nthe others (TIF). Resolution of conflicts among these considerations\ndepends on the context in which they arise.\n",
