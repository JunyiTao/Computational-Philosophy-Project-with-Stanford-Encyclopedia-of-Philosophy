    "main_text": "\n\nA handy tool in the search for precise definitions is the\nspecification of necessary and/or sufficient conditions for the\napplication of a term, the use of a concept, or the occurrence of some\nphenomenon or event. For example, without water and oxygen, there\nwould be no human life; hence these things are necessary conditions\nfor the existence of human beings. Cockneys, according to the\ntraditional definition, are all and only those born within the sound\nof the Bow Bells. Hence birth within the specified area is both a\nnecessary and a sufficient condition for being a Cockney.\n\nLike other fundamental concepts, the concepts of necessary and\nsufficient conditions cannot be readily specified in other terms. This\narticle shows how elusive the quest is for a definition of the terms\n\u201cnecessary\u201d and \u201csufficient\u201d, indicating the\nexistence of systematic ambiguity in the concepts of necessary and\nsufficient conditions. It also describes the connection between\npuzzles over this issue and troublesome issues surrounding the word\n\u201cif\u201d and its use in conditional sentences.\n",
