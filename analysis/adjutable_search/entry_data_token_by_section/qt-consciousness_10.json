    "main_text": "Mind and Matter as Dual Aspects || Compositional and Decompositional Approaches\n5.1 Compositional and Decompositional Approaches\n\nDual-aspect approaches consider mental and material domains of reality\nas aspects, or manifestations, of one underlying reality in which mind\nand matter are unseparated. In such a framework, the distinction\nbetween mind and matter results from the application of a basic tool\nfor achieving epistemic access to, i.e., gather knowledge about, both\nthe separated domains and the underlying\n reality.[16]\n Consequently, the status of the underlying, psychophysically neutral\ndomain is considered as ontic relative to the mind-matter\ndistinction.\n\nAs mentioned in\n Section 2,\n dual-aspect approaches have a long history, essentially starting with\nSpinoza as a most outspoken protagonist. Major directions in the 20th\ncentury have been described and compared to some detail by\nAtmanspacher (2014). An important distinction between two basic\nclasses of dual-aspect thinking is the way in which the\npsychophysically neutral domain is related to the mental and the\nphysical. For Russell and the neo-Russellians the\ncompositional arrangements of psychophysically neutral\nelements decide how they differ with respect to mental or physical\nproperties. As a consequence, the mental and the physical are\nreducible to the neutral domain. Chalmers\u2019 (1996, Chap. 8) ideas\non \u201cconsciousness and information\u201d fall into this class.\nTononi\u2019s theoretical framework of \u201cintegrated information\ntheory\u201d (see Oizumi et al. 2014, Tononi and Koch 2015)\ncan be seen as a concrete implementation of a number of features of\nChalmers\u2019 proposal. No quantum structures are involved in this\nwork.\n\nThe other class of dual-aspect thinking is decompositional\nrather than compositional. Here the basic metaphysics of the\npsychophysically neutral domain is holistic, and the mental and the\nphysical (neither reducible to one another nor to the neutral) emerge\nby breaking the holistic symmetry or, in other words, by making\ndistinctions. This framework is guided by the analogy to quantum\nholism, and the predominant versions of this picture are quantum\ntheoretically inspired as, for instance, proposed by Pauli and Jung\n(Jung and Pauli 1955; Meier 2001) and by Bohm and Hiley (Bohm 1990;\nBohm and Hiley 1993; Hiley 2001). They are based on speculations that\nclearly exceed the scope of contemporary quantum theory. \n\nIn Bohm\u2019s and Hiley\u2019s approach, the notions of implicate\nand explicate order mirror the distinction between ontic and epistemic\ndomains. Mental and physical states emerge by explication, or\nunfoldment, from an ultimately undivided and psychophysically neutral\nimplicate, enfolded order. This order is called holomovement\nbecause it is not static but rather dynamic, as in Whitehead\u2019s\nprocess philosophy. De Gosson and Hiley (2013) give a good\nintroduction of how the holomovement can be addressed from a formal\n(algebraic) point of view. \n\nAt the level of the implicate order, the term active\ninformation expresses that this level is capable of\n\u201cinforming\u201d the epistemically distinguished, explicate\ndomains of mind and matter. It should be emphasized that the usual\nnotion of information is clearly an epistemic term. Nevertheless,\nthere are quite a number of dual-aspect approaches addressing\nsomething like information at the ontic, psychophysically neutral\n level.[17]\n Using an information-like concept in a non-epistemic manner appears\ninconsistent if the common (syntactic) significance of Shannon-type\ninformation is intended, which requires distinctions in order to\nconstruct partitions, providing alternatives in the set of given\nevents. Most information-based dual-aspect approaches do not\nsufficiently clarify their notion of information, so that\nmisunderstandings easily arise.\n",
