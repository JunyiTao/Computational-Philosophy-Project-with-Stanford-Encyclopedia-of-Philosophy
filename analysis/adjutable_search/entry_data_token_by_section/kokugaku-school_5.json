    "main_text": "Popular and Grassroots Kokugaku 1800\u20131868 || Hirata Atsutane (1776\u20131843)\n4.1 Hirata Atsutane (1776\u20131843)\n\nHirata Atsutane hailed from Japan\u2019s northeast and moved to Edo\nin 1795 at age 19. He had not even heard of Motoori Norinaga until two\nyears after his death, but his introduction to Norinaga\u2019s\nthought so moved him that two years after that he was admitted to\nNorinaga\u2019s school, which was being run by Norinaga\u2019s son\nHaruniwa. Throughout his future career Atsutane distinguished himself\nfrom his more philologically oriented forebears in Kokugaku by seeking\nverification for his views in the broadest range of places, including\nConfucian and even Christian sources, which he disguised by making\nthem appear Shinto-based. Atsutane even sought the testimony of those\nwho claimed astral travel, reincarnation, and supernatural pedigree in\nsupport of his understandings. This can be understood as his effort to\nuniversalize Shinto, which he styled True Shinto (makoto no\nshint\u014d) by representing it as the fountainhead from which\nderivative and inferior foreign doctrines later emerged. This\nxenophobia together with his vast array of subjects of inquiry ranging\nfrom spiritual matters and kami worship to folklore likely contributed\nto the popularity of his teachings which he intended \u201cto touch a\nperson\u2019s heart\u201d (from Kod\u014d taii, HAZ: vol.\n1, ch.1, 15). \n\nAtsutane championed the pleasures of the here-and-now\u2014good food\nand wine, love and sexual passion\u2014even querying why some long\nfor the afterlife when the present is so blissful. Like Kamo no\nMabuchi and Motoori Norinaga, Atsutane\u2019s Kokugaku included the\nbelief that persons in Japan are endowed as a birthright with True\nHearts (magokoro) that make possible spontaneous conformity\nto the Way of the kami and restoration of an ancient social\nperfection in the present. Through prayer to specific deities, one\ncould \u201clearn from the kami\u201d (kaminarai) in a\nmanner that did not even require literacy. \n\nRegarding the ancient past, Atsutane made a number of claims that went\nwell beyond the near-paradisiac constructions of Kamo no Mabuchi and\nMotoori Norinaga, including perfect health (and ironic invention of\nthe presumably unneeded Way of Medicine); an ancient native script\nprior to the incorporation of Chinese characters; population in\nancient times by a race of Japanese giants; and the argument that the\nrest of the world was fashioned from inferior materials leftover after\nthe pristine creation of Japan. At their worst these expressions of\nsuperiority became unsavory racialized critiques of Others who now\nincluded Europeans.\n\nAtsutane endeavored to recast Motoori Norinaga\u2019s gloomy\nassessment of what befalls humans when their earthly bodies perish.\nWhere Norinaga followed Kojiki in presuming Yomi as the\nsoul\u2019s final resting spot, Atsutane taught that humans all\nbecome kami who proceed to a concealed world that in its\nessential aspects resembles the revealed world of the living. Atsutane\ntook this eschatology a step further by extrapolating implications for\nthe polity. \n\nAtsutane repeatedly insisted upon Japan\u2019s and the Japanese\npeople\u2019s superiority to other countries and peoples:\n\n\nSince Japan has no match among other countries, and since both\nmaterially and in terms of human affairs it is superior to all other\ncountries, the people of this land, because it is a divine land, have\nbeen automatically endowed with true hearts which since ancient times\nhave been known as the \u201cJapanese heart\u201d (Yamato\ngokoro) or \u201cJapanese spirit\u201d (Yamato\ndamashii; from Kod\u014d taii, HAZ: vol. 1, ch.1,\n3).\n\n\nTo Atsutane this in turn had implications for Japan\u2019s destiny in\nthe world: because Japan is \n\n\nthe ancestral country of the ten thousand countries\u2026 our great\nruler is the great ruler of the ten thousand countries\u2026, and\nthe nature of the peace of mind that this provides is likewise\nsuperior to the peace of mind provided by other lands. (from Tama\nno mihashira, HAZ: vol. 2, ch.1, 89) \n\n\nBefore Atsutane, Shinto theologians and Kokugaku scholars said\nrelatively little about the afterlife for human beings. Norinaga had\nconcluded that after death everyone was destined to go to the filthy\nand unpleasant land of Yomi beneath the earth. In his seminal work,\nAugust Pillar of the Soul (Tama no mihashira) which\nhe completed in 1812, however, Atsutane asserts the importance of\nknowing the destination of human souls after death and, thereby, made\neschatology central to Kokugaku scholarship. Atsutane criticized his\nteacher Norinaga for having overlooked the evidence on the matter.\nAfter death human souls go neither to heaven nor the Yomi underworld,\naccording to Atsutane, but rather it is certain concerning the souls\nof the Japanese, \n\n\nfrom the purport of ancient legends and from modern examples that they\nremain eternally in Japan and serve in the realm of the dead governed\nby \u014ckuninushi-no-kami. (Tama no mihashira in SJT: 45)\n\n\n\nThis, in turn, had implications for the polity, since in the revealed\nworld one is subject to the emperor, but in the concealed world one\nbecomes a ghostly spirit, and one\u2019s loyalty transfers to\n\u014ckuninushi-no-kami. Traditionally, this deity had been worshiped\nas an \u201cearthly god\u201d (kunitsu kami) and ruler over\nthe Central Land of Reed Plains (Ashihara no nakatsu kuni),\nand yet Atsutane identified \u014ckuninushi as lord of the\nkakuriyo realm whom souls of the dead were expected to serve\nfaithfully. Atsutane describes the spiritual realm of\ny\u016bmeikai or kakuriyo\n(\u5e7d\u51a5\u754c\uff0f\u5e7d\u51a5) as dark and,\ntherefore, invisible to those inhabiting the world of the living,\nthough those in the spiritual realm could freely see the realm of the\nliving. Because the invisible kakuriyo and visible realm of\nthe living occupied common space, it was believed that souls of the\ndead dwelt near graves or shrines from where they watched over and\noffered protection to their surviving descendants.\n\nIn his concern with eschatology, fertility, the affective realm, the\nsupernatural and cosmology, Atsutane moved Kokugaku in distinctively\nreligious directions, and by jettisoning the arduous philological\nexegesis of forebears like Kamo no Mabuchi and Motoori Norinaga,\nAtsutane made the nativist spirituality of Kokugaku immeasurably more\naccessible, with a special appeal directed toward the farmers who\ncomprised some 80% of the population during his lifetime.\n",
