    "main_text": "\n\nIn the middle of the fifth century BCE, Empedocles of Acragas\nformulated a philosophical program in hexameter verse that pioneered\nthe influential four-part theory of roots (air, water, earth, and\nfire) along with two active principles of Love and Strife, which\ninfluenced later philosophy, medicine, mysticism, cosmology, and\nreligion. The philosophical system responded to Parmenides\u2019\nrejection of change while embracing religious injunctions and magical\npractices. As a result, Empedocles has occupied a significant position\nin the history of Presocratic philosophy as a figure moving between\nmythos and logos, religion and science. Modern\ndebate arises from the lack of consensus on the number of his verse\nworks, their relation to one another, and the coherence of his\nphilosophical system as a whole. This entry will introduce Empedocles,\nhis life and work\u2014traditionally referred to as On\nNature and the Purifications\u2014as well as the\nscholarly debates that continue to dominate study of his philosophical\nsystem. It closes with the influence Empedocles had upon his\nsuccessors. The numbering of the fragments in this article follows\nthat of the Diels-Kranz edition [DK] and Laks and Most 2016;\ntranslations are from Laks and Most.\n\nThe sixth edition of Diels-Kranz\u2019s Die Fragmente der\nVorsokratiker remains the gold standard for the fragments of the\nPresocratic philosophers. In this system of classification, each\nPresocratic thinker is numbered (roughly) chronologically \u2013\nEmpedocles is DK 31 in the series, for example. Following this number\n(which we omit in cases where it is clear we are referring to\nEmpedocles), fragments of each philosopher are subdivided into one of\nthree categories: testimonia, or witnesses to the\nphilosopher\u2019s thought, constitute \u2018A\u2019 fragments; the\nactual words of the philosopher fall under the category of\n\u2018B\u2019 fragments; imitations come under \u2018C\u2019\nfragments. After a fragment\u2019s letter, each also receives a\nsequential distinguishing number. For example, the first fragment of\nEmpedocles referred to in this article, DK 31 A 1, signals that it\narises from the Diels-Kranz edition, focuses on Empedocles, and is\ntestimonium no. 1. In 2016, a new and updated edition of the\nPresocratic philosophers was published with a facing translation by\nAndr\u00e9 Laks and Glenn W. Most. It is now essential to consult\nthis monumental work of scholarship in addition to Diels-Kranz. For\nthis reason, we also include notations from Laks and Most\u2019s edition\nfollowing Diels-Kranz. Laks and Most follow a different system of notation for the\nfragments: \u2018P\u2019 (= person) fragments include those in which\na philosopher\u2019s person is discussed. These give information on a\nphilosopher\u2019s biography, personality, and memorable\nsayings. \u2018D\u2019 (= doctrine) fragments refer to all\nreferences to the doctrine of the philosopher, including their own\nwords. Finally, \u2018R\u2019 (= reception) fragments preserve later\nconceptions of the philosopher\u2019s doctrine.\n",
