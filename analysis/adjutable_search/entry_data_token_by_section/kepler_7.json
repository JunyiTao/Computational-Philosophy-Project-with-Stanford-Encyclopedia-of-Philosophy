    "main_text": "Epistemology and philosophy of sciences || Empiricism\n4.4 Empiricism\n\nA general presentation of Kepler\u2019s philosophical attitude and\nprinciples is not complete without reference to his link to the world\nof experience. For, despite his mainly theoretical approach in the\nnatural sciences, Kepler often emphasized the significance of\nexperience and, in general, of empirical data. In his correspondence\nthere are many remarks about the significance of observation and\nexperience, as for instance in a letter to Herwart von Hohenburg from\n1598 (KGW 13, let. N\u00b0 91, lines 150\u2013152) or from 1603 to\nFabricius (KGW 14, let. N\u00b0 262, p. 191, lines 129\u2013130), to\nmention only two of his most important correspondents. Looking for\nempirical support for the Copernican system, Kepler compares different\nastronomical tables in his MC, and in AN he makes extensive use of\nTycho\u2019s observational treasure trove. In MC (chapter 18) he\nquotes a long passage from Rheticus for the sake of rhetorical support\nwhen, as was the case here, the data of the tables he used did not fit\nperfectly with the calculated values from the polyhedral hypothesis.\nIn this passage, the reader learns that the great Copernicus, whose\nworld system Kepler defends in MC, said one day to Rheticus that it\nmade no sense to insist on absolute agreement with the data, because\nthese themselves were surely not perfect. After all, it is\nquestionable whether Kepler, using for instance the Prutenic\nTables (1551) of Erasmus Reinhold (1511\u20131553), had access\nto complete and correct empirical information to confirm the\nCopernican hypothesis in grand style, as he claimed (for an analysis\nof Reihold\u2019s tables and their influence see Gingerich 1993, pp.\n205\u2013255).\n\nThe situation changed completely when Kepler came into contact at\nPrague with Tycho\u2019s observations (which, as Kepler often\nreports, were seldom at his disposal). However, a change of attitude\nis evident in AN, where he used Tycho\u2019s observations without\nrestriction (which is something he makes clear in the work\u2019s\ntitle). In part 2 (chap. 7\u201321), he presents the \u201cvicarious\nhypothesis\u201d, which in the end he refutes. This hypothesis\nrepresents the best result which can be reached within the limits of\ntraditional astronomy. This works with circular orbits and with the\nsupposition that the motion of a planet appears regular from a point\non the lines of apsides. Against the traditional method, here, Kepler\ndoes not cut the eccentricity into equal parts but leaves the\npartition open. To check his hypothesis, he needs observations of Mars\nin opposition, where Mars, the Earth, and the Sun are at midnight on\nthe same line. From Tycho, he \u201cinherited\u201d ten such\nobservations between the years 1580 and 1600, and to them he added\nanother two for 1602 and 1604. In chapters 17\u201321, Kepler carries\nout an observational and computational check of his vicarious\nhypothesis. On the one hand, he points out that this hypothesis is\ngood enough, since the variations of the calculated positions from the\nobserved positions fall within the limits of acceptability (2 minutes\nof arc). In fact, Kepler presents this hypothesis as the best\nhypothesis which can be proposed within the framework of a\n\u201ctraditional astronomy\u201d, as opposed to his new astronomy,\nwhich he will offer in the following parts of the work. On the other\nhand, this hypothesis can be falsified if one takes the observations\nof the latitudes into consideration. Further calculations with these\nobservations produce a difference of eight minutes, something that\ncannot be assumed because the observations of Tycho are reliable\nenough. Kepler\u2019s famous sentence runs: \u201cthese eight\nminutes alone will have led the way to the reformation of all of\nastronomy\u201d (AN, KGW 3, p. 286; Engl. trans., p. 286). There\nseems to be agreement that Kepler\u2019s AN contains the first\nexplicit consideration of the problem of observational error (for this\nquestion see Hon 1987 and Field 2005).\n\nKepler also gave an important place to experience in the field of\noptics. As a matter of fact, he began his research on optics because\nof a disagreement between theory and observation, and he made use of\nscientific instruments he had designed himself (see, for instance, KGW\n21.1, p. 244). Recent research on the problem of the camera\nobscura and the \u201cimages in the air\u201d shows, however,\nthe limits of a traditional approach to Kepler\u2019s optics\nfollowing the main current of the history of physics. Rather, his\nnotion of experimentum needs to be contextualized within the\nsocial practices and epistemological commitments of his time (see\nDupr\u00e9 2008).\n\nFinally, it should be mentioned that a similar significance is\nassigned to experience and empirical data in Kepler\u2019s\nharmonic-musical and astrological theories, two fields which are\nsubordinated to his greater cosmological project of HM. For astrology,\nhe uses meteorological data, which he recorded for many years, as\nconfirmation material. This material shows that the Earth, as a whole\nliving being, reacts to the aspects which occur regularly in the\nheavens (see Boner 2013, pp. 69\u201399). In his musical theory Kepler was\na modern thinker, especially because of the role he gave to\nexperience. As has been noted (Walker, 1978, p. 48), Kepler made\nacoustic experiments with a monochord long before he wrote his HM. In\na letter to Herwart von Hohenburg (KGW 15, ep. 424, p. 450), he\ndescribes how he checked the sound of a string at different lengths,\nestablishing in which cases the ear judges the sound to be\npleasurable. Kepler does not accept that this limitation is founded on\narithmetical speculations, even if this was already assumed by Plato,\nwhom he often follows, and by the Pythagoreans. On the basis of his\nexperiments, Kepler found that there are other divisions of the string\nthat the ear perceives as consonant, i.e., thirds and sixths.\n\nIf cosmology is the main framework of Kepler\u2019s interest, there\nis no doubt that, as Field has pointed out, he \u201cfelt the need to\nseek observational support for his model of the Universe\u201d (Field\n1988, p. 28; see also Field 1982).\n",
