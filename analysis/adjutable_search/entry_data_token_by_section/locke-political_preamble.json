    "main_text": "\n\nJohn Locke (1632\u20131704) is among the most influential political\nphilosophers of the modern period. In the Two Treatises of\nGovernment, he defended the claim that men are by nature free and\nequal against claims that God had made all people naturally subject to\na monarch. He argued that people have rights, such as the right to\nlife, liberty, and property, that have a foundation independent of the\nlaws of any particular society. Locke used the claim that men are\nnaturally free and equal as part of the justification for\nunderstanding legitimate political government as the result of a\nsocial contract where people in the state of nature conditionally\ntransfer some of their rights to the government in order to better\nensure the stable, comfortable enjoyment of their lives, liberty, and\nproperty. Since governments exist by the consent of the people in\norder to protect the rights of the people and promote the public good,\ngovernments that fail to do so can be resisted and replaced with new\ngovernments. Locke is thus also important for his defense of the right\nof revolution. Locke also defends the principle of majority rule and\nthe separation of legislative and executive powers. In the Letter\nConcerning Toleration, Locke denied that coercion should be used\nto bring people to (what the ruler believes is) the true religion and\nalso denied that churches should have any coercive power over their\nmembers. Locke elaborated on these themes in his later political\nwritings, such as the Second Letter on Toleration and\nThird Letter on Toleration.\n\nFor a more general introduction to Locke\u2019s history and\nbackground, the argument of the Two Treatises, and the\nLetter Concerning Toleration, see\n Section 1,\n Section 4, and\n Section 5,\n respectively, of the main entry on\n John Locke\n in this encyclopedia. The present entry focuses on eight central\nconcepts in Locke\u2019s political philosophy.\n",
