    "main_text": "Literary Forms || Meditation, Soliloquy\n2.7 Meditation, Soliloquy\n\n\u2018Meditation\u2019 as a term for a form of medieval\nphilosophical writings belongs most properly to Anselm and most\nfamously to his Proslogion and Monologion; it is\nclosely related to soliloquy and Augustine\u2019s\nConfessions, as well as some of the works of Bonaventure.\n(Anselm calls his Proslogion an \u201caddress\u201d instead\nof a meditation or soliloquy. The Proslogion is addressed to\nGod, but its method for understanding God is similar to the\nMonologion, which Anselm calls a meditation.) In all these\nworks, the form is that of an introspective search, often in the\nexplicit form of an internal dialogue. While sentence collections and\ndisputed questions make very explicit the different sources and\nvocabularies that clash with each other and with that of the author of\na question, meditation and soliloquy show no particular reliance on\nauthoritative sources.\n\nThe source for Anselm\u2019s meditations is the practice of monastic\nmeditation on texts from scripture or on one\u2019s own spiritual\ncondition. Anselm takes these techniques for focusing the mind and\nuses them as mode of inquiry into problems of speculative theology and\nphilosophy. Anselm\u2019s meditations make no direct reference to\noutside sources, either scriptural or philosophical, but represent\nAnselm\u2019s own thought process as he struggles with what he cannot\nquite understand or prove. In monastic style, he has so thoroughly\n\u2018ruminated\u2019 on his source texts, scripture and\nAugustine\u2019s De Trinitate, that they are essentially\ninvisible to contemporary readers. This independence from authority\nand emphasis on internal exploration also characterizes\nAugustine\u2019s Soliloquies, a \u2018dialogue\u2019\nbetween Augustine and \u2018Reason\u2019, as well as Abelard\u2019s\nSoliloquium, a \u2018dialogue\u2019 between\n\u201cPeter\u201d and \u201cAbelard\u201d on the meaning and\noverlap between the names \u2018Christian\u2019,\n\u2018philosopher\u2019 and \u2018logician\u2019. In his\nItinararium mentis in Deum, Bonaventure draws on a\nparticularly Franciscan form of contemplation, following the path of\nSt. Francis\u2019s mystical ascent to God, based on Francis\u2019s\nvision of the six-winged seraph. In Bonaventure, as in Anselm,\nmeditation is connected to the mystical project of achieving union\nwith God.\n\nAnselm retains the personal and intimate nature of meditation also\ncharacteristic of Augustine\u2019s Confessions. It is worth\nnoting that among the other works that Anselm labels\n\u2018meditations\u2019 are a \u201cmeditation on lost\nvirginity\u201d and a \u201cmeditation on redemption.\u201d These\nare highly personal works, concerned with the existential conditions\nof sin and salvation. The Proslogion and Monologion\nshare with them this personal or existential character. As Anselm\nStolz points out, each step of Anselm\u2019s argument in the\nProslogion either takes the form of or concludes in prayer\n(Stolz 1967, 198\u2013201). According to scholars who take the form\nof the Proslogion as meditation seriously, that form makes it\nimpossible to understand the argument as a \u201cproof\u201d for\nGod\u2019s existence designed to convince an agnostic or atheist on a\npurely rational level. Rather, they argue, the text is an attempt by\nAnselm to address and approach God and is thus written by and for a\nbelieving Christian trying to understand and achieve union with God.\nOn the other hand, other scholars take as most significant in the form\nnot Anselm\u2019s prayers but his complete reliance on his own reason\nwithout apparent recourse to authority, making the form itself an\nimportant model for independent and truly philosophical discourse.\nBoth the introspective element and independence from authority are\nretained in Descartes\u2019 Meditations, about which similar\nquestions have been raised concerning its form. In the Middle Ages,\nthe importance of the form shows the continuation of philosophy or\nphilosophical theology as what Pierre Hadot has called a \u201cway of\nlife.\u201d On this view, until the high scholasticism of the 13th\nand 14th centuries, philosophy was essentially a spiritual and\npersonal project of self-discipline and self-transformation, rather\nthan an abstract and school-based problem-solving set of techniques\n(Hadot 1995, 269\u201370). Christianity before the 13th century,\nHadot argues, presented itself as a philosophy, a way of life, and\nChristian monasticism and its practices of meditations were meant to\nbe a path into this spiritually transformative experience (See Hadot\n1995, 126\u2013141, for the links between ancient \u201cspiritual\nexercises\u201d and \u201cChristian philosophy\u201d.)\n",
