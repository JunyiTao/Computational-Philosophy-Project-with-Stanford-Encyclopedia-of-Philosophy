Identity and Normative Ethics\n\n\nWe have already seen some ways in which considerations of personal \nidentity might be relevant to self-regarding arenas like \nanticipation and prudential concern. We turn now to examine specific ways \nin which personal identity may have implications for the \nother-regarding practical concerns discussed in various arenas of \nmoral philosophy. One of the most widely discussed in the \nliterature thus far has been ethical theory. Most of those working in\nthe field to this point have been appealing to considerations of \nidentity to boost the plausibility of consequentialism, and, more \nspecifically, utilitarianism. There are various ways in which such an\nattempt proceeds.\n\n\nFirst, one might identify a serious objection to utilitarianism, say,\nand then show how considerations of personal identity (or at least of\nwhat matters in identity) dissolve the objection. This is \nthe approach Parfit takes in Reasons and Persons. The \nobjection he is concerned to refute is Rawls' famous \n\u201cseparateness of persons\u201d charge, the contention that \nutilitarianism fails to take seriously the distinction between \npersons, because it controversially jettisons interpersonal \ndistributive principles in exactly the way we uncontroversially \njettison them intrapersonally (Rawls 1971, 22\u201327). That is, in \nextending the principle of rational choice to society-wide \ndecision-making (via use of the imagined impartial spectator), \nutilitarianism treats the interests of all members of society as if \nthey were the interests of one person, and so conflates different \npersons into one. What Parfit suggests is that, if the objection \ndepends on a hard-and-fast metaphysical distinction between persons \n(i.e., on the non-identity of different persons), and if this \ndistinction depends on the further fact of identity \u2013 a \nnonexistent fact if reductionism is true \u2013 then the distinction\nis nothing to take seriously in the first place. Utilitarians, in \nother words, may be reductionists, justifiably ignoring the \n\u201cdistinctness\u201d between persons \u2013 and the \ndistributive principles such a distinction might support \u2013 \nbecause the non-identity of persons is just a less deep fact (Parfit \n1984, 329\u2013345; see also Broome 1991 for a reductionist-based argument\nin support of utilitarianism's account of goodness).\n\n\nThe success of arguments for this conclusion actually depends on the specific \nversion of reductionism being advanced. After all, there are\nseveral possible ethically significant metaphysical units compatible\nwith reductionism, and it turns out that the larger the unit, the less\nsuccessful the argument will be. As the authors on this topic do, we\nwill focus just on the three possible psychological units:\npersons, selves, and atoms. If one believes that the only relevant\nunits are atoms (momentary experiencers) \u2013 given that in the\nabsence of the further fact of identity one believes there\njust are no other unifying relations of any significance\n(i.e., Parfit's Extreme Claim) \u2013 then it is easy to see the\ncomplete analogy between individual lives and sets of lives: neither\nare unified by any significant metaphysical relations, so we could\nthink of them both as just big collections of experiences, in which\ncase there would seem to be no reason to apply distributive principles\nwithin either (or, alternatively, no reason not to apply such\nprinciples to both \u2013 how much weight they ought to bear\nin that case would remain open, however). But notice that if one\nadopts either of the other two psychology-based versions of\nreductionism, according to which either selves or persons are the\nbasic moral units, the argument may not be as successful. If, for\ninstance, it is psychological continuity that matters instead of the\nfurther fact of identity \u2013 and matters just as much as identity\nwas thought to (i.e., Parfit's Moderate Claim) \u2013 then persons are\nthe ethically significant metaphysical units, but then there remains a\nmetaphysical distinction between persons, for psychological\ncontinuity, in the absence of interpersonal connectedness, fails to\nunify sets of lives in the way it does individual lives (see Jeske\n1993, Brink 1997a). And the same goes for strong psychological\nconnectedness, which would unify selves in a way rendering\nthem metaphysically distinct from sets of lives.\n\n\nIt looks, then, as if the only way to bolster support for \nutilitarianism (with a version of this argument, anyway) is \nto adopt the extreme view, that the ethically significant metaphysical \nunits are momentarily-existing person-atoms. But this is implausible,\nfor it is very difficult even to make sense of a momentary \nagent. Agents, after all, have interests and projects they \nseek to advance that necessarily project them into the future. In \norder to be what one is at any moment, then, one must identify with \none's future. \u201cWhen the person is viewed as an agent, no clear \ncontent can be given to the idea of a merely present self\u201d \n(Korsgaard 1989, 114; see also Williams 1976, 204\u2013207, and Brink \n1997b, 112\u2013113). But if one moves away from atoms as the basic moral \nunits for these sorts of practical reasons, the separation between \nselves/persons and sets of lives becomes more distinct.\n\nUnless, that is, one allows that the relations that matter \nin identity can hold interpersonally, in which case a number of \ninteresting possibilities arise. For instance, Brink argues that the \npossibility of interpersonal continuity supports a kind of \nconsequentialism via rational egoism. If one is a rational egoist, \none will aim to promote one's own good. What counts as one's \nown, though \u2013 what counts as contained within the \nprudentially significant metaphysical unit \u2013 given \nreductionism, is defined by psychological continuity (Brink argues \nagainst the coherence or practical feasibility of both atoms and \nselves as the basic units). But if continuity also holds \ninterpersonally, then the rational egoist must, if truly rational, \npromote the good of all those with whom he is continuous, which, \ngiven the thought that each of us bears only six degrees of \nseparation from every other person, generates an important kind of \nimpartial, universalist consequentialism: \u201cthe egoist \ncan recognize derivative but non-instrumental reason to be concerned \nabout others\u201d (Brink 1997b, 127). Of course, if the utter \nimpartiality of a universalist consequentialism is implausible for \nthe way it overlooks the importance to us of the special concern we \nhave for friends and loved ones, perhaps one can introduce the idea \nof degrees of continuity, in which case the concern the \negoist must have for others \u201cis proportional to the amount of \npsychological continuity that exists between the agent and \nothers\u201d (Ibid., 128; see also McMahan 2002, 59\u201366).\n\n\nOf course, while connectedness clearly comes in degrees, it is less \nclear that continuity does. For one thing, if continuity \nconsists in strong connectedness, and what makes for such strength is\nthe obtaining of an amount of direct psychological connections above \nsome specified threshold (as it does for Parfit 1984, 206), then \ncontinuity is not a matter of degree: either strong connectedness \nobtains at each link in the chain or it does not (Belzer 2005). But \neven if we allow that some links in the chain may be weaker than \nothers, if what matters is the existence of the chain, it is\ndifficult to see why its strength in certain patches is relevant. In \nother words, even if we allow that continuity comes in degrees, it is\nnot entirely clear why our patterns of concern ought to track the \namount and not simply the fact of continuity. \nIndeed, if what matters is supposed to be the degree of continuity, \nit might seem to make more sense simply to focus on the more \nobviously scalar relation in which continuity consists, viz., \nconnectedness, as delivering the units of significance in \nthe form of selves.\n\n\nWhile focus on selves could perhaps yield a very complicated form of \nconsequentialism (involving the introduction into deliberation of the\ngood of all affected parties \u2013 including future selves \u2013 \nweighted according to the degrees of connectedness obtaining between \nthem and the deliberator), another, perhaps more promising, approach \nwould be to appeal to reductionist selves to buttress a different \nethical theory altogether, namely contractualism. One longstanding \nobjection to the theory is that it has no way of motivating the \namoralist to adhere to the demands of morality. But we can assume \nthat the amoralist is at least prudentially rational. If so, then one\nvery plausible way to model ordinary prudential deliberation is as \nconsisting of a desire that one's actions be justifiable to all \naffected future stages of oneself (see, e.g., McClennen 1990, 217). \nBut if the relation that matters in identity is connectedness, it \nshould ground such prudential concern in a way that restricts \nrequired justification only to those stages with whom one expects to \nbe connected. Then if connectedness holds interpersonally, the \nrational amoralist must also extend that desire for justifiability to\nall those with whom he is psychologically connected, and this will \ntake him a long ways towards having the moral motivation at the heart\nof contractualism (D. Shoemaker 2000; \nfor the basic view of contractualism presupposed here, see Scanlon \n1982 and 1998).\n\n\nThe views documented thus far all appeal to psychology-based versions\nof the ethically significant metaphysical units. What, though, of\nbiology-based versions? One thought motivating nonconsequentialism\nover consequentialism has to do with compensation:\nnonconsequentialists think it would be unfair to compensate one basic\nmoral unit for a burden undergone by another such unit, something\nwhich consequentialism allegedly permits (Jeske 1993). Here the\nnon-identity of different basic moral units is significant. But what\nare the moral units relevant to issues of compensation? These are most\noften thought to be psychological units, typically reductionist\npersons. But why not think these basic units are instead human\nbeings, individual animal organisms unified by biological\ncontinuity? One reason to do so stems from consideration of cases in\nwhich a child has been made worse off by some burden undergone when\nshe was a fetus, e.g., her mother drank (giving her fetal alcohol\nsyndrome) or her mother's physician was negligent. Here she is owed\ncompensation, we might think, for what happened to her before\nbirth. (And analogous cases might be constructed with respect to\nhumans who become non-persons, perhaps by going into a PVS.) Such\ncases might then suggest that, if compensation presupposes personal\nidentity (or what matters in identity), then the criterion of identity\nrelevant to compensation is biological, in which case ethical theories\ntargeting only psychological units are incomplete (D. Shoemaker 2007,\n338).\n\n\nAs we can see, then, one may deploy reductionism about personal\nidentity in very different ways to achieve very different results for\nethical theory, depending on the basic metaphysical units one\ntargets. Of course, there may simply be no single relation appropriate\nfor grounding all our patterns of concern, i.e., some\npatterns of concern may be grounded in biological continuity, some may\nbe grounded in psychological continuity or connectedness, and some may\ntarget simple momentary experiences. If this is the case, then it may\nbe difficult to see what general uniform conclusions, if any, can be\ndrawn for ethical theory (see Shoemaker 2007; this is what Schechtman\n2014 (80\u201388) calls the Problem of Multiplicity).\n",
