    "main_text": "Boltzmannian Statistical Mechanics (BSM) || Two Challenges: Reversibility and Recurrence\n4.3 Two Challenges: Reversibility and Recurrence\n\nIn\n Section 2\n we have seen that at bottom the physical systems of BSM have the\nstructure of a dynamical system \\((X,\\) \\(\\phi,\\) \\(\\mu)\\) where\n\\(\\phi\\) is deterministic and measure preserving. Systems of this kind\nhave two features that pose a challenge for an understanding of the\napproach to equilibrium.\n\nThe first feature is what is known as time-reversal\ninvariance. Intuitively you can think of the time-reversal of a\nprocess as what you get when you play a movie of a process backwards.\nThe dynamics of system is time-reversal invariant if every process\nthat is allowed to happen in one direction of time is also allowed to\nhappen the reverse direction of time. That is, for every process that\nis allowed by the theory it is that case that if you capture the\nprocess in a movie, then the process that you see when you play the\nmovie backwards is also allowed by the theory; for detailed and more\ntechnical discussions see, for instance, Earman (2002), Malament\n(2004), Roberts (2022), and Uffink (2001).\n\nHamiltonian systems are time-reversal invariant and so the most common\nsystems studied in SM have this property. A look at\n Figure 3\n makes the consequences of this for an understanding of the approach\nto equilibrium clear. We consider a system whose micro-state initially\nlies in a non-equilibrium macro-region and then evolves into a\nmicro-state that lies in the equilibrium macro-region. Obviously, this\nprocess ought to be allowed by the theory. But this means that the\nreverse process\u2014a process that starts in the equilibrium\nmacro-region and moves back into the initial non-equilibrium macro\nregion\u2014must be allowed too. In\n Section 1\n we have seen that the approach to equilibrium is expected to be\nirreversible, prohibiting systems like gases to spontaneously\nleave equilibrium and evolve into a non-equilibrium state. But we are\nnow faced with a contradiction: if the dynamics of the system is\ntime-reversal invariant, then the approach to equilibrium cannot be\nirreversible because the evolution from the equilibrium state to a\nnon-equilibrium state is allowed. This observation is known as\nLoschmidt's reversibility objection because it was first put\nforward by Loschmidt (1876); for a historical discussion of this\nobjection, see Darrigol (2021).\n\nThe second feature that poses a challenge is Poincar\u00e9\nrecurrence. The systems of interest in BSM are both\nmeasure-preserving and spatially bounded: they are gases in a box,\nliquids in a container and crystals on a laboratory table. This means\nthat the system\u2019s micro-state can only access a finite region in\n\\(X\\). Poincar\u00e9 showed that dynamical systems of this kind\nmust, at some point, return arbitrarily close to their initial state,\nand, indeed do so infinitely many times. The time that it takes the\nsystem to return close to its initial condition is called the\nrecurrence time. Like time-reversal invariance,\nPoincar\u00e9 recurrence contradicts the supposed\nirreversibility of the approach to equilibrium: it implies that\nsystems will return to non-equilibrium states at some point. One just\nhas to wait for long enough. This is known as Zermelo\u2019s\nrecurrence objection because it was first put forward by Zermelo\n(1896); for a historical discussion see Uffink (2007).\n\nAny explanation of the approach to equilibrium has to address these\ntwo objections.\n",
