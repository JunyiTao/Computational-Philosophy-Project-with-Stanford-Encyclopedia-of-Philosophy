    "main_text": "Risk Aversion || The Challenge from Risk Aversion\n5.1 The Challenge from Risk Aversion\n\nA final challenge to expected utility maximization is to the norm\nitself\u2014to the idea that a gamble should be valued at its\nexpectation. In particular, some claim that it is rationally\npermissible for individuals to be risk-averse (or risk-seeking) in a\nsense that conflicts with EU maximization.\n\nSay that an individual is risk-averse in money (or any\nnumerical good) if she prefers the consequences of a gamble to be less\n\u201cspread out\u201d; this concept is made precise by Rothschild\nand Stiglitz\u2019s idea of dispreferring mean-preserving\nspreads (1972). As a special case of this, a person who is\nrisk-averse in money will prefer \\(\\$x\\) to any gamble whose mean\nmonetary value is \\(\\$x.\\) If an EU maximizer is risk-averse in money,\nthen her utility function will be concave (it diminishes marginally,\ni.e., each additional dollar adds less utility than the previous\ndollar); if an EU maximizer is risk-seeking in money, then her utility\nfunction will be convex (Rothschild & Stiglitz 1972). Therefore,\nEU theory equates risk-aversion with having a diminishing marginal\nutility function.\n\nHowever, there are intuitively at least two different reasons that\nsomeone might have for being risk-averse. Consider a person who loves\ncoffee but cannot tolerate more than one cup. Consider another person\nwhose tolerance is very high, such that the first several cups are\neach as pleasurable as the last, but who has a particular attitude\ntowards risk: it would take a very valuable upside in order for her to\ngive up a guaranteed minimum number of cups. Both will prefer 1 cup of\ncoffee to a coin-flip between 0 and 2, but intuitively they value cups\nof coffee very differently, and have very different reasons for their\npreference. This example generalizes: we might consider a person who\nis easily saturated with respect to money (once she has a bit of\nmoney, each additional bit matters less and less to her); and another\nperson who is a miser\u2014he likes each dollar just as much as the\nlast\u2014but nonetheless has the same attitude towards gambling as\nour coffee drinker. Both will disprefer mean-preserving spreads, but\nintuitively have different attitudes towards money and different\nreasons for this preference. Call the attitude of the second person in\neach pair global sensitivity (Allais 1953, Watkins 1977,\nYaari 1987, Hansson 1988, Buchak 2013).\n\nThis kind of example gives rise to several problems. First, if EU\nmaximization is supposed to explain why someone made a\nparticular choice, it ought to be able to distinguish these two\nreasons for preference; but if global sensitivity can be captured at\nall, it will have to be captured by a diminishing marginal utility\nfunction, identical to that of the first person in each pair. Second,\nif one adopts a view of the utility function according to which the\ndecision-maker has introspective access to it, a decision-maker might\nreport that she has preferences like the tolerant coffee drinker or\nthe miser\u2014her utility function is linear\u2014but nonetheless\nif she maximizes EU her utility function will have to be concave; so\nEU maximization will get her utility function wrong. Finally, even if\none holds that a decision-maker does not have introspective access to\nher utility function, if a decision-maker displays global sensitivity,\nthen she will have some preferences that cannot be captured by an\nexpectational utility function (Allais 1953, Hansson 1988, Buchak\n2013).\n\nA related worry displays a troubling implication of EU\nmaximization\u2019s equating risk-aversion with diminishing marginal\nutility. Rabin\u2019s (2000) Calibration Theorem shows that\nif an EU-maximizer is mildly risk-averse in modest-stakes gambles, she\nwill have to be absurdly risk-averse in high-stakes gambles. For\nexample, if an individual would reject the gamble {\u2212$100, 0.5;\n$110, 0.5} at any wealth level, then she must also reject the gamble\n{\u2212$1000, 0.5; $n, 0.5} for any \\(n\\) whatsoever.\n\nFinally, the Allais Paradox identifies a set of preferences\nthat are intuitive but cannot be captured by any expectational utility\nfunction (Allais 1953). Consider the choice between the following two\nlotteries:\n\n\\(L_1 : \\{\\$5,000,000, 0.1; $0, 0.9\\}\\)\n\\(L_2 : \\{\\$1,000,000, 0.11; \\$0, 0.89\\}\\)\n\n\nSeparately, consider the choice between the following two\nlotteries:\n\n\\(L_3 : \\{\\$1,000,000, 0.89; \\$5,000,000, 0.1; \\$0, 0.01\\}\\)\n\\(L_4 : \\{\\$1,000,000, 1\\}\\)\n\n\nMost people (strictly) prefer \\(L_1\\) to \\(L_2,\\) and (strictly)\nprefer \\(L_4\\) to \\(L_3,\\) but there are no values \\(u(\\$0),\\)\n\\(u(\\$1\\rM),\\) and \\(u(\\$5\\rM)\\) such that \\(\\EU(L_1) \\gt \\EU(L_2)\\)\nand \\(\\EU(L_4) \\gt \\EU(L_3).\\) The Allais preferences violate the\nIndependence Axiom; when the lotteries are suitably reframed as acts\n(e.g., defined over events such as the drawing of a 100-ticket\nlottery), they violate the Sure-thing Principle or related\nseparability principles.\n",
