    "main_text": "Baudelaire and the Modern\n8. Image, History, Culture\nDebate over Benjamin\u2019s conception of history was for many years\npreoccupied with the question of whether it is essentially\n\u2018theological\u2019 or \u2018materialist\u2019 in character\n(or how it could possibly be both at once), occasioned by the\nconjunction of Benjamin\u2019s self-identification with historical\nmaterialism and his continued use of explicitly messianic motifs\n(Wolhfarth 1978; Tiedemann 1983\u20134). This was in large part the\npolemical legacy of the competing influence of three\nfriendships\u2014with Gershom Scholem, Theodor W. Adorno and Bertolt\nBrecht\u2014applied to the interpretation of Benjamin\u2019s final text,\nthe fragments \u2018On the Concept of History\u2019\n(\u2018\u00dcber den Begriff der Geschichte\u2019,\npopularly known as the \u2018Theses on the Philosophy of\nHistory\u2019). Scholem promoted a theological interpretation, Brecht\ninspired a materialist one, while Adorno attempted to forge some form\nof compatibility between the two. Yet the question is badly posed if\nit is framed within received concepts of \u2018theology\u2019 and\n\u2018materialism\u2019 (the paradox becomes self-sustaining), since\nit was Benjamin\u2019s aim radically to rethink the meaning of these ideas,\non the basis of a new philosophy of historical time. This new\nphilosophy of historical time is the ultimate goal of Benjamin\u2019s later\nwritings. It appears most explicitly, under construction, in\n\u2018Convolute N\u2019 of The Arcades Project, \u2018On\nthe Theory of Knowledge, Theory of Progress\u2019; it is applied to\nart history in the 1937 essay \u2018Eduard Fuch, Collector and\nHistorian\u2019; and is manifest in a condensed, rhetorically\npolitical and problematic form in \u2018On the Concept of\nHistory\u2019. It derives from a dual critique of the \u2018vulgar\nnaturalism\u2019 of historicism and the deferral of action\ninvolved in the associated Social Democratic concept\nof progress (Kittsteiner 1986).  It gives rise to a\nconception of historical intelligibility based on \u2018literary\nmontage\u2019 as the method of construction of \u2018dialectical\nimages\u2019 (AP, 460\u20131). And it culminates in a\nquasi-messianic conception of revolution as an\n\u2018interruption\u2019 of history or an \u2018arrest of\nhappening\u2019: \u201cClassless society is not the final goal of\nhistorical progress but its frequently miscarried, ultimately achieved\ninterruption\u201d (SW 4, 402).\n\nBenjamin took as one of the main \u2018methodological\nobjectives\u2019 of his Arcades Project \u201cto\ndemonstrate a historical materialism which has annihilated within\nitself the idea of progress\u201d, taking as its \u201cfounding\nconcept\u2026 not progress but actualization\u201d\u00a0 (AP, [N2,\n2], 460). He had both philosophical and political reasons for\nthis. Philosophically, Benjamin saw the conventional idea of progress\nas projecting into the future a conception of time as\n\u2018homogenous\u2019 and \u2018empty\u2019 epitomized by the\nattempt of Ranke\u2019s historicism to represent the past \u201cthe way it\nreally was\u201d (SW4, 395; 391). This is a conception of time based\non the temporal continuity of past, present and future,\n\u2018in\u2019 which events occur and are understood as causally\nconnected. It is naturalistic in so far as it acknowledges no\nfundamental temporal-ontological distinction between past, present and\nfuture time; it has no sense of time as the ongoing production of\ntemporal differentiation. Time is differentiated solely by the\ndifferences between the events that occur within it. In particular, it\nfails to grasp that historical time (the time of human life) is\nconstituted through such immanent differentiations, via the\nexistential modes of memory, expectation and action. In this respect,\nthere are affinities between Benjamin\u2019s philosophy of time and\nHeidegger\u2019s (Caygill, 1994). \n\nThe political consequence of the temporal naturalism underlying the\nidea of \u2018progress\u2019 is conformism. For Benjamin,\nparadoxically, this applied in particular to the German Social\nDemocrats\u2019 understanding of communism as an ideal, in the\nneo-Kantian ethical sense of the object of an \u2018endless\ntask\u2019:\n\nOnce the classless society had been\ndefined as an infinite task, the empty homogeneous time was transformed\ninto an anteroom, so to speak, in which one could wait for the\nemergence of the revolutionary situation with more or less equanimity.\n(SW 4, 402)\nIn other words, the concept of progress is demobilizing; and Marxism\nhad become infected by the ideology of progress. However, rather than\npositing an existential alternative, in the manner of Heidegger\u2019s\n\u2018resolute decision\u2019, Benjamin set out to construct novel\nconceptions of historical time and historical intelligibility based on\nthe relationship, not between the past and the present, but between the\n\u2018then\u2019 and the \u2018now\u2019, as brought together in\nimages of the past. Each historically specific \u2018now\u2019 was\nunderstood to correspond to (in a Baudelairean sense), or to render\nlegible, a particular \u2018then\u2019. \n\nIt is not that what is past casts its light on what is\npresent, or what is present its light on what is past; rather, an\nimage is that wherein what has been comes together in a flash with the\nnow to form a constellation. In other words: image is dialectics at a\nstandstill. For while the relation of the present to the past is\npurely temporal, the relation of what-has-been to the now is\ndialectical: not temporal in nature but figural\n[bildlich]. Only dialectical images are genuinely historical\n\u2026 (AP, [N3, 1], 463)\nThe experimental method of montage, borrowed from surrealism, was to\nbe the means of production of historical intelligibility. Furthermore,\nthe \u2018static\u2019 temporality of the image was understood to\nconnect such an experience of historical meaning, directly, to a\nradical or \u2018revolutionary\u2019 concept of action, associated\nwith the idea of the present as crisis. The passage above continues:\n\nThe image that is read\u2014which is to say, the image in\nthe now of its recognizability [das Bild im Jetzt der\nErkennbarkeik]\u2014bears to the highest degree the\n\u00a0imprint of the perilous critical moment on which all reading is\nfounded. (AP, [N3, 1], 463)\nSuch \u201cperilous critical moments\u201d are both immanent to\nthe temporality of modernity, at a structural level (the temporality of\ncrisis), and, in each particular case, contingent and conjuncturally\nspecific. In them, the past is understood \u201cto bring the present\ninto a critical state\u201d. However, this critical state is not a\ncrisis of the status quo, but rather of its destruction: the critical\nmoment is that in which \u201cthe status quo threatens to be\npreserved\u201d (AP, [N10, 2], 474). Dialectical images counter the\nthreat of preservation (tradition) by virtue of the interruptive force\nthey are understood to impart to experience as a consequence of the\ninstantaneous temporality of the now, or what Benjamin famously called\nnow-time [Jetztzeit]:\n\u201cThe dialectical image is an image that emerges suddenly, in a\nflash\u201d (AP, [N9, 7], 473). It is this image of the image as a\n\u2018flash\u2019 [ein aufblitzendes]\nand the corresponding image of historical experience as the discharge\nof an explosive force\u2014the explosive force of now-time, blasting\nopen \u2018the continuum of history\u2019\u2014for which Benjamin\nis probably best known. The philosophy of historical time which these\nimages sum up was elaborated by him in two main contexts: the\ndevelopment of a new conception of cultural history and a political\ndiagnosis of the historical crisis of Europe at the outset of the\nSecond World War.\n\nBenjamin did not see culture as threatened by\n\u2018barbarism\u2019, so much as itself being implicated in\nit:\n\nBarbarism lurks in the very concept of culture\u2014as\nthe concept of a fund of values which is considered independent not,\nindeed, of the production process in which these values originated,\nbut of the one in which they survive. In this way they serve the\napotheosis of the latter, barbaric as it may be. (AP, [N5a, 7]\n467\u20138)\nThe concept of culture as the values of a heritage was for Benjamin\n\u2018fetishistic\u2019: \u201cCulture appears reified.\u201d Only\nan understanding of \u201cthe crucial importance of reception\u2026\nenables us to correct the process of reification which takes place in\na work of art\u201d (SW 3, 267; 269). For Benjamin, however,\nreception\u2014or what he called the \u2018afterlife\u2019\n[Nachleben] of the work\u2014was not merely something that\nhappened to the work, externally; it was as constitutive of\nthe work itself as its \u2018fore-life\u2019 [Vorleben], or\nconditions of production\u2014which are themselves rendered invisible\nby the idea of culture as value, and are themselves \u201cinvolved in\na constant process of change\u201d as the work itself changes. A\nmaterialist cultural history would restore to the experience of works\na sense of both of these changing sets of conditions (before and\nafter), and the conflicts between them, in an engagement\n\u201coriginary for every present\u201d, since \u201c[i]t is the\npresent that polarizes the event into fore- and\nafter-history\u201d\u00a0 (SW 3, 261\u20132; AP, [N7a, 8], 471). It\nis here, in an ontological rethinking of reception, that the\nphilosophical significance of Benjamin\u2019s interest in technologies of\nreproduction lies. With these concepts of fore- and afterlife,\nBenjamin founded a new problematic for cultural study.\n\nBenjamin was interested in \u2018culture\u2019 not as an\nautonomous realm of values (\u201cthe independent values of aesthetic,\nscientific, ethical\u2026 and even religious achievements\u201d),\nbut on the contrary, like the sociologist Georg Simmel, whose Philosophy of Money\nhe cities in this regard, as \u201celements in the development of\nhuman nature\u201d (Simmel, quoted in AP, [N14, 3], 480). In this\nrespect, cultural study is situated within the field of a materialist\nphilosophy of history. And the philosophy of history insists on a\nconception of history as a whole. It is here than the messianic\nstructure of Benajmin\u2019s concept of history confronts us as\nunavoidable; although not thereby necessarily\n\u2018theological\u2019, since it is the transition of a conceptual\nstructure from one philosophical context into another that is at issue\n(Benjamin\u2019s favorite surrealist method of\n\u2018decontextualization\u2019 and \u2018defamiliarization\u2019),\nnot its meaning in its original theological context as such. In his\nsearch for a non-Hegelian, non-developmentalist conception of history\nas a whole, in \u2018On the Concept of History\u2019 Benjamin figured\nnow-time, quasi-messianically, alternatively as a \u2018model\u2019\nof messianic time and as \u201cshot through with splinters of\nmessianic time.\u201d In the context of a diagnosis of the European\ncrisis of 1939\u201340 as a world-historical crisis, the\n\u2018critical state of the present\u2019 thus came, in this text, to\nacquire a theological-political tenor. \u201cA revolutionary chance in\nthe fight for the oppressed past\u201d is compared to \u201cthe sign\nof a messianic arrest of happening\u201d (SW 4, 396\u20137). Benjamin\nwas aware that this rhetoric would lead to misunderstanding. But the\ncombination of perceived political urgency and isolation compelled him\nto extend his concept of history beyond the state of his philosophical\nresearch, experimentally, into an apparently definitive statement. It\nis as if Benjamin had hoped to overcome the aporia of action within his\nstill essentially hermeneutical philosophy (Osborne 1995) through the\nforce of language alone. Formally, however, \u2018On the Concept of\nHistory\u2019 should be read as a series of fragments, in the early\nRomantic sense. As such, it remains resolutely negative\u2014and\nthereby importantly partial\u2014in its evocation of the historical\nwhole, which is acknowledged as unpresentable. In this respect,\nBenjamin\u2019s final text recalls his earliest major publication, the\n1919 thesis \u2018The Concept of Art Criticism in German\nRomanticism\u2019: as a gesture towards the philosophy of history\nneeded to complete a modified and \u2018modernized\u2019 version of\nthe early Romantic project.\n",
