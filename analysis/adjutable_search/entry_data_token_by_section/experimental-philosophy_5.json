As we\u2019ve seen\n (section 2.1),\n evidence on epistemic intuitions plays a prominent role in the\nnegative program. But work in experimental epistemology has not been\ndominated by any one single issue or question. Rather, it has been\ndivided among a number of different strands of research, which have\neach been pursued separately.\n\nOne important topic has been the role of stakes in\npeople\u2019s knowledge attributions. Suppose that Keith considers\nsome available evidence and then concludes (correctly) that the bank\nwill be open on Saturday. Now consider two cases. In the\nlow-stakes case, it is not especially important whether the\nbank actually is open. By contrast, in the high-stakes case,\nKeith\u2019s whole financial future depends on whether the bank is\nopen or not. The key question now is whether this difference in stakes\nhas any impact on whether it is correct to say: \u201cKeith knows\nthat the bank will be open\u201d. \n\nWithin the non-experimental literature, philosophers have appealed to\na wide variety of arguments to help resolve this question. Although\nmany of these arguments do not directly involve people\u2019s\nintuitions about cases (Brown 2013a; see also Fantl & McGrath\n2009; Hawthorne 2004), some specifically rely on the empirical claim\nthat people would be more willing to attribute knowledge when the\nstakes are low than when the stakes are high (DeRose 1992). Among\nphilosophers who accept this empirical claim, there has been\nconsiderable debate about precisely how to explain the purported\nimpact of stakes (DeRose 1992; Hawthorne 2004; Rysiew 2001; Stanley\n2005). \n\nSurprisingly, a number of early findings from the experimental\nepistemology literature suggested that people\u2019s ordinary\nknowledge attributions actually don\u2019t depend on stakes.\nFor example, people seem to say that Keith knows the bank will be open\non Saturday not only in the low-stakes case but also in the\nhigh-stakes case (Buckwalter 2010; Feltz & Zarpentine 2010; May et\nal. 2010). This experimental finding threatens to undermine the entire\ndebate within the non-experimental epistemology literature. After all,\nif there is no effect of stakes, then there is no question as to how\nto understand this effect.\n\nSubsequent experimental work in this area has therefore focused on the\nquestion as to whether the stakes effect even exists at all. Some have\ncriticized the early experiments that did not find an effect (DeRose\n2011). Others have shown that although the effect does not emerge in\nthe experimental paradigms used by those early experiments, it does\nemerge in other paradigms (Pinillos 2012; Sripada & Stanley 2012;\nbut see Buckwalter & Schaffer 2015, for a critique). Regardless of\nhow these debates are resolved, recent experimental work seems to have\nestablished, at a very minimum, that the pattern of people\u2019s\nepistemic intuitions is not quite the way it was assumed to be within\nthe previous non-experimental literature.\n\nA second question concerns the relationship between knowledge and\nbelief. Clearly, a mental state can only count as knowledge if it\nsatisfies certain conditions that go beyond anything that would be\nrequired for the state to count as belief. Thus, there can be cases in\nwhich a person believes that p but does not know that\np. A question arises, however, as to whether the converse\nalso holds. That is, a question arises as to whether a mental state\nmust satisfy certain conditions to count as a belief that go beyond\nwhat would be required for it to count as knowledge. Can there be\ncases in which a person knows that p but does not believe\nthat p?\n\nStrikingly, a series of studies suggest that people do attribute\nknowledge in certain cases in which they would not be willing to\nattribute belief (Myers-Schulz & Schwitzgebel 2013; see also\nMurray et al. 2013; Rose & Schaffer 2013; Buckwalter et al. 2015;\nShields 2016). In one study, participants were given a vignette about\na student taking a history test who faces the question: \u201cWhat\nyear did Queen Elizabeth die?\u201d She has reviewed this date many\ntimes, but at that one moment, she is flustered by the pressure and\ncan\u2019t recall the answer. She therefore decides just to guess,\nand she writes down \u20181603.\u2019 In fact, this is the correct\nanswer. When given this vignette, experimental participants tended to\nsay that (a) the student knows that Queen Elizabeth died in\n1603 but to deny that (b) she believes that Queen Elizabeth\ndied in 1603 (Myers-Schulz & Schwitzgebel 2013, drawing on a\nvignette from Radford). Similar effects have been obtained for\nnumerous other cases (Murray et al. 2013; Rose & Schaffer 2013;\nBuckwalter et al. 2015; Shields 2016).\n\nResearch in this area aims to understand why this effect arises and\nwhat implications it has for epistemology. One view is that\npeople\u2019s concept of belief truly does involve certain conditions\nthat are not required by their concept of knowledge (Myers-Schulz\n& Schwitzgebel 2013). An alternative view is that there is more\nthan one sense of \u2018belief,\u2019 such that knowledge requires\nthe mental state picked out by one of the senses but not the other.\nWithin work that adopts this latter approach, there have been a number\nof more specific suggestions about how to spell out the difference\nbetween the two senses and what relation each has to the ordinary\nconcept of knowledge (Rose & Schaffer 2013; Buckwalter et al.\n2015).\n\nExperimental epistemology has also explored numerous other issues. A\nseries of studies indicate that people actually do attribute knowledge\nin \u2018fake barn\u2019 cases (Cola\u00e7o et al. 2014; Turri\n2017). Others show that judgments about whether a person\u2019s\nmental state counts as knowledge depend on whether that person\u2019s\nevidence comes from facts about an object itself or from statistical\nbase rates (Friedman & Turri 2015). Still others have explored\nissues at the intersection of formal semantics and epistemology,\nexploring the impact of specific linguistic factors on knowledge\nattributions (Schaffer & Szab\u00f3 2014).\n",
