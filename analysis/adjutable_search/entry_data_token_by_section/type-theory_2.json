    "main_text": "Ramified Hierarchy and Impredicative Principles\n3. Ramified Hierarchy and Impredicative Principles\n\n\nRussell introduced another hierarchy, that was not motivated by any\nformal paradoxes expressed in a formal system, but rather by the fear\nof \u201ccircularity\u201d and by informal paradoxes similar to the\nparadox of the liar. If a man says \u201cI am lying\u201d, then we\nhave a situation reminiscent of Russell\u2019s paradox: a proposition which\nis equivalent to its own negation. Another informal such paradoxical\nsituation is obtained if we define an integer to be the \u201cleast\ninteger not definable in less than 100 words\u201d. In order to\navoid such informal paradoxes, Russell thought it necessary to\nintroduce another kind of hierarchy, the so-called \u201cramified\nhierarchy\u201d. The need for such a hierarchy is hinted in Appendix\nB of Russell 1903. Interestingly this is connected there to the\nquestion of the identity of equivalent propositions and of the logical\nproduct of a class of propositions. A thorough discussion can be found\nin Chapter 10 of Russell 1959. Since this notion of ramified\nhierarchy has been extremely influential in logic and especially proof\ntheory, we describe it in some details. \n\n\nIn order to further motivate this hierarchy, here is one example due\nto Russell. If we say \n\n  Napoleon was Corsican.\n\n\n\nwe do not refer in this sentence to any assemblage of properties. The\nproperty \u201cto be Corsican\u201d is said to be\npredicative. If we say on the other hand\n\nNapoleon had all the qualities of a great general\n\n\n\nwe are referring to a totality of qualities. The property \u201cto\nhave all qualities of a great general\u201d is said to be\nimpredicative. \n\n\nAnother example, also coming from Russell, shows how impredicative \nproperties can potentially lead to problems reminiscent \nof the liar paradox. Suppose that we suggest the definition\n\nA typical Englishman is one who possesses all the properties possessed\nby a majority of Englishmen.\n\n\nIt is clear that most Englishmen do not possess all the\nproperties that most Englishmen possess. Therefore, a typical\nEnglishman, according to this definition, should be untypical. The\nproblem, according to Russell, is that the word \u201ctypical\u201d\nhas been defined by a reference to all properties and has been treated\nas itself a property. (It is remarkable that similar problems arise\nwhen defining the notion of random numbers, cf.\nMartin-L\u00f6f \u201cNotes on constructive mathematics\u201d\n(1970).) Russell introduced the ramified hierarchy in order\nto deal with the apparent circularity of such impredicative\ndefinitions. One should make a distinction between the\nfirst-order properties, like being Corsican, that do not\nrefer to the totality of properties, and consider that the\nsecond-order properties refer only to the totality of\nfirst-order properties. One can then introduce third-order\nproperties, that can refer to the totality of second-order property,\nand so on. This clearly eliminates all circularities connected to\nimpredicative definitions.\n\n\nAt about the same time, Poincar\u00e9 carried out a similar\nanalysis. He stressed the importance of \u201cpredicative\u201d\nclassifications, and of not defining elements of a class using a\nquantification over this class (Poincar\u00e9\n1909). Poincar\u00e9 used the following example. Assume that we have\na collection with elements 0, 1 and an operation + satisfying\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n    x+0 &= 0 \\\\\nx+(y+1) &= (x+y)+1\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n\nLet us say that a property is inductive if it holds of \n0 and holds for \\(x+1\\) if it holds for \\(x\\). \n\n\n\nAn impredicative, and potentially \u201cdangerous\u201d, definition\nwould be to define an element to be a number if it satisfies\nall inductive properties. It is then easy to show that this\nproperty \u201cto be a number\u201d is itself inductive. Indeed, 0\nis a number since it satisfies all inductive properties, and if \\(x\\)\nsatisfies all inductive properties then so does \\(x+1\\). Similarly it\nis easy to show that \\(x+y\\) is a number if \\(x,y\\) are\nnumbers. Indeed the property \\(Q(z)\\) that \\(x+z\\) is a number is\ninductive: \\(Q\\)(0) holds since \\(x+0=x\\) and if \\(x+z\\) is a number\nthen so is \\(x+(z+1) = (x+z)+1\\). This whole argument however is\ncircular since the property \u201cto be a number\u201d is not\npredicative and should be treated with suspicion. \n\n\nInstead, one should introduce a ramified hierarchy of properties and\nnumbers. At the beginning, one has only first-order inductive\nproperties, which do not refer in their definitions to a totality of\nproperties, and one defines the numbers of order 1 to be the elements\nsatisfying all first-order inductive properties. One can next consider\nthe second-order inductive properties, that can refer to the\ncollection of first-order properties, and the numbers of order 2, that\nare the elements satisfying the inductive properties of order 2. One\ncan then similarly consider numbers of order 3, and so\non. Poincar\u00e9 emphasizes the fact that a number of order 2 is\na fortiori a number of order 1, and more generally, a number\nof order \\(n+1\\) is a fortiori a number of order \\(n\\). We\nhave thus a sequence of more and more restricted properties: inductive\nproperties of order 1, 2, \u2026 and a sequence of more and more\nrestricted collections of objects: numbers of order 1, 2, \u2026\nAlso, the property \u201cto be a number of order \\(n\\)\u201d is\nitself an inductive property of order \\(n+1\\). \n\n\nIt does not seem possible to prove that \\(x+y\\) is a number of order\n\\(n\\) if \\(x,y\\) are numbers of order \\(n\\). On the other hand, it is\npossible to show that if \\(x\\) is a number of order \\(n+1\\), and \\(y\\)\na number of order \\(n+1\\) then \\(x+y\\) is a number of order\n\\(n\\). Indeed, the property \\(P(z)\\) that \u201c\\(x+z\\) is a number\nof order \\(n\\)\u201d is an inductive property of order \\(n+1: P\\)(0)\nholds since \\(x+0 = x\\) is a number of order \\(n+1\\), and hence of\norder \\(n\\), and if \\(P(z)\\) holds, that is if \\(x+z\\) is a number of\norder \\(n\\), then so is \\(x+(z+1) = (x+z)+1\\), and so \\(P(z+1)\\)\nholds. Since \\(y\\) is a number of order \\(n+1\\), and \\(P(z)\\) is an\ninductive property of order \\(n+1, P(y)\\) holds and so \\(x+y\\) is\na number of order \\(n\\). This example illustrates well the\ncomplexities introduced by the ramified hierarchy. \n \n\nThe complexities are further amplified if one, like Russell as for\nFrege, defines even basic objects like natural numbers as classes of\nclasses. For instance the number 2 is defined as the class of all\nclasses of individuals having exactly two elements. We again obtain\nnatural numbers of different orders in the ramified hierarchy.\nBesides Russell himself, and despite all these complications, Chwistek\ntried to develop arithmetic in a ramified way, and the interest of\nsuch an analysis was stressed by Skolem. See Burgess and Hazen 1998\nfor a recent development.\n \n\nAnother mathematical example, often given, of an impredicative\ndefinition is the definition of least upper bound of a bounded class\nof real numbers. If we identify a real with the set of rationals that\nare less than this real, we see that this least upper bound can be\ndefined as the union of all elements in this class. Let us identify\nsubsets of the rationals as predicates. For example, for rational\nnumbers \\(q, P(q)\\) holds iff \\(q\\) is a\nmember of the subset identified as \\(P\\). Now, we define the\npredicate \\(L_C\\) (a subset of the rationals)\nto be the least upper bound of class \\(C\\) as:\n\n\\[\n\\forall q[L_C (q) \\leftrightarrow \\exists P[C(P)  \\wedge P(q)]]\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nwhich is impredicative: we have defined a predicate \\(L\\) by an\nexistential quantification over all predicates. In the ramified\nhierarchy, if \\(C\\) is a class of first-order classes of\nrationals, then \\(L\\) will be a second-order class of\nrationals. One obtains then not one notion or real numbers,\nbut real numbers of different orders 1, 2, \u2026 The least upper\nbound of a collection of reals of order 1 will then be at least of\norder 2 in general.\n\n\n\nAs we saw earlier, yet another example of an impredicative definition\nis given by Leibniz\u2019 definition of equality. For Leibniz, the\npredicate \u201cis equal to \\(a\\)\u201d is true for \\(b\\)\niff \\(b\\) satisfies all the predicates satisfied by \\(a\\).\n\n\n\nHow should one deal with the complications introduced by the ramified\nhierarchy? Russell showed, in the introduction to the second edition\nto\n Principia Mathematica,\n that these complications can be avoided in some\ncases. He even thought, in Appendix B of the second edition of\nPrincipia Mathematica, that the ramified hierarchy of natural\nnumbers of order 1,2,\u2026 collapses at order 5 for defining the reflexive transitive closure of a relation. However,\nG\u00f6del later found a problem in his argument, and indeed, it was\nshown by Myhill 1974 that this hierarchy actually does not\ncollapse at any finite level. A similar problem, discussed by Russell\nin the introduction to the second edition to\n Principia Mathematica\n arises in the proof of Cantor\u2019s theorem that\nthere cannot be any injective functions from the collection of all\npredicates to the collection of all objects (the version of Russell\u2019s\nparadox in Frege\u2019s system that we presented in the introduction). Can\nthis be done in a ramified hierarchy? Russell doubted that this could\nbe done within a ramified hierarchy of predicates and this was indeed\nconfirmed indeed later (see Chwistek 1926, Fitch 1939 and Heck 1996). \n\n\nBecause of these problems, Russell and Whitehead introduced in the\nfirst edition of Principia Mathematica the following\nreducibility axiom: the hierarchy of predicates, first-order,\nsecond-order, etc., collapses at level 1. This means that for any\npredicate of any order, there is a predicate of the first-order level\nwhich is equivalent to it. In the case of equality for instance, we\npostulate a first-order relation \u201c\\(a=b\\)\u201d\nwhich is equivalent to \u201c\\(a\\) satisfies all properties that\n\\(b\\) satisfies\u201d. The motivation for this axiom was purely\npragmatic. Without it, all basic mathematical notions, like real or\nnatural numbers are stratified into different orders. Also, despite\nthe apparent circularity of impredicative definitions, the axiom of\nreducibility does not seem to lead to inconsistencies. \n\n\nAs noticed however first by Chwistek, and later by Ramsey, in the\npresence of the axiom of reducibility, there is actually no point in\nintroducing the ramified hierarchy at all! It is much simpler to\naccept impredicative definitions from the start. The simple\n\u201cextensional\u201d hierarchy of individuals, classes, classes\nof classes, \u2026 is then enough. We get in this way the simpler\nsystems formalised in G\u00f6del 1931 or Church 1940 that were\npresented above. \n\n\nThe axiom of reducibility draws attention to the problematic status of\nimpredicative definitions. To quote Weyl 1946, the axiom of\nreducibility \u201cis a bold, an almost fantastic axiom; there is\nlittle justification for it in the real world in which we live, and\nnone at all in the evidence on which our mind bases its\nconstructions\u201d! So far, no contradictions have been found using\nthe reducibility axiom. However, as we shall see below,\nproof-theoretic investigations confirm the extreme strength of such a\nprinciple.\n \n\nThe idea of the ramified hierarchy has been extremely important in\nmathematical logic. Russell considered only the finite iteration of\nthe hierarchy: first-order, second-order, etc., but from the\nbeginning, the possibility of extending the ramification transfinitely\nwas considered. Poincar\u00e9 (1909) mentions the work of Koenig in\nthis direction. For the example above of numbers of different order,\nhe also defines a number to be inductive of order \\(\\omega\\) if it is\ninductive of all finite orders. He then points out that x+y\nis inductive of order \\(\\omega\\) if both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)\nare. This shows that the introduction of transfinite orders can in\nsome case play the role of the axiom of reducibility. Such transfinite\nextension of the ramified hierarchy was analysed further by G\u00f6del\nwho noticed the key fact that the following form of the reducibility\naxiom is actually provable: when one extends the ramified\nhierarchy of properties over the natural numbers into the transfinite\nthis hierarchy collapses at level \\(\\omega_1\\), the least\nuncountable ordinal (G\u00f6del 1995, and Prawitz\n1970). Furthermore, while at all levels \\(\\lt \\omega_1\\), the\ncollection of predicates is countable, the collection of predicates at\nlevel \\(\\omega_1\\) is of cardinality \\(\\omega_1\\). This\nfact was a strong motivation behind G\u00f6del\u2019s model of\nconstructible sets. In this model the collection of all subsets of the\nset of natural numbers (represented by predicates) is of cardinality\n\\(\\omega_1\\) and is similar to the ramified hierarchy. This\nmodel satisfies in this way the Continuum Hypothesis, and gives a\nrelative consistency proof of this axiom. (The motivation of\nG\u00f6del was originally only to build a model where the collection\nof all subsets of natural numbers is well-ordered.)\n\n\nThe ramified hierarchy has been also the source of much work in proof\ntheory. After the discovery by Gentzen that the consistency of\nArithmetic could be proved by transfinite induction (over decidable\npredicates) along the ordinal \\(\\varepsilon_0\\), the natural question\nwas to find the corresponding ordinal for the different levels of the\nramified hierarchy. Sch\u00fctte (1960) found that for the first level\nof the ramified hierarchy, that is if we extend arithmetic by\nquantifying only over first-order properties, we get a system of\nordinal strength \\(\\varepsilon_{\\varepsilon_0}\\). For the second level\nwe get the ordinal strength \\(\\varepsilon_{\\varepsilon_{\n\\varepsilon_0}}\\), etc. We recall that \\(\\varepsilon_{\\alpha}\\)\ndenotes the \\(\\alpha\\)-th \\(\\varepsilon\\)-ordinal number, an\n\\(\\varepsilon\\)-ordinal number being an ordinal \\(\\beta\\) such that\n\\(\\omega^{\\beta} = \\beta\\), see Sch\u00fctte (1960).\n\n\nG\u00f6del stressed the fact that his approach to the problem of the\ncontinuum hypothesis was not constructive, since it needs the\nuncountable ordinal \\(\\omega_1\\), and it was natural to study\nthe ramified hierarchy along constructive ordinals. After preliminary\nworks of Lorenzen and Wang, Sch\u00fctte analysed what happens if we\nproceed in the following more constructive way. Since arithmetic has\nfor ordinal strength \\(\\varepsilon_0\\) we consider first the\niteration of the ramified hierarchy up to \\(\\varepsilon_0\\).\nSch\u00fctte computed the ordinal strength of the resulting system and\nfound an ordinal strength \\(u(1)\\gt \\varepsilon_0\\). We\niterate then ramified hierarchy up to this ordinal \\(u(1)\\) and\nget a system of ordinal strength \\(u(2)\\gt u(1)\\),\netc. Each \\(u(k)\\) can be computed in terms of the\nso-called Veblen hierarchy: \\(u(k+1)\\) is\n\\(\\phi_{u(k)}(0)\\). The limit of this process\ngives an ordinal called \\(\\Gamma_0\\): if we iterate the\nramified hierarchy up to the ordinal \\(\\Gamma_0\\) we get a\nsystem of ordinal strength \\(\\Gamma_0\\). Such an ordinal was\nobtained independently about the same time by S. Feferman. It has been\nclaimed that \\(\\Gamma_0\\) plays for predicative systems a role\nsimilar to \\(\\varepsilon_0\\) for Arithmetic. Recent\nproof-theoretical works however are concerned with systems having\nbigger proof-theoretical ordinals that can be considered predicative\n(see for instance Palmgren 1995).\n\n\nBesides these proof theoretic investigations related to the ramified\nhierarchy, much work has been devoted in proof theory to analysing the\nconsistency of the axiom of reducibility, or, equivalently, the\nconsistency of impredicative definitions. Following Gentzen\u2019s\nanalysis of the cut-elimination property in the sequent calculus,\nTakeuti found an elegant sequent formulation of simple type theory\n(without ramification) and made the bold conjecture that\ncut-elimination should hold for this system. This conjecture seemed at\nfirst extremely dubious given the circularity of impredicative\nquantification, which is well reflected in this formalism. The rule\nfor quantifications is indeed\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\Gamma \\vdash \\forall X[A(X)]}{\\Gamma \\vdash A[X:=T]}\n\\]\n\n\n\nwhere \\(T\\) is any term predicate, which may itself\ninvolve a quantification over all predicates. Thus the formula\n\\(A[X:=T]\\) may be itself much more complex\nthan the formula \\(A(X)\\). \n One early result is that cut-elimination for Takeuti\u2019s\nimpredicative system implies in a finitary way the consistency of\nsecond-order Arithmetic. (One shows that this implies the consistency\nof a suitable form of infinity axiom, see Andrews 2002.) Following\nwork by Sch\u00fctte (1960b), it was later shown by W. Tait and\nD. Prawitz that indeed the cut-elimination property holds (the proof\nof this has to use a stronger proof theoretic principle, as it should\nbe according to the incompleteness theorem.) \n\n\nWhat is important here is that these studies have revealed the extreme\npower of impredicative quantification or, equivalently, the extreme\npower of the axiom of reducibility. This confirms in some way the\nintuitions of Poincar\u00e9 and Russell. The proof-theoretic\nstrength of second-order Arithmetic is way above all ramified\nextensions of Arithmetic considered by Sch\u00fctte. On the other\nhand, despite the circularity of impredicative definitions, which is\nmade so explicit in Takeuti\u2019s calculus, no paradoxes have been found\nyet in second-order Arithmetic.\n\n\nAnother research direction in proof theory has been to understand how\nmuch of impredicative quantification can be explained from principles\nthat are available in intuitionistic mathematics. The strongest such\nprinciples are strong forms of inductive definitions. With such\nprinciples, one can explain a limited form of an impredicative\nquantification, called \\(\\Pi_{1}^1\\)-comprehension,\nwhere one uses only one level of impredicative quantification over\npredicates. Interestingly, almost all known uses of impredicative\nquantifications: Leibniz equality, least upper bound, etc., can be\ndone with \\(\\Pi_{1}^1\\)-comprehension. This reduction\nof \\(\\Pi_{1}^1\\)-comprehension was first achieved by\nTakeuti in a quite indirect way, and was later simplified by Buchholz\nand Sch\u00fctte using the so-called \\(\\Omega\\)-rule. It can be seen as\na constructive explanation of some restricted, but nontrivial, uses of\nimpredicative definitions. \n",
