    "main_text": "Relativity and reference frames in classical mechanics || The lingering problem of absolute space\n1.4 The lingering problem of absolute space\n\nNewton understood the Galilean principle of relativity with a degree\nof depth and clarity that eluded most of his \u201crelativist\u201d\ncontemporaries and critics. It may seem bizarre, therefore, that the\nnotion of inertial frame did not emerge until more than a century and\na half after his death. He had identified a distinguished class of\ndynamically equivalent \u201crelative spaces,\u201d in any of which\ntrue forces and masses, accelerations and rotations, would have the\nsame objectively measured values. Yet these spaces, though dynamically\nequivalent and empirically indistinguishable, were yet not equivalent\nin principle. Evidently, Newton conceived them as moving with various\nvelocities in absolute space, though those velocities could not be\nknown. Why should not he, or someone, have recognized the equivalence\nof these spaces, and the dispensability of a distinguished resting\nspace\u2014\u201cabsolute\u201d space\u2014immediately?\n\nThis is not the place for an adequate answer to this question, if\nindeed one is possible. For much of the 20th century, the\naccepted answer was that of Ernst Mach: Newton lived in an age\n\u201cdeficient in epistemological critique.\u201d He was therefore\nunable to draw the conclusion that these dynamically\nindistinguishable spaces must be equivalent in every\nmeaningful sense, so that no one of them deserves even in principle to\nbe designated as \u201cabsolute space.\u201d Yet even those whom the\n20th century credited with more sophisticated\nepistemological views, such as Leibniz, evidently had difficulties\nunderstanding force and inertia in a Galilei-invariant way, despite a\nphilosophical commitment to relativity. We may plausibly suppose that\nit was difficult to abandon the intuitive association of force or\nmotion with velocity in space. It must also have been difficult, in\nthe mathematical context of Newton\u2019s time, to conceive of an\nequivalence-class structure as the fundamental spatio-temporal\nframework. It required a level of abstraction that became possible\nonly with the extraordinary development of mathematics, especially of\na more abstract view of geometry, that took place in the\n19th century. Newton\u2019s arguments established, for the\nassumptions of classical dynamics, the need for a dynamical space-time\nstructure beyond the kinematical structure required to represent\nchanges of relative position over time. But absolute space, with its\nsuperfluous elements, was the only such structure imagined for the\nnext two centuries. It was accepted as the only realistic alternative\nto theories with no dynamical structure at all. There was as yet no\nnotion of a structure that expressed all and only what was\nrequired by the dynamical laws. Euler, for example, in a penetrating\ncritique of Leibnizian relationalism (1748), argued that the laws of\nmotion require a notion of sameness of direction in space, and of\nuniform motion with respect to time. The truth of the laws of\nmotion\u2014which, for Euler, were more securely established than any\nprinciple of metaphysics\u2014could not, therefore, be reconciled\nwith any account of space and time as merely ideal. But he did not see\nthe possibility of separating true acceleration and rotation from true\nvelocity with respect to absolute space. \n\nIn the 17th century, only Huygens came close to expressing\nsuch a view; he held that not velocity, but velocity-difference, was\nthe fundamental dynamical quantity. He therefore understood, for\nexample, that the \u201cabsoluteness\u201d of rotation had nothing\nto do with velocity relative to absolute space. Instead, it arose from\nthe difference of velocity among different parts of a rotating body.\nIf a disk is translated through space without rotation, then its parts\nmove in parallel lines, but if it is rotating, then they move in\ndifferent directions, even though they are at rest relative to one\nanother on account of the bonds holding them together. The\ndifferences, evidently, would be the same irrespective of the velocity\nof the body as a whole in absolute space. Unfortunately, Huygens\nexpressed this view only in manuscripts that remained unpublished for\ntwo centuries. (Cf. Stein, 1977, pp. 9\u201310 and Appendix III.)\nHuygens also reflected on the possibility of replacing absolute space\nwith (what we would call) empirical frames of reference, again in\nunpublished notes that have only been brought to light in recent work\nby Stan (2016). But the complete concept of the inertial frame emerged\nonly in the late 19th century, when it did not seem to be\nof any great immediate importance (see below). Indeed, even after the\nconcept of inertial frame had been widely discussed, the notion\npersisted that true rotation could only be understood as rotation with\nrespect to absolute space. Poincar\u00e9, for example, convinced of\nthe essential \u201crelativity of space\u201d as well as the\nrelativity of motion, considered the concept of absolute space to be\nsomething of a philosophical embarrassment. But it was not clear to\nhim how the dynamical phenomena of rotation could be understood\nwithout it (cf. DiSalle 2014). So the failure of Newton and Huygens to\nformulate the concept of inertial frame, two centuries earlier, seems\nless remarkable than the progress that each of them made in\nunderstanding the relativity of motion. As we will see, articulating\nthis concept involved synthesizing (in effect) insights of Newton,\nHuygens, and Euler.\n",
