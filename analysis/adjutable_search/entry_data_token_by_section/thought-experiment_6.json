    "main_text": "Current Views on Thought Experiments || The Argument View\n4.3 The Argument View\n\nJohn D. Norton is the most influential advocate of what we call\n\u201cthe argument view\u201d of thought experiments (see Norton\n1991, 1993, 1996, 2004a,b, 2008). Even though the argument view seems\nto be a natural option for empiricists, it seems that most empiricists\nfind Norton\u2019s argument view too strong. For this reason, many\nparticipants in the debate about thought experiments place themselves\nbetween the extreme views of Norton and Brown, which function as\nuseful foils for apparently more moderate outlooks. Perhaps (with\ntongue in cheek) they could agree with Bernard Shaw on the virtues of\nmoderation, when Shaw said of the typical member of the middle class\nthat he is moderately honest, moderately intelligent, and moderately\nfaithful to his spouse. Norton claims that any thought experiment is\nreally a (possibly disguised) argument; it starts with premises\ngrounded in experience and follows deductive or inductive rules of\ninference in arriving at its conclusion. The picturesque features of\nany thought experiment which give it an experimental flavour might be\npsychologically helpful, but are strictly redundant. Thus, says\nNorton, we never go beyond the empirical premises in a way to which\nany empiricist would object.\n\nThere are three objections that might be offered against Norton.\nFirst, his notion of argument is too vague. However, this might not be\nthe best objection: arguments can be deductive (which are perfectly\nclear) or inductive. If the latter are unclear, the fault is with\ninduction, not with Norton\u2019s argument view. Second, it is argued\nthat Norton simply begs the question: every real world experiment can\nbe rephrased as an argument, but nobody would say that real world\nexperiences are dispensable. The account does not address the\nquestion: where do the premises come from? A thought experiment might\nbe an essential step in making the Norton-style reconstruction. Third,\na thought experiment that is presented in argument form loses its\ntypical force. The soft-point in Brown\u2019s Platonism is linked to\nthe strength of Norton\u2019s account because Norton claims that any\nother view implies a commitment to \u201casking the oracle.\u201d\n\u201cImagine an oracle that claims mysterious powers but never\ndelivers predictions that could not be learned by simple inferences\nfrom ordinary experience. We would not believe that the oracle had any\nmysterious powers. I propose the same verdict for thought experiments\nin science\u201d (Norton 1996, pp. 1142\u20131143). Defenders of\nempiricist alternatives deny this dispensability thesis. Brendel\n(2018) offers a most comprehensive review of merits and perils of the\nargument view.\n",
