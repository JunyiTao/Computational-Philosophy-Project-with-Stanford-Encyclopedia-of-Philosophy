    "main_text": "The Theory of Meaning\n4. The Theory of Meaning\n\nThe basic idea of the standard medieval realist theories of meaning\nwas that semantic classifications derive from ontological differences\namong the signified objects. So, according to this approach, the\nsimple expressions of our language (i.e., names) are distinct from the\ncomplex expressions (i.e., sentences) by virtue of their own\nsignificata, that is by virtue of the different kinds of\nobjects they make known. In fact, the objects signified by complex\nexpressions are compounds of (at least) two of the objects signified\nby simple expressions and a relation of identity (or non-identity, in\nthe case of a true negative sentence), while a simple object is an\nitem in a category (i.e., either a singular substance, or a\nsubstantial form, or an accidental form). Furthermore, every simple\nexpression of our language is like a label naming just one\nobject in the world, but whereas proper names and singular expressions\nlabel individuals (i.e., token-objects), general terms label common\nnatures (i.e., type-objects), which are the main metaphysical\nconstituents of the set of individuals instantiating them. For\ninstance, the general expression \u2018man\u2019 labels and can\nstand for each and every man only because of its primarily signifying\nthe universal form of humanity qua being present in each and\nevery man as the main constitutive principle of his essence.\n\nSharpe rejects the standard realist criteria for the generality (or\nuniversality, according to his terminology) of terms, and\nsubstantially accepts the sense of nominalist criticisms. In his\nopinion, to be matched by a common nature really existing in the world\nis no longer the necessary and sufficient condition for being a\ngeneral term. Rather, signifying universally (that is, signifying a\nunitary concept that in turn refers to a multiplicity of things\ndisplaying at least a similar mode of being [QsU, pp.\n129\u201330]) is a condition for semantic universality of equal\nimportance. He thinks that those terms which signify universally have\nto be viewed as common, as well as those signifying a common nature\nexisting outside the intellect (ibid., p. 69). Thus,\naccording to Sharpe, there are six different kinds of general\nexpressions, both spoken and written:\n\nthose that universally signify a common nature really existing in\nthe world (in re), like the term \u2018humanity\u2019;\nthose that universally connote a common nature really existing in\nthe world, without directly signifying it, like the term\n\u2018white\u2019 (\u2018album\u2019), which refers to\nwhite things and connotes the form of whiteness;\nthose that do not refer to anything really existing in the world,\nbut are somehow correlated with a universal concept, like the terms\n\u2018void\u2019 and \u2018chimaera\u2019;\nthose to which no common nature really existing in the world\ncorresponds, but rather a common transcategorial negative concept,\nunder which a multiplicity of things can be collected, like the term\n\u2018individual\u2019 (the negative concept involved here is the\nconcept of incommunicabilitas, or\nimpossibility-of-being-common, which characterizes individuals);\nequivocal terms as such, since they are connected with a\nmultiplicity of different notions;\ndemonstrative pronouns, like \u2018this (one)\u2019\n(\u2018hoc\u2019), when used to supposit for (refer to) a\ncommon nature, even though they can signify in a singular manner\n(discrete) only (ibid., pp. 69\u201371).\n\n\nAs is evident, Sharpe\u2019s analysis of the types of universality\nfor linguistic terms is based on two distinct but compatible criteria:\n(i) the existence of a common nature directly or indirectly signified\nby them, and (ii) the universal mode of signifying \u2013 the latter\nbeing more important than the former. Thus, based on the satisfaction\nof these two criteria, Sharpe himself reduces the preceding division\nof the kinds of universality to a threefold partition: (i) terms that\nsignify in a universal mode a common nature existing in re\nand which are thus properly common, such as\n\u2018homo\u2019; (ii) terms that signify in a universal\nmode but do not refer to any common nature in re and which\nare thus common in a less proper way, such as\n\u2018chimaera\u2019 and \u2018persona\u2019;\nfinally, (iii) terms that do not signify in a universal mode and which\nare thus common in an improper way whenever they refer to a common\nnature existing in re , such as \u2018hoc\u2019\nand other demonstrative pronouns (QsU, p. 71).\n\nIn turn, mental concepts are common in four ways only, corresponding\nto the first four ways of universality peculiar to spoken (and\nwritten) terms, since there are no universal concepts that correspond\nto demonstrative pronouns or equivocal terms as such\n(ibidem).\n\nThe fourth kind of general term deserves particular attention, since\nit is connected with Sharpe\u2019s solution to the question of the\nsemantic and ontological status of terms of second intention like\n\u2018individual\u2019 or \u2018singular. This was a highly\ncontroversial question in Oxford at the end of the 14th\ncentury. The most common explanation was that proposed by Robert\nAlyngton, a fellow of Queen\u2019s College in the 1380s. According to\nAlyngton, terms like \u2018individual\u2019 have to be considered\nsingular expressions; more precisely they are\n\u201crange-narrowed\u201d expressions, like \u2018this man\u2019,\nbecause they identify a singular referent as a member of a given set\nof individuals. In fact, a term like \u2018individual\u2019\npresupposes a general concept (that of being), the range of which is\nnarrowed to a unique object among beings by an act of our intellect\n\u2013 to one object that is not common. Sharpe, however, argues that\nAlyngton\u2019s answer goes against linguistic usage as well as an\nestablished fact: if Alyngton were right, then the following argument\n(which everybody will admit) would be formally incorrect:\n\n\n\nman runs \n(homo currit) \n\nand not the universal-man \n(et non homo communis) \n\ntherefore, an individual man runs \n(ergo homo singularis currit) \n\n\n\njust like this one:\n\n\n\nman runs \n(homo currit) \n\nand not the universal-man \n(et non homo communis) \n\ntherefore, Socrates runs \n(ergo Sortes currit), \n\n\n\nsince the syntagm \u2018an individual man\u2019 (\u2018homo\nsingularis\u2019) would be a singular term standing precisely\nfor one individual, e.g., \u2018Socrates\u2019\n(\u2018Sortes\u2019). Furthermore, it is a fact that anyone\ncan understand the sentence \u2018an individual man runs\u2019 even\nwithout knowing the identity of the man who is running \u2013 which\nis required according to Alyngton\u2019s theory. Therefore, Sharpe\nregarded second intentions of this kind as common ones\n(ibid., pp. 132\u201333).\n\nIn this way, Sharpe admits that the nominalist explanation of the\nuniversality of signs holds in the particular context of second\nintentions, implicitly rejecting Alyngton\u2019s reduction of\nepistemology to ontology, since according to Sharpe\u2019s account\nthe former has its own range and rules partially independent of the\nlatter. Furthermore, he restores the semantic rank that intuitively\nwould be assigned to the \u2018individual\u2019-like terms\n(something Alyngton was unable to do). On the other hand, his defence\nof realism on the problem of universals is partially invalidated by\nhis qualified acceptance of the nominalist principle of the autonomy\nof thought in relation to the world. In fact, it is evident that from\na semantic and/or epistemological point of view, he can no longer\njustify the extra-mental reality of universals.\n\nLike Burley, Sharpe\u2019s semantics lists a third kind of expression\nbetween simple and complex expressions: concrete accidental terms\n(like \u2018white\u2019 or \u2018father\u2019), whose\nsignificata are neither simple nor complex objects but\nsomething in between. He affirms that concrete accidental terms do not\nsignify simple objects but aggregates composed of a substance and an\naccidental form. Such aggregates are lacking in numerical unity, and\nhence do not fall into any of the ten categories, because they are not\nproperly beings (entia). For that reason concrete accidental\nterms, although simple expressions from a merely grammatical point of\nview, are not names. The two metaphysical components of such\naggregates (i.e., substance and accidental form) are related to the\nconcrete accidental term as follows: although the concrete accidental\nterm connotes the accidental form, this is not its direct\nsignificatum, so that the concrete accidental term can\nsupposit for the substance only. In other words, the concrete\naccidental terms label substances by means of the accidental forms\nfrom which they draw their names, so that they name substances only\nqua bearers (subiecta) of a form. This fact accounts\nfor the difference between general names in the category of substance\n(like \u2018man\u2019) and concrete accidental terms. General names\nin the category of substance are concrete terms as well, but the form\nthey primarily signify is really identical with the substances they\nlabel. Therefore, in this case, the name itself of the form can be\nused as a name of the substance. This obviously implies a slight\ndifference in meaning between abstract and concrete substantial terms,\nsuch as \u2018humanity\u2019 (\u2018humanitas\u2019) and\n\u2018man\u2019 (\u2018homo\u2019). While\n\u2018humanity\u2019 is not the name of the form considered in its\ntotality, but rather the name only of the essential principle of the\nform, that is, of the intensional content carried by the term\n\u2018man\u2019, this latter term signifies the substantial form\nconsidered as a constitutive element of the reality (esse) of\na certain set of individual substances that instantiate it. As a\nconsequence, according to Sharpe, \u2018man is humanity\u2019\n(\u2018homo est humanitas\u2019) is a well formed and true\nsentence, since both subject and predicate signify the same entity,\nbut \u2018white is whiteness\u2019 (\u2018album est\nalbedo\u2019) is not, since \u2018white\u2019 does not\ndirectly signify the accidental form, but only the substrate in which\nit inheres, as bearer of that form, and therefore \u2018white\u2019\ncannot stand for such a form in any sentence (ibid., pp.\n71\u201373).\n",
