A Brief History of the Topic\n\n\nPhilosophers seem to have been interested in the phenomenon of\ncategory mistakes at least since Aristotle, even if the phenomenon was\nnot explicitly labelled. For example, In Metaphysics Zeta 5, Aristotle\nraises an interesting puzzle concerning the attribute\n\u2018snub\u2019: on the one hand, \u2018snub nose\u2019 seems to\nmean exactly the same thing as \u2018concave nose\u2019 which\nsuggests that \u2018snub\u2019 simply means the same as\n\u2018concave\u2019. On the other hand, this cannot be the entire\nstory because, unlike \u2018concave\u2019, \u2018snub\u2019 can\nonly be felicitously attributed to noses: \u2018concave bowl\u2019,\nfor example, is entirely felicitous while \u2018snub bowl\u2019 is a\n kind of category\n mistake.[1]\n\n\nHowever, it seems fair to trace the contemporary debate on category\nmistakes to the first half of the 20th century, and most\nnotably to the work of Gilbert Ryle (who also coined the term\n\u2018category mistake\u2019). Influenced by the work of Edmund\nHusserl, Ryle argued that category mistakes were the key to delineating\nontological categories: the fact that \u2018Saturday is in bed\u2019\nis a category mistake while \u2018Gilbert Ryle is in bed\u2019 is\nnot, shows that Saturday and Ryle belong to different\n ontological\n categories.[2]\n Moreover, Ryle\nmaintained that distinguishing between categories was the\ncentral task of philosophy: \u201cThe matter is of some importance,\nfor not only is it the case that category-propositions (namely\nassertions that terms belong to certain categories or types), are\nalways philosopher\u2019s propositions, but, I believe, the converse\nis also true. So we are in the dark about the nature of philosophical\nproblems and methods if we are in the dark about types and\ncategories\u201d (Ryle 1938, 189). Section 3.2.1 below\ntreats developments of the view that Ryle\u2019s held, namely, \nthat category  mistakes are grammatical but meaningless.\n\n\nTo see why category distinctions were so important to Ryle, we need\nto look at another major influence: Bertrand Russell. Russell argued\nthat a range of paradoxes (including his famous set-theoretic paradox\nand the Liar paradox) can be solved by restrictions of type. For\nexample, the famous set-theoretic paradox requires considering sets\nthat are (/ are not) members of themselves. However, if \u2018is a\nmember of \\(s\\)\u2019 is a predicate that can only meaningfully\nbe predicated of objects of a certain type which does not include\n\\(s\\) itself, then \u2018\\(s\\) is (/ is not) a member of\n\\(s\\)\u2019 is simply a meaningless sentence, and the paradox\ncannot even be properly expressed. This inspired two related ideas,\nwhich gained further support from the work of Wittgenstein and the\nlogical positivists: first, due to some kind of type confusion,\napparently grammatical sentences might nevertheless be meaningless;\nsecond, apparent philosophical puzzles might be resolved by exposing\ntype confusions and declaring the sentences allegedly stating the\npuzzle meaningless.\n\n\nRyle argued that these ideas should be applied much more widely than\nRussell\u2019s discussion of the paradoxes suggested. The thought was\nthat by recognizing some philosophically puzzling assertions as\ncategory mistakes, one would expose them as meaningless, thus\ndissolving these puzzles altogether. This philosophical methodology saw\nits culmination in The Concept of Mind, in which Ryle declared\nthat the dualistic position and the mind-body problem that it gives\nrise to is \u201cone big mistake and a mistake of a special kind. It\n is, namely, a category\n mistake\u201d.[3]\n The exact relation between these philosophical\nproblems and more paradigmatic cases of category mistakes (sentences\nsuch as \u2018Saturday is in bed\u2019 which Ryle discussed in his\nearlier work) is not entirely clear, but even putting Ryle\u2019s own\napplication of the concept aside, his work on category mistakes\ngenerated a lasting philosophical interest in the phenomenon.\n\n\nSome of the ensuing debates continued the project of attempting to\n demarcate ontological categories using category\n mistakes[4],\n while others focused more directly on\nthe semantic status of category mistakes. In the 1940s and 50s the\northodox view seems to have accepted Ryle\u2019s claim that category\n mistakes are\n meaningless[5],\n so\nmuch so that in his 1954 paper \u2018Entities\u2019 Arthur Prior\ncomplained that anyone who takes category mistakes to be false rather\nthan meaningless \u201cmust nowadays count themselves among the\nheretics\u201d (Prior 1954, 160). Even in that period, this\northodoxy had its dissenters (Prior 1954; Ewing 1937; and Quine\n1960). For example, in Word and Object, Quine criticized the\nview that took category mistakes to be meaningless as \u201cjust a\nspontaneous revulsion against silly sentences\u201d (Quine 1960,\n229). These objectors were primarily focused on refuting the claim that\ncategory mistakes are meaningless and the alleged applications of this\nclaim to metaphysical debates, rather than in offering any positive\naccount of why category mistakes are nevertheless infelicitous.\n\n\nThe 1960s saw a more direct interest in category mistakes as an\nindependently interesting linguistic phenomenon. In 1966 Drange\npublished an entire monograph devoted to the topic (Drange 1966), and\na lively exchange in the Australasian Journal of Philosophy\nfocused on the question of whether category mistakes are truth-valued,\nwith Lambert and Haack supporting the view (labelled \u2018no\ntype\u2019 or \u2018falsidal\u2019) that category mistakes are\ntruth-valued and Brady, Goddard, and Routley arguing that they\n are\n not.[6]\n The period between the\nlate 1960s and the early 1980s saw a series of papers attempting to\naccount for category mistakes using a range of tools from formal logic,\nculminating with the publication of the second monograph devoted to\n category mistakes: Lappin\n (1981).[7] \n However, by the mid-1980s the topic of\ncategory mistakes seemed to have fallen out of fashion: for over twenty\nyears it was by and large neglected in the philosophical literature, at\nleast as a self-standing issue.\n\n\nAlmost entirely divorced from the philosophical debate, category\nmistakes were also extensively discussed in the linguistics literature\n(though almost never under that label\u2014terms used in the\nlinguistic literature for various aspects of the phenomenon include\n\u2018selectional violations\u2019, \u2018selectional\nrestrictions\u2019, \u2018semantic anomaly\u2019 \u2018sortal\npresuppositions\u2019). Here the driving figure of the debate was Noam\nChomsky. In his 1957 monograph Syntactic Structures, Chomsky\nmaintained that the now-famous category mistake \u2018Colorless green\nideas sleep furiously\u2019 is grammatical but meaningless, using this\nclaim to support his contention that syntax is an autonomous field from\nsemantics. The claim was further developed in Fodor & Katz\u2019s\ninfluential paper \u2018The structure of semantic theory\u2019 (Fodor\n& Katz 1963), where they claimed that the ability to recognize\nwhich sentences are \u2018semantically anomalous\u2019 (their term\nfor category mistakes) was a crucial component of linguistic\ncompetence. Moreover, they developed a semantic framework which\npredicted that category mistakes are (grammatical but) meaningless.\nHowever, in his 1965 book Aspects of the Theory of Syntax\nChomsky revised his view of category mistakes, now arguing that they\nare ungrammatical, and offering a syntactic theory which\nrendered them syntactically ill-formed (cf. \u00a73.1). The theory\nfollowed many of the technical details of Fodor and Katz\u2019s\ntheory, but this time treating features they took to be semantic as\nsyntactic.\n\n\nIn the late 1960s category mistakes played a central role in the\nchasm between the followers of Chomsky (whose view was labelled\n\u2018Interpretative Semantics\u2019), and proponents of a new\nmovement in linguistics labelled \u2018Generative Semantics\u2019,\nwhose key proponents were Lakoff, McCawley, Ross, and Postal.\nInterpretative semanticists claimed that sentences were assigned a\nsyntactic structure by an autonomous syntactic module, a structure\nwhich could then be provided as input for semantic interpretation. By\ncontrast, generative semanticists eschewed the sharp distinction\nbetween syntax and semantics, maintaining that the structure of a\nsentence was determined by a combination of so-called syntactic,\nsemantic, and pragmatic considerations. In particular, they labelled\ninfelicitous sentences such as category mistakes as simply\n\u2018ill-formed\u2019, resisting the attempt to pin down the precise\n source of the\n ill-formedness.[8]\n\n\nAs in philosophy, by the 1980s dedicated discussions of the\nphenomenon of category mistakes seemed to have died out, although the\nconcept is still routinely mentioned in passing, especially in\nintroductory text-books. The standard view seems to be that category\nmistakes are \u2018semantically anomalous\u2019 or\n\u2018semantically ill-formed\u2019. It is not entirely clear what\nthese labels amount to, but most likely they indicate the view, which\nseems to be accepted by the majority of linguists these days, that\ncategory mistakes are grammatical but meaningless.\n\n\nHowever, since the early 2000s, the topic of category mistakes has\nbeen experiencing a small revival in both philosophy and linguistics\n(with the division between those two fields no longer\n being\n sharp).[9]\n",
