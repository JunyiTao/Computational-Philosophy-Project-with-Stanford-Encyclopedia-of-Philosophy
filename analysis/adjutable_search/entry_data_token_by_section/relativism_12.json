    "main_text": "A Brief History of an Old Idea\n3. A Brief History of an Old Idea\nThe English term \u201crelativism\u201d came into usage only in the 19th Century. John Grote was probably the first to employ it when in Exploratio Philosophica (1865) he wrote:\n\nThe notion of the mask over the face of nature is\u2026. what I have called \u201crelativism\u201d. If \u201cthe face of nature\u201d is reality, then the mask over it, which is what theory gives us, is so much deception, and that is what relativism really comes to. (Grote 1865: I.xi, 229).\n\nIts German counterpart, \u201cRelativismus\u201d, has a longer history. Wilhelm Traugott Krug, who succeeded Kant in the University of K\u00f6nigsberg in his philosophical lexicon, defines it as\n\nthe assumption that everything which we experience and think (the self, the idea of reason, truth, morality, religion etc.) is only something relative, and therefore has no essential endurance and no universal validity. (Krug 2010 [1838]: 224)\n\nAlthough the term \u201crelativism\u201d is of recent coinage, doctrines and positions, with some of the hallmarks of contemporary relativism, date back to the very beginnings of Western philosophy. Protagoras of Abdera (c. 490\u2013420 BC) is often considered the first overt champion of relativism, and his dictum\n\nMan (anthr\u00f4pos) is the measure (metron) of all things (chr\u00eamat\u00f4n), of the things which are, that they are, and of the things which are not, that they are not (t\u00f4n men ont\u00f4n h\u00f4s esti, t\u00f4n de m\u00ea ont\u00f4n h\u00f4s ouk estin) (from Plato\u2019s Theaetetus 152a 2\u20134)\n\nits first battle-cry. According to Plato, Protagoras thought:\n\nEach thing appears (phainesthai) to me, so it is for me, and as it appears to you, so it is for you\u2014you and I each being a man. (Theaetetus 152a 6\u20138)\n\nFor instance, the same wind could be cold to one person and hot to another. The extent to which Protagoras\u2019s view, or at least what comes down to us from Plato, amounts to genuine relativism remains somewhat controversial. As Burnyeat (1976b: 172) notes, Sextus Empiricus thought\u2014though Burnyeat thinks mistakenly\u2014that the Protagorean measure doctrine was to be understood as the subjectivist thesis that every appearance is true (simpliciter). This kind of radical subjectivism, though, quickly can be shown to turn on itself: it can appear that the thesis that \u201cevery appearance is true\u201d is false. And so this radical subjectivist interpretation, regardless of whether it is accurate, is as Sextus had thought, untenable. However, Plato also ascribes a social or ethical dimension to Protagorean relativism which seem to go beyond individualistic subjectivism. In Theaetetus 172a 2\u20136 he says\n\nwhat may or may not fittingly be done, of just and unjust, of what is sanctioned by religion and what is not; and here the theory may be prepared to maintain that whatever view a city takes on these matters and establishes as its law or convention, is truth and fact for that city. In such matters, neither any individual nor any city can claim superior wisdom. [emphasis added]\n\nPlato\u2019s attempted refutation of Protagoras, known as peritrope or \u201cturning around\u201d, is the first of the many attempts to show that relativism is self-refuting.\nProtagorean relativism directly influenced the Pyrrhonian Skeptics, who saw the \u201cman is the measure\u201d doctrine as a precursor to their brand of skepticism. Sextus Empiricus, for instance, in his \u201cRelativity Mode\u201d states that judgments and observations are relative to the person who makes them, to their context as well as the object being observed and goes on to say,\n\nsince we have established in this way that everything is relative (pros ti), it is clear then that we shall not be able to say what an existing object is like in its own nature and purely, but only what it appears to be like relative to something. (Sextus Empiricus PH I 140)\n\nBut the conclusion he draws favors skepticism rather than relativism as understood in modern philosophy, for he concludes, \u201cIt follows that we must suspend judgment about the nature of objects\u201d (ibid.).\nGlimpses of relativistic thinking were in evidence in Boethius (480\u2013524) (see Marenbon 2003) as well as in the double truth doctrine, or the view that religion and philosophy are separate and at times conflicting sources of truth, originally found in Averroes (1126\u20131198) and the 13th century Latin Averroists. However, the dominant belief in a singular and absolute revealed truth within a Christian framework, on the whole, made the medieval period inhospitable to relativism. There was a renewed interest in both relativism and skepticism at the inception of modern philosophy inspired, in part, by Latin translations of Sextus Empiricus in the 16th century. Michel de Montaigne\u2019s work (1533\u20131592), in common with others sympathetic towards relativism, ancient or contemporary, relies on accounts of faraway cultures to argue that \u201cwe have no other criterion of truth or right-reason than the example and form of the opinion and customs of our own country\u201d (Montaigne 1580 [1991: 152]) (but also see Fricker 2013 for a dissenting view). His advocacy of toleration, even for the cannibal, paved the way for not only the acceptance but the valorization of idealized versions of alien creeds and distant cultures by Enlightenment figures such as Rousseau (1712\u20131778), Voltaire (1694\u20131778), Diderot (1713\u20131784), Montesquieu (1689\u20131755) and Condorcet (1743\u20131794), who in turn, were instrumental in establishing an intellectual climate hospitable to cultural relativism. These authors were also the first to explore the idea of viewing one\u2019s culture from an outsider\u2019s point of view and using this external perspective as a vehicle to criticize local customs and norms. To take just one example, Diderot, in his \u201cSupplement to the Voyage of Bougainville\u201d, tells us that the Tahitian is mild, innocent, and happy while civilized people are corrupt, vile, and wretched; the natives live according to customs and rules that vary greatly from the Western ones. They do not possess private property or operate their affairs based on egalitarian principles, and they exercise sexual freedom not accepted in \u201ccivilized societies\u201d. Diderot accordingly opposes the European mission of civilizing the natives, and despite his belief in a common human nature, he advocates the relativistic sounding maxim to\n\nbe monks in France and savages in Tahiti. Put on the costume of the country you visit, but keep the suit of clothes you will need to go home in. (Diderot 1956 [1772]: 228 in Baghramian 2010: 37)\n\nDiscussions of relativism in the 19th century had two sources (see Gardiner 1981). On the one hand, figures from the so-called Counter-Enlightenment, a philosophical movement which arose in the late 18th century and the early 19th century in opposition to the Enlightenment, Johann Georg Hamann (1730\u20131788), Johann Gottfried Herder (1744\u20131803), Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767\u20131835) emphasized the diversity of languages and customs and their role in shaping human thought. Hamann\u2019s views on language, for instance, foreshadow contemporary conceptual and epistemic relativism. He maintained that language is the \u201cinstrument and criterion of reason\u201d as well as the source of all the confusions and fallacies of reason. Furthermore, the rules of rationality are embedded within language, which in turn, is governed by local norms of custom and use (Hamann 1967 [1759]). Relativism ensues because languages and their rules of rationality vary a great deal. Herder, on the other hand, not only railed against the rational, universalizing and science-oriented ethos of the Enlightenment but, much like later relativists, also argued that different nations and epochs have their distinct preferences in ethical and aesthetics matters as well as their varied conceptions of truth and we are not in a position to adjudicate between them (Herder 1774 [2002: 272\u2013358]).\nThe Counter Enlightenment had a significant influence on Hegel, Nietzsche, and Dilthey, who in turn have shaped relativistic thinking in certain strands of continental philosophy, postmodernism and cultural studies. Hamann\u2019s rejection of objectivism was central to Nietzsche\u2019s even more profound recoil from objectivity. And indeed, Nietzsche is possibly the single most influential voice in shaping relativistic sensibilities in 20th century continental philosophy. His declaration that all human conceptions and descriptions, including those advanced by scientists, are\n\nonly an interpretation and arrangement of the world (according to our own requirements, if I may say so!)\u2014and not an explanation of the world. (Nietzsche 1886a [1996]: \u00a714)\n\nand that \u201cthere is only a perspective seeing, only a perspective knowing\u201d (Nietzsche 1886b [1968]: \u00a7540), irrespective of how Nietzsche himself intended them, have been taken to express a core contention of relativism that no single account of truth or reality can occupy a privileged position, for such accounts are only one of many perspectives that prevail at a given time in history. We cannot appeal to any facts or standards of evaluation independently of their relation to the perspectives available to us; we can do little more than to insist on the legitimacy of our own perspective and try to impose it on other people through our \u201cwill to power\u201d.\nA second source was the German post-Kantian and British Idealist discussions of the \u201crelativity of knowledge\u201d taking place in the context of the distinction between being-for-other (f\u00fcr anderes sein) and being-for-itself (f\u00fcrsichsein)\u2014a distinction influenced by the Kantian idea that all knowledge is ultimately relational because knowledge of the Real or \u201cthe thing in itself\u201d is impossible. John Stuart Mill, for instance ascribes to the Kantian William Hamilton the \u201cdoctrine of relativity of our human knowledge\u201d because Hamilton, according to Mill, believed that there could be no unconditional or absolute knowledge for all knowledge is dependent on the knowing mind (Mill 1884: 8).\nThe end of the 19th century witnessed the emergence of yet another strand of relativism motivated by empirical-psychological and physiological interpretations of Kantian categories. The view, known as species relativism, and defended by neo-Kantian psychologists such as Theodore Lipps (1851\u20131914), holds that the rules of logic are products of the human mind and psychology and therefore may be unique to the human species; different species could have and use different logical principles. The view was vehemently, but quite effectively, attacked by Frege and Husserl as part of their arguments against what they called \u201cpsychologism\u201d and \u201cspeciesism\u201d (Kusch 1995: 47). Logic in this approach is identified with the actual thinking processes of individuals or communities and its authority is seen to be local, or relative to the practices of particular epistemic groupings. But Frege and Husserl argued that with such relativization we would lose the ability to distinguish between reasoning correctly and merely seeming to do so.\nFinally, the popularity of the very idea of relativism in the 20th century owes something to Einstein\u2019s Special Theory of Relativity (1905) which was to be used both as model and as well as a vindication for various relativistic claims. Gilbert Harman is among the philosophers to use Einsteinian relativity as a model for philosophical versions of relativism. He says:\n\nAccording to Einstein\u2019s Theory of Relativity even an object\u2019s mass is relative to a choice of spatio-temporal framework. An object can have one mass in relation to one such framework and a different mass in relation to another. \u2026. I am going to argue for a similar claim about moral right and wrong. \u2026 I am going to argue that moral right and wrong \u2026. are always relative to a choice of moral framework. (Harman 1996: 3)\n\nThe Sapir-Whorf theory of linguistic relativity (see \u00a74.1) is also thought to have been inspired by the Relativity Theory. It is however worth noting that Einstein did not think that the Theory of Relativity supported relativism in ethics or epistemology because, although in his model simultaneity and sameness of place are relative to reference frames, the physical laws expressing such relativity are constant and universal and hence in no sense relative.\nThe different strands of the intellectual genealogy of relativism have shaped a variety of relativistic doctrines.\n",
