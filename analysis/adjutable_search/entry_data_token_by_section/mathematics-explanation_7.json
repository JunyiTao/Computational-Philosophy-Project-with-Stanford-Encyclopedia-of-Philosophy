But what\ndistinguishes a proof that explains from one that doesn\u2019t? How\nshould one proceed in providing an account of explanatory proofs? It\nis here that two possibilities emerge. On the one hand, one can follow\na top-down approach where one starts with a general model of\nexplanatory proof and then tries to see how well it accounts for the\npractice. On the other hand, one can embrace a bottom-up approach\nwhere one begins by avoiding, as much as possible, any commitment to a\nparticular theoretical framework. Only afterwards, one attempts to\nprovide a taxonomy of recurrent types of mathematical explanatory\nproofs and tries to see whether these patterns are heterogeneous or\ncan be subsumed under a general account.\n\nSupporters of the bottom-up approach include Hafner and Mancosu\n(2005), Mancosu (2008) and Lange (2015b, 2015c, 2017, 2018b). Probably\nthe main characteristic of their investigations is the extremely rich\nand varied set of examples considered; precisely in virtue of this\nvariety, Lange argues that there is no general pattern characterizing\nexplanatory proofs; at most one can claim that there are different\nclasses of explanatory proofs. Lange proposes several salient features\nof mathematical theorems, which (in different contexts) are\nresponsible (in those contexts) for the distinction between\nexplanatory and non-explanatory proofs. Among them, he discusses\nextensively symmetry and simplicity. As for simplicity, it amounts to\nthe requirement for a proof of a simple result \u201cexploits some\nsimilar, simple feature of the setup\u201d (see Lange 2017, 257). As\nfor symmetry, it is a property that arises when dealing with\nmathematical results that display some striking symmetry: for the\nproof to count as explanatory, it needs to show how such symmetry\nfollows from a similar symmetry in the set-up of the problem. Lange\ndefends these properties by using cases studies drawn from\nprobability, real analysis, number theory, complex numbers and\ngeometry, among other areas of mathematics. One of the most\nrepresentative (see Lange 2017, 239\u2013242) is the proof of\nd\u2019Alembert\u2019s theorem to the effect that in a polynomial\nequation of n-th degree in the variable x and having\nonly real coefficients, the nonreal roots always come in pairs (any\nnon-real root and its complex conjugate will both satisfy the\nequation). What explains this symmetry? A non-explanatory proof can be\ngiven by algebraic manipulations but this does not reveal the reason\nfor the result which, according to Lange, is the fact that the axioms\nof complex arithmetic are invariant under substitution of i\nfor -i. Bueno and Vivanco (2019) points out that it is\nunclear why what Lange isolates as the symmetric feature of the proof\n(which makes it explanatory) is a symmetry at all. They suggest that\nthis proof turns on an appropriate feature of the relevant\nstructure.\n\nOther instances of the bottom-up approach may be found in Paseau\n(2010), Arana & Mancosu (2012), Colyvan, Cusberg & McQueen\n(2018), D\u2019Alessandro (2021) and Ryan (2021). Each article\nconsiders an aspect of mathematical practice and tries to address it\non its own terms.\n\nTop-down approaches take their start from a general theory of\nmathematical explanation and then explore how well the practice fits\nthe model. A typical example of a top-down approach in mathematical\nexplanation is Kitcher\u2019s unificationist theory, to be discussed\nbelow. But one can also apply this description to overarching views on\nthe nature of explanation. While there are several examples one could\nmention, here we present an influential proposal that finds its origin\nin Kim (1994). In order to classify the different accounts of\nscientific explanation Kim uses the contraposition between\n\u2018explanatory internalism\u2019 and \u2018explanatory\nexternalism.\u2019 Whereas for \u2018explanatory internalism\u2019\nexplanations are activities internal to an epistemic corpus (a theory\nor set of beliefs), an \u2018explanatory externalist\u2019 will look\nfor some systematic pattern of objective dependence relations which\nexplanations track or can be identified with. We divide the present\nsection in two subsections that follow this division: one will be\ndedicated to the presentation of the externalist, or ontic, accounts\nof explanatory mathematical proofs, while the other to the\ninternalist, or epistemic, ones. Among the externalist accounts, we\nwill discuss Steiner\u2019s theory, several counterfactual theories\nof mathematical explanation, and some other proposals. Among\ninternalist accounts we will discuss Kitcher\u2019s theory, together\nwith two novel ones proposed by Frans (2021) and Inglis &\nMeji\u0301a-Ramos (2019).\n2.2.1 Externalist models of mathematical explanation\n\nAmongst the several existing contemporary externalist models of\nexplanatory proofs, the oldest and probably most well-known is\nSteiner\u2019s account. Steiner aims at finding criteria that could\ncharacterize explanatory proofs. After having discussed several\npossible criteria, such as abstractness, generality, and\nvisualizability, Steiner rejects them all in favor of the idea that\n\u201cto explain the behavior of an entity, one deduces the behavior\nfrom the essence or nature of the entity\u201d (Steiner 1978a, 143).\nAlthough such an idea could seem prima facie intuitive and\ninteresting, it turns out to be quite problematic. First, it leads to\nthe notorious difficulties linked to the concepts of essence or\nessential property; moreover, such concepts risk having little\ntraction in a mathematical context since all mathematical truths are\nregarded as necessary. Hence, instead of talking of\n\u201cessence,\u201d Steiner speaks of \u201ccharacterizing\nproperties\u201d by which he means \u201ca property unique to a\ngiven entity or structure within a family or domain of such entities\nor structures,\u201d where he takes the notion of a family as\nundefined. In other words, for Steiner the difference between\nexplanatory and non-explanatory proofs lies in the characterizing\nproperties, which are found only in the former but not by the latter.\nHowever, this is not all: an explanatory proof needs to be\ngeneralizable as well. Varying the relevant feature (and hence a\ncertain characterizing property) in such a proof needs to give rise to\nan array of corresponding theorems, which are proved \u2013 and\nexplained \u2013 by an array of \u201cdeformations\u201d of the\noriginal proof.\n\nThere have been two extensive critical discussions of Steiner\u2019s\naccount. The first was provided by Resnik and Kushner (1987) who\nargued that the distinction between explanatory and non-explanatory\nproofs is context-dependent. The second, which also offers a\ncounterexample to the theory based on a case of explanation from real\nanalysis recognized as such in mathematical practice, has been\ndeveloped by Hafner and Mancosu (2005). There have also been attempts\nto improve Steiner\u2019s model. The work developed by Weber and\nVerhoeven (2002) can for example be seen as an attempt to improve\nSteiner\u2019s notion of deformation. Indeed, while Steiner suggests\nthat explanation concerns an array of related proofs and theorems,\nalthough maintaining that each proof is an explanation of the\nindividual theorem, Weber and Verhoeven (2002) start with what makes\npairs of proofs \u2013 P1 and P2 \u2013 count as explanatory. In\nparticular, they focus on explaining why, while a certain class of\nobject \\(x\\) has a property \\(Q\\) (proof P1), another class of objects\n\\(y\\) enjoys property Q\u2019 (proof P2). Here P1 and P2 use the same\naxioms and the same logical rules, but while P1 uses a characterizing\nproperty of \\(x\\), but not of \\(y\\), P2 uses a characterizing property\nof \\(y\\), but not of \\(x\\). A final attempt to enrich Steiner\u2019s\naccount is proposed by Salverda (2017) who tries to adapt this\napproach to an internalist perspective on explanations of the sort\ndiscussed in section 2.2.2.\n\nIn the field of causal explanations, a dominant perspective has been\nformulated in counterfactual terms. Although there has long been a\nresistance in the use of counterfactuals to account for explanations\nin mathematics (see Lange 2017, 88, 2022), many authors adopt this\napproach, perhaps due to the attractiveness of a unified theory of\nexplanation that promises to hold in both causal and non-causal\ncontexts. \n\nAccording to a counterfactual account, the evaluation of whether a\nmathematical fact \\(F\\) explains another mathematical fact \\(G\\) boils\ndown to the evaluation of the following two counterfactuals:\n\nCF1:\n if \\(F\\) had not been the case, \\(G\\) would not have been the\ncase,\n\n\nCF2:\n if \\(G\\) had not been the case, \\(F\\) would not have been the\ncase.\n\n\nThe first counterfactual, CF1, needs to be true: it directly accounts\nfor the explanatory power of the relation between \\(F\\) and \\(G\\). By\ncontrast, the second counterfactual, CF2, needs to be false since it\nserves to ensure that the relation between \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) is\nasymmetric, i.e., it shows that it is not the case that \\(G\\) explains\n\\(F\\).\n\nOnce the counterfactuals are specified, a theory for counterfactuals\nneeds to make clear what truth-conditional account of counterfactuals\nis adopted. Here (at least) two options naturally emerge. On the one\nhand, one can evaluate a counterfactual using possible worlds\nsemantics; for example, Lewis\u2019s closeness-based semantics, which\ntrivializes for mathematical counterfactuals (see Lewis 1973, and\nStalnaker 1968), has recently been extended to avoid these\ntrivialities (see for example Nolan 2001 and Priest 2002). This\nextension, which considers both possible and impossible words, can be\nused to evaluate the truth value of counterfactuals CF1 and CF2. On\nthe other hand, one can also try to adapt the standard tools of\nstructural equation modelling (see Pearl 2000) to evaluate the truth\nvalue of CF1 and CF2. In this case, one interprets mathematical facts\nas variables which can either take the value 1 or the value 0,\naccording to whether the propositions they represent are either true\nor false. While the variable that denotes \\(F\\) is an\nexogenous variable \u2013 its values are determined by\nfactors outside the model \u2013 the variable that denotes \\(G\\) is\nendogenous \u2013 its values are determined by the value of\nother variable(s), in our case \\(F\\). In order to test whether the\ncounterfactual CF1 is true, one needs to intervene on the\nvalue of the variable assigned to \\(F\\) and check whether this change\naffects the value of the variable assigned to \\(G\\). As for the truth\nvalue of CF2, its falsity, and thus the asymmetry required by the\nexplanatory relation, is built into the nature of endogenous\nvariable.\n\nBoth Reutlinger et al. (2022) and Baron et al. (2020) support a\ncounterfactual theory of explanation that is mainly discussed in the\npossible worlds\u2019 semantics framework. More precisely, while\nReutlinger et al. defends the value of a monist theory of explanation,\nBaron et al. (2020) exemplify the counterfactual approach to\nmathematical explanations with a real case of explanatory proof.\n\nGijsbers (2017) develops a counterfactual account of explanatory\nproofs which relies on the structural equation framework, but where\nthe notion of \u201cintervention\u201d \u00e0 la Woodward (2003),\ncannot be employed in the mathematical context. As Woodward\nemphasizes, an intervention is a causal change to the value of a\nvariable. Instead Gijsbers introduces the idea of a\n\u201cquasi-interventionist\u201d theory of mathematical\nexplanation: in this theory, quasi-interventions reveal asymmetries\nwhich are inherent not in the mathematical proofs, but in the\nmathematical practice (see Gijsbers, 2017, 59). In other words,\nasymmetries are no longer accounted for in an objective, but rather in\na more subjective way that is tied to the features of the practice in\nquestion.\n\nIn a sense Gijsbers\u2019 model is complementary to the one proposed\nby Frans and Weber (2014). Indeed, while Gijsbers accounts for the\nexplanatory power of proofs in counterfactual terms, without using the\nnotion of intervention, Frans and Weber account for the explanatory\npower of proofs with a mechanistic model of explanation that directly\ngeneralizes on Woodward\u2019s notion of an intervention.\n\nThe use of counterfactuals to model mathematical explanations has been\ncriticized by Kasirzadeh (2021) and Lange (2022). While Kasirzadeh\nquestions whether the explanans of an explanatory proof can be\nmeaningfully varied in a mathematical context, as the counterfactual\naccounts would require, Lange argues instead that the counterfactual\naccount is rather threatened by the existence of too many\nnon-trivially true countermathematicals. Both Kasirzadeh and Lange\nemphasize that the capacity to answer\nwhat-if-things-had-been-different questions does not correlate with\nexplanatory power in mathematics. Finally, note that also in Jansson\n(2018) one might find criticisms on the use of the structural\nequations\u2019 framework to model dependence relations other than\ncausation, and thus arguably also dependence relations in a\nmathematical context.\n\nNot all externalist models for mathematical explanations are\nmodifications of Steiner\u2019s theory or conveyed in counterfactual\nterms. Pincock (2015b) for example proposes to classify a proof as\nexplanatory when it invokes more abstract kind of entities than the\ntopic of the theorem it proves. Wilhelm (2021) and Poggiolesi\n(forthcoming) contain different proposals for the analysis of\nexplanatory proofs that are similar in perspective to Pincock\u2019s\napproach. In their cases the determination of the explanatory power of\ndifferent proofs requires a formalization of the proofs in logical\nsystems. While for Wilhelm the explanatory power of a proof comes from\nthe balance between the simplicity and the depth of the formalized\nproof, Poggiolesi distinguishes an explanatory proof from a\nnon-explanatory one in that only in the (formalized version of the)\nformer one can witness an increase of conceptual complexity from the\nassumptions to the theorem the proof aims to establish.\n\n2.2.2 Internalist models of mathematical explanation\n\nIn a paper of 1974, Friedman posed a challenge for any coherent\naccount of scientific, and thus presumably also mathematical,\nexplanation: he argued that any such account needed to show how\nexplanation generates understanding. \u201cI don\u2019t see how the\nphilosopher of science can afford to ignore such concepts as\n\u2018understanding\u2019 and \u2018intelligibility\u2019 when\ngiving a theory of the explanation relation\u201d (Friedman 1974, 8).\nWhile externalist, or ontic, accounts do not directly concern\nthemselves with Friedman\u2019s challenge, they do not deny the link\nbetween explanation and understanding. However, they simply do not\npose understanding as a defining characteristic of explanation. By\ncontrast, internalist, or epistemic, accounts are those which directly\naddress this challenge.\n\nIn the philosophy of science, one of the main conceptions of\nscientific understanding is the unificationist model which argues that\nexplanations provide understanding by unifying different phenomena.\nAlthough the idea is undoubtedly intuitively appealing, the key\nquestion is whether the notion of unification can be made more precise\nso that we can distinguish between what an explanation is and what is\nnot. Friedman (1974) is an early attempt to do this, although his\nformulation was quickly shown to suffer from several technical\nproblems (see Kitcher 1976). Kitcher is, on the other hand, the main\nsupporter of the unificationist approach. His proposal consists in\nlooking at unification as the reduction of the number of argument\npatterns used in providing explanations while being as comprehensive\nas possible in the number of phenomena explained:\n\nUnderstanding the phenomena is not simply a matter of reducing the\n\u201cfundamental incomprehensibilities\u201d but of seeing\nconnections, common patterns, in what initially appeared to be\ndifferent situations. Here the switch in conception from premise\nconclusion pairs to derivations proves vital. Science advances our\nunderstanding of nature by showing us how to derive descriptions of\nmany phenomena, using the same patterns of derivation again and again,\nand, in demonstrating this, it teaches us how to reduce the number of\ntypes of facts that we have to accept as ultimate (or brute). So the\ncriterion of unification I shall try to articulate will be based on\nthe idea that E(K) is a set of derivations that makes the best\ntradeoff between minimizing the number of patterns of derivation\nemployed and maximizing the number of conclusions generated. (Kitcher\n1989, 432)\n\n\nLet us make this a little bit more formal. Let us start with a set K\nof beliefs assumed to be consistent and deductively closed (informally\none can think of this as a set of statements endorsed by an ideal\nscientific community at a specific moment in time; Kitcher 1981, 75).\nA systematization of K is any set of arguments that derive some\nsentences in K from other sentences of K. The explanatory store over\nK, E(K), is the best systematization of K (Kitcher here makes an\nidealization by claiming that E(K) is unique). Corresponding to\ndifferent systematizations we have different degrees of unification.\nThe highest degree of unification is that given by E(K). But according\nto what criteria can a systematization be judged to be the best? There\nare three factors: the number of patterns, the stringency of the\npatterns, and the set of consequences derivable from the\nunification.\n\nTwo remarks are in order when it comes to Kitcher\u2019s proposal.\nFirst, his account of theoretical unification is mainly thought of for\nthe general question of scientific explanation, although he sees as\none of the virtues of his viewpoint to be extendable to mathematics as\nwell. Secondly, Kitcher\u2019s model is not meant to address the\nlocal question of what distinguishes an explanatory proof from one\nthat does not explain (as all other accounts do); it rather provides a\nnovel perspective on the global question of how to systemize a whole\nbody of knowledge that has explanatory value. The application of\nKitcher\u2019s model to explanatory proofs has been explored in two\nopposite directions. On the one hand, Hafner and Mancosu (2008) tested\nKitcher\u2019s model with three different methods to prove theorems\nabout real closed fields (see Brumfiel 1979); the authors showed that\nthe model makes predictions about the explanatory power of these\nmethods which contradicts judgments coming from the mathematical\npractice (See also Pincock 2015b). On the other hand, Frans (2021) not\nonly reassesses the value of unificatory understanding, which it is a\ntype of explanatory understanding, for mathematics; additionally, he\nshows through a plethora of different examples, ranging from\nPythagoras\u2019 theorem to the theorem that states that sum of the\nfirst n integers equals n(n+1)/2, that proofs can contribute to\nunificatory understanding. \n\nA novel internalist account has recently been proposed by Inglis and\nMeji\u0301a-Ramos (2019), who apply Wilkenfeld\u2019s functional\nmodel of understanding (see Wilkenfeld (2014)) to the mathematical\ncase. Wilkenfield\u2019s approach consists in reversing\nFriedman\u2019s perspective: while Friedman demanded that\nphilosophers clarify how explanations, suitably defined, generate\nunderstanding, Wilkenfield defines explanations as those things that\ngenerate understanding. By doing so, Wilkenfield moves the burden of\nclarification from the notion of explanation to that of understanding\nand how it is generated: this move \u2013 he argues\n\u2013 has recently become tenable as philosophical accounts of\nunderstanding have become more and more sophisticated. \n\nIn Inglis & Meji\u0301a-Ramos (2019) the conception of\nunderstanding adopted is that of Kelp (2016), along with a modal\nmodel of the generation of understanding (see Atkinson and\nShiffrin 1968). With these two elements at hand, Inglis &\nMeji\u0301a-Ramos identify three properties that any mathematical\nexplanatory proof is likely to have: (i) an explanatory proof would\ndirect the reader\u2019s attention to its conceptually important\nsection; (ii) it would reorganize the new and existing information\ninto coherent new schema; (iii) it would reduce the chances of working\nmemory capacity to be exceeded.\n\nOther internalist accounts of explanatory proof have been developed by\nDelarivi\u00e8re, Frans & Kerkhove (2017), Dutilh Novaes (2018),\nand Lehet (2021).\n",
