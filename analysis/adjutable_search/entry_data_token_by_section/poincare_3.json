    "main_text": "Philosophy of mathematics || Geometry: conventions, intuition and aesthetics\n3.2 Geometry: conventions, intuition and aesthetics\n\nPoincar\u00e9 was strongly influenced by and attuned to the French\nphilosophical scene, which refers to the Kantian tradition to show the\nlimits of methodological positivism. Members of the so-called\nCritique de la science movement (Benrubi 1928), which\nincludes members of the \u201cBoutroux Circle\u201d (Nye 1979)\nadvocate a mixture of positivism and Neo-Kantianism. They criticize\nboth Comte\u2019s determinism and Kant\u2019s static view of the\nmind\u2019s structure. According to Poincar\u00e9, mathematics\nrequires intuition not only in the context of discovery but also in\nthe context of justification, especially in arithmetic and logic. So\nit is not surprising that Poincar\u00e9 was discussed in German\nphilosophical circles in the Kantian tradition, for example by Ernst\nCassirer (1910), Ilse Rosenthal-Schneider (1914), who is a disciple of\nAlois Rhiel, and Moritz Schlick (1918). Thus, Poincar\u00e9 was\ntaken to be one of the Neo-Kantian precursors of logical positivism.\nHowever, unlike Kant, the arithmetical \u201cpure intuition\u201d\nPoincar\u00e9 introduces is intellectual in character and\nPoincar\u00e9 does not in the least solve the problem of the unity\nof spontaneity and receptivity by the introduction of a pure\nsensibility. Rather, he changes the terms of the Kantian contrast,\nemphasizing the balance between exactness, that which is common to\nmany minds and is transmissible by discourse, and subjective\nacquaintance, which is intransmissible sensation. He expresses this\ndifficult balance in a formula well known due to its popularization by\nEinstein:\n\n\nwhat they [mathematics] have gained in rigor, they have lost in\nobjectivity. It is by distancing themselves from reality that they\nacquired this perfect purity. (Poincar\u00e9 1908: 131; 1913b:\n435)\n\n\nBecause of his concern for the application of mathematics,\nPoincar\u00e9 did not confine himself to the perfect purity of\nmathematics.\n\nThe existence of relatively consistent non-Euclidean geometries leads\nhim to the view that geometric propositions cannot be determined by\na priori intuitions and that it is necessary to study\n\u201cthe structural relations between Euclidean and non-Euclidean\ngeometry\u201d (Nye 1979: 111). Poincar\u00e9 established a famous\ndictionary translating concepts and propositions of\nLobachevskii\u2019s geometry into Euclidean geometry in order to\ncreate a model to show the relative consistency of\nLobachevskii\u2019s geometry (Poincar\u00e9 1891: 771; cf. 1902:\n68; 2017: 37). Concerning pure and applied geometry,\nPoincar\u00e9 holds the modernist-sounding views that we have no\npre-axiomatic understanding of geometric primitives, that rigor\ndemands that we eliminate appeals to intuition in geometry, and that\n(metric) geometry is neither true nor false, not only because we\ncannot verify which one is true, but also because we cannot\nempirically determine the metric geometry of space \u2018in\nprinciple.\u2019 When we speak of space, all we can talk about is the\nrelations of physical bodies:\n\n\n[B]ecause of the relativity and passivity of space, they will not\ndepend on the absolute position and orientation of the system. In\nother words, the state of the bodies and their mutual distances at a\ngiven instant will depend only on the state of these same bodies and\ntheir mutual distances at the initial instant, but will in no way\ndepend on the initial absolute position and initial absolute\norientation of the system. For brevity\u2019s sake, this is what I\nmight call the law of relativity. [\u2026] [S]uch a\nstatement is independent of any interpretation of the experiments. If\nthe law is true in the Euclidean interpretation, it will also be true\nin the non-Euclidean interpretation (Poincar\u00e9 1902:\n98\u201399; 2017: 61\u201362).\n\n\nAlthough distinguishing in 1903 the n-dimensional\n\u201crepresentative space\u201d, which is a physical continuum,\nfrom the geometrical space, which is a mathematical continuum\n(Poincar\u00e9 1905b: chap. IV),  Poincar\u00e9 always held a\nrelationalist view of space that goes further than current space-time\ntheories allow (Stump 1989; Walter 2010). \n\nSince Poincar\u00e9 so profoundly modifies the traditional view of\ngeometry as the a priori science of space, authors such as\nSchlick, Carnap, and Ernest Nagel (1939, 1979) attribute to him a\nleading role in the development of the formal conception of\nmathematics. Alberto Coffa extends Nagel\u2019s analysis by claiming\nthat there was a crisis in the interpretation of primitive geometrical\nterms in the nineteenth century that led to the development of formal\naxiomatic systems (Coffa 1986). References to a central role played by\nPoincar\u00e9 can also be found in Joan Richards\u2019 survey\n(Richards 1994) and in Jeremy Gray\u2019s account of the development\nof modernism (Gray 2008). The modernist character of\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s approach is also shown by the fact that he\nmust be ranked with Duhem among those forerunners of logical\nempiricism who survive Quine\u2019s criticism of the movement, not\nprimarily for his holistic thesis concerning theory-confirmation, more\nso for his conception of geometrical conventions as a kind of hybrid\nanalytic-synthetic expressions \u201cguided\u201d by experience and\nfor his ontological \u201crelationalism\u201d which in certain\naspects comes close to Quine\u2019s doctrine. Both attempt to account\nphilosophically for the incompleteness of (scientific) objects.\n\nPoincar\u00e9 argues that\n\n\ncontrary to the naive dogmatists\u2019 view, that which science\ncaptures are not the things themselves, but simply relationships\nbetween them. Beyond these relations, there is no knowable reality\n(1902: 25; 2017: 2).\n\n\nThus, he rejects metaphysical realism:\n\n\nNo, beyond doubt a reality completely independent of the mind which\nconceives it, sees or feels it, is an impossibility. A world as\nexterior as that, even if it existed, would for us be forever\ninaccessible (Poincar\u00e9 1905b: 23; 1913b: 209)\n\n\nAlthough Quine\u2019s argument (\u201cno entity without\nidentity\u201d) finds a different motivation in a logical context\nquite distant from that of Poincar\u00e9\u2019s, the result is\nsimilar. For Quine, mathematical objects are \u201cknown only by\ntheir laws\u201d and any other properties that they may have are\nirrelevant (Quine 1969: 44).\n\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s geometrical conventions and his ontological\nrelationalism are nothing more than two different aspects of his\nstructural approach, as can be seen by considering two parallel\ndebates at the turn of the 20th century on the nature of\ngeometry\u2014one between Henri Poincar\u00e9 and Bertrand Russell\nand the other between David Hilbert and Gottlob Frege. Poincar\u00e9\nand Hilbert argue for a new conception of geometrical systems, while\nFrege and Russell defend a traditional way of looking at these\nsystems. The debate takes up the questions: Which geometry is true?\nWhat is the nature of definitions and axioms? To deal with the\nmultiplicity of geometries, questions about their truth, and the\nmeaning of their primitive terms, Poincar\u00e9 and Hilbert propose\na radically new view of geometry. They hold that all that we can say\nabout the meaning of \u2018point\u2019, \u2018straight line\u2019,\n\u2018distance\u2019, etc. is that which we have stated in the\naxioms or principles of the system, and that geometry is not a set of\ntruths about some previously known objects. Thus Poincar\u00e9\nformulates a new view of geometric theories, that geometry does not\nexpress true or false propositions and that there are no special\nobjects which geometry studies. Rather, geometry is just a system of\nrelations that can be applied to many kinds of objects.\n\nPoincar\u00e9 argues against Russell\u2019s view of definition,\nclaiming that the meaning of primitive terms can be fixed by the\ngeometrical system in which we are working. Fixing the meaning of\nprimitive terms by the system is the only way to proceed,\nPoincar\u00e9 argues, because, if we were to take a primitive term\nout of the context of a system, it would lose all meaning:\n\n\nIf one wants to isolate a term and exclude its relations with other\nterms, nothing will remain. This term will not only become\nindefinable, it will become devoid of meaning.\n(Poincar\u00e9 1900: 78, Poincar\u00e9\u2019s emphasis)\n\n\nAs Poincar\u00e9 explains in a section entitled \u201cForm and\nMatter\u201d of his Monist article of 1898, the idea is that in\ngeometry the properties of the primitives or of the objects to which\ngeometrical relations are applied are not important at all, as far as\ngeometry is concerned. The set of relations that hold between the\nprimitives constitute the form, not the matter, of geometric objects,\nand these relations are what are studied. The form constitutes the\nrelational aspect of Poincar\u00e9\u2019s structuralism.\n\nBy recognizing Poincar\u00e9\u2019s heritage as a structural point\nof view, Schlick insists on the conventional aspect of his\nstructuralism. He sees in Poincar\u00e9\u2019s conventions a third\ntype of definition between the implicit definitions of the axiomatic\nmethod and the concrete or ostensive definitions of physical objects.\nThese conventions are, as Friedman observes \u201ccrucial for an\nunderstanding of how we achieve a coordination between concepts and\nempirical reality in the mathematical exact sciences\u201d (2007:\n100). As Schlick explains:\n\n\nTo define a concept implicitly is to determine it by means of its\nrelations to other concepts. But to apply such a concept to reality is\nto choose, out of the infinite wealth of relations in the world, a\ncertain group or complex and to embrace as a unit by designating it\nwith a name. By suitable choice it is always possible under certain\ncircumstances to obtain an unambiguous designation of the real by\nmeans of the concept. Conceptual definitions and coordinations that\ncome into being in this fashion we call conventions (using this term\nin the narrower sense, because in the broader sense, of course, all\ndefinitions are agreements). It was Henri Poincar\u00e9 who\nintroduced the term convention in this narrower sense into natural\nphilosophy; and one of the most important tasks of that discipline is\nto investigate the nature and meaning of the various conventions found\nin natural science (Schlick 1925, 91\u201392).\n\n\nAccording to Schlick, Poincar\u00e9\u2019s conventions combine\nconceptual definitions and coordinations. Given the fact that both\nexpressions are completely foreign to Poincar\u00e9\u2019s style,\nhow should one understand Schlick\u2019s claim? In fact,\nSchlick\u2019s expressions designate two different aspects of\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s structural approach, which pay attention to\nthe fact that Poincar\u00e9 is not an ante rem\nstructuralist (the ante rem structuralist takes the pattern\nto exist independently of any systems that exemplify it). At first\nglance he seems to be an ontological realist with respect to\nrelational universals (but not with respect to individuals\n(relata)), despite his predicativist attitude. As Elie Zahar\nemphasizes, such a position is not naturally compatible with classical\nsemantics (logic) because this latter \u201cseems unable to interpret\nrelations except through their relata\u201d: one cannot\nconfirm \\(R(a,b)\\) without determining\n\n\nthe referents of both, \u2018\\(a\\)\u2019 and\n\u2018\\(b\\)\u2019 in order then to ascertain whether\n\\(\\lt a,b\\gt\\) belongs to the referent of \u2018\\(R\\)\u2019.\n(Zahar 2001: 38)\n\n\nAn answer to this difficulty can be found by examining four steps of\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s psycho-physiological reconstruction of the\ngenesis of geometry. In his early articles, Poincar\u00e9 argues\nthat geometry concerns only the relations expressed in the axioms, not\nsome inherent features of the primitives:\n\n\nWhat we call geometry is nothing but the study of formal properties of\na certain continuous group; so we may say, space is a group.\n(Poincar\u00e9 1898: 41)\n\n\nThe first step of Poincar\u00e9\u2019s construction of geometrical\nspace via groups proceeds from the observable fact that a set of\nimpressions can be modified in two distinct ways: on the one hand\nwithout our feeling muscular sensations, and on the other, by a\nvoluntary motor action accompanied by muscular sensations. So, as in\nCarnap\u2019s Aufbau, the starting point here is the\ndefinition (guided by experience) of two two-place relations: an\nexternal change \\(a\\) (with \u2018\\(x a\ny\\)\u2019 for \u2018\\(x\\) changes in \\(y\\)\nwithout muscular sensation\u2019) and an internal\nchange \\(S\\) (with \u2018\\(x S y\\)\u2019\nfor \u2018\\(x\\) changes in \\(y\\)\naccompanied by muscular sensations\u2019). In the second step, he\nintroduces a classification of external changes, some of which can be\nbrought back to the starting point by an internal change (changes of\nposition), while others (changes of state) cannot. One presupposes \u201cby\nconvention\u201d or better by decision, that the internal compensation\nfor external changes is exact and not approximate. In the third step,\nPoincar\u00e9 defines the equivalence class of changes of position\nthrough an identity condition with respect to the compensation by\ninternal changes and calls it a displacement:\n\n Two internal changes have to be considered identical iff they\nhave induced the same muscular sensations. (Poincar\u00e9 1905b: 79;\n1913b: 258 ff.). \n\n\\( \\dfrac{\\alpha, \\beta \\text{ external}}{S \\text{ internal}} \\Bigg\\} \\text{ changes}\\)\n\n\\(\\alpha \\sim \\beta\\) iff \\(\\exists S (S\\alpha \\doteq S\\beta \\doteq I)\\)\n\nThis means that two external changes are equivalent iff they possess a\ncommon character (i.e., to be canceled by \\(S\\)).\n\\(S = S'\\) iff \\(\\exists \\alpha(\\alpha S \\doteq \\alpha S \\doteq I)\\) \nIf \u201c\\(\\sim\\)\u201d and \u201c\\(\\approx\\)\u201d are equivalent\nrelations, then each equivalence class of the changes of position is a\ndisplacement, so we can recognize that two displacements are\nidentical. \n\n\nThe fourth step and Poincar\u00e9\u2019s main result is that each\nset of displacement classes (external & internal) forms a group in\nthe mathematical sense. The general concept of a group is a form of\nour understanding that \u201cpre-exists in our mind\u201d (1902:107;\n2017: 56 and 68; 1898: 42\u201343) or is an ante rem\nstructure, which the specific displacement-structure \\((=\\)\ntransformation group) exemplifies. Thus, the genesis of geometry is\nbased on an epistemological process founded on previous\nclassifications, carried out as a relationship between a structure as\nnorm of invariance and conventionally adapted systems as\ninstantiations or exemplifications of these norms.\n\nWhere there is a choice between different possibilities, conventions\nonly become involved at a further step of the mathematical\nconstruction where the properties of the transformation group are\nstudied and choices are made concerning distance (a metric). It\nfollows that the Euclidean axiom of distance is not\nexclusively the result of a conventional (decisional) choice\nin the linguistic sense, rather, it is a \u201cdisguised\ndefinition\u201d or an \u201capparent hypothesis.\u201d\nPoincar\u00e9 uses the term \u201cdisguised definition\u201d\nbefore 1899, the year of Hilbert\u2019s famous Foundations of\nGeometry, to express the fact that language apparently used\ndescriptively is not descriptive in actuality. Certain axioms appear\ndescriptive, but instead define the objectivity of a fact\n(Poincar\u00e9 1899: 274). Such a fact is found to be defined only\nup to structure, although it clearly reflects the truth of certain\nrelations between sensations whose qualities remain unknowable, as\nshown by Helmholtz and others (Poincar\u00e9 1905b: 174.\n\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s often quoted structuralist Credo that\nin mathematics an entity \u201cexists\u201d means \u201cthat\nits defintion does not imply a contradiction\u201d (1902: 70; 2017:\n38\u201339; 1905c: 819), must be seen in a non-Hilbertian light.\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s geometric propositions (conventions), which\nare neither true nor false, are not propositional schemata that can be\nsatisfied by a model. For reasons concerning in particular the\ninvolvement of a vicious circle with respect to the principle of\ncomplete induction, Poincar\u00e9 rejects the idea of ensuring\nmathematical reliability with a Hilbert-style consistency proof\n(Poincar\u00e9 1906: 301; cf. Detlefsen 1986: 59 ff. for a critical\nassessment). Even with respect to geometry, he takes a structural\nposition without, however, disengaging meaning and knowledge\ncompletely from ostension. Nevertheless, Poincar\u00e9 begins his\nalternative reliability construction only apparently with\nsensations as ostensive contacts with the given, since he is not an\nempiricist. Instead, in a move similar to Helmholtz\u2019s conception\nof intuition as imagined sensible impressions, Poincar\u00e9\nintroduces a representation of a two-place sensation relation, based\non the imagination of single sensations. The representation\nof an object in sensible space means nothing other than the\ndeliberate and conscious representation of muscular sensations\nthought necessary to reach the object (Poincar\u00e9 1902:\n82; 2017: 48\u201349). The sensation relations are then the\nplace-holder of the categories (forms) of sensible space and of\ngroups. Poincar\u00e9\u2019s conventions in geometry are first of\nall the tool that he uses to close (by decision) the gap between the\nexactness of a structure and the objectivity of\nsensation-relations based on an imagined ostensive contact\n(reflecting on sensations). If this interpretation is right,\nthen Poincar\u00e9\u2019s concept of structure is not the new\nHilbertian one that derives from the axiomatization of Euclidean\ngeometry, but rather constitutes a development of the traditional\nalgebraic concept of structure and concerns continuous groups on the\none hand and the type of iteration and complete induction on the other\nhand. His epistemological stance has a strong affinity with\nSchlick\u2019s General Theory of Knowledge. Given, on the\none hand, that \u201cpure quality is impenetrable\u201d and, on the\nother hand, that knowledge is public\u2014\u201cno discourse, no\nobjectivity\u201d (Poincar\u00e9 1905b: 179; 1913b:\n347\u201348)\u2014how is it possible that although we cannot be sure\nthat our experience is the same, we can intersubjectively\nknow the same thing? The answer is found in the thesis that\n\u201cscience is a system of relations\u201d (Poincar\u00e9 1905b:\n181; 1913b: 349).\n\nContrary to in re structuralists, Poincar\u00e9\u2019s\nstructures are not ontologically but rather epistemically dependent on\ntheir instances. The faculty capable of creating the general concept\nof a group or of indefinite iteration is the expression of a form of\nour understanding \u201cprior to all experience\u201d\n(Poincar\u00e9 1898: 41). He defends a kind of constructive\nepistemological Platonism or anti-nominalism (Linnebo 2011), in which\nintuition is a cognitive faculty used to grasp from series of\nimagined sensations or concrete iterations the general structure. This\nis the solution that explains Folina\u2019s characterization of\nPoincar\u00e9, which at first sight seems inconsistent, as an\nante-rem structuralist and as an anti-realist with respect to\nmathematical objects (Folina 2020). The structure is not itself a\nposition in a meta-structure, but the psycho-physiological procedure\nis the way in which we know of its existence in our mind.\nPoincar\u00e9 uses it as a metamathematical \u201cinstrument which\nserves not to represents things to ourselves, but to reason\u201d\nupon the psycho-physiological genesis of real actions with\nimagined sensations (Poincar\u00e9 1898: 41). The genesis\nof geometry is based on an epistemological process founded on previous\nclassifications, carried out as a relationship between a structure as\nnorm of invariance and \u201cconventionally\u201d adapted systems as\ninstantiations and exemplifications of these norms.\n\nThe exemplification of the structure by a large variety of systems\n(imagined sensations, mathematical and physical facts, objects) having\nsome characters in common is an aesthetic operation, not a logical\none. The general group structure is given by intuition rather than by\nan explicit identity criterion and the determination of its formal\nproperties expressed by the means of sub-groups is the result of a\nmastery occasioned by concrete systems (samples). The mathematician\ncreates structural harmony as does an artist. In art, the structure\ncan be implicit, while in mathematics it is normally explicit, even if\nit is qualitative. The number of their exemplifications, i.e., of\ntheir applications, is the aesthetic element \u201cuniting\u201d\nboth, mathematical and artistic structures (Poincar\u00e9\n1905b: 104; 1913b: 280). There is for example nearly no mathematical\ntheory where the notion of group does not intervene by giving the same\nname to different \u201cthings\u201d (Poincar\u00e9 1921: 137).\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s geometric or algebraic conventions form a\nconceptual construction that is irreducible to a combination of\nclearly distinguished parts of structural elements and\naesthetic exemplifications. In this sense the result of the\npsycho-physiological genesis of geometry is as a whole a system\nunderstood as a pragmatic procedure.\n\nThe insight that geometry is the result of a genesis where the\ndescription and the construction of objects are two aspects of the\nsame procedure leads to an alternative interpretation of Quine\u2019s\nthesis of the incompleteness of mathematical objects and the ideas to\nwhich they belong. The freedom that we have to choose a geometric\ndistance function is due neither to a general skepticism nor to a\npurely verbal accommodation with respect to a set theoretic\ndevelopment of the foundations of mathematics that itself possesses\nontological commitment, but rather to an ontological peculiarity of a\nnew sort (Quine 1986: 401). Structures (groups) are not patterns whose\npositions are given entities. The genesis of the geometrical metric\nstructure is as the advent of relations linked to the concrete in an\naesthetic analysis of the general idea, rather than either\nthe creation of the concrete material from the general idea (a group)\nor as the creation of the category (a group) from the concrete. What\nPoincar\u00e9 calls \u201cobjective reality common to many thinking\nbeings\u201d is exactly the \u201charmony expressed by mathematical\nlaws\u201d (Poincar\u00e9 1905b: 23; 1913b: 209). To move along\nthis predefined track of a reconciliation of aesthetic sensitivity and\ncognition leads directly to Nelson Goodman (1969).\n\nAs Philippe Nabonnand has remarked, Poincar\u00e9\u2019s early\npresentation of geometrical space is as a whole in fact circular:\n\n\nin his 1898 paper, [Poincar\u00e9] put forward a (mathematical)\nexplanation of the three dimensions of space. He observed that the\nEuclidean group, selected after many conventions, can be seen as\nacting on a space of three, four or five dimensions. The choice of a\nthree-dimensional space is justified by considerations of commodity.\nUnfortunately, Poincar\u00e9\u2019s argument is viciously circular\nbecause the choice of the Euclidean group was grounded on Lie\u2019s\nclassification of transformation-groups operating on \\(\\mathrm{R}^3\\)\n(Heinzmann and Nabonnand 2008: 171).\n\n\nNevertheless, Poincar\u00e9 noted his mistake and introduced in\n1905b \u201crepresentative space\u201d \u2014 a physical continuum\nto which experience proves that it is more convenient to attribute\nthree dimensions \u2014 and which may also imply the matching\nthree-dimensionality of  \u201cgeometric space,\u201d which is\na mathematical continuum, for convenience (Poincar\u00e9 1905b: 94;\n1913b: 272 \u2014 in order to justify his utilization of Lie\u2019s\nclassification. The consequence is that geometry is not independent of\nany further mathematical space, the structure of which must be\npresupposed as a primitive notion, contrary to the pragmatically\nsuggested group notion existing in our mind.\n",
