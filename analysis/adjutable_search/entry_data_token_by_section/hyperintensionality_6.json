Granularity and the Structure of Hyperintensionality\n\nThe flip side of hyperintensionality\u2019s pervasiveness is its\nencompassing very diverse phenomena. We now investigate what (little)\nwe know about the general structure of hyperintensionality. The\ninitial characterization, recall, merely tells us that a concept or\noperator is hyperintensional when it is more fine-grained than\nintensional or standard modal concepts or operators, marking a\ndistinction invisible to the latter. As Jespersen and Du\u017e\u00ed\nreminded us, little is said on \u201chow hyper\u201d hyperintensions\nare. The tag of \u201cgranularity problems\u201d (Barwise 1997; Jago\n2014; Bjerring & Schwarz 2017) labels a set of issues concerning\nthe right level of fine-grainedness. There are several related\nproblems here, because different hyperintensional concepts seem to\ndisplay different degrees of fine-grainedness. This can be understood\nagain in terms of substitution salva veritate for the\nrelevant operators: \\(X\\) is strictly more fine-grained than \\(Y\\)\nwhen all substitutions that go through for \\(X\\) also do for \\(Y,\\)\nbut \\(X\\) fails some, which goes through for \\(Y.\\)\n\nA requirement often suggested is that a hyperintensional account of\nthis or that notion shouldn\u2019t make it as fine-grained as the\nsyntax of the language one is working with\u2014on pain of giving\naway the very point of having a semantics for it. Propositions may be\nmore fine-grained than sets of possible worlds, but they had better\nnot be mappable 1:1 to the sentences expressing them. Otherwise, we\nwould lose one main motivation for having propositions to begin with,\nnamely that syntactically different sentences can say the same thing.\nIt also seems intuitive that, e.g., the content of \\(A\\) should be the\nsame as that of \\(A \\land A\\), and that \\(A \\land B\\) should have the\nsame content as \\(B \\land A\\): \u201cIt\u2019s windy and rainy\ntoday\u201d seems to just say the same thing as \u201cIt\u2019s\nrainy and windy today\u201d (for further motivations for\ncoarse-graining, see Bjerring & Schwarz 2017). On the other hand,\na limited cognitive agent may fail to make even the simplest inference\nstarting from what she knows or believes: she may believe that \\(A\n\\land B\\), fail to perform Conjunction Elimination, and thus fail to\nbelieve that \\(A\\). Psychologically very realistic accounts of\nknowledge or belief seem to require extreme fine-grainedness, cutting\nmore finely than same-saying. Jespersen (2010) is one example of a\ntheory that has very fine-grained meanings available for some\nconstructions, while offering more coarse-grained meanings for some\ntraditional purposes where little or no hyperintensionality is\nrequired.\n\nOne may hope for a total ordering of hyperintensional notions\nby fine-grainedness, i.e., an ordering such that any two given ones\nare comparable: given any \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), either \\(X\\) is at least as\nfine-grained as \\(Y\\), or vice versa. But one can show that the simple\nsetting is wrong. One can provide intuitive examples (inspired by\nHornischer 2017, which also includes a thorough discussion) of\nincomparable hyperintensional operators: \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) for which\nthere are sentences \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), \\(D\\), such that \\(XA\\) and\n\\(XB\\) are equivalent but \\(YA\\) and \\(YB\\) are not, \\(YC\\) and \\(YD\\)\nare equivalent but \\(XC\\) and \\(XD\\) are not.\n\nTake \u201cLois Lane knows that \u2026\u201d and \u201c\u2026\nbecause Clark Kent loves the Guggenheim Museum\u201d. Consider the\nfour sentences:\n\n\\(A =\\) Clark Kent loves the Guggenheim Museum\n\\(B =\\) \u201cClark Kent loves the Guggenheim Museum\u201d is\ntrue\n\\(C =\\) Clark Kent is in New York\n\\(D =\\) Superman is in New York\n\n\nLois Lane knows that \\(A\\) (Clark Kent loves the Guggenheim Museum) if\nand only if she knows that \\(B\\) (\u201cClark Kent loves the\nGuggenheim Museum\u201d is true) (surely Lois knows how truth\nworks!). On the other hand, she knows that \\(C\\) (Clark Kent is in New\nYork), but she doesn\u2019t know that \\(D\\) (Superman, too, is), for\nshe is not aware that Superman is Clark Kent.\n\nAlso, it is false that \\(A\\) (Clark Kent loves the Guggenheim Museum)\nbecause Clark Kent loves the Guggenheim Museum (facts can\u2019t\nexplain themselves), while it is true that \\(B\\) (\u201cClark Kent\nloves the Guggenheim Museum\u201d is true) because Clark Kent loves\nthe Guggenheim Museum (assuming truth supervenes on/is grounded in\nfacts). On the other hand, \\(C\\) (Clark Kent is in New York) because\nClark Kent loves the Guggenheim Museum if and only if \\(D\\) (Superman\nis in New York) because Clark Kent loves the Guggenheim Museum, for\nSuperman is Clark Kent.\n\nSo knows and because turn out to be incomparable,\nand, given that they are hyperintensional, there is no total ordering\nfor hyperintensional notions. This may sustain some skepticism\n(ventilated, e.g., in Leitgeb 2019) on the possibility of a single\ntheory for all hyperintensional operators. On the other hand, it makes\nsense to conjecture that these can be at least partially ordered. It\nis then an issue worth investigating, whether concepts belonging to a\nsingle sub-family, e.g., the non-representational ones, or the\nrepresentational semantic ones, can be internally totally ordered\n(notice that knows is representational, while one may take\nbecause as belonging to \u201contic\u201d explanation). Or,\nthe other way around, the identification of totally ordered subsets of\nthe partially ordered set of hyperintensional concepts may be a good\nway to group such concepts into families that carve at the joints.\n",
