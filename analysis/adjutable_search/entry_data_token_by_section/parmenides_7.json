    "main_text": "Some Principal Types of Interpretation || The Logical-Dialectical Interpretation\n3.2 The Logical-Dialectical Interpretation\n\nOne problem with Guthrie\u2019s view of Parmenides is that the\nsupposition that Parmenides\u2019 strict monism was developed as a\ncritical reductio of Milesian material monism sits\nuncomfortably with the notion that he actually embraced this wildly\ncounter-intuitive metaphysical position. There is the same type of\ntension in the outmoded proposals that Parmenides was targeting\ncertain supposedly Pythagorean doctrines (a view developed in Raven\n1948 and ensconced in Kirk and Raven 1957). Even as Guthrie was\nwriting the first two volumes of his History, a shift was\nunderway toward understanding Parmenides\u2019 arguments as driven by\nstrictly logical considerations rather than by any critical agenda\nwith respect to the theories of his Ionian or Pythagorean\npredecessors. Here the watershed event was the publication of G. E. L.\nOwen\u2019s \u201cEleatic Questions\u201d (Owen 1960). Owen found\ninspiration in Bertrand Russell for his positive interpretation of\nParmenides\u2019 argument in fragment 2, the essential point of which\nOwen took to be that what can be talked or thought about exists.\n\nRussell\u2019s treatment of Parmenides in his A History of\nWestern Philosophy was conditioned by his own abiding concern\nwith the problems of analysis posed by negative existential\nstatements. The essence of Parmenides\u2019 argument, according to\nRussell, is as follows:\n\nWhen you think, you think of something; when you use a name,\nit must be the name of something. Therefore both thought and\nlanguage require objects outside themselves. And since you can think\nof a thing or speak of it at one time as well as another, whatever can\nbe thought of or spoken of must exist at all times. Consequently there\ncan be no change, since change consists in things coming into being or\nceasing to be (Russell 1945, 49).\n\n\nHere the unargued identification of the subject of Parmenides\u2019\ndiscourse as \u201cwhatever can be thought of or spoken of\u201d\nprefigures Owen\u2019s identification of it as \u201cwhatever can be\nthought and talked about,\u201d with both proposals deriving from fr.\n2.7\u20138. There follows in Russell\u2019s History an\nexposition of the problems involved in speaking meaningfully about\n(currently) non-existent subjects, such as George Washington or\nHamlet, after which Russell restates the first stage of\nParmenides\u2019 argument as follows: \u201cif a word can be used\nsignificantly it must mean something, not nothing, and\ntherefore what the word means must in some sense exist\u201d (Russell\n1945, 50). So influential has Russell\u2019s understanding been,\nthanks in no small part to Owen\u2019s careful development of it,\nthat it is not uncommon for the problem of negative existential\nstatements to be referred to as \u201cParmenides\u2019\nparadox.\u201d\n\nThe arguments of fragment 8, on this view, are then understood as\nshowing that what can be thought and talked about is, surprisingly,\nwithout variation in time and space, that is, absolutely one and\nunchanging. Owen adapted an image from Wittgenstein in characterizing\nthese arguments, ones which \u201ccan only show the vacuousness of\ntemporal and spatial distinctions by a proof which employs\nthem,\u201d as \u201ca ladder which must be thrown away when one has\nclimbed it\u201d (Owen 1960, 67). Owen also vigorously opposed the\nassumption that \u201cParmenides wrote his poem in the broad\ntradition of Ionian and Italian cosmology,\u201d arguing that\nParmenides claims no measure of truth or reliability for the cosmogony\nin the latter part of his poem and that his own arguments in the\n\u201cTruth\u201d (i.e., the \u201cWay of Conviction\u201d)\nneither derive from this earlier tradition nor depict the cosmos as\nspherical in shape (Owen 1960, 48). On Owen\u2019s reading, not so\nvery differently from Guthrie\u2019s, Parmenides\u2019 cosmology is\n\u201cno more than a dialectical device,\u201d that is, \u201cthe\ncorrect or the most plausible analysis of those presuppositions on\nwhich ordinary men, and not just theorists, seem to build their\npicture of the physical world,\u201d these being \u201cthe existence\nof at least two irreducibly different things in a constant process of\ninteraction,\u201d whereas Parmenides\u2019 own arguments have by\nthis point shown both the plurality and change this picture\npresupposes to be unacceptable (Owen 1960, 50 and 54\u20135).\n\nOwen\u2019s view of Parmenidean metaphysics as driven by primarily\nlogical concerns and of his cosmology as no more than a dialectical\ndevice would have a deep influence on two of the most important\nsurveys of Presocratic thought since Guthrie\u2014Jonathan\nBarnes\u2019s The Presocratic Philosophers\n(19791, 19822) and Kirk, Raven, and\nSchofield\u2019s The Presocratic Philosophers\n(19832). While abandoning the idea that Parmenidean monism\nwas a specific reaction to the theories of any of his predecessors,\nthese two works continue to depict his impact on later Presocratic\nsystems as decisive. On their Owenian line, the story becomes that the\narguments of Parmenides and his Eleatic successors were meant to be\ngenerally destructive of all previous cosmological theorizing, in so\nfar as they purported to show that the existence of change, time, and\nplurality cannot be naively presumed. Parmenides\u2019 arguments in\nfragment 8 effectively become, for advocates of this line, a\ngeneralized rather than a specific reductio of early Greek\ncosmological theorizing. Barnes, furthermore, responded to an\nobjection that had been raised against Owen\u2019s identification of\nParmenides\u2019 subject as whatever can be talked and thought\nabout\u2014namely, that this identification derives from the reason\ngiven at fr. 2.7\u20138 for rejecting the second path of inquiry,\nwhereas an audience could not be expected to understand this to be the\ngoddess\u2019 subject when she introduces the first two ways of\ninquiry in fr. 2.3 and 2.5. Barnes modified Owen\u2019s\nidentification of Parmenides\u2019 subject so that it might be found\nin the immediate context, specifically in the implicit object of fr.\n2.2\u2019s description of the paths as \u201cways of inquiry\u201d;\nthus, according to Barnes, the first path \u201csays that\nwhatever we inquire into exists, and cannot not exist\u201d\n(Barnes 1982, 163). Barnes\u2019s modified Owenian line has since\nbeen endorsed by prominent interpreters (including Schofield in Kirk,\nRaven, and Schofield 1983, 245; cf. Brown 1994, 217). Barnes also\nadvanced the more heterodox proposal that Parmenides was not\nnecessarily a monist at all, arguing that the fragments are compatible\nwith the existence of a plurality of \u201cParmenidean Beings\u201d\n(Barnes 1979, cf. Untersteiner 1955). While this proposal has had\nfewer adherents among other interpreters favoring the Russell-Owen\nline, it has been taken up by certain advocates of the next type of\ninterpretation.\n",
