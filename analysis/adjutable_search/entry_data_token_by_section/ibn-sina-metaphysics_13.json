    "main_text": "Modality and Existence || The Kinds of Status of Existence\n4.4 The Kinds of Status of Existence\n\nThe significance of these determinations becomes clear if one\nconsiders the other kinds of status (a\u1e25k\u0101m:\nliterally \u201cjudgments, statutes, precepts\u201d) Avicenna\nassigns to existence in addition to necessity and possibility (which\nin Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t I, 1, 7, 16\u201319 are said to be\namong the proper accidents of being), namely priority and\nposteriority, on the one hand, and richness and\npoverty (or indigence), on the other\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, VI, 3, 276, 13\u2013277,\n 3).[10]\n These determinations explain the distinction between essence and\nexistence (or \u201cproper\u201d and \u201caffirmative\u201d\nexistence) and are, in turn, clarified by the notions of\n\u201cnexus\u201d and \u201cneed\u201d. Indeed, what is necessary\nin itself is ontologically and axiologically prior to the\npossible because it is independent, whereas the possible is\nposterior precisely because it depends on a cause. Insofar as\nit is autonomous, the necessary is also rich, while the\npossible, which is posterior and secondary, is needy, poor or\nindigent. The necessary is \u201crich\u201d because it is\nindependent of any thing; the possible is \u201cpoor\u201d because\nit cannot exist without something else (i.e., without the cause). From\na theoretical point of view, these determinations immediately refer to\na causal relation that is either negated (by what is prior, rich and\nnecessary) or affirmed (by what is posterior, poor and possible). In\nother words, the determinations Avicenna calls the kinds of status of\nexistence serve to establish a clear distinction between a kind of\nexistence (i.e., one existent) that is necessarily uncaused and a kind\nof existence (i.e., of existent things) that is necessarily\n caused.[11]\n It is in fact in the light of the relationship between the absolute\nPrinciple and the world that they reveal their true significance. They\nhave an absolute or a relative meaning according to the causal\nrelation to which they refer. If the causal relation is relative and\nconsequently concerns secondary causes, these determinations are\nrelative, so that the cause is said to be necessary, prior and rich\nonly with respect to its effect, not in itself. If the relation is\nabsolute (if it refers to the First Cause), they are absolute: in this\ncase, the cause is necessary, prior and rich in itself.\n",
