    "main_text": "The Morality of Procreation || \u201cSurrogacy\u201d and Contractually Assisted Reproduction\n3.3 \u201cSurrogacy\u201d and Contractually Assisted Reproduction\n\nPerhaps the most controversial form of assisted reproduction is\nso-called \u201csurrogate\u201d motherhood or contract pregnancy.\nSuch arrangements can take many forms, but the most widely discussed\ninvolves two parties, a contracting couple and a\n\u201csurrogate\u201d or gestational mother. The gestational mother\ncarries a child derived from the gametes of one or both members of the\ncontracting couple and agrees to give the child over to the couple\nafter birth. Surrogacy is now regulated in most countries. Commercial\nsurrogacy is widely, although not universally, illegal, driving an\nincrease in international surrogacy. Many more jurisdictions permit\nso-called \u201caltruistic\u201d surrogacy, which does not involve\npaying the surrogate mother over and above compensating her for direct\ncosts.\n\nMany of the disputes surrounding contract pregnancy focus on the\nquestion of who should be given parental rights and responsibilities\nif the arrangement breaks down. (In some cases, neither party to the\narrangement wants to keep the baby; in other cases both parties want\nto keep it.) Indeed, much of the impetus for recent accounts of the\ngrounds of parenthood has derived from attempts to adjudicate such\ndisputes (Shanley 2018, and see\n section 4).\n\nRepro-libertarians insist that a right to procreative autonomy entails\nprotecting most methods of \u201ccollaborative reproduction,\u201d\nso long as they are safe and consensual (Robertson 1994, chap. 6). For\nthem, the right to procreate is a special case of the right to make\nbinding contracts (see Straehle, 2019). But it is not settled whether\nsuch contracts ought to be legal and, if so, enforceable.\n\nOne central point of contention is whether gestational surrogacy\ninvolves commodification\u2014for example, by entailing that the\ngestational mother is selling her baby\u2014or whether it is no\ndifferent in kind from other forms of paid childcare (Anderson 1990;\nRadin 1996; Glover et al. 1989; Shanley 1993; but see also Arneson\n1992). It is also disputed whether a parental right acquired through\ngestation can be contractually transferred: on a gestationalist view\nwhich grounds the right to parent in the intimate relationship between\ngestator and fetus, the justification of the right entails that it is\nnot subject to transfer (Gheaus 2016b, and see 4.2).\n\nA distinct concern has to do with whether anyone who undertakes a\ncontractual obligation to surrender custody of future children can do\nso autonomously. Some writers argue that such decisions cannot be\nautonomous, and hence that surrogacy contracts should not only be\nunenforceable but also illegal (Dodds and Jones 1989b; see Purdy 1989\nand Oakley 1992 for a response).\n\nContract pregnancy is also criticized on grounds of harm to women. One\nsuch harm is that, in practice, it treats women as, and reinforces the\nperception of them as, mere fetal \u201ccontainers\u201d (Purdy\n1990, Satz 2010, Baron 2019). The fact that it gives medical staff and\nintending parents extensive control over women\u2019s sexuality and\ntheir bodies is particularly troubling in the context of gender\ninequality (Satz 2010). But others reject bans on surrogacy contracts\nas paternalistic, unduly limiting women\u2019s freedom. Nevertheless,\neven those who defend contract pregnancy urge that safeguards, such as\nmandated post-natal waiting periods during which the gestational\nmother is permitted to change her mind or age-based restrictions on\nwho may enter into such contracts, should be in place to protect the\ninterests of the child and of the gestator (Steinbock 1988; Straehle\n2016; see also Botterell and McLeod 2016).\n\nMore recently, the discussion has moved to ethical analyses of\ninternational surrogacy arrangements. These have typically involved\ncommissioning parents from high-income countries and surrogate mothers\nfrom poorer populations in less wealthy countries, including India and\nThailand. The vast power differentials between the parties, expanded\nroles for surrogacy agencies brokering the arrangements, and loose\nregulatory regimes have made for heightened concern about exploitation\nand other potential wrongs (Panitch 2013, and see discussion in Purdy\n1989, Wilkinson 2016).\n",
