It is mentioned in order to\nset the stage for the much later situationist movement in philosophy.\nThe main philosophers responsible for jumpstarting this discussion\nwere Gilbert Harman in a series of papers dating back to 1999, and\nJohn Doris in several papers and most importantly in his 2002 book,\nLack of Character: Personality and Moral Behavior (Harman\n1999, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2009; Doris 1998, 2002, 2010; and Merritt et\nal. 2010. For others supporting their views, see Blackburn 1998:\n36\u201337; Campbell 1999; Hurka 2001: 44; Goldie 2004: chapter 3;\nVranas 2005; Appiah 2008: chapter 2; Upton 2009; Badhwar 2009;\nSarkissian 2010; and Alfano 2013). Broadly speaking, Harman and Doris\nused studies and claims that were influential during the situationist\nmovement in psychology, and applied them to debates in contemporary\nethical theory. In particular, their focus was on how the empirical\ndata, as they interpreted it, could cause trouble for Aristotelian\nvirtue ethics.\n\nTheir broad argumentative strategy proceeded in two stages:\n\n\n\nStage One. Draw on studies in psychology to show that people\ntypically do not have what they call global character traits.\n\n\n\nStage Two. Show that this is a serious problem for\nAristotelian virtue ethics, as well as any other view in normative\nethics which is committed in some central way to global character\ntraits. \n\n\nFirst we need to clarify what global character traits are before\ndiving into the details of the two stages. According to Doris, global\ncharacter traits have two main features:\n\n\n\nConsistency. Character traits are reliably manifested in\ntrait-relevant behavior across a diversity of trait-relevant eliciting\nconditions that may vary widely in their conduciveness to the\nmanifestation of the trait in question. \n\n\nStability. Character traits are reliably manifested in\ntrait-relevant behavior over iterated trials of similar trait-relevant\neliciting conditions (Doris 2002: 22. A third feature he mentions,\nevaluative integration, does not factor much into his\ndiscussion.). \n\n\nAn example would help. Consider temperance. A person with this trait\nis expected to exhibit it over time in the same kind of situation, say\nwhen eating at restaurants. But she is also expected to exhibit it\nacross situations which are relevant to the trait, such as drinking,\nsexual activity, and so forth, as well as eating at home, eating at\nairports, eating with friends, eating alone, and the like. The same is\ntrue for other examples of what we might call\n\u201ctraditional\u201d virtues, such as courage, honesty, and\nkindness. Vices like cruelty and dishonesty count as global character\ntraits as well.\n\nWith this background in place, let us turn to the two stages.\n1.1.1 Stage One: Against Widespread Possession of Global Character Traits\n\nOn the basis of certain studies in psychology, Harman and Doris\nreasoned roughly as follows (this reconstruction is from Miller 2014:\n192):\n\nIf there is widespread possession of the traditional virtues and\nvices understood as global character traits, then systematic empirical\nobservation using appropriate psychology experiments will reveal most\npeople behaving in a certain kind of way.\nHowever, systematic empirical observation using appropriate\npsychology experiments fails to reveal that most people act in this\nkind of way.\nTherefore, there is not widespread possession of the traditional\nvirtues and vices understood as global character traits (for more, see\nDoris 1998: 505\u2013507; Merritt et al. 2010: 357\u2013358).\n\n\nThe \u201cbehaving in a certain kind of way\u201d is behaving\nvirtuously. This could pertain to behaving virtuously over time in the\nsame situations (stability) or behaving virtuously across situations\n(cross-situational consistency).\n\nHarman and Doris did not take the experimental evidence to challenge\nthe stability of character traits. As we will see below, they were\nhappy to accept the widespread possession of what they called\n\u201clocal\u201d character traits which are restricted to narrow\nsituations like eating at home. Instead, their focus was on the\ncross-situational consistency of global traits. There they thought\nthere is good empirical reason to believe most people do not have\nvirtues and vices which exhibit consistent behavior across\ntrait-relevant situations.\n\nOne way they could have argued for this was by examining the\npsychological literature with respect to a variety of different kinds\nof moral behavior, such as stealing, helping, eating, hurting, and so\nforth, and seeing whether the data was compatible with the\ncorresponding virtue (or vice). Instead, though, Harman and Doris\nchose the strategy of focusing in great detail on just one\nvirtue\u2014compassion\u2014and using the literature in psychology\non pro-social behavior.\n\nThe choice of compassion made a great deal of sense given the state of\nthe empirical literature. There are numerous studies that have been\ndone over the past sixty years on helping behavior, in contrast to\nother kinds of morally relevant behavior which might pertain to other\nvirtues. Nevertheless, Harman and Doris did not take the conclusion of\ntheir argument to apply just to one virtue, and so expected that\nfuture studies in other areas of morality, when combined with whatever\nstudies we currently have, would tell a similar story about absent\nvirtue.\n\nFocusing on helping and compassion, here are three of the studies\nwhich occupied a central place in their discussion:\n\n\n\nDime in the Phone Booth. The psychologists Isen and Levin had\nan experimental group find a dime in the coin return slot of a phone\nbooth, whereas the control group did not. Individuals in both groups\nsubsequently had a chance to help pick up dropped papers. 88% in the\nexperimental group helped; only 4% in the control group did (Isen and\nLevin 1972). There were replication problems with this study, but\nthere are many other studies on the effect of mood on helping which\nfound a similar pattern (see Miller 2013: chapter 3). \n\n\nLady in Distress. In the 1969 \u201cLady in Distress\u201d\nexperiment, participants heard a loud crash in the next room together\nwith a woman\u2019s scream. It sounded like a bookshelf had topped\ndown on her, and cries of pain quickly followed. The question was\nwhether participants would do anything to help. Those who were by\nthemselves helped 70% of the time. But shockingly, if a participant\nwas in the same room with a stranger who didn\u2019t do anything to\nrespond, helping happened only 7% of the time (Latan\u00e9 and Rodin\n1969: 193\u2013195; Latan\u00e9 and Darley 1970: 60\u201363).\n\n\n\nObedience to Authority. Stanley Milgram\u2019s shock\nexperiments are arguably the most famous in the history of psychology.\nEspecially relevant is experiment five, where a participant had to\ngive a test to an innocent person in another room, and turn up a dial\nwith increasingly greater shocks for each wrong answer. At 270 volts,\nthe test taker demanded to be released from the test and was making\nagonizing screams. At higher levels the pleas became desperate and\nhysterical. Nevertheless, under pressure from an authority figure, 80%\nof participants went at least to 270 volts, and 65% went all the way\nto the 450 volt XXX level, which was a lethal level of shock (so they\nthought) (Milgram 1974: 60). \n\n\nOther studies include the Princeton Theological Seminary hurry study\n(Darley and Batson 1973) and the Zimbardo prison experiment (Haney et\nal. 1973).\n\nHow are these studies supposed to tell against the widespread\npossession of the virtue of compassion? It isn\u2019t just that they\nshow people behaving less than virtuously in all three experimental\nsituations. After all, when participants found a dime, or when\nparticipants were alone in the next room, they did tend to\nhelp. In another version of the Milgram setup, when participants at\nthe 150 volt level heard commands from two authority figures which\ncontradicted either other, they immediately stopped at that level or\none more level above it (Milgram 1974: 95, 105\u2013107).\n\nRather, the alleged conflict with the virtue of compassion stems from\nthe apparent failure on behalf of most participants to be\nappropriately sensitive to the morally relevant considerations. A\ncompassionate person would not exhibit helping which is sensitive in\nthis way to finding a dime, or which is sensitive (in an emergency) to\nthe presence of an unresponsive bystander. Nor would they be so\ninsensitive to the screams and eventual death of a test\ntaker. As Harman and Doris wrote,\n\n\nboth disappointing omissions and appalling actions are\nreadily induced through seemingly minor situations. What\nmakes these findings so striking is just how insubstantial\nthe situational influences that produce troubling moral failures seem\nto be (Merritt et al. 2010: 357, emphasis theirs; see also Doris 1998:\n507, 2002: 2, 28, 35\u201336; Harman 2003: 90).\n\n\nIt is important to be clear on exactly what Harman and Doris took\nthemselves to be arguing (here drawing on Miller 2014: 193\u2013194).\nThey should not be read as advancing the following:\n\nOn metaphysical grounds the property of being compassionate\ndoes not exist.\n\nThis is a matter of debate for metaphysics, and is not something that\nthese psychology experiments could establish. Furthermore, they should\nnot be read as arguing for the strong empirical claim that:\n\nNo human being has ever had any of the traditional virtues or vices\nsuch as compassion, either as a matter of psychological necessity or\nas a matter of contingent fact.\n\nDoris admitted that, as far as the studies themselves showed, there\ncould be a few virtuous and a few vicious people (Doris 2002: 60, 65,\n112, 122; see also Vranas 2005: 16).\n\nAt the same time, it would be a mistake to think that they were only\narguing for an absence of evidence claim like:\n\nGiven the psychological evidence, we are not justified in believing on\nthe basis of that evidence that most people possess the traditional\nvirtues or vices such as compassion.\n\nThey did indeed accept this, but they also made stronger claims as\nwell. Harman said that, \u201cit may even be the case that there is\nno such thing as character\u201d (Harman 1999: 328; for recent\nqualifications, see Harman 2009: 238, 241). Doris argued that,\n\u201cpeople typically lack character\u201d (Doris 1998: 506, 2002:\n2). In a co-authored article with Maria Merritt they together said\nthat, \u201cBehavior is not typically ordered by robust\ntraits\u201d (Merritt et al. 2010: 358, emphasis theirs).\n\nHere, then, is how to understand their conclusion:\n\nGiven the psychological evidence, we are justified in believing on the\nbasis of that evidence that most people do not possess the\ntraditional virtues or vices such as compassion.\n\nWith this in mind, let us turn to the second stage of their\nargument.\n1.1.2 Stage Two: The Problem for Aristotelian Virtue Ethics\n\nHarman and Doris took the conclusion that most people do not possess\ntraditional virtues or vices and tried to show that it had problematic\nconsequences for certain positions in ethical theory. Specifically,\ntheir main target was a broadly Aristotelian form of virtue ethics, as\nwell as any other theories which made use of empirical claims about\nglobal character traits.\n\nHere is Harman first, writing about Aristotelian views:\n\n\nthis sort of virtue ethics presupposes that there are character traits\nof the relevant sort, that people differ in what character traits they\nhave, and these traits help to explain differences in the way people\nbehave (Harman 1999: 319).\n\n\nNext here is Doris in his 1998 paper:\n\n\nAristotelian virtue ethics, when construed as invoking a generally\napplicable descriptive psychology\u2026[is] subject to damaging\nempirical criticism (Doris 1998: 520).\n\n\nTheir shared assumption seems to be that Aristotelians make not only\nnormative but also empirical claims, in particular that the moral\nvirtues and/or vices are widely held by most people (see also Merritt\n2000: 366; Sreenivasan 2002: 48, 57, 63; Sabini and Silver 2005: 538).\nGiven that in the first stage they argued this is empirically\ndisconfirmed, it follows that Aristotelian virtue ethics is highly\nproblematic.\n\nIn his 2002 book, Doris\u2019s focus seemed to shift. Instead of\ntrying to show that the lack of virtue and vice provided evidence for\nthe falsity of Aristotelian virtue ethics, he instead appeared to take\nthe main upshot to be one about practicality, namely that virtue\nethics would no longer be practically relevant for most people who did\nnot have these traits (2002: chapter 6).\n\nHere in this second stage it is hard to pin down exactly how the\nargument was supposed to go. But Harman and Doris did succeed in\ngenerating a lot of interest in these issues, mostly among\nphilosophers who ended up being critical of their work.\n\nThe remainder of this section briefly distinguishes seven leading\nresponses to Harman and Doris\u2019s situationist argument, and then\nconcludes with some comments about what our characters might look like\nif indeed we do not have the traditional virtues.\n",
