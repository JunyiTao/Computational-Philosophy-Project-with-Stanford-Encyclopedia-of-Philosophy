Introduction: The Continuous, the Discrete, and the Infinitesimal\n\nWe are all familiar with the idea of continuity. To be\n continuous[1]\n is to constitute an unbroken or uninterrupted whole, like the ocean\nor the sky. A continuous entity\u2014a continuum\u2014has\nno \u201cgaps\u201d. Opposed to continuity is discreteness:\nto be\n discrete[2]\n is to be separated, like the scattered pebbles on a beach or the\nleaves on a tree. Continuity connotes unity; discreteness,\nplurality.\n\nWhile it is the fundamental nature of a continuum to be\nundivided, it is nevertheless generally (although not\ninvariably) held that any continuum admits of repeated or successive\ndivision without limit. This means that the process of\ndividing it into ever smaller parts will never terminate in an\nindivisible or an atom\u2014that is, a part which,\nlacking proper parts itself, cannot be further divided. In a word,\ncontinua are divisible without limit or infinitely\ndivisible. The unity of a continuum thus conceals a potentially\ninfinite plurality. In antiquity this claim met with the objection\nthat, were one to carry out completely\u2014if only in\nimagination\u2014the process of dividing an extended magnitude, such\nas a continuous line, then the magnitude would be reduced to a\nmultitude of atoms\u2014in this case, extensionless points\u2014or\neven, possibly, to nothing at all. But then, it was held, no matter\nhow many such points there may be\u2014even if infinitely\nmany\u2014they cannot be \u201creassembled\u201d to form the\noriginal magnitude, for surely a sum of extensionless elements still\nlacks\n extension.[3]\n Moreover, if indeed (as seems unavoidable) infinitely many points\nremain after the division, then, following Zeno, the magnitude may be\ntaken to be a (finite) motion, leading to the seemingly absurd\nconclusion that infinitely many points can be \u201ctouched\u201d in\na finite time.\n\nSuch difficulties attended the birth, in the fifth century BCE, of the\nschool of atomism. The founders of this school, Leucippus and\nDemocritus, claimed that matter, and, more generally, extension, is\nnot infinitely divisible. Not only would the successive division of\nmatter ultimately terminate in atoms, that is, in discrete particles\nincapable of being further divided, but matter had in\nactuality to be conceived as being compounded from such atoms. In\nattacking infinite divisibility the atomists were at the same time\nmounting a claim that the continuous is ultimately reducible to the\ndiscrete, whether it be at the physical, theoretical, or perceptual\nlevel.\n\nThe eventual triumph of the atomic theory in physics and chemistry in\nthe nineteenth century paved the way for the idea of\n\u201catomism\u201d, as applying to matter, at least, to become\nwidely familiar: it might well be said, to adapt Sir William\nHarcourt\u2019s famous observation in respect of the socialists of\nhis day, \u201cWe are all atomists now\u201d. Nevertheless, only a\nminority of philosophers of the past espoused atomism at a\nmetaphysical level, a fact which may explain why the analogous\ndoctrine upholding continuity lacks a familiar name: that which is\nunconsciously acknowledged requires no name. Peirce coined the term\nsynechism (from Greek syneche,\n\u201ccontinuous\u201d) for his own philosophy\u2014a philosophy\npermeated by the idea of continuity in its sense of \u201cbeing\n connected\u201d.[4]\n In this article I shall appropriate Peirce\u2019s term and use it in\na sense shorn of its Peircean overtones, simply as a contrary to\natomism. I shall also use the term \u201cdivisionism\u201d for the\nmore specific doctrine that continua are infinitely divisible.\n\nClosely associated with the concept of a continuum is that of\n infinitesimal.[5]\n An infinitesimal magnitude has been somewhat hazily\nconceived as a continuum \u201cviewed in the small\u201d, an\n\u201cultimate part\u201d of a continuum. In something like the same\nsense as a discrete entity is made up of its individual units, its\n\u201cindivisibles\u201d, so, it was maintained, a continuum is\n\u201ccomposed\u201d of infinitesimal magnitudes, its ultimate\nparts. (It is in this sense, for example, that mathematicians of the\nseventeenth century held that continuous curves are\n\u201ccomposed\u201d of infinitesimal straight lines.) Now the\n\u201ccoherence\u201d of a continuum entails that each of its\n(connected) parts is also a continuum, and, accordingly, divisible.\nSince points are indivisible, it follows that no point can be part of\na continuum. Infinitesimal magnitudes, as parts of continua, cannot,\nof necessity, be points: they are, in a word,\nnonpunctiform.\n\nMagnitudes are normally taken as being extensive quantities,\nlike mass or volume, which are defined over extended regions of space.\nBy contrast, infinitesimal magnitudes have been construed as\nintensive magnitudes resembling locally defined intensive\nquantities such as temperature or density. The effect of\n\u201cdistributing\u201d or \u201cintegrating\u201d an intensive\nquantity over such an intensive magnitude is to convert the former\ninto an infinitesimal extensive quantity: thus temperature is\ntransformed into infinitesimal heat and density into infinitesimal\nmass. When the continuum is the trace of a motion, the associated\ninfinitesimal/intensive magnitudes have been identified as\npotential magnitudes\u2014entities which, while not\npossessing true magnitude themselves, possess a tendency to\ngenerate magnitude through motion, so manifesting\n\u201cbecoming\u201d as opposed to \u201cbeing\u201d.\n\nAn infinitesimal number is one which, while not coinciding\nwith zero, is in some sense smaller than any finite number. This sense\nhas often been taken to be the failure to satisfy the Principle of\nArchimedes, which amounts to saying that an infinitesimal number\nis one that, no matter how many times it is added to itself, the\nresult remains less than any finite number. In the engineer\u2019s\npractical treatment of the differential calculus, an infinitesimal is\na number so small that its square and all higher powers can be\nneglected. In the theory of limits the term\n\u201cinfinitesimal\u201d is sometimes applied to any sequence whose\nlimit is zero.\n\nThe concept of an indivisible is closely allied to, but to be\ndistinguished from, that of an infinitesimal. An indivisible is, by\ndefinition, something that cannot be divided, which is usually\nunderstood to mean that it has no proper parts. Now a partless, or\nindivisible entity does not necessarily have to be infinitesimal:\nsouls, individual consciousnesses, and Leibnizian monads all\nsupposedly lack parts but are surely not infinitesimal. But these have\nin common the feature of being unextended; extended entities such as\nlines, surfaces, and volumes prove a much richer source of\n\u201cindivisibles\u201d. Indeed, if the process of dividing such\nentities were to terminate, as the atomists maintained, it would\nnecessarily issue in indivisibles of a qualitatively different nature.\nIn the case of a straight line, such indivisibles would, plausibly, be\npoints; in the case of a circle, straight lines; and in the case of a\ncylinder divided by sections parallel to its base, circles. In each\ncase the indivisible in question is infinitesimal in the sense of\npossessing one fewer dimension than the figure from which it is\ngenerated. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries\nindivisibles in this sense were used in the calculation of areas and\nvolumes of curvilinear figures, a surface or volume being thought of\nas a collection, or sum, of linear, or planar indivisibles\nrespectively.\n\nThe concept of infinitesimal was beset by controversy from its\nbeginnings. The idea makes an early appearance in the mathematics of\nthe Greek atomist philosopher Democritus c. 450 BCE, only to be\nbanished c. 350 BCE by Eudoxus in what was to become official\n\u201cEuclidean\u201d mathematics. We have noted their reappearance\nas indivisibles in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries: in this\nform they were systematically employed by Kepler, Galileo\u2019s\nstudent Cavalieri, the Bernoulli clan, and a number of other\nmathematicians. In the guise of the beguilingly named\n\u201clinelets\u201d and \u201ctimelets\u201d, infinitesimals\nplayed an essential role in Barrow\u2019s \u201cmethod for finding\ntangents by calculation\u201d (1670 [1916: 119]), which appears in\nhis Lectiones Geometricae of 1670. As \u201cevanescent\nquantities\u201d infinitesimals were instrumental (although later\nabandoned) in Newton\u2019s development of the calculus, and, as\n\u201cinassignable quantities\u201d, in Leibniz\u2019s. The Marquis\nde L\u2019H\u00f4pital, who in 1696 published the first treatise on\nthe differential calculus (entitled Analyse des Infiniments Petits\npour l\u2019Intelligence des Lignes Courbes), invokes the\nconcept in postulating that \u201ca curved line may be regarded as\nbeing made up of infinitely small straight line segments\u201d (1696:\n3 [Postulate II]), and that \u201cone can take as equal two\nquantities differing by an infinitely small quantity\u201d (1696: 2\n[Postulate 1]).\n\nHowever useful it may have been in practice, the concept of\ninfinitesimal could scarcely withstand logical scrutiny. Derided by\nBerkeley in the eighteenth century as \u201cGhosts of departed\nQuantities\u201d (1734: 59), in the nineteenth century execrated by\nCantor as \u201ccholera-bacilli\u201d infecting mathematics (1893\n[1965: 505], translated by Fisher 1981: 116), and in the twentieth\nroundly condemned by Bertrand Russell as \u201cunnecessary,\nerroneous, and self-contradictory\u201d (1903: 345), these useful,\nbut logically dubious entities were believed to have been finally\nsupplanted in the foundations of analysis by the limit concept which\ntook rigorous and final form in the latter half of the nineteenth\ncentury. By the beginning of the twentieth century, the concept of\ninfinitesimal had become, in analysis at least, a virtual\n\u201cunconcept\u201d.\n\nNevertheless the proscription of infinitesimals did not succeed in\nextirpating them; they were, rather, driven further underground.\nPhysicists and engineers, for example, never abandoned their use as a\nheuristic device for the derivation of correct results in the\napplication of the calculus to physical problems. Differential\ngeometers of the stature of Sophus Lie and \u00c9lie Cartan relied on\ntheir use in the formulation of concepts which would later be put on a\n\u201crigorous\u201d footing. And, in a technical sense, they lived\non in the algebraists\u2019 investigations of non-Archimedean\nfields.\n\nA new phase in the long contest between the continuous and the\ndiscrete has opened in the past few decades with the refounding of the\nconcept of infinitesimal on a solid basis. This has been achieved in\ntwo essentially different ways, the one providing a rigorous\nformulation of the idea of infinitesimal number, the other of\ninfinitesimal magnitude.\n\nFirst, in the 1960s Abraham Robinson, using methods of mathematical\nlogic, created nonstandard analysis, an extension of\nmathematical analysis embracing both \u201cinfinitely large\u201d\nand infinitesimal numbers in which the usual laws of the arithmetic of\nreal numbers continue to hold, an idea which, in essence, goes back to\nLeibniz. Here by an infinitely large number is meant one which exceeds\nevery positive integer; the reciprocal of any one of these is\ninfinitesimal in the sense that, while being nonzero, it is smaller\nthan every positive fraction \\(1/n\\). Much of the usefulness of\nnonstandard analysis stems from the fact that within it every\nstatement of ordinary analysis involving limits has a succinct and\nhighly intuitive translation into the language of infinitesimals.\n\nThe second development in the refounding of the concept of\ninfinitesimal took place in the 1970s with the emergence of\nsynthetic differential geometry, also known as smooth\ninfinitesimal analysis. Based on the ideas of the American\nmathematician F. W. Lawvere, and employing the methods of category\ntheory, smooth infinitesimal analysis provides an image of the world\nin which the continuous is an autonomous notion, not explicable in\nterms of the discrete. It provides a rigorous framework for\nmathematical analysis in which every function between spaces is smooth\n(i.e., differentiable arbitrarily many times, and so in particular\ncontinuous) and in which the use of limits in defining the basic\nnotions of the calculus is replaced by nilpotent\ninfinitesimals, that is, of quantities so small (but not actually\nzero) that some power\u2014most usefully, the square\u2014vanishes.\nSmooth infinitesimal analysis embodies a concept of intensive\nmagnitude in the form of infinitesimal tangent vectors to\ncurves. A tangent vector to a curve at a point \\(p\\) on it is a short\nstraight line segment \\(l\\) passing through the point and pointing\nalong the curve. In fact we may take \\(l\\) actually to be an\ninfinitesimal part of the curve. Curves in smooth\ninfinitesimal analysis are \u201clocally straight\u201d and\naccordingly may be conceived as being \u201ccomposed of\u201d\ninfinitesimal straight lines in de L\u2019H\u00f4pital\u2019s\nsense, or as being \u201cgenerated\u201d by an infinitesimal tangent\nvector.\n\nThe development of nonstandard and smooth infinitesimal analysis has\nbreathed new life into the concept of infinitesimal,\nand\u2014especially in connection with smooth infinitesimal\nanalysis\u2014supplied novel insights into the nature of the\ncontinuum.\n",
