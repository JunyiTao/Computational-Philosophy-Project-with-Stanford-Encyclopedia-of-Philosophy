    "main_text": "Justice and Public Health || Aggregation, Goal Setting and Resource Allocation\n2.2 Aggregation, Goal Setting and Resource Allocation\n\nAs we noted in Section 1.1, a defining characteristic of public health\nis that it is committed to advancing health at the level of\npopulations. Public health relies on aggregated measures of health to\nidentify health deficits, set health policy priorities, assess the\nimpact of interventions, and allocate resources. It is this reliance\non aggregation that sets the stage for numerous questions of justice\nin public health, including perhaps most prominently tensions between\negalitarian approaches to justice and efficiency-oriented utilitarian\napproaches.\n2.2.1 Justice and Natural Units Measures of Population Health\n\nAlthough many challenges in aggregation taken up in the justice and\npublic health literature relate to or are compounded by the way\nsummary measures of health are constructed and deployed, even the\nsimplest of health measures, once aggregated, raise justice concerns.\nTraditionally in public health, and still today, health outcomes are\noften measured in what are sometimes called natural units; examples\ninclude life expectancy, mortality, five-year survival, and\nimmunization rates. These natural units are typically expressed in\nterms of averages, as in average life expectancy of American men,\nalthough sometimes medians or other ways of presenting the data are\nused. The problem is that, aggregated over a population, any of these\nnatural measures can obscure differences within the population that\nare morally relevant. To continue with the example of average life\nexpectancy of American men, focusing only on that measure obscures\ndifferences between white men and men of color, rural and urban men,\nand poorly and well-educated men that many view as mattering morally,\nand as potential injustices. Reliance on average summary measures of\nthings like income or education can also have implications for public\nhealth ethics. To take a classic example, averaged national income\ndata have been used as the basis for determining which countries are\neligible for international philanthropic assistance in accessing\nlifesaving vaccines. Because this approach resulted in the withholding\nof global vaccine aid from middle-income countries, it was criticized\nas perpetuating injustices. In middle-income countries with large\nincome inequalities, average income data obscured truly disadvantaged\nsub-populations who were not likely to receive the vaccine without\nglobal assistance. (Shebaya, Sutherland, Levine, and Faden 2010) One\njob of public health ethics is to stay attuned to the risk that\naveraged outcome measures and statistics can mask differences between\nsubgroups within a population that point to unjust inequalities in\nneed of redress.\n\nAt the same time, whether or how much group differences in aggregated\nnatural measures of health matter morally is not necessarily obvious\nand may depend on the account of justice under\n consideration.[5]\n Any sub-group difference in a natural measure of health suggests that\nit may be possible to secure more health for more people than is\ncurrently the case, a goal underscored by the public health\u2019s\nutilitarian commitments. However, whether any group difference is also\nunjust from an egalitarian perspective cannot be read off of the\nexistence or even the size of a between-group disparity. Theories of\njustice, or more directly accounts of injustice, are needed to fill in\nthe gap between observing an inequality in health between groups and\ndeciding whether or how egregiously the inequality constitutes an\ninjustice. (Powers and Faden 2006, pp. 95\u201399)\n2.2.2 Justice and Summary Measures of Population Health\n\nFrom the standpoint of public health policymaking, there are several\nother problems with natural measures of population health, like life\nexpectancy or infant survival rates. These measures cannot provide a\nsummary picture of the overall state of health or burden of ill health\nof a population, nor do they allow for comparison of the value or\nimpact of alternative investments in different health priorities. The\nlatter is a particular problem for allocating health budgets and\nsetting priorities for funding. Although classic cost-benefit analysis\nprovides a solution that admits of comparisons across diverse health\nareas and outcomes, reducing all the benefits and risks at issue in\npublic health to their monetary value is widely viewed as\nunsatisfactory. In response, a series of summary measures of\npopulation health have been developed that seek to reduce into one\nfungible metric both life expectancy and considerations of impact of\ndisease and of medical interventions on function and disability.\nOperating out of the preference-satisfaction tradition, well-known\nsummary metrics include Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs),\nDisability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), Disability-Adjusted Life\nExpectancy (DALE) and Healthy Life Year (HeaLY). Summary measures have\nbeen subject to extensive ethics critique. (See the entry on\n disability and health care rationing.)\n Some of these criticisms reflect difficulties with conceptualizing\nand operationalizing utility accounts of welfare. For example, these\nmeasures sometimes rely on assessments of what may be only vague\nindividual preferences for trade-offs between different states of\nhealth or different kinds of benefits, or trade-offs made by samples\nof persons that are viewed as too narrow. These summary measures have\nalso been critiqued to the extent that they rely on average trade-off\nassessments that may mask wide disagreement about the disvalue of a\ncompromised health state.\n\nOther criticisms focus on different, egalitarian-oriented justice\nconcerns about morally contentious assumptions embedded in the\nmeasures, including whether to differentially value years saved in\ndifferent stages of life and how to disvalue specific disabilities.\nDepending on how these and other assumptions are determined and\nspecified, summary health measures have been criticized as being\nageist or not ageist enough, as discriminating unfairly against people\nwith disabilities, as failing to capture the moral uniqueness of\nlifesaving, and as treating as commensurable qualitatively different\nlosses and benefits. (Brock 2002, 2006; Daniels 2008; Kappel and\nSandoe 1992; Nord 2005; Powers and Faden 2006; Ubel 1999; Williams\n2001; Whitehead and Ali 2010; Soares 2012; Pettit et al. 2016;\nSchroeder 2017).\n\nA particularly influential deployment of the DALY summary measure of\npopulation health is the Burden of Disease Project. Supported by the\nWorld Health Organization, national burden of disease studies are\nconducted in many nations and are widely relied on to help\ncharacterize the state of ill health globally as well as within\ncountries. Ethical concerns about DALYs and global disease studies,\noften discussed in the public health literature under the heading of\nsocial issues, include whether DALYs should be age-weighted or\ntime-discounted. Because the results of global burden of disease\nstudies can be influential in the setting of health priorities, they\nillustrate well the importance of the ethics of summary measures in\npublic health practice. \n2.2.3 Efficiency vs. Equity\n\nMuch of the literature in public health ethics that has addressed\nsummary measures has looked at their role in cost-utility\n analysis.[6]\n In cost-utility analysis, a summary measure is used to identify how\nto secure the most health for the resources available. The goal is to\nestablish comparative value for money, with an eye to ensuring\nefficiency in resource allocation. In addition to ethical concerns\nabout the construction of summary measures and the assumptions on\nwhich they are built, cost-utility analysis raises additional concerns\nof justice because it, like cost-benefit analysis and utilitarian\ntheorizing more generally, is indifferent to questions of\ndistribution. As a contingent matter, it is often the case that public\nhealth interventions that are good value-for-money advance the health\nof disadvantaged groups relative to their powerful counterparts. This\nis because a little money can often go a long way towards improving\nthe health of those who have relatively little and whose health\nprospects are bleak. Consider, for example, investing in childhood\nimmunizations and vitamin supplementation in low- and middle-income\ncountries. That said, the worry remains that when public health policy\nrests on cost-utility analyses, the resultant priorities or\nallocations may entail injustices of various sorts. For example,\npolicymaking that is mainly or largely driven by cost-utility findings\nmay perpetuate or even exacerbate existing unjust health disparities\nwhen health gains are more efficiently secured for those who are\nbetter off or fail to treat fairly the needs of persons with rare\ndiseases, diseases with poor outcomes, and diseases that are very\nexpensive to prevent or treat.\n\nIn large part in response to these difficulties with cost-benefit\nanalysis and treating maximization as the relevant principle, scholars\nin public health ethics have defended alternative principles of\ndistribution. These principles mirror familiar debates in the\nliterature on distributive justice. Although some theorists argue for\nsome form of equality in the distribution of health-related resources\n(Marmot 2005; Wilkinson 2005), including equality of opportunities\n(Daniels 2004, 2008), much of the literature is taken up with debates\nbetween prioritarianism and sufficientarianism. Defenders of\nprioritarianism claim that while the overall goal of distribution\nshould be the promotion of the health of the population, extra\nweighting or priority should be placed on the distributing resources\nin ways that promote the health needs of those who are worst-off\n(Parfit 1997; Ottersen et al. 2008; Ottersen, M\u00e6stad, and\nNorheim, 2014). How to conceptualize who the worst-off are for\npurposes of public health policymaking remains contested territory. By\ncontrast, those defending sufficientarianism maintain that a\npreferable distributional principle for health resources is helping to\nensure that all persons experience or can achieve a certain threshold\nof health or health capabilities (see Nussbaum 2006; Powers and Faden\n2006; Fourie and Rid 2017). On this view, a world in which everyone\nreaches a threshold for health capabilities or health states is more\njust than a world in which average population health exceeds that\nthreshold but some subgroups do not reach it. A challenge here is\nconceptualizing and then operationalizing how much health or health\ncapability counts as sufficient.\n\nThe challenges posed by the efficiency vs. equity tension in public\nhealth cannot be overstated (Daniels 2019). For example, in the United\nStates, infant mortality rates are higher than in many other wealthy\nnations, and they are higher still among poor and minority children.\nSome state public health authorities have made reducing racial\ndisparities in infant mortality a top priority, accepting the view\nthat redressing this unjust inequality is an urgent moral concern.\nOther states have chosen the goal of improving infant survival\nstatistics overall, on the grounds that the same resources will\nproduce greater aggregate health outcomes while at the same time\npointing to the special place that all children should hold in public\nhealth policy (HRSA 2014 in Other Internet Resources). It is not clear\nthat theorizing about just distribution in health does or could\nprovide definitive guidance as to which policy is more just.\n\nEquity and efficiency frequently sit side by side in public health\npolicymaking. Countries often explicitly include a range of diverse\nhealth equity objectives in national public health goals (Krubiner and\nFaden 2017). Several approaches have been put forward to assist\npolicymakers who do not want to lose sight of these objectives as they\nalso aim to be efficient in the use of the limited resources available\nfor population health. One major concern is that cost-utility and\ncost-effectiveness can have an outsized influence on policymaking\nbecause the quantitative character of their results convey a kind of\npseudo-scientific certainty or otherwise seem to provide an\nevidence-based grounding for what policymakers should do. To combat\nthis concern, which of course is a risk in policymaking generally,\nsome have argued the importance of treating CEA and CUA findings only\nas aids to decision-making that policymakers should take into account,\nbut always in concert with other sources of relevant information,\nincluding explicit ethics analysis.\n\nSeveral ethics frameworks directed at assisting policymakers in taking\nthis broader perspective attempt to incorporate both value-for-money\nand other justice-based commitments in one guidance document (see\nOttersen et al. 2014). Relatedly, there is increasing interest in\nmulti-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) in public health, a formalized\nmethodology in the operations research tradition that allows for\nsystematic attention to a range of considerations inclusive of both\nefficiency and equity criteria. There is also continuing interest in\nincorporating equity- based concerns directly into formal economic\nmethods, sometimes referred to as cost-value analysis. (Distefano and\nLevin 2019) Each of these different strategies to blunting the\ninfluence of cost-utility analysis in the service of more just\npolicymaking is subject to different criticisms. For example,\nstrategies that emphasize underscoring to policymakers that they\nbroaden their scope of relevant inputs, including with the aid of\npurpose-built ethics frameworks, are challenged for failing to\nappreciate how numbers-oriented policymaking actually is. Conversely,\nstrategies that incorporate empiricized versions of ethical\nconsiderations into economic methods and some quantitative MCDA\napproaches are open to critiques about making commensurable that which\nis not, and also obscuring from political and public view what is\nmorally at stake, including where there are moral disagreements that\nbear on the policy decision.\n2.2.4 Absolute Scarcity\n\nAs we have already noted, financial resources are always limited in\npublic health. There is never enough money in the public health sector\nto pursue all the policies and practices that could advance population\nhealth. Although arguably a redistribution of resources among\ncompeting public sectors, for example from a country\u2019s defense\nbudget to its health budget, may be ethically warranted and could\nrelieve some of the more pressing constraints, tough priority setting\nand allocation decisions are a constant feature of policymaking in\npublic health and are likely ineliminable. There are also occasions in\npublic health, however, when money is not the primary constraint and\nquestions of just distribution can take on somewhat different\nfeatures. Sometimes referred to as cases of absolute scarcity or of\nextreme rationing, an urgently needed intervention is in short supply,\nand the supply problem cannot be fixed in real-time simply by\nallocating more money to the\n problem.[7]\n A classic example is countermeasures for epidemic diseases, where\nproduction of the countermeasure, typically a vaccine, lags behind the\nneed. In these cases, standard debates between efficiency and various\nalternative distributive principles can take on new twists or are\naugmented by appeals to somewhat different principles. For example,\nwhen epidemic vaccines are in short supply many judge that health\nprofessionals and other first responders should enjoy high priority\nfor receiving a vaccine. The rationale for this position appeals to a\nmix of utilitarian and non-utilitarian reasons. Some see the relevant\ndistributive principle to be a combination of contribution and\nreciprocity; because these people are putting themselves at increased\nrisk of acquiring the infection, literally putting their lives on the\nline for others, first responders are entitled to special\nconsideration in access to preventive interventions. At the same time,\nthe argument is also made that the public health system needs these\nexperts to be both willing and able to perform their duties and thus\nthat it is important to use guaranteed access to a scarce vaccine to\nboth incentivize first responders to work on the public\u2019s behalf\nand to keep them healthy.\n\nMany cases of absolute scarcity lie at the intersection of public\nhealth and clinical ethics and, depending on the national health\nsystem, maybe more or less under public health authorities to resolve.\nThese include the deployment of antivirals and ICU beds during an\ninfluenza pandemic but also the allocation of solid organs or of\ncancer drugs that are in short supply because of production challenges\n(Unguru et al. 2014). Consider the case of solid organs. Simple\nnotions of fairness might suggest that scarce life-saving organs be\ndistributed randomly among a pool of those in need or on a first-come,\nfirst-served basis (Arras 2005; Broome 1984; Silverman and Chalmers\n2001). However, if, for example, either of these principles resulted\nin an 85-year-old being selected over a ten-year-old, objections could\nbe mounted from a utilitarian, QALY or DALY perspective. Objections\ncould also be mounted from what is sometimes called the \u201cfair\ninnings\u201d perspective in which a priority is placed on ensuring\nthat people survive to experience the later stages of life before\nanyone who has already experienced those stages is assisted. Competing\nconcepts of fair chances and just outcomes have dominated this\nliterature, and complex national systems have developed to allocate\nsolid organs that generally rely on a mix of distributive principles.\nThe Complete Lives System is one attempt to integrate several\nprinciples in one general strategy for allocating scarce resources\n(Persad, Wertheimer, and Emanuel 2009), while other integrated,\nmulti-principle strategies have been proposed for the allocation of\nparticular kinds of scarce resources like ventilators in the context\nof pandemic influenza (Daugherty Biddison et al. 2018).\n2.2.5 Distribution of Health Burdens\n\nThus far, we have focused on questions of justice in priority setting\nand allocation of resources intended to improve health. The\ninterventions the resources support often carry with them harms or\nrisks, but these generally fall on the persons and groups who benefit\nfrom them. However, there are also contexts in public health where the\nbenefits and harms do not fall on the same groups, raising somewhat\ndifferent questions of justice. One example is Japan\u2019s seasonal\ninfluenza immunization policy between 1962 and 1994, where children\nwere immunized against influenza explicitly in order to protect the\nelderly, for whom contracting seasonal flu is more likely to be fatal,\nand immunization more likely to be burdensome (Reichert et al. 2001;\nSugaya 2014). Another example of public health interventions that\nappear to be guided by this reasoning is rubella vaccination. Rubella\nis a disease that causes only mild illness except if contracted by\npregnant women, where rubella can result in miscarriage or serious\nbirth defects. In many countries in the world, children are routinely\nimmunized for the sake of pregnant women and their fetuses (Miller et\nal. 1997; ACIP 2010 in Other Internet Resources). The question raised\nhere is whether it is ethically acceptable for some groups within the\npopulation to be asked or required to take on risks, even minimal\nones, in order to assist other groups in the population who cannot be\ndirectly protected. One argument appeals to reciprocity. In the case\nof rubella immunization, the children vaccinated today were spared the\nrisks of in utero exposure to rubella because children before them\nwere similarly vaccinated. (Of course, this rationale does not apply\nto the very first cohort of children who received the rubella\nvaccine.) Another argument is that the imposition of risk on some in\norder to protect the health of others is justified in order to make\nthe overall distribution of disease burden in the population more\nequitable. This more general argument can explain why individuals are\nsometimes asked to bear public health burdens that do not directly\nbenefit them. However, as with the case of taxes, the question of how\nfar we can go in redistributing health-related burdens will likely\ncontinue to plague any proponent of this justificatory strategy.\nMoreover, questions about the plausibility of viewing health-related\nburdens as subject to distribution in this manner may also arise.\n",
