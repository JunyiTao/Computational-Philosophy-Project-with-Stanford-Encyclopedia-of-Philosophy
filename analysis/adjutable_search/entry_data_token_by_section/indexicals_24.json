    "main_text": "Indexical Belief and Indexical Semantics || Other Views of Indexical Belief (and Indexical Semantics)\n4.5 Other Views of Indexical Belief (and Indexical Semantics)\n\n\nMany philosophers have presented alternative theories of indexical\nbelief, sometimes along with alternative theories of indexical\nsemantics.\n\n\nGottlob Frege (1997b) holds that each agent can think of himself or\nherself via a sense that no other agent can grasp. Other aspects of\nFrege\u2019s views on indexicals are the subjects of interpretive\ncontroversy. For discussion, see Perry (1977, 1979), Evans (1985),\nKripke (2011), and Burge (2012).\n\n\nSchiffer (1978, 1981) holds that each agent can believe a singular\nproposition about herself, but cannot believe a singular proposition about\nany other object. All belief that is seemingly about other objects\nreduces to descriptive belief. Nevertheless, he holds that the correct\nsemantics for indexicals is a direct-reference theory. Schiffer\u2019s\nview of indexical belief is quite similar to Lewis\u2019s and\nChisholm\u2019s, as Austin (1990) points out. Austin offers criticisms\nof Schiffer\u2019s view that parallel his criticisms of Lewis\u2019s\nand Chisholm\u2019s views.\n\n\nEvans (1985) holds (roughly) that agents with indexical beliefs\nbelieve singular propositions that have the characters of indexicals as\nconstituents. For example, a person who utters \u2018He is making a\nmess\u2019, while pointing at John, believes a proposition that has as\nconstituents John, the relation of demonstrating, and the property of\nmaking a mess. For discussion, see Perry 2000.\n\n\nFor other views on indexical belief, see Casta\u00f1eda 1966,\n1967; Stalnaker 1981, 2008; and Ninan 2013.\n",
