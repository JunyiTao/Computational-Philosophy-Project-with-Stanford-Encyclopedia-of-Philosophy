    "main_text": "Pyrrhonian Skepticism\n5. Pyrrhonian Skepticism\n\nWe turn now to Pyrrhonian\n Skepticism.[17]\n We remind the reader that our main interest here is not historical\n(for which see the entry on\n ancient skepticism),\n but rather systematic: we want to canvass the legacy of Pyrrhonian\nSkepticism for contemporary epistemology, and in so doing we set aside\neven the most cursory exegetical interest.\n\nRecall that, according to Pyrrhonian Skepticism, suspension of\njudgment is the only justified attitude with respect to any\nproposition (yes, including the proposition that suspension of\njudgment is the only justified attitude with respect to any\nproposition). We are interested here in whether there are good\narguments for such a view. We begin by recalling the tri-partite\ndistinction between belief, disbelief and suspension of judgment. If\nwe identify disbelief in a proposition with belief in its negation,\nthen we are left with two attitudes within the realm of coarse-grained\nepistemology: belief and suspension of judgment. We assume also that\nthe arguments to follow are addressed to someone who has an interest\nin, and has considered, the propositions in question. Otherwise, there\nis always the possibility of not taking any attitude whatsoever\ntowards a proposition. Such lack of an attitude cannot itself be\n(epistemically) justified or not. But if the subject is to take an\nattitude, then the argument for Pyrrhonian Skepticism has it that\nsuspension of judgment is the only justified one.\n\nThe Pyrrhonian skeptics sought suspension of judgment as a way of\nachieving calm (ataraxia) in the face of seemingly\nintractable disagreement. The Pyrrhonians had a number of ways, or\n\u201cmodes\u201d, to induce suspension of judgment. The importance\nof Pyrrhonian Skepticism to contemporary epistemology derives\nprimarily from these modes, and in particular from a subset of them\nreferred to collectively as \u201cthe modes of Agrippa\u201d. There\nare five modes associated with Agrippa, but three of them are the most\nimportant: the mode of hypothesis (or unsupported assertion), the mode\nof circularity (\u201creciprocal\u201d), and the mode of regression\nto infinity. The three modes of Agrippa function together in the\nfollowing way. Whenever the dogmatist (Sextus refers to those who are\nnot skeptics as \u201cdogmatists\u201d, and we will follow him in\nthis) asserts his belief in a proposition \\(p_1\\), the Pyrrhonian will\nchallenge that assertion, asking the dogmatist to justify \\(p_1\\), to\ngive reasons for thinking that it is true. The dogmatist will then\neither decline to answer the challenge or adduce another proposition\n\\(p_2\\) in support of \\(p_1\\). If the dogmatist refuses to answer the\nchallenge, the Pyrrhonian will be satisfied that the only justified\nattitude to take with respect to \\(p_1\\) is to suspend judgment,\nbecause no reason for it has been given (thus appealing to the mode of\nhypothesis). If the dogmatist adduces another proposition \\(p_2\\) in\nsupport of \\(p_1\\), then either \\(p_2\\) will be identical to \\(p_1\\)\nor it will be a different proposition. If \\(p_2\\) is the same\nproposition as \\(p_1\\), then the Pyrrhonian will also suspend judgment\nwith respect to \\(p_1\\), because no proposition can support itself\n(thus appealing to the mode of circularity). If, on the other hand,\n\\(p_2\\) is different from \\(p_1\\), then the Pyrrhonian will ask the\ndogmatist to justify his assertion of \\(p_2\\). And now either the\ndogmatist offers no reason in support of \\(p_2\\), or offers \\(p_2\\)\nitself or \\(p_1\\) as a reason, or adduces yet another proposition\n\\(p_3\\), different from both \\(p_1\\) and \\(p_2\\). If the dogmatist\noffers no reason for \\(p_2\\), then the Pyrrhonian will invoke the mode\nof hypothesis again and suspend judgment in accordance with it; if\neither \\(p_2\\) itself or \\(p_1\\) are offered as reasons to believe in\n\\(p_1\\), then the Pyrrhonian will invoke the mode of circularity and\nsuspend judgment in accordance with it (because not only can no\nproposition be a reason for believing in itself, but also no genuine\nchain of reasons can loop); and, finally, if the dogmatist offers yet\nanother proposition \\(p_3\\), different from both \\(p_1\\) and \\(p_2\\),\nas a reason to believe \\(p_2\\), then the same three possibilities that\narose with respect to \\(p_2\\) will arise with respect to \\(p_3\\). The\ndogmatist will not be able to continue offering different propositions\nin response to the Pyrrhonian challenge forever\u2014eventually,\neither no reason will be offered, or a proposition that has already\nmade an appearance will be mentioned again. The Pyrrhonian refers to\nthis impossibility of actually offering a different proposition each\ntime a reason is needed as \u201cthe mode of infinite\nregression\u201d. The three Pyrrhonian modes, then, work in tandem in\norder to induce suspension of judgment with respect to any proposition\nwhatsoever.\n\nThe Pyrrhonian use of the three modes of Agrippa in order to induce\nsuspension of judgment can be presented in the form of an argument,\nwhich has been called \u201cAgrippa\u2019s trilemma\u201d. It is at\nleast somewhat misleading to present the Pyrrhonian position in terms\nof an argument, because when someone presents an argument they are\nusually committed to the truth of its premises and its conclusion,\nwhereas Pyrrhonian skeptics would suspend judgment with respect to\nthem. Nevertheless, presenting an argument for Pyrrhonian Skepticism\ndoesn\u2019t do much violence to this skeptical position, because\nwhat is important is not whether the Pyrrhonians themselves accept the\npremises or the validity of the argument, but rather whether\nwe do. If we do, then it seems that we ourselves should be\nPyrrhonian skeptics (and if we do become Pyrrhonian skeptics as a\nresult of this argument, we can then start worrying about what to do\nwith respect to the fact that an argument whose premises we\nbelieved\u2014and perhaps still believe\u2014to be true convinced us\nthat we are not justified in believing anything). If we do not think\nthat the argument is sound, then we stand to learn something\ninteresting about the structure of an epistemological\ntheory\u2014because each of the premises of the apparently valid\nargument looks plausible at first sight.\n\nBefore presenting a reconstruction of Agrippa\u2019s trilemma we need\nto introduce some definitions. Let\u2019s say that a belief is\ninferentially justified if and only if it is justified (at\nleast in part) in virtue of its relations to other beliefs. A\njustified basic belief, by contrast, is a belief that is\njustified but not in virtue of its relations to other beliefs. An\ninferential chain is a set of beliefs such that every member\nof the set is allegedly related to at least one other member by the\nrelation \u201cis justified by\u201d. Agrippa\u2019s trilemma,\nthen, can be presented thus:\n\n\n If a belief is justified, then it is either a basic justified\nbelief or an inferentially justified belief.\n There are no basic justified beliefs.\n\n\nTherefore,\n\n If a belief is justified, then it is justified in virtue of\nbelonging to an inferential chain.\n All inferential chains are such that either (a) they contain an\ninfinite number of beliefs; or (b) they contain circles; or (c) they\ncontain beliefs that are not justified.\n No belief is justified in virtue of belonging to an infinite\ninferential chain.\n No belief is justified in virtue of belonging to a circular\ninferential chain.\n No belief is justified in virtue of belonging to an inferential\nchain that contains unjustified beliefs.\n\n\nTherefore,\n\n There are no justified beliefs.\n\n\n\nPremise 1 is beyond reproach, given our previous definitions. Premise\n2 is justified by the mode of hypothesis. Step 3 of the argument\nfollows from premises 1 and 2. Premise 4 is also beyond\nreproach\u2014the only remaining possible structure for an\ninferential chain to have is to contain basic justified beliefs, but\nthere are none of those according to premise 2. Premise 5 is justified\nby appeal to the mode of infinite regression, and premise 6 is\njustified by appeal to the mode of circularity. Premise 7 might seem\nto be a truism, but we will have to take a closer look at it.\n\nIt is interesting to note that Agrippa\u2019s trilemma is perfectly\ngeneral; in particular, it applies to philosophical positions as well\nas to ordinary propositions. In fact, when Agrippa\u2019s trilemma is\napplied to epistemological theories themselves, the result is what has\nbeen called \u201cthe problem of the criterion\u201d (see Chisholm\n1973).\n\nMany contemporary epistemological positions can be stated as a\nreaction to Agrippa\u2019s trilemma. In fact, all of premises 2, 5, 6\nand 7 have been rejected by different philosophers at one time or\nanother. We examine those responses in what follows.\n",
