Moreover, if something is overall bad for us wholly by virtue of\nmaking us have things that are intrinsically bad for us, we can say\nthat it makes us worse off while we have those evils. For example,\ncoming to be infected with a flu virus is overall bad for us, and the\ntime it makes us worse off is not when we come to be infected, but\nrather while we are sick, while we suffer. (If we came to be infected\nwith a virus, and our immune system dealt with it, preventing our\nbecoming sick, the infection would not be bad for us.) This line of\nthought suggests that a painful death makes us worse off\nwhile we die, or rather while dying is painful for us. What about a\npainless death? Might it also be bad for us? (If so, when are we made\nworse off?) Perhaps; more on that in a bit.\n\nWe can use the term concurrentism for the view that a bad\ndeath makes us worse off while we die.\n",
