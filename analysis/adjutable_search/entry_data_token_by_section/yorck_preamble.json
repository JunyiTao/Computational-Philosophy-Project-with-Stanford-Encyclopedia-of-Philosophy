    "main_text": "\n\nCount Hans Ludwig Paul Yorck von Wartenburg (1835\u20131897) was a\nGerman philosopher. He is primarily known for his long collaboration\nwith his friend Wilhelm Dilthey (1833\u20131911) and for his impact\non Martin Heidegger (1889\u20131976) and Hans-Georg Gadamer\n(1900\u20132002). Together with Dilthey, Yorck was the first\nphilosopher to elaborate the specific concept of historicity\n[Geschichtlichkeit] as a defining characteristic in the\nontology of human beings. In particular, Yorck emphasized\nthe generic difference between the ontic and the historical,\ni.e., the difference between what is seen or conceptualized (or\naesthetically contemplated) as permanent nature, or essence, or idea,\nand the felt historical rhythm of life, i.e., life\u2019s immersion\nin and belonging to the overarching and always changing waves of\nhistory. In contradistinction to Dilthey\u2019s epistemological\nendeavors to clarify the foundations of the historical sciences\nvis-\u00e0-vis the natural sciences, Yorck aimed exclusively at the\nontology of historical life, particularly the historical band\n(syndesmos) and effective connection (virtuality)\nthat unites generational life. Based on the primacy of historical\nlife, Yorck adopted a decidedly anti-metaphysical stance, rejecting\nall claims of knowledge sub specie aeternitatis. He combined\nthis with a Christian, particularly Lutheran, conception of a\nhistorical and personal but entirely transcendent God, relative to\nwhom each individual person, in inescapable singularity, defines his\nor her own life story. Yorck\u2019s ideas were first made public in\nthe form of a posthumous volume of his Correspondence with\nDilthey in 1923 (Yorck 1923). Through this publication he influenced\nnot only Heidegger (see Farin 2016, Fagniez 2013, Dastur 2011, Ruin\n1994) and Gadamer (1990), but also Misch, Rothacker, Scholem,\nBultmann, Marcuse, and others. Between 1956 and 1970 various\nunfinished fragments of Yorck\u2019s writings were published (see\n Bibliography).\n They contain the outline of Yorck\u2019s systematic psychology of\nhistory and history of philosophy, as well as extensive reflections on\nthe partial negation or suppression of temporality in thought and\nmetaphysics (due to the inherently spatial character of representation\nand thought as such). These later works have not received as much\nattention as his earlier views in his Correspondence with\nDilthey.\n",
