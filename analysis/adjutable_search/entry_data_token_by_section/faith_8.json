Faith and hope\n\nSome philosophers have suggested that the epistemological challenges\nfaced by accounts of faith as involving belief beyond the evidence may\nbe avoided by construing theist commitment as hope. Theist hope seems\nnot to be mere tenacity (\u2018clinging to one\u2019s hopes\u2019)\n(Taylor 1961), but a more complex attitude. James Muyskens suggests,\nfor example, that one who hopes \u2018keep[s] his life open or fluid\nwith respect to [a faith-proposition] p\u2014where (a)\nneither p nor not-p is certain for him, (b) he wants\np and (c) he sees p as constructively connected with\nhis own well-being and/or concept of himself as a person\u2019 (1979,\n35). Muyskens contrasts hope with faith (understood as belief),\narguing that a religion of hope is both epistemically and religiously\nsuperior to a religion of faith. But faith is not generally understood\nas competing with hope (Creel 1993), and some philosophers\nidentify faith with hoping that the claims of faith are true\n(Pojman 1986; 2003). Hope as such is an attitude rather than an active\ncommitment, and, as Audi observes, it contrasts with the attitude of\nfaith at least in this respect, namely, that surprise makes little\nsense as a response to discovering that the object of one\u2019s\nfaith is indeed the case, whereas there need be nothing inappropriate\nin surprise at the fulfilment of one\u2019s hopes (see Audi 2011,\n74).\n\nA more adequate model of faith as hope, then, may rather take faith to\nbe acting in, or from, hope. Such a model then comes close to\na non-doxastic venture model of faith, differing only in so far as\nacting from hope that God exists differs from taking this claim to be\ntrue (albeit without belief) in one\u2019s practical reasoning, but\nthis difference may be undetectable at the level of behavioral\noutcomes (see McKaughan 2013). A model of faith as acting in hope\nshares with the doxastic and non-doxastic venture models in rejecting\nthe view that faith requires cognitive certainty. But one can act in\nhope with firmness and resilience, given a strong affective/evaluative\nstance, even if one lacks belief that one\u2019s hopes will be\nfulfilled. Hoping that p, however, does not involve taking a\nstand on its being true that p, which is widely thought to be\nessential to faith.\n\nThe \u2018venture\u2019 models of faith (with or without belief) and\nthe model of faith as a venture in hope all fit the view that faith is\nconsistent with doubt, and, indeed, impossible without doubt of some\nkind, though they allow that persons who have faith may give firm and\nsustained commitment to the truth of faith-propositions in practice\n(for discussion of different kinds of doubt and their compatibility or\nincompatibility with faith and belief see Howard-Snyder 2013b, 359).\nThe \u2018certainty\u2019 of faith on these models is more a matter\nof the certainty that persons of faith find themselves\nconferring on the foundational claims of their faith, rather\nthan a matter of discovering in themselves a certain knowledge or\nintellectual conviction of the truth of these claims. It is possible,\nthen, on these accounts of faith, to be a committed person of faith\nand also an \u2018agnostic\u2019 in Thomas Huxley\u2019s original\nsense of someone who does not claim as knowledge the commitments he or\nshe nevertheless makes as a foundational practical orientation to\nreality.
