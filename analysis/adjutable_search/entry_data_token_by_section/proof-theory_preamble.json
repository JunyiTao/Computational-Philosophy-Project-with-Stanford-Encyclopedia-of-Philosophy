    "main_text": "\n\nProof theory is not an esoteric technical subject that was invented to\nsupport a formalist doctrine in the philosophy of mathematics; rather,\nit has been developed as an attempt to analyze aspects of mathematical\nexperience and to isolate, possibly overcome, methodological problems\nin the foundations of mathematics. The origins of those problems,\nforcefully and sometimes contentiously formulated in the 1920s, are\ntraceable to the transformation of mathematics in the nineteenth\ncentury: the emergence of abstract mathematics, its reliance on set\ntheoretic notions, and its focus on logic in a broad, foundational\nsense. Substantive issues came to the fore already in the mathematical\nwork and the foundational essays of Dedekind and Kronecker; they\nconcerned the legitimacy of undecidable concepts, the existence of\ninfinite mathematical objects, and the sense of non-constructive\nproofs of existential statements.\n\nIn an attempt to mediate between conflicting foundational positions,\nHilbert shifted issues, already around 1900, from a mathematical to a\nvaguely conceived metamathematical level. That approach was rigorously\nrealized in the 1920s, when he took advantage of the possibility of\nformalizing mathematics in deductive systems and investigated the\nunderlying formal frames from a strictly constructive,\n\u201cfinitist\u201d standpoint. Hilbert\u2019s approach raised\nfascinating metamathematical questions\u2014from semantic\ncompleteness through mechanical decidability to syntactic\nincompleteness; however, the hoped-for mathematical resolution of the\nfoundational issues was not achieved. The failure of his finitist\nconsistency program raised and deepened equally fascinating\nmethodological questions. A broadened array of problems with only\npartial solutions has created a vibrant subject that spans\ncomputational, mathematical, and philosophical issues\u2014with a\nrich history.\n\nThe main part of our article covers these exciting investigations for\nan expanded Hilbert Program through 1999\u2014with special, detailed\nattention to results and techniques that by now can be called\n\u201cclassical\u201d and are of continued interest. Newer, but\nstill closely connected developments are sketched in Appendices: the\nproof theory of set theories in Appendix D, combinatorial\nindependence results in Appendix E, and provably total\nfunctions in Appendix F. Here (infinitary) sequent calculi and\nsuitable systems of ordinal notations are crucial proof theoretic\ntools. However, we discuss in section 4.2 also G\u00f6del\u2019s\nDialectica Interpretation and some of its extensions as an alternative\nfor obtaining relative consistency proofs and describe in section\n5.2.1 the systematic attempt of completing the incomplete through\nrecursive progressions. Both topics are analyzed further in Appendix\nC.2 and Appendix B, respectively. To complete this bird\u2019s eye\nview of our article, we mention that the Epilogue, section 6,\nnot only indicates further proof theoretic topics, but also some\ndirections of current research that are connected to proof theory and\nof deep intrinsic interest. We have tried to convey the vibrancy of a\nsubject that thrives on concrete computational and (meta-)\nmathematical work, but also invites and is grounded in general\nphilosophical reflection.\n",
