The\nterm \u201cnothing\u201d has two meanings: it can mean\n\u201cnothing through privation\u201d (nihil per\nprivationem), or \u201cnothing on account of excellence\u201d\n(nihil per excellentiam). The lowest rung in the hierarchy of\nbeing, unformed matter, is \u201calmost nothing\u201d (prope\nnihil), or \u201cnothing through privation\u201d. In contrast,\nGod is non-being through the excellence of His nature which transcends\nall being. Since there is nothing outside God, \u201ccreation from\nnothing\u201d cannot mean creation from some principle outside God,\nrather it means: creation out of God\u2019s superabundant\nnothingness. God creates out of himself (a se) and all\ncreation remains within him.\n",
