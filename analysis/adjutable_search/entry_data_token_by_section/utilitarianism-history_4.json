    "main_text": "Henry Sidgwick\n3. Henry Sidgwick\n\n\nHenry Sidgwick's (1838\u20131900) The Methods of Ethics (1874) is\none of the most well known works in utilitarian moral philosophy, and\ndeservedly so. It offers a defense of utilitarianism, though some\nwriters (Schneewind 1977) have argued that it should not primarily be\nread as a defense of utilitarianism. In The Methods Sidgwick\nis concerned with developing an account of \u201c\u2026the\ndifferent methods of Ethics that I find implicit in our common moral\nreasoning\u2026\u201d These methods are egoism, intuition based\nmorality, and utilitarianism. On Sidgwick's view, utilitarianism is\nthe more basic theory. A simple reliance on intuition, for example,\ncannot resolve fundamental conflicts between values, or rules, such as\nTruth and Justice that may conflict. In Sidgwick's words\n\u201c\u2026we require some higher principle to decide the\nissue\u2026\u201d That will be utilitarianism.  Further, the rules\nwhich seem to be a fundamental part of common sense morality are often\nvague and underdescribed, and applying them will actually require\nappeal to something theoretically more basic \u2014 again,\nutilitarianism. Yet further, absolute interpretations of rules seem\nhighly counter-intuitive, and yet we need some justification for any\nexceptions \u2014 provided, again, by utilitarianism.  Sidgwick\nprovides a compelling case for the theoretical primacy of\nutilitarianism.\n\n\nSidgwick was also a British philosopher, and his views developed out\nof and in response to those of Bentham and Mill. His\nMethods offer an engagement with the theory as it had been\npresented before him, and was an exploration of it and the main\nalternatives as well as a defense.\n\n\nSidgwick was also concerned with clarifying fundamental features of\nthe theory, and in this respect his account has been enormously\ninfluential to later writers, not only to utilitarians and\nconsequentialists, generally, but to intuitionists as well.\nSidgwick's thorough and penetrating discussion of the theory\nraised many of the concerns that have been developed by recent moral\nphilosophers.\n\n\nOne extremely controversial feature of Sidgwick's views\nrelates to his rejection of a publicity requirement for moral\ntheory. He writes:\n\n\nThus, the Utilitarian conclusion, carefully stated, would seem to be\nthis; that the opinion that secrecy may render an action right which\nwould not otherwise be so should itself be kept comparatively secret;\nand similarly it seems expedient that the doctrine that esoteric\nmorality is expedient should itself be kept esoteric. Or, if this\nconcealment be difficult to maintain, it may be desirable that Common\nSense should repudiate the doctrines which it is expedient to confine\nto an enlightened few. And thus a Utilitarian may reasonably desire,\non Utilitarian principles, that some of his conclusions should be\nrejected by mankind generally; or even that the vulgar should keep\naloof from his system as a whole, in so far as the inevitable\nindefiniteness and complexity of its calculations render it likely to\nlead to bad results in their hands. (490)\n\n\nThis accepts that utilitarianism may be self-effacing; that is, that\nit may be best if people do not believe it, even though it is\ntrue. Further, it rendered the theory subject to Bernard\nWilliams' (1995) criticism that the theory really simply\nreflected the colonial elitism of Sidgwick's time, that it was\n\u2018Government House Utilitarianism.\u2019 The elitism in his\nremarks may reflect a broader attitude, one in which the educated are\nconsidered better policy makers than the uneducated.\n\n\nOne issue raised in the above remarks is relevant to practical\ndeliberation in general. To what extent should proponents of a\ngiven theory, or a given rule, or a given policy \u2014 or even\nproponents of a given one-off action \u2014 consider what they think\npeople will actually do, as opposed to what they think those\nsame people ought to do (under full and reasonable reflection,\nfor example)? This is an example of something that comes up in\nthe Actualism/possibilism debate in accounts of practical\ndeliberation. Extrapolating from the example used above, we have\npeople who advocate telling the truth, or what they believe to be the\ntruth, even if the effects are bad because the truth is somehow misused\nby others. On the other hand are those who recommend not telling\nthe truth when it is predicted that the truth will be misused by others\nto achieve bad results. Of course it is the case that the truth\nought not be misused, that its misuse can be avoided and is not\ninevitable, but the misuse is entirely predictable. Sidgwick\nseems to recommending that we follow the course that we predict will\nhave the best outcome, given as part of our calculations the data that\nothers may fail in some way \u2014 either due to having bad desires,\nor simply not being able to reason effectively. The worry\nWilliams points to really isn't a worry specifically with\nutilitarianism (Driver 2011). Sidgwick would point out\nthat if it is bad to hide the truth, because \u2018Government\nHouse\u2019 types, for example, typically engage in self-deceptive\nrationalizations of their policies (which seems entirely plausible),\nthen one shouldn't do it. And of course, that heavily\ninfluences our intuitions.\n\n\nSidgwick raised issues that run much deeper to our basic\nunderstanding of utilitarianism. For example, the way earlier\nutilitarians characterized the principle of utility left open serious\nindeterminacies. The major one rests on the distinction between\ntotal and average utility. He raised the issue in the context of\npopulation growth and increasing utility levels by increasing numbers\nof people (or sentient beings):\n\n\nAssuming, then, that the average happiness of human beings is a\npositive quantity, it seems clear that, supposing the average\nhappiness enjoyed remains undiminished, Utilitarianism directs us to\nmake the number enjoying it as great as possible. But if we foresee as\npossible that an increase in numbers will be accompanied by a decrease\nin average happiness or vice versa, a point arises which has\nnot only never been formally noticed, but which seems to have been\nsubstantially overlooked by many Utilitarians. For if we take\nUtilitarianism to prescribe, as the ultimate end of action, happiness\non the whole, and not any individual's happiness, unless\nconsidered as an element of the whole, it would follow that, if the\nadditional population enjoy on the whole positive happiness, we ought\nto weigh the amount of happiness gained by the extra number against\nthe amount lost by the remainder. (415)\n\n\nFor Sidgwick, the conclusion on this issue is not to simply strive\nto greater average utility, but to increase population to the point\nwhere we maximize the product of the number of persons who are\ncurrently alive and the amount of average happiness. So it seems\nto be a hybrid, total-average view. This discussion also raised\nthe issue of policy with respect to population growth, and both would\nbe pursued in more detail by later writers, most notably Derek Parfit\n(1986).\n",
