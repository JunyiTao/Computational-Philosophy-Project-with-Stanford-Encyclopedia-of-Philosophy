    "main_text": "Aspects of Illocutionary Force || Direction of Fit\n3.1 Direction of Fit\n\n\nConsider an example derived from Anscombe (1963): a woman sends her\nhusband to the grocery store with a list of things to procure;\nunbeknownst to him he is also being trailed by a detective concerned\nto make a list of what the man buys. By the time the husband and\ndetective are in the checkout line, their two lists contain exactly\nthe same items. The contents of the two lists differ, however, along\nanother dimension. For the contents of the husband\u2019s list guide what\nhe puts in his shopping cart. Insofar, his list exhibits\nworld-to-word direction of fit: It is, so to speak, the job\nof the items in his cart to conform to what is on his list. By\ncontrast, it is the job of the detective\u2019s list to conform with the\nworld, in particular to what is in the husband\u2019s cart. As such, the\ndetective\u2019s list has word-to-world direction of fit: The onus\nis on those words to conform to how things are. Speech acts such as\nassertions and predictions have word-to-world direction of fit, while\nspeech acts such as commands have world-to-word direction of fit.\n\n\nNot all speech acts appear to have direction of fit. I can thank you\nby saying \u201cThank you,\u201d and it is widely agreed that\nthanking is a speech act. However, thanking seems to have neither of\nthe directions of fit we have discussed thus far. Similarly, asking\nwho is at the door is a speech act, but it does not seem to have\neither of the directions of fit we have thus far mentioned. Some would\nrespond by construing questions as a form of imperative (e.g.,\n\u201cTell me who is at the door!\u201d), and then ascribing the\ndirection of fit characteristic of imperatives to questions. This\nleaves untouched, however, banal cases such as thanking or even,\n\u201cHooray for Arsenal!\u201d Some authors, such as Searle and\nVanderveken 1985, describe such cases as having \u201cnull\u201d\ndirection of fit. That characterization is evidently distinct from\nsaying such speech acts have no direction of fit at\nall.[9]\n\n\nDirection of fit is also not so fine-grained as to enable us to\ndistinguish speech acts meriting different treatment. Consider\nasserting that the center of the Milky Way is inhabited by a black\nhole, as opposed to conjecturing that the center of the Milky Way is\nso inhabited. These two acts are subject to different norms: The\nformer purports to be a manifestation of knowledge, while the latter\ndoes not. This is suggested by the fact that it is appropriate to\nreply to the assertion with, \u201cHow do you know?\u201d\n(Williamson 1996), while that is not an appropriate response to the\nconjecture (Green 2017). Nevertheless, both the assertion and\nconjecture have word-to-world direction of fit. Might there be other\nnotions enabling us to mark differences between speech acts with the\nsame direction of fit?\n",
