    "main_text": "\n\nThe predominant current-day meaning of genotype is some\nrelevant part of the DNA passed to the organism by its parents. The\nphenotype is the physical and behavioral traits of the\norganism, for example, size and shape, metabolic activities, and\npatterns of movement. The distinction between them is\nespecially important in evolutionary theory, where the survival and\nmating of organisms depends on their traits, but it is the DNA, held\nto be unaffected by the development of the traits over the life\ncourse, that is transmitted to the next generation. Philosophical\ndiscussion mostly now takes the predominant meanings as given,\nfocusing instead on questions about the genotype-phenotype\nrelationship. For example: How can DNA be construed as\ninformation for the processes of development of an organism\u2019s\ntraits? What is the causal status of DNA versus other influences in\nthe organism\u2019s development? (see entries on\n inheritance systems\n and\n biological information\n and also Griffiths & Stotz 2013). Without dismissing the\nimportance of such questions, the focus of this entry remains on the\ngenotype-phenotype distinction. Given that discussion by\nphilosophers of this issue has been minimal, this entry cannot take\nthe standard form of a review of published debates. In order to help\nframe and orient readers\u2019 conceptual inquiries, another approach\nis needed. The entry builds from the observations that the original\nmeanings of genotype and phenotype and the distinction between them as\ngiven by Wilhelm Johannsen (1911) were quite different from the now\npredominant meaning (given above) and that different kinds of meanings\ncoexist in Johannsen and up to the present. To make sense of those\nobservations, Johannsen\u2019s paper is recounted with special\nreference to practices or assumptions regarding control of\nbiological materials and conditions. Subsequent developments are then\ndescribed in relation to problems introduced by conceptualizing\nheredity on the basis of breeding experiments. This framing brings\ninto play many areas of philosophical discussions, including the\n\u201cNew Experimentalism\u201d in philosophy of biology (see entry\non\n experiment in biology),\n abstraction (see entry on\n abstract objects),\n confirmation, ambiguity, Scientific Realism, descriptive versus\nnormative approaches, and The Social Dimensions of Scientific\nKnowledge. At the same time, the framing helps open up questions that\nhave not been well addressed in those discussions and has implications\nfor issues that might seem settled to many who, when they invoke the\ngenotype-phenotype distinction, are simply thinking DNA\nversus trait. \n",
