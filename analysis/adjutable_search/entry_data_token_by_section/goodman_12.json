    "main_text": "The Old and the New Riddle of Induction and their Solution || The New Riddle of Induction\n5.3 The New Riddle of Induction\nBefore presenting Goodman\u2019s solution, we first have to discuss\nGoodman\u2019s own challenge, the so-called \u201cNew Riddle of\nInduction\u201d.\nConsider the following two (supposedly true) statements:\n\n(B1)\n This piece of copper conducts electricity.\n\n(B2)\n This man in the room is a third son.\n\n\nB1 is a confirmation instance of the following regularity\nstatement:\n\n(L1)\nAll pieces of copper conduct electricity.\n\n\nBut does B2 confirm anything like L2?\n\n(L2)\nAll men in this room are third sons.\n\n\nObviously, it does not. But what makes the difference? Both\nregularity statements (L1 and L2) are built according to the exact\nsame syntactical procedure from the evidence statements. Therefore, it\ndoes not seem to be for a syntactical reason that B1 confirms L1 but\nB2 fails to confirm L2. Rather, the reason is that statements like L1\nare lawlike, whereas statements like L2 at best express accidentally\ntrue generalizations. Lawlike statements, in contrast to accidentally\ntrue general statements, are confirmed by their instances and support\ncounterfactuals. L1 supports the counterfactual claim that if this\nthing I have in my hand were a piece of copper, it would conduct\nelectricity. In contrast, supposing that it is indeed true, L2 would\nnot support that if an arbitrary man were here in the room, he would\nbe a third son. To tell which statements are lawlike and which\nstatements are not is therefore of great importance in the philosophy\nof science.  A satisfactory account of induction (or corroboration -- \n see the discussion of Popper in the entry on \n the problem of induction) \nas well as explanation and prediction requires this distinction.  \nGoodman, however, shows that this is extremely hard to get.\nHere comes the riddle. Suppose that your research is in gemology.\nYour special interest lies in the color properties of certain\ngemstones, in particular, emeralds. All emeralds you have examined\nbefore a certain time \\(t\\) were green (your notebook is full of\nevidence statements of the form \u201cEmerald \\(x\\) found at\nplace \\(y\\) date \\(z (z \\le t)\\) is green\u201d). It seems that,\nat \\(t\\), this supports the hypothesis that all emeralds are\ngreen (L3).\nNow Goodman introduces the predicate \u201cgrue\u201d. This\npredicate applies to all things examined before some future\ntime \\(t\\) just in case they are green but to other things\n(observed at or after \\(t\\)) just in case they are blue:\n\n(DEF1)  \\(x\\) is\ngrue \\(=_{df}\\) \\(x\\) is examined before \\(t\\) and green \u2228\n\\(x\\) is not so examined and blue \n\nUntil \\(t\\) it is obviously the case that for each statement\nin your notebook, there is a parallel statement asserting that the\nemerald \\(x\\) found at place \\(y\\) date \\(z (z \\le t)\\) is\ngrue. Each of these statements is analytically equivalent with the\ncorresponding one in your notebook. All these grue-evidence statements\ntaken together confirm the hypothesis that all emeralds are grue (L4),\nand they confirm this hypothesis to the exact same degree as the\ngreen-evidence statements confirmed the hypothesis that all emeralds\nare green. But if that is the case, then the following two predictions\nare also confirmed to the same degree:\n\n(P1)\nThe next emerald first examined after \\(t\\) will be green.\n\n(P2)\nThe next emerald first examined after \\(t\\) will be grue.\n\n\nHowever, to be a grue emerald examined after \\(t\\) is not to\nbe a green emerald. An emerald first examined after \\(t\\) is grue\niff it is blue. We have two mutually incompatible predictions, both\nconfirmed to the same degree by the past evidence. We could obviously\ndefine infinitely many grue-like predicates that would all lead to\nnew, similarly incompatible predictions.\nThe immediate lesson is that we cannot use all kinds of weird\npredicates to formulate hypotheses or to classify our evidence. Some\npredicates (which are the ones like \u201cgreen\u201d) can be used\nfor this; other predicates (the ones like \u201cgrue\u201d) must be\nexcluded, if induction is supposed to make any sense. This already is\nan interesting result. For valid inductive inferences the choice of\npredicates matters. \nIt is not just that we lack justification for accepting a general\nhypothesis as true only on the basis of positive instances and lack of\ncounterinstances (which was the old problem), or to define what rule\nwe are using when accepting a general hypothesis as true on these\ngrounds (which was the problem after Hume). The problem is to explain\nwhy some general statements (such as L3) are confirmed by their\ninstances, whereas others (such as L4) are not. Again, this is a\nmatter of the lawlikeness of L3 in contrast to L4, but how are we\nsupposed to tell the lawlike regularities from the illegitimate\ngeneralizations?\nAn immediate reply is that the illegitimate generalization L4\ninvolves a temporal restriction, just as L2 was restricted spatially\n(see e.g., Carnap 1947). The idea would be that predicates that cannot\nbe used for induction are analytically \u201cpositional\u201d, i.e.,\ntheir definitions refer to individual constants (for places or times).\nA projectible predicate, i.e., a predicate that can be used for\ninduction, has no definition which would refer to such individual\nconstants but is purely qualitative (e.g., because it is a basic\npredicate). The trouble is that this reply makes it relative to a\nlanguage whether or not a predicate is projectible. If we begin with a\nlanguage containing the basic predicates \u201cgreen\u201d and\n\u201cblue\u201d (as in English), \u201cgrue\u201d and\n\u201cbleen\u201d are positional. \u201cBleen\u201d is defined as\nfollows:\n\n(DEF2)\n \\(x\\) is bleen \\(=_{df}\\) \\(x\\) is\n    examined before \\(t\\) and blue \u2228 \\(x\\) is not so\n    examined and green\n\n\nBut if we start with a language that has \u201cbleen\u201d and\n\u201cgrue\u201d as basic predicates, \u201cgreen\u201d and\n\u201cblue\u201d are positional:\n\n(DEF3)\n\\(x\\) is green \\(=_{df}\\) \\(x\\) is\n    examined before \\(t\\) and grue \u2228 \\(x\\) is not so\n    examined and bleen\n\n(DEF4)\n\\(x\\) is blue \\(=_{df}\\) \\(x\\) is\n    examined before \\(t\\) and bleen \u2228 \\(x\\) is not so\n    examined and grue\n\n\n\n\nBoth languages are symmetrical in all their semantic and\nsyntactical properties. So the positionality of predicates is not\ninvariant with respect to linguistically equivalent\ntransformations. But if this is the case, there is no semantic or\nsyntactic criterion on whose basis we could draw the line between\nprojectible predicates and predicates that we cannot use for\ninduction.\n",
