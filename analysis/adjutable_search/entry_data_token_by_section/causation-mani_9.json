    "main_text": "(Alleged) Causes That Are Unmanipulable for Logical, Conceptual, or Metaphysical Reasons\n12. (Alleged) Causes That Are Unmanipulable for Logical, Conceptual, or Metaphysical Reasons\n\nSeveral statisticians (e.g., Holland 1986; Rubin 1986), as well as\nsimilarly minded epidemiologists (e.g., Hernan and Taubman 2008) who\nadvocate treatments of causation in terms of manipulation-based ideas\n(in this case in terms of \u201cpotential outcome\u201d theory) have\nheld that causal claims involving causes that are unmanipulable in\nprinciple are defective or lack a clear meaning\u2014they think of\nthis conclusion as following directly from a manipulationist approach\nto causation. What is meant by an unmanipulable cause is not made very\nclear, but what these authors have in mind are not candidate causes\nthat cannot be manipulated as a practical matter, but rather\ncandidates that are such that we lack any clear conception of what\nwould be involved in manipulating them or any basis for assessing what\nwould happen under such manipulations\u2014cases in which\nmanipulation seems \u201cimpossible\u201d for conceptual or (if you\nlike) \u201cmetaphysical\u201d reasons. Proposed examples include\nsuch candidate causes as race, membership in a particular species, and\ngender. Other examples discussed in this connection involve cases in\nwhich there are many different things one might have in mind by\n\u201cmanipulation\u201d of the candidate causes with different\nresults flowing from alternative understandings of\n\u201cmanipulation\u201d so that the claims in question are taken,\nfrom a manipulationist or interventionist standpoint, to be unclear or\nambiguous. All such cases contrast with the case involving\n (G)\n above, where the notion of manipulating the moon\u2019s orbit seems\nperfectly clear and well-defined, and the problem is simply that the\nworld happens to be arranged in such a way that an intervention that\nproduces such a change is not physically possible.\n\nA sympathetic reconstruction of the position under discussion might go\nas follows. On an interventionist account of causation, causes\n(whether we think of them as events, types of events, properties,\nfacts, or what have you) must be representable by means of\nvariables\u2014where this means, at a minimum, that it must\nbe possible for the cause to change or to assume different values, for\nwhatever object, unit or system those values are assigned to, as when\nit is possible for the same particle to be either at position \\(p_1\\)\nspecified by a position variable \\(P\\) or at some alternative position\n\\(p_2\\). This is required if we are to have a well-defined notion of\nmanipulating a candidate cause and well-defined answers to\ncounterfactual queries about what would happen if the cause were to be\nmanipulated in some way\u2014matters which are central to what causal\nclaims mean on any version of a manipulability theory worthy of the\nname. However, for some putative causes, there may be no well-defined\nnotion of change or variation in value and if so, a manipulability\ntheory will not count these as genuine causes. Suppose, for example,\nwe lack any coherent conception of what it is for something to exist\nbut to be non-physical. Then there will be no well-defined notion of\nintervening to change whether something is or is not a physical object\nand being a physical object will not be a factor or property that can\nserve as a cause. (Of course it is consistent with this that there are\ntrue and perhaps even lawful generalizations about all physical\nobjects.) For example, although to the best of our knowledge, it is a\nlaw of nature that\n\n(L) no physical object\ncan be accelerated from a velocity less than that of light to a\nvelocity greater than light,\n\n\n(L) is not, according to this version of a manipulability theory, a\ncausal generalization: being a physical object is not a cause\nof the incapacity in question.\n\nMoreover, even with respect to variables that can take more than one\nvalue, the notion of an intervention or manipulation will not be\nwell-defined if there is no well-defined notion of changing\nthe values of that variable. Suppose that we introduce a variable\n\u201canimal\u201d which takes the values \\(\\{\\)lizard, kitten,\nraven\\(\\}\\). By construction, this variable has more than one value,\nbut if, as seems plausible, we have no coherent idea of what it is to\nchange a raven into lizard or kitten, there will be no well-defined\nnotion of an intervention for this variable and being an animal (or\nbeing a raven) will not be the sort of thing that can count as a\nbona fide cause on a manipulability theory. The notion of\nchanging the value of a variable seems to involve the idea of an\nalteration from one value of the variable to another in circumstances\nin which the very same system or entity can possess both values and\nthis notion seems inapplicable to the case under discussion.\n\nNote that, just as with some of the examples considered in\n \u00a712,\n this conclusion does not seem to follow on the pure setting\ninterpretation of the interventionist account. One can, after all, set\nup an equation \\(Y = X\\) with a candidate variable \\(X\\), taking the\nvalues 0 and 1, according to whether some object is a kitten or lizard\nand a candidate effect variable \\(Y\\), taking the values 0 and 1\naccording to whether that object is warm-blooded or cold-blooded. Then\nsetting \\(X\\) to 0 rather than 1 changes whether \\(Y= 0\\) or 1, and if\nthis is sufficient for causation, being a kitten rather than a lizard\ncauses warmbloodiness rather than coldbloodiness. If one thinks, that\nthere is something defective or problematic about these causal claims,\nthis requires, within an interventionist framework, a richer\nconception of what is required for causation than what is suggested by\nthe setting conception of intervention. A similar point applies to the\nother examples described in this section.\n\nSome readers will take it to be intuitively obvious that, e.g., being\na raven can be a cause of some particular organism\u2019s being\nblack, that being a kitten can be a cause of warm-bloodiness and so\non. If causal claims like\n\n(R) \u201cRaveness\ncauses blackness\u201d \n\n\nare true, it will be an important advantage of a setting version of\ninterventionism over a formulation in terms of a possibility\nconstrained notion of intervention that the former but not the latter\nis able to capture claims like (R). By contrast, others will think\nthat claims like (R) are, if not false, at least unclear and\nunperspicuous, and that it is a point in favor of a possibility\nconstrained version of the interventionist account that it can capture\nthis. Those who take this second view will think that claims like (R)\nshould be replaced by claims that involve causes that are\nstraightforwardly manipulable. For example, (R) might be replaced by a\nclaim that identified the genetic factors and biochemical pathways\nthat are responsible for raven pigmentation\u2014factors and pathways\nfor which there is a well-defined notion of manipulation and which are\nsuch that if they were appropriately manipulated, this would lead to\nchanges in pigmentation. Theorists like Rubin and Holland will think\nthat such a replacement would be clearer and more perspicuous than the\noriginal claim (R). Another illustration of this general idea that\nreplacing claims involving non-manipulable candidate causes with\nclaims involving candidate manipulable causes clarifies their meaning\nis discussed in\n The Role of the Manipulability Theory in Clarifying Causal Claims.\n",
