While the\nexpression \u201clegal probabilism\u201d seems to have been coined\nby Haack (2014b), the underlying idea can be traced back to the early\ndays of probability theory (see, for example, Bernoulli 1713). Another\nterm that is sometimes encountered in the literature is \u201ctrial\nby mathematics\u201d coined by Tribe (1971). Legal probabilism\nremains a minority view among legal scholars, but attained greater\npopularity in the second half of the twentieth century in conjunction\nwith the law and economics movement (Becker 1968; Calabresi 1961;\nPosner 1973).\n\nTo illustrate the range of applications of legal probabilism, consider\na stylized case. Alice is charged with murder. Traces at the crime\nscene, which the perpetrator probably left, genetically match\nAlice. An eyewitness testifies that Alice ran away from the scene\nafter the crime was committed. Another witness asserts that Alice had\npreviously threatened the victim multiple times. Alice, however, has\nan alibi. Mark claims he was with her for the entire day. This case\nraises several questions. How should the evidence be evaluated? How to\ncombine conflicting pieces of evidence, such as the incriminating DNA\nmatch and the alibi testimony? If the standard of decision in a murder\ncase is proof beyond a reasonable doubt, how strong should the\nevidence be to meet this standard?\n\nLegal probabilism is a theoretical framework\nthat helps to address these different questions. Finkelstein and\nFairley (1970) gave one of the first systematic analyses of how\nprobability theory, and Bayes\u2019 theorem in particular, can help\nto evaluate evidence at trial (see\n Section 1).\n After the discovery of DNA fingerprinting, many legal probabilists\nfocused on how probability theory could be used to quantify the\nstrength of a DNA match (see\n Section 2).\n Recent work in Artificial Intelligence made it possible to use\nprobability theory\u2014in the form of Bayesian networks\u2014to\nevaluate complex bodies of evidence consisting of multiple components\n(see\n Section 3).\n Following the work of Lempert (1977), likelihood ratios are now\ncommonly used as probabilistic measures of the relevance of the\nevidence presented at trial (see\n Section 4).\n Other authors, starting with seminal papers by Kaplan (1968) and Cullison (1969),\ndeployed probability theory and decision theory to model decision-making and standards of\nproof at trial (see\n Section 5).\n\nLegal probabilism is no doubt controversial. Many legal theorists and\nphilosophers, starting with Tribe (1971), leveled several critiques\nagainst it. These critiques range from difficulties in assessing the\nprobability of someone\u2019s criminal or civil liability to the\ndehumanization of trial decisions to misconstruing how the process of evidence evaluation and decision-making takes place in trial proceedings.\n\nA key challenge for legal probabilism\u2014one that has\ngalvanized philosophical attention in recent years\u2014comes from\nthe paradoxes of legal proof or puzzles of naked statistical evidence. Nesson (1979), Cohen (1977) and Thomson\n(1986) formulated scenarios in which, despite a high probability of\nguilt or civil liability based on the available evidence, a verdict\nagainst the defendant seems unwarranted (see\n Section 6).\n Other challenges for legal probabilism include the problem of\nconjunction and the reference class problem (see\n Section 7).\n\nLegal probabilism can also be understood as a far reaching research\nprogram that aims to analyze\u2014by means of probability\ntheory\u2014the trial system as a whole, including institutions such\nas the jury system and trial procedure. Some early French probability\ntheorists examined the relationship between jury size, jury voting\nrules and the risk of convicting an innocent (Condorcet 1785; Laplace\n1814; Poisson 1837; for more recent discussions, see Kaye 1980;\nNitzan 2009; Suzuki 2015).\n\nAt the root of this more radical version of legal probabilism lies the\ndream of discerning patterns in the behavior of individuals and\nimproving legal institutions (Hacking 1990). Today\u2019s rapid grow\nof data\u2014paired with machine learning and the pervasiveness of\ncost-benefit analysis\u2014has rendered this dream more alive than\never before (Ferguson 2020). For a critique of mathematization,\nquantification and cost-benefit analysis applied to the justice\nsystem, see Allen (2013) and Harcourt (2018). This entry will not, however, discuss\nthis far reaching version of legal probabilism.\n", "toc": [{"#ProbTool": "1.

Probabilistic Toolkit\n\nThis section begins with a review of the axioms of probability and its\ninterpretations, and then shows how probability theory helps to spot\nmistakes that people may fall prey to when they assess evidence at\ntrial, such as the prosecutor\u2019s fallacy, the base rate fallacy,\nand the defense attorney\u2019s fallacy. This section also examines\nhow probabilities are assigned to hypotheses and how hypotheses are\nformulated at different levels of granularity.\n1.1 Probability and its interpretation\n\nStandard probability theory consists of three axioms:\n\n\nTable 1\n\n\nAxiom\nIn words\nIn symbols  \n\n\nNon-negativity\nThe probability of any proposition \\(A\\)\nis greater than or equal to 0.\n\\(\\Pr(A)\\geq 0\\) \n\nNormality\nThe probability of any logical tautology\nis 1.\nIf \\(\\models A\\), then \\(\\Pr(A)=1\\) \n\nAdditivity\n The probability of the disjunction of\ntwo propositions \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is the sum of their respective\nprobabilities, provided the two propositions are logically\nincompatible.\nIf \\(\\models \\neg (A \\wedge B)\\), then \\(\\Pr(A\\vee\nB)=\\Pr(A)+\\Pr(B)\\)  \n\n\n\nAn important notion in probability theory is that of conditional\nprobability, that is, the probability of a proposition \\(A\\)\nconditional on a proposition \\(B\\), in symbols, \\(\\Pr( A\\pmid B)\\).\nAlthough it is sometimes taken as a primitive notion, conditional\nprobability is usually defined as the probability of the conjunction\n\\(\\Pr(A \\wedge B)\\) divided by the probability of the proposition\nbeing conditioned on, \\(\\Pr(B)\\), or in other words,  \n\n\\[\\Pr(A \\pmid B)= \\frac{\\Pr(A \\wedge B)}{\\Pr(B)}\\quad \\text{ assuming \\(\\Pr(B)\\neq 0\\).}\\]\n\n\nThis notion is crucial in legal applications. The fact-finders at\ntrial might want to know the probability of \u201cThe defendant was\nat the scene when the crime was committed\u201d conditional on\n\u201cMrs. Dale asserts she saw the defendant run away from the\nscene\u201d. Or they might want to know the probability of \u201cThe\ndefendant is the source of the traces found at the crime scene\u201d\nconditional on \u201cThe DNA expert asserts that the\ndefendant\u2019s DNA matches the traces at the scene.\u201d In\ngeneral, the fact-finders are interested in the probability of a given\nhypothesis \\(H\\) about what happened conditional on the available\nevidence \\(E\\), in symbols, \\(\\Pr(H \\pmid E)\\).\n\nMost legal probabilists agree that the probabilities ascribed to\nstatements that are disputed in a trial\u2014such as \u201cThe\ndefendant is the source of the crime traces\u201d or \u201cThe\ndefendant was at the crime scene when the crime was\ncommitted\u201d\u2014should be understood as evidence-based degrees\nof belief (see, for example, Cullison 1969; Kaye 1979b; Nance\n 2016). This interpretation addresses the worry that since past events did or\ndid not happen, their probabilities should be 1 or 0. Even if the\nobjective chances are 1 or 0, statements about past events could still\nbe assigned different degrees of belief given the evidence available.\nIn addition, degrees of belief are better suited than frequencies for\napplications to unrepeatable events, such as actions of individuals,\nwhich are often the focus of trial disputes Further engagement with these issues lies beyond the scope of this\nentry (for a more extensive discussion, see the entry on the\n interpretations of probability as well as Childers 2013; Gillies 2000; Mellor 2004; Skyrms 1966).\n\nSome worry that, except for obeying the axioms of probability, degrees\nof belief are in the end assigned in a subjective and arbitrary manner\n(Allen and Pardo 2019). This worry can be alleviated by noting that\ndegrees of belief should reflect a conscientious assessment of the\nevidence available which may also include empirical frequencies (see\n \u00a71.2\n below and the examples in ENFSI 2015). In some cases, however, the\nrelevant empirical frequencies will not be available. When this\nhappens, degrees of belief can still be assessed by relying on common\nsense and experience. Sometimes there will be no need to assign exact\nprobabilities to every statement about the past. In such cases, the relevant probabilities can be expressed approximately with sets of\nprobability measures (Shafer 1976; Walley 1991), probability\ndistributions over parameter values, or intervals (see later in\n \u00a71.4).\n1.2 Probabilistic fallacies\n\nSetting aside the practical difficulties of assigning probabilities to\ndifferent statements, probability theory is a valuable analytical tool in\ndetecting misinterpretations of the evidence and reasoning fallacies\nthat may otherwise go unnoticed.\n1.2.1 Assuming independence\n\nA common error that probability theory helps to identify consists in\nassuming without justification that two events are independent of one\nanother. A theorem of probability theory states that the probability\nof the conjunction of two events, \\(A\\wedge B\\), equals the product of\nthe probabilities of the conjuncts, \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), that is, \n\n\\[\\Pr(A \\wedge B)  = \\Pr(A)\\times \\Pr(B),\\] \n\n\nprovided \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are independent of one another in the sense\nthat the conditional probability \\(\\Pr(A \\pmid B)\\) is the same as the\nunconditional probability \\(\\Pr(A)\\). More formally, note that \n\n\\[\\Pr(A \\pmid B)=\\frac{\\Pr(A \\wedge B)}{\\Pr(B)},\\]\n\n\nso \n\n \\[\\Pr(A \\wedge B)=\\Pr(A)\\times \\Pr(B)\\]\n\n\nprovided \\(\\Pr(A)=\\Pr(A \\pmid B)\\). The latter equality means that learning about \\(B\\) does not change one's degree of belief about \n\\(A\\).\n\nThe trial of Janet and Malcolm Collins, a couple accused of robbery in\n1964 Los Angeles, illustrates how the lack of independence between\nevents can be overlooked. The couple was identified based on features\nat the time considered unusual. The prosecutor called an expert\nwitness, a college mathematician, to the stand, and asked him to\nconsider the following features and assume they had the following\nprobabilities: black man with a beard (1 in 10), man with a mustache\n(1 in 4), white woman with blond hair (1 out of 3), woman with a\nponytail (1 out of 10), interracial couple in a car (1 out of 1000),\ncouple driving a yellow convertible (1 out of 10). The mathematician,\ncorrectly, calculated the probability of a random couple displaying\nall these features on the assumption of independence: 1 in 12 million\n(assuming the individual probability estimates were correct). Relying\non this argument, the jury convicted the couple. If those features are\nso rare in Los Angeles and the robbers had them\u2014the jury must\nhave reasoned\u2014the Collins must be the robbers.\n\nThe conviction was later reversed by the Supreme Court of California\nin People v. Collins (68 Cal.2d 319,\n1968). The Court pointed out the mistake of assuming that\nmultiplying the probabilities of each feature would give the\nprobability of their joint occurrence. This assumption holds only if\nthe features in question are probabilistically independent. But this\nis not the case since the occurrence of, say, the feature \u201cman\nwith a beard\u201d might very well correlate with the feature\n\u201cman with a mustache\u201d. The same correlation might hold for\nthe features \u201cwhite woman with blond hair\u201d and\n\u201cwoman with a ponytail\u201d. Besides the lack of independence,\nanother problem is the fact that the probabilities associated with\neach feature were not obtained by any reliable method.\n\nThe British case R. v. Clark (EWCA Crim 54,\n2000) is another example of how the lack of independence\nbetween events can be easily overlooked. Sally Clark had two sons. Her\nfirst son died in 1996 and her second son died in similar\ncircumstances a few years later in 1998. They both died within a few\nweeks after birth. Could it just be a coincidence? At trial, the\npaediatrician Roy Meadow testified that the probability that a child\nfrom an affluent family such as the Clark\u2019s would die of Sudden\nInfant Death Syndrome (SIDS) was 1 in 8,543. Assuming that the two\ndeaths were independent events, Meadow calculated that the probability\nof both children dying of SIDS was \n\n\\[\\frac{1}{8,543}\\times \\frac{1}{8,543}, \\quad \\text{which approximately equals} \\quad \\frac{1}{73\\times 10^6}\\]\n\n\nor 1 in 73 million. This impressively low number no doubt played a\nrole in the outcome of the case. Sally Clark was convicted of\nmurdering her two infant sons (though the conviction was ultimately\nreversed on appeal). The \\(\\slashfrac{1}{(73\\times 10^6)}\\) figure\nrests on the assumption of independence. This assumption is seemingly\nfalse since environmental or genetic factors may predispose a family\nto SIDS (for a fuller discussion of this point, see Dawid 2002; Barker\n2017; Sesardic 2007).\n1.2.2 The prosecutor\u2019s fallacy\n\nAnother mistake that people often make while assessing the evidence\npresented at trial consists in conflating the two directions of\nconditional probability, \\(\\Pr(A\\pmid B)\\) and \\(\\Pr(B \\pmid A)\\). For\ninstance, if you toss a die, the probability that the result is 2\ngiven that it is even (which equals \\(\\slashfrac{1}{3}\\)) is different\nfrom the probability that the result is even given that it is 2 (which\nequals 1).\n\nIn criminal cases, confusion about the two directions of conditional\nprobability can lead to exaggerating the probability of the\nprosecutor\u2019s hypothesis. Suppose an expert testifies that the\nblood found at the crime scene matches the defendant\u2019s and it is\n5% probable that a person unrelated to the crime\u2014someone who is\nnot the source of the blood found at the scene\u2014would\nmatch by coincidence. Some may be tempted to interpret this statement\nas saying that the probability that the defendant is not the source of\nthe blood is 5% and thus it is 95% probable that the defendant is the\nsource. This flawed interpretation is known as the\nprosecutor\u2019s fallacy, sometimes also called the transposition fallacy (Thompson and Schumann 1987).\nThe 5% figure is the conditional probability \\(\\Pr(\\match \\pmid \\neg\n\\source)\\) that, assuming the defendant is not the source of\nthe crime scene blood \\((\\neg \\source),\\) he would\nstill match \\((\\match).\\) The 5% figure is not the\nprobability \\(\\Pr(\\neg \\source \\pmid \\match)\\) that, if the defendant\nmatches (\\(\\match\\)), he is not the source (\\(\\neg \\source\\)). By\nconflating the two directions and thinking that\n \n\n\\[\\Pr(\\neg \\source \\pmid \\match)=\\Pr(\\match \\pmid \\neg \\source)=5\\%,\\]\n\n\none is led to erroneously conclude that \\(\\Pr(\\source \\pmid\n\\match)=95\\%\\).\n\nThe same conflation occurred in the Collins case discussed earlier.\nEven if the calculations were correct, the 1 in 12 million probability\nthat a random couple would have the specified characteristics should\nbe interpreted as \\(\\Pr(\\match\\pmid \\textsf{innocent})\\), not as the\nprobability that the Collins were innocent given that they matched the\neyewitness description, \\(\\Pr(\\textsf{innocent}\\pmid \\match)\\).\nPresumably, the jurors convicted the Collins because they thought it\nwas virtually impossible that they were not the robbers. But the 1 in 12\nmillion figure, assuming it is correct, only shows that\n\\(\\Pr(\\match\\pmid \\textsf{innocent})\\) equals\n\\(\\slashfrac{1}{(12\\times 10^6)}\\), not that\n\\(\\Pr(\\textsf{innocent}\\pmid \\match)\\) equals\n\\(\\slashfrac{1}{(12\\times 10^6)}\\).\n1.2.3 Bayes\u2019 theorem and the base rate fallacy\n\nThe relation between the probability of the hypothesis given the\nevidence, \\(\\Pr(H \\pmid E)\\), and the probability of the evidence\ngiven the hypothesis, \\(\\Pr(E \\pmid H)\\), is captured by Bayes\u2019\ntheorem:  \n\n\\[\n\\Pr(H \\pmid E)  =  \\frac{\\Pr(E \\pmid H)}{\\Pr(E)} \\times \\Pr(H),\\quad\\text{  assuming } \\Pr(E) \\neq 0.\\] \n\n\nThe probability \\(\\Pr(H)\\) is called the prior probability of\n\\(H\\) (it is prior to taking evidence \\(E\\) into account) and\n\\(\\Pr(H\\pmid E)\\) is the posterior probability of \\(H\\). This\nterminology is standard, but is slightly misleading because it\nsuggests a temporal ordering which does not have to be there. Next,\nconsider the ratio \n\n\\[\\frac{\\Pr(E \\pmid H)}{\\Pr(E)},\\]\n\n\nsometimes called the Bayes\n factor.[1]\n This is the ratio between the probability \\(\\Pr(E \\pmid H)\\) of\nobserving evidence \\(E\\) assuming \\(H\\) (often called\nthe likelihood) and the probability \\(\\Pr(E)\\) of observing \\(E\\). By the law of total probability,\n\\(\\Pr(E)\\) results from adding the probability of observing \\(E\\)\nassuming \\(H\\) and the probability of observing \\(E\\) assuming \\(\\neg\nH\\), each weighted by the prior probabilities of \\(H\\) and \\(\\neg H\\)\nrespectively: \n\n \\[\\Pr(E)= \\Pr(E \\pmid H)\\times \\Pr(H)+\\Pr(E \\pmid \\neg H)\\times \\Pr(\\neg H).\\]\n\n\nAs is apparent from Bayes\u2019 theorem, multiplying the prior\nprobability by the Bayes factor yields the posterior probability \\(\\Pr(H \\pmid E)\\). Other things being equal, the lower the prior probability \\(\\Pr(H)\\), the lower the\nposterior probability \\(\\Pr(H \\pmid E)\\). The base rate\nfallacy consists in ignoring the effect of the prior probability\non the posterior (Kahneman and Tversky 1973). This leads to thinking\nthat the posterior probability of a hypothesis given the evidence is\ndifferent than it actually is (Koehler 1996).\n\nConsider the blood evidence example discussed previously. By\nBayes\u2019 theorem, the two conditional probabilities \\(\\Pr(\\neg\n\\source \\pmid \\match)\\) and \\(\\Pr(\\match \\pmid \\neg \\source)\\) are\nrelated as follows:\n \n\n\\[\n \\Pr(\\neg \\source \\pmid \\match)  = \\\\ \\frac{\\Pr(\\match \\pmid \\neg \\source)\\times \\Pr(\\neg \\source)}\n{\\Pr(\\match \\pmid \\neg \\source)\\times \\Pr(\\neg \\source)\n+ \\Pr(\\match \\pmid \\source)\\times \\Pr(\\source)}.\n\\]\n\n\n\nAbsent any other compelling evidence to the contrary, it should\ninitially be very likely that the defendant, as anyone else, had\nlittle to do with the crime. Say, for illustrative purposes, that the\nprior probability \\(\\Pr(\\neg \\source)= .99\\) and so\n\\(\\Pr(\\source)=.01\\) (more on how to assess prior probabilities later\nin\n \u00a71.4).\n Next, \\(\\Pr(\\match \\pmid \\source)\\) can be set approximately to\n\\(1\\), because if the defendant were the source of the blood at the\ncrime scene, he should match the blood at the scene (setting aside the\npossibility of false negatives). The expert estimated the probability\nthat someone who is not the source would coincidentally match the\nblood found at the scene\u2014that is, \\(\\Pr(\\match \\pmid \\neg\n\\source)\\)\u2014as equal to .05. By Bayes\u2019 theorem, \n\n\\[\n\\Pr(\\neg \\source \\pmid \\match)  = \\frac{.05}{(.05 \\times .99)+ (1 \\times .01)} \\times .99 \\approx .83.\\]\n\n\nThe posterior probability that the defendant is the source,\n\\(\\Pr(\\source\\pmid \\match)\\) is roughly \\(1-.83=.17\\), much lower than\nthe exaggerated value of .95. This posterior probability would have\ndropped even lower if the prior probability were lower. A similar\nanalysis applies to the Collins case. If the prior probability of the\nCollins\u2019s guilt is sufficiently low\u2014say in 1 in 6\nmillion\u2014the posterior guilt probability given the match with the\neyewitness description would be roughly .7, much less impressive\nthan \n\n\\[\\left(1-\\frac{1}{12\\times 10^6}\\right)\\approx .9999999.\\]\n\n1.2.4 Defense attorney\u2019s fallacy\n\nAlthough base rate information should not be overlooked, paying\nexcessive attention to it and ignoring other evidence leads to the\nso-called defense attorney\u2019s fallacy. As before,\nsuppose the prosecutor expert testifies that the defendant matches the\ntraces found at the crime scene and there is a 5% probability that a\nrandom person, unrelated to the crime, would coincidentally match, so\n\\(\\Pr(\\match\\pmid \\neg\\source)=.05\\). To claim that it is 95% likely\nthat the defendant is the source of the traces, or in symbols,\n\\(\\Pr(\\source\\pmid \\textsf{ match})=.95\\), would be to commit the\nprosecutor\u2019s fallacy described earlier. But suppose the defense\nargues that, since the population in town is 10,000 people, \\(5\\%\\) of\nthem would match by coincidence, that is, \\(10,000\\times 5\\%=500\\)\npeople. Since the defendant could have left the traces as any of the\nother 499 people, he is \\(\\slashfrac{1}{500}=.2\\%\\) likely to be the\nsource, a rather unimpressive figure. The match\u2014the defense\nconcludes\u2014is worthless evidence.\n\nThis analysis portrays the prosecutor\u2019s case as weaker than it\nneed be. If the investigators narrowed down the set of suspects to,\nsay, 100 people\u2014a potential piece of information the defense\nignored\u2014the match would make the defendant 16% likely to be the\nsource. This fact can be verified using Bayes\u2019 theorem (left as\nan exercise for the reader). Even assuming, as the defense claims,\nthat the pool of suspects comprises as many as 10,000 people, the\nprior probability that the defendant is the source would be\n\\(\\slashfrac{1}{10,000}\\), and since the defendant matches the traces,\nthis probability should rise to (approximately)\n\\(\\slashfrac{1}{500}\\). Given the upward shift in the probability from\n\\(\\slashfrac{1}{10,000}\\) to \\(\\slashfrac{1}{500}\\), the match should\nnot be considered worthless evidence (more on this later in\n \u00a72.1).\n1.3 Odds version of Bayes\u2019 theorem\n\nThe version of Bayes\u2019 theorem considered so far is\ninformationally demanding since the law of total\nprobability\u2014which spells out \\(\\Pr(E)\\), the denominator in the\nBayes factor \\(\\slashfrac{\\Pr(E \\pmid H)}{\\Pr(E)}\\)\u2014requires\none to consider \\(H\\) and the catch-all alternative hypothesis \\(\\neg\nH\\), comprising all possible alternatives to \\(H\\). A simpler version\nof Bayes\u2019 theorem is the so-called odds formulation:\n\n \\[\n\\frac{\\Pr(H \\pmid E)} {\\Pr(H' \\pmid E)} = \\frac{\\Pr(E \\pmid H)}{\\Pr(E \\pmid H')} \\times \\frac{\\Pr(H)} {\\Pr(H')},\\]\n\n\nor in words: \n\n \\[\\textit{posterior odds} = \\textit{likelihood ratio} \\times \\textit{prior odds}.\\]\n\n\nThe ratio  \n\n\\[\\frac{\\Pr(H)}{\\Pr(H')}\\]\n\n\nrepresents the prior odds, where \\(H\\) and \\(H'\\) are two\ncompeting hypotheses, not necessarily one the complement of the other.\nThe likelihood ratio \n\n\\[\\frac{\\Pr(E \\pmid H)}{\\Pr(E \\pmid H')}\\]\n\n\ncompares the probability of the same item of evidence \\(E\\) given the\ntwo hypotheses. The posterior odds  \n\n\\[\\frac{\\Pr(H \\pmid E)}{\\Pr(H' \\pmid E)}\\]\n\n\ncompares the probabilities of the hypotheses given the evidence. This\nratio is different from the probability \\(\\Pr(H \\pmid E)\\) of a\nspecific hypothesis given the evidence.\n\nAs an illustration, consider the Sally Clark case (previously\ndiscussed in\n \u00a71.2).\n The two hypotheses to compare are that Sally Clark\u2019s sons died\nof natural causes (natural) and that\nClark killed them (kill). The evidence\navailable is that the two sons died in similar circumstances one after\nthe other (two deaths). By\nBayes\u2019 theorem (in the odds version),  \n\n\\[\\frac{\\Pr(\\textsf{kill} \\pmid \\textsf{two deaths})}{\\Pr(\\textsf{natural} \\pmid \\textsf{two deaths})} = \n \\frac{\\Pr(\\textsf{two deaths} \\pmid \\textsf{kill})}{\\Pr(\\textsf{two deaths} \\pmid \\textsf{natural})} \n \\times \n \\frac{\\Pr(\\textsf{kill})}{\\Pr(\\textsf{natural})}.\\] \n\n\nThe likelihood ratio \n\n\\[\\frac{\\Pr(\\textsf{two deaths} \\pmid \\textsf{kill})}{\\Pr(\\textsf{two deaths} \\pmid \\textsf{natural})}\\]\n\n\ncompares the likelihood of the evidence (two\ndeaths) under each hypothesis (kill\nv. natural).\nSince under either hypothesis both\nbabies would have died\u2014by natural causes or killing\u2014the\nratio should equal to one (Dawid 2002). What about the prior odds\n\n\\[\\frac{\\Pr(\\textsf{kill})}{\\Pr(\\textsf{natural})}?\\]\n\n\nRecall the \\(\\slashfrac{1}{(73\\times 10^6)}\\) figure given by the\npediatrician Roy Meadow. This figure was intended to convey how\nunlikely it was that two babies would die of natural causes, one after\nthe other. If it is so unlikely that both would die of natural\ncauses\u2014one might reason\u2014it must be likely that they did\nnot actually die of natural causes and quite likely that Clark killed\nthem. But did she?\n\nThe prior probability that they died of natural causes should be\ncompared to the prior probability that a mother would kill them. To\nhave a rough idea, suppose that in a mid-size country like the United Kingdom 1\nmillion babies are born every year of whom 100 are murdered by their\nmothers. So the chance that a mother would kill one baby in a year is\n1 in 10,000. What is the chance that the same mother kills\ntwo babies? Say we appeal to the (controversial) assumption\nof independence. On this assumption, the chance that a mother kills\ntwo babies equals 1 in 100 million. Assuming independence,\n\n\\[\\Pr(\\textsf{natural})=\\frac{1}{73\\times10^6}\\]\n\n\nand \n\n\\[\\Pr(\\textsf{kill})=\\frac{1}{100\\times 10^6}.\\]\n\n\nThis means that the prior odds \nwould equal .73. With a likelihood ratio of one, the posterior odds\nwould also equal .73. On this analysis, that Clark killed her sons\nwould be .73 times less likely than they died of natural causes, or in\nother words, the natural cause hypothesis is 1.37 times more likely\nthan the hypothesis that Clark killed her sons.\n\nA limitation of this analysis should be kept in mind. The .73 ratio is\na measure of the probability of one hypothesis compared to another.\nFrom this ratio alone, the posterior probability of the individual\nhypotheses cannot be deduced. Only if the competing hypotheses \\(H\\)\nand \\(H'\\) are exclusive and exhaustive, say one is the negation\nof the other, can the posterior probability be derived from the\nposterior odds \n\n\\[PO=\\frac{P(H \\pmid E)}{ P(H' \\pmid E)}\\]\n\n\nvia the equality \n\n \\[\\Pr(H\\pmid E)= \\frac{PO}{1+PO}.\\]\n\n\nBut the hypotheses kill and natural\nare not exhaustive, since the two\nbabies could have died in other ways. So the posterior odds\n\n  \\[\\frac{\\Pr(\\textsf{kill} \\pmid \\textsf{two deaths})}{\\Pr(\\textsf{natural} \\pmid \\textsf{two deaths})}\\] \n\n\ncannot be translated into the posterior probabilities of individual\nhypotheses. (A more sophisticated probabilistic analysis is presented in\n \u00a73.3.)\n1.4 Where do the numbers come from?\n\nIn the examples considered so far, probabilities were assigned on the\nbasis of empirical frequencies and expert opinions. For example, an\nexpert testimony that only 5% of people possess a particular blood\ntype was used to set \\(\\Pr(\\match \\pmid \\neg \\source)=.05\\).\nProbabilities were also assigned on the basis of common sense, for\nexample, \\(\\Pr(\\match \\pmid \\source)\\) was set to 1 assuming that if\nsomeone is the source of the crime traces, the person must match the\ncrime traces (setting aside the possibility of framing, fabrication of\nthe traces or false negatives in the test results). But probabilities\nneed not always be assigned exact values. Agreeing on an exact value\ncan in fact be extremely difficult, especially for prior\nprobabilities. This is a challenge for legal probabilism (see later in\n \u00a77.3).\n One way to circumvent this challenge is to avoid setting exact values\nand adopt plausible intervals. This method is based on sensitivity\nanalysis, an assessment of how prior probabilities affect other\nprobabilities.\n\nConsider the paternity case State v. Boyd (331\nN.W.2d 480, Minn. 1983). Expert witness Dr. Polesky testified\nthat 1,121 unrelated men would have to be randomly selected from the\ngeneral population before another man could be found with all the\nappropriate genes to have fathered the child in question. This formulation can be misleading since the expected number of matching DNA profiles need not be the same as the number of matching profiles actually found in a population (the error of thinking otherwise is called the expected value fallacy). On a more careful formulation, the probability that a random person \nwould be a  match is \\(\\slashfrac{1}{1121}\\), or in\nsymbols,  \n\n  \\[\\Pr(\\match\\pmid \\neg \\textsf{father})=\\frac{1}{1121}.\\]\n\n\nAs explained earlier in\n \u00a71.2.3,\n this probability cannot be easily translated into the probability\nthat a person whose genetic profile matches is the father, or in\nsymbols, \\(\\Pr(\\textsf{father}\\pmid \\match)\\). The latter should be\ncalculated using Bayes\u2019 theorem:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\Pr(\\textsf{father}\\pmid \\match) & = \n    \\frac{\n        \\Pr(\\match\\pmid \\textsf{father}) \\times \\Pr(\\textsf{father})\n        }\n        {\n\\Pr(\\match \\pmid \\textsf{father}) \\times \\Pr(\\textsf{father}) +\n  \\Pr(\\match \\pmid \\textsf{not-father}) \\times \\Pr(\\textsf{not-father})      \n  }   \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n In actual practice, the formula to establish paternity is more\ncomplicated (Kaiser and Seber, 1983), but for the sake of\nillustration, we abstract away from this complexity. Suppose the prior\nprobability that the defendant would be the father is as low as .01,\nor in symbols, \\(\\Pr(\\textsf{father})=.01\\).  Plugging in this prior\nprobability into Bayes theorem, along with \\(\\Pr(\\textsf{m}\\pmid\n\\textsf{father})=1\\) and \\(\\Pr(\\textsf{m}\\pmid\n\\textsf{not-father})=1/1,121\\), gives a probability of paternity\n\\(\\Pr(\\textsf{father}\\pmid \\textsf{m})\\) that is equal to about .92.\n But why take the prior probability \\(\\Pr(\\textsf{father})\\) to be .01\nand not something else? The idea in sensitivity analysis is to look at a range of plausible probability assignments and investigate the impact of such choices. In\nlegal applications, the key question is whether assignments that are\nmost favorable to the defendant would still return a strong\nevidentiary case against the defendant. In the case at hand, the\nexpert testimony is so strong that for a wide spectrum of the prior\nprobability \\(\\Pr(\\textsf{father})\\), the posterior probability\n\\(\\Pr(\\textsf{father} \\pmid \\match)\\) remains high, as the plot in\n figure 1\n shows.\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\nThe posterior surpasses .9 once the prior is above approximately .008.\nIn a paternity case, given the mother\u2019s testimony and other\nevidence, it is clear that the probability of fatherhood before the\nexpert testimony is taken into account should be higher than that, no\nmatter what the prior probability should exactly be. Without settling\non an exact value, the interval of values above .008 would guarantee a\nposterior probability of paternity to be at least .9. This is amply\nsufficient to meet the preponderance standard that governs civil cases\nsuch as paternity disputes (on standards of proof, see later in\n Section 5.)\n1.5 Source, activity and offense level hypotheses\n\nDifficulties in assessing probabilities go hand in hand with the\nchoice of the hypotheses of interest. To some approximation,\nhypotheses can be divided into three levels: offence, activity, and\nsource level hypotheses. At the offence level, the issue is whether\nthe defendant is guilty, as in the statement \u201cSmith is guilty of\nmanslaughter\u201d. At the activity level, hypotheses describe what\nhappened and what those involved did or did not do. An example of\nactivity level hypothesis is \u201cSmith stabbed the victim\u201d.\nFinally, source level hypotheses describe the source of the traces,\nsuch as \u201cThe victim left the stains at the scene\u201d, without\nspecifying how the traces got there. Overlooking differences in\nhypothesis level can lead to serious confusions.\n\nConsider a case in which a DNA match is the primary incriminating\nevidence. DNA evidence is one of the most widely used forms of\nquantitative evidence currently available, but it does not work much\ndifferently from blood evidence or other forms of trace evidence. In\ntestifying about a DNA match, trial experts will often assess the\nprobability that a random person, unrelated to the crime, would\ncoincidentally match the crime stain profile (Foreman et al. 2003).\nThis is called the Genotype Probability or Random Match Probability,\nwhich can be extremely low, in the order of 1 in 100 million or even\nlower (Donnelly 1995; Kaye and Sensabaugh 2011; Wasserman 2002). It\nis tempting to equate the random match probability to \\(\\Pr(\\match\n\\pmid \\textsf{innocence})\\) and together with the prior\n\\(\\Pr(\\textsf{innocence})\\) use Bayes\u2019 theorem to calculate the\nposterior probability of innocence \\(\\Pr(\\textsf{innocence} \\pmid\n\\match)\\). This would be a mistake. Applying Bayes\u2019 theorem is\nof course recommended and helps to avoid the prosecutor\u2019s\nfallacy, the conflation of \\(\\Pr(\\textsf{innocence} \\pmid \\match)\\)\nand \\(\\Pr(\\match \\pmid \\textsf{innocence})\\). The problem here lies\nelsewhere. Equating the random match probability with \\(\\Pr(\\match\n\\pmid \\textsf{innocence})\\) overlooks the difference between offense,\nactivity and source level hypotheses. A DNA match cannot speak\ndirectly to the question of guilt or innocence. Even if the suspect is the source of the genetic material at the scene, the match does not establish that the\ndefendant did visit the scene and came into contact with the victim, and even if they did, it does not follow that they committed the crime they were accused\nof.\n\nFew forms of evidence can speak directly to offense level hypotheses.\nCircumstantial evidence that is more amenable to a probabilistic\nquantification, such as DNA matches and other trace evidence, does\nnot. Eyewitness testimony may speak more directly to offense level\nhypotheses, but it is also less easily amenable to a probabilistic\nquantification (see however Friedman 1987, recent results by Wixted\nand Wells 2017, and a survey of related issues by Urbaniak et\nal. 2020). This makes it difficult to assign probabilities to offense\nlevel hypotheses. Moving beyond source level hypotheses requires a\nclose collaboration between scientists, investigators and attorneys\n(see Cook et al. 1998 for a discussion).\n2. The Strength of Evidence\n\nThe posterior probability of a hypothesis given the evidence should\nnot be confused with the strength (or probative value, weight) of the\nevidence in favor of the hypothesis. The strength of an item of\nevidence reflects its impact on the probability of the hypothesis.\nSuppose the prior probability of \\(H\\) is extremely low, say\n\\(\\Pr(H)=.001\\), but taking evidence \\(E\\) into account brings this\nprobability up to 35%, that is, \\(\\Pr(H \\pmid E)=.35\\). This is a\ndramatic upward shift. Even though the posterior probability of \\(H\\)\ngiven \\(E\\) is not high, \\(E\\) strongly favors \\(H\\). This section\nexamines how probability theory helps to assess the strength of\nevidence.\n2.1 Bayes factor v. likelihood ratio\n\nThe notion of strength of evidence\u2014as distinct from prior and\nposterior probability\u2014can be captured formally in a number of\ndifferent ways (for a comprehensive discussion, see the entry on\n confirmation theory).\n One measure of the strength of evidence is the Bayes factor\n\n \\[\\frac{\\Pr(E \\pmid H)}{\\Pr(E)}\\]\n\n\n(already discussed in\n \u00a71.2.3).\n This is an intuitively plausible measure of evidential strength. Note\nthat by Bayes\u2019 theorem \n\n \\[\n\\Pr(H \\pmid E)  = \\textit{BayesFactor}(H, E) \\times \\Pr(H),\\]\n\n\nand thus the Bayes factor is greater than one if and only if the\nposterior probability \\(\\Pr(H \\pmid E)\\) is higher than the prior\nprobability \\(\\Pr(H)\\). The greater the Bayes factor (for values\nabove one), the greater the upward shift from prior to posterior\nprobability, the more strongly \\(E\\) positively supports \\(H\\).\nConversely, the smaller the Bayes factor (for values below one),\nthe greater the downward shift from prior to posterior probability,\nthe more strongly \\(E\\) negatively supports \\(H\\). If\n\\(\\Pr(H)=\\Pr(H\\pmid E)\\) the evidence has no impact, upwards or\ndownwards, on the prior probability of \\(H\\).\n\nThe Bayes factor\nis an absolute measure of evidence \\(E\\)\u2019s support toward \\(H\\)\nsince it compares the probability of \\(E\\) under hypothesis \\(H\\)\nagainst the probability of \\(E\\) in general. The denominator is\ncalculated following the law of total probability:  \n\n\\[\\Pr(E)= \\Pr(E \\pmid H) \\Pr(H)+\\Pr(E \\pmid \\neg H) \\Pr(\\neg H).\\]\n\n\nThe catch-all alternative hypothesis \\(\\neg H\\) can be replaced by a\nmore fine-grained set of alternatives, say \\(H_1, H_2, \\dots H_k\\),\nprovided \\(H\\) and its alternatives cover the entire space of\npossibilities. The law of total probability would then read: \n\n\\[\\Pr(E)  = \\Pr(E\\pmid H)\\Pr(H) +\\sum_{i=1}^k \\Pr(E\\pmid H_i)\\Pr(H_i).\\]\n\n Instead of Bayes factor, the strength of evidence can be assessed by means of the likelihood ratio, a comparative measure of\nwhether evidence \\(E\\) supports a hypothesis \\(H\\) more than a\ncompeting hypothesis \\(H'\\), in symbols,  \n\n\\[\\frac{\\Pr(E \\pmid H)}{\\Pr(E \\pmid H')}.\\]\n\n\nAn expert, for instance, may testify that the blood-staining on the\njacket of the defendant is ten times more likely to be seen if the\nwearer of the jacket hit the victim (hypothesis \\(H\\)) rather than if\nhe did not (hypothesis \\(H'\\)) (Aitken, Roberts, & Jackson\n2010, 38). If the evidence supports \\(H\\) more than \\(H'\\), the\nratio would be above one, and if the evidence supports \\(H'\\) more\nthan \\(H\\), the ratio would be below one. The greater the likelihood\nratio (for values above one), the stronger the evidence in favor of\n\\(H\\) as contrasted with \\(H'\\). The smaller the likelihood ratio\n(for values below one), the stronger the evidence in favor of the\ncompeting hypothesis \\(H'\\) as contrasted with \\(H\\).\n\nThe relationship between likelihood ratio \n\n\\[\\frac{\\Pr(E \\pmid H)}{\\Pr(E \\pmid H')}\\]\n\n\nand posterior odds \n\n\\[\\frac{\\Pr(H \\pmid E)}{\\Pr(H' \\pmid E)}\\]\n\n\nis apparent in the odds version of Bayes\u2019 theorem (see earlier\nin\n \u00a71.3).\n If the likelihood ratio is greater (lower) than one, the posterior\nodds will be greater (lower) than the prior odds of \\(H\\). The\nlikelihood ratio, then, is a measure of the upward or downward impact\nof the evidence on the odds of two hypotheses \\(H\\) and\n\\(H'\\).\n\nA competitor of the likelihood ratio as a measure of evidentiary\nstrength is an even simpler notion, the probability \\(\\Pr(E \\pmid\nH)\\). It is tempting to think that, whenever \\(\\Pr(E \\pmid H)\\) is\nlow, \\(E\\) should be strong evidence against \\(H\\). Consider an\nexample by Triggs and Buckleton (2014). In a child abuse\ncase, the prosecutor offers evidence that a couple\u2019s child rocks\n(a movement pattern) and that only 3% of non-abused children rock,\n\\(\\Pr(\\textsf{child rocks} \\pmid \\textsf{no abuse})=.03\\). If it is\nunlikely that a non-abused child would rock, the fact that this child\nrocks might seem strong evidence of abuse. But this reading of the 3%\nfigure is mistaken. It could well be that 3% of abused children rock,\n\\(\\Pr(\\textsf{child rocks} \\pmid \\textsf{abuse})=.03\\). If rocking is\nunlikely under either hypothesis\u2014which means the likelihood\nratio \n\n\\[\\frac{\\Pr(\\textsf{child rocks} \\pmid \\textsf{abuse})}{\\Pr(\\textsf{child rocks} \\pmid \\textsf{no abuse})}\\]\n\n\nequals one\u2014rocking cannot count as evidence of abuse. In order\nto avoid exaggerations of the evidence, it is best to assess it by\nmeans of the likelihood ratio rather the probability of the evidence\ngiven a hypothesis (ENFSI 2015; Royall 1997).\n2.2 Cold-hit DNA matches\n\nTo better understand likelihood ratios, it is instructive to look at\nDNA evidence as a case study, focusing in particular on cold-hit\nmatches. DNA evidence may be used to corroborate other evidence in a\ncase or as the primary incriminating evidence. Suppose different\ninvestigative leads point to an individual, Mark Smith, as the\nperpetrator. Suppose the investigators also find several traces at the\ncrime scene left by the perpetrator, and laboratory analyses show that\nthe genetic profile associated with the traces matches Smith. In this\nscenario, the DNA match corroborates the other evidence against Smith.\nIn contrast, suppose no investigative lead allowed the police to identify a suspect. The only evidence consists of the traces found at the crime scene.\nThe police run the genetic profile associated with the traces through a\ndatabase of profiles and find a match, a so-called cold-hit.\nSince in cold-hit cases there is no other evidence, cold-hit matches\nare the primary item of evidence against the defendant. Some scholars\nbelieve that this circumstance weakens the evidentiary value of the\nmatch. Others disagree. We now examine some of the main\narguments in this debate.\n2.2.1 Random match v. database match\n\nSuppose an expert testifies that the crime traces genetically match\nthe defendant and that the random match probability is extremely low,\nsay 1 in 100 million. The random match probability\u2014often\ninterpreted as the probability that someone who is not the source\nwould coincidentally match, \\(\\Pr(\\match \\pmid \\neg\n\\source)\\)\u2014is a common measure of the strength of a DNA match.\nThe lower this probability, the more strongly incriminating the match.\nStrictly speaking, a match is strong evidence that the defendant is\nthe source only if the likelihood ratio \n\n \\[\\frac{\\Pr(\\textsf{DNA match} \\pmid \\source)}{\\Pr(\\textsf{DNA match} \\pmid \\neg \\source)}\\]\n\n\nis significantly greater than one. In practice, however, when the\nrandom match probability is low\u2014that is, \\(\\Pr(\\match \\pmid \\neg\n\\source)\\) is low\u2014the likelihood ratio should be significantly\nabove one because the probability that the individual who is the\nsource would match, \\(\\Pr(\\match \\pmid \\source)\\), should be high so\nlong as the test has a low false negative rate. For practical\npurposes, then, a low random match probability does count as strong\nincriminating evidence.\n\nWhen it comes to cold-hit matches, however, further complications\narise. The Puckett case can serve as an illustration. In 2008, John\nPuckett was identified through a database search of 338,000 profiles.\nHe was the only individual in the database who matched the traces\ncollected from Diana Sylvester, a victim of rape in 1972. The expert\nwitness testified that Puckett\u2019s genetic profile should occur\nrandomly among Caucasian men with a frequency of 1 in 1.1 million.\nThis would seem strong evidence against Puckett\u2019s innocence. But\nthe DNA expert for the defense, Bicka Barlow, pointed out that besides\nthe cold-hit match the evidence against Puckett was slim. Barlow\nargued that the correct assessment of the cold-hit match required to\nmultiply 1/1.1 million by the size of the database. Call the result of\nthis multiplication the database match probability.\nMultiplying 1/1.1 million by 338,000 yields a database match\nprobability of roughly 1/3, an unimpressive figure. If someone in the\ndatabase could match with a probability of 1/3, the cold-hit match\nshould not count as strong evidence against Puckett. This was\nBarlow\u2019s argument.\n\nBarlow followed a 1996 report by the National Research Council, often\nreferred to as NRC II (National Research Council 1996). The report\nrecommended that in cold-hit cases the random match probability should\nbe multiplied by the size of the database. This correction was meant\nto guard against the heightened risk of mistaken matches for the\ninnocent people in the database. NRC II used an analogy. If you toss\nseveral different coins at once and all show heads on the first\nattempt, this outcome seems strong evidence that the coins are biased. If,\nhowever, you repeat this experiment sufficiently many times, it is\nalmost certain that at some point all coins will land heads. This\noutcome should not count as evidence that the coins are biased.\nAccording to NRC II, repeating the coin toss experiment multiple times\nis analogous to trying to find a match by searching through a database\nof profiles. As the size of the database increases, it is more likely\nthat someone in the database who had nothing to do with the crime\nwould match.\n\nThe aptness of the analogy has been challenged (Donnelly and\nFriedman 1999). Searching a larger database no doubt increases the\nprobability of finding a match at some point. But the relevant proposition here is not  \u201cAt least one of the\nprofiles in the database would randomly match the crime sample\u201d.\nRather, the relevant proposition is \u201cThe profile of the\ndefendant on trial would randomly match the crime sample\u201d. The\nprobability of finding a match between the defendant and the crime\nsample does not increase because other people in the database are\ntested. In fact, suppose everyone in the world is recorded in the\ndatabase. A unique cold-hit match would be extremely strong evidence\nof guilt since everybody would be excluded as a suspect except one\nmatching individual. Instead, if the random match probability were\nmultiplied by the size of the database, the probative value of the\nmatch should be quite low. This is counter-intuitive.\n\nAnother analogy is sometimes used to argue that the evidentiary value\nof a cold-hit match should be weakened. The analogy is between\nsearching for a match in a database and multiple hypothesis testing,\nan objectionable research practice. In classical hypothesis testing,\nif the probability of type I error in a single test of a hypothesis is\n.05, this probability will increase by testing the same hypothesis\nmultiple times. The database match probability\u2014the argument\ngoes\u2014would correct for the increased risk of type I error.\nHowever, as Balding (2002, 2005) points out, multiple testing consists\nin testing the same hypothesis multiple times against new\nevidence. In cold-hit cases, multiple hypotheses\u2014each concerning\na different individual in the database\u2014are tested only once and\nthen excluded if a negative match occurs. From this perspective, the\nhypothesis that the defendant is the source is one of the many\nhypotheses subject to testing. The cold-hit match supports that\nhypothesis and rules out the others.\n2.2.2 The likelihood ratio of cold-hit matches\n\nA more principled way to assess cold-hit matches is based on the\nlikelihood ratio. The proposal draws from the literature on the\nso-called island problem, studied by Eggleston (1978), Dawid\n(1994), and Dawid and Mortera (1996). Let the prosecutor\u2019s\nhypothesis \\(H_p\\) be \u201cThe suspect is the source of the crime\ntraces\u201d and the defense hypothesis \\(H_d\\) be \u201cThe suspect\nis not the source of the crime traces\u201d. Let \\(M\\) be the DNA\nmatch between the crime stain and the suspect (included in the\ndatabase) and \\(D\\) the information that no one among the profiles in\nthe database, except for the suspect, matches the crime stain. The\nlikelihood ratio associated with \\(M\\) and \\(D\\) should be (Balding\nand Donnelly 1996; Taroni et al. 2014):\n\n \\[V  = \\frac{\\Pr(M,D\\pmid H_p)}{\\Pr(M,D\\pmid H_d)}.\\]\n\n\nSince \\(\\Pr(A\\wedge B)=\\Pr(A\\pmid B)\\times \\Pr(B)\\), for any statement\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\), this ratio can be written as  \n\n\\[\nV  = \\frac{\\Pr(M\\pmid H_p,D)}{\\Pr(M\\pmid H_d,D)} \\times \\frac{\\Pr(D\\pmid H_p)}{\\Pr(D\\pmid H_d)}.\\]\n\n\nThe first ratio \n\n\\[\\frac{\\Pr(M\\pmid H_p,D)}{\\Pr(M\\pmid H_d,D)}\\]\n\n\nis roughly \\(\\slashfrac{1}{\\gamma}\\), where \\(\\gamma\\) is the random\nmatch probability. The second ratio  \n\n\\[\\frac{\\Pr(D\\pmid H_p)}{\\Pr(D\\pmid H_d)}\\]\n\n\nis the database search ratio, defined as follows (for details, see\nBalding and Donnelly 1996; Taroni et al. 2014): \n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\Pr(D\\pmid H_p)}{\\Pr(D\\pmid H_d)}  = \\frac{1}{1-\\varphi},\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(\\Pr(S \\pmid H_d)=\\varphi\\) and \\(S\\) stands for the\nproposition that someone in the database is the source of the crime\ntraces. Donnelly and Friedman (1999) derived a similar formula for\nthis ratio. As the database gets larger, \\(\\varphi\\) increases and the\ndatabase search ratio increases. This ratio equals one only if no one\nin the database could be the source.\n\nSince the likelihood ratio \\(V\\) of the cold-hit match results by\nmultiplying the likelihood ratio of the DNA match and the database\nsearch ratio, \\(V\\) will always be greater than the mere likelihood\nratio of the match (except for the unrealistic case in which\n\\(\\varphi=0\\)) . Thus, a cold-hit DNA match should count as stronger\nevidence than a DNA match of a previously identified suspect. Dawid\nand Mortera (1996) study different database search strategies and\nconsider the possibility that information about the match is itself\nuncertain, but the general point remains. Under reasonable\nassumptions, ignoring the database search would give a conservative\nassessment of the evidentiary strength of the cold-hit match.\n\nThere is intuitive resistance in basing a conviction on a cold-hit\nmatch, but this resistance is less strong in case of an ordinary match\n(more on this later in\n Section 6).\n This preference for convictions based on an ordinary DNA match seems\nin tension with the claim that a cold-hit match is stronger evidence\nof guilt than an ordinary match. There is a way to reconcile both\nsides, however. The key is to keep in mind that the evidentiary\nstrength\u2014measured by the likelihood ratio\u2014should not be\nconfused with the posterior probability of guilt given the evidence.\nIf the cold-hit match is the only evidence of guilt, the posterior\nprobability of guilt may well be lower compared to cases in which\nother evidence, such as investigative leads, supplements the DNA\nmatch. This lower posterior probability would justify the intuitive\nresistance towards convictions in cold-hit cases despite the stronger\nprobative value of the cold-hit match.\n2.3 Choosing competing hypotheses\n\nThe likelihood ratio is helpful for assessing the strength of the\nevidence, as the preceding discussion about cold-hit matches shows.\nOne major difficulty, however, is the choice of the hypotheses \\(H\\)\nand \\(H'\\) that should be compared. The hypotheses should compete\nwith one another\u2014say, in a criminal trial, \\(H\\) is the\nhypothesis put forward by the prosecution and \\(H'\\) is the\nhypothesis put forward by the defense. But this constraint leaves open\nthe possibility for manipulations and misinterpretations of the\nevidence. Let us examine some of the main controversies in the\nliterature on this topic.\n2.3.1 Ad hoc hypotheses and Barry George\n\nConsider again a stylized DNA evidence case. Suppose the prosecutor puts\nforward the hypothesis that the suspect left the traces found at the\ncrime scene. This hypothesis is well supported by laboratory analyses\nshowing that the defendant genetically matches the traces. The\ndefense, however, responds by putting forward the following ad\nhoc hypothesis: \u201cThe crime stain was left by some unknown\nperson who happened to have the same genotype as the suspect\u201d.\nSince the probability of the DNA match given either hypothesis is 1,\nthe likelihood ratio equals 1 (Evett, Jackson, and Lambert 2000).\nThe problem generalizes. For any item of evidence and any given\nprosecutor\u2019s hypothesis \\(H\\), there is an ad hoc\ncompeting hypothesis \\(H^*\\) such that \n\n\\[\\frac{\\Pr(E \\pmid H)}{\\Pr(E \\pmid H^*)}=1.\\]\n\n\nHypothesis \\(H^*\\) is a just-so hypothesis, one that is selected only\nbecause it explains the evidence just as well as hypothesis \\(H\\) does\n(Mayo 2018: 30\u201355). If no further constraints are placed on the choice of the\ncompeting hypotheses\u2014it would seem\u2014no evidence could ever\nincriminate a defendant.\n\nJudges and jurors will often recognize ad hoc hypotheses for\nwhat they are\u2014artificial theories that should not be taken\nseriously. Perhaps, the common sense of the participants in a trial\nwill suffice to constrain the choice of hypotheses in the right way.\nBut real cases are complex, and it is not always obvious whether a\nchoice of competing hypotheses, which are not obviously ad\nhoc, is legitimate or not.\n\nA notable example is R. v. George (2007 EWCA\nCrim 2722). Barry George was accused of murdering British\njournalist and TV celebrity Jill Dando. A single particle of firearm\nresidue was found one year later in George\u2019s coat pocket and it\nmatched the residue from the crime scene. This was the key\nincriminating evidence against him. George was convicted, and his\nfirst appeal was unsuccessful. After the first appeal, Ian Evett from\nthe Forensic Science Service worried that the evidence had not been\nproperly assessed at trial. The jurors were presented with the\nconditional probability of finding the firearm residue in\nGeorge\u2019s coat given the defense hypothesis that George did\nnot fire the gun. This probability was estimated to be quite low.\nBut the jurors were not presented with the conditional probability of\nfinding the same evidence given the prosecutor\u2019s hypothesis that\nGeorge did fire the gun that shot Dando. An expert witness,\nMr. Keeley, was asked to provide both conditional probabilities and\nestimated them to be \\(\\slashfrac{1}{100}\\), which indicated that the\nfirearm residue had no probative value. George appealed again in 2007,\nand relying on Keely\u2019s estimates, won the appeal.\n A study of the trial transcript shows that Keeley\u2019s choice\nof hypotheses lacked coherence and the likelihood ratio based on them\nwas therefore meaningless. On one occasion, Keeley compared the\nhypothesis that the particle found in George\u2019s pocket came from\na gun fired by George himself, and the alternative hypothesis that the\nparticle came from another source. On another occasion, Keeley took\nthe prosecutor\u2019s hypothesis to be \u201cThe particle found in\nGeorge\u2019s pocket came from the gun that killed Dando.\u201d But\nthe conditional probability of the evidence given this hypothesis\nshould not be low. It should actually be one. The most charitable\nreading of the trial transcript suggests that the expert had in mind\nthe hypotheses \u201cGeorge was the man who shot Dando\u201d and\n\u201cThe integrity of George\u2019s coat was corrupted\u201d. But\nKeeley gave no justification for why these hypotheses should be\ncompared in the likelihood ratio (see Fenton et al. 2014 for\ndetails).\n\nA related complication is that competing hypotheses can concern any\nfactual dispute, from minute details such as whether the cloth used to\nsuffocate the victim was red or blue, to ultimate questions such as\nwhether the defendant stabbed the victim. The likelihood ratio varies\nacross hypotheses formulated at different levels of granularity:\noffense, activity and source level hypotheses (on this distinction,\nsee earlier in\n \u00a71.5).\n It is even possible that, at the source level, the likelihood ratio\nfavors one side, say the prosecution, but at the offence level, the\nlikelihood ratio favors the other side, say the defense, even though\nthe hypotheses at the two levels are quite similar (Fenton, et\nal. 2014).\n2.3.2 Exclusive and exhaustive?\n\nThe confusion in the Barry George case is attributable to the absence\nof clear rules for choosing the hypotheses in the likelihood ratio.\nOne such rule could be: pick competing hypotheses that are exclusive\n(they cannot be both true) and exhaustive (they cannot be both false).\nIn this way, the parties would not be able to pick ad hoc\nhypotheses and skew the assessment of the evidence in their own\nfavor.\n There are other good reasons why the hypotheses in the likelihood ratio should be exclusive and exhaustive. For if they are not, the likelihood ratio can deliver counterintuitive results. To see why, first consider hypotheses that are not mutually exclusive. Let \\(H_p\\) stand for \u201cThe defendant\nis guilty\u201d and \\(H_d\\) for \u201cThe defendant was not at the\ncrime scene\u201d. Let \\(E\\) stand for \n\n\nTen minutes before the crime took place the defendant\u2014seen at a\ndifferent location\u2014was overheard on the phone saying go\nahead and kill him. \n\n\nThe evidence positively supports each hypothesis, yet it is\nconceivable that the likelihood ratio should equal one in this\ncontext. Further, consider two competing hypotheses that are not\nexhaustive. Suppose Fred and Bill attempted to rob a man. The victim\nresisted, was struck on the head and died. Say \\(H_p\\) stand for\n\u201cFred struck the fatal blow\u201d and \\(H_d\\) stand for\n\u201cBill struck the fatal blow\u201d. The hypotheses are not\nexhaustive because a third hypothesis is \u201cThe man did not die\nfrom the blow\u201d. Suppose \\(E\\) is the information that the victim\nhad a heart attack six months earlier. The likelihood ratio\n\n\\[\\frac{\\Pr(E \\pmid H_p)}{\\Pr(E \\pmid H_d)}\\]\n\n\nequals one since \n\n\\[\\Pr(E\\pmid H_p)=\\Pr(E\\pmid H_d).\\]\n\n\nYet \\(E\\) reduces the probability of both \\(H_p\\) and \\(H_d\\). So, in\nthis case, the evidence negatively supports each hypothesis, contrary\nto what the likelihood ratio suggests.\n\nBut relying on exclusive and exhaustive hypotheses is not without\ncomplications either. Consider an expert who decides to formulate the\ndefense hypothesis by negating the prosecution hypothesis, say,\n\u201cthe defendant did not hit the victim in the head\u201d. This\nchoice of defense hypothesis can be unhelpful in assessing the\nevidence. What is the probability that the suspect would carry such\nand such blood stain if he did not hit the victim in the head? This\ndepends on whether he was present at the scene, what he was doing at\nthe time and many other circumstances. As Evett, Jackson, and Lambert\n(2000) point out, the choice of a particular hypothesis to be used in\nthe evaluation of the strength of the evidence will depend on\ncontextual factors. More often than not, the hypotheses chosen will\nnot be mutually exclusive. Comparing exclusive and exhaustive\nhypotheses can also be unhelpful for jurors or judges making a\ndecision at trial. In a paternity case, for example, the expert should\nnot compare the hypotheses \u201cThe accused is the father of the\nchild\u201d and its negation, but rather, \u201cThe accused is the\nfather of the child\u201d and \u201cThe father of the child is a man\nunrelated to the putative father\u201d (Biedermann et al.\n2014). Even though the relatives of the accused are potential fathers,\nconsidering such a far-fetched possibility would make the assessment\nof the evidence more difficult than needed (Evett et al. 2000).\n\nExclusive and exhaustive hypotheses guard against arbitrary\ncomparisons and ensure a more principled assessment of the evidence.\nThe drawback is that such hypotheses cover the entire space of\npossibilities, and sifting through this space is cognitively\nunfeasible (Allen 2017). In this respect, comparing more circumscribed hypotheses\nis preferable. The danger of doing so, however, is that likelihood\nratios heavily depend on the hypotheses that are compared. The more\nlatitude in the choice of the hypotheses, the more variable the\nlikelihood ratio as a measure of evidentiary value.\n2.4 The two-stain problem\n\nA case study that further illustrates the limitations of the\nlikelihood ratio as a measure of evidentiary strength is the two-stain\nproblem, originally formulated by Evett (1987).\n\nIn Evett\u2019s original formulation, two stains from two different\nsources are left at the crime scene, and the suspect\u2019s blood\nmatches one of them. Let the first hypothesis be that the suspect was\none of the two men who committed the crime and the second hypothesis\nthe negation of the first. Evett (1987) shows (see his paper for\ndetails) that the likelihood ratio of the match relative to these two\nhypotheses is \\(\\slashfrac{1}{2q_1}\\) where \\(q_1\\) is the estimated\nfrequency of the characteristics of the first stain. Surprisingly, the\nlikelihood ratio does not depend on the frequency associated with the\nsecond stain.\n\nConsider now a more complex two-stain scenario. Suppose a crime was\ncommitted by two people, who left two stains at the crime scene: one\non a pillow and another on a sheet. John Smith, who was arrested for a\ndifferent reason, genetically matches the DNA on the pillow, but not\nthe one on the sheet. Meester and Sjerps (2004) argue that there are\nthree plausible pairs of hypotheses associated with numerically\ndifferent likelihood ratios (see their paper for details). The three\noptions are listed in\n table 2,\n where \\(R\\) is the random match probability of Smith\u2019s genetic\nprofile and \\(\\delta\\) the prior probability that Smith was one of the\ncrime scene donors.\n\nTable 2\n\n\n\\(H_p\\)\n\\(H_d\\)\nLR  \n\n\nSmith was one of the crime scene donors.\nSmith was not one of the crime scene donors.\n\\(\\frac{R}{2}\\) \n\nSmith was the pillow stain donor.\nSmith was not one of the crime scene donors.\n\\(R\\) \n\nSmith was the pillow stain donor.\nSmith was not the pillow stain donor.\n\\(\\frac{R(2-\\delta)}{2(1-\\delta)}\\)\n \n\n\nEven though the likelihood ratios are numerically different, their\nposterior probabilities given the evidence are the same. Note that the\nprior odds of the three \\(H_p\\)\u2019s in the table should be written\nin terms of \\(\\delta\\). Following (Meester and Sjerps 2004), the\nprior odds of the first hypothesis in the table are\n\\(\\slashfrac{\\delta}{(1-\\delta)}\\). The prior odds of the second\nhypothesis are \\(\\slashfrac{(\\delta/2)}{(1-\\delta)}\\). The prior odds\nof the third hypothesis are\n\\(\\slashfrac{(\\delta/2)}{(1-(\\delta/2))}\\). In each case, the\nposterior odds\u2014the result of multiplying the prior odds by the\nlikelihood ratio\u2014are the same: \\(R\\times\n\\slashfrac{\\delta}{(2(1-\\delta))}\\). So despite differences in the\nlikelihood ratio, the posterior odds of the different hypotheses are\nthe same so long as the priors are appropriately related.\n\nMeester and Sjerps (2004) recommend that each likelihood ratio should\nbe accompanied by a tabular account of how a choice of prior odds (or\nprior probabilities) will impact the posterior odds, for a sensible\nrange of priors (for a general discussion of this strategy, called\n\u201csensitivity analysis\u201d, see earlier discussion in\n \u00a71.4).\n In this way, the impact of the likelihood ratio is made clear, no\nmatter the hypotheses chosen. This strategy concedes that likelihood\nratios are insufficiently informative, and that they should be\ncombined with other information, such as a range of priors, to allow\nfor an adequate assessment of the evidence.\n3. Bayesian Networks for Legal Applications\n So far we examined how probability theory can help to assess single items of evidence such as a DNA match. But things are often more complicated.\nIn legal cases, different lines of evidence may converge, such as two\nwitnesses who testify that the defendant was seen at the crime scene,\nor they may diverge, such as a witness who asserts the defendant was\nseen at the crime scene while DNA testing shows no genetic match\nbetween the defendant and the scene. Another source of complexity is\nthat the hypotheses put forward by the parties in a trial are often\ncomplex structures of statements. How can different statements, and\ntheir supporting evidence, be combined and the overall\nprosecutor\u2019s case (or the defense\u2019s case) be\nevaluated?\n\nThe probability of a hypothesis given multiple pieces of evidence can,\nin principle, be assessed by sequential applications of Bayes\u2019\ntheorem. Consider, for example, a case in which the defendant faces\ntwo pieces of incriminating evidence: a DNA match and hair evidence\nfound at the scene matching the defendant\u2019s hair color.\nAssume\u2014as is often done\u2014that someone\u2019s hair color is\nindependent of someone\u2019s genetic profile. Say the likelihood\nratio of hair evidence is 40 and the likelihood ratio of the DNA match\nis 200, that is, it is 40 times more likely (and 200 times more\nlikely) to find the evidence given the guilt hypothesis than the\ninnocence hypothesis. If the prior odds of guilt to innocence are\n\\(\\slashfrac{1}{1000}\\), the posterior odds would be\n\\(\\slashfrac{1}{1000}\\times 40\\times 200=8\\).\n\nThese calculations are straightforward, but in more realistic cases,\nthere will be complications. The parties at trial will often put\nforward several piecemeal claims that need to be combined together to\nform a theory of what happened. For example, the prosecutor may\npresent eyewitness testimony to argue that the defendant ran away from\nthe crime scene, along with documentary evidence as proof of a motive.\nThe different piecemeal claims, each supported by distinct pieces of\nevidence, must be combined to form structured hypotheses about what\nhappened. Since different claims and different pieces of evidence may\ndepend on one another, direct calculations would soon become\nunmanageable. Fortunately, a tool exists to make the task easier:\nBayesian networks. This section identifies guidelines for deploying\nBayesian networks in the presentation, aggregation and evaluation of\ncomplex bodies of evidence and hypotheses.\n3.1 Bayesian networks to the rescue\n\nThe idea that Bayesian networks can be used for probabilistic\nreasoning in legal fact-finding started gaining traction in late\neighties (Friedman 1986) and early nineties (Edwards 1991). Two\nrecent books on the topic with an emphasis on legal applications are\nFenton and Neil 2013 [2018] and Taroni et al. 2014. A Bayesian\nnetwork comprises two components: first, a directed acyclic graph of\nrelations of dependence (represented by arrows) between variables\n(represented by nodes); second, conditional probability tables.\nConsider the graphical component first. The graph is acyclic because\nthe arrows connecting the nodes do not form loops. As an illustration,\nlet \\(H\\) be the claim that the suspect committed the murder,\nBT the presence of a blood type B match with a crime scene\nstain, and \\(W\\) the fact that an eyewitness observed the suspect near\nthe scene around the time of the crime. The graphical component of the\nBayesian network would look like this:\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\nThe ancestors of a node \\(X\\) are all those nodes from which\nwe can reach \\(X\\) by following the arrows going forwards. The\nparents of a node \\(X\\) are those for which we can do this in\none step. The descendants of \\(X\\) are all which can be\nreached from \\(X\\) by following the arrows going forward. The\nchildren are those for which we can do this in one step. In\nthe example, \\(H\\) is the parent (and ancestor) of both \\(W\\) and\nBT, which are its children (and descendants). There are no\nnon-parent ancestors or non-children descendants.\n\nThe variables, which are represented by nodes and are connected by\narrows, stand in relation of probabilistic dependence. To describe\nthese relations, the graphical model is accompanied by conditional\nprobability tables. For parentless nodes such as \\(H\\), the tables\nspecify the prior probabilities of all their possible states. Assuming\n\\(H\\) stands for a binary random variable, with two possible states,\nthe prior probabilities could be:\n\nTable 3\n\n\n\nPrior  \n\n\n\\(H=\\text{murderer}\\)\n.01 \n\n\\(H=\\text{not.murderer}\\)\n.99  \n\n\nThe .01 figure for \\(H=\\text{murderer}\\) rests on the assumption that,\nabsent any incriminating evidence, the defendant is unlikely to be\nguilty. For children nodes, the tables specify their conditional\nprobability given combinations of their parents\u2019 states. If the\nvariables are binary, an assignment of values for them could be:\n\nTable 4\n\n\n\n\\(H=\\text{murderer}\\)\n\\(H=\\text{not.murderer}\\)  \n\n\n\\(W=\\text{seen}\\)\n.7\n.4 \n\n\\(W=\\text{not.seen}\\)\n.3\n.6  \n\n\nTable 5\n\n\n\n\\(H=\\text{murderer}\\)\n\\(H=\\text{not.murderer}\\)  \n\n\n\\(\\BT=\\text{match}\\)\n1\n.063 \n\n\\(\\BT=\\text{no.match}\\)\n0\n.937  \n\n\nAccording to the tables above, even if the defendant is not the\nculprit, the eyewitness testimony would still incriminate him with\nprobability of .4, while the blood evidence with probability equal to\nonly .063. The blood type frequency estimate is realistic (Lucy 2013:\n141), and so are the conditional probabilities for the eyewitness\nidentification. As expected, eyewitness testimony is assumed to be\nless trustworthy than blood match evidence (but for complications\nabout assessing eyewitness testimony, see Wixted and Wells 2017;\nUrbaniak et al. 2020).\n\nThe three probability tables above are all that is needed to define\nthe probability distribution. The tables do not specify probabilistic\ndependencies between nodes that are not in a relation of child/parent,\nsuch as BT and \\(W\\). Since there is no arrow between them,\nnodes BT and \\(W\\) are assumed to be independent conditional\non \\(H\\), that is, \\(\\Pr(W \\pmid H)=\\Pr(W \\pmid H \\wedge \\BT)\\). This\nfact represents, as part of the structure of the network, the\nindependence between eyewitness testimony and blood evidence. A\ngeneralization of this fact is the so-called Markov condition (see the\ntextbook by Neapolitan [2004] and the\n supplement on Bayesian networks\n of the entry on\n artificial intelligence.)\n\nWhile the Bayesian network above\u2014comprising a directed acyclic\ngraph along with probability tables\u2014is simple, a correct\nintuitive assessment of the probability of the hypothesis given the\nevidence is already challenging. Try to guess the probability that the\ndefendant committed the murder (\\(H=\\text{murderer}\\)) given the\nfollowing states of the evidence:\n\n\n\nThe suspect\u2019s blood type matches the crime stain but information\nabout the witness is unavailable.\n\n\nThe suspect\u2019s blood type matches the crime stain but the witness\nsays they did not see the suspect near the crime scene.\n\n\nThe suspect\u2019s blood type matches the crime stain and the witness\nsays they saw the suspect near the crime scene.\n\n\nAlready at this level of complexity, calculations by hand become\ncumbersome. In contrast, software for Bayesian networks (see, for\nexample, the \\(\\textsf{R}\\) package \\(\\textsf{bnlearn}\\) developed by\nMarco Scutari and described in Scutari and Denis 2015) will easily\ngive the following results:\n\nTable 6\n\n\n\n\\(H=\\text{murderer}\\)  \n\n\n\\(\\BT=\\text{match},W=?\\)\n.138 \n\n\\(\\BT=\\text{match},W=\\text{not.seen}\\)\n.074 \n\n\\(\\BT=\\text{match},\nW=\\text{seen}\\)\n.219  \n\n\nPerhaps surprisingly the posterior probability of \\(H\\) = murderer is about .22\neven when both pieces of evidence are incriminating\n(\\(\\BT=\\text{match}, W=\\text{seen}\\)).\n3.2 Idioms\n\n\nWhile modeling the relationships between evidence and hypotheses, simple graphical patterns (called idioms) are often used. Complex graphical models can be constructed by combining these basic patterns in a modular way. General methods for constructing Bayesian networks are discussed in (Neil, Fenton, and Nielson 2000;  \nHepler, Dawid, and Leucari 2007) and general idioms are discussed in\n(Fenton, Neil, and Lagnado 2013). A few of the basic idioms are\nillustrated below.\n\nThe evidence idiom is the most basic graphical representation\nof the relation between a hypothesis and a piece of evidence:\n\n\n\nFigure 3\n\n\nThis directed graph suggests that the direction of\ninfluence\u2014which could, but need not, be interpreted as causal\ninfluence\u2014goes from hypothesis to evidence (though the\nprobabilistic dependence goes both ways). The hypothesis node and the\nevidence node can be binary variables, such as \u201cThe defendant\nwas the source of the crime scene traces\u201d (hypothesis) and\n\u201cThe defendant genetically matches the crime traces\u201d\n(evidence). But the variables need not be binary. The hypothesis node\nmight take values from the range of 1\u201340, say the distance in\nmeters from which the gun was shot, and the evidence node might be a\ncontinuous variable representing the density of gun shot residues\n(Taroni et al. 2014).\n\nA more complex idiom, called the evidence accuracy idiom,\nconsists of two arrows going into the evidence node (Bovens and\nHartmann 2004; Fenton, Neil, and Lagnado 2013). One incoming arrow comes from the\nhypothesis node and the other from the accuracy node. This idiom can\nbe used to model, say, an alcohol test:\n\n\n\nFigure 4\n\n\nThe directions of the arrows indicate that the accuracy of the\nevidence (accuracy node) and the alcohol level (hypothesis node)\ninfluence the outcome of the test (evidence node). The graphical model\nrepresents different sources of uncertainty. The uncertainty\nassociated with the sensitivity and specificity of the test\u2014that\nis, the probability that the tests reports excessive alcohol level\nwhen the level is excessive (sensitivity) and the probability that the\ntest reports normal alcohol level when the level is normal\n(specificity)\u2014is captured by the arrow going from the hypothesis\nnode (Excess alcohol level) to the\nevidence node (Evidence for excess).\nOther sources of uncertainty comprise the possibility that the police\nofficer lied about the test report or the possibility that the driver\ntook medications which then affected the alcohol level. These\npossibilities can be taken into consideration by adding an accuracy\nnode (or multiple accuracy nodes, if each factor is kept separate from\nthe other).\n\nWhen multiple items of evidence depend on one another\u2014as may\nhappen in many legal cases\u2014this situation is modeled by the\nevidence dependency idiom. Following an example by Fenton and\nNeil (2013 [2018]), if one of two security cameras directed at the\nsame location captured an image of someone who looks like the\ndefendant but isn\u2019t him, it is likely that the same person\nwalked by the second camera, which also captured the same image. In\nsuch cases, presenting the second recording as independent from the\nfirst would lead to overestimating the strength of the evidence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNode\nProposition  \n\n\nH\nDefendant present at the scene\n\n\nC1\nCamera 1 captures image of a matching\nperson \n\nC2\nCamera 2 captures image of a matching\nperson \n\nD\nWhat cameras capture is dependent\n \n\n\nFigure 5\n\n\nThe network structure is quite natural. The truth of the hypothesis,\nsay, the defendant was present at the crime scene, influences whether\nthe cameras capture an image of someone who looks like the defendant.\nHowever, if the two camera recordings are dependent on one another\n(for instance, they are directed at the same spot with a similar\nangle), the fact that the second camera captured the same image as the\nfirst does not make the hypothesis more likely once the first camera\nrecording is known.\n\nFinally, the scenario idiom can model complex hypotheses,\nconsisting of a sequence of events organized in space and time (a\nscenario). A graphical model that uses the scenario idiom would\nconsist of the following components: first, nodes for the states and\nevents in the scenario, with each node linked to the supporting\nevidence; second, a separate scenario node that has states and events\nas its children; finally, a node corresponding to the ultimate\nhypothesis as a child of the scenario node. The graphical model would\nlook like this (Vlek et al. 2014):\n\n\n\nFigure 6 [An\n extended description of figure 6\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nThe scenario node unifies the different events and states. Because of\nthis unifying role, increasing the probability of one part of the\nscenario (say State/event 2) will also\nincrease the probability of the other parts (State/event\n1 and State/event\n3). This captures the fact that\nthe different components of a scenario form an interconnected sequence\nof events.\n\nA discussion of modeling crime scenarios by means of other graphical\ndevices (called structural scenario spaces) mixed with probabilities\ncan be found in the work of Shen et al. (2007); Bex (2011,\n2015); and Verheij (2017). See also the survey by Di Bello and Verheij\n(2018). Dawid and Mortera (2018) give a treatment of scenarios in\nterms of Bayesian networks. Lacave and D\u00edez (2002) show how\nBayesian Network can be used to construct explanations.\n3.3 Modeling an entire case\n\nKadane and Schum (2011) made one of the first attempts to model an entire\ncriminal case, Sacco and Vanzetti from 1920, using probabilistic\ngraphs. More recently, Fenton and Neil (2013 [2018]) constructed a\nBayesian network for the Sally Clark case (discussed earlier in\n \u00a71.3),\n reproduced below:\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7 [An\n extended description of figure 7\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nThe arrows depict relationships of influence between variables.\nWhether Sally Clark\u2019s sons, call them \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), died by\nSIDS or murder (A.cause and B.cause)\ninfluences whether signs of disease\n(A.disease and B.disease)\nand bruising (A.bruising\nand B.bruising)\nwere present. Since son \\(A\\)\ndied first, whether \\(A\\) was murdered or died by SIDS (A.cause)\ninfluences how son \\(B\\) died\n(B.cause). How the sons died\ndetermines how many sons were murdered (No.murdered),\nand how many sons were\nmurdered decides whether Sally Clark is guilty (Guilty).\n\nAccording to the calculation by Fenton and Neil (2013 [2018]) (see\ntheir paper for details), the prior probability of Guilty\n= Yes should be .0789. After taking into\naccount the incriminating evidence presented at trial, such as that\nthere were signs of bruising but no signs of a preexisting disease\naffecting the children, the posterior probabilities are as\nfollows:\n\nTable 8\n\n\nEvidence (cumulative)\n\\(\\Pr(\\textrm{Clark guilty})\\)  \n\n\nA bruising\n.2887 \n\nA no signs of disease\n.3093 \n\nB bruising\n.6913 \n\nB no signs of disease\n.7019  \n\n\nThe incriminating evidence, combined, brings the probability of guilt\nfrom .0789 to .7019. This is a significant increase, but not quite\nenough for a conviction. If one wishes to perform sensitivity\nanalysis\u2014see earlier discussion in\n \u00a71.4\u2014by\n modifying some of the probabilities, this can be easily done. During\nthe appeal trial, new evidence was discovered, in particular, evidence\nthat son \\(A\\) was affected by a disease. Once this evidence is taken\ninto account, the probability of guilt drops to .00459 (and if signs\nof disease were also present on \\(B\\), the guilt probability would\ndrop even further to .0009). For a general discussion on how to elicit\nprobabilities, see Renooij (2001) and Gaag et al.\n(1999).\n4. Relevance\n\nThe preceding sections modeled evidence assessment, using Bayes\u2019\ntheorem\n (Section 1),\n likelihood ratios\n (Section 2)\n and Bayesian networks\n (Section 3).\n Evidence assessment, however, begins with a preliminary decision, the\nidentification of relevant evidence. Once a piece of evidence is\ndeemed relevant, the next step is to assess its strength (probative\nvalue, weight). This section discusses how probability theory helps to\nidentify relevant evidence.\n4.1 Likelihood ratios\n\nThe U.S. Federal Rules of Evidence define relevant evidence as\nevidence that has \n\n\nany tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence\nto the determination of the action more probable or less probable than\nit would be without the evidence (rule 401). \n\n\nThis definition is formulated in a probabilistic language. Legal\nprobabilists interpret it using the likelihood ratio, a standard\nprobabilistic measure of evidential relevance (Aitken et al. 2010;\nAitken and Taroni 1995 [2004]; Lempert 1977; Lyon and Koehler\n1996; Sullivan 2019). The likelihood ratio (discussed in\n Section 2)\n is the probability of observing the evidence given the\nprosecutor\u2019s or plaintiff\u2019s hypothesis, divided by the\nprobability of observing the same evidence given the defense\u2019s\nhypothesis.\n\nLet \\(E\\) be the evidence, \\(H\\) the prosecutor\u2019s or\nplaintiff\u2019s hypothesis, and \\(H'\\) the defense\u2019s\nhypothesis. The likelihood ratio is defined as follows: \n\n\\[\nLR(E,H,H')  = \\frac{P(E\\pmid H)}{P(E\\pmid H')}\\]\n\n\nOn the likelihood ratio interpretation, relevance depends on the\nchoice of the competing hypotheses. A piece of evidence is\nrelevant\u2014in relation to a pair of hypotheses \\(H\\) and\n\\(H'\\)\u2014provided the likelihood ratio \\(LR(E, H, H')\\) is\ndifferent from one and irrelevant otherwise. For example, the bloody\nknife found in the suspect\u2019s home is relevant evidence in favor\nof the prosecutor\u2019s hypothesis because we think it is far more\nlikely to find such evidence if the suspect committed the crime\n(prosecutor\u2019s hypothesis) than if he didn\u2019t (defense\nhypothesis) (Finkelstein 2009). In general, for values greater than\none, \\(LR(E, H, H')>1\\), the evidence supports the\nprosecutor\u2019s or plaintiff\u2019s hypothesis \\(H\\), and for\nvalues below one, \\(LR(E, H, H')<1\\), the evidence supports the\ndefense\u2019s hypothesis \\(H'\\). If the evidence is equally\nlikely under either hypothesis, \\(LR(E, H, H')=1\\), the evidence\nis irrelevant.\n4.2 The Small Town Murder objection\n\nThis account of relevance has been challenged by cases in which the\nevidence is intuitively relevant and yet its likelihood ratio,\narguably, equals one. Here is one problematic case:\n\n\nSmall Town Murder: A person accused of murder in a small town\nwas seen driving to the small town at a time prior to the murder. The\nprosecution\u2019s theory is that he was driving there to commit the\nmurder. The defense theory is an alibi: he was driving to the town to\nvisit his mother. The probability of this evidence if he is guilty\nequals that if he is innocent, and thus the likelihood ratio is 1\n\u2026 Yet, every judge in every trial courtroom of the country\nwould admit it [as relevant evidence]. (The difficulty has been\nformulated by Ronald Allen, see the discussion in Park et al.\n2010)\n\n\nCounterexamples of this sort abound. Suppose a prisoner and two guards\nhad an altercation because the prisoner refused to return a food tray.\nThe prisoner had not received a package sent to him by his family and\nkept the tray in protest. According to the defense, the prisoner was\nattacked by the guards, but according to the prosecution, he attacked\nthe guards. The information about the package sent to the prisoner and\nthe withholding of the tray fails to favor either version of the\nfacts, yet it is relevant evidence (Pardo 2013).\n\nIt is true that if a piece of evidence \\(E\\) fits equally well with\ntwo competing hypotheses \\(H\\) and \\(H'\\), then \\(P(E\\pmid\nH)=P(E\\pmid H')\\) and thus \\(LR(E,H,H')\\) will equal 1. But\nthe likelihood ratio may change depending on the selection of\nhypotheses. Rule 401 makes clear that relevant evidence should have\n\n\n\nany tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of\nconsequence [emphasis ours] to the determination of the action\nmore probable or less probable. \n\n\nSo the range of hypotheses to compare should be broad. Just because\nthe likelihood ratio equals one for a specific selection of \\(H\\) and\n\\(H'\\), it does not follow that it equals one for any\nselection of \\(H\\) and \\(H'\\) which are of consequence to the\ndetermination of what happened. In Small Town Murder, whether\nthe suspect was in town is of consequence for determining what\nhappened (if he was not in town, he could not have committed the\ncrime). The fact that he was seen driving is helpful information for\nestablishing whether he was in town.\n\nBut if the range of hypotheses \\(H\\) and \\(H'\\) to compare in the\nlikelihood ratio \\(LR(E, H, H')\\) is broad, this may raise another\nconcern. The choice of hypotheses needed to determine the relevance of\nan item of evidence might depend on other items of evidence, and so it\nmight be difficult to determine relevance until one has heard all the\nevidence. This fact\u2014Ronald Allen and Samuel Gross argue in Park\net al. (2010)\u2014makes the probabilistic account of relevance\nimpractical. In response, David Kaye points out that deciding whether\na reasonable juror would find evidence \\(E\\) helpful requires only\nlooking at what hypotheses or stories the juror would reasonably\nconsider. Since the jurors will rely on several clues about which\nstories are reasonable, this task is computationally easier than going\nover all possible combinations of hypotheses (Park et al. 2010).\n\nThe problem with the paradoxes of relevance is that in complex\nsituations there is no single likelihood ratio that corresponds to a\npiece of evidence. The problematic cases focus on a single likelihood\nratio based on non-exclusive or non-exhaustive hypotheses. However,\nevidence can be relevant so long as it has a probabilistic impact on a\npertinent sub-hypothesis, even without having a probabilistic impact\non the prosecutor\u2019s or defense\u2019s ultimate hypotheses. When\nthis happens, the evidence is relevant, in agreement with Rule 401 of\nthe Federal Rules of Evidence. Bayesian networks (discussed in the\npreceding section) help to see how pieces of evidence can increase or\ndecrease the probability of different sub-hypotheses (for more\ndetails, see de Zoete et al. 2019).\n5. Standards of Proof\n\nAfter the evidence has been presented, examined and cross-examined at\ntrial, trained judges or lay jurors must reach a decision (see Laudan\n2010 for a few caveats on what the decision should be about). The\ndecision criterion is defined by law and consists of a standard of\nproof, also called the burden of persuasion. If the evidence against\nthe defendant is sufficiently strong to meet the requisite proof\nstandard, the defendant should be found liable. This section begins\nwith a description of standards of proof in the law, then outlines a\nprobabilistic account of standards of proof, and discusses\nsome objections to this account.\n5.1 Legal background\n\nIn criminal proceedings, the governing standard is \u201cproof beyond\na reasonable doubt\u201d. In civil cases, the standard is typically\n\u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d. The latter is less\ndemanding than the former, so the same body of evidence may be enough\nto meet the preponderance standard, but not enough to meet the beyond\na reasonable doubt standard. A vivid example of this difference is the\n1995 trial of O.J. Simpson who was charged with murdering his wife. He\nwas acquitted of the criminal charges, but when the family of the\nvictim brought a lawsuit against him, they prevailed. O.J. Simpson did\nnot kill his wife according to the beyond a reasonable doubt standard,\nbut he did according to the preponderance standard. An intermediate\nstandard, called \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d, is\nsometimes used for civil proceedings in which the decision is\nparticularly weighty, for example, a decision whether someone should\nbe involuntarily committed to a hospital facility.\n\nHow to define standards of proof, or whether they should be even\ndefined in the first place, remains contentious (Diamond 1990;\nHorowitz and Kirkpatrick 1996; Laudan 2006; Newman 1993; Walen\n2015). Judicial opinions offer different paraphrases, sometimes\nconflicting, of what these standards mean. The meaning of \u201cproof\nbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d is the most controversial. It has\nbeen equated to \u201cmoral certainty\u201d or \u201cabiding\nconviction\u201d (Commonwealth v. Webster, 59\nMass. 295, 1850), or to \n\n\nproof of such a convincing character that a reasonable person would\nnot hesitate to rely and act upon it in the most important of his own\naffairs. (US Federal Jury Practice and Instructions, Devitt et al. 1987, 12.10, 354)\n\n\n\nBut courts have also cautioned that there is no need to define the\nterm because \u201cjurors know what is reasonable and are quite\nfamiliar with the meaning of doubt\u201d and attempts to define it\nonly \u201cmuddy the water\u201d (U.S. v.\nGlass, 846 F.2d 386, 1988).\n\nProbability theory can bring conceptual clarity to an otherwise\nheterogeneous legal doctrine, or at least this is the position of\nlegal probabilists.\n5.2 Probability thresholds\n\nLegal probabilists have proposed to interpret proof beyond a\nreasonable doubt as the requirement that the defendant\u2019s\nprobability of guilt, given the evidence presented at trial, meet a\nthreshold, say, \\(>\\).95. Variations of this view are common (see,\nfor example, Bernoulli 1713; DeKay 1996; Kaplan 1968; Kaye 1979b;\nLaplace 1814; Laudan 2006). This interpretation is, in some respects,\nplausible. From a legal standpoint, the requirement that guilt be\nestablished with high probability, still short of 1, accords with the\nprinciple that proof beyond a reasonable doubt is the most stringent\nstandard of all but \u201cdoes not involve proof to an absolute\ncertainty\u201d and thus \u201cit is not proof beyond any\ndoubt\u201d (R. v. Lifchus, 1997, 3 SCR 320,\n335).\n\nReliance on probabilistic ideas is even more explicit in the standard\n\u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d\u2014also called\n\u201cbalance of probabilities\u201d\u2014which governs decisions\nin civil disputes. This standard can be interpreted as the requirement\nthat the plaintiff\u2014the party making the complaint against the\ndefendant\u2014establish its version of the facts with greater than\nprobability of .5. The .5 threshold, as opposed to a more stringent\nthreshold of .95 for criminal cases, reflects the fact that\npreponderance is less demanding than proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\nThe intermediate standard \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d\nis more stringent than the preponderance standard but not as stringent\nas the beyond a reasonable doubt standard. Since it lies in between\nthe other two, it can be interpreted as the requirement that the\nplaintiff establish its versions of the facts with, say, probability\nat the level of .75-.8.\n\nSome worry that a mechanical application of numerical thresholds would\nundermine the humanizing function of trial decision-making. As Tribe\nput it, \n\n\ninduced by the persuasive force of formulas and the precision of\ndecimal points to perceive themselves as performing a largely\nmechanical and automatic role, few jurors \u2026could be relied upon\nto recall, let alone to perform, [their] humanizing function. (1971:\n1376) \n\n\nThresholds, however, can vary depending on the costs and benefits at\nstake in each case (see later discussion). So they need not be applied\nmechanically without considering the individual circumstances (Hedden\nand Colyvan 2019). Furthermore, if jurors are numerically literate,\nthey should not lose sight of their humanizing function as they would\nno longer be intimated by numbers. So the worry suggests the need to\nensure that jurors are numerically literate, not dispensing with\nprobabilistic thresholds altogether.\n\nEven if numerical thresholds cannot be used in the daily business of\ntrial proceedings, they can still serve as theoretical concepts for\nunderstanding the role of proof standards in the justice system, such\nas regulating the relative frequency of false positive and false\nnegative decisions or minimizing expected costs. A more stringent\nthreshold will decrease the number of false positives (say false\nconvictions) at the cost of increasing the number of false negatives\n(say false acquittals), and a less stringent threshold will increase\nthe number of false positives while decreasing the number of false\nnegatives. This trade-off has been described, among others, by Justice\nHarlan in his concurring opinion in re Winship,\n397 U.S. 358, 397 (1970). As shown below, the formal apparatus\nof probability theory, in combination with expected utility theory,\ncan make this point more precise.\n5.3 Minimizing expected costs\n\nExpected utility theory recommends agents to take the course of action\nthat, among the available alternatives, maximizes expected utility. On\nthis view, the standard of proof is met whenever the expected utility\n(or cost) of a decision against the defendant (say, a conviction) is\ngreater (or lower) than the expected utility (or cost) of a decision\nin favor of the defendant (say, an acquittal) (DeKay 1996; Hamer 2004;\nKaplan 1968). Let \\(c(CI)\\) be the cost of convicting a factually\ninnocent defendant and \\(c(AG)\\) the cost of acquitting a factually\nguilty defendant. For a conviction to be justified, the expected cost\nof convicting an innocent\u2014that is, \\(c(CI)\\) discounted by the\nprobability of innocence \\([1-\\Pr(G\\pmid E)]\\)\u2014must be lower\nthan the expected cost of acquitting a guilty defendant\u2014that is,\n\\(c(AG)\\) discounted by the probability of guilt \\(\\Pr(G\\pmid E)\\).\nThis holds just in case  \n\n\\[\\frac{\\Pr(G\\pmid E)}{1- \\Pr(G\\pmid E)} > \\frac{c(CI)}{c(AG)}.\\]\n\nThis inequality serves to identify the probability threshold that should be met for decisions against the defendant. When the\ncost ratio \\(\\slashfrac{c(CI)}{c(AG)}\\) is set to 9\u2014which\nmight be appropriate in a criminal case since convicting an innocent\nis often considered more harmful than acquitting a guilty defendant\n(however, see Laudan 2016)\u2014the inequality holds only if \\(\\Pr(G\n\\pmid E)\\) meets the .9 threshold. The same analysis mutatis\nmutandis applies to civil cases in which mistaken decisions\ncomprise mistaken attributions of liability (false positives) and\nmistaken failures to attribute liability (false negatives). If the\ncost ratio is one\u2014as might be appropriate in a civil case in\nwhich false positives and false negatives are equally\nharmful\u2014the inequality holds only if the probability that the\ndefendant is liable meets the .5 threshold.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8 [An\n extended description of figure 8\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nThis analysis only considers the costs of mistaken decisions, but\nleaves out the benefits associated with correct decisions. More\ncomprehensive analyses would consider both (Lillquist 2002; Laudan and Saunders 2009), but the basic insight\nwould remain the same. Trial decision-making is viewed as one\ninstrument among others for maximizing overall social welfare (Posner\n1973). On this account of proof standards, the stringency of the\nthreshold depends on costs and benefits, and thus different cases may\nrequire different thresholds. Cases in which the charge is more\nserious than others\u2014say, murder compared to petty\ntheft\u2014may require higher thresholds so long as the cost of a\nmistaken decision against the defendant is more significant. Whether\nor not standards of proof should vary in this way is debated (Kaplow\n2012; Picinali 2013; see also the entry on\n the legal concept of evidence).\n\nThe standard \u201cproof beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d is often\npaired with the Blackstone ratio, the principle that it is better that\nten guilty defendants go free rather than even just one innocent be\nconvicted. The exact ratio is in fact a matter of controversy (Volokh\n1997). It is tempting to think that, say, the .9 threshold guarantees\na 1:9 ratio between false convictions and false acquittals. But this\nwould be hasty for at least two reasons. First, probabilistic\nthresholds affect the expected rate of mistaken decisions. The actual\nrate may deviate from its expected value (Kaye 1999). Second, if the\nthreshold is .9, at most 10% of decision against defendants\nare expected to be mistaken (false convictions) and at most\n90% of the decisions in favor of the defendant are expected to be\nmistaken (false acquittals). The exact ratio will depend on the\nprobabilities assigned to defendants and how they are distributed\n(Allen 2014). What can be said, in general, is that the threshold that\nminimizes the expected rate of incorrect decisions overall, no matter\nthe underlying distribution, lies at .5 (see Kaye 1982, 1999; Cheng\n& Pardo 2015 for a proof).\n5.4 Alternatives to probabilistic thresholds\n\nThere exist several theoretical alternatives to the probabilistic\ninterpretation of proof standards in the scholarly literature.\nPennington and Hastie (1991, 1993) have proposed the story\nmodel according to which judges and jurors first make sense of\nthe evidence by constructing stories of what happened, and then select\nthe best story on the basis of multiple criteria, such as coherence,\nfit with the evidence and completeness.  Pardo and Allen (2008) argue\nthat the version of the facts that best explains the evidence should\nprevail in a court of law. On the role of coherence and story\nconstruction in evidence assessment and decision-making at trial, see\n(Amaya 2015; Griffin 2013; Simon 2004).\n \n\nAnother approach is due to Gordon, Prakken, and Walton (2007) and\nPrakken and Sartor (2009) who view the trial as a place in which\narguments and counterarguments confront one another. The party that\nhas the best arguments, all things considered, should prevail. On this\nview, probability estimates can themselves be the target of objections\nand counterarguments. Along these lines, Stein (2008) argues that, in\norder to warrant a verdict against the defendant, the evidence should have survived individualized scrutiny, not merely support a high probability of liability.\n\nPhilosophers and legal theorists have also leveled distinctively\nepistemological critiques. Ho (2008) and Haack (2014) hold that\ndegrees of epistemic warrant for a claim, which depend on multiple\nfactors\u2014such as the extent to which the evidence supports the\nclaim and it is comprehensive\u2014cannot be equated to\nprobabilities. Gardiner (2019) argues that standards of proof should\nrule out all error possibilities that are relevant and these need not\ncoincide with error possibilities that are probable. Finally, some\nepistemologists argue that a belief that is assigned high probability, no matter how high,\nis not enough to warrant knowledge, and knowledge should be the\nstandard for trial verdicts (Blome-Tillmann 2017; Duff et al. 2007; Levanon 2019; Littlejohn 2020; Moss\nforthcoming).\n\nScholars and commentators have also voiced more specific objections\nthat need not invalidate the probabilistic framework but rather call\nfor refinements. Nance (2016) argues that the evidence on which to\nbase a trial decision should be reasonably complete\u2014it should be\nall the evidence that one would reasonably expect to see from a\nconscientious investigation of the facts. A similar argument can be\nfound in Davidson and Pargetter (1987). Arguably, probability-based\ndecision thresholds can accommodate these considerations, for example,\nby lowering the probability of civil or criminal liability whenever\nthe body of evidence is one-sided or incomplete (Friedman 1996;\nKaye 1979c, 1986). Another strategy is to give a probability-based\naccount of the notion of completeness of the evidence and other\nseemingly non-probabilistic criteria (Urbaniak 2018).\n\nThere are a plethora of other objections. The puzzles of naked\nstatistical evidence and the conjunction paradox are two of the most\nwidely debated in the literature. These and other objections are\nexamined in the sections that follow.\n6. Naked Statistical Evidence\n\nThe puzzles of naked statistical evidence consist of hypothetical\nscenarios in which the probability of the defendant\u2019s civil or\ncriminal liability, given the evidence, is above the requisite\nthreshold. Yet many have the intuition that the defendant should not\nbe found liable. The question is how to justify this intuition despite\nthe fact that the probability of liability meets the threshold. The\npuzzles of naked statistical evidence concern the question of\nsufficiency, namely, whether a body of evidence is enough to\nmeet the proof standard applicable in a case. They are not about\nwhether some evidence should be admissible at trial (on the\ndistinction, see Picinali 2016).\n6.1 Blue Bus, Gatecrasher, Prisoner\n\n\nBlue Bus (Tribe 1971). Mrs. Brown is run down by a bus. It is\ncommon knowledge that 80% of the buses in town are owned by Blue Bus,\nand the remaining 20% by Red Bus. There was no witness to the accident\nexcept Brown who is, however, color-blind. Since Blue Bus owns 80% of\nthe buses in town, it is 80% likely that Brown was run down by a bus\noperated by Blue Bus, well above the 50% threshold for civil\nliability. Yet, merely presenting the 80% naked statistics should not\nbe sufficient for Brown to prevail in a civil lawsuit against Blue\nBus.\n\nGatecrasher (Cohen 1977). It is known that 499 people paid\nfor admission to a rodeo, but the total number of spectators was 1000.\nSuppose no paper tickets were issued and no witness could identify\nthose who paid. For any spectator picked at random, it is more than\n50% likely that they did not pay for admission. But even if this\nprobability is above the .5 threshold for civil liability, it would be\nodd that the rodeo organizers could win a lawsuit against any of the\nspectators simply by presenting the 449-out-of-1000 naked statistics.\n\nPrisoner (Nesson 1979). 100 prisoners are exercising in a\nprison yard. Suddenly 99 of them attack and kill the only guard on\nduty. One prisoner played no role whatsoever in the assault. These are\nthe undisputed facts in the case, and there is no further information\nabout what happened. If a prisoner is picked at random, his\nprobability of guilt would be as high as .99. Yet the intuition is\nthat this cannot be enough to establish guilt beyond a reasonable\ndoubt.\n\n\nThese scenarios are like lottery cases in which the probability of a\nproposition such as \u201cmy ticket is a loser\u201d is high, yet\nintuitively the proposition cannot count as knowledge (see, e.g.,\nHarman 1968; Ebert, Smith, and Durbach 2018; Hawthorne 2004; Lawlor\n2013; Nelkin 2000). The evidence in these scenarios\u2014in\nparticular, Gatecrasher and Prisoner\u2014does not\nsingle out an individual specifically, but applies to any member of a\ngroup. Just as in lottery cases any ticket is very likely to lose,\nanyone who attended the rodeo or any prisoner in the yard is very\nlikely to be liable. In this sense, naked statistical evidence is\nsometimes contrasted with individualized or case-specific evidence\nsuch as trace evidence or eyewitness testimony (Colyvan, Regan, and\nFerson 2001; Stein 2005; Thomson 1986; Williams 1979). The distinction is\ncontested, however. Any form of evidence, after all, relies on a\ncategorization that places the defendant in a class with others, being\nthe class of those who have such-and-such facial features or were in\nsuch-and-such a place (Harcourt 2006; Saks and Kidd 1980; Schauer\n2003; Schoeman 1987; Wright 1988). Tillers (1997, 2005) notes that it\nis not always objectionable to base inferences about the behavior of\nan individual on the behavior of others, for example, membership in a\ngang or in the Ku Klux Klan can be indicative of someone\u2019s\nbeliefs.\n\nStill, there is intuitive resistance against verdicts of liability\nbased on naked statistics, but this resistance is less pronounced for\nverdicts based on more traditional forms of evidence, such as trace or\neyewitness testimony. The asymmetry might just be an artifact of\nhistory, since the testimony of an honest witness has been the bedrock\nof the Anglo-American trial system. However, the resistance toward\nnaked statistical evidence along with the preference for other forms\nof evidence has also been verified empirically (Arkes,\nShoots-Reinhard, and Mayes 2012; Niedermeier, Kerr, and\nMess\u00e9 1999; Wells 1992) and is not limited to the legal context\n(Ebert et al. 2018; Friedman and Turri 2015; Sykes and Johnson\n1999).\n\nSome scholars have expressed reservations about the relevance of\nhypothetical scenarios featuring naked statistical evidence. Since\nthese scenarios are removed from trial practice, they might be an\nunreliable guide for theorizing about the trial (Allen and Leiter\n2001; Dant 1988; Schmalbeck 1986). These scenarios, however, are\npartly modeled on real cases. For example, Blue Bus is\nmodeled on Smith v. Rapid Transit, Inc. 317\nMas. 469 (1945). The hypothetical also bears a similarity with\nthe landmark case Sindell v. Abbott\nLaboratories, 26 Cal. 3d 588 (1980) in which different\ncompanies marketed the same drug that was later shown to have caused\ncancer to a particular individual. Since the drug was sold by multiple\ncompanies, it was impossible to determine which company was\nresponsible. Statistics about the market share of the two companies\nwere used to attribute liability in absence of better, more\nindividualized evidence.\n6.2 Cold-hits\n\nLegal scholars have drawn parallels between naked statistical evidence\nand DNA evidence in cold-hit cases (Roth 2010). The peculiarity of\ncold-hit cases is that the defendant is identified through a database\nsearch of several different genetic profiles, and as a consequence,\nthe evidence in cold-hit cases consists almost exclusively of a DNA\nmatch between the crime traces and the defendant (see earlier\ndiscussion in\n \u00a72.2).\n The match\u2014as is customary\u2014is complemented by a\nstatistical estimate of the frequency of the profile, say, one in one\nhundred million people share the same matching profile. Given the\nlargely statistical nature of the evidence, cold-hit cases can be seen\nas realistic examples of scenarios such as Prisoner or\nGatecrasher. But whether we should think about cold-hit cases\nin this way is contested. Some authors place naked statistical\nevidence and cold-hit matches on a par (Smith 2018) and others do not\n(Enoch and Fisher 2015; Enoch, Spectre, and Fisher 2012).\n\nSome appellate courts in the United States have ruled that cold-hit\nmatches, even though they are uncorroborated by other evidence,\nconstitute sufficient ground for verdicts of criminal liability\n(Malcom 2008). Judge Hardwick, for example, writes that\n\n if DNA material is found in a location, quantity, and type inconsistent\nwith casual contact and there is one in one quintillion likelihood\nthat some else was the source of the material, the evidence is legally\nsufficient to support a guilty verdict. Missouri v.\u2006Abdelmalik,\n273 S.W.3d, 61, 66 (Mo. Ct. App. 2008) \n\n\nSuch pronouncements by appellate court lend support to the view that\nthe statistics underlying cold-hit DNA matches are unlike naked\nstatistical evidence (Cheng and Nunn 2016; Di Bello 2019).\n6.3 Revisionist responses\n\nThe puzzles of naked naked statistical evidence are some of the most\ndifficult for legal probabilism. They directly challenge the claim\nthat a high probability should suffice for a judgment of criminal or\ncivil liability. One line of response that legal probabilists can\npursue is to recommend revising our intuitions in hypothetical cases\nand questioning their relevance as a guide for theorizing about\nstandards of proof. Legal probabilists can argue that the preference\nfor traditional forms of evidence over statistical evidence is an\nunwarranted bias (Laudan 2006; Papineau forthcoming). They can point\nout that research in psychology and cognitive science has shown that\neyewitness testimony and fingerprint evidence are often unreliable\n(Simons and Chabris 1999), prone to manipulation (Loftus 1979\n[1996]), and influenced by subjective considerations and matters of\ncontext (Dror, Charlton, and P\u00e9ron 2006; Zabell 2005).\nRelying on statistical evidence, on the other hand, should improve the\noverall accuracy of trial decisions (Koehler and Shaviro 1990).\nLegal probabilists can also argue that the puzzles of naked\nstatistical evidence are confined to hypotheticals, and our judgments\nabout statistical evidence may well differ in more realistic cases\n(Hedden and Colyvan 2019; Ross 2021).\n\nFew have defended such revisionist views, however. The literature\nhas predominantly tried to vindicate the intuitive difference between\nnaked statistical evidence and other forms of evidence. What follows\nis a discussion of some of the proposals in the literature, focusing\nspecifically on the probabilistic ones. An examination of the\nnon-probabilistic solutions to the paradoxes of naked statistical\nevidence falls outside the scope of this entry (for critical surveys,\nsee Redmayne 2008; Gardiner 2018; Pardo 2019).\n6.4 Non-revisionist responses\n\nBelow are six non-revisionist moves legal probabilists can make in\nresponse to the paradoxes of naked statistical evidence.\n\nFirst, legal probabilists can deny that in scenarios such as\nGatecrasher the probability of liability is high enough to\nmeet the required threshold. Kaye (1979a) argues that whenever there\nis no other evidence besides naked statistical evidence, this is not\nenough for the plaintiff to win because the evidence is suspiciously\nthin. This circumstance should lead the fact-finders to lower the\nprobability of liability below the requisite threshold. Along similar\nlines, Nance (2016) argues that when the evidence presented at trial\nis incomplete\u2014that is, evidence that one would reasonably expect\nto see at trial is missing\u2014the defendant should not be found\nliable. This strategy  might work in\nscenarios such as Blue Bus in which the paucity of the\nevidence could well be the plaintiff\u2019s fault. But the difficulty is, it is unclear\nwhether this strategy works for scenarios such as Gatecrasher\nor Prisoner in which the paucity of the evidence is a\ncharacteristic of the scenarios themselves, not anyone\u2019s\nfault.\n\nSecond, legal probabilists can appeal to the reference class problem\n(Colyvan, Regan, and Ferson 2001; see also later \n Section 7). An individual may fall under different\nreference classes. If 3% of those who smoke have lung cancer and 0.1%\nof those who exercise regularly have lung cancer, what about someone\nwho smokes and exercises regularly? In Gatecrasher, it is\narbitrary to single out the group of people at the stadium and not the\ngroup of people with a history of trespassing. There is no clear\nreason why one or the other reference class was chosen. The choice of\nanother reference class could have led to a different conclusion about\nthe defendant\u2019s probability of liability. This approach has also\nbeen endorsed by scholars who are decidedly opposed to legal\nprobabilism (Allen and Pardo 2007). Critics of this approach note\nthat the reference class problem affects any evidence-based judgment.\nIn assessing the strength of any piece of evidence, different\nreference classes can be used, say the class of witnesses who give\ndetailed descriptions of what they saw or the class of witnesses who\nare nervous (Redmayne 2008).\n\nThird, legal probabilists can observe that probabilistic claims based\non naked statistical evidence are not resilient enough against\npossible countervailing evidence (on the notion of resilience and\nstability of belief, see Skyrms 1980; Leitgeb 2014). If an eyewitness\nwere to assert that the prisoner did not participate in the riot, the\nprobability that he would be guilty of killing the guard should be\nlowered significantly. Presumably, trial verdicts cannot be so\nvolatile. They should aim to some degree of stability even in light of\npossible further evidence (Bolinger 2021). A problem with this\napproach is that more evidence could always be found that would change\none\u2019s probabilistic assessment. A further problem is that the\npuzzles of naked statistical evidence are cases in which no further\nevidence is\u2014or could possibly be\u2014available. But adding the\nassurance that the probabilistic claims could not be revised does not\nmake the naked statistics less problematic.\n\nFourth, legal probabilists can insist that verdicts solely based on\nnaked statistics do not promote the goal of expected utility\nmaximization. This is not so much because the naked statistics are bad\nevidence, but rather, because reliance on them may have a number of\nunintended costs, such as suboptimal allocation of the burden of error\nor lack of deterrence. In Blue Bus, for example, a verdict\nagainst the company with the largest market share might create a\nperverse economic incentive against larger companies (Posner 1973). It\nis unclear how this explanation could be extended to other cases such\nas Gatecrasher or Prisoner, and there are even\nvariants of Blue Bus not susceptible to this objection (Wells\n1992). Alternatively, Dahlman (2020) argues that verdicts based on\nnaked statistical evidence do not provide any added incentive for\nlawful conduct because they would not make a distinction between\nlawful and unlawful behavior. (On deterrence and naked statistics, see\nalso Enoch, Spectre, and Fisher 2012; Enoch and Fisher 2015).\n\n\nFifth, another line of response for legal probabilists is to concede\nthat the paradoxes of naked statistical evidence demonstrate the\ninadequacy of simple probabilistic thresholds as proof standards\n(Urbaniak 2019). Instead of the posterior probability of liability, a\nnumber of scholars have focused on the likelihood ratio \\(P(E\\pmid\nH)/P(E \\pmid H')\\). Their argument is that, even though naked\nstatistical evidence can support a high posterior probability of\nliability, the likelihood ratio of this evidence equals one because it\ncould be presented against a defendant no matter what the defendant\ndid. If so, naked statistical evidence should have no evidential value\n(Cheng 2012; Sullivan 2019). However, Dahlman (2020) has criticized\nthis argument noting that, under plausible assumptions, the likelihood\nratio of naked statistical evidence is significantly greater than one.\n Di Bello (2019) argues that in cases such as Prisoner and\nGatecrasher the likelihood ratio could take a range of\ndifferent values depending on the background information that is taken\ninto account. The likelihood ratio of naked statistical evidence in\nthose scenarios is therefore neither one nor greater than one, but\nstrictly speaking unknown (for a critique of this argument, see\nUrbaniak et al. 2020).\nFinally, legal probabilists can reformulate probabilistic standards\nof proof using the concept of knowledge. Moss (2018) argues that a\nprobabilistic belief, just like a full belief, can constitute\nknowledge.  This notion of probabilistic knowledge can be used to\nformulate an account of standards of proof for trial decisions (Moss,\n2018: ch. 10; Moss, forthcoming). The preponderance standard for civil\ncases would be met if, based on the evidence presented at trial,\njudges or jurors have at least .5 credence that the defendant is\nliable, and this probabilistic belief constitutes knowledge.  The\nstandard in criminal cases\u2014proof beyond a reasonable\ndoubt\u2014would instead require knowledge of the probabilistic\nbelief that the defendant is extremely likely to be guilty or simply\nfull-fledged knowledge of guilt. To the extent that naked statistical\nevidence does not warrant full-fledged knowledge or probabilistic\nknowledge, knowledge-based accounts offer a solution to the puzzles of\nnaked statistical evidence. In addition, the probabilistic knowledge\naccount of standards of proof promises to vindicate the intuition that\nprobability alone is not enough for legal proof while also\nacknowledging the key role that probability plays in decision-making\nat trial (however, for a critique of knowledge-based accounts of legal\nproof from a legal standpoint, see Allen 2021).\n\n\n7. Further Objections\n\nAside from the paradoxes of naked statistical evidence, the\nconjunction paradox is one of the most widely discussed objections\nagainst legal probabilism. This section examines this paradox together\nwith a few other objections. Many of these objections can be traced\nback to the seminal work of Cohen (1977) who also leveled criticisms\nagainst Bayesian epistemology more generally (for further discussion,\nsee Earman 1992; Bovens and Hartmann 2004; Bradley 2015 and the\nentry on\n Bayesian epistemology).\n7.1 The difficulty about conjunction\n\nSuppose the plaintiff is to prove two separate claims, \\(A\\) and\n\\(B\\), according to the governing standard of proof, say,\npreponderance of the evidence (which the legal probabilist may\ninterpret as the requirement that the facts be established with\ngreater probability than .5). If the plaintiff has proven each claim\nwith probability .7, the burden of proof should be met. And yet, if\nthe two claims are independent, the probability of their conjunction\nis only \\(.7\\times.7=.49\\), below the required threshold. Arguably,\ncommon law systems subscribe to a conjunction principle which states\nthat if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are established according to the governing\nstandard of proof, so is their conjunction. Probability theory\u2014the\ncriticism goes\u2014cannot capture this principle. This is the so-called\nconjunction paradox or difficulty about conjunction. It was originally\nformulated by Cohen (1977) and has enjoyed great popularity every\nsince (Allen 1986; Allen and Stein 2013; Allen and Pardo 2019;\nHaack 2014; Schwartz and Sober 2017; Stein 2005).\n\nWithout rejecting the conjunction principle of the common law, legal\nprobabilists can respond in a few different ways. Dawid (1987) argues\nthat the difficulty about conjunction disappears if evidential support\nis modeled probabilistically by likelihood ratios instead of posterior\nprobabilities. He writes that \n\n\nsuitably measured, the support supplied by the conjunction of several\nindependent testimonies exceeds that supplied by any of its\nconstituents. \n\n\nAlthough the original paradox pertains to posterior probabilities of\nliability, Dawid argues that the paradox does not arise for likelihood\nratios. Garbolino (2014) also recommends switching to likelihood\nratios. Yet the conjunction paradox still arises for likelihood ratios\nwhen the items of evidence, say \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), are assessed relative\nto a composite hypothesis, say \\(A \\wedge B\\). Suppose \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)\nprovide positive support for \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), respectively. Urbaniak\n(2019) shows that the combined likelihood ratio \n\n\\[\\frac{\\Pr(a \\wedge b \\pmid  A\\wedge B)}{\\Pr(a\\wedge b \\pmid  \\neg (A \\wedge B))}\\]\n\n\ncan be lower than the individual likelihood ratios  \n\n\\[\\frac{\\Pr(a \\pmid  A)}{\\Pr(a \\pmid  \\neg A)}\\]\n\n\nand \n\n \\[\\frac{\\Pr(b \\pmid  B)}{\\Pr(b \\pmid  \\neg B)}.\\]\n\n\nCheng (2012) provides another probability-based solution to the\nconjunction paradox. He argues that the standard of proof in civil\ncases should require that the plaintiff\u2019s hypothesis be\ncomparatively more probable on the evidence than the defendant\u2019s\nhypothesis. On this account, the probability of \\(A\\wedge B\\) given\nthe overall evidence in a case should be compared with the probability\nof the alternative hypotheses given the same evidence. The\nalternatives to be considered are as follows: \n\n\\(A\\wedge \\neg B\\), \n\\(\\neg A \\wedge B\\), and \n\\(\\neg A \\wedge \\neg B\\).\n\n\nGiven suitable assumptions, the probabilities of these alternatives\nwill fall below the probability of \\(A\\wedge B\\) provided \\(A\\) and\n\\(B\\), individually, are supported by the evidence. So whenever the\nstandard of proof is met for individual claims \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), the\nstandard should also be met for the composite claim \\(A \\wedge B\\).\nKaplow (2014) advances a similar argument. Urbaniak (2019) points out\nthat Cheng splits the defense hypothesis into three sub-cases,\n\\(A\\wedge \\neg B\\), \\(\\neg A \\wedge B\\), and \\(\\neg A \\wedge \\neg B\\),\nbut does not consider the alternative \\(\\neg (A \\wedge B)\\). The\nprobability of \\(\\neg (A \\wedge B)\\) may actually exceed that of\n\\(A\\wedge B\\). If \\(\\neg (A \\wedge B)\\) is the alternative hypothesis,\nthe standard might not be met for the composite claim \\(A \\wedge B\\),\neven when the standard is met for individual claims \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)\n(for another critique of Cheng\u2019s approach, see Allen & Stein\n2013).\n\nFinally, legal probabilists can pursue a holistic approach in response\nto the conjunction paradox. This solution has been defended by\nopponents of legal probabilism (Allen 1986; Allen and Pardo 2019), but\ncan also be adopted by legal probabilists. Instead of assessing the\nposterior probabilities of individual claims given individual pieces\nof evidence, the holistic approach recommends assessing the\nprobability of the overall composite claim, say \\(A \\wedge B\\), in\nlight of all the evidence available (Hedden and Colyvan, 2019; see\nhowever the response by Allen 2020). Bayesian networks (see earlier\ndiscussion in Section 3) can help\nto assess the evidence holistically (de Zoete, Sjerps, and Meester\n2017; de Zoete and Sjerps 2018; Neil et al. 2019).\n7.2 Cohen\u2019s other objections\n\nCohen (1977) leveled a few other objections against legal probabilism.\nThey are less well-known than the paradoxes of naked statistical\nevidence or the conjunction paradox, but are still worth\nexamining.\n7.2.1 Completeness\n\nThe statement \\(\\Pr(\\neg H\\pmid E) = 1-\\Pr(H\\pmid E)\\) is a theorem of\nthe probability calculus. If the probability of \\(H\\) given \\(E\\) is\nlow, the probability of \\(\\neg H\\) given the same evidence must be\nhigh. This fact may seem to create evidence from ignorance. If \\(E\\)\nis meager evidence of \\(H\\) (that is, \\(\\Pr(H \\pmid E)\\) is low), it\nmust be strong evidence for the negation of \\(H\\) (that is, \\(\\Pr(\\neg\nH \\pmid E)\\) is high). This seems wrong. Intuitively, some evidence\ncan weakly support both a hypothesis and its negation. For example,\nsuppose one has heard a rumor that the defendant spent the night at\nthe bar when the crime was committed. The rumor is weak evidence for\nthe claim that the defendant spent the night at the bar. It does not\nfollow that the rumor is strong evidence that the defendant did\nnot spend the night at the bar. Evidence may actually have no\nbearing whatsoever on a hypothesis. Probability seems unable to\ncapture this fact, or at least this is the objection.\n\nThis difficulty motivated the development of a non-classical theory of\nprobability and evidential support by Dempster (1968) and Shafer\n(1976). Legal probabilists, however, need not reject classical\nprobability theory. They can respond that the difficulty just\ndescribed arises only because one is inclined to measure the strength\nof evidence in terms of the posterior probability \\(\\Pr(H \\pmid E)\\),\nrather than by means of the likelihood ratio (on this distinction, see\nearlier in\n Section 2).\n If \\(E\\) weakly supports \\(H\\)\u2014that is, the likeklihood ratio \n\n\\[\\frac{\\Pr(E \\pmid H)}{\\Pr(E \\pmid \\neg H)}\\]\n\n\nis barely above one\u2014it does not follow that \\(E\\) strongly\nsupports \\(\\neg H\\). In fact, it rather follows follows that \\(E\\)\nweakly disfavors \\(\\neg H\\), because \n\n\\[\\frac{\\Pr(E \\pmid \\neg H)}{\\Pr(E \\pmid H)}\\]\n\n \nwill be slightly below one.\n7.2.2 Corroboration\n\nWhen two or more independent witnesses testify to the truth of the\nsame proposition, and their stories are relatively unlikely, the\nprobability of the proposition in question should increase\nsignificantly. This phenomenon of \u201cconfidence boost\u201d is\nknown as corroboration. In case of circumstantial evidence, the\nanalogous phenomenon is called convergence. Cohen (1977) argues that\nno probabilistic measure of evidential support captures this\nphenomenon. He examines different probabilistic\nproposals\u2014Boole\u2019s formula (Boole 1857),\nEkel\u00f6f\u2019s principle (Ekel\u00f6f 1964), a formula due to\nLambert and Kruskal (1988)\u2014and finds them inadequate. He argues\nthat the confidence boost that is expected from corroboration is not\nadequately captured by any of these proposals.\n\nMore recently, better probabilistic accounts of corroboration have\nbeen developed (Fenton and Neil 2013 [2018]; Robertson, Vignaux,\nand Berger 2016; Taroni et al. 2014). A recurrent theme in this line\nof work is that corroboration can be accounted for in probabilistic\nterms by multiplying the likelihood ratios of the individual pieces of\nevidence. The thought is that the result of multiplying the likelihood\nratios of different pieces of evidence combined exceeds the likelihood\nratios associated with the individual pieces of evidence (see general\ndiscussion in Bovens and Hartmann 2004: ch. 5). Cohen, however,\ninsisted that the confidence boost due to corroboration should be\nlarge, and the large boost is not reflected as a result of multiplying\nthe likelihood ratios. What needs further exploring is the size of the\nconfidence boost and the features of the evidence that affect the\nboost. Urbaniak and Janda (2020) offer a detailed discussion of\nCohen\u2019s objections and candidates for a solution.\n7.3 The problem of priors\n\nAnother objection often leveled against legal probabilism is the\nproblem of priors. This problem emerges as one sets out to assess the\nposterior probability of a hypothesis given the available evidence,\n\\(\\Pr(H \\pmid E)\\).\n\nTo carry out the calculations, Bayes\u2019 theorem requires as a\nstarting point the prior probability of the hypothesis, \\(\\Pr(H)\\),\nirrespective of the evidence. The correct assessment of this prior\nprobability is by no means obvious. Different strategies have been\nproposed.\n\nFirst, the prior probability can be equated to \\(1/k\\) where \\(k\\) is\nthe number of alternative equiprobable hypotheses. If there are \\(k\\)\npossible hypotheses and no one is more probable than the other, it is\nnatural to assign \\(1/k\\) to each hypothesis. This approach, however,\nwould render prior probabilities quite sensitive to the choice of\nhypotheses and thus potentially arbitrary. In addition, this approach\nis particularly unsuitable for criminal cases. If two hypotheses are\n\u201cthe defendant is guilty\u201d and \u201cthe defendant is\ninnocent\u201d, the prior probability of each would be 50%.\nDefendants in criminal cases, however, should be presumed innocent\nuntil proven guilty. Prior probability of guilt at the level of .5\nseems excessive. The presumption of innocence\u2014a procedural\nprotection afforded to all defendants in many countries\u2014should\nrequire that the prior probability of guilt be set to a small value\n(Allen et al. 1995). But it is unclear how low that value\nshould be. Would .001 be sufficiently low or should it be .000001? All\nthat can be said, perhaps, is that in criminal cases the prior\nprobability of guilt should be extremely low (Friedman 2000).\n\nAlternatively, the prior probability can be equated to \\(1/n\\) where\n\\(n\\) is the number of total possible suspects or wrongdoers who could\nhave committed the crime or civil wrong under dispute at trial. This,\ntoo, is a plausible proposal. Since someone must have committed the\nwrong, absent any further evidence anyone could have committed it, so\n\\(1/n\\) is a reasonable starting point. But this proposal also quickly\nruns into difficulties. In some cases, whether a wrong was committed\nby anyone can itself be disputed. Or there might be cases in which an\nillegal act was certainly committed and the defendant took part in it,\nbut it is not clear what illegal act it was, say murder or\nmanslaughter.\n\nTo avoid some of the difficulties described above, other models\nrely on relevant background information, for example, geographical\ninformation about people\u2019s opportunities to commit crimes\n(Fenton et al. 2019). But even if these models are\nsuccessful in giving well-informed assessments of prior probabilities,\na deeper difficulty lingers. That is, any assessment of prior\nprobabilities, no matter how it is done, is likely to violate existing\nnormative requirements of the trial system (Dahlman 2017; Engel 2012;\nSchweizer 2013). If the assessment of prior probabilities relies on\ndemographic information, people who belong to certain demographic\ngroups will be regarded as having a higher prior probability of\ncommitting a wrong than others. But if some people\u2019s priors are\nhigher than other people\u2019s priors, it will be easier to convict\nor find liable those who are assigned higher priors, even if the\nevidence against them is the same as the evidence against those\nassigned lower priors. This outcome can be seen as unfair, especially\nin criminal cases, since it exposes to a higher risk of conviction\nthose innocents who are assigned a higher prior probability because of\nthe demographic group they belong to (Di Bello and O\u2019Neil\n2020).\n\nPerhaps, as some have suggested, legal probabilists should do away\nwith prior probabilities and rely on likelihood ratios instead as a\nguide for trial decisions (Sullivan 2019). Another strategy for\navoiding the problem of priors is to consider an interval of values\nand see the extent to which different possible priors affect the\nposterior probability (Finkelstein and Fairley 1970), as discussed\nin\n Section 1.4.\n7.4 The reference class problem\n\nAnother challenge to legal probabilism is the reference class problem.\nThe reference class problem, originally formulated by Venn (1866),\narises because the same event may belong to multiple reference classes\nin which the frequencies of the event in question are different. A\ncommon approach, given among others by Reichenbach (1935 [1949: 374]),\nis to rely on \u201cthe narrowest class for which reliable statistics\ncan be compiled\u201d. This may work in some cases provided reliable\nstatistics are available. But what if someone belongs to different\nclasses that are equally narrow?\n\nConsider the case of Charles Shonubi, a Nigerian citizen working in\nNew Jersey, who was arrested on 10 December 1991 at JFK Airport in New\nYork for smuggling heroin into the United States. He was found\ncarrying 103 balloons in his gastrintestinal tract containing 427.4\ngrams of heroin. During the sentencing proceedings, the prosecutor\nargued that since Shonubi made seven trips between the United States\nand Nigeria prior to his arrest, he smuggled a larger total quantity\nof heroin than 427.4 grams. The prosecution offered data on amounts of\nheroin seized from 117 Nigerian drug smugglers who were arrested at\nJFK airport between 1 September 1990 and 10 December 1991. The expert\nfor the prosecutor, Dr. Boyum, calculated that it was 99% likely that\nShonubi smuggled at least 2090.2 grams in total before his final trip\n(U.S. v. Shonubi 895 F. Supp 460, E.D.N.Y.\n1995).\n\nShonubi was a member of the reference class \u201cpeople found\ncarrying heroin while traveling between Nigeria and New York\u201d\nbut also the class \u201ctoll collectors at the George Washington\nbridge\u201d. Why rely on the former and not the latter to make\ninferences about how much heroin Shonubi smuggled into the United\nStates? (Colyvan, Regan, and Ferson 2001). What follows examines the specific\ndifficulties that the reference class problem poses for legal\nprobabilism and how legal probabilists might respond.\n7.4.1 The challenge\n\nAllen and Pardo (2007) argue that the reference class problem poses\na challenge for legal probabilism and more specifically for\nprobabilistic measures of evidentiary strength such as likelihood\nratios (see earlier in\n Section 2).\n The problem is that the same piece of evidence may be assigned\ndifferent likelihood ratios depending on the reference class chosen.\nFor example, the denominator in the likelihood ratio associated with a\nDNA match is the probability of a match given that a random person,\nunrelated to the crime, is the source. This probability depends on the\nfrequency of the profile in a select population. But which reference\npopulation should one choose? Since nothing in the natural world picks\nout one reference class over another\u2014the argument goes\u2014the\nlikelihood ratio would be an arbitrary measure of evidentiary\nstrength.\n\nIt is tempting to dismiss this challenge by noting that expert\nwitnesses work with multiple reference classes and entertain plausible\nranges of values (Nance 2007). In fact, relying on multiple reference\nclasses is customary in the assessment of DNA evidence. In Darling\nv. State, 808 So. 2d 145 (Fla. 2002),\nfor example, a Polish woman living in Orlando was sexually assaulted\nand killed. The DNA expert testified about multiple random match\nprobabilities, relying on frequencies about African-Americans,\nCaucasians and Southeastern Hispanics from the Miami area. Since the\nperpetrator could have belonged to any of these ethnic groups, the\ngroups considered by the expert were all relevant under different\nscenarios of what could have happened.\n\nUnlike expert witnesses, appellate courts often prefer that only one\nreference class be considered. In another case, Michael Pizarro, who\nmatched the crime traces, was convicted of raping and suffocating his\n13-year-old-half-sister (People v. Pizarro, 110\nCal.App.4th 530, 2003). The FBI analyst testified at trial that\nthe likelihood of finding another unrelated Hispanic individual with\nthe same genetic profile was approximately \\(\\slashfrac{1}{250,000}\\).\nSince the race of the perpetrator was not known, Pizarro appealed\narguing that the DNA evidence was inadmissible. The appellate court\nsided with Pizarro and objected to the presentation of frequency\nestimates for the Hispanic population as well as frequencies for any\nother racial or ethnic groups. The court wrote: \n\n\nIt does not matter how many Hispanics, Caucasians, Blacks, or Native\nAmericans resemble the perpetrator if the perpetrator is actually\nAsian.\n\n\nThe uneasiness that appellate courts display when expert witnesses\ntestify about multiple references classes is understandable. Perhaps,\nthe reference class most favorable to the defendant should be\nselected, giving the accused the benefit of the doubt. This might be\nappropriate in some cases. But suppose the random match probability\nassociated with a DNA match is 1 in 10 for people in group A, while it\nis 1 in 100 million for people in group B. Always going for the\nreference class that is most favorable to the defendant will in some\ncases weaken the incriminating force of DNA matches more than\nnecessary.\n7.4.2 Relevance and critical questions\n\nLegal probabilists have formulated different criteria for identifying\nthe most appropriate reference class. Franklin (2011) is optimistic.\nOn his approach, the most appropriate reference class for drawing an\ninference about an event or outcome \\(B\\) is the class defined by the\nintersection of all the features that are relevant to \\(B\\). Relevance\nis measured statistically given the available data as the co-variation\nof \\(B\\) with the feature in question. Co-variation will be measured\nusing appropriate statistical criteria, such as the correlation\ncoefficient between two variables. For instance, in the Shonubi case,\nfeatures such as being Nigerian, drug courier, traveling toward JFK,\nwere all relevant for making an inference about the total amount of\ndrugs Shonubi carried. Other features for which data were available,\nsuch as being a toll collector at the George Washington Bridge, were\nnot relevant. The optimism of Franklin\u2019s approach, however, is\ndimmed by the pervasiveness of the reference class problem (for more\ndetails, see H\u00e1jek 2007).\n\nInstead of focusing on relevance only, the choice of the most\nappropriate reference class may also include a mix of statistical (or\nepistemic) criteria as well as non-epistemic criteria. Dahlman (2018)\nproposes a list of critical questions, such as: Is the reference class\nheterogeneous or homogeneous? Is it robust? Does it put people in the\nreference class at an unfair disadvantage? The first two questions are\nepistemic, but the third is not. If people in certain ethnic or\nsocio-economic groups engage in criminal acts more often than others,\nrelying on ethnic or socio-economic reference classes may heighten\nsociety\u2019s stigma and prejudice toward members of these groups.\nRelying on these reference classes should therefore be avoided, not\nbecause they are irrelevant but because they are prejudicial.\n7.4.3 Model selection\n\nThe reference class problem can be thought of as a particular case of \nthe model selection problem (Cheng 2009).  The model should capture the data to some extent, but not overfit the data. Random variation in the data should not be built\ninto the model. In statistics, different criteria for model selection\nexists, most notably the Akaike\u2019s Information Criterion (AIC),\nwhich is a popular measure of the trade-off between model\u2019s fit\nwith the data and its complexity. Consider the Shonubi case again. In\norder to predict the total amount of heroin Shonubi transported, a\nsimple linear model could be used, where each reference class\ncomes with an empirically established\nmultiplier \\(\\beta\\) for the expected total amount of drugs carried\nbased on how much drugs one carried on a single trip. Picking too\ngeneric a class (say, \u201cairline passenger\u201d) would lower the\nempirical adequacy of the model, but relying on too narrow a class\nwould incorporate random noise. A model using the class \u201ctoll\ncollector\u201d would clearly perform\n(in terms of statistical measures such as AIC) worse than, say a model\nbased on the class \u201cNigerian drug\ncourier at JFK\u201d.\n\nColyvan and Regan (2007) argue that the reference class problem is a\nform of model uncertainty. For them, the reference class problem stems from uncertainty about the particular statistical model that should be employed. Model\nuncertainty is evident in the Shonubi case as alternative models were\ndiscussed. The first model consisted in multiplying the amount which\nShonubi was found carrying when he was arrested by the number of trips\nhe made between the Nigeria and New York. Admittedly, this model was\ntoo simplistic. The expert witness for the prosecution, Dr. Boyum,\ndeveloped a second model. It was based on the DEA data and consisted\nin the simulation of 100,000 possible series of seven trips by\nre-sampling sets of seven net weights from the 117 known cases.\n\nBoyum\u2019s model was criticized by another expert in the case, Dr.\nFinkelstein, who complained that the model did not take into\nconsideration systematic differences between trips. Presumably,\nsmugglers will tend to carry larger quantities as they become more\nexperienced. When they carry larger quantities, it should be more\nlikely they would be apprehended. If the trip effect holds, the data\nwould mostly be about advanced smugglers who tend to carry more than\nbeginners. No empirical evidence for or against the trip effect theory\ncould be found. Information on the number of previous trips was\nmissing from the data so an appropriate regression model for the trip\neffect could not be developed. On other other hand, Judge Weinstein\nargued that beginner smugglers do practice swallowing with grapes, and\nthus the learning curve should not be excessively steep. In addition,\nbeginners are more likely to be apprehended than advanced smugglers.\nIf so, the data would not be biased by the trip effect. Interestingly,\ninformation on Nigerian drug smuggling practices undermines the trip\neffect theory: the drug cartel did not waste money on sending\nhalf-filled drug mules, but rather made them practice swallowing\nballoons weeks prior to their first trip (Treaser 1992; Wren\n1999).\n\nStatistical analyses of the evidence in Shonubi were published after\nthe case was decided. These analyses took into account other potential\nsources of error, such as outliers and biased data. Gastwirth,\nFreidlin, and Miao (2000) showed that, because of sensitivity to\noutliers, the inference that the total amount was above 3000 grams was\nunstable. However, even looking at the data in the light most\nfavorable to the defendant, the total amount of drugs should be above\nthe 1000 gram threshold (Gastwirth,\nFreidlin, and Miao 2000; Izenman 2000a,b).\n\nBesides Shonubi, many other cases raise the reference class or model\nselection in their own way. Just to list a few:\n\n\n\nVuyanich v.\u2006Republic National Bank involved race and\nsex discrimination allegation. The case involved nine different expert\nwitnesses deploying various statistical analyses. The case ended with\na 127-page opinion.\n\n\nE.E.O.C. v.\u2006Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond was a\nsimilar case, where the appropriateness of various methods for group\ncomparisons and the choice of level of aggregation for the analysis of\nemployment data was at play.\n\n\nGulf South Insulation v.\u2006U.S. Consumer Product Safety\nCommission was related to banning the use of urea-formaldehyde\nfoam insulation. The difficulty lied in the choice of a risk\nassessment model to calculate the risk of increased incidence of\ncancer.\n\n\nThese cases are interesting as well as complicated. They are discussed\nin some detail in Fienberg (1989).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Aitken, Colin, Paul Roberts, and Graham Jackson, 2010,\n\u201cFundamentals of Probability and Statistical Evidence in\nCriminal Proceedings: Guidance for Judges, Lawyers, Forensic\nScientists and Expert Witnesses\u201d (Practitioners Guide No 1),\nRoyal Statistical Society\u2019s <em> Working Group on Statistics and\nthe Law</em>.\n [<a href=\"https://rss.org.uk/news-publication/publications/law-guides/\" target=\"other\">Aitken, Roberts, and Jackson 2010 available online</a>]", "<li id=\"ref-aitken2004statistics\">Aitken, Colin G.G. and Franco\nTaroni, 1995 [2004], <em>Statistics and the Evaluation of Evidence for\nForensic Scientists</em>, Chichester, UK: John Wiley &amp; Sons.\nSecond edition, 2004. doi:10.1002/0470011238", "<li id=\"ref-Allen1986A-Reconceptuali\">Allen, Ronald J., 1986, \u201cA\nReconceptualization of Civil Trials\u201d, <em>Boston University Law\nReview</em>, 66: 401\u2013437.", "<li id=\"ref-allen2013\">\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2013, \u201cComplexity, the Generation of\nLegal Knowledge,\nand the Future of Litigation\u201d, <em>UCLA Law Review</em>, 60:\n1384\u20131411.", "<li id=\"ref-allen2014\">\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2014, \u201cBurdens of\nProof\u201d, <em>Law, Probability and Risk</em>, 13(3\u20134):\n195\u2013219. doi:10.1093/lpr/mgu005", "<li id=\"ref-allen2017\">\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2017, \u201cThe Nature of Juridical Proof: Probability as a Tool in Plausible Reasoning\u201d. <em>International Journal of Evidence and Proof</em>, 21(2): 133-142.", "<li id=\"ref-allen2020\">\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2020, \u201cLegal Probabilism\u2013\u2013\u2013A Qualified Rejection: A Response to Hedden and Colyvan\u201d. <em>Journal of Political Philosophy</em>, 28(1): 117-128.", "<li id=\"ref-Allen2021naturalized\"> \u2013\u2013\u2013, 2021,  \u201cNaturalized Epistemology and the Law of Evidence Revisited\u201d, <em>Quaestio Facti</em>, 2: 253\u2013283.", "<li id=\"ref-friedmanEtAl1995\">Allen, Ronald J., David J.
