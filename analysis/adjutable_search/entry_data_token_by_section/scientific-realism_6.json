    "main_text": "Considerations Against Scientific Realism (and Responses) || The Underdetermination of Theory by Data\n3.1 The Underdetermination of Theory by Data\n\nLined up in opposition to the various motivations for realism\npresented in\n section 2\n are a number of important antirealist arguments, all of which have\npressed realists either to attempt their refutation, or to modify\ntheir realism accordingly. One of these challenges, the\nunderdetermination of theory by data, has a storied history in\ntwentieth century philosophy more generally, and is often traced to\nthe work of Duhem ([1906] 1954: ch. 6; this is not an argument for\nunderdetermination as such, but is regarded as sowing the seeds). In\nremarks concerning the confirmation of scientific hypotheses (in\nphysics, which he contrasted with chemistry and physiology), Duhem\nnoted that a hypothesis cannot be used to derive testable predictions\nin isolation. To derive predictions one also requires\n\u201cauxiliary\u201d assumptions, such as background theories,\nhypotheses about instruments and measurements, etc. If subsequent\nobservation and experiment produces data that conflict with those\npredicted, one might think that this reflects badly on the hypothesis\nunder test, but Duhem pointed out that given all of the assumptions\nrequired to derive predictions, it is no simple matter to identify\nwhere the error lies. Different amendments to one\u2019s overall set\nof beliefs regarding hypotheses and theories will be consistent with\nthe data. A similar result is commonly associated with the later\n\u201cconfirmational holism\u201d of Quine (1953), according to\nwhich experience (including, of course, that associated with\nscientific testing) does not confirm or disconfirm individual beliefs\nper se, but rather the set of one\u2019s beliefs taken as a\nwhole. This sort of contention is now commonly referred to as the\n\u201cDuhem-Quine thesis\u201d (Quine 1975; see Ben-Menahem 2006 for\na historical introduction).\n\nHow then does this give rise to underdetermination, a presumptive\nconcern for realism? The argument from underdetermination proceeds as\nfollows: let us call the relevant, overall sets of scientific beliefs\n\u201ctheories\u201d; different, conflicting theories are consistent\nwith the data; the data exhaust the evidence for belief; therefore,\nthere is no evidential reason to believe one of these theories as\nopposed to another. Given that the theories differ precisely in what\nthey say about the unobservable (their observable\nconsequences\u2014the data\u2014are all shared), a challenge to\nrealism emerges: the choice of which theory to believe is\nunderdetermined by the data. In contemporary discussions, the\nchallenge is usually presented using slightly different terminology.\nEvery theory, it is said, has empirically equivalent rivals\u2014that\nis, rivals that agree with respect to the observable, but differ with\nrespect to the unobservable. This then serves as the basis of a\nskeptical argument regarding the truth of any particular theory the\nrealist may wish to endorse. Various forms of antirealism then suggest\nthat hypotheses and theories involving unobservables are endorsed, not\nmerely on the basis of evidence that may be relevant to their truth,\nbut also on the basis of other factors that are not indicative of\ntruth as such (see\n sections 3.2,\n and\n 4.2\u20134.4).\n (For recent explications, see van Fraassen 1980: ch. 3; Earman 1993;\nKukla 1998: chs. 5\u20136; and Stanford 2001.)\n\nThe argument from underdetermination is contested in a number of ways.\nOne might, for example, distinguish between underdetermination in\npractice (or at a time) and underdetermination in principle. In the\nformer case, there is underdetermination only because the data that\nwould support one theory or hypothesis at the expense of another is\nunavailable, pending foreseeable developments in experimental\ntechnique or instrumentation. Here, realism is arguably consistent\nwith a \u201cwait and see\u201d attitude, though if the prospect of\nfuture discriminating evidence is poor, a commitment to future realism\nmay be questioned thereby. In any case, most proponents of\nunderdetermination insist on the idea of underdetermination in\nprinciple: the idea that there are always (plausible) empirically\nequivalent rivals no matter what evidence may come to light. In\nresponse, some argue that the principled worry cannot be established,\nsince what counts as data is apt to change over time with the\ndevelopment of new techniques and instruments, and with changes in\nscientific background knowledge, which alter the auxiliary assumptions\nrequired to derive observable predictions (Laudan & Leplin 1991).\nSuch arguments may rest, however, on a different conception of\nobservation than that assumed by many antirealists (defined above, in\nterms of human sensory capacities). (For other responses, see Okasha\n2002; van Dyck 2007; Busch 2009; and Worrall 2011.)\n\nStanford (2006, 2015) proposes a historicized version of the argument\nfrom underdetermination, suggesting that the history of science\nreveals a recurring \u201cproblem of unconceived alternatives\u201d:\ntypically, at any given time, there are theories that do not occur to\nscientists but which are just as well confirmed by the available\nevidence as those that are, in fact, accepted; furthermore, over time,\nsuch unconceived theories often supplant the theories adopted by\nhistorical actors as the relevant science develops. (For discussions\nand evaluations of this challenge, see Chakravartty 2008;\nGodfrey-Smith 2008; Magnus 2010; Lyons 2013; Mizrahi 2015:\n139\u2013146; and Egg 2016; cf. Wray 2008 and Khalifa 2010 on the\nrelated notion of \u201cunderconsideration\u201d, as described by\nLipton 1993, [1991] 2004: 151\u2013163.)\n",
