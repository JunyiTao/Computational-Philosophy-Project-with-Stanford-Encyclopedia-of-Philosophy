    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\nRichard FitzRalph was born in Dundalk probably slightly before 1300. Although\nnot a member of the Gaelic race, he was referred to by his Oxford\ncontemporaries as \u201cHibernicus,\u201d as was the Anglo-Norman\nPeter of Ireland (Petrus de Hibernia, ca. 1200\u20131265) a generation\nbefore. Around the age of 15, he went to Oxford (there was no\nuniversity in Ireland before the reign of Elizabeth I) where he was a\nfellow of Balliol College, and he gained his MA there. He later\nwent to University College (then University Hall), where he graduated\nwith a doctorate in theology in 1331. He became chancellor of the\nUniversity of Oxford in 1332, embarking thereafter on a successful\necclesiastical career both in England and in Ireland. On his first\nvisit to Avignon, only five years after concluding his lectures on the\nSentences, FitzRalph it seems was consulted as one of the eighteen\nleading theologians of Europe by Pope Benedict XII to correct the views\nof his predecessor, John XXII, on the beatific vision. He became\narchbishop of Armagh in 1347. He is perhaps best known for his\nopposition to the mendicant orders on the question of evangelical\npoverty and his defense of the rights of the secular clergy against the\nfriars. It was while pursuing his suit against the mendicants that he\ndied at Avignon in 1360. In the company of Ockham, Bradwardine, and\nWodeham, FitzRalph became one of the four most frequently cited insular\ntheologians in the fourteenth century.\n",
