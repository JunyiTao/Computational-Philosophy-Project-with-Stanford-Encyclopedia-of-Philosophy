    "main_text": "The Mind and the Body\n5. Language and Speech\n\nThough it is in the Discernement that we find the basics of\nCordemoy\u2019s philosophy, it was his Discours physique de la\nparole which was most identified with him. (Unlike the\nDiscernement, the Discours was translated into\nEnglish during Cordemoy\u2019s lifetime.) The Discours opens\nwith the question of other minds: while I know that I am a thinking\nthing, how can I be certain that other humans are\u2014might not they\nbe mindless automata who only behave as if there were clever\nthoughts behind their behavior? Following Descartes, Cordemoy claims\nthat it is other humans\u2019 use of language\u2014both in its\ncomplexity and its creativity\u2014which assures me that they have\nminds, in that such communication cannot be explained on mechanical\nprinciples alone. Cordemoy then concludes this discussion, saying:\n\u201cNow that it is no longer possible for me to doubt that the\nbodies which resemble mine are united to souls, and since I am sure\nthat there are other men than me, I think that I ought to look with\ncare at what remains to be known about speech\u201d (1968, 209). The\nremainder of the Discours is taken up with this\ninvestigation.\n\n\u2018True\u2019 language use, as opposed to the mere production of\nsound, is according to Cordemoy a matter of \u201cgiving signs to\none\u2019s thoughts\u201d (1968 196). Language is on his account an\nartificial system of signs, the purpose of which is to communicate our\nthoughts, the words standing as their representatives, to one another.\nIt is the creative aspect of language which demands the presence of a\nrational soul. True speech requires two things, says Cordemoy:\n\u201cthe formation of the voice, which can only come from the body,\nand the signification or idea that is joined with it, which can only\ncome from the soul\u201d (1968, 198). Yet while there is a need for a\nsoul in order to engage in what would rightly be called genuine\nlanguage use, the ability to make sounds can be explained on entirely\nmechanistic grounds (the explanation being for Cordemoy very similar\nto how musical instruments produce sound). In this way sound\nproduction is like nutrition, circulation, and respiration, none of\nwhich, as Descartes had also believed, require a soul, but which\nresult instead from a proper disposition of one\u2019s organs. As for\nanimals such as parrots which not only make sounds, but utter words,\nCordemoy claims that \u2018returning words\u2019 is not a sign of a\nsoul in such creatures, any more than a canyon\u2019s echo requires\nrocks to have souls. As a testament to the significance of\nCordemoy\u2019s study of language, one scholar has written that\nCordemoy \u201cpicked up one of Descartes\u2019\narguments\u2014based on the lack of true speech among\nanimals\u2014and developed it fully; so fully, in fact, that after\nCordemoy the point was given very little attention, as if subsequent\nauthors considered this the last word on the subject\u201d\n(Rosenfield 1968, 40).\n",
