    "main_text": "The Metasemantic Interpretation || Propositional attitudes\n3.3 Propositional attitudes\n\nThe metasemantic 2D framework was originally developed to explain\ncommunication, but the framework can also be used to specify the\ncontent of certain beliefs and the content of assertions that\nattribute beliefs.\n\nStalnaker (1984) defends a coarse-grained account of belief contents,\nwhich individuates particular belief states in terms of a set of\npossible worlds that would make them true. If this project is to\nsucceed, it must be possible to fully specify beliefs without invoking\nanything like Fregean senses or conceptual structure. But there is an\nimportant class of beliefs that seem to pose insuperable problems for\na simple possible worlds account of their content: beliefs in\nnecessary truths. The problem for a standard possible worlds analysis\nis that all necessary truths have precisely the same content (the\nfunction mapping every world to True). So the belief that Hesperus\n= Phosphorus will have exactly the same content as a belief\nthat Hesperus = Hesperus & Fermat\u2019s last theorem is\ntrue. But these are clearly distinct belief states. Beliefs in\nidentities have been particularly important in motivating theories of\nfiner-grained thought contents.\n\nBut fine-grained Fregean senses or conceptual structures are not\nstrictly required to distinguish beliefs in identities. Stalnaker\n(1981; 1987) argues that the metasemantic 2D framework he developed to\nexplain what is communicated by an assertion of an identity\nsentence can also explain the content of the belief states\nattributed using an identity sentence to specify its content. If\nO\u2019Leary were to notice the pole star and think to himself\nthat\u2019s Mars, for instance, the truth-conditions of his\nthought can be captured by a judiciously defined diagonal proposition\n(Stalnaker 1987, 125). In this case, the worlds we include in the\ncontext set may involve facts about which object is the target of\nO\u2019Leary\u2019s visual attention and facts about salient\nempirical properties he associates with the name \u2018Mars\u2019.\nOn the metasemantic approach, then, the proposition we attribute in\nsaying O\u2019Leary believes that that is Mars is the\nproposition that the visually salient object is the object that has\nthose Martian properties.\n\nA further complication arises in specifying the content of attitude\nattributions. On the metasemantic account of assertion, the content\nconveyed by a sentence depends on the shared presuppositions of the\nspeaker and audience. But sometimes the parties to a discussion are\nbetter informed than the person they are describing. In philosophical\ndiscussions, for instance, it is standardly presupposed that\n\u2018Hesperus\u2019 and \u2018Phosphorus\u2019 are\nco-referential. So the diagonal intension associated with the sentence\n\u2018Hesperus \\(\\ne\\) Phosphorus\u2019 will be necessarily\nfalse when it\u2019s asserted in philosophical contexts (i.e.,\nit will be false when uttered in any situation compatible with what is\nbeing presupposed in the philosophical conversation). And yet when a\nphilosopher says that O\u2019Leary doesn\u2019t know that Hesperus\nis Phosphorus, she still manages to communicate that O\u2019Leary\nfails to grasp some contingent empirical proposition. On the face of\nit, the metasemantic account of assertion cannot explain how this is\npossible, since every cell of the metasemantic matrix for the identity\nclaim in this philosophical conversation will be assigned the value\nTrue.\n\nStalnaker\u2019s response to this problem is to suggest that the\ncontext set for a belief report must be expanded so as to include\nworlds that correspond to the way that the believer himself (i.e.\nO\u2019Leary) takes things to be. The diagonal proposition of the\nphilosopher\u2019s sentence is thus determined by considering what\nshe would be saying if her sentence were asserted in contexts\ncompatible with O\u2019Leary\u2019s beliefs (1987; 1988). However,\nthere is no general rule for choosing which worlds are the relevant\nones:\n\nThe procedure I am proposing for extending propositional concepts so\nthat the diagonalization strategy can be applied to problematic belief\nattributions takes examples case by case. It is not, as yet, very\nsatisfactory if we are looking for a systematic way to explain why the\ncomplements of belief attributions denote the propositions that they\nseem to denote. But if, using this procedure, we can find a possible\nworlds proposition that is a plausible candidate to be the object of\nbelief being attributed in the various problematic examples, then\n[\u2026] it will not be completely mysterious how these propositions\ncan be expressed by the sentences that seem to express them.\n(Stalnaker 1987, 129)\n\n\nThus, the metasemantic 2D framework provides adequate descriptive\nresources for characterizing mental states and our discourse about\nthem, without invoking fine-grained Fregean senses, concepts, or\nsyntactic structures. However, the metasemantic theory used to\nconstruct the relevant 2D matrices relies on unsystematic norms of\ncharitable interpretation to identify the precise contents of\nparticular attitudes and attitude reports (Stalnaker 1999b,\n 18\u201319).[23]\n",
