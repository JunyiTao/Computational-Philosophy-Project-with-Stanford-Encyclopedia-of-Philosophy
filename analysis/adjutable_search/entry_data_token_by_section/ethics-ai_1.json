    "main_text": "Introduction || AI & Robotics\n1.2 AI & Robotics\n\nThe notion of \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d (AI) is understood\nbroadly as any kind of artificial computational system that shows\nintelligent behaviour, i.e., complex behaviour that is conducive to\nreaching goals. In particular, we do not wish to restrict\n\u201cintelligence\u201d to what would require intelligence if done\nby humans, as Minsky had suggested (1985). This means we\nincorporate a range of machines, including those in \u201ctechnical\nAI\u201d, that show only limited abilities in learning or reasoning\nbut excel at the automation of particular tasks, as well as machines\nin \u201cgeneral AI\u201d that aim to create a generally intelligent\nagent.\n\nAI somehow gets closer to our skin than other technologies\u2014thus\nthe field of \u201cphilosophy of AI\u201d. Perhaps this is because\nthe project of AI is to create machines that have a feature central to\nhow we humans see ourselves, namely as feeling, thinking, intelligent\nbeings. The main purposes of an artificially intelligent agent\nprobably involve sensing, modelling, planning and action, but current\nAI applications also include perception, text analysis, natural\nlanguage processing (NLP), logical reasoning, game-playing, decision\nsupport systems, data analytics, predictive analytics, as well as\nautonomous vehicles and other forms of robotics (P. Stone et al.\n2016). AI may involve any number of computational techniques to\nachieve these aims, be that classical symbol-manipulating AI, inspired\nby natural cognition, or machine learning via neural networks\n(Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville 2016; Silver et al. 2018).\n\nHistorically, it is worth noting that the term \u201cAI\u201d was\nused as above ca. 1950\u20131975, then came into disrepute during the\n\u201cAI winter\u201d, ca. 1975\u20131995, and narrowed. As a\nresult, areas such as \u201cmachine learning\u201d, \u201cnatural\nlanguage processing\u201d and \u201cdata science\u201d were often\nnot labelled as \u201cAI\u201d. Since ca. 2010, the use has\nbroadened again, and at times almost all of computer science and even\nhigh-tech is lumped under \u201cAI\u201d. Now it is a name to be\nproud of, a booming industry with massive capital investment (Shoham\net al. 2018), and on the edge of hype again. As Erik Brynjolfsson\nnoted, it may allow us to\n\n\nvirtually eliminate global poverty, massively reduce disease and\nprovide better education to almost everyone on the planet. (quoted in\nAnderson, Rainie, and Luchsinger 2018)\n\n\nWhile AI can be entirely software, robots are physical machines that\nmove. Robots are subject to physical impact, typically through\n\u201csensors\u201d, and they exert physical force onto the world,\ntypically through \u201cactuators\u201d, like a gripper or a turning\nwheel. Accordingly, autonomous cars or planes are robots, and only a\nminuscule portion of robots is \u201chumanoid\u201d (human-shaped),\nlike in the movies. Some robots use AI, and some do not: Typical\nindustrial robots blindly follow completely defined scripts with\nminimal sensory input and no learning or reasoning (around 500,000\nsuch new industrial robots are installed each year (IFR 2019 [OIR])).\nIt is probably fair to say that while robotics systems cause more\nconcerns in the general public, AI systems are more likely to have a\ngreater impact on humanity. Also, AI or robotics systems for a narrow\nset of tasks are less likely to cause new issues than systems that are\nmore flexible and autonomous.\n\nRobotics and AI can thus be seen as covering two overlapping sets of\nsystems: systems that are only AI, systems that are only robotics, and\nsystems that are both. We are interested in all three; the scope of\nthis article is thus not only the intersection, but the union, of both\nsets.\n",
