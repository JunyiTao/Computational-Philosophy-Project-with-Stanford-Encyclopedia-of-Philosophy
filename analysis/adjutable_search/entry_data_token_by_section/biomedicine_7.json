    "main_text": "Epistemology of Biomedicine || Epistemology of expertise and experimental clinical data in biomedicine\n3.1 Epistemology of expertise and experimental clinical data in biomedicine\n\nBiomedicine is in a state of tension, between\n\n a history of resolving evidentiary disputes using mechanistic\nreasoning, consensus, and authority (see, e.g., Solomon [2015] on the\nroles played by \u2018consensus conferences\u2019) vs.\n a recent practice of creating predetermined evidentiary\nranking/\u200bevaluating procedures designed to minimize the ability\nof biased or erratic human judgments to unduly influence the\nresolution of evidentiary disputes. \n\n\nClinical guidelines were once routinely created by what is\npejoratively called GOBSAT: Good Old Boys Sat Around A Table (and\nreached a consensus by talking amongst themselves as leading experts\nin the subject matter). As Greenhalgh puts it, \u201cit is a major\nachievement of the EBM movement that almost no guideline these days is\nproduced by GOBSAT!\u201d (Greenhalgh 2014: 7). It remains a point of\nphilosophical contention just how epistemically different it is to\ngenerate clinical practice guidelines using a consensus-based model\nvs. an evidence-based model, in large part since, no matter what\nevidence is prioritized, a group of experts will ultimately need to\ninterpret the data and make judgment calls on how to generate\npractical guidelines based on the compiled evidence (Djulbegovic &\nGuyatt 2019). Though even the meaning of clinical expertise is itself\nnot clearly defined and agreed upon, a matter further complicated by\nthe way that the meaning of expertise is tangled up with views about\nwhat roles expertise ought to be playing in clinical practice (Wieten\n2018).\n\nEvidence-based medicine prizes certain types of biomedical\nevidence\u2014highly controlled and systematic evidence\u2014more\nhighly than others. But that preference is a matter of much\ncontention. As noted above, experimental evidence from a randomized\nexperiment testing a treatment (a \u201crandomized control\ntrial\u201d) is held as the best sort of evidence: the gold standard.\nThe one exception is that \u201cmeta-analyses\u201d of multiple\nexperimental studies are perhaps a platinum standard better than gold\n(Stegenga 2011), i.e., the thinking goes that the only evidence that\nmight be better than such experimental data is a rigorous quantitative\nstudy rigorously looking for patterns and lessons by analyzing the\nresults many rigorous experimental studies. While the rigidity of EBM\nthinking gets a great deal of criticism, there are elements of the\nEBM\u2019s philosophy that implement the sort of pragmatism that many\ncritics desire, such as an epistemic openness in the community to\nengage in \u201copen-ended critical inquiry\u201d (Goldenberg\n2009).\n",
