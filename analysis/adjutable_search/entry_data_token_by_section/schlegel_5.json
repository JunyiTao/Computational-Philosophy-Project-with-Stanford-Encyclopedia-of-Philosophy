    "main_text": "Ethical, Social and Political Philosophy\n6. Later Philosophy of Life, History and Religion\n\nIn the final twenty years of his life in Vienna, Schlegel followed on\nthe success of his brother\u2019s famous Lectures on Dramatic Art and\nLiterature, given in that city in 1808,with several lecture\nseries of his own. He lectured on modern European history (1810),\nancient and modern literature (1811), the philosophy of life (1827),\nthe philosophy of history (1828) and the philosophy of language\n(1828\u20131829, a lecture series that was never completed because of\nSchlegel\u2019s death).\n\nGiven Schlegel\u2019s conversion and the more conservative tendency of his\nlater political thought, commentators have often raised questions\nabout the continuity between the earlier romantic phase and Schlegel\u2019s\nlater work. Blanchot puts this line of questioning most sharply:\n\n[A]s a young man he is an atheist, a radical, and an\nindividualist\u2026 Some years pass: the same Schlegel, converted to\nCatholicism, a diplomat and journalist in the service of Metternich,\nsurrounded by monks and pious men of society, is no longer anything\nbut a fat philistine of unctuous speech, lazy, empty, his mind on\nfood, and incapable of remembering the young man who had written:\n\u2018A single absolute law: the free spirit always triumphs over\nnature.\u2019 Which is the real one? Is the later Schlegel the truth\nof the first? Does the struggle against a bourgeois who is banal\nengender no more than a bourgeois who is exalted, then weary, and\nfinally only contribute to an exaltation of the bourgeoisie? Where is\nromanticism? In Jena or Vienna? [Blanchot 1993, 352]\n\n\nThere is, to be sure, a rather different style and tone evident in\nmany of Schlegel\u2019s later writings and lectures. In some of the lecture\nseries, there is a good deal of repetition and argumentative\nflaccidity of a sort the young Schlegel would no doubt have sharply\ncriticized. But it is far from clear that Vienna represented simply a\nphase of ossification in Schlegel\u2019s intellectual life or even a turn\naway from the most important philosophical and literary concerns of\nthe young romantic. The literary lectures reveal interesting shifts in\nhis treatment of the literary genres (Eichner 1970, 117\u201323), the\nphilosophy of life pleads not unconvincingly for a\n\u201cmodest\u201d conception of philosophizing that avoids the\nexcesses of merely abstract or empirical points of departure (Schlegel\n1847), and the philosophy of language insists upon the essentially\ndialogical character of human thought and expression (Schlegel\n1847).\n",
