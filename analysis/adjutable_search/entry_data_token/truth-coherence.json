The coherence theory differs from its principal\ncompetitor, the correspondence theory of truth, in two essential\nrespects. The competing theories give conflicting accounts of the\nrelation that propositions bear to their truth conditions. (In this\narticle, \u2018proposition\u2019 is not used in any technical sense.\nIt simply refers to the bearers of truth values, whatever they may\nbe.)  According to one, the relation is coherence, according to the\nother, it is correspondence. The two theories also give conflicting\naccounts of truth conditions. According to the coherence theory, the\ntruth conditions of propositions consist in other propositions. The\ncorrespondence theory, in contrast, states that the truth conditions\nof propositions are not (in general) propositions, but rather\nobjective features of the world. (Even the correspondence theorist\nholds that propositions about propositions have propositions as their\ntruth conditions.) Although the coherence and correspondence theories\nare fundamentally opposed in this way, they both present (in contrast\nto deflationary theories of truth) a substantive conception of\ntruth. That is, unlike deflationary theories, the coherence and\ncorrespondence theories both hold that truth is a property of\npropositions that can be analysed in terms of the sorts of\ntruth-conditions propositions have, and the relations propositions\nstand in to these conditions. \n", "toc": [{"#Ver": "1.

Versions of the Coherence Theory of Truth\n\n\nThe coherence theory of truth has several versions. These versions\ndiffer on two major issues. Different versions of the theory give\ndifferent accounts of the coherence relation. Different varieties of\nthe theory also give various accounts of the set (or sets) of\npropositions with which true propositions cohere. (Such\na set will be called a specified set.) \n\n\nAccording to some early versions of the coherence theory, the\ncoherence relation is simply consistency. On this view, to say that a\nproposition coheres with a specified set of propositions is to say that\nthe proposition is consistent with the set. This account of coherence\nis unsatisfactory for the following reason. Consider two propositions\nwhich do not belong to a specified set. These propositions could both\nbe consistent with a specified set and yet be inconsistent with each\nother. If coherence is consistency, the coherence theorist would have\nto claim that both propositions are true, but this is impossible.\n\n\nA more plausible version of the coherence theory states that the\ncoherence relation is some form of entailment. Entailment can be\nunderstood here as strict logical entailment, or entailment in some\nlooser sense. According to this version, a proposition coheres with a\nset of propositions if and only if it is entailed by members of the\nset. Another more plausible version of the theory, held for example in\nBradley (1914), is that coherence is mutual explanatory support\nbetween propositions.\n\n\nThe second point on which coherence theorists (coherentists, for\nshort) differ is the constitution of the specified set of propositions.\nCoherentists generally agree that the specified set consists of\npropositions believed or held to be true. They differ on the questions\nof who believes the propositions and when. At one extreme, coherence\ntheorists can hold that the specified set of propositions is the\nlargest consistent set of propositions currently believed by actual\npeople. For such a version of the theory, see Young (1995). According\nto a moderate position, the specified set consists of those\npropositions which will be believed when people like us (with finite\ncognitive capacities) have reached some limit of inquiry. For such a\ncoherence theory, see Putnam (1981). At the other extreme, coherence\ntheorists can maintain that the specified set contains the propositions\nwhich would be believed by an omniscient being. Some idealists seem to\naccept this account of the specified set.\n\n\nIf the specified set is a set actually believed, or even a set which\nwould be believed by people like us at some limit of inquiry,\ncoherentism involves the rejection of realism about truth. Realism\nabout truth involves acceptance of the principle of bivalence\n(according to which every proposition is either true or false) and the\nprinciple of transcendence (which says that a proposition may be true\neven though it cannot be known to be true). Coherentists who do not\nbelieve that the specified set is the set of propositions believed by\nan omniscient being are committed to rejection of the principle of\nbivalence since it is not the case that for every proposition either it\nor a contrary proposition coheres with the specified set. They reject\nthe principle of transcendence since, if a proposition coheres with a\nset of beliefs, it can be known to cohere with the set.\n2. Arguments for Coherence Theories of Truth\n\n\nTwo principal lines of argument have led philosophers to adopt a\ncoherence theory of truth. Early advocates of coherence theories were\npersuaded by reflection on metaphysical questions. More recently,\nepistemological and semantic considerations have been the basis for\ncoherence theories. \n2.1 The Metaphysical Route to Coherentism\n\n\nEarly versions of the coherence theory were associated with\nidealism. Walker (1989) attributes coherentism to Spinoza, Kant, Fichte\nand Hegel. Certainly a coherence theory was adopted by a number of\nBritish Idealists in the last years of the nineteenth century and the\nfirst decades of the twentieth. See, for example, Bradley\n(1914).\n\n\nIdealists are led to a coherence theory of truth by their\nmetaphysical position. Advocates of the correspondence theory believe\nthat a belief is (at least most of the time) ontologically distinct\nfrom the objective conditions which make the belief true. Idealists do\nnot believe that there is an ontological distinction between beliefs\nand what makes beliefs true. From the idealists\u2019 perspective, reality\nis something like a collection of beliefs. Consequently, a belief\ncannot be true because it corresponds to something which is not a\nbelief. Instead, the truth of a belief can only consist in its\ncoherence with other beliefs. A coherence theory of truth which results\nfrom idealism usually leads to the view that truth comes in degrees. A\nbelief is true to the degree that it coheres with other beliefs.\n\n\nSince idealists do not recognize an ontological distinction between\nbeliefs and what makes them true, distinguishing between versions of\nthe coherence theory of truth adopted by idealists and an identity\ntheory of truth can be difficult. The article on Bradley in this\nEncyclopedia (Candlish 2006) argues that Bradley had an identity\ntheory, not a coherence theory.\n\n\nIn recent years metaphysical arguments for coherentism have found\nfew advocates. This is due to the fact that idealism is not widely\nheld.\n2.2 Epistemological Routes to Coherentism\n\n\nBlanshard (1939, ch. XXVI) argues that a coherence theory of\njustification leads to a coherence theory of truth. His argument runs\nas follows. Someone might hold that coherence with a set of beliefs is\nthe test of truth but that truth consists in correspondence to\nobjective facts. If, however, truth consists in correspondence to\nobjective facts, coherence with a set of beliefs will not be a test of\ntruth. This is the case since there is no guarantee that a perfectly\ncoherent set of beliefs matches objective reality. Since coherence with\na set of beliefs is a test of truth, truth cannot consist in\ncorrespondence.\n\n\nBlanshard\u2019s argument has been criticised by, for example, Rescher\n(1973). Blanshard\u2019s argument depends on the claim that coherence with a\nset of beliefs is the test of truth. Understood in one sense, this\nclaim is plausible enough. Blanshard, however, has to understand this\nclaim in a very strong sense: coherence with a set of beliefs is an\ninfallible test of truth. If coherence with a set of beliefs is simply\na good but fallible test of truth, as Rescher suggests, the argument\nfails. The \u201cfalling apart\u201d of truth and justification to which\nBlanshard refers is to be expected if truth is only a fallible test of\ntruth.\n\n\nAnother epistemological argument for coherentism is based on the\nview that we cannot \u201cget outside\u201d our set of beliefs and compare\npropositions to objective facts. A version of this argument was\nadvanced by some logical positivists including Hempel (1935) and\nNeurath (1983). This argument, like Blanshard\u2019s, depends on a coherence\ntheory of justification. The argument infers from such a theory that we\ncan only know that a proposition coheres with a set of beliefs. We can\nnever know that a proposition corresponds to reality.\n\n\nThis argument is subject to at least two criticisms. For a start, it\ndepends on a coherence theory of justification, and is vulnerable to\nany objections to this theory. More importantly, a coherence theory of\ntruth does not follow from the premisses. We cannot infer from the fact\nthat a proposition cannot be known to correspond to reality that it\ndoes not correspond to reality. Even if correspondence theorists admit\nthat we can only know which propositions cohere with our beliefs, they\ncan still hold that truth consists in correspondence. If correspondence\ntheorists adopt this position, they accept that there may be truths\nwhich cannot be known. Alternatively, they can argue, as does Davidson\n(1986), that the coherence of a proposition with a set of beliefs is a\ngood indication that the proposition corresponds to objective facts and\nthat we can know that propositions correspond.\n\n\nCoherence theorists need to argue that propositions cannot\ncorrespond to objective facts, not merely that they cannot be known to\ncorrespond. In order to do this, the foregoing argument for coherentism\nmust be supplemented. One way to supplement the argument would be to\nargue as follows. As noted above, the correspondence and coherence\ntheories have differing views about the nature of truth conditions. One\nway to decide which account of truth conditions is correct is to pay\nattention to the process by which propositions are assigned truth\nconditions. Coherence theorists can argue that the truth conditions of\na proposition are the conditions under which speakers make a practice\nof asserting it. Coherentists can then maintain that speakers can only\nmake a practice of asserting a proposition under conditions the\nspeakers are able to recognise as justifying the proposition. Now the\n(supposed) inability of speakers to \u201cget outside\u201d of their beliefs is\nsignificant. Coherentists can argue that the only conditions speakers\ncan recognise as justifying a proposition are the conditions under\nwhich it coheres with their beliefs. When the speakers make a practice\nof asserting the proposition under these conditions, they become the\nproposition\u2019s truth conditions. For an argument of this sort see Young\n(1995).\n3. Criticisms of Coherence Theories of Truth\n\n\nAny coherence theory of truth faces two principal challenges. The first\nmay be called the specification objection. The second is the\ntranscendence objection. \n3.1 The Specification Objection\n\n\nAccording to the specification objection, coherence theorists have\nno way to identify the specified set of propositions without\ncontradicting their position. This objection originates in Russell\n(1907). Opponents of the coherence theory can argue as follows. The\nproposition (1) \u201cJane Austen was hanged for murder\u201d coheres\nwith some set of propositions. (2) \u201cJane Austen died in her\nbed\u201d coheres with another set of propositions. No one supposes\nthat the first of these propositions is true, in spite of the fact that\nit coheres with a set of propositions. The specification objection\ncharges that coherence theorists have no grounds for saying that (1) is\nfalse and (2) true.\n\n\nSome responses to the specification problem are unsuccessful. One\ncould say that we have grounds for saying that (1) is false and (2) is\ntrue because the latter coheres with propositions which correspond to\nthe facts. Coherentists cannot, however, adopt this response without\ncontradicting their position. Sometimes coherence theorists maintain\nthat the specified system is the most comprehensive system, but this\nis not the basis of a successful response to the specification\nproblem.  Coherentists can only, unless they are to compromise their\nposition, define comprehensiveness in terms of the size of a\nsystem. Coherentists cannot, for example, talk about the most\ncomprehensive system composed of propositions which correspond to\nreality. There is no reason, however, why two or more systems cannot\nbe equally large. Other criteria of the specified system, to which\ncoherentists frequently appeal, are similarly unable to solve the\nspecification problem. These criteria include simplicity, empirical\nadequacy and others. Again, there seems to be no reason why two or\nmore systems cannot equally meet these criteria.\n\n\nAlthough some responses to the Russell\u2019s version of the\nspecification objection are unsuccessful, it is unable to refute the\ncoherence theory. Coherentists do not believe that the truth of a\nproposition consists in coherence with any arbitrarily chosen set of\npropositions. Rather, they hold that truth consists in coherence with a\nset of beliefs, or with a set of propositions held to be true. No one\nactually believes the set of propositions with which (1) coheres.\nCoherence theorists conclude that they can hold that (1) is false\nwithout contradicting themselves.\n\n\nA more sophisticated version of the specification objection has been\nadvanced by Walker (1989); for a discussion, see Wright (1995). Walker\nargues as follows. In responding to Russell\u2019s version of the\nspecification objection, coherentists claim that some set of\npropositions, call it S, is believed. They are committed to\nthe truth of (3) \u201cS is believed.\u201d The question of\nwhat it is for (3) to be true then arises. Coherence theorists might\nanswer this question by saying that \u201c\u2018S is\nbelieved\u2019 is believed\u201d is true. If they give this answer,\nthey are apparently off on an infinite regress, and they will never\nsay what it is for a proposition to be true. Their plight is worsened\nby the fact that arbitrarily chosen sets of propositions can include\npropositions about what is believed. So, for example, there will be a\nset which contains \u201cJane Austen was hanged for murder,\u201d\n\u201c\u2018Jane Austen was hanged for murder\u2019 is\nbelieved,\u201d and so on. The only way to stop the regress seems to\nbe to say that the truth conditions of (3) consist in the objective\nfact S is believed. If, however, coherence theorists adopt\nthis position, they seem to contradict their own position by accepting\nthat the truth conditions of some proposition consist in facts, not in\npropositions in a set of beliefs.\n\n\nThere is some doubt about whether Walker\u2019s version of the\nspecification objection succeeds. Coherence theorists can reply to\nWalker by saying that nothing in their position is inconsistent with\nthe view that there is a set of propositions which is\nbelieved. Even though this objective fact obtains, the truth conditions\nof propositions, including propositions about which sets of\npropositions are believed, are the conditions under which they cohere\nwith a set of propositions. For a defence of the coherence theory against\nWalker\u2019s version of the specification objection, see Young (2001).\n\n\nA coherence theory of truth gives rise to a regress, but it is not a\nvicious regress and the correspondence theory faces a similar regress.\nIf we say that p is true if and only if it coheres with a\nspecified set of propositions, we may be asked about the truth\nconditions of \u201cp coheres with a specified set.\u201d\nPlainly, this is the start of a regress, but not one to worry\nabout. It is just what one would expect, given that the coherence\ntheory states that it gives an account of the truth conditions of all\npropositions.  The correspondence theory faces a similar benign\nregress. The correspondence theory states that a proposition is true\nif and only if it corresponds to certain objective conditions. The\nproposition \u201cp corresponds to certain objective\nconditions\u201d is also true if and only if it corresponds to\ncertain objective conditions, and so on.\n3.2 The Transcendence Objection\n\n\nThe transcendence objection charges that a coherence theory of truth\nis unable to account for the fact that some propositions are true which\ncohere with no set of beliefs. According to this objection, truth\ntranscends any set of beliefs. Someone might argue, for example, that\nthe proposition \u201cJane Austen wrote ten sentences on November\n17th, 1807\u201d is either true or false. If it is false, some other\nproposition about how many sentences Austen wrote that day is true. No\nproposition, however, about precisely how many sentences Austen wrote\ncoheres with any set of beliefs and we may safely assume that none will\never cohere with a set of beliefs. Opponents of the coherence theory\nwill conclude that there is at least one true proposition which does\nnot cohere with any set of beliefs.\n\n\nSome versions of the coherence theory are immune to the\ntranscendence objection. A version which holds that truth is coherence\nwith the beliefs of an omniscient being is proof against the objection.\nEvery truth coheres with the set of beliefs of an omniscient being. All\nother versions of the theory, however, have to cope with the objection,\nincluding the view that truth is coherence with a set of propositions\nbelieved at the limit of inquiry. Even at the limit of inquiry, finite\ncreatures will not be able to decide every question, and truth may\ntranscend what coheres with their beliefs.\n\n\nCoherence theorists can defend their position against the\ntranscendence objection by maintaining that the objection begs the\nquestion. Those who present the objection assume, generally without\nargument, that it is possible that some proposition be true even though\nit does not cohere with any set of beliefs. This is precisely what\ncoherence theorists deny. Coherence theorists have arguments for\nbelieving that truth cannot transcend what coheres with some set of\nbeliefs. Their opponents need to take issue with these arguments rather\nthan simply assert that truth can transcend what coheres with a\nspecified system.\n3.3 The Logic Objection\n\n\nRussell (1912) presented a third classic objection to the coherence\ntheory of truth. According to this objection, any talk about coherence\npresupposes the truth of the laws of logic. For example, Russell\nargues, to say that two propositions cohere with each other is to\npresuppose the truth of the law of non-contradiction. In this case,\ncoherentism has no account of the truth of law of\nnon-contradiction. If, however, the coherence theorist holds that the\ntruth of the law of non-contradiction depends on its coherence with a\nsystem of beliefs, and it were supposed to be false, then propositions\ncannot cohere or fail to cohere. In this case, the coherence theory of\ntruth completely breaks down since propositions cannot cohere with\neach other.\n\nCoherentists have a plausible response to this objection. They may\nhold that the law of non-contradiction, like any other truth, is true\nbecause it coheres with a system of beliefs. In particular, the law of\nnon-contradiction is supported by the belief that, for example,\ncommunication and reasoning would be impossible unless every system of\nbeliefs contains something like law of non-contradiction (and the\nbelief that communication and reasoning are possible). It is true\nthat, as Russell says, if the law is supposed not to cohere with a\nsystem of beliefs, then propositions can neither cohere nor fail to\ncohere. However, coherence theorists may hold, they do not suppose the\nlaw of non-contradiction to be false. On the contrary, they are likely\nto hold that any coherent set of beliefs must include the law of\nnon-contradiction or a similar law.\n4. New Objections to Coherentism\n\n Paul Thagard is the author of the first of two recent new arguments\n against the coherence theory. Thagard states his argument as\n follows:\nif there is a world independent of representations of it,\nas historical evidence suggests, then the aim of representation should\nbe to describe the world, not just to relate to other\nrepresentations. My argument does not refute the coherence theory, but\nshows that it implausibly gives minds too large a place in\nconstituting truth. (Thagard 2007: 29\u201330)\n\n\nThagard\u2019s argument seems to be that if there is a mind-independent\nworld, then our representations are representations of the world. (He\nsays representations \u201cshould be\u201d of the world, but the\nargument is invalid with the addition of the auxiliary verb.) The\nworld existed before humans and our representations, including our\npropositional representations. (So history and, Thagard would likely\nsay, our best science tells us.)  Therefore, representations,\nincluding propositional representations, are representations of a\nmind-independent world. The second sentence of the passage just quoted\nsuggests that the only way that coherentists can reject this argument\nis to adopt some sort of idealism. That is, they can only reject the\nminor premiss of the argument as reconstructed. Otherwise they are\ncommitted to saying that propositions represent the world and, Thagard\nseems to suggest, this is to say that propositions have the sort of\ntruth-conditions posited by a correspondence theory. So the coherence\ntheory is false.\n\n\nIn reply to this argument, coherentists can deny that\npropositions are representations of a mind-independent world. To say\nthat a proposition is true is to say that it is supported by a\nspecified system of propositions. So, the coherentist can say,\npropositions are representations of systems of beliefs, not\nrepresentations of a mind-independent world. To assert a proposition\nis to assert that it is entailed by a system of beliefs. The\ncoherentist holds that even if there is a mind-independent world, it\ndoes not follow that the \u201cthe point\u201d of representations is\nto represent this world. If coherentists have been led to their\nposition by an epistemological route, they believe that we cannot\n\u201cget outside\u201d our system of beliefs. If we cannot get\noutside of our system of beliefs, then it is hard to see how we can be\nsaid to represent a mind-independent reality.\n\n\nColin McGinn has proposed the other new objection to coherentism. He\nargues (McGinn 2002: 195) that coherence theorists are committed to\nidealism. Like Thagard, he takes idealism to be obviously false, so\nthe argument is a reductio. McGinn\u2019s argument runs as\nfollows. Coherentists are committed to the view that, for example,\n\u2018Snow falls from the sky\u2019 is true iff the belief that snow\nfalls from the sky coheres with other beliefs. Now it follows from\nthis and the redundancy biconditional (p is true\niff p) that snow falls from the sky iff the belief that snow\nfalls from the sky coheres with other beliefs. It appears then that\nthe coherence theorist is committed to the view that snow could not\nfall from the sky unless the belief that snow falls from the sky\ncoheres with other beliefs. From this it follows that how things are\ndepends on what is believed about them. This seems strange to McGinn\nsince he thinks, reasonably, that snow could fall from the sky even if\nthere were no beliefs about snow, or anything else. The linking of how\nthings are and how they are believed to be leads McGinn to say that\ncoherentists are committed to idealism, this being the view that how\nthings are is mind-dependent.\n\n\nCoherentists have a response to this objection. McGinn\u2019s argument\nworks because he takes it that the redundancy biconditional means\nsomething like \u201cp is true\nbecause p\u201d. Only if redundancy biconditionals are\nunderstood in this way does McGinn\u2019s argument go through. McGinn needs\nto be talking about what makes \u201cSnow falls from the sky\u201d\ntrue for his reductio to work. Otherwise, coherentists who reject his\nargument cannot be charged with idealism. He assumes, in a way that a\ncoherent theorist can regard as question-begging, that the truth-maker\nof the sentence in question is an objective way the world\nis. Coherentists deny that any sentences are made true by objective\nconditions. In particular, they hold that the falling of snow from the\nsky does not make \u201cSnow falls from the sky\u201d\ntrue. Coherentists hold that it, like any other sentence, is true\nbecause it coheres with a system of beliefs. So coherentists appear to\nhave a plausible defence against McGinn\u2019s objection.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Blanshard, B., 1939, <em>The Nature of Thought</em>, London:\nGeorge Allen and Unwin.", "Bradley, F., 1914, <em>Essays on Truth and Reality</em>, Oxford:\nClarendon Press.", "Cavendish, S., 2006, \u201cFrancis H.
