    "main_text": "The Stoics\n5. The Stoics\n\n\nThe founder of the Stoa, Zeno of Citium (335\u2013263 BCE), studied\nwith Diodorus. His successor Cleanthes (331\u2013232) tried to solve\nthe Master Argument by denying that every past truth is necessary and\nwrote books\u2014now lost\u2014on paradoxes, dialectics, argument\nmodes and predicates. Both philosophers considered knowledge of logic\nas a virtue and held it in high esteem, but they seem not to have been\ncreative logicians. By contrast, Cleanthes\u2019 successor Chrysippus of\nSoli (c. 280\u2013207) is without doubt the second great logician in\nthe history of logic. It was said of him that if the gods used any\nlogic, it would be that of Chrysippus (D. L. 7.180), and his reputation\nas a brilliant logician is amply attested. Chrysippus wrote over 300\nbooks on logic, on virtually every topic logic today concerns itself\nwith, including speech act theory, sentence analysis, singular and\nplural expressions, types of predicates, indexicals, existential\npropositions, sentential connectives, negations, disjunctions,\nconditionals, logical consequence, valid argument forms, theory of\ndeduction, propositional logic, modal logic, tense logic, epistemic\nlogic, logic of suppositions, logic of imperatives, ambiguity and\nlogical paradoxes, in particular the Liar and the Sorites\n(D. L. 7.189\u2013199). Of all these, only two badly damaged papyri\nhave survived, luckily supplemented by a considerable number of\nfragments and testimonies in later texts, in particular in Diogenes\nLaertius (D. L.) book 7, sections 55\u201383, and Sextus Empiricus\nOutlines of Pyrrhonism (S. E. PH) book 2 and\nAgainst the Mathematicians (S. E. M) book\n8. Chrysippus\u2019 successors, including Diogenes of Babylon (c.\n240\u2013152) and Antipater of Tarsus (2nd cent. BCE),\nappear to have systematized and simplified some of his ideas, but\ntheir original contributions to logic seem small. Many testimonies of\nStoic logic do not name any particular Stoic. Hence the following\nparagraphs simply talk about \u2018the Stoics\u2019 in general; but\nwe can be confident that a large part of what has survived goes back\nto Chrysippus.\n",
