The Empirical Evidence\n\nLiberal defenders of pornography readily admit that, if there were\nreliable evidence to show that consumption of pornography significantly\nincreases the incidence of violent sexual crime, there would be a very\nstrong liberal case for prohibiting it. However, liberal defenders of\npornography remain unconvinced that there is reliable evidence to show\nthat pornography is a cause of rape or other sexual crime. Ronald\nDworkin, for example, writes \u201c\u2026in spite of MacKinnon\u2019s\nfervent declarations, no reputable study has concluded that pornography\nis a significant cause of sexual crime: many of them conclude, on the\ncontrary, that the causes of violent personality lie mainly in\nchildhood, before exposure to pornography can have had any effect, and\nthat desire for pornography is a symptom rather than a cause of\ndeviance\u201d (1993, 38).\n\nThe question of whether pornography causes harm raises tricky\nconceptual issues about the notion of causality, as well as empirical\nand methodological ones (Eaton 2007; Schauer 1987; The Attorney\nGeneral\u2019s Commission on Pornography 1986, excerpts from which are\nreprinted in Mappes and Zembaty 1997, 212\u2013218). The causal\nconnection between consumption of pornography and violent sexual crime,\nif there is one, is unlikely to be a simple one. As some liberals have\nargued, it seems implausible to think that consumption of pornography,\non a single or even repeated occasions, will cause otherwise\n\u201cnormal, decent chaps\u201d with no propensity to rape suddenly\n\u201cto metamorphose into rapists\u201d(Feinberg, 1985, 153; also\nsee entry on\n Freedom of Speech).\nHowever, we might agree with Feinberg and yet think that pornography\nmight still be a cause of rape. Consumption of pornography might cause\nrape by making it more likely that those who are already inclined to\nrape will actually rape, thereby increasing the overall incidence of\nrape. Of course, pornography may not be the only cause of rape\nor other violent sexual crime. The contributing causes of violence\nagainst women are likely to be numerous and connected in complex ways:\nthey may include, among other things, \u201cmacho values\u201d (as\nFeinberg suggests) and certain sorts of childhood events and\ncircumstances (as R. Dworkin says). But the mere fact that there may be\nother causes of sexual violence against women does not show\nthat consumption of pornography cannot also be a cause.\nConsumption of pornography may, on its own, be neither necessary nor\nsufficient for violent sexual crime (or for sexist attitudes and\nbehavior more generally); yet it might still be a cause of violent\nsexual crime and these other harms if it increases the incidence of\nthem.\n\nIt might be helpful to consider an analogy with smoking. Smoking\ncigarettes, on its own, is neither a necessary nor a sufficient\ncondition for developing lung cancer, since there are people who smoke\nlike chimneys who never develop lung cancer and live perfectly healthy\nlives to a ripe old age; and there are people who have never smoked a\ncigarette in their whole life who develop lung cancer. Yet it is\ngenerally agreed nowadays that smoking cigarettes is a cause of lung\ncancer. This is because smoking (in combination with other factors such\nas genetics, diet and exercise) makes it significantly more likely that\na person will develop lung cancer, or so the studies suggest. Likewise,\nwe might think that consumption of pornography will be a cause of\nviolent sexual crime (or of sexist attitudes and behavior more\ngenerally) if there is good evidence to suggest that consumption of\npornography increases the incidence of sexual violence or sexist\nbehavior, holding fixed other known causes of these harmful states of\naffairs.[6]\n\nThere is considerable disagreement, among social science researchers\nas well as liberal and feminist philosophers, about whether pornography\nis a cause of violent sexual crime (Donnerstein et al. 1987; Copp and\nWendell 1983; Itzin 1992). Both the final report of the Commission on\nObscenity and Pornography in the U.S. in 1970 and the Williams\nCommittee Report on Obscenity and Film Censorship in the U.K. surveyed\nthe data from clinical and experimental trials then available and found\nno evidence of a causal connection between pornography and rape\n(although the 1970 Commission did not review the evidence concerning\nsexually violent material). However, the Attorney General\u2019s Commission\non Pornography in the U.S., which submitted its final report in 1986,\nfound that the clinical and experimental research \u201cvirtually\nunanimously\u201d shows that exposure to sexually violent material\nincreases the likelihood of aggression toward women and that \u201cthe\navailable evidence strongly supports the hypothesis that substantial\nexposure to sexually violent materials\u2026bears a causal\nrelationship to antisocial acts of sexual violence and, for some\nsubgroups, possibly to unlawful acts of sexual violence\u201d (Mappes\nand Zembaty 1997, 215). The report also found that non-violent but\ndegrading pornographic material produced effects \u201csimilar to,\nalthough not as extensive as that involved with violent\nmaterial.\u201d However, the report concluded that non-degrading and\nnon-violent material (erotica, in feminist terms) \u201cdoes not bear\na causal relationship to rape and other acts of sexual\nviolence.\u201d\n\nA more recent meta-analysis revealed an overall significant positive\nassociation between pornography use and attitudes supporting violence\nagainst women in non-experimental, as well as experimental, settings\n(Hald, Malamuth and Yuen 2010).\n\nA number of studies have found a positive correlation between\nexposure to violent pornographic images (for example, of rape, bondage,\nmolestation involving weapons and mutilation) and positive reactions to\nrape and other forms of violence against women. Studies suggest, among\nother things, that exposure to violent pornography can significantly\nenhance a subject\u2019s arousal in response to the portrayal of rape, that\nexposure to films that depict sexual violence against women can act as\na stimulus for aggressive acts against women, and that prolonged\nexposure to degrading pornography (of a violent or non-violent sort)\nleads to increased callousness towards victims of sexual violence, a\ngreater acceptance of \u201crape-myths\u201d (for example, that women\nenjoy rape and do not mean no when they say \u201cno\u201d), a\ngreater likelihood of having rape-fantasies, and a greater likelihood\nof reporting that one would rape women or force women into unwanted sex\nacts if there was no chance of being caught. Skeptics, however, argue\nthat existing studies have serious limitations and flaws (Altman 2018)\nand point to countries such as Japan that have low reported rates of\nsexual assault but high rates of pornography consumption as evidence\nthat the connection between pornography consumption and sexual violence\nis weak (Strossen 1995).\n",
