    "main_text": "Non-individuality and self-identity\n6. Metaphysical Underdetermination\n\n\nWe now appear to have an interesting situation. Quantum mechanics is\ncompatible with two distinct metaphysical \u2018packages\u2019, one\nin which the objects are regarded as individuals and one in which they\nare not. Thus, we have a form of \u2018underdetermination\u2019 of\nthe metaphysics by the physics (see van Fraassen 1985 and 1991; French\n1989; Huggett 1997). This has implications for the broader issue of\nrealism within the philosophy of science. If asked to spell out her\nbeliefs, the realist will point to currently accepted fundamental\nphysics, such as quantum mechanics, and insist that the world is, at\nleast approximately, however the physics says it is. Of course, there\nare the well-known problems of ontological change (giving rise to the\nso-called Pessimistic Meta-Induction) and Underdetermination of\nTheories by the Empirical data. However, this underdetermination of\nmetaphysical packages seems to pose an even more fundamental problem,\nas the physics involved is well entrenched and the difference in the\nmetaphysics seemingly as wide as it could be. These packages support\ndramatically different world-views: one in which quantum objects, such\nas electrons, quarks and so forth, are individuals and one in which\nthey are not. The realist must then face the question: which package\ncorresponds to the world? \n One option would be to refuse to answer and insist that all the\nrealist is required to do is to state how the world is, according to\nour best theories; that is, to articulate her realism in terms of\nelectrons, quarks etc. and what physics tells us about them and no\nmore, metaphysically speaking. This might be called a\n\u2018shallow\u2019 form of realism (Magnus 2012) and it raises the\nobvious worry that the content of such shallow realism amounts to no\nmore than a recitation of the relevant physical content of our best\ntheories, with no consideration of whether that content is concerned\nwith objects or not, and whether the former are individuals or\nnot. \n\n\nAt the other extreme, one might be tempted to give up realism\naltogether and adopt an anti-realist stance. Thus the constructive\nempiricist, taking realism to be metaphysically informed, and hence\n\u2018deep\u2019 rather than \u2018shallow\u2019, draws as the\nlesson from this underdetermination, \u2018so much for\nmetaphysics\u2019 and realism along with it. Since on this view, all\nthat theories can tell us is how the world could be, the\ndifferent metaphysical packages of objects-as-individuals and as\nnon-individuals simply amount to different ways of spelling that out\n(van Fraassen 1991). \n\nIn between these extremes are various options for handling the\nunderdetermination, corresponding to different levels of \u2018deep\u2019\nrealism. Thus one might try to argue that the underdetermination can\nbe \u2018broken\u2019 in some way. One might, for\nexample, appeal to some metaphysical factor or other in support of one\npackage over the other, or shift to meta-metaphysical considerations\nin order to argue, for example, that individuality based on weak\ndiscernibility has certain advantages over rival accounts and also\nover non-individuality, with its attendant non-standard formal\nunderpinning. However Arenhart argues that weak discernibility generates further metaphysical underdetermination and hence cannot support a fully naturalistic understanding of quantum mechanics as some of its advocates have claimed (Arenhart 2017b). Alternatively, of course, one could argue the other way\nand insist that the non-individuality package avoids having to choose between different\nmetaphysical accounts of individuality, at least, and that the formal\nshift to quasi-set theory is not as dramatic as might be\nthought. Ultimately, however, its not at all clear what weight should\nbe given to the various factors involved or even if a coherent\nweighting scheme can be applied in the first place.\n\nInstead one might appeal to broadly methodological factors to break\nthe underdetermination. Thus it has been argued that the package of\nobjects-as-non-individuals meshes better with quantum field theory\n(QFT) where, it is claimed, talk of individuals is avoided from the\nword go (Post 1963; Redhead and Teller 1991 and 1992; Teller\n1995). The central argument for this claim focuses on the core\nunderstanding that objects may indeed be regarded as individuals in\nquantum physics but as such are subject to restrictions on the sets of\nstates they may occupy. The states that are inaccessible to the\nparticles of a particular kind, such as electrons say, can be taken as\ncorresponding to just so much \u2018surplus structure\u2019. In\nparticular, if the view of particles as individuals is adopted, then\nit is entirely mysterious as to why a particular sub-set of these\ninaccessible, surplus states, namely those that are non-symmetric, are\nnot actually realised.  Applying the general methodological principle\nthat a theory which does not contain such surplus structure is to be\npreferred over one that does, Redhead and Teller conclude that we have\ngrounds for preferring the non-individuals package and the mystery of\nthe inaccessible states simply does not arise (Redhead and Teller 1991\nand 1992).\n\n\nThis line of argument has been criticised by Huggett on the grounds\nthat the apparent mystery is a mere fabrication: the inaccessible\nnon-symmetric states can be ruled out as simply not physically\npossible (Huggett 1995). The surplus structure, then, is a consequence\nof the representation chosen and has no further metaphysical\nsignificance. However, it has been insisted that a theory should also\ntell us why a particular state of affairs is not possible. So,\nconsider the possible state of affairs in which a cold cup of tea\nspontaneously starts to boil. Statistical mechanics can explain why we\nnever observe such a possibility, whereas the\nquantum-objects-as-individuals view cannot explain why we never\nobserve non-symmetric states and hence it is deficient in this regard\n(Teller 1998).\n\n\nUnfortunately, the analogy is problematic. Statistical mechanics does\nnot say that the above situation never occurs but only that the\nprobability of its occurrence is extremely low. The question then\nreduces to that of \u2018why is this probability so low?\u2019 The\nanswer to that is typically given in terms of the very low number of\nstates corresponding to the tea boiling compared to the vast number of\nstates for which it remains cold. Why, then, this disparity in the\nnumber of accessible states? Or, equivalently, why do we find\nourselves in situations in which entropy increases? One answer takes\nus back to the initial conditions of the Big Bang. A similar line can\nthen be taken in the case of quantum statistics. Why do we never\nobserve non-symmetric states? Because that is the way the universe is\nand we should not expect quantum mechanics alone to have to explain\nwhy certain initial conditions obtain and not others. Here we recall\nthat the symmetry of the Hamiltonian ensures that if a particle is in\na state of a particular symmetry (corresponding to Bose-Einstein\nstatistics, say, or Fermi-Dirac) to begin with, it will remain in\nstates of that symmetry. Hence, if non-symmetric states do not feature\nin the initial conditions which held at the beginning of the universe,\nthey will remain forever inaccessible to the particles. The issue then\nturns on different views of the significance of the above\n\u2018surplus structure\u2019 (see Belousek 2000.)\n\n\nFurthermore, even if we accept the methodological principle of\n\u2018the less surplus structure the better\u2019, it is not clear\nthat QFT understood in terms of non-individual \u2018quanta\u2019\noffers any significant advantage in this respect (although see da Costa and Holik 2015 for an account in these terms of states with undefined particle number, characteristic of QFT). Indeed, it has been\nargued that the formalism of QFT is also compatible with the alternative\npackage of objects as individuals. Van Fraassen has\npressed this claim (1991), drawing on de Muynck\u2019s construction of\nstate spaces for QFT which involve labelled particles\n(1975). Butterfield, however, has argued that the existence of\nstates that are superpositions of particle number, within QFT,\nundermines the equivalence (1993). Nevertheless, Huggett insists, in\nthis case the undermining is empirical, rather than methodological\n(Huggett 1995).  When the number is constant, it is the states for\narbitrary numbers of particles which are so much surplus structure and\nnow, if the methodological argument is applied, it is the individuals\npackage which is to be preferred.\n\nIt is also worth noting, perhaps, that some of this\n\u2018surplus\u2019 structure corresponds to so-called\n\u2018paraparticle\u2019 statistics, or forms of quantum statistics\nthat are neither bosonic nor fermionic. These were acknowledged as\npossible by Dirac as early as the 1930s but were only fully developed\ntheoretically from the late 1950s. For a brief period in the mid-1960s\nit was thought that quarks might be paraparticles, before the same\nstatistical behaviour came to be described in terms of the new\nintrinsic property of \u2018colour\u2019 leading to the development\nof quantum chromodynamics, which effectively pushed paraparticle\ntheory into the theoretical twilight (for a summary of the history see\nFrench and Krause 2006, Ch. 3; for a discussion of paraparticles in\nthe context of issues relating to particle indistinguishability, see\nCaulton and Butterfield 2012b). This suggests that paraparticle\nstatistics can always be re-described in conventional terms \u2013 a\nsuggestion that has been taken up by Baker et. al. in the context of\nalgebraic QFT, thereby eliminating this form of surplus structure at\nleast (Baker, Halvorson and Swanson 2015).\n\nThere remains considerable scope for further exploration of all these\nissues and concerns in the context of quantum field theory (see also\nAuyang 1995) and a collection of relevant historical and philosophical\nreflections can be found in Cao (1999).\n\nA further approach to this underdetermination is to reject both\npackages and seek a third way. Thus Morganti has argued that both of\nthe above metaphysical packages assume that everything qualitative\nabout an object must be encoded in terms of a property that it\npossesses (Morganti 2009). Dropping this assumption allows us to\nconsider quantum statistics as describing \u2018inherent\u2019\nproperties of the assembly as a whole. The (anti-)symmetry of the\nrelevant states is then accounted for in terms of the disposition of\nthe system to give rise to certain correlated outcomes upon\nmeasurement. This is presented as an extension of Teller\u2019s\n\u2018relational holism\u2019 (Teller 1989), and\nrelatedly, the notion of \u2018inherence\u2019 involves the denial\nof the supervenience of the properties of the whole on those of the\nparts.  However, as just indicated, it comes with a cost: that of\nadmitting holistic dispositional properties and the metaphysics of\nthese in the quantum context requires further development, as does the\nsense in which such inherent properties \u2018emerge\u2019 when\nsystems interact. Earlier and along similar metaphysical lines, Lavine\nsuggested that quantum objects can be regarded as the smallest\npossible amounts of \u2018stuff\u2019 and, crucially, that a\nmulti-particle state represents a further amount of stuff such that it\ndoes not contain proper parts (1991; see also Jantzen 2019). Such a view, he claims, avoids\nthe metaphysically problematic aspects of both the individuals and\nnon-individuals packages. Of course, there are then the issues of the\nmetaphysics and logic of \u2018stuff\u2019, but it can be argued\nthat these are familiar and not peculiar to quantum mechanics. One\nsuch issue concerns the nature of \u2018stuff\u2019: is it our\nfamiliar primitive substance?  Substance as a fundamental metaphysical\nprimitive faces well-known difficulties and it has been suggested that\nit should be dropped in favour of some form of \u2018bundle\ntheory\u2019, as mentioned at the very beginning of this article. If\nthe individual objects are understood to be bundles of\n\u2018tropes\u2019, where a trope is an individual instance of a\nproperty or a relation, and if this notion is broadened to include\nindividuals whose existence depends on that of others which are not a\npart of them then, it is claimed, this notion may be flexible enough\nto accommodate quantum physics (Simons 1998; see also Morganti\n2013). Another issue concerns the manner in which \u2018stuff\u2019\ncombines: how do we go from the amounts of stuff represented by two\nindependent photons, to the amount represented by a joint two-photon\nstate? The analogies Lavine gives are well known: drops of water,\nmoney in the bank, bumps on a rope (Teller 1983; Hesse 1963). Of\ncourse, these may also be appropriated by the non-individual objects\nview but, more significantly, they are suggestive of a field-theoretic\napproach in which the \u2018stuff\u2019 in question is the quantum\nfield. \n\n\nHere we return to issues concerning the metaphysics of quantum field\ntheory and it is worth pointing out that underdetermination may arise\nhere too. In classical physics we are faced with a choice between the\nview of the field as a kind of global substance or stuff and an\nalternative conception in terms of field quantities assigned to and\nhence as properties of, the points of space-time. In the case of\nquantum field theory, the field quantities are not well-defined at\nsuch points (because of difficulties in defining exact locational\nstates in quantum field theory) but are instead regarded as\n\u2018smeared\u2019 over space-time regions (see Teller 1999). The\nunderdetermination remains, of course: between an understanding of the\ngiven quantum field in terms of some kind of global substance and the\nalternative conception in terms of the properties of\nspace-time regions. Taking the first option obviously\nrequires a metaphysically articulated form of substantivalism\napplicable to quantum field theory. Many commentators have preferred\nthe second option, but now, of course, attention must be paid to the\nmetaphysical status of the space-time regions over which the field\nproperties are taken to be instantiated. Typically, these will be\ntaken to be composed of points of space-time and conceiving of a field\nin terms of a set of properties meshes comfortably with the approach\nthat takes space-time to be a kind of substance or \u2018stuff\u2019\nitself. But this too faces well known difficulties in the context of\nmodern physics (see, for example, Earman 1989). In particular,\nspace-time substantivalism has been argued to have extremely\nunpalatable consequences (Earman and Norton 1987). Unfortunately, such\na properties-based account of fields is difficult to reconcile with\nthe alternative view of space-time as merely a system of relations\n(such as contiguity) between physical bodies: if the field quantities\nare properties of space-time regions and the latter are understood,\nultimately, to be reducible to relations between physical objects,\nwhere the latter are conceived of in field-theoretic terms, then a\ncircularity arises (see Rovelli 1999). One way forward would be to\ndraw on alternative accounts of the nature of spacetime. Thus Stachel\nhas suggested that we drop the sharp,\nmetaphysical distinction between things and\nrelations between things and adopt a broadly\n\u2018structuralist\u2019 view of spacetime (Stachel 1999; see the\nessays in Rickles, French & Saatsi 2006). Suitably extended, such\na \u2018structuralist\u2019 approach might offer a way around the\nabove incompatibility by regarding both space-time and the quantum\nfield in structural terms, rather than in terms of substances,\nproperties or relations (see Auyang 1995; Cao 2003; French and Ladyman\n2003; Kantorovich 2003; Lyre 2004; Saunders 2003b).\n\nThis takes us to a further possible response to the above metaphysical\nunderdetermination which urges realism to retreat from a metaphysics\nof objects and develop an ontology of structure compatible with the\nphysics (Ladyman 1998 and 2014). An early attempt to do this in the\nquantum context can be seen in the work of Cassirer who noted the\nimplications of the new physics for the standard notion of individual\nobjects and concluded that quantum objects were describable only as\n\u2018\u201cpoints of intersection\u201d of certain\nrelations\u2019 (1937, p. 180) Setting aside the neo-Kantian elements\nin Cassirer\u2019s structuralism, this view of quantum entities has been\ndeveloped in the context of a form of \u2018ontic\u2019 structural realism\n(Ladyman and Ross 2007). Drawing on the views\nof both Weyl and Wigner, quantum objects are here understood as\nontologically constituted, group theoretically, in terms of sets of\ninvariants, such as rest mass, charge, spin, and so on (Castellani\n1998a). From this perspective, both the individuality and\nnon-individuality packages get off on the wrong feet, as it were, by\nassuming that the way the world is, according to physics, is a world\nof objects, which can either be regarded as individuals, whether\nprimitively or via weak discernibility, or as non-individuals, whether\nformally represented through quasi-set theory or not. \n\nHow, then, should we regard the \u2018Indistinguishability Postulate\u2019 with which we began this discussion of identity and individuality in the quantum context? Both the above packages rest upon a certain understanding of particle permutations, as encapsulated in that  Postulate, namely that these are to be conceived in terms of swapping the particles  between states, or boxes in our illustrative sketch. However, we can also think of the \u2018Indistinguishability Postulate\u2019 as expressing a fundamental symmetry constraint on quantum mechanics, to the effect that the relevant states should be invariant under particle permutations. An alternative way of regarding this \u2018permutation invariance\u2019 that aligns with a widely accepted view of symmetry principles in general is that it expresses a certain representational redundancy in the formalism. Thus, referring to our sketch above, the permuted arrangement of one particle in each box, which is counted in classical statistical mechanics but not in the quantum form, can be considered as \u2018representationally redundant\u2019 in this sense. This casts \u2018permutation invariance\u2019 as one of a number of such symmetry principles that have acquired a fundamental role in modern physics (Huggett 1999b; French and Rickles 2003). Not surprisingly perhaps, such a re-casting may also have metaphysical implications in that when applied to certain systems obeying Fermi-Dirac statistics \u2013 that is, systems of \u2018material\u2019 particles \u2013 the composition of such systems (in the sense that they may be regarded as composed or made up of sub-systems considered as \u2018parts\u2019) violates standard mereological principles (Caulton 2015; for some possible responses see Bigaj 2016). More generally it has been argued that \u2018permutation invariance\u2019 is incompatible with a particle ontology understood even in a metaphysically minimal sense (Jantzen 2011). Given the fundamental significance of the former, it has been suggested that the latter must then be jettisoned. A possible alternative is to adopt a form of space-time substantivalism and take property-bearing regions of space-time to provide the appropriate ontological basis (Jantzen 2011). However that runs into the sorts of problems touched on above.\n\nMore radically, perhaps, dropping the above \u2018object-oriented\u2019\nassumption would undercut the metaphysical underdetermination entirely and open up space for an alternative ontology in terms of which quantum entities are conceived of as nothing more than\nfeatures of \u2018the structure of the world\u2019 (see French and Ladyman 2003). This can then be articulated in terms of the relevant laws and symmetries with the properties of such putative entities understood as the determinate aspects of this structure (see French 2014; for further consideration of such an ontology in the context of \u2018structural realism\u2019, see Ladyman 2014).\n",
