Back-and-Forth Games\n\nIn 1930 Alfred Tarski formulated the notion of two structures \\(A\\)\nand \\(B\\) being elementarily equivalent, i.e., that exactly\nthe same first-order sentences are true in \\(A\\) as are true in \\(B\\).\nAt a conference in Princeton in 1946 he described this notion and\nexpressed the hope that it would be possible to develop a theory of it\nthat would be \u2018as deep as the notions of isomorphism, etc. now\nin use\u2019 (Tarski 1946). \n\nOne natural part of such a theory would be a purely structural\nnecessary and sufficient condition for two structures to be\nelementarily equivalent. Roland Fra\u00efss\u00e9, a\nFrench-Algerian, was the first to find a usable necessary and\nsufficient condition. It was rediscovered a few years later by the\nKazakh logician A. D. Taimanov, and it was reformulated in terms of\ngames by the Polish logician Andrzej Ehrenfeucht. The games are now\nknown as Ehrenfeucht-Fra\u00efss\u00e9 games, or sometimes\nas back-and-forth games. They have turned out to be one of\nthe most versatile ideas in twentieth-century logic. They adapt\nfruitfully to a wide range of logics and structures.\n\nIn a back-and-forth game there are two structures \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), and\ntwo players who are commonly called Spoiler and Duplicator. (The names\nare due to Joel Spencer in the early 1990s. More recently Neil\nImmerman suggested Samson and Delilah, using the same initials; this\nplaces Spoiler as the male player \\(\\forall\\) and Duplicator as the\nfemale \\(\\exists\\).) Each step in the game consists of a move of\nSpoiler, followed by a move of Duplicator. Spoiler chooses an element\nof one of the two structures, and Duplicator must then choose an\nelement of the other structure. So after \\(n\\) steps, two sequences\nhave been chosen, one from \\(A\\) and one from \\(B\\): \n\n\\[\n(a_0 ,\\ldots ,a_{n-1} ; b_0,\\ldots ,b_{n-1}).\n\\]\n\n\nThis position is a win for Spoiler if and only if some atomic formula\n(of one of the forms \u2018\\(\\R(v_0 ,\\ldots ,v_{k-1})\\)\u2019 or\n\u2018\\(\\mathrm{F}(v_0 ,\\ldots ,v_{k-1}) = v_k\\)\u2019 or\n\u2018\\(v_0 =v_1\\)\u2019, or one of these with different variables)\nis satisfied by \\((a_0 ,\\ldots ,a_{n-1})\\) in \\(A\\) but not by \\((b_0\n,\\ldots ,b_{n-1})\\) in \\(B\\), or vice versa. The condition for\nDuplicator to win is different in different forms of the game. In the\nsimplest form, \\(\\EF(A, B)\\), a play is a win for Duplicator if and\nonly if no initial part of it is a win for Spoiler (i.e. she wins if\nshe hasn\u2019t lost by any finite stage). For each natural number\n\\(m\\) there is a game \\(\\EF_m (A, B)\\); in this game Duplicator wins\nafter \\(m\\) steps provided she has not yet lost. All these games are\ndetermined, by the Gale-Stewart Theorem. The two structures \\(A\\) and\n\\(B\\) are said to be back-and-forth equivalent if Duplicator\nhas a winning strategy for \\(\\EF(A, B)\\), and m-equivalent if\nshe has a winning strategy for \\(\\EF_m (A, B)\\).\n\nOne can prove that if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are \\(m\\)-equivalent for every\nnatural number \\(m\\), then they are elementarily equivalent. In fact,\nif Eloise has a winning strategy \\(\\tau\\) in the Hintikka game\nG\\((\\phi)\\) on \\(A\\), where the nesting of quantifier scopes of\n\\(\\phi\\) has at most m levels and Duplicator has a winning strategy\n\\(\\varrho\\) in the game \\(\\EF_m (A, B)\\), the two strategies \\(\\tau\\)\nand \\(\\varrho\\) can be composed into a winning strategy of Eloise in\nG\\((\\phi)\\) on \\(B\\). On the other hand a winning strategy for Spoiler\nin \\(\\EF_m (A, B)\\) can be converted into a first-order sentence that\nis true in exactly one of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), and in which the nesting of\nquantifier scopes has at most \\(m\\) levels. So we have our necessary\nand sufficient condition for elementary equivalence, and a bit more\nbesides.\n\nIf \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are back-and-forth equivalent, then certainly they\nare elementarily equivalent; but in fact back-and-forth equivalence\nturns out to be the same as elementary equivalence in an\n infinitary logic\n which is much more expressive than first-order logic. There are many\nadjustments of the game that give other kinds of equivalence. For\nexample Barwise, Immerman and Bruno Poizat independently described a\ngame in which the two players have exactly \\(p\\) numbered pebbles\neach; each player has to label his or her choices with a pebble, and\nthe two choices in the same step must be labelled with pebbles\ncarrying the same number. As the game proceeds, the players will run\nout of pebbles and so they will have to re-use pebbles that were\nalready used. The condition for Spoiler to win at a position (and all\nsubsequent positions) is the same as before, except that only the\nelements carrying labels at that position count. The existence of a\nwinning strategy for Duplicator in this game means that the two\nstructures agree for sentences which use at most \\(p\\) variables\n(allowing these variables to occur any number of times).\n\nThe theory behind back-and-forth games uses very few assumptions about\nthe logic in question. As a result, these games are one of the few\nmodel-theoretic techniques that apply as well to finite structures as\nthey do to infinite ones, and this makes them one of the cornerstones\nof theoretical computer science. One can use them to measure the\nexpressive strength of formal languages, for example database query\nlanguages. A typical result might say, for example, that a certain\nlanguage can\u2019t distinguish between \u2018even\u2019 and\n\u2018odd\u2019; we would prove this by finding, for each level\n\\(n\\) of complexity of formulas of the language, a pair of finite\nstructures for which Duplicator has a winning strategy in the\nback-and-forth game of level \\(n\\), but one of the structures has an\neven number of elements and the other has an odd number. Semanticists\nof natural languages have found back-and-forth games useful for\ncomparing the expressive powers of\n generalised quantifiers.\n (See for example Peters and Westerst\u00e5hl 2006 Section IV.)\n\nThere is also a kind of back-and-forth game that corresponds to our\nmodal semantics above in the same way as\nEhrenfeucht-Fra\u00efss\u00e9 games correspond to Hintikka\u2019s\ngame semantics for first-order logic. The players start with a state\n\\(s\\) in the structure \\(A\\) and a state \\(t\\) in the structure \\(B\\).\nSpoiler and Duplicator move alternately, as before. Each time he\nmoves, Spoiler chooses whether to move in \\(A\\) or in \\(B\\), and then\nDuplicator must move in the other structure. A move is always made by\ngoing forwards along an arrow from the current state. If between them\nthe two players have just moved to a state \\(s\\)\u00b4 in \\(A\\) and a\nstate \\(t\\)\u00b4 in \\(B\\), and some predicate \\(P_i\\) holds at just\none of \\(s\\)\u00b4 and \\(t\\)\u00b4, then Duplicator loses at once.\nAlso she loses if there are no available arrows for her to move along;\nbut if Spoiler finds there are no available arrows for him to move\nalong in either structure, then Duplicator wins. If the two players\nplay this game with given starting states \\(s\\) in \\(A\\) and \\(t\\) in\n\\(B\\), and both structures have just finitely many states, then one\ncan show that Duplicator has a winning strategy if and only if the\nsame modal sentences are true at \\(s\\) in \\(A\\) as are true at \\(t\\)\nin \\(B\\).\n\nThere are many generalisations of this result, some of them involving\nthe following notion. Let \\(Z\\) be a binary relation which relates\nstates of \\(A\\) to states of \\(B\\). Then we call \\(Z\\) a\nbisimulation between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) if Duplicator can use\n\\(Z\\) as a nondeterministic winning strategy in the back-and-forth\ngame between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) where the first pair of moves of the two\nplayers is to choose their starting states. In computer science the\nnotion of a bisimulation is crucial for the understanding of \\(A\\) and\n\\(B\\) as systems; it expresses that the two systems interact with\ntheir environment in the same way as each other, step for step. But a\nlittle before the computer scientists introduced the notion,\nessentially the same concept appeared in Johan van Benthem\u2019s PhD\nthesis on the semantics of modal logic (1976).\n",
