    "main_text": "Ethics || Virtue Theory\n9. Influence\n\nDuring his lifetime, Aquinas was recognized as an extraordinary figure\nboth for his intellectual achievements and for his personal sanctity.\nThe immense number of surviving manuscripts and the wide range of his\ninfluence testifies to the first. As for the second, his death in\nFossanova immediately gave rise to the sort of veneration reserved for\nthe saints: claims of miracles at once arose, and a long-running\ndispute began over where the holy relic of his body would be kept.\nThis process culminated in his canonization on July 18, 1323.\n\nThese developments notwithstanding, many of Aquinas\u2019s specific\nviews\u2014particularly in philosophy\u2014were extremely\ncontroversial. Among the 219 articles condemned in Paris in 1277 are a\nsignificant number that seem to implicate Aquinas\u2019s teachings\n(Hissette 1977; Wippel 1995b). It would have been lost on no one at\nthe time that these articles were promulgated three years, to the day,\nafter his death. It seems likely that the authorities in Paris were\nplanning an explicit censure of certain of Aquinas\u2019s core\ntheses\u2014especially his unitarian theory of substantial form\n(\u00a75) and his conception of prime matter as pure potentiality\n(\u00a74)\u2014until higher authorities cut this process short\n(Torrell 1993 [2022] ch. 16). Later in March 1277, in Oxford,\nArchbishop\n Robert Kilwardby\n condemned a series of theses that explicitly includes those two\ndistinctively Aquinian doctrines. Also around this time, the\nFranciscan William de la Mare published a lengthy Correctorium\nfratris Thomae, with verbatim quotations from Aquinas\u2019s\ncorpus paired with putative \u201ccorrections\u201d. Soon after,\nvarious disciples of Aquinas rallied to his defense, in a series of\nworks entitled the Correctorium Corruptorii Thomae (Glorieux\n1927; Jordan 1982). For the quarter century after Aquinas\u2019s\ndeath, scholasticism took shape around his Dominican supporters and\nhis Franciscan critics.\n\nIn the early fourteenth century, Aquinas\u2019s influence had to\ncompete against the emergence of two brilliantly original Franciscans:\nfirst Scotus and his expansive realism; then\n William Ockham\n and his parsimonious nominalism. In the face of these and many other\ncomplex crosscurrents, Aquinas\u2019s views came to seem both less\nurgent and less dangerous. Two years after his canonization, the\nbishop of Paris clarified that the 1277 condemnations should not be\nheld to apply to Aquinas\u2019s teaching, though the bishop made\nclear that this should not be taken as an endorsement. Among the many\nemerging rival views, Aquinas continued to have his vociferous\nsupporters, particularly among the Dominicans, who were statutorily\nrequired to promote his teaching. In the early fifteenth century, John\nCapreolus emerged as a champion of Thomism as a systematic philosophy,\nand a century later Cajetan (Thomas de Vio) made further systematic\ndevelopments. In 1567, Pope Pius V numbered Aquinas among the doctors\nof the Church, a title previously reserved for the ancient Church\nfathers. When the Jesuit order came to prominence, around this same\ntime, its members\u2014including\n Francisco Su\u00e1rez\u2014were\n enjoined to adhere to those views that were safest and best\nestablished, and especially to those of Aquinas, \u201cbecause of his\nauthority and his more secure and approved teachings\u201d (Pasnau\n2011, 436).\n\nEven as Thomism gradually became ascendant within scholastic\nAristotelianism, that whole tradition started to look more and more\nhidebound, as it moved into its increasingly mannerist and then\nbaroque stages.\n Martin Luther\u2019s\n hostility toward the Roman Catholic Church mirrored his hostility\ntoward scholastic philosophy and theology: \u201csoon no Thomist,\nAlbertist, Scotist, or Ockhamist will be left in the world, but all\nwill be simple children of God and true Christians\u201d (Oberman\n1966, 18\u201319). The Italian humanists attacked from a different\ndirection, prizing historical scholarship over intricate metaphysics.\nBy the seventeenth century,\n Thomas Hobbes\n and his contemporaries flaunted their scorn for the scholastics, who\n\u201cconverse in questions of matters incomprehensible\u201d\n(Leviathan viii.27). It would not be until the eighteenth\ncentury, however, that these \u201cmoderns\u201d began to drive the\nThomists and other scholastics out of the universities. (On the\nreception of Aquinas over the centuries see Levering and Plested\n2021.)\n\nIn 1879, Pope Leo XIII called for a revival in the study and teaching\nof Aquinas. One fruit of this encyclical was the founding of the\ndefinitive Leonine edition of Aquinas\u2019s work. Another was a\nrenewal of the old Thomistic picture of Aquinas as standing at the\nsummit of philosophical and theological achievement, leaving\nsubsequent developments\u2014from Scotus to Descartes, Kant and\nbeyond\u2014to be dismissed as just so much decline and decay. Such\nzeal was hardly likely to be sustained for long, however, and the\ntwentieth century witnessed a flourishing of Thomisms of all kinds, in\nscholars like\n Jacques Maritain,\n Etienne Gilson,\n Elizabeth Anscombe,\n and Alasdair MacIntyre. As more recent scholarship has deepened our\nunderstanding both of Aquinas and of his successors, we now have a\nmuch fuller picture of the richness of later medieval philosophy.\nAquinas today, viewed as a philosopher, looks not so much like the\nculmination of an era, but rather like the brilliant beginning of\nEurope\u2019s philosophical renaissance.\n",
