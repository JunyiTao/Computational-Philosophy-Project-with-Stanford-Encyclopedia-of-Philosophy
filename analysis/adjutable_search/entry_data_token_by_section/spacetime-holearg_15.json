That it embodies non-trivial\nassumptions whose import must be accepted with sober reflection is\nindicated by the early acceptance of the hole argument by none other\nthan David Hilbert himself. (See\n Section 8.2\n above.) If denial of Leibniz Equivalence is a blunder so egregious\nthat no competent mathematician would make it, then our standards for\ncompetence have become unattainably high, for they must exclude David\nHilbert in 1915 at the height of his powers.\n\nThe question has nevertheless been reopened recently by Weatherall\n(2018), who aargues that intertransformable mathematical structures\nare taken in standard mathematical practice to be the same structure.\nThus they should represent the same physical system, precluding the\ndenial of Leibniz Equivalence. Curiel (2018) argues for a similar\ntriviality conclusion as Weatherall but on a different basis: there is\nno physical correlate to the hole transformation in standard\nphysical practice. For a response to arguments of this kind, defending\nthe view that this kind of \u2018mathematical structuralism\u2019 is\ninsufficient to block the hole argument, see Pooley & Read (2021);\nlikewise, Roberts (2020) has responded that Nature\u2014not\nmathematical practice\u2014should decide whether two mathematical\nstructures represent the same physical system.\n\nRecently, some authors have argued that modifying the foundations of\nmathematics from the set-theoretic orthodoxy would be sufficient to\nblock the hole argument: see Ladyman & Presnell (2020) and\nDougherty (2020) for discussions of such arguments in the particular\ncontext of homotopy type theory. Separately, Halvorson and Manchak\n(2021) have argued that because there is a unique metric-preserving\nmap (\u2018isometry\u2019) relating two solutions of general\nrelativity related by the hole transformation, the hole argument is\nthereby blocked; for sceptical responses to this argument, see Menon\n& Read (2023).\n\nBelot (2018) argues against a single decision univocally in favor or\ncontrary to Leibniz Equivalence. While allowing that hole\ntransformations relate systems that are physically the same, he argues\nthat in some sectors of general relativity, some transformations that\npreserve the metric may relate physically distinct systems.\n",
