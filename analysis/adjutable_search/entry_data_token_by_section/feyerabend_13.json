    "main_text": "Feyerabend\u2019s Early Work: Liberalizing Empiricism || The Late Sixties\n4.4 The Late Sixties\n\nDuring the summer of 1966, Feyerabend lectured on church dogma at\nBerkeley. (\u201cWhy church dogma? Because the development of church\ndogma shares many features with the development of scientific\nthought\u201d (pp. 137\u20138)). He eventually turned these thoughts\ninto a paper on \u201cClassical Empiricism\u201d, published in 1970,\nin which he argued that empiricism shared certain problematic features\nwith protestantism. He had already come some way from his 1965 defence\nof a \u201cdisinfected\u201d, \u201ctolerant\u201d form of\nEmpiricism. The publication, in 1969, of the four-page article,\n\u201cScience Without Experience\u201d, which argued that in\nprinciple experience is necessary at no point in the\nconstruction, comprehension or testing of empirical scientific\ntheories finally gave notice that Feyerabend was no longer concerned\nto present himself as any kind of empiricist. \n\nDespite taking his academic duties and responsibilities decreasingly\nseriously, and coming into conflict with his own university\u2019s\nadministration as a result, Feyerabend had not yet fouled his\nsubstantial reputation as a serious philosopher of science. He reports\nthat he received job offers from London, Berlin, Yale, and Auckland,\nthat he was invited to become a fellow of All Souls College, Oxford,\nand that he corresponded with Friedrich von Hayek (whom he already\nknew from the Alpbach seminars) about a job in Freiburg (p. 127). He\naccepted the posts in London, Berlin, and Yale. In 1968, he resigned\nfrom UC Berkeley and left for Minneapolis, but grew homesick, got\nre-appointed, and returned to Berkeley almost immediately.\n\nIn London, lecturing to University College and the LSE, he met Imre\nLakatos. The two became great friends, corresponding with one another\nregularly and voluminously until Lakatos\u2019 death. Feyerabend\nrecalls that Lakatos, whose office was across the corridor from the\nLSE lecture hall, used to intervene in his lectures when Feyerabend\nmade a point he disagreed with (SFS, p. 13, KT, p.\n128).\n",
