    "main_text": "The Early-Scholastic Tradition || Peter Lombard: The Scholastic Origins of the Debate\n2.1 Peter Lombard: The Scholastic Origins of the Debate\n\nPeter Lombard\u2019s role in the evolution of the concept of\nconscience is both surprising and unsurprising. It is\u2014at first\nsight, anyway\u2014surprising because Lombard does not discuss\nconscience or synderesis in any actual detail. Indeed, he does not,\nstrictly speaking, mention the terms \u201csynderesis\u201d or\n\u201cconscience\u201d at all. What he does is merely to allude to\nJerome\u2019s commentary on Ezekiel in the context of\ndiscussing the will\u2019s role in how rational agents can naturally\nwant what is good while simultaneously being slaves to sin (Peter\nLombard, Sententiae in IV libros distinctae, 2.39; Potts\n1980: 92). In St. Paul\u2019s reference to moral weakness in Romans\n7:15, he famously says: \u201cFor I do not do what I want but do what\nI do not want\u201d. Is Paul suggesting, asks Lombard, that we have\ntwo separate wills: one naturally oriented towards the good and\nanother oriented towards sin? Or is it rather the case that we have a\nsingle will that, although naturally inclined to the good, contains a\ndefect which also \u201ctakes pleasure in what is evil\u201d\n(Sententiae in IV libros distinctae, 2.39; Potts 1980: 93)?\nAmongst those who hold the first view, the motivating power that\norients us towards the good is called the \u201cnatural\u201d will,\nwhile the inclination towards sin resulting from the Fall is called\n\u201cfree will\u201d (or \u201cfree choice\u201d). With respect\nto the former, Peter writes:\n\n\nFor some say that there are two motivations, one by which a man\nnaturally wants what is good. Why naturally? And why is it called\n\u201cnatural\u201d? Because such was the motivation of human nature\nin its original state, in which we were created without any defect,\nand this is properly called \u201cnature\u201d. For man was created\nwith a righteous will [\u2026] Man is therefore rightly said\nnaturally to want what is good, because he was constructed with a good\nand righteous will. For the higher spark of reason (superior enim\nscintilla rationis) which, as Jerome says, \u201ccould not even\nbe extinguished in Cain\u201d, always wants what is good and hates\nwhat is bad. (Peter Lombard, Sententiae in IV libros\ndistinctae, 2.39; Potts trans. 1980: 92\u201393)\n\n\nLombard\u2019s brief mention of Jerome\u2019s \u201cspark of\nreason\u201d (sic) in the aforementioned passage is the full extent\nof his treatment of conscience and synderesis. Still, that was\nsufficient to ensure that it would receive robust attention by later\nscholastics, who would track down the original text from Jerome in\norder to comment on it. A compilation of theological writings taken\nmainly from Scripture and the Fathers and arranged in systematic\nfashion, the Sentences had an enormous impact on later\ntheological enquiry since much it, after the 1220s, was carried out\nwithin the taxonomy that Lombard had laid out in his work. Indeed,\nafter Alexander of Hales (1185\u20131245) adopted the\nSentences as the main source for his ordinary lectures at\nParis in 1222, and Richard Fischacre (1206\u20131248) did the same at\nOxford in 1245, lecturing on the Sentences became a\nrequirement for every aspiring master of theology. Thus did such major\nscholastics of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries as Bonaventure\n(1221\u20131274), Thomas Aquinas (1224/25\u20131274), John Duns\nScotus (1265\u20131308) and William of Ockham (1287\u20131347) come\nto write their important commentaries on the work. This tradition\nwould continue well into the sixteenth century.\n\nConsisting of four books, each subdivided into chapters, the\nSentences follows the distinction that Saint Augustine had\ndrawn in the De doctrina Christiana between the things that\nare real and the signs that lead us back to the former. Book one\ntreats of God, who is really real, and his triune nature. Book two\ndeals with creation and the fall, including human nature, treating\nthese as signs that point back to God. Book three treats of Christ,\nwho is the antidote to the fall, and who, as God incarnate, is both\nthing and sign. Finally, book four treats of the sacraments, which are\nsigns that assist the fallen in their return to God: the ultimate\nreality. Since book two deals with human moral psychology in the\ncontext of creation and the fall, it is here, in distinction 39, that\nPeter Lombard\u2019s mention of Jerome\u2019s commentary on\nEzekiel is found.\n\nSince Lombard\u2019s treatment of Jerome was partial and elliptical,\nlater thinkers, in composing their commentaries on the\nSentences, naturally turned to Jerome\u2019s text in order\nto scrutinize the original passage. There, they discovered his\napparent distinction between synderesis and conscience, which in turn\nwould come to frame the parameters of the later medieval debate. If\nsynderesis and conscience are in fact two separate parts of the soul,\nfor instance, what is their relationship to one another? What, come to\nthat, are their respective natures and, rather importantly, can they\nbecome disordered? Such questions would preoccupy the theologians of\nthe later Middle Ages.\n",
