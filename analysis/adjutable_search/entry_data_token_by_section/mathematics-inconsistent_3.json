    "main_text": "Geometrical Inconsistency\n4. Geometrical Inconsistency\n\nA geometrical development is the application to explaining the\nphenomenon of inconsistent pictures. The best known of these are\nperhaps M. C. Escher\u2019s masterpieces Belvedere,\nWaterfall and Ascending and Descending. In fact the\ntradition goes back millennia to Pompeii. Escher seems to have derived\nmany of his intuitions from the Swedish artist Oscar Reutersv\u00e4rd,\nwho began his inconsistent work in 1934. Escher also actively\ncollaborated with the English mathematician Roger Penrose. There have\nbeen several attempts to describe the mathematical structure of\ninconsistent pictures using classical consistent mathematics, by\ntheorists such as Cowan, Francis and Penrose. As argued in Mortensen\n(1997), however, no consistent mathematical theory can capture the\nsense that one is seeing an impossible thing. Only an inconsistent\ntheory can capture the content of that perception. This amounts to an\nappeal to a cognitive justification of paraconsistency. One can then\nproceed to display inconsistent theories which are candidates for such\ninconsistent contents. There is an analogy with classical mathematics\non this point: projective geometry is a classical consistent\nmathematical theory which is interesting because we are creatures with\nan eye, since it explains why it is that things look the way they do\nin perspective.\n\nInconsistent geometrical studies are further developed in Mortensen\n(2002a), where category theory is applied to give a general\ndescription of the relationships between the various theories and\ntheir consistent cut-downs and incomplete duals. For an informal\naccount which highlights the difference between visual\n\u201cparadoxes\u201d and the philosophically more common paradoxes\nof language, such as the Liar, see Mortensen (2002b).\n\nMore recently, inconsistent mathematical descriptions have been\nobtained for several classes of inconsistent figures, exemplified by\nEscher\u2019s Cube (found in his print Belvedere), the\nReutersv\u00e4rd-Penrose triangle, and others. See Mortensen\n(2010).\n\nThis raises another interesting issue. Ever since Euclid, the method\nof reductio ad absurdum has been thoroughly exploited in geometrical\nproofs (assume he opposite of what you want to prove and deduce a\ncontradiction). But here we have a different technique (employ a\ncontradiction to describe how inconsistent figures look, to\ndemonstrate that the content is genuinely contradictory). If\nsuccessful, this is a demonstration that human conceptualisation\nexceeds the merely possible (consistent). For discussion see Mortensen\n(2019, 2022).\n\nOne more point: do these geometrical paradoxes lend support to full\ndialetheism? The answer is no. If you can draw a contradictory picture\nthen something exists that is inconsistent. And, distinct\ninconsistent figures imply distinctions between types of\ncontradictions which ECQ does not permit. But this should not be\npushed too far. Nothing says that because a picture has a content,\nthat content must somehow be true: many pictures are\nfictional in content. For more on this theme see Mortensen\n(2019a).\n",
