    "main_text": "Hellenistic Philosophies and Politics || Stoicism\n5.3 Stoicism\n\nWhile Epicurus held that the sage would not engage in politics except\nin \u201csome special circumstance,\u201d Zeno, the founder of the\nStoic school (see the entry on\n Stoicism),\n held rather that a true sage \u201cwill engage in politics unless\nsomething prevents it\u201d (Seneca, De Otio 3.2, as\ntranslated and quoted in Sharples 1996: 124; SVF 1.271). As\nwe shall see, a Stoic commitment to politics generally took it to be\npart of nature\u2019s rational plan for human happiness, though this\nwas not incompatible with a Cynic tincture of questioning whether\nexisting laws are truly in accordance with the natural law (Vogt\n2008). The question however of the nature of the polity in which\npolitics was to be exercised remains contested as a matter of the\ninterpretation of various Stoic figures, who across the lifetime of\nthe school encompassed both the early generation of the school\u2019s\nleaders (Zeno and his successor Chrysippus) and later figures thriving\nin the Roman period who wrote variously in Greek and in Latin (for an\noverview, see Laurand 2005). To be sure, the polity in question was\ninvariably figured as a city, according to the account given in Dio\nChrysostom (36.20: \u201c They [the Stoics] say that a city is a\ngroup of people living in the same place and administered by\nlaw\u201d (SVF 3.329, as translated in LS 67J). But which\npeople? Whether the members of this city were to be all humans\ntogether with the gods, or only human sages and the gods, and whether\nthe city is to be envisaged as a distinct foundation or as identical\nwith the cosmos, has much exercised both Stoic thinkers and subsequent\ninterpreters. And which law? How does or should the law of a\nparticular city relate to the natural law? These questions are\ncanvassed further as this section unfolds.\n\nBoth Zeno and Chrysippus wrote works in the Platonic genre entitled\nRepublic, neither of which survives in full. (So too,\nreportedly, had Diogenes the Cynic.) Zeno\u2019s was written as a\nyoung man, allegedly under Cynic influence, rejecting the use of money\nin the characteristic Cynic vein. His portrait of the republic\ncombines the Stoic idea of a natural law by which human conduct is\nharmonized with cosmic order, with a classical vision of politics in\nwhich a Platonic ideal of friendship through communist and sexual\nbonding (more erotic than familial for Zeno) persists (following\nSchofield 1991: 22\u201356). He seems to have adopted Plato\u2019s\nprescription for the community of women and children, and at least\nsome aspects of his insistence on the potential civic equality of men\nand women and political irrelevance of their anatomical differences.\nHumans share many characteristics and tendencies with other animals,\nand their initial impulse to form into society is a social rather than\nstrictly political one: they are animated by a tendency to associate\nwith those akin to themselves (the Stoic notion of\noikei\u00f4sis).\n\nSuch a social tendency is, according to what is reported of the\nopening of Chrysippus\u2019 lost treatise On Law,\ntransformed into a political relationship by means of law: \u201cLaw\nis king of all things human and divine. Law must preside over what is\nhonourable and base, as ruler and as guide, and thus be the standard\nof right and wrong, prescribing to animals whose nature is political\nwhat they should do, and prohibiting them from what they should not\ndo\u201d (SVF 3.314, as translated in LS 67R). Yet, in\nkeeping with some tendencies in Platonism and Cynicism, such law might\nhave to be radically different from existing laws if it is to be in\nfull conformity with nature and reason. For Chrysippus, even certain\nforms of incest are said to have been \u201cdiscredited without\nreason\u201d (SVF 3.753, as translated in LS 67F): a\ncomparison with animals would license them.\n\nPlutarch\u2019s characterization of Zeno\u2019s Republic as\nprescribing that \u201cwe should regard all men as our\nfellow-citizens and local residents\u201d (SVF 1.262, as\ntranslated in LS 67A), composed around the end of the first century of\nthe Common Era, has often been read as prescribing a kind of\ncosmopolitanism that builds on Diogenes\u2019 paradoxical Cynic\nversion of that stance. However, the reliability of this text as an\naccount of Zeno has been questioned, and just how this fellowship of\nall humans relates to the fellowship of rationally perfect sages and\nto the sharing of humans and gods in the cosmos has been debated (for\na defense and interpretation of Plutarch\u2019s claim as applying to\nall humans, see Vogt 2008: 86\u201390, contra the views of Schofield\n1991 and Vander Waerdt\n 1991).[11]\n Arguably, as in the case of Aristotle, the underlying kinship by\nnature establishes a potential for a full civic membership which is to\nbe based solely on virtue, itself potentially available to all\nrational beings but realized in practice by few or perhaps even none.\nThis is one interpretation of the report that Zeno presented\n\u201conly virtuous people in the Republic as citizens,\nfriends, relations and free\u201d (as translated in LS 67B; this is\npreserved in Diogenes Laertius 7.32\u20137.33, found in SVF\n1.226 and 1.222 respectively).\n\nEspecially for the early Stoics, existing cities remained an accepted\narena both for political action in practice\u2014Stoic sages and\nscholars advising kings and serving in offices (SVF 3.686;\ntranslated in LS 67W)\u2014insofar as the notion of a distinctive\nindividual city remained the principal framework for defining the\nnature of politics in terms of justice. Yet the role of natural law\nalready in the early Stoics, and certainly in later ones, came to\nsupport an alternative horizon for politics on the scale of the cosmos\nas a whole (Laurand 2005). Malcolm Schofield (1991: 103) has argued\nthat this development \u201cmediates the transition from\nrepublicanism to natural law theory,\u201d so bequeathing a crucial\nresource to early modern thinkers who sought to construct new versions\nof the latter. Meanwhile, in the years of the Roman republic, certain\naffinities between Stoic and republican ideas proved significant, as\nwe shall now see.\n",
