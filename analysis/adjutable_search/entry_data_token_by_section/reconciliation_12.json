    "main_text": "Reconciliation and Justice\n4. Reconciliation and Justice\n\nWrongdoing has implications for multiple moral values, including, most\nfundamentally, justice. Justice-based concerns traditionally dominate\nphilosophical discussions of responding to wrongdoing. What is the\nrelationship between justice and reconciliation? Discussion of this\nquestion occurs most explicitly in the political context, especially\nin debates about the moral justifiability of non-punitive responses to\nwrongdoing such as truth commissions. This section provides an\noverview of the various positions that have been advanced concerning\nthe relationship between justice and reconciliation.\n\nWhether reconciliation is compatible with justice turns, of course, on\nhow one conceives of justice. In some parts of the literature, the\nquestion concerns corrective justice. For example, critics object to\ncalls for reconciliation that are not accompanied with restitution for\nharms suffered, such as the appropriation of land (Alfred 2009). In\nsection 3.7, we describe how, in other cases, restitution and\nreparation are defended as a means to reconciliation. However, as\nHoward McGary (2010 argues, here too there is a tension between\njustice and reconciliation. Principles of restitution are generally\ntaken to be backward-looking, in the sense that the past action of\nwrongful taking itself provides sufficient grounds for making the\nvictims whole. Bringing in the rhetoric of reconciliation suggests\ninstead that the reason for the transfer of goods is to secure better\nfuture relations among wrongdoers and victims. McGary argues that this\nforward-looking goal of reconciliation can insultingly suggest that a\nconcern for corrective justice is an insufficient reason to compensate\nthe victim--that justice for these victims is only worth securing when\nit is also in the interest of the wrongdoers.\n\nFor many other theorists, especially those writing about transitional\ncontexts, justice is assumed to be \u2018retributive justice\u2019\n(see the entry on\n retributive justice).\n The core claim of retributivists is that perpetrators of wrongdoing\ndeserve to suffer a proportional punishment. Justice is a matter of\nholding wrongdoers accountable by giving them the negative treatment\nthey deserve.\n\nAgainst this background, one view is that reconciliation and\nretributive justice are in tension with one another. Whereas\nretributive justice focuses on delivering a punishment that fits the\npast crime, reconciliation is concerned with bringing about future\ngood relations. The conflict between justice and reconciliation is\nvisible when individuals or communities choose non-punitive responses\nin hopes of securing peace. According to one view, insofar as\ntransitional societies do not punish wrongdoers, they promote\nreconciliation at a significant moral cost: they sacrifice justice.\nAuthors debate whether this sacrifice may be all-things-considered\nmorally justified, given the exigencies of transitional societies\n(Mendez 1997, Dwyer 1999, Greenawalt 2000).\n\nAnother way of framing the relationship between retributive justice\nand reconciliation is to see doing justice, conceptualized as\npunishment, as contributing to reconciliation (Verdeja 2009, C. Murphy\n2010). From this perspective, retributive justice and reconciliation\nare not fundamentally or necessarily in conflict. Justice may even be\na precondition for reconciliation in cases where allowing impunity for\nserious wrongdoing would fuel resentment and undermine trust in\ninstitutions. Even if individual wrongdoers are further alienated by\npunitive measures, holding them accountable may be productive of a\nbroader reconciliation among victims and other members of the\ncommunity, as well as among future generations.\n\nInstead of conceptualizing the relationship between justice and\nreconciliation through the processes that promote each value, a\ndifferent set of views consider instead the core moral concerns\nconstitutive of each value. According to some scholars, reconciliation\nand justice are compatible, though distinct, moral values, and a\nvariety of processes can respond to the moral concerns each value\ntakes up (Allen 1999, Allais 2012). That is, responses to wrongdoing\ncan be just and conducive to reconciliation in different degrees.\nResponses to wrongdoing may promote some aspects of justice (such as\ndemands for recognition of victims and accountability for\nperpetrators), but not others. For example, this view can accommodate\nthe claim, made during the South African TRC, that wrongdoers are held\naccountable when they are required to undergo the shaming experience\nof testifying publicly to their crimes (Final Report, 1998, vol. 1,\nch. 1, para 35). Similarly, they may foster some dimensions of\nreconciliation (such as epistemic or attitudinal changes), but not\nothers.\n\nA final view is that reconciliation is (part or all of)\njustice (Llewellyn and Howse 1999, Philpott 2012). Theorists who adopt\nthis position regard it as a mistake to equate justice with\nretributive justice. In the view of advocates of restorative justice,\njustice is fundamentally about repairing damaged relationships.\nChairman Rev. Desmond Tutu famously responds to the criticism of the\nTRC\u2019s decision not to pursue retributive justice by saying,\n\u201cWe believe, however, that there is another kind of justice\n\u2013 a restorative justice which is concerned not so much with\npunishment as with correcting imbalances, restoring broken\nrelationships \u2013 with healing, harmony and reconciliation\u201d\n(Final Report, Vol. 1, Ch. 1, para. 36). It is difficult to\nprovide a definitive account of restorative justice. However, the\nemphasis is on achieving a morally appropriate state of relations,\nwhere victims\u2019 needs for recognition, security and reparations\nare given special emphasis (Kiss 2000, Walker 2006). Thus, to promote\nreconciliation is to promote justice. Insofar as holding wrongdoers\naccountable through punishment helps restore morally appropriate\nattitudes, norms and interactions among the victim, the wrongdoer, and\nthe community, punishment is compatible with restorative justice.\nHowever, retribution is not valued for its own sake.\n",
