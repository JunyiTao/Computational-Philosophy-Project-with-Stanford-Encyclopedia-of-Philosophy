    "main_text": "Locke and Newton || Epistemology and methodology\n4.1 Epistemology and methodology\n\nA good deal of resemblance to Locke\u2019s epistemological approach\ncan be seen in Newton, who holds that, revelation apart, we must\ngather what knowledge we can from our perceptions, and anything like a\nreal essence eludes us. In the early manuscript, De\ngravitatione, for instance, Newton denies knowing the\n\u201cessential and metaphysical constitution\u201d of matter\n(Newton, 2004, p. 27). He reiterates this position in later texts,\nincluding the 1713 General Scholium:\n\n\nWe certainly do not know what is the substance of any thing. We see\nonly the shapes and colors of bodies, we hear only their sounds, we\ntouch only their external surfaces\u2026.But there is no direct\nsense and there are no indirect reflected actions by which we know\ninnermost substances (Principia, 942).\n\n\nLocke and Newton also share the problem of an evidentiary deficit,\ninsofar as they subscribe to corpuscularianism. Thinkers who did\nsubscribe tended to rely on transduction (also called\ntransdiction)\u2014an inductive inference that is empirical insofar\nas it relies upon observed cases, but which generalizes not only to\nunobserved cases but to those that are\n unobservable.[26])\n Newton\u2019s Rule 3 licensed such inferences, from the\nPrincipia\u2019s second edition onward, for qualities of\ninvariable intensity, i.e., extension, impenetrability, hardness,\nmobility, and the vis inertiae. The rule explicitly permits\ninferences to the realm of the unobservable: \u201cBecause the\nhardness of the whole arises from the hardness of the parts, we justly\ninfer from this not only the hardness of the undivided particles of\nbodies that are accessible to our senses, but also of all other\nbodies\u201d (Principia, Book 3, p.\n 795[27]).\n As for Locke and the problem of transduction, how serious it is for\nhim depends largely upon the status of the corpuscular hypothesis. If\nhe takes an agnostic or skeptical stance toward it, then he owes no\nsolution to the problem.\n\nAlthough the endeavors of Locke and Newton are often considered\ncomplementary, there are questions about how Locke responded to the\nPrincipia, both in terms of its methodology and its\nepistemological implications. With regard to the former, how far did\nLocke go in absorbing or incorporating the methodology that Newton had\nforged? As a number of commentators have emphasized, the new science\nwas itself in flux at this time, with natural history being gradually\nsidelined by Newton\u2019s approach, an experimentalism that was\ntheoretical and mathematical (see, e.g., Anstey 2011; Roux, 2013).\nGiven that Locke had had Boyle as his mentor but was greatly impressed\nby Newton\u2019s Principia, it is natural to ask whether a\nsimilar shift was occurring in Locke\u2019s own thought. Although\nLocke was influenced by Newton, his allegiances to certain older ideas\nran deep. De Pierris (2006) explains Locke\u2019s failure to adopt\nthe method of inductive proof in terms of his devotion to the ideal of\ndemonstrative knowledge, as combined with a belief in hidden primary\nqualities.\n\nWith regard to its epistemological implications, what precisely did\nLocke take the Principia to have achieved? To pose the\nquestion in the starkest possible terms, might Newton\u2019s\nPrincipia have tempted Locke to retreat from his belief that\nnatural philosophy cannot be made a science (much as it led him to\nretreat from the contact action proviso)? Perhaps Locke categorized\nNewton\u2019s epistemological achievement in natural philosophy as a\ncontribution to sensitive knowledge alone. That is, perhaps he saw\nNewton\u2019s \u201cmighty Designs in advancing the Sciences\u201d\n(Essay, Epistle to the Reader, pp. 9\u201310) as confined to\nproviding a firm basis for natural philosophy through his experimental\nmethod. But did he perhaps instead take Newton\u2019s mathematical\nmethods as offering the demonstrations needed to push natural\nphilosophy into the domain of demonstrative knowledge and hence\nscientia?\n\nCommentators interpreting Locke as seeing Newton\u2019s contribution\nin terms of sensitive knowledge alone include Yolton (1969); Woolhouse\n(1994); and Downing (1997, see especially pp. 292\u201393). Winkler\n(2008), however, reads Locke\u2019s correspondence with Stillingfleet\nand other writings from the 1690s as a defense of Newton\u2019s\nmathematical physics, and one that draws from his mathematical\ndemonstrations a greater optimism about the possibility of certain\nknowledge in natural philosophy. This move has been contested by\nDomski (2012), who argues that Locke advocated Newton\u2019s\nmathematical methods only in connection with astronomy, whose objects\nare unavailable for experimentation; and that Locke maintained his\nemphasis upon natural historical methods for questions about\nterrestrial bodies. The debate over the extent to which Locke\nprioritized natural history over experimentalism directly concerns his\nstance on hypotheses (a controversy mapped by Priselac, 2017), while a\nrelated debate concerns the relationship between medicine and natural\nphilosophy. Opposing Yost (1951) among others, Lu-Adler (2021) has\nrecently argued that Locke did not assume that the scientific\nmethodology most appropriate to medicine could be generalized to\nphysics.\n",
