    "main_text": "Toleration\n7. Toleration\n\nIn Locke\u2019s Letter Concerning Toleration, he develops\nseveral lines of argument that are intended to establish the proper\nspheres for religion and politics. His central claims are that\ngovernment should not use force to try to bring people to the true\nreligion and that religious societies are voluntary organizations that\nhave no right to use coercive power over their own members or those\noutside their group. One recurring line of argument that Locke uses is\nexplicitly religious. Locke argues that neither the example of Jesus\nnor the teaching of the New Testament gives any indication that force\nis a proper way to bring people to salvation. He also frequently\npoints out what he takes to be clear evidence of hypocrisy, namely\nthat those who are so quick to persecute others for small differences\nin worship or doctrine are relatively unconcerned with much more\nobvious moral sins that pose an even greater threat to their eternal\nstate.\n\nIn addition to these and similar religious arguments, Locke gives\nthree reasons that are more philosophical in nature for barring\ngovernments from using force to encourage people to adopt religious\nbeliefs (Works 6:10\u201312). First, he argues that the care\nof men\u2019s souls has not been committed to the magistrate by\neither God or the consent of men. This argument resonates with the\nstructure of argument used so often in the Two Treatises to\nestablish the natural freedom and equality of mankind. There is no\ncommand in the Bible telling magistrates to bring people to the true\nfaith, and people could not consent to such a goal for government\nbecause it is not possible for people, at will, to believe what the\nmagistrate tells them to believe. Their beliefs are a function of what\nthey think is true, not what they will. Locke\u2019s second argument\nis that since the power of the government is only force, while true\nreligion consists of genuine inward persuasion of the mind, force is\nincapable of bringing people to the true religion. Locke\u2019s third\nargument is that even if the magistrate could change people\u2019s\nminds, a situation where everyone accepted the magistrate\u2019s\nreligion would not bring more people to the true religion. Many of the\nmagistrates of the world believe religions that are false.\n\nLocke\u2019s contemporary, Jonas Proast (1999a), responded by saying\nthat Locke\u2019s three arguments really amount to just two, that\ntrue faith cannot be forced and that we have no more reason to think\nthat we are right than anyone else has. Proast argued that force can\nbe helpful in bringing people to the truth \u201cindirectly, and at a\ndistance.\u201d His idea was that although force cannot directly\nbring about a change of mind or heart, it can cause people to consider\narguments that they would otherwise ignore or prevent them from\nhearing or reading things that would lead them astray. If force is\nindirectly useful in bringing people to the true faith, then Locke has\nnot provided a persuasive argument. As for Locke\u2019s argument\nabout the harm of a magistrate whose religion is false using force to\npromote it, Proast claimed that this was irrelevant since there is a\nmorally relevant difference between affirming that the magistrate may\npromote the religion he thinks true and affirming that he may promote\nthe religion that actually is true. Proast thought that unless one was\na complete skeptic, one must believe that the reasons for one\u2019s\nown position are objectively better than those for other\npositions.\n\nJeremy Waldron (1993) restated the substance of Proast\u2019s\nobjection for a contemporary audience. He argued that, leaving aside\nLocke\u2019s Christian arguments, his main position was that it was\ninstrumentally irrational, from the perspective of the persecutor, to\nuse force in matters of religion because force acts only on the will,\nand belief is not something that we change at will. Waldron pointed\nout that this argument blocks only one particular reason for\npersecution, not all reasons. Thus it would not stop someone who used\nreligious persecution for some end other than religious conversion,\nsuch as preserving the peace. Even in cases where persecution does\nhave a religious goal, Waldron agrees with Proast that force may be\nindirectly effective in changing people\u2019s beliefs. Some of the\ncurrent discussion about Locke\u2019s contribution to contemporary\npolitical philosophy in the area of toleration centers on whether\nLocke has a good reply to these objections from Proast and Waldron.\nTuckness (2008b) and Tate (2016) argue that Locke deemphasized the\nrationality argument in his later writings. \n\nSome contemporary commentators try to rescue Locke\u2019s argument by\nredefining the religious goal that the magistrate is presumed to seek.\nSusan Mendus (1989), for example, notes that successful brainwashing\nmight cause a person to sincerely utter a set of beliefs, but that\nthose beliefs might still not count as genuine. Beliefs induced by\ncoercion might be similarly problematic. Paul Bou Habib (2003) argues\nthat what Locke is really after is sincere inquiry and that Locke\nthinks inquiry undertaken only because of duress is necessarily\ninsincere. These approaches thus try to save Locke\u2019s argument by\nshowing that force really is incapable of bringing about the desired\nreligious goal.\n\nOther commentators focus on Locke\u2019s first argument about proper\nauthority, and particularly on the idea that authorization must be by\nconsent. David Wootton (1993) argues that even if force occasionally\nworks at changing a person\u2019s belief, it does not work often\nenough to make it rational for persons to consent to the government\nexercising that power. A person who has good reason to think he will\nnot change his beliefs even when persecuted has good reason to prevent\nthe persecution scenario from ever happening. Richard Vernon (1997)\nargues that we want not only to hold right beliefs, but also to hold\nthem for the right reasons. Since the balance of reasons rather than\nthe balance of force should determine our beliefs, we would not\nconsent to a system in which irrelevant reasons for belief might\ninfluence us. Richard Tate (2016) argues that the strongest argument\nof Locke for toleration is rooted in the fact that we do not consent\nto giving government authority in this area, only the promotion of our\nsecular interests, interests that Locke thought a policy of toleration\nwould further. \n\nStill other commentators focus on the third argument, that the\nmagistrate might be wrong. Here the question is whether Locke\u2019s\nargument is question-begging or not. The two most promising lines of\nargument are the following. Wootton (1993) argues that there are very\ngood reasons, from the standpoint of a given individual, for thinking\nthat governments will be wrong about which religion is true.\nGovernments are motivated by the quest for power, not truth, and are\nunlikely to be good guides in religious matters. Since there are so\nmany different religions held by rulers, if only one is true then\nlikely my own ruler\u2019s views are not true. Wootton thus takes\nLocke to be showing that it is irrational, from the perspective of the\nindividual, to consent to government promotion of religion. A\ndifferent interpretation of the third argument is presented by\nTuckness. He argues that the likelihood that the magistrate may be\nwrong generates a principle of toleration based on what is rational\nfrom the perspective of a legislator, not the perspective of an\nindividual citizen or ruler. Drawing on Locke\u2019s later writings\non toleration, he argues that Locke\u2019s theory of natural law\nassumes that God, as author of natural law, takes into account the\nfallibility of those magistrates who will carry out the commands of\nnatural law. If \u201cuse force to promote the true religion\u201d\nwere a command of natural law addressed to all magistrates, it would\nnot promote the true religion in practice because so many magistrates\nwrongly believe that their religion is the true one. Tuckness claims\nthat in Locke\u2019s later writings on toleration he moved away from\narguments based on what it is instrumentally rational for an\nindividual to consent to. Instead, he emphasized human fallibility and\nthe need for universal principles.\n",
