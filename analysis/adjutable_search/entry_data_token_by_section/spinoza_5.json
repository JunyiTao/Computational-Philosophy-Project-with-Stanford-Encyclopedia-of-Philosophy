    "main_text": "Ethics || Passion and Action\n2.4 Passion and Action\n\nSpinoza engages in such a detailed analysis of the composition of the\nhuman being because it is essential to his goal of showing how the\nhuman being is a part of Nature, existing within the same\ndeterministic causal nexuses as other extended and mental beings. This\nhas serious ethical implications. First, it implies that a human being\nis not endowed with freedom, at least in the ordinary sense of that\nterm. Because our minds and the events in our minds are simply ideas\nthat exist within the causal series of ideas that follows from\nGod\u2019s attribute of thought, our actions and volitions are as\nnecessarily determined as any other natural events. \u201cIn the Mind\nthere is no absolute, or free, will, but the Mind is determined to\nwill this or that by a cause that is also determined by another, and\nthis again by another, and so to infinity\u201d (IIp48).\n\nWhat is true of the will (and, of course, of our bodies) is true of\nall the phenomena of our psychological lives. Spinoza believes that\nthis is something that has not been sufficiently understood by\nprevious thinkers, who seem to have wanted to place the human being on\na pedestal outside of (or above) nature.\n\nMost of those who have written about the Affects, and men\u2019s way\nof living, seem to treat, not of natural things, which follow the\ncommon laws of nature, but of things that are outside nature. Indeed\nthey seem to conceive man in nature as a dominion within a dominion.\nFor they believe that man disturbs, rather than follows, the order of\nnature, that he has absolute power over his actions, and that he is\ndetermined only by himself. (III, Preface)\n\n\nDescartes, for example, believed that if the freedom of the human\nbeing is to be preserved, the soul must be exempt from the kind of\ndeterministic laws that rule over the material universe.\n\nSpinoza\u2019s aim in Parts Three and Four is, as he says in his\nPreface to Part Three, to restore the human being and his volitional\nand emotional life to their proper place in nature. For nothing stands\noutside of nature, not even the human mind.\n\nNature is always the same, and its virtue and power of acting are\neverywhere one and the same, i.e., the laws and rules of nature,\naccording to which all things happen, and change from one form to\nanother, are always and everywhere the same. So the way of\nunderstanding the nature of anything, of whatever kind, must also be\nthe same, viz. through the universal laws and rules of nature.\n\n\nOur affects\u2014our love, anger, hate, envy, pride, jealousy,\netc.\u2014\u201cfollow from the same necessity and force of nature\nas the other singular things\u201d. Spinoza, therefore, explains\nthese emotions\u2014as determined in their occurrence as are a body\nin motion and the properties of a mathematical figure\u2014just as he\nwould explain any other things in nature. \u201cI shall treat the\nnature and power of the Affects, and the power of the Mind over them,\nby the same Method by which, in the preceding parts, I treated God and\nthe Mind, and I shall consider human actions and appetites just as if\nit were a Question of lines, planes, and bodies.\u201d\n\nOur affects are divided into actions and passions. When the cause of\nan event lies wholly in our own nature\u2014more particularly, our\nknowledge or adequate ideas\u2014 and we are the \u201cadequate\ncause\u201d of it, then it is a case of the mind acting. On the other\nhand, when something happens in us the cause of which lies outside of\nour nature, then we are passive and being acted upon. Usually what\ntakes place, both when we are acting and when we are being acted upon,\nis some change in our mental and physical capacities, what Spinoza\ncalls \u201can increase or decrease in our power of acting\u201d or\nin our \u201cpower to persevere in being\u201d. All beings are\nnaturally endowed with such a power or striving. This\nconatus, a kind of existential inertia, constitutes the\n\u201cessence\u201d of any being. \u201cEach thing, as far as it\ncan by its own power, strives to persevere in its being.\u201d An\naffect just is any change in this power, for better or for\nworse. Affects that are actions are changes in this power that have\ntheir source (or adequate cause) in our nature alone; affects that are\npassions are those changes in this power that originate at least\npartly outside of us.\n\nWhat we should strive for is to learn how to moderate and restrain the\npassions and become active, autonomous beings. If we can achieve this,\nthen we will be \u201cfree\u201d to the extent that whatever happens\nto us will result not from our relations with things outside us, but\nfrom our own nature (as that follows from, and is ultimately and\nnecessarily determined by, the attributes of God of which our minds\nand bodies are modes). We will, consequently, be truly liberated from\nthe troublesome emotional ups and downs of this life. The way to bring\nthis about is to increase our knowledge, our store of adequate ideas,\nand reduce as far as possible the power or strength of our inadequate\nideas, which follow not from the nature of the mind alone but from its\nbeing an expression of how our body is affected by other bodies. In\nother words, we need to free ourselves from a reliance on the senses\nand the imagination, since a life guided by the senses and the\nimagination is a life being affected and led by the objects around us,\nand rely as much as we can only on our rational faculties.\n\nBecause of our innate striving to persevere\u2014which, in the human\nbeing, is called \u201cwill\u201d or \u201cappetite\u201d\u2014we\nnaturally pursue those things that we believe will benefit us by\nincreasing our power of acting and shun or flee those things that we\nbelieve will harm us by decreasing our power of acting. This provides\nSpinoza with a foundation for cataloging the human passions. For the\npassions are all functions of the ways in which external things affect\nour powers or capacities. Joy (Laetitiae, sometimes\ntranslated as \u201cpleasure\u201d), for example, is simply the\nmovement or passage to a greater capacity for action. \u201cBy Joy\n\u2026 I shall understand that passion by which the Mind passes to a\ngreater perfection\u201d (IIIp11s). When joy is a passion, it is\nalways brought about by some external object. Sadness\n(Tristitiae, or \u201cpain\u201d), on the other hand, is\nthe passage to a lesser state of perfection, also occasioned by a\nthing outside us. Love is simply Joy accompanied by an awareness of\nthe external cause that brings about the passage to a greater\nperfection. We love that object that benefits us and causes us joy.\nHate is nothing but \u201csadness with the accompanying idea of an\nexternal cause\u201d. Hope is simply \u201can inconstant joy which\nhas arisen from the image of a future or past thing whose outcome we\ndoubt\u201d. We hope for a thing whose presence, as yet uncertain,\nwill bring about joy. We fear, however, a thing whose presence,\nequally uncertain, will bring about sadness. When that whose outcome\nwas doubtful becomes certain, hope is changed into confidence, while\nfear is changed into despair.\n\nAll of the human emotions, in so far as they are passions, are\nconstantly directed outward, towards things and their capacities to\naffect us one way or another. Aroused by our passions and desires, we\nseek or flee those things that we believe cause joy or sadness.\n\u201cWe strive to further the occurrence of whatever we imagine will\nlead to Joy, and to avert or destroy what we imagine is contrary to\nit, or will lead to Sadness.\u201d Our hopes and fears fluctuate\ndepending on whether we regard the objects of our desires or aversions\nas remote, near, necessary, possible or unlikely. But the objects of\nour passions, being external to us, are completely beyond our control.\nThus, the more we allow ourselves to be controlled by them,\nthe more we are subject to passions and the less active and free we\nare. The upshot is a fairly pathetic picture of a life mired in the\npassions and pursuing and fleeing the changeable and fleeting objects\nthat occasion them: \u201cWe are driven about in many ways by\nexternal causes, and \u2026 like waves on the sea, driven by\ncontrary winds, we toss about, not knowing our outcome and fate\u201d\n(IIIp59s). The title for Part Four of the Ethics reveals with\nperfect clarity Spinoza\u2019s evaluation of such a life for a human\nbeing: \u201cOn Human Bondage, or the Powers of the Affects\u201d.\nHe explains that the human being\u2019s \u201clack of power to\nmoderate and restrain the affects I call Bondage. For the man who is\nsubject to affects is under the control, not of himself, but of\nfortune, in whose power he so greatly is that often, though he sees\nthe better for himself, he is still forced to follow the worse\u201d.\nIt is, he says, a kind of \u201csickness of the mind\u201d to suffer\ntoo much love for a thing \u201cthat is liable to many variations and\nthat we can never fully possess.\u201d\n",
