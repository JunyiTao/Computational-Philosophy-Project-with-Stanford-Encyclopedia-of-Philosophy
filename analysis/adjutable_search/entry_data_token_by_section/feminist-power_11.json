    "main_text": "Power as Empowerment\n5. Concluding thoughts\n\nThe concept of power is central to a wide variety of debates in\nfeminist philosophy. Indeed, the very centrality of this concept to\nfeminist theorizing creates difficulties in writing an entry such as\nthis one: since the concept of power is operative on one way or\nanother in almost all work in feminist theory, it is extremely\ndifficult to place limits on the relevant sources. Throughout, I have\nemphasized those texts and debates in which the concept of power is a\ncentral theme, even if sometimes an implicit one. I have also\nprioritized those authors and texts that have been most influential\nwithin feminist philosophy, as opposed to the wider terrain of\nfeminist theory or gender studies, though I acknowledge that this\ndistinction is difficult to maintain and perhaps not always terribly\nuseful. Debatable as such framing choices may be, they do offer some\nmuch needed help in delimiting the range of relevant sources and\nproviding focus and structure to the discussion.\n",
