    "main_text": "Claims and Projects within Economic Analysis of Law || Rationality in Economic Analysis of Law\n1.1 Rationality in Economic Analysis of Law\n\nEconomic analysis of law deploys the tools of micro-economic theory to\nstudy legal rules and institutions. The various approaches and\nprojects within economic analysis of law thus share a common core.\nThat core consists of the conception of action at the center of\nmicro-economic\n theory.[1]\n When economic analysis of law first emerged in the 1960s, scholars\nadopted the standard rationality assumptions that dominated\nmicroeconomic theory at the time. This practice still dominates the\nliterature; we shall call it the standard or classical model. In the\n1990s, some scholars (see e.g. Jolls, Sunstein, and Thaler [1998])\nbegan to apply the methods of behavioral economics to economic\nanalysis of law. Behavioral economics rests on a different\nunderstanding of the underpinnings of choice and decision than the\nclassical model. \n1.1.1 Rationality in the Classical Model\n\nRational action in economics means that each agent acts to maximize\nher \u201cpreferences\u201d in whatever environment she finds\nherself. A preference is a ranking of the elements in her\ndomain of preference. The agent\u2019s domain of preference consists\nof the things that fundamentally matter to her. In standard models of\nconsumer behavior, for example, the agent has fundamental preferences\nover consumption bundles. Her decision problem consists of choosing a\nconsumption bundle from the set of feasible consumption bundles, where\nfeasibility is defined by the prices of goods and the agent\u2019s\nincome. Arlen and Kornhauser [2021] elaborate on the structure of\npreferences in economic analysis of law. \n\nIn most economic analyses of law, the situation is more complex. The\nagent has preferences over some set of consequences\u2014her income\nor wealth, her state of health, etc.\u2014and she chooses some action\nthat in part determines which consequence is realized. Typically, her\ndomain of preference differs from her domain of choice, often because\nshe chooses a strategy that, in conjunction with the strategy\nchoices of other agents, jointly determines the consequence. \n\nAt its most abstract level, this conception of rationality is very\nflexible as the constraints on preferences are almost purely formal.\n(The discussion in section 4 essentially investigates the extent of\nthis flexibility.) \n\nBasically, the agent\u2019s ranking of elements of her domain of\npreference must be complete and transitive. Completeness means only\nthat the agent, when presented with any pair A and B of elements in\nher domain of preference can rank A and B. That is, the agent either\nprefers A to B, prefers B to A, or is indifferent between A and B.\nSome, but not all, relations are complete. The relation \u201cPareto\nsuperior to,\u201d discussed at length in section 6.2, for example,\nis not complete.\n\nTransitivity means that if the agent prefers an element A to an\nelement B and she prefers the element B to a third element C, then she\nprefers element A to element C. Many, but not all, relations are\ntransitive. The relation \u201cfriends with,\u201d for example, is\nnot transitive as A may be friends with B and B may be friends with C\nwhile A and C mutually detest each other. The two conditions are thus\nminimal though not empty. \n\nEvery economic analysis of law provides some substantive content to\neach agent\u2019s preference ranking. Typically, the analyst\nattributes self-interested preferences to each agent. The\nagent ranks consequences solely on the basis of their effect on her.\nIn the standard market model, for example, the agent cares only about\nher own consumption not the consumption of others. In the standard\neconomic model of accident law, she cares only about injuries to\nherself and costs that she may incur; she pays no attention to\ninjuries to others or costs that others incur. \n\nOf course, one might define \u201cself-interested\u201d in a broad\nway to include anything that motivates the agent. Typically, however,\nthe analyst assumes that the agent\u2019s preferences are\nnarrowly self-interested; she cares only about her own\neconomic advantage or her own health and safety. The assumption of\nnarrowly self-interested preferences is very restrictive. An agent\nwith narrowly self-interested preferences seems to be incapable of\nfollowing a rule or having anything other than a prudential reason for\naction. The assumption of narrow self-interest thus seems to limit the\nconception of the normativity of law to a bare sanction theory of\nduty. We discuss this issue in section 4 below.\n1.1.2 Behavioral Economic Analysis of Law\n\nBehavioral economic analysis of law takes three forms. The first\naccepts the formal framework of rational choice but rejects the\ninterpretation of preferences in this framework as self-interested.\nCall this the \u201cbroad RCT\u201d branch of behavioral economics.\nThe other two forms of behavioral economics derive from psychology\nwhich seeks to understand the mental processes that agents actually\ndeploy in their decision making. Both of these forms of behavioral\neconomics reject the apparent assumption of the classical model that\nagents consciously and directly maximize their preferences. But each\nform adopts a different stance towards human rationality. The\n\u201cfast and frugal heuristics\u201d branch claims that agents are\necologically rational. The heuristics and biases form of behavioral\neconomics contends that agents are not rational. We discuss these in\nturn. \n\nThe broad RCT approach endorses the formal preference model of the\nclassical model; it only rejects the narrow interpretation of\npreferences as self-interested. Individuals may have\nnon-self-interested preferences. They may have\n\u201cpro-social\u201d preferences that reflect a concern for\nothers. They may have preferences for \u201cfairness\u201d which\nreflect a \u201cpreference\u201d for more equal distributions of\nbenefits and burdens. Indeed, one might posit preferences that reflect\nconcerns for almost anything. The approach thus risks the ad\nhoc ascription of preferences, an issue discussed further in\nsection 4. \n\nThe ecological rationality school accepts the classical model as a\nnormative standard against which individual behavior should be\nassessed. It rejects the classical model as descriptive of individual\ndecision procedures. An agent does not solve the optimization problem\nthat the classical and broad RCT models posit. This school recognizes\nthat computation is costly and that often the agent lacks adequate\ninformation to complete the calculation. Consequently, individuals\ndeploy heuristic decision procedures that, under these constraints,\nperform well as measured by the RCT model of rationality. \n\nThe heuristics and biases school, by contrast, understands the\nexistence of heuristics and biases as evidence that individuals behave\nirrationally. Any decision process that deviates from classical logic,\nBayesian updating, or strict preference maximization constitutes\nirrational behavior. \n\nBehavioral economic analysis of law typically adapts the classical\nmodel to include a heuristic or bias. The model, that is, specifies a\ndecision process that, except on the dimension along which the\nheuristic or bias works, conforms to the classical model. The analysis\nthen identifies equilibrium behavior in this model. The structure of\nanalysis thus parallels the structure of a classical analysis. \n",
