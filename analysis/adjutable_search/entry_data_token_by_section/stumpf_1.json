    "main_text": "Historical Background\n2. Historical Background\n\nThe two most important names associated with the young Stumpf\u2019s\nphilosophical formation are those of Franz Brentano and Hermann Lotze.\nHis debt to Brentano is well documented in his autobiography and in\nthe three biographies, which Stumpf (1918, 1919, 1922) devoted to him\nafter his death in 1917. But opinions diverged regarding\nStumpf\u2019s later position to Brentano\u2019s philosophical\nprogram. Some claim that Stumpf is a truly orthodox Brentanian (K.\nSchuhmann, 1996) while others argue that Stumpf gradually distanced\nhimself from Brentano\u2019s thinking and moved closer to that of\nLotze (Ewen, 2008 Milkov 2015). The truth must lie somewhere in the\nmiddle if we are to judge the matter in light of Stumpf\u2019s many\ntestimonies in his biographical articles and in his substantial\ncorrespondence with Brentano where he unequivocally acknowledges his\ndebt to Brentano.\n\nStumpf\u2019s debt to Lotze\u2019s philosophy is certainly\nsignificant but it is not very well documented. Most studies on the\nrelationship between Stumpf and Lotze emphasize Lotze\u2019s theory\nof local signs (see W. R. Woodward, 1978; Fisette, 2006, 2012; B.\nCenti, 2011) and the problem of the origins of space perception, which\nis in fact the central theme of Stumpf\u2019s Raumbuch\n(Stumpf, 1873; M. Kaiser-El-Safti, 1994; D. Pradelle, 2015). In this\nbook, dedicated to Lotze, Stumpf offers a summary of the debates\nbetween philosophers, scientists, and psychologists on the origins of\nspace perception since Fechner. In the preface to this book, Stumpf\nexplains that his starting point is the controversy between nativism\nand empiricism triggered by Helmholtz in his Handbuch (H. von\nHelmholtz, 1910, vol. 3, \u00a7 25) while his inspiration lies in\nLotze (1852) Medizinischer Psychologie.\nLotze\u2019s influence on the young Stumpf\u2019s thought is not\nlimited to his doctrine of local signs as Stumpf repeatedly emphasized\n(R. Rollinger, 2008; N. Milkov, 2015; D. Fisette, 2009b). Beyond the\nquestion of influence, Stumpf assigns a central role to Lotze\u2019s\nthought in the history of philosophy and associates him with a\nrenaissance of philosophy in the mid-nineteenth century (Stumpf,\n1907).\n\nFrom his two mentors Brentano and Lotze, Stumpf inherited a marked\ninterest in the history of philosophy. This interest was not strictly\nhistoriographical: his point of departure was\nBrentano\u2019s theory of the four phases in the history of\nphilosophy, and he worked out his own philosophy of history, which\nconstitutes the basis of his diagnosis on the state of philosophy in\nthe nineteenth century, which is inseparable from the way he conceived\nof philosophy. In his first address as the rector of the university of\nBerlin delivered in 1907 under the title \u201cRenaissance of\nPhilosophy,\u201d exactly a hundred years after Fichte\u2019s\n\u201cAddress to the German Nation\u201d at the same university,\nStumpf applied this philosophy of history to the nineteenth century\nand asked whether philosophy at this time belonged to an ascending\nstage of history and whether it tended towards a renaissance of\nphilosophy. He identified two factors which marked the development of\nphilosophy during this period: the empty space left by the decline of\nspeculative philosophy of German idealism during the first half of the\nnineteenth century, and the remarkable development of psychology and\nof the physiology of senses during the second half of this century,\ndue to the works of physiologists and physicists such as Fechner,\nWeber, Hering, and Helmholtz. These two factors corresponded to two\ndivergent philosophical orientations at the time when Stumpf was\nundertaking his studies in philosophy. The first was the Kantian\ntradition in its different ramifications, including Neo-Kantianism;\nthe second corresponds to what he called\nErfahrungsphilosophie or philosophy of experience, which\nbegan with Fechner and above all with Lotze\u2019s works on\npsychology and more particularly on the problem of space perception.\nAlthough it does not represent a homogeneous tradition, the philosophy\nof experience refers to common features of several schools and\ncurrents of thought which attempted to bring philosophy closer to\nnatural sciences, and more particularly to the \u201cnew\npsychology\u201d, which was neglected and relegated to the background\nby the other tradition. Corresponding to these two orientations are\ntwo different ways of doing philosophy: the philosophy of experience\nstarts from below, and like any empirical science, uses the inductive\nmethod. They differ from an a priori and speculative approach\nto philosophy which favors an autocratic regime entirely disconnected\nfrom the empirical.\n\nAs B. Russell pointed out in his Essay on the Foundations of\nGeometry, Stumpf\u2019s main criticism against Kant and a\npriori philosophy concerns the dichotomy between form and matter,\nmore precisely the postulate of a priori forms of thought and\nsensibility. This criticism was already clearly formulated in his\nRaumbuch, where he examined the nativism-empiricism\ncontroversy on space perception, prepared some years earlier by\nHelmholtz in the third book of his Handbuch. This controversy\nis at the origin of an important division in the middle of the\nnineteenth century within the new psychology proponents, between\nempiricism advocated mainly by Helmholtz and Wundt; and nativism\nwhich, according to Helmholtz, characterizes the works of Ewald Hering\nin physiology, the latter of which in fact exercised an influence on\nthe Brentano school and to a certain extent on Gestalt psychology.\nInstead of using Helmholtz\u2019s terminology, as did most\nhistorians, Stumpf preferred the term phenomenology to designate the\nstudy of phenomenal experience, which occupied center stage in the\nfield of physiology and psychology. In his Raumbuch Stumpf\ntakes a stand in favor of a moderate form of nativism, according to\nwhich space is a unitary sense, its content is perceptible in an\nimmediate and direct way, and it is inseparable from sensory qualities\nsuch as color and sound. Consequently, space and color constitute one\nand the same content, of which they are partial contents or\nattributes. They are in a relation of logical dependence with the\nphenomena of which they form a part. Hence, extension and color form a\nconcrete whole which can only be separated through abstraction. From\nthis point of view, the concept of space, as any concept, draws upon\nits origin in sense perception and is, to use the Scholastic\nexpression, an abstracta cum fundamento in re.\n",
