His criticism of\nBuddhap\u0101lita was focused primarily on that very point;\nBuddhap\u0101lita offered no statement of what the M\u0101dhyamikas\nbelieve but confined himself to pointing out that what other people\nbelieve is untenable in one way or another. To criticize the positions\nof others but not to venture to state a position of one\u2019s own\nwas regarded by the Indian debate tradition as a substandard use of\nargumentation called vita\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101, which\nliterally means making an attack. Bh\u0101vaviveka was at pains to\nshow that M\u0101dhyamikas could not legitimately be accused of this\nsort of philosophical sniping. He affirmed that M\u0101dhyamikas do\nhave a conviction that they are prepared to state and defend, namely,\nthat all phenomena are devoid of an inherent nature, that is, a nature\nthat they have independently. All phenomena are conditioned, and such\nnatures as they have are natures that they acquire through their\nconditions rather than on their own. The concise Madhyamaka way of\nsaying all this is to say that all phenomena (dharmas) are\nempty (\u015b\u016bnya). Since the M\u0101dhyamikas believe\nthat all phenomena are empty, they owe it to their readers to provide\nreasons for thinking that that is a reasonable thing to believe.\n\nIn providing arguments in favor of the conclusions accepted by\nM\u0101dhyamikas, Bh\u0101vaviveka followed the example set by\nDign\u0101ga (fl. ca. 510), a Buddhist whose principal contributions\nwere in the area of epistemology and logic. Dign\u0101ga, following\nwith some modifications philosophers of the Brahmanical Ny\u0101ya\nschool, had devised a canonical form of presenting arguments, which\nconsisted in identifying a topic (pak\u1e63a) and reasoning\non the basis of an observed feature of the topic that it also had\nanother feature not currently available for direct observation. The\nstock example given in Indian logic is that if a particular mountain\nis the topic, one can reason on the basis of observing smoke\nassociated with that mountain that there is also a fire associated\nwith that mountain. Attributing an unobserved feature to a topic on\nthe basis of an observed feature is legitimate only if one has\npreviously observed the feature used as evidence together with the\nfeature being inferred, and if one has never seen the feature used as\nevidence in the absence of the feature being inferred.\nDign\u0101ga\u2019s method of presenting an argument consists, then,\nin stating a topic (pak\u1e63a) and a property used as\nevidence (s\u0101dhaka-dharma) for a property to be\nestablished (s\u0101dhya-dharma). Bh\u0101vaviveka followed\nthis method in arguing for the conclusions of which he claimed\nM\u0101dhyamikas are convinced; he also criticized Buddhap\u0101lita\nfor failing to follow Dign\u0101ga\u2019s method.\n\nIn his discussion of MMK 1.1, Bh\u0101vaviveka makes the general\nobservation that when N\u0101g\u0101rjuna negates a proposition, he is\nnegating the entire proposition rather than negating just the\npredicate. If one negates just a predicate, that leaves open the\npossibility that some other predicate can suitably be applied to the\nsubject in question. Negation of a predicate in a proposition\npresupposes the existence of the subject of the proposition, whereas\nnegation of the entire proposition need not rest on such a\npresupposition. So when N\u0101g\u0101rjuna says that a phenomenon\ndoes not arise from itself, one should understand that to be a way of\nsaying \u201cIt is not the case that a phenomenon arises from\nitself.\u201d If one were to construe N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s\nstatement as equivalent to something like \u201cThe arising of a\nphenomenon is not from the phenomenon itself,\u201d then one would\nnaturally take that to be saying that the arising of a phenomenon is\nfrom something other than itself. Alternatively, one might take it to\nbe saying that the arising of a phenomenon is not only from\nitself but rather from something that is partly itself and partly\nsomething other than itself. If one takes N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s\nproposition to be a series of conjoined propositions of the form\n\u201cIt is not the case that a phenomenon arises from itself\nand it is not the case that a phenomenon arises from\nsomething other than itself, and it is not the case that a\nphenomenon arises from itself in cooperation with something other than\nitself, and it is not the case that a phenomenon arises from\nnothing at all,\u201d then there is no paradox involved in negating\nboth a simple proposition and its contradiction. It is therefore\nimportant to make it clear when N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s negations\nare sentential negations and when they are term-negations, and this\nBuddhap\u0101lita failed to do.\n\nBh\u0101vaviveka goes on to explain that N\u0101g\u0101rjuna employed\nsentential negations in MMK 1.1, because he was trying to establish a\nkind of \u201cnon-conceptual cognition,\u201d that is, an insight\nthat cannot be expressed in words. The scope of this non-conceptual\ninsight is everything that is capable of being cognized. In other\nwords, N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s insight was that everything that\none thinks one knows, every explanation one thinks one has to account\nfor one\u2019s experiences, is flawed and must ultimately be\nabandoned. In saying this, Bh\u0101vaviveka is consistent with a\nnumber of important statements in MMK and VV. N\u0101g\u0101rjuna had\nlaid emphasis on the claim that the Buddha had dealt out two kinds of\ntruth, a quotidian transactional or conventional truth\n(vyavah\u0101ra-satya, sa\u1e43v\u1e5bti-satya) and a truth\nconcerning the highest goal (param\u0101rtha-satya), namely,\nnirvana. Of these, only the transactional truth is capable of being\narticulated in language. The highest goal, consisting of a silence of\nthe mind in which there is no conceptual thinking, is naturally\ninexpressible in language, since language is necessarily bound up with\nconcepts. Some form of this view was shared by all M\u0101dhyamikas.\nWhere they differed with one another was on the issue of how the\nteachings of Buddhism, which are communicated in language, relate to\nthe highest goal of Buddhism, which lies outside the scope of\nlanguage.\n\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna wrote in MMK 18.9 that the defining\ncharacteristics of reality (tattva, literally,\n\u201cthatness\u201d or quiddity) are that it is not conditioned by\nsomething other than itself, it is peaceful, it cannot be elaborated\nthrough verbal elaborations, it is non-conceptual, and it is uniform.\nIn his commentary to that verse, Bh\u0101vaviveka expands the meaning\nof the verse by saying that anything that is not conceptual in nature\ncannot be expressed through verbal elaborations or through any other\nkind of sign. In other words, what is non-conceptual in nature cannot\nbe known indirectly, and knowledge gained through language is always\nmediated and indirect. For this reason, reality is entirely outside\nthe range of language. That notwithstanding, says Bh\u0101vaviveka,\nwhat language can do is convey something about the general\nnature of what is talked about. The statement that phenomena are\nlacking in inherent natures, for example, does convey useful general\ninformation about reality. Even though reality itself can be known\nonly directly through a non-conceptual awareness, language can be\nhelpful in conveying that very information, namely, that reality can\nbe apprehended only directly and not through language. That the\nM\u0101dhyamika has, and defends, the view that reality lacks inherent\nnature means that the M\u0101dhyamika is not merely engaging in\nphilosophical sniping of the vita\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101\nvariety.\n\nIn his Tarkajv\u0101l\u0101, in which Bh\u0101vaviveka is\nfreed from the constraints of following N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s\ntexts and puts forward his own approach to Madhyamaka, he states that\nthe term \u201chighest goal\u201d (param\u0101rtha-satya)\nhas two aspects. One aspect is that it is free from volitional\nthought, pure and beyond the reach of verbal elaborations. Another\naspect is that it is volitional in nature, connected with the\naccumulation of knowledge and meritorious karma, and connected with\nverbal elaborations and with the transactional knowledge of everyday\nlife. By seeing the ultimate goal in this way, Bh\u0101vaviveka claims\nto give an account that leaves reality intact as a uniform whole about\nwhich knowledge can be diverse and incremental. This incremental\nnature of knowledge makes ample room for the traditional\nMah\u0101y\u0101na teachings of the gradated bodhisattva path whereby\none moves from the aspiration for enlightenment to the gradual\nrealization of enlightenment. A metaphor that Bh\u0101vaviveka uses\nfor the Buddhist path is that it follows verbal teachings which are\nlike a ladder that one slowly ascends until one can climb over the\nwall into non-conceptual direct awareness of the peaceful reality of\nnirvana in which there is nothing to be wished for, nothing to be\nunderstood and no hypothesis to be defended.\n",
