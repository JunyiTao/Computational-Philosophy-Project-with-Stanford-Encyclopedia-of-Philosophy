    "main_text": "Contemporary Hermeneutics || Tradition and Prejudice\n4.2 Tradition and Prejudice\n\nGadamer\u2019s philosophical hermeneutics proceeds on the basis of\nthese considerations of humanism and art as an attempt to establish\nthe essential elements of the hermeneutical experience of\n truth.[5]\n In this, the hermeneutical experience of truth is conditioned by\ntradition and language.\n\nThe claim that the hermeneutical experience of truth is conditioned by\ntradition is not reducible to historicism or the historicist project\nof determining, say, what an artist or an author took to be\ntrue through a reconstruction of the historical context of the\nartwork or text under consideration. Quite to the contrary, the\nhermeneutical experience of truth concerns something that holds true\nfor our own existence. Rather, then, the hermeneutical experience of\ntruth is conditioned by tradition in the sense that it is limited and\nmade possible by the historical transmission of meaning. The claim\nthat the hermeneutical experience of truth is conditioned by tradition\nstresses the sense of the etymological origins of the word\n\u2018tradition\u2019 in the Latin tr\u0101diti\u014dn-\n(stem of tr\u0101diti\u014d), a handing over, delivery or\nhanding down of knowledge (OED 2020, \u201ctradition,\nn.\u201d). This claim also stresses the sense of Gadamer\u2019s\nGerman term for tradition, \u00dcberlieferung, which,\ntranslated literally, means a \u2018delivering over.\u2019 In this,\nthe hermeneutical experience of truth involves belonging to a\nhistorical tradition. Contrary to a common misconception of Gadamerian\nphilosophical hermeneutics, traditions are not monoliths. Traditions\nare more like processes\u2014idiomatic, dynamic, and\nevolving\u2014that, to borrow from Whitman, \u201ccontain\nmultitudes\u201d (Whitman, Song of Myself, Sec. 51).\nAccordingly, to belong to a tradition is not first to possess an\nidentity derived from a cultural or ethnic heritage; it is, rather, to\nbe a participant in a movement of handing down, delivering over.\n\nIn Gadamer\u2019s philosophical hermeneutics, the\nhermeneutical experience of truth, as conditioned by tradition, is\nthus a matter of prejudice. Gadamer clarifies the meaning of\n\u2018prejudice\u2019 in reference to the early Heidegger. Gadamer\nagrees with Heidegger that human existence is characterized by\nfacticity, so that understanding, or, our projection of possibilities,\nis oriented by \u2018pre-structures\u2019 that are a matter of thrownness. Yet, such \u2018pre-structures\u2019 are best described\nas \u2018prejudices\u2019 because they concern more than the\nindividual situations that comprise our existence. These\n\u2018pre-structures\u2019 are shaped by the larger context of\nhistorically inherited meanings that remain operative, or, in effect,\nin such situations of our individual existence in the first place\n(Gadamer, Truth and Method, Part II.II.1.A).\n\nTradition, so conceived, proves to be a legitimate source of authority\nfor the hermeneutical experience of truth. Gadamer\u2019s\nphilosophical hermeneutics thus comprises a counterpoint to the\nrejection of the authority of tradition in modern science. Gadamer\nassociates this rejection above all with the \u201cprejudice against\nprejudice\u201d developed in the European Enlightenment (Gadamer,\nTruth and Method, 270). In this, the motto of the\nEnlightenment is that we should think for ourselves, basing our\nbeliefs in our own use of reason and not the authority of tradition,\nwhether this authority is conceived in terms of superstition,\nreligious or aristocratic rule, or custom. Gadamer recognizes that the\nEnlightenment charge to think for ourselves is legitimate, but he does\nnot believe it follows from this that tradition cannot be a source of\ntruth. He writes,\n\nThe Enlightenment\u2019s distinction between faith in authority and\nusing one\u2019s own reason is, in itself, legitimate. If the\nprestige of authority displaces one\u2019s own judgment, then\nauthority is in fact a source of prejudices. But this does not\npreclude its being a source of truth, and that is what the\nEnlightenment failed to see when it denigrated all authority\n(Gadamer, Truth and Method, 279).\n\nIn Gadamer\u2019s philosophical hermeneutics, the experience of truth\ndoes not demand that we liberate ourselves from the authority of\ntradition, but, on the contrary, recognizes tradition as a possible\nsource of our claims of truth. To be sure, tradition is not therefore\na foundation of claims to truth. Tradition is, after all, a process of\ntransmission, which is ultimately \u201cungroundable\u201d and\n\u201cunderivable\u201d (Gadamer, Truth and Method, 254,\ntranslation\n modified).[6]\n Yet, even if it is not a foundation, tradition is a legitimate\ninterpretive wellspring, in the sense that it makes possible and\nshapes all understanding.\n",
