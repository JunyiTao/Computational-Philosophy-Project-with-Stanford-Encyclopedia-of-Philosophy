    "main_text": "Five Philosophical Themes || The Cognitive Value of Art\n4. Further Questions\n\nMany more questions centred around these five philosophical themes\nremain to be examined in relation to conceptual art. With regards to\nconcerns about defining art, we need to address the increasing number\nof worries to do with exactly how we are to distinguish art from\nnon-art, and indeed whether there really is a distinction (if only\ntheoretical) to be drawn here. That is to say, if conceptual art is at\ntimes not only perceptually indistinguishable from non-art but it is\nalso the case that everything is alleged to be (part of) a potential\nartwork, perhaps the inevitable outcome is that there simply cannot be\na principled distinction between art and non-art. So, does the\nconceptual project lead to the end of the category of art as such?\n\nFrom the ontological perspective, this set of concerns acquires an\neven more aggressive flavour: if art should be all about putting\nforward ideas and making statements, why, one might wonder, do we need\nthe conceptual artwork at all? Can we not merely ask the same\nquestions and make the same statements directly?\n\nIn addition to these questions, the host of issues that have been\nraised about interpretation, intention, appreciation and the way they\nare (or should be) related have not yet been silenced. For art that is\nas discourse-dependent as most conceptual art is, it is not always\nclear whether there is anything more to interpreting conceptual art\nthan just being told what the idea in question is. And if so, can we\nstill call this interpretation?\n\nFinally, what are we to make of the relation between aesthetic and\ncognitive value in conceptual art \u2013 should they be considered as\nin opposition or even as mutually exclusive? If the only kind of value\nthat is of genuine artistic importance is cognitive value, it will be\ndifficult to avoid the definitional and ontological concerns mentioned\nabove. Also, it will call for a deeply revisionary conception of art,\none fundamentally hostile to the very notions we are probably most\nused to associating with art, namely beauty and aesthetic\npleasure.\n\nCentral to the philosophy of conceptual art is thus the provocative\nspirit of the project under investigation \u2013 conceptual art\nthrows down the gauntlet by challenging us to reconsider every aspect\nof artistic experience, and it may well be up to philosophy to pick it\nup and address some of the questions conceptual art makes its business\nto raise. Conceptual art actively aims to be thought-provoking,\nstimulating and inspiring, and if only for that reason, philosophers\ninterested in art should not pass it by unaffected.\n",
