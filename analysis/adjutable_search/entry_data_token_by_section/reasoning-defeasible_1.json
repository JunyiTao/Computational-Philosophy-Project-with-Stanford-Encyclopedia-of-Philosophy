    "main_text": "History || Philosophy\n1.1 Philosophy\n\nAccording to Aristotle, deductive logic (especially in the form of the\nsyllogism) plays a central role in the articulation of scientific\nunderstanding, deducing observable phenomena from definitions of\nnatures that hold universally and without exception. However, in the\npractical matters of everyday life, we rely upon generalizations that\nhold only \u201cfor the most part\u201d, under normal circumstances,\nand the application of such common sense generalizations involves\nmerely dialectical reasoning, reasoning that is defeasible\nand falls short of deductive validity. Aristotle lays out a large\nnumber and great variety of examples of such reasoning in his work\nentitled the Topics.\n\nInvestigations in logic after Aristotle (from later antiquity through\nthe twentieth century) seem to have focused exclusively on deductive\nlogic. This continued to be true as the predicate logic was developed\nby Peirce, Frege, Russell, Whitehead, and others in the late\nnineteenth and early twentieth centuries. With the collapse of logical\npositivism in the mid-twentieth century (and the abandonment of\nattempts to treat the physical world as a logical construction from\nfacts about sense data), new attention was given to the relationship\nbetween sense perception and the external world. Roderick Chisholm\n(Chisholm 1957; Chisholm 1966) argued that sensory appearances give\ngood, but defeasible, reasons for believing in corresponding facts\nabout the physical world. If I am \u201cappeared to redly\u201d\n(have the sensory experience as of being in the presence of something\nred), then, Chisholm argued, I may presume that I really am in the\npresence of something red. This presumption can, of course, be\ndefeated, if, for example, I learn that my environment is relevantly\nabnormal (for instance, all the ambient light is red).\n\nH. L. A. Hart (Hart 1951), at a 1949 meeting of the Aristotelian\nSociety, noted the centrality of defeasible reasoning in the law,\nespecially within the Anglo-American common law tradition. Hart\npointed out that judges must take into account exceptional\ncircumstances in which a legal principle cannot be applied at all or\nmust be applied in a weakened form. Hart refers explicitly to\nconditions that can  defeat (Hart 1951, p. 175) the claim\nthat a contract exists, even when the standard definition of\n\u2018contract\u2019 is satisfied. A defeasible logic is needed\nbecause a judge is required to make a judgment on the basis of an\nincomplete set of facts: those facts that are presented to the judge\nby the two parties as germane to the claim.\n\nThe idea of defeasibility also showed up in work on the formal theory\nof argumentation, including Stephen Toulmin\u2019s  The Uses of\nArgument (Toulmin 1964). Toulmin, building on Hart\u2019s\nobservations, argues for the importance of distinguishing between\nwarrants and rebuttals (Toulmin 1964, 101ff, 143ff). The formal theory\nof argumentation (van Eemeren et al. 2020; Prakken and Vreeswijk 2002)\nhas proved a fruitful ground for the development of models of\ndefeasible reasoning.\n\nJohn L. Pollock developed Chisholm\u2019s idea into a theory of\nprima facie reasons and defeaters of those reasons\n(Pollock 1967, 1970, 1974, 1987, 1995, 2010). Pollock distinguished\nbetween two kinds of defeaters of a defeasible inference:\nrebutting defeaters (which give one a prima facie reason for\nbelieving the denial of the original conclusion) and\n undercutting defeaters\n (which give one a reason for doubting that the usual relationship\nbetween the premises and the conclusion hold in the given case).\nAccording to Pollock, a conclusion is warranted, given all of\none\u2019s evidence, if it is supported by an ultimately undefeated\nargument whose premises are drawn from that evidence.\n",
