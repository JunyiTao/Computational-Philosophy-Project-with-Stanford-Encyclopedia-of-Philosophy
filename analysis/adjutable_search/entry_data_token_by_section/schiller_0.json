    "main_text": "Early Life and Literary Beginnings\n1. Early Life and Literary Beginnings\n\nBorn in 1759 in Marbach am Neckar, Schiller showed such early\nintellectual promise that he was recruited by Karl Eugen, Duke of\nW\u00fcrttemberg, to attend his military academy. There Schiller was\nbroadly educated, including in medicine, and became an army doctor in\n1780. But his interests always lay in more humanistic subjects.\nAlready in 1777, he had published his first poem; soon thereafter, he\nbegan composing dramas. The revolutionary mood of the age, combined\nwith his deep objections to the Duke\u2019s tyrannical rule, prompted\na passion for freedom already evident in his first play, The\nRobbers [Die R\u00e4uber], whose protagonists defy\nsocial norms at the expense of their own lives. The play premiered in\nMannheim in 1782, achieved instant success, and quickly earned\nSchiller international fame. The Duke, alarmed at Schiller\u2019s\nrevolutionary tendencies, had him arrested and forbade further\nplaywriting. Schiller responded by fleeing to Mannheim to begin his\nliterary career in earnest (Martinson 2005a: 2; Sharpe 1991:\nviii).\n\nIn the succeeding decade, Schiller authored plays and other literary\nworks, composed dozens of poems, and authored two major histories, one\nof the Dutch rebellion against the Spanish and one of the Thirty\nYears\u2019 War. As his fame grew, Schiller was appointed professor\nof history at the University of Jena where he lectured on both history\nand aesthetics. The Robbers\u2019 message of liberation from\npolitical corruption had meanwhile been so influential that the new\nFrench Republic made Schiller an honorary citizen in 1792. But like\nmany of his contemporaries, Schiller\u2019s enthusiasm for the French\nRevolution turned to horror as the Terror began. His political\ndisillusionment was coupled with both a serious illness and a crisis\nof self-confidence in his playwriting. Schiller had already\nexperimented with philosophical prose, but this crisis inspired him to\nturn his attention fully to philosophy in the hopes of both recovering\nhis health through quiet contemplation and of gaining philosophical\ninsights that would reignite his literary talents.\n [2]\n A small pension provided by the Duke of Sachsen-Weimar made his\ntemporary withdrawal from the theater and academic life financially\npossible, and it was during this period that most of Schiller\u2019s\nremarkable theoretical output took place.\n",
