A first approach consists\nin saying that the relevant intentions of A and B do not\nrefer to their own individual walks, but to their joint walk. Instead\nof each intending to go for a walk, A and B would each\nintend the joint walk. This move is crucial to Michael Bratman\u2019s\napproach to the analysis of what he terms \u2018shared cooperative\nactivity\u2019 (cf. Bratman 1999, chaps. 5\u20138, 2006, and 2014).\nIt is based on the view that action intentions do not just come in the\nform \u201cI intend to X,\u201d as when an agent\nintends to perform some action. On Bratman\u2019s account, intentions\ncan also take the form \u201cI intend that we\nJ\u201d (cf. Bratman 1999, chap. 8), where J refers to\na joint activity in which the intending agent participates. This\nrepresents the participating agents as not just intending their\nrespective contributions, but as intending the joint activity; in the\ncase at hand, A and B are said to intend that they go\nfor a walk together. Although the focus at this point should be on\nthat core element, it is expedient to cite one version of the entire\nanalysis.\n\n\nWe intend to J if and only if\n\n (a) I intend that we J and (b) you intend that we\nJ.\n I intend that we J in accordance with and because of 1a,\n1b, and meshing subplans of 1a and 1b; you intend that we J in\naccordance with and because of 1a, 1b, and meshing subplans of 1a and\n1b.\n 1 and 2 are common knowledge between us. (Bratman 1999: 121)\n\n\n\nThis gives the structure of what Bratman calls a \u201cshared\nintention,\u201d which he takes to be an intention to J shared\nby the participants. It is depicted as consisting in a complex nexus\nof interdependent individual attitudes and not as the intention of a\ncollective agent or as a state of some collective mind (cf. Bratman\n1999: 122\u20133). For there to be a joint activity, Bratman holds,\nthe participating agents have to intend this activity in such a way\nthat their so intending is aligned both socially and with other plans\n(or subplans) on each side and that it is common knowledge between\nthem.\n\nThus, the claim here is that intentions of the form \u201cI intend\nthat we X\u201d are basic to the intentionality of joint\naction. Critics have argued that Bratman\u2019s account is defective\nin so far as it treats intentions of that form as basic, since they\nviolate either (1) the condition that one can only intend one\u2019s\nown action, or (2) the condition that one can only control one\u2019s\nown and no other agent\u2019s actions, or (3) the condition that one\ncan only intend what one can take to be in a position to settle (see\nBaier 1997; Stoutland 1997; Velleman 1997). Bratman clarifies in reply\n(in Bratman 1999, chap. 8) that intentions of the form \u201cI intend\nthat we X\u201d are formed under the assumption that the\npartner in a shared activity does or will come to intend likewise.\nInstead of positing that in order to form such an intention an agent\nhas to be certain about their partner\u2019s intentions, Bratman\ncontends that an agent is typically in a position to reliably predict\nwhether the other will come to form a corresponding intention. Given\nthat both agents form their intentions in this manner, whereby a\nshared intention comes into existence, they can both regard themselves\nas having partly settled the issue in question. On this account,\nneither of the agents controls for the other\u2019s intention\nformation or action as their intentions are each understood as\npartially constitutive of the shared intention.\n\nAnother charge against Bratman\u2019s and other accounts that ground\nan understanding of collective intentionality in individual\nagents\u2019 intentions is that such intentions are circular (cf. the\ndiscussion of Tuomela 2005 below). The idea behind this criticism is\nthat such intentions presuppose rather than constitute collective\nintentionality (cf. Schmid 2005; Petersson 2007). For how can an\nindividual refer to a joint activity without the jointness, i.e., the\n\u2018we,\u2019 already being in place? How can an agent assume that\nothers will intend likewise without presupposing the collectivity of\ntheir so intending? Instead of being foundational for shared\nintentions or collective intentionality, such intentions might turn\nout to be redundant expressions of an already existing collective\nintentionality.\n\nA reply available within Bratman\u2019s account may refer to a\npresupposition of the formation of a shared intention. According to\nBratman (1999, chap. 5), shared agency requires that the individual\nagents involved be mutually responsive, i.e., that each seeks to be\nresponsive to the other\u2019s intentions and actions and that each\nseeks to guide their own behavior with an eye to the behavior of the\nother. It is in this sense, and the phrase \u201cin accordance with\nand because of\u201d in the scheme given above signals this, that the\nways the agents involved form their respective intentions can be said\nto interconnect. Hence the idea behind this reply would be to ground\nthe intentional reference to the joint activity in mutual\nresponsiveness. (Bratman 2014, chapter 2, offers more reflections of\nthe charge of circularity; cf. Petersson 2015 for discussion.)\n\nIt is not clear whether this response can successfully deal with the\ncharge of circularity. Whereas it may be that in some scenarios the\nagents involved actually realize that they want to cooperate so that\ntheir processes of intention formation interconnect and they come to\nhave intentions as Bratman specifies them, the problem of circularity\nmay just crop up again with respect to the required interconnection.\nIt could be that instantiating interconnected processes of intention\nformation just presupposes the collectivity it is meant to\nconstitute.\n\nThe merits of Bratman\u2019s approach clearly lie in its highlighting\nthat whatever joint intentions are, they do involve interrelated\nintentional attitudes on the part of the individual agents involved.\nHowever, many critics think that treating reference to the joint\nactivity as central and at the same time retaining the\n\u2018I\u2019-form of the constitutive individual intentions makes\nfor a fundamental problem of circularity.\n\nBefore turning to a different type of account in which this particular\nproblem of circularity is (at least apparently) circumvented, it\nshould be noted that Bratman\u2019s adherence to the\n\u2018I\u2019-form of intentions is expressive of the individualism\nunderlying his approach. Already in the first statement of his account\nhe points out that it is \u201creductive in spirit\u201d (Bratman\n1999: 108) and clarifies that the core \u201cclaim [\u2026] is that\nshared intention consists primarily of attitudes of individuals and\ntheir interrelations\u201d (1999: 129). Even though Bratman has\nspecified the dimensions of the interrelations between the attitudes\nof the individual agents involved (cf. Bratman 2006), some critics\nhave taken issue with the claim that the attitudes constitutive of\nshared intentions have to stand in the singular, i.e., the\n\u2018I\u2019-form (cf. Baier 1997; Stoutland 1997; Schmid 2009;\nSchweikard 2011). This line of criticism pertains to the picture thus\ndrawn of shared intention as a social phenomenon that is constructed\nout of I-form-attitudes as building blocks, a picture that understates\nthe relevance both of relations between the individuals involved and\nof the role of social identification expressed by the use of\n\u2018we.\u2019\n",
