    "main_text": "Ethics\n5. Ethics\n\nTsongkhapa is part of a long, shared, Indo-Tibetan Buddhist tradition\nthat conceives of ethical conduct not in absolute terms, but in the\ncontext of different individuals in different situations. There is an\nunspoken presupposition that ethical statements are grounded in\nreality, in the sense that suffering (Sk. du\u1e25kha) comes\nfrom actions (Sk. karma) that are not in accord with the way\nthings actually are (Tib. dngos po'i gnas lugs). The person\nis ultimately not present as an ethical subject, but is so, on a\nconventional or covering level, through the natural working of\ndependent origination.\n\nTsongkhapa groups such individuals into three separate categories\n(those who privilege basic Buddhist codes, bodhisattvas, and\nt\u0101ntrikas). Each is governed by an ethical code (Tib. sdom\ngsum), each superior code subsuming the points of the lesser.\nBeyond these three, his Great Exposition suggests ordinary\nethical conduct is codified as well, in the main, in the ten ethical\npoints (Sk. da\u015ba-ku\u015bala-patha) basic to any human\nlife that rises above the mere animal.\n\nThe first of the three specifically Buddhist codes, the basic code,\nprimarily governs the behavior of monks and nuns. Since for Tsongkhapa\neach higher code incorporates all the rules in the lower code, he\nconceives of the seven (or even twelve) sub-codes making up the basic\ncode as, in descending order, containing fewer and fewer of the rules\nthat constitute the full code. Each of the sub-codes is designed for\nparticular people in particular human situations. Tsongkhapa does not\nexpect a butcher to be governed by the rule of not killing, for\nexample, and he does not expect a lawyer to be governed by the rule of\nnot lying. He avoids gross devaluation of the basic code by\nprivileging spiritual elites. In this, he takes a pragmatic approach\nto ethics in line with his non-absolutist stance. For Tsongkhapa, it\nis axiomatic that human life is not ipso facto privileged\nabove any other form of life, but his detailed explanation gives\ngreater \u201cweight\u201d to the karmic retribution that comes from\nkilling humans, and amongst humans, noble persons, for example, than\nless fortunate forms of life.\n\nTsongkhapa's explanation of the bodhisattva moral code presented in\nthe Bodhisattva-bh\u016bmi (Tatz 1987) follows naturally from\nthe importance he gives to the altruistic principle\n(bodhicitta) in his other writing. He reconciles rules in the\nbodhisattva code that enjoin behavior contradicting the basic code by\npositing an elite that, through a noblesse oblige of the\nspiritually advanced, are required to do things which would be\nunethical in an ordinary person. Their not doing so constitutes an\nethical lapse. For example, the basic code prohibits actions that\ninfluence what food a donor puts in the begging bowl (with a few\nexceptions for human flesh and so on), and prohibits eating after\nnoon. The bodhisattva code contradicts the basic code insofar as it\nprohibits eating meat, even though, by so doing, the donor does not\nget the opportunity to make charity. Tsongkhapa argues that if a monk\nat the bodhisattva stage of development eats meat it clashes with the\ndictates of the altruistic principle (bodhicitta).\n\nTsongkhapa accepts that the diverse body of literature, including the\nhistorically latest Buddhist tantras (some of which are distinctly\nantinomian in character), are the work of a fully awakened being (Sk.\nbuddha). The last of the three codes systematizes the conduct\nespoused in these tantras. Tsongkhapa's presentation is distinctive\nfor finding a code complete with a full ordination ceremony. The\npractical result of his presentation is to revalue the basic code for\nmonks, and devalue the ritual of tantric consecration as it pertains\nto ethical conduct. It stresses ethical conduct even in the context of\nworks that appear, in line with the nihilistic drift of Buddhist\nphilosophy, to count ethical codes as a block to the highest spiritual\nand philosophical attainment.\n\nFor Tsongkhapa the tantric code is only for the very highest spiritual\nelite, mainly monks and nuns. Tsongkhapa divides tantras into two\nsections, and says the lower section is governed exclusively by the\nbodhisattva code, supplemented by specific ritual injunctions (Sk.\nvrata). He gives two interpretations of the rules for the\nhigher tantras, reserving the truly antinomian behavior for a\ntheoretical elite whose altruism is so strong, and whose understanding\nand status is so ennobled, that they engage in what ordinarily would\nbe condemned as gross immorality. According to this code, it is an\nethical lapse not to eat meat, perhaps even human flesh, the logic\nbeing that in certain specific and unusual circumstances, in a person\nat this stage of development, such behavior would constitute a\nskillful means to benefit others.\n",
