    "main_text": "Models of Global Democracy || Radical Democracy\n2.5 Radical Democracy\n\n\nThis model is grounded in an ethics of revolution, in which\nautonomous, self-governing communities can resist and overthrow the\nglobal system of sovereignty and its hierarchical capitalist relations\n(Bray and Slaughter forthcoming, 158). Variants on this position have\nbeen promoted by Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri, Chantal Mouffe, and\nJan Aart Scholte. The fundamental normative claim is that collectives\ncan only be emancipated through the rejection of capitalism, property\nrights, and class-based notions of governance. In other words, these\nstructures create systems of domination and alienation that need to be\novercome. According to Hardt and Negri (2000), communities and social\nmovements should challenge the current liberal order of politics and\nseek new forms of global governance based on cooperation, affection,\nand nature. This model has close connections with direct forms of\ndemocracy.\n\n\nThe institutional design of radical democracy is, almost by\ndefinition, underspecified. Proponents argue against the existing\nglobal system in which sovereignty has been eclipsed by empire: the\nsubservience of politics to capitalism. It is therefore up to\ncollectives to overhaul current arrangements and establish new forms\nof governance, the design of which can only emerge through the process\nof reconstruction itself.  Both Chantal Mouffe (2009) and Jan Aart\nScholte (2014) are clear that radical democracy entails the rejection\nof Western, liberal democratic institutions (such as parliaments and\nconstitutions) and their reliance on individualism and\ncapitalism. Rather, Scholte (2014) argues that we should open up our\nconception of how global democracy should look to take due\nconsideration of transscalarity, plural solidarities,\ntransculturality, egalitarian distribution, and ecology that\nconstitute social and material life.\n\n\nIn terms of feasibility, it is difficult to know how radical global\ndemocracy might come about. Although we can point at potential\nexamples\u2014such as the Occupy Wall Street movement or the\nZapatista Army\u2014concrete institutional moments are difficult to\ncome by. Moreover, radical democrats are often quick to note that\nglobalization has been coopted by capitalism, and that it reinforces\ncolonial legacies in developing countries. It is hard to comprehend\nhow collectives of free and equal individuals can form in a\ntransnational context where much of the global South is removed from\nthe technological and communicative benefits of\nglobalization. Paradoxically, then, the groups most in need of\ndemocratic revolution are precisely those groups with less access to\nmeans of transnational activism (the Internet, attending global\nprotests, signing petitions, etc.). Finally, on the issue of\ndesirability, there is little guarantee that a revolution will lead to\na better state of global democracy. Revolutions are by definition\ndisruptive, and although capitalism comes with many problems, it is\nconceivable that the revolutionary outcome of radical democracy may be\nmore deleterious than the current state of affairs.\n",
