Rossetti shared with Edward FitzGerald and their mutual admiration of Khayyam cannot be ignored. The salient themes of the Rub\u0101\u2018iyy\u0101t became popular among the Pre-Raphaelites and their circle (Lange 1968). Khayyam\u2019s popularity led to the formation of the \u201cOmar Khayy\u0101m Club of London\u201d (Conway 1893, 305) in 1892, which attracted a number of literary figures and intellectuals. The success of the Club soon led to the simultaneous formation of the Omar Khayy\u0101m Clubs of Germany and America.\nIn America, Umar Khayyam was well received in the New England area where his poetry was propagated by the official members of the Omar Khayy\u0101m Club of America. The academic community discovered Khayyam\u2019s mathematical writings and poetry in the 1880s, when his scholarly articles and translations of his works were published. Some, such as William Edward Story, praised Umar as a mathematician and compared his views with those of Johannes Kepler, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, and Isaac Newton, while others drew their inspiration from his literary tradition and called themselves \u201cUmarians.\u201d This new literary movement soon attracted such figures as Mark Twain, who composed forty-five burlesque versions of FitzGerald\u2019s quatrains and integrated them with two of FitzGerald\u2019s stanzas entitled AGE-A Ruba\u2018iyat (Twain, 1983, 14). The movement also drew the attention of T.S. Eliot\u2019s grandfather William Greenleaf Eliot (1811\u20131887), two of T.S. Eliot\u2019s cousins, and T.S. Eliot himself. Umar Khayyam\u2019s Rub\u0101\u2018iyy\u0101t seems to have elicited two distinct responses among many of his followers in general and the Eliot family in particular: admiration for a rational theology on the one hand, and concern with the rise of skepticism and moral decay in America on the other.\nAmong other figures influenced by the Rub\u0101\u2018iyy\u0101t of Umar Khayyam were certain members of the New England School of Transcendentalism, including Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Henry David Thoreau (Aminrazavi 2013; for a complete discussion on Umar Khayyam in the West see Aminrazavi 2007, 204\u2013278).\n",
