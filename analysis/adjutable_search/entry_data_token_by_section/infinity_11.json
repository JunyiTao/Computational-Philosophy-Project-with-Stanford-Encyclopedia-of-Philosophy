    "main_text": "Mathematics: number systems, Cantor\u2019s paradise, and beyond || Wrapup\n3.5 Wrapup\n\nLet us take stock. In response to worries that infinities in\nmathematics are suspect (section\n 2),\n rigorous mathematical theories of infinity have been developed (this\nsection). But one might worry that, even if we can talk with\nmathematical rigor about infinities, they do not correspond to or\napply to anything in the real world (as we think finite quantities do,\nhowever they do). Infinities might just be castles in the sky.\nFurthermore, one might suspect that we can, by some further\nmathematical developments, remove any reference to infinities in any\npractically important mathematics. The following section places this\ndialectic in the context of general questions about mathematical\nontology, canvassing some important historical attempts to expunge the\ninfinite from mathematics. It then explains the very\ndifficult\u2014perhaps insurmountable\u2014challenges that any such\nattempt faces.\n",
