    "main_text": "Objections and Replies || Anarchism is Incoherent\n4.5 Philosophical Anarchism is \u201cToothless\u201d\n\nObjection: One objection to philosophical anarchism\nof the sort discussed throughout this essay is that it remains merely\ntheoretical. Some political anarchists have little patience for\nabstract discourses that do not engage in direct action. One worry\nabout philosophical anarchism is that in failing to act\u2014and in\nfailing to take responsibility for the actions that ought to follow\nfrom thought\u2014philosophical anarchism remains a bourgeois\nconvenience that actually serves the status quo. Thus when\nphilosophical anarchists remain uncommitted in terms of the concrete\nquestions raised by anarchism\u2014whether they should obey the law,\nwhether they should vote, and so on\u2014they tend to support the\ninterests of defenders of the status quo.\n\nReply: In response to this objection, one might\ndefend the importance of philosophical reflection. It is important to\nbe clear about principles and ideas before taking action. And with\nanarchism the stakes are quite high. The puzzles created by\nphilosophical anarchism are profound. They lead us to question\ntraditional notions of sovereignty, political obligation, and so on.\nThey lead us to wonder about cultural and ethical conventions,\nincluding also our first principles regarding the theory and\norganization of social life. Given the difficulty of resolving many of\nthese questions, the philosophical anarchist may hold that caution is\nin order. Moreover, the philosophical anarchist might also defend the\nimportance of wonder. The anarchist critique gives us reason to wonder\nabout much that we take for granted. Wonder may not change the world\nin immediate ways or lead to direct action. But wonder is an important\nstep in the direction of thoughtful, ethical action.\n",
