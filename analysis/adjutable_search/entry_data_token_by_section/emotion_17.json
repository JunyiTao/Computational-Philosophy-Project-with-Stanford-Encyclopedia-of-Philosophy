    "main_text": "Rationality and Emotions || Instrumental and Substantive Strategic Rationality\n11. Concluding Remarks\n\nOne may be tempted to conclude from this overview of emotion theories\nacross disciplines that the field is deeply divided on just about\neverything. This would be hasty. Despite the great diversity of views\non the nature and function of emotions we have documented, a broad\nconsensus has emerged on a number of topics. Here is a tentative list\nof what a plurality of emotion theorists agree about, with brief\nmention of where the disagreements begin:\n\n Emotion episodes involve, at least in prototypical cases, a set\nof evaluative, physiological, phenomenological, expressive,\nbehavioral, and mental components that are diagnostic of emotions and\nare to some degree correlated with one another.\n\n\n The degree to which these correlations are instantiated continues\nto be a central topic of theoretical debate: latent variable models\nassume that emotions cause the changes in components and expect to\nfind strong correlations, whereas emergent variable models assume that\nemotions emerge from changes in components caused by something other\nthan emotions and expect to find weak correlations.\n\n Token episodes of the same folk emotion type (e.g., anger, fear,\nshame) manifest a great deal of variability with respect to\nexpressive, behavioral, physiological and phenomenological features,\nas well as intensity, duration, valence, arousal, type and range of\nintentional objects.\n\n\n Researchers disagree on whether underlying all this variability\nthere exist measurable bodily patterns of some kind that are still\ndistinctive of different emotions.\n\n Emotions have intentionality or the ability to represent.\n\n\n Researchers disagree on whether emotions represent descriptively\nor imperatively or both, on what exact contents they represent, and on\nwhat grounds the emotion-world representation relation. A small\nminority of researchers, hailing mostly from the enactivist movement,\nhave argued that emotions lack representational qualities.\n\n The physical seat of emotions is the brain, but there are no\nneural circuits that correspond one-to-one with any folk emotion type,\nand brains are embodied and embedded in environments that are essential to their\nproper functioning.\n\n\n Researchers disagree on how exactly the brain implements tokens\nof different emotion types, and whether emotional phenomena are best\nunderstood in terms of emotion-specific or emotion-unspecific neural\nmechanisms.\n\n Emotions typically involve conscious experiences, but such\nexperiences are not strictly necessary for an emotion to be\ninstantiated, in part because some emotion terms refer to dispositions\nand in part because most theorists consider feelings conceptually\ndistinct from non-dispositional emotions.\n\n\n A handful of influential researchers such as LeDoux (2017) and\nBarrett (2017) continue to identify emotions with conscious\nexperiences.\n\n Evolutionary and socio-cultural considerations must both\ncontribute to our understanding of a great many emotions\u2019\nfunctions. These are both intra-personal functions \u2014e.g., helping organisms\ncoordinate organismic resources to deal with urgent demands\u2014and\ninterpersonal functions \u2014e.g., communicating information useful for the\nnegotiation of social transactions.\n\n\n Researchers continue to debate whether there is sufficient\nempirical evidence for basic emotions and other special-purpose emotion\nmechanisms. Some see the role of evolution as limited to the shaping\nof general-purpose adaptations, such as core affect and the ability to\ncategorize, which jointly lead to the emergence of emotions.\n\n Emotions are no longer considered structurally opposed to reason\n\n\n Researchers continue to debate the circumstances in which\nemotions manifest various kinds of cognitive and strategic\nirrationality.\n\n Emotions can be appropriate or inappropriate with respect to\ntheir intentional objects\n\n\n Researchers debate the grounds of, and distinctions between,\ndifferent forms of appropriateness (e.g., fittingness, moral\nappropriateness).\n\n Emotions typically involve appraisals of the significance of the\nstimulus situation, ranging between primitive and sophisticated forms\nof information processing.\n\n\n Researchers debate what the structure of appraisals is, and\nwhether appraisals cause or constitute emotions or both. \n\n Emotions typically correlate with changes in motivation to do\nthings.\n\n\n Some researchers think emotions cause or consist in such changes\nin motivation, whereas others think that changes in motivation have\nother causes, or are too unspecific to ground a theory of what\nemotions are. \n\n\n\nThe exploration of these insights and the resolution of the\ndisagreements around them is a thriving interdisciplinary project in\ncontemporary emotion theory. Philosophers and affective scientists\nwill continue to engage in it for years to come, putting their\ndistinctive theoretical skills at the service of projects of common\ninterest. \n",
