    "main_text": "The Paradox of Suspense\n1. The Paradox of Suspense\n\n\nCognitive psychologists Ortony, Clore, and Collins put forth a useful\ntheory of suspense that we might call the standard account. They \nargue that suspense is composed of fear, hope, and the \u201ccognitive \nstate of uncertainty\u201d (131). They define fear as a feeling of \ndispleasure about the prospect of an undesirable event; and hope as a\nfeeling of pleasure about the prospect of a desirable event. On the \nstandard account, people feel suspense when they fear a bad outcome, \nhope for a good outcome, and are uncertain about which outcome will \ncome to pass. In real life, we might feel suspense when walking \nthrough an unfamiliar, reputedly dangerous neighborhood at night. We \nfear that we might be mugged, hope that we will be safe, and are \nuncertain which will occur. \n\n\nOrtony, Clore, and Collins argue that as \u201cprospect emotions,\u201d fear \nand hope depend on the desirability and likelihood of a prospective \noutcome\u2014the yet to be determined outcome of an event. For \nexample, fear is amplified as the degree of danger, the \nundesirability and/or likelihood of an outcome, increases. If I am \nfearful of being attacked, I am more fearful if the prospective \nattack is more undesirable: Given equal likelihood, I would be more \nfearful of being stabbed in the gut with a knife or a beaten about \nthe torso with a pillowcase full of oranges than merely punched \nrepeatedly. Similarly, the more likely I believe an undesirable \noutcome to be, the more fearful I may be of that outcome. The \nconverse is true concerning hope: The more desirable and likely an \noutcome seems the more hopeful we may feel. \n\n\nThe intensity of our feelings of suspense seems to rely on two \nfeatures of an event\u2019s outcome: (1) its uncertainty and (2) the \nsignificance of what is at stake. Although the standard view does not\nclaim a direct relationship between uncertainty, what is at stake, \nand suspense, it does suggest that the greatest suspense is felt in \ncases where the outcome is very uncertain and the stakes are very \nhigh. The standard view also tells us that you can have suspense with\nlow stakes if there is great uncertainty, or with low uncertainty if \nthere are high stakes. However, on the standard view, if there is no \nuncertainty, there can be no suspense. Similarly, if nothing is at \nstake, there can be no desirable or undesirable outcome, hence no \nfear or hope, and consequently no suspense. \n\n\nThe preceding analysis of suspense generates a \ntroublesome paradox. If uncertainty is required in order for one to \nfeel suspense, how is it that some narrative artworks can still \nseem suspenseful on repeated encounters? For example, if we have \nalready seen a movie, and we remember it well, then we are certain \nhow it will end. Although we may not feel suspense as intensely as we\ndid upon first viewing, it is undeniable that we can feel some \nsuspense upon repeated viewings. But if suspense requires \nuncertainty, it should be impossible to feel suspense during \nsubsequent viewings. This problem is known as the paradox of \nsuspense. It can be stated more formally as follows: \n\nSuspense requires uncertainty.\nKnowledge of a story\u2019s outcome precludes uncertainty.\nPeople feel suspense in response to some stories when they have knowledge of the outcome.\n\n\n\nAlthough none of these claims seems objectionable in isolation, \ntogether, they are inconsistent. The four solutions to the paradox \nthat I discuss in the next section each question one or another of \nthe claims that make up the paradox. The entertained uncertainty and \ndesire-frustration theories reject the first claim. The \nmoment-by-moment forgetting theory rejects the second premise. And \nthe emotional misidentification theory takes issue with the third. \n",
