    "main_text": "The Cognitive Science of Creativity || Insight\n5.3 Insight\n\nIt should be intuitive that creativity often involves solving problems\nand doing so in interesting or surprising ways. In exceptional cases,\nthe individual identifies a problem solution that perhaps no one\n(including the creator) anticipated. But there are countless examples\nof more mundane instances of problem solving, where the solution may\nbe surprising (or especially interesting) to only a few individuals,\nperhaps even only to the problem solver. One broad, standard\nexperimental method used by researchers thus focuses on\ninsight in problem solving. Some problems (thankfully!) can\nbe solved by straightforward appeal to memory, or by applying some\ntechnique or method of calculation in a mechanical way. Solving the\nproblem may still take time and effort, but the solution will come so\nlong as one executes the appropriate strategy or applies the relevant\nknowledge from memory. An insight problem, by contrast, typically\nrequires something new on the part of the individual, and one must\noften \u201cchange views\u201d of the structure of the very problem.\nPredictably, there are a variety of definitions or characterizations\nof \u201cinsight\u201d in the literature. Here are two recent,\nrepresentative examples. Bowden et al. suggest that insight occurs\n\n\nwhen a solver breaks free of unwarranted assumptions, or forms novel,\ntask-related connections between existing concepts or skills. (Bowden\net al. 2005: 322)\n\n\nMore recently, Kounios and Beeman write,\n\n\nwe define insight as any sudden comprehension, realization, or problem\nsolution that involves a reorganization of the elements of a\nperson\u2019s mental representation of a stimulus, situation, or\nevent to yield a nonobvious or nondominant interpretation. (2014:\n74)\n\n\nSome early studies on these phenomena centered around a familiar\nobservation. Consider the tip-of the-tongue phenomenon, when you know\nthat you know some bit of information (an actor\u2019s name or the\ntitle of a song) but, try as you may, you just can\u2019t recall it.\nIt often helps to give up for a moment and allow the memory to surface\nwithout effort. Researchers found that the same\napproach\u2014forgetting about a problem\u2014works well to overcome\nfixation on ineffective ideas so as to allow the actual solution to\npop up. Smith and Blankenship primed two groups of subjects with\ninappropriate or misleading solutions to problems. They left one group\nto continue struggling with the same problem, while they distracted\nthe second group with a distinct but cognitively demanding task. The\nsecond group thereby overcame fixation and outperformed the first\ngroup when returning attention to the original target problem (Smith\n& Blankenship 1989, 1991; see also Smith, Ward, & Finke\n1995).\n\nIn the context of creativity in particular, there is precedent, or at\nleast overlap, in Colin Martindale\u2019s cortical arousal theory.\nThis theory centers around the nature of focuses of attention\n(Martindale 1977, 1981, 1995, 1999; Martindale & Armstrong 1974;\nMartindale & Hines 1975). Martindale proposes a multi-stage model\nof problem solving, which if the right mechanism is possessed, leads\nto creative thought. In the initial stages, information is gathered,\nvarious approaches are taken to the problem, and there is a high level\nof cortical arousal with a narrow focus of attention. As information\nincreases and the problem remains unsolved, two kinds of responses may\noccur. The first kind of response is to keep attempting the same\nsolutions to the problem such that the arousal and attention focus\nstay high and narrow, respectively. Alternatively, some persons\nexperience a decrease in cortical arousal coupled with a wider range\nof attention focus. Information then enters what Martindale calls\nprimary processing: a kind of subconscious cognition not under the\ncomplete control of the agent. It is this kind of processing, and the\narousal mechanisms that enable it, that distinguish creative insight\nor achievement from non-creative ones. The first kind of response\ntypically results in frustration and failure (fixation), while the\nsecond often results in creative insight.\n\nThere are at least two, separable components of insight thus\nunderstood. First, an insight problem requires non-mechanical or\nnon-algorithmic solution, and this in turn requires some kind of\nconceptual reorganization. A hackneyed phrase may come to mind here:\none has to \u201cthink outside the box\u201d.\n\nThe second element of insight as understood here is subjective or\nphenomenological. An insightful problem solution is often described as\noccurring suddenly and with little or no apparent effort. It is an aha\nmoment, even if less dramatic than the traditionally romanticized\nEureka moment. One way researchers have tested for this subjective\nfeature is to ask subjects to report nearness or \u201cwarmth\u201d\nrelative to solving a problem. They find that for insight problems, by\ncontrast to non-insight problems, subjects report that as they near\nsolution they experience abrupt changes in the sense of warmth for\nsolving the problem (Metcalfe & Wiebe 1987; see also Dominowski\n1995; Laukkonen & Tangen 2018). More recently, researchers have\nbegun to employ neuroimaging techniques to study insight and\ninsightful problem solving (Luo & Niki 2003; Mai et al. 2004).\n\nFirst, researchers have developed methods for using subjective report,\nwhere subjects rate whether they felt that they used insight in\nsolving a designated problem (Bowden et al. 2005). And second, and\ncoupled with those report methods, researchers have developed simple\nproblems that can be solved with insight. One such example is the\n\u201cCompound remote associates problem\u201d (CRA). Here is an\nexample of a CRA problem:\n\n\nEach of the three words in (a) and (b) below can form a compound word\nor two-word phrase with the solution word. The solution word can come\nbefore or after any of the problem words.\n\nfrench, car, shoe\nboot, summer,\n ground[1]\n\n\n(Bowden et al. 2005: 324)\n\n\nBecause of their simplicity, these problems can be solved\nunambiguously and quickly, and with this speed comes better potential\nfor neuroimaging study. In instances where subjects report insight\nsolutions to these kinds of problems,\n\n\nEEG shows a burst of high-frequency (gamma-band) EEG activity over the\nright temporal lobe, and fMRI shows a corresponding change in blood\nflow in the medial aspect of the right anterior superior temporal\ngyrus (Jung-Beeman et al. 2004). (Kounios & Beeman 2014: 78)\n\n\nThe question for neuroscientists is whether this convergence of\nevidence is sufficient to establish neural correlates of insight.\n",
