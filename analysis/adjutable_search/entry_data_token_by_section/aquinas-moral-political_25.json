This does\nnot mean that moral principles all apply to public authority in the\nway they do to private persons; they do not, yet there is no exemption\nof public authorities from the exceptionless moral norms against\nintentionally killing the innocent, lying, rape and other\nextra-marital sex, and so forth. Moreover, this limitation has no\nbearing on the distinct question which moral standards should, or can\nproperly, be legally enforced by the state\u2019s government and law\n(see (iii) below).\n\n(ii) State governments are subject to laws governing election or other\nappointment to and tenure and rotation of office, and the jurisdiction\nof particular offices. Even supreme rulers not subject to the coercive\nauthority of anyone else cannot dispense themselves from the\nobligation of their own laws unless that is for the common good and\nfree from favoritism. If they defy these moral restrictions they show\nthemselves to be tyrants, and may be resisted and deposed by the\nconcerted (\u201cpublic\u201d) action of their people. The best form\nof government (or as we would now say, constitution) is one in which,\n\u201cwell mixed\u201d, are found \u201cmonarchy\u201d,\n\u201caristocracy\u201d and \u201cdemocracy\u201d, that is, the\nrule of one person (whose \u201cmonarchy\u201d is probably\nbetter elective rather than hereditary), governing in concert with a\nfew high officials chosen for their excellence of character\nand aptitude, by an electorate comprising the many who are\nentitled both to vote and to stand for election: ST I-II q.\n105 a. 1. Establishing and maintaining such an arrangement is a matter\nfor laws which delimit the competences of all concerned.\n\n(iii) State governments and laws have the authority and duty to\npromote and defend the common good, including the good of virtue. This\nresponsibility brings with it the authority to use coercion for the\nsuppression of crime and enemy attack. This coercive jurisdiction\nextends to defending persons and property both by force and by the\ncredible threat of punishment for criminal or other unjust\nappropriation or damage. But it does not extend to enforcing any part\nof morality other than the requirements of justice insofar as\nthey can be violated by acts external to the choosing and\nacting person\u2019s will. Acts of virtues (or vices) other than such\nexternal acts of inter-personal (in)justice cannot rightly be\nprohibited unless they involve (in)justice. For, unlike\ndivine law\u2019s, \u201chuman law\u2019s purpose is the temporal\ntranquility of the state, a purpose which the law attains by\ncoercively prohibiting external acts to the extent that these\nevils can disturb the peaceful state of the state.\u201d ST\nI-II q. 98 a. 1c; likewise q. 100 a. 2c: \u201chuman law does not put\nforward precepts about anything other than acts of justice [and\ninjustice]\u201d. State law\u2019s justifiedly coercive domain is\nnot private good as such, nor the whole of the community\u2019s\ncommon good. Rather, it is those aspects of the political\ncommunity\u2019s common good that can be called public good, and that\nare affected by external acts directly or indirectly affecting other\nmembers of the community.\n\n(iv) The morally significant authority of the state\u2019s government\nand law is limited by the rights of the Church, though when that\ngovernment and law are within their proper domain, one ought to comply\nwith their directives rather than any purported act of administration\nor government (apart from general moral teaching) by Pope or\nbishops.\n\nThe last three kinds of limitation can be considered here in a little\nmore detail.\n",
