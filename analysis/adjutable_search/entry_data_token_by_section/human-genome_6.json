Keeping track of the origin of the\nDNA that is studied will be important, but the DNA can come from\ndifferent persons chosen for study for particular parts of the\ngenome\u201d (p. 913). The HGP and Celera reference sequences are\nindeed composites based on chromosomal segments that originate from\ndifferent individuals: the sequence in any given region of the genome\nbelongs to a single individual, but sequences in different regions of\nthe genome belong to different individuals. However, in both cases,\nthe majority of the sequence originates from just one person. As HGP\nsequencing efforts accelerated, concerns arose that only four genomes,\na couple of which belonged to known laboratory personnel, were being\nused for physical mapping and sequencing (Marshall 1996a). The\ndecision was made to construct 10 new clone libraries for sequencing\nwith each library contributing about 10 percent of the total DNA. In\nthe end, 74.3 percent of the total number of bases sequenced was\nderived from a single clone library\u2014that of a male, presumably\nfrom the Buffalo area; seven other clone libraries contributed to an\nadditional 17.3 percent of the sequence (International Human Genome\nSequencing Consortium 2001, p. 866). A similar proportion\u2014close\nto 71 percent\u2014of the Celera sequence belongs to just one male\neven though five ethnically diverse donors were selected; incredibly\nenough, rumors were eventually confirmed that this individual is\nVenter himself (McKie 2002).\n\nThe deeper question, of course, is how we might understand a single\nhuman genome sequence, a composite that belongs to no actual\nindividual in its entirety and only a handful of individuals in its\nparts, to be representative of the entire species. This seems to\nignore the extensive genetic variability that exists. Early critics of\nthe HGP pointed out numerous faults with the concept of a\nrepresentative or putatively normal genome: many DNA polymorphisms are\nfunctionally equivalent (Sarkar and Tauber 1991); the genome sequence\nwill contain unknown defective genes (since no one, including donors,\nis free of these), and it is impossible to identify the genetic basis\nof a disorder simply by comparing the sequences of sick and well\npeople since there will be many differences between them (Lewontin\n2000 [1992]); and from an evolutionary viewpoint, mutations are not\n\u201cerrors\u201d in the genetic code or \u201cdamage\u201d to\nthe genome\u2019s structure, but the genetic variants that provide\nthe raw materials that make it possible for new species to arise\n(Limoges 1994, p. 124). There were related worries that the human\ngenome reference sequence would arbitrate a standard of genetic\nnormality; for example, the application of concepts like\n\u201cgenetic error\u201d and \u201cdamage\u201d to the genome\ninstitutes a call for correction or repair (Limoges 1994; also Murphy\n1994). Indeed, the 1988 Office for Technology Assessment report on the\nHGP recommended the \u201ceugenic use of genetic information \u2026\nto ensure \u2026 that each individual has at least a modicum of\nnormal genes\u201d (p. 85).\n\nScience named \u201chuman genetic variation\u201d as\n\u201cBreakthrough of the Year\u201d for 2007. Humans have been\nfound to be 99.9 percent alike genetically, but notable for the\nmagazine was the extent to which individuals had been found to differ\ngenetically from one another\u2014in SNPs, insertions, deletions, and\nother structural elements\u2014and the promise this apparently\nunexpected amount of variation holds for using genome-wide association\nstudies (GWAS) to discover the genetic bases for complex traits, both\ndisease and non-disease traits, to which multiple genetic and\nnongenetic factors contribute. The human genome reference sequence has\nbeen useful as a tool for discovering and cataloguing that genetic\nvariation by providing a standard shared by the scientific community:\n\u201cThe current reference genome assembly works as the foundation\nfor all genomic data and databases. It provides a scaffold for genome\nassembly, variant calling, RNA or other sequencing read alignment,\ngene annotation, and functional analysis. Genes are referred to by\ntheir loci, with their base positions defined by reference genome\ncoordinates. Variants and alleles are labeled as such when compared to\nthe reference (i.e., reference (REF) versus alternative (ALT)).\nDiploid and personal genomes are assembled using the reference as a\nscaffold, and RNA-seq reads are typically mapped to the reference\ngenome\u201d (Ballouz et al. 2019, p. 159). However, what had\nportrayed as a journalist\u2019s or philosopher\u2019s question is\nnow being asked by genome scientists too. Even as a tool, there are\nchallenges to overcome. If alleles included in the reference sequence\nare relatively rare, \u201creference bias\u201d is introduced:\ngenomes that resemble the reference genome are easier to assemble and\nalign, and variants are missed or misidentified (Ballouz et al. 2019).\nAnd when entire stretches of sequence are missing in the reference\nsequence, those sequences will be discarded and missed entirely\nbecause of the reliance on the genome reference sequence for\nassembling and aligning sequenced genomes (Sherman and Salzberg\n2020).\n\nSince 2003, there have been ongoing efforts to update the human genome\nreference sequence by filling gaps, correcting errors, and replacing\nminor alleles (the current version of the reference sequence is\nGRCh38). Diversity has been incorporated in the reference sequence by\ntacking on additional sequences, but by maintaining a linear\nrepresentation, this loses location information (Kaye and Wasserman\n2021). Suggestions have been made for ways to further improve the\ngenome reference sequence. Recently developed long read sequencing\ntechnologies facilitate the discovery of large structural variants\n(SVs) and not just genetic variants (i.e., SNPs and smaller insertions\nand deletions, or \u201cindels\u201d). One suggestion calls for\n\u201creconstructing a more precise canonical human reference\ngenome\u201d by using those SVs to correct misassemblies in the\nreference sequence and adding the more common SVs to improve variant\ndetection (Yang et al. 2019). Another suggestion recommends adopting a\n\u201cconsensus sequence\u201d approach, in which the most common\nalleles and variants in the population are chosen for inclusion\n(Ballouz et al. 2019). Problems remain, however: these remain\ncomposite genomes and may contain sequences that would not be found\ntogether in any individual, and ongoing updates undermine the\nstability of the reference sequence as a reference (Kaye and Wasserman\n2021). Suggestions have also been made for the replacement of the\ngenome reference sequence. Long read sequencing allows the\n\u201cde novo assembly\u201d of genomes, which obviates\nneed of the reference sequence for scaffolding (Chiasson et al. 2015).\nA human \u201cpan-genome\u201d would accommodate variation by\nserving as a collection of all the DNA sequences found in the species,\nboth SVs and genetic variants, and replace a linear representation of\nthe genome with more complex genome graphs (Sherman and Salzberg 2020;\nMiga and Wang 2021). Another possibility is \u201cThe Genome\nAtlas,\u201d which foregoes use of the reference sequence even as a\ncoordinate system, with entries in the atlas instead features of the\ngenome assigned unique feature object identifiers (FOIs). The database\ngenerates blueprint genomes based on selected features for use in\nsequencing reads (Kaye and Wasserman 2021).\n\nPhilosophical concerns about whether a human genome reference sequence\narbitrates a standard of genetic normality remain, though these may be\nmitigated by the pan-genome and genome atlas approaches. An\nempirically validated consensus sequence approach that includes the\nmost common alleles and variants in the population in the genome\nreference sequence does not imply that those alleles and variants are\nof biomedical significance because they are conducive to health or of\nevolutionary significance because they are ancestral.\nScience\u2019s 18 February 2011 issue in celebration of the\n10-year anniversary of publication of the draft human genome sequence\ncontains an essay by genome scientist Maynard V. Olson, which asks, in\nits title, \u201cWhat Does a \u2018Normal\u2019 Human Genome Look\nLike?\u201d Although the HGP was criticized as anti-evolutionary,\npre-Darwinian, typological, and essentialist for seemingly instituting\na standard of genetic normality, it was also argued that the HGP might\nbe seen instead as incorporating a specific set of evolutionary\nassumptions (Gannett 2003). Indeed, from an evolutionary perspective,\nOlson contends that genetic variability among relatively healthy\nhumans is largely composed of deleterious mutations, rather than\nadaptive mutations due to balancing or diversifying selection, and\nthat, consequently, \u201cthere actually is a \u2018wild-type\u2019\nhuman genome\u2014one in which most genes exist in an evolutionarily\noptimized form\u201d (p. 872), though individual humans inevitably\n\u201cfall short of this Platonic ideal.\u201d Judgments about what\nconstitutes a \u201cnormal,\u201d \u201cwild-type,\u201d or\n\u201cideal\u201d human genome do not escape the socio-cultural\ncontexts in which they arise. Social and cultural values that attach\nto judgements at the phenotypic level are simply embedded in the\ngenome, where they are less visible as such (Gannett 1998).\n\nIn promoting the HGP, Gilbert (1992) suggested that we will find\nanswers to the age-old question about human nature in our genome:\n\u201cAt the end of the genome project, we will want to be able to\nidentify all the genes that make up a human being\u2026. So by\ncomparing a human to a primate, we will be able to identify the genes\nthat encode the features of primates and distinguish them from other\nmammals. Then, by tweaking our computer programs, we will finally\nidentify the regions of DNA that differ between the primate and the\nhuman\u2014and understand those genes that make us uniquely\nhuman\u201d (p. 94). Although philosophers challenge the species\nessentialism that defines species in terms of genetic properties\nshared by all and only their members (Gannett 2003; Robert and Baylis\n2003), genome scientists are indeed comparing the human genome\nreference sequence to chimpanzee, bonobo, and Neandertal genome\nreference sequences to explore questions about human nature. Already\nin 1969, Sinsheimer foresaw the promise of molecular biology to remake\nhuman nature: \u201cFor the first time in all time, a living creature\nunderstands its origin and can undertake to design its future\u201d\n(in Kevles 1992, p. 18). Remaking human nature is likely to begin with\ngenetic modifications that convey the possibility of resistance to a\nserious disease, like HIV/AIDS, or minimize the effects of aging to\nextend lifespan, but transhumanists who view human nature as \u201ca\nwork-in-progress, a half-baked beginning that we can learn to remold\nin desirable ways\u201d welcome improvements in memory, intelligence,\nand emotional capacities as well (Bostrom 2003, p. 493). Theories of\njustice are typically based on conceptions of human nature; although\nthe new field of sociogenomics continues to favor nature over nurture\n(Bliss 2018), with the capacity to remake human nature, this\nfoundation disappears (Fukuyama 2002; Habermas 2003).\n",
