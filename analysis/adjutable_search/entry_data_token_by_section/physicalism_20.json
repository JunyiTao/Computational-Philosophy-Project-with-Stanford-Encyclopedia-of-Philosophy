    "main_text": "The Case Against Physicalism || Numbers and Abstracta\n5.3 Numbers and Abstracta\n\nA third problem, which we mentioned briefly above, is the problem\nof abstracta (Rabin 2020). This concerns the status within\nphysicalism of abstract objects, i.e., entities apparently not located\nin space and time, such as numbers, properties and relations, or\npropositions.\n\nTo see the problem, suppose that abstract objects, if they exist,\nexist necessarily, i.e., in all possible worlds. If physicalism is\ntrue, then the facts about such objects must either be physical facts,\nor else bear a particular relation (grounding, realisation) to the\nphysical. But on the face of it, that is not so. Can one really say\nthat 5+7=12, for example, is realised in, or holds in virtue of, some\narrangement of atoms and void? Or can one say that it itself is a\nphysical fact or a fundamental physical fact? If not, physicalism is\nfalse: the property of being such that 5+7=12 obtains the actual world\nbut is neither identical to, nor grounded in or realized by, any\nphysical property. (Sometimes the problem of abstracta is formulated\nas concerning, not abstract objects such as numbers or properties, but\nthe grounding or realization facts themselves; see, e.g, Dasgupta\n2015. We will set this aside here.)\n\nThere are a number of responses to this problem in the literature; for\nan overview, see Rabin 2020, see also Dasgupta 2015 and Bennett 2017;\nfor more general discussion of physicalism and abstracta, see Montero\n2017, Schneider 2017, and Witmer 2017.\n\nOne response points out that, while the problem of abstracta confronts\nmany different versions of physicalism, it does not arise for\nsupervenience physicalism. After all, since numbers exist in all\npossible worlds, facts about them trivially supervene on the physical;\nany world identical to the actual world in physical respects will be\nidentical to it in respect of whether 5+7=12, because any world at all\nis identical to the actual world in that respect! But the difficulty\nhere is that supervenience physicalism seems, as we saw above, too\nweak anyway. Indeed, one might think that the example of abstracta is\nsimply a different way to bring out that it is too weak.\n\nAnother option is to adopt a version of nominalism, and deny the\nexistence of abstracta entirely. The problem with this option is that\ndefending nominalism about mathematics is no easy matter, and in any\ncase nominalism and physicalism are normally thought of as distinct\ncommitments.\n\nA third view, which seems more attractive than either of the two\nmentioned so far, is to expand the notion of a physical property that\nis in play in formulations of physicalism. For example, one might\ntreat the properties of abstract objects as topic-neutral in\nsomething like the sense discussed in connection with Smart and\nreductionism above (see section 3.1). Topic-neutral properties have\nthe interesting feature that, while they themselves are not physical,\nbut are capable of being instantiated in what is intuitively a\ncompletely physical world, or indeed what is intuitively a completely\nspiritual world or a world entirely made of water. If so, it becomes\npossible to understand physicalism so that the reference to\n\u2018physical properties\u2019 within it is understood more\ncorrectly as \u2018physical or topic-neutral properties\u2019. \n\nA final response to the problem does not expand the notion of the\nphysical as much as it restricts the scope of physicalism to\nproperties of a certain sort. One suggestion along these lines has\nbeen made by a number of writers (e.g. Rabin 2020, following Dasgupta\n2015) in the context of grounding physicalism, though perhaps the\nunderlying idea can be extended to other varieties as well. They\nsuggest that grounding physicalism, which we formulated above as (7),\nshould be revised to take the following form:\n\n(7*)\n Physicalism is true at a possible world w iff every\ngroundable property instantiated at w is either a\nphysical property or is grounded in a physical property.\n\n\nHere, a property is groundable just in case it is apt for being\ngrounded, i.e. it is the sort of property that can be either grounded\nor not. Ordinary psychological properties are presumably in this\nclass. If grounding physicalism is true, they are grounded in physical\nproperties, whereas if it is false, they are not grounded in physical\nproperties; either way, they are groundable properties. But\nmathematical properties and the properties of abstracta more generally\nmight in at least some instances not be groundable, they may\nfail to be properties that are apt for being grounded. If so, we have\nan alternative solution to the problem of abstracta: (7*) permits that\nsome properties of abstracta are not grounded in the physical, so long\nas they are ungroundable. \n",
