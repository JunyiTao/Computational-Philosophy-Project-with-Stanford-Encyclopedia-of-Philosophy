    "main_text": "Metaphysics and philosophy of language || Presumption, \u201cap\u016brva,\u201d and the nature of the self\n4. Ideology and ethics\n\n\nThat Kum\u0101rila can so often enlist common-sense intuitions in\ndefense of his project, however, might be thought in tension with such\nsurely non-commonsensical ideas as that there is a mysterious\n\u201cap\u016brva\u201d connecting the eminently temporal\nacts of Vedic practitioners to the always \u201cyet-to-be\u201d\ndharma from which M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas take their\nbearings\u2014and in tension, as well, with\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101\u2019s foundational appeal to an\nessentially authorless corpus of Sanskrit texts. Indeed,\nKum\u0101rila\u2019s philosophically sophisticated efforts thus to\ndetach characteristically Vedic claims from any finite human\nperspective can be understood as rather insidious. It is not beside the\npoint to note in this regard that the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101\ntradition he advanced can be characterized (as by Sheldon Pollock) as\n\u201cthe dominant orthodox discourse of traditional India\u201d\n(1989, 604); for it is at least arguably the case that it is\nprecisely the appeal to the transcendent character of the Vedas that\nsecured M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101\u2019s dominance, and that\nthe securing of dominance was just the point of that\nappeal. That is surely as some of M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101\u2019s critics argued; proponents of the skeptical\n\u201cC\u0101rv\u0101ka\u201d school of thought, for example, argued that the various\naspects of the Vedic worldview were all introduced by Brahmins simply in\norder to secure their own livelihood as the adjudicators of that\ntradition. Whether or not that represents a reasonable account of the\naims of Kum\u0101rila and other M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas, it is\nsurely a defensible view at least that such ideological effects were\namong the upshots of M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka influence. Sheldon\nPollock has recurrently argued, in this vein, that the dominance\nachieved by proponents of the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka project is\nreflected in widespread Indic conceptions of authoritative discourse in\ngeneral\u2014conceptions such as Kum\u0101rila himself advanced with\nhis arguments concerning, e.g., the epistemic status of the vast corpus\nof Brahmanical literature (generally styled sm\u1e5bti,\n\u201ctradition\u201d) that extends beyond the Vedic corpus\n(contrastively styled \u015bruti,\n\u201crevelation\u201d).\n\n\nThus, Kum\u0101rila argued at length in the\nTantrav\u0101rttika (e.g., 1.3.1, ff.) that traditional\nliterature can be accepted as authoritative just insofar as it\nexhibits the property of \u201cbeing rooted in the Vedas\u201d\n(vedam\u016blatvam)\u2014even if that means, in some cases,\ninferring the reality of a no-longer-accessible Vedic text as the\nbasis for retaining manifestly important traditions that do not\nobviously stem from any extant Vedic text. Chief among the upshots of\nthis is that what Kum\u0101rila and other M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas\ntook to be the basis for the distinctive epistemic status of the\nVedas\u2014namely, their being transcendently\n\u201cimpersonal\u201d (apauru\u1e63eya)\u2014was\neffectively claimed, as well, for whole traditions of learning\nostensibly relatable to the Vedas. As Pollock has suggested,\n\u201cother sorts of Brahmanical intellectual practices seeking to\nlegitimate their truth-claims had perforce to conform to this special\nmodel of what counts as knowledge, and so to suppress the evidence of\ntheir own historical existence.\u201d (1989, 609; see, as well,\nHalbfass 1991, passim)\n\n\nThe characteristically M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43saka claim that the Vedas\nare eternal can thus be understood to inform a pan-Sanskritic episteme\nsuch as lends itself to the sort of analysis that is characteristic of\nPierre Bourdieu, according to whom \u201cevery established order tends\nto produce (to very different degrees and with very different means)\nthe naturalization of its own arbitrariness.\u201d (Bourdieu 1977,\n164) The enormous influence of philosophical projects such as\nKum\u0101rila\u2019s, that is, arguably had the effect of masking the\nspecifically located and interested character particularly of\nBrahmanical claims to authority, giving historical and contingent\nclaims the status that goes with their supposedly just reflecting\nthe way things are. It is not unreasonable, then, to see in\nthe success of Kum\u0101rila\u2019s project a paradigm case of the\nkind of historical situation in which, as Bourdieu puts it, \u201cthe\nestablished cosmological and political order is perceived not as\narbitrary, i.e. as one possible order among others, but as a\nself-evident and natural order which goes without saying and therefore\ngoes unquestioned.\u201d (ibid., 165\u20136) To that extent,\nKum\u0101rila\u2019s philosophy would seem readily to admit of the\nkind of ideology critique advanced, following Bourdieu, by Pollock.\n\n\nWhile that is not an unreasonable characterization of the context and\nimplications of his philosophy, Kum\u0101rila can also be read as\narguing for a radical de-centering of individual aims and\nprojects\u2014for the relativization of all claims and goals to an\nessentially linguistic reality that is above all distinguished by its\nvastly exceeding any particular\nperspective. M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas typically distinguished, in\nthis regard, between dimensions of Vedic practice that are essentially\n\u201cfor the sake of the person\u201d\n(puru\u1e63\u0101rtha), and those that are \u201cfor the\nsake of the sacrifice\u201d (kratvartha)\u2014and in the\nfinal analysis, it is the latter dimensions that are of ultimate\nsignificance for proponents of the Vedic worldview defended by\nKum\u0101rila. (This interpretation is advanced by Clooney 1990,\n163, ff.) While Kum\u0101rila\u2019s robust realism surely extended,\nthen, to the thought that the selves persons typically take\nthemselves to be are real\u2014that, e.g., the referential character\nof the first-person pronoun discloses something that is really the\ncase\u2014there is an important sense in which his project can be\ntaken finally to cut against the pursuit of any self-centered\nagenda. Emphasizing, to similar effect, some profound intuitions that\ncan be understood as reflected in the doctrine of the transcendence of\nthe Vedas, J. N. Mohanty has suggested that the salient point of this\nclaim is that \u201cthe intention of the author is not relevant for\nunderstanding the texts. The text itself is primary and\nautonomous.\u201d (2007, 65)\n\n\nExemplifying, that is, a long-standing tradition that has always\nalready preceded the individuals who find themselves constituted\nthereby, the Vedas, on the understanding of them commended by Mohanty,\n\u201cconstitute the founding texts for the Hindu world by opening up\nthe horizon \u2026 within which the tradition has understood itself\nand [within which] we who belong to that tradition have understood\nourselves.\u201d (ibid.) Mohanty, then, not implausibly finds\nit possible to see a basically Gadamerian thought reflected in the idea\nof the Vedas as authorless, and thus to emphasize the character of\nthese as representing a horizon for (rather than a constraint\non) ethical thinking:\u00a0 \u201cThe Hindu understanding of\ndharma as embodied in the imperatives laid down in the [Vedas]\npreserves the idea of ethics as rooted solidly in that tradition which\nwas founded by those texts, but which those texts have permitted us to\nreinterpret ever anew.\u201d (ibid.) While this is an\ninterestingly profound characterization of some of the insights driving\nKum\u0101rila\u2019s project, it is no less reasonable to emphasize,\nas well, that insofar as Kum\u0101rila\u2019s arguments helped secure\nfor M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas the status of privileged arbiters of\nthis ongoing \u201creinterpretation,\u201d questions of power and\nauthority remain ineliminable from an understanding of what he was up\nto.\n",
