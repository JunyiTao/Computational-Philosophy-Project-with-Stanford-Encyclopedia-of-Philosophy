    "main_text": "Rational choice theory\n5. Rational choice theory\n\nInsofar as economics explains and predicts phenomena as consequences\nof individual choices, which are themselves explained in terms of alleged\nreasons, it must depict agents as to some extent rational.\nRationality, like reasons, involves evaluation, and just as one can\nassess the rationality of individual choices, so one can assess the\nrationality of social choices and examine how they are and ought to be\nrelated to the preferences and judgments of individuals. In addition,\nthere are intricate questions concerning rationality in strategic\nsituations in which outcomes depend on the choices of multiple\nindividuals. Since rationality is a central concept in branches of\nphilosophy such as action theory, epistemology, ethics, and philosophy\nof mind, studies of rationality frequently cross the boundaries\nbetween economics and philosophy.\n",
