    "main_text": "Overview of Antiochus\u2019 Philosophy\n2. Overview of Antiochus\u2019 Philosophy\n\n\nAntiochus regarded the criterion of truth and the goal\n(telos, end) of human life as the two most important concerns\nof philosophy (Cicero, Acad. 2.29), and we are best informed\nabout his epistemological and ethical views. As we have seen, the\noccasion for his break from Philo was a disagreement about\nknowledge. After years of loyally defending the skepticism of Philo\nand his Academic predecessors, Antiochus came to embrace the opposing\ndogmatic position that knowledge is possible. What is more, he\nmaintained that the original or Old Academy of Plato and his immediate\nfollowers were of the same opinion. This put him in conflict with his\nmore immediate predecessors, some of whom had argued that Plato should\nalso be interpreted as a skeptic (Cicero, Acad. 1.46).  Thus,\naccording to Antiochus, it was not he who was departing from Academic\ntradition, but the institution from the time of Arcesilaus to Philo\nthat had betrayed the true Academic inheritance of the original Old\nAcademy, which he was now restoring.\n\n\nThere is a further complication. The epistemology that Antiochus\ndefended was Stoic in all essential points (Brittain 2012). This was\nobvious to his contemporaries, some of whom charged that, far from\nbeing an Academic of any kind, he was a Stoic and belonged in the Stoa\nrather than in the Academy (Acad. 2.69, 132, cf. 137;\nS.E. PH 1.235). In reply, Antiochus maintained that the Old\nAcademy, the Peripatos and the Stoa were in fundamental\nagreement. According to him, far from being an innovator, Zeno of\nCitium, the founder of Stoicism, was responsible mainly only for a new\nterminology and a handful of corrections to the Old Academic doctrine\n(Cicero,\nAcad. 1.35). Though unconvincing to many of his\ncontemporaries, this historical thesis explains how Antiochus could\ndefend Stoic epistemology against the arguments made by his Academic\npredecessors while claiming to revive the Old Academy. His arguments\nabout both epistemology and ethics were embedded in this\nreinterpretation of Academic history and thus were part of an argument\nabout who was the legitimate heir of the school\u2019s\ntradition.\n\n\nMatters were likely more complicated still, and the state of the\nevidence leaves much room for interpretative disagreement. Some\nscholars have argued that his engagement with Platonism was more\nthoroughgoing than ancient and modern interpreters who have emphasized\nhis debts to Stoicism tend to allow. The tantalizing fact that Zeno\nstudied with the Academic scholarch, Polemo, lends some plausibility\nto the idea that Stoicism was itself indebted to the Old Academy in\ncertain respects. And the case has been made that Antiochus exerted an\ninfluence on, or prefigured, developments in Middle Platonism (see\nBonazzi 2012).\n\nEpistemology and ethics belong respectively to Logic and Ethics which,\ntogether with Physics, were the three parts of philosophy recognized\nin the Hellenistic era (cf. Ac. 1, 19). We are better informed about\nAntiochus\u2019 epistemology and ethical theory than his Physics, which\naccurately reflects his own priorities, though, as we have seen, he\nwrote a book about the gods, a subject that belonged to Physics. For\nfirm evidence about Antiochean Physics we we are largely reliant on\nthe brief exposition of the views of the Old Academics and\nPeripatetics by the Antiochean spokesman, Varro, in Acad. 1\n(24\u201329), who also mentions a few \u201ccorrections\u201d by Zeno,\nwhich Antiochus may have adopted (1. 39). Here as elsewhere it is hard\nto tell whether and to what extent the resemblance between Antiochus\u2019\nview, according to which material reality is constituted by two things\nand their interaction, one active, one passive, and Stoic views\nreflects the influence of the latter on Antiochus or is evidence of an\nOld Academic influence on Stoicism (see Inwood 2012). \n",
