    "main_text": "Ethics, Language, and Methods || Reason and Reasons\n4.2 Reason and Reasons\n\nAn ethical problem is essentially constituted by disagreement or\nuncertainty in attitude, though it is often constituted by\ndisagreement or uncertainty in belief as well. Resolving an ethical\nproblem, therefore, requires coordinating attitudes, sometimes by\ncoordinating beliefs that causally affect those attitudes. Attitudes\nmay be coordinated by methods that do not involve the use of language;\nphysical force, bribery, and physical seduction are just a few\nnonlinguistic means of shaping and coordinating attitudes. Stevenson,\nhowever, is interested only in linguistic methods of\ncoordinating attitudes, which he categorizes as either\n\u201crational\u201d or \u201cnonrational.\u201d Rational methods\nseek to shape or coordinate attitudes by using language to produce\nreasons; Stevenson thus calls the set of such methods, aptly enough,\n\u201cReason.\u201d Nonrational methods seek to shape or coordinate\nattitudes by using language in other ways; Stevenson calls this set of\nmethods \u201cPersuasion.\u201d\n\nA reason, for Stevenson, is \u201cany statement about\nany matter of fact which any speaker considers\nlikely to alter attitudes\u201d (1944, 115). \u201cWhether this\nreason will in fact support or oppose the judgment will depend,\u201d\nStevenson says, \u201con whether the hearer believes it, and upon\nwhether if he does, it will actually make a difference to his\nattitudes; but it may conveniently be called a reason (though not\nnecessarily a \u2018valid\u2019 one) regardless of whether it is\naccepted or not\u201d (1944, 115). Thus, a reason is a statement\nwhose content, if believed, is causally relevant to altering\nattitudes. (This may seem like a very surprising account of what it is\nto be a reason for some attitude; see also\n Section 5.1,\n below.)\n\nStevenson provides a plethora of examples throughout his work to\nclarify the variety of ways in which beliefs, in their intermediary\nroles, may serve to strengthen or weaken attitudes (1944, especially\nChapters V, VI, VIII). For example, suppose that Smith disapproves of\npolicies that put a great burden on the poor and make little\ndifference to the rich. They say of a proposed policy that it is good.\nAssuming model (P1), Smith\u2019s claim is akin to the claim\n\u201cI approve of this policy; do so as well.\u201d Assuming model\n(P3a), their claim is akin to the claim \u201cThis policy\ndoes not put great burden on the poor while making little difference\nto the rich; hooray for this policy.\u201d Jones might then, in\nappealing to the claim that the policy puts great burden on the poor\nand makes little difference to the rich, alter Smith\u2019s attitude toward\nthe policy either by directly contradicting a belief of Smith\u2019s\n(assuming model (P3a)) or by leading Smith to accept that\nthey do not approve of the policy, which again contradicts their\nbelief (assuming model (P1)). Here the impact of Smith\u2019s\nnewly acquired belief on their earlier moral judgments is due to the\nlogical relation between the beliefs. Next consider a case\nwhere Smith hasn\u2019t really thought about the policy before. They might\nnevertheless be disposed, upon coming to believe that the policy puts\na great burden on the poor while making little difference to the rich,\nto disapprove of the policy. Here the newly acquired belief would not\ncontradict an earlier belief of Smith\u2019s, but it might nevertheless\nhave an impact, thanks to a suitable psychological relation,\non their beliefs and attitudes. Other sorts of examples, discussed by\nStevenson, of reasons for attitude revision without a logical relation\nto existing beliefs include appeals to authority, or to the genealogy\nof beliefs or attitudes (1944, 123\u2013125).\n\nThus, ethical inquiry and deliberation often proceeds rationally by\npresenting reasons to be for or against something,\nreasons whose effectiveness is tied to their logical or psychological\nrelation to others\u2019 beliefs (for criticism and further discussion of\nStevenson\u2019s account reasons, see, again, also\n Section 5.1).\n",
