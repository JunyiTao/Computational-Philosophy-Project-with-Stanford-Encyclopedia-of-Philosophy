    "main_text": "Absolute Nothingness: Giving Philosophical Form to the Formless || Western Being vs. Eastern Nothingness? Ontology vs. Meontology?\n3.1 Western Being vs. Eastern Nothingness? Ontology vs. Meontology?\n\nNishitani wrote the following with regard to Nishida and Tanabe:\n\u201c[Their] philosophies share a distinctive and common basis that\nsets them apart from traditional Western philosophy: absolute\nnothingness. \u2026 Clearly the idea of absolute nothingness came to\nawareness in the spirituality of the East; but the fact that it has\nalso been posited as a foundation for philosophical thought represents\na new step virtually without counterpart in the history of Western\nphilosophy\u201d (NKC IX, 225\u201326; Nishitani 1991, 161).\n\n\u201cFirst philosophy\u201d in the Western tradition is ontology,\nwhich asks the question of \u201cbeing qua being,\u201d and tends to\nanswer this question either in terms of the most universal\n\u201cbeing-ness\u201d or in terms of the \u201chighest\nbeing.\u201d For Aristotle, the primary category of being is\n\u201csubstance,\u201d ambiguously thought in its primary sense as\nthe particular entity (e.g. Socrates) and in its secondary sense the\nuniversal that makes that entity what it is (e.g. human being), and\nthe highest being was thought to be the \u201cunmoved mover.\u201d\nGreek ontology later influenced the Christian theological tradition to\nthink of God as the \u201chighest being,\u201d such that the dual\nthreads of the Western tradition were woven together as what Heidegger\ncalls \u201conto-theology.\u201d Hence, the fundamental\nphilosophical question of the onto-theological mainstream of the West\nis, \u201cWhat is being?\u201d On the other hand, the\ncounter-question which the Kyoto School finds in the East is,\n\u201cWhat is nothingness?\u201d In place of an ontology, first\nphilosophy in the East is more often a \u201cmeontology\u201d: a\nphilosophy of non-being or nothingness.\n\nPerhaps we should say \u201cmu-logy\u201d rather than\n\u201cmeontology\u201d; for, strictly speaking, the Greek\nmeon, \u201cnon-being,\u201d should be translated into\nJapanese as hi-u. What I am translating as\n\u201cnothingnesss,\u201d mu, is written with a single\ncharacter rather than as a negation (hi) of being\n(u). This is crucial since the nothingness with which they\nare concerned is not the simple negation or privation of being. It is\ncloser to what Heidegger means by \u201cbeing.\u201d Attentive to\nwhat he calls the \u201contological difference\u201d between being\n(das Sein) and beings (das Seiende), Heidegger notes\nthat with respect to beings, understood as determinate things, being\ncan only appear as \u201cno-thing.\u201d We fail to attend to the\nno-thing of being when we think only of things, and especially when we\nthink of thinking as a mere calculation of predetermined beings.\nHeidegger thus calls \u201cthe nothing\u201d (das Nichts)\nthe \u201cveil of being.\u201d Being cannot but appear to us as\nnothing, insofar as we know only of beings. Yet it is das\nSein or das Nichts which grants an open place, a\nclearing (Lichtung), for beings to show themselves in the\nfirst place. But this clearing lets beings be by withdrawing itself\nfrom view. Just as \u201cnature (phusis) loves to\nhide\u201d (Heraclitus), being lets determinate beings come to\npresence by withdrawing its indeterminate abundance into absence or\nself-concealment (see Heidegger 1975, Vol. 9, 103\u201322; and Vol.\n65, 246\u201347).\n\nTanabe studied with Heidegger in the early 1920s. (In fact, upon\nreturning to Japan in 1924, Tanabe was the first scholar in the world\nto write an article on Heidegger\u2019s thought.) When he later wrote\nthe following, Tanabe no doubt had Heidegger\u2019s 1929 \u201cWhat\nis Metaphysics?\u201d lecture in mind: \u201cAll science needs to\ntake some entity or other as its object of study. The point of contact\nis always in being, not in nothing. The discipline that has to do with\nnothingness is philosophy\u201d (THZ VI, 156; see Heisig 2001,\n121).\n\nHeidegger was of course not the first Western philosopher to ask after\nthat which is radically other than beings or \u201cbeyond\nbeing\u201d as\n such.[5]\n For example, Tanabe could have also found support for the idea that\nphilosophy investigates nothingness in the following passage from\nHegel: \u201cDas Erste der Philosophie aber ist, das\nabsolute Nichts zu erdenken\u201d [Yet the first task of\nphilosophy is to conceive of absolute nothingness] (quoted\nfrom Hegel\u2019s \u201cGlauben und Wissen\u201d in \u014chashi\n1984, 203). The Kyoto School might even be thought of as recovering a\nsuggestion from one of the first Presocratic philosophers,\nAnaximander: namely, to think finite beings as determinations, or\ndelimitations, of \u201cthe indefinite\u201d or \u201cthe\nunlimited\u201d (to apeiron).\n\nMoreover, as Kyoto School thinkers frequently do point out, Christian\nnegative theologians and mystics, most notably Meister Eckhart, at\ntimes make use of the notion of \u201cthe nothing\u201d to refer to\nthat which transcends all concepts and all oppositions. For Eckhart,\n\u201cnothing\u201d (niht) was one way of indicating the\n\u201cGodhead\u201d (g\u014dtheit) beyond \u201cGod\u201d\ndelimited as a personal being (see Eckehart 1963, 328). Niht\nhere is an expression, at the limits of language, which attempts to\nindicate \u201cthe nothingness of indistinct fullness from which flow\n\u2026 all oppositions and relations\u201d (Sch\u00fcrmann 1978,\n168). Eckhart speaks of a breakthrough, not only beyond the ego, but\nalso beyond God Himself, a breakthrough, that is, to an abyssal\nGodhead understood as \u201cthe silent desert into which no\ndistinction ever gazed, of Father, Son, or Holy Ghost\u201d (Eckehart\n1963, 316). Analogously, Nishida writes that \u201cwhen we truly\nenter thoroughly into the consciousness of absolute nothingness, there\nis neither I nor God\u201d (NKZ V, 182; see Nishida 1958, 137).\n\nNishitani affirms Eckhart\u2019s intimations of a Godhead of absolute\nnothingness, even though he notes that this is \u201cmarkedly distant\nfrom orthodox Christian faith,\u201d which limits the concept of\nnothingness to the relative nothingness expressed in the\nnihilum of creatio ex nihilo, that is, to the\nabsolute privation of being out of which the highest being creates\nlesser beings (NKC X, 75; Nishitani 1982, 66; also see NKC VII). Yet\nNishitani\u2019s student and Eckhart scholar Ueda Shizuteru, despite\nprofound appreciation for Eckhart\u2019s thought and its nearness to\nZen, argues in the end that Eckhart\u2019s nothingness, like that of\nnegative theology in general, still points to an inexpressibly higher\nbeing (see USS VIII, 146). Critically adapting\nHeidegger\u2019s expression, we might say that the nothing is still\nunderstood as \u201cthe veil\u201d of this inexpressibly higher\nbeing. Both Nishitani and Ueda ultimately look to Zen for a\nnothingness so absolute that, in thoroughly negating any traces of\nopposition to beings (i.e., as a higher being transcending worldly\nbeings), it is paradoxically found fully in the concrete facts and\nactivities of the here and now (see USS VIII, 5ff.).\n\n\u014chashi stresses, however, that neither the Buddhist tradition nor\nthe Kyoto School should be thought of as having a patent on the\nradical \u201cthinking of nothingness.\u201d In fact, he argues,\n\u201cthis thought slowly came to the fore within Western philosophy\nitself,\u201d a process that indeed set the stage for Kyoto School\ncontributions to contemporary philosophy (\u014chashi 2004,\n12\u201313). Nishitani had already explored a number of resonant\nnotions of nothingness, not only in the Neoplatonic and Christian\nmystical traditions, but also in 19th and 20th\ncentury Western philosophers such as Nietzsche and Heidegger (see NKC\nVIII; Nishitani 1990). And yet, here again Nishitani finds residues of\nan ontological bias, where a kind of \u201crelative\nnothingness\u201d is posited as either a simple negation of or as a\nveil for being. Nishitani ultimately concludes that Nietzsche\nsucceeded only in expressing a \u201cstandpoint of relative absolute\nnothingness\u201d; and even in Heidegger, he critically suggests,\n\u201ctraces of the representation of nothingness as some\n\u2018thing\u2019 that is nothingness still remain\u201d (NKC X, 75\nand 108; Nishitani 1982, 66 and\n 96).[6]\n\nIn any case, it is fair to say that the Kyoto School thinkers\ngenerally consider the purest sources for the idea of absolute\nnothingness to lie in the traditions of Asia. Hisamatsu went so far as\nto speak of absolute nothingness as \u201coriental nothingness\u201d\n(Hisamatsu 1960); though it is important to bear in mind that his\nclaim is that this idea was first clearly discovered in the\ntraditions of Asia. Absolute nothingness is by no means only relevant\nto Asian cultures, anymore than in 1500 CE the earth was only round in\nthe West. Moreover, if the idea of absolute nothingness\n\u201ccame to awareness in the spirituality of the East,\u201d as\nNishitani says, the philosophy of absolute nothingness is\ngenerally considered to be the Kyoto School\u2019s own contribution\nto the contemporary world of thought opened up by the meeting of\nEastern and Western traditions.\n\nNishida\u2014who could hardly be accused of underestimating what\nJapan had to learn from Western philosophy\u2014also spoke at times\nin very general terms of Eastern nothingness in contrast with Western\nbeing. In his essay, \u201cThe Types of Culture of the Classical\nPeriods of East and West Seen from a Metaphysical Perspective,\u201d\nhe wrote: \u201cHow then are we to distinguish between the types of\nculture of the West and East from a metaphysical point of view? I\nthink we can do this by dividing them into that [i.e., the culture of\nthe West] which considers the ground of reality to be being, and that\n[i.e., the culture of the East] which considers this ground to be\nnothingness.\u201d In Greek philosophy, he goes on to say,\n\u201cthat which has form and determination was regarded as the\nreal\u201d; or even, as in Plato, reality, that which has true being,\nwas understood as the Forms. Judeo-Christian culture, however\nradically different in various ways it was from Greek culture, and\ndespite negative theology\u2019s indications of a Deus\nabsconditus as a kind of nothingness, nevertheless primarily\nconsidered the person of God as \u201cthe most perfect\nbeing\u201d to be the basis of reality. In radical contrast to both\nthe Greek and Judeo-Christian origins of Western culture, Indian\nculture, like that of China and Japan, took \u201cthe profoundest\nidea of nothingness as its basis\u201d (NKZ VII, 429\u201333; see\nNishida 1970, 237\u201340).\n\nIn the closing lines of the preface to his 1926 book, From That\nWhich Acts to That Which Sees, a book many scholars view as the\nbeginning of \u201cNishida Philosophy\u201d proper, we find the\nfollowing famous and programmatic lines: \u201cIt goes without saying\nthat there is much to admire, and much to learn from, in the\nimpressive achievements of Western culture, which thought form as\nbeing and the giving of form as good. However, does there not lie\nhidden at the base of our Eastern culture, preserved and passed down\nby our ancestors for several thousand years, something which sees the\nform of the formless and hears the voice of the voiceless? Our hearts\nand minds endlessly seek this something; and it is my wish to provide\nthis quest with a philosophical foundation\u201d (NKZ IV, 6).\n",
