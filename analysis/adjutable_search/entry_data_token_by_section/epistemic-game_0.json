    "main_text": "The Epistemic View of Games || Classical Game Theory\n1.1 Classical Game Theory\nA game refers to any interactive situation involving a\ngroup of self-interested agents, or players. The defining\nfeature of a game is that the players are engaged in an\n\u201cinterdependent decision problem\u201d (Schelling\n1960). Classically, the mathematical description of a game\nincludes following components:\n\nThe players. In this entry, we only consider games with a\nfinite set of players. We use \\(\\Agt\\) to denote the set of players in a\ngame, and \\(i, j,\\ldots\\) to denote its elements.\nThe feasible options (typically called actions\nor strategies) for each player. Again, we only consider games\nwith finitely many feasible options for each player.\nThe players\u2019 preferences over possible outcome. Here\nwe represent them as von Neumann-Morgenstern utility functions \\(u_i\\)\nassigning real-valued utilities to each outcome of the game.\n\nA game can have many other structural properties. It can\nbe represented as a single-shot or multi-stage decision problem, or it\ncan include simultaneous or stochastic moves. We start with games\nin strategic form without stochastic moves, and will\nintroduce more sophisticated games as we go along in the entry. In a\nstrategic game, each player \\(i\\) can choose from a (finite) set \\(S_i\\)\nof options, also called actions or strategies. The combination of all\nthe players\u2019 choices, denoted \\({\\mathbf{s}}\\), is called\na strategy profile, or outcome of the game. We write\n\\({\\mathbf{s}}_i\\) for \\(i\\)\u2019s component in \\({\\mathbf{s}}\\), and\n\\({\\mathbf{s}}_{-i}\\) for the profile of strategies for all agents other\nthan \\(i\\). Finally, we write \\(\\Pi_{i \\in \\Agt} S_i\\) for the set of all\nstrategy profiles of a given game. Putting everything together, a\nstrategic game is a tuple \\(\\langle \\A, \\{S_i, u_i\\}_{i\\in\\A}\\rangle\\)\nwhere \\(\\A\\) is a finite set of players, for each \\(i\\in\\A\\), \\(S_i\\) is a\nfinite set of actions and \\(u_i:\\Pi_{i\\in\\A} S_i\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}\\)\nis player \\(i\\)\u2019s utility function.\nThe game in Figure 1 is an example\nof a game in strategic form. There are two players, Ann and Bob, and\neach has to choose between two options: \\(\\Agt = \\{Ann, Bob\\}\\),\n\\(S_{Ann} = \\{u, d\\}\\) and \\(S_{Bob} = \\{l, r\\}\\). The value of \\(u_{Ann}\\)\nand \\(u_{Bob}\\), representing their respective preferences over the\npossible outcomes of the game, are displayed in the cell of the\nmatrix. If Bob chooses \\(l\\), for instance, Ann prefers the outcome she\nwould get by choosing \\(u\\) to the one she would get by choosing \\(d\\),\nbut this preference is reversed in the case Bob chooses \\(r\\). This game\nis called a \u201cpure coordination game\u201d in the literature\nbecause the players have a clear interest in coordinating their\nchoices\u2014i.e., on \\((u, l)\\) or \\((d, r)\\)\u2014but they are\nindifferent about which way they coordinate their choices.\n\n\n \u00a0 Bob \nAnn \n\n\\(l\\) \\(r\\)\n\\(u\\) 1,1  0,0 \n\\(d\\) 0,0  1,1 \n\n\n\nFigure 1: A coordination game\n\nIn a game, no single player has total control over which outcome\nwill be realized at the end of the interaction. This depends on the\ndecisions of all players. Such abstract models\nof interdependent decisions are capable of representing a\nwhole array of social situations, from strictly competitive to\ncooperative ones. See Ross (2010) for more details about classical\ngame theory and key references.\nThe central analytic tool of classical game theory are solution\nconcepts. They provide a top-down perspective specifying which\noutcomes of a game are deemed \u201crational\u201d. This can be\ngiven both a prescriptive or a predictive\nreading. Nash equilibrium is one of the most well-known solution\nconcepts, but we will encounter others below. In the game above, for\ninstance, there are two Nash equilibria in so-called \u201cpure\nstrategies.\u201d[1]\n These are the two coordination profiles: \\((u,\nl)\\) and \\((d, r)\\).\nFrom a prescriptive point of view, a solution concept is a set of\npractical recommendations\u2014i.e., recommendations about what the\nplayers should do in a game. From a predictive point of view, solution\nconcepts describe what the players will actually do in certain\ninteractive situation. Consider again the pure strategy Nash\nequilibria in the above example. Under a prescriptive interpretation,\nit singles out what players should do in the game. That is,\nAnn and Bob should either play their component of \\((u, l)\\) or \\((d,\nr)\\). Under the predictive interpretation, these profiles are the ones\nthat one would expect to observe in a actual play of that game.\nThis solution-concept-driven perspective on games faces many\nfoundational difficulties, which we do not survey here. The interested\nreader can consult Ross (2010), Bruin (2010), and Kadane & Larkey\n(1983) for a discussion.\n",
