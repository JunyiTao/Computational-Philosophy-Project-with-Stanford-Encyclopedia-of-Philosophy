This was an extraordinary period for\nhis work. During the two years he would spend in Rome he wrote diverse\ntexts about his Art. However, the two most important works in\nthis period were Desconhort, a poem in which he reflected on\nhis life, his plans, his failures, and his hopes; and Arbor\nScientiae, an encyclopedia in which he classified knowledge,\nwhich would be very appreciated during the Renaissance.\n\nAfter his stay in Rome, Llull went to Paris, where he would live from\nAugust 1298 until July 1299. He wrote 17 texts addressed to the\nscholars in the arts and theologians, which showed his involvement in\nthe academic and political discussions of the University. After this\nprolific period, he returns to Majorca but new events will make travel\nhim again.\n\nThe invasion of Syria by the Mongolian armies lead by Ghazan Khan in\n1299 and his subsequent advance on the Holy Land raised new hopes\namong the Crusaders. Filled with enthusiasm by this news, Llull\ndecided to travel to Cyprus during the summer of 1301. On his arrival\nhe found out that, a year before, the Mongols had retired once again.\nHis disappointment would not stop him, and he convinced the King of\nCyprus to help him convert the Muslim, Nestorian, and Jacobite\npopulation of the island. His sermons met with little success, and in\n1302 he traveled to Port Ayas, in Armenia, where he made another\nattempt to preach to the infidels.\n\nRamon Llull went back to Genoa in May 1303. He would spend the\nfollowing years between Genoa and Montpellier, and he would write more\nthan 18 texts, the majority of which would be directed towards the\napplication of his Art to various disciplines and topics.\n\nAfter this relatively quiet period, Llull set out on a new trip to\nAfrica. This time he went to Libya, on his way to B\u00e9ja\u00efa.\nDe vita narrates this trip in detail. Llull spent most of the\ntime in prison. Instead of seeking to meet intellectuals, as he did on\nhis first trip to Tunisia, right after disembarkation, he went to the\nmain square and harangued passersby and anyone present at the time.\nThe crowd was infuriated, and Llull was placed under arrest. The\nauthorities questioned and imprisoned him. He would stay there for six\nmonths, receiving visits from sages who sought to convert him to\nIslam. He was later expelled from the city, but his hardships would\nnot end there. His ship sank on the trip back to Genoa, but Llull and\nanother passenger managed to survive by reaching the coast. He would\nthen remain in Pisa, where he would finish texts he had previously\nbegan writing, such as Ars generalis ultima.\n",
