    "main_text": "The logic of definitions || Two criteria\n2.1 Two criteria\n\nIt is a plausible requirement on any answer to these questions that\ntwo criteria be\n respected.[4]\n First, a stipulative definition should not enable us to establish\nessentially new claims\u2014call this the Conservativeness\ncriterion. We should not be able to establish, by means of a mere\nstipulation, new things about, for example, the moon. It is true that\nunless this criterion is made precise, it is subject to trivial\ncounterexamples, for the introduction of a definition materially\naffects some facts. Nonetheless, the criterion can be made precise and\ndefensible, and we shall soon see some ways of doing this.\n\nSecond, the definition should fix the use of the defined expression\n\\(X\\)\u2014call this the Use criterion. This criterion is\nplausible, since only the definition\u2014and nothing else\u2014is\navailable to guide us in the use of \\(X\\). There are complications\nhere, however. What counts as a use of \\(X\\)? Are occurrences within\nthe scope of \u2018say\u2019 and \u2018know\u2019 included? What\nabout the occurrence of \\(X\\) within quotation contexts, and those\nwithin words, for instance, \u2018Xenophanes\u2019? The\nlast question should receive, it is clear, the answer,\n\u201cNo.\u201d But the answers to the previous questions are not so\nclear. There is another complication: even if we can somehow separate\nout genuine occurrences of \\(X\\), it may be that some of these\noccurrences are rightfully ignored by the definition. For example, a\ndefinition of quotient may leave some occurrences of the term\nundefined (e.g., where there is division by 0). The orthodox view is\nto rule such definitions as illegitimate, but the orthodoxy deserves\nto be challenged here. Let us leave the challenge to another occasion,\nhowever, and proceed to bypass the complications through idealization.\nLet us confine ourselves to ground languages that possess a clearly\ndetermined logical structure (e.g., a first-order language) and that\ncontain no occurrences of the defined term \\(X\\). And let us confine\nourselves to definitions that place no restrictions on legitimate\noccurrences of \\(X\\). The Use criterion now dictates then that the\ndefinition should fix the use of all expressions in the expanded\nlanguage in which \\(X\\) occurs.\n\nA variant formulation of the Use criterion is this: the definition\nmust fix the meaning of the definiendum. The new formulation is less\ndeterminate and more contentious, for it relies on\n\u201cmeaning,\u201d an ambiguous and theoretically contentious\nnotion.\n\nNote that the two criteria govern all stipulative definitions,\nirrespective of whether they are single or multiple, or of whether\nthey are of form (2) or not.\n",
