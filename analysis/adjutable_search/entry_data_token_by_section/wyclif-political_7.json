    "main_text": "Types of Human Dominium || Evangelical Dominium\n4.1 Evangelical Dominium\n\n\nChrist restores the possibility of gaining our lost natural\ndominium both through His apostolic poverty and His\nredemptive sacrifice as described in Holy Scripture. Because of\nChrist's sinless nature, He was the first man since Adam capable of\nexhibiting the purity of natural dominium. This Christ shared\nwith His disciples, who were able to renounce all exclusive claims to\ncreated goods in a recreation of the communal caritas lost in\nthe Fall (De Civili Dominio III, 4, p. 51.17\u201324). This\npoverty is not simply the state of not owning things; one can live\nsinfully as easily in squalor as one can in luxury. The apostolic\npoverty of the early Church is a spiritual state, not an economic\nrejection of civil dominium. The similarity between Wyclif's\nconception of spiritual poverty as the ideal state for Christians and\nthe Franciscan ideal is noteworthy. Wyclif seems to make a case\nsimilar to the Spiritual Franciscans: Christ's life was exemplary for\nall Christians and Christ lived in apostolic poverty; therefore, all\nChristians ought follow His example, or at the least have that option\nopen to them. Wyclif's consonance with the Franciscan tradition is\nalso suggested in his use of\n Bonaventure's\n definition of apostolic poverty in the third book of De Civili\nDominio, but Wyclif's motives are distinctly different from the\nFriars' (De Civili Dominio III, 8, pp. 119\u2013120). While the\nFranciscans argued that their rule allowed them to regain the\nownership-free purity enjoyed by the early Apostolic church, Wyclif\ncontended that Christ's redemptive sacrifice enabled all Christians to\nregain natural dominium itself, not just its purity. This\nsuggested that the Franciscan life was a pale imitation of true\nChristianity, which Wyclif's Franciscan colleagues were quick to point\nout. One of the first critics of Wyclif's dominium thought\nwas William Woodford, O.F.M., who argued that Wyclif had gone too far\nin equating apostolic, spiritual poverty with prelapsarian purity. The\nextensive third book of De Civili Dominio is Wyclif's\nresponse to Franciscan critics like Woodford, and in which lie the\nseeds of the antifraternalism that would characterize his later\nwritings.  \n\n\nWyclif describes apostolic poverty as a mode of having with love,\ncomprehensible in terms of the individual's use of a thing for the\ngreatest spiritual benefit. God alone can bring about the love\ninstantiating divine dominium, making grace necessary for\napostolic poverty. Because the church is founded not on the\nmaterially-based laws of man, but on the spiritually-grounded lex\nChristi, it must be absolutely free of property ownership, the\nbetter to realize the spiritual purity required by apostolic\npoverty. Any material riches that the church comes upon as \u201cgoods of\nfortune\u201d must be distributed as alms for the poor, following the\npractice of Christ and the disciples, and the apostolic church. This\nis the ideal to which the Church must aspire through the example of\nChrist, and some of the harshest invective in Wyclif's prose is\ndirected against the Church's refusal to return to this apostolic\nstate. The turning point in Church history was the Donation of\nConstantine, on the basis of which the Church claimed to have the\ncivil dominium of a Caesar. Wyclif was vigorous in his\ncondemnation of the Donation, and would likely have been pleased had\nhe lived into the early fifteenth century, when\n Nicholas of Cusa\n argued persuasively that the document was a ninth-century forgery.\n\n",
