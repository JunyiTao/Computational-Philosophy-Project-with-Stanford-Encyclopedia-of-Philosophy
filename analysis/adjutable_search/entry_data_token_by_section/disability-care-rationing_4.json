    "main_text": "Why does disability pose a problem for health care rationing? || Disability and individual, head-to-head allocation\n2.2 Disability and individual, head-to-head allocation\n\nTaking all this together the result is, from the perspective of CEA\nreasoning, that disability seems to be a salient consideration for\nresource allocation. For the rest of this section, we will review what\nhas been said about how disability impacts the ethics of health care\nallocation, and in particular how the five problems mentioned above\nplay out in the case of disability.\n\nThere are two perspectives in which these intuitions can be tested: at\nthe level of individual, head-to-head allocation contests and at the\nlevel of social policies or strategies about health care allocation\nacross the population. In the first case we presume a head-to-head\ncomparison between a person with and another without a disability,\nboth of whom require the medical treatment or resource that, for\nwhatever reason, can only be available to one of them. We will have\noccasion below to question the philosophical value of head-to-head\nallocation scenarios, but there is no doubt they have emotional power\nand put the impact of disability into stark relief. Interestingly,\nalthough the impact of disability on rationing was initially raised\nlegally in terms of rationing policy (the Oregon rationing experiment\nmentioned above), despite creative legal academic discussions (Garvey\n1992; Peters 1995; Orentlicher 1996; and Crossley 2000), United States\ncourts were reluctant to move from the individual case to the policy\nlevel in the rationing debate because they were impressed by the\nargument that prioritization of health resources was simply\nunavoidable and so not discriminatory as a general policy. We return\nto this point below in the context of human rights and the impact of\ndisability.\n",
