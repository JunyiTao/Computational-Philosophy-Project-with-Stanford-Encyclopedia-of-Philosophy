The Discussion of Future Contingency and Its Background in Ancient and Medieval Logic\n\nFuture contingents appear to hold a strange quality when compared with\npresent or past tense statements, such as \u201cit is raining\u201d\nor \u201cNapoleon lost at Waterloo\u201d, whose truth-value does not\ndepend on future states or events. For it seems straightforward to\nclaim that the latter two sentences are true if and only if the states\nor events in question correspond with reality. But can it make sense\nto claim that the truth or falsity of a contingent future statement,\nsuch as \u201cThe first human being to set foot on Mars will be a\nwoman\u201d, depends on the future reality in a similar manner?\nClearly, this can only make sense if we can meaningfully refer to the\nfuture reality in the same way as we can refer to the past reality.\nHowever, if the future is open such a reference may be rather\nproblematic.\n\nThe philosophical and logical challenge to which the future\ncontingency discussion gives rise is two-fold. First of all, anyone\nwho wants to maintain some kind of indeterminism regarding the future,\nmay be confronted with some standard arguments in favor of logical\ndeterminism, i.e., arguments designed to demonstrate that there are no\nfuture contingents at all. In addition, anyone who holds that there\nare future contingents can be challenged to establish a reasonable\ntruth-theory compatible with the idea of an open future. Such a theory\nshould provide answers to questions like: Can one meaningfully regard\nfuture contingents as true or false now, if the future is open? And if\nso, how? Can assertions about the contingent future make any sense at\nall? And if so, how? Some logicians have held that no future\ncontingent is true. However, other logicians have found that this is\nunacceptable. Instead, they have looked for a theoretical basis on\nwhich we might hold that a future contingent is true (or false).\n\nAlready Aristotle (384\u2013322 B.C.E.) was aware of the problem of\nfuture contingents. Chapter IX of his work, On\nInterpretation, is without doubt the philosophical text which has\nhad the greatest impact on the debate about the relations between\ntime, truth, and possibility. The discussion in this text certainly\nbears witness to the fact that Ancient philosophy was highly conscious\nof tense-logical problems. Central to the discussion in this famous\nAristotelian text is the question of how to interpret the following\ntwo statements:\n\n\u201cTomorrow there will be a sea-battle\u201d\n\n\u201cTomorrow there will not be a sea-battle\u201d \n\nAristotle considered questions like: Should we say that one of these\nstatements is true today and the other false? How can we make a clear\ndistinction between what is going to happen tomorrow and what must\nhappen tomorrow? (See On Interpretation, 18 b 23 ff.).\n\nThe interpretative problems regarding Aristotle\u2019s logical\nproblem about the sea-battle tomorrow are by no means simple. Over the\ncenturies, many philosophers and logicians have formulated their\ninterpretations of the Aristotelian text (see \u00d8hrstr\u00f8m\nand Hasle 1995, p. 10 ff.). In the following we shall present an\ninterpretation of the text from the scholastic period and a modern\ninterpretation based on a three-valued semantics.\n\nIn the generation after Aristotle, Diodorus Cronus (ca. 340\u2013280\nB.C.E.) analysed similar problems using his so-called Master Argument.\nThis argument was a trilemma. According to Epictetus, Diodorus argued\nthat the following three propositions cannot all be true:\n\n(D1)\nEvery proposition true about the past is necessary.\n(D2)\nAn impossible proposition cannot follow from a possible\n one.[2]\n(D3)\nThere is a proposition which is possible, but which neither is nor\nwill be true.\n\n\nDiodorus used this incompatibility combined with the plausibility of\n(D1) and (D2) to argue that (D3) is false. Assuming (D1) and (D2) he\nwent on to define the possible as \u201cthat which either is or will\nbe true\u201d and the necessary as \u201cthat which, being true,\nwill not be false\u201d. In this way his argument seems to have been\ndesigned to demonstrate that there cannot be any future contingency at\nall. However, little is known about the way in which Diodorus used his\npremises in order to reach the conclusion. The reconstruction of the\nMaster Argument certainly constitutes a genuine problem within the\nhistory of logic. Various philosophers and logicians have tried to\nreconstruct the argument as it might have been. It is very likely that\nthe main structure of the argument was close to the argument presented\nin the next section. (See (\u00d8hrstr\u00f8m and Hasle 1995, p.\n15 ff.) and (Gaskin 1995) for references to the literature on the\nMaster Argument.)\n\nThe discussion took on a particularly interesting form in the Middle\nAges. During the Middle Ages logicians related their discipline to\ntheology. One of the most important theological questions was the\nproblem of the contingent future in relation to Christian doctrine.\nAccording to Christian tradition, divine foreknowledge comprises\nknowledge of the future choices to be made by men and women. But this\nassumption apparently gives rise to a straightforward argument from\ndivine foreknowledge to the necessity of the future: if God already\nnow knows which decision I will make tomorrow, then a\nnow-unpreventable truth about my choice tomorrow is already given. My\nchoice, then, appears to be necessary, not free. Hence, there seems to\nbe no basis for the claim that I have a free choice between genuine\nalternatives. This conclusion, however, violates the idea of human\nfreedom and moral accountability presupposed in much theology (though\nnot all).\n\nThe medieval discussion regarding the logic of divine foreknowledge\nis, from a formal point of view, very close to the classical\ndiscussion concerning future contingency. If we add the assumption\nthat necessarily, something is true if and only if it is known to God,\nthen it is easy to see how the discussion regarding the logic of\ndivine foreknowledge is, from a formal point of view, essentially the\nsame discussion as the classical discussion concerning future\ncontingency. This was clearly realised by the medieval logicians.\n\nIn his treatise De eventu futurorum, Lavenham (c. 1380) gave\na succinct overview over the basic approaches to the problem within\nscholasticism (see \u00d8hrstr\u00f8m 1983, Tuggy 1999). Lavenham\nconsidered a central argument leading from God\u2019s foreknowledge\nto the necessity of the future and the lack of proper human freedom.\nIn fact, the various positions on future contingency may be presented\nas possible reactions to this argument. The main structure of this\nargument is very close to what is believed to have been the Master\nArgument of Diodorus Cronus (see Gaskin 1995). It is clear from\nLavenham\u2019s text that he had some knowledge of this old Stoic or\nMegaric argument, probably through his reading of Cicero\u2019s\nDe Fato. The main idea is to transfer the assumed necessity\nof the past to the future. In order to make things clearer one might\nstate the argument in terms of yesterday and tomorrow, instead of past\nand future in general (as Lavenham tends to do). A non-theological\nversion of the argument can be presented in the following way. In this\nsequence E is some event, which may or may not take place tomorrow\n(e.g. a sea-battle). Non-E is just a state of affairs without E\noccurring. E and non-E are supposed to be mutually exclusive.\n\nEither E is going to take place tomorrow or non-E is going to take\nplace tomorrow. (Assumption).\nIf a proposition about the past is true, then it is now necessary,\ni.e., inescapable or unpreventable. (Assumption).\nIf E is going to take place tomorrow, then it is true that\nyesterday it was the case that E would take place in two days.\n(Assumption).\nIf E is going to take place tomorrow, then it is now necessary\nthat yesterday E would take place in two days. (Follows from 2. and\n3.).\nIf it is now necessary that yesterday E would take place in two\ndays, then it is now necessary that E is going to take place tomorrow.\n(Assumption).\nIf E is going to take place tomorrow, then E is necessarily going\nto take place tomorrow. (Follows from 4. and 5.).\nIf non-E is going to take place tomorrow, then non-E is\nnecessarily going to take place tomorrow. (Follows by the same kind of\nreasoning as 6.).\nEither E is necessarily going to take place tomorrow or non-E is\nnecessarily going to take place tomorrow. (Follows from 1., 6. and\n7.).\nTherefore, what is going to happen tomorrow is going to happen\nwith necessity. (Follows from 8.).\n\n\nLavenham accepted the validity of this argument, and he pointed out\nthat one should consider four possible reactions to it. He presented\nthis classification in a theological context, but it can be translated\ninto non-theological language. Assuming that necessarily, something is\ntrue if and only if it is known to God, the four possible reactions in\nLavenham\u2019s analysis can be listed in the following way:\n\nAccept the above argument (including its premises). Grant that\nthere are no future contingents, i.e., statements about the future are\neither impossible or necessary.\nDeny that if a certain event is going to occur, then it is true\nthat it has always been the case that it would occur.\nDeny the following: For any possible event, which might occur at a\ncertain time in the future, either it will be that the event takes\nplace at that future time, or it will be that the event does not take\nplace at that time.\nDeny that the past in general is necessary.\n\n\nClearly, if we don\u2019t want to accept the deterministic conclusion\nof the above argument, and if the argument is accepted as valid, then\nwe have to question at least one of the premises. Not taking premise 5\ninto consideration, this leaves us with the premises 1, 2, and 3.\nAccording to the reaction (b), premise 3 is rejected. Reaction (c)\nimplies the rejection of premise 1 in the argument. Reaction (d)\nimplies the rejection of premise 2.\n\nLavenham took option (a) to imply that there is no human freedom. In\nhis understanding (b) would mean that God does not know future\ncontingents. He rejected both (a) and (b) as contrary to the Christian\nfaith.\n\nIt seems that Lavenham, like William of Ockham (c. 1287\u20131347),\ntook Aristotle to hold that propositions about the contingent future\nare neither true nor false. A number of scholastic logicians favored\nthis Aristotelian view (c), for instance Peter Aureole\n(c.1280\u20131322). Lavenham, however, rejected this view. He\ninsisted that future contingents are either true or false now, and\nthat God knows the truth-values of all future contingents. He\npreferred (d), and he argued that by rejecting the necessity of the\npast as a general principle the doctrines of free will and God\u2019s\nforeknowledge of the contingent future can be united in a consistent\nmanner. This solution was first formulated by Ockham, although some of\nits elements can already be found in Anselm of Canterbury\n(1033\u20131109). It is also interesting that Leibniz\n(1646\u20131711) much later worked with a similar idea as a part of\nhis metaphysics. (See \u00d8hrstr\u00f8m 1984.)\n\nThe most characteristic feature of Lavenham\u2019s solution is the\nconcept of the true future. The view is that God possesses certain\nknowledge not only of the necessary future, but also of the contingent\nfuture. This means that among the possible contingent futures there\nmust be one which has a special status, namely that it corresponds to\nthe course of events which is going to happen or take place in the\nfuture. This line of thinking may be called the medieval solution,\neven though other approaches certainly existed. Its justification is\npartly the observation that the notion of the true future is the\nspecifically medieval contribution to the discussion, and partly that\nleading medieval logicians regarded this solution as the best one.\nLavenham himself called it \u201copinio modernorum\u201d, i.e., the\nopinion of the modern people. Lavenham argued that the notion of the\ntrue future can be maintained together with indeterminism, if the\nassumption of the necessity of the past is rejected. This will be\nexplained in more detail in sections 2 and 5.\n\nA later contribution by the Jesuit Luis Molina (1535\u20131600) is\nrelevant for a modern interpretation of the concept of the true\nfuture. Molina\u2019s ideas have been thoroughly discussed in (Craig\n1988). Molina\u2019s special contribution is the idea of\n(God\u2019s) middle knowledge, \u201cby which, in virtue of the most\nprofound and inscrutable comprehension of each free will, He saw in\nHis own essence what each such will would do with its innate freedom\nwere it to be placed in this or that or indeed in infinitely many\norders of things \u2014 even though it would really be able, if it so\nwilled, to do the opposite\u201d (quoted from Craig 1988, p. 175).\nCraig goes on to explain it as follows: \u201c\u2026 whereas by His\nnatural knowledge God knows that, say, Peter when placed in a certain\nset of circumstances could either betray Christ or not betray\nChrist, being free to do either under identical circumstances, by His\nmiddle knowledge God knows what Peter would do if placed\nunder those circumstances\u201d (Craig 1988, p. 175).\n\nAs Lavenham knew, William of Ockham had discussed the problem of\ndivine foreknowledge and human freedom in his work Tractatus de\npraedestinatione et de futuris contingentibus. (See William of\nOckham 1983.) Ockham asserted that God knows the truth or falsity of\nall future contingents, but he also maintained that human beings can\nchoose between alternative possibilities. In his Tractatus he\nargued that the doctrines of divine foreknowledge and human freedom\nare compatible. Richard of Lavenham made a remarkable effort to\ncapture and clearly present the logical features of Ockham\u2019s\nsystem as opposed to (what was assumed to be) Aristotle\u2019s\nsolution, i.e., (c).\n\nIn the following section a formal version of the medieval argument for\ndeterminism will be presented without theological references. It will\nbe demonstrated that at least two of the premises used in the argument\nmay be questioned. In section 3 we shall present a particularly\nimportant framework for the discussion of future contingents known as\nbranching time and its semantics. In sections 4 and 5 we shall see how\nthese possible reactions to the classical argument may be turned into\nmodern truth-theories corresponding to the medieval positions listed\nabove.\n",
