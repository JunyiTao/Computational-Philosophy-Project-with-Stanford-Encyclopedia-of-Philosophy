    "main_text": "\n\nThe definition of art is controversial in contemporary philosophy.\nWhether art can be defined has also been a matter of controversy.  The\nphilosophical usefulness of a definition of art has also been\ndebated.\n Contemporary definitions can be classified with respect to the\ndimensions of art they emphasize. One distinctively modern,\nconventionalist, sort of definition focuses on art\u2019s\ninstitutional features, emphasizing the way art changes over time,\nmodern works that appear to break radically with all traditional art,\nthe relational properties of artworks that depend on works\u2019\nrelations to art history, art genres, etc. \u2013 more broadly, on\nthe undeniable heterogeneity of the class of artworks.  The more\ntraditional, less conventionalist sort of definition defended in\ncontemporary philosophy makes use of a broader, more traditional\nconcept of aesthetic properties that includes more than art-relational\nones, and puts more emphasis on art\u2019s pan-cultural and\ntrans-historical characteristics \u2013 in sum, on commonalities\nacross the class of artworks. Hybrid definitions aim to do justice to\nboth the traditional aesthetic dimension as well as to the\ninstitutional and art-historical dimensions of art, while privileging\nneither.\n",
