    "main_text": "Psychological-Continuity Views\n4. Psychological-Continuity Views\n\nMost people\u2014most Western philosophy teachers and students,\nanyway\u2014feel immediately drawn to psychological-continuity views.\nIf your brain were transplanted, and that organ carried with it your\nmemories and other mental features, the resulting person would be\nconvinced that he or she was you. This can make it easy to suppose\nthat she would be you, and this would be so because of her\npsychological relation to you. But there is no easy path from this\nthought to an attractive answer to the persistence question.\n\nWhat psychological relation might it be? We have already mentioned\nmemory: a past or future being might be you just if you can now\nremember an experience she had then or vice versa. This proposal faces\ntwo historical objections, dating to Sergeant and Berkeley in the 18th\ncentury (see Behan 1979) but more famously discussed by Reid and\nButler (see the snippets in Perry 1975).\n\nFirst, suppose a young student is fined for overdue library books, and\nas a middle-aged lawyer remembers paying the fine. In her dotage,\nhowever, she remembers her law career but has entirely forgotten not\nonly paying the fine but all the other events of her youth. According\nto the memory criterion the young student is the middle-aged lawyer,\nthe lawyer is the elderly woman, but the elderly woman is not the\nyoung student. This is an impossible result: if x and\ny are one and y and z are one, x\nand z cannot be two. Identity is transitive; memory\ncontinuity is not.\n\nSecond, it seems to belong to the very idea of remembering that you\ncan remember only your own experiences. To remember paying a fine (or\nthe experience of it) is to remember yourself paying. That\nmakes it uninformative to say that you are the person whose\nexperiences you can remember\u2014that memory continuity is\nsufficient for us to persist. It\u2019s uninformative because we\ncould not know whether someone genuinely remembers a past experience\nwithout already knowing whether she is the one who had it. Suppose we\nask whether Blott, who exists now, is the same as Clott, whom we know\nto have existed at some past time. The memory criterion tells us that\nBlott is Clott just if Blott can now remember an experience Clott had\nthen. But Blott\u2019s seeming to remember one of Clott\u2019s\nexperiences counts as genuine memory only if Blott actually is Clott.\nSo we should already have to know whether Blott is Clott before we\ncould apply the principle that is supposed to tell us whether she is.\n(There is, however, nothing uninformative about the claim that memory\nconnections are necessary for us to persist\u2014that you\ncannot survive in a condition in which you are unable to remember\nanything, for example.)\n\nOne response to the first problem (about transitivity) is to modify\nthe memory criterion by switching from direct to indirect memory\nconnections: the old woman is the young student because she can recall\nexperiences the lawyer had at a time when the lawyer remembered the\nstudent\u2019s life. The second problem is commonly met by replacing\nmemory with \u201cquasi-memory\u201d, which is just like memory but\nwithout the identity requirement: even if it\u2019s impossible to\nremember doing something you didn\u2019t do but someone else did, you\ncould still \u201cquasi-remember\u201d it (Penelhum 1970: 85ff.,\nShoemaker 1970; for criticism see McDowell 1997).\n\nBut there remains the obvious problem that there are many times in our\npasts that we cannot remember or quasi-remember at all, and to which\nwe are not linked even indirectly by an overlapping chain of memories.\nThere is no time when you could recall anything that happened to you\nwhile you dreamlessly slept last night. The memory criterion has the\nabsurd implication that you have never existed at any time when you\nwere unconscious, and that the person sleeping in your bed last night\nwas someone else.\n\nA better solution replaces memory with the more general notion of\ncausal dependence (Shoemaker 1984, 89ff.). We can define two notions,\npsychological connectedness and psychological continuity. A being is\npsychologically connected, at some future time, with you as\nyou are now just if she is in the psychological states she is in then\nin large part because of the psychological states you are in\nnow (and this causal link is of the right sort: see Shoemaker 1979).\nHaving a current memory (or quasi-memory) of an earlier experience is\none sort of psychological connection\u2014the experience causes the\nmemory of it\u2014but there are others. The important point is that\nour current mental states can be caused in part by mental states we\nwere in at times when we were unconscious. For example, most of your\ncurrent beliefs are the same ones you had while you slept last night:\nthey have caused themselves to continue existing. You are then\npsychologically continuous, now, with a past or future being\njust if some of your current mental states relate to those he or she\nis in then by a chain of psychological connections.\n\nThat would enable us to say that a person x who exists at one\ntime is the same thing as something y existing at another\ntime just if x is, at the one time, psychologically\ncontinuous with y as it is at the other time. This avoids the\nmost obvious objections to the memory criterion.\n\nIt still leaves important questions unanswered, however. Suppose we\ncould somehow copy all the mental contents of your brain to mine, much\nas we can copy the contents of one computer drive to another, thereby\nerasing the previous contents of both brains. Whether this would be a\ncase of psychological continuity depends on what sort of causal\ndependence counts. The resulting being (with my brain and your mental\ncontents) would be mentally as you were before, and not as I was. He\nwould have inherited your mental properties in a way\u2014but a funny\none. Is it the right way? Could you literally move from one organism\nto another by \u201cbrain-state transfer\u201d?\nPsychological-continuity theorists disagree. (Shoemaker (1984:\n108\u2013111, 1997) says yes; Unger (1990: 67\u201371) says no; see\nalso van Inwagen 1997.)\n",
