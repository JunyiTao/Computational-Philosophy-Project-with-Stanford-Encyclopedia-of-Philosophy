    "main_text": "War, Violence and Punishment\n6. War, Violence and Punishment\n\nThe Buddhist tradition generally sees war and violence as deeply\nmorally problematic. War is seen as tragic and typically unnecessary,\nand the position of a soldier is seen as highly karmically dangerous.\nViolence directly causes harm and suffering to sentient beings,\npollutes the minds of those who use it, and creates cycles of hatred\nand retribution that can inflict terrible damage, both physical and\npsychological.\n\nIn general, the Buddhist attitude toward violence is expressed in\nverses X. 1\u20132 of the Dhammapada:\n\nEverybody fears being struck by a rod.\n\nEverybody fears death.\n\nTherefore, knowing this, feeling for others as for yourself,\n\nDo not kill others or cause others to kill.\n\nEverybody fears being struck by a rod,\n\nLife being dear to all.\n\nTherefore, knowing this, feeling for others as for yourself,\n\nDo not kill others or cause others to kill.\n\n(Maitreya, trans, 1995, 37)\n\n\nThe phrase translated \u201cfeeling for others as for yourself\u201d\nis the P\u0101li att\u0101na\u1e43 upama\u1e43\nkatv\u0101, which might be more literally rendered as\n\u201chaving made an analogy with oneself.\u201d Here a form of\nmoral reasoning is used that is quite similar to the Golden Rule:\nimaginatively put yourself in the place of others, and you will see\nthat certain ways of treating them are morally impermissible. The\nDhammapada also tells us:\n\nWhoever withholds the rod from creatures\n\nBoth weak and strong,\n\nAbstaining from killing and causing killing\n\nHim do I call a Noble One.\n\n(Maitreya, trans, 1995, 107)\n\n\nBuddhists explicitly reject the Hindu teaching that a soldier in a\njust war will be reborn in a heavenly realm. Instead, Buddhists hold\nthat those who die in battle are likely to be reborn as animals or in\nthe hells, especially if they die with a feeling of anger or hatred\ntoward the soldiers on the other side. In his commentary on the\nFour Hundred Stanzas (Catu\u1e25\u015bataka) of\n\u0100ryadeva, Candrak\u012brti expresses a very low opinion of those\nwho give their lives in battle for their king and country: \u201cIn\nthis world people who give up all of their possessions for gambling,\nliquor, and prostitutes are not entitled to respect. Virtuous-minded\npeople do not honor the sacrifice of these people, since they pursue\nan addiction. In the same way, the sacrifice of life in battle should\nnot be respected, since this is the basis for harmful actions\u201d\n(Lang trans., 2003, 200). He also criticizes the view that kings may\npermissibly engage in warfare, and offers what looks like a general\nstatement of pacifism: \u201ca sage is inferior when his treatises\nexplain violence as virtuous behavior. A mediocre sage has doubts:\n\u2018it may be so or it may not be so.\u2019 A superior sage does\nnot regard violence as virtuous behavior\u201d (Lang trans., 2003,\n197).\n\nBuddhist monks, especially in the Therav\u0101da tradition, are\nexpected to practice a strict form of non-violence; they should prefer\nbeing killed to killing others, and should even practice\nlovingkindness and compassion toward those who harm them or their\nfamilies. The Buddha himself is said to have mediated a dispute over\nwater rights between two neighboring kingdoms, preventing it from\nescalating into an armed conflict. In troubled times, Buddhist monks\nhave often sought opportunities to bring about peace and the\nresolution of conflict through dialogue. Normative Buddhist texts\npraise the role of peacemaker and an attitude of impartial benevolence\ntoward all parties to a conflict (see, e.g., Thurman trans. 2000, 70).\nThe Buddhist attitude toward war is thus quite negative, and passages\nglorifying military victory or sanitizing the realities of warfare are\nhard to find in Indian and Tibetan Buddhist texts.\n\nNevertheless, the common perception of Buddhism as a whole as an\nunequivocally pacifist tradition is questionable. Many forms of\nBuddhism have arrived at the position that in rare cases, war may be\nnecessary.\n\nOne way that Buddhist ethical theory might be used, in certain extreme\ncases, to justify war relies on Asa\u1e45ga\u2019s account of\njustifiable killing, discussed in section 4 above. For example, if the\nofficials of a militarily powerful state, monitoring the situation in\na small developing country, see that a genocide has begun to take\nplace there, they might reflect that those who are now committing\ngenocide are not only causing terrible harm to their victims, but also\naccumulating severe negative karma for themselves. These officials\nmight decide to intervene to stop the genocide, motivated by\ncompassion for everyone involved, including the killers. If they are\nsincerely motivated in this way, Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhists might\nsee their actions as acceptable, even if they involved using military\nforce and killing many people, because less suffering would result and\nthe overall consequences would therefore be much better.\n\nAs Stephen Jenkins has shown in an important recent article, a number\nof influential Mah\u0101y\u0101na texts provide arguments of this\ngeneral type. Both Candrak\u012brti and N\u0101g\u0101rjuna offer the\nexample \u201cof a physician, certainly one of the most important and\npervasive metaphors for a bodhisattva, amputating a finger that has\nbeen bitten by a poisonous snake, thus preventing the spread of\ngreater suffering\u201d (Jenkins 2011, 12). Candrak\u012brti then\ndevelops this theme through another example,\n\nof a hunter who kills one of his sons to prevent both from dying. The\ntwo sons are arguing at the edge of a precipice and one of them grabs\nthe other with the intention of hurling them both over. Since he\ncannot reach them, and so has no other option, the hunter shoots one\nson with an arrow to prevent them both from dying. This case shows a\nconcern for reducing the proportional extent of harm, as in the\nexample of amputation (Jenkins 2011, 15\u201316).\n How could the permissibility of shooting one son to save\nboth be reconciled with the seemingly pacifist statements offered\nelsewhere by Candrak\u012brti? Jenkins suggests (at 2011, 13) that we\ncan see the passages as consistent if we realize that the Sanskrit\nword hims\u0101, though translated by Lang and many other\nwriters as \u201cviolence,\u201d does not exactly correspond to our\nconcept of violence, and is somewhat closer in meaning to\n\u201charm.\u201d In killing one son to save both, it can be argued\nthat the hunter does not harm anyone, since the son who was shot with\nan arrow would have died anyway. Similarly, killing thugs intent on\ngenocide would clearly be an example of violence, but we would not\nnecessarily describe it as a harmful act, and it may not count as\nhims\u0101.\n\nSeveral Mah\u0101y\u0101na scriptures also contain statements\ninconsistent with an unqualified pacifism. For instance, the\nMah\u0101-parinirv\u0101\u1e47a S\u016btra states that it is\npermissible for someone with a pure intention to kill those who\npersecute Buddhism (Jenkins 2011, 18). Another scriptural text, the\nRange of the Bodhisattva\n(\u0101rya-bodhisattva-gocara), explicitly endorses defensive\nwarfare, when carried out with strict limitations and in order to\nprotect the people:\n\nAlthough in war, injury and death may be inflicted on the opposing\narmy, a ruler by his skillful means will commit less unspeakable and\nless nonvirtuous action and may not necessarily experience\nretribution, since he undertook such measures with heedfulness and\ncompassion. (Jamspal trans. 2010, 61)\n\n\nIn practice, Buddhist societies have not always refrained from war.\nFor example, between 1635 and 1642, the Mongol leader Gushri Khan\ninvaded Tibet, suppressed various warring factions, and placed supreme\npolitical power over the region in the hands of the dGe lugs tradition\nand its leader, His Holiness the Fifth Dalai Lama. In the Song of\nthe Queen of Spring, a text published in 1643, the Fifth Dalai\nLama describes Gushri Khan as an emanation of the great Bodhisattva\nVajrap\u0101ni, and justifies his warlike actions as motivated by\ncompassion (Maher 2008, 186\u201390). In Sri Lanka, Buddhist monks\nand rulers have endorsed the use of military force to defend their\nisland, seen as a sacred land and a sanctuary for the Buddhist\nreligion, against Hindu invaders from South India. During the recent\ncivil war, similar justifications were used to defend the use of\nmilitary measures against separatist rebels, mostly Hindus belonging\nto the Tamil minority. In general, Buddhist kings in many parts of the\nworld, including Southeast and Central Asia, have called on their\nmilitary forces to resist foreign invasions.\n\nBuddhist discussions of the ethics of punishment are fairly rare, but\nthere is an important passage about punishment in the Precious Garland\n(Ratn\u0101val\u012b), a letter to a king from the great\nBuddhist philosopher N\u0101g\u0101rjuna. Whether or not Buddhist\nethics in general is consequentialist, the theory of punishment\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna presents is clearly a consequentialist one. To\nmaintain social order, punishment is a regrettable necessity. But the\nking should not punish out of anger or a desire for revenge. Instead,\nhe should inflict punishment out of compassion, especially compassion\nfor the criminals themselves, whose destructive actions may have\ncondemned them to many lifetimes of suffering. (See Hopkins 1998 for a\ntranslation of the text and Goodman 2009, ch. 9, for discussion.)\n\nMoreover, punishment should be as mild as is consistent with achieving\nthe goal of restraining crime. Prisoners should be treated well and\nheld under humane conditions. Moreover, those prisoners who are\nphysically weak, and therefore pose less danger to society, should be\nreleased early. It\u2019s fairly clear that N\u0101g\u0101rjuna would\nreject retributivist theories of punishment, which hold that prisoners\nshould be punished because they deserve to suffer or in order to take\naway any unjust advantage they may have gained by their actions. From\nthe point of view of retributivism, the physical strength or weakness\nof prisoners is irrelevant to how much punishment they deserve.\nMoreover, some forms of retributivism, especially cruder, popular\nversions, would endorse harsh conditions of punishment in order to\nensure that prisoners have to undergo the degree of suffering that\nthey deserve.\n\nJust as Asa\u1e45ga\u2019s theory can be used to justify certain\nkinds of military action, it could also help justify punishment.\nPunishment can have a number of beneficial effects: it can\nincapacitate criminals, physically preventing them from repeating\ntheir crimes; it can deter criminals, inducing them to follow the law\nfrom fear of further punishment; it can rehabilitate criminals by\ngiving them education and skills that provide them with better options\nthan a life of crime; sometimes, it can even reform criminals, helping\nthem change their character to become better people, so that they will\nno longer wish to commit crimes. These good effects of punishment\nbenefit society, since they reduce the crime rate; but from a Buddhist\npoint of view, they also benefit criminals themselves by preventing\nthem from creating more bad karma. Thus punishment can be motivated by\ncompassion for both criminals and their victims, and so it could be\nacceptable in Buddhist ethics.\n\nSome people see Buddhism as maintaining unqualified pacifism and\nrejecting violence completely in general. In fact, some Buddhist\nscriptures and treatises do allow for extreme cases in which\ncompassionately motivated punishment, violence, and even war could be\njustified. They reserve their unqualified opposition for the reactive\nemotions that often lead to violence, such as anger, hatred, malice,\nand the desire for revenge. Buddhists should cultivate lovingkindness\nand compassion for everyone, even those guilty of the worst actions,\nand even while recognizing that some people need to be forcibly\nrestrained from doing even more damage. In a world that has been so\nterribly scarred by violence and cruelty, the Buddhist rejection of\nmost forms of warfare seems wise and appropriate. But in a complicated\nworld of difficult choices, allowing for the necessity of violence in\nrare instances may be difficult to avoid.\n",
