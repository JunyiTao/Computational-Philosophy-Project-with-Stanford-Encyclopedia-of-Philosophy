    "main_text": "Replies to Multiple Realizability Arguments: The First Forty Years || Challenging the Individuation of Mental Kinds\n2.4 Challenging the Individuation of Mental Kinds\n\nOver the past two decades philosophers have been more willing than\npreviously to challenge the truth of the multiple realizability\npremise itself (see\n \u00a73.2\n below.) One approach of this kind challenges the way proponents of\nmultiple realizability individuate mental kinds.\n\nAn early version of this argument is from Nick Zangwill (1992), who\nconcludes that multiple realizability across biological species has\n\u201cnever been proven\u201d. The multiple realizability contention\nassumes a type-identity of mental kinds across species. According to\nZangwill this assumption is problematic, given that the obvious\nsensory and motor differences across species by themselves yield\ndifferent cause-and-effect patterns at all but the grossest level of\ndescription. If successful, Zangwill\u2019s challenge undercuts the\nmultiple realizability argument by denying that the same mental kinds\nobtain across species, to be realized by different physical\nmechanisms.\n\nLawrence Shapiro (2000) also contends that philosophers are too quick\nto claim that a single given kind is multiply realized. Some\nproperties of the realizers are relevant to the purposes, activities,\nor capacities that define a given functional kind, but other\nproperties are not. Consider corkscrews. That functional kind can be\n\u201cmultiply realized\u201d in two tokens that differ only in\ntheir color. That physical difference does not make them genuinely\ndifferent realizations of corkscrew, however, because that one makes\nno relevant difference, that is, no difference to their performances\nas corkscrews. Similarly for two corkscrews that differ only in that\none is made of aluminum and the other of steel. Although that\ncompositional difference might matter for some functional kinds, it\ndoesn\u2019t matter for corkscrews. As Shapiro notes, \n\n\nsteel and aluminum are not different realizations of a\nwaiter\u2019s corkscrew because, relative to the properties that make\nthem suitable for removing corks, they are identical. (2000: 644) \n\n\nEstablishing relevant multiple realizability requires pointing to\nproperty differences in the realizers that make for a functional\ndifference for that kind of thing.\n\nShapiro then points out that this requirement sets up a dilemma for\nproponents of multiple realizability. Consider what appears to be a\ngenuine case of multiple realizability, that is, two objects that\n\u201cdo the same thing\u201d but in very different ways. Either the\nrealizing kinds genuinely differ in their causally relevant properties\nor they do not. If they do not, then we don\u2019t really have a case\nof multiple realizability (like the corkscrews that differ only in\ncolor or metal composition). If they do so differ, then they genuinely\nare different kinds. But then functionally they are not the same kind,\nand again we don\u2019t have an instance of multiple\nrealizability\u2014of a single functional kind with distinct\nrealizations.\n\nThe usual justification for grouping distinct realizers under a single\nfunctional kind is that such a classification reveals interesting\nsimilarities, of the sort we expect to be captured by laws or\ngeneralizations of some higher level science. But according to\nShapiro, when the realizing kinds differ significantly in their\ncausally relevant properties for the function at issue, any shared\nlaws or generalizations are \u201cnumbingly dull\u201d (2000: 649),\ne.g., all realizers of mouse traps can be used to catch mice, or both\ncamera eyes and compound eyes have the function of enabling the\norganism to see. Shapiro remarks: \n\n\nIf [functional kinds] share many causally relevant properties, then\nthey are not distinct realizations \u2026 If they have no or only\nfew causally relevant properties in common, then there are no or just\na few laws that are true of both of them. (2000: 649) \n\n\nThe first horn acknowledges a single functional kind but denies that\nit is multiply realized. The second horn undercuts the principal\nreason for grouping genuinely different physical kinds under a single\nfunctional kind. Shapiro concludes that taken together these two horns\nblunt any claim of multiple realizations of the same\nfunctional type. His argument has been central to more recent disputes\nas concerns about multiple realization shifted to the metaphysics of\nscience (see\n \u00a73).\n\nShapiro\u2019s dilemma is in the spirit of an earlier \u201ccausal\npowers\u201d argument from Jaegwon Kim (1992) Kim insists that\nscientific kinds are individuated by their causal powers, and the\ncausal powers of each instance of some realized kind are identical to\nthose of its realizer. From these principles it follows that instances\nof a mental kind with different physical realizations are distinct\nkinds because of the distinct causal powers of their realizers. A\nstructure-independent mental kind is not a causal kind, and hence is\ndisqualified as proper scientific kinds. Multiple realizability yields\nthe failure of structure-independent mental kinds to meet a standard\nof what makes something a scientific kind.\n\nMark Couch (2004) presses a related dilemma. Defending a claimed\nmultiple realization involves two steps. Proponents must show\n\n that the physical states (of the realizers) are type distinct,\nand \n that the functional properties are type identical. \n\n\nChallenges to claimed multiple realizations can attack either step,\nand most importantly, the step challenged can differ from case to\ncase. Successfully challenging either step blocks any multiple\nrealizability argument appealing to that kind. As we saw in the\nprevious section, Bechtel and Mundale (1999) describe cases in which\ncognitive neuroscientists treat the physical realizers (brain states)\nas type-identical across species, thus attacking step (i). In other\ncases\u2014Couch\u2019s example is primate versus octopus\neyes\u2014one can appeal to easily-found differences in functional\nproperties, attacking step (ii). The two types of eyes have different\nvisual pigments in their photoreceptors, different retinas, and\ndifferent ways of focusing light. These physical differences lead to\nstraightforward input-output (functional) differences: in the optic\nstimuli the two eyes respond to, in reaction times, and more. Their\nfunctions may be similar, but similarity isn\u2019t identity and the\nmultiple realization argument since Putnam\u2019s original version\n(see\n \u00a71.2\n above) requires identity at the realized functional kinds.\nCross-species functional similarities are often quite superficial,\nespecially across species from widely differing taxa (a point stressed\nby both Couch and Shapiro). In actual scientific practice, discovered\nphysical (neural) differences typically incline psychologists to\nsearch for functional differences. Couch\u2019s point is that the\nindividuation of psychological states, like the individuation of brain\nstates, is an empirical issue; Shapiro and Couch both suggest that\nclaims about multiple realizability often rely heavily on\n\u201cfolk\u201d psychological intuitions about individuating mental\nkinds.\n\nBechtel and Mundale (1999) note that proponents of multiple\nrealizability often appeal to different amounts of\n\u201cgranularity\u201d in how they individuate mental versus\nneurobiological kinds. Proponents often analyze psychological states\nat a coarse-grained level, in which only the loosest input-output\nsimilarities across species are deemed sufficient for mental kind\nidentities. Yet they insist on very fine-grained individuation for\nbrain states, in which small differences across species are sufficient\nfor neural type-differences. But psychological ascriptions admit of\nfiner grains and neural ascriptions admit of coarser grains. Bechtel\nand Mundale insist that when a common grain is chosen for both,\nmental-neural type-identities holding across species are found.\n\nThese responses quickly attracted critical counters. Carl Gillett\n(2003) argues that Fodor and other proponents of multiple\nrealizability assume a \u201cDimensioned\u201d view of realization\nthat allows realizer/realized properties to be instantiated in the\ndistinct individuals that bear part-whole relations to one\nanother. Shapiro instead assumes a \u201cFlat\u201d view of\nrealization, which demands that realizer/realized properties be\ninstantiated in the same individual. Gillett argues that\nShapiro\u2019s arguments fail under the Dimensioned view of\nrealization, and that he never defends the Flat view over the\nDimensioned view. Gillett concludes that failing to directly address\nthe nature of the realization relation more generally vitiates\nShapiro\u2019s critique, leaving it as simply begging the question\nagainst Fodor\u2019s and others original defenses of the multiple\nrealization premise. These more general accounts later emerged to\ndominate more recent discussions (see\n \u00a73\n below). \n",
