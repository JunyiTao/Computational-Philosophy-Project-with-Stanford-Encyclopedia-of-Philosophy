    "main_text": "Plato\u2019s puzzles\n2. Plato\u2019s puzzles\n\nAlthough these propositions are often identified by Plato\u2019s\nreaders as forming a large part of the core of his philosophy, many of\nhis greatest admirers and most careful students point out that few, if\nany, of his writings can accurately be described as mere advocacy of a\ncut-and-dried group of propositions. Often Plato\u2019s works exhibit\na certain degree of dissatisfaction and puzzlement with even those\ndoctrines that are being recommended for our consideration. For\nexample, the forms are sometimes described as hypotheses (see for\nexample Phaedo). The form of good in particular is described\nas something of a mystery whose real nature is elusive and as yet\nunknown to anyone at all (Republic). Puzzles are\nraised\u2014and not overtly answered\u2014about how any of\nthe forms can be known and how we are to talk about them without\nfalling into contradiction (Parmenides), or about what it is\nto know anything (Theaetetus) or to name anything\n(Cratylus). When one compares Plato with some of the other\nphilosophers who are often ranked with him\u2014Aristotle, Aquinas,\nand Kant, for example\u2014he can be recognized to be far more\nexploratory, incompletely systematic, elusive, and playful than they.\nThat, along with his gifts as a writer and as a creator of vivid\ncharacter and dramatic setting, is one of the reasons why he is often\nthought to be the ideal author from whom one should receive\none\u2019s introduction to philosophy. His readers are not presented\nwith an elaborate system of doctrines held to be so fully worked out\nthat they are in no need of further exploration or development;\ninstead, what we often receive from Plato is a few key ideas together\nwith a series of suggestions and problems about how those ideas are to\nbe interrogated and deployed. Readers of a Platonic dialogue are drawn\ninto thinking for themselves about the issues raised, if they are to\nlearn what the dialogue itself might be thought to say about them.\nMany of his works therefore give their readers a strong sense of\nphilosophy as a living and unfinished subject (perhaps one that can\nnever be completed) to which they themselves will have to contribute.\nAll of Plato\u2019s works are in some way meant to leave further work\nfor their readers, but among the ones that most conspicuously fall\ninto this category are: Euthyphro, Laches,\nCharmides, Euthydemus, Theaetetus, and\nParmenides.\n",
