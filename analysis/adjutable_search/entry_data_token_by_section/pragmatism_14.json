This\nfocus on the intrinsically good or admirable broadens the purview of\naesthetics, which Peirce claims \u2018has been handicapped by the\ndefinition of it as the theory of beauty\u2019 (CP 2.199, 1902).\nAesthetics is one of the least well worked-out areas of Peirce\u2019s\nphilosophy; nevertheless he says some intriguing and suggestive things\nabout it. For instance he argues that the so-called summum\nbonum (ultimate good) really consists in the growth of\n\u2018concrete reasonableness\u2019 (CP 1.602; 1.615; 2.34; 5.121;\n5.433), as the only phenomenon \u2018whose admirableness is not due\nto an ulterior reason\u2019 must be the furthering of Reason itself\n(CP 1.615, 1903). Recent further development of this framework\nincludes (Kaag 2014; Gava 2014). \n\nJames did not make sustained contributions to aesthetics, but Dewey\ndid, particularly in his 1934 book Art as Experience. Dewey\nviewed aesthetic appreciation as a peak human experience and\n\u2018the greatest intellectual achievement in the history of\nhumanity\u2019 (LW10:31, cited in Hildebrand 2008: 146). Consequently\nthe most important question in this area of philosophy is not how to\ndefine necessary and sufficient conditions for Art, but how to enable\nordinary people to enjoy more of it, so that their lives might be more\nmeaningful. The way forward, Dewey suggested, is to learn to fetishize\nprofessionally-curated contexts and Art objects less, in order to open\nour eyes to consummatory experiences as they occur in the everyday\nexperience of the \u2018live creature\u2019. Examples of such\nconsummations include: \u2018[a] piece of work is finished in a way\nthat is satisfactory; a problem receives its solution; a game is\nplayed through\u2026\u2019 (LW10:42). In contrast to such\nintegrated completions within experience, both hedonistic dissipation\nand rigid self-control count as \u2018anesthetic\u2019. True art\nalternates between doing and undergoing. Notable recent work building\non Dewey\u2019s aesthetics includes Richard Shusterman\u2019s\nsomaesthetics, which extends pragmatism\u2019s defining\ninterest in agency to exploring the complex role of the human body in\naesthetic experience (Shusterman 1992; 2012).\n",
