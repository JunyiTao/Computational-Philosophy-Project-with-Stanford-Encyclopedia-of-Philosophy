    "main_text": "Biography\n1. Biography\n\n\nHolbach was born in 1723 in Edesheim. He was raised in Paris,\nprincipally by his uncle, Franciscus Adam d\u2019Holbach, and\nattended the University of Leiden from 1744 to 1748 or 1749. Holbach\nparticularly enjoyed the parties there. It is likely that, at least at\nfirst, the dinners Holbach gave in Paris were modelled on the parties\nhe attended at Leiden. In 1749, Holbach married his second cousin,\nBasile-Genevi\u00e8ve d\u2019Aine. About 1753 or 1754 both his\nuncle, Franciscus, and his father in law died, leaving Holbach a\nconsiderable fortune. \n\n\nHolbach used his great wealth to throw the dinner parties for which he\nis famous. He owned a house in Paris in rue Royale, Butte Saint-Roch,\nwhich, generally, had a guest list restricted to serious\nintellectuals, and a chateau at Grandval where, in addition to his\ncoterie, Holbach also hosted social friends and\nrelatives. Holbach\u2019s coterie included intellectuals who,\nalthough their positions varied on many issues, shared at least a\nwillingness to entertain views that many would have thought too\nradical to be discussed in social settings. The coterie met from the\n1750s into the 1780s. The group evolved over time, but its core\nmembers, Alan Kors has argued, were Denis Diderot, the encyclopedist;\nthe diplomat and cultural critic Friedrich-Melchior Grimm; the\nnaturalist Charles-Georges Le Roy; the writer and critic\nJean-Fran\u00e7ois Marmontel; the historian and priest abb\u00e9\nGuillame-Thomas-Fran\u00e7ois Raynal; the doctor Augustin Roux; the\npoet and philosopher Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Saint-Lambert; the writer\nJean-Baptiste-Antoine Suard; the pamphleteer Fran\u00e7ois-Jean,\nchevalier de Chastellux, the pamphleteer abb\u00e9 Andr\u00e9\nMorellet; and the philosopher Jacques-Andr\u00e9 Naigeon. Many of\nthese men were, like Holbach, avowed atheists and many also pushed\nradical, even revolutionary political agendas. So the general\ncharacter of his coterie might suggest that Holbach was a figure on\nthe fringe of Parisian society, a kind of eccentric parvenu with a\ntaste for scandal.\n\n\nHowever, Holbach managed, despite what one might expect, to keep his\ncoterie firmly in the mainstream of European society. French nobles,\nas well as ambassadors from countries across Europe\u2014Denmark,\nEngland, Naples, Saxe-Gotha, Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, Wurtemburg, and\nSweden\u2014attended his dinners. So did prominent intellectuals of\nall kinds, including, at different times and with different degrees of\nenthusiasm, the philosopher and novelist Jean-Jacques Rousseau, the\nmathematician Jean Le Rond d\u2019Alembert, the historian Edward\nGibbon, the writer Horace Walpole, the chemist Joseph Priestley, the\nsocial critic Cesare Beccaria, the philosopher Nicolas-Antoine\nBoulanger, the statesman and scientist Benjamin Franklin, the actor\nDavid Garrick, the philosopher Claude-Adrien Helv\u00e9tius, the\nphilosopher David Hume, the economist Adam Smith, and the novelist\nLaurence Sterne. Holbach was known in France not primarily as a\npolitical radical but as le premier ma\u00eetre\nd\u2019h\u00f4tel de la philosophie. Many in Paris coveted\ninvitations to rue Royale, and Holbach\u2019s house was the first\nstop for many prominent international visitors.\n\n\nHolbach\u2019s character must have been remarkable to have maintained\na salon in which the espousers of political and religious reform met\nso freely and so often with visitors who either cannot have been\naccustomed to such open dialogue or who were themselves parts of the\nestablishment under attack. Indeed Rousseau, who himself came to feel\nunwelcome by the coterie, nevertheless memorializes Holbach in La\nnouvelle Helo\u00efse, as the paradoxical figure, Wolmar, an\natheist who nonetheless embodies all of the Christian virtues. In\naddition to his good character, Holbach\u2019s generosity at table\n(his dinners and especially his wine were famously good) and in\nsupporting many of his acquaintances may explain his success at being\nboth a pillar and a critic of society. Perhaps, also, Holbach was not\nin the eyes of many of his contemporaries as clearly a radical as some\nother members of his coterie. He did publish some of the most\nnotorious works of the French Enlightenment, including Le\nChristianisme d\u00e9voil\u00e9 (Christianity\nUnveiled),\nSyst\u00e8me de la nature (System of Nature) and\nLe Bon Sens (Common Sense). These books evoked long\nand heated responses from such notable figures as Voltaire, abb\u00e9\nBergier, and Frederick the Great; System of Nature and\nCommon Sense were condemned by the parliament of Paris and\npublicly burned. Holbach, however, was not in his own time as notorious\nas his books. He was careful always to publish anonymously, so that\nthose who did not know him or who did not care to think of him in that\nway, might have remained at least partially ignorant of his religious\nand political views.\n\n\nHolbach\u2019s coterie met for thirty years, from the early 1750s until\nabout 1780. During that time his first wife died and he married her\nyounger sister, Charlotte Suzanne d\u2019Aine, with whom he had four\nchildren. Holbach wrote prolifically throughout this time. According to\nVercruysse, Holbach authored or coauthored over fifty books and over\nfour hundred articles. He died in 1789.\n",
