It was,\nessentially, a bodily manifestation of God. Nothing in the universe, however\n\u201cmean\u201d, was \u201cunconducive to the integrity and\nperfection of what is excellent\u201d. There was \u201cnothing that\nis bad for some things in some place that is not good and optimal for\nsomething elsewhere\u201d (BOL I.3, 272). Philosophers through the\nages had said much the same, as had scholastic authors. \u201cThe\ndeath of a fly\u201d, wrote Thomas Aquinas (Super\nSententiis, lib. 1, d. 39, q. 2 a. 2 co.) \u201cis sustenance\nfor a spider\u201d. Then Thomas added a qualification. Creatures\nnobler than the irrational animals, for example, human beings, have a\nwill, which, the more closely it cleaved to God, was \u201cthe more\nfree from the necessity of natural causes\u201d (ibid.). The cosmos\nprovided the setting for human beings to demonstrate that they merited\neverlasting salvation. For Bruno, however, they were, no less than\nanything else, transient modes or \u201ccorruptible\nsubstances\u201d, in essence, \u201caccidents\u201d of the One\nBeing (BOI I, 664, 729; II, 125, 181\u2013182). They were, as for Spinoza (Ethics, pt IV, prop. 4), part of nature, not a privileged species for which, as Christian doctrine maintained, nature had been created.\n\nHuman beings, understood as combinations of body and soul, perished.\nBut what of their souls? Bruno stated unequivocally that they were\nindividual, that is to say, that they were indestructible,\n\u201catomic\u201d. Death was an illusion, no more than the\ndissolution of an ephemeral conjunction of soul and matter. We should\nawait mutation serenely, not fear death, as Pythagoras, or more exactly Ovid\u2019s \u2018Pythagoras\u2019, had\nrightly observed (Ovid, Metamorphoses, 15.153\u2013175; BOI I, 665). Bruno\u2019s doctrine of metempsychosis required\nhim to uphold the soul\u2019s immortality, even though, as he noted,\nhe interpreted the doctrine differently from Pythagoras, Pythagoreans,\nPlato, Platonists, the Sadducees, Scripture (Psalm 36:6 [KJV]), Origen\nand the Druids. Souls of the dead did not endure a shadowy existence\nin some other world before reincarnation in the manner that the\n\u201cPythagorean\u201d Virgil (Aeneid, VI.743\u2013751)\nand others had described (BOI II, 511\u2013515). That is to say, on\nthe death of one body, a soul did not retain the personality that it had accrued and commandeer another body, like a\nhelmsman changing ships. Rather, we should understand that the soul\nturned its operative powers to forming a new body, the limitations of\nwhich were determined by Providence (BOL III, 257,\n429\u2013430). What made ancient accounts worthy of close\nconsideration was the underlying idea that souls were punished or\nrewarded for their conduct. The One Being, as Providence or Fate,\nensured that, by means of the perpetual change or vicissitude which it\nimposed on natural things, retributive justice prevailed (BOI II,\n180\u2013185, 197, 457\u2013459). A soul that behaved like a pig had\nbeen a pig in a previous incarnation or, on account of its conduct,\nwas doomed to become a pig in the next.  Bruno\u2019s patron in\nVenice, Giovanni Mocenigo, reported to the Inquisition that Bruno had\nonce admonished him for killing a spider.  It may have been, he had\nremarked, the incarnation of a former friend of his (Firpo 2000, 341,\ndoc. 51, \u00a722.179).  In keeping with these convictions, Bruno, inspired\nby Erasmus or perhaps Agrippa von Nettesheim, condemned the\naristocratic obsession with hunting and the customs that it nurtured\n(BOI II, 388\u2013389).\n\nHis doctrine of minims (see\n Section 3) \nexplained the individual soul\u2019s survival of bodily\ndeath. A soul was an incorporeal centre of animation governing the\natoms conglomerating around it as the body grew and flourished. As the\nbody grew older and decayed, the soul contracted its powers inwardly,\neventually dissociating itself altogether from the body. It remained,\nnevertheless, an individual centre of animation capable of forming\nanother body. Insofar, however, as it was disengaged from dimension,\nit \u201cexpanded\u201d seamlessly into the infinite space of the\nuniverse. Or rather, given that infinite space was replete with souls,\nit expanded into the aether or spiritus diffused throughout\nspace. Hence, in the Kabbala of the Pegasean Horse (1585),\none of his most irreligious works, Bruno described an ass who, on his\ndeath, passed into the underworld and noticed there \u201cthat all\nspirits are from the sea of one spirit and that all return to that\nspirit\u201d (BOI II, 450\u2013451). This interpretation of\nspiritus as the unity of discrete individual souls, distinct\nfrom the undifferentiated unity of the Universal Soul, conformed with\nBruno\u2019s elemental theory and definition of space in relation to Universal\nMatter (see\n Section 3).\nScripture, as always, supported his view.\n\n\nWell it is said, too, in Holy Scripture [Ecclesiastes 12:7]\nthat the body dissolves into dust, that is to say, atoms [see again\n Section 3], and that the\nspirit returns to its source [God]. (BOL III, 256)\n\n\nHow could an individual soul endowed with human body, one that encouraged the development of its rational and intellectual potential, ensure a prosperous reincarnation? By turning, as many before Bruno had urged, from the world of sense data\nto the intelligible principles underlying it. From sensibilia the soul\ncomposed intelligibilia by virtue of the intelligible light of the\nUniversal Intellect, in which all souls, as indeed all other things to\nsome degree (see Section 5),\nparticipated. These intelligibilia were \u201cshadows of the\nIdeas\u201d rather than the Ideas of the Universal Intellect\nthemselves. The philosopher\u2019s soul yearned to pass beyond these\nshadows to the Ideas of which the Universal Intellect was the unity\nand so \u201cattune its thoughts and deeds to the symmetry of the law\ninscribed in all things\u201d (BOI II, 557). The final step that he\ncould take was to understand the Ideas, not discretely, but as a\nunity. He came, in other words, to understand the Universal\nIntellect. Given that, following an almost universally accepted\nprinciple going back to Aristotle, intellection entailed the\nidentification of the intellectual subject with the object of\nintellection, the philosopher at this juncture lost his individual\nintellectual identity. He was taken out of himself and, identified\nwith Nature (in the first of the senses mentioned in\n Section 5),\nknew himself as part of the divine presence in the universe. Beyond\nthis, he could not pass. He could discover God\u2019s\n\u201cshadow\u201d, an allusion to Corinthians (I 13:12; II 3:18),\nthat is, \u201cthe world, the universe and Nature that is in\nthings\u201d, the \u201cmonad\u201d that \u201cproceeds from the\nmonad that is divinity\u201d. He could gaze upon this \u201cimage of\n him\u201d, but not his \u201cabsolute light\u201d (BOI II,\n694\u2013697). God as the One Being, both in his inner and external\naspect (see\n Section 5), remained unknowable.\nThe few who aspired to perfection in this way were\n\u201cdivine\u201d, \u201cheroic\u201d, \u201crare\u201d men,\ninspired by \u201ca superior light\u201d (BOI I, 453, 475, 525; II,\n595). These aspirations inspired Bruno\u2019s doctrine of \n\u201clove\u201d in his prose-poem masterpiece, The Heroic Frenzies (Nelson, 1958), and his interpretation of creative genius (BOI II, 528).\nHis art of memory and Llullism, in their\ntheoretical applications, were additional resources in this pursuit of\nself-fulfillment. By constructing a memory palace that mirrored the\nhierarchical structure of the intelligible universe, the soul could\nmove from the accidental multiplicity of the universe to the unity of\nthe Universal Intellect and vice versa (Sturlese 1994). With the same purpose in mind,\nBruno designed and cut the wood engravings of ontological realities\nthat feature, like proto-Jungian mandala, in several of his works.\n\n\n\nGiordano Bruno, \u201cFigura intellectus\u201d, discussed in\nCorpus iconographicum.
