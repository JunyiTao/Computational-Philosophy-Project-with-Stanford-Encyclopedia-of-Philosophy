Why Learn the Symbolism in Principia Mathematica?\n\nPrincipia Mathematica [PM] was written jointly by Alfred\nNorth Whitehead and Bertrand Russell over several years, and published\nin three volumes, which appeared between 1910 and 1913. It presents a\nsystem of symbolic logic and then turns to the foundations of\nmathematics to carry out the logicist project of defining mathematical\nnotions in terms of logical notions and proving the fundamental axioms\nof mathematics as theorems of logic. While hugely important in the\ndevelopment of logic, philosophy of mathematics and more broadly of\n\u201cEarly Analytic Philosophy\u201d, the work itself is no longer\nstudied for these topics. As a result the very notation of the work\nhas become alien to contemporary students of logic, and that has\nbecome a barrier to the study of Principia Mathematica. We\ninclude a series of definitions of notions such as transfinite\ncardinal numbers, well-orderings, rational and real numbers. These are\ndefined differently in the theory of types of PM than than in\naxiomatic set theory. \n\nThis entry is intended to assist the student of PM in reading the\nsymbolic portion of the work. What follows is a partial translation of\nthe symbolism into a more contemporary notation, which should be\nfamiliar from other articles in this Encyclopedia, and which is quite\nstandard in contemporary textbooks of symbolic logic. No complete\nalgorithm is supplied, rather various suggestions are intended to help\nthe reader learn the symbolism of PM. Many issues of interpretation\nwould be prejudged by only using contemporary notation, and many\ndetails that are unique to PM depend on that notation. It will be seen\nbelow, with some of the more contentious aspects of the notation, that\ndoctrines of substance are built into the notation of PM. Replacing\nthe notation with a more modern symbolism would drastically alter the\nvery content of the book.\n",
