    "main_text": "The Emergence of Procedural Rationality || Proper and Improper Linear Models\n2.3 Proper and Improper Linear Models\n\nProper linear models represent another important class of optimization\nmodels. A proper linear model is one where predictor variables are\nassigned weights, which are selected so that the linear combination of\nthose weighted predictor variables optimally predicts a target\nvariable of interest. For example, linear regression is a proper\nlinear model that selects weights such that the squared\n\u201cdistance\u201d between the model\u2019s predicted value of\nthe target variable and the actual value (given in the data set) is\nminimized.\n\nPaul Meehl\u2019s review in the 1950s of psychological studies using\nstatistical methods versus clinical judgment cemented the statistical\nturn in psychology (Meehl 1954). Meehl\u2019s review found that\nstudies involving the prediction of a numerical target variable from\nnumerical predictors is better done by a proper linear model than by\nthe intuitive judgment of clinicians. Concurrently, the psychologist\nKenneth Hammond formulated Brunswik\u2019s lens model\n (section 3.2)\n as a composition of proper linear models to model the differences\nbetween clinical versus statistical predictions (K. Hammond 1955).\nProper linear models have since become a workhorse in cognitive\npsychology in areas that include decision analysis (Keeney &\nRaiffa 1976; Kaufmann & Wittmann 2016), causal inference\n(Waldmann, Holyoak, & Fratianne 1995; Spirtes 2010), and\nresponse-times to choice (Brown & Heathcote 2008; Turner,\nRodriguez, et al. 2016).\n\nRobin Dawes, returning to Meehl\u2019s question about statistical\nversus clinical predictions, found that even improper linear models\nperform better than clinical intuition (Dawes 1979). The\ndistinguishing feature of improper linear models is that the weights\nof a linear model are selected by some non-optimal method. For\ninstance, equal weights might be assigned to the predictor variables\nto afford each equal weight or a unit-weight, such as 1 or \u22121, to tally features supporting a positive or negative prediction,\nrespectively. As an example, Dawes proposed an improper model to\npredict subjective ratings of marital happiness by couples based on\nthe difference between their rates of lovemaking and fighting. The\nresults? Among the thirty happily married couples, two argued more\nthan they had intercourse. Yet all twelve unhappy couples fought more\nfrequently. And those results replicated in other laboratories\nstudying human sexuality in the 1970s. Both equal-weight regression\nand unit-weight tallying have since been found to commonly\noutperform proper linear models on small data sets. Although no simple\nimproper linear model performs well across all common benchmark\ndatasets, for almost every data set in the benchmark there is some\nsimple improper model that performs well in predictive accuracy\n(Lichtenberg & Simsek 2016). This observation, and many others in\nthe heuristics literature, points to biases of simplified models that\ncan lead to better predictions when used in the right circumstances\n (section 4).\n\nDawes\u2019s original point was not that improper linear models\noutperform proper linear models in terms of accuracy, but rather that\nthey are more efficient and (often) close approximations of proper\nlinear models. \u201cThe statistical model may integrate the\ninformation in an optimal manner\u201d, Dawes observed, \u201cbut it\nis always the individual \u2026who chooses variables\u201d (Dawes\n1979: 573). Moreover, Dawes argued that it takes human judgment to\nknow the direction of influence between predictor variables and target\nvariables, which includes the knowledge of how to numerically code\nthose variables to make this direction clear. Recent advances in\nmachine learning chip away at Dawes\u2019s claims about the unique\nrole of human judgment, and results from Gigerenzer\u2019s ABC Group\nabout unit-weight tallying outperforming linear regression in\nout-of-sample prediction tasks with small samples is an instance of\nimproper linear models outperforming proper linear models (Czerlinski,\nGigerenzer, & Goldstein 1999). Nevertheless, Dawes\u2019s general\nobservation about the relative importance of variable selection over\nvariable weighting stands (Katsikopoulos, Schooler, & Hertwig\n2010).\n",
