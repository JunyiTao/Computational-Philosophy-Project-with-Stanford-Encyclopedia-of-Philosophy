An early attempt at this was Automath (de Bruijn 1968)\nwhich was the first computer system used to check the correctness of\nproofs and whole books of mathematics, including Landau\u2019s\nGrundlagen der Analysis (van Benthem Jutting 1977). Automath\nhas been superseded by more modern and capable systems, most notably\nMizar. The Mizar system (Trybulec 1979, Muzalewski 1993) is based on\nTarski-Grothendieck set theory and, like Automath, consists of a\nformal language which is used to write mathematical theorems and their\nproofs. Once a proof is written in the language, it can be checked\nautomatically by Mizar for correctness. Mizar proofs are formal but\nquite readable, can refer to definitions and previously proved\ntheorems and, once formally checked, can be added to the growing Mizar\nMathematical Library (MML) (Bancerek & Rudnicki 2003, Bancerek\net al. 2018). As of June 2018, MML contained about 12,000\ndefinitions and 59,000 theorems. The Mizar language is a subset of\nstandard English as used in mathematical texts and is highly\nstructured to ensure the production of rigorous and semantically\nunambiguous texts. Here\u2019s a sample proof in Mizar of the existence of\na rational number xy where x and\ny are irrational: \n\n\ntheorem T2:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0ex x, y st x is irrational & y is irrational\n& x.^.y is rational\n\nproof\n\n\u00a0\u00a0set w = \u221a2;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0H1: w is irrational by INT_2:44,T1;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0w>0 by AXIOMS:22,SQUARE_1:84;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0then (w.^.w).^.w = w.^.(w\u2022w) by\nPOWER:38\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0.= w.^.(w2) by\nSQUARE_1:58\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0.= w.^.2 by SQUARE_1:88\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0.= w2 by POWER:53\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0.= 2 by SQUARE_1:88;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0then H2: (w.^.w).^.w is rational by\nRAT_1:8;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0per cases;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0suppose H3: w.^.w is rational;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0take w, w;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0thus thesis by H1,H3;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0suppose H4: w.^.w is irrational;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0take w.^.w, w;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0thus thesis by H1,H2,H4;\n\nend;\n\n\nExamples of proofs that have been checked by Mizar include the\nHahn-Banach theorem, the Brouwer fixed-point theorem, K\u0151nig\u2019s lemma,\nthe Jordan curve theorem, and G\u00f6del\u2019s completeness theorem.\nRudnicki (2004) discusses the challenges of formalizing Witt\u2019s proof\nof the Wedderburn theorem: Every finite division ring is commutative.\nThe theorem was formulated easily using the existing formalizations\navailable in MML but the proof demanded further entries into the\nlibrary to formalize notions and facts from algebra, complex numbers,\nintegers, roots of unity, cyclotomic polynomials, and polynomials in\ngeneral. It took several months of effort to supply the missing\nmaterial to the MML library but, once in place, the proof was\nformalized and checked correct in a matter of days. Clearly, a\nrepository of formalized mathematical facts and definitions is a\nprerequisite for more advanced applications. The QED Manifesto (Boyer\net al. 1994, Wiedijk 2007) has such aim in mind and there is\nmuch work to do: Mizar has the largest such repository but even after\n30 years of work \u201cit is minuscule with respect to the body of\nestablished mathematics\u201d (Rudnicki 2004). This last remark\nshould be construed as a call to increase the effort toward this\nimportant aspect in the automation of mathematics. \n\nMizar\u2019s goal is to assist the practitioner in the formalization of\nproofs and to help check their correctness; other systems aim at\nfinding the proofs themselves. Geometry has been a target of early\nautomated proof-finding efforts. Chou (1987) proves over 500 geometry\ntheorems using the algebraic approach offered by Wu\u2019s method and the\nGr\u00f6bner basis method by representing hypotheses and conclusions\nas polynomial equations. Quaife (1992) provides another early effort\nto find proofs in first-order mathematics: over 400 theorems in\nNeumann-Bernays-G\u00f6del set theory, over 1,000 theorems in\narithmetic, a number of theorems in Euclidian geometry, and\nG\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness theorems. The approach is best described\nas semi-automatic or \u201cinteractive\u201d with the user providing\na significant amount of input to guide the theorem-proving effort.\nThis is no surprise since, as one applies automated reasoning systems\ninto richer areas of mathematics, the systems take more on the role of\nproof assistants than theorem provers. This is because in richer\nmathematical domains the systems need to reason about theories and\nhigher-order objects which in general takes them deeper into the\nundecidable. Interactive theorem proving is arguably\nthe \u201ckiller\u201d application of automated reasoning in\nmathematics and much effort is being expended in the building of\nincreasingly capable reasoning systems that can act as assistants to\nprofessional mathematicians. The proof assistant Isabelle/HOL provides\nthe user with an environment in which to conduct proofs expressed in a\nstructured, yet human-readable, higher-order logic language and which\nincorporates a number of facilities that increase the user\u2019s\nproductivity, automates proof-verification and proof-finding tasks,\nand provides a modular way for the user to build and manage theory\nhierarchies (Ballarin 2014). \n\nDifferent proof assistants offer different capabilities measured by\ntheir power at automating reasoning tasks, supported logic, object\ntyping, size of mathematical library, and readability of input and\noutput. A \u201ccanonical\u201d proof which is not too trivial but\nnot too complex either can be used as a baseline for system\ncomparison, as done in (Wiedijk 2006) where the authors of seventeen\nreasoning systems are tasked with establishing the irrationality of\n\u221a2. The systems discussed are certainly more capable than this\nand some have been used to assist in the formalization of far more\nadvanced proofs such as Erd\u00f6s-Selberg\u2019s proof of the Prime Number\nTheorem (about 30,000 lines in Isabelle), the formalization of the\nFour Color Theorem (60,000 lines in Coq), and the Jordan Curve Theorem\n(75,000 lines in HOL Light). A milestone in interactive theorem\nproving was reached in 2012 when, after six-years of effort and using\nthe Coq proof assistant, George Gonthier and his team completed the\nformal verification of the 255-page proof of the Feit-Thompson\ntheorem, also known as the Odd Order Theorem, a major step in the\nclassification of finite simple groups. \n\nThe above notwithstanding, automated reasoning has had a small impact\non the practice of doing mathematics and there is a number of reasons\ngiven for this. One reason is that automated theorem provers are not\nsufficiently powerful to attempt the kind of problems mathematicians\ntypically deal with; that their current power is, at best, at the\nlevel of first-year undergraduate mathematics and still far from\nleading edge mathematical research. While it is true that current\nsystems cannot prove completely on their own problems at this level of\ndifficulty we should remember that the goal is to build reasoning\nsystems so that \u201ceventually machines are to be an aid to\nmathematical research and not a substitute for it\u201d (Wang 1960).\nWith this in mind, and while the automated reasoning community\ncontinues to try to meet the grand challenge of building increasingly\npowerful theorem provers, mathematicians can draw now some of the\nbenefits offered by current systems, including assistance in\ncompleting proof gaps or formalizing and checking the correctness of\nproposed proofs. Indeed, the latter may be an application that could\nhelp address some real issues currently being faced by the\nmathematical community. Consider the announcement by Daniel Goldston\nand Cem Yildrim of a proof of the Twin Prime Conjecture where,\nalthough experts initially agreed that the proof was correct, an\ninsurmountable error was found shortly after. Or, think about the case\nof Hales\u2019 proof of the Kepler Conjecture which asserts that no packing\nof congruent balls in Euclidean 3-space has density greater than the\nface-centered cubic packing. Hales\u2019 proof consists of about 300 pages\nof text and a large number of computer calculations. After four years\nof hard work, the 12-person panel assigned by Annals of\nMathematics to the task of verifying the proof still had genuine\ndoubts about its correctness. Thomas Hales, for one, took upon himself\nto formalize his proof and have it checked by an automated proof\nassistant with the aim of convincing others of its correctness (Hales\n2005b, in Other Internet Resources). His task was admittedly heavy but\nthe outcome is potentially very significant to both the mathematical\nand automated reasoning communities. All eyes were on Hales and his\nformal proof as he announced the completion of the Flyspeck\nproject (Hales 2014, in Other Internet Resources; Hales 2015) having\nconstructed a formal proof of the conjecture using the Isabelle and\nHOL Light automated proof assistants: \u201cIn truth, my motivations\nfor the project are far more complex than a simple hope of removing\nresidual doubt from the minds of few referees. Indeed, I see formal\nmethods as fundamental to the long-term growth of mathematics.\u201d\n(Hales 2006).\n\nChurch 1936a, 1936b and Turing 1936 imply the existence of\ntheorems whose shortest proof is very large, and the proof of the Four\nColor Theorem in (Appel & Haken 1977), the Classification of Simple\nGroups in (Gorenstein 1982), and the proof of the Kepler Conjecture in\n(Hales 2005a) may well be just samples of what is yet to come. As\n(Bundy 2011) puts it: \u201cAs important theorems requiring larger\nand larger proofs emerge, mathematics faces a dilemma: either these\ntheorems must be ignored or computers must be used to assist with\ntheir proofs.\u201d\n\nThe above remarks also counter another argument given for not using\nautomated theorem provers: Mathematicians enjoy proving theorems, so\nwhy let machines take away the fun? The answer to this is, of course,\nthat mathematicians can have even more fun by letting the machine do\nthe more tedious and menial tasks: \u201cIt is unworthy of excellent\nmen to lose hours like slaves in the labour of calculation which could\nsafely be relegated to anyone else if machines were used\u201d (G. W.\nLeibniz, New Essays Concerning Human Understanding). If still\nnot convinced, just consider the sobering prospect of having to\nmanually check the 23,000 inequalities used in Hales\u2019 proof!\n\nAnother reason that is given for the weak acceptance of automated\nreasoning by the mathematical community is that the programs are not\nto be trusted since they may contain bugs\u2014software\ndefects\u2014and hence may produce erroneous results. Formally\nverifying automated reasoning programs will help ameliorate this,\nparticularly in the case of proof checkers. Proving programs correct\nis no easy task but the same is true about proving theorems in\nadvanced mathematics: Gonthier proved correct the programs used in the\nformalization of his proof of the Four Color Theorem, but he spent far\nmore effort formalizing all the graph theory that was part of the\nproof. So ironically enough, it turns out that at least in this case,\nand surely there are others, \u201cit is actually easier to verify\nthe correctness of the program than to verify the correctness of the\npen-and-paper mathematics\u201d (Wiedijk 2006). For theorem provers\nand model finders, a complementary strategy would be to verify the\nprograms\u2019 results as opposed to the programs themselves. Paraphrasing\n(Slaney 1994): It does not matter to the mathematician how many\ndefects a program may have as long as the proof (or model) it outputs\nis correct. So, the onus is in the verification of results, whether\nproduced by machine or man, and checking them by independent parties\n(where of course the effort may well use automated checkers) should\nincrease the confidence on the validity of the proofs. \n\nIt is often argued that automated proofs are too long and detailed.\nThat a proof can be expressed in more elementary steps is in principle\nvery beneficial since this allows a mathematician to request a proof\nassistant justify its steps in terms of simpler ones. But proof\nassistants should also allow the opposite, namely to abstract detail\nand present results and their justifications using the higher-level\nconcepts, language, and notation mathematicians are accustomed to.\nExploiting the hierarchical structure of proofs as done in (Denney\n2006) is a step in this direction but more work along these lines is\nneeded. Having the proof assistant work at the desired level of\ngranularity provides more opportunity for insight during the proof\ndiscovery process. This is an important consideration since\nmathematicians are equally interested in gaining understanding from\ntheir proofs as in establishing facts. \n\n(Bundy 2011) alludes to a deadlock that is preventing the wider\nadoption of theorem provers by the mathematical community: On the one\nhand, the mathematicians need to use the proof assistants to build a\nlarge formal library of mathematical results. But, on the other hand,\nthey do not want to use the provers since there is no such library of\npreviously proved results they can build upon. To break the impasse, a\nnumber of applications are proposed of which assisting the\nmathematician in the search of previously proved theorems is of\nparticular promise. During its history, mathematics has accumulated a\nhuge number of theorems and the number of mathematical results\ncontinues to grow dramatically. In 2010, Zentralblatt MATH\ncovered about 120,000 new publications (Wegner 2011). Clearly, no\nindividual researcher can be acquainted with all this mathematical\nknowledge and it will be increasingly difficult to cope with one\u2019s\never-growing area of specialty unless assisted with automated\ntheorem-proving tools that can search in intelligent ways for\npreviously proved results of interest. An alternative approach to this\nproblem is for mathematicians to tap into each other\u2019s knowledge as\nenabled in computational social systems like polymath and\nmathoverflow. The integration of automated reasoning tools\ninto such social systems would increase the effectiveness of their\ncollective intelligence by supporting \u201cthe combination of\nprecise formal deductions and the more informal loose interaction seen\nin mathematical practice\u201d (Martin & Pease 2013, in Other\nInternet Resources). \n\nDue to real pressing needs from industry, some applications of\nautomated reasoning in pure and applied mathematics are more of\nnecessity than choice. After having worked on the formalization of\nsome elementary real analysis to verify hardware-based floating point\ntrigonometric functions, (Harrison 2006, Harrison 2000) mentions the\nfurther need to formalize more pure mathematics\u2014italics\nare his\u2014to extend his formalization to power series for\ntrigonometric functions and basic theorems about Diophantine\napproximations. Harrison finds it surprising that \u201csuch\nextensive mathematical developments are used simply to verify that a\nfloating point tangent function satisfies a certain error bound\u201d\nand, from this remark, one would expect there are other industrial\napplications that will demand more extensive formalizations.\n\nAlbeit not at the rate originally anticipated, automated reasoning is\nfinding applications in mathematics. Of these, formal verification of\nproofs is of special significance since it not only provides a viable\nmechanism to check proofs that humans alone could not but it also has,\nas a side effect, the potential to redefine what it would take for a\nproof to be accepted as such. As the use of automated reasoning\nassistants becomes more widespread one can envision their use\nfollowing a certain methodical order: First, automated reasoning tools\nare used for theory exploration and discovery. Then, having identified\nsome target problem, the practitioner works interactively with an\nautomated assistant to find proofs and establish facts. Finally, an\nautomated proof checker is used to check the correctness of all final\nproofs prior to being submitted for publication and being made\navailable to the rest of the mathematical community via the creation\nof new entries in a repository of formalized mathematics. It is indeed\na matter of time before the application of automated proof assistants\nbecomes an everyday affair in the life of the mathematician; it is the\ngrand challenge of the automated reasoning community to make it happen\nsooner than later.\n",
