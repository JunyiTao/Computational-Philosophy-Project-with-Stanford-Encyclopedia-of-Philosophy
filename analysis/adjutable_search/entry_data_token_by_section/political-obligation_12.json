    "main_text": "Anarchist Challenges to Political Obligation || Against Philosophical Anarchism\n3.2 Against Philosophical Anarchism\n\nWhether a priori or a posteriori, the arguments of the philosophical\nanarchists pose a serious challenge to those who believe in a general\nobligation to obey the law. This challenge is made especially\ndifficult by the powerful objections that Simmons and other a\nposteriori anarchists have brought against the existing theories of\npolitical obligation. The most effective response, of course, would be\nto demonstrate that one\u2019s favored theory does not succumb to\nthese objections, and we shall briefly consider attempts to respond in\nthis fashion in \u00a74, below. Some general attempts to refute\nphilosophical anarchism ought to be noted first, however.\n\nSome of these attempts apply specifically to Wolff\u2019s a priori\nattack on political authority and obligation, and others apply to\nphilosophical anarchism in general. The arguments against Wolff\nusually concentrate on his conception of autonomy and its relation to\nauthority. In brief, Wolff\u2019s critics argue that he is wrong to\ninsist that moral autonomy is our \u201cprimary\u201d or\n\u201cfundamental obligation,\u201d for it \u201cis, in fact,\nhighly implausible to think that autonomy should invariably override\nall other values\u201d (Horton, p. 127). Moreover, there is no reason\nto accept Wolff\u2019s claim that autonomy and authority are\nnecessarily incompatible. Insofar as autonomy is a capacity, as Wolff\nsays, it will need to be developed before it can be exercised, and\nvarious kinds of authority \u2013 including political authority\n\u2013 will foster its development and make its continued exercise\npossible (Dagger 1997, pp. 66\u201368). Nor is it clear how Wolff can\nreject political authority without also rejecting promises and\ncontracts as illegitimate constraints on one\u2019s autonomy \u2013\na problem that leads even Simmons to declare Wolff\u2019s a priori\nanarchism a \u201cfailed attempt\u201d (2001, p. 111).\n\nIn the face of these problems, Matthew Noah Smith has recently tried\nto rescue the a priori skepticism of Wolff\u2019s theory by\nsubstituting the overriding importance of \u201cthe moral status of\nthe subject\u2019s self\u201d (2011, p. 2) for Wolff\u2019s\nreliance on the fundamental duty of autonomy. According to Smith,\npreserving the status of the self is incompatible with the law\u2019s\nclaim to authority, because \u201cthe obligation to obey the law\nwould morally require otherwise morally upstanding subjects to undergo\na radical form of self-effacement in favor of recreating themselves in\nthe image of foreign values\u201d (p. 2; see p. 9 for an admittedly\n\u201cflorid\u201d way of making this point). Whether the law is\nproperly understood as an \u201calien force\u201d that threatens\n\u201cto fix who one is\u201d (p. 14), however, is a point that\ncritics of a priori anarchism are not likely to concede. Indeed, the\nradically individualistic conception of the self that underpins\nSmith\u2019s argument is one that proponents of the membership or\nassociative theory of political obligation (see \u00a74.3, below) will\ndismiss from the outset. It seems unlikely, then, that Smith\u2019s\nadaptation will develop the \u201ctraction\u201d that, on his\naccount, Wolff\u2019s has failed to gain.\n\nWith regard to philosophical anarchism in general, critics have\nresponded in various ways, including the disparate complaints that it\nis a kind of false or hypocritical radicalism (Gans) and that it is\nall too genuine a threat to political order (Senor). The latter\ncomplaint has both an ontological and a conceptual aspect. That is,\nthe critics argue that philosophical anarchists fail to appreciate the\nsocial or embedded nature of human beings, which leads the anarchists\nto conceive of obligation in excessively individualistic or\nvoluntaristic terms \u2013 and that leads, in turn, to their denial\nof a general obligation to obey the law. The problem, however, is that\nit is a mistake to think \u201cthat political life can be left more\nor less unchanged by dispensing with some conception of political\nobligation and adopting the perspective of philosophical anarchism.\nUnless it can be shown that we can continue to talk intelligibly and\ncredibly of our government or our state, then a root\nand branch reimagining of our political relations would appear to be a\nnecessary consequence\u201d (Horton 2010, p. 133; emphasis in\noriginal). Whether the philosophical anarchists should welcome that\nconsequence, or whether they can find a way to stop short of it, thus\nbecomes a major point of contention.\n\nIn the end, of course, the best response to philosophical anarchists,\nespecially those of the a posteriori kind, will be to produce or\ndefend a theory of political obligation that proves immune to their\nobjections. At present, though, no single theory has the support of\nall of those who continue to believe in political obligation, let\nalone the clear prospect of converting philosophical anarchists.\nSeveral theories remain in contention, however, as the following\nsection indicates.\n",
