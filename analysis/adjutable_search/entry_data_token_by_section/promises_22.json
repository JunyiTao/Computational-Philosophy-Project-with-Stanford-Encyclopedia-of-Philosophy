From its ancient origins promissory theory has been\nintertwined with issues of contracts and agreements more generally.\nAnd since at least the time of Aquinas and especially with the works\nof the later Natural Lawyers like Grotius and Pufendorf, scholarly\nwork on promising has been done at least in part with an eye towards\ninforming the law of contract. This in turn gave rise to a tradition\non the part of legal theorists of surveying such scholarship in their\nwork on both historical and contemporary issues in the law of\ncontract. Finally, the law itself has methods for dealing with\npromises (as they are obviously the sorts of things that might lead to\nlegal wrangling). Thus the legal practice regarding promises has some\ninterest to theorists of promising as well. The result is two\ninterlinked scholarly traditions and bodies of work.\n\nPerhaps the first question on the mind of legal and philosophical\nhistorians is the issue of the degree to which, if any, contractual\nobligations are grounded in promissory obligations in contemporary\nlegal regimes. This question is complicated by the different\ntraditions and cultures involved in the long path to contemporary law,\ni.e., natural law theory, virtue theory, rights theory, the (anglo)\ncommon law, the continental civilian law, canon law and other\ntheoretical approaches, which are in turn variously situated in the\nUK, on the European continent, and in the anglo territories (Scotland,\nAustralia, Canada the US, etc.). The answer to the question is\ndifferent in different traditions and places, and the contemporary law\nis the result of some complicated amalgamation of these different\ntraditions over time. For an overview of these issues, see, e.g.,\nGordley (1991), Ibbetson (1999), Markovits (2011), Swain (2013), or\nFried (1981, 2015).\n\nOne central dialectic within this corpus has the \u201cnormative\npower\u201d tradition of the natural lawyers pitted against the more\nexpectational views of the English common law. As Atiyah notes (1981:\nch. 6), there is a tension between the Natural Law promissory theory\nand the actual law of contract and promise plainly evident in the\nBritish common law. One source of the tension is the common law\ndoctrine of \u201cconsideration\u201d, which mandates that only\npromises given with \u201cconsideration\u201d, i.e., given in\nexchange for something of value, are enforceable in the law. In other\nwords, mere promises, given without consideration, are traditionally\nnot indemnified by the law.\n\nFurther, as Lon Fuller and William Perdue pointed out in an\ninfluential 1936/37 article \u201cThe Reliance Interest in Contract\nDamages\u201d, the damages awarded by courts to those who have had a\npromise or contract broken is best understood as being proportional to\nthe harm the plaintiff suffered in relying on the promise. These and\nother considerations argue for a theory of promises based on\nexpectations and reliance, i.e., an expectational theory, as opposed\nto one based on conventions or natural duties, and this is what a\nnumber of philosophers and legal theorists have done. This debate has\nspawned a sizable literature (see Swain 2013 for a good overview of\nthis work).\n\nCharles Fried\u2019s widely influential book Contract as\nPromise (1981) re-kindled this debate in American legal circles.\nFried argued that the traditional approach, which made contractual\nobligation out to be grounded in promissory obligation, was slowly\nbeing usurped by the consequentialist-flavored approaches of the\nEnglish common law, and he aimed his book as a polemic against this\nmovement.\n\nFried took on these arguments directly, and the corpus of work that\nsprang from the book greatly enlarged the debate. In 2012 a special\nconference and subsequent issue of the Suffolk University Law Review\nrevisited Fried\u2019s work, 30 years on. This new corpus of work\nprovides us with some interesting new explorations. As an example of\nthis, see Brian Bix\u2019s assessment in his essay (2012). Subsequent\nto this Fried released an updated version of the book in 2015, which\nin turn has spawned a more recent literature (see Markovits 2020;\nSaprai 2013; Bix 2017; Encarnacion 2018)\n\nAnd the legal academy continues to work on the relation between the\nconcepts and the theoretical foundations of contract law, with\nscholars like Markovits (2011), Shiffrin (2006, 2012), Pratt (2007,\n2014) Encarnacion (2018), Saprai (2017) and many others contributing.\nFor an excellent overview of the theoretical work see the SEP entry on\n contract law.\n",
