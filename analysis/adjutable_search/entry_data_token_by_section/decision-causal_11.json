    "main_text": "Current Issues || Acts\n3.4 Acts\n\nIn deliberations, a first-person action proposition represents an act.\nThe proposition has a subject-predicate structure and refers directly\nto the agent, its subject, without the intermediary of a concept of\nthe agent. A centered world represents the proposition. Such a world\nnot only specifies individuals and their properties and relations, but\nalso specifies which individual is the agent and where and when his\ndecision problem arises. Realization of the act is realization of a\nworld with, at its center, the agent at the time and place of his\ndecision problem.\n\nIsaac Levi (2000) objects to any decision theory that attaches\nprobabilities to acts. He holds that deliberation crowds out\nprediction. While deliberating, an agent does not have beliefs or\ndegrees of belief about the act that she will perform. Levi holds that\nNewcomb\u2019s problem, and evidential and causal decision theories\nthat address it, involve mistaken assignments of probabilities to an\nagent\u2019s acts. He rejects both Jeffrey\u2019s ([1965] 1983)\nevidential decision theory and Joyce\u2019s (1999) causal decision\ntheory because they allow an agent to assign probabilities to her acts\nduring deliberation.\n\nIn opposition to Levi\u2019s views, Joyce (2002) argues that (1)\ncausal decision theory need not accommodate an agent\u2019s assigning\nprobabilities to her acts, but (2) a deliberating agent may\nlegitimately assign probabilities to her acts. Evidential decision\ntheory computes an act\u2019s expected utility using the probability\nof a state given the act, \\(P(S\\mid A)\\), defined as \\(P(S \\amp A)/P(A)\\).\nThe fraction\u2019s denominator assigns a probability to an act.\nCausal decision theory replaces \\(P(S\\mid A)\\) with \\(P(A \\gt S)\\) or a\nsimilar causal probability. It need not assign a probability to an\nact.\n\nMay an agent deliberating assign probabilities to her possible acts?\nYes, a deliberator may sensibly assign probabilities to any events,\nincluding her acts. Causal decision theory may accommodate such\nprobabilities by forgoing their measurement with betting quotients.\nAccording to that method of measurement, willingness to make bets\nindicates probabilities. Suppose that a person is willing to take\neither side of a bet in which the stake for the event is \\(x\\) and the\nstake against the event is \\(y\\). Then the probability the person\nassigns to the event is the betting quotient \\(x/(x + y)\\). This\nmethod of measurement may fail when the event is an agent\u2019s own\nfuture act. A bet on an act\u2019s realization may influence the\nact\u2019s probability, as a thermometer\u2019s temperature may\ninfluence the temperature of a liquid it measures.\n\nJoyce (2007: 552\u2013561) considers whether Newcomb problems are\ngenuine decision problems despite strong correlations between states\nand acts. He concludes that, yes, despite those correlations, an agent\nmay view her decision as causing her act. An agent\u2019s decision\nsupports a belief about her act independently of prior correlations\nbetween states and her act. According to a principle of evidential\nautonomy (2007: 557), \n\n\nA deliberating agent who regards herself as free need not proportion\nher beliefs about her own acts to the antecedent evidence that she has\nfor thinking that she will perform them. \n\n\nShe should proportion her beliefs to her total evidence, including her\nself-supporting beliefs about her own acts. Those beliefs provide new\nrelevant evidence about her acts.\n\nHow should an agent deliberating about an act understand the\nbackground for her act? She should not adopt a backtracking\nsupposition of her act. Standing on the edge of a cliff, she should\nnot suppose that if she were to jump, she would have a parachute to\nbreak her fall. Also, she should not imagine gratuitous changes in her\nbasic desires. She should not imagine that if she were to choose\nchocolate instead of vanilla, despite currently preferring vanilla,\nthat she would then prefer chocolate. She should imagine that her\nbasic desires are constant as she imagines the various acts she may\nperform, and, moreover, should adopt during deliberations the pretense\nthat her will generates her act independently of her basic desires and\naversions.\n\nChristopher Hitchcock (1996) holds that an agent should pretend that\nher act is free of causal influence. Doing this makes partitions of\nstates yielding probabilities for decision agree with partitions of\nstates yielding probabilities defining causal relevance. As a result,\nprobabilities in causal decision theory may form a foundation for\nprobabilities in the probabilistic theory of causation. Causal\ndecision theory, in particular, the version using dependency\nhypotheses, grounds theories of probabilistic causation.\n",
