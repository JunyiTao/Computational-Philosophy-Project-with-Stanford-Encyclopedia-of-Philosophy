    "main_text": "Objections to Impossible Worlds || Counterpossible Reasoning\n6.6 Compositionality\n\nCompositionality is the principle that the meaning or content\nof a complex expression is a function of the meanings of its\nconstituent expressions. It\u2019s commonly taken to be a mandatory\nfeature of any adequate theory of meaning and content. The argument is\nthat, as competent speakers of a language, we are in principle capable\nof grasping the meanings of a potentially infinite number of\nsentences. And since we\u2019ve learnt the meanings of a limited\nnumber of words, this is possible only if the meanings of complex\nsentences are obtainable recursively from the meanings of their\nconstituent parts (Davidson 1965).\n\nThe worry is that a theory of meaning or content which includes\nimpossible worlds will not be compositional. Consider what we said\nabove about the exportation principle (Section 6.1) and the semantics\nof negation (Section 6.4). An impossible world may represent that\n\\(\\neg A\\) independently of whether it represents that \\(A\\). But\nthen, for such worlds, the truth-value of \\(\\neg A\\) is not a function\nof the truth-value of \\(A\\). So, the worry goes, the content or\nproposition that \\(\\neg A\\), understood as a set of possible and\nimpossible worlds, will not be a function of the proposition that\n\\(A\\). Certainly, the latter is not the set-theoretic complement of\nthe former, as it is on the possible worlds account. The same goes for\nall the other logically complex sentences. This is perhaps the most\nserious objection to the impossible worlds approach. If it can\u2019t\nbe met, it may well be fatal.\n\nTo address the worry, defenders of impossible worlds must show that\ntheir notion of content is compositional, even if it does not provide\nuniform truth-conditions across all worlds. In other words, they must\nspecify a way to calculate complex contents from constituent contents,\nbut which does not go via the usual truth-at-a-world clauses for\nconnectives. As far as we know, the only attempt to achieve this is in\nBerto and Jago 2019, Chapter 8. They view contents as sets of\n(possible and impossible) worlds, which are themselves sets of\nsentences of some \u2018worldmaking\u2019 language. They argue that\ngrammatical structures can thus be recovered from semantic contents,\nvia the syntactic structure of the worldmaking sentences involved.\nThis provides a functional map between grammatical structure and\nsemantic content which in turn, they argue, provides a means for\ncalculating complex contents from their constituents. Whether this\nprovides an acceptable notion of compositionality (as they claim)\nremains to be seen.\n\nThe compositionally objection also appears in Williamson 2020, a book\nmostly devoted to a defense of the extensional material conditional as\ngiving the meaning of the indicative \u201cif\u201d, but also\ndealing with counterfactuals. Williamson accuses hyperintensional\napproaches to conditionals and to content in general \u2014 whether\nbased on impossible worlds, or of other kinds, e.g., based on\ntruthmakers \u2014 of \u201coverfitting\u201d: complicating the\nsemantics in order to account for the variability and systematic\ninconsistencies of speakers\u2019 judgments, with the result of\nincorporating \u201cnoise\u201d in their models. At the extreme of\nfine-graining, open impossible worlds approaches \u201cmust\nindividuate meanings so finely as to restrict synonymy to\nself-synonymy, and thereby render the conception of meaning\ntheoretically useless, because it filters nothing out\u201d\n(249).\n\nOf course, hyperintensionalists (with impossible worlds sympathies, or\nof other kind) may equally accuse extensional or merely intensional\nsemantics of \u201cunderfitting\u201d: conflating contents we may\nhave good reasons to keep distinct. We seem to need some principled\nway to mark the proper boundaries of semantics. Williamson proposes\none: we should pay more attention to a cognitive or epistemic level,\nintermediate between semantics and pragmatics. Many intuitive\ndistinctions hyperintensionalists try to force into the semantics are\nbetter explained as belonging to competent speakers\u2019\ncognitive-epistemic heuristics. He grants, for instance, that the view\nthat counterpossibles are not all trivially true speaks to our\nintuitions; but objects that \u201csometimes, the robustly shared\nverdicts of native speakers on a sample sentence will simply be false,\nthe predictable output of a fallible human heuristic.\u201d\n(265).\n\nSome authors, e.g. Rothschild (2021), argue that the Williamsonian\nstance is at odds with standard practice in semantics. The early\nchapters of any textbook introduction to semantics (e.g., Chierchia\nand McConnell-Ginet 1990; Heim and Kratzer 1997) tell us that one key\ntask of semantics is to account for (rather than explain away)\ncompetent speakers\u2019 intuitions and judgments of synonymy,\nantonymy, entailment, etc. Williamson\u2019s endorsement of the\nextensional material conditional gives, of course, a very simple\nsemantics for the indicative \u201cif\u201d; but, says Rothschild,\n\u201cthe simplicity comes at the cost of failing to integrate\nconditionals with the compositional semantics of natural\nlanguage\u201d (22). And once the heuristic procedures are developed\nin order to carry out the aforementioned key task, \u201cit is not\nclear that Williamson\u2019s overall system will still look\nsimple\u201d. (Ibid.)\n\nThe compositionally objection is also raised by Fine 2021, who\nproposes his truthmaker semantics as a hyperintensional account of\ncontent in place of possible and impossible worlds-based accounts.\nFine\u2019s semantics (2017a,b) uses states in place of\nworlds, where states are things that may fail to be maximal (making\nsome sentences neither true nor false), and they may be inconsistent.\nInconsistent states may be formed as mereological sums of consistent\nstates, e.g., summing the state in which the table is round with one\nin which it is square gives an impossible situation in which there is\na round square table. (To handle conjunction, Fine requires each set\nof states to have a mereological sum, so he is committed to\ninconsistent states like this.) Impossible worlds, too, may be\ninconsistent and incomplete. One live issue is thus whether truthmaker\nsemantics is a notational variant of a kind of impossible worlds\nsemantics, rather than an alternative to it. Ontologically, they seem\non a par and, in this sense, truthmaker semantics can be seen as a\nform of impossible worlds semantics. However, it is probably more\nappropriate to view truthmaker semantics as a rival to standard\nimpossible worlds accounts. Central to truthmaker semantics is the\nnotion of exact truthmaking, whereby the state in question is\nwholly relevant to the sentence\u2019s truth. Truthmaker semantics\nstakes its reputation on the utility of this notion, whereas standard\nimpossible worlds semantics does not.\n\nFine\u2019s approach is appealing with respect to the compositionally\nworry: it provides uniform clauses for the Boolean connectives at a\nstate, irrespective of whether the state is consistent. But the same\ncan be said of some impossible worlds semantics, e.g. the worlds\nsemantics for First Degree Entailment (FDE), a simple four-valued,\nparaconsistent logic (Dunn 1976, Belnap 1977a-b) which has been\nprovided with a worlds semantics including worlds where formulas can\nbe both true and false, or neither true nor false. But whether uniform\nclauses can be given for all operators is unclear. In Fine\u2019s\n2012 semantics for counterfactuals, for instance, counterfactuals may\nbe evaluated only with respect to possible worlds (which are, in\neffect, maximal possible states), with the consequence that embedded\ncounterfactuals are not permitted. It is currently unclear whether\nevaluation of counterfactuals at impossible states would require\nnon-uniform clauses.\n\nAnother compositionally-based worry concerns negation: are the\nnegations of equivalent sentences themselves equivalent? This will not\nbe the case in general within impossible worlds semantics. The\nsituation with truthmaker semantics is not straightforward: it holds\nin some but not all systems (e.g. not in Fine and Jago 2019).\nFine\u2019s response is not to banish those weaker systems, but to\nprefer certain systems for certain purposes. That response is also\nopen to friends of impossible worlds.\n\nUndoubtedly, other objections to impossible worlds can and are likely\nto be raised. The current debate on impossible worlds appears to be at\nthe same stage as the one on possible worlds was, some forty\nyears ago. At that time, people struggled to make sense of the concept\nof a possible world. Many declared it meaningless. Nowadays, the\nvariety of its applications has placed the notion firmly at the core\nof much philosophical and logical practice (see e.g., Divers 2002,\nChapter 4). Impossible worlds may undergo the same fate, should they\nprove as useful as they appear to be in the treatment of\nimpossibilities of various kinds.\n",
