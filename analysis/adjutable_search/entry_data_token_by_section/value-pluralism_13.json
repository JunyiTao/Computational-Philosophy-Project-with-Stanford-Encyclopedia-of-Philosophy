    "main_text": "Pluralism and Rational Choice || Super Scales\n4.2 Super Scales\n\nOne direction that pluralists have taken is to argue that although\nvalues are plural, there is nonetheless an available scale on which to\nrank them. This scale is not rationalized by something that the values\nhave in common (that would be monism), but by something over and above\nthe values, which is not itself a super value. Williams sometimes\nwrites as if this is his intention, as do Griffin (1986 and 1997),\nStocker (1990), Chang (1997 and 2004), Taylor (1982 and 1997). James\nGriffin (1986) develops this suggestion in his discussion of plural\nprudential values. According to Griffin, we do not need to have a\nsuper-value to have super-scale. Griffin says:\n\n\u2026it does not follow from there being no super-value that there\nis no super-scale. To think so would be to misunderstand how the\nnotion of \u2018quantity\u2019 of well-being enters. It enters\nthrough ranking; quantitative differences are defined on qualitative\nones. The quantity we are talking about is \u2018prudential\nvalue\u2019 defined on informed rankings. All that we need for the\nall-encompassing-scale is the possibility of ranking items on the\nbasis of their nature. And we can, in fact, rank them in that way. We\ncan work out trade-offs between different dimensions of pleasure or\nhappiness. And when we do, we rank in a strong sense: not just choose\none rather than the other, but regard it as worth more. That is the\nultimate scale here: worth to one\u2019s life. (Griffin 1986, p. 90)\n\n\nThis passage is slightly hard to interpret (for more on why see my\nearlier discussion of Griffin in the section on preference\nsatisfaction accounts). On one interpretation, Griffin is in fact\nespousing a sophisticated monism. The basic value is \u2018worth to\none\u2019s life\u2019, and though it is important to talk about\nnon-basic values, such as the different dimensions of pleasure and\nhappiness, they are ultimately judged in terms of their contribution\nto the worth of lives.\n\nThe second possible interpretation takes Griffin\u2019s claim that\nworth to life is not a supervalue seriously. On this interpretation,\nit is hard to see what worth to life is, if not a supervalue. Perhaps\nit is only a value that we should resort to when faced with\nincomparabilities. However, this interpretation invites the criticism\nthat Griffin is introducing a non-moral value, perhaps prudential\nvalue, to arbitrate when moral values are incommensurable. In other\nwords, we cannot decide between incommensurable values on moral\ngrounds, so we should decide on prudential grounds. This seems\nreasonable when applied to incommensurabilities in aesthetic values.\nOne might not be able to say whether Guernica is better than War and\nPeace, but one might choose to have Guernica displayed on the wall\nbecause it will impress one\u2019s friends, or because it is worth\nmore money, or even because one just enjoys it more. In the case of\nmoral choices this is a less convincing strategy: it introduces a\nlevel of frivolity into morality that seems out of place.\n\nStocker\u2019s main strategy is to argue that values are plural, and\ncomparisons are made, so it must be possible to make rational\ncomparisons. He suggests that a \u201chigher level synthesizing\ncategory\u201d can explain how comparisons are made (1990, p. 172).\nAccording to Stocker these comparisons are not quantitative, they are\nevaluative:\n\nSuppose we are trying to choose between lying on a beach and\ndiscussing philosophy\u2014or more particularly, between the pleasure\nof the former and the gain in understanding from the latter. To\ncompare them we may invoke what might be called a higher-level\nsynthesizing category. So, we may ask which will conduce to a more\npleasing day, or to a day that is better spent. Once we have fixed\nupon the higher synthesizing category, we can often easily ask which\noption is better in regard to that category and judge which to choose\non the basis of that. Even if it seems a mystery how we might\n\u2018directly\u2019 compare lying on the beach and discussing\nphilosophy, it is a commonplace that we do compare them, e.g. in\nregard to their contribution to a pleasing day. (Stocker 1990, p. 72)\n\n\nStocker claims that goodness is just the highest level synthesizing\ncategory, and that lower goods are constitutive means to the good.\nRuth Chang\u2019s approach to comparisons of plural values is very\nsimilar (Chang 1997 (introduction) and 2004). Chang claims that\ncomparisons can only be made in terms of a covering value\u2014a more\ncomprehensive value that has the plural values as parts.\n\nA recent suggestion by Brian Hedden and Daniel Munoz is that by\ndefinition, overall value supervenes on the dimensions of value\n(Hedden and Munoz 2023). The basic point is that if overall value is\naffected, then there must be a relevant and distinct way that goodness\nor badness has been contributed. So, for example, in Chang\u2019s\ncase of adding more pleasure disrupting balance (see section 2.1),\nHedden and Munoz argue that balance is a dimension of value, and it is\nbecause balance has been adversely affected that there is less value\noverall.\n\nThere is a problem in understanding quite what a \u2018synthesizing\ncategory\u2019 or \u2018covering value\u2019 is. How does the\ncovering value determine the relative weightings of the constituent\nvalues? One possibility is that it does it by pure\nstipulation\u2014as a martini just is a certain proportion of gin and\nvermouth. However, stipulation does not have the right sort of\nexplanatory power. On the other hand, if a view is to remain\npluralist, it must avoid conflating the super scale with a super\nvalue. Chang argues that her covering values are sufficiently unitary\nto provide a basis for comparison, and yet preserve the separateness\nof the other values. Chang\u2019s argument goes as follows: the\nvalues at stake in a situation (for example, prudence and morality)\ncannot on their own determine how heavily they weigh in a particular\nchoice situation\u2014the values weigh differently depending on the\ncircumstances of the choice. However, the values plus the\ncircumstances cannot determine relevant weightings\neither\u2014because (simplifying here) the internal circumstances of\nthe choice will affect the weighting of the values differently\ndepending on the external circumstances. To use Chang\u2019s own\nexample, when the values at stake are prudence and morality\n(specifically, the duty to help an innocent victim), and the\ncircumstances include the fact that the victim is far away, the effect\nthis circumstance will have on the weighting of the values depends on\nexternal circumstances, which fix what matters in the choice. So, as\nChang puts it, \u201c\u2018What matters\u2019 must therefore have\ncontent beyond the values and the circumstances of the choice\u201d\n(2004, p. 134).\n\nStocker is aware of the worry that appeal to something in terms of\nwhich comparisons can be made reduces the view to monism: Stocker\ninsists that the synthesizing category (such as a good life) is not a\nunitary value\u2014it is at most \u2018nominal monism\u2019 in my\nterminology. Stocker argues that it is a philosophical prejudice to\nthink that rational judgment must be quantitative, and so he claims\nthat he does not need to give an account of how we form and use the\nhigher level synthesizing categories.\n",
