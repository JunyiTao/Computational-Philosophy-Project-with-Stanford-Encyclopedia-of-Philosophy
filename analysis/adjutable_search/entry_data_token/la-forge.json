Life and Works\n\nLa Forge was born on 24 or 26 November 1632 in La Fl\u00e8che, in\nthe Loire valley in central France, the same town in which Descartes\nhad attended college between 1607 and 1615. He became a medical doctor,\nand then moved to Saumur, where he married Ren\u00e9e Bizard in 1653.\nHe practised medicine at Saumur until his premature death in 1666.\nThere had been a Huguenot college at Saumur since 1599, when it was\nfounded by Philippe Duplessis-Mornay (1549\u20131623). Mo\u00efse Amyraut (1596\u20131664) and\nRobert Chouet (1642\u20131731) were among the notable contemporary\nscholars who taught there. There was also an Oratorian school (the\nColl\u00e8ge royal des Catholiques) and an adjoining seminary\nin the same town, at Notre Dame des Ardilliers. A number of\nCatholic philosophers had studied in the latter, including Bernard Lamy\n(1640\u20131715) and, for a brief period, Nicolas Malebranche. Both\ncolleges were receptive to the \u2018new\u2019 philosophy of\nCartesianism and, apparently, their staff members enjoyed more amicable\nrelations than might have been expected from the history of the\nreligious traditions that they represented. Following revocation of the\nEdict of Nantes (1685), the Calvinist college was razed, while\nNotre Dame des Ardilliers survives as a school to this day.\n\nLa Forge became acquainted with Cartesianism when he studied at La\nFl\u00e8che, and he continued his interest while practicing medicine\nat Saumur, where he had opportunities to discuss philosophy with other\nsympathetic readers of Descartes at both the Oratorian school and at\nthe Reformed Academy, especially with Chouet. Although he lived in the\nprovinces, he corresponded with some leading Cartesians of the period,\nincluding G\u00e9raud de Cordemoy (1626\u201384), who published his\nown contribution to Cartesianism in the same year as La Forge (Cordemoy\n1666). When Claude Clerselier (1614\u201384) began to edit\nDescartes\u2019 works and prepare them for publication, he acquired\nmanuscript copies of two of his unpublished essays entitled\nTrait\u00e9 de l\u2019Homme and Description du Corps\nHumain, both of which have since been lost. The\nTrait\u00e9 was the second part of a book that Descartes had\nplanned to publish as Trait\u00e9 de la lumi\u00e8re.\nHowever, those plans were deferred indefinitely when news of\nGalileo\u2019s condemnation reached Holland in 1633 and, as a result,\nthe Trait\u00e9 de l\u2019Homme remained unpublished during\nits author\u2019s lifetime. Nonetheless, Descartes retained the\nmanuscript throughout his peripatetic life; he also appears to have\nmade at least two copies for friends (Otegem, 2002: II, 485\u2013536),\nthrough whom in turn his physiological studies acquired a limited\ndissemination. In 1648, Descartes revisited his early work in\nphysiology; he reported that it was almost illegible, due to the\ncondition of the manuscript, and he began to draft a supplementary\nsketch of the conception and birth of animals in a manuscript entitled\nDescription du Corps Humain.\n\nBoth unpublished texts were still in poor condition when Descartes\ndied in 1650. Among other deficiencies, they lacked most of the\ndiagrams that were required to make his theory intelligible to readers, which Descartes had been unable to draw. Since\nClerselier was equally incapable of providing adequate illustrations,\nhe invited various people to prepare them. A number of those who\nunderstood Cartesian physiology (including Henricus Regius) refused to\ncooperate. Clerselier eventually identified two willing collaborators;\none was Louis de la Forge, in Saumur, and the other was Gerard van\nGutschoven (1615\u201368), a professor of anatomy in Louvain.\nClerselier accepted both offers of assistance and published their\nillustrations in the first edition. When the results of their artistic\nefforts coincided, he usually preferred those of Gutschoven because\nthey were better drawn; however, when they differed, he published both\nand used the letters \u2018F\u2019 and \u2018G\u2019 to identify\ntheir respective authors. La Forge was thus credited with seven\nof the published illustrations. Descartes\u2019 Trait\u00e9 de\nl\u2019Homme, with these illustrations and extensive notes by La\nForge, was published in Paris in April 1664. Thus La Forge\u2019s first publication was the lengthy set of notes that explain various\nfeatures of Descartes\u2019 Trait\u00e9, which appeared as\nRemarques on pp. 171\u2013408 of the first French edition of\nthat work. Meantime, Florentius Schuyl (1619\u00ad\u201369) had already\npublished independently a Latin translation of the manuscript of the\nTrait\u00e9 in 1662, under the title De Homine\n(Descartes 1662).\n\nWhile preparing his explanatory notes for the French edition of\nDescartes\u2019 Trait\u00e9 de l\u2019Homme, La Forge\nadverted to the opening sentences of that book, which referred to the\nhypothetical men described in it:\n\n\n These men will be composed, as\nwe are, of a soul and body. First I must describe the body on its own;\nthen the soul, again on its own; and finally I must show how these two\nnatures would have to be joined and united in order to constitute men\nwho resemble us. (CSM I, 98)\n\n\n Since Descartes died\nbefore he had completed even the first of these three stages, La Forge\ndecided to fill the lacuna by developing what he believed Descartes would have\nwritten about the human mind and its union with the body had he had\ntime to complete his theory, and he did so by borrowing extensively from\nDescartes\u2019 published and unpublished work. The result was the Trait\u00e9 de\nl\u2019Esprit de l\u2019Homme, which was composed contemporaneously with La Forge\u2019s commentary on Descartes\u2019 Trait\u00e9\nde l\u2019Homme, and in which he referred on numerous occasions\nto a work in progress on the human mind (H 172, 262, 299, 315,\n334, 335). This treatise was printed in Paris in November\n1665, although the publication date on the title page was 1666.\n\nThere is no official record of La Forge\u2019s death. However,\nClerselier confirmed in the preface to the third volume of\nDescartes\u2019 correspondence (which was printed in September 1666)\nthat La Forge had died soon after publishing his Trait\u00e9 de\nl\u2019Esprit de l\u2019Homme (Clerselier 1667: Preface\n\u00e32). It seems likely that he died sometime in early 1666, at the\nage of thirty-three.\n2. Explanation\n\nLa Forge endorsed fully Descartes\u2019 critique of the use of\nfaculties or powers in scholastic explanations. He reported that, for\nexample, many physicians attributed the beating of the heart to a\npulsific faculty of the soul, and added: \n\n\none cannot deny that\nthe heart has a faculty of beating since it does indeed beat \u2026\nhowever, here and in many other places this word [faculty] is useless\nand does nothing to explain how the thing occurs. (H\n183) \n\n\nLikewise he asked: \n\n\ndoes one really explain the cause of\ndiarrhoea, for example, by saying that it results either from the fact\nthat the expulsive faculty of the intestines is irritated or that their\nretentive faculty is weak? Is that not the same as saying, in good\nFrench, that I know nothing about it? (H 217) \n\n\nHe\nargued that all appeals to faculties and powers were nothing more than\nre-descriptions of the phenomena that need to be explained.\n\nIn physiology, La Forge supported an alternative Cartesian model of\nexplanation in terms of parts of matter in motion which, when linked\ntogether by contact action, form a machine.\n\n By the word\n\u201cmachine\u201d one cannot understand anything other than a body\ncomposed of many organic parts, which, united together, combine to\nproduce some movements that they would be incapable of producing if\nthey were separated. (H 173)\n\n This concept of a machine\napplies\n\n not only to watches or other automata \u2026 but to\nthe human body and that of all animals, and even the whole universe\ncould be considered a machine. (H 173)\n\n Accordingly, the\ndisciples of Descartes\n\n try to explain everything that occurs in\nan animal in the same way as the movements of an automaton occur.\n(H 335)\n\n The same principle had been identified by critics of\nCartesianism as one of its major defects rather than one of its\nstrengths.\n\nAssuming that the motions and interactions of parts of matter are\nsufficient to explain the human body, La Forge acknowledges that the explanatory \nenterprise must be hypothetical, and that hypotheses cannot be\nrestricted to what is visible to the naked eye.\n\n We would be very\nignorant if we had to doubt everything that we do not see \u2026 one\nsurely sees that the Sun and the Moon are sometimes in the East\n\u2026 and sometimes in the West, but one has never seen them move\nthere; nevertheless almost no one doubts their movement.\n(H 217)\n\n For similar reasons, one should not reject\nDescartes\u2019 assumptions about parts of matter in motion in the\nhuman body (such as animal spirits or the nerves) simply because, given\ntheir size, they are unobservable. Although Descartes and La Forge were\nattempting to describe parts of the human body and their motions before\nthe invention of the microscope, the methodological issue involved\nwould not have changed even if the threshold of observability had been\nmodified by optical instruments: the Cartesian theory of explanation\nsupported the postulation of unobservable particles of matter to\nexplain visible effects whenever they were thought necessary. Their\nexplanatory role justified their hypothetical postulation.\n\nThis required La Forge to address the topical question about how, and\nthe extent to which, explanatory hypotheses may be confirmed. He\noffered the same solution that was supported by other natural\nphilosophers in the seventeenth century, such as Robert Boyle or\nChristiaan Huygens:\n\n\nHowever, hypotheses are not only probable but also indubitable when\nthey explain something very clearly and easily, when our senses do not\ncontradict them, when reason shows that the phenomenon in question\ncould not occur otherwise and it is deduced from principles that are\ncertain, and when the hypotheses serve not only to explain one single\neffect but many different and even distinct effects; for it would be\nimpossible for hypotheses not to be found defective in some situation\nif they were not true. (H 218)\n\n\nAlthough he exaggerated the degree of certainty that could be\nlegitimately claimed for his hypotheses, La Forge did not claim\nexplicitly that all explanations must be mechanical. He is best\nunderstood as contrasting the emptiness of scholastic explanations,\nwhich were certain but non-explanatory, with the epistemic risks\ninvolved in postulating hypotheses that were at least intelligible\n(since they involved only pieces of matter in motion) and were\nconfirmed indirectly by their explanatory success. The limited choices\navailable among physiological explanations at that time\n(either scholastic faculties, or matter in motion) did not imply any\nconclusion about how the discipline could develop at a later time.\n3. Substance Dualism\n\nLa Forge was among the first commentators to attribute to Descartes\nan unambiguous dualism of mind and body. He defined a substance as\n\u2018a thing in which some property, quality or attribute (of which\nwe have a real idea in ourselves) resides immediately as in a subject\nand by which it exists\u2019 (H preface \u00f93). His\nRemarks were designed to extend the explanatory scope of the\nmachine model of the body to include all the actions of non-human\nanimals and, in the case of the human body, to explain how ideas arise\nin the brain, how they are stored in memory, and how they are\nre-activated in the imagination. Accordingly, he initially used the\nword \u2018idea\u2019, as Descartes had done, to refer to the\nbrain-states that are associated with the occurrence of thoughts in the\nmind (H 262), and he defined memory as the physical capacity\nof the brain to facilitate the repeated occurrence of such traces.\nSince the relevant brain-events were understood as patterns in the flow\nof animal spirits, memory was explained as an acquired disposition of\nthe paths through which animal spirits flowed to re-open on subsequent\noccasions when appropriately stimulated (Sutton 1998).\n\n Memory,\nwhich consists in nothing else, when considered from the perspective of\nthe body, than the facility which remains in the pores [of the brain]\nwhich had been opened previously to re-open subsequently.\n(H 304; cf. T 280\u201381: THM 178)\n\n\nThis Cartesian use of the term \u2018idea\u2019 was ambiguous,\nsince it referred to thoughts in the mind and the brain-states that\naccompany them. For that reason, La Forge decided in the\nTreatise to restrict the use of the term to thoughts, and to\nrename physical ideas in the brain as \u2018corporeal species\u2019\n(T 158, 256; THM 77, 159).\n\nAccording to this theory, the delicate fluid material called\n\u2018animal spirits\u2019 functions in a quasi-hydraulic machine\n(T 279; THM 177). Impressions on the external senses\nare transmitted to the \u2018common sense\u2019 in the brain, and the\npatterns in which animal spirits emerge from the brain in response to\nexternal stimuli are corporeal species. All voluntary or involuntary\nbodily actions, such as walking or blinking, are explained by the\nmotion of animal spirits from the brain to the muscles, while internal\nsensations (such as hunger or thirst) are likewise experienced by the\nsubject as a result of associated motions of animal spirits in the\nopposite direction, from other parts of the body to the brain. Even the\npassions or emotions are triggered by similar mechanisms. Thus\neverything that occurs in a human body may be explained by the motion\nof various kinds of matter in its various parts (e.g., the brain,\nnervous system, or the veins and arteries). The only exception in human\nnature to this type of physiological explanation, i.e., thought, was\nreserved exclusively to the mind.\n\nLa Forge began the Trait\u00e9 (1666) with a lengthy\npreface in which he compared Descartes\u2019 theory of the human mind with\nthat of Augustine, from whom he quoted extensively to show\nthat the mind is a distinct substance that is immaterial and survives\nthe death of the body. This immaterial substance has two characteristic\nproperties, by which alone it is known: understanding and willing. The\nunderstanding can generate ideas or conceptions of realities that have\nnever been observed or imagined, and to that extent it is independent\nof the human body. Pure understanding \u2018is a faculty which is\nindependent of the body in the same way as the will is\u2019\n(T 292; THM 188).\n\nThus ideas originate in the mind in two distinct ways: in one case,\nthey are triggered by sensations, and in the other they arise without\nany corresponding bodily stimulus. However, La Forge also repeated\nDescartes\u2019 theory of the origin of ideas, according to which all\nideas are innate (in some sense) in the mind. He identified the \u2018principal and effective\u2019 cause of ideas as the mind, while bodily\nsensations were described as the \u2018remote and occasional\u2019 causes of some ideas. The\nargument here seemed to depend on the dissimilarity between the body and\nthe mind:\n\n\nAlthough one could say that the bodies that surround our bodies\n\u2026 are in some sense the cause of the ideas we then have \u2026\nbecause these are material substances, the action of which does not\nextend to the soul insofar as it is simply a thing which thinks\n\u2026 they cannot be more than their remote and occasional causes\nwhich, by the union of mind and body, cause our faculty to think and\ndetermines it to produce ideas of which the faculty of thinking itself\nis the principal and effective cause. (T 176; THM\n92)\n\n\nThe mind is thus an active cause of all its own ideas, including\nthose that it generates on the occasion of being stimulated by the\nsenses. In that sense, all ideas are innate because the mind is their\nprincipal and effective cause.\n\nThe will is equally active; it is an\n\n active power \u2026 of\nchoosing or determining ourselves from within ourselves to everything\nto which we determine ourselves. (T 182; THM\n97)\n\n La Forge argued that, in addition to understanding and willing,\nthe human mind must have an intellectual memory; since it can reason\nabout purely spiritual realities, and since reasoning involves moving\nfrom one step to another and remembering those on which one relies for\nprogress, the human mind must be capable of remembering purely\nspiritual concepts of which it has had no corresponding corporeal\nspecies (T 291; THM 187). La Forge concludes in\nChapter xxv that the human mind is immortal; since its essence is to\nthink, the mind continues to think constantly for eternity and may also\nremember things that do not presuppose the presence of a body.\n\nThe stark definition of the human mind and body as distinct, simple\nsubstances did not prevent La Forge from describing their union in\nhuman nature as a \u2018composite subject\u2019 (T 112;\nTHM 39) and as \u2018a unity of composition and\nassociation\u2019 (T 98; THM 28). It is known from\nexperience that there is some kind of union involved here, which\nDescartes had struggled to describe in terms of an intermingling of two\nsubstances. La Forge describes it more analytically in causal terms; it\nconsists in\n\n a mutual and reciprocal dependence of thoughts of\none of them on the movements of the other, and in the mutual\ninteraction of their actions and passions. (T 210;\nTHM 122)\n\n\nLa Forge frequently describes this interaction in causal terms,\napparently without qualification or reservation. Accordingly, external\nbodies that interact with our sensory organs \u2018cause\u2019\nsensations in us; the motions of external stimuli are the \u2018true\ncauses\u2019 of our sensory perceptions (T 165, 326;\nTHM 83, 215). The interaction of mind and body is reciprocal,\n\n\nfor not only can the body stimulate (exciter) various\nthoughts in the mind, but the mind can also cause (causer)\nvarious movements in the body. (T 215; THM\n126)\n\n In general, the link between the human mind and body\n\n must\nconsist in the relation or concurrence of the actions and passions of\nthe mind and body. (T 212; THM 124)\n\n\nCritics of substance dualism claimed, or assumed without argument,\nthat it concealed an explanatory gap, since it failed to explain how\ntwo substances that were so dissimilar could interact causally with\neach other. La Forge addressed that issue in Chapter XVI of the\nTrait\u00e9.\n4. Occasionalism\n\n\nLa Forge is one of the first Cartesians (together with Cordemoy and\nGeulincx) who openly defends occasionalism. La Forge\u2019s\noccasionalism, however, is distinctive for both its scope and the\narguments it uses. La Forge\u2019s occasionalism is restricted to the\ndomain of physical interactions among bodies and allows for the causal\nactivity of finite minds. In this sense, La Forge (unlike Cordemoy,\nGeunlincx and Malebranche) is an advocate of \u201cpartial\noccasionalism\u201d (Radner 1993, Sangiacomo 2014). In order to\nestablish this form of partial occasionalism, La Forge builds his case\naround a specific issue in Cartesian physics, namely, the\n(im)possibility of any transfer of motion between interacting bodies.\nHis \u2018non-transfer\u2019 argument aims, in turn, to solve some\nambiguities in Descartes\u2019s own treatment and provide enough\nsupport for body-body occasionalism without undermining the causal\nefficacy of immaterial substances.\n\nTo fully understand La Forge\u2019s discussion, it is helpful to keep\nin mind the overall argumentative strategy that he tries to push. In\nthe THM, La Forge\u2019s main task is to show that there\nis mind-body interaction and that this is not so difficult to\nunderstand\u2014as many of Descartes\u2019s opponents have claimed.\nThe Cartesian account of mind-body interaction has been widely\ncriticized because of the radical heterogeneity of thinking and\nextended substances in Descartes\u2019s ontology. Elisabeth of\nBohemia, for instance, provides a paradigmatic expression of this\nconcern:\n\n\nI ask you please to tell me how the soul of a human being (it being\nonly a thinking substance) can determine the bodily spirits, in order\nto bring about voluntary actions. For it seems that all determination\nof movement happens through the impulsion of the thing moved, by the\nmanner in which it is pushed by that which moves it, or else by the\nparticular qualities and shape of the surface of the latter. Physical\ncontact is required for the fi rst two conditions, extension for the\nthird. You entirely exclude the one [extension] from the notion you\nhave of the soul, and the other [physical contact] appears to me\nincompatible with an immaterial thing. (AT iii.661; Shapiro 62)\n\n\nElisabeth\u2019s critique is truly Cartesian since it builds on the\ncriterion of clear and distinct intelligibility advocated by Descartes\nhimself. La Forge addresses this concern by denying that even\nhomogeneous or univocal causation (like body-body causation)\nis as intelligible as it looks. By showing that univocal causation\namong bodies is in fact impossible, La Forge aims to show that\nevery form of causation entails an interaction between\nsomething corporeal and something spiritual. Hence, the case of\nmind-body interaction ceases to be a puzzling scenario and becomes an\ninstance of a broader and more general account of causation.\n\n\nThis point is clearly stated at the beginning of Chapter 16 of La\nForge\u2019s THM:\n\nI think most people would not believe me if I said that it is no\nmore difficult to conceive how the human mind, without being extended,\ncan move the body and how the body without being a spiritual thing can\nact on the mind, than to conceive how a body has the power to move\nitself and to communicate its motion to another body. Yet there is\nnothing more true, and that is what I propose to show in this chapter.\n(THM 143)\n\n\nCritics think that body-body causation is easy to conceive while\nmind-body causation is hardly intelligible (especially in a Cartesian\ndualistic ontology). La Forge aims to reverse this impression by\nshowing that body-body causation is very hard to clearly and distinctly\nconceive and that, actually, it works in the same way as mind-body\ncausation.\n\n\nTo fully accomplish this task, La Forge has to disqualify the\npossibility of a purely body-body interaction and he has to prove that\nbodies are always moved by a non-bodily cause. To reach this\nconclusion, La Forge uses an argument by elimination which reviews\ndifferent potential sources of causal activity and shows that they do\nnot offer a satisfying account of causation. The argument identifies\nthree potential candidates as sources of causal activity in bodies: (i)\nother bodies; (ii) finite minds (e.g. human minds); and (iii) an\ninfinite mind (i.e. God). La Forge discusses all three options in turn\nin order to prove that neither (i) other bodies nor (ii) finite minds\ncan be the real causes of bodily movement in nature, and thus only God\ncan be their genuine cause.\n\n\nIn order to prove that a body can move neither another body nor\nitself, La Forge uses the \u2018non-transfer\u2019 argument.\n\nmotion is only a mode which is not distinct from the body to which\nit belongs and which can no more pass from one subject to another than\nthe other modes of matter, nor can it belong to a spiritual substance.\nBut the motive force, i.e. the force which transports a body from one\nvicinity to another and which applies it successively to different\nparts of the bodies which is leaves behind [\u2026], is not only\ndistinct from this application but also from the body which it applies\nand moves [\u2026]. Now if the force which moves is distinct from\nthe thing which is moved and if bodies alone can be moved, it follows\nclearly that no body can have the power of self-movement in\nitself. For if that were the case this force would not be\ndistinct from the body, because no attribute or property is distinct\nfrom the thing to which it belongs. If a body cannot move itself,\nit is obvious in my opinion that it cannot move another body. Therefore\nevery body which is motion must be pushed by something which is not\nitself a body and which is completely distinct from it. (THM\n145, emphasis added)\n\nBecause movement is only modally distinguished from the body, it\ncannot be separated from the moved body and it cannot be transferred\nfrom one body to another. However, because the force of movement can be\nseparated from a body, it should be really distinguished from the body.\nNow, because the force of movement is really distinguished from the\nmoved body, this force is not corporeal and does not pertain to such a\nbody. In the same way in which Descartes used the real distinction\nbetween thought and extension to prove that the nature of thought has\nnothing to do with extension, La Forge argues that the real distinction\nbetween movement and force of movement entails that the force of\nmovement cannot have anything extended in its own nature. Therefore, a\nbody cannot have the force to move itself and, thus, it cannot have the\nforce to move another body (because the force of motion is not in\nitself something bodily at all). \n\n\nThe reason to distinguish between movement and force of movement\nlies in the fact that movement is just a modification of the body and\nno modification can be transferred from a subject to another. On the\ncontrary, it is necessary to think that the same force of movement,\nwhich causes the motion of a body, applies differently to different\nbodies, and thus it must be really distinguished from them. It is\nimportant to note that if the force of movement is really distinct from\nanything extended, then it should not be conceived as properly\n\u2018divided\u2019. Divisibility is a property of extended things,\nand if the force of movement is not extended, then it cannot be\ndivisible in the way in which distances or bodies are. The\n(re)distribution of the force of movement across different bodies has\nthus to be understood more figuratively, perhaps analogously to the\nCartesian claim that the mind itself is equally present in the whole\nbody and in each of its parts.\n\nThe fact that the force of movement can be applied to different\nbodies appears as the crucial point in La Forge\u2019s argument.\nHowever, it might be asked why we should grant that the force is\nseparable from the body and can be transferred. In the end, what\nprevents us from claiming that even the force is a modification of the\nbody and thus cannot be separated from it? La Forge seems well aware of\nthis problem and proposes a reductio ad absurdum to support\nthis point:\n\nI may be told that I assume without argument that the force which\nmoves must be distinct from the thing which is moved. [\u2026] But\nlet us assume, if you wish, that this force is a mode of a body; it\ncould not then be distinguished from it and consequently it could not\npass from one body to another. If you conceive it in the same way\nas real qualities are conceived in the Schools and if you think it is\ndefinitely an accident of a body, even if it is distinct from it, then\nyou would have to conceive that it subdivides itself when one body\nmoves another and that it gives part of its movement to the other body\nand is therefore itself a body, at the same time as you assume that it\nis distinct from corporeal nature; for anything which is divisible and\nwhich has parts which can exist independently is a body; or you would\nhave to say that it does not subdivide but that the body in which it is\npresent produces a similar property in the body it touches when it\npushes it. You thereby give to bodies the power of creation.\n(THM 145\u2013146 emphasis added)\n\n\nUnder the hypothesis that the force of movement is a modification of\nthe body, the non-transfer argument prevents any transfer of such a\nforce from one body to another. However, La Forge assumes as factual\nthat impact implies a redistribution of quantity of motion. Provided\nthat the total amount of motion is conserved, this redistribution can\nbe explained by redistribution either of the movement itself or of the\nforce of movement. But if movement is a modification of the bodies, the\nnon-transfer argument prevents its transfer. Thus, it must be the force\nof movement that is redistributed among the colliding bodies. This\nimplies that the force of movement would be simultaneously\nnon-distinguished from bodies (which was the hypothesis) and\nactually distinguished from them (because of the fact that it is\nredistributed). Unfortunately, this conclusion leads to absurdities.\nIndeed, either the force of movement is something like a real quality,\nwhich La Forge considers a contradictory entity, or we should accept\nthat bodies have the power to create accidents in other bodies, which\nis taken as another absurdity. Thus, the force of movement cannot be a\nmodification of a body, and the hypothesis must be\nrejected.\n\n\nLa Forge presents his use of the non-transfer argument as nothing\nbut a faithful reading of Descartes. La Forge\u2019s discussion,\nhowever, is better seen as an emendation of Descartes\u2019s own\nposition, which was more ambiguous on this subject. In the discussion\nof the third law of nature in his Principles of Philosophy,\nDescartes licenses a language that seems to accept transfer of motion\nbetween bodies (Sangiacomo 2014). Henry More was puzzled by this and\npressed Descartes to clarify this point during their correspondence. In\nhis reply to More, Descartes denies that he ever allowed for any\ntransfer of motion.\n\n\nFrom a historical point of view, it is interesting to note that more\nor less during the same years in which La Forge works at his\nTHM, Margaret Cavendish (1623\u20131673) also discusses the\npossibility of deriving occasionalism from the\n\u2018non-transfer\u2019 argument (Cavendish 1664, letter 30: 97\u201398).\nCavendish may have been inspired by More\u2019s exchange with\nDescartes on this topic. However, she seems to ultimately reject\noccasionalism itself as understood and developed by La Forge and other\nCartesian occasionalists. La Forge, anyhow, quotes at length\nDescartes\u2019 answer to More, suggesting it as the true\ninterpretation of Descartes\u2019 physics.\n\n\nNonetheless, up to this point, La Forge has only proved that force\nof movement is not something corporeal. This implies that all physical\nmovements are always brought about by immaterial causes, which allows\nthat in some cases, immaterial substances like human minds can cause\nsome physical movements, i.e. voluntary motions, through the law of\ntheir union with the body. However, La Forge clearly would not assert\nthat finite immaterial substances, such as angels or intermediate kinds\nof beings, produce every physical movement. Therefore, La Forge still\nneeds a further argument to refute this kind of inference and show\nthat, generally speaking, God himself directly moves physical\nbodies.\n\n\nJust after the previous quote, La Forge introduces a further part of\nhis discussion in order to rule out the direct involvement of finite\nminds in natural phenomena. La Forge reminds us that movement produces\nevery difference we observe in the physical world. Thus, if God would\neliminate movement, the world would remain an inert mass of matter\nwhose parts would be indistinguishable. Accordingly, La Forge focuses\non the conditions in which God must introduce movement in such a mass\nto make a single body move.\n\n\n[1] I also claim that there is no creature, spiritual or corporeal,\nwhich can cause change in [matter] or in any of its parts, in the\nsecond moment of their creation, if the Creator does not do so himself.\nSince it was He who produced this part of matter in place A,\nfor example, not only must he continue to produce it if he wishes it to\ncontinue to exist but also, since he cannot create it everywhere or\nnowhere, he must put it in place B himself if he wishes it to\nbe there. For if he put it anywhere else there is no force capable\nof removing it from that location.\n\n[2] Let us even consider that if God gave this particular body\nA all the motive force which he uses at present to move the\nwhole of nature, it would not be enough even with all that to change\nits location, both because it would not be able to overcome the\nresistance of the rest of matter which we assume is at rest, and\nbecause in order to make body A capable of leaving its place\nto enter that of another body, the other body which it replaces would\nalso have to move at the same moment that body A begins to\nmove, since it is impossible for the first body to take the place of\nthe second unless, at the same time as it tries to do so, the second\nbody leaves that place and enters that of a third body and the third\nenters that of a fourth, and so on. That is how it could happen when\neverything is at rest. Therefore no matter what force God gives to\nbody A to move itself, it would be ineffective. That is why when\nGod decided to move matter in various ways he had to apply the force\nthat he chose to put into matter to many of its parts at the same time,\nso that they could give up their places to each other at the same\ninstant without which no motion could have been produced. (THM\n147, emphasis added. Numbers in brackets added to help discussion)\n\n\nScholars used to consider the appeal to continuous creation (point\n1) as an independent argument (Garber 1987, Nadler 2010: 123\u201341).\nHowever, this reading is difficult to maintain. Indeed, without the\nfurther development provided by the discussion at point 2, what is\nstated at point 1 remains unproved. Why should it be God\nhimself that has to recreate a moving body in a certain place?\nWhy is there no creature, spiritual or corporeal, which can\ncause change in the position of a body? As La Forge says, \u201cfor if\nhe put it anywhere else there is no force capable of removing it from\nthat location\u201d. But this is a mere assertion, which is proved\nonly at point 2. Evidently, if God has to recreate a body in\neach of its positions, then nothing can work against God\u2019s force.\nHowever, without establishing why God has to do so, the mere\nappeal to his continuous creation begs the question.\n\n\nRather, La Forge\u2019s argument suggests that he aims at proving\nwhy the nature of force is such that God has not only to\ncontinuously recreate a moving body but also must place that body in\neach of the different positions that the body undergoes throughout its\nmovement. The reason for this derives from the conditions of motion in\na plenum. La Forge\u2019s argument has two premises. First,\nthe force of rest of an indefinite mass of bodies at rest is even\ngreater than the infinite force of movement of just one single body.\nSecond, to allow just one single body to move, it is necessary that all\nother bodies move too. It follows that, in such a condition, even if a\nsingle body had an infinite force of movement, it would not move unless\nother bodies also moved. Hence, because in order to move a body from\none place to another it is necessary that all other bodies move, it\nfollows that the force that moves the body is the same that moves all\nthe other bodies, namely, the same force that introduces motion in\nmatter, i.e. God\u2019s force. Accordingly, the only force able to\nmove a body away from a certain position is the same force that\nsimultaneously moves all the other bodies, i.e. God\u2019s force.\nBecause motion is nothing but the passage from one position to another,\nGod himself not only recreates the moving body but recreates it in each\nof its positions.\n\n\nLa Forge introduces his reinterpretation of continuous creation to\ncomplement the non-transfer argument. La Forge\u2019s treatment of\nthis argument does not suggest any kind of generalization concerning\nthe way in which God\u2019s continuous creation should be conceived\nconcerning thinking substances. The reason why God has to recreate not\nonly bodies but also bodies in specific places, that is, bodies and\ntheir modifications, is grounded in the nature of bodies and in the\nconditions for a movement in a plenum. But a thinking substance neither\nmoves nor exists in a plenum. Therefore, God\u2019s modus\noperandi ought not be the same. This is the reason why La Forge\npresents these arguments exposed in Chapter 16 of his\nTrait\u00e9 as strong support for his interactionist account\nof mind-body union.\n\n\nHowever, by extending God\u2019s creative activity to the modes of\nbodies, La Forge seems to reduce the whole account to incoherence,\nbecause the same considerations would apply to human minds. God could\nnot create a human mind without its specific modes, which include all\nits thoughts and acts of the will. However, acts of the will as modes\nof a human mind are assumed by La Forge to be the basis on which human\nminds are genuinely active in determining themselves. If God creates\neven the acts of will of individual agents, it seems to undermine the\nclaim that they are self-determining when, according to\nLa Forge, they are determined by God\u2019s creative activity.\n\n\nTo address this concern, two considerations are in order. First, from a\nhistorical point of view, it is crucial to keep in mind that the\naccount of Divine concurrence was defended by Scholastic authors (from\nAquinas to Su\u00e1rez) as an antidote to (medieval)\noccasionalism and as a way of preserving the causal efficacy of\nsecondary causes without denying God\u2019s constant involvement in\nnature (e.g. Sangiacomo 2016). Despite appearances, thus, the claim\nthat God is directly involved in the operations of his creatures does\nnot entail by itself a commitment to the (stronger) claim that God is\nthe sole cause responsible for those operations. Second, from\na more theoretical point of view, in order to reach this stronger\nclaim, one needs to rule out the possibility that creatures make any\ngenuine causal contribution to the causal process. La Forge argues that\nthis is in fact the case for bodies, which (given how the physical\nworld works) cannot have any causal powers. However, this is not the\ncase for human minds, which (given how minds work) do have a genuine\nactive role to play in their operations.\n\n\nAs La Forge himself expressly points out:\n\nI would add to Mr. Descartes that although all things depend on God,\nas he says, they do so in different ways. For in the\nproduction of effects to which neither our own will nor that of any\nother free agent contributes, one could say that God consulted his own\nwill alone, by which he unconditionally determined to produce them in a\ncertain way and at a certain time; but in the case of effects to which\nour will contributes, God did not consider his own will alone but he\nalso included the consent of our will in his decree, and it was only\nafter having foreseen how our will would determine itself in such and\nsuch circumstances that he consequently willed absolutely that such\neffects would result. (THM 106\u2013107, emphasis added)\n\nHere, La Forge clearly aims at clarifying Descartes\u2019 account of\nwill rather than at contradicting it. Thus, he plainly acknowledges a\ndifference in God\u2019s modus operandi, due to the\ndifference between extended (inert) substances and spiritual (active)\nsubstances.\n\nAlthough La Forge concluded that \u2018God is the universal cause of\nall the motions which occur in the world\u2019, he also recognised\n\u2018bodies and minds as particular causes of these same motions\n\u2026 in determining and compelling the first cause to apply his\nforce and motive power to the bodies to which he would not otherwise\nhave applied it\u2019 in accordance with laws of nature that God\ndecreed (T 242: THM 148). He confirmed this view\nwhen he wrote, in relation to the reciprocal interaction of motions in\nthe human body and thoughts in the mind:\n\nOne should not say that it is God who does everything and that the\nbody and mind do not really act on each other. For if the body had not\nhad such a movement, the mind would never have had such a thought, and\nif the mind had not had such a thought the body might also never have\nhad such a movement.\n(T 245; THM 150)\n\nGod has arranged matters, in human nature, so that certain thoughts\nin the mind are accompanied by changes in the brain, and certain\nmotions of animal spirits trigger specific thoughts in the mind. God\u2019s\ncreative arrangement by which these twinned realities interact provides\nthe ultimate explanation (if it is such) of a familiar fact of our\nexperience. In that sense, the role of God in relation to mind-body\ninteraction is exactly similar to God\u2019s role in relation to body-body\ninteractions.\n\n\nFrom a historical point of view, La Forge\u2019s emphasis on the\nnon-transfer argument for occasionalism had some impact on later\ndebates, especially in the British arena. Antoine Le Grand (1629\u20131699),\noriginally from France, spent a large part of his life in England. He\nwas active in the second half of the seventeenth century as an author\nof important Cartesian textbooks, in which he shows sympathy for\noccasionalism and supports it by adopting La Forge\u2019s non-transfer\nargument. Arguably reacting against the success that occasionalism was\nenjoying, John Toland (1670\u20131722) would go on to call occasionalism\napplied to the physical realm a \u201cmonstrous hypothesis\u201d and\nreject it in his Letter to Serena (1704, letter V; see\nSangiacomo 2013) discussing again the same argument.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"LaForWor\">La Forge\u2019s Works</a>", "<a name=\"RelEarWor\">Related Early Works</a>", "<a name=\"SecLit\">Secondary Literature</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a name=\"LaForWor\">La Forge\u2019s Works</a>": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "[<em>H</em>] Clerselier, Claude (ed.), 1664,\n<em>L\u2019Homme de Ren\u00e9 Descartes et un Traitt\u00e9 de la\nFormation du Foetus du mesme autheur, Avec les Remarques de Louys de la\nForge, Docteur en Medicine, demeurant \u00e0 La Fleche, sur le\nTrait\u00e9 de Ren\u00e9 Descartes; &amp; sur les Figures par\nluy invent\u00e9es</em>, Paris: Charles Angot.", "La Forge, Louis de, 1666, <em>Traitt\u00e9 de l\u2019Esprit de\nl\u2019Homme, de ses facultez et fonctions, et de son union avec le\ncorps.
