    "main_text": "Physical Theory || Elements\n2.4 Elements\n\nThe four elements, fire, air, water, and earth, are also important\nentities to which the Stoics appeal in their physical theory. Sources\noffer contradicting evidence as to the relationship of the elements to\nother bodies and notably to the two principles. Unlike the passive\nprinciple, elements appear to have some qualities (fire, for example,\nis hot). Nonetheless, the elements also sometimes seem to constitute\nor make up the principles themselves. The active principle, for\nexample, is said to be made up of fire and air, while matter is\nsometimes said to be made up of water and earth (Nemesius, 47D). The\nactive principle is described as fiery (Galen, On the Habits of\nthe Soul, 4.783) and the tensility of pneuma is\nsometimes accounted for by the interaction of hot fire and cold air\nwhich rarefy and condense in turn, modifying the density of other\nelements.\n",
