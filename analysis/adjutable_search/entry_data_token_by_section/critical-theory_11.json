    "main_text": "Critical Methods || Disclosive Critique, Genealogy, and the Critique of Normativity\n2.4 Disclosive Critique, Genealogy, and the Critique of Normativity\n\nWhile these approaches seek to develop a socially grounded form of\nnormativity, critics argue that they are still too idealizing in their\nunderstanding of social reality and its historical genesis, as well as\ntoo normative in their methods from the point of view of yet another\nmodel of critique, which has been called disclosive or\ngenealogical.\n\nDisclosive critique typically takes its cue from Adorno (and sometimes\nother theoretical sources from Heidegger to contemporary aesthetics),\nmoving beyond the dichotomy between literary world-disclosure and\nphilosophical reason-giving or the quest for normative foundations. On\nthis view, critique has the task of revealing the world in a new and\ndifferent light, disclosing unrecognized suffering and intricate forms\nof domination that are not only occluded by dominant ideologies but\nalso shape the norms that emanate from that order in ways that escape\nmore strongly normative versions of immanent critique that build on\nthem. Dialectic of Enlightenment can be read as an exercise\nin disclosive critique that seeks to defamiliarize the social world\nfor its readers and thereby break open their unquestioned acceptance\nof how things appear to them (Honneth 1998).\n\nThis negative orientation of disclosive critique can be complemented\nby a more positive one, in which what is disclosed also involves\npotentialities and horizons that have no space or way to articulate\nthemselves within the existing social and normative order. Walter\nBenjamin\u2019s writings on the radical potential of mass culture or\nJudith Butler\u2019s Gender Trouble (1990) can be seen as\nexamples of disclosive critique that involve both the disruption of\nestablished and the experimental opening up of new experiences and\nschemas (Vogelmann 2016).\n\nSome critical theorists attempt to integrate a more positive idea of\ndisclosure into critical theory while maintaining that this is not at\nodds with expanded conceptions or normativity. Some draw on Heidegger\nto develop an account of world-disclosive critique that rethinks\nreason and agency, stressing receptivity and\n\u201cself-decentering\u201d as an alternative model to\nHabermas\u2019s focus on procedural reason (Kompridis 2006). Others\nstress that while disclosure can and must be subject to\nintersubjective validation through argumentation, critical theory must\nhave recourse to the disclosive power of imagination, which is\nrevealed in the force of exemplarity (Ferrara 2008), in focusing\nattention on the aesthetic dimension of narratives that social\nmovements use to imagine alternative possibilities (Lara 1998, 2021),\nor in the way that powerful representations of the good society\nfunction to disclose a transcendent object that cannot be fully known\nor represented but can nonetheless provide ethical orientation (Cooke\n2006). In a variety of different ways, these approaches attempt to\nmaintain the utopian dimension of critique (Marcuse 1937).\n\nGenealogical critique, by contrast, can be seen as a form of\ndisclosive critique that is more focused on problematizing, unmasking,\nand disrupting (Saar 2002, Koopman 2013). Given its association with\nNietzsche and Foucault, it also has a distinct trajectory, set of\nmethodological commitments, and theoretical implications. Taking aim\nat social practices, self-understandings, identities and normative\ncommitments that are seen as natural or accepted as given,\ngenealogical critique traces their historical emergence, highlighting\ntheir contingency and denaturalizing them with the aim of opening up\nthe possibility of thinking and acting differently. From this\nperspective, the search for normative foundations is misguided as it\nboth underestimates how normativity is shaped by unacknowledged\nhistories and power relations and overestimates the transformative\npower of a normative critique that appeals to reason alone.\nGenealogical critique, by contrast, seeks to destabilize and decenter\nthe subject and its fundamental commitments (Owen 2002, Hoy and\nMcCarthy 1994; for a version of this claim that builds on\npsychoanalytic theory, see Allen 2021, Ch. 5).\n\nWhile earlier engagements with genealogical critique, especially\nFoucault\u2019s, were marked by criticisms of his supposed rejection\nof all normative and rational standards, lack of social theorizing,\nand relativism (Habermas 1985, Chs. IX\u2013X, Fraser 1981, Dews\n1987), more recently critical theorists have sought to emphasize the\npotential convergence and mutual illumination of genealogy and\nFrankfurt School critical theory in providing an analysis of the\nworkings of contemporary forms of power and domination (Allen 2008,\nKoopman 2013, Ch. 7, Saar 2018). At the same time, a recent debate\nbetween Forst and Wendy Brown exemplifies how the earlier split\nbetween Habermas and Foucault is rearticulated today, with Forst\ntaking a broadly Habermasian position in arguing that his\n\u201crespect conception of tolerance\u201d manages to safeguard the\nautonomy of individuals by grounding toleration in the right to\njustification, and Brown insisting, with Foucault, on the normalizing,\ndisciplining, and depoliticizing effects of liberal discourses of\ntoleration that ultimately obfuscate the complex operations of social\npower (Brown and Forst 2014, see also Vogelmann 2021).\n\nA genealogical orientation also characterizes postcolonial critiques\nof Frankfurt School critical theory that point out the lack of\nexplicit and sustained engagement with European colonialism and\nimperialism and its legacies, including contemporary forms of racism,\nand the ways in which these have enabled and shaped the processes of\n\u201cmodernization\u201d and thus the formation of\n\u201cmodern\u201d\u2019 societies, subjects, and forms of\nknowledge and rationality, all of which critical theorists purport to\ninvestigate critically (see\n \u00a74.1.3\n below).\n",
