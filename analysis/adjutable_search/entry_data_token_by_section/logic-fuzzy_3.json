G\u00f6del\u2013Dummett logic\n\nG\u00f6del\u2013Dummett logic, also known as Dummett\u2019s LC or\nsimply as G\u00f6del logic, is another early example of a many-valued\nlogic with truth-values in \\([0,1]\\). It was introduced by Michael\nDummett (1959) as the extension of\n intuitionistic logic\n by the axiom \n\n\\[(\\varphi \\to \\psi) \\lor (\\psi \\to \\varphi).\\]\n\n This formula enforces a linear order in the\nunderlying (Kripke-style as well as algebraic) semantics. It also\nappears in the context of Kurt G\u00f6del\u2019s observation that it\nis impossible to characterize intuitionistic logic by finite truth\ntables (G\u00f6del 1932). In the fuzzy logic setting,\nG\u00f6del\u2013Dummett logic can alternatively be obtained as an\naxiomatic extension of MTL by adding the axiom \\(\\varphi \\to \\varphi\n\\mathbin{\\&} \\varphi\\), which amounts to requiring the idempotence\nof \\(\\&\\), and hence the interpretation of both conjunctions\ncoincides. Semantically, G\u00f6del\u2013Dummett logic can also be\ndefined as the consequence relation given by the minimum t-norm. It is\ndistinguished as the only t-norm based logic where the validity of a\nformula in a given evaluation does not depend on the specific values\nassigned to the propositional variables, but only on the relative\norder of these values. In this sense, G\u00f6del\u2013Dummett logic\ncan be seen as a logic of comparative truth. Like for \u0141ukasiewicz\nlogic, the computational complexity of testing validity remains\ncoNP-complete.\n",
