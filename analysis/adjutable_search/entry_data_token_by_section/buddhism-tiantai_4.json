The stipulation of Emptiness\n(\u015a\u016bnyat\u0101) was itself a raft to get beyond not\nonly all other determinate views but also Emptiness itself as a\n\u201cview\u201d or theory or concept. Ultimate Truth, true\nrealization of Emptiness, was thus at best a celebratory term used to\npoint to an ineffable experience of the liberation from all views, all\ndefinite conceptions of determinate \u201cthings\u201d. The\nmotivation for this was soteriological in a specific, pan-Buddhist\nsense: the goal of all human endeavor, including philosophy, including\nethics, including epistemology, is assumed to be the reduction or\nelimination of suffering. Buddhism claims that this is what\nwe\u2019re always trying to do, but usually in a self-defeating,\nignorant way; it claims to provide a more effective way. Note that\nthis does not make any claim about what is valuable, but rather\naddresses what is assumed to be a necessary entailment of what it\nmeans to consider anything valuable, i.e., what structures desire qua\ndesire. To desire is to value, and suffering is simply the\nnon-satisfaction of our desire. Hence all endeavors are endeavors to\neliminate some suffering, i.e., to satisfy a desire. The\ncharacteristic Buddhist contribution is then to note that desiring any\nconditional object or state is necessarily self-defeating. This is\nbecause to be conditional is to be brought into being by a\nqualitatively distinct, heterogeneous and extrinsic cause. But\nexamined closely, this cannot be a single extrinsic cause,\nfor if any effect were produced by a single cause, that cause and that\neffect would always be copresent\u2014wherever and whenever that\ncause occurred, the effect would also occur. But that would mean that\nthe cause would therefore no longer be extrinsic to the effect; they\nwould be, rather, necessary and intrinsically conjoined, actually two\naspects of a single irreducible entity, which would mean that no\ncausal event actually ever occurs. This means that all conditional\nthings require multiple causes, each of which itself requires multiple\ncauses.\n\nThis introduces an intrinsic instability and inner conflict into\nwhatever exists conditionally, that is, whatever is finite, whatever\nis determinate. The unconditional would have to be omnipresent and\nomnitemporal and indeterminate. But the nature of desire is to have\nspecific conditions of satisfaction: to desire is to require some one\nstate of affairs rather than, to the exclusion of,\nsome other state of affairs\u2014minimally, pleasure instead of\npain. This means all desire qua desire is desire for something\nconditional; otherwise there would be no need for the desire, since\nthe desired state would already always and everywhere be present.\nDesire desires a single effect to the exclusion of any other effect;\nbut the denial of effectivity for any single cause also\nimplies that what is produced by any causal process can never be only\na single effect. For since what is produced is not dependent\nsolely on any single cause, or indeed any finite set of causes\nconsidered as a unit, the production of a new event always requires\nthe conjunction with some hitherto excluded condition. Since by\nhypothesis this new condition is not a consistent part of the original\nset, it will not always be the same, and thus the effect will not be\none and the same; every conjunction will produce its own effects, and\nby hypothesis there is no limit to the set of conjunctions (for that\nwould make them simply a single cause). Less rigorously, it is held\nthat the cross-purposes and conflicting tendencies thus built into any\neffect make it impossible for it to be a stably homogenous entity\nconsistently isolable from the opposite conditional states it means to\nexclude, such as is required by the exclusive structure of specific\ndesires. Whatever is desired must be identifiably present at a\nparticular time and place, and whatever is such is conditional, and\nwhatever is conditional entails impermanence, and thus suffering.\n\nThe pan-Buddhist denial of the existence of a \u201cself\u201d rests\non the same point: the impossibility of single-cause causal events.\nFor the \u201cself\u201d rejected here is precisely the claimant to\nsingle-causality: the agent of actions which putatively requires no\nsecond condition to produce an effect, e.g., to will something, to do\nsomething, to want something, to experience something. The self never\nacts alone, has no independent effects, and thus actually is not a\nself-as-efficacious-agent. \u201cSelf\u201d here essentially means\n\u201ccontroller\u201d. Because there is no single causality, there\nis no single controller, and thus no self. For this reason too,\nsatisfaction of desire is not sustainable. For in doing what the self\ndesires, other causes besides the activity of the self are always also\ninvolved; the effect is not in the self\u2019s control, and thus will\ninevitably contravene its desires, its own causal contributions to the\neffect. Indeed, the early Buddhist analysis of the human condition\namounts to the claim that all desire is really a proxy-version of this\nimpossible desire for control, for single-agent causality, for pure\nautonomy, for selfhood; thus all desire is doomed.\n\nThe same considerations have serious epistemological consequences as\nwell. The Buddhists viewed theoretical stances and philosophical\npositions as themselves objects of desire, of clinging. Since all such\nstances are themselves specific, determinate, they are ipso\nfacto conditional. As conditional, they are ipso facto\nsuffering. Hence attachment to views was seen as a form of suffering\nand an obstacle to liberation. All determinate metaphysical views\nabout how or what things are were to be transcended and left\nbehind.\n\nIn most of the dominant Indian theories, those ideas are granted\ntemporary validity as conventional truths: they are to serve as\n\u201crafts\u201d, to be clung to temporarily, but only because they\nare an effective means of passing beyond themselves. This includes\nboth specific Buddhist doctrines and also ordinary conventional speech\n(necessary for even communicating Buddhist ideas). Whatever ideas do\nnot lead to their own abandonment in this way (and hence do not lead\nto the end of suffering) do not count even as conventional\ntruths\u2014for example, 1) metaphysical and religious theories about\nthe Absolute, or unconditional claims about the world as a whole and\n2) non-conventional views of things in the world, claims that\ncontravene ordinary language of the community. There tends to be a\nkind of hierarchy in the Indian Two Truths theory: first, plain\nfalsehood, including all philosophical theories about reality and\nunconventional views. Then conventional truth, which includes ordinary\ndaily life ideas about self and other, cause and effect and so on, and\nalso Buddhist ideas about suffering, the Four Noble Truths, non-self,\nand even \u201cEmptiness\u201d considered as a concept. These ideas\nlead beyond themselves, instrumentally, to the experience of\nEmptiness, which is liberation from all views. The conventional truths\nhad an instrumental value, but none were really \u201ctrue\u201d\nabout things\u2014Emptiness meant that all of them were, in the most\nultimate sense, false. Also, there are really only one or two kinds of\nconventional truth: first, common sense daily speech, the correct\ngeneral names for things as used in the daily life of your particular\ncommunity, and second, Buddhist ideas. The reason these count as\n\u201ctruths\u201d is because they are useful in leading us to\nliberation from suffering\u2014and in leading us to liberation from\nthese ideas themselves. \u201cTrue\u201d propositions are\npropositions that have the power to lead beyond themselves.\n\nThis led to a somewhat paradoxical situation, on several levels. There\nwas always a problem in Emptiness theory: Emptiness was supposed to be\nnot a \u201cview\u201d at all, to predicate nothing about reality.\nBut if it does anything at all, if it negates or\nexcludes any other view, it is, in the Tiantai view, still a kind\nof view. For to be something in particular is just to exclude\nsomething else in particular. That is all a\n\u201cthing\u201d is, that is all a \u201cview\u201d is. To be\nsomething just is to exclude something else; nothing more is\nrequired to count as a being. Pre-Tiantai Emptiness theory gets into\nan infinite regress, chasing its tail around the problem of the\ntranscendence of Emptiness: no statement can represent it, even\n\u201call things are Empty\u201d. It is purely and totally above and\nbeyond anything that can be thought or said, all ordinary experience\nof identities in the world. It is a negation that is supposed to bear\nno relation at all to what it negates, to entirely escape the system\nof relations, of conditionality. Emptiness is supposed to be strictly\n\u201cinconceivable\u201d. In Tiantai, this problem disappears.\nEmptiness is still very important, but it is simply a\nconditional assertion of unconditionality. We do not have all\nthe conditionality (specifiability, particularity) on one side and all\nthe unconditionality (transcendence, inconceivability) on the other.\nEverything, every experience, every identity, every action, is in the\nsame boat: they are all both conditional and unconditional, both\nconceivable and inconceivable. The thought, experience, concept\n\u201cEmptiness\u201d is also both conditional and unconditional,\nboth conceivable and inconceivable, like \u201cwater\u201d and\n\u201cfire\u201d in our example about. Emptiness is an especially\nefficient marker of self-exploded holism, the term that applies most\neasily everywhere and thus ultimately nowhere, allowing all other\nterms to do the same. It is Provisionally Posited, which means it is\nat least locally coherent (conditional, determinate, conceivable), but\nit itself is also Empty, which means it is globally incoherent\n(unconditional, indeterminate, inconceivable). It appears in\nexperience as something in particular (locally coherent as precisely\nthis word and this thought \u201cEmptiness\u201d), but this, like\nevery other local coherence, is haunted by its own inseparable nimbus\nof infinite outsides, infinite contexts, each of which differently\ncontextualizes it and thus bestows on it alternate identities: there\nis more to it than any single concept, including the concept\n\u201cEmptiness\u201d, can hold. Emptiness is, to use a word coined\nfor just this Tiantai usage, \u201cmoretoitivity\u201d (i.e., the\nquality of always constitutively having more-to-it): and\nmoretoitivity is itself moretoitive. It appears not just as\nmoretoitivity, but as specific identities, something more, above and\nbeyond, simple moretoitivity as such. Ambiguity is itself ambiguous:\nfire is not just fire, it is ambiguous; but the ambiguity is not just\nambiguity, it is also fire. This applies to everything else as well.\nLocal coherence and global coherence (Provisional Positing and\nEmptiness) are just two ways of saying the same thing.\n\nIn the Tiantai \u201cThree Truths\u201d theory, instead of\nconcluding that every particular view and thing is false, we conclude\nthat all is, ultimately, true. Every possible view is equally a truth.\nThere is no longer a hierarchy between the levels, and no category of\nplain falsehood. \u201cConventional Truth\u201d in Tiantai is not\nsomething to be left behind when we reach enlightenment, but rather\nwhat is obtained and mastered and intensified there. Moreover, nothing\nis left out of it\u2014all possible statements, viewpoints, ideas,\nconcepts, positions are conventional truths. The criterion is still\nthe same: all things can be used as \u201cskillful means\u201d to\nlead to Buddhahood. So now we have Three Truths, which are not a\nraft-like instrument to get beyond all statements and concepts, and a\nfinal higher truth that allows us to have no biased and particular\nview of things, but rather as three true ways of viewing any\nparticular thing. It is not a raft to get beyond all rafts, but a raft\nthat leads to the raft factory that makes and houses all rafts, and\nallows one to move at will from any raft to any other raft, including\nthe initial one. However you may be viewing a particular part of the\nworld or the world as a whole, it is \u201cconventionally\u201d\ntrue. There are not just a few conventional truths, but an infinite\nnumber of them, even when they are directly opposed and contradictory.\nSo in Two Truths theory, we would say that \u201cthis is a cup\u201d\nis conventionally true, and \u201cthis cup is empty\u201d is a\nhigher conventional truth, which finally leads us to a direct\ninconceivable experience of the emptiness of this cup, freedom from\nclinging to any view at all of this cup, which is the liberation from\nall suffering. If someone were to point to this \u201ccup\u201d and\nsay, \u201cThis is an elephant\u201d, however, that would not even\nbe a conventional truth, because that is not how most people think of\nit, it is neither the ordinary speech of the language community, nor a\nBuddhist term designed to lead beyond itself. That would be a plain\nerror. And if someone said, \u201cThis is an expression of the will\nof God\u201d, that would also be an error, not even a conventional\ntruth, since it tried to make a claim beyond that of conventional\nusage to an ultimate, universally applicable, absolute truth. But in\nTiantai Three Truths theory, it is just as true to say, \u201cThis is\nan elephant\u201d or \u201cThis is the Will of Baal\u201d as to say\n\u201cThis is a cup\u201d. And neither of these is less true than\nsaying, \u201cThis is empty\u201d, or indeed any less true than\n\u201cexperiencing\u201d the emptiness of this cup/elephant. In both\ncases, what we have is a locally coherent way of viewing this\nthing\u2014it just means that it looks that way from some\nperspective, within some set of parameters, for some length of time.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter anymore whether those parameters are shared by\nthe common sense of a particular community or speech group; all that\nmatters is that it is possible to make it look that way, that it looks\nthat way from anywhere, for even one moment. In Two\nTruths and Emptiness theory, nothing is really true. In Tiantai Three\nTruths theory, everything is true. We don\u2019t need an\nextra \u201cEmptiness\u201d outside of this locally coherent way of\nseeing things; Emptiness just means that whatever is locally\ncoherent is also, ipso facto, globally\nincoherent. That is, when all factors are taken into\nconsideration, the original way any thing appears is no longer\nunambiguously present, but it restored as a raft leading to all other\nrafts, including itself, as ineradicable aspects of all reality, of\nany reality.\n",
