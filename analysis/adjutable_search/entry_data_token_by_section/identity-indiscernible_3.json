    "main_text": "Arguments for and against the Principle\n4. The History of the Principle\n\n\nLeibniz prudently restricts the Principle to substances. Moreover,\nLeibniz is committed to saying that the extrinsic properties of\nsubstances supervene on the intrinsic ones, which collapses the\ndistinction between the strong and the Weak Principles. \n\n\nAlthough the details of Leibniz\u2019s metaphysics are debatable, the\nPrinciple would seem to follow from Leibniz\u2019s thesis of the\npriority of possibility. (See Leibniz\u2019s remarks on possible\nAdams in his 1686 letter to Arnauld, in Loemker 1969, p. 333.) It does\nnot appear to require the Principle of Sufficient Reason, which\nLeibniz sometimes bases it on. (See for example Section 21 of\nLeibniz\u2019s fifth paper in his correspondence with Clarke (Loemker\n1969, p. 699). See also Rodriguez-Pereyra 1999.) For Leibniz takes God\nto have created by actualising substances which already exist as\npossibilia. Hence there could only be indiscernible actual substances\nif there were indiscernible ones which were merely possible. Hence if\nthe Principle holds for merely possible substances it holds for actual\nones as well.  There is, therefore, no point in speculating as to\nwhether there might not be a sufficient reason to actualise two of a\npossible substance, for God cannot do that since both would have to be\nidentical to the one possible substance. The Principle restricted to\nmerely possible substances follows from Leibniz\u2019s identification\nof substances with complete concepts. For two complete concepts must\ndiffer in some conceptual respect and so be discernible.\n",
