    "main_text": "Arguments Against Constructive Empiricism || The Miracle Argument\n3.1 The Miracle Argument\n\nOne way that the constructive empiricist might indirectly support\nconstructive empiricism is by taking issue with Hilary Putnam\u2019s\nmiracle argument for scientific realism. This argument holds that\nscientific realism \u201cis the only philosophy that doesn\u2019t\nmake the success of science a miracle\u201d (Putnam 1975, 73). Putnam\ngoes on to argue that the statements that a scientific realist would\nmake about our mature scientific theories are \u201cpart of the only\nscientific explanation of the success of science.\u201d To give an\nadequate scientific description of science, scientific realism needs\nto be assumed.\n\nPutnam\u2019s basic idea is as follows: if the scientific theories\nare false, why would they be so successful? Van Fraassen famously\nreplies with an evolutionary analogy:\n\nI claim that the success of current scientific theories is no miracle.\nIt is not even surprising to the scientific (Darwinist) mind. For any\nscientific theory is born into a life of fierce competition, a jungle\nred in tooth and claw. Only the successful theories survive\u2014the\nones which in fact latched on to actual regularities in\nnature. (van Fraassen 1980, 40)\n\n\nVan Fraassen\u2019s point is that a theory can be empirically\nadequate, and hence latch on to the observable regularities in nature,\nwithout being true. The scientific competition between theories hinges\non which theory accurately describes the observable world; it does not\nhinge on which theory is actually true. Thus, it would not be\nmiraculous for science to arrive at an empirically adequate,\nscientifically successful, yet false theory. (See the discussion of\nthe Miracle Argument in the entry on\n scientific realism\n for more on the miracle argument as a consideration in favor of\nscientific realism.)\n",
