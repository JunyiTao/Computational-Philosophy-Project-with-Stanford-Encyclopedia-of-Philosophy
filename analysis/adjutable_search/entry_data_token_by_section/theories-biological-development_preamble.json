    "main_text": "\n\nDevelopment is a central biological process, and ideas about its\nnature have been influential in biological thought. This entry surveys\nthe history of these ideas through the lens of \u201cepigenesis vs.\npreformation\u201d. Epigenesis is, roughly, the thesis that every\ndeveloping entity starts from material that is unformed, with form\nemerging gradually, over time, in the process of development.\nPreformation, in contrast, is the thesis that development begins with\nthe entity in some way already preformed, or predelineated, or\npredetermined. The question \u201cepigenesis or preformation?\u201d\nis in part metaphysical: what is it that exists\u2014form or also the\nunformed that becomes the formed? And it is partly epistemological:\nhow do we know\u2014through observation or inference? Debate on these\nentangled questions has persisted since ancient times, and today plays\nout as genetic determinists appeal to the already \u201cformed\u201d\nthrough genetic inheritance, while others insist on the efficacy of\nenvironmental plasticity. This entry surveys the main theories of\ndevelopment that engage this debate, from Aristotle on generation, to\nrecent systems-theoretic and stem cell-based views. Of course,\n\u201cepigenesis vs. preformation\u201d is not the only longstanding\ntheoretical opposition that bears on development. But this framing is\nan inclusive way to capture patterns of transformation and constancy\nin debates about biological development. Nature or nurture, epigenesis\nor preformation, genetic determinism or developmental free will, or is\nsome version of a middle ground possible? The terms of this perennial\ndiscussion, and the underlying assumptions, continue to shape debates\nabout when life begins and have profound bioethical and policy\nimplications.\n",
