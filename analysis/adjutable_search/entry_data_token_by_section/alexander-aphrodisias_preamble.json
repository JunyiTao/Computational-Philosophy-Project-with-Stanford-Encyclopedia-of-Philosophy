    "main_text": "\n\nAlexander was a Peripatetic philosopher and commentator, active in the\nlate second and early third century CE. He continued the tradition of\nwriting close commentaries on Aristotle\u2019s work established in the\nfirst century BCE by Andronicus of Rhodes, the editor of Aristotle\u2019s\n\u2018esoteric\u2019 writings, which were designed for use in his\nschool only. This tradition reflected a gradual revival of interest in\nAristotle\u2019s philosophy, beginning in the late second century BCE, and\nhelped to reestablish Aristotle as an active presence in philosophical\ndebates in later antiquity. Aristotle\u2019s philosophy had fallen into\nneglect and disarray in the second generation after his death and\nremained in the shadow of the Stoics, Epicureans, and Academic\nskeptics throughout the Hellenistic age. Andronicus\u2019 edition of\nwhat was to become the Corpus Aristotelicum consolidated a\nrenewed interest in Aristotle\u2019s philosophy, albeit in a different\nform: active research was replaced by learned elucidations of The\nPhilosopher\u2019s difficult texts. The commentaries themselves served as\nmaterial for the exposition of Aristotle\u2019s work to a restricted circle\nof advanced students. Hence each generation of teachers produced their\nown commentaries, often relying heavily on their predecessors\u2019\nwork. Thus, the \u2018scholastic\u2019 treatment of authoritative\ntexts that was to become characteristic of the Middle Ages had already\nstarted in the first century BCE. Alexander, due to his meticulous and\nphilosophically astute exegesis of a wide range of Aristotle\u2019s texts,\nin logic, physics, psychology, metaphysics and ethical topics, became\nknown as the exemplary commentator throughout later antiquity\nand the Arabic tradition. He is often referred to simply as \u2018The\nCommentator\u2019 (ho ex\u00eaget\u00eas), later sharing\nthis title with Avicenna or Averroes. Because there is little evidence\non Alexander\u2019s life and activities, his commentaries and his short\ntreatises on topics related more or less closely to Aristotelian\ndoctrine provide all the information we have about him as a\nphilosopher and a man. As these writings show, his main contemporary\nopponents were the Stoics, but there is also some evidence of a\ncontroversy with Galen. Alexander is not only regarded as the best of\nthe ancient commentators but also as the last strictly Aristotelian\none, whose aim was to present and defend Aristotle\u2019s philosophy as a\ncoherent whole, well suited to engage contemporary philosophical\ndiscussions. The later commentators were members of the Neoplatonist\nschools and were concerned to document the substantial agreement of\nPlatonic and Aristotelian thought, and to integrate Aristotle\u2019s work\ninto their Neoplatonist philosophical system. But they continued not\nonly to consult, discuss, but also to criticize, Alexander\u2019s work, a\nfact that probably accounts for its survival.\n",
