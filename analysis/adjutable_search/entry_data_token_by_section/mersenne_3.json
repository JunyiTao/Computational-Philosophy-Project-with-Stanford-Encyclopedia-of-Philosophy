    "main_text": "Metaphysical Issues || Proofs of God\u2019s Existence\n3.2 Proofs of God\u2019s Existence\n\nThe bulk of Mersenne\u2019s contribution to rational theology is\ncontained in the 700 or so first columns of his Quaestiones in\nGenesim, where no less than 35 proofs of God\u2019s existence\nare reckoned and detailed. The importance of rational demonstration is\ndirectly related to the apologetic project: one cannot simply be\ncontent with the idea that God is immediately known, as this could not\nshut the mouths of the atheists. The encyclopedic turn of the\nrecension is obvious, and Mersenne, ready to use all means available\nto contradict the atheists, was not taken aback by the fact that these\nproofs belong to various, and sometimes adverse, theological\ntraditions. After summoning the consensus of all creatures, and the\nconsensus of all men, Mersenne resorted to cosmological arguments,\narguing, from the contingency of our word, and the contingency of our\nown finite existence, that \u201cit is necessary that something\nexists by itself\u201d. Here Mersenne borrowed from Hugues of Saint\nVictor and Jean Damascene.\n\nHe also presented at some length the Anselmian argument, arguing that\nexistence should be attributed to God, on account of the fact that the\nvery idea of God (that even the insane atheist should have in his\nmind) obliges us to consider that nothing greater can exist, and that\nexistence in re is obviously a greater thing than existence\nin the mind. Mersenne, who did not mention Aquinas\u2019s criticisms,\nfound the argument \u201cexcellent and very pious\u201d (QG: col\n37). He also paid much credit to the Augustinian argument from\n\u201ceternal truths\u201d\u2014Mathematical truths in particular\nwould not be possible without the supposition of an eternal mind in\nwhich they reside:\n\n\nopen your mind\u2019s eyes, \u00f4 atheist, and see how numerous and\nstrong are the arguments through which arithmetic asks you to embrace\nthe divine unity, without which Arithmetic would not hold, as all\nmaterial unity or numerical is impossible without the supposition of\ndivine unity. \u2026 One objects to the atheist\u2019s geometry, if\never one listens to Plato who recognizes God from this very science,\nas he said that God never ceases to practice geometry. (QG Praefatio:\na2)\n\n\nIt is to be noted that the two a priori arguments (from\neternal truths and from the idea of a perfect being) are the only two\nthat are brought in in the Impi\u00e9t\u00e9 to dispel atheism. In\nthe Quaestiones however more than half of Mersenne\u2019s\narguments were a posteriori ones: from the creation ex\nnihilo, from the beauty of creatures, from the given natural law,\nfrom the harmony of the universe\u2026 All allowed lengthy\nscientific excursuses, demonstrating God\u2019s intelligence and\nprovidence through whatever the sciences can show of the order of\nthings. Among these arguments, Mersenne paid only lip service to the\nclassical Aristotelian and Thomist \u201cargument from motion\u201d,\nwhich states that the world needs an immutable first mover, probably\nbecause he is aware that the argument had been used in Paduan\nAristotelianism in order to defend the coeternity of the world and its\nfirst mover. In the other a posteriori proofs, the regressive\nmove from the creation to the creator was not as likely to subject the\ncreator to the creation.\n\nProminent in the Quaestiones and\nImpi\u00e9t\u00e9, rational theology tended to recede in\nimportance in subsequent works. Although in the Quaestiones,\nMersenne had hinted at another work (\u201cperfectum\nopus\u201d) to come, it was never written. After 1624 he became\nmore reluctant to consider proofs of God\u2019s existence, hinting in\nhis correspondence with Ruarus that it might not be possible to give a\ntruly demonstrative one, however sensible and approved by everyone was\nthe truth of God\u2019s existence. His doubts were now on a par with\nthe ones he came to entertain regarding demonstrations in physical\nmatters. In his Questions th\u00e9ologiques, he wrote in a\nsomewhat autobiographical tone, that everyone could see for themselves\nthat:\n\n\nfresh from the Philosophy and Theology courses, they used to imagine\nthat they could give a reason for everything, whereas 20 or 30 years\nlater they are compelled to confess that they know no reason that\nsatisfies them and is so evident and certain that they cannot doubt\nit. (QT: 10)\n\n\nThis may shed some light on Mersenne\u2019s role in the writing of\nthe second objections to Descartes\u2019s Meditations, where\ndoubts were cast on the demonstrative character of the Cartesian\nproofs of God\u2019s existence, and especially on the ontological\nproof, whose Anselmian version was so much favoured by Mersenne in his\nyounger years. It has been argued (Garber 2001), quite convincingly,\nthat Jean-Baptiste Morin, a member of the Mersenne circle, and the\nauthor of a booklet on God\u2019s existence written in a geometrical\nfashion (Morin 1635) had an important hand in the composition of the\nsecond objections and that he was probably the one who suggested the\nrequest of presenting the Meditations arguments in a geometrical\nmanner. Mersenne, however would have concurred with the reservations,\nimplicit in this demand, concerning Descartes\u2019s claim to the\nhigher certainty of metaphysical demonstrations over mathematical\nones.\n",
