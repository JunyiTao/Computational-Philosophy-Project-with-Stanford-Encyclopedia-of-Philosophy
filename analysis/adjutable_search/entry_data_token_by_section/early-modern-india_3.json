    "main_text": "Physical Substance || The Five Primary Physical Substances\n2.1 The Five Primary Physical Substances\n\nVai\u015be\u1e63ika distinguishes, among nine acknowledged types of\nsubstance, a sub-class of five\u2014earth, water, fire, air and\n\u0101k\u0101\u015ba\u2014to which it gives the name\n\u201cbh\u016bta\u201d (\u2018physical substance\u2019).\nA bh\u016bta is defined as a substance which possesses a\nspecific sensible quality\u2014odour, taste, colour, touch and\nsound.\n\nIt was, perhaps, originally thought that the five physical substances\nand the five sensible qualities are directly correlated, each quality\nresiding in one and only one substance, odour just in earth, taste\njust in water etc. (such a view is reported by V\u0101tsy\u0101yana\nunder NS 3.1.65\u20136). This may give some insight into the origins\nof the \u2018five physical substances\u2019 theory, but it was\nrealised very early on that it is extremely implausible to maintain\nthat earth, for example, is invisible, or else that its colour is\nalways due to intermixture with fire (Bhaduri 1947: 133). The set of\ncorrelations between physical substances and sensible qualities is\nmore complex in the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika-s\u016btras and\nlater texts, and is indicated in the following chart:\n\n\n\n \nodour\ntaste\ncolour\ntouch\nsound \n\nearth\nx\nx\nx\nx\n  \n\nwater\n \nx\nx\nx\n  \n\nfire\n \n \nx\nx\n  \n\nair\n \n \n \nx\n  \n\n\u0101k\u0101\u015ba\n \n \n \n \nx  \n\n\nThe orthodox Vai\u015be\u1e63ika view is that each physical substance\nis characterised by the possession of a particular type of sensible\nquality and the absence of certain others. Thus, earth is the\nsubstance endowed with odour, water with taste but not odour, fire\nwith colour but not taste or odour, etc. A drawback of such\ndefinitions is that we cannot infer, from the detection of a sensible\nquality, which type of substance is present. Later\nVai\u015be\u1e63ika therefore looks for a diagnostic set of\ndefinitions, one which seeks to find, for each substance, a particular\nsensible quality whose presence is indicative of that substance. The\nManual of Reason (TS 10\u201314):\n\nEarth is (specifically) endowed with odour\n\nWater is (specifically) endowed with cold touch\n\nFire is (specifically) endowed with hot touch\n\nAir is (specifically) endowed with touch without colour\n\n\u0101k\u0101\u015ba is (specifically) endowed with sound.\n\n\nThus, although earth, water, and fire are all tactile, only water\nallegedly has cold touch. It seems that it could find no positive\ndistinguishing trait for air, and thus reverted to the older style of\ndefinition.\n\nIt is perhaps surprising to find a \u2018five elements\u2019 theory\ndefended still in the seventeenth century. Some modern writers have\ntried to represent these substances as metaphors for different\n\u2018states\u2019 of matter\u2014solid (earth), liquid (water),\ngas (air), and temperature (fire). This is, however, improbable, for\nit is nowhere said that a particular substance can turn from earth to\nwater to air. Perhaps it is a mistake to see the theory as belonging\nto physics at all; instead, bearing in mind the way the substances are\ndefined in terms of their sensible qualities, we might see it as an\nexercise in the logical analysis of the data presented by the various\nsense modalities to construct a (metaphysical) theory of the world.\nSuch a theory would, for example, explain the fact that there are\ncorrelations between what we see and what we touch by positing that\nthere must be types of things which can be both seen and touched.\nLikewise, the occurrence of tactile sensations with no correlated\nvisual sensations leads us to postulate the existence of substances\nwhich can be felt but not seen (air), and so on for the other\nsubstances. It is, after all, the existence of such correlations\nbetween different sense modalities which grounds an objective\nconception of the world (phenomena accessible only by one sense are\nmore likely to be thought of as subjective in origin).\n",
