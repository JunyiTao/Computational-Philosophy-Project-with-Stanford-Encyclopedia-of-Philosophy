    "main_text": "The ethics of neuroscience || Practical neuroethics\n2.5 Practical neuroethics\n\nMedical practice and neuroscientific research raise a number of\nneuroethical issues, many of which are common to bioethics. For\nexample, issues of consent, of incidental findings, of competence, and\nof privacy of information arise here. In addition, practicing\nneurologists, psychologists and psychiatrists may routinely encounter\ncertain brain diseases, disabilities, or psychological dysfunctions\nthat raise neuroethical issues that they must address in their\npractices. (For a more detailed discussion of these more applied\nissues approached from a pragmatic point of view, see for example\nRacine, 2010; Martineau and Racine, 2020).\n",
