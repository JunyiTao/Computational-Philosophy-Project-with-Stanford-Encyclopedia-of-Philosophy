    "main_text": "Multiple Realizability Arguments || Appeals to Multiple Realizability in a Token System Over Time\n1.5 Appeals to Multiple Realizability in a Token System Over Time\n\nAnti-reductionists quickly came to stress the more radical form of\nmultiple realizability mentioned in\n section 1.1\n above, in a token system over times. As far back as the late 1970s,\nNed Block (1978) insisted that the narrowing of psychological kinds\nrequired to render them identifiable with specific physical (i.e.,\nneural) kinds due to the more radical type of multiple realizability\nwould render psychology incapable of capturing most all\ngeneralizations across realizers. Ronald Endicott (1993) gives\nBlock\u2019s point empirical backing by noting detailed facts about\nplasticity in individual human brains. The capacity for distinct\nneural structures and processes to subserve a given psychological\nfunction owing to trauma, damage, changing task demands, development,\nand other factors is extensive. These facts count further against any\nproposed reduction of, or identities between psychological and\nphysical kinds. Horgan (1993) clearly appeals to this radical sense of\nmultiple realizability when he writes:\n\n\nMultiple realizability might well begin at home. For all we now know\n(and I emphasize that we really do not now know), the\nintentional mental states we attribute to one another might turn out\nto be radically multiply realizable at the neurobiological level of\ndescription, even in humans; indeed, even in\nindividual humans; indeed, even in an individual human\ngiven the structure of his central nervous system at a single\nmoment of his life. (1993: 308; author\u2019s emphases)\n\n\nThis radical sense of multiple realizability was widely adopted among\nnonreductive physicalists, whose solution to the mind-body problem\nprobably remains the most popular position in Anglo-American\nphilosophy of mind. Putnam\u2019s original multiple realizability\nargument against the mind-brain identity (see\n \u00a71.2\n above) remains central to this view, with the second premise now\nreplaced with:\n\n(2\u2032)\n If some mental kinds are multiply realizable in this radical\nsingle-token-system-over-time sense, then psychology cannot be reduced\nto any physical science;\n\n\nand Putnam\u2019s original conclusion replaced with:\n\n(3\u2032)\n Psychology cannot be reduced to any physical science.\n\n",
