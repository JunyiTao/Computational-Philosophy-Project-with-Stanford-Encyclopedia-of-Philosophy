Pantheism and the distribution of value\n\nAlthough not all pantheists ascribe intrinsic value to the cosmos as a\nwhole, insofar as they do, that might be thought give rise to\nsomething of a puzzle. For if God is valuable and God is identical to\nthe universe then we might seem committed to the somewhat implausible\nthought that everything in the universe is equally valuable;\na leveling off which gave rise to Coleridge\u2019s complaint that\n\u2018everything God\u2019 and \u2018no God\u2019 are in effect\nidentical positions (Coleridge 1839, 224). The pantheist need not be\ncommitted to this view, however, for the fact that a certain feature\nor element is present in everything by no means entails that it is\nequally present in everything. Although the universe as a\nwhole may be divine, there is no need to regard each bit of it as\nuniformly divine; no need (for example) to feel quite the same about\nthe loss of biological species as we do about the disappearance of\nhuman cultures and languages. Historically, there have been two main\nways in which pantheists have regarded the distribution of value in\nthe universe.\n\n(1) Emphasis on nature. Most typically pantheism is\ncharacterized by deep love and reverence for the natural world insofar\nas it exists independently of human culture or civilization. The\npantheist finds God more in the waterfall or the rainforest than in\nthe car park or the gasworks. From the romantic period onwards this is\na very strong drive in both literary and popular pantheism, with urban\nand technological life regarded as at best a kind of self-interested\nanthropocentric distortion of true value and at worst even a kind of\nloss or separation from divinity.\n\nIf uncultivated nature is divine then the pantheist may legitimately\nconclude that it should be treated with respect, even as sacred. Such\nis the import of Aldo Leopold\u2019s \u2018land ethic\u2019 (1949)\nor the \u2018deep ecology\u2019 of Arne N\u00e6ss (1973), and many\nmodern pantheists have developed close connections with\nenvironmentalism. But neither the import nor the justification of such\nideas are straightforward. It might be suggested that as no one person\nought to put their own interests before another, neither ought any\nspecies to put itself ahead of another, nor the sentient ahead of the\ninsentient, nor the living ahead of the non-living. But with each\nfurther step this argument becomes harder to press, due to the extreme\ndifficulty of identifying\u2014and weighing\u2014such potentially\nconflicting interests. For example, unless the pantheist is some sort\nof panpsychist, he will not regard natural objects such as rivers or\nmountains as possessing sentience, purpose or interests of its own;\nwhich means that treating them with respect cannot be modelled on what\nit means to treat people or animals with respect (see Leidenhag\n2018).\n\n(2) Emphasis on humanity. A second and very different model\nfor understanding the relationship between divinity and value\nmaintains that God is most revealed in human culture and history. For\nthe Stoics, Reason or logos\u2014the essence of the\nworld\u2014though it underlies all things, is more strongly manifest\nin some (such as human life) than in others, while the virtues of\nstoic detachment and self-sufficiency preclude our true good being\nheld hostage to the state of anything external to ourselves, such as\nnature. This pair of attitudes is summed up in Cicero\u2019s\nnotorious assertion that all things were made for either Gods or men\n(Holland 1997, Baltzly 2003). But probably the best illustration of\nthis more anthropocentric way of thinking about value is the Hegelian\nsystem, in which Geist \u2014the spirit whose manifestation\nis the universe\u2014articulates itself in a developmental\nsequence of increasingly adequate expressions (which may or may not\nalso be temporal) up from the most basic abstractions of merely\nphysical nature, through the organic realm, up to its apex in the\nconcrete details of social and cultural life. The beauties of nature\nare valued as an approximation to those of art, and the development of\nethical life (Sittlichkeit) is literally \u201cthe march of\nGod in the world\u201d (Hegel 1821, 247).\n",
