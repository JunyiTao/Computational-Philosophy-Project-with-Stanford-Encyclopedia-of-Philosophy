    "main_text": "Metaphysical Sentimentalism || Subjectivism and Relativism\n4.1 Subjectivism and Relativism\n\nThe simplest way to link moral properties with our emotional or\nconative responses would be to say that what makes something wrong is\nthat it is disapproved of, or bad that it is not desired. No one holds\na view this elementary, since it entails that an undetected murder\nisn\u2019t morally wrong, for example. It also leaves undetermined\nwhose disapproval is at issue \u2013 what if one person disapproves\nof an action but someone else approves? What I\u2019ll call Simple\nDispositionalist Subjectivism improves on it by indexing moral\nproperties to subjects and referring to dispositions to cause\nresponses rather than actual responses. What makes something\nwrong-for-Mary, for example, is that Mary would disapprove of it, were\nshe aware of it. A related relativist proposal is that something is\nwrong-for-Mary if and only if Mary accepts a normative standard or\nframework that prohibits it (Harman 1975).\n\nThus, according to Jesse Prinz,\n\n\nAn action has the property of being morally wrong (right) just in case\nthere is an observer who has a sentiment of disapprobation\n(approbation) toward it. (Prinz 2007: 92)\n\n\n(Recall that for Prinz a sentiment is a disposition to feel\nvarious emotions, so wrongness doesn\u2019t hang on someone actually\nhaving a negative reaction to something.) But this claim is highly\nimplausible, given that wrongness is unindexed. It is true of almost\nanything that someone will disapprove of it, and someone else will\napprove of it. Thus, female genital cutting, for example, is\nsimultaneously both (absolutely) right and wrong. This is a\nsteep theoretical cost.\n\nSimple Dispositionalist Subjectivism seems to entail that if we were\nto begin to approve of slavery, slavery would come to be morally right\n\u2013 it would be true that we would respond to it positively when\nencountering it, say. But surely the correct description of such a\nscenario would not be that slavery has become right, but that we have\nbecome worse people (Broad 1944/5: 151). I call this the Missing\nRigidity Problem. The Missing Fallibility Problem, in\nturn, is that a simple subjectivist view seems to leave insufficient\nroom for mistakes about value. If what\u2019s right is\ndetermined by what I approve, I can only be mistaken about\nwhat\u2019s right if I\u2019m mistaken about what I in fact approve.\nBut it is very implausible that the remedy for moral mistakes is\nbetter introspection.\n",
