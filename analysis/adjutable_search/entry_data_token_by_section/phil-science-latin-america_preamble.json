    "main_text": "\n\nWhen philosophy of science began as a professional field in the late\n1940s, contributions from Latin America joined the forefront of the\ninternational debate right away. Philosophers of science from the\nsubcontinent have expanded their presence ever since. This article\naims to provide an overview of philosophy of science in the\nsubcontinent. The primary focus is on contributions produced in Latin\nAmerica by thinkers living in the region, with an emphasis on\n\u201cmainstream philosophy of science\u201d\u2014a discipline\ncentered on the study of scientific knowledge, metaphysics,\nmethodology, and values, broadly analytic in style, as exemplified by\nworks published in high-quality journals such as Philosophy of\nScience, Erkenntnis, The British Journal for the\nPhilosophy of Science, and Studies in the History and\nPhilosophy of Science.\n This entry has four parts. Section 1 provides historical\nbackground.  Section 2 is devoted to philosophy of science activity in\nvarious regional centers through the early 1990s when the Internet and\nimproved institutional resources \u201cglobalized\u201d the practice\nof philosophy of science, greatly blurring earlier geographical\nseparations. The two following sections focus on the last decades:\nSection 3 presents contributions to the general philosophy of science,\nand Section 4 reviews advances in the philosophy of special\nsciences. The final Section 5 briefly considers some of the\ndifficulties and prospects for philosophy of science in Latin\nAmerica.\n\nIn this article effort is made to provide an even-handed and objective\npicture, but of course only a selective sketch is possible, made of\nchoices influenced by the authors\u2019 interpretation of the\nfield.\n",
