    "main_text": "Scope of Decoherence || The world according to decoherence\n4.2 Further applications\n\nFurther along these lines, Zeh (2003b) argues that decoherence can\nexplain the appearance of particle detections within quantum\nfield theory (see the entry on\n quantum field theory).\n Therefore, only fields need to be included in the fundamental\nconcepts, and \u2018particles\u2019 are a derived concept, unlike\nwhat might be suggested by the customary introduction of fields\nthrough a process of \u2018second quantisation\u2019. Another\napplication to quantum field theory is the suggestion that the\njustification for the (strict) superselection rule for charge in\nquantum field theory can also be phrased in terms of decoherence. As\npointed out by Giulini, Kiefer and Zeh (1995; see also Giulini et\nal. 1996, Section 6.4), an electric charge is surrounded by a\nCoulomb field (which electrostatically is infinitely extended; the\nargument can also be carried out using the retarded field, though).\nStates of different electric charge of a particle are thus coupled to\ndifferent, presumably orthogonal, states of its electric field. One\ncan consider the far-field as an effectively uncontrollable\nenvironment that decoheres the particle (and the near-field), so that\nsuperpositions of different charges are indeed always\n suppressed.[40]\n\nAnother claim about the significance of decoherence relates to time\nasymmetry (see e.g. the entries on\n time asymmetry in thermodynamics\n and\n philosophy of statistical mechanics).\n Insofar as apparent collapse (branching) is indeed a time-directed\nprocess, decoherence will have direct relevance to the emergence of\nthis \u2018quantum mechanical arrow of time\u2019. This is not a\nstraightforward issue, however, and questions familiar from the\nfoundations of statistical mechanics arise also in the context of\ndecoherence. Specific issues include the fact that models of\nenvironmental decoherence tend to assume very special (unentangled)\ninitial conditions, and the fact that the definition of the\ndecoherence functional in the histories approach is itself\nasymmetrical (although symmetric versions also exist). For a spectrum\nof discussions, see Hartle (1998, and references therein), Zeh (2001,\nChapter 4), and Bacciagaluppi (2002, Section 6.1; 2007). Whether\ndecoherence is connected to the other familiar arrows of time is a\nmore specific question. Indeed, should decoherence allow us to recover\nthe time-symmetric classical description of, say, particle\ntrajectories in a gas, or does it allow us to derive time-asymmetric\nthermodynamic behaviour directly, by-passing classical attempts at\nunderstanding it? Note that insofar as classical systems such as gases\nare believed to be chaotic, the origin of the probabilities in\nclassical statistical mechanics will arguably be quantum. For various\ndiscussions, see e.g. Zurek and Paz (1994), Hemmo and Shenker (2001),\nand Wallace (2012a, Chapter 9; and 2001, 2013a, 2013b in the\n Other Internet Resources).\n \n\nFinally, it has been suggested that decoherence should be a useful\ningredient in a theory of quantum gravity (see the entry on\n quantum gravity),\n as discussed e.g. by Kiefer (1994). First, because a suitable\ngeneralisation of decoherence theory to a full theory of quantum\ngravity should yield suppression of interference between different\nclassical spacetimes (see e.g. also Giulini et al. 1996,\nSection 4.2). Second, it is speculated that decoherence might solve\nthe so-called problem of time, which arises as a prominent\npuzzle in (the \u2018canonical\u2019 approach to) quantum gravity.\nThis is the problem that the candidate fundamental equation (in this\napproach) \u2013 the Wheeler\u2013DeWitt equation \u2013 is an\nanalogue of a time-independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation, and\ndoes not contain time at all, so that time needs somehow to emerge. In\nthe context of decoherence theory, one can for instance construct toy\nmodels in which the analogue of the Wheeler\u2013DeWitt wave function\ndecomposes into non-interfering components (for a suitable sub-system)\neach satisfying a time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation,\nso that decoherence appears in fact as the source of time. An\naccessible introduction to and philosophical discussion of such models\nis given by Ridderbos (1999), with references to the original papers.\nSee also the more recent model by Halliwell and Thorwart\n (2002).[41]\n",
