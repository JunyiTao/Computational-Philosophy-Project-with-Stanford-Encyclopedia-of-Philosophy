    "main_text": "Arguments against Fictionalism || The Brock-Rosen objection\n5. Significance\n\nLet us lastly turn to the broader picture: the general philosophical\nsignificance of fictionalism.\n\nObviously, and as earlier remarked, the hermeneutic fictionalist can\ncome to the eliminativist antirealist\u2019s aid: adopting\nfictionalism is for the eliminativist antirealist a more attractive\nalternative than to adopt some form of error\n theory.[4]\n\n\nQuite apart from positive motivations for antirealism, fictionalism is\nalso of relevance for evaluating particular arguments for realism. Let\nme discuss two. (a) What we may call ordinary language\narguments. An ordinary language argument for the existence of\nFs goes as follows. \u201c(1) Sentences thus-and-such are\ntrue. (2) (Semantic analysis shows that) for those sentences to be\ntrue, there must be Fs. (3) So, there must be\nFs.\u201d An argument of this form is clearly valid. The\nquestion of the soundness of an argument of this kind comes down to\nwhether the premises are true. Hermeneutic fictionalism presents\nproblems for the justification of premise (1). Maybe all that is\nevident from ordinary discourse is that we somehow convey or\ncommunicate true propositions when uttering the relevant sentences.\nBut hermeneutic fictionalism indicates how we can do so without the\nsentences semantically expressing true propositions. Thomasson (2013)\nis a recent extended discussion of the relation between fictionalism\nand her own preferred ontological view, which is argued for by what\nshe calls \u201ceasy arguments\u201d, a kind of ordinary language\narguments. Thomasson\u2019s ontological deflationism says,\nroughly, that all manners of philosophically controversial entities\nexist, and do so in some sense trivially. The way Thomasson presents\nthings, fictionalism and ontological deflationism are in conflict. But\nif fictionalism is only a linguistic thesis (compare the distinction\nbetween the ontological thesis and the linguistic thesis) \u2014 and\nthat is how Thomasson appears to understand it \u2014 that\u2019s\nnot quite true. What is true is that fictionalism presents problems\nfor Thomasson\u2019s specific way of arguing for ontological\ndeflationism, by appeal to ordinary language arguments. (b)\nIndispensability. Let us again take mathematics as our example. One of\nthe most influential arguments for platonism in the philosophy of\nmathematics is the indispensability argument, according to which\nquantification over mathematical entities is indispensable to our best\ntheory of the world, and hence we should take mathematical entities to\nexist. (This is a very rough characterization of indispensability\narguments. For more detail see the entry on\n indispensability arguments in the philosophy of mathematics.)\n But revolutionary fictionalism suggests a complication: even if, in\nsome sense, quantification over mathematical entities is indispensable\nto our best theory of the world, perhaps it is not literal\nquantification over mathematical entities that is thus indispensable.\nThe relation between hermeneutic fictionalism and indispensability\narguments is a bit more indirect. But hermeneutic fictionalism is\nrelevant to indispensability arguments insofar as it is analyses of\nwhat scientists of various stripes actually say and believe that tell\nus what is \u201cour best theory of the world\u201d. \n\nThe arguments for realism just mentioned are arguments that typically\nwould be presented by those who take a \u2018Quinean\u2019 approach\nto ontology. Given this approach \u2014 the approach of many of those\ntheorists today who take ontology seriously \u2014 we should believe\nin those entities that our best theory of the world quantifies over.\nAlthough fictionalism presents problems for specific Quinean\narguments, like the indispensability argument, fictionalists are\nnaturally taken to be methodological allies of orthodox Quineans. They\ncan agree with orthodox Quineans that we should believe in those\nentities that our best theory of the world quantifies over. It is only\nthat they would stress that we must understand this to mean\n\u201cliterally quantifies over\u201d, and that in some\ninteresting cases the condition of literalness is not satisfied. \n\nMore radically, however, the theme of one of Yablo\u2019s earliest\npapers on fictionalism, Yablo (1998), is that the mere availability of\nfictionalism as a theoretical option presents problems for ontology as\na serious enterprise. Given that when the Quinean says that we should\nbelieve in what the best theory quantifies over, this must be\nunderstood to mean \u201cliterally quantifies over\u201d.\nBut then the Quinean program in ontology relies on the\nliteral/fictional distinction. But this distinction is problematic:\nsaying what parts of our speech are fictional and which are literal\nis, Yablo argues, at least as problematic as saying which sentences\nare synthetic and which are analytic. So there is at least as good\nreason to doubt the literal/fictional distinction \u2014 and hence\nthe Quinean program in ontology \u2014 as there is to doubt the\nanalytic/synthetic distinction. This is ad hominem, since Quine\nhimself famously attacked the analytic/synthetic distinction.\n\nThere are two metaontological points that someone might be inclined to\nmake here. A relatively moderate point is that it is often so hard to\nmake out on what side of the literal/fictional distinction some\ndiscourse falls that arguments of the Quinean kind seldom are well\nsupported. A different point is that there is sometimes \u2014 or, in\nthe most radical version of the idea, always \u2014 no fact of the\nmatter as to whether some piece of discourse is literal or fictional.\nIt is the most radical point here that is the most closely analogous\nto what Quine says about the analytic/synthetic distinction. \n",
