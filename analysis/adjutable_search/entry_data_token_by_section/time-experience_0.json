    "main_text": "What is \u2018the perception of time\u2019?\n1. What is \u2018the perception of time\u2019?\n\nThe very expression \u2018the perception of time\u2019 invites\nobjection. Insofar as time is something different from events, we do\nnot perceive time as such, but changes or events in\ntime. But, arguably, we do not perceive events only, but also their\ntemporal relations. So, just as it is natural to say that we perceive\nspatial distances and other relations between objects (I see the\ndragonfly as hovering above the surface of the water), it seems\nnatural to talk of perceiving one event following another (the\nthunderclap as following the flash of lightning), though even here\nthere is a difficulty. For what we perceive, we perceive as\npresent\u2014as going on right now. Can we perceive a\nrelation between two events without also perceiving the events\nthemselves? If not, then it seems we perceive both events as present,\nin which case we must perceive them as simultaneous, and so not as\nsuccessive after all. There is then a paradox in the notion of\nperceiving an event as occurring after another, though one that\nperhaps admits of a straightforward solution. When we perceive B as\ncoming after A, we have, surely, ceased to perceive A. In which case,\nA is merely an item in our memory. Now if we wanted to construe\n\u2018perceive\u2019 narrowly, excluding any element of memory, then\nwe would have to say that we do not, after all, perceive B as\nfollowing A. But in this article, we shall construe\n\u2018perceive\u2019 more broadly, to include a wide range of\nexperiences of time that essentially involve the senses. In this wide\nsense, we perceive a variety of temporal aspects of the world. We\nshall begin by enumerating these, and then consider accounts of how\nsuch perception is possible.\n",
