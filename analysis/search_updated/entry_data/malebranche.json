    "main_text": "\n1. Life and Works\n\nMalebranche was born in Paris on August 6, 1638, one month prior to\nLouis XIV, and died, also in Paris, on October 13, 1715, six weeks\nafter the great French monarch. Malebranche was one of many children\nborn to his mother, Catherine de Lauzon, the sister of a Viceroy of\nCanada, and his father, also Nicolas Malebranche, a secretary to Louis\nXIII. As in the case of Descartes and Pascal, Malebranche was born in\nfrail health. His particular affliction was a severe malformation of\nthe spine, and due to this condition as well as his weak lungs he\nneeded to be tutored at home until the age of sixteen. Subsequently he\nwas a student at the Coll\u00e8ge de la Marche, and after graduating\nhe went to study theology at the Sorbonne. His education left him with\na distaste for a scholasticism that focused on the work of Aristotle.\nThus, in 1660 he decided to leave the universities and to enter the\nOratory, a religious congregation founded in 1611 by the Augustinian\ntheologian Pierre B\u00e9rulle (1575\u20131629). At the Oratory in\nParis, Malebranche studied ecclesiastical history, linguistics, and\nthe Bible, and with his fellow students also immersed himself in the\nwork of Augustine. He was ordained a priest on September 14, 1664.\n\nThere is the story that in the same year in which he was ordained,\nMalebranche happened in a Paris bookstall upon a posthumous edition of\nDescartes\u2019s Trait\u00e9 de l\u2019homme\n(Treatise on Man) which provides a sketch of a mechanistic\naccount of the physiology of the human body. Malebranche\u2019s early\nbiographer, Father Yves Andr\u00e9, reported that he was so\n\u201cecstatic\u201d on reading this account that he experienced\n\u201csuch violent palpitations of the heart that he was obliged to\nleave his book at frequent intervals, and to interrupt his reading of\nit in order to breathe more easily\u201d (Andr\u00e9 1886,\n11\u201312). While Andr\u00e9 does not indicate why Malebranche was\nso moved, one can speculate that he had discovered in this text a way\nto investigate the natural world without relying on a stagnant\nAristotelian scholasticism. In any case, after his encounter with\nL\u2019homme Malebranche devoted himself to a decade-long\nstudy of the Cartesian method and its results in mathematics and\nnatural philosophy.\n\nThe fruit of this study is a two-volume work bearing the title, De\nla recherche de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9. O\u00f9 l\u2019on traitte\nde la nature de l\u2019esprit de l\u2019homme, et de l\u2019usage\nqu\u2019il en doit faire pour eviter l\u2019erreur dans les\nsciences (Search after Truth. In which is treated the nature\nof the human mind and the use that must be made of it to avoid error\nin the sciences ) (1674\u201375). It is primarily this text\nwhich provides the basis for Malebranche\u2019s reputation in the\nmodern period. As its full title indicates, the Recherche\nfocuses on the principal sources of human error and on the method for\navoiding those errors and for finding the truth. The first five books\nenumerate the various errors deriving from the senses, imagination,\npure understanding, inclinations and passions, respectively, and a\nsixth book is devoted to the Cartesian method of avoiding such errors\nthrough attention to clear and distinct ideas. The centerpiece of the\nthird book, on pure understanding, is a defense of the claim that the\nideas through which we perceive bodies exist in God. Tucked away in\nthe final book, on method, is a critique of \u201cthe most dangerous\nerror of the ancients,\u201d namely, the Aristotelian position that\nthere are secondary causes in nature distinct from God.\n\nThe first volume of the Recherche, containing the first three\nbooks, drew an immediate response in 1675 from the abb\u00e9 Simon\nFoucher (1644\u20131696), canon of Sainte Chapelle of Dijon. Foucher\nwas an \u201cacademic skeptic\u201d who attacked the assumption that\nideas in us can represent objects distinct from us (see Foucher 1675).\nThe Cartesian Benedictine Robert Desgabets (1610\u20131678) replied\nto Foucher by insisting that the Cartesian rule that clear and\ndistinct ideas are true presupposes that our thoughts correspond to\nreal external objects. In brief prefaces added to the second volume of\nthe Recherche, Malebranche chastised both thinkers for\nfailing to read the work they were discussing, noting in particular\nthat he had explicitly argued in the Recherche that the ideas\nwe perceive exist in God rather than in us.\n\nMalebranche solicited written responses to the Recherche\nmodeled on the sets of objections published with Descartes\u2019s\nMeditations. Perhaps put off by Malebranche\u2019s harsh\ntreatment of Foucher and Desgabets, his critics offered instead only\ninformal objections channeled through mutual friends. In 1678,\nMalebranche appended to the Recherche a set of sixteen\nEclaircissements, or clarifications, that respond to these\nobjections. Among the more important objections addressed are those\nthat concern Malebranche\u2019s assertion that we have a freedom to\n\u201cconsent\u201d to certain motives for action\n(\u201cEclaircissement I\u201d), his claim that reason provides no\nconclusive demonstration of the existence of the material world\n(\u201cEclaircissement VI\u201d), his doctrine of the vision of\nideas in God (\u201cEclaircissement X\u201d), his conclusion that we\nknow our own soul through a confused consciousness rather than through\na clear idea of its nature (\u201cEclaircissement XI\u201d), and his\noccasionalist thesis that God is the only true cause\n(\u201cEclaircissement XV\u201d). The final 1712 edition includes\nthe addition of a seventeenth Eclaircissement that defends the\nimportance \u201cnot only for knowledge of nature but also for\nknowledge of religion and morals\u201d of the view, only hinted at in\nthe initial edition of the Recherche, that God acts for the\nmost part through \u201cgeneral volitions\u201d (volontez\ng\u00e9n\u00e9rales) and acts though \u201cparticular\nvolitions\u201d (volontez particuli\u00e8res) only in the\nexceptional case of miracles.\n\nMalebranche developed this last point in his 1680 Trait\u00e9 de\nla nature et de la gr\u00e2ce (Treatise on Nature and\nGrace). He published this work over the objections of the\nJansenist theologian and Cartesian philosopher Antoine Arnauld\n(1612\u20131694), who was disturbed by what he saw as\nMalebranche\u2019s denial of the assertion in the Scriptures and the\ntradition of God\u2019s attention to particular details in matters of\ngrace. Arnauld responded to the publication of Nature et\ngr\u00e2ce by engaging in open combat, and the ensuing battle\nbecame one of the major intellectual events of the day. His opening\nsalvo was the 1683 Des vraies et des fausses id\u00e9es\n(On True and False Ideas), which attacks not Nature et\ngr\u00e2ce but rather the Recherche (see Arnauld 1683).\nArnauld\u2019s strategy here was to undermine Malebranche\u2019s\ninfluence in theological matters by revealing the inadequacy of his\nphilosophical views. In particular, he attacked Malebranche\u2019s\nassumption that ideas are \u201crepresentative beings\u201d distinct\nfrom our perceptions, offering instead the position, which he\nplausibly ascribed to Descartes, that ideas are simply a feature of\nthe perceptual modifications of our soul. This argument reflects a\nsympathy for Descartes\u2019 views that dates back to Arnauld\u2019s\nset of comments on the Meditations.\n\nThe same year that Arnauld presented his initial critique, Malebranche\npublished the M\u00e9ditations chretiennes et\nm\u00e9taphysiques (Christian and Metaphysical\nMeditations), in which \u201cthe Word\u201d (i.e., the Second\nPerson of the Trinity) offers a summary of his system that highlights\nthe central role that God plays in both metaphysics and morality. This\nwork was in some ways a follow up to his Conversations\nchr\u00e9tiennes (Christian Conversations), published\nin 1677. In that earlier text, Malebranche presented a defense of the\nChristian religion that emphasizes the Augustinian theme of our\ndependence on God for knowledge and happiness. In 1684, Malebranche\nfurther developed his views on moral theory in the Trait\u00e9\nde morale (Treatise on Ethics), in which he argued that\nmoral virtue requires a love of the \u201cimmutable order\u201d that\nGod reveals to those who seek to know it.\n\nIn 1684, Malebranche also responded to Arnauld\u2019s\nId\u00e9es, and after a further exchange on the topic of\nthe nature of ideas the debate turned to the theological issues\nconcerning divine providence, grace and miracles. The battle became\nincreasingly bitter, and as a result of a campaign on the part of\nArnauld and his supporters, Malebranche\u2019s Nature et\ngr\u00e2ce was put on the Catholic Index librorum\nprohibitorum (Index of Prohibited Books) in 1690 (the\nRecherche was added in 1709). The Malebranche-Arnauld polemic\ncontinued even after Arnauld\u2019s death in 1694, with the\npublication in 1704 of Malebranche\u2019s responses to earlier\nletters from Arnauld.\n\nIn 1688, Malebranche published his Entretiens sur la\nm\u00e9taphysique et la religion (Dialogues on Metaphysics\nand Religion), a concise summary of his main metaphysical\ndoctrines of the vision in God and occasionalism that also addresses\nthe problem of evil. In 1696, he appended to this text the\nEntretiens sur la mort (Dialogues on Death), which\nhe composed after a life-threatening illness.\n\nIn 1692, Malebranche published a short study, the Lois de la\ncommunication des mouvements (Laws of the Communication of\nMotions), in which he endorsed Descartes\u2019s law of the\nconservation of the quantity of motion but offered rules governing\ncollision that, unlike Descartes\u2019s own rules, involve no appeal\nto a force in bodies to remain at rest. In correspondence with\nMalebranche, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646\u20131716) emphasized\ndifficulties with Descartes\u2019s conservation law, and that\ncorrespondence led Malebranche to insert into a 1700 edition of the\nLois the admission that experience reveals that such a law\ndoes not hold.\n\nIn 1693, Malebranche responded to the criticisms of the\nRecherche in the 1690 Syst\u00eame de philosophie\n(System of Philosophy) of the French Cartesian Pierre-Sylvain\nR\u00e9gis (1632\u20131707). R\u00e9gis had defended an account\nof ideas similar to the one that Arnauld had defended against\nMalebranche during the 1680s, and Arnauld used the\nR\u00e9gis-Malebranche exchange as an occasion to return to the\nissue of ideas during the last year of his life. Despite their\ndispute, Malebranche and R\u00e9gis were both appointed as honorary\nmembers of the Paris Acad\u00e9mie des sciences when it was\nreorganized in 1699. Malebranche presented an inaugural lecture to the\nAcad\u00e9mie that defends against Descartes an account of color in\nterms of the frequency of vibrations of light. In later published\nversions of the lecture, Malebranche revised his discussion to take\ninto account the theory of the nature of color in the work of Sir\nIsaac Newton.\n\nIn 1697, Malebranche published the Trait\u00e9 de l\u2019amour\nde Dieu (Treatise on the Love of God) with Trois\nlettres \u00e0 Lamy (Three Letters to Lamy), in which\nhe rejected the claim in the Benedictine Fran\u00e7ois Lamy\n(1636\u20131711) that the Trait\u00e9 de morale supports\nthe \u201cquietist\u201d position that moral action derives from a\ndisinterested \u201cpure love of God.\u201d This rejection of\nLamy\u2019s quietism provided the basis for Malebranche\u2019s\nreconciliation with the famous French cleric, Jacques-B\u00e9nigne\nBossuet (1627\u20131704). Bossuet had earlier enlisted the aid of\nFran\u00e7ois de F\u00e9nelon (1651\u20131715) in writing against\nMalebranche\u2019s occasionalism and his appeals to God\u2019s\n\u201cgeneral will,\u201d but later became a bitter enemy of\nF\u00e9nelon\u2019s quietism.\n\nWith the support of the apostolic vicar in China, Malebranche\npublished in 1708 an Entretien d\u2019un philosophe\nchr\u00e9tien et d\u2019un philosophe chinois, sur\nl\u2019existence et la nature de Dieu (Dialogue between a\nChristian Philosopher and a Chinese Philosopher on the Existence and\nNature of God). A sixth and last edition of the\nRecherche appeared in 1712, and in 1715 Malebranche published\nhis final work, R\u00e9flexions sur la pr\u00e9motion\nphysique (Reflections on Physical Premotion), in which\nhe responded to the claim of the abb\u00e9 Laurent-Fran\u00e7ois\nBoursier (1679\u20131749) that occasionalism leads naturally to the\nThomistic position that God determines our action by means of a\n\u201cphysical premotion.\u201d In his response, Malebranche\ndefended the claim, present from the first edition of the\nRecherche, that our free action involves a\n\u201cconsent\u201d that God does not determine.\n\nThe \u0152uvres compl\u00e8tes de Malebranche [OC], which\nconsists of 20 volumes, is the standard critical edition of\nMalebranche\u2019s writings. In France, Malebranche has always been a\nmajor figure in the history of early modern philosophy, and there is\nan extensive earlier literature on him from this country; see, for\ninstance, Gouhier (1926), Gueroult (1939), Gouhier (1948), Gueroult\n(1955\u201359), Robinet (1955), Rodis-Lewis (1963), and Robinet\n(1965). This is supplemented by the important discussion in\nAlqui\u00e9 (1974), and there is a continuation of substantive\nFrench scholarship on Malebranche in works such as Moreau (1999),\nBardout (1999), Bardout (2000), and Pellegrin (2006). Despite the\nrelative neglect of him in the corresponding Anglophone literature\nduring the earlier part of the twentieth century, Malebranche has\nbecome increasingly popular among English-language scholars more\nrecently. This change is indicated by the presence of recent English\ntranslations of his writings; see Malebranche [DM], [DC], [TE], [DMR],\nand [ST]. More recent book-length studies of Malebranche in English\ninclude McCracken (1983), Jolley (1990), Nadler (1992), Schmaltz\n(1996), Nadler (2000), Pyle (2003), and Peppers-Bates (2009), which\nadd to earlier trail-blazing studies such as Walton (1972) and Radner\n(1978). Easton, Lennon and Sebba (1991) is a comprehensive\nbibliography of work on Malebranche in various languages. This work\nsupersedes the bibliography in volume 20 of Malebranche [OC], which\nhad superseded Sebba (1959).\n2. Ideas and the Vision in God\n\nIn a section of the third book of the Recherche devoted to\n\u201cthe nature of ideas,\u201d Malebranche argues for his famous\ndoctrine of the vision in God. More precisely, the thesis in this\nsection is that we see external objects by means of ideas in God. The\nargument for this thesis begins with the claim at the beginning of\nthis section that \u201ceveryone agrees that we do not perceive\nobjects external to us by themselves\u201d since it can hardly be the\ncase that \u201cthe soul should leave the body to stroll about the\nheavens to see the objects present there\u201d (Malebranche [OC],\n1:413). Arnauld later took exception to this starting point,\ncountering that \u201cideas, taken in the sense of representative\nbeings, distinct from perceptions, are not needed by our soul in order\nto see bodies\u201d (Arnauld 1683, 18). His main objection is that\nMalebranche stacked the deck in favor of his doctrine that we see\nideas of bodies in God by assuming from the start that these ideas are\ndistinct from our own perceptions.\n\nIn developing his own position, Arnauld appeals to Descartes\u2019\ndistinction in \u201cMeditation III\u201d between the formal reality\nof an idea as a perceptual modification of mind and its objective\nreality as something that represents an object. Arnauld insists that a\nrepresentative idea is simply the objective reality of a perception,\nand thus not something distinct from that perception. However, it is\nimportant to note that Malebranche\u2019s definition of an idea does\nnot rule out such a position from the start. As he himself insists to\nArnauld, the claim that we must perceive external objects through\nideas leaves open the question of whether an idea is \u201ca\nmodality of the soul, according to the opinion of M. Arnauld; an\nexpress species, according to certain philosophers, or an\nentity created with the soul, according to others; or finally\nintelligible extension rendered sensible by color or light,\naccording to my opinion\u201d (Malebranche [OC], 6:95).\n\nMalebranche\u2019s description of his own opinion goes beyond what\ncan be found in the original edition of the Recherche.\nHowever, his description of the other alternatives is drawn directly\nfrom this text. In particular, Malebranche had argued there that there\nare only four alternatives to the conclusion that we see bodies\nthrough ideas in God: (1) Bodies transmit resembling species to the\nsoul; (2) Our soul has the power to produce ideas when triggered by\nnon-resembling bodily impression; (3) Ideas are created with the soul\nor produced in it successively by God; and (4) Our soul sees both the\nessence and the existence of bodies by considering its own\nperfections. Malebranche told Arnauld that since this list constitutes\n\u201can exact division \u2026 of all the ways in which we can see\nobjects\u201d and since each of the alternative accounts yields\n\u201cmanifest contradictions,\u201d his argument from elimination\nserves to demonstrate the doctrine of the vision in God (Malebranche\n[OC], 6:198\u201399).\n\nIt is difficult to determine from the Recherche the precise\nsource of the enumeration. However, Connell (1967) has established\nthat Malebranche\u2019s argument was drawn from the account of\nangelic knowledge in the work of the Spanish scholastic, Francisco\nSu\u00e1rez (1548\u20131617). Particularly crucial for\nMalebranche\u2019s enumeration is Su\u00e1rez\u2019s claim that\nangels must know material objects through species that God adds to\ntheir mind given that God alone can know them through His own\nsubstance. In light of this claim, we can take Malebranche\u2019s\nfirst three hypotheses to cover the various ways in which we could\nperceive bodies through immaterial species \u201csuperadded\u201d to\nour soul, and his fourth hypothesis to cover the possibility that we\nperceive bodies in the perfections of our own soul. In arguing against\nthe last hypothesis, Malebranche notes that since a finite being can\nsee in itself neither the infinite nor an infinite number of beings\n(as Su\u00e1rez had argued in the case of angels), and since we in\nfact perceive both the infinite and infinity in external objects, it\nmust be that we see these objects by means of perfections contained in\nthe only being that can possess an infinity of ideas, namely, God\nHimself.\n\nMalebranche takes the conclusion here to confirm the view in \u201can\ninfinity of passages\u201d in Augustine that \u201cwe see God\u201d\nin knowing eternal truths. This appeal to the Augustinian theory of\ndivine illumination provides the basis for an argument for the vision\nin God that bypasses the unusual enumeration in the\nRecherche. This more direct argument is introduced in\n\u201cEclaircissement X,\u201d where Malebranche urges that the\nideas we perceive must exist in an \u201cimmutable and necessary\nReason\u201d since they are themselves immutable and necessary\n(Malebranche [OC], 3:129f). Malebranche emphasizes that the\nAugustinian view that eternal truths derive from uncreated features of\nthe divine intellect conflicts directly with the voluntarist\nconclusion in Descartes that these truths derive rather from\nGod\u2019s free and indifferent will. Particularly in his exchanges\nwith Arnauld, Malebranche attempts to present his doctrine of the\nvision in God as a natural consequence of Descartes\u2019 account of\nideas. However, his Augustinian argument serves to show that Descartes\nhimself could not have accepted this doctrine. Moreover, such an\nargument reveals the most fundamental reason for Malebranche\u2019s\nrejection of Arnauld\u2019s Cartesian identification of ideas with\nour own perceptions. Since Malebranche identifies these ideas with\nnecessary and immutable essences, and since he holds that these ideas\nderive their necessity and immutability from the divine intellect, he\nconcludes that Arnauld\u2019s position can only result in a radical\nsubjectivism that renders impossible any sort of a priori knowledge of\nthe material world.\n\n\u201cEclaircissement X\u201d also introduces the notion of\n\u201cintelligible extension\u201d mentioned in Malebranche\u2019s\nclaim to Arnauld quoted above concerning his own opinion. According to\nthis Eclaircissement, God has a single ideal extension that serves to\nrepresent particular bodies to Him. Arnauld objects that this position\ninvolves a retraction of the claim in the Recherche that we\nperceive bodies by means of distinct ideas in God. In response,\nMalebranche insists that his view all along was that God represents\nparticular bodies by means of His own simple \u201cabsolute\nbeing.\u201d For Arnauld, however, the view that God contains\nextension in this way is objectionable since it is connected to the\nheretical view in the work of the Dutch thinker Benedict Spinoza that\nGod is extended substance. The charge of Spinozism reappears in\nMalebranche\u2019s 1713\u201314 correspondence with one of his\nformer students, J.J. Dortous de Mairan (1678\u20131771), who later\nbecame the Secretary of the Acad\u00e9mie des sciences. As in the\ncase of Arnauld, so in this correspondence Malebranche vigorously\ndenies this charge. In both cases, he responds by emphasizing that the\ninfinite and indivisible ideal extension that exists in God differs\nfrom the finite and divisible extension in the material world. (For\nmore on Malebranche\u2019s notion of intelligible extension, see Reid\n2003; cf. the different interpretation of this notion in Nolan\n2012.)\n\nA final feature of Malebranche\u2019s doctrine of the vision in God\nis connected to the notion in his writings of the \u201cefficacious\nidea\u201d (id\u00e9e efficace). As first noted in Robinet\n(1965), this notion became entrenched in Malebranche\u2019s system\naround 1695, after his encounter with his Cartesian critic\nR\u00e9gis. In his Syst\u00eame de philosophie,\nR\u00e9gis had challenged the claim in the preface to the\nRecherche that our mind is united to God in a manner that\n\u201craises the mind above all things\u201d and is the source of\n\u201cits life, its light, and its entire felicity\u201d\n(Malebranche [OC], 1:9). While he grants the commonplace claim that\nGod must create and conserve our soul, R\u00e9gis denies that we are\nenlightened by means of a union with ideas of bodies in God. Rather,\nhe insists that God conserves in us ideas that derive directly from\nthe bodies they represent. In the 1693 R\u00e9ponse \u00e0\nR\u00e9gis (Response to R\u00e9gis), Malebranche\nemphasizes his Augustinian position that we can be instructed as to\nthe nature of bodies only through a union with God. However, he puts a\nnew spin on this position when he notes that the union with God\ninvolves an \u201caffecting\u201d or \u201ctouching\u201d of our\nmind by God\u2019s idea of extension.\n\nAlready in the 1688 Entretiens sur la m\u00e9taphysique,\nMalebranche had suggested that the union with God can be explicated in\nterms of a causal relation between God\u2019s ideas and our mind.\nAfter 1695, he develops this suggestion by introducing the notion of\n\u201cpure\u201d or non-sensory intellectual perceptions that are\nproduced by God\u2019s efficacious idea of extension. Yet he also\nstresses in this later period that such an idea is the causal source\nof our sensations. One advantage of this extension of the doctrine of\nefficacious ideas to sensations is that it yields a fairly clear\nexplanation of Malebranche\u2019s claim to Arnauld that an idea is\n\u201cintelligible extension rendered sensible by color or\nlight.\u201d Prior to 1695, Malebranche explained how intelligible\nextension is so rendered by appealing somewhat obscurely to the fact\nthat the soul \u201cattaches\u201d colors to a non-sensory idea.\nHowever, the theory of efficacious ideas allowed him to say that this\nidea is rendered sensible by causing in us the appropriate sensations\nof color and light. The claim that we see ideas in God is thus\ntransformed into the claim that our soul has intellectual and sensory\nperceptions that yield an understanding of the truth concerning bodies\nin virtue of their causal relation to God\u2019s idea of extension.\nDrawing on Robinet\u2019s results, one scholar has concluded that\nwhile Malebranche started with the vision in God, he ended\nwith a vision by God (Alqui\u00e9 1974, 209).\n3. Cartesian Dualism\n\nMalebranche tells Arnauld that it was Augustine\u2019s authority\n\u201cwhich has given me the desire to put forth the new\nphilosophy of ideas\u201d (Malebranche [OC], 6:80). By contrast,\nhe emphasizes in the preface of the Recherche that Augustine\nhad failed to see that sensible qualities \u201care not clearly\ncontained in the idea we have of matter,\u201d adding that \u201cthe\ndifference between mind and body has been known with sufficient\nclarity for only a few years\u201d (Malebranche [OC], 1:20). The\nallusion here is to Descartes\u2019s recent discovery of an idea of\nmatter that reveals that its nature consists in extension alone. This\nidea dictates that sensible qualities such as colors, tastes and odors\nthat are not reducible to modes of extension cannot exist external to\nmind. But since these qualities exist in the mind, and in particular\nin the mind\u2019s perception of the qualities, the mind itself must\nbe distinguished from body. In this way the Cartesian idea of matter\nreveals \u201cthe difference between mind and body.\u201d\n\nIn the initial book of the Recherche, on the senses,\nMalebranche proposes that the erroneous belief in the Aristotelians as\nwell as in Augustine that sensible qualities exist in bodies has its\nsource in a misuse of \u201cnatural judgments\u201d that help in the\nconservation of the human body. Here he is following Descartes\u2019\naccount in \u201cMeditation VI\u201d of the \u201cteachings of\nnature,\u201d and in particular the claim there that the purpose of\nsensations is not to teach us about the nature of bodies but simply to\ninform us of what is beneficial or harmful to the human composite.\nJust as Descartes had urged that erroneous beliefs about the nature of\nbody can be avoided by attending to the clear and distinct perceptions\nof the intellect, so Malebranche counseles that we avoid error by\nattending to what the clear idea of matter reveals to us about the\nnature of body. As we have seen, Malebranche has Augustinian reasons\nfor saying that the idea that so instructs us exists in God. By his\nown admission, however, the conclusion that the idea that instructs us\nis an idea of extension derives from the recent discoveries\nof Descartes.\n\nMalebranche emphasizes that the clear idea of extension must be\ndistinguished from our confused sensations. One point he wants to make\nis that the idea exists in God while the sensations are only\nmodifications of our mind. However, his emphasis on the fact that this\nidea is \u201cpure\u201d or non-sensory indicates that our\nexperience of the material world has an intellectual component. We\nhave seen that his late doctrine of the efficacious idea involved the\nposition that we have pure intellectual perceptions produced by\nGod\u2019s intellectual idea of extension. But his mature position\nthat this idea is also the cause of our sensations allows for the\nclaim that our most basic sensory contact with the material world has\nan intellectual component.\n\nWe know that Malebranche\u2019s doctrine of the vision in God\nconflicts with Descartes\u2019 doctrine of the creation of the\neternal truths. However, there are further departures from orthodox\nCartesianism that are linked to two qualifications of this doctrine.\nThe first qualification is that God\u2019s idea of extension can\nreveal only the nature of bodies and not their existence. This\nqualification is not explicit in the initial edition of the\nRecherche, which says only that the existence of properties\nof bodies external to us is \u201cvery difficult to prove\u201d\n(Malebranche [OC], 1:122). Foucher had objected that Malebranche has\nno good reason to affirm the external existence of these properties.\nIn \u201cEclaircissement VI,\u201d Malebranche urges that the idea\nof extension does reveal the possible existence of the material world,\nand that Descartes has shown that we have a probable argument for its\nactual existence deriving from our natural propensity to believe that\nthere are bodies. However, he concedes in this text\u2014without\ncrediting Foucher\u2014that neither he nor Descartes can provide an\nargument from reason that demonstrates \u201cwith evidence\u201d or\n\u201cwith geometric rigor\u201d that this belief is true. His\nconclusion is that such an argument must appeal to faith in the\nveracity of the report in the Scriptures that God has created the\nheavens and the earth.\n\nAccording to the second qualification of the vision in God\u2014which\nis found in the original edition of the Recherche\u2014we\nperceive the nature of our soul not through a clear idea in God, but\nonly through a confused \u201cconsciousness or inner sensation\u201d\n(conscience ou sentiment int\u00e9rieur). Malebranche\naccepts the Cartesian commonplace that consciousness reveals\nimmediately the existence of the soul. He allows that we know the\nnature of our soul to consist in thought, moreover, and he embraces\nthe Cartesian conclusion that the soul as a thinking thing is distinct\nfrom body as an extended thing. Yet he insists that we know that the\nsoul is distinct from the body not by means of any direct insight into\nthe nature of thought, but rather by seeing that thought is not\ncontained in the idea of matter. More generally, Malebranche claims\nthat our lack of access to a clear idea of the soul is evident from\nthe fact that we do not have knowledge of thought that matches our\nknowledge of the mathematical features of bodies. This last point\nturns on its head Descartes\u2019 own conclusion in \u201cMeditation\nII\u201d that the nature of the human mind is \u201cbetter\nknown\u201d than the nature of body; for Malebranche, it is the\nnature of body that is better known than the nature of mind.\n\nIn \u201cEclaircissement XI,\u201d Malebranche attempts to counter\n\u201cthe authority of Descartes\u201d by arguing that the\nCartesians themselves must admit that they have only a confused\nawareness of the nature of the sensory modifications of the soul. He\nnotes that while the intellectual idea allows the various modes of\nextension to be related in a precise manner, there is no clear scale\non which we can order our sensations of different shades of the same\ncolor, not to mention our sensations of sensible qualities of\ndifferent kinds. Malebranche takes the confusion in the sensations to\nreveal a confusion in our perception of the nature of the soul. He\nadds that Cartesians can discern that sensible qualities are\nmodifications of an immaterial soul only by seeing that they are\n\u201cnot clearly contained in the idea we have of matter.\u201d For\na discussion sympathetic to Malebranche\u2019s critique of\nDescartes\u2019s account of our knowledge of mind, see Schmaltz\n(1996); for more recent discussions that defend Descartes against this\ncritique, see Nolan and Whipple (2005) and LoLorodo (2005).\n4. Occasionalism\n\nMalebranche is known for his occasionalism, that is, his doctrine that\nGod is the only causal agent, and that creatures merely provide the\n\u201coccasion\u201d for divine action. On the old textbook account,\noccasionalism was an ad hoc response to the purported problem\nin Descartes of how substances as distinct in nature as mind and body\nare can causally interact (see, for instance, Copleston 1958, 176, and\nKeeling 1968, 224). According to this account, Malebranche was driven\nby this problem with Cartesian dualism to propose that it is God who\nbrings it about that our sensations and volitions are correlated with\nmotions in our body.\n\nHowever, occasionalism was already an old doctrine at the time that\nThomas Aquinas (1225\u20131274) wrote against it. (There is a helpful\nsurvey, in German, of the earlier history of occasionalism in Perler\nand Rudolph 2000.) Thomas indicated that the primary concern of the\noccasionalists was to strengthen the assertion of God\u2019s\nomnipotence. Though he allowed that God must \u201cconcur\u201d with\ncreatures in producing effects, Thomas also claimed that there is\nreason to conclude that creatures are true secondary causes. For\ninstance, he urged that it is more in accord with divine greatness to\nsay that God communicates His power to creatures. Moreover, he claimed\nthat it is simply evident to the senses that creatures have the power\nto bring about effects. Thomas also argued that if there were no\nnatures in creatures that explain effects, there could be no true\nscientific explanation of effects through their natural causes.\n\nMalebranche was concerned to respond to all of these arguments against\noccasionalism, particularly as they were developed in the work of\nscholastics such as Su\u00e1rez. Against the first point that\nGod\u2019s greatness requires the communication of His power, he\ncountered that it is in fact idolatrous to attribute divine power to\ncreatures. Malebranche\u2019s argument that God alone can produce\neffects relies on the assumption that \u201ca true cause \u2026 is\none such that the mind perceives a necessary connection [liaison\nn\u00e9cessaire] between it and its effects\u201d (Malebranche\n[OC], 2:316). He claims that there is such a connection neither among\nbodily states, nor between bodily and mental states, nor among mental\nstates. In all of these cases, one can deny the connections without\ncontradiction. There can be a necessary causal connection in only one\ncase, namely, the connection between the volitions of an omnipotent\nagent and its upshots. Thus, only such an agent, namely, God, can be a\ntrue cause. (For different interpretations of this argument, cf. Lee\n2008 and Ott 2008).\n\nIn the Entretiens sur la m\u00e9taphysique, Malebranche\noffers a different argument based on Descartes\u2019s suggestion in\n\u201cMeditation III\u201d that God conserves the world by\ncontinuously creating it. The argument begins with the claim that God\nmust create bodies in some particular place and in determinate\nrelations of distance to other bodies. If God conserves a body by\ncreating it in the same place from moment to moment, that body remains\nat rest, and if he conserves it by creating it in different places\nfrom moment to moment, it is in motion. We cannot even create motion\nin our own bodies. Rather, it is God who must produce it on the\noccasion of volitional states. Moreover, it is not motions in our\nbrain that cause our sensory states, but God who produces them on the\noccasion of the presence of such motions. Finally, I have indicated\nthe view in the Entretiens that God produces our intellectual\nstates through the union of our mind with His \u201cintelligible\nextension.\u201d While the argument from the necessity of the causal\nconnection yields the result that only an omnipotent being can be a\ncause, the argument here is that only that being which\ncreates/conserves the world can cause various bodily and mental\nstates. However, both arguments converge on the conclusion, which\nMalebranche claims to find in Augustine, that all creatures depend\nentirely on God. (For further discussion of Malebranche\u2019s\nvarious arguments for occasionalism, see Lee 2007 and Lee 2008.)\n\nThe second scholastic argument against occasionalism appeals to the\npurported fact that it is evident to the senses that creatures have\ncausal power. For Malebranche, however, this argument is no more\npersuasive than the argument that bodies must have colors and tastes\nsince our senses tell us that they do. As indicated above, Malebranche\noffers Cartesian grounds for thinking that the purpose of our\nsensations is not to reveal the true nature of the material world, but\nrather to indicate what is helpful or harmful to our body. Malebranche\nheld that our attribution of causal powers to bodies manifests in\nparticular an attachment to the body that is an effect of original\nsin. Due to this attachment, we take objects in the material world to\nbe a cause of our happiness rather than God.\n\nIn \u201cEclaircissement XV,\u201d Malebranche responds to the\nscholastic point that occasionalism renders scientific explanation\nimpossible by appealing to the fact that God is not an arbitrary\nagent, but acts in accord with His wisdom. This wisdom dictates that\nHe act \u201calmost always\u201d by means of a \u201cgeneral and\nefficacious will.\u201d Such a will produces effects that are\nperfectly law-like. For instance, God acts by a general will in\nproducing changes in bodies in accord with the law of the\ncommunication of motion. Malebranche did allow that God can produce\nmiracles by \u201cparticular volitions\u201d that are not law-like.\nHowever, he emphasizes that there are relatively few such volitions in\nGod. Thus, we can offer scientific explanations that appeal to the\nlaws of motion that reflect the nature of God\u2019s general\nwill.\n\nThe appeal to God\u2019s general will is relevant to a non-scholastic\nobjection to Malebranche\u2019s occasionalism from his contemporary\nGottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646\u20131716). In his Syst\u00e8me\nnouveau (1695), Leibniz agrees with Malebranche that \u201cin\nmetaphysical rigor\u201d created substances cannot be said to\ninteract, but he rejects Malebranche\u2019s appeal to God to explain\nthis apparent interaction on the grounds that such an appeal invokes a\nDeus ex machina and thus involves a \u201crecourse to a\nmiracle\u201d (Leibniz 1997, 17). In the entry on Rorarius in the\nfirst edition of his Dictionnaire historique et critique\n(1697), Pierre Bayle (1647\u20131706) protests on Malebranche\u2019s\nbehalf that since God produces the interactions between mind and body\n\u201conly according to general laws, in doing so he never acts\nextraordinarily\u201d (Leibniz 1997, 74). In a 1698 letter to Bayle,\nLeibniz responds that the mere fact that Malebranche takes God to act\nin nature according to general laws does not suffice to show that his\noccasionalism does not involve an appeal to a perpetual miracle.\nLeibniz explains that insofar as a miracle derives from\n\u201csomething which exceeds the power of created things,\u201d\nanything that God produces directly without any causal contribution\nfrom created natures counts as miraculous (Leibniz 1997, 82). \n\nA further objection to Malebranche\u2019s occasionalism from one of\nhis contemporaries is found in the work of Bernard le Bovier de\nFontenelle (1657\u20131757), the eventual perpetual secretary of the\nParis Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences. In his 1686 Doutes sur le\nsyst\u00e8me physique des causes occasionelles, Fontenelle\nargues that Malebranche\u2019s mechanistic physics is incompatible\nwith his occasionalism. This is so because according to mechanism,\nbodily collision necessitates change in motion. But then bodily\ncollision satisfies Malebranche\u2019s main requirement for being a\ntrue cause insofar as it has a necessary connection to its effect;\nthus the conflict with occasionalism. In his 1688 Entretien sur la\nm\u00e9taphysique, Malebranche offers the response that the\nlaws governing the bodily effects of collision derive from God\u2019s\nwill rather than from the nature of bodies (Malebranche [OC], 12:164).\nFor different assessments of this response to Fontenelle, cf. Downing\n(2005) and Schmaltz (2008).\n\nMalebranche was not the first Cartesian to endorse occasionalism.\nThere were followers of Descartes such as Louis de la Forge\n(1632\u20131666) and Claude Clerselier (1614\u20131684) who stressed\nthat God must be the cause of the communication of motion in bodily\ncollisions given the passivity of Cartesian matter. Clerselier in\nparticular attempted to preserve some room for the action of finite\nminds on bodies, but the Cartesian Geraud de Cordemoy\n(1626\u20131684) went further in claiming that only God can cause\nchanges in the material world. However, none of these thinkers went as\nfar as Malebranche in arguing explicitly that God must produce all\nreal changes in nature. Moreover, Malebranche is distinctive in\nproviding an explanation of God\u2019s action that distinguishes His\ngeneral will from His particular volitions. For a recent discussion of\nissues connected to Malebranche\u2019s notion of particular\nvolitions, see Walsh and Stencil (2016).\n5. Theodicy\n\nThe presence of various evils in the world is problematic for anyone\nwho claims that this world was created by a God who has infinite\npower, knowledge and goodness. However, the problem is particularly\nacute for an occasionalist such as Malebranche who holds that God is\nthe only true cause of effects in nature. Malebranche offers a\ntheodicy that addresses the problem of evil by emphasizing that in the\n\u201corder of nature\u201d God acts for the most part through His\ngeneral will. In Nature et gr\u00e2ce, he starts by\nadmitting that God could have acted by particular volitions to prevent\nnatural evils such as malformed offspring (a fitting example given his\nown malformed spine), and thus could have produced a more perfect\nworld than He actually did create. In correspondence with Leibniz,\nMalebranche emphasizes this point in distinguishing his theodicy from\nLeibniz\u2019s (see Schmaltz 2010). However, Malebranche also claims\nthat God could have created a more perfect world only by departing\nfrom simple laws, thereby sacrificing the simplicity and uniformity of\naction that is a supreme mark of His wisdom. God produces the natural\nevils that follow from simple laws not because He wills those\nparticular effects, but because He wills a world that best reflects\nHis wisdom by possessing the most effects governed by the fewest\nlaws.\n\nIn his R\u00e9flexions on Malebranche\u2019s Nature et\ngr\u00e2ce, Arnauld objects to what he took to be the suggestion\nin his target text that God has concern only for general features of\nthe world and does not will the details of His effects. For Arnauld,\ndivine providence requires that God intend all of the particularities\nof the world He creates. In the recent Anglophone literature, there is\na debate over whether Arnauld\u2019s critique is based on a proper\ninterpretation of Malebranche. This debate was promoted by the claim\nin Nadler (1993) that when Malebranche says that God acts by means of\ngeneral laws or volitions, he means only that God has volitions in\naccord with general laws, and that his doctrine of God\u2019s\ncontinual creation in the Entretiens sur la\nm\u00e9taphysique in fact requires distinct volitions for\ndistinct effects (cf. the development of this interpretation in Pessin\n2001 and Stencil 2011). Other commentators have countered that Arnauld\nwas correct in thinking that Malebranche\u2019s claim in Nature\net gr\u00e2ce that God acts by relatively few general volitions\ninvolves a rejection of the position that He has volitions for each\nparticular effect. Some evidence for this view is provided by the fact\nthat Malebranche emphasizes that the laws themselves are\n\u201cefficacious,\u201d and that God employs relatively few\nvolitions in producing effects in the order of nature (see Black 1997,\nJolley 2002, and Schmaltz 2003).\n\nMalebranche insists that God\u2019s general will is operative not\nonly in the order of nature, but also in the \u201corder of\ngrace.\u201d However, he notes that the production of effects in the\nlatter order also involves human action that is free in the strong\nsense of not being determined by anything external to the agent. His\nappeal to this sort of freedom is in fact central to his solution to\nthe problem of moral evil, that is, the compatibility of sin with\nGod\u2019s goodness. According to Malebranche, God is not responsible\nfor sinful action since such action derives not from Him but from\nsinful agents. Arnauld objects that this solution is \u201cmore\npelagian than anything in Pelagius,\u201d and that one must side with\nAugustine, who declared Pelagianism a heresy. Malebranche responds\nthat he did not follow Pelagius in denying the importance of grace,\nand that Augustine himself had emphasized our freedom in action.\n\nMalebranche also holds that it is obvious by \u201cinner\nsensation\u201d that we are genuinely free. However, there is some\nquestion whether this introspective report is compatible with\nMalebranche\u2019s occasionalist claim that God is the only real\ncause. This question has generated considerable discussion in the\nrecent Anglophone literature (cf. Schmaltz 2005, Greenberg 2008 and\n2015, and Peppers-Bates 2009). Malebranche does allow that God alone\nis the cause of our inclination to love \u201cthe good in\ngeneral.\u201d However, he also insists that we are free to\n\u201cconsent\u201d to the stopping of that inclination at a\nparticular object other than God. Such consent results in an\n\u201cabsolute and intrinsic\u201d love of that object that is\nsinful given that this love is worthy only of God. The consent is free\nbecause one is always able to suspend consent and to search for\nobjects more worthy of our love.\n\nThere is the claim that Malebranche\u2019s account of consent\nremained essentially the same over the course of his philosophical\ncareer (see Kremer 2000, 206). However, there is some reason to think\nthat this account in fact was subject to significant development. In\nthe initial discussion of freedom in the Recherche, there is\nthe suggestion that consent consists in our\n\u201cdetermination\u201d of our natural inclination toward the good\nin general (Malebranche [OC], 1:46). However, this suggestion\nconflicts with the claim in the very same text that it is God who\ndirects our natural inclination toward particular objects prior to any\nfree act on our part. Indeed, in his later discussion of freedom in\n\u201cEclaircissement I,\u201d Malebranche held that our freedom\nconsists not in an active turning of our natural inclination, but\nrather in the inactivity of our resting with a particular good\n(Malebranche [OC], 3:548). This view is further developed in the\nTrait\u00e9 de morale, which in the case of free action\ndistinguishes between the force involved in the search for\ntruth and the libert\u00e9 that directs this search. Free\nacts of consent fall under the latter, whereas the former involves the\ndispositions of our free inclinations that God produces in us on the\noccasion of these acts (Malebranche [OC], 11:70). In contrast to his\nearlier suggestion that our free acts involve either a turning of our\nnatural inclination or an inactivity coupled with such an inclination,\nMalebranche\u2019s view here is that such acts are inactivities\ncoupled with a distinct sort of free inclination. There are different\nanswers to the question of whether this account serves to reconcile\nMalebranche\u2019s occasionalism with his claim that we have genuine\nfreedom of action; cf. Schmaltz (2005), which defends the coherence of\nMalebranche\u2019s final position on this issue (in line with the\nearlier view in Laporte 1951), and Greenberg (2015), which argues that\nthis position is not fully consistent.\n6. Moral Theory\n\nThe theocentrism that is evident in Malebranche\u2019s doctrines of\nthe vision in God and occasionalism would lead us to expect that God\nplays a central role in his moral theory. This expectation is borne\nout by his discussion in the Trait\u00e9 de morale. Indeed,\nMalebranche\u2019s two doctrines are present in that work. The vision\nin God is reflected in the insistence there that moral duties are\ndictated by \u201crelations of perfection\u201d revealed in\nGod\u2019s wisdom. As in the case of necessary truths concerning\nbody, so in the case of moral truths Malebranche unequivocally rejects\nCartesian voluntarism. The doctrine of occasionalism is reflected in\nMalebranche\u2019s insistence that God is our greatest good since He\nalone can cause our happiness. This point indicates that Malebranche\ntakes moral action to require a consideration not only of abstract\nrelations of perfection, but also the happiness of the self.\n\nMalebranche starts from the Augustinian position that morality\nconcerns the proper ordering of our love. Given the importance of\nhuman freedom for his theodicy, it is not surprising that Malebranche\ninsists that the love required for moral action involve the free\nexercise of the will. His version of the \u201cgood will\u201d is\none that freely strives to be guided in action by objective relations\nof perfection that hold among the various objects of love. God is the\nmost perfect being, and hence the most worthy of our love, while human\nbeings are more perfect than mere material beings, and thus more\nworthy of our love. When the intensity of our love matches the order\namong perfections, we have a right love that provides the basis for\nvirtue, that is, a habitual inclination to love objects according to\ntheir perfections.\n\nMalebranche holds that due to original sin, we are inclined not to\nright love directed by our perception of relations of perfection in\nGod\u2019s wisdom, but rather to a disordered love directed by bodily\npleasures deriving from the soul-body union. This is the counterpart\nto the disordered inclination of our will to make judgments about the\nnature of the material world that are based on sensations deriving\nfrom the union. For Malebranche, a corrective to both of these\ndisorders of the will is to attend to clear ideas that exist in\nGod.\n\nMalebranche sometimes suggested that disordered love of bodily\npleasure derives from self-love. Encouraged by this suggestion, one of\nhis followers, Fran\u00e7ois Lamy, claimed that his position leads\nto the quietist view in F\u00e9n\u00e9lon that moral conduct\nrequires a \u201cpure love of God\u201d that involves no concern for\nthe self or its pleasure. This position, which Lamy himself endorsed,\nwas later condemned by the Catholic Church, due in large part to a\ncampaign against F\u00e9n\u00e9lon directed by his critic,\nBossuet. But Malebranche insists that such a position directly\nconflicts with his own view that pleasure itself is a good that is\nrequired as a motive for action. When critics such as Arnauld and\nR\u00e9gis charge that this view results in hedonism, Malebranche\nresponds that it is only ordered pleasures that bring the greatest\ngood. This response is reflected in his claim to Lamy that a\ndisordered love of self is to be contrasted not with pure love of God,\nbut rather with an ordered love that seeks happiness in the\ncontemplation of the greatest good, God. In emphasizing the need for\nthis sort of love of God, Malebranche was returning to his view in the\npreface to the Recherche that it is through a union with God\nthat the mind \u201creceives its life, its light, and its entire\nfelicity.\u201d For more on Malebranche\u2019s engagement with\nquietism, see Montcheuil (1947). But cf. the critical evaluation of\nMontcheuil\u2019s decidedly pro-Malebranche view of this exchange\nwith Lamy in Dreyfus (1958), 318\u201322. There is a recent\ndiscussion of the relation of Malebranche to quietism in Walsh and\nLennon (2012).\n\nBardout (2000), 111\u201362, includes the argument that\nMalebranche\u2019s exchange with Lamy on pure love in fact marks a\ntransition in his thought from a \u201cmetaphysical morality\u201d\nthat stresses the purely intelligible nature of our moral end, to a\n\u201csensible morality\u201d that stresses a conception of that end\nin terms of the cause of our pleasure. However, this shift may not be\nas dramatic as in the case of Malebranche\u2019s conception of\nfreedom. For the view that God is our sole good insofar as He is the\nsole cause of our pleasure is present already in the first edition of\nthe Recherche (Malebranche [OC], 172\u201373).
