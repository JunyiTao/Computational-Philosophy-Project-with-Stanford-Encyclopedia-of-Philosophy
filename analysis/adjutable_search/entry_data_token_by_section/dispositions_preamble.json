    "main_text": "\n\nA glass has certain dispositions, for example the\ndisposition to shatter when struck. But what is this disposition? It\nseems on the one hand to be a perfectly real property, a genuine\nrespect of similarity common to glasses, china cups, and anything else\nfragile. Yet on the other hand, the glass\u2019s disposition seems\nmysterious, \u2018ethereal\u2019 (as Goodman (1954) put it) in a way\nthat, say, its size and shape are not. For its disposition, it seems,\nhas to do only with its possibly shattering in\ncertain conditions. In general, it seems that nothing about\nthe actual behaviour of an object is ever necessary\nfor it to have the dispositions it has. Many objects differ from one\nanother with respect to their dispositions in virtue of their merely\npossible behaviours, and this is a mysterious way for objects to\ndiffer.\n\nMuch of the recent work on the topic of dispositions has been focused\non attempts to dispel this mystery by explaining dispositions in\nother, more readily understandable terms. The topic of dispositions is\ninteresting in its own right. But it derives further interest from the\nfact that appeals to dispositions have been made in just about every\narea of philosophy. There are explicitly dispositional analyses, for\nexample, of mental states, of colours, of value, of properties, and of\nconditionals. Philosophers interested in just about anything should be\ninterested in dispositions.\n",
