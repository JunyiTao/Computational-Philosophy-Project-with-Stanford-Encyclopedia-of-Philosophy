    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\n\nThe Theaetetus, which probably dates from about 369 BC, is\narguably Plato\u2019s greatest work on epistemology. (Arguably, it is his\ngreatest work on anything.) Plato (c.427\u2013347 BC) has much to say about\nthe nature of knowledge elsewhere. But only the Theaetetus\noffers a set-piece discussion of the question \u201cWhat is\nknowledge?\u201d\n\n\nLike many other Platonic dialogues, the Theaetetus is\ndominated by question-and-answer exchanges, with Socrates as main\nquestioner. His two respondents are Theaetetus, a brilliant young\nmathematician, and Theaetetus\u2019 tutor Theodorus, who is rather less\nyoung (and rather less brilliant).\n\n\nAlso like other Platonic dialogues, the main discussion of the\nTheaetetus is set within a framing conversation (142a\u2013143c)\nbetween Eucleides and Terpsion (cp. Phaedo 59c). This frame\nmay be meant as a dedication of the work to the memory of the\nman Theaetetus. Sedley 2004 (6\u20138) has argued that it is meant to set\nsome distance between Plato\u2019s authorial voice and the various other\nvoices (including Socrates\u2019) that are heard in the dialogue.\nAlternatively, or also, it may be intended, like Symposium\n172\u20133, to prompt questions about the reliability of knowledge based on\ntestimony. (Cp. the law-court passage (Theaetetus 201a\u2013c),\nand Socrates\u2019 dream (Theaetetus 201c\u2013202c).)\n\n\nThe Theaetetus\u2019 most important similarity to other\nPlatonic dialogues is that it is aporetic\u2014it is a\ndialogue that ends in an impasse. The Theaetetus\nreviews three definitions of knowledge in turn; plus, in a preliminary\ndiscussion, one would-be definition which, it is said, does not really\ncount. Each of these proposals is rejected, and no alternative is\nexplicitly offered. Thus we complete the dialogue without discovering\nwhat knowledge is. We discover only three things that knowledge is\nnot (Theaetetus 210c; cp. 183a5,\n187a1).\n\n\nThis matters, given the place that the Theaetetus is normally\nassigned in the chronology of Plato\u2019s writings. Most scholars agree\nthat Plato\u2019s first writings were the \u201cSocratic\u201d dialogues\n(as they are often called), which ask questions of the \u201cWhat\nis\u2026?\u201d form and typically fail to find answers:\n\u201cWhat is courage?\u201d (Laches), \u201cWhat is\nself-control?\u201d (Charmides), \u201cWhat is\njustice?\u201d (Alcibiades I; Republic 1),\n\u201cWhat is holiness?\u201d (Euthyphro), \u201cWhat is\nfriendship?\u201d (Lysis), \u201cWhat is virtue?\u201d\n(Meno), \u201cWhat is nobility?\u201d (Hippias\nMajor).  After some transitional works (Protagoras, Gorgias,\nCratylus, Euthydemus) comes a series of dialogues in which Plato\nwrites to a less tightly-defined format, not always focusing on a\n\u201cWhat is\u2026?\u201d question, nor using the\nquestion-and-answer interrogative method that he himself depicts as\nstrictly Socratic: the Phaedo, the Phaedrus, the\nSymposium, and the Republic. In these dialogues\nPlato shows a much greater willingness to put positive and ambitious\nmetaphysical views in Socrates\u2019 mouth, and to make Socrates the\nspokesman for what we call \u201cPlato\u2019s theory of Forms.\u201d\n\n\nAfter these, it is normally supposed that Plato\u2019s next two works were\nthe Parmenides and the Theaetetus, probably in that\norder. If so, and if we take as seriously as Plato seems to the\nimportant criticisms of the theory of Forms that are made in the\nParmenides, then the significance of the\nTheaetetus\u2019s return to the aporetic method looks obvious.\nApparently Plato has abandoned the certainties of his middle-period\nworks, such as the theory of Forms, and returned to the\nalmost-sceptical manner of the early dialogues. In the\nTheaetetus, the Forms that so dominated the\nRepublic\u2019s discussions of epistemology are hardly mentioned\nat all. A good understanding of the dialogue must make sense of this\nfact.\n",
