    "main_text": "Major Themes of Diderot\u2019s Philosophy || Radicalizing empiricism\n2.2 Radicalizing empiricism\n2.2.1 Empiricism, from epistemology to ontology\n\nDiderot is heavily influenced by Locke and in general by a kind of\nempiricism that was \u201cin the air\u201d: our knowledge about the\nworld is derived, either fully or at least in large part, from our\nsenses. In the Lettre sur les aveugles and its companion\npiece, the Lettre sur les sourds et muets, as well as later\npieces such as the R\u00eave, Diderot turns the question of\nthe senses and how we know the external world on its head: the senses\npossess or carry with them their own respective metaphysics. It is a\npowerful kind of relativism. And there is a new hierarchy in which\ntouch is fundamental, in direct opposition to classical philosophical\ndoctrines in which sight received that honour: throughout his work,\nbut especially in these two essays devoted to the metaphysics of the\nsenses and his various aesthetic writings, Diderot insists on the\nprimacy of touch, which he also describes as \u201cthe most\nphilosophical of senses\u201d; he deplores the fact that \u201cthe\nhands are despised for their materialism\u201d (LSM; DPV IV:\n15, 54). This is even given atheist overtones in the Lettre sur\nles aveugles when the blind mathematician Saunderson on his\ndeathbed declares that \u201cif you wish me to believe in God, you\nwill have to make me touch him\u201d (DPV IV: 48).\n\nDiderot expresses his materialism in this work through the character\nof a blind man, also because he is like a living counterexample to the\nargument from design. Indeed, Saunderson says to his interlocutor, who\nis defending physico-theological design and order: \u201cWhat did we\ndo to God, you and I, so that one of us possesses this organ (of\nsight), and the other of us is deprived of it?\u201d (DPV IV: 63). In\na further twist, Diderot also equates the blind man with idealist\nmetaphysics since it is also cut off from direct sensory engagement\nwith the world. Here, empiricism is no longer just a doctrine about\nthe sources of knowledge, i.e., an epistemology. The world of a blind\nman is different from that of a deaf man, and so forth. Further, an\nindividual who possessed a sense in addition to our five senses would\nfind our ethical horizon quite imperfect (DPV IV: 27).\n\nA similar displacement of the \u201cscope\u201d of empiricism occurs\nin the companion Lettre sur les sourds et muets, with a\nrather different version of Condillac\u2019s thought experiment of\nthe statue:\n\n\nMy idea would be to decompose a man, so to speak, and examine what he\nderives from each of the senses he possesses. I recall how I was once\nconcerned with this sort of metaphysical anatomy, and had found that\nof all the senses, the eye was the most superficial, the ear the most\nproud, smell the most pleasurable, and taste the deepest, most\nphilosophical sense. It would be a pleasant society, I think\u2014one\ncomposed of five people, each of whom only possessed one sense. They\nwould undoubtedly call each other mad, and I leave you to imagine how\nright they might be. Yet this is an image for what happens to\neveryone: one only has one sense and one judges on everything. (DPV\nIV: 140)\n\n\nThe senses here are treated as producing \u201cworlds\u201d in which\nwe live, not as epistemological sources of knowledge, which was the\nstrict issue raised by\n Molyneux\u2019s Problem\n (if a person born blind, with an understanding of basic mathematics,\nrecovered their sight and saw a cube, would they instantly know what\nit was?), a problem that goes through considerable reconfiguration\nwith the character of Saunderson.\n2.2.2 Empiricism and experimentalism\n\nEmpiricism is further transformed by Diderot in accordance with his\nproject to transform knowledge by inscribing it in the sphere of\npractice and \u201carts and crafts\u201d, especially with the\nEncyclop\u00e9die. He sometimes refers approvingly to the\nmanual labourer (manouvrier)\u2019s production of an\nartisanal knowledge, notably in his 1753 Pens\u00e9es sur\nl\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la nature (\u00a7 XXX), which\nnot coincidentally sounds Baconian and Lockean. But more surprisingly,\nhe also equates this transformed, even \u201cenhanced\u201d vision\nof empiricism with a metaphysics. That is, on the one hand he is an\nempiricist advocating the experimental sources of new knowledge,\nsometimes presented as \u201cexperimental philosophy\u201d:\n\n\nExperimental philosophy does not know what its work will yield or fail\nto yield; but it works without pause. On the contrary, rational\nphilosophy weighs the possibilities, makes pronouncements, and stops\nthere. It boldly declares, light cannot be decomposed;\nexperimental philosophy listens, and remains silent for centuries;\nthen suddenly shows us the prism, and declares, light is\ndecomposed. (IN, \u00a7 XXIII; DPV IX: 43\u201344; his\nemphasis)\n\n\nWe can also see this anti-foundationalist and experimentalist attitude\nas challenging Descartes\u2019 \u201cchains of reasons\u201d which\nextend to all our knowledge of things; Diderot begins the above work\nby explaining that he will let his thoughts follow the order in which\nobjects presented themselves to his reflection (\u00a7 I). Such a view\nis also resonant with what we might term Malebranche\u2019s\nquasi-sensationalism, which locates scientific thinking in the\nreduction of our stream of sensate observations to the rationalizing\nlogics of mathematical analysis, if we consider that, aside from the\n\u201coccasionalism\u201d which has dominated his Anglophone\nreception, much of Malebranche\u2019s Recherche de la\nverit\u00e9 is about how our bodily passions and our sensations\nproduce errors in us, which makes Malebranche a sensationalist in\nrecognizing that conception of the human subject as the start for any\nepistemological project of knowing. Diderot, from the Lettre sur\nles aveugles on, is a dedicated empiricist and sensationalist,\nalthough he expands the remit of these philosophical programs far\nbeyond \u201cepistemology\u201d.\n\nBut on the other hand, Diderot treats the idea of experimental\nphilosophy rather playfully, both endorsing it and going beyond it in\na more speculative direction, as when he mockingly refers to the\nmathematician\u2019s self-confident rejection of metaphysics by\nwriting, \u201cthe metaphysician \u2026 is someone who knows\nnothing\u201d, and comments that\n\n\nchemists, physicians, naturalists and all of those engaged in\nexperimental practices (l\u2019art exp\u00e9rimental)\n\u2026 seem to me to be on the point of avenging metaphysics, and\napplying the same definition to the mathematician (IN, \u00a7\nIII; DPV IX: 29\u201330)\n\n\navenging metaphysics, in the sense of turning the charge of being\noverly speculative back at the scientists!\n2.2.3 An experimental metaphysics\n\nSometimes the empiricist and the metaphysical tendencies are\nencapsulated in a single formulation, as in the \u201cexperimental\nmetaphysics\u201d in the Bijoux indiscrets, by which he\nmeans an experience-based metaphysics, building up from the fact that\n\u201call is experimental in us\u201d (SA; DPV XVI: 87);\nthis formulation does not mean that we are the result of an endless\nseries of trial and error attempts, but that all results from\nexperience.\n\nIn his Encyclop\u00e9die article\n\u201cM\u00e9taphysique\u201d, Diderot also opposes an abstract\nmetaphysics of time, space and being to a practice-based metaphysics:\nhe suggests that practitioners such as musicians and geometricians be\nasked about the \u201cmetaphysics of their art\u201d, which will\nyield promising results, just as in the Pens\u00e9es sur\nl\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la nature he lauded the figure\nhe described as the \u201cmanouvrier\nd\u2019exp\u00e9rience\u201d, a kind of artisan-experimenter whose\npractice has yielded, over years of experience, an artisanal\nknowledge.\n\nContrary to a now-common idea that the opposition between rationalism\nand empiricism should be replaced with a more historically legitimate\nopposition between experimental philosophy and speculative philosophy\n(Anstey 2005), Diderot\u2019s case suggests a blend between\nempiricism cum experimentalism, and speculation. He is often\nconfronted with the need to continue his analysis of phenomena beyond\nthe limits of strict empiricism: the nature of matter, the limits of\nanimation or on the more internal scale, the functioning of the\nnervous system or the mechanics of generation. And here the need for\nmetaphysical imagination comes into play, which is not the same as a\nstrictly abstract metaphysics. Once again, Diderot\u2019s criticisms\nof mathematical abstraction in favor of the greater concreteness of\nthe life sciences, which he shares with Buffon, can be adduced\nhere.\n2.3 Materialism, science and living matter\n\nDiderot was not a physician like La Mettrie, or a \u201cworking\nnatural historian\u201d like Buffon, although at one point he wrote\nthat, \u201cIt is very hard to do metaphysics or ethics well, without\nbeing an anatomist, a naturalist, a physiologist, and a\nphysician\u201d (RH; DPV XXIV: 555). Nevertheless, one of\nhis first publications was the translation of James\u2019\nMedicinal Dictionary (1745), and in addition to his enormous\nactivity as the chief editor of the Encyclop\u00e9die,\nwhich heavily features medical entries, sometimes with his editorial\ninterventions, he was also a serious student of chemistry, including\n\u201cvital chemistry\u201d (P\u00e9pin 2012). Later in life he\ndeclared that \u201cthere were no books I read more willingly than\nmedical books\u201d (EP; DPV XVII: 510).\n\nGiven this background, Diderot\u2019s interactions with the life\nsciences of his time can be understood, obviously, as the activity of\nan educated individual with a strong interest in the implications for\nphilosophy of new scientific discoveries and conceptual schemas,\nwhether from medicine, biology, or natural history. But his\narticulation of all of these in a materialist project does\nnot belong to or open onto an episode amongst others in the history of\nscience. That is, his articulation of a unique kind of philosophical\nmaterialism is indeed in \u201cdialogue with\u201d or\n\u201cinfluenced by\u201d the sciences of his time, particularly the\nlife sciences (which included chemistry for Diderot), but it is also a\nspeculative project; materialism in Diderot\u2019s time, like in\nours, was not a monolithic concept (Springborg and Wunderlich [eds]\n2016).\n2.3.1 Vital materialism as \u201cmodern Spinozism\u201d\n\nDiderot opposed the novelty and conceptual significance of the life\nsciences to what he (incorrectly) judged to be the historical\nstagnation of mathematics:\n\n\nWe are on the verge of a great revolution in the sciences. Given the\ntaste people seem to have for morals, belles-lettres, the\nhistory of nature and experimental physics, I dare say that before a\nhundred years, there will not be more than three great geometricians\nremaining in Europe. The science will stop short where the Bernoullis,\nthe Eulers, the Maupertuis, the Clairauts, the Fontaines and the\nD\u2019Alemberts will have left it\u2026. We will not go beyond.\n(IN, \u00a7 IV; DPV IX: 30\u201331)\n\n\nSimilarly, in a letter to Voltaire five years later (February 19\n1758), he wrote clearly that \u201cThe reign of mathematics has\nended. Tastes have changed, in favor of natural history and\nletters\u201d. Diderot is opposing the new \u201ctaste\u201d and\ninterest for a set of preoccupations including two forms of\n\u201clife science\u201d (natural history and \u201cexperimental\nphysics\u201d) to the traditional prestige of mathematical science.\nIn these passages, he is also squarely locating his materialist\npreoccupations within the former.\n\nDiderot\u2019s natural philosophy is deeply and centrally\n\u201cbiologistic\u201d. As it emerges in the mid-eighteenth\ncentury, at a time before the appearance of the term\n\u201cbiology\u201d as a way of designating a unified science of\nlife, his project is motivated by the desire both to understand the\nlaws governing organic beings and to emphasize, more philosophically,\nthe uniqueness of organic beings within the physical world as a whole.\nConsider a little-known aspect of Diderot\u2019s articulation of his\nproject: his statement in favour of biological epigenesis within his\nshort entry \u201cSpinosiste\u201d in the\nEncyclop\u00e9die. The entry does not bear his name, but\nlarge parts of the content occur elsewhere in his writings, and it is\nincluded in all editions of his works. Here he grafts new biological\nideas such as epigenesis onto a Spinozist substance metaphysics (Wolfe\n2014a), distinguishing between \u201cancient\u201d and\n\u201cmodern\u201d Spinozists and emphasizing that the latter\nspecifically hold that \u201cmatter is sensitive\u201d, as\ndemonstrated \u201cby the development of the egg, an inert body which\nby means of heat alone moves to the state of a sensing, living\nbeing\u201d. For modern Spinozists, \u201conly matter exists, and\nthat it is sufficient to explain everything. For the rest, they follow\nancient Spinozism in all of its consequences\u201d (Enc. XV:\n474).\n\nDiderot is rather unexpectedly combining Spinoza\u2019s metaphysics\nof substance with a new theory of biological development, epigenesis,\naccording to which the embryo grows by the successive addition of\nlayers of purely material substance. Why call the latter view\n\u201cmodern Spinozism\u201d? The \u201cancient Spinozists\u201d\nare substance monists and metaphysicians, while their modern\ndescendants are also committed to biological epigenesis, and assert\nthat matter is fundamentally living matter. Is this Spinozism\nor not? What possible relation could there be between Spinozism and\nepigenesis? Or how can a metaphysics of substance and modes, which\nsays almost nothing about biological entities even if it is also a\nmajor statement of philosophical naturalism, also be a fashionable\nembryological theory of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries? In\nfact, very few commentators have asked why Diderot gives such\nan idiosyncratic definition of \u201cmodern Spinozism\u201d.\n\nTo be sure, his convictions regarding living matter (or all of matter\ninasmuch as it is potentially living and sensing) are tied to his\nadmiration for the metaphysics of a single substance composed of an\ninfinite number of modes. As he states in the R\u00eave de\nD\u2019Alembert, \u201cThere is only one substance in the\nuniverse\u201d (DPV XVII, 107; Wartofsky 1952/1979, Deprun 1986,\nBourdin 2008). But nowhere does Spinoza seek to connect his\nmetaphysics to the life sciences; even if the notion of the conatus\nwas frequently taken up in the generations after him to mean something\nlike a survival impulse in living beings, this was not what he meant\nat all. Diderot is grafting \u201cvitalist\u201d elements onto a\nsubstance metaphysics, or at least, he is connecting an apparently\nempirical account of the self-organisation of matter with a\nnew metaphysics. Epigenesis is not just one biological theory among\nothers here, but rather, part of a revised metaphysics of matter,\nwhich Diderot presents in more overtly ideological terms in the\nR\u00eave:\n\n\nDo you see this egg? With this you can overthrow all the schools of\ntheology, all the churches of the world. What is this egg? An\nunsensing mass, prior to the introduction of the seed\n[germe]; and after the seed has been introduced, what is it\nthen? Still an unsensing mass, for the seed itself is merely an inert,\ncrude fluid. How will this mass develop into a different [level of]\norganisation, to sensitivity and life? By means of heat. And what will\nproduce the heat? Motion. (DPV XVII, 103\u2013104)\n\n\nMatter for Diderot is self-organizing and endowed with vital\nproperties. This implies that his brand of materialism is not\nsynonymous with\n physicalism\n (admittedly, not a term or notion of the period). There were of\ncourse materialists such as\n Hobbes\n who can also be described as physicalists, but Diderot was quite\nexplicitly a determinist, as we will discuss below (in\n section 2.4).\n This leads to two rather original consequences, which we examine in\nthe following sections: Diderot\u2019s metaphysics of vital matter is\nnot strictly experimentally based, it is also speculative; and his is\na specifically embodied materialism.\n2.3.2 Matter theory and living matter\n\nIn the very first paragraph of Le R\u00eave de\nD\u2019Alembert, the character D\u2019Alembert, who is a\npartisan of substance dualism and is challenging the character\nDiderot\u2014a materialist\u2014to account for the existence of\nconsciousness and thought, introduces the problem of sensibility\n(sensibilit\u00e9, better translated\n\u201csensitivity\u201d) as a property. Referring to a discussion\nthat seems to have occurred before the text begins, he declares to\nDiderot, \u201cthis sensitivity \u2026 if it is a general and\nessential quality of matter, then stones must sense\u201d (DPV XVII,\n90). Diderot states, revises, emends and restates this materialism of\nliving, sensing matter in a variety of works, both in the\nR\u00eave and in his more \u201cempirically\u201d oriented\nwritings such as the Principes philosophiques sur la\nmati\u00e8re et le mouvement and the El\u00e9ments de\nphysiologie.\n\nLater, building on an explicitly chemical matter theory, Diderot will\ndescribe nature as perpetually \u201cin action and reaction;\neverything being destroyed in one form and recomposed in another;\nsublimations, dissolutions and combinations of all kinds\u201d, in\nthe \u201cgeneral movement or rather fermentation of the\nuniverse\u201d (PPMM; DPV XVII: 17\u201318). This short\npiece of \u201cphilosophy of physics\u201d includes a polemic aimed\nat all those who define matter as inert and homogeneous (latter-day\nCartesians). Diderot wants to establish in contrast that motion is\ninherent in matter by joining together translation and nisus.\nIndeed, matter possesses properties including sensitivity.\n\nThe key property of living matter, and of all matter potentially, is\norganic sensitivity. Diderot often suggests that \u201csensitivity or\ntouch is common to all beings\u201d, and he often attributes\nsensitivity to matter as a whole (EP; DPV XVII: 308). In\n\u201cLeibnizianisme\u201d, he brings together Aristotle\u2019s\nentelechy, Leibniz\u2019s monads, and sensitivity as a \u201cgeneral\nproperty of matter\u201d (Enc. IX: 371); indeed, Leibnizian\nmetaphysics and theories of generation had a great impact on\neighteenth-century thought, and has been viewed as major influences in\nthe formulation of Diderot\u2019s materialism, albeit in naturalized\nform, e.g: \u201cthe monad, the real atom of nature, the true element\nof things\u201d (Enc. IX: 374a). Elsewhere, such as the 1765\nLetter to Duclos, Diderot denies that sensitivity can be a property of\na molecule, specifically because it can only be a property of matter\nitself. He then complicates the issue further by introducing a\ndistinction between \u201cinert\u201d sensitivity and\n\u201cactive\u201d sensitivity.\n\nNevertheless, Diderot\u2019s matter theory is very much one of a\nliving, sensing, self-transforming matter, sometimes specified in\nchemical terms:\n\n\nYou can practice geometry and metaphysics as much as you like; but I,\nwho am a physicist and a chemist, who take bodies in nature and not in\nmy mind, I see them as existing, various, bearing properties and\nactions, as agitated in the universe as they are in the laboratory\nwhere if a spark is in the proximity of three combined molecules of\nsaltpeter, carbon and sulfur, a necessary explosion will ensue.\n(PPMM; DPV XVII: 34)\n\n\nThe critique of mathematical abstraction in favor of a more\nempirically rich matter theory, whether this is presented as deriving\nfrom natural history, chemistry, medicine, physiology or other\ndisciplines, is also a constant in Diderot. The point we would\nemphasize most, however, is that this is also a speculative\nmetaphysics. The shift from inert to active sensitivity is not\nexperimentally grounded. That Diderot\u2019s materialism was not\nstrictly an outgrowth of empiricism, and/or experimentally based, as\none might expect given the usually close relation between scientific\npractice and materialist philosophy, is also apparent in the\ndimensions he sometimes is willing to allow to his cosmogony of\nuniversally living matter.\n\nOn one occasion, he wrote to Sophie Volland describing how such ideas\nled him to be teased, but he pushes them even further in the letter,\nin the direction of a materialist account of love. The result is not\nso much a reductionist explanation of the phenomenon of love as a\nromanticization of materialism itself:\n\n\nThe rest of the evening was spent teasing me about my paradox. People\ngave me beautiful pears that were alive, grapes that could think. And\nI said: Those who loved each other during their lives and arrange to\nbe buried next to one another are maybe not as mad as one thinks.\nTheir ashes may be pressed together, mingling, uniting. What do I\nknow? Maybe they have not lost all feeling, all memory of their prior\nstate. Maybe they have a remainder of heat and life, which they enjoy\nin their own fashion, at the bottom of the cold urn in which they\nrest. We judge the life of elements by the life of crude aggregates.\nMaybe they are entirely different entities\u2026. When the polyp is\ndivided into a hundred thousand parts, the primitive, generational\nanimal is no longer, but all of its principles are still alive. O my\nSophie, I then still have a hope of touching, sensing, loving, seeking\nyou, uniting and melding with you, when we are no longer. If there\nwere a law of affinity amidst our principles, if we were entitled to\ncompose a common being; if, in following centuries, I were to comprise\na whole again with you; if the molecules of your dissolved lover were\nto stir, to move about, and search out yours, scattered throughout\nnature! Grant me this chimaera. It is sweet to me. It would ensure my\neternity in you and with you \u2026. (letter of 15 October 1759,\ntranslation C. Wolfe)\n\n\nThis image of a kind of eternity in which \u201cloving\nmolecules\u201d gradually return to one another, impelled by a\nresidual consciousness of the love present in their \u201cparent\nbodies\u201d, resonates with the powerful rendition he gives in the\nfirst dialogue of the R\u00eave of the thought experiment of\nthe statue. Recall that the character D\u2019Alembert had challenged\nthe character Diderot to show that matter could think, and the latter\nhad retorted that if he could show that matter could sense the\nsolution would be found. The character Diderot then proposed a thought\nexperiment of a marble statue, ground into powder, mixed into the\nearth, out of which plants grow that are eaten by animals who are in\nturn eaten by us. He calls this process the\n\u201canimalization\u201d of matter. Thus framed, the difference\nbetween a piece of marble and a sensing, conscious creature is only a\ndifference in the temporal stages of a portion of matter in\ntransformation. Unlike Condillac\u2019s statue, Diderot\u2019s is no\nlonger a strictly epistemological account of the genesis of our\nknowledge (and self-consciousness) through the accumulation of\nintermodal sensory information. Instead, it is an assertion of the\nanimalization of inert matter, such that all matter is either actually\nor potentially alive.\n2.3.3 Body and embodiment\n\nBut what of actual bodies in this universe of living matter?\nDiderot\u2019s notion of body is quite different from, say, that of\nDescartes and Hobbes. \u201cAs a physicist\u201d, Diderot writes,\n\u201cone should never say the body qua body, because this\nis no longer physics, it is making abstractions which lead to\nnothing\u201d (PPMM; DPV XVII: 16). As he wrote to Sophie\nVolland, \u201cHave you ever thought seriously about what it is to\nlive? \u2026 Life is not just motion, it is something else\u201d\n(letter of 15 October 1759). Indeed, he may quite fairly be described\nas a theorist of embodiment.\n\nHis materialist notion of embodiment means that Diderot does not\noppose the living body as a kind of subjectivity to the world of\nmatter overall. As is particularly apparent with Saunderson in the\nLettre sur les aveugles and the account of the nervous system\nin the R\u00eave de D\u2019Alembert, Diderot \u201cpit[s]\nthe unity of sensibility against a Cartesian unity of\nsubjectivity\u201d (Gaukroger 2010: 416). However, this emphasis on\nembodiment is neither a \u201ctop-down\u201d, emergent view of life\n(even if \u201clife is not just motion\u201d), nor an\nantireductionist position (contrast Kaitaro 1997). For Diderot,\nemphasis on the features of the living body and a deflationary and/or\nreductionist attitude go hand in hand. \u201cThe action of the soul\non the body is the action of one part of the body on another\u201d,\nhe writes, \u201cand the action of the body on the soul is again that\nof one part of the body on another\u201d (EP; DPV XVII:\n334\u2013335). This was certainly reductionist in the eyes of\ndefenders of an immortal and/or immaterial soul, but it is not per se\neliminativist inasmuch as Diderot is saying that\n\u201cmental processes\u201d (if we take the language of\n\u201csoul\u201d here to be psychological language) are bodily\nprocesses, not that they are illusory or otherwise unreal. Similarly,\ncommenting on the Dutch scientist Franz Hemsterhuis\u2019 manuscript,\nhe notes: \u201cwherever I read soul I replace it with\nman or animal\u201d (DPV XXIV: 340). This is a\nvenerable trait of materialisms going back at least as far as\nLucretius, and Diderot does not necessarily deploy this tradition to\ndeny the existence of the soul, but rather to challenge the\n\u201canimist\u201d or the \u201cidealist\u201d claim \u201cto\nexplain anything without the body\u201d (EP; DPV XVII: 334).\nEven more interestingly, this shift can also be seen in broader terms\nas a shift within reductionist strategies, which we can also\nclassify as types of reduction.\n\nOne strategy for the early modern materialist was to deny the\nexistence of a \u201chigher-level\u201d entity such as the soul (or\nfree will, or thinking, etc.) in favor of a hypothetical \u201cbasic\nphysics\u201d or the properties of matter in general. Thus La Mettrie\nwrote, in his 1748 L\u2019Homme-Machine, that\n\n\nThe soul is just a pointless term of which we have no idea and which a\ngood mind should only use to refer to that part of us which thinks.\nGiven the slightest principle of movement, animate bodies will have\neverything they need to move, feel, think, repent and in a word,\nbehave in the physical realm as well as the moral realm which depends\non it. (La Mettrie 1987, vol. I: 98)\n\n\nIn contrast, another strategy is to construe \u201csoul\u201d in\nfunctional terms, as not conflicting in any way with a basic\nmaterialist ontology, if it is not a substance of its own. Thus the\nmaterialist could be less overtly confrontational towards the concept\nof soul. For instance, because it has been naturalised, the soul can\nbe treated, as La Mettrie suggests, as \u201cbut a principle of\nmotion or a material and sensible part of the brain\u201d (La Mettrie\n1987, vol. I: 105). Here, as in Diderot, the status of the soul is\ndisplaced away from metaphysics towards the particular physiological\nsite of the brain. Diderot\u2019s El\u00e9ments de\nphysiologie, as well as his supplementary remarks in the article\n\u201c\u00c2me\u201d, stress both the complexity of the brain for\nany reductionist materialist project, and the\n\u201cdisplacement\u201d of the soul therein. The concept of the\nbody which is at work in these materialist texts is, if not\n\u201censouled\u201d, certainly animated and vitalised, as in this\nremark of Diderot\u2019s:\n\n\nWhatever idea we initially have of [the soul], it is necessarily a\nmobile, extended, sensitive and composite entity. It grows tired just\nlike the body, it rests like the body, it loses its control over the\nbody just as the body loses its control over the soul\u2026. Is the\nsoul gay, sad, angry, tender, shy, lustful? It is nothing without the\nbody. (EP; DPV XVII: 334)\n\n\nHe also presents the brain as the source of our identity, or of what\nit is for me to be me, although he sometimes thinks it is the whole\norganism which composes our individuality. He recognizes the brain as\na very particular kind of organ, one in need of special attention,\nand, rather unusually for the period, he seems to call attention to\nits plasticity in a discussion of memory:\n\n\nThe soft substance of the brain [is] a mass of sensitive and living\nwax, which can take on all sorts of shapes, losing none of those it\nreceived, and ceaselessly receiving new ones which it retains. There\nis the book. But where is the reader? The reader is the book itself.\nFor it is a sensing, living, speaking book, which communicates by\nmeans of sounds and gestures the order of its sensations. (DPV XVII:\n470)\n\n\nDiderot had been discussing several extremely lyrical cases of\nrecalling landscapes both in nature and in painting, and then almost\nabruptly turns to cerebral-material explanations of such phenomena.\nWhat is unusual about this in the history of philosophical and early\nneurophysiological discussions of the brain is Diderot\u2019s\nstriking image of the brain as a book which reads itself, and the\nembodied brain-reader as self-organizing (Wolfe 2016b).\n\nEven if Diderot\u2019s conception of body and brain indicate that he\nis not treating them in terms of basic physics alone, he holds the\nexistence of causal relations to be fundamental; as he writes,\n\u201c\u2018Every cause is an effect\u2019 seems axiomatic to\nme\u201d (DPV XXIV: 309). Without this foundationally construed sense\nof causality, Nature would constantly be taking leaps, which he thinks\nis a mistaken vision of things. In other words, he is committed to a\nform of determinism.\n2.4 Determinism and change\n\nAll forms of materialism are deterministic, but in different ways.\nNothing compels the materialist to accept that the body and the\npassions are deterministic just like a simple machine.\nUnsurprisingly, a lot depends on how causes are understood,\nand how much weight they are meant to bear in both an ontology and an\naccount of action (see entry on\n causal determinism).\n Thus it is quite possible to hold, like Helv\u00e9tius,\nd\u2019Holbach or Hobbes, that there is a fixed, stable and\npredictable relation between our sensory input, our mental life and\nconsequently our \u201ctemper\u201d and our actions. \u201cAs a\nbeing that is organized so as to think and to feel\u201d,\nD\u2019Holbach explained, \u201cyou must feel pleasure or pain; you\nmust love or hate in accordance with the way your organs are affected\nby the causes surrounding you or within you\u201d (D\u2019Holbach\n1770/1781: I.i [1990: 18]).\n\nBut the organismic elements in Diderot\u2019s materialism and vision\nof the body lead him to challenge Helv\u00e9tius\u2019 program of\nreform, which asserts, on the basis of an empiricist and specifically\nsensationalist epistemology, that human beings really are fully\nmodifiable \u201cblank slates\u201d, modifiable in terms of\nwhat we call stimuli and responses. Interestingly, it is by denying\nthis \u201cfull modifiability\u201d that Diderot can defend a\ncertain notion of individuality. The fact that individuals differ from\neach other at the level of their organisation grants them a\ndegree of self-determination. \u201cEvery day, I see men who prefer\nto die rather than to correct themselves\u201d (DPV XVIII: 344). That\nis, what Diderot calls \u201cmodifiability\u201d, which might better\nbe termed \u201ccorrigibility\u201d, has limits, and these limits do\nnot just reflect some kind of blunt innatism (whether of genetic\nheritage or of character), but rather a degree of individuality,\nincluding at the level of agency. Biologically, Diderot often stressed\nthe enormous variation of traits such as intelligence from one\nindividual to another, noting that the difference between an\n\u201cidiot\u201d and a \u201cgenius\u201d hinges on tiny shifts\nin \u201cbrain fibers\u201d. There is more difference, he insists,\nbetween one individual and another in terms of intelligence than\nbetween a human being and an animal (DPV XXIV: 299). But there is no\nsharp divide between the biological and the personal, for Diderot.\n\nHelv\u00e9tius had described to Diderot how severely he was punished\nfor De l\u2019Esprit, with the consequence that he would\n\u201crather die than write another line again\u201d. Diderot\nresponds with a long tale about two cats he saw from his window, who\nfell from a roof. One died from the fall, but the other got up,\nbruised and bloodied, and said to himself,\n\n\nI would rather die than ever climb on the roof again. What am I\nlooking for up there? A mouse that is not worth the tasty morsel I\ncould get from my mistress, or steal from the cook \u2026\n\n\nHowever, as soon as the cat feels better, he climbs back up on the\nroof again (RH; DPV XXIV: 542\u2013543). Just like the cat\nis determined by his own constitution and drives, similarly,\nHelv\u00e9tius has no choice but to go on writing.\n\nDiderot\u2019s determinism is also his way of extending core\nempiricist tenets such as nihil est in intellectu quod non fuerit\nin sensu (there is nothing in the mind that was not first in our\nsense), which acquires a determinist dimension: \u201cthere is only\none operation in man, sensing. This operation is \u2026 never\nfree\u201d (OH; DPV XXIV: 300; cf. PC; DPV XX: 85)\nand\n\n\nperception comes from sensation; from perception, we get reflection,\nmeditation and judgment. There is nothing free in intellectual\noperations, or in sensation. (EP; DPV XVII: 335)\n\n\nThere is also a tension in Diderot\u2019s approach to determinism\nbetween his acceptance of physicalism (\u201cthere is only one kind\nof cause \u2026 physical causes\u201d: to Landois, DPV IX: 258) and\ncausal closure (\u201cthe physical world and the moral world are one\nand the same\u201d: PC; DPV XX: 53), and his insistence that\nagency, which for him covers the action of complex organisms overall\nand is not restricted to humans or even higher mammals, requires\nanother, specific kind of causality: \u201cI am a man, and I require\ncauses proper to man\u201d (RH; DPV XXIV: 523). Diderot is\nnot defending free will or an unchallenged space of agency, yet there\nis a kind of residual anthropocentrism in some of his arguments,\npresented in the language of unified causality. As he explains:\n\n\nWithout regard for the sum of elements of which I am composed, I am\none, and a cause only has one effect. I have always been one single\ncause [une cause une], thus I have never had more than one\neffect to produce; my duration is thus nothing more than a succession\nof necessary effects.\n\n\nDiderot is neither asserting total interconnection (as in Laplacian\ndeterminism) nor defending the existence of freedom to act as\n\u201cindifference\u201d or \u201cagent causation\u201d, but an\nintermediate view (once known as the Hume-Mill thesis) according to\nwhich what it is to be \u201cme\u201d is to be a particular causal\nnexus.In that sense, I cannot \u201cdo otherwise than myself\u201d\nor \u201cbe anyone other than myself\u201d (JLF; DPV XXIII:\n190, 28; on Diderot on individuality and selfhood, see Thiel 2015,\nWolfe 2015).\n\nHowever, in good Lucretian fashion, this unified causal loop we call\n\u201courself\u201d or \u201cmyself\u201d is itself subject to\nwhat Diderot terms \u201cvicissitude\u201d, a term that connotes\nchange and flux in this context.\n\n\nIn one and the same man, everything is in perpetual\nvicissitude\u2026 It is only by means of memory that we are the same\nindividual to others and to ourselves. At my age, there may not be a\nsingle molecule in my body that I brought into the world at my birth;\n(DPD; DPV X: 423)\n\neverything changes, everything passes \u2026 only the Whole remains.\n(RA; DPV XVII: 128)\n\n\nDiderot wrote that\n\n\nfruits, vegetables and animals are in perpetual vicissitude as regards\ntheir qualities, forms and constituents; an ancient from four thousand\nyears ago or better, our nephews in ten thousand years will most\nlikely recognize none of the fruits we have today;\n\n\nthus\n\n\nwe must be extremely careful in our judgments of the ancient\nhistorians and naturalists regarding the forms, virtues and other\nqualities of beings which are in perpetual alteration.\n(\u201cAcmella\u201d, Enc. I: 460a)\n\n\nThe instability in this continual movement between seemingly free and\nwillful individuality and collective, biological/metaphysical\ndeterminism also sits at the heart of the perpetual dialectic between\n\u201cMoi\u201dand \u201cLui\u201d in Le Neveu de\nRameau.\n\nFurther, this emphasis on mutability, change and\n\u201cvicissitudes\u201d including at a specifically biological\nlevel can sound evolutionary to a post-Darwinian reader, and for\nDiderot, \u201cto be born, to live, to die is merely to change\nforms\u201d (RA; DPV XVII: 139), in the\n\u201cever-changing\u201d \u201coverall order of nature\u201d:\n\u201cEverything is in in fluxu et eterno et perpetuo et\nnecessario\u201d (OH; DPV XXIV: 317). He also\nexplicitly uses the Lucretian phrase Rerum novus nascitur\nordo. Should these passages be understood as anticipations of\nevolutionary science? In fact, contrary to a widespread tendency in\nolder scholarship, it is mistaken to consider Diderot as either a\npredecessor or a speculative exponent of evolutionary doctrines. That\nhe was an earnest disciple of Lucretius, fascinated with monsters and\nwith the transience and mutability of the physical (particularly the\nliving) universe overall, does not make him a \u201cforerunner of\nDarwin\u201d.\n\nOn the biological side, his fascination with monsters also feeds into\nhis philosophy of nature overall. \u201cOn the entire surface of the\nearth\u201d, he writes,\n\n\nthere is not a single man who is normally constituted or perfectly\nhealthy. The human species is just a mass of more or less counterfeit,\nmore or less sick individuals \u2026 What I say of man applies just\nas well to animals, plants or minerals. (EP; DPV XVII:\n515)\n\n\nThis explains why, as he had written earlier,\n\n\nthe dissection of a monster \u2026 is more useful to the historian\nof nature [i.e., the experimental life scientist or biologist in\nmodern parlance] than the study of one hundred individuals who\nresemble each other. (\u201cEncyclop\u00e9die\u201d; DPV VII:\n242)\n\n2.5 Diderot\u2019s philosophical anthropology\n2.5.1 Aesthetics\n\nDiderot was a thoroughgoing naturalist and empirical scientist, but\nthis did not mean that he neglected the aesthetic dimension of human\nknowing, or the artifice of representation itself that makes possible\nlanguage, communication, and human knowledge. In his\nEncyclop\u00e9die entry on cabinets of natural history and\ntheir philosophical implications (\u201cCabinets d\u2019histoire\nnaturelle\u201d), he reflects explicitly on the challenge for our\nfinite intellects to seek to know infinite Nature as a whole, and\nrecommends the construction of artificial environments such as these\ncabinets in order to study \u201cparts of Nature\u201d. At times,\nhis vision of aesthetics is simply a kind of extension of his\nnaturalism into other domains, arguing like Spinoza that our\nsubjective notions of beauty and ugliness have no place in nature\nproperly understood (in the article \u201cLaideur\u201d; also\nSalon de 1763; DPV XIII: 373\u2013374), and argues for a\nnaturalist poetics (\u201cEncyclop\u00e9die\u201d; DPV VII: 234).\nYet he also held that aesthetics should not be reduced to crudely\nnaturalistic concepts, reflecting at length on the subjective issues\nof aesthetic perception and judgment and the role of performance,\nincluding that found in visual art, literature, theater, and\nscientific experiments, in the production of perceived truths.\n\nWith respect to the ostensibly subjective side of human knowing, he\ninvested considerable energy in articulating a concept of\n\u201cperception of relations\u201d (perception des\nrapports) which functions both as a theory of judgment\n(explaining why it is that we find certain kinds of symmetry and\nproportion pleasing) and a theory of cognitive functioning at a more\nbasic level, one characterized by psychoneural relations, as it were.\nCountering that subjective emphasis, however, Diderot also warned\nagainst the \u201csurfeit\u201d of organic sensitivity as a source\nof hyper-reactivity, and of sensory stimulus as a ground for\nperception without any internal unifying principle. These reflections\nare also found in the character Bordeu in the R\u00eave who\nserves to ground the perceptions and queries from Mlle de\nLespinasse regarding the ravings of the dreaming D\u2019Alembert in a\nclear objective ground. Diderot describes the overly sensitive actor\nin the Paradoxe sur le com\u00e9dien as suffering from a\n\u201cweakness in their constitution\u201d, and speaks ironically\nabout the welter of emotions (\u201cdes sensibilit\u00e9s\ndiverses\u201d) on stage being incapable of forming a unified\nwhole.\n2.5.2 Philosophy of language and representation\n\nUnifying these two aspects was the eclectic Malebranchian emphasis\nupon language as the bridge between the finite and the infinite, the\nmaterial and immaterial, the human knower and nature as a whole. In\nhis aesthetics, Diderot is continually preoccupied with the power of\nart to capture and represent natural experience and its limitation in\nthe face of the infinitude, and often unrepresentable complexity, of\nlife. In meta-works of what might be called his philosophy of theater\nsuch as Discours de la po\u00e9sie dramatique and\nParadoxe sur le com\u00e9dien, and in his dialogue where he\nconversed out loud with his readers about the theatrical logic\nunderlying his play Le Fils naturel, Diderot also pursued\nsuch themes by subjecting the \u201creality effect\u201d of\ntheatrical art to a systematic interrogation so as to unearth the\nrational structures of theater as a representative art form.\n\nDiderot reflected famously and influentially on what he called the\n\u201cfourth wall of the theatre\u201d, that imaginary barrier that\nseparates an audience from the three dimensions of the stage it faces.\nThis is a barrier that for Diderot acts either as conscious division\ndividing the actors and the drama from its viewer (theatre as a\nconsciously artificial way of representing and knowing) or as an\ninvisible screen through which the two join together into the joint\nexperience of the theatrical moment (theater as a staged naturalism).\nWhile still important in theatre theory today\u2014Richard Sennett\ninterprets Diderot as \u201cthe first great theorist of acting as a\nsecular activity\u201d and as the innovator who creates a theory of\ndrama \u201cdivorced from ritual\u201d\u2014Diderot\u2019s\nwritings on theatre also offer yet another example of his wider\nmetaphysical and physiological understanding of human beings and their\nembodied interrelation. They also highlight the role of language\nthroughout his philosophy as a tangible yet permeable and sometimes\nfragile tether joining humans and their knowing together.\n\nIn a manner similar to his \u201cphilosophy of theatre\u201d,\nDiderot\u2019s art criticism is also very often a study of the\ncontinually recurring interplay between sensible human subjectivity\nand the natural world through the perceived empirical reality of\nnatural representation. What happens when a viewer stands in front of\na painting and experiences its imagery? In particular, what is the\nrelationship between the reality of the viewer in the Louvre in the\nsalon gallery in front of the paintings on display and the reality of\nthe world represented by the image? What is it that happens exactly as\nwe move between these two worlds and realities? And given the presence\nof both a painting and its artist at the center of this exchange, what\nis the role played by the painter, his material medium, his craft in\nmanipulating matter into representations, and the viewing subject who\nboth receives this artistic work in her own senses and then recreates\nit in her imagination in the making of a \u201cnatural\nexperience\u201d?\n\nTo combine all these dimensions into a coherent concept of art, as\nDiderot did in his art criticism, was to produce a general aesthetics\nexploring the capacity for human representations to render experience\ntruthful and meaningful. Here, Diderot also explored the power and\nlimitations of such practices as a form of human experience. In this\nway, the problem of viewing art and speaking about the experience of\nviewing art, or the question of judging artists that stage this\nexperience, is akin to the problem of viewing and speaking about\nnature itself, and of judging the nature of the presentations put\nbefore us. Diderot\u2019s \u201cpromenade Vernet\u201d in the\nSalon de 1767 is something of a locus classicus for these\ninvestigations with its extended reflection on the presence of the\nviewer in front of a Vernet landscape painting and the being of that\nviewer in the natural world that the painting represents as well. His\nwork in natural philosophy and the life sciences often manifests a\nsimilar subject-object preoccupation as well, and in this respect\nDiderot\u2019s aesthetics and his natural philosophy have much in\ncommon.\n\nThe same combination is present in Diderot\u2019s literary fiction as\nwell in his continual, and often critical, exploration of the\nempirical reality of linguistic representation, and our capacities and\nlimitations for experiencing and knowing the world through such\nrepresentations. Jacques le fataliste, for example, is a kind\nof anti-novel that thwarts the arrival of naturalized realism and\ncredible illusion at every turn even as it narrates a bawdy and\nfrolicking story. Characters break with the scenes and dialogue of the\nstory to talk directly to the reader, and the narrator himself is a\nself-conscious character in the work who often finds himself in a\nstruggle with the fictions he is supposedly controlling and\nrepresenting for his readers.\n\nLe R\u00eave de D\u2019Alembert is also concerned with the\nrelation between author, textual characters, and the naturalistic and\nrational representation of thought in language and text, as is Le\nNeveu de Rameau, but while these dialogues organize the play\nbetween their various registers in a way that produces constructive\nphilosophical investigation, Jacques le fataliste operates\ndeconstructively, subverting the basic coherence of the novel as a\nform by repeating paragraphs verbatim on multiple pages and by\nintentionally distorting the book\u2019s narrative coherence and\nflow. One entire page of the book is printed in complete black, for\nexample, to call attention to the print characters that make all\nreading and linguistic communication possible. Diderot\u2019s story\nCeci n\u2019est pas un conte also operates in this\nsubversive and deconstructive way by prefiguring Magritte\u2019s\nfamous conundrum regarding the image of a pipe through a\nself-destructive recursion of a story that uses storytelling to deny\nthe possibility of storytelling even as it narrates a story.\n2.5.3 Ethics\n\nOne striking feature of Diderot\u2019s moral thought is his\nself-described failure to write a work of moral philosophy. While\nDiderot wanted to write such a work in order to refute La Mettrian\nimmoralism, especially its particularly bracing form of hedonism\ncoupled with its cynical social theory, he ultimately did not succeed\nin this ambition. He interestingly described his failure, or rather\nreluctance, to write a work of ethics as stemming from his recognition\nthat,\n\n\nif I do not emerge victorious from this attempt, I shall become the\napologist of wickedness, I will have betrayed the cause of virtue, and\nencouraged man towards vice. (RH: DPV XXIV: 589)\n\n\nDiderot had no desire to use his writings to ensure \u201cthe\nimmortality of the evildoer\u201d (ibid.; ERCN II,\n6; DPV XXV: 246\u2013247), and at the same time he also considered\nnormative moral philosophy to be a failure, a view he shared with such\nvirtuous individuals as Locke. (In response to his friend Lady\nPeterborough\u2019s request for advice on how to morally educate her\nson, Lord Morduant, Locke recommended, in a 1697 letter, that he\nshould read Livy (for history), along with geography and the study of\nmorality. But, he explained, \u201cI mean not the ethics of the\nschools\u201d, but rather Tully (i.e., Cicero), Pufendorf,\nAristotle and \u201cabove all the New Testament\u201d, wherein\n\u201ca man may learn how to live which is the business of ethics,\nand not how to define and distinguish and dispute about the names of\nvirtue and vice\u201d (King 1829: 5\u20136). This is not a ringing\nendorsement of academic moral philosophy, and Locke reiterates this\nview in his Thoughts Concerning Education, \u00a7 185 and the\nReasonableness of Christianity, \u00a7\u00a7\n241\u2013242.)\n\nAnother crucial feature of Diderot\u2019s ethics was his dislike for\nrelativism or at least for some of its possible consequences. Diderot\nlearned a great deal from Locke, Montaigne and other paragons of early\nWestern cultural relativism. Montaigne and Locke paid close attention\nto the case of cannibals; Locke, when he takes up the case of\ncannibals in the Essay, uses it to support anti-innatist\nviews with respect to what he calls \u201cpractical principles\u201d\n(that is, moral principles of conduct): he points out that the\nTupinamba tribe in the Amazon considers that a high form of virtue is\neating one\u2019s enemies, along with many other examples of\n\u201cenormities practised without remorse\u201d, in order\nto stress that \u201cmoral rules\u201d are not innate but culturally\nspecific and learned (Locke 1690 [1975: I.iii.9]). The challenge is\nnot to morals per se but to \u201cmores\u201d and customs which we\ntake to encapsulate morality. Diderot echoes these ideas notably in\nhis Suppl\u00e9ment au voyage de Bougainville, but contrary\nto widespread views, he did not think that such relativism had to\nentail libertinage, criticizing Hemsterhuis for reasoning \u201cas if\nlibertinage was a necessary consequence of materialism, which seems to\nme to match neither reason nor experience\u201d (OH; DPV\nXXIV: 251). Unlike La Mettrie (and the Marquis de Sade after him),\nDiderot maintained a strongly social concept of self. \u201cHe who\nhas studied himself\u201d, he wrote, \u201cwill have advanced in the\nknowledge of others, given, I think, that there is no virtue which is\nforeign to the wicked, nor vice foreign to the good\u201d\n(ERCN; DPV XXV: 226).While he did not develop a full-fledged\ntheory of sympathy like Hume or Smith, Diderot was nevertheless\nacutely conscious of the role of the passions in cementing the social\nbond, and how this role should be promoted in any viable ethical\ntheory.\n\nNevertheless, his hostility to immoralist versions of materialism did\nnot mean that he reneged on his overall naturalism, since his account\nof our behavior, and of good and evil, also seeks to tie it to our\nphysiological constitution (our organisation, in his\nterms).\n\n\nEthics is confined to the borders of a species \u2026 What is a\nspecies? A mass of individuals sharing a similar constitution. What,\nis this constitution the basis of ethics?\u2026 I believe so.\n(SA; DPV XVI: 206)\n\n\nIt is perhaps too naturalistic an ethics for some since \u201cthere\nis no rational goodness or wickedness, although there may be animal\ngoodness or wickedness\u201d (\u201cDroit naturel\u201d,\nEnc. V: 155b). By this Diderot means that we do not act in\naccordance with purely transcendent or immaterial principles in mind,\nbut that we are determined by motives, affects, desires, instincts and\nso on. Yet at the same time, as we also saw regarding determinism,\nDiderot is concerned not only with the universe in its entirety but\nwith specifically human chains of causal influence as well.\n\u201cWhat is a human being?\u201d he asks. \u201cAn animal?\nUndoubtedly, but dogs are animals too; so are wolves. Yet humans are\nneither wolves nor dogs\u201d (SA; DPV XVI: 205).\n\nDiderot explicitly eschews the natural ties that many see tying a\nmaterialist conception of human being directly and naturally with\nlibertinism, hedonism, and a purely self-interested and solipsistic\nconception of morality. This stance was reinforced in other ways by\nhis counter-conception of natural morality, an ethics which he often\ncelebrated in his writings about aesthetic representation and its\nvalue. At the center of the naturalism that Diderot claimed for this\nethics was an implicit set of claims about experience, feeling, and\naction in human life. The natural principles of sensibility spoke\ndirectly to humans about the division between virtue and vice, or so\nDiderot believed, and while the virtuous individual was the one who\nsubmitted to the natural passions inherent in us pushing us toward\ncamaraderie and filial love, the vicious soul was a willful and\narrogant rebel who chases selfish desire and self-gratification\nagainst the grain of what is naturally good and true.\n\nThis metaphysical and physiological understanding of morality was\ncentral to Diderot\u2019s politics as well, and with respect to\ntheater it led him to theorize the mechanisms by which human\nperformance and theatrical display both supported and corrupted the\npursuit of virtue. Rousseau, with similar ethical orientations,\ncondemned theater outright as a false and corrupting medium, arguing\nthat natural religion and virtue could only be practiced in a natural,\ni.e., non-artificial or non-theatrical way. Diderot\u2019s view was\nmuch more complicated. While he recognized the corrupting power of\nartistic representation to deceive, he also recognized its power to\nprovoke and sustain natural experiences that promoted moral virtue.\nHis impassioned speeches written for imagined Africans oppressed by\nEuropean slavery, which he included in his contributions to\nRaynal\u2019s Histoire des deux Indes, illustrate well the\nfusion of theater and politics characteristic of Diderot. In these\nmoments, Diderot used the full power of theatrical language and\nartificial representation to present an unequivocal statement about\nmoral and political righteousness, one designed to move people to\nprogressive and virtuous political action. Rousseau\u2019s prize\nessay discourses produced in the 1750s were also influential upon\nDiderot in shaping his views, for like Rousseau Diderot developed an\nideal of natural, egalitarian, communitarian virtue, which he found\nmost fully developed in simple, rustic people who lived modestly and\nin close relation to their natural surroundings. Diderot also\ndeveloped a countervailing conception of vice that was directly\nconnected to wealth, especially wealth attached to elite privilege,\nand a morality that encouraged people to embrace basic organic\nfoundations for life and to turn away from urban lives of selfishness\nand hedonism. The same morality infused his political economic\nwritings as well, both in his celebration of the communitarian power\nof commerce to unite people into virtuous and prosperous polities, and\nin his critique of greed and commercial excess as a cause for social\nviolence and political injustice.\n2.5.4 \u201cMan and world\u201d\n\nAt the level of aesthetics, ethics or ontology itself, Diderot is a\nmaterialist concerned with utility, praxis, transformation and yes,\nagency (up to a point). Some commentators in earlier generations\nthought this spelled contradiction and the lack of any cogent\nphilosophical position. More recently, it has been recognized that\nDiderot was precisely reflecting on this tension between the\ncosmos and time-scales stretching millions of years, and his love for\nSophie Volland, or his desire to see goodness rewarded and wickedness\npunished. Indeed, he sometimes offers at least partial solutions to\nthis old aporia. If it is true, on the one hand, that\n\n\nThe universe only presents to us particular beings, infinite in\nnumber, with hardly any fixed or determinate division. None can be\ntermed the first or the last; everything is linked therein, and\nfollows what came before by imperceptible nuances. In this immense\nuniformity of objects, if some appear which, like the tips of rocks,\nseem to pierce through the surface and dominate it, they only owe this\nprerogative to particular systems, vague conventions, and foreign\nevents, not to the physical arrangement of beings and the intention of\nNature (\u201cEncyclop\u00e9die\u201d, Enc. V: 641b)\n\n\nso that there is no place for the human observer in this desolate\nlandscape, it is also true, on the other hand, that the only thing\nthat makes the existence of the spectacle of Nature interesting is the\nhuman presence itself:\n\n\nOne consideration above all must not be lost sight of, and that is\nthat if man or the thinking, contemplating being is banished from the\nsurface of the earth, this moving and sublime spectacle of nature\nbecomes nothing but a sad and mute scene\u2026. Everything changes\ninto a vast solitude where unobserved phenomena occur in a manner dark\nand mute. (Enc. V: 641c)\n\n\nInstead of losing himself in reveries about the poetics of ruins and\nour transitory existence on the face of the earth, however, Diderot\ninstantly asserts the pragmatic, \u201cconstructivist\u201d and\nartificialist conclusion: since \u201cIt is the presence of man that\nmakes the existence of beings interesting\u201d, \u201cWhy not make\nman the center of our work?\u201d The anthropocentrism here is of\ncourse not one which appeals to a human essence, or special dignity\nincluding some purported superiority we might possess over animals. It\nis rather a pragmatic position according to which schemes like the\nEncyclop\u00e9die, but also the arts, sciences and\ntechnological pursuits narrated in that work, serve to make that\n\u201clandscape\u201d meaningful.\n3. Conclusion\n\nFor Diderot, there is only one substance and it is material. Here, he\nis loosely aligned with Spinoza. But this substance is in perpetual\nflux (a more Lucretian element in his thought), so that the individual\nbeings we encounter are merely temporary, provisional clusters of\nmolecules in interaction with one another, in the midst of what he\nterms the general \u201cvicissitude\u201d of the cosmos (by which he\nmeans its change). In the entry \u201cImmuable\u201d\n(\u201cImmutable\u201d) he writes that \u201cNature is in a state\nof perpetual vicissitude. It follows from the general law of all\nbodies: either they are in motion, or they tend to be in motion\u201d\n(Enc. VIII: 577).\n\nBorrowing a Heraclitean motif and adding a now rather dated gender\ninflection, Diderot also describes Nature as a woman who enjoys\ndisguises (IN, \u00a7 XII, doubtless alluding to\nHeraclitus\u2019 phusis kruptesthai philei, \u201cNature\nlikes to hide\u201d, frag. 208). This is also why there are no\nmonsters in any real sense:\n\n\nI speak of monstrosity relative to what they are at present, for there\nare no monsters relative to the whole \u2026. If everything is\nin fluxu, which we can hardly doubt, all beings are\nmonstrous, that is, more or less incompatible with their corresponding\norder. (OH; DPV XXIV: 317, 403)\n\n\nThe matter of which we, as well as all other entities in the universe,\nare composed, is heterogeneous: differing in terms of energy and\nsensitivity, and in perpetually evolving relation to the Whole:\n\n\nThe world is ceaselessly beginning and ending; it is at every moment\nat the beginning and at the end; it never had, and never will have any\nother. In this vast ocean of matter, not one molecule resembles\nanother, not one molecule is self-identical for one moment.\n(RA; DPV XVII: 128)\n\n\nThat is, Nature is both fundamentally heterogeneous (the atoms which\ncompose the natural world exist in a state of heterogeneity and\nagitation) and never entirely \u201cspecific\u201d:\n\n\neach thing is more or less specific (quelconque), more or\nless earth, more or less water, more or less air, more or less fire;\nmore or less belonging to one kingdom or another \u2026 hence there\nis no essence of a particular being. (RA; DPV XVII: 138)\n\n\nAll beings\n\n\nhave an infinite number of relations to one another, according to the\nqualities they have in common; \u2026 it is a certain assemblage of\nqualities which characterizes them and distinguishes them\n(BI; DPV III: 183)\n\n\nIn this ever-changing Whole, there are provisional constructs and\nentities that are, like everything else, wholly material, but can be\nof greater or lesser significance to us, whether this is \u201ccashed\nout\u201d aesthetically, emotionally, ethico-politically or even in\nterms of nerve impulses (and Diderot, most of the time, is not wont to\ndistinguish sharply between these).\n\nDiderot invented a new form of materialism, drawing on a variety of\nsources including the Epicurean tradition, Hobbes and Locke, Spinoza\nand Leibniz. He also transformed doctrines, genres and nascent\nintellectual constellations (skepticism, the philosophical novel, and\neclecticism, to name some instances). Even if he did not wish to\ncontribute to the genre of systematic philosophy, his contribution to\nthe Enlightenment (and its posterity) and to subsequent intellectual\nepisodes is considerable, difficult to measure, and should be engaged\nwith.",
