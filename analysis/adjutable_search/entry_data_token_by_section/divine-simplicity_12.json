    "main_text": "Preserving Divine Transcendence While Avoiding Negative Theology || Stump\u2019s Quantum Metaphysics\n4.4 Stump\u2019s Quantum Metaphysics\n\nLike Dolezal, Eleonore Stump thinks of God as self-subsistent Being\n(esse). If God is absolutely simple, and not just simple in\nthe uncontroversial sense of lacking material parts, then God must be\nself-subsistent Being. God is at once both Being and something that\nis. He has to be both. If he were Being (esse) but not a\nbeing (id quod est), he could not enter into causal\nrelations. He could not do anything such as create the world,\nintervene in its operations, or interact with human persons. Such a\nGod would be \u201creligiously pernicious\u201d (Stump 2016, 199).\nIndeed, if God were Being but not a being, then one could not sensibly\nmaintain that God exists. For if Being is other than every being, then\nBeing is not. (It is instructive to note that Martin Heidegger, the\nfamous critic of onto-theology, who holds to the \u201contological\ndifference\u201d of Being (Sein) from every being\n(Seiendes) ends up assimilating Being to Nothing\n(Nichts).) On the other hand, if God were a being among\nbeings who merely has Being but is not (identically) Being, then he\nwould not be absolutely transcendent, worthy of worship, or ineffable.\nSuch a God would be \u201ccomfortingly familiar\u201d but\n\u201cdiscomfitingly anthropomorphic\u201d (Miller 1996, 3). It is\nnot clear that DDS is susceptible of a satisfactory articulation\nacceptable to most theists. There is no reason to be sanguine. But if\nsuch could be achieved then we would have a via media between\nthe Scylla of negative theology according to which nothing can be\ntruly said or known about God and the Charybdis of an anthropomorphic\ntheology according to which \u201c\u2026 God\u2019s properties are\nmerely human ones, albeit extended to the maximum degree\npossible\u201d (Miller, 1996, 3).\n\nThe problem, of course, is to explain how God can be both Being\n(esse) and something that is (ens). This is\nunintelligible to the discursive intellect. Either Being is other than\nbeings or it is not. If Being is other than beings, then Being cannot\nitself be. That would imply that God, who must be Being itself to be\nabsolute, cannot be. If, on the other hand, Being just is beings taken\ncollectively, then God could only be a being among beings and not the\nabsolute reality. To the discursive intellect the notion of\nself-subsistent Being is contradictory. For the idea here is that\nBeing itself is a being, a very special being no doubt, but\nnonetheless a being, something that is. One response to the\ncontradiction is simply to deny divine simplicity. That is a\nreasonable response, no doubt. But might it not also be reasonable to\nadmit that there are things that human reason cannot understand, and\nthat one of these things is the divine nature? \u201cHuman reason can\nsee that human reason cannot comprehend the quid est of\nGod.\u201d (Stump 2016, 205)\n\nOn one reading of Stump, she, like Dolezal, makes a mysterian move,\nand she, like Dolezal (2011, 210, fn 55), invokes wave-particle\nduality. We cannot understand how light can be both a wave phenomenon\nand also particulate in nature, and yet it is both:\n\nWhat kind of thing is it which has to be understood both as a wave and\nas a particle? We do not know. That is, we do not know the quid\nest of light. [\u2026] Analogously, we can ask: What kind of\nthing is it which can be both esse and id quod est?\nWe do not know. The idea of simplicity is that at the ultimate\nmetaphysical foundation of reality is something that has to\nbe understood as esse \u2014but also as id quod\nest. We do not know what this kind of thing is either. (Stump\n2016, 202)\n\n",
