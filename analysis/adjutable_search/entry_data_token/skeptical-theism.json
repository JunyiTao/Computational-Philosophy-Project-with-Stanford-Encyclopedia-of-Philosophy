There\u2019s the annoyance of a\nstubbed toe, the disappointment of personal or professional setback,\nthe endless frustration of debilitating chronic pain, and the\nsoul-crushing experience of the suffering and death of those we care\nthe most about (to name a few). It doesn\u2019t require extensive\neducation to worry if suffering and evil is evidence against the\nexistence of God\u2014or, at least, God understood classically, as a\nperfect being that is an all-powerful, all-knowing, all-good creator\nof the universe. This is the problem of evil, and when these worries\nare turned into arguments, they are known as arguments from evil.\n\nBut many of us\u2014again, theist, atheist, and agnostic\nalike\u2014are impressed by what God is supposed to be: a being with\nall perfections and knowledge, unencumbered by weaknesses or faults.\nGiven our own ignorance, imperfections, and limitations, it is hard to\nfully imagine such a being and its potential plans for the world.\nAgain, it doesn\u2019t require extensive education to worry that it\nwould be incredibly challenging for us\u2014in such a comparatively\nbenighted state\u2014to predict, anticipate, or understand all of the\nplans of such a being.\n\nSkeptical theism is a family of responses to arguments from evil.\nSkeptical theists think these two types of worries are related, that\nworries of the second type raise problems for worries of the first\ntype. More specifically, skeptical theism embraces two claims. First,\neven if theism were true, we should be skeptical of our abilities to\nreasonably predict all of God\u2019s plans for organizing the world,\nincluding those about the amount and nature of evil. Second, if this\nfirst claim is true, then it undermines or otherwise greatly mitigates\narguments from evil. Now these two claims are vague and imprecise, and\ndifferent skeptical theists spell them out in different ways depending\non the argument from evil they are evaluating. Additionally, neither\nof these claims assume theism; they can be coherently\naccepted by theists, atheists, and agnostics alike. Nonetheless,\ntheists frequently appeal to skeptical theism in defense of theism.\nThus, sometimes authors use the term \u2018skeptical theism\u2019 to\nrefer to the conjunction of these kinds of conditionals with a\ncommitment to theism; sometimes it is just these kinds of conditionals\nwithout a commitment to theism. For clarity here, we\u2019ll use\n\u2018skeptical theism\u2019 and similar phrases to be neutral with\nregard to whether theism is true.\n\nSkeptical theism has a number of historical precedents (see Rudavsky\n2013). It was reintroduced into the contemporary literature in a 1984\npaper by Stephen Wykstra. Since then, a variety of authors have\ndeveloped and defended it including William Alston, Alvin Plantinga,\nPeter van Inwagen, Michael Bergmann, and Daniel Howard-Snyder. The\nliterature on the topic is extensive and technical at points.\nConsequently, this entry must be selective and simplifying. The\noverall aim is to provide a basic understanding of the key issues\nsurrounding skeptical theism, with extensive references for readers to\ndig into the meat of the debates.\n", "toc": [{"#OutwGoodNoseInfe": "1.

Outweighing Goods and Noseeum Inferences\n\nSkeptical theism is a cluster of responses to arguments from evil. One\nmajor argument from evil is what we\u2019ll call the\n\u201cOutweighing Goods\u201d argument. This section explains a\nbasic outweighing goods argument, a standard way of defending it using\n\u201cnoseeum inferences,\u201d and a skeptical theistic critique of\nthat defense.\n1.1 Basic Outweighing Goods Argument\n\nA simple thought is that if God exists, there would be no evil. After\nall, God could prevent any evil there is; God would know about any\nevil there is; and God would want to prevent any evil there is. But\nthis simple thought is too simple. For even if God exists, it need not\nbe the case that God wants to prevents any evil there is. For God may\nhave a justifying reason for permitting evil.\n\nFrequently, in life, agents are justified in permitting evil if there\nis some reason that justifies their permission of it. A common and\nwell-known kind of reason is that the permission of the evil is\nnecessary for either bringing about some greater good or preventing\nsome worse evil from occurring. (We\u2019ll use the term\n\u2018outweighing goods\u2019 to refer inclusively to the greater\ngoods or worse evils.) Indeed, the complexity of trading off\npermitting evils for outweighing goods is not just a part of\nconsequentialist thinking but pervades most ordinary ethical and legal\nthinking. There may be other kinds of reasons that justify an agent in\npermitting evil. (For instance, perhaps the agent does not have the\nappropriate authority to prevent the evil or the actions necessary to\nprevent the evil would go against the agent\u2019s character or\npersonal projects.) But justifying reasons involving outweighing goods\nhave dominated discussions of arguments from evil; so this entry will\nfocus on them. Keeping these points in mind, one important argument\nfrom evil is this (compare Rowe 1979, 1984, 1986; Martin 1978):\n\nNot-Outweighed\n\nN-O1.1\nIf God exists, then for any evil e, God is justified in\npermitting e only if God\u2019s permission of e is\nnecessary for some outweighing good.\nN-O1.2\nThere is at least one evil e such that God\u2019s\npermission of e is not necessary for some outweighing\ngood.\nN-O1.3\nTherefore, there is no God.\n\n\n\nThis argument is deductive; thus, defenses of it focus primarily on\nthe premises. N-O1.1 is seen as a\nplausible claim articulating God\u2019s obligations to the rest of\nus. N-O1.2 is an existential claim,\nstating that some evil is, crudely put, not outweighed. A\nstraightforward way of defending it is existential generalization:\nfind specific evils such that God\u2019s permission of them\nis not necessary for some outweighing good, and then generalize to\nN-O1.2.\n1.2 Noseeum Inferences\n\nConsider two situations given in the literature: a fawn, caught in a\nforest fire, that burned to death (cf. Rowe 1979), and a five-year-old\ngirl who was raped and then strangled to death (cf. Russell 1989).\nTheir sufferings are paradigms of evil. Now one might reflect on their\nsuffering, and try hard to identify God\u2019s reasons for permitting\ntheir suffering. An important sub-argument for\nN-O1.2 follows:\n\nNot-Outweighed\n\nN-O1.21\nAfter extensive reflection, it seems that there is no outweighing\ngood that would justify God\u2019s permission of the fawn\u2019s\nsuffering and the girl\u2019s suffering.\nN-O1.22\nTherefore, it is prima facie reasonable to believe that\nthere is no outweighing good that would justify God\u2019s permission\nof the fawn\u2019s suffering and the girl\u2019s suffering.\nN-O1.2\nThere is at least one evil e such that God\u2019s\npermission of e is not necessary for some outweighing\ngood.\n\n\n\nThis argument is not valid, but inductive in nature. In defense of\nN-O1.21, authors like Rowe argue that the\nsuffering of the fawn and the girl seem unconnected from the concerns\nof traditional theodicies. Their suffering isn\u2019t the result of\ntheir own free will, for instance; nor does their suffering contribute\nto their \u201csoul-building\u201d of creating a superior moral\ncharacter. And while eternal union with God may be extremely good, it\nis hard to see how this suffering would be connected to it. Reflecting\non their suffering, it is hard to identify outweighing goods that\nwould justify God\u2019s permission of that suffering.\n\nThis way of defending N-O1.2 is sometimes\ncalled a \u201cnoseeum\u201d inference (Wykstra 1996). From the\nclaim that we \u201cno see\u201d an outweighing good, one infers\nthat there is no such outweighing good and, thus, there is no God.\n(Wykstra\u2019s inspiration for this term comes from the name of an\ninsect \u2013 a \u2018no-see-um\u2019 \u2013 that is normally too\nsmall to be seen, but can still leave a nasty welt.) Alternatively,\nthis way of defending N-O1.2 is called an\nargument from \u201cfailure of theodicy\u201d (Draper 2013), since\nit is the apparent failure of theodicies that make\nN-O1.2 reasonable to believe.\n1.3 CORNEA-based Criticisms\n\nSome skeptical theists critique noseeum arguments by using what is\ncalled a CORNEA-based criticism (Wykstra 1984, 1996). Like many\nskeptical theistic critiques, this critique has two components\u2014a\ngeneral epistemic principle and some claims in philosophy of religion.\nBy combining the two components, skeptical theists aim to undermine\nsome argument.\n\nThe term \u2018CORNEA\u2019 is an unprincipled acronym: Condition On\nReasoNable Epistemic Access. A CORNEA principle is an epistemic\nprinciple stating conditions on when it is reasonable for a person to\nclaim or believe p on the basis of something q.\nWykstra himself formulated a range of principles that are not\nobviously equivalent. A simple CORNEA principle is:\n\nSimple-CORNEA (S-C)\n\nA person is prima facie reasonable in believing p on\nthe basis of q only if, given their cognitive abilities, it\nis reasonable for them to believe that if p were different,\nthen q would likely be different as well.\n\nTo illustrate the plausibility of CORNEA principles, consider the\nfollowing case. A doctor accidentally drops a needle on the floor. The\ndoctor picks up the needle, visually inspects it, and announces that\nthe needle is free of viruses and bacteria. Is the doctor prima\nfacie reasonable in believing the needle is free of viruses and\nbacteria on the basis of his visual experience? Intuitively not. A\nprinciple like S-C is well-suited to explain why. It\nis not reasonable for the doctor to believe that, given his cognitive\nabilities, if the needle were contaminated with bacteria or viruses,\nthen his visual experience would likely be different as well.\n\nA CORNEA principle like S-C is a general epistemic\nprinciple that can be applied to any range of cases. Skeptical theists\napply it to the inference from N-O1.21 to\nN-O1.22. Suppose we are prima\nfacie reasonable in believing that God\u2019s permission of the\nfawn\u2019s suffering and the girl\u2019s suffering would not be\nnecessary for some outweighing good on the basis of our failure to see\nan outweighing good connected to their suffering by reflecting. Then,\nby S-C, it must be reasonable for us to believe that\nif God\u2019s permission of the fawn\u2019s suffering and the\ngirl\u2019s suffering were necessary for some outweighing\ngood, then we would likely not fail to identify an outweighing good\nconnected to their suffering by reflecting.\n\nBut skeptical theists argue that this is not reasonable for\nus to believe. That is, they argue that even if God\u2019s permission\nof the fawn\u2019s suffering and the girl\u2019s suffering were\nnecessary for some outweighing good, then it is likely that we would\nfail to identify an outweighing good connected to their suffering\nsimply by reflecting. Skeptical theists give analogies to support\nthese claims. One extended analogy is a parent/child analogy (compare\nWykstra 1984: 88; 1996: 142\u20135). A baby infant is in no position\nto evaluate its parent\u2019s plans for its life. But our cognitive\nabilities are like a baby infant\u2019s in comparison to God\u2019s.\nSo too, we are in no position to evaluate all of God\u2019s plans.\nSimilarly, parents with increased intelligence, understanding of\ngoods, and abilities are more likely to plan for goods in their\nchildren\u2019s future\u2014a future which their children are not\nyet able to see. God, having maximum intelligence, understanding, and\nability, is thus likely to make plans where many goods will be in the\nfuture in ways we cannot expect to understand. Another analogy\ninvolves the \u201cphysical depth\u201d of the universe (cf. Russell\nand Wykstra 1988: 146\u20138; see also Alston 1991 [1996]: 109). If\nGod created the universe, God created it with \u201cphysical\ndepth,\u201d where many of the features of the universe are difficult\nto learn about. So too, if God has plans for creation, God is likely\nto have created it with \u201cmoral depth,\u201d where many of the\ngoods that play a role in God\u2019s plan are not\n\u201csurface\u201d goods easily identified but rather more obscure\nto\n us.\n\n\nThus, by S-C, believing\nN-O1.22 on the basis of\nN-O1.21 is reasonable only if it is\nreasonable to believe that, given our cognitive faculties, if\nGod\u2019s permission of their suffering were necessary for an\noutweighing good, we\u2019d identify that good by reflecting. But\nthat\u2019s not reasonable for us to believe\u2014even if there is\nan outweighing good justifying God\u2019s permission of their\nsuffering, then we likely wouldn\u2019t see it by reflecting. So\nit\u2019s not reasonable to believe\nN-O1.22 on the basis of\nN-O1.21. Thus, according to this line of\nreasoning, the sub-argument for N-O1.2\nfails.\n2. Outweighing Goods and Inductive Inferences\n\nOne of the key claims of the outweighing goods argument is\nN-O1.2: there is at least one evil e such\nthat God\u2019s permission of e is not necessary for some outweighing\ngood. One way of defending this premise is to appeal to how things\nseem to us. But another way to defend\nN-O1.2 is to eschew talk of how things\nseem to us and use more traditional inductive inferences.\n2.1 Representative-based Inductive Inferences\n\nSuppose I have a garden. I like spicy food, so every year I plant hot\npeppers. I plant a variety of hot peppers\u2014differences in size,\nheat-level, place of origin, etc. And suppose that each year I notice\nthat my hot peppers only begin flowering in late summer, early\nfall\u2014never early spring. I might reason as follows:\n\nNo-Known-Pepper (NKP)\n\nNo hot pepper I know of flowers in early spring.\n\nNone-at-all-Pepper (NaaP)\n\nTherefore, no hot pepper at all flowers in early spring.\n\nThe reasoning in this case is inductive. I have a sample\nsize\u2014hot peppers I know of\u2014and they have a certain\nproperty\u2014they don\u2019t flower in early spring. I infer from\nthis sample size to a larger group\u2014all hot peppers\u2014that\nthey have the same property. Since my sample size is representative of\nthe larger group, this inductive inference is a reasonable one.\n\nAnalogously, suppose we consider whether we know of any outweighing\ngoods that would justify God\u2019s permission of the girl\u2019s\nsuffering and the fawn\u2019s suffering. We are familiar with a\nvariety of outweighing goods in life. Suppose we think that none of\nthe outweighing goods we know of would justify God\u2019s permission\nof the girl\u2019s suffering and the fawn\u2019s suffering. We might\nreason inductively as follows (compare Rowe (1988, 1991):\n\nNo-Known-Goods (NKG)\n\nNo outweighing goods we know of would justify God\u2019s permission\nof the fawn\u2019s suffering and the girl\u2019s suffering\n\nNone-at-all-Goods (NaaG)\n\nTherefore, no outweighing goods at all would justify God\u2019s\npermission of the fawn\u2019s suffering and the girl\u2019s\nsuffering.\n\nFrom NaaG it is a short-step to\nN-O1.2 and then atheism. This way of\ndefending N-O1.2 avoids noseeum inferences\nand so might be thought to side-step the CORNEA-based criticisms of\nthe previous section.\n2.2 Representative Goods\n\nSkeptical theists have critiqued the inference from\nNKG to NaaG (see Alston 1991 [1996],\n1996; Christlieb 1992: 48\u201354; Sennett 1993; Bergmann 2001). Once\nagain, the critique can usefully be divided into two parts\u2014an\nepistemological principle and some claims in philosophy of\nreligion.\n\nSkeptical theists have spent less time developing the epistemic\nprinciple used in this critique. But they assume a principle something\nlike this: an inference from a sample of a group to the group\nvis-\u00e0-vis some property is reasonable only if one is\nin a position to reasonably believe that the sample is representative\nof the group vis-\u00e0-vis that property. (See Alston\n1996: 326\u20137; Howard-Snyder 1996b: 297\u20139; Tucker 2014:\n49ff.) for worries about how best to formulate such a principle.)\nAgain, this principle can be intuitively supported by cases. If I\nplant in my garden only one kind of pepper\u2014say,\nhabaneros\u2014then it would be unreasonable and irresponsible for me\nto generalize to all kinds of hot peppers.\n\nSkeptical theists then apply something like that principle to the\ninference from NKG to NaaG. It is\nreasonable to infer NaaG from NKG\nonly if it is reasonable for us to believe that the outweighing goods\nwe know of are representative of all potential outweighing goods when\nit comes to the property of justifying God\u2019s permission of\nevil.\n\nBut skeptical theists argue that it is not reasonable for us\nto believe that. Some skeptical theists reason by analogy. Sometimes,\nit is reasonable to believe our sample size is representative because\nit is sufficiently large and chosen at random. Other times, we have\nalready \u201ccharted\u201d the relevant group and we know what\nproportion our sample is from that group. But these are not the case\nhere. The outweighing goods we know of aren\u2019t picked at random.\nNor have we \u201ccharted\u201d the relevant group of all possible\nGod-justifying outweighing goods. The standard techniques for\ngenerating representative samples don\u2019t seem to apply to\nNKG.\n\nBergmann summarizes these ideas in a more careful statement as follows\n(2001: 279; cf. 2009: 376):\n\nST1\nWe have no good reason for thinking that the possible goods we\nknow of are representative of the possible goods there are.\nST2\nWe have no good reason for thinking that the possible evils we\nknow of are representative of the possible evils there are.\nST3\nWe have no good reason for thinking that the entailment relations\nwe know of between possible goods and the permission of possible evils\nare representative of the entailment relations there are between\npossible goods and the permission of possible evils.\n\n\nNotice that these theses do not claim that we have good\nreason for thinking they are not representative. They are\nmore skeptical than that. Bergmann sees these claims as independently\nplausible, so that both theists and non-theists should endorse them,\nwriting: \u201cit just doesn\u2019t seem unlikely that our\nunderstanding of the realm of value falls miserably short of capturing\nall that is true about that realm. One can recognize this even if one\nis not a theist.\u201d (2001: 279).\n\nThus, given a relevant epistemic principle, the inference from\nNKG to NaaG is reasonable only if it\nis reasonable to believe that the outweighing goods we know of are\nrepresentative of all outweighing goods when it comes to justifying\nGod\u2019s permission of evil. But, skeptical theists argue, that is\nnot reasonable for us to believe. So the inference from\nNKG to NaaG is not reasonable. Thus,\nthis representation-based inductive argument for\nN-O1.2 also fails.\n2.3 Connecting Goods\n\nSkeptical theists object to the inference from NKG to\nNaaG. But some skeptical theists also object directly\nto NKG (see Alston 1996: 315-6; Plantinga 1998: 53;\nBergmann 2009: 382). Given ST3, it may be\nthat some outweighing goods we know of would justify\nGod\u2019s permissions of the fawn\u2019s suffering and the\ngirl\u2019s suffering. It may simply be that the connection between\nthe outweighing goods we are familiar with and God\u2019s permission\nof suffering is not known to us. Again, skeptical theists might appeal\nto analogies to clarify their position. A novice chess player knows\nthat a grandmaster\u2019s objective is to win the game. But it\ndoesn\u2019t follow that the novice chess player understands how each\nmove the grandmaster makes might contribute to the grandmaster\u2019s\nobjective. In fact, it might even seem to the novice player that\nvarious moves by the grandmaster don\u2019t contribute to that\nobjective at all.\n3. Noseeum Arguments\n\nNoseeum evils (or seemingly unjustified evils) are a type of\nevil\u2014evils such that God\u2019s permission of them do not seem\nnecessary for an outweighing good. One might argue that those evils\nare good evidence for another type of evil that is inconsistent with\nthe existence of God\u2014evils such that God\u2019s permission of\nthem would not be necessary for an outweighing good.\nAlternatively, one might argue that noseeum evils are evidence against\ntheism on their own\u2014regardless of whether or not they are also\nevidence for evils of another kind. This section looks at two\narguments of that kind and skeptical theistic critiques of them.\n3.1 Individual Case Argument\n\nTo understand the first argument, some background in confirmation\ntheory will be useful. On one standard understanding, a claim \\(E\\) is\nevidence against a hypothesis \\(H\\) just in case the probability of\n\\(H,\\) given \\(E,\\) is less than the probability of \\(H\\) on its own.\nMore formally: \\(E\\) is evidence against \\(H\\) just in case \\(Pr(H\\mid\nE) \\lt Pr(H)\\). Furthermore, the lower the difference between\n\\(Pr(H\\mid E)\\) and \\(Pr(H),\\) the stronger \\(E\\) is evidence\nagainst \\(H\\). To determine if \\(E\\) is evidence against \\(H,\\) one\nconsiders two key conditional probabilities: first, the probability of\n\\(E\\) given \\(H,\\) and second, the probability of \\(E\\) given the\ndenial of \\(H\\). More formally, \\(Pr(E\\mid H)\\) and \\(Pr(E\\mid \\neg\nH),\\) respectively. Now if \\(Pr(E\\mid \\neg H)\\) is greater than\n\\(Pr(E\\mid H)\\) then \\(E\\) will be evidence against \\(H\\). And the\ngreater \\(Pr(E\\mid \\neg H)\\) is than \\(Pr(E\\neg H)\\) the stronger\n\\(E\\) will be evidence against \\(H\\).\n\nNext, reconsider:\n\nNo-Known-Goods (NKG)\n\nNo outweighing goods we know of would justify God\u2019s permission\nof the fawn\u2019s suffering and the girl\u2019s suffering.\n\n(We\u2019ll ignore the objection of 2.3 and assume\nNKG is true.) NKG is a noseeum\nclaim, since it asserts that we \u201cno see\u201d any outweighing\ngoods that would justify God\u2019s permission of that specific\nsuffering. To determine if NKG is evidence against\ntheism, we need to consider two conditional probabilities: how likely\nis it given the denial of theism and how likely is it given theism.\nRowe (1996: 267\u201370) argues that the probability of\nNKG given atheism is 1. For if there is no God, then\nGod doesn\u2019t permit anything. Thus, if there is no God, then\nnothing justifies God\u2019s permission of anything, since God\ndoesn\u2019t permit anything. Thus, if there is no God, then no\noutweighing good we know of would justify God\u2019s permission of\nanything\u2014including the fawn\u2019s suffering and the\ngirl\u2019s suffering.\n\nIf the probability of NKG given atheism is 1, then\nthe lower probability it has given theism, the stronger the evidence\nNKG is against theism. And one might argue that the\nprobability of NKG given theism is not high\u2014at\nleast below 0.5\u2014because God would not let us suffer in silence.\nThat is, if God permitted the suffering of the fawn and the girl for\nsome outweighing good, then God would at least tell us what those\ngoods are or\u2014if that\u2019s not possible for whatever\nreason\u2014at least offer some kind of comfort for the suffering in\nsome way (cf. Rowe 2006: 86\u20137). So given theism, we\nshouldn\u2019t expect that no good we know of would justify\nGod\u2019s permission of these evils\u2014God would tell us about\nthose goods or at least comfort us.\n\nSkeptical theists object to this argument that the probability of\nNKG, given theism, is not high (cf. Bergmann 2001).\nPresumably, God would not let us suffer in silence because such\nsilence serves no outweighing good. But it is hard to see how one\ncould establish that it serves no outweighing good, if\nST1 and ST2\nare true. After all, even if no good we know of would justify God\nletting us suffer in silence, given ST1\nand ST2, it would not be reasonable to\ninfer that no such good would. So this argument fails to show that\nNKG is not high given theism.\n3.2 Cumulative Case Argument\n\nAn alternative argumentative strategy doesn\u2019t focus on\nindividual cases of evils that seem such that God\u2019s permission\nof them is unnecessary for an outweighing good. Rather, it focuses on\na larger class of such evils. One kind of argument that focuses on a\nlarger class of these evils is a cumulative case argument like\nthis:\n\nNoseeum\n\nN1.1\nEach individual seemingly unjustified evil is, on its own, slight\ndisconfirming evidence against theism.\nN1.2\nThere are many seemingly unjustified evils.\nN1.3\nTherefore, the collection of all seemingly unjustified evils is\nstrong evidence against theism.\nN1.4\nTherefore, theism is probably false.\n\n\n\nBut some skeptical theists object to N1.1\non general methodological grounds (see Perrine and Wykstra 2014:\n157\u2013163). Evidence of a specific type might disconfirm a\nhypothesis by eliminating some specific version of that hypothesis\nthat does not fit that type of evidence. But that evidence won\u2019t\ndisconfirm other specific versions of that hypothesis that do fit that\ntype of evidence. Thus, evidence of the same type might initially\ndisconfirm a hypothesis by eliminating specific versions of it; but\nthat type of evidence won\u2019t continue disconfirming that\nhypothesis, since the only remaining versions of the hypothesis\naccommodate that evidence. To give an example, the sun rises and sets\nevery day. This type of evidence disconfirms heliocentrism by\ndisconfirming a specific version of heliocentrism on which the earth\nrevolves around the sun while always facing the sun. But this type of\nevidence won\u2019t disconfirm other versions of heliocentrism on\nwhich the earth revolves around the sun, but regularly spins on an\naxis. Thus, the sun rising and setting each day might initially\ndisconfirm heliocentrism\u2014by eliminating some versions of\nheliocentrism\u2014but that type of evidence won\u2019t continue\ndisconfirming heliocentrism. For the remaining versions of\nheliocentrism fit that type of evidence.\n\nAnalogously, some skeptical theists might allow that the existence of\nsome seemingly unjustified evils disconfirms theism. Insofar as they\ndo disconfirm theism, it is by disconfirming specific versions of\ntheism on which God always explains, or indicates, the justifying\nreasons for the permission of evils. But the existence of seemingly\nunjustified evils won\u2019t disconfirm versions of theism on which\nGod\u2019s justifying reasons for permitting suffering are\nfrequently, even normally, beyond our ken. Thus, this type of\nevidence\u2014the existence of seemingly unjustified\nevils\u2014might disconfirm some versions of theism but won\u2019t\ndisconfirm other versions of theism. So, it won\u2019t be the case\nthat each seemingly unjustified evil is slight disconfirmation for\ntheism in general and N1.1 is false.\n4. Skeptical Theism and Other Responses\n\nSkeptical theism is one family of responses to arguments from evil.\nBut there are a number of other responses. Following Plantinga\u2019s\nterminology (1974: 28), a theodicy purports to provide\nGod\u2019s justifying reasons for permitting suffering and evil. By\ncontrast, a defense purports to provide potential reasons\nthat would justify God\u2019s permission of suffering and evil, even\nif those reasons may not be God\u2019s own. By contrast, a skeptical\ntheistic critique does not offer God\u2019s actual or potential\njustifying reasons for permitting suffering and evil. Indeed,\nskeptical theists oftentimes find themselves agreeing with\natheologians that they cannot identify connections between potential\ngoods and evils that would justify God\u2019s permission of specific\nevils.\n\nInitially, it may seem that there is a tension, if not inconsistency,\nbetween skeptical theism on the one hand and defense and theodicies on\nthe other (compare Stump 2010: 13\u20135; Coley 2015). However, there\nare many types of arguments from evil, utilizing different facts about\nevil. For the same argument from evil, utilizing specific facts about\nevil, it may be inconsistent to combine responses. That is, it may be\ninconsistent to respond with both (i) we know of reasons that do (or\ncould) justify God\u2019s permission of that type of evil and (ii) we\ndon\u2019t know of any reasons that do (or could) justify God\u2019s\npermission of that type of evil. But some skeptical theists (e.g.\nPerrine and Wykstra 2014; DePoe 2014: 33) suggest that it may be\nreasonable to use different responses for different arguments from\nevil. Whether skeptical theistic critiques can be combined with other\nresponses to various arguments from evil is a place in the literature\nthat needs more attention.\n\nMany authors who utilize skeptical theistic critiques also assume that\nGod has obligations to us. That is, they tend to assume that God is\npermitted in letting us experience suffering and evil only if God has\nsome kind of justifying reason. Many skeptical theists accept\nN-O1.1; they assume the justifying reason\nmust involve outweighing goods. Others might reject\nN-O1.1. Nonetheless, they think God must\nstill have some kind of justifying reason; the reason just may not\ninvolve outweighing goods (compare van Inwagen 2006 (lecture 6),\nMooney 2019). The claim that God has obligations to us is not normally\na requirement of skeptical theistic critiques. Nonetheless, the\nparticular way that skeptical theists critique arguments from evil\nindicates they assume that God does have obligations to us.\n\nRecently, there have been other, more extreme responses to arguments\nfrom evil that deny that God has obligations to us. Various arguments\nhave been offered for this view (see Adams (2013) and Murphy (2017)\nfor some representative examples). But these responses deny that from\nthe claim that God exist it necessarily follows that God would promote\ngoods, prevent evils, or permit evils only if God has a justifying\nreason. These responses may be technically consistent with skeptical\ntheistic responses, since the different responses will frequently\nobject to distinct premises. Nonetheless, these responses do not sit\nwell with the assumptions skeptical theists tend to bring to bear in\nevaluating arguments from evil.\n5. Epistemological Objections\n\nA number of authors have raised epistemological objections to\nskeptical theism. Some of these objections are to the epistemic\nprinciples skeptical theists use. Others are that the claims of\nskeptical theistic critiques may, themselves, produce skeptical\nproblems.\n5.1 Objections to CORNEA Principles\n\nCORNEA principles state a necessary condition on it being reasonable\nto claim or believe p on the basis of something q.\nThe condition (roughly) is that it is also reasonable for one to\nbelieve that, given one\u2019s cognitive faculties, if p\nwere different, then q would likely be different as well. A\nstandard worry for epistemic principles like this is that they will\ncreate an infinite regress (cf. Alston 1980, Fumerton 1995 (chapter\n2), Leite 2008). And some have objected to CORNEA principles for\nexactly this reason (Swinburne 1998: 32\u20133). To see how the\nregress might go, suppose I\u2019m reasonable in believing p\non the basis of q. Then, by a CORNEA principle, I am also\nreasonable in believing that, given my cognitive faculties, if\np were false, then q would likely be different. But\nsuppose that belief is reasonable but based on something\nr. Well, applying a CORNEA principle again, it must be\nreasonable for me to believe that, were that belief different, then\nr would likely be different\u2026 ad\ninfinitum.\n\nA different objection is that CORNEA-principles are inconsistent with\nforming reasonable beliefs on the basis of inductive evidence\n(McBrayer 2009; Almeida 2014: 122ff). For instance, suppose the day\ncare center informs me that each day, for the past three months, my\nchild has been sleeping during nap time. On the basis of this\ninductive evidence, it is reasonable for me to infer that\ntoday my child will sleep during nap time. But if my child\nwere not sleeping during nap time today, would my inductive\nevidence be different? Using standard possible-world semantics, it\nwould not. For in the closest worlds in which my child is not\nsleeping, it is likely a fluke or random event. And in those worlds, I\nwould still have my inductive evidence from the past. Thus, in this\ncase, S-C implies that it is not reasonable\nto infer my child is sleeping today on the basis of my inductive\nevidence. But this example of inductive reasoning is not particularly\ndistinctive. So S-C is inconsistent with forming\nreasonable beliefs on the basis of inductive evidence.\n\nSeveral attempts have been made to clarify CORNEA-principles in ways\nthat avoids these problems while still being strong enough for\nresponding to arguments from evil (see Wykstra 1996, 2007; Wykstra and\nPerrine 2012; Perrine 2022). One clarification is that CORNEA\nprinciples are restricted to a specific kind of case: where the\ngrounds or evidence for belief is \u201clevering evidence,\u201d\nwhich is (crudely put) evidence strong enough to reasonably\n\u201clever\u201d one from agnosticism or disbelief about p\nto belief about p. The restriction of CORNEA-principles to\nthis type of evidence or grounds is appropriate, since it is the kind\nof evidence that Rowe (1979) initially tried to provide. Restricting\nCORNEA-principles in this way may also block an infinite regress,\nsince the CORNEA-principles are not fully general. A second\nclarification is that the condition in CORNEA-principles should\nnot be interpreted as involving a subjunctive-conditional,\nbut rather a conditional probability. That is, the condition is that\nit is reasonable to believe, given one\u2019s cognitive faculties,\nthat the conditional probability of one\u2019s grounds or evidence,\ngiven one\u2019s belief is false, is below .5. Though some of the\ndetails are technical, Wykstra and Perrine argue that a probabilistic\nunderstanding of CORNEA\u2019s requirement handles cases of inductive\nevidence. But whether or not these clarifications ultimately help\ndefuse objections is still a topic of debate. (For further discussion\nof CORNEA-principles, see Howard-Snyder (1992), Graham and Maitzen\n(2007), Stone (2011), Draper (2014a).)\n5.2 Common Sense Epistemology\n\nSome authors have worried that skeptical theism is inconsistent with\n\u201cCommon Sense Epistemology\u201d (see Dougherty 2008). More\nprecisely, some might worry that the epistemological principles used\nin skeptical theistic critiques are inconsistent with epistemological\nprinciples that are part of Common Sense Epistemology. Such principles\ninclude Swinburne\u2019s Principle of Credulity (2004: 303ff.) and\nHuemer\u2019s Phenomenal Conservativism (2001: 99):\n\nPrinciple of Credulity\n\nIf it seems to a subject S that p, this is good\ngrounds for S to believe p.\n\nPhenomenal Conservativism\n\nIf it seems to a subject S that p, then S\nis prima facie justified in believing p.\n\nOne might object to skeptical theism by arguing that these principles\nof Common Sense Epistemology are true, and thus their inconsistency\nwith skeptical theism is a problem for skeptical theism.\n\nIn response, some authors argue that skeptical theistic critiques are\nconsistent with various principles of Common Sense Epistemology. For\neven if one is prima facie justified in believing something,\none\u2019s prima facie justification might be defeated. For\ninstance, I may be prima facie justified in believing my\nboss\u2019 explanation of the new departmental policy just because he\nsaid as much; but that prima facie justification might be\ndefeated when I recall the many times he has misled me about such\npolicies. So too, skeptical theistic critiques might permit that\nindividuals are prima facie justified in believing things\nlike N-O1.2. Nonetheless, that prima\nfacie justification is defeated by considering skeptical theistic\ncritiques of arguments from evil. (For discussion, see Matheson 2011,\n2014; McBrayer and Swenson 2012: 147; Coffman 2014: 83\u20134; Tweedt\n2015; Rutledge 2017a; Hendricks 2018.)\n\nAlternatively, other authors argue that the epistemological principles\nof skeptical theistic critiques are inconsistent with various\nprinciples of Common Sense Epistemology (see Wykstra 1984, Senor 2013,\nPerrine 2022). These authors argue that the inconsistency is not a\nproblem for skeptical theistic critiques because those principles are\nfalse. For instance, Perrine argues that there are reasons independent\nof arguments from evil for thinking that these various principles of\nCommon Sense Epistemology are false. For those principles are\nconsistent with an agent having prima facie justification for\nbelieving something even if the belief was not formed in a responsible\nor reliable manner.\n5.3 External World Skepticism\n\nA frequent criticism of skeptical theism is that it leads to\nskepticism about the external world (see Russell and Wykstra 1988:\n158\u20139; Weisberger 2007: 170\u2013171; Wilks 2013; Law 2017;\nRussell 2017; 2018: 111ff). This criticism turns on the possibility of\ndivine deception. More specifically, consider the following\nhypothesis:\n\nDeceiving God (DG)\n\nGod is deceiving us into believing the earth is extremely old, when in\nreality it is quite young.\n\nIf DG is true, then we are mistaken about the age of\nthe earth. Now atheists can reject DG because it\nimplies God exists; but clearly theists who are skeptical theists\ncannot reject DG for that reason. Theists, who are\nnot skeptical theists, might reject DG by reasoning\nas follows: we can see no reason that would justify God in deceiving\nus in this way; so there is no such reason. But theists who are\nskeptical theists cannot rely on that line of reasoning. After all, as\nlearned from their critiques of noseeum inferences, from the mere fact\nthat it seems to us that God has no reason to (e.g.) deceive us about\nthe age of the earth, it does not yet follow that we are prima\nface justified in believing God has no reason to deceive us about\nthe age of the earth. So skeptical theists who are theists cannot use\neither of these line of reasoning to rule out DG. But\nthis claim about the age of the earth is merely illustrative of any\nnumber of claims about the external world. Thus, skeptical theists who\nare theists cannot use either of these lines of reasoning to rule out\nany number of skeptical hypothesis about the external world that\ninvolve divine deception.\n\nOne type of response is to argue that, for skeptical theists to know\nabout the external world, they do not have to first rule out\nhypotheses like DG. Otherwise put, there are other\nroutes to knowledge about the external world that don\u2019t involve\ninferences about potential divine deception (cf. Bergmann 2009: 391;\n2012: 15). For instance, skeptical theists might embrace externalism\nabout knowledge. According to that position, in order for one to know\nfacts about the external world, one does not need to have access to\nwhat explains that one knows. Thus, one could know facts about the\nexternal world without producing an argument or first ruling out that\none is not being deceived (cf. Bergmann 2008, Hendricks 2020). But\nthere are other routes skeptical theists might explore. For instance,\nthey might accept theories of perception on which we are antecedently\njustified in trusting our perceptual experiences, unless we are given\nevidence that our experiences are misleading in some way (cf. Boyce\n2014). Such antecedent justification need not require first ruling out\nskeptical hypotheses like DG.\n5.4 Religious Skepticism\n\nA similar objection is that skeptical theism leads to religious\nskepticism (Beaudoin 2000, 2005; Rowe 2006: 90\u20131; Wielenberg\n2010; Hudson 2014). Skeptical theists might respond to the previous\ncriticism by claiming that we have many ways of knowing about the\nexternal world that don\u2019t, on the face of them, involve God\ntelling us something and not deceiving us. But a staple of many\nreligious traditions is that there are certain things we know about\nonly because God has told us. For instance, consider a claim\nlike:\n\nAfterlife (Af)\n\nThere is an eternal afterlife of union with God, full of bliss and\nfree of suffering.\n\nMany religious traditions hold that, insofar as we know or are\nreasonable in believing Af, it is only because God\nhas told us, revealing it to us through a prophet, text, or direct\nreligious experience.\n\nCritics argue that theists who are skeptical theists are not\nreasonable in believing Af. The criticism here\nmirrors the one of the previous section. It is possible that God is\ndeceiving us about these matters; but skeptical theists are unable to\nreasonably rule out the possibility of divine deception. Additionally,\nin the case of the external world, agents may have a variety of ways\nof coming to know about the external world. But that kind of response\nis less plausible here. Since it seems that for claims like\nAf, our only way of knowing them is to\ndepend upon God\u2014and depend upon God not deceiving us.\n\nA different type of criticism focuses on knowledge of God\u2019s\ncommands. One starting point for this criticism is that many religious\ntexts and traditions contain a wide range of commands that purport to\nbe divine commands (Maitzen 2007). Nevertheless, most religious\nadherents do not think they are obligated to follow all of those\npurported commands. Perhaps the commands are issued by the wrong text\nor tradition; or perhaps the commands had been\n\u201csuperseded\u201d or \u201cupdated\u201d by God; or perhaps\nthe commands seem to be issued by God but couldn\u2019t be\ngiven the immoral content of the commands; or maybe the commands are\njust plain silly or arbitrary.\n\nA natural way that a theist might sift through these purported\ncommands is to consider what God would have reason to command. If the\ntheist sees no reason why God would command (e.g.) not cooking goat in\nits mother\u2019s milk, then the theist might conclude that such a\ncommand is not actually God\u2019s. But this way of reasoning about\ndivine commands looks incredibly similar to the noseeum argument for\nN-O1.2! Thus, if theists who are skeptical\ntheists are skeptical about whether that noseeum inference is\nreasonable, so too they should be skeptical that this\ninference about God\u2019s commands is reasonable as well.\n6. Moral Objections\n\nA number of authors have argued that skeptical theism\u2014especially\nwhen combined with theism\u2014leads to various forms of moral\nproblems, including moral skepticism. However, there are several\ndistinct criticisms that are not always distinguished. I will\ndistinguish three important objections involving morality.\n6.1 Moral Deliberation\n\nOne criticism is that theists who accept skeptical theism should\ndeliberate about acting in problematic ways (see Almeida and Oppy\n2003: 505\u20137; Piper 2007: 71ff; Rancourt 2013). More\nspecifically, they should reason that they should never intervene in\npreventing seemingly unjustified evils, even if it would be easy for\nthem to do so. For (as theists) they believe that for any seemingly\nunjustified evil, there is a justifying reason for it. They might fail\nto identify the justifying reason for some seemingly unjustified evil.\nBut (as skeptical theists) they do not regard this failure as\nproviding prima facie justification that the justifying\nreason does not exist. So they should reason that they should not\nintervene in preventing seemingly unjustified evils. But, the\nobjection goes, it is clearly unreasonable\u2014and\nimmoral\u2014to reason that we should never prevent a\npotential seemingly unjustified evil.\n\nThis basic objection can be extended. For instance, theists who are\nskeptical theists frequently believe that they have been commanded by\nGod to act in various ways. Thus, in some concrete situation, a theist\nwho is a skeptical theist may believe both that she should\nnot prevent the suffering (because of her skeptical theism)\nand that she should prevent the suffering (because of her\ntheism). The combination of her views leads to a kind of moral\nparalysis or aporia (see Piper 2007: 72\u20133). (Again, for\nthe reasons mentioned in section IV.3, atheists and theists who are\nnot skeptical theists have straightforward ways of resisting these\nobjections.)\n\nSkeptical theists have offered a number of responses. Some skeptical\ntheists who are theists claim that God has commanded them to act in\nvarious ways. Therefore, when deliberating about how to act, it is\nreasonable to prevent evils since they have been commanded by God to\nprevent evils (compare Bergmann and Rea 2005: 244\u20135, Schnall\n2007). This response requires knowledge or reasonable belief of\nGod\u2019s commands; but some critics of skeptical theism claim that\nskeptical theists who are theists do not have knowledge of God\u2019s\ncommands (see previous section).\n\nOther skeptical theists argue that the objection misrepresents their\nposition (Anderson 2012). Specifically, it neglects a distinction\nWykstra drew (1984: 75\u20136) between different justifications for\npermitting evil (cf. Alston 1991 [1996: 101]). God may be justified in\npermitting an evil because the evil itself is necessary for some\ngreater good. But it may be that God is justified in permitting an\nevil because the possibility of the evil\u2014that is, not preventing\nit\u2014is necessary for some good, such as developing moral\ncharacter. A parenting analogy is apt here. A parent is able to\nprevent an embarrassingly low score on her child\u2019s school work\nby forcing her child to do the homework. But by permitting the\npossibility of that low score, the parent gives her child an\nopportunity to achieve something of value\u2014a more responsible\ncharacter. In this case, the suffering\u2014the embarrassingly low\nscore\u2014is not necessary for any further good; rather, the\nparent\u2019s permission of it is necessary for a further good,\nnamely, increased responsibility. Thus, some skeptical theists reject\nthe claim that for any evil, there is a greater good that outweighs\nthat evil. Rather, God may permit some evil may occur, not because\nthat evil is necessary for some greater good, but because God\u2019s\npermission of it is.\n6.2 All-things-considered Value\n\nSome have objected that skeptical theism is committed to\nall-things-considered value skepticism (Jordan 2006, Hasker\n2010, Ekstrom 2021: ch. 4). Crudely put, the all-things-considered\nvalue of something\u2014a state of affairs, action, attitude,\netc.\u2014is the overall value or disvalue of it and all of its\nconsequences. Some have argued that if skeptical theism is true, then\nit is frequently not reasonable to make all-things-considered value\njudgements about specific things, that is, specific states of affairs,\nactions, attitudes, etc. Given skeptical theism, we are frequently\nreasonable in judging that some specific thing is on its own valuable\nor disvaluable, good or bad. But, the objection goes, we are not\nreasonable in judging that things have all-things-considered value.\nAgain, this objection might be extended to cases of obligations, since\nbeing unable to make reasonable all-things-considered value judgments\nmay also undermine knowledge of our obligations (see next\nsection).\n\nIn response, some skeptical theists concede their position undermines\ncertain ways of arriving at all-things-considered value judgments (cf.\nBergmann 2009: 379\u201380, 389; 2012: 25\u20136). Specifically,\njust as skeptical theistic claims undermine Rowe\u2019s nosseum\ninferences, so too they will undermine nosseum inferences that certain\nthings are all-things-considered valuable or disvaluable. But\nskeptical theists might also maintain that this all-things-considered\nvalue skepticism is unproblematic. One reason why it might be\nunproblematic is that there are reasons for accepting\nall-things-considered value skepticism independently of skeptical\ntheism. For instance, no one knows all of the causal consequences of\ntheir action. Thus, no one knows all of the valuable or disvaluable\nconsequences of their actions. Thus, no one knows the\nall-things-considered value of their actions. This line of reasoning\nsupports all-things-considered value skepticism, but does not assume\nthat skeptical theistic critiques are successful.\n6.3 All-things-considered Obligations\n\nMany authors have argued that skeptical theism leads to skepticism\nabout our obligations (see Jordan 2006: 409ff; Piper 2007: 68; Sehon\n2010; Maitzen 2013: 448\u2013451; Street 2014). Skeptical theists can\nbe reasonable in believing that certain things are good and bad; and\nskeptical theists can be reasonable in believing that agents have\ncertain pro tanto obligations (e.g. to bring about what is\ngood, prevent what is bad, keep our promises, etc.). But oftentimes in\nordinary life we take ourselves to reasonably believe\u2014if not\nknow\u2014what we ought to do, what our\nall-things-considered obligations are. And some authors argue\nthat skeptical theism leads to skepticism about our\nall-things-considered obligations.\n\nThe simplest form of this objection assumes maximizing act\nconsequentialism. According to that view, an agent ought to act to\nbring about the outcomes with the greatest possible good. However, if\nskeptical theists cannot be reasonable in forming beliefs about the\nall-things-considered value of outcomes, then they cannot be\nreasonable in believing which outcomes have the greatest possible\ngood. Thus, assuming maximizing act consequentialism, skeptical\ntheists cannot be reasonable in believing some action is the one they\nought to perform. But, arguably, skeptical theism leads to skepticism\nabout our all-things-considered obligations assuming other moral\ntheories as well. For instance, some robust forms of virtue ethics\nsuggest that agents ought to perform the action that a perfectly\nvirtuous person would perform; but presumably a perfectly virtuous\nperson would not neglect salient outcomes of their actions. Similarly,\nsome forms of Kantian ethics test moral principles by considering\nwhether \u201cuniversalizing\u201d them in various ways results in\nsome kind of contradiction; but presumably determining whether there\nis some kind of contradiction requires knowing the various outcomes of\nactions in those hypothetical scenarios.\n\nSkeptical theists might respond by drawing a distinction between\nconsiderations relevant to God\u2019s action and our own (compare\nHoward-Snyder 1996b: 292-3; Bergmann 2009: 393; Jeffrey 2019: section\n3.1.3). For all we know, our knowledge of good and evil is not\nrepresentative when it comes to considerations that determine what God\nought to do; but it may be that our knowledge of good and evil is\nrepresentative when it comes to considerations that determine what\nhumans ought to do. While this response may be promising, skeptical\ntheists haven\u2019t developed it at great lengths, and some critics\n(notably Street 2014) have argued it is less promising than it might\nseem.\n\nHoward-Synder (2009, 2014) offers a dilemma argument in defense of\nskeptical theism. On some moral theories, the facts that determine our\nall-things-considered obligations are frequently inaccessible to us.\n(Maximizing act consequentialism is one example.) Thus, given\nskeptical theism and those theories, we should frequently be in doubt\nabout our all-things-considered obligations\u2014but not in virtue of\nskeptical theism, but rather in virtue of those theories. By contrast,\non other moral theories, the facts that determine our\nall-things-considered obligations are frequently accessible to us.\nThus, given skeptical theism and those theories, we frequently should\nnot be in doubt about our all-things-considered\nobligations\u2014but not in virtue of skeptical theism, but rather in\nvirtue of those theories. Either way, skeptical theism itself\ndoesn\u2019t lead to skepticism about our all-things-considered\nobligations.\n7. Scope of Skeptical Theism\n\nMany skeptical theistic critiques focus on \u201cnoseeum\u201d\ninferences. These inferences might be used to infer that God\u2019s\npermission of some evil lacks a justifying reason or even that there\nis no God. A natural thought is that skeptical theistic critiques, if\nsuccessful at all, are only successful against arguments that make a\n\u201cnoseeum\u201d inference. Other arguments from evil, using\nalternative lines of reasoning, may be immune from skeptical theistic\ncritiques. This natural thought is not a criticism of skeptical\ntheistic critiques per se. Rather, it suggests a certain\nlimitation of skeptical theistic critiques. Such critiques have a\nlimited scope in defending theism from arguments from evil.\n\nA number of authors have argued that there are arguments from evil\nthat are immune to skeptical theistic critiques. We next focus on\nthree types of arguments\u2014non-inferential arguments, Humean\narguments, and Hiddenness Arguments.\n7.1 Non-inferential Arguments\n\nNon-inferential arguments from evil begin with a standard observation.\nFor a given proposition, sometimes we can be either inferentially\njustified in believing it\u2014perhaps on the basis of some beliefs\nor argument\u2014or non-inferentially justified in believing it. For\ninstance, I am inferentially justified in believing my partner is home\nby inferring this from other things I am justified in believing like:\nthe door is unlocked, the mail has been taken, her keys are on the\nring, and her jacket is hanging on the wall, etc. But I can also be\nnon-inferentially justified in believing my partner is home by seeing\nher in the home as well.\n\nOne way of defending N-O1.2\u2014 there\nis at least one evil e such that God\u2019s permission of e is not\nnecessary for some outweighing good\u2014is inferentially, by giving\nan argument. Skeptical theists have critiqued various arguments for\nN-O1.2. But even if those critiques\nsucceed, then at best what follows is that we do not (yet!) have\ninferential justification for believing\nN-O1.2. But it is conceivable that we have\nnon-inferential justification for believing\nN-O1.2.\n\nHowever, a non-inferential argument from evil still needs to show that\nwe do have non-inferential justification for believing\nN-O1.2 (or a similar kind of claim). While\nthere might be a variety of ways of doing this (see Gellman 2013,\n2017), a simple and straightforward way is to appeal to epistemic\nprinciples of Common Sense Epistemology like Phenomenal Conservativism\n(see Tucker 2014: 58f; Ekstrom 2021: 103ff). However, this way of\ndefending a non-inferential argument from evil gets embroiled in the\nissues of section IV.2. Specifically, some skeptical theists will\nsimply reject the epistemic principles; others may concede them but\nargue that skeptical theistic critiques provide defeaters. Regardless,\nwhether or not non-inferential arguments from evil avoid skeptical\ntheistic critiques\u2014and are otherwise successful\u2014is one of\nthe more active areas of research on this topic in recent years.\n7.2 Humean Arguments\n\nSome of the most powerful arguments from evil are Humean arguments\nfrom evil (see Hume 1779 [2007], Draper 1989, Draper 1992:\n313\u2013317, Dougherty and Draper 2013, Morriston 2014). Humean\narguments have several distinctive features. First, they appeal to\nfacts about good and evil, such as the distribution of\npleasure and pain we observe. Second, they are comparative: they\ncompare theism with some alternative, inconsistent hypothesis like a\n\u201chypothesis of indifference\u201d (roughly: it is not the case\nthat life on earth as we observe it is the result of actions by either\na benevolent or maleficent creator). Third, they are normally\nabductive, arguing that the inconsistent hypothesis does a better job\nof explaining certain facts than theism.\n\nHumean arguments normally have a central premise like:\n\nDistribution (Dist)\n\nThe hypothesis of indifference does a much better job predicting the\ndistribution of pleasure and pain we observe than theism.\n\nOn its own, Dist isn\u2019t enough to make it\nreasonable to believe theism is false; after all, perhaps the\nhypothesis of indifference is worse off in other respects\u2014it is\nvery implausible or we have other excellent reasons for accepting\ntheism (cf. Plantinga 1996: 247\u2013250). So defenders of Humean\narguments normally add additional premises to their argument to show\nthat their rival to theism isn\u2019t worse off in other respects as\nwell (see Dougherty and Draper 2013: 69ff; Morriston 2014: 227). But\nthe inclusion of a comparative premise like Dist is\npart of what makes Humean arguments distinctive.\n\nDist may be defended in various ways. One standard\nway appeals to our background knowledge of the biological role of\npleasure and pain (Draper 1989). Simplifying, we antecedently know\nthat pleasure\u2014a good\u2014and pain\u2014an evil\u2014play\nbiological roles. For instance, pleasure will play a role in\nreinforcing adaptive behavior, whereas pain will play a role in\ndeterring non-adaptive behavior. The hypothesis of indifference does\nnot undermine predictions about the biological role of pleasure and\npain. But theism will. For given theism it is expectable that pleasure\nand pain would play additional roles beyond biological ones such as\nmoral or religious roles (e.g., the virtuous receive pleasure, the\nvicious pain). So theism, but not the hypothesis of indifference, will\nundermine the predictions about the biological role of pleasure and\npain. Further, the argument goes, those predictions are accurate.\nThus, the hypothesis of indifference does a better job of explaining\nDist than theism.\n\nMost skeptical theists object to claims like Dist by\nfocusing on what theism predicts or explains. Some skeptical theists\nexpress general skepticism of our ability to effectively compare these\nhypotheses. For instance, Perrine (2019) argues that if theism is\ntrue, then skeptical theistic claims\u2014like\nST1\u2013ST3\nfrom above\u2014are also very likely true. Thus, if\nDist is true, then so is:\n\nDistribution+ (Dist+)\n\nThe hypothesis of indifference does a much better job predicting the\ndistribution of pleasure and pain we observe than theism and skeptical\ntheistic claims.\n\nBut it is doubtful that we are able to effectively predict the\npleasure and pain we might observe given both theism and skeptical\ntheistic claims. For skeptical theistic claims undermine our ability\nto create precise enough predictions about theism to effectively\ncompare them with other hypotheses like the hypothesis of\nindifference.\n\nOther skeptical theistic critiques of Dist focus on\nspecific hypotheses that, it seems, we cannot reasonably rule out. For\ninstance, consider the following claim (compare Van Inwagen 1991\n[1996]; and 1996: 225\u2013234):\n\nNecessary Distribution (ND)\n\nA distribution of pleasure and pain for organisms similar to the one\nwe observe is necessary for great goods associated with higher-level\norganisms and for avoiding disvaluable worlds that are\nmassively irregular.\n\nIf ND is very probable, given theism, then it is not\nunlikely that we would observe a distribution of pleasure and\npain similar to the one we observe. For if theism is true, God likely\nwants to bring about various greater goods. But if ND\nis true, God couldn\u2019t bring about those greater goods without\nallowing for a distribution of pleasures and pains similar to the one\nwe observe. Thus, if ND is very probable, given\ntheism, then theism may predict the distribution of good and evil we\nobserve just as well as the hypothesis of indifference. Thus, if it is\nreasonable to believe Dist it must also be reasonable\nto believe that ND is not very probable,\ngiven theism. But that hypothesis\u2014that ND is\nnot very probable, given theism\u2014is not one we can reasonably\nrule out. To do that, we would have to have a greater understanding of\ngoods, evils, their connections to organisms, laws of natures,\nirregularities, etc. than we in fact have. So it is unreasonable to\nbelieve Dist, since to reasonably believe it we would\nhave to reasonably believe ND is not very probable\ngiven theism, and that\u2019s not reasonable for us to believe.\n7.3 Divine Hiddenness\n\nDivine hiddenness arguments use facts about the apparent\n\u201chiddenness\u201d or \u201cabsence\u201d or\n\u201csilence\u201d of God to argue against the existence of God\n(cf. Schellenberg 1993, 2007, 2015). A simple argument from divine\nhiddenness is:\n\nHiddenness\n\nH1\nIf God exists, there is no non-resistant, non-belief.\nH2\nThere is non-resistant, non-belief.\nH3\nTherefore, God does not exist.\n\n\n\nNon-resistant, non-belief refers to people who meet two conditions.\nFirst, they do not believe in God. Second, they are not resistant to\nbelief in God, where not being resistant may include both having the\nconceptual and emotional abilities to have a relationship with God as\nwell not having intentionally and culpably resisted such a\nrelationship. H1 can be defended in\nvarious ways, including: according to theism, being in a personal\nrelationship with God is the greatest good for people. However, the\nargument goes, such a personal relationship requires belief. Thus, if\nGod exists, and a person is not resistant to such a\nrelationship\u2014the person\u2019s greatest good\u2014then God\nwould \u201cmake his presence known\u201d to the person so they\nmight reasonably believe that God exists and enter into such a\nrelationship. In other words, God would not remain hidden from those\nwho are receptive to a relationship with God. But\nH2 claims there are such\npeople\u2014who are not resistant yet do not believe. Thus, there is\nno God.\n\nUnsurprisingly, some authors claim this argument for\nH1 is vulnerable to skeptical theistic\ncritique (see Bergmann 2009: 382, McBrayer and Swenson 2012). So far\nas we can tell, there is no reason that would justify God in remaining\nhidden to people who are receptive to a relationship with God. But\nfrom the mere fact that we cannot identify such a reason, it does not\nfollow that there is no such reason. Thus, attempts to\nestablish H1 by appealing to our knowledge\nof how God might plan to bring about certain goods\u2014like a loving\npersonal relation\u2014may be vulnerable to skeptical theistic\ncritique.\n8. Theory Development\n\nTheism is a cornerstone of many major religious traditions. But it is\nalso a metaphysical view, being an ontological claim about what\nexists. It is also one potential way of filling in a\n\u201csupernatural\u201d worldview on which the world is not\nexhausted by \u201cnatural\u201d things but also contains\n\u201csupernatural\u201d things. Many philosophers evaluate\nmetaphysical claims in a manner similar to scientific claims, such as\ntheir ability to explain phenomenon, be well-confirmed, exhibit\ntheoretical virtues (such as simplicity), etc.\n\nHowever, there is a well-known lesson in scientific theorizing about\nhow not to avoid a theoretical problem. Suppose we are\nevaluating a hypothesis H (say, Mars revolves around the\nEarth). But there is some data D that seems to strongly\ndisconfirm H (say, Mars exhibits \u201cretrograde\nmotion\u201d). One could expand or enrich\nH by adding further hypotheses to H that would predict the\ndata D (say, Mars orbits the earth using epicycles on an\norbit). The resulting expanded or enriched hypothesis may perfectly\nwell predict the data D. But if the resulting expanded or\nenriched hypothesis is random, unprincipled, independently\nimplausible, or otherwise ad hoc, it may not be plausible to\nbelieve the expanded hypothesis in virtue of these additions or\nexpansions. The lesson here\u2014crudely put\u2014is that one should\nnot respond to a problem for a hypothesis by just\nadding claims to that hypothesis. At the very least, one should also\nexplain why those additional claims are also expectable given the\nhypothesis in question. In that way, one can show that the additional\nclaims are not random, unprincipled, or ad hoc.\n\nAmong other things, theism is a metaphysical hypothesis. Many authors\nhave argued that various facts about good and evil are strong evidence\nthat disconfirms this hypothesis. In response, some authors have\nadduced skeptical theistic critiques, composed of further claims about\nGod and human limitations. However, the lesson from above is that\nsimply adding further claims is insufficient to defend a\nhypothesis from a theoretical problem. Thus, if these skeptical\ntheistic claims are random, ad hoc, or unprincipled when\nadded to theism, then even if the expanded theism adequately\nneutralizes the disconfirming evidence, the expanded theism may be too\nimplausible to be reasonably believed.\n\nThough not always framed in this way, skeptical theists have been\nsensitive to these points. Some skeptical theists argue that their\nskeptical theistic claims are independently plausible\u2014that is,\nplausible independent of whether or not theism is true. Other\nskeptical theists argue that their skeptical theistic claims are quite\nplausible given theism. Skeptical theists offer various\ndefenses, by appealing to considerations of human limitations or moral\nprogress or ruminations about historical complexity or analogies\ninvolving expertise in various fields (see, inter alia,\nAlston 1996: 317ff; Howard-Snyder 1996b: 301ff; Durston 2000; Bergmann\n2001: 284\u20136; Perrine 2019: 124\u2013126; Hendricks 2020).\nEither way, these arguments can be used to try to show that skeptical\ntheistic claims are not random, ad hoc, or unprincipled ways\nof \u201cexpanding\u201d or adding to theism.\n\nThe issue of how to develop a theory was incipient in some of the\nexchanges between Rowe and Wykstra (see Rowe 1986: 246\u20137; Rowe\n2006: 85ff; Wykstra 1984: 91ff; 1996: 142\u20135; Russell and Wykstra\n1988: 159\u2013160; Wykstra 1996: 140ff). For instance, Rowe concedes\nthat certain claims are entirely expectable given theism, such as:\nthere might be goods and evils beyond our ken but not beyond\nGod\u2019s. But other claims are not expectable given theism, such\nas: there is suffering that is necessary for goods beyond our ken\nand God would not tell us this. Rowe defends these claims by\nappeal to Wykstra\u2019s parent-child analogy. A parent may allow a\nchild to undergo a painful surgery for reasons that the child cannot\nyet understand; but a loving parent will surely not be absent\nwhile the child suffers (see also Dougherty 2012, Rutledge 2017b).\nWykstra argued that such claims are expectable given theism\nby means of his analogy with scientific depth. More recently, other\nauthors have tried to give other reasons why, even given theism, we\nshould expect seemingly unjustified suffering without divine\ncomfort or acknowledgement of that suffering (see DePoe 2014, 2017;\nShields 2021)). These disputes can be understood as disputes over\nwhether theism can be \u201cexpanded\u201d by skeptical theistic\nconsiderations in a way that is both plausible and undermines\narguments from evil, or whether the only plausible and principled ways\nof expanding theism do not undermine such arguments (compare Perrine\nand Wykstra 2014, 2017: 104\u20137).\n\nThe issue of theory development is important for two further reasons.\nFirst, many skeptical theists defend their claims and critiques by\narguing that critics misunderstand them or that their positions are\nanalogous to other cases that are perfectly unproblematic. However, as\nphilosophers of science like Kuhn and Lakatos have suggested, many of\nour best scientific theories offer recommendations (implicitly or\nexplicitly) for how to develop or expand hypotheses.\nSkeptical theists have spent less time making positive proposals for\nhow to develop or expand a theistic worldview. Unless they do so, some\ncritics may worry that skeptical theism makes theism into a\n\u201cdegenerating research program\u201d (to use Lakatos\u2019\ncharming phrase).\n\nSecond, many skeptical theists are not simply theists; they are\nadherents to some religious tradition. Religious traditions normally\nmake many more claims than (mere) theism, and religious traditions\nnormally reject other alternative religious traditions. Some\nphilosophers of religion\u2014such as Richard Swinburne\u2014have\ncontinued the project of natural theology to not only defend theism\nbut a specific religious tradition as well (Christianity, in\nSwinburne\u2019s case). But many\u2014including some skeptical\ntheists\u2014worry that such projects are undermined by skeptical\ntheistic considerations. If so, skeptical theists who are theists need\nto explore alternative routes for explaining the justification of\nreligious belief, such as reformed epistemology (see Plantinga and\nWolterstroff 1983; Plantinga 2000). At the very least, more work could\nbe done exploring positive models that incorporate justified belief in\nboth skeptical theism and specific religious traditions.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Additional Readings"], "cat_ref_text": {"Additional Readings": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Aikin, Scott and Brian Ribeiro, 2019. \u201cSkeptical Theism and\nthe Creep Problem,\u201d <em>Logos &amp; Episteme</em>, 10(4):\n349\u2013362.", "Bass, Robert, 2011. \u201cMany Inscrutable Evils,\u201d <em>Ars\nDisputandi</em>, 11: 118\u2013132.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2014. \u201cInscrutable Evils: Still\nNumerous, Still Relevant,\u201d <em>International Journal of\nPhilosophy and Theology</em>, 75(4): 379\u2013384.", "Buchak, Lara, 2014. \u201cLearning Not To be Na\u00efve: A\nComment on the Exchange Between Perrine/Wykstra and Draper,\u201d in\nDougherty and McBrayer (eds.) 2014, 178\u2013190.", "Draper, Paul, 2014a. \u201cConfirmation Theory and the Core of\nCORNEA,\u201d in Dougherty and McBrayer (eds.) 2014,\n132\u2013141.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2016. \u201cWhen Skeptical Theism Fails,\nSkeptical Atheism Prevails,\u201d In Jonathan Kvanvig, eds<em>,\nOxford Studies in Philosophy of Religion</em>, 7: 63\u201380", "Durston, Kirk, 2006. \u201cThe Complexity of History and Evil: A\nReply to Trakakis,\u201d <em>Religious Studies</em>, 42(1):\n87\u201399.", "Gilbertson, Eric, forthcoming. \u201cSkeptical Theism, the\nPreface Paradox, and Non-Cumulative Inductive Evidence of Pointless\nEvil,\u201d <em>Philosophia</em>.", "Hendricks, Perry, 2021. \u201cWe Are Not In the Dark,\u201d\n<em>American Philosophical Quarterly</em>, 58(2): 125\u201334.", "Howard-Snyder, Daniel and Michael Bergmann, 2020. \u201cEvil Does\nNot Make Atheism More Reasonable than Theism,\u201d in\n<em>Contemporary Debates in Philosophy of Religion</em>, Michael\nPeterson and Raymond Van Arragon (eds.), Malden, MA: Wiley-Blackwell,\n148\u2013159.", "Hudson, Hud, 2020. <em>A Grotesque in the Garden</em>, 2nd\nedition, Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans Press.", "Jordan, Jeff, 2017. \u201cThe \u201dLoving Parent\u201c\nAnalogy,\u201d <em>International Journal for Philosophy of\nReligion</em>, 82: 15\u201328.", "O\u2019Connor, David, 2013. \u201cTheistic Objections to\nSkeptical Theism,\u201d in McBrayer and Howard-Snyder (eds.) 2013,\n468\u2013481.", "Oliveira, Luis, 2021. \u201cSceptical Theism and the Paradox of\nEvil,\u201d <em>Australasian Journal of Philosophy</em>, 98(2):\n319\u2013333.", "Pegan, Philip, 2019. \u201cSharon Street\u2019s Unsuccessful\nArgument Against Theism<em>,\u201d International Journal for\nPhilosophy of Religion</em>, 86: 17\u201324.", "Rea, Michael, 2013. \u201cSkeptical Theism and the \u201dToo\nMuch Skepticism\u201c Objection,\u201d in McBrayer and Howard-Snyder\n(eds.) 2013, 482\u2013506.", "Russell, Bruce, 1996. \u201cDefenseless,\u201d in Howard-Snyder\n(ed.), 1996, 193\u2013205.", "Segal, Aaron, 2011. \u201cSceptical Theism and Divine\nTruths,\u201d <em>Religious Studies</em>, 47: 85\u201395.", "Snapper, Jef, 2011. \u201cPaying the Cost of Skeptical\nTheism<em>,\u201d International Journal for Philosophy of\nReligion</em>, 69: 45\u201356.", "Stone, Jim, 2003. \u201cEvidential Atheism,\u201d\n<em>Philosophical Studies</em>, 114: 253\u2013277.", "Timpe, Kevin, 2014. \u201cTrust, Silence, and Liturgical\nActs,\u201d in Dougherty and McBrayer (eds.) 2014,\n264\u2013275.", "Trakakis, Nick, 2003. \u201cEvil and the Complexity of History: A\nResponse to Durston,\u201d <em>Religious Studies</em>, 39:\n451\u2013458.", "Wielenberg, Erik, 2014. \u201cDivine Deception,\u201d in\nDougherty and McBrayer (eds.) 2014, 236\u2013249.", "Wykstra, Stephen J, 2017. \u201cBeyond the Impasse: Contemporary\nMoral Theory and the Crisis of Skeptical Theism,\u201d in <em>Ethics\nand the Problem of Evil</em>, James Sterba (ed.), Bloomington: Indiana\nUniversity Press, 108\u2013140.\n</ul>\n</div>"]}, "raw_text": "<div id=\"bibliography\">\n<h2 id=\"Bib\">Bibliography</h2>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">\n<li>Adams, Marilyn McCord, 2013. \u201cIgnorance, Instrumentality,\nCompensation, and the Problem of Evil,\u201d <em>Sophia</em>, 52:\n7\u201326.</li>\n<li>Almeida, M.
