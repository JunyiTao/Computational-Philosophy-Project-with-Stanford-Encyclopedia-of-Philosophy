    "main_text": "Objections to Neutral Monism || The Problem of Experience\n4.4 The Problem of Experience\n\nEven if materialist suspicions about it are misplaced, some critics\nhold that neutral monism shares a common failing with materialism:\nnamely, that it cannot accommodate experience. The argument is driven\nby two deep metaphysical convictions. First, experience cannot be\nreduced to or constructed from the non-experiential; second, radical\nemergence is unintelligible. Assuming that the neutral must be\nnon-experiential, it follows that the neutral monist world has no room\nfor experience. Galen Strawson has wielded this argument against all\nforms of traditional materialism, and occasionally also against\nneutral monism (Strawson 1994, 2016, 2020).\n\nDavid Chalmers has raised a related worry about neutral monism,\nespecially in its panqualityist forms (see section 5.5 below): He\nargues that there is no path that leads from the qualities we\nexperience (but which are not experiential themselves) to the\nexperience of those qualities. Having an experience is a matter of\nhaving phenomenal qualities. Phenomenal qualities involve awareness of\nqualities. But \u201cno instantiations of qualities ever necessitate\nawareness of qualities\u201d (Chalmers 2015: 273). This\n\u201cquality/awareness gap\u201d (Chalmers 2015: 273) shows that no\nstructure of qualities can add up to\n experience.[19]\n\nThe traditional neutral monists would all agree that the mere\ninstantiation of qualities (which are intrinsically neutral) does not\nnecessitate any awareness of qualities. After all, such awareness\nresults only when a number of such qualities are appropriately related\nto each other. However, they depart from Chalmers in holding that\nsuitable relations among qualities are not only necessary for\nawareness, they are also sufficient for it. That is, for a subject\n(understood as an organized bundle of neutral events) to be aware of,\nsay, a red patch, just is for the red patch to bear the right kinds of\ncomplex causal-functional relations to other neutral events in an\norganized system of which it is a member (i.e. the bundle-self). Thus,\nthe traditional neutral monists would reject the view that no\nstructure of qualities can add up to experience.\n\nWhether such a reply is satisfactory is a matter of ongoing debate.\nYet to the extent that this proposal succeeds, it does raise a further\nquestion suggested by Strawson\u2019s argument above: is experience,\nthus understood in a neutral monist setting, a feature that is\nemergent in an objectionable way?\n",
