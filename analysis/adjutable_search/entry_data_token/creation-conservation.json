The major monotheisms unambiguously affirm that God both created\nthe world and conserves it. It is less clear, however, whether\ncreation and conservation are to be conceived as distinct kinds of\nactions. The question has its roots in medieval and early modern\ncharacterizations of divine action, and it has received renewed\nattention in recent decades.\n\nOn the predominant traditional view, conservation is continuous\ncreation. Adherents of this view typically say with Francisco\nSu\u00e1rez that God\u2019s creation and conservation of things are\n\u201conly conceptually distinct\u201d (Su\u00e1rez 1597, 120).\nJonathan Edwards, for example, says, \u201cGod\u2019s upholding\ncreated substance, or causing its existence in each successive moment,\nis altogether equivalent to an immediate production out of nothing, at\neach moment\u2026. So that this effect differs not at all from the\nfirst creation, but only circumstantially\u2026\u201d (Edwards\n1758, 402). In other words, there is no real difference between the\nact of creation and the act of conservation, though different words\nmay be used for them. Descartes, Malebranche, Leibniz, and Berkeley\nall express similar views. More recently, Philip Quinn likewise treats\nboth God\u2019s creating and God\u2019s conserving as species of\nbringing about a thing\u2019s existence. We call the act\n\u2018creation\u2019 if it occurs at the first time at which the\ncreature exists, and we call it \u2018conservation\u2019 if it\noccurs at a later time, but the action is the same (e.g., Quinn 1988,\n54).\n\nThe alternative to this view is that the act of conserving beings that\nalready exist differs from calling beings into existence from nothing.\nSome argue that each persisting creature plays a causal role in its\nongoing existence, so that God is not the sole agent as in an ex\nnihilo creation. Some also argue that conservation must be an\nongoing act, whereas creation occurs at an instant.\n\nA large part of what is at stake in the debate is the relationship\nbetween divine action and creaturely action. Continuous creation\ntheorists may reject a distinction between creation and conservation\nas an attempt to attribute a divine prerogative to created things. On\nthe other hand, those who endorse a distinction may regard continuous\ncreation theory as (to borrow a phrase) \u201cone of those\nhigh-minded philosophical depreciations of God\u2019s works that come\ndisguised as compliments to God\u2019s person\u201d (van Inwagen\n1988, 46 n4). The debate also raises a number of interesting questions\nabout causation, time, and their relations.\n", "toc": [{"#DisTheDivCon": "1.

Distinguishing Theses about Divine Conservation\n\nIt will be useful to distinguish between several theses.\n\nThe conservation thesis: The continued existence of created things\ndepends on God\u2019s activity.\nThe same-action thesis: God\u2019s action of creating things is\nthe same action as God\u2019s conserving things.\nThe sole-source thesis: God alone brings about the continued\nexistence of created things.\nOccasionalism: God is the only genuine cause of any effect.\n\n\nThe conservation thesis is inconsistent with the Deistic understanding\nof God\u2019s relationship to the world, on which the world\u2019s\nexistence and operation require no divine involvement after the world\nis brought into being. In a different way, the conservation thesis is\ninconsistent with any view that denies that created things truly\npersist through time. If no created thing exists for more than an\ninstant, God may well be continuously creating, but God is not\nconserving what has been created. Within traditional Jewish,\nChristian, and Muslim theology the conservation thesis is relatively\nuncontroversial, in part because the thesis is apparently implied by\nthe sacred texts. (One biblical example is Hebrews 1:3: \u201c[The\nSon] is the reflection of God\u2019s glory and the exact imprint of\nGod\u2019s very being, and he sustains all things by his powerful\nword.\u201d One quranic example is Al-Baqarah 2:255: \u201cHis\neternal power overspreads the heavens and the earth, and their\nupholding wearies Him not.\u201d For a challenge to the conservation\nthesis, see Beaudoin 2007.)\n\nOne who affirms that conservation is a continuation of creation goes\nbeyond the mere affirmation of conservation to a theory about the\nnature of conservation. Such a person might have either the\nsame-action thesis or the sole-source thesis in mind. The same-action\nthesis implies that conservation is continued (or\n\u201ccontinuous\u201d) creation in the sense that the ongoing\nexistence of created things through time is an effect of the very\naction that caused them to exist in the first place. The action itself\nmay well be timeless, so it is the effect that is really\ncontinued.\n\nThe sole-source thesis implies that conservation is continued creation\nin the sense that God conserves in just the way that God creates,\ni.e., without the aid of created things, either as causal co-agents or\nas patients. Like creation, conservation is an ex nihilo act.\nThe view Edwards expresses above is a representative example of this\nclaim.\n\nBoth the same-action thesis and the sole-source thesis have a\nprominent role in the historical discussion of conservation, but they\nare distinct claims. Typically \u2018continuous creation\ntheory\u2019 names the sole-source thesis, which has come to be the\nsalient idea, but the language of continuous creation has also\nsometimes referred to the same-action thesis (e.g., see the\n\u2018continuata creatio\u2019 entry in Muller 1985).\n\nYet another thesis is occasionalism, which says that God is not only\nthe sole cause of the ongoing existence of created things but also of\nevery other event that they may be involved in, including those in\nwhich created things may appear to affect others. Some have objected\nto continuous creation theory on the grounds that it implies\noccasionalism. (See section 3.1.)\n2. Arguments for Conservation as Continuous Creation\n2.1 From Divine Atemporality\n\nBecause of the ambiguity noted above, both defenders and deniers of\ncontinuous creation can find some inspiration in the thought of Thomas\nAquinas. In Summa Theologiae he says,\n\nThe preservation of things by God is a continuation of that action by\nwhich He gives existence, which action is without either motion or\ntime; so also the light in the air is by the continual influence of\nthe sun. (Ia.104.1, reply to obj. 4)\n\n\nHere the doctrine of divine atemporality supports the same-action\nthesis. By one unchanging action God brings about the existence of\ncreatures (i.e., created things) at whatever times they exist.\n(Malebranche echoes this view in, e.g., Dialogues on\nMetaphysics, VII.7.)\n\nIn the article that follows, however, Aquinas argues explicitly that\nthis does not imply that God preserves created things immediately\n(i.e., without an intermediate cause). Some creatures depend on other\ncreatures for their preservation, as well as on God as their principle\ncause (Ia.104.2). Aquinas\u2019s claim implies that the preservation\nof created things differs from their creation, and that the\nsole-source thesis is false.\n\nContemporary philosophers Jonathan Kvanvig and Hugh McCann argue for\ncontinuous creation theory on the basis of divine immutability. They\ndefend their case against replies of two sorts: (1) attempts to limit\nthe object of divine creation so as to exclude the continuing\nexistence of creatures (while granting divine immutability), and (2)\nobjections to divine immutability. As Kvanvig and McCann acknowledge,\nthe notion of divine immutability faces a non-trivial challenge from\nthe argument that an omniscient being must know what time it is, and\nmust therefore change (see Kretzmann 1966). For this reason they\nsuggest bolstering the case for continuous creation theory with\nadditional arguments.\n2.2 From the Superfluity of a Distinction\n\nFrancisco Su\u00e1rez endorses the same-action thesis, attributing\nthe view to Aquinas and others. For Su\u00e1rez, creation and\nconservation are the same act and do not differ \u201cexcept merely\nconceptually or because of some connotation and relation\u201d\n(Su\u00e1rez 1597, 121). He concludes that conservation has no\npatient; God does not do something to an already existing creature to\npreserve it. Rather, its preservation is an instance of creation\nex nihilo. So Su\u00e1rez\u2019s position includes the\nsole-source thesis as well.\n\nSu\u00e1rez supports his position by arguing that any distinction\nbetween creation and conservation would be superfluous. He argues, for\nexample, that if creation and conservation were two distinct actions,\nthen the second would have to last for the whole time the creature was\nconserved. But if so, the first action could last for that time\nequally well, and there would be no point in positing two actions.\n\nSu\u00e1rez also emphasizes that the effect of creation and\nconservation is the same: the existence of the creature.\n\n\u2026 an action has its unity from its terminus and its\nprinciple\u2014or from its patient as well, if it is an action on a\npatient. But the production and the conservation have exactly the same\nterminus; therefore, if the principle is the same, as we are\npresupposing, then the action we are discussing here will be the same,\nsince creation has no subject [i.e., no patient] (ibid.,\n122).\n\n\nThe arguments of Aquinas, Su\u00e1rez, and others were influential\nenough that Descartes could later describe the same-action thesis as\n\u201can opinion commonly accepted among theologians\u201d\n(Discourse on the Method, Part Five, 133).\n2.3 From the Inability of Created Things to Sustain Their Own Existence \n\nA number of thinkers have argued for the sole-source thesis not (or\nnot only) on the basis of the nature of divine action, but on the\nbasis of creatures\u2019 inability to preserve themselves. In\nPrinciples of Philosophy, Descartes argued for God\u2019s\nexistence from the persistence of objects through time. His reasoning\nmakes it clear that he regarded conservation as a continual\nre-creation.\n\nIt will be impossible for anything to obscure the clarity of this\nproof, if we attend to the nature of time or of the duration of\nthings. For the nature of time is such that its parts are not mutually\ndependent, and never coexist. Thus, from the fact that we now exist,\nit does not follow that we shall exist a moment from now, unless there\nis some cause\u2014the same cause which originally produced\nus\u2014which continually reproduces us, as it were, that is to say,\nwhich keeps us in existence. For we easily understand that there is no\npower in us enabling us to keep ourselves in existence. We also\nunderstand that he who has so great a power that he can keep us in\nexistence, although we are distinct from him, must be all the more\nable to keep himself in existence; or rather, he requires no other\nbeing to keep him in existence, and hence, in short, is God\n(Principles of Philosophy, 200).\n\n\nIf created things were able to contribute causally to their ongoing\nexistence, then God would cooperate with the creatures in conserving\nthem. This would make creation and conservation distinct on the\nassumption that the creatures\u2019 causal contributions are not\nredundant. But Descartes claims that, given the nature of time,\ncreatures have no power to conserve themselves, and that God\nalone causes their continued existence.\n\nJonathan Edwards, a zealous defender of divine majesty and\nsovereignty, gives a similar argument for creatures\u2019 dependence\non God for their present existence.\n\n[The cause of the present existence of a created substance]\ncan\u2019t be the antecedent existence of the same substance. For\ninstance, the existence of the body of the moon at this present\nmoment, can\u2019t be the effect of its existence at the last\nforegoing moment. For not only was what existed the last moment, no\nactive cause, but wholly a passive thing; but this also is to be\nconsidered, that no cause can produce effects in a time and\nplace on which itself is not. \u2018Tis plain,\nnothing can exert itself, or operate, when and where it is not\nexisting. But the moon\u2019s past existence was neither\nwhere nor when its present existence is. (1758, 400)\n\n\nLater Edwards adds that the same reasoning shows that no part of the\neffect is due to the antecedent existence of the substance in question\n(ibid., 402). He concludes, \u201cGod\u2019s\npreserving created things in being is perfectly equivalent to\na continued creation, or to his creating those things out of\nnothing at each moment of their existence\u201d\n(ibid., 401).\n\nWhile Descartes\u2019s argument, as stated, assumes that created\nthings persist through time, Edwards comes close to claiming that\ncreated things do not persist at all. Given continuous creation\ntheory, he says, \u201cthere is no such thing as any identity or\noneness in created objects, existing at different times, but what\ndepends on God\u2019s sovereign constitution\u201d\n(ibid., 404). However, he qualifies this with the claims that\nthere are different kinds of identity and oneness, and that\nGod\u2019s constitution\u2014that is, God\u2019s decree or\nordaining\u2014is what makes truths of this sort.\n\nEdwards\u2019s view has two disadvantages with respect to the case\nfor continuous creation theory. One is that the argument implies that\ncreated things are not genuine causes, a position explicitly rejected\nby most thinkers in the tradition (a matter to which we will return\nbelow). The other is that, because creatures arguably do not persist\non this view, it is inaccurate to say that they are conserved. God\ndoes indeed continuously create, but the objects so created are new\nobjects. So understood, the view implies that nothing is conserved,\nproperly speaking.\n\nEdwards regarded creatures\u2019 inability to sustain themselves as\n\u201cplain.\u201d Kvanvig and McCann attempt to bolster this\nposition by undermining several potential reasons for thinking the\ncontrary. For example, one might think that the diachronic character\nof physical laws shows that physical objects have an innate ability to\npersist. If they did not, what would make the laws reliable predictors\nof objects\u2019 behavior? Kvanvig and McCann find this thought\nlacking on the grounds that physical laws presuppose the continuing\nexistence of the world. They are reliable because the presupposition\nis correct, but not because the objects they characterize are\nself-sustaining.\n\nIs the idea of an innate self-sustaining quality tenable? Kvanvig and\nMcCann consider a number of possible construals and argue that they\nare of dubious coherence. They also give an argument with an\nEdwardsian flavor. A power to perpetuate one\u2019s own existence\nwould be an ability to cause something to occur at a future time, a\ntime at which the exercise of the power would no longer exist. No\nphysical sequence of events could be the basis for such a time-jumping\npower, since such a sequence would itself depend on a power of this\nsort. So the power would need to bring about a future effect without\nthe aid of any intervening events to connect them. But nothing that no\nlonger exists can be causally operative, so there can be no such power\n(Kvanvig and McCann 1988, 42\u20133).\n3. Arguments for a distinction between creation and conservation \n3.1 From secondary causation \n\n(See also\n Occasionalism.)\n\nOne persistent worry about the sole-source thesis has its roots in the\nmedieval debate over whether there is secondary causation (i.e.,\ngenuine causation by created things). Suppose that created things are\ncauses: fire really does cause water to boil, and ice really does\ncause it to cool. If creatures can affect future events in this way,\nwhy should they not at least help to bring about their own future\nexistence? Why should their causal powers be limited to affecting the\nqualities of things without contributing to their own presence in the\nworld? Contrapositively, if created things cannot bring about their\nown future existence, are they also unable to have any effect on the\nfuture?\n\nOccasionalism is the theory that there is no genuine secondary\ncausation, since God is not only the first cause but the only cause.\nWe might be tempted to regard a fire beneath a pot of water as a\ncreated cause, but its presence is merely an occasion for God to cause\nthe water to boil. The worry about the sole-source thesis, then, is\nthat it implies occasionalism. William Lane Craig, for example, says\nthat continuous creation theory \u201cruns the risk of falling into\nthe radical occasionalism of certain medieval Islamic theologians\n\u2026\u201d (Craig 1998, \n183).[1] \nThe Ash\u2019arites, for example, believed on\nscriptural grounds that only God has agency (McGinnis 2006). They\noffered a variety of arguments for occasionalism and against\nAvicenna\u2019s position that created objects have natures as\nAristotle conceived of them and thus have causal powers\nessentially. \n\nNonetheless, occasionalism has been a minority view among theists.\nAquinas and Su\u00e1rez both hold that conservation is in some sense\ncontinued creation but reject occasionalism in very strong terms. This\nis a typical position among theists, for most of whom the proposition\nthat continuous creation theory implies occasionalism would constitute\nan objection to the former.\n\nIt is easy to produce arguments for continuous creation theory that\nalso support occasionalism. In particular, the arguments that are\ndriven by the inability of created things to affect the future (such\nas those by Descartes and Edwards, above, and similar arguments by\nMalebranche) appear to have occasionalism as a corollary. If no cause\ncan have an effect at a time at which it does not exist, then created\nthings do not bring about their future states, nor those of other\ncreated things. The changes in the world can only be caused by God.\nMalebranche and Edwards would have happily accepted this result;\nDescartes\u2019 case is less clear. In contrast, Kvanvig and McCann\n(1988, 43\u201344) deny that their similar argument implies\noccasionalism.\n\nApart from any particular argument for continuous creation theory,\nPhilip Quinn argues that the view itself does not imply occasionalism\n(Quinn 1988). Whether causal relations are understood as Humean\nregularities, Lewisian counterfactual dependences, or necessary\nconnections, the proposition that God is the sole cause of the\nexistence of contingent beings does not entail that God is the only\ncause of events. It remains possible that contingent beings\nnonetheless have causal influence over the qualities and behavior of\nother such beings. The result is a cooperative picture of the evolving\nstate of the world. \u201cGod and the lit match collaborate to\nproduce the heated water: God provides the water, and the lit match\nprovides the heat\u201d (Quinn 1988, 70).\n\nAndrew Pavelich poses what we may call the first-moment objection to\nsuch a view. If we consider the moment at which God creates a universe\nof objects in motion, it seems that the causal powers of the created\nobjects could not account for the character of other objects,\nincluding their motion. At the first moment, only God\u2019s creative\npower could affect their state. But if each later time is one at which\nGod creates the world ex nihilo, then each time is relevantly\nsimilar to the first. At no time will a created thing be able to\nexercise its causal powers (Pavelich 2007, 12\u201313).\n\nOne possible reply (discussed by Pavelich) grants that a thing created\nat time t has no effect on other things at t, but\nnonetheless affects things at later times (whether the things affected\nare identical to things that existed at t or distinct from\nthem). Later times differ from the first at least in that they are\npreceded by earlier times, and this opens up the possibility that\nthings existing at later times are affected by causal powers exercised\nearlier. Such a reply is not available to one who, like Jonathan\nEdwards, assumes that no object can have an effect at a place or time\nat which it is not. However, for those who affirm causal relations\nacross time, a position that includes continuous creation but rejects\noccasionalism is a theoretical option.\n3.2 From the persistence of created things \n\nOne reason for thinking that the persistence of created objects must\ndepend on some exercise of those objects\u2019 causal powers, and not\nGod\u2019s creative power alone, is that an object that did not\ndepend on its earlier existence could not really be the same object.\nTo persist, an object\u2019s later existence must be due (at least in\npart) to its own earlier existence. Persistence, in turn, is a\nnecessary condition of conservation, since a world without persistent\nobjects would not be conserved in being but rather succeeded in\nbeing.\n\nWe have already noted (in section 2.3) that Edwards\u2019s case for\ncontinuous creation comes close to denying that created things do,\nstrictly, persist through time. One might well wonder, then, whether\nthe sole-source thesis precludes creatures\u2019 identity over time.\nThe intuition that persistence requires causal dependence (at the\nleast) is widely shared. Peter van Inwagen, for example, accepts it as\na constraint on acceptable answers to the question of how physical\npersons could persist between death and resurrection. In that context\nhe writes:\n\nIn the end, there would seem to be no way round the following\nrequirement: if I am a material thing, then, if a man who lives at\nsome time in the future is to be I, there will have to be some sort of\nmaterial and causal continuity between this matter that composes me\nnow and the matter that will then compose that man. (van Inwagen 1995,\n486)\n\n\nMost physicalists who have since addressed this puzzle have shared van\nInwagen\u2019s assumption despite the fact that denying the causal\nrequirement would make it much easier to provide a solution. This\nsuggests that the causal requirement has considerable intuitive\nforce.\n\nThe sole-source thesis may even threaten the persistence of creatures\napart from the causal requirement. Craig articulates the question\nwhether the lack of a patient in conservation has this result.\n\nIs it even coherent to affirm that God creates a persistent entity\nanew at every instant? If at every t God created ex nihilo,\nis it really x which exists at successive instants rather than a\nseries of simulacra? Since there is no patient subject on which the\nagent acts in creation, how is it that it is the identical subject\nwhich is re-created each instant out of nothing rather than a\nnumerically distinct, but similar, subject? (Craig 1998, 184)\n\n\nOne way to defend continuous creation theory from the persistence\nobjection is to argue that it is possible to create the same object\nmore than once. Quinn distinguishes between creating something\n(bringing about its existence) and introducing something (bringing\nabout its existence for the first time). It is clearly impossible to\nintroduce something at more than one time, but, Quinn argues, it is\nnot at all clear that it is impossible to create something at more\nthan one time. Quinn thus calls the causal requirement into question\n(Quinn\n 1983).[2]\n\nTemporal parts theory may suggest another line of defense. William\nVallicella says briefly that an occasionalist can affirm the\npersistence of created things by holding that time is continuous and\nthat persisting objects are composed of continuum-many temporal parts\n(Vallicella 1996, 353 n. 20). If this is correct, then a continuous\ncreation theorist can presumably do the same. David Vander Laan\nconsiders a temporal-parts strategy and finds it problematic. Given a\nsufficiently inclusive theory of composition, he argues, a series of\nobjects may indeed compose an object that exists at various times and\nthereby persists, but if there are no causal relations between these\nobjects it does not seem that their sum could be, e.g., a human\nperson. Arbitrary cross-temporal sums need not be united by internal\ncausal relations, but persons must (Vander Laan 2006, 164).\n\nVander Laan explores the range of options for resolving the tension\nbetween continuous creation theory and the causal requirement. The\ncontinuous creation theorist should explain what, if not causal\ncontinuity, could distinguish a case of persistence from a case of\nreplacement by qualitative duplicates. Of the options he considers,\nVander Laan suggests that the most viable one locates the difference\nin a divine fiat that is present in the persistence case and absent in\nthe replacement case (2006, 165\u20136). On the other hand, one who\naffirms the causal requirement should explain in what sense God\nsustains things in existence. Vander Laan identifies two\npossibilities: (1) a joint-sufficiency theory on which God\u2019s\ncausal contribution and the creature\u2019s causal contribution are\nboth needed for the creature\u2019s persistence, and (2) a\nco-operative divine sufficiency theory on which God\u2019s act must\ncause the creature to bring about its continued existence (2006,\n172\u20134).\n3.3 From the nature of time \n\nOne recent objection to continuous creation theory maintains that it\nimplies that time is not real (Pavelich 2007, 16\u201319). Pavelich\nargues that for time to be real, it must have a kind of\n\u201ctemporal inertia,\u201d a natural tendency to move from each\nmoment to succeeding moments. This inertia would include a natural\ntendency of things existing at times to continue existing. But it is\nthis very sort of inertia that continuous creation theory denies,\nsince it says that the existence of times and objects in time depend\nsolely on divine acts.\n\nPavelich suggests that the tension between time and continuous\ncreation runs even deeper. Given continuous creation theory, times\nonly stand in relations of before and after because of God\u2019s\ncreative activity. But then we cannot say that God creates one moment\nbefore or after another, as temporal relations hold only subsequent to\nthose acts of creation.\n\nOne possible response to these claims is that time can be real without\n\u201ctemporal inertia.\u201d Some will reject the intuition that\ntime must move or pass due to its own natural disposition. Some reject\nthe passage of time entirely. Others will say that temporal passage is\nreal and that it occurs precisely because of God\u2019s creative\nactivity. (Recall the argument of Descartes quoted in section\n2.3.)\n\nAnother possible response is that there is a creation-independent time\nin which God operates that could confer reality on the time of the\ncreated world. Pavelich contends that even if such a time were real,\nit would not succeed in conferring reality on the time of the created\nworld. The moments of the created world would still not be directly\nrelated to each other so as to make time real. God could even create\nthem out of sequence or change the past, Pavelich argues, without\ncausing anything odd that a created being could notice.\n3.4 From differences in the causal patient and the time of occurrence \n\nAccording to Craig, it is intuitively clear that creation and\nconservation are distinct actions since conservation has a patient (or\nobject) and creation does not. To conserve a thing in being is to act\non that thing. In contrast, to create a thing is not to act\non it or on any other thing, but to bring it into existence from\nnothing. Thus the \u201ccircumstantial\u201d distinction between\ncreation and conservation (i.e., causing the existence of something\nthat did not exist earlier vs. causing the existence of something that\ndid exist earlier) requires a deeper distinction between the natures\nof the actions themselves (Craig 1998, 183). We may call this an\nagent-patient theory of conservation (Miller 2009). Craig finds this\nintuitive distinction expressed in Scotus, though Timothy Miller\ndisputes this interpretation (2009, 475).\n\nThis difference between creation and conservation also makes it clear,\nCraig argues, that the two occur at different times. Creation is\ninstantaneous; it occurs at the moment that the created thing first\nexists. Though the creation of a thing is generally preceded by the\nthing\u2019s nonexistence, the act itself is not an extended process\nof moving something from nonexistence to existence. Until it exists\nthe thing is not there to be acted upon. But conservation is the act\nof preserving a thing in existence from one time to another, so it\nmust occur over an interval of time (Craig 1998, 186\u20137). In\nother words, creation is synchronic, but conservation is diachronic.\nIn several ways, then, reflection on the very notions of creation and\nconservation lead us to see that the two are to be distinguished.\n\nThe agent-patient theory has elicited two objections related to the\ntime at which conservation occurs. Vallicella argues that on this view\nGod cannot begin conserving an object (Vallicella 2002) and Miller\nargues that on this view God cannot conserve things continuously\n(2009, 478\u2013483).\n\nVallicella observes first that if conservation has a patient,\nGod\u2019s conservation of it must be diachronic. If the act of\nconservation were simultaneous with the effect of the object\u2019s\nexistence, then God\u2019s act at a time would both cause and\npresuppose the existence of that object at that time. So the act must\noccur at an earlier time or over an earlier interval. Next Vallicella\nargues that if God creates an object ex nihilo at t,\nGod cannot conserve it at t since it does not yet exist.\nClearly God cannot begin to conserve an object at a time after it is\ncreated, since the object would only exist at that time if it had\nalready been conserved. So there is no time at which God can begin to\nconserve an object. Miller responds by wondering why the object would\nnot exist at t. Vallicella\u2019s distinction between the\ntime of an object\u2019s coming into existence and the first time at\nwhich it exists is dubious, since a nonexistent object could not\nundergo a process of coming into existence (Miller 2009, 477).\n\nMiller\u2019s own objection to the agent-patient theory is that it\ndoes not allow God to conserve continuously (2009, 478\u2013483).\nThough conservation is in general diachronic on the agent-patient\ntheory, God\u2019s initial act of conservation must occur at the\nmoment the patient first exists. This act either brings about the\nexistence of the patient at a later moment or through a later\ninterval. If at a later moment, then the patient will not exist at the\ntimes between its creation and the moment in question. If through a\nlater\n interval,[3]\n then during that interval God would not need to conserve the patient,\nsince its existence over that interval then would have already been\nsecured by God\u2019s conserving act at its first moment. Any\nconserving act during the interval would be redundant. Beyond the\ninterval the dilemma arises again, suggesting that conservation on the\nagent-patient theory would need to be discontinuous, something like a\nperson pushing a merry-go-round every few seconds to keep it\nspinning.\n\nOne further problem of the agent-patient theory, Miller adds, is that\nif the act of conservation can bring about the existence of a thing\nover an interval, then there seems to be no reason that any sustaining\nact is needed after the moment of its creation. The interval of\nexistence caused at its first moment could be long enough to include\nthe object\u2019s entire span of existence. So conservation over time\nappears to be unnecessary. Vander Laan (2022) explores\nwhether Miller\u2019s objection to the agent-patient theory can be\ncircumvented by theories on which God\u2019s conserving\naction brings about the later existence of the patient only in\nconjunction with additional, continuous divine activity.\n\nThe arguments surveyed above illustrate how both the historical\ndiscussion and the contemporary debate about creation and conservation\nare multifaceted. Considerations regarding divine nature, human\nnature, causation, and time are all relevant to whether conservation\nshould be understood as continuous creation. A key task of those who\nwish to stake out a position in the debate, then, is to assess which\nof these varied arguments are most powerful and which can be met by\ncredible objections.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Aquinas, Thomas, 1274. <em>Summa Theologiae</em>, Fathers of the\nEnglish Dominican Province (tr.), second revised edition,\n <a href=\"https://www.newadvent.org/summa/\" target=\"other\">available online</a>.", "Beaudoin, John, 2007. \u201cThe World\u2019s Continuance: Divine\nConservation or Existential Inertia?\u201d <em>International Journal\nfor Philosophy of Religion</em>, 61: 83\u201398.", "Craig, William Lane, 1998. \u201cCreation and Conservation Once\nMore,\u201d <em>Religious Studies</em>, 34: 177\u201388.", "Descartes, Rene, 1637. <em>Discourse on the Method</em>, in\n<em>The Philosophical Writings of Descartes</em>, John Cottingham,\nRobert Stoothoff, and Dugald Murdoch (eds.), Cambridge: Cambridge\nUniversity Press, 1985, pp. 111\u201351.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1644. <em>Principles of Philosophy</em>, in\n<em>The Philosophical Writings of Descartes</em>, John Cottingham,\nRobert Stoothoff, and Dugald Murdoch (eds.), Cambridge: Cambridge\nUniversity Press, 1985, pp. 177\u2013291.", "Edwards, Jonathan, 1758. <em>Original Sin</em>, in <em>The Works\nof Jonathan Edwards</em> (Volume 3), Clyde Holbrook (ed.), New Haven:\nYale University Press, 1970.", "Fakhry, Majid, 1958. <em>Islamic Occasionalism and it Critique by\nAverroes and Aquinas</em>, London: George Allen &amp; Unwin.", "Freddoso, Alfred, 1988. \u201cMedieval Aristotelianism and the\nCase against Secondary Causation in Nature,\u201d in Thomas V.
