    "main_text": "Content Externalism || Arguments for Content Externalism\n3.1 Arguments for Content Externalism\n\nContent externalism is most commonly associated with two vivid thought\nexperiments, presented in the 1970s; the first by Hilary Putnam\n(1975), and the second by Tyler Burge (1979).\nPutnam\u2019s Twin Earth Thought Experiment\n\nImagine a planet, a twin earth. There are a few things you\nshould know about this planet. First, it duplicates earth in almost\nevery respect. On twin earth, at this very moment, a twin version of\nyou is reading a twin version of this Stanford Encyclopedia\nentry, which has been written by a twin version of me. The twin\nversion of you is your exact, molecule-for-molecule, duplicate.\nSecond, the only difference between earth and twin earth is this: on\ntwin earth, the substance that sits in oceans, flows in rivers, and\ncomes out of faucets is not water. It is not water, because it is not\nmade up of two parts of hydrogen to one part of oxygen. In fact, it is\nnot made of hydrogen and oxygen at all but, rather, some other\nelements entirely absent on our earth. Nevertheless, third, this\nsubstance looks, tastes, and feels exactly like water does to people\non our earth, and is used in the same way. Finally, this thought\nexperiment is set in 1750 (and, a corresponding twin 1750), before\npeople had any idea of the underlying molecular structure of\nsubstances such as water.\n\nSuppose you say, or write, the sentence, \u201cWater is wet\u201d.\nYour twin produces a sentence with the same phonetic or syntactic\nform: \u201cWater is wet\u201d. Do the two sentence-tokens have the\nsame meaning? Putnam\u2019s answer is that they do not. This answer\nwill be found inviting by anyone who thinks of meaning as a matter of\nreference, or truth-makers, or\ntruth-conditions, or, in short, anyone who thinks that the\nmeaning of a term or sentence is, at least in part, a matter of its\nrelation to some kind of worldly correlate. The reference of\nthe syntactic/phonetic form \u201cwater\u201d differs between you\nand your twin. When you utter the sentence, you are making a report\nabout water\u2014a substance composed of hydrogen and oxygen. But\nyour twin\u2019s corresponding report is about the substance on twin\nearth. For purposes of identification, we can call this substance\ntwater, but the twin earthlings, of course, call it no such\nthing. They speak twin-English, and so refer to this substance with\nthe syntactic/phonetic form \u201cwater\u201d. Moreover, your\nutterance and your twin\u2019s utterance are both true, but different\nfacts make them true. Your utterance is made true by a fact\nabout water, whereas your twin\u2019s utterance is made true by a\nfact about twater. The truth-conditions of the utterances\nalso differ. For your utterance to be true, water must be wet. For\nyour twin\u2019s utterances to be true, twater must be wet. Thus,\nfrom the perspective of theories that think of meaning in terms of\nthese kinds of worldly correlates\u2014reference, truth-makers,\ntruth-conditions\u2014there are good reasons for endorsing\nPutnam\u2019s conclusion.\n\nAs McGinn (1977), and Burge (1979), have pointed out, this claim can\nbe extended to the content of propositional attitudes. In ascribing a\npropositional attitude\u2014such as a thought, belief,\ndesire\u2014to a person, we use a \u201cthat\u201d-construction,\nfollowed by an embedded sentence. The sentence is commonly thought to\nexpress the content of the propositional attitude: that is, the\nmeaning of the sentence is identical with the content of the\npropositional attitude. Therefore, if the sentences expressed by you\nand your twin have different meanings, it is difficult to avoid the\nconclusion that the contents of your thoughts, beliefs and desires\nalso vary. However, beliefs, and other propositional attitudes are\nindividuated by their contents. The belief that grass is green is a\ndifferent belief from the belief that snow is white because their\ncontents are different. Therefore, if the contents of the beliefs had\nby you and your twin are different, then so too are your beliefs.\n\nDespite its seemingly outlandish nature, this twin earth thought\nexperiment is just a way of making graphic a simple point. You and\nyour twin are, as a matter of stipulation, molecule-for-molecule\nduplicates. Thus, everything situated inside your head (and biological\nboundaries more generally) is, by stipulation, qualitatively (if not\nnumerically) identical. Nevertheless, your beliefs (and other\npropositional attitudes) differ. The principle that emerges is, then,\nthis: if you fix what is going inside the head (and biological\nboundaries more generally) of an individual and vary his or her\nenvironment, some of that individual\u2019s mental states will vary\nwith variations in the environment even though everything in his or\nher head remains the same. Therefore, what occurs inside the head is,\nin this sense, not sufficient to determine or fix everything that\noccurs in the mind.\n\nDespite some initially over-exuberant formulations of Putnam\n(1975)\u2014of the \u201cCut the pie any way you like, meaning just\nain\u2019t in the head\u201d, variety\u2014the correct conclusion\nof this thought experiment does not concern the location of\n(some) mental states but, rather, a claim about their\nindividuation. External individuation does not entail\nexternal location. Sunburn, as Davidson (1987) pointed out, is\nexternally individuated: individuation dependent on factors that lie\noutside the skin. Nevertheless, it is still located on the skin. That\nsome mental states are individuation dependent on circumstances that\nexist outside the skin of an individual does not entail that those\nmental states are located outside the individual\u2019s skin.\nBurge\u2019s \u201cArthritis\u201d Thought Experiment\n\nImagine a person, let us call him Larry, who has a number of beliefs\nabout arthritis. He believes that he has arthritis, that he has had it\nfor years, that arthritis can be very painful, and that it\u2019s\nbetter to have arthritis than pancreatic cancer, and so on. He also\nbelieves he has arthritis in his thigh. This belief, according to\nBurge, is (a) an arthritis-belief and (b) false. It is false because\narthritis is an affliction of the joints only. But why is it an\narthritis-belief\u2014a belief about arthritis? Burge\u2019s answer\nis that Larry inhabits a linguistic community made up of people who\nuse the term \u201carthritis\u201d in a certain way, and Larry would\nallow himself to be corrected by expert members of that community.\nThus, when a doctor tells him, \u201cNo, that\u2019s not arthritis\nyou have. Arthritis is an affliction of the joints\u201d. Larry would\nbe inclined to accept this, and revise his belief accordingly.\n\nNow we imagine Larry in a counterfactual situation. Counterfactual\nLarry is type-identical with Larry in point of functional profile,\nbehavioral dispositions, and experiential history (all\nindividualistically specified\u2014that is, specified in such a way\nthat does not presume the existence of anything outside Larry). The\ncounterfactuality of the situation pertains only to Larry\u2019s\nlinguistic community. In this counterfactual situation, the phonetic\nor syntactic form \u201carthritis\u201d\u2014as used by physicians,\nlexicographers, and competent laypersons\u2014applies not only to an\naffliction of the joints but also to various other rheumatoid\nailments. That is, in the counterfactual situation, the correct use of\nthe term \u201carthritis\u201d encompasses Larry\u2019s actual\nmisuse. In this counterfactual situation, Burge argues, Larry\npossesses a true belief about what is going on in his thigh but,\ncrucially, it is not an arthritis-belief. Rather, he has\nbeliefs about a distinct condition\u2014tharthritis, an\namalgam of arthritis and rheumatism, as we might regard it.\n\nIf this is correct, Larry\u2019s beliefs vary between actual and\ncounterfactual situations. Larry, however, is identical in both\nsituations. The only difference lies in the differing natures of his\nlinguistic communities\u2014specifically, the differing uses of the\nword-form, \u201carthritis\u201d. As in Putnam\u2019s\nthought-experiment, the difference in meaning again stems from a\ndifference in extension of a term, resulting in different\ntruth-conditions, truth-makers, and the like. But in Putnam\u2019s\ncase, the differences stem from differences in the natural\nenvironment. In Burge\u2019s thought experiment, these differences\nstem from differences in linguistic practice. As in the Putnam case,\nthe argument can easily be extended to the contents of propositional\nattitudes, and Burge, unlike Putnam, explicitly endorses this\nextension.\n",
