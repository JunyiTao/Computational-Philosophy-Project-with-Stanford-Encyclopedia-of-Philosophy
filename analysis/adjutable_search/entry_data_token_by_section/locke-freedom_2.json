    "main_text": "Freedom and Necessity\n4. Freedom and Necessity\nSome commentators think that Lockean freedom (or, as Locke also\ncalls it, \u201cliberty\u201d) is a single power, the power to do\nwhat one wills (Yolton 1970: 144; D. Locke 1975: 96; O\u2019Higgins\n1976: 119\u2014see Chappell 1994: 103). However, as Locke describes\nit, freedom is a \u201ctwo-way\u201d power, really a combination of\ntwo conditional powers belonging to an agent, that is, to someone\nendowed with a will (see Chappell 2007: 142). (A tennis ball, for\nexample, \u201chas not Liberty, is not a free Agent\u201d,\nbecause it is incapable of volition (E1\u20135 II.xxi.9: 238).) In E1,\nLocke\u2019s definition reflects his conception of the will as a\npower of preferring X to Y, or being more pleased\nwith X than with Y. But in E2\u20135, Locke\u2019s\ndefinition reflects his modified conception of the will as a power to\nissue commands to one\u2019s body or mind\n(see Section 2 above):\n\n [S]o far as a Man has a power to think, or not to think; to move,\nor not to move, according to the preference or direction of his own\nmind, so far is a Man Free. (E2\u20135 II.xxi.8: 237) \n So that the Idea of Liberty, is\nthe Idea of a Power in any Agent to do or forbear any\nparticular Action, according to the determination or thought of the\nmind, whereby either of them is preferr\u2019d to the other. (E2\u20135\nII.xxi.8: 237) \n Liberty is not an Idea belonging to Volition, or\npreferring; but to the Person having the Power of doing, or forbearing\nto do, according as the Mind shall chuse or direct. (E2\u20135 II.xxi.10:\n238)\n Liberty\u2026is the power a Man has to do or forbear\ndoing any particular Action, according as its doing or forbearance has\nthe actual preference in the Mind, which is the same thing as to say,\naccording as he himself wills it. (E1\u20135 II.xxi.15: 241)\n\nThe central claim here is that a human being (person, agent) is\nfree with respect to a particular action A (or forbearance to\nperform A) inasmuch as (i) if she wills to do A then she\nhas the power to do A and (ii) if she wills to forbear\ndoing A then she has the power to forbear doing A (see,\ne.g., Chappell 1994: \n 103).[5]\n So, for example, a woman in a locked room is\nnot free with respect to the act of leaving (or with respect to the\nforbearance to leave) because she does not have the power to leave if\nand when she wills to leave, and a woman who is falling (the bridge\nunder her having crumbled) is not free with respect to the forbearance\nto fall (or with respect to the act of falling) because she does not\nhave the power to forbear falling if she wills not to fall (E1\u20135\nII.xxi.9\u201310: 238). (Locke describes agents who are unfree with\nrespect to some action as acting under, or by, necessity\u2014E1\u20135\nII.xxi.8: 238; E1\u20135 II.xxi.9: 238.) But if the door of the room is\nunlocked, then the woman in the room is able to stay if she wills to\nstay, and is able to leave if she wills to leave: she is therefore\nboth free with respect to staying and free with respect to\nleaving. \nNotice that freedom, on Locke\u2019s conception of it, is a\nproperty of substances (persons, human beings, agents). This simply\nfollows from the fact that freedom is a dual power and from the fact\nthat \u201cPowers belong only to Agents,\nand are Attributes only of Substances\u201d (E1\u20135 II.xxi.16:\n241).  At no point does Locke offer an account of performing actions\nor forbearances freely, as if freedom were a way of\nperforming an action or a way of forbearing to perform an action. (For\na contrary view, see LoLordo 2012: 27.)\nLocke does write that\n[w]here-ever any performance or forbearance\nare not equally in a Man\u2019s power; where-ever doing or not doing,\nwill not equally follow upon the preference of his mind directing it,\nthere he is not Free. (E2\u20135 II.xxi.8: 237)\nThe \u201cfollow upon\u201d language might suggest a\ncounterfactual analysis of the claim that an agent has the power to\ndo A if she wills to do A, namely, that if she were to\nwill to do A then she would do A (e.g., Lowe 1995: 129;\nStuart 2013: 407\u2014for a similar account that trades the\nsubjunctive conditionals for indicative conditionals, see Yaffe 2000:\n15). The counterfactual analysis is tempting, but also unlikely to\ncapture Locke\u2019s meaning, especially if he has a Deflationary\nconception of action/forbearance (see Section 1\nabove). It might happen, for example, that I am prevented (by chains\nor a force field) from raising my arm, but that if I were to will that\nmy arm rise, you would immediately (break the chains or disable the\nforce field and) raise my arm. Under these conditions, I would not be\nfree with respect to my arm\u2019s rising, but it would be true that\nif I were to will that my arm rise, then my arm would rise. So\nLocke\u2019s dual power conception of freedom of action is not\ncaptured by any counterfactual conditional or pair of counterfactual\nconditionals.\nDoes Locke think that there is a conceptual connection between\nfreedom of action and voluntary action? It might be thought that\nfreedom with respect to a particular action requires that the action\nbe voluntary, so that if an action is not voluntary then one is not\nfree with respect to it. In defense of this, one might point to\nLocke\u2019s falling man, whose falling is not voluntary and who is\nalso not free with respect to the act of falling (Stuart 2013:\n408). But the falling man\u2019s unfreedom with respect to the act of\nfalling is not explained by the involuntariness of his\nfalling. In general, it is possible for one\u2019s action to be\ninvoluntary even as one is free with respect to it. Imagine that you\nlet your four-year old daughter raise your arm (just for\nfun). According to Locke\u2019s conception of voluntariness, the\nmotion of your arm is not voluntary, because it is not caused by any\nvolition of yours (indeed, we can even imagine that you do not even\nhave a volition that your arm rise). But, according to Locke\u2019s\nconception of freedom, you are most certainly free with respect to\nyour arm\u2019s rising: (i) if you will that your arm rise, you have\nthe power to raise it, and (ii) if you will that your arm not rise,\nyou have the power to forbear raising it.\nVoluntariness, then, is not necessary for freedom; but it is also\nnot sufficient for freedom, as Locke\u2019s \u201clocked room\u201d\nand \u201cparalytick\u201d cases show. The man in the locked room\nwills to stay and talk to the other person in the room, and this\nvolition is causally responsible for his staying in the room: on\nLocke\u2019s theory, his remaining in the room is, therefore,\nvoluntary. But the man in the locked room \u201cis not at liberty not\nto stay, he has not freedom to be gone\u201d (E1\u20135 II.xxi.10:\n238). The reason is that even if the man wills to leave, he does not\nhave the power to leave. Similarly, if the paralyzed person wills to\nremain at rest (thinking, mistakenly, that he could move if he willed\nto move) and his remaining at rest is caused (at least in part) by his\nvolition not to move, then his \u201csitting still\u2026is truly\nvoluntary\u201d. But in this case, says Locke, \u201cthere is want\nof Freedom\u201d because \u201ca Palsie [hinders] his Legs\nfrom obeying the determination of his Mind, if it would thereby\ntransferr his Body to another Place\u201d (E2\u20135 II.xxi.11: 239): that\nis, the paralyzed person is unable to move even if he wills to\nmove.\nThus far, we have been focusing on freedom with respect to motion\nor rest of one\u2019s body. But, as we have seen, Locke\nthinks that actions encompass acts of mind (in addition to acts of\nbody). So, in addition to thinking that some acts of mind are\nvoluntary (e.g., the mental acts of combining and abstracting ideas\ninvolved in the production of abstract ideas of mixed modes\u2014E2\u20135\nII.xxxii.12: 387\u2013388), Locke thinks that we are free with\nrespect to some mental actions (and their forbearances). For example,\nif I am able to combine two ideas at will, and I am able to forbear\ncombining two ideas if I will not to combine them, then I am free with\nrespect to the mental action of combining two ideas. It can also\nhappen that we are not free with respect to our mental acts:\nA Man on the Rack, is not at liberty\nto lay by the Idea of pain, and divert himself with other\nContemplations. (E4\u20135 II.xxi.12: 239)\nIn this case, even though the man on the rack might will to be rid\nof the pain, he does not have the power to avoid feeling\nit.[6]\n",
