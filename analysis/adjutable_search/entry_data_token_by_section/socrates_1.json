    "main_text": "The Socratic problem: Who was Socrates really?\n2. The Socratic problem: Who was Socrates really?\n\nThe Socratic problem is a rat\u2019s nest of complexities arising\nfrom the fact that various people wrote about Socrates whose\naccounts differ in crucial respects, leaving us to wonder which, if\nany, are accurate representations of the historical Socrates.\n\u201cThere is, and always will be, a \u2018Socratic problem\u2019.\nThis is inevitable,\u201d said Guthrie (1969, 6), looking back on a\ngnarled history between ancient and contemporary times that is\nnarrated in detail by Press (1996), but barely touched on below. The\ndifficulties are increased because all those who knew and wrote about\nSocrates lived before any standardization of modern categories of, or\nsensibilities about, what constitutes historical accuracy or poetic\nlicense. All authors present their own interpretations of the\npersonalities and lives of their characters, whether they mean to or\nnot, whether they write fiction or biography or philosophy (if the\nphilosophy they write has characters), so other criteria must be\nintroduced for deciding among the contending views of who Socrates\nreally was. A look at the three primary ancient sources of information\nabout Socrates (\u00a72.1) will provide a foundation for appreciating\nhow contemporary interpretations differ (\u00a72.2) and why the\ndifferences matter (\u00a72.3).\n\nOne thing is certain about the historical Socrates: even among those\nwho knew him in life, there was profound disagreement about what his\nactual views and methods were. This is evident in the three\ncontemporaneous sources below; and it is hinted at in the few titles\nand scraps by other authors of the time who are now lumped together as\n\u2018minor Socratics\u2019, not for the quality of their work but\nbecause so little or none of it is extant. We shall probably never\nknow much about their views of Socrates (see Giannantoni\n 1990).[2]\n After Socrates\u2019s death, the tradition became even more\ndisparate. As Nehamas (1999, 99) puts it, \u201cwith the exception of\nthe Epicureans, every philosophical school in antiquity, whatever its\norientation, saw in him either its actual founder or the type of\nperson to whom its adherents were to aspire.\u201d\n",
