    "main_text": "Logical developments and paradoxes until 1930 || Set Theory and paradoxes: circular sets and other matters\n4.1 Set Theory and paradoxes: circular sets and other matters\n\nDo circular objects exist in set theory? Zermelo\u2019s view of sets\nas axiomatized in 1908 did not in itself exclude the possibility of\nself-membership. The problem was raised anew by Mirimanoff (1917a,\n1917b, 1920; see also the entry\n Zermelo\u2019s axiomatization of set theory).\n Once circular sets are allowed, a strengthening of extensional\nequality by means of a suitable isomorphism relation\n(bisimulation, in current terminology) is needed which essentially\ncorresponds to the isomorphism of the trees picturing the given sets.\nRussell\u2019s argument then suggests a distinction between sets\nof first kind, which are not isomorphic with any of their own\nelements, and sets of second kind which are indeed isomorphic\nwith at least one of their elements. In the light of this distinction,\nRussell\u2019s contradiction shows that the collection R of sets\nof first kind does not exist as a set. Indeed, a set of second\nkind always contains a set of second kind; hence a set of sets of\nfirst kind must be of first kind. If \\(R\\) were a set, it should be of\nfirst kind; but then it could not contain all sets of first kind.\nMirimanoff 1917a then introduced the fundamental distinction between\nordinary (well-founded) and extraordinary\n(non-well-founded) sets: a set \\(X\\) is ordinary if every\n\\(\\in\\)-descending chain in \\(X\\) is finite; it is extraordinary,\notherwise (there exist infinite \\(\\in\\)-descending chains). It follows\nthat all sets of the second kind are extraordinary, but the converse\nis not true (for instance, consider the set \\(E=\\{e_1, E_1\\}\\), where\n\\(E_1 = \\{e_1,e_2, E_2 \\}\\), \\(E_2 =\\{e_1, e_2, e_3, E_3\\}\\),\netc.).\n\nFor the history of paradoxes, it is important to emphasize that\nMirimanoff 1917a gave a generalization of the Burali-Forti antinomy,\nthe paradox of grounded sets. This paradox actually proves\nthat the collection \\(\\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{F}\\) of ordinary sets (on a\ngiven set of atoms) is not itself a set. Indeed, let\n\\(\\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{F}\\) be the set of grounded (= ordinary =\nwellfounded) sets; then \\(\\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{F}\\) itself is grounded,\nfor were \\(\\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{F} \\ni x_0 \\ni x_1 \\ni x_2\\ldots\\), then\n\\(x_0\\) would be an ungrounded member of \\(\\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{F}\\),\nwhich is absurd. Hence \\(\\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{F} \\in\n\\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{F}\\), so \\(\\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{F}\\) is ungrounded,\ncontradiction (the same paradox will also appear in Shen-Yuting\n1953).\n\nMirimanoff\u2019s work is also important for the foundations of set\ntheory. He introduced the notion of ordinal rank for ordinary sets and\nhe noticed that ordinary sets can be arranged in a cumulative\nhierarchy, indexed by their ranks. However, the existence of a\ncumulative structure of ordinary sets is not considered as a ground\nfor excluding extraordinary sets. Mirimanoff (pp. 212\u2013213)\nexplicitly points to the use of extraordinary sets for modelling\nmirror-like situations. He mentions the case of a book \\(B\\)\nwhose covering is decorated with a picture \\(J\\) representing two\nchildren glancing at the same book, i.e. to the picture \\(J1\\) of\n\\(B\\). In \\(J_1\\) one could perceive again the two children and the\npicture \\(J_{11}\\) of the book in perspective. Now \\(J\\) can be\nregarded as a set including as elements the two children \\(e_1\\) and\n\\(e_2\\), and the picture \\(J_1\\) of \\(J\\), which in turn decomposes\ninto the pictures \\(e_{11}, e_{22}\\) of \\(e_1\\) and \\(e_2\\), and the\npicture \\(J_{11}\\) of \\(J_1\\), and so on ad infinitum, Now \\(J\\) is\nisomorphic to one of its elements, i.e. \\(J_1: J\\) can be considered\nas a set of second kind and hence extraordinary. This non-mathematical\nexample is suggestive of later developments, i.e., the theory of\nnon-well founded sets and its recent applications to semantics. A set\n\\(E\\) of second kind is also assimilated to an impredicative\ncollection in the sense of Poincar\u00e9 (Mirimanoff 1920, p. 34)\nbecause of its circularity: indeed, \\(E\\) is given by a condition\n\\(E=(y, z,\\ldots ,a, b, c,\\ldots)\\), where \\(y, z,\\ldots\\) depend on\n\\(E\\).\n\nOn the other hand, in Mirimanoff\u2019s 1917a there is a remarkable\nuse of Burali-Forti\u2019s paradox which suggests a necessary\ncondition for set-hood in terms of size, viz., if a collection is in\nbijection with the set of all ordinals, then it does not exist as a\nset. In Mirimanoff 1917a,b, one can also find the idea of von Neumann\nordinal (von Neumann 1923, 1925) and a form of the replacement axiom\nis present.\n\nVon Neumann\u2019s system of 1925 deals with an alternative axiomatic\nfoundation of set theory. There are two sorts of objects: objects of\ntype II (functions, corresponding to classes) and objects of type I\n(arguments), linked by the application operation of a function to its\narguments. The two domains partly overlap and there are objects of\ntype I\u2013II, corresponding to sets (as functions which can also be\narguments). The fundamental axiom IV-2 then states that an object\n\\(a\\) is a proper class (i.e., it is not type I\u2013II) if and only\nif the totality of its members can be mapped onto the totality of all\narguments. The Burali-Forti antinomy shows that the class\n\\(\\mathbf{ON}\\) of all ordinals is not a set, which implies with axiom\nIV-2 that there is an application of \\(\\mathbf{ON}\\) onto the universe\nof all sets, and hence that the universe of sets is\nwell-ordered. Conceptually, the system settles the problem of\nmaking Cantor\u2019s distinction between inconsistent and consistent\nprecise and applicable (against Hilbert\u2019s early criticism); it\nalso shows that global choice becomes a theorem on a suitable view of\nsets. Though circular objects cannot live in von Neumann\u2019s\nhierarchical model of set theory, they can be found in the\ninvestigations of other mathematicians and logicians, e.g., Finsler.\nAccording to Finsler, paradoxes hinge upon circular notions, but\ncircularity does not necessarily lead to contradictions. In\nparticular, Finsler regards Cantor\u2019s notion of set as\nintrinsically circular: sets depend on sets or on general things\ndepending also on sets and the associated dependence graph\ncan drive us back in a circle. For the contemporary reader, it is\nworth mentioning that an original intuition of Finsler 1926b is the\nuse of graph theory for representing circular structures. So\narrows are used for interpreting membership, and it is not difficult\nto imagine a set that has itself as unique element and more\ncomplicated circular situations (for more on Finsler\u2019s set\ntheory see Holmes 1996 in Other Internet Resources). Finsler 1926\napplies Richard\u2019s paradox in order to produce metamathematical\nresults, in particular \u2018formally undecidable\npropositions\u2019. However, Finsler\u2019s arguments are not\nconclusive and cannot be considered a proper anticipation of the\nG\u00f6del incompleteness theorems (on the limit of his ideas, see the\ndiscussion in van Heijenoort, 438\u2013440); but they show that an\nattentive reading of the paradox might have unexpected\napplications.\n",
