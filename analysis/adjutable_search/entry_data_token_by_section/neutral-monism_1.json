    "main_text": "Neutral Monism || Monism\n1.2 Monism\n\nThere is, then, considerable disagreement about how to interpret the\nnotion of neutrality. The notion of monism raises its own problems.\nBut as these are questions faced by all forms of monism, they are,\nperhaps, not quite as pressing. As with the case of the notion of\nneutrality employed, it is possible to distinguish different versions\nof neutral monism based on the various ways they understand the notion\nof monism (see Schaffer 2016). Neutral monism might, for example, be\ninterpreted as a form of existence monism\u2014the view that only a\nsingle concrete thing exists; but it might also interpreted as a\nmonism about the kinds of things there are\u2014the view that\nconcrete things, be they simple or complex, are of the same neutral\nkind. The evidence suggests that all past and present versions of\nneutral monism have been pluralist on both these counts: they work\nwith a plurality of basic neutral entities; and, given their focus on\nthe mind-body problem, they recognize at least mental and physical\nkinds of entities in addition to the neutral ones (though some\ndescribe them as useful fictions). All entities belonging to such\nnon-neutral kinds must, however, count as derivative. In the final\nanalysis, all entities must be basic neutral entities or complexes of\nsuch entities.\n\nThe talk about basic entities indicates another pluralist dimension:\nthe known versions of neutral monism work with a layered picture of\nreality. Basic neutral entities form the bottom level of the\nhierarchy; the non-basic, non-neutral entities at the higher levels\nare composed of, or are in some sense derivative from, those lower\nlevel neutral entities. So we are dealing with an ontology that\nrecognizes a plurality of levels or layers in reality.\n\nAnd even within the level of the basic neutral entities we can\ndistinguish those versions of neutral monism that hold that all basic\nentities belong to a single category, from those that distinguish two\nor more categories of neutral entities. Russell\u2019s later version\nof neutral monism seems to be monistic (in this particular sense): all\nneutral entities are\n events.[2]\n But it is easy to envision a neutral monism that countenances neutral\nsubstances and neutral properties among the basic neutral\n entities.[3]\n",
