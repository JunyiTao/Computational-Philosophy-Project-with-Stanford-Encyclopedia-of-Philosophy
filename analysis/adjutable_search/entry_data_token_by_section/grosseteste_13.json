    "main_text": "Scientific Method\n12. Influence\nBy the fourteenth century, Grosseteste had achieved the unusual\nstatus of being an authoritative figure for Oxford\nthinkers\u2014someone from whose writings quotations might be\nmarshalled, on the strength of his name, in defense of one\u2019s\nviews. Thus, both Thomas Bradwardine and Thomas Buckingham appeal to\nGrosseteste in support of their conflicting views on future\ncontingency. John Wyclif likewise appeals to Grosseteste as a fellow\ntraveller in support of his views on the continuum, among other\nissues, ranking him with Plato, Democritus and Augustine as one of the\ngreatest of thinkers. Such appeals are signs of the reverence with\nwhich Grosseteste was held in fourteenth-century Oxford.  \nThe influence of specific ideas of Grosseteste\u2019s may be found in\nnumerous thinkers, especially those who flourished at Oxford. Their\nnumber includes Adam of Wodeham, John Wyclif, Robert Kilwardby, Thomas Bradwardine, Thomas Buckingham, Thomas of York, Walter Burley, William of Alnwick, William of Ockham, and others. But his greatest influence as\na philosopher, if we leave aside his commentary on the Posterior analytics, was perhaps as a source of ideas for thinkers\nflourishing in the first half of the thirteenth century. In\nparticular, Richard Rufus of Cornwall makes extensive use of\nGrosseteste\u2019s writings in his large Scriptum on Aristotle\u2019s\nMetaphysics and his Oxford commentary on the Sentences\nof Peter Lombard, as does his Oxford contemporary Richard Fishacre in\nhis commentary on the Sentences. These thinkers were heavily\ninfluenced by Grosseteste\u2019s On Free Decision as well as by his\nwritings on the eternity of the world. Rufus also praises\nGrosseteste\u2019s scientific and mathematical expertise, as does Roger\nBacon, a man by temperament more given to scorn than praise.\nGrosseteste\u2019s philosophical influence on the Continent appears to\nhave been largely as a scholar of Aristotle. His commentary on the\nPosterior Analytics achieved renown across the Continent and\nwas used throughout the middle ages (for its influence in Britain see Rossi 2012), and the same was true of his\ntranslation of the Ethics.  Indeed, these two pieces of\nAristotelian scholarship alone would have sufficed to acquire for\nGrossetete an important place in the history of medieval thought. One exception, however, is the fourteenth-century French thinker, Nicole Oresme, who makes use of a number of Grosseteste\u2019s philosophical and scientific writings in his works, most notably in his Questiones super Physicam.\n",
