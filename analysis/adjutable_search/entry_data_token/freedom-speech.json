Introduction: Boundaries of the Debate\n\nThe topic of free speech is one of the most contentious issues in\nliberal societies. If liberty of expression is not highly valued, as\nhas often been the case, there is no problem; freedom of expression is\nsimply curtailed in favor of other values. It becomes a volatile issue\nwhen it is highly valued because only then do the limitations placed\nupon it become controversial. The first thing to note in any sensible\ndiscussion of freedom of speech is that it will have to be limited.\nEvery society places some limits on the exercise of speech because it\nalways takes place within a context of competing values. In this\nsense, Stanley Fish is correct when he says that there is no such\nthing as free speech (in the sense of unlimited speech). Free speech\nis simply a useful term to focus our attention on a particular form of\nhuman interaction and the phrase is not meant to suggest that speech\nshould never be limited. One does not have to fully agree with Fish\nwhen he says , \u201cfree speech in short, is not an independent\nvalue but a political prize\u201d (1994,102) but it is the case that\nno society has existed where speech has not been limited to some\nextent. Haworth (1998) makes a similar point when he suggests that a\nright to freedom of speech is not something we have, not something we\nown, in the same way as we possess arms and legs. \n\nAlexander and Horton (1984) agree. They note that \u201cspeech\u201d\nencapsulates many different activities: speaking, writing, singing,\nacting, burning flags, yelling on the street corner, advertising,\nthreats, slander and so on. One reason for thinking that speech is not\nspecial simpiciter is that some of these forms of\ncommunication are more important than others and hence require\ndifferent levels of protection. For example, the freedom to criticize\na government is generally thought to be more important than the\nfreedom of an artist to offend her audience. If two speech acts clash\n(when yelling prevents a political speech) a decision has to be made\nto prioritize one over the other, which means that there can be no\nunlimited right to free speech. For example, Alexander and Horton\n(1984) claim that arguments defending speech on democratic grounds\nhave many parts. One is a claim that the public needs a great deal of\ninformation in order to make informed decisions. Another is that\nbecause government is the servant of the people, it should not be\nallowed to censor them. Such arguments show that one of the main\nreasons for justifying free speech (political speech) is important,\nnot for its own sake but because it allows us to exercise another\nimportant value (democracy). Whatever reasons we offer to protect\nspeech can also be used to show why some speech is not special. If\nspeech is defended because it promotes autonomy, we no longer have\ngrounds for protecting speech acts that undermine this value. If our\ndefence of speech is that it is crucial to a well-functioning\ndemocracy, we have no reason to defend speech that is irrelevant to,\nor undermines, this goal. And if we agree with John Stuart Mill (1978)\nthat speech should be protected because it leads to the truth, there\nseems no reason to protect the speech of anti-vaccers or creationists.\n\n\nSpeech is important because we are socially situated and it makes\nlittle sense to say that Robinson Crusoe has a right to free speech.\nIt only becomes necessary to talk of such a right within a social\nsetting, and appeals to an abstract and absolute right to free speech\nhinder rather than help the debate. At a minimum, speech will have to\nbe limited for the sake of order. If we all speak at once, we end up\nwith an incoherent noise. Without some rules and procedures we cannot\nhave a conversation at all and consequently speech has to be limited\nby protocols of basic civility. \n\nIt is true that many human rights documents give a prominent place to\nthe right to speech and conscience, but such documents also place\nlimits on what can be said because of the harm and offense that\nunlimited speech can cause, (I will discuss this in more detail\nlater). Outside of the United States of America speech does not tend\nto have a specially protected status and it has to compete with other\nrights claims for our allegiance. John Stuart Mill, one of the great\ndefenders of free speech, summarized these points in On\nLiberty, where he suggests that a struggle always takes place\nbetween the competing demands of authority and liberty. He claimed\nthat we cannot have the latter without the former: \n\nAll that makes existence valuable to anyone depends on the\nenforcement of restraints upon the actions of other people. Some rules\nof conduct, therefore, must be imposed\u2014by law in the first\nplace, and by opinion on many things which are not fit subjects for\nthe operation of law. (1978, 5)\n\n\nThe task, therefore, is not to argue for an unlimited domain of free\nspeech; such a concept cannot be defended. Instead, we need to decide\nhow much value we place on speech in relation to other important\nideals such as privacy, security, democratic equality and the\nprevention of harm and there is nothing inherent to speech that\nsuggests it must always win out in competition with these values.\nSpeech is part of a package deal of social goods: \u201cspeech, in\nshort, is never a value in and of itself but is always produced within\nthe precincts of some assumed conception of the good\u201d (Fish,\n1994, 104). In this essay, I will examine some conceptions of the good\nthat are deemed to be acceptable limitations on speech. I will start\nwith the harm principle and then move on to other more encompassing\narguments for limiting speech. \n\nBefore we do this, however, the reader might wish to disagree with the\nabove claims and warn of the dangers of the \u201cslippery\nslope.\u201d As Frederick Schauer (1985) has demonstrated, slippery\nslope arguments make the claim that a current acceptable change (he\ncalls this the instant case) to the status quo regarding speech will\nlead to some intolerable future state of affairs (what he calls the\ndanger case) once the instant case prohibiting speech is introduced.\nThe assumption is that the instant case is acceptable; otherwise it\nwould be critiqued in its own right. The complaint is that a change\nfrom the status quo to the instant case will lead to unwanted future\nlimitations on speech and should be avoided (even if a change to the\ninstant case would be immediately desirable). The slippery slope\nargument has to make a clear distinction between the instant and the\ndanger case. If the former was part of the latter then it is not a\nslippery slope argument but simply an assertion about the unwarranted\nbreadth of the instant case. The claim being made is that a change to\nan acceptable instant case that is distinct from the danger case\nshould nevertheless be prohibited because a change from the status quo\nto the instant case will necessarily transport us to the danger case.\n\n\nAs Schuer says this is not very compelling because it needs to be\ndemonstrated, rather than merely stated, that the move from the status\nquo is so much more likely to lead to the danger case. Part of the\nproblem is that slippery slope arguments are often presented in a way\nthat suggests we can be on or off the slope. In fact, no such choice\nexists: we are necessarily on the slope whether we like it or\nnot, and the task is always to decide how far up or down we choose to\ngo, not whether we should step off the slope altogether. We need to\nkeep in mind that the slippery-slope claim is not that the proposed\ninstant case will lead to minor changes in the future, but that a\nsmall change now will have drastic and tyrannical consequences. The\nslippery-slope argument seems to suggest that the instant case is so\nflawed that any change to it from the status quo (which again, is a\nposition already on the slope) puts us in imminent threat of sliding\ninto the danger case. Unfortunately, the causal mechanisms for how\nthis must necessarily happen are usually unspecified. Anyone\nmaking such claims should be willing to demonstrate how this unlikely\nevent will happen before being taken seriously. Such a person is not\nsimply advocating caution; she is claiming that there is an imminent\nrisk of moving from an acceptable instant case to an unacceptable\ndanger case. This is not to say that slippage cannot occur. One\nsafeguard against this is to be as precise as possible in our use of\nlanguage. If harm to others is our preferred stopping point on the\nslope, we need to specify in clear terms what counts as harm and what\ndoes not. Sometimes we will fail in this task, but precision puts\nbrakes on the instant case and limits its capacity for sliding down\nthe slope. \n\nThose who support the slippery slope argument tend to make the claim\nthat the inevitable consequence of limiting speech is a slide into\ncensorship and tyranny. It is worth noting, however, that the slippery\nslope argument can be used to make the opposite point; one could argue\nthat we should not allow any removal of government interventions (on\nspeech or any other type of freedom) because once we do we are on the\nslippery slope to anarchy, the state of nature, and a life that Hobbes\ndescribed in Leviathan as \u201csolitary, poore, nasty,\nbrutish, and short\u201d (1968, 186). It is possible that some\nlimits on speech might, over time, lead to further\nrestrictions\u2014but they might not. And if they do, those\nlimitations might also be justified. The main point is that once we\nabandon the incoherent position that there should be no limits on\nspeech, we have to make controversial decisions about what can and\ncannot be expressed; this comes along with the territory of living\ntogether in communities.\n\n\nAnother thing to note before we engage with specific arguments for\nlimiting speech is that we are in fact free to speak as we like.\nHence, freedom of speech differs from some other types of free action.\nIf the government wants to prevent citizens engaging in certain\nactions, riding motor bikes for example, it can limit their freedom to\ndo so by making sure that such vehicles are no longer available;\ncurrent bikes could be destroyed and a ban can be placed on future\nimports. Freedom of speech is a different case. A government can limit\nsome forms of free expression by banning books, plays, films etc. but\nit cannot make it impossible to say certain things. The only thing it\ncan do is punish people after they have spoken. This means\nthat we are free to speak in a way that we are not free to ride\noutlawed motorbikes. This is an important point; if we insist that\nlegal prohibitions remove freedom then we have to hold the\nincoherent position that a person was unfree at the very moment she\nperformed a speech act. The government would have to remove our vocal\ncords for us to be unfree in the same way as the motorcyclist is\nunfree.\n\nA more persuasive analysis suggests that the threat of a sanction\nmakes it more difficult and potentially more costly to exercise our\nfreedom of speech. Such sanctions take two major forms. The first, and\nmost serious, is legal punishment by the state, which usually consists\nof a financial penalty, but can stretch to imprisonment (which then,\nof course, further restricts the persons free speech). The second\nthreat of sanction comes from social disapprobation. People will often\nrefrain from making public statements because they fear the ridicule\nand moral outrage of others. For example, one could expect to be\npublicly condemned if one made racist comments during a public lecture\nat a university. Usually it is the first type of sanction that catches\nour attention but, as we will see, John Stuart Mill provides a strong\nwarning about the chilling effect of the latter form of social\ncontrol.\n\nWe seem to have reached a paradoxical position. I started by claiming\nthat there can be no such thing as a pure form of free speech: now I\nseem to be arguing that we are, in fact, free to say anything we like.\nThe paradox is resolved by thinking of free speech in the following\nterms. I am, indeed, free to say (but not necessarily to publish) what\nI like, but the state and other individuals can sometimes make that\nfreedom more or less costly to exercise. This leads to the conclusion\nthat we can attempt to regulate speech, but we cannot prevent it if a\nperson is undeterred by the threat of sanction. The issue, therefore,\nboils down to assessing how cumbersome we wish to make it for people\nto say certain things. I have already suggested that all societies do\n(correctly) make some speech more costly than others. If the reader\ndoubts this, it might be worth considering what life would be like\nwith no sanctions on libelous statements, child pornography,\nadvertising content, and releasing state secrets. The list could go\non. \n\nThe conclusion to be drawn is that the problem we face is deciding\nwhere, not whether, to place limits on speech, and the next sections\nlook at some possible solutions to this puzzle. \n2. The Harm Principle and Free Speech\n2.1 John Stuart Mill's Harm Principle\n\nGiven that Mill presented one of the first, and still perhaps the most\nfamous liberal defense of free speech, I will focus on his arguments\nin this essay and use them as a springboard for a more general\ndiscussion of free expression. In the footnote at the beginning of\nChapter II of On Liberty, Mill makes a very bold statement:\n\n\nIf the arguments of the present chapter are of any validity, there\nought to exist the fullest liberty of professing and discussing, as a\nmatter of ethical conviction, any doctrine, however immoral it may be\nconsidered. (1978, 15)\n\n\nThis is a very strong defense of free speech; Mill tells us that\nany doctrine should be allowed the light of day no matter\nhow immoral it may seem to everyone else. And Mill does mean\neveryone: \n\nIf all mankind minus one were of one opinion, and only one person\nwere of the contrary opinion, mankind would be no more justified in\nsilencing that one person than he, if he had the power, would be\njustified in silencing mankind. (1978, 16)\n\n\nSuch liberty should exist with every subject matter so that we have\n\u201cabsolute freedom of opinion and sentiment on all subjects,\npractical or speculative, scientific, moral or theological\u201d\n(1978, 11). Mill claims that the fullest liberty of expression is\nrequired to push our arguments to their logical limits, rather than\nthe limits of social embarrassment. Such liberty of expression is\nnecessary, he suggests, for the dignity of persons. If liberty of\nexpression is stifled, the price paid is \u201ca sort of intellectual\npacification\u201d that sacrifices \u201c the entire moral courage of the human\nmind\u201d (1978, 31).\n\nThese are powerful claims for freedom of speech, but as I noted above,\nMill also suggests that we need some rules of conduct to regulate the\nactions of members of a political community. The limitation he places\non free expression is \u201cone very simple principle\u201d (1978,\n9), now usually referred to as the harm principle, which states\nthat\n\n\u2026the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any\nmember of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm\nto others. (1978, 9)\n\n\nThere is a great deal of debate about what Mill had in mind when he\nreferred to harm; for the purposes of this essay he will be taken to\nmean that an action has to directly and in the first instance invade\nthe rights of a person (Mill himself uses the term rights, despite\nbasing the arguments in the book on the principle of utility). The\nlimits on free speech will be very narrow because it is difficult to\nsupport the claim that most speech causes harm to the rights of\nothers. This is the position staked out by Mill in the first two\nchapters of On Liberty and it is a good starting point for a\ndiscussion of free speech because it is hard to imagine a more liberal\nposition. Liberals are usually willing to contemplate limiting speech\nonce it can be demonstrated that it does invade the rights of\nothers.\n\nIf we accept Mill's argument we need to ask \u201cwhat types of\nspeech, if any, cause harm?\u201d Once we can answer this question,\nwe have found the appropriate limits to free expression. The example\nMill uses is in reference to corn dealers: he suggests that it is\nacceptable to claim that corn dealers starve the poor if such a view\nis expressed in print. It is not acceptable to make such statements to\nan angry mob, ready to explode, that has gathered outside the house of\nthe corn dealer. The difference between the two is that the latter is\nan expression \u201csuch as to constitute\u2026a positive\ninstigation to some mischievous act,\u201d (1978, 53), namely, to\nplace the rights, and possibly the life, of the corn dealer in danger.\nAs Daniel Jacobson (2000) notes, it is important to remember that Mill\nwill not sanction limits to free speech simply because someone is\nharmed. For example, the corn dealer may suffer severe financial\nhardship if he is accused of starving the poor. Mill distinguishes\nbetween legitimate and illegitimate harm, and it is only when speech\ncauses a direct and clear violation of rights that it can be limited.\nThe fact that Mill does not count accusations of starving the poor as\ncausing illegitimate harm to the rights of corn dealers suggests he\nwished to apply the harm principle sparingly. Other examples where the\nharm principle may apply include libel laws, blackmail, advertising\nblatant untruths about commercial products, advertising dangerous\nproducts to children (e.g. cigarettes), and securing truth in\ncontracts. In most of these cases, it is possible to show that harm\ncan be caused and that rights can be violated.\n2.2 Mill's Harm Principle and Pornography\n\nThere are other instances when the harm principle has been invoked but\nwhere it is more difficult to demonstrate that rights have been\nviolated. Perhaps the most obvious example is the debate over\npornography. As Feinberg notes in Offense to Others: the Moral\nLimits of the Criminal Law, most attacks on pornography up to the\n1970s were from social conservatives who found such material to be\nimmoral and obscene. This type of argument has died away in recent\ntimes and the case against pornography has been taken up by some\nfeminists who often distinguish between erotica, which is acceptable,\nand pornography, which is not, because it is claimed it degrades,\nharms, and endangers the lives of women. The harm principle can be\ninvoked against pornography if it can be demonstrated that it violates\nthe rights of women. \nThis is an approach taken by Catherine MacKinnon (1987). She takes\nseriously the distinction between pornography and erotica. Erotica\nmight be explicit and create sexual arousal, but neither is grounds\nfor complaint. Pornography would not come under attack if it did the\nsame thing as erotica; the complaint is that it portrays women in a\nmanner that harms them.\n\nWhen pornography involves young children, most people accept that it\nshould be prohibited because it harms persons under the age of\nconsent (although the principle would not necessarily rule out people\nover the age of consent from portraying minors). It has proved more\ndifficult to make the same claim for consenting adults. It is\ndifficult to know if the people who appear in books, magazines, films,\nvideos and on the internet are being physically harmed. If they are we\nthen need to show why this is sufficiently different from other forms\nof harmful employment that is not prohibited, such as hard manual\nlabour, or very dangerous jobs. Much of the work in pornography seems\nto be demeaning and unpleasant but the same can be said for many forms\nof work and again it is unclear why the harm principle can be used to\nsingle out pornography. MacKinnon's (1987) claim that women who make a\nliving through pornography are sexual slaves seems to exaggerate the\ncase. If conditions in the pornography industry are particularly bad,\nstronger regulation rather than prohibition might be a better option,\nparticularly as the latter will not make the industry go away. \n\nIt is also difficult to demonstrate that pornography results in harm\nto women as a whole. Very few people would deny that violence against\nwomen is abhorrent and an all too common feature of our society, but\nhow much of this is caused by pornography? MacKinnon, Andrea Dworkin,\n(1981) and many others, have attempted to show a causal link but this\nhas proven challenging because one needs to show that a person who\nwould not rape, batter or otherwise violate the rights of women was\ncaused to do so through exposure to pornography. Caroline West\nprovides a useful overview of the literature and suggests that even\nthough pornography might not dispose most men to rape, it might make\nit more likely for those men who are already so inclined. She uses the\nanalogy of smoking. We have good grounds for saying that smoking makes\ncancer more likely even though smoking is neither a necessary nor\nsufficient condition for causing cancer. One possible problem with\nthis analogy is that we have very powerful evidence that smoking does\nsignificantly increase the possibility of cancer; the evidence\nsuggesting that viewing pornography leads men (already inclined) to\nrape women is not as robust. \n\nIf pornographers were exhorting their readers to commit violence and\nrape, the case for prohibition would be much stronger, but they tend\nnot to do this, just as films that depict murder do not actively\nincite the audience to mimic what they see on the screen. For the sake\nof argument let us grant that the consumption of pornography does lead\nsome men to commit acts of violence. Such a concession might not prove\nto be decisive. The harm principle might be a necessary, but it is not\na sufficient reason for censorship. If pornography causes a small\npercentage of men to act violently we still need an argument for why\nthe liberty of all consumers of pornography (men and women) has to be\ncurtailed because of the violent actions of a few. We have\noverwhelming evidence that consuming alcohol causes a lot of violence\n(against women and men) but this does not mean that alcohol should be\nprohibited. Very few people reach this conclusion despite the clarity\nof the evidence. Further questions need to be answered before a ban is\njustified. How many people are harmed? What is the frequency of the\nharm? How strong is the evidence that A is causing B? Would\nprohibition limit the harm and if so, by how much? Would censorship\ncause problems greater than the harm it is meant to negate? Can the\nharmful effects be prevented by measures other than prohibition?\n\nThere are other non-physical harms that also have to be taken into\nconsideration. MacKinnon argues that pornography causes harm because\nit exploits, oppresses, subordinates and undermines the civil rights\nof women, including their right to free speech. A permissive policy on\npornography has the effect of prioritizing the right to speech of\npornographers over the right to speech of women. MacKinnon's claim is\nthat pornography silences women because it presents them as inferior\nbeings and sex objects who are not to be taken seriously. Even if\npornography does not cause violence, it still leads to discrimination,\ndomination and rights violations. She also suggests that because\npornography offers a misleading and derogatory view of women, it is\nlibelous. Along with Andrea Dworkin, MacKinnon drafted a Minneapolis\nCouncil Ordinance in 1983 that allowed women to take civil action\nagainst pornographers. They defined pornography as:\n\n\u2026the graphic sexually explicit subordination of women through\npictures or words that also includes women dehumanized as sexual\nobjects, things, or commodities; enjoying pain or humiliation or rape;\nbeing tied up, cut up, mutilated, bruised, or physically hurt; in\npostures of sexual submission or servility or display; reduced to body\nparts, penetrated by objects or animals, or presented in scenarios of\ndegradation, injury, torture; shown as filthy or inferior; bleeding,\nbruised or hurt in a context which makes these conditions\nsexual (1987, 176).\n\nSuch arguments have so far not led to the prohibition of pornography\n(which was not the intent of the Ordinance) and many liberals remain\nunconvinced. One reason that some doubt MacKinnon's claims is that the\nlast twenty years have seen an explosion of pornography on the\ninternet without a concurrent erosion of women's rights. If those\narguing that pornography causes harm are right, we should expect to\nsee a large increase in physical abuse against women and a hefty\ndecrease in their civil rights, employment in the professions, and\npositions in higher education. The evidence does not seem to show this\nand social conditions for women today are better than 30 years ago\nwhen pornography was less prevalent. What does seem to be reasonably\nclear, at least in the USA, is that the increased consumption of\npornography over the last 20 years has coincided with a reduction in\nviolent crime against women, including rape. If we return to West's\nsmoking analogy, we would have to rethink our view that smoking causes\ncancer if a large increase in smokers did not translate into a\ncomparable increase in lung cancer.\n\nThe matter remains unsettled, and the lives of women might be\nsignificantly better if pornography was not around, but so far it has\nproven difficult to justify limiting pornography by way of the harm\nprinciple. It is important to remember that we are currently examining\nthis issue from the perspective of Mill's formulation of the harm\nprinciple and only speech that directly violates rights\nshould be banned. Finding pornography offensive, obscene or outrageous\nis not sufficient grounds for censorship. Nor does Mill's principle\nallow prohibition because pornography harms the viewer. The harm\nprinciple is there to prevent other-regarding not self-regarding harm.\n\nOverall, no one has mounted a compelling case (at least as far as\nlegislators and judges are concerned) for banning pornography (except\nin the case of minors) based on the concept of harm formulated by\nMill.\n2.3 Mill's Harm Principle and Hate Speech\n\nAnother difficult case is hate speech. Most liberal democracies have\nlimitations on hate speech, but it is debatable whether these can be\njustified by the harm principle as formulated by Mill. One would have\nto show that such speech violated rights, directly and in the first\ninstance. I am interested here in hate speech that does not advocate\nviolence against a group or individual because such speech would be\ncaptured by Mill's harm principle. The Public Order Act 1986 in the\nU.K. does not require such a stringent barrier as the harm principle\nto prohibit speech. The Act states that \u201cA person is guilty of\nan offence if he ...displays any writing, sign or other visible\nrepresentation which is threatening, abusive or insulting, within the\nhearing or sight of a person likely to be caused harassment, alarm or\ndistress.\u201d \n\nThere have been several prosecutions in the U.K. that would not have\nhappened if the harm principle governed \u201cabsolutely the dealings\nof society with the individual\u201d(Mill,1978, 68). In 2001\nevangelist Harry Hammond was prosecuted for the following statements:\n\u201cJesus Gives Peace, Jesus is Alive, Stop Immorality, Stop\nHomosexuality, Stop Lesbianism, Jesus is Lord\u201d. For his sins he\nwas fined 300 pounds and made to pay 395 pounds in costs. In 2010,\nHarry Taylor left anti-religious cartoons in the prayer-room of\nLiverpool's John Lennon Airport. The airport chaplain was\n\u201cinsulted, offended, and alarmed\u201d by the cartoons and\ncalled the police. Taylor was prosecuted and received a six-month\nsuspended sentence. Barry Thew wore a t-shirt hours after two women\npolice officers were murdered near Manchester in 2012. The front of\nthe shirt had the slogan \u201cOne less pig, perfect justice,\u201d\nand on the back was written \u201cKill a cop for fun\u201d. He\nadmitted a Section 4A Public Order Offence and was sentenced to 4\nmonths jail. Also in 2012, Liam Stacey took to twitter to mock a black\nprofessional football player who collapsed during a match. He then\nproceeded to racially abuse people who responded negatively to his\ntweet. He was sentenced to 56 days in jail. This case provoked\nsignificant commentary, most of it taking the form of slippery-slope\nclaims that the decision would inevitably lead to Britain becoming a\ntotalitarian state. The most recent (June 2016) case to receive public\nattention involves Paul Gascoigne, the former English football star,\nwho has been charged with racially aggravated abuse after commenting,\nwhilst on stage, that he could only make out a black man standing in a\ndark corner of the room when he smiled. It is doubtful that any of\nthese examples would be captured by Mill's harm principle.\n\nIn Australia, Section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 states\nthat \u201cIt is unlawful for a person to do an act, otherwise than\nin private, If: (a) the act is reasonably likely in all the\ncircumstances to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate another\nperson or group of people, and (b) the act is done because of race,\ncolour or national or ethnic origin\u201d. The most prominent person\nprosecuted under the Act is Andrew Bolt, a conservative political\ncommentator, who was found guilty of racially vilifying nine\naboriginal persons in newspaper articles in 2011. He suggested that\nthe nine people had identified as aboriginal, despite having fair\nskin, for their own professional advantage. The case prompted the Tony\nAbbott led Liberal government into a failed attempt to change the\nlegislation.\n\nIt should be noted that Section 18C is qualified by Section 18D (often\nignored in the backlash against the Bolt decision). 18D says that \n\n\u2026section 18C does not render unlawful anything said or done\nreasonably and in good faith: (a) in the performance, exhibition or\ndistribution of an artistic work; or (b) in the course of any\nstatement, publication, discussion or debate made or held for any\ngenuine academic, artistic or scientific purpose or any other genuine\npurpose in the public interest; or (c) in the making or publishing:\n(i) a fair and accurate report of any event or matter of public\ninterest; or (ii) a fair comment on any matter of public interest if\nthe comment is an expression of a genuine belief held by the person\nmaking the comment\u2026\n\n\nIt is clear that these qualifications remove some of the teeth from\nSection 18C. As long as the statements are made artistically and/or in\ngood faith, for example, they are immune from prosecution. The\nconclusion of the judge in the Bolt case was that none of the Section\n18D exemptions applied in his case. Even with these qualifications in\nplace, however, it seems that the Racial Discrimination Act would\nstill be ruled out by Mill's harm principle which seems to allow\npeople to offend, insult, and humiliate (although perhaps not\nintimidate) regardless of the motivation of the speaker. \n\nThe United States, precisely because it fits most closely with Mill's\nprinciple, is an outlier amongst liberal democracies when it comes to\nhate speech. The most famous example of this is the Nazi march through\nSkokie, Illinois, something that would not be allowed in many other\nliberal democracies. The intention was not to engage in political\nspeech at all, but simply to march through a predominantly Jewish\ncommunity dressed in storm trooper uniforms and wearing swastikas\n(although the Illinois Supreme Court interpreted the wearing of\nswastikas as \u201csymbolic political speech\u201d). It is clear\nthat many people, especially those who lived in Skokie, were outraged\nand offended by the march, but were they harmed? There was no plan to\ncause physical injury and the marchers did not intend to damage\nproperty. \n\nThe main argument for prohibiting the Skokie march, based on\nconsiderations of harm, was that the march would incite a riot, thus\nputting the marchers in danger. The problem with this argument is that\nthe focal point is the potential harm to the speakers and not the harm\ndone to those who are the subject of the hate. To ban speech for this\nreason, i.e., for the good of the speaker, tends to undermine the\nbasic right to free speech in the first place. If we turn our\nattention to members of the local community, we might want to claim\nthat they were psychologically harmed by the march. This is much more\ndifficult to demonstrate than harm to a person's legal rights. It\nseems, therefore, that Mill's argument does not allow for state\nintervention in this case. If we base our defense of speech on Mill's\nprinciple we will have very few prohibitions. It is only when we can\nshow direct harm to rights, which will almost always mean when an\nattack is made against a specific individual or a small group of\npersons, that it is legitimate to impose a sanction. \n\nOne response is to suggest that the harm principle can be defined less\nstringently. Jeremy Waldron (2012) has made a recent attempt to do\nthis. He draws our attention to the visual impact of hate speech\nthrough posters and signs displayed in public. Waldron argues that the\nharm in hate speech (the title of his book) is that it compromises the\ndignity of those under attack. A society where such images proliferate\nmakes life exceedingly difficult for those targeted by hate speech.\nWaldron suggests that the people engaged in hate speech are saying\n\u201c[t]he time for your degradation and your exclusion by the society\nthat presently shelters you is fast approaching\u201d (2012, 96). He\nclaims that prohibiting such messages assures all people that they are\nwelcome members of the community.\n\nWaldron does not want to use hate speech legislation to punish those\nwho hold hateful thoughts and attitudes. The goal is not to engage in\nthought control but to prevent harm to the social standing of certain\ngroups in society. Liberal democratic societies are founded on ideas\nof equality and dignity and these are damaged by hate speech. Given\nthis, Waldron wonders why we even need to debate the usefulness of\nhate speech. Mill, for example, argued that we should allow speech of\nthis type so that our ideas do not fall into the \u201cslumber of a\ndecided opinion\u201d (1978, 41). Waldron doubts that we require hate\nspeech to prevent such an outcome. \n\nAs we have seen, Waldron is making a harm based argument but his\nthreshold for what counts as harm is lower than Mill\u2019s. He needs to\nconvince us that an attack on a person's dignity constitutes a\nsignificant harm. My dignity might often be bruised by colleagues, for\nexample, but this does not necessarily show that I have been harmed.\nPerhaps it is only when an attack on dignity is equivalent to threats\nof physical abuse that it counts as a reason for limiting speech.\nWaldron does not offer a lot of evidence that a permissive attitude to\nhate speech, at least in liberal democracies, does cause significant\nharm. There is no specific hate speech regulation in the United\nStates, for example, but it is not clear that more harm occurs there\nthan in other liberal democracies.\n\nDavid Boonin (2011) is not convinced that there is a need for special\nhate speech legislation. He claims that hate speech does not fit\nwithin the regular categories of speech that can be prohibited. Even\nif he can be persuaded that it does fit, he still thinks special hate\nspeech laws are not required because existing legislation will capture\nthe offending speech. I will examine one example he uses to make his\npoint. Boonin argues that threatening speech already sits within the\ncategory of speech that is rightfully prohibited. He suggests,\nhowever, that hate speech does not fall within this category because a\nsignificant amount of hate speech is not directly threatening. A group\nof black men, for example, will not be threatened by a racially\nabusive elderly white woman. He argues that this example, and others\nlike it, show why a blanket ban on all hate speech on the grounds that\nit is threatening cannot be justified. \n\nNor is it likely, he suggests, that racist attacks by frail old ladies\nwill contribute to an atmosphere of danger. This argument might be\nless persuasive. Mill\u2019s use of the corn dealer example demonstrates\nhow the use of language can incite violence regardless of who is\nspeaking. But Mill\u2019s example also shows that a blanket ban would\nstill be unwarranted because it allows incendiary statements to be\nmade about corn dealers under controlled conditions. \n\nBoonin\u2019s argument does not rest here. If it really does turn out to\nbe the case that all hate speech is threatening in the appropriate\nsense, this still does not justify special hate speech laws because\nthere is already legislation in place prohibiting threatening\nlanguage. Boonin is opposed to banning hate speech because it is\nhateful not because it is threatening. He claims that the argument for\nspecial hate speech laws is \u201cimpaled on the horns of a dilemma:\neither the appeal is unconvincing because not all forms of hate speech\nare threatening, or it is unnecessary precisely because all forms of\nhate speech are threatening and are therefore already prohibited\u201d\n(2011, 213). Boonin uses the same strategy with regard to other\nreasons, such as \u201cfighting words\u201d, for banning hate speech; they all\nfind themselves impaled on the horns of the same dilemma.\n\nThe arguments of Waldron and Boonin seem to be a long way apart and\nthe latter suggests that anyone who argues for hate speech laws is\ntaking an extreme position. There is, however, a lot of overlap\nbetween the two, particularly as both focus on harm, and neither wants\nto censor hate speech simply because it is offensive. This becomes\nclearer if we take a suggestion offered by Waldron. At one point in\nhis book he ponders whether it might be advantageous to abandon the\nterm \u201chate speech\u201d altogether. Such a move goes a long way to\nreconciling the arguments of Waldron and Boonin. Both authors agree\nthat prohibition is acceptable when speech is threatening; they\ndisagree on what counts as a harmful threat. Waldron thinks most forms\nof racial abuse qualify whereas Boonin is more circumspect. But the\ndisagreement between the two is about what causes harm rather than any\nmajor philosophical difference about the appropriate limits on speech.\nIf both agree that a threat constitutes a significant harm, then both\nwill support censorship. This still leaves lots of room for\ndisagreement, particularly as we are now more aware than was Mill of\npsychological as well as physical harm. I cannot delve into the topic\nhere except to say that if we expand the harm principle from the\nphysical to the mental realm, more options might become available for\nprohibiting hate speech and pornography.\n2.4 Responses to the Harm Principle\n\nThere are two basic responses to the harm principle. One is that it is\ntoo narrow; the other is that it is too broad. This latter view is not\noften expressed because, as already noted, most people think that free\nspeech should be limited if it causes illegitimate harm. George Kateb\n(1996), however, has made an interesting argument that runs as\nfollows. If we want to limit speech because it causes harm, we will\nhave to ban a lot of political speech. Most of it is useless, a lot of\nit is offensive, and some of it causes harm because it is deceitful\nand aimed at discrediting specific groups. It also undermines\ndemocratic citizenship and stirs up nationalism and jingoism, which\nresults in harm to citizens of other countries. Even worse than\npolitical speech, according to Kateb, is religious speech. He claims\nthat a lot of religious speech is hateful, useless, dishonest, and\nfoments war, bigotry and fundamentalism. It also creates bad\nself-image and feelings of guilt that can haunt persons throughout\ntheir lives. Pornography and hate speech, he claims, cause nowhere\nnear as much harm as political and religious speech. As we rightly do\nnot want to ban political and religious speech, Kateb claims to have\ndemonstrated that the harm principle casts the net too far. His\nsolution is to abandon the principle in favor of almost unlimited\nspeech.\n\nThis is a powerful argument, but there seem to be at least two\nproblems. The first is that the harm principle would actually allow\nreligious and political speech for the same reasons that it allows\nmost pornography and hate speech, namely that it is not possible to\ndemonstrate that such speech does cause direct harm to rights. I doubt\nthat Mill would support using his arguments about harm to ban\npolitical and religious speech. The second problem for Kateb is that\nif he is right that such speech does cause harm by violating rights,\nwe now have powerful reasons for limiting political and religious\nspeech. If Kateb's argument is sound he has shown that harm is more\nextensive than we might have thought; he has not demonstrated that the\nharm principle is invalid.\n3. The Offense Principle and Free Speech\n3.1 Joel Feinberg's Offense Principle\n\nThe other response to the harm principle is that it does not reach far\nenough. One of the most impressive arguments for this position comes\nfrom Joel Feinberg who suggests that the harm principle cannot\nshoulder all of the work necessary for a principle of free speech. In\nsome instances, Feinberg suggests, we also need an offense\nprinciple that can guide public censure. The basic idea is that\nthe harm principle sets the bar too high and that we can legitimately\nprohibit some forms of expression because they are very offensive.\nOffending is less serious than harming so any penalties imposed should\nnot be severe. As Feinberg notes, this has not always been the case\nand he cites a number of instances in the U.S. where penalties for\n\u201coffensive\u201d acts like sodomy and consensual incest have ranged from\ntwenty years imprisonment to the death penalty. Feinberg's principle\nreads as follows: \u201cit is always a good reason in support of a\nproposed criminal prohibition that it would probably be an effective\nway of preventing serious offense...to persons other than the actor,\nand that it is probably a necessary means to that end...The principle\nasserts, in effect, that the prevention of offensive conduct is\nproperly the state's business\u201d (1985, 1). \n\nSuch a principle is hard to apply because many people take offense as\nthe result of an overly sensitive disposition, or worse, because of\nbigotry and unjustified prejudice. A further difficulty is that some\npeople can be deeply offended by statements that others find mildly\namusing. The furore over the Danish cartoons brings this starkly to\nthe fore. Despite the difficulty of applying a standard of this kind,\nsomething like the offense principle operates widely in liberal\ndemocracies where citizens are penalized for a variety of activities,\nincluding speech, that would escape prosecution under the harm\nprinciple. Wandering around the local shopping mall naked, or engaging\nin sexual acts in public places are two obvious examples. Given the\nspecific nature of this essay, I will not delve into the issue of\noffensive behavior in all its manifestations, and I will limit the\ndiscussion to offensive forms of speech. Feinberg suggests that many\nfactors need to be taken into account when deciding whether speech can\nbe limited by the offense principle. These include the extent,\nduration and social value of the speech, the ease with which it can be\navoided, the motives of the speaker, the number of people offended,\nthe intensity of the offense, and the general interest of the\ncommunity.\n3.2 Pornography and the Offense Principle\n\nHow does the offense principle help us deal with the issue of erotica?\nGiven the above criteria, Feinberg argues that books should never be\nbanned because the offensive material is easy to avoid. If one is\nunaware of the content and should become offended in the course of\nreading the text, the solution is simple-close the book. A similar\nargument would be applied to erotic films. The French film Baise-Moi\nwas in essence banned in Australia in 2002 because of its supposed\noffensive material (it was denied a rating which meant that it could\nnot be shown in cinemas). It would seem, however, that the offense\nprinciple outlined by Feinberg would not permit such prohibition\nbecause it is very easy to avoid being offended by the film. It should\nalso be legal to advertise the film, but some limits could be placed\non the content of the advertisement so that sexually explicit material\nis not placed on billboards in public places (because these are not\neasily avoidable). At first glance it might seem strange to have a\nmore stringent speech code for advertisements than for the thing being\nadvertised; the harm principle would not provide the grounds for such\na distinction, but it is a logical conclusion of the offense\nprinciple.\n\nWhat of pornography i.e. material that is offensive because of its\nextremely violent or degrading content? In this case the offense is\nmore profound: simply knowing that such material exists is enough to\ndeeply offend many people. The difficulty here is that bare knowledge,\ni.e., being offended by knowing that something exists or is taking\nplace, is not as serious as being offended by something that one does\nnot like and that one cannot escape. If we allow that films\nshould be banned because some people are offended, even when they do\nnot have to view them, consistency demands that we allow the\npossibility of prohibiting many forms of expression. A lot of people\nfind strong attacks on religion, or t.v. shows by religious\nfundamentalists deeply offensive. Feinberg argues that even though\nsome forms of pornography are profoundly offensive to many people,\nthey should not be prohibited on these grounds.\n3.3 Hate Speech and the Offense Principle\n\nHate speech causes profound offense. The discomfort caused to the\ntargets of such attacks cannot be shrugged off easily. As with violent\npornography, the offense that is caused by the march through Skokie\ncannot be avoided simply by staying off the streets because offense is\ntaken over the bare knowledge that the march is taking place. As we\nhave seen, however, bare knowledge does not seem sufficient grounds\nfor prohibition. But in respect to some of the other factors regarding\noffensive speech mentioned above, Feinberg suggests that the march\nthrough Skokie does not do very well: the social value of the speech\nseems to be marginal, the number of people offended will be large, and\nit is difficult to see how it is in the interests of the community.\nThese reasons also hold for violent pornography which Feinberg\nsuggests should not be prohibited for reasons of offense.\n\nA key difference, however, is the intensity of the offense; it is\nparticularly acute with hate speech because it is aimed at a\nrelatively small and specific audience. The motivations of the\nspeakers in the Skokie example seemed to be to incite fear and hatred\nand to directly insult members of the community through the use of\nNazi symbols. Nor, according to Feinberg, was there any political\ncontent to the speech. The distinction between violent pornography and\nthe Skokie example of hate speech is that a particular group of people\nwere targeted and the message of hate was paraded in such a way that\nit could not be easily avoided. It is for these reasons that Feinberg\nsuggests hate speech can be limited by the offense principle.\n\nHe also claims that when fighting words are used to provoke people who\nare prevented by law from using a fighting response, the offense is\nprofound enough to allow for prohibition. If pornographers engaged in\nthe same behaviour and paraded through neighborhoods where they were\nlikely to meet great resistance and cause profound offense, they too\nshould be prevented from doing so. It is clear, therefore, that the\ncrucial component of the offense principle is whether the offense can\nbe avoided. Feinberg's principle means that many forms of hate speech\nwill still be allowed if the offense is easily avoidable. It still\nallows Nazis to meet in private places, or even in public ones that\nare easily bypassed. Advertisements for such meetings can be edited\n(because they are less easy to avoid) but should not be banned. It\nseems Feinberg thinks that hate speech does not, in and of itself,\ncause direct harm to the rights of the targeted group (he is not\nclaiming that offence equals harm) and he would be troubled by some of\nthe prohibitions on speech in the U.K. and Australia.\n4. Democracy and Free Speech\n4.1 Democratic Citizenship and Pornography\n\nVery few, if any, liberal democracies are willing to support the\nMillian view that only speech causing direct harm to rights should be\nprohibited. Most support some form of the offense principle. Some\nliberal philosophers are willing to extend the realm of state\ninterference further and argue that hate speech should be banned even\nif it does not cause harm or unavoidable offense. The reason it should\nbe banned is that it is inconsistent with the underlying values of\nliberal democracy to brand some citizens as inferior on the grounds of\nrace, religion, gender or sexual orientation. The same applies to\npornography; it should be prevented because it is incompatible with\ndemocratic citizenship to portray women as submissive sexual objects,\nwho seem to enjoy being violently mistreated. Rae Langton, for\nexample, starts from the liberal premise of equal concern and respect\nand concludes that it is justifiable to remove certain speech\nprotections for pornographers. She avoids basing her argument on harm:\n\u201cIf, for example, there were conclusive evidence linking\npornography to violence, one could simply justify a prohibitive\nstrategy on the basis of the harm principle. However, the prohibitive\narguments advanced in this article do not require empirical premises\nas strong as this\u2026they rely instead on the notion of\nequality\u201d (1990, 313).\n\nWorking within the framework of arguments supplied by Ronald Dworkin,\nwho is opposed to prohibitive measures, she tries to demonstrate that\negalitarian liberals such as Dworkin should support the prohibition of\npornography. She suggests that we have \u201creason to be concerned\nabout pornography, not because it is morally suspect, but because we\ncare about equality and the rights of women\u201d (1990, 311).\nLangton concludes that \u201cwomen as a group have rights against the\nproducers and consumers of pornography, and thereby have rights that\nare trumps against the policy of permitting pornography\u2026the\npermissive policy is in conflict with the principle of equal concern\nand respect, and that women accordingly have rights against it\u201d\n(1990, 346). Because she is not basing her argument on the harm\nprinciple, she does not have to show that women are harmed by\npornography. For the argument to be persuasive, however, one has to\naccept that permitting pornography does mean that women are not\ntreated with equal concern and respect. It also seems that the\nargument can be applied to non-pornagraphic material that portrays\nwomen in a demeaning way that undermines their status as equals. \n4.2 Democratic Citizenship and Hate Speech\n\nTo argue the case above, one has to dilute one's support for freedom\nof expression in favor of other principles, such as equal respect for\nall citizens. This is a sensible approach according to Stanley Fish.\nHe suggests that the task we face is not to arrive at hard and fast\nprinciples that prioritise all speech. Instead, we have to find a\nworkable compromise that gives due weight to a variety of values.\nSupporters of this view will remind us that when we are discussing\nfree speech, we are not dealing with it in isolation; what we are\ndoing is comparing free speech with some other good. We have to decide\nwhether it is better to place a higher value on speech than on the\nvalue of privacy, security, equality, or the prevention of harm.\n\nFish suggests we need to find a balance in which \u201cwe must\nconsider in every case what is at stake and what are the risks and\ngains of alternative courses of action\u201d (1994, 111). Is speech\npromoting or undermining our basic values? \u201cIf you don't ask\nthis question, or some version of it, but just say that speech is\nspeech and that's it, you are mystifying\u2014presenting as an\narbitrary and untheorized fiat\u2014a policy that will seem whimsical\nor worse to those whose interests it harms or dismisses\u201d (1994,\n123).\n\nThe task is not to come up with principles that always favors\nexpression, but rather, to decide what is good speech and what is bad\nspeech. A good policy \u201cwill not assume that the only relevant\nsphere of action is the head and larynx of the individual\nspeaker\u201d (Fish, 1994, 126). Is it more in keeping with the\nvalues of a democratic society, in which every person is deemed equal,\nto allow or prohibit speech that singles out specific individuals and\ngroups as less than equal? Fish's answer is that, \u201cit depends. I\nam not saying that First Amendment principles are inherently bad (they\nare inherently nothing), only that they are not always the appropriate\nreference point for situations involving the production of\nspeech\u201d (1994, 113). But, all things considered, \u201cI am\npersuaded that at the present moment, right now, the risk of not\nattending to hate speech is greater than the risk that by regulating\nit we will deprive ourselves of valuable voices and insights or slide\ndown the slippery slope towards tyranny. This is a judgement for which\nI can offer reasons but no guarantees\u201d (1994, 115). \n\nThese kinds of justification for prohibitions on hate speech suggest\nthat the permissive approach undermines free speech properly\nunderstood. Even if hate speech or pornography does not cause harm (in\nMill's sense) or offense, it has to be limited because it is\nincompatible with democracy iteslf. The argument from democracy\ncontends that political speech is essential not only for the\nlegitimacy of the regime, but for providing an environment where\npeople can develop and exercise their goals, talents, and abilities.\nIf hate speech and pornography curtail the development of such\ncapacities in certain sections of the community, we have an argument,\nbased on reasons used to justify free speech, for prohibition.\n\nAccording to Fish, the boundaries of free speech cannot be set in\nstone by philosophical principles. It is the world of politics that\ndecides what we can and cannot say guided, but not hidebound, by the\nworld of abstract philosophy. Fish suggests that free speech is about\npolitical victories and defeats. The very guidelines for marking off\nprotected from unprotected speech are the result of this battle rather\nthan truths in their own right: \u201cNo such thing as free\n(nonideologically constrained) speech; no such thing as a public forum\npurged of ideological pressures of exclusion\u201d (Fish, 1994, 116).\nSpeech always takes place in an environment of convictions,\nassumptions, and perceptions i.e., within the confines of a structured\nworld. The thing to do, according to Fish, is get out there and argue\nfor one's position.\n\nWe should ask three questions according to Fish: \u201c[g]iven that\nit is speech, what does it do, do we want it to be done, and is more\nto be gained or lost by moving to curtail it?\u201d (1994, 127). He\nsuggests that the answers we arrive at will vary according to the\ncontext. Free speech will be more limited in the military, where the\nunderlying value is hierarchy and authority, than it will be at a\nuniversity where one of the main values is the expression of ideas.\nEven on campus, there will be different levels of appropriate speech.\nSpouting off at the fountain in the centre of campus should be less\nregulated than what a professor can say during a lecture. It might\nwell be acceptable for me to spend an hour of my time explaining to\npassers-by why Manchester United is a great football team but it would\nbe completely inappropriate (and open to censure) to do the same thing\nwhen I am supposed to be giving a lecture on Thomas Hobbes. A campus\nis not simply a \u201cfree speech forum but a workplace where people\nhave contractual obligations, assigned duties, pedagogical and\nadministrative responsibilities\u201d (1994,129). Almost all places\nin which we interact are governed by underlying values and speech will\nhave to fit in with these ideals: \u201c[r]egulation of free speech\nis a defining feature of everyday life\u201d (Fish, 1994,129).\nThinking of speech in this way removes a lot of its mystique. Whether\nwe should ban hate speech is another problem, albeit more serious,\nsimilar to whether we should allow university professors to talk about\nfootball in lectures.\n4.3 Paternalistic Justification for Limiting Speech\n\nAlthough Stanley Fish takes some of the mystique away from the value\nof speech, he still thinks of limitations largely in terms of other-\nregarding consequences. There are arguments, however, that suggest\nspeech can be limited to prevent harm being done to the speaker. The\nargument here is that the agent might not have a full grasp of the\nconsequences of her actions(whether it be speech or some other form of\nbehavior) and hence can be prevented from engaging in the act.\nArguments used in the Skokie case would fit into this category and\nthere is evidence to suggest that watching pornography can cause\npsychological damage the viewer . Most liberals are wary of such\narguments because they take us into the realm of paternalistic\nintervention where it is assumed that the state knows better than the\nindividual what is in his or her best interests.\n\nMill, for example, is an opponent of paternalism generally, but he\ndoes believe there are certain instances when intervention is\nwarranted. He suggests that if a public official is certain that a\nbridge will collapse, he can prevent a person crossing. If, however,\nthere is only a danger that it will collapse the public can be warned\nbut not coerced from crossing. The decision here seems to depend on\nthe likelihood of personal injury; the more certain injury becomes,\nthe more legitimate the intervention. Prohibiting freedom of speech on\nthese grounds is very questionable for liberals in all but extreme\ncases (it was not persuasive in the Skokie case) because it is very\nrare that speech would produce such a clear danger to the\nindividual.\n\nWe have examined some of the options regarding limitations on free\nspeech and one cannot be classed as a liberal if one is willing to\nstray much further into the arena of state intervention than already\ndiscussed. Liberals tend to be united in opposing paternalistic and\nmoralistic justifications for limiting free expression. They hold a\nstrong presumption in favor of individual liberty because, it is\nargued, this is the only way that the autonomy of the individual can\nbe respected. Feinberg suggests that to prohibit speech for reasons\nother than those already mentioned means: \u201c[i]t can be morally\nlegitimate for the state, by means of the criminal law, to prohibit\ncertain types of action that cause neither harm nor offense to any\none, on the grounds that such actions constitute or cause evils of\nother kinds\u201d (1985, 3). Acts can be \u201cevil\u201d if they are\ndangerous to a traditional way of life, because they are immoral, or\nbecause they hinder the perfectibility of the human race. Many\narguments against pornography take the form that such material is\nwrong because of the moral harm it does to the consumer. Liberals\noppose such views because they are not impressed by states trying to\nmold the moral character of citizens.\n5. Back to the Harm Principle\n\nWe began this examination of free speech with the harm principle; let\nus end with it. The principle suggests that we need to distinguish\nbetween legal sanction and social disapprobation as means of limiting\nspeech. As already noted, the latter does not ban speech but it makes\nit more uncomfortable to utter unpopular statements. Mill does not\nseem to support the imposition of legal penalties unless they are\nsanctioned by the harm principle. As one would expect, he also seems\nto be worried by the use of social pressure as a means of limiting\nspeech. Chapter III of On Liberty is an incredible assault on\nsocial censorship, expressed through the tyranny of the majority,\nbecause he claims it produces stunted, pinched, hidebound and withered\nindividuals: \u201ceveryone lives as under the eye of a hostile and\ndreaded censorship\u2026[i]t does not occur to them to have any\ninclination except what is customary\u201d (1978, 58). He\ncontinues:\n\nthe general tendency of things throughout the world is to render\nmediocrity the ascendant power among mankind\u2026at present\nindividuals are lost in the crowd\u2026the only power deserving the\nname is that of masses\u2026[i]t does seem, however, that when the\nopinions of masses of merely average men are everywhere become or\nbecoming the dominant power, the counterpoise and corrective to that\ntendency would be the more and more pronounced individuality of those\nwho stand on the higher eminences of thought. (1978, 63\u20134)\n\n\nWith these comments, and many others, Mill demonstrates his distaste\nof the apathetic, fickle, tedious, frightened and dangerous majority.\nIt is quite a surprise, therefore, to find that he also seems to\nembrace a fairly encompassing offense principle when the sanction does\ninvolve social disapprobation:\n\nAgain, there are many acts which, being directly injurious\nonly to the agents themselves, ought not to be legally interdicted,\nbut which, if done publicly, are a violation of good manners and,\ncoming thus within the category of offenses against others,\nmay rightly be prohibited. (1978, 97 author's emphasis)\n\n\nSimilarly, he states that \u201cThe liberty of the individual must be\nthus far limited; he must not make himself a nuisance\u201d (1978,\n53). In the latter parts of On Liberty Mill also suggests\nthat distasteful people can be held in contempt, that we can avoid\nthem(as long as we do not parade it), that we can warn others about\nthem, and that we can persuade, cajole and remonstrate with those we\ndeem offensive. These actions are legitimate as the free expression of\nanyone who happens to be offended as long as they are done as a\nspontaneous response to the person's faults and not as a form of\npunishment.\n\nBut those who exhibit cruelty, malice, envy, insincerity, resentment\nand crass egoism are open to the greater sanction of disapprobation as\na form of punishment, because these faults are wicked and\nother-regarding. It may be true that these faults have an impact on\nothers, but it is difficult to see how acting according to malice,envy\nor resentment necessarily violates the rights of others. The\nonly way that Mill can make such claims is to incorporate an offense\nprinciple and hence give up on the harm principle as the only\nlegitimate grounds for interference with behavior. Overall, Mill's\narguments about ostracism and disapprobation seem to provide little\nprotection for the individual who may have spoken in a non-harmful\nmanner but who has nevertheless offended the sensibilities of the\nmasses.\n\nHence we see that one of the great defenders of the harm principle\nseems to shy away from it at certain crucial points; even Mill was\nunable to mount a defense of free speech on this \u201cone simple\nprinciple\u201d alone. It does, however, remain a crucial part of the\nliberal defense of individual freedom. \n6. Conclusion\n\nLiberals tend to justify freedom generally, and free speech in\nparticular, for a variety of reasons. According to Mill, free speech\nfosters authenticity, genius, creativity, individuality and human\nflourishing. He tells us that if we ban speech the silenced opinion\nmay be true, or contain a portion of the truth, and that unchallenged\nopinions become mere prejudices and dead dogmas that are inherited\nrather than adopted. These are empirical claims that require evidence.\nIs it likely that we enhance the cause of truth by allowing hate\nspeech or violent and degrading forms of pornography? It is worth\npondering the relationship between speech and truth. If we had a graph\nwhere one axis is truth and the other is free speech, would we get one\nextra unit of truth for every extra unit of free speech? How can such\na thing even be measured? It is certainly questionable whether\narguments degenerate into prejudice if they are not constantly\nchallenged. Devil's advocates are often tedious rather than useful\ninterlocutors. Sometimes supporters of free speech, like its\ndetractors, have a tendency to make assertions without providing\ncompelling evidence to back them up. None of this is meant to suggest\nthat free speech is not vitally important: this is, in fact, precisely\nthe reason we need to find arguments in its favour. But regardless of\nhow good these arguments are, some limits will have to be placed on\nspeech. \n\nWe have found that the harm principle provides reasons\nfor limiting free speech when doing so prevents direct harm to rights.\nThis means that very few speech acts should be prohibited. It might be\npossible to broaden the scope of this principle, as Waldron attempts\nto do, to include things other than harmful rights violations.\nFeinberg's version of the offense principle has a wider reach than the\nharm principle, but it still recommends very limited intervention in\nthe realm of free speech. All forms of speech that are found to be\noffensive but easily avoidable should go unpunished. This means that\nmuch pornography and hate speech will escape censure.\n\nIf these arguments are acceptable, it seems reasonable to extend them\nto other forms of behavior. Public nudity, for example, does not cause\nserious harm and if it does offend some people it is at most a bit\nembarrassing, and is avoided by averting one's eyes. The same goes\nwith nudity, sex, and coarse language on television. Turning off the\ntelevision provides instant relief from the offense. Neither the harm\nor the offense principles as outlined by Mill and Feinberg support\ncriminalizing most drug use, nor the enforcement of seat belts, crash\nhelmets and the like.\n\nSome argue that speech can be limited for the sake of other liberal\nvalues, particularly the concern for democratic equality. This\nargument, unlike those based on harm and offense, has the potential to\nallow significant limits on pornography and hate speech. The claim is\nnot that speech should always lose out when it clashes with equality,\nbut it certainly should not be automatically privileged. To extend\nprohibitions on speech and other actions beyond this point requires an\nargument for a form of legal paternalism that suggests the state can\ndecide what is acceptable for the safety and moral instruction of\ncitizens, even if it means limiting actions that do not cause harm or\nunavoidable offense and which do not undermine democratic equality.\n\n\nIt has certainly been the practice of most societies, even\nliberal-democratic ones, to impose some paternalistic restrictions on\nbehavior and to limit speech that causes avoidable offense. Hence the\nfreedom of expression supported by the harm principle as outlined in\nChapter One of On Liberty and by Feinberg's offense principle\nhas yet to be realised. It is up to the reader to decide if such a\nsociety is an appealing possibility.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Abel, R., 1998. <em>Speaking Respect, Respecting Speech</em>,\nChicago: University of Chicago Press.", "Abrams, F., 2006. <em>Speaking Freely: Trials of the First\nAmendment</em>, London: Penguin", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2017. <em>The Soul of the First\nAmendment</em>, New Haven: Yale University Press", "Alexander, L. and Horton, P., 1984. \u201cThe Impossibility of a Free\nSpeech Principle\u201d <em>Northwestern Law Review</em>,\n78(5): 1319ff.", "Alexander, L., 2005. <em>Is There a Right to Freedom of\nExpression?</em>, Cambridge: Cambridge Studies in Philosophy and\nLaw.", "Allen, D., 1995. <em>Freeing the first Amendment: Critical\nPerspectives on Freedom of Expression</em>, New York: New York\nUniversity Press.", "Anderson, E., 1991. \u201cJ.S.
