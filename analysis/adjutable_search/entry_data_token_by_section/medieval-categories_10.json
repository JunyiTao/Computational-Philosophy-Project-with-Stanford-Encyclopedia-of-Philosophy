    "main_text": "Silver Age of Scholasticism\n6. Silver Age of Scholasticism\n\n\nFrom about 1350 to about 1450, scholastic thought was in retreat. At\nleast two factors seem to have contributed to this\nsituation: first, the epidemic known as the Black Death decimated the\nuniversities of medieval Europe, where scholastic thought had\nflourished in the thirteenth century; second, the Italian Renaissance\nbegan moving forward at high speed with its emphasis on the discovery\nof the ancients and its rejection of \u201cthe age in the\nmiddle.\u201d However, after the middle of the fifteenth century,\nparticularly following the integration of the Iberian peninsula at the\nend of the century and the consolidation of the Spanish Empire, there\nwas a resurgence of scholasticism in the Iberian and Italian\npeninsulas. The Counter Reformation, a movement within the Catholic\nChurch intended to meet the challenge of the Reformation, also\ncontributed substantially to the rebirth of scholastic thought. Among\nthe great leaders of this movement were the Italian Thomas de Vio, also\nknown as Cajetan (1468\u20131534), and the Spaniard Francis Su\u00e1rez.\nBoth had enormous influence on all subsequent\nscholastics and scholastically-inspired thought. Indeed,\nSu\u00e1rez's Metaphysical Disputations (1597) became\nthe standard textbook of metaphysics in Europe and\nLatin America for one hundred and fifty years after its publication,\nwhich means that what he has to say about categories is important for\nunderstanding late scholastic category theory and the discussions of\nthe categories in Early Modern philosophy. Apart from questions of\noriginality, Su\u00e1rez is historically important because he was a\nbridge for metaphysical thought between the Middle Ages and the Modern\nperiod.\n",
