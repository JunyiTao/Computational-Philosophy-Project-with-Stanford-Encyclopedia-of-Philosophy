    "main_text": "Philosophy || Ethics and Practical Philosophy\n2.2 Ethics and Practical Philosophy\n\nThat Royce\u2019s metaphysical solution to the problem of error was\nof broad relevance for the rest of his philosophy is clear: \u201cThe\nexistence of error\u2026must be explained as due to the same\nconditions as those which make possible finite life, evil,\nindividuality, and conflict in general\u201d (Robinson 123). Error is\npossible, according to Royce, only if there is an infinite being for\nwhich all intended objects could be realized. This Being (whether\nconceived as Absolute Mind or the infinite Community of\nInterpretation) also makes individual human life comprehensible.\nRoyce\u2019s considerable attention to speculative metaphysics is\ncomplemented by his concern for the practical implications of that\nmetaphysics. The infinite manifests itself in the realm of individual\nbeings bound within the finite constraints of time and space. Ethics\nand religion have their basis in this relation of the individual to\nthe infinite real world, a relation Royce characterized in terms of\nloyalty.\n2.2.1 The Philosophy of Loyalty\n\nNear the end of The Philosophy of Loyalty Royce wrote:\n\nHuman life taken merely as it flows, viewed merely as it passes by in\ntime and is gone, is indeed a lost river of experience that plunges\ndown the mountains of youth and sinks in the deserts of age. Its\nsignificance comes solely through its relations to the air and the\nocean and the great deeps of universal experience. For by such poor\nfigures I may, in passing, symbolize that really rational relation of\nour personal experience to universal conscious\nexperience\u2026.(Royce 1908 [1995, 179\u201380])\n\n\nRoyce\u2019s ethics is rooted in his analysis of the conditions\nnecessary for an individual life to be meaningful. It is not enough\nthat one\u2019s actions merely conform to the strictures of\nconventional morality \u2014 a trained animal might well fulfill such\nminimal conditions of morality. To lead a morally significant life,\none\u2019s actions must express a self-consciously asserted will.\nThey must contribute toward realizing a plan of life, a plan that is\nitself unified by some freely chosen aim. Such an aim and its\ncorresponding plan of life could not easily be created by an\nindividual out of the chaos of conflicting personal desires and\nimpulses that we all encounter. Rather, such aims and plans are found\nalready largely formed in social experience: we come to consciousness\nin a world that proffers countless well-defined causes and programs\nfor their accomplishment. These programs extend through time and\nrequire the contributions of many individuals for their advancement.\nWhen one judges a cause to be worthwhile and freely embraces such a\nprogram, several momentous things happen. The individual\u2019s will\nis focused and defined in terms of the shared cause. The individual\nbecomes allied with a community of others who are also committed to\nthe same cause. Finally, a morally significant commitment to the cause\nand to the community develops. This commitment is what Royce calls\n\u201cloyalty.\u201d The moral life may be understood in terms of\nthe multiple loyalties that a person exhibits.\n\nJust as the truth value of an idea is a matter of whether its intended\nobject is fulfilled in reality, the moral value of actions is a matter\nof whether they are loyal, whether they tend to fulfill the\ncommunity\u2019s intended aim. Loyalty is a necessary condition for\nmoral validity; defined narrowly, as Royce preferred, loyalty may even\nbe a sufficient condition for moral validity. Royce\u2019s narrow\ndefinition of loyalty, of \u201ctrue loyalty,\u201d is intended to\nrule out loyalty to morally evil causes and the communities that serve\nthem. Royce observed that the highest moral achievements throughout\nhistory have involved individuals\u2019 loyalty to ideals that\npromote the formation and expansion of communities of loyalty. Many of\nthe worst deeds have also involved a high degree of loyalty, but this\nloyalty is directed exclusively to a particular group and is expressed\nin the destruction of the conditions for others\u2019 loyal actions,\nof those other persons, and even of one\u2019s own community and\ncause. Royce generalized the difference between true loyalty and\nvicious or \u201cpredatory\u201d loyalty as follows:\n\na cause is good, not only for me, but for mankind, in so far as it is\nessentially a loyalty to loyalty, that is, an aid and a\nfurtherance of loyalty in my fellows. It is an evil cause in so far\nas, despite the loyalty that it arouses in me, it is destructive of\nloyalty in the world of my fellows. (Royce 1908 [1995, 56])\n\n\nWhile every community hopes for the accomplishment of its central\ncause, and sees that cause\u2019s fulfillment as its highest\nachievement, Royce placed particularly high emphasis on the phenomenon\nof loyalty to a lost cause. A lost cause is not in Royce\u2019s view\na hopeless cause, but rather one that cannot be fulfilled within the\nactual lifetime of the community or any of its members. Many lost\ncauses are rightly lost, of course, and there is a problematic aspect\nto Royce\u2019s use of this term. Royce\u2019s contemporaries would have\nunderstood \u201cthe lost cause\u201d as a reference to \u201cthe mythology of\npre-Civil War southern society,\u201d a romanticized view of the\nConfederate States\u2019 defense of slavery and segregation in the\nU.S. Civil War (Fischer 2012, 32). Royce identified military action as\nan example of predatory loyalty, however, so his veiled reference to\nthe lost cause of the Confederacy is a very poor example of loyalty.\nBesides such misguided \u201cevil causes,\u201d though, there are a number of\nlegitimate causes that are, by this definition, \u201clost\u201d\nsimply in virtue of their scope and magnitude. Such causes are not\nhopeless, however. It is precisely these causes that establish ideals\ncapable of evoking our highest hope and moral commitment.\n\nChief among these are the universal causes of the full attainment of\ntruth, the complete determination of the nature of reality through\ninquiry and interpretation, and of the establishment of universal\nloyalty to loyalty itself. In practice, the formula of \u201cloyalty\nto loyalty\u201d demands that one\u2019s moral and intellectual\nsphere become ever broader and remain critical at all levels. All the\ncommunities we actually know, those we inhabit and identify with, are\nfinite and to some degree \u201cpredatory\u201d in Royce\u2019s\nsense. This is clearly true of small social cliques, isolated\nintellectual communities, parochial religious groups, self-interested\nunions and corporations, local political movements, and other such\ngroups. Roycean loyalty requires one to scrutinze the aims and actions\nof such communities and to work to reform their disloyal aspects. The\nphilosophy of loyalty calls us first of all, then, to create and\nembrace more cosmopolitan and inclusionary communities. It should be\nclear that this is only the first important step of an infinite\nprocess aimed at realizing the ideal of universal loyalty. Any actual\ncommunity, whether it be the United Nations or a bickering family,\nwill in fact fall short of perfect loyalty. When it does so, each must\nanswer to the same critical scrutiny and calls for reform. There is no\nexpectation that these high ideals of perfect loyalty, truth and\nreality will ever be fully realized. These \u201clost causes\u201d\nare indispensable, in Royce\u2019s view, as the source of absolute\nnorms for any community and its members.\n\nRoyce maintained that the logic of volition, pursued far enough,\ncompels us to embrace precisely these lost causes as our own. In the\ncourse of his extended debate with James over the adequacy of\npragmatism as a doctrine, Royce came to accept many of James\u2019s\nprinciples. One, inspired by James\u2019s well-known essay \u201cThe\nWill to Believe,\u201d is that any philosophical view is at bottom an\nexpression of individual volition. Given the fact of our existence in\nthe world, we must first decide how we are to approach that world, and\nthen develop our philosophical theories accordingly. A second\nprinciple that Royce adopted is the pragmatist view of truth: truth is\nthe property possessed by those ideas that succeed in the long run.\nRoyce\u2019s main disagreements with other versons of pragmatism\nconcern the way these two principles are typically understood. Royce\nmaintained that although there are several possible attitudes of the\nwill that one might adopt toward the world (including\nSchopenhauer\u2019s \u201cwill to live\u201d and its opposite,\nresignation) only one \u2014 loyalty to the ideal of an ultimate\ntruth \u2014 is correct. The other possible attitudes of the will are\nself-refuting. He accordingly referred to his own position as\n\u201cAbsolute Voluntarism\u201d (Royce 1913 [2001, 349]). Royce\noffered a similar argument concerning the pragmatist notion of truth\n(Royce 1913 [2001, 279]). Explicitly adopting one of Peirce\u2019s\nconcepts, Royce argues that to define truth using any conception of\n\u201cthe long run\u201d \u2014 short of the ideal end of inquiry\n\u2014 is self-refuting. Given the apparent finality of this argument\n(which is, again, a variation of the Argument from Error) Royce called\nhis position \u201cAbsolute Pragmatism.\u201d\n\nRoyce\u2019s philosophy of loyalty resembles existentialism in\ncertain respects. Notable among these are the notions that we come to\nmoral awareness in a world of already established aims and social\nprojects, that moral responsibility requires a self-conscious and\ndeliberate individual choice to embrace particular causes, and that\nthe highest forms of ethical conduct involve dedication and effort in\nservice of a cause that offers no promise of final success. Royce\ndiffers from later existentialists such as Camus and Sartre, however,\nin several important respects. Royce would not accept their notion\nthat human efforts are finally absurd, unfolding against a backdrop of\na meaningless and indifferent universe. On the contrary, Royce\nmaintained that the concepts of ultimate meaning and reality are\npowerful and legitimate forces in our lives. With existentialism,\nRoyce recognized the very real chasms that separate one person\u2019s\nfeelings, thoughts, and will from another: the experience of another\nmay be inscrutable. At the same time, though, he insisted that we\nacknowledge the equally important fact that in ordinary social life\nminds frequently do work in concert. Groups of people often are\nunified in feeling, thought, and will by something that transcends any\nof the individuals present (Royce 1913 [2001, 239]).\n2.2.2 Theory of Community\n\nRoyce was one of the first American philosophers to recognize the\nimportant challenge of Nietzsche\u2019s moral vision, which\ncelebrates those individuals who seek to exercise their autonomous\nwill to a \u201csocially idealized\u201d power. Such heroic\nindividualism, also associated with Walt Whitman, Ralph Waldo Emerson,\nand William James, proves unsatisfactory in Royce\u2019s view (Royce\n1908 [1995, 41]). Their inspiring ethical visions are doomed to\nineffectiveness precisely because of their extreme individualism.\n\u201cThere is only one way to be an ethical individual. That is to\nchoose your cause, and then to serve it, as the Samurai his feudal\nchief, as the ideal knight of romantic story his lady, \u2014 in the\nspirit of all the loyal\u201d (Royce 1908 [1995, 47]). These\nparticular examples are meant to illustrate the essentially social\ncharacter of loyalty in general: \u201cMy life means nothing, either\ntheoretically or practically, unless I am a member of a\ncommunity\u201d (Royce 1913 [2001, 357]).\n\nOne of the more striking features of Royce\u2019s philosophy is its\nemphasis on communities as being logically prior to individuals. As we\nhave seen, Royce considered the notions of truth and knowledge\nunintelligible for the individual unless we posit an ultimate knower\nof objective truth, the infinite community of minds. The notions of\npersonal identity and purpose are likewise unintelligible unless we\nposit a community of persons that defines causes and establishes\nsocial roles for those individuals to embrace. The concept of\ncommunity is thus central both to Royce\u2019s ethics and his\nmetaphysics. Not just any association or collection of individuals is\na community. Community can only exist where individual members are in\ncommunication with one another so that there is, to some extent and in\nsome relevant respect, a congruence of feeling, thought, and will\namong them. It is also necessary to consider the temporal dimensions\nof community. \u201cA community constituted by the fact that each of\nits members accepts as a part of his own individual life and self the\nsame past events that each of his fellow-members accepts, may\nbe called a community of memory.\u201d Similarly, \u201cA\ncommunity constituted by the fact that each of its members accepts, as\npart of his own individual life and self, the same expected\nfuture events that each of his fellows accepts, may be called\na community of expectation or\u2026a community of\nhope\u201d (PC 248). These common past and future events, which\nall members hold as identical parts of their own lives, are the basis\nof their loyalty to the community.\n\nAs discussed in connection with Royce\u2019s ethical theory, some\ncommunities are defined by true loyalty, or adherence to a cause that\nharmonizes with the universal ideal of \u201cloyalty to\nloyalty.\u201d He referred to such communities as \u201cgenuine\ncommunities\u201d or \u201ccommunities of grace.\u201d Other\ncommunities are defined by a vicious or predatory loyalty. These\ndegenerate \u201cnatural communities\u201d tend toward the\ndestruction of others\u2019 causes and possibilities of loyalty.\nFinally, beyond the actual communities that we directly encounter in\nlife there is the ideal \u201cBeloved Community\u201d of all those\nwho would be fully dedicated to the cause of loyalty, truth and\nreality itself.\n\nRoyce stressed that the sharing of individuals\u2019 feelings,\nthoughts, and wills that occurs in any community (including the\nBeloved Community) should not be taken to imply a mystical blurring or\nannihilation of personal identities. Individuals remain individuals,\nbut in forming a community they attain to a kind of second-order life\nthat extends beyond any of their individual lives. Where a number of\nindividuals\u2019 loyalty to a cause is coordinated in community over\ntime, Royce spoke non-figuratively of a super-human personality at\nwork: a genuine community is united by a guiding or\n\u201cinterpreting spirit.\u201d The interpreting spirit may on\noccasion be embodied by a single person such as a leader or other\nexemplar, but this is not always the case.\n",
