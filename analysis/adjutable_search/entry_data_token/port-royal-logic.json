It was one of the most influential\npieces of philosophy written in the early modern period. This\ninfluence took two main forms. It was in many ways the most widely\nread text in formal logic from Aristotle to the end of the nineteenth\ncentury. It emphasized general principles of careful thinking over the\nmemorization of complicated formal rules found in traditional texts.\nThe result is a relatively compact work written in vernacular instead\nof the imposing Latin tomes otherwise available. Its readability is\nenhanced by long digressions devoted to moralizing and to recent\nadvances in scientific understanding. As a result serious readers,\n\u201ccan read and understand in seven or eight days\u201d, or so\nthe authors claim (Logic, 13). It also served as a kind of\nhandbook of some basic aspects of Cartesian and post-Cartesian science\nand philosophy.\n\nThe authors were Antoine Arnauld and Pierre Nicole, philosophers and\ntheologians associated with the Port-Royal Abbey, a center of the\nheretical Catholic Jansenist movement in seventeenth-century France.\nThe first edition appeared in 1662; during the authors\u2019\nlifetimes four major revisions were published, the last and most\nimportant in 1683. The 1981 critical edition by Pierre Clair and\nFran\u00e7ois Girbal lists 63 French editions and 10 English\neditions (the 1818 English edition served as a text at the\nUniversities of Cambridge and Oxford). The work treats topics in what\nare now regarded as the theory of knowledge, metaphysics, philosophy\nof language, grammar, philosophical logic, and both formal and\ninformal logic. The Logic is a companion to General and\nRational Grammar: The Port-Royal Grammar, written primarily by\nArnauld and \u201cedited\u201d by Claude Lancelot, which had\npreviously appeared in 1660.\n\nSection 1 of this article briefly explains Arnauld\u2019s connection\nto the Port-Royal Abbey and the Jansenist movement. This is important\nbackground for understanding the outlook Logic adopts toward\nits subject matter. For the same reason, general aspects of the\nLogic\u2019s relationship of Cartesian philosophy are\nreviewed in Section 2. An overview of the work\u2019s four part\nstructure follows in Section 3.

Antoine Arnauld, Jansenism, and the Port-Royal Abbey\n\nAntoine Arnauld, the primary author of the Logic, was born in\nParis, on 8 February 1612, to Antoine and Catherine Arnauld. His\nfather was one of the most famous lawyers of his time. The son\nAntoine, the youngest of their 20 children, originally wanted to study\nlaw, but because his father had died in 1619, he decided to honor his\nmother\u2019s wish that he study theology. He entered the Sorbonne,\nbecoming a disciple of Lescot, the confessor of Cardinal Richelieu. In\naddition to the Port-Royal Grammar and the Logic,\nArnauld is best known as the author of the Fourth Objections to\nDescartes\u2019 Meditations. He also engaged in lengthy\ncorrespondence with Leibniz, carried on a polemic against Malebranche\nin the Treatise on True and False Ideas, and wrote several\ntheological essays, including The Perpetuity of the Faith.\nPierre Nicole, the secondary author, was born at Chartres in 1625. His\nfather was also a prominent lawyer, with ties to literary circles in\nParis. Nicole studied theology at the Sorbonne, where he came into\ncontact with teachers inclined towards Jansenism. When Jansenism came\nunder attack at the Sorbonne, he withdrew and went to the abbey at\nPort-Royal-des-Champs. He eventually became one of the most prominent\nJansenist writers of the seventeenth century; his Moral\nEssays (1671\u20137) was at that time his most famous work.\n\nJansenism was a radical reform movement within French Catholicism\nbased on Augustine\u2019s views of the relation between free will and\nthe efficacy of grace. The movement was named after Cornelis Jansen\n(or Cornelius Jansenius), a Dutch theologian born in 1585 who studied\nat the Sorbonne. He became the Bishop of Ypres in the Spanish\nNetherlands in 1636 and died two years later. His major work\nAugustinus was published posthumously in 1640. A second\nfigure in Jansenism was the Abbot of Saint-Cyran, born Jean Duvergier\nde Hauranne in 1581. He received his M.A. in theology at the Sorbonne\nin 1600, where he met Jansen. The two worked together from\n1611\u20131617 on scriptural questions. The issues bringing Jansenism\ninto conflict with Catholic orthodoxy concerned the efficacy of grace,\nthe role of free will in salvation, and the nature of penitence. The\nattack on Jansen began with Isaac Habert\u2019s sermons and writings\nduring 1643\u201344. By 1653 Pope Innocent X issued an encyclical,\nCum occasione, declaring five propositions in\nAugustinus to be heretical. They expressed the views that a\njust person who wishes to obey God\u2019s commandments cannot do so\nwithout the necessary grace to carry them out; that in the state of\ncorrupt nature one can never resist interior grace; and that\nmeritorious actions require only a liberty exempt from constraint\nrather than one exempt from necessity.\n\nAlthough he did not agree with all of Jansen\u2019s views on grace\nand free will, Arnauld devoted several major works to defending\naspects of Jansenism, including On Frequent Communion, the\nDefense of Monsieur Jansenius and a Second Defense.\nThese writings resulted in a trial and his expulsion from the Sorbonne\nin 1656. In 1661 the Council of State decreed that all churchmen must\nsign a formulary drawn up in 1657, condemning the heretical\npropositions in Jansen\u2019s work Augustinus. Arnauld and\nNicole had taken the position that the propositions were heretical but\ndid not appear in the Augustinus. From 1669 to the late 1670s\nthere was a truce between the Catholic Church and the Jansenists. But\nin 1679, after attacks had resumed, Arnauld went into exile in the\nNetherlands; he died at Brussels on 8 August 1694. Nicole had joined\nArnauld in exile, but he returned to Paris in 1683 where he reconciled\nwith the authorities. He died in Paris in 1695.\n2. The Cartesian Background\n\nAlthough Augustine shaped the theology of Jansenism, Ren\u00e9\nDescartes\u2019 influence predominates in the philosophical aspects\nof the Logic. Arnauld\u2019s insightful and respectful set\nof \u201cObjections\u201d to Descartes\u2019 Meditations\nalong with Descartes\u2019 \u201cReplies\u201d were first published\nin 1641 (see Descartes 1984 for English translation, abbreviated CSM).\nThis exchange confirmed Arnauld in his belief that Descartes\u2019\nsystem of philosophy was very well suited to furthering his own\nversion of the Port-Royal theological program. He was impressed by\nDescartes\u2019 frequent insistence that natural science,\nmetaphysical speculation, and even mathematics and logic were to be\nsubordinated to ethical and religious ends (Lachterman 1989, Jones\n2006). Especially important was Descartes\u2019 project of\ndemonstrating that the foundations of natural science are compatible\nwith, and in fact depend on God. The dualism of mental and corporeal\ncreated substances made it possible to conceive the natural world\nmechanically without recourse to any of the additional quasi-spiritual\nentities posited by Aristotelians. Geometrically construed matter\nrequires only God\u2019s creative activity to be the subject matter\nof Cartesian physics. The Logic\u2019s introductory\n\u201cFirst Discourse\u201d announces the intention to choose\nexamples throughout the book that promote both correct religious\nmorality and the best (i.e., Cartesian) science. Examples of how\nreason favors Cartesian science over its competitors are accordingly\nsprinkled throughout the Logic.\n\nThe resources of Cartesian philosophy for repudiating skepticism also\nappealed to Arnauld. Cartesian knowledge is grounded in clear and\ndistinct perceptions of reason alone. Truths delivered by reason alone\ncannot be doubted unless they are not clear and distinct and thus\n\u201cconfused\u201d in Descartes\u2019 terminology. For Descartes\nand Arnauld this means that skeptical denials of fundamental truths\nare merely verbal (Logic, First Discourse 7; also see Lennon\n2008: 62\u201377). The soul surrenders to the truth whenever it is\nstrongly penetrated by it just as eyes see whenever they are open and\nstruck by sunlight (Logic, First Discourse, 8). For example,\none who affirms that \u201cIt is doubtful that God exists\u201d must\nfail to clearly and distinctly perceive God. The Logic sets\nitself against Montaigne and Pyrrhonian skepticism in particular, but\nalso takes frequent opportunities to undercut skeptical threats from\nmaterialism and irreligion. Elsewhere, Arnauld wanted to emphasize\nalong with Descartes himself that the latter\u2019s \u201cmethod of\ndoubt\u201d as presented in the Meditations \u201cshould be\nstudied only by very intelligent and well-educated readers\u201d\n(Replies to fourth set of objections [CSM II, 172]). This restriction\nwas meant to avoid encouraging the very doubts that Descartes\nintroduces as part of the specialized method for attaining certain\nknowledge.\n\nEven more important for the Logic is Descartes\u2019\nattitude toward formal logic. In his early, incomplete Rules for\nthe Direction of the Native Intellect (c. 1628) and the\nwell-known Discourse on Method (1637), Descartes eschewed\ntraditional logic in favor of techniques for acquiring knowledge in\nthe first place. Syllogisms rarely accomplish that; they serve instead\nas a means of presenting what is already known. His view of deductive\ninference was accordingly based on his theory of the mind\u2019s\nperceptions. From our contemporary perspective, it could be said that\nDescartes\u2019 philosophical system replaced formal logic with\nepistemology and the philosophy of mind. The Logic does\ndevote considerable space to a treatment of formal techniques, but the\nreader is repeatedly reminded that this is of secondary importance.\nThe full title of the book is Logic, or the Art of Thinking,\nnot the art of reasoning or the art of inferring. The book also\ncontains a wealth of examples meant to illustrate moral and religious\nnorms and\n\n\n\u2026almost as much metaphysics as one ought to know, although we\ndo not claim not to have borrowed from anyone. (Logic, First\nDiscourse, 12)\n\n\nBecause the Logic\u2019s digressions into the non-logical\nterritories of natural science and religion are often lengthy, they\ninfluence the character of the book. The authors claim that these\nfeatures add to the book\u2019s readability and that they are\nconcrete applications of its general lessons to present knowledge\nabout actual things.\n3. Overview of the Structure of the Port-Royal Logic\n\nThe text of the Logic is organized around the four mental\noperations important to the \u201cart of thinking\u201d:\nconceiving ideas, affirming and denying propositions\n(judging), affirming and denying propositions on the basis of\nother propositions (reasoning, i.e., inferring), and\nordering results of good reasoning. Logic is the sequential\napplication of these operations. Conceiving ideas is the \u201cfirst\naction\u201d of the mind, propositions are formed from ideas, and\nreasoning involves propositions. Ordering these products of thought\nconstitutes method. This organization reflects the point that\nlogic is taken to be primarily a science of the activity of thinking\nin the pursuit of knowledge. This framework for understanding logic is\nnow regarded as \u201cpsychologistic\u201d in opposition to both\nearlier and post-Fregean approaches that focus on methods for dealing\nwith formal aspects of reasoning.\n\nIntroductory material to the final (1683) edition includes a Preface\n(added 1683), a Foreword and First Discourse (1662), and a Second\nDiscourse (added 1664). The First Discourse lays out the plan of the\nLogic, explaining that its main purpose is to educate\njudgment to make it more precise. This is seen as instrumental for\nmaking the speculative sciences more useful. Thus the Logic\ncontains not only a treatment of correct reasoning, but also examples\nof how reasoning can go wrong. The Second Discourse offers a reply to\nobjections made to the first edition. The main point is to justify the\ncritical treatment of Aristotle on the ground that knowing how a great\nmind can err can help others avoid making the same mistakes. But it\nalso takes pains to point out that the Logic owes some things\nto Aristotle\u2019s Analytics and other works. The main text\nthat then follows is about the four mental operations with one Part\ndevoted to each.\n\nPart I on ideas consists of 15 chapters devoted to five topics: the\nnature and origin of ideas (chapter 1); the objects ideas represent\n(chapters 2\u20134); simple versus compound ideas (chapter 5); the\nlogical analysis of universal, particular, and singular ideas and the\nextension and comprehension of terms (chapters 6\u20138); and clear\nand distinct versus obscure and confused ideas, including a discussion\nof types of definition (chapters 9\u201315).\n\nPart II on judgment consists of 20 chapters. Recognizing that the mind\nclosely links ideas with the words that express them, their discussion\nbegins with an analysis of parts of speech in chapters 1 and 2.\nChapters 3 and 4 present a version of the Aristotelian theory of\ncategorical proposition and the square of opposition. Chapters\n5\u201314 treat the properties of simple, compound, and complex\npropositions, including how to identify and classify them. This\nsection contains the famous distinction between restrictive\n(\u201cdeterminative\u201d) and non-restrictive\n(\u201cexplicative\u201d) subordinate clauses (chapter 6), as well\nas a discussion of what we would now call logical connectives and\nnon-truth-functional propositions (chapter 9). The theory of\ndefinition returns in chapters 15 and 16 in the context of scientific\napplications. Finally, chapters 17\u201320 on the conversion of\npropositions contain part of the Port-Royal version of the medieval\ndoctrine of distribution.\n\nPart III focuses on rules for syllogistic reasoning, and is divided\ninto 20 chapters. Although the authors insist that most erroneous\nreasoning is based on false premises rather than incorrect inferences\n(Logic, 9), they believe the study of syllogistic forms can\nbe helpful for exercising the mind. The Logic classifies\nsyllogisms into simple and conjunctive, and simple syllogisms into\ncomplex and noncomplex (despite the awkward terminology). After\ndefining terms in chapters 1 and 2, they present general rules for\nsimple, noncomplex syllogisms in chapter 3. This chapter completes\ntheir reworked version of the theory of the distribution of terms,\nbegun in the last four chapters of Part II. Chapters 4 through 8\nexplain with innovative compactness (albeit still with tedious detail)\nthe figures and moods of simple syllogisms, again reproducing\ntraditional Aristotelian and medieval results. In chapters 9 through\n13 the Logic treats in a less formal way principles for\nrecognizing validity in syllogisms that are not simple. Chapters 14,\n15, and 16 discuss respectively enthymemes, sorites (syllogisms with\nmore than three propositions) and dilemmas. Despite their view that\nthe traditional theory of topics (the method for finding arguments) is\nespecially lacking utility, the authors treat it in chapters 17 and\n18. \u201cThose who object to this can spare themselves by not\nreading them\u201d (Logic, 11). Here they criticize\nAristotle, Ramus, and the Scholastics. Finally, chapters 19 and 20\ndiscuss sophisms and fallacies.\n\nThe Logic ends with Part IV on method. The first three Parts\nof the book correspond to the tripartite layout of traditional logic\ntexts. Part IV, however, constitutes an innovation reflecting the\nauthors\u2019 enthusiasm for the philosophy of Descartes and Pascal.\nChapter 1 lays the groundwork in Descartes\u2019 and\nAugustine\u2019s rationalism, criticizing the role of the senses in\nproviding knowledge, as well as the claims of Academic and Pyrrhonian\nskeptics. After spelling out the methods of analysis and synthesis in\nchapter 2, chapters 3 through 10 focus on the methods of geometry,\nincluding rules of definitions, axioms, and demonstrations. Chapter 11\nthen recapituates eight rules of scientific method. Finally, chapters\n12 through 16 contrast the nature of rationally obtained knowledge\nwith faith or belief.\n4. Ideas\n\nIn the Logic, ideas are the basic terms, or elements, of the\nart of thinking,\n\n\n\u2026the reflections we can make on our ideas are perhaps the most\nimportant part of logic, since they are the foundation for everything\nelse. (I.1, 25)\n\n\nAll operations of the mind involve ideas. The Logic\ncharacterizes ideas in the Cartesian way. They are, in the first\nplace, individuated by their objects. Ideas are \u201cas it were the\nimages of things\u201d as Descartes wrote (Meditations,\nThird meditation [CSM II, 25]). The notion of an image is taken\ngenerally; some very important ideas, the idea of God for example, are\nnot acquired by sensory perception. The Logic takes pains to\nemphasize this aspect of rationalist philosophy Thinking about a thing\nrequires an idea that represents the thing. Because ideas are in this\nsense objective, i.e., of objects, they can be classified according to\nthe metaphysical classification of their objects. In the Cartesian\nmetaphysics of the Logic, there are three fundamental kinds\nof objects, substances, unchanging aspects of substances called\n\u201cattributes\u201d, and features that change over time called\n\u201cmodes\u201d. Although Arnauld elsewhere takes up metaphysical\nquestions about the relation between ideas and their objects, then are\nnot taken up here (see Nadler 1989).\n\nDescartes\u2019 contrast between ideas that are clear and distinct as\nopposed to ideas that are obscure and confused is central to the\nLogic. It is primarily concerned with the ways in which\nthought arrives at the truth; the epistemic status of the ideas with\nwhich one thinks is more basic than rules for proceeding from one\nthought to another (Gaukroger 1989, Nelson 2017). Although Descartes\nis usually read as considering the clarity and distinctness of an idea\nto be a psychological criterion external to the idea itself (but see\nLennon 2008: 137\u201348), the Logic agrees with Spinoza\nthat perceptions of unconfused, true ideas are known as such without\nrecourse to a criterion of the sort sought by ancient sceptics. A good\nexample of the employment of clarity and distinctness is provided by\nthe characterization of the attributes and modes of\nsubstances. Again following Descartes, according to the Logic\nan attribute is recognized by one\u2019s inability to distinctly\nperceive a substance if one of its attributes is excluded from it.\nExtension, for example, is an attribute of bodies. Bodies cannot be\ndistinctly perceived except as extended. A mode cannot be distinctly\nperceived except in relation to the substance of which it is a mode,\nbut substances can be distinctly perceived while some particular modes\nare excluded from them. A mind can be distinctly perceived without the\nthought of a particular pain, but that particular thought is only\nconfusedly perceived unless it is perceived as that mind\u2019s\nthought.\n\nCommunication with others requires that ideas be expressed with words.\nComplex thought and the accumulation of personal knowledge are also\nhardly possible without recourse to words. Thinking and expressing\nthought with words with insufficient care, however, are the main\nsources of error. Much thinking takes place with exclusive attention\nto words without regard for the ideas signified by those words. It is\nalso common for the association between words and ideas to drift in\nways that damage the coherence of thought. The priority of thought to\nlinguistic expressions is put in extreme terms.\n\n\nIf reflection on our thoughts never concerned anyone but ourselves, it\nwould be enough to examine them in themselves, unclothed in words or\nother signs. (Logic, 23)\n\n\nThis has the practical result that most disputes are verbal.\nDisagreement about clearly and distinctly ideas themselves is\nvirtually impossible. Careful assignment of words to ideas making use\nof explicit definitions when necessary minimizes disputes. This\nstresses the importance of precisely tracking how words are associated\nwith ideas (I.12, 62).\n\nNevertheless, it is practically impossible to do all one\u2019s\nthinking without words and other symbolic representations. And it\nwould also be tiresome in a philosophical treatise to repeatedly\nexplain whether the author is referring to words, or to the ideas for\nwhich they stand, or to both at once. The Logic depends on\nthe reader to use context to make the appropriate disambiguations.\n\nIdeas fall into classes that parallel the Cartesian ontology. Ideas of\nsubstances are conventionally associated with ideas of nouns and thus\nfurther associated with written and spoken words, which are themselves\nobjects of the word-ideas. Ideas of attributes and modes are\nassociated with abstract nouns such as \u201chardness\u201d and\n\u201cjustice\u201d, as well as by adjectives such as\n\u201chard\u201d and \u201cjust\u201d (I.2, 30\u201331). Words\nthemselves signify objects only transitively, as it were, via ideas of\nwords and then ideas of objects. The Logic often takes the\nshortcut of writing as though words directly signify things. It\ndepends on the reader to keep the full chain of associations in mind.\nThe logical distinction between general terms and particular or\nsingular ones emerges from ideas of attributes and modes. As noted\nabove, these ideas are most distinct when conceived along with the\nidea of the substance on which they depend. When they are conceived\nwithout attention to their substance idea, they can represent\nadditional objects. This is illustrated with a geometrical\nexample.\n\nGeneral or abstract ideas are an important class of ideas are derived\nfrom ideas of particular things. Although everything that exists is\nsingular, ideas can represent more than one thing. The general idea of\na triangle represents all particular triangles. Next, proper nouns\nwhich indicate single individuals, such as \u201cSocrates\u201d,\n\u201cRome\u201d, \u201cBucephalus\u201d, are distinguished from\ncommon or appellative nouns such as \u201cman\u201d,\n\u201ccity\u201d, \u201chorse\u201d, which can indicate more than\none thing. Throughout the text, the authors call both universal ideas\nand common nouns \u201cgeneral terms.\u201d The mental process\nyielding the ideas associated with general terms is explained with a\ngeometrical example.\n\n\n\u2026 if I draw an equilateral triangle on a piece of paper, and if\nI concentrate on examining it on this paper along with all the\naccidental circumstances surrounding it, I shall have an idea of only\na single triangle. But if I ignore all the particular circumstances\nand focus on the thought that the triangle is a figure bounded by\nthree equal lines, the idea I form will, on the one hand, represent\nmore clearly the equality of the lines and, on the other, be able to\nrepresent all equilateral triangles. (I.5, 38)\n\n\nSimilarly, one can ignore the equality of the lines and have a more\nabstract idea representing all triangles. Ignoring the number of lines\nenables one to represent all plane figures, and so on. It is easy to\nsee how this works for ideas of modes such as red, loud, painful, etc.\nIt is noteworthy that the authors affirm that all existences are\nparticular. Their construal of abstract ideas and the words associated\nwith them constitutes a thoroughgoing nominalism about the\nsignification of abstract ideas and the words associated with\nthem.\n\nMedieval philosophers explained the significance of general terms by a\ncomplex theory of supposition (see Spade 1982). The Logic\ncondenses this framework so that the significance of general ideas has\ntwo aspects: the comprehension and the extension.\nThe comprehension consists in the set of attributes essential to the\nidea. For example, the comprehension of the idea\n\u201ctriangle\u201d includes the attributes extension, shape, three\nlines, three angles, etc. The extension of the idea consists in the\nparticular objects to which it applies, which includes \u201call the\ndifferent species of triangles\u201d (I.6, 39\u201340). Here the\nauthors confuse matters by trying to incorporate the traditional terms\n\u201cinferiors\u201d and \u201cspecies\u201d, taking the latter\nfor individual objects. Usually, however, they straightforwardly take\nthe extension of a general idea to be the individuals possessing the\nattributes in its comprehension. There are three key features of this\ntheory of signification. First, the comprehension rather than the\nextension is essential to the function of a general idea: one cannot\nremove an attribute without destroying it\u2014making it into a\ndifferent idea, whereas one can restrict its extension by applying it\nto only some of the objects that fall under it. Second, the\ncomprehension governs the extension: the set of attributes determines\nthe individuals in its extension. Finally, comprehensions and\nextensions are inversely related. In adding attributes to the\ncomprehension of an idea one restricts its extension. For example, the\ncomprehension of the idea \u201cmammal\u201d includes that of the\nidea \u201canimal\u201d so the extension of \u201canimal\u201d\nincludes that of \u201cmammal.\u201d The Logic implicitly\nassumes this principle throughout the text. In recognizing these two\nmodes of the signification of words\u2014both the comprehension of\nthe associated idea and the objects in the extension\u2014it replaces\nthe traditional distinction between incomplete and complete entities\nin the treatment of the signification of general terms.\n\nIt is tempting to interpret the Logic as providing a\nprecursor of contemporary semantic theories in which comprehension is\nlike meaning or Fregean sense and extension is like reference. The\ncomprehension of a term does usually determine the objects in its\nextension. It must be remembered, however that it is psychological\nideas and not words that have comprehensions. No ideas are identically\nshared among minds, so only in the case of innate ideas or complexes\nstrictly defined in terms of innate ideas can communication result in\nsomething like transmission of meanings in the modern sense. Hacking\n(1975) argues that seventeenth-century texts, including the\nLogic, are primarily concerned with mental discourse and do\nnot include a philosophy of language at all.\n\nMoving to linguistic terms and their association with ideas, the\nauthors first take up the noun system. This is mostly drawn from Part\nII of the Port-Royal Grammar. As explained in Part II of the\nLogic, nouns are names of objects, that is, substances and\nattributes. Substantive nouns such as \u201cearth\u201d and\n\u201csun\u201d signify substances, and adjectival nouns such as\n\u201cgood\u201d and \u201cjust\u201d signify attributes,\n\u201cindicating at the same time the subject to which they\napply\u2026\u201d. Just as substances are ontologically prior to\ntheir manners or modes, nouns are prior to adjectives in the structure\nof language. From the adjective one then creates a secondary\nsubstantive, an abstract noun:\n\n\nafter having formed the adjective human from the substantive\nword man, we form the substantive humanity from the\nadjective human. (II.1, 74)\n\n\nThus there are three kinds of nouns: concrete substantives,\nadjectives, and abstract substantives. The Logic says that\nadjectives have two significations: a distinct signification of the\nmode or manner, and a confused signification of the subject. Although\nthe signification of the mode is more distinct, it is indirect; by\ncontrast the confused signification of the subject is direct (II.1,\n74\u201375). This is because the idea of a mode is distinctly\nperceived only when its substance is perceived along with it. So every\nnoun picks out or distinctly signifies one thing, either an\nindividual, a collection of individuals, or an attribute. Concrete\nsubstantives distinctly signify complete objects, that is, individual\nsubstances: \u201cman\u201d distinctly signifies human beings. The\nadjective \u201chuman\u201d distinctly signifies the attribute of\nbeing human. And abstract substantives such as \u201chumanity\u201d\nalso pick out this attribute distinctly. But the adjective\n\u201chuman\u201d, unlike the concrete substantive\n\u201cman\u201d, is linguistically incomplete, since it means\n\u201ca human [being]\u201d. Linguistically, adjectives are gappy\nand require completion by a substantive to signify. The Logic\nidentifies this incomplete signification as the connotation\nor confused (but direct) signification of an adjective. So adjectives\nsignify ideas of substances directly and confusedly, and\nideas of attributes indirectly and distinctly. Because\nsubstantive nouns of both kinds are linguistically complete, they lack\nconnotation and have only distinct and direct signification to the\nindividual substances or attributes they name.\n\nThe production of general ideas from less general ones is, as we have\nseen, effected by the mind separating or deleting some components of\nthe less general idea. The general idea of triangle could be produced\nby deleting equilaterality from the idea of an equilateral triangle.\nSimilarly, ideas of greater complexity can be formed by combining less\ncomplex ideas. If, for example, one imagines a pink elephant, that\nidea is formed by combining an idea of an elephant with an idea of\npink. The mental act of affirming or denying one idea of another is\ncalled judging. Mental operations of special importance to logic are\nthose that result in propositions. This is the focus of the next part\nof the Logic.\n5. Judgment and Propositions\n\nThe mental act of judging includes both affirming one idea agrees with\nanother and denying such agreement. In affirmation, the result is a\njoining of the ideas; they are judged to agree with each other. In\ndenial, the result is a separation of the ideas; they are judged to be\n\u201crepugnant\u201d to each other. \u201cAgreement\u201d and\n\u201crepugnance\u201d are unpacked in terms of the crucial notions\nof comprehension and extension. When one judges that \u201cs\nis P\u201d, affirms that the comprehension of s\nincludes the comprehension of P and that s is\nincluded in the extension of P. Because ideas are\ncharacterized by their objects, a judgment is true when the ideas are\nrelated as the objects are related. As usual, this works\nstraightforwardly only when the ideas are sufficiently clear and\ndistinct. If one\u2019s idea of Arnauld confusedly contains the\nattribute of being married, then one might erroneously judge that the\nidea of Arnauld agrees with the idea of being married.\n\nJudgments are also called propositions, so propositions are mental\nentities. The priority of thought to language thus includes the point\nthat linguistic expressions of mental propositions are propositions in\na derivative, verbal sense. Verbal propositions are usually simply\ncalled \u201cpropositions\u201d and the reader is expected to sort\nthis out by context. Additionally supposing that the reader will not\nforget the distinction between thought and language, the authors use\nthe terms \u201csubject\u201d and \u201cpredicate\u201d to refer\nboth to the ideas making up a judgment and to the linguistic\nexpressions of the subject and predicate ideas. Because every simple\njudgment is composed of a subject idea and a predicate idea that are\nrelated by an act of affirmation or denial, the subject and predicate\nideas are expressed linguistically in the simplest case by a proper or\nsubstantive noun and a common noun or adjective. The affirmation is\nexpressed by a verb; expressions of denial add a negative word (II.3,\n82\u20133). Arnauld and Nicole criticize Aristotle and other\nphilosophers who combine the copula with features of the predicate\n(time) and subject (person); in a language mirroring Cartesian\nthought, there would be only one substantive verb, namely\nto be. In fact, natural languages often combine the predicate\nwith the verb, as in \u201cPeter lives\u201d, and Latin verbs\nsometimes express all three elements of judgment in one word, as in\ncogito and sum. Such verbs as \u201clives\u201d\ncan always be expressed with verb phrases including \u201cis\u201d\nand a noun phrase. The proposition \u201cPeter lives\u201d for\nexample, can be linguistically rendered as \u201cPeter is\nliving.\u201d\n\nThe doctrine that judgment arises exclusively from mental acts of\naffirmation and denial raises some important philosophical questions.\nFirst, if it is an act of affirmation or denial that\nresults in a proposition, there seems to be no room for doubting or\nsuspending judgment on a proposition. The Logic proposes a\n\u201cone act\u201d theory of affirmation and denial. Another kind\nof theory would require two acts: first, the formulation of a\njudgment, and second, affirming or denying it. In much post-Fregean\nphilosophy it is a requirement that propositions can be thought\nwithout asserting them and that mental \u201cattitudes\u201d such as\nbelieving, hoping, fearing, etc. can be taken regarding a proposition\nthat is neither affirmed nor denied.\n\nIn the Logic, however, things are different because of the\noft-cited sense in which thought is prior to language. Well formulated\nmental propositions can, in principle, be thought wordlessly\u2014a\nlinguistic sentence will rarely mirror the form of a thought with\nperfect accuracy. This means that to affirm a verbal proposition is\nnot always to have a clear and distinct perception of it. In a\ngenerally Cartesian theory of the mind, what is plausibly called\n\u201centertaining\u201d or \u201csuspending judgment\u201d on a\nproposition does not require a mental act apart from affirming or\ndenying. Suppose one thinks the proposition,\nP, but simultaneously thinks much more\nclearly the proposition, \u201cI should investigate the truth of\nP\u201d, or the proposition\nQ where Q is\nincompatible withP. Those states of mind\nseems to answer at least as well to the description \u201cmerely\nentertaining P\u201d as does a special\nmental act of entertaining or \u201csuspending judgment\non\u201d P. The authors could even claim\nthat one never does merely entertain a proposition\nP without the further concomitant judgment\nthat P is to some extent doubtful, or that\nit would be rash to act on P without further\ninvestigating whether P is true, etc.\n\nA second set of related questions is raised by the treatment of\nlogical operations in modern quantificational logic.\n\n\nIndeed, a loose chronicle of the role of the proposition in modern\nphilosophy runs as follows: Most of the important Early Moderns\nconflated the formation of a thought that has propositional content\nwith endorsement of that content and simply failed to see the\ndisastrous logical and epistemological implications of this\nconflation. Part of Frege\u2019s genius, the story goes, was to see\nthrough this mess and clearly distinguish propositional content from\njudgment from assertoric force. (Maru\u0161i\u0107 2014: 255)\n\n\nComplex propositions are subject to a generalized version of what is\nnow called the Frege-Geach problem. In a conditional proposition, for\nexample, it might seem that one could affirm the conditional without\nseparately affirming its components. But in the Logic, the\npropositions constituting the antecedent and consequent are formed by\nan act of affirmation (or denial). The proposition, \u201cIf the\nEarth is flat, then astronomy needs revision\u201d should be\naffirmable without one\u2019s accepting the antecedent as true, i.e.,\nwithout affirming it.\n\nThe authors take no notice of this problem and do not directly address\nit. When discussing complex propositions, the Logic shifts\nfrom explicit considerations of comprehension and extension to truth\nconditions. A conditional is false when the antecedent is true and the\nconsequent false and true when both are true; a conjunction is true\nwhen both conjuncts are true and false otherwise, and so on in the\nfamiliar way. Regarding conditional propositions, the Logic\nadditionally relates them to inferences. To think \u201cIf\nP then Q\u201d is\nto think of deducing the consequent from the antecedent (II.9, 100).\nFrom the perspective of Kant (for example), these problems stem from\nsupposing that mental propositions are formed by merely combining or\n\u201cfusing\u201d elements together. If conditionalizing,\ndisjoining, predicating, etc. are taken to be mental operations\ndistinct from affirmation and denial, a closer connection between\nmental and verbal propositions becomes possible (see Section 1 of\n Kant\u2019s theory of judgment).\n\nA different device comes into play for modal judgments of possibility\nand necessity (II.8). Verbal propositions including modal terms such\nas \u201cpossible\u201d and \u201cnecessary\u201d express mental\npropositions in which the basic acts of affirmation and denial are\nmodified. The ideas entering into modal propositions are not\nthemselves modified (Van der Scharr 2008: 334\u2013335;\nMaru\u0161i\u0107 2014: 277\u2013278). The authors label such acts\n\u201ctacit\u201d or \u201cvirtual\u201d affirmations (II.7, 93).\nIt seems open to the authors to regard such complex thoughts as\nconditionals, conjunctions, and disjunctions as similarly involving\nmodified affirmations, but they do not explicitly endorse this\nstrategy.\n\nNegation also raises interesting questions for the theory in the\nLogic. The act of denial extends to the entire judgment; this\nis expressed by the linguistic \u201cnot\u201d attaching to the\nverb. As Frege points out in his essay \u201cNegation\u201d (1918),\nthis account does not neatly fit with the requirement that a false\nthought be recognized as false. It seems that propositions must be\naffirmed (as true) or denied (as a true negation). For example, to\nrecognize that \u201c3 is greater than 5\u201d is false requires\nhaving a complete thought, and not merely fragments of a thought.\nSimilarly, there seems to be no room for true thoughts that have false\nthoughts as their components, such as true conditionals with false\nantecedents. In addition, the Logic seems to have trouble\nwith double negation. If denying separates the thought into its parts,\nthen double negation would function as a sword that magically unites\nthe parts it had sundered (Frege 1918 [1952: 122\u2013129]). From a\nmodern perspective, the root problem in treating negation as denial is\nonce again the failure to distinguish the thought or proposition that\nis grasped from the act of judging it.\n\nFrege\u2019s problems here stem from his requirement that the\nstructure of thought conform perfectly with a notation for expressing\nthe thought. The Logic \u201cpsychologistically\u201d\nprioritizes the theory of thought over the theory of symbolization. If\nthe authors had faced Frege\u2019s objections, they could have\ninsisted on inherent limitations in verbal expressions of thought.\nWhen one clearly and distinctly perceives that \u201c5 is greater\nthan 3\u201d it is always affirmed. It is psychologically impossible\nto affirm \u201c3 is greater than 5\u201d unless the ideas are badly\nconfused. If someone were to verbally assert \u201c3 is greater than\n5\u201d, it would be a mystery what they were thinking\nunless it was a proposition about the words. Asserting a well-formed\nverbal expression corresponds to a well-formed thought only insofar as\nthe thought is clear and distinct. Double negations are common in\ncomplex verbal propositions, but the Logic is not committed\nto these words signifying iterated \u201cseparations\u201d that\nresult in rejoinings. They can simply stand for affirmations. This\nmeans that when denial is described as \u201cseparating\u201d ideas,\nthat should be understood metaphorically. Denial in the Logic\nis perhaps better described as the recognition that the idea of the\npredicate is not among those included in the comprehension of the idea\nof the subject. And as usual, thoughts that are confused need to be\nsorted out before they can be precisely expressed. The same holds for\ntriple negations and denials. (For a further discussion, see section\n2.7.1 of the entry on\n Frege.)\n\nThe Logic\u2019s view of proposition formation also suggests\na problem for embedded generality (Buroker 1994). Subordinate clauses\nmust be located in either the subject or the predicate. But some\nembedded clauses make assertions and some do not. Despite the two\nverbs in the complex proposition \u201cMen who are pious are\ncharitable\u201d, for example, it is clear that one is not affirming\nof all men or even some men that they are pious. On the other hand,\n\u201cGod who is invisible created the world which is visible\u201d\npermits three assertions, \u201cGod is invisible\u201d, \u201cThe\nworld is visible\u201d, and \u201cGod created the world\u201d\n(II.5, 87). The Logic explains the difference between these\ntwo kinds of embedding in terms of \u201cdeterminative\u201d and\n\u201cexplicative\u201d subordinate clauses (or, as they say,\nrelative pronouns, see II.6\u20138). Determinative subordinate\nclauses restrict the signification of the antecedent of the relative\npronoun (e.g., \u201cmen who are pious\u201d) whereas explicative\nclauses do not (e.g., \u201cGod who is invisible\u201d). In fact\nboth determinations and explications can be carried out as well\nwithout embedded or subordinate clauses, as in the sentences\n\u201cPious men are charitable\u201d and \u201cThe invisible God\ncreated the visible world.\u201d When working these cases out, as\nusual in the Logic,\n\n\nit is often necessary to pay more attention to the meaning and the\nspeaker\u2019s intention than to the expression alone. (II.6, 90)\n\n\nPart II on judgment concludes in Chapters 17\u201320 with rules for\nthe conversion of verbal propositions, which is the exchanging of\nsubject and predicate terms. These operations on propositions are the\nLogic\u2019s reworking of the traditional theory of the\ndistribution of terms which in turn depended on a complicated theory\nof \u201csupposition\u201d (Spade 1982, Parsons 2006, Martin 2020).\nIn traditional logic, elaborate rules of conversion were necessary to\nrelate the premises of a syllogism to each other and to the\nconclusion. This is mostly unnecessary in the Logic\u2019s\ntreatment of syllogistic inference in Part III, but the authors take\nthe opportunity to display simplified conversion rules developed on\nthe basis of a few \u201caxioms\u201d regarding the containment\nrelationships between the comprehensions and extensions of terms.\n6. Reasoning and Formal Methods\n\nPart III begins with a preamble warning the reader not to accord too\nmuch importance to formal rules of reasoning.\n\n\nThe majority of people\u2019s errors, as we have already said\nelsewhere [i.e., on p. 9], depend more on reasoning based on false\nprinciples, than from reasoning incorrectly from their principles. We\nrarely allow ourselves to be misled by arguments that are defective\nmerely because the conclusion is badly drawn. And those who could not\nrecognize a fallacy by the light of reason alone would usually not be\nable to understand the rules behind it, much less to apply them.\n(Logic, 135; also see III.9, 157 and IV.20, 203)\n\n\nHere the authors stress that a good logic is a means for acquiring\nknowledge rather than a tool for organizing it into premises and\nconclusion. The final point is that when ideas are made properly clear\nand distinct, the natural light of reason requires no assistance from\nrules. We had been previously warned that primary utility of formal\nrules consists in the exercise of the natural light that might come\nfrom working through them. The authors continued that evaluation by\npointing out that the chapter titles can guide readers in omitting\nthis relatively unimportant \u201cexercise\u201d if they wish\n(Logic, 10). They thus regard Part IV on method as more\nimportant than Part III on formal reasoning.\n\nThe classification of syllogisms for formal treatment depends on the\nclassification of propositions although the latter is in the service\nof the former. The Logic accordingly classifies simple\ncategorical propositions into four forms: universal affirmatives (All\nS is P), universal negatives (No S is\nP), particular affirmatives (Some S is P)\nand particular negatives (Some S is not P). Simple\ncategorical syllogisms are arguments with a major premise, a minor\npremise, and a conclusion. They contain only three terms. The major\npremise has the \u201cmiddle\u201d term and the attribute of the\nconclusion (the \u201cmajor\u201d term), while the minor premise has\nthe middle term and the subject of the conclusion (the\n\u201cminor\u201d term). In Part II, the Logic prepares for\nthis by adopting the theory of categorical propositions, classifying\nthem in terms of quantity as universal, particular, or singular, and\nin terms of quality as affirmative or negative. It takes the\ntraditional stand that singular propositions function logically like\nuniversals, so all simple propositions have one of the following four\nforms:\n\nA:\nAll S is P\nE:\nNo S is P\nI:\nSome S is P\nO:\nSome S is not P\n\n\nAlso following the tradition, the Logic treats the\nquantifiers \u201call\u201d and \u201csome\u201d as part of the\nsubject, so that \u201call men\u201d and \u201csome men\u201d are\nlogically significant units. In explaining the rules of conversion for\nsubject and predicate terms, in Part II, chapter 17 they argue that\npredicates are implicitly quantified: when one says \u201cAll lions\nare animals\u201d, one does not normally think that all lions are\nall the animals, but only some of the animals. So\n\u201cAll S is P\u201d in general means \u201cAll\nS is (some) P\u201d (II.17, 130).\n\nConsider, for example this syllogism.\n\n\nEvery good prince is loved by his subjects.\nEvery pious king is a good prince.\nTherefore every pious king is loved by his subjects. (III.2,\n137)\n\n\n\nHere, the term \u201cgood prince\u201d is the middle term, because\nit appears in both premises but not in the conclusion. Traditional\nlogic categorizes forms of syllogisms according to their\n\u201cmood\u201d and their \u201cfigure\u201d. The mood is the\narrangement of the three propositions in the\n A E I O forms.\n The figure is the arrangement of the major, minor, and middle terms\nin the three propositions.\n\nMost propositions, however, are more complex than this classification\nsuggests, for subjects and predicates need not be simple. In the\nproposition \u201cGod who is invisible created the world which is\nvisible\u201d, both the subject and predicate include subordinate\nclauses that appear to contain propositions (II.5\u20138). Because of\nthe overall subject-predicate structure of all propositions, embedded\npropositions must be located in the subject or predicate. Because\npropositions can be complex, so can syllogisms. That becomes important\nin Part III when rules of inference are discussed, because all\npropositions, including conditionals and disjunctives, are forced into\nstandard categorical forms. The treatment of verbal propositions,\nthen, requires that subjects and predicates have unlimited complexity.\nThere is, therefore, no basic inventory of simple linguistic parts\npermitting a recursive analysis, as in the modern classification of\nvariables, function or predicate symbols, and logical symbols. On the\nclassical view the proposition has a simple organic unity from the\noutside and a reiterable complexity from the inside. This again shows\nthe importance of the authors\u2019 commitment to the priority of\nthought over linguistic expressions of thought. Complexity is to be\nresolved in mental propositions by careful and attentive thinking\ninstead of by perspicuous verbal notation.\n\nWith this treatment of classification in hand, the Logic\nproceeds to examine rules of formal inference. In traditional logic,\nthe rules for syllogism are connected with rules for the conversion of\npropositions which in turn are connected with the distribution of\nterms. A term is distributed if it is \u201ctaken\nuniversally\u201d or refers to all the individuals it denotes;\notherwise it is undistributed (Kneale & Kneale 1962 [1984: 272]).\nAs Parsons (2006: 61) puts it, the denotation of a term is its\nextension on its own, whereas its reference is its extension in a\nproposition. Thus the term \u201cprince\u201d denotes (i.e., is\npredicable of) all princes, but in the proposition \u201cSome princes\nare just\u201d, the quantifier \u201cSome\u201d restricts its\nextension in the proposition (its reference) to a subset of its\nextension on its own (denotation). According to the rules for\ndistribution stated by medieval logicians, the subject terms of\nuniversal propositions and the predicates of negative propositions are\ndistributed or taken universally throughout their extension; all other\nterms are undistributed. The Logic subsumes a streamlined\nversion of these rules in chapters 17\u201320 of Part II, in its\nexplanation of the conversion of propositions, accounting for them in\nterms of the comprehensions and extensions of the terms (II.17,\n130\u201331).\n\nChapter 3 of Part III gives six rules for valid simple categorical\nsyllogisms. These rules conform to standard medieval logic, but they\nare derived from the Part II rules mentioned above for converting\npropositions. The first two rules for syllogisms govern the\ndistribution of terms.\n\n\nRule 1: The middle term cannot be taken particularly twice,\nbut must be taken universally at least once.\nRule 2: The terms of the conclusion cannot be taken more\nuniversally in the conclusion than in the premises. (III.3,\n139\u201340)\n\n\n\nThe remaining four rules express the standard views that\n\nat least one premise must be affirmative,\nthe conclusion must be affirmative if both premises are\naffirmative,\nif one premise is negative the conclusion must be negative,\nand\nnothing follows from two particular premises (III.3,\n141\u201342).\n\n\nChapter 4 begins a series of chapters that develops more specific\nrules for correctly drawing inferences. The three propositions of a\nsyllogism can be in one of the\n four A E I O categories.\n This mathematically yields sixty-four arrangements into syllogisms:\nAAA, AAE, AAI, AAO, AEA, \u2026 OOO. Of these, only fifty-four are\ncompatible with the six general rules for syllogisms. When these moods\nare duly arranged into figures, further rules are required to\ndetermine which have true premises and conclusions (III.4). The\nLogic thus emphasizes soundness over\nvalidity\u2014presumably because arguments with false conclusions are\n\u201cuseless\u201d in application. Much of the\nLogic\u2019s subsequent importance as a work in formal logic\nis owing to what Kneale and Kneale (1962 [1984: 319]) refer to as the\n\u201cquasi-mathematical\u201d rigor with which these rules are\nderived and stated.\n\nChapter 9 moves on to complex syllogisms. These involve a complex\nconclusion in which the terms \u201care not always joined in their\nentirety to the middle term in each of the premises, but only to a\npart of one of these terms\u201d. This example is provided in which\nthe attribute of the conclusion is split across the attributes of the\npremises:\n\n\nThe sun is an insensible thing.\nThe Persians worshipped the sun.\nTherefore the Persians worshipped an insensible thing.\n(III.9,158)\n\n\n\nTraditional logic texts (and the first edition of the Logic)\nmethodically discuss how to reduce complex syllogisms to simple ones.\nLater editions of the Logic abbreviate this\n\u201cpedantry\u201d in favor of a general principle for reducing\ncomplex syllogisms, or actually, to evaluate them directly without an\nexplicit reduction. The general principle is that the conclusion\nmust be contained in the premises. The principle is applied by\nmaking a characteristic Cartesian move. One is to come up with a\n\u201cbetter known\u201d proposition from which the conclusion\nfollows\u2014the \u201ccontaining\u201d proposition (III.10,163).\nThen one needs another proposition that shows that the conclusion is\nindeed contained in the containing proposition\u2014this is the\n\u201capplicative\u201d proposition. Recall that the comprehension\nof a term contains all the attributes constituting it while the\nextension contains the objects that have those attributes.\n\nThe application of the general principle is not governed by any\nfurther rules; that would defeat its purpose. Instead, in Chapter 11 a\nseries of examples is provided showing the general principle in\naction. Evidently, working through the examples is meant to provide an\nexercise in the direct deployment of their faculty for rationally\n\u201cseeing\u201d which inferences are valid. It is noteworthy that\nthe examples proceed by taking the conclusion, the\n\u201cquestion\u201d, to be true. The authors are thus more\ninterested in the soundness of useful arguments than they are in the\nmore theoretical notion of validity. For a detailed examination of the\ngeneral principle in action see Pariente (1985) and Wahl (2018).\n\nThe next chapters proceed to consider \u201cconjunctive\u201d\nsyllogisms. Such syllogisms include, for example, a conditional\nproposition in a premise or the conclusion or a disjunction in the\nmajor premise. No new formal rules are introduced to deal with these.\nInstead, the Logic again runs through many examples which are\ntreated by inspection (as we now say) making use of \u201cthe natural\nlight of reason\u201d (III.9, 158, see also p. 23). This is\nunderstandable given the scope of the general principle established in\nthe preceding chapters.\n\nChapters 19 and 20 conclude Part III with an extended treatment of\nfallacious reasoning in learned contexts as well as in everyday life.\nSophisms and fallacies are taxonomized, copiously illustrated, and\nattributed to specific flaws of intellectual character in those who\npropagate them. These chapters occupy nearly as many pages as the\nmaterial on formal reasoning. With updated examples, these chapters\ncould compete with textbooks currently in use in college courses on\n\u201cinformal logic\u201d.\n7. Method, Science, and Faith\n\nPart IV begins by rehearsing the defense of metaphysical and\nscientific knowledge against skeptical philosophy. Following\nDescartes, it is argued that some items can be so distinctly perceived\nthat they cannot be sincerely doubted. That one must exist in order to\nthink, credited to Augustine rather than Descartes, is cited as an\nexample. \u201cThe whole is greater than the part\u201d and similar\nprinciples constitute another set of examples which were not much\ndisputed. The same holds for geometrical propositions, but when\nCartesians took these as being true of the essence of matter,\nsceptical resistance was plentiful. Against this, the authors\u2019\nonly counter is that careful attention reveals the truth as they see\nit.\n\nChapter 2 introduces a version of the crucial distinction between the\nmethods of analysis (sometimes called resolution) and\nsynthesis (sometimes called composition). The authors regard\nanalysis as more important method because it is a method for\ndiscovering truths. Synthesis is the presentation of knowledge as\nfollowing from given premises. The material might be presented as\nformal deductions as in logic texts including Part III of the\nLogic. An alternative kind of synthetic presentation finds a\nconclusion in geometrical style as following from definitions and\naxioms. Descartes argued that the main function of synthesis is to\ninstruct others in what is already known\u2014especially to compel\ntheir assent if they are \u201cargumentative or stubborn\u201d\n(Meditations, Replies to second set of objections [CSM II,\n110\u2013111]).\n\nAn analytic treatment begins with the question under\nexamination\u2014the item that is to be analytically demonstrated. A\nsuccessful analysis separates out what is contained in the question\nuntil some previously known items are found. One example the authors\nprovide is a sketch of an analysis of magnetic phenomena, summarizing\na case that Descartes dealt with in some detail (IV.2, 236; Descartes\nRules, rule 12 [CSM I, 49\u201350] and Descartes 1644, Part\n4 [CSM I, 276\u2013279]. Carefully attending to a lodestone, the goal\nis to\n\n\ndistinctly conceive a certain combination of beings and natures that\nare known to us so as to produce all the effects we see in\nmagnets.\n\n\nIf the previously known \u201cbeings and natures\u201d are revealed\nto have been contained in the question and thus to analytically follow\nfrom it, the analysis is complete. If instead some absurdity or\nimpossibility is contained in the question, the analysis shows it is\nfalse. Because analysis depends on this kind of careful attention to\nwhat is contained, the method \u201cconsists more in judgment and\nmental skill than in particular rules\u201d (IV.2, 238).\n\nThis description is closely related to the general principle that the\nLogic laid down for the evaluation of syllogisms. That\nprinciple required that one take the conclusion of a syllogism as true\nand then examine or inspect what is contained in the conclusion in\nsearch of a more general truth from which the conclusion follows.\nAlthough the Logic does not explicitly state that formal\nrules for syllogisms should be valued less than the analytic method,\nit is clear that this is what the authors had in mind when saying that\nthe only point in learning formal rules for syllogisms is obtaining\nmental exercise. Synthetic demonstrations are cheap because whenever\none has successfully performed an analysis, one is trivially in\npossession of a synthesis as well. The methods of analysis and\nsynthesis,\n\ndiffer only as the route one takes in climbing a mountain from a\nvalley differs from the route taken in descending from the mountain to\nthe valley, or as the two ways differ that are used to prove that a\nperson is descended from St. Louis. One way is to show that this\nperson had a certain man for a father who was the son of a certain\nman, and that man was the son of another, and so on up to St. Louis.\nThe other way is to begin with St. Louis and show that he had a\ncertain child, and this child had others, thereby descending to the\nperson in question (IV.2, 238)\n\nThe analogy is that if a proposition (or a genealogy) is unknown, then\none ascends to more general truths (the ancestor), but if the\nproposition (or the genealogy) is known, then one descends to the\nconclusion (the descendants). In other words, the analysis and the\nsynthesis of an item is just the same demonstration, the only\ndifference being the route or direction, i.e., whether one begins or\nends with the proposition in question (Rogers & Nelson 2015). This\nalso makes clear the sense in which method is a matter of ordering\nknowledge. In analysis one puts the conclusion first in the order and\nproceeds to find the truths that it contains. Synthesis reverses this\nbeginning with propositions that are already known and then\nunderstanding that the conclusion follows.\n\nChapters 3\u201310 are concerned in one way or another with axiomatic\npresentations of geometry. This is understandable given the reputation\nof Euclid\u2019s Elements as a model of rigorous reasoning\nand certain results. It is interesting therefore that the\nLogic also, while acknowledging the virtues of the work of\nEuclid and other geometers, offers some pointed criticisms. Applying\nlogical method to geometry was among Arnauld\u2019s many special\ninterests. He wrote a book entitled, New Elements of Geometry\n(1667) in which he attempted to remedy the faults discussed here in\nPart IV of the Logic. The authors treatment begins with some\nrules for synthetic demonstrations, especially in geometry. There are\nno surprises here. Terms must be scrupulously defined; propositions\nthat are taken to be axiomatic must be completely certain, and so on.\nAs stated, the rules might appear obvious, but they are elaborated in\na decidedly Cartesian way. The point of rules for definitions, for\nexample, is to ensure that linguistic terms become precisely\nassociated with distinct ideas. It follows that definitions\nwill be useless for those who do not have prior access to the ideas in\nquestion. Regarding rules for axioms, the main point that emerges is\nthat they must be distinctly perceived in the Cartesian sense put\nforward in Part I on ideas and Part II on propositions. This means\nthat axioms derive from innate resources and not from sensory\nexperience and that attributes must be clearly and distinctly\nperceived as included in subjects. It also means that no sincere\nskeptical questions can arise from properly chosen axioms. A good deal\nof Part IV recapitulates Descartes\u2019 unfinished manuscript,\nRules for the Direction of the Native Intellect (c. 1628).\nThis was unpublished in Latin until after the fifth edition of the\nLogic, but Arnauld had access to at least part of some\nversion of the manuscript. Chapter 7 offers as examples of \u201csome\nimportant axioms\u201d others provided by Descartes in his replies to\nthe second set of objections to the Meditations (CSM II,\n116\u2013117).\n\nThe rules for synthetic demonstrations lead to a list of criticisms of\n\u201cgeometers\u201d. Chapter 4 notes some equivocations in\nEuclid\u2019s use of \u201cangle\u201d, \u201cratio\u201d, and\n\u201cproportion.\u201d Later mathematicians are criticizes for not\nrespecting the distinction between nominal and real definitions. The\nformer should be stipulations about how words are associated with\nideas. The latter should characterize the nature of the object being\ndefined. Examples are given about disputes among prominent\nmathematicians over nominal definitions as if they were real (IV.5).\nAnother mistake the authors find geometers making is \u201cproving\nthings that do not need to be proved\u201d (IV.9, 254). This mistake\nis attributed to inattention to the connection between truth and clear\nand distinct perception. Euclid proves that that any two sides of a\ntriangle are greater than the third side. Because this is immediately\nevident, the proof violates method by mis-ordering what is known.\nAnother mistake Euclid makes in ordering is tacking back and forth\nfrom more general to more specific cases; a number of examples are\nprovided. Proper order requires always moving from more simple items\nto more complex ones. A more significant disagreement with geometrical\npractice is about indirect proofs by reductio ad absurdum.\nBecause the denial of a true proposition is always confused, the\nderivation of a contradiction will usually offer no insight into why\nthe conclusion is true (IV.9, 255\u201356). It is conceded, however,\nthat indirect proofs might be necessary when no direct proof can be\nfound, and they can be useful when a result is already obtained\ndirectly.\n\nThe Logic ends in a way befitting a treatise associated with\nthe Port-Royal abbey. The last four chapters consider how to fit into\nthe method the deliverances of knowledge derived from authority\ninstead of from reason. Knowledge from authority is of two kinds:\nknowledge from God, which is called faith, and knowledge from humans\n\u201cworthy of credence\u201d, which is called belief or opinion\n(IV.12, 260). God\u2019s deliverances are infallible, but human\nauthorities differ in their reliability. The best opinions come from\nthe constant testimony of many sources. These can reach moral\ncertainty, i.e., all the certainty that is required for practical\npurposes. Faith and opinion are, however, underwritten by reason\nbecause, according to the authors, reason reveals that God is\ninfallible and that skepticism about reliable human authority is\ngroundless.\n\nThere follow some commonsensical rules for handling opinions. For\nexample, for a proposition to be accepted as true, it need not be\nnecessary and the possibility of a proposition\u2019s truth should\nnot automatically lead to its acceptance. These rules are applied to\nevaluating claims of miracles. One should take care to evaluate all of\nthe available evidence before accepting a particular claim.\nOutstanding authorities should be generally trusted. The miracles\nrelated by Augustine, for example, will be accepted as such by\n\u201ca person of good sense\u201d (IV.14, 267). In Chapter 15, the\ncommonsensical principles for evaluating testimony are applied to some\ncases of then current interest regarding the disputed authorship of\nvarious letters and texts. Chapter 16 concludes the Logic\nwith the topic of judgments regarding the future. The authors point\nout that it is a common error to overemphasize great future harms or\nbenefits when these outcomes are very unlikely and to underemphasize\nsmall harms or benefits that are very likely or repeatable. Infinite\nbenefits require a different strategy. The observation that the\nauthors view as most important is the case made famous by fellow\nJansenist, Blaise Pascal.\n\nOnly infinite things such as eternity and salvation cannot be equalled\nby any temporal benefit. Thus we ought never balance them off against\nanything worldly. This is why the slightest bit of help for acquiring\nsalvation is worth more than all the goods of the world taken\ntogether. And the least peril of being lost is more important than all\ntemporal harms considered merely as harms.\n\nThat is enough to make all reasonable people draw this conclusion with\nwhich we will end this Logic: that the greatest of all\nfollies is to use one\u2019s time and life for something other than\nwhat may be useful for acquiring a life that will never end, since all\nthe goods and harms of this life are nothing in comparison to those of\nthe other life, and the danger of falling into those harms, as well as\nthe difficulty of acquiring these goods, is very great (IV.16,\n275)\n\nThe book\u2019s conclusion one again stresses that formal logic and\neven science are at best instrumental to the goal of living well.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Recent Editions of the Port-Royal Logic", "Works Cited or Recommended"], "cat_ref_text": {"Recent Editions of the Port-Royal Logic": ["</h3>\n<p>\nAll quotations and citations to the Port Royal Logic are to the\nBuroker translation, 1996, listed below.</p>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Arnauld, Antoine et Pierre Nicole, <em>La Logique ou l\u2019art\nde penser</em>, \u00e9dition critique par Pierre Clair et\nFran\u00e7ois Girbal, Paris.
