    "main_text": "Managing and Communicating Reproductive Risk || Alcohol and drug use during pregnancy\n4.1 Alcohol and drug use during pregnancy\n\nPregnant women who use alcohol and drugs violate deeply held cultural\nvisions of appropriate motherhood. We tend to frame any level of\ndrinking or drug use during pregnancy as indicating serious maternal\nirresponsibility. The United States and Canada advocate total\nabstinence from drinking during pregnancy, or even when becoming\npregnant is a possibility. The United Kingdom and other countries have\nrecently followed suit. And yet, while we know that alcoholic women,\nparticularly those who smoke and experience social stress such as\npoverty, are at risk for giving birth to babies with Fetal Alcohol\nSyndrome, the risk to fetuses from light to moderate maternal drinking\nis merely theoretical. Researchers have repeatedly failed to find any\nconcrete evidence of fetal harm from such drinking (Armstrong 2003,\nLee 2009). Vigilant abstention may be demanded alongside explicit\nacknowledgment of such evidence. In 2014, the Center for Disease\nControl and Prevention released an extensive study showing no\nmeasurable ill effects on children from light maternal drinking. Two\nyears later, the Center released an advisory telling all\nwomen who could become pregnant to abstain entirely from\ndrinking, whether or not they were or planned to become pregnant (CDC\nApril 2014, February 2016).\n\nIt is tempting to think that even if light drinking or drug use poses\nonly a small teratogenic risk, women are morally obligated to refrain\nfrom it. For instance, Elizabeth Harman (1999) claims that\nany smoking during a pregnancy one plans to carry to term is\n\u201cmorally impermissible\u201d, and Gilmore (2008) argues that\nwomen who are or might become pregnant ought to abstain from drinking\nany alcohol. But we cannot, of course, ask pregnant women to abstain\ncompletely from all voluntary activities carrying some fetal risk, for\nthey would be paralyzed into inactivity (which would itself come with\nsome risk). Indeed, we are not nearly so draconian in our attitudes\ntowards other, more clearly risky behaviors during pregnancy, such as\ndriving a car. Elizabeth Armstrong (2003) and Janet Golden (2006) have\nargued that widespread social anxiety over Fetal Alcohol Syndrome\nconstitutes a \u2018moral panic\u2019 over mothers engaging in what\nwe imagine as self-indulgent or decadent behavior, rather than an\nevidence-based response to risk. Focusing on the consumption of\nalcohol or drugs as a particularly pernicious form of risk-taking\nseems to have more to do with images and ideologies of maternal\nself-sacrifice, purity, and decadence than with rational concern for\nfetal well-being. The failure of extreme risk-aversion strategies to\nreliably decrease harmful behaviours and contribute to positive health\noutcomes for pregnant women and their fetuses should lead\npractitioners and researchers toward alternative approaches to\nunderstanding, communicating about, and managing risks for pregnant\nwomen (Ballantyne et al. 2016). Alternative approaches call for\nclearer understanding of fetal risk among both clinicians and policy\nmakers, and explicit consideration of the social and political values\nthat shape current forms of risk management in pregnant women.\n(Minkoff and Marshall 2016).\n\nThe ethical issues are different when we turn to pregnant women who\nseriously abuse alcohol and other drugs known to cause major damage to\nfetuses. This is undesirable behavior that we would like to prevent if\npossible, and if a woman can stop this behavior, then she ought to.\nMany states have tried to prosecute pregnant drug users for separate\ncrimes beyond illicit drug use, such as child abuse, but such charges\nhave rarely stood up in court (but see Whitner v. South Carolina,\n1997). Not infrequently, pregnant drug users have had their children\nremoved from their care at birth, or have been coerced into treatment.\nAs we discuss below, these forms of intervention may have the opposite\nof the desired effect, by discouraging pregnant women who use drugs\nand alcohol from seeking prenatal care (Roberts and Pies 2011).\n\nGeorge Schedler (1991, 1992) has argued that as a society we ought to\nforce pregnant women who persistently abuse drugs to have abortions.\nHe argues that harm is minimized by simply eliminating fetuses at high\nrisk for damage through maternal drug abuse. The harm of unwanted\nabortion, he claims, \u2018pales in comparison\u2019 to the\nsuffering imposed on other family members, teachers, etc. who must\nhelp care for a damaged child. He also argues that fetuses have a\nright not to be subjected to a life damaged by in utero drug exposure,\nand that reproductive autonomy does not extend to the right to bear a\nchild damaged by one's own drug use. It is integral to his argument\nthat doing drugs is a \u2018leisure activity\u2019, and hence that\nwomen morally forfeit their protection from unwanted abortion and\ntheir right to bear a child through participating in this activity.\nOne might find implausible the idea that non-existence is preferable\nto a life involving even quite severe impairments caused by in utero\ndrug exposure, and hence Schedler's argument from fetal rights is\nquestionable. Furthermore, the idea that caring for such an impaired\nchild obviously involves far more suffering than joy is disturbing.\nMoreover, Schedler does not discuss the emotional damage and the\nassault on bodily integrity and privacy involved in a forced abortion;\nhe considers only the immediate discomfort of the surgical procedure\nin factoring in the harm done to pregnant women under his\nproposal.\n\nMost commentators on the ethics of managing pregnant drug abusers have\nrejected a punitive or coercive approach (Capron 1998, Steinbock 1992,\ndeVille et al. 1998, Terplan, Kennedy-Hendricks, and Chisolm 2015).\nThe Center for Reproductive Rights published a brief in 2000\nsummarizing common arguments against punishing pregnant drug abusers.\nThey point out that punishing the mother does not particularly protect\nthe well-being of children. It is also unlikely to have a deterrent\neffect, since drug use among addicts is rarely a voluntary choice\nbased on a rational assessment of the risks and potential benefits of\ndrug use. Indeed, most pregnant addicts are not \u2018choosing\u2019\ntheir own pleasure over their children's well-being, as they would\ngenerally prefer not to be drug abusers, for their own sake as well as\ntheir child's. In addition to creating barriers to effective prenatal\ncare, punitive and coercive approaches to drug use during pregnancy\nmay inappropriately diminish women's agency and misconstrue the\ninterests of pregnant women who use drugs (Olsen, Banwell, and Madden\n2014). Threatening pregnant drug users with punishment does not serve\nto protect children from their \u201cunfit\u201d mothers, and may\ndeter women from getting prenatal care and especially drug treatment,\nthereby further harming their children (Terplan, Kennedy-Henricks and\nChisolm 2015). Furthermore, a punitive approach individualizes the\nproblem of drug use during pregnancy and ignores social determinants\nof drug addiction. Some argue that punitive measures against pregnant\nwomen addicted to drugs are inherently unjust when taken in a system\nthat fails to meet the basic health needs of marginalized women and\nchildren (Flavin and Paltrow 2010). Poor and minority pregnant women\nare disproportionately tested for drugs and threatened with\npunishment, even though they use drugs at rates no higher than their\nwhite, middle-class counterparts, and hence a punitive approach is\nlikely to be unjustly applied (see also Hans 1999). Iris Young argues,\n\u201c[b]ecause punishing the pregnant addict does next to nothing to\nprevent the birth of babies harmed by the chronic drug use of their\nmothers, punishment seems only to have the function of marking the\nwomen as deviant, publicly reaffirming their exclusion from the class\nof upstanding citizens\u201d (Young 1994, 39).\n\nIris Young (1994) distinguishes between three approaches to drug abuse\nduring pregnancy: punishment, treatment, and empowerment. She rejects\nthe punishment approach as immoral and impractical. Most critics of\nthe punitive approach advocate a treatment approach (e.g., Steinbock\n1992, DeVille et al. 1998). Young, however, has reservations about the\ntreatment approach as currently practiced; she argues that it still\ntreats addiction as an individual, medicalized health problem, rather\nthan as a social problem. An empowerment approach of the sort that\nYoung favors offers treatment, but in the context of a project of\nsocial empowerment and consciousness-raising designed to foster a\ncritically reflective \u201csense of collective influence over the\nsocial conditions of one's life\u201d (Young 1994, 48). She advocates\nprograms that help women develop a perspective from which overcoming\naddiction can be understood not just as an individual health or\nwill-power problem, but as part of a shared project of personal and\ncommunity transformation.\n",
