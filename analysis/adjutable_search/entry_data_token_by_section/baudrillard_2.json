From Pataphysics to Metaphysics and the Triumph of the Object\n\n\nBaudrillard\u2019s thought from the mid-1970s to his death in 2007\nchallenges theories in a variety of disciplines. During the 1980s, his\nmajor works of the 1970s were translated into many languages and new\nbooks of the 1980s were in turn translated into English and other major\nlanguages in short order. Consequently, he became world-renown as one\nof the most influential thinkers of postmodernity. Baudrillard became\nsomething of an academic celebrity, travelling around the world\npromoting his work and winning a significant following, though more\noutside of the field of academic theory than within his own discipline\nof sociology.\n\n\nAt the same time that his work was becoming extremely popular,\nBaudrillard\u2019s own writing became increasingly difficult and\nobscure. In 1979, he published Seduction (1990), a difficult\ntext that represented a major shift in his thought. The book marks a\nturning away from the more sociological discourse of his earlier works\nto a more philosophical and literary discourse. Whereas in Symbolic\nExchange and Death (1993a [1976]), Baudrillard sketched out\nultra-revolutionary perspectives as a radical alternative, taking\nsymbolic exchange as his ideal, he now takes seduction as his\nalternative to production and communicative interaction. Seduction,\nhowever, does not undermine, subvert, or transform existing social\nrelations or institutions, but is a soft alternative, a play with\nappearances, and a game with feminism, a provocation that provoked a\nsharp critical\n response.[7]\nBaudrillard\u2019s concept of seduction is idiosyncratic and involves\ngames with signs which set up seduction as an aristocratic \u201corder\nof sign and ritual\u201d in contrast to the bourgeois ideal of\nproduction, while advocating artifice, appearance, play, and challenge\nagainst the deadly serious labor of production. He interprets seduction\nprimarily as a ritual and game with its own rules, charms, snares, and\nlures. His writing mutates at this point into a neo-aristocratic\naestheticism dedicated to stylized modes of thought and writing, which\npresent a set of categories \u2014 reversibility, the challenge, the\nduel, \u2014 that move Baudrillard\u2019s thought toward a form of\naristocratic aestheticism and metaphysics.\n\n\nBaudrillard\u2019s proliferating metaphysical speculations are\nevident in Fatal Strategies (1983, translated in 1990),\nanother turning point in his career. This text presented a bizarre\nmetaphysical scenario concerning the triumph of objects over subjects\nwithin the \u201cobscene\u201d proliferation of an object world so\ncompletely out of control that it surpasses all attempts to understand,\nconceptualize and control it. His scenario concerns the proliferation\nand growing supremacy of objects over subjects and the eventual triumph\nof the object. In a discussion of \u201cEcstasy and Inertia,\u201d\nBaudrillard discusses how objects and events in contemporary society\nare continually surpassing themselves, growing and expanding in power.\nThe \u201cecstasy\u201d of objects is their great proliferation and\nexpansion; ecstasy as going outside of or beyond oneself: the beautiful\nas more beautiful than beautiful in fashion, the real more real than\nthe real in television, sex more sexual than sex in pornography.\nEcstasy is thus the form of obscenity (fully explicit, nothing hidden)\nand of the hyperreality described by Baudrillard earlier taken to\nanother level, redoubled and intensified. His vision of contemporary\nsociety exhibits a careening of growth and excrescence\n(croissance et excroissance), expanding and excreting ever\nmore goods, services, information, messages or demands \u2014\nsurpassing all rational ends and boundaries in a spiral of uncontrolled\ngrowth and replication.\n\n\nYet growth, acceleration, and proliferation have reached such\nextremes, Baudrillard suggests, that the ecstasy of excrescence (i.e.,\nincreasing numbers of goods) is accompanied by inertia. The process of\ngrowth presents a catastrophe for the subject, for not only does the\nacceleration and proliferation of the object world intensify the\naleatory dimension of chance and non-determinacy, but the objects\nthemselves come to dominate the exhausted subject, whose fascination\nwith the play of objects turns to apathy, stupefaction, and\ninertia.\n\n\nIn retrospect, the growing power of the world of objects over the\nsubject has been Baudrillard\u2019s theme from the beginning, thus\npointing to an underlying continuity in his project. In his early\nwritings, he explored the ways that commodities were fascinating\nindividuals in the consumer society and the ways that the world of\ngoods was assuming new and more value through the agency of sign value\nand the code \u2014 which were part of the world of things, the system\nof objects. His polemics against Marxism were fuelled by the belief\nthat sign value and the code were more fundamental than such\ntraditional elements of political economy as exchange value, use value,\nproduction and so on in constituting contemporary society. Then,\nreflections on the media entered the forefront of his thought: the TV\nobject was at the center of the home in Baudrillard\u2019s earlier\nthinking and the media, simulations, hyperreality, and implosion\neventually came to obliterate distinctions between private and public,\ninside and outside, media and reality. Henceforth, everything was\npublic, transparent, and hyperreal in the object world that was gaining\nin fascination and seductiveness as the years went by.\n\n\nIn Fatal Strategies and succeeding writings, the object\ndominates or \u201cdefeats\u201d the subject. The \u201cfatal\nstrategies\u201d suggest that individuals should simply submit to the\nstrategies and ruses of objects. In \u201cbanal strategies,\u201d\n\u201cthe subject believes itself to always be more clever than the\nobject, whereas in the other [fatal strategies] the object is always\nsupposed to be more shrewd, more cynical, more brilliant than the\nsubject\u201d (1983: 259\u2013260). Previously, in banal strategies, the\nsubject believed itself to be more masterful and sovereign than the\nobject. A fatal strategy, by contrast, recognizes the supremacy of the\nobject and therefore takes the side of the object and surrenders to its\nstrategies, ruses and rules.\n\n\nIn these works, Baudrillard seems to be taking his theory into the\nrealm of metaphysics, but it is a specific type of metaphysics deeply\ninspired by the pataphysics developed by Alfred Jarry. For Jarry:\n\n\n\npataphysics is the science of the realm beyond metaphysics\u2026\nIt will study the laws which govern exceptions and will explain the\nuniverse supplementary to this one; or, less ambitiously, it will\ndescribe a universe which one can see \u2014 must see perhaps \u2014\ninstead of the traditional one\u2026\n\n\n\n\nDefinition: pataphysics is the science of imaginary solutions, which\nsymbolically attributes the properties of objects, described by their\nvirtuality, to their lineaments (Jarry 1963: 131).\n\n\n\nLike the universe in Jarry\u2019s Ubu Roi, The\nGestures and Opinions of Doctor Faustroll (1969), and other\nliterary texts \u2014 as well as in Jarry\u2019s more theoretical\nexplications of pataphysics \u2014 Baudrillard\u2019s is a totally\nabsurd universe where objects rule in mysterious ways, and people and\nevents are governed by absurd and ultimately unknowable\ninterconnections and predestination (The French playwright Eugene\nIonesco is another good source of entry to this universe). Like\nJarry\u2019s pataphysics, Baudrillard\u2019s universe is ruled by\nsurprise, reversal, hallucination, blasphemy, obscenity, and a desire\nto shock and outrage.\n\n\nThus, in view of the growing supremacy of the object, Baudrillard\nwants us to abandon the subject and to side with the object.\nPataphysics aside, it seems that Baudrillard is trying to end the\nphilosophy of subjectivity that has controlled French thought since\nDescartes by going over completely to the other side. Descartes\u2019\nmalin genie, his evil genius, was a ruse of the subject that\ntried to seduce him into accepting what was not clear and distinct, but\nover which he was ultimately able to prevail. Baudrillard\u2019s\n\u201cevil genius\u201d is the object itself which is much worse than\nthe merely epistemological deceptions of the subject faced by Descartes\nand which constitutes a fatal destiny that demands the end of the\nphilosophy of subjectivity. Henceforth, for Baudrillard, people live in\nthe era of the reign of the object.\n",
