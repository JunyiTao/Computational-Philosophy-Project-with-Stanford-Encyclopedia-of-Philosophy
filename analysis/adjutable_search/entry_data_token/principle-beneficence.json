The Concepts of Beneficence and Benevolence\n\n\nThe term beneficence connotes acts or personal qualities of\nmercy, kindness, generosity, and charity. It is suggestive of altruism,\nlove, humanity, and promoting the good of others. In ordinary language,\nthe notion is broad, but it is understood even more broadly in ethical\ntheory to include effectively all norms, dispositions, and actions with\nthe goal of benefiting or promoting the good of other persons. The\nlanguage of a principle or rule of beneficence refers\nto a normative statement of a moral obligation to act for the others\u2019\nbenefit, helping them to further their important and legitimate\ninterests, often by preventing or removing possible harms. Many\ndimensions of applied ethics appear to incorporate such appeals to\nobligatory beneficence, even if only implicitly. For example, when\napparel manufacturers are criticized for not having good labor\npractices in factories, the ultimate goal of the criticisms is usually\nto obtain better working conditions, wages, and other benefits for\nworkers.\n\n\nWhereas beneficence refers to actions or rules aimed at\nbenefiting others, benevolence refers to the morally valuable\ncharacter trait\u2014or virtue\u2014of being disposed to act to\nbenefit others. Many acts of beneficence have been understood in moral\ntheory as obligatory, as determined by principles of\nbeneficence that state moral obligation. However, beneficent acts\nalso may be performed from nonobligatory, optional moral\nideals, which are standards that belong to a morality of\nmeritorious aspiration in which individuals or institutions adopt goals\nand practices that are not obligatory for everyone.\n\n\nExceptional beneficence is commonly categorized as\nsupererogatory, a term meaning paying or performing beyond\nwhat is obligatory or doing more than is required. This category of\nextraordinary conduct usually refers to high moral ideals of action,\nbut it has links to virtues and to Aristotelian ideals of moral\nexcellence. Such ideals of action and moral excellence of character\nneed not rise to the level of the moral saint or moral hero. Moral\nexcellence comes by degrees, and not all supererogatory acts of\nbeneficence or benevolent dispositions are exceptionally arduous,\ncostly, or risky. Examples of less demanding forms include anonymous\ngift-giving, uncompensated public service, forgiving another person\u2019s\ncostly error, and complying with requests to provide a benefit that\nexceeds the obligatory requirements of ordinary morality or\nprofessional morality.\n\n\nIt is generally agreed that ordinary morality does not require\nbeneficent acts that involve severe sacrifice or maximum altruism, such\nas a physician\u2019s putting herself, without protective drugs and\nequipment, in a life-threatening condition in an epidemic in order to\nprovide medical care. Such extraordinary beneficent conduct\ntypically derives from moral ideals rather than norms of obligation,\nalthough the line between obligations of beneficence and ideals of\nbeneficence is often difficult to draw. Saintly and heroic beneficence\n(and benevolence) are at the outermost end of a continuum of beneficent\nconduct and commitment. This continuum is not merely a continuum\nmapping the territory beyond duty (supererogation). It is a\ncontinuum of beneficence itself, starting with weak obligatory\nbeneficence (e.g., helping a stranger with mild disabilities enter a\nroom with an extremely heavy door) and then moving on to strong\nobligatory beneficence (such as rescuing a person in danger when the\ndanger is not severe for the rescuer). The continuum of obligation is\nthe first half of the continuum, which runs from weak obligations\n(e.g., such as conscientiousness in attending to a friend\u2019s welfare) to\nstrict obligation (as in the obligation to aid someone sitting next to\nyou who has been injured in an automobile accident when you have not\nbeen injured). The continuum then moves to the domain of ideals of\nbeneficence that are morally nonrequired, exceptionally virtuous, and\nthe like. An absence of any level of obligatory beneficence\u2014from\nweak to strong\u2014constitutes a defect in the moral life. But a\nfailure to perform high-level acts of supererogation such as heroic\nacts of self-sacrifice to benefit others cannot be accounted a defect.\nBeneficence is best understood as spread across this full continuum,\ndespite the considerable controversy that exists about where obligation\nends and supererogation begins on the continuum.\n\n\nA celebrated example of beneficence that rests somewhere on this\ncontinuum, and yet is controversial and difficult to locate just where\non the continuum, is the New Testament parable of the Good Samaritan.\nIn this parable, robbers have beaten and left half-dead a man traveling\nfrom Jerusalem to Jericho. A Samaritan tends to his wounds and cares\nfor him at an inn. The Samaritan\u2019s actions are beneficent and the\nmotives benevolent. However, they do not seem\u2014on the information\ngiven\u2014to rise to the level of heroic or saintly conduct. The\nmorally exceptional, beneficent person may be laudable and emulable,\nyet neither a moral saint nor a moral hero.\n2. The Place of Beneficence in the History of Ethical Theory\n\n\nThe history of ethical theory shows that there are many ways to\nthink about beneficence and benevolence. Several landmark ethical\ntheories have embraced these moral notions as central categories, while\nproposing strikingly different conceptual and moral analyses. Prime\nexamples are found in the moral-sentiment theory of David Hume, where\nbenevolence is the central \u201cprinciple\u201d of human nature in\nhis moral psychology, and in utilitarian theories such as John Stuart\nMill\u2019s, where the principle of utility is itself a strong and\nvery demanding normative principle of beneficence. In these writers\nbeneficence is close to the essence of morality. Other writers,\nincluding Kant, have given less ascendency to beneficence, but still\ngive it a central place in morality.\n2.1 Hume\u2019s Theory\n\n\nHume\u2019s moral psychology and virtue ethics make motives of\nbenevolence all important in moral life. He argues that natural\nbenevolence accounts, in great part, for what he calls the origin of\nmorality. A major theme is his defense of benevolence as a principle in\nhuman nature, in opposition to theories of psychological egoism. Much\nin Hume\u2019s moral theory is directed against Bernard Mandeville\u2019s (and\nlikely Hobbes\u2019s) theory that the motive underlying human action is\nprivate interest and that humans are naturally neither sociable nor\nbenevolent. Hume argues that egoism rests on a faulty moral psychology\nand maintains that benevolence is an \u201coriginal\u201d feature of\nhuman nature. Benevolence is Hume\u2019s most important moral principle of\nhuman nature, but he also uses the term \u201cbenevolence\u201d to\ndesignate a class of virtues rooted in goodwill, generosity, and love\ndirected at others. Hume finds benevolence in many manifestations:\nfriendship, charity, compassion, etc. Although he speaks of both\nbenevolence and justice as social virtues, only benevolence is a\nconstitutive principle of human nature. Rules of justice, by\ncontrast, are normative human conventions that promote public utility.\nThe virtues of benevolence and justice are therefore extraordinarily\ndifferent virtues in Hume\u2019s ethics.\n\n\nIn his inquiries into the principle of self-love, Hume does not\nreject all aspects of the egoists\u2019 claims about the absence of\nimpartial benevolence in human motivation. He acknowledges many motives\nin human nature and uses metaphors of the dove, wolf, and serpent to\nillustrate the mixture of elements in our nature. Principally, he sees\nhuman nature in the domain of moral conduct as a mixture of benevolence\nand self-love. Whereas the egoist views human nature as limited to\nmotives such as survival, fear, ambition, and the search for happiness,\nHume regards persons as motivated by a variety of passions, both\ngenerous and ungenerous. He maintains that these elements vary by\ndegree from person to person. Lacking distinctive information about a\nparticular individual, we cannot know whether in that person\nbenevolence typically dominates and controls self-love, or the\nconverse.\n2.2 Mill\u2019s Theory\n\n\nIn Utilitarianism, John Stuart Mill argues that moral\nphilosophers have left a train of unconvincing and incompatible\ntheories that can be coherently unified by a single standard of\nbeneficence that allows us to decide objectively what is right and\nwrong. He declares the principle of utility, or the \u201cgreatest\nhappiness\u201d principle, to be the basic foundation of morals:\nActions are right in proportion to their promotion of happiness for all\nbeings, and wrong as they produce the reverse. This is a\nstraightforward principle of beneficence and potentially a very\ndemanding one. Mill and subsequent utilitarians mean that an action or\npractice is right (when compared with any alternative action or\npractice) if it leads to the greatest possible balance of\nbeneficial consequences (happiness for Mill) or to the least\npossible balance of bad consequences (unhappiness for Mill). Mill\nalso holds that the concepts of duty, obligation, and right are\nsubordinated to, and determined by, that which maximizes benefits and\nminimizes harmful outcomes. The principle of utility is presented by\nMill as an absolute principle, thereby making beneficence the one and\nonly supreme or preeminent principle of ethics. It justifies all\nsubordinate rules and is not simply one among a number of basic\nprinciples.\n\n\nMill\u2019s theory of morality is welfare-oriented at its core because\nmoral rightness is determined by goodness, which is itself to be\nunderstood in terms of the welfare of individuals. It is a\nconsequentialist theory because the moral rightness and obligatoriness\nof actions are established by their beneficial results. It is an\naggregative theory because a judgment about right or obligatory action\ndepends on an appraisal of the effects of different possible actions on\nthe welfare of all affected parties, which entails summing positive\nbenefits and negative effects over all persons affected. Beneficence\nhas rarely occupied such a central role in a moral theory.\n2.3 Kant\u2019s Theory\n\n\nKant rejects the utilitarian model of a supreme principle of\nbeneficence, but he still finds a vital place in the moral life for\nbeneficence. He seeks universally valid principles (or maxims) of duty,\nand beneficence is one such principle. A motive of benevolence based on\nsentiment\u2014highly admired by Hume\u2014is morally unworthy in\nKant\u2019s theory unless the motive behind benevolent action is a motive of\nduty. The motive likewise cannot rest on utilitarian goals.\n\n\nKant argues that everyone has a duty to be beneficent, i.e. to be\nhelpful to others according to one\u2019s means, and without hoping for any\nform of personal gain thereby. Benevolence done from friendly\ninclination he regards as \u201cunlimited\u201d (a term subject to\ndifferent interpretations, but meaning at least \u201chaving no\nboundaries in potential scope\u201d), whereas beneficence from duty\ndoes not place unlimited demands on persons. Nonetheless, the limits of\nduties of beneficence are not clear and precise in Kant. While we are\nobligated to some extent to sacrifice some part of our welfare to\nbenefit others without any expectation of recompense, it is not\npossible in the abstract to fix a definite limit on how far this duty\nextends. We can only say that everyone has a duty to be beneficent,\naccording to that person\u2019s means, and that no one has an unlimited duty\nto do so.\n\n\nKant here anticipates, without developing, what would later become\none of the most difficult areas of the theory of beneficence: How,\nexactly, are we to specify the limits of beneficence as an obligation?\nNeither Kant, Hume, nor Mill has a precise answer to this question.\n3. Is Beneficent Action Obligatory or Merely a Moral Ideal?\n\n\nAs discussion above about the continuum of beneficence indicates,\ndeep disagreements have emerged in moral theory regarding how much is\ndemanded by obligations of beneficence. Some ethical theories insist\nnot only that there are obligations of beneficence, but that these\nobligations sometimes demand severe sacrifice and extreme generosity in\nthe moral life. Some formulations of utilitarianism, for example,\nappear to derive obligations to give our job to a person who needs it\nmore than we do, to give away most of our income, to devote much of our\ntime to civic enterprises, etc. It is likely that no society has ever\noperated on such a demanding principle, but it does seem embraced, at\nleast abstractly, by a number of moral philosophers\u2014arguably even\nin Kant\u2019s theory of the categorical imperative (although, as previously\nmentioned, Kant seems to deny such scope to obligatory\nbeneficence).\n\n\nBy contrast, some moral philosophers have claimed that we have no\ngeneral obligations of beneficence. We have only duties of beneficence\nthat derive from specific roles and assignments of duty that are not a\npart of ordinary morality. These philosophers hold that beneficent\naction is virtuous and a commendable moral ideal, but not an\nobligation, and thus that persons are not morally deficient if they\nfail to act beneficently. An instructive example is found in the moral\ntheory of Bernard Gert, who maintains that there are no moral rules of\nbeneficence, only moral ideals. The only obligations in the moral life,\napart from duties encountered in professional roles and other specific\nstations of duty, are captured by moral rules that prohibit causing\nharm or evil. In Gert\u2019s theory, the general goal of morality is to\nminimize the causation of evil or harm, not to promote good. Rational\npersons morally should act impartially at all times in regard to all\npersons with the aim of not causing evil, he argues, but rational\npersons are not morally required to act impartially to promote the good\nfor all persons at all times.\n\n\nThose who defend such a beneficence-negating conclusion (regarding\nobligation) do not hold the extreme view that there are no obligations\nof beneficence in contexts of role-assigned duties such as those in\nprofessional ethics and in specific communities. They acknowledge that\nprofessional and other roles carry obligations (or duties, as Gert\nprefers) that do not bind persons who do not occupy the relevant roles.\nThey claim that the actions one is obligated to perform within the\nroles are merely moral ideals for any person who is not in the specific\nrole. That is, these philosophers present beneficence not as a general\nobligation, but as a role-specific duty and as institutionally or\nculturally assigned.\n\n\nIn rejecting principles of obligatory beneficence, Gert draws the\nline of obligations by presenting a sharp contrast between beneficence\nand nonmaleficence. That is, he embraces rules of obligation that\nprohibit causing harm to other persons, even though he rejects\nas obligatory all principles or rules that require helping\nother persons, which includes acting to prevent harm to them.\nAccordingly, he accepts moral rules such as \u201cDon\u2019t kill,\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t cause pain or suffering to others,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t\nincapacitate others,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t deprive others of the goods of\nlife,\u201d and the like. His theory therefore makes nonmaleficence\ncentral to his theory of moral obligation while denying that\nbeneficence has a place in the theory of obligation.\n\n\nHowever, the mainstream of moral philosophy makes both not-harming\nand helping to be obligations, while preserving the distinction between\nthe two. This literature can be confusing, because some writers treat\nobligations of nonmaleficence as a species of obligations of\nbeneficence, although the two notions are very different. Rules of\nbeneficence are typically more demanding than rules of nonmaleficence,\nand rules of nonmaleficence are negative prohibitions of action that\nmust be followed impartially and that provide moral reasons for legal\nprohibitions of certain forms of conduct. By contrast, rules of\nbeneficence state positive requirements of action, need not always be\nfollowed impartially, and rarely, if ever, provide moral reasons that\nsupport legal punishment when agents fail to abide by the rules.\n\n\nThe contrast between nonmaleficence and beneficence notwithstanding,\nordinary morality suggests that there are some rules of\nbeneficence that we are obligated to follow impartially, such as those\nrequiring that we make efforts to rescue strangers under conditions of\nminimal risk to ourselves. Even some legal punishments (as they exist\nin some legal jurisdictions) for failure to rescue strangers may be\njustifiable. Significant controversies have arisen in both law and\nmoral philosophy about how to formulate and defend such requirements,\nbut one influential idea has been to argue that a person P has an\nobligation of beneficence to help another whenever the other is at risk\nof significant loss of or damage to some basic interest; P\u2019s action is\nnecessary (singly or collaboratively) to prevent this loss or damage;\nP\u2019s action (singly or collaboratively) is likely to prevent the loss or\ndamage; and P\u2019s action does not present significant risks, costs, or\nburdens to P while the benefits that the rescued person can be expected\nto gain outweigh any burden that P is likely to incur.\n4. The Problem of Over-Demanding Beneficence\n\n\nSome philosophers defend extremely demanding and far-reaching\nprinciples of obligatory beneficence. Peter Singer\u2019s theory has been\nthe most widely discussed account. Singer has throughout his career\nbeen interested in how to reduce the evils of global harm and\nsuffering in the most effective manner. In his early work, Singer\ndistinguished between preventing evil and promoting good and contended\nthat persons in prosperous nations are morally obligated to prevent\nsomething bad or evil from happening if it is in their power to do so\nwithout having to sacrifice anything of comparable importance. The\nargument is that serious shortages of housing, food, and healthcare\nare harmful to human life and welfare and are preventable. If person P\nhas some capacity to prevent these evils\u2014for example, by\ndonation to aid agencies\u2014without loss of comparable item(s) of\nimportance, P acts unethically by not contributing to the alleviation\nof these shortages. Accordingly, in the face of preventable disease\nand poverty we are morally obligated to donate time or resources\ntoward their eradication until we reach a level at which, by giving\nmore, we would cause as much suffering to ourselves as we would\nrelieve through our gift. This demanding principle of beneficence\nrequires us to invest heavily in rescuing needy persons in the global\npopulation; merely donating at the level of local communities and\nnation states is insufficient. However, Singer leaves it open what\ncounts as being of comparable importance and as being an appropriate\nlevel of sacrifice.\n\n\nSinger\u2019s principle implies that morality sometimes requires us\nto make enormous sacrifices. The demand is placed not only on\nindividuals with disposable incomes, but on all reasonably well-off\npersons, foundations, governments, corporations, etc. All parties have\nmoral obligations to refrain from spending resources on nonessential\nitems and to use the available resources or savings to lend assistance\nto those in urgent need. Frills, fashion, luxuries, and the like are\nnever to determine expenditures, and one is to give to the needy up to\nthe point that one (or one\u2019s dependent) would be impoverished. Singer\ndoes not regard such conduct as an enormous moral sacrifice, but only\nas the discharge of a basic obligation of beneficence.\n\n\nSinger\u2019s proposals have struck many as overly demanding,\nimpracticable, and a significant departure from the demands of ordinary\nmorality. This assessment has generated a number of criticisms, as well\nas defenses, of demanding principles of beneficence such as the one he\nproposes. Critics argue that a principle of beneficence that requires\npersons, governments, and corporations to seriously disrupt their\nprojects and plans in order to benefit the poor and underprivileged\nexceeds the demands of ordinary moral obligations and has no plausible\ngrounding in normative moral theory about obligations. They argue that\nthe line between the obligatory and the supererogatory has been\nunjustifiably erased by such a principle. In effect, the claim is that\nSinger\u2019s aspirational moral ideal is an attempt to redraw\nestablished lines in morality that distinguish between moral obligation\nand supererogatory moral ideals.\n\n\nIn response to criticism Singer has attempted to reformulate his\nposition so that his theory of beneficence does not set an overly\ndemanding standard. He maintains that no clear justification exists for\nthe claim that obligations of ordinary morality do not contain a\ndemanding principle of beneficence, in particular a strong\nharm-prevention principle. He apparently would explain the lack of\nconcern often shown for poverty relief as a failure to draw the correct\nimplications from the very principles of beneficence that ordinary\nmorality embraces and that utilitarian moral theory justifies. Later in\nhis series of publications on the subject, Singer has attempted to take\naccount of objections that his principle sets an unduly high standard.\nHe has not given up his strong principle of beneficence, but he has\nsuggested that it might be morally wise and most productive to\npublicly advocate a lower standard\u2014that is, a weakened\nprinciple of beneficence. He therefore has proposed a more guarded\nformulation of the principle, arguing that we should strive for\ndonations of a percentage of income, such as 10 per cent, which amounts\nto more than a token donation and yet also is not so high as to make us\nmiserable or turn us into moral saints. This standard, Singer suggests,\nis the minimum that we ought to do to conform to obligations of\nbeneficence.\n\n\nControversy continues in philosophy about how to analyze and\nevaluate the commitments of a principle of beneficence, including how\nto formulate limits that reduce required burdens on agents\u2019 life plans\nand make meeting the obligations of beneficence a realistic\npossibility. Various writers have noted that even after many persons\nhave donated generous portions of their income, they could still donate\nmore while living decent lives; and, according a strong principle of\nbeneficence demands that they should donate more. Recent ethical theory\nshows that establishing the theoretical and practical standards of\ndonation and sacrifice is challenging, and perhaps an impossible\nideal.\n\n\nHowever, it does not follow that we should give up a principle of\nbeneficence. It only follows that establishing the moral limits of the\ndemands of beneficence is profoundly difficult. Liam Murphy has\ndiscussed a number of \u201climited principles of beneficence\u201d\nand has proposed to fix the limits of individual beneficence to meet\nglobal problems of need by using a cooperative principle of fairness in\nwhich, in any given circumstance, it must first be determined what each\nreasonably affluent person must do to contribute a fair share to an\noptimal outcome. An individual is only required to aid others\nbeneficently at the level that would produce the best consequences if\nall in society were to give their fair share. One is not required to do\nmore even if others fail to act on their fair-share obligations of\nbeneficence, and it would be an unfair imposition of responsibility to\nask more of them. Unlike act-consequentialism, this theory does not\ndemand more of agents when non-complying agents fail to do their\npart.\n\n\nMurphy\u2019s cooperative principle is intuitively attractive, but it may\nnot have the necessary moral punch to address issues such as global\npoverty. Murphy seems right to suggest that large-scale problems\nrequiring beneficence should be conceived as cooperative projects, but\nhis limit on individual obligations seems unlikely to have a practical\neffect of increasing international aid and the like beyond present\ncommitments and levels. If, as is to be expected in virtually all\nsituations of global poverty, others fail to comply with their\nfair-share obligations of beneficence as set out in this demanding\ntheory, it is not clear why each person\u2019s obligation is set only by the\noriginal calculation of a single fair share. This is not to say that\nSinger\u2019s approach is superior. The more demanding a principle is, the\nless likely are people to comply with its demands. Also, at an\nintuitive level, Murphy seems right that an individual\u2019s obligations of\nbeneficence should not increase to fill gaps merely because others are\nfailing to meet their obligations.\n\n\nSinger has defended his arguments about beneficence, with a somewhat\nsympathetic response to Murphy. Singer seems concerned with which\nsocial conditions will motivate people to give, rather than\nwith attempting to determine obligations of beneficence with precision.\nHe responds to critics such as Murphy by conceding that perhaps the\nlimit we should publicly advocate as a level of giving is no\nmore than a person\u2019s fair share of what is needed to relieve poverty\nand the like. Unless we draw the line here, we might not be able to\nmotivate people to give at all. A fair share seems to be a lower\nthreshold of one\u2019s obligations than the obligations Singer originally\nenvisaged, but more realistic. The emphasis on motivation is presumably\nintended to provide a more subtle and convincing approach to increasing\ncharitable donations even though the nature and limits of beneficence\nshould be set by his utilitarian moral theory, as he has always\nproposed.\n\n\nWherever the line of precise limits of obligatory beneficence is\ndrawn, the line is likely to be revisionary of ordinary morality.\nSinger\u2019s proposals, unlike Murphy\u2019s, represent a revision of ordinary\nmorality\u2019s requirements of beneficence. A variety of proposals\nregarding the limits of beneficence have been made by philosophers, but\nno agreement exists on even a single general principle. Given this\nsituation, some now doubt that ethical theory and practical\ndeliberation are equipped to establish precise conditions and limits of\nobligations of beneficence, especially when confronting problems of\nglobal poverty.\n5. Liberty-Limiting Beneficence: The Problem of Benefit Paternalism\n\n\nA much-discussed issue about beneficence descends historically from\nMill\u2019s On Liberty, where Mill inquired into the nature and\nlimits of justifiable social control over the individual. He argues\nthat the measure of a person\u2019s liberty\u2014or personal\nautonomy\u2014is the measure of the person\u2019s independence from\ninfluences that control the person\u2019s preferences, thoughts, and\nbehavior. Various principles commonly assumed to be moral\nprinciples have been advanced to justify the limitation of individual\nliberties. Joel Feinberg, who was philosophically close to various of\nMill\u2019s views, appropriately called these principles\n\u201cliberty-limiting principles.\u201d Mill defended the view that\nonly one principle validly limits liberty. Feinberg called it the\nharm principle: A person\u2019s liberty (or autonomy) is justifiably\nrestricted to prevent harm to others caused by that person. Feinberg\nagreed with Mill that the principle of paternalism, which\nrenders acceptable certain acts intended to benefit another person when\nthe other does not prefer to receive the benefit, is not a morally\nacceptable liberty-limiting principle.\n\n\nThe term paternalism has its roots in the notion of\npaternal administration\u2014government as by a father to administer\nin the way a beneficent father raises his children. The analogy with\nthe father presupposes two features of the paternal role: that the\nfather acts beneficently (that is, in accordance with the interests of\nhis children) and that he makes all or at least some of the decisions\nrelating to his children\u2019s welfare, rather than leaving them free to\nmake those decisions. On this model, \u201cpaternalism\u201d may be\ndefined as the intentional overriding of one person\u2019s known preferences\nor choices by another person, where the person who overrides justifies\nthe action by the goal of substantially benefiting or avoiding harm to\nthe person whose preferences or choices are overridden. (Both\n\u201cbenefiting\u201d and \u201cavoiding harm\u201d can generally,\nthough not always, be understood as forms of beneficence.) An act of\npaternalism, then, overrides moral obligations to respect autonomous\nchoice on grounds of beneficence.\n\n\nPhilosophers divide sharply over whether some restricted form of\npaternalism can be justified and, if so, on what basis. One plausible\nbeneficence-based justification of paternalistic actions places\nbenefits on a scale with autonomy interests and balances the two: As a\nperson\u2019s interests in autonomy increase and the benefits for that\nperson decrease, the justification of paternalistic action becomes less\ncogent; conversely, as the benefits for a person increase and that\nperson\u2019s interests in autonomy decrease, the justification of\npaternalistic action becomes more plausible. In this account preventing\nminor harms or providing minor benefits while deeply disrespecting\nautonomy lacks plausible justification; but actions that prevent major\nharms or provide major benefits while only trivially disrespecting\nautonomy have a plausible paternalistic rationale.\n\n\nThough no consensus exists over the justification of paternalism,\nvirtually no one thinks that benefit paternalism can be justified\nunless at least the following conditions are\nsatisfied:\n\nA person is at risk of a substantial and preventable harm or loss\nof a benefit.\nThe paternalistic action has a strong likelihood of preventing the\nharm or obtaining the benefit.\nThe projected benefits of the paternalistic action outweigh its\nrisks.\nThe least autonomy-restrictive alternative that will secure the\nbenefits or reduce the risks is implemented.\n\n\n\nDebates about benefit paternalism have also emerged in public policy\ncontexts. Often health policies have the goal of avoiding a harm or\nproviding a benefit in a population in which most affected parties are\nnot consulted. Some percentage of the population will not support the\npolicy because they are given no choice in the matter, whereas others\nwill approve the policy. In effect, the policy is intended to benefit\nall members of a population without consulting the specific preferences\nof the individuals affected\u2014all the while foreseeing that many\nindividuals will in fact reject the imposed control that the policy\nexerts over their lives.\n\n\nSo-called libertarian paternalists (or neopaternalists), principally\nthe team of Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler, have argued for\ngovernment and other institutional policies intended to protect or\nbenefit individuals through shaping, steering, or nudging their choices\nwithout altogether disallowing or coercing those choices. These writers\nrecommend policies developed by public and private institutions to\n\u201cnudge\u201d people to the advancement of their welfare without\ncoercively making them to do so, while purportedly preserving their\nautonomy. These policies pursue values that an intended beneficiary\nallegedly already holds, at least implicitly, but does not realize\nbecause of limited capacities, limited resources, or limited\nself-control. Here the individual\u2019s own stated preferences,\nchoices, or actions are deemed unreasonable in light of other\nvalues the person is believed to embrace. Since they already embrace\nthese values, their autonomy is not violated despite the paternalism at\nwork.\n\n\nThis conception must confront two major problems: The first is\nconceptual. It is head-scratching how a libertarian can be a\npaternalist in the standard senses of these terms. Genuine libertarians\nfirmly support freedom of choice, freedom of contract, and the like,\nwhich seems to lack any firm support in \u201clibertarian\npaternalism.\u201d Second, what an informed and competent person\nchooses to do generally supplies the evidence of his or her true\nvalues, not some hidden value that contradicts what they choose. For\nexample, if a politically conservative man fails in one election to\nsupport the platform of a party whose platform he has always wholly\nsupported and has often said he will always support, he seems in some\nrespect committed to his party\u2019s platform, but his departure from\nthe platform in this case seems to be the best evidence we have of his\ntrue values now on the particular matter of which political positions\nhe supports. It would be improper to assert that he supports the\ncurrent platform of the party he has always supported in the past.\nSimilarly, a justified paternalism must have adequate evidence of any\nassumption it makes about an individual\u2019s deepest beliefs or\nhopes and whether they are misguided in any given case.\n6. Beneficence in Biomedical Ethics\n\n\nSince the late 1970s, principles of beneficence have been a mainstay\nof the literature of biomedical ethics. Persons engaged in medical\npractice, research, and public health appreciate that risks of harm\npresented by interventions must often be weighed against possible\nbenefits for patients, subjects, and the public. Their professional\nobligations are deeply informed by their commitments to prevent or\nreduce harm and to produce a positive balance of goods over inflicted\nharms.\n6.1 Biomedical Research Ethics\n\nThe principle of beneficence plays a foundational role in the\nframework of research ethics and federal regulations in the United\nStates (and beyond). This principle\u2019s prominence is\nhistorically traceable to the publication of the Belmont\nReport in 1978 by The National Commission for the Protection of\nHuman Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research. The Belmont\nReport has provided the basic moral framework for research ethics\nin the United States. This commission was established in 1974 by the\nU.S. Congress with a charge to discover and publish the basic\nprinciples of human research ethics and also to \"consider\" the\nboundaries between biomedical research and accepted medical practice.\nThe commission found that beneficence is one of only three basic\nprinciples of research ethics. This principle soon became and remains\ntoday one of three canonical principles in American research ethics\ngoverning research funded by the federal government.\n\n\nThe three basic principles are (1) respect for persons, (2)\nbeneficence, and (3) justice. In this context, the principle of\nbeneficence is understood as an abstract norm that includes derivative\nrules such as \"Do no harm,\" \"Balance benefits against risks,\" and\n\"Maximize possible benefits and minimize possible harms.\" This\nprinciple is satisfied in the research context by intentionally\nrefraining from causing injury and by assuring that risks stand in\nreasonable relation to probable benefits. As one major demand of\nbeneficence, the National Commission required that during the course of\nthe ethical review of research protocols there be arrayals of data\npertaining to benefits and risks and of alternative ways of obtaining\nthe benefits (if any) sought in the research. It also demanded that\nsystematic and nonarbitrary presentations of risks and benefits be made\nto subjects, as part of the informed consent process, and that\nassessments of risks and safeguards be considered by ethics committees\nwhen they evaluate whether research protocols are justified.\nThe National Commission demanded that, to fulfill obligations of\nbeneficence, research subjects not be asked or allowed to consent to\nmore risk than is warranted by anticipated benefits and that forms of\nrisk incommensurate with participants\u2019 previous experience not be\nimposed in the case of groups such as children. The moral concern is\nthat some subjects, notably children, would be overburdened and\npossibly disturbed or terrified. However, the commission recognized\nthat risks must be permitted during the course of many forms of\nresearch, including pediatric research, in order for investigators to\nbe positioned to distinguish harmful from beneficial outcomes. Today,\nthe problem might be expressed in terms of the need for investigators\nto determine the safety or effectiveness of a therapy or diagnostic\ntool under investigation in a study.\nThis understanding of beneficence and its role in protecting human\nsubjects is deeply embedded at the core of research ethics in many\ncountries.\n6.2 The Ends of Medicine\n\n\nBeneficence has played a major role in a central conceptual issue\nabout the nature and goals of medicine as a social practice. If the end\nof clinical medicine is healing, which is a goal of beneficence, then\narguably medicine is fundamentally a beneficent undertaking, and\nbeneficence grounds and determines the professional obligations and\nvirtues of the physician. Authors such as Edmund Pellegrino write as if\nbeneficence is the sole foundational principle of professional medical\nethics. In this theory, medical beneficence is oriented exclusively to\nthe end of healing and not to any other form of benefit. The category\nof medical benefits does not, for Pellegrino, include items such as\nproviding fertility controls (unless for the prevention and maintenance\nof health and bodily integrity), performing purely cosmetic surgery, or\nactively helping a patient to effect a merciful death by the active\nhastening of death.\n\n\nThis characterization of the ends of medicine allows Pellegrino to\nlimit severely what counts as a medical benefit for patients: Benefit\nin medicine is limited to healing and related activities such as caring\nfor and preventing injury or disease. This thesis is controversial.\nEven if healing and the like are interpreted broadly, medicine does not\nseem to many in bioethics to have such precise boundaries. If\nbeneficence is a general moral principle and if physicians are\npositioned to supply many forms of benefit, there is no manifest reason\nwhy physicians\u2019 hands are tied to the single benefit of\nhealing, even in their role as medical professionals. The\nrange of benefits that might be considered relevant seems broader and\ncould include prescribing pharmaceutical products or devices that\nprevent fertility (where there is no healing-related purpose),\nproviding cosmetic surgery for strictly aesthetic (by contrast to\nreconstructive) reasons, helping patients write realistic living wills,\ncomplying with terminally ill patients\u2019 requests for\nphysician-assistance in dying by hastening death, and the like. If\nthese are bona fide medical benefits, how far does the range of\nbenefits extend? If a physician runs a company that manufactures\npowered wheel chairs for the elderly, does this activity supply a\nmedical benefit? When physicians consult with an insurance company\nabout cost-effective treatments that save their patients money, is this\nactivity a beneficent component of the practice of medicine?\n\n\nControversy over the ends of medicine requires decisions about what\nis to count as the practice of medicine and, derivatively, what counts\nas medical beneficence. Controversy appears not only in the literature\nof biomedical ethics, but also in some split decisions of the U. S.\nSupreme Court\u2014notably in Gonzales v. Oregon, a case\ndealing with physician-hastened death. The majority decision in this\ncase asserts that there is no consensus among health care professionals\nabout the precise boundaries of the legitimate practice of\nmedicine, a legal notion similar to the medical-ethics notion of\nthe proper ends of medicine. The court notes that there is reasonable\ndisagreement in the community of physicians regarding the appropriate\nprocess for determining the boundaries of medical practice and that\nthere is also reasonable disagreement about the extent to which the\ngovernment should be involved in drawing boundaries when physicians\nthemselves disagree. This court opinion allows that, depending on state\nlaw, a physician may legitimately assist in various ways to help bring\nabout the death of a terminally ill patient who has explicitly and\ncompetently requested this assistance from the physician.\n6.3 Harms and Benefits in Health Care\n\n\nA health professional\u2019s conception of both harm to and benefit for a\npatient can differ sharply from that of the patient, but the health\nprofessional\u2019s understandings of benefits also often depend on the\npatient\u2019s view of what constitutes a benefit or a worthwhile risk.\nDifferent patients take different views about what constitutes a harm\nand a benefit, and when each view is reasonable it is morally\nunacceptable to maintain that the notions of medical benefit and harm\nare independent of the patient\u2019s judgment.\n\n\nPhysician-hastened death by request of the\npatient\u2014controversially characterized as\nphysician-assisted suicide\u2014is again a prominent example of this\nproblem. Physicians and nurses have long worried that patients who\nforgo life-sustaining treatment with the intention of dying are killing\nthemselves and that health professionals are assisting in their\nsuicide. These worries have recently receded in significance in\nbiomedical ethics, because there is now a consensus in law and ethics\n(in the U.S. and far beyond) that it is never a moral violation to\nwithhold or withdraw a medical treatment that has been validly refused.\nThis consensus began to be developed with the case of Karen Ann Quinlan\nin 1976 and eventually was formed around U. S. Supreme Court decisions,\nespecially the Cruzan Case of 1990. The writings of numerous\nphilosophers and lawyers contributed to the formation of this\nconsensus. A clear part of the consensus is that it is a moral\nviolation not to withhold or withdraw a validly refused\nlife-sustaining treatment. If death is hastened in this way by\na physician\u2019s omission or action, there can be no moral objection to\nwhat has been done, and a physician\u2019s cooperation can rightly be viewed\nas merciful and benevolent.\n\n\nHowever, this problem has been replaced by another: Is it harmful or\nbeneficial to help a competent patient who has requested help in\ncausing a hastened death? In addition to vexed questions about\nthe purported distinction between killing and letting die, this issue\npresses the question of what counts as a benefit and what counts as a\nharm. Is requested death in the face of miserable suffering a benefit\nfor some patients while a harm caused to other patients? When is it a\nbenefit, and when a harm? Is the answer to this question determined by\nthe method used to bring about death--for example, withdrawal of\ntreatment by contrast to use of lethal medication?\n6.4 Social Beneficence and Public Policy\n\n\nA number of controversial issues in biomedical ethics concern how\npublic policy could, and should, change if obligations of social\nbeneficence were given more strength in policy formulation than they\nhave traditionally been afforded. The foundations of public policy\nregarding organ procurement provide an instructive example. Established\nlegal and policy precedents in many countries require express consent\nby a decedent before death or by the family after death. A near\nabsolute right of autonomy to decide about the disposition of organs\nand tissues has been the prevailing norm. However, this approach\nimpairs the efficient collection of needed tissues and organs, and many\npeople die as a result of the shortage of organs. The scarcity of\norgans and tissues and the inefficiency of the system have prompted a\nspate of proposals for reform of the current system of procurement,\nwith the goal of creating more space for social beneficence.\n\n\nOne policy proposal with a notably strong social-beneficence\ncommitment is the routine retrieval of organs and tissues. In\nthis system of procurement, a community is permitted to, and encouraged\nto, routinely collect organs and tissues from the deceased, unless the\ndead person had previously registered his or her objection to the\nsystem with the state. The routine retrieval of tissues and organs from\nthe deceased is regarded by many as unjustified on traditional grounds\nof respect for autonomy. However, advocates of the policy of routine\nretrieval argue that members of a community have an obligation to\nprovide other persons with objects of lifesaving value when no cost to\nthemselves is required. That is, the justification is based on\nbeneficence, not respect for autonomy.\n\n\nThe debate is likely to continue for many years about whether\nbeneficence or respect for autonomy should prevail in public policy\ngoverning organ retrieval. Advocates of the current system argue that\nindividual and family rights of consent should retain dominance.\nAdvocates of routine retrieval argue that traditional social priorities\ninvolving beneficence in conflict with autonomy have been wrongly\nstructured. Meanwhile, most contributors to the literature on the\nsubject agree that the present situation of low-level organ-procurement\nis morally unsatisfactory and in need of some significant measure of\nreform.\n6.5 Social Beneficence and Social Justice\n\n\nSome of the most important issues in the ethics of health and health\ncare today are widely classified as issues of social justice. However,\nat the hands of many writers, social justice is notably similar to\nsocial beneficence. For example, perhaps the most important moral\nproblem in global ethics is how to structure both the global order and\nnational systems that affect health so that burdens are avoided,\nbenefits are provided, and then both are fairly distributed using a\nthreshold condition of equitable levels of health and access to health\ncare. Globalization has brought a realization that problems of\nprotecting health and providing beneficial services are international\nin nature and that their alleviation will require a restructuring of\nthe global system.\n\n\nJohn Rawls\u2019s A Theory of Justice has been enormously\ninfluential in advanced work on these problems in biomedical ethics.\nRawls argues that a social arrangement forming a political state is a\ncommunal effort to advance the good of all in the society. His starting\nassumptions are layered with beneficent, egalitarian goals of making\nthe unequal situation of the naturally disadvantaged members of society\nboth better and more equal. His recognition of a positive societal\nobligation to eliminate or reduce barriers that prevent fair\nopportunity and that correct or compensate for various disadvantages\nhas implications for discussions of both beneficence and justice in\nhealth care.\n\n\nRawls himself never pursued these health-centered issues, but his\ntheory has influenced many writers on moral problems of health and\nbiomedical ethics, including Norman Daniels, Martha Nussbaum, and the\nteam of Madison Powers and Ruth Faden. One of Daniels\u2019 main questions\nis \u201cHow can we meet health needs fairly under reasonable limits\nto resources committed to the task?\u201d The \u201cfairly\u201d\npart of this formulation may be justice-based, but the notion of\n\u201creasonable limits to resources\u201d is closely tied to the\nproblems of the limits of beneficence mentioned previously. Daniels\nargues that because health is affected by many social factors, theories\nof justice should not center entirely on access to health care, but\nalso on the need to reduce health inequalities by improving social\nconditions that affect the health of societies, such as having clean\nwater, adequate nutrition, and general sanitation.\n\n\nPowers and Faden view the well-being of the worst-off members of\nglobal society as the proper starting point for a practical theory of\njustice, but their theory can also be expressed as an argument from\nsocial beneficence. The sweep of global poverty and its impact on\nhealth and welfare is a major topic in the theories of Singer and\nPowers and Faden. The consequences of extreme poverty for health are\nwell-documented, and these consequences inform Powers and Faden\u2019s\ntheories of both basic well-being and justice. Their theory also\nidentifies unfair patterns of advantage and unfair relations of power\nsuch as subordination, exploitation, and social exclusion that are\nrooted in unjust social-structural conditions. Among other things,\ntheir theory assesses the degree to which institutional structures can\nbe expected to fulfill the mandates of the theory.\n\n\nRecently, \u201ccapability theory\u201d has, at the hands of\nvarious writers from several disciplines, merged concerns of justice\nand beneficence. This type of theory focuses on distributions intended\nto enable persons to reach certain functional levels essential for a\nflourishing life that is protected by social institutions. The idea is\nto start with an understanding of health and individual well-being and\nthen to connect that account to basic capabilities for achieving levels\nof functioning essential to well-being\u2014through, for example,\nproper nutrition and access to health care. Some core capabilities are\nbodily health, ability to play, ability to affiliate socially, freedom\nof movement, and adequate educational level. Amartya Sen and Martha\nNussbaum are advocates of a capabilities theory.\n\n\nSome writers closely connected to bioethics and health policy have\nmoved beyond capabilities theory with a twist toward beneficence and\nwell-being. Powers and Faden provide a theory closely connected to\nglobal health policy. They start with a basic premise: Social justice\nis concerned with human well-being\u2014not only health, but what they\ncall six distinct, core dimensions of well-being. The six are health,\npersonal security, reasoning, respect, attachment, and\nself-determination. Each of these dimensions is an independent concern\nof justice. While this list of six dimensions is in some respects\nsimilar to Nussbaum\u2019s\u2014for example, \u201cattachment\u201d\nresembles what Nussbaum calls \u201caffiliation\u201d\u2014Powers\nand Faden reject the language of capabilities as misleading and wide of\nthe target of theories of justice and beneficence. Theirs is a list of\nessential core dimensions of well-being, not core capabilities. Being\nhealthy, being secure, and being respected are desirable states of\nbeing, not merely capabilities or functionings. For example, we want\nnot merely the capability to be well-nourished, but to\nbe well-nourished.\n\n\nIn this theory the justice and beneficence of societies and of the\nglobal order are to be judged by how well they effect these well-being\ndimensions in their political structures and social practices. The job\nof global justice and beneficence is to secure a sufficient level of\neach dimension for persons and to alleviate the social structures that\ncause the corresponding forms of ill-being. This theory of well-being\nand its place in moral theory and social policy can be expressed in\nterms of the roles of both social beneficence and social justice.\n7. Beneficence in Business Ethics\n\n\nBusiness ethics is a second area of applied ethics in which\nquestions about beneficence have emerged as central. Hume\u2019s immediate\nsuccessor in sentiment theory, Adam Smith, held an important view about\nthe role and place of benevolence that has influenced a number of\nwriters in business ethics. Smith argued that the wealth of nations and\nthe well-being of their citizens are dependent upon social\ncooperation\u2014fundamentally, political and economic\ncooperation\u2014but that this realm is not dependent on the\nbenevolence of moral relations. Smith proposes that it would be vain\nfor us to expect benevolence in market societies. In commercial\ntransactions the only successful strategy in motivating persons is to\nappeal to personal advantage: Never expect benevolence from a butcher,\nbrewer, or baker; expect from them only a regard to their own interest.\nMarket societies operate not by concerns of humanity and benevolence,\nbut from self-love.\n7.1 Corporate Beneficence\n\n\nSeveral problems in business ethics are attempts to come to grips\nwith Smith\u2019s view. Discussions of the role of the corporation in\nsociety and the very purpose of a corporation as a social institution\nare examples. It is not disputed that the purpose of a for-profit\ncorporation is to make a profit for stockholders, but there is an\nintense debate about whether maximizing stockholder profits is the\nsole legitimate purpose of corporations\u2014as Milton\nFriedman and others have argued\u2014and whether truly beneficent\ncorporate conduct is justifiable. This question is normative, but Smith\nalso raises questions of moral psychology: Is it reasonable to expect\nbenevolent acts from members of the business community? Does\nbeneficence have any place in the world of business as we know it?\n\n\nCorporate social programs often appear to involve a mixture of\nlimited beneficence and self-interested goals such as developing and\nsustaining relationships with customers. An example is found in public\nutilities\u2019 programs to help customers pay for electricity, gas, oil,\nphone service, and the like. These programs sometimes decrease rather\nthan increase corporate profits. They are, in effect, a form of\ncorporate philanthropy. The programs locate and attempt to remedy the\nroot causes of bill nonpayment, which typically involve financial\ndistress. The programs also seek to rescue people in the community who\nare in unfortunate circumstances because of industrial injury, the ill\nhealth of a spouse or child, drug dependency, and the like. The company\nmay even pay for consumer advocates, who are social workers trained to\ndeal with customers and their problems. These programs, by design, make\nlife better for various members of the community who have suffered\nmisfortune. They may not be entirely motivated by benevolence, however,\nbecause they may be heavily designed to achieve a positive public image\nas well as to receive payment for overdue bills.\n\n\nSome firms have charitable programs that seem to be cases of pure\nbeneficence\u2014that is, not ones admixed with forms of outreach that\nwill help the company. Money is taken directly out of profits, with no\nexpected return of benefits. It has been questioned, however, whether\nprograms of even this description are instances of pure benevolence. In\nthe precedent U. S. case of A. P. Smith Manufacturing v.\nBarlow (1953), a judge determined that a beneficent charitable\ndonation to Princeton University by the A. P. Smith Co. was a\nlegitimate act of beneficence by responsible corporate officers.\nHowever, the judge acknowledged that such beneficence may not be pure\nbeneficence, but rather an act taken in the interest of the corporation\nby building its public image and esteem. In effect, the judge suggests\nthat such a gift, while beneficent, may not derive from entirely\nbenevolent motives. If beneficent acts by corporations are nothing more\nthan clever ways to maximize profits, then these actions seem to\nsatisfy Friedman\u2019s conception.\n\n\nWhatever the truth about businesses\u2019 motives, a separate question is\nwhether businesses have obligations of beneficent action. Stakeholder\ntheory answers in the affirmative. In the classical\nprofit-to-stockholder view, stockholders\u2019 interests were supreme, but\nthis view often lost sight of the interests of other stakeholders,\nparticularly those whose efforts are necessary for a firm\u2019s survival\nand flourishing. Who deserves to benefit from corporate income? A\nstakeholder is any individual or group that can affect or benefit, or\nbe affected by or benefited by, a business organization. Stakeholders\nwho can be affected by corporate activities include customers,\nemployees, suppliers, owners, local communities, subcontractors,\nconsultants, and stockholders. Stakeholder theory is commonly regarded\nas a theory of corporate responsibility\u2014the theory that managers\nof a firm have obligations to a specified group of stakeholders. Many\nof these obligations are ones of beneficence, especially with regard to\nemployees and other stockholders. Benefit packages for employees\nprovide a standard example. Stockholder theory, by contrast, is the\ntheory that managers have obligations\u2014conceived as fiduciary\nduties\u2014only to stockholder interests. In contemporary business\nethics it is commonly held that corporate responsibility requires some\nform of stakeholder inclusion, but this perspective has not been\ndeveloped in adequate detail as a theory of corporate obligations of\nbeneficence, because there may be additional obligations of beneficence\nto contribute to social awareness and public policy even if the\naffected community is not truly a stakeholder.\n\n\nDo corporations have obligations of beneficence to some larger\ncommunity? Many corporations have answered yes to this question. In a\nstatement of \u201cThe Johnson and Johnson Way,\u201d the Johnson and\nJohnson Company credo, it is said that Johnson and Johnson is\nresponsible to the communities in which it thrives, and indeed to the\nworld community. The company asserts an obligation to be good citizens,\nincluding offering the support of charities, the encouragement of civic\nprogress, the bettering of public health, and the improvement of\neducation. Johnson and Johnson and other companies assert that they\nhave obligations to these ends, but to many writers in business ethics\nthis claim of obligations is either misguided or overstated. They\nregard such moral demands as broad moral ideals or institutional\ncommitments, especially if they reach out to the world community.\n7.2 Corporate Benefit-Paternalism\n\n\nPaternalism is often found in the practices of business and in\ngovernment regulation of business. For example, many businesses require\nemployees to deduct money from their salary for a retirement account;\nthey may also deduct salary money to pay for a life insurance policy.\nIf employees do not want these \u201cbenefits,\u201d they are not\nfree to reject them. Paternalism is here assumed to be an appropriate\nliberty-limiting principle. Another commonplace example comes from the\nconstruction industry and the chemical industry. If an employee wishes\nnot to wear a particular suit, mask, or other protective device, the\ncompany (and perhaps also the government) will compel it anyway, often\n(though not always) for paternalistic reasons.\n\n\nAn ongoing example of paternalism is the restriction for\npaternalistic reasons (there might be other reasons as well) of various\npictures, literature, or information\u2014often violent\ndepictions\u2014on the internet, in bookstores, and in video stores.\nCustomers may wish to purchase or receive information about these\nproducts, but paternalism thwarts their preferences. Arguments are put\nforward maintaining that those exposed to violent conduct will harm\nthemselves by such exposure\u2014for example, pornography\nmight reinforce their emotional problems or render them incapable of\nlove and other distinctively human relationships.\n\n\nA classic problem of paternalism in business ethics derives from the\nprinciple of caveat emptor\u2014Latin for \u201clet the\nbuyer beware.\u201d This property-law-derived principle is a general\nprinciple governing sales: A buyer is responsible for determining any\nunfitness in a product and is not due any form of refund or exchange\nunless the seller has actively concealed the unfitness. The buyer is\nfree to make the purchase or not make it. Paternalistic restrictions on\npurchasing have the objective that buyers not harm themselves or not\nfail to receive benefits that they otherwise might not receive. For\nexample, the control and inspection of pharmaceutical products and\ncontrolled substances\u2013through government policies and licensed\npharmacies\u2014has often been justified by appeal to paternalism.\nMany believe that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the U.S. is\nfundamentally a paternalistic agency that operates to protect the\npublic even while some members of the public do not want or approve of\nthe protections afforded.\n\n\nAs the marketplace for products has grown more complex and the\nproducts more sophisticated, buyers have become increasingly dependent\nupon salespersons to know their products and to tell the truth about\nthem. An enduring question in business ethics is whether a\nsalesperson\u2019s role should be viewed as that of paternalistic protector\nof the interests of the buyer. Suppose, for example, that a consumer\nwants a sprinkler system in his yard to water his grove of evergreens.\nHe loves the sound and look of sprinklers. However, these sprinklers\nare worthless for appropriate watering of the roots of his evergreens:\nThe owner needs drip-hose for his large collection of pine, spruce,\ncedar, and cypress. Should a salesperson insist on selling only\ndrip-hose, refusing to sell sprinkler heads; or should the salesperson\nacquiesce to the customer\u2019s preference for sprinklers?\n\n\nTraditionally salespersons have not viewed their obligations of\nbeneficence in this way, but perhaps paternalistic beneficence would be\na commendable change of practice.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Adler, Matthew D., 2012, <em>Well-Being and Fair Distribution:\nBeyond Cost-Benefit Analysis</em>, New York: Oxford University\nPress.", "Adler, Matthew D. and Marc Fleurbaey (eds.), 2016, <em>Oxford\nHandbook of Wellbeing and Public Policy</em>, New York: Oxford\nUniversity Press.", "Arneson, Richard J., 2004, \u201cMoral Limits on the Demands of\nBeneficence?\u201d In <em>The Ethics of Assistance</em>, Deen K.\nChatterjee (ed.), Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.", "Beauchamp, Tom L., and Childress, James F., 2019, <em>Principles of\nBiomedical Ethics</em>, 8<sup>th</sup> edition, New York: Oxford\nUniversity Press, Chapter 6.", "Braybrooke, David, 2003, \u201cA Progressive Approach to Personal\nResponsibility for Global Beneficence,\u201d <em>The Monist</em>, 86:\n301\u201322.", "Cullity, Garrett, 2007, \u201cBeneficence.\u201d In R.
