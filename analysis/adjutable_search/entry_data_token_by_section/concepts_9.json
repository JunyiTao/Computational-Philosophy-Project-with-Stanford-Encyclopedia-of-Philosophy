We\u2019ve\nseen that conceptual structure is invoked to explain, among other\nthings, typicality effects, reflective categorization, cognitive\ndevelopment, reference determination, and compositionality. But there\nis no reason to assume that a single type of structure can explain all\nof these things. As a result, there is no reason why philosophers\nshouldn\u2019t maintain that concepts have different types of\nstructure. For example, notice that atomism is largely motivated by\nanti-descriptivism. In effect, the atomist maintains that considerable\npsychological variability is consistent with concepts entering into\nthe same mind-world causal relations, and that it\u2019s the latter\nthat determines a concept\u2019s reference. But just because the\nmechanisms of reference determination permit considerable\npsychological variability doesn\u2019t mean that there aren\u2019t,\nin fact, significant patterns for psychologists to uncover. On the\ncontrary, the evidence for typicality effects is impressive by any\nmeasure. For this reason, it isn\u2019t unreasonable to claim that\nconcepts do have prototype structure even if that structure has\nnothing to do with the determination of a concept\u2019s referent.\nSimilar considerations suggest that concepts may have theory-structure\nand perhaps other types of structure as well (see Laurence &\nMargolis 1999 on different types of conceptual structure). \n\nOne way of responding to the plurality of conceptual structures is to\nsuppose that concepts have multiple types of structure. This is the\ncentral idea behind conceptual pluralism. According to one\nversion of conceptual pluralism, suggested by Laurence & Margolis\n(1999), a given concept will have a variety of different types of\nstructure associated with it as components of the concept in question.\nFor example, concepts may have atomic cores that are linked to\nprototypes, internalized theories, and so on. On this approach, the\ndifferent types of structure that are components of a given concept\nplay different explanatory roles. Reference determination and\ncompositionality have more to do with the atomic cores themselves and\nhow they are causally related to things outside of the mind, while\nrapid categorization and certain inferences depend on prototype\nstructure, and more considered inferences and reasoning depend upon\ntheory structure. Many variants on this general proposal are possible,\nbut the basic idea is that, while concepts have a plurality of\ndifferent types of structure with different explanatory roles, this\ndiffering structure remains unified through the links to an atomic\nrepresentation that provides a concept\u2019s reference. One\nchallenge for this type of account is to delineate which of the\ncognitive resources that are associated with a concept should be\ncounted as part of its structure and which should not. As a general\nframework, the account is neutral regarding this question, but as the\nframework is filled in, clarification will be needed regarding the\nstatus of potential types of structure. \n\nA different form of pluralism about conceptual structure doesn\u2019t\nemploy atomic cores but simply says that the prototype, theory, etc.\nare all themselves concepts (Weiskopf 2009). Rather than holding that\na single concept (e.g., the concept CAT) has multiple types of\nstructure as components, as in the first form of pluralism, this form\ntakes each type of structure to be a concept on its own,\nresulting in a plurality of concepts (CAT1,\nCAT2, CAT3, etc). On this view, it is wrong to\nsuppose that there is such a thing as the concept CAT. Instead,\nthere are many cat-concepts, each with a different type of structure,\nwhere each is involved in just a subset of the high-level\npsychological processes associated with cats. CAT1, for\nexample, might explain some instances of categorization and some\ninferences, while CAT2, CAT3, etc. explain\nothers. What\u2019s more, on this form of pluralism, people might\nalso differ with respect to which kinds of cat-concepts they possess.\nAnd even if two people have a cat-concept with the same general type\nof structure (e.g., prototype structure), the concepts might still be\nrather different (treating prototypical cats as having rather\ndifferent sorts of properties). In response to this second form of\npluralism, some philosophers have argued that CAT1,\nCAT2, etc. may be better understood as different senses of\na single CAT concept, on analogy with the different senses of a\npolysemous linguistic expression (e.g. the physical object\nsense and the content sense of \u201cbook\u201d)(Vicente\n& Manrique 2016). Regardless of whether one accepts this point\nabout polysemy, an important challenge facing this second\n(\u201cmultiple concepts\u201d) version of pluralism is to explain\nwhy all of the different cat-concepts count as cat-concepts\u2014that\nis, to explain what unifies the plurality of cat-concepts. A natural\nanswer to this challenge is that what unifies them is that they all\nrefer to the same category, the category of cats. But it is not so\nclear that they can all refer to the same category given the\ndifferences between the different cat-concepts and the way that they\nfunction in cognition. For example, a standard prototype structure\nwould capture prototypical cats and exclude the highly unusual,\natypical cats that a theory structure would cover, and consequently\nthe two concepts would refer to distinct (though related) categories.\n\n\nIn all of its forms, pluralism about conceptual structure recognizes\nthat concepts have diverse functions and that a corresponding variety\nof types of representations are needed to fulfill these functions.\nThese same considerations have led some theorists to advocate\nconcept eliminativism\u2014the view that there are no concepts\n(Machery 2009). The reasoning behind concept eliminativism is that\nconcept should be understood to be a natural kind if concepts\nexist at all, and that natural kinds ought to have significant\ncommonalities that can be discovered using empirical methods,\nincluding commonalities that go well beyond the criteria that are\ninitially used to characterize them. But according to concept\neliminativists, there are no such commonalities that hold among the\ntypes of representations that pluralists embrace. Perhaps we need\nprototypes and theories and other types of representations for\ndistinct higher-level cognitive processes, but they are too diverse to\nwarrant the claim that they constitute a single kind. On this view,\nthen, we should simply abandon the theoretical construct of a concept\nand refer only to more fine-grained types of representations, such as\nprototypes and theories. Opponents of concept eliminativism have\nresponded to the eliminativist\u2019s challenge in a number of ways.\nSome have argued that Machery\u2019s criteria for elimination are\nsimply too strong and that concept, understood as a\nhigher-level kind or perhaps a functional kind, has great utility in\npsychological models of cognitive processes (e.g., Hampton 2010,\nLalumera 2010, Strohminger & Moore 2010). Others have argued that\nMachery\u2019s criteria for something\u2019s being a natural kind\nare too restrictive and that his view would have the consequence of\nruling out clear cases of legitimate higher-level kinds in science\ngenerally (e.g., Gonnerman & Weinberg 2010, Margolis &\nLaurence 2010). And others have argued that even if we grant\nMachery\u2019s stringent criteria for being a natural kind,\nelimination wouldn\u2019t follow, as concepts are natural\nkinds according to his criteria (Samuels & Ferreira 2010, Weiskopf\n2010).
