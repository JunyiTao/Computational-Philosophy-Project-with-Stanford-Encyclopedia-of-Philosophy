    "main_text": "Crucial Experimental Evidence || Duhem\u2019s Predicament and the Oxidative Phosphorylation Controversy\n2.1 Duhem\u2019s Predicament and the Oxidative Phosphorylation Controversy\n\nBiological textbooks are replete with famous experiments that are\npresented as having provided crucial experimental evidence for some\nhypothesis. To name just a few examples: Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod\nand Maclyn McCarthy (1944) are reputed to have established DNA as the\ncarrier of hereditary information by a set of ingenious transformation\nexperiments using a bacterium causing lung infection,\nPneumococcus. Matthew Meselson and Frank Stahl (1958)\nconducted an experiment in that is widely thought to have provided\nevidence that DNA replication is semi-conservative rather than\nconservative or dissipative (meaning that a newly formed DNA double\nhelix contains one intact strand from the parent molecule and one\nnewly synthesized strand). Ephraim Racker and Walter Stoeckenius\n(1974) are thought to have provided experimental evidence that settled\nthe long-standing controversy (known as the \u201coxidative\nphosphorylation or ox-phos controversy\u201d) as to whether\nrespiration and the generation of the energy-rich compound ATP in\nmitochondria are coupled through a chemical intermediate or a proton\ngradient.\n\nMany philosophers of science have been skeptical about the possibility\nof such \u201ccrucial experiments\u201d. Most famous are the\narguments provided by Pierre Duhem (1905), who claimed that crucial\nexperimental are impossible (in physics) because, even if they succeed\nin eliminating a false hypothesis, this does not prove that the\nremaining hypothesis is true. Scientists, unlike mathematicians, are\nnever in possession of a complete set of hypotheses one of which must\nbe true. It is always possible that the true hypothesis has not yet\nbeen conceived, thus eliminating all but one hypothesis by crucial\nexperiments will not necessarily lead to the truth.\n\nBased on such considerations, it could be argued that the function of\nthe alleged crucial experiments in biological textbooks is more\npedagogical than evidential. In order to assess this claim, I will\nconsider two examples in somewhat greater detail, namely the ox-phos\ncontroversy and the Meselson-Stahl case.\n\nThe ox-phos controversy was about the mechanism by which respiration\n(i.e., the oxidation of energy-rich compounds) is coupled to the\nphosphorylation of ADP (adenosine diphosphate) to ATP (adenosine\ntriphosphate). The reverse reaction, hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and\ninorganic phosphate, is used by cells to power numerous biochemical\nreactions such as the synthesis of proteins as well as small\nmolecules, the replication of DNA, locomotion, and many more (the\nenergy for muscle contraction is also provided by ATP hydrolysis).\nThus, ATP functions like a universal biochemical battery that is used\nto power all kinds of cellular processes. So how can the cell use the\nchemical energy contained in food to charge these batteries? A first\npathway that generates ATP from ADP to be described was glycolysis,\nthe degradation of sugar. This pathway does not require oxygen. The\nway it works is that the breakdown of sugar is used by the cell to\nmake an activated phosphate compound \u2013 a so-called high-energy\nintermediate \u2013 that subsequently transfers its phosphate group\nto ADP to make ATP. \n\nIt was clear already in the 1940s that this cannot be the only process\nthat makes ATP, as it is anaerobic (doesn\u2019t require oxygen) and not\nvery efficient. The complete breakdown of food molecules requires\noxygen. Hans Krebs showed that this occurs in a cyclic reaction\npathway today known as the Krebs cycle. The Krebs cycle generates a\ncompound called reduced NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide). The\nbig question in biochemistry from the 1940s onward was how this\ncompound was oxidized and how this oxidation was coupled to the\nphosphorylation of ADP. Naturally, biochemists searched for a\nhigh-energy intermediate as it was used in glycolysis. However, this\nintermediate proved to be extremely elusive.\n\nIn 1961, the British biochemist Peter Mitchell (1961) suggested a\nmechanism for oxidative phosphorylation (as this process became known)\nthat did not require a high-energy intermediate. According to\nMitchell\u2019s scheme, NADH is oxidized step-wise on the inner membranes\nof mitochondria (membrane-bounded intracellular organelles that are\ncanonically described as the cell\u2019s power stations). This process\noccurs asymmetrically with respect to the membrane such that a net\ntransport of protons across the membrane occurs (later it was shown\nthat the protons are actually transported across proteinaceous pores\nin the membrane). Thus, a concentration gradient of protons builds up.\nAs protons are electrically charged, this gradient also creates a\nvoltage difference across the membrane. How is this energy used?\nAccording to Mitchell, the membrane contains another enzyme that uses\nthe energy of the proton gradient to directly phosphorylate ADP. Thus,\nit is the proton gradient that couples the reduction of NADH to the\nphosphorylation of ADP, not a chemical high-energy intermediate. This\nmechanism became known as the \u201cchemi-osmotic mechanism\u201d.\n\nMitchell\u2019s hypothesis was met with considerable skepticism, in spite\nof the fact that Mitchell and a co-worker were quickly able to produce\nexperimental evidence in its favor. Specifically, he was able to\ndemonstrate that isolated respiring mitochondria indeed expel protons\n(thus leading to a detectable acidification of the surrounding\nsolution), as his hypothesis predicted. However, this evidence was\ndismissed by most of the biochemists at that time as inconclusive. For\nit was difficult to rule out at that time that the proton expulsion by\nrespiring mitochondria was a mere side-effect of respiration, while\nthe energy coupling was still mediated by a chemical intermediate.\n\nThis was the beginning of one of the most epic controversies in the\nhistory of 20th Century biochemistry. It took the larger part of a\ndecade to resolve this issue, time during which several laboratories\nclaimed success in finding the elusive chemical intermediate. But none\nof these findings survived critical scrutiny. On the other side, all\nthe evidence adduced by Mitchell and his few supporters was considered\nnon-conclusive for the reasons mentioned above. Weber (2002) shows\nthat the two competing theories of oxidative phosphorylation can be\nviewed as incommensurable in the sense of T.S. Kuhn (1970), without\nthereby being incomparable (as Kuhn is often misread).\n\nNonetheless, the controversy was eventually closed in the mid-1970s in\nMitchell\u2019s favor, earning him the 1978 Nobel Prize for Chemistry. The\ncause(s) for this closure are subject to interpretation. Most\nbiochemistry textbooks as well as Weber (2002, 2005) cite a famous\nexperiment by Ephraim Racker and Walter Stoeckenius (1974) as crucial\nfor establishing Mitchell\u2019s mechanism. These biochemists worked with\nsynthetic membrane vesicles into which they had inserted purified\nenzymes, one of which being the mitochondrial ATPase (the enzyme\ndirectly responsible for phosphorylation of ADP). The other enzyme was\nnot derived from mitochondria at all, but from a photosynthetic\nbacterium. This enzyme had been shown to function as a light-driven\nproton pump. When this enzyme was inserted into artificial membrane\nvesicles together with the mitochondrial ATPase, the vesicles\nphosphorylated ADP upon illumination.\n\nThis experiment was viewed as crucial evidence for the chemi-osmotic\nmechanism because it was the first demonstration that the ATPase can\nbe powered by a chemiosmotic gradient alone. The involvement of a\nchemical intermediate could be ruled out because there were no\nrespiratory enzymes present to deliver an unknown intermediate to the\nATPase.\n\nThe Racker-Stoeckenius experiment is perhaps best viewed as a\nstraightforward case of an eliminative induction. On this\nview, the experiment decided between two causal graphs:\n\n (1)\n respiration \u2192 proton gradient \u2192 phosphorylation\n\n\nThe alternative causal graph was:\n\n (2)\n proton gradient \u2190 respiration \u2192 chemical high-energy\nintermediate \u2192 phosphorylation\n\n\nThe experiment showed a direct causal link from the protein gradient\nto phosphorylation, which was consistent with (1) but not with (2),\nthus (2) was eliminated. However, it is clear that Duhem-style\nskeptical doubts could be raised about this case. From a strictly\nlogical point of view, even if the experiment ruled out the chemical\nhypothesis, it didn\u2019t prove Mitchell\u2019s hypothesis.\n\nSo why have biochemists emphasized this experiment so much? Perhaps\nthe reason is not merely the beauty of the experiment or its\npedagogical value. From a methodological point of view, the experiment\nstands out from other experiments in the amount of control that\nbiochemists had of what was going on in their test tubes. Because it\nwas an artificially created system assembled from purified components,\nthe biochemists knew exactly what they had put in there, making it\nless likely that they were deceived by traces from the enormously\ncomplex system from which these biochemical agents were derived. On\nsuch an interpretation, the experiment was not crucial in\nDuhem\u2019s sense of ruling out all alternative hypotheses. Rather,\nwhat distinguishes it is that, within the body of evidence that\nsupported Mitchell\u2019s hypothesis, this one reached an\nunprecedented standard of experimental rigor, making it more difficult\nfor opponents of Mitchell\u2019s hypothesis to challenge it (see\nWeber 2005, Chapter 4).\n",
