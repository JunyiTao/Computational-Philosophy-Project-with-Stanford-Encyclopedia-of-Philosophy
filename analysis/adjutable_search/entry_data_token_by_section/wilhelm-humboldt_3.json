    "main_text": "Humboldt\u2019s Life || Rome: the World of Antiquity and the Languages of the New World\n1.4 Rome: the World of Antiquity and the Languages of the New World\n\nFrom 1803 until the end of 1808 he served as Prussian envoy (Minister\nResident) to the Vatican in Rome, a post whose diplomatic chores he\ndispatched with skill and efficiency leaving him enough time for his\nown work. Besides his Basque studies he turned his attention again to\nancient Greek language and literature, translating from the poetry of\nPindar (Olympic Odes), Aischylos tragedy Agamemnon\nas well as smaller pieces from other authors (GS Vol 8: 3\u2013270).\nThe introduction to his German version of Agamemnon includes\na succinct statement of his theory of translation where he formulated\na new approach to the problem of translation and developed concepts\nthat have been taken up again only in modern (Walter Benjamin) and\ncontemporary translation theories. But Humboldt\u2019s life in the Eternal\nCity also lead him to reflect deeply about the fate of ancient culture\nand its history, a concern that found expression in his two essays\n\u201cLatium und Hellas\u201d 1806, and \u201cGeschichte des\nVerfalls und Untergangs der griechischen Freistaaten\u201d\n(\u201cLatium and Hellas\u201d, \u201cHistory of the Decline and\nFall of the Greek Republics\u201d) 1807\u20131808 (GS Vol 3:\n136\u201370; 171\u2013218). Under the impact of Schiller\u2019s untimely\ndeath in 1805 he composed the elegy \u201cRome\u201d (published in\n1806), the best known of his poems. His stay in Rome unexpectedly\nadded yet another dimension to his linguistic interests that would\nbecome significant for his future linguistic research endeavors: the\nnative languages of the Americas. He had already asked his brother\nAlexander before he set sail for the New World to be on the lookout\nfor linguistic materials during his travels in South and Central\nAmerica. In Rome he had the opportunity to meet and befriend the\nformer chief of the Jesuit Missions in the Americas and head of the\nPapal Quirinal Library, the Spaniard Lorenzo Herv\u00e1s\n(1753\u20131809). His new acquaintance was himself a renowned\nlinguist with whose work (for example his Cat\u00e1logo des las\nlenguas de las naciones conocidas, 1787) Humboldt was already\nfamiliar. He was given the chance to consult and eventually to copy\nthe entire collection of Herv\u00e1s\u2019 extensive holdings of Native\nAmerican grammars and materials. These would form the basis for his\nown study of the American languages. While he was perusing his\nlinguistic researches, Humboldt\u2019s residence in the Villa Gregoriana\nbecame a popular gathering place for the members of the European\nartist colony, which harbored figures like Bertel Thorwaldsen,\nChristian David Rauch, Gottlieb Schlick, Karl Ludwig Fernow and Johann\nGeorg Zoega. Among the European visitors who came to see Humboldt were\nMadame de Sta\u00ebl, August Wilhelm Schlegel and the English poet\nColeridge. Although he lost two of his sons in Rome (of the Humboldt\u2019s\neight children three died at an early age) he considered the Roman\nyears as the happiest of his life.\n",
