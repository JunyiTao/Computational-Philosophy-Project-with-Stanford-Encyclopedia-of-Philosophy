    "main_text": "Proximal Theories of Sounds || Sounds as Sensations\n1.1 Sounds as Sensations\n\nModern philosophical accounts of sounds informed by psychology of\nperception construe sounds as \u201csensations\u201d, or\nstates/properties of hearers. Consider,\n\n\nIt seems\u2026reasonable to suggest that the sounds directly\nperceived are sensations of some sort produced in the observer when\nthe sound waves strike the ear. (Maclachlan 1989: 26)\n\n\nThe sound-as-sensations theory is justified by some facts about\nauditory experience. People report hearing voices and bells even when\nno one is speaking and no bell is ringing. Various examples of\nsubjective sounds are documented under the label of tinnitus. In an\nanechoic chamber, most subjects experience subjective buzzing and\nwhistlings. Some subjects undergo pathologic tinnitus when they hear\nsounds that disrupt their normal auditory capabilities. When Russian\ncomposer Shostacovich turned his head on a side, he was subject to a\nflow of melodies (Sacks 2008). Tinnitus and other subjective auditory\nphenomena have different causes, that can be related to the mechanical\nproperties of the inner ear or to more central features. The objects\nof these experiences are naturally and spontaneously categorized as\nsounds. If sounds are simply defined as the objects of audition, then\nthey are easily identified with the qualitative aspects of auditory\nperception. Various strands of indirect realism in perception would\nmake this view mandatory. According to them, it is by hearing the\nimmediate, proximal items that we hear some distal events or objects.\nIn such a case sounds would be defined as the immediate objects of\nauditory perception.\n",
