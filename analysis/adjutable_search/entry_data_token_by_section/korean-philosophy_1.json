    "main_text": "The Development of Buddhism in Korea || The Conceptual Background to Korean Buddhism\n2.1 The Conceptual Background to Korean Buddhism\n\nIn the late fourteenth century, Ch\u014fng Toj\u014fn (\u912d\u9053\u50b3 1342\u20131398), a Confucian literatus and philosopher, found it necessary to launch extensive criticisms of Korean Buddhism as he tried to help found the new Dynasty of Chos\u014fn in accordance with a Neo-Confucian vision. As he saw it, Korean Buddhism was hopelessly defective and corrupt in many ways. Most unfortunate of all, Ch\u014fng argued, it was based on the concept of mu (\u7121 Nothing) and thus necessarily led to nihilism, which undermined social morality and disrupted the political order (Ch\u014fng, \u201cAn Array of Critiques of Buddhism\u201d in Muller 2015, 54-81). This criticism is clearly far-fetched, as can be seen from the response (see below) of the Buddhist critic Hamh\u014f Kihwa (\u6db5\u865b\u5df1\u548c 1376\u20131431), a contemporary of his. Nevertheless, it shows a remarkable insight on the part of Ch\u014fng in regarding mu as the founding notion of Korean Buddhism whose philosophy is deeply rooted in the paradigm of emptiness (\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101) as an expression of inter-dependent co-origination of things. What I call \u201cmu\u201d may have been referred to in many ways in the past, e.g., emptiness (kong \u7a7a \u015b\u016bnyat\u0101), vacuity (h\u014f \u865b) or \u201cwuji\u201d (\u7121\u6975 infinite supreme), etc., but, in this work, \u201cmu\u201d roughly refers to the original dynamic yet serene dimension that is not induced by anything ephemeral in the world. It is a self-originating source of the world. A part of an active process, it also forms the momentum of a limitless dialectical movement. Historically speaking, this paradigm has a distinctive structure that serves as the basic conceptual framework for all major Korean intellectual traditions.\n\nKorean Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism grew out of the original form of Buddhism in the Indian subcontinent and the Chinese variant but it gradually developed its characteristics in Korea. Among its distinctive metaphysical claims about the nature of reality, it puts great emphasis on the priority of mu over being, which, however, is not a separate and isolated entity but a manifestation of the former. Further, the view holds that while reality is not two or divided, it can be expressed in different ways. This view is prominently presented in the doctrine of One Mind/Two Gates as well as the doctrine of two truths (the absolute truth and conventional truth) or a version therefor (see below for details). Eventually, this strain of Buddhism culminates in the doctrine that nirv\u0101\u1e47a (the enlightened state of liberation from sufferings) is metaphysically identical with sa\u1e43s\u0101ra (the infinite cycle of rebirth and thus sufferings), as suggested in the East Asian Classic Heart Sutra.\n\nFurther, strong eclectic tendencies in thought dominate Korean Buddhism within the broader field of East Asian Buddhism, resulting in a highly syncretic discourse. Korean Buddhist monks throughout history have demonstrated a marked tendency in their works to focus on disagreements between various sects within Buddhism or between Buddhism and other religions (Muller forthcoming). Just as Hegel did much later on the other side of the world, they all skillfully exercised their own form of dialectical thinking in resolving the various conflicts, e.g., emptiness vs. being, doctrine vs. meditation, innate evil nature vs. universal Buddha-nature, etc.\n\nIn the Buddhist tradition, the relation of reality and its manifestation has been characterized in many ways, e.g., emptiness (kong \u7a7a) and form (saek \u8272), praj\u00f1\u0101 (chihye \u667a\u6167) and skillful means (pangp\u2019y\u014fn \u65b9\u4fbf), and principle (i \u7406) and phenomena (sa \u4e8b), as well as Buddha-nature (puls\u014fng \u4f5b\u6027) and sentient beings (chungsaeng \u8846\u751f). But its most important application, seen in Korean Buddhism (and also Korean Neo-Confucianism), is that of Essence (\u9ad4) and Function (\u7528) where Essence refers to the innermost, fundamental dimension of the human mind, for example, the Buddha-mind as the pure, innate mind in and of itself, and Function refers to the manifested activity of such a mind in the world. In this context, Essence refers to the underlying nature of the mind, and Function to the expressed state, feeling or behavior of the person; and that state, feeling or behavior may belong to an ordinary unenlightened person (Muller 1995).\n\nIn addition to the emphasis on emptiness of all things as well as the Essence-Function paradigm, the Korean Buddhism also pledged allegiance to the doctrine of the womb (or embryo) of Buddhahood (tath\u0101gatagarbha). This view holds that even deluded ordinary beings possess in their very make up the capacity to achieve enlightenment. The mind is intrinsically luminous but simultaneously dulled by adventitious defilements. Thus, the mind is not intrinsically ignorant but only contingently yet universally so. This capacity within the mind is called tath\u0101gatagarbha (see, e.g., Suramgama Sutra).\n",
