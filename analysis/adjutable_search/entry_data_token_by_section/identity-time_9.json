    "main_text": "Diachronic Identity Puzzles || Four Dimensionalism\n4.5 Four Dimensionalism\n\nHere is what a classical four dimensionalist would say about the case\nof the cup. Suppose the interval from t1 to\nt2 is the time during which Cup has a handle\nattached to it, and t2 to t3\nthe interval during which Cup is without a handle, and, so, putatively\nidentical with Tcup. As before Hcup is the fusion of Tcup and Cup's\nhandle. According to the four dimensionalist, Cup, Tcup and Hcup are\nall extended in time as well as space. Tcup has a temporal part that\nextends from t1 to t2 together\nwith a temporal part that extends from t2 to\nt3. Tcup's t1 to\nt2 and t2 to\nt3 temporal parts are distinct from each other as\nwell as being distinct from the temporally longer Tcup. Hcup, that is\nTcup plus handle, is a four dimensional object that extends from\nt1 to t2. Cup itself consists\nof the following two, among indefinitely many other, temporal parts:\nHcup and the t2 to t3 part of\nTcup.\n\nWhat we should say according to the classical four dimensionalist is\nthis. The t1 to t2 temporal\npart of Tcup is a proper temporal and spatial part of Hcup. Hcup and\nthe t2 to t3 temporal parts of\nTcup are proper temporal parts of Cup. Cup is not identical with any\nof Hcup, Tcup from t1 to t2,\nTcup from t2 to t3, or Tcup\nfrom t1 to t3. In particular\nthere is no question of Cup being literally identical with Tcup from\nt2 to t3, when they are\nindiscernible, though, following David Lewis, we may say that Cup and\nTcup are identical at any time between t2 and\nt3 in the sense that they share temporal parts\nduring those times (see Lewis 1986).\n\nMany four-dimensionalists subscribe to a principle that a number of\nwriters call unrestricted mereological composition. According to that\nprinciple any set of, in this case four-dimensional, objects\nconstitute a further four dimensional object. Armed with the\nunrestricted mereological composition principle a four-dimensionalist\ncan say that what there is, in the case of Theseus' ship, is a Y\nbranching object dividable in an indefinite number of ways into four\ndimensional proper parts an indefinite number of which are ships. For\nexample the ship consisting of the stem together with the replacement\nbranch has as two of its proper parts a ship consisting of just the\nstem, and one consisting of just the replacement branch.\n\nApart from the argument that it provides the best solution to\ndiachronic identity puzzles four dimensionalism has been defended on a\nnumber of other grounds. One we have reviewed already; the argument\nthat four dimensionalism gives the best solution to the problem of\ntemporary intrinsics. Another, also offered by David Lewis, invokes\nthe principle that facts in general supervene on facts about the\ninstantiations of intrinsic properties and external relations. Call\nfacts about the instantiation of intrinsic properties and external\nrelations basic facts, and let R be the spatio-temporal\nregion occupied by Plate throughout its career. According to Lewis\nthere is a world W in which a sequence of shorter Plate-like\nobjects occupy R, and all of the basic facts that obtain in\nour world obtain in W. Lewis' supervenience principle tells\nus that all facts supervene on basic facts. The same basic facts\nobtain in both our world and W. So whatever is true of the\noccupant of R in W is true of the occupant of\nR in our world. The occupant of R in W is a\nsequence of, appropriately interrelated Plate-like objects. Hence the\noccupant of R in our world, that is Plate, is likewise a\nsequence of interrelated Plate-like objects.\n\nRecently Sider (2002) developed an argument for Four Dimensionalism\nfrom considerations about vagueness. He argues that Four\nDimensionalism is true if it cannot be vague how many things there\nare, and also that it cannot be vague how many things there are.\n\nIt should be noted that Sider and Katherine Hawley defend an\nalternative version of Four Dimensionalism which identifies objects\nwith what, on the first version, would qualify as their stages (Hawley\n2001, Sider 2002). In order to make this identification Sider invokes\nsomething close to Lewis\u2019 counterpart relation. Will the table I am\ncurrently looking at persist through the next ten minutes? According\nto the classical four-dimensionalist, otherwise known as the\nperdurantist, the table will persist through that period provided it\nhas a present and a ten minutes from now table stage that are both\nstages of the table without either one being identical with the table.\nIn contrast the stage theorist identifies the table with the present\nstage of the table. How can that be since the present table stage only\nexists now, and the table is supposed to be around ten minutes from\nnow? It can be, says the stage theorist, because, though the ten\nminute from now table stage is not now identical with the table, it\nwill be identical with the table. Moreover it will be identical with\nthe table since it stands in the appropriate counterpart relation to\nthe present table stage.\n\nStage theory enjoys the following advantage over classical\nfour-dimensionalism. Consider the case of a person fissioning into two\nlater people. A classical four-dimensionalist like Lewis will say that\nbefore the fission there are two separate people that cannot be told\napart. The stage theorist has no need to say that. Instead the stage\ntheorist can say there is a single present person who will be\nidentical with each of a pair of later individuals in virtue of\nstanding in the relevant counterpart relations to each one.\n\nIt should also be noted that four dimensionalism differs from\nChisholm's invocation of loose and popular identity in, at least, the\nfollowing way. The persistence of an object for any length of time\nwill, on a four dimensionalist view, require the existence of shorter\nlived objects setting aside the possibility of extended simples. The\npersistence for any length of time, on Chisholm's view, of a three\ndimensional object does not require the existence of shorter lived\nthree dimensional objects. It does not do so because the object\npersisting for a lengthy period may undergo no change of parts.\n",
