    "main_text": "Recent developments || Metaphor and Contemporary Linguistics\n5.1 Metaphor and Contemporary Linguistics\n\nIn the late 1970s, linguists interested in analogical reasoning and\nreading comprehension came to believe that pragmatic twist accounts in\nthe style of Grice and Searle could be subjected to rigorous\nlaboratory tests, using techniques originally developed for the\npsycholinguistics of reading. They reasoned that if metaphorical\nconstruals of language are based on prior literal construals and get\nconstructed and assessed only when available literal construals fail\nto equip an utterance with a contextually pertinent message, we should\nexpect subtle processing delays in the comprehension of metaphors,\ndelays absent from the comprehension of comparably familiar literal\nlocutions and idioms. And we should expect available metaphorical\ninterpretations of utterances to go unnoticed when they\u2019re\nirrelevant to the cognitive task at hand. An agenda-setting\nstudy by Ortony et al (1978) reported results broadly consistent with\nGrice and Searle. But before long further studies in the same style\n(Glucksberg, Gildea, and Booklin, 1982; Blasko and Connine, 1993)\nclaimed to have empirically refuted pragmatic twist theory. A search\nbegan for accounts on which metaphorical construals could be simple\nuniform functions of the literal consturals on which they are based,\nable to compete with literal rivals on a level playing field from the\nvery beginning of utterance processing.\n\nTwo such accounts became popular in the psycholinguistic community.\nAccording to the structure mapping approach of Dedre Gentner and her\ncolleagues, the content of a [novel] metaphor to the effect that\nlawyers are sharks consists of the true and novel part of what\u2019s\nsuggested about lawyers by the best available analogy between them and\nsharks (Bowdle and Gentner, 2005). According to the superordinate\ncategory approach of Sam Glucksberg, the class of metaphorical sharks\nis some broader class of things\u2014rapacious, relentless,\nravenous things\u2014with the property that it is typified by\ntypical sharks. (Glucksberg, 2001). Sympathetic reviews of this\nexperimental tradition and the theories it has inspired appear in\nGibbs (1994) and Holyoak (2019).\n\nIt\u2019s possible to wonder whether pragmatic twist accounts really\nhave the implications for real-time utterance processing that\npsycholinguists routinely take them to have. (Searle\u2019s account\nof how we can in principle work out metaphorical speaker\u2019s\nmeanings never purported to be a blow-by-blow narrative of real-time\nutterance processing. The more familiar and stereotyped a metaphorical\nconstrual gets, the more likely we may be to spot it and endorse it\nwithout considering and rejecting any literal rivals first. And\nGrice\u2019s theory predicts there will be situations where we can\nsafely conclude that a literal construal accords with the Cooperative\nPrinciple only after we consider and reject various of its figurative\nrivals.) It\u2019s possible to wonder whether structure mapping and\nsuperordinate category accounts can handle recalcitrant timing data\nany better than the Gricean competition. More recent studies suggest\nthat literal construals may have an especially urgent and timely claim\non our attention after all, see esp. Giora (2003).\n\nIn the 1980s a distinctive style of theorizing about language,\nthought, and meaning took shape in the work of Charles Fillmore,\nEleanor Rosch, George Lakoff, Ronald Langacker and their followers\nthat came to be known as cognitive linguistics (Lee 2001,\nCroft and Cruse 2004).\n\nCognitive linguists break with advocates of Chomskian generative\ngrammar, denying that the terms on which words intelligibly combine\nare set by brute hard-wired principles of universal grammar embodied\nin a special purpose language module. Instead, the terms on which\nwords meaningfully combine are a direct reflection of the terms on\nwhich certain strategies for conceiving concrete situations,\nstrategies the words serve to signal and evoke, can be successfully\ncoordinated with one another. They break with advocates of a Fodorian\nlanguage of thought, denying that conceiving or thinking is a matter\nof manipulating sentence-like discursive mental representations in\naccord with syntactically stated, truth preserving inferential rules.\nInstead, conceiving is a matter of manipulating unconscious mental\nimagery so as to let concretely pictured physical objects and\nsituations stand in for the more abstract objects and situations\nwe\u2019re endeavoring to understand.\n\nVerbal and nonverbal signs don\u2019t possess fixed meanings or\napplicability conditions independent of particular occasions of use.\nSigns prompt audiences to construct contextually appropriate meanings\nfor them afresh and on the fly, each time would-be communicators\nresort to them. Communication depends on the would-be\ncommunicator\u2019s ability to anticipate and purposefully manipulate\nthe spontaneous, largely unconscious constructions of meaning her\nsignals will elicit from her intended audience.\n\nConcepts are first and foremost techniques for coping with their\nsubject matters; only secondarily are they means of referring to\nparticular constituents of those subject matters for the purpose of\nframing discursively structured true and false thoughts about them.\nAnd talk of discursively structured thoughts needs to be\ntaken with a grain of salt. Tempting as it is to regard the meaning of\na concept as a matter of the mind-independent thing or kind or\nrelation to which it refers, tempting as it is to regard the content\nof a true or false thought as a matter of the mind-independent\nproposition the thought expresses, tempting as it is to regard the\nthoughts we think as arranging already meaningful concepts in much the\nway the sentences we speak arrange already meaningful words, such\nthinking underestimates the degree to which how we think is\nimplicated in what we are able to think and what we are\nable to think about. Talk of referents and propositional contents\nand logical forms belongs to a formalistic picture of what\nthinking is like, a picture which is at best an intermittently\nconvenient fiction.\n\nOur most basic concepts, our most basic coping strategies, are those\nwe employ incessantly in the course of purposeful voluntary bodily\nmovement executed in response to sense-perceptible features of things\nin our immediate spatial vicinity. These basic concepts sketch out a\nworld of discrete objects and discrete parcels of various physical\nstuffs (substances), laid out in space and changing over time as the\nobjects and substances in question come into existence, move about\nfrom place to place, and eventually go out of existence. They present\nthis sensorimotor world to us from a particular determinate\nspatiotemporal perspective, and characterize it for us more or less as\nfollows.\n\nThere\u2019s an inherent difference between horizontal and vertical\ndirections; with only one vertical direction but many different\nhorizontal ones. There\u2019s an inherent difference between higher\nand lower places, hence also an inherent difference between upward and\ndownward motion. Some objects are undifferentiated point particles;\nothers are extended, with distinguishable fronts and backs and sides;\na few have distinguishable tops and bottoms as well. (An\nobject\u2019s front is the part of it that normally faces forward as\nit moves and the part one normally needs to manipulate if one has\nserious business to transact with the object; a thing\u2019s top is\nthe part that is normally highest up, etc.) Some motions, the forced\nones, result from external influences on a moving object or substance,\npushes or pulls exerted on it by other objects or substances in its\nimmediate physical surroundings. Others, the spontaneous motions,\noccur at the initiative of the moving thing itself; these are physical\nactions on the part of physical agents. Some objects are hollow and\ncan accommodate other objects or substances within themselves, in an\ninterior place that moves around with them whenever they move around;\nthese are the containers. One place or object may be connected to\nanother place or object by a traversible path consisting of\nintervening locations. Such a path may be short, straight, and direct;\nor it may be long, crooked, and indirect. Objects and substances stand\nin relations of fitting, sticking, gripping, supporting and the like,\nand each of these relations has immediate consequences for how (and\nhow independently) the objects or substances in question can move.\nEtc.\n\nThe concepts that figure in the foregoing remarks outline a kind of\nfolk geometry, folk kinematics, and folk dynamics. The relations with\nwhich these concepts are concerned aren\u2019t the only immediate\nobjects of human experience: we are aware of some of our own emotions\nwith equal immediacy. But they are the most \u201cclearly\ndelineated\u201d objects of experience and those with which human\nthinking is most inevitably and incessantly concerned.\n\nWe exhibit these relations to ourselves and make inferences about them\nby means of simple diagrammatic mental images, images the unconscious\nemployment of which routinely mediates the planning and execution of\nour voluntary bodily movements: these are sensorimotor image\nschemas. We use these schemas to monitor and manage our ongoing\nactivities in the here and now, and to envisage possible future\ncircumstances and possible future activities when we speculate or\nplan. We may also employ them in imagistic demonstrations of important\ngeneral principles governing the geometric, kinematic, and dynamic\nrelations they serve to depict, truths such as:\n\n\n(1) If object x is in container c and c\nitself is in a second container d, then x is in\nd.\n\n(2) If object x starts out at a and travels\ncontinuously in a single direction along a direct path leading from\na to b, then x gets closer and closer to\nb at later and later times until it eventually arrives at\nb (if it ever does).\n\n\nSuch demonstrations are possible because once properly set up and\nproperly deployed, an image-schematic depiction is often found to\npossess reality-describing content in excess of what its constructor\ndeliberately imposed in the first place. When this occurs, the\ndepiction is treated by its constructor as carrying information (or\nmisinformation) concerning what situations of the kind she set out to\npicture typically are or necessarily must be like.\nSome of this excess information may be presented explicitly and\nstatically, so that she can simply read it off the face of the\ndepiction she has constructed. This is how we might demonstrate (1) to\nourselves. Such is structural inference. The rest of it is\npresented only implicitly and dynamically, so that she can retrieve it\nonly by setting her depiction in motion and letting its changing\nstates tell her how situations of the kind she set out to picture\ntypically would or necessarily must evolve over time. This is how we\nmight demonstrate (2) to ourselves. Such is enactment, also\ncalled simulation, elaboration, or running a mental\nspace. (For \u201cstructural inference\u201d and\n\u201cenactment\u201d see Lakoff and Johnson (2003), 257. For\n\u201csimulation,\u201d \u201celaboration,\u201d and\n\u201crunning a space,\u201d see Fauconnier and Turner (2002),\n42\u201348.)\n\nLakoff and his collaborators maintain that metaphor is at bottom a\nconceptual matter, a matter of thinking of one thing as and in terms\nof another. What Lakoff calls a conceptual metaphor or\ncross-domain map (e.g. love is a\njourney) is a standing pervasive culture-wide disposition to\nconceive one fixed sort of thing (e.g. love affairs), as and in terms\nof another fixed sort of thing (e.g. journeys). Such a cognitive\ndisposition sets up a standing correspondence between particular\nstandard love-affair concepts on the one hand and particular standard\njourney concepts on the other, with the effect that each time the\nrelevant conceptual metaphor is invoked (in connection, perhaps, with\na new pair of lovers),\n\n\nThe lovers correspond to travelers.\n\nThe love relationship corresponds to the vehicle.\n\nThe lovers\u2019 common goals correspond to their common destinations\non the journey.\n\nDifficulties in the relationship correspond to impediments to travel.\n(Lakoff 1993, 207)\n\n\nAnd so on. By exploiting these correspondences, we can and do redeploy\nfamiliar, easy patterns of thinking about one familiar sort of thing\nlending itself to direct sensorimotor representation (journeys) in\nnovel and strenuous bouts of thinking about a second, more elusive\nsort of thing (love affairs):\n\n\nThe metaphor involves understanding one domain of experience, love, in\nterms of a very different domain of experience, journeys\u2026\n(206)\n\nMetaphor allows us to understand a relatively abstract or inherently\nunstructured subject matter in terms of a more concrete, or at least\nmore highly structured subject matter. (244\u2013245)\n\n\nOver time this single cognitive disposition may manifest itself in\nmany different verbal expressions:\n\nOur relationship has hit a dead-end street\u2026 Look how far\nwe\u2019ve come. We can\u2019t turn back now. It\u2019s been a\nlong, bumpy road. We\u2019re at a crossroads. We may have to go our\nseparate ways. The relationship isn\u2019t going anywhere.\nWe\u2019re spinning our wheels. Our relationship is off the track.\nThis marriage is on the rocks. We may have to bail out of this\nrelationship. (206)\n\n\nWhat makes these verbal expressions metaphorical, according\nto Lakoff, is the fact that they are direct, conventionally\nstraightforward puttings-into-words of inherently metaphorical\nthoughts, thoughts constructed in the first place under the\nsupervision of the single conceptual metaphor love is a journey.\nActivate a conceptual metaphor; use it to think a metaphorical\nthought; put that thought into words in the usual routine manner,\nprovided for by the usual routine meanings of the words in question;\nand the result thereby counts as a verbal metaphor. Lakoff effectively\ndefines verbal metaphor as the conventionally straightforward\nputting-into-words of an inherently metaphorical conceiving, an\ninherently metaphorical thought. Such is the application to verbal\nmetaphor of the general cognitive linguistic principle that syntactic\nform is the direct expression of underlying meaning relations.\n\nA mental space is an arrangement of discrete concepts or\nimages deployed so as to represent some familiar recurrent sort of\nsituation. Imaginative manipulation of such a space allows us to\nanticipate the structure at a time and behavior over time of\nsituations of the sort it is designed to represent. Mental spaces\nrepresent ways things can be conceived to be in something of\nthe way possible worlds represent ways they could be. Gilles\nFauconnier (1994) proposed them as a basis for interpretations of\ncounterfactuals and propositional attitude constructions he viewed as\nsuperior to the standard truth conditional interpretations based on\nquantification over possible worlds.\n\nSuppose two such spaces, representing distinct sorts of situations,\ncan be viewed as contrasting enrichments of a single generic\nspace representing a more general sort of situation they\ninstantiate in differing and contrasting ways. Concepts or images in\nthe first space correspond to concepts or images in the\nsecond if they flesh out the same concept or image in the generic\nspace. One can then construct a fourth blended space deriving\nsome of its representational features from the first input space, some\nfrom the second, and still others from general principles of\nconceptual integration, in hopes that the result may\naccurately represent\u2014accurately anticipate the structure at a\ntime and behavior over time\u2014of some independently interesting\nsort of situation. Fauconnier and Turner (2002) offered a general\nframework for studying blended spaces and the conceptual integration\nnetworks that produce them. They envisioned diverse applications of\nthe framework to the study of informal reasoning and the\ninterpretation of ordinary language. One such application was the\ninterpretation of analogical metaphors of the form \u201cX is the Y\nof Z\u201d\u2014e.g. \u201cVanity is the quicksand of\nreason\u201d\u2014a matter Turner explores at length in his\n(1998).\n Conceptual metaphor theory and blending theory remain under active\ndevelopment. Comprehensive surveys of the field include K\u00f6vecses\n(2010) and Dancygier & Sweetser (2014). Objections to the approach\nare scouted in Gibbs (2017). A study relating variations in conceptual\nmetaphor to variations in subjects\u2019 perception of their own\nembodiment is in Littlemore (2019).\n",
