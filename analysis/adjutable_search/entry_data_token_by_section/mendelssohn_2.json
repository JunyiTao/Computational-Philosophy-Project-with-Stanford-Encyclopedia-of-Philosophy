    "main_text": "Rational psychology\n3. Rational psychology\n\nIn Phaedo or On the Immortality of the Soul, loosely modeled\non Plato\u2019s dialogue, Mendelssohn combines a paean to Socrates\nwith an elaboration of the dreadful personal, moral, and political\nimplications if a person\u2019s life is her \u201chighest\ngood.\u201d A best-seller of its time, running through three\neditions, this \u201cclassic of rational psychology,\u201d as\nDilthey put it, also contains an argument for the simplicity and\nimmortality of the human soul, explicitly singled out for criticism by\nKant in the second edition of the Critique of Pure Reason\n(for review of Kant\u2019s and Mendelssohn\u2019s different\napproaches to the question of immortality, see Guyer 2020, 142\u2013166).\nMendelssohn supports the notion that the soul is simple and thus\nindestructible by noting that certain features of the soul, namely,\nthe unifying character of consciousness and the identity of\nself-consciousness, cannot be derived from anything composite, whether\nthose composite parts be capable or not of thinking. \u201cWe would\nbe able neither to remember nor to reflect nor to compare nor to\nthink, indeed, we would not even be the person who we were a moment\nago, if our concepts were divided among many and were not to be\nencountered somewhere together, combined in the most precise ways they\ncan. We must, therefore, assume at least one substance that combines\nall concepts of the component parts\u2026. There is, therefore, in\nour body at least one sole substance that is not extended, not\ncomposed, but instead is simple, has a power of representing things\n[Vorstellungskraft], and unites all our concepts, desires,\nand inclinations in itself\u201d (Ph\u00e4don (2007), pp.\n119f (translation slightly altered)/Gesammelte Schriften,\n3/1, pp. 96f). As for the human soul\u2019s fate after death,\nMendelssohn appeals to divine goodness and providence, which perhaps\nexplains why, following the publication of the Phaedo, he\nfinds himself needing to revisit the proofs for God\u2019s existence.\nPlaying an important role in Mendelssohn\u2019s development of his\nviews of the human vocation and human immortality in the years prior\nto the composition of the Phaedo is a 1764\u201365 debate\nwith Thomas Abbt. On the topic of Thomas Abbt\u2019s role in this\nregard, his correspondence with Mendelssohn, and Herder\u2019s\ncritical reaction to Mendelssohn\u2019s views, see Pollok 2017 and\nPollok 2018b. For an insightful study of Mendelssohn\u2019s\nanthropology more generally, see Pollok 2010.\n",
