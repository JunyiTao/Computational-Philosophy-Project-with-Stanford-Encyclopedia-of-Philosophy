    "main_text": "Philosophical Assumptions in the Study of Animal Cognition || Simplicity\n2.4 Simplicity\n\nAnother aspect of the science of animal cognition where philosophical\nassumptions become evident is in the preference given to simpler\nexplanations of animal behavior. Simplicity has long been seen as a\nvirtue of scientific explanations, but it is notoriously difficult to\ndecide what makes one explanation simpler than another.\n\nIn comparative psychology, and especially when following\nMorgan\u2019s Canon, simpler explanations are taken by default as the\nnull hypothesis. This means that they are assumed to be true unless\nproven otherwise, and that the burden of proof falls on the side of\nmore complex explanations. For example, research into causal reasoning\nin animals takes as its null hypothesis animals\u2019 ability to\nlearn associations between different events. The experiments then\nprobe into whether animals are not just capable of this simple form of\nlearning, but whether they have the more complex capacity to\ncomprehend that some events cause others. When the\nexperimental data support both a simple hypothesis and a more complex\none, it is standard among scientists to prefer the simpler\nexplanation. For instance, some have argued that the experiments done\nto test whether animals are capable of metacognition (or thinking\nabout their thoughts) can in fact be passed by reasoning solely in\nfirst-order terms (or thinking about the world). Since first-order\nthinking is assumed to be a simpler explanation of the data, it has\nbeen argued that this explanation ought to be favored (e.g.,\nCarruthers 2003; Hampton 2009).\n\nThe idea that simpler explanations ought to be preferred is viewed by\nmany as self-evident, a result of applying Ockham\u2019s Razor to the\nstudy of animal cognition, and the claim that an explanation is\n\u201csimpler\u201d or \u201cmore parsimonious\u201d is often\noffered as the equivalent to \u201cEnd of discussion!\u201d However,\nin the past couple of decades philosophers have argued that this\npreference for simplicity in comparative cognition is much more\nproblematic than it may initially seem. For one, many have argued that\nthere is no reason why a simpler explanation will be more likely to be\ntrue in this context. Simpler explanations may have other virtues,\nsuch as being easier to understand or to describe, but since animal\nbehavior is the result of natural selection, and not the outcome of a\nprocess of intelligent design that infallibly delivers optimal\nsolutions, there is no reason to think that it is more likely to be\ncaused by simpler processes (Mikhalevich, Powell, & Logan 2017).\nIn fact, some have argued that when scientists claim a preference for\nsimpler explanations, it is actually some other consideration that is\ndoing the epistemic work, like the idea that we should avoid\nanthropomorphic descriptions of animal behavior (Fitzpatrick 2017a;\nSober 1998). We see this, for instance, in Shettleworth\u2019s\n(2010a) equation of simpler explanations with associative ones. She\nargues that associative explanations are to be preferred, but this is\nnot a result of a preference for simplicity per se, but stems from the\nidea that association is phylogenetically widespread in the animal\nkingdom, and so associative explanations are, in her view, more likely\nto be true.\n\nIn fact, there is no such thing as simplicity per se. Instead, what we\nhave are different types of simplicity depending on how and what we\nfocus on \u201csimplifying\u201d. Irina Mikhalevich (2017) has\nargued that simplification can be done through homogenization, by\naiming at fewer entity types; through reduction, by decreasing the\nnumber of entities; or through idealization, by removing entities that\nare not seen as crucial. Simon Fitzpatrick (2009) distinguishes five\ndifferent notions of the ideal of simplicity that are used in the\nliterature on comparative cognition:\n\nsimplicity as psychological unity (preferring explanations that\nunify different behaviors by positing a single cognitive\nmechanism);\nsimplicity as parsimony of mental representations (preferring\nX over Y as an explanation whenever Y entails\nX but not vice versa);\nsimplicity as less cognitive sophistication (preferring\nexplanations that attribute the least cognitively sophisticated\nmechanisms);\nsimplicity as analogy (preferring explanations that posit similar\ncognitive mechanisms to explain similar behavior in different\nspecies);\nsimplicity as evolutionary parsimony (preferring explanations that\nposit mechanisms inherited from a common ancestor to explain similar\nbehavior in different species).\n\n\nMike Dacey (2016) distinguishes further notions of simplicity, such as\na preference for those mechanisms that demand less computational\nmemory, time, or energy, those that require less input data, or those\nthat posit fewer changes in the phylogenetic tree. We previewed an\nargument along these lines in our discussion of anthropomorphism and\nanthropodenial\u2014which is simpler, positing a simpler cognitive\ncapacity and more changes over evolutionary time, or positing a more\nsophisticated cognitive capacity and fewer changes over evolutionary\ntime?\n\nThese different notions of simplicity are not only conceptually\ndistinct, they are often mutually incompatible or conflicting. Nowhere\nhas this become more evident than in the chimpanzee theory of mind\ndebate. The last few years have witnessed a huge controversy over the\nexperimental results in this research area. A number of studies have\nshown that chimpanzees can use information regarding what a competitor\nhas visual access to in order to decide whether or not to go for a\nreward (Hare et al. 2000; Hare, Call, & Tomasello 2001; Karg et\nal. 2015; Melis, Call, & Tomasello 2006). The controversy arose\nbecause these experimental results can in principle be explained by\npositing that chimpanzees were reasoning about the mental states of\nothers (in this case, about what they could or could not see), or that\nthey were solely reasoning about their behavior (e.g., about their\nbodily orientation or the existence of an uninterrupted line of gaze\nbetween their eyes and the reward). What is interesting about this\ncontroversy is that the defenders of each of these options were both\nclaiming to be offering the simplest explanation of the data. For\nMichael Tomasello and Josep Call (2006), it\u2019s more parsimonious\nto assume that chimpanzees can understand what others can and cannot\nsee rather than posit that they have learned a different behavioral\nrule for every relevant situation that involves a competitor\u2019s\nline of gaze. For Povinelli and Jennifer Vonk (2004), mental state\nattributions can only be inferred from another\u2019s behavior, which\nmeans that every mindreader must also be a behavior reader. Since the\nopposite is not the case, it\u2019s more parsimonious to assume that\nchimpanzees are behavior readers rather than mindreaders. The\nchimpanzee theory of mind controversy perfectly illustrates that the\nissue of simplicity is a philosophical one, meaning that the question\nof whether, to what extent, and in what sense simpler explanations\nought to be preferred is one that cannot be settled solely through\nempirical measurements or mathematical calculations, but requires\nphilosophical analysis and argumentation (for discussions, see\nClatterbuck 2017, 2018; Sober 2015).\n",
