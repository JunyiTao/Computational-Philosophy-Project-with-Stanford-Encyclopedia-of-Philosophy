    "main_text": "Political legitimacy and Public Health\n3. Political legitimacy and Public Health\n\nAs we noted in section 1.2, a distinctive feature of public health is the\nlarge role that government policy and government power play in its\npromotion. Although private non-profit actors, as well as pan-national\norganizations, make major contributions to advancing public\n health,[16]\n much of the work of public health occurs within nation-states and is\nbacked by governmental enforcement and the exercise of police powers.\nA substantial literature in public health ethics focuses on the\nlegitimacy of these state actions.\n\nChallenges to the authority of public health institutions and the\nlegitimacy of public health policies occur in a wide range of\npolitical contexts. In countries with distinctly illiberal political\ninstitutions, questions of state legitimacy are cashed out quite\ndifferently than in the liberal tradition. The public health ethics\nliterature has focused largely on the latter, relying on the liberal\ntradition as the touchstone for most writing on political legitimacy\nin public health. In Section 3, we address the major themes in this\nliterature. Section 3.1 considers how appeals to overall benefit, the\nnecessity of collective action, and efficiency are used to justify the\ngeneral mandate of public health agencies. Section 3.2 takes up the\nmajor strands of argument from within the liberal tradition that are\nused to assess the permissibility of particular policies or\n intervention.[17]\n After an overview of an influential heuristic developed to help map\nthe relative impact of various types of public health interventions on\nindividual\n liberty,[18]\n we turn to four different responses to concerns about the\nintrusiveness and legitimacy of public health policies and practices:\npaternalism (3.2.1); the harm principle, as attributed to John Stuart\nMill (3.2.2), the \u201cliberty tradition\u201d (3.2.3) and\nlibertarian paternalism (3.2.4)\n\nIn 3.3, we consider a different set of legitimacy-related concerns\nalso associated with liberalism that focus on the problem of how to\nrespect values disagreements among individuals affected by a public\nhealth policy. Here we take up two responses, an appeal to public\nreasons (3.3.1) and an appeal to authoritative decision-procedures\n(3.3.2). We then move in 3.4 to the civic republicanism view in public\nhealth ethics, which denies altogether the liberal presumption against\ninterfering with free and equal persons.\n",
