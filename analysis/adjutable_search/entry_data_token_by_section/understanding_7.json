    "main_text": "Special Issues in Epistemology || The Epistemic Value of Understanding\n3.1 The Epistemic Value of Understanding\n\nAs part of what Wayne Riggs has called the \u201cvalue turn in\nepistemology\u201d, epistemologists have increasingly attempted to\nidentify the fundamental bearers of epistemic value (Riggs 2008). From\na purely epistemic point of view, is knowledge of just any sort\nvaluable? Or is the fundamentally valuable thing instead the ability\nto provide reasons, or to possess beliefs that are in some way\n\u201cGettier proof\u201d?\n\nInto this mix some have argued that the really valuable things from an\nepistemic point of view are \u201chigher grade\u201d cognitive\naccomplishments, such as understanding or wisdom (Riggs 2003; cf.\nBaehr 2014). Thus by nature we do not seem to have any desire to\nacquire trivial pieces of information, such as the name of the 589th\nperson in the 1971 Dallas phone book. But any instance of\nunderstanding might seem worth pursuing or in some way worthwhile;\nthus Riggs writes,\n\n\nit seems to me that any understanding, even of some subject matter we\nmay consider trivial or mundane, contributes to the epistemic value of\none\u2019s life. (2003: 217)\n\n\nUnderstanding might therefore be a better candidate for a\nfundamentally valuable epistemic state than knowledge or truth.\n\nJust why understanding might have this property is up for debate. Some\nproposals focus on the \u201cinternal\u201d benefits that\nunderstanding is alleged to provide. According to Zagzebski (2001),\nunderstanding has a kind of first-person transparency, tied to an\nability to articulate reasons, that we do not always find in cases of\nknowledge. Thus to say a chicken-sexer knows the sex of a\nparticular chicken without being able to cite his or her grounds is\none thing, but to say that someone understands some subject\nmatter\u2014say, the U.S. Civil War\u2014without being able to\nexplain it or to describe how the subject\u2019s different elements\ndepend upon and relate to one another seems like another, more\nimplausible step (cf. Pritchard 2010). Understanding therefore\narguably provides \u201ca more natural home\u201d (cf. Kvanvig 2003:\n1993) for internalist intuitions in epistemology than knowledge,\nbecause it seems to more naturally appeal to notions such as\ntransparency, articulacy, and reason-giving than knowledge. (For the\nview that understanding too can be inarticulate, see Grimm 2017.)\n\nAnother view, from Pritchard (2009, 2010), is that any instance of\nunderstanding is valuable because it counts as an achievement, and\nachievements are the kinds of things that are distinctively and\nfinally valuable. Instances of understanding count as achievements\n(and indeed what Pritchard calls strong achievements) either\nbecause they involve overcoming an obstacle or because they bring to\nbear \u201csignificant cognitive ability\u201d. For Pritchard,\nhowever, the same cannot be said for any instance of knowledge. For\nexample, in many cases I might come to believe the truth on the basis\nof testimony, but the credit for my true belief seems to belong more\nto the testifier than to me (cf. Lackey 2007). I do not reach the\ntruth on this question primarily because of my ability or skill, but\nbecause of the ability or skill of the testifier; such items of\nknowledge therefore do not count as achievements, and hence lack final\nvalue.\n\nAgainst this, some have objected that there are many cases of\n\u201ceasy understanding\u201d where no significant obstacle seems\nto be involved, and no significant cognitive ability at play (e.g.,\nLawler 2019). For instance, it seems I could come to understand why my\ntumble-dryer isn\u2019t working\u2014because it is\nunplugged\u2014quite easily and without bringing to bear any\nparticularly significant cognitive ability (Carter & Gordon 2014:\n5). It has therefore been claimed that not just any item of\nunderstanding is valuable, and particularly not just any item of\n\u201cunderstanding why\u201d. Rather, only so-called objectual\nunderstanding is distinctively valuable, where objectual\nunderstanding is said to concern \u201cwide\u201d subject matters\nthat involve \u201ca large network of propositions and relations\nbetween those propositions\u201d (Carter & Gordon 2014: 8; cf.\nKhalifa 2017b: ch. 8).\n\nA final proposal is that understanding is a better candidate for the\ngoal of inquiry than knowledge (Pritchard 2016; cf. Kvanvig\n2003: 202 and Kelp 2021). Suppose you learn from a reliable source\nthat the rising and falling of the tides are due to the moon\u2019s\ngravitational pull. You will then apparently have knowledge of why the\ntides rise and fall, but according to Pritchard this knowledge will\nnot properly close your inquiry or satisfy your curiosity.\n\n\nIndeed, one would expect our subject to continue asking questions of\nher informant until she gains a proper explanatory grip on how cause\nand effect are related; mere knowledge of the cause will not suffice.\n(Pritchard 2016: 34)\n\n\nOn this view, an explanation of how cause and effect are related is\nessential to understanding why, and one\u2019s inquiry will not reach\nits natural end until one resolves this question.\n",
