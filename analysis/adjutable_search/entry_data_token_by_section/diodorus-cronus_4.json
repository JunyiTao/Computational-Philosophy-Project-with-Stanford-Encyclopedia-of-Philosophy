    "main_text": "Philosophical position\n5. Influence\n\n\nDespite the above characterization, Diodorus\u2019s philosophy did not\nprovide a comprehensive tripartite philosophical system\u2014physics,\nethics and logic\u2014of the kind that was to flourish in the ensuing\nHellenistic age. It is therefore unsurprising that his school did not\nlast far into the third century BCE. Instead, some of his key ideas\nwere appropriated by the dominant schools of the age, namely the\nStoics, the Epicureans and the sceptically inclined dialecticians of\nthe New Academy. Thus it was Diodorus\u2019s propositional logic (see\nDialectical School), rather than the logic of terms developed by\nAristotle, that became the basis of the remarkable Stoic logical\nsystem (see the entry on\n Stoicism \n\nin this encyclopedia, section 4, \u201cLogic\u201d). Diodorus\u2019s\nMaster Argument stood at the very centre of Hellenistic debates about\ndeterminism (see especially Cicero, On fate). His theory of\nminima was endorsed by Epicurus as a key part of his own physical\natomism (see the entry on\n Epicurus\nin this encyclopedia, section 3). And some of Diodorus\u2019s dialectical\nparadoxes, most notably the Sorites, became integral to the\nmethodology of the New Academy.\n",
