    "main_text": "Conceptual Issues in Determinism || The World\n2.1 The World\n\nWhy should we start so globally, speaking of the world, with\nall its myriad events, as deterministic? One might have thought that a\nfocus on individual events is more appropriate: an event E is\ncausally determined if and only if there exists a set of prior events\n{A, B, C \u2026} that constitute a\n(jointly) sufficient cause of E. Then if all\u2014or even\njust most\u2014events E that are our human actions\nare causally determined, the problem that matters to us, namely the\nchallenge to free will, is in force. Nothing so global as states of\nthe whole world need be invoked, nor even a complete\ndeterminism that claims all events to be causally\ndetermined.\n\nFor a variety of reasons this approach is fraught with problems, and\nthe reasons explain why philosophers of science mostly prefer to drop\nthe word \u201ccausal\u201d from their discussions of determinism.\nGenerally, as John Earman quipped (1986), to go this route is to\n\u201c\u2026 seek to explain a vague\nconcept\u2014determinism\u2014in terms of a truly obscure\none\u2014causation.\u201d More specifically, neither\nphilosophers\u2019 nor laymen\u2019s conceptions of events\nhave any correlate in any modern physical\n theory.[2]\n The same goes for the notions of cause and sufficient\ncause. A further problem is posed by the fact that, as is now\nwidely recognized, a set of events {A, B, C\n\u2026} can only be genuinely sufficient to produce an\neffect-event if the set includes an open-ended ceteris\nparibus clause excluding the presence of potential disruptors\nthat could intervene to prevent E. For example, the start of\na football game on TV on a normal Saturday afternoon may be sufficient\nceteris paribus to launch Ted toward the fridge to grab a\nbeer; but not if a million-ton asteroid is approaching his house at\n.75c from a few thousand miles away, nor if his phone is\nabout to ring with news of a tragic nature, \u2026, and so on.\n Bertrand Russell\n famously argued against the notion of cause along these lines (and\nothers) in 1912, and the situation has not changed. By trying to\ndefine causal determination in terms of a set of prior sufficient\nconditions, we inevitably fall into the mess of an open-ended list of\nnegative conditions required to achieve the desired sufficiency.\n\nMoreover, thinking about how such determination relates to free\naction, a further problem arises. If the ceteris paribus\nclause is open-ended, who is to say that it should not include the\nnegation of a potential disruptor corresponding to my freely deciding\nnot to go get the beer? If it does, then we are left saying\n\u201cWhen A, B, C, \u2026 Ted will then\ngo to the fridge for a beer, unless D or E or\nF or \u2026 or Ted decides not to do so.\u201d The\nmarionette strings of a \u201csufficient cause\u201d begin to look\nrather tenuous.\n\nThey are also too short. For the typical set of prior events that can\n(intuitively, plausibly) be thought to be a sufficient cause of a\nhuman action may be so close in time and space to the agent, as to not\nlook like a threat to freedom so much as like enabling conditions. If\nTed is propelled to the fridge by {seeing the game\u2019s on;\ndesiring to repeat the satisfactory experience of other Saturdays;\nfeeling a bit thirsty; etc}, such things look more like good\nreasons to have decided to get a beer, not like external physical\nevents far beyond Ted\u2019s control. Compare this with the claim\nthat {state of the world in 1900; laws of nature} entail Ted\u2019s\ngoing to get the beer: the difference is dramatic. So we have a number\nof good reasons for sticking to the formulations of determinism that\narise most naturally out of physics. And this means that we are not\nlooking at how a specific event of ordinary talk is determined by\nprevious events; we are looking at how everything that\nhappens is determined by what has gone before. The state of the world\nin 1900 only entails that Ted grabs a beer from the fridge by way of\nentailing the entire physical state of affairs at the later time.\n",
