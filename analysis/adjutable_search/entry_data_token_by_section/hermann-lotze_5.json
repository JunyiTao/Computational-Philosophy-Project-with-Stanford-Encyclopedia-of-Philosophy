    "main_text": "Three Contributions || Intuition\n4.1 Intuition\n\nThe Lotzean soul functions as \u201ca genuine stable point\u201d\n(Micro, I, p. 143); thus, as a substantial and\nself-determining principle of unity in consciousness, it is the\nfunctional equivalent of Kant\u2019s \u201ctranscendental unity of\napperception.\u201d The soul is, further, \u201cthe abiding source\nof sensation [i.e., cognition], of feeling [i.e., of emotion], of\neffort [i.e., volition]\u201d (Micro, I, p. 184). But it is\nalso, Lotze emphasized in contradistinction to Kant, always a\nparticular, embodied consciousness, living entwined in concrete and\nmanifold relatedness. And, even more importantly, it is equally\ncharacterized by its innate capacities for emotion and volition, and\nnot just cognition: the soul encompasses all of the capacities of\nhuman consciousness and is not restricted to merely intellectual\nfunctions. Further, the soul is insofar as it lives (cf.\nOutMet, pp. 43\u201344). (Indeed, one interpreter goes as\nfar as to suggest that Lotze embraced a\n\u201cphenomenological\u201d\u2014rather than a traditional\n\u201cmetaphysical\u201d\u2014notion of the soul, citing the\nstriking utterance: \u201cInsofern ist der Name der Seele ein\nphaenomologischer Ausdruck\u201d (cf. Sachs-Hombach, 1993, p.\n256).) But that there is such a soul is an undeniable conviction\ninspired by the only credible apprehension of human selfhood and\nagency.\n\nThe Lotzean standpoint was created both to appeal to certain\nHerbartian emphases and to contrast sharply with others, for Herbart\nhad modeled the soul (in part) on a Leibnizian monad: for him, it was\na single, simple, independent, unchanging, indestructible substance.\nAs such, it is utterly analogous to the one thing that, qua substance,\nunderlies the many, shifting properties, which it bears. Such\n\u201creals,\u201d which are absolutely simple, can, nonetheless,\nenter into causal relationships with other \u201creals\u201d (be\nthey souls or not). Hence, complex mental processes and psychological\nproperties are constructed on the basis of the properties and\nrelations of those \u201creals\u201d we may identify as souls. (As\nshall soon become apparent, this conception is utterly abhorrent to\nLotze, who embraces in its place, something that, at first glance,\nappears to be a form of phenomenalism, i.e., that to be a substance is\nnothing more than to appear as a substance.)\n\nA strong commitment to the concept of soul\u2014or mind or\nconsciousness as distinct from brain activity\u2014leads to a\nmetaphysical question about the very possibility of exact spatial\nlocality qua immaterial being. This, in turn, moves naturally to the\nprior epistemological issue of how the very perception of space is\npossible in the first place, given the essentially non-spatial\ncharacter of mental representations. As Lotze begins with the\nassumption that these representations are non-spatial, he must account\nfor how the soul can take the manifold of sensation and, subsequently,\nre-create the relative location of its elements in space. For if the\nbrain and the soul are indeed distinct, then no spatial configuration\nin the brain could account for our mental apprehension of spatiality.\nIndeed, an even more basic problem is to account for the way in which\n\u201cthe fixed situation of the variously stimulated nerve\nextremities\u201d becomes an object of consciousness at all\n(Micro, I, p. 307, cf. pp. 308\u2013309).\n\nSince spatial relations cannot proceed directly to consciousness,\nspatial localization is possible only if the non-spatial\nrepresentations are accompanied by \u201ca qualitative property of\nsome kind which the impression acquires \u2026 in virtue of the\npeculiar nature of the place at which it comes into contact with the\nbody\u201d (Micro, I, p. 309). Consciousness takes up this\naccompanying qualitative information, such that \u201cthey act as\nmarks or as local signs, under whose guidance it proceeds in spreading\nout the impressions into an image occupying space\u201d\n(ibid.). As one contemporary commentator observes: Lotze\ntheorized \u201ca close connection between the muscle sensation\nassociated with a sense organ and the local signs that accompany the\nsensations produced through stimulation of the sensory nerves of that\norgan\u201d conceived of as a \u201can innate anatomical\nmechanism\u201d (Hatfield, 1990, p. 160). This localization, Lotze\nbelieved, resulted from the \u201ccoloration\u201d produced not by\nany innate characteristics of the stimulated nerve but by the\nassociated motor impulses that will accompany stimulation of the nerve\n(cf. ibid.). It is only in such a way, Lotze contended, that\nnon-spatial perceptions can be reconstructed, in our intuition, into a\nspatial dimension (cf. Micro, II, p. 605). It is a matter of\nfurther discussion whether Lotze\u2019s theory of\nLokalzeichen accords best with contemporary (and competing)\nempiricist or nativist accounts (cf. Woodward, 1978).\n\nIn typical Lotzean fashion, the preceding discussion is held to be\nstrictly irrelevant in assessing the epistemic nature of spatial\nrepresentation. This stems, in part, as shall be discussed in the next\nsection, from the fact that Lotze insisted that mere stimuli\u2014and\ntheir concomitant relations of association\u2014do not, by\nthemselves, attain to the level of judgmental validity: the mental\nrepresentations which compose judgments proper are an accomplishment\nof the mind (consciousness, soul) alone. Hence, space is, as Kant had\nmaintained, epistemically ideal. In a rare, uncharacteristically\ncandid agreement, he admitted that \u201cthis kernel of Kant\u2019s\ndoctrine I accept unreservedly\u201d: \u201cspace and all spatial\nconnections are merely forms of our subjective intuition, not\napplicable to those things and those relations of things which are the\nefficient causes of all particular sensuous intuitions\u201d\n(Micro, II, pp. 603\u2013604). But Lotze affirmed this\npremises for reason quite different from Kant, for he believed that\nKant had rested his claim of \u201cthe ideality of space on the\nargument that the spatial form of the intuition must be innate\u201d\n(Hatfield, 1990, p. 163). While Lotze agreed that \u201c\u2026 it\nis not we who are in space, but it is space which is in us\u201d\n(OutRel, p. 53), this statement engenders no commitments\nabout the ultimate justification of intuitive statements.\n\nThe upshot of this approach is that not only does this remove\nconsiderations of spatiality from the noumenal realm, but also to\naccord a new epistemic status to intuition simpliciter: Lotze spoke as\nthough \u201cit is simply given to us in intuition (by inspection)\nthat between any two points only one straight line can be drawn; he\nreferred the \u2018first principles\u2019of geometry to the same\nbasis in intuition\u201d (Hatfield, 1990, p. 163). Hence, Lotze\ncounted the axioms of geometry as \u201cself-evident truths,\u201d\ntheir very self-evidence being grounded in their intuitive nature:\n\u201che conceived the role of intuition as that of revealing the\nself-evident\u201d (ibid.). This picture is further enriched\nwith Lotze\u2019s distinction of justification (logical) from genesis\n(psychological). On this view, psychological genesis (or the context\nof discovery) was irrelevant to the question of logical justification\n(or the context of justification). It is this approach that gives rise\nto an axiomatics, where the axioms were to be numbered among those\nthings identified as the self-evident truths. (However,\n\u201cself-evident,\u201d for Lotze, was often times invoked for an\naccomplishment of thought and, hence, not strictly identifiable with\nthe ordinary notion of the plainly \u201cobvious.\u201d)\n",
