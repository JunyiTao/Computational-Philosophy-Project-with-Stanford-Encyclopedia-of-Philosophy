    "main_text": "Meaning, Understanding and Testimony || Semantic Power and the Reduction of Semantic Properties\n9.2 Semantic Power and the Reduction of Semantic Properties\n\nThe Manual of Reason\u2019s definition of a word is\ncelebrated and often quoted. It says (TS 66) that a word is that which\nhas semantic power (\u015bakta\u1e43 padam). A sentence\n(v\u0101kya) is defined as a collection of words. So The\nManual of Reason\u2019s definition fits with the modern one,\naccording to which a word is a semantically significant sentential\nconstituent. Semantic power is that knowledge of which enables the\ncompetent hearer to interpret the word, and this, for the\nNaiy\u0101yikas, consists in the word\u2019s standing for an object.\nThus, someone who understands the word \u201ccat\u201d knows\nsomething of the form <\u201ccat\u201d means cat>, where\n\u201cmeans\u201d is a relation between words and objects of some\ntype. The Manual of Reason raises three questions about this\nrelation: (i) Is it a new and irreducible type or relation, not\nreducible, that is, to any of the relations already admitted (TSD\n66a)? (ii) What is the relatum, i.e. with what type of entity are\nwords semantically related (TSD 66b, k)? (iii) How do we learn the\nmeaning of a word (TSD 66c, d).\n\n(i) The M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas and Grammarians were\n\u2018essentialists\u2019 about meaning, arguing that the Sanskrit\nlanguage is a natural entity, independent of human convention or\nusage, whose words possess intrinsic semantic powers to signify\nobjects, just as fire has the intrinsic capacity to burn. The\nNaiy\u0101yikas traditionally opposed this view, arguing instead that\nlanguage is a product of convention, and that it is possible to\naccount for a word\u2019s semantic power in terms of stipulations\ngoverning its use. The claim is that we can define (and hence analyse)\nthe meaning-relation thus:\n\nx means y iff there is a decree/stipulation\n(sa\u1e45keta) of the form \u201cLet utterances of\nx generate cognitions of y\u201d.\n\n\nNow a stipulation or decree is claimed to consist in the\ndecree-maker\u2019s having a certain mental state, viz. a\n\u2018desire\u2019 or \u2018will\u2019 (icch\u0101) of\nthe form specified. Thus, the meaning relation is analysed in terms of\nmental states and their contents, and not as a new type of relation.\nWho is the decree-maker? The Manual of Reason states that it\nis God, but most later Naiy\u0101yikas drew a distinction between\nwords which have belonged \u2018endlessly\u2019 in the language\n(introduced by God) and words introduced by an explicit human\nstipulation (e.g. the technical terms in P\u0101\u1e47ini\u2019s\ngrammar).\n\n(ii) What is the meaning-relatum of a word like \u201ccow\u201d, a\ngeneric nominal expression? Here again The Manual of Reason\ncontrasts the Ny\u0101ya view with that of the\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas. One sub-school of\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas (the Bh\u0101tta) claim that the meaning of\n\u201ccow\u201d is the universal cowhood, since sentences like\n\u201c(The) cow is an animal\u201d, or injunctive laws like\n\u201cNever kick a cow\u201d, say something about the entire class\nof cows, not about any one individual. Thus:\n\n(Bh)\n\u201ccow\u201d means cowhood.\n\n\nIn reply to the obvious objection, that in many other sentences, such\nas \u201cThe cow is in the garden\u201d, a particular cow is\nreferred to, these M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas appeal to the idea that\na sentence can carry an \u2018implication\u2019\n(\u0101k\u1e63epa) other than its literal meaning. Thus the\nsentence \u201cThe cow is in the garden\u201d may mean literally\nthat cowhood is collocated with occurrence-in-the-garden (i.e. that\nthere exists a cow in the garden), but carries the implication that a\ncertain particular cow is in the garden. The principle here is that a\nprior awareness of the qualifier (vi\u015be\u1e63a\u1e47a)\nleads to an implicated awareness of the thing qualified\n(vi\u015be\u1e63ya) (TSD 66b). The Ny\u0101ya reply to this\nargument proceeds by way of rejecting the principle cited, for, they\nsay, awareness of a qualifier or universal is possible only via an\nawareness of the thing qualified.\n\nThe Manual of Reason states the modern Ny\u0101ya view: the\nmeaning of an utterance of the word \u201ccow\u201d is a particular\nindividual as qualified by cowhood\n(j\u0101ti-vi\u015bi\u1e63\u1e6da-vyakti):\n\n(Ny)\n\u201ccow\u201d means a-cow-as-qualified-by-cowhood.\n\n\nThe idea is this. Anyone who understands an utterance of the sentence\n\u201c(The) cow is in the garden\u201d does so by (a) identifying a\ncertain object as the referent of the word \u201ccow\u201d, and (b)\ngrasps that that individual is qualified by the property\noccurrence-in-the-garden. However, one can only identify an object by\ndistinguishing it from others, and this involves the use of a\ndistinguishing feature. So the individual is grasped in awareness as\ndistinguished/qualified by the feature cowhood. Since the meaning of a\nword is, by definition, its contribution to the final belief generated\nby hearing the utterance containing the word, the meaning of\n\u201ccow\u201d is an individual as qualified by cowhood. Note that,\non such a theory, token utterances of \u201ccow\u201d vary with\nrespect to the individual to which they refer, but every token\nutterance nevertheless shares a common semantic property, viz. \u201c\n\u2026\u2014qualified-by-cowhood\u201d. The Naiy\u0101yikas in\nthis way draw a distinction between type- and token- meaning (or, as\nsome say, between meaning and reference).\n\nThe other M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43aka sub-school (Pr\u0101bh\u0101kara)\nclaim that, in order to explain the fact that, on hearing a sentence,\nwe grasp a unified proposition and not just a list of entities, the\nmeaning-relatum of a word like \u201ccow\u201d is \u2018an object\nconnected with another\u2019 (itar\u0101nvita). The\nmeaning-relatum is a cow along with a \u2018hook\u2019 to link it\nwith other meaning-relata. More precisely, the meaning of the word\nwould be something like\n\n(Pr)\n\u201ccow\u201d means a cow-individual, which is\n     \u2026\u2026\n\n\nSo the sentence \u201cThe cow is in the garden\u201d does not just\nmean the list <cow, being in the garden>, as it would if each\nword simply designated an object, but rather the connected proposition\n<cow-which-is in-the-garden>. The idea, in effect, is that all\nmeaning-relata, are, in Frege\u2019s terminology,\n\u2018unsaturated\u2019. To this ingenious suggestion, The\nManual of Reason replies (TSD 66k) that it is superfluous, for\n\u201csince it is possible for the relation [between meaning-relata]\nto be apprehended as what is signified by the sentence [as a whole],\nit is not necessary to postulate a semantic power with reference to\nthe relation\u201d. In other words, The Manual of Reason\nclaims that general (presumably syntactic) features of the sentence\nare enough to connect the meaning-relata, without needing to claim\nthat those meaning-relata themselves do the connecting.\n\n(iii) The Naiy\u0101yikas offer the following account (TSD 66c) of\nlanguage acquisition. The child makes a series of observations\nconcerning the linguistic behaviour of adults. She hears adult A utter\na certain noise \u201cBring the cow\u201d say, and sees adult B\nperform a certain action, bringing of the cow. Again, she hears A\nutter the noise \u201cBring the horse\u201d, and sees B bring the\nhorse, and hears \u201cFeed the cow\u201d and sees the cow being\nfed. Then, by a twin inductive process, of (a) \u201cagreement in\npresence\u201d (anvaya) and \u201cagreement in\nabsence\u201d (vyatireka)\u2014i.e. noticing the\ncorrelation between A making or not making an utterance and B\nperforming or not performing an action, and (b)\n\u2018collection\u2019 (\u0101v\u0101pa) and\n\u2018rejection (udv\u0101pa)\u2014i.e. noticing the\nregularities between utterances of \u201ccow\u201d and events\nconcerning the cow, utterances of \u201cbring\u201d and bringing\nevents, etc., the child understands that the word \u201ccow\u201d is\nlinked with objects belonging the class of cows, etc.\n\nThis is an empiricist account of language learning reminiscent of the\naccount attributed by Wittgenstein to Augustine, and severely\ncriticised by him. Apart from the superhuman inferential powers\nattributed to the child, the problem highlighted by Wittgenstein is\nthat no amount of observation can show, for example, that the relevant\ncorrelation is between \u201ccow\u201d and cow-individuals, and not\nbetween \u201ccow\u201d and B\u2019s cow-directed-actions, the\nuniversal cowhood, heifers rather than cows, etc. (cf. TSD 66d).\n",
