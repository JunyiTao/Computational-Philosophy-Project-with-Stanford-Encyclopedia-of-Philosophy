Hermogenes\u2019 Conventionalism (383a\u2013386e)\n\nWhen Socrates agrees to join the debate between Hermogenes and\nCratylus, Hermogenes immediately bursts out with his own view of the\ncorrectness of names (384c\u2013e). Frustrated by the on-going\nquarrel with a recalcitrant Cratylus, he is probably hoping for some\nsort of support, or at least for clarity. However, Socrates reacts by\nasking questions and presenting arguments that do not make any\nimmediately recognizable contribution to the clarification of the\nissue at hand (384e\u2013386e). The present section will ascertain\nwhat Hermogenes wishes to claim and discuss the perplexing way in\nwhich Socrates responds to Hermogenes\u2019 contentions.\n",
