    "main_text": "Imitation || Mim\u00easis in Aristophanes\n2.1 Mim\u00easis in Aristophanes\n\nAuthors before Plato used mim\u00easis more vaguely than he\ndid, neither specially applying the word to a poetic process nor\nnecessarily implying its fraudulence \u2014with one important\nexception. The comedies of Aristophanes, obsessed with Euripides and\nwith tragedy in general (Birds 787, 1444; Clouds\n1091; Plutus 423\u20134), introduce comments about tragic\nstagecraft that say mimeisthai and mim\u00easis in\nconsistently pejorative ways.\n\nAlthough comedy is sometimes identified as antagonist to philosophy in\nthe \u201cancient quarrel\u201d Plato speaks of between philosophy\nand poetry (Most 2011), Aristophanes has also long been seen as\nPlato\u2019s precursor in the moralistic critique of poetry. They share\nconservative sensibilities that outweigh Aristophanes\u2019 slander of\nSocrates in Clouds (Nussbaum 1980). But Aristophanes\u2019\ninfluence on Plato extends, as commentators do not always recognize,\nto the nature of mim\u00easis. He uses that word in a\ntechnical sense that describes what actors do in a play, and with\nsuggestions of fraud or concealment.\n\nIn addition to Frogs with its face-off between Aeschylus and\nEuripides there is Women Celebrating the Thesmophoria, which\ncalls mim\u00easis a disruption of life and opposes it to\nnature. It can also be argued that Women Celebrating the\nThesmophoria finds an ambiguity in dramatic imitation that\nanticipates Plato; for in that play, as in the Republic,\nmim\u00easis combines composition and performance, the\ninvention of characters and the portrayal of them (Pappas 1999).\n",
