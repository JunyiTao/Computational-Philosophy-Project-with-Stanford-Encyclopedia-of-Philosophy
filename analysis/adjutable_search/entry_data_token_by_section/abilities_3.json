This supposition,\nwhich we may call the Rylean account of know how (since it is\nmost explicitly defended in Ryle 1949, 25\u201361), has been called\ninto question by Jason Stanley and Timothy Williamson (Stanley and\nWilliamson 2001). Let us briefly consider Stanley and Williamson\u2019s\nargument and how it bears on the theory of ability.\n\nStanley and Williamson argue, on broadly linguistic grounds, that our\ndefault view of know how ought to be rather different from Ryle\u2019s.\nPart of the argument for this is that standard treatments of embedded\nquestions (\u2018know who\u2019, \u2018know where\u2019, and so\nforth; see Karttunen 1977) suggest a rather different treatment. On\nthis treatment, to know how to A is to know a certain\nproposition. At first pass, in Stanley and Williamson\u2019s\npresentation, for S to know how to A is for\nS to know, of some contextually relevant way of acting\nw, that w is a way for S to A.\nStanley and Williamson develop and defend such a treatment, and offer\nindependent considerations for rejecting Ryle\u2019s own arguments for\nthe Rylean view. On their view, then, to know how to A is\nnot to have an ability.\n\nStanley and Williamson\u2019s arguments are far from widely accepted\n(see No\u00eb 2005), but they tell at the very least against simply\nassuming that an account of ability will also be an account\nof know how. So we will leave questions of know how to one side in\nwhat follows. It is also reasonable to hope that an account of\nability, while it may not simply be an account of know how,\nwill at least shed light on disputes about know how. For so long as we\nlack a theory of what an ability is, the precise content of the Rylean\nview (and of its denial) remains unclear. So it may be that getting\nclear on abilities may help us, perhaps indirectly, to get clear on\nknow how as well. (Additional discussion of these questions may be\nfound in Stanley\u2019s book-length development of his and\nWilliamson\u2019s initial position (Stanley 2011), as well as the\npapers collected in (Bengson and Moffett 2011).\n\nWhatever our view of ability and know how, there is a further question\nat the intersection of these topics that bears consideration. This is\nhow to accommodate those powers of agents that appear to be especially\nclosely connected to practical intelligence, such as skills and\ntalents \u2014 which we might collectively call the intelligent\npowers. Are the intelligent powers simply a species of ability,\nor do they demand an independent treatment? There are a number of\nrecent proposals to be considered here. (Robb forthcoming) proposes a\ndispositionalist theory of talent, on which a talent is a disposition\nto maintain and develop a skill. (McGeer 2018) emphasizes the\nsignificance of a distinctive kind of intelligent power, which she\n(following Ryle) calls an \u2018intelligent capacity,\u2019 and of\nwhich she too offers a broadly dispositionalist account. These\nproposals suggest a more general program of dispositionalism about the\nintelligent powers, which has suggestive parallels to the\ndispositionalism about ability that we will consider in Section 5.1.\nStill more generally, accurately accounting for the nature of the\nintelligent powers, and the relationship of these to abilities and to\nthe powers more generally, remains an open and intriguing problem.\n",
