    "main_text": "An Anatomy of the Debates || Genic Selection: The Originators\n3.3 Genic Selection: The Originators\n\nOne may understandably think that the early genic selectionists were\ninterested in the replicator question because of the claims that the\nunit of selection ought to be the replicator. This would be a mistake.\nRather, the primary interest is in a specific ontological issue about\nbenefit (Dawkins 1976, 1982a,b). This amounts to asking a special version of the beneficiary\nquestion, and the answer to that question dictates the answers to the\nother three questions flying under the rubric of the \u201cunits of\nselection\u201d.\n\nBriefly, the argument is that because replicators are the only\nentities that \u201csurvive\u201d the evolutionary process, they\nmust be the beneficiaries (Dawkins 1982a,b). What happens in the\nprocess of evolution by natural selection happens for their\nsake, for their benefit. Hence, interactors interact for the\nreplicators\u2019 benefit, and adaptations belong to the replicators.\nReplicators are the only entities with real agency as initiators of\ncausal chains that lead to the phenotypes; hence, they accrue the\ncredit and are the real units of selection.\n\nThis version of the units of selection question amounts to a\ncombination of the beneficiary question plus the\nmanifestor-of-adaptation question. There is little evidence that they\nare answering the predominant interactor question; rather, the\nargument is that people who focus on interactors are laboring under a\nmisunderstanding of evolutionary theory (Dawkins 1976, 1982a,b). One reason for\nthinking this might be that the opponents are taken to be those who\nhold a combination of the interactor plus manifestor-of-adaptations\ndefinition of a unit of selection (e.g., Wynne-Edwards).\nUnfortunately, leading genic selectionists ignore those who are\npursuing the interactor question alone; these researchers are not\nvulnerable to the criticisms posed against the combined\ninteractor-adaptation view (Dawkins 1982a,b; Williams 1966). Some\ninsist that the early genic selectionists have misunderstood\nevolutionary selection, an argument that is based upon interpreting\nthe units of selection controversy as a debate about interactors\n(Gould 1977; Istvan 2013); however, because the early genic\nselectionists say that the debate concerns the units of the\nultimate beneficiary, they are arguing past one another (Istvan 2013).\n Section 3.4, Genic Selection: The Pluralists,\n addresses those who interpret themselves as arguing against the\ninteractor question itself.\n\nIn the next few paragraphs, two aspects of Dawkins\u2019 specific\nversion of the units of selection problem shall be characterized. I\nwill attempt to clarify the key issues of interest to Dawkins and to\nrelate these to the issues of interest to others.\n\nThere are two mistakes that Dawkins is not making. First, he\ndoes not deny that interactors are involved in the evolutionary\nprocess. He emphasizes that it is not necessary, under his view, to\nbelieve that replicators are directly \u201cvisible\u201d to\nselection forces (1982b: 176). Dawkins has recognized from the\nbeginning that his question is completely distinct from the interactor\nquestion. He remarks, in fact, that the debate about group versus\norganismic selection is \u201ca factual dispute about the level at\nwhich selection is most effective in nature,\u201d whereas his own\npoint is \u201cabout what we ought to mean when we talk about a unit\nof selection\u201d (1982a: 46). He also states that genes or other\nreplicators do not \u201cliterally face the cutting edge of natural\nselection. It is their phenotypic effects that are the proximal\nsubjects of selection\u201d (1982a: 47). We shall return to this\nissue in\n section 3.4, Genic Selection: The Pluralists.\n\nSecond, Dawkins does not specify how large a chunk of the genome he\nwill allow as a replicator; there is no commitment to the notion that\nsingle exons are the only possible replicators. He argues that if\nLewontin, Franklin, Slatkin and others are right, his view will not be\naffected (see\n Replicators).\n If linkage disequilibrium is very strong, then the \u201ceffective\nreplicator will be a very large chunk of DNA\u201d (Dawkins 1982b:\n89; Sapienza 2010). We can conclude from this that Dawkins is not\ninterested in the replicator question at all; his claim here is that\nhis framework can accommodate any of its possible answers.\n\nOn what basis, then, does Dawkins reject the question about\ninteractors? I think the answer lies in the particular question in\nwhich he is most interested, namely, What is \u201cthe nature of the\nentity for whose benefit adaptations may be said to\n exist?\u201d[13]\n\nOn the face of it, it is certainly conceivable that one might identify\nthe beneficiary of the adaptations as\u2014in some cases,\nanyway\u2014the individual organism or group that exhibits the\nphenotypic trait taken to be the adaptation. In fact, some writers\nseem to have done just that in the discussion of group selection (see\nWilliams\n 1966).[14]\n But the original genic selectionist rejects this move, introducing an\nadditional qualification to be fulfilled by a unit of\nselection; it must be \u201cthe unit that actually survives or fails\nto survive\u201d (Dawkins 1982a: 60). Because organisms, groups, and\neven genomes do not actually survive the evolution-by-selection\nprocess, the answer to the survival question must be the replicator.\n(Strictly speaking, this is false; it is copies of the replicators\nthat survive. Replicators must therefore be taken in some sense as\ninformation and not as biological entities (see Hampe & Morgan\n1988; cf. Griesemer 2005).\n\nBut there is still a problem. Although the conclusion is that\n\u201cthere should be no controversy over replicators versus\nvehicles. Replicator survival and vehicle selection are two aspects of\nthe same process\u201d (1982a: 60), the genic selectionist does not\njust leave the vehicle selection debate alone. Instead, the argument\nis that we do not need the concept of discrete vehicles at all. This\nis what we shall investigate in\n section ",
