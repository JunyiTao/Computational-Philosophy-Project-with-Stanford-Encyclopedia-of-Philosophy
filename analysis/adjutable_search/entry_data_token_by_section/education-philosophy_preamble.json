    "main_text": "\n\nPhilosophy of education is the branch of applied or practical\nphilosophy concerned with the nature and aims of education and the\nphilosophical problems arising from educational theory and practice.\nBecause that practice is ubiquitous in and across human societies, its\nsocial and individual manifestations so varied, and its influence so\nprofound, the subject is wide-ranging, involving issues in ethics and\nsocial/political philosophy, epistemology, metaphysics, philosophy of\nmind and language, and other areas of philosophy. Because it looks\nboth inward to the parent discipline and outward to educational\npractice and the social, legal, and institutional contexts in which it\ntakes place, philosophy of education concerns itself with both sides\nof the traditional theory/practice divide. Its subject matter includes\nboth basic philosophical issues (e.g., the nature of the knowledge\nworth teaching, the character of educational equality and justice,\netc.) and problems concerning specific educational policies and\npractices (e.g., the desirability of standardized curricula and\ntesting, the social, economic, legal and moral dimensions of specific\nfunding arrangements, the justification of curriculum decisions,\netc.). In all this the philosopher of education prizes conceptual\nclarity, argumentative rigor, the fair-minded consideration of the\ninterests of all involved in or affected by educational efforts and\narrangements, and informed and well-reasoned valuation of educational\naims and interventions.\n\nPhilosophy of education has a long and distinguished history in the\nWestern philosophical tradition, from Socrates\u2019 battles with the\nsophists to the present day. Many of the most distinguished figures in\nthat tradition incorporated educational concerns into their broader\nphilosophical agendas (Curren 2000, 2018; Rorty 1998). While that\nhistory is not the focus here, it is worth noting that the ideals of\nreasoned inquiry championed by Socrates and his descendants have long\ninformed the view that education should foster in all students, to the\nextent possible, the disposition to seek reasons and the ability to\nevaluate them cogently, and to be guided by their evaluations in\nmatters of belief, action and judgment. This view, that education\ncentrally involves the fostering of reason or rationality, has with\nvarying articulations and qualifications been embraced by most of\nthose historical figures; it continues to be defended by contemporary\nphilosophers of education as well (Scheffler 1973 [1989]; Siegel 1988,\n1997, 2007, 2017). As with any philosophical thesis it is\ncontroversial; some dimensions of the controversy are explored\nbelow.\n\nThis entry is a selective survey of important contemporary work in Anglophone philosophy of education; it does not treat in detail recent scholarship outside that context. \n",
