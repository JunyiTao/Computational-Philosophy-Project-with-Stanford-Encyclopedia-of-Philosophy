    "main_text": "Mathematical explanation in the empirical sciences || Theories of explanation\n1.2 Theories of explanation\n\nTwo legacies of the Aristotelian tradition surveyed in section 1.1 are\nthat explanations require causes and that providing an explanation\nrequires giving an argument that turns on laws. Debates in the\nphilosophy of science since the 1960s have shown how one can privilege\none legacy over another (Salmon 1989). Hempel\u2019s\ndeductive-nomological analysis of explanation requires that an\nexplanation be a deductively valid argument from true premises, where\nat least one premise is a scientific law (Hempel 1965). Hempel and\nother empiricists in this broad tradition are wary of making causes\ncentral to explanation. This is apparent even in some of\nHempel\u2019s critics such as Kitcher, who emphasizes the unifying\npower of explanations. For Kitcher, an explanation is an instance of a\ndeductive argument scheme, where the schemes to adopt are identified\non the basis of global features of the claims we accept (Kitcher 1989,\nsee section 2.2.2 for additional discussion).\n\nBy contrast, Salmon\u2019s work has persuaded many philosophers of\nscience that explanations need only provide causal information about\nthe explanatory target (Salmon 1984, 1989). For Salmon and others in\nthis tradition, explanations do not require laws and need not even be\narguments. One development of this approach preserves Salmon\u2019s\nemphasis on causal mechanisms as a special sort of process. The\nso-called \u201cnew mechanists\u201d endorse a broader notion of\ncausal mechanism than Salmon allowed for, and identify an explanation\nof some target with a mechanism that produces it (Machamer, Darden\n& Craver 2000). Other approaches to causal explanation include\nDavid Lewis\u2019 counterfactual analysis of causation (Lewis 2004)\nand Woodward\u2019s interventionist theory (Woodward 2003, 2021a).\nDespite their differences, Lewis and Woodward allow for causal\nexplanations in the absence of mechanisms. This makes their approaches\nto explanation easier to generalize to non-causal cases.\n\nPhilosophical discussions of non-causal mathematical explanation can\nbe classified based on how they are related to these debates about\nscientific explanation more generally. One position argues for the\nneed to restore something like Hempel\u2019s emphasis on laws or\nKitcher\u2019s claims about unification (Baron 2019). Another\nposition generalizes from an account of causal explanation so that it\ncan include these mathematical cases (Saatsi & Pexton 2013,\nReutlinger 2016). Yet a third position is pluralist about explanation,\nand argues that explanations come in a variety of distinct sorts that\ncannot be fit into one or the other of these two options (Pincock\n2018, 2023).\n\nLange\u2019s extensive discussions of non-causal explanations can be\nseen as a valiant attempt to preserve the law-based approach to\nscientific explanation that goes back to Hempel (and Aristotle) (Lange\n2013, 2017). Lange\u2019s work on laws emphasizes how to identify\nclaims with the right kind of modal strength to contribute to\nexplanations (Lange 2009). Consider the contrast between \u201cAll\ngold cubes are less than 1 cubic mile in volume\u201d and \u201cAll\nUr-235 cubes are less than 1 cubic mile in volume\u201d. The former\nstatement is contingent, while the latter statement has some degree of\nnecessity. This allows the latter statement to contribute to an\nexplanation. Lange\u2019s approach to mathematical explanation\nextends this point so that mathematical claims can function in\nexplanations in a distinctive way due to their special degree of\nnecessity. This allows mathematics to contribute to what Lange calls\nexplanations by constraint that show how some outcome is guaranteed to\narise (Lange 2017, ch. 2). This is how Lange treats the strawberry\ndivision case and also cases like the bridges of K\u00f6nigsberg.\nOther mathematical explanations turn on the dimensions of the\nquantities involved or the statistical features of some process (Lange\n2017, ch. 5, 6). In each of these types of cases, the modal character\nof the mathematical claim allows it to explain just as the modal\ncharacter of ordinary scientific laws allow them to explain.\n\nUnsurprisingly, many philosophers have challenged Lange\u2019s\nproposals in ways that are reminiscent of how Salmon objected to\nHempel\u2019s deductive-nomological account (Pincock 2015a,\nReutlinger 2017b, Saatsi 2018). For example, Craver and Povich object\nthat, in the absence of a causal constraint on explanation,\nLange\u2019s proposals lack any suitable worldly basis, and so count\ntoo many representations of some target as explanatory (Craver &\nPovich 2017, Lange 2018a). As a mechanist about explanation quite\ngenerally, Craver seems inclined to dismiss the possibility of\nnon-causal mathematical explanations (Craver 2014). His co-author\nPovich has offered a more constructive proposal for these cases that\nallows for explanations with a variety of worldly or ontic bases\n(Povich 2020, 2021). Povich deploys a version of what amounts to a new\nconsensus for handling non-causal explanations: if a proposed\nexplanation relates to the right counterfactuals in the right way,\nthen it is legitimate (Woodward 2018, Rice 2021). However, there is as\nyet no agreement on what sorts of counterfactual tests are sufficient\nfor explanation (see Lange 2021a for some objections to this\napproach).\n\nOne option is to treat a mathematical claim like a law that governs\nsome situation, and to credit the mathematics with explanatory power\nwhenever it allows us to assess a range of counterfactual scenarios.\nThis is Reutlinger\u2019s proposal, which deliberately loosens the\nrequirements that Woodward places on interventions (Reutlinger 2016,\n2017a, 2018, Reutlinger, Colyvan & Krzyzanowska 2022). For\nexample, in the bridges of K\u00f6nigsberg case, the mathematical\nclaim indicates that a circuit of the bridges would be possible in the\ncounterfactual scenario where some of the actual bridges were absent.\nReutlinger concludes that the mathematical claim thus explains what is\ngoing on in the actual world by indicating what makes a difference to\nthe feature of interest. Arguably, though, this approach is too\nliberal. Suppose we ask why we have \\(81\\) stamps. It is a\nmathematical truth that \\(9 \\times 9 = 81,\\) and so we can arrange our\nstamps in a \\(9 \\times 9\\) array. So if we could not arrange our\nstamps in a \\(9 \\times 9\\) array, then we would not have \\(81\\)\nstamps. But the truth that \\(9 \\times 9 = 81\\) does not explain why we\nhave \\(81\\) stamps.\n\nAnother option is to treat a mathematical claim like a cause. Then the\nclaim will be explanatory when a \u201ccounter-mathematical\u201d\nthat supposes that this claim is false winds up making a difference to\nthe target in question. This sort of counter-mathematical involves\nimpossible worlds where necessary truths come out false. This is the\noption that Povich takes (Povich 2020, 2021). Another family of\nproposals along these lines has been developed by Baron in\ncollaboration with Colyvan and Ripley (Baron, Colyvan & Ripley\n2017, 2020). Baron et al. draw on David Lewis\u2019 procedure for\nevaluating counterfactuals tied to causation: consider the scenario\nthat arises through a miraculous change that is just enough of a\nchange to make the antecedent of the counterfactual true. In addition,\nBaron et al. require that the features of the natural world that are\nimplicated in this shift in the mathematics be changed in a\ncorresponding way. For example, for the cicada case, the central\nmathematical claim is that prime periods minimize intersections when\ncompared to non-prime periods. So among the years 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,\n17, and 18 (that are identified by ecological constraints), the primes\n13 and 17 stand out as comparatively more fit. Baron et al. consider\nthe consequences of supposing that 13 is not prime. If 13 was not\nprime, they argue, then it would have factors besides 1 and 13, and so\nhaving a 13-year life cycle would not confer any relative fitness\nadvantage. Thus, in this impossible world, the cicadas would not have\nevolved a 13-year life cycle. This is meant to show that 13\u2019s\nbeing prime makes a difference to the evolution of 13-year life cycle\ncicadas. (See also section 2.2.1 for a parallel debate for pure\nmathematics.)\n\nThere are pressing questions for these proposals about the nature of\nimpossible worlds and our epistemic access to them (Kasirzadeh 2021a).\nAnother sort of objection has been raised by Baron himself in work\nthat develops another account of mathematical explanation (Baron\n2020). Baron, like Baker and Lange, aims to identify a special class\nof genuinely or distinctively mathematical explanations of natural\nphenomena (Baker 2005, 2009a, Lange 2013). What is special about these\ncases is that the mathematics explains, but not by representing or\ndescribing some non-mathematical explainers such as causes or other\nworldly difference makers. Baron\u2019s general worry is that simply\nusing countermathematicals fails to distinguish explanations that\nemploy mathematics from these genuinely mathematical explanations. We\ncan see this using our original stamp case: why can we arrange our\nstamps in a \\(9 \\times 9\\) array? Because we have \\(81\\) stamps and\n\\(9 \\times 9 = 81.\\) This case passes Baron et al.\u2019s\ncountermathematical test, for were \\(9 \\times 9\\) not equal to \\(81\\),\nthen our \\(81\\) stamps could not be arranged in a \\(9 \\times 9\\)\narray. However, the mathematical claim here seems to be simply\ntracking the non-mathematical features of the stamps, and so Baron and\nothers would not want to count this as a special sort of mathematical\nexplanation.\n\nBaron concludes that some additional requirements must be imposed\nbeyond the truth of the relevant countermathematical. Here Baron\nreaches back to Kitcher\u2019s idea that explanations are instances\nof a special sort of argument scheme (Kitcher 1989), where the schemes\nare found through a process of appropriately unifying the claims that\nwe accept (for objections to this proposal see Pincock 2023 and Povich\nforthcoming). Other recent work on non-causal mathematical\nexplanations also seems to be returning to some of the original\nsources of these debates. For example, Lange argues that the best way\nto make sense of the explanatory power of pure mathematics in the\nempirical sciences is to adopt an Aristotelian interpretation of pure\nmathematics (Lange 2021b).\n\nLyon proposed another way of relating mathematical explanations to\ncausal explanations by adapting Jackson and Pettit\u2019s notion of a\n\u201cprogram explanation\u201d (Jackson & Pettit 1990). A\nprogram explanation does not invoke a property that causes the outcome\nof interest. Instead, the explanation appeals to a property \\(A\\) that\nguarantees the presence of some member of a family of properties,\nwhere some such property \\(B\\) causes the outcome of interest. As Lyon\nsummarizes his proposal, \u201cAn explanation of an empirical fact is\nmathematical \u2013 i.e., it has mathematics doing explanatory work\n\u2013 if the explanation is a program explanation that uses\nmathematics in a way that is indispensable to the program\u201d (Lyon\n2012, 568). One concern with this proposal is that it includes cases\nwhere the mathematics merely represents some causally relevant\nproperty, as with the stamps case noted above: programming is too\nindiscriminate a relation to avoid this worry (Saatsi 2012).\n\nA sweeping way of dealing with the apparent tension between causes and\nmathematics has been pursued by some ontic structural realists\n(Ladyman & Ross 2007, French 2014). They identify the fundamental\nmetaphysical structure of the world with a mathematical structure. If\none adopted this kind of structural realism, then the explanatory\npower of mathematics in the empirical sciences would receive a\nsatisfying analysis. In fundamental physics, scientists would be\nworking with the fundamental mathematical structure directly, and so\nexplanations there would be essentially mathematical. In\nnon-fundamental domains such as biology or economics, scientists would\nbe investigating features of the world that are ultimately grounded in\nsome mathematical structure. So again it would make sense for many of\nthe explanations in non-fundamental sciences to be mathematical.\nCausal explanations would then turn out to be perfectly consistent\nwith more fundamental mathematical explanations. Few philosophers are\nwilling to adopt such a metaphysical position in order to resolve\nquestions about mathematical explanation, although at least one\nphysicist has defended this approach (Tegmark 2014).\n\nAnother, less metaphysical, solution to these difficulties is to\nretain an account of how causal explanations work and to simply\nsupplement it with a distinct account of how various kinds of\nnon-causal explanations arise (Pincock 2015a, Pincock 2018, with\ncriticisms from Knowles 2021a). This sort of explanatory pluralism is\nalso reminiscent of one aspect of the Aristotelian tradition. One\nchallenge for the explanatory pluralist is to make sense of the value\nthat scientists ascribe to explanations: how can there be some special\nvalue in having an explanation if explanations come in different kinds\nthat have nothing in common? One response to this challenge is that\ngrasping an explanation produces scientific understanding, but the\nnature and value of this scientific understanding remains a subject of\nactive debate (Rice & Rohwer 2021). Another response is to defend\na restrictive form of explanatory monism. It may turn out that this\nmonism about explanation is so restrictive that there are no\nmathematical explanations in science (Zelcer 2013, Kuorikoski 2021).\nThis is reminiscent of one side of the Renaissance debate noted in\nsection 1.1.\n\nAnother sort of pluralism arises from supposing that causal\nexplanations involve the mechanisms championed by the new mechanists,\nand then allowing for other sorts of explanations that work in\ndifferent ways. One type of case that has received extensive\ndiscussion is so-called \u201ctopological\u201d explanation. These\nexplanations appeal to structural or network-based features to explain\nan aspect of a system (Kostic 2020, 2023, Ross 2021). One position is\nthat topological explanations are non-causal, non-mechanical\nexplanations that are based on a different kind of explanatorily\nrelevant feature. For example, Kostic and Khalifa argue that a\nnon-ontic approach that privileges scientist\u2019s explanatory goals\nis needed to make sense of topological explanation (Kostic &\nKhalifa 2021, 2022). Another position is that an appropriately\nflexible notion of mechanism can count genuine topological\nexplanations as mechanical explanations (Bechtel & Abrahamsen\n2010, Bechtel 2020, Huneman 2010, 2018, Brigandt 2013, Green et al.\n2018). As with the debates arising from Woodward\u2019s and\nLewis\u2019 counterfactual approaches to causal explanation, the main\nquestion is what counts as a mechanism and how non-mechanisms can be\nexplanatory (Janson 2018, Janson & Saatsi 2019, Andersen 2020, Jha\net al. 2022).\n\nMore recently, some authors have tried to restore some kind of\nexplanatory monism by arguing that all scientific explanations turn on\nnon-representational, expressive elements (McCullough-Benner 2022,\nHunt forthcoming). If this was right, then there would be no\ndifficulty making sense of mathematical explanations so long as\nmathematics can be seen to perform whatever expressive function an\nauthor identifies. The viability of an expressive approach thus turns\non questions about the interpretation of pure mathematics that are\nconsidered in sections 1.4 and 2.2.\n",
