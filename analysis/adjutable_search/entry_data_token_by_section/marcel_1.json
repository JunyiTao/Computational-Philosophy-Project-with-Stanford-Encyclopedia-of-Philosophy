    "main_text": "The Broken World and the Functional Person\n2. The Broken World and the Functional Person\n\nIn line with his preference for concrete philosophy that speaks in\nordinary language, Marcel begins many of his philosophical essays with\nan observation about life. One of his central observations about life\nand experience, from which he is able to derive many of the\nphilosophical distinctions that follow, is that we live in a\n\u201cbroken world.\u201d A world in which \u201contological\nexigence\u201d\u2014if it is acknowledged at all\u2014is\nsilenced by an unconscious relativism or by a monism that discounts\nthe personal, \u201cignores the tragic and denies the\ntranscendent\u201d (Marcel 1995, p. 15). The characterization of the\nworld as broken does not necessarily imply that there was a time when\nthe world was intact. It would be more correct to emphasize that the\nworld we live in is essentially broken, broken in essence, in addition\nto having been further fractured by events in history. The observation\nis intended to point out that we find ourselves hic et nunc\nin a world that is broken. This situation is characterized by a\nrefusal (or inability) to reflect, a refusal to imagine and a denial\nof the transcendent (Marcel 1951a, pp. 36\u201337). Although many\nthings contribute to the \u201cbrokenness\u201d of the world, the\nhallmark of its modern manifestation is \u201cthe misplacement of the\nidea of function\u201d (Marcel 1995, p. 11).\n\n\u201cI should like to start,\u201d Marcel says, \u201cwith a sort\nof global and intuitive characterization of the man in whom the sense\nof the ontological\u2014the sense of being, is lacking, or, to speak\nmore correctly, the man who has lost awareness of this sense\u201d\n(Marcel 1995, p. 9). This person, the one who has lost awareness of\nthe sense of the ontological, the one whose capacity to wonder has\natrophied to the extent of becoming a vestigial trait, is an example\nof the influence of the misapplication of the idea of function. Marcel\nuses the example of a subway token distributor. This person has a job\nthat is mindless, repetitive, and monotonous. The same function can\nbe, and often is, completed by automated machines. All day this person\ntakes bills from commuters and returns a token and some change,\nrepeating the same process with the same denominations of currency,\nover and over. The other people with whom she interacts engage her in\nonly the most superficial and distant manner. In most cases, they do\nnot speak to her and they do not make eye contact. In fact, the only\ndistinction the commuters make between such a person and the\nautomatic, mechanical token dispenser down the hall is to note which\n\u201cmachine\u201d has the shorter line. The way in which these\ncommuters interact with this subway employee is clearly superficial\nand less than desirable. However, Marcel\u2019s point is more\nsubtle.\n\nWhat can the inner reality of such a person be like? What began as\ntedious work slowly becomes infuriating in its monotony, but\neventually passes into a necessity that is accepted with indifference,\nuntil even the sense of dissatisfaction with the pure functionalism of\nthe task is lost. The unfortunate truth is that such a person may come\nto see herself, at first unconsciously, as merely an amalgamation of\nthe functions she performs. There is the function of dispensing tokens\nat work, the function of spouse and parent at home, the function of\nvoting as a citizen of a given country, etc. Her life operates on a\nseries of \u201ctime-tables\u201d that indicate when certain\nfunctions\u2014such as the yearly maintenance trip to the doctor, or\nthe yearly vacation to rest and recuperate\u2014are to be exercised.\nIn this person the sense of wonder and the exigence for the\ntranscendent may slowly begin to wither and die. In the most extreme\ncases, a person who has come to identify herself with her functions\nceases to even have any intuition that the world is broken.\n\nA corollary of the functionalism of the modern broken world is its\nhighly technical nature. Marcel characterizes a world such as\nours\u2014in which everything and everyone becomes viewed in terms of\nfunction, and in which all questions are approached with\ntechnique\u2014as one that is dominated by its\n\u201ctechnics.\u201d This is evident in the dependence on\ntechnology, the immediate deferral to the technological as the answer\nto any problem, and the tendency to think of technical reasoning as\nthe only mode of access to the truth. However, it is clear that there\nare some \u201cproblems\u201d that cannot be addressed with\ntechnique, and this is disquieting for persons who have come to rely\non technics. While technology undoubtedly has its proper place and\nuse, the deification of technology leads to despair when we realize\nthe ultimate inefficacy of technics regarding important existential\nquestions. It is precisely this misapplication of the idea of function\nand the dependence on technics that leads to the despair that is so\nprevalent in the broken world. Obviously, we cannot turn back the\nclock with regard to technological progress, and Marcel acknowledges\nthat technology is not necessarily detrimental to the life of the\nspirit; nevertheless, it often is, because: \u201cdoes not the\ninvasion of our life by techniques today tend to substitute\nsatisfaction at a material level for spiritual joy, dissatisfaction at\na material level for spiritual disquiet?\u201d (Marcel 1985, p.\n57).\n\n",
