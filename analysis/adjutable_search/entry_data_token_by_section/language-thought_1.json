    "main_text": "Mental Language || The Representational Theory of Thought\n1.1 The Representational Theory of Thought\n\nFolk psychology routinely explains and predicts behavior by citing\nmental states, including beliefs, desires, intentions, fears, hopes,\nand so on. To explain why Mary walked to the refrigerator, we might\nnote that she believed there was orange juice in the refrigerator and\nwanted to drink orange juice. Mental states such as belief and desire\nare called propositional attitudes. They can be specified\nusing locutions of the form\n\n\nX believes that p.\n\nX desires that p.\n\nX intends that p.\n\nX fears that p.\n\netc.\n\n\nBy replacing \u201cp\u201d with a sentence, we specify the\ncontent of X\u2019s mental state. Propositional attitudes have\n intentionality\n or aboutness: they are about a subject matter. For that\nreason, they are often called intentional states.\n\nThe term \u201cpropositional attitude\u201d originates with Russell\n(1918\u20131919 [1985]) and reflects his own preferred analysis: that\npropositional attitudes are relations to\n propositions.\n A proposition is an abstract entity that determines a\ntruth-condition. To illustrate, suppose John believes that\nParis is north of London. Then John\u2019s belief is a relation to\nthe proposition that Paris is north of London, and this\nproposition is true iff Paris is north of London. Beyond the thesis\nthat propositions determine truth-conditions, there is little\nagreement about what propositions are like. The literature offers many\noptions, mainly derived from theories of Frege (1892 [1997]), Russell\n(1918\u20131919 [1985]), and Wittgenstein (1921 [1922]).\n\nFodor (1981: 177\u2013203; 1987: 16\u201326) proposes a theory of\npropositional attitudes that assigns a central role to mental\nrepresentations. A\n mental representation\n is a mental item with semantic properties (such as a\ndenotation, or a meaning, or a truth-condition, etc.). To believe that\np, or hope that p, or intend that p, is to bear\nan appropriate relation to a mental representation whose meaning is\nthat p. For example, there is a relation belief* between\nthinkers and mental representations, where the following biconditional\nis true no matter what English sentence one substitutes for\n\u201cp\u201d:\n\n\nX believes that p iff there is a mental representation\nS such that X believes* S and S means that\np.\n\n\nMore generally:\n\n(1) Each propositional\nattitude A corresponds to a unique psychological relation\nA*, where the following biconditional is true no matter what\nsentence one substitutes for \u201cp\u201d: X\nAs that p iff there is a mental representation\nS such that X bears A* to S and S\nmeans that p.\n\n\nOn this analysis, mental representations are the most direct objects\nof propositional attitudes. A propositional attitude inherits its\nsemantic properties, including its truth-condition, from the mental\nrepresentation that is its object.\n\nProponents of (1) typically invoke\n functionalism\n to analyze A*. Each psychological relation A* is\nassociated with a distinctive functional role: a role that\nS plays within your mental activity just in case you bear\nA* to S. When specifying what it is to believe*\nS, for example, we might mention how S serves as a basis\nfor inferential reasoning, how it interacts with desires to produce\nactions, and so on. Precise functional roles are to be discovered by\nscientific psychology. Following Schiffer (1981), it is common to use\nthe term \u201cbelief-box\u201d as a placeholder for the functional\nrole corresponding to belief*: to believe* S is to place\nS in your belief box. Similarly for \u201cdesire-box\u201d,\netc.\n\n(1) is compatible with the view that propositional attitudes are\nrelations to propositions. One might analyze the locution\n\u201cS means that p\u201d as involving a relation\nbetween S and a proposition expressed by S. It would\nthen follow that someone who believes* S stands in a\npsychologically important relation to the proposition expressed by\nS. Fodor (1987: 17) adopts this approach. He combines a\ncommitment to mental representations with a commitment to\npropositions. In contrast, Field (2001: 30\u201382) declines to\npostulate propositions when analyzing \u201cS means that\np\u201d. He posits mental representations with semantic\nproperties, but he does not posit propositions expressed by the mental\nrepresentations.\n\nThe distinction between\n types and tokens\n is crucial for understanding (1). A mental representation is a\nrepeatable type that can be instantiated on different occasions. In\nthe current literature, it is generally assumed that a mental\nrepresentation\u2019s tokens are neurological. For present purposes,\nthe key point is that mental representations are instantiated by\nmental events. Here we construe the category of\n events\n broadly so as to include both occurrences (e.g., I form an\nintention to drink orange juice) and enduring states (e.g.,\nmy longstanding belief that Abraham Lincoln was president of the\nUnited States). When mental event e instantiates representation\nS, we say that S is tokened and that e\nis a tokening of S. For example, if I believe that\nwhales are mammals, then my belief (a mental event) is a tokening of a\nmental representation whose meaning is that whales are mammals.\n\nAccording to Fodor (1987: 17), thinking consists in chains of mental\nevents that instantiate mental representations:\n\n(2) Thought processes\nare causal sequences of tokenings of mental\nrepresentations.\n\n\nA paradigm example is deductive inference: I transition from\nbelieving* the premises to believing* the conclusion. The first mental\nevent (my belief* in the premises) causes the second (my belief* in\nthe conclusion).\n\n(1) and (2) fit together naturally as a package that one might call\nthe representational theory of thought (RTT). RTT postulates\nmental representations that serve as the objects of propositional\nattitudes and that constitute the domain of thought\n processes.[1]\n\nRTT as stated requires qualification. There is a clear sense in which\nyou believe that there are no elephants on Jupiter. However, you\nprobably never considered the question until now. It is not plausible\nthat your belief box previously contained a mental representation with\nthe meaning that there are no elephants on Jupiter. Fodor (1987:\n20\u201326) responds to this sort of example by restricting (1) to\ncore cases. Core cases are those where the propositional\nattitude figures as a causally efficacious episode in a mental\nprocess. Your tacit belief that there are no elephants on Jupiter does\nnot figure in your reasoning or decision-making, although it can come\nto do so if the question becomes salient and you consciously judge\nthat there are no elephants on Jupiter. So long as the belief remains\ntacit, (1) need not apply. In general, Fodor says, an intentional\nmental state that is causally efficacious must involve explicit\ntokening of an appropriate mental representation. In a slogan:\n\u201cNo Intentional Causation without Explicit Representation\u201d\n(Fodor 1987: 25). Thus, we should not construe (1) as an attempt at\nfaithfully analyzing informal discourse about propositional attitudes.\nFodor does not seek to replicate folk psychological categories. He\naims to identify mental states that resemble the propositional\nattitudes adduced within folk psychology, that play roughly similar\nroles in mental activity, and that can support systematic\ntheorizing.\n\nDennett\u2019s (1977 [1981]) review of The Language of\nThought raises a widely cited objection to RTT:\n\n\nIn a recent conversation with the designer of a chess-playing program\nI heard the following criticism of a rival program: \u201cit thinks\nit should get its queen out early\u201d. This ascribes a\npropositional attitude to the program in a very useful and predictive\nway, for as the designer went on to say, one can usefully count on\nchasing that queen around the board. But for all the many levels of\nexplicit representation to be found in that program, nowhere is\nanything roughly synonymous with \u201cI should get my queen out\nearly\u201d explicitly tokened. The level of analysis to which the\ndesigner\u2019s remark belongs describes features of the program that\nare, in an entirely innocent way, emergent properties of the\ncomputational processes that have \u201cengineering reality\u201d. I\nsee no reason to believe that the relation between belief-talk and\npsychological talk will be any more direct.\n\n\nIn Dennett\u2019s example, the chess-playing machine does not\nexplicitly represent that it should get the queen out early, yet in\nsome sense it acts upon a belief that it should do so. Analogous\nexamples arise for human cognition. For example, we often follow rules\nof deductive inference without explicitly representing the rules.\n\nTo assess Dennett\u2019s objection, we must distinguish sharply\nbetween mental representations and rules governing the manipulation of\nmental representations (Fodor 1987: 25). RTT does not require that\nevery such rule be explicitly represented. Some rules may be\nexplicitly represented\u2014we can imagine a reasoning system that\nexplicitly represents deductive inference rules to which it conforms.\nBut the rules need not be explicitly represented. They may\nmerely be implicit in the system\u2019s operations. Only when\nconsultation of a rule figures as a causally efficacious episode in\nmental activity does RTT require that the rule be explicitly\nrepresented. Dennett\u2019s chess machine explicitly represents chess\nboard configurations and perhaps some rules for manipulating chess\npieces. It never consults any rule akin to Get the Queen out\nearly. For that reason, we should not expect that the machine\nexplicitly represents this rule even if the rule is in some sense\nbuilt into the machine\u2019s programming. Similarly, typical\nthinkers do not consult inference rules when engaging in deductive\ninference. So RTT does not demand that a typical thinker explicitly\nrepresent inference rules, even if she conforms to them and in some\nsense tacitly believes that she should conform to them.\n",
