    "main_text": "Mohist Ethics || A consequentialist ethic, but what kind?\n3.1 A consequentialist ethic, but what kind?\n\nThe Mohists constituted a philosophical school founded by Mozi, who\nwas roughly contemporaneous with Confucius. Not much is known about\nhim, but a reasonable speculation is that Mozi came from an artisan\nbackground. The text bearing his name contains purported quotations\nfrom Mozi, but it is manifestly the contribution of different persons\nover a substantial period of time. The text advocates a\nconsequentialist ethic that requires concern and acting for the\nbenefit of all. Those who made the earliest contributions to\nthe Mozi had a conception of benefit that is very\nconcrete and relatively narrow, limited to material goods to\nsatisfy the basic needs of all (e.g., enough food, shelter and warm\nclothing), sufficient population, and social order. As will be\ndiscussed later, however, this earliest conception may have included\nrelational virtues such as filiality. Later Mohists seem to have\nbroadened their conception to something like a a preference\nsatisfaction criterion using pleasure and displeasure as indicators\n(See Stephens\u2019 2021 argument for such an interpretation of the\nlater Mohists; for a translation, see Fraser 2020: Books 40\u20133 A\n26\u201327).\n\nThe Mozi is quite explicit in its consequentialism. It names\nthree fa or standards for judging the viability of beliefs\nand theories (see Fraser 2020, Book 35). One standard is of\nusefulness. In applying this standard, one assesses the viability of a\nbelief or theory according to the beneficial or harmful consequences\nof acting on it. Another standard is that of consulting the origin,\nwhich is the historical record on the actions of the sage-kings. One\ndetermines whether the belief or theory being judged accords with\nthose actions. The third standard is looking at evidence provided by\nthe eyes and ears of the people. This seems to refer to observations\nthat garner some degree of intersubjective consensus. Each standard is\npresented as if its validity might be independent from the others, but\nthere are indications that the standard of usefulness is the most\nbasic one. For one thing, consulting the record of the\nsage-kings\u2019 actions hardly seems to be a good idea in Mohist\nterms given the Mohist objection to valuing tradition for its own\nsake, unless these actions are good guides because they\nproduced good results, a historical judgment that was commonly\naccepted by otherwise disputing philosophical schools. Furthermore,\narguments given in the Mozi that are purportedly based on\nintersubjective observation seem extremely dubious, e.g., that ghosts\nexist because stories are told about them very often. In fact, the\npossibility that ghosts do not exist is explicitly admitted (Fraser\n2020, Book 31), but sacrifices to spirits are justified on the grounds\nthat they produce good effects among the living. Ghosts in general are\nput to good use in the text: their primary activity is to avenge\nthemselves upon the living persons who have done them wrong. The\nstandard of usefulness guides application of the other standards. Even\nwhat seems to be the attempted justification of the standard of\nusefulness by reference to the will of tian or Heaven\n(Fraser, Book 26) has a circularity to it. We are to promote benefits\nand avoid harms because that is the will of Heaven, and Heaven\u2019s\nwill is to be relied upon because it is the wisest and noblest of all\nagents. But what could be the criterion for a being\u2019s being wise\nand noble exception the promotion of benefits and avoidance of harms?\nFurthermore, the will of Heaven is demonstrated by the fact that\nwrongdoers are punished and the virtuous rewarded. Again, the evidence\nseems highly selective and is guided by the very standard of\nusefulness that it is seeemingly being justified.\n\nA crucial issue in the interpretation of Mohism is what kind of\nconcern for all it requires. As indicated earlier, Mencius interpreted\nthe Mohist advocacy of jian ai to be advocacy of equal or\nimpartial care for all, but some of the more important contemporary\nscholarship of Mohism has problematized this interpretation. Three\nbooks in the Mozi text (Fraser 2020, Books 14, 15, and 16)\nall bear the title of \u201dJian Ai\u201c (translated by\nFraser as \u201dInclusive Care\u201c). These books differ somewhat in\ncontent, perhaps suggesting an evolution in Mohist thought over time\ncorresponding to the order of the chapters (see Defoort, 2005\u20136).\nPeople who do nothing to benefit others if they are not related to\nthem in the right way, or even harm them, are contrasted with those\nwho act according to jian ai. In the later two books, we are\ntold to care for others as we care for ourselves, to view others as we\nview ourselves, or to be for others as we are for ourselves. Such\nformulations might reasonably be taken to require equality or\nimpartiality of care. Perhaps this is why Mencius interpreted Mozi as\nrequiring denial of one\u2019s parents (Mencius 3B9).\n\nHowever, the jian ai books consistently count among the\nfailures to care for others failures of filiality between fathers and\nsons. They correspondingly count among the benefits of acting\naccording to jian ai the realization of relational virtues\nsuch as filiality. Furthermore, the words used to say that we are to\ncare for others \u201das\u201c we care for ourselves, to view others\n\u201das\u201c we view ourselves, and to be for others\n\u201das\u201c we are for ourselves, are ruo and\nyou, which can be used to mean equality of relationship or\nmerely similarity of relationship (see Chiu 2013; Fraser 2016). Chiu\n(2013) concludes that jian ai means only caring for everyone\nwith no requirement in equality of care. Fraser (2016), on the other\nhand, points to passages in later chapters of the Mozi (in\nthe section called the \u201dMo Bian\u201c or \u201dMohist\nDialectics;\u201c see Fraser, 2016: 171) that support the equal or\nimpartial caring interpretation.\n\nFurther complicating the situation is the necessity to distinguish\njian ai as a prescription for the attitude to take toward\nothers and a prescription for conduct toward them. To have equal care\nas an attitude does not entail acting toward others in the same way.\nIndeed, the limited nature of the mental and physical resources\navailable to the individual agent seems to necessitate some degree of\ninequality of action toward others. This may be at least partly why\nthe jian ai books are relatively modest in their\nprescriptions for how individuals are to benefit others, even though\nthere is some expansion of requirement in the later chapters. In fact\neven the latter prescriptions do not seem incompatible with what might\nbe prescribed in the way of conduct by Confucian care with\ndistinctions: refraining from harming others, engaging in\nrelationships of mutual aid, and contributing to the support of those\nleast able to care for themselves and who lack families able to\nprotect them. Thus the Mohists may eventually have come to the view\nthat a division of moral labor is suitable for most people. Most can\nsatisfy the duties of righteousness (yi) through refraining\nfrom harming others, devoting more of their resources to benefiting\nthose in traditional relationships with them such as family, engaging\nin mutual aid in somewhat larger groups such as the village, being\nprepared to contribute along with others to the support and protection\nof the most needy, and being loyal to those charged with seeing to the\nbenefit of much larger groups. This picture fits with Mozi\u2019s\nexpress concern (in book 8 on promoting the worthy) that social\nconflict comes from each person having and acting on their own\nconception of what is right. To avoid conflict a strict nested\nhierarchy of authority must be instituted: the Son of Heaven rules\nover the entire country with the help of ministers, and the country is\ndivided into states, which are further divided into fiefdoms, and so\non. Each social unit has members who are required to report their\nviews to a superior on what is right and wrong, and the superior\u2019s\nword on what is right is final (though one may remonstrate with a\nsuperior if one believes them wrong), and each unit must report to the\nsuperior of the next larger unit containing it. The Son of Heaven is\naccountable to Heaven, Tian, a more clearly and consistently\nanthropomorphized deity than the Confucian Tian, and whose\nwill is that people benefit and not harm one another.\n\nHonoring the relational virtues of family may be justified on the\ngrounds that it is part of a social division of labor that most\nefficiently contributes to the benefit of all. It may also be, as\nFraser (2016: 146) has suggested, that the Mohist conception of\nbenefit (li) includes the realization of such virtues as\ngoods in themselves. On either construal or both, since the possible\njustifications are not inconsistent with another, Mohists may not have\nadvocated as demanding an ethic as may appear from the text\u2019s\nstatements of what jian ai is. Even if one interprets the\nattitudinal component as requiring equal or impartial care, the\nconduct component might consist of only a moderately demanding norms\nfor benefiting others.\n\nHeaven is treated as a kind of model for human beings. In one of the\nbooks on Heaven\u2019s will, Mozi is quoted as saying that he treats\nthe will of Heaven as a wheelwright holds to his compass and a\ncarpenter his square. That Heaven is taken as a direct model in this\nway is significant for the question of whether jian ai taken\nin its attitudinal component means equal concern or merely concern\nthat can vary in degree. Heaven\u2019s will is not known through\nrevelation or scripture but rather in how it acts. According to the\ntext, it benefits and nourishes everyone; it rewards those who aid\nothers and punishes those who harm others. It provides life and\nsustenance to rich and poor, noble and low, kin and nonkin; it created\nthe regular and constant pattern of the seasons and weather that makes\nall these broadly distributed benefits possible. If Heaven\u2019s\nwill is taken as a model for the attitude one should have toward\nothers, then impartiality of attitude seems to be the\nprescription.\n\nHeaven also can serve as a model for conduct, such that one might not\nonly benefit all in the sense of conforming to norms that would\ngenerally benefit everyone if enough people do their part, but also\ndirectly try to benefit as many people as possible, especially if one\nis in a position of means and influence. In the 16th book, King Wen is\nextolled as having exemplified the practice of jian ai. His\npractice was like the illumination of the sun and the moon, showing no\nfavoritism to any direction or region. King Wen here exemplifies what\ncan be a more demanding virtue than righteousness, which is\nbenevolence (in the Mohist text this probably the best translation of\nren). Fraser points out that in some of the later books of\nthe Mozi that feature dialogues between Mozi and others, an\nideal of sagehood emerges that is much more demanding than the\nprescriptions issued for everyone in the jian ai books. In\nchapter 49, righteousness is characterized as lying largely in helping\nothers (Fraser 2016: 150). More radically, book 47 quotes Mozi as\nadvocating the elimination of happiness, anger, joy, sorrow, likes and\ndislikes and dedicating oneself solely to benevolence and\nrighteousness. Thus there might have been an evolution towards this\nmore demanding ideal late in the Mohist movement, but perhaps, as\nFraser (2016: 151) suggests, this ideal was treated as applicable only\nto the most devoted of Mohists.\n\nThis greater complexity associated with what it means to care for all\nmight be a feature of any consequentialist ethic that takes seriously\nthe idea of equal or impartial concern. Even if care as an attitude\ndoes not necessarily require trying to directly promote the benefit of\nall, the more capacity one has to promote the welfare of large numbers\nof people, the more one may (or should) feel bound to do so. Even if\none acknowledges relationships such as those one finds in good\nfamilies to have value in themselves, one might also be moved by the\nrecognition that these things are valuable to everyone. One might come\nto feel bound by the acknowledgment that one would be doing the most\ngood by helping the greater number to fulfill their basic needs and to\nachieve those relationships, even if this drains the mental and\nphysical resources one has to put into one\u2019s own\nrelationships.\n\nIt is perhaps no accident that similar ambiguities are displayed in\nWestern forms of consequentialism. There are very demanding forms of\nconsequentialism, exemplified by Peter Singer\u2019s argument for\nstrong duties to contribute to famine relief (Singer, 1972). These\nforms typically focus on the good an individual could do on their own,\nregardless of whether others act similarly. When combined with the\nidea that others are no less morally important than oneself, these\nforms tend to justify very strong duties on the part of those with\nrelatively plentiful resources to aid others. On the other hand, there\nare forms of consequentialism that construe the individual\u2019s\nduties in terms of a generally applicable set of norms, the\ndesirability of which is determined by the consequences of everyone or\nnearly everyone accepting them. Such forms of consequentialism, (e.g.,\nfor rule consequentialism, see Hooker 2000), tend to confirm more\nmodest demands on the individual to aid others. Consequentialism may\ntend to oscillate between the pole of doing\u2019s best in directly\nacting on equal concern for all others on the one hand and on the\nother hand acknowledging both practical and psychological limitations\non the ability of (at least) most people to do so.\n",
