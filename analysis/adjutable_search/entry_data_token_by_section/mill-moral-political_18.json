    "main_text": "Mill\u2019s Liberalism || The Harm Principle\n3.6 The Harm Principle\n\nWith a better understanding of the rationale and limits of\nMill\u2019s liberal principles, we can take a closer look at the\ndetails of his categorical approach, including its\ncenterpiece\u2014the harm principle.\n\nFirst, recall that Mill distinguishes between harm and\nmere offense. Not every unwelcome consequence for others\ncounts as a harm. Offenses tend to be comparatively minor and\nephemeral. To constitute a harm, an action must be injurious or set\nback important interests of particular people, interests in which they\nhave rights (I 12; III 1; IV 3, 10, 12; V 5). Whereas Mill appears to\nreject the regulation of mere offense, the harm principle appears to\nbe the one justification he recognizes for restricting liberty.\n\nSecond, Mill envisions that the harm principle is something that we\ncan apply prospectively to prevent someone from acting in certain ways\nand causing harm. In many cases all we could reasonably know is that a\ngiven action risks harm. Fortunately, this seems to be all\nthat Mill requires (IV 10). There are interesting and important\nquestions about what threshold of risk must be met for purposes of the\nharm principle, which Mill does not address. Presumably, the threshold\nshould vary inversely with the magnitude of the harm risked, so that\nthe probability of harm required to justify regulation is lower the\ngreater the harm risked.\n\nThird, Mill wants the harm principle to have wide scope. He\ninsists that the harm principle regulates more than relations between\ngovernment and individuals. Its application should include the family,\nin particular, relationships between husbands and wives and parents\nand children (V 12). Here, he prefigures some claims he will develop\nin The Subjection of Women (discussed below).\n\nFourth, though Mill often focuses simply on harm, it appears that his\nreal focus is on non-consensual harm (I 2; see Saunders\n2016). He endorses the maxim volenti non fit injuria, which\nhe glosses in Utilitarianism as the doctrine that \u201cthat\nis not unjust which is done with the consent of the person who is\nsupposed to be hurt by it\u201d (U V 28). It is not that one\ncannot be hurt by something one has consented to or freely risked.\nRather, when one has knowingly and willing risked something harmful,\none cannot legitimately complain when that harm comes home to roost.\nHaving my nose broken surely counts as a harm, but if you broke my\nnose in a boxing match, I cannot fairly complain about the harm,\nbecause I consented to the risk.\n\nDoes Mill really treat the harm principle as the sole legitimate basis\nfor restricting the liberties of individuals? As we have seen, Mill\ncannot think that harm prevention is sufficient to justify restricting\nliberty.\n\n\nAs soon as any part of a person\u2019s conduct affects prejudicially\nthe interests of others, society has jurisdiction over it, and the\nquestion whether the general welfare will or will not be promoted by\ninterfering with it, becomes open to discussion. (OL IV\n3)\n\n\nLater, Mill makes clear that harm prevention is necessary but not\nsufficient to justify restrictions on liberty.\n\n\n[I]t must by no means be supposed, because damage, or probability of\ndamage, to the interests of others, can alone justify the interference\nof society, that therefore it always does justify such interference.\n(V 3)\n\n\nThese claims demonstrate that Mill is not committed to a simple\nversion of the sufficiency of harm for restrictions on liberty.\nHowever, these claims are compatible with Mill endorsing a weaker\nversion of sufficiency.\n\n\nIf anyone does an act hurtful to others, there is a prima\nfacie case for punishing him by law or, where legal penalties are\nnot safely applicable, by general disapprobation. (I 11)\n\n\nThis suggests that Mill\u2019s position is that causing harm is\nalways pro tanto reason\u2014a non-negligible\nreason\u2014to regulate the action, but nonetheless a reason that\nmight be outweighed by countervailing reasons not to regulate. If the\nregulation is more harmful than the behavior in question, it may be\nbest not to regulate, despite the pro tanto case for\nregulation. This suggests that we should distinguish stronger and\nweaker versions of the idea that harm is sufficient to justify\nregulation.\n\nWeak Sufficiency: Harm to others is a pro tanto\njustification of regulation.\nStrong Sufficiency: Harm to others is a\nconclusive justification of regulation.\n\n\nOnce we distinguish these options, there is a pretty compelling case\nfor thinking that Mill rejects strong sufficiency but embraces weak\nsufficiency.\n\nBut notice that if Mill rejects strong sufficiency then this\ncompromises his one very simple principle. For only strong sufficiency\nshows that the harm principle is a complete guide to the regulation of\nliberty, telling us both when regulation is impermissible and when it\nis required. Even weak sufficiency implies that the harm principle\nmust be supplemented with some other principle, such as the\nutilitarian principle, in order to determine if regulation is\npermissible, much less required. Mill\u2019s doubts about strong\nsufficiency imply that his own conception of liberal rights requires\nmore than the harm principle.\n\nIn rejecting strong sufficiency, Mill claims that actions that cause\nlosses in a fair competition should not be regulated (V 3\u20134).\nThis case would fall within his \u201cfree-trade\u201d exception,\nwhich limits the scope of the liberty principle (V 4). Unfortunately,\nMill is not entirely clear about the basis for the free-trade\nexception. After all, losses, even in a fair competition, can be\nharmful. If I have a successful business selling widgets and then you\nmove into the area selling widgets at a big discount and drive me out\nof business, forcing me into bankruptcy, I suffer a significant loss,\nmaking me worse off than I would otherwise have been.\n\nIf Mill accepts weak, rather than strong, sufficiency, then he might\nclaim that though there is a reason to regulate harmful economic\ncompetition the costs of interfering with free markets are too great.\nHowever, this seems not be Mill\u2019s preferred response. His\nofficial position seems to be that the harm principle should not be\napplied to such economic harms (IV 4). It is hard to see why Mill\nembraces this sort of free-trade exception. A different and better\nreply would not suspend the operation of the harm principle in such\ncases but rather claim that such losses should not be understood as\nharms, in the relevant sense. Mill might make either of two related\narguments for not treating such losses as harms. First, he might\ninvoke the volenti principle and insist that the harm\nprinciple targets only non-consensual harms. He could then argue that\nin a market economy that ensures fair terms of cooperation economic\nlosses of the sort described are freely risked and so consensual, in\nthe relevant sense. Second, Mill can and does claim that competitive\nlosses are not harms, because they do not deprive economic actors of\nsomething to which they have a right (OL V 3). Recall that\nMill says that a harm involves damage to an interest to which a person\nhas a right (I 12; III 1; IV 3, 10, 12; V 5). You may beat me out in a\nfair competition for a job. But I don\u2019t seem to have a right to\nthe job. Instead, what I have is a right of fair opportunity to\ncompete for the job.\n\nIs harm necessary to justify regulation? Though some of Mill\u2019s\npronouncements suggest that causing harm is a necessary condition of\nrestricting liberty, closer inspection suggests that Mill countenances\nvarious restrictions on individual liberty that appear designed to\nbenefit others, rather than prevent harm. Let\u2019s focus on two\nmain kinds of apparent exceptions to the necessity thesis: (1)\nenforceable duties to others that benefit them, such as the duty to\ngive evidence in court and Good Samaritan duties (I 11) and (2)\nenforceable duties to contribute one\u2019s fair share to the\nprovision of various kinds of public goods (IV 3), including the\ncommon defense (OL I 11; PPE V.viii.1), community\ninfrastructure (PPE V.viii.1; CRG 538, 541),\nmandatory education (OL V 12\u201314; PPE\nII.xiii.3, V.xi.8; CRG 467\u201370), and state support for\nthe arts (PPE V.xi.15). These two sorts of exception present\nsomewhat different issues.\n\nIn discussing enforceable duties to give evidence or Samaritan aid,\nMill claims that the failure to confer benefits constitutes harm. But\nit is not in general true that the failure to provide benefits always\ncounts as a harm. In many cases it seems not to. You would benefit me\nby transferring all your savings to my bank account (let us assume);\nit doesn\u2019t follow that your failure to do so harms me. Why not?\nPresumably, because we assess harms counterfactually: if x\nharms me, it makes me significantly worse off than I would have been\notherwise. This makes clear that harms are assessed relative to some\nbaseline. It is an interesting question how to set the baseline. But\nthe baseline cannot be set by the restriction on liberty itself; that\nwould convert all failures to benefit into harms. The baseline must\nhave some independent rationale. Consider Mill\u2019s example of Good\nSamaritan laws. A classic example of the sort of Samaritan duty that\nMill favors would be the requirement to save a drowning child when I\ncould do so at little cost or risk to myself. It is not clear that my\nfailure to rescue harms the child. Have I made the child worse-off\nthan he would otherwise have been? Well, relative to what baseline? Of\ncourse, I have made him worse-off relative to the baseline situation\nin which Good Samaritanism is compulsory. But why select that\nbaseline? I haven\u2019t made him worse-off relative to the situation\nhe would have been in had I not been there. By hypothesis, he would\nhave drowned in my absence. If so, it is not clear that I harm the\nperson whom I fail to rescue. This is not to deny that my failure to\nrescue is wrong and perhaps that the law ought to compel aid in such\ncases. But it does raise questions about whether we can justify Good\nSamaritan laws by appeal to the harm principle.\n\nNotice that even if my failure to rescue the child does not harm him,\nhe is nonetheless harmed by drowning. After all, he would have been\nbetter off had he not fallen into the pond and drowned. This suggests\na possible way for Mill to square Good Samaritan laws with the harm\nprinciple. Even if restrictions on A\u2019s freedom,\nrequiring him to benefit B, cannot be justified on grounds of\npreventing A from harming B, they may nonetheless be\njustified on the grounds of preventing harm to B. This draws\nour attention to a significant ambiguity in the harm principle (see\nLyons 1979). Mill talks both about preventing one from harming others\nand about harm prevention. Indeed, his statement of the one very\nsimple principle mentions both (OL I 9). But as the Samaritan\nexample brings out, these two claims are not equivalent. Every time I\nprevent one person from harming another, I also engage in harm\nprevention. But some cases of preventing harm may not be cases of\npreventing one person from harming another. So we really should\ndistinguish two different versions of the harm principle.\n\nHP1 is an anti-harming principle: A can restrict\nB\u2019s liberty only in order to prevent B from harming\nothers.\nHP2 is a harm-prevention principle: A can\nrestrict B\u2019s liberty only in order to prevent harm\nto others.\n\n\nBecause every case of preventing one person from harming another is a\ncase of harm prevention, but not vice versa, HP1 is narrower than HP2.\nIndeed, HP1 is a proper part of HP2. Whereas HP1 justifies\nintervention only when the target herself would be the cause of harm\nto others, HP2 would justify intervention to prevent harm to others,\nwhether that harm would be caused by the target or in some other way.\nClearly, HP2 will justify more intervention than HP1. As we have seen,\nit is hard to justify Good Samaritan laws if HP is the sole basis for\nrestricting liberty as long as we understand HP as HP1. The fact that\nMill thinks Samaritan laws can be squared with the harm principle (I\n11) is evidence that he understands the harm principle in terms of\nharm prevention.\n\nA different worry about the necessity of harm concerns those cases\ninvolving restrictions on liberty in the compulsory provision of\npublic goods. For it is part of the structure of public goods that the\neffect of individual contributions on provision of the public good is\nnegligible. The negative impact of an individual\u2019s failure to\ncontribute is both small and is spread widely over the population. But\nthat means that even if failure to provide public goods would\notherwise count as a serious loss for all and a harm, the cost of\nindividual failures to provide for such goods does not seem to meet\nMill\u2019s criteria for harmful conduct\u2014the impact of\nindividual failures to contribute to public goods is too small and\nspread too widely to constitute the breach of \u201ca distinct and\nassignable obligation to any other person or persons\u201d (IV 10).\nInsofar as this is a worry for the harm principle, it seems to be\nequally a worry for HP1 and for HP2.\n\nOne Millian response is to deny that the harm principle is intended to\nserve as a necessary condition on any and all restrictions on liberty.\nAs we saw, Mill is interested in defending fundamental or\nbasic liberties, rather than liberty per se. In\nparticular, he is interested in liberties of conscience and expressive\nliberties, liberties of tastes and pursuits, and liberties of\nassociation (I 12). He can defend these liberties as playing a more\ncentral role in our practical deliberations and our formation and\npursuit of personal ideals than other liberties. But then Mill might\ntry to justify the modest restrictions on liberty necessary to provide\nthe benefits of significant public goods by claiming that, even if\nthese restrictions on liberty don\u2019t prevent harms, they do not\nrestrict fundamental liberties and they do help secure other goods,\nsuch as education, security, and sanitation, that serve as necessary\nconditions of our happiness.\n\nThis issue requires us to distinguish two more readings of the harm\nprinciple: one in terms of liberty per se and one in terms of\nbasic liberties. This distinction cuts across the distinction between\nanti-harming and harm prevention, giving us four possible\ninterpretations of the necessity claim.\n\nHP1A: A can restrict B\u2019s liberty\nonly in order to prevent B from harming others.\nHP1B: A can restrict B\u2019s basic\nliberties only in order to prevent B from harming\nothers.\nHP2A: A can restrict B\u2019s liberty\nonly in order to prevent harm to others.\nHP2B: A can restrict B\u2019s basic\nliberties only in order to prevent harm to others.\n\n\nEarlier, we suggested that the harm principle would be more robust and\nbetter fit with Mill\u2019s views about justified restrictions of\nliberty if we understood it is a harm prevention principle,\nessentially, as HP2A, rather than HP1A. Now we have seen how the harm\nprinciple would be more robust and better fit Mill\u2019s views about\njustified restrictions of liberty if we understood it to regulate\nrestrictions on basic liberties, rather than liberty per se.\nThis requires us to interpret the harm principle as HP2B. We might\ncall this the basic liberties harm prevention principle. But\nif we interpret the harm principle this way, then Mill is even further\nfrom a libertarian view, at least if libertarianism is understood as\nthe idea that the only legitimate limit on individual liberty is to\nprevent that individual from acting in ways that harm others.\n\nThe necessity claim that the harm principle makes is more robust if we\ninterpret it as the basic liberties harm prevention principle. But,\neven so interpreted, the necessity claim is still false. For all\nversions of the harm principle insist that paternalism is an\nimpermissible rationale for restriction. But Mill does not in fact\naccept a blanket prohibition on paternalism. He allows paternalistic\nrestrictions on selling oneself into slavery (V 11). In a moment, we\nwill discuss the justification and scope of this exception to the\nnormal prohibition on paternalism. But the exception itself shows that\nMill does not think that the only acceptable restrictions on liberty\nare those that prevent harm to others. For this is a case in which it\nis permissible to restrict liberty, not to prevent harm to others, but\nto prevent a special kind of harm to self.\n\nIf harm prevention is neither necessary nor sufficient for justifying\nrestrictions on liberty, then Mill\u2019s \u201cone very simple\nprinciple\u201d is over-simple.\n",
