    "main_text": "Moral Phenomenology and Normative Ethics || Deontology vs. consequentialism\n3.1 Deontology vs. consequentialism\n\nJohn Rawls describes normative ethical theory as\n\n\nthe study of substantive moral conceptions, that is, the study of how\nthe basic moral notions of the right, the good, and moral worth may be\narranged to form different moral structures. (1975: 286)\n\n\nEach of these basic notions corresponds to a branch of any complete\nethical theory: theory of right conduct (or obligation), theory of\nvalue, and theory of moral worth (or virtue). A common way to\ndistinguish different ethical theories by their structure is in terms\nof which of these three notions (and corresponding theories) is most\nbasic in relation to a theory of right conduct. Consequentialist\ntheories explain right conduct in terms of the value of consequences\nassociated with an action or with rules for action guidance; they\nrepresent value-based theories (see the entry on\n consequentialism).\n Deontological theories are united in rejecting consequentialism and,\nfor instance, appealing to respect for persons as a basis for\nexplaining right conduct (see the entry on\n deontology).\n Virtue ethical theories take considerations of virtue (e.g., the\nactivities of a virtuous agent) as a basis for explaining right\nconduct (see the entry on\n virtue ethics).\n Because virtue ethical theories of obligation have emerged relatively\nrecently, twentieth century debates in ethical theory were dominated\nby debates between consequentialists (sometimes referred to as\nteleological theories) and deontologists. How might phenomenological\ninquiry be brought to bear on the dispute between these two types of\ntheory?\n\nWe have already touched on such debates in the previous section\n(Brentano\u2019s teleological ideal utilitarianism opposed by\nLevinas\u2019s non-teleological ethics). Mandelbaum defended a type\nof deontological view, so-called perceptual intuitionism, according to\nwhich in both direct and removed moral judgments of obligation, the\nfocus of one\u2019s judgment is on the fittingness (or unfittingness)\nof the act in relation to the agent\u2019s circumstances, a relation\nthat one directly apprehends\u2014a kind of intellectual perception.\nAlthough perceptual intuitionism is a kind of deontological theory, in\narguing for this view on phenomenological grounds Mandelbaum attempted\nto \u201cresolve \u2026 the conflict between utilitarianism and\ndeontology\u201d (1955: 71). So, for instance, regarding direct moral\njudgments of obligation focused on promoting good consequences,\nMandelbaum argues that as with felt obligations to keep a promise, or\nexpress gratitude, whose grounds lie in one\u2019s past, a felt\nobligation to bring about some good state of affairs rests upon\none\u2019s apprehension that an action one can perform is felt to be\na fitting response to the envisioned state of affairs in question,\nindeed, that refraining from the action would be unfitting. He thus\nconcludes that there is no genuine phenomenological difference between\nfinding the ground of obligation in the envisioned end of action (its\nconsequences) and finding the ground of this same obligation in the\nfittingness of the action to one\u2019s situation. In this way, he\nclaims, one can reconcile the phenomenology associated with\nteleologically focused judgments of direct obligation with the\nphenomenology of direct judgments of obligation whose experienced\nground is the fittingness of the action to one\u2019s situation. What\nMandelbaum attempts to thereby show is that the phenomenology of\njudgments of obligation (both direct and removed) have a common\nphenomenological character properly captured in his favored perceptual\nintuitionism\u2014a form of deontology\u2014and thus on\nphenomenological grounds his form of deontology is to be preferred\nover versions of\n teleology.[22]\n\nThis is but one example of bringing phenomenological considerations to\nbear on ethical theory. We have dwelt on Mandelbaum because of the\ndepth and subtlety of his phenomenological analysis which he brings to\nbear on the issue of structure. However, increasingly, philosophers in\nthe analytic tradition have been more attentive to the relevance of\nphenomenological considerations in defending ethical theories. For\ninstance, T. M. Scanlon defends a \u201ccontractualist\u201d ethical\ntheory that he finds attractive partly because, \u201cthe account it\noffers of moral motivation is phenomenologically more accurate than\nany other I know of\u201d (1998: 187). Specifically, Scanlon argues\nthat his contractualism fits with one\u2019s experience of the\npriority and significance of moral reasons for action (compared to\nnonmoral reasons for action) and does so in a way superior to\ncompeting ethical theories.\n",
