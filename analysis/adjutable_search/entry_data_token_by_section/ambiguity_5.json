When you say \u2018I am parked on G\nSt.\u2019, you presumably manage to refer to the car rather than\nyourself. Similarly, \u2018I am traditionally allowed a final\nsupper\u2019 said by a prisoner is not about himself (there are no\ntraditions regarding him). The mechanics of reference transfer are\nmysterious, and the interaction of transferred terms with the syntax\nis a matter of some dispute.\n\nOf course, sentences can have many of these properties at once.\n\u2018My uncle wonders if I am parked where the bank begins\u2019 is\nsense-general, ambiguous, context-sensitive, vague and it involves\nreference-transfer. Nonetheless, it is important to keep these\nproperties apart as the semantic treatment we give each may vary\nwildly, the ways of testing for them may require highly specialized\nconsiderations and their source may well differ radically from\nphenomenon to phenomenon.\n",
