    "main_text": "Properties: Basic Ideas || Universals versus Tropes\n1.6 Universals versus Tropes\n\nAccording to some philosophers, universals and tropes may coexist in\none ontological framework (see, e.g., Lowe 2006 for a well-known\ngeneral system of this kind, and Orilia 2006a, for a proposal based on\nempirical data from quantum mechanics). However, nowadays they are\ntypically seen as alternatives, with the typical supporter of\nuniversals (\u201cuniversalist\u201d) trying to do without tropes\n(e.g., Armstrong 1997) and the typical supporter of tropes\n(\u201ctropist\u201d) trying to dispense with universals (e.g.,\nMaurin\n 2002).[5]\n In order to clarify how differently they see matters, we may take\nadvantage of states of affairs. Both parties may agree, say, that\nthere are two red apples, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). They will immediately\ndisagree, however, for the universalist will add that\n\nthere are two distinct states of affairs, that a is red\nand that b is red,\nsuch states are similar in having the universal red as\nconstituent, and\nthey differ insofar as the former has \\(a\\) as constituent,\nwhereas the latter has \\(b\\).\n\n\nThe tropist will reject these states of affairs with universals as\nconstituents and rather urge that there are two distinct tropes, the\nredness of \\(a\\) and the redness of \\(b\\), which play a theoretical\nrole analogous to the one that the universalist would invoke for such\nstates of affairs. Hence, tropists claim that tropes can be causal\nrelata (D. Williams 1953) and truthmakers (Mulligan, Simons, &\nSmith 1984).\n\nTropes are typically taken to be simple, i.e., without any\nsubconstituent (see Section 2.2 of the entry on\n tropes).\n Their playing the role of states of affairs with universals as\nconstituents depends on this: universals combine two functions, only\none of which is fulfilled by tropes. On the one hand, universals are\ncharacterizers, inasmuch as they characterize concrete\nobjects. On the other hand, they are also unifiers, to the\nextent that different concrete objects may be characterized by the\nvery same universal, which is thus somehow shared by all of them; when\nthis is the case, there is, according to the universalist, an\nobjective similarity among the different objects (see\n \u00a71.2).\n In contrast, tropes are only characterizers, for, at least as\ntypically understood, they cannot be shared by distinct concrete\nobjects. Given its dependency on one specific object, say, the apple\n\\(a\\), a trope can do the work of a state of affairs with \\(a\\) as\nconstituent. But for tropes to play this role, the tropist will have\nto pay a price and introduce additional theoretical machinery to\naccount for objective similarities among concrete objects. To this\nend, she will typically resort to the idea that there are objective\nresemblances among tropes, which can then be grouped together in\nresemblance classes. These resemblance classes play the role of\nunifiers for the tropist. Hence, from the tropist\u2019s point of\nview \u201cproperty\u201d is ambiguous, since it may stand for the\ncharacterizers (tropes) or for the unifiers (resemblance classes) (cf.\nentry on\n mental causation, \u00a76.5).\n Similarly, \u201cexemplification\u201d and related words may be\nregarded as ambiguous insofar as they can be used either to indicate\nthat an object exemplifies a certain trope or to indicate that the\nobject relates to a certain resemblance class by virtue of\nexemplifying a trope in that\n class.[6]\n",
