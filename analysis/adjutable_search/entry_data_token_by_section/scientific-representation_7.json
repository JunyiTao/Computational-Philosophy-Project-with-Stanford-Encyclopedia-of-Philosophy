    "main_text": "The Structuralist Conception || Structuralism and the ER-Problem\n4.2 Structuralism and the ER-Problem\n\nThe most basic structuralist conception of scientific representation\nasserts that scientific models, understood as structures, represent\ntheir target systems in virtue of being isomorphic to them. An\nisomorphism between two structures \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) and\n\\(\\mathcal{S}'\\) is a bijective function from \\(U\\) to \\(U'\\) that\npreserves the relations on \\(U\\) (and inversely, the relations on\n\\(U'\\)). An isomorphism associates each object in \\(U\\) with an object\nin \\(U'\\) and pairs up each relation in \\(R\\) with a relation in\n\\(R'\\) so that a relation holds between certain objects in \\(U\\) iff\nthe corresponding relation holds between the objects in \\(U'\\) that\nare associated with\n them.[9]\n Assume now that the target system \\(T\\) exhibits the structure\n\\(\\mathcal{S}_T\\) and the model is the structure \\(\\mathcal{S}_M\\).\nThen the model represents the target iff it is isomorphic to the\ntarget:\n\nStructuralism 1: A scientific model \\(M\\) represents its\ntarget \\(T\\) iff \\(\\mathcal{S}_T\\) is isomorphic to\n\\(\\mathcal{S}_M\\).\n\nIt bears noting that few adherents of the structuralist account of\nscientific representation, most closely associated with the semantic\nview of theories, explicitly defend this position (although see Ubbink\n1960: 302). Representation was not the focus of attention in the\nsemantic view, and the attribution of (something like)\nStructuralism 1 to its supporters is an extrapolation.\nRepresentation became a much-debated topic in the first decade of the\n21st century, and many proponents of the semantic view then\neither moved away from Structuralism 1, or pointed out that\nthey never held such a view. We turn to more advanced positions\nshortly, but to understand what motivates such positions it is helpful\nto understand why Structuralism 1 fails.\n\nThe first and most obvious problem is the same as with the similarity\nview: isomorphism is symmetrical and reflexive (and transitive) but\nrepresentation isn\u2019t. This problem could be addressed by\nreplacing isomorphism with an alternative mapping. Bartels (2006),\nLloyd (1984), and Mundy (1986) suggest homomorphism; van Fraassen\n(1980, 1997, 2008) and Redhead (2001) isomorphic embeddings; advocates\nof the partial structures approach prefer partial isomophisms (Bueno\n1997; Bueno and French 2011; Da Costa and French 1990, 2003; French\n2003, 2014; French and Ladyman 1999); and Swoyer (1991) introduces\nwhat he calls \\(\\Delta/\\Psi\\) morphisms. We refer to these\ncollectively as \u201cmorphisms\u201d. Pero and Su\u00e1rez (2016)\nprovide a comparative discussion of different morphisms.\n\nThese suggestions solve some, but not all problems. While many of\nthese mappings are not symmetrical, they are all still reflexive. But\neven if these formal issues could be resolved in one way or another, a\nview based on structural mappings would still face other serious\nproblems. For ease of presentation we discuss these problems in the\ncontext of the isomorphism view; mutatis mutandis other\nformal mappings suffer from the same difficulties. Like similarity,\nisomorphism is too inclusive: not all things that are isomorphic\nrepresent each other. In the case of similarity this case was brought\nhome by Putnam\u2019s thought experiment with the ant crawling on the\nbeach; in the case of isomorphism a look at the history of science\nwill do the job. Many mathematical structures were discovered and\ndiscussed long before they were used in science. Non-Euclidean\ngeometries were studied by mathematicians long before Einstein used\nthem in the context of spacetime theories, and Hilbert spaces were\nstudied by mathematicians prior to their use in quantum theory. If\nrepresentation was nothing over and above isomorphism, then we would\nhave to conclude that Riemann discovered general relativity or that\nthat Hilbert invented quantum mechanics. This does not seem correct,\nso it doesn\u2019t seem like isomorphism on its own establishes\nscientific representation (Frigg 2002: 10).\n\nIsomorphism is more restrictive than similarity: not everything is\nisomorphic to everything else. But isomorphism is still too abundant\nto correctly identify what a model represents. The root of the\ndifficulties is that the same structures can be instantiated in\ndifferent kinds of target systems. Certain geometrical structures are\ninstantiated by many different systems; just think about how many\nspherical things we find in the world. The \\(1/r^2\\) law of Newtonian\ngravity is also the \u201cmathematical skeleton\u201d of\nCoulomb\u2019s law of electrostatic attraction and the weakening of\nsound or light as a function of the distance to the source. The\nmathematical structure of the pendulum is also the structure of an\nelectric circuit with a condenser and a solenoid (Kroes 1989). The\nsame structure can be exhibited by more than one kind of target\nsystem, and so isomorphism by itself is too weak to identify a\nmodel\u2019s target.\n\nAs we have seen in the last section, a misrepresentation is one that\nportrays its target as having features it doesn\u2019t have. In the\ncase of a structural account of representation, this means that the\nmodel portrays the target as having structural properties that it\ndoesn\u2019t have. However, isomorphism demands identity of\nstructure: the structural properties of the model and the target must\ncorrespond to one another exactly. So a misrepresentation won\u2019t\nbe isomorphic to the target. By the lights of Structuralism 1\nit therefore is not a representation at all. Like simple similarity\naccounts, Structuralism 1 conflates misrepresentation with\nnon-representation (Su\u00e1rez 2003: 234\u2013235). Partial\nstructures can avoid a mismatch due to a target relation being omitted\nin the model and hence go some way to shoring up the structuralist\naccount (Bueno and French 2011: 888). It remains unclear, however, how\nthey account for distortive representations (Pincock 2005).\n\nFinally, like similarity accounts, Structuralism 1 has a\nproblem with non-existent targets because no model can be isomorphic\nto something that doesn\u2019t exist. If there is no ether, a model\ncan\u2019t be isomorphic to it. Hence models without target cannot\nrepresent what they seem to represent.\n\nMost of these problems can be resolved by making moves similar to the\nones that lead to\n Similarity 3:\n introduce agents and hypothetical reasoning into the account of\nrepresentation. Going through the motions one finds:\n\nStructuralism 2: A scientific model \\(M\\) represents a target\nsystem \\(T\\) iff there is an agent \\(A\\) who uses \\(M\\) to represent a\ntarget system \\(T\\) by proposing a theoretical hypothesis \\(H\\)\nspecifying an isomorphism between \\(\\mathcal{S}_M\\) and\n\\(\\mathcal{S}_T\\).\n\nThis is in line with van Fraassen\u2019s views on representation. He\noffers the following as the \u201cHauptstatz\u201d of a theory of\nrepresentation: \u201cThere is no representation except in the\nsense that some things are used, made, or taken, to represent things\nas thus and so\u201d (2008: 23, original emphasis). Likewise,\nBueno submits that \u201crepresentation is an intentional\nact relating two objects\u201d (2010: 94\u201395, original\nemphasis), and Bueno and French point out that using one thing to\nrepresent another thing is not only a function of (partial)\nisomorphism but also depends on \u201cpragmatic\u201d factors\n\u201chaving to do with the use to which we put the relevant\nmodels\u201d (2011: 885).\n\nAs in the shift from\n Similarity 2\n to\n Similarity 3,\n this seems like a successful move, with many (although not all) of\nthe aforementioned concerns being met. But, again, the role of\nisomorphism has shifted. The crucial ingredient is the agent\u2019s\nintention and isomorphism has in fact become either a representational\nstyle or normative criterion for accurate representation. Let us now\nassess how well isomorphism fares as a response to these problems, and\nthe others outlined above.\n",
