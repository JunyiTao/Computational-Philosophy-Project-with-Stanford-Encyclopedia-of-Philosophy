    "main_text": "\n\n\nAccording to Zhang Xichun \u5f35\u932b\u7d14 (1860\u20131933), one\nof the leading reformers of Chinese medicine in the early twentieth\ncentury:\n\nMany recent medical journal reports take the view that [traditional\nChinese] philosophy holds back the progress of medicine, but their\nauthors do not understand the use of philosophy, nor do they understand\nthat philosophy is actually the basis of medicine. (Zhang Xichun\n1918\u20131934, 296).\n\n\nAt first glance, this assertion seems improbable to say the\nleast. This essay addresses some of the connections between\nChinese philosophy and Chinese medicine in both intellectual and social\naspects.\n\n\nThe first section locates medicine among the Chinese sciences and\nintroduces the intellectual shared common ground of Chinese philosophy\nand Chinese medicine, including shared theories of qi,\nyin-yang and \u201cFive Agents\u201d (wuxing) and\ntheir use in analogies between the human body and the state and cosmos,\nincluding the development of a systematic medical theory of the\nbody. Section Two introduces the important medical contributions\nof \u201cnurturing life\u201d (yang sheng) traditions. \nSection Three takes up what has been represented as a long shared\nhistory of Daoism and medicine in the works of three great Daoist\nphysicians. Section Four returns to the views of Zhang Xichun and his\nclaims for an explicit link between Chinese Medicine and Chinese\nPhilosophy.\n",
