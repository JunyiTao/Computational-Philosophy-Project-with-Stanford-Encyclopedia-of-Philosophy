    "main_text": "Western Han (202 BCE\u20139 CE) || Knowledge and Method: The Syncretism of the Huainanzi\n2.3 Knowledge and Method: The Syncretism of the Huainanzi\n\nOne of the major developments of the Han was the formation of what is\ncommonly known as \u201cHan Syncretism\u201d, associated by some\nwith \u201cschools\u201d such as Huang-Lao and texts such as the\nHuainanzi. The development and nature of Huang-Lao are topics\nstill debated by scholars (see Graham 1991; Major 1993: 10; Chen &\nSung 2015). While the syncretic or synthetic tendency, its ascent, and\nits pinnacle was reached during the Han, such thinking actually had\nits origins much earlier in Chinese history. In Warring States texts\nsuch the Guanzi and Lushi Chunqiu, we find the first\ndevelopments of syncretism. It is in the Han that this trend really\ntakes off, and the Huainanzi represents its high-water\nmark.\n\nEarlier forms of syncretism involved the intentional combination of\naspects of different schools and textual traditions, such as\nConfucianism, Daoism, and Legalism. While we see this to some extent\nin texts like the Chunqiu Fanlu, these forms of syncretism\nwere often not explicit. The Huainanzi, on the other hand,\nopenly discusses its synthesis of ideas from across previously\nopposing schools and traditions. In the Huainanzi, we find a\nspecific methodology for and justification of synthesis built from a\nframework using ideas primarily from the Zhuangzi and\nDaodejing, but involving Confucian, Legalist, and even Mohist\nideas as well. Numerous scholars have debated the ultimate purpose of\nthe Huainanzi\u2019s syncretism (see Goldin 1999;\nVankeerberghen 2001). Clearly there is a political aim of the overall\nproject. Liu An (179\u2013122 BCE), the vassal ruler of the territory\nof Huainan, brought together the scholars who constructed the text.\nLiu was concerned with the ideology of empire. His primary aim was the\ndevelopment of a system synthesizing the numerous and diverse peoples,\ncultures, systems, languages, and ways of life throughout the still\nrelatively new Han empire. The ways of governance and social\nideologies of the past, Liu recognized, may have been acceptable in\nthe smaller-scale societies in which they developed. But these\nsocieties were already unified by language, culture, and social norms.\nImposing the norms and ideology of a single people on others simply\nwould not work in a territory as large and diverse as that controlled\nby the Han. What was needed was a political, ethical, and metaphysical\nsystem that unified the variety of peoples in a single social project\nwhile at the same time allowing for the independence and individuality\nof their local approaches. What resulted from this reflection by the\ncommittee of scholars at Liu An\u2019s court was one of the most\ncomprehensive and powerful syntheses in the history of human thought.\nLiu An\u2019s scholars almost seamlessly combined all of the known\nphilosophical, political, scientific, and religious systems of their\nday into one overarching explanation of the cosmos.\n\nOstensibly the purpose of this, according to Liu An, was to instruct\nhis nephew, Emperor Wu of Han, in the proper ways to maintain the\nempire, unifying the people while allowing for their differences,\nwhich would prove much more effective than attempting to eliminate\nthese differences or impose norms. There was likely another more\npersonal purpose behind the text as well. In the mid to late second\ncentury BCE, the central Han government began moving away from an\nolder model of imperial control in which vassal rulers were given\nindependent control of distant states. These vassal kingdoms were\ngenerally handed out to family or those otherwise demonstratively\nloyal to the Han, such as Liu An, who was the uncle of the Emperor Wu.\nIn the early days of the Han empire, such a political structure was\nnecessary because of the inexperience of the Han court (or any\npolitical entity for that matter) in administering a vast and diverse\nempire. By the time of the Huainanzi\u2019s construction,\nhowever, the Han had developed the experience, organizational\nstructure, and centralized power to more directly administer the\nvarious regions. The central Han government began to take direct\ncontrol of these regions, moving away from the older system of vassal\nrulership. Liu An, as one of these vassal rulers in the dying years of\nthe practice, wanted to secure the practice in order to keep his\nposition and lands. Thus the pluralistic argument of the\nHuainanzi was to a large extent also an argument to Emperor\nWu for why he should leave the vassal kingdoms intact, rather than\nbringing them under the direct control of the Han.\n\nA number of new themes in early Chinese thought are discussed in the\nHuainanzi. The methodology of philosophy is a central concern\nof the text, as discussed in the first two chapters and the final\nchapter in particular. Using a framework that seems to borrow most\nfrom Daoism (Roth 2015: 342), the text aims to create a synthesis of\nnot only other existing intellectual schools, but a variety of other\nmultiplicities. The first two chapters of the text, as well as the\nfinal \u201coverview\u201d chapter offer the main structure for the\nsynthesis of the text, which is explored in specifics in the other\nchapters (Murray 2004). The two main images used are the distinction\nbetween root (ben \u672c) and branches (mo\n\u672b), and the appeal to a unifying \u201cpattern\u201d\n(li \u7406). The Huainanzi argues that the\nunification of all things is explained by the origination of all\nthings in \u201cthe one\u201d (yi \u4e00), which it\nassociated with dao. Things emerge from dao in\nparticular patterns, following yin and yang change.\nWe gain understanding and mastery over ourselves and nature by\nfollowing the myriad things (wan wu \u842c\u7269) as they\ndevelop and change, and their patterns. To do this, we must follow the\nway of tian \u5929 (heaven) rather than that of the human.\nFollowing earlier views of texts such as the Zhuangzi, the\ndistinction drawn between tian and the human (ren\n\u4eba) in the Huainanzi is one of wide vs. narrow focus.\nIt seems to parallel a kind of distinction between the natural and the\nhuman that takes what is associated with the human to be modifying\nnature, with nature as the untouched and separate. The nature/human\ndistinction in the Huainanzi is not total\u2014humanity is\nultimately seen as originating in the same source as the rest of\nnature, somehow operating on the stuff of nature\u2014which later\nchapters (such as ch. 3) understand in terms of the human\n\u201ccompletion\u201d (cheng \u6210) of nature. In\nchapter one, however, a valuation seems to be made, contrasting the\nhuman as the narrow and flawed with the natural as the broad and pure.\nA key passage in Chapter One reads:\n\n\nwhat we call nature is pure and untainted, unadorned and plain, and\nhas never begun to be tainted with impurities. What we call human is\naskew because of wisdom and precedent. It is what looks back to past\ngenerations and interacts with the vulgar. (Huainanzi 1.10,\nMajor, Queen, et al. [trans] 2010: 37)\n\n\nThe human is associated here with desire, intention, artifice, and\nagency, and contrasted with the non-agentive and\n\u201cspontaneous\u201d activity of tian. We have the\nability to act as tian acts by following along with\ntian. This idea is developed in the Zhuangzi and a\nnumber of earlier texts, in which tian and dao are\nsometimes used interchangeably. The Huainanzi, like Daoist\ntexts, locates the problem of human failure, in terms of individual\nthriving, skill and achievement, knowledge, or political organization,\nin the existence of specifically human agency. Like texts\nsuch as the Daodejing and Zhuangzi, the\nHuainanzi presents action in concert with nature\n(tian) and undermining of the specifically human activity\nguided by intention as the keys to ensuring success in all of the\nabove measures. In order to act in this way, however, we must have an\nunderstanding of the patterns of nature, so as to align ourselves with\nthem.\n\nThe Huainanzi has a difficult balancing act to maintain here,\nhowever. While it accepts the Daoist view outlined above concerning\nthe efficacy of following nature and the corrosive nature of\nspecifically human activity, artifice, and tools such as ritual, moral\nnorms, and righteousness (Huainanzi 2.3), it also endorses\nthe Confucian view of the value and necessity of ritual and other such\nhuman inventions. This is partially explained by the account of human\ndevelopment given in Chapter 2. The ancients, according to the text,\nwere able to act in accordance with nature, and thus did not require\nthe artifice of ritual, humanity, and righteousness. In later ages,\nthere was a decline such that ritual and the tools of humanity became\nnecessary. The key to using these artifacts well is to use them\nconsistently with the dao.\n\nThe main argument for synthesis of the Huainanzi is that the\nknowledge to be gained about the world that ultimately allows one to\nattain success can be best attained through understanding what is\ncorrect in all schools and perspectives. The assumption here is that\neach of the competing schools had something right, and was\nproperly responding to some aspect of the world or human life. The\nmistake the various schools made was in their commitment to\npartiality, and the idea that the aspects of the world they\nhad uncovered were the only ones to uncover. When we move beyond this\npartiality, we recognize that each of the myriad schools, teachings,\ncustoms, etc. have some value, if we understand the perspectives from\nwhich they are useful and the aspects of the world they illuminate. A\nkey passage in Chapter Two reads:\n\n\nThe Hundred Schools have different theories, and each has its own\norigins. For example, the relationship of Mozi, Yang Zhu, Shen Buhai,\nand Lord Shang to the Way of Governing is like that of an individual\numbrella rib to the whole canopy and like that of an individual spoke\nto the whole chariot wheel. If you have any one of them, you can\ncomplete the number; if you are missing any one of them, it will not\naffect the utility of the whole. Each one thought that he alone had a\nmonopoly on true governing; he did not understand the genuine\ndisposition of Heaven and Earth. (Huainanzi 2.10, Major,\nQueen, et al. [trans] 2010: 93\u201394 [modified])\n\n\nThe solution the Huainanzi offers to the partiality of the\nmyriad schools is to take the entirety of them, understand how they\nare individually useful, and use them in the right ways. The\nHuainanzi takes this same approach to all areas of human\nknowledge, people, customs, rituals, and things in the world. The sage\naims to understand all of these myriad ways and to thus make\nuse of them, through organizing them in the proper ways. This opens up\na problem, however. How can one possibly understand all\nschools, traditions, peoples, customs, etc? There is far too much\ndiversity and material in the world for any given person to know. The\nHuainanzi\u2019s bold claim is that one can and should\nstrive to attain a summative awareness of all human knowledge. How is\nthis possible?\n\nThe Huainanzi offers a number of ways out of this difficulty,\nbut the most developed one is the use of the distinction between\nroot (ben \u672c) and branch (mo\n\u672b) as applied to areas of knowledge. Each of the various\nschools, areas of human knowledge, and things in the world can be\nconsidered a \u201cbranch\u201d, where the branches are connected to\none another via their grounding in the same \u201croot\u201d. This\nroot can be understood as the pattern (li) of nature\nthat links the branches. The image of the umbrella and rib above shows\nus one example of this, and there are many others in the text. A\npassage in Ch. 2 reads:\n\n\nWhen the myriad things differentiate and branch off, when the hundred\naffairs proliferate and diverge, all have their foundation in a single\nroot, despite their ten million branchings. (Huainanzi 2.11,\nMajor, Queen, et al. [trans] 2010: 94)\n\n\nThe key to understanding (and thus also knowing how to employ) all\nforms of human knowledge is to understand the nature and pattern of\nthe root in which these myriad ways are grounded. The same patterns\nare manifest not only in different areas of human knowledge, subjects,\npeople, customs, languages, etc., but also in the rest of the world.\nOne of the key features of Han syncretic thought and\n\u201ccorrelative cosmology\u201d is the linking of the general\nstructure of humanity and the cosmos (tian), such that the\nvery same patterns govern both. This insight is behind much of what I\nhave called the \u201cnaturalistic shift\u201d of the Han, and the\norigins of much of early Chinese science in the Han period. Some\nexamples of this are the development of the medical tradition, found\nin early texts such as the Huangdi Neijing, and the\nsystematization of astronomy, geography, calendrics, and mathematics.\nThe earliest texts in these areas date to the Han period, and we find\ngeneral discussions of these areas in texts such as Huainanzi\nthat attempt to organize all human knowledge. Thus we have chapters on\nastronomy (Tianwen, ch. 3), calendrics and seasons\n(Shize, ch. 5), and other areas of natural science.\n\nThe application of this understanding of the root, according to the\nLiu An\u2019s scholars, is in managerial acumen. The ruler who\nunderstands the root will also understand the value and role of the\nvariety of different regions, people, customs, languages, disciplines,\nschools, and other things that make up the vast collection of things\nin the empire. Only a ruler with such vast understanding could hope to\nbe successful in maintaining order in an empire as broad and diverse\nas the Han. Thus, the art of learning the root underlying all human\nknowledge is part of the art of rulership, which is the central\nconcern of the Huainanzi. As many noticed, however (and was\nsurely intended), this general framework is applicable beyond the case\nof the ruler. The individual reader can benefit from the\nHuainanzi\u2019s model of learning and understanding, for\ntheir own purposes.\n\nOne interesting feature of the Huainanzi is its position on\nthe role of humanity in completing (cheng \u6210) the\ncosmos, through such activity as measurement (ch.3), naming (ch. 1),\nand construction of customs (ch. 11). The Huainanzi focuses\non the role of the human in both understanding the patterns inherent\nin nature, and also in shaping and completing things on the basis of\nthese patterns. In comparison in particular with accounts of agency\nand free will emerging in philosophical contexts of the post-Abrahamic\nWest, the Huainanzi, and Han philosophy in general, has a far\neasier time squaring human activity and that of the extra-human\nworld.\n\nThe Huainanzi represents the most sophisticated expression of\nthe tendency toward synthesis popular in the early Han period, as well\nas the high-water mark of the trend, before it began to recede in the\nyears after the Han political consolidation of vassal states. Despite\nthis, a strong current of the kind of syncretism found in the\nHuainanzi would continue to thrive in Chinese thought,\nultimately facilitating the construction of the unique kinds of\nBuddhist thought that emerged in China in later centuries, which\nheavily borrowed from both Daoist and Confucian ideas.\n",
