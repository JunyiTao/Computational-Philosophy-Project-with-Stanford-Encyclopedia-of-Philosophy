    "main_text": "Ethics and Political Philosophy\n7. Importance and Influence\n\nArchytas fits the common stereotype of a Pythagorean better than\nanyone else does. He is by far the most accomplished Pythagorean\nmathematician, making important contributions to geometry,\nlogistic/arithmetic and harmonics. He was more successful as a\npolitical leader than any other ancient philosopher, and there is a\nrich anecdotal tradition about his personal self-control. It is\nstriking, however, that there are essentially no testimonia connecting\nArchytas to metempsychosis or the religious aspect of Pythagoreanism.\nArchytas is a prominent figure in the rebirth of interest in\nPythagoreanism in first century BC Rome: Horace, Propertius and Cicero\nall highlight him. As the last prominent member of the early\nPythagorean tradition, more pseudo-Pythagorean works came to be forged\nin his name than any other Pythagorean, including Pythagoras himself.\nHis name, with the spelling Architas, continued to exert power in\nMedieval and Renaissance texts, although the accomplishments assigned\nto him in those texts are fanciful.\n\nScholars have typically emphasized the continuities between Plato and\nArchytas (e.g., Kahn 2001, 56), but the evidence suggests that\nArchytas and Plato were in serious disagreement on a number of issues.\nPlato\u2019s only certain reference to Archytas is part of a\ncriticism of his approach to harmonics in Book VII of the\nRepublic, where there is probably also a criticism of his\nwork in solid geometry. Plato\u2019s attempt to argue for the split\nbetween the intelligible and sensible world in Books VI and VII of the\nRepublic may well be a protreptic directed at Archytas, who\nrefused to separate numbers from things. It is sometimes thought that\nthe eponymous primary speaker in Plato\u2019s Timaeus, who\nis described as a leading political figure and philosopher from\nsouthern Italy (20a), must be a stand-in for Archytas. The\nTimaeus, however, is a most un-Archytan document (Huffman\n2013: 263-8). It is based on the split between the sensible and\nintelligible world, which Archytas did not accept. Plato argues that\nthe universe is limited, while Archytas is famous for this argument to\nshow that it is unlimited. Plato constructs the world soul according\nto ratios that are important in harmonic theory, but he uses\nPhilolaus\u2019 ratios rather than Archytas\u2019. Plato does adopt\nArchytas\u2019 theory of pitch with some modification, but Archytas\nand Plato disagree on the explanation of sight. For a different view\nof the relation between Plato and Archytas see Kingsley 2014:\n156\u20137. Archytas\u2019 refusal to split the intelligible from\nthe sensible may have made him a more attractive figure to Aristotle,\nwho devoted four books to him (Huffman 2005: 583\u2013594) and\npraised his definitions for treating the composite of matter and form,\nnot of form separate from matter (Metaph. 1043a14\u201326).\nArchytas\u2019 vision of the role of mathematics in the state is\ncloser to Aristotle\u2019s mathematical account of distributive and\nredistributive justice (EN 1130b30 ff.) than to Plato\u2019s\nemphasis on the expert mathematical knowledge of the guardians.\nClearly Archytas was an important influence on both Plato and\nAristotle, but the exact nature of those philosophical relationships\nis complex.\n",
