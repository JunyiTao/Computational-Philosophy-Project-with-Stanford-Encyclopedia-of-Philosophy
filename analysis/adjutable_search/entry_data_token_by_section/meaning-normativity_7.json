    "main_text": "Content || Content Determining Normativity\n3.2 Content Determining Normativity\n\nLike MD normativism, CD normativism is a foundational claim:\nIntentional content is (at least partially) metaphysically determined\nby rules or norms, content facts are, if you will, (at least\npartially) \u201cgrounded\u201d by normative facts. Since the\nrelevant norms or rules govern intentional mental states, the CD\nnormativist typically tries to find a particular kind of state\nplausibly subject to rules or norms that by the same token (at least\npartially) determine contents for states of this kind. As truth and\ninference are intimately connected with both content and belief, the\ndebate focuses on norms for belief.\n\nBesides truth norms like\n (\\(\\NB_1)\\)\n and \\((\\NB_2)\\) above, two further kinds of candidate norms of belief\nhave been discussed: knowledge norms, and norms of\nrationality, justification, or\n inference.[54]\n CD normativism then is the claim that beliefs cannot have content\nunless rules or norms of at least one of these kinds are in force for\nthem. Strong versions of CD normativism hold that CD norms also\ndetermine which contents beliefs have. And again, being in force can\nroughly be interpreted in three ways: As requiring the subject to\nfollow the relevant rule or norm \\(R\\), to accept\n\\(R\\) in a sense not requiring (general) following, or as\nindependent of the subject\u2019s attitudes and intentional states\ntowards \\(R\\) (see above,\n section 2.2.1).\n\nAs in the case of meaning, CD normativism most often is a form of\nguidance normativism construing belief formation as an\nessentially rule-guided activity. Those inspired by pragmatism and/or\nWittgensteinian anti-platonism might also think of the relevant rules\nas \u201cof our own making\u201d (Baker & Hacker 1985; Brandom\n1994). A fairly common idea is that believers follow basic, objective\nnorms such as truth or knowledge norms by means of being\nguided by subjective ones such as the rules of rationality (Boghossian\n2003), but others take subjective rules as\n basic,[55]\n or argue that the nature of belief is given by subjective and\nobjective norms in combination (Wedgwood 2007: 162).\n\nUnsurprisingly, norms or rules for (rational) reasoning\nreceive a lot of attention. Prime examples are inference rules such as\nmodus ponens or the law of non-contradiction. Purely formal\nrules would arguably be too weak for the purposes of strong CD\nnormativism; normative inferentialists such as Brandom (1994; 2000) or\nPeregrin (2008) therefore include norms governing material implication\namong the content determining rules. In general, principles governing\nepistemic rationality (as, for instance, formalized in Bayesian\nepistemology) are further examples, and for those who hold that there\ncan be good practical reasons for belief, principles of practical\nreasoning are also\n relevant.[56]\n\nAs we have already seen in\n section 2.2\n above, regress worries arise if CD normativism takes the form of\nguidance normativism. Here, a pragmatic conception of rule guidance\nsuch as Brandom\u2019s normative version of inferentialism (Brandom\n1994) might help. To avoid regresses, Brandom takes norms implicitly\n\u201cinstituted\u201d by our practices to be basic and proposes a\npragmatic phenomenalism about such norms. Objective\n\u201cdeontic statuses\u201d are to be explained in terms of our\nnormative attitudes. Something\u2019s being correct, that\nis, is to be explained in terms of the attitude of taking it to be\ncorrect, making the norms in question \u201cin some sense\ncreatures of ours\u201d (1994: 626); yet, the goal is to secure and\nexplain the \u201cobjectivity of concepts\u201d (1994:\n xvii).[57]\n As attitudes of taking something to be correct can themselves be\ncorrect or incorrect, being correct ultimately has to be\nexplained in terms of being correctly taken to be correct. In\nthis sense, the normativity is irreducible\u2014it is \u201cnorms\nall the way down\u201d (1994: 44; 625).\n\nQuestions that have been raised for pragmatic phenomenalism include\nwhether it in fact can account for contents the truth of which is\nindependent of our attitudes. Because it explains normative statuses\nby means of further normative statuses, pragmatic phenomenalism might\nnot be able to tell us anything informative about how we make or\n\u201cinstitute\u201d the basic norms implicit in our practices (cf.\nRosen 2001, Hattiangadi 2003) or to account for the difference between\ninstituting and merely being in accordance with a norm. Yet another\nregress worry has also been raised: if for any normative status to be\ninstituted by an implicit norm a further normative status already\nneeds to be so instituted, an infinite regress of (implicit) norms\nmight ensue despite the pragmatist nature of the proposal (cf.\nHattiangadi 2007: 197; Gl\u00fcer & Wikforss 2009: 60ff). This\nregress might not be vicious if the project is interpreted as an\nexpressivist one, however.\n\nEven if guidance normativism would inescapably lead to some form of\nregress, one might still hold on to the claim that there are\ncontentful intentional states only if for instance the rules of\nrationality are in force for them. As we noted already in the previous\nversion of this entry, such force might require acceptance, but not\n(general) guidance, or it might be completely independent of the\nattitudes of thinkers. Highlighting both these options, it has\nrecently been argued that guidance normativism is unnecessarily\ndemanding.\n\nFor one thing, even if the relevant rules require some sort of\nacceptance to be in force, not every performance governed by them\nneeds to actually be guided by them (cf. Hlobil 2015; Tracy 2020).\nPlausible as this might initially seem, especially when thinking along\nthe lines of the game analogy, a general observation of this kind does\nnot yet substantiate the claim that an account of constitutive\nrules\u2019 being in force that implements this possibility would be\napplicable to CD rules or\n norms.[58]\n Moreover, it should be noted that for CD rules or norms, making this\nmove might not just amount to acknowledging that not every instance of\nbelief formation has to be rule-guided. If the move is to stop an\nintentional condition on rule-following from giving rise to a regress,\nwe might end up having to say that every instance of rule-guided\nbelief formation requires the unguided formation of at least\none other belief or intentional state. For every rule that is followed\n(on a particular occasion), that is, there is another that governs,\nbut cannot guide, the formation of a further intentional\nstate of the rule-follower (on that\n occasion).[59]\n This is at least a surprising situation to end up in for a defender\nof the view that belief is essentially governed by rules that can\nguide belief\n formation.[60]\n CD normativism might thus prove viable only if the force of the\nrelevant rules or norms can plausibly be construed in complete\nindependence of the attitudes of the thinkers.\n",
