    "main_text": "Theories || Realist Theories\n2.1 Realist Theories\n\nMost realist theories about boundaries, construed as lower-dimensional\nentities, share the view that such entities are ontological parasites:\npoints, lines, and surfaces cannot be separated and cannot exist in\nisolation from the entities they bound (pace Su\u00e1rez,\nwho thought that God would be capable of such marvels; see\nDisputation 40, V, \u00a741). This view does justice to the\nintuition that boundaries, if real, are somewhat \u201cless\nreal\u201d than the entities they bound, and as such it goes back to\nAristotle (Metaphysics, XI, 1060b12\u201316) and has been\ndefended e.g. by Boethius (Second Commentary I, xi,\n14\u201321), revived by Abelard (Glosses on Porphyry,\n8.1\u20134), and eventually backed up by Brentano (1976) and his\npupils, especially Husserl in his third Logical Investigation\n(1901). Of course, the notion of ontological dependence is itself open\nto several interpretations (see Koslicki 2014 and the entry on\n ontological dependence).\n In the case of boundaries, it is generally agreed that the relevant\nrelation is one of rigid existential dependence: if x is a\nboundary of y, then necessarily x exists only if\ny exists (Chisholm 1984, 1994). Realist theories may differ\nsignificantly, however, with regard to how such rigidly dependent,\nlower-dimensional entities relate to the extended entities they\nbound.\n\nTo illustrate, consider again the first puzzle of Section 1 (owned vs.\nunowned boundaries). Let A and B be any two extended\nentities separated by a common boundary, such as Maryland and\nPennsylvania. Then we may distinguish four main views (Varzi 1997;\nStrobach 1998, pt. II).\n\n(1) The boundary may belong neither to A\nnor to B. This was, ultimately, Leonardo\u2019s\nview (1938: 76) and is perhaps the least popular among recent\nphilosophers (though see e.g. Hestevold 1986 and Schmolze 1996). It\nimplies that contact may obtain between A and B even\nif both A and B are topologically open, so long as\nnothing lies between them except for their common, outer boundary\n\u2014 i.e., so long as the closure of A (A plus\nits boundary) overlaps the closure of B (B plus its\nboundary). So, on this view, there is no last point p of\nMaryland just as there is no first point q of Pennsylvania:\nthe States of the Union do not, strictly speaking, use up the whole\nterritory. In the temporal realm, the view is somewhat more popular\n(Sorensen 1986), for it may be seen as providing a quietist way out of\nthe transition puzzles mentioned in section 1.1. Cf. Epicurus:\n\u201cDeath is nothing to us, since so long as we exist, it is not\nwith us; but when death comes, then we do not exist\u201d (Letter\nto Menoeceus, 1926: 85). On the other hand, it is precisely on\nsuch grounds that some early modern Islamic philosophers, e.g.\nMull\u0101 \u1e62adr\u0101, argued that change of substantial\nnature can never be instantaneous and must therefore be\ngradual: insofar as it is impossible for there to be\n\u201cformless\u201d matter, there can never be an instant when\nsomething has lost the previous form and not yet gained the new one\n(Asf\u0101r, IV, 274).\n\n(2) The boundary belongs either to A\nor to B, though it may be indeterminate to which of\nA and B it belongs. This view builds on\nBolzano\u2019s classic analysis of the continuum (1851: \u00a766),\nwhich in turn is mirrored by the standard account of point-set\ntopology (see e.g. Kelley 1955). It implies that contact may obtain\nbetween A and B only when either A or\nB is topologically closed (i.e., contains its own boundary)\nin the relevant contact area while the other is topologically open,\nthough the appeal to indeterminacy allows one to leave the matter\nunsettled. This indeterminacy, in turn, may be construed as semantic\nor as epistemic, if not metaphysical, depending on whether the\nrelevant boundary is of the fiat sort, as with the\nMason-Dixon line, or of the bona fide sort. (Similarly in the\ntemporal realm; see e.g. Kamp 1980, Le Poidevin 2000, Pickup 2022.)\nAll of this can be explained without resorting to the machinery of\nabstract set theory; a mereotopological account, where the relevant\ntopological distinctions are elucidated in terms of the part-whole\nrelation, provides a viable alternative (Smith 1996; Casati and Varzi\n1999, Ch. 5; Varzi 2007, \u00a72.4.1) and can be suitably adjusted to\nfit even the most liberal views of spatio-temporal receptacles (Hudson\n2001). Nonetheless the view has its costs. From a naive perspective,\nthe distinction between open and (semi-)closed entities may seem\nunwarranted, if not \u201cmonstrous\u201d (as Brentano 1976: 146 put\nit). From a metaphysical perspective, it introduces asymmetries that\nmay be found disturbing, e.g. when it comes to explaining why\ncontact is only possible between entities of opposite sorts (Zimmerman\n1996b), or why each sort will have different part-whole grounding\nproperties (Smid 2015; Calosi 2018).\n\n(3) The boundary may belong both to A\nand to B, but the relevant overlap would be sui\ngeneris precisely insofar as it would involve lower-dimensional\nparts. Modulo the \u201cextended simples\u201d view mentioned in\nSection 1.4, boundaries do not take up space-time and so, on\nthis view, it is not implausible to say that (for example) the\nMason-Dixon line belongs to both Maryland and Pennsylvania. This was\nprobably Aristotle\u2019s own position, according to which\n\u201cthings are called continuous when the touching limits of each\nbecome one\u201d, i.e., \u201cone in number though two in\ndefinition\u201d (Physics, V, 227a11, VIII, 262a20). In some\ncases, however, this theory may require a blunt rejection of the\nprinciple of non-contradiction (Priest 2006, chs. 11ff; Cotnoir and\nWeber 2015; Weber 2021, \u00a71.3). With reference to the\nSu\u00e1rez-Peirce puzzle, for instance, if the line of demarcation\nbetween a black spot and its white background belongs to both, then it\nmust be both white and black. A way out would be to deny that\nboundaries, qua lower-dimensional, can enjoy the same sort of\nproperties that characterize extended bodies, color properties being\namong them (Galton 2003: 167\u2013168). It is unclear, however,\nwhether this conservative strategy can be generalized. For instance, a\ncontradiction would seem to resurface with reference to Plato\u2019s\npuzzle and its variants in the temporal realm (Priest 1982, 1985;\nTanaka 1998): at the instant when a (homogeneous) object undergoes the\ntransition from being stationary to moving it would have to be both\nstationary and moving; at the instant when someone dies, the self-same\nperson would have to be both alive and dead; and so on. Thus, on the\nface of it, this is really a theory that would take us straight to\nHegel: \u201cThe limit is the mediation in virtue of which something\nand other each both is and is not\u201d (1833: 99).\n\n(4) There really are two boundaries, one belonging to\nA and one belonging to B, and these two boundaries\nare co-located \u2014 that is, they coincide spatially without\noverlapping mereologically. This view may be traced back to\nSu\u00e1rez, Disputation 40 (though see Schmaltz 2019 and\n2020, ch. 3, vs. Zimmerman 1996a), was distinctly endorsed by Brentano\n(1976), and in recent times has found many a follower, from Rhees\n(1938) to Sanford (1967) to Chisholm (1984, 1993, 1996), Smith (1997a,\n1999a), and Baumann et al. (2014, 2016). It may also have\nbeen another aspect of Aristotle\u2019s conception, insofar as he\nheld that things can be in contact, or contiguous, without being\ncontinuous in the sense mentioned in (3): in that case, Aristotle\nwrites, \u201ctheir extremities are together\u201d, i.e., \u201care\nin one primary place\u201d (Physics, V, 226b22\u201323; see\nBartha 2001, Pfeiffer 2018, ch. 7, Shatalov 2020, Sattler 2020, ch. 7,\nand Katz 2022 for extensive discussion). Apart from Aristotle\u2019s\npeculiar distinction, however, the main motivation for this view is to\ndo away with the \u201cmonstrous\u201d ontological differentiation\nbetween closed and open entities while preserving the important\ndistinction between contact and overlap. The spatial coincidence of\nboundaries would of course violate Locke\u2019s impenetrability\nprinciple, to the effect that whatever exists anywhere at any time\n\u201cexcludes all of the same kind\u201d (Essay,\nII-xxvii-1). Yet, again, the violation would be sui generis\ninsofar as the entities in question do not take up any space, so one\nneed not find it as outrageous as Bayle, for instance, made it sound\n(see Dictionary, art. Zeno, remark G). Indeed, it\ncould be argued that a coincidence-based account has several\nderivative advantages when it comes to modeling a number of phenomena\nthat are topologically problematic, such as the possibility of\ncollision or the fusion and fission of material bodies (Cotnoir 2019).\nWhether such considerations are enough to block other worries,\nhowever, remains to be determined. For instance, to the extent that\nlines can be colored, it would follow \u2014 as Brentano (1976: 41)\nexplicitly acknowledged \u2014 that the presence of a black spot on a\nwhite background would deliver two coincident boundaries, one black\nand one white. Would that result in something grey? (For discussion,\nsee Massin 2018 and Nu\u00f1ez Erices 2019; see also Chisholm 1980\nand Strobach 1998, ch. II.2, for parallel worries in the temporal\nrealm.)\n\nThese four views are mutually exclusive, but they need not be\nexhaustive and can be further articulated or integrated to address the\nissues raised by the other puzzles of Section 1. For example, with\nreference to the second puzzle (Section 1.2), Smith and Varzi (2000)\nconsider a double-barred theory that is of type (2) with respect to\nbona fide boundaries and of type (4) with respect to\nfiat boundaries (so there is no coincidence of real\nboundaries but merely of fiat articulations). Similarly, the\nindeterminacy hypothesis advocated by type-(2) theories can be\nregarded as being of a piece with the sort of indeterminacy that is\ninvolved in the phenomenon of boundary fuzziness (Section 1.3). For\nfiat boundaries, for instance, a de dicto account\nmay be applied in both cases: statements about such boundaries are\ntrue if and only if they are super-true, i.e., true under every\nadmissible way of precisifying the relevant fiat\narticulations (Varzi 2001 and references therein). There are other\noptions, too. For instance, Hudson (2001; 2005, ch. 3) offers an\naccount of boundaries that permits instances of each of (1), (2) and\n(3) (and without forfeiting the principle of non-contradiction). It is\nalso possible to reject the basic mereotopological setting that leads\nto the taxonomy above and, with it, the need to choose among\n(1)\u2013(4). See, for instance, Breysse and De Glas (2007) for a\nformal proposal in this spirit and Galton (1996, 2004), Donnelly and\nSmith (2003), and Donnelly (2003, 2004) for theories where the\ntreatment of boundaries of different dimensions (e.g. points as\nopposed to lines or surfaces) results in \u201clayered\u201d\nmereotopological systems. Finally, see Kraus (2016) for a theory that\ndoes away altogether with the assumption that boundaries must be\ndependent parts.\n",
