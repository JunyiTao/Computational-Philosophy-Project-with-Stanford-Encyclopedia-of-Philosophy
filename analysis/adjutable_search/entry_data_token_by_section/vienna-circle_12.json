    "main_text": "Selected Doctrines and their Criticisms || The Vienna Circle and History\n4. Concluding Remarks\n\nIn conclusion, the results of the discussions in section 3 can be\nbriefly summarised. To start with, the dominant popular picture of the\nVienna Circle as a monolithic group of simple-minded verificationists\nwho pursued a blandly reductivist philosophy with foundationalist\nambitions is widely off the mark. Instead, the Vienna Circle must be\nseen as a forum in which widely divergent ideas about how empiricism\ncan cope with modern empirical and formal science were discussed.\nWhile by no means all of the philosophical initiatives started by\nmembers of the Vienna Circle have born fruit, it is neither the case\nthat all of them have remained fruitless. Nor is it the case that\neverything once distinctive of Vienna Circle philosophy has to be\ndiscarded.\n\nConsider verificationism. While the idea to show metaphysics\nonce-and-for-all and across-the-board to be not false but\nmeaningless\u2014arguably the most distinctive thesis associated with\nthe Vienna Circle\u2014did indeed have to be abandoned, two elements\nof that program remain so far unrefuted. On the one hand, it remains\nan option to pursue the search for a criterion of empirical\nsignificance in terms of constructed, formal languages further along\nthe lines opened by Carnap with his theory-relative proposal of 1956\n(and its later defense against critics). On the other\nhand\u2014albeit at the cost of merging with the pragmatist tradition\nand losing the apparent Viennese distinctiveness\u2014the option to\nneglect as cognitively irrelevant, and in this sense metaphysical, all\nassertions whose truth or falsity would not make a difference remains\nas open as it always was. In addition it must be noted that, properly\nformulated, neither the formalist version of the criterion of\nempirical significance for constructed languages nor the pragmatist\nversion of the criterion for natural languages are threatened by\nself-refutation.\n\nConsider analyticity. Here again, the traditional idea\u2014sometimes\ndefended by some members\u2014did show itself indefensible, but this\nleaves Carnap\u2019s framework-relative interpretation of analyticity\nand the understanding of the a priori as equally relative\nto be explored. As noted, if Carnap\u2019s ramseyfications can be\ndefended, an analytic/synthetic distinction could be upheld also for\nthe theoretical languages of science. In any case, however, the\ndistinction between framework principles and content continues to be\ndrawable on a case by case basis.\n\nConsider reductionism and foundationalism. While it cannot be denied\nthat various reductionist projects were at one time or another\nundertaken by members of the Vienna Circle and that not all of its\nmembers were epistemological anti-foundationalists either from the\nstart or at the end, it is clearly false to paint all of them with\nreductivist and/or foundationalist brushes. This is particularly true\nof the members of the so-called left wing of the Circle, all of whom\nended up with anti-foundationalist and anti-reductionist positions\n(even though this did involve instrumentalism for some).\n\nConsider also, however, the challenges mentioned above to the\nfundamental tenets of logical empiricism that remain issues of intense\ndiscussion: challenges to its conception of the nature of empirical\ntheory and of what is distinctive about the formal sciences. That to\nthis day no agreement has been reached about how its proposals are to\nbe replaced is not something that is unique to logical empiricism as a\nphilosophical movement, but that they remain on the table, as it were,\nshows the ongoing relevance and centrality of its work for philosophy\nof science.\n\nWhether the indicated qualifications and/or modifications count as\ndefeats of the original project depends at least in part on what\nprecisely is meant to be rejected when metaphysics is rejected and\nthat in turn depends on what the positive vision for philosophy\nconsists in. Here again one must differentiate. While some members\nended with considerable more sympathy for traditional philosophy than\nthey displayed in the Circle\u2019s heyday\u2014and may thus be\ncharged with partial surrender\u2014others stuck to their guns. For\nthem, what remained of philosophy stayed squarely in the deflationist\nvein established by the linguistic turn. They offered explications of\ncontested concepts or practices that, they hoped, would prove useful.\nImportantly, the explications given can be of two sorts: the formal\nexplications of the logic of science by means of exemplary models of\nconstructed languages, and the more informal explications of the\nempirical theory of science given by spelling out how certain\ntheoretical desiderata can be attained more or less under practical\nconstraints. This has been designated as the bipartite metatheory\nconception of scientific philosophy and ascribed to the left wing of\nthe Circle as an ideal unifying its diverse methodologies (Uebel 2007,\nCh. 12, 2015). Readers will note therefore that despite his enormous\ncontribution to the development of Vienna Circle philosophy, it is not\nSchlick\u2019s version of it that appears to this reviewer to be of\ncontinuing relevance to contemporary philosophy\u2014unlike, in their\nvery different but not incompatible ways, Carnap\u2019s and\nNeurath\u2019s and Frank\u2019s. This may be taken as a partial\nendorsement of Hempel\u2019s 1991 judgement (quoted in sect. 1\nabove), against which, however, Carnap has here been re-claimed for\nthe Neurathian wing.\n\nNeedless to say, recent work on Vienna Circle philosophies continues\nto inspire a variety of approaches to the legacy they constitute\n(besides prompting continuing excavations of other members\u2019\nnon-standard variants; e.g., on Feigl see Neuber 2011). There is\nMichael Friedman\u2019s extremely wide-ranging project (2001, 2010,\n2012) to use the shortcomings of Vienna Circle philosophies as a\nspringboard for developing a renewed Kantian philosophy that also\novercomes the failings of neo-Kantianism and provides a\nphilosophy-cum-history fit for our post-Kuhnian times. Then there is\nRichardson\u2019s proposal (2008) to turn the ambition to develop a\nscientific philosophy into a research programme for the history of\nscience, so as to reveal more clearly the real world dynamics and\nlimitations of philosophy as a scientific metatheory. And there is\nCarus\u2019s suggestion (2007) that Carnap\u2019s minimalist\nexplicationism be placed in the service of a renewed Enlightenment\nagenda (continuing the task of the \u201cscientific world\nconception\u201d). This connects with the current metaphilosophical interest in conceptual engineering, the relevance of Carnap\u2019s work to which becoming increasingly recognised (Justus 2012, Wagner 2012, Brun 2016, Reck and Dutilh Novaes 2017, Dutilh Novaes forthcoming, Lutz forthcoming). All along, of course, Vienna Circle philosophies\nalso continue to serve as foils for alternative and self-consciously\npost-positivist programs, fruitfully so when informed by the results of recent\nscholarship (e.g. Ebbs 2017).\n\nIt would appear then that despite continued resistance to recent\nrevisionist scholarship\u2014a resistance that consists not so much\nin contesting but in ignoring its results\u2014the fortune of Vienna\nCircle philosophy has turned again. Restored from the numerous\ndistortions of its teachings that accrued over generations of acolytes\nand opponents, the Vienna Circle is being recognized again as a force\nof considerable philosophical sophistication. Not only is it the case\nthat its members profoundly influenced the actual development of\nanalytical philosophy of science with conceptual initiatives that,\ntypically, were seen through to their bitter end. It is also the case\nthat some of its members offered proposals and suggested approaches\nthat were not taken up widely at the time (if at all), but that are\nrelevant again today. Much like its precursors Frege, Russell and\nWittgenstein, the conventionalists Poincar\u00e9 and Duhem, the\npragmatists Peirce and Dewey\u2014and like its contemporaries from\nReichenbach\u2019s Berlin Group and the Warsaw-Lvov school of logic\nto the Neo-Kantian Cassirer\u2014the Vienna Circle affords a valuable\nvantage point on contemporary philosophy of empirical and formal\nscience.\n",
