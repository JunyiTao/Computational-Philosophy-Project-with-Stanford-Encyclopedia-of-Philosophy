    "main_text": "Some general considerations || Mathematicians\n1.2 Mathematicians\n\nA mathematician might be looking at or studying a discrete or finite\ncounterpart of an existing theory just to see, e.g., what theorems\nremain provable in both cases. This in itself is interesting from the\nperspective of so-called reverse mathematics. The core question is to\nfind out what is necessarily required to prove certain theorems? See,\ne.g., Simpson (2005) and Stillwell (2016). Proofs that also hold in a\ndiscrete geometry are thus independent from any assumption about\ndiscreteness or continuity. One might however go deeper into the\nfoundations of mathematics and study finite geometries from a\nfoundational perspective. One such approach is strict finitism\n(although sometimes the terms ultra-finitism or ultra-intuitionism are\nused as well) that is not meant as a subtheory of other foundational\ntheories but as an alternative on its own. It shares with the many\nforms of constructivism the fundamental view that mathematical objects\nand concepts have to be accessible to the mathematician in terms of\nconstructions that can be executed or performed. The various forms are\ndistinguished from one another as to how the concepts of\n\u201cexecution\u201d or \u201cperformance\u201d are to be\nunderstood. Most constructivists allow for the potentially infinite,\ni.e., if a procedure or algorithm will (provably) terminate at some\nmoment in the future, then the outcome is accepted as constructable.\nSee Bridges & Richman (1987) for an overview and the entry on\n constructive mathematics.\n Strict finitism wants to go one step further and argues that an\nindefinite outcome is not be accepted as an outcome, since, as all\ncomputational resources are finite, it could very well be that these\nresources have been used up before the outcome has been reached. The\nadditional qualification serves to make the distinction with\nHilbert\u2019s finitism which, roughly speaking, can be seen as a\nform of finitism on the meta-level (e.g., although mathematical\ntheories can talk about infinite structures, still the proofs in such\ntheories must have a finite length). As might be expected, strict\nfinitism is not a popular view in the philosophy of mathematics.\nNevertheless a number of proposals have been put forward. A history\nand an account of the actual (though now somewhat dated) state of\naffairs can be found in Welti (1987). In\n section 2\n more will be said about such proposals.\n",
