    "main_text": "Theories of consciousness\n7. Theories of consciousness\n\n\nIn response to the What, How and Why questions many theories of\nconsciousness have been proposed in recent years. However, not all\ntheories of consciousness are theories of the same thing. They vary not\nonly in the specific sorts of consciousness they take as their object,\nbut also in their theoretical aims.\n\n\nPerhaps the largest division is between general metaphysical\ntheories that aim to locate consciousness in the overall ontological\nscheme of reality and more specific theories that offer detailed\naccounts of its nature, features and role. The line between the two\nsorts of theories blurs a bit, especially in so far as many specific\ntheories carry at least some implicit commitments on the more general\nmetaphysical issues. Nonetheless, it is useful to keep the division in\nmind when surveying the range of current theoretical offerings.\n",
