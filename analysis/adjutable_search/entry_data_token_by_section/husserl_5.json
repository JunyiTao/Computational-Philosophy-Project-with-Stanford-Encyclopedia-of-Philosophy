Epoch\u00e9, perceptual noema, h\u00fdle, time-consciousness and phenomenological reduction\n\nThe point of the local epoch\u00e9 can perhaps best be\nbrought out if we follow Husserl in applying it to the case of\nperceptual experience. The phenomenologist is supposed to perform his\nor her descriptions from a first-person point of view, so as\nto ensure that the respective item is described exactly as it is\nexperienced. Now in the case of perceptual experience one cannot, of\ncourse, both fall victim to and at the same time discover a particular\nperceptual error; it is always possible that one is subject to an\nillusion or even a hallucination, so that one\u2019s perceptual\nexperience is not veridical. If one is hallucinating, there is really\nno object of perception. However, phenomenologically the experience\none undergoes is exactly the same as if one were successfully\nperceiving an external object.\n\nTherefore, the (adequacy of a) phenomenological description of a\nperceptual experience should be independent of whether for the\nexperience under investigation there is an object it represents or\nnot. Either way, there will at least be a perceptual content\n(if not the same content on both sides, though). It is this content\nthat Husserl calls the perceptual noema. Thanks to its noema,\neven a hallucination is an intentional act, an experience \u201cas\nof\u201d an object. Phenomenological description is concerned with\nthose aspects of the noema that remain the same irrespective of\nwhether the experience in question is veridical or not. Thus, our\nphenomenologist must not employ\u2014he (or she) must\n\u201cbracket\u201d\u2014his belief in the existence of the\nperceptual object.\n\nHowever, this lands him in a methodological dilemma. If, on the one\nhand, the phenomenologist leaves the \u201cnatural attitude\u201d\nand brackets his corresponding existence-belief, he cannot at the same\ntime perform the perceptual experience he wishes to investigate. (This\nis the first horn of the dilemma.) For, as Husserl himself stresses\n(cf. Ideas, sec. 90, 109), the existence-belief is an\nindispensable part of the perceptual phenomenon: such experiences are\nessentially thetic, i.e., there can be no such thing as a\nperceptual experience without \u201cbelief-character\u201d (cf.\n5th Logical Investigation, sec. 23). If, on the\nother hand, our phenomenologist makes use of that belief, then he is\nbound to violate the constraints put upon him by the local\nepoch\u00e9: he cannot but fail to assume the\nphenomenological attitude. (This is the second horn.)\n\nThere are at least three possible ways out of this dilemma.\nFirst, the phenomenologist could choose the first horn of the\ndilemma, but analyse an earlier perceptual experience of his,\none that he now remembers. He just has to make sure here not to employ\nhis earlier (and perhaps still persisting) belief in the existence of\na perceptual object. Secondly, he could again decide in\nfavour of the first horn and analyse a perceptual experience that he\nmerely intuitively imagines himself to have. (For\nHusserl\u2019s view on imagination see esp. Husserliana,\nvol. XXIII.) Thirdly, he could instead choose the second\nhorn, keep employing his existence-belief, but make a kind of\n\u201cpragmatic ascent\u201d and describe the perceptual\nexperience in such a way that the description, i.e., the speech\nact thus performed, does not presuppose the existence of a\nperceptual object. (The following sort of description may serve that\nfunction: \u201cI am demonstratively identifying a so-and-so\u201d;\n\u201cI am performing an act of this-meaning under the aspect\nso-and-so\u201d.) In any case, Husserl regards\n\u201cbracketing\u201d as what he calls the \u201cneutrality\nmodification\u201d of a positing act, to be distinguished both from a\ncorresponding supposition (hypothesis) and from what is commonly\nreferred to as suspension of judgment, as in a case of serious doubt\n(cf. Hua III/1, 247 ff). While in the latter case the subjective\nprobability may be 0.5, no degree of belief whatsoever can be assigned\nto an act of neutrality-modification (cf. Hua III/1, 252).\n\nIt is not entirely clear if Husserl considers all of these strategies\nto be admissible. The second one is certainly in line with the\nimportant methodological role he ascribes to \u201cphantasy\u201d,\ni.e., mere intuitive imagination, when it comes to eidetic reduction,\nwhich in turn constitutes an important part of the phenomenological\nmethod. The third strategy\u2014pragmatic ascent\u2014fits in well\nwith the way he uses to specify the common element of the noema of\nboth veridical perceptions and corresponding hallucinations (see,\ne.g., the first-person description of someone\u2019s experience of\n\u201cthis blooming tree there in space\u201d presented in sec. 90\nof Ideas; also see ibid., sec. 89f).\n\nNow we can apply the local epoch\u00e9 to specify the noema\nof both veridical perceptions and hallucinations so as to bring out\ntheir singularity. Already in his 1894 essay\n\u201cIntentional Objects\u201d (cf. Husserliana, vol.\nXXII; English translation of a somewhat different version of the essay\nin: Rollinger 1999) Husserl stressed that objectless representations\nsuch as hallucinations can in a sense be characterized as\n\u201crepresenting an intentional object\u201d, provided that this\ncharacterization is understood to be made \u201cunder an existential\nassumption\u201d, as follows: \u201cIf the act of\nhallucination were veridical, it would successfully\nrepresent such-and-such an object (under such-and-such\naspects)\u201d. Something similar goes with regard to the singularity\nof a hallucinatory experience\u2019s noema: if such an experience\nwere veridical, it would, in virtue of its noema, represent a\nparticular perceptual object in all relevant possible worlds (see\nSection 3 above). Thus, we can provide an existentially\nneutral specification of the noema of a (veridical, illusory or\nhallucinatory) perceptual experience, just as local\nepoch\u00e9 demands, and still bring out the singular\ncharacter of their content that Husserl has done so much to uncover,\nespecially in his investigations into indexicality and the role of the\ndeterminable X in our constitution of spatio-temporal\nreality. The specification might run as follows: The noema of a\nperceptual experience i is such that either (1) there is an\nobject x that i represents in virtue of its noema,\nwhere x is to be regarded as the referent of i in\nall relevant possible worlds, or (2) there would be an object meeting\ncondition (1) if i were veridical. Condition (2) enables us\nto make sense of the behaviour of a speaker/thinker making\ncounterfactual assumptions about an object which he, unknowingly,\nmerely hallucinates, or of quantifying into modal statements about\nthat alleged object (cf. Beyer 2000, pp. 26\u201331). Notice that on\nthe above-proposed externalist reading of Husserl\u2019s notion of\nintentional content, the noema will differ depending on whether\ncondition (1) or (2) is satisfied. Nevertheless, our noematic\nspecification meets the requirements of local epoch\u00e9,\nas it does not rely on the existence of a particular perceptual\nobject. If there is no such object, condition (2) will be\nsatisfied\u2014provided that we are dealing with a perceptual\nexperience. The rationale behind condition (2) is that even in the\nnon-veridical case an individual notion (a mental file) and\nconsequently a unified series of intentional horizons gets activated,\non the basis of the same sensory material, or h\u00fdle\n(see the following paragraph), as in the veridical case.\n\nIt should be noted that according to Husserl the complete noema of a\nperceptual experience contains an additional element, to be\ndistinguished from the intentional content, notably its\n\u201cthetic\u201d or \u201cpositing\u201d character, i.e., its\nquality. Moreover, the manner in which the perceptual object (if any)\npresents (or would present) itself includes the sensual matter or\n\u201ch\u00fdle\u201d underlying the respective\nperceptual experience. Typical examples of h\u00fdle\ninclude sense impressions (i.e., sensory experiences), as opposed to\nthe perceptual experiences based upon them. Thus, to take\nJastrow\u2019s/Wittgenstein\u2019s duck-rabbit head as an example,\nthe perception of a duck-head may be founded in the same sense\nimpressions or h\u00fdle as the perception of a rabbit-head\n(cf. F\u00f8llesdal 1988, pp. 108f). (For Husserl all remaining\nintuitive acts involve something analogous (in a sense needing further\nexplanation) to h\u00fdle, which he labels as their\n\u201cintuitive representational content\u201d. In the case of acts\nof phantasy, he refers to the intuitive representational content as\n\u201cphantasma\u201d.) Husserl regards sense impressions\nas non-intentional (and thus non-conceptual) in nature. It is only the\nintentional content of a perceptual experience that\n\u201cforms\u201d its underlying h\u00fdle so as to yield\nthe perception of an object (for critical discussion see Hopp 2011,\nesp. sec. 7.3). Husserl compares this process of intentional\n\u201cforming\u201d of sensual matter to the interpretation of a\nlinguistic expression, but this comparison should not mislead us to\nconclude that he subscribes to a sense-datum theory of perception (see\nSection 2 above, headword: mental image theory). Rather, his view on\nperception is best characterized as a sophisticated version of direct\n(i.e., non-representationalist) realism.\n\nFinally, we should note that on Husserl\u2019s view there is a\nfurther important dimension to perceptual experience, in that it\ndisplays a phenomenological deep- or micro-structure constituted by\ntime-consciousness (Husserliana, vol. X, XXXIII;\nalso see Miller 1984). This merely seemingly unconscious structure is\nessentially indexical in character and consists, at a given time, of\nboth retentions, i.e., acts of immediate memory of what has\nbeen perceived \u201cjust a moment ago\u201d, original\nimpressions, i.e., acts of awareness of what is perceived\n\u201cright now\u201d, and protentions, i.e., immediate\nanticipations of what will be perceived \u201cin a moment\u201d. It\nis by such momentary structures of retentions, original impressions\nand protentions that moments of time are continuously constituted (and\nreconstituted) as past, present and future, respectively, so that it\nlooks to the experiencing subject as if time were permanently flowing\noff.\n\nThis deep-structure of intentional consciousness comes to light in the\ncourse of what Husserl calls the \u201cphenomenological\nreduction\u201d (Husserliana, vol. XIII, pp. 432 ff), which\nuses the method of epoch\u00e9 in order to make coherent\nsense, in terms of the essential horizon-structure of consciousness,\nof the transcendence of objective reality. The most global form of\nepoch\u00e9 is employed when this reality in total is\nbracketed. There is still something left at this point, though, which\nmust not, and cannot, be bracketed: the temporal flow of one\u2019s\n\u201cpresent\u201d experience, constituted by current retentions\nand original impressions. These recurrent temporal features of the\nhorizon-structure of consciousness cannot be meaningfully doubted.\nThey provide a kind of h\u00fdle for \u201cinner\nperception\u201d and corresponding reflective judgements, but it is a\nvery special kind of h\u00fdle: one that is a proper part\nof the \u201cperceived\u201d item and does not get conceptually\n\u201cformed\u201d in the course of perception (reflecting the fact\nthat unlike spatio-temporal objects, lived experiences \u201cdo not\nadumbrate themselves\u201d; cf. Husserliana, vol. III/1, p.\n88). Hence, there is no epistemically problematic gap between\nexperience and object in this case, which therefore provides an\nadequate starting point for the phenomenological reduction, that may\nnow proceed further by using holistic justification strategies. After\nall, intentional consciousness has now been shown to be coherently\nstructured at its phenomenologically deepest level.\n",
