    "main_text": "Origins and Development of Russell\u2019s Logical Atomism || Classes, Propositions and Truth in Principia Mathematica\n2.4 Classes, Propositions and Truth in Principia Mathematica\n\n \nIn POM, Russell had postulated two types of composite\nentities: unities and aggregates (POM,\n140f). By a \u201cunity\u201d he meant a complex entity in which the constituent\nparts are arranged with a definite structure. A proposition was\nunderstood to be a unity in this sense.  By an \u201caggregate\u201d, he meant\nan entity such as a class whose identity conditions are governed\nentirely by what members or \u201cparts\u201d it has, and not by any\nrelationships between the parts. By the time of the publication of the\nfirst edition of Principia Mathematica in 1910, Russell\u2019s\nviews about both types of composite entities had changed drastically.\n\n\nRussell fundamentally conceived of a class as the extension of a\nconcept, or as the extension of a propositional function; indeed, in\nPOM he claims that \u201ca class may be defined as all\nthe terms satisfying some propositional function\u201d (POM,\n20). However, Russell was aware already at the time of POM\nthat the supposition there is always a class, understood as an\nindividual entity, as the extension of every propositional function,\nleads to certain logical paradoxes. Perhaps the most famous, now\ncalled \u201cRussell\u2019s paradox\u201d, derived from consideration of the class,\nw, of all classes not members of themselves. The class\nw would be a member of itself if it satisfied its defining\ncondition, i.e., if it were not a member of itself. Similarly,\nw would not be a member of itself if it did not satisfy its\ndefining condition, i.e., if it were a member of itself.  Hence, both\nthe assumption that it is a member of itself, and the assumption that\nit is not, are impossible. Another related paradox Russell often\ndiscussed in this regard has since come to be called \u201cCantor\u2019s\nparadox\u201d. Cantor had proven that if a class had n members,\nthat the number of sub-classes that can be taken from that class is\n2n, and also that 2n >\nn, even when n is infinite. It follows from this\nthat the number of subclasses of the class of all individuals, (i.e.,\nthe number of different classes of individuals) is greater than the\nnumber of individuals.  Russell took this as strong evidence that a\nclass of individuals could not itself be considered an\nindividual. Likewise, the number of subclasses of the class of all\nclasses is greater than the number of members in the class of all\nclasses. This Russell took to be evidence that there is some ambiguity\nin the notion of a \u201cclass\u201d so that the subclasses of the class of \u201call\nclasses\u201d would not themselves be among its members, as it would\nseem.\n\n \nRussell spent the years between 1902 and 1910 searching for a\nphilosophically motivated solution to such paradoxes. He tried\nsolutions of various sorts.  However, in late 1905, after the\ndiscovery of the theory of descriptions, he became convinced that an\nexpression for a class is an \u201cincomplete symbol\u201d, i.e., that while\nsuch an expression can occur as part of a meaningful sentence, it\nshould not be regarded as representing a single entity in the\ncorresponding proposition. Russell dubbed this approach the \u201cno\nclasses\u201d theory of classes (see e.g., TNOT, 145), because,\nwhile it allows discourse about classes to be meaningful, it does not\nposit classes as among the fundamental ontological furniture of the\nworld.  The precise nature of Russell\u2019s \u201cno classes\u201d theory underwent\nsignificant changes between 1905 and 1910. However, in the version\nadopted in the first edition of Principia Mathematica,\nRussell believed that a statement apparently about a class could\nalways be reconstructed, using higher-order quantification, in terms\nof a statement involving its defining propositional function. Russell\nbelieved that whenever a class term of the form\n\u201c{z|\u03c8z}\u201d appeared in some sentence, the sentence\nas a whole could be regarded as defined as follows (cf. PM,\n188):\n\nf({z|\u03c8z}) \u00a0\n=df \u00a0\n(\u2203\u03c6)((x)(\u03c6!x \u2261 \u03c8x)\n& f(\u03c6))\n\n\n\n \nThe above view can be paraphrased, somewhat crudely, as the claim that\nany truth seemingly about a class can be reduced to a claim about some\nor all of its members. For example, it follows from this contextual\ndefinition of class terms that the statement to the effect that one\nclass A is a subset of another class B is equivalent\nto the claim that whatever satisfies the defining propositional\nfunction of A also satisfies the defining propositional\nfunction of B. Russell also sometimes described this as the\nview that classes are \u201clogical constructions\u201d, not part of the \u201creal\nworld\u201d, but only the world of logic. Another way Russell expressed\nhimself is by saying that a class is a \u201clogical fiction\u201d.  While it\nmay seem that a class term is representative of an entity, according\nto Russell, class terms are meaningful in a different way.  Classes\nare not among the basic stuff of the world; yet it is possible to make\nuse of class terms in significant speech, as if there were\nsuch things as classes. A class is thus portrayed by Russell as a mere\nfa\u00e7on de parler, or convenient way of speaking about\nall or some of the entities satisfying some propositional\nfunction.\n\n \nDuring the period in which Russell was working on Principia\nMathematica, most likely in 1907, Russell also radically revised\nhis former realism about propositions understood as mind independent\ncomplexes. The motivations for the change are a matter of some\ncontroversy, but there are at least two possible sources. The first is\nthat in addition to the logical paradoxes concerning the existence of\nclasses, Russell was aware of certain paradoxes stemming from the\nassumption that propositions could be understood as individual\nentities. One such paradox was discussed already in Appendix B of\nPOM (527\u201328). By Cantor\u2019s theorem, there must be more classes\nof propositions than propositions.  However, for every class of\npropositions, m, it is possible to generate a distinct\nproposition, such as the proposition that every proposition in m\nis true, in violation of Cantor\u2019s theorem. Unlike the other\nparadoxes mentioned above, a version of this paradox can be\nreformulated even if talk of classes is replaced by talk of their\ndefining propositional functions.  Russell was also aware of certain\ncontingent paradoxes involving propositions, such as the Liar paradox\nformulated involving a person S, whose only assertion at time\nt is the proposition All propositions asserted by S at\ntime t are false. Given the success of the rejection of classes\nas ultimate entities in resolving the paradoxes of classes, Russell\nwas motivated to see if a similar solution to these paradoxes could be\nhad by rejecting propositions as singular entities.\n\n \nAnother set of considerations pushing Russell towards the rejection of\nhis former view of propositions is more straightforwardly\nmetaphysical.  According to his earlier view, and that of Moore, a\nproposition was understood as a mind independent complex. The\nconstituents of the complex are the actual entities involved, and\nhence, as we have seen, when a proposition is true, it is the same\nentity as a fact or state of affairs. However, because some\npropositions are false, this view of propositions posits objective\nfalsehoods. The false proposition that Venus orbits Neptune\nis thought to be a complex containing Venus and Neptune the planets,\nas well as the relation of orbiting, with the relation occurring as a\nrelation, i.e., as relating Venus to Neptune. However, it\nseems natural to suppose that the relation of orbiting could only\nunite Venus and Neptune into a complex, if in fact, Venus orbits\nNeptune. Hence, the presence of such objective falsehoods is itself\nout of sorts with common sense. Worse, as Russell explained, positing\nthe existence of objective falsehoods in addition to objective truths\nmakes the difference between \u201ctruth\u201d and\n\u201cfalsehood\u201d inexplicable, as both become irreducible\nproperties of propositions, and we are left without an explanation for\nthe privileged metaphysical status of truth over falsehood (see, e.g.,\nNTF, 152).\n\n \nWhatever his primary motivation, Russell abandoned any commitment to\nobjective falsehoods, and restructured his ontology of facts, and\nadopted a new correspondence theory of truth. In the terminology of\nthe new theory, the word \u201cproposition\u201d was used not for an objective\nmetaphysical complex, but simply for an interpreted declarative\nsentence, an item of language.  Propositions are thought to be true or\nfalse depending on their correspondence, or lack thereof, with\nfacts. \n\n \nIn the Introduction to Principia Mathematica, as part of his\nexplanation of ramified type-theory, Russell described various notions\nof truth applicable to different types of propositions of different\ncomplexity. The simplest propositions in the language of Principia\nMathematica are what Russell there called \u201celementary\npropositions\u201d, which take forms such as \u201ca has quality\nq\u201d, \u201ca has relation [in intension] R to\nb\u201d, or \u201ca and b and c stand in\nrelation S\u201d (PM, 43\u201344). Such propositions\nconsist of a simple predicate, representing either a quality or a\nrelation, and a number of proper names. According to Russell, such a\nproposition is true when there is a corresponding fact or complex,\ncomposed of the entities named by the predicate and proper names\nrelated to each other in the appropriate way. E.g., the proposition\n\u201ca has relation R to b\u201d is true if there\nexists a corresponding complex in which the entity a is\nrelated by the relation R to the entity b. If there\nis no corresponding complex, then the proposition is false.\n\n \nRussell dubbed the notion of truth applicable to elementary\npropositions \u201cfirst truth\u201d. This notion of truth serves as\nthe ground for a hierarchy of different notions of truth applicable to\ndifferent types of propositions depending on their complexity. A\nproposition such as \u201c(x)(x has\nquality q)\u201d which involves a first-order quantifier,\nhas (or lacks) \u201csecond truth\u201d depending on whether its\ninstances have \u201cfirst truth\u201d. In this case,\n\u201c(x)(x has quality q)\u201d would be\ntrue if every proposition got by replacing the\n\u201cx\u201d in \u201cx has\nquality q\u201d with the proper name of an individual has\n\u201cfirst truth\u201d (PM, 42). A proposition involving\nthe simplest kind of second-order quantifier, i.e., a quantifier using\na variable for \u201cpredicative\u201d propositional functions of\nthe lowest type, would have or lack \u201cthird truth\u201d\ndepending on whether its allowable substitution instances have second\n(or lower) truth.  Because any statement apparently about a class of\nindividuals involves this sort of higher-order quantification, the\ntruth or falsity of such a proposition will ultimately depend on the\ntruth or falsity of various elementary propositions about its\nmembers. \n\n \nAlthough Russell did not use the phrase \u201clogical atomism\u201d in the\nIntroduction to Principia Mathematica, in many ways it\nrepresents the first work of Russell\u2019s atomist period. Russell there\nexplicitly endorsed the view that the \u201cuniverse consists of objects\nhaving various qualities and standing in various relations\u201d\n(PM, 43).  Propositions that assert that an object has a\nquality, or that multiple objects stand in a certain relation, were\ngiven a privileged place in the theory, and explanation was given as\nto how more complicated truths, including truths about classes, depend\non the truth of such simple propositions. Russell\u2019s work over the next\ntwo decades consisted largely in refining and expanding upon this\npicture of the world.\n",
