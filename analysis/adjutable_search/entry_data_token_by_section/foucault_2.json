    "main_text": "Major Works\n3. Major Works\n\nSince its beginnings with Socrates, philosophy has typically involved\nthe project of questioning the accepted knowledge of the day. Later,\nLocke, Hume, and especially, Kant developed a distinctively modern\nidea of philosophy as the critique of knowledge. Kant\u2019s great\nepistemological innovation was to maintain that the same critique that\nrevealed the limits of our knowing powers could also reveal necessary\nconditions for their exercise. What might have seemed just contingent\nfeatures of human cognition (for example, the spatial and temporal\ncharacter of its perceptual objects) turn out to be necessary truths.\nFoucault, however, suggests the need to invert this Kantian move.\nRather than asking what, in the apparently contingent, is actually\nnecessary, he suggests asking what, in the apparently necessary, might\nbe contingent. The focus of his questioning is the modern human\nsciences (biological, psychological, social). These purport to offer\nuniversal scientific truths about human nature that are, in fact,\noften mere expressions of ethical and political commitments of a\nparticular society. Foucault\u2019s critical philosophy undermines\nsuch claims by exhibiting how they are the outcome of contingent\nhistorical forces, not scientifically grounded truths. Each of his\nmajor books is a critique of historical reason.\n",
