    "main_text": "Principal Contributions || Aesthetics\n3.4 Aesthetics\n\nBosanquet\u2019s writings on art and aesthetics are not as well known\nas those of the third generation idealist, R.G. Collingwood\n(1889\u20131943) or of his Italian late contemporary Benedetto Croce\n(1866\u20131952). Yet Bosanquet was the author of the first history\nof aesthetics in English\u2014described by Monroe C. Beardsley as a\n\u201cpioneering work\u201d (1966: 14) that was the only\ncomprehensive study of aesthetics in English for half a\ncentury\u2014and he was referred to by the literary scholar and\nOxford Professor of Poetry, A.C. Bradley as \u201cthe only British\nphilosopher of the first rank who had dealt fully with this branch of\nphilosophy [i.e., aesthetics]\u201d (A.C. Bradley, p. 570).\n\nBosanquet had a life-long interest in the arts, and his writings are\nreplete with examples and illustrations taken from them. He read\nwidely, particularly poetry, from the classics to the moderns, and for\nseveral years served on the (London) Council of the Home Arts and\nIndustries Association. Among his early works was a translation of The\nIntroduction to Hegel\u2019s Philosophy of Fine Art\n(1886)\u2014to which he wrote an important introduction\u2014and he\nwas the author of several articles on aesthetics, A History of\nAesthetic (1892), a series of lectures on aesthetics given to the\nLondon Ethical Society (1895\u201396), and Three Lectures on\nAesthetic (1915). \n\nBosanquet\u2019s aesthetics shows a debt to Hegel, to the Romantic\npoets, to the Arts and Crafts movement, and to the philosophy of\nHermann Lotze (1817\u20131881). Bosanquet was particularly inspired\nby Hegel\u2019s views on the function and the development of art, but\nhe was also influenced by the Romantic movement and its disciples\n(e.g., J.W. Goethe, F.W.J. Schelling, and William Wordsworth\u2014but\nalso S.T. Coleridge, Robert Southey, and William Blake), a movement\nthat, interestingly, Hegel had disparaged. The Romantics\u2019\nemphasis on unity, the importance of art as a form of self-expression\nessential to the development of the self, and the organic conception\nof nature all have an important place in Bosanquet\u2019s work. But\nother Romantic themes were not adopted so readily. Bosanquet rejected\nany emphasis of emotion over reason, and he acknowledged the\nimportance of limits to art and to artistic activity in general. \n\nFor Bosanquet, art is revelatory of the \u2018spiritual\u2019\ncharacter of the world, and aesthetics is important because it is a\ndisciplined attempt to understand how artists and artworks contribute\nto this. Bosanquet\u2019s work in aesthetics focused on four\nprincipal issues: i) the nature and evolution of aesthetic\nconsciousness, ii) artistic production, iii) aesthetic\nappreciation\u2014particularly, the experience of beauty, ugliness,\nand the sublime in art, and iv) the role of art in the development of\ncharacter. Throughout, Bosanquet writes that he is simply following\nHegel\u2019s lead\u2014though his work is clearly a development\nrather than a repetition of Hegel\u2019s views. \n\nThe first issue, aesthetic consciousness, is discussed at length in\nBosanquet\u2019s A History of Aesthetic (and, to an extent,\nin his introductory essay to The Introduction to Hegel\u2019s\nPhilosophy of Fine Art). In A History of Aesthetic, for\nexample, Bosanquet describes the gradual recognition, over the course\nof European history, of art as a synthesis of content and expression.\nHe traces the continuity and \u2018interruption\u2019 in the\nunderstanding of art and the beautiful, from the classical Greek model\n(with its idea that \u201cart... is symbolic\u201d), through the\nmiddle ages, to the beginnings of a concrete synthesis in Schiller and\nGoethe, and then towards a \u201csynthesis of content and expression\nin that \u2018characteristic\u2019 which overmasters the mind and\nfeeling\u201d (History of Aesthetic, p. 458) which he finds\nin Ruskin\u2019s analysis of \u201cthe penetrative\nimagination\u201d. While Hegel had earlier held that there was a\ndevelopment in consciousness over time\u2014that at one point\nincludes aesthetic consciousness\u2014Bosanquet was not committed to\nthe Hegelian claim that aesthetic consciousness developed\ndialectically. \n\nFor Bosanquet, aesthetics is importantly connected to metaphysics;\nunderstanding art and the work of the artist requires a broader\nmetaphysical and logical theory. (It is this relation between the\nmetaphysical and the aesthetic, developed in Bosanquet\u2019s later\nwritings, that led Dorothy Emmet to write that Bosanquet\u2019s\nThree Lectures on Aesthetic was his \u201cmost successful\nbook\u201d [Emmet 1998: 28].) For Bosanquet, aesthetic experience was\ncharacteristic of the higher experiences we have that give us insight\ninto the full nature of reality, and features of such experiences were\nfeatures that one also finds in logic and metaphysics. Art, then, can\nhelp not only in understanding other aspects of the world, but by\nrevealing something of the \u201cspiritual\u201d character of the\nworld. \n\nThe second major issue that Bosanquet focused on was what is\u2014and\nwhat is involved in the production of\u2014a work of art. Here, too,\nBosanquet\u2019s treatment of this topic goes beyond Hegel\u2019s;\nit also anticipates elements later found in Collingwood and Croce.\n\n\nThe creation of a work of art, according to Bosanquet, is an\nexpression of spirit or feeling; some see Bosanquet as articulating a\nnascent expression theory of art. Yet Bosanquet held that there is\nalso a content communicated in a work of art, and so it is\n\u201crepresentative\u201d (Three Lectures, p.\n57)\u2014not in the sense of copying a natural object, but as\nembodying the \u2018soul\u2019 or essence of an object or a feeling\nin a new medium. (Here, Bosanquet is clearly influenced by\nHegel\u2019s view that beauty exists when the Idea is embodied in\nsensuous form.) While artists have some preconception of the effect\nthey wish to produce in the work of art, they also learn as they\nengage in the activity itself. A work of art, then, is a product of a\nprocess of expression, but this expression must normally be completed\nin an object in the \u2018physical\u2019 world. Thus, Bosanquet\ninsists, while a work of art originates in the subjective, it is also\nsomething objective. He writes: \n\n\nFeeling, [\u2026] in order to be capable of utterance in determinate\nform, must take on an objective character. (Value and Destiny of\nthe Individual, p. 43) \n\n\nWhile some have suggested that Bosanquet\u2019s account of the\nembodiment of a feeling in a work of art is unclear (Kobayashi 2009:\n166), Bosanquet would likely reply that such a concern is addressed by\nhis view that a work of art is a \u201cconcrete\nuniversal\u201d\u2014that it possesses an organisation and a unity\nthat shows a relation of interdependence among its parts, and it\npresents certain general principles in a concrete form. \n\nThe third principal issue that concerned Bosanquet is what happens\nwhen a person encounters a work of art, i.e., aesthetic appreciation.\nIn his Three Lectures on Aesthetic, Bosanquet analyses the\n\u201caesthetic attitude\u201d which, he says, is an activity not of\nthe mind alone, but of the whole\nperson\u2014\u201cbody-and-mind\u201d. (This issue of the connexion\nof body and mind is discussed at length in Lecture V of The\nPrinciple of Individuality and Value.) Although Bosanquet is an\nidealist, he is an objective idealist, and holds that, like\nperception, aesthetic experience involves the whole person. \n\nOn Bosanquet\u2019s view, the aesthetic attitude is\n\u201ccontemplative\u201d\u2014it is a \u201cpreoccupation with a\npleasant feeling, embodied in an object which can be\ncontemplated\u201d (Three Lectures, p. 10). But the work of\nart is also something in which the spectator finds his or her feelings\n\u201cexpressed\u201d. Bosanquet writes that when we\n\u201cimaginatively contemplate\u201d an art object, we are\n\u201cable [\u2026] to live in it as an embodiment of our\nfeeling\u201d (Three Lectures, p. 30); there is no ultimate\ndistinction between art and the feelings it evokes in us. Moreover,\nthe appreciation of a work of art requires understanding it as a whole\nor as a unity\u2014and so it must be organisational. This\norganisational character refers not only to elements or features\nwithin the art object itself, but to the environment in which the work\ncomes to be. Further, Bosanquet argued that art (and aesthetic\nconsciousness) have their basis only in a community. Art, then, is\nsocial and public\u2014so far as both the artist and the spectator\nare epistemically dependent on the communities in which they live.\n\n\nBosanquet\u2019s discussion of aesthetic appreciation in the\nThree Lectures also addressed such questions as the forms of\naesthetic satisfaction and the different \u201ckinds\u201d of\nbeauty\u2014beauty being understood as more than what is\naesthetically pleasing. It is here that most of the critical attention\nto his work (e.g., by John Dewey 1893) has been focussed. Bosanquet\nargues that while beauty is sometimes\n\u201ceasy\u201d\u2014accessible to and recognisable by\nall\u2014the excellence of certain beautiful items may be evident\nonly to those possessing \u201caesthetic insight\u201d. Because of\nthe \u201cintricacy\u201d or complexity of the components of a work\nof art, some might consider an aesthetically excellent object to be an\nugly one. This, Bosanquet writes, is a mistake. Ugliness is, Bosanquet\nargues, strictly speaking a failure in expression. Ugliness in art\nmust not be confused with \u201cdifficult art\u201d\u2014i.e., art\nthat is beautiful, though many may fail to appreciate it. (For a\nrecent discussion of \u2018difficulty\u2019 in art, see Perricone\n2018.) \n\nBosanquet\u2019s fourth principal concern in aesthetics was with the\nrole of art in the development of character. In several early essays\n(from 1886 to 1890), he emphasised how art leads to an expansion of\nthe self\u2014of the artist, in creating the work of art, but also of\nthe spectator, in appreciating the work. (Bosanquet followed William\nMorris and John Ruskin in holding that this result follows as much\nfrom \u201cartistic handiwork\u201d as from \u201cfine art\u201d.)\nIn the short term, aesthetic appreciation leads to a greater ability\nto appreciate not only art but life. But, as indicated earlier,\nBosanquet also maintains that in the long term\u2014here, agreeing\nwith Hegel\u2014art is a vehicle for the recognition of insights\nconcerning the unity of reality, and for an experience of something\ngreater than ourselves. \n\nWhile Bosanquet\u2019s aesthetics is close to the expression theory\nassociated with Collingwood and Croce, and while there is a continuity\nbetween Bosanquet\u2019s work and Collingwood\u2019s early studies\nin aesthetics, Bosanquet was a sharp critic of Croce. Bosanquet holds\nthat any adequate aesthetic theory must leave room for externality in\nart, and so he thinks that any theory that calls into question\n\u201cthe reality of the external world\u201d\u2014which he\nbelieves Croce\u2019s does\u2014cannot provide an accurate portrayal\nof the unity of the world. Bosanquet also challenges, for example, the\nclaim that art is prior to the conceptual and the philosophical. He\nargues that Croce ignores that \u201cthe aesthetic attitude is\nlearnt\u201d (\u201cCroce\u2019s \u00e6sthetic\u201d, in\nCollected Works, Vol. 1, p. 113), and that if language is just\nexpression, not only are logic and conceptual meaning are excluded\nfrom it, but we get a metaphysical \u201csingleness\u201d without\nsubstance, content, or \u201cdefinite meaning\u201d. Finally,\nBosanquet writes that Croce fails to provide an adequate statement of\nthe relation between the aesthetic, nature, and the metaphysical. By\nrestricting the aesthetic to the realm of art, Croce ignores the role\nthat the beauty of nature has in calling us \u201cout of\nourselves\u201d and to the recognition of what is real. \n\nBosanquet\u2019s account of the production of the work of art and the\nnature of aesthetic appreciation is arguably an advance on Hegel, not\nonly in the understanding of art and aesthetic experience as something\nmore than a prelude to Religion, but in re-situating them within the\nhistory of the development of consciousness. (Consequently, he denied\nwhat he saw to be the Crocean interpretation of Hegel: that, at some\npoint, art\u2014as uniquely expressing certain truths\u2014would\ncease to have a function, and be superseded by another form of\nconsciousness.) Moreover, Bosanquet\u2019s view that art is an\nexpression of emotion\u2014later articulated and developed by Croce\nand Collingwood\u2014may nevertheless be able to avoid some of the\ncriticisms raised against these later formulations. While Kobayashi\nhas argued that this account fails to explain how the aesthetic\nsentiment or feeling can be shared by the artist and spectators (2009:\n166), Bosanquet would likely respond that an explanation is to be\nfound in his account of the work of art as a concrete universal. Some\nstudies (e.g., by Morigi 2001) have suggested that there are insights\nwithin Bosanquet\u2019s work that warrant further investigation of\nidealist aesthetics, and others argue that Bosanquet\u2019s analyses\nof aesthetic judgement and aesthetic consciousness may plausibly bear\non other fields (e.g., politics) concerning matters related to self\nconsciousness and our relations to other persons. \n",
