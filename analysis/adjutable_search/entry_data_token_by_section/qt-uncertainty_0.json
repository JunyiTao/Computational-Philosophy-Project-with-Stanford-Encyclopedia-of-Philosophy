    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nThe uncertainty principle is certainly one of the most famous aspects\nof quantum mechanics. It has often been regarded as the most\ndistinctive feature in which quantum mechanics differs from classical\ntheories of the physical world. Roughly speaking, the uncertainty\nprinciple (for position and momentum) states that one cannot assign\nexact simultaneous values to the position and momentum of a physical\nsystem. Rather, these quantities can only be determined with some\ncharacteristic \u201cuncertainties\u201d that cannot become\narbitrarily small simultaneously. But what is the exact meaning of\nthis principle, and indeed, is it really a principle of quantum\nmechanics? (In his original work, Heisenberg only speaks of\nuncertainty relations.) And, in particular, what does it mean to say\nthat a quantity is determined only up to some uncertainty? These are\nthe main questions we will explore in the following, focusing on the\nviews of Heisenberg and Bohr.\n\nThe notion of \u201cuncertainty\u201d occurs in several different\nmeanings in the physical literature. It may refer to a lack of\nknowledge of a quantity by an observer, or to the experimental\ninaccuracy with which a quantity is measured, or to some ambiguity in\nthe definition of a quantity, or to a statistical spread in an\nensemble of similarly prepared systems. Also, several different names\nare used for such uncertainties: inaccuracy, spread, imprecision,\nindefiniteness, indeterminateness, indeterminacy, latitude, etc. As we\nshall see, even Heisenberg and Bohr did not decide on a single\nterminology for quantum mechanical uncertainties. Forestalling a\ndiscussion about which name is the most appropriate one in quantum\nmechanics, we use the name \u201cuncertainty principle\u201d simply\nbecause it is the most common one in the literature.\n",
