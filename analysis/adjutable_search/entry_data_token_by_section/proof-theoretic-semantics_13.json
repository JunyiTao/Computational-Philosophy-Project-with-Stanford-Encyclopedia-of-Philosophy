    "main_text": "Extensions and alternatives to standard proof-theoretic semantics || Harmony and reflection in the sequent calculus\n3.3 Harmony and reflection in the sequent calculus\n\nGentzen\u2019s sequent calculus exhibits a symmetry between right and\nleft introduction rules which suggest to look for a harmony principle\nthat makes this symmetry significant for proof-theoretic semantics. At\nleast three lines have been pursued to deal with this phenomenon. (i)\nEither the right-introduction or or the left-introduction rules are\nconsidered to be introduction rules. The opposite rules\n(left-introductions and right-introductions, respectively) are then\njustified using the corresponding elimination rules. This means that\nthe methods discussed before are applied to whole sequents rather than\nformulas within sequents. Unlike these formulas, the sequents are not\nlogically structured. This approach builds on definitional reflection,\nwhich applies harmony and inversion to rules for arbitrarily\nstructured entities rather than for logical compounds only. It has\nbeen pursued by de Campos Sanz and Piecha (2009). (ii) The right- and\nleft-introduction rules are derived from a characterization in the\nsense of Do\u0161en\u2019s double line rules (section\n 2.4),\n which is then read as a definition of some sort. The top-down\ndirection of a double-line rule is already a right- or a\nleft-introduction rule. The other one can be derived from the\nbottom-up direction by means of certain principles. This is the basic\nmeaning-theoretic ingredient of Sambin et al.\u2019s Basic\nLogic (Sambin, Battilotti, and Faggian, 2000). (iii) The right-\nand left-introduction rules are seen as expressing an interaction\nbetween sequents using the rule of cut. Given either the right- or the\nleft-rules, the complementary rules express that everything that\ninteracts with its premisses in a certain way so does with its\nconclusion. This idea of interaction is a generalized symmetric\nprinciple of definitional reflection. It can be considered to be a\ngeneralization of the inversion principle, using the notion of\ninteraction rather than the derivability of consequences (see\nSchroeder-Heister, 2013). All three approaches apply to the sequent\ncalculus in its classical form, with possibly more than one formula in\nthe succedent of a sequent, including structurally restricted versions\nas investigated in linear and other logics. Therefore this topic\ntouches very much the issue of substructural logic and of\nsubstructural approaches to proof-theoretic semantics (see section\n 3.10).\n",
