    "main_text": "Alienation and Human Flourishing || Alienation and Capitalism\n2.3 Alienation and Capitalism\n\nMarx seems to hold various views about the historical location and\ncomparative extent of alienation. These include: that some systematic\nforms of alienation\u2014presumably including religious\nalienation\u2014existed in pre-capitalist societies; that systematic\nforms of alienation\u2014including alienation in work\u2014are only\na feature of class divided societies; that systematic forms of\nalienation are greater in contemporary capitalist societies than in\npre-capitalist societies; and that not all human societies are scarred\nby class division, in particular, that a future classless society\n(communism) will not contain systematic forms of alienation.\n\nMarx maintains that alienation flows from capitalist social relations,\nand not from the kind of technological advances that capitalist\nsociety contains. His disapproval of capitalism is reserved for its\nsocial arrangements and not its material accomplishments. He had\nlittle time for what is sometimes called the \u201cromantic critique\nof capitalism\u201d, which sees industry and technology as the real\nvillains, responsible for devastating the purportedly communitarian\nidyll of pre-capitalist relations. In contrast, Marx celebrates the\nbourgeoisie\u2019s destruction of feudal relations, and sees\ntechnological growth and human liberation as (at least, in time)\nprogressing hand-in-hand. Industry and technology are understood as\npart of the solution to, and not the source of, social problems.\n\nThere are many opportunities for scepticism here. In the present\ncontext, many struggle to see how the kind of large-scale industrial\nproduction that would presumably characterise communist\nsociety\u2014communism purportedly being more productive than\ncapitalism\u2014would avoid alienation in work. Interesting responses\nto such concerns have been put forward, but they have typically come\nfrom commentators rather than from Marx himself (Kandiyali 2018). This\nis a point at which Marx\u2019s self-denying ordinance concerning the\ndetailed description of communist society prevents him from engaging\ndirectly with significant concerns about the direction of social\nchange.\n",
