    "main_text": "Aristotle\n6. The Stoics\n\nThe earliest Stoics seem committed to preserving the intuition that\nwhenever we are in a mental state, there is something that\nour mental state is of or about. But they reject the Parmenidean\nrequirement that this must be something \u201cthat is\u201d,\nsomething that exists or obtains. On the contrary, they claim that\n\u201cin the nature of things, some things are and some are\nnot,\u201d since the nature of things includes \u201canything that\ncomes to mind, such as centaurs, giants or anything else made up by a\nfalse thought.\u201d (Seneca Letter 58.15) Accordingly,\nthese Stoics regard Something as the highest genus, rather\nthan What is or What has being, as Plato had.\nWhenever a phantasia or representation is of something which\ndoes not in fact exist, there still is something our representation is\nof, which they call a phantasma, an \u201capparition\u201d\nor \u201cfigment\u201d. Even though it does not exist, on this view\nit is still something and so can serve as the object of our mental\nstate.\n\nThis position does not seem to have to have arisen from idle\nspeculation, but rather as part of a response to Plato. The first two\nheads of the school, Zeno of Citium and Cleanthes of Assos, argue that\nthere are no such things as Plato\u2019s forms. The concept\n(ennoia) of a kind, that is, of a genus or species, is a\nthought of what they call an enno\u0113ma, an object that is\nquite literally \u201cin a thought\u201d (en +\nno\u0113ma), an \u201cimmanent object\u201d, but is found\nonly in thought. The precise nature of these objects is\ncontroversial. According to one source (Stobaeus, 1.136.21 ff.), they\nare \u201cnot something\u201d and so not something\nqualified in a certain way, but only \u201cas if\u201d they were\nsomething and \u201cas if\u201d they were qualified; they are\nfurther said to be only \u201capparitions\u201d or\nphantasmata, something merely represented. On this basis,\nmost interpretations take the Stoics to hold that the objects of these\nthoughts are \u201cnot-somethings\u201d (outina): fictions\nor figments that are so beyond the pale, allegedly, that they do not\neven count as something. But so understood, the Stoic view\nwould be deeply obscure, if not actually incoherent. If the objects of\nthese thoughts are not something, they are not anything, on pain of\ncontradiction. That, after all, was the point of claiming that\nSomething is the highest or most comprehensive genus:\neverything is something. But if there are no such things,\nthen what is gained by replacing Platonic forms with\nenno\u0113mata, rather than simply eliminating Platonic forms\naltogether? Worse, what becomes of the intuition that whenever we have\na representation, there is something that our representation\nis of?\n\nThe earliest Stoics do think they have gained something by this move,\nthough. They appeal, unsurprisingly, to both genera and species in\ncharacterizing the methods of definition and division, which they take\nto be central to logic and reasoning. Far from being a blank nothing,\nthese objects are distinguished from one another in terms of their\ncommon features and differences, as they would have to be for the\nclassificatory system required for dialectic and science. The Stoics,\nmoreover, explicitly quantify over these objects: there is,\nin fact, a distinct object of thought for each number (Plotinus\nEnneads 6.6.12.13\u201329). In referring to them as\n\u201capparitions\u201d (phantasmata), moreover, the Stoics\nare not eliminating them. They are recognizing them as something that\nour mind is directed towards whenever something general\n\u201cappears\u201d to us or is represented (phantasia).\nFor as we have seen, they hold that whatever appears to us is\nsomething, even if it is not something that exists or obtains.\nThe natural move for the Stoics, then, would be to say that while\nPlatonic forms aren\u2019t anything at all \u2013 there are\nno such things \u2013 there are such things as\nenno\u0113mata; they just aren\u2019t anything that\nis, that exists or obtains. And in fact a parallel report in\nDiogenes Laertius can be read in precisely this way: although an\nenno\u0113ma is not anything that exists and so does\nnot possess qualities, it is nevertheless \u201cas if\u201d it were\nsomething that exists and \u201cas if\u201d it possessed\nqualities, \u201clike the impression of a horse when none is\npresent\u201d (Diogenes Laertius VII 61). In such a case, what I\nimagine is something and indeed something horse\u2013like; but it is\nnot a real horse or anything existent, and so on their view not\nsomething that can act or be acted upon and so not a body. It is\nmerely an object of thought.\n\nSuch generic objects will further be incomplete or indeterminate. It\nwill not be true to say that the generic human (genikos\nanthr\u014dpos) is Greek, for example, or equally to say that it\nis not Greek, even in an \u201cas if\u201d sort of way, since some,\nbut not all, humans are Greek (Sextus Empiricus, Adv. math.\nVII 246). A generic object will be \u201cas if\u201d it were\nF if, and only if, all the individuals falling under\nit are F. This claim need not violate the Principle of the\nExcluded Middle, since it would still be true of the generic human\nthat it is either Greek or not Greek, since it is\ntrue that all humans are either Greek or not Greek. But it would\nviolate the Principle of Bivalence, since it still will be neither\ntrue nor false to say that the generic human is Greek. (For further\ndiscussion of enno\u0113mata, see Caston 1999.)\n\nThe third head of the school, Chrysippus of Soli, avoids these\nproblems by appealing instead to \u201cthat which can be said\u201d\nor \u201cmeant\u201d (lekta, lit. \u2018sayables\u2019),\ncertain abstract objects that are signified by our words.\nLekta, like place, void, and time, cannot themselves either\nact or be acted upon, and so in the Stoics\u2019 view cannot be\nbodies, which are the only existents they recognize; all such entities\nare instead classified as \u201cincorporeals\u201d\n(as\u014dmata). But lekta will still be\nsomething, since in each case there is something that our\nwords signify; it is just that they \u201csubsist\u201d\n(huphestanai) rather than exist (einai), as the\nStoics sometimes say. Unlike enno\u0113mata, however, they\nwill not generally be the objects of mental states (except\nperhaps when we are thinking about Stoic semantics, for example). They\nserve rather as the contents of mental states, which can be\narticulated in language, regardless of which objects (if any) these\nstates are directed towards (Sextus Empiricus Adv. math. VIII\n11\u201312, 70, 409; Diogenes Laertius VII 63). There are\nlekta corresponding to general terms and predicates, as well\nas to sentences of all kinds: not only to simple and molecular\npropositions (axi\u014dmata), but also questions, commands,\noaths, suggestions, prayers, and so on (Sextus Empiricus Adv.\nmath. VIII 71\u201373; Diogenes Laertius VII 66\u20138). For\nChrysippus, moreover, a definition like \u2018a human is a rational\nmortal animal\u2019, should not be construed as being about a generic\nobject, even in an \u201cas if\u201d sort of way. Rather it has the\nsame meaning as the universal generalization, \u2018if something is a\nhuman, then that thing is a rational mortal animal\u2019 (Sextus\nEmpiricus Adv. math. XI 8\u201311). But such a proposition\ncommits us to nothing more than the relevant individuals that\nsatisfy it (if indeed there are any) and to the lekta\nsignified by its predicates. Finally, unlike generic objects,\nlekta are not indeterminate. It is simply false to\nclaim that what is expressed by the predicate \u2018is a human\u2019\nis itself a human (and likewise simply true that the predicate\n\u2018is a predicate\u2019 is itself a predicate). Therefore,\nlekta need not pose a threat to the Principle of\nBivalence.\n\nOne of the most tantalizing questions concerns the relationship\nbetween mental representations (phantasiai) and\nlekta. The Stoics effectively endorse a version of\nBrentano\u2019s Thesis that intentionality is the criterion of the\nmental, which demarcates the domain of psychology. The Stoics think\nthat representations are what set animals and humans apart from plants\nand inanimate substances: only things with psuch\u0113 or\nsoul have mental representations (phantasiai) of the world\nand make efforts (hormai) to move and change things (Origen\nOn Principles 3.1.2, 196.12\u2013197.8 Koetschau). But they also\nthink that representations are a pervasive feature of psychological\nphenomena: every mental state either is a representation or involves\none essentially, because it is an assent to a representation as\ncorrect or rejection of it as incorrect or withholding assent from it\naltogether. So representation (phantasia) is a feature of all\nand only mental states. Lekta constitute the content of these\nrepresentations. The Stoics in fact define them as \u201cwhat subsists in\ncorrespondence with a rational representation,\u201d where a rational\nrepresentation is one that belongs to rational animals like ourselves\n(Diogenes Laertius VII 63; Sextus Empiricus Adv. math. VII\n51).\n\nThis definition, though, also poses a difficulty. In recent decades,\nit has been thought to imply that lekta subsist only\nin connection with the representations of rational animals \u2013\nsomething not stated explicitly in our reports \u2013 even though\nthis would have problematic consequences: it would imply that\nnonrational animals and indeed very young humans, before they develop\nreason, would either paradoxically have representations without any\ncontent at all or solely with nonconceptual content that could not be\narticulated. (For a classic statement of the view, see Frede 1983\n[1987], 153\u201354, 156; for a discussion of the consequences, see\nSorabji 1993, 20\u201328.) Neither the Stoics nor their critics ever\nmention such consequences, and it would make it difficult, if not\nimpossible, for them to account for animal behavior, much less the\nemergence of reason itself in humans. They insist that we have no\nconcepts (ennoiai) at birth, comparing the mind to a blank\nsheet of papyrus, ready to be written upon: it is first inscribed by\nperceptions and then subsequently, through the sorting and collection\nof perceptual memories, by experience, issuing in our first natural\nconcepts, from which we can later construct even more complex\nconcepts. Reason only appears later \u2013 some sources say at age\nseven, others at fourteen \u2013 when there are sufficient concepts\nto form a stable, interrelated system (Aetius 4.11.1\u20134; Plutarch\nOn Common Conceptions 1084f\u20131085a;\nDiogenes\nLaertius VII 53). So on the Stoics\u2019 view, children will possess\nconcepts at some stage before they have reason, since reason\nemerges from the cumulative acquisition and systematization of\nconcepts, and evidently some of these concepts are formed naturally\nfrom perceptions and memories alone, unaided by reason, from which\nthey presumably derive their content at least in part. Since all these\nstates undoubtedly possess content, there is no principled ground for\ndenying analogous content in the case of representations in\nnonrational animals either, at least for perceptual\nrepresentations.\n\nIf lekta serve here, as elsewhere, as the content of these\nstates, then lekta will not correspond solely to\nrational representations. But how, one might reasonably ask, can the\nrepresenations in nonrational animals and very young humans, who are\nwithout concepts and incapable of articulate speech, have\nlekta corresponding to them? There is a widespread assumption\nin the secondary literature that whether a lekton corresponds\nto a representation depends upon which concepts (if any) an individual\npossesses. But the Stoics cannot accept this assumption. Quite the\ncontrary. They believe that a lekton is involved in\nevery causal interaction, whether animate or inanimate: one\nbody causes a lekton to become true or hold of another body,\nwhere the lekton specifies the fully determinate effect of\nthe agent on the patient (Stobaeus 1.138.14; Sextus Empiricus Adv.\nmath. 9.211; Clement of Alexandria Stromata\n8.9.3\u20134; this point is rightly emphasized by Frede 1994). But\nthis analysis of causation immediately becomes pertinent once we\nacknowledge that the Stoics also hold a causal theory of\nrepresentation: they define representations as the effect \u2013\nliterally, an \u201cimpression\u201d (tup\u014dsis) \u2013\nthat in the paradigmatic case the object of representation produces on\nthe soul (which on their view is a body); and they expressly compare\nthis to the impression a signet ring makes in wax (Diogenes Laertius\nVII 50; Aetius 4.12.1\u20134; Plutarch On Common Conceptions\n1084f\u20131085a),\nand they appeal to sigillary language again when they define the\n\u201csecure\u201d representation they regard as the criterion of\ntruth and foundation of knowledge (phantasia\nkatal\u0113ptik\u0113), which represents the object that produces\nit in such rich detail that it could be distinguished from anything\nelse, no matter how similar (Cicero Acad. 2.77\u201378; Sextus\nEmpiricus Adv. math. 7.248 ff.; Diogenes Laertius VII\n46).\n\nWhenever an object produces a representation, then, there will be a\ncorresponding lekton that specifies the object\u2019s fully\ndeterminate effect on the soul: not only that it is a representation\nand a representation of a certain sort, but one that represents\nobjects in the world as having various features and standing in\nvarious relations, potentially in extraordinarily rich detail.\nEmbedded within this complex lekton will be a clause that\nexhaustively expresses the content: if all such lekta can be\ncaptured with the schema, \u2018\u2026 forms a representation\nthat \u2013\u2019, whatever fills the second blank will express\nthe total content of the representation. None of this requires concept\npossession or even conceptual abilities: which lekton belongs\nto a representation is determined causally by the interaction of a\nspecific object and a specific subject in certain conditions, so long\nas the subject is capable of forming a representation when affected by\nappropriate objects in the right way. Perceptual representations even\nin nonrational animals will ordinarily have tremendously detailed\ncontents, which cannot be exhaustively expressed by a simple\nproposition, as part of the corresponding lekton. Humans can\ngo further than nonrational animals, though, through their ability to\nfocus selectively on individual parts of such content and respond\ndifferentially, assenting to some, rejecting others, and withholding\nassent on still others. This ability to consider isolated contents is\nwhat allows rational animals to entertain abstract representations,\nwhose total content can be expressed by a simple proposition;\nor indeed to entertain any content formed by logical operations upon\nthese (possibly recursively). It is therefore only by reference to the\ncontents of rational representations that we are able to capture the\nfull domain of lekta, much as the definition in Diogenes\nLaertius and Sextus Empiricus suggests, so as to include abstract as\nwell as perceptual representations. But this does not exclude\nnonrational animals from also having lekta corresponding to\ntheir representations, thus making intentional explanations of their\nbehavior possible and psychology more generally. (For more on Stoic\nrepresentations and a fuller defense of the interpretation above, see\nCaston forthcoming.)\n",
