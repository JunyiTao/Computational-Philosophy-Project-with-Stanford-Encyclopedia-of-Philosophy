    "main_text": "The Neo-Confucian Era || Final Thoughts\n5. The Modern Era\n\nThe last years of the Qing dynasty, which collapsed in 1911, were\nmarked by a flourishing of political thought under the twin stimuli of\ndomestic challenges and encounters with foreign political\nphilosophies. The Russian Revolution of 1917 added further fuel to the\nfire, at a time when the nascent Republic of China was struggling with\nboth internal and external threats. The nature and sources of\npolitical authority once again were topics of debate. Many now took it\nfor granted that the goal was some sort of \u201cdemocracy\u201d in\nwhich the people were (at least in principle) sovereign. But who\ncounted as \u201cthe people\u201d, how they were to be led or\nrepresented, and how collective versus individual goals were to be\nbalanced all were up for grabs. At a broader level, there was a debate\nbetween those who felt the answer lay in one or another\n\u201cism\u201d\u2014that is, an all-encompassing ideology like\nMarxism\u2014and those who favored working more pragmatically, via\ninstitution building, on one \u201cproblem\u201d at a time. A few\ndecades later, after the founding of the People\u2019s Republic,\nsimilar issues were addressed in the contrast between\n\u201cRed\u201d (ideologically and morally pure) and\n\u201cexpert\u201d (possessing technical expertise). In various\nways, these twentieth-century debates resonated with classical and\nNeo-Confucian contention between insitutional and character-centered\ntheories of governance. Were morally advanced individuals the key to\nan ideal society? Or should objective standards of success, coupled\nwith objective institutions, be society\u2019s political foundation?\nIn cases of conflict, which had priority?\n\nThere was certainly no single answer offered to these questions by any\nof the groups making up twentieth-century China\u2019s political\nlandscape, ranging from \u201cNew Confucians\u201d to nationalists\nto liberals to Marxists. However, the \u201cisms\u201d approach won\nout through much of the century, and Thomas Metzger has shown that\nChinese political thinkers of all camps tended toward what he calls\n\u201cepistemological optimism\u201d, which is a confidence that the\none, universally applicable moral and political truth is knowable, and\nso great authority should be vested in those gifted individuals able\nto perceive this truth (Metzger 2005). Another way to put this would\nbe to say that there is a strong Utopian strand in much\ntwentieth-century Chinese political thought, which has both pushed\ntoward radical solutions and led to dissatisfaction with continued\ndissonance or piecemeal progress. Even Chinese liberals have, in many\ncases, envisioned harmonious societies in which individual\nself-realization goes hand-in-hand with the realization the larger\ncollectivity, which they often called the \u201clarger self\n(dawo)\u201d (Zarrow 2021).\n\nSome philosophers in the twentieth century have been more aware than\nothers of the problems with Utopianism. Mou Zongsan (1909\u20131995),\na leader of the new Confucian movement, was not only aware of it, but\nalso offered a particularly creative way out of the recurrent tension\nbetween personal virtue (or morality) and public standards (or\npolitics). Mou\u2019s insight is that the relation between morality\nand politics is \u201cdialectical\u201d. Rather than seeing a\nleader\u2019s political virtue as a direct extension of his or her\npersonal, moral virtue, Mou argues that there needs to be an indirect\nrelation between them. Politics and political virtue must develop out\nof morality, but nonetheless have an independent, objective existence.\nThis means that human rights, for example, must have a basis in\nmorality, but come to be measured by standards that are separate from\nmoral standards. The converse is also true: full moral virtue requires\nthat which partly \u201crestricts itself (ziwo\nkanxian)\u201d, namely objective structure (Mou 1991: 59).\nObjective structures (like laws) are fundamentally different from the\nsubjectively-felt, internalized morality after which we should all\nindividually strive. The concrete implication of this is that no\nmatter what one\u2019s level of moral accomplishment,\n\n\ninsofar as one\u2019s virtue is manifested in politics, one cannot\noverride the relevant limits (that is, the highest principles of the\npolitical world), and in fact must devote one\u2019s august character\nto the realization of these limits. (Mou 1991: 128)\n\n\nIn short, sages cannot break the law or violate the constitution.\nPolitics thus has its independence from morality.\n\nPhilosophers have differed in their evaluations of Mou\u2019s\nargument, but it can stand as an instance of the continuing creativity\nto be found in contemporary Chinese political thinking (Angle 2012).\nChina\u2019s dynamic society offers a crucible within which new ideas\nand new political forms may be forged and tested in coming years. To\nbe sure, genuinely novel and intellectually challenging ideas do not\nform the majority of contemporary Chinese political discourse, but\nthey are nonetheless present across the entire political spectrum. It\nremains to be seen whether robust political values and institutions\nwill emerge as alternatives to models with which Western political\ntheorists are familiar, just as we cannot yet foresee what role the\nMarxist, Confucian, liberal, and other traditions will play in future\nChinese political thinking. Concerns with harmony and virtue are\nunlikely to disappear, but (as Mou\u2019s example shows) this by no\nmeans limits the future interest of whatever political institutions\nand theories emerge in China.\n",
