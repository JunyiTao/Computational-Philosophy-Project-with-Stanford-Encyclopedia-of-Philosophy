    "main_text": "Determinacy and Large Cardinals || Determinacy\n3.1  Determinacy\n\nFor a set of reals A \u2286 \u03c9\u03c9\nconsider the game where two players take turns playing natural\nnumbers: \n\nI  x(0)   x(2)  x(4) \u2026\nII   x(1)  x(3) \u2026\n\n\n At the end of a round of this game the two players will have\nproduced a real x, obtained through \u201cinterleaving\u201d\ntheir plays. We say that Player I wins the round if x\n\u2208 A; otherwise Player II wins the round. The set A\nis said to be determined if one of the players has a\n\u201cwinning strategy\u201d in the associated game, that is, a\nstrategy which ensures that the player wins a round regardless of how\nthe other player plays. The Axiom of Determinacy (AD) is the\nstatement that every set of reals is determined. This axiom\nwas introduced by Mycielski and Steinhaus in 1962. \n\n It is straightforward to see that very simple sets are\ndetermined. For example, if A is the set of all reals then\nclearly I has a winning strategy; if A is empty then clearly II\nhas a winning strategy; and if A is countable then II has a\nwinning strategy (by \u201cdiagonalizing\u201d). This might lead one\nto expect that all sets of reals are determined. However, it\nis straightforward to use the Axiom of Choice (AC) to construct a\nnon-determined set (by listing all winning strategies and\n\u201cdiagonalizing\u201d across them). For this reason AD was never\nreally considered as a serious candidate for a new axiom. However,\nthere is an interesting class of related axioms that are consistent\nwith AC, namely, the axioms of definable determinacy. These\naxioms extend the above pattern by asserting that all sets of reals at\na given level of complexity are determined, notable examples\nbeing \u0394\u033011-determinacy\n(all Borel sets of reals are determined), PD (all projective sets of\nreals are determined) and ADL(\u211d) (all sets of\nreals in L(\u211d) are determined). \n\n One issue is whether these are really new axioms or whether they\nfollow from ZFC. One of the earliest results in the subject (due to\nGale and Stewart in 1953) is that (in ZFC)\nall \u03a0\u033001\n(that is, closed) games are determined. This result was extended to\nthe next few levels of the Borel hierarchy. Finally, in 1974, Martin\nproved the landmark result\nthat \u0394\u033011-determinacy\nis provable in ZFC. It turns out that this result is close to\noptimal\u2014as one climbs the hierarchy of definability, shortly\nafter \u0394\u033011\none arrives at axioms that fall outside the provenance of ZFC. For\nexample, this is true\nof \u03a0\u033011-determinacy,\nPD and ADL(\u211d). Thus, we have here a hierarchy\nof axioms (including PD and ADL(\u211d)) which are\ngenuine candidates for new axioms. \n\n For a pointclass \u0393 of (k-tuples of) sets of reals,\nlet Det(\u0393) be the statement that all sets of reals in \u0393\nare determined. In what follows we shall assume that \u0393 has\ncertain minimal closure properties; more precisely, we shall assume\nthat \u0393 is an adequate pointclass in the sense of\nMoschovakis (1980). The precise details of this notion are not\nimportant for our purposes; suffice it to say that all of the\npointclasses introduced thus far are adequate. \n\n Theorem 3.1 (Banach, Mazur, Oxtoby 1957). Assume ZFC + Det(\u0393). Then the sets of reals in \u0393 have the property of Baire. \n\n\n Theorem 3.2 (Mycielski-Swierczkowski 1964). Assume ZFC + Det(\u0393). Then the sets of reals in \u0393 are Lebesgue measurable. \n\n\n Theorem 3.3 (Davis 1964). Assume ZFC + Det(\u0393). Then the sets in \u0393 have the perfect set property. \n\n\n In particular, if one assumes PD then all projective sets of reals\nhave the regularity properties and if one assumes\nADL(\u211d) then all of the sets of reals\nin L(\u211d) have the regularity properties. \n\n In fact by modifying the above proofs one can obtain the\nregularity properties for a larger pointclass, namely,\n\u2203\u211d\u0393. This is the pointclass obtained by\ntaking projections of sets in \u0393. So, for example, if \u0393\nis \u0394\u033011\nthen \u2203\u211d\u0393\nis \u03a3\u033011. It\nfollows that\nassuming \u0394\u033011-determinacy\n(which is provable in ZFC) one gets that\nthe \u03a3\u033011\nsets of reals have the regularity properties (see the exercises in 6.G\nof Moschovakis (1980)). In this sense determinacy lies at the heart of\nthe regularity properties and may be considered their true\nsource. \n\n The above results show that axioms of definable determinacy extend\nthe results on regularity properties that can be proved in ZFC. ZFC\ncan establish that\nall \u03a3\u033011\nsets of reals have the regularity properties\nand \u0394\u033011-determinacy\n(a theorem of ZFC) lies at the heart of this result. The extension\nof \u0394\u033011-determinacy\nto stronger forms of definable determinacy (PD,\nADL(\u211d), etc.) generalizes these results by\nextending the regularity properties to the corresponding pointclasses\n(projective, in L(\u211d), etc.) \n\n In a similar fashion, axioms of definable determinacy extend the\nresults on the uniformization property. \n\n Theorem 3.4 (Moschovakis 1971). Assume ZFC + Det(\u0394\u033012n). Then Unif(\u03a0\u033012n+1) and Unif(\u03a3\u033012n+2).  \n\n\nThus, under PD the uniformization property has the following\npattern: \n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Uniformization under PD.\n\n\n This pattern recurs at higher levels under stronger forms of\ndeterminacy. For example, under ADL(\u211d) the\npattern recurs throughout the transfinite extension of the projective\nsets within L(\u211d). For all of L(\u211d) one\nhas: \n\n Theorem 3.5 (Martin-Steel 1983). Assume ZFC +ADL(\u211d). Then in L(\u211d),  \u03a3\u033021 has the uniformization property. \n\n\n(Here \u03a3\u033021\nis defined just as (the logical version)\nof \u03a3\u033011\nexcept that now the initial quantifier ranges over sets of reals and\nnot just reals (as is indicated by the superscript).)  \n\n Moreover, the uniformization property is not an isolated case. The\nsame pattern holds for other properties, such as the prewellordering\nproperty and the scale property. \n",
