    "main_text": "Twentieth Century || Marxist Approaches: Adorno and Bloch\n2.6 Analytic Philosophy of Music\n\nAnalytic approaches are presented in detail in the entry on\n the philosophy of music\n (for a book-length introduction, see Kania 2020). Here I shall focus\non two representative debates and indicate some general trends.\n\nAnalytic philosophy of music is at times regarded as exclusively\ncentered on linguistic and conceptual analysis, and dismissed on the\ngrounds of this narrow focus (see for instance Lippman 1992: 353). But\nthis picture is only faithful to its first stages of development.\nAnalytic philosophy of music has evolved, hybridized, and fragmented,\nmuch like analytic philosophy at large. In fact, contemporary analytic\nwork on music often includes sustained discussion of scientific or\nhistorical research (see for instance Robinson 2005, Nussbaum 2007,\nDyck 2014). A different feature is perhaps distinctive of the analytic\napproach, namely its systematic and often tacitly assumed veto on\nvalue judgments regarding the works, traditions, styles, etc. under\ninvestigation. Artistic value is not discovered or ascertained through\nphilosophical speculation, it is merely accounted for. This is in\nquite striking contrast with the approach of many other figures\ndiscussed in this entry, who first developed philosophical theories,\nand then on that basis produced sweeping dismissals of music that is\nwidely regarded as valuable\u2014think of Rousseau on French music or\nAdorno on jazz (on the differences between analytic and continental\nphilosophy of music, see Roholt 2017).\n\nThe systematic development of musical ontology is perhaps the most\ncharacteristic thematic focus of analytic philosophy, as the area had\nbeen almost entirely neglected by previous philosophical theories. The\nmost popular ontological views are type theories, according to which\nmusical works are repeatable entities, tokened by multiple sound\nevents. Some type theorists are Platonists. They hold that musical\nworks are abstract objects that do not come into existence (Kivy\n1983a, 1983b; Dodd 2007). A different approach holds that musical\nworks are created types, a feature that proponents argue makes sense\nof music as a human, contingent practice (Levinson 1980).\n\nAgainst Platonism, nominalist theories reject types and construe\nmusical works as collections of particulars (Goodman 1968; Predelli\n2001; Caplan & Matheson 2006). A less popular option is to\nconsider musical works as actions. Gregory Currie (1989) and David\nDavies (2004) have defended such a view with respect to artworks in\ngeneral, including musical ones. It has also been proposed that\nmusical works are best regarded as useful fictions that sustain our\ncritical and appreciative discourse about music (Kania 2008; Killin\n2018; for a recent overview of analytic ontology of music, see S.\nDavies 2020).\n\nRecent work has tackled meta-ontological questions, asking what\nprinciples should guide the construction of ontological theories (see\nfor instance Stecker 2009; Dodd 2013; D. Davies 2017). A useful\ndistinction is the one between descriptive and revisionary ontologies\n(Kania 2008), the former adhering to pre-theoretical conceptions of\nwhat a musical works is, the latter sacrificing intuitions for the\nsake of theoretical virtues.\n\nThough she ultimately rejects analytic approaches to the ontology of\nmusic, it is worth mentioning here Lydia Goehr\u2019s The\nImaginary Museum of Musical Works (1992), an extraordinarily\ninfluential study on the origin of the concept of musical work. Goehr\nargues that this concept emerged relatively recently in Western music\nhistory.\n\nAlong with ontology, musical expressiveness is probably the most\nfrequently discussed issue in analytic philosophy of music (for an\nintroduction to the debate, see Matravers 2007). An important advance\nin this area is represented by the distinction between the emotions\nmusic expresses and those it is expressive of (Kivy\n1989, elaborating on Tormey 1971). The saggy features of a Saint\nBernard dog make it look sad, but they do not stand in a causal\nrelation with a psychological state of sadness. The dog\u2019s face\nis expressive of sadness, but does not express sadness. Likewise,\nsadness is attributed to music regardless of whether it is the\nexpression of sadness or of any other emotion\u2014that\nMozart\u2019s Requiem Mass in D minor is expressive of\nanguish is something we can determine independently from the anguished\nstate its author may have found himself in when composing it. The\nemotions the music is expressive of are also conceptually distinct\nfrom those it may arouse in the listener\u2014the Requiem\nmay arouse anguish in me, but it would be an anguished work even if it\ndidn\u2019t. As intuitive as these distinctions may appear, previous\naccounts of the relationship between music and emotions did not trace\nthem explicitly, and at times seem to move from one notion to the\nother.\n\nWe thus have (1) the emotions a composer may have felt when writing\nthe piece (2) the emotions music may arouse in the listener, and (3)\nthe emotion we attribute to the music itself. Accounts of\nexpressiveness that construe it as dependent on (1) or (2) are named,\nrespectively, arousal and expression theories. Both approaches are\ngenerally considered as discredited, although a sophisticated version\nof the arousal theory has been defended by Derek Matravers (1998), and\na qualified defense of the expression theory has been advanced by\nJenefer Robinson (2005). Accounts of expressiveness that regard it as\nindependent from (1) and (2) need to explain why we use emotion words\nto describe a non-sentient object. Resemblance theories of musical\nexpressiveness argue that this is because of a perceived similarity\nbetween the music and the characteristic vocal and behavioral human\nexpressions of emotions (S. Davies 1980, 1994; Kivy 1989). Appeal to\nsuch resemblance in accounting for musical expressiveness is as old as\nphilosophy of music itself, but the careful separation of the emotions\nin the music from those aroused in the listener distinguishes these\nviews from virtually all their predecessors. The same distinction\nallows Peter Kivy (1934\u20132017) to develop a formalist view of\nmusical appreciation that recognizes the role of expressive properties\nbut unties them from the emotions aroused by music (Kivy 1990a).\nJenefer Robinson (2005) has developed a sophisticated hybrid theory of\nexpressiveness, arguing that the music\u2019s arousal of emotions at\nthe sub-personal level is partly responsible for the resemblances we\nperceive in the music.\n\nAn alternative way to flesh out the view of musical emotions as\nproperties of the music itself is the so-called persona\ntheory of expressiveness, according to which expressive music is\nexperienced as the emotional expression of a fictional persona\n(Levinson 2006). This proposal sidesteps the problems generated by the\npuzzling description of a non-sentient being in emotional terms, by\npositing that music is the emotional expression of a fictional\nindividual.\n\nAnalytic philosophy has so far manifested relatively little interest\nin matters of musical value and music\u2019s connection with moral,\nsocial, and political issues. Roger Scruton (1944\u20132020) deserves\nmention in this connection. His work shares with analytic philosophy\nsome broad thematic areas of interest, but generally defies\ncategorization. The sustained discussion of matters such as the\nsocio-cultural dimension of music and musical value sets his\nhumanistic approach apart from much other philosophical writing on\nmusic in the Anglophone world (see particularly Scruton 1997).\n",
