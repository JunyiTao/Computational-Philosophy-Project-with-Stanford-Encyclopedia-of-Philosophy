    "main_text": "Philosophy of Race || Political Conceptions of Race\n6.2 Political Conceptions of Race\n\nPolitical conceptions of race reject two basic assumptions of\nscientific theories, they reject that races are distinct biologically\ndetermined populations, and secondarily reject that biological\ndifferences of race account for cultural variation, or establish the\nrelative inferiority or superiority of putative race groups. Political\nconceptions of race contend that racism is constitutive of races.\nRacial groups result from political, economic, and social mechanisms\nthat create relative group advantage or disadvantage. Racial\ndifferentiation and hierarchy are the consequences of group exercise\nof political power.\n\nPolitical race, for Locke, is merely favorable or unfavorable social\ninheritance masquerading as genetic ethnic inheritance. Racial\ndifferences and inequalities are caused by these factors, and so, will\nnot account for the duration or amelioration of inequalities and\ndifferentiations. The permanence of racial groups, if it is to be\npromoted, must be based on something other than metaphysical realist\nnotions of race. Conversely, if racial inequalities are to be\neradicated, that too will likely require attention to, and control of,\nfactors and elements of putatively racial groups other than their\nsupposed biological or anthropological similarity.\n\nCharacteristically racial modes of living are wrongly regarded as\nbiologically, rather than, socially inherited. This social inheritance\ncan be either favorable or unfavorable. Locke observes that cultures\nare often racially diverse. Multiple races may share some larger\ncultural elements. (Locke, 1989, 193\u201394) Races are regarded as\n\u201cconcrete culture-types,\u201d according to Locke, which are\n\u201ccomposite racially speaking, and have only an artificial ethnic\nunity, of historical derivation and manufacture.\u201d (Locke, 1989,\n194) Race is a learned epistemic mode of being. A sense of race\nmembership is enculturated and socialized, and once acquired, the race\nsense partly conditions how one perceives and understands the\nworld.\n",
