    "main_text": "Art as Experience || Aesthetic Form\n2.4 Aesthetic Form\n\nAs internalist as Dewey\u2019s approach to aesthetic experience is,\nand as much as he emphasizes the distinction between an art product as\na physical thing and the artwork as an experienced thing, Dewey also\npresents a detailed examination of the formal features of aesthetic\nobjects similar to those carried out by numerous other philosophers of\nart. Dewey states that aesthetic experience has \u201cobjective\nconditions\u201d (AE: 68): not all objects and environments\ninspire the kind of interaction that he thinks constitutes an\naesthetic experience. His analysis of \u201caesthetic form\u201d is\nan attempt to capture these conditions. Similarly to his understanding\nof aesthetic experience as dynamic and developing rather than as a\nclear-cut sense perception, Dewey seeks to bring out the livelier\nsides of form. Aesthetic form is something that \u201cenhance[s],\nprolong[s] and purif[ies] perceptual experience\u201d (EN:\n292).\n\nOn a basic level, by form Dewey means the thing that \u201corganizes\nmaterial into the matter of art\u201d (AE: 139). Form is\nconstituted by the different parts of the aesthetic object and by\ntheir relationships to one another. For Dewey, the parts of aesthetic\nform are not independent units. Rather, relationship is\n\u201csomething direct and active\u2026 dynamic and\nenergetic\u201d (AE: 139). With his conception of form,\nDewey draws attention to \n\n\nthe way things bear upon one another, their clashes and unitings, the\nway they fulfill and frustrate, promote and retard, excite and inhibit\none another. (AE: 139) \n\n\nIn the case of aesthetic form, the different parts of the object must\nadjust themselves as parts of the same object. The individual parts\nhave a functional and active role in the whole of which they are a\npart.\n\nThis also means that perception of aesthetic form is not a matter of\nunrelated singular perceptions, but it is \u201cserial\u201d, in\nthat \u201ceach sequential act builds up and reinforces what went\nbefore\u201d (AE: 136). According to Dewey, aesthetic form\npossess \u201cqualitative unity\u201d which can be immediately felt.\nA fuller aesthetic experience, nevertheless, requires engaging with\nthe form\u2019s organization precisely in the sense of serial\nperception. (AE: 141) Against this background, Dewey calls\ninto question the traditional distinction between the arts of time\n(music, theater, dance) and the arts of space (painting, sculpture,\narchitecture). Even the spatial arts include important temporal\ndimensions and have to be \u201cperceived by accumulative series of\ninteractions\u201d (AE: 223). Through this sort of serial\nand cumulating engagement the aesthetic object gradually builds up for\nthe experiencer. This, according to Dewey, is especially the case with\nthe supposedly static art of architecture:\n\n\n[Even] a small hut cannot be the matter of esthetic perception save as\ntemporal qualities enter in. A cathedral\u2026 makes an\ninstantaneous impression\u2026 But this is only the substratum and\nframework within which a continuous process of interactions introduces\nenriching and defining elements\u2026 One must move about, within\nand without, and through repeated visits let the structure gradually\nyield itself\u2026 in various lights and in connection with changing\nmoods. (AE: 224)\n\n\nIf aesthetic experience has objective conditions, aesthetic form, in\nturn, has a set of \u201cformal conditions\u201d, which are\n\u201ccontinuity, cumulation, conservation, tension and\nanticipation\u201d (AE: 143). Dewey draws special attention\nto the factor of resistance. It is a kind of condition of conditions,\nfor \u201cwithout internal tension\u201d experience of form would be\njust \u201ca fluid rush to a straightaway mark\u201d in which case\nthere \u201ccould be [nothing] called development and\nfulfillment\u201d (AE: 143). Dewey further specifies the\nrelationship between aesthetic form and aesthetic experience:\n\n\n[T]here can be no esthetic experience apart from an object\u2026 for\nan object to be the content of esthetic appreciation it must\nsatisfy those objective conditions without which cumulation,\nconservation, reenforcement, transition into something more complete,\nare impossible. (AE: 151, italics in the original)\n\n\nThe naturalist underpinnings of Dewey\u2019s aesthetics are apparent\nalso in his analysis of aesthetic form, for its conditions are\nobjective precisely in the sense that they belong \u201cto the world\nof physical materials and energies\u201d (AE: 151). His\nnaturalism, thereby, locates the origins of aesthetic form \u201cdeep\nin the world itself\u201d (AE: 152).\n\nOne of these deep conditions of aesthetic form is rhythm. Dewey finds\nrhythm \u201cthe first characteristic of the environing world that\nmakes possible the existence of artistic form\u201d (AE:\n147). The rhythms of art are grounded in the basic patterns of the\nrelation of the live creature and its environment. Dewey opposes the\ntheory of rhythm as the steady recurrence of identical elements as in\na ticking clock: \u201cthe tick-tock theory\u201d of rhythm\n(AE: 168). Rather, each rhythmic beat or tick does not merely\nrepeat the past but drives the rhythmic process forward. Various\nnatural phenomena exemplify this type of rhythm, including \u201ca\npond moving in ripples, forked lightning [and] the waving of branches\nin the wind\u201d (AE: 159). These are contrasted to\nrhythmless phenomena, such as \u201ca monotonous roar\u201d\n(AE: 159), which do not involve mutually resisting forces and\nthus do not entail a gathering up of energy which would create an\nanticipation of release, as in the case of the beating of a\nbird\u2019s wing. Neither do these wholes possess the kind of\naccumulation that Dewey finds essential to aesthetic form.\n\nWhat this all means is that the recurrence typical to aesthetic form\nshould not be understood \u201cstatistically\u201d or\n\u201canatomically\u201d, but functionally. In the case of aesthetic\nform, rhythm is something that furthers experience (AE: 171).\nThe beating of a bird\u2019s wing is a good example: it marks the\nrelease of energy, but at the same time the beginning of a new\naccumulation of energy, which again discharges in a new beating of the\nwing and so on. Dewey finds this form of rhythm \n\n\nwhenever each step forward is at the same time a summing up and\nfulfillment of what precedes, and every consummation carries\nexpectation tensely forward. (AE: 177) \n\n\nWhile Dewey admits that rhythm can be most easily associated with\nmusic, he thinks it, in the end, cuts across the arts, to embrace even\npainting and architecture: \n\n\ndenial of rhythm to pictures, edifices, and statues, or the assertion\nthat it is found in them only metaphorically, rests upon ignorance of\nthe inherent nature of every perception. (AE: 180) \n\n\nAgain, the distinction between the spatial and the temporal arts turns\nout overly strict. Perception of rhythm in pictures is as essential to\ntheir experience as it is to the experience of music.\n",
