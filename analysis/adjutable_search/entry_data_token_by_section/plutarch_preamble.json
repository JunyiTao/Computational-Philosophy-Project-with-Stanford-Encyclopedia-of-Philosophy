    "main_text": "\n\n\nPlutarch of Chaeronea in Boeotia (ca. 45\u2013120 CE) was a\nPlatonist philosopher, best known to the general public as author of\nhis \u201cParallel Lives\u201d of paired Greek and Roman statesmen\nand military leaders. He was a voluminous writer, author also of a\ncollection of \u201cMoralia\u201d or \u201cEthical Essays,\u201d\nmostly in dialogue format, many of them devoted to philosophical\ntopics, not at all limited to ethics.\n\n\nPlutarch's significance as a philosopher, on which this article\nconcentrates, lies in his attempt to do justice to Plato's work as a\nwhole, and to create a coherent and credible philosophical system out\nof it, as Plotinus will also do later (204\u2013270 CE). Two moves\nare crucial in this regard. First, Plutarch respects both the\nskeptical/aporetic element in Plato (as marked by the tentativeness\nwith which Socrates and the other main speakers in his dialogues\nregularly advance their views) and the views apparently endorsed by\nthe main speakers of the dialogues, which were widely regarded as\nPlato's own doctrines (e.g. Diogenes Laertius 3.51\u20132). Second,\nPlutarch focuses primarily and quite strongly on the Timaeus\nfor his understanding of Plato's \u201cdoctrines,\u201d and his\ninterpretation of this dialogue shapes his understanding of the entire\nPlato. Plutarch maintains a literal interpretation of the\nTimaeus, according to which the world has come about in time\nfrom two principles, the creator god and the \u201cIndefinite\nDyad\u201d. While the Dyad accounts for disorder and multiplicity,\nsuch as that of disordered matter before the creation of the ordered\nphysical world, of which pre-cosmic stage Timaeus appears to speak in\nthe Timaeus, god accounts for order and the nature and\nidentity of objects and properties in the world.\nThis metaphysical dualism is further strengthened by the assumption\nof two mediating entities through which the two principles operate;\nthe Indefinite Dyad operates through a non-rational cosmic soul, while\ngod through a rational one. This is the same soul, which becomes\nrational when god imparts reason from himself to it. As a result of\ngod's imparting reason to the world soul, matter ceases to move in a\ndisorderly manner, being brought into order through the imposition of\nForms on it. The postulation of a non-rational pre-cosmic world soul,\ninspired mainly by Laws X (but absent from the\nTimaeus), allows Plutarch to dissolve the apparent\ncontradiction in different works of Plato that the soul is said to be\nboth uncreated (eternal) and created. For in his view the first soul\nof the sensible world, the world soul, is created only in the sense\nthat god, the demiurge of the Timaeus, makes it rational. The\npostulation of a non-rational pre-cosmic soul also allows Plutarch to\naccount for the existence of badness in the world, because in his view\nresidual irrationality abides in the world soul even when it becomes\nrational, which is accounted for by the fact that the world soul is\noriginally non-rational in the sense that its movement is such,\ni.e. disorderly, and reason is an element external to it.\n This dualism (non-rational-disorderly-bad\nvs. rational-orderly-good) pervades also the sensible or physical\nworld, since the human soul, being derivative from the world soul, has\na rational and a non-rational aspect too, as the Republic\nproposes. In this spirit Plutarch distinguishes both in the world and\nin human beings three aspects, body, soul, and intellect. The soul's\nconcern with the body gives rise to the non-rational aspect, which\namounts to disorder, vice, or badness, while the co-operation between\nsoul and intellect promotes rationality, that is, order, virtue,\nbenevolence. In an attempt to accommodate the diverse strands of\nethical thought in Plato (e.g. in the Gorgias,\nProtagoras, Republic, Phaedo,\nTheaetetus, Timaeus), Plutarch is the first\nPlatonist to distinguish different levels of ethical life, which we\ncould term political and theoretical respectively, depending on\nwhether virtue pertains to the soul as organizing principle for one's\ndaily life, or to the intellect as one's guide to knowledge of the\nForms (which include virtues) and of the intelligible realm more\ngenerally.\n",
