    "main_text": "Envy and Justice || Envy-free allocations\n3.2 Envy-free allocations\n\nA different way in which envy might be thought to motivate broadly\negalitarian thought is by appeal to the idea of envy-free allocations.\nA distribution of goods is said to be \u201cenvy-free\u201d when no\none prefers anyone else\u2019s bundle of resources to her\n own.[24]\n The suggestion here is not that envy is the psychological motivation\nfor the concern with equality, but rather that, where a distribution\nin fact produces envy, this is grounds to doubt the fairness of the\ndistribution. But \u2018envy\u2019 in these contexts is a technical\nterm for any situation in which someone prefers another\u2019s bundles of\ngoods, and does not refer to the emotional syndrome with which this\nentry is\n concerned.[25]\n",
