The Divine Word as Principle and Mediator\n\nEckhart\u2019s reversible doctrine of analogy, when taken together\nwith the in quantum principle, allows him to characterize God\nin ways that alternately give Being, Intellect, and Unity conceptual\nprimacy among the transcendentals, and there is some controversy over\nwhich divine attribute, if any, he ultimately took to be most\nfundamental. Of course, Eckhart himself might have countered that such\na question posed simpliciter and without qualification is\njust another instance of trying to say what cannot be said. In any\ncase, it does not seem wrong to characterize Eckhart\u2019s\nmetaphysics as heavily intellectualist, even where he centers Being or\nUnity (or occasionally even Goodness). At the same time, it is an\nintellectualism centered not only on thinking or\ncognition but also crucially on speech and the\ncommunication of being\u2014in the case of God, through an\nsingular, eternal, self-communicating speech-act.\n\nIndeed, for Eckhart, \u201cbeing\u201d just is acting in\nthe sense of communicating something intelligible: \u201cTo exist is\nto communicate\u201d (Dobie 2010: 32). This is exemplified most\nperfectly in God, whose \u201cinner boiling\u201d is characterized\nby its wholly self-sufficient intellectual activity, in which the\nFather \u201cspeaks\u201d (and thereby generates) the Son, and the\nFather and the Son together \u201cbreathe\u201d out the Holy Spirit\nin their bond of divine love. As Eckhart formulates it in his analysis\nof John 1:1 (\u201cIn the beginning was the Word\u201d):\n\n\nUnder the name \u201cBeginning\u201d or \u201cPrinciple\u201d,\nunderstand the Father, under \u201cWord\u201d the Son, and because a\nword cannot exist without a breath, consequently also understand the\nHoly Spirit. (In Ioh. n.82; LW III:70; EE 152)\n\n\nHowever, as we have seen, the intellection of God is not wholly\nself-contained in the internal activity of bullitio. Rather,\nGod\u2019s self-communication is also outward-directed, and it is\nthis notion of \u201cebullitive\u201d divine speech that allows\nEckhart to better express how it is that God\u2019s intellection is\nessentially causative: In speaking the Word in love, God \u201cboils\nover\u201d into creation and thereby also \u201cspeaks\u201d the\nworld into existence. There is therefore a very real sense in which we\nmight characterize Eckhart\u2019s views on God and creation (whether\nin the context of viewing God as esse or\nintelligere) as a verbal ontology (Duclow 1984).\n\nEckhart\u2019s ontology is verbal not only in the sense that\nGod the Father speaks but also regarding what is spoken (even\nif in a strict sense the activity of God\u2019s speaking and the\ncontent of God\u2019s speech is identical). In fact, it is the\n\u201cWord\u201d or logos spoken by the Father that lies at\nthe center of Eckhart\u2019s philosophical theology and unites the\napproach to God-as-intellect in the Parisian Questions with\nthat of being-as-God in the prologue to the Opus tripartitum.\nEckhart use of the term principle is key here. As was not\nuncommon for his time, Eckhart interpreted the phrase \u201cIn\nprincipio\u201d that opens both the book of Genesis and the\ngospel of John as referring not only to the temporal beginning of the\nuniverse but also to the \u201cprinciple\u201d that designates the\norigin of and ratio underlying all creation. Thus, when\nconsidering God under the aspect of plenitudinous being, Eckhart tends\nto use principium to designate the internal principle of the\nTrinitarian Godhead. This principle is equated with the Neoplatonic\n\u201cOne\u201d (understood either as the conceptually\npre-Trinitarian Godhead itself or as God the Father), who is the\nfontal source or \u201cgenerator\u201d of the Son and Spirit in the\ninternal activity of bullitio\u2014which, as we have seen\nabove, culminates in the expressive ebullitio of divine\nplenitude into creation (McGinn 2001: 75).\n\nOf course, the Godhead\u2019s \u201coverflowing\u201d of being into\ncreation puts God in the role of efficient cause, whereas Eckhart\nfocuses his energies predominantly on the divine viewed as the\nessential or formal cause of creation (such causes\nbeing the proper domain of metaphysics, according to the Meister).\nHere, it is the act of divine intellection in the form of the\nverbum in principio\u2014i.e., the second person of the\nTrinity, the Son\u2014that stands at the center of the\nMeister\u2019s account of the relation between God and creation. In\nhis receptive role as the person of the Trinity most immediately\ngenerated by the One, the Son can appropriately be called \u201cthe\nprinciple from the principle\u201d, as he \u201creceive[s]\nthe power to flow\u201d solely from the Father, who is \u201cthe\nprinciple without principle\u201d (In Ioh. n. 656; LW\nIII:570; quoted in McGinn 2001: 75). At the same time, in his role as\nthe content of divine speech\u2014that which is spoken by (but is\nalso one with) the Father\u2014the Son contains the ratio of\nall intelligible forms and can thus be characterized as \u201cthe\nWord in the principle\u201d (In Ioh. n.12; LW\nIII:12; EE 126). In this respect, the Son, as emanated by the One, is\nboth the representation or \u201cimage\u201d of the Father and\nhimself \u201cthe blueprint of all creatures\u201d (Pr.\n117; DW IV/2:1123; SW 245), who in turn are the images and signs\npointing back to the divine. The Son qua Word, Idea, or\nlogos is thus simultaneously the receptive\n\u201cconduit\u201d of ebullitio and the active,\nintellectual formal cause of (and ultimate exemplar for) all creation.\nAny genuine reality that particular creatures might have from the\nDivine is mere \u201cformal being\u201d (esse formale), but\nthe Word contains their being \u201cvirtually\u201d (esse\nvirtuale), a mode of being which Eckhart considers to be\n\u201cprior and more eminent\u201d (In Ioh. n.38; LW\nIII:32\u20133; EE 135), insofar as the latter is eternal and\nunchanging, whereas the former is transient and mutable. Thus, even if\nthere was no time \u201cbefore\u201d creation, when we consider the\nuniverse under the aspect of being still-uncreated, \u201ceverything\nin the universe was not mere nothing, but was in possession of virtual\nexistence\u201d in the Word (In Ioh. n.45; LW III:37; EE\n137). Importantly, this \u201cvirtual existence\u201d that things\nhave in their \u201cprinciple\u201d or \u201cIdea\u201d is the\n\u201creally real\u201d mode of existing (McGinn 1981: 40).\nEverything else is just an image.\n\nEckhart\u2019s verbal \u201conto-logos\u201d not only\nreconciles the idea of God as absolute (plenitudinous) being and pure\n(intellectual) nothingness, it also shows how his views on analogy and\nunivocity are related. On the one hand, insofar as the Word is the\nconduit or medium of divine speech, it can be\nunderstood as the pure intellect\u2014the \u201cno-thing\u201d that\nis \u201cbeyond being\u201d\u2014through which the principial\nGodhead flows, thereby lending or communicating being to creatures as\nan essential (and final) cause. In this respect, the divine activity\nof ebullitio, in which all things are created\nthrough the Word, establishes an analogical\nrelationship between God and creatures, since there are clear\nrelationships of causal dependence and superiority in play. But\ninsofar as the Word is the content of divine speech\u2014the\nexpression of God thinking Godself and containing all things as one in\nthe divine mind\u2014it grounds the essences of creatures\nand thus represents a univocal cause of the perfections in\nthings, as well as the very ground of the human soul (McGinn 2001: 77;\nMojsisch 1983 [2001: 33]).\n",
