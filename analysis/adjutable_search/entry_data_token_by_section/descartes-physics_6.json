    "main_text": "The Problem of Relational Motion\n5. The Problem of Relational Motion\n\nAs discussed in previous sections, there are various ways in which\nDescartes\u2019 laws of motion violate a strict relationism. One of\nthe most problematic instances involves the relational compatibility\nof the fourth and fifth collision rules. Whereas the fourth rule\nconcludes that a large object remains at rest during impact with a\nsmaller moving body, such that the smaller body is deflected back\nalong its initial path, the fifth rule concludes that a large body\nwill move a smaller stationary object, \u201ctransferring to [the\nsmaller body] as much of its motion as would permit the two to travel\nsubsequently at the same speed\u201d (Pr II 50). From a relational\nstandpoint, however, rules four and five constitute the same type of\ncollision, since they both involve the interaction of a small and\nlarge body with the same relative motion (or speed difference) between\nthem. One might be tempted to appeal to the basic Cartesian tenet that\nmotion and rest are different intrinsic states of bodies, or the\nreciprocity of transfer thesis, to circumvent this difficulty (see\nsection 3): i.e., there is an ontological difference between a body\nthat is, or is not, undergoing a translation with respect to its\ncontiguous neighborhood, and this is sufficient to distinguish the\ncase of rule four from rule five (since the large body is really at\nrest in four, and really in motion in five).\n\nThe problem with this line of reasoning, however, is that it only\nworks if one presupposes that the two bodies are approaching one\nanother, and this is not a feature of the system that can be captured\nby sole reference to the contiguous neighborhood of each individual\nbody. Even if there is reciprocity of transfer between a body and its\nneighborhood, it is still not possible to determine which collision\nrule the impact will fall under, or if the bodies will even collide at\nall, unless some reference frame is referred to that can compute the\nmotion of both bodies relative to one another. Suppose, for instance,\nthat a certain spatial distance separates two bodies, and that one of\nthe bodies is, and the other is not, undergoing a translation relative\nto its neighboring bodies. Given this scenario, it is not possible to\ndetermine if; (i) the translating body is approaching the\nnon-translating body, or (ii) the spatial interval between them\nremains fixed and the translating body simply undergoes a change of\nneighborhood (i.e., the neighborhood moves relative to a stationary\nbody). In short, Descartes\u2019 reciprocity of transfer thesis\nunderdetermines the outcome of his bodily collisions, as well as the\ncapacity to apply, and make predictions from, the Cartesian collision\nrules. The context of the collision rules also supports the view that\nthe motions of the impacting bodies are determined from an external\nreference frame, rather than from the local translation of their\ncontiguous neighborhoods. In elucidating the fourth rule, for\ninstance, Descartes states that B could never move C\n\u201cno matter how great the speed at which B might\napproach C\u201d (Pr II 49)\u2014and only an external perspective,\nnot linked to the bodily reciprocity of transfer, could determine that\nB \u201capproaches\u201d C. Such admissions make\nit very difficult to reconcile Descartes\u2019 physics with a strict\nrelational theory of space and motion, although it may be compatible\nwith weaker forms of relationism that can countenance various external\nreference frames, structures, or other methods for determining the\nindividual states of bodily motion. These weaker relationist\nstrategies (or even non-relational, absolutist interpretations) of\nDescartes\u2019 physics come at a high price, however, since the\nreciprocity of transfer thesis must be abandoned. For these reasons,\nit is more likely that Descartes\u2019 reciprocity of transfer thesis\nis intended to counter any interpretation that regards motion as\ncaused by a bodily property, as some Scholastics had held (such as\nBuridan), rather then defend relational motion (see Maier 1982 on\nthese earlier views of motion). That is, if there is nothing in the\nmoving body that differs from its neighborhood of contiguous bodies\n(see Pr II 30), then a body\u2019s motion is not due to it possessing\na special property that its neighborhood lacks.\n",
