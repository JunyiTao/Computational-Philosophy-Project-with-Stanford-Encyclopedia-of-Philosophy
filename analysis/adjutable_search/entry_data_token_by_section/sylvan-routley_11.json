Moral Philosophy\n\n\nIn this section we describe Sylvan\u2019s work in moral philosophy.\nHis seminal and frequently reprinted (1973; see also SEP entry\n\u201cEnvironmental Ethics\u201d Section 2) was, alongside Naess\n(1973), the first published work in environmental ethics and began a\ncentral debate in the area, one concerned with intrinsic value in\nnature. Elaborated on in Routley and Routley (1979b) and (1980a), this\nwork developed arguments against what he termed \u201chuman\nchauvinism\u201d\u2014the view that humans are exceptional in being\nthe sole locus of intrinsic value, all else having merely instrumental\nvalue. Alongside this work in environmental ethics more broadly, which\nwas to continue until his death, he also published in defence of\npacifism, against nuclear war, and was one of the first philosophers\nto point to the emerging moral issues associated with anthropogenic\nglobal warming.\n",
