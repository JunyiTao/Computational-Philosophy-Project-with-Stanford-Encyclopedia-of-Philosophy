Existentialist Marxism: Critique of Dialectical Reason\n\nWhile Search for a Method (1957) had been published earlier,\nit is not until 1960 that Sartre completed the first\nvolume\u2014\u201cTheory of Practical Ensembles\u201d\u2014of what\nis his final systematic work of philosophy, Critique of\nDialectical Reason. The second volume, \u201cThe Intelligibility\nof History\u201d, was published posthumously in French in 1985. It\nwould be 1991 before both volumes were to be available in English,\nwhich goes some of the way towards explaining their subsequent\nneglect. It is also a book that rivals Being and Nothingness\nfor difficulty, even if some of its goals and ambitions can be\nexpressed straightforwardly enough. Never a member of the French\nCommunist Party, Sartre nonetheless begins by laying his Marxist cards\non the table: \n\n\nwe were convinced at one and the same time that historical materialism\nfurnished the only valid interpretation of history and that\nexistentialism remained the only concrete approach to reality. (Sartre\n1957 [1963: 21]) \n\n\nCritique offers a systematic attempt to justify these two\nperspectives and render them compatible. In broad terms, some of the\nmain steps needed to effect such a synthesis are clear, most notably\nto deny or limit strong structuralist and determinist versions of\nMarxism. Borrowing some themes from Merleau-Ponty\u2019s Humanism\nand Terror, Sartre maintained that any genuinely dialectical\nmethod refuses to reduce; it refuses scientific and economic\ndeterminism that treats humans as things, contrary to reductive\nversions of Marxism. He pithily puts his objection to such\nexplanations in terms of what we might today call the genetic fallacy.\nSartre says, \n\n\nValery is a petit bourgeois intellectual, no doubt about it. But not\nevery petit bourgeois intellectual is Valery. The heuristic inadequacy\nof contemporary Marxism is contained in these two sentences. (Sartre\n1957 [1963: 56]) \n\n\nMoreover, for Sartre, class struggle is not the only factor that\ndetermines and orients history and the field of possibilities. There\nis human choice and commitment in class formation that is equally\nfundamental. The way in which this plays out in Critique is\nthrough an emphasis on praxis rather than consciousness, which we have\nseen is also characteristic of his existential psychoanalytic work of\nthe prior decade.\n\nWithout being able to adequately summarise the vast Critique\nhere (see Flynn 1984), one of the book\u2019s core conceptual\ninnovations is the idea of the practico-inert. Sartre defines this as\n\u201cthe activity of others insofar as it is sustained and diverted\nby inorganic inertia\u201d (Sartre 1960a [1976: 556]). The concept is\nintended to capture the forms of social and historical sedimentation\nthat had only minimally featured in Being and Nothingness. It\nis the reign of necessity, \n\n\nthe domain \u2026 in which inorganic materiality envelops human\nmultiplicity and transforms the producer into its product. (Sartre\n1960a [1976: 339]) \n\n\nFor Sartre, the practico-inert is the negation of humanity. Any\nreaffirmation of humanity, in which genuine freedom resides, must take\nthe form of the negation of this negation (negation is productive\nhere, as it also was in Being and Nothingness). For Sartre,\nthen, there are two fundamental kinds of social reality: a positive\none in which an active group constitutes the common field; and a\nnegative one in which individuals are effectively separated from each\nother (even though they appear united) in a practico-inert field. In\nthe practico-inert field, relations are typified by what Sartre calls\nseriality, like a number, or a worker in a factory who is allocated to\na place within a given system that is indifferent to the individual.\nSartre\u2019s prime example of this is of waiting for a bus, or\nstreet-car, on the way to work. If the people involved do not know\neach other reasonably well there is likely to be a kind of anonymity\nto such experiences in which individuals are substitutable for each\nother in relation to this imminent bus, and their relations are\norganised around functional need. If the bus is late, or if there are\ntoo many people on it, however, those who are waiting go from being\nindifferent and anonymous (something akin to what Heidegger calls\ndas Man in Being and Time) to becoming competitors\nand rivals. In a related spirit Sartre also discusses the serial unity\nof the TV watching public, of the popular music charts, bourgeois\nproperty, and petty racism and stereotyping as well. These collective\nobjects keep serial individuals apart from one another under the\npretext of unifying them. Sartre thus appears to accept a version of\nthe Marxian theses concerning commodity fetishism. This competitive or\nantagonistic dimension of the practico-inert is amplified in\nsituations of material scarcity. This kind of seriality is argued to\nbe the basic type of sociality, thus transforming the focus on dyadic\nconsciousnesses of Being and Nothingness. In the\nCritique, otherness becomes produced not simply through the\nlook that Sartre had previously described as the original meaning of\nbeing-for-others, but through the sedimentation of social processes\nand through practico-inert mediation. Society produces in us serial\nbehaviour, serial feelings, serial thoughts, and \u201cpassive\nactivity\u201d (Sartre 1960a [1976: 266]), where events and history\nare conceived as external occurrences that befall us, and we feel\ncompelled by the force of circumstance, or \u201cmonstrous\nforces\u201d as Sartre puts it. It is the practico-inert, modified by\nmaterial and economic scarcity, which turns us into conflictual\ncompetitors and alienates us from each other and ourselves. Only an\nend to both material scarcity and the alienating mediation of the\npractico-inert will allow for the actualisation of socialism.\n\nWhile Sartre is pessimistic about the prospects for any sort of\npermanent revolution of society, he maintains that we get a fleeting\nglimpse of this unalienated condition in the experience of the\n\u201cgroup in fusion\u201d. This occurs when the members of a group\nrelate to each other through praxis and in a particular way. The group\nin fusion is not a collective \u00e0 la the practico-inert,\nbut a social whole that spontaneously forms as a plurality of serial\nindividuals respond to some danger, pressing situation, or to the\nlikelihood of a collective reaction to their stance (Flynn 1984: 114).\nWe could consider what happens when an individual acts so as to make\nmanifest this serial otherness, like Rosa Parkes when she refused to\ngive up her seat and thus drew attention to the specific nature of the\ncolonialist seriality at the heart of many states in the USA. This\nsometimes creates a rupture and others might follow. Sartre\u2019s\nown prime example is of a crowd of workers who were fleeing during the\nFrench Revolution in 1789. At some point the workers stopped fleeing,\nturned around and reversed direction, suddenly energised alongside\neach other by their practical awareness that they were doing something\ntogether. For this kind of \u201cfusion\u201d to happen it must\nfulfil the following four key conditions for genuine reciprocity that\nFlynn summarises as follows:\n\nThat the other be a means to the exact degree that I am a means\nmyself, i.e., that he be the means towards a transcendent goal and not\nmy means;\nThat I recognize the other as praxis at the same time as I\nintegrate him into my totalizing project;\nThat I recognize his movement towards his own ends in the very\nmovement by which I project myself towards mine;\nThat I discover myself as an object and instrument of his own ends\nby the same act that makes him an object and instrument of mine.\n(Flynn 1984: 115, also see previous version of this entry [Flynn 2004\n[2013]] and cf. Sartre 1960a [1976: 112\u20133]).\n\n\nSartre calls the resurrection of this freedom an\n\u201capocalypse\u201d, indicating that it is an unforeseen and\n(potentially) revolutionary event that happens when serial abuse and\nexploitation can no longer be tolerated. The group in fusion has a\nmaximum of praxis and a minimum of inertia, but serial sociality has\nthe reverse.\n\nUnfortunately, Sartre insists that this group in fusion is destined to\nmeet with what he calls an \u201contological check\u201d in the form\nof the institution, which cannot be escaped as some versions of\nanarchism and Marxism might hope. The group relapses into seriality\nwhen groups are formalised into hierarchical institutional structures.\nSerial otherness comes to implicate itself in interpersonal relations\nin at least three ways in the institution: sovereignty; authority; and\nbureaucracy (see Book 2, Chapter 6, \u201cThe Institution\u201d).\nFrom the co-sovereignty of the group in fusion, someone inevitably\nbecomes sovereign in any new social order. Similarly, a\ncommand-obedience relation comes about in institutions, to greater and\nlesser extents, and there will be exhortations to company loyalty, to\ndo one\u2019s duty, etc. (Flynn 1984: 120). Bureaucratic rules and\nregulation also inevitably follow, partly as a reaction to fear of\nsovereignty, and this installs what Sartre calls vertical\notherness\u2014top-down hierarchies, as opposed to the horizontal and\nimmanent organisation of the group in fusion (Sartre 1960a [1976:\n655\u2013663]). As such, the revolutionary force of the group in\nfusion is necessarily subject to mediation by the practico-inert, as\nwell as the problems associated with institutionality just described.\nAlthough is it still structured through a series of oppositions, the\nCritique delivers a sophisticated social ontology that both\naddresses some weaknesses in Sartre\u2019s earlier work and unifies\nthe social and political reflections of much of his later work.\n",
