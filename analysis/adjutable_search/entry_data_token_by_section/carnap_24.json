    "main_text": "Inductive Logic and the Re-Emergence of the Theoretical Language || Inductive Logic\n8.2 Inductive Logic\n\nWhy did Carnap decide to change directions so radically, at the age of\n52? This is unusual in a philosopher, especially as in Carnap\u2019s\ncase it involved reading his way into a whole new field of inquiry, as\nwell as learning a whole new branch of mathematics. We know that the\nidea of a \u201cdegree of confirmation\u201d had interested him\nsince at least the time of \u201cTestability and Meaning\u201d. At\nthis time, as we saw in\n section 8.1\n above, he thought it could be defined only comparatively, since he\nrejected Reichenbach\u2019s conflation of truth-value with frequency\nas well as his identification of relative frequency and confirmation\n(Carnap 1935b, 1936\u201337). And it had been the accepted wisdom in\nthe Vienna Circle that the classical (epistemic) interpretation of\nprobability had been entirely superseded by the frequency\ninterpretation, partly because the latter relied on Laplace\u2019s\nmuch-criticized principle of indifference, which they classified as\nmetaphysical. Even Keynes (1921) had given insufficiently clear\narguments and his axioms were defective, they thought, but there was\ninterest in Wittgenstein\u2019s logical (purely analytic) conception\nof probability, suggested in the Tractatus, and developed in\nmore detail by Waismann (1930).\n\nThen in 1937, right after \u201cTestability and Meaning\u201d,\nCarnap was sent the typescript of Reichenbach\u2019s Experience\nand Prediction for evaluation by the University of Chicago Press.\nIn a long letter to Reichenbach he takes him to task for exaggerating\nthe drawbacks of what Reichenbach chastises as the \u201cdisparity\nconception\u201d of probability, whereby the \u201cweight\u201d (or\n\u201cdegree of confirmation\u201d as Carnap also calls it) and\nprobability (understood as relative frequency) are two separate\n(disparate) things. Reichenbach had gone so far in his submitted\ndraft, apparently, as to claim that the disparity conception was not\nonly the root of all philosophical error, but a form of metaphysics.\nCarnap says that he himself is not sure what side he is on regarding\nthe disparity conception (and there is no reason to doubt this, in\n1937, as far as we know), but he thinks both its acceptance and its\nrejection are perfectly compatible with empiricism, and advises\nReichenbach to tone down his rhetoric.\n\nThough he was open-minded about the \u201cdisparity conception\u201d\nduring this period, it was only in the spring of 1941, according to\nCarnap\u2019s autobiography, that he \u201cbegan to reconsider the\nwhole problem of probability\u201d (1963a: 72). He re-read\nKeynes\u2019s book more carefully, and found it very enlightening\n(ibid.). He began to develop a new conception of confirmation,\ninfluenced by both Waismann and Keynes:\n\n\nBut I tried a new approach. I believed that the logical concept of\nprobability should supply an exact quantitative explication of a\nconcept which is basic in the methodology of empirical science, viz.\nthe concept of the confirmation of a hypothesis. (1963a: 72)\n\n\nThe starting point of Carnap\u2019s new inductive logic was, first of\nall, precisely Reichenbach\u2019s \u201cdisparity\nconception\u201d\u2014i.e., to distinguish very clearly between two\ndifferent explicata of the ordinary-language word\n\u201cprobability\u201d. One was relative frequency, which is an\nempirical matter, and was held up as the only acceptable\ninterpretation of the Kolmogorov probability calculus by frequentists\nsuch as von Mises, Reichenbach, and (classically) Ronald Fisher. The\nother was epistemic probability, which Keynes and Harold Jeffreys held\nto be the only acceptable interpretation. Carnap called them\n\u201cprobability2\u201d and\n\u201cprobability1\u201d respectively, and set about\nclearing the ground for an explication of the latter, without casting\nany doubt on the legitimacy of \u201cprobability2\u201d\nas an empirical tool. This distinction was the main focus of\nCarnap\u2019s first article on inductive logic (Carnap 1945a).\n\nThe conception he developed in his next article (Carnap 1945b) was\nindeed logical in the Wittgenstein-Waismann sense, in that the\nrelation between observation sentences and hypothesis was purely\nlogical and analytic. To achieve this, a relativized principle of\nindifference was needed; unlike that of Laplace or Keynes,\nCarnap\u2019s was entirely language-relative (framework-relative); it\nwas no longer a quasi-metaphysical assertion about the nature of\ndistributions, let alone about the statistical nature of the world,\nbut a matter of constitutive definition. As in any other area of\nknowledge, Carnap thought it essential to define the framework before\nmaking assertions, so that we are all on the same page. (This logical\nor \u201cstructural\u201d conception of probability and the\nrelativized principle of indifference are explained in concrete detail\nin the supplement\n Inductive Logic.)\n This means that the value of a confirmation measure as applied to a\nhypothesis and the evidence for or against it is an analytical\nconsequence (in the chosen language framework) of the logical and\ninductive method given by the framework.\n\nIn 1950, Carnap published what would be longest book of his career by\nfar, the Logical Foundations of Probability, into which he\nworked these two papers (much expanded) and several others, and also\nwent into great detail to bring a number of perspectives to bear on\nthe clarification of the explicanda of \u201cprobability\u201d and\n\u201cconfirmation\u201d (both in the sense of\nprobability1). He also goes into detail to discuss ways of\narriving at axioms, and to motivate the choices he ends up with. In\nthe course of these clarifications he addresses a number of\nphilosophical issues surrounding induction, confirmation, and\nscientific inference. A simpler exposition than Carnap himself gave of\nhis inductive logic project was given later by Kemeny (1963). See the\nsupplement\n Inductive Logic\n for further details.\n\nCarnap\u2019s inductive logic encountered a wide range of criticisms,\ne.g., that of Hilary Putnam, whose philosophical development had been\nstrongly influenced by regular meetings with Carnap at Princeton in\nthe 1950s. Putnam criticized the general idea of an algorithmic\naccount of the inductive confirmation of scientific hypothesis by\nevidence (as exemplified by the special confirmation measure \\(c^*\\)\nthat is described in the appendix of Carnap 1950b), while at the same\ntime laying the foundations of what would become formal learning\ntheory (see Putnam 1963 and the concluding section of the\nsupplement\n Inductive Logic).\n But perhaps the biggest obstacle to a better and more widespread\nunderstanding of Carnap\u2019s inductive logic was the memorable\ncaricature of Carnap\u2019s whole enterprise by Karl Popper in his\nattacks on Carnap during the 1950s and 1960s (e.g., Popper 1963).\nThese were so convincing that the philosophical public retained only\nthe caricature and hardly bothered to consult the original. In other\nwords, the same pattern repeated itself that we have already seen with\nrespect to the Quine-Carnap controversies of the 1950s and 60s\n (section 7\n above)\u2014for a long time, the general philosophical public\nretained only one side of the debate, influenced mainly by\nQuine\u2019s (and then Popper\u2019s) superior rhetorical skills, as\na result of which both Quine and Popper were much more widely read\nthan Carnap (though Quine\u2019s proximity to traditional American\npragmatism surely also played a role). The difference between these\ncases is that Popper, unlike Quine, actually misrepresented\nCarnap\u2019s position quite blatantly, as Carnap\u2019s supporters\n(e.g., Bar-Hillel 1955, 1956; Kemeny 1955, 1963) were quick to point\nout. (Michalos 1971 gives a well-informed, brief, but balanced survey\nof the Popper-Carnap controversy.)\n\nStatisticians (and statistically literate philosophers) have been\nquicker to acknowledge not only the continuity between Carnap\u2019s\ninductive logic and the present-day renaissance of Bayesian\nstatistical inference, but Carnap\u2019s role in bringing epistemic\nprobability back from the dead and ensuring that it was taken\nseriously again (e.g., Leblanc 1962; Skyrms 1996; Zabell 2007, 2011).\nMany of the standard features of current Bayesianism were first\nformulated in Carnap\u2019s Logical Foundations and in his\nsubsequent work. Carnap went on working on inductive logic for another\n20 years after Logical Foundations; his final statement (the\n\u201cBasic System\u201d), in which prior probabilities depended on\ngeometrical \u201cquality space\u201d features of the given\nframework, appeared after his death in two long installments, edited\nby his friend and associate Richard Jeffrey (Carnap 1971a, 1980; for\nan extensive discussion of the \u201cBasic System\u201d, see\nHilpinen 1973, Sznajder 2017). His later work appeared to move in a\nmore \u201cpersonalist\u201d direction (though see Sznajder 2018),\nbut Carnap continued to insist that the prior probability from which a\nstatistical inference proceeds be motivated rationally (by\nconsiderations of symmetry) and not be merely subjective;\nhere he stuck to his original idea of the relation between evidence\nand hypothesis being purely analytic and thus framework-relative.\nThough this distinguishes his standpoint from current subjective\nBayesians, there are and have been many other kinds of Bayesians that\nare reasonably close to Carnap\u2019s views, including\n\u201cobjective\u201d Bayesians (e.g., Jaynes 1968, J. Williamson\n2010). (For more on Carnap\u2019s relation to current Bayesianism and\nvarious discussions of it today, see the supplement\n Inductive Logic.)\n As one prominent Bayesian pointed out in 1971, one can distinguish at\nleast 46,656 possible varieties of Bayesians (Good 1971), and Zabell\n(a later prominent Bayesian) thinks Carnap would surely qualify for\ninclusion among these. Zabell also cites a characteristically\nconciliatory passage from Carnap\u2019s posthumous \u201cBasic\nSystem\u201d that sums up Carnap\u2019s appraisal of the\nsituation:\n\n\nI think there need not be a controversy between the objectivist point\nof view and the subjectivist or personalist point of view. Both have a\nlegitimate place in the context of our work, that is, the construction\nof a set of rules for determining probability values with respect to\npossible evidence. At each step in the construction, a choice is to be\nmade; the choice is not completely free but is restricted by certain\nboundaries. Basically there is merely a difference in attitude or\nemphasis between the subjectivist tendency to emphasize the existing\nfreedom of choice, and the objectivist tendency to stress the\nexistence of limitations.
