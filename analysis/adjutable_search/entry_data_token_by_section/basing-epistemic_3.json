    "main_text": "Causal-Doxastic Theories of the Basing Relation\n4. Causal-Doxastic Theories of the Basing Relation\n\nThe basic idea of causal-doxastic theories is that a belief may be\nbased on a reason if either an appropriate meta-belief is present (as\nin doxastic theories of the basing relation) or the reason causes the\nbelief in an appropriate way (as in causal theories of the basing\nrelation). One motive for such a view is to avoid superstitious-lawyer\nstyle counterexamples while preserving the intuition that a\nreason\u2019s causing a belief can sometimes establish a basing\nrelation. A second, more fundamental motive begins with the\nobservation that a belief is based on a reason when one has, with\nregard to the belief, taken proper account of the evidential import of\nthe reason. It would be odd if, e.g., the conscious evaluation and\nacceptance of the evidential import of a potential reason for a belief\nwas, in principle, completely irrelevant to whether the belief was\nbased on the reason. Intuitively, it seems that taking proper account\nof a reason may merely involve thinking about the evidential import of\nthe reason in the appropriate way, and whether, in addition, the\nreason non-deviantly causes (or, causally sustains) the belief is\nmerely a contingent, empirical matter.\n\nKeith Allen Korcz\u2019s version of a causal-doxastic theory,\nsomewhat simplified, is as follows (Korcz 2000):\n\n(CD) A person S\u2019s belief that p is based on a\nreason r possessed by S at time t if and\nonly if\n\n\nS believes that p at t, and\nEither\n\n\nthe following two conditions are met:\n\n\nr is an (or contributes to the) internal cause, internal\ncausal overdeterminant or internal causal sustainer, at or prior to\nt, of S\u2019s belief that p, and\nr is not rejected at t,\n\n\nor \nthe following four conditions are met:\n\n\nS at t has a meta-belief or de re\nawareness to the effect that r is a good reason to believe\np, and\nthe causal explanation of S\u2019s having this\nmeta-belief or state of awareness involves both S\u2019s\nbelief that p and r, and\nr, the belief that p, and any other reason the\nmeta-belief or state of awareness is causally based on meets all the\nrequirements of condition (2)(a), and\nS has no other meta-belief or state of awareness contrary\nto the meta-belief described in condition (b)(i).\n \n \n\n\n\nNote that (CD) makes no allowance for a belief\u2019s being based on\na reason when the reason is no longer possessed. There are no such\nbasing relations, given (CD).\n\nAn internal cause is a causal chain of events such that each link in\nthe chain is either a belief, a reason (construed to include\nperceptual and sensation states, as well as beliefs), or an inference.\nOne\u2019s beliefs, reasons, and inferences collectively constitute\nwhat Korcz calls one\u2019s cognitive structure. The various sorts of\ncauses mentioned in (a)(i) are required to be internal to\nS\u2019s cognitive structure so as to avoid problems with\ndeviant causal chains. Deviant causal chains seem to occur when the\nchain of causal events from a putative reason to a belief veers\noutside the persons cognitive structure. For instance, in\nPlantinga\u2019s example of Sylvia discussed above, the causal chain\nof events includes the event of dropping a cup of tea, and this event\nis not one which occurs within the person\u2019s cognitive structure.\nHowever, Korcz acknowledges that this is not a fully satisfactory\nsolution to the problem of deviant causal chains, given the\ndifficulties of specifying exactly which events are internal to\none\u2019s cognitive system in the appropriate way.\n\nCondition (a)(ii) (and, in effect, condition (b)(iv)) requires that\nthe reason a belief is based on not be rejected. A reason for a belief\nis rejected when the following two conditions are met:\n\nS has a meta-belief to the effect that the reason is no\nlonger a good reason to hold the belief, and\none has no meta-beliefs which contradict the meta-belief described\nin (I).\n\n\nBy virtue of condition (I), this account of rejecting a reason for a\nbelief allows for a belief to cease to be based on a reason even when\nthe reason is still retained (not, e.g., forgotten). For example,\nsuppose I believe that Pablo Neruda was a great poet because all great\npoets are revolutionaries and Neruda was a revolutionary. Later, I\ncome to believe that this inference is invalid, yet also come to\nbelieve that all Nobel Prize winners in literature are great poets and\nthat Neruda won the Nobel prize in literature. Thus, I never lose my\nbelief that Neruda is a great poet and I never lose (at least some of)\nmy original reasons for believing that Neruda was a great poet (I\nstill believe that all great poets are revolutionaries and that Neruda\nwas a revolutionary). Instead, the reasons for which I believe that\nNeruda was a great poet have shifted, in part by virtue of the fact\nthat I have come to believe that my original reasons did not support\nmy belief.\n\nCondition (II) of this account of rejecting reasons excludes\ncontradictory meta-beliefs in order to account for some cases in which\nit is unclear whether the reasons for a belief have been rejected.\nWere a person to have contradictory meta-beliefs (perhaps not\nrecognizing they are contradictory as the result of thinking in\ndifferent terms which in fact have the same referent), it would be\nunclear whether the reasons were still the basis of the belief.\n\nCondition (b)(i) of (CD), by allowing that the meta-belief (or state\nof awareness) merely be to the effect that the reason is a good reason\nto hold the belief, is intended to allow the meta-belief to contain\nany appropriate epistemic concept the individual may possess.\nConditions (b)(ii) and (b)(iii) are intended to exclude cases of\nmeta-beliefs which do not establish basing relations, as in the\nexample of Ezekiel discussed above. Ezekiel has the meta-belief that\nhis belief in God is a good reason to believe everything else he\nbelieves. According to (CD), the reason this meta-belief does not\nestablish a basing relation is that it is not non-deviantly caused by\nboth his belief in God and every other belief he has. Instead, it is\nbased on his cult leader, Exidor, telling him that his belief in God\nis a good reason to believe everything else he believes. For the\nmeta-belief to establish a basing relation, it must be based on (i.e.,\nnon-deviantly caused by) the belief and reason(s) it is about. This\nhelps to ensure that the person has taken appropriate account of the\nevidential import of the reason for the belief, much as it does in\ncausal theories of the basing relation.\n\nOne line of objection to Korcz\u2019s causal-doxastic theory is that\nsimply combining causal and doxastic theories is ad hoc,\ni.e., lacks appropriate theoretical support. In turn, this would\nappear to prevent the theory from helping us to understand the basing\nrelation. The basing relation is presumably a unified epistemic\nconcept calling for a unified analysis, not a haphazard conglomeration\nof different conditions, as a disjunctive analysis of the basing\nrelation as either causes or meta-beliefs would suggest. While the\nanalysis may be unified in the sense that it is a causal analysis\nthrough and through, one would not expect the kinds of causes to be so\ndifferent. This objection gains further support if it is mistakenly\nthought that the primary motive for the theory is merely to avoid\nsuperstitious-lawyer style counter-examples.\n\nOne possible line of response to this sort of objection is to note\nthat an important motive for the theory is a fundamental fact about\nhuman thinking, and not merely the desire to avoid\nsuperstitious-lawyer style counter-examples. Intuitively, a\nbelief\u2019s being based on a reason involves taking into account\nthe epistemic import of the reason, and such a mental operation may be\nof two sorts: either directly causal (where a reason non-deviantly\ncauses a belief) or intentional (where one has a meta-belief to the\neffect that a reason is a good reason to hold a belief). The ability\nto reflect on our beliefs and thereby evaluate them is often thought\nto be an ability which distinguishes human cognition from that of many\nother non-human animals. And to properly evaluate a belief is simply\nto take into proper account its evidential import. Thus, it would be\nhighly implausible if such reflective evaluations were absent from an\naccount of a belief\u2019s being based on a reason. Yet on causal\ntheories of the basing relation, such reflective evaluations are\nsuperfluous. On the other hand, such reflective evaluations do not\nappear necessary for a belief to be based on a reason, as previously\nargued. There seem to be situations in which non-deviant causes are\nsufficient to establish basing relations, again as previously argued.\nTherefore, the disjunctive analysis of (CD) appears to be essential if\nwe are to do justice to the various ways the human mind may take into\naccount the evidential import of reasons.\n",
