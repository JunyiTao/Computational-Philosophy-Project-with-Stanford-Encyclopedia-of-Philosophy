    "main_text": "Life and Works || Genuine Works and Testimonia\n1.7 Genuine Works and Testimonia\n\nNo list of Archytas\u2019 works has come down to us from antiquity,\nso that we don\u2019t know how many books he wrote. In the face of\nthe large mass of spurious works, it is disappointing that only a few\nfragments of genuine works have survived. Most scholars accept as\ngenuine the four fragments printed by Diels and Kranz (B1\u20134).\nBurkert (1972a, 220 n.14 and 379 n. 46) raised some concerns about the\nauthenticity of even some of these fragments, but see the responses of\nBowen (1982) and Huffman (1985 and 2005). Our evidence for the titles\nof Archytas\u2019 genuine writings depends largely on the citations\ngiven by the authors who quote the fragments. Fragments B1 and B2 are\nreported to come from a treatise entitled Harmonics, and the\nmajor testimonia about Archytas\u2019 harmonic theory are likely to\nbe ultimately based on this book (A16\u201319). This treatise began\nwith a discussion of the basic principles of acoustics (B1), defined\nthe three types of mean which are of importance in music theory (B2),\nand went on to present Archytas\u2019 mathematical descriptions of\nthe tetrachord (the fourth) in the three main genera (chromatic,\ndiatonic, and enharmonic \u2013 A16-A19). B3 probably comes from a\nwork On Sciences, which may have been a more general\ndiscussion of the value of mathematics for human life in general and\nfor the establishment of a just state in particular. New support for\nits authenticity has been provided by Schofield (2009). B4 comes from\na work entitled Discourses (Diatribai). The fragment\nitself asserts the priority of the science of calculation (ha\nlogistika, \u201clogistic\u201d) to the other sciences, such as\ngeometry, and thus suggests a technical work of mathematics. The title\nDiatribai would more normally suggest a treatise of ethical\ncontent, however, so that in this work the sciences may have been\nevaluated in terms of their contribution to the wisdom that leads to a\ngood life.\n\nA relatively rich set of testimonia, many from authors of the fourth\ncentury BC, indicate that Archytas wrote other books as well.\nArchytas\u2019 famous argument for the unlimited extent of the\nuniverse (A24), his theory of vision (A25), and his account of motion\n(A23, A23a) all suggest that he may have written a work on cosmology.\nAristotle\u2019s comments in the Metaphysics suggest that\nArchytas may have written a book on definition (A22), and A20 and A21\nmight suggest a work on arithmetic. Perhaps there was a treatise on\ngeometry or solid geometry in which Archytas\u2019 solution to the\nproblem of doubling the cube (A14\u201315) was published. There is\nalso a tradition of anecdotes about Archytas, which probably\nultimately derives from Aristoxenus\u2019 Life of Archytas\n(A7, A8, A9, A11). It is possible that even the testimonia for\nArchytas\u2019 argument for an unlimited universe and his theory of\nvision were derived from anecdotes preserved by Aristoxenus, and not\nat all from works of Archytas\u2019 own.\n\nIt is uncertain whether the treatises On Flutes (B6), On\nMachines (B1 and B7), and On Agriculture (B1 and B8),\nwhich were in circulation under the name of Archytas, were in fact by\nArchytas of Tarentum or by other men of the same name. Diogenes\nLaertius lists three other writers with the name Archytas (VIII 82).\nThe treatise On the Decad mentioned by Theon (B5) might be by\nArchytas, but the treatise by Philolaus with which it is paired is\nspurious (Huffman 1993, 347\u2013350), thus suggesting that the same\nmay be true of the treatise under Archytas\u2019 name.\n",
