    "main_text": "Argument for a Non-contingent Cause || A Deductive Argument from Contingency\n4.1 A Deductive Argument from Contingency\n\nAs an a posteriori argument, the cosmological argument begins\nwith a fact known by experience, namely, that something contingent\nexists. We might sketch out a version of the argument as follows.\n\nA contingent being (a being such that if it exists, it\ncould have not-existed) exists.\n All contingent beings have a sufficient cause of or\nfully adequate explanation for their existence.\nThe sufficient cause of or fully adequate explanation\nfor the existence of contingent beings is something other than the\ncontingent being itself.\nThe sufficient cause of or fully adequate explanation\nfor the existence of contingent beings must either be solely other\ncontingent beings or include a non-contingent (necessary) being.\nContingent beings alone cannot provide a sufficient\ncause of or fully adequate explanation for the existence of contingent\nbeings. \nTherefore, what sufficiently causes or fully\nadequately explains the existence of contingent beings must include a\nnon-contingent (necessary) being.\nTherefore, a necessary being (a being such that if it\nexists, it cannot not-exist) exists.\nThe universe, which is composed of only contingent\nbeings, is contingent.\nTherefore, the necessary being is something other than\nthe universe. (For a Thomistic version of this argument, see\nSiniscalchi 2018: 690\u201393). \n\n\nIn the argument, steps 1\u20137 establish the existence of a\nnecessary or non-contingent being; steps 8\u20139 attempt in some way\nto identify it.\n\nOver the centuries philosophers have suggested various instantiations\nfor the contingent being noted in\n premise 1.\n In his Summa Theologica (I,q.2,a.3), Aquinas argued that we\nneed a causal explanation for things in motion, things that are\ncaused, and contingent\n beings.[1]\n Others, such as Richard Swinburne (2004), propose that the contingent\nbeing referred to in premise 1 is the universe. The connection between\nthe two is supplied by John Duns Scotus, who argued that even if the\nessentially ordered causes were infinite, \u201cthe whole series of\neffects would be dependent upon some prior cause\u201d (Scotus [c.\n1300] 1964: I,D.2,p.1,q.1,\u00a753). Richard Gale (1999) calls this\nthe \u201cBig Conjunctive Contingent Fact\u201d. Whereas the\ncontingency of particular existents is generally undisputed, not the\nleast because of our mortality, the contingency of the universe\ndeserves serious defense (see\n section 4.2).\n Premise 2 invokes a moderate version of the Principle of Causation,\naccording to which there must be a sufficient cause for any contingent\nbeing or event, or of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, according to\nwhich there must be a fully adequate explanation for any contingent\nbeing or event. Applied here, the Principles of Causation or of\nSufficient Reason support the contention that if something is\ncontingent, there must be a sufficient cause of its existence or a\nfully adequate reason or explanation why it exists rather than not\nexists. The point of\n premise 3\n is simply that something cannot cause or explain its own existence,\nfor this would require it to already exist (in a logical if not in a\ntemporal sense).\n Premise 4\n is true by virtue of the Principle of Excluded Middle: what explains\nthe existence of the contingent being either are solely other\ncontingent beings or include a non-contingent (necessary) being.\n Conclusions 6\n and\n 7\n follow validly from the respective premises.\n\nFor many critics,\n premise 5\n (along with\n premise 2)\n holds the key to the argument\u2019s success or failure. The truth\nof 5 depends upon the requirements for an adequate explanation. Using\nthe Principle of Sufficient Reason (PSR), what is required here is an\naccount in terms of sufficient conditions that provides an adequate\nexplanation why the cause had the effect it did, or alternatively, why\nthis particular effect and not another arose. Swinburne (2004:\n75\u201379), and Alexander Pruss (2006: 16\u201318) after him, note\ndiverse kinds of explanations. In a full explanation the\ncausal factors\u2014in scientific causation, contemporary or\nimmediately precedent causal conditions and natural laws; in personal\ncausation, persons and their intentions\u2014 are sufficient for the\noccurrence of an event. They \u201ctogether necessitate the\noccurrence of the effect\u201d (Swinburne 2004: 76). \n\n\nIt does not allow a puzzling aspect of the explanandum to disappear:\nanything puzzling in the explanandum is either also found in the\nexplanans or else explained by the explanans. (Pruss 2006: 17) \n\n\nIt suffices to explain why something comes about given the immediately\npresent causal conditions but leaves unexplained why those explanatory\ncausal conditions and/or reasons themselves hold.\n\nIn a complete explanation, every aspect of the explanandum\nand explanans at the time of the occurrence is accounted for; nothing\npuzzling remains. \n\nA complete explanation of the occurrence of E is a full\nexplanation of its occurrence in which all the factors cited are such\nthat there is no [further] explanation (either full or partial) of\ntheir existence of operation in terms of factors operative at the time\nof their existence or operation. (Swinburne 2004: 78)\n\n\nPruss and Swinburne argue that the kind of explanation required by the\nPSR is a complete explanation.\n\nQuinn argues that an adequate explanation need not require a complete\nexplanation (2005: 584\u201385); a partial explanation might do just\nas well, depending on the context. Among these adequate explanations\nof why this actual world obtains rather than another possible world\n(including one with no contingent beings) is that the universe is an\ninexplicable brute fact or that God strongly actualized the world\n(although not everything in it). He refuses to take sides on the\ndebate between explanations, except to say that science cannot provide\nan adequate explanation if the explanatory chain is infinite, for the\nchain of causes is itself contingent or it ends in an initial\ncontingency not scientifically accountable. However, not only does\nQuinn not clarify what constitutes an adequate explanation, but as\nPruss contends, the PSR \u201cis not compatible with an infinite\nchain of explanations that has no ultimate explanans\u201d (2006:\n17), for in an infinite chain something puzzling remains to be\nexplained, with the result that the PSR would again be invoked to\nexplain what is puzzling. However, as we will question below, is the\nbrute fact of the universe any more unacceptable as a complete\nexplanation than the brute fact of a necessary being (God)?\n\nOne worry with understanding the PSR in this way is that it may lead\nto a deterministic account that not only may bode ill for the success\nof the argument but on a libertarian account may be incompatible with\nthe contention that God created freely. Pruss, however, envisions no\nsuch difficulty, for giving reasons neither makes the event\ndeterministic nor removes freedom. \n\n\nWhat gives sufficiency to explanation is that mystery is taken away,\nfor example, through the citing of relevant reasons, not that\nprobability is increased.... Once we have said that \\(x\\) freely chose\n\\(A\\) for \\(R\\), then the only thing left that is unexplained is why\n\\(x\\) existed and was both free and attracted by \\(R\\). (Pruss 2006:\n157,158) \n\n\nOne might reply that an explanation needs to be given for why \\(x\\)\nwas attracted to \\(R_1\\) rather than to \\(R_2\\), and that if that\nexplanation is given, \\(x\\)\u2019s choice is not free but determined\nby the degree to which \\(x\\) is attracted to different reasons.\nHowever, Pruss might respond that being \u201cattracted by\u201d is\nnot to be understood in any deterministic sense. One might freely\nconsider an option to be the best without being necessitated to choose\nit. The debate hinges on how one understands how reasons function in\nhuman agency. \n\nFinally, some (disputedly, see below) argue that explanations must be\neither natural (impersonal) or non-natural (personal).\n 8\n &\n 9\n assert that if the contingent being identified in\n 1\n is the universe, given that the universe encompasses all natural\nexistents and the laws and principles governing them, the explanation\nmust be in terms of a non-natural, eternal, necessary being that\nprovides an intentional, personal, ultimate explanation. Since the\nargument proceeds independent of temporal considerations, the argument\ndoes not necessarily propose a first cause in time, but allows for a\nfirst or primary sustaining cause of the universe. As Aquinas noted,\nthe philosophical arguments for God\u2019s existence as first cause\nare compatible with the eternity of the universe (On the Eternity\nof the World), although he rejects the latter based on divine\nrevelation.\n\nWhether 8 and 9 are an intrinsic part of the cosmological argument is\ndebated. Kant argued that the argument had two parts, the first\nestablishing the existence of an absolutely necessary being; the\nsecond part, identifying this being as the most real being (1787,\nB633\u201340). Without the second part, the concept of a necessary\nbeing was empty. The issue achieves significance when the question\narises whether the argument has religious significance, that is,\nwhether necessary being to which the argument concludes is God. Some\ncontend that from the concept of a necessary being flow properties\nappropriate to a divine being (Siniscalchi 2018, 693). Timothy\nO\u2019Connor (2004) argues that being a necessary being cannot be a\nderivative emergent property, otherwise the being would be contingent.\nLikewise, the connection between the essential properties must be\nnecessary. Hence, the universe cannot be the necessary being since it\nis mereologically complex. Similarly, the myriad elementary particles\ncannot be necessary beings either, for their distinguishing\ndistributions are externally caused and hence contingent. Rather, he\ncontends that a more viable account of the necessary being is as a\npurposive agent with desires, intentions, and beliefs, whose activity\nis guided but not determined by its goals, a view consistent with\nidentifying the necessary being as God. Koons (as are Craig and\nSinclair 2009: 192\u201394) is willing to identify the necessary\nbeing as God. He identifies seven corollaries regarding God\u2019s\nnature that follow from his mereological construction of the\ncosmological argument (e.g., God as the necessary being is not a mere\naggregate or composite; has its basic attributes by necessity; is not\nessentially located in space or time; etc. (1997). Oppy (1999,\n381\u201384), on the other hand, in critiquing Koons\u2019s\npresentation \u201cof seven corollaries to his (cosmological) proof\nwhich are intended to establish that the First Cause has at least some\nof the attributes which are traditionally attributed to God,\u201d\nexpresses significant skepticism about Koons\u2019s arguments and the\npossibility of such a deductive move to determine its properties.\n\nCritics have objected to key premises in the argument. We will\nconsider the most important objections and responses.\n",
