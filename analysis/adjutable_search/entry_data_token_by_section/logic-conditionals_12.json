    "main_text": "Probabilistic Logics\n5. Probabilistic Logics\n\nThe idea that the right semantics for conditionals may be\nprobabilistic is appealing for at least three reasons. First of all,\nas pointed out by Adams (1965), it is unclear whether it makes sense\nto declare either true or false conditionals with false antecedents.\nAdams thus prefers to think of conditionals as having assertability\nconditions, rather than truth conditions, and justified assertability\nis naturally handled in terms of probability. Adams\u2019s scepticism\nabout truth conditions for conditionals is shared by several authors,\nin particular Gibbard (1980) and Edgington (1995), and it was further\nfueled by Lewis\u2019s (1976) triviality results. Secondly, many\nconditional sentences appear to express only a relation of probable\ninference between antecedent and consequent. Thus, whereas \u201cif\n\\(a=b\\), then \\(a+1=b+1\\)\u201d expresses a purely deductive\nrelation, \u201cif you boil this egg, it will become hard\u201d\nexpresses an inductive relation, and \u201cif the light does not turn\non, then the lamp must be broken\u201d expresses an abductive\nrelation (Douven & Verbrugge 2010; Krzy\u017canowska, Wenmackers,\n& Douven 2013; Douven 2016). But in the same way in which\ninductive and abductive inferences express that a conclusion may be\ninferred from given premises with only a reasonable probability,\nputting these inferences into a conditional appears to demand the\nassignment of a degree of probability to the corresponding sentences.\nThirdly, as stressed by Stalnaker (1970),\n\n\n[a]lthough the interpretation of probability is controversial, the\nabstract calculus is a relatively well defined and well established\nmathematical theory.\n\n\nIndeed, based on its mathematical simplicity, the theory offers a\nuniversal framework in the psychology of reasoning, where conditionals\noccupy central stage (Over, Hadjichristidis, Evans, Handley, &\nSloman 2007). We open this section with Adams\u2019s logic for\nconditionals. We then explain Lewis\u2019s triviality results and the\nproblem they raise for the assignment of probabilities to compounds of\nconditionals.\n",
