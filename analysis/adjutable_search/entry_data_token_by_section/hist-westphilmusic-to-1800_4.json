    "main_text": "Antiquity || Aristotelian Empirical Harmonics: Aristoxenus\n1.4 Aristotelian Empirical Harmonics: Aristoxenus\n\nA disciple of Aristotle, Aristoxenus (fl. 4th century BCE) argues that\nharmonics should not be concerned with an explanation of musical\nphenomena in mathematical terms, but rather describe musical\nstructures through the analysis of musical elements as objects of\nperception. For example, Aristoxenus distinguishes between the\nspeaking and singing voice, the former being characterized by a\ncontinuous movement across pitch space, the latter by intervallic\nmovement from one pitch to another (Elementa Harmonica, book\nI, 9\u201310). On the basis of this distinction, he provides a\ndefinition of note (phthongos) as any pitch on which the\nvoice rests and that has a position in a given melodic line\n(Elementa Harmonica, book I, 9\u201310; for a detailed\ndiscussion of Aristoxenus as a music theorist, see Mathiesen 1999:\n294\u2013344).\n\nAnother striking element in Aristoxenus\u2019 conception is his view\nof musical understanding, which he thinks involves the faculties of\nperception and memory,\n\n\nfor we have to perceive what is coming to be and remember what has\ncome to be. There is no other way of following the contents of music.\n(Elementa Harmonica, book II, 38\u201339)\n\n\nNote that perception is not described as the mere awareness of what is\npresent to our senses at a given time, but includes an anticipation of\n\u201cwhat is coming to be\u201d. Here, Aristoxenus seems to\nanticipate an account of musical understanding similar to the one\nrecently defended by Jerrold Levinson (1997).\n\nAristoxenus\u2019 view of the moral effects of music is harder to\nreconstruct. While it is clear that he thought music to be a proper\nobject of ethical evaluation, he likely had a less dogmatic conception\nof the link between given modes and their moral value than Aristotle\n(see Rocconi 2012 and Barker 2007: 245 ff.).\n",
