    "main_text": "The CAPS Model || Philosophical Relevance of CAPS\n2.2 Philosophical Relevance of CAPS\n\nLeaving aside the situationism debate for a moment, is there anything\nin the CAPS model, at least as presented above, which could be\nrelevant to philosophers working on character? To address this\nquestion, we first need to connect CAPS to character traits, as\nnothing thus far in this section has explicitly mentioned traits.\n\nMischel and company are not very helpful when it comes to making this\nconnection. They say different things about traits in different\nplaces, sometimes wanting to distance themselves from traits and other\ntimes seeming to embrace them. When they do embrace them, they\nunderstand them in different ways, for instance as causal dispositions\n(in some passages) or as mere summaries of past behavior (in other\nplaces).\n\nRather than get bogged down in textual interpretation of\nMischel\u2019s work, we can simply note that there appears to be a\nstraightforward path from the CAPS model to the acceptance of\ncharacter traits understood as causal dispositions to think, feel, and\nact in various ways (see Mumford 1998: 182; Kamtekar 2004: 472, 477;\nAdams 2006: 131\u2013138; Badhwar 2009: 279; Russell 2009: xii, 172,\n292\u2013293, 330; Sosa 2009: 279; Lukes 2009: 292). We have seen\nthat the CAPS model already accepts dispositions to form, say,\ninstrumental beliefs, desires, values, and goals. These were among the\n\u201ccognitive-affective units\u201d. These units tend to be\nrelatively enduring psychological structures in a person\u2019s mind,\nthey are sensitive to their own activating conditions, and, upon being\nactivated, they serve to cause the formation of occurrent mental\nstates like beliefs and (other things being equal) behavior. They are\nalso the basis for true \u201cif\u2026then\u2026\u201d\nconditionals, as we saw earlier.\n\nTo take an example, I am disposed to be afraid of rats. So if one\nlands on my bed, I am likely to run away (to say the least). Upon\nseeing a rat, my fear of rats would be triggered, leading to an\noccurrent feeling of fear of this rat at this particular moment, which\nconnects with other mental goings-on that together lead me to run.\n\nThis last bit about other mental goings-on is important. My\ndisposition to fear rats is connected to all kinds of other\npsychological dispositions, such as a disposition to believe that rats\ncarry diseases and that I should run away from them, a desire to not\ncatch any diseases from rats, and so forth. In other words, the CAPS\nmodel accepts that there are clusters of interrelated mental\nstate dispositions, and that upon being activated they cause multiple\noccurrent thoughts and feelings to be formed. As Mischel and Shoda\nwrite,\n\n\ncognitive-affective representations and affective states interact\ndynamically and influence each other reciprocally. It is the\norganization of the relationships among them that forms the core of\nthe personality structure and that guides and constrains their effects\n(2008: 211, see also 212, 219, 233).\n\n\nThese clusters are typically not fleeting, they can explain the true\n\u201cif\u2026then\u2026\u201d conditionals, and they are\nmanifest in the person\u2019s behavioral signature over time. So if I\nsee a rat on my bed, I will tend to behave a certain way. Similarly if\na few months later I see a rat in the kitchen, and so forth.\n\nBut now that we have clusters of psychological dispositions, we have\neverything we need for a person to have moral character traits too.\nFor we can just equate a moral character trait with a cluster\nof cognitive-affective units which pertain to a given moral domain (as\nMischel seems willing to do in some places; see Mischel and Shoda\n1995: 257; Mischel 1999a: 456). Furthermore, they will be traits with\ncausal powers, since the psychological dispositions which are their\ncomponents have causal powers. Plus they can be global character\ntraits too\u2014they can be activated in a variety of different\nsituations. In my simple example, the cluster of psychological\ndispositions associated with my seeing rats can be activated in\nsituations ranging from the office to the pool to the bedroom. The\nsame could be true for clusters which are more centrally morally\nrelevant. But it is also important to note that the CAPS model by\nitself does not entail that there are global traits\u2014one could\naccept only highly narrow or local traits instead. This is an\nempirical matter.\n\nHence it appears that philosophers may have found a rich psychological\nmodel to use in helping them to develop a more empirically informed\naccount of character traits. This model would allow for character\ntraits to exist, and for them to be widespread, have causal powers,\nand be grounded in enduring psychological structures which are already\nfamiliar from the philosophy of mind.\n\nTwo points of caution are worth making, though. The first concerns the\nrelevance of CAPS in responding to situationism. As we just noted, the\nCAPS model does not by itself support the widespread possession of\nglobal as opposed to local character traits. Furthermore, even if we\njust focus on global character traits, the model does not\u2014by\nitself\u2014provide any reason to think that the character traits\nmost people have are the traditional moral virtues like honesty. They\ncould be moral vices, or mixed traits, or something else altogether.\nSo it turns out that Harman and Doris could accept much of the CAPS\nmodel, and still advance the first stage of their situationist\nargument for the conclusion that most people do not have the\ntraditional moral virtues.\n\nSecondly, while it would take more space than is available here to\nproperly explore, another reason for caution about the relevance of\nCAPS has to do with whether it provides much of a theoretical advance\nover commonsense folk psychology about the mind. The language of\ncognitive-affective units, if\u2026then\u2026situation-behavior\ncontingencies, psychologically salient features of situations, and\nintraindividual behavioral signatures might sound impressive, but\nstripped away of this jargon, the model might not have much new to\noffer to philosophers. Even some psychologists have expressed this\nworry. For instance John Johnson, in a 1999 commentary in European\nJournal of Personality, wrote:\n\n\nOne limitation of the CAPS model is its failure to advance our\nscientific understanding of personality dynamics beyond how we already\nunderstand human action from common sense. As far as I can tell, the\nlabeling and re-labeling of desires, beliefs, and abilities has simply\nreflected the psychological jargon popular at that point in\nhistory\u2026I am surprised and somewhat depressed about the\nenthusiasm for the CAPS model, but not because the model is wrong. The\nproblem is that settling for this model indicates that we are content\nto merely re-label common sense concepts with jargon, as opposed to\ndeveloping a truly scientific model of personality dynamics (Johnson\n1999: 449\u2013450).\n\n\nJohnson focused here on the cognitive-affective units, but his claims\napply more generally to the rest of the CAPS model.\n\nNone of this calls into question the truth of the CAPS model. It just\nraises a concern about how much of an advance the model will prove to\nbe to philosophers working on character, if it turns out to not offer\nany additional theoretical insights, explanatory resources, or novel\npredictions beyond what philosophers can infer based on their own\ncareful reflection on folk psychology (for much more on these issues,\nsee Miller 2016).\n",
