    "main_text": "Other Features of Aesthetic Judgments || Mind-dependence and Nonaesthetic Dependence\n2.2 Mind-dependence and Nonaesthetic Dependence\n\nGiven an understanding of the normativity of judgments of\ntaste\u2014which we might or might not express in terms of aesthetic\ntruth\u2014we can and should add some further normative features.\n\nOne such feature is mind-independence. Mind-independence is\nbest expressed as a negative thesis: whether something is beautiful\ndoes not depend on my judgment. Thinking it so does not make it so.\nThis can be re-expressed in conditional terms: it is not the case that\nif I think something is beautiful then it is beautiful. This is common\nsense. For example, most of us think that our judgments have improved\nsince we were younger. We think that some of our past judgments were\nin error. Thinking it so, at that time, did not make it so. Perhaps\nsome more complicated, sophisticated mind-dependence thesis holds; but\na simple mind-dependence claim flouts common sense.\n\nWe also think that beauty, ugliness and other aesthetic properties\ndepend on nonaesthetic properties. Dependence contrasts with\nmind-independence in that it says what aesthetic properties\ndo depend on, as opposed to what they do not depend\non: the aesthetic properties of a thing depend on its nonaesthetic\nproperties. This dependence relation implies (but is not identical\nwith) the supervenience relation or relations: (a) two aesthetically\nunlike things must also be nonaesthetically unlike; (b) something\ncould not change aesthetically unless it also changed\nnonaesthetically; and (c) something could not have been aesthetically\ndifferent unless it were also nonaesthetically different. These are,\nrespectively: cross-object supervenience, cross-time supervenience,\nand cross-world supervenience. (\u201cSupervenience\u201d has often\nbeen discussed under the heading of \u201cdependence\u201d but they\nare distinct relations, related in a complex way.) Sibley\u2019s\npapers \u201cAesthetic Concepts\u201d and\n\u201cAesthetic/Nonaesthetic\u201d were pioneering discussions of\nthe dependence of the aesthetic on the nonaesthetic (Sibley 1959,\n1965). (It is interesting that he never described the dependence in\nmodal terms.)\n\nThis claim is very intuitive, but let us try to say something more in\nsupport of it. It seems to be a deep fact about beauty and other\naesthetic properties that they are inherently \u201csociable\u201d;\nbeauty cannot be lonely. Something cannot be barely beautiful; if\nsomething is beautiful then it must be in virtue of its nonaesthetic\nproperties. Furthermore, knowing this is a constraint on our judgments\nabout beauty and other aesthetic properties. We cannot just judge that\nsomething is beautiful; we must judge that it is beautiful in virtue\nof its nonaesthetic properties. We usually do so, and not to do so is\nbizarre. (Even in cases of testimony, we think that the aesthetic\nproperties of a thing hold in virtue of nonaesthetic properties that\nthe aesthetic expert knows.) Of course, we might not have in mind\nevery single nonaesthetic property of the thing, nor know exactly how\nthe nonaesthetic properties produce their aesthetic effects. But we\nthink that certain nonaesthetic properties are responsible\nfor the aesthetic properties and that without those nonaesthetic\nproperties, the aesthetic properties would not have been instantiated.\nBeauty does not float free, and recognizing this is constitutive of\naesthetic thought. Our aesthetic thought, therefore, is fundamentally\ndifferent from our thought about colors, with which it is often\ncompared. Perhaps colors are tied in some intimate way to intrinsic or\nextrinsic physical properties of the surfaces of things, such as\nreflectance properties. But color thought does not presuppose this.\nSomeone might even think that colors are bare properties of things.\nBut one cannot think that beauty is bare; it is essential to aesthetic\nthought to realize that the aesthetic properties of a thing arise from\nits nonaesthetic properties.\n\nThe principles of correctness, mind-independence and dependence can be\nphrased in the property mode or in terms of truth. We can cast them\neither way. We can say that whether something is beautiful does not\ndepend on what we think about it, but it does depend on its\nnonaesthetic features. Or we can equally well say that the truth of\naesthetic judgments is independent of our aesthetic judgments but it\nis dependent on nonaesthetic truths. Semantic ascent changes\nlittle.\n",
