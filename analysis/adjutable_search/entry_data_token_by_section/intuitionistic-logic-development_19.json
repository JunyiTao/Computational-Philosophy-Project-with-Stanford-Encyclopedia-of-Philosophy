    "main_text": "The Proof Interpretation Made Explicit || Influences on Heyting\n5.2 Influences on Heyting\n\nA number of influences (or possible influences) on Heyting\u2019s\narriving at the Proof Interpretation can be suggested. The following\nare publications Heyting had all seen by 1927, for he refers to them\nin his dissertation (1925: 93\u201394):\n\nBrouwer 1907 (Ch. 3) and Brouwer 1908C, which forcefully made the\npoint that intuitionistic logic is concerned with the preservation of\nconstructibility. (See\n section 2.1\n above.)\nBrouwer\u2019s proof of the bar theorem from 1924, handed in on\nMarch 29, 1924 (Brouwer 1924D1: 189 [Mancosu 1998: 36]), and perhaps\nalso the later version from 1927, of which the manuscript was handed\nin on April 28, 1926 (Brouwer 1927B: 75 [van Heijenoort 1967: 446]);\nboth show how to operate mathematically on demonstrations as objects.\n(See section\n 3.1.2\n above.)\nWeyl 1921, where universal and existential theorems are considered\nto be not genuine judgements at all, but\n\u201cUrteilsanweisungen\u201d (judgement instructions) and\n\u201cUrteilsabstrakte\u201d (judgement abstracts), thus\nemphasizing that such theorems for their justification need to be\nbacked up by a construction method. Brouwer, in a note on Weyl\u2019s\npaper, agreed, saying \u201cThis is only a matter of name and\ncertainly does not reflect any lacking insight on my part\u201d\n(Mancosu 1998: 122).\n\n\nA further likely influence is Brouwer\u2019s unpublished elucidation\nof the virtual ordering axioms (see\n section 3.1.3\n above). Dirk van Dalen (personal communication) suspects that,\nalthough Heyting was probably not present at this lecture course, he\nheard Brouwer make a similar comment on another occasion (for example\nduring the years 1922\u20131925, when Heyting was working on his\ndissertation under Brouwer, for that work also considers\nintuitionistic orderings).\n",
