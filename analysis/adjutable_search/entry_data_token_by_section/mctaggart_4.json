    "main_text": "McTaggart\u2019s Ontological Idealism\n5. McTaggart\u2019s Ontological Idealism\n\nMcTaggart endorsed both ontological idealism and\nepistemological realism. Epistemological realism, as loosely\nformulated by McTaggart, is the view that knowledge is true (justified)\nbelief, and that truth consists in correspondence with\n reality.[15]\nOntological\nidealism is the view that the sum total of all that exists consists\nin\n persons.[16]\nAccording to McTaggart, although\nreality is composed of persons, it does not follow that nothing is real\nunless it can be known by some\n person.[17]\n\n\nMcTaggart\u2019s version of ontological idealism was inspired by\nhis reading of Hegel. In one of his earlier writings, \u201cThe\nFurther Determination of the Absolute\u201d (reprinted in his\nPhilosophical Studies), McTaggart tells us that Hegel\u2019s\nview of the absolute spirit is that it is made of finite individuals,\neach of which is individuated by how it is related to the others, and\neach of which perceives that every other self is of the same nature as\nitself.\n\n\nMcTaggart more or less interpreted Hegel as holding\nMcTaggart\u2019s own view, which is that reality consists of a series\nof either finitely many or infinitely many persons. Reality is\ncomposed of persons and their states, which are parts of them. Each\nperson is perceived by some person or persons, and a person perceives\nanother person either by perceiving the whole person or by perceiving\nsome part of the person. Since, on McTaggart\u2019s view, persons have\ntheir perceptions (and other mental states) as proper parts, one way to\nperceive a person is by perceiving a perception of that\n person.[18]\nBecause\nMcTaggart allows that x might perceive a perception of\ny without y\u2019s perception being also a\nperception of x, McTaggart distinguishes between perceiving a\nperception (or, more generally, any mental state) and having that\nperception (or, more generally, having that mental\n state).[19]\n\n\nAlthough selves have proper parts, McTaggart denies that any two\nselves can ever share a proper part. Nor is it possible that one self\nis a proper part of another. Further, no experience or mental state in\ngeneral can occur without it being a part of some self. McTaggart\nclaims that these are ultimate synthetic a priori\n truths.[20]\n\n\nAlthough persons have proper parts, the property of being a person\n(which McTaggart calls personality) is a simple,\nunanalyzable\n quality.[21]\nAlthough the self is, in a sense, a bundle of mental states, not every\nbundle of mental states is a\n self.[22]\nWe are acquainted with the property\npersonality, and contra Hume, Bradley, and perhaps Bertrand\nRussell, each of us is acquainted with something that has this\nproperty, namely oneself.\n\nOn McTaggart\u2019s view, our perceptions are grossly mistaken about\nhow things are. It is not clear whether McTaggart holds that our\nperceptions are grossly mistaken about what there is. When a\nmisperception represents the world as containing material objects, are\nthere some objects such that we misperceive them as being\nmaterial?\n\nIn the second volume of the Nature of Existence, McTaggart\nendorsed the view that we never directly perceive material objects, but\nrather infer material objects from what we directly\n perceive.[23]\nSo, on\nMcTaggart\u2019s view, strictly speaking perception never represents\nobjects as being material\n objects.[24]\nPerception, however, does represent the\nexistence of sense-data. But McTaggart also denies that anything is\na\n sense-datum.[25]\nHowever, apparent perceptions of sense-data are really perceptions of\nsomething, namely persons, parts of persons, or sums of person-parts.\nSo my perceptions do succeed in correctly representing the existence of\nsomething other than myself, although my perceptions grossly\nmisrepresent the nature of what is\nperceived.\n\nWhy do we misperceive our perceptions of persons or their parts as\nbeing perceptions of sense-data? Unlike the case of material\nobjects, when we perceive something as a sense-datum, our perception\nitself (rather than a judgment we are led to by the perception) is\nmistaken. McTaggart hypothesizes that, if there is a single cause\nof this widespread error, it must be connected with the fact that we\nmisperceive a C-series as an A-series. This hypothesis is somewhat\nsupported by the fact that whenever we perceive some object, we always\nperceive that object as being in\n time.[26]\nSo the appearance of time is systematically\nconnected with every appearance of something else, and is possibly\nresponsible for radically distorting how that something else appears.\n\n\nMcTaggart\u2019s argument for ontological idealism resists easy\nsummary. In outline, the main moves are as follows. McTaggart first\nargues that every substance is gunky, that is, every substance\nis such that it has a proper part that is also a substance. So for each\nsubstance, there is an infinite series of substances that are parts of\nit (Nature of Existence I, chapter XXII). McTaggart holds\nthat a priori reflection reveals that every substance is necessarily\ngunky, although there might be respects in which some substance is\nsimple. (Were there to be persisting material atoms, there might be\nentities that lack spatial parts, but they would nonetheless have\ntemporal parts.)\n\n\nSecond, according to McTaggart, for each substance, there must be a\nsufficient description of that substance (Nature of Existence\nI, section 105). A substance is described by mentioning its\nqualities. An exclusive description of a substance is a description\nthat applies only to that substance. A sufficient description of a\nsubstance is an exclusive description that mentions only qualities that\nmake no reference to other substances (Nature of Existence I,\nsections\n 101\u2013102).[27]\n\nThird, given that each substance must have a sufficient description,\nthe gunkyness of substances implies a contradiction if substances are\neither material objects or sense-data. McTaggart holds that the\ngunkyness of substances and the requirement that every substance have\nsufficient description result in a contradiction unless the following\nrequirement is satisfied: that the universe divides itself into a set\nof entities \u2013 call them primary parts \u2013 whose\nsufficient descriptions imply sufficient descriptions of every set of\nparts of the universe onto infinity. In order for the sufficient\ndescriptions of primary parts to imply the sufficient descriptions of\nall others, there must exist a relation of \u2018determining\ncorrespondence\u2019 such that all other objects are individuated by\nstanding in the transitive closure of that relation to the primary\nparts, which in turn are individuated independently of standing in any\nrelation of determining\n correspondence.[28]\n\n\nIf material objects or sensa are part of reality, either there is no\nrelation suitable to be a relation of determining correspondence or\nthere are no objects suitable to serve as primary parts of the universe\nbecause they could not be individuated prior to standing in such\na\n relation.[29]\nOne of McTaggart\u2019s arguments for\nthis conclusion has as a premise that objects with spatial properties,\nsuch as material objects, always have their natures in virtue of the\nnatures of their parts. But in this case, unless some material objects\nare such that at each level of their decomposition into proper parts,\nnew qualities sufficient to describe them uniquely are present, no\nmaterial object could serve as a primary part of the universe.\nMcTaggart then argues that no such qualitative variation is to be found\nin the actual\n world.[30]\n\n\nHowever, if the primary parts of reality are persons and the\nrelation of determining correspondence is the relation of perception,\nthen McTaggart holds that every substance can have a sufficient\ndescription even though every substance is\n gunky.[31]\nSince it is possible\nthat every spiritual substance be both gunky and have a sufficient\ndescription, idealism is a live option. That it is possible does not\nshow conclusively that it is actual, but according to McTaggart, absent\nany better hypothesis, it is the one that is reasonable to accept.\nMcTaggart holds that we can conceive of nothing that is not a material\nobject, a sense-datum, or something spiritual, and since the first two\nkinds of objects are metaphysically impossible, the hypothesis of\nidealism is the only conceivable hypothesis left standing.\n",
