    "main_text": "Key Domains Addressed by Social Ontology || Money\n5.6 Money\n\nMenger (1892) tells a story of the emergence of money from trading\npractices. For a society to come to have money, Menger argues, it is\nnot required that anyone in the society made a choice to adopt a\nmedium as money. Instead, in the course of transactions in the\nmarketplace, the marketability of certain goods will tend to increase,\nand as a result, these goods acquire a degree of\n\u201cmoney-character\u201d. Money, in Menger\u2019s view, is\nsimply a good that is highly marketable in transactions, and therefore\nhighly liquid.\n\nThe centerpiece of Menger\u2019s account is the non-intentional\nemergence of money (see Aydinonat 2008, Tieffenbach 2010). But his\naccount also gives an implicit theory of the nature of money. Money is\na simple causal-role kind, with any good that is highly liquid and\nmarketable being money. Introductory economics textbooks tend to\ndefine money as a slightly more complicated role-kind: money is a\nstore of value, a medium of exchange, and a unit of account (Arnold\n2008, Mankiw 2016). Recent work in economics suggests a different set\nof functions for money. A striking feature of standard economic models\nis that money seems superfluous. In idealized neo-classical economies,\nthere is no need for a medium of exchange, nor is it clear why price\nlevels should affect the \u201creal economy\u201d of production and\nconsumption. Thus economists have recently investigated the economic\n\u201cfrictions\u201d that make money useful, and find that money\ncontributes to efficiency in a market that has imperfect\nenforceability of contracts and limited record-keeping. In such an\neconomy, money helps perform operations such as the search for trading\npartners. The overcoming of such economic \u201cfrictions\u201d\nseems to be an alternative and perhaps underlying function of money.\n(See Diamond 1984, Kiyotaki & Wright 1989, Kocherlakota 1998,\nWright 2010, Smit, Buekens et al. 2016.)\n\nThese discussions imply that money is a causal-role kind of some sort.\nThis is questionable, however: such a definition fails to accommodate\ntokens of money that fail to perform those roles (such as a coin\nburied in the ground). Instead, money may be better understood as a\ndifferent sort of functional kind, or perhaps as an artifactual kind\n(see\n section 5.5).\n Alternatively, the nature of money may not involve its functions at\nall. Aristotle (Politics 1.8\u201310) notes that there are\nseveral distinct functions performed by money, each of which would\nnaturally have its own essence; but he points out that we use the same\nmedium for all of these. The money in any given society, he argues, is\na product of agreement in that society.\n\nA story is sometimes told of a historical progression from barter to\nthe use of \u201ccommodity money\u201d (such as gold, cowrie shells,\nor beads) to the use of \u201cfiat money\u201d (such as\ngovernment-issued paper currency) (see Searle 1995, McEachern 2011).\nSearle argues that all kinds of money are \u201cinstitutional\nkinds\u201d, which he analyzes in terms of the collective assignment\nof a function to a substrate. Commodity money, in his view, involves\nassignment to a good with some intrinsic value, while fiat money\ninvolves assignment to a piece of paper printed by the government.\n\nHistorians of money and monetary theorists divide kinds of money along\nmore nuanced dimensions. A few historical cases may qualify as fiat\nmoney, such as in Ming dynasty China, revolutionary France, and the\nAmerican Confederacy, but these were fragile and subject to collapse\n(Yang 1952, Ferguson 2008, Spang 2015). But many contemporary\napproaches emphasize the role of private interactions in the creation\nof money, and importantly, reserve banking as well as credit and debt\nmarkets. Other theories emphasize the role of the state, and in\nparticular the central roles of interest-rate-setting institutions,\ngovernment debt, and the collection of taxes (see Friedman &\nSchwartz 1963, Kaldor 1985, Moore 1988, Deleplace & Nell 1996). In\nthese approaches, questions about the \u201csubstance\u201d of money\nbecome rather peripheral.\n\nSome controversies persist on the substance of money. It was part of\nhistorical debates over the gold standard and\n\u201cbimetallism\u201d, and more recently there has been\nphilosophical discussion of electronic money (Smith & Searle 2003)\nand \u201ccryptocurrencies\u201d such as bitcoin. An ongoing problem\nfor work in the nature of money is the blurring of distinctions\nbetween questions about ontology, about the evolution of money, about\nwhat drives the money supply, and about what makes a monetary system\nstable.\n",
