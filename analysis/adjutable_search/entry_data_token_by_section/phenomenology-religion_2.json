    "main_text": "The phenomenology of religious experience || Religious experience and relationship to material context\n1.2 Religious experience and relationship to material context\n\nSo far we have been concentrating upon religious experience understood\nas experience of God or the sacred otherwise understood. Some\ncommentators have argued that the philosophy of religion literature\nhas paid insufficient attention to the fact that, in the first\ninstance, religious experience is commonly experience of a material\ncontext, a building or landscape for example. And the phenomenology of\nthe experience is therefore given, at least in significant part, in\nour experience of a set of physical objects (Brown 2004).\n\nOn this sort of approach, religious experience is sometimes conceived\nnot so much as an encounter with God considered as a particular item\nof experience, but more as a matter of seeing \u201cin depth\u201d\nthe religious significance of a material context. If we take up this\nsuggestion, then a new range of possibilities for developing a\nphenomenology of religion comes into view.\n\nSome scholars have argued that spaces reserved for religious activity\nhave a distinctive character, which sets them apart from merely\nprofane spaces (Eliade 1958). For instance, an approach to a sacred\nspace may require the believer to cross various thresholds, and\nperhaps to undertake a relatively arduous journey on account of the\ntopography of the place, as when it is set on a mountain or\nisland.\n\nExpounding this tradition of thought, Thomas Barrie notes that:\n\nTo reach the threshold and sacred place, often there is a path and\nentry sequence. The path that leads to the place can take many forms\n\u2026 and typically involves a series of spaces or events, each\nbecoming increasingly more sacred. This sequence acts as a marker of\nthe sacred ground, as protection for the uninitiated, and as a trial\nto be endured for those seeking the divine. (1996, p. 59)\n\n\nSimilarly Barrie writes of how: \u201cThe pilgrim\u2019s route along\nthe path underlines the gravity of the journey being undertaken and\ngives opportunities for the initiate to turn back\u201d (p. 60).\nImplied in this sort of structuring of sacred space is a correlative\nphenomenology: one that requires of the devotee an appropriate\nseriousness and focussed attention, if they are to grasp aright the\nsacred reality that is to be encountered in the sanctuary. (Compare\nJones 2000 on the various strategies of \u201critual-architectural\nallurement.\u201d)\n\nSome Christian commentators have taken exception to this sort of\npicture, arguing that what makes a place religiously special for a\nChristian is simply the presence there of a Christian community,\nengaged in a life of other-regarding love (White 1995). Acknowledging\nthis difference of view, Harold Turner (1979) distinguishes between\nthe domus dei and domus ecclesiae approaches to sacred architecture.\nOn the first perspective, a holy building is conceived as a house of\nGod, and it should therefore be a suitably imposing space, displaying\nsuperior craftsmanship and adorned with the finest materials \u2014\nall of which will imply a correlative phenomenology, whereby the mind\nis lifted up towards God. (Compare Abbot Suger\u2019s account of the\nabbey of Saint Denis.) By contrast, on the domus ecclesiae\nperspective, the church building functions primarily as a meeting\nplace, and its construction should therefore serve the needs of the\ncommunity which gathers there, and facilitate their interaction and\nfellowship.\n\nTurner gives as an example of the domus dei approach the meditation\nroom at the United Nations Headquarters in New York. This space\nfeatures a block of iron ore illuminated by a shaft of natural light\nthat descends from a skylight. Accordingly, the place speaks of a\nmeeting of heaven and earth, of light and dark, and of the ambiguous\nhistory of human beings in their relationship to the earth, in so far\nas iron ore has been used for the making both of weapons and of\nploughshares. And by virtue of the conditions of stillness and dimmed\nlight that obtain here, the room invites a response of quiet,\nreverential seriousness. In all of these respects there is implied,\nonce more, a correlative phenomenology.\n\nIn fact, the relationship between the conception of sacred\narchitecture that Barrie describes and Turner\u2019s domus ecclesiae\ntradition need not be flatly antithetical. For Turner acknowledges\nthat even within a Christian context it will be appropriate to make\nsome use of \u201ctemple\u201d elements, not least for those members\nof the community who have not yet fully assimilated a Christian\nunderstanding of these matters. And more importantly, even a building\nthat adheres uncompromisingly to domus ecclesiae principles will over\ntime take on some of the characteristics of the domus dei ideal\n\u2014 because even when it is not in use for worship, the fact that\nit has been organically caught up in the life of the Christian\ncommunity will quite properly condition our sense of its significance,\nand the sort of use to which it can be put.\n\nHere Turner notes the experience of a young Quaker who contrary to his\nprofessed principles admits to feeling that he ought not to smoke\nwithin the meeting house when he is taking his turn on the cleaning\nrota. This response is fitting, Turner notes, in so far as the history\nof the building as a site of Christian gathering rightly shapes our\nsense of its meaning in the present (pp. 327\u2013328). And this\nsense of the building\u2019s significance will imply a correlative\nphenomenology: the space will be experienced as inviting a respectful\nor dignified kind of appropriation.\n\nOn the other side, Barrie notes that while the sacred place is set\napart as a zone where the gods may be encountered, this is not to say\nthat such places have no part to play in the life of a community. On\nthe contrary, sacred spaces will typically serve as an important focus\nfor a community\u2019s profession of the values that bind it together\n(1996, p. 52).\n\nSome Christian commentators have sought to identify a similar middle\nground by acknowledging that Christian categories, and the Christian\nliturgy, are likely to be experienced as strange or even alien by many\nin modern western societies. The evangelisation of such people may\nwell depend then, in the first instance, not so much upon exposure to\nspecifically Christian concepts as upon experiences of transcendence\nmediated through encounters with the beauty or majesty of the natural\nworld, or of church or other buildings. These experiences serve then\nas a propaedeutic for Christian teaching. (Compare Brown 2004, pp.\n407\u2013408.)\n\nIt is reasonable to suppose, for example, that the religious\nsignificance of the great cathedrals of the medieval period was not\njust a matter of the Christian stories with which they were\nassociated, in so far as they were connected with, say, the deeds of\nparticular holy figures or their relics. Their meaning is also given\nin their sheer sensory impact: through their monumental scale and\ncontrolled use of light, and through the interplay between the\nsolidity of stone and the diaphanous qualities of glass, these\nstructures can speak of the sacred by inducing a response of hushed\nwonderment. A further perspective on the phenomenology of liturgy is\nprovided in the work of Dietrich von Hildebrand, who is interested in\nthe connection between the formation of the person through liturgical\npractice and the development of new ways of engaging with the everyday\nworld in perceptual and other terms. See for instance his comment\nthat:\n\n\nThe man formed by the Liturgy is the man who is awake in the highest\nsense of the word. He is not only inwardly open to hearing the voice\nof God. He is not only aware of the ultimate Truth, but he also looks\non all earthly goods in their true light. Far removed from all\nbluntness, \"indifference,\" stoic insensibility and impassiveness, his\nawakened eye is open to every created thing in its mystery of the\nheight and its divine meaning. Let us recall again the precious and\nnoble character of created things, such as water, for instance, as\ndisclosed in the blessing of the baptismal water. (1943, pp.\n136-7)\n\n\nOf course natural spaces are also able, of themselves, to evoke a\nsense of the sacred. And Erazim Koh\u00e1k has argued that some of\nthe key concepts of western philosophical theology have their original\nlife setting in experiences of nature. On this basis he offers a kind\nof phenomenological rendering of the cosmological and design\narguments.\n\nHe writes for example that:\n\nWe are, though only by a hair. We could easily not be. The stark white\nglow of the January moon, pressing down on the frozen forest, sears\naway the illusion of necessity. (1984, p. 188)\n\n\nHere, Koh\u00e1k is giving a phenomenological counterpart for the\nconcept of contingency. Of course, he does not think that what results\nis a newly cogent form of the cosmological argument: he is not giving\nan argument at all. What he is doing, we might say, is to bring out\nthe religious resonance of the concept of contingency: the role of the\nconcept is not simply to signify the possibility of not-being but,\nwhen appropriated in the way he describes, to draw us into a life of\n\u201cthanksgiving\u201d. As he says, solitude, and being free from\nthe feeling of technological mastery that is characteristic of urban\nlife, \u201cteaches thanks\u201d (p. 188).\n\nSimilarly Koh\u00e1k comments that\n\nThe natural world, abandoned by a human dweller, does not disintegrate\ninto a meaningless aggregate. It may seem that way as the ridge of the\nabandoned barn sags and caves in\u2026 That, though, is only the\nhuman order of passing. \u2026 The nature abandoned by humans is yet\nnot abandoned. It is not simply that it is lawlike in performance,\nmanifesting observed regularities. Its order is far more intimate than\nthat. It is the order of a sphere of mineness. (1984, p. 189)\n\n\nStandard versions of the argument from design, when they appeal to the\nworld\u2019s lawlikeness, do not require any reference to the\nphenomenology of human experience. But, here, Koh\u00e1k is giving a\nphenomenological rendering of the concept of order, and seeking to\nroot our sense of the divine presence in this more\n\u201cintimate,\u201d phenomenologically informed understanding of\nthe world\u2019s regularity.\n\nAgain, as with the concept of contingency, his concern is to bring out\nthe existential import of the concept of order. When grounded in the\nkind of experience he describes here, order does not just signify\nlawlikeness, a notion that has no particular phenomenological content,\nbut a realm of belonging, a place that has been set in order by\nsomeone, so that it can be inhabited and constitute a home. This way\nof developing the concept points once more to its relevance for\nreligious life: to experience order in these terms is to experience\nGod as present in the world, and as caring for it.\n\nSo we could take Koh\u00e1k to be providing a phenomenological\nrendering of the concept of divine presence. He offers this\ncomparison:\n\nThe house belongs: on entering it, we sense its order not simply as an\norder, but specifically as the order of a Lebenswelt, of an inhabited\ncontext ordered by a caring presence. Trying to cook in a strange\nkitchen brings it home: things have their places, unknown to us, but\nnot arbitrary. The house is a sphere of someone\u2019s mineness. (p.\n189)\n\n\nIt might be said: the content of the concept of divine presence is\nreally given, surely, in standard philosophical and theological\nanalyses of it. To say that God is omnipresent, for example, is to say\nthat God is directly active in all places, or that God has unmediated\nknowledge of, and power over, everything that happens wherever it\nhappens. (See Aquinas, Summa Theologiae 1a. 8. 3 and Swinburne 1993.)\nOn this view, Koh\u00e1k\u2019s observations constitute a kind of\npsychological gloss on the concept: we human beings sometimes register\nthe divine presence in such experiences of \u201cmineness,\u201d but\nthese experiences form no part of the concept.\n\nIt is implied in Koh\u00e1k\u2019s discussion that the experience\nof mineness enters more deeply into our understanding of divine\npresence than this account would suggest. Analogously we might say\nthat if we are to have a full understanding of what it is for\nsomething to be blue, then we require firsthand experience of\nblueness, since someone who has not had this experience will not know\nthis truth about blue: that it is manifest in human experience in this\nway. (Compare the example of Mary, developed in Jackson 1982.)\n\nKoh\u00e1k is suggesting, I think, that our understanding of divine\npresence, or equally of contingency and order, also has some\nphenomenological content: to see in full what it is for God to be\npresent, one needs to have some experiential knowledge of the contexts\nin which the concept of divine presence originates. Or to put the\nmatter otherwise, he is saying that to see in full the religious\nimport of the concepts of order, contingency and divine presence, to\nsee what role they might play in a religious life, it is necessary to\nhave some appreciation of the relevant phenomenology. (This sort of\npoint is often made in the phenomenological literature by saying that\n\u201cempathy\u201d is required if we are to understand the defining\nconcepts of a faith tradition: see Dupre 1998, pp. 36\u201337.)\n\nThere are parallels here with discussion in ethics, where some\ncommentators have supposed, likewise, that a full appreciation of\ncertain cardinal moral concepts depends upon being able to grasp,\nthrough first hand experience, the relevant phenomenology. Raimond\nGaita, for example, argues that our concept of the individuality of\nother persons (in the sense that is relevant when we speak of them as\nbeing from a moral point of view irreplaceable) is not fully\nexpressible independently of reference to the phenomenology of our\nmoral experience. The sense of this concept is given in, for instance,\nthe experience of being haunted by the victim of your wrong-doing,\nwhere it this particular individual who haunts you, rather than some\nrepresentative of humanity in general, or someone whose individuality\ncan be adequately specified simply by reference to, for example, their\ndistinguishing empirical properties (of hair colour, height, or\nwhatever it may be) (1991, p. 51).\n\nIn the same sort of way, Koh\u00e1k is taking the notion of divine\npresence, when it functions in religiously resonant ways, to be rooted\nin certain experiences of the world, so that someone who lacks those\nexperiences will not have the same idea of divine presence. This\nthought might seem to offend against the public character of our\nconcepts. But it is perhaps more a matter of the public meaning of\ncertain concepts being open to deepening relative to experience. Iris\nMurdoch remarks similarly on how a person\u2019s concept of courage\nat the age of twenty is not the same as their concept of courage at\nthe age of forty: life experience contributes to a deepening of the\nconcept (1985, p. 29).\n\nWe have been considering various understandings of the phenomenology\nof religious experience, where religious experience may be construed\nas an encounter with God as a particular entity, or as, in the first\ninstance, an encounter with a material context, given by our built or\nnatural environment or some combination of these. In this latter case,\nit may be that God is manifest not so much as a particular item in the\nperceptual field, but by way of the significance that attaches to a\nmaterial context, rather as, on Koh\u00e1k\u2018s view, our sense\nof the divine presence is grounded in a recognition of the\nsignificance that attaches to the forest as a realm of\n\u201cmineness.\u201d In this way, different emphases in the\nphenomenology of religion are likely to correlate with different\nconceptions of God: not only in so far as a given conception of God\nhas a distinctive phenomenal content, but also in so far as different\nphenomenologies are likely to be associated with different conceptions\nof the sense in which God may be regarded as\n\u201cindividual.\u201d\n",
