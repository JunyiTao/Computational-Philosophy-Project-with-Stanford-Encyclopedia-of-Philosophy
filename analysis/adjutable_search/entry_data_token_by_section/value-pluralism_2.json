The Attraction of Pluralism\n\nIf values are plural, then choices between them will be complex.\nPluralists have pressed the point that choices are complex, and so we\nshould not shy away from the hypothesis that values are plural. In\nbrief, the attraction of pluralism is that it seems to allow for the\ncomplexity and conflict that is part of our moral experience. We do\nnot experience our moral choices as simple additive puzzles.\nPluralists have argued that there are incommensurabilities and\ndiscontinuities in value comparisons, value remainders (or residues)\nwhen choices are made, and complexities in appropriate responses to\nvalue. Recent empirical work confirms that our ethical experience is\nof apparently irreducible plural values. (See Gill and Nichols,\n2008.)\n",
