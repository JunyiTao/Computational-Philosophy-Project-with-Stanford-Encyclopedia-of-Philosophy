    "main_text": "\n\nThe ethics of parenthood and procreation apply not only to daily acts\nof decision-making by parents and prospective procreators, but also to\nlaw, public policy, and medicine. Two recent social and technological\nshifts make this topic especially pressing. First, changing family\ndemographics mean that children are increasingly reared in blended\nfamilies, by single parents, or by same-sex partners, prompting\nquestions of who should be considered a child\u2019s parent and what\ngood parenting requires. Second, the development and proliferation of\n\u201cAssisted Reproductive Technology\u201d (ART) raises questions\nconcerning access to the technology, its permissibility, and its use\nto enhance future children or prevent the birth of children with\ncertain conditions. Recent debate in ethics and political philosophy\nhas focused on the following questions:\n\nAre there any procreative rights? If so, what are they? What, if\nanything, limits them? When, if at all, is it morally permissible to\nprocreate? What may procreators permissibly aim at in choosing\ncharacteristics of potential children? What are the moral constraints\non the means of procreation? \nWhat are the grounds of parenthood? In what respects is parenthood a\nbiological or natural relationship, and in what respects a social or\nconventional one? \nWhat are the scope and limits of parental rights and responsibilities?\nWhat must parents provide for their children? How should their\nparental responsibilities weigh against other obligations? What should\nparents be allowed to do, and when may, or must, public agencies\nintervene? What, if anything, does society owe parents? What do\nco-parents owe each other? \n\n\nIn the following entry, we divide these questions into three\nsequential stages: the ethics of procreation (creating a child), to\nwhich we devote two sections, and then becoming parents (acquiring\nparental rights and responsibilities) and being parents (holding and\ndischarging parental rights and responsibilities).\n",
