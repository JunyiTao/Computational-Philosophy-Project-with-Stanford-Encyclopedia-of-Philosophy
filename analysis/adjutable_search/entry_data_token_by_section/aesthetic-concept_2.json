    "main_text": "The Concept of Taste || Disinterest\n1.2 Disinterest\n\nEgoism about virtue is the view that to judge an action or trait\nvirtuous is to take pleasure in it because you believe it to serve\nsome interest of yours. Its central instance is the Hobbesian\nview\u2014still very much on early eighteenth-century\nminds\u2014that to judge an action or trait virtuous is to take\npleasure in it because you believe it to promote your safety. Against\nHobbesian egoism a number of British moralists\u2014preeminently\nShaftesbury, Hutcheson, and Hume\u2014argued that, while a judgment\nof virtue is a matter of taking pleasure in response to an action or\ntrait, the pleasure is disinterested, by which they meant that it is\nnot self-interested (Cooper 1711, 220\u2013223; Hutcheson 1725, 9,\n25\u201326; Hume 1751, 218\u2013232, 295\u2013302). One argument\nwent roughly as follows. That we judge virtue by means of an immediate\nsensation of pleasure means that judgments of virtue are judgments of\ntaste, no less than judgments of beauty. But pleasure in the beautiful\nis not self-interested: we judge objects to be beautiful whether or\nnot we believe them to serve our interests. But if pleasure in the\nbeautiful is disinterested, there is no reason to think that pleasure\nin the virtuous cannot also be (Hutcheson 1725, 9\u201310).\n\nThe eighteenth-century view that judgments of virtue are judgments of\ntaste highlights a difference between the eighteenth-century concept\nof taste and our concept of the aesthetic, since for us the concepts\naesthetic and moral tend oppose one another such\nthat a judgment\u2019s falling under one typically precludes its\nfalling under the other. Kant is chiefly responsible for introducing\nthis difference. He brought the moral and the aesthetic into\nopposition by re-interpreting what we might call the disinterest\nthesis\u2014the thesis that pleasure in the beautiful is\ndisinterested (though see Cooper 1711, 222 and Home 2005, 36\u201338\nfor anticipations of Kant\u2019s re-interpretation).\n\nAccording to Kant, to say that a pleasure is interested is not to say\nthat it is self-interested in the Hobbesian sense, but rather that it\nstands in a certain relation to the faculty of desire. The pleasure\ninvolved in judging an action to be morally good is interested because\nsuch a judgment issues in a desire to bring the action into existence,\ni.e., to perform it. To judge an action to be morally good is to\nbecome aware that one has a duty to perform the action, and to become\nso aware is to gain a desire to perform it. By contrast, the pleasure\ninvolved in judging an object to be beautiful is disinterested because\nsuch a judgment issues in no desire to do anything in particular. If\nwe can be said to have a duty with regard to beautiful things, it\nappears to be exhausted in our judging them aesthetically to be\nbeautiful. That is what Kant means when he says that the judgment of\ntaste is not practical but rather \u201cmerely contemplative\u201d\n(Kant 1790, 95).\n\nBy thus re-orienting the notion of disinterest, Kant brought the\nconcept of taste into opposition with the concept of morality, and so\ninto line, more or less, with the present concept of the aesthetic.\nBut if the Kantian concept of taste is continuous, more or less, with\nthe present-day concept of the aesthetic, why the terminological\ndiscontinuity? Why have we come to prefer the term\n\u2018aesthetic\u2019 to the term \u2018taste\u2019? The not very\ninteresting answer appears to be that we have preferred an adjective\nto a noun. The term \u2018aesthetic\u2019 derives from the Greek\nterm for sensory perception, and so preserves the implication of\nimmediacy carried by the term \u2018taste.\u2019 Kant employed both\nterms, though not equivalently: according to his usage,\n\u2018aesthetic\u2019 is broader, picking out a class of judgments\nthat includes both the normative judgment of taste and the\nnon-normative, though equally immediate, judgment of the agreeable.\nThough Kant was not the first modern to use \u2018aesthetic\u2019\n(Baumgarten had used it as early as 1735), the term became widespread\nonly, though quickly, after his employment of it in the third\nCritique. Yet the employment that became widespread was not exactly\nKant\u2019s, but a narrower one according to which\n\u2018aesthetic\u2019 simply functions as an adjective corresponding\nto the noun \u201ctaste.\u201d So for example we find Coleridge, in\n1821, expressing the wish that he \u201ccould find a more familiar\nword than aesthetic for works of taste and criticism,\u201d before\ngoing on to argue:\n\nAs our language \u2026 contains no other useable adjective,\nto express coincidence of form, feeling, and intellect, that\nsomething, which, confirming the inner and the outward senses, becomes\na new sense in itself \u2026 there is reason to hope, that the term\naesthetic, will be brought into common use. (Coleridge 1821,\n254)\n\n\nThe availability of an adjective corresponding to \u201ctaste\u201d\nhas allowed for the retiring of a series of awkward expressions: the\nexpressions \u201cjudgment of taste,\u201d \u201cemotion of\ntaste\u201d and \u201cquality of taste\u201d have given way to the\narguably less offensive \u2018aesthetic judgment,\u2019\n\u2018aesthetic emotion,\u2019 and \u2018aesthetic quality.\u2019\nHowever, as the noun \u2018taste\u2019 phased out, we became saddled\nwith other perhaps equally awkward expressions, including the one that\nnames this entry.\n",
